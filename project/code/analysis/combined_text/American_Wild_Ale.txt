vintage
not
my
kind
of
sour
beer
i
am
not
a
sour
lover
so
you
have
see
my
review
like
this
drank
it
during
an
epic
bcbs
tasting
to
clean
the
palet
overall
i
drank
the
2009
first
and
gave
up
most
hope
for
the
beer
the
2010
was
much
better
im
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
of
2009
or
if
its
just
past
its
prime
but
2010
is
much
better

nice

beautiful

lightly

somewhat
sour
great
with

tart
and
sour
that
is
all
d
i
am
a
huge
juliet
fan
and
enjoyed
the
almost
1
year
of
age
on
the
bottle
it
felt
more
enjoyable
and
was
still
plenty
sour
ill
have
to
open
my
other
bottles
soon
of
a
group
of
four
for
the
bottle
share
the
consensus
was
that
this
beer
was
better
than
both
oblivion
and
love
child
no
4
that
both
of
those
beers
were
excellent
should
impress
on
you
just
how
tasty
this
brew
was
2013
765ml
let
this
one
age
for
at
least
a
year
one
of
the
best
tartfruit
brews
ive
tasted
recently
my
favorite
out
of
the
goose
island
sister
series
ill
be
buying
a
few
to
sit
for
awhile
has
a
lovely
tangy
taste
and
the
8
abv
is
cleverly
hidden
by
the
various
other
flavors
of
oak
wild
yeasts
blackberry
and
rye
malt
subtle
2012
edition
thats
been
waiting
to
be
let
out
lots
of
funk
upfront
acidic
piercing
funky
barnyard
tart
well
rounded
and
really
comes
together
as
it
warms
a
little
good
prickly
carbonation
dances
around
as
advertised
a
great
sourwild
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
interested
in
a
representation
of
what
the
style
should
be
o
while
very
good
i
had
to
compare
this
to
new
glarus
very
sour
blackberry
it
held
its
own
and
was
tasty
great
bubbly
feel
almost
like
a
champagne
followed
sour
sweetness
of
blackberries
great
nose
has
all
the
sour
characteristics
that
you
hope
for
appearance
is
a
nice
orange
amber
with
very
little
head
retention
and
super
clear
definitely
top
5
for
me
light
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
has
a
tart
fruit
aftertaste
a
very
nice
easy
beer
to
drink
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
am
now
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
gi
sister
beers
overall
total
sour
pucker
tart
funk
deliciousness
i
like
it
a
lot
juliet
pours
a
amberish
color
with
no
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
there
is
a
strong
sour
aroma
very
yeasty
and
very
sweet
the
taste
is
very
acidic
sour
lots
of
yeast
and
nice
subtle
blackberry
colors
very
bold
strong
flavors
good
to
sip
on
overall
a
very
powerful
enjoyable
wild
ale
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
im
a
little
confused
by
the
fact
that
this
particular
sister
sour
is
more
expensive
than
lolita
because
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
perhaps
its
just
a
factor
of
production
totals
certainly
one
of
the
better
americanmade
sours
that
is
widely
available
calling
to
mind
traditional
belgian
styles
like
kriek
and
flanders
red
but
as
noted
the
unique
elementblackberriessimply
doesnt
come
through
in
a
way
that
would
really
make
this
brew
truly
oneofakind
surprisingly
intense
sour
beer
lots
of
character
not
for
amateurs
the
beer
pours
a
rich
pale
purple
with
an
amber
flair
it
sits
in
the
glass
as
a
rich
rose
color
with
a
small
head
of
offwhite
bubbles
that
quickly
leaves
in
body
the
beer
is
a
deep
colorful
murk
with
a
definite
opacity
to
it
when
splashed
against
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
leaves
a
receding
tide
of
lacing
on
the
nose
this
thing
is
richly
acidic
with
tart
lemon
rich
blackberry
blueberry
and
even
fresh
and
antiseptic
mint
on
a
second
sniff
i
receive
rich
lightly
toasted
oak
soft
malt
vinegar
and
smooth
caramel
malt
as
i
sniff
more
and
more
i
do
get
a
sense
of
chlorine
and
pool
house
air
which
isnt
completely
offputting
but
is
odd
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
hugely
vinous
with
rich
acidity
that
blossoms
into
sweet
fruit
very
faint
salinity
and
the
briefest
kiss
of
herbal
bitters
the
finish
is
rich
with
oak
tannin
sweet
fruit
and
soft
acidity
in
flavor
this
beer
is
delicately
beautiful
it
begins
as
a
rich
tide
of
lime
and
lemon
citrus
that
erupts
into
rich
berry
notes
mixing
strawberry
blackberry
and
blueberry
this
is
then
ballooned
outwards
by
a
rich
lightly
roasted
oak
and
soft
earthy
characters
the
finish
returns
to
bright
citrus
that
blends
the
berry
and
oak
into
a
long
and
fruitforward
finish
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
plus
side
of
medium
with
a
rich
jamlike
mouthfeel
that
gives
a
lovely
bristle
of
fruit
skin
carbonation
is
soft
but
gives
a
nice
sparkle
and
snap
to
the
sip
that
keeps
the
beer
from
feeling
heavy
or
syrupy
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
wet
and
sticky
from
saliva
as
i
drink
more
and
more
the
beer
does
become
a
little
syrupy
and
left
the
tongue
feeling
a
little
heavy
the
tannins
add
a
touch
of
astringency
that
really
helps
with
balancing
out
the
syrupy
sweetness
overall
this
beer
is
impeccably
balanced
the
syrupy
sweetness
does
win
out
as
you
drink
more
and
more
of
it
but
it
is
never
tiring
to
sip
and
the
rich
subtle
complexity
in
flavor
makes
it
quite
enjoyable
goose
island
must
have
a
hell
of
cellar
and
their
blenders
tongue
must
be
really
refined
because
this
beer
is
miles
ahead
of
many
of
the
other
american
wild
ales
haters
be
damned
goose
island
has
still
got
it
and
it
is
very
good
d
extremely
refreshing
and
drinkable
abv
is
very
well
hidden
a
light
and
airy
brew
that
does
not
disappoint
overall
the
first
goose
island
beer
to
wow
me
and
wow
did
it
wow
me
overall
a
very
good
sour
though
not
on
the
same
level
as
the
sours
from
russian
river
one
can
taste
the
fruit
in
those
sours
and
it
adds
a
balancing
sweetness
to
the
sour
notes
i
prefer
those
kinds
of
sours
and
wish
more
brewers
would
strive
to
emulate
them
instead
of
bombarding
us
with
acidity
the
way
they
try
to
oneup
each
other
with
hop
profiles
in
iipas
still
this
is
a
superb
wild
ale
and
fans
of
sour
bombs
should
seek
it
out
overall
i
need
to
find
more
of
this
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
i
see
a
lot
of
reviews
of
other
wild
ales
that
say
not
sour
enough
this
will
for
sure
cure
that
need
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
supplication
i
give
the
slight
edge
to
juliet
for
context

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
ooverall
a
great
sour
the
tartness
was
balanced
with
the
dry
crispness
of
the
wine
and
wild
yeast
even
if
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
in
the
long
run
its
worth
a
try
if
youre
willing
to
shell
out
the
money
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
their
other
sours
o
a
very
nice
sour
that
has
hints
of
greatness
the
jamlike
blackberry
flavors
are
fantastic
but
the
overwhelming
blue
sweet
tart
flavors
sometimes
get
in
the
way
all
in
all
a
very
nice
sour
appearance
is
a
orangish
pink
light
carbonation
upon
initial
pour
which
dissipates
into
just
a
subtle
amount
of
bubbles
hiding
unless
you
hold
the
glass
closely
up
to
light
i
smell
barnyard
funk
straight
brett
there
is
a
dryness
exemplified
by
the
wine
barrel
on
the
back
end
tastes
juicy
with
the
blackberry
fruit
bursting
at
each
sip
the
brett
character
is
apparent
definitely
keeping
the
sweetness
in
check
carbonation
is
light
on
the
palate
but
i
think
its
just
fine
for
the
style
overall
a
nice
american
wild
that
showcases
great
fruit
character
i
loved
this
and
the
lolita
i
had
a
few
nights
back
excellent
sour
or
wild
ale
that
gives
strong
belgian
impression
and
matches
many
of
the
better
belgian
wild
and
sour
ales
very
recommended
and
glad
i
purchased
a
second
for
cellaring
b
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
so
far
its
the
best
american
wild
ale
i
have
ever
had
it
took
this
style
to
a
whole
new
level
for
me
and
i
never
thought
that
loads
of
tartness
could
work
that
well
in
a
beer
it
really
changed
the
way
that
i
look
at
this
style
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
for
as
tart
and
sour
as
it
is
it
still
goes
down
smooth
and
it
was
dry
clean
crisp
and
the
taste
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
keeping
me
coming
back
for
more
but
i
would
have
a
hard
time
limiting
myself
to
just
one
glass
since
i
think
any
more
then
that
and
it
would
just
be
too
acidic
for
me
but
i
think
its
a
great
beer
to
split
with
one
or
two
other
people
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
well
the
high
level
of
tartness
worked
with
this
beer
it
blew
my
mind
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
i
thought
the
color
was
great
but
unfortunately
the
head
and
lacing
didnt
match
that
and
it
ended
up
looking
fairly
wine
like
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
ever
saw
it
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
grab
a
few
bottles
and
see
how
it
changes
over
time
and
for
12
i
think
this
is
a
bargain
i
highly
recommend
this
to
people
who
are
a
fan
of
the
style
and
even
to
people
who
are
just
starting
to
get
familiar
with
the
style
like
me
all
in
all
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
didnt
know
i
could
like
an
american
wile
ale
this
much
but
somehow
goose
island
managed
to
show
me
how
good
this
style
can
actually
be
and
they
are
quickly
gaining
my
respect
by
producing
these
incredible
american
wild
ales
and
belgian
inspired
beers
escoffier
was
my
favorite
american
wild
ale
but
now
it
is
juliet
great
job
guys
this
is
now
my
favorite
goose
island
beer
and
now
i
really
want
to
try
the
remaining
sisters
that
i
have
yet
to
get
a
hold
of
thanks
for
the
experience
othis
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
goose
island
sisters
i
find
it
complex
very
vinous
pleasantly
sour
and
wellmatched
with
food
the
flavors
arent
very
distinct
or
i
just
cant
describe
them
well
but
i
know
that
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
it
is
probably
too
expensive
but
i
found
myself
thinking
about
buying
another
bottle
after
drinking
this
one
on
christmas
o
a
great
wild
ale
with
berry
and
wine
flavors
medium
body
tingly
and
ample
carbonation
on
the
tongue
im
rating
this
just
above
outstanding
because
1
it
made
me
enjoy
a
beer
with
an
element
that
i
usually
dont
and
2
its
balanced
with
not
too
much
red
wine
character
and
very
drinkable
would
definitely
drink
again
sometimes
less
is
more
and
thats
why
this
beer
wins
for
me
overall
a
pretty
good
wild
ale
as
mentioned
above
comparable
to
rodenbach
or
maybe
the
dissident
but
at
about
twice
the
price
probably
not
worth
coming
back
to

has

here
cheers
should
another
bottle
come
into
my
possession
i
would
probably
cellar
it
for
at
least
a
year
or
two
to
allow
for
further
evolution
of
flavor
especially
in
regards
to
brettanomyces
or
any
wild
yeast
as
it
stands
this
is
a
nice
enough
beer
to
consume
fresh
and
in
my
opinion
worth
a
try
as
someone
whos
still
more
of
an
appreciator
rather
than
lover
of
sours
i
quite
liked
this
great
aroma
great
complexity
thanks
to
railroad
street
bar
and
grill
in
limerick
pa
for
hooking
me
up
if
you
are
in
the
area
they
have
a
limited
amount
in
bottles
available
overall
very
good
beer
i
dont
like
to
drink
inbev
but
when
i
do
its
goose
islands
premier
beers
worth
a
try
if
30
bucks
doesnt
bother
you
if
you
find
it
for
as
cheap
as
i
did
grab
it
interesting
gi
sour
not
the
best
sour
by
any
means
but
its
not
bad
wish
this
has
a
cleaner
lighter
flavour
and
mouthfeel
like
the
belgians
do
this
is
a
bit
heavyhanded
but
this
is
gi
after
all
overall
another
good
one
from
goose
island
id
like
to
see
them
tone
down
the
lactic
character
a
bit
as
it
detracted
a
bit
from
some
of
the
the
other
complexities
of
the
beer
but
not
so
much
so
that
it
wasnt
still
enjoyable
worth
picking
up
if
you
find
it
reasonably
priced
goose
island
juliet
45
nice
berry
and
wine
flavors
with
leveled
out
tartness
not
sure
how
this
would
continue
to
age
but
quite
good
at
this
point
tons
of
fruit
flavors
and
huge
lactic
sourness
super
wild
feel
very
enjoyable
and
hoping
that
gi
can
produce
more
beers
like
this
in
the
future
o
very
interesting
sour
a
bit
of
balanced
sweet
and
sour
up
front
but
turns
into
a
drawn
out
acetic
tartness
great
berry
flavor
throughout
one
the
best
sours
ive
had
very
flavorful
almost
a
little
too
tart
but
im
still
a
beginner
o
ive
had
a
number
of
sours
but
this
is
one
that
im
ranking
highly
i
love
the
blend
of
sourness
and
sweetness
that
makes
this
beer
goose
island
did
a
terrific
job
with
this
one
if
the
price
wasnt
so
high
paid
20
for
22
oz
i
would
be
picking
up
more
now
cheers
easy
feel
plenty
of
carbonation
but
nothing
astringent
crisp
and
refreshing
the
flavor
profile
on
this
one
keeps
me
gulping
tart
blackberry
lemon
lactic
character
oaky
dryness
fruity
finish
from
the
barreling
for
sure
this
beer
disappeared
quickly
loved
it
thanks
again
ed
o
not
that
interesting
minimal
depth
or
complexity
nothing
to
seek
out
pours
a
lightly
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
bone
white
head
that
that
dissipates
as
quickly
as
the
bubbles
in
a
glass
of
ginger
ale
tart
and
funky
fruit
dominate
the
aroma
here
lemons
cherries
and
berries
with
lots
of
lactic
sourness
and
funk
make
up
most
of
the
nose
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
deep
in
the
background
the
flavor
puckers
your
face
up
front
with
lemons
and
tart
cherries
light
brown
sugar
malt
sneaks
in
before
the
citric
return
and
burns
a
hole
deep
into
your
nether
region
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
nice
american
wild
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
very
tart
dry
and
flavorful
really
well
rounded
and
enjoyable
loved
it
cheers
jay
tart
and
delightful
good
balance
of
fruit
and
tart
magic
this
is
wet
funky
and
tart
its
very
interesting
with
some
nice
berry
notes
if
this
were
easier
to
get
i
would
buy
it
again
this
bottle
is
from
2012
and
i
would
imagine
it
gets
more
complex
or
something
last
one
from
an
awesome
box
from
deyholla
pours
a
beautiful
deep
ruby
orange
with
tiny
fizzy
head
that
recedes
quickly
smell
is
sour
vinegar
and
very
sweet
fruit
and
berries
flavor
is
sour
up
front
with
a
smooth
berry
finish
the
berry
is
not
too
sweet
and
has
just
the
right
balance
with
the
sour
and
barrel
notes
prickly
carbonation
and
lightmedium
mouthfeel
awesome
sour
probably
my
favorite
of
the
gi
ladies
o
initially
graded
this
a
little
harshly
but
then
changed
my
mind
that
i
should
keep
the
belgians
out
of
my
mind
when
rating
an
american
sour
hard
to
do
but
the
style
says
so
so
for
an
american
wild
this
is
great
it
is
easily
my
favorite
out
of
the
3
sisters
though
all
are
fair
examples
of
american
interpretations
of
sour
beer
for
someone
new
to
this
beer
id
definitely
recommend
one
fresh
and
one
for
cellar
if
possible
as
some
time
may
dry
this
out
a
pretty
great
beer
for
a
sour
fan
i
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
distributed
around
here
so
i
could
give
it
a
proper
review
but
these
where
my
impression
when
i
had
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
it
while
out
of
town
they
where
serving
this
in
bottles
at
the
city
beer
hall
in
albany
ny
2
years
have
done
this
well
wish
it
wasnt
my
last
bottle
2012
vintage
i
should
be
fair
to
this
beer
and
admit
that
i
enjoyed
it
in
the
same
session
as
several
new
glarus
sours
a
consecration
and
yes
a
cantillon
saint
lamvinus
so
some
features
that
came
across
as
lackluster
or
negative
might
actually
not
be
so
in
another
light
but
i
had
one
bottle
and
its
been
consumed
so
here
we
go
pours
a
unique
mix
of
orangey
rust
and
rose
pink
they
kind
of
wash
eachother
out
in
a
hazy
melted
crayon
look
a
finger
or
two
of
off
white
foam
dies
right
away
the
nose
is
quite
sour
and
fruity
cherries
maybe
lots
of
vinegar
and
lemon
it
smells
as
bretty
as
it
does
like
a
kitchen
cleaner
for
hippies
but
im
being
critical
the
taste
is
quite
good
again
with
the
fruit
maybe
wild
raspberry
or
something
in
there
providing
that
tartness
along
with
what
must
be
a
heavy
dose
of
lemon
peel
and
some
sour
yeast
which
is
quite
intense
towards
the
finish
lots
of
acid
and
lots
of
residual
sugar
not
a
combo
i
usually
like
at
the
tail
end
of
a
beer
but
they
seem
to
neutralize
eachother
reasonably
well
here
really
poppy
mouthfeel
gnarly
carbonation
over
just
a
medium
body
long
drawn
out
aftertaste
of
lemony
yeasty
funk
i
also
taste
some
tonic
water
in
here
especially
in
the
aftertaste
which
i
cant
explain
but
i
dont
care
for
at
all
this
one
starts
better
than
it
ends
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
the
complexity
through
the
sourness
we
were
very
excited
when
we
first
sipped
this
beer
as
the
tart
brett
really
takes
off
robustly
from
the
start
the
entire
time
youre
trying
to
pick
apart
all
of
the
flavors
that
make
it
so
puckering
but
keep
it
so
drinkable
and
juicy
we
do
wish
that
the
blackberry
was
more
present
in
its
sweetness
alongside
its
sourness
either
way
this
beer
had
an
excellent
flavor
and
was
insanely
drinkable
overall
solid
better
than
lolita
by
a
fair
margin
muted
fruit
notes
yield
a
nice
sour
beer
behind
it
o
overall
quite
a
good
brew
here
it
has
the
big
sour
notes
i
look
for
in
a
wild
and
a
nice
bit
of
funk
and
oak
barrel
characters
as
well
i
would
have
liked
the
raspberries
to
be
a
little
more
prominent
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
not
mind
blowing
but
id
drink
again
in
heartbeat
i
recommend
juliet
is
a
really
nice
release
from
goose
island
ive
wanted
to
try
it
for
a
while
expectations
were
high
for
the
most
part
they
were
met
i
could
handle
maybe
just
a
little
less
tartness
and
a
few
more
bubbles
those
two
tweaks
would
improve
it
in
my
book
still
a
very
impressive
beer
nevertheless
this
is
a
disappointment
for
me
not
that
much
is
here
just
thin
acidic
and
overly
carbonated
this
is
not
something
i
care
to
revisit
or
finish
for
that
matter
not
something
i
would
recommend
o
a
tart
and
refreshing
sour
definitely
the
most
tart
and
sour
of
the
three
sisters
nice
to
see
gi
step
up
production
of
this
and
the
other
sisters
to
give
the
midwest
a
nice
and
easily
accessible
sour
option
overall
a
really
impressive
fruit
foward
wild
ale
definitely
one
of
the
more
impressive
examples
of
an
example
fruited
wild
i
have
had
the
berries
provide
a
nice
touch
of
raspberry
flavors
nice
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
i
would
definitely
enjoy
revisiting
this
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
overall
a
very
nice
beer
very
tasty
indeed
notes
less
of
a
memorable
aroma
than
lolita
but
a
better
rounded
brew
although
not
that
far
off
the
range
o
overall
this
really
has
an
average
appearance
as
well
as
aroma
but
the
taste
really
grew
on
me
quite
tart
was
really
hoping
for
a
wild
that
showcases
the
berries
but
this
beer
just
shows
up
with
sour
tart
more
sour
no
rye
berries
scarcely
noticeable
blah
still
tasty
just
not
what
was
advertised
pretty
good
beer
i
could
drink
this
for
a
while
without
getting
board
a
fair
bit
going
on
and
i
like
everything
thats
happening
worth
seeking
out
d
a
tasty
and
ultimately
drinkable
offering
from
gi
all
the
care
and
consideration
put
into
brewing
beers
like
this
really
comes
through
with
beers
like
juliet
there
was
some
talk
a
while
back
about
gi
coming
to
canada
and
while
i
doubt
offerings
like
juliet
will
see
their
way
north
of
the
border
id
welcome
more
from
them
after
this
brew
thats
for
sure
i
have
been
consistently
blown
away
by
goose
islands
bourbon
county
brand
stout
variants
and
now
i
know
that
they
can
make
an
amazing
version
of
a
wild
ale
as
well
this
beer
ranks
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
sour
ales
i
have
ever
tried
truly
a
superb
offering
o
great
wild
ale
from
gi
710
sourness
gives
a
nice
pucker
from
the
sourness
but
has
enough
raspberry
to
balance
this
beer
and
make
it
very
enjoyable
22
ounce
bottle
its
a
2012
bottle
but
theres
no
bottling
date
printed
on
the
label
served
in
a
unibroue
tulip
the
beer
pours
an
orangered
color
with
a
half
inch
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
nice
and
sour
it
smells
like
tart
berries
oak
and
red
wine
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
except
that
the
berry
flavor
tastes
more
like
sweet
and
tart
blackberries
and
that
the
sourness
is
stronger
in
comparison
to
the
aroma
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
liked
this
beer
its
tasty
and
tart
so
i
cant
complain
about
that
15
99
a
bottle
o
the
black
berries
and
red
wine
barrel
really
play
off
each
other
nicely
the
lacto
sourness
cuts
the
sweetness
of
the
berries
and
the
malt
body
brings
it
all
together
a
very
solid
sour
overall
and
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
o
good
flavor
and
goes
for
that
super
sour
beer
thing
i
do
like
the
not
so
subtleness
but
can
only
handle
so
much
poured
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
reddish
copper
with
zero
head
aromatic
notes
of
wood
tannin
dark
fruit
and
spice
make
juliet
an
ideal
beer
to
suggest
to
pinot
noir
enthusiasts
and
beer
drinkers
who
are
fond
of
belgian
sour
ales
flavors
of
tart
fruit
definitely
a
complex
ale
while
an
interesting
and
complex
brew
this
did
not
cut
it
for
me
as
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
sours
myself
o
a
very
interesting
sour
beer
i
think
that
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
pour
is
a
dark
transparent
ruby
red
with
a
beige
tiny
bubbled
head
nose
is
heavy
tart
berry
fair
amount
of
dry
wood
hints
of
lacto
and
vanilla
light
brett
leather
note
taste
is
heavy
sour
dark
berry
lightly
lactic
wood
isnt
there
near
as
much
as
the
nose
body
is
lightly
dry
a
hint
syrupy
rather
puckering
and
highly
carbonated
not
bad
pretty
sour
strong
berry
note
not
too
much
else
overall
this
beer
took
me
by
surprise
and
was
pretty
kick
ass
overall
a
really
good
take
on
a
sour
a
good
combination
of
tart
and
sweet
fruits
bold
but
not
overbearing
with
the
sourness
and
acid
a
very
tasty
fruit
sour
im
most
impressed
by
the
balance
between
the
berry
fruitiness
and
the
tart
sour
another
impressive
beer
from
goose
island
overall
amazing
balance
brett
mainly
in
the
nose
dont
get
much
blackberries
but
the
wine
barrel
really
came
through
one
of
the
best
american
wild
ales
ive
ever
had
i
got
a
750ml
bottle
of
the
2012
in
spring
2012
pours
a
copper
orange
that
is
hazy
and
has
a
slight
but
quickly
disappearing
head
scent
is
strong
of
aged
blackberries
the
taste
is
mostly
of
fermented
blackberries
that
are
fruity
delicious
and
has
a
good
drinking
texture
mixed
with
some
wine
but
im
not
sure
what
kind
of
wine
has
a
dry
finish
a
delicious
beer
that
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
beer
o
this
is
a
really
good
wild
ale
love
the
sourness
and
funkiness
o
a
good
sour
beer
o
very
unique
and
excellent
beer
not
much
different
than
lolita
for
me
lots
of
flavor
nuances
going
on
great
beer
to
give
someone
who
is
a
wine
drinker
and
is
new
to
craft
beer
overall
a
very
good
sour
from
gi
but
nothing
compared
to
the
cantillon
iris
i
had
right
before
o
evaluating
this
beer
is
tough
i
dont
know
if
it
should
be
more
of
a
sour
summerrefreshing
beer
with
light
brett
characters
and
lighter
acidity
or
bigger
and
more
complex
overall
however
there
are
things
i
greatly
enjoyed
the
subtlety
of
a
brett
smell
the
curveball
of
huge
acidity
the
unique
color
o
very
nice
but
pricey
20
in
chicago
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
in
my
personal
opinion
which
doesnt
mean
much
since
i
am
relatively
new
to
sours
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
flanders
red
than
anything
else
o
great
sour
and
tartness
with
a
sweet
cherry
body
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
might
help
that
i
love
black
berries
and
they
shine
nicely
in
the
mix
good
complexity
in
every
sip
american
wild
ales
have
a
pretty
high
ceiling
in
general
juliet
hovers
amongst
other
great
examples
in
the
top
tier
of
sour
craft
beers
an
elegant
offering
from
a
prestigious
brewery
one
otheir
best
sister
beers
4
5
oa
great
sour
better
than
lolita
looking
forward
to
madame
rose
would
be
great
to
try
those
three
blind
o
this
is
a
world
class
wild
ale
the
beers
aromas
and
flavors
are
well
done
i
bought
this
beer
for
13
and
it
was
well
worth
it
i
would
snatch
this
off
the
shelf
in
favor
of
many
other
first
rate
wild
ales
o
the
only
other
sour
ive
had
apart
from
la
folie
and
it
aint
la
folie
this
is
best
split
amongst
multiple
people
because
a
little
really
goes
a
long
way
despite
that
its
still
a
wholly
solid
and
unique
wild
ale
that
any
sour
lovers
would
enjoy
a
totally
awesome
beer
from
goose
island
this
impressed
me
as
much
as
any
of
the
russian
river
sour
beers
o
drinkability
is
soso
since
its
so
damn
tart
and
funky
split
this
two
or
three
ways
and
its
good
well
made
for
sure
and
worth
a
try
overall
a
delicious
sour
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
glad
i
got
two
bottles
just
wish
i
aged
one
o
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
cantillon
kriek
just
strong
mouth
puckering
sour
fruit
only
it
has
light
notes
of
berries
oak
malt
and
rye
in
there
making
it
much
more
interesting
certainly
one
of
the
better
executed
american
wild
ales
i
have
tried
well
played
goose
island
well
played
o
this
is
a
great
sour
i
love
blackberries
and
while
i
expected
a
stronger
blackberry
presence
i
am
actual
happy
that
this
beer
is
what
it
is
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
without
a
single
dominant
note
other
than
the
funk
i
love
this
and
i
want
more
pours
a
reddish
brown
almost
plum

a
nice
fizzy
white
cap
on
it
that
dissolves
quickly
like
soda
bubbles

berries
a
bit
of
lacto
faint
leather

horse

tart
puckering
blast
of

cherries
blackberries
immediately
following
a
sip
smoothing
out
into
a
brett
middle
with
a
nice
winelike
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
overall
a
very
solid
wild
ale
from
goose
island
would
buy
again
for
certain
o
nicely
complex
wild
ale
wine
barrels
are
not
my
favorite
for
aging
but
they
do
a
nice
job
with
juliet
not
my
favorite
sour
but
well
worth
trying
out
if
you
get
a
chance
well
crafted
clean
and
a
mostly
light
mouthfeel
in
the
texture
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
readily
recommend
overall
a
fantastic
beer
the
16
price
tag
is
a
little
steep
but
this
beer
really
delivers
for
me
nice
firm
sourness
with
a
touch
of
funk
and
fruit
makes
it
a
awesome
beer
to
have
on
this
90
degree
day
m
light
bodied
very
easy
drinking
alcohol
amazing
hidden
dont
taste
it
at
all
overall
very
delicious
never
boring
8
makes
it
a
bit
slower
of
a
sipper
but
really
easy
to
drink
away
on
great
flavor
cannot
see
it
improving
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
ruby
twinge
and
a
slightly
off
white
one
finger
head
which
recedes
to
skim
and
leaves
little
lacing
there
is
sticky
carbonation
bubbles
on
the
side
of
the
glass
and
the
inside
appears
very
carbonated
the
aroma
is
wine
like
with
blackberry
and
cherry
notes
very
present
along
with
a
hint
of
white
grape
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
sour
cherry
flavor
up
front
before
a
white
grape
wine
taste
takes
over
the
back
end
is
all
blackberries
well
blended
and
a
very
good
taste
the
flavor
leaves
you
wanting
more
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
a
bit
stingy
almost
like
a
champagne
overall
a
very
good
beer
great
aroma
and
flavor
i
will
seek
this
out
again
for
sure
o
goose
island
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
and
it
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
8
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
i
wish
i
had
more
such
a
treat
o
though
its
a
good
mix
of
solid
flavors
this
beer
is
not
without
its
weaknesses
mainly
the
huge
presence
of
lactic
acid
still
it
would
go
wonderfully
with
a
variety
of
entrees
or
cheeses
for
that
matter
makes
me
even
more
excited
for
madame
rose
o
a
really
nice
wild
ale
that
has
nice
balance
between
the
berries
and
sourness
a
great
treat
and
wish
my
second
bottle
had
not
spontaneously
exploded
so
i
could
enjoy
it
again
without
searching
o
excellent
wish
i
hadnt
drank
my
2010
now
but
ill
know
that
my
2012s
are
good
for
a
while
o
pretty
new
to
the
sours
and
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
tasting
sour
ive
had
to
date
definitely
would
like
to
see
how
some
of
the
more
renown
sours
such
as
those
brewed
by
rr
standup
to
this
because
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
brew
price
is
very
steep
but
i
have
no
regrets
trying
this
one
out
very
pleased
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
to
the
lolita
a
bit
more
balance
and
drinkability
really
a
delicious
beer
i
think
a
bottle
from
the
2012
release
poured
into
a
small
chalice
this
is
very
well
carbonated
and
a
faded
ruby
color
close
to
a
dark
orange
or
pink
smell
is
very
sour
with
lots
of
funky
acidic
berries
and
grapes
taste
is
very
sour
with
a
citric
flavor
similar
to
a
lemonhead
lots
of
barnyard
funkiness
and
berry
lemonade
flavors
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
at
all
keeping
this
very
drinkable
all
thats
lacking
is
the
intensity
of
complementary
flavors
to
accompany
the
fruit
in
the
same
way
that
belgian
lambics
do
in
the
end
the
beer
has
a
more
simplified
palate
as
does
some
like
cantillon
and
3
fontienen
overall
this
is
a
very
good
good
wild
ale
and
imho
a
touch
better
then
her
sister
lolita
the
blackberries
lend
a
deeper
less
tart
flavor
that
lets
the
brett
and
wine
barrels
come
through
a
bit
more
super
drinkable
for
8
im
intrigued
to
how
these
brews
do
with
a
year
or
two
on
them
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
it
cheers
o
this
is
really
tasty
i
wish
the
rye
and
blackberries
came
through
a
little
more
though
figured
id
celebrate
my
birthday
with
some
bottle
might
as
well
be
a
shelf
sour
check
my
locals
shelf
its
definitely
there
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
sunrise
auburn
topped
by
a
halffinger
at
best
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
berries
light
tart
cherry
very
light
and
very
mild
brett
funk
and
a
kiss
of
vanilla
the
taste
eschews
the
eminent
sweetness
of
the
smell
in
favor
of
a
few
waves
of
varying
degrees
of
sour
tart
berries
sour
cherries
tart
red
wine
a
small
bit
of
straight
brett
funk
and
a
bit
of
white
vinegar
for
the
sake
of
it
nothing
is
exceedingly
powerful
though
allowing
everything
to
meld
together
without
oerwhelming
the
taste
buds
or
peeling
the
enamel
off
of
the
teeth
this
is
what
sour
beer
brewers
should
be
aiming
for
dammit
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bit
o
sour
goodness
one
of
the
premier
beers
ive
yet
had
from
goose
as
a
whole
happy
birthday
to
me
by
far
my
favorite
goose
island
sour
and
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
overall
the
brett
is
well
done
and
complements
the
main
flavors
instead
of
overwhelming
them
as
some
do
again
more
tart
than
sour
but
a
winner
in
my
book
seriously
while
the
tomato
action
really
reminds
me
of
zwanze
2011
this
brew
could
easily
pass
for
a
solid
cantillon
very
impressed
i
quite
liked
this
not
incredible
but
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
overall
this
is
the
last
of
the
three
sisters
from
gi
that
i
had
yet
to
try
and
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
three
hands
down
its
the
most
sour
and
has
a
nice
taste
of
fruit
and
wine
awesome
sour
beer
a
solid
sour
for
sure
but
the
price
point
makes
it
something
i
wont
buy
again
o
a
really
awesome
wild
ale
easily
my
favorite
of
the
gi
sisters
definitely
give
this
a
try
i
would
buy
a
ton
of
this
if
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
o
the
biggest
flaw
a
brewery
can
make
when
making
a
sour
beer
in
my
personal
opinion
is
to
make
it
with
too
much
alcohol
theres
a
reason
why
belgian
masters
stay
at
6
or
lower
any
higher
and
the
alcohol
will
be
too
noticable
the
balance
will
break
as
it
has
here
its
not
horrible
its
just
not
great
also
i
was
told
there
were
blackberries
here
not
a
hint
o
its
wellbalanced
other
than
the
overwhelming
oakiness
and
has
interesting
metaflavors
but
lacks
subtlety
and
complexity

only
hurts
the

mingles

is

i

does

beer
and
all
its
elaborate
flavors
that
weaved
back
and
forth
between
sweet
and
tartsour
letting
a
lot
of
berry
and
yeast
funk
show
off
their
flavor
profiles
a
damn
good
wild
ale
that
i
recommend
trying
amazing
wild
ale
with
a
sour
finish
pours
a
dark
amberreddish
color
with
a
thin
carbonated
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
not
apparent
has
a
sweet
raspberry
aroma
you
can
detect
a
hint
of
tartness
from
the
wild
yeast
strains
has
a
sweet
raspberry
taste
that
is
tart
at
the
end
you
can
taste
the
wine
quality
to
it
can
really
discern
any
hoppiness
to
it
good
beer
but
would
be
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
got
damaged
in
shipping
and
lost
a
lot
of
carbonation
so
my
review
isnt
completely
accurate
overall
a
very
well
done
wild
ale
very
nicely
flavored
tart
raspberry
beer
delicious
lolita
is
a
gem
of
a
beer
this
batch
is
holding
up
like
a
champ
the
raspberry
is
still
vibrant
the
acidity
is
bright
and
the
sheer
enjoyment
is
sky
high
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
this
is
the
oldest
ive
drank
and
it
holds
up
well
pretty
winey
lots
of
raspberry
funky
great
farmhouse
will
definitely
buy
again
overall
id
have
to
say
disappointing
this
beer
is
not
tart
enough
for
me
it
almost
has
a
notsosweet
cranberry
ginger
ale
taste
to
it
obviously
the
individual
attributes
amount
to
ok
to
me
i
see
no
need
for
a
mediocre
beer
like
this
i
feel
like
goose
islands
sours
are
lost
in
the
mix
compared
to
their
other
big
barrelaging
project
but
this
is
quite
nice
overall
never
thought
id
be
into
these
sours
so
much
but
so
delicious
tart
raspberry
oaky
and
discernible
alcohol
lots
of
dry
oak
through
the
middle
with
a
substantial
sour
finish
and
boozy
linger
o
a
mix
of
wild
yeast
fruit
and
tartness
that
works
notably
better
than
average
sour
that
is
all
d
i
really
am
confused
by
the
low
ratings
here
but
what
a
treat
at
three
years
let
me
tell
you
perhaps
this
is
not
the
most
complex
or
sour
of
sours
and
i
am
still
not
incredibly
versed
in
the
wild
ales
arena
however
this
lolita
was
simply
fantastic
goose
island
brings
the
balance
which
is
why
i
think
i
love
their
sisters
line
up
so
much
o
an
awesome
wildsour
ale
this
one
is
1
5
years
old
would
love
to
cellar
another
one
for
another
few
years
and
see
how
it
changes
bottled
12042010
the
age
seems
to
have
made
this
more
drinkable
i
like
the
beer
fresh
but
at
the
four
year
mark
the
sourness
has
faded
a
little
well
blended
between
the
sweet
and
sour
aspects
of
this
gem
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
light
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
wonderful
framboise
type
beer
wild
raspberry
ale
loaded
with
fresh
berry
character
but
a
step
below
stuff
like
cantillon
and
others
pink
and
winey
in
the
glass
not
much
head
after
the
initial
pour
looking
almost
still
but
still
sprightly
on
the
palate
nose
is
huge
lacto
and
barrel
character
not
as
belgian
as
i
expected
in
the
yeast
department
just
a
true
wild
here
funky
as
heck
but
the
raspberries
dominate
tart
and
sweet
fresh
and
ripe
young
and
mature
elements
both
present
dynamic
but
not
as
complex
as
some
the
flavor
just
drips
fresh
raspberries
a
fruit
i
really
love
in
beer
when
its
done
right
leagues
below
stuff
like
atrial
rubicite
in
both
brett
and
fruit
character
but
its
like
a
kid
brother
to
a
beer
like
that
beautifully
done
i
wish
for
only
richer
body
a
little
more
heft
and
maybe
some
more
bacterial
kick
but
i
thinks
this
is
one
if
the
best
of
the
sisters
and
shows
that
goose
island
is
still
a
very
relevant
player
in
the
beer
scene
despite
being
macro
in
many
ways
beer
this
good
from
a
brewery
this
big
should
cost
less
though
and
ill
bet
if
sierra
nevada
made
it
it
would
cost
ten
bucks
thats
my
only
real
problem
with
an
otherwise
very
enjoyable
and
fun
wild
ale
nevermind
that
its
not
the
most
unique
framboise
lambic
type
out
there
its
delicious
and
thats
what
matters
shockingly
high
alcohol
though
for
its
taste
and
drinkability
wowza
i
was
really
hoping
for
quite
a
bit
more
sourness
has
a
decent
tartness
but
really
lacking
that
palate
coating
acidity
i
love
in
my
sours
raspberry
and
wine
barrel
flavors
are
done
nicely
though
o
amazingly
complex
beer
a
must
try
for
anyone
that
enjoys
the
sour
styles
the
aroma
is
amazing
tart
red
raspberries
wife
says
strawberry
nice
barnyard
mild
oakiness
a
very
light
and
playful
aroma
a
nice
tart
start
that
explodes
with
a
nice
raspberry
fruity
flavor
and
a
very
nice
farmhouse
haybarnyard
flavor
finishes
with
a
nice
oakybitterness
this
may
well
be
the
best
gi
brew
ive
had
and
it
is
very
hard
to
beat
the
bourbon
county
barleywine
stout
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
an
excellent
sour
ale
with
plenty
of
sour
punch
without
overpowering
the
delicate
fruit
flavors
of
the
beer
certainly
a
worthy
beer
to
christen
a
new
house
with
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
sour
what
i
want
from
sour
tart
smooth
drinkable
this
will
not
be
my
last
bottle
of
lolita
the
beer
pours
a
fizzy
and
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
immediately
the
beer
itself
is
a
hazy
ruby
with
a
hint
of
cherry
red
the
smell
has
a
strong
raspberry
note
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
notes
from
the
barrels
there
also
appears
to
be
a
very
weak
oak
note
as
well
the
smell
also
has
bits
of
fruity
sweetness
to
it
the
beer
taste
is
radically
different
from
the
smell
the
taste
has
a
very
strong
raspberry
note
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
but
barely
the
taste
also
has
a
red
grape
flavor
similar
to
a
cabernet
the
funk
is
in
the
form
of
a
strong
tart
and
sour
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
a
bit
light
and
watery
with
biting
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
and
a
decent
sour
worth
getting
at
least
once
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
on
special
at
butlers
for
14
great
price
decent
looking
beer
with
a
great
smell
had
not
looked
at
it
and
did
not
realize
it
was
a
sour
until
i
caught
a
whiff
not
as
tart
as
some
sours
i
have
had
which
i
like
but
it
was
wonderful
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
and
will
certainly
be
going
back
to
see
if
i
can
snag
a
few
more
while
they
are
on
special
o
a
really
great
sour
ale
nicely
balanced
and
very
flavorful
i
was
a
little
worried
from
the
aroma
that
it
would
be
too
sour
but
its
a
great
balance
o
fantastic
wild
ale
with
plenty
of
tart
fruits
like
raspberries
strawberries
and
cranberries
nice
wine
character
and
feel
excellent
this
beer
drinks
like
a
flavorful
wine
theres
a
lot
going
on
but
it
isnt
merely
fruity
its
complex
im
not
a
big
fan
of
fruity
beers
but
the
way
this
beer
changes
on
the
tongue
and
the
shift
from
sweet
to
sour
make
it
a
solid
beer
not
necessarily
for
the
novice
beer
drinker
tart
medium
bodied
with
not
much
carbonation
to
speak
of
finishes
dry
no
residual
sweetness
the
acidity
cuts
through
the
fruit
doesnt
come
off
at
8
funk
and
oak
come
though
with
some
nots
from
the
barrel
really
pleased
by
the
overall
character
just
an
excellent
sipper
that
comes
off
as
a
crowd
pleaser
o
three
years
in
the
sweetness
appears
to
have
been
pretty
thoroughly
gobbled
by
the
yeast
the
result
is
a
pungent
sour
beer
but
one
with
several
layers
working
simultaneously
the
wine
elements
are
interesting
and
the
hints
of
fruit
give
a
counterpoint
to
the
acidic
bight
that
makes
the
beers
core
a
fine
offering
o
overall
a
very
nice
wildsour
flair
but
remains
very
manageable
for
those
new
to
style
or
who
dont
like
things
overblown
this
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sourness
and
eloquent
feel
that
it
can
easily
substitute
as
a
wine
at
a
fine
dinner
party
very
well
brewed
with
a
soothing
sourness
factor
makes
this
an
easy
try
and
easy
a
beer
for
me
overall
really
good
beer
with
glimmers
of
greatness
sourheads
might
find
it
to
be
a
little
weak
but
i
like
this
level
of
tartness
plus
theres
enough
of
the
funk
to
keep
me
interested
worth
a
try
but
its
understandable
if
you
dont
want
to
pay
20
bucks
for
this
i
wouldnt
do
it
again
i
like
it
could
use
more
depth
and
refinement
pours
oddly
clear
amber
in
hue
nose
is
super
sour
whew
vinegar
lactic
tones
all
very
sharp
flavor
is
just
wads
of
wildness
in
your
mouth
more
so
a
punch
than
any
real
grace
or
character
showing
i
dont
get
much
fruit
barely
an
accent
but
hey
its
wild
and
sour
wont
go
down
as
the
most
graceful
wild
ale
of
them
all
but
i
can
live
with
this
fruity
beer
for
sour
initiated
with
great
complexity
o
great
beer
great
book
great
night
highly
recommended
but
perhaps
overpriced
o
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
some
sours
are
sippers
this
one
is
a
drinker
o
a
remarkably
refreshing
beer
which
could
have
been
improved
if
it
tasted
a
little
weirderfunkier
this
beer
is
a
little
simplistic
pretty
straightforward
in
terms
of
its
flavour
profiles
and
the
first
sip
yields
much
the
same
flavours
as
the
finish
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
this
beer
would
be
awesome
with
some
age
on
it
i
may
just
have
to
find
out
765

that

alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a

present
after

overall
this
is
a

all
around

and
very

crisp
to

on
for

abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
impressive
wild
ale
rivals
other
great
sour
raspberry
wilds
the
wine
barrel
offers
great
character
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
so
far
it
is
so
complex
and
full
bodied
hopefully
its
the
same
in
the
bottle
o
a
very
nice
sour
that
balances
earthiness
funkiness
and
fruitiness
extremely
well
could
be
my
favorite
out
of
lolita
juliet
and
halia
an
excellent
sour
redolent
of
raspberries
and
with
enough
bite
to
be
very
interesting
but
not
so
much
as
to
destroy
the
tastebuds
the
pour
itself
is
beautiful
with
the
raspberries
lending
a
ruby
hue
to
the
base
brown
color
little
head
raspberries
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
fairly
sharp
sourness
the
taste
is
even
better
with
a
rounder
profile
a
bare
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
clear
fresh
fruit
note
along
with
the
somewhat
bracing
acidity
very
nicely
done
indeed
pours
out
a
hazy
rust
color
with
hardly
any
head
smells
funky
and
acidic
with
a
touch
of
raspberry
and
vanilla
flavor
starts
off
sweetish
with
some
dryness
and
tartness
coming
through
the
middle
raspberry
is
tastefully
done
and
subdued
a
bit
too
much
oak
for
me
the
vanilla
is
a
little
overpowering
light
acidity
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
could
use
some
more
fizz
to
combat
the
richness
of
the
wood
this
is
tasty
but
id
have
a
hard
time
drinking
more
than
a
glass
of
this
overall
my
first
ever
sour
maybe
my
last
goose
island
is
my
favorite
brewery
but
this
simply
does
not
work
for
me
a
topnotch
wild
from
goose
island
a
must
try
the
flavor
is
both
sour
and
slightly
sweet
with
raspberry
with
red
wine
tartness
and
light
sweet
edge
of
fruit
with
fresh
tart
berry
flavors
adding
to
the
acidity
of
lactic
acid
and
yeast
which
compliments
the
light
oak
in
the
background
overall
very
nice
sour
ale
with
flavor
of
raspberry
but
not
over
the
top
fruit
drinkable
with
a
kiss
of
raspberry
t
big
underripe
raspberry
tartness
upfront
meaty
sour
cherry
big
pinot
noir
notes
and
some
lighter
white
wine
notes
as
it
winds
down
into
the
finish
finish
is
lemony
tart
and
slightly
acetic
with
a
light
tannic
dryness
that
rounds
things
out
pretty
nicely
overall
very
tasty
i
want
to
drink
this
cold
in
a
hot
humid
environment
packaging
gets
a
five
here
and
enhances
the
experience
a
nice
bottle
to
share
or
enjoy
alone
on
a
sunday
afternoon
like
i
just
have
lolita
is
delicious
osolid
sour
with
decent
flavor
not
as
wellbalanced
as
some
other
examples
o
this
and
juliet
was
my
favorite
of
the
sisters
reminds
me
of
a
classic
flanders
red
i
would
drink
this
one
over
and
over
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
american
wild
ale
it
had
a
nice
sour
base
to
it
that
wasnt
overly
sour
or
acidic
and
the
raspberry
worked
well
with
this
beer
and
the
all
the
flavors
seem
to
come
together
nicely
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
a
little
acidic
dry
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
very
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
the
acidic
aspect
would
keep
me
from
drinking
the
whole
bottle
but
i
think
half
the
bottle
is
pretty
close
to
the
prefect
amount
for
me
and
i
think
this
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
summertime
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
well
the
raspberry
worked
with
the
sour
base
they
complemented
each
other
nicely
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
is
nothing
there
is
anything
that
i
would
change
its
great
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
saw
it
its
pretty
pricey
at
20
but
i
think
its
worth
it
and
its
a
nice
special
occasion
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
american
wild
ales
or
sour
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
decided
to
go
half
on
a
bottle
with
my
friend
i
wouldnt
want
to
miss
out
on
this
one
and
the
more
beers
i
have
from
this
series
the
more
i
like
it
juliet
is
still
my
favorite
but
this
one
comes
in
a
solid
second
great
job
guys
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
and
i
hope
i
can
try
the
rest
of
the
sisters
keep
up
the
great
work
maybe
my
favorite
of
the
belgian
sisters
i
am
really
glad
to
see
this
in
texas
while
it
is
on
the
expensive
side
still
cheaper
than
the
others
sitting
around
and
a
better
product
imo
highly
recommended
lovely
glowing
pinkishred
orangy
color
with
a
quickly
fading
white
head
no
lace
no
more
head
but
a
very
nice
color
clear
enough
to
see
a
stream
of
carbonation
bubbles
rising
at
the
center
of

aroma

with
a
dusting
of
wackiness
juicy
tart
raspberries
wild
yeast
white
doughy
crackers
warm
summer
floral
and
some
soft
musky
wood
taste
is
similar
but
includes
increased
tart
funkiness
really
nice
actually
very
fun
to
drink
flavors
are
sweet
and
sour

tangy
and
tart
woody
and

white

smooth

a

liquid
with
a
low
white

that
promptly
crackles
away
to
nothing
potent
acetic
aroma
dry
funky
raspberries
mustiness
and
dry
wood
sweetish
tart
raspberry
slickness
in
the
mouth
dry
winelike
fruit
dust
lemon
earth
and
sharp
woody
notes
a
bit
phenolic
in
the
finish
which
meshes
with
the
spicy
wood
the
extremely
dry
acidic
smell
is
a
little
harsh
but
the
berries
really
come
out
in
the
flavor
super
dry
and
puckering
mouthfeel
lightly
carbonated
very
refreshing
and
surprisingly
refreshing
for
its
strength
cheers
all
of
the
4
sisters
beers
are
pretty
solid
lolita
is
lively
and
tart
from
the
aggressive
addition
of
raspberries
some
wood
and
vinous
notes
come
through
from
the
cab
sauv
barrels
but
those
traits
are
not
overly
assertive
bubbly
carbonation
good
stuff
just
wish
it
was
more
around
the
15
price
point
i
wasnt
sure
i
liked
this
one
at
first
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
nice
sour
tart
acidity
get
some
raspberry
and
get
a
nice
oak
flavor
the
smell
kinda
throws
you
off
a
bit
though
kinda
get
like
a
hair
or
nail
salon
type
of
smell
to
it
if
that
makes
any
sense
but
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
dont
know
if
its
worth
the
22
price
tag
though
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
a
decent
sour
but
probably
not
worth
the
high
price
tag
lacks
refinement
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
burnt
orangegarnet
with
no
sediment
or
head
the
nose
is
quite
unique
with
ripe
raspberries
nail
salon
and
dog
saliva
id
say
the
taste
is
a
more
modest
raspberrydriven
funky
sour
comparable
to
a
tart
oaky
white
zinfandel
in
flavor
and
body
its
relatively
undercarbonated
vinous
tart
tannic
semidry
fruity
and
a
slightly
funky
sour
but
it
hides
alcohol
well
and
is
quite
drinkable
this
is
definitely
not
a
disappointment
but
the
price
point
on
the
bottle
is
poured
from
750
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
purchased
locally
at
specs
tasted
on
1314
poured
into
wide
champagne
flute
slightly
hazy
peachy
amber
color
with
tons
of
bubbly
whitish
pink
head
that
faded
immediately
some
bubbles
cling
to
the
side
of
the
glass
within
the
beer
aroma
is
of
sweet
raspberry
and
dry
woody
wine
taste
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
aroma
quite
sweet
decent
but
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beer
high
carbonation
makes
this
fun
to
drink
i
enjoy
the
bubbly
feeling
body
is
light
borderline
thin
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
price
was
around
18
but
worth
it
just
do
not
feel
this
beer
is
good
enough
to
warrant
the
demand
and
price
tag
i
will
definitely
pass
if
this
beer
or
any
of
the
other
sisters
cross
my
pass
this
in
my
opinion
the
best
of
the
groupl
a
nice
beer
but
i
would
need
to
give
serious
consideration
to
pull
the
trigger
again
at
20
a
bottle
overall
this
might
be
the
most
enjoyable
of
the
few
dozen
or
so
wild
ales
ive
had
the
sourness
is
moderate
and
integrates
well
with
the
fruit
elements
really
pleasant
to
drink
and
a
nice
intro
to
the
style
if
you
are
so
inclined
i
poured
them
from
a
25oz
bottle
this
beer
has
a
blush
colored
body
with
no
head
the
aroma
has
a
tart
raspberry
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
tart
raspberry
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
smooth
and
overall
this
is
excellent
beer
i
hope
i
can
get
a
hold
of
the
other
sisters
o
another
solid
offering
from
goose
island
you
simply
cant
go
wrong
drinking
their
barrel
aged
and
belgian
offerings
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
atmosphere
is
nice
no
real
head
or
lacing
but
a
nice
ruby
amber
hue
nose
is
yeast
and
raspberry
flavor
follows
suit
fruity
lightly
bittersweet
pristine
and
so
subdued
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
2013
vintage
oi
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
had
perhaps
set
my
expectations
a
bit
too
high
the
funky
lactic
raspberry
flavors
are
nice
but
simple
when
compared
against
better
more
complex
examples
of
the
style
i
could
have
used
more
oak
in
the
flavor
profile
and
a
more
robust
body
to
tamp
down
the
high
levels
of
acidity
all
in
all
it
is
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
purchased
at
total
wine
in
naples
fl
for
18
99
for
the
765
ml
bottle
d
a
surprisingly
good
brew
the
tart
raspberry
note
is
superb
very
sessionable
even
with
an
8
7
abv
sadly
two
years
later
i
did
and
i
still
feel
the
same
way
really
making
me
regret
such
a
purchase
overall
a
really
good
sourwild
ale
big
taste
of
funky
yeast
and
red
wine
fruits
reddish
brown
with
a
small
head
a
spectacular
aroma
of
stone
fruit
dry
caramel
and
balsamic
vinegar
the
flavor
follows
along
the
same
lines
but
without
the
same
level
of
transcendence
nicely
done
one
of
the
best
smelling
sours
ive
had
in
a
long
time
minimal
head
on
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
brown
body
no
lacing
really
aroma
of
strawberry
cherry
wood
vinegar
nicely
tart
and
sweet
flavors
of
strawberry
tartness
with
hints
of
raspberry
and
background
notes
of
molasses
and
wood
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
excellent
balanced
but
simple
sour
definitely
should
be
tried

overall
gi
fails

yet
again
great
beer
highly
recommend
it
taste
is
raspberry
up
front
followed
by
tart
funk
and
finally
vinegar
lolitas
a
great
sour
thats
nicely
balanced
between
sourness
and
fruitiness
highly
recommended
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
2013
prickly
spicypeppery
raspberries
with
a
cleansing
tartness
the
funk
is
subtle
and
i
pick
out
red
wine
and
barrel
taste
from
the
aging
it
really
is
subdued
but
backs
up
the
fruit
and
tartness
wonderfully
it
bears
a
beautiful
dark
rose
color
with
thin
lacing
as
well
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
of
this
series
from
goose
island
o
this
is
a
decent
sour
though
one
dimensional
sorry
this
beer
was
nasty
in
my
opinion
it
was
thin
and
watery
looking
no
head
at
all
the
taste
was
like
robotussin
but
slightly
less
mediciney
i
cant
really
describe
the
smell
other
than
robotussin
light
not
sure
if
i
got
a
glass
from
a
bad
keg
or
what
but
this
was
very
disappointing
poured
a
light
reddish
body
with
minimal
head
and
lace
patches
that
die
off
real
quick
aroma
packs
a
razzy
punch
but
a
good
amount
of
tart
sour
funkiness
is
tucked
in
there
and
there
also
some
woody
and
boozy
notes
as
well
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
a
highly
caarbonated
sharp
beer
that
is
light
to
medium
bodied
passes
over
my
tongue
with
raspberry
flavor
as
well
as
possible
other
wine
fruits
like
grape
and
theres
a
boozy
oakiness
to
the
beer
as
well
the
barrelwoodiness
helps
keeps
things
balanced
and
smooth
and
i
swear
as
the
beer
warms
or
the
abv
hits
you
depending
on
how
you
look
at
it
there
are
some
minor
sweetnotes
on
the
backend
a
good
sour
ale
that
is
worth
trying
and
enjoyable
the
whole
night
overall
very
delicious
beer
well
balanced
and
delicious
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
the
flavor
isnt
as
full
as
it
could
be
not
sure
how
to
articulate
it
well
done
bb
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
gi
really
reminds
me
of
a
funkier
version
of
rr
supplication
i
wonder
what
some
age
would
do
on
this
thing
either
way
i
recommend
sweettart
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
to
drink
the
only
drawback
for
me
was
the
price
17
for
the
bottle
seemed
a
little
steep
oit
was
good
but
way
over
priced
would
never
buy
a
2nd
bottle
of
this
and
i
love
this
style
ng
raspberry
tart
at
half
the
price
was
so
much
better
its
recommended
but
a
bit
harder
to
swallow
at
18750ml
gi
could
keep
working
on
the
recipe
and
round
this
one
up
a
notch
and
get
it
to
the
must
have
level
lighter
body
light
effervescence
cloying
not
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
for
certain
decent
is
it
im
not
the
greatest
with
rating
these
types
as
theyre
so
winelike
but
i
like
this
one
i
need
to
try
a
fresh
one
to
see
how
this
aged
overall
really
good
raspberry
sour
big
fruit
oak
and
tartness
with
just
enough
funk
of
the
3
goose
island
sisters
ive
tried
the
other
2
being
juliet
and
madame
rose
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
goose
island
lolita
45
35
a
very
well
done
beer
with
a
good
amout
of
tartness
and
a
good
amount
raspberry
a
good
beer
for
fruit
beer
or
wild
ale
lovers
rosé
de
gambrinus
this
beer
is
not
the
18
asking
price
is
outrageous
nice
to
try
and
to
savor
with
some
food
but
it
really
is
nowhere
near
what
a
good
framboise
should
be
if
you
make
the
case
that
this
isnt
supposed
to
be
a
framboise
well
it
says
something
to
the
effect
on
the
label
too
much
barrel
a
bit
too
much
booziness
and
not
enough
fruit
its
not
complex
when
its
chilled
but
it
gets
boozy
when
it
gets
warm
cant
really
win
with
this
one
o
a
very
nice
american
sour
with
a
good
mix
between
the
raspberries
oak
and
wine
character
quite
drinkable
for
a
sour
but
its
nice
to
sit
back
and
relax
and
just
sip
it
priced
right
around
the
average
for
other
sours
as
far
as
750
ml
bottles
go
at
18
so
its
really
not
too
bad
of
a
deal
either
great
if
you
like
raspberries
too
overall
outstanding
well
worth
buying
again
glad
that
i
have
23
more
bottles
this
is
a
beer
thats
well
worth
your
attention
if
you
like
sour
beers
also
had
tasted
the
2010
vintage
a
week
ago
at
beervana
ri
and
it
was
even
better
and
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
night
curious
to
taste
last
years
and
thus
years
i
would
say
the
10
was
slightly
more
tart
less
sweet
of
a
raspberry
flavor
and
a
smidge
nicer
body
o
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
domestic
sours
tart
as
heck
and
just
as
smooth
a
great
fruit
and
oak
balance
i
always
have
one
of
these
in
my
cellar
and
fridge
certainly
worth
the
price
tag
i
highly
recommend
this
ale
overall
a
very
enjoyable
american
sour
odmaybe
my
palate
was
a
bit
burnt
out
at
this
point
but
this
one
didnt
impress
me
too
much
i
will
probably
revisit
this
beer
still
it
was
pretty
decent

some

very
enjoyable
i
was
salivating
from
start
to
finish
from
the
pungently
tart
aroma
and
the
flavor
definitely
helped
to
quench
my
senses
a
very
nice
sour
brew
from
goose
island
with
plenty
of
fruitiness
that
never
really
comes
off
as
sweet
rather
it
remains
mostly
tart
and
juicy
for
the
entire
duration
of
the
beer
barrel
was
heavy
yet
subtle
enough
to
let
the
fruit
work
its
magic
great
beer
all
around
overall
a
fine
fruited
sour
beer
with
plenty
of
tasty
brett

notes
with
well
balanced

notes
with
some
subtle
notes
of
brett
at
the
end
body
is
about

with
great
carbonation
which
feels
right
for
the
style
and
no
apparent

very
good
level
of
drinkability
with
well
balanced
complexity
i
would
love
to
have
a
lower
abv
version
of
this
that
could
be
drank
in
the
summertime
pink
brown
with
little
central
etching
smells
like

3
5
d
tasty
beer
that
is
good
enough
all
around
ive
yet
to
be
impressed
by
a
gi
sour
but
im
never
too
disappointed
light
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
has
a
dry
finish
and
a
tart
raspberry
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
well
disguised
for
9
00
abv
very
nicely
made
o
comparitvely
speaking
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
3
sisters
but
its
still
a
nice
sour
not
much
for
complexity
but
it
i
enjoy
the
balacne
of
the
tartness
and
the
wine
characters
d
overall
i
wasnt
necessarily
blown
away
by
this
at
the
same
time
i
wasnt
disappointed
it
is
a
well
crafted
american
wild
ale
however
i
prefer
mine
to
have
a
touch
more
of
the
citric
lambic
sourness
to
interplay
with
fruits
overall
a
nice
wild
ale
but
not
the
best
ive
had
the
raspberries
add
some
interesting
flavors
but
they
feel
faded
and
not
as
bright
as
i
expected
not
overly
tart
at
all
but
pretty
complex
and
tasty
nice
tangy
dryish
and
balanced
overall
good
fruit
character
but
i
want
more
beer
not
as
good
as
juliet
i
have
had
this
beer
on
a
couple
of
occasions
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
sat
down
with
it
with
the
intention
of
recording
my
impressions
i
find
that
despite
the
acidity
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
would
rate
it
higher
if
i
could
detect
just
a
bit
more
of
a
contribution
from
the
raspberries
moreover
i
believe
the
acidity
thats
present
is
more
than
enough
to
support
just
a
tad
more
sweetness
at
any
rate
am
hoping
i
can
soon
try
other
sour
offerings
from
goose
island
like
juliet
and
madame
rose
notes
this
is
rather
nice
but
for
me
and
in
this
incarnation
it
does
suffer
from
quite
a
bit
of
hype
if
only
the
promise
of
that
aroma
had
stood
up
the
palate
opens
sharp
lactic
and
bretty
with
clove
and
plastic
a
little
harsh
and
unpleasant
nice
raspberry
fruit
mildly
seedy
and
moderately
tannic
drying
on
the
finish
with
flavors
of
fruit
oak
and
tannins
this
is
decent
stuff
m
moderate
carbonation
like
you
would
expect
kind
of
an
odd
dry
feeling
almost
as
if
it
were
slightly
powdery
a
very
sessionable
weight
and
not
too
tart
to
drink
all
night
a
solid
sour
from
gi
o
this
is
very
good
i
just
wish
it
was
more
sour
o
certainly
a
good
beer
not
the
best
wild
ale
ive
ever
come
across
but
not
the
worst
either
o
cherry
and
tart
subtle
and
nice
great
beer
o
overall
im
very
fond
of
this
beer
lots
of
raspberries
with
a
hint
of
sour
tartness
some
wine
like
flavors
and
feel
excellent
very
good
beer
probably
behind
juliet
but
ahead
of
madame
rose
for
me
very
acidic
and
dry
though
i
enjoyed
it
but
needed
a
zantac
afterwards
lots
of
raspberry
in
this
one
thanks
americo
pink
coloured

fruity
aroma
fuller
mouthfeel
also
with
assertive
carbonation
a
good
tartness
a
nice
bottle
to
share
because
of
the
acidity
some
other
berries
there
lending
balance
strawberry
and
some
wild
blueberry
could
even
be
some
cherry
0fandamntastic
worth
the
jackson
it
costs
to
buy
this
bottle
excellent
in
any
season
and
environment
this
perfectly
exemplifies
the
potential
of
shortterm
cellaring
the
sour
patch
kid
punch
that
sort
of
turns
me
off
from
fresh
lolita
has
subsided
to
a
mellow
dry
complex
fruit
profile
very
nice

a

color
with
a
moderate
head
that
leaves
great
lacing
mild
scent
of
raspberries
wine
and

some
of
the
taste
reminded
me
of
olive
juice
taste
was
smooth
and
mellow
with
raspberries
wheats
and
yeast
rich
creamy
and
very
delicious
o
a
clean
and
easy
drinking
sour
beer
great

flavors
without
being
so
over

to
prevent

thanks
again
jay
overall
lolita
light
of
my
life
fire
of
my
loins
my
sin
my
soul
loleeta
the
tip
of
the
tongue
taking
a
trip
of
three
steps
down
the
palate
to
tap
at
three
on
the
teeth
lo
lee
ta
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
body
with
rather
light
carbonation
lingering
tart
fruity
finish
a
little
on
the
acidic
side
and
not
quite
as
good
as
juliet
tart
but
not
overly
sour
would
like
to
see
how
this
one
ages
m
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
id
have
preferred
had
it
been
fruit
forward
not
really
a
fan
of
the
wine
barrels
lolita
comes
out
looking
the
part
with
a
dark
red
deep
amber
look
coming
from
the
glass
this
is
much
darker
than
expected
going
into
blackberry
color
right
off
the
tap
there
was
nothing
in
terms
of
head
of
even
a
flimsy
foam
nothing
its
all
good
though
smell
is
pretty
integrated
with
raspberry
scent
over
faint
wine
coming
through
when
the
warming
takes
place
its
pretty
tame
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
dont
get
any
funky
scents
coming
up
just
mainly
fruit
taste
is
pretty
one
sided
towards
the
raspberry
flavor
which
is
nice
and
not
artificial
the
fruit
just
does
not
pop
out
for
me
as
much
as
i
would
like
the
wine
is
light
to
and
the
barrel
flavor
non
existent
some
malt
presence
in
the
end
with
a
slight
tart
hit
that
is
not
sour
dont
go
looking
for
a
pucker
bomb
lolita
is
not
the
one
for
that
body
is
less
than
medium
with
a
trace
of
carb
nice
stuff
but
not
something
i
will
be
going
for
again
with
so
much
tart
fruitiness
and
dry
sweetness
this
beer
is
ideally
suited
to
win
over
lovers
of
all
sorts
of
wines
and
i
find
notes
of
minerally
greek
whites
robust
chilean
merlots
and
simplified
white
zinfindales
sprinkled
all
over
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
subtle
prickliness
and
modest
carbonation
very
nice
overall
o
a
solid
beer
and
worth
the
price
tag
but
not
as
good
as
juliet
good
sour
qualities
but
i
feel
that
it
would
have
been
if
the
raspberries
added
more
sourness
and
werent
so
sweet
and
tart
o
if
it
didnt
feel
like
a
watery
soda
id
be
going
back
for
a
second
bottle
it
does
though
and
the
palate
is
distracted
by
it
in
the
end
still
its
a
tasty
brew
especially
if
you
like
wine
o
definitely
a
good
sour
beer
someone
getting
used
to
sours
me
great
smells
looks
inviting
i
like
the
tingle
of
carbonation
and
the
complexities
going
on
hard
for
me
to
spell
out
as
my
palate
is
still
developing
when
it
comes
to
fruitsours
id
give
a
4
25
overall
bottled
on
111211
so
maybe
i
should
have
given
it
more
time
but
its
only
barely
drinkable
and
just
beerlike
theres
an
alcohol
heat
but
not
much
taste
not
my
favorite
o
a
very
solid
beer
although
id
like
to
see
it
a
touch
lighter
in
the
body
and
the
nose
wasnt
near
as
complex
as
the
taste
would
like
to
have
again
very
nice
overall
a
good
sour
with
lots
of
raspberry
flavor
but
lacking
somewhat
in
complexity
id
rather
have
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
notes
light
but
alcohol
is
definitely
present
for
folks
that
love
sours
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
trying
not
the
greatest
on
earth
but
still
solid
lacks
a
bit
in
appearance
but
stands
out
in
nose
and
flavor
considering
the
price
i
would
probably
choose
others
first
but
nonetheless
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
real
good
wild
ale
is
definitely
sour
right
now
and
this
was
a
2012
bottling
pretty
nice
beer
and
one
that
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
and
seemed
to
open
up
in
the
glass
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
complex
and
as
noted
above
there
really
is
a
considerable
amount
of
flavor
in
this
beer
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
this
again
any
time
soon
but
am
still
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
bottle
price
in
my
part
of
the
world
was
20
so
obviously
thats
a
consideration
as
well
2011
vintage
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
reddish
gold
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
tart
fruit
oak
and
a
little
brett
in
the
aroma
tart
raspberries
to
start
and
a
long
finish
of
oak
and
vanilla
medium
bodied
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
not
super
sour
but
a
nice
acetic
bite
that
was
in
balance
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
a
pricey
bottle
but
im
really
glad
that
i
pulled
the
trigger
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
raspberry
presence
that
never
becomes
overly
sweet
or
dominating
funky
earthy
bugs
and
wine
barrel
character
provide
nice
balance
dry
toasted
oak
along
with
grape
currant
and
other
dark
berries
nice
tartness
with
a
puckering
feel
and
just
a
touch
of
acetic
acid
not
harsh
at
all
however
with
the
sweetness
keeping
things
in
check
pretty
good
and
much
better
than
the
madame
rose
a
really
really
tasty
sour
reminds
me
a
lot
of
rr
supplication
a
fruity
sour
with
an
excellent
balance
between
those
two
lighter
to
medium
body
lower
carbonation
a
slight
alcohol
burn
but
not
overwhelming
fantastic
character
added
by
the
barrel
here
i
imagine
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
could
make
this
a
classic
very
nice
the
beer
is
copper
to
amber
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
sparse
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
raspberries
berries
malt
wild
yeast
smells
like
a
tasty
american
wild
ale
the
flavor
is
pleasant
not
remarkably
funky
or
sour
but
rather
easy
to
drink
light
in
body
but
not
thin
raspberries
and
oak
are
the
dominant
flavors
i
thought
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
brew
and
would
happily
have
it
again
o
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
gi
wild
ale
gets
much
better
as
it
sits
around
and
warms
especially
on
the
nose
where
it
really
opens
up
and
comes
alive
unless
i
figure
out
something
to
cook
and
showcase
this
brew
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
glad
i
finally
tried
it
but
wasnt
really
impressed
nothing
wrong
with
it
to
speak
of
but
very
underwhelming
overall
pretty
good
would
be
far
better
with
more
carbonation
o
too
sour
and
dry
for
my
liking
could
use
more
sweetness
and
carbonation
overall
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
i
like
sours
but
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
i
have
always
wanted
to
try
this
particular
brew
and
was
lucky
enough
to
find
one
im
glad
i
didnt
let
this
sit
in
the
cellar
much
longer
six
months
in
the
bottle
seems
to
be
perfect
just
enough
for
the
brett
to
do
its
thing
but
keep
the
raspberries
at
the
forefront
recommended
highly
to
any
ba
who
can
get
their
hands
on
it
cheers
o
after
having
it
a
few
times
the
taste
is
just
not
quite
there
not
sure
what
its
missing
it
was
good
not
fantastic
this
is
a
great
beer
but
it
is
not
exceptional
there
are
some
great
fruit
flavors
some
nice
sourness
and
a
nice
balance
of
tartness
but
its
not
remarkably
complex
overall
its
a
beer
that
has
some
issues
mainly
with
carbonation
but
the
flavor
is
delicious
and
very
well
balanced
with
excellent
barrel
notes
does
not
taste
at
all
like
9
abv
overall
certainly
not
one
of
the
most
mouth
puckering
wild
ales
out
there
but
i
am
not
sure
why
so
many
think
that
is
a
bad
thing
this
is
actually
well
balanced
from
all
the
components
and
i
love
the
winelike
character
it
has
plus
this
is
much
more
refreshing
than
any
red
wine
o
this
is
a
home
run
in
my
books
its
not
an
over
the
top
cantillon
sour
that
the
masses
would
wince
at
its
easy
drinking
palatable
to
most
and
just
an
overall
wonderful
experience
o
nice
sour
beer
o
overall
this
was
a
very
unimpressive
and
underwhelming
beer
i
love
sours
but
this
this
just
isnt
sour
far
too
malty
for
my
liking
glad
i
didnt
buy
it
thanks
to
my
cousin
jeff
for
sharing
it
pours
a
reddish
copper

the
aroma
is

of

some
hay
big
sweet
rasberry
notes
slight

finish
it
is
more
tart
than
sour
the

very
vinous
a

lolita
is
a
really
nice
release
from
goose
island
i
was
apprehensive
once
i
saw
that
raspberry
was
used
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
positive
the
fruit
flavor
is
nice
and
subtle
works
really
well
with
the
other
flavors
this
is
really
good
stuff
its
pricey

up

not

this
was
another
solid
beer
from
gi
although
this
might
have
been
my
least
favorite
of
the
3
sisters
overall
solid
but
not
quite
of
the
caliber
i
was
expecting
the
flavors
war
with
one
another
at
the
start
but
eventually
settle
down
a
bit
of
time
might
temper
it
and
really
let
the
flavors
meld
and
create
something
great
i
found
this
beer
very
similar
to
ommegangs
aphroditea
little
too
fruitforward
for
me
the
barrel
characteristics
at
least
in
this
fresh
bottle
are
minimal
for
a
great
goose
island
sour
offering
go
for
madame
rose
instead
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
somehow
not
great
it
is
more
tart
than
it
is
sour
in
my
opinion
i
live
close
to
jolly
pumpkin
and
go
there
often
if
their
beers
werent
so
well
done
i
might
have
a
slightly
higher
opinion
of
lolita
drink
the
2nd
of
the
3
sisters
has
again
lived
up
to
the
hype
a
great
american
wild

often
misdone

want

into
a
goose
island
wine
glass
poured
a
deep
redorange
with

decent

throughout
the

the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
raspberries
tart
cherry
tart
cherries
wood
and
acetic
acid
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
tart
cherry
fruit
vinegar
wood
earth
sour
and
subtle
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
fruit
profile
going
on
here
was
really
nice
with
a
nice
sour
and
tart
aspect
carrying
through
this
made
for
a
really
nice
brew
that
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
honestly
wish
i
had
a
lot
more
of
this
as
it
was
quite
nice
a
definite
must
try
if
you
like
sours
2011
vintage
o
i
had
this
side
by
side
with
the
2011
vintage
this
beer
is
much
more
subdued
that
its
2011
sister
light
caramel
malts
give
a
good
base
for
both
beers
but
this
one
ends
up
being
sweeter
it
is
a
little
bit
less
in
your
face
than
the
2011
also
this
has
more
carbonation
which
makes
it
that
much
more
enjoyable
45
othis
is
considered
one
of
their
sours
but
i
prefer
the
tart
beers
like
fleur
and
matilda
to
this
one
nice
american
wild
good
but
a
little
simple
o
welldone
the
raspberries
were
certainly
perceivable
and
enjoyable
and
the
sourness
balanced
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
profile
with
the
alcohol
being
extremely
wellhidden
not
quite
worth
the
18
i
paid
for
it
but
highly
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
a
nice
sour
not
as
good
as
i
would
have
hoped
for
the
price
but
a
solid
barrel
aged
sour
pours
dark
pinkred
aroma
is
raspberries
the
taste
is
sour
raspberry
and
merlot
very
astringent
its
not
as
bitter
as
one
would
assume
the
tartness
is
well
balanced
by
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
but
worth
a
try
o
glad
to
have
tried
it
for
the
price
i
will
not
revisit
not
bad
but
nothing
standout
forme
thanks
to
gi
for
putting
the
time
in
to
making
sours
this
is
a
translucent
red
color
with
only
light
carbonation
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
some
apple
and
berry
taste
is
tart
and
sour
with
raspberries
cherries
apple
and
grape
fruit
presence
the
alcohol
is
masked
extremely
well
very
drinkable
not
overwhelmingly
sour
very
drinkable
despite
the
hefty
abv
im
very
happy
that
i
got
to
try
it
very
good
stuff
the
wine
barrel
aging
is
much
more
noticeable
this
big
beer
is
dry
enough
and
has
the
red
wine
characteristics
down
pat
i
would
have
appreciated
a
bigger
nose
and
a
little
more
sweetness
to
offset
the
sour
otherwise
a
fun
beer
to
try
o
wonderful
aroma
boring
taste
i
was
really
expecting
more
from
this
beer
perhaps
it
just
needs
some
age
for
the
brett
to
start
working
up
but
as
a
fresh
wild
ale
it
is
really
tame
cost
16
99
for
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
beer
drinks
a
little
like
an
oude
bruin
but
more
fruity
and
less
sour
mildly
tannic
at
the
back
an
interesting
beer
decent
sour
for
the
collection
i
feel
like
with
a
name
like
lolita
this
beer
shouldnt
be
aged
overall
i
like
it
its
unique
and
complex
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
every
night
but
its
an
interesting
brew
to
have
on
occasion
pours
a
nice
light
orange
color
with
some
pinkish
hues
theres
a
bit
of
a
white
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
a
good
dosing
of
raspberries
plus
a
bit
of
oak
theres
a
good
bit
of
earth
and
moderate
funk
behind
that
as
well
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
strong
and
integrated
but
is
nice
nonetheless
lightmedium
body
with
a
good
bit
of
acidity
through
the
finish
along
with
some
dryness
no
detectable
alcohol
really
nice
overall
this
could
use
a
bit
more
of
everything
raspberries
are
weak
belgian
yeast
character
is
lacking
could
use
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
back
everything
up
or
some
more
malt
influence
ill
lay
one
down
for
a
while
but
i
do
not
have
much
faith
in
this
beer
verdict
very
pleasant
sour
beer
from
goose
island
ive
yet
to
have
a
truly
great
sour
from
them
but
they
are
definitely
on
the
right
track
with
lolita
o
very
unique
beer
definitely
has
some
wine
like
qualities
and
shows
how
versatile
that
beer
can
be
makes
use
of
nice
fruit
flavors
without
being
over
your
face
or
syrup
like
hides
9
very
well
this
is
a
beer
that
reminds
you
that
craft
beer
is
an
art
form
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
goose
island
makes
another
really
nice
beer
its
delicate
and
balanced
sour
beer
with
nice
complexity

pours
almost
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
hint
of
pink
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
immediately
musty
with
a
bit
of

followed
by
tart

lots
of
raspberries
with

sweet

takes
a
bit
for
the
tartness
to
kick
in
some
oak
flavors
with
tart
raspberries
and
red

a
little
bit
of
brett
flavor
with
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
very
fizzy
tart
but
not
puckering
drinkability
is
high
as
it
is
a
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
probably
the
least
complex
and
least
favorite
of
the
three
sisters
of
goose
island
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
not
as
good
as
the
price
point
suggests
though
at
least
they
got
it
to
9
overall
i
am
thinking
this
didnt
really
age
that
well
perhaps
i
missed
it
at
its
prime
thats
the
impression
i
got
but
somehow
i
can
still
enjoy
this
great
looking
beer
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
rose
pink
in
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
quickly
dissipating
off
white
head
the
nose
features
a
touch
of
sweet
raspberry
before
becoming
very
dry
and
offering
aromas
of
oak
aging
and
brett
its
very
belgian
on
the
nose
its
nice
and
features
more
berry
as
it
warms
the
flavors
too
begin
with
soft
fresh
raspberry
sweetness
before
becoming
very
dry
and
tart
i
get
a
good
amount
of
brett
it
has
nice
flavor
and
no
aspect
is
over
the
top
it
drinks
very
light
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
sour
with
intriguing
flavors
if
this
was
cheaper
it
would
be
far
more
appealing
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
much
of
this
at
18
99
nice
beer
though
hopefully
the
other
two
sisters
are
available
here
soon
o
great
american
wild
ale
would
have
liked
the
fruit
to
be
as
forward
in
the
taste
as
the
nose
but
thats
just
me
price
15
95
at
whole
foods
nyc
o
a
really
nice
tasty
beer
very
simple
tasty
and
surprisingly
refreshing
for
9
definitely
a
beer
to
try
o
nice
little
beer
this
lolita
i
dont
know
if
id
pay
16ish
again
for
another
bottle
but
i
wont
be
turning
it
down
if
offered
at
another
tasting
recommended
as
an
entry
level
awa
and
for
those
looking
for
a
little
nuance
with
their
funk
overall
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
not
my
favorite
for
17
99
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
pick
up
this
beer
again
o
well
this
certainly
doesnt
drink
like
a
9
beer
lots
of
interesting
stuff
going
on
im
having
trouble
deciding
if
i
like
the
way
all
of
these
flavors
blend
definitely
unique
for
the
style
and
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
wild
ale
that
takes
on
fruit
characteristics
beyond
whats
normal
goose
island
knows
how
to
take
a
beer
and
a
barrel
and
create
a
bomb
ass
creation
this
is
a
prime
example
didnt
expect
to
see
a
handful
of
these
on
the
shelves
but
when
i
did
i
was
happy
to
pick
a
couple
up
the
beer
is
a
nice
ruby
red
color
sodalike
head
that
recedes
to
nothing
immediately
aroma
has
a
lot
of
nice
funk
with
some
raspberries
and
a
bit
of
acetic
tartness
flavor
has
some
bitterness
raspberry
some
barnyard
funk
but
not
a
lot
more
acetic
an
lactic
sourness
mouthfeel
is
great
dry
nice
high
carbonation
very
refreshing
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
sort
of
surprised
they
got
this
to
9
and
kept
it
so
dry
outstanding
o
surprising
stuff
much
less
of
a
frilly
dessert
beer
than
i
had
initially
expected
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
or
wild
ales
ive
had
in
some
time
hopefully
i
can
find
another
to
age
i
like
it
she
loves
it
o
this
was
a
16
or
17
dollar
bottle
and
absolutely
worth
it
among
the
best
american
attempts
at
a
funky
belgian
that
i
have
encountered
not
quite
a
proper
lambicgeueze
really
but
still
damn
good
captures
many
of
the
desired
wild
characteristics
in
the
best
way
but
in
a
balanced
manner
thoughtful
to
the
last
drop
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
the
tart
sour
raspberries
were
very
good
in
it
a
little
more
funkiness
to
add
some
complexity
would
have
gone
a
long
way
for
me
very
tasty
beer
overall
though

many
thanks
to
pierreluc
and
julien
ale
brewed

raspberries
aged
in

barrels
salmonorange
with
a
white
head
the
nose
is
very
appealling
with
red
wine
pinot
noir
and
strawberry
i
very
like
this
nose
the
taste
is
wonderfull
with
wine
pinot
raspberry
there
is
some
oak
aswell
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
by
its
acidity
one
of
the
best
o
overall
im
impressed
ive
been
hangin
onto
this
one
for
a
while
and
decided
to
pop
it
open
for
a
taste
and
was
pleased
i
did
so
ive
been
trying
more
lately
and
this
one
was
pretty
good
in
my
opinion
heres
to
hoping
this
is
brewed
again
soon
pours
a
light
redpink
with
a
pretty
small
head
and
a
good
mount
of
bubbles
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
strongly
of
tart
raspberry
taste
is
giant
puckering
sour
upfront
which
fades
nicely
to
raspberry
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
pretty
on
par
with
what
i
expect
out
of
a
good
wild
ale
overall
pretty
decent
beer
overall
a
real
decent
wild
ale
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
worse
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
though
o
overall
a
very
good
wild
ale
not
quite
up
to
the
supplication
standard
but
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
nonetheless
nice
light
red
with
touches
of
golden
color
gave
it
a
nice
bright
appearence
tart
grape
skins
cherries
and
loads
of
funk
some
light
spiciness
and
a
decent
touch
of
oak
lots
of
dark
fruit
tart
funkiness
and
a
nice
earthy
woodsy
like
smell
blending
together
very
nicely
on
this
one
silk
like
smoothness
and
the
finest
carbonation
bubbles
really
well
done
in
that
regard
ots
of
sour
in
here
right
up
front
with
frapes
and
light
lemon
like
citrus
taking
over
rolling
through
some
nice
notes
of
cherry
then
came
over
me
decent
funkiness
in
through
the
middle
and
the
finish
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
very
flavorful
taste
even
though
the
smell
left
a
little
to
be
desired
for
this
was
the
first
of
three
sisters
so
hopefully
the
others
will
follow
through
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
im
glad
the
barrel
and
fruit
take
over
the
smell
and
taste
instead
of
vinegar
or
tartness
it
provides
a
bit
more
balance
than
im
used
to
with
american
wild
ales
overall
impression
not
sure
if
g
i
was
using
lolita
in
the
sense
of
the
novel
written
in
the
1950s
but
it
sure
was
a
good
special
release
brew
i
would
suggest
you
getting
the
madame
rose
if
the
goose
island
clybourn
location
i
havent
tried
the
juliet
but
it
is
next
on
my
list
the
lolita
was
easy
drinking
like
wine
with
slight
sour
notes
and
raspberry
enjoyed
thoroughly
found
at
cardinal
liqs
niles
il
oi
would
say
this
has
more
in
common
with
a
good
belgian
fruit
lambic
than
an
american
wild
a
very
nice
beer
that
highlights
fruit
and
the
barrels
it
was
placed
in
my
only
complaint
is
the
lack
of
a
proper
head
but
this
could
have
been
unique
to
my
bottle
i
wish
i
had
more
to
see
how
this
develops
o
a
good
wild
ale
i
think
i
enjoyed
madame
rose
slightly
more
and
havent
had
juliet
yet
would
like
more
tartness
but
the
amount
of
funk
here
is
pretty
nice
pours
a
slightly
hazy
watery
cranberry
color
with
a
12
inch
fizzy
whitered
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
tart
raspberries
red
wine
vinegar
funk
and
some
wood
aromas
from
the
wine
barrels
taste
is
of
tart
raspberries
wood
and
some
minor
funky
flavors
a
nice
sour
flavor
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
back
of
the
throat
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
there
is
also
a
slightly
acidic
quality
to
this
one
overall
this
is
a
good
wild
ale
with
all
the
nice
sour
and
funky
aromas
and
flavors
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
one
of
these
o
i
enjoyed
this
and
had
many
pours
def
lolita
wins
this
taste
test
appearance
is
gold
with
a
rose
tint
to
it
a
smallish
white
head
the
smell
of
lolita
contains
raspberries
cherries
sugar
and
funk
i
sipped
this
one
and
noticed
tart
raspberries
right
away
brett
and
an
overall
sweetness
that
goes
with
its
tart
quality
mf
medium
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
try
this
one
if
you
come
across
it
lolitas
the
perfect
woman
bright
and
delicious
yet
with
an
enticing
sourness
to
keep
you
on
your
toes
i
could
sit
here
all
night
pondering
her
complexities
and
i
think
i
will
o
this
is
a
great
beer
nice
i
think
its
better
than
madame
rose
maybe
not
quite
as
tasty
as
juliet
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
it
for
less
than
the
25
it
goes
for
in
restaurants
overall
i
feel
this
is
the
weakest
of
the
three
sisters
the
high
carbonation
combined
with
a
thinner
than
usual
mouthfeel
really
did
throw
off
the
beer
making
the
flavors
less
prominent
than
i
feel
they
could
have
been
had
the
aforementioned
two
things
been
toned
down
a
bit
i
had
no
problem
emptying
my
glass
and
will
be
curious
to
see
how
this
is
after
a
few
more
years
overall
finding
other
flavors
and
depth
beyond
raspberry
takes
some
effort
and
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
really
moves
me
compared
to
some
of
the
other
complex
beers
of
this
style
this
is
fairly
forgettable
o
this
is
really
lovely
and
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
its
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
would
drink
this
on
any
summer
afternoon
were
it
available
in
my
part
of
the
country
and
a
little
less
expensive
o
ive
only
had
the
juliet
before
this
one
and
lolita
was
a
nice
followup
to
that
it
was
a
bit
like
juliet
but
with
more
berry
presence
than
grape
presence
just
wish
we
could
get
this
a
bit
more
poured
brownish
red
with
no
head
into
my
dfh
signature
glass
aroma
of
oak
and
funk
not
much
of
a
hint
of
raspberries
but
it
is
there
in
the
background
taste
follows
the
nose
really
oaky
more
than
most
beers
ive
had
more
fruit
in
the
taste
tart
but
still
smooth
while
hiding
the
alcohol
tasty
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
overall
a
very
good
brew
should
go
well
with
goat
cheese
its
not
my
favorite
of
the
gi
wild
series
well
crafted
and
tasty
solid
enough
across
the
board
save
for
the
appearance
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
a
reasonable
pour
produced
a
barely
there
head
a
puff
of
smoke
if
you
will
a
thin
white
ring
remains
deep
orangish
red
and
oddly
enough
some
purple
hughes
as
well
the
nose
is
where
this
beer
does
its
thing
sharp
sour
raspberry
all
the
way
very
lactic
faint
faint
white
oak
aroma
sadly
the
flavor
doesnt
depart
much
from
the
nose
not
much
complexity
fruity
but
lactickly
sour
raspberry
sharp
and
lemony
the
sour
really
gets
right
into
your
nose
some
oak
and
vanilla
hits
the
tongue
thats
it
fair
mouthfeel
for
a
wild
not
thin
i
think
the
raspberry
rounds
that
out
this
beer
is
ok
i
have
one
in
the
cellar
for
later
and
it
is
good
enough
for
me
to
think
about
grabbing
another
to
age
a
bit
longer
all
in
all
more
wood
and
more
funk
please
i
didnt
have
much
paper
available
to
me
at
the
time
that
i
drank
this
so
my
notes
are
really
sparse
i
noted
a
rating
for
astmo
but
only
a
few
notes
about
the
beer
itself
so
ill
keep
this
short
taste
was
tart
very
raspberrycherry
with
a
great
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
that
spread
through
the
mouth
excitedly
taste
wasnt
extremely
complex
or
dynamic
mostly
just
straight
up
raspberriescherries
with
varying
sensations
of
tartness
or
sweetness
it
was
reminiscent
of
lost
abbeys
red
poppy
to
me
in
this
sense
though
this
was
a
little
less
layered
id
say
good
glad
i
tried
it
not
sure
its
worth
seeking
out
though
or
worth
the
price
overall
i
enjoyed
this
but
my
expectations
were
a
little
higher
the
high
carbonation
kind
of
ruins
it
for
me
however
anyone
who
enjoys
sparkling
wine
or
any
red
wine
would
probably
like
this
this
one
would
make
a
great
outdoor
summertime
drink
its
flavor
profile
is
not
burdensome
and
its
body
is
light
and
airy
o
my
first
of
the
3
sisters
i
was
happy
with
my
first
go
its
nice
to
have
an
american
wild
that
goes
the
funky
route
instead
of
just
bracingly
sour
the
flavors
work
really
well
good
for
summer
this
would
have
been
great
with
more
carbonation
overall
quite
funky
wit
nice
fruit
aromas
and
flavor
not
nearly
as
comlex
and
gratifying
as
juliet
though
2212011
overall
the
mild
raspberry
and
wine
notes
were
very
nice
together
and
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
they
didnt
overpower
the
beer
sour
notes
are
there
but
they
let
the
fruit
do
its
job
o
the
well
blended
soft
tartness
supports
the
full
dark
fruit
flavor
with
a
nice
bit
of
acidity
it
would
be
nice
to
taste
a
little
more
of
the
funk
and
wood
but
it
is
delicious
non
the
less
da
very
easy
drinking
and
thirst
quenching
beer
not
really
all
that
tart
or
sour
which
i
was
kind
of
hoping
it
would
be
o
if
this
didnt
have
the
big
sweetness
to
it
i
would
have
really
enjoyed
it
a
lot
more
as
it
stands
just
a
good
beer
overall
a
pretty
solid
sour
easy
drinking
i
still
wish
the
taste
was
more
like
the
nose
however
another
solid
offering
served
in
a
snifter
glass
and
pours
a
rosy
rust
colored
red
with
a
slight
head
very
raspberry
fruity
nose
with
some
acetone
type
notes
as
well
light
mouthfeel
raspberry
sweetness
upfront
with
a
slight
bitterness
almost
like
biting
and
tasting
raspberry
seeds
no
booze
notes
at
all
to
speak
ok
some
mild
acetone
type
sourness
but
not
overly
mouthpuckering
by
any
means
i
think
this
is
a
really
decent
beer
right
now
but
with
time
should
develop
further
to
increase
its
mediocre
complexity
overall
very
nice
would
buy
a
bottle
if
i
see
one
overall
goes
down
easy
but
isnt
very
interesting
kind
of
like
a
young
slut
aka
a
lolita
again
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
focus
on
the
raspberries
the
tartnesss
and
acidity
is
spot
on
though
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
a
sunny
afternoon
o
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
sourness
and
tartness
are
not
overpowering
overall
tasty
and
refreshing
on
a
day
like
this
nice
fruit
profile
o
was
between
buying
a
bottle
of
this
and
madame
rose
and
while
i
have
still
not
had
madame
rose
i
was
very
happy
with
my
choice
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
very
drinkable
sour
it
isnt
the
most
funky
or
sourest
wild
ale
out
there
but
was
refreshing
and
a
beer
i
felt
like
i
could
have
drank
the
whole
bottle
of
light
sour
raspberries
and
cherries
complimented
by
light
funk
and
oak
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
one
the
first
pour
of
lolita
yields
a
radiant
clear
cherry
red
beer
theres
a
little
bit
of
pink
tinged
foam
crowning
the
beer
but
it
fades
quickly
and
without
leaving
a
trace
the
second
pour
would
introduce
some
sediment
and
cloud
the
beer
up
the
nose
is
very
raspberry
centric
with
a
bit
of
acidity
to
it
it
comes
across
as
a
less
bold
weyerbacher
riserva
the
flavor
has
a
bit
more
nuance
to
it
as
pure
raspberry
is
smoothed
out
by
some
dark
fruitiness
from
the
wine
barrels
in
addition
theres
a
little
bit
of
funk
to
take
the
vinegar
edge
off
the
noticeable
tartness
i
have
to
say
for
a
beer
that
specifically
mentions
brett
but
no
other
critters
it
sure
is
still
overpoweringly
sour
rather
than
funky
this
one
finished
out
just
a
little
too
dry
for
me
either
that
or
it
was
too
highly
carbonated
whatever
the
cause
that
balance
was
thrown
off
and
resulted
in
an
overly
spritzy
mouthfeel
especially
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
once
it
had
warmed
some
were
it
not
for
a
pretty
great
flavor
goose
island
gets
from
the
raspberries
lolita
aged
on
itd
be
an
entirely
average
attempt
at
a
wild
ale
overall
decent
beer
but
not
that
impressive
or
worth
seeking
out
it
was
okay
to
drink
but
like
all
of
the
goose
island
sours
except
for
maybe
juliet
i
would
never
seek
it
out
or
bother
trying
it
again
tasting
not
surprisingly
of
raspberry
light
acidity
and
some
mild
funk
flavors
extremely
smooth
and
easy
drinking
definitely
does
not
come
across
as
a
7
abv
beer
healthy
carbonation
and
a
light
body
second
of
the
three
sisters
in
preference
madame
rose
easily
beats
this
on
my
scale
partially
wild
but
mostly
tamed
it
is
good
but
i
would
hesitate
at
the
wild
ale
categorization
in
taste
but
the
aroma
seems
about
right
overall
goose
island
might
be
the
king
of
bourbon
barrels
but
theyre
definitely
far
away
from
being
the
kings
of
wine
barrels
i
dont
see
lolita
improving
with
age
because
i
do
not
see
any
flavor
notes
that
are
hidden
that
will
improve
over
time
but
only
time
will
tell
hazy
reddishamber
the
head
dissipates
quickly
settling
to
a
thin
collar
tons
of
brettanomyces
on
the
nose
leaving
a
damp
barnyard
aroma
theres
a
juicy
raspberry
character
beneath
the
funk
along
with
mild
acetic
notes
the
palate
is
juicy
and
lightly
acetic
heavy
on
funky
brett
with
a
mild
but
pleasant
raspberry
note
finishes
with
light
tannins
lactic
sourness
very
dry
but
only
mildly
sour
d
could
be
a
touch
less
sour
and
more
fruity
a
little
bit
worse
in
this
category
than
the
other
two
gi
sours
juliet
madame
rose
d
not
your
every
day
standard
but
interesting
the
tartness
will
slow
you
down
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
sour
styles
tart
and
puckering
seedy
raspberry
minor
authentic
fruitderived
sweetness
very
distinct
raspberry
notes
mildly
acetic
wet
oak
clean
and
crisp
feel
very
quenching
a
bit
simple
could
use
more
brett
complexity
and
barrel
character
as
it
is
it
seems
young
the
fruit
forward
character
is
nice
and
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
though
it
ultimately
seems
to
be
lacking
a
bit
in
depth
md
medium
body
and
very
dry
champagnelike
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
but
hard
to
drink
fast
due
to
how
dry
it
is
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
be
inclined
to
drink
more
than
one
d
oh
yes
without
a
doubt
whish
i
could
get
more
of
this
so
lucky
to
have
though
d
fantastic
drinkability
here
like
madame
rose
this
is
a
sour
that
doesnt
strip
the
enamel
from
your
teeth
i
cant
imagine
what
a
16
barrel
of
this
would
cost
but
this
and
madame
rose
is
something
i
can
could
see
putting
on
in
my
kegerator
d
a
good
one
for
sure
age
will
open
this
up
more
too
bad
i
cant
find
out
until
they
actually
release
this
outside
of
their
bar
and
restaurants
overall
i
think
i
prefer
madame
rose
in
flavor
but
this
in
sour
dryness
i
think
this
has
potential
for
being
a
big
sour
with
age
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
a
great
addition
to
goose
islands
already
fantastic
barrel
aged
series
g
i
has
got
their
barrel
game
down
lolita
is
initially
flavorful
but
unobtrusive
which
will
make
it
a
very
nice
pairing
with
just
about
any
kind
of
fish
its
compatibility
with
food
may
be
the
reason
that
goose
island
decided
that
it
would
limit
distribution
to
restaurants
its
a
shame
because
i
believe
that
like
its
sister
juliet
some
age
could
open
this
beer
up
and
bring
it
to
the
next
level
whilst
out
to
bear
witness
to
an
80s
extravaganza
what
better
beer
to
order
than
a
wild
that
made
it
only
to
precious
few
stores
in
the
area
it
pours
a
clear
garnetamber
topped
by
a
minor
bit
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
raspberry
cranberry
cobwebs
brett
peaches
red
apple
and
sour
cherry
the
taste
holds
notes
of
tart
orange
cobwebs
brett
light
caramel
light
cream
cheese
lime
and
grapefruit
zest
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
wild
but
nothing
really
outstanding
here
by
any
means
to
me
its
too
much
like
an
odd
tart
wine
to
allow
thorough
enjoyment
d
the
appearance
and
smell
of
this
beer
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
ones
gonna
be
amazing
but
the
taste
never
quite
gets
there
not
really
tight
funky
or
oaky
i
would
definitely
like
to
revisit
this
one
somewhere
down
the
line
but
as
is
ill
pass
for
now
md
body
and
carbonation
both
fit
the
brew
well
drinks
easily
and
enjoyably
a
solid
offering
d
solid
no
big
flaws
interesting
take
on
style
this
is
another
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
with
some
age
the
beer
right
now
is
young
with
some
time
i
see
this
really
becoming
great
a
nice
splurge
especially
for
those
who
enjoy
the
style
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
am
admittedly
a
goose
island
fanboy
but
this
was
a
solid
beer
either
way
the
fact
that
it
is
26
and
mostly
in
restaurants
only
means
i
probably
wont
be
trying
it
again
anytime
soon
which
is
shame
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
great
and
was
not
quite
as
good
as
what
i
was
hoping
for
great
brew
this
is
a
very
primary
beer
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
some
wild
ales
but
beautifully
displays
its
fruit
characteristics
perhaps
with
age
the
secondary
characteristics
will
come
out
more
however
like
the
juliet
i
would
be
afraid
that
the
beautiful
display
of
fruit
would
fade
robbing
the
beer
of
its
best
quality
welldone
goose
island
it
was
a
treat
seeking
these
beers
out
i
look
forward
to
the
2011
versions
i
liked
this
better
than
juliet
maybe
tied
with
madame
rose
nothing
special
by
any
means
being
only
in
expensive
restaurants
at
29
a
bottle
i
just
cant
recommend
this
despite
the
above
average
rating
interesting
beer
and
something
im
looking
forward
to
trying
again
but
not
sure
how
much
you
could
drink
in
one
sitting
nevertheless
this
is
one
to
seek
out
once
they
bottle
it
later
this
year
delicious
fizzy
decent
body
fine
for
the
style
not
an
easy
drinker
complex
brew
that
is
good
not
great
i
still
find
it
offensivei
dont
care
if
it
was
intentional
overall
not
bad
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
its
just
not
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
nevertheless
its
a
good
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so
great
tasting
sour
top
notch
a
really
nice
and
unique
sour
from
surly
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
third
sour
ive
tried
and
not
a
fan
of
the
style
except
ng
oud
bruin
o
a
wonderful
complex
brett
beer
that
spectacularly
balances
sour
funk
fruit
wood
and
malt
flavors
if
you
go
to
the
brewery
a
glass
of
pentagram
and
the
smoked
mushroom
and
goat
cheese
pizza
are
a
diabolical
combination
flavor
overall
it
hits
your
tongue
and
then
develops
for
a
while
i
dont
know
why
people
are
putting
this
at
92
overall
while
its
not
quite
supplication
or
consecration
its
an
amazing
beer
the
balance
between
the
barnyard
funk
and
wine
barrel
is
nearly
perfect
and
wellbalanced
with
the
alcohol
id
drink
this
every
day
if
i
wasnt
dropping
such
a
penny
on
it
o
this
is
a
nice
dark
wild
ale
by
surly
it
aged
gracefully
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
in
the
middle
of

brew
with

13
was
better
than
14
tasted
this
not
long
after
tasting
a
2014
la
folie
there
was
more
subtle
notes
in
this
beer
but
there
were
fairly
similar
overall
the
cherry
notes
are
nice
on
this
beer
others
noted
tobacco
in
the
beer
as
well
but
i
had
just
finished
a
cigar
ill
admit
the
bottle
design
is
what
got
me
to
buy
the
bottle
but
im
glad
i
did
the
sour
cherry
flavor
felt
odd
at
first
but
i
soon
got
use
to
it
after
the
third
sip
overall
a
good
beer
probably
something
i
would
pick
up
for
date
night
o
the
super
unique
flavors
make
this
a
hard
beer
to
review
because
of
the
brett
strain
this
is
my
second
brett
beer
ive
had
so
im
still
getting
used
to
the
style
it
wants
to
be
many
things
all
at
once
but
you
can
still
pick
out
each
individual
component
its
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
is
very
satisfying
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
can
find
it
pentagram
pours
a
purpleish
amber
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
very
sour

lots
of

notes
the
taste
has
some
big
sour
notes
nice
dry
fruit
flavors
big
and
huge
flavors
good
body
nicely
carbonated
overall
its
a
big
and
powerful
sour
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
nicely
balanced
mild
sweetness
and
tartness
start
before
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sticky
sour
balance
each
other
nicely
slightly
dry
finish
o
truthfully
one
of
the
first
wild
ales
that
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
only
discrepancy
is
the
price
which
is
a
bit
more
than
i
feel
is
fair
for
this
beer
but
overall
a
very
very
solid
offering
from
surly
slightly
cloudy
medium
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of
tart
cherries
and
lemon
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
at
the
edges
the
flavor
is
light
lactic
tart
with
a
healthy
dose
of
funk
but
still
has
a
bit
of
residual
malty
sweetness
left
to
it
the
darker
malts
lend
to
a
slightly
chalky
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
wild
ale
but
nothing
horribly
exciting
final
thoughts
was
it
worth
the
year
long
wait
in
the
fridge
i
guess
it
met
my
expectations
sour
lovers
should
check
it
out
but
dont
splurge
if
its
not
one
of
your
favorite
styles
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
a
nice
mellow
sour
stout
nice
balance
of
malt
sweetness
with
brett
and
wine
barrel
mellow
for
surly
and
its
ok
by
me
sour
stoutssour
dark
beers
are
quite
the
challenge
im
not
particularly
surprised
that
surly
was
up
to
the
challenge
this
is
very
tasty
it
balances
the
dark
notes
with
the
sour
notes
in
a
nice
way
its
kind
of
like
a
dark
flanders
red
thats
totally
a
style
right
dark
wine
barrel
a
bit
flat
not
extremely
tart
some
vinegar
trace
cherry
this
is
extremely
underwhelming
and
an
average
wild
ale
at
best
i
thought
i
recalled
trying
this
at
a
festival
and
being
less
than
enthused
but
the
high
ratings
convinced
me
otherwise
what
it
is
is
rather
remarkable
and
definitely
delicious
i
have
two
more
bottles
that
i
intend
to
age
even
longer
what
will
it
be
like
at
one
and
a
half
years
two
but
right
now
i
cant
wish
for
anything
better
this
is
a
very
good
sour
combine
the
one
dimensional
taste
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
this
beer
becomes
a
pass
i
had
high
hopes
but
really
thought
this
was
mediocre
at
best
especially
at
the
higher
price
point
o
good
wild
ale
overall
nice
integration
of
the
wine
barrel
the
barrel
ends
up
dominating
the
base
beer
giving
lots
of
earthy
and
woody
flavors
and
heavily
influences
the
overall
with
a
big
red
wine
character
sournesstartness
is
held
in
check
a
bit
a
nice
midlevel
intensity
almost
on
par
with
a
flanders
red
which
this
beer
resembles
in
flavor
tannic
fruity
reasonably
dry
overall
nice
beer
onot
my
favorite
style
nothing
over
the
top
with
this
beer
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
milder
overall
compared
to
five
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
not
overall
pentagram
and
five
are
very
similar
beers
pretty
good
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
or
flavor
profiles
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
dark
sours
but
this
is
really
an
excellent
offering
i
think
the
secret
here
is
that
the
beer
is
very
light
bodied
playful
and
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
with
alcohol
its
a
light
sour
disguised
as
its
darker
cousin
evil
indeed
this
is
a
fantastic
drinking
experience
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
stout
like
this
and
cant
say
id
call
this
a
stout
its
a
great
wildsour
beer
more
leaning
towards
wine
barrel
flavors
and
barnyard
than
it
is
sourness
has
a
nice
amount
of
appletart
qualities
i
know
this
bottles
a
bit
expensive
but
its
worth
trying
high
b
overall
too
much
wine
and
a
little
monotonous
but
a
decent
sour
o
nice
red
wine
sour
not
complex
but
has
more
character
than
most
american
wild
ales
do
this
is
a
really
unique
brew
and
is
bound
to
make
fans
of
sour
lovers
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
terms
of
the
palate
super
solid
over
all
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
d
a
very
well
thought
out
and
crafted
brew
packs
a
strong
punch
tastewise
for
such
a
lightweight
abvwise
extremely
sessionable
dangerously
so
seek
it
out
and
enjoy
o
a
good
sour
that
really
surprised
everyone
at
the
tasting
surly
did
a
good
job
with
this
definitely
more
sour
than
funky
or
barnyardy
if
i
loved
sours
i
would
have
scored
this
one
even
higher
still
tons
of
respect
here
this
is
a
really
good
beer
m
medium
bodied
overall
wow
this
is
excellent
ive
not
had
too
many
sours
mostly
gueuze
but
im
loving
the
combination
of
dark
sweet
malty
flavors
with
that
intense
brett
funk
and
sourness
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
im
glad
i
bought
a
second
bottle
which
i
plan
on
cellaring
for
a
year

two

poured

strong
aromas
of
cherry

and
chocolate
tastes
like
sweet
tabacco
tart
cherries
slight
roast
also
possesses
a
surprisingly
vinous
character
from
the
wine
barrels
more
so
than
i
would
have
expected
this
is
a
sour
ale
perfect
oaking
goes
almost
unnoticed
but
its
there
bright
citrus

with
sour
lactic

acetic

with

along
with

ive
gotten
it
from

99
to
30
sadly
first
one
i
got
paid
25
great
stuff
o
this
is
a
super
odd
beer
very
similar
to
a
flanders
bruin
but
with
red
grapes
replacing
the
dominant
cherry
notes
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
total
heartburn
though
overall
i
thought
this
was
exceptional
i
tasted
with
my
father
in
law
and
a
friend
neither
of
whom
drink
sours
they
were
really
impressed
by
the
complexity
and
so
was
i
i
would
really
like
to
get
another
bottle
and
let
it
sit
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
great
beer
pours
a
dark
hazy
cherryblackberry
color
with
a
small
ring
of
head
smell
is
funky
red
wine
strong
and
heavy
on
the
sour
funk
taste
is
light
sour
cherries
effervescent
white
grape
juice
red
wine
and
slight
vinaigrette
finish
is
sweet
waxy
and
winey
overall
this
is
a
nice
awa
it
is
clean
and
not
too
intense
but
has
some
nice
darker
fruit
notes
mixed
in
with
the
tartness
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
i
thought
the
nose
was
awesome
just
full
of
sour
red
wine
cherries
and
dark
fruits
working
in
a
little
bit
of
brett
and
some
roasty
chatacteristics
taste
has
more
roast
and
malts
but
still
nice
easy
to
drink
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
brown
tints
the
head
is
half
an
inch
of
white
foam
that
recedes
quickly
into
nothing
the
aroma
is
of
sour
cherries
green
apples
and
jolly
rancher
the
taste
is
has
some
nice
sour
and
tart
notes
but
doesnt
quite
create
the
pucker
factor
i
usually
look
for
in
a
sour
it
does
however
have
a
really
nice
complimentary
funkiness
that
fills
in
admirably
in
place
of
the
pucker
in
fact
the
sourfunky
combo
give
this
beer
a
dimension
that
i
cant
recall
encounterint
before
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
dry
with
spritzy
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
another
winner
from
surly
i
only
wish
id
have
bought
more
than
one
bottle
when
i
had
the
chance
pours
a
clear
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
fruit
acidic
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
wood
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
pretty
easy
to
drink
my
first
bottled
offering
from
surly
this
had
been
described
to
be
as
just
like
consecration
so
needless
to
say
i
was
stoked
hard
it
pours
a
similarly
cloudy
autumn
red
color
with
not
nearly
as
much
carbonation
and
a
minimal
white
head
there
is
a
bunch
of
super
fine
suspended
yeast
in
this
too
the
nose
is
cherry
heavy
with
the
wine
treatment
also
being
quite
obvious
it
smells
sour
but
its
front
of
the
tongue
stuff
not
all
encompassing
as
consecration
is
the
flavor
has
plenty
of
oak
too
it
lots
of
tart
fruit
and
a
sour
profile
thats
true
to
the
nose
its
piquant
and
acidic
maybe
a
little
too
much
so
really
at
least
if
it
wants
to
be
more
drinkable
all
the
components
are
present
but
the
unity
is
whats
missing
in
my
opinion
the
acid
detracts
the
mouthfeel
after
a
glass
or
so
my
teeth
start
to
dry
out
and
hurt
and
my
tongue
feels
like
ive
been
hammering
sour
patch
kids
its
actually
really
good
and
an
impressive
first
i
think
sour
beer
from
surly
contrary
to
popular
opinion
though
this
does
not
stand
up
ton
consecration
at
all
better
carbonation
than
it
shows
and
the
body
is
only
medium
very
long
finish
despite
its
drying
effects
a
funny
but
enjoyable
peculiarity
overall
a
worthy
beer
and
a
treat
to
try
but
i
would
not
buy
this
with
a
consecration
on
the
shelf
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
burgundy
color
with
a
tannish
hire
head
on
top
the
head
settled
leaving
a
soap
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
light
lacing
as
well
the
smell
is
big
with
sour
notes
and
wine
barrel
aging
its
also
got
a
nice
sweet
aroma
slight
cherrylike
aromas
on
the
nose
the
taste
isnt
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
might
be
the
beer
has
a
subtle
tart
flavor
with
some
cherry
or
grape
flavors
there
is
some
earthy
tobacco
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
this
is
a
great
sour
ale
wished
i
had
another
bottle
so
ill
put
some
time
on
it
to
see
how
it
turns
out
this
is
definitely
going
into
my
iso
list
oda
neat
sour
not
a
stunner
but
its
quite
interesting
one
of
those
beers
that
seemingly
brings
a
new
flavor
with
every
sip
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
bubbles
but
overall
this
was
quite
nice
and
very
flavorful
i
think
this
is
easily
my
favorite
sour
beer
yet
from
surly
o
tart
and
funky
but
not
overpowering
like
some
other
sours
a
good
beer
i
feel
it
will
be
best
with
about
threesix
years
on
it
it
needs
a
while
to
develop
heat
is
not
apparent
and
is
nicely
blended
recommended
i
hope
to
rereview
with
better
news
i
loved
five
overall
a
real
interesting
take
on
wild
quite
decent
i
tend
to
really
love
surlys
sours
and
this
is
no
exception
this
would
be
a
regularly
purchase
if
i
could
a
solid
beer
but
for
a
20
beer
i
was
a
bit
letdown
better
than
five
but
i
know
i
am
in
the
minority
and
thinks
surly
should
scrap
their
sour
program
they
have
a
long
ways
to
go
to
rival
the
great
american
sour
breweries
awesome
bottle
art
however
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
american
wild
ale
lively
and
well
balanced
wine
barrel
and
malt
flavors
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
evolves
o
this
is
an
awesome
sour
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
pentagram
has
everything
i
look
for
in
this
style
of
brew
drinkability
is
superb
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
turns
out
with
some
age
pours
from
a
waxsealed
750ml
bottle
cola
brown
with
a
very
transient
dark
foam
head
quite
effervescent
after
15
seconds
the
head
is
completely
gone
but
for
a
thin
rim
around
the
glass
so
its
not
much
in
appearance
although
the
bottle
is
hellishly
cool
looking
pervasive
smell
is
of
a
high
quality
red
wine
vinegar
perhaps
a
hint
of
worcestershire
sweetness
balsamic
oak
and
tart
cherries
certainly
it
smells
good
like
something
id
want
to
use
for
cooking
a
fine
roast
shoulder
in
a
reduction
with
mushrooms
and
rosemary
now
the
taste
is
immediately
far
less
pungent
than
the
nose
suggests
which
is
a
bit
disappointing
its
pretty
zippy
high
carbonation
and
quite
watery
on
the
palate
back
to
the
taste
its
lightly
tart
cherries
washed
with
a
weak
solution
of
heinz
white
vinegar
there
is
some
sense
of
balsamic
sweetness
as
well
so
sweet
and
sour
medium
dry
again
watery
and
strong
carbonation
all
sitting
on
a
sort
of
thinnish
brown
ale
like
underpinning
well
then

abv
i
am
not
a
big
sour
fan
at
all
but
i
really
like
this
one
the
funk
and
tartness
are
more
approachable
for
the
style
but
the
come
itty
of
the
flavor
is
what
grabs
my
attention
if
not
for
the
price
tag
i
would
buy
up
another
couple
of
these
well
done
overall
for
the
style
though
very
nice
wild
edit
ive
noticed
some
variation
in
sourness
from
bottle
to
bottle
the
stuff
i
had
on
tap
wasnt
as
tart
as
the
first
bottle
i
reviewed
cant
wait
for
the
bottle
release
this
stuff
is
solid
on
tap
at
the
bruery
poured
into
taster
appearance
is

with
a

funky

as
well
thanks
to
the
barrels
and
rye
lots
going
on
taste
delivers
on
the
sourness
from
the
nose
with
a
forceful
blast
of
initial
tartness
citrus
cherry
grape
followed
by
a
mellow
vanilla
sweetness
rye
spice
on
the
swallow
and
a
touch
of
oak
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
body
a
little
creamy
moderate
carbonation
long
puckering
dry
finish
this
beer
was
phenomenal
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
a
bottle
last
night
and
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
it
was
amazing
do
yourself
a
favor
and
if
you
see
it
pick
up
a
bottle
had
at
brewery
the
bruery
awesome
sour
perfect
expensive
tasting
round
though
but
worth
it
this
is
an
complex
beer
which
balances
and
blends
a
variety
of
different
elements
into
a
excellent
whole
sourness
is
noticeable
but
not
intense
like
say
a
love
child
i
suspect
that
cellaring
this
for
a
few
years
would
deepen
the
sour
flavors
tasted

this

surprise
very

puckering

and
some

id
like
to
get
another
bottle
some
time
and
age
it
for
about
three
years
and
see
what
happens
to
it
my
bottle
was
relatively
fresh
at
just
11
months
old
while
some
reviewers
felt
that
sour
in
the
rye
is
an
overwhelmingly
sour
and
acidic
wild
ale
i
found
it
to
be
remarkably
complex
and
amazingly
well
balanced
in
fact
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
wilds
i
have
tried
in
quite
some
time
i
would
love
to
lay
down
a
bottle
or
two
and
see
how
the
beer
ages
but
my
guess
is
that
it
peaks
after
only
a
year
of
cellaring
extremely
sour
with
no
balance
or
complexity
sauerkraut
with
alcohol
not
my
cup
of
tea
poured
a
gorgeous
translucent
reddish

body
with
a

of

very
nice
looking
scents
of
sour
cherry
wild
barnyard
funk
stone
fruit
and
sweet
tart
red

along
with
slight
oak
overall
impression
is
of
a
nice

aroma
that
is

and
nicely
funky
very
nice
flavor
begins
moderately
sour
with
notes
of
sour
cherry
brett
funk
and
a
bit
of
spicy
rye
along
with
hints
of
oak
this
moves
into
a
still
sour
middle
with
further
notes
of
cherry
and
a
bit
of
spicy
rye
with
oak
still
present
finish
is
dry
and
moderately
high
in

overall
impression
is
of
a
nicely

dry
and

beer

a
nice
oak
presence
and
funk
very
nice
and
quite
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying

feel
quite
nice
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
sour
ale
it
has
a
wonderful
aroma
and
flavor
profile
that
is
fruity
funky
oaky
and
slightly
spicy
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
that
aids
the
drinkability
highly
recommended
medium
body
and
heavily
carbonated
with
fine
carbonation
that
is
very
gentle
on
the
tongue
keeping
the
beer
very
drinkable
this
is
a
world
class
sour
i
get
sour
sour
and
more
sour
with
a
slight
vinegar
aftertaste
the
vinegar
is
very
mild
and
not
the
taste
stealing
the
show
the
rye
comes
in
slowly
but
its
there
providing
a
great
layering
faint
lemon
juice
but
this
is
a
puckering
masterpiece
not
a
huge
fan
of
sours
wow
this
is
goodgoodgood
the
sourness
sets
you
up
for
the
vanillin
from
the
oak
as
well
as
the
rye
spice
cant
drink
just
one
the
lack
of
head
is
typical
of
the
wild
sours
at
least
the
ones
that
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
try
but
is
still
detrimental
to
the
overall
enjoyment
the
barrel
must
really
even
this
sour
out
as
its
not
too
tart
but
the
flavors
were
easily
preserved
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
sours
i
have
tried
so
far
tried
it
on
a
recommendation
from
brawleys
pricey
but
worth
it
o
tasty
but
like
a
lot
of
bruery
sours
its
both
high
in
sourness
and
a
bit
one
dimensional
o
good
sour
but
not
my
favorite
from
the
bruery
i
think
i
should
have
kept
this
in
the
cellar
a
bit
longer
to
let
the
tartness
mellow
and
the
other
flavors
develop
prost
the
taste
is
very
sour
with
excellent
depth
after
the
initial
shock
of
just
how
sour
this
beer
is
it
really
begins
to
show
off
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
for
fans
of
sours
but
newbies
will
want
to
stick
to
lessintense
varieties
after
having
tried
only
one
of
the
bruerys
other
sour
offerings
tart
of
darkness
i
have
to
say
that
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
others
pours
a
nice
reddish
brownish
beer
has
very
little
foam
forming
at
the
top
smells
like
bretts
taste
is
sour
raspberries
and
tart
fruits
and
then
the
rye
comes
in
strongly
it
adds
a
dimension
that
reminds
me
of
whisky
o
a
very
nice
sour
that
has
a
lot
of
tartness
a
lot
of
juiciness
and
big
flavor
bravo
pours
crystal
brown
moderate
carbonation
good
for
this
style
beer
aromas
of
slightly
fermented
red
fruits
aged
malts
and
sourdough
after
the
first
sip
i
couldnt
say
anything
for
about
a
minute
because
of
how
much
saliva
the
acidity
drew
out
the
taste
started
with
super
high
acidity
but
gradually
gave
way
to
nice
integrated
malt
with
an
amazing
long
finish
o
a
definitely
worth
ever
dollar
with
i
had
a
few
more
bottle
for
the
cellar
and
wanting
to
seek
out
more
by
these
guys
a
bit
spendy
but
sure
beats
many
other
sours
ive
had
for
the
same
price
or
more
overall
this
is
an
incredible
sour
with
a
great
level
of
tartness
hard
to
believe
there
isnt
any
fruit
in
here
with
how
much
flavor
there
is
good
job
yeasties
had
this
on
draft
at
bruery
pint
night
at
columbia
ale
house
similar
to
style
there
was
very
little
head
to
speak
of
excellent
smell
but
not
quite
the
bang
of
some
then
the
taste
wow
excellent
made
me
pucker
which
was
awesome
and
enjoyable
one
of
the
top
sours
i
have
had
and
one
i
would
love
to
have
again
the
sour
was
very
comparable
to
the
tart
of
darkness
which
i
had
last
night
great
beer
and
a
must
try
if
you
like
sours
great
sour
not
for
the
uninitiated
but
definitely
not
one
dimensional
great
sour
nice
and
puckery
with
lots
of
citrus
and
tart
flavors
but
with
a
slightly
soft
finish
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
so
it
doesnt
feel
as
if
its
taking
the
enamel
off
of
your
teeth
good
long
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
sweet
citrus
at
the
end
the
most
intriguing
part
of
the
beer
though
is
the
touch
of
spicy
rye
that
intermingles
with
the
sourness
its
definitely
there
as
an
undercurrent
to
the
more
pronounced
sour
flavors
the
rye
really
adds
something
here
and
rounds
the
whole
thing
out
very
enjoyable
beer
from
a
great
brewery
the
price
is
high
but
to
me
worth
it
and
id
put
down
20
for
a
750ml
anytime
very
frothy
head
crests
around
one
finger
almost
entirely
extra
large
bubbles
so
its
gone
like
that
no
meaningful
lacing
to
speak
of
strong
glow
to
the
liquid
really
captures
light
inside
the
glass
gauzy
rust
orange
to

with

fine

to
get
the
most
out
of
the

but
even
then
not
getting
much
oak
element
glimmer
of
caramel
its
muscular
nature
keeps
it
loitering
for
some
time
mediumbodied
the
sourness
and
overall
bite
activates
the
palate
right
off
while
here
the
oak
brings
some
textural
creaminess
in
addition
to
vanilla
and
butter
notes
even
dill
weed
as
created
by
some
american
oak
barrels
there
is
a
certain
volatility
to
it

with
some

peach
and
a
little
white

not
the
peach
version
but
still
has
some
of
those
notes
really
nice
flavor
is
a
nice
crisp
sour
green
apple
with
plenty
of
lacto
and
big
acidity
some
light

and
a

and
a

an
amazing
blend
of

if
this
wasnt
20
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
definately
gotta
grab
a
few
more
for
the
long
haul
intense
and
complex
but
somehow
simple
and
easy
wondering
what
one
of
these
would
taste
like
if
aged
for
a
year
or
two
but
satisfied
nonetheless
also
hoping
to
get
the
chance
at
some
point
to
try
a
sour
in
the
rye
with
peaches
or
other
fruit
as
that
might
be
where
it
lacks
in
the
taste
another
case
of
a
beer
not
being
on
my
radar
in
this
case
was
looking
for

alas

its

a

for
the

lover
that
falls
a

short
this
beer
is
short
on

and
the

do
not

balanced
with
a

overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
overall
this
is
pretty
much
a
basic
expression
of
what
the
bruery
does
if
you
dont
like
it
you
probably
wont
like
many
of
their
beers
or
at
least
their
beers
you
can
just
buy
on
the
shelf
of
your
local
bottleshop
really
good
beer
that
flirts
at
the
edge
of
greatness
othis
is
good
for
a
change
though
i
couldnt
make
a
steady
diet
of
it
like
my
malted
grains
too
much
for
the
sours
ive
had
this
is
an
above
average
offering
from
the
bruery
would
try
again
during
warm
weather
and
see
if
it
drinks
different
then
give
raul
another
excellent
beer
complex
flavour
rounded
out
by
oak
nice
another
bruery
sour
worth
drinking
this
is
an
exceptional
sour
from
the
bruery
its
unexpectedly
sour
extremely
tart
with
some
genuinely
interesting
fruit
flavors
arguably
unlike
some
other
bruery
offerings
this
is
legitimately
worth
the
price
of
admission
overall
one
of
the
most
delicious
sour
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
the
smell
is
delightfully
crisp
and
the
sourness
is
intense
but
not
over
powering
the
aroma
is
the
perfect
spoilerfree
trailer
for
this
blockbuster
of
a
beer
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
sours
and
will
definitely
be
buying
several
more
overall
surprised
by
the
refreshing
yet
very
complex
nature
of
this
beer
the
balance
of
funk
and
sour
is
superb
and
very
fun
to
observe
superb

the

bleh
o
i
love
it
highly
recommended
will
have
again
very
competent
and
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
if
you
think
about
it
actual
fruits
are
typically
somewhat
tart
as
well
as
sweet
this
is
true
to
varying
degrees
of
apples
blackberries
blueberries
cherries
plums
currants
etc
american
wild
ales
like
sour
in
the
rye
simulate
the
fruits
of
mother
natures
labours
pun
intended
and
using
another
wonder
of
nature
wild
yeast
simply
amp
up
the
tart
part
what
a
treat
the
taste
of
rye
and
sour
is
a
challenging
attempt
as
both
types
are
highly
polarizing
and
not
widespread
just
yet
but
its
added
complexity
is
undeniable
taste
thats
salty
briney
and
deeply
earthen
somewhat
of
a
one
dimensional
sour
has
everything
you
would
expect
in
a
good
sour
but
lacks
any
extra
complexity
still
top
notch
and
worthy
of
a
bottle
for
the
cellar
still
another
well
made
beer
from
the
bruery
almost
identical
to
the
sour
with
cumquats
without
the
citrusy
twist
no
discernible
difference
between
tap
and
bottle
tastes
very
fruity
with
plenty
of
apples
and
pear
the
sourness
is
very
apparent
and
strong
with
acetic
acid
very
little
if
any
rye
impact
a
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
end
with
maybe
some
sour
cherry
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
sid
of
medium
with
lively
carbonation
that
seems
to
increase
the
impact
of
the
sourness
a
truly
wild
sour
ale
with
the
acid
overtaking
some
of
the
subtleties

great
beer
just
like
how
they
do
it
in
belgium
great
cherry

sour
notes
that
are
made
more
complex
by
the
oakyvanilla
notes
spicy
rye
malt
kicks
up
the
flavor
more
than
wheat
does
in
many
belgian
sours
o
beautiful
a
great
sour
that
i
would
drink
again
in
a
heartbeat
very
awesome
stuff
if
youre
into
puckeringly
sour
and
vinegarladen
wild
ales
this
brew
isnt
for
everyone
but
its
certainly
for
me
although
its
sometimes
hard
to
justify
spending
nearly
20
for
a
bottle
of
beer
i
think
i
can
easily
make
a
case
in
my
mind
to
keep
a
few
bottles
of
sour
in
the
rye
stocked
at
all
times
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
white
winey
and
sour
t
the
perfect
summer
treat
sip
and
be
soured
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
the
sour
that
started
it
all
for
me
at
least
this
is
the
beer
that
opened
my
eyes
and
has
made
me
want
to
try
all
the
sours
in
the
world
i
have
travel
the
sour
world
around
and
still
have
no
problem
paying
through
the
nose
for
this
one
its
always
a
good
night
with
one
of
these
guys
poured
an
almost
light
brown
with
one
finger
tan
head
that
died
quick
without
much
lace
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
has
a
touch
of
sweet
or
tropicalesque
fruit
but
also
a
large
sour
and
tartness
to
it
want
to
say
cherry
bc
thats
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
medium
bodied
not
chewey
but
a
little
filling
the
rye
helps
smooth
out
as
well
this
beer
has
a
crisp
feel
and
dry
finish
that
perfectly
complements
and
balance
the
sourness
of
the
beer
and
the
spiciness
and
very
mild
sweetness
of
the
beer
helps
round
it
out
a
complex
brew
that
i
cant
really
get
a
handle
on
but
know
i
like
and
a
great
beer
for
all
to
try
o
i
wish
this
beer
turned
down
the
acidity
just
a
tad
to
let
all
the
subtle
notes
come
out
a
bit
more
i
think
there
could
even
be
some
malt
sweetness
underlying
but
thats
hard
to
get
as
well
but
it
is
very
good
give
this
to
someone
that
appreciates
good
beer
and
wine
for
that
matter
they
will
enjoy
it
o
not
the
type
of
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
every
day
but
damn
tasty
the
sourness
is
up
front
and
potent
the
rye
is
awesome
as
a
balance
to
the
sourness
it
adds
a
spice
that
cuts
right
through
this
pours
a
hazy
caramelamber
with
thin
foam
theres
a
sharply
tart
and
sour
touch
of
funk
with
a
hint
of
wet
hay
backing
it
up
tastes
zesty
spicy
and
vibranti
know
thats
not
a
flavor
description
per
se
but
that
was
what
ran
through
my
mind
while
sipping
this
beer
definitely
lives
up
to
its
name
as
it
finishes
sour
tart
acidic
with
a
dry
end
wow
o
amazing
sour
brew
o
very
nice
pours
a
clear
mandarin
hue
with
one
finger
head
and
some
subtle
lacing
here
and
therethe
smell
is
mandarinsspicy
ryeslight
oaktangerine
and
an
ever
present
woodiness
usually
only
smelt
in
fine
winesthe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
a
touch
spritzy
but
spot
on
and
the
tastes
are
mouth
puckering
sour
with
hints
of
tangerinemandarina
slight
hit
of
spicy
ryecheddar
and
finished
with
a
nice
hit
of
oak
and
sour
citrus
and
overall
its
a
beauty
of
a
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
and
be
nice
to
age
to
bring
out
more
of
the
oak
quality
and
this
delicately
tasted
quite
fresh
cheers
o
really
impressed
with
this
sour
havent
had
too
many
of
the
bruerys
sour
beers
this
one
did
everything
i
was
hoping
it
would
refreshing
sour
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
glad
i
have
this
bottle
to
myself
overall
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
with
phenomenal
citrus
notes
coming
through
cant
wait
to
try
the
kumquat
one
one
of
the
more
sour
beers
out
there
not
particularly
complex
at
all
but
very
good
at
what
it
does
bring
to
the
table
dont
know
if
this
is
worth
22
a
bottle
but
this
is
a
very
good
american
wild
if
you
like
sours
its
worth
trying
at
least
once
if
you
dont
like
sours
please
do
not
buy
this
beer
pours

woody
powerful
sour
flavor
from
the
very
start
puckering
tart
hints
of
the
advertised
rye
profoundly
sour
from
start
to
finish
full
of
flavor
the
oak
really
lends
a
great
balance
fantastic
d
this
is
arguably
the
most
well
balanced
and
smoothest
american
wild
ale
or
sour
ale
that
i
have
ever
encountered
its
smooth
sophisticated
and
deeply
complex
i
cant
say
a
single
made
thing
or
make
any
suggestions
for
improvement
probably
the
single
best
beer
i
have
had
from
the
bruery
i
highly
recommend
and
suggest
any
ba
to
seek
out
and
enjoy
very
drinkable
but
i
am
glad
this
was
sampled
amongst
a
group
it
may
have
been
too
much
for
one
person
alcohol
was
hidden
well
but
after
awhile
my
jaw
started
to
hurt
still
a
great
beer
i
know
this
one
is
often
passed
up
on
due
to
the
high
price
but
holy
hell
am
i
glad
i
paid
it
o
this
is
an
increadibly
flavorful
sour
the
rye
is
very
much
underneath
which
is
dominated
by
the
rye
but
the
aftertaste
is
very
much
flavorful
and
true
to
the
label
reminds
me
of
a
flanders
red
and
bruin
with
more
funk
and
i
rather
enjoyed
it
well
concealed
booze
and
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
o
absolutely
amazing
pick
it
up
top
3
sours
for
me
personally
if
you
havent
had
it
get
it
now
like
all
sours
from
the
bruery
this
one
is
very
aggressive
in
its
acidity
and
does
not
hold
back
i
dont
think
i
taste
much
of
the
rye
spiciness
as
it
seems
completely
overpowered
by
the
force
of
the
sour
flavor
nevertheless
this
is
one
of
the
better
americanmade
sours
i
have
had
that
is
not
from
russian
river
despite
the
price
i
will
likely
buy
this
again
the
next
time
it
is
released
it
is
definitely
worth
revisiting
but
its
not
for
those
who
are
new
to
sour
beers
if
there
is
to
be
a
new
world
challenger
to
the
throne
of
cantillon
then
this
may
be
it
its
a
little
too
bad
that
they
had
to
throw
in
a
rye
component
here
because
it
sadly
goes
unloved
seeing
as
it
doesnt
prick
the
tongue
as
harshly
as
the
yeast
and
acid
so
capably
do
once
acclimated
a
caveat
hardly
used
this
side
of
the
pond
this
is
generally
palatable
but
methinks
for
the
wrong
reasons
at
least
a
tad
i
suppose
amber
color
hazy
mediumfrothy
head
canned
apricots
acetic
acid
a
hint
of
biscuit
on
the
palate
quite
sour
mostly
lactic
acid
but
there
is
still
some
malt
backbone
to
balance
alcohol
well
integrated
and
doesnt
stand
out
texture
is
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
beer
from
the
bruery
certainly
in
league
with
any
of
the
russian
river
wild
ales
just
barely
worth
the
high
price
tag
im
still
just
dabbling
in
these
sours
so
while
this
isnt
something
that
im
going
to
necessarily
crave
it
was
an
enjoyable
departure
from
my
typical
big
stout
and
ipa
routine
ill
most
likely
buy
this
again
sometime
and
im
certainly
looking
forward
to
trying
the
kumquat
variation
in
the
near
future
o
on
these
kind
of
occasions
i
can
totally
justify
spending
20
on
a
bottle
of
sour
ale
because
yolo
n
shit
only
for
yours
truly
to
consume
solo
thankfully
this
is
good
enough
where
i
could
easily
justify
doing
such
a
thing
again
actually
its
pretty
fantastic
where
id
purchase
this
somewhat
commonly
goddamnit
ive
been
suckered
in
by
another
sour
ale
stop
draining
my
wallet
dry
delicious
yet
expensive
style
overall
a
wonderful
sour
the
spiciness
from
the
rye
isnt
as
present
as
id
hoped
it
would
be
but
its
there
if
you
hunt
for
it
i
would
drink
this
quite
a
bit
if
i
lived
in
the
san
diego
area
but
there
is
a
local
wild
ale
that
reminds
me
a
great
deal
of
this
one
that
is
much
easier
to
get
this
beer
is
really
delicious
but
it
really
did
not
blow
me
away
as
it
lacks
some
complexity
it
has
issues
with
its
value
i
paid
12
for
12
oz
on
draft
and
its
about
the
same
with
1
per
oz
if
you
buy
in
the
bottle
mouthfeel
its
beyond
words
amazing
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
have
the
taste
is
very
lactic
acid
infused
with
a
saliva
starting
taste
up
front
with
some
lemon
and
greek
yogurt
like
tangy
flavors
with
a
slight
citurs
juiciness
and
mild
grain
tinge
in
the
back
with
interesting
spice
quality
and
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
super
sour
wild
beer
which
is
not
for
the
timid
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
considering
how
sour
it
is
though
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
simple
clean
sourness
although
its
more
acetic
than
anything
else
o
just
a
tad
too
sour
for
my
taste
although
it
does
remind
me
of
a
more
fruitforward
sour
like
a
flanders
red
i
also
was
hoping
for
more
rye
in
the
flavor
still
quite
drinkable
and
appropriate
for
the
style
o
overall
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
glad
i
have
more
of
these
in
the
cellar
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
awa
very
fruity
despite
the
lack
of
fruit
would
definitely
drink
this
again
sour
in
the
rye
is
very
very
impressive
beer
it
delivers
its
not
too
sour
not
too
funkyjust
right
it
features
a
rockin
flavor
profile
thats
deep
and
very
tasty
find
a
bottle
definitely
worth
seeking
out
the
beer
pours
an
amber
orange
with
syrupy
colors
and
a
nice
fingerwidth
head
of
creamy
tiny
bubbles
the
beers
body
is
clear
and
practically
crystal
clean
with
just
a
slight
haze
from
the
malt
and
yeast
the
beers
head
leaves
a
lacing
sticky
dots
and
strings
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
like
a
light
gueuze
with
beautiful
funk
and
cherry
leather
notes
and
a
faint
tinge
of
spice
the
smell
is
not
as
strong
as
a
gueuze
but
it
is
still
beautiful
and
funky
leather
is
definitely
the
dominant
smell
in
the
nose
but
it
is
paired
with
a
sweeter
funk
and
some
light
spicy
rye
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
funky
sweet
with
a
light
underlying
rye
spice
and
some
nice
acidity
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
fruity
funk
that
moves
into
distinguished
leather
notes
that
stick
to
the
tongue
and
only
give
light
hints
of
cherry
there
is
an
underlying
spice
from
the
rye
which
is
light
and
bready
but
i
honestly
cant
say
if
i
would
have
noticed
it
unless
the
beer
specifically
had
rye
in
the
name
the
funk
does
hit
almost
cloying
notes
as
it
builds
touching
citric
lemon
and
some
slight
pineapple
notes
in
the
start
of
the
taste
the
finish
is
sweet
lemon
citrus
with
a
touch
of
leather
and
then
a
final
burp
of
spicy
rye
with
a
faint
touch
of
bread
and
chocolate
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
medium
plus
in
body
with
a
creamy
carbonation
and
a
great
citric
pucker
at
the
end
without
the
citric
bite
this
beer
feels
really
nice
in
the
mouth
overall
this
beer
is
a
terrific
sour
with
a
great
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
bite
the
hell
out
of
your
mouth
with
acid
this
is
a
very
balanced
and
tasty
sour
try
this
beer
but
share
it
it
is
worth
the
money
o
610
sourness
very
tasty
sour
with
big
cherry
notes
sit
was
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
would
be
from
the
first
whiff
of
the
beer
but
very
smooth
i
just
wish
this
beer
was
about
5
cheaper
poured
into
bruery
snifter
appearance
is
a
reddish
orange
with
nice
clarity
and
significant
head
upon
pour
head
dissipates
to
a
collar
and
leaves
some
lacing
the
nose
is
complex
and
oaky
with
heavy
tart
fruit
notes
of
peach
and
cherries
along
with
a
touch
of
rye
malt
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
super
tart
from
start
to
finish
with
nice
underlying
fruit
and
oak
character
the
rye
is
subtle
but
adds
a
nice
complexity
to
the
sour
profile
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
with
medium
body
this
is
a
deliciously
sour
ale
and
definitely
worth
trying
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
sour
beer
at
heart
the
oak
and
rye
simply
smooth
out
the
rough
edges
and
wrap
it
all
up
in
a
neat
little
package
its
darkness
reminds
me
of
an
oud
bruin
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
with
a
punch
that
will
leave
you
reeling
be
warned
this
one
is
addictively
sour
oanother
stellar
sour
from
the
bruery
expensive
but
worth
a
try
an
interesting
ghost
flavor
of
the
malt
brew
this
used
to
be
before
the
bacteria
were
turned
loose
just
plain
sour
but
it
has
a
lingering
grainy
and
faintly
hoppy
taste
not
much
for
drinkability
o
this
one
definitely
makes
you
pucker
up
a
little
bit
from
the
tartnesssourness
but
yet
this
remains
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sour
beers
i
have
had
and
i
am
a
fan
of
sour
beers
there
is
a
great
complexity
of
the
flavors
in
the
sourness
i
found
this
one
real
easy
to
drink
but
i
needed
to
sip
it
o
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
for
a
sour
beer
but
is
pleasant
to
sip
o
another
great
sour
from
the
bruery
not
super
complex
but
quite
tasty
with
a
very
pleasant
aroma
i
use
this
site
often
but
rarely
review
beers
i
love
this
beer
overall
a
really
nice
sour
better
than
i
was
expecting
for
some
reason
probably
because
the
rye
wasnt
so
pronounced
and
there
was
a
ton
of
fruit
flavour
o
im
quite
mad
at
myself
i
picked
this
up
at
the
blue
dog
in
chalfont
and
this
has
been
on
their
tap
list
for
some
time
its
probably
done
now
had
i
known
id
of
stopped
every
day
after
work
and
had
2
or
more
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
and
i
will
certainly
be
ordering
this
whenever
and
wherever
i
can
o
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
sours
it
holds
up
really
well
against
the
more
wellknown
sours
from
producers
like
crooked
stave
and
nb
it
has
a
unique
fruity
flavor
profile
that
is
propped
up
by
an
excellent
malt
base
great
job
bruery
ill
be
purchasing
more
if
i
see
it
again
lots
of
tannic
grapeskin
in
the
taste
bracing
acidity
that
gets
the
salivary
glands
into
overdrive
fruity
and
sour
with
some
acetic
acid
and
malt
character
in
the
middle
dry
and
puckering
medium
bodied
with
balance
carbonation
overall
nice
to
try
though
not
overly
complex
it
fills
the
sour
fix
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
super
solid
sour
beer
just
dont
expect
very
much
in
the
rye
department
if
you
like
sour
beer
it
is
still
very
worth
a
shot
thanks
wisconsin
overall
a
really
enjoyable
and
tasty
sour
ale
from
the
bruery
it
is
really
nicely
balanced
and
the
fruit
notes
given
off
are
really
enjoyable
the
sourness
is
not
overdone
at
all
the
rye
doesnt
really
give
off
much
in
the
way
of
rye
spiciness
but
i
dont
really
miss
that
type
of
character
in
this
beer
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
really
tasty
overall
very
nice
very
little
rye
but
great
lambic
like
sour
fruit
and
tartness
good
funk
overall
juicy
fruit
light
barrel
notes
very
tasty
o
a
great
sour
brewed
without
the
addition
of
fruit
i
am
partial
to
the
sours
with
added
fruit
but
sour
in
the
rye
manages
to
impress
me
with
the
breadth
and
harmony
of
its
nuances
a
really
really
good
sour
beer
though
not
as
complex
or
nuanced
as
many
nor
priced
economically
i
paid
19
99
i
still
like
this
one
a
lot
but
after
half
a
bottle
ive
convinced
myself
to
not
get
another
bottle
anytime
soon
b
o
still
oude
tarte
is
the
one
to
beat
this
was
quite
good
and
worth
the
price
tag
over
not
sure
i
was
age
a
bunch
of
bottles
though
o
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
didnt
have
very
high
expectations
for
it
but
it
was
really
good
im
definitely
glad
that
i
picked
up
more
than
1
bottle
didnt
think
i
was
gonna
get
such
an
easy
second
chance
with
this
beer
much
less
on
tap
but
here
we
are
it
pours
a
hazy
amber
topped
by
a
couple
fingers
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
soft
cheese
tart
berries
light
wine
grapes
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
strong
semilactic
sourness
pervading
quite
nicely
its
strong
but
you
get
to
keep
some
of
your
enamel
if
you
do
things
right
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
nice
sour
though
im
unsure
whether
or
not
the
coriander
ahd
much
impact
if
any
just
sayin
good
times
though
would
recommend
overall
55
this
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
best
sour
ales
i
have
ever
had
perhaps
only
bested
by
the
bruerys
oude
tart
it
is
a
beer
to
seek
out
if
youre
into
the
sour
stuff
o
this
probably
the
second
most
sour
beer
i
have
ever
had
behind
motherfunker
but
that
is
a
good
thing
it
is
also
extremely
easy
to
drink
as
it
has
a
sweetness
to
balance
the
sour
to
make
it
like
candy
and
rye
to
make
those
flavors
all
balance
out
plus
the
feel
adds
to
it
overall
im
very
impressed
and
highly
recommend
despite
the
high
price
tag
in
some
markets
unreal
good
like
a
sour
rock
and
rye
killer
beer
i
need
a
solid
bruery
connection
because
of
beers
like
this
o
a
good
wild
ale
overall
a
bit
overpriced
and
not
terribly
complex
but
still
very
enjoyable
d
great
rye
and
sour
beer
great
complexity
and
balance
oexcellent
awa
great
balance
of
flavor
and
tartness
probably
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
to
see
what
a
little
age
does
to
them
o
this
was
a
great
beer
it
doesnt
blow
away
any
of
the
other
beers
the
bruery
puts
out
in
this
category
but
that
doesnt
make
it
top
notch
really
glad
i
grabbed
this
one
you
should
too
4
i
flat
out
loved
this
beer
its
really
sour
and
mouth
watering
with
great
flavor
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
fade
completely
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
heavy
amount
of
funk
and
tart
fruity
aromas
the
taste
is
very
big
lots
of
sour
fruity
flavors
followed
up
with
a
malty
rye
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
and
dry
nicely
carbonated
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
there
is
a
light
medicinal
taste
im
getting
the
more
it
sits
on
my
tongue
regardless
still
worthy
of
trying
o
its
quite
good
its
not
overly
sour
but
it
has
a
nice
pucker
to
it
good
flavors
and
a
solid
complexity
7
710
overall
very
good
the
rye
adds
a
dimension
to
the
base
sourness
that
works
well
not
overly
complex
but
quite
enjoyable
o
a
solid
sour
that
is
worth
the
price
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
the
rye
in
the
flavor
i
feel
this
is
as
good
as
the
sours
i
have
had
from
the
bruery
odreally
tasty
happy
to
get
this
on
tap
for
about
6
then
a
750ml
for
about
23
really
good
but
too
pricey
outside
of

with
a
moderately
lingering
tartness
overall
smells
amazing
and
has
a
nice
flavor
and
complexity
in
there
somewhere
underneath
the
sourness
but
it
was
tough
to
finish
a
10oz
pour
and
now
my
stomach
lining
is
being
eaten
away
othis
is
another
enjoyable
bruery
sour
beer
it
is
not
as
complex
or
impressive
as
oude
tart
but
it
provides
a
nice
punch
of
sour
with
a
reasonably
complex
and
integrated
flavor
i
also
find
it
to
be
a
good
looking
beer
i
dont
know
if
it
is
worth
22
but
i
would
drink
this
again
for
the
right
price
oone
of
the
best
wild
ales
ive
ever
had
the
quality
in
this
sort
of
ale
does
not
get
higher
tying
new
bruery
beers
is
such
a
joy
and
beers
like
this
remind
me
why
its
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
was
craving
a
wild
ale
and
this
beer
will
keep
me
satisfied
for
a
long
time
o
i
love
this
if
only
it
werent
so
damn
expensive
at
20
99
a
bottle
cheers
this
one
is
really
really
sour
and
i
like
it
a
lot
the
pour
is
cloudy
and
orange
looking
more
like
funky
soda
than
beer
with
its
huge
bubbles
rushing
to
the
surface
and
fizzy
white
head
the
nose
is
pungently
sour
holy
cow
wow
i
dont
smell
hardly
any
rye
malt
or
really
anything
much
but
lacto
acidic
sourness
and
tangerines
a
funny
combo
for
a
beer
i
expected
to
be
far
more
woody
the
taste
is
also
sour
all
the
way
through
but
there
is
a
dab
of
rye
spice
right
in
the
middle
which
makes
for
a
unique
sensation
in
the
mouth
my
roommate
jeff
described
it
as
a
mega
sour
warhead
candy
which
isnt
that
far
off
there
is
also
a
ton
of
fruit
to
the
finish
of
this
not
sweet
at
all
but
almost
like
if
sour
patch
kids
were
made
from
real
fruit
like
cranberries
and
oranges
tart
and
sour
at
the
same
time
not
as
bretty
or
oaky
as
it
might
have
been
but
the
sour
lingers
on
long
after
the
beer
is
swallowed
this
one
came
across
a
little
sloppy
to
me
compared
to
say
the
white
oak
or
the
smoking
wood
which
to
me
are
calculated
masterfully
this
is
a
bit
more
hodgepodged
but
it
ends
up
being
a
pretty
tasty
final
product
dry
in
feel
medium
in
body
excessively
carbonated
all
up
this
is
something
very
unconventional
and
if
you
like
sours
give
it
a
shot
price
point
is
brutal
though
being
over
20
bucks
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
american
wild
i
am
usually
a
fan
of
funky
sours
but
this
does
a
good
job
balancing
the
sourness
with
other
flavors
like
oak
and
vanilla
if
you
like
sours
this
is
definitely
one
to
pick
up
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
and
tart
the
brew
smells
like
lemon
peaches
oak
some
funk
and
an
overall
tart
fruity
aroma
the
brew
tastes
like
lemon
sour
cherries
peaches
apricots
and
some
vinegar
vanilla
and
oak
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
dont
pick
up
any
rye
in
this
beer
but
maybe
its
overpowered
by
the
tartsourness
thats
in
it
i
think
its
a
good
sour
brew
id
like
to
try
this
again
its
pricey
at
19
99
a
bottle
but
id
buy
it
again
definitely
worth
trying
overall
good
sour
from
the
bruery
though
as
is
the
case
with
a
lot
of
their
beers
the
price
tag
21
99
will
make
it
difficult
to
justify
a
repeat
purchase
overall
i
would
like
to
see
something
more
in
the
middle
with
this
beer
to
balance
out
the
acetic
tartness
but
i
suspect
many
sour
lovers
would
disagree
as
it
certainly
hit
the
hot
buttons
for
a
tongue
assault
murky
auburn
capped
with
some
patchy
white
foam
that
dissolves
to
pretty
much
nothing
tart
dusty
fruit
aroma
berries
sweet
cherries
vinous
notes
ripe
fruit
light
citrus
more
floral
as
it
warms
super
sour
acidic
tartness
lactic
notes
fruit
mild
lemon
and
cherry
juice
no
rye
anywhere
as
far
as
i
can
tell
very
dry
and
tart
not
the
most
complex
sour
but
quite
enjoyable
kind
of
flanders
sourish
overall
its
not
particularly
complex
brew
but
a
solid
fruit
bodied
sour
beer
i
wish
i
could
say
more
about
it
but
unfortunately
thats
about
all
there
is
oh
my
the
bruery
has
knock
it
out
of
the
park
this
beer
gets
started
from
its
sexy
looks
then
draws
you
near
with
its
insanely
amazing
odors
then
you
actually
get
to
drinking
it
and
i
have
never
tasted
a
beer
that
so
completely
encompasses
your
entire
mouth
from
front
to
back
this
little
bad
boy
reels
you
in
i
have
never
tasted
a
midsection
so
complete
and
mind
blowing
from
its
parts
that
are
amiable
and
tender
like
a
cider
to
that
last
little
note
of
twangieness
flexing
that
tiny
muscle
under
your
jaw
bone
this
bitch
comes
through
like
clutch
free
throw
shooter
being
giving
the
ball
in
the
last
seconds
of
the
game
you
know
they
are
going
to
foul
but
you
know
those
points
are
as
good
as
already
on
the
board
have
had
this
in
multiple
variations
year
to
year
on
tap
etc
and
theyve
always
been
good
and
consistent
very
good
one
of
my
favorites
cant
wait
to
try
the
peaches
version
the
price
of
19
99
is
also
way
too
high
to
pay
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
it
has
to
be
a
solid
5
0
for
that
price
cantillon
is
deserving
of
it
the
bruery
is
not
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
better
sours
they
produce
in
my
humble
opinion
o
a
nice
sour
overall
has
great
fruity
and
tart
flavors
and
is
very
drinkable
i
finished
the
bottle
with
little
difficulty
this
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
cigar
city
snifter
the
pour
is
hazy
orange
light
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sour
apples
apple
cider
vinegar
the
beer
is
acidic
tart
vinegary
lots
of
green
apple
notes
drying
finish
the
body
is
light
carbonation
medium
a
solid
sour
i
did
not
pick
up
much
of
the
rye
o
one
of
the
more
impressive
sours
i
have
had
recently
still
trying
to
wrap
my
head
around
the
peach
aromas
and
flavors
i
am
picking
up
in
this
one
fantastic
beer
o
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
are
nice
the
beer
needs
at
least
double
the
carbonation
very
unique
brew
worth
25750ml
recommended
even
at
that
price
point
good
bit
of
sourness
on
this
one
unleashes
a
plethora
of
soured
stone
fruits
very
dry
finish
from
the
oak
aging
hints
of
chestnuts
and
vinegar
the
bruery
is
really
getting
their
sour
game
on
i
always
held
off
on
reviewing
this
one
because
i
didnt
actually
believe
it
was
as
good
as
i
thought
it
was
i
wanted
to
sit
down
with
a
full
glass
of
this
beer
and
really
contemplate
it
before
giving
it
such
high
marks
a
year
after
release
im
finally
doing
just
that
and
this
beer
is
exceptional
its
one
of
my
favorite
american
sours
i
suppose
if
i
had
to
find
a
flaw
id
want
more
funk
but
the
flavors
that
are
here
are
just
too
extraordinary
to
worry
about
complaining
about
anything
pours
a
really
attractive
deep
gold
frothy
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
or
head
the
initial
smell
is
of
apricots
and
sour
mash
the
apricot
smell
weakens
as
it
warms
tastes
exactly
as
it
smells
slightly
funky
with
a
bit
of
apricot
i
can
barely
detect
the
oak
the
rye
is
also
faint
mouthfeel
is
medium
i
really
enjoyed
this
sour
and
look
forward
to
getting
more
o
a
pleasant
enjoyable
and
balanced
sour
something
i
would
call
an
everyday
sour
boy
the
wife
loved
it
too
good
beer
fairly
standard
issue
stuff
a
pretty
good
brew
id
have
liked
the
rye
to
see
its
shadow
more
than
it
does
can
a
brewery
please
make
sours
with
some
other
tastes
in
them
that
would
great
kthxbye
o
another
solid
wild
ale
from
the
bruery
o
one
of
the
more
unique
wild
ales
i
have
had
recently
almost
reminds
me
of
a
flanders
but
cleaner
and
far
spicier
minus
the
deeper
fruits
you
can
get
very
fun
and
unique
m
medium
bodied
nice
coating
of
sourness
o
sour
subtle
wood
and
rye
bread
very
nice
fairly
simple
beer
very
good
though
the
light
fruit
element
works
well
pours
dark
amber
with
a
very
thin
white
head
nice
aromas
of
brown
sugar
and
toffee
balsamic
vinegar
cherries
rye
malt
and
oak
similar
to
the
nose
lots
of
sweet
and
spicy
rye
red
wine
vinegar
oak
currants
and
cranberries
kinda
reminds
me
of
oude
tart
but
with
rye
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slick
with
a
medium
body
and
fairly
low
carbonation
another
nice
bruery
sour
the
rye
addition
is
quite
nice
overall
an
incredible
wild
ale
get
many
if
you
can
o
overall
slightly
more
lactic
than
i
like
in
an
american
wild
but
very
good
otherwise
there
is
a
good
butterscotch
presence
as
it
warms
a
good
caramel
and
toffee
presence
and
other
than
that
may
finish
slightly
syrupy
and
a
little
sweet
on
the
negative
side
d
aroma
was
overall
a
bit
better
than
the
taste
just
not
ambitious
enough
and
a
little
too
single
note
in
the
sourness
worth
a
try
though
another
nice
sour
from
the
bruery
though
i
do
prefer
mother
funker
o
definitely
brings
something
different
to
the
sour
arena
while
it
isnt
my
favorite
sour
or
even
favorite
sour
from
the
bruery
i
can
appreciate
that
they
were
doing
something
a
bit
different
with
this
one
hold
your
stash
as
this
is
a
reasonable
way
from
peak
pours
an
absolutely
beautiful
clear
deep
amber
with
a
bright
white
heads
that
slowly
dissipates
aroma
is
sour
lactic
acid
green
apples
light
oak
and
a
nice
sweet
and
spicy
grainy
scent
wow
a
beautifully
balanced
wild
ale
the
flavor
is
just
perfect
it
starts
a
bit
slow
with
a
bit
of
funk
and
oak
but
throughout
the
swallow
the
lactic
sour
washes
through
and
finishes
very
nice
and
dry
this
is
really
well
done
the
rye
lends
a
very
subtle
touch
of
spice
and
stays
in
the
background
but
is
a
welcome
addition
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
full
for
a
sour
but
certainly
doesnt
detract
carbonation
is
spot
on
overall
this
is
a
home
run
for
me
very
nicely
done
overall
this
beer
would
be
something
i
would
drink
often
but
unfortunately
it
doesnt
make
it
out
to
these
areas
the
addition
of
rye
to
this
sour
beer
really
imparts
a
new
dimension
smoothness
in
the
feel
helps
bring
out
the
flavors
well
still
though
a
bit
overthetop
sour
for
me
with
a
touch
too
much
vinegar
a
decent
beer
overall
but
a
bit
lacking
in
the
balanceflavor
department
an
initial
sweetness
greets
the
palate
with
juicy
fruit
notes
of
white
grape
rind
and
peach
before
quickly
giving
way
to
a
lightly
puckering
tartness
decadent
and
sour
but
not
enough
to
wear
away
at
the
palate
instead
this
drinks
amazingly
well
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
gentle
carbonation
level
finishes
dry
with
notes
of
vinegar
and
fresh
oaky
wood
i
must
admit
the
bruery
is
absolutely
killing
the
sourwild
ale
category
as
of
late
chalk
sour
in
the
rye
up
as
another
clearcut
winner
3
5
d
tasty
beer
and
nothing
quite
like
it
ill
enjoy
my
other
two
bottles
overall
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
the
sourness
is
middle
of
the
road
the
rye
is
also
not
overdone
but
definitely
makes
its
presence
know
all
the
key
flavor
components
are
perfectly
in
balance
and
make
for
a
super
solid
american
wild
ale
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
as
my
sparse
words
show
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
it
solid
sour
with
a
good
contrast
from
the
rye
not
bad
but
not
exceptional
either
sour
in
the
rye
pours
a
relatively
hazy
amber
with
prominent
burnt
orange
highlights
the
bone
colored
foam
pillows
up
to
three
fingers
in
height
before
displaying
a
surprising
amount
of
head
retention
and
lacing
for
a
wild
ale
the
nose
is
reminiscent
of
a
flanders
red
theres
plenty
of
cherry
led
dark
fruits
oak
and
acidic
tartness
no
real
contribution
from
the
rye
here
the
flavor
profile
does
make
room
for
some
spicy
earthy
rye
notes
to
emerge
in
the
background
complementing
the
woodiness
from
the
barrels
the
sour
aspect
of
the
beer
is
a
little
more
overpowering
here
not
leaving
as
much
room
for
some
of
the
fruit
flavors
to
shine
through
the
body
is
a
little
creamier
than
normal
for
the
style
while
still
being
fairly
dry
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
bubbly
creating
an
interesting
contrast
with
the
body
while
i
wish
the
rye
used
for
sour
in
the
rye
stood
out
some
more
at
times
it
still
helps
the
bruery
make
a
very
good
wild
ale
with
a
bit
of
a
unique
twist
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
slight
viscous
feel
to
it
from
the
rye
inclusion
the
alcohol
is
felt
with
a
slight
warmth
and
accenting
fruity
ester
that
is
very
well
balanced
you
can
actually
see
how
this
brew
is
thicker
than
the
norm
with
how
the
rising
bubbles
of
carbonation
have
a
hard
time
rising
to
the
surface
and
do
so
very
slowly
i
will
admit
that
i
took
a
peek
at
the
previous
scores
to
this
brew
prior
to
trying
it
i
was
pleasantly
taken
back
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
anyone
who
was
disappointed
in
this
can
gladly
forward
me
any
bottles
that
they
purchased
that
they
now
regret
having
i
think
this
is
fantastic
batch
1
seems
better
than
batch
2
but
i
wouldnt
particular
seek
out
either
again
pours
a
murky
dark
gold
with
a
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
thin
streaks
of
lace
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
all
kinds
of
funky
sour
and
tart
with
a
nice
fruity
presence
as
well
taste
is
outstanding
and
is
a
perfect
translation
of
the
smell
made
better
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
excellent
sour
that
is
just
super
tasty
and
super
easy
to
drink
2012
vintage
pours
an
orangishamber
color
that
is
very
hazy
and
has
a
mediumlarge
white
head
that
diminishes
rather
quickly
scent
is
quite
lovely
smells
like
some
fresh
rye
bread
with
some
sour
yeastiness
spiciness
perfectly
blended
with
sour
wild
yeast
notes
and
barnyard
funk
some
nice
hoppiness
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
just
as
good
as
it
smells
i
was
kinda
nervous
going
into
this
one
due
to
the
mixed
reviews
but
damn
this
is
good
perfect
mix
of
rye
bread
and
lacto
flavors
some
white
vinegar
with
fresh
baked
bread
and
bitter
hops
the
rye
makes
this
beer
have
some
spiciness
after
you
get
the
tartness
up
front
but
then
it
finishes
sour
very
complex
mouthfeel
is
very
wellcarbonated
and
medium
bodied
puckering
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
that
i
wish
i
was
allowed
to
purchase
more
of
i
was
only
allowed
three
bottles
but
would
gladly
purchase
more
d
this
was
a
fantastic
sour
with
bold
but
delicate
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
great
too
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
but
the
finish
was
really
intense
so
it
must
be
sipped
would
age
a
very
long
time
but
is
already
great
fresh
recommended
o
not
a
bad
offering
very
curious
to
see
how
thing
one
progresses
with
age
medium
bodied
but
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
with
a
balance
of
oak
funk
spice
rye
dark
fruit
and
sweet
malt
slightly
tart
and
puckering
but
more
funky
than
sour
theres
more
acetone
than
the
nose
suggests
but
it
isnt
too
overpowering
or
vinegary
dry
toasted
oak
and
lots
rye
flavor
this
beer
would
probably
be
terrible
if
it
wasnt
for
the
rye
but
it
counters
the
funk
and
acetone
with
a
nice
sweet
and
spicy
character
this
is
complimented
by
some
dark
fruit
and
sweet
malt
finishes
dry
and
tart
with
a
touch
more
acetone
overall
well
balanced
and
flavorful
but
the
acetone
turns
a
beer
that
could
be
amazing
into
slightly
above
average
o
this
is
not
a
good
beer
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
overpowering
rye
did
not
make
this
drinkable
at
all
we
had
quite
a
few
beers
to
get
to
and
i
didnt
want
to
waste
my
time
or
my
palate
on
this
train
wreck
it
went
down
the
drain
overall
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
one
it
is
very
one
dimensional
and
i
find
the
rye
to
be
odd
rating
95
out
of
100
appearance
is
a
cloudy
orange
tone
with
a
short
white
head
kind
of
like
part
of
some
sunsets
its
nose
has
cherry
sour
apples
and
yeast
present
there
is
tartness
there
no
question
about
it
it
tastes
of
oak
spice
more
of
those
fruits
and
more
of
that
tart
aspect
to
it
mouthfeel
is
at
a
medium
level
fair
carbonation
level
an
interesting
sour
from
the
bruery
and
a
pretty
damn
good
one
im
going
to
throw
this
out
there
and
i
dont
say
this
lightly
sour
in
the
rye
is
my
favorite
bruery
beer
the
balance
of
spicy
rye
malt
tart
bacteria
and
oak
is
just
perfect
like
i
said
i
finished
the
whole
bottle
myself
and
id
do
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
glorious
stuff
overall
very
tasty
very
drinkable
the
sour
beer
and
the
spice
from
the
rye
play
well
together
very
well
balanced
bottle
from
hopscotch
pucker
up
and
get
ready
for
a
wild
ride
this
beer
is
full
of
awesome
sourness
first
i
didnt
taste
or
smell
any
rye
but
i
didnt
care
from
nose
to
mouth
i
would
say
it
was
like
sour
tasting
pop
rocks
in
your
mouth
the
higher
abv
really
helped
give
this
beer
some
extra
body
but
without
the
booze
taste
this
is
a
top
3
american
made
sour
and
i
would
love
to
have
another
bottle
decent
enough
though
a
bit
of
an
underperformer
a
little
more
contrast
would
work
wonders
o
great
stuff
and
finally
a
good
use
of
a
newly
overused
grain
very
interesting
the
texture
is
something
completely
else
luckily
i
knew
what
to
expect
from
the
rye
but
it
certainly
threw
my
wife
for
a
loop
she
really
likes
light
bodied
lambics
and
so
this
beer
definitely
doesnt
really
appeal
to
here
i
am
definitely
enjoying
this
beer
if
for
nothing
else
than
its
unique
texture
then
so
be
it
there
isnt
really
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
here
i
would
have
expected
that
the
rye
would
have
added
more
wild
graininess
and
spiciness
to
this
brew
and
even
the
funkiness
is
focused
on
the
lactic
acidity
rather
than
more
wild
notes
from
brettanomyces
or
other
wildbugs
that
can
produce
a
lot
of
off
flavors
if
there
were
a
lot
of
sour
heavily
laden
rye
beers
out
there
this
wouldnt
be
much
of
a
standout
but
as
it
is
there
is
not
so
this
is
enjoyable
for
its
relative
uniqueness
if
nothing
else
it
is
indeed
an
experience
i
guess
the
majority
of
ba
must
really
like
drinking
salad
dressing
or
its
the
rarity
hard
to
tell
ultimately
this
beer
is
just
overdone
like
nobodys
business
drinking
a
whole
bottle
is
nigh
on
impossible
im
going
to
have
to
make
a
salad
dressing
or
something
with
this
i
would
not
age
this
any
longer
as
at
this
point
my
bottle
is
already
a
lot
more
sourer
than
an
of
the
cc
la
folies
ive
had
this
seems
like
a
recent
development
as
some
of
the
early
reviews
mention
balance
low
sourness
neither
of
which
are
evident
from
this
sample
pours
a
orangish
brown
a
touch
of
white
head
looks
fairly
pretty
smells
spicy
and
tart
not
particularly
sour
on
the
nose
or
tongue
there
is
a
spicy
and
sour
burn
that
is
really
interesting
tons
of
rye
on
the
tongue
that
combines
nicely
with
nose
fairly
thick
pn
the
tongue
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sours
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
nice
balance
with
the
sourness
and
the
rye
malt
o
good
sour
but
i
really
hope
that
the
bruery
crew
can
figure
out
a
way
to
cut
back
on
the
acetic
qualities
in
their
sours
these
are
all
a
beers
but
for
the
vinegar
notestaste
maybe
its
the
oc
water
aroma
is
loaded
with
fruit
pears
are
dominant
as
much
as
you
would
say
blueberries
are
in
blabaer
this
has
the
most
pronounced
pear
aroma
and
flavor
i
have
ever
come
across
light
tartness
builds
as
it
comes
up
to
room
temperature
giving
you
that
horse
funk
you
are
looking
for
but
keeping
it
light
with
tons
of
light
grain
and
bready
notes
back
building
the
pear
and
now
light
sour
apple
each
sip
seems
to
get
even
more
complex
then
the
one
before
rich
pear
and
apple
flavors
light
sour
notes
hints
of
grass
and
liht
bready
malts
complex
as
hell
perfect
carbonation
light
bubbly
full
enough
to
coat
the
tonue
perfectly
done
with
the
abv
so
well
hidden
i
thought
it
was
8
percent
shared
this
one
with
the
group
at
the
evening
wood
tasting
graciously
hosted
by
cmrillo
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
hazy
redorange
with
a
very
minimal
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
and
acetic
acid
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
funk
and
vinegar
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
just
plain
excellent
it
was
also
a
really
big
hit
with
the
other
who
were
tasting
it
as
well
the
look
of
this
brew
isnt
that
nice
but
it
definitely
made
up
for
this
fact
with
the
flavor
and
aroma
without
a
doubt
really
wish
i
could
have
gotten
multiple
bottles
of
this
from
the
reserve
society
this
year
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
share
this
one
with
quite
a
few
good
bas
and
others
who
appreciated
it
definitely
worth
your
time
to
try
or
trade
for
i
knew
i
needed
to
try
this
beer
as
soon
as
i
heard
about
it
i
love
the
bruery
and
catcher
in
the
rye
pretty
murky
beer
very
dark
amber
brown
with
a
reddish
hugh
not
such
great
head
retention
just
not
the
best
looking
beer
strong
aroma
of
dry
oak
and
vinegar
very
vinous
a
very
nice
aroma
with
some
grape
skins
and
hints
of
sweet
rye
rye
yup
its
there
in
the
flavor
but
plenty
more
oak
and
vinous
notes
a
bit
sharp
and
biting
with
a
great
lactic
sour
character
my
only
critique
is
that
this
beer
could
have
more
depth
and
complexity
dry
period
just
a
great
beer
i
love
bruery
sours
and
this
does
not
disappoint
plus
the
bottle
is
awesome
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
although
not
spectacular
its
sour
enough
that
it
makes
it
hard
to
drink
tons
of
but
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
and
i
could
drink
it
again
o
not
fantastic
nor
horrible
but
it
is
certainly
not
something
i
would
seek
out
very
similar
to
cigar
citys
vuja
de
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
any
time
i
have
the
opportunity
to
try
a
new
sour
wild
ale
its
pretty
exciting
this
one
delivered
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
sour
from
the
bruery
nose
is
pretty
sour
and
funky
and
lots
of
brett
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
would
really
like
to
see
this
with
sour
cherries
similar
to
ot
o
one
4oz
sample
is
enough
for
me
here
this
beer
is
dare
i
say
it
too
acetic
for
me
to
enjoy
all
that
much
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
a
little
overthetop
decent
the
rye
is
a
cool
choice
for
this
beer
it
is
interesting
and
very
nice
bright
mild
acetic
sourness
lots
of
woody
brettanomyces
character
in
there
really
nice
sour
funky
beer
from
the
bruery
sounds
like
having
this
ontap
remedies
some
of
the
issues
i
had
with
this
one
would
like
to
try
a
glass
at
the
bruery
some
day
bottle
from
our
rs
membership
dark
hazy
orange
pour
no
carbonation
and
an
aroma
of
acidic
sour
apples
flavor
is
tart
right
off
the
the
bat
then
mellowed
into
creamy
malt
and
berries
with
a
good
balanced
aftertaste
this
was
a
really
outstanding
beer
o
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
so
sour
so
pleasantly
sweet
on
the
nose
and
just
right
in
the
abv
realm
one
of
the
best
bruery
creations
yet
overall
i
would
like
to
have
this
on
draft
and
see
what
the
differences
are
i
would
of
also
liked
to
try
the
first
batch
of
this
since
the
reviews
are
higher
from
the
2009
run
the
beer
drinks
well
enough
it
doesnt
wow
me
but
it
isnt
bad
either
overall
admittedly
i
am
not
that
into
sours
but
i
have
been
sampling
more
lately
and
doing
a
bit
of
dabbling
in
them
when
given
the
chance
they
were
pouring
this
from
the
draft
at
this
tasting
but
later
when
that
small
keg
ran
out
they
switched
over
to
a
few
bottles
they
had
for
my
palate
i
greatly
preferred
the
keg
as
the
bottle
was
more
sour
and
tart
and
the
oak
and
bourbon
backbone
was
pretty
faint
in
contrast
to
what
was
coming
through
on
tap
not
sure
as
to
why
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
from
my
rs
membership
not
sure
what
to
do
with
it
yet
patrick
tyler
et
al
continue
to
produce
some
of
the
tastiest
stuff
around
i
found
it
one
of
those
beers
that
clearly
remind
you
how
important
serving
temperature
is
when
i
first
started
drinking
it
a
bit
under
temperature
i
found
the
vinegar
to
be
overwhelming
and
found
it
to
be
harsh
with
just
a
hint
of
rye
at
the
proper
temperature
the
acetic
citrus
and
rye
notes
appear
balanced
a
slow
but
easy
drinker
maybe
not
an
introductory
sour
but
certainly
not
advanced
another
reviewer
compared
it
to
an
oud
bruin
and
i
concur
thats
probably
its
proper
category
this
is
pretty
damn
solid
really
nice
flavor
profiles
however
cant
tell
there
is
rye
at
all
the
tart
vinegar
is
a
little
coy
on
the
taste
other
than
that
almost
perfect
d
ok
after
these
three
beers
the
other
two
being
chocolate
rain
and
bba
two
turtle
doves
i
am
officially
a
fan
of
the
bruery
i
had
been
on
the
fence
before
but
no
longer
amazing
stuff
this
is
such
an
awesome
tasty
sour
beer
definitely
one
of
the
best
american
sours
ive
had
to
date
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
american
wild
and
a
750
goes
down
pretty
easy
with
12
other
people
finishing
an
entire
bottle
by
yourself
might
be
a
bit
rough
though
this
beer
is
already
quite
acidic
but
i
would
be
interested
in
seeing
how
it
ages
and
if
the
brett
comes
out
more
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
the
rye
spice
blue
cheese
combo
is
pretty
cool
overall
a
really
nice
sour
the
rye
adds
an
awesome
layer
to
the
sour
pretty
drinkable
murky
orangeamber
nearly
opaque
the
head
fizzles
away
quickly
interesting
complex
nose
rye
is
evident
lending
a
dry
earthy
note
but
theres
a
more
dominant
fruity
vinous
sourness
thats
both
acetic
and
lactic
the
palate
shows
a
nice
blend
of
cheesy
lactic
acidity
fruity
acetic
acid
earthy
rye
and
oak
balanced
but
somewhat
thin
for
nearly
9
abv
quite
good
overall
the
rye
contrasts
nicely
with
the
bugs
and
funk
poured
a
caramel
in
color
with
light
brown
highlights
that
had
a
thin
bubbly
head
and
left
some
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
i
did
detect
a
little
rye
but
was
faint
chillin
in
the
background
with
citrusy
vinegar
notes
vinous
character
and
faint
vanilla
as
well
the
citrusy
vinous
and
mild
vinegar
flavors
dominate
the
palate
with
rye
spice
oaky
and
grape
accents
with
a
touch
of
acidic
sour
notes
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
pleasent
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
mild
acidic
but
vinous
rye
spice
oakyand
citrusy
sour
finish
i
got
to
try
it
about
a
year
ago
but
was
happy
to
have
another
stab
at
it
since
i
thought
it
was
tasty
the
first
time
around
it
was
pretty
sour
and
drank
really
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
juxtaposition
between
sour
and
sweet
bourbon
like
flavors
is
amazing
drinkthis
is
a
great
sour
overall
for
me
because
its
not
too
over
the
top
unfortunately
the
complex
taste
does
wear
a
bit
compared
to
other
sours
i
did
not
come
back
for
a
second
but
probably
could
have
and
not
been
disappointed
again
some
age
would
probably
cut
down
on
this
a
lot
with
a
sacrifice
to
the
intense
mouthfeel
which
i
love
moderate
body
with
a
really
nice
amount
of
sourness
overall
this
drinks
quite
well
and
i
was
really
thrilled
to
be
able
to
try
this
this
trip
was
some
of
my
first
exposure
to
the
bruerys
beers
and
im
glad
that
they
have
nice
experimental
brews
like
this
on
d
a
little
too
tart
for
my
taste
well
this
certainly
brought
the
goods
with
a
hearty
even
mix
of
tartsourspicebread
notes
and
a
well
done
barrel
character
that
pulled
it
all
together
great
stuff
as
usual
from
the
bruery
the
flavor
opens
up
piquant
with
a
distinct
lemon
rind
and
cherry
tartness
as
well
as
a
clean
lactic
sourness
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
spicy
rye
is
well
integrated
and
i
detect
an
earthy
component
acetic
character
is
at
a
moderate
level
and
i
experience
that
same
sharp
blue
cheese
character
i
detected
in
the
nose
the
drying
finish
is
lactic
with
a
moderate
acetic
character
accompanied
by
light
wood
and
tannins
another
delicious
and
unique
beer
from
the
bruery
and
im
surprised
it
wasnt
better
received
on
the
forums
recommended
i
found
this
beer
to
be
great
drinkable
is
a
term
that
you
can
use
easily
with
this
i
went
back
not
only
for
seconds
but
fourths
this
should
be
bottled
and
distributed
directly
to
my
beer
room
whadda
you
think
patrick
no
ok
i
will
just
wait
for
it
to
be
put
on
tap
again
d
high
for
the
style
benefiting
from
the
sourness
not
being
overthetop
this
is
a
great
sour
overall
insanely
drinkable
absolutely
perfectly
balanced
nice
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
they
refused
to
give
me
a
growler
of
it
an
example
of
why
the
bruery
has
such
a
good
reputation
there
are
probably
less
than
half
a
dozen
breweries
in
the
country
that
can
do
sours
this
well
this
is
just
good
beer
which
is
underrated
at
the
moment
low
to
moderate
carbonation
just
a
tad
syrupy
for
my
liking
quite
an
interesting
sour
thats
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
great
sour
beer
the
2nd
time
ive
had
this
one
always
enjoyable
and
an
experience
an
interesting
sour
its
tartnesssoruness
would
be
in
the
middle
ground
for
the
style
hints
of
grapes
and
pinneapple
show
up
quite
cheesy
like
swiss
cheese
surprisngly
full
in
the
body
while
not
having
the
high
acidic
qualities
of
a
sour
cheesy
aftertaste
another
worthy
wild
ale
produced
by
the

feel
as
well
this
is
a
special
beer
for
anyone
who
enjoys
kriek
but

drier
more
tart

and
definitely
for
those
who
like

this
is
a
perfect
example
of
how
the
proper
additives
can
really
kick
a
good
beer
to
great
status
certainly
adding
sour
cherries
to
a
beer
with
sour
characteristics
is
nothing
new
but
the
bruery
has
definitely
added
their
own
stamp
to
the
idea
o
ill
still
be
tasting
cherries
tomorrow
thanks
fabulous

wow
very
nice
certainly
a
must
if
you
like
the
wilds
or
sours
or
flanders
i
really
enjoyed
this
tart
and
cherries
as
advertised
of
course
o
i
am
already
a
big
fan
of
the
base
beer
but
the
addition
of
cherries
really
adds
an
extra
layer
of
complexity
and
dimension
making
this
something
really
special
overall
really
glad
i
got
this
one
in
a
trade
wow
was
it
a
great
flemish
pours
a
nice
reddish
dark
beer
little
foam
is
formed
aroma
is
of
sour
beer
bretts
and
a
hint
of
cherries
taste
is
almost
identical
to
the
regular
oude
tart
i
wasnt
able
to
taste
the
cherries
at
all
if
it
comes
around
ill
give
it
a
try
again
the
beer
pours
a
dull
dark
brown
highlighted
by
hues
of
garnet
in
the
light
a
thin
fizzling
halo
of
offwhite
head
and
no
sediment
the
nose
has
molasses
sweetness
touched
by
cherry
upfront
thats
followed
by
oak
some
acetone
and
a
slightly
poopy
fart
a
similar
molasses
sweetness
washes
over
the
palate
in
the
beers
taste
and
transitions
into
subtle
tart
cherries
and
modest
oak
the
beer
has
a
heavymedium
chewy
body
with
minimal
carbonation
or
alcohol
palate
coating
and
mildly
abrasive
cherries
and
oak
and
a
dry
tannic
finish
this
beer
is
big
and
flavorful
the
cherries
have
faded
some
but
very
drinkable
and
relatively
balanced
a
clear
loser
compare
to
the
simple
great
base
this
is
wonderful
beer
it
really
is
but
im
not
sure
how
much
the
cherries
really
add
to
it
i
mean
the
original
beer
has
a
lot
of
tart
cherry
notes
in
it
already
but
remains
balanced
and
rather
true
to
the
flemish
red
tradition
this
edition
actually
has
cherries
in
it
and
while
they
get
lost
a
bit
in
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
they
give
it
a
gritty
sort
of
sweetness
before
the
acid
attack
on
the
back
end
deep
ruby
red
in
color
with
a
ton
of
bubbles
no
problems
there
the
nose
is
sour
but
doesnt
show
nearly
the
intensity
of
it
that
is
about
to
follow
the
cherries
add
a
nice
layer
to
the
smell
tart
and
familiar
but
they
come
through
a
bit
sweeter
in
the
taste
at
first
nice
sour
red
base
on
the
first
sip
but
ive
oude
tart
enough
to
know
that
its
about
to
get
gnarly
the
sourness
here
is
perhaps
the
most
of
any
beer
i
have
ever
had
in
fact
im
pretty
sure
it
is
it
almost
hurts
my
jaw
just
smelling
it
the
flavors
are
awesome
for
the
first
few
sips
and
i
get
a
nice
earthiness
that
comes
along
with
all
the
cherry
but
after
about
half
a
glass
i
cant
really
taste
it
much
anymore
certainly
not
as
well
because
my
taste
buds
have
been
basically
scorched
off
my
tongue
by
all
the
acid
im
not
complaining
i
like
that
but
i
could
never
take
down
a
bottle
of
this
without
help
it
would
turn
my
guts
inside
out
for
sure
the
carbonation
is
high
which
amplifies
the
sourness
to
even
a
higher
degree
i
love
this
beer
but
i
may
like
the
base
beer
better
than
the
cherry
version
it
just
doesnt
really
need
them
served
alongside
oude
tart
similar
appearance
to
the
standard
version
russet
to
ruby
hued
with
a
fizzy
beige
collar
lots
of
sour
cherries
and
oak
with
ample
funk
presence
piquant
and
intense
sour
cherries
take
center
stage
puckering
finish
with
a
drying
oak
presence
medium
bodied
and
palate
coating
delicious
the
taste
is
superb
very
interesting
how
it
develops
with
some
layered
stone
fruit
tanginess
and
acidity
in
the
taste
with
fruit
skin
and
slight
balsamic
sour
woody
combination
of
flavor
with
light
vanilla
and
alcohol
with
lasting
acidic
dry
finish
there
is
a
complexity
and
yet
drinkable
quality
in
this
unrivaled
in
many
sour
ales
fruity
and
unique
i
cant
say
for
sure
i
would
want
to
down
a
whole
bottle
to
myself
but
then
again
i
would
really
well
balanced
sour
the
cherries
are
sweet
enough
to
really
balance
out
the
oude
tart
base
which
can
be
too
vinegar
sour
for
me
at
times
dark
ruby
body
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
scent
with
tart
pie
cherries
which
is
very
nice
the
taste
is
almost
exactly
the
same
just
enough
cherry
to
give
you
that
tart
fruit
character
but
the
base
beer
still
shines
excellent
and
an
upgrade
from
the
oude
tart
base
beer
when
i
thought
i
had
had
i
true
sour
beer
from
the
bruery
this
comes
along
what
an
intense
fruity
acetic
monster
of
a
beer
definitely
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
in
the
realm
of
american
sour
ales
and
in
spite
of
its
overthetop
intensity
its
got
a
lot
going
for
it
and
makes
a
good
sipper
throughout
its
not
the
most
practical
sour
ive
had
but
the
fruit
characteristic
as
well
as
the
intense
oak
is
notable
in
its
class
i
dont
know
if
ill
ever
get
to
try
other
fruit
infused
sours
from
the
bruery
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
an
outstanding
beer
deliciously
sour
but
layered
and
nuanced
it
takes
some
time
to
pinpoint
all
of
the
subtleties
which
are
many
o
very
nice
sour
beer
as
much
as
i
enjoy
the
regular
version
of
oude
tart
this
is
a
notch
above
it
cherries
accompany
the
beer
quite
well
and
add
some
additional
complexity
not
sure
what
the
price
tag
is
on
this
one
but
i
doubt
id
buy
it
over
vintage
rodenbach
im
glad
i
tried
it
for
sure
but
i
doubt
id
place
it
on
the
top
250
imo
o
this
was
very
tasty
the
cherry
flavor
was
unmistakeable
without
being
at
all
artificial
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
plenty
big
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
big
cherry
presence
good
levels
of
sourness
as
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
am
enjoying
this
very
much
as
i
type
and
wish
i
could
get
more
of
it
m
medium
body
exceptionally
dry
light
carbonation
oud
tart
really
does
all
it
says
in
its
name
yet
its
acidic
cherry
flavor
dwarfs
its
more
succulent
fruit
tones
its
lacking
savory
presence
allows
the
sourness
to
act
much
more
like
a
young
green
and
imature
lambic
more
so
than
a
mature
flanders
red
ale
one
of
the
most
sour
yet
complex
beers
ive
ever
tasted
the
flavors
work
well
here
and
the
cherries
add
a
nice
level
of
complexity
that
makes
this
brew
one
to
seek
out
the
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
very
little
carbonated
bite
this
does
give
one
the
feeling
it
needs
to
be
sipped
and
not
drunk
done
quickly
appearance
is
a
deep
red
with
nice
clarity
and
not
much
head
nose
is
entirely
different
than
regular
oude
tart
tons
of
cherry
skin
dark
fruit
lactobacillus
and
a
bit
of
oak
the
flavor
is
very
sour
with
tons
of
tart
cherry
oak
berry
skin
and
tannins
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
different
beast
than
the
base
beer
overall
no
one
else
in
my
group
liked
this
except
me
its
too
damn
sour
but
its
good
loved
this
beer
tried
it
next
to
sour
in
the
rye
with
kumquats
two
very
different
styles
of
sours
some
of
the
group
liked
the
sour
in
the
rye
better
and
some
agreed
with
me
and
thought
this
was
a
better
beer
you
pull
some
of
the
cherry
and
the
wood
from
the
barrel
and
the
nose
is
very
nice
it
just
seems
to
be
a
well
balanced
sour
and
i
would
like
to
see
what
happens
to
this
beer
with
a
little
age
overall
wow
amazing
and
i
cant
recommend
it
any
more
get
it
asap
oude
tart
is
one
of
the
few
bruery
beers
i
like
but
somehow
this
version
didnt
really
do
anything
for
me
dark
ruddy
brown
pour
with
a
thin
wispy
head
minimal
retention
and
lacing
was
not
surprising
fairly
tart
aroma
as
would
be
expected
some
earthy
funk
notes
of
phenolic
cherry
more
of
this
in
the
taste
tart
somewhat
acetic
earthy
funky
oaky
overripe
cherry
pulp
leather
cherry
cough
syrup
with
a
slightly
tealike
herbal
quality
coming
through
medium
body
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
with
a
sour
prickle
to
it
seemed
kind
of
like
an
if
it
aint
broke
dont
fix
it
scenario
to
me
where
they
took
an
already
decent
base
beer
and
went
just
a
little
too
far
still
good
but
i
prefer
the
original
as
nice
as
the
nose
is
the
palate
really
shines
plenty
sour
with
a
blend
of
moderate
red
wine
vinegar
and
plenty
of
sour
cherries
bursting
fresh
and
unabashedly
flavorful
leathery
tannic
and
with
a
touch
of
tobacco
the
contrast
here
is
really
nice
tannic
red
wine
especially
on
the
midpalate
is
present
sour
on
the
finish
with
a
fleshy
fruity
juicy
sour
cherry
flavor
dominating
theres
also
a
touch
of
meat
a
flavor
ive
found
in
more
than
one
oud
bruin
im
not
making
this
up
i
swear
medium
light
in
body
moderately
carbonated
this
beer
feels
good
on
the
palate
both
the
base
beer
and
the
fruited
version
are
intense
but
this
particular
batch
manages
to
channel
the
intensity
in
ways
that
make
this
really
work
recommended
very
similar
to
what
i
remember
of
the
original
oude
tart
with
the
tasteful
addition
of
tart
cherries
beautifully
done
overall
this
brew
is
outstanding
nice
notes
of
vinegar
and
sour
cherry
notes
mixed
in
with
woody
funk
notes
and
a
nice
mediumloght
body
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
with
a
modest
to
lighter
level
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
a
nice
upgrade
from
the
base
brew
the
cherry
inclusion
is
very
enjoyable
but
it
is
quite
sharp
though
and
that
hinders
the
overall
drinkability
a
little
for
me
o
oude
tart
with
a
nice
oakycherry
finish
nice
o
i
think
this
lived
up
to
my
expectations
it
has
the
stock
bruery
wild
ale
flavors
and
comes
together
as
oude
tart
with
a
darker
color
the
cherry
flavors
are
not
overly
strong
but
doesnt
add
a
ton
of
complexity
to
the
beer
it
seems
like
oude
tart
with
a
twist
which
is
a
good
beer
to
begin
with
but
not
too
much
of
a
differentiator
really
overall
oude
tart
with
or
without
added
cherries
is
one
of
my
favorite
sours
from
any
brewery
outstanding
beer
not
sure
why
its
listed
as
american
wild
if
its
a
flanders
red
with
cherries
added
m
medium
bodied
carbonation
ok
p
s
this
review
typed
by
my
intoxicated
wife
thanks
the
feel
is
obvious
very
acidic
but
has
a
nice
body
and
flavor
profile
as
it
rolls
over
the
plate
and
leaves
quite
a
mark
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
very
good
brew
super
tasty
o
the
thoughtful
addition
of
cherries
to
oude
tart
an
already
sour
base
beer
brings
a
harmonious
congregation
of
assertive
flavors
to
the
table
oak
cherry
skin
tobacco
and
leather
just
to
name
a
few
its
tearjerking
sourness
will
more
than
satisfy
the
cravings
of
any
sour
power
lover
making
it
one
hell
of
a
beer
overall
good
but
i
dont
think
its
worlds
above
the
original
which
was
awesome
to
begin
with
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
good
cherry
notes
it
added
nicely
to
this
beer
very
enjoyable
darker
than
regular
oude
tart
nice
slight
head
of
carbonation
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
the
cherries
give
it
a
more
fruit
forward
taste
and
more
clean
tartness
i
love
the
regular
version
but
this
is
definitely
a
notch
above
great
beer
to
drink
at
cellar
temp

warmer

is
extremely

i
could
drink
this
for
days

end
overall
excellent
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
great
beer
pretty
on
par
with
the
regular
oude
tart
just
more
focused
around
cherries
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
at
ebf
the
flavor
wasnt
quite
as
complex
are
integrated
as
the
nose
and
it
was
a
tad
bit
more
acidforward
without
as
much
of
the
underlying
cherry
oak
and
fruit
flavors
still
quite
good
the
feel
integrated
the
two
acid
components
quite
well
and
mixed
things
up
really
well
with
the
cherries
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
was
thrilled
to
see
on
the
menu
bottle
this
now
minimal

obviously
rasberries
it
even
smells
tart
taste
follows
super
sweet
and
tart
in
fact
it
is
reminiscent
of
the
candy
sweet
tarts
feel
is
light
with
great
carbonation
good
drinkability
due
to
its
refreshing
nature
abv
is
completely
hidden
by
the
mouth
puckering
sourness
of
the
beer
i
like
it
wish
it
was
available
in
bottles
carbonation
is
thankfully
there
to
help
lighten
up
the
medium
bodied
beer
soft
and
delicate
bubbles
preventing
an
overly
syrupy
mouthfeel
tart
but
not
alcoholic
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
for
how
sour
it
is
on
the
tongue
but
it
makes
me
both
thirsty
for
more
and
hungry
for
some
food
d
i
am
glad
i
got
a
sample
of
this
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
cherries
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
i
hope
they
end
up
bottling
it
at
some
point
i
would
love
to
have
a
few
will
definitely
be
looking
for
this
one
again
and
again
at
bruery
events
overall
i
cant
say
this
is
better
than
oude
tart
but
i
cant
say
its
worse
they
both
have
their
own
qualities
that
i
like
in
them

nice

cherry
aroma
in

along
with
slight

light
mouthfeel
well
balanced
comes
to
mind
as
i
drink
this
it
really
isnt
overly
sweet
or
sour
but
somewhere
in
the
middle
with
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
being
counteracted
by
the
tartness
and
vice
versa
ends
with
a
lingering
tartness
very
drinkable

imperial
pint
at

society
party
poured
a
murky
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
and
cherries
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
citrus
and
very
slight
cherries
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medhigh
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
quite
excellent
the
cherries
were
definitely
a
nice
touch
as
when
compared
to
the
regular
version
of
oude
tart
if
you
like
sours
you
will
definitely
enjoy
this
one
with
its
well
balanced
flavors
and
good
aroma
to
bring
you
back
for
more
a
definite
must
try
drink
superb
beer
in
my
opinion
i
really
enjoyed
it
along
with
choc
rain
and
57
wild
for
the
day
tastes
like
sour
cherries
unsurprisingly
cherries
are
dominant
but
theres
an
acetic
and
vinous
undercurrent
thats
quite
nice
very
enjoyable
and
balanced
albeit
somewhat
onedimensional
theres
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
this
is
largely
sour
large
quantities
could
get
stomachchurning
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
a
few
small
pours
this
is
the
best
wild
ale
ive
ever
had
from
the
bruery
they
really
nailed
it
poured
a
dark
murky
brown
with
reddish
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
huge
on
the
cherries
along
with
mild
vinegar
acidic
character
oakiness
and
faint
citrus
notes
the
taste
was
also
slammed
by
the
cherries
with
vinegar
oaky
tart
and
acidic
accents
but
did
have
a
touch
of
citrus
that
added
a
little
dimension
nice
cherry
bomb
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
fruity
slight
acidic
but
oaky
sticky
tart
finish
it
drank
real
good
and
was
glad
that
this
was
left
over
to
try
after
the
reseve
society
party
nice
beer
all
around
i
honestly
hope
they
can
find
it
in
them
to
bottle
this
tasty
goodness
with
cherries
or
without
that
is
the
question
better
yet
drink
both
versions
and
you
wont
have
that
problem
d
cherries
are
just
a
great
complement
to
the
already
phenomenal
oude
tart
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
very
good
and
though
i
cant
say
its
an
improvement
upon
the
original
which
was
already
a
great
beer
its
certainly
very
nice
in
its
own
way
really
a
superlative
beer
d
probably
the
best
beer
of
the
eventafternoon
the
addition
of
cherries
seemed
like
a
natural
addition
to
this
beer
and
they
certainly
were
on
tap
at
the
bruery
mercypoured
into
a
taster
after
i
pleaded
with
the
bartender
to
give
me
a
pass
on
the
bring
a
toy
rule
they
were
using
to
restrict
access
to
a
few
choice
beers
didnt
hurt
that
i
bought
a
couple
of

dry

finish
one
of
the
better
bruery
beers
ive
experienced
terrific
sour
and
well
deserving
of
its
phenomenal
ratings
one
of
my
favorite
bruery
beers
ever
balanced
and
nuanced
with
big
fresh
raspberry
notes
and
a
full
dry
wit
as
its
base
wheat
character
is
present
but
restrained
yeasty
esters
are
on
the
mild
side
but
thats
pleasant
for
a
beer
this
big
and
fruity
just
a
joy
to
drink
and
one
that
id
be
happy
to
see
them
enter
into
regular
rotation
and
come
up
with
a
name
for
for
the
most
part
i
havent
been
impressed
with
bruerys
sours
this
one
is
different
though
mellow
yet
complex
with
great
feel
im
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
sample
this
one
overall
really
good
stuff
the
fruit
addition
and
barrel
aging
each
add
noticeable
flavor
and
complexity
to
an
already
solid
base
beer
worth
seeking
out
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
this
is
a
solid
enough
effort
it
is
not
overly
tart
and
the
raspberry
notes
help
to
balance
out
the
sour
base
i
actually
started
enjoying
this
not
as
it
warmed
a
bit
got
juicier
and
fruitier
throughout

overall
just
a
really
welldone
beer
its
not
as
fullon
sour
as
many
of
bruerys
best
offerings
but
i
think
thats
to
its
benefit
the
sourness
is
just
one
component
of
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
depth
and
interest
to
offer
i
love
how
the
use
of
fruit
and
lacto
take
the
subtle
bit
of
tartness
that
you
often
find
in
classic
witbiers
and
turn
it
slightly
on
its
head
amping
up
the
sourness
but
not
at
the
expense
of
the
overall
beer
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
bottles
of
this
o
very
good
went
back
for
more
o
good
sour
that
is
well
balanced
with
light
tartness
and
some
good
fruit
presence
from
the
raspberries
o
the
bruerys
bottleworks
xii
has
a
lot
going
on
layers
of
complexity
continue
to
unveil
in
this
big
beer
from
its
impressive
imperial
witbier
base
through
the
deep
finish
fruit
thrown
in
the
mix
while
oak
aging
in
red
wine
barrels
makes
for
a
unique
sour
that
crosses
all
sorts
of
boundaries
for
a
delicious
beer
worthy
of
aging
m
medium
bodied
or
so
definitely
on
the
heavier
end
of
the
spectrum
for
what
it
is
pretty
serious
carbonation
that
works
fantastically
for
this
one
nice
cloudy
orange
beer
smells
like
brett
right
off
the
bat
it
looks
like
orange
juice
was
poured
in
taste
is
very
refreshing
this
is
a
wild
beer
it
could
be
a
berliner
a
witbier
a
sour
ale
it
can
be
whatever
it
wants
to
be
body
is
a
bit

o
a
very
tasty
beer
theres
a
wine
characteristic
andor
richness
that
would
limit
how
much
or
how
often
i
have
this
but
it
was
well
worth
a
try
oda
cool
beer
with
a
cool
description
of
how
it
was
brewed
refreshing
to
drink
for
sure
there
was
plenty
going
on
in
this
brew
taste
is
moderately
sour
puckering
and
finishes
very
dry
some
light
fuzzy
raspberry
skins
lend
a
fruity
bitterness
almost
maybe
from
the
tannin
in
the
seeds
or
skins
very
quenching
and
pretty
drinkable
though
fairly
acidic
a
good
one
to
share
overall
very
good
beer
that
flirts
with
being
great
i
dont
think
it
quite
reaches
that
status
but
im
sure
most
would
disagree
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
would
not
balk
at
the
price
its
worth
it
overall
very
impressed
with
this
beer
hits
my
personal
taste
on
just
about
everything
nice
mild
amount
of
sour
with
a
little
funk
and
really
nice
fruited
flavors
berries
and
brett
go
really
well
together
in
my
opinion
hazy
golden
colour
one
finger
of
white
head
some
lace
as
well
smell
is
funky
raspberry
and
oak
brett
lemony
and
fruity
some
spice
with
tart
with
a
lingering

acidity
as
well
taste
is
of
tart
raspberry
oak
sour
lemon
and
mild
citrus
fruit
barnyardy
brett
funky
all
the
way
through
drying
finish
with
lingering
fruit
and
oak
spritzy
high
carbonation
dry
medium
body
exceptional
stuff
drinks
like
its
5
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
this
may
be
a
controversial
statement
but
this
is
perhaps
the
greatest
beer
the
bruery
has
ever
made
and
ever
will
make
at
least
for
now
why
the
alcohol
is
just
high
enough
and
it
displays
only
the
best
aspects
this
brewery
is
known
for
excellent
oak
blending
sour
fruit
infused
notes
sweet
yet
not
overthetop
maltiness
and
the
always
caramel
forward
thick
forward
mouth
feel
their
beers
are
known
for
tasting
like
this
a
whole
full
year
after
being
bottled
why
its
the
stuff
of
wizards
i
want
a
whole
case
of
this
mind
blowing
life
changing
stuff
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
as
soon
as
you
can
just
wow
pour
is
light
golden
amber
mostly
transparent
with
a
fairly
tight
white
head
no
red
in
the
appearance
but
there
is
plenty
of
raspberry
in
the
nose
its
fleshy
but
not
super
bright
there
is
a
hint
of
barrel
and
a
touch
of
leathery
bret
taste
is
little
brighter
raspberry
with
a
fair
bit
of
lacto
finish
is
highly
carbonated
and
muddles
the
flavor
in
back
a
little
with
a
touch
of
sulfer
soft
creamy
body
and
actually
pretty
dry
t
a
big
load
of
lemon
and
intensely
tart
raspberry
upfront
with
a
great
lactic
sourness
the
wit
base
comes
through
nicely
here
with
a
touch
of
coriander
and
some
wheat
finishes
tart
and
clean
with
some
ripe
raspberry
and
a
touch
of
wine
barrel
o
this
was
pretty
good
but
it
really
didnt
live
up
to
my
fairly
high
expectations
perhaps
some
time
in
the
cellar
will
allow
more
characteristics
of
a
sour
beer
come
through
i
expect
some
of
the
berries
to
drop
out
but
frankly
they
werent
predominant
fairly
fresh
so
i
dont
expect
the
beers
flavor
to
suffer
particularly
excellent
so
much
going
on
but
somehow
simple
and
addictively
drinkable
impressive
coup
overall
i
think
this
is
on
par
with
other
bruery
sours
and
quite
a
nice
addition
to
their
lineup
which
is
quite
impressive
to
say
the
least
o
the
smell
was
the
only
letdown
about
this
beer
otherwise
its
kind
of
a
big
deal
pours
a
cloudy
light
blonde
very
inviting
nose
with
some
hints
of
berries
and
lemon
absolutely
delicious
maybe
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
the
bruery
certainly
the
best
sour
ive
had
from
them
the
witbier
base
is
completely
on
point
with
berry
flavor
that
isnt
cloying
and
lemony
tartness
that
is
refreshing
taste
has
some
seedy
berry
flavors
with
some
leathery
brett
and
fruity
tartness
but
its
not
really
all
that
sour
the
funk
leans
more
feet
than
earth
mouthfeel
is
good
the
tiny
carbonation
and
moderate
sweetness
give
it
a
full
and
creamy
feel
raspberries
are
nice
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
pretty
meh
a
fantastic
beer
and
surprisingly
has
hints
of
fou
foune
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
to
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
it
smells
awesome
and
taste
is
well
just
decent
for
what
it
is
it
is
quite
enjoyable
but
i
was
hoping
for
less
witbiersulfurminerals
and
more
tart
fruit
beer
pours
dense
hazy
orange
uneven
frothy
head
dissipates
quickly
to
rest
in
a
swirl
on
the
surface
aroma
is
apricot
citrus
raspberry
vanilla
cream
lactic
tart
funkiness
oak
fruity
red
wine
notes
earthy
barnyard
taste
is
lactic
tart
malt
notes
witbier
origins
evident
mild
acidity
and
citrus
soft
raspberry
notes
coming
through
the
middle
grapes
and
vinous
character
to
finish
medium
body
mellow
sourness
and
acidity
lends
a
lot
of
drinkability
well
balanced
amazing
beer
pours
a
muddy
copper
with
a
think
head
probably
the
weakest
point
of
this
beer
just
uninteresting
to
look
at
smell
is
raspberry
pineapple
lemon
and
wheat
one
of
my
favorite
smelling
beers
ever
taste
is
a
lot
of
lemon
tartness
mild
honey
sweetness
and
wheat
lots
of
bread
very
crisp
carbonation
and
light
body
like
a
dry
lemon
raspberry
soda
terrific
onot
as
sour
as
i
was
hoping
but
the
balance
was
amazing
the
abv
at
8
is
just
right
to
make
this
a
very
drinkable
satisfying
beer
i
can
drink
this
with
no
problem
a
fantastic
sour
beer
to
me
the
bruerys
best
given
that
it
can
age
up
to
2
years
i
am
getting
me
some
more
of
this
for
the
cellar
m
medium
bodied
wow
this
beer
is
goldenrod
colored
little
head
on
the
pour
and
only
a
few
spots
of
lace
around
the
aroma
brings
to
me
sweet
accents
of
lemon
and
a
kiss
of
raspberry
the
flavor
straightforward
yet
relaxed
easy
to
translate
and
very
tasty
it
tastes
almost
like
a
raspberry
lemonade
theres
a
small
dose
of
funk
and
vague
spice
but
even
without
those
lesser
notes
the
base
flavor
would
rock
anyway
the
carbonation
level
is
light
perhaps
from
aging
though
its
mouthfeel
is
still
at
an
acceptable
level
better
late
than
never
and
im
glad
i
got
to
taste
this
creation
overall
a
great
imperial
sour
wit
i
have
yet
to
have
a
sour
from
the
bruery
that
i
didnt
enjoy
and
i
think
this
is
in
the
top
3
i
could
easily
drink
a
bottle
or
2
of
this
d
overall
this
is
an
intense
beer
lot
of
sourness
packed
into
it
however
there
are
enough
other
things
going
on
to
not
only
cut
into
the
sourness
but
add
very
nice
layers
of
complexity
very
much
recommended
for
those
who
like
red
wine
barrel
aged
beers
and
especially
framboises
o
i
like
but
dont
love
this
beer
its
definitely
a
porchsipper
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
its
just
not
sour
enough
for
my
palate
it
tends
to
be
more
on
the
funkycomplex
side
than
the
sour
side
unfortunately
i
find
theres
almost
too
much
complexity
going
on
flavors
become
muddled
and
the
sum
of
the
parts
doesnt
transcend
each
individual
component
a
good
beer
it
just
doesnt
have
the
sourness
and
straightforward
flavor
profile
i
was
expecting
o
i
had
very
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
it
definitely
delivered
its
not
as
acidic
as
some
of
the
other
bruery
beers
delicious
o
very
good
raspberry
summer
refresher
great
fresh
raspberry
character
in
aroma
and
flavor
crisp
and
refreshing
tartness
and
tingly
carbonation
base
beer
is
pretty
basic
with
the
fruit
and
wine
barrel
yielding
most
of
the
character
alcohol
presence
isnt
noticeable
even
at
8
mild
funkiness
very
nice
beer
expected
a
ruby
colored
beer
with
an
overwhelming
abundance
of
raspberry
instead
i
got
a
nicer
balance
tart
a
little
bit
of
funk
well
balanced
and
garden
fresh
raspberry
addition
and
subtle
wine
barrel
influence
what
i
got
was
better
than
i
expected
and
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
ahead
of
time
yet
another
very
unique
beer
from
the
bruery
here
they
took
an
imperial
witbier
dosed
it
with
their
berliner
weisse
culture
and
threw
it
in
red
wine
barrels
with
fresh
raspberries
incredibly
they
managed
to
keep
in
balance
the
tart
berliner
weisse
cultures
and
naturally
tart
raspberries
with
the
normally
very
delicate
belgian
witbier
style
although
its
not
my
favorite
sour
from
the
bruery
this
is
a
very
high
quality
beer
and
definitely
worth
tracking
down
overall
meh
not
nearly
as
great
as
i
was
expecting
raspberry
is
more
of
the
tannic
seedstem
and
very
little
fruit
funk
is
muted
too
much
wit
beer
comes
out
too
strong
the
wine
barrel
is
pretty
nice
but
might
be
whats
muting
the
other
great
flavors
overall
a
good
sour
i
will
add
upon
letting
it
warm
a
bit
above
the
recommended
serving
temp
the
taste
profile
came
across
more
balanced
and
vibrant
o
overall
i
was
surprisingly
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
cant
believe
how
mediocre
this
is
veryi
unfortunate
unique
and
solid
sour
one
of
the
best
the
bruery
beers
out
there
the
bruery
is
getting
damn
good
at
sours
o
this
was
a
good
sour
for
the
bruery
i
have
heard
that
this
is
the
one
for
sours
with
the
bruery
it
was
good
not
great
when
cs
is
in
my
backyard
i
am
critical
on
sours
o
had
it
before
at
the
anniversary
parties
and
thought
it
was
better
dont
know
if
that
is
because
i
knew
it
was
vintage
or
this
will
actually
age
well
hoping
for
the
later
o
im
glad
i
maxed
out
my
allocations
it
is
definitely
an
excellent
sour
hopefully
it
will
become
more
tart
with
some
more
time

thanks
man
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
some
floaties
present
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
way
of
head
the
nose
starts
with
some
citric
funk
followed
by
lemon
and
wheat
the
raspberries
work
their
way
through
with
tart
notes
and
a
bit
of
oak
comes
through
at
the
end
the
taste
matches
the
nose
with
a
light
refreshing
wheaty
tart
palate
reminds
me
of
a
beefed
up
berliner
i
wouldnt
call
this
beer
overwhelmingly
sour
but
it
does
have
a
nice
dash
of
tartness
notes
of
lemon
and
raspberry
again
followed
by
some
hints
of
wheat
at
the
back
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
overall
the
8
is
non
existent
which
works
well
for
this
brew
a
nice
unique
brew
and
worth
a
try
this
is
the
best
beer
that
the
bruery
brews
imho
an
amazing
beer
thats
aging
gracefully
o
highly
drinkable
and
very
good
complexity
the
oak
treatment
is
really
nice
but
im
not
entirely
sure
i
can
detect
the
red
wines
influence

o
a
fantastic
awa
glad
it
was
still
on
tap
when
i
got
over
to
bw
overall
a
surprising
tasty
unique
beer
glad
i
had
another
chance
to
try
this
one
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
o
it
is
really
nice
how
clean
this
is
despite
its
level
of
acidity
and
showing
of
oak
it
has
its
almost
weird
based
on
its
color
yet
is
has
so
many
notes
of
the
red
wine
and
raspberry
very
nicely
done
verdict
a
wonderful
wild
ale
all
of
the
base
elements
are
so
nicely
captured
and
the
harmony
between
them
is
superb
the
flavors
are
complex
balanced
and
executed
to
perfection
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
loves
a
good
sour
beer
pours
a
pale
yellowish
orange
its
quite
cloudy
white
head
of
fine
foam
fairly
small
in
size
little
lacing
dissipates
after
a
minute
aroma
has
some
really
nice
raspberry
flavor
combined
with
oak
and
vinous
flavors
jammy
berry
tart
and
flavorful
moderate
funk
nice
stuff
taste
has
a
good
deal
of
oaky
bitterness
moderate
sourness
mild
raspberry
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
some
vanilla
light
feel
very
mild
pucker
nice
sour
this
was
one
of
my
highlights
from
the
barrel
night
this
is
an
exceptional
wild
ale
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
on
the
one
year
anniversary
of
my
accidentsurgery
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
funk
wheat
fruit
subtle
sour
and
raspberry
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
fruit
tart
sour
and
raspberry
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
one
had
quite
a
bit
of
really
nice
things
going
on
in
it
the
aroma
was
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
flavor
however
the
flavor
was
quite
a
bit
more
pleasant
everything
going
on
in
the
flavor
here
was
really
nice
and
when
there
was
one
note
another
followed
close
behind
that
worked
in
unison
to
help
you
get
through
the
sourtart
mashing
on
your
palate
this
was
a
really
well
put
together
brew
that
im
really
quite
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
i
need
more
of
this
stuff
right
away
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
dots
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
also
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spice
wood
and
some
wine
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
but
is
pretty
sour
and
funky
as
well
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
solid
aroma
and
really
nice
set
of
flavors
that
make
it
easy
to
drink
overall
light
in
body
and
to
be
honest
flavor
not
overly
sour
not
overly
raspberryish
the
malts
come
through
as
much
as
the
sour
components
and
the
fruit
its
still
a
good
beer
but
not
one
that
lives
up
to
its
rating
this
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
i
was
hoping
for
pours
a
very
cloudymurky
yellowish
orange
straw
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
quite
funky
more
so
than
i
was
expecting
some
pleasant
peaches
with
strawberries
and
raspberries
along
with
wheat
scents
some
brett
with
lemon
zesty
aromas
definitely
has
berlinerlike
aromas
taste
is
just
as
it
smells
but
with
more
strawberry
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
a
lot
of
hay
though
with
a
ton
of
lemon
and
some
very
tart
flavor
not
overly
sour
but
borderline
the
lemon
really
comes
through
nicely
in
this
beer
nice
acidic
finish
with
more
wheat
mouthfeel
is
very
good
for
this
style
drinkability
is
high
overall
they
call
this
an
imperial
sour
wit
the
only
other
imperial
berliner
i
had
was
from
lips
of
faith
and
this
one
blows
that
outta
the
water
would
like
to
have
picked
up
more
from
the
red
wine
barrels
but
it
was
a
great
beer
regardless
so
glad
i
finally
got
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
o
very
good
enjoyable
and
worth
the
hype
overall
worth
a
go
but
hard
to
call
this
a
wild
ale
more
imperial
witbier
or
derivative
imperial
berliner
o
fizzy
nice
sour
and
tartness
i
am
so
glad
to
finally
get
to
try
this
one
delicious
pretty
good
sour
this
definitely
is
very
loyal
to
the
berliner
style
base
but
with
the
added
delicious
fruit
notes
of
the
raspberry
tasty
beer
heavily
tart
without
being
sour
plenty
of
haylike
brett
and
tannic
fruit
a
bit
on
the
tame
side
for
my
tastes
more
funk
please
o
great
flavor
in
this
one
i
thought
the
raspberries
were
noticeable
but
they
could
have
been
more
prominent
thanks

update
popped
a
bottle
of
the
61013
vintage
and
drank
it
in
feb
2015
not
a
huge
difference
from
the
fresh
version
though
there
does
seem
to
be
more
pineapple
and
barnyardy
funkiness
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
too
is
funkier
and
seems
to
have
a
little
less
raspberry
not
better
overall
but
not
worse
either
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
wanted
a
little
bit
more
out
of
this
beer
not
sure
where
the
raspberries
were
but
i
dont
think
they
were
in
our
bottle
the
tasted
had
more
tart
character
alongside
wine
oak
berries
and
really
funky
bretty
flavor
but
with
a
touch
of
citrus
very
intresting
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
oaky
fruity
tannic
bretty
funky
dry
and
tart
finish
it
was
drinking
quite
weel
and
was
glad
to
have
tried
it
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
overall
very
tasty
refreshing
tart
pretty
complex
flavorsaromas
a
great
sour
this
pours
a
strawyellow
without
a
hint
of
raspberry
and
a
whitish
head
the
nose
is
raspberry
and
musty
horse
blanket
funk
smells
really
interesting
and
good
there
is
a
strong
presence
of
wheatfunk
and
sour
in
this
beer
with
the
sourness
being
sharp
like
unflavored
sour
candy
that
is
reminiscent
of
beatification
raspberry
lemon
and
oak
round
it
all
out
this
really
comes
together
very
well
soured
imperial
wit
beer
didnt
sound
good
to
me
but
it
really
worked
well
good
carbonation
with
a
decent
body
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
fantastic
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
lots
of
nice
white
head
looks
pretty
solid
smells
funky
as
shit
horse

wow
crazy
smells
very
odd
tastes
sweet
wheaty
very
funky
tart
veery
interesting
i
really
enjoy
the
beer
not
too
sour
nce
well
carbonated
overall
top
notch
overall
maybe
this
was
a
victim
of
following
an
incredible
beer
but
i
was
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
thanks
to
dr
j
for
sharing
this
treat
with
me
750ml

with

i
commented
that
it
smells
like
something
my
daughter
would
like
aroma
was
like
a
mixture
between
tang
and
squirt
so
i
am
expecting
a
sour
influenced
witbeer
okay
thats
new
starts
off
with
doughy
grapefruit
and
apple
skins
you
can
get
the
influence
of
the
wine
barrels
and
raspberries
right
up
front
lighter
notes
of
the
brett
throughout
well
carbed
somewhat
lactic
with
orange
rinds
and
kumquats
on
the
finish
this
is
different
but
a
pretty
nice
brew
thanks
jason
a
surprisingly
excellent
beer
i
expected
this
to
be
good
but
didnt
expect
to
come
away
thinking
it
was
so
exceptional
nice
balance
between
acidity
and
tartness
brightly
fruit
and
refreshing
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
fruited
imperial
berliner
weisse
from
the
bruery
o
handsdown
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
ever
had
if
the
smell
was
a
little
better
this
beer
would
be
an
alltime
great
if
you
ask
me
take
this
with
a
grain
of
salt
though
this
is
coming
from
someone
who
loves
berliner
weisses
so
its
right
up
my
alley
o
a
good
beer
but
really
not
worth
the
crazy
hype
its
certainly
a
tasty
creation
o
a
great
beer
worth
sharing
with
friends
overall
i
think
for
the
style
it
is
pretty
on
par
just
not
my
favorite
one
to
drink
i
didnt
think
it
was
as
good
as
the
hype
but
maybe
if
i
really
enjoyed
this
style
i
would
think
it
is
amazing
it
was
really
really
really
good
the
tartness
of
the
raspberries
was
the
overwhelming
note
but
theres
plenty
of
belgian
yeast
and
sour
goodness
that
shine
through
as
well
this
was
acquired
due
to
a
friends
overwhelming
kindness
to
share
it
with
the
gf
and
i
as
its
a
limited
release
decently
beyond
its
time
and
id
have
nearzero
hope
of
getting
it
without
similarly
hyped
beers
in
trade
a
high
point
of
my
trip
to
seattle
for
sure
drink
it
was
lacking
the
wowit
factor
for
me
it
was
a
nice
beer
but
a
touch
small
for
the
hype
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
have
my
fair
share
was
just
hoping
for
more
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
hazed
yellow
straw
color
with
a
nice
little
white
head
good
carbonation
the
wheat
and
straw
type
notes
are
eveident
right
off
the
bat
in
the
nose
but
you
also
get
some
barnyard
funk
raspberry
and
lemongrass
i
am
really
hoping
the
taste
is
like
the
nose
the
flavors
in
the
taste
are
nice
with
notes
of
lemon
wheat
and
raspberry
as
it
warms
a
bit
the
barnyard
funk
flavor
moves
in
and
becomes
more
apparent
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
there
is
little
to
no
real
alcohol
flavors
here
overall
an
awesome
beer
wish
i
had
gotten
more
of
it
too
many
beers
to
try
and
not
enough
time
plus
i
was
pretty
toasty
by
the
end
of
the
party
a
pity
it
wont
cross
my
path
again
very
well
carbonated
with
a
frothy
white
head
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
complex
refreshing
and
damn
drinkable
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
probably
had
24
ounces
of
this
before
the
end
of
the
day
o
this
is
certainly
an
unusual
brew
i
am
not
terribly
fond
of
the
nose
but
found
the
taste
much
more
palatable
i
enjoy
most
of
the
aspects
at
least
moderately
the
major
gripe
i
have
is
the
taste
reminds
me
of
the
nose
and
associated
unpleasantries
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
also
a
bit
slick
and
goes
down
rather
smooth
moderately
carbonated
its
a
mild
sour
with
a
bit
of
tartness
that
pokes
at
the
cheek
from
the
sides
of
the
tongue
finish
is
a
bit
dry
but
the
raspberries
continue
on
the
palate
overrall
it
was
incredibly
drinkable
and
pretty
refreshing
shouldnt
be
a
surprise
for
a
witbier
wish
i
could
have
picked
out
more
of
the
spices
but
they
seemed
to
be
very
much
in
the
background
id
love
to
try
this
again
in
a
few
years
and
see
how
acidic
the
raspberries
make
it
light
on
the
palate
and
the
sweet
fresh
raspberries
work
very
nicely
with
the
yeasty
notes
to
create
a
great
beer
very
solid
stuff
this
is
the
body
is
great
its
a
bit
denser
than
expected
from
a
witbier
lots
of
sour
lemon
lactic
acid
some
raspberry
try
this
one
out
if
you
get
a
chance

overall
pretty
enjoyable
but
found
the
beer
favorable
nonetheless
plenty
of
tartness
to
be
found
here
bright
and
fragrant
with
a
wonderful
carbonic
and
spicy
with
a
touch

a

is

too
really

impressive
so
damn
good
and
surpassed
the
expectations
i
had
for
this
one
want
more
sour
tarts
overall
as
a
general
thing
i
simply
do
not
understand
this
style
if
this
is
your
type
of
thing
then
i
would
suggest
getting
a
bottle
because
for
what
it
is
it
does
a
very
good
job
if
you
dont
care
for
this
style
dont
expect
this
beer
to
change
your
mind
overall
pretty
good
great
even
just
not
for
me
also
hab11
just
reminded
me
thus
was
aged
in
oak
barrels
i
got
no
barrel
presence
whatsoever
no
oak
tannins
from
which
this
beer
could
have
greatly
benefitted
not
for
me
but
maybe
for
you

most
stouts
simplicity
subtlety
and
elegance
are
characteristics
this
beer
brings
to
the
table
better
than
any
stout
and
almost
any
sour
ale
ive
ever
tasted
truly
a
boundary
breaker
and
a
testament
to
demonstrate
where
craft
beer
can
go

i
guess
some
people
are
really
into
this
whole
sour
beer
craze
and
i
can
imagine
theres
probably
a
huge
following
for
this
type
of
beer
but
for
me
id
rather
spend
a
fraction
of
the
cost
and
get
myself
a
bottle
of
vinegar
and
a
bottle
of
soy
sauce
has
definitely
opened
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
i
am
indeed
not
a
sour
drinker

this
one
was
very
sour
and
tasty
my
enough
stout
in
my
opinion
could
taste
the
oak
pretty
nicely
in
the
finish
but
didnt
give
me
that
milky
depth
that
a

have

i
would
have
returned
to

not
what
i
expected
definitely
more
of
a
sour
than
stout
but
it
was
enjoyable
i
expected
to
pick
up
some
typical
roasted
character
of
a
stout
but
that
didnt
seem
to
be
present
this
beer
was
pretty
good
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
exceptional
at
20bottle
i
am
not
likely
to
try
this
again
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
stoutsour
hybrid
but
i
only
picked
up
hints
of
the
stout
flavors
blind
taste
test
i
would
have
identified
it
as
a
straight

ale
pours
very
dark
almost
black
much
more
tart
than
i
expected
given
the
barrel
aging
a
very
good
sour
ale
with
a
nose
and
taste
of
sour
cherries
with
some
maltiness
a
good
beer
but
dominated
by
the
tartness
overall4

i
am
pretty
new
to
sour
beers
this
only
being
about
my
4th
and
so
far
this
is
my
second
favorite
this
beer
drinks
like
a
lighter
beer
as
im
sure
most
sours
do
id
have
some
trouble
calling
this
a
stout
but
it
is
damn
good
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
if
i
ever
come
across
it
i
cant
profess
to
be
an
expert
on
sours
whether
american
or
otherwise
but
this
is
the
type
i
like
more
fruity
than
something
like
a
supplication
this
stuff
was
very
tasty
deliciously
sour
looking
forward
to
my
next
bottle
i
made
a
sour
of
my
own
a
few
years
ago
and
it
was
very
similar
in
taste
to
this
beer
except
that
it
didnt
cost
me
20
a
bottle
ultimately
my
disappointment
is
due
to
the
high
price
of
the
beer
and
thus
high
expectations
and
the
optimistic
labeling
that
implies
more
stout
flavor
than
i
was
able
to
get
out
of
it
april
2014
bottle
a
black
with
a
hint
of
brown
almost
no
head
reminds
me
of
cocacola
actually
n
sour
cherries
apples
plums
maybe
some
muted
vanilla
some
roasted

plenty
of
oak
barrel
t
sour
cherries
plums
apples
roasted

a
truckload
of
sourness
and
lots
of
oak
barrel
m
a
bit
creamy
low
carbonation
a
sticky
sweet
sourness
that
coats
the
mouth
and
lingers
o
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
beer
if
i
have
any
complaints
it
is
the
sticky
mouthfeel
that
lingers
otherwise
it
is
my
go
to
sour
fantastic
dark
sour
imperial
stout
out
standing
going
to
try
cellaring
a
bottle
sorry
if
my
score
seems
too
harsh
this
beer
is
not
badly
executed
for
what
it
is
but
it
is
just
not
for
me
it
would
like
to
have
seen
the
sourness
glanced
with
some
stout
characteristics
im
left
a
little
bummed
out
maybe
im
just
getting
a
little
annoyed
with
bruerys
pricing
or
im
just
expecting
too
much
whatever
it
is
i
think
people
are
overrating
this
beer
a
little
bit
just
because
its
their
way
of
trying
to
compensate
for
the
price
they
paid
for
this
beer
its
a
great
beer
but
the
price
is
just
too
high
for
me
to
seek
it
out
again
where
are
the
stout
characteristics
theyre
basically
nowhere
to
be
found
i
was
intrigued
by
the
idea
of
a
sour
stout
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
one
at
all
its
a
very
good
beer
id
probably
recommend
to
others
to
at
least
try
but
again
the
price
makes
it
too
high
to
make
it
worth
returning
to
at
least
for
the
next
few
years
and
whenever
i
do
get
it
again
ill
be
aging
it
a
couple
years
or
so
to
see
how
it
turns
out
im
surprised
by
all
the
love
for
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
drinkable
but
not
much
else
if
the
stout
character
was
more
evident
then
this
beer
may
have
been
more
interesting
as
it
is
i
finished
the
bottle
myself
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
one
again

one

aged
beers2035
750mlthey
offer
a
beer
mélange

that
is
a
similar
beer
but
with
bigger
stout
character
i
prefer
this
because
its
so
damn
tart
its
like
bourbon
but
sour
just
so
full
bodied
and
original
no
style
to
even
describe
this
masterpiece
of
a
beer
o
i
cant
help
comparing
this
beer
to
jks
funky
metal
which
is
also
a
sour
stout
where
funky
metal
does
a
great
job
of
contrasting
the
roasted
stout
flavors
of
coffee
and
chocolate
against
the
sourness
of
that
beer
tod
does
not
have
such
complexity
and
just
doesnt
measure
up
its
a
good
sour
beer
but
definitely
not
the
best
and
somewhat
pricey
for
what
you
get
really
really
good
i
like
this
beer
fresh
but
the
3
years
of
age
really
do
this
beer
well
25
4
oz
bottle
dark
brown
poured
into
a
20
oz
firestone
glass
smells
like
berry
and
vinegar
very
strong
wine
taste
to
it
i
wanted
to
like
this
so
bad
because
i
had
heard
so
many
good
things
about
it
but
to
me
the
flavor
was
just
nasty
extreme
sour
taste
was
so
present
that
i
could
not
get
around
it
to
decide
what
the
other
flavors
were
made
it
through
about
34
through
the
bottle
and
then
it
became
drain
pour
and
at
19
99
a
bottle
that
hurt
if
you
like
wine
this
might
be
better
suited
for
you
but
for
me
i
cant
recommend
it
to
a
beer
drinker
needless
to
say
i
will
not
be
buying
this
anytime
soon
sorry
bruery
thumbs
down
i
was
nicely
surprised
by
this
ale
i
assumed
it
would
be
similar
to
jp
obscrura
but
i
was
wrong
this
is
more
a
dark
fruited
sour
over
a
sour
stout
its
a
bit
pricey
but
a
sour
folks
need
to
try
overall
very
good
not
quite
to
amazing
but
very
nice
amazing
one
of
my
favorites
o
an
awesome
very
drinkable
sour
no
much
stout
characteristic
here
other
than
the
color
did
not
detect
much
oak
either
this
bottle
was
2014
release
still
have
a
2013
release
curious
to
see
what
an
extra
year
in
the
bottle
will
yield
i
need
to
taste
this
next
to
oude
tart
because
i
swear
its
the
same
beer
if
not
extremely
similar
i
have
had
this
on
draft
and
in
a
bottle
now
i
want
to
love
it
but
i
just
dont
get
any
stout
whatsoever
very
very
sour
as
sours
go
i
have
had
better
overall
this
is
a
well
done
tart
wild
ale
if
you
can
come
to
terms
with
the
price
20
12
for
750
ml
it
is
certainly
worth
trying
not
my
usual
style
most
interesting
beer
of
the
year
tart
is
understated
reminiscent
of
biting
into
a
lemon
but
not
as
strong
more
like
wild
cherry
tart
oak
aged
but
subtle
like
carolina
style
pork
bbq
without
the
spice

very
well

the
best
american
sour
ive
had
creative
in
making
it
a
dark
stout
like
and
sour
at
the
same
time
fine
and
complex
so
much
so
that
its
a
classic
od
this
was
a
pretty
nice
stout
sour
and
complimented
by
those
robust
stout
flavours
but
perhaps
dominated
by
that
sourness
all
the
flavours
seemed
to
come
together
to
form
a
pretty
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
2013

pours
the
color

expresses
tart

and
roasty
malt
taste
is
tart
however
theres
a
dark

profile
but
it
is
really
just
in
the
background
theres
also
a
salty
quality
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
and
slightly
puckering
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
it
needs
an
identity
it
falls
somewhere
between
a
dark
sour
and
sour
stout
overall
this
is
just
so
different
im
not
getting
any
stoutness
really
but
the
sourness
is
there
in
abundance
good
because
it
is
so
different
but
for
the
price
i
probably
wouldnt
shell
out
another

get

going
and
this
one
is
a
stud
as
far
as
im
concerned
big
fan
of
the
bruery
and
this
is
outstanding
maybe
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
tasted
wine
like
even
old
wine
like
fruit
with
gobs
of
acidity
leaning
your
palate
and
bringing
you
back
for
more
the
aromas
of
red
fruit
and
cherry
and
the
perfect
carbonation
make
this
a
top
10
all
time
sour
not
sure
when
i
had
picked
this
one
up
but
was
excited
to
give
it
a
try
split
it
with
my
beer
guru
almost
no
head
at
all
on
this
one
but
the
smell
was
unreal
absolutely
popped
taste
was
awesome
but
it
will
certainly
make
you
pucker
so
you
better
like
tart
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
must
try
and
one
i
hope
to
enjoy
again
overall
rather
nice
really
i
would
drink
it
again
for
you
for
all
of
you
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
thin
overall
tasty
good
beer
but
i
cant
find
anything
about
this
other
than
the
darkness
that
evokes
thoughts
of
stouts
plan
on
sharing
if
you
have
a
large
bottle
this
is
definitely
not
something
i
would
be
able
to
drink
in
one
sitting
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
sours
but
no
match
for
rrbc
supplication
or
consecration
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
i
think
i
like
it
more
than
oude
tart
incredible
mouth
watering
saliva
creating
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
love
sour
and
i
love
stout
and
this
one
took
it
all
the
way
its
hard
to
find
and
a
bit
expensive
but
sooo
worth
it
its
my
special
day
beer
dark
like
a
stout
but
incredibly
light
tasting
nearing
an
ale
in
feel
smell
is
very
alluring
draws
you
in
with
a
sour
hint
and
then
slaps
you
once
youve
put
it
in
your
mouth
makes
my
mouth
water
ive
had
others
from
the
same
brewer
and
they
are
all
good
but
the
stout
is
by
far
my
favorite
overall
a
delicious
beer
if
you
like
styles
that
dont
hide
their
sour
characteristics
i
wouldnt
come
into
this
one
expecting
much
from
the
stout
side
of
the
equationreally
the
stout
provides
more
in
the
way
of
color
and
appearance
than
it
does
with
the
aroma
and
flavor
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
given
the
fact
that
the
bruery
doesnt
distribute
to
my
area
but
it
is
a
tasty
beer
to
be
sure
some
orange
goop
had
collected
around
the
rim
of
the
bottle
while
it
was
conditioning
and
i
got
it
on
my
fingers
when
i
opened
the
bottle
the
beer
is
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
a
fizzy
head
that
disappears
immediately
plenty
of
carbonation
bubbles
are
left
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
vinegary
with
hints
of
grape
and
cherry
after
a
bit
of
a
sweet
fruit
taste
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
the
taste
explodes
with
potent
sourness
it
finishes
with
a
bready
yeast
taste
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
watery
mouthfeel
is
good
big
sticky
sour
feel
that
is
cut
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
perfection
complex
strong
from
start
to
finish
biting
acidity
with
huge
beautiful
full
flavor
to
back
it
up
i
would
seriously
trade
one
of
my
cousins
for
a
bottle
of
this
but
we
dont
see
each
other
very
often
so
its
fine
definitely
not
for
the
meek
nice
dark
lambic
style
beer
impressively
sour
but
enough
good
flavour
around
the
edges
to
keep
it
interesting
and
appealing
i
see
this
as
a
flanders
red
turn
oud
bruin
turn
sour
porter
in
the
most
unique
and
seductive
way
possible
its
a
procession
into
a
direction
that
allows
its
darker
side
to
assist
in
its
sour
dryness
simply
sublime
at
every
turn
o
it
was
not
what
i
expected
but
it
was
still
very
good
just
dont
expect
a
stout
overall
yes
this
is
good
stuff
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
the
bruery
this
is
sharp
intense
and
unrepentant
the
darkness
doesnt
come
through
all
that
much
but
then
the
colour
is
just
impressive
yep
well
done
sour
stout
yes
please
i
was
sold
before
i
even
tasted
it
poured
from
bottle
into
snifter
appears
light
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
roasted
chocolate
aromas
first
sip
annihilates
your
tastebuds
with
a
level
of
sour
that
would
make
a
warheads
lips
pucker
the
chocolatemocha
flavors
oddly
pair
nicely
with
the
intense
sour
absolutely
delicious
o
a
very
very
fine
brew
i
sampled
it
with
my
wife
and
she
really
enjoyed
this
im
a
bit
surprised
at
the
malts
lesser
role
here
though
it
could
be
that
it
was
all
that
it
could
do
to
stave
off
the
funky
acetic
acid
onslaught
this
ones
still
all
about
the
sour
it
just
looks
dark
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
hit
a
bigger
serving
after
missing
out
on
this
at
gabf
last
year
o
excellent
sour
easy
drinker
o
this
is
a
lot
drier
and
more
sour
than
i
expected
its
good
but
a
little
more
stout
maltiness
and
barrel
presence
would
make
the
beer
more
interesting
o
an
interesting
mix
with
the
dark
characteristics
and
the
sour
coming
together
o
alone
in
its
class
in
my
opinion
la
folie
and
crooked
stave
are
great
wild
sour
beers
but
this
is
pretty
darn
close
to
a
masterpiece
nye
bottle
share
at
proof
deepest
of
opaque
browns
with
a
thin
whitetan
head
and
thin
tan
collar
aroma
is
like
a
port
dark
fruit
deep
red
wine
some
woodiness
taste
is
extremely
tart
vinegary
almost
im
getting
some
of
the
wine
like
characteristics
with
some
roasted
malt
too
very
interesting
flavor
medium
carbonation
and
mediumthick
body
overallnot
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
with
the
subtle
tobacco
coming
in
second
i
definitely
did
not
expect
that
o
super
tart
but
very
excellent
flavor
one
if
the
better
sour
bruery
beers
to
date
rereview
somewhat
surprised
at
how
generally
accurate
my
original
review
was
i
think
this
beer
could
be
pale
and
taste
just
as
good
so
in
a
certain
way
im
not
sure
where
using
roasted
malts
is
a
big
part
of
the
beer
overall
rating
increased
regardless
finally
i
have
been
after
this
one
for
a
long
time
what
a
rare
treat
a
sour
stout
not
too
many
of
these
on
the
market
its
got
a
velvety
textured
almost
black
pour
without
a
ton
of
visible
carbonation
but
just
under
an
inch
of
fairly
robust
tannish
head
the
nose
is
sour
i
mean
real
sour
as
sour
as
anything
ive
smelled
save
maybe
their
motherfunker
the
sour
trumps
the
blackness
of
the
stout
and
the
chocolate
malt
roasted
barley
and
barrel
are
all
sort
of
muted
behind
the
acidity
and
lactic
funk
of
the
nose
here
the
taste
is
a
little
more
in
balance
and
it
starts
off
dark
and
roasty
as
expected
i
get
subtle
sweetness
spice
and
more
complex
grain
but
before
i
have
time
to
contemplate
any
of
that
it
transforms
instantly
into
a
sour
bomb
not
overly
acidic
like
some
bruery
sours
but
softly
feeling
brutally
sour
if
you
can
imagine
such
a
sensation
the
huge
body
of
this
beer
and
its
really
dark
malty
earthiness
keep
the
sour
in
check
just
long
enough
to
form
a
really
intriguing
flavor
profile
it
is
truly
different
like
nothing
else
ive
had
the
stout
itself
reminds
me
a
lot
of
darkness
with
some
cherry
and
other
fruit
in
the
finish
the
sour
here
plays
on
those
fruit
notes
and
carries
it
away
great
idea
brilliantly
executed
the
bruery
has
a
real
knack
for
doing
that
which
is
why
i
will
always
come
up
with
the
money
to
try
their
new
stuff
especially
the
sours
and
wilds
this
is
a
treasure
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
worth
getting
when
its
available
as
far
as
wild
ales
go
this
one
is
pretty
good
with
an
interesting
mix
of
ingredients
a
dark
body
with
a
tanned
head
that
falls
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
the
nose
starts
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
but
transitions
quickly
to
tart
sourness
with
lots
of
acidic
citrus
the
taste
is
mouthpuckering
sour
a
bit
of
coffee
and
a
touch
salty
the
finish
is
dry
dry
dry
and
sour
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
one
note
overall
solid
beer
if
you
like
sours
the
tartness
is
well
blended
with
the
stout
flavor
and
leaves
a
nice
finish
that
doesnt
destroy
your
mouth
like
other
sours
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
sour
and
tart
aspects
are
on
point
havent
had
this
one
fresh
so
not
entirely
sure
how
the
year
made
it
taste
but
it
works
overall
i
have
no
idea
what
the
hell
im
drinking
but
its
incredibly
complex
and
tasty
first
sour
stout
experience
definitely
was
a
good
one
going
to
have
to
pick
up
as
many
of
these
as
possible
while
theyre
still
on
the
shelves
o
this
beer
was
quite
good
for
not
knowing
what
to
expect
i
regret
not
splitting
the
bottle
with
anyone
but
then
again
no
one
else
wanted
any
i
would
recommend
sharing
this
one
with
friends
i
absolutely
love
sours
so
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
definitely
one
of
the
most
sour
ive
ever
tried
the
slight
roastyness
works
nicely
here
recommendable
taste
was
very
very
sour
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
sour
beers
but
this
one
was
way
out
of
balance
the
souring
agent
completely
took
over
and
left
very
little
to
taste
i
really
was
searching
for
the
fruit
that
i
could
smell
but
it
was
buried
beneath
the
sourness
pretty
let
down
given
the
price
and
reputation
of
the
bruery
i
can
name
20
sour
beers
that
are
better
than
this
one
maybe
aging
would
help
but
i
doubt
it
a
really
nice
beer
not
terribly
complex
but
a
nice
unlikely
combination
of
styles
o
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
kind
of
vinegarsweetness
that
something
like
dutchess
has
its
not
a
flandersstyle
sour
this
is
a
wild
ale
and
it
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
o
as
usual
pretty
good
stuff
from
the
bruery
theres
definitely
enough
sourness
to
make
any
sour
lover
happy
not
enough
depth
or
complexity
though
and
the
appearance
left
much
to
be
desired
would
recommend
i
want
to
drink
more
and
more
of
this
regardless
of
the
base
beer
when
the
bruery
reach
for
their
special
magical
blend
of
bacterias
and
yeasts
you
know
how
that
movie
is
going
to
end
sour
delicious
and
pricey
these
guys
have
done
for
funk
what
scorsese
has
for
de
niro
and
dicaprio
or
burton
for
depp
they
work
together
almost
exclusively
and
the
genius
of
one
has
no
doubt
made
the
other
a
star
the
beer
pours
a
dark
and
mysterious
black
with
a
small
head
of
very
light
very
small
tan
bubbles
that
fizzle
away
like
soda
water
leaving
only
the
slightest
of
tan
rings
around
the
glass
the
head
leaves
small
tendrils
of
lacing
in
body
the
beer
is
almost
visible
to
the
eye
but
is
just
dark
enough
that
no
light
shows
through
the
body
appears
free
of
particles
on
the
nose
this
beer
is
certainly
tart
and
funky
nice
cherry
fruitleather
scents
waft
over
the
nose
with
touches
of
cocoa
raisins
dates
and
plums
touches
of
horse
blanket
and
sweet
sweat
can
occasionally
be
smelled
and
as
the
beer
warms
the
cocoa
become
a
touch
richer
and
adds
light
vanilla
and
oak
to
the
mix
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
puckering
in
its
acidity
with
bright
malic
acid
and
other
acids
singing
on
the
tongue
touches
of
sweetness
appear
in
the
front
of
the
taste
alongside
the
rich
and
funky
fruit
flavors
but
this
is
dried
out
in
the
finish
touches
of
tannic
bitters
can
be
sensed
and
grow
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
giving
a
nice
herbal
bitterness
to
the
very
back
of
the
senses
there
is
even
a
touch
of
funky
salinity
in
this
beer
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sharp
green
apple
and
cherry
leather
with
mingling
plum
and
raisin
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouth
is
met
with
a
big
rush
of
tannic
oak
and
soft
vanilla
alongside
sweeter
cherries
with
just
a
brushing
of
brown
sugar
and
cocoa
the
finish
seems
quick
but
actually
lasts
for
quite
a
while
with
slightly
astringent
oak
tart
cherries
and
soft
roast
malt
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
with
a
puckering
and
sharp
mouthfeel
that
softens
as
the
beer
warms
carbonation
is
middling
in
this
beer
with
a
touch
of
sharpness
as
well
the
beer
finishes
feeling
smooth
and
almost
velvety
the
mouth
is
left
dry
and
puckering
overall
its
a
touch
too
tart
but
then
again
its
called
the
tart
of
darkness
i
want
a
little
more
in
terms
of
stout
qualities
but
i
have
gotten
that
from
other
bottles
of
tart
of
darkness
the
funk
is
rich
and
awesome
in
this
beer
and
the
complexity
of
the
beer
is
deep
bringing
new
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
i
love
the
use
of
oak
in
this
beer
and
like
the
rich
funk
and
tartness
personally
i
would
want
to
turn
the
funk
up
and
the
tartness
down
but
that
is
not
what
this
beer
is
about
this
bottle
is
totally
worth
its
cost
try
it
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
very
thin
ring
of
tan
head
it
certainly
looks
like
a
stout
scents
of
apple
cider
vinegar
balsamic
vinegar
and
red
wine
with
slight
roast
malt
the
nose
is
certainly
sour
not
quite
a
ris
in
scent
this
carries
over
into
the
flavor
its
apple
cider
vinegar
sour
funk
red
wine
and
grapeskin
without
many
other
flavors
it
tastes
quite
sour
and
vinous
with
none
of
the
flavors
i
expected
in
a
ris
its
not
bad
an
excellent
sour
for
sure
but
less
of
a
ris
it
was
quite
nice
for
what
it
was
indeed
it
was
excellent
mouthfeel
is
heavy
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
mouthfeel
it
feels
like
both
a
stout
and
a
sour
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
good
combination
of
a
sour
and
a
ris
though
the
sour
overwhelms
much
of
the
stout
qualities
id
recommend
it
if
you
like
sours
but
if
you
want
a
stout
look
elsewhere
tried
this
one
at
the
tasting
room
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
with
some
ruby
around
the
edges
and
a
light
khaki
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
sour
chocolates
strangely
enough
and
some
light
vinegar
that
i
get
from
the
sour
beers
flavor
follows
with
a
lightly
chocolates
sour
flavor
rather
easy
on
the
taste
buds
it
finishes
with
chocolate
on
the
way
down
but
leaves
a
tinge
of
sour
lingering
on
the
to
hue
medium
bodied
very
unique
and
they
somehow
made
this
work
nicely
would
like
to
have
this
one
again
the
body
was
very
thin
especially
for
a
stout
but
did
have
a
clean
dry
finish
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
went
down
smooth
and
easy
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
but
probably
not
worth
the
21tax
price
tag
probably
worth
trying
but
that
will
depend
on
your
wallet
o
excellent
sour
stout
probably
not
a
good
choice
as
a
first
sour
ale
this
one
definitely
gets
my
attention
from
the
first
sip
compares
well
to
some
of
the
best
local
sours
ive
had
from
wicked
weed
in
asheville
ill
buy
this
one
again
750
ml

2013
edition

printed
on
the
bottle
i
assume
thats
the
bottled
on
date
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
either
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
tart
cherries
dark
fruit
roasted
malt
and
some
vinegar
it
tastes
like
tart
cherries
dark
fruit
vinegar
lemon
peel
vinegar
and
some
roasted
malt
and
blackberries
its
more
of
a
sour
brew
than
a
stout
not
that
im
complaining
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
brew
i
might
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
soon
18
99
a
bottle
its
pricey
but
tasty
oanother
excellent
sour
from
the
bruery
they
maybe
expensive
but
they
are
worth
at
least
one
try
with
many
being
worth
repeat
purchases
o
tod
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
bruery
the
sour
stout
style
is
still
a
lesser
known
style
but
the
bruery
executes
it
very
well
at
7
for
this
years
batch
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
approachable
another
job
well
done
the
bruery
tart
of
darkness
4
55
overall
an
exceptional
flemish
red
overall
good
but
i
would
like
to
get
more
of
the
stout
as
far
as
sour
stouts
go
i
prefer
jolly
pumpkins
rendition
overall
really
different
i
like
it
though
i
think
it
might
be
a
little
bit
too
sour
for
the
stout
notes
to
work
ive
found
that
the
bruery
is
really
good
with
their
stouts
and
sours
overall
as
well
as
emulating
their
favorite
pastries
into
the
beer
format
this
does
all
three
quite
well
and
im
wondering
if
the
extra
booze
on
this
vintage
increased
the
sweetness
and
in
the
process
enhanced
a
lot
of
the
malty
and
fruity
nuances
that
this
beer
has
always
had
this
was
unbelievably
refreshing
to
drink
after
a
sequence
of
oppressive
and
mediocre
sours
that
night
fantastic
stuff
im
cellaring
a
bottle
and
cant
wait
to
see
what
it
turns
into
by
next
year
oif
you
like
it
sour
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
want
your
stout
to
have
a
kick
of
funk
or
sour
bite
maybe
look
elsewhere
because
this
thing
is
heavy
on
pucker
and
light
on
roasty
malt
in
fact
even
though
i
like
my
beers
sour
this
is
almost
too
much
to
the
point
that
it
is
a
bit
simple
and
not
complex
enough
but
still
i
enjoy
this
beer
i
like
the
grapecherry
combo
and
there
is
just
enough
stout
character
to
keep
it
from
being
a
complete
stomachburning
monster
o
one
seriously
awesome
beer
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
transforms
so
much
during
a
sip
the
balance
of
malt
and
sour
is
surprisingly
amazing
and
i
am
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
def
worth
the
price
im
happy
with
it
usually
when
i
drink
a
sour
my
mouth
becomes
acquainted
and
we
move
past
the
initial
pucker
im
at
the
end
of
my
first
glass
and
i
think
i
just
had
a
shiver
run
through
me
whoa
prior
to
this
the
only
sour
stout
i
had
tried
was
funk
metal
from
jester
king
which
was
solid
and
had
more
characteristics
of
a
stout
this
however
is
very
sour
im
reminded
that
its
a
stout
solely
by
the
color
of
the
beer
in
my
glass
i
have
been
seriously
tasting
the
barrelaged
stouts
recently
i
like
the
ghostly
presence
of
the
stout
i
am
tasting
in
this
the
sour
just
dominates
the
bruery
seems
to
do
well
blending
their
brews
and
that
has
been
successful
for
them
i
really
want
to
taste
this
stout
by
itself
or
at
least
with
something
else
lessintense
than
a
19
brew
the
sourstout
was
a
great
experiment
and
i
love
this
beer
i
think
but
i
think
making
the
melange
3
with
the
black
tuesday
was
a
more
pristine
act
kind
of
like
marrying
a
catholic
with
a
protestant
rather
than
a
catholic
with
a
muslim
overly
a
exceptional
sour
beer
and
by
far
the
best
sour
stout
i
have
ever
had
o
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
wild
sour
beer
its
sweeter
and
more
full
than
your
typical
light
sour
beer
without
being
overly
malty
that
being
said
this
isnt
every
sourheads
cupoftea
it
doesnt
have
the
oak
barrel
notes
that
other
sours
typically
have
and
i
missed
that
in
this
beer
overall
i
think
bruery
accomplished
what
it
set
out
to
do
o
really
fantastically
tart
and
sour
brew
with
light
overpowered
stout
flavors
total
4450
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
wild
ale
the
bruery
prides
itself
on
oddly
delicious
brews
and
this
one
ranks
on
the
recommended
list
a
near
perfect
beer
o
disgraceful
dont
call
this
a
sour
stout
and
charge
23
a
bottle
if
this
were
a
regular
sour
i
could
understand
but
this
was
devoid
of
any

the
bruery
strikes
again
another
really
good
sour
ale
not
quite
as
jawdroppingly
incredible
as
oude
tart
and
sour
in
the
rye
it
is
still
a
very
wellcrafted
inventive
american
wild
ale
that
blends
two
disparate
styles
in
a
really
tasteful
and
tasty
way
very
good
and
worth
the
high
price
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
like
a
gudenband
on
steroids
very
interesting
and
i
hope
to
get
to
try
again
o
this
ones
about
as
tart
as
they
come
with
a
strong
acidic
bit
and
good
bit
of
fruitiness
sort
of
flanders
red
that
come
of
the
rails
except
that
there
is
some
stout
character
to
back
up
the
flavors
the
sour
stout
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
style
thanks
in
part
to
the
few
exceptional
brewers
making
the
style
this
is
my
first
sour
beer
and
was
certainly
not
what
i
expected
after
reading
reviews
here
maybe
someone
can
recommend
something
more
amenable
as
an
introduction
into
the
world
of
sour
beers
for
someone
hesitant
to
try
and
select
on
their
own
again
big
lactic
flavors
and
pretty
sour
but
the
stout
aspect
comes
through
enough
to
make
it
super
interesting
these
flavors
somehow
work
out
and
blend
rather
than
being
a
mess
like
some
might
imagine
from
a
sour
stout
o
first
offering
from
the
highly
reguarded
bruery
and
not
disappointed
it
delivers
exactly
as
promised
dark
and
tart
will
admit
big
fan
of
sour
beers
in
general
and
will
surely
drink
this
again
overall
a
highly
overhyped
overrated
beer
7
bucks
for
a
6
ounce
pour
or
25
bucks
a
750
no
thanks
this
is
not
in
the
same
league
as
other
sours
deserving
that
price
i
just
dont
understand
the
burery
hype
overpriced
and
under
delivered
i
think
this
beer
was
done
as
a
sour
mash
and
not
with
bacteria
and
wood
aged
i
think
this
would
have
been
a
crazy
awesome
beer
had
it
been
done
like
a
traditional
sour
in
wood
barrels
but
the
layers
of
flavor
and
complexity
are
missing
for
me
o
an
excellent
aged
sour
nice
oak
flavors
like
a
fine
aged
balsamic
vinegar
overall
i
go
for
big
malty
stouts
and
english
barleys
not
a
big
fan
of
sours
but
this
beer
is
exceptional
o
very
drinkable
for
7
first
time
tying
something
from
the
bruery
and
i
was
pretty
impressed
a
nice
balence
of
oak
smoked
maltiness
and
sourness
the
price
tag
served
from
bottle
into
a
bruery
tulip
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
massive
tart
acidic
wood
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
massive
tart
liquorices
wood
and
subtle
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
so
they
put
tart
in
the
name
how
tart
can
it
really
be
holy
christ
i
should
have
visited
my
dentist
after
having
this
one
to
have
my
enamel
checked
because
im
pretty
sure
i
had
none
left
after
the
first
sip
while
being
really
tart
it
did
still
manage
to
hang
on
to
some
other
smaller
aspects
to
help
try
to
balance
this
one
out
unfortunately
it
just
fell
a
little
short
definitely
worth
your
time
trying
if
you
love
sours
but
dont
unleash
this
on
your
unsuspecting
friends
unless
you
want
a
good
laugh
or
are
just
plain
cruel
7
750ml

i
need
a
tulip
like
now
o
worth
the
20
price
for
a
special
occasion
i
wont
buy
this
beer
again
unless
something
good
is
coming
up
though
the
bruery
is
doing
good
things
overall
very
nice
sour
which
i
am
definitely
buying
again
and
cellaring
some
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
a
heavier
beer
but
its
not
and
somewhat
lacks
in
complexity
because
its
so
tough
to
get
through
the
sourness
to
taste
other
flavors
still
loved
it
though
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
certainly
oneofakind
but
its
not
balanced
enough
for
me
its
probably
the
most
sour
beer
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
and
the
stout
flavor
profile
is
unrecognizable
if
you
like
your
sours
to
be
sour
and
unbalanced
this
is
your
beer
with
a
bottle
aged
a
couple
years
the
aroma
is
extremely
tart
and
sour
along
with
the
flavor
at
first
you
may
get
some
of
the
stoutroast
character
but
the
sourness
really
just
stands
out
definitely
buy
again
o
awesome

overall
this
is
another
great
sour
from
the
bruery
more
complex
than
most
sours
ive
tried
well
i
think
this
was
the
first
sour
stout
that
i
had
ever
had
and
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
but
it
turns
out
to
be
much
more
sour
than
stout
and
man
oh
man
is
it
sour
like
face
squisingly
tart
tart
and
crisp
as
pretty
much
any
other
sour
ive
had
funky
fermented
smell
lemon
apples
and
the
taste
follows
almost
exactly
the
only
downside
is
that
it
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
gritty
and
weird
lots
of
carbonation
not
much
of
the
stout
comes
through
some
mild
malts
if
you
really
look
for
it
the
sour
overpowers
pretty
much
everything
else
but
not
in
a
bad
way
very
good
very
sour
and
puckering
salivary
glands
get
working
into
overdrive
traces
of
roasted
malt
from
the
stout
base
and
some
vinous
dark
fruit
heavily
acidic
up
front
and
lightly
drying
in
the
finish
overall
enjoyable
in
small
doses
though
the
sourness
seems
a
little
one
dimensional
and
overpowering
at
times
this
is
just
amazing
the
roast
works
very
well
with
the
good
amount
of
tart
love
the
berries
too
since
its
so
prevalent
and
they
tastesmell
so
juicy
o
this
beer
is
very
intense
when
it
comes
to
the
level
of
sourness
it
was
quite
like
being
punched
in
the
head
at
the
first
sip
it
takes
a
bit
to
acclimate
to
how
sour
this
beer
is
but
its
still
quite
good
a
very
nice
twist
on
the
style
of
a
stout
and
of
an
american
wild
ale
a
delicious
and
drinkable
sour
brew
for
anyone
thats
acquired
a
taste
for
such
things
serve
cold
theres
plenty
of
flavor
with
warm
weather
this
is
completely
refreshing

big

and
i
dig
it
but
expecting
more
of
a
stout
o
phenomenal
sour
brew
every
sip
as
sour
as
the
last
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
it
d
the
drinkability
here
is
incredible
wish
i
could
drink
this
one
every
single
day
one
too
it
pours
out
a
very
dark
tart
with
yeast
sediments
laid
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
if
poured
correctly
sours
arent
for
everyone
as
some
lack
the
tastes
for
it
but
if
you
want
a
top
sour
this
sour
will
make
your
pallet
numb

wouldnt
pass
a

this

all
around
fantastic
complexity
and
balance
of
flavors
with
big
sourness
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
even
with
the
big
acidity
this
was
hardly
representing
a
stout
in
malt
backboneno
idea
on
age
but
damn
was
this
insane
as
a
sour
in
general
i
like
this
one
and
it
has
some
interesting
aspects
but
i
dont
know
if
id
want
another
considering
the
price
tag
worth
a
try
and
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
d
very
sour
very
complex
and
oddly
drinkable
im
more
enthralled
by
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
but
both
are
quite
good
overall
very
good
beer
may
be
a
little
over
the
top
sour
even
for
the
style
but
flavorful
and
a
must
try
overall
this
is
an
extremely
interesting
beer
i
do
not
however
like
the
sheer
intensity
of
the
sourness
i
feel
this
sourness
completely
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
beers
flavor
profile
that
is
seen
largely
upfront
on
the
palate
the
sourness
does
not
entirely
dominate
every
other
aspect
of
this
beer
but
it
is
certainly
the
leading
aspect
of
it
the
sourness
still
has
many
flavors
underneath
it
of
some
oak
chocolate
and
red
grapes
but
it
upstages
the
malt
body
in
conclusion
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
the
sourness
turned
down
a
tad
with
that
being
said
i
have
held
on
to
this
bottle
for
about
6
months
so
im
not
sure
if
this
would
be
any
less
sour
when
its
fresh
poured
out
looking
pretty
good
nice
dark
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
retention
is
minimal
just
leaving
a
ring
around
the
glass
there
wasnt
much
lacing
on
this
brew
either
the
smell
of
packed
with
sour
notes
there
is
some
oak
in
there
as
well
the
aroma
of
some
dark
fruits
come
out
but
are
quickly
overwhelmed
by
the
strength
of
the
sourness
the
taste
is
exactly
what
the
label
says
its
tart
with
a
bit
of
the
dark
malts
in
there
to
balance
it
out
a
little
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
tart
and
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
overall
its
a
decent
beer
not
worth
the
price
tag
in
my
opinion
but
was
nice
to
share
with
some
people
poured
into
a
sampler
glass
the
ale
was
an
odd
black
color
with
hints
of
magenta
streaking
through
the
body
the
aroma
was
a
of
sour
fruits
mostly
red
berries
such
a
cherries
cranberries
and
perhaps
pomegranate
in
the
initial
taste
is
where
this
beer
earns
some
serious
points
like
a
jolt
of
electricity
one
immediately
notices
the
tart
cherries
other
fruits
can
be
detected
such
as
pomegranate
and
tart
cranberries
the
creamy
vanilla
backbone
that
comes
from
the
oak
aging
rounds
the
ale
out
nicely
it
prevents
the
ale
from
becoming
a
sour
bomb
the
sour
fruit
continues
to
tickle
the
throat
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
slight
warming
sensation
which
seems
unusual
for
a
5
6abv
the
stickiness
of
the
mouthfeel
and
modest
level
of
carbonation
allows
aftertaste
to
linger
nicely
this
may
be
the
best
member
of
the
bruery
line
that
one
can
find
on
store
shelves
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
a
tossup
between
the
aroma
and
the
taste
with
the
latter
winning
by
a
hair
from
the
time
you
crack
the
bottle
you
get
this
insanely
complex
deep
dark
and
wild
aroma
filling
your
nostrils
the
darkness
does
get
a
bit
lost
here
and
if
you
closed
your
eyes
while
whiffing
you
would
be
surprised
at
the
beers
color
when
you
opened
them
the
taste
however
rectifies
this
gap
while
the
funk
takes
up
a
large
and
continuing
portion
of
the
sip
it
leaves
enough
room
for
not
only
the
depth
and
roast
of
the
malts
to
shine
though
but
the
barrel
aging
spent
black
tuesday
barrels
as
well
the
amazing
thing
is
you
can
actually
taste
the
similarities
in
the
wood
with
all
that
inherent
dirt
graphite
and
muskiness
without
the
intense
boozy
heat
all
soaked
into
black
tuesday
this
is
a
fantastic
blend
of
styles
and
is
extremely
well
executed
as
a
warning
the
level
of
tartness
and
pucker
here
are
quite
high
and
if
you
arent
a
big
fan
of
the
style
expect
to
be
shocked
overall
an
exercise
in
excess
the
bruery
takes
it
to
the
next
level
in
every
regard
in
this
batch
of
tart
of
darkness
they
decided
that
aging
a
sour
stout
in
oak
barrels
wasnt
enough
so
decided
to
age
the
next
batch
of
it
in
bourbon
barrels
which
have
previously
held
their
19
stout
black
tuesday
craziness
but
it
works
very
well
overall
although
the
roasted
malts
poke
through
a
bit
more
in
the
finish
as
the
ale
warms
up
i
do
wish
that
they
poked
through
the
myriad
of
sour
and
barrel
complexities
a
bit
more
assertively
id
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
sour
fan
in
a
heart
beat
i
couldnt
ask
for
a
more
interesting
beer
to
drink
for
my
50th
review
overall
i
wouldnt
have
thought
the
sour
and
stout
characteristics
would
complement
one
another
but
they
end
up
working
well
together
its
a
good
beer
thats
worth
trying
though
given
the
price
point
im
not
sure
its
good
enough
to
justify
future
purchases
shop
near
me
decided
to
release
some
stuff
it
was
originally
going
to
use
for
a
sampling
so
good
timing
was
mine
that
day
poured
it
with
some
sunday
brunch
with
the
wife
and
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
my
first
sour
stout
it
came
out
dark
but
not
black
hole
dark
more
like
used
motor
oil
through
the
light
the
light
fizz
went
away
very
quickly
i
didnt
notice
anything
having
to
do
with
it
being
a
stout
with
either
smell
or
taste
until
it
was
about
an
hour
in
the
glass
when
some
room
temp
warmth
finally
brought
out
the
faint
smell
of
a
stout
otherwise
it
was
all
sour
cherries
with
a
start
of
tart
with
tart
in
the
middle
and
then
a
strong
finish
of
tartness
its
wicked
sour
but
it
cleans
up
nicely
and
doesnt
leave
any
sort
of
lingering
aftertaste
overall
its
damn
good
but
at
a
pretty
pricey
purchase
level
o
unreal
beer
the
price
tag
is
outrageous
as
youd
expect
but
the
beer
is
so
good
that
you
need
to
try
it
once
o
if
you
can
handle
all
of
the
tartness
this
beer
isnt
that
difficult
because
it
isnt
too
sour
it
is
a
good
beer
to
clean
your
palate
with
o
im
a
fan
of
sour
beers
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
is
a
pretty
intense
amount
of
sourness
and
not
one
for
someone
new
to
the
style
it
is
almost
overwhelming
this
is
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
but
is
one
that
can
be
slowly
sipped
for
enjoyment
y
tastes
like
it
smells
sweet
tarts
predominantly
there
is
a
little
roast
malt
vanilla
in
back
but
more
like
a
bsda
than
a
stout
to
me
not
very
complex
but
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
nice
the
best
part
about
it
is
that
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
but
feel
like
this
could
be
a
fun
style
to
see
other
breweries
try
out
its
rare
to
come
across
something
like
this
that
doesnt
just
end
in
reach
exceeding

o
a
huge
disappointment
drain
pour
for
the
remainder
of
the
bottle
roasted
malts
no
stout
no
bottle
says
suitable
for
aging
up
to
3
years
i
might
try
it
again
but
as
a
taste
and
only
at
three
years
an
amazing
and
unusual
ale
im
glad
we
were
able
to
find
and
enoy
this
one
the
sourness
is
more
than
i
typically
can
take
in
a
sour
ale
but
it
fades
so
quickly
into
such
a
pleasant
roasted
coffee
toffee
and
chocolate
finish
that
i
dont
mind
it
plus
the
tart
grows
on
you
as
you
get
further
through
the
beer
such
that
youre
looking
for
that
next
hit
of
sour
after
it
fades
away
poured
a
pitch
black
body
it
seems
with
one
finger
tan
head
that
died
quick
very
tart
vinous
aroma
cherries
sour
apple
touches
of
oak
and
wood
with
possibly
some
sweet
malt
but
i
didnt
pick
them
up
in
the
smell
taste
is
more
of
the
same
in
terms
of
strong
tart
fruits
like
cherry
sour
apple
maybe
darkblack
druits
as
it
is
a
very
tart
beer
but
a
great
balance
from
oak
and
wood
lets
it
be
a
little
fullerbodied
almost
creamy
one
could
say
and
while
still
a
dry
crisp
finish
and
this
is
a
slow
sipper
mind
you
it
isnt
overly
tart
or
bitter
little
touchs
of
roasted
malts
andor
dark
chocolate
sweetness
seem
to
creep
in
as
well
and
make
the
difference
between
just
a
sour
beerale
and
a
combo
of
sour
and
stout
not
real
experienced
in
this
sub
genre
of
brew
but
this
is
a
quality
beer
def
worth
seeking
it
out
admittedly
sours
are
not
my
thing
but
this
may
start
to
open
that
door
for
me
being
a
fan
of
stouts
i
was
hoping
for
more
roasty
presence
but
it
turned
out
ok
a
strangely
alluring
combination
of
flavors
o
overall
a
very
good
sour
though
i
dont
know
where
they
are
getting
the
stout
part
from
other
than
the
color
its
a
fantastic
beer
thats
not
only
unique
but
done
well
id
love
to
revist
this
again
sometime
d
this
was
bold
and
tart
with
nice
scent
and
taste
and
body
the
finish
was
clean
and
crisp
but
it
must
be
sipped
due
to
extreme
tartness
it
would
probably
age
for
a
long
time
but
doesnt
need
it
since
its
already
solid
fresh
recommended
overall
quite
nice
great
sour
malts
tart
cherry
like
nice
dark
malts
with
caramel
and
that
nice
light
roast
and
rising
coffee
on
the
finish
nice
oak
barrel
fairly
tasty
i
think
i
may
get
more
of
these
o
overall
this
was
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
very
glad
i
have
some
more
of
this
this
bottle
haunted
me
for
weeks
at
the
local
bottle
shop
with
a
20
dollar
price
tag
staring
me
down
i
kept
passing
it
up
finally
i
had
to
give
in
i
knew
id
regret
not
picking
it
up
tart
of
darkness
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tiny
head
the
aroma
is
absolutely
awesome
its
got
a
strong
tart
cherry
thing
going
on
along
with
oak
and
a
vinegar
sourness
the
taste
again
is
fantastic
its
extremely
tart
straight
from
the
getgo
puckeringly
so
theres
a
bit
of
roast
in
the
background
that
quickly
gets
tossed
out
the
window
by
a
very
tart
lemon
juice
thing
going
on
the
finish
is
lingeringly
tart
and
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
overall
tart
of
darkness
is
one
of
my
favorite
sours
ive
had
so
far
and
easily
one
of
the
best
available
in
this
cursed
sour
state
of
florida
this
was
surprisingly
good
and
although
it
feels
a
little
unbalanced
towards
the
dark
cherry
at
times
i
was
pleased
to
find
just
enough
of
that
cocoa
and
roasted
flavors
to
not
only
be
present
but
act
as
an
active
part
of
the
profile
as
well
the
tartness
is
just
mouthwatering
here
at
times
definitely
one
to
check
out
if
you
like
sours
the
best
part
about
it
is
that
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
but
feel
like
this
could
be
a
fun
style
to
see
other
breweries
try
out
its
rare
to
come
across
something
like
this
that
doesnt
just
end
in
reach
exceeding
grasp
o
710
sourness
wow
a
very
surprising
beer
excellent
sour
even
tough
the
dark
malts
play
a
very
small
role
in
this
beer
an
exceptional
sour
very
nice
tart
flavors
and
aromas
with
some
dark
slightly
sweet
flavors
giving
the
whole
thing
the
same
gestalt
as
a
good
balsamic
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
decent
viscosity
and
some
orange
highlights
not
a
bad
head
given
the
style
but
it
does
fade
to
nothing
after
a
bit
a
little
bit
of
spice
complements
the
tangerine
tartness
and
richer
umami
flavors
quite
well
done
and
very
drinkable
i
was
tempted
to
blend
some
with
the
stone
vertical
epic
12
for
a
christmas
trifle
effect
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
about
this
but
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
i
cant
help
but
think
that
bourbon
barrels
would
do
absolutely
fantastic
things
to
this
beer
overall
a
very
unique
and
very
tasty
sour
o
an
awesome
uncompromising
american
wild
its
fresh
lemonade
with
the
sugar
cut
to
110th
of

this
beer
looks
beautiful
but
i
dunno
guys
i
like
funky
and
i
like
sour
loved
the
oude
tart
but
this
is
warheads
sour
if
there
was
ever
a
stout
in
there
it
has
vanished
beneath
the
aggressive
lemonjuicy
sourness
i
dont
see
how
anyone
could
call
this
balancedthe
sour
is
so
strong
that
it
takes
over
everything
seriously
you
could
make
vinaigrette
with
just
this
beer
and
some
olive
oil
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
cream
coloured
head
light
retention
and
ok
lacing
nose
is
tart
dark
berries
some
chocolate
and
even
a
bit
of
roast
perhaps
taste
has
roast
light
smokey
malt
with
tart
berries
character
overlying
these
acidic
finish
and
this
carries
on
for
quite
some
time
medium
body
medium
carbonation
too
tart
for
everyone
else
who
it
was
shared
with
but
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
o
such
an
awesome
brew
all
the
way
around
still
pretty
new
to
the
sour
tasting
comparatively
speaking
but
this
one
is
immensely
sour
and
has
an
awesome
balance
definitely
a
must
try
o
interesting
and
complex
brew
and
at
only
5
6
abv
you
can
enjoy
the
whole
bottle
not
one
i
would
want
a
lot
of
but
i
did
like
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
intense
brew
a
roller
coaster
ride
of
flavor
descends
into
a
dry
finish
that
may
fatigue
the
faint
of
heart
if
theyre
not
careful
would
drink
again
but
would
just
like
to
have
some
forewarning
o
not
going
to
lie
this
is
one
hard
bastard
to
down
by
ones
self
like
sucking
down
24oz
of
lemon
juice
its
level
of
sourness
is
balls
to
the
wall
but
its
range
of
flavor
and
stout
qualites
leave
much
to
be
desired
like
dropping
lemon
juice
into
a
schwarz
bier
thier
flanders
was
a
fine
example
managable
sourness
and
exceptional
to
style
this
was
a
sour
with
a
misleading
stout
labeling
your
gonna
have
to
split
this
with
a
friend
or
two
or
three
overall
an
excellent
beer
even
if
it
wasnt
that
complex
due
to
the
sour
domination
light
to
medium
body
and
heavily
carbonated
but
more
champagne
like
with
ample
fine
carbonation
that
keeps
the
tongue
fresh
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
not
that
interesting
o
would
i
drink
it
everyday
no
but
it
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
and
is
a
nice
change
from
the
standard
beerfare
the
brownblack
ale
characteristics
play
nicely
with
the
sour
fruit
to
keep
them
both
in
check
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
jet
black
pour
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
acidic
vinergary
sour
the
first
sip
is
very
sour
notes
of
cherries
definitely
sour
not
much
stout
the
body
is
medium
highly
acidic
pleasantly
tart
a
very
tasty
sour
a
little
overpriced
imo
at
21
bucks
but
very
tasty
overall
this
beer
is
awesome
a
genre
bender
and
i
appreciate
that
not
a
dull
moment
great
complexity
yet
easy
enough
to
drink
would
gladly
buy
if
i
see
it
for
sale
pours
dark
black
with
brown
edges
and
a
thin
ivory
ring
and
very
wispy
haze
nice
aromas
of
tart
vinegar
cranberries
dark
malt
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
really
nice
definitely
reminds
me
a
bit
of
oude
tart
taste
is
similarly
tart
with
more
vinegar
cranberry
oak
dark
chocolate
and
red
berries
mouthfeel
is
definitely
puckering
with
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
really
neat
beer
always
stoked
to
try
something
different
the
body
sits
an
ink
black
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
the
head
fell
quickly
forming
a
thin
collar
with
some
dots
of
lace
the
nose
is
intensely
sour
tons
of
lactic
sourness
with
black
cherries
oak
cocoa
and
leather
on
the
palate
huge
lactic
acid
and
cherries
assault
the
palate
oak
tannins
leather
cocoa
and
roast
are
all
secondary
medium
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
puckering
finish
extremely
dry
lingering
sour
notes
with
dry
oak
and
mild
roast
this
is
a
winner
the
base
stout
has
been
transformed
considerably
by
the
bugs
this
guy
definitely
lives
up
to
its
name
dark
leathery
brown
with
some
tam
foam
smells
of
molasses
with
a
sour
cherry
and
some
lemon
skin
flavor
is
a
nice
well
less
stout
but
more
brown
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
clean
plumy
lemon
lactic
and
cocoa
coffee
some
vinegrated
character
im
really
impressed
with
how
much
i
like
this
fuck
nice
medium
bodied
with
sharp
and
resonant
carb
with
a
dry
finish
nice
beer
really
nice
beer
o
this
is
an
awesome
sour
with
a
unique
angle
being
a
sour
stout
definitely
a
must
try
for
sour
lovers
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
but
dont
get
them
marketing
it
as
a
sour
stout
when
its
about
99
sour
and
1
stout
well
made
but
definitely
a
sour
still
went
down
very
smooth
a
respectable
beer
considering
the
amount
of
this
they
brewed
this
year
tart
of
darkness
is
hardly
the
bruerys
best
work
but
if
everything
they
make
is
at
least
this
good
from
here
on
out
thats
a
resounding
win
for
the
craft
beer
world
pours
deep
blackbrown
with
a
brown
bubbly
head
that
fizzes
away
quickly
leaving
just
a
ring
nose
is
sour
black
cherries
red
grapes
tart
green
apples
plums
a
bit
of
roastiness
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
there
may
also
be
just
the
slightest
notes
of
oak
in
the
back
the
nose
is
tart
but
not
in
your
face
the
tartness
of
the
flavor
however
is
a
punch
in
your
tongues
face
acidic
without
burning
cherries
plums
some
berries
black
and
maybe
raspberries
too
pears
apples
some
lemon
and
a
hint
of
lime
in
the
aftertaste
the
roasted
malts
and
other
stout
characteristics
are
there
but
hardly
all
the
tart
wild
flavors
are
balanced
ever
so
slightly
by
a
lingering
roastiness
but
its
not
there
nearly
as
much
as
youd
think
for
a
stout
theres
also
a
so
subtle
bit
of
oak
but
again
you
kind
of
have
to
search
for
it
i
love
sours
so
i
love
this
but
i
want
to
find
a
sour
stout
with
a
bit
more
stout
to
it
this
and
jolly
pumpkins
madrugada
obscura
are
very
similar
in
that
the
sour
qualities
dominate
excessively
still
an
excellent
brew
though
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
ive
had
sour
stouts
before
and
hated
them
but
this
was
pretty
tasty
overall
it
is
dark
very
true
and
truly
tart
would
love
to
try
this
again
sometime
i
am
wondering
if
this
could
have
been
better
this
was
just
disappointing
to
me
it
julfilled
its
sour
obligations
but
didnt
do
anything
to
expand
upon
that
aspect
meh
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
the
bruery
to
date
a
nice
blend
of
tart
and
roasty
without
the
overbearing
sweetness
and
aggression
i
expect
from
the
bruery
o
a
nice
sour
overall
not
the
most
complex
but
simple
and
delicious
overall
intensely
complex
and
extremely
well
put
together
its
impressive
how
the
roast
is
present
but
not
astringent
with
the
dry
finish

my
man
ryan
was
raving
about
this
beer
so
i
felt
i
just
had
to
grab
a
bottle
while
i
still
could
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
see
what
the
hubbub
was
about
it
pours
a
deep
blacksienna
nearly
completely
opaque
topped
by
a
fleeting
halffinger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
cocoa
powder
vinegar
tart
berries
light
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
maple
syrup
way
in
the
back
the
taste
leads
with
the
vinegar
rolls
seamlessly
into
some
tart
berries
and
fruits
lots
o
lemon
on
the
backend
then
just
when
you
think
this
is
just
some
sour
some
roast
and
cocoa
soften
things
up
a
bit
before
a
haymaker
of
slightly
metallic
tartness
finishes
things
off
animality
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
decidedly
enjoyable
sour
stout
possibly
the
best
of
the
genre
ive
yet
had
this
is
the
best
sour
stout
ive
ever
had
serious
bonus
points
for
this
and
it
might
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
the
bruery
its
nicely
sour
nicely
tart
and
has
a
nice
malt
base
well
done
overall
an
excellent
wild
ale
that
will
definitely
satisfy
your
tart
urges
highly
recommend
if
you
like
tart
not
avail
here
got
from
hoss
rotation
wish
i
could
get
some
more
to
age
as
id
like
to
see
how
it
develops
o
by
far
the
best
oaked
sour
stout
ive
tried
but
it
was
my
first
also
surprisingly
sour
but
unfortunately
loses
all
stout
qualities
good
sour
bad
stout
o
i
guess
this
is
a
perfect
manifestation
of
the
morbid
american
fascination
with
all
things
sour
in
this
case
gratuitous
pun
inbound
i
guess
it
all
turned
a
little
sour
all
in
all
a
little
too
extreme
for
what
i
think
they
were
going
for
good
effort
but
thats
just
about
everything
i
can
say
really
serving
type
bottle
odfor
21
bucks
750
ml
this
better
be
a
damn
good
beer
it
delivered
it
nearly
reached
my
toptier
level
but
fell
just
short
i
found
it
to
be
delectable
but
it
eversoslightly
faltered
in
terms
of
depth
and
complexity
regardless
i
will
blow
this
back
and
be
happy
quite
the
gem
o
a
really
nice
sour
just
dont
really
see
where
the
stout
comes
into
play
here
consumed
without
seeing
the
color
i
would
never
have
pegged
it
a
sourstout
i
havent
had
too
many
sour
beers
theyre
scarce
in
this
part
of
the
country
but
this
one
is
certainly
the
sourest
beer
i
have
had
to
date
if
youre
a
fan
of
extremely
sour
beers
you
should
seek
this
one
out
and
try
it
at
least
once
if
youve
never
had
a
sour
beer
i
would
not
suggest
making
this
your
first
one
i
found
it
to
be
pleasant
to
drink
but
i
prefer
more
balanced
moderately
sour
beers
this
one
is
so
tart
it
overwhelms
my
palate
i
did
enjoy
it
but
given
the
price
of
this
beer
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
if
i
did
i
would
let
it
age
for
a
while
just
to
see
if
any
of
the
sourness
melded
with
the
other
flavors
a
little
better
o
im
starting
to
love
great
sour
ales
and
this
is
a
great
sour
ale
its
nicely
sour
yet
not
overbearingly
oppressive
in
its
dry
oakiness
a
must
try
just
expect
it
to
be
more
sour
than
stout
othis
beer
somehow
manages
to
come
together
in
a
very
unique
and
interesting
presentation
i
enjoy
the
flavor
profile
but
it
is
almost
too
sour
and
not
balanced
enough
for
all
the
flavors
to
come
out
i
would
have
like
to
have
seen
more
stout
on
this
but
instead
i
feel
like
i
have
just
any
other
wild
ale
dyed
black
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
although
the
thick
layer
of
chunky
offwhite
sediment
that
formst
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
is
a
little
strange
overlooking
that
though
this
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
recommended
oan
interesting
sour
stout
strange
combination
but
it
works
for
me
warning
the
sourness
dominates
this
beer
according
to
the
bottle
this
beer
is
actually
brewed
as
a
stout
before
being
barrel
aged
with
wild
yeasts
however
the
stout
character
is
very
faint
dont
buy
this
beer
expecting
a
stout
overall
a
really
nice
tart
and
complex
sour
i
really
liked
the
mix
of
sour
notes
with
some
bourbon
and
stout
backing
notes
that
were
truly
background
notes
the
low
abv
really
worked
well
too
in
making
the
sour
notes
and
stout
notes
come
together
without
any
harsh
booze
character
very
refreshing
a
drinkable
definitely
worth
the
price
of
a
bottle
glad
i
got
one
to
age
overall
just
not
my
thing
o
a
very
different
sour
offering
that
should
be
tried
at
least
once
the
dark
malt
adds
some
balance
but
is
not
extremely
noticeable
hugely
unique
try
this
beer
the
nose
is
an
5050
even
split
between
roasted
malt
coffee
and
soured
tart
raspberry
cherry
aroma
the
oak
wood
doesnt
register
in
the
smell
until
after
the
glass
has
warmed
up
somewhat
but
when
it
does
the
resulting
combination
in
the
aroma
is
quite
wonderful
to
smell
flavor
is
unfortunately
about
8515
between
sourness
and
stout
which
is
not
as
close
to
the
noses
proportions
as
i
had
hoped
the
bright
and
puckery
sour
acidic
cherry
oak
wood
blast
masks
out
the
great
majority
of
the
roasted
flavor
and
i
am
left
with
a
soured
ale
that
uses
a
whisper
of
roast
as
a
garnish
dont
get
me
wrong
it
works
but
a
bit
more
darkness
on
the
tongue
would
have
been
appreciated
o
overall
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
love
the
idea
but
could
be
a
little
thicker
in
my
opinion
also
a
little
over
priced
overall
this
is
a
good
dark
sour
but
i
have
had
two
better
in
the
last
month
it
is
too
onenoted
and
generically
sour
cherry
brettforward
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
weyerbacher
sour
black
that
had
awesome
red
wine
notes
and
more
roasted
malt
flavor
in
the
background
it
also
lacks
the
sourness
that
capt
lawrence
barrel
select
black
has
which
is
just
crazy
sour
mixed
with
lightly
roasted
malts
this
is
just
a
but
too
generic
for
the
hefty
price
and
wont
be
in
my
regular
rotation
anytime
soon
o
and
with
that
a
new
favorite
emerges
in
the
world
of
sours
even
though
it
was
a
damned
expensive
bottle
and
the
balance
was
shifted
more
toward
sour
than
anything
to
me
every
ounce
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
superb
o
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
the
price
point
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
high
for
simply
a
good
beer
i
would
buy
again
if
this
beer
was
around
14
a
bottle
overall
nice
play
on
sour
stout
less
going
on
than
in
most
stouts
or
sour
ales
but
to
such
a
degree
that
it
fails
to
be
a
good
beer
i
know
the
bruery
can
do
better
than
this
but
id
buy
another
bottle
if
the
price
was
right
overall
a
unique
beer
reminds
me
most
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
enjoyable
and
tasty
but
not
sure
it
justified
the
high
price
tag
o
overall
i
liked
this
a
lot
i
hadnt
heard
great
things
about
batch
1
which
i
have
yet
to
try
but
have
1
bottle
of
and
had
heard
good
things
about
batch
2
and
i
was
very
happy
with
it
maybe
the
bt
barrels
helped
this
one
but
it
is
a
very
sour
beer
with
roasted
notes
to
it
and
one
of
the
better
sour
stouts
ive
had
glad
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
and
looking
forward
to
trying
the
2
batches
side
by
side
othis
pretty
much
just
drinks
like
an
american
wild
ale
with
a
twist
of
darkness
to
it
its
freaking
awesome
its
good
enough
that
im
going
out
and
buying
a
few
more
bottles
if
i
can
find
them
its
awesome
the
tastes
are
powerful
and
great
tasting
3
5
d
im
starting
to
feel
that
the
bruery
should
start
making
artisanal
vinegars
instead
of
wild
ales
most
of
the
stuff
they
make
is
acetic
acidforward
while
still
good
im
more
of
a
fan
of
complex
funk
which
is
why
i
choose
3f
over
cantillon
most
of
the
time
in
any
case
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
since
this
will
definitely
scratch
the
acetic
sour
itch
that
i
get
occasionally
pours
out
what
looks
to
be
brown
but
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
lovely
reddish
hue
little
head
which
dissipated
quickly
prunes
and
coffee
on
the
nose
with
of
course
the
wonderful
vinegar
blast
of
a
well
made
sour
nice
palate
cleansing
astringency
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
nice
i
nice
bubble
on
the
mouthfeel
with
a
little
syrupy
coating
i
love
sours
and
this
is
very
good
one
o
excellent
beer
and
very
interesting
as
well
glad
to
finally
try
it
good
out
hopbrizio
o
a
solid
sour
that
is
very
tasty
i
had
a
small
sample
at
a
tasting
about
a
year
ago
and
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
of
this
but
now
i
am
really
liking
this
beer
only
real
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
i
would
have
liked
more
of
a
sour
stout
and
not
just
a
sour
o
a
truly
interesting
beer
and
one
that
i
highly
enjoy
would
recommend
will
drink
again
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
in
a
blind
taste
testing
i
dont
think
you
would
initially
be
able
to
tell
how
dark
this
brew
is
but
as
it
warms
up
and
more
sips
are
taken
the
darkness
reveals
itself
with
some
characteristics
that
really
play
nice
with
the
vinoustart
cherry
elements
sour
fans
will
really
enjoy
this
get
out
there
and
get
yourself
a
bottle
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
m
medium
bodied
but
not
like
stout
at
all
watery
pours
a
dark
brown
light
rusty
copper
tint
some
particles
little
head
scent
leads
with
vinegar
tartness
light
roast
cherry
and
dark
bread
taste
brings
a
quick
hit
of
vinegar
then
some
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
muted
cherry
dark
bread
light
oak
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
taste
develops
more
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
solid
beer
o
this
is
a
good
american
wild
ale
not
a
ton
of
complexity
after
getting
over
the
lacto
white
wine
and
oak
flavors
but
after
turning
down
last
year
in
rs
glad
to
have
tried
it
this
year
overall
i
paid
too
much
but
im
cool
with
that
o
overall
i
had
my
doubts
on
this
one
but
after
a
buddy
told
me
how
blown
away
he
was
by
it
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
and
glad
i
did
while
it
is
still
around
so
i
can
get
more
what
a
nice
surprise
this
new
trend
of
dark
sours
are
really
enjoyable
seems
to
be
pretty
polarizing
but
i
cant
really
understand
why
unless
a
lot
of
people
arent
into
sours
who
are
trying
this
if
you
like
sour
beer
youll
like
this
nicely
done
tart
of
darkness
pours
out
a
very
black
color
not
jet
black
but
black
enough
a
good
skim
of
tan
bubbles
forming
a
smooth
cap
up
top
some
sticking
on
the
glass
surprisingly
the
scent
is
pretty
straight
forward
some
roast
and
some
bugs
i
dont
pick
up
any
oak
or
the
such
just
lacto
and
the
guys
small
traces
of
cocco
and
tootsie
roll
with
warming
and
some
faint
malt
wow
this
is
a
sour
beer
i
thought
this
would
be
easy
yet
the
sour
is
pumped
up
i
get
a
lot
of
lactic
feeling
with
some
berry
blackberry
roast
malt
cocco
tootie
roll
etc
while
sour
its
not
an
integrated
sour
that
leads
to
a
satisfying
finish
i
get
battery
acid
on
the
tounge
with
tartness
small
relief
from
the
small
stout
base
body
is
a
step
up
from
light
eye
opening
while
i
appreciate
the
effort
and
base
style
used
in
this
i
just
could
not
drink
a
ton
of
it
this
is
quite
a
beer
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
tart
and
tasty
this
beer
was
awesome
handsdown
one
of
the
most
tart
brews
ive
ever
had
very
sour
and
very
enjoyable
refreshing
for
a
summer
day
i
was
scared
the
brew
would
be
similar
to
a
rotten
stout
but
its
not
even
close
tart
of
darkness
is
like
a
black
ale
minus
the
hops
highly
recommended
for
the
true
sour
fan
only
o
god
damn
is
this
beer
tart
and
appropriately
named
tart
as
a
mother
and
dark
chocolate
coffe
like
goodness
another
awesome
sour
from
the
bruery
o
its
tart
if
you
like
tart
acidic
i
have
yet
to
have
mother
funker
but
they
say
it
is
the
most
sour
beer
many
have
tried
and
if
it
is
more
so
than
this
it
will
be
just
crazy
surprisingly
tasty
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
glass
that
is
actually
transparent
in
small
quantities
little
carbonation
even
right
out
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
burnt
toast
the
coffee
in
the
nose
lends
it
the
smell
of
a
stout
also
present
in
the
nose
are
some
sour
cherries
a
suprisingly
complex
nose
the
taste
has
a
really
nice
and
mellow
sourness
that
makes
it
dangerously
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
is
light
so
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
an
interesting
beer
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
one
and
done
for
me
i
think
tart
of
darkness
pours
stout
black
with
about
two
fingers
of
light
mocha
foam
crowning
the
beer
head
retention
is
brief
and
theres
not
really
any
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
has
a
little
bit
of
roast
to
it
and
a
little
bit
of
earthy
funk
but
its
very
much
dominated
by
a
sharp
almost
fruity
tartness
the
flavor
profile
opens
with
some
contributions
from
the
base
stout
with
some
chocolate
and
lightly
roasty
notes
the
brett
and
bugs
did
their
work
well
on
this
beer
as
there
is
again
a
light
bit
of
funk
and
a
whole
lot
of
acidity
its
not
the
most
tart
beer
ive
had
from
the
bruery
but
its
damn
close
a
bit
of
oak
and
some
smooth
bourbon
come
in
for
the
finish
the
body
has
a
little
bit
more
heft
than
your
typical
wild
ale
but
less
than
youd
expect
for
a
stout
and
the
in
between
nature
of
it
does
a
good
job
of
supporting
the
malty
base
beer
while
allowing
plenty
of
room
for
the
wild
characteristics
the
carbonation
leans
a
little
bit
towards
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
i
got
six
bottles
of
tart
of
darkness
through
the
reserve
society
this
year
and
initially
planned
on
offering
a
couple
bottles
for
trade
or
to
friends
after
cracking
my
first
one
though
i
may
just
have
to
keep
them
all
for
myself
a
o
an
interesting
and
extremely
well
made
beer
worth
the
20
price
tag
once
yes
but
more
than
that
i
dont
know
d
i
have
never
liked
any
sour
stouts
i
tried
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
unique
o
good
yes
worth
the
hype
negative
o
a
very
good
and
very
unusual
beer
if
given
the
opportunity
to
try
it
you
should
take
advantage
o
this
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
my
favorite
beer
that
the
bruery
has
ever
made
including
melange
3
black
tuesday
oude
tart
sans
pagaie
and
fruet
im
beyond
ecstatic
that
its
finally
in
distribution
o
a
really
great
beer
one
of
the
best
sour
stouts
ive
had
its
also
super
drinkable
overall
tasty
and
unique
but
still
onenote
in
its
flavor
profile
coffee
and
cherry
sour
flavors
enjoyable
enough
for
me
to
have
purchased
another
when
this
entered
distribution
overall
usually
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
roasty
sour
beers
but
this
one
was
done
right
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
the
beer
really
rests
on
the
sour
tones
and
they
are
up
front
and
out
there
the
stout
is
a
very
minor
player
in
this
if
much
at
all
it
just
provides
a
thicker
body
on
the
ale
by
just
a
little
bit
the
sour
tones
though
really
take
the
cake
here
and
frankly
provide
a
bit
of
a
one
dimensional
ride
but
that
is
fine
with
me
as
it
is
a
nice
beer
i
can
suggest
this
one
note
revisiting
the
2014
version
i
find
the
beer
has
more
of
a
vinous
character
with
a
range
of
lactic
berry
flavors
joining
the
cherry
and
i
dont
find
as
much
of
the
chocolate
or
smoke
from
the
earlier
version
quite
a
good
beer
but
also
different
from
what
i
remember
overall
what
id
expect
from
a
dark
sour
some
smokiness
and
dark
fruit
nice
complexity
with
a
solid
feel
decent
but
really
not
my
favorite
style
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
with
some
roasted
malt
thrown
in
i
dont
get
much
tartness
or
sourness
in
the
aroma
but
that
all
changes
when
i
take
a
sip
there
is
a
nice
tart
dark
fruit
character
which
is
complimented
nicely
by
some
chocolate
and
heavily
roasted
malt
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
dark
sour
beer
the
tartness
and
sourness
are
nice
and
strong
and
balance
really
nicely
with
the
stout
base
mo
medium
to
light
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
sourness
fun
beer
to
drink
and
the
style
and
color
add
to
the
uniqueness
o
this
is
a
great
brew
i
dont
know
if
its
the
stout
base
that
makes
this
brew
unique
or
if
its
just
the
appearance
but
this
is
a
great
wild
ale
and
stands
out
among
the
style
some
head
on
the
pour
but
recedes
quickly
dark
dark
color
smooth
chocolate
and
cherry
and
very
sour
body
is
surprisingly
light
if
i
couldnt
see
the
beer
i
wouldnt
have
thought
it
was
a
dark
beer
at
all
pours
an
almost
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sour
grape
and
cherry
aromas
along
with
some
dark
malt
notes
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
very
grapelike
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
interesting
smells
and
flavors
this
is
quite
vinous
in
the
end
and
is
really
quite
tasty
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
as
much
as
i
have
and
i
certainly
wish
i
had
quite
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
than
i
do
though
i
am
going
to
quite
enjoy
the
two
other
bottles
that
i
have
of
this
assuming
i
can
keep
them
away
from
my
wife
who
has
really
taken
a
shine
to
this
beer
overall
the
stout
element
is
overbearing
i
assume
it
is
some
blend
of
oude
tart
and
something
else
a
wellbalanced
interesting
take
on
the
sour
category
one
of
the
more
complex
sours
i
have
had
for
some
time
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
fluffy
head
dark
fruit
roast
and
some
oak
notes
in
the
nose
light
mouthfeel
much
more
sour
than
i
would
have
anticipated
dark
fruit
tart
sour
flavors
gives
way
to
a
slight
roast
note
that
lingers
nice
lacing
overall
this
is
a
solid
dark
sour
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
sourness
and
roast
level
tart
of
darkness
takes
after
a
good
portion
of
black
ipas
currently
on
the
market
in
that
it
has
the
color
of
a
stout
or
porter
without
lending
much
of
the
corresponding
flavor
the
upside
is
that
the
sour
notes
are
mighty
tasty
and
its
abv
and
body
make
it
very
drinkable
another
good
sour
from
the
bruery
o
this
was
a
really
unique
and
tasty
beer
would
love
to
see
the
stout
base
ramped
up
a
little
bit
interesting
roast
with
sour
fruit
it
seems
that
the
sour
is
taking
over
though
a
great
beer
from
the
bruery
it
would
be
awesome
if
they
could
offer
this
more
often
d
fantastic
flavor
and
sourness
that
was
really
unexpected
for
the
appearance
went
down
easy
and
id
love
to
have
another
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
my
first
taste
of
a
soured
stout
if
this
is
representative
of
the
style
it
might
be
the
style
not
this
specific
beer
that
just
doesnt
agree
with
me
o
a
very
wellrounded
beer
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
wish
i
had
more
than
just
a
taste
but
will
hopefully
return
to
this
again
in
the
future
reminds
me
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
in
a
good
way
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
well
done
bruery
o
very
good
if
interesting
sour
i
love
how
the
roasted
notes
play
so
well
with
the
sour
notes
the
yeast
is
also
a
nice
addition
to
the
brew
as
well
as
the
slight
oak
notes
present
overall
i
finally
got
to
try
this
and
it
didnt
disappoint
recommended
o
if
you
had
told
me
this
was
a
stout
and
i
was
unable
to
see
i
would
question
your
sanity
does
this
make
it
a
bad
beer
no
they
could
work
towards
incorporating
more
roasted
notes
in
the
future
but
as
it
is
this
a
great
beer
o
this
is
much
better
than
i
expected
i
didnt
care
for
melange
no
1
so
i
felt
the
stout
sour
combination
was
going
to
be
an
instant
trainwreck
but
it
works
here
presumably
because
this
isnt
a
blend
but
rather
a
properly
inoculated
stout
i
feel
that
some
tweaks
could
bring
out
the
nuances
of
the
stout
base
more
but
its
excellent
for
a
first
attempt
at
this
style
the
beer
is
dark
walnut
brown
with
an
oily
tan
head
the
aroma
brings
funk
wild
yeast
cherries
it
smells
a
bit
like
russian
river
consecration
more
like
a
wild
ale
than
a
stout
light
and
easy
drinking
with
sufficient
tartness
sour
cherries
wild
yeast
oak
a
really
tasty
beer
assertive
acetic
quality
throughout
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
beer
is
thin
in
body
very
sour
very
acetic
interesting
i
dont
think
anyone
would
think
this
used
to
be
a
stout
at
all
very
good
quite
enjoyable
i
really
like
this
beer
im
not
sure
if
this
entire
batch
was
soured
or
if
it
were
blended
with
a
sour
beer
but
i
think
using
the
latter
approach
with
a
bit
less
sourness
would
be
outstanding
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
glimmers
of
ruby
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
finger
of
light
brown
foam
floats
atop
the
dark
hued
liquid
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
malt
and
sour
cherries
combine
in
a
pretty
incredible
nose
taste
opens
witha
blast
of
tart
cherry
acidity
wow
this
is
exquisitly
tart
initial
pucker
gives
way
to
a
complex
malt
profile
that
features
notes
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
vanilla
the
finish
is
tart
dry
and
acetic
a
prickly
level
of
carbonation
contributes
to
a
lighter
body
making
the
beer
extremely
drinkable
i
really
like
this
offering
from
the
bruery
tart
tasty
and
refreshing
hopefully
they
will
add
this
brew
to
their
regular
rotation
highly
recommended
a
pretty
excellent
effort
from
the
bruery
here
significantly
better
than
the
last
two
i
had
from
them
sour
in
the
rye
and
melange
1
which
were
both
undrinkable
the
only
other
similar
beer
that
comes
to
mind
immediately
is
jolly
pumpkins
dark
dawn
stout
which
when
on
is
better
but
recent
batches
of
which
have
been
disappointing
o
really
enjoyable
and
so
easy
to
drink
a
nice
5
beer
with
lots
going
on
which
is
so
nice
would
def
drink
this
one
again
o
surprisingly
great
beer
for
something
i
wasnt
initially
interested
in
great
taste
and
at
5
can
drink
it
for
a
while
this
is
a
simple
beer
a
great
beer
leave
it
at
that
o
an
interesting
beer
and
my
first
sour
stout
has
some
nice
barnyard
funk
accompanied
by
roasted
malt
and
dark
fruits
that
can
be
found
in
stouts
pours
a
really
dark
brown
with
faint
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
smallish
tan
head
recedes
rather
quickly
leaving
minimal
lace
smells
of
tart
cherries
raspberries
and
lemons
mostly
faint
hints
oak
vanilla
caramel
and
brown
sugar
but
this
one
is
all
about
the
tart
taste
is
heavy
on
the
lemons
up
front
a
bit
of
cherry
and
apricot
midway
through
then
a
slightly
chalky
taste
near
the
finish
bone
dry
sour
patch
kids
kind
of
finish
tart
and
chalky
mouthfeel
moderate
level
of
carbonation
medium
body
besides
the
color
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
was
a
stout
as
it
retains
almost
none
of
its
attributes
that
said
this
is
damn
fine
sour
beer
lots
of
tart
fruit
and
mouth
puckering
going
on
with
this
one
trying
to
review
this
to
style
without
slamming
it
mahogony
pour
with
a
short
lived
beige
head
into
a
tulip
glass
not
at
all
black
or
thick
looking
aroma
yields
no
stout
characteristics
but
plenty
of
woody
sourness
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
no
roastiness
no
coffee
chocolate
or
any
of
the
other
flavors
i
associate
with
stouts
much
more
in
line
with
a
sour
flanders
similar
to
a
la
folie
all
in
all
this
beer
is
quite
like
a
flanders
brown
or
red
ale
comparing
this
to
its
closest
counterpart
jolly
pumpkin
madrugada
obscura
this
falls
short
in
that
it
has
zero
stout
characters
all
of
that
being
said
it
is
a
glorious
light
bodied
sour
puckering
and
mouth
drying
and
quite
delicious
o
much
better
than
i
was
anticipatingprobably
the
first
sour
stout
ive
truly
enjoyed
do
without
a
doubt
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
carefully
crafted
sours
yet
experienced
from
the
bruerythis
has
the
feel
of
an
experiment
gone
very
right
while
the
flavors
are
metered
impressing
in
their
restraint
the
textural
qualities
carry
some
wow
factor
while
it
is
surprisingly
fullbodied
for
a
beer
of
very
ordinary
strength
not
to
mention
for
a
sour
things
go
awry
as
the
acidity
is
allowed
to
build
to
uncomfortable
levels
at
the
back
of
the
throat
misdemeanors
aside
this
beer
represents
an
interesting
collision
of
wood
and
sourness
in
an
approachable
package
advice
to
placentias
bruersinresidence
put
humulus
lager

then
do
the
same
to
this

thanks

most

poured
from

a
dark

black
color
with
a
good
brown
head
aromas
of
bourbon
red
wine
vinegar
dark
chocolate
and
roasted

on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
and
very
tartsour
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
bourbon
red
wine
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
very
good
easily
the
best
sour
stout
i
have
ever
had
d
other
than
the
meaty
note
in
the
aroma
this
is
quite
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
its
one
of
the
few
bruery
offerings
that
actually
belongs
in
a
750ml
bottle
would
like
to
try
this
again
and
see
how
the
sourness
develops
over
time
o
i
like
this
beer
decent
sour
ale
but
really
not
much
of
a
stout
would
definitely
have
this
again
d
good
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
hoping
for
a
stout
with
a
bit
of
tartness
what
i
got
was
the
exact
opposite
worth
a
shot
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
it
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
medium
tan
head
scent
is
tannic
sour
notes
with
vinegar
and
hints
of
chocolate
slight
oak
aromas
and
a
little
bit
of
funk
but
not
too
much
is
there
such
thing
as
too
much
funk
taste
starts
out
with
mouthpuckering
sour
flavors
cherries
not
nearly
as
much
coffee
or
chocolate
as
i
was
expecting
much
more
sour
than
i
was
expecting
which
is
always
a
good
thing
finishes
with
some
funky
cherryraspberry
flavors
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
puckering
finish
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
another
amazing
beer
from
the
bruery
its
just
so
hard
to
keep
up
with
these
guys
considering
all
the
fantastic
beer
theyre
putting
out
in
such
little
spans
of
time
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
beer
a
phenomenal
sour
stout
please
make
this
again
o
good
i
enjoyed
it
the
sour
notes
were
not
too
intense
which
for
me
i
like
and
the
stout
notes
still
come
through
though
are
mild
will
hold
onto
the
other
bottle
i
have
an
age
for
short
time
as
the
bottle
indicates
it
can
age
so
will
give
that
a
shot
with
this
one
o
it
was
tough
to
wrap
my
head
around
a
sour
stout
when
i
first
heard
of
them
and
now
that
ive
tried
one
i
get
it
its
still
more
of
a
sour
beer
but
it
definitely
has
the
stout
flavors
to
add
in
to
it
this
beer
just
as
clutch
and
other
sour
stouts
kind
of
stand
in
a
style
of
their
own
pours
very
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
looks
fine
the
nose
is
funky
cherry
fruit
oak
and
maybe
some
port
it
smells
decent
enough
i
get
almost
none
of
the
stout
other
than
the
slightest
touch
of
roastedchocolate
malts
this
beer
tastes
like
a
pretty
normal
sour
beer
if
you
closed
your
eyes
you
would
have
a
hard
time
telling
me
that
this
was
a
stout
that
was
soured
pretty
strong
flavors
of
tart
cherry
acidic
and
highly
carbonated
dry
and
light
in
body
just
pretend
it
is
a
runofthemill
sour
and
use
that
as
your
guide
as
to
whether
you
are
interested
i
have
to
say
we
all
had
the
same
consensus
on
this
beer
extremely
weird
but
it
totally
works
the
stout
elements
dont
overpower
nor
compete
with
the
funky
tart
nature
of
the
beer
instead
provide
a
nice
base
for
the
other
flavors
to
come
through
you
get
those
rich
roasted
qualities
in
the
back
end
and
you
certainly
must
like
sours
to
enjoy
this
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
a
nice
bit
of
light
tan
head
smells
pretty
tart
almost
like
a
sweet
tart
tastes
malty
and
crisp
the
tart
sourness
is
very
clean
very
highly
carbonated
crisp
tart
sourness
that
is
lightly
fruity
cherry
perhaps
pretty
enjoyable
d
very
unique
and
tasty
this
really
is
a
style
of
its
own
uniquely
sour
yet
still
carries
a
great
stout
profile
its
confusing
yet
absolutely
delightful
at
the
same
time
more
please
pours
a
brown
color
with
light
edges
head
is
minimal
you
can
stir
up
a
few
bubbles
but
nothing
really
to
see
here
smell
is
outstanding
loads
of
sour
fruit
like
pomegranate
lemon
bacteria
funk
a
hint
of
roast
peeks
its
head
out
but
if
you
close
your
eyes
you
would
think
this
is
a
blonde
sour
the
flavor
is
great
lots
of
acid
and
a
decent
body
again
the
only
reason
to
even
call
this
a
stout
is
the
color
and
malts
the
flavor
lends
itself
to
a
very
bright
sour
style
awesome
taste
mouthfeel
is
nice
up
front
but
the
finish
is
a
little
thin
and
leaves
some
harsh
acid
as
the
beer
warms
they
are
right
on
the
bottle
5660
degrees
and
this
beer
shines
room
temp
and
it
loses
a
lot
of
its
desireable
character
definitely
one
worth
trying
and
i
hope
to
score
some
more
for
the
basement
overall
awesome
stuff
really
interested
to
see
how
this
develops
due
to
the
low
abv
but
i
suspect
it
will
age
nicely
for
12
years
opaque
black
with
a
huge
tan
head
on
top
great
rings
of
lace
forming
all
around
it
huge
smell
of
tartness
perhaps
raspberries
or
just
straight
yeast
but
there
is
a
fruit
like
character
to
it
chocolate
and
caramel
vanilla
and
hints
of
wood
and
with
some
kinda
weird
dark
fruitiness
that
seems
to
accentuate
the
tart
flavor
flavor
was
huge
after
the
assault
of
chocolate
dipped
raspberries
and
cherry
a
ton
of
roasted
malts
lots
of
caramel
and
lactose
were
really
strong
on
this
very
sugary
and
full
a
slight
taste
of
cookie
dough
in
the
finish
o
a
nice
stout
sour
stout
is
pretty
rare
aside
from
madrugada
obscura
i
liked
this
effort
though
its
pretty
pricey
overall
not
bad
i
could
drink
this
but
it
isnt
one
ill
seek
out
its
a
bit
like
sour
in
the
rye
for
me
its
a
beer
that
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
going
crazy
over
o
bruery
nailed
the
head
on
what
it
takes
to
make
a
sour
stout
this
is
a
perfect
example
good
beer
teetering
on
great
complex
yet
easy
to
drink
i
am
getting
more
and
more
into
sours
in
a
year
i
might
think
it
is
a
great
beer
o
i
love
this
beer
its
very
different
and
i
hope
to
see
more
of
this
style
around
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
if
that
was
an
option
my
only
gripe
is
the
price
on
this
beer
skål
quite
enjoyable
definitely
recommended
for
sour
fans
o
i
like
it
a
sessionable
sour
o
good
well
made
beer
i
would
have
it
again
o
good
i
am
generally
not
into
sours
but
i
really
like
this
beer
overall
a
wonderful
beer
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
and
a
big
shout
out
to
mrmiles
for
giving
me
this
as
an
extra
and
am
very
happy
to
have
a
few
more
to
age
for
a
year
or
two
recommended
tastemouthfeel
very
sour
leaning
heavily
toward
clean
lactic
sourness
the
stout
base
is
still
surprisingly
prevalent
lending
some
nice
roasty
and
bready
notes
its
an
intriguing
mix
of
flavors
theres
a
touch
of
cherrylike
fruitiness
and
barrel
in
here
but
its
buried
beneath
the
lacto
and
roasted
malt
very
unique
stuff
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
overall
if
you
go
in
thinking
this
is
a
stout
you
will
be
let
down
because
this
is
essentually
a
sour
made
with
black
patent
or
chocolate
malt
or
roasted
barley
it
looks
like
a
stout
and
that
is
about
it
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sours
you
will
appreciate
this
beer
o
this
was
super
interesting
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
there
are
tastier
stouts
out
there
but
this
one
is
very
unique
and
complex
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
big
applause
to
the
bruery
for
such
a
bizarre
and
fascinating
beer
if
you
love
to
ponder
a
beer
and
defuse
it
look
forward
to
some
hours
spent
on
this
o
i
wasnt
ready
for
a
beer
like
this
but
i
also
assumed
it
was
possible
this
was
a
very
challenging
drink
in
terms
of
palate
exploration
first
off
you
have
very
strong
associations
with
specific
beer
styles
that
seem
to
converge
in
this
beer
on
one
end
you
have
a
flanders
oude
bruin
and
on
the
other
you
have
a
stout
in
this
beer
you
get
imperial
stout
flavors
in
a
flanders
oude
brown
sensory
experience
not
only
is
it
quite
literally
that
but
new
flavors
emerge
in
the
simultaneous
experience
of
both
styles
blueberries
emerge
between
tart
sweetness
and
coffee
roastiness
blackberries
creep
up
behind
the
drying
up
flavors
of
the
blueberries
this
is
new
and
exciting
for
me
such
discipline
in
maintaining
the
integrity
of
two
totally
different
styles
yet
deconstructing
them
in
a
way
that
it
becomes
possible
to
combine
them
i
applaud
this
effort
loudly
and
i
think
the
bruerys
craft
is
second
to
none
in
the
american
beer
movement
they
are
at
the
top
with
a
select
few
other
breweries
and
this
beer
is
yet
another
piece
of
compelling
evidence
in
the
assertion
of
that
fact
my
boy
nevins
came
through
with
this
bottle
we
both
agreed
if
you
close
your
eyes
youd
think
this
was
a
cantillon
some
sort
of
blend
between
a
stout
and
a
geuze
a
black
geuze
simply
amazing
not
alot
of
barnyard
funk
in
the
nose
as
this
is
pretty
young
still
but
tons
of
sour
how
did
they
do
it
id
say
a
bit
more
body
than
say
cantillon
geuze
and
a
very
faint
toffee
sweetness
is
hiding
way
in
the
corners
wish
i
had
more
of
this
bad
boy
for
the
beer
cellar
narrative
walter
chambers
wasnt
the
best
pharmacy
technician
he
wasnt
the
best
mortician
either
somehow
it
was
his
relentless
work
ethic
that
kept
him
powering
through
both
occupations
day
in
and
day
out
after
a
solid
3
hours
of
sleep
he
would
saunter
in
smelling
of
formaldehyde
dark
circles
under
his
eyes
yeah
carcar
problems
andso
did
we
get
that
abilify
shipment
come
in
his
dark
wrinkled
suit
had
strange
stringent
notes
that
wafted
through
the
cvs
pharmacy
walter
he
snapped
out
of
a
brief
nap
and
realized
that
he
could
see
his
breath
in
the
ice
cold
body
preparation
room
walter
i
told
you
to
prep
the
gauze
wrap
and
you
go
off
for
a
sno
walter
slipped
back
into
blackness
overall
im
impressed
by
this
one
didnt
think
much
of
it
at
first
glance
but
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
to
try
o
really
a
solid
beer
and
one
of
the
bruerys
better
sours
to
this
point
overall
even
though
i
do
detect
some
slight
roast
notes
personally
im
categorizing
this
as
a
wild
ale
a
very
unusual
damn
tasty
one
pretty
good
deal
to
at
15
for
a
750
wish
i
bought
more
this
is
my
favorite
new
beer
of
2011
so
far
all
together
a
very
tasty
beer
any
sour
craving
will
be
quenched
with
this
batch
2
i
must
say
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
only
slightly
heavier
than
a
standard
sour
it
is
a
complex
robust
addition
to
the
breed
opening
my
first
bottle
of
bruerys
tart
of
darkness
i
wasnt
sure
what
i
was
going
to
think
but
i
love
all
things
sour
and
all
things
bruery
so
i
had
to
load
up
this
is
amazing
it
pours
a
dark
deep
brown
with
a
finger
of
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
of
sourness
almost
vinegary
this
is
a
truly
sessionable
stout
not
huge
like
a
certain
other
bruery
stout
but
if
you
love
sours
you
would
be
able
to
drink
this
all
night
long
there
is
so
much
sourness
going
on
that
i
dont
get
much
else
there
is
some
malt
that
is
noticeable
but
this
is
largely
about
the
sour
this
is
an
amazing
beer
im
going
to
have
to
go
back
for
whatever
the
provisions
store
will
let
me
buy
drink
damn
this
was
so
different
but
so
tasty
so
glad
there
is
a
2nd
bottle
in
the
cellar
on
this
one
well
crafted
indeed
o
very
good
beer
not
the
best
that
i
have
had
but
definitely
worth
a
buy
adding
the
american
wild
ale
funk
in
with
the
traditional
stout
tastes
could
take
some
acquiring
to
but
i
personally
liked
the
meld
murky
yellowishbrown
pour
fizzy
white
head
funk
and
lacto
sour
in
the
aroma
sourdough
could
already
tell
it
was
gonna
be
an
acid
bomb
upon
tasting
way
too
acidic
and
sour
pretty
much
too
much
to
make
any
fruit
in
there
enjoyable
toasted
wheat
and
a
metallic
finish
medium
body
not
undrinkable
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
few
ounces
o
a
sours
sour
fruit
isnt
prevalent
but
its
there
gives
you
that
sour
face
o
tart
and
dry
apricots
a
bit
subtle
with
more
citrus
notes
o
im
really
liking
this
beer
the
acidity
can
be
a
bit
much
for
some
and
can
drown
out
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
it
just
really
delivers
to
me

poured
into
a
bba
snifter
glass
drank
over
15
minutes
not
as
crisp
and
bright
as
id
prefer
my
wild
ales
but
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
oone
of
their
better
sours
the
apricots
and
the
sour
flavors
go
well
together
o
sours
are
polarizing
people
either
love
them
or
hate
them
theyre
generally
not
on
the
fence
their
descriptors
can
seem
disgusting
in
the
case
of
filmishmish
barf
comes
to
mind
but
dammit
theyre
delicious
which
is
downright
hilarious
between
the
aroma
of
stuffing
your
face
into
a
bag
of
apricots
a
micheals
candle
and
potpourri
and
puke
ok
really
just
huge
acidity
this
beer
is
intense
and
unique
fruity
sour
and
enjoyable
filmishmish
is
another
example
of
the
bruery
doing
a
great
job
with
a
sour
at
this
point
the
jury
is
still
out
on
whether
itll
make
you
shit
up
a
storm
though
nice
beer
with
not
a
high
alcohol
content
apricots
make
it
sour
it
is
cloudy
and
thick
it
has
a
nice
head
tart
enough
but
not
a
very
sour
beer
a
bit
too
thick
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
ideal
for
sharing
and
tasting
this
could
have
been
a
berliner
but
it
is
too
thick
the
bruery
wilds
can
sometimes
push
too
sour
but
this
is
phenomenal
pours
pineapple
juice
color
with
decent
fizzing
head
smells
of
apricot
musk
and
sour
grape
taste
upfront
citrus
tart
but
not
over
puckering
feel
is
med
to
high
carb
and
a
bit
thin
but
great
complexity
and
drinkabity
highly
recommend
it
some
of
these
bruery
beers
that
we
never
really
get
to
see
out
here
in
colorado
are
just
wonderful
and
surely
it
is
beers
like
this
that
has
helped
build
their
reputation
as
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
an
awesome
fresh
apricot
nose
to
this
i
can
almost
smell
the
fuzz
the
texture
on
the
fruit
its
insane
hazy
blonde
in
color
with
a
peachy
tint
and
an
airy
white
head
that
relaxes
pretty
quickly
the
nose
is
the
best
feature
the
fruit
is
so
forward
so
ripe
and
delicate
the
essence
of
summer
really
just
so
impressive
lots
of
intense
carbonation
tickles
my
nose
as
i
keep
on
smelling
it
alive
as
heck
with
a
nice
sourness
to
it
not
nearly
as
intense
as
some
other
bruery
sours
this
is
certainly
tempered
by
wood
and
lots
of
it
but
the
sourness
comes
through
the
fruit
beautifully
the
flavor
is
just
a
little
less
dynamic
than
the
smell
where
the
sour
beer
overwhelms
the
fruit
just
a
bit
its
still
there
but
takes
on
more
of
a
jam
than
a
fresh
fruit
vibe
and
its
only
an
accent
to
the
oaky
blonde
sour
awesome
beer
and
close
to
the
level
of
the
best
apricot
beers
in
the
game
cascades
apricot
and
fou
foune
from
cantillon
this
is
not
quite
as
distinct
and
fruit
forward
but
the
interplay
of
fruit
and
sourness
is
as
good
as
it
gets
fantastic
beer
that
i
wish
we
could
get
regularly
in
colorado
a
crazy
tart
ale
nice
take
on
the
fou
foune
idea
works
well
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
acidic
and
to
a
lesser
extent
lacto
sourness
overwhelm
the
palate
and
overshadow
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
its
not
necessarily
that
the
beer
is
too
sour
for
my
self
im
not
sure
there
is
such
a
thing
but
the
other
aspects
arent
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
sour
notes
still
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
not
worth
seeking
out
either
im
still
waiting
for
the
apricot
tried
side
by
side
with
cascade
apricot
this
was
slightly
less
acidic
and
more
in
balance
the
tartness
blended
well
with
the
blonde
ale
and
was
much
smoother
than
the
cascade
however
if
youre
going
to
tell
me
there
are
apricots
then
i
want
to
taste
apricot
o
a
solid
peach
sour
that
has
a
good
balance
with
a
sharp
white
vinegar
tartness
and
a
light
peach
sweetness
the
peach
more
cuts
the
tartness
than
a
peach
sour
o
very
nice
beer
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
well
done
thanks
tenchi221
for
the
opportunity
this
is
an
excellent
very
well
balanced
apricot
sour
quite
tasty
and
very
drinkable
with
no
offsmells
or
flavors
it
may
not
be
highly
complex
but
it
is
definitely
a
glass
of
beery
apricot
deliciousness
aging
a
year
has
not
made
this
too
sour
but
i
will
enjoy
the
remaining
bottles
sooner
than
later
while
the
apricot
is
still
there
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
was
a
big
time
want
of
mine
glad
i
got
to
try
it
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
golden
hue
there
isnt
very
much
head
the
smell
is
light
and
fruity
i
am
getting
a
tart
note
along
with
a
slight
herbal
characteristic
the
taste
is
more
tart
than
the
smell
suggested
i
am
getting
some
apricots
along
with
a
lemon
juice
sourness
the
sour
note
has
a
touch
of
vinegar
to
it
as
well
this
is
a
really
nice
fruit
sour
d
good
wild
ale
the
apricot
flavor
is
nice
and
sharp
o
great
beer
worth
seeking
out
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
slightly
hazed
orange
color
with
a
white
head
that
comes
and
goes
within
the
blink
of
an
eye
there
is
no
lacing
on
this
beer
so
the
visual
is
kind
of
blah
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
tart
some
nice
fruity
sour
notes
fill
the
nose
the
taste
is
tart
some
acidic
apricot
flavors
in
there
with
a
very
subtle
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
slight
oily
texture
with
a
high
carbonation
as
well
overall
its
good
sour
i
would
have
liked
to
get
a
little
more
of
the
apricot
though
regardless
very
good
and
worth
trying
o
very
good
nice
sourness
with
a
decent
funk
and
complex
flavors
another
good
sour
from
the
bruery
this
one
isnt
out
of
control
sour
like
some
of
their
others
which
makes
it
nice
but
its
pretty
sour
o
recommendable
but
its
far
better
fresh
will
probably
rereview
when
its
released
again
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
with
no
head
the
nose
is
slightly
apricoty
with
a
lot
of
funk
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
definitely
a
dank
bruery
sourness
with
a
touch
of
apricot
in
the
finish
this
is
a
great
sour
thats
clearly
fruit
forward
and
drinkable
in
my
opinion
the
taste
compares
most
to
a
cascade
apricot
with
less
of
the
popping
and
dintinct
apricot
found
in
fou
foune
id
certainly
try
this
beer
again
in
the
future
and
im
curious
what
it
would
turn
into
with
a
bit
more
age
on
it
o
cant
go
wrong
with
the
sours
from
the
bruery
and
this
one
is
no
exception
definitely
glad
to
try
this
beer
overall
a
really
nice
beer
the
most
sour
beer
ive
had
yet
possibly
and
im
okay
with
that
great
stuff
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
sudsy
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
ring
and
wispy
haze
lovely
aromas
of
fresh
apricotlemon
juice
oak
and
a
touch
of

really

a
hint
of
straw
and
white

light
and

with
a

body
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nicely
dry
finish
great
beer
love
the
apricot
solid
bruery
addition
the
bruery
keeps
churning
out
these
slightly
aboveaverage
sours
and
i
say
keep
em
coming
the
apricot
presence
in
this
one
is
pretty
prominent
and
lends
a
nice
gueuze
quality
to
it
the
low
alcohol
also
really
helps
the
body
here
well
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
some
nice
apricot
notes
as
well
as
some
wheat
and
oak
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
some
very
tart
apricot
notes
as
well
as
some
white
oak
wheat
and
biscuit
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
m
light
leading
to
medium
i
could
drink
the
whole
thing
little
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
i
seriously
have
much
less
desire
to
chase
fou
fune
around
anymore
as
easy
as
this
and
cascade
apricot
are
now
to
get
whats
the
point
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
good
medium
amount
of
carbonation
dry
and
tart
finish
makes
this
quite
drinkable
if
a
little
puckering
o
good
sour
a
little
too
much
on
the
citrus
flavor
for
me
d
a
nice
solid
wild
ale
clean
and
crisp
and
with
great
fruits
this
is
a
good
sour
but
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
apricot
there
are
some
mild
notes
of
it
on
the
nose
and
some
light
fructose
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
its
pretty
mild
the
tartness
is
very
nice
though
and
there
is
some
good
funk
and
woody
notes
cheers
pours
a
hazy
deep
yellow
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
smells
of
lemony
funk
mostly
i
get
a
hint
of
oak
tannin
and
some
bready
sweet
malt
but
the
apricots
are
hard
to
find
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
lemony
and
tart
and
i
found
the
apricots
light
hit
of
funk
but
this
one
seems
to
be
more
about
the
acid
than
the
barnyard
faint
hint
of
oak
then
a
long
lingering
sourness
long
after
each
sip
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
acidic
mouthfeel
decent
wild
ale
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
low
for
the
style
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
really
liked
the
sour
tart
apricot
flavors
i
liked
the
sourness
and
the
low
acidicness
but
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
funkiness
to
give
it
some
more
complexity
overall
though
it
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
dark
yellow
coloured

very
pretty
funky

thanks
for
sharing
john
o
a
really
nice
sour
beer
apricot
is
understated
but
quite
tasty
extremely
drinkable
overall
if
you
like
powerfully
tart
beers
then
this
is
definitely
for
you
o
very
nice
not
fou
foune
but
still
very
enjoyable
and
more
evidence
that
apricot
should
be
used
in
sours
more
often
interesting
stuff
with
a
heavy
amount
of
funk
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
and
id
happily
drink
it
again
d
a
bit
singlenoted
its
plenty
accessible
for
an
intro
to
sours
but
theres
not
enough
variety
of
component
flavors
mixed
into
here
unfortunately
very
lowly
carbonated
but
orange
in
color
with
a
definite
haze
to
it
decently
funky
on
the
nose
lots
of
apricot
which
gives
a
touch
of
sweetness
a
bit
of
oak
and
maybe
some
grass
but
fairly
simple
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
pleasant
tartness
of
lemon
and
a
solid
apricot
flavor
as
well
a
hint
of
fruit
sweetness
with
a
moderate
oak
presence
again
a
touch
on
the
simple
side

definitely
enjoyed

with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
with
the
popularity
of
fou
foune
these
days
lots
of
people
are
looking
for
alternatives
while
this
one
is
good
it
is
not
of
the
caliber
fou
foune
is
so
dont
go
into
it
expecting
that
if
you
dont
you
will
be
quite
happy
with
what
you
find
as
this
is
a
really
nicely
well
balanced
brew
that
was
quite
refreshing
and
enjoyable
the
apricot
definitely
shined
through
on
this
one
and
made
its
presence
known
just
wish
there
was
some
funk
going
on
here
definitely
worth
trying
or
trading
for
if
you
have
not
had
it
and
call
yourself
a
sourhead
this
is
a
very
sour
beer
certainly
more
than
i
was
expecting
from
the
bruery
not
all
that
complex
but
a
nice
sour
o
a
very
refreshing
sour
especially
for
the
summer
months
very
enjoyable
beer
i
can
see
this
being
an
ok
substitute
for
fou
foune
o
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
i
freaking
love
it
the
apricots
play
so
so
well
with
the
blonde
parts
so
delicious
this
beer
im
appalled
i
only
have
one
bottle
left
medium
body
decent
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
with
an
invigorating
result
i
havent
had
the
opportunity
to
try
all
of
these
new
sours
from
the
bruery
but
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
the
integration
of
the
fruit
and
sourness
was
pretty
well
done
and
i
had
no
problem
drinking
a
couple
pours
d
if
you
like
highly
sour
and
unsubtle
beers
this
is
an
excellent
choice
thankfully
i
enjoy
both
although
my
stomach
may
dislike
me
for
it
tomorrow
a
bit
more
spritz
would
take
this
up
a
notch
may
eventually
get
too
sour
like
mother
funker
so
drink
up
still
i
had
no
problem
consuming
the
whole
750ml
bottle
over
the
course
of
an
evening
getting
a
little
annoyed
with
all
these
highabv
american
wilds
filmishmish
pours
a
light
bodied
very
cloudy
dull
tangerine
orange
in
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
at
all
and
appears
almost
flat
the
nose
is
fruity
and
tart
with
nice
acidity
it
smells
of
peaches
and
apricot
with
some
light
acetic
acid
the
flavors
are
pretty
straightforward
you
get
tart
peach
skins
and
dried
apricot
with
plenty
of
acidity
its
actually
not
too
far
off
from
hanssens
gueuze
just
with
less
acidity
ive
been
told
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
fantasia
but
i
think
that
this
has
better
flavor
and
much
more
fruit
presence
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
the
one
thing
that
hurts
it
it
is
the
watery
mouthfeel
this
bottle
isnt
too
far
from
being
still
it
isnt
too
far
from
a
few
gueuze
in
that
regard
still
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
didnt
exactly
live
up
to
expectations
o
the
apricot
and
sour
blend
is
a
match
made
in
heaven
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
hope
the
bruery
makes
more
like
it
i
noticed
a
number
of
these
reserve
society
beers
are
sour
blonde
ales
aged
in
various
oak
barrels
if
the
rest
are
as
good
as
this
the
society
was
money
very
well
spent
bottle
poured
a
light
golden
color
ale
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
apricot
and
light
tart
notes
is
refreshing
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
light
apricot
notes
with
a
mix
between
some
fruity
ester
with
some
tart
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
overall
though
i
felt
a
bit
letdown
by
some
of
the
characteristics
that
were
not
as
dominant
as
i
had
expected
the
oak
is
quiet
hard
to
distinguish
and
a
t
the
end
of
the
day
we
are
a
bit
far
from
something
like
foufoune
o
light
crisp
and
tart
the
apricots
were
nic
without
being
overly
sour
or
tart
o
while
i
found
this
beer
to
be
superdrinkable
after
half
the
bottle
i
was
a
bit
bored
that
said
split
even
two
ways
i
would
really
be
able
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
this
one
for
what
it
is
a
supereasydrinking
american
wild
ale
theres
not
much
special
about
filmishmish
but
thats
okay
not
every
bruery
sour
has
to
be
outrageous
this
ones
got
good
flavor
and
great
drinkability
perfect
for
drinking
alongside
dinner
3
5
d
this
is
no
fou
foune
but
it
isnt
bad
good
flavors
it
just
needs
a
bit
of
refinement
appearance
is
a
hazy
orange
with
a
small
ring
of
lace
no
head
the
nose
on
this
has
orange
apricot
and
certainly
some
funk
it
was
a
smell
that
made
me
smile
and
drew
me
in
for
a
sip
once
i
had
consumed
some
it
i
was
happy
to
see
the
taste
met
and
slightly
my
expectations
a
sourness
was
there
some
sweetness
with
the
fruit
character
some
barnyard
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
dry
aspect
to
the
body
leaves
your
tongue
with
some
tartness
all
things
considered
a
damn
good
wild
ale
it
was
nice
to
try
something
new
from
the
bruery
on
the
east
coast
overall
friggen
awesome
great
tart
fruits
and
sourness
extremely
sour
nice
fruit
and
light
bready
malts
so
delicious
keeping
me
going
back
for
sip
after
sip
o
i
like
the
simplicity
of
this
the
fruits
could
come
out
more
as
could
the
tartness
but
it
is
really
something
that
i
can
quite
easily
finish
a
bottle
of
on
my
own
good
blend
of
sourness
and
fruit
in
the
taste
tart
and
yeasty
apricot
comes
through
well
strong
acidity
which
is
slightly
polarizing
i
love
it
an
enjoyable
sour
though
i
certainly
prefer
mother
funker
to
this
one
overall
a
great
fruit
sour
i
loved
this
beer
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
bruery
has
ever
put
out
the
apricot
flavors
worked
so
well
with
the
other
citrus
qualities
and
the
oak
provided
just
enough
to
break
things
up
wonderfully
done
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
beer
year
round
thank
you
for
the
bottle
smarcoly
o
very
impressed
with
this
wild
probably
the
best
beer
i
had
during
this
tasting
great
flavor
profile
one
of
the
better
sours
i
have
had
from
the
bruery
its
business
as
usual
for
the
bruery
to
be
producing
good
sour
ales
keep
them
coming
filmishmish
pours
a
completely
opaque
tangerinelight
orange
there
arent
even
highlights
when
the
beer
is
backlit
theres
maybe
a
finger
of
frothy
white
foam
and
it
quickly
disappears
without
a
trace
the
aroma
features
some
fruity
brett
funk
thats
augmented
well
by
the
apricots
theres
also
a
definite
sour
element
to
the
nose
that
isnt
very
noticeable
at
the
first
whiff
but
starts
to
stand
out
a
little
more
upon
further
inspection
theres
a
little
bit
of
wheat
in
the
flavor
profile
and
the
funk
has
a
little
bit
of
an
earthy
edge
to
the
tropical
fruit
flavors
the
apricot
is
a
little
more
subdued
here
and
theres
still
a
tartness
to
the
beer
that
emerges
more
with
warming
the
body
is
nice
and
light
thought
it
could
maybe
stand
to
be
jut
a
little
bit
moreso
its
paired
with
a
nice
expressive
carbonation
though
filmishmish
is
a
solid
offering
from
the
bruery
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
sours
and
experimental
beers
this
year
the
contrast
of
fresh
fruit
verse
sweet
grain
and
bacterial
sourness
is
a
very
nice
balance
that
keeps
me
enjoying
this
from
start
to
finish
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
to
lower
level
of
carbonation
this
brew
nails
it
for
what
i
expect
in
a
fruited
wild
ale
the
apricots
are
there
with
a
fresh
natural
flavor
that
is
very
enjoyable
i
wanted
to
open
one
of
these
as
soon
as
possible
to
see
the
fruit
inclusion
before
any
of
it
fades
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
this
brew
develops
into
pours
cloudy
golden
with
no
head
aroma
is
solid
apricot
the
beer
is
an
intensely
fruity
sour
with
the
tart
apricots
enhancing
the
acidity
dry
mildly
astrigent
with
a
long
linger
my
favorite
of
the
tasting
so
far
pours
a
murky
apricot
gold
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sour
funky
and
earth
apricot
and
peach
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
solely
of
sour
and
funky
apricot
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
sour
that
is
quite
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
beer
is
a
straw
yellow
color
appearing
hazy
there
is
virtually
no
head
just
a
few
scattered
bubbles
the
scent
is
of
musty
apricots
yeast
and
a
mild
funk
presence
decent
enough
beer
apricot
presence
is
there
but
the
flavor
falls
short
of
greatness
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
low
but
otherwise
the
feel
is
pretty
good
mild
tartness
and
acidity
overall
good
but
not
great
still
its
always
nice
to
enjoy
an
apricot
sour
ale
very
solid
beer
the
apricot
is
a
good
touch
although
i
wish
it
stood
out
a
bit
more
the
sourness
is
pretty
intense
this
is
a
good
beer
now
but
i
dont
see
it
holding
up
too
well
with
time
once
the
apricot
fades
there
may
not
be
much
left
here
and
the
sourness
may
overpower
a
flavorful
attempt
but
not
near
the
top
tier
of
sours
andor
the
bruerys
beers
taste
mouthfeel
moderately
sour
up
front
big
on
the
lacto
though
it
thankfully
avoids
tasting
like
yogurt
the
fruit
and
funk
take
over
from
there
and
as
the
nose
implies
this
highlights
the
earthier
drier
aspects
of
the
fruit
rather
than
the
ripe
sweetness
found
in
some
of
the
better
batches
of
fou
foune
the
mouthfeel
is
good
moderately
effervescent
light
but
not
thin
and
the
finish
is
long
leaving
a
residual
note
of
apricot
skin
on
the
palate
that
i
enjoy
i
like
this
beer
on
the
whole
and
it
seems
almost
unfair
to
compare
it
to
fou
foune
but
ultimately
thats
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
when
i
think
apricot
sour
and
this
definitely
falls
short
nevertheless
its
decent
stuff
beer
is
thin
and
bubbles
on
hte
palate
tastes
fine
but
there
an
odd
finish
to
it
a
little
stingy
and
again
the
fruit
is
mild
this
isnt
the
fou
foune
replacement
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
decent
though
t
damn
this
was
top
notch
stuff
tons
of
sourness
right
off
the
bat
lots
of
mouth
puckering
lemon
and
vinegar
flavor
with
a
great
touch
of
apricot
jam
and
some
oak
on
the
finish
i
really
want
a
bottle
of
this
edit
bumped
the
appearance
from
a
3
5
to
a
4
0
and
the
overall
from
a
4
0
to
a
4
5
ive
had
this
one
3
times
now
and
have
liked
it
more
each
time
ive
had
it
havent
gotten
any
sediment
from
the
second
of
third
bottles
overall
i
think
this
a
very
good
fruity
wild
ale
not
overly
funky
or
sour
but
tasty
pours
a
hazy
light
apricot
color
with
a
very
thing
white
head
and
a
bit
of
a
white
collar
though
not
too
impressive
on
the
appearance
the
nose
brings
a
pretty
good
amount
of
apricot
with
some
lactic
sourness
and
a
good
bit
of
wheat
in
the
background
the
flavor
has
some
nice
lactic
sourness
and
a
semistrong
apricot
presence
light
body
with
a
good
dry
sour
finish
tart
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
wheat
presence
pours
a
very
hazy
bright
golden
color
with
a
hint
of
orange
small
white
head
that
turn
to
bubbles
very
quickly
scent
is
quite
delightful
the
apricots
make
themselves
known
immediately
nice
funk
and
oak
aromas
with
some
white
wine
vinegar
but
very
faint
a
little
musty
i
really
love
the
nose
on
this
lets
hope
the
flavors
are
just
as
nice
taste
is
immediately
acidic
tartness
which
turns
to
lactic
apricot
flavors
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
finishes
sweet
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
a
lingering
tartness
for
some
reason
i
was
under
the
impression
this
one
wasnt
going
to
be
very
sour
but
it
is
damn
sour
which
i
love
the
sour
notes
mesh
well
with
the
stone
fruit
flavors
and
slightly
acidic
notes
very
fruity
and
sour
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
almost
sparkling
like
champagne
very
puckering
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
i
love
this
beer
it
is
absolutely
delicious
and
sour
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
bottles
once
were
allowed
to
overall
this
was
a
tasty
beer
but
not
one
i
was
wowed
by
the
apricot
was
faint
if
present
at
all
and
the
lactic
acidity
is
a
bit
much
for
my
liking
nothing
wrong
with
this
per
say
just
not
something
i
overly
enjoyed
to
plan
to
have
again
anytime
soon
overall
a
tasty
sour
where
the
apricots
feature
but
dont
overpower
the
taste
profile
medium
bodied
crisp
lingering
tartness
its
got
some
residual
sweetness
maybe
well
get
more
brett
verdict
exceptional
sour
from
the
bruery
these
guys
have
a
knack
at
making
these
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
lots
of
funk
pungent
and
sour
nice
fruit
profile
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
a
job
well
done
overall
a
nice
apricot
sour
not
super
complex
but
the
fruit
profile
is
quite
good
recommended
o
this
could
give
fou
foune
a
run
for
its
money
seriously
its
that
good
quite
a
shocker
drink
this
was
really
fresh
and
vibrant
but
i
really
didnt
find
the
apricots
in
this
one
more
straight
funk
but
still
really
good
i
have
one
more
to
sit
on
for
the
recommended
year
on
the
bottle
we
will
see
what
happens
o
very
nice
wait
to
see
how
the
bottles
turn
out
worth
a
try
i
found
very
little
kumquat
aroma
or
flavor
very
of
dimensional
extremely
sour
wish
i
had
had
it
side
by
side
with
the
other
sour
in
the
rye
variations
but
as
far
as
i
can
remember
i
preferred
the
kumquat
version
added
a
lot
more
sour
with
some
tropical
resiny
citrus
character
very
nice
the
feel
of
this
beer
gives
you
the
same
reaction
as
eating
a
warhead
candy
its
great
overall
pretty
good
rye
gives
it
some
unique
characteristics
for
a
sour
and
the
citrus
is
a
nice
improvement
to
the
regular
sitr
worth
trying
for
sure
but
no
need
to
go
crazy
seeking
it
out
pours
a
dark
golden
haze
low
carb
beautiful
citrus
nose
thin
to
medium
bodied
perfect
balance
of
sour
and
citrusy
flavor
none
of
that
vinegar
either
i
can
crush
a
bomber
of
this
alone
overall
4
25
the
addition
of
the
tiny
citrus
fruit
does
marvels
for
this
beer
and
makes
it
quite
refreshing
and
a
bit
easier
to
drink
more
of
than
the
nonfruited
sitr
it
certainly
makes
me
curious
to
try
more
beers
that
utilize
kumquat
in
the
future
o
an
incredible
beer
great
flavors
and
complexity
thats
a
pleasure
to
drink
truly
an
amazing
beer

i
had
this
back
to
back
with
sour
in
the
rye
and
it
seemed
that
this
was
a
very
different
beer
age
and
a
batch
from
a
different
year
may
have
made
all
the
difference
but
it
has
a
more
pink
grapefruit
like
color
the
nose
was
sweet
sour
and
tart
citrus
fruit
but
there
was
more
of
a
minerally
acidic
aroma
the
flavor
was
more
earthy
minerally
and
orangier
than
sour
in
the
rye
it
felt
about
the
same
very
good
beer
but
i
liked
the
sour
a
bit
better
crisp
clean
and
utter
refreshing
the
thirststripping
sourness
leaves
the
palate
dry
and
only
moderately
earthy
as
subtleties
of
cork
cellarlike
must
weathered
oak
tobacco
and
damp
soil
emerge
in
aftertaste
great
beer
nice
fruit
and
sourness
would
love
to
try
sitr
peaches
i
continue
to
become
more
and
more
impressed
by
sours
this
is
yet
another
really
well
made
one
bottle
shared
at
the
swamp
head
bottle
drop
pours
slightly
murky
orange
colored
with
a
fluffy
white
to
off
white
head
on
top
beautiful
aroma
of
sour
vinegar
tropical
fruit
and
the
light
spice
i
get
from
the
regular
sitr
flavor
follows
with
light
sourness
that
is
sweetened
up
by
the
semisweet
and
tart
kumquats
clean
crisp
finish
with
a
lingering
fruity
flavor
left
on
the
palate
my
wife
not
being
a
fan
of
most
beers
actually
even
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
fruit
balances
the
sour
perfectly
here
and
creates
a
new
beer
that
retains
the
beautiful
sour
flare
that
i
love
in
the
regular
version
a
little
more
heft
than
the
regular
version
creamy
yet
crisp
sweet
and
tart
with
medium
plus
carbonation
i
would
have
this
one
again
and
again
interesting
use
of
the
kumquats
bravo
drink
i
think
this
one
is
the
best
of
the
3
in
terms
of
bottles
of
sitr
more
balanced
and
layered
than
the
other
two
and
cloyingly
sweet
or
overtly
acidic
and
a
drain
pour
of
the
last
14
bottle
as
the
peach
version
was
was
very
happy
i
got
to
tick
this
one
all
3
75s
a
very
tasty
beer
a
little
harsh
compared
with
belgian
sours
but
very
nice
the
beer
pours
a
dull
darker
amber
brown
topped
by
a
halo
of
tightly
knit
off
white
head
that
provides
minimal
lacing
and
fades
quickly
the
nose
is
potent
with
distinct
kumquat
upfront
spicy
super
citrusy
a
little
caramel
sweetness
slightly
sour
and
some
funk
the
taste
is
definitely
similar
to
sitr
less
sweet
more
mature
and
citrusy
but
has
a
lingering
citrus
thats
far
more
potent
than
the
regular
its
lightmedium
bodied
citrusy
sour
and
dry
acidic
slightly
undercarbonated
and
definitely
drinkable
tried
this
side
by
side
with
the
regular
definitely
dig
the
kumquat
citrus
addition
90100
hazy
golden
brown
nose
is
fragrant
and
pungent
like
an
orange
tree
orchard
starts
with
a
tart
pucker
opens
to
bitter
kumquat
rind
and
finishes
with
a
sweet
juiciness
not
that
far
from
a
glass
of
oj
the
fruit
is
really
forward
in
this
nice
to
have
a
beer
aged
on
kumquats
different
but
really
nice
highly
agree
with
the
review
about
6
entries
down
there
is
a
weird
metallic
aftertaste
to
this
beer
which
throws
it
off
even
more
poured
a
hazymurky
burnt
orange
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
sank
to
a
ringlet
aroma
of
kumquats
apricot
citrus
acetic
acid
and
lacto
with
some
yeasty
funk
lots
of
tartnesssourness
in
the
taste
citrus
mainly
acetic
more
of
the
yeasty
funk
that
was
noted
in
the
aroma
sour
toasted
grains
i
never
bothered
trying
the
original
version
of
the
beer
so
i
really
have
no
basis
of
comparison
between
the
two
medium
body
a
bit
rough
in
the
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
decent
o
great
slightly
underwhelmed
but
worth
trying
and
very
enjoyable
o
quite
sour
but
very
tasty
frankly
i
dont
have
any
idea
what
a
kumquat
tastes
like
so
i
dont
know
how
well
that
flavor
comes
through
in
this
beer
but
either
way
this
is
good
recommended
overall
much
better
than
original
recommended
overall
just
a
great
beer
so
approachable
but
also
a
bright
star
among
many
good
sours
very
accessible
for
a
nonbeer
drinker
without
a
doubt
a
must
try
even
if
you
dont
like
sours
its
that
good
much
has
been
said
about
whether
the
awa
style
is
a
poor
mans
lambic
but
this
beer
shows
that
theres
a
time
and
a
place
for
a
sweet
and
sour
beer
very
nicely
done
o
very
well
done
bruery
i
had
only
been
moderately
impressed
with
your
sour
offerings
before
but
this
beer
was
fantastic
and
hopefully
a
sign
of
things
to
come
one
of
the
better
american
wild
ales
ive
had
m
medium
body
dry
light
to
moderate
carbonation
o
its
amazing
how
much
fruit
flavor
comes
through
in
this
beer
both
on
the
nose
and
palate
a
nice
beer
overall
i
prefer
regular
sour
in
the
rye
to
this
it
has
more
sourness
and
less
of
that
weird
kumquat
character
id
probably
like
peaches
better
than
this
one
still
this
one
isnt
a
bad
one
to
get
if
you
enjoy
fruited
sours
but
be
forewarned
this
one
is
more
fruity
than
acidic
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
i
think
i
was
expecting
too
much
clearly
it
would
have
been
best
to
try
this
fresh
but
i
did
not
have
the
chance
still
enjoyed
this
very
much
pleasant
experience
o
drinks
very
well
great
unique
flavors
is
more
than
just
a
citrus
sour
well
integrated
and
smooth
oak
works
nicely
with
the
quats
one
of
the
best
bruery
sours
ive
had
overall
i
remember
liking
the
peach
sour
in
the
rye
better
this
is
a
very
very
good
beer
i
have
traded
for
a
bunch
of
this
after
having
it
for
the
first
time
the
kumquats
actually
pull
through
on
this
beer
and
makes
a
big
difference
from
the
regular
sour
in
the
rye
which
is
also
a
great
beer
however
the
regular
sour
in
the
rye
is
not
as
good
as
this
beer
perfect
amount
of
sour
and
fruit
you
do
still
get
some
of
the
wood
finish
as
well
which
is
a
must
for
me
and
a
sour
it
pours
deep
orangeamber
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
orange
tangerine
kumquat
citrus
rind
marmalade
fresh
orange
juice
some
acidity
and
barnyard
the
taste
is
crisp
sour
sherbet
big
sourness
kumquat
orange
tangerine
candy
tangy
decent
acidity
wood
and
pickled
onion
monster
munch
with
a
dry
tangy
finish
medium
body
and
fine
prickly
carbonation
crisp
and
sour
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
very
tart
yet
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
it
had
a
noticeable
difference
and
enjoyable
factor
from
the
base
dare
i
say
i
enjoyed
this
even
more
than
the
peach
version
sour
in
the
rye
remains
my
favorite
bruery
sour
and
this
fruited
version
is
just
fantastic
it
brings
the
kumquat
character
and
a
whole
lot
more
o
tart
and
citrusy
with
a
big
rye
finish
ositr
was
a
great
beer
already
adding
the
kumquats
gave
it
a
nice
citrus
finish
allowing
for
perfect
balance
an
amazing
beer
huge
thanks
for
offing
up
unused
allocations
super
tart
and
acidic
flavors
of
unripe
fruit
mainly
crabapple
and
grape
the
tiny
green
sour
variety
very
dry
and
puckering
gets
the
old
salivary
glands
working
into
overdrive
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
kumquat
but
guessing
it
adds
some
acidity
and
sugars
to
fuel
the
wild
yeasts
activity
of
beers
with
additions
this
really
does
the
beer
well
im
really
impressed
and
truly
do
like
it
more
than
the
original
that
exotic
tropical
kumquat
really
pushes
this
beer
to
another
level
its
funny
every
time
i
think
of
kumquats
my
mind
goes
back
to
that
skit
from
sesame
street
back
in
the
day
about
the
picky
girl
who
didnt
like
kumquats
mostly
because
shed
never
had
them
before
and
was
skeptical
of
new
things
until
shed
tried
them
how
odd
the
brain
works
sometimes
amiright
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
sunset
rubyamber
topped
by
a
short
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
apple
vinegar
cherryflavored
shocktarts
light
balsa
mild
toffee
light
sour
plum
and
a
wash
of
sour
citrus
juices
potentially
including
the
kumquat
but
i
have
no
earthly
idea
what
that
smells
or
tastes
like
so
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
plenty
of
vinegar
and
straight
sourness
mixing
with
the
fruit
and
an
undercurrent
of
toffeeimbued
sweetness
that
serves
mostly
to
buoy
and
support
the
sour
rather
than
combat
it
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
stickyish
finish
overall
a
damn
fine
bit
of
sour
and
brother
does
it
ever
bring
the
sour
still
its
not
overwhelming
but
rather
delicious
and
complex
not
unlike
cuvee
des
jacobins
rouge
with
a
sharper
acidity
and
highe3r
fruitiness
good
times
indeed
i
found
this
much
more
to
my
liking
that
the
base
sour
in
the
rye
the
sweet
citrus
notes
add
so
much
i
may
have
to
get
another
bottle
if
its
still
available
overall
i
have
no
clue
what
i
kumquat
is
but
it
really
work
nicely
in
a
sour
beer
i
would
be
very
receptive
to
more
wild
ales
brewed
with
kumquat
almost
reminds
me
of
upland
persimmon
fruit
lambic
yeah
true
story
d
this
is
a
very
approachable
sour
soft
delicious
sour
but
not
over
the
top
one
of
the
better
more
drinkable
sours
i
have
had
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
felt
like
this
was
a
better
version
of
sitr
as
it
was
that
with
less
vinegar
to
it
and
more
citrus
and
oranges
and
fruit
in
general
plenty
of
sourness
there
too
and
no
problem
taking
down
the
whole
bottle
big
fan
of
this
one
now
i
just
need
to
get
a
bottle
of
the
sitr
with
peaches
overall
this
is
another
solid
brew
from
the
bruery
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
the
sour
in
the
rye
w
peaches
is
certainly
the
best
variant
to
date
glad
to
be
a
member
of
the
hoarders
society
and
have
more
of
these
for
the
future
o
tart
but
not
puckering
tart
cant
specifically
pick
out
the
kumquat
was
actually
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
beer
is
phenomenal
oak
rye
are
spectacular
far
too
easy
to
drink
7
6
is
almost
shocking
its
nice
how
the
added
fruit
just
accents
the
brew
leaving
the
delicious
flavors
of
sour
in
the
rye
in
tact
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
too
special
fruit
is
great
but
overpowers
at
the
same
time
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
i
like
this
one
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
as
sour
as
u
thought
it
would
be
but
still
super
fruity
and
deficits
like
this
much
more
than
the
peach
version
m
certainly
medium
bodied
there
is
some
fullness
that
comes
from
the
oak
aging
rounds
the
mouthfeel
t
opens
with
a
drawling
sour
note
across
the
palate
faint
lacto
lemon
and
unripe
green
grape
hit
with
a
touch
of
underripe
tangerine
towards
the
finish
the
kumquats
dont
really
hit
the
taste
until
the
finish
and
they
leave
a
sour
and
slightly
bitter
citrus
flavor
less
like
kumquat
flesh
and
more
like
the
skin
and
oily
residue
of
the
fruit
itself
i
dont
think
the
bruery
could
have
picked
a
better
fruit
to
add
to
sour
in
the
rye
than
kumquats
fantastic
stuff
o
i
am
very
pleased
that
i
maxed
out
my
allocation
definitely
a
sour
ale
that
is
worth
seeking
out
whew
i
fell
in
love
with
this
one
right
from
the
first
whiff
taking
the
first
sip
only
made
me
fall
even
harder
ill
definitely
be
drinking
the
bottle
i
have
coming
to
me
and
i
might
even
venture
to
seek
out
a
few
more
twenty
bucks
a
bottle
aint
no
thang
this
beer
is
totally
worth
it
straight
liquid
kumquat
and
citrus
shock
tarts
dipped
in
a
vinous
vinegary
bath
take
it
to
the
dome
and
tell
me
you
dont
love
it
o
good
sour
with
lots
of
kumquat
presence
that
provides
a
tropical
fruit
presence
that
is
definitely
unique
in
a
wild
this
is
really
an
excellent
sour
beerone
of
the
best
i
have
had
from
the
bruery
it
is
very
drinkable
with
moderate
alcohol
level
and
the
taste
of
fresh
kumquats
is
just
amazing
for
a
bottled
beer
one
might
say
it
is
so
fresh
fruit
dominant
that
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
beer
i
dont
consider
that
a
problem
it
is
not
a
fruit
lambic
and
should
not
be
compared
to
one
id
suggest
you
drink
this
one
quite
fresh
to
retain
the
citrus
outburst
overall
the
kumquats
are
a
nice
addition
to
sour
in
the
rye
my
favorite
version
is
still
sour
in
the
rye
with
peaches
but
im
really
liking
this
beer
picking
up
my
allocations
was
perfect
timing
to
help
get
me
through
the
hot
days
of
summer
with
bottles
of
a
tasty
sour
hazy
orange
color
with
minimal
head
due
to
the
cask
pour
starts
out
with
a
nice
vanilla
aroma
tons
of
kumquat
and
a
very
citrusy
aroma
overall
a
decent
amount
of
wood
with
just
a
mild
rye
and
vinegar
note
a
touch
of
grass
along
with
the
wood
really
the
only
funk
restrained
acetic
qualities
and
a
nice
tartness
overall
plenty
of
kumquat
flavor
makes
this
really
enjoyable
superb
the
best
beer
of
the
day
overall
very
good
the
fruit
is
fantastic
pours
a
murky
orange
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
incredible
with
sour
funky
and
tart
fruits
especially
the
kumquats
and
tropical
fruits
taste
is
also
the
same
with
a
very
nice
kumquat
flavor
that
takes
prominence
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
wild
ale
all
around
but
it
smells
a
bit
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
looks
like
pink
liquid
bread
smell
is
that
classic
bruery
smell
taste
is
addicting
its
not
the
most
sour
most
cherrylike
or
best
interpretation
of
a
traditional
kriek
but
its
damn
good
nonetheless
o
a
pleasing
and
enjoyable
sour
where
the
sourness
cherries
and
sour
cherries
are
all
very
much
prevalent
and
are
all
very
excellent
o
a
clean
and
enjoyable
cherry
sour
great
funk
on
the
nose
that
reminds
me
of
the
belgians
but
sadly
this
didnt
carry
over
to
the
taste
as
well
as
the
greats
of
the
style
solid
allaround

a
fine
kriek
from
the
bruery
a
bright
tart
quality
carries
maraschino
cherries
throughout
the
palate
as
the
beer
dries
out
damn
if
this
is
not
a
traditional
lambic
kriek
incredibly
well
done
and
spot
on
for
the
style
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
and
highly
recommended
exactly
why
i
put
up
with
the
lows
of
the
bruery
because
the
highs
are
this
good
o
great
awa
not
as
subtle
and
nuanced
as
excellent
kriek
too
heavy
handed
in
the
tartness
still
delicious
and
a
treat
excluding
the
aroma
this
offering
hits
the
target
on
all
aspects
light
and
refreshing
with
tart
cherry
flavors
only
the
faint
sulfuric
aroma
prevents
this
from
being
a
topnotch
sour
overall
an
amazing
belgian
sour
lots
going
on
but
all
tied
together
by
extremely
sour
cherry
notes
would
definitely
buy
again
very
good
overall
another
very
sour
sour
from
the
bruery
nice
fruit
notes
and
belgian
characteristics
a
pleasant
drink
overall
pretty
good
stuff
the
tart
cherry
complements
and
smooths
out
the
sour
not
something
ill
hunt
for
more
of
but
nice
enough
that
ii
enjoyed
this
try
overall
a
lip
puckering
sour
i
dig
those
but
maybe
not
for
everyone
pours
almost
the
color
if
pink
grapefruit
juice
with
no
head
to
speak
of
smell
has
sour
cherry
oak
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
a
nice
mix
of
tart
and
bittersweet
but
not
overpowering
with
mostly
cherry
and
acidic
fruit
notes
owas
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
really
enjoyed
this
and
was
wellbalanced
and
nice
and
sour
cloudy
blonde
body
with
nice
white
head
in
the
glass
im
not
picking
up
much
from
the
nose
and
certainly
not
cherries
still
no
cherries
to
speak
of
in
this
one
its
mouth
scorchingly
tartsour
at
points
it
is
warhead
tart
and
other
times
it
is
just
sour
its
not
balanced
and
it
has
no
fruit
in
the
party
this
one
is
just
a
misfire
for
me
overall
another
good
beer
from
the
bruery
its
a
nice
homage
to
the
traditional
belgian
krieks
though
doesnt
reach
the
same
level
as
the
good
ones
given
the
its
a
brewery
only
release
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
doubt
ill
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
track
it
down
again
pours
a
cloudy
pink
with
almost
no
head
nose
is
super
tart
acidic
funk
with
some
fruit
notes
mouthfeel
is
basically
flat
but
held
up
by
the
sharp
sourness
taste
is
very
sour
some
oak
barrel
fruity
sweet
finish
is
sour
followed
by
nice
fruit
notes
of
cherry
passionfruit
grapefruit
very
sour
beer
i
enjoyed
it
m
medium
syrupy
with
surprisingly
weak
carbonation
im
not
sure
if
id
want
to
power
back
a
bottle
by
myself
but
it
worked
well
for
out
bottle
share
slightly
artificial
with
a
cherry
ludens
cough
drop
aftertaste
sharp
and
super
sour
up
front
with
biting
acidity
very
spritzy
and
dry
fully
attenuated
the
sharpness
is
a
little
much
and
more
sour
just
for
sour
sake
adding
little
dimension
to
the
beer
itself
this
was
nice
to
try
but
a
little
onedimensional
m
mild
carbonation
kind
of
smooth
but
the
vinegaryness
kind
of
hides
that
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
taste
actually
we
found
it
pretty
challenging
to
dissect
through
the
thick
blanket
of
sourness
that
cloaks
each
sip
of
this
guy
we
were
going
to
sit
on
it
for
a
bit
longer
but
a
friend
suggested
we
hit
it
now
as
its
tartness
would
only
enhance
so
we
decided
to
give
it
a
go
and
man
this
is
one
of
the
most
puckering
souring
wild
things
weve
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
sipping
after
taking
those
first
few
sips
to
get
a
handle
on
what
exactly
youre
dealing
with
here
it
starts
to
go
down
extremely
smoothly
while
retaining
punch
at
every
turn
like
many
within
the
style
it
is
brewer
with
fruit
and
while
the
cherry
is
certainly
present
if
we
were
told
this
was
brewed
with
raspberries
or
blackberries
or
the
likes
we
wouldnt
contest
it
that
said
it
is
wonderfully
executed
from
head
to
toe
and
has
that
bright
personality
that
only
the
bruery
can
conjure
othe
balance
was
a
tad
off
and
being
watery
fix
those
and
this
beer
would
be
amazing
would
highly
recommend
o
im
overall
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
i
think
this
ranks
up
there
with
sitr
as
the
best
sour
that
bruery
produces
its
mouthpuckering
sour
goodness
that
being
said
i
found
this
beer
slightly
too
onenote
and
slightly
too
sour
for
my
taste
buds
its
just
not
as
complex
as
some
of
my
favorite
sours
on
the
market
probably
because
of
the
massive
amount
of
sour
cherries
used
i
definitely
recommend
tasting
this
if
you
have
an
opportunity
but
i
wouldnt
trade
a
whale
for
it
or
anything
total
4350
o
this
was
pretty
good
it
lacks
some
of
the
depth
of
flavors
that
the
best
sour
beers
have
and
i
found
it
borderline
too
acidic
for
my
taste
but
overall
quite
enjoyable
o
a
very
well
done
sour
with
a
nice
fruit
addition
not
a
kriek
in
name
but
it
does
have
that
flavor
another
brilliant
beer
from
the
bruery
they
managed
to
really
harness
the
sheer
essence
of
cherry
in
this
kriekas
every
kriek
should
the
beer
is
just
sour
enough
to
be
refreshing
but
still
leaves
enough
room
on
your
palate
for
the
cherry
character
to
really
shine
id
recommend
this
any
sour
head
or
anyone
who
loves
cherries
this
is
a
poor
way
to
start
off
the
series
and
im
starting
to
lose
faith
in
this
brewery
not
really
the
worse
wild
ale
ive
had
but
ive
heard
these
guys
can
do
better
than
this
its
drinkable
but
many
factors
i
mentioned
above
do
not
make
this
wholly
memorable
not
a
bad
way
to
start
off
a
meal
but
could
use
some
serious
pruning
especially
if
the
bruery
is
supposed
to
be
composed
of
barrel
aging
geniuses
and
whatnot
when
blended
with
the
somewhat
lackluster
cpt
lawrence
barrel
reserve
raspberry
and
a
dash
of
rubaeus
it
actually
turned
out
pretty
good
these
sour
ales
sometimes
bring
an
unusual
color
uncommon
in
the
beer
world
and
sans
pagaie
does
that
with
its
grapefruit
red
body
not
much
head
stays
on
top
its
aroma
brings
to
mind
melon
cranberry
and
acidic
fruits
it
has
the
taste
of
sour
cranberry
and
adding
to
it
is
a
note
of
wood
acid
theres
additional
vagueness
of
tart
fruit
with
a
rustic
kiss
added
all
together
you
have
yourself
an
enjoyable
sour
ale
looks
like
cherry
7up
clear
no
carb
except
a
few
loose
bubbles
at
the
bottom
smells
primarily
of
oak
sour
cherries
some
raw
wood
a
little
tea
and
some
sour
character
tart
cherries
bing
with
a
little
pie
cherry
oak
slight
sweet
character
in
the
background
some
earthy
character
im
having
difficulty
articulating
fuck
this
is
good
thin
with
low
but
prickly
carb
and
a
dry
finish
im
sad
to
have
had
this
just
because
more
would
be
hard
to
get
it
was
real
fresh
in
terms
of
the
cherry
notes
back
around
nye
another
bottle
opened
courtesy
of
koufax21
at

fight
nice
and
dry
delivery
relatively
low
alcohol
makes
this
a
great
beer
for
summertime
wheels
turning
should
open
one
at
silvaweidman
pool
party
fight
this
summer
while
there
is
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
its
well
placed
with
this
beer
funkiness
to
a
minimum
which
i
tend
to
like
carbonation
is
light
which
is
fine
a
good
sour
kriek
that
is
refreshing
to
drink
on
a
warm
day
i
like
it
a
bit
too
much
to
handle
by
myself
i
feel
like
i
just
pounded
a
glass
of
vinegar
but
tasty
my
favorite
sour
from
the
bruery
is
sour
in
the
rye
until
i
had
this
fresh
i
have
had
many
the
bruery
fruit
forward
sours
and
i
waited
too
long
so
i
learned
my
lesson
i
had
this
one
right
away
loved
it
sour
blonde
with
cherries
delicious
i
am
so
happy
that
i
have
two
more
bottles
to
enjoy
keep
on
with
the
good
work
o
a
good
beer
that
needs
more
fruit
to
distinguish
itself
thanks
redliner8
d
great
wild
ale
good
sourness
and
tartness
with
good
overall
balance
o
i
like
it
much
better
than
when
i
had
it
fresh
flavors
meld
together
well
much
less
vinegary
than
i
remember
might
be
benefiting
from
some
age
high
b
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
short
lived
light
level
of
carbonation
visually
but
inside
the
mouth
it
is
a
bit
effervescent
and
uplifting
i
went
back
and
forth
between
thinking
this
was
just
ok
and
really
enjoying
it
the
last
couple
of
bruery
sours
i
drank
i
was
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
however
is
much
better
balanced
and
overall
enjoyable
i
am
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
to
revisit
sometime
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
again
one
of
my
favorite
wild
ales
from
the
bruery
to
date
i
hope
at
some
point
down
the
road
they
will
make
some
form
of
smaller
bottles
with
these
sours
and
imperial
old
ales
or
imperial
stouts
at

abv
served
in
a
bruery
tulip
nose
has
some
bright
cherry
and
shows
some
initial
acidity
flavor
is
quite
tart
with
cherry
and
light
skin
light
body
needs
more
carbonation
sad
to
say
this
is
another
disappointing
bruery
sour
after
some
others
particularly
dark
base
sours
have
shown
so
much
promise
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pinkish
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
sweet
tart
and
aromatic
the
nose
is
slightly
reminiscent
of
cherries
and
chlorine
but
there
is
so
much
sourness
going
on
that
its
just
not
distinct
the
taste
is
sour
with
a
great
amount
of
fruit
and
yeast
very
tart
sour
mouthfeel
that
has
a
lingering
fruitiness
very
tasty
beer
that
is
worth
trying
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
cherry
sour
murky
orange
pink
with
thin
foamy
white
head
and
spotty
streaky
lacing
smells
awesome
tart
and
fruity
tastes
funky
and
sweet
and
fruity
a
little
watery
tropical
fruit
watery
and
prickly
at
the
same
time
overall
nice
not
mind
blowing
but
really
good
verdict
a
decent
kriek
style
ale
from
the
bruery
but
im
still
not
sold
on
this
one
the
flavors
are
almost
there
but
still
come
off
too
artificial
and
sweet
and
the
syrupy
body
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
i
applaud
the
effort
and
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
but
its
by
no
means
one
of
the
better
sour
offerings
from
the
bruery
medium
body
well
carbonated
dry
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
fairly
straight
forward
yet
well
crafted
cherry
pie
sour

bruery
pours
a
hazy

with
a
dense
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
and
solid
ring
with
a
few
spots
of
bubbles
funky
cherry
and
cherry
pie
lemon

and
some
nice
funk
the
bruerys
funky
beers
are
becoming
more
and
more
recognizable
and
very
delicious
great
cherry
flavors
like
tart

cherries
with

the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
feeling
towards
the
lower
end
of
the
style
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
american
sours
ive
had
in
a
while
admittedly
im
a
huge
fan
of
cherries
in
anything
but
i
really
thought
the
fresh
fruity
tart
cherries
were
fantastic
in
it
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
best
cherry
infused
beers
ive
had
and
also
a
very
solid
american
wild
ale
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
and
probably
my
favorite
bruery
wild
ale
so
far
o
quite
refreshing
i
would
love
to
have
another
and
would
by
again
or
in
the
first
place
thanks
warnerry
for
sharing
o
nice
sour
610
sour
nice
tartness
balanced
with
slight
raspberries
and
lower
effervescence
makes
it
easier
to
drink
than
many
sours
do
this
respectable
sour
has
vestiges
of
russian
river
supplication
particularly
in
its
yeast
and
fruit
qualities
while
distinctly
sour
it
lacks
the
sharpness
of
that
other
beer
it
is
wellrounded
overall
with
late
lactic
tartness
and
lingering
fruit
combining
for
a
strong
finish
o
very
delicous
beer
simple
flavors
the
work
very
well
together
would
definitely
like
to
try
it
again
m
this
is
a
big
light
leading
to
medium
bodied
its
a
very
round
mouthfeel
d
another
solid
wild
ale
from
the
bruery
the
sourness
is
subtle
but
such
a
vibrant
combo
of
fruits
and
dry
oak
that
i
almost
did
not
miss
it
time
might
help
the
sourness
to
round
out
though
d
this
is
quite
nice
definitely
one
of
the
bruerys
best
sours
nice
mix
of
tropical
fruit
juice
lemon
tarts
and
cherry
pie
id
gladly
have
this
again
and
i
probably
could
drink
an
entire
bottle
of
this
one
on
my
own
overall
tons
of
cherry
here
i
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
not
overly
complex
but
rather
enjoyable
o
a
very
solid
wild
ale
definitely
a
fan
and
would
drink
again
a
really
oustandingly
done
awa
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
to
come
from
the
bruery
without
question
pretty
good
sour
straight
forward
yet
delicious
the
beer
is
pinkish
with
a
small
head
that
recedes
rapidly
leaving
sparse
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
pink
grapefruit
wild
yeast
pink
lemonade
smells
fruity
and
sweet
with
the
addition
of
wild
yeast
sweet
tart
citrus
with
a
splash
of
lemonade
alcohol
well
disguised
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
sticky
feel
on
the
palate
overall
this
was
solid
i
love
this
beer
o
one
of
the
better
american
wilds
on
the
market
huge
props
to
the
bruery
so
glad
i
have
two
more
bottles
of
it
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
between
this
and
filmishmish
i
have
to
say
theyve
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
overall
this
is
another
great
bruery
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
way
more
than
oude
tart
o
nice
drinkability
and
it
was
pretty
balanced
nothing
was
over
powering
but
that
being
said
it
wasnt
anything
spectacular
either
better
than
average
but
nothing
crazy
highly
drinkable
just
kept
wanting
to
drink
this
in
large
proportions
we
all
thought
this
was
better
than
oude
tart
thanks
egrace84
for
the
bruery
share
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
probably
one
of
the
better
bruery
sours
ive
had
while
it
is
pretty
sour
luckily
it
is
not
overly
sour
like
mother
funker
and
finds
a
nice
level
of
tart
cherries
and
sourness
the
nose
is
great
and
im
very
glad
to
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
one
curious
to
see
if
it
gets
funkier
over
time
like
filmishmish
has
become
m
light
body
moderate
carbonation
o
very
tart
with
a
nice
sweet
oaky
cherry
flavors
overall
quite
nice
barely
a
blonde
ale
anymore
more
american
sour
ale
with
nice
sour
cherry
juice
and
tart
fruit
with
that
slight
flash
of
oak
and
mouth
puckering
sourness
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
lived
up
to
what
i
wanted
not
quite
as
good
as
filmishmish
but
definitively
delicious
so
far
the
bruery
has
yet
to
disappoint
us
with
their
sour
offerings
beer
is
sharp
and
bright
on
the
palate
really
sour
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
strong
but
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
it
personally
it
took
a
while
to
finish
but
overall
i
did
enjoy
it
o
this
was
a
decent
sour
but
it
definitely
wasnt
anything
that
stood
out
compared
to
other
sours
such
as
cantillons
hf
etc
definitely
could
have
used
more
flavor
especially
with
the
cherries
carbonation
etc
easy
to
drink
interesting
to
try
would
recommend
trying
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
spend
20
or
go
out
of
my
way
obtaining
it
overall
nice
very
good
sour
one
of
the
better
bruery
sours
to
me
o
not
as
refined
as
filmishmish
but
still
pretty
enjoyable
sour
from
the
bruery
pours
sort
of
a
pinkish
red
color
with
a
pink
head
the
aroma
features
plenty
of
cherry
but
there
does
seem
to
be
a
mild
butter
aroma
at
first
a
little
bit
carbonic
sort
of
a
sodawater
note
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
wood
not
quite
as
tart
as
id
like
the
flavor
has
plenty
of
cherry
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
sort
of
cherry
pielike
some
oak
and
vanilla
are
present
on
the
palate
as
well
maybe
a
bit
of
grass
not
much
in
the
way
of
funk
somewhat
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
crisp
and
clean
with
a
puckering
dry
finish
refreshing
and
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
bruery
offerings
so
far
o
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
had
it
is
easy
drinking
and
balanced
yet
retains
the
tannic
qualities
fans
of
these
crave
great
creation
here
i
would
definitely
revisit
750
ml
poured
into
a
snifter
with
a
hazy
pinkish
orange
color
reminds
me
of
oh
just
a
little
vomit
giving
a
thin
white
head
that
falls
to
nothing
almost
immediately
without
any
type
of
linger
the
nose
is
sour
upfront
with
light
sour
cherries
lemony
zest
and
a
touch
of
something
sweet
in
the
back
the
taste
is
just
dominated
by
vinegar
and
an
acidic
presence
that
is
just
off
putting
the
beer
needs
more
cherries
and
something
else
for
balance
a
thin
layer
of
cherries
oak
and
lemon
work
against
too
much
bacteria
for
sure
lactobasillus
without
any
type
of
structure
now
that
ive
had
mother
funker
oui
oui
and
now
this
im
starting
to
gather
a
typical
vinegar
presence
from
the
bruery
wild
stuff
that
is
uninviting
and
narrow
there
is
a
minimal
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
very
dry
finish
overall
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
the
truth
is
is
thats
its
a
terrible
kriek
and
needs
to
go
on
home
a
sour
acidic
vinegar
light
cherried
mess
that
looks
like
chunkless
vomit
20
are
you
fucking
serious
id
rather
eat
a
bag
of
shit
bottle
opened
with
a
hiss
and
foamed
over
about
4
oz
of
beer
before
i
got
it
into
my
glass
pours
a
hazy
amber
orange
color
with
a
faint
pink
hue
and
a
huge
head
that
disappeared
almost
instantly
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
sour
cherries
with
enough
funk
and
sour
tartness
to
keep
me
interested
the
tartness
pricks
the
tongue
at
first
sip
and
never
lets
go
i
get
lots
of
lemon
and
tart
cherry
flavor
and
i
swear
im
getting
coconut
as
well
earthy
and
fruity
tart
describe
this
one
fairly
well
the
finish
is
quite
dry
with
a
long
lingering
tartness
on
the
palette
medium
to
thin
body
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
almost
salty
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
tart
light
beverage
to
drink
but
its
not
my
favorite
sans
pagaie
pours
more
of
a
deep
orange
than
a
true
red
with
a
good
bit
of
haze
to
it
a
couple
fingers
of
white
foam
crown
the
beer
showing
little
head
retention
and
no
lacing
the
nose
is
excellent
led
by
a
blend
of
earthy
funk
and
cherry
skins
a
solid
supporting
tart
aroma
rounds
out
the
picture
the
flavor
profile
has
far
more
acidity
than
i
expected
it
really
takes
over
the
beer
and
drowns
out
the
cherries
and
brett
theyre
both
still
there
though
definitely
the
former
more
than
the
latter
but
this
is
a
very
different
beer
than
the
nose
had
suggested
the
body
is
very
lightand
paired
with
an
expansive
active
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
champagneesque
sans
pagaie
is
a
bit
aggressive
for
a
beer
thats
just
out
of
the
gates
especially
compared
to
some
classic
belgian
krieks
its
definitely
not
without
its
charms
though
served
from
bottle
into
a
bruery
tulip
poured
a
rosy
pink
red
with
a
minimal
fizzy
white
head
that
subsided
to
none
fairly
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
cherry
wood
sweet
cherry
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
tart
cherry
sweet
cherry
sugar
funk
subtle
saltiness
and
subtle
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
cherries
on
this
one
were
one
of
the
most
intense
experiences
i
have
had
to
date
with
this
fruit
with
both
sweet
and
tart
going
on
at
the
same
time
the
funk
laid
a
nice
foundation
as
well
to
followup
everything
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
was
great
to
say
the
least
felt
like
little
scrubbing
bubbles
dancing
on
my
tongue
definitely
a
must
try
for
any
sour
fan
out
there
as
this
one
is
really
close
to
a
kriek
in
my
opinion
a
very
solid
wild
from
the
bruery
tart
and
clean
incredibly
drinkable
although
no
one
aspect
really
stands
out
as
elite
o
one
of
those
beers
thats
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
is
simple
and
clean
and
delicious
and
considerable
better
than
most
bruery
sours
in
my
opinion
also
kudos
for
making
an
american
wild
with
a
reasonable
abv
o
a
really
nice
beer
one
of
the
best
american
krieks
ive
had
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
like
very
tart
dry
krieks
o
really
solid
for
an
american
kriek
just
tasty
o
decent
beer
but
the
appearance
and
finish
really
take
hits
on
this
one
sans
pagaie
pours
a
lighter
bodied
grapefruit
juice
pinkish
red
in
color
with
good
carbonation
but
no
head
or
lacing
it
really
does
look
like
grapefruit
juice
or
strawberry
lemonade
the
nose
is
great
its
tart
and
fruity
with
a
fresh
cherry
juice
presence
i
dig
it
the
flavors
mimic
the
aromas
there
is
a
lot
of
sour
cherry
juice
with
nice
acidity
it
isnt
overly
complex
but
its
a
nice
sour
it
drinks
light
and
dry
im
a
fan
this
beer
isnt
too
far
away
from
a
kriek
in
flavor
just
lighter
with
more
tartness
and
is
a
tad
on
the
juicy
side
hut
its
worth
trying
i
enjoyed
it
for
a
young
brewery
to
produce
a
sour
at
this
level
reveals
great
potential
i
look
forward
to
sampling
sours
from
rue
co
in
a
decade
or
so
pours
a
reddishgrapefruit
like
color
that
is
almost
clear
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
instantly
scent
is
heavy
with
the
cherriesa
ton
of
funk
reached
my
nose
the
second
i
popped
off
the
cap
a
bit
of
citrus
on
top
of
the
cherriesim
picking
up
grapefruit
and
tangerines
just
a
touch
of
vinegar
taste
is
initially
delicious
tangerines
which
graceful
transforms
into
tart
cherries
finish
with
a
sweet
cherry
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
at
first
this
beer
seems
extremely
sour
but
as
you
take
more
sips
it
becomes
much
more
balanced
nice
cherry
sweetness
to
this
beer
a
bit
of
oak
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
otiose
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
very
fizzy
almost
sodalike
puckering
sour
leads
to
sticky
sweet
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
another
outstanding
sour
from
the
bruery
i
was
worried
the
cherries
would
not
be
as
noticeable
as
i
was
hoping
but
it
definitely
pulled
through
bravo
bruery
overall
not
really
that
impressive
i
was
impressed
with
the
apricot
version
and
was
hoping
this
would
be
its
equal
alas
it
is
not
overall
nice
light
fruity
sour
o
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
had
from
these
guys
impressive
and
tasty
drink
kudos
to
the
team
at
the
bruery
for
doing
this
every
month
they
got
me
into
sours
and
probably
will
keep
me
here
o
it
was
good
beer
all
around
and
was
def
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
good
sour
o
nice
attempt
but
came
up
a
little
short
has
potential
with
some
time
on
it
still
refreshing
and
clean
but
young
feeling
o
this
seems
like
more
of
a
sour
for
nonsourheads
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
and
mildly
tart
with
wonderful
flavors
you
may
be
let
down
if
you
are
looking
for
something
mouthpuckering
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
sour
among
the
bruerys
2012
releases
pours
a
slightly
hazy
redorange
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
of
sour
cherries
slight
vinegar
and
some
tart
and
funky
aromas
taste
is
of
sour
and
tart
cherries
funk
and
some
slight
vinegar
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
sour
with
some
very
nice
aromas
and
flavors
glorious
magenta
colored
sour
ale
with
subtle
blueberry
accents
world
class
fairly
sour
beer
blueberry
is
subtle
though
blends
nicely
nice
but
i
would
like
more
blueberry
o
this
beer
is
fantastic
its
extremely
tart
but
the
fruit
is
still
there
in
a
supporting
role
probably
better
fresh
but
still
amazing
after
some
age
truly
a
world
class
sour
and
im
not
just
saying
that
because
its
hard
to
get
blueberry
for
sure
2013
vintage
extremely
sour
even
after
a
year
beneath
the
tartness
is
a
small
but
noticeable
hint
of
blueberry
overall
pretty
similar
to
other
bruery
fruited
blonde
sours
nothing
mind
blowing
but
still
good
stuff
not
a
must
have
but
still
worth
trying
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
another
solid
sour
from
the
bruery
blueberry
lends
itself
well
to
theyre
particular
blend
of
bugs
and
whatnot
a
bit
unwieldy
thanks
to
an
off
balance
acetic
push
but
definitely
tasty
and
worth
drinking
again
and
again
while
this
may
not
be
the
best
fruit
sour
ive
had
it
may
just
be
the
best
blueberry
sour
i
have
ever
had
this
is
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
one
surprised
me
it
was
quite
delicious
and
easy
drinking
for
a
sour
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
o
while
i
can
imagine
the
presence
and
overall
fruitiness
the
blueberries
add
when
the
beer
is
fresh
beauregarde
is
still
a
delicious
and
intriguing
beer
even
after
a
year
its
got
plenty
of
sour
power
with
acidic
and
funky
yeast
but
bright
and
drinkable
regardless
i
have
not
had
a
ton
of
blueberry
sours
i
can
recall
evil
twin
cascade
and
a
handful
of
others
and
this
is
definitely
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
a
great
use
of
blueberries
and
a
rather
sour
lambic
type
brew
the
pour
is
gorgeous
deep
dark
pink
sort
of
purple
but
way
darker
than
raspberry
or
cherry
beers
obviously
from
the
skins
of
the
berries
good
inch
of
white
foam
too
it
smells
like
lacto
first
extremely
acidic
and
oaky
a
good
indication
that
the
base
beer
is
outstanding
which
it
is
similar
to
rueuze
really
maybe
less
complex
but
the
same
sourness
is
present
the
berries
dont
add
a
ton
to
the
smell
maybe
some
generic
fruitiness
but
its
hard
to
identify
them
specifically
the
taste
is
a
whole
different
story
the
blueberries
are
right
up
front
and
center
ripe
and
tart
just
a
little
sweet
blueberry
preserves
and
lemon
juice
carry
through
the
whole
flavor
the
finish
is
all
acid
i
can
taste
the
blonde
sour
through
the
fruit
its
a
similar
base
for
the
bruery
i
think
it
seems
familiar
to
me
but
the
blueberries
transform
it
they
say
to
drink
it
fresh
and
this
bottle
is
over
a
year
old
but
certainly
i
dont
think
the
fruit
has
fallen
off
much
its
really
buzzing
nice
carbonation
no
leftover
sugar
and
just
a
really
well
made
fruit
brew
from
the
bruery
who
seems
to
have
these
styles
on
lock
o
sour
fans
rejoice
beauregarde
is
the
real
deal
a
great
summer
sipper
on
the
veranda
oh
beauregarde
fetch
me
a
sour
o
the
bruery
has
been
making
outstanding
sours
for
awhile
and
this
is
one
of
their
best
yet
i
love
what
theyve
done
here
with
the
blueberry
profile
it
adds
a
sweetness
and
fleshiness
with
the
sour
notes
that
takes
this
to
the
next
level
this
is
a
world
class
wild
ale
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
else
the
bruery
has
in
store
going
forward
beauregarde
is
as
good
as
it
gets

pretty
quickly
and

glass
smells
tart
with
a
bit
of
blueberry
some
hay
and
a

cherry
taste

of
initial
sweetness

is

some
blueberry
and
a

flavor
the
finish

little
cherry
the
blueberry
lingers
for
a
bit
medium
body
medium
carbonation
pours
are
clear
dark
purple
with
white
head
that
has
a
pinkish
hue
nice
clarity
and
color
the
nose
features
a
great
balance
between
lactobacillus
tartness
and
blueberry
flesh
notes
of
oak
are
present
as
well
the
taste
is
super
tart
up
front
and
followed
by
nice
bright
blueberry
notes
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
sucking
on
a
warhead
candy
the
outside
is
tart
and
puckering
and
the
inside
is
like
candied
fruit
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
this
brew
is
hitting
it
on
all
marks
for
me
terrific
balance
huge
tartness
and
nice
fruit
presence
well
done
bruery
the
beer
pours
a
dull
maroon
raspberry
color
without
head
reminiscent
of
most
blueberry
sours
in
appearance
the
nose
is
a
distinct
blueberry
with
a
touch
of
vinegar
and
malt
the
taste
is
an
intense
washing
of
blueberries
on
the
palate
some
sweetness
following
and
a
lingering
tartness
its
mouthfeel
is
definitely
medium
bodied
slightly
undercarbonated
bone
dry
and
fruity
this
is
definitely
a
delicious
sour
comparable
to
many
blueberry
sours
bright
and
fruity
but
also
slap
in
the
face
sour
overall
a
very
drinkable
sour

in

its
brightly
magenta
small

the
head
dies
away
relatively
quickly
no
big
deal
regardless
but
particularly
not
for
a
sour
the
aroma
shows
off
the
sourness
right
away
lots
of
acetic
and
lactic
sourness
lemons
and
oak
the
blueberries
come
through
but
get
a
bit
muddled
and
could
definitely
be
brighter
and
fruitier
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
sooner
rather
than
later
probably
a
bit
late
with
this
bottle
already
some
vanilla
its
pleasant
enough
but
fairly
simple
and
a
touch
harsh
the
fruit
doesnt
show
up
as
juicy
as
id
like
and
theres
a
sort
of
bileish
note
to
it
more
than
anything
it
doesnt
have
the
funk
delicacy
of
better
sours
taste
is
similarly
a
bit
too
harsh
and
simple
the
acidity
is
strong
and
needs
to
be
dialed
back
so
other
flavors
can
shine
sour
blueberries
and
oak
finish
is
a
bit
gummy
as
the
acidity
passes
the
vanilla
shows
up
again
lots
of
pucker
a
bit
tough
to
drink
after
the
first
sixish
ounces
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
the
base
sour
just
isnt
quite
my
cup
of
tea
solid
and
enjoyable
but
its
conspicuously
another
product
of
the
bruerys
wellworn
oakedsour
template
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
its
just
becoming
a
bit
familiar
a
wonderful
beer
i
didnt
pull
a
ton
of
blueberries
but
it
still
was
an
excellent
beer
again
from
the
bruery
the
nose
is
almost
perfect
the
taste
is
very
amazing
and
sour
you
get
enough
funk
and
wood
flavors
coming
through
but
again
not
to
sour
where
it
is
unapproachable
the
mouthfeel
is
there
but
again
if
it
isnt
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
does
nothing
for
me
overall
one
of
the
best
bruery
sours
ive
had
in
a
long
time
o
a
little
one
notey
with
almost
no
complexity
evident
on
the
palate
and
no
evident
oak
influence
it
needs
a
little
funk
or
oak
or
other
fruit
flavors
to
balance
whats
there
pours
a
light
purple
with
pinkish
edges
held
up
to
the
light
little
carbonation
and
barely
any
lacing
smell
is
acidic
and
vinegar
with
very
mild
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
taste
the
sourness
and
tartness
of
the
beer
are
overwhelming
for
the
blueberry
flavors
blueberry
takes
a
back
seat
but
really
comes
in
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
dry
with
lightmed
body
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
out
of
this
offering
o
this
was
very
good
but
quite
acidic
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
it
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
glass
in
one
sitting
but
im
looking
forward
to
the
couple
of
other
bottles
ive
got
in
the
cellar
not
a
sour
for
a
beginner
but
very
recommended
a
solid
sour
with
a
unique
fruity
thing
going
on
different
from
a
lot
of
sours
with
the
blueberry
element
the
palate
opens
with
a
wonderful
berry
flavor
and
sourness
the
brightness
and
sweetness
of
the
berries
is
wonderful
with
the
moderately
lactic
and
rather
yogurty
sourness
closer
to
buttermilk
actually
the
lemony
sour
notes
also
appear
early
up
the
midpalate
has
a
moderate
sweetness
surprising
given
the
sourness
that
has
flavors
of
jammy
berries
a
little
honey
and
simple
syrup
a
touch
of
spice
cinnamon
is
also
present
the
finish
is
a
classic
american
sour
beer
finish
with
a
dextrinous
sweetness
pronounced
lactic
sourness
a
moderately
jammy
fruity
character
and
a
little
vanilla
this
is
a
combination
that
is
especially
hard
to
do
well
and
is
done
wonderfully
here
there
is
a
touch
of
dry
white
wine
vinegar
especially
in
the
backend
tannin
character
is
moderate
with
a
blend
of
skin
and
oak
tannins
complementing
the
lactic
sourness
wonderful
stuff
do
not
age
this
anymore
its
wonderful
as
is
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
interesting
and
enjoyable
surprisingly
i
served
this
one
a
little
too
cold
and
while
allowing
it
to
warm
up
it
really
didnt
evolve
much
i
enjoyed
the
subtle
fruity
touch
and
was
impressed
it
did
mot
display
any
phenolics
or
mild
plastic
suggestions
that
are
sometimes
associated
with
blueberry
usage
oa
wonderful
sour
from
the
bruery
one
of
the
more
sour
sours
out
there
o
this
is
a
solid
offering
like
most
of
the
bruerys
sour
beers
this
one
lacks
depth
but
the
powerful
acidity
keeps
it
enjoyable
nothing
is
over
done
with
this
brew
just
smooth
and
even
highly
recommended
for
a
fantastic
tart
sour
good
beer
the
blueberries
for
me
were
most
noticeable
on
the
finish
and
were
very
pure
in
flavor
and
added
a
nice
bit
of
complexity
to
this
sour
ale
the
beer
reminded
me
of
oude
tarte
in
terms
of
acidity
and
mouthfeel
but
with
a
bit
more
lift
and
freshness
good
beer
glad
i
have
another
bottle
nice
top
level
sour
o
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
for
loads
of
sour
blueberries
and
some
light
funk
throughout
glad
i
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
one
if
you
like
the
bruerys
other
sour
offering
and
like
blueberries
than
youll
really
like
this
one
wow
what
a
prettylookin
beer
pinkish
purplered
with
a
very
lightpink
head
scent
is
packed
with
funk
from
the
moment
i
opened
the
cap
tart
funky
barnyard
with
some
sour
fruit
skin
blueberries
and
plums
some
raspberries
as
well
a
strange
nailpolish
remover
aroma
which
is
slightly
offputting
but
just
a
tiny
bit
taste
is
sweet
blueberries
up
front
followed
by
sour
raspberries
and
tart
blueberry
skin
super
ripe
blueberries
with
other
tart
berries
very
berryforward
with
a
nice
lactic
sourness
some
nice
funk
in
the
flavor
just
as
the
nose
hinted
puckering
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
crisp
and
lipsmacking
tart
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
a
fantastic
sour
beer
i
definitely
picked
up
on
the
blueberries
which
is
very
hard
to
accomplish
in
sours
very
enjoyable
and
glad
i
have
five
more
bottles
overall
awesome
the
beer
is
purple
ish
blue
with
a
foamy
pink
head
violent
hissing
as
the
head
fizzles
away
to
nil
the
aroma
brings
wild
yeast
funk
blueberries
puckering
with
a
bit
of
an
acetic
bite
in
the
finish
nice
blueberry
presence
though
i
could
always
use
more
blueberries
agressive
in
terms
of
sourness
and
tartness
overall
another
solid
offering
from
the
bruery
the
bruery
continues
to
keep
me
digging
further
into
the
realm
of
sours
not
what
id
typically
pick
up
but
an
interesting
change
from
my
typical
stounts
n
hops
i
may
not
buy
another
bottle
but
id
drink
it
again
without
a
problem
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
wonder
how
this
will
hold
up
to
age
o
nice
refreshing
drink
not
really
complex
but
good
drink
on
a
hot
day
overall
should
be
what
a
blueberry
sour
is
with
the
only
complaint
being
smell
definitely
would
drink
again
m
light
leading
to
medium
more
carbonation
would
make
it
feel
more
t
right
away
theres
a
pretty
good
hit
of
lemontart
raspberry
sourness
with
a
little
dose
of
funk
behind
it
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
here
but
towards
the
finish
i
get
some
tart
blueberry
and
cream
notes
touch
of
lemon
and
lactic
sourness
on
a
dry
finish
carbonation
in
here
is
perfect
and
really
works
with
the
sourness
o
dont
get
much
blueberry
as
it
reminds
me
of
a
raspberry
beer
crossed
with
the
buttery
bruery
presence
to
it
decent
but
not
that
great
total
4550
o
overly
sour
and
one
dimensional
i
needed
a
little
more
blueberry
on
this
one
m
fizzy
bubble
and
highly
carbonated
good
but
maybe
slightly
too
much
overall
this
is
a
good
sour
from
the
bruery
they
could
back
down
on
the
sourness
a
little
bit
there
is
a
hint
of
blueberries
but
not
too
strong
overall
a
good
bruery
sour
o
definitely
impressed
im
a
little
let
down
by
the
amount
of
blueberry
taste
but
it
is
still
a
great
sour
none
the
less
im
very
glad
that
i
maxed
my
allocations
out
on
this
one
carbonation
is
nicely
done
with
a
zesty
and
sour
ending
all
though
the
blueberry
smell
is
subtle
the
drinking
of
this
alchemy
is
were
this
beer
shines
reminds
me
of
sans
pagaie
with
a
twist
personally
this
is
a
much
better
crafted
brew
pours
a
murky
light
red
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sour
tart
and
funky
with
fruity
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
lots
of
berry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
super
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
enjoyed
at
hunahpus
day
2015
in
tampa
at
cigar
city
brewing
ebf
sample
pours
a
turbid
light
brown
color
aroma
is
both
sweet
and
tart
reminds
me
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
cherries
are
tart
and
also
sweet
smelling
there
is
also
a
good
dose
of
funk
and
other
fruits
a
bit
oaky
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
some
dark
fruits
and
caramel
and
cola
also
there
is
a
good
dose
of
tart
cherry
quite
complex
finishes
with
some
oak
has
some
heftiness
to
the
body
but
im
shocked
that
its
11
ive
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
rather
interesting
2
ounces
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
not
extreme
like
some
theres
an
element
of
darker
malts
i
detect
no
bitterness
a
mild
sour
overall
excellent
brew
still
on
draft
at
monks
in
philly
a
couple
of
days
after
their
lost
abbey
dinner
awesome
sour
so
glad
i
tried
some
not
sure
how
people
get
this
quad
confused
what
other
master
brewer
can
cherry
out
a
quad
like
this
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
there
is
a
combination
of
sour
and
aged
old
ale
quad
ive
never
come
across
before
an
excellent
flanders
brown
poured
a
dark
brown
srm
37
out
of
the
tap
minimal
head
medium
tart
but
balanced
with
the
sweetness
of
the
roasted
malt
it
is
not
too
acetic
and
puckery
abv
listed
at
11
percent
but
there
is
absolutely
no
alcohol
burn
huge
beer
that
manages
to
hide
its
alcohol
in
tartness
and
malt
and
notes
of
sour
cherry
and
vanilla
great
take
on
the
flanders
brown
a
little
tart
for
my
taste
but
a
high
quality
beer
sour
cherry
dominates
i
get
some
barnyard
some
oak
and
then
some
warmth
in
my
tummy
solid
on
tap
at
the
aptos
st
bbq
been
quite
a
while
since
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
well
crafted
beer
the
wine
barrel
aging
really
dominates
the
flavor
profile
at
least
thats
what
i
detect
though
the
recipe
doesnt
list
any
wine
barrel
aging
giving
the
beer
a
lightly
sour
wine
infused
finish
you
still
pick
up
some
light
chocolate
and
malty
sweetness
from
the
underlying
base
beer
and
the
overall
combination
of
flavors
is
quite
aptos
st
was
doing
small
5
ounce
pours
of
this
beer
which
i
found
was
just
right
for
me
would
have
had
difficulty
sipping
a
pint
or
even
a
12
ounce
tulip
of
this
beer
overall
another
solid
effort
from
the
folks
at
lost
abbey
poured
from
a
12
7
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
this
one
didnt
seem
to
suffer
at
all
for
its
age
and
maybe
im
just
getting
used
to
sours
but
im
going
to
finish
this
one
off
and
wish
for
more
tastes
like
a
sour
old
ale
nice
sour
cherry
nose
and
you
certainly
get
the
sour
cherry
flavor
this
beer
could
use
some
sort
of
carb
there
is
none
its
a
little
pricey
for
what
it
is
expected
something
more
complex
or
complete
its
a
solid
sour
if
youre
a
big
sour
cherry
fan
the
flavor
is
lovely
with
a
mld
vanilla
mixed
with
sour
cherry
and
bourbon
juxtoposition
just
tantalizing
along
with
gentle
tangy
yeast
with
the
sour
elements
blending
well
with
the
mild
alcohol
and
wood
from
the
bourbon
with
cherry
skin
tannin
in
the
finish
and
warmth
of
the
bourbon
continuing
in
the
back
with
slight
dark
sugar
accent
the
tangy
sour
is
in
harmony
with
the
carmelized
malt
flavor
with
light
sour
flavor
of
fruit
and
mellow
fruity
sweetness
combining
to
finish
tart
with
a
drying
alcohol
taste
and
barrel
tannin
in
the
end
overall
this
is
a
true
joy
to
savor
for
a
strong
11
ale
to
have
a
quad
base
and
the
cherry
and
sour
elements
all
working
in
unision
is
a
testament
with
exceptional
drinkability
with
the
bourbon
enhancing
the
overall
enjoymentgreat
mix
of
fruit
and
barrel
aging
in
this
jd
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
but
no
overwhelmed
by
this
pricey
brew
was
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
the
overall
cost
would
make
me
think
twice
about
consuming
another
still
a
good
beer
and
session
though
on
draft
at
monks
this
latest
batch
is
my
favorite
wonderful
fresh
bright
sour
cherries
overall
another
really
good
one
from
lost
abbey
i
cant
speak
for
the
bottled
version
but
on
tap
this
was
excellent
really
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
o
the
sourness
can
almost
hide
the
alcohol
content
but
the
telltale
sticky
sweetness
on
the
endtaste
conveys
all
the
booziness
of
a
good
brandy
would
love
to
drink
again
o
alcohol
is
somewhat
apparent
in
the
nose
and
flavor
as
well
but
this
is
to
be
expected
with
a
beer
this
strong
and
its
quite
well
masked
i
would
recommend
this
beer
it
is
my
favorite
sour
id
say
have
a
few
other
sours
first
get
accustomed
to
it
and
then
try
this
beer
its
really
good
id
be
willing
to
give
this
beer
a
second
try
if
it
was
given
to
me
but
i
cant
see
myself
paying
for
this
again
a
mix
of
many
different
worlds
but
they
come
together
to
remind
me
of
something
between
an
oud
bruin
and
a
kriek
aged
in
a
bourbon
barrel
pretty
unique
and
a
must
try
for
sour
and
barreled
beer
fans
o
very
nice
flavor
and
im
enjoying
the
tart
cherry
notes
although
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
without
carbonation
it
tastes
flat
i
appreciate
it
as
a
quality
craft
beer
but
its
not
my
thing
o
great
integration
on
a
really
complex
base
really
nice
sour
character
well
balanced
and
not
overly
acidic
overall
interesting
the
tart
cherry
is
intense
and
the
overall
flavor
profile
hits
hard
its
drinkable
if
you
like
that
kind
of
thing
though
o
different
confusing
awesome
its
very
complex
and
you
get
all
the
advertised
flavors
and
nuances
i
want
to
try
this
with
a
few
years
on
it
great
flavor
on
this
but
still
falls
a
little
short
with
the
carbonation
issues
o
a
great
sour
from
a
great
brewery
need
i
say
more
this
is
a
perfect
lemon
square
limoncello
dessert
in
a
glass
even
if
the
dull
brown
would
suggest
otherwise
medium
body
with
little
to
no
carbonation
a
little
syrupy
on
the
tongue
before
a
drying
finish
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
a
bit
disappointing
poures
into
delerium
tulip
looks
dark
and
slightly
murky
with
tones
of
brown
black
and
carmel
not
to
sticky
on
the
glass
light
and
definately
sour
taste
is
cherry
and
chocolate
rounded
out
by
a
good
malt
presence
very
light
mouthfeel
for
a
quad
based
beer
this
beer
puckers
the
toungue
with
fruity
flavors
such
as
cherry
and
citrus
with
the
hops
displyed
on
the
finish
airee
and
dry
carbonation
is
medium
which
i
like
to
go
with
this
dry
beer
this
is
a
great
11
barrel
aged
beer
some
sours
just
dont
pack
the
abv
and
i
cant
drink
more
than
22oz
of
sourbeer
sour
and
a
very
slight
bourbon
after
taste
the
one
thing
it
needs
more
of
is
carbination
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any

happened
here
last

i
got
a
bottle
of
this
a
750ml
this
was
sublime
tart
and
sharp
and
perfect
this
is
an
unmitigated
disaster
and
i
have
one
more
with
any
luck
but
the
flavor
is
superior
drinkability
is

such
a

this
was
very
tasty
and
perfectly
sour
enough
to
be
drinkable
as
opposed
to
a
sipper
it
smells
and
tastes
great
but
the
lack
of
body
really
holds
this
one
back
it
drinks
way
more
like
wine
than
beer
due
to
the
abv
and
certainly
not
at
the
price
this
one
goes
for
if
you
like
old
vinegar
wine
or
stale
cider
you
may
enjoy
this
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
buy
or
trade
for
this
one
again

very

mild

with

theres
some

pours
cloudy

reddish
brown
without

head
smells
very
sour
i
know
its
supposed
to
smell
like
cherries
but
even
searching
for
it
its
tough
to
find
behind
the
sourness
slight
astringent
taste
just
as
the
beer
hits
your
mouth
but
it
quickly
fades
to
sourness
and
dark
cherries
which
are
much
more
prevalent
now
than
in
the
smell
some
dark
plum
and
blackberry
flavors
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
balanced

it
is

stomach
ive
had
this
a
bunch
more
times
and
various
vintages
and
all
i
can
say
is
this
one
has
never
let
me
down
d
a
beer
to
be
sipped
though
not
in
your
face
gigantic
flavors
i
could
chug
this
if

had
to

rather
enjoy

bottle
thanks
a
bunch
to
numbeercruncher
for
sending
this
my
way
the
first
sniff
was
cherries
and
i
expected
something
akin
to
supplication
but
as
i
poured
this
into
my
snifter
i
quickly
realized
that
this
is
a
totally
different
animal
dark
brown
with
red
tints
it
has
a
hint
of
cherry
in
the
smell
but
there
is
a
lot
of
barrel
going
on
here
wood
whiskey
the
taste
is
more
bourbon
barrel
wood
slightly
sour
interesting
mix
of
flavors
overall
this
was
interesting
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
the
bourbon
flavors
are
good
but
dont
seem
to
match
up
with
the
sour
flavors
and
really
start
to
wear
on
me
after
a
while
i
wonder
what
this
beer
would
be
like
if
they
had
only
used
wine
barrels
a
very
complex
different
beer
was
expecting
the
quad
to
come
through
a
bit
more
but
still
quite
commendable
i
still
dont
get
the
lack
of
carbonation
ive
had
recently
in
a
lot
of
lost
abbey
beers
this
would
be
that
much
better
with
some
overall
clearly
one
to
get
but
a
little
less
than
i
was
expecting
maybe
its
the
utter
scarcity
ive
got
a
couple
more
bottles
well
see
how
this
one
ages
wow
this
really
was
a
pleasure
to
sit
down
and
sip
at
a
fantastic
marriage
of
brett
cherries
quad
character
and
oak
aging
that
drinks
incredibly
well
for
its
size

the

certainly
lends
a

carefully

thing

more
dry

it

no
real
love
lost
though
by
any
means
a
good
sipper
and
that

definitely
worthy
of
having
again

this
was
one
strange
crazy
beer
though
its
exactly
what
youd
expected
from
a
quad
aged
in
oak
barrels
with
cherries
not
one
id
try
often
least
of
all
because
of
the
price
tag
but
a
tasty

beer
if
youre
into
wild
ales
drinkability
this
is
most
definitely
a
sipper
there
is
a
almost
bitter
part
of
the
taste
that
lies
somewhere
in
the
middle
that
seems
just
bit
off
to
me
its
the
only
thing
that
is
stopping
me
from
a
perfect
5
on
the
taste
its
definitely
hit
that
sweet
spot
in
terms
of
sourness
and
the
cherries
are
really

to
lost
abbey
and
the
sinners
club
the
pour
was
still
muddy
brown
not
particularly
attractive
but
who
cares
the
nose
is
quite
awesome
with
a
pronounced
chocolate
character
some
oxidation
a
little
more
vinegar
than
im
used
to
and
less
cherry
while
staying
fruity
the
cocoa
character
is
awesome
this
beer
is
surprisingly
boozy
with
a
big
barrel
character
the
palate
opens
with
plenty
of
bourbon
with
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
more
than
from
the
more
recent
vintages
some
oxidation
is
present
the
bourbon
really
dominates
the
sourness
is
comparatively
lower
too
medium
in
body
and
relatively
flat
this
was
a
treat
to
try
if
i
were
to
score
the
stm
id
give
it

dark
brown
with
a
reddish
attractive
in
a
tulip
or
stem
this
beer
has
one
of
the
best
aromas
ever
it
is
an
intense
combination
of
wood
chocolate
cherries
vanilla
booze
maybe
a
little
raisin
those
aromas
are
also
in
the
taste
they
seem
to
layer
upon
each
other
and
well
in
general
i
dont
like
sour
or
tart
beer
this
one
was
a
pleasure
the
tart
cherry
made
me
want
to
sneak
another
little
sip
then
sweetness
would
come
a
long
and
confuse
me
each
little
taste
was
like
a
guilty
pleasure
there
was
a
richness
that
imo
begged
for
a
nice
cheese
this
beer
is
not
a
style
i
appreciate
and
it
still
managed
to
impress
me
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
really
have
to
try
for
yourself
375
ml
bottle
sampled
at
lost
abbey
for
rbsg
08
poured
into
a
wine
glass
shimmering
amber
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
barrel
influences
with
a
big
scotch
note
musty
wood
and
vanilla
flavor
starts
out
with
caramel
and
scotch
then
tart
overripe
cherries
shine
through
midpalate
the
sourness
and
the
booziness
make
this
a
bit
uneven
but
a
prime
candidate
for
aging
medium
bodied
with
a
semidry
finish
overall
i
was
blow
away
with
this
one
it
was
just
ridiculously
good
i
have
had
very
few
beers
that
can
live
up
to
this
kind
of
expectation
but
this
one
i
am
proud
to
say
was
one
of
them
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
any
day
it
was
just
fantastic
go
out
and
try
to
find
this
one
if
you
can
it
is
well
worth
it
one
problem
might
be
the
carbonation
level
the
flavors
while
strong
tend
to
get
a
bit
onenote
still
its
sour
with
a
splash
of
delicious
cherries
comparatively
dry
clean
aftertaste
with
a
bit
of
lingering
sour
cherry
sort
of
a
reproduction
of
a
19th
century
extremely
old
vintage
infected
strong
ale
sets
a
new
standard
pours
dark
brown
with
a
quick
khaki
colored
head
that
vanishes
into
almost
nothing
other
than
an
outer
ring
on
the
sides
swirling
the
glass
leaves
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
but
not
much
wow
smell
is
like
no
other
tart
cherries
honey
bourbon
dates
caramel
raisins
booze
and
fig
the
aroma
with
this
is
so
complex
and
full
i
know
im
missing
something
taste
begins
pretty
funky
and
sour
with
young
cherries
and
oak
the
bourbon
appears
midway
with
some
bready
characteristics
and
a
touch
of
sweet
butterscotch
aftertaste
consists
of
sour
grapes
green
apples
and
vanilla
pretty
sour
all
the
way
through
i
could
use
more
dark
fruits
on
the
tongue
light
to
medium
body
with
a
very
lively
carbonation
that
stings
the
mouth
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
12
is
pretty
scary
if
i
was
to
guess
before
knowing
the
abv
i
would
probably
say
67
very
crazy
beer
to
say
the
least
one
that
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
some
age
will
do
to
it

drinking
pretty
darn
good
right
out
of
the
bottle
murky
brown
color
nose
is
slightly
sweet
burbon
with
a
super
thin
head
tons
of
aroma
when
you
swirl
this
around
great
balance
somewhat
sour
but
then
the
finish
shows
the
burbon
barrels
oak
carmel
burbon
alc
very
nice
easy
to
see
the
sour
aspect
and
the
barrel
aged
aspect
side
by
side
in
the
same
beer
really
nice
glad
to
have
more
to
age
this
for
several
years
before
revisiting
d
this
is
an
extremely
unique
offering
and
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
though
i
would
definitely
term
this
one
as
a
sipper
carbonate
this
one
properly
and
i
think
the
score
goes
way
up
that
said
still
worth
a
try
if
you
can
score
one
i
was
excited
to
finally
get
to
try
this
as
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
darks
and
of
sour
beers
as
well
i
think
this
brewery
can
be
among
the
best
in
the
country
when
they
get
it
right
the
definitely
got
this
one
right
im
drinking
the
most
recent
bottling
of
this
for
the
review
pours
extremely
dark
brown
with
a
light
head
and
no
real
lacing
the
aroma
is
incredible
dark
fruits
rich
cherries
bitter
cocoa
and
some
nice
sourness
seellessly
blended
the
taste
is
even
better
with
those
same
wonderful
cherry
and
bitter
cocoa
flavoers
melded
together
with
a
wonderful
sourness
that
is
somewhat
restrained
but
accented
by
the
tartness
of
the
cherries
even
though
the
beer
is
quite
sour
the
chocolate
is
so
lush
and
pronounced
that
the
flavors
are
balanced
it
is
like
a
cherry
eggcream
with
brandied
cherries
the
best
quality
dark
chocolate
and
a
wonderfully
minerally
seltzer
and
some
sour
cherry
juice
added
to
funk
it
up
in
addition
the
oak
comes
through
cleanly
but
as
a
nice
additional
flavor
and
supporting
actor
rather
than
the
star
not
overwhelming
at
all
it
adds
a
firming
woody
note
and
some
sweet
vanilla
wonderfully
enjoyable
extremely
rich
and
lush
in
the
mouth
but
with
the
sour
cherry
that
cuts
right
through
that
and
makes
the
whole
thing
tremendously
delicious
what
a
tremendous
beer
bottle
from
obriens
dark
brown
color
aroma
of
sour
cherries
oak
and
some
strawberries
more
sour
cherries
wood
and
spices
very
tart
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
towards
the
end
i
was
the
only
one
who
liked
this
so
i
drank
the
entire
bottle
tastes
almost
like
a
port
and
ive
never
really
been
a
big
fan
of
ports
but
this
was
pretty
good
pours
a
smooth
rich
dark
muddy
brownish
color
smell
is
slightly
sour
cherry
and
very
smooth
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
equally
mildly
tart
with
nice
semi
dry
cherry
flavor
i
thought
this
one
was
really
nice
and
look
forward
to
trying
it
fresh
as
well
thanks
for
this
one
mike
this
poured
a
translucent
brown
in
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
the
nose
was
sour
with
vinous
scents
of
red
fruit
mainly
cherry
and
a
woodsy
element
from
the
oak
along
with
a
touch
of
baking
spices
in
the
mouth
it
was
tart
and
kept
the
red
fruit
from
the
nose
given
the
level
of
sourness
this
was
amazingly
concentrated
and
came
off
almost
fullbodied
as
well
as
lightonitsfeet
just
a
wonderful
drink
with
a
lingering
finish
notes
this
just
makes
me
appreciate
enigma
that
much
more
quite
frankly
if
this
had
the
same
mouthfeel
as
bourbon
angels
share
and
vice
versa
it
would
put
both
these
beers
in
the
a
range
poured
from
375
ml
bottle
from
release
at
lost
abbey
into
a
delirum
tremens
snifter
it
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
fizzy
off
white
head
that
was
gone
in
60
seconds
smell
is
tart
cherry
with
spiced
plum
pudding
and
a
slight
brett
funk
taste
is
raisin
dark
fruit
tart
cherries
a
mellow
oak
tannin
flavor
comes
out
along
with
vanilla
and
a
warm
alcohol
feel
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
body
with
a
dry
tart
feel
the
carbonation
is
low
for
my
taste
but
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
highly
quaffable
d
not
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
though
i
dont
think
it
is
intended
to
be
d
overall
a
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
you
have
to
love
all
of
the
experimentation
going
on
out
there
in
port
brewing
this
beer
really
stands
out
on
it
complexity
more
than
anything
else
as
each
sip
is
a
unique
experience
definitely
would
have
trouble
having
multiple
given
the
alcohol
level
since
i
am
feeling
it
a
bit
after
one
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
seems
like
a
good
beer
to
have
with
some
cheese
and
crackers
as
well
the
one
thing
hurting
the
drinkability
is
that
the
tart
flavors
are
the
ones
that
really
last
after
they
sit
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
i
start
to
tire
of
them
and
desire
another
beer
if
this
beer
was
not
a
limited
editionseasonal
limited
purchase
expensive
beer
i
could
drink
a
glass
of
it
every
night
as
it
stands
at
15
a
pop
i
am
still
thankful
i
bought
my
limit
and
i
will
ration
them
accordingly
to
make
them
last
until
the
next
release
taste
tart
cherries
bourbon
woody
finishes
with
a
dry
wine
like
kick
to
the
taste
buds
pretty
tart
and
sour
a
little
boozy
medium
body
and
carbonation
i
think
tomme
needs
to
work
on
the
carbonation
issues
of
his
beers
though
if
this
beer
was
carbonated
the
aromatics
would
have
been
more
intense
and
the
pallet
could
use
some
liveliness
this
is
probably
a
bit
tastier
than
the
black
label
russian
river
version
i
had
before
this
but
i
get
the
feeling
that
prior
versions
achieved
a
closertoperfection
result
than
this
such
is
the
vagaries
of
experiments
with
bugs
and
barrels
i
look
forward
to
sampling
future
vintages
in
the
coming
years
this
is
a
great
dinner
beer
or
substitute
for
red
wine
im
going
to
love
finishing
off
this
bottle
its
interesting
and
i
keep
going
back
for
more
but
its
never
satisfying
its
an
awesome
creation
and
maybe
this
just
needs
a
year
or
two
or
three
or
dozen
in
the
back
of
a
properly
temped
cellar
for
this
to
come
together
but
for
now
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
beguiling
entertaining
mess
drinkability
man
i
never
wouldve
guessed
it
was
over
let
alone
near
being
10
abv
very
tasty
for
sure
well
played
tomme
great
beer
overall
i
love
the
taste
and
aroma
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
for
something
so
strong
perhaps
something
happened
in
transit
from
ca
to
cause
the
film
or
cherry
skinlike
substance
im
not
going
to
dock
the
appearance
or
mouthfeel
too
much
because
i
think
this
is
probably
just
something
unique
to
my
bottle
id
love
to
try
this
again
t
up
front
is
slight
sour
cherry
and
other
fruity
taste
with
a
whole
face
full
of
brettnomyces
which
seems
to
be
the
case
with
most
of
lost
abbeys
special
release
beers
as
this
beer
tastes
perfectly
crafted
i
can
tell
that
with
age
the
beer
will
come
together
more
as
the
sour
notes
are
having
a
hard
time
blending
with
the
malt
foundation
but
who
can
really
say
anything
bad
when
there
is
just
too
much
flavor
goin
on
in
a
beer
so
look
for
my
followup
review
in
a
couple
months
glory
glory
hallelujah
drinkability
goes
down
ridiculously
easy
for
an
11
brew
the
balance
of
flavors
and
lack
of
noticeable
alcohol
make
this
incredibly
drinkable
stuff
finally
got
to
try
this
after
hearing
so
much
about
it
further
proves
why
lost
abbey
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
cherries
do
this
beer
wonders
because
i
could
not
stand
judgment
day
by
itself
will
definitely
be
drinking
my
other
bottles
of
this
in
the
next
couple
months
highly
recommended
amazing
ale
the
is
worth
your
time
and
money
get
it
while
you
can
each
batch
is
different
with
this
and
the
angels
share
its
very
easy
to
see
why
lost
abbey
brews
are
so
highly
regarded
and
so
sought
after
i
feel
privileged
to
be
close
enough
to
the
brewery
to
have
access
to
these
amazing
beers
aquire
at
all
costs
big
thanks
to
ba
owsley069
for
sharing
this
beauty
with
me

little
to
no

than
a
thin
creamcolored
collar
woody
grapecherry
nose
melded
with
some
cedary
notes
and
a
healthy
dosage
of
brett
hints
of
bourbon
lovely
sourness
with
suggestions
of
a
dayold
manhattan
glass
some
sour
cherry
and
significant
oakiness
lightly
sweet
yet
lightly
astringent
but
finishes
dry
lowly
yet
amply
carbonated
some
beers
are
just
difficult
for
me
to
formulate
words
for
this
gem
is
one
of
them
mindblowing
to
say
the
least
third
tasting
the
new
lost
abbey
version
is
pretty
much
the
same
exact
blend
as
the
russian
river
bottling
as
far
as
i
can
tell
not
quite
as
complex
yet
but
this
was
the
first
batch
thjey
released
at
the
new
brewery
i
believe
that
by
the
second
or
third
batch
at
the
nrew
brewery
this
will
be
one
of
the
most
magical
beers
in
the
land
truly
a
piece
of
modern
art
pours
a
ruddy
brown
color
with
garnet
hues
fairly
hazy
and
very
still
with
just
a
few
bubbles
appearing
cherries
come
through
nicely
in
the
aroma
both
tart
and
sweet
like
tart
cherries
dipped
in
sugar
the
sweet
cherry
blends
with
a
light
vanilla
and
a
deep
woodiness
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
also
a
great
blend
of
sweet
cherry
flavor
along
with
a
well
balanced
tartness
light
vanilla
complements
the
cherries
and
a
dry
oak
flavor
begins
mid
taste
and
lasts
in
the
aftertaste
the
11
is
unnoticeable
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
very
little
carbonation
a
slightly
tannic
bitterness
blends
nicely
with
a
drying
woodiness
in
the
finish
delicious
beer
with
the
perfect
blend
of
sweet
and
tart
all
accentuated
by
the
cherry
and
wood
notes
had
it
on
tap
during
the
anniversary
party
at
the
lost
abbey
and
remember
the
cherries
and
sourness
coming
in
more
than
last
years
bottled
version
but
the
level
of
bourbon
was
very
nice
and
rich
as
it
was
last
year
the
bottle
that
i
opened
up
tonight
had
a
pretty
big
sourness
as
well
cherries
were
really
good
but
i
couldnt
detect
much
if
any
bourbon
character
at
all
body
is
full
and
smooth
with
very
light
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
long
on
this
one
allowing
you
an
extra
bit
of
enjoyment
deliciously
drinkable
and
worth
the
hype
d
i
think
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
havent
had
one
like
it
very
complicated
and
complex
im
not
sure
if
its
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
but
if
i
get
the
chance
to
drink
it
again
i
will
jump
on
it
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
small
tan
head
that
did
not
last
at
all
aromas
that
are
dark
cherries
vanilla
cedar
oak
and
bourbon
hints
in
the
taste
sour
cherries
and
a
woody
sourness
kind
of
like
a
huge
rodenbach
a
sour
fruity
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
sour
cherry
bourbon
aftertaste
complex
with
the
sour
cherry
bourbon
notes
and
woody
charcteristics
fantastic
beer
this
was
a
very
intersting
offering
nothing
else
like
it
in
my
opinion
to
me
it
was
so
much
like
wine
and
unfortunately
i
have
little
knowledge
of
wines
perhaps
i
am
not
worthy
but
i
would
love
to
experience
again
the
depth
and
complexity
of
this
beer

quickly
cloaks
itself
in

world
of
sourness
the
best
of
both
worlds
trying
to
parse
out
the
intricate
corners
of
the
beer
im
at
a
loss
its
all
too
much

quickly
comes
to

the

character
so
deft
real
and
upfront
palate
couldnt
be
more
satisfying
yet
exacting
ill
review
again
with
a
bottle
of
the
current
batch
but
i
needed
to
expunge
my
thoughts
with
this
rarest
of
gems
the
carbonation
is
tight
and
compliments
this
beers
punch
highly
recommended
if
you
can
score
a
bottle
d
scrumptious
i
try
not
to
use
that
word
sounds
a
bit
flamboyant
and
pretentious
if
you
ask
me
but
in
this
casei
cant
help
myself
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
i
will
have
it
again
i
love
it
what
more
do
i
need
to
say
the
beer
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
this
beer
definitely
has
the
look
and
aroma
of
a
nice
fruity
port
the
taste
was
of
a
nice
low
carbonated
earthy
brew
with
slight
taste
of
oaking
from
the
aging
process
the
12
abv
makes
this
a
nice
dessert
drink
to
sip
on
and
that
is
how
i
had
it
the
alcohol
is
apparent
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeeldrinkability
excellent
pleasing
texture
in
the
mouth
the
gentle
prickle
of
carbonation
recedes
and
becomes
almost
spongy
giving
me
something
to
chew
on
as
i
take
in
all
of
the
flavors
this
beer
is
enormous
in
its
proportions
yet
fantastically
drinkable
i
want
to
sip
and
savor
this
one
all
night
i
know
that
when
its
gone
its
gone
forever
this
is
a
rare
treat
that
is
impossible
to
replenish
thank
you
tomme
and
all
of
your
creative
inspired
brew
team
for
this
experience
thanks
again
to
the

from

i
got
this
right
around
christmas
2
years
ago
with
a

and

bottle

thus
i
was
afforded
that
chance
to
see
what
a
little

does

2003
at
pizza
ports
belgian
beer
fest
in
carlsbad
this
beer
is
really
a
treat
its
just
the
perfect
american
take
on
a
classic
belgian
stye
it
tasted
like
sour
cherry
lemonade
hints
of
barnyard
funk
that
were
buried
under
the
strong
lemon
tartness
mixed
with
the
perfect
hint
of
cherry
sourness
the
oak
provided
an
unbelievable
barrel
character
that
tied
the
beer
together
its
truly
a
special
beer
bottle
poured
a
clear
yellow

ale
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
aroma
of
funky
notes
with
clearly
identifiable
sour
notes
with
some
acidic
notes
also
noticeable
is
quite
intense
taste
is
also
dominated
by
funky
notes
with
some
sharp
sour
notes
quite
a
bit
of
acidity
and
a
short
finale
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
i
get
what
they
are
trying
to
do
and
i
also
get
why
people
enjoy
this
but
in
my
opinion
while
this
is
a
great
beer
there
is
a
lack
of
balance
and
too
much
acidity
in
the
end
drank
this
in
celebration
of
my
engagement
doesnt
get
any
better
than
that
or
does
it
overall
maybe
i
have
odd
taste
in
sour
beers
but
this
one
certainly
doesnt
blow
me
away
it
tastes
good
is
well
done
but
i
dont
understand
what
sets
this
apart
from
hundreds
of
other
sours
overall
one
of
the
most
balanced
beers
within
this
style
i
have
had
so
far
very
drinkable
and
extremely
tasty
happy
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
this
is
whale
status
thanks
to
these
guys
for
bringing
the
2013
edition
to
gabf
this
year
the
line
was
worth
it
although
i
think
the
hype
out
shines
this
one
a
little
and
i
frankly
took
more
away
from
the
framboise
de
amorosa
than
i
did
from
this
one
still
elite
level
sour
beer
here
blonde
and
hazy
in
the
look
with
an
enormous
gushing
white
head
that
never
settles
the
nose
is
lambic
like
oaky
and
quite
sour
with
lemons
being
the
leader
of
a
fruit
gang
that
also
seems
to
include
white
grapefruit
chardonnay
grapes
and
orange
wheaty
base
is
real
simple
lets
the
funky
critters
shine
and
shine
they
do
moderate
body
with
maxed
out
carbonation
moves
a
little
too
swiftly
though
the
experience
for
me
and
my
two
ounce
pour
wasnt
really
enough
to
contemplate
this
one
the
way
i
otherwise
might
but
a
second
dose
clarified
what
i
suspected
from
the
first
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
partially
famous
because
its
awesome
and
partially
famous
because
its
a
standard
setter
it
came
before
a
lot
of
the
other
new
wave
sours
that
everyone
loves
its
a
precursor
to
a
trend
and
i
respect
it
highly
in
that
context
the
beer
just
didnt
seem
to
have
the
depth
of
some
others
not
missing
anything
per
se
but
i
expected
the
world
here
not
let
down
just
dont
all
the
way
get
it
the
fruitiness
is
nice
and
the
sourness
is
reserved
and
mature
but
definitely
distinct
not
way
different
from
duck
duck
in
a
lot
of
ways
although
i
think
this
a
much
more
highly
refined
brew
overall
outstanding
but
less
compelling
than
i
hoped
for
i
will
have
to
get
a
bottle
and
give
it
more
attention
o
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
ddg
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
two
considering
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
cc
i
would
have
to
go
with
ddg
they
are
both
on
par
in
terms
of
taste
but
the
difficulty
pushes
me
away
o
such
a
treat
and
what
a
surprise
amazed
this
is
holding
up
so
well
a
wonderful
wild
ale
only
minor
flaw
is
the
lack
of
complexity
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
it
definitely
holds
back
on
the
funk
unlike
drie
fonteinen
and
cantillon
but
has
a
wonderful
complexities
and
restraint
o
very
aggressive
but
not
as
complex
as
duck
duck
gooze
is
in
my
mind
this
beer
is
somewhere
in
between
beat
and
ddg
on
the
spectrum
of
awas
aggressive
but
with
a
solid
layer
of
complexity
thats
done
very
well
with
time
this
one
did
not
disappoint
though
its
still
a
longstanding
philosophical
question
as
to
whether
it
is
worth
what
it
requires
to
obtain
a
bottle
of
this
while
i
would
recommend
going
after
duck
duck
gooze
or
beatification
instead
of
this
one
please
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
an
excellent
awa
d
its
lost
some
character
over
6
years
and
not
made
up
for
it
with
sour
development
whereas
beatification
is
explosive
and
overbearing
and
ddg
is
fresh
and
focused
i
find
this
sitting
somewhere
in
the
middle
overall
cable
car
is
a
great
american
wild
ale
but
as
with
so
many
beers
it
is
no
where
near
the
hype
i
wonder
how
the
earlier
vintages
compare
to
the
2013
pours
a
clear
light
peach
color
with
almost
one
finger
of
white
head
head
dissipates
pretty
quickly
but
maintains
a
thin
collar
aromas
of
white
grape
brett
light
peach
and
mild
funk
funk
is
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
but
is
still
on
the
mild
side
with
nice
brett
presence
tart
without
being
overly
sour
with
a
nice
white
wine
aspect
to
the
taste
along
with
citrus
peach
and
nectarine
quite
easy
drinking
finish
is
tart
and
semidry
mouthful
is
mediumlight
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
nice
carbonation
level
i
think
i
like
ddg
a
bit
more
but
this
is
an
excellent
american
wild
pour
is
golden
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
nose
has
very
faint
barrel
with
hints
of
acetic
acid
notes
of
leathery
bret
and
orange
peel
with
a
nice
vinous
quality
taste
is
very
drinkable
sour
white
grape
skins
and
citrus
with
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
faint
leathery
bret
and
a
touch
of
citrus
towards
the
back
of
the
palate
lighter
body
and
strong
carbonation
shocking
with
a
dry
and
lightly
sour
finish
very
delicate
flavors
and
pretty
well
done
felt
this
one
needed
a
full
review
acquired
my
bottle
from
a
friend
who
was
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
a
big
thanks
to
her
for
scoring
me
a
2013
vintage
of
this
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
orange
gold
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
lots
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
and
collecting
at
the
surface
to
hold
a
strong
retention
decent
lacing
streaks
down
the
glass
with
every
sip
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
potent
its
pretty
funky
and
rank
basically
it
stinks
but
its
awesome
for
the
style
its
exactly
how
i
would
expect
it
to
smell
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
sharp
tartness
up
front
which
then
settles
into
a
really
nice
sweet
grainy
wheat
like
finish
this
beer
is
very
bold
yet
delicate
in
flavor
its
hard
to
explain
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
solid
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
definitely
something
special
and
i
believe
its
worth
seeking
out
at
least
once
id
love
to
drink
it
again
one
day
but
i
dont
want
to
drop
the
money
on
it
like
i
did
for
this
one
o
i
think
this
is
good
not
great
i
have
the
whole
vert
so
maybe
if
i
popped
open
the
09
i
would
get
a
religious
experience
but
not
yet
from
the
13
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
fruit
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
and
tart
fruitlike
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
bottle
was
hard
to
open
and
barely
a
sound
as
the
cork
came
out
barely
any
head
was
produced
as
it
poured
the
smell
is
sharply
acidic
with
not
to
much
funk
and
hints
of
apple
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
lot
of
acidity
but
not
to
much
else
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
low
carbonation
highly
puckering
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
sour
just
kind
of
one
dimensional
and
under
carbed
not
worth
what
a
lot
if
people
trade
o
delicate
but
vibrant
delicious
american
wild
the
fruity
notes
that
came
out
were
great
despite
no
fruit
being
added
thanks
again
to
kevan
for
sharing
verdict
a
remarkable
sour
from
the
lost
abbey
that
rivals
anything
being
made
in
america
currently
the
fruit
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
remarkable
and
while
it
lacks
slightly
in
funk
and
barnyard
character
it
is
really
a
well
rounded
and
balanced
sour
overall
not
a
complex
sour
but
very
well
made
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
t
pretty
sour
right
away
with
a
big
lemon
warhead
kick
layers
of
unripe
green
apple
and
sour
red
cherry
and
just
a
touch
of
funk
finish
leaves
just
a
touch
of
dryness
on
the
tongue
with
a
lingering
sourness
tight
prickly
carbonation
works
perfectly
in
here
large
bubble
thin
head
a
weird
orange
color
head

is
cloudy
wheat

the
best

very
delicious
a

and
a

for
a

d
a
joy
to
finally
try
at
toronado
in
san
diego
wanted
to
pull
the
trigger
on
this
years
ago
but
so
expensive
o
overall
this
was
my
personal
whale
and
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
it
is
definitely
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
i
really
like
that
dimension
so
were
good
o
a
fantastic
awa
that
has
held
up
nicely
though
not
sure
how
much
longer
it
will
hold
out
thankful
i
was
able
to
give
this
one
a
try

sticky

pretty
much
a

sour
beer
where
the
near

it
tough
for

stick

as
much
fresh
and
tart
bretty

comes
into

a
beer
that
exhibits
a
sweet
and
sour
play
on
the

that
is
hard
to
describe
with

overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
it
was
missing
that
wow
factor
for
me
still
quite
nice
and
i
wouldnt
turn
down
more
o
this
beer
is
something
else
each
vintage
was
different
and
special
in
its
own
way
but
id
say
the
07
or
09
were
the
tops
im
honestly
surprised
to
see
how
well
these
are
holding
up
and
think
they
could
go
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
any
of
the
loons
or
3f
out
there
o
an
extremely
solid
american
wild
may
not
be
super
fair
to
put
this
up
against
everything
else
it
doesnt
fall
short
per
se
its
a
very
very
good
sour
similar
carbonation
and
appearance
to
2009
more
funk
than
fruit
and
not
quite
as
sour
as
the
2009
drink
very
tasty
and
much
creamier
than
the
09
i
can
see
this
one
aging
very
well

this
was
incredible
im
glad
to
have
skipped
the
line
at
churchills
for
this
this
is
a
great
sour
with
lots
of
citrusy
complexity
and
a
great
mouthfeel
o
what
an
excellent
beer
people
say
that
this
is
the
best
year
so
far
though
im
thrilled
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
the
thing
is
as
good
as
cable
car
proves
to
be
its
really
not
necessarily
any
better
than
the
readily
available
russian
river
sours
that
sit
on
shelves
within
their
range
of
distribution
with
this
in
mind
cable
car
is
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
praise
but
not
the
hype
at
the
alcohol
level
a
whole
bottle
of
this
would
be
a
sinch
to
a
sour
lover
alas
thats
never
going
to
happen
lost
abbey
sure
can
brew
some
sours
and
cc
is
no
slouch
this
is
cable
car
and
its
great
tasting
it
after
the
2008
and
2009
its
not
my
favorite
but
as
a
sour
beer
its
still
world
class
and
something
for
brewers
to
aspire
to
pours
a
relatively
clear
golden
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
hangs
around
and
leaves
light
rings
of
lacing
aroma
is
surprisingly
funky
and
complex
with
lemon
and
green
apple
sourness
dominating
more
fruit
and
tart
than
earthiness
but
there
is
light
straw
and
grass
throughout
as
well
body
is
very
citric
and
crisp
full
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
flavor
start
with
lemon
and
other
citrus
rind
before
becoming
more
oaky
and
tart
with
only
lingering
sourness
expected
to
be
let
down
by
this
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
look
forward
to
trying
other
vintages
ive
never
had
anything
perfect
but
this
was
o
fantastic
well
worth
the
price
tag
and
visit
to
toronado
i
managed
to
share
about
6
ounces
with
my
wife
and
i
honestly
regretted
letting
that
much
get
away
light
body
with
minimal
carbonation
a
slight
prick
of
a
bubble
here
and
there
but
expected
for
a
wild
ale
very
easy
to
drink
but
one
to
savor
with
how
nice
it
is
at
two
years
old
hopefully
toronado
still
has
a
2010
bottle
available
when
my
birthday
approaches
in
a
few
weeks
as
i
was
hoping
to
go
open
one
then
excellent
beer
d
sessionable
even
at
40bottle
although
to
be
honest
i
wont
be
ordering
this
again
while
theres
still
an
available
stock
of
11
kriek
cheers
d
what
can
i
say
this
was
a
great
beer
very
happy
to
have
finally
tried
it
at
first
i
didnt
get
it
but
the
beer
eventually
showed
me
what
was
up
seek
out
if
you
like
sours
o
lost
abbeys
cable
car
comes
about
as
close
to
perfect
as
any
brew
ive
ever
encountered
it
does
everything
right
with
not
only
ease
but
a
deft
touch
absolutely
worthy
of
the
epic
hype
and
them
some
this
brewing
masterpiece
easily
receives
my
highest
recommendation
happy
30th
to
me
overall
the
flavor
is
great
and
sour
throughout
and
each
flavor
note
is
so
robust
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
honestly
this
is
a
great
wild
ale
worth
the
hype
maybe
but
definitely
not
worth
the
difficulty
in
getting
a
bottle
outside
of
toronado
glad
i
didnt
have
to
this
is
a
great
sour
so
well
done
i
understand
the
hype
on
this
beer
finish
has
some
citric
notes
but
somewhat
dry
earthy
finish
as
well
exceptional
beer
o
good
this
is
a
solid
gueuze
but
not
outlandishly
good
d
very
drinkable
the
sour
and
tart
flavors
are
outstandingly
balanced
from
start
to
end
here
it
was
really
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
regardless
of
the
price
since
i
felt
it
was
really
that
good
this
is
good
id
love
to
drink
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
the
one
to
trade
for
them
despite
the
enjoyable
tartness
and
light
fruit
flavors
i
was
underwhelmed
by
this
ive
heard
the
bottles
taste
better
however
so
im
looking
forward
to
trying
it
another
time
a
really
good
wild
ale
with
a
balanced
funk
character
good
tartness
and
solid
flavour
cheers
update
after
flying
to
san
francisco
and
bellying
up
to
the
bar
at
toronado
with
a
bottle
of
09
cable
car
i
realized
that
i
might
have
just
hit
the
apex
in
my
pursuit
of
sourwild
ales
2007
bottle
big
thanks
to
gtreid
for
the
share
and
to
mikesgroove
for
trading
this
bottle
to
him
in
the
first
place
the
brew
pours
a
radiant
golden
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
filmy
white
head
my
glass
is
quite
translucent
due
to
a
careful
pour
the
nose
is
very
nice
although
slightly
too
understated
for
me
lemon
green
apple
skin
cut
grass
and
tannic
oak
are
the
mainstay
of
the
aroma
and
it
is
quite
similar
to
a
mild
hanssens
gueuze
in
smell
the
flavor
ramps
up
the
complexity
and
intensity
relative
to
the
aroma
and
the
result
is
outstanding
perfect
tartness
notes
of
lemon
juice
and
zest
kaffir
lime
nectarine
green
apple
general
acidity
and
woody
notes
are
observed
on
the
palate
the
feel
is
very
smooth
whilst
retaining
tooth
and
has
an
unbelievably
clean
finish
overall
i
am
very
impressed
worthy
of
the
hype
better
than
ddg
almost
as
good
as
ip
i
cannot
yet
make
a
yb
comparison
from
notes
finally
coughed
up
the
40
for
this
treat
it
was
worth
every
single
penny
2009
vintage
at
san
francisco
toronado
pours
a
light
goldenamber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
the
carbonation
is
looking
quite
delightful
on
this
beer
scent
is
very
funky
with
some
intense
lactic
sour
notes
as
the
beer
warms
the
fruit
really
comes
out
i
get
some
sweet
pear
aromas
along
with
peach
and
apricot
the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
i
went
into
this
with
high
expectations
and
i
was
not
let
down
mouth
puckering
much
more
sour
than
expected
there
are
some
sweet
pear
flavors
with
lemon
and
a
close
resemblance
to
sweet
tarts
candy
mouthfeel
is
extremely
dry
and
puckering
on
the
inside
of
my
cheeks
tongue
and
roof
of
my
mouth
drinkability
is
high
as
this
beer
is
just
so
damn
tasty
overall
im
just
very
happy
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
it
exceeded
in
all
aspects
good
job
lost
abbey
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
each
sip
is
more
enjoyable
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
very
aromatic
and
fruity
but
not
sweet
drinking
amazingly
right
now
the
sour
interacts
perfectly
with
the
fruity
taste
o
this
is
one
great
beer
i
dont
like
the
overpowering
sourness
of
many
wilds
but
this
one
is
just
about
perfect
for
me
i
would
put
this
at
the
top
of
the
list
in
terms
of
sours
skal
pops
open
with
a
bit
of
a
gush
but
the
pour
smacks
the
head
in
the
face
and
you
get
a
pour
with
almost
no
head
bubbles
gently
caress
the
outskirts
of
the
bottle
it
pours
a
golden
rod
yellow
and
is
very
opaque
the
smell
is
very
fruity
but
not
very
yeasty
as
some
american
wild
ales
tend
to
be
the
tartness
is
also
very
well
toned
down
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
very
playful
its
not
too
light
a
very
refreshing
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
definite
a
but
the
drinkability
of
it
is
kind
of
low
unless
you
have
an
in
with
toronado
crew
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
2010
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
ws
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
sour
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
funk
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
quite
excellent
my
only
gripe
about
this
one
was
that
the
flavor
was
quite
subdued
while
the
flavor
was
great
it
just
seemed
slightly
watered
down
compared
to
the
other
offerings
i
have
had
as
of
late
the
aroma
on
this
however
was
nothing
short
of
excellent
though
how
good
was
this
one
you
might
ask
myself
and
kenneyho
started
using
it
as
a
palate
cleanser
at
around
2am
that
morning
definitely
worth
the
buzz
that
surrounds
this
one
hope
to
try
some
older
vintages
for
comparison
in
the
future
for
comparison
hint
hint
traders
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
beer
glad
i
made
the
journey
to
get
it
but
dont
think
id
do
it
again
3
5
d
good
beer
but
it
isnt
as
impressive
at
least
not
this
vintage
as
the
reputation
suggests
however
if
nothing
else
it
is
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
good
value
for
20
barely
acceptable
for
30
but
40
is
far
too
much
after
the
novelty
is
achieved
medium
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
theres
a
pleasant
dry
finish
following
the
lactic
acidity
very
drinkable
though
i
wouldnt
object
to
a
little
more
acidity
which
im
sure
varies
according
to
the
vintage
personally
i
wouldnt
give
up
the
farm
for
this
but
wouldnt
pass
up
a
chance
to
try
it
overall
well
worth
the
40
00
price
tag
when
split
5
ways
o
pretty
good
but
not
as
good
as
previous
vintages
still
an
excellent
wild
ale
and
worth
seeking
out
overall
great
very
drinkable
light
tartness
nice
dry
light
bready
funk
even
has
some
carbonation
o
i
would
drink
this
over
and
over
again
mouthfeel
thin
bodied
medium
carbonation
just
perfect
for
this
style
i
could
drink
multiple
glasses
of
this
without
getting
sick
of
it
o
this
reminds
me
alot
like
a
shocktart
makes
your
face
pucker
but
you
go
back
for
more
the
more
i
drink
this
the
better
it
taste
to
me
this
is
definitely
not
worth
the
40
pricetag
im
glad
to
say
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
anytime
soon
overall
this
was
a
delicious
beer
that
challenges
the
taste
buds
with
the
exceptional
balance
of
citrus
sourness
and
superb
fruit
flavor
thanks
alex
o
outstanding
great
wild
ale
another
one
i
was
beginning
to
think
id
never
get
to
sample
interesting
slightly
different
combo
of
fruity
flavors
in
a
wild
and
balanced
very
well
with
a
distinct
but
manageable
tartnesssourness
orangyyellow
with
a
tiny
amount
of
head
the
nose
is
tart
lemon
with
a
nice
funky
sour
smell
like
funkspiked
lemonade
the
taste
is
like
the
nose
sour
funky
dry
lemonade
no
booze
comes
off
at
all
this
beer
is
light
and
freshing
if
this
beer
came
in
9
6packs
i
would
enjoy
them
all
summer
long
really
a
fantastic
easy
drinking
sour
if
you
havent
enjoyed
sours
before
this
is
a
really
nice
entry
point
too
bad
it
is
so
difficult
to
get
narrative
sir
fredrick
willingsly
is
repossessing
your
car
you
cant
hate
him
for
doing
his
job
but
without
a
1998
civic
dx
these
pizzas
arent
going
to
deliver
themselves
you
hate
him
with
his
cliche
antagonistic
handlebar
moustache
and
fogged
up
monocle
however
his
wry
quips
relating
to
howards
end
and
class
struggle
made
it
all
the
sweeter
and
thence
upon
from
which
one
has
had
none
shall
take
without
he
declares
with
a
cloud
of
aplomb
that
almost
makes
you
lighthearted
in
his
usurpation
of
your
chief
economic
asset
he
is
akin
to
the
mr
peanut
of
recurring
vengeance
your
pocket
despises
him
yet
you
respect
him
for
his
casuistic
enforcement
of
the
law
god

dont

my
sick
mugen

godspeed
very
good
very
expensive
expensive
cant
get
a
perfect
overall
score
when
youre
40
and
only
available
at
2
bars
one
of
which
sucks
ass
o
i
was
glad
to
have
tried
this
but
given
the
exclusivity
and
price
tag
probably
wont
search
it
out
again
it
was
good
but
better
similar
beers
can
be
found
much
more
easily
over
all
pretty
damn
tasty
and
cant
wait
to
do
a
side
by
side
car
tasting
with
the
2010
o
such
a
wonderful
beer
having
it
at
the
toronado
only
makes
it
a
more
memorable
experience
what
a
night
o
overall
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
im
really
glad
it
actually
lived
up
to
my
expectations
had
a
lot
of
great
beers
at
dld
and
this
one
was
probably
my
favorite
lots
of
sour
and
tart
lemons
and
while
not
overly
sour
its
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
by
a
bottle
of
this
one
when
and
if
i
make
it
out
to
toronado
a
huge
thanks
to
jedwards
for
sharing
this
beer
2009
vintage
served
in
a
sinners
tulip
the
color
of
this
beer
is
really
quite
eyecatching
bright
tangerine
in
color
with
a
loose
bright
white
head
and
a
semihazy
clarity
the
head
is
refreshed
with
a
gentle
swirl
of
the
glass
and
sheets
of
lacing
coat
the
sides
of
the
glass
gradually
yielding
to
some
strands
and
spots
of
lacing
encircling
the
bowl
nose
is
fairly
subdued
tart
citrus
and
a
trace
of
cork
taste
reveals
tart
and
acidic
citrus
fruit
a
slightly
salty
character
and
the
flavor
of
cork
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
an
effervescence
akin
to
champagne
this
beer
is
so
tart
that
it
puckers
the
cheeks
before
culminating
in
a
very
dry
finish
this
has
to
be
by
far
the
sourest
sour
ive
had
to
date
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
and
im
grateful
to
finally
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
outside
of
a
fest
pours
a
pretty
golden
yellow
a
bit
hazy
with
a
nice
amount
of
white
head
smell
is
phenomenal
tons
of
tart
sour
lemons
with
a
nice
grassy
touch
the
sour
kick
is
very
prominent
but
not
offputting
like
some
overly
sour
beers
ive
had
tastes
very
mellow
lots
of
tart
lemon
with
a
sourness
that
melds
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
the
flavour
profile
is
predominently
lemon
with
some
nice
grassy
tones
in
the
background
overall
solid
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
my
favourite
sour
to
date
the
carbonation
is
very
active
prickly
on
the
tongue
throughout
most
of
the
bottle
a
little
drying
overall
wow
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
have
this
one
worth
the
wait
o
way
too
expensive
but
a
very
tasty
brew
may
have
to
bring
a
couple
friends
to
drink
one
of
these
next
time
overall
its
a
great
one
price
tag
is
high
but
im
on
vacation
drink
forever
d
drinks
so
quickly
and
the
carbonation
helps
save
the
palate
excellent
beer
pretty
much
all
i
drank
first
night
of
10
gabf
great
glowing
pour
silky
head
nose
is
quite
sour
with
lots
of
fruit
and
sweet
malt
notes
taste
is
perfectly
balanced
belgianesque
as
usual
vinny
cimplex
and
refreshing
great
stuff
could
drink
any
time
d
nice
refreshing
light
balanced
beer
this
is
one
i
could
finish
myself
and
still
want
more
truly
a
worldclass
beer
d
quite
high
how
could
i
not
give
this
a
five
i
drank
the
entire
bottle
in
one
sitting
and
i
barely
felt
it
not
too
tart
like
some
of
the
other
wilds
i
have
had
recently
nice
and
refreshing
i
wish
this
wasnt
such
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
get
i
would
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
for
special
occasions
quite
tasty
stuff
for
sure
09
bubblier
than
the
08
big
acetone
notes
the
most
tart
of
any
and
the
harshest
still
a
great
beer
though
interesting
and
complex
cable
car
is
a
pretty
good
wild
ale
that
doesnt
leave
your
tongue
feeling
like
it
took
a
beating
but
maintains
a
lot
of
sourness
with
that
said
i
really
wouldnt
pay
forty
bucks
at
toronado
for
a
bottle
well
if
i
could
go
back
in
time
i
wouldnt
anyway
bottle
2010
vintage
had
at
toronado
san
diego
so
excited
saw
this
beauty
behind
be
glass
cooler
and
just
had
to
have
it
even
at
40bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
slightly
hazed
amber
gold
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
collar
and
leaves
lace
the
aroma
is
very
nice
a
blend
of
sweet
grape
fruit
and
a
nice
sourness
as
well
very
white
wineish
light
mothfeel
with
a
fai
bit
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
nice
but
not
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
being
the
2010
im
not
surprised
it
hasnt
fully
soured
up
yet
slightly
sweet
start
like
apricot
gives
way
to
some
funkiness
finishes
dry
like
a
white
wine
splendid
i
like
the
fruit
rather
than
funk
oriented
lost
abbey
sour
character
present
in
this
ddg
brouwers
imagination
ip
i
wish
it
had
more
funk
but
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
and
time
seems
to
be
helping
it
a
lot
from
reports
i
heard
of
this
initially
d
easy
drinker
and
very
enjoyable
just
wish
it
were
a
little
more
affordable
overall
lost
abbey
has
failed
to
impress
me
on
so
many
levels
however
this
beer
and
vintage
might
be
the
exception
might
be
one
of
the
best
american
sours
i
have
had
aside
from
deviation
over
all
a
great
beer
this
vintage
is
certainly
young
and
needs
some
more
time
to
develop
and
creat
the
tart
sour
flavors
that
are
missing
d
hugely
dirnkable
very
balanced
in
every
way
tartness
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
and
this
is
one
of
the
fruitiest
awas
that
ive
had
in
a
while
7
is
not
high
but
alcohol
seems
nearly
nonexistant
here
never
thought
id
say
this
but
worth
the
price
overall
a
very
good
sour
for
sure
just
not
sure
if
its
the
best
i
prefer
duck
duck
gooze
andor
isabelle
proximus
over
cable
car
a
must
try
cheers
ive
had
this
beer
a
number
of
times
a
fresh
bottle
is
about
as
sour
as
it
gets
imo
i
had
this
a
few
times
in
all
vintages
i
opened
a
batch1
about
10
months
ago
and
remember
that
it
was
alot
less
sour
and
funky
it
had
supprised
me
how
much
it
had
faded
over
time
cable
car
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
american
wild
ales
i
have
yet
to
try
i
would
love
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
again
2007
bottle
generously
shared
at
a
recent
chicago
crew
tasting
thanks
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
no
head
some
bubbles
here
and
there
smell
is
a
musky
spice
some
lemon
and
acidic
notes
a
bit
of
funk
taste
is
pretty
amazing
tart
orange
cinnamon
spiciness
sour
but
very
clean
some
mellow
peaches
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
low
carbonation
not
too
dry
but
finishes
clean
an
amazing
beer
different
from
any
sour
i
have
had
very
very
drinkable
pours
a
lightly
hazy
amberbrown
color
with
a
good
white
head
funky
and
tart
on
the
nose
lemon
citrus
and
aged
leather
on
the
palate
a
good
sourness
with
apples
citrus
puckering
wine
this
one
was
tart
and
dry
with
a
prickly
carbonation
didnt
think
id
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
but
i
did
and
im
glad
though
i
have
no
intention
of
ever
tracking
a
bottle
down
this
is
a
damn
tasty
bottle
of
beer
and
probably
the
ultimate
representation
of
the
american
wild
ale
style
not
too
sour
not
too
funky
highly
drinkable
d
id
drink
a
lot
if
i
could
im
not
sure
my
stomach
would
agree
i
feel
lucky
to
try
giving
circumstances
and
not
to
lie
i
tried
more
than
once

the

is
there
but
underneath
it
all
very
dry
and
tart
moreso
than
sour
or
funky
very
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
splendid
ringed
lacing
in
the
glass
with
a
white
ring
staying
on
top
of
the
golden
liquid
more
lemon
than
green
apple
with
zesty
fruity
to
say
the
least
dry
yet
glossy
citric
lemon
tart
mouthfeel
with
a
side
of
dry
funk
exceptionally
drinkable
despite
some
of
my
adjectives
above
this
really
isnt
an
esoteric
beverage
and
a
great
beer
to
share
with
good
friends
o
hmmm
is
this
a
beer
that
i
would
cross
the
world
for
or
pay
40
for
again
well
probably
not
its
too
similar
to
several
cheaper
although
also
very
limited
beers
that
i
have
in
the
cellar
but
is
it
a
beer
that
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
absolutely
d
40
for
this
beer
is
idiotic
if
it
were
outstanding
i
might
consider
paying
it
but
for
a
beer
that
is
a
misfire
out
of
the
gate
and
needs
time
to
improve
if
it
even
does
no
j
drink
easy
drinking
beer
especially
for
a
sour
possibly
too
easy
of
a
beer
for
this
style
overall
a
good
and
well
balanced
beer
but
could
have
used
a
little
more
flavor
i
will
be
interested
to
see
how
this
beer
matures
over
time
in
comparison
to
the
previous
vintages
now
that
i
have
had
this
fresh
i
prefer
this
aged
the
aged
2007
seemed
to
have
more
fruit
flavors
where
as
this
came
across
as
a
fresh
unbalanced
gueuze
would
i
pay
forty
a
bottle
again
most
likely
this
one
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
this
is
probably
the
second
best
american
sour
that
ive
had
after
rr
deviation
and
slightly
ahead
of
rr
beatification
well
done
tomme
puckering
and
tart
balanced
sourness
lemon
orange
and
grapefruit
blend
seamlessly
it
lingers
on
the
palate
with
traces
of
oak
citrus
and
grape
salivary
glands
kick
into
overdrive
clean
and
quenching
sourness
balanced
with
a
good
deal
of
wild
complexity
unique
but
maybe
not
the
pinnacle
sour
ale
from
lost
abbey
thanks
again
anwar
for
the
opportunity
i
was
very
glad
and
thankful
for
the
opportunity
but
solidifies
my
poor
overall
impression
of
lost
abbey
d
very
drinkable
as
it
is
happily
complex
and
there
is
nothing
overpowering
going
on
here
d
very
drinkable
all
around
for
a
sour
definitely
glad
to
finally
be
able
to
try
this
one
out
and
would
love
to
have
it
again
although
its
definitely
not
quite
up
there
with
isabelle
and
veritas
004
perfect
carbonation
with
some
serious
drinkability
for
a
sour
as
its
not
too
sour
amazing
stuff
overall
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
it
isnt
the
best
sour
that
ive
ever
had
but
it
does
come
very
close
well
worth
the
shot
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
2007
bottle
thanks
to
sean
found
this
to
be
very
sweet
d
chased
this
beer
for
a
couple
months
and
was
not
dissapointed
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
beer
if
it
was
avaliable
like
that
d
yeah
this
is
good
real
real
good
wish
i
had
more
but
sadly
this
is
it
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
is
about
perfect
for
the
style
overall
this
one
met
my
expectations
and
was
definitely
memorable
one
of
the
better
american
wild
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
with
a
good
level
of
tiny
bubble
carbonation
to
make
it
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
cable
car
09
by
lost
abbey
is
an
american
wild
ale
aged
in
oak
barrels
and
7
it
poured
a
hazy
straw
yellow
it
smelled
very
sour
some
chardonnay
notes
citrus
oak
wood
and
some
funk
it
tasted
like
citrus
lemon
a
hint
of
pineapple
oak
wood
and
extremely
sour
from
start
to
finish
with
some
good
bitterness
in
there
as
well
it
was
the
tartest
of
the
evening
the
beer
is
very
carbonated
which
is
something
i
really
appreciate
for
this
style
i
think
the
carbonation
compliments
the
sharp
fruit
flavors
and
overtly
sour
tones
of
the
beer
there
is
a
nice
dry
finish
that
leaves
the
palate
feeling
nice
and
clean
and
craving
more
the
crisp
flavors
dry
finish
and
well
masked
alcohol
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
overall
i
found
this
to
be
right
in
the
middle
of
isabelle
proximus
funky
and
ddg
fruity
id
like
to
think
of
this
beer
as
the
definition
of
a
sour
d
this
particular
bottle
was
the
best
of
the
cable
car
pours
that
ive
had
a
solid
sourness
and
nice
fruit
character
but
a
little
lacking
in
the
funk
department
drinkability
was
higher
than
i
originally
thought
upon
first
sip
as
you
become
acustomed
to
the
sourness
it
goes
down
easier
and
easier
until
you
want
to
just
chug
the
whole
glass
its
kind
of
like
drinking
the
sweet
tarts
candy
n
not
overly
tart
or
sour
well
done
and
damn
tasty
for
sure
there
arent
many
beers
that
are
hyped
as
much
as
cable
car
that
are
genuinely
this
good
i
love
me
a
good
wicked
tart
beer
and
this
qualifies
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
are
pungently
tart
and
dry
with
a
touch
of
the
horse
blanket
it
is
still
pretty
smooth
despite
the
intense
tartness
perhaps
a
bit
of
apple
in
there
also
one
of
the
driest
beer
beers
in
the
aftertaste
perhaps
almost
a
bit
too
much
overall
a
terriffic
beer
beer
is
medium
to
low
bodied
and
has
a
slightly
citric
sourness
to
it
nothing
much
in
the
forward
but
there
is
a
definite
and
growing
sourness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
drinkability
for
this
beer
is
really
high
and
mouthfeel
is
great
lots
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
contributes
to
the
overall
sourness
and
feel
of
this
beer
im
in
love
d
a
fine
brew
and
easy
to
sip
given
the
style
popped
and
poured
into
lost
abbey
chalices
at
toronado
it
gushed
after
popping
the
cork
it
was
hazy
golden
yellow
a
healthy
amount
of
foam
and
good
lacing
there
is
a
strong
aroma
with
plenty
of
citrus
and
some
nice
funk
the
taste
is
fantastic
they
are
notes
of
citrus
lemon
pineapple
some
nice
bitterness
some
oak
that
hoarse
blanket
goat
cheese
flavor
the
strongest
flavor
is
the
tart
sourness
its
exquisite
in
its
balance
and
complexity
it
has
a
nice
carbonation
and
it
goes
down
very
easy
its
amazingly
drinkable
you
could
sip
it
all
night
2009
version
at
toronado
so
glad
to
finally
try
it
the
first
pour
was
a
little
hazy
and
light
golden
colored
but
each
successive
pour
was
a
little
darker
and
murkier
judging
by
aroma
and
taste
this
is
exactly
what
an
american
wild
ale
should
taste
like
at
least
in
my
humble
opinion
musty
sour
barnyard
funk
some
lemon
this
is
really
not
that
far
from
some
of
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
in
belgium
lost
abbey
may
have
some
bad
press
due
to
carbonation
issues
on
high
gravity
ales
but
they
absolutely
have
wild
ales
by
the
balls
the
sour
bite
never
infringes
on
my
enjoyment
maybe
because
its
expertly
crafted
or
maybe
because
of
severe
acclimation
to
the
style
it
truly
sucks
to
like
something
so
much
when
you
know
you
cant
easily
get
it
this
will
always
be
on
my
wants
list
at
least
theres
cantillon
to
hold
me
over
overall
a
world
class
wild
ale
that
earns
all
the
hype
and
high
ratings
highest
recommendation
you
must
try
this
especially
if
you
love
wild
ales
a
bitch
to
find
but
so
worth
it
rotation
not
avail
in
tx
extremely
rare
release
if
i
could
id
have
a
bottle
constantly
in
my
fridge
and
cellar
as
is
ill
keep
searching
for
a
trade
as
well
as
having
at
the
toronadosan
diego
during
my
soon
to
be
annual
trips
out
there
this
is
a
superb
american
wild
well
balanced
but
still
nice
and
sour
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
the
same
class
as
the
t20
but
its
still
a
great
beer
overall
a
very
nice
wild
ale
nice
and
sour
just
the
way
it
should
be
i
could
go
for
a
lot
more
of
this
a
very
well
done
sour
i
hope
i
can
try
a
fresh
one
of
these
in
a
month
or
so
when
i
visit
toronado
well
continue
to
try
to
catch
it
catch
the
fog
but
we
will
never
understand
what
it
will
be
like
until
were
there
gleaming
white
robes
the
airy
tearful
metallic
tartness
that
reminds
of
sunny
fog
rainy
sunshine
the
most
beautiful
days
on
earth
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
some
of
the
08
next
to
this
and
i
must
say
that
i
think
i
prefer
this
fresh
as
the
citrus
is
more
pronounced
and
the
funk
hadnt
yet
started
to
overtake
it
that
said
this
stuff
is
the
real
deal
and
i
feel
very
fortuitous
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
on
draft
i
think
that
there
might
certainly
be
some
comparable
wilds
out
there
that
are
a
bit
easier
to
get
but
by
no
mean
pass
this
up
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
orange
hue
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
leaving
only
a
ring
around
the
glass
lactic
acid
and
citrus
in
the
nose
theres
some
funkiness
to
it
but
i
get
more
tropical
fruit
than
anything
else
lightly
spicy
on
the
tongue
with
some
barnyard
funk
and
a
little
bit
of
tropical
fruit
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
the
tropical
fruit
remained
but
more
of
a
footlike
brett
character
came
through
medium
high
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
drinkability
is
exceptional
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
this
though
availability
wont
allow
it
flavors
arent
all
that
intense
but
they
are
refined
and
lead
to
a
good
drinking
experience
great
mouthfeel
nicely
carbonated
very
drinkable
and
im
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
one
but
i
think
that
i
like
ddg
better
not
to
mention
how
much
more
attainable
it
iswas
08
and
09
sampled
side
by
side
toro
sd
during
sdbw
09
was
better
in
almost
every
facet
funk
sour
mouthfeel
and
complexity
a
step
below
something
like
ddg
both
had
similar
color
mouthfeel
ect
09
just
smelled
and
tasted
funkier
very
cool
to
try
and
both
vintages
to
boot
horse
blanket
some
citrus
wheat
and
nice
brett
ect
flavors
08
was
just
flat
in
flavor
and
funk
maybe
more
mellowed
hadnt
had
08
when
it
was
1st
released
so
maybe
on
release
it
was
like
the
09
this
nite
would
say
hold
08s
if
in
bottle
for
a
later
date
for
the
funk
to
develop
with
more
time
to
start
this
review
off
i
want
to
thank
sprinkle
for
this
delightful
oppurtunity
to
try
this
beer
i
have
just
recently
gotten
into
sours
and
wild
ales
and
i
know
that
this
was
a
very
special
treat
for
me
to
be
able
to
try
this
the
intital
taste
is
sour
but
goes
away
with
a
warmth
feeling
a
touch
of
a
salty
taste
to
it
but
not
very
predominant
this
beer
by
far
exceeded
any
expectations
i
had
for
it
again
very
blessed
to
have
tried
this
and
added
this
notch
to
my
belt
i
hate
to
repeat
myself
but
this
is
the
perfect
execution
of
funk
more
than
any
other
beer
but
it
is
a
higher
quality
funk
as
well
if
that
makes
any
sense
very
approachable
and
tasty
this
batch
seems
to
be
doing
quite
well
might
be
the
best
of
the
three
as
i
drink
it
all
i
can
think
is
this
is
how
a
beer
should
taste
dhighly
this
is
quite
delicious
not
too
tart
not
too
dull
a
wonderful
amalgamation
of
flavours
a
highly
regarded
sour
for
a
reasonfine
stuff
a
let
down
i
can
only
hope
to
acquire
a
batch
2
or
3
soon
d
i
was
pouring
for
lost
abbey
during
bbf
and
i
kept
drinking
this
i
had
the
duck
and
yellow
bus
and
sinners
but
my
glass
was
constantly
filled
with
this
i
though
this
would
be
much
more
sour
it
is
more
balanced
than
i
thought
it
would
be
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
for
me
truly
lived
up
to
the
hype
it
is
just
a
perfect
blend
of
tartpuckering
sourness
crisp
delicious
fruit
notes
and
a
dry
sweet
yet
tart
delectable
finish
this
beer
tasted
better
with
each
sip
and
my
mouth
was
literally
watering
in
anticipation
of
each
sip
this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
flavorful
sours
ive
ever
had
and
i
cannot
recommend
it
any
higher
i
only
wish
i
had
more
d
well
the
sourness
while
not
too
intense
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
in
this
case
and
i
dont
think
its
all
that
drinkable
overall
oh
yeah
and
its
way
overpriced
at
45
a
bottle
overall
wow
the
taste
was
just
out
of
this
world
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
pop
in
the
carbonation
and
appearence
but
that
being
said
it
was
still
unreal
super
damn
drinkable
and
just
absurd
worth
the
hunt
as
i
cannot
compare
it
to
anything
else
d
this
beer
makes
you
sit
back
and
appreciate
it
its
easy
to
drink
fast
but
why
its
great
to
chill
out
while
sipping
on
this
from
time
to
time
i
dont
want
this
bottle
to
end
but
im
glad
i
was
able
to
pop
this
one
open
and
enjoy
lost
abbey
you
have
done
it
yet
again
tasted
at
cleveland
tasting
on
82308
thanks
batch
2
was
poured
with
a
golden
color
and
thin
white
head
has
a
slight
funk
aroma
some
citrus
and
some
spice
has
a
medium
body
taste
is
tart
some
fruits
and
has
a
sweet
sour
finish
on
the
back
end
overall
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
considering
the
hype
around
it
i
found
it
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
its
a
solid
brew
just
not
worth
the
ratings
it
gets
here
and
i
wasnt
the
only
one
with
those
sentiments
overall
solid
and
excited
to
have
the
privilege
to
try
it
on
tap
for
5
batch

hazy
amber
pour
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
silage
and
earth
aroma
flavor
was
silage
dust
grass
earth
stomach
acid
lemon
oak
and
orange
peel
tart
dry
finish
with
the
sourness
coming
through
but
not
overpowering
the
beer
very
nice
the
2007
batch
has
noticeably
declined
since
i
last
tried
it
i
laughed
at
the
thought
before
we
opened
the
batches
side
by
side
but
it
truly
is
the
case
the
2008
is
clearly
the
better
of
the
two
at
this
point
in
time
really
unique
in
my
experience
thanks
to
chad
for
purchasing
and
sharing
this
really
glad
i
got
to
see
what
all
the
talk
is
about
rating
1300
i
will
admit
that
i
have
enjoyed
the
first
batch
a
lot
more
than
the
second
it
was
more
aggressively
sour
while
the
other
batch
was
more
subtle
and
mild
still
mouth
puckering
though
i
wish
this
brew
was
not
only
available
at
one
place
in
the
world
because
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
if
that
was
not
the
case
this
is
worth
all
the
hype
indeed
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
had
and
probably
will
ever
have
hopefully
tomme
brews
this
for
toronado
in
the
upcoming
years
because
it
is
well
worth
the
seven
hour
drive
up
to
san
francisco
to
buy
some
this
brew
is
a
masterpiece
cannot
recommend
this
enough
the
nose
is
very
nice
mildly
melony
moderately
lemony
moderate
funk
earthy
loamlike
complex
and
very
well
structured
makes
me
think
of
a
real
gueuze
in
its
delicacy
the
palate
opens
mellow
complex
funky
earthy
lemony
very
very
nice

d
drinkability
is
very
good
the
strong
flavors
and
overall
complexity
just
keeps
you
coming
back
for
sip
after
sip
this
one
goes
down
surprisingly
easy
lost
abbey
has
a
winner
with
the
cable
car
it
would
be
nice
to
see
this
one
become
more
available
in
the
future
overall
this
was
an
incredible
beer
after
having
landed
this
white
whale
im
not
certain
id
give
up
as
much
as
i
did
again
however
it
was
still
worth
it
to
try
this
rarity
im
wondering
how
different
this
is
from
the
first
batch
as
the
rumor
has
it
that
the
original
recipe
was
never
recorded
and
batch
2
is
a
recreation
this
is
a
superb
wild
ale
it
just
had
the
misfortune
of
following
up
the
sublime
deviation
and
paled
a
little
in
comparison
if
our
sour
lineup
was
analogous
to
the
lotr
trilogy
this
would
be
the
two
towers
d
one
of
the
better
wild
ales
ive
had
thus
far
big
thanks
to
akorsak
for
pulling
out
this
750ml
before
i
had
to
leave
his
tasting
on
saturday
afternoon
great
stuff
d
tasty
sour
not
sure
i
fully
understood
it
in
my
6
oz
sample
to
be
able
to
rank
it
relative
to
other
great
sours
ive
had
but
it
was
a
good
beer
just
crazy
stupid
that
this
thing
cost
50
at
toronado
though
but
i
was
willing
to
split
with
my
friends
once
in
order
to
give
it
a
try
like
a
wedding
video
im
purposely
avoiding
documentation
on
this
beer
because
i
want
it
to
live
in
my
memory
as
i
remember
it
a
special
beer
that
rewards
beer
exploration
oh
and
for
the
fella
that
hooked
up
me
pwoods
ftownthrowdown
and
yetiman420
thank
you
you

you

you
cant

cheers
d
extraordinarily
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
the
tartness
and
sourness
doesnt
linger
too
strong
or
long
very
good
yet
again
many
thanks
to
you
shane
you
really
made
my
day
and
you
better
watch
your
back
when
its
your
turn
to
be
given
a

beer
and
a
million
thanks
to
the
one
that
traded
this
to
shane
i
had
set
the
bar
extremely
high
for
this
one
so
i
suppose
a
letdown
was
inevitable
a
killer
sour
beer

not

a
rare
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
reputation
pours
hazy

with
an
oily
white
ring
lovely
perfume
nose
sour
mash
brett
and
butter
quite
sour
up
front
with
a
rhubarb
flavor
the
sour
slowly
turns
into
a
buttery
dinner
roll
tannins
and
oak
along
with
a
bit
of
cheese
show
up
too
very
acidic
at
first
but
mellows
into
a
nicely
vinuous
beer
drinkability
is
great
while
the
bigger
body
and
solid
malty
base
were
unexpected
they
really
helped
hold
it
together
a
great
balance
between
the
funk
sourness
and
malt
top
notch
stuff
if
only
i
had
more
fairly
clear
orangepeach
colour
turned
cloudy
once
the
dregs
were
poured
it
had
a
thin
whitish
cap
that
produced
thick
and
spotty

of

it
did
have
a

caramel

but
this
was
really
there
just
to
provide
balance
for
the
craziness

russ
d
it
seems
ridiculous
to
rate
the
drinkablility
of
this
beer
as
no
one
will
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
as
a
session
beer
golden
and
cloudy
with
a
bit
of
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
whispy
layer
smells
pretty
sour
without
too
much
barnyard
funk
and
with
a
little
peach
and
green
apple
taste
is
very
sour
at
the
start
but
fades
to
a
complex
and
fruity
finish
carbonation
is
well
balanced
and
does
not
detract
from
the
beer
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
im
lucky
to
have
tried
this
after
never
really
thinking
id
even
see
one
and
i
wish
there
were
a
chance
of
me
tasting
it

bottle
shared
with

of

with
green
apples
lemon
and

light

cobweb
musty
and
more
funky

it

flavor
was
lots

tart

lemon
subtle
funk
at
beginning
slight
oaky
tannins
banana
and
a
slight
alcohol
bite
as
it
warmed
slight
corn
in
after
taste
as
it
got
completely
to
room
temp
it
was
like
juicy
ripe
pineapple
and
got
more
sweet
overall
it
coats
the
mouth
with
tingly
bubbles
and
leaves
a
lasting
impression
on
the
palate
i
absolutely
loved
this
one
it
had
so
many
layers
and
subtle
flavorssmells
on
tap
at
toronado
in
august
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
sour
beer
i
was
very
impressed
hazy
golden
color
with
solid
white
head
taste
is
crisp
and
tart
fruity
oaky
and
sour
funk
is
certainly
present
but
not
excessive
which
i
appreciated
considering
the
style
which
i
generally
cant
drink
too
much
of
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
and
look
forward
to
opening
up
the
bottle
i
also
purchased
on
toronados
21st
anniversary
night
i
will
say
i
did
feel
that
i
was
a
bit
let
down
it
was
good
but
it
by
no
means
blew
me
away
this
may
be
a
beer
that
is
real
over
hyped
imho
i
can
think
of
45
belgian
geuze
that
i
would
grab
before
this
one
that
are
much
cheaper
and
readily
available
maybe
this
would
improve
with
age
had
this
at
port
night
at
toronado
the
week
after
their
21st
anniversary
party
this
is
batch
2
the
2008
one
i
had
a
couple
pours
a
totally
opaque
golden
with
almost
no
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
carbonation
level
was
fine
though
perhaps
somewhat
on
the
soft
side
but
entirely
within
a
normal
range
the
aromas
are
fairly
light
nut
a
light
funkinesss
comes
through
as
a
does
a
clean
sourness
and
a
tang
of
brine
the
taste
is
much
more
impressive
and
oddly
addictive
there
is
a
delicious
savory
component
to
the
beer
that
is
hard
to
place
but
includes
a
tangy
saltiness
that
really
blends
well
with
the
funkiness
and
sour
it
reminds
me
slightly
of
sprinkling
salt
on
crab
apples
when
i
was
a
kid
to
make
the
sour
and
tannic
flavors
more
palatable
their
is
a
nice
soft
funkiness
upfront
and
some
mellow
sourness
throughout
there
is
a
bit
off
butterscotch
here
as
well
and
a
nice
jolt
of
tannins
in
the
finish
complex
intriguing
and
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
tannic
i
really
enjoyed
this
on
tap
but
havent
tried
it
from
a
bottle
yet
my
second
pour
of
this
is
a
touch
more
yeasty
which
seems
to
soften
the
tartness
a
bit
and
also
adds
some
raw
fermented
dough
notes
though
only
just
a
touch
as
well
as
enhancing
a
cooked
bread
like
character
sour
dough
to
be
sure
though
i
easily
polish
off
this
750ml
bottle
though
there
is
enough
acidity
to
make
my
empty
stomach
feel
a
bit
rumbly
worthy
of
the
hype
that
i
built
up
in
my
mind
i
dont
know
but
it
is
definitely
worth
the
hype
to
try
it
it
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
as
a
beer
like
this
could
always
use
a
lively
carbonation
in
my
book
notes
drank
far
too
many
of
these
on
tap
at
toronados
21st
anniversary
party
great
stuff
split
a
bottle
with
overlord
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
fairly
good
white
head
smelled
of
sour
fruit
funky
horse
manure
and
yeast
taste
was
a
complex
balance
of
sour
and
funky
funky
yeast
a
truly
great
beer
that
unfortunately
is
hard
to
get
bottle
sampled
at
lost
abbey
for
rbsg
pours
hazy
gold
with
visible
sediment
head
is
modest
and
watery
aroma
is
very
tart
with
red
and
dark
fruits
oak
and
spicy
sweetbread
epic
complexity
flavors
of
pie
spices
yeast
lemons
vanilla
apple
brandy
and
some
funky
must
palate
is
dry
even
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
considering
the
tartness
tried
batch
two
of
this
seemed
like
more
funkoak
less
complexity
i
think
the
first
batch
was
much
better
and
given
that
tomme
informed
me
iirc
that
the
original
recipe
was
not
retained
i
cant
help
but
think
the
second
batch
was
an
approximation
good
to
see
that
batch
2
is
holding
up
fine
and
could
age
a
bit
longer
i
will
keep
my
bottle
for
as
long
as
i
can
and
see
what
happens
d
i
almost
passed
out
when
carl
pulled
this
one
out
of
his
cooler
it
is
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sour
ales
that
youll
come
across
golden
with
a
small
white
head
minimal
but
nice
lacing
aromas
are
super
funky
sour
barnyard
like
beatification
on
crack
super
sour
almost
bile
like
with
a
wonderful
wild
and
wiley
yeast
portfolio
light
buttery
and
wine
like
not
unlike
a
smooth
cantillon
gueuze
probably
the
best
gueuze
like
wild
ale
ever
produced
by
an
american
brewer
drinkability
a
very
fine
beer
im
quite
pleased
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
chewy
full
of
candy
orange
funk
with
a
dryness
covering
the
palate
with
citrusy
zest
drinkability
this
beer
certainly
lived
up
to
all
the
hype
that
surrounds
it
i
feel
lucky
to
have
quaffed
it
with
other
knowledgable
advocates
of
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sours
this
is
your
nirvana
seek
it
out
at
all
costs
and
please
share
some
with
me
a
bombshell
of
a
beer
while
i
am
hesitant
to
give
this
beer
all
fives
i
do
not
think
there
are
others
out
there
that
will
match
its
complexity
and
well
rounded
aromasflavorsmouthfeels
each
area
is
like
a
yinyang
of
soursweet
soursoft
fruityspicy
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
other
beers
that
can
present
themselves
as
superb
one
dimensional
beers
but
not
all
encompassing
i
would
consume
this
beer
with
any
meal
and
feel
confident
that
it
would
pair
well
im
eager
to
try
it
again
i
want
the
remaining
99
bottles
cheers
drinkability
damn
i
hope
they
decide
to
bottle
this
probably
the
winner
of
the
night
for
me
one
of
the
best
sour
beers
i
have
ever
had
on
draft
at
toronados
bday
color
of
hazy
mango
with
a
thin
eggshell
colored
head
nose
of
apricots

hey
everyone
heres
a
beer
at
the
top
of
the
list
on
beeradvocate
lets
travel
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
get
a
taste
then
race
to
the
site
to
pine
over
how
amazing
this
is
is
this
a
bad
beer
of
course
not
is
this
gods
gift
to
beer
get
real
do
yourself
a
favor
head
to
your
local
distributor
and
get
your
favorite
middle
range
beer
youll
be
exactly
the
same
off
funky
goodness
and
the
bottle
version
is
certainly
funkier
than
on
tap
eh
maybe
too
funky
for
me
but
this
is
a
very
unique
and
complex
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
wild
is
an
understatement
this
is
a
safari
in
a
bottle
hype
doesnt
do
it
justice
overall
the
strength
of
this
beer
is
in
its
balance
and
its
ability
to
change
from
tart
lambic
to
estery
belgian
to
dry
saison
with
a
simple
swirl
of
the
glass
not
showy
or
flashy
just
simply
well
made
one
dimensional
and
just
a
little
boring
after
several
trys
over
the
years
i
was
hoping
this
would
click
but
it
never
has
i
have
never
gotten
much
yeast
or
substantial
tartness
out
of
this
dont
know
why
my
experience
is
that
much
different
than
most
others
though
i
think
there
are
much
better
wild
ale
available
and
ones
that
are
so
much
easier
to
get
as
well
this
was
absolutely
unreal
best
balance
and
mouthfeel
ive
ever
had
i
love
stouts
this
one
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
2009
vintage
nice
level
of
acidity
but
somewhat
one
dimensional
still
tasty
o
excellent
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
thanks

upfront

by

has
just
a
touch
of
white

it
cherry
skin
and
just
a
breath
of
funk
on
the
finish
doesnt
carry
the
funk
of
something
like
3f
oude
gueuze
and
doesnt
have
the
sourness
of
a
beer
like
cable
car
but
its
fantastically
rounded
and
just
keeps
pummeling
you
with
a
variety
of
flavors
none
of
them
bad
an
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
o
a
very
delicious
brew
perfectly
balanced
between
sour
and
sweet
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
absolutely
perfect
gueze
had
next
to
v010
and
v013
and
it
was
memorable
no
fruit
but
just
amazing
intense
sour
moderate
funk
not
over
carbed
a
pleasure
to
savor
slowly
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
type
of
brew
having
said
that
this
is
a
true
gem
and
my

says
it
all
reviewed
from

is
a

that
retains
nicely
nose
starts
with
acid
and
funk
heavy
notes
of
lemon

green

and
funky
notes
of
hay
and
farm
the
taste
is
moderately
tart
with
a
nice
layer
of
funky
complexity
notes
of
oak
come
in
and
play
nicely
with
the
funk
qualities
reminds
me
of
an
authentic
belgian
gueuze
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
light
overall
a
very
tasty
american
take
on
a
gueuze
overall
this
must
be
a
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
develops
in
the
bottle
as
of
how
2013
ddg
is
drinking
i
just
dont
understand
all
the
fanfare
surrounding
this
lost
abbey
sour
not
much
complexity
and
it
doesnt
really
impress
me
all
that
much
overall
really
well
balanced
absolutely
delicious
gueuzestyle
beer
here
the
wine
barrels
come
out
nice
and
strong
but
do
not
dominate
well
integrated
flavors
with
a
nice
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
a
wonderful
beer
here

overall
fantastic
beer
from
lost
abbey
and
i
am
so
glad
i
was
able
to
track
this
one
down
well
worth
the
wait
and
definitely
one
of
my
long
time
wants
i
really
was
close
to
a
5
on
this
beer
its
definitely
in
my
top
5
and
left
me
craving
desperately
for
another
on
the
whole
what
truly
impressed
me
about
ddg
was
its
ability
to
present
a
bevy
of
delicious
flavor
profiles
that
managed
to
be
at
once
distinct
unto
themselves
as
well
as
graceful
partners
to
the
other
notes
present
in
the
beer
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
that
im
incredibly
grateful
to
have
gotten
to
try
o
this
beer
is
awesome
i
dont
think
that
its
worth
the
fuss
but
well
worth
seeking
out
and
trying

my
absolute
favorite

to
date
very
sour
but
it
balances
out
perfectly
with
the
other

there
is
a
lot
of
depth
in
this
ale
and
is
if
fun
to
sip
and
play
with
the
flavors
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
and
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
awesome
job
by
tomme
and
the
crew
at
lost

you
want
a
good
no
great
beer
go
get
yourself
a
weyerbacher
riserva
now
thats
a
great
sour
barrel
aged
beer
bottom
line
this
was
fucking
terrible
good
thing
i
only
wasted
7
on
it
never
understand
how
these
kinds
of
beers
get
ratings
around
here
overall
an
excellent
american
wild
ale
youll
never
mistake
this
for
a
gueuze
as
the
name
might
lead
you
to
believe
but
this
is
still
a
excellent
beer
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
has
an
orangeyellow
pour
with
a
medium
white
head
it
is
a
fruity
beer
with
a
slight
acidity
to
it
aromas
of
this
beer
include
lemon
and
citrus
flavors
of
lemons
and
citrus
come
through
when
tasting
sour
aftertaste
with
a
light
body
not
my
favorite
hazy
lemon
yellow
in
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
and
spotty
lacing
the
nose
features
light
lactic
funk
hay
tart
lemon
barnyard
and
a
light
grassy
note
graceful
layered
flavor
of
sour
citrus
lemon
meringue
slight
orange
and
melon
with
a
tart
finish
that
doesnt
overpower
the
wellbalanced
taste
effervescent
and
slightly
prickly
palate
o
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
complex
american
wild
ales
that
ill
ever
have
the
chance
to
try
it
does
seem
to
fade
in
the
nose
and
flavour
as
it
warms
up
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
a
lot
i
believe
people
when
they
say
this
and
beatification
are
better
than
cable
car
and
im
very
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
a
good
onethird
of
a
750ml
bottle
of
this
to
dissect
and
enjoy
its
certainly
not
an
armand4
geuze
but
as
far
as
american
wilds
go
this
is
excellent
have
had
this
several
times
now
and
im
able
to
appreciate
it
more
than
i
first
did
when
i
sampled
it
with
some
friends
in
dc
years
ago
but
this
still
is
just
too
much
sour
for
my
palate
to
handle
that
being
said
this
is
always
a
fun
and
interesting
beer
to
sample
and
its
amazing
the
amount
of
flavor
it
delivers
o
awesome
flavor
stellar
balance
surprisingly
smooth
and
possibly
the
best
finish
of
any
beer
ive
ever
had
truly
world
class
given
the
hype
surrounding
this
beer
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
more
unique
and
complex
nevertheless
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
well
crafted
american
wild
ale
that
i
am
grateful
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
big
thanks
again
to
my
friend
sean
for
sharing
this
overall
this
was
a
lot
of
fun
putting
the
13
and
the
09
beside
each
other
really
showed
the
superiority
of
the
older
vintage
the
newer
13
is
still
too
young
as
its
a
bit
harsh
with
too
much
acidity
in
the
way
of
the
flavors
the
09
however
has
matured
nicely
and
reminds
me
of
some
aged
gueuze
here
in
belgium
a
soft
integrated
and
refined
sour
that
was
very
much
enjoyed
all
around
not
to
offend
the
newer
bottling
but
most
people
at
the
tasting
agreed
the
older
vintage
was
superior
i
certainly
would
have
scored
it
a
4
thanks
again
for
bringing
this
pair
along
lots
of
fun
man
2013
vintage
a
beer
thats
been
high
on
my
list
and
everyone
elses
for
what
seems
like
forever
hazy
pale
yellow
in
color
it
definitely
looks
the
part
under
a
fizzy
pure
white
head
that
dies
down
right
away
the
nose
on
this
is
just
incredible
its
so
so
sour
citric
lemon
acidity
at
first
followed
by
a
relaxed
bacterial
farmhouse
saison
mustiness
and
a
mellowing
oak
aspect
white
wheat
malt
is
not
sufficient
to
balance
the
sour
and
its
not
really
supposed
to
be
tartness
all
the
way
in
the
smell
and
my
eyes
almost
water
from
the
intensity
of
it
all
the
taste
starts
out
just
like
the
nose
with
more
of
a
lemon
than
a
bacterial
vibe
but
the
drying
sourness
comes
in
hot
and
aided
by
the
carbonation
almost
hurts
the
palate
certainly
the
jawline
the
oak
is
big
here
and
it
needs
to
be
it
gives
more
depth
and
body
than
the
malt
does
seemingly
my
one
critique
of
this
is
in
the
feel
while
it
has
awesome
carbonation
it
does
have
some
residual
sugar
that
keeps
this
drinking
a
little
heavier
and
far
less
dry
and
clean
than
the
classic
gueuzes
of
belgium
maybe
this
is
to
do
with
the
blending
maybe
it
needs
more
time
im
not
sure
but
the
finish
in
terms
of
feel
is
off
more
vinegary
sourness
than
lactic
i
like
it
a
lot
and
i
am
stoked
to
have
finally
tried
it
but
im
not
sure
i
would
put
it
in
the
top
25
beers
in
the
world
as
others
have
flavor
is
where
this
brew
takes
the
cake
especially
as
it
warms
starts
off
with
amazing
green
apple
tartness
and
sweetness
but
mostly
welcoming
tartness
huge
yet
not
overwhelming
puckering
tartness
starts
things
off
along
with
dryness
and
woody
funk
notes
the
brew
is
pretty
musty
and
dry
with
a
perfect
balance
between
the
tartness
and
the
funk
amazing
tasting
sourness
that
isnt
overwhelming
with
a
great
crisp
clean
and
fluffy
body
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
had
out
there
it
is
clean
and
not
too
overwhelming
but
has
some
amazing
fruit
tartness
balanced
by
some
nice
fruit
sweetness
overall
my
new
favorite
gueze
d
i
think
this
is
easily
more
balanced
than
beat
pretty
on
par
for
complexity
and
more
accessible
for
someone
not
looking
for
stomachchurning
sourness
easy
recommendation
a
near
perfect
beer
but
splitting
hairs
i
e
hows
hotter
megan
fox
or
kate
upton
had
it
via
taster
and
bottle
although
i
feel
the
bottle
was
better
than
what
was
poured
from
the
tap
this
is
probably
the
best
wild
ale
or
technically
a
geueze
but
really
not
a
geuze
bc
not
in
belgium
yes
theres
a
lot
of
hype
with
ddg
but
well
deserved
would
i
pimp
slap
an
angry
football
player
for
seconds
yes
i
would
now
the
review
carbonation
is
perfect
and
a
very
clean
mouthfeel
tasty
as
hell
with
a
long
and
the
right
amount
of
sour
finish
very
well
composed
and
should
improve
with
age
which
is
scary
to
think
of
its
potential
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
sank
to
a
ringlet
leaving
some
spots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
champagnelike
carbonation
bubbling
from
the
glass
bottom
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
mainly
funkadelics
earthy
bretty
aromas
of
horseblanket
lemon
zest
and
apple
peel
leaving
no
doubt
that
this
will
have
some
sourness
to
it
very
acidic
on
the
palate
almost
too
much
actually
nearly
wrecking
after
adjusting
for
a
moment
or
two
out
come
flavors
of
acidic
citrus
and
sour
stone
fruits
lemon
drops
lesser
notes
of
earthy
funk
horseblanket
distant
crackery
malts
dry
and
crisp
mouthfeel
medium
body
andif
you
conquer
that
initial
blast
of
palatewrecking
aciditya
pretty
easy
drinker
for
the
style
pretty
good
overall
but
not
worth
trading
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
a
refreshing
compelling
ale
but
not
as
wellrounded
as
the
first
release
and
not
as
good
as
the
hype
or
the
price
would
lead
you
to
think
there
are
plenty
of
other
sour
brews
with
more
depth
and
complexity
this
probably
could
use
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
as
well
worth
the
hype
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
night
whenever
a
personal
whale
is
slain
and
you
get
to
keep
your
money
is
a
wonderful
day
overall
this
is
world
class
period
the
balance
present
in
this
is
what
makes
it
so
phenomenal
im
a
fan
of
bold
flavors
balance
and
drinkability
in
any
beer
style
this
is
the
epitome
of
those
three
descriptors
summed
up
in
the
american
wild
ale
style
this
is
ready
to
drink
now
now
more
sourness
may
appeal
to
some
but
not
me
the
bottle
is
almost
done
all
by
myself
in
less
than
an
hr
and
a
half
im
in
love
o
admittedly
i
am
lost
abbey
fanboy
however
i
dont
hesitate
to
criticize
them
when
they
fuck
up
they
do
fuck
up
a
lot
but
when
tomme
gets
his
shit
together
they
are
100
fucking
all
time
this
beer
would
be
an
example
of
being
100
fucking
all
time
like
an
otter
pop
blended
with
lemon
juice
filtered
through
sweaty
gym
socks
and
yeah
that
was
intended
to
be
a
compliment
oda
huge
treat
to
be
able
to
try
this
beer
i
was
not
blown
away
but
it
is
clearly
a
great
wild
ale
this
one
is
a
bit
over
hyped
still
not
much
else
to
complain
about
o
i
was
skeptical
on
how
great
this
wild
ale
offering
could
be
even
with
all
the
hype
but
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
while
i
was
intent
on
writing
off
this
acquisition
as
foolish
internet
purchasing
debacle
road
trip
to
san
diego
etc
i
am
content
in
saying
it
was
worth
it
its
definitely
one
of
the
more
stronger
wild
ales
ive
enjoyed
yet
i
cant
wait
to
age
this
a
bit
and
hopefully
mute
out
some
of
the
acidity
that
is
present
go
little
bottle
yeast
ducklings
go
id
like
to
age
this
and
drink
all
my
bottles
now
i
wish
this
was
more
available
quite
delicious
o
i
love
this
beer
but
im
hesitant
on
opening
a
bottle
now
when
i
do
ill
be
revisiting
this
review
d
this
is
exceptionally
drinkable
despite
the
incredible
acidity
and
if
you
cant
handle
it
work
your
jaws
up
with
some
petrus
and
take
your
complaints
elsewhere
the
price
and
availability
of
this
is
a
complete
testicle
and
wallet
defacement
that
makes
me
longing
for
more
some
will
take
calm
refuge
and
say
that
3f
oude
gueuze
is
better
denial
is
a
hella
of
a
panacea
this
is
an
almost
perfect
awa
in
every
way
it
is
not
a
gueuze
but
it
goes
beyond
even
traditional
goozies
in
sheer
excess
and
panache
like
an
acidic
zr1
that
pushes
you
down
in
your
seat
with
sheet
acidic
stiff
arming
fucking
phenomenal
every
bit
as
good
as
b1
that
will
continue
to
improve
despite
the
1
0001
fg
mark
my
words
o
this
beer
is
an
exercise
in
balance
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
plays
well
with
the
flavor
that
plays
well
with
the
crisp
finish
it
was
a
great
beer
to
have
when
standing
around
with
a
few
hundred
other
whale
hunters
in
a
90
degree
plus
warehouse
sweating
as
far
as
other
sour
beers
out
there
this
one
is
mild
is
this
beer
worth
the
whale
status
no
but
is
a
really
good
beer
none
the
less
recommended
o
this
is
a
solid
american
wild
ale
that
goes
up
there
with
some
of
the
belgians
ive
had
it
definitely
was
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
had
as
it
was
rather
tart
with
just
enough
funk
and
complexity
to
keep
it
grounded
and
interesting
i
was
warned
this
beer
had
fallen
off
a
bit
i
can
assure
you
it
was
the
shocker
of
the
night
for
the
people
that
have
had
it
already
it
was
unanimous
that
this
was
the
best
bottle
of
ddg
they
have
ever
had
for
me
the
amazing
balance
of
sourfunklemon
zest
was
amazing
aint
over
the
hill
yet
son
cost
40
for
a
750
ml
bottle
overall
extremely
sour
and
it
probably
covers
up
any
complexity
thankfully
the
flavors
it
has
are
quite
good
overall
i
have
heard
many
people
say
that
this
beer
is
turning
into
acid
but
perhaps
their
techniques
in
storing
has
been
an
issue
with
their
bottle
this
bottle
tasted
like
it
was
about
2
years
old
if
you
have
stored
your
correctly
i
think
you
have
another
23
years
before
it
goes
bad
i
wish
i
would
have
had
this
news
prior
to
me
opening
my
only
bottle
but
i
am
very
glad
to
have
had
this
delicious
brew
8
810
o
overall
this
was
an
exceptional
bottle
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
little

the

hint
of
lemon
rhind
mixed
with
sour
berries
this
was
surprisingly
dry
on
the
palate
smooth
from
sip
to

overall
this
is
an
amazing
geuze
bottle
shared
by

has
lots

medium

a
very
good
hybrid

the

leaves
you
begging

was
everybit

reminds
me
of
cable
car
though
i
prefer
the
blend
of
flavors
here
an
excellent
american
sour
overall
fanfreakintastic
amazing
gueuze
with
great
blend
of
sour
fruit
juice
tart
almost
fresh
fruit
flavors
some
funk
and
plenty
of
acidity
and
a
light
typical
bready
malt
finish
nice
and
dry
and
all
in
all
fairly
drinkable
surprisingly
really
wish
i
could
have
gotten
more
of
this
to
at
least
have
another
one
in
the
cellar
the
only
real
issue
is
lack
of
carbonation
and
a
few
year
old
beer
and
being
a
lost
abbey
beer
in
the
time
of
tomme
arthur
carbonation
issues
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
still
pretty
good
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
american
wild
but
i
was
expecting
a
gueuze
i
know
its
listed
as
a
wild
but
the
name
made
me
thin
gueuze
i
still
liked
it
and
would
have
more
o
just
a
fantastic
beer
glad
we
got
to
readd
this
one
clean
despite
being
funky
boom
golden
honey
blonde
with
swirls
of
haze
from
the
yeast
nice
bubbly
top
beautiful
blend
of
lemon
zest
herbs
tannic
wood
and
must
with
lots
of
citric
and
lactic
sourness
radiating
all
over
the
place
very
light
sweetness
throughout
light
in
body
with
an
effervescent
carbonation
that
is
neither
too
strong
nor
too
weak
quite
a
delicious
beer
indeed
verdict
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
and
deservedly
has
a
reputation
as
being
one
i
really
cant
think
of
anything
to
change
about
this
beer
and
my
wishing
for
more
head
might
be
out
of
line
my
hats
off
to
tomme
for
this
a
true
gem
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
amazing
wild
ale
one
of
the
best
at
the
tasing
for
me
and
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
the
nose
is
perfect
and
just
a
ton
of
sourness
and
funk
well
worth
the
hype
and
really
hoping
the
rumors
are
true
that
they
are
making
this
one
again
i
preferred
it
to
both
synergy
and
yellow
bus
though
izzy
slightly
edged
this
one
out
for
me
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
had
a
ton
of
flavor
but
it
was
much
easier
to
drink
than
some
of
the
other
wilds
i
have
had
i
would
have
loved
to
have
tried
this
one
fresh
when
it
came
out
o
as
far
as
most
american
wilds
go
this
is
far
and
away
something
well
made
however
when
pitted
against
the
cream
of
the
crop
it
at
least
at
this
stage
in
its
aging
falls
very
short
of
pure
greatness
i
really
dug
the
clean
sourness
unlike
the
harsh
overbacterialized
sours
so
many
breweries
are
rushing
through
production
anymore
overall
really
great
beer
probably
the
most
sour
beer
ive
had
besides
hanssens
not
much
funk
but
its
great
with
the
fresh
peach
flavor
and
honey
the
taste
is
really
delicious
the
sour
is
balanced
with
sweetness
and
complex
with
wood
and
depth
of
flavor
drink
well
the
journey
is
complete
i
have
my
white
wale
and
i
finally
got
to
give
my
little
girl
the
bottle
for
those
of
you
who
know
the
story
you
know
how
much
this
means
to
me
the
moment
the
beer
the
people
it
was
perfect
thank
you
again
chris
i
owe
you
big
time
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
extremely
sour
and
funky
with
lemonlike
fruits
and
some
earthy
aromas
taste
is
of
extremely
sour
lemons
and
funky
earthy
flavors
a
very
acidic
quality
in
the
mouth
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
carbonation
level
with
a
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
extremely
awesome
wild
ale
with
some
amazing
smells
and
flavors
i
feel
very
lucky
to
have
tried
this
one
o
ill
be
honest
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
and
it
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
definitely
worth
seeking
out
but
im
not
too
crazy
about
it
i
would
like
to
give
it
another
try
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
gueuzes
out
there
that
are
readily
more
available
and
taste
better
i
think
the
big
thing
for
me
is
that
this
is
more
mellow
that
a
lot
of
other
ones
in
this
style
maybe
it
needs
a
bit
more
age
but
only
time
will
tell
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
this
has
been
on
my
top
wants
for
some
time
love
the
acidity
and
the
fruity
notes
that
come
out
would
love
to
have
another
opportunity
to
drink
this
beer
i
have
had
this
5
or
so
times
now
and
have
loved
it
every
time
not
the
most
complex
stuff
no
real
depth
of
funk
but
again
the
fresh
fruit
character
they
manage
to
evoke
in
beers
like
this
isabelle
and
cable
car
is
always
impressive
overall
an
amazing
beer
definitely
the
best
american
wild
ale
ive
ever
had
still
has
plenty
of
body
and
i
honestly
dont
even
think
its
peeked
yet
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
a
slight
ring
and
swirls
of
haze
phenomenal
aromas
of
funk
lemon
juice
oak
green
granny
smith
apples
and
wet
hay
very
acidic
and
sharp
but
in
the
best
possible
way
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
cable
car
taste
follow
the
nose
nicely
very
acidic
flavors
of
lemon
juice
green
apple
and
tropical
fruit
with
a
bit
of
oak
and
a
whole
lot
of
funk
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
fairly
light
body
and
good
sharp
carbonation
just
the
right
amount
of
dry
sourness
here
it
doesnt
strip
the
enamel
off
your
teeth
overall
an
amazing
unforgettable
beer
so
stoked
to
have
gotten
to
try
this

light

the
earthy

is
there
with
some
barrel

hints

the

is
sour
extremely
high

burns
the

i
didnt
really
expect

great
flavor
profiles
i
dont
know
if
ill

get
the
chance
to
try
this
again
but
i
can
cross
my
fingers
and
hope
o
a
very
good
wild
ale
with
a
good
degree
of
tartness
but
not
enough
that
it
becomes
undrinkable
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
as
a
very
cleantasting
sour
thanks

bryan
overall

a

clean

a
fantastic
beer
this
beer
is
a
very
pale
hazy

yellow
with
a
very
slight
ring
of
egg
shell
foam
the
beer
smells
wild
and
bretty
with
a
little
fresh
lemon
the
beer
starts
out
pleasantly
sour
and
tart
with
good
lemon
and
green
apple
flavors
but
the
finish
is
pure
viengar
the
viscous
mouthcoating
salivastripping
mouth
pucker
acidity
it
is
a
combination
of
astrigent
like
biting
into
underripe
apples
and
vinegar
was
very
unappealing
this
beer
is
wildly
drying
for
a
liquid
this
is
an
okay
beer
not
the
worst
sour
ive
ever
had
but
it
does
not
live
up
to
the
hype
at
all
im
glad
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
but
its
nothing
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
o
a
wonderful
beer
which
ive
been
iso
for
what
seems
like
forever
perfect
tart
lemon
characteristics
with
a
level
of
funkiness
that
leaves
me
craving
another
glass
pours
similar
to
carbonated
apple
juice
with
not
quite
the
clarity
and
a
nice
cap
of
white
head
the
nose
is
lightly
sour
with
lemon
rind
and
cider
vinegar
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
expected
a
lemon
apple
acidity
presents
in
a
somewhat
reserved
way
this
beer
is
shockingly
drinkable
and
not
particularly
sour
more
funky
than
sour
one
of
my
preferred
wilds
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
good
strong
carbonation
and
a
heavier
than
expected
body
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
wilds
that
i
have
had
from
the
nebulous
awa
style
d
very
drinkable
the
front
is
more
tart
while
the
tail
is
funkier
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
yellowed
orange
with
a
nice
touch
of
white
head
got
the
dregs
sort
of
of
the
bottle
smells
tart
and
sour
very
nicely
funky
its
very
sour
but
also
very
funky
not
like
any
beer
ive
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
well
carbonated
the
sourness
is
pretty
harsh
but
enjoyable
definitely
a
very
solid
beer
somewhere
between
a
gueuze
and
a
wild
huge

is
very
high
especially
for
this

amazing
beer
i
would
definitely
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
cable
car
to
see
which
one
i
enjoy
more
gfunk
overall
a
wonderful
beer
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
now
and
have
one
to
open
later
rip
on
la
or
ta
as
much
as
you
want
but
he
can
make
some
damn
good
sours
simply
put
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
the
first
beer
of
the
night
and
the
best
in
my
opinion
fantastic
foggy
strawcolored
pour
with
minimal
white
head
nose
is
vinegary
and
acetic
but
with
a
very
noticeable
maltiness
backed
up
by
some
wonderful
cheesy
funk
flavor
is
quite
nicely
consistent
with
the
nose
like
the
nose
there
is
a
light
bready
sweetness
that
i
was
not
expecting
adequate
carbonation
pulls
everything
off
the
palate
for
a
great
finish

big
thanks
goes

to

a
half

pure

that
subsided
to
a

quickly
maintained

was

the

was
of

this

was
dropkick
your

just
the

i
like
it
the
fruit
character
in
this

tries
despirately
to
subdue
the
sourtart
aspect
going
on
here
but
it
never
stood
a
chance
funk
too
hell
yeah
this
brew
really
lived
up
to
my
expectations
and
might
have
actually
exceeded
them

definitely
a

thanks
to
one
of
you
i
came
into
this
expecting
a
gueuze
and
i
will
review
it
as
such
bright
orange
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
but
it
is
carbonated
smells
sour
and
a
bit
cheesy
but
i
would
not
say
funky
at
all
in
fact
this
does
not
smell
like
a
true
gueuze
at
all
the
taste
was
way
too
sweet
and
then
followed
by
a
sourness
the
sweetness
was
almost
like
a
pixie
stick
or
sweet
tart
and
i
didnt
like
that
aspect
at
all
there
was
some
citrus
and
fruit
but
to
call
this
a
gueuze
is
just
not
being
honest
as
a
wild
ale
this
was
ok
but
the
price
was
completely
out
of
line
for
the
beer
that
is
in
the
bottle
save
your
money
and
get
a
cantillon
for
half
the
price
really
amazing
beer
without
doubt
one
of
the
best
most
drinkable
and
complex
sours
ive
tried
and
ive
had
my
share
cloudy
honey
pour
with
an
amazing
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
style
producing
a
14
inch
ivory
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
aroma
of
peaches
balsamic
citrus
rind
and
grapes
flavor
doesnt
show
the
typical
barnyard
qualities
instead
combining
tart
sweet
and
fruitiness
green
apple
jolly
ranchers
lemongrass
apricot
and
grapefruit
balanced
and
incredible
d
just
an
absolute
beer
i
would
have
a
hard
time
placing
it
in
a
category
though
not
a
true
awa
just
a
wonderfully
easy
drinking
balanced
and
dynamic
beer
lost
abbey
has
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
i
really
think
this
is
hands
down
their
best
offering
im
going
to
have
to
get
more
one
of
my
favorite
beers
bravo
tomme
bravo
o
a
very
nice
brew
i
am
glad
i
had
it
i
would
not
consider
it
as
good
as
ip
deviation
ff
or
bottleworks
x
to
namedrop
a
few
ive
had
recently
but
it
is
quite
nice
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
likes
their
sours
though
but
cantillon
classic
gueze
is
like
16
and
this
is
50
cant
say
it
comes
anywhere
near
being
worth
it
based
on
that
comparison
but
should
have
it
at
least
once
in
a
blue
moon
i
e
when
you
see
it
o
really
tart
pretty
much
perfect
in
the
taste
and
smell
sector
we
had
a
lot
great
sours
at
this
tasting
and
this
was
my
top
pick
for
winner
i
really
really
need
to
get
a
bottle
for
myself
well
that
was
nice
d
a
really
enjoyable
and
wellcrafted
wild
ale
but
not
quite
as
strong
as
isabelle
or
cable
car
09
still
highly
recommended
and
well
worth
seeking
out
i
understand
that
isabelle
would
be
logistically
impossible
to
recreate
and
that
cable
car
is
solely
for
toronado
but
theres
no
good
reason
why
tomme
shouldnt
be
blending
up
more
of
this
every
year
well
it
was
wonderful
to
finally
be
able
to
sample
this
iconic
beer
from
the
lost
abbey
i
tried
going
into
this
blinded
but
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
my
experience
seemed
to
differ
smarties
candy
no
way
not
enough
sweetness
or
fruitiness
which
i
expected
a
lot
of
this
beer
is
definitely
one
to
try
worth
a
world
class
rating
ehhh
o
one
of
my
favorite
american
wilds
really
cant
get
enough
of
this
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
not
detectable
even
at
a
robust
7
for
the
style
highly
recommended
and
i
want
more
d
i
will
without
a
doubt
be
seeking
out
another
bottle
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
with
its
tangy
acidity
and
drying
quality
on
the
tongue
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
into
this
brew
it
just
works
each
sip
has
a
big
salivation
factor
to
it
which
urged
me
to
drink
more
almost
carelessly
without
thinking
about
the
characteristics
it
was
offering
the
only
thing
i
can
fault
this
beer
for
is
its
lack
of
availability
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
d
the
hanging
citrus
vinegar
is
going
to
fade
my
palate
quickly
as
my
throat
is
already
filled
with
super
tart
lemony
vinegar
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
nice
golden
color
quite
clear
and
bubbly
quality
head
super
citrusy
sour
with
a
nice
funk
and
malt
presence
strong
work
arthur
right
up
there
with
3f
and
cantillon
could
enjoy
this
beer
anytime
near
perfect
the
flavors
are
citrusy
with
orange
and
lemonade
puckering
taste
yet
there
is
a
light
dry
taste
w
mild
wood
and
gentle
lactic
accents
the
taste
of
the
wood
gives
a
dry
flavor
with
light
lemony
acidity
following
and
subtle
oak
w
hints
of
white
grape
combine
to
give
a
mild
astringent
edge
to
the
smooth
malt
and
fruit
from
the
yeast
the
green
grape
and
hints
of
bitter
citrus
blend
with
the
tannic
flavor
from
the
wood
as
it
finishes
there
is
an
almost
peachy
floral
and
tropical
sweetness
in
the
background
which
is
very
pleasant
and
adds
to
the
complexity
of
the
barrel
to
offset
some
of
the
dry
elements
in
the
taste
duck
duck
gooze
is
as
good
as
i
remember
from
having
it
at
extreme
beer
fest
2
years
ago
it
may
even
be
better
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
complexity
and
wonderful
flavors
for
a
5
wild
ale
this
was
very
memorable
and
well
worth
the
effort
to
acquire
i
wood
seek
this
out
again
d
just
an
absolute
wonderful
wild
ale
it
really
is
even
better
than
what
i
remember
from
my
first
time
trying
it
with
a
much
larger
amount
to
critique
and
a
more
quiet
setting
to
enjoy
it
in
i
felt
that
this
deserves
an
even
better
rating
than
i
originally
gave
it
just
a
wonderfully
easy
drinking
balanced
and
dynamic
beer
lost
abbey
has
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
i
really
think
this
is
hands
down
their
best
offering
i
really
do
not
see
how
it
can
get
any
better
than
this
for
the
style
d
overall
a
true
master
piece
of
a
wild
ale
thanks
again
sweem
for
the
chance
to
sample
a
healthy
serving
of
this
epic
brew
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
yellow
color
and
is
surprisingly
clear
only
a
very
slight
haze
to
it
the
head
is
white
and
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
sour
with
hints
of
fruit
like
green
apple
also
detect
some
oak
the
taste
is
pretty
close
to
the
smell
it
has
that
lactic
sour
with
hints
of
fruit
a
little
funk
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
to
medium
side
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
sour
and
very
drinkable
d
this
is
hard
to
not
demolish
before
finishing
the
review
its
very
very
easy
drinking
for
as
sour
as
it
is
it
goes
down
so
well
id
be
willing
to
wager
sweem
regretted
sharing
it
o
another
great
beer
i
just
had
tonight
well
worth
it
drinkability
quite
good
though
more
in
line
with
a
younger
unblended
lambic
with
the
malt
sweetness
and
gentler
brett
character
this
has
to
be
the
most
labiclike
of
any
american
wild
ive
had
to
date
that
said
i
wouldnt
say
that
this
is
any
better
than
cantillon
or
girardin
gueuzes
both
of
which
being
far
more
accessible
db
a
very
smooth
and
balanced
flavor
compared
to
most
sours
i
have
had
before
the
microbes
in
the
beer
lend
so
many
nice
flavors
and
the
brewing
skill
put
into
this
helps
balance
it
into
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
and
most
drinkable
sours
ive
had
so
far
a
great
balance
of
fruit
and
funk
tastes
lets
hope
it
gets
released
again
d
my
second
favorite
la
beer
ive
had
to
date
behind
cable
car
a
very
very
good
beer
and
one
ive
been
wanting
to
try
for
a
long
time
thanks
again
jeff
d
oh
yeah
definitely
drinkable
i
was
at
the
release
and
should
have
bought
it
instead
of
the
flat
santas
little
helper
and
older
viscosity
but
i
wasnt
into
sours
then
so
what
did
i
know
d
very
high
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
easy
to
drink
great
flavors
hope
to
see
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
that
could
be
confused
with
the
real
thing
from
belgium
well
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
ddamn
nice
stuff
not
overly
tart
as
the
initial
sweetness
balances
this
but
enough
to
make
itself
known
overall
this
is
very
approachable
inviting
and
solid
sour
one
i
am
certainly
glad
to
have
had
an
opportunity
to
try
this
is
great
very
well
blended
and
very
refreshing
not
overly
sour
but
quite
sour
in
general
d
excellent
drinker
for
a
sour
very
nice
edit
this
beer
is
a
mess
as
of
april
2011
i
think
i
was
overrating
it
to
begin
with
compared
to
some
better
peaches
its
completely
onedimensional
and
has
a
really
flat
flavor
profile
acidity
has
taken
over
as
it
does
with
most
lost
abbey
light
sours
drinkabilityamazingly
drinkable
sour
beer
not
as
sour
as
some
beers
its
really
drinkable
this
is
a
very
drinkable
wild
the
sourness
is
starting
to
become
more
intense
which
makes
this
more
of
a
sipper
but
a
sipper
that
is
full
of
complexity
and
great
flavor
this
is
most
definitely
one
of
the
best
sour
beers
i
have
ever
had
especially
from
an
american
brewery
really
a
must
for
all
sour
heads
i
cant
wait
for
the
next
release
great
job
lost
abbey
bottle
pours
an
opaque
amber
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
strong
sour
notes
and
tart
fruit
in
the
nose
some
acetone
notes
as
well
but
very
minimal
light
mouthfeel
with
a
really
nice
blend
of
flavors
fairly
sour
but
not
so
much
that
it
leaves
you
puckering
lemon
and
straw
notes
the
acetone
notes
in
the
aroma
are
there
in
the
taste
as
well
but
again
very
minimal
finishes
dry
and
clean
good
lace
left
behind
of
the
glass
a
very
solid
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
some
wine
like
characteristics
not
sure
how
this
beer
really
gets
any
better
great
beer
sadly
ill
probably
never
taste
it
again
d
this
is
the
most
drinkable
wild
ale
i
have
ever
had
i
split
my
bomber
with
a
friend
and
i
am
kind
of
sad
that
i
didnt
just
drink
the
whole
bottle
pretty
insanely
drinkable
great
to
try
this
one
would
be
awesome
on
a
hot
summer
day
clear
golden
off
white
head
minimal
lacing
acetic
brett
lemon
apple
and
oak
up
front
acetic
bite
with
a
sharp
lemon
peel
very
bright
taste
light
body
medium
carbonation
slightly
tannic
and
dry
finish
i
never
had
it
fresh
but
from
other
reviews
it
seems
the
acetic
character
is
starting
to
take
over
ip
still
wins
in
complexity
this
lacks
depth
the
flavor
reveals
dry
grass
and
white
grape
rinds
the
gooze
is
sour
but
not
crushingly
so
tart
acidity
on
the
finish
does
well
to
numb
the
sides
of
the
tongue
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
a
crisp
carbonation
level
and
drying

and
very
tasty
all
in
all
a
great
americanmade
geuze
thanks
again
for
the
share
mike
this
is
one
great
brew
had
this
about
a
year
ago
and
it
has
changed
a
lot
hazy
urine
color
with
lively
carbonation
turbid
for
the
style
its
trying
to
mimic
aroma
is
acetone
highly
lactic
eggy
sweaty
goat
fur
i
didnt
get
much
brett
funk
this
one
just
smells
sour
taste
has
degraded
eggy
lactic
acidity
acetobacter
has
a
bigger
presence
im
getting
a
noticeable
amount
of
vinegar
that
is
hurting
its
flavor
and
drinkability
lemon
tartness
and
high
level
of
sourness
is
still
there
the
vanilla
sweetness
has
disappeared
or
being
overpowered
by
acidity
i
felt
this
used
to
be
a
really
good
beer
but
seems
like
it
has
peaked
id
love
it
if
an
american
wild
would
have
a
brett
character
you
didnt
have
to
search
through
tons
of
acidity
to
find
overall
duck
duck
gooze
has
some
wonderful
balance
and
is
not
as
intense
as
i
am
sure
it
was
coming
out
of
the
gates
a
year
ago
i
could
drink
this
for
days
pairing
it
occasionally
with
some
triple
cream
and
perhaps
apples
andor
apricots
drinks
thanks
to
an
epic
beer
tasting
lineup
i
was
able
to
enjoy
duck
duck
gooze
directly
after
isabelle
proximus
in
comparing
the
two
id
call
this
the
more
incomplete
beer
it
had
a
more
unique
flavor
bill
but
seemed
slightly
less
wellmingled
another
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
may
have
improved
it
a
bit
d
its
solid
but
not
worth
giving
up
the
farm
for
it
d
i
could
have
killed
the
bottle
with
great
ease
i
was
sad
to
see
the
bottom
of
my
glass
i
will
without
a
doubt
be
seeking
out
another
bottle
it
was
my
2nd
favorite
sour
of
the
night
only
beatification
out
shined
this
and
that
is
really
splitting
hairs
overall
a
real
treat
and
fantastic
beer
an
awesome
beer
and
well
worth
tracking
down
the
lead
off
flavor
is
a
strong
lactic
and
acidic
sourness
no
sweetness
at
all
i
was
expecting
some
funk
to
come
along
but
instead
there
is
almost
a
collapse
of
the
palate
close
to
the
back
no
tartness
in
the
corners
of
the
mouth
you
might
expect
with
other
usually
fruit
flavored
lambics
the
body
of
the
beer
is
pretty
thin
minimal
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
its
there
if
you
hold
the
beer
there
for
a
moment
it
begins
to
burn
around
the
gums
and
behind
the
lips
the
beer
is
very
sour
and
minimally
bitter
finishes
cleanly
probably
due
to
the
lack
of
back
palate
tart
and
funk
a
great
beer
overall
and
a
great
sour
thanks
again
matt
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
with
many
sours
is
a
little
lower
for
me
but
with
this
one
i
would
not
have
a
problem
finishing
the
bottle
overall
this
was
my
favorite
of
a
night
in
which
8
of
the
top
10
sours
were
consumed
i
only
wish
i
had
another
bottle
fantastic
skal
overall
another
fantastic
and
drinkable
sour
from
tomme
o
less
funky
but
more
fruity
than
deviation
part
one
of
the
sours
an
excellent
beer
good
balance
fruit
heavy
but
great
mild
funk
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
active
white
prickly
and
sprity
head
minimal
lacing
scent
is
musty
and
sour
finally
mellowing
into
a
slight
citrus
and
biscut
note
mild
vanilla
and
oak
first
sip
is
tart
funky
and
acidic
but
soon
rushed
into
a
very
fruity
blend
mango
apprico
lemon
pineapple
lots
of
stuff
going
on
there
slight
biscuty
sweetness
and
hints
of
the
vanilla
and
oak
also
present
medium
bodied
active
carbonation
dry
a
pleasure
to
sip
and
could
see
this
improving
over
a
long
length
of
time
coming
at
me
with
a
hazy
yellowish
blond
look
with
hints
of
orange
poking
around
in
there
looks
a
bit
lighter
than
medium
in
build
and
there
is
no
head
at
all
from
the
tap
no
lacing
smells
include
big
musk
of
barn
with
horse
and
hay
a
big
basket
of
lemons
and
assorted
fruits
oak
wood
and
some
musty
aroma
with
a
dousing
of
brett
maybe
lacto
smells
like
its
going
to
be
sour
and
it
is
a
nice
sour
gueuze
i
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
young
and
can
tell
its
only
growing
in
funk
taste
is
tart
lemon
drops
with
apricot
and
small
pineapple
blast
warming
brings
a
bit
of
apple
to
the
stage
in
the
middle
a
earthy
taste
with
oak
tannins
but
not
any
vanilla
which
is
ok
by
me
the
sourness
is
pleasant
and
a
bit
acidic
but
not
quite
there
yet
there
is
actually
a
nice
faint
sweetness
going
along
with
the
sour
in
that
order
puckering
yes
overly
puckering
no
quite
balanced
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbed
crisp
and
semi
dry
i
ll
take
another
please
id
like
to
see
where
this
goes
in
a
year
or
two
but
the
chances
of
getting
another
bottle
are
slim
another
winner
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
sours
ever
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
yet
still
incredibly
sour
and
complex
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
and
makes
me
want
to
find
a
way
to
get
a
case
of
ddg
d
i
love
sour
beers
and
this
one
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
that
has
a
great
sour
punch
and
great
flavor
to
back
it
up
i
really
hope
i
can
get
more
of
this
sour
elixer
a
really
delicious
beer
im
as
harsh
as
anyone
on
la
but
this
beer
is
fantastic
wish
i
had
more
of
it
d
like
most
sours
this
one
is
a
very
difficult
beer
to
consider
sessionable
i
love
sours
but
my
palate
always
feels
destroyed
after
finishing
a
bottle
still
i
cannot
put
this
one
down
d
this
beer
is
amazing
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
and
i
hope
i
will
be
able
to
get
my
hands
on
it
again
in
the
future
a
superb
drink
that
i
was
able
to
share
with
my
girlfriend
after
we
have
both
worked
looong
hour
for
many
days
making
the
setting
perfect
for
a
nice
sipper
to
be
savored
this
beer
is
something
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
and
more
sips
great
job
lost
abbey
i
look
forward
to
more
releases
overall
an
amazing
beer
cant
wait
till
it
comes
out
again
overall
an
amazing
beer
cant
wait
till
it
comes
out
again
this
is
another
excellent
sour
from
la
and
one
that
surely
stacks
up
against
some
of
the
best
out
there
american
or
belgian
super
drinkable
plenty
of
fruit
but
with
a
tagteam
combo
of
funk
and
lacticacetic
sourness
that
really
comes
together
well
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
absolutely
wonderful
ddefinitely
my
favorite
style
of
gueuze
what
i
think
of
as
a
clean
sour
other
beers
on
this
level
that
fit
in
this
made
up
character
of
mine
isabelle
proximus
flaming
fury
etc
drinkability
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
good
its
been
a
fairly
obvious
consensus
on
ba
for
quite
some
time
and
i
wasnt
let
down
in
the
least
supremely
drinkable
and
mega
enjoyable
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
lay
down
for
awhile
thanks
much
matt
very
acidic
and
mouth
puckering
the
sourness
makes
my
tongue
recoil
initially
very
light
and
enjoyable
with
that
nice
spritzy
feel
that
wilds
provide
so
readily
i
will
need
to
cleanse
my
palate
with
some
pecorino

lost
abbey
is
an
american
wild
ale
7
and
hard
to
get
a
hold
of
since
they
brew
it
in
very
small
quantities
its
a
blend
of
their
young
and
old
barrel
aged
beers
it
poured
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
hint
of
white
head
and
lacing
it
smelled
of
tart
citrus
sour
green
apples
oak
and
some
leather
notes
it
tasted
sharp
and
tart
at
first
with
some
lemon
peel
and
wood
then
it
finished
a
bit
sour
and
dry
but
very
well
balanced
d
as
i
said
split
the
bottle
with
one
other
person
and
it
was
not
too
heavy
nice
7
nor
did
its
taste
wane
the
beer
is
light
bodied
well
carbonated
very
tart
and
crisp
and
has
a
great
dry
finish
the
alcohol
is
never
present
the
sour
notes
take
it
to
the
limit
on
this
one
and
come
to
a
point
where
they
are
almost
too
harsh
but
they
never
get
there
this
is
a
very
good
wild
ale
something
i
cant
wait
to
revisit
tastes
just
like
it
smells
tart
up
front
oak
and
lemon
like
lemon
juice
the
second
wave
is
slightly
sweet
but
finishes
quickly
with
a
nice
dry
sourness
that
leaves
a
great
tart
long
lasting
aftertaste
wow
what
a
great
beer
light

to
high

d
this
is
a

that
i

love
to
drink
on
a
regular

it
is
loaded
with
complexities
and
quenches
my
thirst
at
the
same
time
d
definitely
a
sipping
beer
due
to
the
sour
while
it
does
leave
the
palate
feeling
stripped
i
could
literally
drink
this
all

this

this
beer
it
is
that
good
i
was
not
sure
if
i
would
get
to
try
it
and
im
certainly
glad
i
did
this
will
hopefully
not
be
my
last
time
with
this
beer
will
seek
out
a
trade
for
more
opaque
straw
colored
pour
with
a
small
loose
white
head
lactic
aroma
with
a
sweet
wheaty
malt
and
a
shot
of
fresh
squeezed
lemon
the
flavor
is
grainy
and
grassy
with
some
light
sweetness
straw
and
tart
lactic
finish
with
lots
of
lemon
zest
very
dry
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
i
loved
the
delicate
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
in
this
the
body
is
medium
and
there
is
a
bit
of
carbonation
sting
but
overall
it
is
pretty
much
what
i
expect
out
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
representative
of
the
style
and
one
that
is
easy
to
enjoy
and
also
provides
enough
complexity
for
deeper
examination
incredibly
impressive
for
any
american
brewery
to
construct
a
gueuze
like
this
never
bet
against
lost

more

really
nails

a
very
nice
level
of
carbonation
makes
this
brew
even
more
pleasing
to
the
palate
and
begs
for
another
sip
i
would
drink
a
bottle
of
this
every
week
or
so
if
i
had
a
couple
people
around
to
share
a
bottle
ddg
is
by
no
means
an
introductory
sour
but
the
flavor
really
isnt
too
intense
i
was
digging
the
aroma
much
more
having
said
that
this
beer
is
pretty
pretty
pretty
good
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
it
develops
with
a
little
time
d
i
think
this
has
gotta
be
the
poster
child
of
sours
it
doesnt
do
anything
outrageous
but
it
doesnt
fail
at
doing
anything
either
very
balanced
appropriate
smell
taste
and
feel
id
no
doubt
have
this
one
again
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
like
some
other
sours
ive
come
across
d
highly
drinkable
mmmm
i
have
a
feeling
that
if
i
werent
trying
to
get
a
review
out
of
the
tasting
amount
this
one
would
be
gone
pretty
quickly
though
the
sour
does
naturally
slow
you
down
slightly
drinkability
fantastic
i
kept
cleaning
my
palette
and
going
back
for
it
fresh
cause
that
first
kick
is
just
amazing
but
the
followup
that
is
once
your
palette
acclimates
reveals
whole
new
flourishes
and
subtleties
and
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
alone
and
though
that
price
is
steep
30
contributed
by
the
evergenerous
bankhead
this
one
is
a
true
treat
and
id
be
happy
to
pay
that
amount
for
this
one
again

that
were

and
a

mouthfeel
was
very
lively
and
consistent
throughout
finishes
dry
with
some
astringency
around
the
salivary
glands
this
was
extremely
delicious
and
even
quite
refreshing
and
palette
cleansing
even
with
the
incredible
fruit
profile
this
is
sour
but
not
puckeringly
so
one
of
the
most
memorable
beers
ive
yet
to
experience
i
know
its
classified
as
an
american
wild
but
definitely
some
gueze
like
qualities
i
guess
hence
the
name
m
d
this
was
one
of
two
sours
had
in
the
evening
and
it
brought
out
the
dryness
that
the
other
did
not
it
almost
lifts
off
the
tongue
love
it
this
one
steps
it
up
a
notch
as
far
as
geuze
goes
with
a
little
higher
alcohol
than
many
nonetheless
its
a
fabulous
sipping
sour
drinkability
very
sour
but
a
nice
flavor

and
good
mouthfeel
i
got
through
the
750ml
myself
and
wanted
more
d
very
nice
drinkability
to
this
one
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
strike
another
one
up
for
lost
abbey
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
i
would
not
pass
it
up
nb
i
enjoyed
this
one
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
but
it
simply
is
not
as
good
as
cable
car
isabelle
proximus
or
any
of
the
veritas
line
what
can
be
said
really
a
really
complex
guezestyle
beer
i
dont
know
how
they
pulled
it
off
but
id
have
been
shocked
if
you
told
me
this
wasnt
a
cantillon
or
similar

i
didnt

very

excellent
overall
this
is
an
excellent
ale
and
great
beer
overall
if
you
love
sours
this
is
one
you
have
to
search
out
highly
recommended
tastemouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
and
relatively
dry
an
initial
blast
of
sourness
makes
way
for
steady
tart
acidity
not
quite
as
sour
as
i
would
like
but
close
lactic
qualities
meld
with
oak
tannins
and
lemon
a
touch
of
green
apple
enters
into
play
as
does
a
hint
of
citrus
by
and
large
this
isnt
an
explosion
of
flavor
but
that
isnt
what
i
was
looking
for
this
is
a
well
crafted
sour
beer
that
makes
for
pleasant
easy
drinking
very
comparable
to
several
of
the
more
mellow
and
subdued
belgian
originals
well
done
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
this
was
all
in
all
pretty
intense
at
times
for
me
but
in
the
end
i
couldnt
ignore
the
beautiful
balance
between
the
tartness
sourness
funk
sweetness
and
barrel
flavors
just
a
fantastic
wild
ale
blend
here
a
beer
to
be
proud
of
for
sure
j
overall
i
have
been
waiting
to
open
up
this
beer
for
a
few
months
now
and
i
couldnt
think
of
any
better
time
than
thanksgiving
i
now
have
one
more
thing
to
be
thankful
for
d
exceptional
i
could
really
sit
and
session
with
this
sour
the
sourness
is
not
too
much
cuvee
rene
as
the
white
wine
barrel
aging
adds
residual
sweetness
definitely
a
top
100
beer
light
body
carbonation
level
is
right
on
the
money
make
your
own
lost
abbey
jokes
here
ridiculously
easy
drinker
for
a
sour
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
initial
sip
was
pretty
tart
and
i
was
expecting
for
that
to
continue
maybe
even
intensify
however
that
didnt
happen
and
the
finish
to
the
beer
was
a
little
too
weird
for
me
with
the
subtle
sweetness
i
was
picking
up
its
a
well
made
beer
but
as
a
person
that
craves
sours
every
now
and
then
this
definitely
doesnt
satisfy
my
fix
for
a
30
price
tag
id
much
rather
stick
to
cantillons
which
are
cheaper
and
better
imo
ddg
leans
more
toward
the
vinegar
compenent
of
an
awa
sampled
at
the
fobab
2009
the
pour
is
a
bright
and
clean
golden
color
with
a
big
billowing
white
head
both
the
nose
an
flavor
feature
lots
of
cheesy
and
tart
character
and
light
oak
character
all
throughout
this
yummy
stuff
that
is
certainly
worth
being
sought
after
the
taste
is
acidic
tart
lemon
and
orange
with
a
moderate
lactic
sourness
brett
provides
mustiness
moderate
funk
and
a
decided
cheese
quality
to
the
beer
the
tart
citrus
is
delicious
oak
is
evident
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
immensely
more
than
i
enjoyed
my
tap
sample
the
finish
is
acidic
citrus
with
a
lingering
tartness
and
lactic
sourness
this
stuff
is
killer
and
so
damn
drinkable
id
venture
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
wild
ales
and
a
marvel
of
blending
highly
recommended
this
beer
deserves
the
gold
medal
it
won
at
gabf
2009
this
is
about
as
drinkable
as
any
wild
ale
can
be
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
keeps
me
returning
to
the
glass
at
only
7
abv
id
pop
another
bottle
if
i
had
it
absolutely
recommended
im
completely
thankful
for
the
chance
to
try
it
d
my
kid
would
love
it
but
he
loves
sour
green
apple
bubble
gum
ok
so
do
i
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
very
drinkable
great
acidic
backbone
and
i
thought
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
pretty
well
balanced
a
touch
more
acidity
than
i
prefer
but
a
nice
depth
to
the
funk
puckering
tartness
funky
barnyard
acidic
apple
drying
tannin
buttery
oak
all
the
flavors
you
would
hope
for
and
then
some
i
preferred
cuvee
de
tomme
but
this
was
still
one
of
the
10
best
beers
i
had
that
weekend
and
there
was
plenty
of
greatness
to
choose
from
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
tasted
and
an
excellent
namelabel
too
well
done
d
drink
pretty
damn
easy
ive
had
this
a
couple
of
times
now
last
time
a
bottle
i
split
with
my
wife
just
a
fantastic
brew
and
everything
i
was
looking
for
in
the
style
sure
its
still
on
the
young
side
and
exhibits
more
of
the
acetic
and
lactic
notes
than
it
does
the
barnyard
at
this
juncture
but
i
like
that
too
really
its
a
matter
of
taste
the
analogy
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
of
a
soft
washed
rind
cheese
do
you
like
it
ripe
runny
and
rank
or
do
you
like
it
a
little
firmer
slightly
sour
and
just
a
bit
piquant
same
with
wild
ales
for
me
i
like
them
both
ways
and
i
think
one
can
have
a
classic
in
either
maturity
level
this
particular
beer
is
a
classic
for
me
in
the
younger
tarter
vein
this
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
wispy
head
that
sticks
around
smells
beautifully
balanced
with
sour
acetic
lactic
and
bright
fruit
the
fruit
components
showcase
orange
tangerine
and
muscat
just
beautiful
the
taste
has
a
long
lactic
finish
bright
citrus
and
some
light
funk
coupled
with
nice
firm
tannins
from
the
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
lactic
and
punchy
with
enough
tannins
to
give
some
structure
to
the
sour
fruit
great
beer
and
a
testament
to
what
lost
abbey
can
do
when
eveerything
goes
well
overall
an
exceptional
wild
ale
that
is
worthy
of
the
hype
and
praise
a
world
class
beer
very
reminiscent
of
isabelle
proximus
which
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
most
highly
recommend
rotation
not
available
here
and
extremely
hard
to
get
so
while
id
like
some
more
this
probably
it
for
now
if
here
i
would
get
several
bottles
a
year
d
pretty
drinkable
sour
very
intense
flavoring
but
it
all
blends
together
very
well
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
d
easy
drinking
considering
the
amount
of
sourness
and
funk
here
definitely
a
winner
from
lost
abbey
glad
i
hunted
this
down
duck

dry
sour

actually
pretty
drinkable
after
the
initial

shock
probably
not

but
still
very
good
recommended
bottle
at
the
rbsg
grand
tasting
thanks
to
tomme
via
alohac
who
just
walked
up
and
poured
it
into
my
glass
what
service
hazy
blond
color
with
a
white
head
funky
horsey
and
sour
aroma
with
a
tart
orange
juice
element
a
nice
level
of
sour
in
the
flavor
not
as
sour
as
the
better
belgian
gueuzes
but
with
a
similar
character
of
funk
and
lemon
pretty
good
stab
at
a
gueuze
but
i
couldnt
help
thinking
that
i
would
rather
go
out
and
buy
the
real
thing
for
less
money
d
drinkability
is
quite
high
as
i
took
my
second
sip
i
was
saddened
by
the
fact
that
i
had
only
another
700
ml
or
so
of
this
tart
puckering
nectar
while
this
may
not
have
been
the
kindest
year
to
lost
abbey
duck
duck
gooze
is
certainly
making
the
brightest
impression
upon
me
d
i
dont
even
know
what
to
write
for
drinkablility
although
i
do
wish
i
had
more
of
it
to
drink
d
high
this
is
actually
pretty
refreshing
for
a
wild
ale
and
goes
down
easy
despite
the
tartness
on
the
spectrum
of
lost
abbey
adventures
where
most
have
been
either
great
or
more
frequently
a
disaster
this
manages
to
be
somewhere
in
the
middle
golden
with
a
slight
haze
two
fingers
of
head
rises
from
vigorous
pouring
and
retains
fairly
well
ultimately
settling
to
a
thick
disc
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
complex
but
balanced
barnyard
funk
backed
by
lemon
and
orangelike
acidity
lactic
sourness
acetic
acid
and
a
unique
tropical
fruit
sweetness
that
really
makes
the
beer
opens
on
the
palate
with
sharp
lactic
acidity
and
wellexpressed
tannins
fruit
flavors
of
pineapple
orange
and
lemon
add
interesting
complexity
moderate
acetic
presence
midpalate
woody
and
lightly
astringent
with
the
malt
coming
out
a
bit
more
lending
a
light
sweetness
that
leads
into
a
dry
sharp
and
tannic
finish
the
noticeable
acetic
quality
is
a
slight
detraction
but
i
love
the
strong
tropical
fruit
character
another
winner
for
lost
abbey
they
should
really
concentrate
on
these
barrelaged
sour
beers
theyre
often
excellent
overall
lives
up
to
the
hype
machine
a
great
beer
and
though
labeled
an
american
wild
ale
the
closest
american
approximation
to
a
belgian
gueuze
that
ive
ever
tasted
id
say
i
have
a
second
bottle
that
im
going
to
age
and
give
another
try
well
see
how
this
one
grows
get
a
bottle
if
you
can
and
thats
why
today
bananas
are
called
yellow

d
well
worth
the
wait
this
is
fantastic
gueuzewild
ale
i
wish
i
could
drink
more
of
it
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
the
aroma
is
nicely
complex
and
though
the
flavor
could
be
a
little
bit
more
so
it
is
still
a
fine
tipple
overall
this
substitutes
very
nicely
for
a
traditional
belgiansourced
lambic
and
i
so
wish
i
had
a
bunch
of
bottles
of
this
for
those
who
like
a
more
integrated
faux
lambic
this
beer
will
be
enjoyed
a
bit
more
than
the
fresh
isabelle
proximus
comparing
these
fresh
though
i
liked
the
additional
complexity
of
the
isabelle
proximus
funkiness
and
oak
were
more
prominent
in
the
first
beer
released
this
is
still
quite
a
fine
beer
though
and
it
serves
as
proof
that
the
funky
beers
at
lost
abbey
are
still
strong
and
full
of
life
i
want
more
drinkability
no
sign
of
the
abv
and
quite
frankly
i
didnt
expect
any
as
most
of
the
style
are
in
the
reasonable
alcohol
content
department
that
being
said
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
for
me
it
makes
me
shudder
im
so
glad
i
opted
to
buy
this
being
a
sinners
club
member
so
many
positives
and
so
few
negatives
are
there
any

wow
this

is

one
of
the
best

beers
ive
had
in

love
this
stuff
wish
i
had
half
a
case
of
it
to
age
overall
wow
just
wow
i
had
been
worried
with
all
the
heat
that
lost
abbey
has
taken
recently
as
to
whether
or
not
this
one
would
stand
up
and
boy
did
it
ever
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
up
there
with
isabelle
and
beatification
this
thing
is
a
beast
this
must
be
sought
out
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
actually
surpassed
it
for
me
d
such
an
easy
wild
ale
to
drink
i
probably
could
have
drink
the
entire
bottle
myself
if
not
for
the
tasting
i
brought
this
bottle
to
cant
wait
to
crack
another
open
and
review
again
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
purchased
for
thirty
dollars
last
weekend
also
had
two
pints
of
it
there
along
with
a
few
samples
at
the
stone
sour
fest
the
week
before
that
opened
last
night
with
dane
since
he
had
not
had
it
yet
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
color
is
a
golden
orange
with
some
lighter
shades
one
inch
aggressively
bubbly
white
head
not
much
retention
pretty
weak
lacing
but
typical
of
the
style
aroma
consists
of
oak
tannins
lemons
oranges
tangerines
horse
blanket
funkiness
wild
yeast
white
wine
and
vinegar
flavor
starts
off
with
a
salty
tart
bite
full
of
citrus
some
malts
in
the
middle
that
are
bit
crackery
and
offset
the
tartiness
well
finish
is
pretty
dry
but
has
a
good
amount
of
funk
too
warms
up
with
green
apples
and
sour
citrusy
fruits
slightly
dry
citrusy
and
funky
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
highly
carbonated
taste
lingers
well
for
a
gueuze
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
crisp
and
light
feeling
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
have
been
waiting
for
this
one
for
years
since
i
first
laid
my
eyes
on
these
barrels
and
it
did
not
disappoint
it
should
develop
quite
a
bit
with
age
too
not
quite
a
gueuze
you
would
expect
from
belgium
but
a
quality
american
interpretation
will
be
drinking
again
recommended
overall
the
quality
and
complexity
of
this
sour
was
extremely
similar
to
those
brewed
by
russian
river
who
probably
do
the
best
job
with
this
style
a
must
have
cheers
d
a
delicious
beer
and
one
of
the
first
geuzes
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
i
know
that
i
could
definitely
do
worse
on
breaking
in
to
the
style
d
all
day
every
day
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
drinkability
as
drinkable
as
they
come
i
couldve
gone
through
pint
after
pint
of
this
and
wouldve
had
it
not
started
to
run
out
me
go
broke
but
as
great
as
id
hoped
and
heres
to
hoping
its
all
that
and
more
out
of
the
bottle
i
think
this
one
will
age
very
well
and
get
drier
and
funkier
as
the
years
go
by
looking
forward
to
having
a
pint
and
buying
some
bottles
of
this
at
the
upcoming
release
its
an
excellent
sour
light
yellow
and
murky
liquid
with
good
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
and
sour
lemons
with
a
refined
funk
the
flavor
is
pleasantly
sour
and
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
the
malt
gives
the
beer
a
refined
sweetness
its
a
refreshing
gueuze
with
an
easily
likable
flavor
while
i
like
strong
funk
and
sour
flavors
this
is
still
an
excellent
gueuze
update
somewhat
uniquely
amongst
lost
abbey
beers
recently
this
was
better
in
the
bottle
than
it
was
on
tap
shocking
i
know
the
citrus
and
vinous
vinegaryness
was
more
lipsmackingly
addictive
and
with
a
big
amount
to
linger
over
the
nuances
became
much
more
noticeable
the
oak
finish
and
unripe
apple
sensation
for
example
was
more
prominent
as
one
worked
their
way
through
a
larger
serving
size
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sours
ive
come
across
rbsg09
bottle
at
the
grand
tasting
courtesy
alohac
pale
milky
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
of
lemon
meringue
chlorine
honey
tart
and
acidic
flavor
but
not
that
sour
lemons
and
oranges
almost
pinesolesque
at
times
sweeter
grains
and
honeycaramel
pretty
dang
good
but
not
top

san

beer
week
2014
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
very
nice
sour
lots
of
flavors
going
definitely
worth
the
15
i
paid
too
bad
there
was
only
one
bottle
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
beer
now
you
like
sours
you
gotta
try
this
cheers
2011
vintage
straight
up
tomato
juice
my
first
sour
and
i
guess
these
take
some
getting
used
to
different
than
anything
ive
had
for
sure
but
interesting
mediocrity
at
its
finest
a
beer
i
have
missed
the
opportunity
to
try
on
many
occasions
so
a
real
treat
to
finally
encounter
it
again
i
was
taken
aback
by
its
dark
color
so
may
framboise
beers
are
just
pale
wheat
bases
with
the
fruit
this
appears
to
be
a
rich
brown
ale
deep
and
rich
looking
with
a
red
accent
from
the
fruit
not
what
i
expected
but
very
cool
the
nose
on
this
one
is
a
great
mix
of
chocolate
malt
from
the
base
beer
and
tart
freshness
from
the
berries
i
am
surprised
how
tart
they
really
are
rising
above
the
sweet
richness
of
the
brown
ale
base
which
is
quite
robust
on
the
grain
front
toasted
and
desserty
the
bacterial
aspect
of
this
is
cool
too
it
seems
to
exacerbate
the
intensity
of
the
fruit
and
brings
a
series
pucker
to
the
finish
of
this
the
malt
chocolate
thing
comes
back
a
touch
and
it
feels
like
a
nice
valentines
day
dessert
before
the
acidity
washes
it
out
the
lost
abbey
is
famous
for
a
reason
this
is
the
only
beer
of
its
kind
i
have
ever
tasted
and
think
it
is
more
than
worthy
of
its
high
praise
as
flavorful
a
beer
as
any
this
is
my
favorite
raspberry
sour
ive
ever
had
oa
good
sour
that
has
the
raspberry
flavor
down
d
still
just
starting
to
explore
wilds
but
this
was
a
real
nice
find
on
tap
a
little
heavy
on
the
vinegar
but
with
some
great
sour
cherry
and
raspberry
notes
and
just
the
right
amount
of
acidity
probably
wont
be
my
most
favorite
sour
ale
but
has
some
great
balance
and
depth
of
character
one
of
lost
abby
better
concoctions
i
would
say
makes
me
a
little
less
gun
shy
to
go
grab
some
bottles
now
terrific
american
sour
raspberries
are
huge
and
apparent
extremely
unique
and
awesome
sourness
is
perfect
oak
is
there
and
balances
it
well
would
drink
this
everyday
pours
an
odd
muddy
river
brownish
red
champagne
head
nose
is
raspberries
muscadine
grapes
and
a
little
funk
taste
is
raspberry
sour
cherry
and
lots
of
delicious
dry
carbonated
body
again
not
unlike
a
champagne
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sours
that
actually
tastes
like
the
fruit
it
claims
wife
picked
this
one
out
and
she
gets
2
thumbs
up
o
this
is
just
about
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
and
certainly
the
best
americanmade
fruited
sour
ive
tried
simply
a
masterpiece
overall
another
excellent
one
from
lost
abbey
i
had
this
side
by
side
with
duck
duck
gooze
and
cuvée
de
tomme
and
this
may
have
been
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
o
this
was
very
good
i
felt
like
it
wasnt
quite
as
complex
as
the
best
fruited
sours
and
the
increased
alcohol
heat
seemed
a
little
out
of
place
but
still
quite
enjoyable
pours
a
nice
deep
clear
ruby
red
with
purplish
head
nose
is
pungent
with
bright
notes
of
raspberry
heavy
fruit
paired
with
some
balsamic
vinegar
notes
present
on
nose
with
some
mild
earth
at
the
end
the
taste
is
a
slightly
tamed
down
version
of
the
nose
raspberries
are
all
over
the
place
balancing
between
fruity
sweetness
and
acidic
tartness
moderate
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
fizzy
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
one
of
the
highlights
for
me
at
this
years
fobab
the
balance
is
great
and
the
raspberry
character
is
strong
pours
a
brownish
red
haze
off
white
head
that
dies
down
slow
but
not
rapidly
has
nice
carbination
and
smells
tart
like
raspberries
and
cherries
taste
is
sour
not
quite
puckering
with
a
mouthfeel
a
little
thicker
than
other
framboise
upfront
sour
to
raspberries
to
an
almost
caramel
malt
maybe
a
little
barrel
this
one
goes
down
quick
and
i
definitely
appreciate
the
higher
abv
in
regards
to
the
style
a
lot
of
raspberry
acid
going
on
balanced
with
the
barrel
on
the
back
end
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
seemed
to
get
more
sour
as
the
glass
got
lower
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
complex
and
very
tart
sour
and
oh
boy
did
i
get
one
good
job
tomme
and
friends
yet
another
keeper
odone
of
my
more
sought
after
beers
what
a
beaut
i
feel
very
happy
unchecking
this
from
my
wants
list
jesus
i
love
raspberry
sours
intelligent
balance
of
wild
yeast
and
fruity
excess
with
the
tempering
influence
of
the
oak
treatment
loved
it
mf
high
carbonation
could
be
a
little
smoother
with
the
balance
of
tartness
and
fruit
a
i
always
think
this
style
is
good
but
this
went
down
easy
so
smooth
o
ok
wild
ale
little
too
much
of
vinegar
acetic
for
my
taste
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
pulls
off
that
one
dimension
thanks
for
this
one
kojevergas
i
recommend
picking
this
one
up
i
feel
like
if
i
tried
this
last
year
i
would
have
hated
it
but
the
more
i
drink
sourswild
ales
the
more
i
can
appreciate
a
beer
like
this
almost
winelike
at
times
with
a
raspberry
overall
tone
lots
of
wooden
barrel
lots
to
enjoy
but
again
this
is
on
the
vinegary
flanders
red
type
style
but
does
have
that
huge
lemonyacidic
flavor
that
overpowers
most
of
everything
else
o

im
very
glad
that
i
tried
this
beer
picked
up
on
our
recent
trip
to
the
west
coast
its
a
supedup
framboise
that
i
certainly
enjoyed
however
i
prefer
more
muted
and
refreshing
flavors
from
the
style
thinking
of
lindemanns
and
this
one
was
too
intense
for
the
style
for
me
i
actually
felt
embarrassed
bringing
this
to
the
tasting
we
did
enjoy
it
for
the
fruity
tarty
flavors
but
the
acid
and
extreme
sourness
provides
intensity
with
no
degree
of
satisfaction
in
return
i
know
this
wasnt
infected
or
anything
but
i
simply
feel
it
was
horribly
unbalanced
if
you
want
to
try
this
go
ahead
but
the
lost
abbey
definitely
has
better
sours
for
the
same
price
and
availability
in
their
catalogue
split
a
bottle
with
a
couple
friends
poured
into
a
wine
glass
the
appearance
is
dark
red
a
little
brownish
with
a
small
head
the
nose
has
raspberries
vinegar
oak
and
funk
it
really
comes
with
sourness
before
even
drinking
it
upon
tipping
some
back
i
taste
raspberries
cherries
caramel
and
some
red
wine
mouthfeel
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
sourness
lingers
with
you
a
great
wildsour
beer
from
a
u
s
brewer
i
would
love
if
we
could
get
this
in
connecticut
or
even
new
york
o
excellent
sour
here
about
the
only
one
that
can
hold
a
flame
to
supplication
overall
this
is
an
excellent
sour
if
your
into
the
style
id
say
you
have
to
try
this
one
drinkability
i
think
it
is
a
bit
too
tart
to
be
super
drinkable
tart
rather
than
sweet
to
start
but
hugely
berry
flavored
some
bitterness
for
the
finish
a
slight
sweetness
creeps
in
along
with
the
vinegar
edge
it
does
taste
just
like
raspberries
which
the
brewer
says
were
added
again
during
the
yearlong
wine
barrel
aging
this
is
actually
quite
sippable
though
unmistakably
a
serious
sour
i
can
see
why
lost
abbey
has
the
reputation
for
brewing
great
sours
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
the
beer
pours
a
dull
yeast
speckled
hazy
light
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
is
sweet
with
potent
oak
and
raspberries
the
taste
is
slightly
funky
followed
by
tart
raspberries
a
caramelized
sugar
sweetness
and
a
semidry
lingering
raspberry
cake
finish
great
malt
presence
that
serves
to
accentuate
the
dark
fruitiness
of
the
raspberries
the
mouthfeel
is
solidly
medium
bodied
slightly
bready
with
great
oaked
fruit
character
and
a
slightly
salty
dry
finish
very
enjoyable
beer
thats
completely
worth
the
effort
to
obtain
the
palate
opens
bright
fruity
and
sharp
jammy
raspberries
minimally
seedy
with
a
little
bit
of
strawberry
character
as
well
the
fruity
expression
is
excellent
this
is
followed
by
the
sour
base
where
the
lactic
acidity
pairs
quite
well
with
the
fruit
theres
also
a
hint
of
lemon
as
well
as
some
acetic
character
a
little
frothyyogurty
as
well
the
midpalate
is
a
little
chunkyyeasty
some
oak
tannins
are
present
rather
wellintegrated
with
the
profile
the
finish
is
strongly
lactic
scrubbing
the
palate
almost
a
little
too
much
leaving
a
clean
yogurt
sourness
and
flavor
along
a
clean
raspberry
sourness
it
does
however
feel
a
little
watery
mediummedium
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
the
softnessfullness
that
the
yeastproteins
lend
does
clash
with
the
brightness
of
the
fruit
but
ultimately
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
brewed
raspberry
sours
ive
had
well
done
tomme
very
nice
raspberry
a
bit
hidden
more
of
a
flanders
style
beer
with
abit
of
sweet
malt
in
there
a
solid
sour
good
funk
and
nice
fruit
works
really
well
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
sour
im
not
even
usually
a
fan
of
framboise
bit
the
tartness
and
balance
on
this
one
are
superb
one
of
my
favorite
sours
hands
down
o
overall
this
makes
a
great
sour
the
sourness
and
raspberry
flavors
are
balanced
very
well
its
not
overly
sour
or
funky
highly
drinkable
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
murky
looking
red
color
with
an
off
white
pinkish
foamy
head
on
top
the
retention
here
is
a
good
and
so
is
the
lacing
on
the
glass
very
pretty
looking
beer
all
around
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
plenty
of
raspberry
aromas
some
nice
fresh
oak
and
some
subtle
funk
in
there
too
the
taste
is
excellent
in
my
opinion
there
is
an
explosion
of
raspberry
with
the
tartness
of
the
fruit
itself
mixing
with
the
oak
from
the
barrels
and
the
wild
yeast
the
sourness
of
the
beer
is
very
tolerable
in
my
opinion
and
still
remains
very
easy
to
drink
the
after
taste
brings
out
some
of
the
malt
in
the
base
of
the
beer
as
the
fruit
subsides
there
is
also
some
hints
of
cocoa
in
there
as
well
in
the
late
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
good
its
a
little
thin
but
had
a
moderate
carbonation
to
it
overall
it
was
highly
enjoyable
i
would
order
this
beer
again
in
a
heartbeat
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
if
i
ever
have
it
again
i
want
to
have
it
with
a
rich
chocolate
dessert
of
some
kind
pours
a
rather
murky
chocolate
cherry
with
a
brown
pink
fuzz
on
top
lots
of
tart
raspberries
some
must
barn
lemon
and
oak
nice
hint
of
vanilla
as
well
flavor
is
oaky
with
plenty
of
fruit
flavor
and
slight
bitterness
also
has
the
aftertaste
of
a
really
rich
raspberry
truffle
some
bits
of
wood
and
vine
i
like
the
flavor
on
this
one
quite
a
bit
medium
bodied
with
sharp
tight
fleeting
carb
and
a
wet
finish
nice
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
ive
had
from
the
abbey
o
tart
and
sweet
nice
balance
oaky
tart
lasts
a
long
time
o
i
havent
had
too
many
framboises
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
not
my
favorite
sour
ive
had
and
definitely
not
the
sourest
but
definitely
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
that
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
but
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
night
it
had
a
nice
raspberry
flavor
with
a
decent
tartness
that
could
have
maybe
been
toned
up
a
little
bit
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
if
you
like
raspberries
solid
beer
although
falls
a
bit
shy
of
hype
for
me
still
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
get
it
but
not
worth
trading
any
rarities
for
a
really
nice
wild
that
has
a
lot
of
sour
fruit
going
on
which
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
a
good
one
from
tomme
and
company
at
lost
abbey
recommend
d
overall
very
solid
framboise
ties
in
some
nice
citric
tones
and
the
mustiness
adds
a
layer
of
complexity
damn
good
framboise
wish
i
could
try
this
next
to
ffac
o
a
very
nice
wild
ale
very
balanced
in
terms
of
flavor
and
sourtartness
pours
a
clear
dark
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
pretty
sour
and
tart
with
lots
of
fresh
raspberry
and
raspberry
juice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
quality
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
pretty
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
tasty
and
well
constructed
o
an
excellent
beer
the
raspberry
flavor
really
shines
and
the
tartness
and
malt
flavor
does
a
great
job
of
highlighting
it
and
balancing
it
out
overall
wellmade
sour
but
lacking
in
complexity
the
fruit
doesnt
do
enough
to
overcome
the
simplicity
of
the
yeast
strain
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
real
sour
or
tart
but
it
definitely
has
the
characteristics
of
a
sour
with
a
nice
raspberry
flavor
overall
a
nice
sour
with
lots
of
barrel
goodness
o
smooth
and
bitter
leathery
and
almost
buttery
denise
thinks
the
body
is
too
thick
but
i
enjoy
it
a
decent
sour
overall
but
not
worth
bending
over
backwards
to
find
it
o
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
fruity
raspberry
considering
the
freshness
of
the
bottle
but
i
am
very
happy
with
the
funkiness
and
intensity
of
the
tartness
extremely
nice
raspberry
wild
ale
aside
from
too
much
carbonation
the
flavor
profile
was
spot
on
i
really
liked
the
acidic
and
lactic
tartness
in
this
beer
perhaps
id
prefer
it
a
bit
less
dry
nicely
done
o
im
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
mouth
puckering
tartness
with
the
added
bonus
of
raspberry
funk
great
mouthfeel
and
enough
complexity
for
me
to
keep
drinking
it
this
definitely
holds
up
as
one
of
the
better
american
wilds
out
there
and
seems
to
age
well
for
the
year
ive
had
it
sitting
ill
definitely
be
seeking
this
in
the
future
o
i
really
like
it
extremely
drinkable
i
can
drink
this
like
the
british
can
drink
pints
of
bitters
i
love
how
the
fruit
flavors
play
with
the
caramel
malt
flavors
i
cant
say
for
sure
whether
its
better
or
worse
than
the
red
poppy
but
it
shares
many
of
its
characteristics
4
5
o
a
great
american
framboise
m
medium
body
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
would
like
less
carbonation
in
this
one
cant
believe
i
am
complaining
about
too
much
carbonation
in
a
lost
abbey
beer
o
understand
the
demand
very
nice
and
id
love
to
try
again
with
some
goggles
on
quite
good
overall
this
is
a
solid
wild
ale
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
beer
as
i
have
some
09
10
and
11
ageing
i
think
it
is
going
to
be
amazing
o
this
is
really
what
a
fruit
wild
ale
is
all
about
over
the
top
fruit
and
sour
yet
not
overdone
o
overall
i
love
this
beer
so
freaking
good
with
delicious
raspberries
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
on
tap
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
and
quite
packed
with
real
raspberry
flavor
and
a
boat
ton
of
tartness
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
this
sour
but
i
am
quite
pleased
with
the
outcome
you
definitely
need
to
be
a
fan
of
sour
beers
and
raspberries
to
enjoy
this
sour
more
so
than
raspberry
definitely
recommended
but
not
totally
sure
it
is
worth
the
outlay
to
aquire
given
the
rarity
andor
price
o
impressive
love
the
sour
puckering
notes
was
not
disappointed
love
the
fruitiness
raspberries
nice
oak
nice
complexity
really
enjoyable
bottle
shared
at
one
of
the
many
santa
cruz
tastings
review
from
notes
pours
a
dark
orangey
red
with
a
small
khaki
head
aroma
is
tart
and
fruity
with
a
massive
emphasis
on
fresh
raspberries
and
lesser
accents
of
green
apple
skin
sour
raspberry
flavor
washes
over
the
palate
before
leaving
some
sweeter
candied
berry
notes
touches
of
wood
and
a
helping
of
funk
with
lactic
tartness
high
carbonation
maybe
a
little
coarse
and
fizzy
a
very
good
sour
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
solid
appearance
with
some
nice
continuing
carbonation
and
a
foamy
head
nose
is
full
on
fermented
raspberry
flavor
is
a
vinegary
malty
acidic
raspberry
very
full
flavored
and
nicely
balanced
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
pours
a
very
thin
super
carbonated
light
reddish
brown
that
if
not
for
the
huge
frothy
head
this
brew
would
look
more
like
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
tart
smells
of
raspberries
dominate
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
grapes
and
cherries
adding
to
a
unique
aroma
first
sip
is
almost
puckering
tart
with
plenty
of
sweetness
left
to
make
even
the
most
controlled
diabetics
reaching
for
their
insulin
the
raspberries
make
up
the
majority
of
the
flavor
not
much
of
anything
else
there
body
is
super
thin
but
the
over
carbonation
compensates
to
the
point
that
mouthfeel
is
quite
pleasant
i
do
believe
more
time
will
help
this
puppy
time
will
tell
o
great
beer
maybe
lost
abbey
should
give
up
on
everything
else
for
now
and
just
focus
on
their
wilds
overall
fda
is
comparable
to
drinking
a
super
tasty
framboise
tinged
with
the
cheesy
funk
of
a
typical
jolly
pumpkin
though
the
oak
characteristics
complement
the
overall
flavor
perfectly
also
complements
well
with
the
brie
im
pairing
it
with
this
is
a
repeatfunk
cheddaroffender
and
ill
be
returning
as
much
as
humanly
possible
bottle
poured
a
light
reddish
color
ale
with
a
light
link
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
fresh
raspberry
with
tart
notes
is
quite
sublime
taste
is
a
very
interesting
mix
between
some
fresh
raspberry
juice
with
notes
and
no
sweetener
with
some
light
oak
notes
body
is
quite
full
for
style
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
brewed
with
great
level
of
complexity
while
retaining
a
good
level
of
drinkability
overall
this
bottle
tastes
much
more
vinegary
that
previous
bottles
ive
had
the
raspberry
has
faded
significantly
over
the
past
two
years
i
dont
recommend
holding
onto
this
for
more
than
one
year
overall
certainly
something
to
keep
around
the
kitchen
for
pairing
also
certainly
something
non
beer
lovers
could
enjoy
or
even
a
beer
lover
terrific
beer
nice
strong
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
beer
one
i
believe
i
had
the
opportunity
to
buy
once
or
twice
but
simply
assumed
it
wasnt
going
to
be
worthwhile
this
one
isnt
talked
about
like
many
of
the
other
la
beers
but
this
is
a
prime
example
of
why
the
brewery
is
at
least
capable
of
producing
world
class
beer
odamm
good
beer
fresh
this
was
sweet
and
delicious
aged
its
tart
and
delicious
nice
job
lost
abbey
light
brown
pour
into
a
tulip
with
a
quickly
dissipating
beige
head
lacing
holds
aroma
is
the
most
wonderful
sweet
tart
raspberry
smell
i
have
encountered
in
a
beer
exceptional
taste
offers
only
a
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
aftertaste
other
than
that
it
is
a
sour
bomb
all
the
way
first
sips
are
highly
carbonated
and
overly
prickly
on
the
tongue
but
this
subsides
much
more
character
of
the
fruit
than
other
wilds
making
this
more
of
a
sour
fruit
beer
in
my
opinion
it
is
really
quite
good
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
overall
this
is
a
good
sour
fruit
beer
a
lot
smoother
than
riserva
i
would
definitely
have
another
overall
a
mellow
and
delicatelycrafted
lambic
while
it
may
lack
complexity
it
provides
plenty
of
raspberry
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sourness
happy
i
got
to
try
this
one
overall
a
very
good
sour
not
a
big
fan
of
sour
but
this
one
works
skål
fda
is
a
ruddy
reddish
amber
with
just
a
collar
of
pinkish
white
foam
the
beer
smeels
very
fruity
like
raspberry
preserves
with
just
a
little
damp
hay
funk
the
beer
has
crisp
acidity
bright
fruit
and
a
nice
funky
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
luscious
an
excellent
beer
that
i
could
absolutely
pound

to
score
this

this
was
so
damn
good
an
expensive
gamble
but
one
that
very
fortunately
paid
off
for
me
a
delicious
awa
one
that
im
very
pleased
to
have
sampled
cheers
tomme
o
very
good
beer
and
it
seems
like
its
under
control
carbonation
was
fine
no
gushing
and
there
was
no
infection
glad
this
beer
is
back
to
a
drinkable
form
overall
quite
good
overall
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
so
much
in
fact
i
will
be
seeking
another
one
out
one
of
my
favorite
fruits
is
raspberry
and
this
beer
delivers
in
that
category
just
a
damn
good
beer
thanks
again
to
chris
for
the
beer
d
huge
acidity
makes
the
drinkability
lower
than
average
however
the
flavor
and
aroma
more
than
make
up
for
it
overall
an
amazing
wild
ale
that
everyone
should
try
if
they
can
get
their
hands
on
it
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
carb
was
fine
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
the
best
la
beer
ive
ever
had
and
maybe
the
best
raspberry
beer
ive
ever
had
a
winner
o
a
decent
brew
but
not
my
favorite
frambois
could
have
been
a
touch
sweeter
and
would
have
been
good
to

their
unending
love
notwithstanding
her
acerbic
parents
brought
her
up
to
speak
her
mind
truthfully
and
freely
at
all
times
no
matter
how
scathing
ohohoh
the
duchess
of
piedmont
fell
down
two
stairs
to
her
knees
upon
the
rich
velvet
of
countess
briochesss
train
your
steps
lack
precision
due
to
the
mass
pressed
upon
them
mme
brioche
commented
and
felt
a
slight
pang
at
her
ejaculation
it
wasnt
fair
to
cut
others
so
deeply
with
such
a
bitter
acerbic
purity
somehow
in
this
acidic
repartee
others
saw
themselves
and
their
own
shortcomings
despite
the
caustic
burns
they
received
countess
brioche
looked
upon
a
bustling
courtyard
of
servants
who
despised
her
but
respected
her
stinging
candor
its
no
raspberry
tart
but
that
shouldnt
be
the
standard
tasty
stuff
how
this
costs
twice
as
much
in
the
bottle
at
a
store
versus
ontap
at
a
bar
will
remain
one
of
lifes
greatest
mysteries
this
is
my
first
review
btw
feedback
is
appreciated
shared
this
with
emmasdad
on
thursday
night
a
bit
worried
about
whether
this
would
be
carbonated
or
not
had
a
distinct
pop
when
the
cork
was
removed
poured
a
dark
red
with
a
small
white
head
the
quickly
dissipated
aroma
of
raspberries
and
malt
taste
was
wonderful
very
tart
raspberries
malt
and
a
slight
vinegar
taste
with
no
hop
bitterness
at
all
excellent
brew
wish
i
had
more
thanks
to
schmittymack
for
sharing
a
bottle
of
this
one
with
me
last
night
opened
with
an
audible
pop
which
we
took
as
a
good
sign
poured
a
brilliant
red
color
with
a
light
white
head
very
tart
aromas
of
fresh
raspberries
and
slight
vinegar
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
bodied
sour
and
extremely
tart
very
fresh
raspberry
flavors
and
some
red
wine
vinegar
fda
arrives
with
little
to
no
head
a
ring
of
fizz
is
present
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
and
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
rises
in
the
center
the
color
is
red
hued
mahogany
like
a
finished
piece
of
fine
hardwood
the
aroma
is
of
sour
red
fruit
not
surprisingly
raspberries
predominate
the
beer
smells
tart
and
fruity
taste
follows
wih
huge
raspberry
notes
the
initial
fruity
sweetness
is
followed
by
a
blast
of
acetic
sourness
vinegar
and
light
funk
present
themselves
as
my
mouth
puckers
wonderfully
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
lingering
tartness
raspberries
abound
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
very
refreshingly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
the
over
the
top
raspberries
coupled
with
mouth
puckering
sour
qualities
make
this
a
joy
to
imbibe
i
can
never
get
enough
of
this
one
well
done
lost
abbey
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
leaning
more
towards
medium
and
quite
creamy
and
smooth
in
texture
the
light
amount
of
carbonation
exaggerates
the
thick
fullness
of
this
brew
much
more
fruited
and
sour
than
i
was
expecting
but
that
is
welcomed
very
well
hidden
abv
except
for
its
warming
factor
rating
93
out
of
100
one
of
the
best
raspberry
sours
ive
had
lots
of
fruit
funk
and
definitely
last
awhile
being
so
darn
funky
and
flavorful
everyone
into
sours
especially
fruity
sours
should
seek
this
one
out
this
was
my
only
bottle
thanks
hurfer
but
i
will
more
than
likely
be
trading
for
more
medium
bodied
a
bit
lighter
on
the
carbonation
but
better
than
duck
duck
guava
was
lingering
and
biting
on
the
tongue
i
really
was
into
this
one
more
so
than
some
other
la
beers
ive
had
and
this
was
the
only
beer
that
had
me
going
back
for
more
that
day
overall
delicious
as
expected
nice
tart
raspberry
flavors
great
fruit
light
funk
but
just
missing
the
carbonation
o
this
was
a
treat
for
beer
week
and
im
going
to
seek
it
out
again
before
the
week
is
over
thank
you
tom
and
tomme
for
making
this
happen
very
amazing
beer
here
and
i
want
the
double
version
o
this
is
a
spectacular
beer
holds
its
own
against
some
of
the
best
from
belgium
and
the
best
american
copy
ive
ever
had
just
blown
away
love
it
o
this
is
a
very
good
sour
the
taste
is
wonderful
which
makes
this
one
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
sours
this
one
to
try
and
hunt
down
o
a
very
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
lost
abbey
i
enoyed
it
about
as
much
as
ddg
headtohead
when
masterski
shared
a
bottle
of
this
with
me
in
july
of
last
year
it
was
not
drinking
quite
as
good
certainly
framboise
de
amorosa
is
a
terrific
beer
my
only
gripe
was
that
carbonation
issues
really
got
in
the
way
of
its
appearance
as
well
as
how
much
of
the
beer
i
actually
had
a
chance
to
enjoy
tomme
when
are
these
problems
going
to
be
solved
o
amazing
beer
loved
it
last
year
and
im
loving
it
more
this
time
around
thanks
to
hurfer
for
the
assist
poured
on
tap
into
smaller
wine
glass
pours
grapefruit
red
no
head
sour
cherry
wheat
raspberry
and
maybe
a
little
watermelon
on
the
nose
very
delectable
taste
is
quite
tart
reminds
me
of
the
black
raspberry
sour
warhead
candy
mouth
feel
is
awesome
the
initial
carb
goes
excellent
with
the
tartness
it
almost
excels
the
experience
overall
i
am
comfortable
saying
this
is
a
great
beer
very
refreshing
and
an
awesome
cap
to
the
session
very
very
tasty
beer
definitely
recommended
o
a
decent
offering
from
lost
abbey
glad
to
have
tried
it
drink
i
would
like
to
have
this
again
with
a
nice
cheesecake
or
paired
with
something
to
really
highlight
those
flavors
very
tart
sour
sweet
lush
loved
it
not
recommended
for
novices
highly
recommended
for
those
off
the
beaten
path
overall
i
loved
the
aroma
of
framboise
but
it
lacked
in
taste
for
me
i
do
think
that
it
will
benefit
from
aging
in
the
bottle
and
will
mellow
out
to
become
a
great
beer
i
love
sours
they
are
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
was
too
sour
with
not
enough
balance
for
me
the
beer
pours
out
a
dark
pink
color
with
a
tan
head
that
has
great
retention
but
isnt
very
fine
sparse
bubbles
the
color
is
very
murky
the
aroma
is
incredibly
balanced
between
the
high
acidic
sourness
and
the
raspberry
great
sour
smell
the
raspberry
is
very
noticeable
an
compliments
the
beers
flavors
very
well
there
is
no
acetobacter
and
the
sourness
is
absolutely
spoton
what
a
beer
one
of
my
favorite
styles
when
done
the
right
way
this
being
a
killer
american
fruited
sour
id
love
to
try
the
base
beer
also
in
the
mouth
it
has
a
medium
body
which
is
lightened
by
the
high
carbonation
which
combined
with
refreshing
sourness
acidity
and
tartness
from
fruit
makes
this
super
drinkable
i
wish
it
would
last
longer
went
to
the
release
and
had
this
on
draft
also
just
popped
one
of
my
4
bottles
open
the
other
night
with
my
girlfriend
and
buddy
i
will
be
reviewing
the
one
i
had
on
draft
drove
all
the
way
from
fresno
for
this
pours
a
very
murky
brownishred
color
with
very
little
head
scent
is
strong
raspberry
with
hints
of
funk
oak
and
sour
aromas
taste
is
initially
sweet
fresh
raspberry
goodness
finishes
very
sour
and
acidic
there
are
some
lovely
wooden
notes
throughout
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
and
thick
it
reminds
me
of
some
very
acidic
unfiltered
fruit
juice
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
beer
was
just
fantastic
at
the
release
im
interested
to
see
how
the
remaining
bottles
hold
up
over
time
this
is
the
second
truly
spectacular
beer
ive
had
from
lost
abbey
o
i
had
a
sample
on
tap
at
the
release
party
that
i
remember
being
a
little
sweeter
i
think
i
like
this
pour
better
but
probably
because
it
is
not
1030
in
the
morning
right
now
15
might
be
a
little
steep
but
i
guess
it
is
worth
it
due
to
the
quality
and
rareness
framboise
de
amorosa
raspberry
lover
is
a
lovely
little
raspberry
wild
ale
that
does
just
about
everything
right
even
though
it
was
overpriced
at
15
for
just
12
7
ounces
it
was
probably
pretty
expensive
to
produce
thank
you
to
whoever
sent
me
the
bottle
o
im
not
entirely
sure
that
it
was
worth
the
trip
down
to
san
diego
but
it
was
definitely
worth
a
taste
id
drinkbuy
it
again
but
id
probably
split
the
bottle
its
a
tasty
sour
tart
beer
i
had
3
pints
of
it
on
tap
at
the
release
and
i
could
drink
this
all
day
well
done
i
really
liked
this
one
the
raspberry
flavor
is
strong
and
its
nice
and
sour
in
the
finish
right
up
my
alley
light
and
crisp
body
here
good
lively
carbonation
i
heard
this
was
a
gusher
but
not
my
bottle
so
lucky
me
drinks
like
a
champ
i
love
this
beer
and
im
kind
of
pissed
that
i
shared
with
andy
this
is
drinking
very
well
right
now
but
the
vinegar
presence
wories
me
a
bit
may
not
be
the
best
candidate
for
the
cellar
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
poured
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
very
minimal
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
maple
syrup
oak
and
slight
mothballs
oxidation
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
maple
syrup
raspberries
oak
and
oxidation
sigh
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
very
low
carbonation
almost
flat
overall
i
believe
this
brew
was
treated
badly
in
its
past
there
was
no
visible
leaking
from
the
cork
to
hint
that
oxidation
should
be
present
so
i
was
quite
surprised
when
i
found
it
to
be
so
i
will
say
there
wasnt
anything
aweinspiring
in
this
one
to
say
the
least
hate
that
this
one
was
oxidized
still
had
a
decent
flavor
i
could
tell
from
the
background
notes
in
this
one
but
the
oxidation
was
just
overpowering
aroma
was
okay
on
this
one
would
love
to
try
one
that
had
been
treated
nicely
in
its
past
shared
by
chris
and
reviewed
from
notes
poured
into
a
lost
abbey
tumbler
murky

intense
big

up

a
bit
of
that
trademark
lost
abbey
funk
some
blueberries
slightly
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonation
very
acidic
makes
it
feel
like
it
is
coating
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
over
the
top
sourness
without
any
kind
of
balancing
could
definitley
be
improved
with
a
bit
of
oak
or
more
wild
yeast
flavors
and
aromas
d
goes
down
tart
and
easy
really
great
drinking
not
overpowering
d
this
was
nice
light
and
refreshing
i
could
have
drank
this
in
the
warm
san
diegocarlsbad
sun
for
a
bit
it
was
a
great
break
between
tons
of
heavy
barrel
aged
stouts
and
water
very
agreeable
and
would
easily
be
something
to
have
a
sour
hater
try
and
be
swayed
dvery
very
tasty
brew
that
can
hang
with
the
best
of
them
and
was
drinking
so
good
im
definitely
glad
i
have
another
bottle
stashed
away
i
was
honestly
ready
to
be
disappointed
by
this
beer
for
some
reason
but
it
came
up
big
for
me
d
housed
the
whole
bottle
by
myself
so
its
quite
drinkable
even
after
drinking
the
whole
bottle
i
still
felt
like
i
could
drink
more
sour
beerwhich
is
rare
for
me

if
it
hadnt
been
for

so
much
of
this
beer
on
my
porch
and
it
would
be
even
better
if
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
been
saving
this
one
for
a
little
bit
pours
a
deep
deep
red
that
is
just
translucent
lovely
bottle
conditioned
dense
one
finger
head
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
but
there
are
some
sticky
spots
aroma
is
a
blast
of
sharp
tart
raspberry
damp
hay
and
straw
light
brett
funk
and
a
slight
bit
of
wood
the
flavor

by
sour

and
oaky

the
sour
is
a
deep
sour
not
so
much
tart
earthy
musty
woody
undertones
not
too
funky
though
seems
the
light
brett
aroma
is
left
in
the
hose
and
doesnt
carry
to
the
flavor
just
a
tad
of
piecrust
great
cleansing
dry
finish
that
leaves
a
pucker
of
raspberry
on
the
tongue
feels
a
little
fuller
then
a
standard
framboise
a
great
beer
for
sure
i
enjoyed
this
no
shortage
of
raspberry
flavor
was
present
and
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
this
avoided
coming
off
as
overly
souring
or
acidic
although
it
did
have
quite
a
nice
bite
and
some
well
down
subdued
funkiness
to
it
i
had
no
problem
getting
through
the
glass
this
is
a
good
one
from
the
lost
abbey
d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
wild
ale
and
that
it
smelled
fantastic
lots
of
sour
raspberries
and
dark
fruit
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
would
definitely
try
again
d
if
you
dont
like
raspberries
youre
going
to
hate
this
brew
i
had
a
23oz
serving
and
that
was
plenty
but
i
savored
every
last
drop
a
very
dramatic
beer
aromatically
alluring
with
a
forceful
luscious
taste
and
enveloping
mouthfeel
sexy
but
not
beautiful
md
very
drinkable
and
smooth
light
in
the
mouth
overall
a
very
decent
framboise
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
it
though
it
is
quite
heavy
on
the
acidity
drinkability
after
having
lived
through
a
number
of
clunky
though
tasty
beers
from
this
brewery
it
is
nice
to
see
tomme
get
the
carbonation
level
right
on
this
one
at
least
on
my
bottle
as
others
have
suffered
through
gushers
this
is
among
the
very
best
beers
that
lost
abbey
has
produced
d
awesome
wild
that
is
a
treat
to
have
and
i
hope
to
find
this
again
only
reason
it
doesnt
get
a
5
for
me
for
drinkability
is
that
id
be
hard
to
put
a
whole
lot
of
this
down
in
a
sitting
but
really
great
in
small
doses
highly
recommended
provided
you
open
it
very
cold
open
gently
and
allow
the
sediment
to
settle
this
is
an
incredibly
rewarding
beer
d
i
am
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
one
fitting
the
style
well
yet
more
like
a
combo
of
a
fruit
lambic
and
a
flanders
in
my
opinion
ridiculously
sour
and
acidic
yet
i
like
it
i
enjoyed
this
one
in
a
style
quickly
going
up
the
ranks
as
my
favorite
style
this
is
likely
the
best
framboise
made
outside
of
the
sienne
valley
of
belgium
where
the
beer
remains
largely
normal
throughout
the
intangible
almondy
flavor
and
feel
separates
the
men
from
the
boys
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
wish
i
had
a
750
instead
would
seek
out
but
wouldnt
trade
my
cellar
for
it
bottle
enormous
gusher
lost
about
half
the
bottle
nose
is
wrought
with
that
really
distinctive
lost
abbey
wild
yeast
round
soft
mildly
dry
and
raspberry
seeds
dark
crimson
to
maroon
thick
and
opaque
i
thought
it
was
initially
almost
pielike
on
the
first
sip
tons
of
raspberry
flavors
swirling
about
ranging
from
a
dry
lambic
to
seeds
in
raspberry
jam
chewy
not
overly
sour
or
dry
as
a
whole
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
some
of
the
harder
framboise
a
nice
expression
but
rather
singular
and
not
particularly
complex
overall
this
was
one
of
the
most
tart
beers
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
not
quite
smooth
enough
to
be
great
but
a
solid
beer
for
which
you
need
to
prepare
your
tastebuds
well
worth
a
shot
bottle
courtesy
of
a
fellow
ba
that
wanted
to
share
the
bottle
with
some
friends
pours
a
really
nice
reddish
mahagony
with
a
great
fluffy
head
that
dissapates
rather
quickly
sour
and
tart
sweet
raspberry
flavor
slight
funk
bites
the
tongue
with
its
tartness
a
really
special
treat
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
totally
seek
out
m
d
tartness
with
a
touch
of
stingburn
on
the
way
down
a
little
tamer
and
it
would
could
be
perfect
taste
is
bracingly
sour
strong
raspberry
flavor
with
that
seed
taste
similar
to
cherry
pit
just
sour
lactic
eggy
and
a
little
too
much
vinegar
acetobacter
seems
to
be
too
strong
in
this
beer
this
would
be
awesome
if
it
was
somewhat
under
control
and
some
brett
funk
was
noticeable
d
up
there
but
to
be
fair
i
could
have
stayed
all
day
this
is
a
good
beer
at
best
imho
i
could
sit
and
smell
it
for
hours
but
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
thru
the
bottle
in
terms
of
the
taste
i
dont
seem
to
have
that
problem
with
sours
from
that
other
california
brewery
j
drinks
like
domination
the
flavors
of
amorosa
are
utterly
enjoyable
but
the
sourness
is
overbearing
to
the
point
that
its
difficult
to
drink
i
couldnt
finish
more
than
one
glass
while
this
beer
was
enough
to
satisfy
seasoned
sour
beer
drinkers
i
would
definitely
be
comfortable
using
it
as
an
introductory
beer
for
initiates
to
the
sour
beer
scene
very
well
done
this
beer
is
rubyhued
with
a
mediumsized
head
and
a
little
lacing
left
stuck
on
the
glass
tart
raspberries
and
wild
yeast
make
up
the
aromas
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
suit
this
beer
is
delicious
its
nice
and
dry
with
an
excellent
balance
of
fruit
and
tart
there
is
a
slight
alcoholic
note
in
the
finish
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
anytime
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
was
a
gusher
upon
open
much
of
the
beer
was
lost
over
the
side
this
was
sad
the
beer
that
was
left
helped
cheer
me
up
though
pours
a
deep
red
with
pink
head
tons
of
raspberry
in
the
smell
had
a
sour
raspberry
flavour
very
tart
and
delicious
tons
of
carbonation
as
evidenced
by
the
gushing
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
low
overall
this
was
a
really
bad
beer
experience
i
hope
to
get
to
try
another
bottle
sometime
in
the
future
to
see
if
this
one
was
an
exception
but
nonetheless
i
have
to
reveiw
this
beer
and
this
beer
was
not
good
skal
oh
well
i
didnt
pay
a
dime
for
it
and
despite
my
disappointment
i
still
am
very
grateful
for
having
been
able
to
give
it
a
try
and
see
what
all
the
hypes
about
needless
to
say
though
i
wont
be
seeking
out
another
watch
out
for
the
gusher
make
sure
you
have
a
big
glass
ready
to
go
seek
it
out
if
you
have
the
means
flavor
is
also
excelent
after
a
night
of
barrel
aged
beers
from
lost
abbey
this
really
hit
the
spot
flavor
is
a
lot
more
tart
then
expected
which
is
awesome
fruitsraspberries
are
definitely
forward
but
mix
wonderfully
with
the
wild
yeast
seems
like
theres
sugars
added
to
provide
a
sweet
backdrop
to
this
beer
where
as
traditional
lambics
may
be
even
more
tart
and
less
sweet
either
way
its
still
delicious
and
way
drinkable
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
booze
isnt
noticeable
at
all
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
as
of
right
now
though
this
beer
is
a
huge
let
down
what
a
monumental
disappointment
in
the
end
the
aroma
appearance
texture
and
flavor
were
all
majorly
negatively
impacted
by
the
horrible
bottle
conditioning
i
am
definitely
peeved
that
i
lost
80
of
this
15
dollar
beer
i
think
i
would
have
actually
enjoyed
this
if
it
had
been
properly
bottleconditioned
how
this
ended
up
this
way
i
dont
even
want
to
know
but
i
really
really
hope
i
get
to
try
a
decent
sample
of
this
some
day
refreshing
and
delicious
a
true
winner
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
from
lost
abbey
though
they
seemingly
still
have
some
sort
of
carbonation
issue
as
ive
never
lost
this
much
beer
in
a
gusher
however
unlike
with
the
flatter
beers
from
last
year
the
carbonation
doesnt
really
take
away
from
the
quality
of
this
beer
another
fantastic
bottle
shared
by
the
generous
jedwards
pours
a
muted
raspberry
with
a
loose
quarter
inch
head
that
dissipates
into
a
fairly
consistent
thin
skim
with
one
large
dollop
of
foam
that
coalesced
in
the
center
clarity
was
a
little
hazymurky
nose
is
big
sweet
raspberries
and
a
suggestion
of
artificial
sweetener
taste
is
really
salty
at
the
start
followed
by
raspberries
and
some
tartness
however
the
tartness
is
masked
by
the
saltiness
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
the
saltiness
really
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
carbonation
is
very
lively
and
falls
just
short
of
being
prickly
this
is
a
really
interesting
and
multifaceted
beer
i
cant
believe
how
salty
it
was
im
curious
to
see
how
this
one
ages
d
im
really
glad
i
have
another
one
to
crack
i
may
have
to
hide
it
from
the
wifey
though
she
said
it
was
one
of
her
favorites
to
date
i
would
suggest
that
you
seek
it
out
if
u
havent
tried
it
yet
i
also
have
heard
that
they
have
a
tendency
to
gush
i
served
mine
extremely
cold
and
didnt
have
an
issue
drinkability
i
had
this
one
at
a
4
0
by
virtue
of
its
low
abv
but
i
think
the
high
level
of
acidity
hurts
this
one
slightly
its
just
a
little
intense
and
though
the
nose
starts
off
as
inviting
and
interesting
it
ultimately
gets
a
little
harsh
too
acidic
and
a
little
too
onedimensional
in
the
flavor
profile
worth
trying
this
beer
was
sampled
out
of
a
reidel
stemless
red
wine
glass
overall
very
tasty
and
will
look
forward
to
this
beer
each
year
looking
forward
to
getting
a
chance
to
try
the
double
raspberry
version
this
was
incredibly
drinkable
and
undoubtedly
the
best
raspberry
beer
ive
ever
had
thanks
jmbsh
pours

raspberries
very
good
not
unbelievable
appropriate
though
still
above
average
carbonation
that
caused
the
gushing
and
a
very
good
drinker
overall
another
great
sour
from
tomme
arthur
mouthfeel
is
medium

and
carbonation
is
high
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
nice
sour
beer
it
was
sourer
then
i
expected
which
i
considered
a
good
thing
the
raspberries
also
added
a
nice
flavor
that
aided
in
the
drinkability
factor
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
a
lot
beer
is
thin
and
smooth
it
finishes
dry
and
has
a
strong
tartness
in
the
corners
of
my
mouth
strongly
lactic
in
the
mouth
some
acetic
character
a
very
drinkable
and
wonderful
sour
overall
d
quite
tasty
though
not
nearly
as
complex
as
some
really
outstanding
wild
ales
way
overpriced
very
happy
with
this
beer
from
lost
abbey
while
overall
not
being
a
huge
lost
abbey
fan
this
one
was
spot
on
in
all
categories
good
have
looked
a
bit
better
though
d
a
solid
beer
but
probably
not
the
same
as
when
i
experienced
this
one
at
ebf
much
better
as
it
warms
this
one
takes
on
a
whole
new
flavor
profile
and
character
as
well
as
body
definitely
worth
a
try
d
tartness
is
superb
but
not
palate
destroying
the
fruit
character
is
very
refreshing
and
damn
its
just
an
enjoyable
beer
d
good
tasty
beer
i
am
glad
i
have
more
this
is
amazing
i
love
it
the
raspberry
flavor
is
heavy
but
never
too
much
great
beer
but
im
really
pissed
about
the
mess
and
loss
of
beer
its
bad
enough
i
have
to
stay
away
from
lost
abbey
big
ba
beers
now
i
have
to
fear
the
wild
ales
too
for
the
opposite
reason
d
this
is
a
really
good
raspberry
wild
overall
more
sour
in
the
back
and
more
sweet
upfront
another
great
well
put
together
brew
by
the
lost
abbey
d
fairly
good
dont
really
pick
up
on
any
alcohol
but
its
so
tart
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
more
than
1
or
2
dthis
has
a
huge
sourness
and
tons
of
raspberry
flavors
the
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
the
sourness
is
quite
nice
both
are
huge
375
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
with
a
very
suggestive
label
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
redbrownorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
strong
raspberries
the
flavor
is
strong
raspberry
with
low
to
medium
tartness
very
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
intensely
tart
mouthpuckering
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
earthy
and
acidic
funk
balanced
out
by
a
sweet
dark
raspberry
fruit
flavor
as
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
very
strong
funky
sour
tartness
with
a
slight
lactic
presence
and
decent
amount
of
earthy
oak
from
the
barrel
aging
this
beer
is
still
young
so
the
raspberries
are
prominent
adding
a
sweet
yet
still
tart
balance
and
another
level
of
complexity
soft
carbonation
throughout
as
well
as
a
slight
syrupy
texture
adds
some
thicknessfullness
to
the
body
but
the
bone
dry
intensely
puckering
finish
leaves
me
salivating
for
another
sip
only
slightly
acidic
and
extremely
quaffable
again
this
beer
is
young
so
the
fruit
is
still
prominent
but
with
some
age
this
is
going
to
develop
into
a
monster
very
similar
to
a
belgian
lambic
in
aroma
and
flavor
complex
and
delicious
and
one
of
lost
abbeys
best
beers
to
date
highly
recommended
approach
this
with
caution
d
i
never
wanted
it
to
end
simple
as
that
thank
you
lost
abbey
d
an
excellent
easydrinking
wild
ale
highly
enjoyable
and
quite
restrained
in
the
abv
and
palatedestruction
departments
i
easily
enjoyed
a
375ml
bottle
on
my
own
and
i
could
have
had
another
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
d
great
easy
to
drink
and
very
crisp
i
wish
i
had
2
bottles
because
this
brew
would
probably
age
well
drinkability
is
a
little
down
its
very
sour
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
something
that
is
this
exceptionally
sour
the
sourness
fades
quickly
enough
that
it
does
not
keep
you
from
drinking
it
all
d
this
was
great
i
can
only
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
bottles
someday
possibly
the
best
lost
abbey
beer
ive
ever
had
44
54
544
5
hell
of
a
beer
overall
another
good
sour
from
a
brewery
that
can
at
least
be
counted
on
to
get
those
right
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
wild
ale
la
really
seems
to
nail
this
style
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
beer
i
think
it
is
going
to
get
very
mouth
puckering
tart
great
drinkability
as
well
this
beer
goes
down
very
delightfully
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
wild
ale
lots
of
tart
sour
and
fruity
flavors
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
do
it
but
this
would
make
an
awesome
sorbet
for
those
that
have
extra
bottles
to
play
around
with
the
375ml
bottle
isnt
enough
a
full
750ml
bottle
would
be
just
about
right
the
7
0
alcohol
is
not
at
all
noticeable
excellent
sour
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
mouthfeel
is
a
little
more
substantial
that
i
may
have
expected
lowmedium
level
of
carbonation
is
on
point
great
beer
very
pleasant
and
successful
in
what
it
was
trying
to
be
theres
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
besides
the
punching
raspberry
flavor
and
it
is
kind
of
one
dimensional
in
that
sense
but
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
ill
be
drinking
the
rest
of
my
bottles
within
the
next
6
months
or
sooner
i
cant
see
this
getting
any
better
thanks
for
the
chance
d
this
is
the
reason
i
joined
the
sinners
club
this
year
and
it
lived
up
to
everything
i
wanted
it
to
the
asgc
was
amazing
and
this
is
just
sort
of
the
cherry
to
top
it
off
im
happy
i
bought
my
max
allotment
and
would
buy
even
more
given
the
oppertunity
drinkability
pretty
damned
tasty
brew
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
has
a
fairly
nice
balance
between
the
sour
raspberries
and
wood
but
i
really
love
the
big
vanilla
aspect
that
mixes
with
the
fruit
now
to
just
get
them
to
put
it
in
750s
thanks
much
corey
d
high
i
love
this
beer
kind
of
pissed
at
the
start
from
the
explosion
but
by
the
end
i
have
a
smile
on
my
face
this
beer
is
fantastic
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
awesome
nose
and
a
good
taste
to
this
beer
make
it
quite
enjoyable
eventually
i
decided
to
agitate
the
beer
aggressively
to
help
dispel
some
of
the
carbonation
i
noticed
an
improvement
in
the
flavor
profile
however
i
still
felt
that
the
mustiness
overwhelmed
the
sourness
and
fruit
a
bit
too
much
this
one
needs
some
work
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
heavy
carbonation
is
an
obvious
overreaction
to
the
many
flat
lost
abbey
bottles
of
2009
that
said
and
although
there
is
a
long
road
ahead
this
is
a
great
step
forward
for
american
breweries
in
terms
of
lambicframboise
style
beers
american
wild
ale
may
no
longer
be
enough
d
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
this
bottle
on
my
own
tonight
this
may
be
the
best
i
have
had
from
lost
abbey
in
terms
of
fruite
beers
ever
maybe
it
was
just
me
but
i
have
never
had
something
that
worked
for
me
so
well
with
this
rich
flavor
cannot
say
enough
good
things
here
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
punchy
carbonation
good
body
and
overall
quite
the
tasty
brew
of
all
the
new
lost
abbey
beers
ive
had
this
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
worth
seeking
this
one
out
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
framboise
no
gusher
on
this
bottle
although
the
cork
was
a
bit
of
a
pain
to
get
out
d
after
the
first
sip
my
initial
thought
was
i
wish
this
was
a
750ml
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
a
tasty
beer
glad
i
have
some
more
if
youre
a
fan
of
wild
ales
you
will
be
very
impressed
with
the
framboise
reminds
me
of
the
consecration
but
aged
with
raspberries
added
instead
of
currants
pinkish
brown
pour
raspberries
yeast
funk
and
brown
malt
in
the
nose
and
raspberries
brett
oak
and
sour
cherry
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
really
close
to
as
good
as
it
gets
for
the
style
but
having
plenty
of
tommes
other
sours
i
can
say
it
could
be
a
touch
smoother
you
will
want
another
one
the
lingering
dryness
combined
with
the
tart
sour
character
of
the
beer
will
have
you
thirsting
for
seconds
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
slightly
syrupy
heftiness
to
the
finish
ill
say
this
is
highly
drinkable
because
i
wanted
more
at
the
end
of
the
glass
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
really
soon
i
cant
imagine
this
would
age
well
all
of
its
flavor
is
from
the
fruit
which
would
likley
fade
with
time
and
lead
to
the
plain
tasting
base
beer
drinkability
this
would
be
a
very
difficult
brew
for
me
to
cellar
as
it
is
so
ready
to
drink
right
now
and
that
being
said
the
liquid
in
my
glass
is
flying
the
hell
out
outstanding
world
class
nuff
said
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
i
think
i
will
have
to
a
trip
up
to
the
brewery
to
get
some
more
bottles
a
seven
ounce
pour
of
this
is
a
5
on
drinkability
but
the
acidity
makes
a
full
bottle
somewhat
laborious
its
a
chest
burner
still
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
undeniably
excellent
this
is
one
hell
of
a
framboise
d
im
usually
not
the
hugest
fan
of
the
framboise
variety
of
lambicsour
beers
but
this
was
a
really
pleasant
and
refreshing
take
on
it
had
another
bottle
tonight
if
anything
i
underrated
this
on
my
first
review
maybe
due
to
old
ill
feelings
really
a
splendid
beer
all
in
all
a
fine
entry
and
one
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
both
from
the
tap
at
the
brewery
and
in
the
six
bottles
i
was
able
to
pick
up
at
the
release
event
d
i
would
drink
this
anytime
i
see
it
draft
city
beer
store
this
beer
is
a
darkish
pink
with
no
head
and
looks
thick
like
a
cross
between
pepto
and
the
dregs
of
a
fruit
beer
the
aroma
is
pretty
great
theres
huge
raspberry
note
backed
by
a
clean
lactic
sourness
its
fresh
and
natural
smelling
no
artificial
fruit
here
it
reminds
me
of
making
raspberry
jam
the
flavor
is
almost
harshly
tart
and
lactic
sour
which
i
enjoy
but
probably
isnt
for
everyone
the
mouthfeel
seems
thick
but
i
could
be
imagining
that
the
beer
is
fairly
palette
wrecking
pleasingly
so
at
first
but
it
wore
on
me
the
lactic
tart
raspberry
was
strong
enough
to
make
me
almost
lose
the
flavor
by
the
end
of
my
small
glass
very
interesting
and
rather
delicious
beer
particularly
in
small
doses
murky
reddishpurple
in
the
glass
with
a
small
white
head
that
settles
to
little
more
than
a
film
huge
tart
raspberry
aroma
backed
by
very
clean
lactic
sourness
i
could
accuse
this
of
being
onedimensional
but
the
fruit
character
is
amazing
tart
raspberries
are
equally
dominant
on
the
palate
with
the
perfect
level
of
lactic
sourness
backing
it
finishes
with
a
trace
of
woody
astringency
but
very
clean
on
the
whole
simple
straightforward
and
beautifully
crafted
this
is
what
lindemans
framboise
would
taste
like
if
it
were
dry
and
sour
and
good
o
very
fruit
forward
sour
that
drinks
pretty
easy
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
collar
nice
thick
gobs
of
lacing
despite
the
subdued
head
the
scent
is
full
of
tropical
fruits
as
well
as
peach
very
fresh
scent
upon
tasting
the
initial
fruity
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
crisp
tart
and
acidic
finish
not
a
full
on
sour
bomb
but
it
is
there
and
very
enjoyable
wonderful
lingering
flavor
of
a
slightly
sweet
mango
lively
carbonation
and
light
bodied
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
sour
ale
that
is
likely
to
be
best
fresh
pours
a
nice
amber
orange
smells
a
bit
strange
due
to
the
dry
hopped
sour
very
crisp
really
enjoy
this
taste
as
the
sourness
is
mild
and
the
hops
mesh
well
not
as
big
a
fan
of
dry
hopped
sours
as
i
thought
i
would
be
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
though
pours
a
cloudy
dark
golden
color
with
a
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
mild
has
that
belgium
yeast
sour
aroma
slightly
fruity
the
taste
is
excellent
bready
at
first
but
quickly
hits
you
with
a
sour
fruity
blast
leaves
that
sour
taste
on
your
palate
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
o
4
25
an
excellent
example
of
a
dryhopped
sour
neither
the
hops
nor
the
sour
flavors
are
too
aggressive
all
very
balanced
and
refreshing
with
enough
going
on
that
keeps
you
interested
tasty
unique
beer
sweet
and
sour
with
a
pleasantly
astringent
and
floral
dry
hopped
flavor
pours
a
hazy
light
copper
color
and
has
an
aroma
that
matches
the
taste
on
tap
at
najas
pours
hazy
orange
with
no
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
sour
tropical
fruits
vinegar
and
a
little
funk
taste
is
initially
sour
peach
and
mango
settling
to
a
slightly
spicy
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
low
to
mid
carbonation
dry
and
a
little
sticky
this
smells
like
an
ipa
and
tastes
like
an
ipa
thats
a
little
sour
overall
a
really
good
beer
beautiful
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
white
and
lasting
effervescent
and
a
bit
of
haze
mine
aroma
is
enticing
sour
notes
but
much
more
woodmfruit
and
an
undercurrent
of
hops
the
taste
is
spot
on
lots
of
up
front
sourness
but
it
isnt
overpowering
huge
lemon
and
grapefruit
flavor
wood
some
balance
and
a
little
grain
finish
is
tart
and
clean
great
nice
hop
still
sour
notes
clean
finish
le
terroir
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
small
swirling
head
there
is
a
big
aroma
big
grapefruit
notes
with
hints
of
peach
and
hops
the
taste
is
very
sour
nice
grapefruit
flavors
hints
of
peach
nice
body
nice
feel
overall
its
a
big
sour
fruity
beer
little
too
sour
for
me
overall
really
good
stuff
hops
play
really
well
against
the
beers
sourness
and
provide
lots
of
flavor
and
aroma
while
not
really
adding
any
bitterness
definitely
worth
trying
it
was
so
good
on
tap
had
to
go
buy
a
few
bottles
o
i
havent
had
much
of
a
chance
to
get
into
sours
but
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
many
points
for
originality
here
exceptional
flavor
profile
as
well
and
very
well
balanced
its
kind
of
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
sour
blond
ale
im
happy
to
say
its
a
good
combo
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
prost
incredibly
refreshing
and
punchy
not
overly
bitter
has
a
nice
lingering
finish
similar
to
blood
orange
expensive
in
portland
or
at
15
a
22oz
o
not
a
big
sour
beer
drinker
but
the
are
growing
on
me
this
one
has
some
great
aroma
but
most
of
the
taste
is
a
strong
sour
pretty
solid
sour
and
the
hops
add
a
nice
complexity
overall
its
nothing
amazing
and
not
worth
the
15
price
tag
for
a
dry
hop
ipa
id
rather
have
a
red
swingline
this
was
delicious
decent
sourtart
pucker
as
well
as
the
bright
notes
from
the
dryhopping
as
i
sat
with
my
buddy
trying
this
one
we
agreed
that
this
would
be
an
awesome
brew
to
try
and
clone
and
that
it
would
be
a
great
house
beer
i
am
new
to
sours
and
this
convinced
me
to
take
a
further
plunge
lips
of
faith
series
rocks
single
pint
bomber
poured
into
a
tulip
a
sparkling
dark
orange
with
two
fingers
of
sudsy
rocky
white
foam
aroma
is
initially
innocent
enough
some
orange
and
lemon
rinds
but
blooms
into
some
pretty
serious
sour
funk
with
a
fruity
flair
full
of
sour
mangoes
green
apples
peaches
white
grapes
limes
vinegar
lemon
juice
a
massive
sour
gummy
candy
bouquet
with
just
a
hint
of
barnyard
on
the
palate
the
hops
seem
to
accent
rather
than
dominate
tons
of
sour
fruit
muscat
grapes
lemonlime
those
sour
tangerines
that
are
full
of
seeds
and
green
mango
super
acidic
and
corrosive
again
with
little
true
funk
in
the
old
style
fiercely
carbonated
as
well
like
a
sparkling
wine
getting
more
hops
on
the
nose
late
quite
floral
a
subtle
sweetness
like
a
pina
colada
lurks
underneath
body
on
the
light
side
but
not
watery
or
thin
per
se
im
still
branching
out
into
sour
beer
territory
but
this
burgeoning
fan
deems
this
an
instant
classic
with
creamy
one
finger
thick
white
head
medium
bodied
hopping
and
tartness
are
well
integrated

but
to
me
this
is
what
they
should
be
all
about
its
got
some
nice
hop
flavors
and
some
really
nice
hop
aromas
with
out
adding
bitterness
which
i

would
really
clash
with
the

but
i
am
loving
it
as
my
glass
warms
and
my
mouth
gets
accustomed
to
the
sourness
more
oak
and
apricots
show
up
along
with
a
vinious
flavor
not
overly
dry
and
well
carbonated
makes
me
thirsty
for
more
without
raking
my
tongue
id
be
interested
to
taste
a
fresher
bottle
but
this
2011
is
right
up
my
alley
everything
i
want
in
a
fruited
sour
is
here
fantastic
beer
and
a
wonderful
introduction
to
cascade
verdict
a
very
nice
wild
ale
from
cascade
perhaps
a
bit
simple
but
the
balance
is
nice
plenty
of
apricot
as
advertised
but
aside
from
the
bits
of
funk
and
malt
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
that
being
said
this
was
extremely
refreshing
and
very
enjoyable
to
drink
on
a
relaxing
afternoon
o
ive
never
fallen
for
a
sour
while
i
can
appreciate
a
good
gueuze
im
never
in
the
mood
for
one
this
might
change
that
i
already
want
another
o
overall
this
is
very
solid
the
perfect
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
going
to
garner
a
very
high
overall
score
but
the
smell
will
knock
it
down
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
out
of
this
one
cascade
blueberry
is
one
of
my
most
favorite
brews
and
i
think
i
had
such
high
expectations
for
apricot
that
it
almost
isnt
fair
to
review
it
on
my
first
time
having
it
during
the
early
parts
of
this
review
i
was
sort
of
bashing
it
a
bit
because
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
expectations
but
now
that
ive
been
drinking
through
more
of
it
it
is
really
growing
on
me
id
definitely
drink
it
again
and
will
probably
buy
another
one
to
try
to
have
it
in
a
less
biased
situation
but
i
wouldnt
see
myself
shelling
out
30bottle
for
it
on
a
regular
basis
in
the
end
it
misses
the
sourness
i
was
expecting
while
wowing
me
with
lots
of
fruit
that
isnt
too
sweet
or
dry

balance

i
found
this
beer
to
be
outstanding
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
wanted
more
o
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
as
its
so
highly
rated
the
apricot
character
did
not
come
through
to
the
extent
id
have
liked
o
delicious

this
is
delicious
stuff
yet
again
from
cascade
with
a
great
take
on
a
type
of
sour
that
more
of
the
big
guys
that
make
these
kinds
of
beers
right
should
experiment
with
theres
something
really
appropriate
about
using
apricots
for
sour
beers
its
naturally
acidic
dry
and
tart
character
melds
so
naturally
at
hand
im
happy
to
have
another
bottle
on
hand
that
ive
held
onto
since
july
i
should
consider
cracking
it
open
soon
before
the
highlighted

beer
i
dont
think
it
packs
the
complexity
of
a
fou
foune
but
it
certainly
beats
out
many
other
lesser
imitations
the
apricot
flavor
is
pure
and
authentic
tasting
and
the
balance
of
fruit
and
sour
is
almost
perfect

overall
its
probably
my
favorite
out
of
a
limited
sampling
of
cascade
beers
what
minor
shortcomings
it
has
in
look
and
smell
it
more
than
makes
up
for
with
a
fantastic
taste
and
a
nice
invigorating
mouthfeel
as
one
of
the
more
reasonablypriced
cascade
beers
its
one
im
likely
to
try
to
get
my
hands
on
again
outstanding
stuff
i
really
enjoyed
the
look
of
this
beer
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
tons
of
bubbly
white
head
that
stayed
throughout
me
drinking
i
would
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
still
have
some
of
that
sticky
bubbles
at
the
bottom
each
new
pour
brought
more
beer
and
lots
more
bubbles
a
great
peachyorangyamberyyellowy
color
that
i
found
extremely
inviting
aroma
was
a
bit
lackluster
citrusy
acidic
tartness
with
some
faint
apricot
taste
was
a
punch
in
the
mouth
sour
i
found
my
mouth
watering
from
the
aftertaste
really
dry
super
tart
and
great
balanced
fruitiness
apricotkumquat
with
some
mild
woodyspiciness
this
beer
literally
danced
around
my
tongue
and
had
a
nice
light
body
without
being
watery
an
absolutely
gorgeous
beer
totally
brings
cascade
into
my
most
desired
breweries
list
thanks
to
my
twin
brother
for
making
this
happen
somehow
understated
pale
yellow
color
to
this
with
an
active
rising
white
bubbly
head
but
its
the
nose
that
hooks
me
hard
it
smells
like
fresh
apricot
really
and
truly
the
most
authentic
fruit
nose
ever
its
perfect
i
smell
the
little
fuzzies
the
juicy
flesh
the
pollen
the
woody
pit
all
of
it
its
genius
it
has
got
some
lactic
funk
too
and
its
dry
and
just
making
my
mouth
water
like
nothing
else
superb
smell
best
i
can
recall
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
fluently
apricot
still
head
and
shoulders
more
genuine
than
any
other
apricot
beer
ive
had
but
its
not
quite
as
in
my
face
as
the
aroma
tart
as
anything
too
from
the
yeast
and
bugs
its
funky
summery
desserty
like
smuckers
apricot
jam
its
got
all
that
sugar
but
doesnt
really
taste
sweet
thats
the
brilliance
of
this
brew
great
carbonation
and
a
really
intense
sour
prickle
more
than
i
can
almost
take
dries
me
right
out
too
i
cant
get
enough
in
a
night
packed
with
world
class
sours
this
was
perhaps
my
favorite
its
authentic
fruit
and
tart
acidity
make
a
great
combination
i
would
love
to
drink
this
again
incredible
beer
overall
one
of
cascades
best
love
it
and
have
returned
to
it
many
times
as
mentioned
before
the
flavour
components
are
all
there
in
its
full
glory
its
not
a
subtle
beer
where
everything
interacts
with
each
other
well
but
rather
it
is
a
brash
beer
that
is
tart
sweet
sour
acidic
and
funky
all
at
the
same
time
but
it
is
not
particularly
complex
in
all
the
jumble
a
bit
of
the
essence
of
this
beer
is
lost
perhaps
some
time
will
do
it
good
o
the
sourness
on
this
beer
seemed
to
overwhelm
some
of
the
great
flavors
that
i
am
sure
are
hidden
underneath
i
just
didnt
get
much
complexity
that
i
would
expect
for
a
beer
that
spent
so
much
time
in
the
barrel
overall
excellent
the
best
cascade
sour
ive
had
the
nose
has
some
light
apricot
smell
very
fresh
smelling
and
bright
some
lemony
tartness
on
the
nose
as
well
the
beer
is
a
hazy
peach
color
and
reminds
of
apricots
the
taste
is
like
a
fresh
unripened
apricot
after
having
other
cascade
offerings
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
apricot
flavor
to
shine
through
it
was
quite
acidic
but
the
finish
was
nice
unripened
apricot
o
pricy
but
well
worth
a
try
great
to
see
a
beer
like
this
produced
in
the
us
o
definitely
a
hefty
sourness
with
subtle
oaky
fruits
but
i
dig
it
every
cascade
sour
ive
encountered
has
been
great
but
this
is
extra
great
stupidly
tart
gloriously
sour
and
interestingly
fruity
this
is
a
gem
this
is
about
as
complex
a
wild
as
ive
encountered
from
a
us
brewery
massively
fruity
and
as
tart
as
they
come
ill
be
picking
it
up
every
time
i
see
it
absolutely
world
class
t
opens
with
a
big
sour
kick
in
the
teeth
sharp
lemon
bite
tart
apricot
and
green
apple
and
a
ton
of
lactic
sourness
theres
a
hit
of
dryness
on
the
finish
that
seems
to
suck
the
moisture
right
out
of
your
mouth
once
the
dryness
fades
i
get
a
lingering
jammy
apricot
note
with
some
underripe
cherry
and
oak
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
come
across
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
o
the
appearance
and
nose
of
this
beer
is
underwhelming
but
the
taste
is
simply
divine
its
really
a
perfectly
balanced
sour
acetic
without
being
overpowering
the
fruit
and
oak
delicately
balanced
on
the
tongue
if
youre
expecting
a
fruit
beer
with
tons
of
apricot
character
youll
be
disappointed
for
all
other
sourheads
highly
recommended
i
guess
i
will
be
the
exception
here
i
and
the
others
at
my
place
thought
this
was
just
awful
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
apple
cider
vinegar
with
no
apricot
to
be
found
i
have
had
and
enjoyed
a
few
of
the
other
cascade
projects
but
this
was
just
not
drinkable
imo
it
fizzed
in
my
sink
like
a
cleaning
product
would
o
solid
apricot
sour
that
balances
the
tartness
and
fruit
flavor
well
overall
enjoyable
but
really
sour
which
masks
any
complexity
it
has
a
passive
taste
doesnt
reveal
all
of
the
flavors
pricy
but
this
is
the
real
deal
not
often
do
you
get
to
see
an
apricot
wild
ale
and
this
pulls
it
off
with
flying
colors
it
was
a
fresh
batch
and
it
showed
each
sip
just
reminds
me
of
biting
into
a
super
ripe
apricot
and
other
similar
pitted
fruits
so
flavorful
and
the
tart
wild
aspect
of
the
beer
just
tops
it
off
to
become
a
truly
great
brew
maybe
the
best
beer
i
have
had
this
year
some
people
seem
to
not
get
the
apricot
much
but
this
bottle
was
fantastic
overall
just
a
straightup
solid
apricot
sour
id
use
this
as
a
standard
for
all
other
apricot
ales
i
wonder
if
its
just
as
good
fresh
i
believe
its
on
par
with
bruerys
sitr
kumquats
perfect
on
a
sunny
summer
day
overall
after
sang
noir
this
is
my
next
favorite
cascade
sour
better
than
figaor
noyeaux
sang
royal
strawberry
blueberry
i
have
a
second
one
and
ill
be
drinking
it
fresh
to
make
sure
its
as
good
as
this
one
well
done
cascade
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
drinks
so
easily
only
drawback
is
the
price
worth
considering
a
move
closer
to
the
barrel
house
overall
this
was
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
for
me
for
the
price
tag
though
im
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
ive
probably
had
about
a
dozen
sour
beers
at
this
point
and
i
kind
of
consider
it
the
last
beer
frontier
for
me
within
the
style
its
probably
the
best
ive
had
or
close
to
it
if
you
dont
like
sour
beer
or
have
never
had
it
before
im
not
so
sure
this
would
convert
you
though
or
at
least
i
wouldnt
take
the
chance
for
the
steep
price
tag
overall
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
this
is
a
wellcrafted
apricot
sour
being
my
first
beer
from
cascade
i
am
very
impressed
and
will
definitely
seek
out
more
from
them
o
a
very
good
sour
ale
the
fruit
isnt
overwhelming
but
instead
compliments
the
acidity
very
well
o
very
nice
beer
you
know
its
a
cascade
sour
and
you
know
it
was
brewed
with
apricots
can
you
really
ask
for
anything
more
id
love
to
get
me
hands
on
a
few
more
bottles
and
drink
this
a
few
times
a
year
overall
a
simply
stunning
beer
this
is
fairly
close
to
perfect
id
like
to
see
just
a
tad
more
complexity
in
the
smell
otherwise
theres
not
much
that
can
be
done
to
improve
this
beer
like
most
of
the
cascade
fruit
wilds
the
added
fruit
does
not
add
much
the
kriek
being
the
exception
still
a
worthwhile
sour
all
around
this
is
really
a
fantastic
beer
the
flavors
are
great
fruity
juicy
quenching
tart
mildly
funky
oaky
complex
and
refined
really
my
only
large
complaint
is
the
fact
that
your
stomach
might
have
an
easier
time
handling
battery
acid
than
this
stuff
although
im
not
ready
to
blame
my
entire
abdominal
agony
on
this
beer
since
it
wasnt
the
only
sour
of
the
night
you
could
definitely
feel
each
sip
as
it
went
down
but
theres
no
doubt
that
id
gladly
suffer
for
this
one
again
its
far
too
tasty
to
pass
up
overall
impression
havent
done
a
review
in
a
while
so
when
i
popped
this
one
thought
it
would
be
a
good
one
to
start
back
on
super
sour
and
has
a
great
apricot
background
highly
recommend
this
one
and
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
another
one
of
these
in
the
near
future
trade
anyone
overall
this
stuff
is
really
good
cascade
really
and
for
good
reason
is
dominating
the
american
sour
scene
with
this
being
another
cornerstone
in
that
foundation
something
id
drink
again
but
i
know
its
not
cheap
pretty
stoked
i
have
the
blueberry
version
to
look
forward
too
o
home
run
really
great
first
run
at
cascades
sours
if
you
like
apricots
you
will
love
this
4
5
a
barrel
aged
apricot
wild
ale
you
know
that
wont
come
cheap
you
have
to
open
your
wallet
a
little
wider
if
you
want
to
try
a
beer
like
this
was
it
worth
it
id
say
its
the
price
im
saying
that
because
i
enjoy
this
style
in
the
end
this
was
a
very
good
sour
and
tart
fruit
based
wild
ale
it
was
nice
to
see
that
the
oak
doesnt
take
over
the
taste
it
was
the
apricot
that
ruled
over
this
taste
the
beer
stays
true
to
its
name
o
sours
are
not
my
chalice
of
tea
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
took
me
a
while
to
drink
but
still
yummy
cheers
d
great
wild
ale
the
apricots
are
nice
and
tart
and
the
overall
beer
well
balanced
o
once
again
cascade
doesnt
disappoint
my
favorite
offering
from
them
to
date
the
apricot
in
this
one
is
perfect
o
this
beer
has
very
nice
amounts
of
sourness
and
tartness
but
neither
of
these
are
over
the
top
and
are
somewhat
balanced
off
by
the
apricots
o
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
very
well
hidden
almost
dangerously
so
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
sourness
and
tartness
so
it
is
not
a
fast
drinking
or
sessionable
beer
but
is
very
enjoyable
i
would
be
happy
to
find
this
one
again
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
pour
that
got
hazier
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
a
somewhat
aggressive
pour
yielded
a
large
foamy
cap
of
white
head
that
settled
down
to
a
thick
collar
leaving
quicklyreceded
lacing
on
the
glass
tart
lactic
aroma
apricot
and
pear
this
obviously
followed
through
into
the
taste
with
the
tart
apricot
pretty
much
dominating
all
with
a
biscuity
malt
base
detectable
pretty
sour
i
must
say
this
followed
an
upland
blackberry
and
pretty
much
nuked
my
palate
even
after
that
one
a
woody

emerged
later
getting
more
pronounced

of

quite
good
overall

not
something
id
drink
regularly
i
definitely
needed
an
antacid
after
this
and
the
upland
o
another
well
crafted
fruit
sour
from
cascade
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
should
satisfy
anyone
who
likes
sour
fruit
ales
this
one
doesnt
have
much
contribution
from
the
barrel
but
i
dont
care
because
it
tastes
great
the
pour

i
am
extremely
impressed
it
is

and
great

i
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
can
get
it
the
combination
of
twelve
months
in
oak
followed
by
ten
months
on
apricots
did
wonders
for
this
fruit
flavored
sour
ale
not
only
was
it
complex
and
remarkably
unique
but
also
incredibly
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
was
well
worth
the
steep
price
of
admission
and
would
make
a
fantastic
warm
weather
treat
if
i
have
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
again
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
if
the
apricot
flavor
is
more
apparent

very

a

overall
i
think
i
just
wanted

the
dry

is
pretty
awesome
good

a
phenomenal

it
was
not

was

this
does
not
detract
from
it
at

amazing

low

a
generally
dont

apricot
wasnt

i
loved

will
be
seeking
it
out
again
thanks
neel
cascade
you
are
doing
it
right
medium

decent

dry
and
lasting
on

this
might
be
my
favorite
wild
ale
from

next
to
vlad
this
is
an
excellent
flavorful
brew
with
great
tartness
and
slight
apricot
sweetness
that
plays
well
with
some

and

apricot
is
a
nice
orange
hued
beer
with
some
spots
of
faded
gold
within
the
liquid
the
cap
was
about
an
inch
in
height
and
off
white
in
height
it
dwindles
eventually
into
nothing
leaving
no
stick
on
the
glass
after
a
while
the
liquid
looks
kind
of
dead
smell
is
of
fresh
apricot
pith
this
is
an
extremely
fresh
bottle
that
just
touched
down
in
philly
not
sure
how
long
it
was
in
the
bottle
before
i
opened
it
immediately
warmed
up
apricot
pale
malt
some
lactic
quailty
and
no
alcohol
its
a
pleasant
smell
just
not
all
together
bold
taste
is
pretty
balanced
expecting
a
sour
bomb
i
am
greeted
by
fresh
apricot
orange
pale
malt
french
oak
and
some
lactic
funk
the
wood
shows
up
more
towards
warming
with
orange
popping
out
as
well
melding
in
with
the
apricot
feel
is
a
step
below
medium
the
funk
and
apricot
hit
the
tounge
and
leave
off
with
light
malt
and
lactic
twinges
carb
is
surprisingly
low
but
i
guess
that
works
with
the
acidic
nature
of
cascade
which
is
heavy
on
the
lactoacidic
nature
of
their
sours
while
not
all
that
extremely
sour
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
that
i
think
others
could
open
up
to
especially
girls
o
overall
this
was
a
delicious
beer
albeit
at
a
steep
price
point
wish
i
could
drink
stuff
like
this
more
oftenthroughout
the
year
excellent
job
from
cascade
overall

apricot
ale
was
a
wonderful
introduction
to
cascade
brewing
it
is
a
great
spin
on
sour
ale
everything
about
this
beerits
appearance
smell
taste
and
mouthfeelis
stellar
the
noholdsbarred
tartness
and
beautifully
effervescent
slightly
puckering
mouthfeel
really
won
me
over
if
you
like
sour
ales
and
havent
tried
any
brews
by
cascade
you
must
do
so
post
haste
o
this
beer
is
delicious
great
balance
between
sweetness
and
tartness
with
an
awesome
mouthfeel
awesome
very
potent
stuff
excellent
sourness
with
big
juicy
fruits
very
easy
drinking
and
complex
yummers
what
a
fantastic
exception
if
you
cant
have
fou
foune
i
love
the
fact
this
is
made
in
america
would
love
to
have
this
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
refreshing
beer
insanely
drinkable
for
its
high
abv
i
happen
to
love
welldone
fruit
sours
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
this
is
where
i
eschew
objectivity
and
just
say
that
this
is
a
beer
that
really
works
for
me
love
it
o
a
delicious
beer
one
of
the
better
american
sours
ive
had
recently
excellent
allaround
d
second
best
apricot
notes
ive
had
im
not
convinced
that
this
specific
fruit
really
shines
in
the
drink
of
any
sourwild
still
a
good
brew
here
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
if
it
werent
so
pricey
i
would
grab
a
bunch
of
it
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
an
amber
hue
with
a
decent
amount
of
hops
somewhat
cloudy
in
appearance
aroma
is
very
fruity
as
would
be
expected
with
apricot
lemon
and
some
earthiness
some
funk
in
there
as
well
flavor
is
an
excellent
combo
of
sweet
and
sour
more
sour
than
sweet
but
a
surprising
amount
of
fruit
and
some
malt
as
well
balance
out
the
sourness
very
well
nice
citrus
notes
as
well
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
my
favorite
in
this
style
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
tart
pitted
fruit
with
a
solid
shot
of
funk
the
nose
is
full
of
citrus
and
lactic
aromas
the
flavor
is
quite
tart
and
acidic
a
solid
shot
of
lemons
and
sweet
tarts
with
some
light
tart
fruit
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
sneaky
bit
of
oak
and
vanilla
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
lactic
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
nice
sour
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
on
the
night
before
hurricane
sandy
2011
project
apricot
always
was
one
of
my
favorite
jolly
rancher
flavors
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mildly
hazy
goldenbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
apricot
jam
tangerine
zest
mandarin
orange
lemon
zest
and
a
vague
sense
of
sweetening
spices
way
in
the
background
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lactic
peach
funky
wheat
and
lemon
flesh
its
a
bit
simpler
than
the
nose
but
tasty
and
effective
nonetheless
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
fruity
sour
one
i
really
wish
i
could
try
over
and
over
again
good
times
o
overall
a
great
beer
i
loved
this
one
the
tripel
base
morphed
into
a
sour
lambic
is
my
kind
of
beer
great
complexity
and
depth
amazing
aroma
and
great
palate
profile
well
done
clearly
another
great
offering
from
the
gang
at

pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
some
peach
and
apricot
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
super
drinkable
o
ive
yet
to
be
anything
less
than
blown
away
by
everything
ive
had
from
cascade
granted
i
havent
had
any
of
their
nonsour
beers
this
beer
is
delicious
and
since
it
is
damn
near
impossible
to
cop
some
fou
foune
around
these
parts
this
is
a
worthy
substitute
and
every
bit
as
good
in
my
opinion
m
light
bodied
dry
finish
murky
orange
with
a
billowing
white
head
thats
transient
and
fades
to
a
white
ring
with

some
blond

leanings
with

medium

which
gives
impression
of
a

thats
higher
than
it
is
more
apricot
flavour
here
than
fou
foune
i
thought
but
doesnt
hold
that
same
kind
of
funk
that
the
cantillon
provides
superior
in
fruit
flavour
inmy
mind
though
a
fantastic
fruited
sour
overall
another
tasty
sour
from
cascade
so
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
cant
stop
taking
another
sip
hazy
copper
orange
pour
with
a
huge
plume
of
fluffy
white
head
that
laces
thickly
there
isnt
any
distinct
sediment
and
the
head
retention
is
quite
fair
the
nose
is
distinctly
apricoty
with
an
underlying
tartness
and
subtle
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
as
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
fruit
play
nicely
with
the
souring
bacteria
on
my
palate
there
is
a
residual
acetic
dryness
but
it
doesnt
feel
as
if
microbial
cultures
are
growing
on
my
palate
the
beer
tastesfeels
a
tad
watered
down
its
refreshingly
fruity
drinkable
and
sour
as
expected
without
any
noticeable
alcohol
considering
this
beers
abv
is
nearly
2x
a
foufoune
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
its
reasonable
to
acquire
including
cost
and
availability
in
my
area
shipped
direct
from
the
brewery
i
will
purchase
it
again
at
next
years
release
o
the
fruit
presence
on
this
beer
is
awesome
really
impressed
a
fantastic
fruit
lambic
one
of
the
best
american
ones
ive
had
excellent
balance
of
tart
sour
with
sweet
fruit
though
it
definitely
leans
more
towards
the
sour
bottle
says
to
serve
at
40
degrees
f
and
i
agree
as
it
warmed
up
the
sour
became
more
prominent
overpowering
the
apricot
and
it
didnt
have
the
same
smooth
balance
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
pours
a
nice
golden
ale
with
a
white
rim
of
foam
i
dive
in
nose
first
straight
childhood
hit
me
i
grew
up
with
an
apricot
tree
in
the
backyard
this
was
beautiful
i
cant
understand
how
they
get
the
apricot
into
the
nose
like
this
fucking
magic
i
taste
anticipating
a
little
too
sweet
i
was
wrong
nice
and
tart
with
a
good
apricot
flavor
and
some
hints
of
lemon
and
the
slightest
taste
of
copper
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
i
left
with
four
bottles
so
i
musta
liked
it
so
did
my
bride
so
that
is
awesome
overall
really
satisfying
wild
ale
its
a
touch
too
hot
and
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
but
its
expertly
crafted
regardless
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
the
equally
easy
to
find
cascade
kriek
will
definitely
buy
more
bottles
of
apricot
o
great
beer
with
the
perfect
level
of
sourness
sweetness
and
barrel
characteristics
to
make
this
extremely
drinkable
i
thought
the
apricot
would
have
faded
by
now
early
2013
but
its
still
there
does
well
with
food
o
an
excellent
sour
from
cascade
sour
and
tart
yet
crisp
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
brings
the
sourness
and
funk
but
doesnt
completely
overwhelm
the
fresher
the
better
when
it
comes
to
the
apricots
definitely
worth
grabbing
a
bottle
even
at
17
a
pop
overall
cascade
cant
do
wrong
period
an
amazing
wild
with
all
the
trimmings
o
this
is
a
great
great
beer
my
first
apricot
based
sour
and
im
really
enjoying
this
bottle
many
fine
layers
of
flavor
are
showcased
in
this
brew
though
i
do
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
apricot
in
the
taste
i
assume
the
fruit
has
mellowed
down
a
cosiderable
amount
as
the
beer
has
two
years
on
it
id
love
t
try
this
fresh
nonetheless
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
crafted
by
the
crew
at
cascade
overall
starts
out
slightly
shocking
with
that
aggressive
sourness
but
man
this
stuff
is
addictive
really
liked
it
o
quite
drinkable
quite
tasty
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
i
usually
like
cascade
but
nevertheless
was
still
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
overall
one
of
the
great
american
sours
currently
being
produced
o
first
lambicwild
ale
ive
had
of
the
apricot
variety
and
really
enjoyed
it
loving
the
lactic
spin
on
the
tripel
seek
this
one
out
as
the
price
was
moderate
and
a
quality
apricot
sour
is
quite
hard
to
come
by
this
was
neat
and
really
sour
but
not
worth
the
hype
and
not
full
of
apricot
tims
bottle
2008
vintage
that
has
mellowed
out
as
we
shall
see
orange
coloured
body
understated
carbonation
very
malty
subdued
acidity
very
good
drinkability
im
glad
to
have
had
it
but
not
overwhelmed
perhaps
the
bold
taste
of
a
fresh
vintage
makes
a
difference
overall
a
really
nice
and
inventive
sour
ale
the
barrel
notes
are
really
strongly
integrated
and
work
well
with
the
heavy
fruit
the
apricot
is
definitely
the
star
here
and
showcases
great
sweet
and
tart
notes
i
was
really
surprised
the
fruit
was
so
present
this
long
after
bottling
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
although
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
heavy
at
20
a

2009
bottling
90
alcvol
750ml
brown
bottle
shared
with
friends
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
i
really
like
this
peachy
nose
apricot
candy
some
acidity
on
the
nose
the
fuzzy
peach
taste
is
very
interesting
easy
drinking
light
and
refreshing
this
is
a
classic
to
be
drink
i
was
just
talking
with
cpabeer
the
other
day
about
how
good
cascade
was
and
how
i
needed
to
try
more
this
was
one
of
those
bottles
i
need
another
one
or
to
go
seek
out
some
other
flavors
very
clean
and
crisp
well
layered
and
i
appreciate
the
amount
of
fruit
in
it
o
wow
my
first
dabble
with
cascade
and
definitely
not
my
last
this
is
amazing
i
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
but
definitely
going
to
age
it
as
long
as
i
can
to
see
how
it
develops
pours
a
copper
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
a
decent
lace
left
behind
the
nose
is
overly
sweet
and
simple
seeming
a
touch
artificial
candied
sugars
and
spearamint
tickle
the
nose
as
appricots
take
over
and
dominate
the
taste
is
sugary
and
minty
lots
of
appricot
roll
over
the
tongue
very
little
integration
as
the
mint
sugars
and
fruit
dont
seem
to
have
a
defined
roll
this
is
overly
sweet
with
a
creamy
syrupy
feel
prickly
carbonation
in
the
back
and
a
touch
wet
and
oily
overall
one
of
my
favorite
sours
fantastic
blend
here
with
great
oak
quality
and
fantastic
lacticacetic
treatment
this
bottle
is
the
2009
vintage
and
pours
a
somewhat
cloudied
amber
in
color
with
a
two
finger
and
very
effervescent
head
the
aromas
are
of
very
very
fresh
apricots
it
kind
of
smells
like
those
candy
peach
rings
it
is
very
fruity
and
somewhat
sweet
for
the
style
it
isnt
on
par
but
otherwise
it
does
smell
appealing
it
tastes
of
tart
dried
apricots
and
peaches
almost
like
a
poor
mans
geueze
there
is
a
slight
dryness
but
you
do
get
a
good
amount
of
sweet
and
candied
fruit
it
drinks
semi
dry
and
light
to
medium
in
body
overall
this
beer
is
just
ok
in
my
opinion
i
appreciate
that
they
made
a
beer
with
this
fruit
but
it
is
just
so
fresh
and
fruity
even
being
the
2009
vintage
i
would
like
a
more
tartness
or
a
legitimate
sourness
and
not
so
much
gummy
candies
if
this
beer
was
drier
and
had
some
funk
it
could
be
spectacular
right
now
its
just
ok
and
not
really
of
your
20
do
an
excellent
sour
ale
this
beer
is
not
as
palatefriendly
as
its
reputation
might
sometime
suggest
it
is
full
of
bold
flavors
as
suggested
by
its
9
abv
though
pure
alcohol
qualities
are
minimized
look
for
the
apricot
qualities
to
emerge
as
it
warms
but
classic
aspects
of
the
tripel
style
are
never
fully
realized
the
bottled
beers
of
cascade
are
always
a
tough
buy
due
to
their
high
price
tag
but
time
spent
in
the
barrel
is
worth
the
extra
cost
due
to
the
powerful
and
appealing
oak
qualities
that
are
derived
from
it
very
nice
flanders
style
sour
taste
is
apricots
its
earthy
mellow
very
tart
and
sour
but
still
drinkable
theres
an
earthy
quality
thats
unique
and
tasty
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
crisp
and
delicious
cascade
apricot
is
a
solid
sour
that
relies
mostly
on
a
sharp
lactic
sourness
and
fruit
flavors
i
like
it
and
it
was
quite
nice
to
drink
a
great
beer
solid
fruit
flavour
love
it
despite
it
not
necessarily
being
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
overall
great
stuff
more
strange
medicinal
notes
on
the
palate
it
tastes
like
fake
apricot
fruity
and
sour
as
expected
though
it
couldve
been
even
more
sour
a
little
funkymustygrassy
and
mildly
oaky
thin
crisp
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
not
as
interesting
as
i
had
hoped
unfortunately
real
good
attempt
for
brewing
this
of
a
base
tripel
a
little
less
good
as
a
fruit
lambic
but
i
consider
this
more
of
an
american
wild
ale
glowing
yellow
ornage
in
color
with
a
solid
lasting
head
and
a
trickle
or
two
of
lace
the
fun
starts
with
a
simple
smell
of
the
beer
apricots
sour
and
the
ecstasy
continues
into
the
taste
where
there
is
a
lot
of
awesome
flavor
to
fit
into
the
smorgasbord
apricots
all
around
but
its
not
over
the
top
sour
all
around
but
not
over
the
top
acidic
but
not
over
the
top
and
even
some
complimentary
lemon
flavor
and
then
i
learned
it
was
8
5
abv
which
is
amazing
considering
that
there
is
no
harshness
to
be
found
without
a
doubt
a
treat
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tasted
in
2011
o
an
excellent
beer
in
short
another
home
run
for
cascade
overall
a
stunning
beer
not
the
most
crazy
thing
they
make
but
consistent
and
very
very
high
quality
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
awesome
flavor
crisp
and
very
refreshing
during
these
summer
months
not
that
seattle
got
summer
this
year
still
waiting
for
it
the
apricot
is
noticeable
but
subtle
which
is
very
nice
i
dont
think
it
should
dominate
the
palate
4
5
this
ale
has
a
nice
apricot
taste
yet
you
get
a
true
sense
of
the
base
beer
with
the
malt
flavor
supporting
very
well
the
taste
has
a
semifloral
fruit
tinge
with
some
mellow
candy
and
jammy
flavors
iwth
light
sour
element
in
the
background
adding
to
the
tangy
mild
and
sweet
essence
there
is
a
slight
tart
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
i
loved
this
a
great
way
to
end
the
evening
with
a
flavor
that
is
both
full
and
subtle
where
it
counts
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
is
8
it
definitely
has
the
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
covered
d
very
drinkable
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
id
be
interested
in
trying
some
other
years
to
compare
overall
this
is
my
first
cascade
sour
and
i
couldnt
be
happier
with
it
also
my
first
apricot
sour
very
enjoyable
but
just
like
all
sours
i
will
only
really
cravewant
them
on
these
crazy
hot
summer
days
when
normal
heavy
beer
is
just
undrinkable
do
i
have
to
drink
this
again
no
but
would
i
definitely
blows
all
that
crap
lindemans
brews
way
out
of
the
water
very
well
done
alcohol
is
hidden
almost
entirely
a
quite
nice
beer
a
tame
gentle
sour
loaded
with
under
ripe
apricot
juiciness
cascade
does
not
disappoint
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
a
low
to
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
and
would
most
definitely
have
it
again
i
would
love
to
get
hold
of
a
bottle
or
two
the
aroma
was
beautiful
rich
sour
funkiness
with
huge
touches
of
apricot
mixed
in
light
peppery
and
spice
notes
come
through
as
it
warms
but
the
sour
funk
was
so
hardcore
the
flavor
was
puckeringly
good
rich
apricot
and
apple
vinegar
sour
notes
are
all
over
this
one
as
it
warms
like
barrel
notes
lots
of
spice
and
a
long
drawn
out
and
very
dry
super
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
this
was
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
had
taste
is
a
truly
refreshing
bretty
funky
apricot
ale
there
is
a
nice
complex
body
to
it
with
sweet
fruit
flavors
mixing
with
sour
ale
and
a
healthy
dosing
of
pale
malt
flavors
caramelized
sugars
also
chime
in
in
the
background
for
a
sour
lambic
this
is
a
really
nice
tasting
high
octane
sour
i
have
a
hard
time
letting
the
glass
sit
on
the
table
as
it
is
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
night
pours
a
orange
hazy
with
yellow
edges
a
lot
of
nice
white
head
looks
pretty
solid
smells
sour
and
tart
there
is
a
nice
citrusy
fruit
on
the
nose
smells
really
great
tastes
nice
and
tart
the
apricot
comes
through
very
strong
very
nice
fruit

nice
level
of
carbonation

very
solid

a
hit
of
funk
and
maybe
a
hint
of
red
wine
vinegar
as
it
warms
theres
fruit
leathers
too
like
apricot
of
course
and
also
something
like
koolaid
mix
palate
is
tart
right
off
the
bat
theres
enough
sweetness
there
to
keep
it
from
being
straight
up
sour
apricot
dominates
for
sure
with
tangerine
juice
and
orange
pulp
a
hint
of
wood
smoke
appears
and
then
vanishes
lemon
meringue
and
key
lime
pies
yum
tart
and
delicious
o
fantastic
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
full
acidic
sourness
and
apricot
fruitiness
this
is
a
brilliant
brew
thanks
todd
carbonation
keeps
it
from
too
much
heft
on
the
palate
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
the
slight
wood
finish
to
it
is
never
soggy
its
a
dry
one
did
i
mention
that
the
alcohol
tastes
nonexistant
pricey
at
20
a
bottle
but
thanks
to
jh1982
for
bringing
this
to
march
madness
2011
hell
of
a
time
we
drank
this
one
before
the
marquettesyracuse

me
worried
about
drinking
an
orange
beer
that
it
would
help
the

followed
by

juicy
and
mouth
watering
i
have
to
have
another
sip
perfect

the

a
pleasant

along
with
an
unfortunate

easy

and
hides
the

well
solid

though
not
great
o
although
not
as
sour
as
i
had
hoped
this
was
a
true
winner
in
my
book
super
tasty

i
need
a

of
this
2009
vintage

a
slightly
hazy

that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
very
strong
with

acidic
characteristics
as
well
as
lemon
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
initially
tart
with
some
acid

then
i
get
some
really
heavy

with
pleasant
apricot

with
some
more
sourness
and
a
lot
of
french
oak
mouthfeel
is
medium

and
very
dry

is
high
overall
this
beer
is
very
unique
with
its
belgiantripel
characteristics
not
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
very
well
balanced
and
delicious
this
beer
pours
a
deep
yellow
color
to
almost
orangish
with
a
nice
off
white
yellowish
head
the
smell
is
funky
with
some
decent
sour
notes
this
beers
taste
is
a
little
muted
compared
to
the
smell
i
was
expecting
some
more
sourness
and
funkiness
to
it
there
was
a
good
bit
of
sourness
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
will
seek
it
out
again
2009
batch
picked
up
at
the
barrel
house
wow
this
one
totally
took
my
palate
and
spun
it
out
super
complex
sooo
much
palate
pleasing
stuff
going
on
here
and
i
am
not
a
fan
of
apricot
9
aversion
east
coast
deep
amber
with
an
offwhiteapricotpink
head
that
pops
and
fizzes
but
settles
in
to
a
creamy
thing
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
good
lace
nose
is
fruity
and
surprisingly
other
fruits
seem
more
pronounced
than
apricot
i
get
raspberry
pear
strawberry
tropical

apricot
so
much
going
on
fruit
spice
wood
tart
earth
vanilla
honey
citrus
oldschool
bubblegum
and
layers
of
each
taste
is
sweetsour
and
fruity
up
front
turns
spicy
gets
woody
and
finishes
dry
with
a
touch
of
minerality
medium
body
that
seems
creamy
but
turns
silky
clean
with
a
warming
finish
that
amplifies
the
aftertaste
you
wish
it
had
a
stunning
beer
that
defies
style
and
boundary
would
love
to
taste
this
in
5
years
winner
its
a
little
too
sour
to
drink
much
of
it
would
probably
leave
you
feeling
like
the
time
you
were
ten
years
old
and
your
parents
let
you
eat
as
much
candy
as
you
wanted
in
smaller
quantities
though
this
stuff
is
awesome
thanks
a
ton
eric
this
was
my
favorite
brew
from
that
particular
session
id
definitely
pick
this
up
if
i
ever
run
into
it
d
very
enjoyable
the
subtle
flavor
of
the
apricot
is
very
well
integrated
here
something
id
look
for
again
even
with
the
pretty
substantial
price
tag
im
on
a
sour
kick
and
this
was
on
par
with
the
3f
oude
gueze
i
had
yesterday
yes
slightly
different
styles
but
overall
the
moral
is
the
same
i
could
drink
this
all
day
especially
a
day
like
today
where
spring
is
trying
desperately
to
make
headway
cost
and
availability
will
limit
this
to
an
occasional
treat
nicely
drinkable
and
strong
but
well
harmonized
flavors
need
more
of
this
beer
overall
a
good
beer
that
you
may
enjoy
more
than
i
did
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
d
the
drinkability
is
really
high
for
me
on
this
one
the
apricot
is
the
star
of
the
show
but
it
is
not
sweet
at
all
a
pleasant
sour
funk
helps
pull
the
whole
picture
together
well
done
i
went
into
this
expecting
an
american
wild
not
a
tripel
therefore
this
is
a
win
d
tastes
like
disappointment
got
this
bottle
in
a
trade
and
im
totally
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
something
has
to
be
off
with
this
bottle
ill
try
it
again
in
the
future
hopefully
with
better
results
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
the
beer
pours
a
golden
honey
orange
color
with
good
head
retention
and
decent
lacing
as
one
would
expect
i
pick
up
a
considerable
amount
of
apricot
on
the
nose
along
with
some
vanilla
and
light
cherry
i
really
didnt
pick
up
much
of
a
sour
component
in
the
aroma
profile
which
made
my
first
taste
all
that
much
more
of
a
surprise
while
not
over
the
top
the
sour
aspect
of
this
beer
really
dominates
the
flavor
profile
though
i
pick
up
considerable
apricot
as
well
there
is
also
some
light
vanilla
and
lemomlime
as
well
that
is
intriguing
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
long
sour
apricot
finish
the
sour
component
really
seems
to
counter
and
lighten
the
alcohol
impact
on
the
finish
and
once
again
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
the
abv
was
8
5
ultimately
drinkability
is
pretty
good
in
this
beer
though
the
sour
wore
on
me
a
bit
after
a
while
nevertheless
i
thought
this
another
solid
effort
from
the
folks
at
cascade
a
really
nice
beer
cascade
seem
to
do
some
excellent
stuff
great
beer
in
line
with
the
others
ive
had
from
cascade
need
to
seek
out
more
definitely
drinkable
sour
but
not
too
sour
another
great
aged
ale
from
cascade
d
really
liked
the
nose
on
this
one
and
the
flavor
and
drink
aint
half
bad
either
pretty
great
all
around
cant
wait
to
try
more
cascade
beers

if
you
like
sours
and
apricot
then
you
should
like
this
beer
its
yummy
again
cascade
has
made
an
amazing
beer
i
love
how
the
beer
is
sour
yet
you
can
still
fully
taste
the
sweet
fruity
flavor
of
apricot
worth
buying
if
you
see
it
the
body
was
slightly
over
carbonated
but
just
barely
otherwise
this
beer
drank
like
a
dream
tasty
intense
and
highly
enjoyable
this
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
sours
ive
ever
had
authors
note
we
have
a
huuuuge
fruit
sour
tasting
coming
soon
so
that
statement
may
not
hold
up
after
march
i
love
this
beer
and
would
buy
this
again
and
again
nice
sour
straight
great
stuff
overal
impression
another
winner
from
the
reigning
king
of
american
sours
d
more
please
at
9
definitely
more
please
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
enjoyable
the
drinkability
is
relatively
high
for
this
style
the
sourness
is
in
the
forefront
but
well
balanced
with
a
sweet
finish
and
other
flavors
to
make
this
a
really
nice
beverage
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
shared
a
750
with
a
friend
would
like
another
medium
bodied
a
bit
syrupy
but
light
and
airy
at
the
same
time
with
the
high
carbonation
reviewed
on

2009
bottle
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
apricots
peach
sweet
tart
candies
light
funk
lactic
acid
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
tart
like
the
candies
with
some
sour
apricot
the
sour
apricot
really
comes
out
in
the
finish
overall
very
drinkable
and
tasty
quite
tart
perhaps
not
as
fruity
as
i
would
have
hoped
but
one
of
the
better
fruity
sour
ales
out
there
d
pretty
good
overall
bottle
poured
a
clear
bright
dark
yellow
color
ale
with
a
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
excellent
lacing
aroma
of
sour
notes
with
light
acidic
notes
with
some
light
tart
apricot
notes
taste
is
also
a
very
nice
mix
between
some
light
acidic
notes
with
some
tart
and
sour
notes
with
lightly
sweet
notes
of
apricot
no
notes
of
oak
and
apricot
notes
are
very
subtle
very
nice
beer
and
drinkability
is
quite
high
with
alcohol
being
well
hidden
2009
from
the
bottle
this
one
could
serve
as
a
flanders
for
aficionados
or
noobs
bright
orange
color
aroma
is
more
funk
than
fruit
however
neither
is
too
strong
by
style
expect
more
sour
and
fruitforward
but
still
a
good
beer
nonetheless
apricot
is
in
the
background
here
easydrinking
bottle
i
believe
this
is
a
2009
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
honey
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
nicely
laces
as
it
settles
if
memory
serves
me
correctly
i
dont
believe
cascade
uses
brett
but
this
has
an
aroma
of
brett
to
it
with
florals
and
a
touch
of
fruit
i
expected
this
to
have
a
more
fruit
forward
aroma
vs
the
florals
light
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
flavor
is
brettlike
floral
with
touches
of
sweetness
the
apricot
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
strong
as
i
would
have
liked
and
the
flavor
seems
almost
watered
down
not
bad
but
i
thought
this
would
have
been
better
d
i
dont
like
this
one
as
much
as
the
kriek
but
it
is
still
one
of
the
better
wildsour
brews
available
d
an
enjoyable
and
sophisticated
sipper
both
challenging
and
intriguing
to
the
senses
i
seem
to
always
want
another
sip
before
my
glass
even
leaves
my
hand
pours
a
nice
pale
apricot
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
really
quite
tart
with
lactic
sourness
and
a
good
dose
of
apricot
and
peach
flavors
some
light
green
apple
as
well
the
taste
brings
in
a
bit
of
oak
and
a
really
nice
sour
to
fruit
ratio
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
out
of
this
world
as
the
fruit
and
sourness
levels
combine
quite
well
this
is
just
short
of
the
level
where
the
sourness
begins
to
affect
drinkability
my
favorite
of
their
sours
to
date
im
very
very
glad
they
ship
this
out
to
philly
overall
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
but
i
couldnt
help
but
compare
it
to
foufoune
this
beer
just
couldnt
compete
with
cantillons
apricot
sour
it
was
still
drinkable
however
drinks
like
every
other
cascade
ive
had
theyre
good
sours
to
be
sure
but
never
mindblowing
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
appropriate
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
by
the
musty
and
sour
flavors
this
is
one
i
will
look
for
again
in
the
future
glad
this
brewery
is
in
new
england
a
gritty
lambic
that
has
the
air
of
belgian
beers
made
by
american
then
aged
to
level
out
any
inconsistencies
this
brewer
has
experience
this
a
clean
beer
but
not
a
lambic
too
boozy
i
can
feel
the
triple
in
my
teeth
and
throat
the
apricot
is
wonderful
though
sits
and
milds
the
acidic
quality
with
some
mealiness
has
a
malt
finish
that
really
makes
the
beer
and
provides
a
nice
balance
with
the
sour
making
the
sour
not
appear
like
a
mask
for
a
soured
tripel
i
think
the
vent
danges
is
a
far
superior
beer
very
nice
beer
from
cascade
recommended
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
tasty
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
after
a
while
the
apricot
starts
to
take
over
the
palette
and
it
gets
a
bit
too
fruity
and
one
dimensional
for
my
taste
a
375ml
would
be
perfect
for
this
one
drinkability
for
an
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
style
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
i
have
a
feeling
mine
was
a
bit
infected
as
upon
opening
it
kept
foaming
over
almost
incessantly
the
glass
my
girlfriend
poured
had
no
head
while
mine
was
thick
still
being
a
sour
style
this
can
stand
up
to
that
pretty
well
and
still
remains
a
very
good
brew
i
could
easily
have
two
bombers
of
these
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
a
8
5
and
its
not
too
sour
very
easy
to
drink
would
pair
very
well
with
stone
fruit
deserts
d
highly
palatable
and
highly
drinkable
the
apricot
ale
is
almost
too
easy
to
drink
d
excellent
brew
from
cascade
overall
i
was
a
pretty
big
fan
of
this
beer
its
not
my
favorite
from
cascade
but
for
a
middleoftheroad
beer
from
a
brewery
theyre
doing
pretty
well
worth
a
shot
this
ale
appears
a
hazy
light
yelloworange
hue
there
is
a
small
head
that
leaves
a
tiny
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aromas
consist
of
funky
brettanomyces
oak
and
slightly
sweet
fruits
apricot
this
beer
has
plenty
of
flavor
the
wood
is
very
noticeable
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
the
beer
is
mostly
sour
but
does
have
a
subtle
sweet
note
in
there
as
well
this
is
a
really
good
beer
its
complex
and
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
id
like
to
have
it
again
pours
a
semitransparent
copper
color
with
good
white
fizzy
head
and
lacing
that
remain
strong
wild
yeast
citrus
apricot
smell
the
nose
on
this
brew
is
absolutely
fantastic
apricot
hints
in
the
smell
arent
too
apparent
but
come
through
strong
in
the
taste
very
sweet
and
sour
a
bit
tart
fruity
and
flavorful
absolutely
fantastic
light
to
medium
body
long
flavor
duration
and
sweet
tart
finish
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
candy
smarties
i
highly
recomend
trying
this
brew
pours
a
hazed
golden
oranage
color
with
full
cap
of
prickly
white
head
diminishes
quickly
but
leaves
great
lacing
scent
is
of
lactic
sourness
apricots
tangerine
grahmn
cracker
taste
brings
a
nice
sourness
that
is
in
great
balance
with
the
apricots
nice
amounts
of
grahmn
cracker
with
soft
presence
of
vanilla
and
oak
medium
bodied
perfect
level
of
carbonation
soft
on
the
palate
an
excellent
sour
from
cascade
that
lets
the
fruit
shine
through
with
a
perfectly
balanced
level
of
sourness
d
i
would
have
no
issues
drinking
this
all
day
d
and
overall
impression
the
only
thing
limiting
the
drinkability
is
the
tartness
which
dosent
bring
the
score
down
much
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
and
one
that
i
will
be
picking
up
often
skal
another
great
sour
from
cascade
theyre
really
putting
out
some
stellar
stuff
i
look
forward
to
trying
several
others
while
in
portland
this
week
little
bit
of
a
gush
on
this
one
even
after
a
chill
pours
nice
after
that
with
an
orange
yellow
hugh
and
slight
cloudy
apperance
crisp
white
head
lovely
lacing
aroma
is
blame
appricots
followed
by
clear
lactic
sourness
flavor
is
of
a
nice
golden
ale
base
apricots
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
with
a
lactic
sour
finish
only
two
things
about
the
taste
is
a
slight
bit
of
diactyle
and
some
astringency
that
i
get
on
the
finish
crisp
and
sharp
mouthfeel
with
a
little
more
carb
then
i
expected
drinkable
but
that
diacytle
and
astringency
is
getting
me
drinkability
quite
so
for
a
lambicsour
this
is
quite
enjoyable
and
at
such
a
high
abv
i
cant
taste
even
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
i
am
glad
i
opened
this
up
tonight
to
enjoy
on
such
a
great
cool
summer
night
in
southern
california
better
than
i
expected
and
i
will
pick
this
up
if
i
run
into
it
in
the
future
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
sour
i
picked
up
from
cascade
drinkability
solid
fruit
beer
and
good
beer
for
someone
lookign
to
get
into
sours
i
know
i
love
a
beer
when
i
am
already
trying
to
figure
out
when
to
enjoy
the
next
bottle
i
just
saw
this
at
a
store
and
i
will
have
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
before
this
vintage
vanishes
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
years
version
great
beer
d
having
had
the
kriek
as
a
comparison
cascades
line
of
lambics
are
a
simple
yet
very
well
executed
take
on
the
style
not
too
tart
not
too
fruity
with
an
overall
wellbalanced
favor
that
wont
offend
many
but
wont
impress
the
heck
out
of
anyone
either
still
id
never
hesitate
to
reach
for
one
of
these
good
beer
this
was
amazing
blew
away
my
expectations
flavors
kept
interest
d
very
very
drinkable
not
too
sweet
especially
considering
the
style
not
too
sour
quite
an
interesting
balance
j
beer
tastes
great
very
tart
nice
acidity
and
good
fruit
flavors
with
a
mild
sweetness
very
tasty
overall
the
sourness
is
a
little
subtle
but
a
great
beer
all
around
loved
it
pours
a
light
shimmering
copper
color
with
a
lighttan
head
aroma
is
vivid
sweet
dried
apricots
pretty
cut
and
dry
there
flavor
is
also
apricotdominated
with
a
bit
of
unripeness
and
a
somewhat
solvent
acidity
sweet
at
first
but
after
the
palate
calibrates
the
sharp
tartness
attacks
the
corners
of
the
palate
not
terribly
sour
pretty
good
the
fruit
is
really
bright
and
freshtasting
pours
a
nice
amber
color
surprisingly
clear
with
a
huge
sticky
head
the
bubbles
are
massive
and
loose
and
leave
cobwebbed
lacing
a
the
start
then
the
head
fades
just
a
bit
to
a
ring
and
leaves
tighter
clumps
of
bubbles
looks
good
darker
than
i
expected
i
guess
the
smell
is
slightly
tart
pretty
fruity
like
peaches
and
some
tart
berries
it
smells
pretty
sweet
also
you
can
sense
the
funkiness
of
this
one
there
too
id
say
its
not
the
best
smelling
lambic
but
all
of
the
elements
are
there
the
flavor
comes
out
with
fruit
like
fleshy
soft
juicy
fruit
the
beer
is
fairly
sweetn
not
too
tart
at
all
and
the
apricots
kind
of
win
in
the
fruitiness
but
i
can
also
detect
berries
i
can
kind
of
taste
the
malt
but
mixed
with
the
yeast
character
it
just
comes
across
as
straw
and
grass
i
also
get
a
little
peach
alcohol
taste
after
the
fruit
and
as
it
warms
you
start
to
get
the
wildness
of
this
one
and
i
dont
think
it
is
the
most
successfully
developed
wild
ale
theres
just
this
b
o
and
foot
funkiness
that
didnt
seem
to
get
to
the
point
of
the
acidic
bacteria
coming
in
so
theres
very
little
acid
or
dryness
to
balance
out
this
thick
sweetness
in
this
one
these
are
definitely
characteristics
of
wild
ales
kind
of
normal
ones
but
its
too
one
dimensional
and
a
little
like
fruity
sweat
if
that
at
all
makes
sense
the
body
is
nice
and
full
with
a
moderate
carbonation
but
its
not
as
dry
and
maybe
a
little
too
full
for
a
good
lambic
and
i
got
a
little
bored
of
it
while
i
was
drinking
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
tartness
and
acidity
maybe
a
little
longer
conditioning
to
really
let
those
flavors
develop
more
or
maybe
it
went
too
long
and
the
bacteria
started
eating
the
wrong
stuff
sometimes
i
cant
tell
the
difference
or
maybe
i
dont
know
it
well
enough
the
fruit
would
be
nice
in
a
more
sour
tasting
beer
it
has
a
very
nice
effect
analysis
aside
my
overall
opinion
is
mmm
2009
750ml
bottle
thanks
to
sincerenc
cloudy
orange
almost
brown
smells
quite
interesting
sour
yet
not
so
fruity
not
much
funk
either
the
flavor
was
odd
slightly
sour
slightly
sweet
almost
like
a
sweet
and
sour
apricot
candy
but
the
apricot
flavors
were
very
very
subtle
to
me
at
one
point
i
thought
it
was
a
sweet
pixie
stick
id
be
interested
to
try
their
other
bers
but
at
22
this
would
never
get
a
repeat
purchase
from
me
at
15
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
with
some
regularity
craft
beer
prices
have
gotten
a
little
too
out
of
control
these
days
when
they
are
charging
more
than
cantillon
or
drie
fonteinen
for
sours
a
great
offering
from
cascade
probably
my
favorite
beer
ive
tried
from
them
slightly
funky
dry
tart
medium
body
thats
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
slightly
vinegary
and
mouth
puckering
without
being
acidic
at
all
the
lacto
presence
from
the
aroma
is
very
prominent
and
give
the
mouthfeel
a
smooth
creamy
character
lots
of
earthy
oak
tannis
from
the
barrel
aging
that
gives
off
some
vanilla
flavor
dry
bretty
effervescence
balanced
b
a
very
prominent
juicy
apricot
flavor
extremely
quaffable
and
the
high
abv
id
undetectable
again
as
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
nice
authentic
funkiness
that
adds
to
the
flavor
and
complexity
of
an
already
excellent
beer
recommended
2009
vintage
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
apricot
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
apricots
with
some
light
tartness
the
beer
is
semidry
and
retains
a
little
of
the
sweetness
from
the
fruit
very
drinkable
high
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
d
surprised
this
is
over
8
abv
for
that
reason
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
the
syrupy
sweetness
keeps
it
from
getting
super
drinkable
a
very
light
feel
easy
to
drink
but
kinda
blah
that
wouldnt
make
me
want
to
drink
much
d
the
bottle
said
9
this
feels
nowhere
near
it
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
abv
a
damn
good
fruit
beer
d
i
always
enjoy
cascade
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
glad
that
ive
been
able
to
try
this
brew
a
couple
times
flavor
is
awesome
apricot
sweetness
there
but
mild
a
great
tart
and
funk
controls
the
majority
of
the
taste
high
carbonation
but
perfect
and
complimenting
oak
and
small
notes
of
vinegar
and
dry
finish
light
and
extremely
crisp
mouthfeelbody
this
is
a
great
drinker
final
thought
an
awesome
beer
from
cascade
i
like
it
but
its
so
incredibly
bright
and
sweet
that
its
like
drinking
liquid
candy
and
at
750
ml
all
to
myself
tonight
i
cant
rate
drinkability
that
high
doubt
ill
even
get
through
the
bottle
but
i
love
it
big
and
extreme
and
alcoholic
so
i
do
enjoy
it
and
can
confidently
say
this
lambic
will
never
be
mistaken
as
a
girly

wowza
this
ones
tasting
super
fresh
and
very
tart
incredibly
quenching
and
sharp
with
loads
of
apricot
maybe
a
bit
more
funk
and
sourness
would
be
nice
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
this
beer
pours
a
clear
honey
colored
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
nice
head
retention
certainly
more
than
i
had
anticipated
in
a
lambic
nose
is
drenched
in
apricot
with
a
bit
of
a
boozy
smell
and
the
sourness
definitely
comes
through
taste
is
apricot
mixed
with
a
sourness
that
balances
well
nose
would
lead
you
to
believe
that
the
taste
would
be
much
more
sweet
there
is
a
pretty
sweet
finish
to
this
but
doesnt
leve
much
of
an
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
reminiscent
of
wine
but
the
carbonation
in
here
definitely
gives
you
the
beer
feel
very
dry
finish
and
i
liked
it
for
this
beer
this
is
an
outstanding
fruit
beer
not
my
style
to
sit
with
for
an
evening
but
definitely
one
that
could
be
enjoyed
with
friends
thanks
for
sharing
this
one
arne
750ml
bottle
into
a
couple
of
pint
glasses
strawcolored
with
good
clarity
for
the
first
pour
at
least
with
a
small
1
finger
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
big
fruity
aroma
with
a
touch
of
musty
barrel
beneath
there
isnt
much
tripel
character
left
in
the
aroma
beyond
the
faintest
hint
of
pale
malt
nicely
balanced
on
the
palate
not
bracingly
sour
by
any
means
light
lemony
tartness
just
a
hint
of
funk
dry
and
grainy
big
apricot
flavor
minus
the
sweetness
little
bit
of
cardboardlike
oxidation
in
the
finish
great
stuff
it
lands
somewhere
between
a
standard
fruit
beer
and
a
wild
ale
hugely
interesting
and
the
backbone
beer
actually
shows
through
with
the
triple
maltiness
and
helps
everything
tie
together
quite
well
soured
belgian
tripel
aged
with
fresh
apricots
golden
crystalline
a
joy
to
the
eye
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
pure
fruit
and
the
way
the
wild
yeast
grips
the
flavors
of
the
tripel
this
is
really
puckering
less
lactic
more
foufouney
the
beer
was
rather
high
gravity
to
start
and
that
adds
a
real
pleasant
sipping
aspect
to
the
experience
most
big
sours
ive
had
carry
some
excess
sweetness
not
this
one
balanced
for
a
fruit
beer
consumer
must
love
apricots
d
rivals
and
dominates
any
fruit
beer
i
have
ever
enjoyed
this
beer
demands
respect
and
it
is
well
deserved
opening
a
bottle
of
this
on
a
summers
evening
is
nirvana
drinkability
the
flavor
profile
is
compelling
with
bit
more
carbonation
this
would
be
extraordinary
cascade
apricot
is
a
simple
and
momentarily
elegant
ale
though
it
is
somehow
incomplete
without
a
more
fully
expressed
measure
of
fruit
flavor
give
it
some
warming
and
a
wishful
hint
of
apricot
does
emerge
a
highly
drinkable
beer
bought
a
bottle
after
drinking
this
at
the
lodge
and
i
am
looking
very
forward
to
drinking
this
later
hopefully
it
will
last
a
while
in
the
cellarfridge
drinkability
is
pretty
high
for
me
this
is
a
suitable
champange
substitute
that
even
my
nonbeer
drinking
wife
has
indulged
me
with
a
glass
or
two
the
booze
is
a
bit
heavy
in
the
belly
though
with
a
bit
of
a
solevent
feel
cutting
through
the
sourness
which
coupled
with
the
high
price
limits
me
to
one
bottle
at
a
time
still
as
they
suggest
on
the
bottle
ive
had
a
lot
of
trouble
holding
onto
these
to
age
i
think
this
is
probably
my
fourth
bottle
great
to
share
with
my
wino
friends
to
show
them
how
diverse
the
beer
world
can
be
i
thought
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
3
theyve
recently
released
although
the
kriek
i
had
yesterday
slightly
edged
it
out
score
wise
mainly
due
to
the
lower
abvsugarbody
i
still
really
love
this
one
2011
vintage
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
honey
with
no
head
nose
expresses
citrus
and
some
oak
notes
taste
expresses
oak
citrus
and
tannins
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
an
almost
still
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
overall
a
top
notch
beer
i
think
i
prefer
it
better
fresh
however
this
beer
has
held
up
quite
well
bottle
pour
into
a
tulip
during
bottlecherwednesdays
at
beachwood
bbq
hazy
yelloworange
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
quickly
aroma
is
sour
tart
oaky
apple
cider
vinegar
unripe
orchard
fruit
especially
apple
and
grape
skin
flavor
starts
with
moderate
woody
tartness
followed
by
apple
cider
sweetness
theres
some
acid
on
the
finish
light
bodied
thin
in
texture
high
carbonation
dry
finish
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
this
is
a
nuanced
sophisticated
take
on
the
style
right
here
is
why
cascade
might
be
my
favorite
purveyor
of
wild
ales
in
the
states
because
they
understand
a
sour
is
supposed
to
taste
good
its
not
just
an
arms
race
to
jack
the
pucker
factor
into
the
ionosphere
after
having
new
glarus
wild
peach
a
few
nights
ago
i
might
have
had
two
of
the
better
american
wild
ales
this
is
an
elite
beer
no
doubt
about
it
fantastic
cascade
makes
a
number
of
amazing
sour
ales
but
vlad
the
imp
aler
just
might
be
their
best
although
this
beer
is
called
a
blonde
quad
by
the
brewers
and
classified
as
an
american
wild
ale
on
ba
it
had
many
of
the
characteristics
found
in
the
finest
flemish
oud
bruins
this
bottle
had
three
years
of
age
on
it
and
drank
like
a
dream
i
am
curious
to
see
how
it
is
fresh
out
of
the
gate
low
b
sweet
and
sour
salt
bourbon
too
busy
not
integrated
enough
a
cornucopia
of
flavours
but
suffers
next
to
something
seamless
like
cantillon
4
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
very
unique
sour
beer
that
i
liken
to
ghouschip
if
i
had
to
compare
it
to
anything
i
wish
i
saved
this
for
thanksgiving
to
eat
with
some
pie
amazing
oranges
lemon
peel
biscuit
oak
canned
pineapple
medium
acidity
taste
is
more
of
the
preserved
tropical
fruit
but
also
barrel
influence
with
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
alcohol
comes
through
in
bitter
finish
overall
great
aroma
but
a
tad
hot
on
the
palate
intense
and
complex
oak
vanilla
lemon
tropical
fruit
pineapple
and
such
very
heavy
body
pours
a
dark
golden
orange
color
mostly
clear
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
sour
with
faint
toffee
like
traces
and
plenty
of
barrel
the
taste
is
very
complex
oaky
tart
sour
trace
bourbon
tannins
ghost
fruit
finishes
bittersweet
and
slightly
dry
overall
a
world
class
sour
strong
sour
aroma
with
a
very
rich
and
complex
flavor
barrel
aging
is
exceptionally
well
done
with
enough
added
flavor
to
enhance
but
not
overpower
the
other
mostly
fruity
properties
moderately
tart
this
is
a
tangy
one
but
quite
good
and
quite
flavorful
pours
a
dark
orange
with
hints
of
amber
and
a
slight
coppery
redness
fluffy
white
head
sticky
legs
and
very
good
lacing

note
and
cardimum
taste
is
tart
orange

clove
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
great
medium
body
and
highly
carbonated
another
amazing
beer
from
cascade
overall
not
a
bad
beer
probably
my
least
favorite
from
cascade
thus
far
that
said
still
blows
most
competitors
out
of
the
water
2011
project
cork
was
probably
one
of
the
most
difficult
ones
to
remove
ever
pours
a
murky
golden
color
with
a
hint
of
amber
smallmedium
white
head
that
takes
a
little
time
to
go
down
goodlooking
brew
scent
is
very
inviting
green
apples
bourbon
citrus
fruit
barnyard
funk
pepper
grass
damn
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
smells
complex
taste
is
just
as
complex
initial
sip
is
lightly
tart
with
sour
apple
flavor
and
lemon
peel
sour
lemon
flavors
with
a
balance
of
sweet
bourbon
lovely
spiciness
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
other
than
being
delicious
a
bit
boozy
especially
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
a
little
cloying
but
with
a
dry
finish
seems
perfect
with
this
offering
drinkability
is
high
especially
for
such
large
abv
overall
like
the
other
cascade
brews
ive
had
this
one
is
very
complex
and
delicious
the
sweet
booziness
is
definitely
present
but
the
tart
fruit
light
acidity
and
mellow
funk
make
this
to
be
a
worldclass
beer
have
1
more
bottle
definitely
going
to
buy
more
o
a
very
complex
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
cascade
brewery
a
beer
worth
sharing
thank
you
from
chriscrundwell12
for
bringing
this
to
try
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
cascade
imo
complex
tasty
great
to
share
with
friends
onot
one
of
their
best
worthy
they
try
but
for
the
price
it
is
a
tough
buy
oda
really
interesting
wild
brew
i
love
the
barrel
influence
and
find
that
the
funkiness
plays
very
will
with
the
bourbon
notes
its
a
pricey
bottle
that
isnt
easy
to
come
by
but
one
time
is
well
worth
it
this
is
one
heck
of
a
beer
and
about
the
most
complex
one
ive
had
in
the
blonde
color
thanks
to
my
brother
for
bringing
this
one
to
the
table
its
a
sour
blonde
quad
blended
with
a
couple
of
other
sour
golden
beers
barrel
aged
hazy
pale
yellow
in
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
bubbles
the
nose
does
not
give
its
alcohol
strength
away
at
all
and
it
smells
of
sweet
musty
wood
souring
bacteria
spiced
rum
belgian
yeast
honey
and
wheat
malt
extremely
complex
layers
of
flavors
just
like
aromas
to
this
west
coast
gem
it
starts
quite
sweet
with
a
honey
and
spice
combination
and
its
immediately
followed
by
a
woodiness
before
sour
kicks
it
into
high
gear
the
combination
of
sour
and
sweet
in
the
finish
is
a
little
odd
not
dry
at
all
but
its
certainly
enjoyable
the
blonde
quad
is
an
interesting
base
beer
for
something
like
this
it
holds
up
well
to
the
other
ingredients
and
blends
but
also
serves
to
let
the
barrel
shine
through
in
a
unique
way
some
wine
vibes
on
the
finish
as
well
well
enough
carbonated
and
rather
light
in
body
for
what
it
is
an
extremely
impressive
beer
from
cascade
who
seems
to
be
doing
so
pretty
special
stuff
this
one
will
be
in
my
memory
for
awhile
t
a
nice
hit
of
sourness
right
away
then
a
rich
and
fruit
laced
heavy
sweetness
meaty
red
cherry
spicy
tripel
notes
white
grape
raisin
skins
and
some
candi
sugar
finish
brings
just
a
trace
of
bourbon
with
some
red
cherry
skin
tartness
and
a
pleasant
dryness
from
the
alcohol
not
my
favorite
from
cascade
but
its
pretty
delicious
really
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
overall
good
flavor
not
as
balanced
and
strong
as
kriek
a
very
nice
brew
not
sure
its
a
30
brew
but
it
still
is
quite
nice
very
well
done
and
blended
wonderfully
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
it
thanks
for
shipping
perry
very
tasty
sour
its
quite
strong
although
i
still
dont
think
it
tastes
like
10
abv
good
balance
of
fruit
barrel
and
overall
sourness
and
it
drinks
really
well
for
the
relative
strength
within
the
style
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
the
nonsoured
base
beer
of
this
referring
to
the
pale
quad
as
that
sounds
intriguing
another
great
brew
from
cascade
bravo
5s
should
be
rare
but
i
love
the
appearance
the
way
it
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
its
white
billowyness
it
doesnt
lace
but
leaves
thick
remaining
white
bubbles
the
taste
is
a
tad
thin
from
perfect
and
smooth
but
still
awesome
the
smell
is
rather
not
as
extraordinary
as
i
was
expecting
but
overall
this
is
class
sour
straight
up
at
almost
11
this
is
an
incredible
accomplishment
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
from
cascade
im
not
cheap
im
usually
completely
down
for
a
40
beer
if
it
is
truly
something
interesting
but
i
was
deeply
disappointed
by
this
one
o
this
is
a
great
lightly
tart
but
not
mouth
puckering
sour
brew
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
no
one
dominating
presence
im
thinking
its
some
sort
of
wine
barreled
golden
ale
or
even
saison
but
i
cant
seem
to
pinpoint
any
of
it
its
a
great
balance
of
tart
with
a
sweetness
well
incorporated
incredibly
tasty
stuff
gushed
a
bit
out
of
the
bottle
but
was
quickly
under
control
poured
into
a
night
shift
mini
feku
a
darker
amber
colored
liquid
more
hazy
as
it
got
closer
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
very
heady
capped
with
an
inch
or
more
of
offwhite
foam
nice
retention
and
lacing
aroma
was
sourtart
apple
cider
and
stone
fruits
hints
of
belgian
yeast
and
spice
funk
sourness
was
quite
tame
on
the
palate
taste
was
otherwise
quite
complex
apple
cherry
apricot
lemon
grassy
funk
peppery
yeast
light
acetic
acid
white
wine
wood
leather
and
i
almost
detected
a
touch
of
cinnamon
bark
in
there
medium
body
crisp
and
moderately
puckering
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
overall
o
a
nice
brew
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
i
like
this
a
lot
but
i
prefer
others
from
cascade
worth
a
try
if
you
have
no
problem
spending
the
bucks
overall
this
is
close
to
great
but
it
ends
up
being
just
good
i
feel
like
it
could
be
so
much
more
overall
an
interesting
complex
bold
sour
ale
that
swings
for
the
fences
and
might
have
come
up
just
a
bit
short
theres
no
denying
that
its
good
i
just
dont
know
that
it
was
quite
worth
the
high
price
of
admission
o
extremely
drinkable
i
drank
the
2009
and
2011
side
by
side
very
easily
i
would
have
guessed
t
was
around
67
great
stuff
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
cascade
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
i
will
definitely
be
iso
more
overall
a
great
beer
im
glad
ive
tried
it
is
it
worth
the
price
probably
not
but
for
aficionados
of
this
style
it
may
be
worth
your
while
to
give
this
a
shot
or
at
least
split
a
bottle
with
a
few
other
likeminded
folks
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
gold
with
specks
of
sediment
along
the
bottom
and
a
constant
blanketing
of
a
dense
offwhite
head
that
laces
its
definitely
presents
potent
notes
of
bourbon
apricot
unripened
peach
orange
zest
red
wine
and
a
touch
of
pure
smiles
it
tastes
like
id
expect
a
wild
blonde
highlighted
by
red
wine
bourbon
and
citrus
it
has
a
elegant
mouthfeel
presenting
as
sweet
tart
and
slightly
vinous
which
plays
nicely
off
those
big
barrel
aged
coconut
vanilla
and
slight
ethanol
it
really
doesnt
dry
as
much
in
the
finish
as
id
expected
this
beer
was
definitely
worth
trying
although
price
shipping
makes
this
a
hard
beer
to
consider
for
a
repeat
purchase
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
feel
a
little
letdown
it
is
still
a
good
beer
but
did
come
through
for
me
some
funk
would
of
helped
this
beer
a
lot
o
this
was
an
amazing
beer
o
sweet
belgian
with
lots
of
oak
and
bourbon
throughout
like
any
cascade
beer
vlad
is
layered
and
complex
with
a
bit
of
a
punch
there
is
just
so
much
going
on
here
between
the
base
belgian
ales
the
barrels
yeast
and
bugs
and
so
on
its
hard
to
say
it
isnt
good
but
its
hard
to
say
its
great
too
its
just
too
much
sweet
boozy
vinous
white
notes
very
trace
bourbon
vanilla
pineapple
interesting
would
not
buy
another
30
bottle
of
this
but
would
go
after
it
again
on
tap
m
its
a
big
medium
the
carbonation
makes
it
feel
a
little
lighter
than
full
not
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
but
definitely
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
ever
head
cascade
rocks
o
this
beer
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
the
malty
and
estery
base
beer
the
mild
acidity
and
the
tannic
bourbon
very
nice
now
that
they
are
charging
30
a
bottle
for
this
beer
plus
shipping
its
just
not
that
good
to
cough
up
that
kind
of
money
ill
take
two
bottles
of
their
apricot
instead
of
the
one
bottle
of
this
that
i
can
get
for
the
same
price
cool
beer
enjoyable
but
unless
you
are
just
rolling
in
cash
i
dont
see
stocking
up
on
these
to
try
once
sure
o
a
very
impressive
and
unusual
sour
ale
art
in
a
bottle
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
like
this
a
lot
but
remember
liking
it
even
more
o
a
really
interesting
beer
its
very
complex
and
balances
a
lot
of
very
different
flavors
very
well
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
but
may
have
enjoyed
it
more
at
8
abv
overall
a
nice
sour
with
some
great
belgian
qualities
enjoyed
it
and
looking
forward
to
the
vintage
bottle
at
home
some
day
soon
thanks
to
davehack
the
effin
man
for
opening
this
one
last
night
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
were
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
obviously
sour
but
also
has
this
subtle
sweetness
in
there
too
i
kept
picking
up
elements
of
either
the
bourbon
or
honey
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
tart
but
it
doesnt
melt
your
face
off
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
mixing
together
on
this
beer
really
interesting
stuff
the
mouthfeel
was
well
carbonated
and
light
bodied
overall
its
a
great
beer
and
thats
coming
from
someone
who
isnt
the
biggest
fan
of
sours
really
quite
enjoyable
d
this
is
ridiculously
interesting
and
in
a
good
way
the
taste
is
nicely
complex
and
shows
you
far
more
from
the
barrel
than
an
average
sour
would
trade
for
and
drink
again
no
doubt
love
cascade
love
vlad

pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
somewhat
funky
with
some
grain
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
acidic
quality
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
solid
flavor
but
i
like
the
way
it
smells
better
appearance
is
a
copper
color
with
a
short
white
had
vlad
has
a
nose
which
contains
wood
cloves
grape
and
a
tartness
is
certainly
present
i
tip
back
a
small
snifter
and
taste
cherry
bourbon
and
more
of
that
wood
this
a
a
sour
that
really
hits
me
an
alcohol
presence
but
i
still
really
enjoy
it
it
balances
out
a
bit
with
the
other
aspects
of
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
along
with
a
tartness
to
it
which
lingers
in
the
finish
overall
a
tasty
sour
beer
that
is
perfect
for
taking
your
time
with
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
dry
on
the
tongue
this
drank
incredibly
well
and
the
extra
time
aging
really
softened
the
10
abv
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
cascade
yet
a
good
sour
blonde
ale
fairly
simple
flavor
notes
overall
but
still
quite
enjoyable
this
one
has
been
sitting
around
much
to
long
tonight
it
must
be
drunk
the
cork
broke
and
i
had
to
resort
to
the
corkscrew
the
cork
was
really
dry
pours
a
deep
amber
bordering
on
copper
with
a
small
tightly
bubbled
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
smells
of
tart
and
lactic
as
soon
as
i
wrangle
the
stopper
out
of
the
bottle
tart
cherries
lemon
oak
vanilla
brown
sugar
lots
of
wonderful
aromas
waft
out
of
my
glass
taste
is
tart
with
a
hint
of
sugary
sweetness
up
front
i
get
a
hint
of
brown
sugary
type
sweetness
followed
by
a
heaping
helping
of
tartness
lemons
and
tart
cherries
with
a
hint
of
acid
followed
by
some
vanilla
and
oak
and
maybe
a
hint
of
ash
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
tart
kind
of
mouthfeel
wow
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
its
bigger
in
body
than
most
american
sours
but
its
base
is
also
a
quad
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
wish
i
had
more
the
pour
is
a
copper
transparent
color
with
tight
white
head
the
nose
is
lightly
vegital
and
medicinal
with
a
strong
fruit
and
barrel
component
the
flavor
is
the
same
with
a
light
bitterness
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
very
aggressive
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
pours
a
bright
orange
amber
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
sour
citrus
slight
brett
and
wood
tastes
sour
and
acetic
with
a
light
brett
component
sour
citrus
fruits
and
green
apple
some
darker
fruit
not
as
sour
as
some
other
wild
ales
not
my
style
i
was
able
to
finish
this
but
will
not
revisit
obviously
well
made
but
there
just
isnt
enough
interesting
here
to
overcome
the
sourwild
aspects
a
solid
sour
cascade
really
knows
what
their
doing
with
sour
barrel
aging
and
it
really
shows
i
have
yet
to
have
anything
bad
from
them
the
only
thing
i
couldve
hoped
for
was
more
of
a
bourbon
barrel
character
overall
impression
for
my
first
brew
from
cascade
this
one
rocked
my
socks
almost
could
be
a
gueuze
with
all
of
its
goaty
and
barnyard
attributes
would
highly
recommend
this
for
sour
lovers
and
aging
it
cheers
guys
overall
this
is
really
different
but
really
good
sweet
and
sour
great
balance
i
would
love
to
have
more
given
the
chance
overall
good
the
beer
itself
is
a
murky
hazy
gold
color
with
small
head
the
feel
needs
just
a
bit
more
in
terms
of
carbonation
to
really
kick
it
up
a
notch

pours
a
hazy
light
copper
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing

the

the
aroma
is
big
oak
oak
some
light
bourbon
vanilla
a
lactic

some
funk

and
a
bit
of
cinnamon
the
taste
is
oak
cinnamon
some
funk
light
boubon
some
vanilla
and
a
sharp
lactic
sourness
the
finish
has
some
light
alcohol
as
well
as
a
light
astringency
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
this
beer
was
quite
enjoyable
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
that
work
well
together
o
whiel
not
as
epic
as
i
hoped
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
that
requires
some
serious
time
to
dissect
in
the
end
i
just
dont
think
the
parts
equal
a
whole
that
wows
me
like
i
hoped
it
would
this
beer
smells
like
a
dirty
diaper
it
is
just
all
kinds
of
funky
it
didnt
taste
bad
but
it
just
weird
drinking
something
that
tasted
like
a
sour
leathery
funky
beer
that
also
smelled
like
digested
food
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
a
bit
too
chewy
and
over
bearing
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
really
complex
and
shows
how
amazing
a
single
beer
can
be
when
you
blend
3
separate
beers
together
to
form
1
synergistic
masterpiece
this
is
not
the
sourest
or
oakiest
or
anythingest
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
just
darn
freakin
good
cascaderaccoon
really
has
this
oak
aging
sour
brewing
and
blending
thing
down
pat
i
look
forward
to
sampling
their
other
blendedbarrelaged
sours
in
the
near
future
overall
im
impressed
by
cascade
they
think
outside
the
box
and
present
beers
that
others
are
afraid
of
attempting
or
even
thinking
up
i
love
the
creativity
and
uniqueness
without
being
cocky
and
pretentious
for
these
reasons
i
feel
the
overall
beer
is
quite
exceptional
pours
a
brilliant
golden
yellow
with
a
tiny
white
head
smells
amazingly
of
peaches
and
some
slight
oak
taste
is
mind
blowing
a
great
peach
taste
upfront
with
some
green
apple
and
wine
oaky
hints
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
great
sour
overall
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
had
the
chance
to
try
thanks
dyan
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
love
to
have
a
bigger
cellar
to
throw
a
number
of
these
into
o
a
very
solid
beer
the
abv
is
clearly
well
hidden
something
id
like
to
have
again
to
delve
deeper
o
an
exceptional
beer
and
kind
of
a
confusing
odd
blend
one
on
hand
its
tart
and
vinous
and
yet
in
the
same
sip
its
very
sweet
and
caramely
lots
going
on
here
super
complex
4
o
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
am
going
to
try
to
get
more
abv
is
a
little
big
for
being
a
sour
but
its
delicious
regardless
what
a
strange
brew
the
alcohol
is
too
much
here
and
the
beer
stands
divided
between
the
funk
and
tartness
of
wine
barrels
and
the
heat
and
smoothness
of
bourbon
barrels
a
nice
create
try
though
the
pour
was
decent
enough
with
a
clear
dark
grape
juice
looking
liquid
with
only
the
slightest
bit
of
carbonation
sticking
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sour
tart
notes
hints
of
a
woody
or
oak
like
touch
with
a
vanilla
touch
to
it
small
notes
of
cherry
or
some
light
fruit
notes
as
i
take
a
taste
the
feel
really
throuws
me
off
nice
tart
flavors
and
a
really
nice
well
blended
profile
much
different
then
anything
i
have
run
into
before
the
bite
of
tart
apples
is
lightly
offset
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
finish
nothing
too
bad
at
all
just
a
nice
one
to
put
down
the
tartness
was
not
strong
enough
and
the
subtle
hints
of
oak
too
light
to
make
a
difference
vlad
the
imp
aler
pours
a
sour
colored
grape
murky
very
murky
no
head
little
carbonation
and
bubbly
bring
it
to
life
with
a
glass
swirl
smell
is
sweet
tart
but
not
in
your
face
pretty
well
balanced
not
over
the
top
sour
in
the
right
places
mouth
is
smooth
this
is
a
really
solid
brew
across
the
board
very
solid
mouthfeel
with
even
and
perfect
carbonation
solid
start
to
finish
o
i
dont
think
i
liked
this
as
much
as
other
members
of
the
wild
ale
family
something
about
it
seemed
to
lack
for
me
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
one
i
didnt
think
id
have
the
chance
to
maybe
its
the
classic
barnyard
smells
and
flavors
that
are
missing
from
this
that
make
it
something
i
dont
love
o
i
may
enjoy
this
one
the
most
out
of
all
the
cascades
o
very
delicious
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
around
more
often
very
well
crafted
sour
that
isnt
pretentious
but
has
great
flavors
and
a
nice
rich
body
overall
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
its
another
solid
beer
from
cascade
well
worth
a
shot
another
beer
graciously
sent
by
my
east

thanks

enjoying
this
with
a
plate
of
dutch
gouda
and
crackers
pours
a
dull
orange
color
with
a
large
eggshell
white
head
that
fell
slowly
to
a
nice
cap
and
left
some
surprisingly
nice
lacing
considering
the
style
aroma
has
a
nice
citricacidic
punch
followed
by
some
musty
basement
bandaid
a
bit
of
hayherbs
and
as
touch
of
sweetness
taste
starts
off
slightly
acidic
tart
with
flavors
of
cherry
grain
lots
of
apple
cider
vinegar
some
of
that
bandaidmedicinallike
flavor
that
i
got
into
the
nose
light
leather
maybe
just
a
small
hint
of
apricotpeach
mild
sweetness
and
totally
dries
out
on
the
semisour
finish
not
a
lot
of
bourbon
from
the
barrels
but
it
might
be
there
in
light
amounts
i
have
had
this
one
other
time
and
thought
there
was
more
of
the
lemonleatherbasement
flavor
associated
with
brett
but
this
go
round
seems
to
be
more
on
the
balanced
side
with
lemon
only
making
a
fleeting
appearance
and
the
blonde
quad
characteristics
are
coming
out
much
more
which
probably
gives
it
that
underlying
cherry
and
apple
cider
flavor
body
is
nice
carbonation
is
good
not
too
spritzy
overall
a
nice
brew
i
could
definitely
go
for
more
citruslemon
characters
from
the
sournessbrett
but
its
good
overall
and
and
definitely
pairs
well
the
gouda
overall
loving
this
beer
very
pleasantly
suprised
i
love
the
acidity
and
fruitiness
mixed
with
the
oak
the
drinkability
for
me
on
this
is
very
great
o
very
good
beer
liked
it
enough
to
go
acquire
some
more
bottles
not
at
the
top
of
the
line
as
far
as
american
wilds
go
but
an
easy
drinker
thats
worth
trying
o
very
good
beer
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
plan
to
open
another
soon
i
got
this
in
a
trade
i
think
with
drez77
thanks
man
i
was
a
little
worried
after
the
bourbonic
plague
was
so
bad
but
this
turned
out
to
be
solid
orange
color
with
a
decent
head
but
then
it
disappears
nice
smell
of
light
citrus
sourness
and
a
hint
of
barrel
the
flavor
had
a
very
subtle
barrel
influence
and
was
sour
with
hints
of
bourbon
i
liked
this
but
i
should
have
split
it
with
someone
drink
for
me
the
hype
was
more
than
the
beer
still
solid
but
with
just
having
marron
on
tap
i
can
say
i
wasnt
blown
away
as
i
wanted
to
be
of
course
i
will
have
this
one
again
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
lightly
acidic
and
souring
quite
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
warming
quality
to
it
as
expected
for
10
abv
a
nice
salivation
factor
about
this
brew
makes
me
want
to
continue
drinking
it
with
ease
but
it
just
seemed
like
it
was
missing
something
perhaps
this
one
would
have
developed
more
in
the
bottle
as
is
its
amazing
how
wild
yeast
can
alter
the
blend
of
base
brews
nice
blend

d
pretty
good
though
trying
to
do
too
much
worked
against
this
beer
i
dont
think
bourbon
barrels
should
have
anything
to
do
with
sours
though
sour
abyss
wasnt
too
bad
anyway
decent
taste
that
gets
better
as
you
progress
through
the
bottle
d
not
a
bad
american
wild
but
not
cascades
best
either
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
vintage
again
in
a
couple
years
but
i
dont
think
i
want
to
trade
what
it
takes
to
land
one
of
these
o
i
thought
this
was
a
soild
sour
just
not
in
the
upper
eshelon
of
the
style
i
thought
the
bourbon
worked
better
with
the
darker
bourbonic
plague
but
soild
nonetheless

many
other
wilds
the
palate
opens
with
a
rather
pronounced
sourness
definitely
acetic
and
lactic
in
nature
and
surprisingly
huge
in
strength
its
immediately
followed
by
a
prominent
fruity
sweetness
with
honey
citrus
stone
fruit
particularly
ripe
yellow
clingstone
peaches
white
grapes
and
a
little
sugar
all
of
this
is
probably
from
the
base
tripel
i
cant
really
say
i
taste
much
of
the
quad
in
here
this
mostly
tastes
like
a
blend
of
blondes
and
tripels
in
some
way
the
sweetness
does
also
have
a
mild
splendalike
component
very
vinous
this
does
really
make
me
think
of
a
sweeter
white
wine
the
bourbon
character
isnt
particularly
noticeable
here
all
i
do
get
is
a
little
vanilla
tart
with
a
cleanlactic
sourness
and
moderate
tannins
on
the
finish
theres
also
some
sweetness
rather
sugary
that
lingers
still
this
is
ultimately
a
very
fruity
and
surprisingly
sour
beer
mediumlight
in
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonationthis
does
feel
quite
good
on
the
palate
apart
from
the
sweet
fruitiness
thats
present
alcohol
is
reasonably
wellhidden
though
it
does
make
its
presence
known
by
the
effect
it
is
having
on
my
sobriety
a
very
good
beer
though
i
have
to
say
the
asking
price
is
a
little
bit
too
high
d
good
drinkability
for
how
high
the
alcohol
is
in
this
wild
nice
got
a
stable
balance
throughout
thats
a
little
more
mild
than
wild
on
a
side
note
it
took
sweem
about
10
minutes
to
get
the
damn
cork
out
i
enjoyed
this
but
i
think
it
might
get
much
better
as
time
goes
on
in
the
bottle
i
have
another
bottle
that
im
going
to
sit
on
for
awhile
id
suggest
trying
this
one
out
if
you
enjoy
sours
another
good
from
cascade
d
a
very
good
beer
that
isnt
a
every
day
sipper
but
a
beer
for
special
times
a
very
smooth
beer
that
needs
to
be
appreciated
and
not
abused
once
you
get
a
bottle
savior
it
and
enjoy
a
nicely
balanced
sour
i
wouldnt
rank
it
far
above
the
other
sours
ive
had
but
there
are
some
very
nice
flavors
here
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
easy
carbonation
that
lets
the
beers
flavors
do
the
expression
without
aid
or
distractions
some
lingering
vinegar
sour
fruit
and
booze
end
the
ride
and
take
a
victory
lap
in
lieu
of
slamming
on
the
breaks
this
is
a
nice
wild
ale
and
could
be
more
drinkable
if
the
flavor
was
packed
into
a
less
boozy
bottle
still
something
i
would
try
again
d
i
like
this
it
is
certainly
unique
which
i
really
appreciate
for
the
style
a
richer
sweeter
representation
with
a
good
sour
background
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
really
adds
a
different
level
to
its
profile
worth
seeking
out
taste
is
really
tart
and
fresh
and
a
bit
sweet
mouthfeel
is
really
lift
and
crisp
this
hong
is
delicious
drinkability
is
good
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
at
10
6
abv
abv
on
bottle
but
quite
enjoyable
bourbonic
seems
pretty
good
now
but
vlad
could
maybe
use
a
little
age
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
bit
more
than
bourbonic
the
heavy
vanilla
notes
are
what
made
it
stand
out
for
me
more
sourness
would
be
nice
but
maybe
that
will
come
with
more
age
cool
stuff
d
considering
this
from
a
traditional
american
wild
ale
perspective
im
a
little
dissapointed
in
this
beer
however
i
think
you
kind
of
have
to
take
this
one
for
what
it
is
the
belgian
base
works
wonders
with
the
wine
and
bourbon
barrels
and
even
though
its
not
incredibly
tart
or
fruity
theres
very
good
complexity
here
not
your
typical
offering
but
definitely
worth
a
try
better
than
the
burbonic
but
nothing
special
overall
a
very
good
complexly
flavored
ale
that
is
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
is
a
freakin
sour
fruit
bowl
need
to
remember
to
find
a
bottle
for
girlfriend
d
an
overall
awesome
beer
i
definitely
want
some
more
of
this
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
was
much
better
than
bourbonic
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
a
singlefinger
head
that
dies
down
somewhat
quickly
but
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
behind
and
has
a
nice
collar
throughout
the
nose
brings
a
decent
amount
of
lactic
character
plus
some
citrus
and
a
fairlystrong
amount
of
green
apple
skin
the
flavor
is
sour
with
a
bit
of
funk
as
well
as
some
oak
and
a
light
amount
of
acetic
acid
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
with
a
good
sour
character
fair
amount
of
carbonation
plus
a
really
nice
level
of
drinkability
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
brew
though
in
the
end
i
simply
want
more
beer
is
light
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
on
the
palate
beer
is
very
tart
and
quite
sour
the
acetic
character
makes
the
palate
brighter
bringing
forward
more
tannic
and
oaky
characters
that
may
have
been
lost
in
the
beer
otherwise
the
lactic
is
also
very
forward
overall
this
was
a
great
great
sour
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
d
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
that
smelled
absolutely
amazing
it
had
a
nice
combination
of
sour
fruit
and
oak
which
i
thought
worked
really
well
together
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
one
d
easy
to
drink
not
overly
sour
d
this
was
one
of
my
personal
favorites
from
the
tasting
it
is
unique
and
genuinely
good
not
just
sideshow
interest
at
work
here
a
very
creative
effort
i
cant
wait
until
this
is
officially
released
golden
orange
appearance
with
just
a
bit
of
smooth
head
sour
lacto
but
doesnt
overpower
the
nose
some
belgian
fruitiness
coming
through
tastes
of
lacto
but
well
balances
with
fruits
and
floral
flavours
on
a
strong
malt
backbone
light
and
sharp
on
the
tongue
making
it
very
drinkable
easily
my
favourite
sour
overall
i
just
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
no
real
noteworthy
characteristics
quite
average
flavor
is
awesome
very
very
different
from
your
normal
sour
starts
with
a
very
quick
sweetness
but
taken
over
by
a
crispsharp
tartness
that
immediately
takes
over
then
the
bourbon
hits
and
finally
finishes
with
a
nice
wine
dryness
very
complex
and
delicious
medium
body
high
carbonation
kind
of
boozy
such
a
cool
and
different
beer
definitely
will
be
looking
to
gettrade
for
a
few
more
bottles
poured
a
golden
orange
with
pale
pineapple
yellow
highlights
with
a
thin
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
upfront
on
the
aroma
i
was
able
to
detect
some
funkiness
from
the
brett
with
a
little
corky
character
slight
vinegar
acidic
citrusy
notes
and
barrel
oak
notes
the
taste
was
sweet
and
sour
consisting
of
citrus
brett
oak
slight
vinegar
and
pineapple
accents
to
add
some
fruit
dimension
it
didi
seem
to
have
underlying
apple
and
pear
flavor
as
well
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
slight
sweet
but
fruity
oaky
bretty
funky
acidic
sour
and
slight
dry
finish
drank
amazing
and
was
almost
sucking
the
last
drops
from
the
bottle
soft
sparkling
and
sweettart
super
drinkable
d
i
had
a
couple
of
pours
and
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
know
they
are
different
beers
but
i
preferred
this
over
bourbonic
really
an
enjoyable
beer
ive
got
bottles
of
bourbonic
plague
and
the
vine
that
im
really
excited
about
after
drinking
this
offering
from
cascade
im
really
curious
to
see
what
some
cellaring
will
do
for
this
one
overall
ive
tried
a
few
beers
from
cascade
and
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
vlad
does
not
disappoint
flavorful
complex
but
not
overthetop
puckering
bottle
2010
version
bottle
opens
up
with
a
slight
pop
pours
a
pretty
heady
slightly
murky
orange
amber
color
the
head
is
a
tall
23
finger
fluffy
off
white
head
good
lace
as
the
head
subsides
the
aroma
to
me
first
and
foremost
is
tart
sour
cherries
some
minimal
funky
notes
as
well
light
mouthfeel
the
warming
alcohol
in
the
back
end
is
the
first
thing
that
i
notice
my
second
sip
yields
a
more
fruitful
tone
up
front
with
that
of
cherries
but
not
too
overly
sweet
the
carbonation
really
bites
at
the
tongue
ever
so
slightly
more
than
i
expected
lemon
acidic
like
as
well
in
the
back
end
mixed
with
the
boozy
its
definitely
an
odd
brew
the
likes
i
havent
had
before
theres
is
an
odd
bitternessfunkiness
right
in
the
middle
that
throws
me
off
a
little
some
floral
brett
notes
in
the
end
linger
on
different
but
not
overly
amazing
overall
i
think
it
is
good
but
i
am
not
overly
impressed
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
but
it
does
show
the
abv
i
think
this
one
is
a
bit
hyped
up
drink
ability
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
pleasant
a
small
head
of
off
yellow
foam
beer
pours
a
strong
orange
color
cloudy
in
color
the
smell
is
bourbon
and
oak
intermingling
with
tart
berries
and
citrus
the
taste
is
complex
with
spice
citrus
and
apple
cider
very
nice
sipping
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
warming
low
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
are
very
welcomed
here
the
abv
is
ridiculously
high
but
well
hidden
amazingly
easier
to
put
back
d
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
the
sourness
and
funk
would
keep
me
from
having
more
than
one
glass
in
a
sitting
still
sipping
one
of
these
over
an
hour
or
so
is
a
wonderful
experience
that
i
hope
to
have
again
soon
poured
a
nice
medium
amber
color
with
a
medium
bodied
ivory
head
the
bourbon
barrel
tripel
component
that
was
blended
into
this
one
was
what
intrigued
me
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
along
with
the
bourbonic
plague
which
i
loved
but
this
one
was
way
too
sour
for
my
palate
lots
of
funk
lactic
acid
lemonheads
sour
cherries
and
vinegar
for
me
at
least
this
one
was
nearly
undrinkable
d
the
best
and
most
complex
sour
ive
ever
had
russian
river
should
be
jealous
what
more
can
i
say
overall
a
great
sour
but
i
think
it
falls
short
compared
to
a
few
others
of
theirs
loving
the
bourbonic
noyeaux
and
sang
noir
much
better
tap
at
the
super
sweet
cascade
barrel
house
it
was
about
time
i
got
my
mitts
on
this
infamously
hyped
beer
poured
clear
amberorange
with
a
white
head
the
nose
was
candied
quite
sweet
with
a
light
yeast
funk
the
lacto
is
so
clean
compared
to
brett
which
definitely
is
displayed
in
a
lot
of
the
cascade
sours
some
acidity
going
on
maple
sweet
sugars
lactic
yeast
notes
quite
sour
and
tart
ginger
apples
light
fruit
like
a
tart
slightly
over
ripped
fruit
with
a
lot
of
added
sweetness
drinkability
is
damn
good
considering
the
abv
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
a
few
bottles
of
this
when
the
labels
finally
get

really

d
this
is
a
much
needed
redemption
after
my
taste
of

another
good

from
the
guys
up
at

some

picked
up
a

attentuated
mouthfeel
fairly
thin
a
far
different
flavor
profile
from
bourbonic
plaque
not
quite
as
complex
a
nose
and
taste
but
certainly
well
in
balance
and
ultra
tasty
really
drinkable
though
the
abv
is
a
bit
more
noticeable
than
the
plaque
this
is
one
subtle
and
yet
sophisticated
drinking
experience
d
this
is
shockingly
drinkable
for
the
abv
we
plowed
through
this
faster
than
any
of
the
barleywines
that
we
had
beforehand
a
fantastic
experiment
that
should
be
a
big
hit
when
its
bottled
in
larger
quantities
citrus
fruit
dominates
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
to
come
nince
tart
fruit
flavor
with
a
hint
of
the
wood
and
hops
way
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
but
never
wouldve
guessed
it
was
10

unbelievable
nice
work

a
woody
sourness
hits
the
tastebuds
with
a
zesty

from
the
lactic

light
phenols
balance
with
tart
lemon
taffy
and
oak
vlad
is
dry
but
not
overly
acidic
or
puckeringly
sour
a
plus
for
my
relatively
inexperienced
sour
palate
a
toptier
wild
ale
for
sure
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
yeasty
haze
no
head
forms
from
a
gentle
pour
just
a
thin
white
ring
circling
the
rim
of
the
glass
but
theres
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
is
bold
and
complex
ranging
from
musty
wood
and
damp
basement
to
cherries
and
plums
to
white
pepper
and
sweet
bourbon
acetic
and
lactic
acid
are
present
in
equal
quantities
stinging
the
nostrils
slightly
the
taste
is
equally
complex
opening
with
sour
cherries
plums
and
stonefruit
with
a
touch
of
caramellike
bourbon
flavor
buried
beneath
the
fruit
lactic
and
acetic
acid
are
at
a
moderate
level
sharp
and
biting
without
overwhelming
the
subtle
complexities
of
the
beer
carbonation
is
at
a
high
level
helping
to
offset
the
full
body
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
and
dry
leaving
flavors
of
pepper
and
orange
peel
lingering
on
the
tongue
this
is
good
stuff
but
it
becomes
a
bit
overwhelming
after
a
few
ounces
this
is
a
very
fruity
beer
in
a
fresh
peach
kind
of
way
it
has
a
nice
maltiness
with
lactic
sourness
livening
things
up
a
bit
the
alcohol
is
noticable
but
that
wont
slow
you
down
as
this
brew
is
quite
tasty
on
the
palate
this
beer
shows
a
nice
sweet
caramelly
backbone
quite
big
and
fruity
as
on
the
nose
with
a
decided
lean
toward
peach
flavor
finishes
clean
and
fruity
yet
with
an
earthy
dryness
beckoning
me
to
take
another
sip
medium
bodied
and
round
and
very
quaffable
hardly
shows
its
9
5
abv
just
sour
enough
tartness
up
front
with
a
slightly
puckering
mouthfeel
sweet
and
vinous
with
some
nice
estery
light
fruit
especially
apple
and
grape
the
oak
presence
is
subtle
but
there
is
a
good
bit
of
bourbon
heat
and
warmth
in
the
finish
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
d
very
high
for
a
beer
this
sour
and
strong
2nd
bottle
opened
by
jshufelt
at
our
cascade
tasting
on
12112009
thanks
jonathan
the
only
thing
id
like
to
add
to
my
previous
review
is
that
the
beer
is
a
good
deal
spicier
than
i
remembered
it
being
spices
are
strong
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
but
a
bit
more
so
in
aroma
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
for
10
3
beer
although
mainly
because
its
so
tasty
as
you
can
certainly
taste
the
heat
factor
in
the
reasonable
price
and
youve
got
another
home
run
from
cascade
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
amber
color
with
a
great
aroma
that
hints
at
the
joy
to
be
had
taste
is
of
dark
fruits
and
is
quite
sour
the
wood
aging
is
tasted
in
the
finish
though
does
not
overpower
the
other
flavors
a
must
try
if
you
like
sour
beers
i
also
think
the
classification
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
is
quite
misleading
d
very
nice
sipper
beer
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
enjoyable

idea
what
to
expect
when
i
ordered
in
all
honesty
the
name
sounded
cool
so
without
asking
any
info
i
just
went
for
it
i
am
still
new
when
it
comes
to
expanding
my
horizons
and
experimenting
with
new
types
of
beer
however
the
first
word
that
came
to
my
mind
when
i
tried
this
was
innovation
definitely
unique
and
i
am
very
glad
i
gave
it
try
highly
recommended
d
tasty
and
wellmade
ale
from
one
of
the
rising
stars
in
portlands
everexpanding
beer
scene
a
nice
one
to
sit
with
swirl
a
bit
sip
occasionally
not
an
everyday
beer
but
a
pleasure
to
have
on
this
day
and
one
id
happily
get
every
now
and
then
recommended
this
is
a
blend
of
cascades
blonde
and

is

taste

i
was
not
complaining
about
malts
come
into

and
the
beer
gets
sweeter
after
the

really
like
the

combination
funky

a

first
beer
i
tasted
from
this
brewery
but
just
had
the

arrive
in

a
few

now
i
cannot

to
open
those

light

this
one
really
surprised
me
and
it
was
very
nice
overall
tasty
ive
had
this
a
number
of
times
and
im
not
sure
why
i
never
rated
it
outstanding
id
serve
this
to
any
sour
fan
and
still
get
many
a
winedrinker
to
enjoy
it
o
enjoyable
but
not
surprising
a
solid
sour
entry
and
perhaps
even
a
good
starting
point
for
newbies
recommended
b
tastes
like
wine
flavored

very
nice
not
overly
sour
but
walks
the
line
between
dry
tartness
and
sweet

bubbly
carbonation
almost
gives
it
a
champagne
feel
it
is
very
good
not
my
favorite

but
another
winner
for
sure
oreally
enjoyed
this

good

notes
2012
project
hazy
golden
pour
medicinal
welchs
grape
tart
and
earthy
aroma
nice
oaky
flavor
and
lactic
acidity
on
the
front
end
the
grape
is
present
and
overly
sweet
up
front
with
a
strong
white
wine
like
alcohol
backbone
the
flavor
dies
out
with
a
mild
earthiness
carbonated
with
large
bubbles
which
didnt
help
the
mouthfeel
i
ended
up
drinking
a
glass
and
switching
to
the
white
wine
my
wife
had
opened
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
disappointing
given
the
price
and
my
expectations
i
wasnt
expecting
vigneronne
but
this
beer
really
needs
some
funk
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
add
some
complexity
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
didnt
pop
when
i
opened
it
either
smell
is
very
much
like
white
grapes
much
like
welches
white
grape
juice
taste
is
very
similar
as
well
it
has
only
a
tiny
bit
of
tartness
to
it
definitely
the
least
sour
tasting
cascade
ive
had
the
white
grape
flavor
is
very
prominent
and
pronounced
and
it
lasts
through
the
finish
and
lingers
its
definitely
what
it
promises
no
tartness
almost
at
all
is
quite
a
shock
not
sure
as
intended
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
quite
low
i
will
have
to
try
another
bottle
to
see
if
the
tartness
is
just
off
in
this
one
overall
though
the
flavor
is
on
point
maybe
better
fresh
overall
a
very
nice
sour
easy
to
drink
especially
at
9
o
for
some
people
this
might
be
a
good
beer
but
i
did
not
care
for
the
cottoncandyfake
grape
sweetness
at
all
alcohol
was
very
smooth
however
a
miss
for
me
i
would
not
be
very
happy
if
id
payed
for
a
bottle
rather
than
a
taster
cork
and
caged
bottle
from
tipples
2013
project
pours
clear
golden
colored
with
some
spritzy
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
aroma
of
slight
sour
vinegar
oak
grapes
citrus
peel
and
maybe
even
some
brett
flavor
is
lightly
tart
dry
with
some
oakiness
and
an
interesting
bit
of
grape
sort
of
like
grape
soda
rather
than
grape
juice
hmmm
some
vinous
notes
as
expected
medium
bodied
from
the
sweetness
but
rather
spritzy
with
the
carbonation
cascade
managed
to
make
a
31
beer
taste
like
dave
chappelles
grape
drink
not
drain
pouring
this
since
its
not
completely
offensive
and
cost
that
much
but
what
the
eff
seriously
what
a
ripoff
o
just
a
fantastic
beer
while
the
taste
didnt
completely
live
up
to
the
nose
this
was
a
fantastic
example
of
what
is
possible
when
the
lines
between
beer
and
wine
are
blurred
nice
work
cascade
o
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
its
a
little
pricey
and
for
the
cost
i
would
rather
a
different
beer
from
cascade
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
though
o
my
absolute
favorite
cascade
brew
its
restrained
tart
character
topped
off
with
a
nice
yeast
fruit
character
and
dry
almost
spicy
finish
similar
to
a
saison
makes
for
an
amazing
experience
a
must
try
and
definitely
a
worthwhile
reason
to
give
cascade
brewing
way
too
much
money
that
your
wiling
to
spend
most
of
the
time
in
this
case
wort
the
25ish
bucks
so
while
this
is
a
great
beer
i
think
it
can
get
a
bit
one
note
as
is
the
case
for
me
with
cascade
in
general
this
may
be
the
last
cascade
i
buy
the
price
point
on
their
beers
just
doesnt
seem
to
back
up
what
they
deliver
either
that
or
they
need
to
do
375s
at
half
the
price
cascade
learn
to
work
the
brettanomyces
please
not
wanting
to
be
over
critical
as
its
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
top
tier
or
close
for
that
matter
overall
its
a
neat
beer
but
its
lacking
a
bit
and
may
be
past
its
prime
its
fruit
composition
though
is
nice
but
it
also
reminds
me
a
bit
too
much
like
cider
which
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
still
decent
never
fear
however
as
this
would
still
pair
excellently
well
with
all
kinds
of
food
especially
a
variety
of
cheeses
that
immediately
spring
to
mind
goat
cheese
maybe
smoked
gouda
this
an
excellent
beginners
venture
into
grape
must
infused
beers
but
ive
certainly
had
more
that
were
far
more
complex
and
more
importantly
more
that
had
a
stronger
acidic
grip
that
complimented
the
grapes
and
showcased
the
power
of
the
yeast
and
barley
backbone
that
makes
the
beer
worth
a
try
but
dont
break
your
back
to
get
one
little
disappointed
by
this
one
2012
vintage
feel
like
it
needs
some
age
there
is
a
decent
grape
nose
but
the
taste
was
overwhelmingly
like
dimetapp
and
fruit
juice
might
have
been
a
bad
bottle
nice
pour
and
smell
though
as
expected
from
cascade
oone
of
the
better
grape
based
sours
ive
had
the
grape
flavor
was
large
and
in
charge
but
in
nice
balance
with
the
other
flavors
a
solid
sour
o
an
interesting
venture
toward
the
wine
world
which
i
might
have
liked
more
had
i
never
had
cantillon
vigneronne
theres
one
reaction
the
vine
evokes
sip
after
sip
a
loud
lil
jonlike
yeah
blending
and
souring
three
or
four
varieties
of
ale
and
then
further
barrelfermenting
with
the
juice
from
white
wine
grapes
is
what
id
call
a
pretty
highriskhighreward
experiment
cascade
hit
the
jackpot
not
as
intense
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
nor
as
sour
pale
cloudy
yellow
color
smallish
white
head
without
much
retention
smells
like
artificial
purple
grape
candy
when
i
really
sniff
hard
but
smells
just
like
a
sweeter
sour
when
i
dont
try
so
hard
wheat
malt
grape
must
and
lactic
acid
are
all
evident
i
taste
a
lot
of
oak
in
this
sweet
and
earthy
and
it
pairs
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
grapes
however
the
fruitiness
takes
a
lot
away
from
the
sour
properties
which
really
only
come
in
as
acidity
on
the
finish
not
a
lot
of
tartness
or
funk
or
pep
to
this
and
it
feels
a
little
dull
as
a
result
it
could
stand
more
carbonation
too
to
lighten
up
the
fruit
i
think
the
concept
is
good
and
the
flavors
are
good
if
a
little
muted
but
the
overall
product
is
in
need
of
a
refinement
it
is
a
full
step
or
two
below
the
elite
sours
on
the
market
but
still
a
quality
brew
this
bottle
had
a
little
age
on
it
so
maybe
it
hasnt
held
up
super
well
will
need
to
try
fresh
to
compare
lighter
side
of
medium
body
with
soft
but
ample
carbonation
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
after
a
few
sips
but
fairly
easy
to
sip
on
i
guess
i
should
not
be
surprised
by
the
flavor
considering
the
addition
of
grapes
into
the
barrel
probably
a
beer
that
would
improve
with
aging
nor
is
it
as
dark
as
the
glass
in
the
picture
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
im
actually
not
the
biggest
fan
of
artificial
grape
flavor
so
it
was
good
to
have
the
raw
authenticity
of
the
grapes
come
through
full
force
it
was
a
beautiful
thing
this
was
an
excellent
beer
and
definitely
something
id
like
to
snag
a
few
more
bottles
of
if
given
the
opportunity
i
think
over
time
itll
grow
even
more
sour
and
even
more
badass

up
another

a
semidry
puckering
finish
my
first
cascade
sour
and
it
was
nothing
short
of
incredible
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
this
brewer
even
in
spite
of
the
hefty
price
tag
it
is
lacking
carbonation
but
the
body
is
light
enough
that
it
is
manageable
it
would
be
nice
to
have
some
more
carbonation
overall
the
flavor
is
great
and
the
aftertaste
is
nice
the
feel
is
solid
enough
that
i
enjoyed
it
d
i
feel
like
this
is
the
perfect
example
of
the
cascade
wilds
that
ive
had
up
to
this
point
very
one
dimension
but
so
tasty
with
a
perfect
mouthfeel
and
incredible
drinkability
the
vine
almost
seems
like
a
better
sweeter
champagne
and
i
could
go
at
this
one
all
day
i
cant
wait
to
break
out
another
bottle
and
pick
up
some
more
definitely
worth
the
price
of
purchase
overall
i
was
a
very
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
love
the
flavors
of
american
grapes
concorde
muscadines
and
scuppernongs
and
i
find
that
its
difficult
to
accurately
get
that
flavor
in
a
beer
this
beer
succeeds
completely
and
has
additional
complexity
from
other
dark
fruits
and
the
malt
bill
well
worth
a
shot
very
tasty
sour
its
not
super
funky
though
thats
probably
because
its
so
fresh
you
could
definitely
taste
the
earthiness
of
the
grapes
it
pours
a
golden
light
brown
color
that
is
beautiful
with
a
somewhat
off
white
creamy
head
its
not
super
complicated
but
in
terms
of
being
a
very
solid
sour
that
has
the
potential
to
really
grow
into
itself
i
certainly
think
that
it
can
get
there
would
love
to
try
one
with
some
age
on
it
drinks
uncontrolled
the
vine
has
pleasing
flavors
but
the
sourness
gets
just
a
bit
out
of
hand
the
beer
pours
a
honey
amber
color
with
good
head
retention
and
considerable
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
wild
showcasing
vinegar
and
sour
funk
along
with
a
very
noticeable
grape
and
berry
aroma
fortunately
the
dead
moose
and
headcheese
aroma
arent
too
overpowering
in
this
beer
though
its
definitely
there
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
pretty
impressive
with
the
sour
funk
acting
as
a
backdrop
for
the
grape
and
berry
flavors
theres
also
some
noticeable
banana
vanilla
and
even
a
hint
of
bubblegum
all
wrapped
around
a
core
of
sour
funk
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
the
beer
ending
with
a
long
mouthpuckeringly
sour
zip
on
the
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
i
found
the
sour
funk
to
be
a
bit
of
a
distraction
after
a
while
nevertheless
i
thought
this
another
solid
beer
from
cascade
with
enough
other
stuff
going
on
flavor
and
aromawise
to
keep
the
sour
component
from
becoming
overwhelming
impressive
d
not
the
best
of
cascades
beers
but
quite
good
nonetheless
i
still
had
no
problem
enjoying
my
sample
d
a
sipper
the
high
acidity
gives
me
no
choice
i
liked
the
beer
in
the
end
though
i
think
i
wanted
a
little
sugarfruit
to
counterbalance
the
acid
i
know
theres
grapes
but
theyre
hard
to
find
a
solid
beer
interesting
to
try
but
at
20
there
are
plenty
of
other
awas
and
cascades
id
rather
get
almost
layered
looking
pour
darker
on
top
honey
gold
on
the
bottom
quickly
dissipating
head
leaves
no
lacing
etching
from
the
duvel
tulip
keeps
the
bubbles
coming
though
despite
the
seeming
stillness
this
is
a
highly
carbonated
beer
prickly
and
high
on
the
tongue
this
mellows
as
the
beer
sits
first
wafts
had
me
fearful
of
an
artificial
grape
sweetness
laffy
taffy
and
sweet
tarts
thankfully
that
fades
nice
lactic
tartness
grape
skins
very
faint
funk
some
hints
of
apple
juice
a
very
mellow
tart
sipper
nothing
in
your
face
much
better
as
the
drink
warms
allowing
more
character
of
the
oak
and
at
long
last
the
alcohol
to
shine
through
for
a
nearly
9
beer
you
would
never
know
it
class
act
all
around
pours

cloudy

full
of

some
dry

not
overly
sour
peach
mango
and
tangerinelime
come
through
in

taste
finishes
with
a
nice
bite
of
sourness
and
the
somewhat
stronger
alcohol
content
never
really
comes
through
excellently
crafted
brew
definitely
worth
a
shot
for
any
sour
lovers

a
very

complex
enlightening
i
got
distracted
while
drinking
it
and
forgot
to
fill
out
the
taste
section
for
about
15
minutes
its
incredibly
good
wow
this
beer
is
delicious
so
tart
most
cascade
beers
ive
had
so
far
have
been
closer
to
a
flanders
style
so
i
guess
thats
what
i
expected
on
the
contrary
its
a
great
sour
much
like
a
gueuze
flavor
is
very
very
tart
with
tons
of
oakiness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
good
carbonation
and
very
low
booze
is
noticeable
surprising
for
the
abv
listed
again
wow
this
beer
completely
surprised
me
and
is
delicious

d
complementarily
complex
and
tasty
good
beer
not
overly
sour
but
just
well
made
with
a
good
recipe
picked
a
bottle
of
this
up
at
the
local
bottle
shop
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
offerings
from
cascade
drinkability
is
very
good
especially
for
the
abv
nice
sourness
lactic
without
going
overboard
on
the
sweeter
side
which
may
cut
down
on
drinkability
a
little
bit
wishing
there
was
a
little
more
complexity
to
the
beer
but
its
still
quite
tasty
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
you
like
white
grapes
d
medium
to
high
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
super
at
the

this
is
a
really
fine
beer
that
i
am
so
glad
is
fairly
easily
accessible
for
me
even
at
the
fairly
pricey
point
of
16
a
750
i
will
be
buying
a
few
of
these
for
future
consumption
and
ordering
this
on
tap
at
future
visits
to
cascade
mouthfeel
was
sparkly
and
just
a
bit
light
in
the
body
strong
beer
gets
a
4
for
drinkability
but
i
loved
this
a
really
unique
and
lovely
beer
we
all
agreed
it
was
a
standout
in
a
fine
tasting
and
id
love
to
get
a
shot
at
this
again
perhaps
with
a
nice
food
pairing
seafood
wonderful
american
wild
from
cascade
im
bringing
sang
royal
to
the
next
tasting
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
mediumyellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
white
wine
and
ginger
ale
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
white
wine
with
some
herbs
including
rosemary
and
ginger
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
alcohol
extremely
well
hidden
love
the
barrels
sir
i
love
the
barrels
overall
impression
this
is
my
idea
of
a
great
wild
ale
no
nasty
brett
but
plenty
of
sour
goodness
and
fruitiness
with
a
touch
of
funk
i
traded
away
my
only
surplus
bottle
but
ill
have
to
correct
that
mistake
the
first
chance
i
get
note
it
really
astounds
me
that
i
pick
up
brett
in
this
beer
as
curtis
seemed
very
insistent
on
not
using
that
in
his
beers
is
this
accidental
well
crafted
beer
a
tough
one
for
me
to
track
down
but
well
worth
the
trouble
drinkability
this
is
a
weekend
beer
for
sure
the
feel
aroma
and
palate
are
all
fantastic
this
is
winner
number
two
from
cascade
im
surprised
their
beers
have
so
few
reviews
44

544
overall
a
mellow
yet
complex
arrangement
that
demands
leisurely
appreciation
just
be
advised
that
the
bottle
will
release
plenty
of
suspended
yeast
as
you
draw
low
on
it
and
thick
gobs
of
it
may
drop
out
at
the
bottom
another
great
sour
from
cascade
superb
balance
drinks
well
some
nice
stuff
here
but
could
use
some
more
complexity
beyond
the
sweet
grapes
clove
and
sour
factor
d
above
average
this
beer
is
pretty
good
overall
but
not
the
best
from
cascade
a
bit
expensive
at
20
super
drinkable
and
not
a
mind
blowing
sour
bomb
lacked
any
vinegar
flavor
at
all
which
i
like
in
a
sour
seriously
a
must
try
for
any
person
wanting
to
try
sours
or
even
a
sour
master
pours
a
murky
muddled
medium
orange
with
a
big
fluffy
but
broken
white
head
that
remains
atop
the
glass
as
its
drank
aroma
is
tart
with
green
apple
and
grapes
with
some
slight
funk
and
vanilla
notes
the
flavor
is
sweet
upfront
and
then
turns
immediately
tart
with
sour
fruit
and
the
sourness
is
fairly
moderate
and
pleasant
its
light
bodied
and
very
crisp
and
effervescent
i
really
find
this
beer
intriguing
its
very
delicate
and
refined
definitely
one
of
the
more
moderate
sours
ive
had
from
cascade
and
is
certainly
another
top
notch
beverage
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
falls
short
very
acetic
and
there
is
a
nice
cinnamon
or
some
other
spice
that
falls
in
the
background
the
floral
scent
appears
in
taste
form
and
is
well
done
this
beers
is
full
in
flavor
but
lacks
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
too
sharp
and
dry
for
liking
which
comes
from
the
white
grapes
i
could
however
drink
this
one
all
night
long
overall
an
impressive
beer
from
the
cascade
series
alot
of
people
might
slam
this
because
it
isnt
the
most
sour
palate
thrashing
beer
around
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
and
delicate
beer
and
is
certainly
a
tart
brew
i
would
be
willing
to
bet
the
brewer
acheived
almost
exactly
what
they
wanted
to
with
this
there
is
great
balance
between
tart
dryness
and
white
grape
flavor
i
would
love
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
to
see
how
it
does
with
a
bit
of
age
an
interesting
beer
and
one
i
would
certainly
drink
again
what
the
hell
edit
if
you
let
this
beer
warm
up
to
room
temperature
the
medicinal
flavors
really
die
down
allowing
more
of
white
grape
tartness
to
come
through
d
im
not
as
inclined
to
go
back
for
another
as
compared
to
some
of
the
bullfrog
and
rr
sours
but
its
not
like
im
going
to
turn
down
another
glass
d
very
nice
beer
reminded
me
of
a
poor
mans
cuvee
de
castleton
which
is
still
impressive
no
hint
of
the
9
2
abv
at
all
though
all
their
beers
hide
the
abv
quite
well
this
is
a
far
departure
from
the
sang
royale
i
had
the
other
day
it
doesnt
have
nearly
the
finesse
or
balance
that
that
one
had
but
it
is
still
pretty
tasty
an
interesting
beer
i
can
see
this
appealing
quite
a
bit
to
some
people
but
i
dont
seem
to
be
one
of
those
people
unfortunately
sampled
at
the
brewery
with
ron
and
curtis
thanks
again
for
the
awesome

no

which
seems
hard
to
believe
for
a
beer
over
nine
percent
smooth
and
full
of
unique
fruit
flavor
look
forward
to
having
again
grab
a
bottle
when
you
can
nice
mouthfeel
overall
highly
recommended
this
beer
stands
up
to
any
of
the
big
highly
touted
grape
based
sour
beers
i
will
definitely
try
to
score
some
more
of
this
one
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
lambics
ive
ever
had
wellbalanced
and
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
nice
beer
but
id
like
it
a
little
lighter
drier
and
more
sour
which
i
think
it
will
become
in
time
although
this
is
probably
their
least
sour
beer
young
another
winner
from
cascade
though
tasty
and
totally
unique
as
usual
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
tarter
and
sourer
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
and
im
interested
to
see
how
it
develops
over
time
this
may
not
drink
quickly
but
it
drinks
very
nicely
the
light
muscat
sweetness
and
moscato
dasti
carbonation
breaks
up
the
funk
enough
to
avoid
that
pucker
that
is
satisfying
yet
on
some
level
a
little
painful
i
enjoy
that
this
is
not
a
traditional
sour
and
the
muscat
is
a
great
call
it
gets
better
with
warmth
off
the
deep
end
and
lovin
every
minute
of
it
slightly
coppered
golden
hue
with
a
big
velvetty
lighttan
head
aroma
is
lightly
tart
touch
of
grapes
bit
of
light
caramel
and
a
hint
of
oak
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
a
big
flanders
red
with
a
wonderful
balance
of
malts
and
tarts
but
with
a
grape
presence
replacing
the
cherries
layers
of
flavors
bouncing
around
and
playing
off
each
other
include
light
caramel
grapes
biscuit
oak
tangerines
and
lemons
these
are
definitely
some
sour
grapes
i
am
enjoying
spiced
sour
blonde
ale
blended
and
aged
in
oak
with
an
ale
containing
white
grapes
insane
very
light
in
color
like
a
straight
lambic
less
sour
and
funky
than
dry
and
tart
white
wine
is
a
great
comparison
the
grape
produces
more
tropical
fruit
notes
starfruit
and
kiwi
most
noticeably
there
is
a
hint
some
bitter
citrus
too
i
believe
some
sort
of
citrus
peel
is
among
the
spices
although
there
is
no
obvious
dry
spicing
the
beer
finishes
smooth
though
with
the
eventual
emergence
of
more
traditional
sour
beer
flavor
over
the
winey
dryness
the
alcohol
is
unimaginable
strangely
or
perhaps
its
lost
to
the
complexity
of
flavors
i
need
another
bottle
of
this
all
to
myself
in
order
to
savor
and
wrap
my
mind
around
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
some
time
head
and
shoulders
above
cuvee
de
castleton
o
didnt
know
what
to
expect
after
waiting
so
long
to
open
this
it
is
fantastic
definitely
reminds
me
of
consecration
complex
and
robust
flavors
really
smooth
and
delicious
verdict
a
very
nice
sour
beer
from
cascade
certainly
one
of
their
finer
endeavors
plenty
of
red
wine
smooth
and
mellow
in
flavor
not
too
cripplingly
sour
but
with
nice
a
pucker
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
despite
the
darker
base
and
higher
abv
definitely
worthy
of
the
accolades
more
winelike
than
sour
but
i
like
it
still
lactic
pinot
mouthfeel
is
mild
and
nice
overall

lacto
medium

where
as

i
also

the

came

more
in

still

is
light

is
very
good

the

overpowers
the
flavors

i

cherries

some
woody

but
the
sour

acid
notes
overpower
the
rest
this
takes
away
from
my

overall
a

with
a

exceptional
well

i

pours
a

dark
red
beer
forms
very
little

at
the
top
smell
is
yeasty
funky
sour
taste
is
typical
of
cascade
brewing
very
sour
and
a
bit
over
the
top
this
beer
has
to
be
shared
as
all
other
cascade
beers
body
is
medium
thickness
and
even
though
a
couple
glasses
can
be
enjoyed
it
is
better
to
share
this
one
keep
antiacid
close
by
an
8
oz
pour
at
the

barrel
house
on

as
close

as

a
must
have
4
00
d
very
good
beer
didnt
get
much
bourbon
but
thats
probably
a
good
thing
since
it
didnt
need
any
other
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
just
an
awesome
beer
its
hard
not
to
say
that
its
my
favorite
from
cascade
but
its
been
awhile
since
i
had
the
apricot
regardless
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
manages
to
be
aggressively
sour
without
being
a
tooth
enamelpeeling
chore
to
get
through
an
excellent
balance
of
the
acidity
and
sweetness
my
brother
is
a
deadset
champion
for
sharing
this
bottle
with
me
its
one
of
those
beers
ive
been
after
for
years
but
my
travels
or
trades
havent
gotten
me
there
what
a
rare
treat
it
is
wine
and
bourbon
sharing
the
barrel
influence
of
this
burgundy
sour
beer
accentuated
with
tart
cherries
i
would
put
this
one
on
par
with
any
of
the
russian
river
dark
sours
and
i
think
it
needs
to
be
mentioned
in
that
breath
its
almost
purple
in
color
darkened
to
a
rich
ruby
wine
shade
and
showing
about
an
inch
of
really
light
lace
head
cherry
is
evident
from
first
sip
tart
pie
style
cherries
in
there
mixing
with
the
bacteria
cultures
and
the
wine
tannins
its
a
really
mouth
watering
nose
the
whiskey
part
comes
more
towards
the
finish
in
this
beer
more
hot
oak
than
vanilla
with
just
enough
char
to
slow
it
down
to
be
savored
the
body
isnt
real
big
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
the
flavor
complexities
ride
and
appear
one
by
one
on
the
sour
waves
which
are
dominated
by
lacto
but
not
entirely
some
brett
in
here
too
i
have
to
imagine
there
is
some
funk
in
there
with
the
acid
it
warms
up
to
show
even
more
wine
properties
pinot
for
sure
its
usually
tough
for
me
to
identify
a
grape
varietal
in
a
beer
especially
from
a
barrel
but
i
think
its
unmistakable
here
cherries
never
get
sweet
even
exacerbating
the
already
extremely
sour
feel
to
this
carbonation
is
mellow
but
more
isnt
wanted
for
the
process
and
the
execution
of
this
beer
are
both
something
to
behold
it
never
shows
its
alcohol
strength
and
at
room
temperature
sips
like
a
fine
glass
of
port
or
something
cant
say
enough
about
this
one
a
crown
jewel
in
the
increasingly
crowded
fruited
sour
world
o
another
well
done
beer
by
cascade
if
these
werent
so
expensive
id
buy
them
more
often
cracked
a
bottle
of
this
recently
for
my
birthday
a
truly
superb
beer
that
showcases
the
excellent
balances
of
this
brewery
nicely
tart
but
with
a
depth
of
lush
fruit
and
a
firm
backbone
of
barrel
aging
the
sour
cherries
in
this
are
mouthwatering
and
the
bourbon
adds
such
a
nice
complexity
a
masterpiece
overall
cascade
probably
the
most
consistent
sour
producing
brewery
out
there
ive
had
this
in
the
past
and
prior
i
got
more
of
a
sour
bomb
with
heavier
lactic
component
this
is
still
amazing
hasnt
changed
much
this
goes
in
the
top
5
flanders
reds
ive
ever
had
pairs
amazingly
with
a
cave
aged
gruyere
o
i
didnt
particuarly
like
the
flavours
in
this
beer
but
i
did
find
it
interesting
so
i
gave
it
a
higher
overall
score
pours
a
murky
burgundytinged
mahogany
capped
by
a
light
beige
one
and
half
finger
head
excellent
retention
and
significant
lacing
oak
light
lactic
sour
wisps
of
general
dark
fruitiness
and
berrylike
accents
opens
with
both
sour
and
sweet
cherries
plums
and
cranberries
very
light
brown
sugar
and
molasses
join
in
pleasant
oaky
accents
throughout
finishes
with
juicy
cherry
tart
and
sour
continued
pleasant
oak
and
just
a
tiny
hint
of
underlying
bourbon
notes
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
its
hard
to
find
a
brewery
in
the
u
s
putting
out
better
sours
than
cascade
and
sang
noir
is
one
of
their
best
truly
exceptional
pours
a
brownish
body
which
sounds
plain
but
is
anything
but
strong
blackberries
currants
and
cherries
are
accentuated
in
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
very
nicely
body
is
quite
lively
and
tartness
isnt
overdone
but
felt
first
time
trying
these
guys
and
i
will
come
back
for
sure
lots
of
complexity
wood
and
cherry
are
down
in
the
mix
making
it
that
much
more
harmonious
wellintegrated
sour
if
not
quite
magical
2012
project
first
beer
for
me
from
cascade
based
on
high
recommendations
from
fellow
bas
very
pleasant
aroma
and
for
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
could
not
stop
from
enjoying
it
before
every
taste
loved
the
sweetness
and
sour
cherries
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
9

snuck
up
on
me
im
so
glad
i
had
ordered
more
than
one
cant
wait
to
try
this
brew
again
after
some
aging
on
my
other
bottles
enjoyed
it
so
much
i
burnt
my
dinner
m
medium
bodied
high
carb
sang
is
a
beautiful
cherry
mahogany
color
on
the
pour
the
nose
is
grenadine
sang
is
more
restrained
sourwise
than
the
other
cascades
ive
tried
and
all
the
better
for
it
no
need
to
grab
for
the
tums
the
cherry
and
oak
interlace
perfectly
and
the
bite
of
sour
cherries
is
rounded
out
nicely
by
the
malt
i
had
a
supplication
last
night
so
its
interesting
to
compare
the
two
supplication
is
more
complex
but
sang
is
an
excellent
beer
othis
is
a
great
beer
and
easily
the
best
wildsour
beer
i
have
tried
in
a
while
it
is
complex
with
a
great
balance
of
earthy
sweet
and
sour
flavors
the
cherry
character
here
is
really
well
done
as
it
permeates
the
beer
but
never
overwhelms
it
the
mouthfeel
comes
closest
of
almost
any
american
sour
beer
i
have
tried
to
matching
the
feel
of
the
best
belgian
sours
will
happily
drink
this
any
time
pours
a
brownishreddish
color
with
a
small
white

aroma
is
of
tart
funk
lots
of
tart

light

funk
sourness
some

and
not
much
of
a
sign
of

very

overall
a
very
nice
treat
sourness
is
perfect
not
over
done
at
all
all
the
flavors
blend
together
just
perfectly
olet
this
beer
warm
up
it
becomes
more
sour
and
the
balance
improves
a
solid
sour
overall
fans
of
lip
puckering
sourness
will
love
this
recommended
overall
one
of
the
better
cascades
ive
had
really
great
beer
glad
i
got
another
of
last
years
vintage
odits
tasty
but
its
not
worth
the
cost
and
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
somewhat
effervescent
yet
meets
everything
expected
of
a
fruited
sour
i
really
enjoy
tasting
the
barrel
character
in
sours
blended
with
the
fruit
addition
i
would
drink
this
again
thin
head
on
a
murky
amber
and
copper
body
aroma
of
apricot
raisin
oak
cherry
and
caramel
flavor
includes
a
perfect
degree
of
sour
dark
fruit
oak
red
wine
caramel
and
earthiness
when
you
drink
this
one
really
let
it
sit
on
your
palate
to
enou
the
sour
degree
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
brief
review
for
an
outstanding
beer
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
will
always
remain
a
must
try
overall
very
good
to
almost
great
solid
sour
that
is
a
must
for
sour
fans
o
a
great
sour
that
i
received
in
a
trade
if
you
have
a
chance
to
acquire
it
i
recommend
it
to
sour
lovers
thank
you
bill
highly
recommend
cascade
sang
noir
black
blood
indeed
drinks
like
some
kind
of
dark
mystical
gospel
a
beer
this
intricate
and
transcendental
is
the
stuff
of
folkloric
legends
of
course
given
how
difficult
it
is
to
find
and
expensive
to
buy
it
may
only
ever
be
fantasy
for
most
people
for
those
of
you
fortunate
enough
to
come
across
this
dream
beer
be
sure
to
enjoy
it
with
someone
you
really
want
to
impress
i
e
your
favourite
person
in
the
world
o
sort
of
like
a
black
cherry
warhead
in
a
sense
with
a
less
intense
sour
pucker
zingy
and
tart
with
some
sweetness
from
the
barrel
nice
beer
this
beer
is
good
had
next
to
other
beers
in
the
style
and
it
was
better
in
many
ways
nice
o
this
is
probably
a
top
2
sour
for
me
to
date
absolutely
superb
and
hard
to
find
flaws
in
unless
you
cant
handle
really
tartsour
beers
o
a
superb
showing
of
what
fruit
oak
and
sourness
can
do
together
when
blended
expertly
so
very
sour
but
so
very
good
and
welcomed
with
the
incoming
of
warmer
weather
very
easily
my
favorite
cascade
to
date
overall
one
of
the
best
sours
and
best
beers
for
that
matter
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
this
is
an
example
of
the
art
of
barrel
aging
at
its
finest
despite
the
high
price
tag
ill
definitely
seek
this
out
again
d
really
nice
sour
beer
great
balance
of
sourness
and
barrel
character
one
of
my
first
wild
ales
and
one
that
i
will
not
forget
it
definitely
leaned
towards
the
sour
side
but
was
wellbalanced
and
not
too
puckery
the
appearance
and
taste
were
both
outstanding
poured
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
lacing
lasted
until
the
last
sip
and
really
helped
capture
the
aromas
worth
trying
if
you
can
manage
to
find
deep
blood
red
light
tan
head
with
good
lace
and
nice
retention
nose
is
bourbon
cherry
pie
sharp
acidity
oak
and
cherry
pits
harsh
acidity
but
the
bourbon
smooths
things
out
taste
has
light
bourbon
oak
an
intense
sour
cherry
blast
tart
acidic
and
more
cherry
pits
finishes
sweetish
but
tartness
prevails
rich
intense
cherry
character
and
a
lovely
malt
profile
medium
full
feel
lasting
finish
awesome
a
cherry
attack
following
an
invitation
of
funk
and
cherry
in
the
aroma
a
lasting
head
and
spider
lace
above
average
mouthfeel
mild
acidity
its
nothing
compared
to
the
sours
we
had
today
a
pretty
perfect
beer
great
and
dangerous
drinkability
liams
bottle
thanks
overall
it
reminds
me
of
a
bit
of
apple
butter
character
and
a
toned
down
weyerbacher
riserva
still
decent
even
for
a
one
tricky
pony
like
sense
a
very
well
made
sour
just
wish
i
was
more
of
a
fan
of
the
style
so
you
can
probably
bump
my
grade
up
a
notch
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
reddish
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
thin
and
not
much
lacing
the
beer
has
lots
of
carbonation
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
tart
oak
and
sour
cherry
aromas
are
subtle
but
definitely
in
there
the
taste
of
it
is
also
sour
some
sharp
cherry
notes
in
the
fading
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
clean
and
tart
nice
high
level
of
carbonation
that
dries
the
beer
out
overall
its
a
good
brew
not
typically
my
style
but
its
a
good
brew
this
beer
is
really
balanced
in
flavors
with
the
vinegar
sourness
and
lasting
bitterness
sticking
their
necks
out
among
the
other
flavors
the
oakiness
is
there
but
not
over
the
top
in
addition
i
cant
detect
the
high
abv
at
all
and
the
buzz
comes
slowly
as
this
is
a
sipper
i
was
strangely
underwhelmed
but
then
i
realized
its
because
there
is
no
one
stand
out
feature
due
to
the
balance
nature
i
wouldnt
age
this
too
long
as
the
oak
will
fade
completely
o
awesome
sour
beer
if
you
are
fan
of
sours
this
is
a
must
get
o
lovely
beer
but
not
as
amazing
as
the
score
would
make
it
seem
maybe
i
just
need
more

smelled
great
lots
of
cherries
and
some
minor
bourbon
notes
tasted
amazing
slight
sourness
and
bourbon
on
the
front
with
a
more
distinct
sour
and
cherry
notes
rounding
out
the
finish
cherries
throughout
amazing
for
sure
the
best
american
sour
ive
ever
had
d
a
solid
dark
sour
thats
sufficiently
complex
but
doesnt
really
blow
me
away
id
certainly
have
this
again
if
offered
but
id
take
russian
rivers
dark
sours
over
this
pretty
much
every
time
o
great
sour
certainly
among
the
better
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
there
are
some
interesting
complexities
to
it
that
arent
found
in
many
other
wilds
o
thankfully
the
aroma
is
nothing
like
the
flavor
because
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
a
lot
more
than
the
aroma
ended
up
being
a
very
enjoyable
brew
appearance
is
cloudy

taste
is
very
tart
up

with
plenty
of

notes
the
finish
is
plenty
sour
with
an
adition
of
some
earthy
character
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
nice
unique
brew
with
plenty
of
tartness
and
fruity
character
overall
this
brew
is
a
very
good
wild
ale
the
cascade
crew
knows
how
to
do
them
there
are
some
nice
slight
bourbon
notes
mixed
in
with
intense
tart
notes
great
sour
fruit
with
some
slight
vinegar
and
some
nice

there
is
a
nice

down
smells
of

lemon

light

note
and
a
touch

the

is

up

i
get
some
sweet

and
a
light
sweet

tart
cherries
a

lemons
destroy
the
sweetness

ale
very
complex
maybe
i
should
have
asked
for
more
than
one
bottle
enjoyed
this
one
alot
drinkability
a
decent
wild
ale
but
a
touch
more
sour
than
i
like
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
i
felt
that
the
aroma
was
far
superior
to
the
flavor
because
the
cherry
aspect
was
so
fantastic
and
the
tartacidic
quality
seemed
a
bit
overwhelming
i
would
strongly
recommend
drinking
this
sooner
than
later
o
this
stuff
is
really
tasty
overall
this
is
an
incredibly
deep
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
wine
notes
along
with
the
sourness
id
definitely
have
more
in
the
future
t
a
nice
lactic
sourness
upfront
thats
chock
full
of
sour
cherries
cherry
pit
and
vanilla
a
touch
of
bourbon
before
a

thats
long
and
ever
changing
pinot

red
delicious

o
great
worth
the
hype
it
would
have
been
all
5s
if
the
individual
flavors
had
been
more
distinguishable
i
am
a
fan
of
this
o
this
is
possibly
my
favorite
from
cascade
so
far
glad
i
shared
it
though
i
think
the
sourness
could
get
overwhelming
if
you
drink
the
whole
bottle
excellent
beer
though
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
overall
the
merging
of
bourbon
barrel
and
pinot
barrels
in
the
aging
process
of
this
beer
produced
a
whole
new
kind
of
beast
i
will
absolutely
seek
this
out
again
overall
for
the
sake
of
my
wallet
i
almost
wish
id
never
encountered
this
beer
i
usually
like
cherry
beers
but
this
manages
to
create
a
big
and
interesting
natural
cherry
flavor
without
being
candylike
at
all
im
gushing
this
beer
is
great
o
very
nice
this
is
a
good
amount
more
sour
and
less
barrely
than
i
remember
it
on
draft
the
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
nice
and
refreshing
very
enjoyable
this
is
pretty
tasty
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
tartness
there
is
so
much
going
on
in
this
beer
and
i
think
this
may
actually
be
a
flaw
this
could
use
some
simplicity
its
very
sour
and
very
tasty
but
a
little
crazy
one
of
the
better
wilds
from
cascade
lots
going
on
my
mouth
is
a
desert
moisture
is
gone
pours
medium
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
gorgeous
smells
of
different
fruits
however
cherry
jumps
out
and
is
the
most
potent
tastes
like
a
cherry
blowpop
with
the
dry
back
end
of
a
cherry
blowpop
as
well
very
tart
and
sour
and
well
put
together
fantastic
taste
my
only
knock
is
the
carbonation
to
me
this
is
over
carbonated
and
wouldve
been
much
nicer
with
a
less
carbonated
creamier
mouthfeel
still
nice
but
not
what
it
could
be
that
being
said
this
is
fantastic
kind
of
one
sided
as
far
as
the
cherry
goes
but
i
think
that
was
the
point
id
trade
for
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
overall
a
really
nice
fruit
forward
american
wild
and
one
of
the
better
cascade
beers
ive
had
although
i
find
their
sours
unbalanced
a
lot
of
the
time
this
was
definitely
enjoyable
refreshing
and
complex
but
the
aroma
was
a
bit
much
upfront
i
like
this
but
i
think
there
are
more
enjoyable
sours
for
the
price
sang
noirs
flavor
hits
like
a
sour
slap
to
the
dome
blending
complex
tartness
with
disparate
food
characters
at
once
brown
sugar
green
apple
balsamic
vinegar
and
milk
chocolate
can
be
detected
swirling
the
mediumbodied
brew
about
the
mouth
activates
both
moderate
fizziness
and
high
acidity
with
the
sharp
bacteria
gripping
the
tongue
like
tiny
rock
climbers
the
swallow
brings
the
oak
a
huge
vinous
blast
peppered
with
sour
cherry
lemon
and
vinegar
granny
smith
apple
peel
and
bing
cherries
blend
in
the
finish

o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
easily
is
one
of
the
better
wild
ales
i
have
had
the
sweetnees
and
the
sourness
balance
very
well
given
everything
that
is
going
on
in
the
beer
cant
wait
to
have
some
more
d
i
like
this
but
im
not
blown
away
the
cherry
is
very
natural
and
well
done
and
reminds
me
of
rr
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
mild
but
sharp
carbonation
stinging
the
tongue
really
deep
and
flavorful
beer
that
really
attacks
your
taste
buds
overall
this
was
a
super
surprise
for
me
in
a
good
way
i
was
intially
hesitant
on
this
beer
because
i
am
not
a
fan
of
cherries
in
beer
but
i
think
more
and
more
that
it
is
that
artifical
cherry
flavor
associated
with
some
krieks
or
beers
like
mad
elf
this
has
real
dark
sour
cherry
fruit
flavors
mixed
with
the
oak
induced
bourbon
and
vinous
flavors
which
complement
each
other
quite
well
not
as
stellar
as
sang
royal
but
a
slouch
my
no
means
o
a
good
beer
overall
i
wish
the
flavor
was
as
complex
as
the
aroma
but
its
still
quite
good
verdict
one
of
the
best
sours
from
cascade
who
is
arguable
the
united
states
premier
sour
maker
such
a
great
blend
of
rich
deep
flavors
from
the
bourbon
and
tart
fruit
from
the
wine
barrels
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
though
cascade
has
had
a
long
history
of
making
very
solid
fruit
sours
this
is
no
exception
and
in
fact
may
be
the
best
of
the
bunch
ive
had
yet
an
incredible
beer
all
around
overall
this
one
didnt
come
cheap
but
id
like
to
pick
up
another
bottle
if
you
can
get
this
one
i
highly
recommend
doing
so
tart
puckering
medium
body
with
a
strong
red
wine
barrel
presence
dry
toasted
oak
with
subtle
lactic
funk
and
a
ton
of
vinous
sweet
fruit
hints
of
grape
tart
cherry
and
other
dark
berries
provide
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
to
counter
the
sourness
slight
acidity
but
not
harsh
or
solvent
like
tart
and
dry
with
lingering
acetic
vinegar
presence
that
leaves
me
drooling
formore
decent
amount
of
sourness
but
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
sang
noir
goes
out
pretty
dark
red
almost
faded
black
but
more
of
a
badly
burnt
brown
color
shifting
towards
red
an
off
white
head
that
is
short
lived
with
no
stick
smell
is
pretty
promising
a
nice
amount
of
oak
underlined
with
some
bourbon
tomes
and
wet
wood
some
small
berry
scent
with
some
lactic
funk
rising
up
taste
is
tart
leading
in
with
big
wood
oak
small
bourbon
dark
cherry
and
a
lot
of
lactic
sourness
in
the
end
perhaps
too
much
the
beer
pretty
much
stays
neutral
from
cold
to
room
temp
the
feel
is
medium
and
has
some
bubbles
the
lactic
blast
is
felt
when
getting
this
down
the
gullet
though
it
causes
heartburn
quite
unsettling
this
is
tasty
beer
yet
a
bit
too
bitey
for
me
a
3rd
of
the
bottle
was
plenty
pretty
purple
ale
with
some
light
pink
surface
bubbles
up
front
in
the
nose
for
me
are
the
bing
cherries
and
pinot
notes
nice
and
full
bodied
with
a
hint
of
ink
and
cassis
some
hints
of
alcohol
and
oak
alongside
leather
and
sweat
i
like
the
already
the
flavor
carries
more
of
the
grape
than
id
anticipated
refined
plummy
and
juicy
a
bit
of
booze
maybe
whiskey
comes
through
just
in
the
back
end
but
as
an
accent
and
overture
really
nice
medium
bodied
with
moderate
on
hi
carb
i
like
this
beer
just
ordered
four
bottles
o
excellent
would
have
again
im
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
very
dark
sours
but
this
one
didnt
display
any
roasted
notes
to
me
only
real
downside
was
it
may
be
more
delicious
if
it
were
7
abv
instead
of
nearly
10
22
per
750ml
from
the
brewery
o
the
first
beer
i
have
had
from
cascade
and
i
am
a
big
fan
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
beers
in
the
future
kinda
dig
the
bourbon
coming
through
underneath
the
sourcherry
flavor
the
pour
is
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smells
of
red
wine
oak
and
red
wine
vinegar
with
a
light
balsamic
character
some
dark
fruit
aromas
are
also
present
such
as
raisin
plum
and
black
cherry
quite
tart
on
the
palate
with
good
fruit
notes
of
cherry
and
plum
the
red
wine
character
is
strong
and
there
is
lots
of
tannic
oak
to
it
lactic
tartness
a
hint
of
red
wine
vinegar
and
a
mild
leather
note
another
good
one
from
cascade
this
is
simply
an
outstanding
fruit
sour
it
has
a
hefty
dose
of
sour
but
its
not
enamelstripping
and
the
real
highlight
is
the
balance
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
and
i
really
cant
think
of
how
i
would
improve
on
it
delicious
o
this
beer
is
excellent
this
is
my
second
time
having
it
the
first
time
i
didnt
really
like
it
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
revisit
because
it
is
phenomenal
grab
this
if
you
can
bottle
o
i
tried
but
failed
to
pick
up
bourbon
but
what
i
did
get
out
of
this
beer
was
stunning
and
i
might
start
touting
this
as
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
o
moderateheavy
sourness
big
cherry
raspberry
concord
grape
and
lactic
characteristics
unfortunately
there
isnt
very
much
oak
apparent
and
barely
any
bourbon
just
a
hint
in
the
throat
if
youre
really
searching
for
it
pinot
noir
characteristics
are
there
a
phenomenal
wild
ale
and
holds
up
with
the
best
of
them
the
only
down
side
is
that
this
is
a
powerfully
acidic
brew
after
a
while
and
you
feel
it
you
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
without
it
starting
to
hurt
but
oh
god
is
this
good
its
so
damn
good
o
this
is
really
tasty
the
bourbon
notes
are
very
subtle
more
apparent
in
the
aroma
than
the
taste
and
the
huge
tart
cherry
aspect
is
great
not
much
funk
but
still
quite
complex
o
this
is
really
good
sour
pleasant
to
drink
worth
the
price
overall
a
bold
flavorful
sour
ale
that
comes
together
well
great
depth
and
complexity
o
i
found
their
kriek
too
be
enjoyable
but
a
bit
simple
this
just
puts
that
beer
to
absolute
shame
what
an
amazing
use
of
cherries
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
any
belgian
kriek
or
even
fruit
lambic
that
i
have
tried
as
the
whiskey
and
pinot
barrel
notes
are
just
so
smooth
and
seem
to
compliment
the
bing
cherries
world
class
beer
for
sure
overall
another
amazing
cascade
beer
worth
every
penny
o
overall
this
is
a
stellar
wild
alesour
the
whiskey
really
adds
something
nice
to
this
the
only
downfall
is
how
damn
expensive
this
bottle
is
that
all
said
its
delicious
absolutely
delicious
o
one
of
the
best
sours
forget
american
wilds
that
ive
had
takes
the
top
spot
for
me
in
the
consecration
category
seek
and
destroy
this
beer
the
taste
is
sour
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
cherries
and
bourbon
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
rich
malty
backbone
to
balance
out
the
beers
initially
tart
mouthfeel
the
aftertaste
is
strictly
tart
cherries
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
and
worth
trying
however
its
tough
to
justify
27
for
any
beer
that
you
would
consume
regularly
o
an
incredible
beer
the
tart
cherries
and
sweet
malt
and
bourbon
flavors
work
together
perfectly
this
was
a
real
treat
very
drinkable
and
complex
enjoyed
as
a
part
of
my
27th
birthday
evening
big
thanks
goes
out
to
dprouty
who
sent
me
this
one
in
a
recent
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
teku
poured
a
dark
ruby
redorange
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
cherry
tart
sour
wood
fruit
vinegar
and
subtle
raspberry
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wood
fruit
sour
tart
tart
cherry
and
very
subtle
vinegar
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
one
definitely
brought
quite
a
bit
of
pucker
power
to
the
party
the
aroma
was
pretty
nicely
balanced
which
made
it
really
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
really
glad
i
got
to
enjoy
this
one
even
it
was
a
full
bottle
an
absolute
must
try
for
any
sour
fan
out
there
o
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
right
there
with
brute
and
supplication
i
was
bummed
at
the
price
but
its
definitely
worth
it
if
you
like
sours
overall
i
love
this
sour
it
has
lots
of
oak
and
a
solid
fruit
flavor
a
winner
and
a
beer
that
i
can
justify
paying
the
25
a
bottle
for
o
7
510
sour
factor
this
is
a
great
sour
with
the
big
green
apple
aroma
and
taste
and
just
enough
sour
to
go
with
it
overall
tried
four
cascadessang
nior
sang
royal
the
vine
kriek
at
our
tasting
last
night
and
this
was
the
clear
winner
by
a
landslide
its
up
there
with
one
of
the
best
sours
that
i
have
drank
overall
i
love
cascade
sours
and
this
is
no
exception
lactic
sourness
lots
of
oak
and
a
solid
fruit
flavor
a
winner
as
usual
yum
yum
the
cherries
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
ass
day
one
of
the
better
sors
ive
had
in
awhile
thanks
egrace84
o
a
really
nice
american
wild
that
we
destroyed
in
minutes
between
4
of
us
i
have
a
couple
bottles
left
so
im
excited
to
see
how
this
will
progress
with
some
age
right
now
good
stuff
and
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
flandersesque
beers
o
definitely
was
exceptional
all
around
and
to
me
was
really
similar
to
the
bourbonic
plague
really
glad
i
got
to
taste
this
one
peace
to
my
boy
beezler
who
brought
this
down
to
socal
o
well
worth
the
money
at
22bottle
wellbalanced
is
an
understatement
the
huge
sour
presence
is
complimented
by
a
strong
oak
taste
and
subdued
by
a
subtle
cherry
sweetness
as
far
as
style
similar
to
pays
du
soleil
from
saint
somewhere
expect
a
bit
more
malt
body
in
this
one
cheers
o
a
little
pricey
but
well
worth
it
im
just
getting
into
sours
and
this
one
gave
a
nice
interesting
twist
on
how
i
perceive
them
ive
basically
only
had
fruit
lambics
from
cantillon
before
this
and
it
was
nice
to
see
an
almost
brown
ale
aspect
built
into
the
sourness
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
stuff
from
cascade
overall
this
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
when
its
cold
its
all
cherry
flavor
as
it
warms
the
wine
comes
out
and
the
body
becomes
more
appealing
upon
a
second
drink
of
this
beer
im
more
an
more
impressed
by
its
complexity
the
barrels
each
add
separate
dimensions
and
the
fruits
are
dynamic
superb
sour
overall
very
tasty
beer
that
i
found
more
complex
than
other
cascade
offerings
but
still
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
this
is
one
of
the
best
flemish
styled
reds
that
ive
had
a
wonderful
beer
that
encapsulates
what
a
sour
is
all
about
big
sour
cherry
fruit
bomb
with
a
barrel
but
not
bourbon
backing
comparable
to
cantillon
or
russian
river
blueberry
overall
sometimes
less
is
more
this
beer
may
be
a
bit
much
and
could
use
a
little
less
the
marrage
of
all
the
flavors
is
not
seamless
but
still
works
well
in
any
event
i
have
really
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
cant
believe
it
made
it
to
my
market
really
really
enjoyed
this
101214
tried
another
bottle
of
the
same
vintage
at
a
tasting
definitely
nice
bourbon
presence
coming
through
now
adds
some
alcohol
heat
but
mellows
the
sourness
a
bit
and
melds
well
drink
it
was
very
tasty
glad
i
have
a
bottle
to
sit
on
for
a
bit
to
let
flavors
meld
a
little
bit
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
for
a
while
and
it
definitely
lived
up
to
expectations
one
of
the
more
complex
sours
ive
had
every
sip
was
something
new
and
delicious
the
evolution
of
it
from
slightly
chilled
to
room
temperature
was
also
good
as
different
elements
shone
through
more
at
various
temps
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
im
very
impressed
with
what
cascade
has
made
here
they
sure
do
know
their
sit
this
is
a
pretty
easy
beer
for
me
to
really
get
into
cherries
sourness
mild
barrel
character
that
is
way
in
the
background
o
good
cherry
tartness
so
nice
and
lovely
o
an
exquisite
biscuity
flanders
in
the
style
of
red
poppy
also
some
great
flavor
contribution
from
barrels
improving
drinkability
you
would
never
guess
this
had
9
2
alcohol
if
it
wasnt
written
on
the
bottle
cherries
and
oak
atop
the
sour
base
deliciousness
seriously
this
is
fantastic
dont
know
what
else
to
say
except
that
i
need
a
case
of
this
stuff
asap
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
sweetsour
cherry
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
the
same
and
strikes
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
and
sour
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
sour
with
some
great
cherry
aromas
and
flavors
that
are
nicely
balanced
o
very
drinkable
and
the
flavours
are
very
complimentary
an
excellent
sour
2011
vintage
pours
a
very
murky
reddish
purple
brown
color
with
a
medium
yellowish
cream
color
scent
is
quite
acidic
at
first
very
vinous
with
a
good
amount
of
cherries
and
chocolate
sweet
dark
fruits
with
a
bit
of
funk
not
a
whole
lot
though
im
very
impressed
with
the
chocolatecovered
cherry
aroma
with
a
nice
tart
twist
on
it
some
brandy
aromas
as
well
taste
is
a
pleasant
acidic
tart
chocolate
flavor
at
first
which
turn
to
sweettart
cherry
such
complexity
to
this
beer
i
am
blown
away
right
now
nice
bourbon
brandy
flavors
with
oak
and
cherry
reminds
me
of
a
quad
with
some
oaky
sourness
outstanding
flavor
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
with
a
sweet
puckering
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
from
a
brewery
that
continues
to
produce
amazing
sour
beers
wowza
what
a
beer
a
real
sour
lovers
specimen
with
plenty
of
intensity
and
complexity
highly
cellerable
for
sure
clear
crimson
body
with
a
head
that
crackles
away
quickly
smells
strongly
of
bourbon
and
acetic
acid
with
an
unpleasant
metallic
note
that
dissipates
as
the
beer
warms
up
vinegar
seems
dominant
over
the
typical
cascade
lacto
character
cherries
are
barely
present
on
the
nose
the
palate
is
similar
very
bourbonheavy
and
rather
sweet
with
milder
vinous
notes
and
a
hint
of
cherry
stomachchurning
acidity
is
pervasive
and
makes
this
beer
a
chore
to
drink
after
2
or
3
oz
pretty
harsh
and
unrefined
stuff
but
not
bad
overall
a
great
beer
pours
a
hazed
dark
brown
ruby
with
a
transient
thin
head
of
tan
bubbles
not
much
lace
or
retention
nose
as
dominated
by
vinegar
and
tannins
cherry
vanilla
and
light
acetic
notes
red
wine
and
cherry
are
forefront
in
flavor
with
an
underlying
acidity
and
oak
with
mild
vanilla
sweetness
medium
light
body
soft
carbonation
acidic
finish
this
was
adequately
sour
and
fruity
but
not
on
par
with
consecration
easier
to
obtain
bottles
are
welcome
but
ill
be
too
lazy
to
bother
with
ordering
any
based
on
this
sample
im
off
to
my
gourmet
beer
shop
tomorrow
to
buy
them
out
on
this
happy
birthday
weekend
o
this
beer
will
not
disappoint
absolutely
fantastic
sour
ale
similar
to
the
rr
consecration
but
better
the
pinot
and
bourbon
barrels
add
a
unique
and
charming
character
to
this
beer
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
a
4
year
vertical
and
this
one
really
changes
with
age
word
is
that
they
will
be
bottling
later
this
spring
you
will
want
to
get
several
bottles
some
for
now
and
some
for
a
few
years
down
the
road
one
of
if
not
the
best
sour
ale
made
in
america
today
brilliant
at
once
complex
delicious
and
approachable
pretty
seamless
with
no
rough
edges
o
overall
a
very
good
wild
ale
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
cascade
has
an
awesome
sour
nose
to
it
though
i
didnt
get
much
bourbon
at
all
would
love
to
have
it
again
overall
tasty
but
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
this
one
strong
beer
thin
to
medium
in
body
sweet
mildly
up
front
with
a
winy
oaky
finish
decent
throughout
great
beer
but
not
earth
shattering
overall
a
really
solid
beer
i
had
waited
a
long
time
to
be
able
to
grab
this
one
and
it
delivered
at
the
same
time
i
think
it
could
have
been
a
truly
great
beer
with
a
bit
more
whiskey
character
in
the
blend
sort
of
a
cherry
adam
from
the
wood
with
red
wine
and
acidity
still
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
the
beer
is
ruby
to
copper
colored
with
a
small
quickly
vanishing
head
the
aroma
brings
sour
cherries
bourbon
oak
smells
tart
the
flavor
carries
more
oak
and
is
tannic
in
nature
the
bourbon
is
there
but
cherries
and
a
tart
sourness
are
the
primary
flavors
acetic
finish
with
some
alcohol
presence
similar
to
russian
river
consecration
a
beer
of
which
i
am
very
fond
very
tasty
overall
i
am
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
a
great
mix
of
red
wine
and
oak
flavor
follows
the
nose
great
mix
of
sour
and
red
wine
flavors
pretty
similar
to
consecration
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
from
cascade
but
not
quite
worthy
of
the
high
praise
it
has
received
o
outstanding
o
i
have
only
been
let
down
by
cascade
once
and
this
is
not
it
another
homerun
overall
great
example
of
a
souramerican
wild
ale
really
nice
to
see
the
differences
between
the
years
great
beer
rock
on
cascade
thanks
biscuit
for
the
great
barrel
bevs
overall
awesome
beer
killer
fruit
presence
combined
with
the
wine
and
whiskey
barrels
drinks
like
a
beer
half
its
abv
highly
recommended
edit
from
121310
visit
to
the
barrel
room
was
told
that
they
are
now
out
of
the
2009
edition
but
had
just
put
on
the
2010
version
while
fairly
comparable
to
the
2009
version
the
fresh
2010
version
comes
across
as
a
bit
more
acidic
and
sour
theres
still
more
than
enough
going
on
for
me
to
enjoy
this
excellent
beer
but
as
im
not
a
huge
sour
fan
i
found
myself
longing
for
the
2009
version
which
i
thought
showed
a
bit
more
fruit
and
vanilla
and
was
not
quite
as
sour
regardless
theres
no
doubting
that
this
is
one
fine
beer
from
the
folks
at
cascade
d
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
and
would
still
want
more
it
would
be
especially
excellent
on
a
hot
day
with
the
sound
of
a
mandolin
being
gently
strummed
and
the
slow
steady
creak
of
a
wellused
rocking
chair
on
a
hot
summer
day
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
had
better
than
the
others
in
the
sang
series
i
think
though
very
close
to
the
sang
royale
awesome
stuff
that
i
feel
quite
lucky
to
have
tried
a
couple
snifters
of
at
belmont
station
im
more
and
more
impressed
with
cascade
every
beer
i
have
this
was
the
standout
of
the
evening
with
the
other
two
beers
at
the
event
noyeaux
and
the
manhattan
transfer
also
showing
very
very
well
d
i
was
sad
when
it
was
all
over
wish
this
one
was
bottled
one
of
the
best
wilds
i
have
ever
had
and
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
for
that
matter
fantastic
beer
from
a
great
brewery
pours
a
nice
blackdark
burgundy
with
a
solid
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
at
first
cherry
and
grapes
dominate
the
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
blackberry
but
as
it
warmed
a
great
wood
began
to
dominate
this
was
a
nice
sweet
beer
balanced
incredibly
well
with
the
sourness
this
had
a
little
wild
carbonation
but
a
nice
long
sour
finish
as
this
got
warmer
the
beer
became
more
and
more
complex
as
various
flavors
came
out
this
was
the
highlight
of
sourfest
for
me
and
i
sampled
it
three
times
throughout
the
day
to
make
sure
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
12
finger
tan
head
good
retention
reddish
brown
opaque
body
trails
of
carbonation
rising
up
side
of
glass
nose
is
huge
frickin
cherry
hit
up
front
more
sour
than
sweet
little
if
any
hops
with
oak
notes
becoming
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warmed
taste
is
cherry
domination
tart
funky
sweet
some
oakiness
all
in
balance
an
incredibly
complex
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
not
a
lot
of
effervescence
not
sticky
despite
the
sweetness
drinkability
is
high
despite
the
abv
just
a
crazy
tasty
beer
thirty
months
of
barrel
aging
along
with
the
sublime
blending
of
ron
gansberg
one
of
americas
best
wile
ale
brewers
results
in
this
truly
amazing
beer
an
absolute
must
for
aficionados
of
the
style
very
highly
recommended
sang
noir
by
cascade
brewing
is
a
barrel
aged
sour
brewed
with
cherries
and
8
abv
it
poured
a
pitch
red
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
black
it
smelled
of
cherries
brett
and
sweet
malts
it
tasted
sweet
and
sour
with
cherry
goodness
malt
and
oak
notes
it
was
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
but
i
am
a
fan
of
cascade
and
any
sours
so
im
partial
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
at
toronado
its
a
very
dark
ruby
red
almost
opaque
with
pink
head
little
lacing
smells
heavy
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
delicious
very
tart
it
has
lots
of
chery
fig
and
raisin
flavors
but
is
not
sweet
at
all
mixes
in
well
with
the
wood
flavor
from
the
barrels
the
mouth
feel
is
very
pleasant
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
this
go
down
smoothly
its
crazy
how
smooth
this
beer
is
for
10
abv
drinkability
is
insanely
good
this
is
their
best
beer
ive
had
yet
im
a
big
fan
of
sour
darks
and
this
one
really
kills
it
the
intense
flavor
hides
the
strong
abv
making
this
one
potentially
very
dangerous
mild
sour
some
funk
nice
blend
of
apricots
and
raspberries
the
balance
is
rather
good
wow
worth
the
price
if
you
are
a
sour
connoisseur
delicious
huge
alcohol
ester
smell
underneath
that
you
get
raspberry
the
taste
is
where
its
at
on
this
hits
you
right
in
the
corner
of
the
jaw
short
finish
makes
you
want
to
keep
drinking
it
glad
i
snagged
this
before
they
shut
down
online
sales
this
beer
is
pristine
and
smooth
delectable
tart
raspberries
with
some
hints
of
oak
here
and
there
some
lemon
tartness
adds
into
the
mix
and
some
earthy
notes
come
through
as
well
i
shouldve
bought
more
of
this
beer
another
gem
from
cascade
although
i
dont
really
know
what
i
was
expecting
with
peach
nut
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
anything
like
peaches
and
is
in
fact
rather
nutty
and
sweet
almost
like
and
almond
while
the
tartness
of
fresh
raspberries
add
to
the
tartness
of
an
already
very
lactic
sour
beer
and
the
port
wine
adds
a
rich
booze
kick
and
thicker
texture
to
call
this
complex
is
a
gross
understatement
but
unlike
the
sangs
this
one
doesnt
resolve
quite
as
well
i
dont
think
the
fruit
seems
intense
i
find
myself
looking
for
the
peach
nut
which
i
dont
even
know
what
that
is
supposed
to
taste
like
so
im
assessing
it
weirdly
i
need
to
learn
to
relax
on
analysis
and
just
drink
a
beer
i
dont
understand
the
fruit
is
great
raspberries
are
subtle
but
bring
the
best
out
of
the
barrel
treatment
the
alcohol
is
a
little
sharp
in
the
finish
but
its
a
nice
cut
to
the
fruity
sweetness
the
grain
seems
heavier
in
this
one
too
fuller
bodied
and
more
dense
white
port
is
not
something
i
am
real
familiar
with
but
i
still
taste
red
grape
here
maybe
a
skinless
wine
not
sure
but
its
a
neat
twist
on
the
palate
as
a
beer
on
the
whole
this
is
genius
but
its
not
a
real
good
one
to
dissect
being
foreign
to
the
main
ingredient
a
touch
more
carbonation
would
lift
it
a
little
but
i
like
the
slow
unwrapping
of
it
all
cascade
is
no
doubt
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
at
these
inventive
wild
beers
maybe
below
my
expectations
but
those
may
have
been
ignorantly
founded
beautiful
beer
worthy
of
its
high
praise
and
then
some
o
cascade
does
not
cease
to
amaze
me
apricot
raspberry
and
oak
blend
expertly
well
i
could
drink
this
all
day
erry
day
overall
another
good
one
from
cascade
and
well
worth
seeking
out
however
as
is
typical
for
them
this
is
a
more
clean
and
fruit
forward
sour
so
dont
go
in
expecting
something
funky
overall
its
intense
good
flavors
but
really
really
sour
for
me
the
tartness
in
this
beer
overpowered
the
fruit
and
wood
characteristics
a
little
disappointing
absolutely
loved
this
the
apricot
and
raspberry
work
beautifully
together
the
fruit
flavors
are
balanced
perfectly
great
color
plenty
of
tartness
an
8
oz
pour
at
the
cascade
barrel
room
on
8192014
the
second
of
four
beers
i
had
while
at
the
barrel
room
first
being
sang
noir
golden
with
a
tinge
of
red
clear
very
similar
to
sang
noir
despite
the
lighter
color
more
acidic
and
lighter
bodied
nice
play
between
the
fruit
sweetness
cherry
sourness
and
oak
acidity
light
body
and
low
carbonation
shared
at
the
swamp
head
batch
600
release
pours
a
funky
reddish
brown
color
with
fluffy
white
head
on
top
that
sticks
around
a
bit
for
a
sour
brew
beautiful
aroma
of
apricots
and
strawberries
some
definite
vinegar
and
acidic
notes
to
go
with
it
flavor
follows
the
aroma
perfectly
with
juicy
raspberries
and
tart
apricots
and
some
expected
sour
vinegar
flavors
to
go
along
the
body
is
juicy
and
finishes
dry
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
easily
the
best
sour
ive
had
from
cascade
who
has
been
a
mixed
bag
for
me
my
two
favorite
fruits
in
a
sour
come
together
beautifully
here
drink
it
was
a
good
beer
a
tad
for
what
it
was
i
am
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
a
bottle
since
i
missed
this
one
when
i
was
at
cascade
last
year
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
touch
of
gold
a
thin
white
head
that
starts
and
remains
at
the
edges
aroma
has
a
good
amount
of
oak
and
apricot
with
a
bit
of
sour
red
fruits
and
light
acid
flavor
starts
with
more
raspberry
and
sourness
with
a
bit
of
apricot
towards
the
finish
and
an
acid
note
that
grows
throughout
ended
up
being
very
sour
not
particularly
complex
and
that
is
probably
due
to
its
age
i
dont
know
how
it
was
cellared
since
2011
but
it
is
delightfully
sour
and
worked
well
as
a
palate
cleanser
in
a
pinch
i
get
the
sense
that
this
beer
used
to
be
more
than
this
though
and
would
probably
recommend
trying
this
beer
fresh
i
totally
missed
the
fruit
in
this
one
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
carbonated
really
threw
me
i
just
had
a
bottle
of
this
last
week
and
it
was
carbonated
so
im
not
sure
what
happened
the
good
news
was
that
the
beer
was
still
quite
good
just
a
different
experience
i
was
definitely
fooled
taste
this
one
does
not
disappoint
plenty
of
fruit
character
plenty
of
tart
fruit
notes
apricot
and
sourness
wheat
some
minor
amount
of
cherry
flavor
with
a
stronger
raspebrry
presence
in
the
mouthfeel
throw
in
more
and
more
citrus
sourness
and
acidity
this
is
not
a
mild
sour
by
any
means
carbonation
is
powerful
hides
the
alcohol
wonderfully
o
pretty
good
and
definitely
enjoyable
a
cut
above
some
of
their
other
offerings
that
said
you
couldnt
get
me
to
pay
the
asking
price
for
a
bottle
overall
a
real
enjoyable
cascade
brew
very
enjoyable
i
had
no
idea
what
this
was
i
have
had
noyaux
twice
in
the
last
two
months
and
i
dont
remember
it
tasting
like
this
at
all
the
other
two
bottles
all
had
more
carbonation
than
this
one
did
so
we
were
thinking
slight
leakage
maybe
an
ok
beer
overall
but
for
what
cascade
puts
out
this
isnt
one
of
their
better
offerings
a
bit
flat
and
way
too
acidic
and
tart
i
feel
like
the
sour
really
covers
all
the
complexities
of
the
fruit
they
tried
to
use
here
where
am
i
supposed
to
taste
the
toasted
apricot
seed
meat
cool
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
revisit
this
taste
is
also
sharply
sour
with
vinegary
traces
of
acetic
acid
in
the
mix
fruity
sour
notes
blending
seedy
raspberry
into
other
indistinct
sour
fruit
notes
bright
and
crisp
with
a
very
acidic
edge
to
it
carbonation
is
moderate
and
it
finishes
dry
with
some
traces
of
wet
wood
in
the
aftertaste
overall
pretty
nice
and
a
bit
more
complex
that
the
standard
fruited
sour
ales
in
their
lineup
verdict
a
very
pleasant
sour
from
cascade
which
is
no
surprise
it
has
quite
a
nice
fruit
profile
and
the
wine
influence
is
a
great
subtle
touch
the
complexity
is
there
and
the
balance
is
nice
but
this
is
a
fairly
aggressively
sour
brew
that
isnt
really
all
that
delicate
o
super
acidic
and
tart
but
nice
raspberry
flavors
do
show
up
o
graet
sour
on
of
my
favorite
well
worth
actively
seeking
out
overall
this
was
delightful
a
terrific
beer
from
cascade
cost
25
for
a
750
ml
bottle
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
recent
random
sunday
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
apricot
fruit
sour
and
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
apricot
tart
sour
and
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
honestly
did
not
know
what
to
expect
going
into
this
one
as
i
had
heard
of
it
but
not
really
paid
it
any
attention
however
what
i
found
was
really
quite
excellent
the
apricot
notes
in
this
one
were
really
nice
and
very
refreshing
this
made
it
quite
drinkable
despite
the
major
tart
aspect
going
on
a
really
nice
surprise
that
showed
up
at
the
tasting
that
evening
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
or
seeing
how
it
develops
with
a
little
time
in
a
proper
cellar
o
this
is
a
really
nice
raspberry
sour
the
raspberry
flavor
isnt
huge
like
ng
rasperry
tart
but
there
is
just
enough
to
compliment
the
puckering
sourness
another
great
beer
from
cascade
overall
one
of
the
better
tasting
sours
from
cascade
imo
really
enjoying
this
one
and
wish
i
had
bought
several
more
bottles
overall
quite
nice
a
very
good
sour
great
fruit
and
barrel
flavors
etc
o
excellent
sour
by
cascade
ive
loved
everything
ive
had
by
them
so
far
highly
recommended
taste
well
definitely
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
a
while
full
on
delicious
sour
raspberry
notes
followed
by
a
soft
lingering
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
superb
the
sweetness
stays
on
the
palate
and
does
a
folk
dance
across
my
tongue
it
really
wont
go
away
nice
singe
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
upon
sipping
sour
notes
and
a
clean
sour
bite
hit
you
while
the
sweet
raspberry
flavors
play
around
and
hang
around
long
after
you
swallow
this
excellent
brew
i
shall
certainly
be
ordering
more
from
cascade
well
this
was
just
lovely
id
be
pleased
to
find
this
in
my
glass
any
day
or
night
maybe
this
cascade
thing
will
grow
on
me
excellent
excellent
beer
o
overall
this
was
an
awesome
beer
super
stoked
i
got
to
try
it
big
fan
of
cascade
beers
and
i
love
raspberry
so
i
knew
this
would
be
solid
wish
i
had
another
one
served
in
hill
farmstead
stemware
pinkish
orange
body
fizzy
white
head
with
no
lace
extremely
tart
unmistakably
cascade
tart
raspberry
apricot
sugar
highly
acidic
sour
apple
waves
of
vinous
notes
im
a
cascade
fanboy
but
fruit
is
my
bag
baby
dig
this
o
exceptional
beer
all
the
way
around
and
definitely
glad
i
have
more
to
crack
open
at
my
dispose
geeahh
in
the
vein
of
most
other
cascades
lactic
sourness
with
fruit
probably
about
middle
of
the
road
in
terms
of
the
cascade
fruit
sours
ive
had
some
complexity
is
there
but
raspberry
overshadows
some
other
flavor
nuances
still
tasty

o
tasty
stuff
in
the
style
of
cascades
other
sour
beers
i
like
the
combination
of
fruit
and
the
barrel
treatment
adds
a
nice
element
sourness
is
a
bit
fatiguing
and
can
limit
the
drinkability
while
this
isnt
their
most
sour
beer
its
a
damn
good
one
very
well
balanced
with
a
real
good
tartness
to
it
as
well
t
raspberry
jam
apricot
flesh
some
tart
mango
a
good
dash
of
lactic
sourness
without
ever
becoming
too
sour
tart
plum
and
some
oak
really
good
stuff
overall
this
was
another
very
solid
american
wild
ale
from
cascade
but
i
think
it
may
be
a
bit
green
right
now
the
lactic
presence
is
pretty
abrasive
and
may
need
some
more
time
to
mellow
in
the
bottle
for
the
flavors
to
develop
i
feel
these
blonde
based
fruit
beers
are
best
at
around
9
months
in
the
bottle
but
maybe
that
is
just
me
i
put
these
beers
in
a
high
regard
so
maybe
i
am
alaways
expecting
too
much
after
sampling
all
the
best
ones
not
as
spectacular
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
super
solid
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
cascade
quickly
climbing
my
favorite
brewers
list
there
is
a
great
combination
of
flavors
with
some
nice
woody
notes
this
is
an
amazing
brew
with
mix
of
raspberry
and
apricot
flavors

o
a
damn
delicious
beer
so
far
i
havent
had
anything
from
cascade
that
wasnt
excellent
and
this
is
up
there
with
sang
noir
with
my
favorites
from
them
the
use
of
noyaux
is
really
awesome
and
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
had
before
this
is
a
really
great
beer
the
beer
pours
like
a
can
of
seltzer
would
with
a
loose
white
head
that
fades
as
quickly
as
it
forms
without
lacing
the
body
appears
to
be
a
cloudy
dull
rusty
amber
with
a
nose
reminiscent
of
vinegar
berries
in
this
case
raspberries
and
cherries
and
no
distinct
notes
of
toasted
noyaux
the
beer
drinks
with
a
lot
more
fruit
forward
sweetness
than
expected
followed
by
a
tart
dry
yet
sweet
palate
washing
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
tart
and
semisweet
its
definitely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sours
ive
had
since
figaro
id
recommend
trying
this
beer
its
at
least
worth
a
try
m
medium
bodied
big
thanks
to
boralyl
for
getting
this
out
my
way
served
in
a
cascade
goblet
pours
a
peach
color
with
a
light
pinkish
tint
the
nose
has
aromas
of
raspberry
and
light
apricot
along
with
a
pretty
heavy
lactic
presence
flavor
is
quite
pungent
and
very
acidic
mostly
lactic
but
a
touch
of
acetic
fruit
character
is
fairly
mild
a
pink
hued
golden
ale
with
a
loose
surface
of
greywhite
foam
smells
of
raspberries
bits
of
marzipan
and
a
little
oak
really
reminds
me
of
cantillon
rose
de
gambrinus
some
hints
of
almond
taste
is
crazy
sour
ripping
my
enamel
sour
raspberries
are
in
there
but
fuck
this
is
sour
some
acetic
quality
but
tons
of
lemon
and
hints
of
apricot
in
the
back
end
thin
beer
with
low
carb
and
a
dry
finish
but
the
tartness
makes
me
salivate
pavlovian
style
crazy
beer
light
body
with
a
slight
prick
of
carbonation
pretty
tasty
beer
d
a
solid
beer
and
one
id
drink
again
but
not
my
favorite
cascade
offering
the
acidity
seems
oddly
disconnected
from
the
extremely
fruity
and
sweet
flavor
perhaps
a
bit
more
time
developing
in
the
bottle
with
improve
things
d
not
as
hugely
rich
as
id
hoped
the
fruit
blend
here
is
nicer
in
the
aroma
and
is
a
bit
more
restrained
in
the
taste
amber
with
a
dense
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
lactic
and
sour
with
a
moderate
acetic

plenty
of
berry
character
is
present
nice
the
palate
opens
fatty
rancid
greasy
with
a
blend
of
raspberries
cherries
and
blackberries
mildly
buttery
this
is
oily
and
greasy
poor
imo
o
i
think
this
is
my
2nd
favorite
beer
from
cascade
first
one
being
nightfall
quite
pricey
though
at
25
a
bottle
seek
this
one
out
o
had
this
one
immediately
following
a
sang
noir
so
the
comparisons
are
inevitable
noyaux
had
a
better
nose
to
it
but
sang
noir
tasted
better
offering
up
more
fruit
and
a
better
balance
overall
a
nice
beer
but
not
one
that
i
think
id
want
a
whole
bottle
of
appearance
is
cloudy
yellow
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
somewhat
musty
with
a
huge
dose
of
earthiness
with
tons
of
apricot
and
oak
taste
is
very
tart
up
front
with
a
nice
amount
of
sweetness
oak
is
a
little
lighter
on
the
taste
than
the
nose
cherry
apricot
and
oak
come
through
the
strongest
overall
very
nice
with
to
a
of
flavor
overall
this
is
a
really
awesome
cascade
sour
i
am
definately
a
fan
of
cascade
sours
they
have
done
this
beer
right
as
expected
really
like
this
one
per
usual
with
cascade
thanks
a
bunch
4daloveofstout
bought
two
bottles
of
this
may
need
to
buy
more

very
nicelooking
beer
scent
is
wonderful
good
amount
of
acidic
stone
fruit
and
fresh
raspberry
wow
such
ripe
fruit
aromas
raspberries
are
more
in
the
nose
than
any
apricot
or
other
fruit
aromas
winelike
aromas
chardonnay
taste
is
immediately
reminiscent
of
a
dry
chardonnay
but
with
a
ton
of
raspberry
flavor
the
raspberry
flavor
is
not
forced
or
out
of
place
though
very
fresh
and
complimentary
to
the
flavor
acidic
but
only
for
the
sake
of
great
fruit
flavor
this
beer
sure
does
have
some
great
fruit
flavor
mainly
raspberries
but
as
it
warms
up
you
get
apricots
nectarines
plumots
and
a
hint

overall

is
just
killing
it
with
the

genre
never
had
a
bas
sour
beer
from
them
i
will
continue
to
support
this
brewery
if
they
continue
to
put
out
delicious
gems
like
this
one
im
hesitant
to
age
my
other
bottle
considering
how
tasty
the
fruit
profile
is
right
now
o
this
beer
is
a
fruit
bomb
and
very
sour
i
really
liked
how
the
combination
of
raspberries
and
noyaux
worked
just
a
really
great
beer
one
of
cascades
more
intense
beers
very
nice
but
some
funky
brett
would
really
blow
this
one
out
of
the
water
overall
if
you
like
sours
you
will
want
to
try
this
absolutely
delicious
beer
to
sum
things
up
noyaux
may
be
the
best
cascade
brew
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
and
none
that
ive
had
came
close
to
disappointing
me
a
big
thumbs
up
to
cascades
brewing
efforts
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of

of
the
beer

drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
berry
apricot
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
super
tart
and
acidic
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
fantastic
flavors
that
make
it
a
treat
to
drink
in
retrospect
probably
should
have
had
this
beer
before
the
bourbonic
plague
regardless
this
was
another
exceptional
beer
from
cascade
pours
a
goldenorangish
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
sour
berry
fruits
lacticlike
yeast
and
surprisingly
a
very
noticeable
almondlike
note
from
the
apricot
nut
dry
palate
very
sour
and
puckering
and
very
astringent
the
raspberry
lent
towards
fruit
tones
but
didnt
stand
out
as
raspberry
the
noyeaux
made
an
appearance
towards
the
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
high
this
is
an
amazing
beer
d
a
perfect
companion
on
a
hot
evening
what
i
fondly
refer
to
as
a
porchsipping
beer
simply
a
pleasure
to
drink
drinkability
truly
an
amazing
awa
complex
and
enjoyable
another
huge
win
in
the
sour
department
this
is
up
at
the
top
of
my
favorite
sours
from
them
i
cant
wait
to
see
their
lineup
expand
even
more
very
good
stuff
but
it
probably
took
3rd
place
at
the
event
behind
sang
noir
and
manhattan
transfer
unique
stuff
thats
different
from
anything
else
ive
had
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
market
saturation
of
american
wilds
is
producing
a
lot
of
highquality
beers
this
isnt
in
the
top
tier
but
its
enjoyable
enough
to
be
in
the
next
one
d
for
an
8
5
brew
that
smacks
of
all
things
tart
and
funky
well
its
pretty
damn
drinkable
the
subtlest
boozy
glow
but
really
the
test
is
how
much
wildness
ones
palate
can
accept
the
1012
oz
in
this
glass
was
plenty
good
in
a
short
sitting
but
i
couldawouldashoulda
enjoyed
another
had
i
had
more
time
to
spare
worth
seeking
one
finger
frothy
white
head
medium
dissipation
with
some
lacing
present
throughout
pink
grapefruit
colored
cloudy
body
a
bit
of

the
nose
is
dominated
by
the
raspberries
a
bit
of
raisins
from
the

taste
is
the

healthy

a

very
dry

dangerous
at
this
abv
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
very
tasty
another
winner
from
cascade
home
of
americas
best
sour
beers
the
flavor
is
of
slightly
tart
apricots
raspberries
oranges
and
white
grapes
with
a
light
acidity
and
a
fairly
clean
lactic
sourness
a
slight
musty
quality
is
evident
sweetness
is
at
a
moderate
level
and
i
notice
a
faint
nuttiness
carbonation
was
very
low
but
the
acidity
adds
some
texture
another
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
from
cascade
d
cascade
really
makes
some
great
sour
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
a
fantastic
wild
ale
that
i
hope
to
try
again
at
some
point

going
down
the

a
shame
somewhat
unpleasant
phenolic
bandaid
aftertaste
dominates
the
finish
turning
a
very
delightful
and
delicate
beer
the
wrong
direction
very
sour
reminds
me
of
a
blueberry
mead
i
made
once
very
low
carbonation
but
the
body
is
neutral
long
sour
aftertaste
i
have
had
slightly
more
intense
sours
than
this
though
this
is
not
mild
at
all
the
simple
acidic
jammy
fruits
mixed
with
the
barrel
is
great
all
around
really
enjoyable
b
overall
a
solid
blueberry
sour
im
typically
a
big
fan
of
cascades
sours
but
this
one
had
a
very
strong
phenolic
flavor
bandaids
which
almost
ruined
it
for
me
deep
purple
in
color
translucent
with
a
slightly
hazy
appearance
due
to
the
carbonation
large
creamy
white
head
that
dies
down
quickly
leaving
a
thin
uneven
layer
of
foam
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
great
sweet
and
sour
aroma
you
can
smell
the
sweet
fruit
followed
by
a
noticeable
musty
sour
finish
taste
starts
with
a
fruity
blueberry
flavor
followed
by
a
sour
and
slightly
dry
finish
very
thirstquenching
light
to
medium
body
slightly
fizzy
from
the
large
amount
of
light
carbonation
overall
a
very
unique
beer
the
best
blueberry
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
this
is
getting
worse
and
worse
like
drinking
straight
paint
thinner
just
terrible
nope
o
blueberry
is
overpowered
by
sourness
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
beer
from
cascade
but
one
takeaway
from
the
ones
i
have
had
is
that
these
guys
may
well
be
the
king
of
fruit
their
apricot
is
just
divine
and
this
blueberry
is
just
as
well
done
deep
dark
purple
in
color
all
from
the
fruit
i
can
see
a
probable
blonde
beer
base
underneath
but
the
stain
from
the
berries
is
deep
a
nose
thats
more
sour
than
it
is
fruity
with
lots
of
mellowing
oak
and
then
the
fruit
punch
complex
of
the
blueberries
which
are
as
tart
as
they
are
sweet
the
flavor
follows
a
similar
format
sourness
first
mostly
on
the
front
end
before
the
fruit
ramps
up
the
berries
do
add
some
sugar
that
isnt
all
the
way
fermented
out
which
i
like
because
its
a
nice
balance
to
the
sourness
i
think
the
true
flavor
of
the
blueberry
here
is
as
authentic
and
prominent
as
the
apricot
although
i
think
the
apricot
it
a
better
beer
the
use
of
fruit
and
brewing
expertise
on
display
is
the
same
jammy
middle
before
the
wood
softens
the
finish
its
earthy
and
summery
and
reminds
me
of
a
place
i
would
like
to
be
out
in
a
blueberry
patch
in
august
gorging
myself
until
my
face
and
hands
are
stained
purple
a
special
beer
the
best
blueberry
beer
ive
ever
had
by
leaps
and
bounds
pours
a
dark
purple
with
a
nice
finger
inch
white
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
a
tad
sour
with
some
fruit
blueberries
for
sure
taste
starts
out
fairly
tart
but
does
dissipate
quick
the
fruit
takes
over
and
there
is
a
good
blueberry
flavor
to
this
one
though
it
doesnt
linger
on
the
palate
slight
sourness
at
the
back
end
pretty
good
medium
carbonation
medium
bodied
pretty
tasty
recommended
overall
certainly
not
the
best
that
cascade
has
made
i
do
not
recommend
this
one
overall
another
fantastic
one
from
cascade
in
my
limited
experience
they
are
really
good
at
knocking
out
the
single
fruit
sour
beers
like
this
one
and
the
kriek
cherry
and
apricot
blueberry
is
especially
great
because
of
the
unique
look
it
imparts
on
the
beer
from
the
coloring
as
well
as
the
natural
tartness
of
blueberries
im
only
a
tad
curious
to
know
how
this
one
mightve
tasted
closer
to
the
bottling
date
but
based
on
how
good
it
is
a
year
old
id
gladly
take
a
bottle
of
any
vintage
that
was
offered
overall
cascade
has
a
way
with
sour
fruit
beers
always
enjoyable
to
try
them
pours
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
purple
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
nice
blueberry
fruit
character
mildly
tart
woody
mild
acidity
some
earthy
notes
and
light
funk
the
flavor
is
moderate
blueberry
fruit
wood
lightly
acidic
mildly
tart
with
some
earthy
qualities
this
is
not
overly
sour
and
doesnt
have
the
massive
fruit
punch
of
a
belgian
red
but
this
is
still
tasty
and
definitely
worth
trying
o
probably
the
best
blueberry
ive
had
with
the
best
example
of
blueberry
flavor
imparted
in
a
beer
more
flavor
came
through
than
expected
well
done
overall
ive
had
this
beer
multiple
times
but
somehow
never
reviewed
it
quality
sour
as
always
a
nice
drinking
sour
i
had
to
come
back
and
add
this
to
the
review
as
it
warms
up
and
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
the
blueberry
comes
out
still
not
as
sour
as
i
would
of
hoped
for
but
it
still
is
young
i
like
it
more
the
more
i
drink
it
o
this
is
a
great
sour
but
not
my
favorite
from
cascade
apricot
the
blueberries
add
an
incredible
visual
flair
to
this
beer
but
not
much
else
i
was
underwhelmed
with
their
presence
in
the
aroma
and
taste
of
the
beer
i
wish
i
could
taste
the
blueberries
more
but
the
acid
kinda
blows
them
out
in
a
blind
taste
test
id
have
a
hard
time
believing
anybody
would
identify
this
as
a
blueberry
beer
one
other
minor
complaint
i
have
is
the
carbonation
level
it
was
a
bit
too
high
on
this
beer
for
my
taste
which
is
odd
considering
i
didnt
find
that
with
the
apricot
overall
a
highly
recommended
sour
but
not
the
best

yet
another
damn
good
sour
from

im
somewhat
partially
to
blueberry
stuff
as
blueberries
are
higher
up
on
the
list
of
fruits
and
fruit
flavors
i
really
enjoy
blueberries
tend
to
get
lost
in
some
sour
ales
but
not
here
wonderfully
fruity
heavily
tart
and
painfully
acidic
this
beer
will
make
any
sour
fan
go
nuts
o
very
good
sour
beer
i
was
especially
interested
in
trying
this
being
a
blueberry
lover
and
already
a
fan
of
cascade
sours
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
flavor
character
from
the
fruit
the
sour
overpowered
the
fruit
and
lost
some
of
the
dimension
the
fruit
could
have
yielded
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
super
acidic
and
sour
puckering
with
light
acetic
sharpness
and
a
very
dry
finish
salivary
glands
work
into
overdrive
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
almost
like
sparkling
juice
its
drinkable
and
satisfies
the
sour
fix
though
its
a
little
onedimensional
overall
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
continue
to
be
a
fan
of
american
sours
with
their
cleaner
sharper
sour
notes
than
their
belgian
counterparts
at
least
in
my
experience
not
as
heavy
on
the
blueberry
as
i
would
have
preferred
but
i
would
certainly
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
this
is
a
fantastic
fruit
sour
wellbalanced
and
showcasing
both
the
blueberries
and
sour
in
complementary
ways
something
about
cascades
sours
really
resonates
with
me
and
this
is
another
big
hit
this
is
my
first
experience
with
cascade
and
im
certainly
excited
to
try
more
ive
had
a
lot
of
sours
that
really
make
you
pucker
lately
and
i
love
them
but
this
is
nice
and
balanced
more
in
the
realm
of
raspberry
tart
than
my
blueberry
nightmare
overall
a
nice
sour
from
cascade
would
be
great
for
beginners
and
veteran
sour
fans
alike
overall
i
really
liked
it
but
not
quite
as
much
as
i
was
hoping
i
would
i
love
blueberry
and
wanted
a
touch
more
fruit
flavor
but
overall
it
was
a
very
solid
brew
love
that
a
couple
more
are
a
click
away
if
i
want
them
love
this
beer
its
one
of
the
best
from
cascade
and
its
usually
pretty
easy
to
find
i
really
like
that
i
can
actually
taste
the
blueberry
and
know
that
its
not
some
fake
flavoring
that
theyre
real
blueberries
in
there
and
a
ton
of
them
great
beer
smelled
very
good
but
it
did
not
carry
over
to
where
it
really
counts
also
surprised
by
the
lack
of
actual
blueberry
flavor
very
nice
sour
funky
and
earthy
but
i
think
it
could
use
just
a
little
more
fruit
but
its
a
very
minor
complaint
this
ones
working
well
with
this
warm
june
afternoon
maybe
a
little
to
easy
to
drink
overall
quite
nice
great
fresh
and
tart
blueberries
great
sour
flavor
my
first
cascade
and
i
think
i
picked
a
good
one
to
start
with
great
overall
beer
and
looking
forward
to
grabbing
another
overall
cascade
comes
through
again
really
good
stuff
even
though
it
doesnt
come
cheap
its
definitely
worth
picking
up
or
ordering
from
their
site
massive
fresh
blueberry
flavor
in
this
beer
with
a
great
sour
and
wild
ale
feel
better
than
some
of
the
lambics
that
come
from
brussels
and
you
could
trick
me
if
you
blind
poured
it
for
me
great
tart
fruit
flavor
lingers
like
every
other
cascade
beer
ive
had
this
beer
is
not
on
the
cheap
side
a
beer
of
this
quality
cant
be
cheap
to
make
and
it
shows
it
other
than
that
if
you
like
blueberries
and
sour
beers
you
might
want
to
open
your
wallet
to
this
beer
it
is
certainly
a
unique
beer
bright
bluepurple
looks
rad
with
a
light
head
dense
blueberry
aromas
with
a
concentration
of
deeply
flavored
skins
lots
of
acid
on
the
nose
tart
and
puckering
on
the
palate
not
pulling
a
ton
of
oak
at
first
but
more
as
it
warms
deeply
fruited
with
the
familiar
cascade
acidity
o
great
beer
ive
loved
everything
from
cascade
so
far
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
will
seek
this
out
again
for
sure
t
opens
with
a
nice
tart
hit
of
blueberries
some
lemon
zest
apple
cider
vinegar
raspberry
puree
some
green
apple
and
some
unripe
blueberries
on
the
finish
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
which
was
actually
a
good
thing
a
light
prickly
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
dryness
on
the
finish
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
about
2
years
old
at
this
point
which
i
think
did
it
well
the
blueberry
definitely
isnt
prominent
which
may
have
to
do
with
the
age
but
the
balance
of
berry
flavors
as
well
as
the
funkiness
are
very
well
blended
very
enjoyable
elegant
almost
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
limited
only
by
the
price
which
is
too
high
o
solid
sour
with
a
good
fruit
presence
to
it
and
tartness
that
almost
makes
you
pucker
the
one
sad
part
was
that
i
didnt
get
as
much
blueberry
as
i
did
raspberry
overall
a
run
of
the
mill
cascade
brew
nothing
stands
out
against
their
other
sours
however
stands
out
against
most
other
breweries
its
a
bit
over
priced
for
how
much
a
bottle
goes
for
but
would
be
ideal
to
bring
to
a
tasting
or
bottle
share
o
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
not
quite
as
enjoyable
as
cascade
kriek
and
apricot
overall
pretty
nice
but
mostly
the
appearance
and
the
nose
is
the
mose
impressive
part
my
new
love
affair
with
cascade
begins
this
is
the
third
of
theirs
i
have
tried
including
noyeaux
and
apricot
poured
from
bottle
into
jester
king
farmhouse
glass
pours
a
violetred
hazy
color
a
thin
line
of
head
circles
the
rim
of
the
glass
aroma
vinegar
funk
mixed
with
rose
petal
and
a
blueberry
wafty
ending
reminds
me
of
smelling
smashed
fresh
blueberry
no
artificial
flavors
detected
aroma
is
amazing
taste
some
tart
flavors
but
not
puckeringly
sour
the
fruit
is
very
present
i
get
more
of
that
raw
blueberry
flavor
without
the
sweetness
very
dry
finish
with
some
barnyard
funky
aftertaste
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
much
more
sour
but
this
is
really
a
celebration
of
the
blueberry
flavor
that
stays
true
to
it
without
becoming
cloying
sweet
or
artificial
as
it
warms
more
of
the
funk
comes
out
i
get
a
little
bit
of
band
aid
on
the
end
its
not
distracting
but
you
can
tell
that
brett
worked
a
little
in
here
nice
mouthfeel
i
swear
i
might
have
had
some
blueberry
pulp
in
there
maybe
some
seeds
good
carbonation
i
really
like
this
beer
i
think
its
an
excellent
example
of
a
fruit
beer
but
it
has
a
ways
to
go
before
it
obtains
fruit
lambic
like
sourness
and
acidity
o
another
wonderful
wild
from
americas
best
wild
ale
brewery
simply
amazing
o
this
is
my
first
cascade
and
i
have
to
say
wow
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
love
the
sweet
tart
flavor
without
being
over
the
top
and
it
is
crazy
drinkable
very
impressed
highly
recommend
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
very
bright
red
grape
reddish
purple
with
a
highly
active
one
finger
slightly
pink
head
the
nose
is
bright
and
tart
it
instantly
hits
you
with
fresh
blueberry
juice
a
healthy
dose
of
dry
brett
and
a
nice
level
of
acidity
the
slightly
sweet
blueberry
character
works
well
with
opposing
bretty
funk
it
smells
much
more
authentic
than
the
2011
which
i
found
to
be
too
sweet
and
artificial
the
flavors
are
instantly
dry
and
tart
with
a
lot
of
brett
to
pair
with
the
blueberry
which
has
a
great
blueberry
muffin
aspect
the
acidity
is
perfect
and
provides
a
nice
level
of
sourness
it
drinks
light
with
a
healthy
amount
of
carbonation
it
leaves
both
ends
of
the
flavor
spectrum
in
the
after
taste
which
is
unique
and
fun
to
experience
overall
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
and
i
really
really
enjoyed
it
im
glad
that
this
beer
changed
significantly
from
2011
i
would
definitely
snag
this
one
again
if
possible
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
tartness
and
natural
flavoring
that
is
mildly
tannic
the
blueberry
inclusion
was
felt
more
in
the
nose
than
anything
which
is
understandable
id
have
this
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
overall
a
fine
sour
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
amazing
something
i
could
certainly
drink
alot
of
though
if
it
werent
for
cost
and
availability
recommended
o
didnt
blow
me
away
really
wanted
more
blueberry
and
more
puckering
sourness
even
the
lacto
character
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
had
figured
it
would
be
still
good
just
not
great
overall
another
interesting
wellexecuted
fruit
sour
from
cascade
obetter
than
the
strawberry
a
good
sour
they
seem
to
be
making
good
ones
i
think
i
am
beginning
to
understand
to
understand
a
pattern
with
cascade
sours
they
are
damp
like
a
dirty
wet
waterdamaged
basement
this
is
good
but
the
level
of
musty
is
a
bit
too
much
regardless
this
a
lovely
beer
macerated
blueberry
magic
tart
and
light
and
fruity
could
use
a
bit
more
tart
funkiness
but
its
solid
trying
to
look
for
something
wrong
with
this
beer
and
just
cant
find
it
absolute
perfection
overall
i
like
i
did
expect
to
like
it
more
than
i
did
o
very
tasty
the
lactic
character
threatens
to
make
the
beer
onenoted
but
assertive
flavors
from
the
wood
and
fruit
balance
things
out
o
just
further
proof
to
me
that
cascade
has
easily
one
of
the
top
3
or
4
sour
programs
in
the
states
this
was
the
more
recent
batch
of
this
and
i
see
no
reason
why
i
would
sit
on
it
further
since
the
fresh
fruit
is
what
makes
this
so
good
right
now
so
many
bottles
being
poured
from
a
basket
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
lightly
cloudy
magenta
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offpink
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
funk
mixed
with
sweet
concorde
grapes
that
might
sound
odd
but
it
is
rather
pleasant
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
now
a
strong
current
of
tart
blueberry
flowing
through
the
proceedings
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
that
doesnt
bludgeon
with
the
sour
but
also
doesnt
leave
you
wanting
more
good
times
o
nicely
done
the
beer
is
funky
and
soured
but
never
goes
into
a
stomach
churning
experience
this
beer
was
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
havent
been
disappointed
yet
by
cascades
sour
brews
this
is
no
exception
i
just
wish
i
could
find
some
to
cellar
too
thats
half
the
fun
of
rare
beer
tasting
great
brew
from
cascade
a
yummy
take
on
the
fruit
sours
nice
chalky
and
earthy
with
some
good
fruit
sweetness
and
tartness
and
some
slight
balsamic
notes
4
0
lighter
medium
body
dry
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
decent
enough
feature
of
the
blueberry
but
doesnt
quite
stack
up
to
their
other
fruited
wild
ales
apricot
kriek
etc
d
not
bad
but
i
think
cascade
makes
a
number
of
stronger
offerings
i
probably
should
have
drank
this
immediately
as
the
blueberries
seem
to
have
lost
some
potency
over
the
last
9
months
reminds
me
a
little
of
uplands
blueberry
lambic
easy
to
drink
in
any
case
we
had
no
problem
polishing
off
the
750ml
bottle
if
this
were
cheaper
and
easier
to
obtain
id
probably
keep
a
bottle
of
this
around
at
all
times
overall
very
tasty
and
drinkable
with
a
complex
wild
character
and
refreshing
fruit
flavor
id
definitely
have
this
again
o
overall
this
is
a
very
very
delicious
beer
incredibly
pleased
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
as
this
was
just
top
notch
wish
more
breweries
would
make
blueberry
based
wilds
well
done
cascade
o
a
great
sour
really
like
the
way
they
made
this
one
work
overall
great
balance
between
the
sour
and
the
blueberry
really
enjoyed
this
o
a
really
nice
fruited
sour
as
usual
a
delicious
offering
from
cascade
ill
be
looking
forward
to
getting
this
again
next
year
overall
another
winner
from
cascade
they
really
do
brew
fantastic
sours
o
a
very
easy
drinking
sour
nice
blueberry
flavor
another
great
offering
from
cascade
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yet
vibrant
rose
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
nose
is
a
also
a
quite
vibrant
and
tart
blueberry
which
i
feel
is
distinct
and
true
to
the
fruit
however
the
taste
isnt
nearly
as
distinctly
blueberry
its
an
initial
rush
of
sourness
that
fades
quickly
into
something
sweet
fruity
it
has
an
amazing
mouthfeel
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sourness
lingering
fruit
and
residual
dryness
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
id
definitely
try
again
m
its
a
light
medium
bodied
brew
high
carbonation
makes
it
easy
to
drink
prickly
on
the
tongue
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
split
the
750
but
could
have
easily
downed
the
whole
thing
myself
very
puckering
without
ever
getting
too
sour
and
some
good
bright
berryfruit
flavors
ordered
a
few
more
of
these
after
how
much
the
girlfriend
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
d
another
favorite
of
the
day
could
probably
drink
this
nonstop
seeing
as
blueberries
are
just
about
my
favorite
fruit
should
have
put
a
disclaimer
at
the
front
of
the
review
a
very
nice
sour
it
lacks
a
bit
of
the
funk
im
used
to
in
a
cascade
sour
but
non
the
less
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
sour
would
drink
again
blueberry
isnt
a
fruit
that
imparts
a
great
deal
of
flavor
into
sour
beers
nevertheless
its
presence
is
felt
in
this
one
and
gives
the
tartness
some
nice
character
a
solid
beer
overall
and
one
id
rank
on
par
with
some
of
the
other
american
blueberry
sours
out
there
o
overall
nice
good
blueberry
notes
with
just
a
bit
of
funkiness
this
was
a
disappointment
i
didnt
expect
as
much
brett
funk
but
did
expect
more
blueberry
the
proportions
of
these
two
seemed
reverse
of
what
they
should
have
been
ok
but
certainly
far
behind
other
cascade
sours
ive
tasted
nice
pretty
blueberry
juice
color
with
some
pink
tinted
white
rimming
of
foam
nose
is
blueberry
sour
vinous
grains
surprisingly
grassy
and
back
country
with
hints
of
hay
and
soil
flavor
pulls
out
a
good
sharp
astringent
sourness
with
strong
blueberry
flavors
and
a
good
full
bodied
feeling
with
low
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
a
good
beer
i
would
buy
a
few
bottles
if
available
i
think
i
prefer
the
apricot
over
this
one
overall
though
its
a
drinkable
and
pleasant
brew
the
crisp
acidity
is
not
overwhelming
and
its
smooth
enough
and
bright
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
lowlights
of
the
visit
however
this
one
was
a
part
of
cmrillos
40
beers
40
birthday
bash
shared
by
cmrillo
at
his
own
party
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
ruby
red
pink
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wood
blueberry
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
blueberry
wood
tart
and
sour
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
it
was
stated
at
the
tasting
that
since
steve
kim
wasnt
here
which
meant
no
one
brought
the
blåbær
that
this
one
would
have
to
do
while
it
was
definitely
not
on
the
same
level
it
was
definitely
a
very
nice
brew
that
was
on
par
with
it
and
uplands
version
this
one
was
a
lot
easier
to
get
as
well
which
makes
me
wonder
why
i
didnt
buy
a
case
of
these
when
i
had
a
chance
an
absolute
must
try
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
and
if
you
have
you
already
understand
was
fortunate
enough
to
try
the
experimental
precursor
to
this
beer
the
van
der
jon
berry
but
imho
this
is
clearly
superior
to
that
beer
d
not
as
cool
as
its
scarcity
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
almost
a
kriek
and
very
tasty
yet
another
great
offering
from
cascade
had
it
again
in
late
2012
that
batch
might
be
even
better
than
the
one
i
wrote
the
review
for
182nd
o
it
was
pretty
solid
all
around
but
was
not
as
sour
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
overall
the
blueberry
is
a
tricky
fruit
see
for
yourself
amazing
thanks
archenemybrew
overall
very
good
beer
i
can
tell
that
i
am
getting
use
to
sour
beers
and
enjoying
them
cascade
is
going
to
become
part
of
my
regular
stops
if
they
keep
this
up
4
55
this
just
never
really
won
me
over
i
love
cascade
and
everything
has
been
rock
solid
but
this
just
was
lacking
for
me
o
this
is
the
poor
mans
blåbær
and
that
is
meant
as
a
big
compliment
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
bottle
to
enjoy
throughout
the
rest
of
the
year
drink
now
drink
later
drink
often
drink
better
as
this
one
warms
up
great
layered
flavors
on
this
with
a
lot
of
fruit
and
a
small
sour
i
like
the
smoothness
and
crispness
tasty
tasty
sour
the
fruit
will
probably
fade
over
time
so
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
one
fresh
nice
job
cascade
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
that
is
perfectly
finedrinkable
now
but
i
can
imagine
will
only
improve
over
time
as
the
sourness
will
increase
and
balance
the
fresh
fruit
forward
flavors
o
it
was
what
i
expected
and
more
i
will
have
to
seek
cascades
other
sours
soon
o
near
perfection
so
effervescent
fruity
but
dry
stunning
clear
reddishpurple
topped
by
a
lasting
white
head
great
looking
beer
tart
blueberry
skin
aroma
mildly
sour
with
a
little
sweet
blueberry
flesh
palate
is
balanced
mildly
sour
with
a
pleasant
lacto
character
backing
up
tart
and
sweet
blueberry
notes
its
more
skin
than
flesh
very
clean
light
finish
refreshing
and
enjoyable
but
not
overly
complex
thankfully
doesnt
have
the
stomach
churning
lacto
character
of
many
cascade
sours
pours
a
slightly
murky
red
with
a
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sour
and
tart
blueberries
and
some
funky
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
very
sour
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
sour
beer
with
a
nice
blueberry
presence
overall
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
to
put
it
plainly
less
actual
flavor
than
other
cascade
sours
i
hope
some
age
will
help
this
beer
out
o
how
do
they
keep
cranking
out
these
amazing
beers
cascade
i
am
glad
i
still
get
to
visit
you
o
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
this
bottle
alone
justified
the
purchase
of
the
other
three
bottles
that
are
sitting
in
my
cellar
i
enjoyed
this
beer
so
much
that
i
put
in
an
additional
order
for
six
more
if
youre
on
the
fence
about
this
one
i
suggest
that
you
hop
on
it
before
its
gone
one
thing
that
i
loved
about
this
beer
is
the
tamed
level
of
sourness
other
offerings
that
i
have
had
from
cascade
have
an
extremely
aggressive
sour
bite
that
overwhelms
other
aspects
of
the
beer
that
is
not
the
case
at
all
with
this
one
extremely
well
balanced
extremely
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
stays
true
to
blueberries
i
only
wish
it
was
even
more
dense
in
berry
flavor
not
body
still
bound
to
delight
any
berrylover
o
its
sour
its
made
with
blueberries
its
delicious
overall
excellent
brew
this
thing
stared
me
down
until
i
opened
one
and
i
am
very
glad
i
broke
down
definitely
going
to
order
a
few
more
o
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
acidity
levels
arent
over
the
top
just
enough
to
make
it
clean
and
refreshing
fruit
comes
through
nicely
as
well
this
ranks
up
among
my
favorites
from
cascade
overall
i
am
quite
pleased
to
hear
this
will
be
released
in
bottles
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
o
good
light
body
with
nice
carbonation
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
more
like
a
juice
drink
than
a
wild
ale
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
awesome
beer
not
quite
as
sour
as
some
of
cascades
other
offerings
but
if
you
like
their
stuff
and
blueberry
based
beers
this
is
a
must
try
smells
exactly
like
blueberry
pie
with
light
sourness
to
it
looking
forward
to
getting
a
bottle
of
this
in
the
future
on
tap
at
city
beer
store
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
small
white
head
that
settles
to
ring
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
big
lactic
with
some
blueberry
sweetness
some
light
funkiness
as
well
as
a
light
buttery
note
the
initial
taste
is
big
blueberry
with
some
sweetness
as
well
as
a
sharp
lactic
tartness
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
butterscotch
medium
body
medium
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
and
very
tart
beer
tastes
nice
like
blueberries
with
a
mildly
lactic
creaminess
and
tart
finish
the
fruit
is
great
in
this
beer
a
really
nice
beer
overall
and
sweet
balanced
well
with
the
sour
id
have
this
again
overall
good
beer
looking
forward
to
them
perfecting
it
the
body
is
crisp
with
clean
acidity
and
a
dry
sour
finish
good
carbonation
this
is
an
impressive
beer
and
one
that
i
hope
becomes
a
regular
offering
in
cascades
fruited
sour
rotation
on
tap
at
chucks
85th
market
pours
a
medium
bluepurple
color
with
little
head
smell
is
funky
and
sour
plenty
of
blueberries
taste
is
very
tart
and
dry
plenty
of
juicy
blueberry
packed
in
great
sour
but
can
be
overwhelming
if
you
dont
know
what
youre
getting
in
to
theres
a
great
bouquet
on
this
with
a
slightly
tart
lightly
funky
very
berry
aroma
the
flavor
is
sourly
tart
and
tangy
yet
balanced
with
a
berry
squeeze
full
of
juicy
flavors
this
was
deliciousness
this
review
is
for
batch
1
nc
batch

paled
in
comparison
very
good
sour
tastes
like
blackberries
the
smell
was
a
bit
too
funky
for
my
personal
taste
but
overall
an
impressive
fruited
sour
another
fine
wild
beer
from
jk
blackberries
probably
just
about
as
good
as
you
can
do
them
not
all
that
sour
or
complex
but
still
a
great
flavor
profile
overall
wow
this
is
easily
one
of
the
deepest
most
complex
sours
ive
had
and
i
truly
enjoyed
it
it
definitely
settles
that
sour
craving
but
hidden
behind
that
is
a
huge
earthy
oak
that
i
love
i
particularly
loved
how
the
blackberries
dont
just
add
a
fruited
note
to
this
sour
to
make
it
accessible
by
sweetening
it
up
but
instead
blend
and
add
to
that
earthy
oak
that
is
so
damn
good
serving
type

overall
sad
panda

is
a

with

is

of
oak
and
a
very
fleshy
blackberry
a
bit
seedy
and
pitted
taste
is
similar
the
blackberry
is
seedy
the
brett
is
very
strong
a
little
too
strong
as
it
drowns
out
the
blackberry
very
faint
in
flavor
strong

on

jester

brings
another
dry
and

are
very
successful
there

the

cherries
musty
basement
funk
cherries
raspberries
mild
acetic
character
soft

and
a
delicate

this
and
atrial
rubicite
seem
inspired
by
cantillon
which
is
certainly
a
good
thing
a
cherry
showcase
and
a
fine
example
of
an
american
wild
ale
o
a
very
nice
fruited
sour
that
quenches
thirst
and
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
some
slight
flaws
that
can
be
fixed
but
still
very
good
o
nose
is
crazy
flavor
is
solid
but
bit
flat
and
one
dimensonal
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
almost
close
to
wine
blackberry
is
such
a
hard
fruit
to
show
through
authentically
in
a
beer
especially
in
a
long
brett
fermented
one
where
all
the
flavorful
sugars
just
get
broken
down
to
oblivion
this
is
a
wonderful
demonstration
that
it
is
indeed
possible
inky
purple
hazy
and
wheaty
from
the
looks
of
it
this
is
what
i
wanted
my
homebrewed
blackberry
saison
to
look
like
this
color
is
try
blackberry
beauty
a
nose
of
brett
more
than
lacto
although
both
are
present
as
they
always
are
in
jester
king
stuff
the
fruit
is
musty
and
yeasty
minimally
processed
yet
still
fresh
as
anything
and
juicy
and
sweet
and
ripe
and
sunny
and
perfect
the
berry
flavor
is
right
up
front
with
a
touch
of
really
pale
wheat
and
slightly
sweeter
more
voluptuous
biscuit
malt
type
while
the
funk
comes
second
bretty
before
acidic
again
just
like
the
aroma
and
then
the
berry
blasts
back
in
the
finish
tartness
on
tartness
just
how
these
should
be
i
dont
think
the
fruit
shows
as
well
as
the
wine
grape
one
the
rubicite
or
even
the
cherry
one
but
its
blackberries
and
thats
part
of
their
modus
great
beer
stunning
really
worthy
of
all
they
hype
and
then
some
cost

a
500

very
nice
looking
a
gently
foam
around
the
edge
with
some
light

purple

on

smell
is
very
fruity
and
a
little
wine
like
some
funk
and
barrel
in
the
nose
too
starts
out
with
a
tart
burst
of
not
quite
ripe
blackberries
pick
up
some
nice
funk
on
the
very
end
with
barrel
notes
appearing
as
well
the
fruit
is
nicely
balanced
here
with
everything
else

vsb
was
super

just
a

with
a

that
recedes
somewhat

beautiful
notes
of

and
blackberries
big

wow
really
nice
flavor
is
juicy
black

up

dries
out
quickly
with
lots
of
dry
oakiness
light
vanilla
lacto
and
big
sour
vinegar
notes
acidic
on
the
tongue
and
that
lingers
with
the
dry
oak
lots
of
oak
tannins
and
red
wine
notes
both
in
aroma
and
flavor
medium
bodied
juicy
at
first
with
the
dry
finished
and
high
carbonation
this
is
crazy
good
and
even
improves
as
it
warms
and
the
berries
really
start
coming
through
o
overall
definitely
enjoy
ar
and
mvb
better
but
this
was
refreshing
and
definitely
enjoyed
every
drop
overall
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
consider
a
mellow
version
of
vsb
jester
king
is
the
real
deal
and
this
sour
is
seriously
under
rated
but
vsb
is
still
better
sour
beer
with
blackberries
pours
a
clear
dark
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
with
malt
berry
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
malt
berry
and
acidic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
quite
sour
recommended
this
here
is
better
than
atrial
if
vsb
is
better
than
this
then
its
probably
a
religious
experience
do
i
think
it
could
be
better
probably
not
but
then
im
a
fan
of
restrained
sours
whereas
others
like
them
mouth
puckering
i
can
think
of
10
fruit
sours
that
are
fruitier
than
this
but
only
in
the
fruit
sweetness
sense
this
is
raw
fruit
vinous
dry
funky
oaky
and
plain
delicious
and
the
best
thing
of
all
it
seems
like
this
will
only
age
and
transform
graciously
i
dont
think
im
trading
mine
definitely
hoarding
this
one
o
this
would
be
my
favorite
jk
sour
that
ive
had
and
in
my
top
3
sours
so
far
overall
a
huge
improvement
over
the
last
iteration
of
this
beer
the
last
one
was
rather
vinegary
and
somewhat
light
on
actual
blackberry
flavor
this
was
more
like
blackberry
cobbler
i
think
by
this
point
its
pretty
clear
im
a
jester
king
fanboy
o
this
was
a
very
nice
fruited
awa
however
its
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
i
was
hoping
it
was
definitely
very
enjoyable
but
has
a
hard
time
standing
up
against
other
jk
sours
such
as
atrial
and
aurelian
that
being
said
this
is
a
great
beer
that
any
fruited
sour
fan
needs
to
try
overall
its
too
sour
for
me
most
of
the
other
flavors
are
masked
but
what
i
do
taste
is
good
this
gorgeous
looking
brew
is
one
of
the
better
fruited
dry
sour
ales
by
jester
king
among
nocturn
atrial
and
aurelian
my
favorite
is
atrial
followed
by
this
then
aurelian
is
a
distant
third
this
brew
has
a
much
better
feel
than
aurelian
at
the
same
time
the
flavor
lacks
some
complexity
i
would
like
to
taste
more
oak
and
berry
notes
the
tart
flavor
is
outstanding

which
is
no

considering

quite

that
retained

overall
another
good
beer
from
jk
but
not
my
favorite
reminds
me
of
chardoneighbor
of
the
beast
very
nice
sour
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
beer
and
really
has
little
head
smell
is
very
subdued
and
yes
you
can
tell
it
has
those
funky
agents
in
it
taste
is
great
not
overly
sour
but
sour
enough
has
a
bit
of
dryness
toward
the
end
lots
of
fruits
involved
light
beer
also
a
very
oaky
wild
ale
heavy
on
the
vanillin
imho
not
up
to
the
usual
quality
of
jk
cheers
o
an
amazing
beer
from
one
of
the
sickest
breweries
and
friendliest
brewers
in
america
true
fact
this
is
a
refreshing
and
surprisingly
drinkable
brew
for
a
10
2
abv
tag
does
not
seem
like
it
at
all
that
in
itself
is
amazing
but
regardless
if
you
ever
find
yourself
in
a
situation
where
you
can
buy
a
bottle
or
two
or
at
least
sample
any
jk
beer
do
it
nice
copper
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
on
this
brew
is
strong
and
has
a
lot
of
sourness
right
out
of
the
gate
with
a
some
funk
some
oak
and
maybe
some
tart
citrus
rind
grasshay
earthy
the
flavor
kicks
like
a
mule
though
and
is
facemelting
sour
but
in
a
good
way
this
is
a
massively
sour
ale
with
plenty
of
funk
and
on
the
finish
some
more
subtle
notes
of
the
farm
earth
grass
and
hay
a
delicious
beer
but
i
am
glad
i
had
help
with
this
bottle
overall
i
loved
this
beer
if
you
like
sours
youll
love
this
one
the
beer
is
light
copper
with
ample
head
a
bit
of
a
gusher
served
at
cellar
temp
so
maybe
best
to
chill
this
a
bit
prior
to
opening
the
aroma
offers
funk
oak
white
wine
earth
residual
citrus
champagne
and
white
wine
notes
amid
an
earthy
grainy
body
very
nice
a
great
afternoon
sipping
beer
which
is
exactly
what
i
did
dry
finish
with
lingering
funk
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
not
as
outstanding
as
the
oi
oi
in
my
opinion
but
the
interplay
between
the
hops
and
wild
yeast
is
pretty
incredible
the
beer
pours
a
tarnished
copper
that
gushes
thick
foamy
white
head
from
the
bottle
but
settles
into
a
residual
thin
halo
around
the
perimeter
theres
decent
lacing
and
some
flecks
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
buttery
whiskey
and
vinous
oak
presence
upfront
funky
citrus
and
some
booze
dominate
the
nose
however
the
beers
citrusy
tartness
is
amplified
in
the
taste
leaving
a
strange
orange
juicy
concentrate
mix
of
spirit
barrel
caramelvanilla
and
tannin
bitterness
this
beer
is
thick
medium
bodied
with
modest
bitterness
citrusy
sweetness
a
distinct
alcohol
presence
towards
the
finish
and
residual
bittersemisweet
finish
the
beer
definitely
reminds
me
of
bottleworks
14
from
cascade
and
id
say
this
is
safely
in
second
by
comparison
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
definitely
quite
the
acquired
taste
wife
hated
it
you
better
like
sour
and
funky
but
i
dug
it
boxers
revenge
is
a
masterfully
blended
ale
that
doesnt
push
the
barrel
aging
too
far
but
allows
them
to
make
a
meaningful
mark
upon
the
ale
with
nuances
of
both
wine
and
whisky
despite
its
complexity
its
a
highly
palatable
ale
that
is
begging
for
cedar
plank
salmon
and
pecan
pie
unique
brew
here
even
in
the
out
there
context
of
wilds
anyway
this
is
just
different
tons
of
yeast
floaters
snowglobe
style
in
a
hazy
brown
amber
liquid
with
an
inch
of
thick
white
head
and
an
aroma
of
heavy
whiskey
barrels
and
farmy
yeast
fruity
notes
apples
and
pears
give
it
a
sweetness
while
bacterial
sour
notes
dry
it
out
as
far
as
the
flavor
goes
its
complex
as
anything
and
well
built
but
im
not
sure
the
right
barrel
was
chosen
to
compliment
the
beer
itself
i
miss
the
subtle
pucker
and
malt
balance
i
get
a
ton
of
vanilla
and
it
clashes
with
the
sour
a
bit
getting
more
and
more
funky
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
strength
remains
well
hidden
a
real
impressive
feature
of
this
slightly
confused
but
very
intriguing
brew
fuller
bodied
for
a
sour
type
and
not
quite
as
well
carbonated
but
the
feel
works
fine
overall
this
is
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
but
for
16
bucks
a
bottle
its
not
good
enough
for
me
to
justify
another
bottle
a
wonderfully
aromatic
sour
definitely
one
of
the
fruit
forwardwithout
having
actual
fruit
added
that
ive
ever
smelled
unfortunately
most
of
the
fruity
aromatics
are
not
carried
over
in
taste
most
of
the
juicy
tropical
yeast
driven
characteristics
that
are
there
in
taste
initially
are
quickly
overwhelmed
by
barrel
presence
and
hop
character
this
is
a
very
unique
sour
beer
perfect
pairing
with
humboldt
fog
flat
malty
not
very
sour
or
funky
just
kind
of
odd
and
inappropriately
sweet
so
different
from
last
bottle
i
had
o
this
is
delicious
and
wonderful
tart
but
still
retains
that
distinct
jester
king
funk
from
the
yeast
i
could
probably
spend
more
time
trying
to
discern
some
of
the
flavors
but
id
rather
just
enjoy
without
thinking
about
it
too
much
previously
from
tap
this
pours
a
ruddy
rubyamber
color
with
thin
lacing
it
has
an
incredible
aroma
amazingly
tart
and
sour
with
an
incredible
flavor
and
a
funky
dry
finish
i
get
an
assertive
mouthpuckering
tartness
up
front
and
a
sharp
intensity
of
tastes
which
cut
like
a
samurais
blade
no
hint
of
its
abv
even
as
it
warms
fantastic
utterly
delicious
a
pretty
well
rendered
affair
with
so
much
exploratory
brewing
prowess
all
of
which
falls
suitably
in
line
woody
funky
fruity
and
rather
pleasantly
not
boozy
that
mis
amigos
is
the
most
newsworthy
effect
here
amongst
stiff
competition
totally
worthy
of
investigating
ok
drinking
carefully
should
you
get
the
chance
o
i
was
expecting
a
flavour
bomb
given
the
abv
nope
think
subtle
and
complex
and
dry
not
my
first
jester
king
and
i
suspect
wont
be
buying
any
more
due
to
overdry
finish
across
their
range
i
disagree
with
suggested
serving
temp
of
5055
seems
to
be
best
chilled
the
brew
is
aged
in
oak
whiskey
and
wine
barrels
with
multiple
strains
of
wild
yeast
and
bacteria
and
exudes
a
rustic
earthiness
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
the
beer
holds
a
myriad
of
flavors
that
meld
into
a
wonderful
and
unique
experience
you
can
definitely
pick
up
the
whiskey
and
wine
oak
aging
on
top
of
the
funky
sourness
and
earthy
barnyard
qualities
wrapping
all
these
flavors
is
a
hop
blanket
that
weaves
in
and
out
of
all
the
flavors
and
lingers
on
your
palate
this
is
just
an
all
around
fantastic
beer
none
of
the
flavors
overpower
you
the
sour
fruits
and
barnyard
funk
hit
the
right
notes
with
the
hoppy
bitterness
and
oak
keeping
everything
in
tune
surprisingly
smooth
and
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
brew
and
opening
my
palate
to
a
larger

sour

a
very
enjoyable
offering
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
boozy
yet
the
barrel
quakity
is
evident
and
interesting
i
am
typically
distracted
and
find
high
alcohol
in
wild
beers
to
be
clashing
however
it
really
worked
in
this
brew
a
bit
too
sour
for
my
palate
but
i
know
plenty
of
sour
pussies
who
would
love
this
ive
tried
to
score
objectively
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
teku
poured
a
vibrant
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
vey
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
orange
zest
citrus
orange
soda
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
funk
citrus
orange
zest
orange
and
subtle
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
orange
note
i
picked
up
on
in
this
one
was
really
quite
nice
and
made
this
one
quite
easy
to
drink
the
funk
was
definitely
present
throughout
the
glass
which
was
very
well
incorporated
in
all
aspects
this
one
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
definitely
a
well
done
brew
that
i
am
glad
that
i
got
the
chance
to
try
and
would
love
to
do
so
again
this
is
a
strange
beer
the
previous
sentence
loses
some
significance
considering
ive
pretty
much
said
the
same
thing
about
every
single
jester
king
beer
personally
i
think
this
is
somewhere
between
an
american
wild
and
an
american
saison
theres
a
lot
of
wood
white
wine
tart
funk
and
barrel
in
here
definitely
worth
a
checking
out
decent
not
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
jester
king
but
complex
a
bit
muddled
in
terms
of
the
barrel
and
yeast
influence
pretty
tasty
wild
ale
with
a
tartness
that
wasnt
overboard
and
a
funkiness
that
wasnt
too
crazy
either
just
a
nice
blend
of
the
two
thats
sure
to
please
any
fan
of
the
style
i
will
say
the
heaviness
of
the
booze
eventually
started
to
take
a
toll
on
my
palate
this
beer
would
be
difficult
to
drink
in
large
quantities
luckily
i
had
someone
to
split
it
with
but
even
a
12
oz
pour
was
quite
a
bit
good
beer
but
better
in
smaller
quantities
for
sure
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
really
lives
up
to
the
title
of
a
wild
farmhouse
ale
its
just
tart
enough
with
the
great
accents
of
different
yeast
and
different
barrel
flavors
really
tasty
and
seriously
drinkable
for
10

it
does
have
tastes
of
funky
vinegarbretttangerineherbal
earthy

and
finishes
with

and
overall
i
love
it
basically
a

and
ill
be
buying
more
cheers
overall
complex
but
not
in
the
best
way
all
the
time
forgivable
though

of
citrus
tropical

some

flavor

the
nose
fairly
well
some

of
which

wrapped

very
flavorful
alcohol
well
hidden

a

sweet
and
the
sour
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
bright
active
carbonation
keeping
it
interesting
overall
a
satisfying
unique
wild
beer
t
opens
with
a
slightly
sour
sweet
white
wine
flavor
some
fairly
complex
malt
and
wood
flavors
with
a
dash
of
brett
faint
hints
of
citrus
tropical
fruit
and
barrel
a
nice
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
wood
and
more
funk
a
really
interesting
beer
dry
but
sweet
tart
but
smooth
big
in
alcohol
but
light
on
the
mouthfeel
really
good
stuff
ahhh
ive
been
waiting
for
a
beer
this
sour
from
lk
for
quite
some
time
its
fairly
puckering
not
as
clean
of
sour
flavor
as
a
cantillon
but
still
drinks
quite
nice
a
little
bit
of
woody
character
comes
out
from
the
time
spent
in
barrels
i
get
more
wine
barrel
than
whiskey
along
with
a
hint
of
brett
mouthfeel
definitely
could
use
some
more
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
now
but
i
am
excited
to
see
how
it
progresses
as
jk
gets
better
at
blending
im
amazed
a
beer
this
light
in
malt
and
body
can
cover
such
a
high
alcohol
with
ease
o
yet
again
jester
king
has
made
a
big
likeable
beer
drinkable
cloudy
yellow
with
a
thin
small
white
foam
layer
jk
nailed
the
color
on
the
nose
a
light
lemon
tartness
grass
and
hay
downplayed
sour
lightly
sweet
citrus
flavors
lemon
tart
sweetness
similar
to
a
lemon
square
desert
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
jks
has
accomplished
what
i
have
been
waiting
for
from
a
texas
brewery
or
any
brewery
for
that
matter
someone
who
can
regularly
put
an
excellent
soursaison
on
a
texas
shelf
d
great
sour
beer
fantastic
overall
complexity
and
balance
o
im
really
excited
to
see
this
brewery
available
to
me
in
such
variety
i
have
had
several
of
their
beers
and
they
are
all
very
good
and
distinct
in
their
take
on
standard
styles
this
was
no
exception
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
part
of
my
problem
was
that
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
sour
since
in
my
mind
all
wild
ales
are
and
that
just
simply
isnt
true
the
wild
yeast
they
use
is
very
distinctive
and
very
nice
o
my
first
beer
from
jester
king
and
needless
to
say
i
am
impressed
so
complex
yet
so
drinkable
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
sour
kick
but
im
just
nit
picking
this
beer
is
awesome
highly
recommend
ooverall
an
excellent
beer
this
would
be
one
of
my
favorites
if
they
bumped
up
the
carbonation
a
bit
love
the
blend
of
sour
funk
and
sweetness
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
malt
wine
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
nice
acidic
quality
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
pretty
damn
good
i
would
say
has
a
decent
about
of
alcohol
so
you
will
feel
good
after
knocking
back
a
bottle
a
good
sour
taste
but
its
not
overly
sour
would
seek
out
again
if
it
was
easily
found
in
houston
would
like
to
see
if
aging
has
any
changes
in
flavor
thanks
mhenson42
for
the
opportunity
overall
an
interesting
higher
abv
wild
with
some
good
sour
citrus
going
on
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
at
this
abv
feeling
pretty
fine
already
digin
it
750
ml
bottle
hazy
peached
colored
with
residual
white
head
its
smell
is
more
bit
of
light
citrus
and
some
funk
sourness
is
definitely
there
with
funky
and
citrus
hops
i
can
sense
that
there
is
some
of
brett
into
this
really
great
sour
beer
i
definitely
look
forward
to
its
next
release
next
year
have
yet
to
really
be
impressed
by
a
jester
king
beer
this
one
is
so
close
id
love
to
try
a
version
that
leaves
out
the
whiskey
barrels
i
feel
the
base
flavor
profile
and
the
wine
barrels
create
a
delicious
combo
but
the
whiskey
butts
in
at
the
end
and
completely
clashes
leaving
an
muddied
aftertaste
and
overall
lowering
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
o
again
another
great
beer
from
jester
king
this
is
a
must
buy
when
you
see
it
i
would
have
liked
it
to
have
a
bit
more
depth
to
it
maybe
a
little
more
sweetness
but
it
was
still
excellent
drink
this
was
a
good
beer
it
was
unique
well
crafted
and
very
flavorful
i
enjoyed
the
duality
of
the
treatments
but
i
think
the
abv
and
body
needed
to
come
down
a
couple
touches
i
would
say
this
might
get
better
and
i
might
wanna
go
find
a
couple
more
bottles
o
a
very
good
sour
ale
not
too
heavy
given
the
abv
and
perfect
for
the
aperitif
for
instance
i
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
d
very
drinkable
for
a
sour
goes
down
easily
and
hides
its
10
abv
easily
o
tart
and
funky
not
much
carbonation
but
still
nice
overall
this
was
a
really
interesting
sour
lots
of
complexity
i
really
enjoyed
the
wine
notes
very
much
i
dont
think
the
whiskey
added
much
here
i
would
definitely
have
another
bottle
of
this
one
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
theres
so
many
better
sours
out
there
o
good
sour
not
too
complex
but
no
complaints
either
o
sampled
boxers
at
the
brewery
was
happy
to
pick
up
a
bottle
i
like
the
elevated
hop
presence
compared
to
other
sours
ive
had
glad
to
have
access
to
a
quality
local
sour
m
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
but
not
overly
overall
quite
nice
a
very
nice
american
made
sour
with
great
tartness
sour
fruit
flavors
good
acidity
and
tannins
and
lots
of
buttery
vanilla
oak
to
round
it
all
off
and
a
big
abv
that
is
hidden
well
as
lots
of
booze
is
hard
to
go
with
sours
o
probably
my
favorite
jester
king
offering
so
far
would
love
to
see
their
dream
of
this
becoming
a
year
round
on
texas
shelves
become
a
reality
o
good
overall
one
of
my
favorite
jester
king
beers
o
as
far
as
i
recall
i
had
three
of
these
at
the
draught
house
and
i
cant
even
remember
if
it
was
served
in
pints
or
tulips
or
jester
king
goblets
all
i
know
is
it
was
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
tasted
in
a
long
time
and
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
it
good
job
i
was
going
home
on
the
bus
that
night
and
didnt
have
to
go
to
work
next
morning
the
pour
is
a
light
straw
color
with
a
white
head
very
lactic
aroma
with
tons
of
lemon
and
lemon
zest
a
bit
of
straw
lightly
tropical
and
maybe
some
other
citrus
notes
very
mild
oak
high
acidity
on
the
palate
with
lots
of
tart
lemon
and
green
apple
flavors
hints
of
tropical
fruit
and
oak
minimal
funk
and
straw
overall
simply
puti
really
dig
this
beer
the
flavor
starts
off
tart
and
simple
but
becomes
more
complex
through
the
middle
wrapped
up
again
in
simplicity
by
the
end
another
very
solid
offering
from
jk
o
very
interesting
beer
strong
flavoring
mainly
dominated
by
the
sourness
will
definitely
try
again
o
another
great
offering
from
jester
king
boxers
revenge
is
a
wild
alesour
that
delivers
a
ton
of
flavor
without
being
too
sour
and
leaving
an
unpleasant
taste
in
the
mouth
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
beer
ages
o
very
interesting
and
unique
dont
get
much
whiskey
character
but
overall
this
is
delicious
and
worth
a
try
i
like
it
never
had
a
beer
from
this
brewery
before
and
id
definitely
be
open
to
try
more
this
particular
beer
i
wouldnt
go
through
too
much
effort
to
seek
out
but
its
an
enjoyable
quaff
cant
wait
for
the
second
batch
of
this
to
come
out
an
improved
level
of
carbonation
could
give
this
beer
quite
the
face
lift
it
needs
it
has
a
great
flavor
profile
working
for
it
as
is
o
my
favorite
wild
ale
to
date
due
to
its
high
level
of
drinkability
and
surprisingly
complex
flavor
i
want
more
o
easy
drinking
for
9
nice
amount
of
sour
notes
and
a
nice
dry
finish
enjoyed
this
one
for
sure
and
would
buy
another
bottle
if
i
have
the
chance
the
rare
find
as
most
american
sours
seem
to
be
whiskey
and
wine
barrel
aged
sour
with
a
wonderful
nose
and
a
sour
mash
whiskey
quality
to
it
nose
is
sauvignon
blanc
funk
and
hint
of
melon
and
horseblanket
undertones
palate
is
actually
much
more
sour
than
expected
quite
bright
but
balanced
very
dry
with
that
sour
whiskey
mash
note
and
hints
of
whiskey
noted
coconut
nice
buttering
that
comes
forth
grassy
wonderful
one
to
share
poured
from
bottle
into
jk
farmhouse
glass
when
opened
barely
even
a
hiss
notably
lacking
carbonation
with
a
little
bit
of
a
rough
pour
some
head
rises
off
the
top
of
the
beer
but
it
goes
away
quickly
this
beer
is
indeed
flatish
other
than
that
a
nice
orangeyellow
color
with
some
cloudiness
smell
tart
and
sweet
nice
vinous
aroma
from
the
barrel
some
funky
bouquet
as
well
taste
puckering
sour
with
a
salty
dry
finish
tastes
like
sea
salt
meets
sour
patch
candy
no
abv
is
present
at
all
for
9
it
is
well
hidden
with
carbonation
this
would
have
been
way
better
but
still
a
nice
effort
from
jk
albeit
not
my
fav
sour
from
them
das
wunderkind
boxers
revenge
is
a
great
beer
and
a
welcome
addition
to
the
texas
sour
ale
scene
but
like
the
angry
horse
on
its
label
it
hasnt
yet
made
up
its
mind
as
to
the
direction
its
heading
still
im
very
much
excited
to
see
what
path
it
takes
d
good
but
it
is
a
bit
winey
sweet
like
a
very
fruity
white
wine
it
has
an
overall
refined
profile
the
flavor
are
interesting
and
unusual
but
seems
carefully
balanced
the
wild
yeast
is
kept
in
check
not
too
much
earthy
medicinal
funk
i
really
love
this
again
well
done
jester
king
just
an
excellent
saison
i
am
not
sure
if
i
like
this
as
much
as
boulevards
saisons
at
the
moment
but
i
would
hate
to
live
on
the
difference
highly
recommended
d
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
well
done
jester
king
drinkability
is
fairly
good
not
being
a
particular
fan
of
sours
the
tart
qualities
are
mild
and
tolerable
for
me
a
very
nice
saison
i
just
wish
it
was
a
little
bit
funkier
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
think
with
some
more
effort
and
time
it
could
be
great
come
on
jester
king
hit
the
funk
out
of
the
park
i
never
really
enjoyed
this
just
a
mess
trying
it
again
just
confirms
that
it
is
pretty
poorly
made
no
definition
and
probably
not
something
i
am
coming
back
to
again
any
time
soon
drinkable
but
not
truly
memorable
the
flavors
never
quite
meld
and
the
sour
nature
becomes
too
acetic
as
it
warms
maybe
a
bit
more
time
or
a
more
nuanced
blend
sour
stouts
are
very
hit
or
miss
this
has
a
huge
amount
of
what
generally
makes
jester
king
beers
great
like
their
intense
funk
and
yeasty
flavors
overall
they
somewhat
clash
with
the
burnt
malt
profile
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
this
may
be
worth
seeking
out
o
the
surprise
of
the
day
i
was
not
expecting
to
have
a
sour
funky
stout
this
good
great
job
jester
king
this
one
really
took
me
by
surprise
expecting
an
enormous
oak
heavy
full
bodied
wild
stout
akin
to
something
like
tart
of
darkness
i
was
totally
wrong
its
so
light
in
body
not
bitter
at
all
from
the
roast
minimal
viscosity
and
really
pretty
clean
finishing
borderline
refreshing
for
what
it
is
and
totally
different
than
other
wild
stouts
might
even
be
a
stretch
to
call
it
that
dark
in
color
with
an
average
head
i
am
taken
aback
by
its
runny
texture
not
rich
or
syrupy
at
all
the
nose
shows
lemony
lacto
pretty
intensely
but
also
notes
of
brett
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
barrel
has
influenced
this
quite
a
bit
lemony
citrus
all
through
the
taste
and
less
roasted
character
than
i
am
used
to
in
a
stout
more
of
a
dry
cocoa
thing
not
quite
as
bitter
but
definitely
dark
i
may
have
enjoyed
black
metal
more
the
bourbon
barrel
while
adding
a
ton
of
flavor
i
dont
think
all
the
way
jives
with
the
sourness
the
sweet
vanilla
seems
to
be
fighting
the
bacteria
cultures
and
never
really
resolves
itself
complicated
set
of
flavors
on
this
one
and
i
like
it
a
lot
very
different
from
anything
else
out
there
more
carbonation
would
be
helpful
but
maybe
then
it
would
even
be
too
light
curious
to
see
how
this
one
evolves
in
the
cellar
over
time
o
a
beer
that
is
super
unique
definitely
recommended
served
in
jester
king

thanks
michael
the

body
is
quite
full
for
style
with
good
carbonation
and
no

pretty
enjoyable
even
though
soured
stout
are
not
something
i
look
for
on
a
regular
basis
o
exactly
what
you
would
think
and
like
nothing
else
out
there
overall
a
great
sour
stout
interesting
and
complex
really
loving
this
beer
all
the
awesomeness
o
a
sour
with
lots
of
chocolate
and
dark
roast
o
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
had
amazing
balance
between
stout
and
sour
very
smooth
texture
tart
and
roasty
tons
of
complex

this
is
a
little

really
quite
impressed
with
this
one
a
beautiful
marriage
between
two
seemingly
polar
opposites
would
have
again
for
sure
i
really
enjoyed
this
incredibly
complex
and
tangy
stout
the
amount
of
control
that
must
have
been
needed
to
brew
this
beer
letting
the
tangy
and
slightly
lacto
flavors
out
but
not
overpowering
the
chocolatey
roasty
stout
notes
this
beer
is
more
art
and
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
low
b
o
this
is
a
very
intense
sour
stout
it
has
all
of
the
hallmarks
of
a
big
sour
but
without
any
vinous
notes
or
fruitiness
that
usually
goes
with
it
for
balance
the
stout
notes
are
dry
and
bitter
and
make
this
a
onenote
beer
thankfully
that
one
bittersour
note
is
very
well
done
black
beer
with
a
thin

typical
charred
roasty

flavors
arent
as
strong
as
in
most
stouts
i
get
more
tobacco
and
leather
with
cocoa
powder
than
anything
in
terms
of
the
malts
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
body
with
prickly
tiny

if
ever
there
was
an
8

stout
made
for
drinking
outside
on
a
hot
hill
country
day
this
is
it
tart
and
tart
and
sweet
in
all
the
right
places
makes
for
nice
unique
drinking
had
this
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
time
to
crack
it
as
i
love
the

and

it

its
amazing
how
much
brett

can
change
and
overtake
a
brew
but
luckily
enough
i
love

and
reminds
me
of
some
flemish
red

brown

yeah
like

a

not

kind
of
like
the
purple
sweet
tart
cheers
overall
very
nice
stuff
for
some
reason
a
sour
stout
never
sounds
appealing
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
great
flavours
that
work
well
together
mouthfeel
remains
sour
throughout
you
can
start
to
think
they
flash
burned
the
barrel
the
smallest
smoke
contingent
gets
in
there
if
i
had
a
bunch
of
these
this
would
be
a
good
sour
to
take
camping
im
thinking
o
this
was
certainly
different
loads
of
sour
cherries
and
lactic
acid
dumped
on
top
of
an
innocent
stout
the
barrel
aging
is
subtle
but
the
bacteria
really
steals
the
show
here
i
feel
a
charred
heartburn
coming
on
but
it
was
damn
worth
it
overall
great
beer
overall
decent
for
a
sour
stout
not
a
great
deal
can
be
done
with
a
sour
stout
i
think
i
cant
do
this
brew
justice
with
just
my
meager
description
i
wasnt
really
a
sour
beer
lover
until
i
visited
jester
king
but
they
have
won
me
over
somehow
they
have
managed
to
bring
together
two
completely
different
types
of
beer
and
have
done
it
superbly
well
the
price
and
availability
i
was
even
told
by
employees
they
arent
making
this
brew
anymore
keeps
this
from
being
something
i
can
try
regularly
but
if
you
see
this
on
the
shelves
get
as
many
bottles
as
you
can
o
this
beer
is
fantastically
different
from
anything
that
ive
ever
had
before
it
has
elements
of
a
good
stout
but
also
has
great
sour
aromas
and
flavors
i
never
would
have
thought
that
a
sour
stout
would
be
good
but
jester
king
has
proven
me
very
very
wrong
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
one
that
im
extremely
glad
that
i
got
to
try
shared
with
my
doppelganger
on
his
wedding
day
prior
to
getting
ready
for
the
festivities
served
from
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
globe
poured
black
with
a
one
finger
brown
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
compromised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
fruit
earth
sour
funk
and
wood
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
sour
tart
funk
roasted
malt
and
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
tart
and
sour
twist
on
this
one
was
actually
quite
nice
on
the
base
brew
this
made
it
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
throughout
the
glass
wish
this
were
readily
available
in
my
area
so
i
could
crush
this
daily
definitely
worth
your
time
o
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
with
nice
cross
platform
aspects
solid
and
drinkable
glad
i
shared
it
m
thick
rich
and
drinkable
overall
id
say
this
beer
is
for
the
adventurous
and
the
enthusiastic
intimidating
unique
and
memorable
overall
its
an
odd
rarely
seen
type
of
brew
even
in
the
vast
world
of
craft
beer
but
this
is
just
insanely
refreshing
and
light
dangerously
drinkable
for
an
8
2
abv
i
paired
this
with
a
lemon
bundt
cake
with
icing
and
the
duo
is
an
absolute
dynamic
overall
well
im
impressed
ive
got
mixed
feelings
about
jk
and
some
of
their
more
experimental
offerings
such
as
the
oneoff
mashups
they
offer
on
tour
days
are
just
a
hot
mess
this
however
is
spoton
none
of
the
sometimes
observed
what
i
would
consider
undesirable
wild
characteristics
dirty
feet
horse
sweat
asparagus
etc
are
evident
the
slightly
sweet
and
wellrounded
stout
flavors
blend
perfectly
with
the
notquite
puckery
sourness
and
produce
something
both
unique
and
delicious
bravo
id
like
to
see
more
like
this
absolutely
absolutely
worth
trying
highly
recommended
o
i
was
super
curious
to
try
this
because
of
previous
reviews
comparing
it
to
cd4
it
is
similar
in
that
is
a
dark
sour
but
is
also
clearly
different
at
the
same
time
in
that
funk
metal
sticks
true
to
its
stout
by
nature
im
unaware
of
the
blend
of
base
beers
of
cd4
but
i
know
it
wasnt
as
chocolaty
this
defiantly
blows
tart
of
darkness
out
of
the
water
thats
for
sure
id
like
to
try
it
again
in
a
few
months
to
see
how
it
tartens
up
pours
black
and
murky
just
a
sliver
of
dark
brown
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
little
head
just
a
thin
film
of
brown
bubbles
of
various
sizes
and
even
that
disappeared
fairly
quickly
ive
seen
pictures
of
this
beer
with
a
lot
more
head
so
i
assume
that
my
bottle
is
just
a
bit
low
on
carbonation
i
really
dont
care
about
appearance
nor
expect
perfect
consistency
from
sours
so
it
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
the
aroma
has
lots
of
fruit
and
some
underlying
stout
character
im
getting
a
lot
of
blackberries
and
red
wine
theres
a
good
dose
of
oak
in
there
underneath
that
fruity
sourness
theres
chocolate
a
little
caramel
and
mild
roast
very
pleasant
mix
of
chocolate
and
fruit
the
flavors
are
well
composed
and
seem
much
more
intentional
than
probably
any
other
sour
stout
that
ive
tried
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
primary
flavors
are
chocolate
sour
tannic
oak
blackberries
and
red
wine
fairly
tart
particularly
in
the
finish
some
cocoa
sweetness
but
the
oak
provides
a
drying
tannic
bite
nice
lingering
red
wine
and
chocolate
aftertaste
carbonation
is
relatively
low
but
that
might
just
be
my
bottle
in
part
very
good
sour
stout
probably
the
best
ive
had
i
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
many
sour
stouts
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
jester
king
continues
to
impress
o
jester
king
calls
this
a
sour
barrel
aged
stout
if
that
is
really
the
case
this
would
be
the
weirdest
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
certainly
agree
with
beeradvocate
this
fits
more
of
the
american
wild
ale
style
regardless
excellent
sour
love
the
brettanomyces
tart
level
is
610
roast
level
blends
in
really
well
at
16
99
its
a
tough
beer
to
highly
recommend
but
the
monetary
value
eliminated
it
is
certainly
very
good
and
very
unique
othis
one
of
the
most
interesting
beer
i
have
ever
tried
it
is
a
sour
upfront
with
a
stout
finish
the
transition
is
clean
and
works
well
i
am
really
surprised
but
it
is
a
mash
of
my
two
favorite
styles
my
first
jk
beer
and
i
will
be
back
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
but
this
is
100
worth
a
try
just
for
the
experience
wow
this
is
extremely
complex
flavorful
sour
and
easy
to
drink
has
more
sour
characteristics
than
stout
characteristics
but
thats
ok
because
it
was
very
well
crafted
d
great
sour
stout
great
overall
balance
and
mouthfeel
overall
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
melange
no
1
flavor
profile
albeit
much
lighter
and
more
drinkable
the
savory
roasty
flavors
throw
off
the
flavors
for
me
a
little
i
like
but
i
dont
love
it
overall
very
well
done
beer
body
is
what
makes
this
a
nice
stout
but
qualities
otherwise
make
this
more
of
a
black
saison
id
say
this
and
cd4
are
nearly
interchangeable
albeit
for
the
mouthfeel
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
dark
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
wood
and
bourbon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
only
a
mild
sourness
and
more
emphasis
on
the
stout
flavors
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
and
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
but
the
flavors
dont
match
up
in
my
opinion
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
layer
of
creamy
off
white
head
lots
of
sour
notes
in
the
smell
but
there
is
a
strong
chocolate
component
as
well
just
a
touch
of
vinegar
the
taste
is
quite
sour
but
not
at
all
abrasive
lots
of
sour
vinegar
notes
but
not
particularly
funky
the
finish
is
tart
with
a
mild
smoke
notes
everything
works
well
together
in
this
beer
o
tart
and
dark
cherry
strong
wood
lingers
for
a
bit
served
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
color
is
an
opaque
black
brown
aroma
is
tart
roast
fruit
flavors
largely
tart
with
only
a
bare
suggestion
of
stout
body
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
and
again
little
like
a
stout
finish
is
like
flavor
on
the
short
side
and
im
not
so
much
a
fan
this
is
a
unique
brew
ill
have
another
overall
jester
king
created
a
flagship
standard
for
sour
stouts
every
aspect
of
the
brew
is
exemplary
funk
metal
will
provide
enjoyment
to
those
that
have
appreciation
for
sours
and
stouts

d
i
will
have
no
problem
putting
down
this
750ml
by
my
self
in
not
a
whole
lot
of
time
actually
im
going
to
have
to
pace
myself
to
enjoy
it
because
i
could
only
find
3
bottles
of
this
and
the
other
two
are
going
to
age
for
a
while
before
i
dig
into
it
again
fine
job
jester
king
fine
job
indeed
i
noticed
after
this
beer
had
been
out
for
a
while
and
warmed
up
the
bitterness
totally
dropped
off
and
it
was
much
more
like
the
first
time
i
had
it
much
more
smooth
and
tart
very
nice
the
next
bottle
i
drink
ill
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
overall
this
was
odd
and
very
delicious
will
definitely
buy
again
if
i
can
find
it
o
excellent
think
chocolate
covered
cherries
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
is
nice
to
see
someone
souring
a
beer
other
than
a
belgian
gold
the
beer
itself
is
black
a
definite
stout
i
got
an
instant
sour
berry
smell
followed
by
some
oak
and
slight
chocolate
very
pleasing
taste
is
very
tart
yet
a
good
malt
and
coffee
finish
which
is
very
well
balanced
and
very
very
good
this
is
surprisingly
well
balanced
for
such
a
mixture
of
styles
i
had
never
had
a
sour
imperial
stout
before
but
i
cant
imagine
it
being
done
better
with
very
few
sour
stouts
to
reflect
upon
funk
metal
gives
me
whats
best
about
oude
bruins
but
elebated
the
bruin
part
to
moderate
roast
and
keeping
the
oude
part
maturely
sour
and
earthen
throughout
this
is
simply
a
masterpiece
of
a
beer
ive
had
most
jk
offerings
and
this
here
is
a
homerun
like
eli
they
did
it
o
very
interesting
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
if
you
love
sour
beers
this
one
will
not
disappoint
o
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
sours
but
this
is
one
sour
i
can
get
on
board
with
the
balance
between
sweet
and
roasted
with
sour
is
superbly
executed
so
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
my
new
favorite
jester
king
beer
the
flavor
is
first
and
foremost
a
barrelaged
wild
ale
and
almost
a
belgian
dark
ale
second
a
nice
biting
acidity
greets
the
tongue
but
is
more
funky
than
sour
barrels
dark
fruit
roast
and
vinegar
ride
the
back
of
the
palate
with
ease
such
a
great
blend
body
is
light
and
effervescent
some
lingering
barrel
wood
and
dryness
on
the
back
of
the
palate
is
all
that
keeps
the
mouthfeel
from
higher
markssomething
i
didnt
notice
on
tap
at
the
funk
sour
fest
looks
like
jester
king
has
found
their
mojo
in
a
big
way
after
some
lackluster
releases
o
this
my
favorite
beer
created
by
jester
king
the
flavor
is
just
like
nothing
else
that
i
have
tasted
and
just
almost
imposible
to
describe
how
delicious
this
is
i
am
glad
that
i
have
bought
a
few
bottles
cant
wait
to
see
what
it
does
with
some
age
on
it
o
this
will
be
a
big
pleaser
for
all
those
jk
sour
seekers
definitely
not
a
gateway
brew
into
the
master
craft
that
is
jester
king
but
a
very
talented
brew
nonetheless
just
like
when
an
epic
band
releases
a
new
album
this
is
one
of
those
pieces
that
needs
to
be
revisited
and
revisited
and
revisited
to
appreciate
every
aspect
of
this
beer
on
my
initial
taste
i
have
to
say
well
done
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
tan
head
exactly
as
expected
however
this
is
where
things
take
a
detour
from
the
traditional
the
aroma
is
extremely
funky
with
some
very
tart
fruit
notes
and
some
oak
roasted
malt
and
a
little
chocolate
the
flavor
is
similar
with
a
lot
of
tartness
and
some
vinegar
notes
complimented
by
the
expected
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
heavily
roasted
malts
surprisingly
all
of
this
works
together
fairly
well
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
a
very
nice
entry
level
sour
anything
from
jester
king
is
amazing
thanks
sj3324
for
the
opportunity
o
not
my
fav
style
and
not
the
best
of
style
i
tend
to
go
toward
the
sweeter
flanders
reds
like
jacobins
but
this
was
pretty
good
ru55
is
underrated
in
my
opinion
very
complex
flavor
profile
brought
on
from
the
oak
barrels
and
bacteriayeast
this
actually
tastes
a
bit
different
than
the
typical
jester
king
offering
its
woody
and
funky
but
it
has
a
really
unique
sour
component
its
somewhere
between
an
american
wild
and
a
flanders
red
and
it
works
its
nicely
sour
nicely
tart
and
definitely
worth
a
try
man
i
continue
to
be
so
disappointed
with
most
of
jester
kings
releases
they
make
styles
that
i
love
but
are
hardly
ever
worth
the
price
tag
or
even
close
to
the
better
examples
of
the
style
this
however
hits
the
mark
nice
character
and
depth
of
flavor
with
a
crisp
drying
fuller
body
which
almost
always
seems
to
be
missing
in
some
of
their
other
beers
this
is
expensive
but
very
enjoyable
and
well
done
a
sour
red
that
is
decidedly
not
a
flemish
style
way
less
lactic
acidity
here
far
more
delicate
all
around
really
but
still
a
nice
copper
malt
driven
sour
with
more
funk
than
tartness
to
it
bronze
in
color
rather
clear
looking
from
the
tap
with
a
short
half
inch
or
so
of
tan
bubbles
the
nose
is
a
lot
like
some
other
jester
king
beers
with
their
mix
of
bacteria
it
has
some
mouth
watering
sourness
but
also
an
almost
saison
style
yeast
element
with
the
caramel
malt
and
crystal
malt
providing
the
base
which
is
medium
bodied
and
still
a
little
sweet
despite
all
the
activity
i
get
a
ton
of
oak
on
the
flavor
woody
and
almost
tealike
a
very
mature
beer
based
on
these
flavors
the
funkiness
increases
in
the
finish
and
the
swallow
is
dry
but
it
all
comes
rushing
back
great
mouthfeel
results
especially
with
the
carbonation
as
robust
as
it
is
a
very
well
made
beer
less
interesting
than
some
of
the
other
jester
king
stuff
but
appreciably
different
from
the
flanders
type
reds
out
there
the
beer
is
dark
amber
with
some
crimson
highlights
the
aroma
brings
a
bouquet
of
funk
oak
sour
cherries
yeast
beautiful
flavor
simply
delicious
lots
of
funk
and
cherry
flavor
with
a
lovely
sour
puckering
finish
medium
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
flanders
red
characteristics
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
overall
clean
fresh
fruity
sour
with
some
light
funk
to
play
along
but
still
meaty
enough
to
stay

i
also
appreciated
the
fact
that
the

reasonable

high
b
by

the
most
clean

forward
take
on

that
i
have
tasted
jester

have
really
took
their

avoiding
the
unpleasant
vinegaresque

that
a

have

everything
you
want
in

red
but
only
hits
them
lightly
overall
refreshing
and
tasty
another
fine
brew
from
jester

o
a
slight

and
pretty
earthy
and
dirty
not
much
fruit
presence
overall
quite
nice
very
tasty
o
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
with
awesome
fruit
notes
just
delicious
again
i
am
more
than
pleasantly
surprised
by
a
jester
king
offering
i
dont
know
if
i
like
this
one
as
much
as
das
wunderkind
but
it
might
not
be
a
fair
comparison
since
they
are
slightly
different
styles
either
way
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
and
it
has
only
reaffirmed
by
faith
in
this
smalltime
texas
brewery
i
pulled
some
similarities
to
rr
consecration
out
of
ru55
when
youre
getting
compared
to
russian
river
sours
you
know
you
must
be
on
the
right
track
poure
out
as
a
reddish
brown
color
the
head
comes
and
goes
quickly
the
retention
is
very
minimal
along
with
a
light
lacing
the
smell
is
a
malty
with
an
interesting
sweetness
also
caramel
or
cherry
on
the
nose
and
lightly
toasted
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
really
interesting
flavor
as
well
more
malty
and
dry
than
sour
there
is
an
earthy
grain
flavor
in
the
finish
with
the
sourness
up
front
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
dry
lightly
carbonated
overall
its
a
pretty
good
brew
o
i
think
this
beer
is
awesome
i
first
had
it
at
brewvivial
2013
in
charleston
and
i
was
hooked
i
needed
to
have
some
more
i
finally
found
a
bottle
and
got
a
chance
to
fully
savor
the
experience
of
course
it
may
not
be
as
complex
or
layered
or
mouthpuckering
as
some
worldclass
belgian
examples
but
it
comes
pretty
close
its
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
given
the
acidity
and
abv
great
beer
from
jester
king
pours
brown
with
a
bone
white
single

head
laces
really

smell
and

similar

has
a
lots

oak
some
vegetable
notes
lots
of
funk
some
dark
fruit
taste
is
drinkably
sour
and
extremely
enjoyable
its
just
sweet
enough
to
balance
out
the
tartness
over
all
this
is
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
being
fairly
new
to
the
style
leaves
you

watering

waiting
for
the
next

i

a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
some
fruity
wood
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
much
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
d
good
wild
ale
nice
overall
balance
with
good
complexity
a
wonderful
beer
im
glad
jk
stepped
into
the
flemish
styled
sour
game
and
did
well
with
this
one
it
is
definitely
low
on
the
carbonation
but
not
completely
devoid
of
some
bubbles
the
flavors
are
all
there
though
tart
fruitiness
medium
amount
of
sourness
and
a
nice
wood
presence
its
still
a
damn
good
flanders
style
ale
especially
once
it
gets
to
room
temp
and
the
sourness
is
more
pronounced
if
it
was
under
10
a
bottle
i
would
buy
some
more
carbonation
problems
be
damned
if
they
fix
that
issue
i
would
love
to
grab
a
few
of
these
even
at
the
steep
tag
of
15
m
light
leading
to
medium
overall
this
is
unlike
most
oud
bruinflanders
red
ales
on
the
market
it
lacks
the
huge
vinegar
the
bruery
and
lactic
cascade
flavors
which
makes
this
a
much
more
balanced
drinkable
sourwild
red
ale
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
without
wrecking
my
palate
i
would
personally
prefer
a
little
more
so
i
will
be
waiting
on
the
remainder
of
my
bottle
for
several
months
to
see
where
it
goes
overall
a
very
solid
brew
that
can
stand
up
to
any
other
beer
not
overly
sour
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
would
probably
get
again
not
bad
but
not
a
fav
by
these
guys
served
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
subsides
slow
to
the
bottom
aroma
is
malt
and
tart
flavors
like
nose
and
dry
body
is
ok
carbonation
good
finish
is
like
flavor
of
relatively
short
length
and
forgettable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
great
blend
of
sourwildred
ale
its
complex
and
still
refreshing
for
me
this
one
was
worth
the
higher
price
tag
will
seek
more
the
flavor
is
aggressively
sour
but
balanced
with
enough
amber
malt
presence
that
it
doesnt
strip
away
the
enamel
think
russian
rivers
consecration
without
the
currants
the
finish
is
dry
and
fruity
with
vinegar
black
cherry
leather
and
woodiness
from
the
barrelaging
mouthfeel
is
juicy
where
it
should
be
up
until
the
drying
finish
and
light
in
carbonation
and
thickness
all
in
all
an
excellent
sour
ale
that
holds
up
with
some
of
the
nations
greats
very
glad
to
have
this
beer
at
my
disposal
for
the
foreseeable
future
bottles
batch
1
4
batch
1
was
the
better
of
the
two
imho
clear
garnet
pour
with
an
off
white
head
huge
raspberry
nose
like
eating
a
raspberry
average
body
and
mouthfeel
overall
i
thought
this
was
really
really
good
it
is
lightly
tart
but
not
a
vinegar
bomb
and
very
fruity
has
some
belgianstyle
funk
to
it
too
which
is
really
cool
in
an
american
beer
very
great
would
love
to
have
it
again
nice
red
color
hazy
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
held
good
and
dotted
the
glass
with
lace
musty
aroma
lots
of
raspberry
sweet
and
sour
great
raspberry
profile
in
the
taste
tart
and
crisp
slight
jammy
sweetness
and
a
good
dose
of
wet
oak
crisp
mouthfeel
medium
body
very
nice
overall
for
the
style
i
dont
think
it
can
get
any
better
crisp
and
tart
upfront
yet
somehow
finishes
creamy
i
dont
think
you
can
ask
anymore
out
of
a
wild
within
these
parameters
simply
enough
an
incredible
beer
in
a
weird
way
reminds
me
of
a
shirley
temple
the
deep
ruby
color
looks
epic
in
the
glass
and
you
could
sniff
this
in
a
glass
for
10
minutes
before
even
tasting
it
its
that
good
when
in
its
prime
this
is
so
awesome
its
hard
not
to
guzzle
it
each
individual
sip
has
so
much
flavor
that
lasts
in
your
mouth
though
that
you
can
really
stretch
out
a
glass
over
a
long
time
huge
thanks
to
iwannaeatfood
for
this
one
pretty
fucking
flawless
o
good
but
not
as
good
as
many
other
similar
tasting
raspberry
sours
to
be
honest
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
the
taste
just
wasnt
as
juicy
or
full
as
the
nose
suggested
im
splitting
hairs
though
this
was
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
id
gladly
drink
again
maybe
im
in
the
minority
but
id
like
more
sweet
fruit
and
sour
yang
here
and
i
preferred
the
nose
to
the
taste
a
fun
beer
an
appreciative
opportunity
thanks
bill
but
not
a
great
beer
atrial
rubicite
did
a
great
job
at
melding
a
tart
musty
and
funky
wild
ale
base
with
bright
raspberry
notes
i
can
understand
why
this
beer
receives
such
amazing
scores
personally
however
i
found
the
raspberry
to
be
understated
in
the
flavor
profile
also
i
think
that
this
beer
could
have
benefitted
from
a
bit
more
residual
sweetness
its
got
all
the
things
that
are
good
raspberry
jester
king
funk
and
balance
its
just
spot
on
and
hits
on
sour
more
than
pie
o
outstandingly
refreshing
and
great
complexity
of
fruit
flavor
mingled
with
subtle
tartness
this
is
an
easily
crushable
raspberry
bomb
without
the
cloying
sweetness
great
representation
of
the
style
looks
good
taste
great
as
close
as
wilds
get
to
perfection
more
jam
than
your
grandmas
kitchen
funk
and
straight
raspberry
juice
i
swear
its
like
taking
a
bite
prickly
like
black
cherry
hansens
this
is
the
truth
and
i
want
more
amazing
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
sour
big
tart
and
big
cherryraspberry
i
can
see
the
reason
for
the
hype
o
the
raspberry
flavors
are
so
real
i
caught
myself
having
the
checkforraspberryseedsintheteeth
sensation
but
all
of
the
rich
flavors
present
here
just
disappear
right
at
or
just
after
the
swallow
very
odd
and
not
sure
why
but
this
is
goodvery
good
perhaps
not
the
complexity
to
the
funk
profile
that
cantillon
etc
has
but
more
than
enjoyable
very
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
500
love
this
sour
big
big
raspberry
taste
upfront
with
the
right
amount
of
sour
to
go
with
it
beautiful
purplish
color
with
a
great
nose
well
worth
waiting
for
to
have
it
at
500
overall
a
tasty
raspberry
sour
great
juicy
fruit
taste
with
just
enough
sour
to
it
the
stickler
in
me
wishes
there
was
a
bit
more
in
the
way
of
musty
earthy
funk
complexities
as
this
does
come
off
as
little
onedimensional
another
part
of
me
doesnt
care
because
its
probably
the
best
raspberry
profile
ive
had
in
a
sour
really
great
all
around
a
raspberry
bomb
that
reminds
me
of
any
great
belgian
framboise
and
specifically
of
rose
de
gambrinus
in
the
aroma
biting
assault
of
fresh
raspberries
on
the
taste
buds
with
a
complex
rounded
out
lambic
bug
mix
received
a
2014
april
batch
date
bottle
via
trade
well
worth
the
effort
to
attain
atrial
is
hands
down
the
best
tasting
sour
beer
ive
had
so
far
the
raspberries
were
used
to
perfection
so
much
raspberry
this
is
one
of
the
best
uses
of
raspberry
ever
up
there
with
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
this
beer
is
gorgeous
a
dark
ruby
body
with
a
nice
pink
head
i
certainly
dont
select
beers
based
on
their
looks
but
you
gotta
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
and
this
beer
looks
like
christina
ricci
in
black
snake
moan
raspberries
dominate
the
aroma
a
slight
sour
kick
up
front
in
the
taste
but
then
the
tartness
from
the
raspberries
takes
over
a
little
bit
oakey
acidic
with
a
touch
of
fruity
sweetness
its
def
a
sipper
but
i
think
thats
the
point
of
most
wild
ales
you
could
tell
it
was
unfiltered
and
unpasturized
as
there
was
lots
of
remnants
left
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
loved
every
sip
of
this
beer
and
am
very
thankful
i
got
to
try
it
incredible
sour
incredible
color
very
clean
and
consistent
my
favorite
jk
sour
offering
so
far
one
of
the
most
beautiful
beers
ive
seen
in
the
glass
a
luminous
rubyraspberry
crisp
tart
and
dry
the
raspberry
fruit
is
absolutely
huge
and
bright
yet
it
is
not
cloying
in
any
way
world
class
a
barrel
aged
beauty
of
mature
sour
beer
that
had
several
hundred
pounds
of
raspberries
added
it
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
little
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
of
raspberry
hits
you
immediately
the
taste
is
initially
sour
but
the
tartness
of
the
raspberry
quickly
overtakes
that
it
finishes
slightly
oaky
and
lightly
acidic
its
almost
like
a
berliner
weisse
w
raspberry
syrup
dropped
in
already
im
generally
not
a
sour
beer
fan
at
all
but
this
brew
is
good
the
vibrant
and
fruity
flavor
offsets
the
sourness
very
nicely
light
body
and
effervescent
tons
of
soft
tiny
bubbles
aiding
in
drying
out
the
tongue
and
keeping
it
clean
drink
glad
i
traded
for
it
amazing
color
had
a
nice
dirt
and
grassy
flavor
plenty
of
funk
pleasantly
dry
without
being
overly
sour
an
experience
unbelievable
color
of
pinkish
reddish
beauty
thin
pink

the
smell
is
amazing
just
amazing
raspberry
oak
and
funk
taste
is
perfect
with
acidy
raspberry
jammy
goodness
funk
comes
in
waves
between
the
sweetness
of
the
raspberries
a
phenomenal
beer
pours
out
a
vibrant
red

strongly

super
sour

super
balanced
one
of
the
better

the
beer
is
ruby
hued
with
a
thin

huge
raspberry

funky

with
a
jammy

quality
a
simple
and
straightforward

makes

to

lou

its
been
too
long
delicious
and
teeming
with
flavor
so
much
fruit
fabulous
my
favorite
jester
king
thus
far
incredible
beer
thanks
daniel
o
liked
this
beer
so
much
that
i
picked
up
a
bottle
to
bring
back
to
florida
and
even
bought
an
atrial
rubicite
tshirt
if
youre
finding
this
too
sour
and
not
jammy
enough
makes
sure
to
pour
in
the
dregs
and
let
it
warm
above
fridge
temp
things
really
improve
at
that
point
if
you
like
raspberries
and
sour
ales
look
no
further
the
atrial
rubicite
is
the
most
flavorful
and
delightfully
sour
farmhouse
ale
ive
ever
had
with
a
dominant
raspberry
profile
a
truly
unique
creation
that
is
a
pleasure
with
every
sip
with
food
or
without
pours
a
nice
reddish
beer
very
dark
almost
no
carbonation
form
but
this
is
a
carbonated
beer
aroma
is
of
funky
yeasts
berries
taste
is
really
good
very
sour
but
not
overly
sour
very
drinkable
tastes
like
berries
the
body
is
light
overall
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
one
of
the
best
american
fruited
sours
out
there
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
is
a
little
behind
my
sample
of
framboos
but
truly
well
done
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
very
often
but
it
is
a
very
nice
occasional
treat
overall
my
favorites
were
b1
and
b4
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
this
beer
to
give
it
a
better
balance
i
considered
running
out
and
grabbing
a
bottle
of
ng
rasberry
tart
to
mix
a
bit
but
was
too
lazy
would
love
to
try
that
combo
in
the
future
pours
an
almost
ruby
red
color
with
a
2
finger
reddish
head
the
disappears
very
quickly
on
the
nose
you
get
slight
oak
with
really
strong
acidic
raspberries
the
taste
is
awesome
great
pucker
from
the
raspberries
great
oak
notes
just
what
i
expected
it
is
definitely
sour
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
and
then
a
little
dry
overall
a
fantastic
beer
love
the
tartness
overall
excellent
and
better
than
blend
4
but
not
by
much
just
a
more
complex
sour
beer
even
though
it
has
less
of
a
raspberry
jammy
flavor
o
jester
king
is
really
doing
great
things
and
i
can
see
why
they
are
highly
regarded
probably
put
this
around
6
or
so
roughly
in
the
belgian
domestic
raspberry
sourlambic
categories
o
jester
king
really
knows
what
they
are
doing
with
fruited
sours
and
atrial
did
not
disappoint
i
love
how
they
capture
the
fresh
fruit
presence
and
a
beautiful
color
without
making
it
taste
artificial
or
too
syrupy
definitely
recommend
checking
this
out
as
its
one
of
the
better
american
fruited
sours
out
there
right
now
perfect
summertime
beer
o
while
this
was
very
very
good
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
i
wouldnt
be
hot
to
seek
this
out
likely
because
i
favor
nocturn
chrysalis
excellently
crafted
seek
this
one
out
not
a
berrybomb
but
a
pretty
sour
masterpiece
with
raspberries
to
compliment
this
beer
pours
like
raspberry
juice
it
is
deep
magenta
not
light
pink
like
some
other
fruited
sours
the
pillowy
pink
head
is
really
neat
when
you
pour
it
vigorously
the
nose
is
so
deeply
jammy
i
detect
very
little
tartness
on
the
nose
and
a
hint
of
oak
it
smells
like
straight
jam
the
taste
didnt
quite
deliver
on
the
nose
the
sour
level
was
perfect
for
me
its
nicely
tart
like
an
unripe
raspberry
i
just
dont
get
the
distinct
jamminess
that
was
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
i
could
use
a
tad
more
carbonation
this
beer
is
so
light
and
flavorful
that
it
is
an
ease
to
drink
alone
with
only
a
slight
bit
of
sour
stomach
after
a
whole
bottle
the
raspberry
delivers
on
the
finish
as
this
beer
warms
intricate
and
simple
raspberry
at
the
same
time
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
fruit
wilds
we
live
in
good
beer
times
thanks
for
this
kojevergas
a
beer
i
never
thought
id
get
to
try
batch
3
shared
by
ineedabeerhere
thanks
joe
pours
a
raspberry
hue
with
a
frothy
pink
head
that
dissipates
into
a
cluster
of
bubbles
around
one
side
of
the
glass
nose
reveals
tart
raspberries
and
a
faint
medicinal
quality
towards
the
back
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
flavors
are
a
bit
more
muted
and
there
is
also
a
salty
character
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
some
astringency
a
very
good
beer
but
the
fruit
is
too
subdued
and
the
salty
quality
is
a
bit
too
assertive
o
batch
1
is
rather
unremarkable
batch
2
on
the
other
hand
is
a
significant
improvement
although
it
lacks
depth
o
the
best
american
raspberry
sour
ive
had
for
sure
not
overly
sour
but
it
makes
up
for
it
in
every
other
way
gorgeous
i
want
some
more
of
atrial
overall
this
is
a
really
awesome
jk
wild
ale
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
raspberry
berlinner
weisse
beer
like
august
schells
fram
du
nord
this
beer
is
definately
a
coolship
beer
and
it
was
noticed
in
the
feel
of
this
beer
overall
very
good
american
raspberry
sour
this
is
what
i
wish
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
was
id
venture
that
cantillon
rosé
de
gambrinus
is
very
similar
and
lou
pepe
framboise
kills
this
10
times
out
of
10
but
still
this
is
the
best
american
attempt
at
a
raspberry
sour
certainly
in
the
neighborhood
of
framboise
for
a
cure
certainly
the
best
that
jester
king
has
released
since
they
switched
to
the
all
farmhouse
stuff
is
it
worth
the
price
effort
to
obtain
and
hype
maybe
not
though
it
is
damn
good
well
done
verdict
a
tremendous
effort
from
jester
king
and
easily
one
of
the
most
impressive
american
wild
ales
ive
tried
to
date
its
fresh
vibrant
delicate
and
bright
and
very
quaffable
the
balance
is
great
not
overly
sour
not
overly
sweet
not
overly
fruit
centric
everything
is
in
its
proper
place
this
can
easily
rival
any
of
the
belgian
lambics
that
employ
raspberry
a
must
try
o
one
of
the
better
raspberry
sours
ive
had
not
overly
sweet
but
still
with
an
apparent
raspberry
presence
great
beer
o
pretty
tasty
definitely
fruitforward
and
sweetish
but
with
enough
funk
and
sour
though
not
quite
enough
oak
to
offset
those
qualities
and
provide
some
balance
lives
up
to
the
hype
as
one
of
the
best
fruit
wild
ales
ive
had
pour
is
clear
deep
blood
red
with
a
white
head
nose
is
big
time
fleshy
cherry
and
cherry
pit
almost
a
cherry
pie
filling
aroma
cherry
flesh
up
front
the
bret
and
acidity
take
over
and
make
a
presence
not
seen
in
the
nose
good
carb
and
a
very
dry
finish
on
a
meaty
body
drink
now
acidity
will
probably
take
over
in
time
o
definitely
my
new
favorite
raspberry
sour
bow
down
raspberry
tart
and
rose
de
gambrinus
o
ar
is
a
fun
beer
a
truly
excellent
take
on
a
style
thats
difficult
for
american
breweries
to
capture
its
sweet
tangy
yeasty
and
sour
i
cower
at
how
much
this
beer
costs
but
i
would
never
turn
it
down
in
the
future
o
really
impressed
by
this
one
it
had
everything
i
enjoy
in
a
raspberry
sour
and
nothing
was
out
of
proportion
really
looking
forward
to
visiting
the
brewery
in
a
few
weeks
if
their
other
beers
are
as
good
as
this
it
should
be
an
awesome
trip
o
nice
tartness
and
tons
and
tons
of
raspberries
dark
pinkred
in
color
with
a
smallish
pink
head
after
a
pretty
vigorous
pour
the
smell
had
be
a
bit
worried
at
first
because
it
is
dominated
by
sweet
jammy
raspberries
much
like
rubaeus
and
raspberry
tart
however
the
taste
is
very
sour
and
the
sourness
combines
really
well
with
the
fruit
to
create
a
fantastic
beer
not
the
most
complex
sour
but
very
enjoyable
edited
after
also
having
blends
03
small
sample
04
full
pour
o
overall
this
beer
is
just
delicious
and
the
nose
the
nose
is
incredible
this
was
worth
the
wait
merry
christmas
to
me
a
bit
one
dimensional
its
a
raspberry
tart
beverage
its
hard
to
tell
this
is
a
beer
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
but
considering
the
price
for
the
amount
you
get
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
pours
an
awesome
bright
red
with
a
beautiful
one
finger
pink
head
smells
like
raspberry
with
a
little
funk
and
oak
in
there
taste
is
raspberry
forward
with
some
funk
at
the
end
nice
carbonation
and
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
really
sour
as
well
easy
to
drink
though
very
fruity
with
some
other
nice
barrel
flavors
as
well

very

an
extremely
delicious
and
well
balanced
offering
o
its
so
hard
being
objective
on
some
of
these
really
hyped
beers
im
glad
i
tried
this
9
months
after
bottling
as
i
am
sure
some
of
the
flavors
simmered
down
just
a
bit
did
it
live
up
to
the
hype
no
but
thats
not
why
i
tried
it
as
a
huge
fan
of
raspberry
beers
i
was
very
very
happy
to
try
this
one
it
met
my
expectations
as
far
as
what
i
had
hoped
for
a
really
enjoyable
raspberry
wild
ale
o
this
is
a
really
well
put
together
beer
and
by
far
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
jester
king
to
date
if
you
like
raspberries
this
is
a
must
get
looking
forward
to
future
batches
as
well
as
future
jk
coolship
projects
well
i
must
say
that
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
impeccable
it
pours
a
bright
cherry
red
which
just
glows
in
the
glass
nose
is
an
absolute
raspberry
bomb
the
fruit
is
fresh
and
there
are
even
earthy
notes
of
soil
in
the
back
some
perceived
tartness
towards
the
finish
of
the
smell
taste
is
quite
acidic
up
front
creating
a
nice
pucker
some
raspberry
sweetness
follows
and
balances
well
with
the
sourness
this
beer
is
chick
full
of
bold
and
big
flavors
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
effervescent
carbonation
this
is
a
winner
from
jester
king
update
blend
four
a
very
different
beer
much
more
fruit
forward
by
comparison
bright
tartness
clean
and
puckering
lactic
acidity
light
raspberry
taste
palate
scrubbing
carbonation
not
a
lot
of
depth
or
complexity
unfortunately
but
tart
and
fruity
seems
like
any
other
raspberry
wild
ale
out
there
not
sure
where
all
the
hype
stems
from
raspberry
ananke
is
far
better
o
very
good
raspberry
wild
ale
worthy
of
the
attention
and
hype
it
is
receiving
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
will
have
to
keep
this
one
on
my
list
in
hopes
of
coming
across
another
bottle
or
two
still
a
personal
want
ticked
off
but
just
not
what
i
expected
i
went
in
with
high
hopes
now
i
am
really
contemplating
keeping
my
other
for
drinking
ugh
decisions
what
more
can
you
ask
of
a
beer
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
certainly
the
best
in
recent
memory
since
my
mid
august
fou
foune
drlovemd87
deserves
a
shout
out
for
bringing
this
rarity
over
lets
start
with
the
color
holy
goodness
i
have
never
seen
a
beer
so
radiantly
ruby
red
in
my
life
the
color
of
raspberries
mashed
in
a
mortar
and
pestle
right
after
being
picked
hints
of
pink
highlight
the
reds
looks
like
fresh
jam
bright
and
gorgeous
show
me
a
prettier
fruit
beer
ive
never
seen
one
small
but
sturdy
white
head
not
stained
pink
in
the
least
impressive
and
sexy
like
whipped
topping
now
the
smell
oh
oh
oh
the
smell
tart
and
mouthwatering
like
raspberry
jam
acidic
lacto
bacterial
fermentation
notes
too
but
not
overpowering
and
no
vinegar
at
all
its
funky
but
its
summery
too
and
seemingly
perfect
for
fall
the
fruit
is
so
fresh
i
can
taste
it
the
quality
shines
through
here
the
taste
is
even
better
than
the
nose
everything
i
want
and
nothing
i
dont
perfect
i
never
give
perfect
scores
and
i
have
to
here
no
place
to
improve
in
taste
the
berries
are
forward
but
not
at
al
sweet
the
sour
elements
are
all
lined
up
pucker
and
dry
but
not
burning
or
angry
just
balanced
still
supremely
drinkable
not
too
much
alcohol
just
right
no
gimmicks
carbonated
like
a
champagne
it
really
pops
off
in
my
mouth
cant
believe
how
alive
and
active
this
is
and
how
there
is
not
a
lick
of
residual
sugar
here
its
dry
and
fruity
as
it
finishes
the
robustness
of
the
berries
and
the
balanced
yet
complex
sour
flavors
are
the
takeaways
for
me
and
that
color
of
course
its
like
absolutely
nothing
else
out
there
and
i
would
kill
to
have
a
steady
stream
of
it
never
thought
i
liked
fruited
beer
so
if
you
are
in
that
boat
this
is
a
life
changer
worth
every
bit
of
hype
trade
value
and
praise
it
has
received
and
then
some
it
takes
a
lot
to
blow
me
away
these
days
and
jester
king
has
done
just
that
it
is
the
standard
by
which
all
fruit
beer
and
maybe
even
all
sour
beer
will
no
be
measured
as
close
to
perfect
as
they
get
wow
just
wow
stop
at
nothing
to
acquire
this
contact
me
if
youve
got
extras
my
appetite
is
now
insatiable
o
this
is
the
best
fruit
sour
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
at
the
funk
and
sour
fest
i
probably
got
8
samples
of
this
amazing
beer
o
this
beer
is
incredible
absolutely
mind
blowing
tons
of
fruit
character
i
am
glad
i
drank
my
one
bottle
fresh
as
i
can
imagine
it
will
fade
over
time
drink
it
now
this
is
delicious
pours
dark
red
with
a
pink
layer
of
bubbles
on
top
looks
cloudy
good
retention
for
a
sour
easy
to
swirl
up
more
foam
smells
great
very
jammy
lots
of
fruit
the
berries
come
through
strong
and
tasty
not
a
lot
of
funk
mild
oak
but
it
might
just
be
overshadowed
by
the
fruit
taste
is
a
step
back
from
the
aroma
the
fruit
is
still
the
dominant
note
but
its
not
as
jammy
as
i
expected
from
the
aroma
funk
is
mild
again
more
oak
shows
up
quite
dry
its
tasty
but
theres
not
much
depth
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drying
good
sour
but
the
yeastbacteria
blend
just
isnt
quite
there
yet
for
me
would
definite
get
again
a
the
random
shit
you
learn
thanks
to
beer
apparently
rubicite
is
a
material
found
in
many
mmos
that
is
bright
red
in
appearance
and
is
normally
associated
with
hp
regeneration
the
more
you
know
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
magenta
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
dank
raspberries
mild
barnyard
funk
sour
blue
raspberry
and
a
twinge
of
green
apple
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
apple
now
more
apple
vinegarlike
and
the
overall
level
of
tartness
greatly
increased
its
bright
its
fruity
its
tart
its
kinda
funky
and
it
works
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
damn
fine
sour
raz
drink
one
whose
greatness
was
only
impugned
by
the
fact
that
it
followed
other
stellar
sours
in
the
same
night
still
it
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
m
medium
bodied
dry
appearance
is
one
of
deep
dark
maroon
blood
red
body
with
amazing
pink
lace
that
leaves
its
foamy
bubbly
fingers
along
the
sides
of
my
glass
beautiful
to
say
the
least
the
smell
is
like
a
raspberry
tart
with
that
funk
i
recognize
from
many
other
jk
offerings
the
taste
is
instant
with
raspberry
and
quickly
tart
on
the
tongue
with
lactic
tinge
this
beer
is
such
a
fine
example
of
what
i
like
in
a
fruited
sour
to
this
point
in
my
life
i
really
look
forward
to
more
special
releases
from
jester
king
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
especially
for
a
first
foray
into
the
world
of
fruit
it
is
clearly
dominated
by
way
more
raspberries
than
were
needed
but
nothing
exceeds
like
excess
i
like
to
say
way
to
go
jeff
and
michael
you
hit
the
cover
off
the
ball
on
your
first
attempt
at
a
fruited
sour
i
really
like
the
softer
acidity
as
it
wasnt
sharp
and
therefore
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
many
of
unfortunately
there
arent
many
of
these
to
be
had
if
you
were
lucky
enough
to
get
a
few
bottles
then
guard
these
with
your
life
as
people
who
are
in
the
know
will
steal
them
without
reservation
i
am
an
admitted
jester
king
fanboy
and
had
been
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
while
i
was
hopingexpecting
perhaps
misguidedly
for
more
of
a
sour
beer
this
is
a
beautifully
executed
beer
drinks
like
a
legit
fruited
lambic
and
itll
probably
be
good
with
some
age
on
it
in
all
i
do
really
enjoy
this
beer
im
glad
to
see
jk
finally
achieve
the
level
of
farmhouse
that
they
are
going
for
it
takes
a
while
to
hone
this
technique
down
looking
for
the
other
installments
from
them
cheers
overall
this
beer
will
become
famous
that
im
sure
of
certainly
my
favorite
of
jester
kings
very
interesting
selection
im
going
to
be
drinking
those
bottles
very
slowly
it
will
be
interesting
first
to
see
how
the
bottle
differs
from
the
draught
version
and
second
to
see
how
the
beer
ages
over
time
im
excited
will
drink
this
only
on
special
occasions
for
sure
been
waiting
for
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
have
to
say
it
was
worth
the
wait
as
with
most
jester
king
beers
at
this
point
you
have
to
be
onboard
with
their
approach
to
like
their
beers
but
if
youve
signed
on
to
their
old
world
farmhouse
approach
to
brewing
then
this
is
likely
to
be
a
new
favorite
and
is
a
standout
in
their
lineup
i
drink
this
beer
and
i
wonder
was
this
really
made
in
texas
texans
are
lucky
to
have
jester
king
around
their
hard
work
is
reflected
100
by
atrial
rubicite
o
weve
been
waiting
so
long
for
jk
to
do
a
fruited
sour
and
they
delivered
in
spectacular
fashion
price
point
was
a
bit
high
but
it
obviously
didnt
stop
me
from
buying
it
definitely
in
my
top
3
american
wild
ales
overall
one
of
my
favorite
raspberry
sours
has
all
the
fresh
fruit
flavor
you
could
want
along
with
a
big
jam
like
essence
its
super
dry
and
acidity
is
right
smack
where
i
like
it
the
house
culture
helps
put
this
on
a
level
few
exist
all
in
all
this
is
jester
kings
maestro
performance
to
date
call
me
a
homer
but
ive
traveled
and
consumed
rose
de
gam
at
its
source
in
brussels
and
i
think
this
beer
is
on
par
in
terms
of
tx
beer
papas
got
a
brand
new
bag
o
not
bad
and
a
good
entry
into
sours
for
jk
definitely
not
the
best
raspberry
sour
out
there
this
beautiful
raspberry
sour
was
a
delight
for
my
wife
and
i
we
visited
jk
this
past
sunday
for
the
ar
release
and
allocation
pick
up
glad
to
try
batch
2
on
draft
the
smell
does
not
even
come
close
to
the
taste
of
pure
raspberries
fresh
the
deep
red
raspberry
color
is
just
one
more
reason
to
love
this
beer
loveitman
overall
i
think
this
is
the
best
beer
made
in
texas
yet
id
strongly
argue
for
it
being
included
in
any
discussion
about
best
beers
in
america
jester
king
not
only
has
created
a
great
beer
theyve
created
a
masterpiece
i
cant
wait
to
drink
more
of
this
beautiful
pink
hue
slightly
hazed
with
a
thin
sheet
of
head
sour
raspberry
jam
oak
and
some
jk
barnyard
yeast
bright
raspberry
flavor
but
solid
balance
between
malts
and
funk
as
well
slightly
tannic
with
a
solid
finish
keeps
me
going
back
for
more
overl
a
fantastic
fruited
wild
ale
and
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
jk
the
only
thing
i
would
prefer
more
would
be
a
lp
framboise
but
thats
a
different
style
of
beer
and
not
exactly
a
fair
comparison
people
might
think
this
is
a
homer
review
but
ive
never
had
a
raspberry
american
wild
as
good
as
this
one
o
without
being
blasphemous
i
would
say
very
close
with
a
lot
of
belgian
frambroises
the
best
american
raspberry
beer
i
have
tried
had
batch
2
on
tap
at
jester
king
for
the
bottle
release
the
color
is
near
amazing
up
there
with
a
number
of
high
caliber
fruited
sours
that
i
have
had
along
the
way
smell
promises
the
fruitiness
and
tartness
to
come
light
pink
head
dissipates
quickly
jammy
raspberry
taste
with
tart
dryness
in
the
finish
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
the
flavor
has
developed
in
the
bottles
which
are
6
months
older
than
this
tap
batch
the
flavor
is
tart
and
dry
with
vinous
raspberry
juices
puckering
the
sides
of
the
tongue
a
hint
of
leather
and
wood
from
the
barrels
blends
perfectly
with
the
delicate
raspberry
note
acidity
is
light
but
enough
to
balance
the
funky
yeast
good
carbonation
refreshingly
tart
and
slick
on
the
tongue
with
a
medium
body
atrial
rubicite
is
very
complex
and
very
well
crafted
probably
jester
kings
nay
the
entire
state
of
texass
finest
beer
to
date
o
this
is
by
far
the
best
thing
to
come
out
of
jester
king
theyve
taken
their
game
to
the
next
level
with
this
offering
dont
miss
it
if
you
have
the
chance
ps
ill

at
zwanze
day

jester
king

saturday

one
bottle

my
allocation

this
yet
ill

it
with
you
bm
me
first
come
first
served
out
of
staters
get
first
priority
had
this
on
tap
at
the
jester
king
release
it
looks
like
blood
amazing
color
the
nose
is
tart
and
acidic
with
a
raspberry
note
you
know
you
are
about
to
dive
in
to
something
fantastic
i
have
been
hearing
friend
talk
of
this
beer
for
the
last
couple
months
i
have
always
seem
to
miss
out
on
it
pre
release
also
with
jester
king
sours
they
can
be
hit
or
miss
this
one
is
a
god
damn
homerun
the
sourness
is
there
the
tartness
is
there
and
has
that
reeal
raspberry
taste
not
artificial
like
some
raspberry
sours
can
be
the
carbonation
level
was
spot
on
and
i
wish
i
could
have
gotten
more
than
3
bottles
for
drinking
them
this
beer
just
wins
over
in
sheer
deliciousness
overall
i
am
very
pleased
this
is
a
nonblended
barrel
aged
wild
ale
did
i
mention
raspberries
that
isnt
over
sour
and
is
refreshing
and
simply
delightful
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
one
i
knew
the
style
and
the
hype
but
having
had
several
misses
and
not
always
being
one
to
go
by
popular
opinion
my
expectations
were
not
high
but
this
beer
very
much
surpassed
all
i
had
hoped
for
pours
a
hazy
dark
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
raspberry
and
oak
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
raspberry
and
oak
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
very
nice
fresh
sour
raspberry
presence
price
point
was
a
bit
high
but
i
would
spend
the
16
on
a
bottle
time
and
time
again
for
the
quality
one
gets
from
this
cant
wait
to
drink
this
again
my
only
regret
is
that
i
only
have
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
fantastic
brew
left
to
last
me
a
year
overall
amazing
one
of
the
best
raspberry
beers
ive
ever
had
very
well
done
i
wish
i
had
more
of
it
o
jester
king
nailed
this
style
this
is
by
far
one
of
if
not
their
best
offering
i
had
this
after
cantillon
st
lamnivus
and
cantillon
oude
geuze
and
this
blew
those
out
of
the
water
the
execution
on
this
beer
is
just
flawless
i
havent
had
a
beer
that
incorporated
raspberries
this
well
cheers
to
jester
king
and
thanks
to
jeff
for
sharing
2
bottles
of
this
really
good
sour
nice
and
tart
but
not
a
lot
of
apricot
overall
a
very
good
beer
super
sour
especially
in
the
taste
lots
of
fruit
and
vinegar
kind
of
reminded
me
of
some
bruery
sours
a
4
oz
pour
was
perfect
for
me
ebf
sample
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
smell
is
a
pretty
intense
sourness
this
beer
is
brewed
with
apricots
and
after
finding
this
out
i
can
totally
get
it
flavor
is
very
bright
and
tart
a
mixture
of
various
unripe
fruits
white
wine
lemons
acidity
apricots
finishes
with
some
oak
the
flavor
lingers
and
lingers
leaving
tart
bright
fruits
a
nicely
concocted
sour
brew
with
a
fresh
pale
fruity
flavor
memorable
pours
a
very
opaque
golden
yellow
with
a
finger
to
finger
and
a
half
of
nice
white
head
smells
like
lemon
i
had
a
real
hard
time
picking
up
the
apricot
taste
followed
and
agreed
with
my
nose
this
one
is
at
my
upper
limits
of
sourness
which
is
a
good
thing
will
definitely
seek
out
and
drink
again
and
again
and
again
nice
apricot
presence
and
sour
base
does
not
overwhelm
very
good
but
not
worth
the
oz
othis
may
be
my
favorite
almanac
beer
it
is
easily
one
of
the
best
sour
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
other
sours
and
that
may
be
ok
because
the
fruit
flavor
here
is
very
clean
and
pure
no
bourbon
or
tequila
or
whatever
barrel
intrudes
it
is
just
fruit
and
it
is
delicious
very
sour
good
fruit
flavor
its
a
very
nice
sour
beer
however
aurelian
lure
is
my
favorite
beer
and
this
is
much
less
balanced
that
al
the
sour
overwhelms
the
pallet
leaving
the
apricots
in
its
wake
smell
is
good
surprisingly
underwhelming
lacking
in
depth
fruit
character
and
far
too
light
bodied
for
barrel
aging
a
decent
wild
brew
sure
but
doesnt
come
off
as
anything
special
let
alone
memorable
good
not
great
compared
to
others
in
series
apricot
flavor
is
pretty
overshadowed
by
sour
ale
base
itd
be
hard
to
guess
that
its
apricot
if
i
didnt
know
beforehand
great
sour
a
beer
glad
i
stocked
up
this
is
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
sour
and
in
my
opinion
far
better
than
any
almanac
beer
the
body
has
some
very
enjoyable
floral
notes
with
a
lot
of
apricots
and
cherries
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
acidity
but
it
is
not
overbearing
what
i
enjoy
most
about
this
beer
is
its
earthiness
and
the
fact
that
everything
tastes
so
fresh
particularly
the
apricots
and
cherries
i
would
say
that
the
bottle
version
can
be
hazier
than
on
tap
and
although
it
probably
looks
better
on
tap
it
ages
very
well
with
more
noticeable
barrel
qualities
over
time
aged
bottle
feb
2013
oh
so
good
this
one
had
apricots
loquats
and
cherries
the
new
batch
2015
has
solely
apricots
cant
wait
to
taste
the
new
batch
after
cellaring
a
year
or
two
overall
i
think
ive
decided
that
stonefruit
are
my
favorite
fruits
to
be
added
to
sour
beers
and
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
one
those
expectations
feel
just
a
bit
short
because
the
extreme
tartness
drowned
out
a
lot
of
the
apricot
flavor
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
a
great
beer
but
is
similar
to
most
almanac
sours
ive
had
in
that
it
is
very
good
but
not
remarkable
4
paws
hazy
burnt
amber
color
mildly
fruity
nose
smells
of
pears
and
apricots
tastes
like
a
good
sour
ale
should
light
bodied
tartness
like
dried
fruit
from
a
bulk
bin
beautiful
semiopaque
golden
yellow
smells
fruity
peachy
but
not
tart
but
it
tastes
very
tart
delicious
puckery
very
much
to
my
liking
overall
either
we
got
a
pretty
bad
bottle
or
i
really
dont
get
why
this
isso
highly
rated
completely
onedimensional
so
not
really
complex
and
not
easily
drinkable
either
woooo
super
up
front
sourness
almost
like
sucking
on
a
lemon
faint
hints
of
the
apricot
and
whatever
the
hell
a
loquat
is
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
wine
barrel
its
delicious
overall
excellent
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
american
wild
ales
ive
tried
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
o
very
nice
awa
i
certainly
liked
this
one
even
at
its
high
price
point
at
17
for
a
375ml
it
lacks
any
kind
of
funk
but
the
acidity
and
fruit
flavours
is
up
to
par
with
some
of
the
other
highlyregarded
american
wild
ales
out
there
o
apricot
and
loquat
all
the
way
a
unique
and
delicious
flavor
profile
with
a
solid
tartness
theres
no
avoiding
the
chunks
with
this
one
though
overall
i
was
really
hoping
this
one
would
be
more
sour
and
fruity
the
fruit
is
very
subtle
the
wine
smells
and
flavors
are
a
bit
more
than
i
look
for
in
this
type
of
beer
too
strong
on
the
vinegar
but
that
may
not
have
been
the
case
fresh
but
overall
a
decent
drinking
beer
not
bad
at
all
here
tastes
great
but
could
be
a
little
more
i
think
o
a
mouth
puckering
ale
that
focus
more
on
pure
fruity
sour
notes
with
not
a
lot
of
funk
the
notes
from
the
wine
barrels
are
subtle
but
compliment
it
nicely
overall
a
very
solid
beer
i
would
have
rated
this
a
4
but
the
particles
really
become
a
problem
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
and
the
small
occasional
hints
of
plastic
were
offputting
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
awa
the
amount
of
sediment
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
as
probably
13rd
of
the
bottle
is
like
drinking
high
pulp
orange
juice
another
solid
offering
from
almanac
the
palate
opens
sharply
sour
with
a
blend
of
lactic
acid
raw
apricot
peach
skins
and
cherry
sourness
this
is
followed
by
a
lemony
mid
palate
that
enhances
the
acidity
drying
and
sour
on
the
finish
with
fleshy
fruit
and
a
sourness
not
unlike
aged
foufoune
read
heading
in
an
unpleasant
direction
minimal
wine
barrel
character
here
although
a
moderate
grape
character
is
present
light
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
this
is
solid
stuff
o
not
as
aggressively
sour
as
most
awas
in
this
class
but
a
great
exercise
in
balance
between
acidity
and
fruit
character
love
it
and
wish
i
had
another
bottle
o
the
full
dept
of
tartness
blends
with
some
more
acidic
fruit
character
that
is
bright
and
is
nicely
melded
together
very
tasty
overall
another
great
almanac
sour
they
really
know
how
to
make
great
sour
beers
consistently
this
is
at
the
top
tier
of
the
almanac
sours
that
i
have
tried
so
far
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
almanac
sours
i
have
been
able
to
try
it
is
fruity
and
tart
yet
not
so
tart
as
to
make
you
pucker
just
a
very
good
beer
overall
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
yellow
with
noticeable
carbonation
but
minimal
head
retention
there
are
flocks
of
settling
yeast
and
strands
of
pulp
visible
as
well
the
nose
is
tart
and
fruity
with
notes
of
dogs
breath
honey
apricot
pit
and
hinting
cherries
and
acetone
the
taste
is
fruity
and
funky
with
lemony
acidity
a
grainy
backbone
and
lingering
apricots
in
the
finish
its
light
bodied
with
approachable
sourness
a
recognizable
fruit
presence
ample
carbonation
and
a
dry
fruity
finish
this
beer
although
pricey
is
incredibly
wellhoned
and
drinks
with
minimal
complaints
perfect
for
summer
overall
a
really
nice
clean
refreshing
sour
a
step
below
some
of
the
best
gueuzes
ive
tried
but
still
enjoyable
glorious
apricots
that
must
have
been
picked
by
aphrodite
because
raul
just
cannot
he
cannot
o
if
you
prefer
sourness
over
fruit
presence
youll
love
this
not
my
thing
although
i
can
appreciate
its
qualities
pours
hazy
copper
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
aroma
of
sour
and
tart
notes
some
apricots
and
cherry
notes
pale
malts
light
wine
notes
and
oak
notes
and
hints
of
spices
flavor
the
same
with
a
great
blend
average
texture
a
really
cool
beer
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
modest
carbonation
plenty
of
tartness
that
gets
minorly
acidic
when
it
warms
up
with
a
bounty
of
fruit
and
barrel
character
to
balance
it
all
out
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
thanks
again
anotherjoe
overall
overly
sour
for
me
detracts
from
the
fruit
flavor
but
amplifies
the
grain
o
finally
i
geat
a
good
almanac
very
nice
fruit
and
funk
o
a
really
nice
welldone
sour
quite
light
enjoyable
and
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
almanacs
smallbottle
sour
series
excellent
beer
pours
an
orangey
yellow
color
its
quite
cloudy
some
sediment
chunks
floating
around
the
head
is
white
with
fine
bubbles
lots
of
lacing
residue
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
good
retention
kinda
odd
for
a
sour
lots
of
fruit
in
the
aroma
particularly
big
on
apricot
from
what
i
remember
from
trying
loquats
thats
also
fairly
strong
cherries
are
a
bit
in
the
background
though
definitely
noticeable
mild
wine
some
oak
a
bit
of
cheesiness
could
use
some
cleaning
up
but
its
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
almanac
mild
lactic
note
taste
is
medium
sour
lots
of
underripe
apricot
some
oak
dryness
still
fairly
messy
with
a
moderate
amount
of
bile
flavor
i
really
dont
know
exactly
what
the
flavor
is
but
it
bothers
me
in
a
number
of
american
sours
some
pale
malt
character
lingers
in
the
background
mediumlight
feel
somewhat
effervescent
good
sour
near
the
top
of
almanacs
releases
for
me
if
they
could
just
clean
up
whatever
causes
that
bileish
taste
id
be
a
much
bigger
fan
a
really
awesome
fruit
beer
here
not
totally
sure
what
a
loquat
is
maybe
another
asian
citrus
type
hard
to
pick
it
out
not
knowing
what
it
is
the
beer
is
hazy
pale
orange
colored
without
much
head
or
visible
carbonation
but
its
far
from
flat
in
the
feel
just
looks
it
the
nose
is
apricot
heavy
thats
the
only
fruit
i
really
smell
maybe
a
little
lemon
and
also
some
hectic
sourness
more
than
brett
this
is
lacto
heavy
clean
though
and
mouth
watering
the
flavor
starts
wight
he
fuzzy
and
ripe
apricots
and
then
the
sourness
that
starts
with
a
lemony
tartness
and
progresses
to
full
blow
caustic
acidity
the
finish
finally
shows
the
cherries
in
this
tart
and
red
and
juicy
which
is
an
unexpected
flavor
for
the
color
and
an
even
more
interesting
twist
for
the
sourness
to
cling
on
to
a
crockery
malt
base
is
basically
irrelevant
here
as
the
fruit
and
bacteria
do
all
of
the
flavoring
this
series
of
little
bottle
special
farm
stuff
from
almanac
has
been
a
pleasure
to
drink
through
so
far
they
seem
to
have
a
real
grasp
for
getting
authentic
fruit
flavors
is
dry
sour
beer
its
real
tasty
and
aside
from
the
sourdough
this
may
be
my
personal
favorite
big
thanks
as
always
to
drlovemd87
for
sharing
another
great
and
highly
drinkable
wild
from
almanac
hazy
orangeish
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
smell
has
a
lot
going
on
and
i
get
a
good
amount
of
peaches
you
can
tell
this
one
is
going
to
be
sour
taste
is
massively
lip
puckering
and
by
far
their
sourest
beer
to
date
great
fruit
notes
throughout
and
the
finish
is
on
point
with
a
lasting
fruit
flavor
love
this
stuff
lip
puckering
sourness
thoroughout
great
job
valley
of
the
hearts
delight
is
one
of
the
better
more
complex
american
wilds
ive
had
in
recent
memory
its
brightly
acidic
fruity
lactic
and
has
that
great
sweet
and
sour
give
and
take
going
a
really
great
beer
i
highly
recommend
o
an
excellent
wild
ale
and
another
awesome
entry
into
almanacs
farm
to
barrel
series
the
complexity
of
flavors
on
display
is
quite
impressive
absolutely
loving
the
apricots
in
this
not
as
sour
as
some
but
presents
a
depth
and
wellroundedness
that
should
be
applauded
i
really
dig
this
beer
and
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
hmmm
as
this
warms
it
begins
to
smell
like
latex
that
cant
be
good
had
to
drain
pour
the
last
5
ounces
because
of
the
massive
chunks
floating
around
o
a
deft
balance
of
fruit
and
sour
fairly
restrained
for
an
american
wild
ale
o
very
good
peach
sour
thanks
jeff
hazy
peach
body
lots
of
ripe
fruit
apricot
peach
cherry
grapes
vinous
and
oak
notes
from
the
wine
barrels
compliment
everything
nicely
nice
tartness
a
bit
of
lemon
citrus
dry
finish
good
stuff
the
best
of
the
latest
batch
of
almanac
beers
lovely
golden
yellow
that
just
looks
like
summer
ripe
fruit
nose
that
is
solid
but
not
huge
this
one
is
quite
a
bit
more
sour
than
most
almanacs
but
quite
amazing
the
interplay
between
the
fruit
is
superb
you
get
hints
of
tart
cherries
citrusy
apricots
and
perhaps
loquats
as
the
beer
rolls
over
your
tongue
the
pucker
keeps
things
taut
and
crisp
this
is
super
refreshing
one
of
the
best
from
almanac
a
very
well
done
fruit
sour
the
fruits
add
to
the
experience
and
are
very
well
integrated
the
only
real
knock
is
some
aftertaste
of
bready
malt
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
overall
experience
the
amount
of
sediment
is
also
a
little
strange
the
bottom
half
of
the
bottle
was
a
beer
smoothie
was
my
bottle
filled
from
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
bottom
line
easy
drinking
and
tasty
o
incredible
its
kinda
like
a
fruity
berliner
weisse
but
they
didnt
mention
the
use
of
any
wheat
oan
amazing
citrus
driven
sour
there
are
beers
that
are
more
sour
but
the
fruit
flavor
in
this
beer
is
amazing
pours
a
hazy
golden
wheat
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
goes
down
quickly
scent
is
very
fruity
up
front
not
sweet
fruit
but
the
kinda
fruit
aroma
you
get
when
you
walk
through
a
field
of
trees
or
plants
that
grow
fruit
tart
aromas
with
a
hint
of
chardonnay
more
chardonnay
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
taste
is
very
tart
up
front
loquats
lemons
and
apricots
provide
a
lovely
fruity
balance
the
cherries
are
very
difficult
to
find
in
the
flavor
this
one
is
pretty
sour
a
good
amount
of
wine
barrel
im
assuming
chardonnay
barrels
were
uses
the
fruit
and
sourness
mesh
so
well
with
this
one
has
a
slight
wheat
flavor
to
it
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
somewhat
puckering
drinkability
is
extremely
high
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
to
me
it
drinks
like
a
berliner
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
you
could
tell
me
the
abv
was
4
0
and
i
would
believe
it
a
lovely
dry
sour
ale
with
a
lot
of
stone
fruit
flavor
farm
to
barrel
concept
with
local
cherries
and
apricots
really
enjoyed
this
sour
one
that
is
easy
to
find
and
worth
the
try
high
recommendation
pour
is
deep
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
fairly
tight
white
head
nose
is
fruity
with
a
balance
of
dry
wood
peaches
seem
most
prevalent
of
the
fruits
involved
but
there
is
a
tartness
in
back
taste
actually
has
a
lot
more
cherry
the
wood
is
still
present
light
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
with
strong
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
cherries
run
through
the
back
fairly
tart
and
sour
light
notes
of
brett
underneath
nicely
done
really
like
this
brewery
o
i
like
this
barrel
forward
vanilla
bourbon
brew
its
dry
tart
and
refreshing
while
still
being
mind
boggling
yet
strangely
familiar
worth
a
try
especially
for
yall
yay
area
brew
fan
boys
like
my
self
overall
a
tasty
sour
with
big
lactic
presence
fruity
but
not
very
definitive
if
the
sourness
was
toned
down
a
bit
you
would
get
more
of
the
fruits
i
like
this
plenty
but
i
enjoyed
brandy
peche
more
farmers
reserve
3
would
come
next
followed
by
this
here
nicely
crafted
sours
coming
out
of
almanac
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
with
malt
cherry
apricot
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
apricot
and
white
wine
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
quite
tasty
with
its
sour
fruit
and
wine
combination
this
is
a
wow
beer
the
dynamic
of
the
fruit
sourness
and
wine
barrels
is
captivating
and
lively
very
clean
features
the
fruit
without
the
funk
almanac
sours
do
have
a
brand
of
tartness
about
them
likely
due
to
use
of
the
same
bacteria
and
yeast
strains
but
this
one
is
especially
flavorful
in
comparison
o
refreshing
and
well
done
light
body
and
mildly
carbonated
the
diacetyl
knocks
the
flavor
down
a
few
notches
unfortunately
a
fruit
forward
sour
that
pairs
well
with
food
this
may
be
the
best
sour
i
have
had
to
date
i
definitely
pickup
the
cherry
the
wine
barrel
aging
gives
it
a
wine
like
character
carbonation
is
very
fine
like
a
bubbly
white
wine
the
sour
is
not
over
powering
but
definitely
there
this
is
perfect
for
a
lazy
afternoon
drink
need
to
rush
out
and
pickup
a
couple
more
bottles
jd
its
a
little
too
lemony
for
my
taste
but
this
is
a
nice
sour
true
sour
heads
should
enjoy
this
one
actually
i
think
i
might
prefer
this
over
rr
beat
cause
its
got
a
bit
more
layers
of
complexity
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
and
am
looking
forward
to
getting
a
couple
more
definitely
sour
had
it
back
to
back
with
the
sourdough
ale
and
this
one
prevailed
victorious
by
a
long
shot
in
my
opinion
thanks
almanac
for
this
awesome
beer
it
was
similar
to
anderson
valleys
rosy
barl
to
me
next
up
the
bourbon
sour
porter
should
be
great
really
delicious
its
extremely
tart
but
the
cherries
come
through
on
the
backend
and
this
is
very
drinkable
one
of
a
large
number
of
samples
i
had
at
the
extreme
beer
fest
in
boston
32132014
great
sour
and
cherry
flavors
excellent
mouth
puckering
sour
with
an
awesome
cherry
aroma
not
picking
up
much
of
the
wine
barrel
aging
just
some
hints
of
must
in
the
nose
delicious
malty
backbone
and
very
subtle
oak
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
smooth
and
thin
feeling
with
very
mild
carbonation
that
is
a
little
fizzy
on
the
tongue
and
fades
off
sweet
and
sour
a
really
enjoyable
beer
overall
and
one
i
will
definitely
have
again
wow
sooooouuuurrrrr
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
o
this
is
a
good
example
of
how
some
us
breweries
are
bring
it
now
very
close
to
their
belgian
forefathers
this
is
a
topnotch
kriek
hands
down
im
big
on
this
beer
it
has
a
lowcoarse
carb
feel
but
the
texture
and
flavors
balance
that
out
to
create
something
very
similar
to
gi
loloita
i
will
search
this
out
again
o
pretty
good
wild
not
one
that
ranks
among
the
best
but
its
very
tasty
in
its
own
right
it
has
that
house
yeast
flavour
but
at
the
same
time
its
a
bit
more
complex
than
their
usual
offerings
its
a
poor
mans
consecration
i
think
less
complexity
and
more
tartness
beautiful
reddish
hue
not
really
much
head
to
the
beer
kind
of
a
funky
aroma
maybe
a
little
sulfur
not
the
best
of
aromas
but
as
the
head
dissipates
there
is
a
tart
red
wine
aroma
with
some
subtle
sweetness
too
it
very
lip
puckering
sour
tart
cherry
flavor
nice
and
dry
very
light
on
the
tongue
the
puckering
sour
goes
away
and
mellows
out
as
glass
becomes
half
empty
but
still
just
sour
cherry
on
the
flavor
thats
it
i
dont
get
any
of
the
wine
barrel
on
the
flavor
just
the
aroma
orangebrown
translucent
really
nice
nose
tart
fruit
soft
acidic
finish
really
pleasant
finish
nice
overall
great
nose
weird
color
but
you
can
taste
the
cherries
overall
very
solid
sour
i
would
definitely
seek
this
on
out
in
the
future
o
not
bad
had
a
belgian
flanders
red
ale
that
was
really
good
this
didnt
measure
up
i
was
expecting
more
cherries
since
they
were
added
did
not
pick
them
up
will
try
more
almanac
sours
in
the
future
batch
no
3
another
great
sour
from
almanac
overall
a
decent
but
fairly
one
dimensional
sour
not
among
the
best
almanacs
i
have
sampled
the
taste
of
this
beer
missed
for
me
seemed
a
bit
flat
and
not
very
sour
really
good
sour
in
the
rr
consecration
mold
only
slightly
less
tasty
rusted
gold
outer
lining
of
fine
white

tart
cherries
no
funk
muted
vanilla
smooth
malty
sourness
very
approachable
after
this
beer
and
bourbon
sour
porter
i
am
extremely
impressed
by
the
sour
ales
brewed
by
these
guys
delicious
job
overall
very
tart
and
acidic
cherry
sour
not
as
good
as
i
remember
from
on
tap
8
oz
draft
fine
wild
ale
this
is
a
fun
beer
quite
assertively
sour
cherries
are
present
but
dont
become
overwhelming
really
nice
american
sour
definitely
could
taste
the
cherries
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
is
super
sour
very
good
and
very
mouth
puckering
more
complexity
and
sourness
in
the
taste
if
you
like
big
sours
definitely
worth
checking
out
375ml
poured
into
a
snifter
the
brew
appears
a
beautiful
clear
orange
color
with
a
white
fizzy
cap
the
smell
is
mildly
bretty
and
vinous
with
some
oaky
barrel
and
cherry
skinpits
the
taste
is
all
the
same
with
some
alcohol
warmth
and
slight
herbal
bitterness
this
is
medium
bodied
effervescent
carbonation
and
overall
real
nice
stuff
tmo
the
sour
slaps
you
in
the
face
gives
your
mouth
a
quick
tight
pucker
and
then
settles
into
that
lush
cherry
found
in
the
nose
super
solid
brew
feel
is
a
bit
fizzy
and
prickly
and
there
is
a
definite
i
am
gonna
need
tums
to
the
sourness
but
dat
cherry
worth
checking
out
for
sure
puckering
sourness
short
finish
decent
cherry
flavor
with
only
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
is
delicious
taste
was
also
puckeringly
sour
maybe
an
810
on
my
sourness
scale
indistinct
fruit
in
the
background
very
citric
and
sour
upfront
short
lived
in
the
finish
spritzy
and
medium
bodied
it
was
pretty
good
though
not
something
id
probably
get
again
needs
more
nuance
and
fruit
character
edit
nice
red
color
in
lower
light
more
goodness
from
almanac
i
like
this
better
than
the
other
fruited
variants
of
it
its
gritty
in
texture
almost
dirty
earthy
dense
and
just
a
little
pink
its
sour
beer
first
fruity
second
with
the
cherry
putting
in
about
as
much
as
the
red
wine
barrel
really
cool
wild
sourness
lacto
maturity
and
a
lot
of
malt
character
in
this
wheaty
and
a
hint
sweet
cherry
is
just
in
the
finish
and
the
red
wine
tannins
exacerbate
the
dry
pucker
acidity
is
high
oak
character
is
prominent
and
the
overall
quality
of
this
is
enormous
rad
to
have
it
on
tap
too
thanks
to
hops
and
pie
for
that
more
bubbles
would
make
it
feel
perfect
but
i
like
the
light
prickly
and
dry
density
world
class
no
doubt
amazing
to
me
that
this
and
the
cerise
sour
are
both
cherries
in
red
wine
but
this
is
such
a
flavorful
and
honestly
superior
use
of
those
ingredients
comparatively
its
really
excellent
4

a
total
3950
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
sour
most
of
the
elements
are
if
not
subtle
then
employed
with
a
sophisticated
restraint
very
nice
very
tart
and
sour
upfront
once
you
get
past
that
some
sweet
cheery
and
bready
yeasty
flavors
come
through
there
are
some
red
wine
properties
just
shy
of
and
in
the
finish
i
get
a
slight
vinegar
backbone
that
is
present
throughout
from
start
to
finish
ive
had
few
sours
such
as
consecration
by
rr
on
tap
but
definitely
not
a
sour
expert
looking
for
that
one
that
will
convert
me
to
the
sour
side
unfortunately
this
isnt
it
good
brew
complex
respect
just
not
for
me
a
clear
copper
brew
nose
is
subtle
but
the
flavor
is
incredibly
tart
acidic
and
delicious
notes
of
tart
cherry
oak
plastic
and
vinegar
the
sour
never
really
lets
up
feel
carries
the
flavor
perfectly
aggressive
crisp
and
finishes
puckering
certainly
worth
having
okay
its
not
that
bad
but
it
may
be
the
most
sour
beer
i
have
ever
had
since
almanac
is
saying
this
a
flanders
red
i
have
to
say
ti
does
not
stack
up
favorably
in
either
flavor
or
price
to
the
reigning
kings
of
the
style
o
my
teeth
hurt
from
this
sour
monster
the
beer
pours
a
tarnished
copper
color
with
a
dense
population
of
floating
particulates
and
no
head
after
settling
the
nose
is
funky
cherries
carried
by
some
syrupy
sweetness
grain
and
a
hint
of
ethanol
the
taste
is
aggressively
tart
cherries
upfront
followed
by
chewy
yeast
and
lingering
malt
and
cherries
in
the
finish
this
is
a
potent
sour
that
finishes
with
bone
dry
cherrylime
acidity
minimal
acetone
modest
complexity
chewy
yeast
negligible
carbonation
and
a
distinct
cherry
presence
throughout
although
this
is
not
my
favorite
almanac
its
still
a
great
sour
that
doesnt
disappoint
375ml
bottle
purchased
for
10
99
which
was
a
little
pricey
for
a
brewery
im
not
familiar
with
light
orange
color
no
head
really
aroma
is
the
mildest
hint
of
strawberries
nothing
like
an
oudbeitje
touch
of
malt
and
and
brett
flavor
was
easily
identified
as
a
wild
ale
but
the
strawberries
just
were
not
there
for
me
overall
it
felt
overpriced
for
the
quality
and
not
much
better
than
the
farmers
reserve
blackberry
overall
really
nice
flanders
style
ale
cherry
is
awesome
in
this
beer
o
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
and
sweet
not
the
most
complex
but
extremely
enjoyable
o
very
acidic
and
oaky
light
on
the
fruit
as
great
as
the
nose
is
the
palate
is
better
bursting
with
juice
fleshy
sweet
and
sour
cherries
cherry
skin
tannins
and
a
wonderfully
complementary
red
wine
vinegar
note
this
is
brilliant
stuff
the
mid
palate
brings
in
flavors
of
honey
a
little
sugar
vanilla
and
oak
the
funk
is
moderate
and
similar
in
character
to
the
other
almanac
sours
ive
had
earthy
damp
hay
but
this
time
around
the
fruit
character
dominates
it
easily
there
is
also
that
characteristic
malt
flavor
rustic
earthy
mildly
oxidized
even
but
it
is
not
particularly
intrusive
on
the
palate
medium
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
finishes
long
juicy
tart
and
refreshing
highly
recommended
overall
crazy
but
great
so
much
acidity
with
different
acids
great
cherry
but
very
very
little
wine
barrel
gotta
remember
to
take
my
tums
i
do
wish
the
barrel
notes
were
a
bit
bigger
o
wow
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
but
in
a
good
way
poured
very
nicely
looked
great
smelled
very
strongly
of
lactic
acid
with
cherry
and
hints
of
barrel
and
then
the
taste
comes
through
with
this
impressive
wave
of
apple
cider
great
flavor
profile
so
much
going
on
here
not
unbalanced
cant
really
find
the
barrel
in
the
flavor
because
the
combination
of
yeasts
and
bacterium
develop
so
many
individual
flavors
this
is
impressive
great
brew
thanks
for
sharing
good
but
not
one
id
have
regularly
overall
an
amazing
beer
one
of
my
new
favorite
sours
this
will
knock
the
enamel
off
your
teeth
great
cherry
fruit
with
a
solid
sour
aspect
worth
seeking

sticks
around
for
a
bit
scent
is
probably
the
most
funky
of
all
of
the
almanac
farm
to
barrel
beers
lots
of
funk
with
sour
cherry
skin
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
vinegar
but
mostly
some
musky
funky
cherry
aromas
great
nose
on
this
one
taste
is
just
as
good
the
funk
lives
on
through
the
flavor
barnyard
wheat
and
hay
with
sour
winelike
flavors
lots
of
sour
cherry
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
juicy
with
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
batch
is
better
than
i
remembered
from
batch
1
the
cherries
seem
to
be
more
complementary
to
the
beer
and
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
sour
glad
i
bought
a
few
of
these
pours
a
cloudy
brown
hued
amber
nose
is
a
biting
funky
thing
the
flavor
on
this
is
superb
i
started
going
for
a
sip
which
turned
into
more
and
then
some
more
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
yet
it
has
the
earthy
funk
mild
old
fruits
and
lactic
on
the
back
and
no
short
supply
of
it
either
this
is
well
done
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
as
some
of
the
others
of
this
series
have
been
but
who
cares
i
could
drink
a
gallon
of
this
o
very
sour
and
refreshing
yet
lacks
the
wood
character
complexity
and
funk
which
make
for
a
more
interesting
brew
o
good
level
of
sourness
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
could
definitely
go
for
more
overall
a
solid
straightforward
sour
ale
similar
to
a
flanders
oud
bruin
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
as
a
whole
it
was
a
new
experience
that
left
me
wanting
more
pour
is
a
murky
deep
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
has
a
bit
of
wood
dusty
with
a
hint
of
mushroom
and
a
light
cherry
very
sour
a
bit
acetic
strong
carbonation
and
a
light
body
dusty
brett
and
faint
mushroom
funk
with
some
tart
unripened
cherry
assertive
sourness
and
some
acetic
acid
in
the
finish
but
not
much
very
prominent
and
enjoyable
stonefruit
notes
e
g
plum
maybe
just
a
bit
of
brett
funk
on
the
nose
but
not
much
if
any
in
the
taste
easy
to
drink
not
overly
complex
for
a
sour
beer
but
quite
nice
once
you
get
past
the
initial
lippuckering
tartness
this
becomes
a
refreshing
and
tasty
american
wild
ale
t
opens
tart
with
lemon
white
wine
and
rolling
waves
of
tart
red
cherry
over
the
palate
slight
bit
of
oak
lemon
seed
and
pink
grapefruit
a
long
lingering
tartness
lasts
forever
i
like
this
a
lot
lighter
mouthfeel
dry
finish
low
carbonation
taste
had
tart
cherries
up
front
with
some
sweetness
and
funk
after
the
flavor
was
nothing
like
the
smell
very
good
sour
very
alike
to
the
other
recent
releases
as
much
as
i
love
sour
ales
this
one
may
be
a
little
too
tart
the
cherry
flavors
are
lovely
and
the
subtle
apple
tones
come
out
if
you
slurp
it
it
is
a
perfectly
dry
beer
the
smell
is
very
enticing
this
is
a
bold
and
interesting
american
sour
ale
o
tasty
and
definitely
nails
the
mark
with
big
tart
cherry
flavor
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
the
wine
barrel
character
was
only
a
bit
player
in
this
show
but
still
very
tasty
recommended
o
overall
this
beer
is
exceptional
its
hellactiously
sour
but
the
flavors
of
the
beer
do
manage
to
poke
through
othe
balance
was
rather
good
a
solid
sour
it
could
have
used
more
complexity
but
the
flavors
that
were
there
were
good
and
balanced
together
o
overall
this
was
a
solid
wild
ale
quite
sour
wish
there
was
more
sour
cherry
notes
in
this
though
bottle
from
george
thanks
buddy
pours
a
murky
redorange
color
with
very
little
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
pretty
quickly
bit
sour
vinegar
aroma
with
lots
of
sweet
cherries
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
nice
nose
on
this
flavor
is
a
nice
sweet
and
sour
cherry
some
yeast
funk
lacto
pretty
expected
for
the
style
but
with
a
bit
more
sharp
tartness
to
go
along
that
makes
it
nicely
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
more
body
than
other
sours
and
with
carbonation
on
the
lower
sidejust
a
little
prickle
overall
this
was
enjoyable
in
the
vein
of
supplication
but
quite
far
from
that
level
i
like
rainier
cherries
but
they
are
far
from
the
most
flavorful
and
seem
like
a
poor
choice
to
incorporate
in
a
beer
so
its
no
surprise
that
the
cherry
billing
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
moderate
tartness
lots
of
vinous
notes
wood
sugars
good
but
not
great
and
not
on
the
same
level
as
the
other
wild
ales
ive
had
from
almanac
o
nice
but
not
great
somewhat
disappointing
if
it
was
any
other
brewery
i
wouldnt
be
but
as
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
hold
almanac
to
a
higher
standard
m
medium
body
dry
moderate
carbonation
d
i
could
easily
have
2
or
3
of
these
the
abv
is
there
but
superbly
balanced
this
ought
to
be
on
your
sour
radar
overall
after
having
3
different
almanac
sours
it
seems
like
almanacs
calling
card
in
sour
beers
is
a
subtle
wine
barrel
notes
with
fantastic
balance
of
the
fruits
used
in
the
sour
it
has
been
unmistakable
in
all
three
of
the
almanac
sours
that
i
have
sampled
thus
far
i
enjoy
the
uniqueness
of
the
almanac
brand
sour
beers
they
may
not
be
as
high
end
as
cantillion
or
drie
fontenien
but
they
are
biting
at
the
heels
of
these
breweries
overall
really
nice
the
individual
elements
dont
stick
out
so
much
as
combine
to
something
well
constructed
its
an
enjoyable
beer
in
a
less
common
style
thats
very
drinkable
and
doesnt
go
over
the
top
o
a
really
good
sour
easy
to
drink
not
sure
if
i
would
want
to
pay
11
for
a
12oz
bottle
again
when
i
can
buy
a
fantastic
22oz
stout
or
ipa
at
79
but
if
i
can
find
it
under
10
i
will
definitely
pick
up
more
highly
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
the
beer
appears
orange
and
hazy
with
a
quarter
inch
or
so
of
offwhite
head
my
wifes
is
significantly
redder
and
darker
the
aroma
brings
wine
barrels
oak
cherries
yeast
farmhouse
funk
lovely
flavor
with
wine
character
leading
the
way
prominent
cherries
with
cherry
juice
and
oak
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
mild
puckering
finish
terrific
i
would
really
like
to
have
this
again
o
i
am
quite
impressed
this
is
a
lot
like
a
slightly
muted
supplication
to
me
id
be
interested
to
have
the
two
sidebyside
0
outstanding
beer
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
regularly
if
it
was
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
0
outstanding
beer
in
the
world
of
sours
theres
so
much
to
explore
that
i
would
imagine
trying
others
before
diving
back
into
this
one
but
a
great
beer
i
would
buy
again
and
enjoy
pretty
much
all
one
wants
to
ask
for
in
a
sour
spunky
like
buffy
the
vampire
slayer
yet
subtle
like
grace
kelly
during
her
princess
days
raul
likes
it
raul
likes
it
a
lot
but
it
is
also
so
amazingly
average
at
the
same
time
if
that
makes
sense
that
raul
wouldnt
mind
trying
something
else
if
he
had
other
options
overall
the
only
thing
that
you
can
knock
this
beer
is
the
clarity
both
in
bottles
and
on
tap
it
was
very
hazy
otherwise
it
was
my
favorite
sour
by
them
besides
farmers
reserve
number
two
it
had
a
nice
lacto
sourness
accentuated
by
the
cherries
and
then
balanced
out
with
oak
almanac
is
doing
things
right
for
sure
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
grain
red
wine
wood
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
earthy
sour
cherry
and
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
better
sour
fruit
smell
in
the
aroma
in
my
opinion
o
one
of
the
better
sours
i
have
tried
not
a
mouthpuckerer
but
has
a
nice
tart
hit
for
sure
well
balanced
flavors
and
surprisingly
easy
drinking
for
a
sour
i
will
continue
to
keep
my
eye
out
for
these
sour
releases
from
almanac
these
have
the
potential
to
get
better
and
better
and
these
recent
wild
ales
from
them
that
ive
had
have
been
really
delightful
even
though
theres
less
cherries
than
desired
the
sour
flavors
of
this
beer
are
good
enough
to
merit
a
visit
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
golden
edges
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
sour
tart
wheat
sourdough
a
touch
of
cherry
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
it
seems
a
bit
muted
some
caramel
sweetness
the
finish
is
shortlived
not
much
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
the
more
i
drink
the
less
i
think
of
this
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
but
really
falls
short
of
my
expectations
tried
this
along
with
red
poppy
and
supplication
the
dogpatch
sour
was
the
unanimous
loser
in
the
tasting
again
its
a
good
beer
but
there
are
many
better
options
out
there
a
bottle
poured
into
duvel
tulip
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
tan
head
aroma
is
part
tart
and
part
sweet
lactic
acid
underripe
cherries
and
slight
vinegar
for
the
tartness
and
butter
honey
and
melon
for
the
sweetness
flavor
has
a
unique
but
slightly
understated
rainier
cherry
character
sweet
and
fleshy
but
very
obviously
not
black
or
maraschino
cherry
like
many
other
flemishstyle
sours
have
theres
a
significant
oaky
buttery
note
throughout
but
it
isnt
really
offputting
it
lends
a
honeycomb
aftertaste
that
competes
with
cherry
pits
and
fermented
strawberries
in
the
finish
im
also
getting
a
sort
of
milky
lactose
mouthfeel
with
a
drying
sensation
like
if
youve
ever
added
honey
and
milk
to
a
cup
of
tea
i
like
this
beer
more
and
more
as
i
go
along
overall
a
unique
mix
of
lactic
acid
and
lactose
notes
with
a
moderate
amount
of
fruitiness
jd
o
the
comparisons
to
supplication
are
inevitable
unfortunately
this
beer
isnt
in
the
same
league
that
being
said
this
is
a
delicious
sour
and
really
refreshing
for
me
not
as
impressive
as
3
or
4
another
really
fantastic
sour
from
almanac
though
not
particularly
attractive
the
aroma
and
flavor
make
up
for
it
in
spades
huge
notes
of
cherry
fruit
roll
up
wine
notes
oak
and
a
bit
of
sourdough
yeast
character
come
through
nicely
the
wine
character
is
quite
pronounced
in
the
flavor
especially
as
the
beer
warms
ive
been
wildly
impressed
with
most
everything
ive
had
from
almanacs
sour
lineup
and
this
one
is
fantastic
as
well
light
body
with
some
decent
carbonation
tickling
the
tongue
a
decent
beer
but
the
flavor
on
the
tongue
was
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
a
tulip
is
ideal
o
potential
for
cellaring
is
good
to
see
how
the
funk
might
evolve
cherry
flavor
component
is
already
fairly
light
so
additional
aging
may
not
have
much
impact
nice
fresh
solid
but
i
feel
reserve
3
and
4
are
superior
ovisible
yeast
in
bottom
of
bottle
makes
me
believe
this
will
develop
more
complexity
and
funk
in
the
next
few
years
definitely
worth
picking
up
for
now
and
aging
delicious
tied
w
4
for
personal
favorite
almanac
i
know
many
prefer
3
though
not
sure
which
wine
barrel
this
was
aged
in
i
want
to
say
white
one
friend
said
it
had
an
aroma
similar
to
supplication
which
i
caught
a
whiff
of
but
i
got
the
sense
instead
of
pinot
noir
barrels
like
supp
it
was
aged
in
a
white
varietal
i
could
be
wrong
though
this
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
nice
stuff
with
lots
barrel
flavor
to
balance
the
tartness
i
would
drink
this
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
tell
by
the
way
it
is
that
people
that
like
sours
would
only
dream
of
bathing
in
this
sweet
nectar
not
one
of
odells
better
attempts
and
there
are
way
better
american
wild
ales
out
there
a
miss
from
an
all
around
great
brewery
for
me
a
friek
is
a
clever
beer
a
mix
of
cherries
and
raspberries
added
at
differetn
stages
of
the
brewing
and
barrel
aging
process
it
is
complex
and
unique
delicious
and
drinkable
and
a
great
expression
of
both
fruits
thin
reddish
in
color
purple
and
mahogany
undertones
and
just
a
mild
off
white
patchy
layer
of
bubbles
on
top
the
nose
is
more
cherry
than
raspberry
a
touch
medicinal
perhaps
but
the
sourness
in
it
brings
it
right
back
the
raspberry
adds
some
tartness
while
an
unexplained
lemon
citrus
component
is
also
there
the
flavor
i
think
balanced
both
fruits
well
but
the
raspberry
seems
like
fresh
berries
while
the
cherries
seems
more
of
a
candy
thing
maybe
to
do
with
when
they
were
added
and
how
long
residual
yeasts
have
been
working
on
them
not
overly
sour
in
taste
but
there
is
definitely
a
lambicesque
mix
of
yeast
and
bacterial
character
between
lacto
acidity
and
bretty
funk
it
fits
the
bill
pretty
well
although
brett
is
not
readily
apparent
here
some
other
yeasts
may
be
acting
similarly
upon
it
fruit
is
forward
but
its
beer
first
which
i
appreciate
but
to
me
the
body
is
too
thin
for
all
the
flavor
carbonation
could
be
ramped
up
a
bit
and
the
watered
down
fruit
syrup
texture
needs
a
lift
either
more
grain
body
or
less
leftover
sugar
its
a
tricky
balance
in
a
beer
like
this
and
its
not
quite
reached
overall
though
this
is
amazing
beer
maybe
the
best
balance
of
the
two
fruits
ive
encountered
its
another
gem
from
odell
o
a
clean
and
easy
fruit
sour
fruitoak
flavors
complement
each
other
rather
than
overpower
thanks
again

a
nice
fruity
sour
with
oak
and
yeast
drying
out
the
sweetness
and
adding
depth
i
will
pick
up
several
of
these
the
next
time
i
see
them
plenty
of
fruitiness
with
the
raspberries
and
cherries
oak
and
a
light
mustiness
lots
of
carbonation
and
a

the

is
lovely
and
the
feel
is
topnotch
15
for
750
ml
bottle
o
a
very
good
kriek
like
beer
that
i
found
very
enjoyable
i
thought
it
was
perfect
for
my
new
years
champagne
d
excellent
drinkability
and
sessionability
a
solid
brew
but
not
superb
another
nice
offering
from
odell
definitely
a
wild
one
crazy
tart
almost
vinuous
at
times
nothing
too
strange
going
on
however
id
almost
call
it
classically
wild
raspberry
flavor
mostly
gets
lost
in
the
mix
a
nifty
beer
that
sour
fans
should
experience
at
least
once
but
perhaps
too
aggressively
tart
for
many
palates
i
generally
go
for
more
sweet
with
my
sour
but
friek
is
so
well
done
ill
make
an
annual
exception
to
check
it
out
again
anytime
i
find
it
overall
this
is
a
tasty
light
fruity
beer
however
the
price
is
absurd
17
62
for
750
and
the
barrel
aging
which
increases
the
price
doesnt
seem
to
add
much
o
i
like
this
a
lot
it
has
a
very
fruitforward
flavor
not
too
sweet
though
but
is
balanced
nicely
by
its
sourness
it
certainly
wont
make
you
pucker
compared
to
other
sours
that
ive
tried
this
is
much
less
funky
and
would
be
a
good
choice
for
someone
interested
in
trying
wild
ales
well
worth
its
1214
price
tag
pours
bright
translucent
red
with
a
slight
amber
hue
the
deeper
into
the
drink
you
get
minimal
off
white
head
that
recedes
to
the
sides
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
sides
aroma
offers
a
little
funkiness
the
raspberries
are
stronger
while
its
colder
and
cherries
become
a
little
stronger
as
it
warms
the
fruits
give
offsome
sweetness
and
tartness
theres
some
vinegar
hanging
out
as
well
some
funk
and
oak
flavor
pretty
much
follows
suit
pleasantly
moderately
sour
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
great
beer
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
so
i
could
buy
another
bottle
or
2
2012
version
on
tap
at
bulldoguptown
like
most
lambic
a
this
isnt
much
to
look
at
light
pink
and
quite
clear
served
with
no
head
smells
like
a
kriek
and
that
is
a
complement
aromas
of
cherries
and
musty
funk
tastes
like
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
lactic
and
acetic
sourness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
refreshing
for
a
sour
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
lambic
style
beers
out
there
has
that
belgian
funk
tart
and
refreshing
overall
pretty
damn
decent
for
an
american
lambic
i
would
definitly
drink
this
again
but
i
seem
to
remember
it
being
quite
expensive
if
thats
the
case
ill
stick
to
the
real
belgians
well
done
and
thats
after
it
had
lost
its
pizzazz
the
medium
body
swells
nicely
and
its
a
pretty
dry
beer
overall
crispness
is
big
without
biting
too
hard
overall
decent
sour
this
bottle
might
be
old
for
the
record
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
americanmade
kriek
style
beers
ive
had
although
ive
admittedly
had
only
a
small
sampling
but
this
could
stand
up
to
any
wellmade
belgian
kriek
not
saying
it
tastes
the
same
as
some
of
the
greats
but
it
would
hold
its
own
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
even
though
the
cherry
is
subtle
i
still
really
like
it
its
piquant
yet
notoverdone
sourness
also
makes
it
easy
to
quaff
recommended
poured
a
gorgeous
ruby
red
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
lovely
to
behold
scents
of
barnyard
funk
slight
cherry
and
slight
raspberry
and
hints
of
oak
flavors
of
strong
sour
lambic
some
sour
raspberry
notes
slight
hint
of
sour
cherry
and
oak
on
the
finish
very
complex
the
fruit
flavors
have
blended
together
with
time
and
sour
brett
character
has
increased
the
oak
from
the
barrel
aging
remains
and
is
quite
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
true
to
style
for
a
belgian
sour
an
excellent
sour
with
a
good
deal
of
complexity
and
excellent
flavors
added
by
the
oak
aging
well
worth
the
18
price
tag
o
a
very
well
crafted
and
tasty
beer
fantastic
complexity
and
oh
so
good
the
sourness
is
there
without
being
overbearing
and
the
fruit
flavors
are
nice
without
being
overpowering
o
this
is
a
solid
sour
it
is
really
fruity
and
juicy
while
maintaining
a
nice
sour
flavor
though
i
wish
it
was
more
powerful
or
tart
this
was
the
first
ive
tried
from
odells
and
im
impressedwill
be
back
i
wish
i
was
able
to
get
two
bottles
so
i
could
taste
it
in
a
few
years
but
nonetheless
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
standout
sample
of
the
style
that
i
really
enjoyed
loads
of
flavour
and
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
with
the
fruit
notes
coming
through
on
the
finish
making
for
a
memorable
brew
highly
recommended
and
really
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
friek
is
a
fruitforward
sour
ale
that
supresses
the
more
earthy
or
funky
aromas
and
taste
in
order
to
allow
the
dry
and
tart
fruit
to
become
the
showcase
i
rather
like
the
beer
as
its
balance
begins
to
tilt
to
the
world
of
fruit
beers
as
much
as
it
does
wild
ale
overall
meh
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
was
left
slightly
disappointed
i
feel
like
this
is
a
beer
that
is
almost
really
good
but
none
of
the
flavors
really
want
to
stand
out
at
the
price
its
hard
to
say
if
ill
get
another
bottle
o
not
extremely
puckering
but
a
good
sour
imo
the
cherry
kriek
side
is
nice
and
though
id
like
more
raspberries
the
fruit
component
is
nice
o
good
beer
wish
it
was
a
little
less
sweet
and
a
little
more
sour
worth
trying
even
at
the
higher
price
tag
decent
but
i
came
away
disappointed
due
to
the
strange
cheese
aroma
othis
2012
batch
was
my
first
friek
and
although
the
cheesy
funky
smell
initially
turned
me
off
the
pleasant
taste
or
tart
red
fruit
and
mild
oak
grew
on
me
i
also
liked
the
dry
crisp
mouthfeel
and
finish
still
the
cheesy
nose
never
completely
disappeared
and
this
brew
lacked
the
complexity
of
a
true
lambic
both
factors
that
drop
this
beer
a
couple
spots
in
my
scoring
o
dry
and
fruity
without
being
overly
sweet
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
lower
side
of
carbonation
finishes
on
a
nice
dry
puckering
note
m
light
to
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
o
710
sourness
really
enjoyed
this
sour
has
very
nice
tartsour
flavors
complemented
with
some
fruit
flavors
from
the
raspberries
and
cherries
pretty
average
flavors
work
for
the
style
i
suppose
o
amazing
sour
ale
that
sets
a
nice
standard
for
depth
of
flavors
and
drinkability
o
pretty
straightforward
the
beer
turned
out
like
i
was
expecting
it
too
tastes
and
drinks
like
a
fruit
lambic
nothing
that
is
going
to
blow
you
away
but
a
solid
well
done
sour
wish
i
had
two
to
see
if
age
changes
the
friek
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
head
that
disappears
with
fizzy
noise
nose
is
sweet
cherries
and
some
raspberry
mixed
in
with
some
subtle
citrus
lambic
notes
taste
starts
with
lemon
sour
notes
that
is
quickly
replaced
by
some
soft
raspberries
and
cherries
whats
enjoyable
about
this
is
that
the
raspberry
cuts
into
the
cherry
and
prevents
this
beer
from
being
overly
sweet
like
some
krieks
fall
prone
to
being
mouth
is
a
little
watery
but
decent
overall
this
is
enjoyable
kriek
i
like
the
raspberry
addition
to
the
beer
this
is
the
best
sour
i
have
has
from
odell
o
love
it
cherries
raspberries
sour
oak
aged
sign
me
up
again
and
again
odells
latest
stab
at
the
sour
beer
arena
comes
at
the
palate
perhaps
too
green
and
finishes
a
bit
too
quick
but
it
did
nab
a
gold
at
the
2011
gabf
in
the
wood
barrel
aged
sour
beer
category
might
be
interesting
to
see
where
a
few
years
of
cellaring
could
take
this
brew
o
i
really
like
this
one
a
lot
i
am
new
to
the
wild
ales
and
i
am
definitely
finding
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
style
this
beer
has
some
sexiness
and
class
to
it
overall
friek
is
a
really
solid
sour
probably
one
of
the
better
shelf
sours
i
would
put
this
on
the
same
level
as
most
russian
river
sours
this
beer
doesnt
see
the
credit
or
hype
that
is
due
to
this
fruited
wild
ale
i
would
definately
more
friek
give
the
oppurtunity
thanks
to
taturbo
for
bringing
this
home
for
me
the
recent
trip
to
the
western
part
of
the
usa
md
thin
bodied
nicely
carbonated
its
not
too
overly
sour
to
be
undrinkable
and
ill
have
no
problem
polishing
off
the
bottle
o
a
nice
kriek
and
i
would
definitely
drink
another
bottle
if
i
had
one
not
sure
about
the
price
but
i
would
stock
my
fridge
with
this
one
as
my
wife
would
love
it
but
didnt
get
to
try
it
this
time
around
good
stuff
o
this
was
alright
but
the
taste
was
just
slightly
odd
compared
to
the
nose
and
the
low
carbonation
hurt
it
o
pretty
darn
fine
brew
for
a
nice
sunny
warm
day
on
the
balcony
with
the
bbq
going
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
red
with
no
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
of
sour
cherries
and
some
funky
aromas
taste
is
of
funky
and
sour
cherry
flavors
with
an
acidic
quality
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
an
extremely
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
sour
with
a
nice
cherry
presence
fizzy
near
seltzerlike
carbonation
on
a
medium
light
body
actually
aids
drinkability
overall
its
very
crisp
and
dry
refreshing
and
nicely
watching
with
spicy
foods
a
bit
pricey
could
maybe
use
just
a
wee
bit
more
sour
bite
to
clean
things
up
very
enjoyable
though
odell
friek
has
a
ton
of
flavor
with
a
great
deal
of
fruit
and
a
wealth
of
sourness
the
balance
of
fruit
and
sour
is
impressive
it
becomes
more
complex
as
it
warms
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
it
does
not
approach
the
complexity
of
some
other
sours
i
am
looking
at
you
russian
river
this
is
remarkable
nonetheless
o
was
not
expecting
this
to
be
as
good
as
it
is
although
belgian
inspired
its
also
very
belgian
in
every
aspect
the
fruit
flavor
tastes
a
bit
artificial
and
unlike
that
of
traditional
belgian
lambic
brewers
but
the
funktartoak
in
the
nose
and
taste
is
definitely
very
similar
very
drinkable
and
very
delicious
need
more
if
it
werent
so
expensive
id
probably
pick
up
some
more
overall
impression
while
ive
heard
this
wasnt
the
best
brew
i
beg
to
differ
maybe
this
years
version
is
better
than
in
the
past
im
not
sure
perfect
cherry
flavors
throughout
didnt
find
raspberries
much
in
here
but
when
the
sourness
and
cherry
characteristics
come
together
almost
everything
else
fades
i
enjoyed
this
greatly
and
recommend
getting
a
bottle
or
whatever
offering
you
can
get
it
in

awesome
i
got
to
taste
this
beer
at
savor
last
year
and
loved
it
glad
i
got
to
enjoy
some
more
meh
twice
what
id
pay
again
for
it
o
quite
good
rich
and
fruity
and
fairly
unique
as
well
im
really
enjoying
the
combination
of
fruit
flavors
this
is
somewhat
dessert
like
in
its
fruitiness
i
could
picture
this
being
made
into
an
outstanding
sorbet
but
would
definitely
be
hesitant
to
waste
a
bottle
doing
this
i
wouldnt
call
this
the
best
wild
ale
ive
ever
had
but
definitely
enjoyable

the
very
mild

something

from

develops

that
mingle

beer

dont
mind
farmhouse

and
i
love
a

the

to
be

of
earth
funk
and

as
well
really
nice

with

sweet

out

the

fun
experiment
from

great
brewery

wonderful

raspberries

fight
for
my
attention
flavors
are
a
great
blend
of
both
fruits
mildly
tart
yet
cut
with
a
sweetness
that
doesnt
come
off
cloying
at
all
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
fantastic
beer
shame
it
seems
the
bottles
vary
o
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
essentially
harmed
every
single
aspect
of
the
beer
shame
really
o
my
favorite
surprise
beer
of
2011
at
the
very
end
of
the
year
cant
recommend
enough
i
have
always
sought
out
odells
beers
and
have
usually
been
very
pleased
but
this
is
world
class
get
one
if
you
can
a
delicious
treat
truly
yum
yums
d
bravo
really
well
built
and
balanced
its
complex
without
being
overbearing
drinkable
and
delicious
id
certainly
have
this
one
again
b
overall
this
was
a
nice
spin
on
the
style
i
liked
the
mixture
of
aged
beers
and
the
carbonation
and
funkiness
produced
from
the
yeast
another
beer
that
gets
me
used
to
sours
and
wild
ales
like
them
a
lot
and
not
sure
i
can
fit
a
bottle
of
this
in
my
suitcase
to
take
back
to
boston
enjoying
what
i
cant
bring
back
while
i
am
here
in
denver
d
a
great
wild
ale
that
works
well
and
balanced
well
too
overall
just
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
very
surprised
by
the
other
reviews
on
this
one
bottle
variation
o
pretty
good
wild
ale
not
too
intense
very
approachable
and
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
with
some
nice
funk
refreshing
overall
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
just
great
i
wish
the
taste
lived
up
to
it
but
its
still
good
i
would
have
another
this
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
one
finger
head
the
smell
is
oaky
tart
and
loaded
with
cherries
and
raspberries
the
flavor
is
a
little
funky
and
tart
with
definite
cherry
and
raspberry
flavors
throughout
the
mouthfeelmwas
anoittke
thicker
than
expected
overall
a
good
beer
just
wish
it
were
a
little
more
tart
and
dryer
overall
carefully
treads
the
line
between
fruit
beer
and
american
wild
loads
of
sour
and
enough
fruit
to
keep
it
all
interesting
oak
really
shines
through
nice
depth
and
complexity
in
the
long
run
im
still
curious
about
aging
this
one
light
bodied
effervescent
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
its
very
drinkable
thanks
odell
o
redemption
finally
a
good
beer
tonight
after
two
drain
pours
i
needed
something
quite
tasty
this
was
recommended
and
didnt
disappoint
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
before
but
first
time
reviewing
it
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
consumed
fresh
the
above
review
was
of
a
new
2011
bottle
like
it
sure
its
fine
not
bad
needs
polishing
though
my
first
odell
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
its
unique
and
has
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
that
keep
your
tongue
happy
would
definitely
want
this
again
o
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
and
would
buy
it
again
overall
a
good
but
not
great
beer
good
flavors
but
nothing
extremely
great
and
the
carbonation
issue
knock
it
down
a
peg
but
would
still
try
again
o
an
awesome
brew
to
share
with
some
great
friends
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
highly
recommended
this
is
not
a
brew
for
the
extreme
fruit
lover
its
light
and
relaxed
not
aggressive
great
work
odell
brewing
body
stays
light
throughout
big
points
for
not
relying
on
added
sugar
or
at
least
it
not
tasting
that
way
the
fruit
really
comes
out
in
this
one
highly
recommended
as
i
commit
this
rating
to
the
internets
i
must
admit
shock
or
bewilderment
at
the
mere
b
this
delectable
brew
currently
holds
this
beer
is
fantastic
big
thanks
to
g311
for
the
share
the
brew
pours
a
rustic
ruby
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
filmy
pink
head
good
looking
stuff
the
aroma
is
excellent
rasperry
leads
the
way
in
the
aromatic
department
with
cherry
hiding
behind
oak
and
vanilla
notes
and
also
revealing
itself
through
the
fruity
tartness
which
hides
the
acidity
well
the
flavor
is
just
as
good
as
the
nose
but
is
apportioned
quite
differently
in
this
case
sour
cherry
is
readily
evident
paired
with
a
musty
oak
funk
the
raspberry
shows
up
on
the
finish
with
a
sort
of
clean
sweetness
the
feel
is
petillant
and
just
under
mediumbodied
overall
this
is
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
and
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
picked
this
up
recently
for
16
despite
passing
on
it
earlier
in
the
year
its
dark
purpleredburgundy
and
had
a
head
for
a
moment
then
it
disappeared
it
is
carbonated
fine
though
so
maybe
my
glass
was
dirty
smells
very
woody
like
barrels
and
a
hint
of
cherries
and
brett
taste
is
cherries
tart
raspberry
very
strong
wood
barrel
flavor
not
bad
at
all
this
really
doesnt
taste
like
lambic
to
me
but
as
an
american
wild
ale
it
works
only
problem
is
the
price
tag
the
quality
if
this
beer
does
not
justify
16
and
i
would
never
buy
it
again
a
very
nice
lambic
fruit
style
attempt
by
odell
the
mixture
of
two
fruits
adds
a
little
extra
character
its
not
quite
as
funky
as
its
belgian
brethren
but
still
quite
good
thanks
crajun
from
the
other
site
for
the
opportunity
a
nice
american
interpretation
of
the
fruit
lambic
style
very
solid
though
lacking
a
noticeable
cheesy
funk
still
pretty
good
and
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
cheers
this
is
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
calling
this
a
lambic
could
certainly
lead
one
to
be
a
bit
disappointed
though
i
certainly
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
anything
like
a
lambic
so
i
am
not
nearly
so
disappointed
as
i
would
be
i
definitely
feel
like
i
should
be
able
to
say
more
about
this
beer
than
i
am
able
it
is
certainly
a
bit
more
simplistic
than
it
should
be
the
beer
actually
has
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
the
feeble
head
would
suggest
in
some
ways
this
can
taste
a
bit
like
watered
down
cherry
raspberry
juice
though
it
is
not
quite
all
that
bad
took
forever
to
get
the
cork
out
but
when
i
did
it
poured
out
with
a
good
red
color
but
no
head
to
speak
of
one
definitely
notices
the
fruit
aroma
coming
from
it
and
they
are
also
evident
in
the
taste
which
is
nice
and
tart
finishes
with
a
little
bit
of
a
puckering
in
the
aftertaste
would
i
drink
it
again
if
someone
else
was
buying
sure
otherwise
its
a
bit
too
expensive
17750
ml
for
what
i
am
getting
for
it
o
i
need
more
of
this
for
sure
quite
excellent
well
done
odell
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
flavors
worked
well
together
and
it
never
got
to
the
point
of
being
overpowering
i
didnt
detect
much
of
the
raspberries
but
it
still
had
plenty
of
cherries
to
make
up
for
it
o
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
im
glad
i
got
to
try
a
bottle
now
and
that
i
have
one
more
to
age
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
a
year
or
more
will
do
to
this
my
first
odell
wild
ale
and
im
not
dying
to
open
the
other
ones
i
also
got
in
this
trade
definitely
a
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
compare
to
the
likes
of
supplication
like
i
was
expecting
o
solid
beer
easy
to
get
down
and
tastes
pretty
good
no
problems
drinking
and
enjoying
this
shared
this
one
with
the
group
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
rake
for
sending
me
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
ruby
red
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
and
cherry
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
cherry
and
water
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
this
one
tasted
a
little
watered
down
on
the
flavors
to
me
which
was
unfortunate
not
sure
why
this
was
the
fact
but
it
really
left
me
craving
something
more
from
it
however
the
flavors
that
were
present
were
quite
enjoyable
though
the
aroma
was
not
very
complex
but
was
pleasant
on
the
nose
though
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
to
do
so
but
not
my
favorite
offering
from
odell
thanks
to
schmittymack
for
pulling
this
one
out
last
saturday
night
poured
a
medium
reddish
color
with
a
small
dirty
white
head
nice
tart
aromas
sour
cherries
wood
light
raspberry
and
a
little
funk
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
bodied
tart
and
funky
with
early
hints
of
raspberry
followed
by
a
long
woody
cherry
finish
smells
appealing
and
tastes
decent
enough
but
this
could
really
use
a
shot
of
the
bubbly
this
is
a
lambic
that
borders
on
sour
without
being
too
sour
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshingly
so
the
fruit
works
really
well
together
and
the
barrel
aging
adds
depth
i
think
odell
did
a
really
nice
job
with
this
one
o
this
is
a
really
good
lambic
i
loved
the
blend
of
cherry
and
raspberries
o
ive
been
impressed
lately
by
odells
sours
a
solid
effort
on
their
part
i
have
another
bottle
that
im
thinking
of
hanging
on
too
interested
in
seeing
how
it
develops
as
the
fruits
fade
felt
this
was
a
very
middle
of
the
road
example
of
the
style
cherries
is
dominant
lactic
acid
is
creamy
in
the
mouth
thin
body
overall
the
finish
is
mildly
oaky
and
overall
strong
it
is
a
fruity
beer
strong
cherries
id
have
it
again
a
nice
sour
medium
bodied
but
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
with
a
very
tart
mouthpuckering
character
sour
without
being
acidic
very
dry
with
lots
of
funky
bugs
and
toasted
oak
barrel
character
this
beer
is
bursting
with
fresh
fruit
there
s
plenty
of
tart
dark
cherry
but
just
like
the
aroma
the
tart
funky
raspberries
are
more
dominant
this
adds
to
the
sour
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
while
being
sweet
and
refreshing
not
harsh
or
solvent
like
very
dry
and
tart
but
not
overly
sour
or
difficult
to
drink
this
beer
is
pretty
interesting
and
im
curious
how
it
will
hold
up
as
the
fruit
fades
rich
raspberry
taste
wraps
around
the
tongue
and
then
puckers
the
cheeks
with
the
tartness
very
nicely
done
some
subtle
apple
maybe
pear
like
flavors
dancing
around
in
the
back
now
as
well
before
really
drying
out
for
the
finish
leaving
a
long
lasting
taste
of
fruit
in
the
mount
begging
you
for
another
sip
o
solid
sour
easy
drinkability
nice
cherry
flavors
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
not
amazing
or
worth
paying
18
bucks
for
but
still
solid
beer
low
carbonation
isnt
fully
detrimental
but
also
doesnt
help
a
nice
sour
and
tart
beer
that
would
benefit
from
a
carbonation
pick
me
up
o
refreshing
tart
and
fruity
but
i
wish
there
was
carbonation
and
a
bit
more
complexity
to
this
beer
overall
nice
fruit
profile
but
not
super
complex
still
enjoyable
great
effort
from
odell
overall
an
excellent
beer
from
odell
the
fruit
has
a
stronger
presence
than
the
lambic
but
it
is
nonetheless
delicious
ive
got
one
extra
to
cellar
for
a
while
hopefully
it
will
develop
more
sourness
and
funk
as
it
ages
pours
a
cloudy
red
color
with
an
average
white
head
and
some
sparse
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
a
ton
of
cherry
aroma
along
with
a
slight
bit
of
oak
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
the
cherries
really
dominate
and
theres
a
bit
of
oak
and
light
acidity
in
the
background
light
body
with
a
dry
slightlyacidic
finish
really
nicely
done
dry
acidic
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
not
as
tart
or
acidic
as
most
sours
but
still
very
nice
a
very
nice
effort
by
odell
which
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
at
times
this
one
is
very
nice
but
its
also
very
middle
of
the
road
at
other
times
pull
out
its
high
points
and
youll
like
it
just
fine
trouble
is
its
not
all
that
unique
ultimately
good
but
forgettable
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
ruby
color
with
a
trace
of
white
bubbly
head
the
aroma
has
notes
of
raspberry
cherry
and
vinegar
the
flavor
is
like
a
warhead
candy
if
you
dont
know
what
that
means
is
has
a
very
sour
taste
to
start
with
a
fruity
flavor
afterward
in
this
case
raspberry
and
cherry
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
maybe
could
use
a
little
more
carb
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
d
this
is
pretty
good
not
sure
where
the
various
ds
are
coming
from
as
even
without
carbonation
i
can
imagine
this
would
still
be
pretty
enjoyable
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
tackled
the
750ml
on
my
own
quite
easily
i
would
pair
the
friek
with
strong
cheeses
that
would
be
awesome
d
great
drinkability
not
overly
complex
and
not
as
agressively
sour
as
many
of
its
contemporaries
but
given
odells
background
this
is
a
step
in
an
intriguing
direction
for
them
drink
this
was
a
perfect
way
to
start
a
tasting
event
it
was
light
tasty
and
sweet
not
over
done
or
underdone
and
was
pretty
tasty
appearance
is
a
mury
and
cloudy
reddish
brown
almost
copper
colored
think
like
an
old
penny
not
like
a
new
penny
head
dissipates
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
small
amount
of
bubbles
that
circle
the
glass
tart
cherry
aroma
explodes
throughout
the
aroma
with
familiar
and
yet
complex
hints
of
oak
and
sour
funk
aroma
is
definitly
a
highlight
of
the
beer
first
taste
is
sour
fruit
as
the
sour
raspberries
and
cherries
really
stand
out
as
your
palate
adjusts
you
can
start
to
pick
out
the
fruit
notes
which
really
work
well
oak
finishes
this
beer
could
use
a
little
bit
more
complexity
in
the
finish
as
it
goes
straight
from
sour
fruit
to
the
light
oak
finish
sourness
is
abrupt
at
the
beginning
but
fades
as
you
continue
to
drink
it
mouthfeel
is
very
full
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
relatively
light
this
means
the
beer
kind
of
melts
off
your
tongue
as
you
drink
it
not
sure
if
theres
such
a
thing
as
an
easy
drinking
sour
but
if
there
is
this
beer
would
likely
be
it
i
was
impressed
with
this
i
hope
odell
continues
with
lambics
o
this
was
an
experience
and
for
my
first
lambic
i
was
really
impressed
odells
is
really
onto
something
here
and
they
seem
to
consistently
produce
better
and
better
beers
they
continue
to
impress
me
overall
i
am
glad
i
traded
for
this
but
wouldnt
try
to
get
one
again
worth
the
effort
in
a
fair
trade
id
say
taste
is
really
watery
cherry
comes
through
a
bit
nice
oak
flavors
coming
through
the
sour
is
not
really
as
strong
as
the
nose
would
let
on
it
is
kind
of
disappointing
raspberries
are
faintly
present
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
was
really
interested
in
this
but
just
meh
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
american
made
fruit
lambic
i
like
the
taste
is
somewhat
pleasant
relatively
tart
cherry
up
front
with
lingering
sweetness
as
a
backbone
raspberries
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
and
it
feels
as
though
each
mouthfull
never
quite
materializes
there
is
something
incomplete
about
this
beer
and
it
was
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
definitely
worth
trying
although
the
price
tag
is
quite
steep
but
not
one
of
the
finer
examples
of
the
style
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
go
to
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
am
sure
my
wife
would
if
we
had
an
unlimited
supply
of
it
and
now
the
true
dark
lord
day
festivities
can
begin
in
earnest
the
random
group
tastings
this
product
thereof
pours
a
murky
amber
grapefruit
juice
red
o
course
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
cobwebs
oak
caramel
and
black
cherry
the
taste
holds
notes
of
sour
cherry
ruby
red
grapefruit
light
cobweb
oak
and
dank
raspberries
the
body
is
a
stoic
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
oily
feel
overall
a
solid
bit
o
lambic
something
very
akin
to
new
glarus
enigma
in
taste
though
the
occasional
pricks
of
tartness
and
cobwebs
without
some
sort
of
consistency
if
that
makes
any
sense
to
anyone
but
me
ill
be
surprised
keep
this
from
making
it
up
to
that
lofty
point
i
really
enjoyed
the
enigma
still
a
tasty
specimen
indeed
3
0
d
im
not
really
that
impressed
with
this
one
especially
given
the
high
price
tag
i
would
have
preferred
a
much
bigger
fruit
component
with
a
buggier
base
beer
probably
not
sour
enough
for
true
sour
frieks
poured
a
corked
and
caged
750ml
into
my
hennepin
globe
this
beer
pours
a
blackberry
purple
with
a
decent
2inch
bubbly
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
nothing
no
ring
no
lacing
but
not
abnormal
for
sours
the
aroma
has
a
lactic
twang
up
front
melting
into
tart
berries
both
the
cherry
and
the
raspberry
come
through
in
the
nose
along
with
a
bit
of
oak
vinegar
and
just
a
hint
of
must
the
flavor
falls
off
a
bit
while
the
fruits
are
still
there
the
tartness
isnt
as
sharp
as
it
is
in
the
aroma
the
vinegar
is
a
bit
more
vocal
with
the
must
and
oak
almost
nonexistent
as
it
warms
up
the
raspberry
comes
through
a
bit
more
and
lends
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
at
the
tail
end
of
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
great
crisply
carbonated
leaving
a
prickly
sensation
on
the
palate
finishes
extremely
dry
making
the
tongue
almost
feel
stuck
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
overall
i
thing
there
is
some
room
for
improvement
but
it
gives
me
hope
that
odells
could
become
of
the
better
and
more
consistent
sour
producers
in
the
us
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
a
murky
deep
ruby
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
form
a
tiny
collar
tart
cherry
in
the
nose
right
off
the
bat
followed
by
a
slight
funkiness
lightmedium

very

with

the
raspberry
fruit
flavors
but
then
transtions
to
a
sourtart
funkiness
not
overly
funky
but
there
i
find
myself
rather
surprised
how
well
i
like
this
beer
i
would
for
sure
drink
this
again
and
am
glad
i
have
a
second
bottle
to
cellar
o
great
brew
worth
checking
out
for
sure
at
the
price
point
you
cant
find
too
much
better
great
balance
and
easy
to
drink
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
if
i
can
find
them
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
sour
i
was
shocked
by
this
one
after
having
odells
first
sour
this
was
a
lot
better
really
drinkable
as
well
good
flavors
good
stuff
o
entirely
pleasant
not
overly
sour
not
overly
complex
not
a
top
tier
beer
but
theres
also
nothing
i
can
find
to
complain
about
o
pretty
darn
good
beer
here
not
quite
as
candylike
delicious
as
lindemans
frambois
but
it
makes
up
for
it
with
depth
and
neat
brett
funk
wish
it
were
more
affordable
as
this
is
something
i
could
enjoy
frequently
on
a
hot
afternoon
o
not
a
bad
effort
from
odell
i
have
really
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
flavors
and
a
good
intro
to
sours
for
the
uninitiated
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
to
lay
down
and
let
age
because
i
think
this
will
continue
to
get
funkier
as
it
ages
draft
at
the
brewery
taproom
the
wood
aging
adds
some
pleasant
flavor
to
this
lambic
evening
out
the
tartness
some
and
adding
complexity
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
raspberry
in
the
flavor
profile
nice
to
try
but
i
feel
a
little
cheated
by
the
18
price
tag
o
very
solid
beer
i
enjoyed
it
after
i
wrapped
my
head
around
it
i
expected
a
more
sour
beer
after
smelling
the
nose
but
this
beer
was
more
sweet
with
a
mixture
of
tartness
im
excited
to
drink
the
bottle
i
purchased
and
hope
its
similar
to
what
i
had
on
draft
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
others
who
like
creative
beer
or
softer
lambicssours
o
solid
beer
overall
could
have
used
a
little
more
tartness
but
it
was
good
this
is
another
really
nice
effort
from
odell
and
actually
one
that
may
be
worth
watching
age
for
a
year
or
so
d
great
beer
by
odells
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
by
them
while
i
expected
sweeter
fruit
and
more
sour
it
was
the
opposite
and
i
liked
it
balanced
softer
fruit
with
more
tart
notes
great
summer
beer
first
beer
or
desert
beer
i
love
the
use
of
the
barrel
on
this
beer
it
imparts
a
big
flavor
that
so
many
fruit
lambics
tend
to
ignore
the
fruity
flavors
are
a
bit
onedimensional
being
overpowered
by
raspberry
but
i
polished
off
the
whole
bottle
without
a
problem
tasty
and
easydrinking
750ml
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
red
with
full
head
aroma
has
some
cherries
and
lots
of
wood
taste
is
sour
with
some
cherry
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
woody
finish
this
is
the
most
sour
odells
as
others
have
noted
but
im
still
waiting
for
them
to
produce
a
consistently
great
sour
their
sour
old
ale
though
is
delicious
notes
friek
is
a
light
to
moderate
bodied
brew
but
flavor
is
intense
thirstquenching
is
this
beers
priority
its
tart
flavor
and
dry
finish
makes
it
a
perfect
before
or
afterdinner
sipper
or
with
a
fruity
desert
would
be
ideal
drinkability
is
impeccable
mad
props
to
odell
for
this
release
overall
a
really
nice
beer
i
judge
this
to
the
standard
of
cantillon
and
it
is
in
the
ballpark
despite
a
few
minor
flaws
cant
wait
to
begin
pimping
this
beer
out
at
my
craft
beer
store
job
on
thursday
based
on
really
liking
it
overall
very
solid
lambicstyle
ale
here
not
mind
blowing
but
nicely
balanced
light
pleasing
and
very
refreshing
another
great
job
by
odell
d
really
enjoyable
but
now
i
have
to
decide
whether
to
drink
my
bottle
now
or
hold
onto
it
and
see
what
its
like
a
year
from
now
curious
what
this
might
taste
like
with
some
age
on
it
solid
again
odells
hope
they
keep
it
up
on
all
their
new
beers
overall
a
very
nice
sour
more
sour
than
i
remember
from
other
bottles
and
on
draft
reminds
me
of
a
soured
new
glarus
fruit
beer
this
is
better
than
i
remember
their
earlier
test
versions
odell
has
been
playing
with
brett
but
this
is
the
first
sour
that
i
know
of
very
impressive
its
not
a
lambic
that
will
wow
you
with
sour
or
pucker
your
mouth
but
its
enjoyable
and
more
drinkable
for
that
reason
excellent
work
boys
keep
it
up
taste
follows
smell
pretty
closely
nice
range
of
fruits
cranberries
cherries
currants
grapes
i
dont
detect
too
much
oak
aging
perhaps
some
in
the
brief
middle
wish
there
was
more
present
malt
in
here
the
taste
needs
to
be
fleshed
out
some
its
too
thin
and
one
dimensional
on
fruit
and
the
wild
ale
sour
finish
there
is
less
dryness
in
the
finish
than
expected
d
the
tartness
sourness
and
bite
of
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
to
drink
a

light

one
of
the
better
beers
odell
has
released
well
done
odells
you
continue
to
impress
me
i
hope
you
keep
this
one
in
your
rotation
the
body
is
light
with
a
nice
acidic
taste
but
the
cherry
balances
it
out
well
and
lingers
into
the
finish
overall
pretty
tasty
but
if
i
were
to
nit
pick
i
would
say
it
could
use
some
more
complexity
still
very
tasty
and
drinkable

overall
a
really

that
demonstrates
that
a
clean
flavor
profile
complemented
by
superior
drinkability
can
really
go
a
long
way
definitely
worth
trying
one
of
the
more
overrated
beers
out

and
thank
me
later
while
my
beer
did
not
shapeshift
it
certainly
had
the
makings
to
do
so
a
flavor
extravaganza
epic
this
is
something
to
cherish
batch
7
so
happy
to
have
tried
this
one
i
swear
this
beer
morphed
into
something
different
in
my
glass
several
times
while
drinking
it
a
beautiful
beer
that
is
both
delicious
and
fun
to
drink
during
sf
beer
week
2015
trappist
provisions
in

a

event
including
a
keg
of

subdued
apricot
sour
tons
of

it

funky
with
some

very
good
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
so
much
flavor
never
a
dull
sip
throughout
the
entire
bottle
this
makes
me
want
to
try
westly
that
much
more
and
excellent
example
of
brewing
with
fruit
fully
attenuated
not
juicy
funk
and
fruit
as
well
as
anyone
like
other
fruited
sara
saisons
this
is
not
dominant
on
the
fruit
but
just
a
very
integrated
and
pretty
complex
farmhouse
ale
as
it
warms
the
apricot
comes
out
more
on
the
nose
and
the
taste
gets
more
complex

this

are
superb
a
firmer
body
would
tie
it
all
together
in
near
perfection
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
drink
this
one
and
now
know
that
sara
deserves
the
hype
a
refreshing
brew
fruited
sour
verdict
the
fruit
comes
across
superbly
well
but
the
base
beer
is
certainly
not
forgotten
complex
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
very
reminiscent
of
peche
n
brett
in
that
the
saison
qualities
are
not
lost
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
in
the
future
really
well
balanced
saison
with
just
a
hint
of
apricot
skin
on
the
finish
the
base
beer
is
so
well
made
in
terms
of
carb
as
well
as
balance
in
the
funk
and
tartness
its
a
quenching
tartness
that
highlights
the
beer
my
first
beer
from
these
folks
thats
not
a
collaboration
and
its
a
pretty
good
one
albeit
a
little
short
of
where
the
hype
would
have
it
the
apricots
didnt
seem
that
prominent
to
me
but
the
sour
saison
base
was
awesome
and
the
barrel
aspect
fantastic
hazy
orange
tinted
blonde
color
short
but
lasting
white
inch
on
top
the
nose
here
is
more
saison
yeast
than
brett
but
there
is
some
funk
intermixed
with
the
moderate
acid
tartness
the
apricots
arent
invisible
on
the
nose
but
their
presence
is
light
more
of
an
orchard
fruit
sweetness
than
apricots
specifically
but
i
get
it
the
flavor
is
light
on
the
apricot
too
which
is
fine
for
me
i
dont
reckon
it
needs
much
the
blonde
sour
saison
beer
is
just
great
with
a
lot
of
yeast
character
in
addition
to
the
mouthfeel
its
got
a
little
spice
and
the
wheat
malt
base
has
some
serious
body
to
it
the
carbonation
is
pronounced
and
the
finish
is
dry
as
an
apricot
wild
ale
its
not
my
favorite
its
not
fruit
forward
enough
for
that
but
as
a
wild
ale
in
general
its
exquisite
the
oak
on
this
adds
a
nice
layer
that
jives
famously
with
the
yeast
i
would
buy
this
if
it
were
available
here
for
sure
a
bit
too
sour
for
my
virgin
sour
tastes
but
this
still
had
a
lot
of
great
flavors
that
i
could
enjoy
overall
one
of
the
best
american
fruit
sourssaisons
ive
had
thus
far
jeez
so
much
more
delicate
yet
flavourful
than
the
likes
of
chez
monus
and
atrial
rubicite
its
up
there
with
new
glarus
very
sour
blackberry
in
terms
of
the
drinking
experience
sante
adairius
is
for
real
this
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
clear
white
foam
theres
a
crisp
lemony
floral
tartness
to
it
that
just
absolutely
snaps
the
beer
tastes
amazing
with
notes
of
lemon
and
jasmine
on
the
back
end
it
is
incredibly
delicatedare
i
say
sublimewith
a
long
tart
finish
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
orange
with
a
thin
white
tightly
knit
head
that
fades
rapidly
the
nose
is
a
distinct
shotgun
of
apricot
to
the
face
some
funk
and
and
sour
little
malt
no
bitterness
touch
of
red
wine
and
acetone
the
taste
is
also
distinctly
apricot
that
is
tart
with
just
enough
sweetness
and
has
a
lingering
dried
apricot
finish
the
beers
light
bodied
true
to
fruit
with
layered
barrel
complexities
lightmedium
carbonation

a

so

the
taste

upfront
and
all
peach
and
apricot
on
the
back
end
sticks
around
in
the
mouth
for
a
while
after
you
swallow
medium
mouthfeel
almost
no
carbonation
feels
a
bit
heavy
on
the
tongue
in
a
good
way
i
would
like
a
little
more
carbonation
but
my
bottle
may
have
been
compromised
in
the
mail
all
the
other
flavors
are
there
though
nice
level
of
tartness
here
very
refreshing
and
meshes
well
with
the
fruit
flavors
great
stuff
fairly
simple
concept
but
phat
and
delicious
overall
west
ashley
is
a
fantastic
american
wild
ale
and
was
the
perfect
beer
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
think
a
little
tweaking
of
the
funk
profile
to
limit
the
dirty
character
will
put
this
beer
on
the
map
as
one
of
the
best
american
sours
need
another
bottle

likely
best

this
is
an
amazing
beer
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
had
maybe
even
the
best
yes
i
gave
this
beer
the
elusive
5
because
i
thought
that
for
what
it
is
a
soured
fruited
wine
barrelaged
saison
it
did
what
it
was
supposed
to
flawlessly
it
skyrocketed
immediately
to
my
top
10
favorite
beers
of
all
time
and
is
worthy
of
the
hype
and
what
i
traded
for
it
a
truly
memorable
experience
a
very
good
beer
with
a
bit
too
much
sulfur
in
the
nose
hopefully
they
get
that
figured
out
its
been
present
in
some
of
their
others
beers
as
it
is
detracting
who
needs
spontaneous
fermentation
when
you
can
inoculate
with
a
house
strain
of
this
quality
im
heavily
biased
as
this
beer
opened
up
an
entirely
new
dimension
for
me
call
it
the
gateway
drug
to
sour
beer
tart
without
being
overpuckering
intense
but
not
overpowering
complex
but
not
complicated
bright
fruity
spicy
and
playful
remarkably
easy
to
drink
d
this
was
quite
enjoyable
and
perfect
for
a
hot
4th
of
july
my
first
sante
adairius
experience
that
bodes
well
for
future
offerings
id
love
to
have
this
again
and
see
if
the
wild
yeast
develops
over
time
o
loved
this
one
we
drank
a
bunch
of
other
peach
and
stone
fruit
sours
the
night
before
and
i
would
say
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
couple
bottles
of
this
one
oohhh
the
funk
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
really
nice
not
earthshattering
but
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
o
light
saison
with
a
nice
apricot
and
a
nice
hit
of
tartness
a
true
gem
here
good
but
not
sure
if
id
get
it
again

loved
it
o
a
very
polished
drinking
experience
with
an
exceptional
smoothness
per
style
acidic
nice
burst
of
sour
cherries
theres
much
to
be
said
about
the
smooth
brewed
nature
of
this
beer
crisp
sharp
in
flavor
yet
very
graceful
with
a
good
level
of
sourness
while
maintaining
optimal
drinkability
levels
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
sessionable
with
a
good
level
of
complexity
reminds
me
of
a
good
cider
im
very
impressed
by
prairies
offerings
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
and
the
flavors
evolve
and
become
better

it

the

at

there
was
no
sourness

expected
from

taste
is
close

id
recommend
this
to
any

drinker
that
wants
to
experiment
with
wild

and
funky

its
loaded
with

here
sort

like

light
bodied
at
first
but
the
cherry
comes
off
a
little
syrupy
big
carbonation
prickly
on
the
tongue
this
doesnt
taste
bad
by
any
means
but
not
prairies
best
effort
as
it
lacks
the
funk
and
other
sour
notes
one
would
expect
from
a
beer
like
this
pours
a
deep
reddish
color
with
an
off

of
sour
cherries
and
red
wine
vinegar
acetic
in
taste
with
slight
souring
tartness
and
sour

decent
strength
and
good
to
style
just
a
touch
of
sugary
malts
and
a
lemon
rind
element
with
sour
cherry
following
full
bodied
yet
crisp
and
bright
very
nice
simple
flavor
and
good
at
that
falls
a
bit
short
in
a
few
areas
but
overall
a
very
solid
and
naturaltasting
sour
pours
a
clear
pink
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
aromas
of
sour
cherry
and
a
hint
of
grain
taste
is
an
initial
light
cherry
flavor
followed
by
some
grain
then
an
acidic
funk
finishing
with
a
tart
sour
dry
earthy
flavor
mouth
feel
is
average
overall
a
good
sour
ale
this
beer
is
neither
sour
cherrylike
or
very
funky
pretty
disappointing
o
an
excellent
wildbrett
beer
great
base
flavor
profile
and
very
all
too
easy
to
drink
gorgeous
clear
pink
beer
with
about
12
of
head
on
the
pour
not
great
head
retention
beer
smells
of
must
hay
light
funk
and
a
hint
of
tart
lemons
and
cherries
on
the
palate
it
has
light
tame
funk
notes
a
bit
of
tartness
and
cherry
notes
and
surprisingly
little
else
not
much
in
the
way
of
malt
to
back
or
any
real
sourness
to
take
it
over
the
top
feel
is
light
and
effervescent
pretty
good
overall
decent
but
doesnt
have
that
extra
gear
to
make
it
truly
memorable
the
taste
has
a
very
nice
cherry
flavor
that
is
slightly
tart
with
mild
yeast
funkiness
in
the
back
with
slightly
low
malt
flavor
with
gently
alcohol
warmth
in
the
back
of
the
throat
with
a
mostly
dry
quality
with
spicy
finish
the
taste
of
the
cherry
works
well
with
the
funk
in
the
taste
wout
any
cherry
cough
syrup
type
flavor
bu
more
lemony
cherry
type
combo
in
that
it
is
tangy
and
finishes
in
a
refreshing
way
overall
excellent
cherry
beer
with
mild
funk
in
the
flavor
it
seems
to
me
like
a
beer
inspired
by
belgian
lambic
as
the
fruit
flavor
is
prominent
and
this
was
a
nice
treat
for
me
for
a
wednesday
in
the
burg
before
christmas
i
would
definitely
want
to
see
if
there
is
any
diference
in
the
bottle
version
great
cherry
taste
murky
light
brown
with
a
fingernail
of
off
white
head
covering
the
top
vibrant
carbonation
bubbles
are
present
within
aroma
is
brett
and
very
tart
cherries
the
flavor
is
brett
with
tart
cherries
at
the
back
of
the
palate
this
breaks
heavily
carbonated
and
crisp
light
cherry
wood
and
im
guessing
only
one
batch
so
at
this
point
would
expect
more
funk
lots
of
light
malty
wheat
and
pilsner
like
flavor
light
tartness
good
but
lacking
a
very
slightly
funky
version
of
maraschino
cherry
juice
finishes
clean
and
dry
its
ok
but
lacking
in
flavorfunkiness
or
tart
nice
and
refreshing
but
not
what
expected
from
these
guys
not
the
depth
of
yeast
characters
and
even
the
cherry
is
a
little
background
nothing
special
about
it
that
being
said
its
still
a
nice
sipper
yeah
not
poison
but
not
the
most
pleasant
its
tolerable
like
del
taco
when
hungover
but
all
things
considered
raul
would
not
venture
with
the
funk
again
othis
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
hunt
down
it
is
cherry
and
it
is
funky
so
you
get
what
you
pay
for
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
beer
that
blows
me
away
or
sets
it
apart
from
other
fruited
brett
beers
better
than
the
reviews
claimed
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
not
sure
if
this
bottle
was
bad
but
if
it
wasnt
it
wasnt
good
little
metallic
and
very
muted
flavors
of
cherry
or
any
funk
didnt
finish

poured

9
oz
bottle
no
idea
why
its
not
british
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
o
overall
kind
of
pricy
and
the
finish
hurts
this
beer
worth
trying
once
but
wont
seek
out
again
o
a
pretty
solid
well
made
and
flavorful
beer
not
as
overpowering
as
some
sour
beers
but
tasty
nonetheless
similar
to
petrus
lighter
and
not
as
sour
solid
not
overly
sourly
sweet
wild
cherry
candy
sours
sweet
tarts
some
bite
on
the
mouthfeel
crisp
finish
this
is
the
one
sour
where
its
vast
simplicity
is
its
glory
and
its
downfall
the
flavor
is
funky
cherry
easily
drinkable
and
easily
enjoyable
this
simplicity
helps
it
be
accessible
but
id
rather
see
a
bit
more
pucker
a
bit
more
sour
and
a
bit
more
sweet
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
very
good
but
i
feel
like
it
could
have
been
even
more
so
reading
all
the
other
reviews
this
stuff
is
a
giant
bomb
and
i
fell
for
it
too
it
was
on
my
radar
and
when
i
saw
it
i
purchased
it
its
an
overall
odd
meld
with
a
big
fruit
beer
american
character
stuck
inside
a
wild
that
seems
to
be
scrambling
to
get
out
and
show
its
character
nice
combination
but
the
marriage
needs
to
be
better
overall
a
drinkable
funky
sour
but
it
lacks
a
certain
je
ne
sais
quoi
for
me
maybe
a
more
prominent
cherry
character
or
a
cleaner
funkiness
its
hard
to
say
not
at
all
bad
but
not
mindblowing
o
disappointing
tastes
like
nothing
more
than
starndard
farmhouse
alesaison
the
cherries
is
false
advertising
the
color
is
awesome
it
really
looks
pink
as
you
pour
it
and
theres
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
so
its
not
a
total
loss
just
no
cherry
presence
at
all
overall
meh
o
for
being
a
wild
ale
this
is
pretty
tame
overall
pretty
good
with
some
nice
layered
fruit
notes
but
a
few
odd
notes
kind
of
keep
it
from
being
better
worth
trying
o
meh
perhaps
the
least
impressive
prairie
offering
to
date
save
the
disappointing
prairie
hop
i
would
not
have
again
or
recommend
o
new
to
sour
ales
with
that
said
its
not
bad
give
me
a
stout
cheers
serving
type
bottle
somebody
put
the
colors
of
tanned
orange
and
pink
flesh
together
in
one
liquid
not
much
of
a
head
or
retention
above
the
aroma
of
lemon
tartness
arises
with
an
addition
of
cherries
cherry
lemonade
anyone
this
is
especially
more
true
with
a
taste
cherry
funk
doesnt
provide
much
cherry
or
funk
when
compared
to
the
tidal
wave
of
tart
lemonade
and
more
tart
lemonade
dabs
of
cherry
and
a
vague
funkiness
dont
make
much
of
a
mark
here
its
a
singular
tart
beer
without
much
variation
and
for
that
reason
im
not
floored
by
cherry
funk
on
tap
at
the
refuge
in
san
carlos
light
amber
color
small
head
smell
is
lightly
dilly
lightly
fruity
taste
is
not
funky
at
all
contrary
to
the
name
fruity
hard
candy
notes
but
dry
light
body
i
want
to
like
this
a
lot
more
than
i
do
really
nothing
special
here
only
a
half
decent
use
of
cherries
they
taste
old
and
bland
rather
than
tart
and
fresh
and
enlivening
pale
muted
pink
color
almost
brown
when
away
from
the
light
and
the
head
dies
quickly
this
is
maybe
the
least
impressive
prairie
beer
i
have
had
an
equalizer
if
you
will
nose
and
taste
are
less
cherry
and
more
wheat
malt
than
expected
winelike
which
is
better
in
smell
than
taste
cherries
are
a
little
medicinal
in
the
finish
and
the
beer
is
a
little
too
boring
to
support
that
alcohol
is
also
stronger
than
it
needs
to
be
this
one
just
seems
sloppy
and
for
a
brewery
capable
of
pure
magic
this
lets
me
down
hard
its
a
good
beer
plenty
of
brett
character
and
all
but
its
just
not
up
to
their
enormously
high
standard
meh
overall
for
me
overall
pretty
disappointed
not
a
great
sour
and
price
psh
o
not
my
favorite
prairie
beer
by
any
means
something
seems
a
bit
off
with
this
one
excellent
tart
cherry
flavor
with
light
must
good
sour
notes
fairly
lactic
and
acetic
not
notably
funky
which
suits
my
palate
light
sweetness
but
the
balance
is
sour
and
tart
maybe
i
got
too
excited
when
i
saw
funk
in
the
title
but
this
wasnt
funky
enough
the
cherry
doesnt
pop
the
sour
is
mild
and
the
tart
lingers
in
an
odd
fashion
that
becomes
dry
after
a
few
sips
it
just
needed
more
of
something
to
make
it
stand
out
serving
type
bottle
in
closure
the
acidity
really
latches
on
and
creates
a
simple
sour
flavor
to
strip
the
palate
of
thirst
and
brings
a
highly
refreshing
finish
though
mediumlight
for
a
sour
cherry
funk
trails
with
cherry
cider
brine
and
lime
but
only
for
a
fleeting
glimpse
decent
yet
mild
sour
taste
no
carbonation
or
bite
that
id
like
to
see
in
most
sours
overall
not
that
impressed
over
priced
for
what
it
is
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
am
starting
down
this
sour
road
so
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
try
out
and
get
a
taste
for
i
likely
wont
be
getting
another
unless
it
is
for
trading
purposes
followup
sampled
again
10sep14
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
riedel
vinum
zinfandel
glass
more
enjoyable
than
draft
with
more
interesting
yeast
and
barnyard
character
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
less
pronounced
medicinal
notes
also
a
fuller

poor

imo
weak

and
done
on
this
offering
ugh
i
love
me
some
sours
but
this
is
over
barring
biting
acidity
that
cuts
through
any
nuance
that
might
be
here
i
love
prairie
but
this
is
a
little
to
intense
even
for
me
cloudy
cherry
red
pour
with
some
orange
and
pink
highlights
and
a
small
pink
head
light
aroma
of
cherries
and
funk
dry
and
tart
taste
upfront
with
white
wine
grapes
and
cherries
the
main
flavors
light
body
also
has
some
yeast
flavors
present
as
well
medium
carbonation
and
light
acidity
finishes
with
a
mildly
tart
wet
flavor
pours
a
clear
goldenamberish
body
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
fades
the
smell
is
of
lactobacillus
tartness
and
a
little
bit
of
wheat
smell
really
reminds
me
of
a
berliner
weisse
there
is
a
slight
lacto
tartness
with
a
strong
amount
of
cherries
the
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
tingle
in
the
jaw
and
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
great
sour
ale
pours
a
pale
pink
with
zero
head
goes
down
smooth
silk
and
tastes
like
nothing
else
ive
had
excellent
brew
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
think
the
price
point
at
10
a
bottle
is
a
bit
much
something
i
have
noticed
with
prairie
the
prices
are
going
up
not
sure
why
anyways
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
day
like
another
review
said
if
your
looking
for
a
beer
that
will
make
you
pucker
this
is
not
it
its
a
crisp
refreshing
awa
with
a
perfect
hint
of
cherries
and
tarty
finish
i
enjoy
it
still
the
funky
gold
mosaic
is
my
preferred
wild
ale
from
prairie
drinks
very
easy
abv
seems
much
lower
if
you
like
them
really
sour
this
may
disappoint
made
me
very
happy
excellent

served
in

teku
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
color
with
a
couple
inch
white
head
that
stayed
around
a
long
time
theres
also
a
good
amount
of

i
like
the
aroma
the
brew
smells
like
citrusy
hops
tropical
fruit
lemon
peel
funk
and
some
grainy
malt
i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
grassiness
lime
and
green
grapesgrape
skins
noticeable
the
tartness
isnt
very
strong
at
all
but
with
that
being
said
it
still
tastes
good
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a

and
is

i
liked
this
brew
and
it
was
one
that
i
liked
more
and
more
the
longer
i
drank
it
definitely
worth
trying
tmo
the
feel
jumps
out
at

in
the
middle
the
finish
is
a
bit
odd
and
dry
and
musty
not
bad
but
probably
wont
be
more
than
a
one
time
affair
for
me
funky
nose
sour
breads
refreshing
body
would
work
well
paired
with
a
meal
very
funky
indeed
pretty
tart
with
banana
notes
good
but
not
great
aroma
is
lacking
flavor
makes
up
for
it
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
wish
i
had
it
fresh
to
see
if
the
dry
hopping
was
more
prevalent
not
worth
the
12
bottle
though
wow
this
is
a
nearperfect
beer
i
agree
its
more
berliner
than
sour
eminently
drinkable
perfect
hop
balance
that
shows
itself
then
quickly
leaves
to
present
the
other
flavors
this
is
my
idea
of
a
summer
beer
overall
this
beer
appeals
to
me
in
a
way
thats
hard
to
articulate
i
think
i
like
it
because
it
is
simply
weird
like
they
might
be
giants
or
something
anyway
i
am
very
sad
i
cant
get
it
here
in
seattle
without
trading
tart
aromas
of
peach
lemon
and
chardonnay
are
accompanied
by
must
and
grass
along
with
lightly
phenolic
pepper
flavor
is
exceedingly
lactic
tart
with
lemon
at
the
forefront
and
peach
skin
adding
complexity
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
musty
vinous
then
lightly
bready
very
complex
easy
drinking
beer
if
youre
into
sours
m
effervescent
light
to
medium
bodied
slightly
dry
yet
theres
a
fruit
juiciness
that
cuts
through
the
dryness
serving
type
bottle
overall

this
is
a
stellar
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
and
again
i
cant
say
its
my
absolute
favorite
dryhopped
sour
but
that
is
only
because
that
spot
is
occupied
by
one
of
my
favorite
sour
beers
period
this
one
however
is
one
that
i
hope
prairie
decides
to
produce
again
and
again
o
nice
mix
of
hoppyfunkytart
flavors
with
decent
complexity
though
doesnt
seem
quite
puttogether
almost
too
dirtyfeeling
in
a
way
kinda
wouldve
liked
to
see
a
base
beer
of
sorts
as
well
but
its
good
enough
to
kinda
forgive
those
factors
this
is
a
solid
beer
pours
and
bubbles
almost
like
champagne
with
tons
of
bubbles
an
an
inch
of
head
that
retains
for
a
while
it
smells
of
funk
and
lemon
the
first
sips
while
still
fridge
cold
are
nice
and
light
theres
almost
no
detection
of
alcohol
and
it
drinks
like
afruity
saison
as
it
warms
midway
through
it
turns
more
towards
the
sour
feel
with
a
tart
taste
and
a
dry
finish
almost
reminds
me
of
a
carbed
pinot
grigio
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
im
glad
i
traded
for
2
pours
an
opaque
but
bright
gold
with
small
fizzy
white
head
smell
soft
grain
dough
white
grapes
lemon
rind
unripe
peach
taste
lemon
upfront
followed
by
very
dillute
tropical
fruit
juice
passion
fruit
may
be
the
closest
then
as
the
carbonation
builds
it
moves
to
lactic
doused
canned
pear
and
as
it
dries
out
this
all
fades
into
grain
twang
and
brettland
with
acetic
and
white
wine
notes
and
finishing
with
unripe
peach
and
lemon
peel
very
tasty
with
quite
a
bit
going
once
its
warmed
up
o
lovely
beer
i
dont
get
enough
chances
to
get
the
wild
ales
as
much
as
id
like
to
grapefruit
passion
fruit
and
sour
citrus
explosion
not
sour
but
quite
tart
which
suits
the
fruit
flavors
presented
bitter
citrus
zest
seems
to
linger
with
tarts
forever
overall
i
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
and
it
lived
up
to
its
name
a
very
solid
sour
not
a
world
beater
by
any
means
but
a
good
beer
i
like
the
way
hops
are
played
in
the
beer
gives
real
character
overall
pretty
nice
grassy
mosaic
but
it
overpowers
the
nice
light
sour
funk
and
little
fruit
notes
4
a
fun
refreshing
tropical
hopped
saison
o
the
mosaic
hops
definitely
add
a
bit
of
a
tropical
feel
here
i
like
the
balance
on
this
and
the
lactobacillus
is
very
much
present
but
not
overwhelming
while
not
the
best
example
of
its
use
i
think
this
is
a
beer
worth
drinking
o
4
this
beer
is
nice
and
has
some
interesting
flavors
but
it
could
be
a
bit
more
sour
with
more
hops
pours
hazy
golden
in
color
with
a
fluffy
one
and
a
half
finger
white
head
that
has
great
retention
smell
has
some
incredibly
fresh
juicy
stone
fruit
aroma
primarily
peach
there
are
also
some
slightly
herbal
mango
and
pineapple
hop
aromas
taste
follows
nose
with
bright
juicy
tart
flavors
of
peach
crisp
tropical
hops
semi
sweet
light

to
balance
awesome
sour
hops
hit
your

a
nice

perfect
for
a
warm

o
interesting
and
very
good
beer
must
like
tart
amazingly
drinkable
and
bright
will
drink
this
any
day
serving
type
bottle
not
for
everyone
but
great
to
try
new
things
definitely
for
me
o
as
of
writing
this
review
ive
had
a
couple
goses
lambics
and
slightly
sour
fruit
beers
but
this
is
my
first
awa
not
sure
where
this
falls
on
the
sourness
scale
but
i
can
definitely
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
more
awas
i
like
it
a
lot
pours
a
hazy
white
and
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
aroma
if
funky
with
the
traditional
barnyard
aroma
pineapple
grape
mango
and
melon
on
the
fruit
end
and
just
a
touch
of
some
grassiness
flavor
follows
suit
and
is
slightly
tart
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
prairie
the
name
definitely
fits
the
beer
its
darn
solid
approved
o
luscious
tropical
fruit
nose
lemon
tart
acidity
white
wine
taste
and
a
dry
body
its
a
legit
summer
beer
that
definitely
quenches
your
thirst
sour
and
full
of
passionfruit
juicy
and
tangy
dry
brett
aftertaste
effervescent
and
spritzy
light
to
medium
bodied
very
easy
drinking
wish
i
had
a
few
bottles
of
this
othis
is
a
nice
summertime
beer
with
delicious
fruity
aromas
this
style
can
be
one
of
my
favorites
i
love
le
terroir
and
red
swingline
for
example
and
i
have
enjoyed
most
prairie
offerings
so
it
is
no
surprise
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
little
more
depth
in
flavor
might
help
but
as
is
i
would
easily
drink
more
of
this
lightly
briney
and
earthy
with
straw
and
hay
the
beers
ipa
tendencies
show
with
bold
citrusy
bitterness
and
candied
pine
needles
with
its
fledgling
sweet
balance
wisping
away
the
finish
it
a
tandem
of
hop
bitterness
and
barrel
sourness
to
strip
the
palate
of
all
thirst
and
to
keep
the
complexities
coming
even
deep
into
aftertaste

floral
and

aroma
you
expect
a
west
coast
ipa
but
get
a
mild
sour
with
strong
hop
characteristics
tons
of
off
white
head
you
might
expect
medium
to
heavy
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
residual
sugar
but
what
you
get
is
dry
light
bodied
and
low
carbonation
a
near
perfect
amalgam
of
ipa
and
farmhouse
sour
very
clean
finish
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
of
the
year
for
me
o
oh
this
is
nice
well
balanced
lightly
sour
funk
and
hops
o
great
beer
love
everything
ive
tried
from
prairie
and
this
is
no
exception
hops
and
certain
strains
of
brett
play
well
with
one
another
and
this
beer
is
a
very
balanced
example
of
that
very
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
the
sourness
comes
out
on
the
flavor
but
more
in
line
with
a
good
berliner
than
a
full
on
sour
beer
the
hop
flavors
are
well
integrated
and
fade
quick
before
any
bitterness
is
perceived
the
grain
is
light
and
the
yeast
has
a
nice
rustic
thing
going
on
quite
tasty
this
has
certainly
got
some
wheat
in
it
a
crisp
snappiness
does
it
impart
another
fine
ale
from
chase
and
co
glad
i
picked
up
2
of
them
despite
the
steep

this
was
very
nice
and
prairie
continues
to
make
great
stuff
through
the
roof
drinkability
not
terribly
sour
but
i
could
drink
this
in
warm
weather
all
day
long
if
the
price
was
kinder
this
has
a

feelvibe
to
it
prairie
you
have
hit
another
home
run
o
my
first
sour
beer
upon
the
first
smell
i
was
a
little
worried
but
to
me
this
beer
just
reminds
me
of
a
lemony
beer
it
almost
seems
as
if
the
sour
notes
are
derived
from
lemon
so
it
in
my
opinion
was
a
good
sour
to
be
my
first
not
to
funky
just
enough
o
farmhousestyled
ales
are
usually
not
my
thing
but
prairie
had
never
disappointed
before
so
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
shot
im
glad
i
did
this
is
a
fun
and
creative
spin
on
a
style
that
needs
some
invigoration
pour
is
hazed
pale
yellow
with
lots
of
tight

is

leathery

a

more
musky
leathery
brett
still
tons
of
pineapple
and
citrus
medium

assertive
carbonation
and
lightly
dry
finish
11
for
a
500
ml
bottle
overall
an
enjoyable
wild
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
have
a
fair
amount
of
this
id
prefer
a
little
more
tart
and
a
little
less
funk
but
other
than
that
its
solid
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
lacks
complexity
body
and
pizzaz
not
nearly
sour
enough
and
not
nearly
enough
hop
character
to
make
up
for
the
week
base
i
found
the
original
beer
to
be
better
than
this
ive
also
been
a
bit
more
disappointed
with
prairie
overall
lately
maybe
their
sudden
gain
of
popularity
affected
their
egos
and
they
presumably
think
everything
they
make
will
be
great
sorry
to
say
not
the
case
highlyrefreshing
and
slightly
interesting
but
somewhat
lacking
in
flavor
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
yellow
hazy
it
has
a
decent
little
white
head
aroma
was
this
weird
funky
lemon
type
aroma
really
different
and
must
be
the
mosaic
hops
flavor
was
nice
mildly
sour
with
a
strong
citrus
lemon
flavor
unique
beer
and
one
id
live
to
grab
a
bottle
of
pours
out
a
slightly
hazed
gold
with
a
thin
head
smell
is
gorgeous
fresh
bread
maltiness
and
some
light
wild
house
yeast
funk
the
majority
of
the
funk
in
the
nose
comes
from
some
raunchy
mosaic
hops
mango
peach
guava
guanabana
and
bo
flavor
is
big
on
crackery
malts
and
acid
hops
arent
as
much
in
the
forefront
as
its
the
dry
hopping
adding
those
massive
aromas
pleasant
and
very
light
and
refreshing
bitterness
in
the
finish
yeast
offers
up
some
fruitiness
refreshing
and
palate
cleansing
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
effervescent
acid
strips
the
tongue
its
a
shame
that
im
not
having
this
beer
with
food
this
screams
for
a
runny
washed
rind
cheese
or
fried
seafood
excellent
this
beer
is
outstanding
such
a
wonderful
mosaic
hop
aromatic
its
an
increasingly
popular
variety
but
examples
of
it
being
used
this
well
are
still
few
and
far
between
delicate
blonde
sour
beer
here
accentuated
by
generous
mosaic
dry
hopping
its
like
pineapple
juice
in
color
and
the
aroma
follows
suit
not
overly
sour
but
unique
to
prairie
the
way
elizabeth
was
where
that
one
let
me
down
though
this
one
takes
off
juicy
wet
hops
through
the
whole
beer
but
instead
of
a
bitter
finish
the
bacterial
funk
kicks
up
and
closes
it
out
quickly
with
a
tart
dry
and
very
bubbly
finish
i
love
the
yeast
complexion
in
this
its
dynamic
and
different
and
makes
this
what
it
is
the
hops
though
are
the
real
genius
its
tough
to
have
both
i
have
learned
hops
and
funk
they
can
really
cancel
each
other
out
sometimes
or
worse
produce
unpleasant
synergies
this
one
puts
all
that
behind
it
though
and
offers
both
a
highly
hopped
and
quite
wild
ale
very
impressive
stuff
from
prairie
its
beers
like
this
that
keep
them
as
one
of
the
premiere
operations
in
the
country
best
use
of
mosaic
ive
seen
since
odells
woodcut
number
6
o
not
as
outstanding
as
id
hoped
but
still
interesting
and
worthwhile
i
wish
there
were
more
mosaic
and
less
lemonfunky
strange
juice
still
id
have
another
if
someone
else
were
buying
serving
type
bottle
o
really
really
pleasant
and
refreshing
excellent
as
a
dinner
beer
or
by
itself
just
hard
not
to
gulp
it
down
it
is
so
tasty
o
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
prairie
beautiful
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
its
an
amazing
sour
beer
i
give
it
high
marks
all
around
as
its
a
very
well
balanced
beer
i
want
more
of
it
extremely
hazy
to
the
point
of
being
mostly
impenetrable
to
light
despite
the
light
golden
color
theres
a
half
inch
of
eggshell
white
tightly
knit
head
strong
aroma
of
floral
mosaic
hops
and
some
horse
blanket
funk
which
was
a
very
well
matched
blending
the
flavor
is
more
sour
initially
and
turns
to
floral
to
slightly
citrus
hops
at
the
back
of
the
palate
the
mouth
is
quite
smooth
and
delicate
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
hot
summer
the
beer
pours
a
dull
pale
honeyapple
cider
vinegar
yellow
without
sediment
and
is
topped
by
a
loose
white
head
that
fades
quickly
without
lacing
the
nose
has
pronounced
pineapplecitrus
in
the
forefront
followed
by
some
funk
and
grain
sweetness
especially
when
warming
its
juicy
and
aromatic
the
taste
has
similar
resemblance
to
pineapple
and
oranges
which
quickly
transitions
into
a
slightly
chewy
yeasty
middle
and
finishes
with
hoppy
tropical
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
funk
and
bitterness
potent
citrus
adequate
carbonation
that
comes
off
a
bit
creamy
masked
booze
and
a
semisweet
juicy
finish
this
beer
is
outstanding
when
fresh
drink
now
and
hits
the
dry
hopped
wild
ale
target
better
than
my
previous
style
favorites
there
are
almost
two
beers
here
the
first
shows
up
with
a
huge
juicy
hop
burst
on
second
sips
the
sour
and
funk
come
through
which
end
up
intermingling
perfectly
well
made
and
highly
recommended
overall
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
could
defiantly
see
myself
drinking
outdoors
in
the
summer
heat
however
at
8
99
per
500ml
i
doubt
ill
be
doing
so
this
drinks
like
a
beer
that
should
be
packaged
in
a
four
pack
or
even
a
six
pack
for
the
price
of
this
single
as
much
as
i
love
prairies
product
their
prices
are
slowly
pushing
me
away
prairie
just
keeps
hitting
all
the
sweet
spots
with
wellcrafted
brews
that
keep
the
flavor
hoppin
and
while
this
one
may
not
be
as
wild
as
some
of
its
brethren
it
sure
does
taste
good
and
has
just
enough
funk
to
pucker
you
up
overall
really
nice
the
fruit
flavors
work
really
well
with
the
funkiness
and
i
havent
had
regular
gold
but
i
think
the
hops
add
some
nice
citrus
well
done
pours
from
the
bottle
a
hazy
apricot
with
a
foamy
white
head
tons
of
carbonation
you
can
smell
this
one
during
the
pour
loads
of
bretty
barnyard
funk
hibiscus
and
tropical
fruit
a
swirl
brings
out
the
mango
and
papaya
maybe
a
touch
of
pine
taste
is
nicely
acidic
but
not
overly
sour
the
brett
isnt
nearly
as
pronounced
and
balances
well
with
the
floral
and
fruit
notes
middry
medium
mouth
thats
is
really
crisp
this
is
a
very
good
sour
saison
another
in
a
growing
line
of
creative
brews
from
prairie
artisan
very
light
and
crisp
this
drinks
a
lot
like
the
juice
that
it
resembles
it
pours
like
grapefruit
juice
so
it
no
wonder
that
the
flavor
is
dominate

this
beer
seriously
lacked
any
taste
tastes
like
lemon
lime
vitamins
pours
a
completely
translucent
pale
straw
color
with
some
bubbles
clinging
to
the
glass
looks
like
a

nose
has
a
wonderful
brett

flavor
is
delicate
tartness
with
some

touch
of

white

body
is

but
this
is
so
quaffable
a
beautifully
done
brett

among
my
favorites

with

of

pretty
nice
looking

flavor
lemongrass
apple

sharp
little
funky
sour
note
light
bodied
ale
lacks
true
crispness
or
dryness
mellow
feel
overall
this
is
damn
tasty
and
a
worthy
american
wild
ale
while
the
nose
promised
an
excessive
funkiness
the
taste
is
comparably
tame
it
begins
with
white
lemon
peel
among
bready
malts
and
a
gentle
strawy
wheat
foundation
the
carbonation
is
very
lively
pointing
out
the
refreshing
sour
qualities
while
the
actual
sourness
remains
quite
moderate
hiding
beneath
the
wheat
got
a
green
apple
fruitiness
as
well
as
a
yoghurty
of
flavor
to
it
which
shines
during
the
semidry
but
not
particular
sour
finish
drinks
fairly
easy
very
smooth
for
a
sour
while
trying
a
little
too
hard
to
stay
in
balance
by
not
providing
a
convincing
acidic
sourness
o
a
nice
showcase
of
brett
however
the
aroma
was
much
more
funky
than
the
taste
one
of
the
best
examples
of
brett
beers
on
the
market
othis
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
if
you
are
into
brett
the
beer
does
a
good
job
of
showing
off
the
tanginess
that
brett
can
impart
and
it
is
dry
without
getting
chalky
the
feel
is
a
really
good
match
for
the
flavors
too
a
nice
effort
by
wicked
weed
pour
is
pale
straw
yellow
slightly
hazed
with
a
good
bit
of
tight

with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
tart
funky
brett
on
the
aroma
hay
light
fruits
more
funk
yup
its
a
brett
beer
extremely
light
bodied
very
little
oak
or
vinous
notes
from
the
wine
barrels
but
with
a
refreshing
funky
bretty
influence
that
makes
it
very
pleasant
super
light
fruit
sweetness
high
carbonation
all
in
all
this
is
nice
but
maybe
even
too
light
on
the
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
for
brett
fans
o
a
bit
more
sour
on
the
nose
than
the
actual
taste
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
anything
as
this
was
a
joy
to
drink
spent
grains
wet
hay
oddly
heavy
on
the
tongue
little
to
no
tartness
or
sourness
and
the
heaviness
and
light
carbonation
just
allow
the
odd
flavors
to
sit
on
the
tongue
i
guess
my
palate
is
broken
but
i
just
didnt
understand
or
enjoy
this
very
much
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
i
kept
wishing
it
was
temptation
just
ok
o
infinitely
crushable
tart
and
flavorful
while
maintaining
a
high
level
of
drinkability
love
it
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
nice
job
wicked
weed
update
i
have
had
a
few
bottles
since
my
initial
review
and
upon
reevaluation
and
now
that
i
have
learned
to
appreciate
this
style
i
think
this
beer
is
very
well
made
it
has
a
nice
crisp
lemoncitrus
flavor
its
a
very
well
made
beer
its
a
great
one
to
cleanse
the
palate
after
drinking
some
strong
stouts
that
might
linger
o
overall
its
ok
solid
beer
but
nothing
really
sands
out
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
as
i
have
high
expectations
for
ww
3
75
very
well
done
the
flavor
has
melon
peach
and
tropical
fruit
notes
lots
of
fruity
esters
coming
off
from
the
yeast
theres
a
brett
funk
drying
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
falls
off
of
the
palate
nicely
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
the
brew
appears
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
cap
the
smell
is
a
little
tropical
with
a
dry
and
grainy
feel
before
cheesy
notes
of
funk
evolve
the
taste
is
dry
with
neutral
grain
flavoring
slightly
husky
blending
to
notes
that
are
mildly
tropical
and
vinous
some
oakiness
towards
the
back
has
almost
a
cinnamin
spice
note
about
it
this
is
light
bodied
modestly
carbonated
and
very
easy
drinking
the
beauty
in
this
beer
is
the
subtle
nuance
but
i
dont
think
i
liked
it
enough
to
want
to
seek
out
any
more
serenity
now
very
bready
and
bretty
with
horse
blanket
and
feet
flavor
is
fairly
tart
with
earthy
brett
character
pours
a
clear
straw
upon
which
a
frothy
bubbly
head
forms
but
settles
to
a
fine
ring
smell
is
stinky
funky
brett
flowers
leather
lemon
and
pear
over
a
touch
of
biscuit
the
flavor
dials
up
the
floral
notes
a
touch
reminiscent
of
orval
but
less
intense
and
with
an
added
apple
and
grape
juicy
tartness
and
some
oatmeallike
grain
tart
but
not
excessively
so
and
not
so
funky
as
the
aroma
dry
and
super
refreshing
second
pour
with
the
yeast
is
less
funky
and
more
floral
a
very
nice
refreshing
snappy
brett
beer
im
impressed
with
wicked
weed
they
have
a
very
unique
strain
of
brett
thats
pineapple
heavy
and
it
works
well
in
most
of
the
beers
ive
had
serenity
shows
nice
fruit
qualities
a
touch
of
funk
and
sky
high
drinkability
i
wouldnt
pass
this
up
if
i
came
across
a
bottle
i
think
i
expected
more
body
and
perhaps
bolder
flavor
but
this
is
still
an
excellent
brew
its
incredibly
easydrinking
4

overall
not
too
bad
kind
of
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
picked
up
a
case
of
this
brew
in
hickory
nc
the
first
round
of
bottles
that
came
out
of
the
brewery
it
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
minimal
head
lots
of
lemon
zest
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
follows
suit
the
funk
is
very
mild
so
i
see
why
some
folks
arent
fully
behind
this
brew
however
imo
this
is
probably
the
best
introduction
to
sours
ive
ever
had
ive
turned
a
couple
people
on
to
this
brew
who
have
already
embraced
the
style
and
tried
much
more
tart
offerings
they
wouldnt
have
touched
otherwise
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
maybe
i
will
o
some
promise
but
not
what
i
hoped
for
this
is
an
oddly
unique
beer
lots
of
flavors
combining
in
unusual
ways
and
a
mouthfeel
that
adds
character
and
brightness
pours
straw
colored
with
a
very
fizzy
white
head
not
much
aroma
other
than
some
sour
yeast
taste
is
very
carbonated
crisp
funky
sour
a
little
lemon
and
finishes
pretty
slick
it
is
like
a
sour
light
bodied
champagne
to
me
i
will
throw
out
a
disclaimer
that
i
dont
get
into
this
style
much
i
do
like
some
farmhouse
ales
but
this
one
isnt
for
me
i
think
it
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
for
those
who
do
give
it
a
try
o
light
and
subtle
a
touch
of
butter
solid
o
extremely
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
and
a
wonderful
showcase
for
the
brett
i
could
easily
drink
this
one
over
and
over
again
and
i
understand
why
it
is
a
medal
winner
from
gabf
a
very
well
constructed
beer
with
good
aromas
flavors
and
mouthfeel
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
i
wish
was
feasible
to
have
all
the
time
i
would
have
this
beer
every
week
if
it
had
that
sort
of
availability
the
brett
provides
such
a
unique
bite
and
estery
flavor
and
the
carb
just
really
gives
everything
a
jolt
there
isnt
much
to
the
nose
beyond
a
typical
brett
funk
but
thats
just
fine
by
me
this
beer
doesnt
need
any
adjuncts
it
is
a
showcase
of
brett
and
absolutely
delicious

could
and
would
easily
drink
this
any

o
a

will
have
to
try
more
from
ww
brewing
poured
from
a

into

the
beer
is
a
pale
goldenrod

with
a
steady
flow

thin
sparse

head

of

the

clean
solid
beer
my
second
and
another
stellar
beer
from
wicked
weed
this
is
a
little
more
basic
than
the
sour
ipa
just
a
funky
bretty
wheat
based
brew
done
in
white
wine
barrels
its
a
really
pale
brew
frosted
blonde
with
a
great
big
white
head
with
nice
thick
foam
lace
left
behind
it
smells
like
something
out
of
crooked
stave
of
jolly
pumpkin
a
curious
bacterial
and
brett
culture
than
really
makes
the
mouth
water
there
is
a
real
light
wheat
malt
here
and
the
yeast
does
the
vast
majority
of
the
flavoring
plenty
of
oak
and
white
grape
character
from
the
barrel
earthy
and
funky
which
meshes
with
the
yeast
really
well
its
not
super
complex
but
its
interesting
enough
not
lacking
anything
but
a
heavy
dry
hop
with
a
cool
varietal
could
make
this
even
better
i
think
light
on
the
hop
character
as
it
is
acidic
more
from
the
wine
barrel
than
the
yeast
i
think
but
a
pleasant
dry
tartness
finishes
it
out
carbonation
is
interesting
its
active
but
not
poppy
feather
light
feeling
just
gentle
and
comfortable
overall
a
beer
i
would
love
to
age
a
little
and
let
develop
but
one
thats
drinking
awfully
well
right
now
a
good
first
few
offerings
from
these
guys
really
fun
stuff
they
are
doing
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
with
malt
grain
lemon
acidic
and
brett
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
malt
grain
brett
and
earth
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
seems
to
have
a
more
sour
aspect
in
the
aroma
to
me
i
love
this
beer
one
of
the
best
by
ww
highly
recommended
and
if
you
can
do
it
side
by
side
with
a
russian
river
temptation
m
light
refreshing
and
dissipating
i
see
this
beer
developing
into
a
real
treasure
in
another
612
months
maybe
even
longer
all
the
reviews
i
have
seen
show
people
complaining
that
it
isnt
funky
our
sour
enough
for
them
honestly
this
tastes
just
like
it
should
it
is
not
a
wild
ale
it
is
a
saison
aged
in
wine
barrles
with
brett
and
it
smells
and
tastes
liek
it
should
people
get
so
upset
when
a
style
isnt
what
they
think
it
should
be
it
is
in
the
ballpark
of
the
style
and
a
wonderful
introductory
offering
from
wicked
weed
in
terms
of
bottle
options
search
it
out
with
confidence
overall
the
diacetyl
doesnt
fully
kill
it
but
it
does
detract
and
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
dislike
it
the
beer
is
hazy
and
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
fizzes
quickly
receding
to
a
thin
wispy
layer
aromas
include
grain
brettanomyces
lemon
oak
similar
flavor
finishing
with
a
mild
puckering
sensation
fairly
light
in
body
a
touch
of
earthiness
with
tart
citrus
overall
a
tasty
beer
o
damn
now
i
see
why
they
selected
this
beer
to
be
their
first
bottle
release
a
perfect
example
of
how
beautiful
brett
can
be
this
pours
a
cloudy
pale
goldhazy
straw
in
color
theres
an
aroma
of
wet
hay
and
funky
straw
with
some
lemongrass
100
brett
fermented
and
that
characteristic
shines
through
the
flavor
is
lightly
tart
crisp
and
bretttastic
d
this
was
a
great
brew
that
perfectly
showcased
what
brett
can
be
the
scent
and
taste
were
great
and
the
body
was
fitting
the
finish
was
clean
and
not
very
harsh
so
it
was
actually
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
extreme
for
the
style
but
very
well
crafted
and
very
enjoyable
o
a
good
beer
overall
id
like
a
bit
more
depth
and
carbonation
but
its
tasty
and
drinkable
flavor
is
more
tart
than
the
aroma
with
subtle
bourbon
notes
not
a
sourwilde
ale
fan
tastes
too
much
like
vinegar
and
over
the
top
acidity
needs
more
balance
overall
pretty
well
done
and
probably
my
second
favorite
of
the
ww
offerings
thus
far
says
a
lot
coming
from
someone
who
is
not
necessarily
a
cherry
fan
dark
brown
body
with
a
thin
beige
cap
aromas
of
dark
fruit
lactic
funk
cherries
oak
plums
leather
currants
and
raisins
with
brettanomyces
and
lacto
tart
fruity
finish
dried
fruit
leather
with
cherry
notes
mild
sweetness
complex
and
tasty
of
the
five
wicked
weed
sours
ive
encountered
this
is
the
standout
a
deft
balance
of
barrel
and
bugyeast
tart
and
sweet
and
warms
like
a
champ
if
youre
going
to
make
the
jump
to
wicked
weed
this
is
the
beer
to
do
it
o
really
the
fruittart
of
the
beer
dominate
with
the
bourbon
barrels
being
secondary
but
thats
a
great
change
of
pace
from
so
many
beers
that
tend
to
be
dominated
by
bourbon
characteristics
bourbon
barrel
aroma
but
american
wild
taste
black
and
cloudy
with
a
short
lived
head
aroma
is
big
on
oak
and
vanilla
but
the
taste
says
otherwise
a
oak
up
front
but
there
is
plenty
of
sour
fruit
middle
to
finish
light
body
and
medium
high
carbonation
tart
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
very
good
but
i
wish
the
bourbon
came
through
at
all
the
cherries
and
roast
play
well
quickly
smell
has
a
deep
acidic
sour
aroma
and
a
large
oak
wood
presence
right
up
front
some
light
sour
dark
cherry
aroma
follows
with
some
hints
of
vanilla
tannin
and
a
slight
toffee
malt
that
is
somewhat
hard
to
detect
through
all
the
acidity
taste
follows
nose
with
a
nice
acidic
sour
flavor
forward
followed
by
notes
of
tart
dark
cherries
oak
vanilla
vanilla
toffee
caramel
and
a
slight
bourbon
presence
in
the
finish
lift
crisp
refreshing
medium
to
high
carbonation
o
overall
by
no
means
a
perfect
beer
but
certainly
a
very
enjoyable
wild
ale
lots
of
little
nuances
which
makes
the
drinking
experience
fun
as
you
search
for
flavors
and
the
proper
description
of
them
havent
had
much
of
wicked
weed
yet
but
have
really
liked
the
initial
offerings
glad
i
have
several
other
examples
waiting
to
be
tasted
pour
is
virtually
black
with

chocolate

very
light
cherry

flavor
is

gets
fairly
sweet
malts
are

and
lightly
roasted
cherry
flavors
come
in
and
lots
of
sugar
sweetness
fuller

very
creamy
but
a
bit
slick
high
carb
overall
i
liked
this
it
reminded
me
of
like
a
alcoholic
black
cherry
cola
vinegary
and
tart
cherries
in
the
taste
good
and
worth
checking
out
for
sure
slight
traces
of
vinegar
on
the
nose
and
tongue
aside
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
excellent
blend
of
a
wild
ale
and
a
stout
id
drink
it
plenty
of
times
again
this
beer
is
sour
enough
for
the
cherries
to
come
through
not
quite
tart
of
darkness
sour
but
makes
for
an
enjoyable
unique
beer
pours
a
dark
redblackish
color
that
looks
like
shiraz
wine
in
my
snifter
glass
smelltaste
is
tart
fruits
and
the
kentucky
four
roses
barrel
adds
a
little
oak
flavor
but
no
bourbon
o
pretty
spectacular
right
up
there
with
russian
river
sours
impressive
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
the
body
just
isnt
quite
there
and
it
kind
of
hurts
this
one
as
is
the
taste
comes
off
a
touch
watery
and
the
bourbon
barrel
does
nothing
but
kind
of
muddle
things
up
in
the
middle
its
a
pretty
solid
sour
stout
but
ive
heard
this
compared
to
tart
of
darkness
and
its
just
not
quite
at
that
level
right
now
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
its
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
with
a
mocha
head
that
holds
well
the
aroma
has
hints
of
chocolate
before
giving
in
to
a
fruity
essence
of
cherry
and
bacterial
funk
some
mineral
character
is
present
in
the
flavor
along
with
tart
cherries
and
a
backing
of
the
previously
mentioned
chocolate
malt
its
medium
bodied
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
was
decent
with
a
fair
balance
of
malt
verse
tartness
however
it
was
not
as
glorious
as
some
have
made
this
out
to
be
despite
the
description
sounding
wonderful
i
really
dont
think
its
worth
the
price
pretty
much
jet
black
some
brown
showing
through
on
the
outer
edges
very
small
head
from
the
pour
diminishing
quickly
into
what
looks
like
a
cup
of
black
coffee
no
head
at
all
after
three
minutes
in
the
snifter
small
carb
bubbles
still
rising
to
the
top
more
bourbon
than
tart
on
the
nose
no
chocolate
or
coffee
in
this
style
so
the
bourbon
has
a
little
more
room
to
stand
out
bourbon
to
start
with
a
faint
boozienss
a
very
crisp
tart
finish
not
completely
sour
just
some
cherry
tart
really
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
for
a
sour
thin
an
heavily
carbonated
for
me
this
doesnt
do
well
with
the
bourbon
missing
some
of
that
savory
bourbon
velvet
that
i
have
come
to
enjoy
in
many
bbl
beers
overall
this
is
very
good
but
im
partial
to
the
bourbon
influence
in
many
beers
im
glad
i
got
to
have
it
but
its
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
just
nothing
really
awesome
about
it
black
angel
is
loaded
with
tart
cherries
dark
fruit
sweet
cherries
and
an
easily
approachable
wild
sourness
ive
had
other
brews
from
wicked
weed
that
i
prefer
but
this
is
quite
enjoyable
in
its
own
way
cherry
sour
is
such
a
base
term
this
beer
is
far
more
than
that
its
well
blended
and
has
complexity
and
nuance
in
spades
overall
high
marks
for
this
one
4
5
overall
a
good
tasting
moderately
sour
beer
i
think
the
bourbon
takes
away
from
the
rest
of
the
character
and
a
strengthening
of
other
characters
and
a
straight
oak
barrel
would
have
improved
it
just
a
bit
overall
a
tangy
taste
of
asheville
bottled
for
your
very
own
pleasure
this
was
a
huge
surprise
for
me
folks
were
traveling
through
asheville
asked
for
requests
and
i
mentioned
ww
jackpot
i
am
just
starting
to
venture
into
the
belgianssoursetc
so
this
looked
a
little
intimidating
when
it
arrived
i
am
not
a
fan
of
red
wine
anyways
poured
from
500ml
bottle
into
my
snifter
14
finger
of
off
white
head
over
a
dark
nearly
black
body
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
not
huge
on
the
nose
though
more
came
out
as
warmed
to
room
temp
mainly
a
slight
sour
note
cherry
and
a
bit
of
oak
the
taste
was
excellent
a
hint
of
cheery
up
front
followed
by
a
stronger
cherry
and
oak
hit
wrapped
up
in
a
slight
red
wine
haze
just
a
bit
just
enough
red
wine
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
of
beer
and
a
bit
of
wine
a
little
on
the
drier
side
overall
this
was
a
winner
wicked
weed
rocks
dont
let
your
fear
of
sours
or
red
wine
keep
you
away
from
this
gem
as
it
warmed
up
that
cherry
and
barrel
flavor
exploded
if
presented
with
another
ww
opportunity
i
would
likely
try
another
variety
but
if
i
saw
this
in
local
distro
i
have
to
say
that
i
would
go
for
it
poured
into
a
teku
dark
reddish
brown
no
light
can
get
through
with
a
wispy
off
white
head
smells
like
a
sour
that
phenolic
alcohol
smell
underlined
with
cherries
and
plum
huge
pop
of
taste
up
front
sour
cherries
and
then
it
just
fades
away
dont
get
much
or
any
of
the
bourbon
flavor
maybe
it
did
its
work
to
mellow
out
the
flavors
doesnt
linger
at
all
maybe
a
bit
of
oak
that
dries
out
your
mouth
this
really
wants
you
to
keep
drinking
it
o
well
balanced
mild
sour
and
bourbon
but
all
very
apparent
ive
had
two
of
the
barrel
project
beers
from
wicked
weed
and
while
both
styles
have
been
done
numerous
times
in
the
past
by
numerous
brewers
wicked
weeds
versions
were
both
very
unique
and
very
delicious
black
angel
is
spritzy
tart
complex
and
flat
out
good
thanks
again
wil
good
shit
mang
lightly
of
peppercorn
the
sour
ale
nose
dives
into
a
dry
cider
vinous
and
tanninrich
taste
and
texture
thats
obviously
sucking
the
wood
spice
vanillin
and
toffeelike
caramel
impressions
from
those
oaken
soaked
bourbon
barrels
boozy
with
that
kentucky
elixir
the
beer
leaves
final
impressions
of
bourbondipped
cherry
covered
chocolates
but
replacing
that
sticky
sweetess
with
vinous
sourness
o
the
most
different
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
really
like
it
and
want
to
try
it
again
drank
in
the
tasting
room
of
wicked
weed
downstairs
from
the
main
lounge
o
another
stop
on
the
sour
exploration
gave
a
local
a
shot
pricey
for
500
ml
but
interesting
give
it
some
time
to
warm
and
open
up
probably
something
that
is
better
paired
with
food
for
full
effect
i
find
myself
lucky
to
have
a
steady
consistent
supply
of
this
beer
served
from
bottle
in
to
a
dogfish
head
stemmed
snifter
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
cherry
wood
sour
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
sour
tart
cherries
wood
caramel
bread
and
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
all
of
the
aspects
one
would
expect
from
a
sour
stout
make
their
way
through
in
both
the
nose
and
the
flavor
as
ive
said
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
soured
stout
movement
but
this
one
manages
to
throw
a
nice
cherry
aspect
to
soften
the
blow
for
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
rather
enjoyable
overall
overall
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
as
some
of
their
other
sours
on
wood
have
been
excellent
this
one
just
a
little
too
one
sided
to
be
great
would
of
been
much
better
if
the
taste
was
as
balanced
as
the
nose
pours
an
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
with
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
cherry
funk
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
cocoa
fruit
and
acidic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
interesting
combination
of
cocoa
and
fruit
all
around
dark
brown
pour
with
some
maroon
around
the
edges
like
a
cherry
cola
topped
off
with
a
small
offwhite
fizzy
head
that
held
at
a
thin
ringlet
leaving
a
few
dots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
in
the
nose
dark
chocolate
malts
red
wine
and
cherries
prunes
some
oaky
hints
in
there
in
the
taste
dark
chocolate
dark
fruit
with
a
slight
acetic
tartness
more
like
youd
get
from
a
flemish
red
than
anything
else
i
thought
sort
of
a
blend
of
cherries
and
prunes
andor
figs
with
a
little
pulpy
sweetness
in
there
as
well
some
oak
from
the
barrel
came
out
but
i
didnt
really
pick
up
on
any
bourbonvanilla
notes
this
seemed
like
a
good
idea
that
just
could
have
been
executed
better
but
that
said
this
was
still
a
good
brew
medium
body
good
drinkability
id
like
to
try
this
again
and
see
if
it
improves
assuming
theyre
going
to
keep
brewing
it
o
a
great
beer
that
holds
its
own
with
the
likes
of
bruery
and
jester
king
the
roast
over
powered
any
cherry
pie
notes
for
me
though
bottle
share
at
proof
very
very
deep
brown
with
light
chocolate
colored
head
thick
collar
some
legs
fair
lacing
taste
and
aroma
are
of
tart
cherry
dark
roasted
malt
and
some
tart
dry
yeasty
funk
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
this
reminded
me
of
tart
of
darkness
from
the
bruery
very
good
beer
overall
overall
pretty
tasty
doesnt
blend
the
flavors
all
that
well
but
thats
my
biggest
complaint
my
1000th
ba
beer
review
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
dark
opaque
brown
coloring
with
a
thin
halo
of
white
head
aromas
of
spicy
and
charred
wood
tart
cherries
earthy
notes
and
a
candy
sweetness
flavors
are
tart
and
crisp
forward
with
a
solid
grape
and
cherry
blend
of
fruit
sweetness
and
a
charred
and
slightly
bitter
backbone
earthy
and
woody
notes
help
round
out
the
palate
nicely
smooth
light
bodied
with
a
crispness
throughout
fruity
notes
linger
with
a
sharp
spice
and
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
crisp
tart
slightly
puckering
finish
good
beer
slightly
purple
colored
but
mostly
just
blackish
brown
and
very
dark
head
is
nice
and
fluffy
before
it
fades
to
a
simple
ring
aroma
is
sweet
juicy
robust
woody
light
vanilla
raspberry
cherry
plum
graham
cracker
pie
crust
right
on
as
described
and
bright
mouthwatering
tartness
taste
is
brighter
and
more
tart
very
clean
not
overwhelmingly
pielike
by
any
means
but
certainly
very
cherry
alike
to
biting
into
fresh
cherries
with
purple
grape
skins
wine
oak
and
maybe
funky
brett
very
nice
texture
is
smooth
juicy
and
dry
a
bit
of
finely
gritty
dryness
through
the
sour
finish
great
beer
i
dont
really
think
this
beer
is
as
sour
as
some
people
are
stating
its
nice
and
tart
but
not
too
bad
at
all
very
drinkable
imho
i
had
it
from
the
bottle
paired
with
seared
tuna
and
lobster
tail
this
is
a
great
beer
with
the
cherries
up
front
a
little
vanilla
slight
wood
all
around
a
very
well
done
drinkable
dark
cherry
sour
not
much
bourbon
though
all
around
a
really
good
beer
that
id
like
to
drink
regularly
would
so
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
delicious
beer
again
if
the
opportunity
arose
o
certainly
very
good
but
not
my
favorite
style
overall
its
just
a
solid
brown
cherry
sour
beer
recommended
o
if
you
enjoy
cherries
and
tartsour
beers
then
you
should
definitely
grab
this
one
when
you
go
to
wicked
weed
i
really
enjoyed
the
strong
tartness
and
puckering
mouthfeel
yum
o
the
oaky
barrel
flavor
play
well
on
the
tart
cherry
flavors
this
one
will
have
you
puckering
dark
pretty
much
black
in
the
dim
lighting
just
a
small
ring
of
a
head
around
the
edge
the
nose
is
sour
cherry
with
dark
roast
grain
and
a
creamy
element
cherry
sourness
and
wood
balanced
beautifully
with
some
mellow
chocolate
and
dark
malts
not
especially
funky
or
sweet
but
bone
dry
and
smooth
making
for
a
very
drinkable
treat
nice
malty
aroma
has
a
tart
fruity
overtone
and
a
hint
of
horehound
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
a
thick
wheat
head
malty
flavor
has
woody
and
tart
fruity
notes
giving
it
an
almost
winelike
nature
smooth
texture
has
good
fizz
and
rather
winelike
body
leaving
a
tart
and
woody
finish
distinctive
enjoyable
tasty
extremely
acid
beer
oak
taste
little
bitter
at
the
end
this
is
a
great
way
to
get
into
sour
beers
but
once
youve
had
some
great
ones
this
leaves
you
missing
big
flavors
i
wanted
more
cherry
or
fruit
forward
sourness
coming
through
it
lacked
a
big
vinegar
backbone
it
had
very
little
funk
perfect
for
those
interested
in
dipping
their
toes
into
the
world
of
sour
beers
rather
than
diving
in
headfirst
theres
a
bit
of
sour
cherry
tartness
but
its
restrained
not
a
whole
lot
of
depth
to
it
but
what
it
does
it
does
fairly
well
malt
isnt
very
pronounced
hops
arent
a
factor
no
hot
alcohol
taste
which
is
good
for
a
9
abv
brew
a
well
done
effort
by
sam
adams
okay
at
best
worth
8
dollars
add
another
star
for
the
fancy
bottle
once
again
feel
let
down
by
samuel
adams
i
could
have
spent
my
money
on
something
better
very
tart
sour
taste
one
glass
is
plenty
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
thick
cream
colored
head
good
carbonation
smells
a
bit
sour
almost
like
a
white
wine
great
tartsweet
taste
that
balance
each
other
well
finishes
with
slight
alcohol
warmth
very
refreshing
this
is
a
great
beer
deep
amber
color
with
a
touch
of
red
tan
foam
and
a
sour
but
not
unpleasant
aroma
i
really
noticed
red
wine
flavors
fruity
and
dry
not
overpowering
to
people
who
may
think
an
american
wild
ale
sounds
intimidating
overall
pretty
good
so
good
and
so
different
its
nice
to
know
the
big
guys
can
still
pull
off
beer
like
this
its
cool
stuff
somewhere
in
the
flanders
red
neighborhood
but
it
feels
sour
from
a
blend
not
sour
from
a
raw
ferment
which
is
fine
but
thats
the
point
of
departure
for
me
deep
brick
red
color
with
some
haze
to
it
and
a
tall
tan
head
with
100
retention
as
long
as
i
drink
this
the
head
holds
up
the
nose
here
is
tangy
with
some
fruity
notes
dried
cherries
or
even
cranberries
seem
obvious
but
red
wine
tannins
plums
lacto
and
wet
oak
are
all
there
too
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
sourness
coming
fist
even
before
the
malt
which
is
big
and
round
and
caramel
based
but
only
moderately
sugary
pucker
but
not
caustic
on
the
acidity
and
its
short
lived
and
quickly
balanced
out
by
the
fruit
and
the
density
of
the
grain
a
really
unique
beer
especially
at
this
abv
which
i
think
is
an
odd
feature
for
it
heavy
oak
too
really
pleasant
this
time
of
year
super
impressed
with
the
clever
uniqueness
of
this
beer
and
its
overall
quality
im
so
used
to
seeing
the
seasonals
and
boston
lager
from
these
guys
its
nice
to
know
they
are
capable
of
beers
this
special
worth
way
more
than
what
they
ask
for
it
i
like
that
too
great
balanced
sour
beer
with
enough
sweet
to
balance
the
tart
and
a
little
bit
of
funk
and
barrel
character
to
boot
pours
a
deep
ruby
with
a
shortlasting
light
tan
head
a
little
soapy
lacing
is
left
behind
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
slightly
tart
like
fresh
sour
cherries
the
taste
though
is
underwhelming
a
little
bit
of
the
tartness
remains
but
disconnected
from
any
other
flavor
there
isnt
much
of
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
process
noticeable
either
beyond
a
hint
of
wood
towards
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
also
has
a
little
bit
of
fizzy
quality
to
the
body
despite
not
much
carbonation
it
could
be
and
should
be
much
better
o
unique
belgian
style
red
very
complex
and
enjoyable
slightly
sweet
i
like
seeing
sam
adams
do
these
out
of
the
box
small
batches
incredible
drinkability
i
have
a
hard
time
not
purchasing
a
stony
brook
red
every
time
i
come
across
one
this
has
long
ago
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
is
supersmooth
a
very
drinkable
brew
not
as
sour
as
some
others
but
the
cherrylike
character
and
firm
malt
backing
give
it
a
pleasant
balance
and
smoothness
while
allowing
the
sour
character
to
come
through
cons
can
be
hard
to
find
9
per
bottle
i
know
i
may
be
in
the
minority
in
this
one
but
this
beer
tastes
like
straight
teriyaki
sauce
it
may
just
be
the
bottle
i
drank
i
hope
so
but
the
taste
was
just
horrible
the
coloring
and
mouthfeel
is
alright
but
otherwise
avoid
this
at
all
costs
pours
a
pretty
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
a
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
and
sides
of
the
glass
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
lots
of
sediment
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
toasted
malts
from
a
oak
barrel
the
taste
is
really
complex
with
a
tart
cherry
at
first
which
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
oak
that
finishes
with
a
slightly
vinegar
finish
more
probably
going
on
for
sure
but
is
hard
to
pinpoint
overall
a
different
brew
but
tasty
o
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
i
was
surprised
that
it
held
up
for
so
long
and
im
strongly
considering
picking
up
another
just
to
see
what
it
would
be
like
fresh
if
i
do
so
ill
certainly
update
the
review
pours
reddish
tinged
brown
lighter
on
bottom
some
white
foam
sits
atop
caramel
notes
light
malty
sweetness
little
oak
in
there
light
sour
taste
that
builds
to
a
pucker
woodsy
sour
cherry
fruit
mixed
full
bold
mouthfeel
really
good
o
samuel
adams
greatest
achievement
with
stony
brook
red
is
making
a
near
doubledigit
alcohol
beer
drink
like
half
its
content
this
flanders
red
if
you
will
has
a
nice
touch
of
oak
aging
and
funky
sourness
to
it
that
creates
a
different
experience
but
its
greatest
achievement
is
also
its
undoing
i
feel
the
strength
in
numbers
doesnt
shine
through
but
the
slightly
heavier
body
and
fuller
maltiness
leads
this
beer
down
a
path
of
less
drinkability
a
detour
from
the
course
the
style
originally
intended
its
nice
to
see
big
brewers
like
this
playing
around
with
sour
beers
though
overall
this
beer
has
some
good
qualities
to
it
brightness
and
good
brett
balance
but
overall
its
a
little
too
vinegary
and
acidic
for
me
the
flavors
arent
quite
developed
for
me
the
beer
pours
some
light
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
the
head
is
an
offwhite
color
and
has
a
foamy
texture
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
ruby
red
the
beer
has
a
strong
tarty
smell
with
a
slight
oak
and
vanilla
note
the
tart
is
a
dark
cherry
tart
with
dark
fruit
notes
the
other
notes
enhance
the
tart
and
compliment
it
well
there
are
also
some
dark
fruit
notes
but
they
get
lost
in
the
tart
smell
the
taste
notes
are
similar
to
the
smell
the
taste
has
the
same
funk
taste
but
the
dark
fruit
notes
are
much
stronger
the
oak
and
vanilla
notes
are
still
there
but
they
come
at
the
end
of
road
the
lighted
toasted
malts
make
an
appearance
in
the
taste
the
beer
has
thick
and
sticky
feeling
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
biting
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
notes
its
krieky
and
jammy
with
plenty
of
character

and
very

for

a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
decent
brew
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
but
on
sale
at
the
grocery
it
was
worth
it
doesnt
quite
hold
up
to
the
belgian
brews
taste
throws
down
a
flanders
style
flavor
profile
rich
malts
nutty
yeast
with
a
light
brett
and
sourness
fruits
are
still
big
and
its
more
tart
than
sour
unfortunately
still
though
not
a
bad
effort
for
sam
adams
the
barrel
character
is
very
light
and
it
needs
more
sourness
but
the
abv
is
well
integrated
and
there
are
some
nice
flavors
to
be
found
here
id
probably
grab
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
over
this
at
the
similar
price
point
but
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
well
enough
o
im
pretty
sure
this
has
a
mere
85
simply
because
it
isnt
that
tart
to
me
this
is
closer
to
a
90
its
far
from
the
most
tart
but
its
balanced
and
delicate
a
trait
thats
lacking
in
many
murican
sours
of
course
i
love
a
big
bruteforce
sour
monster
too
dont
get
me
wrong
given
my
experiences
with
13th
hour
stout
and
new
world
tripel
last
year
i
think
its
safe
to
say
i
generally
enjoy
sas
barrelaged
funkladen
brews
a
whole
lot
this
deserves
some
credit
for
being
decidedly
funky
but
the
vinegar
is
a
bit
much
as
is
the
sweetness
regardless
its
interesting
apparently
worth
both
trying
and
aging
i
loved
this
fresh
aged
its
still
delicious
but
it
loses
something
in
the
long
run
the
yeast
dominates
and
hurts
it
a
touch
can
this
stuff
in
a
bomber
for
about
10
bucks
and
it
is
a
descent
sour
ale
for
that
price
you
cant
beat
it
compared
to
some
of
the
other
sour
ales
that
can
go
for
as
much
as
26
30
dollars
a
bomber
you
wont
regret
this
one
need
more
characters
so
im
making
filler
words
taste
of
roasted
malts
cherry
and
other
sour
characters
the
sourness
of
the
taste
is
not
explosive
like
some
sours
can
be
thats
what
i
liked
this
one
better
than
other
sour
i
have
tried
overall
pretty
smooth
american
belgium
ale
with
some
tart
characters
kind
of
grows
on
you
but
i
have
had
better
representations
of
the
style
the
body
is
medium
and
im
surprised
that
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
dry
as
quickly
as
i
might
expect
its
semidry
most
of
the
way
before
some
wood
and
acidity
throw
that
dryness
into
the
finish
it
has
a
bit
of
sharpness
to
it
but
keeps
in
check
o
good
variation
of
a
belgian
beer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
o
for
a
series
touting
that
it
is
aged
in
oak
barrels
this
beer
doesnt
taste
oaky
also
it
may
not
be
what
you
expect
when
you
buy
a
red
beer
it
is
much
sweeter
than
what
i
expected
that
being
said
it
is
a
nice
change
to
drink
something
like
this
as
i
mentioned
earlier
it
almost
drinks
like
a
wine
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
at
all
it
is
fruity
and
you
dont
really
notice
the
9
abv
definitely
worth
a
shot
and
i
would
overall
recommend
it
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
when
i
saw
this
labeled
as
a
red
beer
i
was
expcting
a
heavily
malted
ale
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
fruit
favors
as
i
tend
to
shy
away
from
those
types
of
beers
not
sure
why
but
they
just
never
sounded
like
they
would
be
this
darn
good
grateful
for
the
experience
but
not
sure
i
could
drink
this
in
quantity
definitely
worth
a
try
very
dry
and
easy
to
take
another
sip
a
good
beer
overall
just
wish
the
flavor
was
as
complex
and
fun
as
the
aroma
overall
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
pleasantly
tart
and
dry
o
a
superb
beer
and
a
great
example
of
this
brewerys
genius
reminiscent
of
an
oud
bruin
but
with
great
oak
flair
everything
was
of
the
highest
quality
and
even
the
burps
it
produced
were
smooth
and
delicious
i
bought
mine
at
a
bar
and
even
marked
up
at
15
for
a
25
4
oz
bottle
it
was
a
great
deal
if
you
dont
mind
a
beer
with
moderate
sweetness
and
are
ready
to
change
your
mind
about
sam
adams
as
a
brewery
after
trying
their
supermarketavailable
beers
then
try
this
one
out
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
dark
copperbrown
color

of
an

and
good

smells
of

oak
sweet
malt
hint
of
hops
yeast
slight
citrus
and
sourness
fits
the
style
of
an
american
wild
ale
mouth
feel
is
sour
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of

hint

slight

overall
great
appearance

body
and
blend
the
complexity
it
vast
but
the
carbonation
level
is
too
high
o
my
favorite
samuel
adams
brew
and
its
not
like
i
havent
given
them
shots
ive
had
nearly
20
different
styles
but
only
found
23
really
worth
reviewing
this
is
a
samuel
adams
ill
buy
every
time
i
see
it
and
thats
a
shock
for
me
but
in
regards
to
this
good
beer
its
very
tasty
and
not
something
that
should
be
overlooked
plus
its
not
like
we
have
a
lot
of
wild
ales
floating
about
here
at
home
this
is
one
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
again
its
a
favorite
of
mine
overall
i
do
not
think
this
is
a
beer
i
would
ever
seek
out
for
personal
enjoyment
or
for
any
reason
other
than
snobbing
over
that
being
said
i
feel
this
is
a
very
important
notch
in
the
belt
for
any
aspiring
beer
snob
if
it
is
available
in
your
area
and
you
have
not
had
it
i
highly
recommend
it
simply
for
the
experience
kind
of
tast
like
a
wineish
kinda
beer
deffinatley
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
not
over
powering
light
carbonation
easy
to
drink
only
thing
i
didnt
like
about
it
was
the
fact
it
didnt
have
as
much
of
that
beer
taste
than
it
did
some
sort
of
wine
d
an
interesting
brew
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
the
aroma
is
world
class
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
intriguing
but
no
better
than
slightly
above
average
another
interesting
offering
from
the
samuel
adams
barrel
room
collection
curious
bas
will
find
this
interesting
enough
but
im
not
sure
its
something
i
would
invest
in
again
in
the
future
pours
a
deep
clear
reddish
color
with
a
thin
head
which
quickly
recedes
to
nothing
no
lacing
or
no
lines
are
left
the
aroma
is
of
dark
tart
cherries
that
is
a
hint
of
oak
and
a
little
pepper
the
taste
follows
suit
there
is
a
dark
tart
cherry
flavor
up
front
to
start
the
middle
gets
a
little
watery
and
the
end
finishes
with
an
oak
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
slightly
stingy
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
the
tart
flavors
are
not
as
rounded
out
as
i
hoped
o
it
is
a
good
beer
not
exactly
what
i
think
of
when
described
as
belgian
drinkability
its
a
very
smoot
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
its
dryness
and
balsamic
notes
arent
as
pronounced
as
the
classic
versions
of
rodenbach
it
does
side
with
some
of
the
more
careful
versions
like
cuvee
des
jacobins
rouge
steenbergs
monks
cafe
and
bacchus
but
without
the
authentic
belgian
rusticity
well
call
sam
adams
version
a
flanders
red
on
training
wheels
overall
another
great
brew
from
sam
adams
i
would
buy
this
one
again
nice
bubbly
mouth
though
subtle
its
crispness
brings
the
flavors
to
the
forefront
slightly
tart
at
the
onset
but
with
a
sweet
kick
on
the
finish
lightly
drying
from
the
oak
vinous
grapes
cherry
brown
sugar
a
little
acidic
on
the
back
end
but
this
is
a
really
mild
sour
i
liked
it
though
a
decent
one
to
covert
the
curious
o
flavorful
and
dangerously
drinkable
beer
my
wife
and
i
both
enjoyed
this
overall
coming
into
this
to
be
quite
honest
i
had
no
clue
what
to
really
expect
upon
first
taste
it
was
actually
an
enjoyable
experience
the
wild
fruits
definitely
balanced
out
the
sour
tart
interesting
great
sipping
beer
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
i
may
try
again
but
would
be
pretty
stern
with
a
friend
when
it
came
to
recommending
it
my
girlfriend
did
not
enjoy
it
so
beware
for
those
looking
for
a
hoppy
bitter
beer
cheers
o
this
is
ok
but
a
bit
disappointing
due
to
kind
of
a
bland
body
overall
the
fruit
and
oak
is
there
but
just
kind
of
muddled
together
this
is
the
last
of
the
three
barrel
aged
sam
adams
beers
i
bought
the
other
day
this
stony
brook
red
has
a
really
nice
red
color
the
smell
is
sweet
and
dry
the
flavor
is
also
sweet
and
sourish
all
three
of
these
beer
have
had
dry
sweet
wine
characteristics
but
this
one
to
me
was
the
most
close
to
a
sherry
its
really
dry
and
sweet
this
beer
is
a
very
interesting
drink
i
love
the
experimentation
that
has
been
going
on
in
the
beer
world
and
this
barrel
aged
stony
brook
is
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
other
good
results
the
experiments
have
yielded
sweet
and
winelike
this
is
a
fun
and
enjoyable
beer
clear
and
red
in
color
with
no
notable
foam
the
cork
literally
exploded
out
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
of
fruit
wood
and
funk
tart
candies
and
cabernet
must
and
some
subtle
malt
firm
mouthfeel
lasting
finish
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nice
overall
tasty
easy
to
sip
on
but
i
can
see
how
someone
would
argue
its
a
bit
lacking
however
its
still
damn
good
and
i
enjoy
it
very
much
o
this
was
good
i
wonder
how
more
age
would
affect
it
i
dont
care
much
for
sam
adams
but
this
was
actually
pretty
good
its
a
hybrid
of
several
types
but
regardless
its
a
good
sipper
nice
abv
and
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
sweet
and
sourtart
but
never
over
the
top
pours
a
faintly
hazy
orange
brown
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
top
smells
of
dark
fruits
cherries
brown
sugar
a
bit
of
funk
some
lactic
and
a
hint
of
balsamic
the
flavor
is
sweeter
than
i
anticipated
but
serviceable
lots
of
dark
pitted
fruits
with
brown
sugar
and
a
fair
amount
of
funk
light
citric
tartness
with
a
bit
vinegar
rounds
out
the
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
lightly
acidic
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
east
drinking
beer
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
wild
ale
tasty
but
maybe
we
should
label
this
as
a
gateway
wild
brew
more
challenging
than
their
new
world
tripel
and
other
big
sa
specialty
brews
but
for
the
funky
sour
beer
seeker
really
lovely
for
others
challenging
at
a
minimum
buyer
beware
i
am
impressed
with
this
series
sam
adams
is
such
a
pioneer
in
this
industry
to
bring
variety
and
affordability
in
a
time
when
so
many
micro
breweries
are
making
super
expensive
and
rare
hard
to
get
beers
they
are
a
refreshing
go
to
brewery
i
only
paid
4
49
for
this
easy
to
get
and
affordable
we
need
more
like
this
i
really
thought
id
like
this
more
than
i
actually
did
glad
i
dont
feel
like
i
need
to
buy
more
bottles
an
okay
introtobelgian
red
ale
for
those
who
have
never
had
any
flemish
ales
yet
better
put
maybe
a
good
introtobelgians
for
those
who
have
never
had
a
belgian
beer
yet
d
this
was
a
nice
flanders
red
but
not
in
the
top
tier
the
scent
and
taste
were
good
but
not
terribly
bold
complex
or
delicate
the
body
was
only
ok
also
but
the
finish
was
very
smooth
so
it
was
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
maybe
age
will
help
improve
only
average
for
the
style
fresh
well
done
engaging
and
fairly
complex
not
the
best
flemish
red
ive
had
but
unique
and
tasty
a
surprisingly
good
sour
from
sam
and
a
good
value
excellent
nose
and
while
the
flavor
was
good
is
didnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
this
isnt
a
sour
beer
its
tart
and
has
its
own
complexities
a
good
price
for
the
style
of
beer
will
make
me
buy
alot
more
overall
served
at
50
f
and
was
a
little
bozy
and
tart
for
me
however
a
very
good
beer
a
great
american
belgian
congratulations
sam
along
with
their
tripel
stony
brook
red
is
another
sam
adams
barrel
room
collection
offering
that
holds
its
own
against
wellentrenched
belgian
offerings
while
not
among
their
equals
its
quite
tasty
and
worthy
of
praise
overall
fairly
close
to
the
belgian
standards
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
decent
beige
head
there
is
a
decent
scent
of
yeast
and
fruits
the
taste
is
very
belgian
with
a
complex
mixture
of
citrus
other
fruits
and
yeast
the
texture
is
quite
nice
and
very
this
beer
makes
for
very
easy
drinking
very
smooth
and
well
made
from
notes
strong
b
8586
nice
color
and
appearance
it
tasted
more
like
a
barley
wine
but
i
could
attribute
that
the
the
barrel
aging
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
it
to
be
but
it
was
a
good
beer
i
was
thining
it
would
have
more
of
a
abbey
style
taste
with
a
big
sour
punch
but
the
punch
was
more
of
a
oak
aged
flavor
the
first
sip
brough
to
mind
a
real
oaky
wine
flavor
i
might
try
this
again
with
some
friends
i
dont
think
it
was
meant
to
be
served
in
a
14
oz
glass
a
solid
effort
by
sam
but
be
prepared
it
is
real
real
boozy
pours
a
deep
saturated
mahogany
hue
mild
carbonation
yields
a
thin
khaki
head
light
balanced
tartness
with
a
sneaky
musky
funkiness
poking
through
the
base
beer
is
a
big
smooth
amber
ale
warm
toasted
and
caramelly
big
coarse
woody
oak
note
on
the
finish
that
is
a
bit
jarring
at
the
beginning
but
is
really
quite
pleasant
when
its
all
said
and
done
really
smooth
at
9
abv
dont
expect
a
traditional
flanders
red
the
sourness
is
pretty
subdued
but
there
is
plenty
of
complexity
and
the
big
maltiness
and
9
abv
make
it
a
nice
sipper
a
great
value
at
4
99750ml
enjoyable
enough
to
convince
me
to
try
the
other
2
beers
in
the
barrel
room
series
tart
and
sour
flavors
are
on
the
lighter
side
the
taste
especially
the
aftertaste
has
a
medicinal
sweety
yes
throat
lozenge
quality
an
interesting
brew
and
great
to
see
another
american
brewer
giving
a
swing
at
this
style
but
not
something
ill
be
picking
up
again
pretty
impressed
by
this
one
not
great
but
tartness
and
funkiness
are
balanced
with
a
lot
of
oak
i
wish
it
were
a
tad
less
sweet
but
otherwise
solid
effort
i
liked
this
beer
very
drinkable
as
the
tartness
isnt
overwhelming
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
helps
to
cut
the
carbonation
and
make
this
a
nice
drink
bottle
poured
a
deep
reddish
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
tart
notes
with
hint
of
cherries
and
light
oak
notes
taste
is
a
low
acidity
mix
between
tart
cherries
with
light
oak
notes
and
subtle
vinous
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
easy
drinking
sour
with
some
complexity
beer
is
medium
bodied
through
and
through
with
modest
carbonation
creating
a
smooth
slightly
foamy
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
with
very
little
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
i
keep
finding
this
beer
on
the
shelf
at
a
price
way
too
cheap
to
pass
on
so
i
keep
buying
it
and
drinking
it
it
has
grown
on
me
considerably
it
reminds
me
of
beforethebestafterdate
dissident
i
am
nudging
the
taste
and
overall
scores
up
a
little
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
good
flavor
and
the
alcohol
was
well
disguised
overall
this
beer
would
make
a
great
introduction
to
belgian
sours
as
all
characteristics
are
subdued
and
smooth
this
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
flanders
red
a
nice
job
by
sam
adams
and
a
good
value
o
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
well
average
it
might
be
because
im
new
to
the
whole
sour
beer
or
it
may
just
not
just
float
my
boat
will
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
not
for
the
10
it
cost
me
i
could
pick
up
a
stout
or
something
more
enjoyable
to
me
overall
the
stony
brook
red
was
an
excellent
interpretation
of
a
flemish
red
ale
great
balance
between
the
tart
cherry
flavor
and
the
oak
vanilla
and
funky
brett
characteristics
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
sam
adams
regular
lineup
but
ive
always
mostly
loved
their
barrel
room
collection
this
one
is
no
exception
and
in
fact
might
be
setting
the
new
standard
for
the
brc
at
12
a
bomber
you
better
believe
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
guys
the
beer
is
copper
hued
with
crimson
highlights
and
a
soft
offwhite
head
the
aroma
offers
oak
sour
cherries
vinegar
red
wine
yeast
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
decent
a
bit
heavy
and
sweet
for
my
liking
though
the
finish
delivers
sufficient
tartness
lots
oak
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
a
heavy
flanders
style
brew
better
than
i
expected
id
like
to
see
more
offerings
like
this
from
samuel
adams
solid
great
blend
of
the
barrels
in
here
could
be
just
a
touch
more
sour
but
good
flavor
tart
right
up
front
and
a
bit
funky
i
taste
no
hints
of
a
barrel
but
i
get
that
it
was
wildly
fermented
it
transforms
into
something
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
malty
finish
moderate
body
lip
puckering
and
a
mediumlow
dose
of
carbonation
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
sad
face
the
beer
pours
a
deep
rich
looking
muddy
copper
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
dissipates
down
to
a
thin
blanketing
quickly
the
nose
is
fruity
with
specific
notes
of
bing
cherries
and
prunes
and
also
slightly
tart
there
is
a
distinct
acetone
that
lingers
on
my
olfactory
as
well
the
taste
is
surprising
as
it
hits
with
the
initial
sweettartness
of
an
oud
bruin
but
finishes
bitter
like
a
hoppy
red
ale
there
is
a
great
yeast
presence
and
the
beer
is
relatively
balanceddrinkable
with
my
simple
dinner
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
off
but
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
what
i
dont
like
i
would
recommend
letting
it
warm
a
touch
to
let
the
full
flavor
profile
shine
through
overall
this
is
actually
pretty
tasty
and
an
uncharacteristic
beer
to
come
from
the
standard
sam
adams
lineup
i
enjoyed
the
big
barrel
saison
as
well
id
like
to
see
how
this
beer
does
after
a
year
in
timeout
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
very
bubbly
nice
big
head
even
with
a
light
pour
smell
of
sour
cherries
i
really
wish
the
taste
was
more
sour
than
it
ended
up
being
it
was
only
slightly
tart
with
a
certain
belgian
character
coming
through
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
wasnt
amazing
really
nice
afterdinner
beer
deep
redbrown
ale
with
a
sudsy
head
aromas
of
cranberry
bread
and
spices
i
can
smell
the
oak
barrels
influence
as
well
tart
berry
and
spices
hit
the
palate
first
followed
by
nutty
whiskey
and
subtle
vegetable
flavors
the
flavor
is
complex
but
a
little
underwhelming
this
ones
not
as
enjoyable
as
the
barrel
room
stout
o
very
unique
and
super
complex
every
sip
left
me
guessing
what
was
next
sometimes
i
forget
that
sam
adams
is
a
real
brewery
because
of
their
commercial
appeal
but
this
beer
is
pretty
amazing
o
not
too
shabby
it
tries
to
be
a
flanders
red
but
as
a
wild
ale
it
gets
good
marks
nice
tartness
that
doesnt
overpower
and
good
depth
of
flavor
it
was
nice
to
try
this
beer
from
sam
adams
but
for
the
price
id
rather
snag
a
rodenbach
this
one
presents
just
like
a
typical
flanders
with
the
woody
backing
to
the
sour
cherries
and
mild
funk
with
gentle
acidity
and
vinegar
tartness
a
tiny
wisp
of
lactic
sour
but
very
little
funk
or
swamp
gas
to
it
which
could
potentially
change
with
cellaring
adjustment
it
also
suffers
from
being
about
15
too
sweet
imho
its
identifiable
as
an
introductorylevel
newbie
accessible
americanmade
flanders
but
still
a
lot
less
raunchy
and
wild
than
the
real
mccoy
from
belgium
if
i
see
it
again
in
the
stores
i
know
im
going
to
be
picking
up
another
bottle
or
two
to
see
what
a
year
or
so
of
basement
aging
does
to
improve
yeast
funk
and
tanginess
levels
its
got
the
right
amount
of
oak
wood
acidity
and
sourness
but
needs
some
more
dryness
funk
and
wild
yeast
character
give
it
a
shot
fresh
if
you
prefer
your
sours
woody
yet
still
semisweet
if
not
either
give
it
a
pass
or
try
to
see
what
happens
with
cellaring
it
overall
without
question
an
exceptional
ale
one
which
im
glad
boston
beer
co
decided
to
make
really
tasty
and
a
great
achievement
for
the
brewers
this
is
the
type
of
ale
that
i
hope
they
continue
to
brew
for
the
sam
adams
line
maybe
more
wild
ales
or
even
a
gueuze
in
the
works
why
not
theyve
done
just
about
everything
else
the
awa
is
a
tough
competitive
category
with
plenty
of
amazing
beers
so
i
have
to
rate
accordingly
however
dont
hesitate
picking
this
one
up
not
overly
complex
but
an
awesome
attempt
at
a
flanders
red
from
sam
adams
the
sour
factor
is
very
light
the
9
0
abv
is
well
masked
would
have
loved
for
this
to
have
more
sour
power
with
some
heavier
oak
flavors
excellent
for
the
11
price
tag
o
wow
this
beer
has
me
delightfully
surprised
everything
was
great
maybe
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
had
i
will
be
purchasing
more
to
cellar
and
i
recommend
you
also
follow
suit
pours
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
a
slight
ring
aromas
of
tart
berries
oak
cinnamon
red
wine
vinegar
and
a
touch
of
funk
a
little
muddy
taste
consists
of
cranberry
raspberry
and
cherry
oak
vinegar
and
light
funky
yeast
much
like
the
nose
the
flavors
are
muddy
not
clean
wish
this
was
either
more
sour
or
more
funky
but
this
inbetween
mode
isnt
great
decent
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
decent
beer
i
suppose
and
i
applaud
sa
for
taking
a
risk
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
it
o
reminscent
of
a
kriek
lambic
or
flanders
red
the
oak
barrel
adds
a
bit
of
additional
complexity
that
makes
for
a
pleasant
pint
o
id
call
this
flanders
light
if
i
had
to
describe
to
to
someone
maybe
an
okay
introduction
to
the
style
but
clearly
not
a
standout
overall
not
up
there
with
the
top
beers
of
the
style
too
sweet
and
lacks
funky
complexity
the
beer
is
clear
mohogany
color
it
has
a
light
tan
head
with
minimal
retention
no
lacing
the
color
looks
almost
completely
red
when
held
to
natural
sunlight
the
nose
is
very
wine
like
lots
of
sour
grapes
and
cherries
up
front
its
also
got
a
nice
funkiness
to
it
again
very
winy
really
big
on
the
sourtart
cherries
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
kombucha
a
little
mono
tone
but
delicious
feels
good
on
the
palate
its
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
sorta
bubbly
a
nice
pick
a
good
pick
to
change
things
up
a
bit
the
cork
came
out
with
a
loud
pop
and
plenty
of
smoke
emerged
from
the
bottle
poured
into
a
large
brandy
snifter
pours
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
small
somewhat
quickly
dissipating
light
tan
head
theres
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
behind
and
some
visible
alcohol
legs
i
can
see
through
the
beer
if
i
look
through
it
from
the
top
as
opposed
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
smells
like
a
good
flemish
red
it
has
that
tart
cherry
scent
i
get
some
of
that
bready
and
sweet
malt
along
with
the
oak
i
can
pick
up
some
of
that
alcohol
as
well
but
its
very
faint
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
cherry
tartness
is
up
front
but
its
balanced
by
the
bready
and
mildly
sweet
malt
with
some
of
that
oak
flavor
theres
some
spice
in
there
as
well
the
alcohol
isnt
that
detectable
in
the
taste
its
incredibly
wellbalanced
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
fans
of
this
style
every
time
sam
adams
comes
up
with
a
new
line
of
beers
ive
come
to
expect
no
more
one
welldone
in
the
bunch
this
one
certainly
hits
that
looking
forward
to
the
others
though
o
surprised
and
impressed
with
this
one
it
was
quite
tart
and
sour
with
nice
wood
notes
a
nice
belgian
red
imo
what
an
exceptional
beer
without
a
doubt
the
best
ive
had
this
year
i
honestly
could
do
without
the
special
b
and
aromatic
malt
and
this
would
have
been
even
better
with
some
more
residual
sweetness
a
wellbalanced
sweetsour
beer
re
duchesse
is
to
die
for
but
as
is
this
is
heavenly
stuff
as
it
warms
up
and
the
carbonation
simmers
it
takes
on
a
more
enveloping
mouthfeel
and
the
malts
come
out
a
bit
more
a
beautiful
beautiful
beer
will
definitely
have
to
buy
another
couple
bottles
of
this
anyway
i
will
probably
not
buy
this
again
because
of
the
very
high
cost
it
was
good
a
very
interesting
foray
into
barrel
aging
the
closest
barrelaged
beer
ive
had
to
this
was
petrus
and
that
was
quite
different
however
its
not
quite
up
my
alley
enough
to
warrant
the
very
high
cost
of
this
beer
pours
deep
brown
with
a
tinge
of
red
and
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
about
a
half
finger
nose
is
tart
cherries
some
brandy
like
qualities
white
grapes
surprisingly
slight
vanilla
and
oak
plums
green
apples
and
just
a
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
is
less
tart
than
the
smell
grapes
cherries
oak
brandy
pears
and
it
finishes
on
notes
of
red
wine
sam
adams
attempt
at
a
sour
is
a
definite
win
i
havent
had
many
really
good
sours
in
az
but
this
is
finally
one
and
at
9
its
not
a
bad
deal
i
just
hope
plaza
liquors
gets
some
more
overall
this
was
good
not
as
tart
as
i
would
like
to
see
id
be
lying
if
i
said
i
wasnt
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
bbc
doesnt
wow
most
of
the
time
but
this
is
a
very
pleasant
very
well
made
enjoyable
wild
ale
and
well
worth
the
7
99
price
tag
overall
a
fairly
nice
sour
not
mouth
puckering
like
some
but
it
had
a
nice
balance
between
sour
and
sweetmalty
while
the
belgian
sour
is
not
really
my
style
i
believe
sam
does
a
nice
job
with
this
one
give
it
a
go
overall
between
the
three
i
cant
decide
what
one
i
enjoy
most
this
definitely
will
be
bought
over
a
more
expensive
lambric
when
its
not
payday
overall
is
this
a
wild
ale
or
a
flemish
red
anyways
it
tasted
very
good
reasonably
priced
too
10
a
bottle
delicious
and
enjoyable
pours
brownishred
a
tad
of
cherry
medicine
aroma
medium
bodied
decent
drinkability
it
seems
to
be
an
understated
balanced
out
flanders
red
very
woody
in
the
finish
not
complex
and
not
exceptionally
interesting
bottle
found
in
a
maine
bottle
shop
this
was
awesome
it
had
a
fantastic
nose
and
flavor
it
was
fruitforward
and
tart
its
simple
but
it
has
depth
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
if
i
can
find
it
again
ill
pick
it
up
o
great
beer
and
an
easily
accessible
take
on
the
style
if
you
have
never
tried
a
sour
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
start
with
the
9
0
abv
is
a
little
on
the
high
side
so
keep
that
in
mind
if
you
decide
you
like
it
and
want
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
by
yourself
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
hue
but
not
much
of
a
head
and
no
real
lacing
nose
is
sweet
flavor
is
bitter
with
a
lightly
sweet
balance
bitter
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
a
good
beer
to
take
to
convert
red
wine
drinkers
id
like
to
give
this
a
go
with
a
good
steak
or
traditional
country
french
food
this
is
my
second
foray
into
the
as
im
now
finding
criminally
underrated
sam
adams
barrel
room
collection
is
the
samuel
adams
name
on
the
bottle
making
people
underrate
these
anyway
stony
brook
red
pours
out
a
deep
red
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
reveals
layers
of
tart
cherry
oak
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
vinegary
funk
the
flavor
profile
is
similar
to
a
flanders
oud
bruin
with
the
tart
cherry
grape
and
funk
taking
center
stage
here
the
toasted
oak
comes
through
on
the
late
finish
bringing
along
its
buddy
vanilla
for
a
great
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
its
highly
carbonated
and
very
dry
the
drinkability
is
also
great
another
winner
from
the
barrel
room
collection
the
oak
on
the
finish
really
pulls
everything
together
for
me
its
integrated
so
well
at
nine
bucks
for
a
750ml
this
is
a
steal
o
this
is
a
solid
sour
actually
a
great
beer
concidering
its
a
sam
adams
this
in
perticular
isnt
my
favorite
sour
though
the
cherries
make
it
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
can
see
the
potential
in
it
a
flanders
style
red
isnt
my
favorite
sour
style
but
this
isnt
half
bad
i
only
paid
8
99
for
the
bottle
and
i
am
seriously
concidering
buying
the
rest
of
them
sours
are
hard
to
find
and
usually
way
way
way
more
expensive
overall
a
decent
attempt
by
sam
adams
that
i
must
give
them
credit
for
its
great
to
see
such
a
large
brewery
taking
the
time
to
make
a
wild
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
very
respectable
wild
ale
would
buy
this
again
if
this
became
a
year
round
seasonal
release
drinks
very
easy
this
may
not
be
the
best
or
most
complex
sour
ive
ever
tasted
but
as
far
as
the
price
i
dont
think
a
better
bargain
on
a
barrel
aged
sour
exists
anywhere
else
in
the
world
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
stuff
again
in
the
future
at
6
99
for
a
large
bottle
this
beer
is
a
bargain
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
flemish
red
ale
from
a
brewer
many
are
quick
to
dismiss
do
not
be
afraid
of
this
one
its
probably
not
sour
enough
to
please
diehard
fans
of
sour
beers
but
its
plenty
sour
to
enjoy
drinking
and
might
be
a
nice
way
to
gently
introduce
someone
to
the
wonderful
and
expensive
world
of
sours
o
i
like
acid
so
i
like
this
though
others
may
not
it
isnt
terribly
maltyhoppy
but
fits
the
wild
ale
style
well
o
it
was
ok
found
it
for
8
i
think
which
i
thought
was
a
mistake
so
i
didnt
really
have
high
hopes
for
it
overall
and
ok
beer
im
not
a
wild
ale
fan
but
this
is
ok
o
i
tried
this
on
a
whim
pretty
tastey
whim
and
this
is
my
first
sam
adams
anything
great
job
if
anything
would
like
a
higher
abv
an
excellent
american
flemish
red
delicious
kind
of
liefmansesque
o
glad
i
tried
it
different
but
tasty
a
great
ale
to
sit
on
the
back
porch
listening
to
the
rain
with
relaxing
if
youre
a
lambic
fanthis
is
a
pleasing
beginning
to
a
fine
sipper
notes
a
rather
complex
beer
but
very
tasty
lots
of
yummy
sourness
cheers
o
all
in
all
a
complex
and
interesting
beer
tastes
could
mesh
a
little
better
and
may
over
some
time
in
the
cellar
i
would
definitely
give
this
one
another
shot
oits
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
subtle
the
flavors
arent
strong
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
no
off
flavors
a
whole
bottle
is
easily
finished
by
one
person
to
be
honest
much
better
than
what
id
expect
for
a
wild
ale
from
sam
adams
overall
i
really
want
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
cant
i
mean
dont
hate
it
but
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
i
will
tell
everyone
have
a
glass
but
factoring
in
price
your
better
off
trying
something
more
suit
to
your
style
than
experimenting
on
this
if
you
dont
give

this
beer
almost
reminds
me
of
cough
syrup
its
easy
to
drink
and
sweet
with
lots
of
cherry
flavor
o
i
was
a
little
hesitant
about
this
beer
because
i
do
not
like
sour
beers
in
general
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
there
was
enough
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
sourness
i
wouldnt
seek
out
this
beer
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
4
0
overall
this
was
a
surprisingly
nice
brew
that
i
had
no
expectations
for
so
i
was
pleased
with
the
result
who
knew
sam
adams
could
make
a
decent
sour
the
nose
was
nicer
than
the
overall
flavor
profile
but
still
nice
nonetheless
a
very
nice
and
affordable
sour
in
the
realm
of
increasingly
expensive
and
hard
to
find
beers
of
this
style
def
recommended
if
you
stumble
across
it
i
think
its
only
available
in

at

with

and
a

i
have
to
say
that
i
was
quite
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
although
i
would
say
that
it
is
more
reminiscent
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
than
an
american
wild
if
i
had
to
guess
im
sorry
to
hear
that
this
beer
is
being
discontinued
overall
a
very
tasty
treat
of
a
wild
ale
if
not
a
particularly
wild
one
o
not
a
bad
take
on
a
flemish
red
from
a
big
american
brewery
they
were
out
of
stock
and
are
not
planning
to
make
it
anytime
soon
i
was
so
diasppointed
i
was
able
to
grab
a
couple
bottles
at
the
beer
store
on
my
way
home
but
what
am
i
going
to
do
after
if
you
know
where
to
find
some
in
the
boston
area
please
let
me
know
mouthfeel
is
live
and
bubble
with
crisp
medium
body
feel
and
just
a
bit
drying
in
the
finish
overall
sa
stony
brook
red
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
lineup
of
sam
adams
nothing
crazy
here
but
a
solid
wild
ale
with
a
nice
subtle
brett
character
all
for
under
10
not
a
bad
deal
at
all
o
i
want
to
use
the
word
approachable
but
i
dont
mean
it
in
a
patronizing
or
dismissive
sense
this
balanced
and
deliciously
quaffable
id
love
to
have
this
again
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
for
what
it
was
its
definitely
not
trying
to
compete
with
the
sourest
of
sour
krieks
but
what
tartness
it
does
provide
is
welcomed
this
beer
reallyshows
a
greater
complexity
and
skill
that
the
normal
lineup
of
sam
adams
may
not
convey
and
it
balances
the
barrel
nicely
with
the
cherry
tartness
poured
into
a
tulip
amber
color
small
of
white
head
light
carbonation
sweet
and
sticky
well
balanced
by
the
sourness
and
oak
the
oak
is
suble
and
enjoyable
the
alchohol
is
atrong
but
not
over
bearing
me
and
hammer
made
easy
work
of
this
treat
direct
from
the
brewery
tour
o
a
good
offering
from
the
folks
at
sam
adams
id
hit
a
steak
with
this
bad
boy
like
a
cab
sav
of
the
beer
world
hats
of
to
sa
im
impressed
notes
great
to
see
sam
adams
releasing
some
of
these
experimental
beers
im
pretty
indifferent
toward
this
one
though
o
the
sourness
balances
the
fruitiness
very
nicely
i
would
drink
this
again
it
would
go
great
with
grilled
fish
d
overall
a
nice
wild
ale
a
bit
overpriced
and
sour
for
my
tastes
but
quite
good
for
the
style
dr
high
price
relatively
high
abv
and
good
quality
make
this
beer
one
to
try
but
not
to
savor
id
have
it
again
but
i
do
wish
the
price
was
better
overall
this
is
a
cool
beer
received
as
a
gift
from
my
sister
well
appreciated
and
id
like
to
have
this
beer
again
pours

with
a
small
12
inch
whitered
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
spots
of
lacing
slowly
drip
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
smell
is
of
sour

vinegar
and
funkmust
a
very
mouthwatering
smell
taste
is
of
sour
berries
red
winebalsalmic
vinegar
and
the
funkmust
flavor
that
wild
ales
have
very
tasty
and
refreshing
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
wild
ale
and
i
like
this
much
better
than
the
american
kriek
beer
from
the
barrel
room
collection
i
tried
a
few
days
ago
do
very
rich
and
thick
drinkable
but
best
when
sipped
slowly
strong
and
balanced
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
snifter
glass
it
has
a
dark
red
body
with
not
a
lot
of
head
to
it
no
lace
either
the
smell
is
funky
of
tart
cherries
and
of
toasted
malt
the
first
sip
is
like
wow
tart
cherries
threw
the
sip
then
it
a
little
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
has
some
carbonation
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
barrel
room
collectionthey
are
sitting
in
my
beer
cupboard
pretty
good
for
a
wild
ale
not
exactly
what
you
would
expect
to
get
from
belgium
but
this
is
good
in
its
own
right
the
stoney
brook
red
was
part
of
a
three
pack
i
bought
up
at
the
brewery
last
summer
when
i
was
there
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
really
nice
red
color
with
a
good
amount
of
pinkish
tan
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
isnt
as
funky
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
there
is
some
of
the
wild
yeast
aromas
that
come
though
but
there
are
some
fermented
fruits
and
a
malt
aroma
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
fairly
active
its
lighter
bodied
than
the
color
would
make
you
think
the
beer
finishes
a
little
dry
but
not
really
sour
or
overly
tart
like
i
was
thinking
it
would
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
love
the
idea
of
this
feels
like
a
funky
and
bitter
flanders
red
missing
much
of
the
fruit
a
fun
one
to
try
and
priced
right
i
like
i
like
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
here
heres
to
hoping
the
other
two
barrel
room
beers
are
just
as
good
cheers
drinkability
is
good
this
is
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
beers
ive
had
to
date
the
9
abv
is
well
masked
and
the
overall
beer
is
well
done
id
like
to
see
them
continue
with
similar
projects
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
clear
red
with
a
dense
beige
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
the
nose
is
surprisingly
good
its
like
an
oxidized
version
of
new
glarus
fruit
beer
with
cherries
vanilla
vinegar
and
a
surprisingly
oxidized
wine
character
the
palate
has
similar
flavors
with
the
oxidized
vinegar
and
wine
being
quite
noticeable
however
it
is
still
very
good
with
the
cherries
lending
an
appropriate
brightness
and
the
vanilla
is
nice
as
well
reasonably
wellput
together
this
is
a
nice
beer
tannins
are
low
and
the
tartness
is
nice
maybe
i
am
missing
something
but
with
some
great
sour
beers
out
there
this
is
not
my
first
choice
mouthfeel
is
fine
some
gentle
carbonation
reminding
your
palette
of
the
slightly
winelike
body
and
character
of
the
beer
dry
and
some
slick
sweetness
leftover
drinkability
with
some
caveats
is
pretty
good
first
the
beer
needs
some
time
to
loose
some
of
its
edge
after
opening
its
too
intense
initially
to
really
be
all
that
enjoyable
second
i
dont
find
wild
ales
in
general
to
be
particularly
high
in
terms
of
drinkability
when
i
try
to
rate
it
objectively
this
example
became
quite
mellow
and
easy
drinking
after
some
time
but
the
sole
glass
i
poured
was
more
than
enough
for
the
night
seal
the
bomber
and
save
it
for
another
deserving
night
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
deep
amber
pour
red
highlights
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
or
sweet
and
tart
cherries
with
a
dash
of
vinegar
the
cherries
are
the
main
taste
midpalate
some
vinegar
it
finishes
dry
and
tart
the
beer
is
light
and
effervescent
for
a
sour
it
drinks
pretty
easy
imo
more
of
a
flanders
red
a
little
more
sweetness
than
some
other
sours
but
it
works
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
it
isnt
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
serving
type
22
oz
bottle
d
the
sourness
of
this
beer
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
as
i
tend
to
prefer
dry
stouts
or
bitter
dipas
other
than
that
though
its
a
drinkable
beer
for
9
poured
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
figured
it
was
appropriate
for
this
poured
a
pinkish
amber
body
with
frothy
white
head
that
builds
quickly
and
fades
almost
immediately
smells
like
cherries
and
apples
with
a
tart
vinegar
twang
very
earthy
and
yeasty
too
taste
is
granny
smith
apple
skin
with
dark
fruits
horse
blanket
and
bready
grains
oak
pulls
through
nicely
sweet
and
acidic
but
gets
kind
of
overly
funky
in
the
aftertaste
and
an
oddly
bitter
finish
feels
light
in
body
and
crisp
due
to
high
carbonation
drinks
easy
especially
for
a
9
beer
flavorful
and
a
good
interpretation
by
sam
adams
but
not
anywhere
near
as
good
as
rr
or
other
popular
sours
best
out
of
the
barrel
room
collection
without
a
doubt
but
i
dont
think
ill
really
seek
this
one
out
again
i
might
reconsider
that
if
only
to
see
what
some
age
in
the
bottle
does
to
it
however
d
decent
brew
but
definitely
not
the
style
sam
adams
is
known
for
but
its
alright
good
fruit
notes
but
not
overly
exciting
the
body
is
medium
with
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
and
a
fairly
mild
amount
of
sourness
the
oak
is
there
but
its
not
particularly
tannic
this
is
a
good
brew
and
a
step
in
the
right
direction
personally
i
would
love
for
sam
adams
to
nail
this
style
and
get
a
bit
more
exposure
for
this
type
of
brew
this
is
much
better
than
i
expected
to
say
the
least
d
interesting
but
not
my
favorite
750ml
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
bottle
number
850
pours
a
translucent
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
like
sour
fruit
tastes
brilliantly
sour
with
lemon
grapefruit
and
pithy
notes
medium
bodied
and
effervescent
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
size
awesome
stony
brook
red
is
a
good
attempt
by
sam
adams
but
leaves
me
wanting
more
from
it
the
nose
is
very
good
but
the
taste
overall
is
weak
on
most
accounts
the
drinkability
is
fairly
high
on
this
one
if
you
would
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
that
is
this
one
isnt
bad
by
any
means
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
not
for
10
pours
a
thick
cream
three
fingered
head
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
layer
should
be
poured
slowly
and
leaves
a
good
lace
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
color
is
hazy
amber
tart
fruit
nose
flavor
is
tart
fruit
and
oak
the
higher
abv
is
hidden
clean
dry
finish
pricey
at
11
95
for
a
caged
and
corked
black
750ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
d
the
sweetness
and
tartness
really
give
this
beer
a
decent
range
of
flavors
that
you
taste
in
the
beer
the
beer
is
overall
really
smooth
and
crisp
and
fairly
refreshing
i
like
the
crazy
wild
and
sharp
flavors
from
the
wild
yeast
addition
but
theres
little
else
going
on
here
which
keeps
the
complexity
down
a
winner
in
the
wild
ale
category
bottle

thanks
to
speakorspasm
for
sharing
this
the
aroma
is
a
touch
musty
like
an
old
towel
at
first
but
then
it
cleared
up
and
let
the
cherries
vanilla
and
oak
toast
through
its
a
bit
muted
for
the
strength
of
the
beer
though
its
definitely
a
sour
beer
but
the
tang
isnt
that
ripping
it
reminds
me
a
touch
of
the
odell
woodcut
beers
and
thats
a
good
thing
theres
a
dry
tart
fruity
undertone
to
the
beer
i
really
like
with
a
very
light
earthy
farm
character
check
this
out
if
you
can
a
solid
wild
ale
a
little
one
noted
and
unrefined
but
a
good
effort
from
a
great
brewery
3
5
d
not
bad
but
nothing
special
either
id
prefer
this
to
either
be
sweeter
and
more
fruity
or
more
sour
its
in
the
middle
and
seems
a
bit
muddled
a
lot
of
my
scores
were
borderline
so
this
is
a
bit
better
than
my
rating
suggests
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
boston
beers
attempt
at
wild
ales
it
was
pleasant
slightly
tart
with
nice
oak
notes
nothing
too
special
but
solid
and
i
might
have
it
again
sometime
d
this
is
a
poor
mans
supplication
but
its
still
pretty
damn
good
id
love
to
see
sam
adams
release
more
sours
they
did
a
good
job
here
my
favorite
of
the
barrel
room
collection
im
pretty
happy
with
this
one
id
say
its
my
favorite
by
far
from
the
three
brc
brews
very
much
along
the
lines
of
an
above
average
flanders
red
the
9
00abv
is
not
really
detected
the
taste
is
good
but
thin
oddly
of
the
barrel
room
collection
this
is
probably
the
flavor
that
i
would
like
best
except
for
the
mustiness
the
thinness
of
it
though
just
kils
it
for
me
taste
is
actually
a
bit
disappointing
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
a
little
tart
but
not
too
much
nice
smooth
oak
hint
of
cherries
and
hat
is
all
seems
like
boston
just
tried
to
dip
a
foot
in
the
sour
category
and
see
what
it
was
all
about
this
has
a
lot
of
potential
and
so
does
the
brewery
in
this
style
that
is
obvious
in
the
taste
but
the
stopped
short
to
try
harder
to
appease
the
masses
so
they
could
say
hey
this
sour
isnt
bad
taste
is
meh
d
if
i
wanted
sangria
seriously
though
not
bad
it
just
didnt
impress
me
much
the
9
0
abv
was
well
hidden
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
little
now
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
i
am
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
a
bottle
of
it
a
beer
that
is
not
over
the
top
sour
but
really
balanced
between
the
sour
oak
and
fruits
this
is
just
excellent
well
done
sam
adams
something
i
highly
recommend
overall
its
pretty
good
and
would
work
well
as
a
digestif
in
the
evening
before
getting
it
on
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
a
nice
move
for
sam
tartness
is
more
reserved
in
the
taste
than
the
aroma
lazy
dull
toffee
plum
and
nutmeg
settle
on
the
palatte
before
being
cast
aside
by
a
sharp
tart
companion
becomes
fairly
monotone
as
it
warms
and
not
unlike
sangria
and
nutmeg
md
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
on
this
is
moderate
nice
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
is
nice
would
have
liked
a
little
more
funk
and
sourness
to
this
though
part
i
of
the
sa
barrel
room
odyssey
get
some
it
pours
a
straight
clear
garnet
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
an
agglutination
of
foam
in
the
center
lets
me
know
the
laser
etch
is
workin
just
fine
the
nose
comprises
dark
tart
berries
sour
cherries
a
touch
of
vinegar
dark
wheat
oak
and
a
scraping
of
brett
the
taste
follows
upping
the
oak
ante
as
well
as
that
of
the
brett
and
sour
notes
and
tossing
in
a
pinch
of
salt
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
sturdy
medium
with
a
moderately
active
carbonation
and
a
rather
dry
finish
not
bad
overall
though
not
something
to
drink
regularly
d
i
like
this
one
a
lot
my
favorite
of
the
3
barrel
room
collection
beers
nice
fruity
and
sour
flavors
with
just
a
bit
of
funk
the
oakiness
is
a
bit
on
the
high
side
for
my
tastes
just
too
strong
in
the
flavor
and
seems
to
diminish
some
of
the
other
flavors
in
the
process
overall
quite
enjoyable
i
think
i
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
before
they
are
gone
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
flemish
red
overall
dont
listen
to
the
haters
poured
a
beautiful
dark
reddish
maple
almost
like
an
oude
bruin
nice
cream
colored
head
that
left
no
lace
vanilla
aged
wood
touch
of
tannins
leather
and
sour
cherries
are
present
in
the
aroma
and
taste
very
nicely
balanced
with
an
emphasis
on
the
lactic
tartness
prunes
hint
of
figs
and
cherries
a
different
but
great
combination
i
think
this
is
the
best
beer
sam
adams
has
ever
put
out
bravo
i
shall
find
this
again
d
a
decent
enough
sour
with
a
really
nice
nose
but
the
flavor
is
sort
of
bland
still
a
good
one
to
give
a
try
and
something
unexpected
from
sam
adams
taste
starts
with
the
same
full
tartness
slightly
sweet
in
the
middle
then
goes
back
to
the
tart
for
the
close
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
with
drinkability
being
okay
tart
and
cherry
make
the
experience
kind
of
onesided
would
want
more
malt
character
for
balance
drinkability
is
pretty
good
especially
considering
according
to
the
bottle
this
is
9
would
make
a
good
introduction
to
sour
beersales
though
for
9
a
bottle
there
are
probably
better
examples
available
d
i
will
say
it
did
hide
the
abv
well
the
bottle
itself
was
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
really
nice
looking
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
i
would
get
another
bottle
clear
coppery
amber
reddish
hue
with
a
quickly
dissipating
beige
head
that
left
a
thin
collar
and
smattering
of
bubbles
coating
the
surface
of
the
beer
a
bit
of
spotty
lace
tart
fruity
aroma
toffee
tobacco
leafy
earthy
mild
alcohol
cherry
and
acetic
acid
the
flavour
was
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
a
bit
more
acidic
character
and
citrus
bitterness
as
well
berry
tartness
caramel
alcohol
in
the
finish
fruity
and
earthy
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
nice
texture
pretty
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
this
was
a
really
drinkable
brew
to
me
i
easily
could
have
a
second
glass
a
quality
beer
well
worth
the
try
overall
a
pretty
tasty
strong
red
turned
wild
i
had
it
fresh
and
it
was
just
a
big
red
ale
so
i
gave
it
some
time
to
wild
up
before
reviewing
and
it
seems
to
have
gotten
a
lot
better
the
wild
tastes
are
starting
to
come
through
now
this
is
probably
the
only
one
worth
it
from
the
sa
barrel
room
collection

5
a
really
great
beer
i
was
very
surprised
by
it
really
all
the
flavors
work
very
well
together
stony
brook
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
comes
off
as
more
of
an
introduction
to
flanders
red
ales
than
an
american
wild
ale
just
enough
tartness
and
funk
to
keep
things
interesting
but
not
too
much
to
scare
away
newbies
if
you
tried
la
folie
and
thought
it
was
too
sour
for
your
taste
give
this
one
a
go
the
body
was
a
little
lacking
but
not
bad
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
again
not
a
huge
fan
of
sour
type
beers
but
this
one
was
definitely
worth
the
price
ive
been
quite
happy
with
the
whole
barrel
room
series
making
a
good
name
again
for
local
brew
superhouse
sam
adams
i
snagged
this
one
at
the
local
foodmaster
yep
a
supermarket
with
liquor
license
decent
beer
wine
and
only
getting
better
and
carpeted
i
wondered
what
kind
of
red
ale
it
might
be
like
a
bland
irish
red
wondered
what
the
waters
of
hyde
park
might
have
spawned
beneath
the
cork
cage
a
hearty
pop
of
the
cork
later
released
an
aroma
that
i
initially
took
for
spoilt
as
the
sour
funk
escaped
the
pour
was
a
wet
dark
red
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
of
2
fingers
that
soon
sunk
down
to
little
though
some
lace
stuck
around
throughout
the
aroma
definitely
pushes
the
funky
farmhouse
thing
evoking
cherry
ripened
green
apples
this
holds
true
with
the
flavor
sweet
tart
cherryrose
hipapple
with
some
hefelike
yeast
rich
malts
all
work
together
so
that
not
one
thing
overpowers
a
bit
lacking
in
body
and
mouthfeel
for
something
akin
to
a
belgian
farm
ale
but
still
mighty
fine
huge
thanks
goes
out
to
knifestyles
for
this
one
i
had
been
interested
in
some
of
sas
barrel
aged
brews
since
i
heard
about
them
and
was
very
happy
to
see
this
one
in
the
box
as
an
extra
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
very
large
tan
head
which
was
longlasting
and
left
some
sparse
lacing
on
the
glass
first
aromas
i
get
are
tart
apple
skins
a
bit
of
lemon
some
cherry
and
a
musty
basementlike
quality
as
it
warms
taste
is
somewhat
tart
barrel
flavors
are
there
wet
oak
etc
the
base
beer
is
solidly
noticeable
much
like
a
strong
brown
ale
with
some
caramel
and
breadiness
and
a
touch
of
tart
cherries
added
to
it
yet
the
cherries
arent
overly
predominate
a
little
bit
of
cheesy
funkiness
is
in
the
depths
of
this
but
would
really
like
to
have
more
acidity
and
more
cherry
flavor
becomes
a
bit
too
sweet
and
boozy
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
average
carbonation
a
decent
barrel
aged
wild
ale
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
that
description
is
pretty
much
standard
for
all
bbc
brews
not
bad
and
glad
i
could
try
it
i
like
sour
ales
so
i
really
like
this
try
it
if
you
can
the
barrel
room
collection
from
sam
adams
continues
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
pours
a
clear
amber
red
color
with
a
fizzy
yellowish
tan
head
more
than
a
finger
strong
that
receeds
back
almost
immediately
to
just
a
thin
lace
on
top
of
the
beer
nose
initially
seems
to
be
typical
belgian
phenols
but
gives
way
to
more
aromas
of
belgian
style
yeast
meets
spices
akin
to
clove
minor
amount
of
banana
and
then
increasingly
more
tartness
funk
fruit
and
then
an
ever
so
slight
bit
of
oaky
subtleness
as
it
warms
taste
is
tart
but
includes
some
musty
notes
fruity
apple
and
pear
clove
slight
bit
of
banana
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
and
quite
drying
with
the
drying
finish
comes
some
of
the
oak
and
woodsy
characteristics
in
the
taste
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
with
moderately
high
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
for
9
the
taste
has
that
nice
combination
of
sweetness
tartness
abv
and
cherry
flavors
there
is
a
touch
more
vinegar
to
this
beer
than
i
would
have
liked
and
for
that
im
keeping
the
beer
out
of
the
a
range
but
it
really
is
refreshing
sweetish
cherry
tartness
sweet
malts
floral
with
a
slight
mouth
puckering
acerbic
punch
the
wild
yeastiness
brings
the
vinegary
flavors
to
the
fore
i
think
the
yeast
needs
to
be
tamed
a
bit
flemish
reds
are
my
favorite
style
and
this
beer
certainly
doesnt
detract
from
my
preferences
lchaim
drinkability
a
very
interesting
and
complex
wild
ale
i
could
have
several
glasses
one
of
the
most
interesting
sam
adams
out
there
it
is
worth
the
price
the
sweetness
offsets
the
tartness
perfectly
i
think
i
may
get
another
bottle
just
to
age
sam
adams
continues
to
impress
me
the
fact
they
could
put
out
such
a
solid
brew
at
such
large
quantities
is
astounding
recommended
but
i
think
this
should
be
qualified
as
a
flemish
red
ale
but
wild
ale
works
too
considering
the
brett
character
an
interesting
beer
not
completely
classic
it
still
has
that
classic
sam
adams
were
pushing
the
envelope
but
dont
want
to
go
to
far
as
to
offend
taste
i
hate
saying
that
but
with
the
exception
of
utopias
or
one
off
draft
beers
its
true
anyway
still
a
very
good
beer
kudos
to
them
for
pushing
into
this
750ml
barrel
room
collection
cool
idea
lets
see
what
you
guys
can
do
next
overall
im
impressed
and
the
price
tag
is
well
justified
in
this
brew
hope
its
not
too
limited
of
a
release
and
i
can
get
it
regularly
very
good
beer
nice
level
of
tartness
while
still
being
soft
enough
to
really
enjoy
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
strong
sourness
to
the
initial
taste
similar
to
belgian
gueuze
this
has
many
of
the
elements
a
strong
cider
including
a
green
apple
element
no
notable
hop
low
carbonation
with
a
full
body
too
rich
to
drink
regularly
d
a
nice
solid
wild
ale
perfectly
enjoyable
right
now
but
not
something
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
out
again
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
european
counterparts
but
a
nice
take
by
boston
beer
company
d
cant
get
enough
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
one
ill
only
reach
for
on
occasion
i
love
funky
flavors
and
i
wish
that
came
through
a
little
bit
stronger
dnot
at
all
what
i
expected
the
notion
that
its
a
red
throws
me
off
i
expected
something
more
malty
its
interesting
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
think
i
will
have
it
again
drinkability
i
can
foresee
comparing
this
to
an
ipa
as
being
similar
to
comparing
a
dessert
wine
to
a
zinfandel
i
definitely
had
no
problem
finishing
the
750
ml
bottle
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
well
maybe
not
quite
that
cuz
i
would
never
drink
a
750
of
a
dessert
wine
but
you
get
the
point
this
is
certainly
funky
but
after
having
some
of
russian
rivers
sours
temptation
consecration
etc
this
seems
a
bit
tamemellow
still
good
and
a
nice
intro
to
the
style
this
certainly
makes
it
more
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
good
for
the
style
this
is
really
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
actually
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
definitely
the
winner
for
me
out
of
the
3
recently
released
barrel
room
beers
750ml
bottle
8
99
it
looks
kind
of
like
a
flanders
red
reddsih
color
translucent
short
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
quite
interesting
off
the
bat
a
bit
of
funk
sour
fruit
reminds
me
of
the
dissident
the
flavor
doesnt
seem
to
match
up
with
the
smell
for
me
its
a
little
tart
but
mostly
mild
with
a
bit
of
woodiness
needs
more
sourness
more
funk
and
less
alcohol
overall
d
this
is
my
first
real
experience
with
this
style
and
am
pleasantly
surprised
not
filling
nicely
blended
the
balance
between
tartsour
and
malt
is
excellent
alcohol
is
undetectable
im
looking
forward
to
exploring
more
of
this
style
pours
a
deep
ruby
with
a
slight
swirl
of
head
hint
of
lacing
a
good
balanced
carbonation
follows
nose
has
an
immediate
strong
fruit
cherry
raisin
aroma
that
isnt
overpowering
taste
definitely
hides
the
abv
tart
but
not
fakesweet
llike
some
other
cherry
beers
very
tasty
refreshing
not
heavy
i
wish
this
was
available
everywhere
two
barrels
down
one
to
go
impressed
with
this
series
from
sam
adams
the
new
sam
adams
barrel
room
select
series
beers
just
hit
the
shelves
in
boston
today
and
i
have
to
say
that
they
come
in
some
very
handsome
bottles
i
ended
up
getting
this
and
the
american
kriek
probably
will
go
back
for
the
tripel
on
another
day
poured
in
to
my
new
lindemans
lambic
flute
the
color
is
of
rust
which
is
interesting
i
worked
up
about
two
fingers
of
heading
which
fizzed
away
and
faded
quickly
it
definitely
smells
like
a
wild
beer
i
get
plenty
of
fruit
some
degree
of
funk
smells
sort
of
like
sparkling
wine
taste
has
some
tart
cherry
apple
skin
barnyard
funk
and
little
touches
of
the
oak
here
and
there
it
feels
pretty
light
on
the
palate
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
furthering
its
similarity
to
a
sparkling
wine
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
taste
but
it
does
nothing
to
impair
the
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
here
from
sam
adams
the
price
tag
isnt
too
bad
the
bottle
is
nice
and
the
liquid
within
it
is
as
well
i
think
i
might
blend
myself
a
glass
of
this
and
the
kriek
at
some
point
tonight
cheers
to
sam
adams
for
experimenting
definitely
looking
forward
to
picking
up
some
more
of
this
amazing
how
well
the
9
alcohol
is
hidden
sam
adams
has
uncorked
a
surprising
and
delicious
beer
i
hope
the
rest
of
the
barrel
collection
is
this
good
i
will
definitely
be
back
to
the
brewery
before
this
one
sells
out
reminds
me
of
consecration
a
bit
and
honestly
if
i
had
to
pick
between
the
two
id
take
this
never
thought
id
say
that
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
ol
girl
handles
her
alcohol
content
so
well
you
could
put
an
entire
bottle
down
the
hatch
and
not
even
know
it
was
alcoholic
be
careful
d
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
this
would
make
a
nice
dessert
beer
slight
vinegar
some
rubber
bandband
aid
phenols
there
was
a
raspberry
seed
thing
that
was
not
so
bad
just
did
not
redeem
the
beer
not
quite
into
the
sours
yet
to
appreciate
this
i
thought
the
flavors
were
good
but
the
tartness
just
overpowered
the
beer
for
me
id
like
to
try
it
on
draft
to
see
if
it
would
change
my
mind
o
overall
this
is
one
damn
fine
beer
tart
and
sour
but
with
a
deepness
of
flavor
that
i
dont
often
experience
in
other
sour
style
beers
i
almost
wish
i
got
a
little
more
of
the
oak
from
this
but
still
pretty
damn
close
to
perfect
o
awesome
beer
great
combo
of
tart
and
fruit
sweetness
4
5
solid
wild
ale
big
raspberry
finish
low
b
o
delicious
enough
to
justify
the
price
point
would
not
be
difficult
to
finish
this
bottle
by
myself
despite
the
abv
this
would
be
a
brilliant
introduction
to
sourswilds
for
anyone
new
to
the
style
from
a
bottle
of
2010
vintage
2014
2
vintage
i
love
the
color
on
this
one
pours
a
hazy
magenta
with
a
small
and
quickly
dissipating
head
smell
is
raspberry
and
sour
lots
of
tart
acidity
tastes
less
sour
than
the
smell
but
its
still
a
strong
flavor
but
the
raspberry
really
shines
here
slighty
carbonated
and
very
smooth
this
went
down
quickly
nice
job
weyerbacher
perfect
blend
of
sweetness
from
the
raspberries
and
tart
loved
this
beer
fairly
impressed
with
this
one
right
now
certainly
captures
a
massive
raspberry
character
and
backs
it
up
with
hints
of
funk
and
lactic
sours
certainly
one
i
would
order
or
buy
again
the
thing
about
this
one
is
that
it
has
elements
of
a
flemish
red
that
vinegar
character
and
a
real
effervescent
carbonation
i
dont
think
the
fruit
is
as
forward
as
it
could
be
but
with
the
lighter
side
on
the
malt
i
think
it
shows
through
well
enough
it
certainly
isnt
sweet
and
it
definitely
isnt
artificial
in
any
way
super
tart
and
acidic
in
the
nose
citric
and
even
more
so
from
the
berries
wheat
in
the
malt
but
thats
not
all
i
cannot
believe
i
mean
i
absolutely
cannot
fathom
this
being
almost
12
abv
it
drinks
like
7
with
huge
carbonation
dryness
and
a
pleasant
fruity
thing
that
makes
it
feel
summery
and
light
where
does
it
all
come
from
i
have
no
idea
there
is
no
candy
sugar
character
or
anything
else
its
really
cool
fruit
and
vinegar
in
the
finish
and
it
tastes
a
little
like
salad
dressing
for
a
second
but
the
quality
is
through
the
roof
and
this
is
easily
the
most
complex
beer
i
have
had
from
these
guys
who
definitely
seem
to
be
getting
better
with
time
i
like
the
subtle
fruit
and
the
subtle
alcohol
well
done
mouthfeel
us
nice
with
a
rich
creamy
carbonation
excellent
american
wild
ale
and
use
of
fruit
not
too
sweet
or
overly
tart
falls
just
short
of
the
depth
and
complexity
of
the
finest
belgian
wild
ales
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
on
the
recommendation
of
both
bartenders
at
always
rons
in
hagerstown
they
absolutely
nailed
it
i
gave
it
a
perfect
taste
and
perfect
overall
as
i
could
not
believe
the
abv
unbelievably
drinkable
for
over
11
awesome
hope
to
buy
again
despite
the
cost
riserva
2014
hazy
reddishamber
pour
with
light
lacing
opens
up
with
a
wonderfully
bright
fresh
raspberry
aroma
and
flavor
fading
into
a
lemon
juice
and
lemon
peel
overshadowed
by
both
astringent
oak
tannins
and
alcohol
that
is
a
bit
unpleasant
the
raspberry
is
a
bit
sweet
but
is
not
immediately
apparent
given
the
acidity
this
is
one
of
the
most
acidic
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
as
a
sour
beer
lover
even
my
system
is
shocked
the
carbonation
is
active
and
prickly
the
mouthfeel
would
be
rated
higher
had
the
tannins
and
alcohol
not
been
so
harsh
riserva
has
some
marks
of
greatness
but
ultimately
it
is
not
very
drinkable
2014
riserva
i
simply
could
not
enjoy
this
beer
flavors
were
exactly
as
others
described
them
upfront
puckering
slightly
sour
fruity
then
the
oak
barrel
flavors
come
in
then
intense
sourness
then
it
fades
into
a
yogurt
aftertaste
separately
i
like
everything
about
this
beer
but
i
couldnt
handle
the
oak
and
sour
mixture
didnt
blend
well
at
all
for
me
worse
still
the
sourness
was
way
beyond
my
threshold
it
tasted
like
i
was
directly
biting
into
a
lemon
during
the
peak
the
flavors
definitely
improved
and
blended
better
upon
warming
but
not
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
it
2014
version
if
that
makes
a
difference
poured
a
light
and
cloudy
red
body
its
not
pink
but
its
not
basic
red
or
purple
either
with
onefinger
offwhite
head
and
left
lace
along
the
glass
aroma
is
comprised
of
extremely
tart
with
a
little
sweetness
raspberries
and
there
are
touches
of
sour
funkiness
smooth
balanced
and
that
is
key
as
this
could
have
been
a
mess
the
extremely
tart
and
sour
raspberries
also
have
a
touch
of
sweetness
especially
in
the
finish
so
you
get
the
best
of
both
worlds
and
not
just
a
flat
sour
mess
overall
this
is
very
tasty
with
a
great
raspberry
sour
flavor
may
be
slightly
one
dimensional
which
i
feel
is
an
area
some
of
the
more
extreme
sours
can
sometimes
fall
into
but
certainly
worth
picking
up
total
4350
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
really
like
it
but
thats
cause
im
really
into
wild
ales
if
you
like
wild
ales
its
definitely
worth
the
18
dollar
price
tag
picked
up
3
on
release
day
at
the
brewery
could
do
this
review
in
6
words
funky
raspberry
mouth
puckering
sour
bomb
really
not
much
else
to
say
except
what
i
also
like
about
this
beer
is
bang
for
the
buck
17
but
you
definitely
get
your
moneys
worth
at
this
abv
this
was
a
great
way
to
relax
after
a
delicious
saturday
night
birthday
dinner
with
my
girls
o
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worst
things
ive
ever
drank
so
pissed
this
beer
was
awesome
when
it
was
fresh
its
so
horrible
now
why
did
i
not
drink
this
fresh
it
is
however
25
a
bottle
and
thats
definitely
a
hard
sale
to
make
when
i
can
find
other
excellent
options
domestically
and
abroad
for
far
less
still
im
impressed
how
well
the
fruit
flavor
has
held
up
perhaps
improved
over
the
past
year
and
im
curious
to
see
how
it
would
evolve
further
and
find
what
would
replace
the
fruit
notes
as
soon
as
they
faded
off
absolutely
a
musttry
and
perhaps
once
again
if
youre
not
concerned
about
the
size
of
your
wallet
o
its
not
hugely
complex
but
the
beauty
is
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
the
weyerbacher
riserva
i
acquired
a
bottle
of
the
2012
from
a
friend
via
trade
been
sittiing
on
it
for
a
while
and
finally
decided
to
open
it
only
beer
im
having
today
the
cork
pops
open
pretty
decently
so
i
know
im
in
for
some
nice
fizz
the
smell
is
funky
with
raspberry
tannisn
and
oak
funkyness
half
digested
horse
manure
smell
ohh
man
this
is
funk
the
flav
is
amazingly
full
of
raspberry
kick
with
nioce
funky
lactic
tones
they
dance
on
tongue
as
this
beer
is
fizzy
as
the
beer
warms
the
heat
from
the
11
peeks
out
of
the
corner
of
the
raspberry
burst
superb
day
after
christmas
beer
soo
glad
i
kept
it
to
myself
lol
o
no
doubt
this
is
among
the
tartest
beers
ive
sampled
its
a
really
nice
bruteforce
sour
it
isnt
particularly
sophisticated
or
complex
but
it
brings
all
the
tartness
i
like
without
being
moronic
well
okay
its
a
bit
moronic
and
thats
exactly
why
i
find
it
so
charming
amazing
beer
poured
into
tasting
size
snifter
appearance
is
hazy
to
clear
amber
no
head
but
excellent
carbonation
fairly
standard
for
this
style
smell
is
all
kinds
of
sour
goodness
taste
is
acidic
tart
fruity
goodness
mouthfeel
is
amazing
front
to
back
the
fruity
sour
flavor
gives
ways
to
acidic
sour
dryness
on
the
tongue
overall
a
very
excellent
beer
worth
trying
over
and
over
this
would
pair
well
with
a
piece
of
fish
or
nice
fruit
and
nut
salad
highly
recommend
taste
is
spectacular
the
mix
of
sweet
ripe
raspberries
sour
tartness
and
barnyard
funk
play
beautifully
against
each
other
initially
the
sweet
ripe
raspberries
grace
the
tongue
followed
by
a
tart
zing
and
then
if
held
the
barnyard
funk
comes
into
play
the
finish
is
raspberry
for
minutes
the
ample
carbonation
helps
carry
the
tart
flavors
over
the
tongue
but
isnt
overdone
as
to
cause
excessive
carbonation
a
fantastic
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
sour
its
not
lou
pepe
framboise
by
any
means
but
it
definitely
brings
the
sour
and
raspberry
fruit
flavour
to
the
table
its
to
the
point
crisp
and
enjoyable
dangerously
so
considering
this
is
a
huge
11
40
bomb
o
while
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
beer
making
it
easy
to
drink
for
its
strength
it
is
not
a
beer
for
people
that
are
not
fans
of
sour
beers
as
it
is
quite
tart
it
seems
like
i
got
a
quite
tart
batch
and
it
is
enjoyable
o
a
kick
in
the
teeth
but
it
remains
enjoyable
this
might
cause
some
digestive
issues
if
youre
not
careful
though
odgreat
beer
always
wanted
to
try
it
but
i
didnt
want
to
shell
out
the
17ish
dollars
for
it
now
after
sampling
it
i
am
pretty
sure
i
will
be
purchasing
a
bottle
pours
a
murky
dark
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
malt
raspberry
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
super
sour
and
tart
raspberry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
high
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
super
sour
and
acidic
o
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
considering
its
strength
because
it
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
o
a
little
sour
and
the
teeth
coating
qualities
were
a
little
much
for
me
a
little
one
note
o
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
im
going
to
try
to
see
if
this
brew
will
benefit
with
a
little
age
on
it
too
o
for
the
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
wild
ale
for
someone
who
doesnt
normally
dig
on
sours
i
really
enjoyed
this
can
only
have
8
ounces
at
a
time
though
2011
bottle
little
get
together
with
a
certain
san
diego
bottle
share
group
originally
had
this
at
a
4
25
but
after
contemplation
and
realizing
it
was
11
4
abv
i
had
to
chiggity
check
myself
the
alcohol
was
hidden
too
well
i
would
have
guessed
7
75
at
the
most
maybe
8
if
we
were
getting
crazy
but
it
was
a
monday
night
i
digress
it
poured
a
pinkish
red
the
1st
round
but
got
murkier
towards
the
end
eventually
down
until
the
dregs
which
were
straight
brown
and
opaque
reaching
an
extreme
funk
the
smell
was
lambic
and
footy
wild
ale
for
those
being
pc
the
taste
matched
the
smell
plus
a
viscous
coating
of
raspberry
puree
not
super
tart
but
not
new
glarus
either
a
funky
raspberry
effervescent
wild
alesour
this
would
be
very
nice
as
a
vertical
onice
refreshing
wild
ale
with
nice
flavor
good
summer
beer
this
is
a
fantastic
wild
ale
it
has
tremendous
balance
deep
flavor
and
great
balance
the
oakaging
is
superb
as
are
the
raspberries
the
lactic
tartness
is
intense
but
almost
perfect
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
is
worth
trying
overall
thought
the
beer
was
great
and
would
definitely
get
again
but
next
time
i
might
share
with
a
friend
it
is
a
strong
beer
overall
a
very
very
fine
beer
weyebacher
has
done
it
again
all
of
the
flavors
are
complex
and
complement
each
other
very
well
despite
the
steep
price
i
would
definitely
buy
again
i
felt
the
sourness
was
a
little
too
overboard
and
detracted
from
what
is
otherwise
a
really
good
beer
o
the
reddish
pink
hue
gives
it
a
very
inviting
appeal
definately
a
beer
worth
aging
can
only
get
better
with
time
i
loved
this
beer
im
going
to
go
out
and
try
to
buy
some
more
bottles
id
love
to
see
how
the
brett
progresses
a
year
from
now
buy
this
if
you
see
it
o
while
this
beer
may
not
be
in
the
upper
echelon
of
wild
ales
it
is
quite
tasty
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
high
abv
count
this
one
as
another
offering
from
weyerbacher
that
has
impressed
me
2012
vintage
pours
deep
pink
with
a
small
bone
white
head
smells
like
chambord
raspberry
liquor
with
a
slight
bit
of
funk
taste
is
dominated
by
fresh
tasting
raspberry
with
a
slight
tartness
not
super
sour
with
a
little
bit
of
the
barrel
reminds
me
a
lot
of
blushing
monk
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
with
light
body
i
have
no
idea
why
i
passed
on
this
bottle
so
many
times
so
glad
i
pulled
the
trigger
and
bought
one
o
a
tasty
but
very
simple
raspberry
wild
overall
way
to
medicinal
and
just
doesnt
work
well
at
all
pretty
disappointed
with
this
one
others
may
rate
this
much
higher
if
this
type
of
beer
is
up
their
alley
unfortunately
this
style
was
overpowering
and
just
not
for
me
overall
excellent
american
sour
i
cant
believe
this
just
sits
on
shelves
in
some
places
it
doesnt
get
the
hype
that
some
of
the
more
popular
popular
sours
get
but
its
nearly
every
bit
as
good
pricey
but
worth
the
money
the
great
balance
between
fruit
and
funk
is
right
up
my
alley
and
it
isnt
at
all
boozy
given
the
high
abv
along
with
insanity
this
is
the
best
ive
had
from
weyerbacher
overall
great
fruit
character
but
not
without
its
flaws
in
the
sour
category
that
said
ive
enjoyed
my
sizable
pour
of
this
gets
better
as
it
warms
i
would
of
been
better
off
waiting
till
i
had
someone
to
share
with
not
that
its
bad
its
just
a
little
too
much
for
me
hopefully
it
keeps
for
a
day
in
the
fridge
bought
a
bottle
somewhere
in
pennsylvania
with
no
label
on
it
because
weyerbacher
labels
are
cheap
and
fall
off
an
amazingly
beautiful
wild
ale
with
some
kind
of
crazy
funk
smell
that
im
not
sure
i
enjoy
but
is
definitely
interesting
to
postulate
about
wonderful
sour
raspberry
flavor
and
a
strong
alcohol
presence
overall
a
great
wild
ale
but
that
smell
is
something
to
reckon
with
try
it
only
if
you
can
truly
handle
wild
ales
poured
a
rubymahogany
color
clear
at
first
hazier
as
it
got
closer
to
that
huge
trub
layer
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
a
few
stray
bubbles
formed
on
the
pour
but
there
was
no
real
head
to
speak
of
aroma
loaded
with
raspberry
and
funky
grass
blast
of
raspberry
up
front
in
the
taste
very
sour
with
a
salivainducing
acetic
acid
sensation
though
lacking
any
pulverizing
vinegar
flavor
underlying
berry
and
malt
sweetness
oak
and
earth
mid
to
endpalate
with
a
slight
subtle
grassiness
in
there
that
is
mostly
overwhelmed
by
the
tartness
of
the
raspberries
kind
of
hard
to
believe
that
this
had
been
mellowing
out
for
two
years
because
it
still
packed
a
mean
punch
contrary
to
some
other
reviews
of
this
i
cant
really
say
anything
bad
about
the
beer
i
thought
it
was
great
medium
body
low
carbonation
lacking
a
bit
in
crispness
but
nonetheless
a
great
sour
beer
overall
i
guess
the
abv
at
810
and
apparently
i
was
wrong
very
interesting
and
delicious
it
really
grew
on
me
the
more
time
i
spent
with
it
kinda
reminded
me
of
a
raspberry
kolacki
only
sour
this
was
a
disaster
not
sure
if
its
the
age
or
if
this
is
just
a
bad
beer
but
as
someone
who
usually
loves
extreme
sour
and
puts
vinegar
on
pretty
much
everything
its
too
much
for
me
a
big
disappointment
considering
how
much
i
love
rapture
as
well
o
a
great
sour
wild
ale
if
you
can
get
this
vintage
i
recommend
it
ive
heard
good
things
about
the
other
vintages
as
well
but
this
wasnt
too
shabby
o
i
mean
weyerbacher
did
throw
a
label
on
this
saying
it
was
more
tart
than
ever
the
acidity
is
off
the
charts
its
not
an
overly
pleasurable
experience
though
because
the
beer
comes
off
as
very
onedimenstional
a
disappointment
o
riserva
is
a
strange
and
interesting
beer
while
i
prefer
most
of
the
other
sours
ive
had
to
date
it
was
a
good
experience
to
try
such
a
big
one
in
terms
of
abv
and
body
its
considerably
less
sour
than
most
other
wild
ales
or
lambics
geuezes
etc
and
unfortunately
the
metallic
flavor
put
a
damper
on
my
enjoyment
of
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
nice
smooth
yet
tart
burn
throughout
the
entire
body
the
wild
yeast
is
intense
and
gripping
the
abv
is
very
well
balanced
though
gets
a
little
metallic
after
a
few
drinks
run
away
great
sour
overall
awesome
unclear
orangepinkish
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
of
fresh
raspberries
with
acetic
notes
oak
brettanomyces
and
light
earthy
notes
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
fresh
raspberries
moderate
tartness
acetic
notes
wood
earthy
notes
and
light
funk
alcohol
is
exceptionally
well
hidden
its
drinking
like
a
56
abv
raspberry
beer
dry
mouthfeel
almost
winey
at
times
low
to
moderate
carbonation
medium
body
a
really
good
raspberry
sour
ale
complex
and
really
enjoyable
o
this
is
one
of
the
sourest
sour
beers
ive
had
to
date
if
your
in
the
mood
for
some
really
mouth
puckering
raspberry
sour
deliciousness
give
this
bad
boy
a
whirl
im
still
puckering
pours
blood
orange
with
a
lightly
pink
thick
sheet
smells
of
sour
raspberries
some
oak
graham
and
lacto
flavor
is
sour
with
a
slight
sharp
sweetness
and
a
nice
grain
feeling
there
are
some
vitamin
flavors
as
well
i
like
the
flavor
of
this
one
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
this
beer
is
a
surprise
for
me
im
not
a
weyerbacher
fan
but
this
vintage
of
this
beer
is
good
ive
got
a
flat
2010
in
the
cellar
still
and
hopefully
its
nice
but
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable

the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
on
the
lower
end
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
american
wild
it
was
very
tart
and
sour
with
some
really
nice
fruit
flavors
i
do
think
it
lacks
some
of
the
depth
and
complexity
of
the
belgian
versions
but
for
an
american
version
it
was
pretty
good
overall
overall
i
was
not
disappointed
with
the
elusive
riserva
this
is
a
big
intense
wild
ale
that
has
become
highly
sought
after
the
flavors
make
this
offering
worthy
of
such
praise
can
stand
up
to
any
strong
flavored
cheese
its
paired
with
o
a
nice
american
wild
ale
glad
i
was
able
to
grab
two
bottles
of
this
o
i
believe
the
2009
might
have
scored
the
highest
but
they
all
had
their
high
points
they
were
such
different
beers
this
had
to
be
one
of
the
most
eye
opening
cellar
tastings
ive
done
i
absolutely
recommend
you
buy
this
drink
it
fresh
and
age
it
4
5
originally
reviewed
12292010
o
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
the
sourness
is
huge
and
it
works
would
love
to
try
a
different
vintage
but
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
this
one
again
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sour
beers
this
is
a
must
try
the
low
carbonation
would
normally
hurt
this
beer
but
the
tartness
is
just
that
good
o
i
love
this
beer
really
nice
wild
ale
got
the
farmhouse
funkiness
with
plenty
of
fruit
and
ale
nice
oak
background
with
a
long
jammyraspberry
finish
really
really
nice
drink
tasty
fruit
sour
just
wondeful
the
look
and
feel
bring
it
down
just
a
little
bit
but
this
was
delicious
and
a
sleeper
for
us
at
our
tasting
drinkability
for
11
i
get
no
booze
at
all
this
bottle
will
be
enjoyed
every
drop
possibly
the
most
enjoyable
fruit
beer
ive
ever
had
i
would
guess
its
peer
group
would
include
beers
like
blushing
monk
and
fort
this
being
easily
better
than
both
o
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
definitely
a
solid
stab
at
top
notch
sours
the
nice
twist
of
raspberry
puree
and
oak
give
it
some
complexity
that
is
welcomed
into
the
style
with
open
arms
as
the
beer
sits
and
the
carbonation
settles
down
a
bit
the
oak
comes
out
more
and
helps
smooth
things
over
a
little
so
does
the
alcohol
though
but
that
is
expected
with
the
abv
and
general
lack
of
body
that
comes
with
the
style
certainly
recommended
if
you
enjoy
sours
especially
with
the
price
point
i
got
mine
for
6
99
which
is
a
steal
for
a
sour
of
this
quality
pinkish

and
a
transient

tart

an
interesting
almost
cantillonesque
funk
but
generally
shittier
and
not
as
refined
or
exquisite
the
funkiness
or
whatever
it
is
just
seems
to
pull
this
beer
apart
really
in
disconnect
with
what
else
is
going
on
here
medium
body
with
a
sharp
and
abrasive
sournessacidity
not
impressed
this
vintage
aint
doing
to
well
at
this
point
after
having
so
many
top
notch
sours
lately
this
previous
favorite
of
mine
simply
cannot
compare
regardless
this
is
a
solid
american
sour
beer
cheers
newest
vintage
2011
i
believe
pours
a
very
murky
amber
color
with
a
slight
hue
of
pinkish
red
medium
white
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
not
the
prettiest
beer
thats
for
sure
scent
is
wow
strong
raspberry
pureejam
aroma
lovely
tart
berry
aroma
with
some
sweet
cherry
scents
as
well
slightly
medicinal
taste
is
initially
tart
berries
raspberries
and
strawberries
some
definite
alcohol
presence
some
maltiness
as
well
slight
cherry
coughsyrup
flavor
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
slightly
warming
alcohol
burn
in
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
fizzy
and
warming
drinkability
is
fair
overall
not
the
best
wild
ale
i
would
say
this
is
more
of
a
fruit
beer
with
the
lack
of
sourness
and
heavy
fruit
profile
by
no
means
is
this
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
very
interesting
would
have
loved
to
see
more
pucker
to
this
and
less
boozinessmedicinal
flavors
o
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
and
for
the
alcohol
content
its
got
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
but
still
plenty
mouthpuckering
tartness
for
those
sourheads
out
there
a
couple
of
downsides
are
the
slight
rubbing
alcohol
aroma
and
the
very
sharp
finish
however
if
you
can
get
past
those
this
is
a
pretty
good
sour
strawberrybrown
with
a
creamy
white
head
big
aromas
of
raspberry
oak
and
red
wine
vinegar
taste
is
similarly
tart
basically
raspberry
vinegar
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
mediumthin
mouthfeel
fairly
crisp
and
drying
not
my
favorite
brew
of
the
day
just
not
much
going
on
other
then
raspberry
and
vinegar
o
fantastic
beer
the
best
of
the
best
in
the
class
of
sours
really
surprised
at
how
good
this
one
is
bravo

the
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
light
tan
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
theres
a
small
amount
of

the

smells
like

apple

sour

oak
and
some

taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
the
sour

are
stronger
than
the
sweet
ones
not
that
im
complaining
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
good

i
think
this
is
a
good

definitely
worth
trying

a
bottle
m
very
low
carbonation
heavy
body
and
a
super
sour
sour
medium
to
full
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
is
remarkably
smooth
the
body
is
thick
but
silky
like
melted
chocolate
the
carbonation
is
fizzy
but
only
seems
to
be
a
help
mouthfeel
is
just
right
very
drinkable
if
you
can
keep
up
with
the
acid
overall
i
was
skeptical
of
this
beer
after
last
years
subpar
version
but
this
is
definitely
the
best
version
yet
of
this
beer
so
balanced
now
slightly
leaning
toward
the
fruity
end
but
with
time
this
will
develop
into
a
super
american
wild
ale
granted
it
will
never
be
up
to
the
quality
of
lets
say
a
cantillon
but
still
super
nice
for
a
domestic
example
im
a
huge
supporter
of
weyerbacher
beers
this
one
tops
my
list
for
them
no
easy
task
considering
how
much
i
adore
insanity
a
must
have
and
well
worth
the
17
99
paid
per
bottle
excellent
wild
ale
2010
version
reddish

and
a
small

very
gorgeous
funky
aroma
bold
tastes
lots
of
vinegar
with
the
raspberry
brett
made
for
a
balance
would
it
mellow
if
older
or
was
it
not
as
well
put
together
i
shall
find
out
from
2009
edition
decent
drinkability
for
sourheads
whatever
issues
they
had
wlast
years
batch
seem
to
be
gone
at
least
in
my
bottle
might
even
try
to
track
down
a
case
this
year
you
will
love
this
beer
i
heard
this
beer
was
good
but
jesus
i
didnt
think
it
was
that
good
this
beer
is
nearly
perfect
for
what
it
is
this
bottle
is
going
to
be
gone
in
10
minutes
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
wild
ale
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
disaster
after
having
a
pretty
good
experience
with
the
2011
version
a
couple
months
ago
i
thought
the
2010
version
would
at
least
be
pretty
good
i
was
wrong
it
was
a
completely
different
beer
the
2010
version
should
never
have
been
bottled
and
distributed
in
my
opinion
based
on
this
experience
i
will
be
passing
on
future
riserva
releases
o
awesome
beer
alcohol
is
a
bit
strong
but
that
is
my
only
complaint
tart
fruits
sharp
acidity
and
a
nice
sweetness
make
this
an
excellent
wild
ale
in
my
book
o
one
of
the
if
not
the
most
sour
beers
i
have
had
like
i
said
earlier
unique
this
is
the
2010
and
there
is
a
gold
sticker
that
reads
though
its
in
the
nature
of
a
wild
ale
to
be
different
each
year
this
years
vintage
is
exceptionally
different
and
may
not
occur
again
i
really
hope
it
does
riserva
2010
is
a
very
sour
ale
tarter
than
ever

about

if

sours
like
i
do
this
will
be
the
beer
you
hope
the
next
sour
you
land
will
live
up
to
overall
i
think
this
one
has
fallen
off
a
bit
perhaps
it
was
a
faulty
seal
on
the
bottle
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
posed
some
problems
for
it
it
is
a
sour
monster
though
so
if
thats
what
you
seek
then
look
no
further
no
carbonation
whatsoever
makes
this
a
slick
mess
funkiness
is
quite
gross
with
the
rasberries
too
big
and
really
messy
drainpour
o
wow
this
beer
has
gotta
be
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
having
the
way
it
comes
together
is
just
amazing
guess
ill
be
clearing
the
shelves
d
low
drinkability
for
the
average
beer
drinker
the
sour
lover
will
go
crazy
for
this
beer
o
very
good
each
flavor
sweet
sour
tart
and
funk
stand
out
well
and
transitions
into
the
next
seamlessly
if
blushing
monk
is
any
better
than
this
i
cant
wait
o
i
will
never
buy
this
again
nor
would
i
consider
sipping
it
again
this
is
not
beer
this
is
a
crummy
attempt
at
a
wine
overall
a
very
acidic
raspberry
sour
while
i
enjoyed
my
first
pour
of
this
there
is
no
way
i
could
have
finishes
even
half
of
the
bottle
when
i
can
kill
other
sours
no
problem
the
high
acidity
cuts
into
the
drinkability
glad
i
have
another
one
to
age
and
will
be
sure
to
have
a
few
people
around
when
i
open
it
o
not
worth
the
price
tag
but
this
is
a
very
solid
raspberry
beer
i
know
the
2009
vintage
is
tamer
than
the
2010
which
is
a
good
thing
because
this
was
a
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
the
summer
months
the
raspberries
leave
a
great
aftertaste
and
it
makes
me
want
to
keep
taking
gulps
to
get
to
that
reward
at
the
end
but
the
pungent
vinegary
taste
is
huge
and
you
should
be
ready
for
it
before
indulging
p
s
wait

review

bottle
pours
a
curious
ruddy
brown
very
thin
head
the
aroma
consists
of
strong
cider
vinegar
very
tart
raspberry
funky
yeast
oaky
earthiness
of
course
the
taste
is
incredibly
sour
but
i
bet
this
year
of
aging
has
made
it
much
smoother
than
if
i
opened
this
at
time
of
purchase
high
acidity
is
evident
it
has
an
alcoholic
apple
ciderwine
like
quality
to
the
mouth
feel
whats
remarkable
is
that
i
was
pondering
what
the
abv
might
be
as
its
not
revealed
on
the
bottle
now
that
i
know
it
is
11
4
i
am
astounded
because
it
is
masked
extremely
well
my
first
american
wild
ale
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
o
im
a
fan
of
sour
stuff
and
im
not
sure
it
gets
more
sour
than
this
but
it
was
a
very
good
kind
of
sour
i
really
enjoyed
this
weyerbacher
offering
overall
basically
a
big
boy
lambic
if
you
will
enjoyable
but
not
nearly
as
drinkable
oi
liked
this
beer
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
the
after
taste
is
a
little
off
it
is
sour
but
lacks
definition
honestly
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
totally
blown
away
and
shocked
by
the
low
scores
will
have
to
seek
out
another
bottle
fantastic
o
this
is
a
good
sour
and
i
would
pick
it
up
again
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
would
have
never
guessed
this
was
11
4
abv
this
beer
takes
you
for
a
ride
with
how
sour
it
is
o
a
world
class
sour
that
i
am
very
pleased
to
have
another
of
in
my
stash
overall
it
is
a
very
different
type
of
sour
its
not
about
flavor
it
is
about
making
you
pucker
i
like
this
style
of
beer
but
i
can
see
it
being
a
major
turnoff
to
those
who
dont
i
have
another
bottle
at
home
interested
to
see
how
it
will
age
o
great
drinker
very
pleased
with
this
one
o
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
most
sour
beerliquid
ive
ever
put
in
my
mouth
i
loved
every
minute
of
the
masochistic
torture
to
everyone
that
cries
this
is
too
sour
please
send
me
every
bottle
in
your
possession
i
will
happily
dispose
of
it
for
you
o
i
have
to
admit
that
this
style
isnt
really
my
favorite
ive
tried
to
rate
to
style
though
and
not
be
too
harsh
on
the
overall
score
weyerbacher
is
a
great
brewery
and
this
is
another
example
of
that
overall
some
sweetness
some
tartness
some
berries
its
not
quite
as
complex
as
others
on
the
market
but
its
still
reasonably
tasty
pours
a
light
brownish
red
the
aroma
is
all
sour
raspberry
the
taste
is
extremely
sour
its
actually
a
bit
too
sour
when
all
the
sour
and
tart
starts
to
fade
the
sweet
raspberry
comes
through
this
is
not
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
still
enjoyable
riserva
is
a
pretty
good
release
from
weyerbacher
but
is
definitely
not
a
release
for
everyone
if
youre
not
into
fruity
funky
beer
then
its
probably
not
for
you
im
into
funky
beer
but
not
so
much
fruity
i
guess
the
raspberry
presence
is
what
holds
it
back
a
little
for
me
its
not
bad
stuff
at
all
though
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
checking
out
a
newer
release
thanks

for

it
comes
with
a
warning
sticker
ffs
overall
its
kind
of
interesting
but
really
this
cost
twice
what
it
ought
to
and
was
no
more
interesting
than
other
sourwild
fermented
beers
more
intense
perhaps
and
maybe
tarter
im
probably
bitter
about
the
price
point
o
this
beer
has
qualities
of
a
bright
young
lambic
with
not
a
lot
of
depth
but
i
could
see
the
funk
starting
and
with
age
is
should
grow
although
11abv
might
slow
down
those
critters
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
lightly
carbonated
it
could
use
a
bit
more
fizz
but
that
isnt
going
to
fix
all
the
offputting
character
this
brew
has
it
boasts
some
serious
sourness
and
acidity
in
a
heartburn
inducing
sort
of
way
the
taste
is
off
quite
clashing
and
at
times
not
enjoyable
however
if
you
are
looking
to
have
your
sense
of
taste
wrecked
and
face
puckered
in
acidity
than
you
might
want
to
give
this
brew
a
try
or
rub
your
tongue
all
over
some
leaking
batteries
i
dont
even
know
if
it
is
worthwhile
keeping
one
of
these
around
to
see
how
it
ages
but
im
a
glutton
for
punishment
and
plan
on
giving
it
a
try
again
sometime
down
the
road
i
honestly
approached
this
beer
on
more
than
one
occasion
with
different
batches
and
an
open
mind
and
i
have
not
enjoyed
this
offering
despite
really
wanting
to
while
this
brew
might
not
be
an
enjoyable
example
of
an
american
wild
ale
for
everyone
it
certainly
will
get
you
buzzed
that
abv
level
is
excessive
but
equally
matches
the
other
bold
aspects
of
this
brew
the
folks
at
weyerbacher
should
keep
their
head
high
they
make
some
remarkable
excellent
brews
this
one
though
is
troubling
o
definitely
unpolished
around
the
edges
and
the
mouthfeel
could
definitely
use
some
work
but
the
flavor
is
good
and
the
acetone
isnt
too
distracting
thanks
again
josh
pours
a
reddish
gold
smells
of
over
ripe
fruit
very
tart
and
sour
on
the
nose
wow
this
made
my
mouth
pucker
and
my
eyes
water
literally
so
incredibly
sour
and
tart
didnt
taste
like
raspberries
to
me
it
tasted
like
crap
gave
my
pour
away
o
a
pretty
solid
brew
definitely
not
on
the
same
level
as
russian
river
but
its
tasty
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
very
sour
but
i
like
very
sour
beers
i
would
drink
this
again
o
very
good
in
each
way
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
overall
i
just
love
it
wild
ales
kick
ass
o
im
glad
i
witnessed
the
first
beer
so
sour
it
made
the
almighty
beerwolf
cry
this
is
so
acidic
itll
strip
week
old
blood
from
a
highway
of
even
the
messiest
roadkill
and
move
over
coke
thisll
dissolve
a
nail
in
seconds
ok
seriously
though
the
old
moldylike
raspberry
doesnt
do
it
for
me
but
the
sourness
does
and
damn
is
this
sour
as
hell
its
so
sour
its
almost
straight
from
a
nightmare
the
best
nightmare
ever
overall
easily
the
single
best
offering
from
weyerbacher
i
had
ever
had
original
review
this
beer
is
wild
for
sure
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
like
a
pinkish
hue
thats
a
bit
cloudy
sort
of
like
a
wine
that
had
something
else
spilled
into
it
the
sediment
was
unmistakable
and
the
head
disappeared
within
a
few
minutes
after
the
pour
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
of
sweet
and
tart
fermented
raspberries
and
a
bit
of
the
wild
yeast
in
there
too
the
taste
is
sour
makes
me
almost
pucker
i
sipped
this
one
for
quite
some
time
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
a
little
on
the
flatter
side
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
a
little
too
pricey
to
have
again

of

is
great
but
the
onset

sour
is
intense
im
not
one
to
complain
about
a
little
sour
but
the
chalky
aftertaste
of
dissolved

and
acid
with
an
earthy
underripe
sour
cherry
bite
is
a
bit
much
for
me
this
would
probably
benefit
from
about
20
years
in
the
basement
to
mellow
the
fck
out
i
struggled
through
my
half
of
the
bottle

d
not
something
i
would
have
every
day
but
its
easy
to
put
down
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
sweet
taste
make
swigs
easy

the
abv
comes
knocking
if
you
take

sour
ale
o

potential
o
i
am
really
glad
i
picked
this
up
it
is
an
extreme
beer
to
be
sure
but
very
interesting
if
you
like
sours
i
feel
like
this
is
my
first
real
sour
and
that
this
is
just
an
amped
up
version
of
the
other
sour
beers
i
have
had
it
is
my
first
american
wild
ale
i
dont
understand
the
relatively
low
scores
arent
sours
supposed
to
be
sour
this
is
very
acidic
and
mostly
in
a
good
way
the
barrelingoaking
is
great
decent
body
somewhat
higher
carbonation
fairly
dry
on
the
palate
this
drinks
pretty
well
but
it
was
a
bit
challenging
to
finish
the
bottle
between
two
people
especially
due
to
the
acidic
sourness
which
seemed
to
mount
over
time
definitely
tasty
but
not
something
id
want
to
take
on
by
myself
d
wish
they
had
this
in
12oz
bottles
its
a
bit
too
much
but
not
bad
to
share
with
a
friend
i
was
glad
to
try
this
and
it
does
have
some
good
aspects
but
there
was
something
a
bit
off
like
it
was
just
too
boozy
dvery
big
flavors
lots
of
alcohol
sweetness
and
yeast
id
thick
this
is
better
with
some
age
to
mellow
the
carbonation
and
alcohol
d
a
nice
wild
ale
that
is
very
tart
the
smell
is
insanely
sour
and
its
a
lip
puckering
beer
would
like
to
have
again
drinkability
the
use
of
raspberries
here
is
nearly
perfect
in
terms
of
getting
the
potential
out
of
the
fruit
riserva
or
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
are
tops
for
me
right
now
obviously
different
types
of
beers
but
no
other
beer
even
gets
close
to
producing
an
adequate
raspberry
taste
for
me
this
is
something
i
would
keep
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
drink
haha
bucket
loads
of
acidity
however
the
raspberry
flavor
is
well
done
a
new
batch
of
this
beer
with
better
bugs
could
have
a
lot
of
potential
i
may
look
for
this
in
the
future
if
they
tweak
it
a
bit
drinkability
not
sure
what
to
make
about
this
one
it
tastes
great
but
the
nose
is
a
bit
underwhelming
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
takes
away
from
the
beer
ive
had
the
2009
and
really
enjoyed
that
one
so
ill
measure
the
drinkability
as
an
average
of
the
two
skål
the
taste
is
odd
one
minute
it
has
a
sweet
raspberry
which
seems
to
turn
funky
and
sour
and
in
the
same
taste
is
alcoholic
and
has
a
bitter
edge
with
more
funk
and
light
sugary
tang
too
i
cant
say
it
is
terrible
but
just
doesnt
seem
to
mesh
and
the
wierd
vinous
elements
clash
with
the
strong
alcohol
taste
i
was
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
wish
i
had
tasted
it
earlier
i
probably
shouldnt
have
saved
it
and
i
am
willing
to
guess
some
of
the
fruit
may
have
covered
the
strong
booziness
it
just
tastes
like
it
is
past
its
prime
d
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
thanks
to
drfabulous
fro
sharing
drinkability
super
sour
and
dry
the
acidity
is
almost
overwhelming
but
this
beer
is
still
good
d
small
pour
is
good
for
this
splitting
with
two
other
people
is
idle
sharing
this
with
4
or
5
is
probably
better
its
an
intense
treat
great
palate
cleanser
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
will
happily
drink
again
if
someone
was
sharing
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
with
some
nice
fruit
notes
the
flavors
do
lack
a
little
balance
and
it
does
feel
a
bit
like
a
sour
bomb
but
i
enjoyed
it
im
really
surprised
how
well
the
abv
was
hidden
mouthfeel
suffers
due
to
overpresent
alcohol
and
underpresent
carbonation
as
for
drinkability
it
wasnt
bad
i
easily
sipped
my
way
through
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
but
the
second
half
will
be
a
chore
drinkability
a
little
bit
better
than
i
expected
i
remember
batch
1
of
weyerbacher
riserva
being
blasted
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
make
of
it
at
first
and
didnt
particularly
care
given
that
i
wasnt
trading
yet
and
knew
this
beer
wasnt
being
distributed
in
virginia
was
it
west
coast
wild
ale
hubris
was
it
not
sour
enough
for
the
sour
heads
who
knows
this
ones
sour
enough
for
me
and
thought
it
doesnt
ascend
quite
to
the
funky
levels
of
those
russian
river
classics
which
i
taste
hints
and
flourishes
of
here
consecration
and
supplication
being
the
closest
perhaps
more
the
latter
than
the
former
id
put
it
right
up
there
with
cuvee
de
castleton
in
my
book
as
the
best
nonrussian
river
u
s
wild
ale
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
though
i
have
a
rosso
in
my
cellar
at
the
moment
im
hoping
for
my
sake
will
bust
that
standard
as
it
stands
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
the
11
4
is
an
afterthought
completely
unnoticeable
and
only
faintly
expressive
in
my
mannerisms
after
nursing
this
for
an
evening
watching
the
golden
globes
tentatively
recommended
if
only
because
of
the
price
point
though
i
guess
thats
also
nothing
new
for
those
who
fancy
the
style
i
have
to
take
points
off
for
mouthfeel
because
i
expect
carbonation
even
though
the
bottle
warned
there
wouldnt
be
this
is
a
relatively
heavy
beer
as
well
the
mouthfeel
lowers
the
drinkability
but
this
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
thanks
for
cracking
this
one
andy
looks
like
cranberry
juice
seriously
still
and
no
head
looks
alright
but
boring
and
it
doesnt
really
resemble
beer
to
me
holy
tart
the
aroma
is
really
tart
its
a
tart
cider
vinegar
aroma
with
a
slightly
sweet
and
very
tart
raspberry
finish
well
the
pallet
is
a
lot
more
mellow
than
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
aroma
lets
on
and
it
finishes
just
slightly
tart
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
light
and
damn
near
still
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
its
hard
for
me
to
get
it
into
the
mindset
that
im
drinking
beer
on
this
guy
overall
its
good
flavor
and
an
enjoyable
sipper
drinkability
quite
the
beer
here
very
sour
and
very
fruity
and
hard
to
believe
this
beer
is
over
11
abv
id
honestly
compare
this
beer
more
to
a
raspberry
vinaigrette
than
to
any
other
beer
that
i
can
think
of
once
your
palette
gets
used
the
sour
though
its
very
enjoyable
thanks
much
jeff
you
generous
sonagun
d
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
this
i
really
love
this
beer
the
mixture
of
sweet
and
sour
notes
along
with
the
beautiful
raspberry
flavor
is
amazing
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
for
any
fan
of
sour
beers
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
t0rin0
for
sharing
this
one
on
my
recent
trip
to
cali
served
from
bottle
into
a
challice
poured
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
and
tart
notes
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
sour
tart
and
raspberries
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
quite
excellent
it
was
definitely
a
very
nice
palate
cleanser
style
brew
for
the
evening
not
a
whole
lot
missing
in
this
one
that
could
be
improved
upon
for
what
they
were
going
for
in
it
really
glad
this
is
readily
available
in
my
area
currently
d
this
batch
didnt
seem
to
be
quite
as
good
as
the
previous
ones
though
that
could
be
due
to
my
increased
experience
with
wild
beers
still
enjoyable
enough
though
poured
a
pinkish
brown
in
color
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
very
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
lots
of
raspberries
in
the
aroma
alongside
some
citrus
acidic
and
oaky
notes
but
had
a
little
bretty
funk
and
faint
vinegar
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
was
moslty
composed
of
tart
raspberries
slight
vinegar
character
but
had
oaky
citrusy
funky
accents
and
a
touch
of
acidity
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
fruity
oaky
mild
funky
and
tart
finish
actually
enjoyed
this
brew
a
lot
and
thought
it
was
a
solid
wild
ale
it
definitely
was
tasty
and
was
drinking
good
nice
beer
good
change
of
pace
2010
batch
i
went
to
abes
cold
beer
looking
for
a
sour
and
this
seemed
like
a
good
option
however
upon
opening
it
was
clear
this
beer
wasnt
going
to
stand
up
to
previous
reviews
there
was
a
strongly
acidic
earthy
garden
tang
not
quite
of
rotting
produce
or
horseblanket
but
very
unpleasant
the
raspberry
element
was
quite
good
and
nicely
balanced
against
the
level
of
the
funk
the
sour
character
needs
work
i
did
not
bother
to
finish
the
bottle
its
not
the
pleasant
zesty
flavors
and
aromas
youd
expect
in
a
ftamboise
type
ale
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
picked
up
a
couple
of
extra
bottles
to
enjoy
and
see
how
they
develop
this
years
bottling
ruby
pour
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
slight
pink
ring
of
foam
around
the
glass
and
no
lacing
these
are
still
waters
aroma
is
abundantly
sweet
raspberry
veering
into
lindmanns
territory
that
sweetness
is
in
the
taste
up
front
but
the
vinegary
pucker
evens
things
up
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
the
the
beer
but
could
be
better
drinkability
for
a
bottle
of
this
size
is
a
chore
best
to
share
amongst
friends
this
is
a
worthy
experiment
from
weyerbacher
and
fans
of
wild
and
sour
beers
wont
find
much
off
putting
here
i
am
appreciative
of
a
sour
with
this
high
an
abv
which
is
not
the
norm
for
the
style
recommended
with
that
warning
bottle
2010
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
cloudy
reddish
color
with
a
slight
white
collared
head
wow
just
wow
the
bottle
even
comes
with
a
warming
that
this
beer
is
exceptionally
sour
and
they
arent
kidding
the
nose
is
strong
acetic
with
an
underlying
raspberry
fruitiness
sweet
and
sour
mouthpuckering
and
dry
light
mouthfeel
the
fruit
does
come
through
nicely
though
very
good
surprised
at
how
cloudy
this
beer
still
is
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
with
very
low
carbonation
makes
it
tougher
to
drink
disappointing
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
especially
paying
almost
19
for
the
bottle
alas
its
simply
not
for
me
d
this
beer
was
gone
it
seemed
like
once
it
hit
my
glass
i
actually
liked
the
lack
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
was
it
the
most
sour
beer
i
have
had
no
not
really
was
it
fantastic
never
the
less
why
yes
yes
it
was
i
am
glad
weyerbacher
did
good
by
bottling
this
and
just
putting
the
warning
label
on
it
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
in
the
sourness
a
job
well
done
poured
somewhere
between
a
light
brown
and
a
red
with
no
head
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
a
cidery
vinegary
smell
it
smelled
very
sour
the
taste
had
notes
of
black
cherry
and
currants
but
they
were
faint
this
beer
was
totally
dominated
by
its
extreme
sourness
it
was
very
tart
reminded
me
of
those
crybaby
candies
the
sourness
just
coats
your
toungue
and
lingers
i
now
understand
what
people
mean
when
they
use
the
term
horse
blanket
to
describe
these
kinds
of
beers
i
love
sours
but
this
was
way
too
sour
for
me
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
relatively
recently
at
the
coppermine
pub
in
north
arlington
nj
a
fellow
patron
walked
in
with
this
bottle
into
a
4oz
sampling
glass
it
poured
a
cloudy
pink
like
grapefruit
juice
mixed
with
cranberry
juice
with
less
than
a
finger
of
head
poor
retention
and
lacing
and
little
visible
carbonation
the
nose
was
amazingly
floral
and
berryish
strawberry
blackberry
cranberry
etc
the
taste
confirmed
this
a
nicely
balanced
sour
berry
nuance
throughout
and
finishing
on
a
sour
note
thin
smooth
and
very
little
carbonation
this
was
a
nice
surprise
definitely
not
something
id
session
but
maybe
something
id
consider
serving
at
a
holiday
party
in
flutes
a
very
nice
elegant
yet
fruity
offering
d
i
hope
that
it
didnt
damage
the
plumbing
connected
to
the
drain
the
taste
is
a
different
story
this
is
overthetop
source
and
the
slight
fruit
presence
from
the
nose
is
completely
gone
instead
there
is
an
incredible
amount
of
pucker
factor
and
a
hefty
dose
of
vinegar
after
alex
shared
that
santa
fe
wild
a
few
weeks
back
i
thought
that
i
had
reached
a
sour
peak
not
necessarily
so
ill
bump
the
mouthfeel
for
the
fact
that
i
somewhat
enjoyed
trying
to
choke
this
down
before
it
melted
my
nearlyfrozen
insides
on
this
frigid
frigid
morning
oh
yeah
its
flat
drinkability
was
not
good
if
not
for
the
pure
novelty
of
trying
to
drink
something
this
sour
theres
not
really
much
to
enjoy
here
o
i
raised
my
review
slightly
since
my
review
from
several
years
ago
really
really
nice
and
the
best
weyerbacher
beer
in
their
arsenal
drinkability
ive
been
missing
out
all
of
these
years
with
wild
american
ales
but
now
that
ive
seen
the
light
ive
been
saved
thank
you
weyerbacher
and
your
ilk
for
showing
me
the
right
path
that
ive
overlooked
excellent
if
your
a
fan
of
the
sours
get
this
in
your
glass
right
now
this
is
not
for
the
uninitiated
into
the
world
of
sour
beer
unless
youve
had
a
lambic
or
a
gueze
youre
not
going
to
be
ready
for
this
for
those
of
us
who
love
these
beers
this
one
is
a
lot
of
fun
i
cant
help
but
think
that
many
other
breweries
would
have
poured
this
beer
due
to
the
mustiness
taken
from
the
vinegar
taste
but
weyerbacher
released
it
with
the
warning
on
the
bottle
kudos
to
them
for
doing
so
knowing
that
there
would
be
some
of
us
out
there
that
would
enjoy
this
beer
drinkability
the
acidic
harshness
could
be
a
bit
much
over
time
however
a
750ml
goes
down
fine
by
yourself
not
a
bad
value
either
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
drinkability
drinks
easy
enough
but
so
many
people
are
nailing
the
american
wild
ale
style
it
takes
a
bit
more
to
earn
high
marks
these
days
a
few
years
ago
this
would
have
been
notable
2010
bottle
whoa
pours
a
hazy
iron
red
color
with
some
wispy
head
to
it
apparently
there
was
more
carbonation
than
the
bottle
led
me
to
believe
there
would
be
nose
is
slightly
medicinal
but
thats
kind
of
the
nature
of
raspberry
beers
in
my
experience
but
tart
and
acidic
notes
are
definitely
there
too
raspberries
make
a
play
the
first
sip
is
just
bracing
very
very
very
sour
and
tart
leans
on
the
tart
side
of
things
but
acetic
notes
make
a
play
too
raspberries
come
through
midpalate
giving
a
bit
of
relief
almost
burns
my
lips
reminds
me
of
rose
de
gambrinus
but
a
little
more
robust
and
a
little
less
elegantrefined
this
is
a
hell
of
an
experience
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
over
the
sour
onslaught
tough
drink
but
one
i
certainly
didnt
want
to
end
gonna
grab
another
for
sure
even
at
the
18
price
tag
the
overly
sour
notes
make
this
one
a
sipper
as
does
the
high
abv
you
cant
do
this
for
long
but
you
can
enjoy
it
while
it
lasts
outstanding
beer
i
went
out
and
bought
a
bottle
a
week
later
interested
to
see
how
time
plays
on
this
one
because
their
is
no
carbonation
it
makes
drinking
this
a
real
chore
damn
shame
too
this
could
be
a
real
contender
with
any
wild
ale
out
there
but
the
flat
look
and
taste
really
knocks
its
creditability
down
kind
of
dissapointing
acidic
fuel
nose
burning
ridiculous
acidic
mouth
some
decent
raspberry
underneath
oak
but
completely
destroyed
by
the
ridiculous
acidic
bullshit
i
do
not
have
time
for
this
d
ive
got
to
say
im
really
dissapointed
with
this
sour
i
know
they
are
supposed
to
be
high
on
funk
but
really
this
just
made
me
regret
the
18
00
pricetag
im
also
glad
i
split
the
bottle
with
my
girl
and
she
kind
of
liked
it
ive
got
one
more
bottle
and
im
hoping
that
a
few
or
10
years
does
something
good
to
this
beer
d
sips
like
a
rosé
with
alcohol
punch
like
a
sherry
again
one
glass
is
very
enjoyable
with
fruit
and
cheese
disclaimer
please
dont
drink
dilute
fingernail
polish
etoac
is
bad
enough
by
itself
but
there
are
much
more
nasty
compounds
than
just
the
acetate
in
these
products
d
wow
this
is
great
to
drink
if
i
had
the
opportunity
id
finish
a
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
without
noticing
the
alcohol
until
later
i
really
like
how
the
sourness
gives
way
to
some
sweetness
beer
is
thin
and
super
bright
on
the
palate
its
about
as
complex
as
you
can
get
its
pretty
hard
to
drink
due
to
the
high
acidity
not
much
in
the
way
of
lactic
acid
its
all
acetic
all
the
way
the
brett
character
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
beer
just
a
rough
start
2010
batch
awesome
this
year
ill
go
ahead
and
say
it
its
like
gambrinus
extra
love
it
murky
raspberry
red
with
a
whitepink
head
that
pops
and
fades
just
like
i
like
for
the
style
nose
is
fermented
tart
raspberry
wood
funk
faint
cobwebby
cellar
vanilla
and
on
a
tad
sweet
and
i
would
love
to
see
where
this
batch
is
going
to
go
after
a
few
years
in
the
bottle
taste
is
tart
oaky
raspberry
with
a
hair
of
cider
just
like
nose
suggested
and
in
very
appealing
harmoñy
if
this
batch
is
11
then
it
should
get
a
5
0
for
drinkability
because
there
is
just
a
hint
of
heat
wrapped
up
in
it
that
elevates
the
other
flavors
amazingly
well
blown
away
by
how
good
this
years
batch
is
awesome
not
for
everyone
though
and
i
wonder
if
there
is
variation
from
barrel
to
barrel
because
from
reading
other
reviews
it
doesnt
sound
like
this
is
the
same
beer
at
all
anyways
i
loved
it
and
am
happy
to
see
weyerbacher
trying
their
hand
in
the
wonderful
world
of
wild
this
beer
tastes
like
a
true
flanders
red
ale
a
lot
like
rodenbach
grand
cru
if
you
can
imagine
carbonated
hunts
ketchup
with
malt
vinegar
you
got
the
idea
deep
smoky
amber
color
with
very
little
head
refreshing
and
smooth
the
11
abv
really
sneaks
up
on
you
another
great
beer
by
weyerbacher
one
of
the
best
pa
breweries
was
fortunate
enough
to
try
this
last
weekend
at
weyerbacher
transparent
reddishbrown
body
with
little
carbonation
and
slight
head
splended
nose
with
hints
of
rasberry
and
suttle
oak
beauty
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
but
if
you
like
traditional
flemish
sours
you
will
love
this
this
is
one
of
the
top
ten
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
weyerbacher
has
done
it
again
bravo
bottled
2010
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
years
batch
compared
to
previous
years
the
appearance
was
as
expected
faint
cherry
red
as
in
previous
years
the
smell
is
what
draws
the
curiosity
as
it
exudes
raspberry
as
expected
and
deep
pungent
vinegar
tones
as
described
on
the
label
of
the
bottle
the
taste
was
the
sell
very
low
carbonation
and
extreme
sourness
that
is
backed
up
brilliantly
with
natural
sugars
this
wild
ale
is
outstanding
and
personally
i
do
not
prefer
wild
ales
in
general
as
a
hophead
i
surprisingly
enjoyed
it
to
the
point
that
i
went
out
and
bought
a
bottle
for
the
upcoming
holidays
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
ale
and
the
abv
is
clearly
understated
in
this
2010
batch
absolutely
a
must
if
you
are
into
sour
ales
d
sip
to
enjoy
this
is
deffinitely
an
acquired
taste
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
can
see
how
certain
people
go
nuts
over
this
stuff
would
buy
a
750ml
bottle
they
were
only
sellin
cases
at
the
brewery
though
for
145
a
case
little
pricey
glad
they
got
it
out
to
try
though
d
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
especially
for
having
an
abv
of
11
4
i
would
love
to
come
across
another
bottle
some
day
overall
this
competes
with
russian
river
as
far
as
wild
ales
go
it
may
be
a
three
trick
ponyraspberryoak
and
funk
but
the
way
they
all
blend
together
with
the
wonderful
sourness
is
a
work
of
art
ive
heard
the
2010
batch
is
even
more
sour
cant
wait
for
the
release
party
next
week
d
good
not
great
i
enjoyed
the
upland
raspberry
more
then
this
one
but
thats
not
to
say
i
wouldnt
take
the
chance
to
enjoy
again
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
although
it
seems
to
differ
from
yeartoyear
as
i
remember
trying
this
before
and
not
enjoying
it
nearly
as
much
750
ml
bottle
courtesy
of
diomede
pours
a
milky
brownishpink
color
with
a
fine
ecru
head
smells
like
soured
raspberry
tart
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
vivid
wild
berry
notes
flavor
is
sharp
and
tart
with
minor
solvent
character
perhaps
weyerbacher
was
a
bit
too
ambitious
with
the
alcohol
percentage
but
it
isnt
killing
me
the
acidity
helps
to
hide
it
to
a
degree
maybe
its
just
a
small
sample
size
but
i
dug
this
stuff
fresh
but
not
green
at
all
perfect
to
drink
now
and
were
sure
several
months
if
not
a
year
or
so
would
make
things
interesting
weyerbacher
is
right
on
target
with
riserva
please
keep
on
experimenting
guys
surprisingly
drinkable
for
what
it
is
not
quite
as
complex
or
brettywild
as
i
prefer
in
the
style
but
theres
more
than
enough
to
keep
me
engaged
second
glass
was
enjoyed
more
than
the
first
which
is
always
a
good
sign
altogether
very
well
done
and
fun
as
a
change
of
pace
even
if
its
not
exactly
my
thing
cheers
drinks
warm
the
obnoxious
funk
flavor
paired
with
the
unsettling
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
nigh
undrinkable
however
i
tried
it
colder
and
enjoyed
it
much
more
kudos
to
weyerbacher
for
bringing
something
new
to
the
american
wild
ale
table
riserva
is
a
hybrid
fruit
lambic
and
wild
ale
will
probably
give
purists
a
stroke
but
im
fully
onboard
with
their
vision
if
this
isnt
an
annual
release
it
should
be
thanks
onix1agr
do
a
decent
attempt
at
a
wild
from
the
guys
at
weyerbacher
with
the
alcohol
and
the
tart
bitterness
in
this
beer
it
was
becoming
a
chore
for
me
to
finish
towards
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
search
this
one
out
again
cheers
d
tartness
and
funk
makes
it
a
little
bit
less
than
sessionalbe
although
its
not
bad
good
stuff
ive
had
better
wilds
but
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
overall
this
is
ok
nothing
special
to
seek
out
a
little
sweet
but
not
a
good
wild
drinkabilityoverall
this
is
an
impressively
done
sour
and
im
curious
about
how
it
will
change
over
time
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
wine
a
little
bit
probably
because
of
the
oak
and
raspberries
i
think
this
beer
would
be
epic
without
the
raspberry
and
with
much
less
oak
perhaps
a
few
more
years
aging
would
help
this
one
out
the
body
is
light
surprisingly
light
for
such
a
strong
beer
so
this
goes
down
dangerously
quick
i
liked
it
more
than
most
beers
from
weyerbacher
but
once
is
probably
enough
2009
vintage
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
redbrown
color
with
a
white
head
it
looks
about
like
iced
tea
the
aroma
is
extremely
tart
raspberries
the
flavor
is
more
complex
with
raspberries
and
medium
tartness
you
also
get
some
oak
and
vanilla
the
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
sourness
but
it
is
not
near
as
sour
as
the
aroma
leads
you
to
believe
it
will
be
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
wow
this
is
awesome
for
a
little
brewery
what
a
great
wild
ale
the
reviews
on
this
beer
are
definitely
mixed
but
i
have
to
say
this
is
indeed
awesome
tons
of
tartness
up
front
acidicvinegar
like
oak
abounds
throughout
booziness
is
mild
for
the
abv
best

amoungst
all
this
confusion
of
flavors
tons
of

light

high

easy
drinker
way
to
go
weyerbacher
i
cant
wait
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
to
toss
in
the
cellar
d
i
probably
will
seek
this
one
out
again
because
i
really
like
weyerbacher
and
my
experience
seems
different
from
most
other
reviews
of
this
ive
seen
if
i
have
another
bottle
like
this
one
ill
never
consider
trying
it
again
fort

wild
pours
a
amberruby

obviously

more

to

even
had
alcohol
in
it
till
after
my
second
glass
was
finished
wasnt
all
that
i
had
hoped
for
but
i
also
make
extremely
unreasonable
expections
that
usually
never
get
met
would
definitely
buy
again
wish
it
was
a
bit
easier
to
get
my

sweetwine
may
catch
some
people
raw
really
glad
that
i
got
the
opprotunity
to
taste
this
pours
pinkish
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
vinegarlike
funk
that
is
very
acrid
and
almost
burns
my
nose
the
taste
is
much
more
funky
than
i
thought
based
on
the
description
on
the
bottle
i
would
have
thought
that
there
would
be
more
fruit
flavor
present
the
funk
and
the
carbonation
make
it
an
extraordinary
drinker
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
strong
drinker
its
not
fair
that
i
cant
find
this
locally
md
mouthfeel
is
biting
and
sharp
but
certainly
excites
the
tongue
this
is
extremely
drinkable
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
and
something
i
will
certainly
seek
out
in
the
future
d
enjoyed
by
all
and
despite
this
reviews
repeated
reference
to
alcohol
it
did
not
drink
too
hot
and
certainly
did
not
seem
anywhere
near

d
i
really
enjoyed
this
sour
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
bottle
i
wish
i
had
more
d
at
over
10
one
was
enough
although
i
dont
know
if
my
tastebuds
could
handle
much
more
over
a
year
in
the
making
this
beer
is
fermented
with
brettanomyces
yeast
and
aged
with

for
over
1
year

it

murky
deep
red
color
it
smelled
like
tart
raspberries
and
brett
so
good
so
far
it
tasted
sour
raspberries
oak
a
bit
vinegary
but
overall
a
good
pucker
in

raspberry

poured
a
dirty
and
cloudy

ale
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
minimal
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
gross
funky
notes
and
lightly
sweet
and
somewhat
tart
raspberry
is
pleasant
but
gets
gross
with
the
weird
funky
notes
taste
is
also
a
strange
mix
between
some
nice
tart
raspberry
notes
with
just
enough
sweetness
too
offset
the
acidity
but
the
weird
barnyard
notes
are
not
that
pleasant
body
is
quite
full
with
limited
filtration
and
medium
carbonation
with
no
apparent
alcohol
i
very
much
anticipated
tasting
this
one
but
must
admit
being
disappointed
after
all
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
red
color
with
a
14
white
head
with
pink
hues
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
sour
brett
nose
with
a
nice
raspberry
aroma
the
brett
dominates
with
little
oak
character
coming
through
the
taste
is
decent
its
equal
parts
raspberry
alcohol
and
brett
flavors
its
tart
with
a
good
amount
of
sourness
the
alcohol
character
is
a
little
much
it
takes
away
from
what
would
probably
be
a
really
nice
raspberry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
like
the
sounds
of
it
but
they
need
to
back
the
sugars
down
a
bit
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
the
world
from
this
beer
due
to
lackluster
reviews
but
i
was
wrong
a
very
well
done
beer
had
at
the
right
time
when
all
components
played
off
of
each
other
almost
perfectly
well
worth
a
shot
and
i
recommend
digging
in
after
about
six
months
notes
this
would
be
a
good
bottle
to
share
at
a
tasting
as
only
a
few
ounces
are
needed
to
get
an
idea
of
what
this
brew
is
all
about
drinkability
i
keep
wanting
to
tell
myself
you
know
this
might
be
a
4
overall
but
i
just
cant
bring
it
down
that
low
pretty
friggin
awesome
best
thing
weve
ever
had
from
weyerbacher
very

found
this

in

i
was

concerned

it

held
up

the
flavor
is
similar
with
a

additions
i
get
some
nice
toffee
and
brett
notes
with
some
cherry
and
dark
fruit
also
in
there
there
is
not
really
any
funk
from
the
brett
which
is
what
i
expected
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
interesting
overall
a
funky
bretty
complex
apocalyptic
brew
o
a
decent
attempt
at
a
wild
and
i
hope
ommegang
does
another
one
just
looking
more
for
that
lactic
mouthpuckerer
i
guess
or
even
in
this
brettforward
beer
some
more
depth
instead
it
isnt
remotely
sour
and
it
is
pretty
onenote

the

the

if
i
dove
face
first
into
a
pool
filled
with
band

it
wouldnt
taste
this
bretty

if
there
were
a
city
named
brett
this
beer
would
be
the
drink
of
choice
overall
pretty
good
beer
but
ommegang
has
wowed
me
with
other
gems
ommegeddon
is
very
easy
to
drink
might
come
off
sweet
but
not
your
lady
beer
you
know
beer
is
good
but
hard
to
have
a
consistent
crowd
with
it
you
be
the
judge
love
it
for
what
it
is
or
hate
it
for
what
its
not
the
purpose
of
aging
batch
1
was
the
hope
that
some
brett
would
finally
come
to
life
unfortunately
that
never
materialized
and
now
ive
grudgingly
worked
my
way
through
not
one
but
two
disappointing
bottles
of
this
beer
luckily
brewery
ommegang
has
years
of
banked
goodwill
and
i
dont
hold
this
against
them
in
fact
ill
make
a
point
of
buying
a
more
recent
batch
to
see
if
theyve
since
worked
things
out
the
taste
while
good
was
a
lot
more
malt
driven
when
i
had
it
fresh
i
kind
of
like
what
the
brett
has
done
here
giving
a
dimension
of
slight
fruit
and
spice
while
accenting
the
biscuit
and
toasted
malt
flavors
the
hops
have
an
herbal
spiced
accent
and
are
mild
in
relationship
to
the
yeast
which
gives
the
horseblanket
character
that
this
particular
strain
is
known
for
overall
a
good
wild
ale
i
am
glad
i
held
on
to
this
for
a
while
to
let
it
evolve
but
either
way
i
enjoyed
it
for
being
not
a
carbon
copy
of
every
other
belgian
a
nice
experiment
that
i
would
be
interested
in
seeing
ommegang
try
again

fruit
flavors
funk
and
a
bitter
hop
finish
the
bitterness
from
the
dry
hopping
is
pretty
mild
but
sticks
around
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
wild
ale
with
some
nice
funky
and
hoppy
flavors
i
was
expecting
this
one
to
be
more
sour
though
750
ml
belgian
corkncage
batch
3
from
april
2008
sampled
may
2011
pours
a
mildly
chillhazed
deep
gold
with
strong
enough
carbonation
to
slowly
push
the
frothy
white
head
out
of
the
glass
clingy
lace
finally
grabs
the
glass
after
the
second
pour
smells
malty
and
toasty
with
citric
hops
a
few
phenols
and
perhaps
some
melon
the
palate
is
similar
but
more
phenolic
and
citric
orange
zest
and
pulp
grapefruit
lemon
maybe
a
bit
lactic
and
surprisingly
hoppy
with
leafygreen
and
spicyperfumy
notes
but
only
a
moderate
yet
rather
sharp
bitterness
it
is
light
and
smooth
almost
silky
with
a
pronounced
almost
tannic
dryness
an
interesting
beer
that
is
kind
of
in
the
same
vein
as
orval
with
noticeable
but
rather
light
brett
almost
more
of
a
spiciness
than
funk
definitely
worth
a
try
its
refreshing
easy
to
drink
has
no
trace
of
alcohol
and
it
apparently
ages
very
gracefully
if
i
didnt
know
for
sure
i
never
would
have
guessed
that
this
was
three
years
old
it
would
be
interesting
to
do
a
vertical
tasting
of
this
one
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
color
the
head
was
big
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
hoppy
and
had
a
big
aroma
of
brett
coming
off
of
it
there
was
also
just
a
touch
of
yeast
and
tart
fruits
the
taste
ofthe
beer
gives
off
a
sour
taste
upfront
not
really
my
favorite
thing
the
there
are
elements
of
the
yeast
and
hops
in
the
aftertaste
but
the
sourness
holds
tight
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
overall
its
got
a
sourness
to
it
that
i
wasnt
too
thrilled
about
other
than
that
its
not
too
bad
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
dissolving
white
head
definitely
has
farmhouse
horse
hoof
aroma
coupled
with
saison
spiciness
flavor
is
balanced
and
spicey
i
little
tart
fruitiness
possibly
from
the
ginger
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
a
funky
saison
d
very
drinkable
the
balance
of
tart
and
sour
as
well
as
other
flavors
is
really
nice
there
are
also
some
nice
funky
elements
mixed
in
as
well
the
cpj
d
with
the
sweetness
and
mouthfull
pulling
this
overhyped
sled
i
dont
feel
that
it
is
exceptionally
drinkable
i
dont
finish
a
22oz
and
wish
for
another
certainly
not
an
aladdins
lamp
just
some
murky
candy
factory
that
has
been
overrun
by
barnyard
animals
if
you
are
a
soggy
sweet
lover
or
enjoy
glazed
hay
here
is
your
jam
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
was
worried
that
the
taste
wouldnt
match
the
smell
like
mikkeller
its
alive
this
bottle
brought
to
the
tasting
courtesy
of
zep9865
this
one
is
batch
1
june
of
2007
this
beer
poured
a
very
cloudy
dull
gold
in
color
on
the
verge
of
a
dull
orange
with
a
light
white
head
that
laced
the
glass
a
decent
amount
of
dusty
looking
sediment
sprawled
out
upon
the
bottom
of
my
snifter
the
cork
literally
shot
out
of
the
bottle
and
hit
the
ceiling
it
smells
very
tart
and
has
a
lot
of
peach
skin
to
it
you
definitely
get
a
healthy
dose
of
brett
the
flavors
are
a
little
subdued
once
again
you
get
good
tartness
and
the
brett
brings
the
dry
sourness
as
the
bottle
says
this
is
a
funkhouse
ale
the
funk
is
out
of
this
world
nuclear
holocaust
apocalypically
so
wowzers
it
is
tart
and
bitter
it
drinks
fine
and
dry
it
is
almost
cider
like
but
not
quite
there
did
i
mention
it
was
dry
this
is
a
solid
wild
and
not
as
fruity
as
most
being
a
batch
1
i
might
have
to
pick
another
one
of
these
up
its
a
solid
wild
d
admit
i
was
a
bit
worried
about
this
one
but
was
in
the
mood
for
something
funky
and
it
was
cold
so
i
dove
in
going
down
easy
enough
and
complex
to
a
point
that
its
keeping
my
interest
solid
beer
here
though
maybe
drink
it
fresh
if
its
released
again
drink
good
a
little
weird
but
good
i
like
the
dicotomy
of
flavors
from
dampcitrusfunk
had
a
different
feel
for
me
which
i
liked
o
its
a
solid
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
great
but
its
another
quality
beer
from
ommegang
d
if
you
dig
the
funk
this
would
e
a
3
for
my
palate
though
its
on
the
lower
end
d
this
is
excellent
if
only
it
were
possible
to
package
this
in
smaller
formats
calling
it
a
sour
its
alright
calling
it
a
witbier
its
amazing
and
dammit
im
going
to
classify
this
as
a
witbier
in
my
mind
this
is
a
medium
bodied
offering
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
warming
in
its
effect
but
is
seemingly
nonexistent
in
its
flavor
quite
drinkable
and
well
balanced
could
use
some
more
funk
to
make
it
really
standout
but
asis
its
a
quality
product
that
i
would
enjoy
again
drinkability
this
is
the
first
ommegang
that
i
havent
liked
it
was
way
off
style
even
for
a
style
that
is
illdefined
was
flat
in
both
body
and
flavor
and
really
lacked
the
kind
of
depth
that
you
expect
from
this
otherwise
wonderful
brewery
d
its
fairly
drinkable
but
i
cant
imagine
anyone
ever
wanting
more
than
a
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
i
was
set
with
half
drinkability
its
a
good
beer
but
not
overly
exciting
really
it
needs
to
be
either
funkier
or
they
need
to
sour
it
to
make
it
really
great
ive
had
this
fresher
it
had
a
distinctive
sour
character
to
it
this
was
the
same
batch
from
almost
a
year
later
theres
practically
no
sourness
im
not
complaining
really
because
we
still
have
a
good
beer
here
but
does
this
make
sense
could
finish
the
bottle
with
no
problem
i
think
id
go
for
it
again
drinks
pretty
well
for
the
style
id
certainly
love
to
have
this
one
again
cloudy
apricot
pour
with
huge
lingering
head
kind
of
nondescript
aroma
of
dry
sour
brett
and
yeast
flavor
is
a
an
explosion
of
sour
fruits
orange
grapefruit
lemon
with
strong
leather
and
barnyard
tones
and
a
really
dry
finish
there
is
a
kind
of
harsh
lingering
flavor
too
looking
back
on
this
it
was
probably
a
lingering
brett
on
the
finish
that
i
didnt
find
was
integrated
like
i
wanted
dwow
this
is
just
such
a
smooth
beer
as
the
drink
goes
on
the
tastes
do
sort
of
blend
together
i
might
have
rather
had
this
in
a
regular
12oz
bottle
but
i
still
did
enjoy
every
sip
of
this
beer
i
definitely
hope
to
have
more
of
this
some
day
and
i
definitely
will
be
telling
my
friends
about
this
one
22
ounce
bomber
aroma
is
quite
funky
with
a
big
barnyard
smell
going
on
peppery
brett
hits
the
nose
first
followed
by
straw
and
grass
taste
is
caramel
sweet
but
very
dry
in
the
finish
some
alcohol
burn
as
you
drink
it
easily
quaffable
and
quite
good
a
really
nice
drinkable
beer
and
a
great
showcase
for
how
to
use
brett
i
find
ommegang
dont
really
set
a
foot
wrong
and
i
enjoyed
this
immensely
drinkability
is
not
to
high
would
much
rather
move
onto
another
beer
d
overall
i
found
this
to
be
rather
bland
and
unexciting
bottled
may
2009
so
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
pours
an
almost
clear
light
orange
color
with
big
white
head
lookin
nice
aroma
is
quite
funky
grassy
and
sweet
i
pick
up
light
notes
of
cheese
and
a
bit
of
sour
apple
aroma
taste
is
very
unique
initially
i
get
green
apple
flavor
followed
by
extremely
mild
sourness
and
lemon
zest
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
and
funky
flavors
with
grass
and
hay
end
fairly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
delicious
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
very
dry
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
good
saison
drinkability
is
fairly
high
embrace
the
funk
batch
4
may
2009
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
poured
a
dark
yelloworange
with
a
two
finger
slightly
offwhite
head
that
subside
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
funk
and
slight
golden
apple
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
one
wasnt
that
bad
but
it
also
wasnt
that
great
either
the
followthrough
was
kind
of
pungent
with
alcohol
while
cold
but
mellowed
out
just
a
hint
upon
warming
up
decent
aroma
and
flavor
here
but
nothing
too
memorable
though
d
not
bad
once
the
carbonation
is
quenched
nice
one
to
sit
around
and
enjoy
alone
if
you
dont
consider
that
a
leading
characteristic
of
alcoholism
compare
the
hops
to
an
older
batch
like
this
this
is
extremely
drinkable
d
i
wish
this
wasnt
so
boozy
because
i
did
like
the
rather
funky
qualities
this
beer
has
drinkability
damn
good
beer
i
think
the
aging
took
some
of
the
sourness
i
have
had
it
fresh
and
it
was
much
better
good
beer
however
drinkability
a
very
nice
beer
however
i
feel
there
are
way
better
examples
of
the
style
at
a
similar
price
overall
this
is
awesome
the
label
deffinitly
caught
my
eye
and
this
does
not
disapoint
has
held
up
nicely
after
2
5
years
d
i
got
down
to
about
34
and
couldnt
finish
it
wouldnt
ever
get
it
again
rather
pay
a
little
extra
and
get
jolly
pumpkin
or
russian
river
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
nice
funkiness
complex
and
tasty
still
good
with
close
to
3
years
on
it
i
dont
know
what
to
say
for
drinkability
it
is
not
a
hard
slog
and
it
is
good
but
i
feel
that
one
big
glass
would
probably
be
enough
try
this
one
not
really
for
the
brettas
it
isnt
very
sour
but
for
the
all
out
complexity
light
and
spritzy
this
beer
is
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
dont
really
know
why
given
ommegangs
excellence
when
it
comes
to
brewing
topnotch
belgian
style
ales
i
could
enjoy
a
whole
750
of
this
on
my
own
and
not
bat
an
eyelash
dprobably
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
i
have
had
this
brew
i
keep
wanting
more
from
it
certainly
not
bad
at
all
in
fact
its
quite
decent
just
does
not
make
me
wanting
more
this
is
bottling
4
may
2009
maybe
that
explains
a
little
bit
some
time
to
age
once
it
warmed
up
this
was
a
damn
fine
beer
too
cold
and
it
sucked
donkey
ass
thanks
nate
definitely
another
solid
offering
from
ommegang
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
but
do
not
let
that
stop
you
from
trying
it
the
taste
is
slightly
more
subdued
than
the
smell
sweet
pale
malts
take
over
the
top
earthy
and
floral
hops
follow
a
nice
sour
only
slightly
pear
and
dusty
hay
taste
for
the
finish
very
smooth
carbonation
is
a
little
high
but
just
barely
amazing
wild
ale
bless
the
brett
i
rally
enjoyed
this
brew
well
worth
12
98
and
ill
be
getting
a
few
to
cellar
with
my
russian
rivers
d
pretty
average
tasting
belgian
ale
with
some
tangy
notes
at
the
end
to
me
the
funky
vinegar
taste
helps
to
elevate
it
a
little
bit
but
otherwise
i
am
not
really
wowed
i
drank
it
by
itself
but
i
can
imagine
this
would
pair
really
well
with
food
and
that
would
probably
help
the
drinkability
as
well
it
will
be
awhile
before
i
pick
this
up
again
if
at
all
but
i
might
just
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
cheers
pour
very
slowly
into
a
tulip
a
clear
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
soft
fluffy
white
head
smell
was
decent
picked
up
a
fair
bit
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
funk
on
the
back
end
taste
wasnt
what
i
expected
very
plain
and
slightly
lacking
i
dont
know
i
guess
i
was
just
hoping
to
be
punched
in
the
face
by
funk
but
instead
only
got
a
malt
with
a
little
lemon
zest
and
cracked
pepper
the
funk
from
the
brett
didnt
pick
up
till
after
swallowed
and
then
was
very
faint
felt
light
bodied
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
in
my
mouth
all
in
all
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
expected
at
all
i
would
drink
it
again
but
it
definitely
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
by
anymeans
served
in
a
flight
with
oro
de
calabaza
and
allagash
confluence
along
with
a
dish
of
grilled
white
prawns
and
tomatillopeach
salsa
this
one
matched
the
food
best
and
for
the
record
i
tasted
the
peach
flavors
before
the
dish
hit
the
table
it
was
unmistakable
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
the
drinkability
is
inviting
however
the
sourness
may
become
unwelcome
after
2
of
these
backtoback
i
think
this
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
it
is
basically
a
belgian
golden
ale
with
some
wild
spice
nothing
too
shocking
just
a
little
wild
twist
jd
ill
still
buy
other
ommegang
beers
just
probably
not
this
one
again
this
is
not
a
big
beer
with
big
flavors
this
is
an
almost
elegant
beer
with
a
nice
funk
in
the
finish
i
like
it
lighter
style
all
around
but
with
a
lot
of
appeal
and
very
universally
food
friendly
this
beer
is
an
orange
hued
medium
amber
with
a
white
head
that
is
not
billowing
by
any
means
but
has
pretty
good
staying
power
the
aroma
is
very
tart
with
plenty
of
fruity
esters
and
some
crystal
malt
sweetness
the
main
aromas
that
i
am
getting
are
that
of
tart
cherry
which
is
odd
the
flavor
has
me
a
bit
disappointed
it
is
quite
lactic
and
has
a
lot
of
white
grape
flavor
to
it
slightly
peppery
and
spicy
yeast
shows
through
some
dried
sherry
like
flavors
caramel
malt
slight
booziness
and
some
herbal
hop
flavor
it
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
for
a
beer
with
a
mushroom
cloud
on
the
front
of
the
bottle
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
fireworks
if
not
a
small
thermonuclear
explosion
in
my
mouth
the
body
is
medium
and
fairly
chewing
with
effervescent
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
above
average
but
not
great
make
sure
to
let
this
one
warm
a
little
it
definitely
improves
the
flavor
d
what
can
i
say
i
enjoy
a
good
funky
beer
this
one
offers
a
good
subdued
funk
with
a
dry
finish
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
fresh
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
had
the
this
year
hands
down
it
wasnt
hard
to
drink
ot
bad
by
any
means
but
was
not
impressed
by
any
means
d
i
am
perplexed
by
this
brew
it
is
not
that
its
bad
but
it
is
definitely
massively
underwhelming
perhaps
my
expectations
are
to
blame
but
it
smelled
so
damn
funky
and
fruity
why
didnt
it
taste
like
that
damn
the
body
was
nicely
tongue
coating
without
being
overly
sticky
drinkability
was
great
i
wish
i
hadnt
held
on
to
this
bottle
so
long
ill
be
drinking
other
bottle
soon
overall
a
top
shelf
beer
worth
seeking
out
d
this
is
defiantly
a
slow
goer
split
a
bomber
with
wife
but
could
have
probably
handled
one
myself
d
great
on
a
hot
summer
morning
as
my
clock
just
turned
to
501am
where
did
the
time
go
anyway
good
beer
and
a
great
drinker
this
always
finds
its
way
to
the
fridge
from
every
one
and
a
while
d
decent
flavor
but
nothing
overpowering
i
have
another
bottle
that
i
will
age
for
a
while
to
see
how
it
changes
db
not
worth
the
price
jolly
pumpkin
is
around
the
same
price
and
better
imo
i
really
liked
the
label
and
other
ommegang
ales
i
have
had
a
bit
disappointing
but
also
a
decent
experience
maybe
i
will
try
it
fresh
some
time
as
the
bottle
i
have
was
about
a
year
old
tasted
from
bottle
batch
4
may
2009
pouts
light
amber
orange
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
nose
of
sweet
orange
oil
pastry
breadiness
and
tropical
fruits
surprisingly
there
is
only
a
hint
of
brett
funk
flavors
of
lemon
pith
orange
oil
with
slight
hop
bitterness
and
a
semisweet
roundness
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
very
round
with
a
great
mouthfeel
the
honeyed
finish
displays
some
brett
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
unique
beer
that
may
benefit
from
some
more
time
in
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
some
orange
in
it
white
head
didnt
leave
much
lace
but
stuck
around
a
long
time
carbonation
sent
yeast
all
over
the
place
inside
the
bottle
resulting
in
a
somewhat
chunky
brew
aroma
is
herbal
with
honeylike
malts
dusty
funk
and
mild
lactic
tartness
tastes
of
herbal
hops
chalky
dry
funk
honeyish
maltiness
finish
is
very
dry
with
a
cookie
finish
and
dusty
funk
light
bodied
carbonation
seems
to
match
nicely
yet
the
funk
is
somewhat
astringent
in
the
way
it
puckers
decently
drinking
to
split
with
friends
but
not
something
i
will
revisit
d
i
think
this
one
sat
a
little
too
long
and
should
have
been
drank
at
least
6
months
earlier
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
so
i
can
map
out
all
the
differences
soild
try
still
from
ommegang
doverall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
a
rather
weak
interpretation
of
the
style
fairly
smooth
on
the
drinkability
meter
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
of
white
fizzy
head
lots
of
fizzy
carbonation
and
fair
lacing
light
alcohol
taste
very
sweet
and
lively
with
a
citrus
like
smell
and
taste
followed
by
a
bit
of
a
ginger
ale
taste
like
finish
over
all
it
was
a
very
good
beer
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
dits
a
great
looking
beer
especially
in
the
glass
i
used
but
it
didnt
really
blow
me
away
by
the
taste
i
want
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
to
compare
someday
its
very
well
balanced
for
an
8
beer
drinkability
couldnt
do
more
than
three
or
four
poured
a
corked
and
caged
750
into
my
dogfish
head
snifter
i
removed
the
cage
and
could
see
the
pressure
already
starting
to
force
up
the
cork
i
decided
to
see
how
long
it
would
take
for
it
to
push
it
out
so
i
let
it
sit
not
2
minutes
later
i
hear
a
pop
thump
and
see
my
corkless
ommegeddon
no
foam
over
but
man
that
brett
must
have
chewed
up
something
poured
into
my
dogfish
head
snifter
and
all
i
got
was
6
inches
of
frothy
icinglike
head
with
14inch
of
actual
beer
after
about
3
minutes
the
head
settled
and
i
was
able
to
pour
in
6
more
inches
of
foam
eventually
i
was
able
to
get
a
full
snifter
out
of
it
one
big
sniff
told
me
my
inclinations
were
right
the
brett
chewed
up
something
and
became
huge
massive
notes
of
barnyard
must
damp
earth
and
just
a
little
bit
of
urine
under
all
that
brett
comes
lemon
zest
and
just
a
hint
of
orange
the
flavor
is
just
as
dominated
as
the
nose
is
by
the
brett
this
beer
tastes
musty
musty
with
grass
lemon
zest
over
saturated
earth
and
your
great
grandmothers
moth
filled
closet
this
is
hands
down
the
brettiest
beer
ive
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
while
leaving
your
tongue
sandpaper
dry
still
has
a
hint
of
residual
sugar
makes
me
wonder
what
this
beer
would
be
like
in
another
year
overall
this
wasnt
a
great
experience
the
brett
dominated
every
single
aspect
of
this
beer
and
while
i
enjoy
brett
as
a
complimentary
flavor
it
produces
to
many
barnyard
flavors
to
be
front
and
center
i
think
that
maybe
after
68
months
in
the
bottle
would
be
a
prime
time
for
the
brett
to
mature
but
still
retain
what
the
beer
is
about
great
beer
was
surprised
by
this
one
loved
it
drinkability
this
was
much
more
of
a
saison
than
a
wild
ale
in
my
opinion
with
that
said
it
was
still
a
pretty
good
beer
really
misses
the
mark
on
style
though
overall
impression
i
had
this
right
after
ommegang
hennepin
and
i
very
much
prefer
this
over
that
it
is
more
complex
more
interesting
and
more
flavorful
it
is
also
a
lot
more
expensive
and
there
are
other
american
wild
ales
brett
saisons
out
there
that
i
like
better
if
you
have
the
coin
go
for
it
notes
the
first
of
three
consecutive
brewery
ommegang
beers
that
i
will
taste
and
rate
this
week
not
my
favorite
ommegang
that
honor
belongs
to
hennepin
but
a
pretty
nice
beer
overall
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
was
pretty
drinkable
as
well
the
funk
is
a
stake
in
the
aftertaste
where
is
stayed
for
a
few
moments
d
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
held
up
to
aging
quite
well
for
8
alc
i
really
cant
taste
it
and
will
finish
bottle
by
myself
clean
and
enjoyable
and
a
wellhidden
8
a
highly
hopped
belgian
pale
with
a
dose
of
brett
for
good
measure
this
is
a
winner
d
highly
drinkable
says
all
but
im
highly
dissapointed
ive
had
fresher
orval
that
is
funkier
overall
not
a
good
first
try
maybe
ill
get
one
to
age
and
try
again
in
the
future
i
think
another
appropriate
name
for
this
beer
would
have
been
tongue
twister
once
again
awesome
stuff
one
more
good
one
from
ommegang
this
one
is
a
touch
different
but
in
a
good
way
i
like
it
note
drinking
cellered
ommegeddon
even
after
a
couple
of
months
funk
moves
in
on
flavor
nice
poured
from
750ml
into
a
red
wine
glass
batch
4
may
2009
on
the
top
of
the
bottle
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
like
cider
in
appearance
the
pour
gave
way
to
a
large
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
fades
into
thin
sea
foam
that
floats
on
the
surface
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
smells
funky
real
funky
actually
brett
and
citrus
dominate
the
taste
is
citrusy
lemon
and
less
funky
than
the
smell
spicy
on
the
forefront
and
has
a
very
smooth
finish
not
as
complex
and
tasty
as
some
of
my
favorite
russian
river
wilds
but
still
very
good
tart
but
not
too
puckering
or
funky
surprisingly
hoppy
and
it
remains
bitter
throughout
while
only
being
slightly
sour
very
dry
finish
some
crisp
fruit
notes
mostly
apple
and
pear

d
an
interesting
beer
seems
like
a
hybrid
of
styles
still
lots
of
belgian
tripel
left
behind
in
this
beer
but
transformed
by
the
bretanomyces
brett
adds
an
interesting
layer
of
flavors
on
top
different
take
on
a
wild
ale
than
ive
had
before
very
belgian
not
sour
complex
noticeable
alcohol
presence
overall
enjoyable
and
recommended
to
give
it
a
try
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
worth
a
try
for
any
fan
of
the
brett
you
really
cant
taste
the
abv
like
you
can
in
other
ommegang
brews
drinkability
if
it
were
cheaper
id
drink
it
occassionally
but
i
dont
think
id
sit
down
and
have
a
glass
every
time
its
a
flavor
adventure
and
i
do
advise
everyone
to
try
a
glass
but
its
somewhat
costly
i
paid
13deposit
for
a
750ml
bottle
pours
golden
sun
rise
with
some
cloudiness
and
white
head
over
top
smells
of
apple
skins
light
fruit
juice
cider
alcohol
spritzy
mouthfeel
with
flavors
of
apples
pears
cider
alcohol
toward
the
finish
but
disappears
behind
light
fruity
sour
notes
that
dance
on
the
tongue
the
brett
is
there
but
not
in
the
forefront
of
the
taste
if
this
is
ommegeddon
then
im
a
sinner
baby
an
exceptional
offering
by
ommegang
spritzy
spritey
with
bubbles
exploding
from
the
bottom
horse
urine
color
horse
trough
scent
stank
blanket
and
all
malt
shows
up
on
an
american
imperial
pilsner
bod
and
looks
like
wild
motts
alcohol
is
bit
chardonnayish
with
sour
twangy
tongue
twisting
notes
plenty
of
green
apples
and
high
pitch
twitter
tap
dancing
interesting
but
lost
allure
halfway
through
im
also
drinking
this
with
two
feet
of
fucking
snow
on
the
ground
every
ale
has
its
place
drinkability
this
strikes
me
as
a
super
sour
hennepin
i
like
it
but
will
probably
not
get
it
again
for
the
price
above
average
for
the
style
great
beer
if
you
like
brett
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
two
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lots
of
little
bubbles
rising
throughout
leaving
thick
patchy
lacing
this
beer
brings
the
funk
with
brett
aromas
like
candy
sweet
tarts
and
lemonheads
with
tons
of
citrus
exceptional
funky
sweet
sour
tart
flavors
of
lemon
orange
passionfruit
banana
with
a
spicy
corriander
kick
mixed
in
highly
carbonated
light
bodied
this
beer
finishes
very
dry
with
a
tart
bitter
pucker
feel
good
solid
drinkability
the
variety
of
aromas
and
flavors
make
you
go
back
for
more
but
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
initial
impression
by
the
look
and
smell
d
an
interesting
beer
that
smells
amazing
a
good
body
feel
to
it
but
rather
potent
in
its
sour
bitter
flavors
but
otherwise
is
a
solid
beer
d
im
really
happy
im
sharing
this
cause
a
750
ml
to
myself
would
be
devastating
for
two
reasons
a
to
my
sobriety
and
b
to
my
tastebuds
a
great
beer
with
wonderful
nuances
to
explore
while
sipping
but
a
sessioner
nah
flavor
mouthfeel
abv
all
wellbalanced
for
an
8
farmhouse
no
problem
finishing
the
750ml
alone
bueno
d
this
struck
me
as
somewhere
between
de
ranke
xx
bitter
and
a
cantillon
lambic
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wild
ales
but
this
was
a
serviceable
example
hazy
light
amber
golden
color
with
a
massive
bone
white
that
is
dense
and
airy
with
tiny
bubbles
and
has
nice
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
and
spicy
reminding
me
of
a
saison
mild
brett
presence
in
the
background
also
some
lemony
citrus
medium
body
with
fine
sharp
carbonation
that
finishes
smoothly
with
some
lingering
citrus
sweetness
and
mild
brett
funkiness
flavor
is
dominated
more
by
a
saisonlike
flavors
spices
pepper
lemon
light
hops
earthiness
in
general
sweeter
than
expected
and
while
the
brett
funk
is
presence
throughout
never
quite
as
strong
as
you
would
expect
from
the
label
not
complaining
very
nice
easy
drinking
with
little
alcohol
presence
very
nice
beer
great
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
saisony
but
if
i
want
something
more
bretty
there
are
better
options
d
abv
isnt
too
present
and
the
flavors
arent
too
wild
if
you
like
brett
youll
like
this
a
good
beer
worth
trying
for
sure
but
not
my
favorite
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
nose
but
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
its
light
and
airy
slightly
tart
with
a
fair
amount
of
rubbery
brett
flavor
much
of
the
citrus
noted
in
the
smell
makes
its
way
to
the
party
and
contributes
some
hoppy
flavor
and
bitterness
i
think
the
best
way
to
sum
this
beer
up
is
that
it
is
a
crisp
easy
drinking
brett
beer
kinda
like
a
belgian
golden
ale
with
some
funk
3550
on
the
nose
its
completely
different
from
my
previous
exposure
to
this
beer
the
brett
is
pretty
prominent
with
a
complex
aroma
of
hay
wet
leather
and
a
mild
bandaid
character
mild
citrus
and
pineapple
is
present
behind
it
but
its
driven
primarily
by
the
brett
funk
on
the
palate
likewise
the
flavors
are
pure
brett
funk
leather
open
things
up
and
the
citrus
character
follows
with
a
great
orangetangerine
character
dries
up
pretty
incredibly
on
the
finish
leaving
mild
funk
and
bandaid
character
the
high
carbonation
keeps
this
lively
on
the
palate
as
well
despite
being
rather
simple
in
flavors
this
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
i
would
definitely
purchase
this
one
again
great
drinkability
i
could
sit
on
this
all
day
overall
a
great
almost
next
time
opened
both
bottles
and
compared
the
2007
had
a
much
more
complex
flavor
fuller
hop
character
and
less
head
even
though
the
2008
has
had
18
months
to
age
in
the
brewery
it
still
needs
a
little
more
time
in
my
opinion
still
a
great
beer
but
back
to
the
cellar
for
the
2008
maybe
next
year
buddy
the
carbonation
is
high
but
pleasant
this
is
my
first
in
your
face
brett
brew
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
im
not
sure
if
its
my
thing
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
itll
take
a
couple
sittings
this
one
is
a
slightly
golden
hazy
almost
yellowybeige
with
surprisingly
little
foam
the
aroma
is
big
on
funky
citrus
some
esters
and
a
little
bit
of
barnyard
taste
is
a
big
blast
of
citrus
funkiness
with
a
sort
of
tart
astringency
it
finishes
pretty
dry
but
is
not
terribly
bitter
the
best
part
is
that
the
complex
flavor
is
complemented
by
quite
a
light
body
furthermore
the
cleansing
effervescence
awakens
the
senses
with
each
taste
there
seems
to
be
a
new
level
of
flavor
with
each
sip
this
is
really
an
intriguing
and
delicious
beer
ill
definitely
have
more
d
i
imagine
this
is
a
good
intro
to
wild
ales
its
mellow
on
the
sour
but
still
funky
pair
it
with
some
slightly
melted
feta
on
a
slice
of
bread
drinkability
is
pretty
high
if
youre
a
fan
of
brett
and
malty
farmhouse
ales
definitely
more
biere
de
garde
then
saison
to
me
but
pretty
good
the
abv
is
well
hidden
for
sure
i
did
like
this
beer
just
not
where
i
want
my
brett
wild
ales
to
be
at
this
age
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
i
will
stick
to
one
glass
of
it
i
would
classify
this
as
a
saison
and
not
a
wild
ale
either
way
i
was
glad
to
get
to
try
it
d
a
nice
drinking
beer
but
i
doubt
i
would
choose
to
make
a
night
out
of
this
beer
good
but
not
great
d
i
had
rather
high
expectations
on
this
one
and
unfortunately
they
werent
completely
met
still
a
good
beer
though
but
its
slightly
too
onesided
with
too
much
emphasis
on
funkiness
and
sweet
and
spicy
alcohol
the
tartness
that
i
associate
with
this
kind
of
brews
is
to
a
large
extent
missing
also
the
funk
could
have
been
even
more
skewed
and
rough
around
the
edges
as
it
is
now
its
to
clean
and
wellbehaving
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinker
that
is
perfect
for
summer
this
one
ages
very
well
as
i
have
had
several
bottles
of
this
in
the
past
two
years
hold
for
at
least
14
months
or
so
imo
nice
brew
ommegang
d
there
were
no
punches
pulled
in
making
this
brew
it
is
aggressively
farmy
and
funky
one
has
to
imagine
though
how
difficult
it
must
be
to
temper
the
brettanomyces
that
bring
out
the
flavors
here
this
brew
is
steps
away
from
being
too
funky
but
several
steps
ahead
of
other
wild
ales
in
the
liberty
given
to
the
wild
yeasts
to
do
their
thing
certainly
not
the
best
introduction
to
wild
ales
but
if
youre
already
a
fan
of
the
style
grab
one
of
these
for
sure
a
750ml
bottle
from
the
first
batch
shared
with
psycohops
and
poured
into
a
pair
of
shaker
glasses
the
ale
appears
a
mildly
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
lingering
bone
white
head
nose
and
flavor
are
of
fruits
such
as
pear
apricot
very
little
wild
yeast
characteristics
left
after
almost
two
years
in
the
bottle
to
me
the
flavors
and
aromas
have
knitted
together
quite
nicely
very
refreshing
at
this
point
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
have
a
bottle
or
two
of
batch
1
laying
around
by
all
means
open
and
enjoy
it
now
its
drinking
really
nice
batch
1
june
2007
picked
this
up
in
cooperstown
on
a
recent
trip
heard
about
it
but
this
one
doesnt
make
it
down
to
texas
pours
with
a
large
foamy
head
that
stays
about
a
14
inch
the
whole
way
down
strong
aroma
of
bubblegum
citrus
and
some
spice
looks
a
lot
like
the
witte
to
me
this
is
amazingly
smooth
it
starts
off
with
some
sourness
that
never
really
goes
away
its
not
overpowering
just
right
there
are
some
earthy
flavors
that
supply
that
drying
finish
some
fruit
flavors
show
up
every
other
sip
i
wish
i
picked
up
more
than
one
while
i
was
there
nice
people
at
the
brewery
and
they
brew
some
great
stuff
d
flavorful
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
sourstyle
but
not
overly
sour
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
good
tasting
beer
and
im
glad
ive
tasted
it
but
it
was
not
what
i
hoped
if
you
like
this
seek
out
the
de
proef
flemish
primitive
series
75cl
bottle
from
batch
3
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
disappears
rather
quickly
without
much
lacing
strong
brett
presence
some
leather
notes
with
a
lot
of
perfume
character
cherry
and
citrus
esters
somewhat
sweet
and
floral
though
the
brett
is
overwhelming
tastes
strongly
of
leather
and
mineral
the
brett
is
overpowering
here
as
well
some
citric
notes
quite
dry
overall
slightly
oxidized
lightmedium
body
with
high
carbonation
tastes
like
straight
brett
without
any
other
character
really
like
a
bad
bottle
of
oude
orval
this
one
seems
to
get
a
little
more
flavor
as
it
warms
but
it
never
gets
as
good
as
it
should
be
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
a
huge
disappointment
for
me
since
i
love
this
brewery
so
much
notes
sour
but
not
overtly
funky
has
achieved
excellent
balance
on
the
mouthfeel
with
the
sourness
and
the
explosive
dry
carbonation
working
together
in
harmony
pulling
the
ends
towards
the
middle
has
vastly
improved
since
its
release
would
love
to
see
this
one
another
year
from
now
overall
this
wasnt
as
funky
as
the
label
and
description
led
me
to
believe
but
its
still
a
tasty
beer
not
as
complex
as
other
bspas
with
brett
influences
de
proef
with
rob
todd
for
example
but
still
worth
a
try
d
decent
especially
for
a
brett
beer
but
its
all
relative
as
duvels
drinkability
is
dangerous
in
comparison
i
shared
this
one
i
think
id
have
a
hard
time
getting
through
a
whole
bottle
on
my
own
overall
if
this
and
la
fin
du
monde
are
really
indicative
of
the
end
of
the
world
i
wont
mind
the
rapture
hell
id
welcome
it
if
i
got
to
drink
this
at
the
end
a
perfectly
enjoyable
wild
ale
will
definitely
buy
again
especially
since
i
cant
get
russian
river
stuff
where
i
am
conclusion
this
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
its
definitely
an
acquired
taste
as
well
the
aftertaste
and
overall
impression
of
the
beer
are
quite
nice
but
upon
first
sip
its
a
little
bit
crazy
id
personally
have
liked
a
little
less
bitterness
here
750
ml
about
12
is
poured
into
my
chimay
chalice
and
it
generates
a
finger
head
that
holds
well
golden
straw
colored
beer
has
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
substantial
brett
grains
and
mustiness
true
to
the
style
taste
is
sour
with
grapefruit
being
the
predominant
flavor
would
be
tough
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
you
arent
used
to
they
style
as
the
tartness
and
brett
are
quite
overwhelming
however
i
thought
it
was
a
refreshing
beer
golden
hazy
color
with
medium
to
thin
white
head
aroma
is
decidedly
belgian
yeast
in
style
lightly
spicy
grassy
fruity
and
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
no
real
tart
nose
here
flavor
is
lightly
fruity
but
very
very
dry
as
if
from
spices
i
assume
it
is
from
the
brettanomyces
hmmm
not
a
winner
for
me
but
it
is
quite
interesting
d
i
expected
more
wild
flavors
than
this
one
delivered
its
not
particularly
sour
not
much
funk
to
this
im
not
sure
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
plenty
of
better
examples
in
the
style
d
as
i
said
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
it
grew
on
me
however
i
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
ill
ever
crave
again
or
get
excited
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
good
complexity
and
a
must
for
brettlovers
seems
like
everyone
is
experimenting
with
brett
these
days
however
i
had
this
about
6
months
ago
and
it
seems
to
have
lost
some
of
the
zing
looks
like
its
past
its
peak
drink
up
now
palate
more
citrus
not
as
defined
on
the
palate
as
it
is
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
white
grapes
and
tart
kiwi
seed
quality
on
the
finish
very
crisp
and
drinkable
this
is
one
refreshing
beer
d
pretty
good
i
enjoy
this
one
i
dont
understand
the
wild
taste
yet
but
im
sure
it
will
grow
on
me
the
beer
tastes
tart
fruity
and
floral
with
grapefruit
and
citrus
rind
citrus
blossom
and
plenty
of
that
classic
brett
funkiness
this
is
outstanding
refreshing
palateawakening
and
definitely
moreish
lingering
sourfunky
finish
incredible
i
was
under
the
impression
this
was
more
of
a
sour
than
a
funky
belgian
still
very
tasty
glad
i
managed
to
find
this
at
lone
hill
d
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
experience
complexity
in
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
memorable
brew
i
have
no
complaints
on
the
appearance
but
wish
the
aroma
was
slightly
more
assertive
a
glass
of
pure
white
head
on
top
of
maybe
a
half
inch
of
straw
yellow
beer
forget
the
vigor
in
the
pour
thankfully
it
settled
down
fairly
quick
subsequent
pours
yield
a
meringuelike
head
which
dissipated
quickly
aroma
is
faint
but
smells
like
im
in
a
field
next
to
a
citrus
grove
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
tastes
like
it
smells
maybe
a
bit
sourgood
and
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
which
is
nice
this
bomber
went
down
slow
and
easy
overall
extremely
complex
and
tasty
normally
i
dont
like
sour
beers
but
this
ones
great
stuff
highly
recommended
crisp
and
sharp
up
front
like
a
saison
without
the
in
your
face
barnyard
flavor
almost
like
a
light
cider
with
a
good
deal
more
acidity
behind
it
quick
burst
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
before
it
evolves
into
a
mild
tartness
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
palate
the
rest
of
the
way
through
fairly
light
body
and
not
as
dry
as
some
beers
i
have
come
across
so
far
its
more
of
an
off
dry
that
accentuates
the
other
flavors
going
on
lots
of
citrus
almost
grapefruity
the
tartness
opens
up
more
and
more
as
the
beer
warms
not
a
mouthpuckering
sourness
by
any
stretch
but
quite
pleasant
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
and
i
would
imagine
sour
as
well
from
my
limited
experience
but
high
carbonation
leads
to
a
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
mouth
experience
it
keeps
fresh
on
the
palate
far
greater
than
i
expected
amazingly
drinkable
ive
drained
my
tulip
by
this
time
and
am
now
getting
more
if
this
is
the
introductory
beer
to
sours
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
into
this
wonderful
world
sour
funk
the
brett
i
guess
immediately
apparent
on
the
nose
and
it
is
very
nice
recalls
belgian
geuezes
nicely
appley
fruitiness
underneath
some
lemon
and
coriander
this
beer
shows
best
after
warming
closer
to
room
temp
the
carbonation
settles
down
to
a
mild
fizziness
this
is
dry
somewhat
sharp
beer
this
is
a
good
thing
the
bitter
hoppiness
combined
with
a
pleasing
sourness
convey
the
tart
fruit
apricot
and
apple
very
nicely
really
comes
across
as
an
excellent
saisonand
actually
despite
the
dry
sourness
is
creamier
than
a
cantillonstyle
lambic
i
think
the
fact
that
i
am
thinking
about
some
of
the
best
belgins
on
earth
indicates
that
this
is
a
very
good
brew
i
am
loving
the
interplay
between
the
brett
sourness
and
funk
and
the
cris
hoppy
bitterness
the
finish
is
extremely
long
certainly
one
of
ommegangs
best
brews
very
glad
i
found
some
when
i
visited
the
brewery
last
autumn
this
brew
was
not
available
but
some
months
in
the
bottle
probably
were
good
for
it
a
nice
amalgamation
of
disparate
beer
styles
that
works
very
well
cheers
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
one
all
night
long
sourness
is
crisp
but
not
overwhelming
more
funky
than
sour
taste
is
wonderfully
fresh
a
tiny
bit
of
sour
a
little
more
with
the
dregs
from
the
bottle
poured
in
with
the
rest
very
light
mouthfeel
like
a
proper
belgian
ale
drinkable
isnt
the
right
word
its
refreshing
and
not
filling
its
great
just
needs
a
little
more
acidity
and
funk
but
very
drinkable
and
a
good
readily
available
introduction
to
this
side
of
the
beer
spectrum
i
dont
think
that
the
cellaring
did
much
for
it
as
i
think
it
lost
some
of
the
hop
character
that
the
brewers
intended
nice
to
try
this
i
dont
venture
into
this
range
very
often
sampled
the
2008
release
after
the
2007
and
noticed
a
definite
difference
with
the
2007
being
more
complex
750ml
bottle
from
the
liquor
shop
in
tyngsborro
mass
pours
a
murky
yellowamber
with
a
good
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
smells
sweet
and
sour
with
hints
of
citrus
and
apple
tastes
sweet
with
lemon
pith
acidity
some
sour
applecider
character
hard
to
describe
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
awesome
and
funky
thats
all
i
can
say
id
love
to
see
how
it
ages
drinkability
is
good
ill
probably
buy
it
again
to
mix
things
up
starts
with
a
nice
full
taste
that
turns
to
the
nice
sour
citrus
explosion
with
a
lingering
finish
slight
sweetness
to
the
finish
as
well
light
hop
notes
but
pretty
weak
on
that
front
not
as
interesting
as
some
of
the
other
bretts
ive
had
but
its
pretty
good
nonetheless
a
lot
of
carbonation
here
with
a
very
creamy
texture
overall
not
too
bad
for
a
wild
ale
but
im
gonna
try
to
age
one
a
bit
and
try
this
one
again
although
unexpected
i
enjoy
the
direction
this
beer
took
the
tartness
is
very
tame
by
wild
ale
standards
but
this
beer
steers
in
a
different
direction
showcasing
other
more
subtle
aspects
of
the
wild
yeast
d
a
750ml
bottle
goes
down
smooth
easy
d
i
think
this
one
maybe
like
a
beginner
for
the
wildsour
taste
easy
to
drink
very
unique
style
artfully
done
with
some
wonderful
american
touches
to
a
belgianstyle
ale
exemplary
without
a
doubt
delightfully
funky
but
supremely
balanced
highly
recommend
peppery
with
strong
lemon
zest
flavor
lots
of
yeast
bite
to
the
drink
which
lasts
through
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
not
much
hop
this
is
mostly
dry
malt
thin
body
and
highly
carbonated
considering
how
infrequently
ive
seen
this
and
how
expensive
it
is
this
probably
isnt
anything
ill
be
picking
up
regularly
drinking
but
it
is
interesting
and
ill
be
in
the
lookout
for
other
wild
ales
na
zdravje
d
pretty
good
was
a
little
anxious
about
the
brett
but
its
subdued
this
one
drank
nice
with
the
combo
of
sweet
light
malt
flavors
spice
and
a
bit
of
drying
bitterness
and
tartness
this
is
alright
but
if
youre
coming
here
for
underwearstaining
funk
youre
in
the
wrong
spot
d
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
while
not
the
eppic
poem
to
brett
that
the
russian
river
sours
are
this
is
a
good
beer
i
still
have
a

drinks
too
easy
abv
is
really
well
hidden
im
usually
ambivalent
about
most
wild
ales
but
this
one
a
nice
one
that
makes
me
think
i
will
probably
like
these
more
more
with
each
one
tartness
slowed
me
down
a
little
at
the
end
no
big
deal
well
done
ommegang
overall
a
great
brew
from
a
great
brewery
its
just
that
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
funk
and
less
of
the
earthy
grassy
tones
it
looks
outstanding
and
the
aroma
is
extremely
interesting
and
pleasant
everything
else
is
just
lacking
slightly
good
beer
though
this
style
is
really
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
you
can
tell
this
is
a
well
constructed
beer
having
said
that
it
really
is
growing
on
me
and
i
am
enjoying
it
more
than
i
initially
thought
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
gold
color
and
formed
a
huge
foamy
white
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
a
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
citrus
hops
and
barnyard
funkiness
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
citrus
and
pepper
the
body
is
light
and
the
finish
rather
sprite
i
am
not
big
on
farmhouse
ales
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
and
it
hides
its
alcohol
level
well
it
forces
the
mouth
to
pucker
and
the
lips
to
perse
enjoyable
as
something
unique
but
not
as
a
permanent
addition
i
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
the
first
thing
that
is
noticed
is
teh
amount
of
carbonation
the
cork
almost
flies
across
the
room
when
the
bottle
was
opened
the
beer
is
a
hazy
gold
in
color
with
a
massive
white
overcarbonated
head
the
aroma
is
citrusy
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
much
more
muted
than
expected
a
little
funky
a
little
spicy
but
the
taste
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
the
beer
is
light
in
body
and
imo
overcarbonated
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
i
think
would
pair
well
with
most
foods
this
beer
is
over
priced
and
imo
does
not
give
good
value
for
its
hefty
price
tag
rated
dec
1
2007
as
a
beer
itself
this
is
very
enjoyable
worth
the
price
tag
not
in
my
eyes
but
a
good
tweener
for
those
getting
into
brett
summary
this
was
11
and
my
first
venture
into
sour
beers
i
figured
that
even
if
i
hated
it
it
would
be
worth
trying
i
dont
hate
it
and
in
fact
i
see
the
draw
in
sour
beers
over
the
course
of
my
glass
i
have
gone
back
and
raised
my
rating
for
every
single
category
i
have
nothing
helpful
as
to
how
this
compares
to
other
sour
beers
but
if
you
are
like
me
and
curious
about
sour
beers
this
seems
to
be
a
fairly
approachable
first
step
d
this
is
a
solid
entry
from
ommegang
but
not
my
favorite
still
a
well
made
brew
nothign
about
this
one
bowls
you
over
and
its
certainly
less
funky
than
it
was
billed
but
the
sum
seems
to
be
greater
than
the
parts
in
this
beer
making
a
very
drinkable
fairly
complex
and
very
enjoyable
beer
in
a
snifter
this
was
a
pretty
beer
gold
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
knocked
me
out
really
earthy
and
fruity
i
dont
think
the
taste
lived
up
to
the
aroma
however
sour
fruit
spicy
a
little
tame
nevertheless
it
was
still
a
most
enjoyable
beer
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
dank
yeasty
aroma
with
overripe
oranges
and
earth
taste
was
hoppy
and
sweet
with
the
barnyard
funk
bloodorange
sweetness
in
the
hops
worked
well
with
the
earthiness
of
the
yeast
they
used
a
very
nice
subtle
brett
strain
that
does
not
take
over
the
beer
very
nice
but
it
does
pack
a
brutal
hangover
this
wild
ale
pours
a
light
yellow
with
tons
of
cascading
carbonation
that
feeds
the
snow
white
cap
steadilyhelping
retention
and
giving
the
lace
some
time
to
stick
the
nose
is
peppery
and
has
some
funky
odors
this
is
my
first
wild
ale
and
i
must
say
i
am
impressed
with
the
complexity
i
get
waves
of
pears
sourdough
breads
pepper
dry
mushrooms
powdery
spores
and
moldy
cheese
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
extremely
dryi
love
dry
chardonnay
and
this
is
bordering
on
thati
love
it
i
split
a
bottle
with
a
friend
and
for
me
it
was
just
the
perfect
amount
of
this
funky
goodnessa
full
bottle
may
be
a
little
hard
to
finish
on
my
own
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
and
strange
beers
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
and
its
definitely
one
of
the
most
complex
too
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
a
nearperfect
score
is
the
fact
that
the
odd
flavors
dont
really
lend
themselves
well
to
drinkability
damn
fine
beer
from
one
of
the
best
brewers
out
there

smells
like
a

all
the
way
tall

the
hazy

colored
beer
lots
of
belgian

spiciness
some
vanilla
and
candied
sugar
and
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
it
smells
much
more
wild
then
it
tastes
theres
a
hint
of
that
citric
twang
in
the
finish
but
not
much
mouthfeel
is
light
and
almost
spritzy
its
quite
interesting
and
pretty
damned
tasty
i
nkow
it
takes
a
lot
to
make
this
kind
of
beer
but
at
13
this
is
a
one
time
thing
went
really
well
with
some
double
cream
brie
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
dont
get
a
whole
lot
of
funkiness
from
it
i
enjoyed
it
though
and
would
recommend
it
to
others
very
easy
drinking
light
and
spritzy
i
imagine
this
would
be
more
funky
had
i
enjoyed
it
from
the
bottle
i
dont
know
why
i
always
overlook
these
guys
because
everytime
i
pick
up
an
ommegang
i
enjoy
it
i
especially
love
their
design
bottling
this
battle
for
dominion
nearly
caused
a
cat
ruckus
i
unwound
the
cage
to
the
cork
the
cork
shot
off
straight
away
before
i
was
done
unwinding
i
took
it
as
excitement
to
come
as
i
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
i
noticed
a
nice
aroma
that
had
a
bit
of
mild
funkiness
to
it
especially
as
the
white
but
nice
head
formed
the
taste
was
a
bit
metallic
but
also
a
bit
grassy
and
complex
with
a
slight
apple
taste
i
feel
that
if
served
too
cold
this
was
at
room
temperature
which
in
my
house
is
a
cellar
equivalent
then
the
metallic
taste
might
overwhelm
ruin
the
taste
i
felt
pleasantly
involved
in
this
battle
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
as
well
as
other
offerings
from
these
guys
overall
this
beer
is
on
par
easy
to
drink
nothing
overwhelming
and
a
decent
offering

sometime
its
difficult
to
separate
the
quality
of
a
beer
within
the
style
relative
to
my
own
likes
and
dislikes
and
as
much
as
id
like
to
appreciate
farmhouse
ales
it
is
a
style
that
has
yet
to
fall
into
favor
with
me
with
regards
to
ommegeddon
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
just
not
a
style
that
i
enjoy
3

drinkability
i
had
high
hopes
that
this
beer
was
going
to
be
sour
and
funky
it
was
sour
at
all
and
it
wasnt
all
that
funky
to
me
it
was
just
a
regular
saison
with
a
little
more
yeast
and
that
barnyard
taste
added
to
it
compared
to
the
other
ommegang
bottled
beers
its
really
not
worth
the
extra
money
i
would
rather
drink
hennepin
than
ommegeddon
d
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
with
the
grilled
sea
bass
and
will
continue
to
buy
for
sure
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
it
pours
a
hazy
yellow
orange
color
very
similar
to
the
witte
i
had
just
before
this
one
medium
sized
white
head
some
funk
to
the
nose
but
mostly
just
mild
grassy
hops
very
subdued
flavor
as
well
this
doesnt
have
nearly
the
funk
that
previous
batches
of
bottles
have
still
and
all
a
nice
flavor
of
citrus
fruits
pale
malts
and
grassy
earthy
qualities
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
d
i
paired
this
with
chicken
parmesan
tonight
and
it
went
very
well
i
loved
the
spice
characteristics
with
the
spices
going
on
with
the
dish
i
highly
recommend
that
pairing
kraig
served
in
an
ommegang
rare
vos
glass
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
very
funky
odor
kind
of
like
a
better
version
of
my
hockey
bag
taste
is
quite
interesting
dry
a
little
bitter
from
the
hops
along
with
elements
of
pepper
and
spices
relatively
easy
drinking
for
a
stronger
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
funk
aspects
not
my
favorite
ommegang
but
a
quality
offering
d
let
me
make
a
distinction
this
is
a
great
drinkable
beer
from
ommegang
but
at
the
price
of
10
99
a
750ml
i
will
probably
keep
reaching
for
hennepin
or
saison
dupont
or
saint
landelin
la
divine
which
i
can
enjoy
at
a
much
cheaper
price
drinkability
i
like
this
one
and
have
had
it
several
times
this
particular
one
was
brewed
in
april
of
08
so
i
think
it
couldve
used
a
bit
more
cellar
time
all
in
all
i
have
to
say
buy
it
really
not
that
great
my
first
wild
ale
so
here

batch

april
2008
served
in
my
dt
tulip
poured
a
translucent
yellowgold
with
a
dense
two
inch
bright
white
head
that
eventually
settles
into
a
quarter
inch
solid
cap
some
strands
of
lacing
with
fair
retention
copious
tiny
bubbles
effervesced
from
the
base
of
the
glass
to
the
bottom
of
the
cap
nose
reminded
me
slightly
of
a
saison
a
little
grassy
a
little
funky
a
little
musty
but
much
less
spice
also
picked
up
some
medicinal
phenols
towards
the
back
of
the
bouquet
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
not
as
funky
as
anticipated
perhaps
a
little
peppery
and
some
citrus
astringency
detected
along
the
cheeks
and
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
lively
with
a
mild
carbonation
burn
that
lingers
along
the
tongue
and
the
roof
of
the
mouth
finish
is
fairly
clean
and
dry
great
drinkability
all
the
qualities
of
a
saison
but
spice
profile
is
much
more
subdued
batch1
june
2007
i
cellared
this
for
longer
than
the
minimum
of
6
months
as
stated
on
the
bottle
this
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
lots
of
carbonation
rushing
to
the
top
at
first
it
smells
like
ginger
ale
but
really
yeasty
champagne
like
and
slightly
sour
the
taste
is
sour
and
citric
there
was
a
nice
suggestion
of
pear
and
sour
apple
this
is
funky
as
i
consumed
the
brew
i
came
across
some
weird
flavors
sweetarts
licorice
must
earth
medicine
definite
funk
the
feel
is
smooth
but
lightly
tingly
from
the
carbonation
the
alcohol
flavor
is
barely
there
the
large
bottle
wont
be
hard
to
finish
its
very
drinkable
and
exotic
i
am
a
loyal
ommegang
fan
i
would
put
this
one
in
the
top
4
of
their
beers
for
sure
hennepin
as
my
top
its
a
toss
up
on
the
next

rare

dubbelabbey
ommgeddon
drinkability
well
i
tried
it
perhaps
ill
buy
another
bottle
and
let
it
age
for
612
months
and
try
again
d
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
the
740ml
bottle
but
its
not
bad
however
i
would
not
rush
out
and
pick
up
another
this
probably
wasnt
worth
the
fairly
high
price
tag
10
because
theres
nothing
extraordinary
there
what
a
wild
ride
if
youll
pardon
the
pun
a
crazy
beer
full
of
phunk
and
character
thankyou
brett
annomyces
for
adding
an
entirely
new
dimension
to
the
beer
spectrum
ommegang
has
done
it
again
great
brew
whats
with
the
revelations
you
say
i
dont
know
whats
with
the
hiroshima
pic
though
is
that
ever
cool
wheat
bland
with
mild
sour
and
storng
carbonation
dry
woodiness
or
straw
dried
out
leather
stuck
on
a
dry
tongue
light
body
and
light
zesty
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
very
edit
i
added
points
to
drinkability
as
this
beer
is
quite
good
especially
when
it
warms
but
it
really
doesnt
have
as
much
of
that
wild
ale
characteristic
that
i
love
brewery
ommegang
ommegeddon
pours
a
peachish
orange
with
a
two
finger
frothy
white
head
the
smell
has
a
medium
strength
of
yeast
with
some
citrus
notes
in
the
background
initially
the
taste
is
dominant
of
bitter
and
yeast
its
definitely
unique
but
im
not
liking
after
the
initial
pour
the
taste
gets
better
after
about
five
to
ten
minutes
it
smooths
out
a
bit
and
becomes
quite
a
bit
less
bitter
still
its
a
bit
overwhelming
of
a
bitter
yeast
flavor
to
really
be
enjoyable
unless
thats
your
style
mouthfeel
is
good
its
medium
dense
with
a
smooth
and
mildly
carbonated
feel
overall
drinkability
is
really
pretty
weird
its
definitely
tastes
like
a
funkhouse
nice
one
timer
but
i
think
there
are
others
from
ommegang
id
get
before
this
one
drinkability
not
as
complex
or
robust
as
i
had
hoped
but
good
and
very
good
with
maytag
blue
very
bad
with
figs
from
from
wild
ale
expert
i
claim
to
be
but
this
was
a
fun
one
to
drink
nonetheless
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
wild
ales
i
have
had
a
few
but
this
seems
more
like
a
saison
to
me
not
that
that
is
bad
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
funkysour
farmhouse
style
beers
very
light
and
airytangy
interesting
taste
goes
down
nice
refreshing
crisp
nice
on
a
hot
dat
for
a
stronger
beer
this
one
was
quite
good
although
not
crazy
complex
it
may
be
a
bit
past
its
prime
ive
got
the
fresh
08
batch
in
my
cellar
and
may
crack
it
in
six
months
to
see
how
that
one
compares
still
a
damn
solid
brew
from
the
gang
overall
this
is
a
model
brew
with
hardly
a
flaw
highly
recommend
d
pretty
highly
carbonated
and
high
abv
the
taste
is
average
to
above
average
cant
really
go
much
higher
given
i
have
no
baseline
for
the
style
so
comparing
mostly
to
saison
style
pours
a
nice
unfiltered
gold
color
with
a
decent
white
head
the
nose
is
musty
a
dry
aroma
subtle
banana
the
taste
is
banana
yeasty
musty
bitter
yet
sweet
medium
body
spritzy
carbo
dry
finish
this
beer
pumps
me
up
and
makes
me
wanna
go
breaking
heads
aaaarrrgggg
d
its
complexity
makes
me
want
to
sip
at
it
but
its
so
refreshing
and
goes
down
so
smooth
definitely
an
exciting
offering
form
ommegang
pours
a
semi
cloudy
pale
golden
with
a
thin
white
film
head
aroma
is
sweet
fruit
slight
horse
blanket
and
citrus
flavor
is
lightly
spicy
light
earthy
and
a
bit
citrus
unfortunately
the
brett
does
not
shine
through
light
bodied
chewy
spicy
texture
abrupt
spicy
citrus
finish
like
a
belgian
blond
with
winelike
notes
gets
really
creamy
as
it
warms
up
slight
sourness
throughout
not
much
funk
expected
a
bit
more
out
of
the
brets
for
better
or
worse
enjoyable
if
mildly
disappointing
worth
drinking
again
though
poured
from
a
corked
bomber
i
bought
about
1
year
ago
and
rediscovered
1
day
ago
the
first
pour
is
much
clearer
than
expected
theres
a
lot
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
so
later
pours
show
some
floaties
the
beer
is
light
golden
colored
and
has
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
a
little
sour
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
oitherwise
it
smells
of
belgian
yeast
products
a
little
estery
the
taste
is
nice
i
feel
its
more
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
a
wild
ale
although
it
seems
to
have
some
wild
ale
yeast
put
in
the
main
flavors
are
lightly
tart
sourness
some
biscuit
a
touch
of
light
fruit
and
some
hoppy
bitterness
another
good
beer
from
ommegang
d
very
drinkable
everything
meshes
together
nicely
to
leave
a
good
experience
behind
thanks
again
alan
for
another
great
brew
also
the
hops
and
malt
are
much
more
vibrant
than
batch
1
a
complex
and
interesting
saison
i
find
new
flavors
in
every
sip
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
poured
a
threefinger
head
that
took
forever
to
die
because
of
constnat
carbonation
an
amber
hued
gold
with
a
mix
of
some
mild
hops
with
citric
notes
lemon
pear
and
some
sweet
malts
such
as
caramel
a
medium
body
with
good
hop
presence
that
gives
it
a
tart
somewhat
sour
taste
lemon
pear
and
apple
also
some
nuttiness
and
a
sweetness
in
there
with
some
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
molasses
and
cany
apple
abv
is
hidden
and
this
is
one
ill
have
to
have
again
d
an
enjoyable
experience
with
my
pallet
somewhat
confused
with
the
rushes
of
flavors
back
and
forth
will
have
to
revisit
after
aging
and
hopefully
on
tap
or
a
growler
next
time
i
go
upstate
d
finishing
the
bottle
was
hard
for
me
as
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
pretty
enjoyable
for
spending
an
evening
outside
on
the
porch
with
the
wife
i
might
be
interested
in
splitting
a
bottle
of
this
again
given
its
the
right
situation
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
definitely
have
one
of
these
pretty
regularly
i
am
trying
hard
to
try
all
that
ommegang
as
to
offer
because
i
am
such
a
big
fan
of
duvel
this
is
the
first
offereing
that
i
would
get
again
i
am
not
totally
familiar
with
the
style
of
american
wikd
ale
but
if
this
is
a
good
representative
then
i
will
be
giving
others
a
shot
good
combination
of
string
alcohol
masked
by
the
fruitiness
aspect
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
will
look
for
again
d
not
too
bad
for
every
once
and
a
while
but
a
bottle
every
once
and
a
while
is
great
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
smooth
texture
and
very
fine
carbonation
flavor
is
sweet
for
a
short
hit
and
then
rolls
to
grassy
and
bitter
hops
that
linger
as
well
not
too
funky
on
the
flavor
or
as
complex
a
decent
enough
beer
but
i
was
a
little
let
down
in
the
funk
department
btw
russian
river
can
start
shipping
some
bottles
anytime
very
good
for
summer
outside
light
and
enjoyable
but
with
full
flavor
thats
accessible
can
we
say
gateway
funk
drink
ability
a
overall
good
beer
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
from
a
wild
ale
but
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
o
the
funk
on
the
palate
pleasantly
sweet
light
to
moderate
malt
hops
are
very
present
sour
apple
and
tart
fruit
brett
is
starting
to
funk
it
up
a
bit
character
really
begins
to
develop
as
the
hop
nuances
alcohol
and
light
funk
begin
to
mesh
well
as
this
jeezebell
heats
up
long
dry
bitter
finish
to
really
appreciate
the
brett
in
this
bad
girl
you
would
probably
have
to
throw
her
in
a
dark
cool
closet
for
a
few
months
i
couldnt
wait
but
thats
why
i
bought
2
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
must
try
beer
it
wont
please
everyone
but
it
is
definitely
an
experience
every
beer
lover
should
try
perhaps
i
will
buy
a
bottle
to
age
and
see
if
the
hops
mellow
out
a
bit
pours
a
cloudy
orangeyellow
with
a
giant
white
foamy
head
and
a
ton
of
carbonation
the
head
is
huge
and
lasts
forever
the
smell
is
pungent
with
bananawheatclovescitrus
hopspepperand
bread
yeast
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
peppery
spicy
first
sip
then
you
can
taste
the
clovesbananaand
citrus
fruit
a
nice
tasting
beerbut
watch
the
pouryou
dont
want
the
yeast
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
mix
well
for
a
pretty
high
alcohol
beer
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
burn
a
good
decent
beerbut
i
have
to
say
i
did
expect
more
june
2007
batch
nice
golden
orange
color
huge
white
head
that
gripped
the
glass
well
light
fruity
aroma
drinks
a
lot
easier
than
i
was
expecting
pretty
dry
and
crisp
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
not
quite
as
funky
as
i
was
hoping
but
still
enjoyable
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
noncloying
and
refreshing
with
each
sip
very
easy
drinking
beer
poured
golden
into
my
duvel
tulip
with
a
bubbly
short
lived
white
head
nose
is
of
light
fruits
taste
is
very
good
a
medley
of
sweet
and
sour
fruits
apple
primarily
finishing
with
a
crisp
dry
hop
to
balance
things
out
mouthfeel
is
very
light
yet
lively
but
not
overly
smooth
as
you
would
expect
from
this
style
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
crisp
lively
beer
that
is
somewhat
complex
yet
refreshing
the
abv
is
definitely
under
the
radar
i
was
expecting
a
sour
bomb
which
has
turned
out
to
be
a
pleasant
mixture
with
a
mild
leaning
towards
the
sourness
style
is
more
belgian
strong
ale
than
anything
2
there
is
a
sticky
sourfunky
finish
which
lingers
in
my
mouth
afterwards
i
have
to
imagine
my
breath
is
kicking
luckily
the
girlfriend
is
out
for
the
evening
so
im
gonna
sit
back
and
polish
this
off
with
worrying
about
offending
another
nice
beer
ommegang
as
drinkable
as
it
is
complex
love
the
funk
factor
in
this
ale
the
body
is
the
only
area
that
i
would
like
to
see
slightly
increased
any
fan
of
wild
ales
should
have
this
one
on
their
short
list
d
this
brew
is
pretty
nice
i
wish
i
had
someone
to
share
this
with
but
it
wont
be
hard
to
polish
off
the
750
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
very
nice
notes
its
palate
makes
it
easy
to
sip
and
its
complex
aroma
and
interesting
flavor
enticed
me
to
drink
on
very
well
done
ill
hopefully
get
to
try
and
review
a
fresh
batch
of
this
soon
i
will
say
that
the
brett
flavors
and
aromas
seemed
to
pick
up
steam
on
the
second
and
third
pours
as
the
yeasttobeer
ratio
in
the
bottle
increased
batch
1
june
2007
the
label
states
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golden
color
w
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
which
never
really
settles
leaving
a
complete
coating
of
lace
in
my
ommegang
chalice
wow
interesting
aroma
smells
like
moldy
grains
sweatsocks
and
green
fruits
some
floral
hops
and
alcohol
present
as
well
taste
is
similar
to
smell
with
more
accent
on
brett
here
a
bit
sweet
and
vinous
on
the
palate
some
cereal
grain
does
come
through
midway
a
bit
of
mineral
salts
and
hot
alcohol
in
the
crisp
finish
very
dry
surprisingly
light
bodied
w
moderate
carbonation
for
the
style
an
excellent
brew
if
youre
into
bretts
anyway
very
drinkable
for
a
8
abv
worth
a
shot
follows
the
nose
is
malty
yeast
lots
of
spices
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
mostly
maltyyeasty
not
too
much
spices
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
an
easytodrink
wild
ale
doesnt
have
the
mustyfunky
punch
that
was
expected
but
could
easily
pass
as
a
fine
intro
to
style
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
certainly
worth
checking
out
though
nothing
explosive
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
a
good
beer
if
you
like
sour
beers
like
gueuze
and
lambics
i
could
have
aged
my
bottle
longer
but
i
think
its
good
the
way
it
is
fresh
overall
this
is
a
tasty
refreshing
complex
brew
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
the
price
is
pretty
steep
at
12
bucks
certainly
not
gonna
have
a
bunch
lying
around
but
for
a
celebration
or
something
super
tasty
now
and
again
yeah
pick
this
one
up
1st
batch
light
yellowgold
color
with
a
full
lasting
frothy
foam
bottle
conditioned
bretta
nose
with
loads
of
lemon
and
funk
flavor
has
mainly
been
taken
over
by
the
brettanomyces
and
is
quite
sour
notes
of
fruits
peaches
nectarines
mango
with
a
pleasant
sourness
and
low
acidity
nicely
balanced
and
really
quite
good
light
and
fluffy
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
probably
this
beers
best
quality
decent
drinkability
so
far
the
easiest
and
most
drinkable
wild
alenonfruit
lambic
ive
had
i
am
finding
that
these
styles
are
not
my
cup
of
tea
not
a
wild
ale
to
me
because
the
tart
has
still
not
developed
i
do
not
know
how
much
more
time
you
can
give
this
one
for
that
to
happen
either
not
my
thing
and
pretty
disappointed
will
not
drink
again
at
this
price
worth
trying
if
you
are
curious
but
if
you
are
expecting
something
with
a
lot
of
brett
like
a
jolly
pumpkin
or
russian
river
then
you
will
most
likely
be
let
down
when
i
was
drinking
this
beer
i
couldnt
stop
thinking
that
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
the
scent
of
a
craft
store
a
well
crafted
beer
to
be
sure
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
can
certainly
appreciate
this
beer
for
being
different
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
looking
for
something
different
what
i
was
hoping
for
was
a
super
sour
gueuzelike
brew
so
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
on
that
note
but
still
this
beer
has
some
unique
earthy
funk
that
probably
has
its
best
years
ahead
i
will
be
glad
to
try
one
again
with
some
further
aging
the
taste
is
crisp
tart
dry
very
refreshing
it
continues
fruity
and
brisk
upfront
then
moves
to
a
malty
wheat
honey
feel
the
finish
is
sour
with
a
nice
brett
character
although
it
takes
6
months
to
get
that
full
brett
character
this
is
still
a
quality
beer
this
is
a
good
wild
ale
and
a
fine
into
to
the
style
recommended
dsurprising
easy
to
drink
and
its
a
very
good
beer
has
some
funk
but
nothing
overpowering
as
the
beer
warmed
up
it
also
seemed
to
mellow
a
little
more
ommegang
ommegeddon
one
of
the
great
beer
names
of
alltime
is
a
pretty
damn
good
american
wild
ale
it
knows
when
to
push
hard
and
when
to
hold
back
unlike
most
of
the
jolly
pumpkin
brews
which
are
brettblasted
and
overattenuated
if
it
wasnt
for
the
outrageous
price
tag
i
could
drink
this
stuff
on
a
semiregular
basis
overall
i
like
the
idea
and
this
beer
has
some
good
qualities
i
just
had
a
hard
time
with
that
metal
flavor
that
came
through
d
i
drank
two
of
these
with
ease
this
one
could
please
many
different
types
of
beer
lovers
nice
glad
i
could
try
not
really
a
great
gateway
to
funky
beers
although
itd
be
fun
to
introduce
this
first
and
then
pull
something
really
funky
to
see
if
the
taster
can
then
return
and
pull
those
notes
out
of
this
beer
this
is
not
insane
brettanomyces
armageddon
as
label
and
name
seem
to
promise
for
anyone
already
into
duvel
and
other
great
but
easytodrink
belgians
this
would
be
an
excellent
gateway
to
the
wild
world
of
yeast
funk
i
wanted
a
ton
more
stinky
dirtysock
sweat
craziness
and
ended
up
just
as
pleased
with
the
depth
of
flavor
and
amazing
balance
on
display
delicious
one
of
ommegangs
best
mfd
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
enjoyable
d
very
nice
and
tasty
i
am
impressed
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
one
id
get
again
ommegeddon
doesnt
have
the
massive
brett
funk
that
other
wild
ales
mo
betta
bretta
comes
to
mind
as
does
some
russian
river
brews
do
but
its
still
a
tasty
offering
worth
picking
up
drinkability
ill
definately
buy
this
one
again
but
buyer
beware
the
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
all
and
all
a
good
brew
pours
hazy
golden
with
an
airy
one
finger
of
snow
white
head
terrific
ripe
fruit
aromas
of
apple
pear
and
lemon
while
yeast
characters
come
through
lightly
and
then
faint
notes
of
straw
oak
and
brandy
spiciness
jumps
out
right
away
pepper
clove
coriander
and
becomes
super
dry
and
bitter
the
brett
offers
a
gritty
earthy
mossy
like
funk
tart
green
apples
lemon
pith
vinous
character
thats
nearly
vinegary
and
a
suggestion
of
juniper
berry
crisp
champagne
carbonation
overall
a
very
deep
beer
and
distinguishably
brett
complex
and
satisfying
pours
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
with
tons
of
bubbles
smells
like
bananas
circus
peanuts
and
a
lingering
herbal
note
that
is
subtle
the
nose
wasnt
as
nearly
as
intense
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
and
actually
is
fairly
good
the
palate
shows
more
of
a
tart
herbal
characteristic
which
follows
what
everyone
should
think
before
drinking
this
beer
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
overthetop
but
masks
a
little
bit
of
the
funk
clovesspices
and
funk
roll
up
at
the
finish
and
slap
your
buds
so
youre
ready
to
battle
preemptively
i
wouldnt
ask
for
another
pour
but
this
beer
matches
up
to
what
its
supposed
to
be
and
i
can
respect
that
overall
this
one
doesnt
quite
bring
the
funk
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
bad
beer
its
actually
very
good
but
it
isnt
what
it
is
advertised
to
be
either
complex
yes
funky
not
so
much
my
scores
will
show
that
this
is
in
fact
a
good
beer
but
if
you
are
looking
for
some
funk
i
would
recommend
something
else
at
this
point
maybe
with
some
more
age
it
will
truly
be
funky
still
it
is
drinking
very
good
right
now
d
for
a
wild
ale
of
this
strength
its
incredibly
drinkable
d
definitely
a
keeper
too
bad
its
not
more
available
maybe
ill
get
some
treats
from
him
now
that
hes
over
at
new
glarus
the
next
unplugged
is
a
berliner
wiesse
my
first
sniff
was
full
of
a
strange
citrus
like
smell
im
not
sure
what
the
underlying
scents
were
that
threw
off
the
citrus
but
it
was
certainly
complex
now
that
my
beer
has
warmed
theres
a
decided
funky
yeast
smell
the
brett
i
assume
that
reminds
me
of
ripe
blue
cheese
yummy
it
tastes
great
with
a
sharp
bitterness
up
front
that
fades
into
a
citrus
peel
flavor
i
cant
quite
peg
what
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
at
the
moment
the
mouthfeel
is
sparkling
and
bubbly
not
heavy
at
all
but
still
coating
the
mouth
nicely
i
think
i
could
drink
very
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
especially
since
it
seems
to
be
changing
even
more
as
it
warms
up
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
wants
to
try
something
off
the
beaten
path
notes
bottle
says
batch
1
july
2008
and
i
drank
it
earlier
this
evening
4908
it
went
great
with
chicken
and
several
cheeses
ranging
from
sharp
to
subtle
pours
hazed
yellowish
orange
with
a
small
filmy
white
head
smell
is
light
and
dusty
bretty
and
some
faintly
sweet
malt
taste
is
mild
and
dusty
with
faintly
tart
malt
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
and
a
mild
bretty
influence
medium
bodied
and
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
pretty
nice
stuff
this
is
a
fine
beer
im
not
sure
its
for
everyone
i
know
plenty
of
folks
who
just
dont
enjoy
brettbeers
but
i
do
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
hybrid
beer
combining
the
funky
flavors
of
the
wild
ales
with
a
dry
hoppy
belgian
golden
ale
really
nice
at
8
abv
its
not
too
big
either
a
quality
sipping
beer
that
could
easily
serve
as
a
substitute
for
a
white
wine
just
as
it
could
be
an
afterdinner
nightcap
d
8
abv
drinks
like
a
4
until
you
stand
up
ridiculous
drinkability
is
the
strong
point
of
this
brew
but
in
all
honesty
i
was
expecting
bolder
flavours
this
poured
a
hazy
light
gold
with
fluffy
white
head
it
smelled
like
a
fairly
typical
belgian
with
sour
yeast
and
lemon
scents
it
tasted
like
lemon
hops
and
grass
i
e
lawn
clippings
it
had
decent
bitterness
but
not
a
very
clean
flavor
it
was
watery
and
very
carbonated
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
not
a
great
beer
but
it
was
tolerable
d
a
great
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
as
soon
as
possible
while
tasting
i
sampled
some
italian
sausage
that
paired
perfect
with
this
style
an
almost
glowing
yellow
holden
body
hosts
an
off
white
head
that
only
reaches
about
one
finger
even
with
a
strong
pour
fades
to
just
a
skim
in
a
couple
of
minutes
nose
is
a
doughy
mix
of
soft
fresh
fruit
and
raw
wheat
there
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
also
enters
the
mouth
realatively
smooth
without
the
sharp
sour
that
i
would
expect
from
the
style
a
bit
of
wheat
mixes
with
a
nice
hop
profile
and
glides
thru
the
mouth
with
just
a
bit
of
sour
feel
wraped
around
an
almost
pilsner
like
bitter
feel
i
really
dont
think
the
brett
bacteria
has
really
taken
its
true
effect
yet
mouthfeel
is
very
much
of
a
german
style
and
dry
feel
solid
drinking
brew
maybe
it
should
have
had
a
little
higher
dose
of
the
brett
or
needs
longer
in
the
bottle
im
not
complaining
though
since
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
sour
beers
try
it
youll
like
it
overall
not
my
favorite
wild
in
the
world
but
its
a
great
american
offering
of
this
belgian
classic
ommegang
knows
what
they
are
doing
label
notes
recommended
for
now
or
up
to
2
years
from
the
release
given
the
mild
acidity
and
funky
flavors
id
be
inclined
to
try
this
again
at
2
years
very
mild
intro
to
the
wild
category
at
this
stage
of
bottle
conditioning
a
pretty
solid
brew
with
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
for
me
that
made
the
bottle
a
full
enjoyment
through
although
still
much
more
of
sipper
then
something
i
could
swig
alot
of
easily
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
when
it
comes
to
this
kind
of
brett
induced
beer
d
i
love
ommegang
for
trying
but
to
me
this
one
comes
up
a
bit
short
gotta
love
the
name
though
looks
like
a
belgian
blond
alle
translucen
straw
with
chunks
of
yeast
floating
around
moderate
carbonation
with
a
short
head
in
a
goblet
nose
is
sort
of
sweet
and
funky
from
the
yeast
taste
is
sickly
sweet
hard
to
decide
what
sort
of
sweet
flavors
are
in
there
but
the
hops
and
funkiness
show
overpowering
the
sweetness
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
not
sure
if
i
like
it
or
not
but
again
it
is
a
wild
ale
so
i
guess
its
fairly
wild
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
wild
ale
and
good
entry
for
those
not
familiar
with
the
style
a
outstanding
beer
and
recommend
d
it
required
a
great
deal
of
patience
but
sitting
on
the
beer
was
worth
it
the
brett
profile
has
really
come
through
adding
a
dry
tartness
to
the
ale
that
is
quite
funky
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
ring
with
some
lacing
smells
a
little
musty
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
some
sour
lemon
taste
is
a
little
funky
with
some
malt
and
yeast
flavors
there
is
a
sour
citrus
mostly
lemon
this
is
my
first
wild
ale
with
brett
so
i
dont
know
what
to
really
expect
hopefully
this
one
will
get
better
with
age
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
with
some
oily
residue
the
drinkability
is
great
with
no
alcohol
really
present
ill
have
to
let
the
other
one
go
for
awhile
but
it
will
be
hard
not
to
drink
i
think
the
beer
is
okay
but
i
think
nowadays
when
someone
is
marketing
a
sour
beer
it
should
be
a
little
more
bold
maybe
more
age
would
allow
the
brett
more
time
to
work
on
this
this
was
batch
1
from
june
07
this
is
a
very
pale
beer
that
is
relying
totally
on
the
brett
to
make
it
good
and
i
just
dont
think
the
character
is
there
yet
even
though
i
say
that
i
guess
it
is
fairly
drinkable
given
its
more
subdued
flavor
and
light
body
to
wrap
it
up
easy
to
drink
but
not
overly
memorable
nice
well
done
but
not
excellent
worthwhile
nonetheless
still
struggling
with
my
palates
aversion
to
this
and
related
styles
flanders
oud
bruin
goudenband
review
forthcoming
may
have
been
the
breakthrough
this
isnt
my
favorite
thing
in
the
world
but
i
can
respect
it
and
im
definitely
buying
a
bottle
to
cellar
for
a
greater
length
given
how
much
this
has
evolved
in
6
months
bottle

of
hogtownharry
poured
a
light
golden
yellow
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
light
brett
with
some
very
minor
notes
of
horse
blanket
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
light
sour
notes
with
some
brett
notes
and
light
horse
blanket
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
some
good
carbonation
what
a
big
disappointment
from
the
rave
reviews
i
was
reading
2
or
3
years
ago
brett
character
is
really
too
subtle
and
hops
presence
was
not
as
i
was
expecting
it
not
sure
when
this
was
bottled
but
ive
been
holding
onto
it
for
four
to
five
months
so
its
got
to
have
a
bit
more
age
on
that
by
now
pours
a
light
dirty
gold
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
fades
to
a
tenacious
collar
the
aroma
is
fairly
light
although
it
does
display
some
nice
barnyard
elements
and
a
touch
of
citrus
theres
also
a
warm
vague
spiciness
that
i
expect
is
a
yeast
artifact
on
the
palate
wonderfully
soft
barnyard
off
the
bat
with
funky
citrus
wrapped
in
hops
oils
coming
up
at
the
midpalate
very
dry
with
no
residual
sweetness
left
and
a
finish
that
is
mouthencompassing
with
intense
tingles
big
carbonation
throughout
along
with
potent
lemony
acidity
that
never
gets
too
harsh
overall
this
is
almost
fantastic
i
must
say
that
letting
this
sit
for
five
months
plus
was
a
good
idea
its
dry
but
still
soft
which
for
a
wild
ale
is
a
precious
combination
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
its
an
interesting
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
thr
brett
as
someone
else
said
earlier
it
does
taste
like
a
duvel
to
me
though
not
as
good
i
have
had
this
on
the
tap
a
couple
of
different
times
and
it
was
different
each
time
both
in
colour
and
flavour
im
hoping
it
gravitates
more
towards
the
first
time
i
had
it
on
tap
in
future
brewings
previously
it
was
hazy
orange
with
much
orange
rind
and
lots
of
brett
i
suppose
only
time
and
the
next
batch
from
the
ommegang
brewers
will
tell
really
not
all
that
wild
unless
ive
developed
a
tolerance
to
it
i
detect
very
little
brett
character
tasty
but
not
quite
as
advertised
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
afternoon
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
pretty
interesting
brew
and
relatively
complex
definitely
worth
a
try
once
d
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
at
all
just
not
very
impressed
with
it
compared
to
other
wild
ales
i
have
had
a
favorite
of
2007
for
myself
at
the
steel
city
big
pour
fest
i
had
a
fun
time
sampling
this
funkdified
brew
i
found
it
comparable
to
green
apples
and
pussy
sorry
to
get
graphic
but
it
fits
this
brew
perfectly
appears
a
cloudy
golden
hue
bright
tight
white
fine
bubbled
head
fine
even
belgian
style
lacing
aromatics
massive
deep
tropical
fruit
notes
like
pineapple
star
fruit
and
mango
with
tart
acidic
yogurt
like
notes
from
the
brettanomyces
added
spicy
flowing
yeast
notes
with
dry
musty
grape
seed
earthy
qualities
and
fresh
cut
green
apple
aka
a
touch
of
diacetyl
flavor
brings
of
the
funky
with
some
hard
cider
mild
tart
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
qualities
soft
powdered
vanilla
added
into
plain
creamy
yogurt
with
a
mild
chalky
over
ripened
fruit
thing
going
on
finishes
dry
and
spicy
with
the
yeast
kickin
you
in
the
balls
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nothing
overdone
or
rough
on
the
palate
dry
puckering
tartness
in
the
finish
with
a
lactic
apples
and
cream
tartness
carbonation
flows
so
smooth
drinkability
so
sessionable
and
complex
i
need
to
track
down
some
more
bottles
and
sit
on
them
to
let
the
bret
flourish
looks
promising
enough
with
a
slightly
hazy
gold
body
which
i
figure
is
appropriate
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
light
with
a
balanced
mix
of
pale
grains
and
mellow
funk
in
the
flavor
there
hardly
seems
to
be
any
funk
to
be
found
theres
a
small
but
crisp
bite
of
hops
which
is
nice
but
this
beer
is
way
too
mild
sure
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
it
shouldnt
be
this
easy
its
like
a
im
drinking
a
bland
duvel
funky
aroma
although
levels
off
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
very
light
colour
with
white
head
very
little
spices
other
than
pepper
like
a
cantillon
unfermented
ale
wild
ale
and
not
harsh
on
the
palate
slightly
acidic
requiring
food
but
no
different
taste
by
course
this
beer
was
a
hazy
light
caramel
colour
maybe
closer
to
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
cap
as
the
fine
bubbles
settled
to
a
thin
skim
it
left
thick
sticky
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
full
of
funk
wet
straw
a
bit
of
tartness
grassy
and
lemony
hops
same
in
the
flavour
but
with
a
light
malt
sweetness
and
a
mild
citrussourness
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
one
was
smooth
and
tasty
the
funkiness
brett
hasnt
taken
the
beer
over
yet
so
the
balance
is
still
quite
nice
itll
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
beer
develops
over
time
though
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
about
a
finger
of
bone
white
head
aroma
is
pleasant
but
very
subdued
i
detect
some
light
maltiness
honey
belgian
yeast
some
banana
and
clove
esters
and
a
bit
of
brett
funkyness
taste
is
good
again
it
is
a
bit
subdued
the
brett
funk
is
more
pronounced
here
than
in
the
aroma
but
still
doesnt
overwhelm
it
is
accompanied
by
some
maltiness
peppery
phenols
and
slight
sourness
mouthfeel
is
good
lightmedium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
the
flavors
are
interesting
for
a
glass
or
two
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
that
overall
an
interesting
brew
thats
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
a
cloudy
golden
big
fluffy
white
head
forms
tons
of
lacing
really
pretty
solid
layer
smell
is
neat

we
have

bottles
to
open
when
the
brett
really
takes
a
hold
thanks
russ
a
highly
drinkable
beer
reminds
me
of
a
saison
with
a
bit
more
wild
character
i
hope
to
run
across
this
beer
in
the
future
slightly

in
the

flashes

bitter
hops
very
nice
medium
body
with
an
almost
creamy
feel
despite
strong
carbonation
very
drinkable
for
8
in
the
end
i
really
like
this
beer
despite
the
fact
that
i
think
it
is
a
failure
as
a
beer
that
is
so
prominently
advertised
as
with
brettanomyces
hopefully
that
will
come
with
time
but
i
strongly
suggest
that
next
time
they
age
it
in
bulk
with
the
brett
before
bottling
like
was
done
for
the
initial
draught
release
d
a
nice
drinkable
beer
the
alcohol
taste
tapered
off
later
on
in
the
session
easy
smooth
mouthfeel
and
nice
balanced
taste
made
it
a
very
drinable
beer
drinkability
not
as
wild
as
many
of
the
great
belgian
wild
ales
or
those
from
russian
river
nevertheless
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
funk
and
to
have
a
funky
element
to
an
otherwise
tasty
beer
is
just
about
right
for
me
tastes
of
fruits
apples
berries
more
spices
and
a
bit
of
barn
yard
funk
this
is
not
my
favorite
wild
ale
but
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
a
couple
of
times
for
that
matter
i
wish
i
had
a
bottle
to
age
heavy
and
matted
in
texture
but
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
has
some
good
warmth
in
it
the
lingering
sediment
induced
feel
is
a
suitable
end
different
and
interesting
for
sure
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
sip
lacks
the
pop
and
big
flavors
that
i
have
tasted
in
the
russian
river
wild
ales
but
this
is
still
pretty
good
with
that
said
i
will
pass
on
this
the
next
time
ill
save
my
money
for
the
next
trip

no
matter
where
i
go
whenever
i
see
ommegeddon
on
tap
its
a
must
order
good
fullbodied
brew
with
under
control
carbonation
a
nice
enough
drinking
saisson
although
one
that
certainly
needs
a
few
additional
months
of
aging
this
is
from
the
initial
summer
brewing
body
is
light
airey
and
slick
a
highly
approachable
wild
ale
that
has
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
a
breakthrough
beer
for
ommegang
all
of
their
releases
are
good
this
one
puts
them
up
with
the
best
and
most
daring
belgian
brewers
drinkability
this
isnt
that
bad
for
a
wild
ale
the
flavor
was
okay
i
just
wish
that
the
scent
was
bolder
and
had
more
of
the
brettanomyces
flavor
it
tastes
almost
like
a
witbier
on
steroids
while
it
was
good
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
very
often
not
that
i
could
anyway
since
they
dont
sell
this
here
in
texas
there
are
better
bigger
bolder
wild
ales
to
search
out
such
as
la
roja
and
more
importantly
pretty
much
half
of
russian
rivers
offerings
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
this
past
summer
while
at
the
brewery
and
felt
that
the
gathering
of
friends
here
would
be
the
perfect
time
to
break
it
out
and
give
it
a
try
while
i
did
have
a
few
samples
while
at
the
brewery
and
felt
that
this
was
simply
an
excellent
brew
i
was
having
a
hard
time
remembering
it
the
brew
poured
to
a
somewhat
light
yellowgolden
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
that
had
great
retention
leaving
some
chunks
along
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aromas
gave
a
slight
noticeable
citric
scent
from
the
start
also
in
there
is
a
pepper
spice
sweet
honey
and
some
fruit
aromas
that
really
make
this
brew
inviting
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
some
nice
funkiness
setting
in
that
seems
to
give
a
slight
souring
taste
along
with
a
spiciness
that
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
than
peppery
this
is
a
nice
brew
glad
that
i
picked
this
up
while
visiting
the
brewery
this
past
summer
and
the
flavors
brought
it
all
back
to
me
hope
that
they
would
continue
to
make
this
in
the
future
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
finish
is
semidry
on
this
one
at
first
the
tongue
has
a
slick
finish
while
the
soft
palate
has
a
dry
finish
over
time
the
tongue
dries
out
giving
this
brew
a
much
drier
finish
in
the
long
run
the
brew
has
a
mediumlight
body
with
appropriate
levels
of
carbonation
not
hard
to
drink
but
this
isnt
something
that
i
think
ill
buy
again
nothing
all
that
special
to
it
dont
get
me
wrong
its
good
but
ill
be
trying
others
before
coming
back
to
this
one
as
this
beer
is
my
introduction
to
the
style
i
think
that
itll
take
a
few
more
of
this
style
until
i
can
fully
appreciate
the
style
and
understand
what
is
going
on
inside
the
brew
carbonation
is
fine
and
prickly
body
is
a
shade
thin
of
medium
a
bit
acrid
in
the
finish
not
ommegangs
best
drinkability
is
very
good
enjoyable
funky
fruity
earthy
hoppy
yeasty
goodness
a
little
pricey
but
defiantly
worth
a
try
and
a
retry
in
my
book
md
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
other
wild
ales
to
compare
the
style
but
i
like
this
its
easy
to
drink
especially
for
all
the
unique
flavors
ommegang
knows
how
to
brew
gold
colored
pour
aroma
of
mud
and
wild
yeast
very
nice
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
very
pleasant
citrus
taste
throughout
both
upfront
and
on
the
finish
i
like
it
a
lot
there
have
been
versions
of
this
i
have
tried
at
fests
that
could
have
won
best
in
show
there
is
definite
room
for
improvement
but
i
am
quite
pleased
that
they
tried
bottling
this
this
is
the
first
time
ive
seen
this
one
bottled
stillextremely
drinkable
considering
the
abv
edit
113008
original
bottling
1
year
after
the
initial
tasting
of
this
beer
im
not
going
to
change
my
ratings
at
all
for
this
the
brett
is
only
a
tad
more
evident
but
not
enough
to
warrant
any
major
change
from
the
characteristics
originally
detected
if
anything
i
would
call
this
a
pretty
good
saison
but
certainly
not
a
wild
ale
pale
pale
almost
peach
color
slight
fluffy
head
basic
earthy
and
sulfury
smell
some
wet
or
stale
cardboard
but
not
the
funk
i
was
expecting
good
flavor
sour
and
off
flavor
that
is
quite
nice
i
have
had
few
wild
beers
before
so
i
assume
this
is
the
brett
mild
citrusy
notes
decent
mouthfeelquite
dry
actually
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
different
and
pleasant
experience
overall
nice
to
try
something
different
and
find
it
this
good
going
to
cellar
a
bottle
as
recommended
to
bring
out
some
more
funk
d
i
like
the
aroma
but
from
the
flavor
it
just
seems
like
they
couldnt
decide
were
to
go
with
it
once
again
ommegang
lets
me
down
and
not
a
surprise
just
mad
i
spend
20
on
this
bottle
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
that
is
on
the
higher
side
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
beer
that
takes
chances
this
one
is
bitter
and
funky
it
reminds
me
of
changing
small
belgian
brews
that
seem
to
be
regularly
different
i
have
no
idea
whether
or
not
this
beer
will
be
different
the
next
time
i
drink
it
there
will
be
a
next
time
but
when
i
drink
something
that
is
circumstantially
satisfying
i
am
pleased
ive
drank
a
lot
of
beer
i
know
safe
when
i
taste
it
this
isnt
safe
its
tasty
drinkability
is
great
i
expected
more
funk
and
sourness
but
found
a
nice
balanced
and
very
drinkable
belgian
pale
that
said
im
really
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
one
develop
and
funkify
with
time
drinkability
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
for
but
still
turned
out
to
be
a
quality
beer
that
i
would
pick
up
again

if
the
price
wasnt
so
prohibitive
this
would
be
a
great
brew
to
have
more
often
dyou
definitely
need
to
like
this
type
of
beer
or
it
would
probably
fall
low
on
your
totem
not
a
beer
for
everyone
but
i
really
like
it
and
am
so
happy
that
a
bigger
craft
brewer
like
ommegang
is
going
wild
hazy
golden
maybe
darker
nose
of
slightly
mineral
minty
sour
brett
flavor
is
almost
like
the
rinse
and
spit
cup
at
the
dentists
office
in
a
very
good
and
intriguing
way
i
have
never
tasted
the
brett
character
quite
as
refined
and
focused
this
way
clean
malt
with
a
little
straw
character
this
is
very
classy
and
sharp
little
actual
sourness
funk
but
more
minty
earthy
with
the
brett
funk
staying
behind
a
bit
yet
infusing
throughout
winemakers
wont
want
to
come
within
20
yards
of
this
but
for
the
rest
of
us
this
would
be
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
not
completely
hidden
by
a
long
shot
similar
to
a
triple
but
a
very
drinkable
triple
another
outstanding
effort
from
ommegang
i
have
another
bottle
should
probably
let
it
sit
for
a
while
but
it
will
be
tough
to
not
open
it
we
shared
a
bottle
during
a
byob
sarod
and
tabla
concert
i
knew
id
rather
have
it
with
some
food
but
found
it
to
be
a
nice
pairing
to
the
music
it
is
as
these
things
go
a
bit
of
a
peculiar
brew
its
rather
saisony
with
the
added
brett
pleasantly
complex
but
not
overly
tremendous
or
anything
i
wont
trade
in
the
euro
wild
beers
for
this
but
id
have
it
again
sure
cost
is
reasonable
nice
effort
from
ommegang
i
got
a
bottle
in
september
it
poor
s
nice
cloudy
smell
refreshing
a
tasted
good
with
a
taste
of
ethyl
that
was
no
surprise
as
it
is
supposed
to
the
taste
was
well
balanced
the
taste
the
ethyl
the
aroma
great
beer
i
split
the
bottle
with
a
cousin
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
saison
but
with
a
lot
more
character
and
varied
taste
a
great
brew
from
ommegang
almost
on
par
with
hennepin
dont
drink
and
review
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
somewhat
clear
golden
amber
it
did
not
have
much
head
but
this
could
have
been
a
result
of
the
bartender
letting
it
settle
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
citrus
hint
flavor
is
rich
mainly
malty
with
a
good
hoppy
nip
and
something
of
an
alcohol
bite
aftertaste
is
smooth
but
edgy
poured
in
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed
a
14
white
head
over
the
cloudy
golden
brew
head
falls
relatively
quickly
and
lace
is
delicate
and
falls
rapidly
aroma
is
light
spicing
and
pale
sweetness
with
an
undercurrent
of
funk
taste
follows
the
nose
except
there
is
a
tartness
that
rides
under
it
all
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
quite
pleasing
this
one
comes
off
at
this
stage
as
reasonably
approachable
perhaps
a
starter
funk
brew
who
knows
what
some
age
would
do
overall
a
nice
treat
that
ill
look
out
for
drinkability
id
say
this
brew
is
very
middle
of
the
road
in
its
creation
newbies
to
the
style
could
easily
approach
this
beer
without
much
trepidation
i
myself
would
prefer
to
age
it
for
a
few
years
to
see
where
the
brett
takes
it
maybe
the
hops
would
drop
out
and
the
funk
would
dominate
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
14
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
mild
sourness
the
belgian
yeast
and
the
hops
blend
nicely
with
one
another
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
plain
taste
to
it
there
are
pale
malts
and
belgian
yeast
esters
along
with
a
nice
warming
in
the
finish
the
brett
yeast
is
very
faint
as
well
as
the
hops
its
a
good
drinker
with
a
dry
earthy
element
but
it
really
doesnt
knock
me
over
like
i
was
expecting
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinker
it
has
some
subtle
complexities
but
i
was
expecting
more
however
this
is
a
fine
offering
but
probably
thier
weakest
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
pale
orange
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
nice
cap
leaving
some
nice
chunky
lacing
the
smell
is
of
lemon
and
apples
white
pepper
and
very
light
coriander
a
nice
light
belgian
funk
smell
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
hints
of
lemon
honey
and
pear
light
grainy
malt
and
grassy
hop
the
feel
is
moderate
and
fizzy
well
balanced
and
finishes
with
a
very
subtle
sourness
alcohol
is
well
hidden
another
great
brew
from
a
great
brewery
a
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
zing
and
some
light
characteristics
of
a
saison
ok
short
review
not
as
good
as
hennepin
longer
summary
the
brett
seems
to
kill
the
spirit
of
the
beer
here
it
doesnt
taste
bad
exactly
it
just
isnt
as
good
as
its
older
brother
hennepin
appearance
is
nice
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
moderate
head
floral
aroma
funky
in
a
grassy
sense
not
too
horse
blankety
at
all
at
all
taste
is
a
bit
of
sharp
funk
and
alcohol
up
front
but
it
eases
back
into
that
nice
heennepin
taste
very
quickly
and
remains
that
way
for
the
rest
of
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
good
blend
of
carbonation
and
smoothness
that
again
reminds
me
of
their
saison
drinkability
is
good
but
the
alcohol
comes
through
a
bit
acutally
this
reminds
me
very
much
of
how
avec
les
bon
voux
sp
compares
to
the
regular
dupont
that
being
said
at
12
dollars
a
bottle
id
rather
buy
2
hennepins
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
special
im
afraid
overall
i
was
more
then
impressed
with
this
one
it
really
gave
me
a
good
feeling
and
was
by
far
my
favorite
ommegang
brew
to
date
now
this
was
a
different
kind
of
belgian
for
me
something
that
was
light
fruitier
and
hoppier
then
what
i
normally
associate
and
i
loved
every
minute
of
it
i
really
have
to
find
me
way
to
get
more
of
this
as
soon
as
i
can
this
could
easily
become
one
of
my
more
favorite
brews
definitely
need
to
get
ahold
of
this
one
if
you
can
really
well
put
together
and
honestly
almost
a
new
style
entirely
highly
recommended
d
this
brew
was
goodbut
it
still
has
a
long
way
to
go
i
wish
i
would
have
taken
the
time
to
age
it
properly
i
love
what
ommegang
comes
up
with
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
chocolate
indulgence
what
it
becomes
available
thanks
to
dispholidus1
for
bringing
this
to
mcd

is

notes
that

it
warms
lemony

acid
taste
with
a
notquite
fully
developed
brett
character
quite
sour
on
the
finish
medium
bodied
nice
moderately
complex
enjoyable
beer
d
i
usually
love
wild
ales
but
not
this
one
the
flavor
is
lacking
any
sort
of
complexity
and
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
ill
pass
on
this
next
time
d
tasty
and
intriguing
not
quite
as
tart
as
expected
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
shallow
bubbly
white
head
that
fades
quickly
with
little
lacing
left
behind
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
that
is
not
easily
disturbed
the
smell
is
a
solid
fresh
bright
belgian
yeast
with
lemony
citrus
character
lightmedium
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
and
supplemented
by
a
tingle
of
bitterness
on
the
roof
and
tip
of
the
tongue
the
flavor
begins
brightly
as
a
tart
lemon
the
mouth
finishes
dry
and
remnants
of
the
sour
taste
linger
appropriately
i
dont
favor
beverages
that
have
a
dry
finish
but
id
recommend
trying
this
one
out
while
well
hidden
in
the
muoth
the
8
abv
is
real
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
one
but
im
just
not
that
impressed
id
take
supplication
or
la
roja
over
this
one
any
day
of
the
week
in
addition
this
is
considerably
more
expensive
than
other
ommegang
beers
like
almost
3
times
the
cost
which
i
find
a
little
odd
that
being
said
it
is
a
well
made
beer
and
im
happy
to
see
ommegang
trying
something
new
id
recommend
others
to
try
it
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
buy
another
bottle
pours
a
nice
glowing
peachy
color
with
a
thinner
off
white
head
first
aroma
i
noticed
immediately
was
a
flintygunpowder
kind
of
earthy
aroma
with
a
background
of
skunk
i
mean
the
animal
not
lightstrickenness
not
offputting
but
a
little
unusual
the
bottle
we
were
splitting
was
pretty
green
so
id
assume
some
aromas
will
mellow
with
age
flavor
was
mostly
hop
bitterness
upfront
a
bit
of
orangy
sweetnesscitrusiness
nearer
the
finish
maybe
some
touches
of
spearmint
leaves
very
earthy
as
it
warmed
the
alcohol
showed
up
a
little
more
and
the
finish
could
be
described
a
being
a
bit
like
hairspray
a
pretty
nice
beer
that
ill
be
sure
to
try
agian
after
it
has
some
age
behind
it
ill
need
to
pick
up
another
to
cellar
and
compare
pours
a
cloudy
orangeish
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
a
dry
tartness
and
a
belgian
yeastiness
in
the
taste
hops
upfront
and
a
tart
yeastiness
a
smooth
small
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
with
a
hoppy
tart
aftertaste
a
nice
tartness
with
hops
although
i
think
it
needs
more
age
it
does
get
more
balance
when
it
warms
up
i
was
excited
to
hear
about
this
beer
and
i
hope
that
the
wide
distribution
of
ommegang
will
help
increase
the
appreciation
of
the
style
while
this
beer
is
not
all
that
sour
now
another
year
in
the
botttle
should
help
the
brett
do
its
work
ill
try
it
again
then
as
well
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
moderate
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
lacing
is
slight
the
smell
is
an
interestinginterplay
of
brett
sourness
and
barnyard
slightly
sweet
malt
and
some
floral
notes
the
taste
is
very
interesting
as
well
the
combination
of
brett
and
bitter
hops
makes
an
interesting
pairing
fruity
and
a
little
sour
up
front
then
a
long
citrusy
bitterness
from
the
hops
followed
by
a
faint
floral
and
bready
sweetness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
relatively
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
great
each
sip
gives
you
something
new
and
it
goes
down
easy
8
abv
cant
tell
my
favorite
offering
from
this
brewery
so
far
very
well
done
this
was
probably
too
young
as
the
brett
has
not
fully
emerged
but
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
nonetheless
not
sure
what
all
the
talk
is
about
on
this
one
thin
and
lacking
complexity
i
could
drink
it
long
and
often
but
just
missing
something
for
me
a
slight
sweet
tart
sugar
thick
white
pepper
with
the
same
lemony
rind
a
good
showing
of
alcohol
in
the
chest
with
a
puckery
finish
a
nice
drinker
but
nothing
id
go
search
for
it
seems
that
i
could
not
wait
until
i
got
my
hands
on
this
beer
finally
available
on
the
shelves
of
central
ky
retailer
shelves
although
the
lable
suggests
to
celler
this
beer
for
6
months
2
years
hell
with
it
i
drink
now
the
beer
opens
with
an
airy
and
carbonated
pour
into
the
chalice
a
brightly
colored
canary
yellow
brew
chased
an
airy
rocky
head
quickly
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
head
settles
to
a
film
and
lasts
the
session
no
hints
of
thickness
or
gravity
but
a
thin
look
of
champaign
with
a
solid
beer
look
aromas
of
mild
pilsner
malts
and
aggresive
dryhopping
set
the
tone
for
a
very
tart
slight
of
sour
vineous
berry
woodsy
sweaty
funky
goodness
character
flavors
skipped
right
by
a
mild
sweetness
and
right
to
a
very
complex
yeast
estery
peppery
musty
bitter
citrus
concoction
all
rolled
into
tastes
of
lemons
grannysmith
apples
good
pilsner
malty
flavors
earthy
grassy
hops
a
touch
of
dish
soap
flavors
ride
on
the
edge
of
complexity
deterant
finishes
very
airy
and
soft
with
a
background
astringency
and
increasing
sourness
the
brett
yeast
certainly
has
a
grip
on
this
beer
but
leaves
a
lot
of
hearty
beer
character
to
be
enjoyed
this
beer
is
certainly
on
par
with
the
best
of
jolly
pumpkins
cant
wait
til
this
bottle
matures
this
is
a
fine
wild
ale
and
one
i
would
suggest
newcomers
try
before
moving
on
to
weirder
stuff
di
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
be
coming
back
for
more
d
very
smooth
and
easy
and
disappeared
easily
even
with
8
hiding
in
it
drinkability
crisp
tasty
with
a
refreshing
dryness
in
the
finish
excellent
drinkability
would
be
an
excellent
pairing
with
poultry
or
light
fish
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
left
almost
no
webbing
strong
citrus
smell
with
hints
of
sour
fruits
maybe
and
some
pepper
the
taste
is
wheaty
dry
not
too
hoppy
like
the
smell
it
has
citrus
and
sour
fruit
overall
pretty
good
pretty
refreshing
and
a
very
solid
beer
ommegang
doesnt
disappoint
a
unique
blend
of
an
american
wild
ale
and
dry
hopping
that
i
think
did
not
blend
well
together
bland
very
phenolic
with
intense
spiciness
at
times
interesting
to
try
but
not
one
i
would
go
back
to
d
highly
drinkable
this
beer
could
make
a
good
introduction
to
the
world
of
wild
beers
for
an
uninitiated
craft
beer
drinker
it
is
easily
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
funky
brettanomyces
character
without
being
too
sour
or
earthy
the
dry
hopping
made
for
an
interesting
beer
but
i
cant
quite
decide
if
it
was
successful
in
this
case
on
one
hand
the
hop
flavor
seems
to
accentuate
the
earthiness
of
the
wild
yeast
but
at
the
same
time
i
cant
help
but
think
that
the
hop
flavor
may
be
so
strong
that
it
masks
some
of
the
complexity
of
the
yeast
and
leaves
the
beer
a
bit
unbalanced
in
any
case
i
plan
to
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
and
let
it
age
for
six
months
or
so
to
see
how
the
character
develops
my
first
foray
into
the
american
wild
ale
territory
to
be
honest
iam
not
a
big
fan
of
the
funk
but
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
style
for
some
time
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
a
slight
hazed
dull
light
golden
with
a
hint
of
orange
hue
a
lacey
12
finger
white
head
atopthere
is
some
definant
funk
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
iron
and
lemon
pith
not
as
much
funk
as
i
envisioned
on
the
palate
yeah
there
is
a
bit
of
barnyard
there
but
it
is
just
part
of
the
package
i
pick
up
a
big
dose
of
citrus
and
toasty
malt
a
light
iron
note
as
wellwith
a
lingering
vinegar
type
flavor
i
like
it
maybe
a
little
more
conservative
than
many
of
the
style
i
dont
know
but
this
was
interesting
in
a
good
way
the
bottle
does
say
to
cellar
6
months
for
maximum
enjoyment
and
to
cellar
for
up
to
two
years
okay
okay
twist
my
arm
ill
get
another
bottle
and
try
it
again
that
said
at
12
a
bottle
its
not
going
to
become
a
regular
staple
in
my
household
anytime
soon
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
this
one
time
but
next
time
im
reaching
for
a
hennepin
or
a
rare
vos
theyre
far
more
economical
and
just
as
good
if
not
better
very
good
but
i
prefer
hennepin
to
this
d
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
not
an
everyday
beer
but
worth
enjoying
if
you
want
something
a
little
different
batch
1
june
2007
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
tart
with
some
funk
citrus
and
leather
the
taste
feautres
some
malt
with
spices
and
a
touch
more
of
the
funkiness
overall
this
brew
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
all
year
and
really
stands
out
as
one
of
the
finest
belgian
style
beers
this
side
of
the
pond
highly
recommended
chalky
dry
mouthfeel
plenty
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
tasty
not
armageddon
on
the
palate
as
the
label
would
imply
as
wild
ales
go
this
one
isnt
over
the
top
at
all
and
honestly
thats
what
i
like
about
it
it
actually
uses
all
you
typical
belgian
golden
or
triple
flavors
and
blends
it
well
with
the
wild
alenatural
lambic
type
tastes
it
has
huge
peaks
and
subtle
valleys
and
they
all
work
well
together
a
welcome
addition
to
the
ommegang
line
p
s
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
beer
for
people
that
dont
like
crafts
or
appreciate
belgian
style
id
call
it
an
intermediate
level
of
taste
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
fruity
flavors
to
the
malt
with
a
faint
hint
of
brett
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
after
a
few
years
to
see
if
the
brett
flavors
come
though
stronger
this
beer
has
nice
qualities
of
tripel
but
i
would
like
to
taste
this
with
more
wild
ale
flavors
very
nice
beer
from
ommegang
this
is
one
of
a
few
wild
american
beers
i
have
had
and
it
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
mouth
very
strong
carbonation
immediately
upon
entering
the
mouth
dry
and
chalky
slightly
tart
with
a
nickel
like
finish
grape
flavors
come
through
but
for
the
most
part
this
beer
is
super
dry
almost
champagne
like
in
taste
and
mf
except
for
the
metallic
finish
quite
hoppy
interesting
warmth
that
appears
long
after
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
is
tremendous
but
the
flavors
are
lacking
d
a
good
beer
from
ommegang
i
was
expecting
more
though
a
good
and
tasty
beer
just
not
at
the
excellence
that
i
find
in
ommegangs
other
beers
easy
to
drink
though
d
a
very
tasty
rendition
of
an
exotic
belgian
style
nothing
to
be
sought
after
but
a
good
beer
to
try
when
you
want
something
new
pours
a
peachy
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
reduces
fairly
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
behind
the
smell
was
a
little
bit
funkyskunky
as
advertised
with
some
spices
too
taste
was
peppery
with
a
tart
fruitiness
with
a
funky
almost
bitterness
that
hits
you
on
the
far
finish
after
its
already
gone
down
was
light
and
snappy
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
very
complex
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
not
one
that
ill
seek
out
all
the
time
for
enjoyment
but
certainly
one
you
want
to
sample
for
the
experience
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
head
that
has
great
retention
the
aroma
is
spicy
citrus
and
some
wheatbeer
characters
the
flavor
starts
out
as
a
slightly
spicy
and
smooth
belgian
with
some
citrus
thrown
in
but
it
finishes
with
a
very
smooth
and
mellow
brett
character
it
seems
that
they
threw
the
brett
yeast
into
the
secondary
so
the
sourness
only
comes
across
on
the
finish
the
body
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
great
ill
have
this
one
many
times
in
the
future
this
beer
is
definitely
not
retired
the
bottle
says
batch

june
2007
my
first
wild
ale
was
an
interesting
brew
not
super
funky
or
sour
actually
quite
accessible
im
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
this
is
good
ale
but
its
taste
is
not
really
that
of
a
session
beer
it
is
more
of
a
sipper
and
one
that
might
go
well
as
an
afterdinner
beer
also
this
is
listed
here
as
having
been
retired
but
it
seems
to
have
been
rereleased
at
least
temporarily
as
there
were
many
cases
of
it
at
the
store
where
i
bought
it
the
label
had
a
an
ominous
red
mushroom
cloud
on
it
but
thankfully
uncorking
this
750
ml
bomber
did
not
produce
a
bottle
bomb
gushing
over
my
table
instead
the
gentle
smooth
carbonation
opened
up
to
form
a
three
finger
tall
head
in
the
duvel
tulip
i
had
selected
for
this
review
the
beer
looked
mostly
clear
except
for
a
slight
yeast
haze
and
the
smell
was
spicy
and
floral
the
taste
indicated
that
ommengang
had
kept
the
brettanomyces
introduction
in
check
and
the
beer
was
tart
without
being
funky
the
tartness
was
accompanied
by
an
old
cheese
like
earthy
flavor
and
both
were
balanced
by
the
candi
sugar
pale
malt
and
herbal
and
floral
hops
not
quite
as
dry
or
spicy
as
the
true
handiworks
of
belgian
yeast
this
was
still
quite
a
bit
less
sweet
than
most
other
american
takes
on
the
style
very
light
and
airy
in
the
mouth
as
intended
i
suppose
a
great
rare
find
from
my
local
package
store
windward
beverage
mart
way
too
easy
to
drink
up
despite
the
8
abv
served
a
nice
hazy
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
rather
quickly
but
left
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
spice
with
a
bit
of
sweet
fruit
as
well
the
taste
was
nowhere
near
as
sour
as
russian
river
temptation
more
along
the
lines
of
a
yeasty
saison
the
beer
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
however
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
but
like
anything
of
the
style
its
a
little
pricey
d
i
wish
i
would
have
consumed
this
closer
to
the
6
month
recommendation
for
max
brett
funk
i
thought
it
was
good
but
a
little
light
on
the
funk
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
distinctive
as
the
label
and
pedigree
would
promise
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
getting
into
when
i
bought
this
for
12
99
i
was
expecting
a
few
more
flavors
to
creep
out
and
i
was
drinking
most
of
it
at
room
temperature
but
its
smooth
flavor
and
champagnelike
texture
were
invigorating
to
me
im
sure
you
can
still
find
a
few
bottles
of
this
sitting
around
somewhere
and
if
you
do
get
one
after
having
this
beer
on
tap
the
other
night
at
the
sunset
grill
and
tap
i
was
compelled
to
seek
out
a
bottle
label
says
it
is
batch
1
from
june
of
07
pours
a
golden
slightly
murky
color
with
a
small
heading
the
aroma
has
a
very
dry
champaign
sort
of
character
as
well
as
a
light
sour
smell
reminiscent
of
a
chardonnay
when
first
hitting
the
palate
it
has
a
very
carbonated
champaign
flavor
but
after
letting
it
explore
the
palate
a
bit
some
of
that
initial
sharpness
fades
away
to
tart
fruit
and
then
ends
on
a
dry
bitter
note
pretty
light
to
medium
in
body
i
cant
taste
any
of
the
8
abv
but
i
am
starting
to
feel
it
for
me
this
was
a
very
drinkable
ale
as
well
this
is
a
cool
beer
in
my
book
it
might
not
be
as
funky
or
out
there
as
some
of
the
cantillon
beers
employing
wild
yeast
strains
but
still
an
interesting
move
for
ommegang
saw
this
on
tap
and
had
to
give
it
a
shot
looks
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
smells
of
pine
spice
some
hops
citrus
cloves
tastes
tart
has
earth
tones
some
hops
very
floral
delicous
fruit
kind
of
reminds
me
of
fin
du
monde
feels
full
and
foamy
finishes
a
little
dry
tasty
brew
especially
on
tap
i
wont
seek
it
out
but
i
def
wont
turn
away
from
it
my
girlfriend
brought
me
this
beer
back
from
her
recent
trip
to
new
york
ommegeddon
pours
a
hazy
light
copper
with
a
thin
foamy
head
from
the
aroma
i
would
almost
guess
this
was
a
wit
it
has
a
slightly
sour
yeasty
smell
with
a
vague
hint
of
corriander
although
i
might
be
imagining
it
the
flavor
is
delicious
dry
and
refreshing
lots
of
light
malt
flavor
despite
the
dryness
hop
flavor
is
present
but
not
overdone
nice
and
balanced
there
is
some
funkiness
from
the
brett
the
finish
is
exceptional
full
bodied
despite
being
dry
and
refreshing
note
this
was
a
freshly
released
bottle

in

and
very
drinkable
hot
days
be
damned
d
this
tastes
in
all
honesty
like
a
hefeweizen
from
a
can
i
know
that
sounds
odd
but
by
the
time
i
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
other
off
flavors
thats
what
i
was
picking
up
and
its
not
crosscontamination
on
the
palate
or
anything
this
was
the
first
i
had
had
either
way
its
very
drinkable
but
not
for
11
99
a
bottle
definitely
something
everyone
should
try
once
though
on
tap
at
the
blue
nile
this
brew
arrived
in
a
westmalle
chalice
the
beer
is
a
hazy
pale
orangegolden
straw
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
receded
rather
slowly
living
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
yeasty
with
a
lot
of
pepper
and
a
fiant
yet
noticable
acidic
twang
the
taste
is
more
balance
than
the
aroma
it
seems
just
as
peppery
but
the
acidic
sourness
comes
through
a
little
more
giving
the
beer
more
strucure
and
character
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
i
was
hoping
this
beer
would
me
more
sour
than
it
is
however
i
still
enjoyed
it
and
will
again
if
given
the
opertunity
another
ommegang
delight
cheers
drinkability
a
wonderfully
tasty
beer
that
is
pretty
is
to
quaff
great
beer
i
wish
i
could
see
around
more
often
d
damn
good
an
awesome
saison
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
if
i
can
find
it
hard
to
characterize
some
aspects
of
a
saison
some
of
a
trippel
and
maybe
a
wild
wheat
enjoyable
but
not
something
i
would
rush
back
to
try
again
on
tap
last
night
at
ommegang
night
at
the
belgian
roomhop
devil
grill
nyc
poured
very
cloudy
apricot
with
a
finely
knit
tiny
bubble
head
and
leaving
stringy
tight
webs
of
lacing
nose
was
strongly
of
bubble
gum
cotton
candy
and
a
slight
barnyard
funkyness
this
a
freshly
fruity
brew
with
notes
of
melon
funky
yeasty
goodness
and
moderate
brett
sourness
in
the
mid
section
and
finish
biting
crisping
and
drying
hops
also
in
the
finish
wrap
this
one
up
my
kind
of
brew

belgiansaisonwittriple
lovers
go
get
some
of
this
asap
and
tell
ommegang
to
bottle
large
amounts
im
a
big
fan
of
ommegang
and
this
one
isnt
the
most
drinkable
of
their
brews
but
its
definitely
a
fun
one
to
try
if
you
have
a
chance
n
b
though
this
beer
is
categorized
as
retired
i
found
it
at
an
ommegang
event
in
new
york
on
august
23
2006
can
we
say
winner
ommegangs
new
farmhouse
wild
saison
is
a
sight
to
behold
slightly
cloudy
pale
golden
with
a
thick
cap
of
white
froth
topping
it
off
like
the
top
layer
of
a
dairy
queen
blizzard
head
retention
is
nice
as
well
aromas
are
all
funky
farmyard
brett
and
some
other
wheaty
yeasty
notes
as
well
hopping
is
light
and
just
serves
to
give
a
bitter
end
and
dryer
spirtzy
finish
taste
is
funky
as
hell
sweet
and
sour
almost
a
good
vs
evil
sort
of
story
with
the
brett
winning
control
slowly
but
surely
a
real
brett
bomb
this
one
is
mouthfeel
is
sharp
spritzy
and
dry
at
the
end
leading
to
a
wonderful
drinkability
possibly
the
most
summery
tasting
wildfarmhouse
ale
ive
tasted
as
of
yet
i
can
just
imagine
how
much
better
this
one
will
taste
outdoors
at
their
brewery
its
a
real
show
stopper
and
i
cant
wait
until
it
is
brewed
again
and
gets
some
wider
distribution
recently
tried
this
one
at
the
extreme
beer
fest
had
no
idea
ommegang
was
even
attempting
a
wild
beer
bright
yellow
color
like
a
suppedup
wit
brett
in
the
nose
on
first
taste
it
definetly
had
a
wheat
component
directly
followed
up
with
the
classic
sweaty
horse
that
brett
imparts
not
much
if
any
sourlactic
flavors
with
the
brett
playing
starring
role
in
the
wild
yeast
department
if
you
are
into
beers
feral
side
than
this
is
one
to
tryif
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
if
you
do
let
me
know
where
you
found
it
i
believe
the
guy
who
poured
it
for
me
said
it
was
around
8
abv
but
you
would
never
guess
when
you
were
drinking
it
if
i
had
to
put
some
label
as
to
category
it
would
fall
into
the
experimental
saison
i
wonder
if
this
is
anything
like
they
used
to
brew
for
farm
hands
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
corked
and
caged
750
ml
bottle
from
tipples
pours
deep
reddish
orange
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
off
white
head
aroma
is
muted
with
some
metallic
and
cardboard
notes
oak
some
light
sour
funk
sweet
fruit
and
a
vinous
presence
flavor
follows
as
a
beautiful
combination
of
sweet
fruit
red
wine
sour
lacto
dry
oak
wow
this
is
really
nice
no
sign
of
the
whiskey
here
but
i
am
ok
with
that
the
wine
barrel
and
sour
notes
really
take
over
medium
heavy
body
medium
plus
carbonation
really
nice
beer
overall
i
thought
love
child
no
3
was
a
fantasticly
interesting
and
complex
wild
ale
but
love
child
no
4
seemed
lacked
some
of
flavor
and
seemed
rather
onedimensional
first
sour
beer
ive
had
that
kicked
me
in
tha
back
of
the
throat
with
sour
that
was
an
interesting
experience
and
it
made
me
crave
more
great
sour
definitely
recommend
enjoy
pours
a
clear
amber
brown
with
hints
of
pink
bubbly
light
tan
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
into
a
medium
collar
pretty
good
lacing
and
decent
legs
aroma
is
tart
dark
cherry
cranberry
and
black
raspberry
behind
that
theres
some
earthy
woodiness
when
i
swirl
the
glass
the
vinous
woodiness
really
comes
alive
taste
follows
aroma
with
some
wine
barrel
resin
little
bit
of
funk
but
the
brett
is
majorly
covered
up
by
the
sour
lacto
at
this
point
in
the
aging
process
taste
is
also
extremely
tart
and
reminds
me
of
a
very
sour
jolly
rancher
very
fruity
but
quite
sour
medium
carbonation
and
body
absolutely
delish
the
brett
character
is
awesome
great
beer
the
pour
itself
gets
aromas
flowing
quickly
to
my
nose
and
getting
my
taste
buds
watering
pours
to
a
murky
honey
brown
tone
of
swamp
water
of
a
body
head
is
a
biscuity
golden
brown
that
fades
to
a
skim
quickly
no
lace
is
left
behind
nose
is
fruit
resin
sweetness
mixed
with
dusty
tartness
that
dances
well
together
wow
is
all
my
brain
can
get
out
as
i
take
first
sip
a
wonderfully
brutal
attack
of
sour
quickly
takes
over
the
tongue
astringent
and
full
sour
feel
swarms
the
mouth
with
each
sip
you
get
lemon
peel
and
high
quality
boutique
vinegar
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
dry
dusting
of
sour
candy
coating
this
is
a
truely
sour
beer
and
not
for
the
faint
at
heart
mouthfeel
is
a
real
pucker
up
great
taste
low
on
nose
nice
balance
overall
really
good
complex
wild
ale
well
worth
picking
up
but
wouldnt
recommend
to
someone
new
to
sours
as
this
one
is
pretty
intense
delicious
fruity
smells
great
i
love
this
brew
verdict
a
very
nice
american
wild
ale
from
boulevard
and
a
nice
interplay
between
the
wine
and
bourbon
barrels
both
getting
their
turn
to
shine
nicely
sour
but
not
cripplingly
so
and
the
cherry
and
fruit
profile
fits
in
well
with
the
barrel
treatments
this
beer
is
awesome
and
anyone
who
tells
you
otherwise
just
doesnt
like
wild
beers
tastelol
this
tastes
like
hot
rotten
watermelon
or
strawberry
wine
mixed
with
green
beer
and
aged
in
dog
dish
in
the
hot
summer
sun
dont
waste
your
money
it
was
more
carbonated
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
settled
down
as
it
sat
in
the
glass
great
color
orangebrown
it
was
tarter
than
i
was
expecting
to
me
it
tasted
better
the
colder
it
got
o
very
good
wild
ale
the
winebarrel
aging
adds
a
subtle
bit
of
complexity
i
cant
really
detect
much
that
the
whiskeybarrel
aging
adds
but
again
i
personally
wont
complain
about
that
pours
a
hazy
pinkorange
with
thin
fizzy
offwhite
colored
head
thin
ring
left
behind
with
a
few
dots
trailing
down
the
glass
smell
flanders
red
more
oaky
with
some
soft
melon
and
caramel
in
the
back
overlaid
with
cherry
overripe
stone
fruit
grapeskin
hints
of
acetic
brett
and
cued
whiskey
taste
raspberry
lime
tart
grapes
lactic
then
into
peach
skin
woody
and
herbal
apple
cider
vinegar
and
a
tiny
bit
of
goat
cheese
in
the
finish
and
a
residual
booze
feeling
left
on
the
lips
this
is
very
good
but
id
like
to
see
the
funk
meter
and
sour
meter
swap
values
another
superb
beer
in
the
series
pretty
great
every
year
this
was
no
exception
very
complex
nice
surprize
i
lost
my
taste
notes
awesome
sour
with
many
layers
to
it
fruity
brett
barrel
tart
just
great
a
really
pleasant
surprise
jealous
of
those
who
have
consistent
access
to
this
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
tart
fruit
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
good
sour
wild
ale
and
is
drinking
great
right
now
the
natural
procession
of
the
ale
lands
it
at
a
severely
dry
finish
decorated
with
fruit
skins
salt
brine
peppery
warmth
and
oakaged
vinegar
to
close
its
overall
sourness
is
irresistible
as
it
provokes
the
sweat
glands
and
tightens
the
cheeks
with
each
and
every
sip
note
batch
l140772
boulevard
hits
a
home
run
with
this
vastly
simple
yet
delicious
barrel
aged
sour
ale
the
nose
is
sour
and
somewhat
acidic
with
a
vinegar
like
aroma
but
it
keeps
a
natural
cherry
tone
the
flavor
is
simple
as
well
but
mixes
the
vanilla
of
the
barrel
and
tart
cherry
to
create
a
great
tasting
ale
there
are
tones
of
cocoa
butter
with
creaminess
and
a
move
towards
a
flemish
sour
as
you
continue
to
drink
not
too
tart
or
sour
this
is
easy
and
flavorful
deep
strawberry
in
body
with
whipped
cream
head
aroma
of
sour
notes
wine
cherries
booze
restrained
flavors
of
sour
apple
slices
warmth
of

light
in

with

a
great
face
puncher
shame
isnt
as
sophisticated
as
its
predecessor
overall
a
fantastic
beer
while
i
get
that
long
term
aging
is
expensive
i
still
find
it
difficult
to
shell
out
for
this
and
oude
tart
however
not
at
all
disappointed
top
shelf
stuff
number
4
is
by
far
the
best
one
of
these
that
i
have
had
i
didnt
even
love
the
other
ones
all
that
much
but
this
is
elite
level
beer
with
the
whiskey
being
way
more
prominent
than
i
recall
in
the
others
and
the
red
malt
sweetness
toned
down
along
with
the
almost
flemish
red
vinegar
side
of
the
sourness
love
the
lighter
body
and
the
big
bubbles
its
different
being
so
whiskey
forward
but
so
light
feeling
nothing
else
compared
it
also
has
a
real
strong
abv
but
drinks
like
its
5
so
unique
in
that
regard
too
i
pick
up
cherry
and
raspberry
fruitiness
in
nose
and
taste
but
also
a
real
heavy
lacto
thing
that
only
comes
from
wine
barrels
and
time
going
by
mature
as
they
get
although
i
would
still
like
to
cellar
a
bottle
or
two
we
all
admired
its
depth
its
grain
neutral
perspective
and
its
apparent
noncommittal
nature
as
far
as
direction
is
concerned
to
the
beat
of
its
own
drum
this
one
walks
and
i
dig
that
about
it
leagues
better
than
its
predecessors
i
want
more
it
is
like
a
sweetart
and
beer
had
a
baby
a
beautuful
beautiful
baby
b
thanks
tibi
tripped
on
the
acidity
at
first
wrapped
by
palate
around
it
mastered
my
high
really
enjoyed
drank
too
fast
i
think
im
having
a
stroke
from
all
the
stupid
in
the
air
but
the
beer
good
nothing
groundbreaking
or
nipplehardening
just
a
good
solid
wild
ale
a
solid
and
complex
sour
mostly
cherry
and
apricot
wine
flavor
minimal
bourbon
barrel
presence
when
i
think
of
a
great
sour
this
is
exactly
what
comes
to
mind
not
only
is
it
a
great
sour
beer
but
it
is
probably
the
best
tasting
beer
i
had
tried
up
to
this
point
i
love
the
blending
of
old
and
new
beers
the
complexities
that
brettanomyces
and
lactobacillus
add
to
the
flavor
and
of
course
the
subtle
smoothness
that
only
barrelaging
can
accomplish
i
just
dont
see
how
it
could
get
any
better
o
love
this
beer
havent
had
much
from
boulevard
but
this
is
impressive
could
definitely
go
for
more
love
children
a
very
solid
sour
nice
tart
flavors
with
some
real
depth
to
them
some
nice
citrusy
and
floral
aromas
and
a
nice
clean
pour
with
a
pure
white
head
no
real
funk
to
this
beer
just
clean
tart
flavors
with
some
nice
dimensionality
added
by
the
wood
very
nice
serving
type
bottle
d
highly
drinkable
at
9
aggressively
sour
and
subtly
sweet
after
tasting
this
i
went
to
the
store
to
purchase
another
bottle
for
a
year
or
so
down
the
road
absolutely
delicious
total
3750
i
am
giving
this
beer
a
higher
rating
than
i
would
based
off
of
my
friends
rating
who
loves
sours
i
personnally
dont
like
them
but
bought
this
based
off
of
the
label
not
knowing
it
was
a
sour
anyways
as
far
as
sours
go
it
is
well
done
it
is
def
sour
and
has
some
fruity
wine
notes
to
it
with
nice
head
retention
and
mouth
feel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
these
crazy
wild
ales
arent
necessarily
my
style
but
they
are
good
to
drink
from
time
to
time
to
break
completely
out
of
the
mold
it
is
certainly
unlike
anything
most
have
ever
drank
before
in
their
lives
condor
recommended
and
approved
overall
complex
at
first
but
becomes
very
strong
on
the
sour
apple
flavor
as
i
keep
drinking
it
o
goodness
this
ones
big
mouthblowing
and
not
for
the
faint
of
tongue
enjoyable
but
id
guess
acquired
for
most
tastes
sour
bitter
funky
beautiful
beer
highly
recommend
this
beer
is
lemonheavy
and
i
like
easy
drinking
and
abundant
in
flavor
4

excellent
beer
super
sour
banana
bread
on
the
nose
mouth
puckering
taste
and
finishes
like
a
war
head
o
very
enjoyable
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
when
it
comes
to
sourness
everyone
in
the
extended
family
enjoyed
this
one
some
more
than
others
prost
this
is
my
first
sour
ive
ever
tried
i
cant
really
describe
it
its
like
a
palate
overload
i
think
that
its
awesome
though
maybe
the
wine
barrel
aging
definitely
shines
through
more
than
the
whiskey
barrel
aging
reminds
me
of
champagne
drink
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
can
see
why
this
cracked
the
top
250
i
will
admit
i
am
a
bit
of
a
blvd
fan
boy
though
ooverall
an
incredible
beer
im
really
starting
to
enjoy
this
beer
style
especially
since
i
got
this
one
for
10
overall
4
5
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
series
thus
far
the
wine
foeder
aging
imparted
a
wonderful
dry
fruity
characteristic
that
really
separated
it
from
the
previous
iterations
as
delicious
as
they
were
if
this
is
how
boulevard
is
going
to
put
their
new
foeders
to
use
im
downright
giddy
to
see
what
else
they
come
out
with
in
the
future
o
huge
price
tag
on
this
one
and
ive
heard
lots
of
accolades
about
it
i
do
love
sours
and
it
is
one
of
my
favourite
styles
given
that
i
was
expecting
more
from
love
child
no
4
not
as
complex
as
many
other
sours
and
im
really
predominately
getting
sour
with
some
barrel
quality
it
could
have
so
much
more
depth
and
character
however
its
a
great
sour
sipper
will
give
it

out
of
10
got
it
in
asheville
and
drank
it
in
ontario
august
20th
2014
the
carbonation
and
sourness
keep
the
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
in
check
though
they
do
creep
up
a
bit
not
as
drinkable
as
the
flanders
reds
of
belgium
but
still
pretty
nice
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
ever
had
awesome
o
without
a
doubt
the
champagne
of
beers
the
artful
and
meticulous
construction
is
readily
apparent
and
the
flavors
are
delicious
in
spite
of
a
9
abv
ive
never
finished
750
ml
of
craft
beer
so
quickly
by
myself
im
definitely
biased
toward
beer
but
i
would
take
a
bottle
of
this
kansas
city
beer
over
dom
perignon
any
day
bearing
in
mind
ive
only
tried
the
96
expect
cherries
with
hints
of
honey
and
oak
delivered
with
the
cleanest
mouthfeel
this
style
has
to
offer
an
excellent
beer
to
share
with
friends
but
id
rather
keep
every
drop
for
myself
o
this
is
definitely
a
boulevard
belgianstyle
beer
the
great
color
perfect
level
of
carbonation
and
unique
boulevardness
im
not
amazed
with
the
flavors
but
respect
the
beer
on
its
merits
its
very
wellconstructed
and
i
believe
they
accomplished
what
they
are
trying
to
achieve
o
outstanding
complex
and
well
integrated
fantastic
sour
character
an
interesting
beer
tough
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
tried
to
share
with
my
wife
and
inlaws
who
all
hated
it
as
expected
they
said
it
would
make
a
great
salad
dressing
i
am
intrigued
by
this
d
this
was
a
fantastic
sour
with
great
complexity
to
the
scent
and
taste
wine
and
bourbon
barrels
mixed
perfectly
the
body
was
fitting
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
for
a
wild
but
it
should
be
sipped
and
savored
could
age
well
im
sure
but
doesnt
need
it
top
quality
brew
a
real
mother
pucker
here
o
a
wow
factor
from
the
first
sip
but
a
little
too
sour
after
half
way
through
the
glass
would
like
a
little
bit
more
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
sour
overall
very
enjoyable
o
its
nice
and
complex
but
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
bourbon
still
great
though
if
you
love
sours
this
is
perfectly
refreshing
great
and
light
was
recommended
locally
here
but
heard
its
hard
to
find
highly
recommend
if
you
are
a
sour
lover
i
am
not
a
wine
fan
and
tend
to
stay
away
from
brews
aged
in
wine
barrels
but
it
was
not
winey
at
all
o
i
think
this
is
very
enjoyable
for
the
style
it
doesnt
try
to
squash
the
sour
which
is
nice
but
it
doesnt
let
it
go
wild
either
maybe
i
am
trying
to
say
its
a
wellbalanced
wild
ale
cloudy
red
amber
pour
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
very
sour
and
tart
aroma
intensely
sour
and
tart
taste
upfront
of
dark
fruitscherries
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
can
taste
the
oak
as
the
beer
warms
finishes
very
tart
and
juicy
the
depth
of
flavor
was
unbelievable
a
lot
of
things
were
happening
and
all
of
them
were
good
i
want
to
keep
two
or
three
of
these
in
the
closet
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
happens
id
imagine
this
will
age
very
well
amber
to
slightly
reddish
hued
with
a
fair
amount
of
cloudiness
just
a
trace
of
beige
foam
covers
about
a
third
of
the
top
aroma
of
very
tart
cherries
and
horse
blanket
the
taste
is
extremely
mouth
puckering
tartness
initially
its
highly
acidic
and
tart
cherries
the
mouth
is
highly
carbonated
and
highly
acidic
highly
refreshing
and
yet
a
beer
that
you
have
to
be
ready
for
an
overpowering
burst
of
tartness
the
intense
sour
and
acidic
bite
crosses
that
line
and
makes
it
a
bit
harsh
for
me
the
smokestack
series
is
always
one
of
my
favorites
around
and
i
always
try
to
pick
up
the
new
love
child
when
it
comes
out
though
they
are
never
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
or
series
the
beer
pours
a
very
bubbly
off
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
grapefruit
red
with
some
light
brown
notes
the
beer
smell
has
strong
sour
acidic
funk
notes
the
funk
is
pretty
strong
and
dominates
most
of
the
notes
but
some
other
notes
consist
of
oak
and
light
fruit
with
cinnamon
the
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
the
taste
is
very
interesting
the
beer
starts
off
with
the
strong
acidic
taste
but
transitions
to
a
much
sweeter
and
sugary
taste
the
taste
has
the
same
cinnamon
notes
and
fruit
notes
that
accompany
that
acidic
taste
the
oak
is
not
as
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
does
have
a
slight
presence
as
well
as
a
hint
of
whiskey
additionally
the
fruitiness
from
the
red
wine
barrel
also
comes
out
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
one
of
the
better
and
lighter
wild
ales
that
ive
had
this
is
delicious
harmony
throughout
the
bottle
and
the
glass
with
all
the
elements
playing
off
each
other
also
this
beer
is
9
abv
its
dangerously
well
hidden
the
overall
since
love
child
2
i
was
hooked
my
mouth
would
love
me
and
my
wallet
would
cry
for
i
now
was
a
sours
kind
of
person
a
friend
had
a
beer
tasting
most
of
them
were
turned
of
but
i
could
get
enough
i
had
strong
hype
on
love
child
no
4
and
it
did
not
disappoint
if
you
like
sours
this
is
a
must
try
i
recommend
one
or
two
since
there
not
cheap
i
am
grateful
for
nabbing
one
but
i
do
believe
i
will
try
and
get
one
to
age
some
750
ml
bottle
pours
orange
with
tall
longlasting
foamy
white
head
and
nice
lacing
nose
is
of
caramel
malt
funky
yeast
ripe
fruit
and
spices
body
is
full
and
very
tangy
taste
is
very
sour
funky
tart
fruity
finish
is
long
and
sour
there
should
be
a
note
on
the
label
to
put
syrup
in
only
a
parent
can
love
the
love
child
4
you
must
like
sour
beers
to
enjoy
this
one
for
me
not
so
much
probably
my
least
favorite
from
boulevard
the
beer
pour
a
cloudy
amber
with
not
head
and
no
lace
the
scent
had
bourbon
and
sour
mash
the
taste
was
very
potent
and
tart
similar
to
lemonhead
candy
there
were
hints
of
bourbon
and
white
wine
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
little
carbonation
overall
not
a
beer
for
me
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
thats
about
it
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
although
the
initial
funk
is
slightly
offputting
it
definitely
grows
on
you
and
you
keep
going
back
for
that
next
sip
absolutely
worth
the
16
99
overall
a
very
nice
sour
oanother
solid
love
child
sour
if
only
these
things
werent
so
damn
expensive
but
worth
the
try
o
while
not
much
to
look
at
the
great
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
basically
a
sweet
and
sour
awa
with
better
than
most
barrel
notes
thats
what
really
sets
it
apart
for
me
the
barrel
treatment
imagine
la
folie
or
supplication
but
with
a

really
blessed
by
a
friend
who
brought
this
to
share
a
really
fun
experience
for
me
and
it
has
finally
opened
my
eyes
to
the
world
of
sours
i
am
totally
intrigued
by
this
style
now
and
not
quite
as
intimidated
this
beer
had
great
aromas
and
flavors
throughout
overall
very
refreshing
an
absolutely
delicious
sour
i
hope
there
is
more
left
at
the
store
overall
its
not
bad
but
the
beer
lack
a
lot
of
malt
depth
but
perhaps
thats
its
angle
does
come
off
like
a
good
solid
wild
beer
though
poured
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
june
2014
purchased
from
whole
foods
in
north
austin
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
different
complexity
with
this
one
i
was
hopeful
with
the
different
barrels
and
all
it
would
maybe
stray
away
from
just
straight
sour
but
i
was
wrong
lots
of
good
character
but
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
hundreds
of
other
wine
barrel
sours
i
thought
about
going
back
to
cellar
another
bottle
but
at
the
price
i
will
pass
this
is
one
of
the
best
sours
american
wild
ales
i
have
had
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
perfect
very
smooth
sour
you
dont
even
notice
the
9
abv
the
price
for
the
750
ml
bottle
os
quite
high
between
16
99
to
19
99
is
quite
high
that
being
said
if
you
like
sour
beers
you
should
try
this
at
least
once
best
boulevard
beer
ive
had
another
awesome
take
on
lc
definitely
boulevards
finest
work
recommend
even
18750
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
stock
up
i
wonder
how
this
would
drink
in
5
years
a
beautiful
sour
buy
this
beer
again
and
again
and
share
it
with
everyone
you
love
very
good
sour
not
sure
i
like
this
as
much
as
3
or
2
but
still
worthy
of
you
beer
if
you
likeem
sour
overall
a
lot
going
on
in
this
fourth
edition
of
love
child
really
enjoying
the
interplay
between
the
wine
and
bourbon
barrels
19
for
750
ml
just
getting
into
sours
so
i
dont
have
much
to
go
by
but
i
thought
this
was
pretty
impressive
the
alcohol
was
very
hidden
maybe
just
a
small
burn
as
you
swallow
very
lemony
with
some
berry
notes
as
well
i
couldnt
taste
the
bourbon
too
much
but
i
could
definitely
get
some
of
the
wine
barrel
it
was
aged
in
overall
i
think
this
was
very
tasty
and
im
glad
i
picked
up
3
bottles
since
it
is
very
reasonably
priced
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
complex
wild
ale
too
bad
i
never
was
able
to
try
the
earlier
iterations
of
love
child
but
i
will
certainly
keep
an
eye
out
for
future
ones
this
beer
smells
like
victory
and
it
tastes
great
too
first
taste
to
swallow
and
finish
great
brew
overall
theres
not
really
enough
going
on
with
this
brew
to
make
it
my
favorite
yet
the
aroma
makes
this
one
to
seek
out
i
will
not
buy
this
again
for
the
flavor
isnt
really
impacting
me
enough
to
seek
it
out
not
bad
not
great
yet
its
dead
in
the
flavor
for
me
dark
with
minimal
head
that
quickly
fades
smells
like
earth
tart
berries
and
a
tiny
bit
of
funk
tastes
of
subtle
blackberries
peach
and
bandaid
funk
very
drinkable
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
not
the
best
small
bottle
from
allagash
but
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
by
allagash
very
different
and
interesting
i
cant
say
that
i
would
call
this
a
soured
stout
but
it
is
defiantely
a
dark
beer
with
brett
perhaps
it
could
be
considered
a
combination
of
a
black
saison
a
wild
ale
and
a
mellow
porter
as
always
allagash
delivers
an
awesome
looking
beer
with
nice
complexity
from
the
flavor
profile
and
a
great
mouthfeel
to
boot
should
i
just
move
to
portland
maine
to
be
closer
to
the
source
of
so
many
great
wild
ales
bottled
june

2014
poured
from
a
cork
and
cage
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
an
extremely
dark
almost
opaque
brown
coloring
that
borders
on
date
colored
the
beer
pours
with
a
dense
foamy
bubbly
head
that
quickly
recedes
into
a
surface
coating
of
offwhite
aromas
of
farmhouse
funk
date
and
red
grape
sweetness
solid
roasted
character
licorice
cotton
candy
and
some
earthy
notes
flavors
are
roasted
and
sweet
forward
with
notes
of
date
and
fig
licorice
tobacco
brown
sugar
red
wine
dry
and
sweet
and
tart
berry
there
is
a
sharp
and
very
tartsour
undertone
with
hints
of
citrus
mint
and
an
herbal
blend
of
spices
cherry
subtle
yeast
funk
and
earth
round
out
the
tail
end
of
the
palate
with
the
tart
and
sour
notes
carrying
through
into
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
robust
and
dry
giving
a
solid
and
consistent
feeling
across
the
palate
very
subdued
roasted
sweet
and
tart
aftertaste
compared
to
the
palate
but
a
perfect
transition
into
the
smooth
dry
and
soft
finish
with
only
subtle
lingers
of
old
world
fruit
and
berries
very
solid
balanced
layered
beer
cheers
sweet
yet
not
overly
so
brett
has
added
a
lot
of
nuanced
fruit
flavors
to
this
beer
the
balance
of
dryness
helps
lend
this
beer
its
high
score
b
if
you
dont
like
brettanomyces
you
wont
like
this
one
its
on
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
the
dark
color
gives
the
beer
its
name
and
is
quite
different
than
standard
belgian
ales
light
on
the
tongue
the
bite
of
the
yeast
is
quite
prevalent
there
is
an
underlying
malty
richness
to
the
beer
overall
it
is
like
nothing
else
ive
had
and
immensely
enjoyable
this
beer
starts
out
far
more
dark
than
the
smell
indicatesa
bit
of
molasses
and
toasted
bread
the
flavors
than
shift
to
the
smell
with
a
definitive
sourness
like
blackberries
lots
of
carbonation
but
relatively
rich
as
well
very
different
chalky
grape
candy
aroma
mellow
for
a
sour
but
has
a
cough
syrup
aftertaste
still
interesting
overall
this
beer
has
got
better
with
age
brett
is
more
bearable
and
this
beer
was
finished
before
i
knew
it
the
beer
itself
is
a
bit
of
coffee
very
light
and
some
roasted
malts
nothing
too
overpowering
this
then
fades
a
bit
and
there
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
also
just
a
hint
of
some
brett
on
the
aftertaste
the
brett
here
seems
to
be
really
only
in
the
nose
pretty
much
a
somewhat
bland
fairly
light
tasting
stout
otherwise
probably
the
worst
of
the
allagash
limited
releases
that
i
have
tried
so
far
very
enjoyable
with
belgain
friets
and
worth
finding
again
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
was
a
complete
wow
beer
considering
what
it
was
a
little
under
a
year
ago
i
wish
i
grabbed
a
few
more
bottles
damn
what
a
year
in
a
bottle
can
do
with
brett
medium
bodied
full
carbonation
this
is
a
keeper
get
it
if
you
can
the
first
dark
sour
ive
really
liked
maybe
ill
actually
like
sour
stouts
someday
overall
a
very
interesting
wild
ale
the
smell
geared
me
up
for
a
nice
slightly
sour
bready
sour
but
when
i
tasted
it
i
was
surprised
with
mild
dark
fruits
some
cocoa
and
very
little
sour
still
a
solid
drinkable
well
balanced
brew

the
beer
pours
a
dark
maroon
with
brown
sugar
highlights
it
forms
a
small
head
of
fizzing
lightly
yellowed
tan
bubbles
with
mild
retention
in
body
the
beer
is
a
dark
opaque
murk
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
bristling
tannic
oak
with
raisin
and
dark
cherry
accents
and
a
hint
of
plums
and
chocolate
subtle
brown
sugar
softens
the
edges
of
the
nose
as
well
the
beer
unfurls
more
and
more
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
and
is
full
of
quite
a
few
layers
of
complexity
on
the
tongue
the
beer
begins
as
tart
nearly
sour
with
fruity
accents
that
unfurl
and
then
are
coated
in
thick
roasted
malt
bitters
the
finish
is
lightly
dry
and
bitter
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
tart
dark
cherry
pie
coated
in
dark
sugar
with
hints
of
plum
these
flavors
unfurl
into
dark
caramelly
bread
with
roasted
coffee
and
burnt
toast
character
slight
bitter
herbal
hops
and
oak
tannin
enter
on
the
finish
to
give
structure
and
further
complexity
to
the
sip
the
aftertaste
is
of
bitter
roast
and
cherries
as
the
beer
warms
the
tart
cherry
flavors
begin
to
blend
in
with
the
middle
and
finish
of
the
sip
which
is
lovely
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
strong
carbonation
that
scrubs
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
luxurious
and
smooth
with
a
crisp
bite
from
the
carbonation
after
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
but
with
plenty
of
saliva
on
the
edges
of
the
tongue
and
a
slightly
bitter
stick
to
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
lovely
dark
sour
with
phenomenal
funk
and
roast
if
i
had
to
label
it
i
would
say
more
sour
brown
porter
than
sour
stout
but
honestly
this
beer
defies
modern
categories
its
a
new
style
that
needs
to
be
further
explored
this
is
a
lovely
sipper
that
could
pair
superbly
with
darker
meats
or
chocolate
raspberry
desserts
this
is
a
beer
to
try
o
this
is
a
bit
of
a
weird
one
for
me
was
not
expecting
this
dried
meat
aroma
and
smell
to
the
beer
overall
might
benefit
from
time
but
its
a
strange
beer
considering
allagash
made
this
o
interesting
a
bit
different
but
just
ok
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
allagash
offerings
i
guess
they
all
cant
be
winners
but
they
have
a
pretty
good
track
record
with
me
this
one
is
fine
but
i
wont
run
out
to
grab
the
stragglers
left
on
the
shelves
either
roasted
and
mildly
bretty
soft
and
mild
for
allagash
the
oak
would
have
helped
this
has
some
decent
brett
funk
with
a
nice
base
of
chocolate
and
caramel
i
dont
think
that
the
flavors
really
merge
as
well
as
they
could
but
this
is
definitely
good
i
have
another
bottle
aging
and
im
curious
what
will
happen
in
a
few
years
drinkability
really
enjoyed
the
sour
cherry
and
dark
chocolate
combination
glad
i
was
able
to
find
this
on
draft
i
would
certainly
pick
this
up
again
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
from
a
brewery
that
i
like
overall
i
think
this
thing
would
taste
much
better
fresh
the
funk
from
the
bret
made
this
beer
taste
dry
to
me
for
some
reason
it
seemed
to
have
over
powered
the
fruit
presence
i
probably
shouldnt
have
let
this
age
for
so
long
also
dont
understand
the
high
price
for
this
beer
i
give
it
a
b
overall
o
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
a
fantome
saison
in
terms
of
the
yeast
profile
and
off
flavors
i
give
it
extra
points
for
being
interesting
but
in
the
end
its
not
my
favorite
and
not
a
great
value
good
brett
character
without
being
overly
funky
or
unbalanced
the
dark
malts
provide
nice
flavors
but
overall
the
beer
is
fairly
relaxed
and
just
smooth
overall
this
is
a
quite
a
funky
beer
really
havent
tasted
dark
malts
and
brett
in
the
same
beer
like
this
but
it
works
pretty
well
but
is
sorta
weird
the
slight
cherry
taste
is
really
nice
and
even
better
in
the
nose
really
glad
a
generous
trader
let
me
get
a
taste
of
this
as
it
is
really
unique
a
nice
brew
and
change
of
pace
but
still
not
really
thrilled
by
the
dark
brettsour
beers
a
bit
contradictory
compilation
of
flavors
in
the
style
but
this
one
has
some
interesting
elements
and
is
very
drinkable
a
beautifully
packaged
wild
ale
from
allagash
dark
and
earthy
like
a
good
robust
porter
smelling
more
like
a
sour
lemony
and
slightly
lactic
but
coming
through
in
taste
with
the
soiled
malty
roast
first
and
an
extremely
dry
bretty
finish
that
really
exemplifies
the
use
of
brett
in
a
beer
its
wonderful
the
oak
profile
on
this
is
solid
too
a
little
sweet
for
a
second
but
really
just
mellowing
the
whole
thing
the
grain
first
yeast
second
trajectory
is
welcomed
too
with
a
soft
yet
rich
body
like
a
porter
or
a
dark
ale
not
bitter
but
lots
of
dark
barley
flavor
carbonation
is
comprised
of
so
many
tiny
bubbles
it
almost
seems
creamy
like
the
frothed
milk
on
the
top
of
a
proper
cappuccino
while
the
nose
shows
a
hint
of
souring
bugs
the
flavor
doesnt
at
all
just
the
brett
which
does
an
incredible
job
of
drying
things
out
and
adding
a
cool
flavor
layer
without
detracting
from
the
dusty
chalky
dry
chocolate
malt
flavors
while
i
can
easily
see
the
flavors
in
this
beer
being
polarizing
i
mean
its
rather
unconventional
one
must
admit
admire
and
appreciate
the
quality
of
this
brew
it
is
simply
wonderful
a
real
treat
to
get
to
try
this
stuff
out
here
in
denver
d
extremely
interesting
brew
that
is
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
taste
and
appereance
were
pleasent
with
aroma
coming
in
at
second
and
the
mouthfeel
leaving
some
to
desire
not
sure
if
to
state
that
this
was
a
great
brew
slowly
working
its
way
to
the
top
or
simply
a
great
brewery
with
a
brew
leaving
something
to
desire
pours
brown
within
white
head
and
nice
lace
left
behind
the
nose
starts
with
strong
brett
character
which
brings
funk
lemon
and
spice
to
the
nose
this
is
followed
up
with
some
roasted
notes
and
mild
chocolate
character
the
brett
notes
seem
to
work
nicely
with
the
roasted
malts
the
taste
features
notes
of
brett
fruit
funk
and
chocolate
intertwined
there
is
a
slight
tartness
at
the
beginning
but
that
is
overshadowed
by
roasty
malt
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
overall
i
like
the
combo
of
dark
malt
and
brett
i
think
the
two
strong
flavors
do
a
nice
job
of
balancing
each
other
theres
nothing
big
about
this
beer
but
i
think
thats
the
point
its
an
extremely
drinkable
very
mildlysour
dark
ale
the
brett
while
a
characteristic
of
the
beer
is
not
the
highlight
as
the
name
suggests
i
could
drink
several
of
these
but
wouldve
appreciated
a
bit
more
something
in
between
the
surprisingly
subtle
sourness
that
first
hits
your
tongue
and
the
roasty
fruity
finish
the
middle
just
seems
to
sit
there
coating
my
tongue
o
a
nice
example
of
a
brett
beer
and
perhaps
one
of
the
only
examples
of
a
dark
brett
beer
its
refreshing
since
its
not
a
dense
beer
like
a
stout
the
color
is
just
that
color
it
happens
to
be
dark
but
roast
is
negligent
minus
a
slight
ashy
character
but
is
typical
for
non
roasty
dark
beers
worth
a
try
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
an
everlasting
beige
head
that
leaves
copious
lacing
behind
the
aroma
brings
smoke
malt
molasses
leather
dark
fruit
funk
oak
well
balanced
and
flavorful
dark
saison
character
complex
and
intriguing
a
fun
beer
this
was
really
solid
id
definitely
have
this
again
overall
brett
is
a
bit
subdued
but
overall
a
nice
beer
probably
not
worth
the
price
tag
but
still
enjoyable
prost
o
a
tasty
beer
reserved
on
the
brett
and
well
balanced
with
malts
and
hops
the
brett
comes
through
more
as
it
warms
but
it
is
never
in
your
face
feel
medium
and
nice
rolling
carb
but
couldnt
save
it
o
lots
of
intangibles
in
this
special
beer
very
well
down
great
brett
beer
glad
i
have
5
more
o
terrible
experience
overall
i
had
to
use
a
sam
adams
rebel
ipa
as
a
chaser
to
finish
this
to
sum
it
up
this
tastes
like
a
smarties
factory
caught
on
fire
while
the
brewery
next
door
was
coolshipping
a
beer
o
just
a
weird
beer
not
my
style
at
all
o
this
is
a
grower
not
a
first
hit
sip
gets
better
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
i
wouldnt
recommend
refridgerating
this
one
very
complex
but
very
well
balanced
and
not
overbearing
in
any
part
of
its
flavor
components
very
different
wild
than
others
i
have
tried
kind
of
expensive
but
worth
a
try
o
interesting
sour
sour
berries
and
some
roasted
malt
its
borderline
like
a
light
sour
stout
but
more
grainy
than
youd
expect
from
a
sour
stout
hard
to
define
doesnt
really
conform
to
any
standard
or
have
any
comparisons
that
i
can
make
easily
o
this
beer
has
some
good
things
going
for
it
but
the
one
thing
that
really
detracts
from
this
beer
i
believe
is
how
damn
successful
allagash
is
at
creating
american
wild
ale
stacked
up
against
there
other
offerings
this
one
falls
a
little
short
however
i
still
think
this
beer
exhibits
something
that
other
breweries
have
yet
to
master
nuance
and
balance
allagash
have
mastered
nuance
and
balance
in
there
wild
ales
and
while
this
is
not
there
best
effort
it
is
better
than
many
wild
ales
ive
had
because
of
the
balance
and
nuance
i
think
this
beer
is
rated
unfairly
low
because
there
is
a
preconceived
notion
of
what
an
american
wild
ale
should
taste
like
or
maybe
im
just
an
allagash
fan
boy
m
medium
bodied
you
would
assume
leading
to
full
with
color
onothing
very
compelling
here
i
enjoy
dark
sours
but
this
really
did
bring
much
to
the
table
and
was
far
from
beers
like
tart
of
darkness
bottled
101613
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
dark
sours
but
this
is
surprisingly
enjoyable
the
slight
brett
presence
works
well
with
the
sweet
and
roasty
flavors
present
in
the
base
worth
a
try
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
decent
head
and
lace
and
an
aroma
of
chocolate
sour
and
tart
fruit
like
berries
although
there
is
a
mild
fruit
sweetness
as
well
in
the
aroma
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
at
times
got
chewey
andor
sticky
has
this
sour
funky
brett
aspect
also
a
little
spicy
that
is
combined
quite
well
i
must
say
with
some
chocolateyvanilla
overtones
and
this
touch
of
sweet
fruit
that
again
i
can
only
think
of
berries
more
straw
or
blue
than
rasp
or
black
for
a
really
good
beer
that
is
worth
having
again
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
topped
by
an
extremely
fluffy
three
finger
cream
colored
head
exceptional
retention
with
tons
of
lacing
whiffs
of
dark
cherries
accents
of
dark
chocolate
balsamic
vinegar
and
mixed
berries
on
the
nose
opens
with
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
joined
by
dark
cherries
blueberries
and
other
dark
fruit
notes
finishes
fairly
dry
with
tart
cherries
a
bit
of
balsamic
vinegar
light
oak
and
mild
rye
spice
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
silky
smooth
and
creamy
really
wonderful
unique
brew
thoroughly
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
its
alternately
sweet
and
sour
a
beer
to
savor
o
tasty
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
this
tastes
more
like
a
black
saison
than
a
wild
ale
not
very
sour
i
think
i
will
pick
up
another
bottle
to
let
it
age
and
see
if
it
gets
more
sour
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
kinda
expensive
but
i
bet
it
will
age
well
overall
decent
beer
that
has
some
very
tasty
moments
the
flavors
tend
to
clash
a
little
bit
though
bottle
from
fishpaws
while
visiting
family
in
md
corked
and
caged
pours
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
khaki
colored
one
finger
plus
head
aroma
is
big
funky
vinegar
and
wet
dog
black
cherry
tart
apricots
the
flavor
is
tart
up
front
with
black
cherry
but
then
fades
into
an
interesting
taste
of
roasted
malt
and
dry
ryestill
lightly
funky
and
sweetthen
back
into
fruity
black
cherries
that
linger
a
bit
relatively
light
bodied
and
perhaps
a
bit
more
watered
down
than
one
would
like
medium
carbonation
a
unique
beer
worth
trying
but
not
sure
it
is
worth
stocking
up
on
maybe
the
tartness
will
come
out
more
with
some
age
this
is
an
impressively
complex
and
tasty
wild
ale
if
anything
i
expected
more
tartness
especially
from
the
aroma
this
is
really
a
wonderful
beer
and
i
wish
there
were
more
of
it
to
go
around
verdict
an
ambitious
brew
and
one
that
started
out
great
the
aroma
is
great
and
really
emphasizes
the
fruit
that
brett
can
bring
out
but
the
beer
itself
is
just
a
little
too
heavy
and
malty
on
the
tongue
i
appreciate
the
gusto
it
takes
to
brew
a
beer
like
this
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
next
allagash
coolship
release
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
creamy
and
vigorous
light
tan
head
that
does
not
dissipate
quickly
and
appears
to
last
quite
a
while
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
black
with
hints
of
dark
ruby
red
that
adds
a
nice
shade
to
the
black
the
smell
is
very
good
and
certainly
worth
writing
about
the
beer
has
a
strong
funk
tart
smell
from
the
brett
in
addition
to
hops
a
bit
of
the
roast
all
of
which
to
form
a
cherry
smell
when
it
warms
up
some
of
the
raw
wheat
gets
through
and
combines
well
with
the
brett
but
easily
gets
lost
if
you
are
not
looking
for
the
wheat
the
roasted
character
also
comes
out
a
bit
to
make
the
combined
smell
similar
to
berry
the
hops
do
not
seem
to
be
very
present
if
at
all
the
taste
is
a
bit
different
from
the
smell
but
still
similar
in
some
respects
the
funk
is
still
the
strongest
flavor
but
is
less
sharp
than
it
is
in
the
smell
rather
the
funk
tartness
seems
to
mix
with
the
other
flavors
and
comes
out
a
similar
flavor
to
cherries
the
light
roast
also
makes
an
appearance
and
the
hops
are
make
an
appearance
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
feels
bubbly
and
smooth
but
not
crisp
which
makes
it
an
easy
but
unique
drink
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
get
again
if
i
can
swallow
the
price
tag
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
decent
sized
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
moderate
level
of
earthy
brett
aroma
along
with
hints
of
caramel
cherry
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
a
bit
tame
on
the
sourwild
front
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
bubbly
mouthfeel
decent
brew
but
feels
like
its
not
quite
done
yet
i
know
100
brett
beers
dont
get
horribly
tart
and
or
funky
but
for
me
this
one
was
just
meh
odisappointing
the
sour
tartness
just
isnt
strong
enough
then
again
not
all
american
wild
ales
are
necessarily
sours
but
for
those
looking
for
a
sour
ale
will
sorely
be
disappointed
so
check
your
expectations
taste
has
a
mellow
tartness
to
it
dark
woody
malt
dry
lingering
mst
aftertaste
of
musty
brett
yeast
medium
bodied
fairly
drinkable
overall
it
was
nice
to
try
but
not
something
id
revisit
personally
o
a
very
nice
and
interesting
awa
while
the
nose
suggests
a
bit
more
funk
and
sour
notes
the
taste
is
very
subdued
in
those
areas
nice
to
sip
on
and
let
the
complexities
of
the
brett
come
out
as
it
warms
the
roast
also
makes
it
quite
interesting
certainly
worth
trying
o
this
was
a
fantastic
drink
full
of
flavors
and
feels
that
will
satisfy
most
bas
part
wild
ale
dark
ale
and
pale
ale
with
a
great
malt
bill
including
rye
wheat
and
barley
and
an
assembly
of
complementary
hops
i
dont
know
what
wild
ale
fans
expect
but
i
thought
this
a
beer
particularly
worthy
of
even
nonwild
ale
fans
attention
as
it
was
imo
a
styletranscendent
beer
probably
be
too
limited
to
get
out
there
to
everyone
so
dont
pass
up
on
a
bottle
if
you
see
it
o
you
wouldnt
expect
this
to
be
a
wild
ale
from
its
appearance
but
it
has
a
nice
amount
of
sourness
thats
not
overpowering
and
interesting
contrasting
flavors
of
dark
malts
man
i
had
this
on
draft
at
an
allagash
event
last
year
and
remember
liking
it
quite
a
bit
i
decided
to
try
a
bottle
since
the
price
was
dropped
to
6
99
and
it
just
wasnt
the
same
it
had
a
roasty
bitter
character
that
was
sort
up
unpleasant
the
tartness
was
minimal
and
the
beer
just
didnt
seem
as
lively
as
it
was
fresh
i
just
dont
feel
like
the
roasty
bitterness
from
the
malts
and
slight
tang
from
the
brett
worked
very
well
together
it
isnt
terrible
bu
this
is
the
only
miss
ive
had
from
allagashs
corked
and
caged
wild
series
very
dark
brown
with
a
softlooking
beige
head
smells
different
than
i
expected
brett
tart
juicy
berries
grapes
and
leather
no
roasted
malt
character
to
speak
of
flavors
are
similar
with
brett
more
dark
fruits
like
blackberries
grapes
and
plums
and
some
very
light
phenolics
in
the
back
fluffy
tart
medium
body
drinks
lighter
than
its
strength
another
tasty
beverage
from
allagash
o
overall
i
was
again
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
the
brett
here
kind
of
overpowers
the
fruit
and
belgianesc
aspects
sigh
overall
tremendous
subtlety
in
every
direction
makes
this
beer
stand
out
the
barrel
aging
here
was
handled
with
great
deftness
overall
this
is
some
great
stuff
100
recommend
thanks
to
joefuzz
for
the
tip
on
this
one
decided
to
head
over
to
the
tap
room
for
lunch
to
see
what
the
hub
bub
was
all
about
showed
in
a
snifter
maroon
purple
with
minimal
head
smell
is
grape
and
dark
fruit
nice
sweetness
really
smooth
easy
drinker
not
really
all
that
sour
but
good
tartness
on
the
finish
word
is
this
might
go
to
bottles
paint
me
excited
great
sour
for
those
who
dont
love
overly
sour
beer
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
time
does
to
it
if
it
does
get
bottled
pours
just
like
the
name
midnight
black
with
a
tiny
ring
of
bubbles
smells
like
tart
grapes
with
a
little
bit
of
plums
taste
is
not
as
sour
as
the
nose
lets
on
more
funky
with
a
slight
sour
grape
twing
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
soft
carbonation
overall
this
beer
blew
me
away
i
hope
more
of
this
makes
it
into
my
market
overall
while
one
was
plenty
it
was
interesting
and
pleasant
real
neat
fun
beer
like
this
sweet
light
fruit
and
brett
mix
i
typically
dont
like
dark
sour
ales
but
this
has
really
made
me
think
otherwise
quite
a
good
beer
its
drinkable
yet
complex
it
reminds
me
of
dannon
mixed
berry
yogurt
that
is
how
much
of
a
fruit
profile
this
beer
has
this
one
surprised
me
good
one
o
overall
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
though
not
as
much
as
golden
brett
light
fruity
pebbles
in
the
nose
especially
but
a
good
mix
of
brett
sour
fruits
and
roasted
notes
well
worth
checking
out
had
during
brewvival
2013
served
from
tap
into
a
brewvival
sampler
shaker
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
minimal
tan
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
wood
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
big
funk
dark
fruit
wood
earth
and
subtle
dark
chocolate
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
i
will
come
out
and
say
it
right
out
of
the
gate
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
souredfunked
stouts
etc
however
i
do
mind
giving
them
a
try
this
one
was
one
im
glad
that
i
gave
a
shot
the
funk
on
this
one
was
definitely
the
dominate
factor
going
on
here
with
some
of
the
notes
from
the
base
brew
taking
a
backseat
the
brett
didnt
really
add
any
balance
to
the
brew
which
is
what
hurt
my
flavor
score
on
this
one
slightly
but
it
was
still
a
brew
that
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
and
wouldnt
mind
doing
so
in
the
future
again
o
would
buy
the
shit
out
of
this
if
allagash
put
this
into
bottle
production
such
a
great
funky
stout
and
the
flavors
here
are
interwoven
so
well
enjoyed
this
immensely
and
highly
recommend
it
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
opaque
dark
amber
more
viscous
than
cloudy
with
no
head
or
sediment
the
nose
has
an
offputting
amount
of
fruity
acetone
upfront
with
candi
sugar
and
oak
doing
little
to
entice
the
taste
has
a
similar
nail
polish
quality
but
more
tartness
and
is
made
drinkable
only
by
a
modest
brown
sugar
sweetness
that
comes
in
on
the
back
end
its
medium
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
with
fruity
sweetness
the
lingering
element
in
its
semidry
finish
there
is
minimal
bitterness
but
alcohol
slowly
creeps
in
for
a
warming
effect
honestly
this
has
been
a
let
down
for
me
considering
the
difficulty
it
was
to
track
down
and
seemingly
promising
ratings
orangey
amber
good
head
definite
wet
dog
funky
farmhouse
freshness
sour
lemon
approachable
flavor
balanced
bittersour
almost
cidery
different
in
a
good
way
overall
good
stuff
if
you
like
a
flanders
style
lot
of
cherry
notes
the
nose
was
a
lot
like
chardonnay
and
the
taste
was
a
little
sweet
and
dry
almost
winelike
o
sweet
and
sour
just
like
i
like
it
this
brew
was
aged
for
about
a
year
so
the
flavors
settled
a
little
but
the
booze
was
very
present
a
good
beer
fruitful
bottled
in
2012
pours
a
clear
brownamber
with
small
head
aroma
is
very
oaky
cherries
and
caramel
malts
alcohol
is
not
very
perceptible
for
such
a
high
abv
sour
but
the
strong
malt
base
is
certainly
distinctive
im
not
surprised
about
the
long
oakaging
period
as
the
taste
is
incredibly
woody
other
flavors
are
coherent
with
aroma
cherries
caramel
with
a
decent
tart
finish
o
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
puckering
sourness
d
really
good
stuff
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
these
guys
when
it
comes
to
funk
worth
it
if
you
can
find
any
at
this
point
to
all
my
cellarheads
out
there
drinks
great
now
and
im
sure
it
will
hold
up
great
for
a
few
more
years
bottled
122012
poured
into
a
teku
delicious
sour
smooth
it
might
have
been
a
tad
more
sour
if
i
drank
a
few
months
ago
but
i
found
this
delicious
anyway
allagash
continues
to
impress
with
their
higherend
beers
with
bold
and
complex
flavors
it
smells
great
and
it
drink
just
as
satisfyingly
i
didnt
get
the
funk
that
others
didsomething
i
noticed
with
most
old
ales
instead
i
got
an
appealing
sour
and
tart
taste
that
is
balanced
by
the
right
amount
of
heat
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
this
again
next
year
overall
interesting
oakaged
sour
but
certainly
nothing
near
the
best
beers
that
allagash
makes
im
looking
at
you
resurgam
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
the
first
beer
they
made
in
their
foeders
allagash
is
the
closest
you
can
get
to
belgium
without
going
there
o
another
amazing
wild
from
allagash
plenty
of
time
in
the
bottle
smoothed
this
baby
out
wonderfully
overall
a
little
disappointing
just
not
very
exciting
o
a
fine
example
here
taste
is
always
subjective
but
this
will
do
o
the
oak
and
balanced
funkacidity
are
the
highlights
on
this
beer
absolutely
delicious
i
have
been
a
big
fan
of
allagashs
sour
program
since
its
inception
a
few
years
back
but
this
beer
really
takes
the
prize
as
being
the
best
of
the
bunch
thus
far
kudos
to
rob
and
company
for
creating
a
flemish
sour
ale
that
competes
with
some
of
the
best
examples
that
belgium
has
to
offer
o
holy
christ
this
is
excellent
lots
of
big
and
round
malt
character
with
all
the
requisite
tartness
and
funk
it
offers
another
dimension
not
found
in
most
sours
a
real
eyeopener
for
those
who
think
only
of
belgium
when
discussing
worldclass
sours
its
too
bad
this
is
such
a
limited
offering
as
i
would
really
like
to
enjoy
much
more
of
this
beer
its
just
delicious
m
medium
body
dry
light
carbonation
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
and
a
nice
balance
of
dry
oak
sweet
vinous
fruit
and
funky
bugs
dry
oak
musty
brett
and
funky
yeast
up
front
followed
by
caramel
malt
sweetness
vinous
fruit
and
lingering
acetic
vinegar
the
acetic
presnce
is
there
but
isnt
harsh
or
overpowering
not
too
solventlike
with
a
nice
vinegary
presnce
complimenting
the
sweet
cherries
and
other
dark
fruit
notes
well
balanced
and
decently
sour
with
a
nice
earthy
oak
flavor
and
substantial
funk
countering
the
acetic
character
m
medium
bodied
it
less
mildly
sticky
on
the
tongue
a
pleasantly
approachable
barrelaged
wild
ale
the
wood
apparently
taking
the
edge
off
of
the
sour
tart
and
funky
essences
i
say
that
without
having
tried
any
other
offering
from
this
brewery
rather
the
sweetness
complements
the
sourness
et
al
to
the
point
of
a
semblance
of
balance
tasty
complex
stuff
this
is
o
funk
and
tart
lemon
and
lots
of
oakiness
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
had
it
at
the
brewery
on
tap
and
loved
it
and
im
happy
to
say
its
just
as
good
from
the
bottle
glad
i
have
3
more
look
forward
to
aging
this
one
and
trying
it
again
further
down
the
road
o
excellent
sour
from
a
great
brewer
not
easy
to
find
so
consider
trading
for
it
o
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
has
some
pleasant
aroma
as
it
warms
however
some
unfavorable
yeasty
bready
characteristics
that
impair
the
flavor
verdict
a
very
nice
wild
ale
from
allagash
yet
another
success
in
their
line
of
sour
and
wild
ales
and
one
of
the
more
peculiar
wild
ales
ive
tried
to
date
with
the
malt
character
definitely
worth
trying
hazy
orange
amber
in
color
with
a
medium
sized
offwhite
colored
head
this
has
a
sweet
and
super
funky
smell
to
it
oak
banana
overripe
berries
musty
damp
forest
the
taste
is
nicely
tart
with
a
light
fruitiness
strawberry
and
raspberry
followed
by
funkiness
and
more
sour
notes
theres
a
slight
buttery
flavor
as
well
but
very
faint
finishing
with
a
pleasant
oaky
dryness
this
beer
hits
all
the
right
spots
theres
a
lot
of
alcohol
at
nearly
9
but
its
very
well
hidden
and
it
drinks
wonderfully
the
carbonation
level
is
quite
good
theres
not
much
lacing
on
the
glass
but
the
head
is
retained
very
well
as
i
drink
this
is
the
first
sour
ive
had
from
allagash
and
it
does
not
disappoint
overall
i
really
like
this
allagash
beer
its
really
solid
it
does
remind
me
of
a
flander
red
but
not
as
sweet
as
most
from
that
beer
style
i
like
the
coolship
beers
much
more
than
this
allagash
beer
but
its
definately
not
a
slacker
it
seems
like
allagashs
calling
card
is
balance
when
it
comes
to
sour
beers
allagash
is
a
fantastic
domestic
sour
brewer
o
overall
an
interesting
wild
ale
a
bit
different
than
most
wilds
out
there
extremely
light
in
funk
sournesstartness
is
quite
low
for
style
too
almost
a
flanders
brown
in
character
more
malt
character
than
most
interesting
interpretation
very
nice
o
really
nice
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
flavors
honestly
might
be
the
best
wild
ale
ive
ever
had
nice
bright
but
wellintegrated
flavors
sweet
and
sour
delicious
and
well
crafted
oda
neat
beer
with
a
ton
of
action
to
really
avert
your
attention
towards
it
was
fun
but
i
dont
think
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
many
on
ba
very
interesting
all
in
all
awesome
complexity
with
a
great
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
fruit
bugs
and
barrel
everything
feels
smooth
and
incheck
not
the
most
complex
or
intense
wild
on
the
market
but
damn
if
its
not
fantastic
heavy
on
the
acetic
and
wood
but
it
works
with
the
sweetness
aging
will
just
make
this
better
firmly
rooted
in
the
traditions
of
the
east
flanders
region
based
in
oudenaarde
zottegem
and
bellegemkortrijk
it
gets
top
marks
as
an
oud
bruin
thanks
brez
this
is
the
shit
very
nice
lots
of
acidity
but
enough
malt
character
to
balance
pour
has
hues
of
orange
through
a
ruby
color
and
a
bubbly
off
white
head
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
oak
and
vanilla
play
off
of
a
strong
cherry
and
fairly
powerful
dusty
presence
taste
is
a
touch
less
bright
and
bit
too
sweet
the
oak
is
played
down
cherry
pie
is
the
center
piece
faintly
dusty
and
moderately
sour
acidity
is
low
in
back
average
carbonation
an
slightly
dry
body
is
a
touch
syrupy
and
rather
full
its
solid
nothing
great
but
decent
american
sour
o
good
tasting
but
overly
carbonated
this
is
not
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
but
its
very
very
good
its
very
complex
with
a
wide
array
of
sour
tart
fruity
oaky
and
funky
notes
ive
certainly
enjoyed
sours
from
allagash
at
fests
and
im
very
thankful
that
ive
now
had
time
to
sit
down
with
a
bottle
i
hope
they
continue
to
develop
their
sour
program
o
a
pretty
good
take
on
the
style
but
its
not
nearly
assertive
enough
to
get
to
the
high
mark
of
the
style
that
resides
in
rodenbach
grand
cru
however
it
might
be
the
best
flanders
red
style
ale
ive
had
outside
of
belgium
this
is
a
very
well
put
together
beer
from
allagash
it
looks
good
the
nose
is
complex
and
nicely
aromatic
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
the
feel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
a
real
undertheradar
beer
thats
well
worth
stocking
up
on
i
have
another
bottle
but
after
that
think
i
will
have
to
pass
just
because
so
pricey
in
comparison
to
other
great
sours
o
overall
its
a
well
done
beer
but
i
prefer
my
wilds
ales
more
lacto
and
pedio
and
less
brett
i
was
hoping
for
much
more
sour
presence
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
but
for
the
price
i
dont
think
its
something
i
would
get
again
even
if
it
were
available
to
me
on
the
shelves
4
o
i
wish
this
beer
was
cheaper
at
almost
9
abv
this
is
so
drinkable
so
refreshing
i
could
sip
on
it
for
a
while
or
drink
it
quick
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
really
nice
beer
that
wine
folks
could
get
into
love
it
glad
i
have
another
bottle

picked
up
a
bottle
at
the
brewery
tasting
room
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
offwhite
surface
coat
of
head
some
very
small
bubbled
carbonation
activity
throughout
the
body
aromas
of
tart
berry
and
cherry
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
booze
some
woody
characteristics
and
a
sour
highlight
very
balanced
and
robust
nose
flavors
are
rich
and
tart
cherry
on
the
forward
tongue
with
a
sour
tang
throughout
wood
character
balances
more
as
the
beer
travels
the
palate
ending
with
an
almost
winelike
feel
at
the
end
of
each
drink
the
carbonation
and
thin
body
lead
to
an
effervescent
feel
in
mouth
with
a
crisp
almost
bubbly
finish
the
tartness
builds
slowly
in
mouth
with
an
underlying
cherry
sweetness
very
fruity
and
very
crisp
with
bold
notes
of
sour
and
tart
tremendous
representation
of
the
style
i
hope
this
stays
in
the
lineup
for
a
while
this
packed
enormous
aroma
and
flavor
in
a
light
body
the
play
in
the
sweet
and
sour
gives
it
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
this
is
the
real
deal
375ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
served
in
my
allagash
chalice
at
55
degrees
pours
a
dull
copper
with
just
the
slightest
haze
head
is
34s
of
an
inch
bright
white
and
rocky
as
it
dissipates
into
a
soapy
slick
delicate
textured
concentric
bands
of
lacing
are
revealed
copious
tiny
bubbles
are
present
effervescing
in
solution
and
also
adhering
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
what
a
great
nose
on
this
beer
tannic
tart
some
vinegary
notes
all
reminiscent
of
a
flanders
red
or
oud
bruin
i
also
get
a
suggestion
of
cherry
sucrets
taste
follows
nose
however
theres
a
slightly
medicinal
quality
to
the
flavor
profile
and
some
vanilla
notes
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
carbonation
is
minimal
but
the
acidity
gives
quite
a
bit
of
character
theres
also
a
trace
of
creaminess
to
the
texture
and
the
finish
is
quite
dry
overall
more
of
a
flanders
redoud
bruin
in
style
than
what
i
have
come
to
associate
with
an
american
wild
enjoyable
but
for
the
price
point
id
go
with
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
o
a
good
sour
overall
a
little
undercarbonated
but
smells
and
tastes
great
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
pleasant
drinking
wild
ale
as
it
wasnt
too
sour
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
at
over
1
per
oz
i
think
ill
skip
going
for
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
ruddy
orangered
with
a
big
tight
creamy
yellowwhite
head
of
tiny
small
packed
bubbles
in
body
the
beer
appears
clean
but
hazy
with
lots
of
bubbles
racing
to
replenish
the
head
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
funky
cherry
fruit
leather
with
a
smell
resting
below
these
scents
and
adding
a
malty
backbone
to
the
yeast
funk
there
is
a
touch
of
deep
funk
in
this
beer
as
well
that
i
cant
decide
if
i
like
it
or
not
it
is
prickly
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
pineapple
then
pine
and
then
compost
but
it
is
not
particularly
displeasing
just
a
little
odd
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
funky
acidic
and
then
very
oddly
bitter
at
first
i
thought
i
might
have
an
infected
bottle
but
as
i
let
the
beer
sit
and
i
sipped
it
more
some
of
the
off
flavors
oddly
mellowed
out
and
the
beer
became
not
bad
i
have
had
this
beer
before
on
tap
however
and
it
was
far
fruitier
and
more
interesting
then
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
with
tart
green
apple
but
then
opens
into
weird
grassy
bitter
and
pear
and
apricot
notes
with
funky
cherry
fruit
leather
thrown
in
the
beer
then
mellows
out
into
smooth
malty
brown
sugar
notes
with
light
caramel
and
funky
notes
thrown
in
throughout
the
taste
the
bitter
occasionally
become
unappetizingly
medicinal
with
a
touch
of
compost
added
in
which
takes
away
from
the
taste
the
tart
green
apple
flavors
seem
to
linger
in
the
mouth
throughout
the
taste
and
then
return
in
the
aftertaste
to
leave
a
nice
pucker
along
with
a
lingering
bitter
medicinal
flavoring
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
heavier
side
of
light
with
prickly
carbonation
that
is
soft
and
fluffy
except
for
its
bite
the
mouth
is
left
puckering
and
oddly
bitter
with
a
weird
saltiness
as
well
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
saliva
filling
the
mouth
to
neutralize
the
acid
overall
this
is
a
weird
beer
i
dont
think
this
one
held
up
as
well
in
the
bottle
and
i
probably
wouldnt
spend
the
money
on
it
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
it
has
off
tastes
and
a
weird
chemically
bitterness
that
gets
better
but
is
never
that
great
on
the
tongue
that
being
said
i
only
realized
now
that
this
beer
is
8
9
alcohol
which
is
impressive
this
is
an
interesting
beer
if
allagash
can
perfect
bottling
what
they
served
on
tap
for
this
beer
then
it
will
be
amazing
but
as
it
is
it
falls
short
an
okay
beer
that
i
would
like
to
see
improve
o
i
cant
say
i
have
had
a
bad
beer
from
allagash
and
this
is
no
exception
powerful
fruity
sour
notes
make
for
a
deliciously
complex
brew
i
would
rate
it
higher
if
not
for
the
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
i
am
particularly
sensitive
to
this
in
some
brett
beers
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
friend
but
at
1oz
i
probably
wont
rush
back
to
the
store
to
grab
more
overall
as
my
first
full
bottle
of
the
american
wild
ale
style
i
can
truly
say
that
im
extremely
impressed
im
a
supporter
of
allagash
and
everything
they
do
so
it
was
only
natural
that
my
first
experience
with
my
style
would
be
brewed
by
them
their
coolship
program
is
definitely
paying
dividends
and
i
really
cant
wait
to
crack
open
the
cerise
i
have
b
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
its
richly
malty
estery
and
tart
its
almost
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
wild
ale
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
o
very
enjoyable
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
good
amount
of
sour
in
my
opinion
not
overwhelming
pours
a
dark
orange
brown
with
a
finger
of
head
pretty
much
the
same
color
as
the
label
smells
extremely
winey
in
an
amazing
way
sour
orange
oak
tannins
grapes
sour
cherries
tons
of
delicious
dry
fruity
notes
coming
through
on
the
nose
taste
is
perfectly
tart
with
lots
of
fruitiness
and
a
slightly
dry
tannic
finish
that
compliments
the
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
coming
through
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
amazing
balance
and
very
complex
the
yeast
did
an
incredible
job
but
doesnt
overpower
the
other
flavors
at
all
o
another
letdown
from
allagash
they
dont
do
anything
special
in
my
opinion
when
i
smelled
this
i
was
very
impressed
and
hoping
they
finally
pulled
one
off
but
i
was
wrong
id
drink
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
fruit
wood
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
interesting
wild
ale
from
allagash
a
stronger
tatnesssourness
could
have
really
sent
this
one
over
the
top
for
me
but
its
still
an
excellent
beer
thats
worth
seeking
out
o
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
complex
each
flavor
is
very
pronounced
but
blends
together
well
in
a
harmonious
fashion
i
would
have
no
problem
polishing
off
a
750ml
of
this
if
they
ever
made
one
by
myself
this
is
a
sour
that
both
serves
as
a
great
anytime
sour
and
also
one
which
would
serve
as
a
great
introduction
to
people
new
to
sours
well
done
allagash
this
is
an
interesting
complex
sour
in
the
flanders
red
ale
style
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
at
around
9
cheers
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
complex
brew
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
type
that
i
have
tried
from
allagash
but
it
certainly
has
me
interested
in
trying
as
many
as
i
can
highly
recommended
o
great
american
wild
from
allagash
not
overwhelmingly
sour
or
funky
but
the
brett
and
lacto
work
extremely
well
together
to
create
a
great
balance
of
funksour
and
barnyard
not
overwhelmingly
pricey
for
an
american
wild
either
especially
by
allagash
standards
get
some
if
you
still
can
strange
that
the
reviews
are
so
high
for
this
one
unsure
if
i
am
unfair
and
my
palate
just
doesnt
like
these
types
of
wilds
but
i
found
the
smell
to
be
a
turnoff
the
taste
to
be
horrible
with
super
sour
fruitiness
and
after
taste
awful
i
wanted
to
really
like
it
being
originally
from
maine
and
normally
loving
allagash
but
i
couldnt
couldnt
even
drink
it
but
luckily
was
with
a
buddy
who
enjoyed
in
would
not
buy
again
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
recommend
it
and
would
buy
it
again
i
think
that
everything
i
have
to
say
was
said
before
i
really
dont
have
any
negatives
for
the
beer
it
is
a
very
impressive
beer
o
would
like
to
have
more
enjoyed
the
barrel
aging
here
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
fluffy
off
white
head
the
head
sticks
around
quite
nicely
the
smell
is
quite
sour
and
funky
with
a
nice
fruity
sweet
note
to
it
the
taste
isnt
as
intensely
sour
as
i
expected
from
the
smell
im
getting
an
herbal
funk
along
with
a
mild
oaky
note
the
taste
has
a
touch
of
herbal
sweetness
to
it
along
with
a
very
tart
finish
the
carbonation
is
very
smooth
with
small
bubbles
the
finish
isnt
as
dry
as
i
thought
it
would
be
additionally
this
goround
i
really
thought
the
rich
sherry
came
through
a
lot
more
and
really
toned
down
the
acidity
i
think
between
the
two
versions
if
they
are
in
fact
different
was
the
second
one
that
said
this
was
also
the
first
sour
i
had
ever
had
so
my
initial
perceptions
about
its
sourness
may
have
just
been
skewed
o
a
fantastic
beer
more
funky
than
tart
but
a
good
amount
of
both
overall
a
nice
beer
not
great
though
compared
to
many
others
m
medium
bodied
some
creaminess
mid
palate
as
a
new
somewhat
american
way
to
achieve
the
taste
texture
and
aroma
of
flanderss
red
ale
much
of
the
same
characteristics
can
be
found
in
this
distinctive
and
exuberant
ale
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
acetobrettcentered
beer
the
acidity
is
balanced
by
a
decent
amount
of
malttannic
sweetness
as
im
new
to
sours
i
keep
discovering
new
and
subtle
little
differences
in
them
poured
this
one
into
a
tulip
and
was
instantly
greeted
by
that
newlyfamiliar
tart
odor
it
has
a
touch
of
sour
cherries
but
was
muted
by
a
bit
of
an
oaken
burnt
smell
as
well
i
started
drinking
it
slightly
chilled
in
the
fridge
where
the
sour
notes
were
prevalent
allowing
the
slight
effervescence
to
play
on
the
tongue
as
it
warmed
though
the
wood
started
to
become
a
lot
more
dominant
compared
to
the
base
tartness
it
took
on
a
bit
of
an
edge
to
it
with
the
oak
getting
aggressive
really
a
terrific
complex
sour
very
tasty
with
a
perfect
and
challenging
sourness
level
overall
a
decent
enough
sour
from
allagash
although
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
some
of
the
others
in
their
lineup
still
that
makes
it
a
mighty
fine
beer
by
a
much
broader
standard
overall
though
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
to
be
drinking
its
like
a
bretty
rodenbach
filled
with
wonderful
bittern
lemon
and
grapefruit
fantastic
stuff
o
sours
for
me
are
like
playing
russian
roulette
though
i
guess
thats
also
how
the
brewer
whos
making
it
feels
i
tend
to
like
the
sweeter
ones
more
although
if
its
too
sour
i
still
wont
like
it
this
one
is
pretty
much
right
on
the
money
lots
of
fruit
characteristics
to
balance
out
the
mediumhigh
level
of
sour
and
a
feel
thats
not
too
harsh
though
my
500th
review
isnt
a
scorcher
its
a
damn
fine
beer
and
thats
good
enough
for
me
forever
in
debt
to
blackbelt5112203
for
this
one
o
a
very
tasty
beer
and
another
very
solid
sour
from
allagash
im
glad
ive
got
another
bottle
of
this
to
hang
onto
o
this
is
a
great
sour
from
allagash
and
i
am
very
happy
that
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
this
is
sour
and
all
the
flavors
work
together
and
are
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
quick
to
drink
o
overall
i
loved
this
one
one
of
the
better
sours
at
the
fest
not
the
most
complex
sour
and
not
as
funky
as
some
of
their
other
beers
but
its
a
great
fruit
forward
sour
i
love
cherries
and
loved
this
one
would
love
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
one
o
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
very
much
so
brewed
to
the
flemish
bruinred
style
but
with
a
nice
little
american
twist
pretty
unreal
levels
of
fruit
flavors
considering
there
was
no
fruit
additions
i
wish
the
beer
wasnt
so
damned
limited
or
expensive
because
this
is
just
excellent
o
one
of
the
better
special
releases
i
have
ever
had
well
worth
the
fifteen
bucks
thank
you
allagash
for
a
balls
to
the
walls
american
sour
alike
none
other
before
it
bien
sur
le
foudre
overall
a
really
good
beer
taste
starts
out
with
a
vinegar
sourness
with
a
well
rounded
oak
character
cherry
presents
a
touch
of
fruity
tartness
acidic
content
is
on
the
high
side
but
i
like
that
carbonation
is
close
to
perfect
with
a
decent
body
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
making
me
believe
this
closer
to
4
5
than
8
9
so
very
impressive
hazy
reddishbrown
with
a
small
amount
of
creamy
head
on
top
aromas
of
tart
cherries
spicy
wood
earthy
fruit
and
a
touch
of
caramel
quite
acidic
flavorwise
tart
fruit
oak
spicy
sharpness
some
tannins
and
a
pleasant
sweetness
dry
yet
slick
medium
body
and
no
trace
of
alcohol
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
still
very
tasty
and
wellcrafted
in
the
flanders
style
i
have
to
wonder
if
they
were
to
blend
this
with
a
younger
beer
if
everything
would
smooth
out
and
take
this
to
the
next
level
oan
very
enjoyable
sour
from
allagash
would
try
again
without
hesitation
d
the
heavy
oak
character
gives
this
a
more
american
spin
and
its
not
quite
as
sweet
as
something
like
rodenbach
i
enjoyed
this
and
its
nice
to
see
that
the
quality
has
been
maintained
or
even
increased
as
allagash
expands
their
wild
program
would
happily
drink
this
again
overall
a
solid
wellcrafted
brew
that
i
would
drink
again
wo
hesitation
but
slightly
misclassified
this
is
a
flanders
red
w
subtle
to
moderate
oude
bruin
characteristics
not
an
american
wild
and
this
is
not
a
negative
reminds
me
a
lot
of
consecration
without
the
red
wine
presence
its
almost
got
a
touch
of
it
though
somehow
o
really
liked
what
i
got
out
of
this
nice
flanders
type
flavors
with
a
mellow
funkyness
layered
in
there
the
cherry
wine
nose
and
flavors
were
great
for
not
having
added
anything
like
that
i
hope
eventually
the
price
comes
down
i
would
definitely
we
willing
to
pay
1214
for
a
750ml
but
for
a
375ml
it
feels
kinda
steep
had
during
brewvival
2013
served
from
tap
into
a
brewvival
sampler
shaker
poured
a
golden
pale
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
funk
subtle
tartness
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wood
funk
earth
fruit
and
subtle
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
was
really
glad
to
see
this
one
show
up
at
the
festival
as
the
reviews
ive
read
on
this
one
as
it
all
sounded
really
good
while
this
one
was
solid
for
the
style
it
didnt
quite
deliver
like
i
would
have
hoped
still
very
nicely
done
and
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
on
tap
pours
a
rich
burgundy
going
into
mahogany
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
sour
cherries
green
apple
oak
first
flavors
that
hit
your
tongue
are
unripe
apple
cooking
spices
with
a
sherry
finish
there
is
a
little
funk
here
light
barnyard
hay
biscuit
and
bread
flavor
the
finish
is
harsh
cloying
acetic
quality
burns
the
back
of
your
throat
this
is
not
a
jaw
cramping
sour
but
more
of
a
slow
heartburn
quality
vomit
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fine
its
certainly
not
viscous
or
vinuous
carbonation
is
ok
the
tour
guide
said
it
best
when
he
described
when
he
would
have
this
beer
i
could
drink
one
glass
with
a
friend
in
front
of
a
fire
while
discussing
chomsky
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
easy
drinking
nice
light
sourtart
flavor
with
a
great
feel
i
highly
recommend
this
overall
i
tried
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
loved
it
and
im
happy
to
say
its
great
out
of
the
bottle
o
overall
a
solid
beer
from
allagash
not
quite
as
good
as
their
coolship
beers
though
just
not
worth
the
price
overall
a
really
solid
wild
ale
from
allagash
the
balance
of
the
red
wine
oak
and
sour
tones
is
well
done
the
alcohol
is
really
deftly
handled
as
well
and
doesnt
feel
too
boozy
o
great
beer
very
complex
lots
of
different
flavors
well
done
multiple
yeast
strains
and
the
oak
aging
contribute
to
a
great
sour
ale
overall
pretty
nice
sour
good
sour
funk
light
fruit
flavors
from
the
wild
yeast
just
a
bit
of
malt
etc
however
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
coolship
beers
and
its
almost
the
same
price
so
hard
to
go
for
more
of
this
despite
being
a
good
sour
this
is
light
bodied
with
nice
sharp
carbonation
another
tasty
brew
from
allagash
medium
body
and
fairlylight
carbonation
expertly
done
one
of
the
best
flandersstyle
beers
that
ive
ever
had
especially
considering
that
its
from
the
u
s
very
impressive
sort
of
reminded
me
of
supplication
but
the
michigan
peaches
made
me
like
this
that
much
more
despite
being
close
to
2
years
old
the
peaches
could
not
have
tasted
any
more
fresh
and
everything
about
this
beer
just
seemed
so
fresh
very
nice
blend
of
fresh
peaches
oak
bourbon
leather
and
supposedly
horse
not
a
flavor
familiar
to
me
just
reading
from
the
label
would
like
to
obtain
another
bottle
in
the
future
or
if
im
lucky
enough
to
try
the
elusive
vsb
one
of
the
best
out
there
without
a
doubt
im
not
a
huge
sour
fan
but
this
was
as
good
a
sour
as
ive
tried
steasy66
unnatural
feelings
for
you
bro
othe
best
sour
i
have
ever
had
this
tasted
like
a
slightly
less
sugary
peach
ring
gummy
so
peachy
slight
sourness
very
tasty
if
you
love
peaches
it
taste
like
you
are
biting
into
a
peach
literally
not
sour
at
all
like
i
expected
great
beer
hazy
burnt
orange
pour
with
a
small
wispy
layer
of
offwhite
bubbles
that
held
pretty
good
in
the
nose
funk
and
peach
not
overly
sour
lots
of
fresh
peach
flesh
in
the
taste
again
not
overly
tart
and
sour
somewhat
earthy
and
mulchy
leather
and
a
little
farmhouse
also
some
almond
in
there
wonder
if
they
left
the
pits
in
the
peaches
body
was
medium
mouthfeel
wasnt
really
crisp
like
i
prefer
in
beers
like
this
more
chewy
with
a
toneddown
acidity
not
bad
overall
new
glarus
is
gifted
when
it
comes
to
fruit
beers
and
while
this
one
is
more
of
a
fruit
beer
than
a
wild
ale
it
is
still
incredible
was
this
an
actual
beer
or
was
i
drinking
a
peach
this
was
sooooo
good
fantastic
top
5
wilds
ive
had
o
delicious
peach
bomb
the
dry
tart
finish
brings
balance
that
i
imagine
might
only
improve
with
a
little
more
time
in
the
bottle
tastes
and
smells
like
biting
into
a
fresh
peach
nothing
short
of
astonishing
the
flavor
follows
with
that
same
peach
ring
flavor
both
being
candy
sweet
and
creamy
theres
then
some
apple
cider
vinegar
as
the
oud
bruin
base
gently
comes
through
medium
plus
tart
and
a
fun
fun
beer
with
that
candy
quality
this
is
amazing
i
had
a
taste
of
very
sour
blackberry
a
while
back
it
was
excellent
this
continues
the
trend
new
glarus
might
be
the
new
masters
in
this
country
of
the
wild
ale
excellent
beer
thats
only
a
spare
whiskers
away
from
the
elite
this
is
literally
the
most
insane
beer
it
was
a
nice
peach
beer
with
a
bit
of
sour
character
but
i
expected
more
from
new
glarus
waiting
in
line
for
20
minutes
was
not
worth
it
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
delicious
but
i
can
also
buy
a
liptons
peach
iced
tea
for
1
50
at
best
this
is
a
slightly
soured
fruit
beer
calling
this
a
wild
ale
is
a
shame
if
you
like
fruit
beers
you
will
enjoy
this
if
your
actually
looking
for
a
wild
ale
with
any
sort
of
complexity
steer
clear
this
is
definitely
the
last
beer
ill
be
having
from
ng
the
overwhelming
aroma
and
taste
element
is
peach
ring
candy
tasty
but
that
slight
artificiality
was
a
detriment
for
me
bottle
in
trade
from
jbwimer
thanks
man
excited
for
this
one
poured
to
my
firestone
walker
barrelworks
teku
pours
dark
hazy
orange
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
bit
with
some
big
bubbles
aroma
is
insane
fresh
peaches
even
feels
like
i
can
smell
the
peach
fuzz
a
bit
of
dry
oak
then
more
juicy
peaches
flavor
follows
with
a
lightly
sour
fresh
peach
flavor
hints
of
oak
throughout
just
a
tad
bit
of
bourbon
a
light
sweetness
the
tartsweetdry
balance
here
is
rather
incredible
medium
bodied
some
prickly
plus
carbonation
sweet
and
smooth
yep
this
is
good
nobody
integrates
fruit
like
new
glarus
had
at
abr
remember
how
peachy
it
was
this
bottle
is
still
the
same
this
beer
does
such
a
great
job
of
bringing
the
peach
flavor
into
the
mix
this
is
the
best
fruit
sour
ive
had
pours
amberorange
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
peach
schnapps
gummy
peach
candy
the
smell
is
good
in
a
way
but
not
what
i
expected
to
find
in
a
beer
very
artificial
taste
follows
the
nose
a
bit
along
with
a
very
slight
tartness
i
would
not
call
this
beer
sour
at
all
big
peach
punch
at
the
beginning
and
then
the
taste
disappears
nothing
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
as
a
cloud
very
interesting
overall
i
thought
this
beer
tasted
very
good
but
was
let
down
by
high
expectations
o
best
peach
nose
on
a
beer
that
ive
ever
smelled
drinks
like
a
fine
sour
brown
with
fresh
peaches
the
tastes
as
expected
is
super
juicy
and
full
of
extremely
sweet
peach
candy
this
definitely
does
not
have
a
fresh
fruit
peach
taste
perfumey
would
probably
be
another
appropriate
adjective
peach
candy
all
the
way
with
hints
of
a
mild
earthy
grainy
dryness
in
the
finish
drying
finish
with
a
lingering
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
very
frothy
but
fairly
soft
carbonation
with
a
little
bit
of
a
tingle
lightmedium
bodied
high
carbonation
tart
crisp
and
refreshing
pours
cloudy
bronze
with
a
nice
full
creamy
head
lots
of
fresh
peach
in
both
smell
and
taste
moderately
sour
with
a
nice
funkiness
lightly
sweet
and
not
acidic
at
all
body
has
a
light
slick
and
clean
feel
not
life
changing
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
just
an
all
around
good
beer
o
this
beer
is
definitely
not
very
sour
peach
or
even
really
a
peach
sour
probably
splitting
hairs
but
i
would
describe
this
as
a
slightly
tart
peach
brown
ale
with
brett
for
what
that
is
worth
peach
oud
bruin
maybe
different
than
i
expected
but
the
rich
peach
taste
and
balanced
complexity
more
than
make
up
for
this
maybe
the
peachiest
beer
i
have
ever
had
which
makes
it
a
winner
in
my
book
o
very
glad
i
traded
for
it
its
no
vsb
i
keep
hearing
this
well
lets
see
about
that
when
i
pop
the
vsb
just
might
be
the
best
smelling
beer
ive
ever
had
smells
like
old
lady
peach
pie
graham
crackers
peach
jam
ripe
peaches
brown
sugar
mercy
me
based
on
reviews
i
was
expecting
less
sourness
but
i
thought
the
tartness
was
just
right
peach
flavor
wasnt
as
pronounced
as
the
aroma
but
still
more
than
satisfactory
what
a
drinking
experience
i
didnt
want
it
to
end
well
after
finally
tasting
this
beast
i
have
to
say
im
a
bit
underwhelmed
id
have
to
say
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
i
do
get
obvious
peach
but
not
smack
you
in
the
face
peach
i
get
a
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
kinda
comes
out
of
nowhere
which
is
interesting
overall
im
happy
to
say
i
tried
it
but
generally
im
whatever
about
it
do
a
remarkable
beer
eminently
drinkable
the
balance
of
malt
and
yeastdriven
flavors
is
superb
with
both
contributing
necessary
complexity
while
allowing
the
fresh
peach
flavors
to
play
the
starring
role
truly
great
stuff
third
and
best
bottle
of
this
one
tastes
like
candied
peach
rings
overall
well
its
nothing
like
vsb
i
know
thats
not
the
fairest
comparison
but
aside
from
a
great
peach
flavor
it
isnt
the
most
outstanding
beer
o
a
real
delight
if
ng
keeps
putting
out
offerings
like
this
from
the
beer
cave
i
expect
this
brewery
will
be
even
more
famous
than
it
already
is
this
is
the
real
deal
pours
a
dark
orange
brown
color
with
some
chunks
of
yeast
in
the
body
lots
of
carbonation
and
head
smells
like
those
peach
ring
candies
buttery
highly
bubbly
mouthfeel
not
as
tart
as
i
thought
itd
be
actually
kind
of
sweet
some
peach
taste
its
pretty
good
hazy
orange
copper
body
with
an
inch
of
soapy
tan
head
malty
peach
aroma
akin
to
a
fuzzy
navel
minus
the
alcohol
sweetness
sweet
peach
juice
hints
of
white
wine
bready
yeast
perhaps
a
touch
of
lacto
sweetness
prevails
mid
palate
leading
to
a
tart
puckering
finish
delicious
pour
is
hazed
brown
with
red
hues
and
a
lot
of
tight
off
white
head
nose
is
very
bright
perfume
like
peach
and
tangerine
with
a
touch
of
dusty
brett
taste
has
that
same
perfume
like
peach
and
tangerine
more
brett
a
tiny
bit
empty
in
the
finish
with
a
moderate
bitterness
body
is
very
juicy
a
touch
oily
well
carbonated
perhaps
in
the
top
three
best
aromas
i
have
ever
smelled
in
beer
so
many
peach
beers
lack
actual
peach
flavor
and
aroma
but
this
is
the
exact
opposite
peaches
in
a
bottle
paired
with
a
great
sour
brown
base
makes
for
a
worldclass
brew
new
glarus
does
fruit
beers
how
they
should
be
there
are
very
few
beers
this
well
made
overall
this
is
a
winner
i
loved
it
and
am
sad
to
have
finished
the
bottle
tons
and
tons
of
peaches
hints
of
bourbon
and
leather
epic
beer
amazing
peach
in
both
the
smell
and
flavor
but
the
malty
base
beer
throws
this
off
a
little
bit
and
doesnt
work
as
well
with
the
peach
as
id
hoped
still
one
of
the
best
peach
flavors
ive
ever
experienced
in
a
beer
shes
a
winner
well
done
new
glarus
i
didnt
and
likely
will
not
have
vsb
but
this
is
delicious
someone
mentioned
that
this
isnt
a
sour
bomb
though
i
think
its
more
sour
than
others
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
does
over
time
and
they
are
mostly
correct
and
resembles
more
of
a
sour
brown
with
peach
and
wild
fruit
notes
it
also
says
that
on
the
bottle
rd
wild
peach
is
honestly
a
pretty
simple
brew
but
in
a
very
tactical
brilliant
way
drink
up
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
ive
been
curious
since
the
whole
new
glarus
sour
explosion
and
i
was
not
let
down
at
all
great
fruit
taste
a
nice
refreshing
tartness
and
good
balance
o
well
the
rd
department
hit
it
out
of
the
ballpark
on
this
one
as
far
as
the
wild
peach
goes
just
a
fantastic
peach
bomb
here
would
like
some
more
sourness
but
its
pretty
clear
the
complexities
of
this
beer
are
going
to
develop
nicely
over
time
drinking
this
one
next
to
fuzzy
made
it
practically
not
sour
at
all
in
comparison
cant
wait
for
this
beer
in
another
6
months
to
a
year
time
fantastic
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
what
sour
in
the
rye
with
peaches
was
like
when
it
was
first
releast
peach
up
front
and
center
ng
tearing
up
the
fruit
beer
department
once
again
this
reeked
of
peaches
and
was
extremely
fruity
par
for
the
course
for
new
glarus
taste
was
bright
and
champagnelike
at
first
but
never
kicked
in
with
a
substantial
tartness
or
acidity
peach
flavor
prominent
throughout
but
the
lack
of
acid
made
it
unbalanced
and
a
little
watery
this
drinks
great
now
but
should
improve
in
the
upcoming
months
overall
this
is
really
good
but
i
see
the
potential
for
a
lot
more
dryness
and
sourness
as
this
ages
i
can
see
this
beer
becoming
a
pretty
big
deal
in
6
months
for
those
hardcore
sour
lovers
out
there
dan
has
done
it
again
another
awesome
fruited
wild
ale
by
dan
carey
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
unreal
it
smells
like
canned
peaches
a
fresh
bag
of
peach
rings
and
the
freshest
peach
flesh
youve
ever
picked
from
an
orchard
really
hard
to
not
just
keep
smelling
this
beer
the
color
of
the
beer
looks
like
caramelized
peaches
in
a
cobbler
light
brown
essentially
nice
wispy
carb
throughout
you
get
that
distinct
natural
fermentation
smell
and
taste
that
really
set
these
open
fermentation
beers
apart
really
light
lemony
tartness
and
a
rich
peach
flavor
not
as
much
peach
as
the
nose
but
as
much
as
ive
ever
had
from
a
beer
the
carb
carries
the
flavor
perfectly
and
this
beer
does
nothing
but
get
better
as
it
warms
this
isnt
big
on
sour
its
a
naturally
fermented
beer
with
some
light
funk
and
some
tartness
seek
this
beer
out
if
you
love
peaches
not
if
you
desire
tonguebuckling
sourness

about
8
months
postrelease
i
just
have
to
add
that
this
is
nothing
short
of
astounding
this
has
really
evolved
over
the
past
year
to
develop
more
of
an
acidity
and
funk
without
any
fading
of
the
peach
flavours
incredibly
the
aroma
smells
very
fou
founelike
and
if
you
know
how
i
like
my
beers
thats
high
praise
it
doesnt
follow
as
well
on
the
palate
but
its
still
very
peach
forward
and
funky
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
without
reservation
it
will
likely
continue
to
drink
very
well
from
here
on
i
guess
the
biggest
thing
of
note
here
is
that
this
is
named
appropriately
and
those
expecting
the
very
sour
peach
or
an
identical
beer
to
vsb
with
peach
as
a
substitute
are
bound
to
be
confused
or
disappointed
those
looking
for
a
peach
forward
sour
brown
with
a
hint
of
wild
character
and
the
potential
for
increased
sourness
over
time
will
likely
be
quite
pleased

is

so

really
ran
a

looking

having
another
of

have
a
bottle
doing
a
little

time
i
hope
i
can
let
it
sit
for
awhile
to
see
how
it
taste
after
some
time
but
changes
are

this

nothing
incredible
this
would
be
a
good
intro
to
sour
beers
especially
for
converting
wine
drinkers
o
refreshingly
drinkable
with
a
profile
that
has
some
nice
tart
and
wine
properties
not
as
complex
as
some
other
wild
and
sour
ales
likely
in
part
to
bring
a
100
brett
beer
boldly
tart
up

as
your
tastebuds
adjust
the
fruity
elements
begin
to
dominate

flavor
light

this
is

offering

pretty
good
sour
i
like
that
this
has
the
citrus
flavors
rather
than
the
horse
blanket
flavor
i
think
that
i
would
have
this
a
little
colder
than
i
did
on
this
one
it
was
only
about
60f
when
i
drank
it
somewhere
around
50f
would
be
better
for
sure
for
the
price
of
this
this
bottle
was
12
oz
and
cost
18
isnt
worth
it
unless
you
are
really
into
sours
if
you
see
it
for
a
decent
price
its
not
bad
total
4450
pours
gold
with
a
one
finger
head
but
not
for
long
smell
is
very
mellow
slightly
tart
with
some
fruity
qualities
and
a
brett
smell
as
well
picking
up
some
green
apple
and
grapes
getting
a
lot
of
these
flavors
in
the
taste
not
too
sour
slightly
tart
with
some
apple
peach
grape
flavors
up
front
and
some
nice
carbonation
to
make
it
tingle
on
the
tongue
a
little
bit
of
brett
and
funk
but
mostly
dominated
by
fruit
flavors
an
amazing
balance
really
also
some

mixed
in
around

very

o
4

good
beer
not
that
much

flavor
sessionable
expensive
and
not

in

places
though
o
just
a
beautiful
beer
refreshingly
tart

drinkable
yet
provides
a
solid
array
of
flavors
and
aromas
not
as
complex
as
its
bacteria
inoculated
cousins
for
obvious
reasons
but
is
a
fantastically
balanced
example
of
a
100
brett
beer
right
on
vinnie
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
fresh
and
on
tap
after
a
year
it
gets
a

really

that
i
would
definitely
have

o

not
nearly
the
best
worth
a
try
as
are
all
their

i
wish
i
had
made
more
notes
but
that
is
all
i
have
i
will
seek
this
one
out
in
the
future
o
so
many

notes
throughout
with
whitewinelike

with
just
enough
funk
snuck

sour

not
completely
puckering
this

is

o
ahh
one
of

ive
had
had
temptation
last
night
but
this
is
way
better
not
as
sour
not
as
winey
very
crisp
and
refreshing
not
as
complex

it
works
well
nice
refreshing

really
ups
the

not
overpowering
either

poured
a

with

that
grew
to
a

stayed
around
as
a
ring
of
white
as
the
glass
was
emptied
leaving
some
thin

with
a

flavor
and
aftertaste
as
well
as
a
dry
finish
a
very
sour
flavor
with
all
sorts
of
sour
fruit
and
sour
funk
flavors
very
nice
with
some
complexity
brought
in
by
the
sourdough
bread
and
oak
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
nice
refreshing
feel
with
a
drying
finish
nice
and
drinkable
on
point
for
a
sour
very
good
overall
this
is
a
very
good
sour
the
100
brett
gives
it
that
incredibly
sour
flavor
but
it
manages
a
bit
of
complexity
in
spite
of
it
that
gives
it
a
fine
flavor
profile
very
good
and
i
wish
i
could
get
it
easier
i
think
my
next
one
has
to
be
the
bruerys
tart
of
darkness
just
to
keep
the
trend
going
this
is
only
the
2nd
of
the
sour
beers
i
have
tried
from
rr
the
first
was
supplication
supplication
was
way
better
as
there
were
more
flavors
coming
from
the
fruits
however
this
is
a
good
beer
and
im
glad
to
try
it
rr
makes
so
many
sours
that
i
have
to
try
others
before
trying
this
one
again
mouthfeel
bone
dry
light
and
refreshing
overall
not
as
tart
as
the
other
rr
sours
not
as
powerful
or
as
big
bodied
but
very
nice
lots
of
unique
flavors
scary
drinkable
and
overall
a
great
beer
good
beer
but
not
russian
rivers
best
a
classic
sour
from
rr
a
lazy
straw
yellow
small
cream
head
with
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
mouth
feel
is
sour
and
dry
flavors
of
tart
apples
with
a
slight
sweet
aftertaste
some
slight
herb
bitterness
but
not
from
the
hops
kind
of
like
an
apple
sour
candy
on
drugs
what
a
beer
this
is
patience
is
a
virtue
and
i
believe
this
beer
is
over
a
year
in
the
making
from
mash
to
bottling
a
perfect
example
of
craft
beer
being
art
and
brewers
becoming
legends
mouthfeel
is
good
starts
off
pretty
medium
overall
very
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
consistent
most
of
the
way
with
a
nice
dry
and
tart
finish
almost
makes
you
pucker
pretty
much
have
to
force
yourself
not
to
smile
really
drinkable
a
nice
sipper
for
my
taste
i
like
it
a
lot
im
starting
to
understand
all
the
hype
around
russian
river
nices
sour
tart
citrus
and
some
sweetness
610
sourness
medium
high
carb
with
semi
dry
finish
o
being
my
first
sour
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
at
first
the
sourness
hits
your
palate
pretty
hard
but
eases
after
it
swooshed
around
a
couple
times
it
is
very
carbonated
and
poured
a
thick
head
with
lots
of
bubbles
the
fruity
and
citrus
taste
is
prevalent
throughout
overall
a
very
tasty
quality
sour
overall
a
fantastically
balanced
sour
and
one
i
could
see
being
a
gateway
for
people
looking
to
get
into
sour
ales
tart
but
not
overpowering
and
highly
drinkable
o
great
smell
good
flavor
however
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
field
of
american
wilds
doesnt
have
quite
the
depth
and
complexity
of
others
o
a
more
complex
and
subdued
sour
than
i
expected
still
wonderful
but
not
my
favorite
of
rr
sours
o
not
a
funky
beer
per
the
fermented
with
100
brett
on
the

its

verdict
a
wonderful
wile
ale
from
russian
river
not
that
its
a
surprise
despite
the
lack
of
wood
aging
and
bugs
this
beer
is
still
quite
balanced
and
amply
complex
a
definite
must
try
for
anyone
who
likes
sours
o
i
had
the
pleasure
of
picking
this
up
at
rr
earlier
this
year
and
lets
just
say
the
trip
was
definitely
worth
it
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
and
retention
was
both
very
thin
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
sour
note
as
well
as
a
nice
subtle
malt
essence
in
there
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
really
well
balanced
between
the
sour
elements
and
the
beer
itself
its
got
a
very
good
1
2
punch
going
from
sour
to
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
very
drinkable
this
is
also
on
the
refreshing
side
overall
this
russian
river
brew
hits
many
of
the
high
notes
it
should
and
it
worth
checking
out
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
o
despite
being
fermented
with
100
brett
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
funky
ale
its
more
fruity
and
tart
than
funky
thats
fine
its
a
tasty
beer
but
its
my
least
favorite
rr
sour
overall
russian
river
does
it
again
i
feel
they
pretty
much
own
the
awa
category
at
this
point
in
my
young
sour
appreciating
life
very
quaffable
full
of
complex
flavours
that
satisfy
my
palate
without
overloading
it
while
not
being
too
heavy
on
any
one
particular
characteristic
i
am
a
big
fan
and
will
continue
to
seek
out
the
russian
river
offerings
whenever
i
can
get
them
and
you
should
too
4

the
aroma
bodes

with
some

intimidating
given
that
the
taste
was
a
bit
better
but
still
too
funky
nicely

with
a
hint
of

fine

feel
awesome
i
want
to
drink
these
all
summer
but
i
cant
because
i
live
in
tn
occasionally
i
must
though
i
do
love
a
good
unique
beer
and
russian
river
has
certainly
come
up
with
one
with
this
what
the
heck
is
a
sour
blond
well
unless
you
find
one
of
these
you
may
never
know
it
is
that
unique
it
is
really
sour
almost
as
if
they
dosed
it
with
lemon
zest
and
the
result
is
a
treasure
it
is
not
the
most
beautiful
beer
ive
ever
seen
the
head
is
average
the
abv
is
average
but
when
this
brew
hits
your
palate
youll
know
what
a
sour
blond
is
it
only
takes
a
moment
wow
ok
i
admit
that
a
trip
to
the
rr
brewery
helped
so
i
waited
to
review
a
bottle
the
small
taster
at
the
home
pub
at
rr
was
not
enough
to
judge
but
now
that
i
have
opened
a
bottle
i
am
convinced
that
this
is
a
world
class
occasional
beer
unlike
those
great
ipas
drinkable
by
the
gallon
this
one
requires
a
bit
of
time
to
enjoy
and
savor
in
its
uniqueness
lest
it
be
confused
this
is
not
a
hop
beer
it
is
a
blond
that
happens
to
pucker
have
i
mentioned
unique
yes
try
and
youll
be
aware
that
a
real
style
can
deliver
i
have
no
idea
but
i
guess
the
brewmaster
had
a
demonic
possession
and
he
just
broke
out
of
hell
with
santification
try
it
but
be
prepared
to
pucker
and
enjoy
overall
this
bottle
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
it
was
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
on
tap
last
month
i
bought
the
bottle
from
the
taproom
and
am
assuming
theyre
from
the
same
years
batch
maybe
the
keg
had
some
age
though
in
either
event
i
stocked
up
and
have
four
more
in
the
cellar
ill
be
back
in
a
few
years
d
not
overly
complex
but
still
highly
drinkable
the
tartness
is
pretty
mellow
and
this
is
definitely
more
on
the
barnyard
side
of
brett
a
good
beginner
brew
for
people
looking
to
get
into
sours
overall
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
rr
sours
ive
tried
but
still
an
excellent
beer
refreshing
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
it
tastes
kind
of
like
a
sour
saison
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
o
very
refreshing
beer
to
have
during
a
hot
summer
day
or
late
at
night
when
your
craving
something
out
of
the
ordinary
or
even
when
treating
yourself
to
something
special
for
no
real
occasion
like
my
self
at
the
moment
but
regardless
really
enjoying
this
rr
brew
very
unique
brew
with
a
light
and
subtle
character
yet
complex
and
unique
i
guess
thats
what
you
get
when
you
have
a
brewery
in
the
heart
of
california
wine
country
a
brewery
and
beer
that
speaks
for
itself
and
stands
out
naturally
overall
a
really
interesting
display
of
brettanomyces
displays
the
full
capabilities
of
the
yeast
from
start
to
finish
the
cleanest
expression
of
this
bug
that
ive
come
across
othis
is
another
great
russian
river
wildsour
ale
brewers
can
sometimes
overplay
their
hand
when
it
comes
to
brett
beers
but
this
one
manages
to
keep
the
smell
and
flavors
that
brett
imparts
without
making
brett
the
only
thing
going
on
im
not
sure
if
this
was
the
right
beer
to
drink
on
a
snowy
march
evening
but
i
will
certainly
search
this
out
again
in
warmer
seasons
another
damn
good
russian
river
wild
ale
i
dont
think
its
possible
for
them
to
put
out
a
bad
one
this
is
probably
one
of
the
more
funky
ones
that
ive
had
but
it
still
had
an
intense
sour
element
right
off
the
bat
so
nothing
was
lost
in
that
department
thanks
again
to
jeff
for
breaking
this
one
out
o
like
i
said
above
my
favorite
sour
to
date
ultra
balanced
between
the
flavor
profile
level
of
sourness
and
mouthfeel
just
an
excellent
beer
would
buy
this
again
and
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
easy
to
drink
but
not
boring
nice
layers
of
complex
flavors
make
this
one
a
top
notch
american
wild
ale
o
a
decent
russian
river
beer
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
new
belgiams
brett
beer
very
nice
balance
between
funk
and
tart
very
cool
unique
beer
here
this
brew
pours
hazy
light
amber
with
some
sediment
and
a
very
thin
head
smell
is
mostly
of
yeast
and
bretts
with
some
grapefruit
pear
and
apple
you
can
smell
just
how
tart
this
beer
is
and
the
taste
is
there
to
match
tons
of
citrus
predominantly
lemon
and
lime
tart
and
crisp
very
refreshing
served
very
cold
fairly
dry
and
not
overly
acidic
very
light
with
tons
of
carbonation
stimulates
every
taste
receptor
in
your
mouth
and
makes
you
salivate
super
clean
finish
just
leaves
you
wanting
more
a
little
pricey
but
super
drinkable
this
is
a
new
favorite
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
heavy
tartness
to
the
nose
and
flavoring
and
the
broad
sweeping
complexity
of
it
from
the
time
you
pop
the
bottle
your
nose
fills
with
this
juicy
insanely
funky
beast
of
an
aroma
with
crisp
paler
malts
and
an
accompaniment
of
yeast
fruits
and
musky
components
these
translate
well
through
the
taste
buds
with
a
massive
bittering
tartness
from
the
first
drop
to
the
last
the
nicely
retained
head
affords
soft
creaminess
to
every
sip
and
helps
sanctification
hold
up
proudly
amongst
its
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
series
o
great
sour
not
the
best
at
russian
river
but
worth
trying
none
the
less
o
this
beer
is
a
great
marriage
of
sour
and
blond
the
brett
plays
a
great
key
role
i
throughly
enjoyed
this
beer
especially
the
taste
and
feel
it
is
not
mindblowing
but
it
is
a
really
solid
sour
and
another
impressive
offering
from
rr
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
overall
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
complex
yet
very
thirst
quenching
and
refreshing
the
brettanomyces
really
takes
on
a
hugely
tropical
tone
in
this
beer
and
makes
the
beer
only
slightly
tart
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
both
the
sour
novice
and
the
seasoned
sour
head
highly
recommended
odanother
welltrained
stud
from
russian
river
not
my
favorite
tion
but
its
better
than
80
of
anything
sour
i
have
tried
next
time
i
have
a
chance
i
will
gladly
lay
lip
to
this
wacky
bretty
beast
this
is
very
nice
russian
river
has
a
good
portfolio
of
great
sours
o
this
is
crazy
infected
and
it
adds
brilliant
character
to
the
beer
almost
becomes
too
much
but
i
finished
the
entire
bottle
and
wanted
more
get
some
overall
i
think
this
is
more
brett
forward
sour
than
a
tart
sour
beer
i
really
liked
it
and
its
just
another
wonderful
offering
for
the
sours
line
up
at
russian
river
this
is
like
drinking
two
different
beers
at
the
same
time
the
front
end
is
incredibly
juicy
and
fruity
while
the
back
end
dries
up
quickly
with
oak
and
funk
light
tartness
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
very
nice
o
very
light
on
the
acidity
and
sourness
but
still
very
tasty
with
the
funk
and
base
blonde
overall
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
for
my
first
time
sampling
it
i
was
always
hesitant
because
of
the
inflated
price
tage
but
for
5
on
draft
at
a
bar
during
zwanze
day
why
not
give
it
a
go
or
2
i
enjoy
this
offering
more
than
supplication
as
i
feel
it
is
a
bit
more
complex
and
the
flavor
profile
pops
just
a
bit
more
overall
my
favorite
sour
from
rr
havent
had
beat
yet
great
stuff
light
body
good
carbonation
o
great
beer
from
russian
river
that
reminds
me
of
a
tarter
and
more
lively
version
of
orval
it
has
a
nice
mix
between
brett
funk
and
the
tart
sour
flavors
you
come
to
expect
from
russian
river
really
was
surprised
by
how
good
this
on
was
great
citrus
flavor
with
nice
barrel
and
vinous
notes
an
excellent
example
of
a
pale
american
wile
ale
o
one
of
the
closer
awas
that
i
have
tried
to
get
the
gueuze
style
really
delicious
and
refreshing
love
that
sour
bite
overy
enjoyable
simply
wellcrafted
this
is
a
pretty
even
and
smooth
wild
ale
nothing
really
showy
but
its
consistent
and
smooth
the
brett
is
in
no
way
obnoxious
or
outlandish
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
in
no
way
blowing
me
away
its
good
yeah
but
there
is
no
real
outstanding
character
consistent
sure
amazing
not
so
much
so
o
this
was
kind
of
similar
to
a
much
less
funky
more
barnyard
version
of
beatification
there
were
definitely
some
nice
things
going
on
in
this
beer
and
its
definitely
better
then
your
average
sour
however
i
would
take
beat
any
day
over
sanctification
the
souring
did
add
a
nice
presence
to
the
blonde
ale
which
you
can
still
taste
the
presence
of
underneath
overall
id
definitely
recommend
trying
this
beer
but
cant
recommend
it
over
other
offerings
such
as
beatification
and
sanctification
d
very
easy
to
crush
this
one
the
sour
elements
are
beyond
accessible
and
it
does
the
job
in
terms
of
avoiding
funk
while
still
giving
off
apparent
brett
easy
recommendation
here
o
rr
is
amazing
sanctification
is
an
excellent
sour
that
i
highly
recommend
seeking
out
the
usage
of
brett
in
the
brew
is
excellent
overall
a
very
good
blonde
sour
beer
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
wild
ales
but
this
one
is
approachable
and
enjoyable
a
solid
brew
although
ive
had
better
from
rr
very
tame
could
be
a
beginner
sour
thanks
stupac2
o
this
is
my
last
offering
that
was
brought
home
from
russian
river
im
sad
to
see
them
all
drank
but
happy
that
i
got
to
try
them
russian
river
truly
brews
wonderful
flavorful
and
creative
beers
appearance
is
straw
yellow
with
a
very
slight
haze
fair
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
very
much
reminds
me
of
belgian
pale
ales
and
strong
ales
a
nice
yeasty
aroma
hints
of
banana
and
bread
lots
of
lemon
in
the
taste
mildmoderately
sour
bit
of
bitterness
as
the
beer
warms
up
soft
carbonation
provides
a
nice
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
this
is
probably
my
favorite
american
wild
ale
yet
i
like
that
its
lighter
sour
with
a
decent
amount
of
tartness
and
its
basically
just
not
too
over
the
top
of
an
am
wild
ale
though
i
am
sometimes
in
the
mood
for
a
mouthpuckeringly
sour
beer
this
beer
is
nothing
like
that
and
i
could
probably
have
one
of
these
just
about
any
time
this
could
actually
be
a
pretty
good
intro
beer
to
those
who
havent
yet
ventured
into
the
world
of
sourswild
ales
really
good
and
quite
drinkable
o
a
fantastic
beer
and
im
extremely
happy
with
it
i
would
trade
for
it
again
shutout
to
dovalihops
for
the
bottle
o
superlight
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
highly
recommended
will
have
again
this
is
a
tasty
beer
thats
not
too
funky
and
rather
dry
o
well
done
not
quite
a
good
as
some
of
the
other
rr
offerings
but
still
very
good
i
would
certainly
get
more
given
the
chance
recommend
o
fairly
good
drinkability
something
i
could
have
fairly
often
very
well
crafted
bottle
poured
a
slightly
dirty
bright
yellow
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
brett
is
quite
intense
and
dominates
with
light
tart
and
dry
notes
also
being
noticeable
taste
is
mostly
dominated
by
dry
and
tart
notes
with
some
malt
also
perceptible
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
brewed
though
maybe
a
tad
too
onedimensional
with
the
brett
notes
and
not

favourite

note
batch

thanks
to
my
amazing
wife
for
bringing
this
one
home
from
a
business
trip
to
la
still
delicious
very
lively
carbonation
tart
acidity
and
dryness
combine
to
make
this
beer
very
quick
on
the
palate
however
as
it
sits
and
settles
slower
more
nuanced
tasting
can
be
achieved
tart
lemon
acidity
up
front
some
grassy
flavors
and
a
hint
of
grainy
malt
as
well
overall
the
tart
acidic
citrus
dominates
musty
yeasty
funk
comes
in
midpalate
very
dry
finish
with
some
almostpuckerinducing
grapefruit
lingering
horse
blanket
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
for
how
wild
it
is
another
great
rr
sour
o
defines
brett
nicely
refreshingly
tart
and
not
overly
sour
i
could
session
this
forever
on
nice
warm
summer
days
well
done
american
wild
ale
by
russian
river
who
never
lets
me
down
while
there
could
be
more
to
it
i
suppose
this
is
what
it
was
designed
to
be
i
think
an
homage
to
brett
o
heard
some
orval
comparisons
but
again
the
euro
makers
do
it
better
orval
blows
this
out
of
the
water
good
though
a
d
very
drinkable
really
nicely
balanced
wild
ale
the
tartness
is
really
nice
and
the
finish
is
crisp
and
refreshing
very
well
done
rr
just
have
beatification
left
o
pretty
good
but
probably
my
least
favorite
rr
wild
thus
far
almost
more
like
a
slightly
tart
belgian
ale
still
very
tasty
though
and
would
certainly
never
pass
on
it
o
this
beer
really
good
borderline
heavenly
i
wish
i
lived
on
the
west
coast
so
i
could
have
regular
access
to
it
cheers
much
more
a
betyer
beer
okder
than
new
a
thermd
im
not
surthe
newer
will
age
as
well
might
beer
a
different
yeast
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
to
me
enjoyable
beers
in
the
russian
river
lineup
overall
impression
i
enjoy
the
simplicity
of
sanctification
its
an
easysipping
wild
ale
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
o
really
pleasant
beer
not
necessarily
puckering
sour
but
a
good
amount
of
tartness
i
prefer
the
supplication
for
sure
but
this
is
a
nice
light
warm
weather
beer
my
first
experience
with
a
rr
sour
its
good
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
of
a
bummer
didnt
quite
live
up
to
what
i
was
hoping
hopefully
beatification
will
be
more
rewarding
not
a
bad
beer
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
tions
there
is
a
pleasant
tartness
but
i
could
use
more
lacto
and
a
little
less
brett
as
the
mustiness
got
overpowering
at
times
still
will
go
back
but
not
as
often
as
the
others
body
is
medium
in
heft
with
prickly
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
from
some
residual
sugars
carbonation
feels
right
for
the
beer
avoiding
having
a
somewhat
acidic
beer
linger
on
the
palate
too
long
o
im
admittedly
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
sour
beers
and
i
was
a
bit
intimidated
before
i
opened
this
one
however
i
ended
up
thoroughly
enjoying
it
the
sourness
is
not
at
all
aggressive
and
while
it
is
present
it
presents
more
like
a
tart
than
sour
and
even
then
it
is
balanced
by
a
mild
sweetness
a
very
nice
beer

awesome
beer
and
would
be
great
for
a
blazing
hot
day
head
is
thin
and
bubbly
and
gone
quickly
not
the
prettiest
a
blonde
sour
but
i
was
a
bit
bummed
that
the
brett
was
so
in
the
background
cosmicevanaug
05
and
some
barnyard
qualities
the
flavor
has
lots
of
tart
citrus
a
bit
overdone
just
in
parts
but
i
do
like
a
good
sour
beer
and
this
is
definitely
a
good
sour
beer
maybe
some
more
age
on
this
would
mellow
out
the
sharp
edges
i
love
this
beer
its
a
great
aperitif
its
a
great
sunny
afternoon
sipper
yearround
in
los
angeles
if
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
complex
heights
of
temptation
or
beatification
at
their
best
it
trumps
them
in
cost
and
accessibility
consistency
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
ensure
when
youre
gambling
in
mother
natures
casino
but
knock
on
wood
i
cant
recall
a
single
sample
of
russian
river
beer
that
was
tainted
or
spoiled
in
any
way
if
youre
trying
wild
ales
for
the
first
time
start
with
one
of
the
many
tion
beers
any
will
do
but
sanctification
is
a
safe
bet
it
is
not
only
among
the
most
highest
rated
but
is
also
probably
the
one
likely
to
be
most
agreeable
to
an
unfamiliar
audience
topnotch
brew
its
remarkable
how
clean
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
isusually
the
rr
sours
are
about
depth
complexity
and
mindblowingnessthis
is
perhaps
the
perfect
summer
drinking
beer
crisp
refreshing
and
biting
lovely
beer
o
a
simple
but
well
done
take
on
the
style
drinks
fantastically
on
a
rainy
summer
night
o
very
refreshing
due
to
the
body
and
tart
crispness
more
potent
than
one
would
expect
i
wouldnt
drink
several
bottles
but
i
would
buy
this
selection
several
times
very
solid
beer
and
an
excellent
first
impression
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
a
finger
of
pure
white
foam
soso
retention
and
minimal
lacing
smells
like
sour
lemon
in
a
nonharsh
way
brett
nice
floral
and
freshly
cut
grass
notes
long
finish
taste
is
brett
crisp
lemon
and
floral
slight
sweetness
a
nice
moderate
level
of
acidity
gives
this
a
very
good
level
of
bite
medium
carbonation
and
body
no
alcohol
at
all
here
overall
although
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
barrel
aged
sours
from
rr
best
because
of
the
complexity
this
is
very
tasty
and
refreshing
great
for
warm
weather
days
this
had
enough
sweetness
and
body
to
pair
quite
well
with
indian
food
this
was
the
latest
rr
sour
to
finally
hit
philadelphia
this
was
sampled
months
back
so
this
review
is
off
of
old
notes
this
beer
poured
a
straw
pale
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
similar
to
a
tart
chardonnay
with
notes
of
white
grapes
sour
apples
with
some
brett
the
taste
consisted
of
notes
of
what
was
mentioned
in
the
aroma
above
with
the
funk
more
in
the
forefront
there
was
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
which
coated
the
toungue
on
every
sip
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
compared
to
some
of
the
other
rr
sours
that
were
so
tart
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
have
more
than
one
in
one
sitting
another
solid
beer
by
russian
river
overall
eh
refreshing
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
honestly
id
have
to
say
that
i
think
this
one
is
a
little
overrated
just
like
supplication
when
i
see
sour
written
on
the
label
i
expect
to
taste
sour
but
this
simply
wasnt
the
case
here
consecration
still
tops
my
list
among
the
rr
sours
pours
a
clear
yellow
body
with
a
small
carbonated
white
head
smell
of
pepper
and
aroma
of
lemon
grapefruit
leather
and
graininess
taste
is
tart
and
slightly
has
a
flavor
of
lemon
hay
and
grapefruit
with
a
tart
peppery
finish
damn
refreshing
and
tasty
even
when
warming
o
very
excellent
beer
when
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
rr
catalog
i
would
consider
this
by
far
the
most
sessionable
of
all
the
sours
i
could
sip
on
this
beer
everyday
after
work
overall
this
is
just
a
really
good
beer
i
dont
know
if
it
lives
up
to
the
high
high
bar
set
by
its
russian
river
brethren
but
i
find
it
delicious
and
refreshing
and
definitely
worth
having
at
least
once
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
rr
sours
it
is
crisp
refreshing
and
jawbreakingly
sour
which
i
like
but
there
is
a
lack
of
depth
to
this
as
compared
to
the
other
sours
in
the
flight
o
i
always
like
their
stuff
feeling
a
little
biased
but
they
do
make
wonderful
beers
o
a
really
good
beer
compared
to
the
other
reviews
here
it
looks
like
i
dig
it
just
a
bit
less
but
for
sure
worth
checking
out

you

this
one
had
a
nice
pop
when
i
pulled
the
cork
it
poured
a
nice
moderately
cloudy
gold
in
color
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
bright
white
head
that
just
sits
atop
the
beer
for
minutes
on
end
it
resembles
a
quality
berliner
weiss
it
smells
of
light
citrus
light
yeast
some
hay
light
grapefruit
is
lighty
acidic
and
has
what
id
describe
as
tartness
not
so
much
sour
the
flavors
consist
of
sour
grapefruit
sour
apples
brett
lemons
and
it
has
a
nice
tart
and
dry
finish
it
drinks
light
and
only
moderately
dry
i
find
it
the
most
drinkable
of
the
russian
river
sours
that
ive
tried
thus
far
it
just
has
really
nice
balance
overall
i
really
like
this
one
and
prefer
it
to
their
other
rotating
sours
overall
this
was
very
enjoyable
it
reminds
me
of
cantillon
gueuze
but
not
as
balanced
o
great
love
it
want
it
age
it
spread
it
great
go
to
sour
as
long
as
i
got
10
bucks
to
throw
down
on
a
glass
mouthfeel
smooth
for
a
sour
love
it
great
carbonation
like
most
of
their
beers
perhaps
not
as
much
going
on
flavorwise
as
consecration
or
supplication
but
its
still
a
great
beer
and
a
mouthpuckering
sour
recommended
for
sure
dvery
palatable
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
wonderful
after
a
full
day
of
walking
all
over
sunny
san
francisco
looks
like
chicha
cloudy
yellow
hazy
milky
lookin
masterpeice
frothy
creamy
off
white
head
smells
like
sour
apple
mmmm
amazing
smell
tastes
super
sour
and
slightly
puckering
this
is
funky
from
the
brett
woohoo
this
is
so
balanced
and
tasty
tingly
dry
feel
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
lighter
but
with
a
distinct
fruitlike
sourness
that
is
completely
pleasing
i
want
more
of
this
overall
its
not
the
brettiest
tartest
our
sourest
beer
on
the
block
but
its
comfortable
in
its
own
skin
and
aint
that
whats
its
all
about
very
drinkable
i
still
need
more
time
with
sours
and
wilds
to
get
a
feel
for
them
but
this
one
was
a
nice
introduction
im
still
not
sure
what
barnyard
funk
and
hay
taste
like
but
someday
i
will
get
there
i
will
be
enjoying
many
of
these
if
the
weather
gets
nice
and
hot
o
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
that
went
down
very
quickly
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
something
id
love
to
pick
up
again
to
drink
as
well
as
lay
some
down
to
age
russian
river
is
the
king
of
the
american
wild
ale
d
overall
this
is
an
amazing
sour
by
russian
river
wish
i
could
get
them
more
often
but
i
enjoy
them
while
i
have
them
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
finger
of
frothy
head
that
retained
well
yeasty
aroma
with
lots
of
light
fruits
and
some
underlying
spice
yeasty
and
grassy
to
the
taste
a
sweet
malty
base
with
sour
notes
of
lemon
zest
pear
apples
and
white
wine
and
a
tad
of
peppery
spice
in
there
somewhere
crisp
hop
bitterness
and
general
sourness
gives
a
nice
dry
finish
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
very
nice
to
drink
im
a
sucker
for
big
flavorful
beers
and
this
one
satisfies
that
in
a
new
dimension
differently
than
the
big
ipas
and
stouts
thanks
russian
river
for
delivering
us
beers
to
expand
our
minds
and
tastes
d
very
nicely
done
as
expected
this
is
quite
reminiscent
of
orval
with
a
lighter
malt
body
and
more
citrus
character
the
aroma
has
quite
a
bit
of
earthy
funk
the
element
that
brings
orval
to
mind
while
the
wild
character
comes
out
more
as
a
lemony
tartness
in
the
flavor
profile
well
balanced
relatively
simple
and
absolutely
brilliant
it
certainly
wasnt
a
cheap
bottle
but
this
is
one
of
those
rare
beers
that
is
genuinely
a
bargain
at
any
price
o
i
have
heard
so
many
good
things
about
this
beer
and
i
was
not
let
down
incredibly
refreshing
and
delicious
excellent
tasting
sour
with
an
amazing
drinkability
o
such
a
nice
tart
beer
and
so
refreshing
a
nice
take
on
the
blonde
ale
not
the
most
sour
beer
but
a
nice
sour
to
get
your
mouth
wet
good
work
as
usual
russian
river
overall
a
great
example
of
a
rr
sour
there
are
better
but
i
think
this
one
is
not
as
mouth
puckeringly
sour
as
some
of
the
others
maybe
a
better
rr
sour
to
start
out
on
for
the
sour
beginner
or
faint
of
heart
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
look
to
acquire
more
bottles
whenever
i
can
very
refreshing
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
tartness
and
lively
carbonation
finishes
nice
and
dry
just
the
way
it
should
a
very
nice
beer
which
i
will
seek
out
again
this
is
an
interesting
sour
it
starts
off
as
a
normal
sour
but
then
turns
into
a
blonde
leaving
the
sourness
as
a
recent
memory
oimpressed
with
this
rr
sour
ill
be
buying
more
to
out
away
think
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
the
sour
and
barnyard
is
under
control
really
pleased
with
this
beer
just
wish
it
was
a
750ml
not
a
375ml
very
bright
and
flavorful
the
brett
seems
more
forward
in
the
bottle
vs
my
memory
of
the
ontap
version
while
overall
i
think
i
prefer
supplication
this
is
more
refreshing
russian
river
works
their
magic
again
overall
this
was
a
very
unique
beer
that
was
a
great
treat
i
would
never
want
to
have
one
every
day
but
it
certainly
spiced
up
my
normal
selection
of
brews
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
huge
4
inch
white
head
that
fades
into
a
chunky
small
cap
very
distinct
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
funkymusty
from
the
brett
with
some
sour
fruit
notes
as
well
taste
is
somewhat
fruity
all
around
with
green
apples
and
sour
citrus
fruits
in
harmony
with
the
funk
from
the
brett
a
good
level
of
carbonation
but
i
was
expecting
much
more
after
the
4
inch
head
on
the
initial
pour
beer
is
pretty
crisp
with
each
sip
but
leaves
a
stickiness
in
the
mouth
as
well
overall
this
is
a
solid
wild
ale
from
rr
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
others
in
my
opinion
o
get
some
of
this
beer
as
soon
as
you
can
i
generally
use
sours
for
pallet
cleansers
but
this
beer
as
well
as
many
other
russian
river
sours
might
slip
into
my
regular
rotations
although
this
review
is
for
batch
5
bottle
i
have
also
had
batch
4
bottle
and
both
of
them
on
draft
there
are
definitely
some
variations
between
batches
and
drafts
my
slight
preference
is
for
batch
4
but
batch
5
is
an
excellent
beer
that
should
age
well
arid
finish
with
notes
of
muscat
grape
braggs
vinegar
and
green
apple
mouthfeel
is
light
but
somewhat
creamy
and
complements
the
beer
well
this
is
a
fine
wild
ale
and
well
worth
your
money
finish
again
semi
dry
and
of
medium
length
sanctification
leaves
behind
traces
of
fruit
yeast
funk
and
earth
tones
layered
with
flavor
and
personality
this
beer
rocks
wish
i
could
rate
it
higher
but
there
are
too
many
of
the
finest
wild
ales
ever
made
against
which
it
competes
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
nice
perfect
body
and
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
just
not
too
exciting
overall
i
now
have
had
three
of
the
four
current
rr
sours
will
have
the
last
of
them
tomorrow
this
is
my
lowest
ranked
out
of
them
thusfar
i
am
not
one
to
eat
food
while
drinking
a
beer
in
general
but
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
pair
with
a
nice
seafood
dinner
much
much
more
subdued
than
the
other
sours
yet
still
very
enjoyable
o
this
was
pretty
solid
and
perhaps
a
nice
gateway
beer
to
sours
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
some
of
it
as
i
alluded
to
above
now
i
want
to
see
what
happens
with
the
supplication
consecration
and
temptation
as
they
sit
in
some
wine
barrels
interesting
stuff
pours
a
golden
pale
in
to
my
oversized
snifter
dissipating
head
but
continues
to
bubble
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
whole
time
smell
is
definitely
full
of
brett
some
sour
apples
and
grassy
funk
very
nice
taste
is
a
little
more
subtle
than
most
rr
sours
but
very
good
starts
off
a
little
bit
sweet
and
fruity
full
of
apple
and
lemon
tartness
finishes
dry
mildly
lactic
and
just
slightly
puckering
refreshing
beer
on
a
sunny
evening
great
stuff
mouthfeel
is
lively
bubbly
and
dry
overall
this
is
another
fantastic
offering
from
rr
not
sure
if
its
as
good
as
its
counterparts
like
supplication
temptation
and
consecration
but
id
gladly
take
one
of
these
anytime
im
new
to
sours
but
this
could
be
the
one
that
makes
me
a
believer
yet
again
a
very
enjoyable
brew
by
russian
river
popped
open
a
375
pours
a
2
finger
head
that
stays
golden
and
hazy
in
appearance
aromas
of
brett
right
away
apples
and
funk
the
taste
follows
the
nose
to
a
tee
only
strengthened
its
dry
but
not
too
dry
just
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
russian
river
knows
sours
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
overall
a
well
made
and
straight
forward
sour
beer
it
cuts
through
fatty
foods
nicely
if
youre
looking
for
a
pairing
the
beer
matched
the
spring
like
weather
here
in
pdx
overall
this
is
damn
good
this
was
the
first
100
brett
beer
ive
had
and
im
quite
impressed
im
very
much
looking
forward
to
the
other
russian
river
sours
waiting
in
the
fridge
overall
i
am
very
impressed
this
was
my
first
russian
river
sour
and
i
only
have
more
sour
bottles
than
this
in
the
cellar
i
cannot
wait
to
dig
into
those
soon
special
thanks
to
hurfer
for
providing
me
this
very
good
beer
i
could
say
this
was
a
learning
experience
sours
are
well
rated
on
ba
it
seems
they
fulfill
the
other
side
of
the
heavy
handed
craft
spectrum
its
sledge
hammer
hoppy
or
its
sour
either
way
its
bombastic
like
american
merlots
some
are
rich
in
flavor
and
some
have
holes
but
that
magnitude
of
the
process
is
undeniable
and
i
drink
this
feeling
that
that
is
whats
most
important
its
sour
its
not
a
lambic
period
overall
another
amazing
beer
from
rr
they
deserve
all
the
accolaids
they
recieve
as
they
make
amazing
beer
another
must
try
good
beer
id
drink
any
single
daybut
im
still
in
love
with
suplication
concecration
though
those
are
rrs
gems
im
my
eyes
o
this
was
a
really
good
beer
thing
is
at
this
price
id
think
youd
be
much
better
off
with
any
other
of
the
rr
sours
unless
you
want
something
subtler
i
dont
see
why
youd
pick
this
one
up
even
then
there
are
much
better
alternatives
for
less
money
still
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
a
great
beer
that
i
would
drink
more
of
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
i
do
like
some
of
the
other
russian
river
sour
beers
much
better
supplication
compunction
consecration
sanctification
is
not
as
complex
as
the
these
in
my
opinion
o
great
sour
from
rr
and
definitely
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
great
example
of
the
style
my
expectations
were
definitely
exceeded
after
finishing
this
one
wonderful
job
rr
an
excellent
offering
from
the
brewing
artists
at
rr
this
is
more
than
a
beer
this
is
an
amazing
beverage
o
love
this
sour
very
balanced
and
a
great
food
pairing
beer
not
too
sour
not
too
grassy
not
too
oaky
and
not
too
fruity
its
just
right
d
overall
this
is
an
amazing
sour
think
i
might
have
ruined
the
next
few
sours
i
try
by
trying
such
a
top
notch
one
first
but
seriously
i
want
to
buy
like
a
whole
case
so
i
can
enjoy
1
of
these
a
week
a
great
beer
overall
another
great
sour
from
russian
river
surprise
surprise
im
glad
this
made
its
way
to
philly
and
im
definitely
going
to
get
as
much
as
i
can
next
time
o
005
is
not
the
best
sanctification
ive
had
but
it
is
certainly
delicious
and
is
drinking
much
better
than
it
was
a
month
or
two
ago
pours
a
hazed
ppale
straw
color
as
expected
a
rush
of
bubbles
forms
a
pillowy
head
diminishes
quickly
but
leaves
sticky
rings
around
the
glass
scent
is
all
about
the
sour
and
funk
while
being
100
brett
i
would
expect
the
funk
to
dominate
but
it
is
there
in
perfect
amounts
while
letting
other
components
come
through
the
tart
and
sourness
is
welcome
considering
the
yeast
used
hints
of
musty
grain
complete
the
profile
first
sip
is
whats
expected
from
the
scent
great
blend
of
tart
and
sour
flavors
with
barnyard
funk
musty
wet
straw
and
a
kiss
of
riper
watery
fruit
medium
bodied
bubbly
carbonation
dry
and
slightly
puckering
a
nice
simply
constructed
beer
that
shows
the
quality
of
ingredients
and
crafstmenship
are
what
makes
a
great
beer
overall
another
good
sour
ale
from
russian
river
if
your
a
fan
of
the
true
sours
those
without
added
fruit
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sample
finish
is
remarkably
dry
and
crisp
high
carbonation
gives
a
mouthfeel
very
similar
to
dry
champagnes
im
really
enjoying
this
for
now
but
im
glad
it
is
a
small
format
bottle
750
ml
would
be
too
much
for
me
by
myself
sour
newbie
that
i
am
overall
its
decent
but
not
what
id
be
seeking
out
from
this
brewery
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
wild
ale
not
to
mention
an
all
brettanomyces
version
it
is
extremely
well
balanced
with
an
array
of
nuances
great
beer
cheers
overall
i
like
it
though
not
amongst
my
favorites
due
to
the
fact
that
i
have
nary
a
preference
for
lemons
sorry
if
there
were
just
a
tab
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
preference
would
steer
this
in
the
a
category
plus
its
undoubtedly
funky
and
smooth
though
not
necessarily
complex
i
would
knock
back
a
couple
per
serving
but
should
supplication
or
consecration
or
temptation
or
beautification
be
offered
in
its
stead
this
would
be
left
to
someone
else
d
this
was
a
great
wild
ale
with
lots
of
dry
tartness
and
and
sourness
not
much
funk
bitterness
or
sweetness
the
body
was
fitting
and
made
it
easier
to
drink
any
flatter
and
the
sourness
would
have
lasted
too
long
in
the
finish
this
really
pushes
the
tart
envelope
very
enjoyable
if
youre
into
wild
ales
definitely
recommended
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
wild
ale
here
not
as
in
your
face
sour
as
others
i
have
tried
but
this
makes
sanctification
that
much
easier
and
enjoyable
to
drink
pretty
solid
stuff
and
has
me
very
intrigued
to
try
more
rr
barrel
beers
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
clean
very
nice
overall
good
tasty
beer
o
very
nice
i
think
i
still
prefer
temptation
overall
but
i
really
liked
this
one
just
a
bit
too
strong
on
the
funk
at
the
moment
i
could
see
this
developing
beautifully
over
the
next
year
or
so
this
is
spectacular
highly
recommended
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
sour
but
not
at
the
same
level
of
the
other
russian
river
sours
i
have
had
reminded
me
of
a
solid
gueuze
i
would
get
this
again
if
i
had
the
chance
but
would
not
actively
seek
it
out
i
am
very
happy
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
all
in
all
a
great
beer
that
i
will
buy
everytime
i
see
it
on
the
shelves
these
russian
river
sours
really
have
grown
on
me
over
the
years
i
need
to
go
back
and
rereview
all
of
them
as
their
gradings
surely
will
have
improved
d
good
wild
offering
quite
tart
so
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
through
which
i
didnt
mind
375ml
bottle
courtesy
of
zestar
pours
cloudy
bright
yellow
with
white
head
realy
beautiful
aroma
is
funky
lemony
and
maybe
a
little
grassy
taste
is
tart
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
just
a
solid
offering
from
russian
river
overall
all
four
of
the
replacement
beers
have
been
deliciously
tasty
and
refreshing
this
is
what
vinnie
wanted
me
to
get
from
one
of
his
beers
overall
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
easily
drinkable
for
me
which
cannot
be
said
about
most
sours
i
had
a
hard
time
putting
the
glass
down
even
though
this
is
a
rare
treat
very
good
and
full
of
zesty
brett
goodness
as
this
is
a
100
brett
sour
spicy
and
tongue
grabbing
it
is
i
would
love
to
see
what
a
bottle
of
this
would
turn
out
like
in
a
55
deg
f
cooler
after
about
8
years
super
good
and
a
very
unique
sour
decent
stuff
but
not
russian
rivers
most
memorable
just
a
solid
crisp
sour
that
doesnt
try
to
show
off
ill
be
saving
my
other
bottle
for
a
nice
outside
summer
drinking

it
for

of
abv
nicely
balanced
very
crisp

dry
d
amazing
beer
the
balance
between
wild
yeast
and
earthy
brett

tropical
ripe

just
to
try
something
different

is
wonderful

the

thanks
again
o
this
is
a
killer
awa
dry
and
crisp
and
not
too
sour
very
refreshing
excellent
tate
is
very
tart
and
funky
super
sour
and
crisp
its
hard
to
believe
this
is
just
brett
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
sharp
with
good
carbonation
super
easy
drinking
phenomenal
mouthfeel
drinkability
sour
on
the
tongue
and
back
of
my
mouth
while
foamy
with
yeast
on
the
roof
a
medium
bodied
blonde
ale
that
packs
a
sour
punch
easily
drinkable
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
reminds
me
of
eating
a
cut
up
apple
soured
with
lemon
juice
poured
from
bottle
batch
005
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
nice
golden
orange
color
with
small
chunks
of
sediment
noticeable
and
a
nice
sustaining
thin
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
throughout
the
session
aroma
is
sour
but
not
as
much
as
some
of
the
other
rr
sours
and
is
more
nuanced
nose
is
also
picking
up
a
delicate
blend
of
raw
funky
brett
burlap
and
barnyard
hay
with
sour
acidic
fruit
notes
of
lemon
peel
apricot
and
peach
with
subtle
notes
of
vanilla
white
pepper
nutmeg
and
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
some
sour
citrusy
fruit
tones
that
evolve
as
the
beer
warms
plenty
of
funk
woody
grassy
and
somewhat
cheesy
medium
bodied
with
a
very
dry
finish
sour
but
not
mouth
puckeringly
so
like
supplication
or
consecration
flavor
essentially
mimics
aroma
with
alot
of
sour
fruit
tones
but
with
a
somewhat
floral
aspect
after
to
the
dry
finish
i
am
still
not
a
big
fan
of
sours
but
this
is
obviously
wellmade
from
rr
taste
is
great
straightforward
sour
similar
to
temptation
in
many
ways
although
a
little
less
complex
gets
the
salivary
glands
working
overtime
small
amount
of
white
wine
residual
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
seems
to
go
good
before
or
after
any
beer
light
in
body
relatively
high
in
sourness
no
real
discernable
fruit
feel
to
it
other
than
maybe
the
aforementioned
lemon
m
sourness
doesnt
linger
too
long
nice
bubbly
carb
feel
on
the
tongue
great
wild
ale
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sours
yet
but
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
i
found
it
sour
but
not
too
sour
i
think
this
is
very
balanced
considering
it
was
solely
fermented
with
brett
the
more
sip
on
it
and
the
more
it
sits
in
the
glass
the
better
it
gets
im
glad
a
bought
several
of
them
i
will
definitely
be
enjoying
these
in
the
months
to
come
drinkability
it
was
decently
refreshing
for
me
but
i
need
some
more
exploration
in
the
sours
department
one
at
a
time
seems
good
the
sourness
seems
a
little
less
multidimensional
than
some
of
russian
rivers
other
brews
but
this
one
was
still
plenty
enjoyable
what
a
flavor
wallop
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
have
no
trouble
drinking
a
few
of
these
although
the
extreme
tartness
may
turn
some
people
off
the
flavor
is
incredible
and
very
well
balanced
for
being
fermented
solely
with
brett
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
fall
in
love
with
it
d
not
all
that
exciting
basically
a
funky
beer
that
has
a
light
sweetness
to
it
some
nice
when
youre
looking
for
a
lightfunky
beer
but
i
usually
eitheror
not
both
drinkability
isnt
that
good
not
digging
this
one
at
all
russian
river
is
pretty
hit
or
miss
with
their
sours
depending
on
where
you
drink
them
in
their
evolution
and
judging
by
the
high
scores
i
obviously
should
have
given
this
brand
new
batch
more
time
the
problem
is
its
so
bad
im
not
sure
i
want
to
buy
another
one
just
to
see
if
it
improves
regardless
its
pretty
bad
right
now
i
want
my
10
back
d
ive
had
this
a
few
times
in
the
last
couple
weeks
and
it
just
keeps
getting
better
one
of
the
more
quafable
american
wild
ales
out
there
no
surprise
when
its
a
rr
brew
drinkability
my
wife
who
does
not
like
beer
tried
this
and
felt
as
if
it
was
a
general
exception
to
her
usual
rules
i
would
drink
this
every
day
if
it
were
an
option
d
very
crisp
and
refreshing
tons
of
flavor
a
really
good
batch
delightfully
drinkable
the
tartness
never
really
builds
and
makes
itself
unwelcome
drinkability
gets
high
marks
very
easy
on
the
palate
and
makes
this
expensive
beer
disappear
far
too
quickly
d
another
great
offering
from
russian
river
was
glad
to
see
what
they
could
do
using
only
brett
in
a
beer
would
love
to
see
how
this
tastes
with
a
more
intensely
developed
brett
flavor
nicely
done
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
expensive
stuff
but
definitely
worth
it
d
crisp
refreshing
and
relatively
moderate
abv
if
the
price
were
lower
this
would
make
a
nice
hot
summers
day
thirst
quencher
batch
4
is
far
less
impressive
and
would
be
in
the
3
7
range
the
pours
is
pretty
and
birght
golden
in
color
with
an
active
body
and
a
pure
white
fluffy
head
the
nose
is
brett
forward
slighlty
eggy
and
perfumey
juicy
citrus
and
lemon
peel
with
some
soft
golden
pears
the
taste
has
a
ton
more
juicy
vinous
flavors
and
brett
still
some
eggy
flavors
notes
of
spicy
yeast
white
graps
and
notes
of
citrus
and
ripe
mango
soft
creamy
feel
with
a
dry
finish
and
light
carbonation
overall
the
brett
in
this
is
overpowering
and
the
flavors
are
flabby
not
a
bad
wild
but
no
where
near
what
batch
3
is
not
usually
my
style
of
beer
and
the
tangy
funk
is
what
people
call
interesting
with
a
slight
pause
in
their
voice
despite
all
this
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
real
treat
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
more
of
these
cloudy
and
straw
colored
with
a
pure
white
foamy
head
little
lacing
typical
rr
wild
smell
but
tropical
fruits
are
more
prominent
in
this
one
very
puckering
upfront
in
the
taste
as
expected
but
goes
down
smoother
that
the
others
great
mouthfeel
very
lively
like
a
nice
champagne
very
drinkable
particularly
for
the
style
this
almost
seems
like
a
beginner
version
but
still
has
the
punch
that
a
more
experience
drinker
would
appreciate
d
this
is
a
easy
drinker
grab
a
few
if
you
can
you
are
going
to
need
them
d
another
excellent
beer
by
russian
river
i
was
jonesing
for
some
sourwild
ale
and
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
d
this
beer
was
good
not
very
attractive
i
found
myself
wanting
to
sip
this
down
so
i
can
move
on
i
could
drink
this
all
day
d
nice
one
could
have
a
few
overall
great
wild
ale
and
definitely
on
the
wild
side
of
this
category
as
opposed
to
the
sour
this
is
wonderful
for
a
wild
and
im
really
enjoying
it
its
not
as
good
as
supplication
or
consecration
but
better
than
temptation
imo
its
the
best
pure
brett
beer
ive
ever
tried
and
im
curious
what
age
would
do
to
this
wonderful
pours
a
clear
amber
golden
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
apparent
at
all
aroma
is
slightly
tart
but
still
a
little
to
sweet
it
seems
fruity
with
mild
acidic
character
fruity
and
acidic
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
finshes
very
clean
within
30
seconds
you
dont
remember
what
it
tastes
like
hints
of
white
wine
but
not
tart
it
sour
enough
for
me
mouthfeel
is
nearly
flat
with
minimal
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
want
to
this
is
a
delicious
drinker
even
for
a
sour
or
something
so
dry
this
is
a
beer
id
have
several
glasses
of
the
56
abv
keeps
you
honest
too
d
the
beer
is
definitely
refreshing
and
intriguing
so
i
prefer
to
take
a
bit
of
time
to
savor
it
if
you
do
have
the
financial
means
to
stock
your
cooler
with
this
by
all
means
have
a
blast
could
see
this
being
mighty
good
with
a
bit
of
chill
on
it
during
a
warm
spring
day
nice
beer
batch
005
i
shared
this
375ml
with
a
friend
sanctification
is
a
beer
that
i
have
been
waiting
for
a
long
time
to
try
this
beer
and
unfortunately
it
was
a
let
down
when
i
opened
and
poured
this
beer
it
was
definitely
very
funky
with
the
signature
brett
aroma
the
lightly
colored
beer
was
as
pale
and
effervescent
as
champagne
but
decidedly
cloudier
and
the
nose
revealed
little
more
than
brett
the
palette
was
similar
it
was
a
little
tart
lemony
some
mildewy
straw
but
that
was
about
it
though
it
was
good
it
didnt
have
as
much
complexity
as
i
was
anticipating
perhaps
this
beer
just
needs
some
more
time
it
was
easy
drinking
but
not
a
wow
beer
this
is
a
bit
of
an
old
school
sour
wild
ale
no
bells
and
whistles
or
unusual
barrelsfruits
just
a
good
solid
beer
with
pretty
much
no
flaws
sanctification
came
in
the
glass
looking
like
juice
of
sorts
a
light
gold
with
some
yelloworange
resembling
lemon
juice
a
nice
whisp
of
foamy
white
head
on
top
some
patches
of
stick
on
the
upper
reaches
of
the
glass
smell
is
pretty
tame
considering
its
rr
were
dealing
with
pretty
much
a
base
blond
beer
with
some
brett
scent
and
light
fruits
simple
yet
so
nice
a
very
light
sour
tastes
of
some
begian
yeast
i
believe
westmalle
earth
light
biscuit
banana
semi
tropics
sour
brett
which
is
more
funky
than
all
out
sour
at
this
point
some
nice
lemon
taste
on
the
backend
i
remember
this
being
a
bit
more
complex
out
of
a
batch
2
bottle
so
maybe
vinnie
tweaked
this
some
feel
is
light
bodied
and
very
refreshing
this
is
very
drinkable
beer
but
expensive
for
what
it
is
so
not
one
to
have
two
or
three
of
this
is
something
i
would
bring
to
a
picnic
with
a
girl
on
a
nice
sunny
day
d
nice
brew
if
you
like
the
huge
blonde
sours
excellent
as
always
from
rr
d
tart
grapefruit
taste
with
a
lively
carbonation
no
alcohol
presence
as
far
as
im
concerned
overall
another
kick
ass
wild
from
rr
the
brett
mixes
perfectly
with
the
sour
funk
so
if
you
are
not
a
brett
fan
this
one
might
not
be
for
you
i
am
looking
forward
to
cellaring
a
few
of
these
to
see
how
they
change
more
brett
flavor
maybe
i
bet
yes
great
great
beer
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
unfortunately
the
price
tag
would
hurt
it
in
this
category
this
was
a
really
well
put
together
beer
though
and
im
glad
i
traded
for
more
than
one
bottle
this
reminds
me
of
an
unblended
lambic
but
carbonated
strange
and
somewhat
of
an
acquired
taste
pretty
good
one
though
anyway
thanks
parkway
d
this
beer
is
delicious
and
a
good
example
of
an
awa
especially
good
for
novices
of
the
style
awesome
brew
hv
drink
is
pretty
damn
good
i
love
wild
ales
and
rr
has
another
hit
in
this
one
a
very
pleasant
and
tasty
beer
the
cpj
what
can
i
say
another
score
for
russian
river
i
held
the
high
expectation
of
being
blown
away
but
ill
settle
for
a
good
sour
anyday
maybe
this
is
a
beer
than
loses
some
of
its
character
in
a
keg
or
requires
a
larger
sampling
to
better
understand
this
beer
highly
effervescent
crisp
light
bodied
reminiscent
of
champagne
a
bit
more
viscous
sometimes
almost
creamy
yet
still
very
crisp
d
overall
not
my
favorite
wild
but
it
will
do
rr
has
much
better
offerings
than
this
pours
a
hazy
straw
with
a
silky
white
head
has
a
nice
funky
brett
presence
along
with
tart
citrus
and
sweet
malts
well
balanced
flavor
profile
medium
to
light
body
crisp
carbonation
great
session
beer
but
11
per
375ml
is
way
too
steep
for
a
nonbarrel
aged
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
i
say
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
the
lingering
aftertaste
makes
me
want
more
of
this
beauty
d
i
really
liked
this
one
and
felt
like
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
lots
of
funk
and
brett
in
the
nose
and
taste
i
loved
it
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
overall
another
amazing
sour
from
russian
river
get
this
one
for
sure
because
its
awesome
definitely
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
amazing
beer
this
could
be
a
go
to
beer
if
available
year
round
really
nice
effort
lighter
medium

tingly
carbonation
dry
and
refreshing
on

super
drinkable

level
of
sourness
but
not
really
lactic
or
overly
acidic
i
finished
my
glass
and
was
ready
for
another
right
afterward
another
incredible

ale

fairly

good
i
preferr
this
over
the
wine
inflected

that
russian
river
is
offering
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
would
make
a
great
gift
beer
not
crazy
about
this
batch
but
a
second
tier
russian

is
still
a
few
miles
ahead
of
most
other
american
choices
d
nonstop
d
in
your
face
with
brett
but
the
fruity
citrus
corrals
this
funk
and
plays
off
it
nicely
t
brett
ahoy
super
sour
as
in
punch
in
the
mouth
sour
theres
a
peppery
bite
that
goes
well
with
the
sourness
and
as
the
beer
warms
more
flavors
come
out
tart
green
apple
and
lemon
add
a
nice
element
to
this
one
another
great
sour
from
russian
river
d
i
think
this
is
very
drinkable
for
those
who
like
sours
this
is
quite
a
complex
beer
for
how
simple
it
is
im
glad
i
bought
many
of
these
although
im
not
a
huge
sour
fan
yet
i
think
this
is
a
good
starter
because
it
isnt
as
sour
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
i
shared
this
and
already
want
to
pop
the
one
im
about
to
cellar
grrr
ill
have
to
find
more
top
shelf
brew
p
s
i
found
plenty
more
and
am
happily
going
through
my
third
bottle
in
a
month
very
good
and
cheaper
than
their
barrel
aged
but
just
as
good
or
better
american
wilds
caveatjust
got
this
beer
in
the
mail
and
couldnt
wait
so
it
was
a
bit
cloudy
otherwise
its
a
great
straw
color
under
a
small
white
loose
head
that
leaves
only
faint
lacing
the
aroma
is
soft
and
subtle
bringing
some
citrus
pith
lemon
horse
blanket
wet
hay
and
fresh
cut
grass
even
though
i
know
this
is
100
brett
i
taste
some
coriander
and
citrus
peel
but
initially
it
is
all
sour
lemon
and
light
funky
goodness
as
i
drink
on
i
find
tropical
fruit
notes
like
pinapple
hanging
around
back
end
is
earthy
and
filled
with
grass
clippings
dry
dry
dry
too
much
to
polish
off
a
750
luckly
this
is
a
375
i
have
brewed
a
100
brett
beer
it
aint
easy
and
russian
river
makes
it
taste
like
a
walk
in
the
park
note
when
i
opened
this
bottle
the
cavs
promptly
cut
a
25
point
deficit
to
12
but
eventually
lost
by
15
there
is
only
so
much
you
can
do
russian
river
almost
sessionable
i
like
it
a
lot
not
quite
as
much
character
as
some
of
the
other
tions
but
very
good
and
highly
recommended
light
body
with
a
soft
carbonation
that
helps
lighten
the
beer
even
more
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
would
be
enjoyable
to
drink
any
time
of
year
either
to
quench
thirst
or
to
remind
you
of
better
times
when
in
the
cold
of
winter
drinkability
different
from
some
of
the
other
rr
staples
i
e
temp
cons
and
sup
but
pretty
drinkable
nonetheless
glad
i
picked
up
twelve
of
these
suckers
massive
thanks
to
thunderroad12
for
this
necessary
tick
on
my
rr
tion
quest
and
also
a
big
thanks
to
huhzubendah
for
letting
me
try
one
of
his
bottles
at
sexual
chocolate
11
batch
004
served
from
bottle
into
a
green
man
snifter
poured
a
hazy
golden
yelloworange
with
a
two
finger
bone
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
sour
apple
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
apple
tart
subtle
fruit
and
a
dry
funkiness
on
the
followthrough
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
nothing
short
of
excellent
everything
in
this
one
seemed
to
be
spoton
for
what
they
were
aiming
for
here
in
all
aspects
had
an
awesomely
balanced
flavor
and
great
aroma
going
on
here
i
have
yet
to
try
a
bad
russian
river
brew
as
of
now
and
this
one
is
no
exception
this
is
an
absolute
must
try
for
any
sourhead
out
there
and
is
definitely
worth
the
timeeffort
of
tracking
down
damn
these
smaller
bottles
are
cool
in
some
respects
but
not
when
you
run
out
of
beer
dexcellent
stuff
but
way
overhyped
calm
down
nerds
d
a
nice
drinking
wild
with
subtle
complexities
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
this
goes
down
well
and
pairs
nicely
with
a
host
of
cheese
appearance
is
run
of
the
mill
for
a
rr
sour
one
finger
head
with
decent
retention
no
lacing
and
hazy
yellow
this
smells
more
like
a
saison
and
less
like
a
sour
some
banana
funk
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
all
about
balance
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
which
for
the
style
is
not
exactly
what
im
looking
for
theres
some
lemon
but
also
some
banana
and
clove
as
was
said
by
another
ba
during
the
tasting
this
one
sort
of
tastes
like
a
saison
as
well
i
dont
feel
that
there
is
much
depth
to
this
the
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
by
the
one
dimensionality
of
this
brew
d
overall
i
though
this
beer
was
excellent
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
it
again
someday
pours
a
very
cloudy
pale
wheatapricot
color
with
no
head
mild
sour
aroma
the
taste
is
very
tart
sour
with
some
wheat
and
yeast
fruity
aromas
come
out
after
a
while
particularly
underripe
apricot
or
peach
no
citrus
at
all
in
the
flavor
and
not
as
yeasty
as
i
imagined
medium
bodied
and
generally
smooth
a
bit
like
a
wit
meets
a
sour
but
it
works
well
flavorful
yet
compelling
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
in
santa
rosa
pours
a
straw
yellow
colour
with
thin
white
head
nice
head
retention
and
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
sour
grapefruit
grapes
and
lemon
with
something
funky
i
think
this
is
brett
though
i
am
not
sure
if
i
actually
can
identify
this
flavour
or
not
quite
a
sour
flavour
very
dry
though
it
isnt
as
sour
as
some
beers
very
unique
flavour
too
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
id
love
to
have
it
again
d
another
world
class
sour
from
russian
river
heavy
on
the
brett
but
it
is
pulled
off
rather
well
definitely
one
of
their
more
unique
offerings
definitely
worth
seeking
out
d
compared
to
batch
004
brett
funk
is
not
nearly
as
inyourface
in
this
one
very
balanced
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
many
of
russian
rivers
other
wild
ales
slight
tartness
but
not
sour
due
to
the
100
brett
fermentation
this
is
definitely
solid
and
worth
a
try
but
its
a
different
animal
than
the
batch
004
thats
now
out
there
very
drinkable
one
of
the
most
drinkable
wilds
out
there
overall
good
i
had
this
on
tap
at
rr
and
it
was
far
better
imo
this
seems
to
be
lacking
some
of
the
complexity
ive
had
this
once
before
and
though
i
didnt
take
notes
i
think
this
has
improved
ever
so
slightly
souring
up
a
bit
i
anticipate
my
final
bottle
of
this
batch
bottle
batch
004
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
cloudy
orange
straw
color
with
a
slight
white
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
pretty
brett
with
a
very
floral
type
aroma
but
not
overly
so
in
a
bad
way
the
taste
is
fairly
smooth
with
a
strong
brett
floral
flavor
some
white
wine
like
notes
light
mouthfeel
the
lemon
and
sweetness
is
really
nice
in
this
beer
the
brett
flavors
really
do
a
nice
job
in
this
beer
overall
a
really
nice
sour
beer
for
rr
it
was
different
from
their
others
but
still
good
pretty
drinkable
i
was
a
fan
of
this
one
nice
classic
funk
in
the
taste
with
a
lesser
wheaty
saison
base
lemongrass
notes
are
prominent
but
theres
a
metallic
edge
that
isnt
great
to
it
sweet
as
well
the
mouth
is
good
overall
bright
on
the
palate
d
all
day
drinker
especially
in
the
hot
summer
months
overall
after
my
first
sniff
of
the
beer
i
knew
this
was
the
most
brettforward
beer
ive
had
from
rr
after
giving
it
a
few
sips
i
found
it
to
be
close
to
a
drier
and
more
brettforward
version
of
temptation
a
very
good
beer
thats
well
worth
a
shot
drinkability
very
sour
very
complex
and
very
enjoyable
get
some
thanks
again
jeff
always
appreciate
your
generosity
this
is
an
easy
drinker
another
solid
addition
to
the
russian
river
lineup
this
one
seems
more
sour
fresh
than
temptation
yet
i
still
prefer
temptation
to
this
beer
would
probably
pick
this
over
supplication
or
consecration
though
id
really
like
to
get
another
bottle
for
the
cellar
i
think
this
could
be
even
better
in
another
23
years
overall
the
beer
is
fantastic
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
beer
but
it
just
suits
me
when
i
had
read
vinnie
changed
the
recipe
a
lot
with
batch
004
i
was
extremely
worried
in
what
i
would
think
about
the
changes
it
is
different
than
it
was
its
less
sour
no
longer
mouth
puckering
i
would
argue
that
its
basically
the
same
beer
underneath
the
covers
but
the
complexity
has
gone
off
the
charts
the
downplayed
sourness
has
allowed
this
beer
to
speak
the
rest
of
its
mind
vinnie
was
leaning
more
towards
orval
with
this
batch
and
he
nailed
it
with
the
funk
but
added
the
tartness
and
more
tropical
flavors
underneath
an
absolute
masterpiece
i
cant
imagine
ever
coming
across
a
beer
that
rivals
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
gold
body
under
a
carefully
managed
one
finger
fizzy
white
head
moderate
visible
carbonation
the
nose
is
just
fullon
bretty
goodness
soft
maltiness
and
some
fruity
notes
quite
beautiful
in
its
simplicity
unique
slightly
biting
acidity
over
a
very
soft
doughy
light
malt
finishes
with
some
lemon
zest
pineapple
and
lots
of
cellar
funk
a
little
bit
of
lingering
pixie
stick
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
with
engaging
pinpiont
bursts
of
carbonation
a
really
great
beer
and
a
nice
showcase
for
all
that
is
great
about
brettanomyces
d
ive
avoided
reviewing
batch
4
because
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
it
when
it
warms
the
metallic
taste
fades
and
it
becomes
better
but
its
never
quite
right
to
me
i
dont
care
to
drink
this
too
much
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
super
drinkable
and
has
a
minor
puckering
quality
to
the
tongue
that
made
me
salivate
in
ancitipation
of
the
next
sip
had
on
tap
at
russian
river
nice
medium
golden
color
with
about
a
finger
of
head
smells
lightly
of
citrus
heavy
brett
some
tree
fruit
like
apple
and
pear
nice
fruity
flavors
dry
great
sour
bite
without
ripping
my
face
off
nice
mouthfilling
small
bubbles
dangerously
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
sours
ever
d
it
was
drinking
amazing
and
after
every
sip
it
i
was
fiending
for
more
russian
river
really
knows
how
to
brew
these
wild
ales
and
this
one
is
definitely
no
exception
im
really
glad
i
was
able
to
get
my
hands
on
one
cheers
d
i
wonder
if
ill
ever
get
to
try
this
brew
again
ill
sure
i
will
at
some
point
and
i
sure
hope
so
look
out
winemakers
theres
a
new
enemy
in
town
sanctification
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
not
wildly
complex
yet
hopefully
very
delicious
heres
hoping
it
can
develop
in
the
bottle
from
a
good
beer
to
a
great
beer
d
i
think
this
is
getting
the
rr
sour
benefit
here
its
good
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
i
like
temptation
much
better
much
more
funky
and
dry
than
batch
4
or
batch
5
the
dryness
was
especially
noticeable
this
is
definitely
the
best
batch
ive
had
and
its
almost
a
completely
different
beer
from
the
other
two
3
5
d
somewhat
boring
for
a
rr
wild
but
still
solid
d
well
only
a
slight
disappointment
good
beer
but
imho
not
quite
as
good
as
the
other
rr
sours
mouthfeel
really
starts
to
wear
and
tear
about
halfway
through
a
glass
thanks
auroracrisis
not
quite
as
complex
in
flavor
as
some
of
my
favorite
russian
river
beers
but
a
great
vehicle
to
showcase
what
brett
can
do
for
a
beer
this
has
to
be
some
of
the
best
stuff
going
in
the
american
wild
category
glad
to
have
had
the
change
to
try
it
batch
004
pours
an
almost
clear
very
bubbly
golden
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
clear
become
cloudy
when
i
get
lower
in
the
bottle
scent
immediately
once
corked
was
lemons
when
putting
my
nose
to
the
glass
i
get
light
funk
and
some
belgian
yeasts
then
i
get
a
bit
of
spice
along
with
some
grassy
lemon
scents
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
i
get
more
funkysour
notes
the
taste
is
very
lemony
with
a
definite
belgian
yeast
backbone
the
brett
is
very
noticeable
in
the
taste
i
get
some
very
sourtart
flavors
that
are
mouthpuckeringly
tasty
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
bit
of
a
pear
with
a
hint
of
oak
and
leather
taste
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
not
too
full
and
not
to
light
either
the
drinkability
is
fairly
high
especially
on
these
warm
summer
nights
d
extremely
drinkable
chuggable
even
im
glad
i
have
more
of
this
in
the
cellar
d
i
loved
it
i
would
drink
it
everyday
and
not
get
tired
of
it
the
only
brews
at
the
tasting
that
i
liked
better
were
beatification
and
ddg
consumed
8122010
d
was
impressed
with
how
balanced
it
is
its
not
puckeringly
sour
d
this
is
wild
ale
without
restraint
drinkable
but
challenging
after
tasting
the
previous
batch
of
this
beer
in
2009
it
is
apparent
that
the
2010
product
is
notably
changedit
is
far
more
sour
than
its
predecessor
as
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
experience
other
american
wild
ales
those
produced
by
russian
river
are
being
pushed
more
to
the
fringe
of
what
makes
the
style
appealingexactly
the
opposite
of
what
has
happened
to
their
pale
ales
in
my
estimation
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
quite
funky
again
leads
with
a
minimal
sweetness
followed
immediately
by
a
lactic
acid
almost
creaminess
and
a
moderate
leather
flavor
in
the
mid
to
late
palate
beer
is
not
especially
dry
only
moderately
i
wish
i
could
have
tasted
the
other
batches
that
were
not
100
brett
beers
but
as
far
as
an
american
wild
goes
this
one
was
quite
good
i
really
enjoy
this
not
over
the
top
sourness
or
alcohol
and
just
all
around
enjoyable
highly
recommended
great
mouthfeel
very
easy
and
tasty
for
me
to
drink
the
bottle
was
actually
gone
before
i
was
ready
for
it
to
be
j
d
i
had
to
keep
forcing
myself
to
put
the
glass
down
the
combination
of
refreshing
feel
and
great
enjoyment
is
a
dangerous
one
glad
ive
got
another
bottle
im
very
interested
to
see
where
this
is
in
six
months
to
a
year
a
totally
overrated
wild
and
with
so
many
other
russian
wilds
to
drink
this
is
not
one
worth
pursuing
i
just
returned
from
my
first
trip
to
northern
california
and
i
drank
so
many
good
beers
sanctification
was
easily
the
most
memorable
and
almost
surely
the
most
enjoyable
if
you
like
sours
this
is
a
musttry
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
not
the
sourest
of
sours
but
pleasant
overall
very
good
example
i
just
wish
we
had
given
it
more
time
to
fully
develop
skal
the
body
and
carbonation
levels
are
normal
good
for
the
style
drinkability
is
high
here
this
is
just
so
damn
refreshing
priceavailability
be
damned
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
yum
wow
loads
of
funk
citrus
and
as
it
warms
even
more
fruits
the
tartness
isnt
super
strong
but
definitely
there
mouthfeel
is
both
crisp
and
carbonated
yet
smooth
at
the
same
time
this
is
one
great
beer
that
meets
its
expectations
in
my
oppinion
atleast
so
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
drink
this
d
this
is
one
exceptionally
drinkable
wild
ale
sournesstartness
is
mild
very
fruity
and
complex
very
thirst
quenching
excellent
overall
highly
recommended
o
amazing
job
vinnie
wow
i
thought
this
was
all
hype
no
substance
but
i
was
wrong
this
beer
deserves
all
the
hype
it
got
was
an
okay
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
order
again
considering
all
the
other
amazing
things
i
can
order
at
rr
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
lemonyness
is
my
favorite
of
the
perceived
flavors
that
i
can
find
in
this
style
and
this
is
yet
another
of
the
stellar
sours
coming
out
of
russian
river
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
is
sour
lemons
with
a
lil
funk
apples
grapes
and
some
oak
taste
is
nice
and
sour
with
lemons
pears
brett
and
oak
dry
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
better
sours
i
have
had
batch
003
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
lemons
with
some
malt
notes
the
flavor
is
tart
lemons
with
some
yeast
and
brett
character
the
beer
is
not
too
acidic
and
is
very
dry
and
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
a
delicious
wild
ale
not
as
sour
as
i
expected
excellent
balance
another
great
rrb
beer
on
tap
at
russian
river
on
63009
pours
an
almost
opaque
yellow
with
beautiful
frothy
head
the
sour
lemon
and
grapefruit
almost
sting
the
nostrils
in
a
good
way
this
is
straight
up
sour
in
its
cleanest
form
the
brett
certainly
dominates
and
makes
this
a
truly
unique
beer
however
beyond
the
great
aromas
and
interesting
sourness
there
isnt
a
ton
of
complexity
of
flavors
still
a
great
beer
that
i
am
lucky
to
have
tried
overall
a
great
beer
i
dont
think
it
is
only
brett
there
is
more
sourness
going
on
it
was
great
with
the
salad
i
would
love
to
age
some
bottles
well
i
give
out
a
ratings
like
candy
on
halloween
it
seems
and
this
is
going
to
be
another
one
is
it
really
my
fault
that
i
drink
so
many
awesome
beers
i
will
drink
this
any
time
i
can
though
no
doubt
slightly
creamy
lactic
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
dry
bretty
funk
tart
and
puckering
without
being
acidic
at
all
very
dry
with
a
champagne
like
efervescence
in
the
finish
very
well
balanced
with
a
sweet
crisp
light
fruit
balancing
out
the
dry
tart
funk
lots
of
apple
and
pear
slight
vinous
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
long
into
the
finish
making
me
want
to
take
another
sip
immediately
highly
recommended
the
brett
funk
is
going
to
continue
to
develop
long
after
vinnie
says
on
the
label
i
may
try
and
trade
my
last
bottle
but
seriously
i
doubt
it
i
will
be
happy
to
do
a
tasting
with
my
homies
in
another
coupla
years
dtart
and
tasty
with
a
very
pleasant
green
apple
presence
i
am
diggin
this
one
one
of
my
favorites
has
some
nice
citrus
notes
quality
funk
feet
and
is
very
drinkable
as
far
as
the
acidity
not
ruining
the
experience
i
cellared
this
one
for
a
while
and
the
subtle
citrus
character
is
quite
a
bit
more
pronounced
as
well
as
much
more
mouth
feel
than
previously
i
thought
this
beer
had
a
nice
interplay
between
the
fruitiness
and
earthy
brettanomyces
characters
pours
a
bright
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
purewhite
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
brings
out
some
funkiness
and
sweetness
to
alongside
the
abundant
sourness
i
picked
up
quite
a
bit
of
lemon
in
the
nose
and
it
faded
nicely
into
the
taste
not
at
all
as
sour
as
some
of
the
other
stuff
we
had
at
russian
river
this
night
but
it
helped
to
enhance
the
drinkability
the
body
was
fairly
light
and
this
combined
with
the
lessthantotalmouthsourness
contributed
to
this
brews
high
enjoyability
d
drinks
very
easily
too
bad
its
impossible
to
get
thanks
vinnie
still
a
very
solid
offering
from
russian
river
i
actually
enjoyed
it
more
the
2nd
time
i
had
it
when
polishing
off
the
growler
i
recommend
not
drinking
your
batch
4
bottles
for
at
least
another
12
years
excellent
beer
its
too
bad
its
very
hard
to
come
by
well
this
beer
has
either
improved
a
good
bit
since
i
last
reviewed
it
3
years
ago
or
its
better
on
draft
had
this
at
the
rr
pub
pours
a
pale
golden
with
a
thin
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
thin
swirl
the
smell
is
sour
but
there
are
also
notes
of
wintergreen
lactic
aromas
some
earthy
hops
and
some
slight
barnyard
and
some
lemon
tastes
tangy
and
a
bit
sour
but
with
some
distinct
earthy
hops
and
some
funky
barnyard
tart
and
refreshing
with
some
lingering
bitterness
from
both
the
hops
and
the
barrel
drinkability
off
the
charts
for
a
wild
ale
this
one
disappears
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thin
wispy
head
that
falls
off
to
a
ring
leaving
little
lacing
this
looks
solid
the
nose
has
a
beautiful
melony
funk
mildly
earthy
a
little
dusty
nutty
almonds
honeydew
melon
a
tartness
reminiscent
of
meyer
lemons
the
palate
is
similarly
delightful
a
light
yogurty
lactic
tartness
a
clean
citrus
note
a
brightness
that
has
flavors
of
white
peach
cantaloupe
and
honeydew
melon
a
mild
brett
note
a
touch
of
clove
a
wisp
of
bandaid
are
also
present
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
soft
buttermilklike
lactic
tartness
along
with
a
touch
of
honey
this
is
exquisite
carbonation
is
moderate
lending
a
mild
carbonic
mineral
bite
beautifully
so
still
spectacular

d
a
wonderful
compliment
to
my
dinner
i
think
this
might
be
my
favorite
nonpliny
russian
river
brew
a
very
refreshing
complex
sweet
fruit
sour
bitter
beer
so
good
d
this
was
definitely
not
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
especially
given
the
100
brett
slogal
associated
with
this
wild
ale
however
i
found
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
and
not
too
overthetop
as
some
other
heavily
bretted
brews
too
bad
there
were
no
bottles
available
dodd
tasting
at
first
but
when
you
get
used
to
it
the
smoothie
flavor
its
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
smooth
velvety
and
effortless
with
an
effervescent
carbonation
throughout
this
beer
is
simply
amazingly
crafted
and
downright
delicious
i
would
drink
this
constantly
if
it
was
more
available
a
tart
funky
beauty
in
a
bottle
russian
river
knocks
it
way
out
of
the
park
once
again
sanctify
verb
to
entitle
to
reverence
or
respect
sanctification
and
russian
river
are
worthy
of
both
this
is
a
tremendous
american
wild
ale
that
deserve
to
be
brewed
again
and
again
if
youre
cellaring
a
bottle
its
drinking
great
right
now
quite
unlike
the
other
rr
sours
not
nearly
as
tart
with
more
earth
and
bready
components
infinitely
drinkable
a
fine
beer
even
if
it
doesnt
rely
compare
with
its
brethren
d
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
wish
was
more
readily
available
im
new
to
the
world
of
sours
at
this
point
but
i
like
where
things
are
going
d
the
sour
despite
its
boldness
is
very
approachable
the
booze
never
asserts
itself
and
the
range
of
flavor
that
emerges
from
this
simple
ale
is
exemplary
overall
another
solid
sour
from
russian
river
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
beer
on
a
daily
basis
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
sours
ive
had
as
the
tartness
and
funk
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
underlying
sweetness
a
great
beer
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
and
approachable
of
russian
rivers
wild
ales
due
to
the
beer
being
not
as
sour
as
some
of
their
others
really
enjoyed
this
one
another
solid
russian
river
i
was
not
expecting
to
be
floored
by
this
beer
the
initial
drink
sent
me
for
a
loop
but
as
i
drank
a
little
bit
more
the
complexities
and
pleasantness
of
the
taste
definitely
came
out
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
once
you
get
started
and
will
continue
throughout
one
of
the
more
accessible
sours
that
is
out
there
a
great
beer
that
i
would
like
to
see
reappear
in
bottles
draught
at
the
brewpub
5
67abv
light
straw
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
floral
and
quite
lemonytart
with
maybe
a
light
acetic
touch
the
flavor
is
sour
and
a
little
funky
with
some
lemon
leather
and
light
fruitiness
lighttomedium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
after
the
last
two
allbrett
beers
ive
had
proef
and
avery
i
wasnt
expecting
that
much
acidity
in
this
but
this
guy
is
pretty
damn
sour
with
great
leathery
funky
tastes
going
on
overall
easily
one
of
the
best
wild
ales
i
have
had
incredibly
drinkable
and
flavorful
d
sours
are
a
one
and
done
beer
for
me
very
tart
i
will
get
this
beer
as
my
first
beer
from
now
on
excellent
on
the
other
hand
the
flavor
is
more
on
the
punishing
side
with
a
sour
lemon
peel
dryness
balanced
by
lots
of
stinky
funk
imagine
james
brown
singing
with
a
mouthful
of
lemonheads
yeah
thats
about
right
body
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
puckering
dry
finish
of
wild
yeast
although
im
still
not
sold
on
the
whole
wildsour
experience
yet
i
can
appreciate
the
craft
with
which
sanctification
was
brewed
a
musttry
for
any
extreme
beer
lover
what
a
great
beer
the
balance
between
the
tartness
of
the
citrus
and
brett
was
fantastic
with
both
taking
equal
control
of
the
profile
giving
this
an
exquisitely
fresh
and
crisp
feel
great
drinkibility
on
this
as
well
i
killed
this
glass
in
no
time
flat
another
really
great
tasting
wild
ale
from
russian
river
a
fantastic
brew
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
my
favorite
brewery
seek
this
one
out
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
days
on
end
and
not
get
sick
of
it
it
was
one
of
two
at
r
r
that
did
that
but
the
other
was

this
was
great

poured
a
hazy
bright

with
a
billowy
white

thick

funky

and
citrus
lots
of
lemon
and
sugar
kind
of
like
lemonhead
candy
a
fruit
basket
of
other
aromas
apple
peaches
pineapple
its
all
there
taste
is
a
sweeter
sour
very
bretty
but
it
accents
the
peaches
and
pears
instead
of
overruning
them
wheatybready
flavors
in
the
background
enhance
the
tartness
its
unbelieveably
easy
to
drink
higher
carbonation
gives
a
pop
in
the
finish
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
freaking
expensive
light
bodied
very
dry
and
great
carbonation
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
sour
i
drank
a
growler
of
this
the
weekend
afterward
and
enjoyed
every

would
be
a

from

at

was
just
funk
and
brett
creamy
though
a
treat
to
try
this
brew
d
a
top
100
beer
and
i
was
anxious
to
try
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
but
very
tasty
and
worth
the
purchase
i
hope
to
get
a
bottle
someday
and
delve
into
it
more
d
so
good
probably
could
not
drink
more
than
a
snifter
at
a
time
i
was
really
curious
to
see
the
results
of
100
brett
and
in
the
hands
of
russian
river
this
is
definitely
impressive
highly
recommended
to
all
lovers
of
sours
another
great
wildsour
from
rr
flavorful
crisp
and
refreshing
supposedly
this
one
is
all
brett
and
it
really
shows
d
big
surprise
huh
another
wonderfully
delicious
beer
from
russian
river
i
love
the
sours
from
russian
river
and
this
one
is
very
drinkable
ill
be
sad
when
the
growler
is
empty
overall
i
had
this
one
on
tap
after
the
consecration
yesterday
and
that
was
a
mistake
the
consecration
affected
my
pallette
and
i
couldnt
fully
appreciate
this
one
my
wife
insisted
on
a
growler
and
now
i
have
come
to
see
this
beers
subtle
charm
this
one
is
a
winner
not
as
sour
as
i
expected
but
very
complex
drinkability
is
great
the
acidity
and
sourness
is
restrained
not
dominating
the
nice
funky
component
or
taking
away
from
the
drinkability
great
balance
overall
tasty
stuff
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy

some
clumpy

the
aroma
was
heavy
on
brett
earthiness
with
some
wet
straw
grass
and
funk
leading
the
way
it
also
smelled
of
a
sharp
tartness
that
had
an
edge
of
vinegar
and
lemon
flavour
was
tart
too
light
vinegar
character
and
a
bit
of
saltiness
it
was
juicy
too
with
a
fair
bit
of
berry
flavour
nicely
balanced
overall
with
the
sourness
kept
from
overpowering
the
beer
light
bodied
with
slightly
spritzy
carbonation
surprisingly
smooth
texture
really
quite
tasty
and
balanced
for
a
sour
beer
likely
due
to
the
brett

nice

us

was

of
the
perennial
favorite
barnyard
brett
brett
brett
the
taste
was
a
little
sour
with
a
bretty
pineapple
flavor
that
reminded
me
of
deproef

deux
brasseur
good
beer
not
as
sour
as
i
expected
but
easy
drinking
and
delicious
d
really
good
could
drink
for
a
long
time
d
fresh
pours
create
a
funky
brett
beer
that
reminded
me
of
the
flemish
primitive
series
but
disappeared
into
a
much
more
complex
beer
as
it
warmed
very
nice
without
being
a
lot
of
barnyard
found
in
other
brett

just
as
i
had
to
give
this
a
perfect
5
when
i
first
experienced
it
and
then
over
and
over
at
the
russian
river
brewpub
in
the
august
of
07
i
have
to
do
the
same
for
this
bottle
bactch
003
that
i
brought
back
from
that
same
trip
this
bottle
poured
a
beautiful
clear
golden
with
a
generous
white
head
the
smell
is
just
sour
also
a
bit
funkyearthy
as
it
warms
up
but
not
overwhelming
the
taste
i
cant
really
describe
as
anything
other
than
sour
but
its
just
so
good
to
me
this
is
my
favorite
sour
beer
of
all
time
at
least
so
far
t
ive
wanted
to
try
a
rr
wild
ale
since
i
first
logged
on
to
ba
big
big
thanks
to
johngalt1
for
the
chance
the
gentle
carbonation
makes
750ml
relativley
easy
to
drink
i
hope
i
get
the
chance
to
try
more
from
rr
as
this
was
outstanding
drinkability
easy
street
my
least
favorite
wild
ale
from
russian
river
so
far
but
that
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
to
say
this
is
a
very
well
done
funky
beer
d
if
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
find
i
could
drink
this
beer
very
often
again
i
think
it
tastes
like
a
braggot
for
those
interested
you
might
want
to
compare
this
brew
with
rabbits
foot
meadery
biere
de
miele
the
drinkability
here
is
pretty
good
shared
this
bottle
with
a
friend
and
he
hated
it
so
im
drinking
the
entire
750ml
bottle
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
excellent
and
more
then
deserving
of
the
rep
that
it
has
really
a
tight
ale
here
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
any
day
absolutly
superb
in
everyway
this
was
just
pure
quality
great
job
pours
a
semi
cloudy
yellowish
orange
color
with
a
very
short
lived
head
smell
is
tame
lightly
bretty
oaky
and
well
rounded
taste
is
oaky
dry
tart
and
a
light
but
sharp
and
pleasant
funkiness
to
the
malt
very
drinkable
and
remarkable
smooth
i
thought
great
beer
overall
this
is
one
nicely
balanced
funky
brew
it
is
not
over
the
top
like
some
wild
ales
i
have
tried
there
is
a
perfect
amount
of
funk
sourness
and
fruit
in
this
one
the
carbonation
is
perfect
and
oh
the
brett
i
loved
it
if
i
could
have
only
one
wild
ale
i
believe
this
just
may
be
the
one
mouthfeel
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
with
an
acidic
dry
finish
great
beer
overall
drank
this
a
couple
hours
after
redemption
and
it
blew
it
away
hope
i
see
this
more
after
russian
river
is
done
with
their
expansion
highly
recommonded
for
anybody
who
enjoys
wild
ales
the
beer
looks
like
most
others
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
but
finely
celled
foam
there
was
a
thin
layer
of
yeasty
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
and
taste
are
sour
very
nice
and
puckering
there
is
a
hint
of
sweet
maltiness
in
the
smell
but
mostly
this
disappears
from
the
flavor
as
the
brettanomyce
takes
over
another
excellent
russian
river
brew
drinkability
not
being
the
biggest
fan
of
brettanomyces
i
was
really
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
its
not
over
the
top
sour
but
just
enough
that
its
the
centerpiece
of
the
beer
not
the
whole
beer
theres
enough
going
on
around
it
to
keep
everything
in
check
great
beer
that
drinks
way
to
easy
taste
mouthfeel
initially
quite
sour
with
pronounced
flavors
of
lemons
bananas
and
granny
smith
apples
a
subtle
malty
sweetness
slowly
reveals
itself
mixing
with
the
puckering
sourness
to
create
a
surprisingly
balanced
flavor
light
bodied
perhaps
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
the
sweeter
flavors
come
out
more
and
more
in
the
finish
ultimately
leaving
a
faint
honeylike
flavor
on
the
palate
acidity
and
bitterness
are
fairly
low
exceptional
stuff
cheers
beertracker
this
is
a
solid
beer
although
theres
no
denying
its
not
quite
my
style
body
is
fluffy
and
expansive
with
carbonation
highly
drinkable
and
uniquely
thirstquenching
taste
is
very
fruity
and
and
sour
and
peppery
and
it
all
melds
together
to
an
almost
mellowness
peaches
unripened
apples
herbal
spicy
and
cheesy
wow
complex
with
so
many
subtleties
mouth
is
dry
dry
dry
sticky
medium
body
feisty
carbonation
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
one
that
i
could
honestly
drink
over
and
over
again
it
may
never
pass
my
lips
again
but
at
least
it
did
once
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
in
my
dt
tulip
it
was
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
from
little
bits
of
yeast
it
had
a
small
bubbly
head
that
quickly
went
away
a
little
carb
but
no
lacing
the
smell
was
brett
and
barnyard
as
others
have
mentioned
love
the
brett
aroma
but
i
like
the
smell
on
temptation
better
same
on
the
taste
very
brett
with
an
awesome
sour
bite
but
temptation
was
a
little
better
mouthfeel
was
great
with
the
sour
tearing
up
the
tongue
in
a
good
way
overall
another
great
beer
from
rr
and
highly
recommend
wish
i
could
get
a
steady
supply
of
this
one
whos
afraid
of
the
big
bad
bret
another
winner
from
russian
river
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweettart
soapy
oaky
and
fizzy
pours
a
hazy
pure
blonde
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
laces
sheets
as
it
dies
slow
smells
of
a
sour
wheat
and
almost
a
little
clove
and
some
spice
tartness
hits
the
tongue
first
thing
followed
by
a
fruity
finish
with
i
swear
some
clove
and
spice
medium
in
the
mouth
with
a
tickle
of
carbonation
sip
her
in
delight
tastes
like
the
best
kind
of
soda
pop
you
ever
did
let
past
your
mouth
very
firm
limejuice
sourness
mixed
with
an
incredibly
light
but
somehow
still
firm
burn
of
the
yeast
the
balance
is
so
amazing
that
even
though
its
not
hugely
complex
it
still
deserves
a
perfect
score
andwell
geez
i
cant
even
get
my
head
around
what
it
takes
to
craft
a
beer
as
wonderfully
unique
as
this
one
the
first
time
i
tried
this
was
feb
2005
my
latest
tasting
was
nov
2007
it
still
is
a
good
as
i
first
remembered
it
drinkability
awesome
brett
content
with
plenty
of
twang
and
earthy
flavors
very
highly
drinkable
like
many
other
beers
from
this
brewery
they
certainly
have
carved
out
a
big
niche
that
many
of
us
have
figured
out
and
have
become
festidious
followers
seek
it
out
cheers
i
enjoy
this
type
of
beer
anytime
and
this
was
no
exception
this
doesnt
have
the
sheer
puckering
tartness
nor
the
complexity
of
some
of
their
other
wild
ales
but
it
is
a
good
straightforward
sour
ale
worth
enjoying
time
and
time
again
blonde
with
a
short
lived
white
head
moderate
lacing
wonderfuly
aroma
of
funk
and
peppery
spice
hits
the
nose
immediately
taste
follows
suite
black
pepper
funky
tart
green
apples
and
underripe
pears
quite
tart
but
not
overwhelming
other
tastes
are
allowed
to
exert
themselves
mouthfeel
is
nice
especially
as
the
beer
is
allowed
to
warm
carbonation
is
not
too
prickly
a
problem
my
other
favorite
sour
brewer
jp
often
presents
drinkability
is
super
high
for
me
alcohol
is
not
noticable
and
the
level
of
tartness
is
perfect
ill
have
to
make
more
trips
out
west
for
this
baby
it
starts
off
good
with
a
slightly
cloudy
blond
body
topped
with
a
thinish
white
head
the
aroma
is
good
and
sour
and
have
some
apple
fairly
prominently
the
apple
caries
over
into
the
flavor
and
the
sour
is
good
but
not
too
intense
towards
the
back
of
the
palate
there
is
a
slightly
heavier
almost
dusty
sourness
that
reminds
me
of
orval
the
body
is
still
nice
and
light
and
i
would
love
this
to
be
my
standard
hot
weather
drink
thanks
beertruth
for
the
opportunity
might
be
a
bit
too
much
going
on
with
this
beer
the
sour
isnt
really
straightforward
and
the
yeast
is
a
bit
misplaced
the
fruit
component
also
seems
to
not
be
integrated
all
that
well
d
this
beer
is
sublimely
drinkable
i
could
drink
glass
after
glass
the
sour
taste
really
does
it
for
me
drinkability
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
i
could
go
for
this
again
and
again
and
can
see
picking
up
a
case
of
this
if
funds
permitted
i
never
buy
cases
but
this
one
would
be
a
rare
exception
i
like
it
pretty
much
perfect
sanctification
could
have
been
be
an
unblended
lambic
from
one
of
the
belgian
grandmasters
it
was
so
wonderful
that
i
drank
four
or
five
glasses
and
bought
half
a
case
on
the
spot
its
simply
that
good
appearance
wise
we
are
talking
about
a
very
pale
almost
white
golden
ale
body
with
a
healthy
white
lacing
the
aroma
is
powerful
previewing
sourness
and
boasting
of
perfectly
created
and
utilized
yeast
strains
and
lots
of
funky
living
organisms
barnyard
funk
rotten
lemon
peals
and
apple
vinegar
are
huge
the
nose
also
plays
at
tobacco
and
citrus
the
first
taste
is
pure
heaven
its
tart
in
a
lemony
way
sour
in
a
bretfunky
yeast
sort
of
way
slightly
bitter
in
a
hoppy
way
light
and
spritsy
sweet
very
ripened
grapefruit
that
has
been
eaten
away
at
just
a
touch
by
bacteria
hay
damp
corn
husks
rotten
melons
wood
roundedness
dashes
of
lemon
and
orange
zest
etc
bone
dry
and
fairly
light
body
musty
and
astringent
sourness
is
not
over
the
top
and
although
this
doesnt
enter
the
battery
acid
or
sweaty
donkey
hair
area
this
is
at
times
very
geuze
like
sessionable
indeed
pretty
much
perfect
very
nice
beer
good
that
an
experiment
in
100
brettanomyces
beer
holds
up
so
well
with
age
the
overall
balance
and
uniqueness
is
pretty
special
this
beer
was
masterfully
brewed
and
formulated
and
the
brett
did
an
amazing
job
of
creating
a
truly
unique
flavor
profile
a
great
puckering
finish
leaves
you
wanting
more
perfectly
carbonated
as
per
usual
with
rr
wild
ales
at
6
5
abv
this
is
batch
3
i
guess
the
ba
value
of
7
5
abv
is
for
previous
batches
this
is
very
drinkable
rrs
wild
selection
has
yet
to
falter
every
single
one
has
been
excellent
and
this
is
definitely
no
exception
its
been
a
few
months
since
i
last
had
temptation
but
i
think
sanctification
is
fairly
similar
a
great
wild
ale
and
another
fine
example
of
rrs
mastery
of
the
style
russian
river
does
it
yet
again
thin
mouthfeel
is
expected
from
the
high
levels
of
attenuation
that
wild
yeast
bring
to
the
table
lots
of
carbonation
very
nice
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
beer
enthusiast

this
beer
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
and
good
lacing
the
head
stuck
around
for
awhile
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
lemony
and
a
bit
sour
trademark
rr
brett
but
not
overly
sour
and
not
to
the
extent
of
beatification
the
taste
is
very
sour
as
i
was
hoping
for
and
has
a
nice
touch
of
citrus
that
leads
to
a
dry
finish
the
body
is
sort
of
light
but
has
active
carbonation
in
the
body
so
it
feels
bigger
overall
a
very
strong
and
tasty
beer
that
ranks
up
near
my
impression
of
beatification
but
just
slightly
lower
bottom
line
a
superb
american
wild
ale
in
my
book
my
hats
off
to
russian
river
for
once
again
travelling
down
the
off
the
beaten
track
750
ml
bottle
overall
another
major
step
forward
by
the
master
of
all
that
is
wild
to
american
ales
a
classic
haughty
but
very
well
educated
drinkability
an
experience
really
something
that
will
take
your
palette
to
a
new
level
if
youre
ready
to
move
into
the
double
black
diamond
territory
this
is
epic
genius
just
one
step
beyond
best
sour
ale
ever
i
plan
to
cellar
a
bottle
also
hoping
for
the
breadiness
to
even
out
and
allow
the
brettanomyces
to
evolve
to
the
next
level
excellent
work
notes
this
is
lambic
is
it
authentic
is
the
word
gueze
or
lambic
anywhere
on
the
bottle
no
yet
it
fits
squarely
within
the
style
i
just
started
drinking
true
gueze
a
few
months
ago
and
this
is
within
the
style
no
its
not
better
than
true
belgian
gueze
but
it
holds
its
own
worth
getting
for
the
price
alone
as
if
considered
lambic
this
is
the
greatest
bargin
ive
seen
for
the
style
hazy
orange
fairly
aromatic
not
very
funky
but
full
of
papaya
and
lemon
scents
light
doughy
malt
followed
by
an
overwhelming
sour
assault
notes
of
horseblanket
snake
skin
and
sour
lemons
light
and
bubbly
feel
on
the
palate
its
really
funny
that
this
beer
is
made
in
the
middle
of
sonoma
county
i
like
it
a
lot
a
very
nice
brew
finishes
long
and
drying
with
puckering
warmth
and
a
final
yeast
bite
beautiful

the
light

letting
the

have
your
attention
aromatic

dry

helps
to
bring

expansive

biting
it
feels

scene
masters
crowning
achievement
in
having
everything
well
displayed

unique
as
it
is
it
makes
for
a
nice
play
but
one
that
will
never
contend
being
the
best
of
your
life
a
nice
brew
classic
sparkling
summer
in
a
bottle
with
enough
funk
and
farmhouse
to
let
you
know
its
there
but
not
enough
to
scare
away
the
casual
belgie
fan
solid
stuff
thanks
to
the
fellas
who
know

they
are
that
treated
me
to
this
at
ujs
glad
i
had
it

i
like
brett
and
the
taste
but
this
one
was
so
overwhelming
with
the
brett
it
was
hard
to
discern
anything
else
going
on
underlying
blonde
ale
gets
overwhelmed
not
nearly
as
good
as
orval
but
nice
and
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
was
most
excellent
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
were
it
available
here

the

with

hitting
the

up

followed
by
all
of
the
funky
brett
notes
and
some
bready

as
well
there
are
also
some
fresh
herbalmedicinalleafy
orvallike
belgian
hop
flavors
midpalatte
as
well
mouthfeel
is
fluffy
on
the

light
and
super
refreshing

this
makes
the
drinkability
insanely
good

all
the

put
this
in

much
thanks
to

the
taste
is
light
and
spritzy
up
front
with
a
sharp
lemony
acidity
that
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
that
almost
tastes
artificial
in
nature
this
beer
foams
quite
a
bit
on
the
tongue
as
it
goes
down
the
finish
is
slightly
funky
though
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
the
finish
is
slightly
earthy
with
a
musty
cellar
note
this
beer
really
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
it
is
almost
as
if
a
lemon
has
been
added
to
my
duvel
glass
while
i
really
am
enjoying
this
beer
i
am
starting
to
think
that
brettanomyces
is
better
employed
as
a
supporting
cast
member
in
beer
granted
i
have
only
had
two
of
these
100
brett
beers
but
as
the
beer
gets
older
than
a
couple
of
months
the
beer
needs
some
more
complexity
that
would
be
supplied
by
a
funky
belgian
yeast
drinkability
a
very
good
and
drinkable
beer
that
is
welcome
in
my
mouth
anytime
vinnie
described
it
as
a
sour
blonde
belgian
ale
it
is
primarily
fermented
with
100
brettanomyces
and
bottle
conditioned
to
create
lush
carbonation
it
may
not
fall
perfectly
into
a
bjcp
guideline
other
than
belgian
specialty
of
course
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
ales
on
the
planet
i
kind
of
see
it
as
an
american
made
belgian
equivalent
to
a
german
berliner
weisse
but
thats
just
my
own
take
on
it
whatever
you
call
it
this
ale
is
good
good
good
i
sampled
this
at
the
wethop
tasting
at
rfds
in
washington
d
c
this
came
out
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
decent
bit
of
head
to
it
that
left
some
lace
aroma
was
fruity
and
had
a
little
spice
and
sweetness
to
it
taste
was
similar
with
various
fruity
flavors
over
a
layer
of
sweetness
and
spiciness
there
was
a
nice
tartness
to
it
as
well
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
light
and
drinkability
was
ok
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
i
would
try
again
i
gather
that
this
one
was
a
bit
of
an
experiment
from
the
brewer
while
not
outstanding
i
would
say
that
the
result
was
a
pretty
good
beer
muddy
rose
in
color
amberpink
with
a
thin
white
head
and
clumps
of
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
glass
even
with
a
fairly
careful
pour
it
has
the
awesome
tangy
aroma
youd
expect
from
the
style
with
sour
apple
notes
and
other
subtle
fruity
notes
including
cherry
and
plum
tartness
and
the
fruit
alike
continue
over
into
the
taste
but
theres
more
sweetness
and
blended
smoothness
than
many
other
sours
theres
some
carbonation
and
syrup
in
the
mouthfeel
but
it
comes
off
lighter
than
many
of
its
peers
its
a
great
beer

this
might
just
be
my
favorite
sour
by
rr
this
sour
solder
is
orangeamber
in
color
with
a
small
head
the
old
cake
whole
is
inundated
with
tart
and
sour
cherries
light
fruit
oak
funk
and
brett
another
great
offering
from
russian
river
thanks
to
my
buddy
zach
for
tracking
this
one
down
a
nearly
flawless
beer
one
of
the
sours
i
judge
all
others
against
darker
brew
than
i
thought
pinot
barrel
really
came
through
opened
my
eyes
to
the
wonderful
world
of
sours
my
favorite
sour
beer
smooth
with
tartness
think
sour
cherries
its
as
good
as
advertised
probably
my
favorite
sour
beers
overall
this
is
a
an
excellent
brew
would
love
it
if
this
was
easier
to
get
though
that
might
not
be
good
for
my
wallet
love
this
beer
sour
cherries
round
it
out
nicely
not
quite
as
amazing
as
consecration
but
what
is
takes
over
the
title
of
champagne
of
beers
a
delicious
sour
look
beautiful
copper
smell
of
cherries
and
pinot
noir
taste
of
cherries
and
delicious
sours
a
very
pricey
beer
but
worth
it
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
tasted
i
love
sours
this
is
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
o
beautiful
to
look
at
inviting
aroma
complex
flavors
that
unfold
slowly
but
never
fight
for
their
place
as
they
move
across
the
palate
all
while
remaining
smooth
and
silky
the
best
sour
for
me
thus
far
has
an
unusual
sweet
taste
for
a
sour
beer
based
on
its
malt
and
ripe
fruit
foundation
accompanied
by
matured
wine
soaked
chunks
of
wood
topped
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
lactic
sourness
rises
from
the
fruitiness
giving
the
cherries
a
powerful
pleasant
character
hovering
above
musty
malts
and
oak
acidity
then
blends
outstandingly
well
into
the
cherry
flavor
adding
a
vinous
note
to
it
without
becoming
too
sour
accentuating
the
rich
fruitiness
balanced
by
the
earth
and
leather
the
beer
finishes
pleasantly
dry
nontheless
supported
by
a
vivid
carbonation
with
cherryskin
toasty
stone
fruit
pits
a
vinous
tang
and
tooth
quenching
sourness
still
leaving
enough
space
for
rejuvenating
cherry
qualities
one
of
the
best
sours
around
best
sour
ive
ever
had
great
sour
vicious
tart
with
lively
co2
nothing
disappoints
from
this
brewery
awesomeness
this
is
asgood
as
discussed
by
my
piers
here
absolute
home
run
for
delivering
the
flavor
it
advertises
and
with
clarity
and
mouthfeel
being
spoton
a
top
sour
that
you
must
try
drinkability
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
sours
but
this
is
an
exceptional
one
to
me
this
is
the
bombest
sour
ever
sharp
acidity
hits
first
bam
then
an
incredible
sourness
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
bam
second
sip
is
better
as
the
mouth
adjusts
subtly
cherry
comes
out
sour
cherry
white
grapes
lots
of
funk
overall
as
i
said
before
this
is
a
perfect
beer
in
every
way
i
am
truly
surprised
i
want
more
and
hope
i
can
obtain
many
more
i
have
to
be
able
to
share
this
one
with
friends
its
too
good
to
have
all
to
myself
thanks
man
for
the
trade
truly
incredible
experience
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
but
this
one
was
pretty
tasty
maybe
my
least
favorite
of
their
outstanding
sours
much
better
in
bottle
then
on
tap
one
of
my
most
favorite
sours
awesome
flavor
my
buddy
came
back
from
cali
with
a
3
litre
bottle
of
this
from
the
brewpup
it
was
a
celebration
to
have
this
beer
in
the
midwest
good
sour
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
popping
the
cork
on
such
a
large
bottle
it
felt
like
being
in
the
winner
circle
after
an
f1
race
win
supplication
11
o
a
great
sour
im
not
the
biggest
sour
fan
but
i
enjoyed
this
wasnt
too
puckering
im
not
a
big
fan
of
sours
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
friends
that
tried
that
like
sours
say
this
was
a
very
good
one
complex
sour
delicious
the
cherry
note
stands
out
but
does
not
diminish
the
rest
of
the
flavors
a
very
balanced
and
flavorful
sour
beer
o
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
ive
ever
experienced
im
glad
i
did
as
this
style
is
not
in
my
wheel
house
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
get
your
hands
on
this
it
is
def
worth
a
try
batch
009
i
have
had
belgian
sours
i
have
had
cantillon
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
poor
imitation
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
thank
god
one
of
the
smoother
sours
ive
had
really
well
done
unsurprisingly
a
really
wellexecuted
effort
by
russian
river
and
just
the
sort
of
sour
even
those
who
arent
sour
fans
would
love
meanwhile
as
an
inveterate
sour
fan
i
wouldve
loved
to
consume
a
lot
more
than
the
approximately
sixounce
servings
poured
at
toronados
bar
another
excellent
sour
by
russian
river
supplication
easily
stands
out
as
among
the
best
the
us
has
to
offer
in
the
style
o
a
great
beer
but
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
that
is
on
me
and
not
russian
river
though
one
of
my
favorites
from
rr
just
wish
i
could
get
it
more
often
great
sourness
and
awesome
cherry
levels
just
cant
get
enough
of
it
mouthfeel
has
nicely
contrasting
dry
sticky
sour
and
crisp
characteristics
to
it
moderate
to
high
carbonation
i
just
experienced
all
day
happy
hour
at
russian
river
last
sunday
this
was
my
first
and
last
beer
of
the
day
great
beer
sour
wine
barrel
delicious
great
tartness
not
overwhelming
not
overly
acidic
amazing
sour
amazing
brewery
o
simply
put
this
beer
is
incredible
assertive
sourness
with
straightforward
yet
nuanced
flavors
care
craftsmanship
intelligence
and
quality
has
gone
into
this
and
the
result
is
one
of
the
best
beers
in
any
category
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
it
medium
body
and
medium
to
above
on
the
carbonation
i
cant
say
i
agree
with
the
consensus
that
this
is
the
best
sour
from
russian
river
it
is
very
very
good
but
i
would
rate
consecration
temptation
and
sanctification
all
above
this
one
o
enjoyable
charming
but
not
revelatory
still
its
piqued
my
interest
for
rrs
other
wine
barrel
ales
o

this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
what
fruited
sours
can
be
it
carefully
walks
the
line
between
funk
sour
fruit
and
sweet
with
no
single
element
dominating
while
super
drinkable
there
are
enough
of
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
to
keep
things
lively
my
favorite
rr
sour
to
date
so
good
plenty
tart
but
with
tons
of
depth
loved
the
cherries
definitely
a
world
class
sour
a
nice
balance
of
horse
blanket
funk
sweetness
from
the
cherries
dryness
from
the
pinor
noir
and
sourness
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
i
wish
i
had
several
more
so
i
could
age
a
few
in
the
cellar
ooverall
a
great
beer
had
to
get
back
in
the
long
line
to
get
another
rerating
this
because
the
first
time
i
had
it
was
only
a
3
oz
pour
managed
to
enjoy
a
whole
bottle
with
a
buddy
this
beer
is
the
closest
thing
to
perfect
you
can
get
the
smoothest
and
tastiest
sour
ive
ever
had
o
freaking
fantastic
need
to
find
more
bottles
for
my
cellar
this
beer
boarders
on
perfection
enjoy
it
o
i
dont
think
ive
ever
taken
smaller
sips
of
a
beer
trying
to
savor
every
last
bit
this
is
fantastic
in
its
complexity
and
also
very
refreshing
wonderful
beer
o
excellent
sour
ale
from
russian
river
the
flavor
and
aroma
come
together
extremely
well
d
exemplary
to
the
style
with
layers
of
great
flavor
going
on
and
a
very
controlled
amount
of
funkiness
rrbc
has
such
great
balance
in
their
brews
while
still
delivering
brilliant
flavors
i
found
the
consecration
to
be
a
bit
bolder
but
i
can
see
supp
as
much
easier
to
drink
and
therefore
held
in
higher
regard
surely
recommended
for
those
looking
for
a
great
wild
o
amazing
beer
love
the
cherry
and
pinot
flavors
i
need
more
of
this
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
regardless
of
style
its
so
inviting
and
just
full
of
all
the
favorite
flavors
i
like
in
wine
a
freaken
winner
and
i
would
buy
this
everytime
i
see
it
ruby
red
over
brownish
hues
with
a
tan
head
that
goes
quickly
minimal
lacing
with
big
sediment
at
the
bottom
tart
cherries
pinot
noir
wine
and
oak
notes
in
the
nose
big
tart
cherry
flavor
supported
by
wine
like
qualities
cloaked
in
oaky
notes
in
the
background
tartness
is
cut
toward
the
end
by
the
malt
backbone
making
it
sour
and
funky
but
reeling
it
in
before
it
gets
too
far
out
of
line
puckering
and
tart
with
vibrant
carbonation
and
a
bone
dry
finish
a
sipper
for
sure
and
a
fantastically
different
beer
o
excellent
overall
an
outstanding
awa
from
russian
river
nice
juicy
almost
kriek
like
cherries
and
acetic
short
sharp
shock
with
lost
of
remaining
wine
from
the
barrels
in
the
middle
the
musky
jock
strap
brett
on
the
way
down
and
the
lactic
acid
tang
complete
the
package
really
an
outstanding
sour
ale
from
russian
river
o
this
seems
to
be
consecrations
little
brother
a
little
lighter
a
little
lower
abv
a
little
less
tangy
but
a
very
great
beer
pours
pretty
dark
brown
aggressive
pour
gives
about
1
finger
of
head
that
is
reduced
to
a
film
in
under
a
minute
but
maintains
around
edges
of
glass
smell
is
tart
cherry
and
some
woodiness
taste
is
sour
cherry
cranberry
some
grassy
funk
definite
barrel
notes
as
it
warms
some
bready
malts
appear
pretty
full
bodied
in
my
opinion
tons
of
carbonation
maybe
too
much
for
me
sourness
really
sticks
around
for
a
while
on
the
palate
overall
one
of
my
favorite
sours
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
some
recently
so
i
could
put
up
a
review
on
this
great
beer
from
rr
o
another
home
run
by
russian
river
best
sour
ive
had
thus
far
this
beer
drinks
like
a
pinot
noir
lambic
and
sour
brown
ale
simulataneously
o
very
very
solidand
truly
unique
i
prefer
consecration
over
this
one
but
would
never
turn
it
down
definitely
one
of
a
kind
right
tell
you
why
i
like
the
beer
its
simply
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
barrel
aged
sour
beer
that
exists
the
flavor
is
slightly
fruity
puckery
and
has
these
amazing
layers
that
just
keep
coming
its
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
ever
had
i
disconnected
my
analytical
beer
drinking
side
sat
and
sipped
thinking
oh
god
over
and
over
not
many
beers
allow
me
to
do
that
smell
whiffs
away
stunningly
with
a
depth
of
taste
and
crispness
strongly
recommended
on
tap
which
is
rare
but
another
level
of
effervesce
and
taste
pours
a
dark
beer
with
a
reddish
tint
little
bit
of
bubbles
smell
is
glorious
typical
sour
taste
is
very
good
i
thought
that
i
couldnt
drink
this
by
myself
but
i
totally
can
it
is
not
overly
sour
that
makes
your
stomach
burn
it
is
well
balanced
some
traces
of
grapes
what
a
great
beer
with
a
medium
rare
steak
made
me
feel
as
if
i
was
drinking
a
50
bottle
of
wine
oak
aged
great
bitterness
just
super
well
rounded
what
a
treat
just
wish
i
could
get
this
regularly
wife
was
super
impressed
and
asked
why
we
cant
get
this
here
russian
river
beers
are
top
of
the
line
this
is
among
the
best
sours
ive
encountered
not
overwhelming
tart
delicious
cherry
and
pinot
noir
accents
poured
a
rich
semicloudy
orangebrown
with
two
and
a
half
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
that
receded
very
slowly
no
lacing
a
very
nice
looking
sour
scents
of
sour
brett
yeast
oak
sour
cherries
tart
wild
yeast
funk
hints
of
lemon
juice
and
a
bit
of
overripe
stone
fruit
in
the
background
a
very
nice
aroma
rich
funky
wild
and
complex
with
a
nice
fruity
character
present
as
well
flavor
begins
very
sour
with
notes
of
sour
cherry
and
hints
of
cranberry
and
red
wine
this
moves
into
further
sour
flavors
of
cranberry
raspberry
and
cherry
with
notes
of
oak
and
red
winelike
tannins
finish
continues
to
be
quite
tart
and
dry
with
more

but
after
the

it
has
a
depth
and

to
it
with

an

o
a
great
beer
for
sure
but
my
expectations
where
a
little
high
and
was
slightly
let
down
dont
get
me
wrong
its
an
amazing
brew
and
definitely
a
must
have
by
rr
but
maybe
ill
give
it
another
shot
with
some
age
o
my
first
time
trying
supplication
and
i
really
wanted
to
try
it
fresh
not
sure
how
it
will
age
but
the
cherries
just
come
blasting
through
from
my
limited
experience
this
doesnt
quite
drink
like
a
traditional
kriek
it
seemingly
has
its
own
identity
that
simply
relies
on
cherries
as
well
as
the
funky
bacteria
oak
pinot
so
distinct
and
special
ovearall
epic
one
of
the
beast
sours
in
the
world
if
you
have
never
had
this
beer
get
it

very

a

sipper
given
the
tart

fizzy
nature
this
beer
brings
together
traits
from
so
many
delicious
beverages
tart
sparkling
cider
champagne
red
wine
and
marries
them
with
a
beer
base
to
great
effect
not
quite
a
luxurious
as
the
bruerys
oude
tart
but
somehow
more
unique
and
refreshing
i
love
this
beer
i
dont
live
in
the
area
so
i
cant
do
a
proper
review
of
this
beer
but
i
just
want
to
add
the
praise
that
this
beer
deserves
it
is
so
good
i
will
drive
out
of
my
way
to
visit
the
brew
pub
in
santa
rosa
the
russian
river
beers
are
outstanding
and
this
is
no
exception
overall
pretty
much
the
best
sour
beer
i
have
had
the
appearance
is
nothing
to
behold
but
the
balance
in
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
is
something
to
behold
while
many
sours
may
pound
you
with
severe
dryness
achieving
great
flavor
but
with
severe
detriment
to
your
palate
over
the
course
of
consumption
this
ale
strikes
a
perfect
balance
never
going
to
far
either
way
it
utilizes
a
myriad
of
flavors
from
many
parts
of
the
process
and
creates
one
hell
of
a
flavorful
beer
this
beer
absolutely
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
4
75
a
little
overhyped
nothing
like
anything
else
ive
tried
though
a
true
unique
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
smooth
even
with
the
tartness
but
its
one
of
those
for
me
that
may
have
been
overhyped
the
degree
of
sourness
lessens
over
time
and
it
loses
some
of
its
luster
its
still
delicious
this
is
an
amazing
beer
no
doubt
about
it
there
are
a
number
of
flavors
that
intertwine
and
last
forever
helped
along
by
perfect
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
down
easy
yet
it
has
so
much
going
on
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
has
a
little
too
much
pinot
grape
influence
for
my
taste
i
wish
the
cherries
had
shown
through
more
than
the
grape
did
nevertheless
i
still
love
this
beer
and
highly
recommend
it
great
look
upon
first
pour
a
dark
amberred
i
am
a
newbie
when
it
comes
to
wild
ales
aged
with
sour
cherries
in
pinot
noir
bottles
however
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
drank
this
beer
and
it
is
pretty
damn
good
especially
becuase
i
prefer
ipas
and
stouts
aroma
is
sour
pinot
noir
funk
and
cherries
taste
is
might
good
with
some
sour
pinot
yeast
cherries
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
quite
delicious
and
well
balanced
new
style
for
me
really
havent
had
many
sour
beers
this
thing
really
spoke
to
me
lot
of
sour
cherry
aroma
had
sort
of
a
funky
note
but
it
wasnt
offensive
it
wasnt
a
particularly
fruity
or
tart
smelling
beer
only
had
a
6
oz
glass
and
wanted
t
much
more
ontap
at
city
beer
store
sf
had
many
times
before
ontap
and
bottle
far
and
away
my
favorite
rr
sour
supplication
pours
a
dark
opaque
red
there
is
minimal
carbonation
and
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
strong
mainly
sour
cherries
but
the
red
wine
barrel
is
there
too
the
taste
is
brilliant
such
well
balanced
fruit
and
tartness
despite
the
tartness
i
could
and
have
drink
this
beer
several
times
over
as
i
said
definitely
my
favorite
rr
sour
my
favorite
american
wild
and
certainly
in
my
top
5
of
any
beer
o
i
am
not
an
expert
on
this
style
but
i
dont
know
how
this
could
be
better
this
is
why
rr
is
on
that
elite
level
and
this
is
why
american
craft
can
accomplish
anything
when
craftsmen
brew
this
quality
of
beer
just
a
wow
moment
drinking
this
one
this
is
a
world
class
beer
bottle
from
the
brewpub
itself
dated
1714
pours
a
dark
red
color
somewhat
opaque
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
on
top
aroma
of
sour
cherries
vinegar
vinous
grape
notes
very
nice
flavor
is
a
medley
of
sour
cherries
and
vinegar
first
but
with
some
beautiful
oak
and
vinous
notes
that
give
this
a
huge
punch
of
flavor
and
depth
lots
of
bretty
funk
and
big
lacto
bite
the
wine
notes
continue
to
emerge
as
it
warms
some
nice
sweetness
that
balances
out
the
sour
beautifully
full
bodied
for
a
sour
brew
with
lots
of
carbonation
a
top
rated
beer
for
good
reason
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
truly
exceptional
among
sour
beers
maybe
not
quite
rodenbach
grand
cru
but
then
again
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
more
readily
than
that
undoubtedly
top
tier
all
i
have
to
say
is
those
cherries
awesome
beer
the
sweetsour
tartness
this
beer
delivers
from
the
interplay
of
pinot
and
cherry
is
something
that
remains
within
my
palate
memory
as
a
top
5
all
time
beer
flavor
thats
not
even
mentioning
the
beautiful
appearance
the
light
rose
fluffy
2
finger
head
and
hazy
reddish
amber
beer
hue
great
beer
very
complex
both
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
the
aroma
is
cherry
with
some
brett
spiciness
that
is
much
more
subdued
in
the
flavor
of
the
beer
the
beer
had
lots
of
carbonation
but
not
as
much
as
champagne
the
beer
was
dry
with
some
sweetness
and
lots
of
fruit
flavor
with
cherry
being
the
dominant
fruit
flavor
the
beer
was
sour
but
it
was
not
overwhelming
the
beer
finishes
tart
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
beer
had
a
ruby
red
caramel
color
to
it
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
superb
love
this
part
of
a
special
barrel
week
at
the
beer
junction
4
for
a
4oz
pour
7
abv
rich
redcopper
color
tremendous
lace
sticking
to
the
glass
aroma
was
a
bit
sour
and
unfortunately
i
think
i
was
picking
up
hints
of
the
sanitation
in
the
glass
flavor
had
a
mild
puckering
tang
no
hop
bitterness
and
not
too
sweet
carbonation
was
average
and
viscosity
was
above
average
delicious
aftertaste
this
was
worth
the
price
for
a
special
treat
o
some
american
sours
ive
had
dont
deliver
on
the
funk
and
sourness
but
this
one
certainly
does
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
sour
beer
ive
had
the
fruit
is
there
as
a
support
to
the
funk
and
sour
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
of
a
beer
but
for
all
the
right
reasons
certainly
a
beer
to
seek
out
if
you
love
sour
beers
but
the
sour
cherry
flavor
makes
it
my
favorite
beer
by
far
i
live
near
rrb
and
probably
drink
one
375ml
bottle
of
this
beer
every
week
i
dont
even
care
that
it
costs
13
it
is
worth
it
o
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
would
go
to
great
lengths
for
this
again
its
way
sour
but
in
an
excellent
way
super
clean
one
of
the
best
sours
brewed
in
the
u
s
rusty
oxidized
brown
in
color
cherry
oak
and
funk
on
the
nose
baby
apple
skins
cherries
and
a
nice
bit
of
backbone
from
the
pinot
noir
barrels
theres
a
hint
of
pencil
eraser
on
the
finish
a
pleasant
bit
of
funkiness
and
a
phenomenal
sour
among
the
best
o
extremely
drinkable
and
very
complex
in
flavor
top
ten
beers
in
the
world
why
not
o
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
had
overall
an
outstanding
beer
even
though
i
kept
thinking
i
was
sipping
a
wine
or
maybe
a
champagne
i
realized
that
supplication
is
a
transcendent
brew
theres
so
much
complexity
here
and
so
much
good
flavor
i
loved
this
o
its
russian
river
its
a
sour
beer
so
its
great
unaged
bottle
would
have
scored
higher
but
this
may
be
an
outlier
so
cant
say
definitively
whether
aging
is
a
good
idea
or
not
thanks
chris
for
grabbing
this
on
the
way
through
colorado
spings
poured
a
dark
amber
a
bit
red
lots
of
bubbles
khaki
head
very
creamy
but
fades
quickly
no
lacing
smell
is
fairly
one
dimensional
and
potent
its
advertising
the
presence
of
sour
cherries
taste
is
all
about
cherries
and
currants
its
sour
but
not
puckeringly
aggressive
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
acid
reminiscent
of
raspberries
a
light
dose
of
funk
but
thankfully
not
over
the
top
and
it
works
well
here
medium
light
body
and
brightly
carbonated
finish
is
cherry
tart
and
dry
definitely
shows
off
the
pinot
barrel
aging
very
good
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
sweet
but
still
a
true
sour
ale
o
a
well
done
sour
this
bottle
was
dated
102113
going
to
put
away
a
couple
to
see
how
they
age
o
seriously
sour
i
actually
think
this
was
more
sour
than
beatification
or
maybe
its
just
the
wine
adding
more
layers
of
tartness
that
amplify
the
sour
cherries
im
not
sure
strongestsourest
cherry
flavor
in
a
beer
ive
ever
had
a
little
over
the
top
for
me
but
obviously
well
crafted
big
and
bright
flavors
for
sure
barrel
aging
isnt
over
the
top
and
adds
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wine
or
wine
barrel
beers
so
my
subjectivity
is
showing
with
my
scores
its
a
good
beer
but
just
not
up
my
alley
i
think
o
im
sure
if
i
had
more
context
for
the
style
i
would
have
been
wowed
by
this
beer
but
as
such
i
am
a
sour
noob
i
still
loved
the
cherry
and
wine
notes
and
think
those
will
come
out
stronger
as
i
age
it
hopefully
one
of
the
best
sours
out
there
great
beer
temptation
is
my
favorite
of
the
line
but
this
one
is
very
amazing
perfect
sour
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
like
the
old
world
sours
to
many
of
the
american
sours
are
just
sour
and
miss
a
lot
of
the
funky
barnyard
flavor
that
a
sour
should
have
if
this
beer
is
ever
available
dont
think
twice
i
bought
this
beer
from
a
liquor
store
in
sacramento
last
summer
it
sat
in
my
fridge
for
months
decided
it
was
a
special
occasiondetroit
tigers
vs
oakland
as
playoff
game
2
i
had
forgotten
what
kind
of
beer
this
even
was
i
was
very
surprised
to
find
it
was
a
sour
type
beer
it
smelled
awesome
i
cant
even
describe
it
then
the
taste
just
awesome
nice
and
bubbly
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
the
last
time
i
got
to
enjoy
this
beauty
was
while
visiting
the
stone
brewery
there
were
so
many
amazing
choices
but
i
could
not
pass
up
this
one
while
sitting
out
on
the
stone
patio
im
kicking
myself
that
i
did
not
bring
any
home
with
me
to
mn
o
this
was
well
worth
the
wait
ive
5
bottles
staring
at
me
for
months
and
decided
that
they
had
sat
long
enough
i
cannot
wait
to
try
some
of
the
year
old
bottles
that
i
have
as
this
can
only
get
better
with
age
seek
this
out
and
you
will
be
delightfully
satisfied
pours
a
copper
color
with
some
floaties
and
a
minimal
white
head
smell
is
tart
cherries
oak
and
a
little
pinot
taste
is
tart
cherries
and
raspberries
i
get
a
little
bit
of
pinot
and
oak
not
as
tart
as
i
expected
medium
bodied
with
a
higher
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
little
dry
overall
it
is
very
good
i
just
expected
a
little
more
due
to
its
current
ranking
a
great
drink
o
every
bit
of
the
hype
is
warranted
on
this
one
mind
bending
good
o
quite
delicious
and
i
was
very
happy
to
drink
it
yep
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
great
beer
but
not
one
to
reach
for
other
than
a
special
occasion
the
sourness
isnt
overpowering
like
before
though
maybe
im
just
more
used
to
sours
the
only
big
flaw
is
its
lack
of
depth
this
beer
can
wear
on
you
quickly
especially
when
warmed
o
awesome
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
supplication
is
a
good
maybe
great
sour
but
when
measured
against
its
reputation
the
bottle
i
had
fell
short
to
that
end
it
reminds
me
alot
of
pliny
a
very
wellregarded
beer
surpassed
by
other
beers
in
the
same
genre
but
still
highly
regarded
based
on
name
recognition
for
sourheads
this
bottle
is
a
musttry
simply
based
on
what
it
is
but
for
my
money
there
are
better
sours
out
there
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
great
sour
its
extraordinarily
drinkable
for
a
sour
beer
at
nearly
8
abv
i
think
due
to
the
sweeter
elements
that
balance
out
the
sour
ones
its
very
complex
but
very
approachable
at
the
same
time
by
that
i
mean
that
there
are
aromas
and
flavors
that
scream
out
at
you
but
there
are
also
layers
upon
layers
of
other
aromas
and
flavors
if
you
keep
digging
really
my
only
complaint
as
others
have
said
is
that
i
wish
it
was
in
a
bigger
bottle
so
i
could
have
more
the
price
is
a
little
tough
too
especially
for
a
bottle
this
size
but
it
really
is
a
fantastic
beer
thank
you
so
much
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
jared
deep
copper
in
color
with
a
thin
creamcolored
head
this
had
a
softer
nose
than
i
expected
subdued
scents
of
cherries
and
grapes
with
a
little
bit
of
oak
on
my
initial
taste
the
beer
is
only
moderately
tart
and
flavors
include
cherries
grape
must
and
fresh
blackberries
from
early
in
the
season
it
finishes
dry
with
traces
of
oak
hardly
any
sweetness
at
all
the
carbonation
i
do
sense
quickly
dissipates
nearly
as
good
as
the
bottle
i
remembered
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
supplication
makes
for
a
great
addition
to
any
glass
or
beer
cellar
quite
sour
mildly
fruity
and
full
of
wild
ale
funk
enjoyable
through
and
through
thanks
to
godsbrother
for
picking
me
up
a
bottle
from
the
brewery
lovely
stuff
total
4750
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
dry
throughout
ov
im
really
wishing
this
was
a
500ml
bottle
right
now
i
love
wild
ales
and
sours
and
this
beer
is
delicious
well
done
base
with
the
addition
of
cherries
and
pn
barrel
mixing
well
and
making
this
a
well
rounded
treat
o
i
picked
this
one
up
from
a
denver
liquor
store
and
i
had
to
ask
for
russian
river
products
which
they
had
stashed
in
the
back
now
i
know
why
i
wasnt
disappointed
american
wid
ales
are
just
awesome
and
this
is
my
second
brew
from
the
style
overall
absolutely
incredible
to
be
enjoyed
any
time
of
year
absolutely
delicious
and
highly
recommended
o
will
seek
out
again
would
like
to
see
what
age
does
and
does
not
do
to
this
beer
amazing
american
sour
theres
a
lightly
tart
aroma
to
it
which
is
immediately
noticeable
the
flavor
has
a
pronounced
tartsour
cherry
character
with
a
highly
acidic
sourness
intensifying
the
tasting
experience
fantastic
brew
a
nice

this
was
an
excellent
beer
to
me
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
that
complex
and
raw
flavors
no
doubt
that
this
beer
is
complicated
nice
sourness
thats
not
over
the
top
a
pretty
easy
drinker
actually
o
very
good
sour
beer
that
gets
a
good
bit
of
flavor
from
the
added
cherries
and
aging
in
the
wine
barrels
definitely
deserves
its
spot
in
top
10
of
the
top
250
of
ba
on
tap
at
rr
brewpub
while
on
vacation
a
fairly
light
clear
brown
with
some
tan
head
light
body
and
mouthfeel
but
the
most
complex
layered
sour
i
have
tried
thus
far
reminds
me
a
it
of
morning
wood
from
against
the
grain
brewery
albeit
not
as
dark
but
similar
overall
a
fantastic
sour
beer
that
has
a
good
balance
of
sour
and
fruit
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
was
easily
attainable
we
cant
get
russian
river
beers
here
but
if
we
could
i
would
be
broke
this
along
with
all
the
other
ation
beers
we
have
triedreviewed
is
great
the
more
sour
the
better
cheers
people
we
went
to
russian
river
to
drink
the
pliny
the
elder
double
ipa
which
is
an
excellent
beer
but
i
may
have
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
the
pliny
o
very
good
beer
this
bottle
was
only
a
few
months
old
with
a
little
age
this
beer
would
be
incredible
as
it
is
its
very
good
i
thought
it
was
much
more
drinkable
than
consecration
and
although
it
is
very
tartsour
it
could
be
a
good
intro
to
sours
for
the
average
ba
never
would
pass
a
bottle
of
this
i
would
never
trade
a
bottle
of
this
and
never
would
i
not
open
it
for
a
very
special
occasion
i
was
actually
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
i
do
love
the
fruit
and
sweetness
but
the
sourness
is
a
bit
strong
it
could
use
more
complexity
still
a
wonderful
beer
aw
yea
straight
deliciousness
right
here
poured
a
deep
ruby
with
a
frothly
head
that
subsided
quickly
smells
of
fruity
cherries
barnyardhay
funk
and
tart
cherries
taste
shines
right
with
the
smell
with
a
glorious
burst
of
dark
cherry
morphing
into
tart
cherry
then
transforming
into
a
beautiful
barnyard
funk
with
some
horseblanket
and
hay
followed
by
wet
dirt
think
moist
turned
up
soil
and
light
lactic
sourness
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
bracing
carbonation
that
carries
the
flavors
around
without
being
too
abrasive
must
buy
must
try
for
the
sour
fan
brownish
red

off

not

in
the
way
of

full
of

funky

and
some
light
balsamic
with
only
a

is
funky
lots
of
tart
cherry
flavours
fairly
big
puckering
sourness
to

more
cherry
in
the
aftertaste
medium
high
carbonation
medium

just
fantastic
no
trace
of
alcohol
at
all
just
a
straight
up
excellent
sour
375ml
is
too
easy
to
drink
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
and
complexity
of
this
beer
as
you
could
taste
all
of
the
flavors
in
equal
proportions
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
sour
beer
like
i
said
ive
never
had
many
sours
so
i
wont
ever
forget
this
one
i
hope
i
can
get
this
again
o
super
impressed
this
one
is
a
winner
i
keep
delving
deeper
into
the
tion
series
and
continue
to
be
very
pleased
i
would
have
this
any
time
great
stuff
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
the
smell
reminded
me
of
some
very
good
wines
ive
had
i
cant
say
ive
every
smelled
a
beer
that
had
that
familiar
a
smell
of
a
really
good
wine
even
my
wife
who
is
much
more
a
vinophile
than
i
am
smelled
it
she
was
impressed
combine
that
with
a
phenomenal
sour
ale
and
youve
got
a
sure
winner
absolutely
phenomenal
perfect
beer
if
i
could
find
a
stock
of
this
id
buy
everything
they
had
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
was
a
deep
magenta
color
with
a
slight
bubbly
white
head
the
aroma
best
described
as
a
flowery
cherry
aroma
was
enchanting
in
the
initial
taste
one
detects
notes
of
tart
and
sour
cherry
grape
skin
sour
grapes
sour
fruit
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
from
the
barrel
aging
the
vanilla
notes
come
to
the
front
more
as
the
beer
progresses
toward
the
aftertaste
the
pleasantly
acidic
mouthfeel
is
allowed
to
linger
momentarily
as
the
ales
thickness
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
could
easily
drink
this
sour
before
any
other
i
like
it
a
lot
though
listed
as
a
wild
ale
ill
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
that
this
is
what
every
sour
should
aim
for
in
terms
of
profile
it
pours
a
burned
redorange
to
pink
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
out
of
this
world
there
are
definite
hints
of
cherry
and
pinot
noir
as
advertised
but
i
also
pick
up
a
hint
of
eggnog
oddly
enough
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
theres
a
definite
mouthpuckering
cherry
tartness
that
quickly
fades
to
a
dry
clean
finish
the
sourness
is
very
pronounced
and
i
think
it
may
mask
other
flavors
that
are
present
nevertheless
this
is
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
overall
what
nice
intro
to
wild
ales
definitely
one
of
my
top
beers
i
have
tasted
so
far
i
will
return
glad
i
forked
out
the
money
for
this
masterpiece
of
a
brewsky
pours
light
red
with
minimal
head
smells
like
red
wine
light
slightly
tart
smelling
taste
is
dominated
by
a
tart
bite
that
mellows
to
a
nice
cherry
oak
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
there
but
very
soft
overall
this
beer
is
amazing
so
well
balanced
and
dangerously
drinkable
m
good
nothing
special
here
overall
a
great
beer
im
glad
i
finally
had
the
chance
to
try
this
on
draft
o
excellent
sour
the
time
spent
in
the
pinot
noir
is
an
awesome
layer
of
flavor
decent
drinkability
o
overall
an
excellent
beer
perhaps
not
quite
living
up
to
the
hype
as
ive
had
several
american
wilds
that
are
on
par
or
a
bit
better
but
i
was
not
disappointed
at
all
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
flavoring
before
you
even
have
this
guy
it
does
a
really
really
good
job
of
raising
your
expectations
now
often
this
can
lead
to
one
being
let
down
or
disappointed
but
here
you
are
left
feeling
neither
each
flavor
that
you
expect
is
swaddled
beautifully
in
a
blanket
of
soured
yeastiness
bacterial
infection
and
solid
base
sweetness
the
fruity
bite
adds
to
both
the
sweet
and
sour
side
of
things
while
the
pinot
noir
woodiness
adds
not
only
flavoring
but
helps
to
fix
the
mouth
in
a
persistent
but
happy
pucker
the
ultimate
blend
is
truly
wonderful
in
its
simplistic
complexity
do
one
of
russian
rivers
signature
wine
barrelaged
wild
ales
supplication
excels
at
finding
the
happy
medium
between
the
golden
temptation
and
the
high
gravity
consecration
while
the
former
is
overtly
wineaffected
and
the
latter
is
challenging
for
almost
any
palate
this
is
just
right
it
successfully
captures
the
mood
of
an
authentic
belgian
kriek
at
times
comparable
to
lambics
and
flandersstyle
ales
it
deserves
to
be
held
up
as
one
of
the
superlative
examples
of
why
russian
river
beer
is
so
good
o
absolutely
delicious
the
pinot
noir
barrels
compliment
a
sour
cherry
ale
very
nicely
o
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
brilliant
complexity
and
balance
in
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
this
was
my
first
russian
river
sour
i
hope
the
others
are
on
the
same
tier
because
i
will
most
certainly
be
seeking
them
out
now
wow
yet
another
fantastic
russian
river
sour
drinkable
beyond
belief
as
long
as
you
dont
mind
a
stomach
ulcer
or
two
id
put
this
one
right
around
the
middle
of
the
pack
of
their
regular
lineup
of
sours
which
is
saying
quite
a
bit
because
even
the
bottom
ones
in
my
opinion
are
still
damn
good
i
prefer
this
to
consecration
and
sanctification
its
a
bit
more
complex
and
has
a
better
balance
of
tart
and
funk
all
these
sours
make
me
upset
that
i
dont
receive
russian
river
distribution
o
probably
the
gold
standard
of
american
wild
ales
and
sour
beers
very
good
with
a
great
amount
of
sourness
and
great
flavors
top

glass
thanks
for
reading
overall
this
is
hands
down
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
does
that
sum
it
up
o
wonderful
this
is
a
perfect
wild
ale
for
cherry
andor
sour
fans
there
is
a
ton
of
fruit
flavor
and
a
good
bit
of
mellowing
oak
sensibilities
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
brett
out
of
this
beer
but
the
lacto
is
quick
intense
i
prefer
some
of
the
other
russian
river
sours
to
this
not
a
big
cherry
fan
but
its
undeniable
that
this
is
a
world
class
wild
its
a
sipper
for
sure
and
id
be
through
the
roof
to
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
in
the
future
overall
im
amazed
at
how
good
this
beer
is
it
disappeared
so
quickly
its
that
easy
to
drink
and
appreciate
smells
great
tastes
great
and
overall
deserves
its
reputation
as
probably
the
best
awa
out
there
sour
as
hell
yet
has
its
sweetness
that
makes
it
an
incredible
sensory
experience
if
you
hate
sours
you
should
still
try
this
beer
if
you
love
sours
chances
are
youve
already
had
this
beer
so
i
dont
know
if
my
review
will
contribute
anything
to
this
site
except
to
show
how
much
i
love
drinking
this
russian
river
brew
world
class
stuff
4

theres
a
tingly
kind
of
smallbubble
carbonation
and
overall
i
really
really
like
this
brew
i
dont
want
to
abuse
the
straight
5
review
and
i
dont
want
to
be
intimidated
by
the
super
high
price
i
had
to
pay
to
try
this
brew
but
i
honestly
feel
it
is
worthy
of
5s
across
the
panel
for
me
as
much
as
i
absolutely
love
the
sour
beers
this
one
is
a
complete
winner
and
as
close
to
nirvana
as
i
plan
to
ever
get
thus
the
marks
o
a
very
nice
brew
would
love
to
get
more
i
cant
even
come
up
with
words
to
describe
how
delicious
this
is
i
will
leave
it
at
this
i
am
fairly
new
to
the
world
of
sours
but
was
spoiled
from
day
one
having
such
things
as
fou
foune
la
femme
fatale
sonderho
hipster
ale
ive
had
plenty
of
other
sours
since
and
they
just
havent
had
that
tangy
sourness
as
fou
foune
even
the
cantillon
kriek
was
good
but
not
on
par
with
fou
foune
this
however
supplication
is
just
as
acidic
and
sour
not
as
fruity
more
vinegaryacidic
with
cherries
and
grape
flavor
but
still
a
completely
delicious
cheek
wrecking
dimple
giving
sour
beer
had
this
beer
during
the
same
trip
that
i
tried
pliney
wild
beer
so
much
going
on
im
not
too
much
of
a
fan
of
wild
ales
however
this
one
was
very
drinkable
again
a
barage
is
that
how
you
spell
that
of
flavors
going
off
in
my
mouth
yeasty
bready
well
balanced
with
hops
and
the
sublte
taste
of
the
wine
barrel
that
it
was
aged
in
not
as
good
as
pliny
but
a
very
good
ale
to
say
the
least
an
enjoyable
pint
o
i
really
want
to
like
this
one
more
than
i
do
its
got
a
lot
going
for
it
but
in
the
rr
pantheon
i
prefer
consecration
and
in
the
grander
scheme
for
fair
comparisons
id
probably
go
with
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
for
about
half
the
price
to
date
i
had
tried
duchesse
monks
cafe
petrus
sour
blonde
dissident
and
odio
equus
i
knew
the
hype
was
all
around
sours
and
had
always
thought
of
them
as
more
of
a
novelty
thing
not
really
understanding
where
the
craze
was
coming
from
tried
my
first
supplication
from
russian
river
i
absolutely
get
it
now
cheers
overall
definitely
a
quality
sour
i
expected
the
cherries
to
come
out
a
bit
more
than
they
have
but
i
think
they
definitely
help
this
one
and
leave
it
well
balanced
especially
for
the
slightly
higher
abv
for
a
sour
tastes
wonderful
tart
but
not
sour
lots
of
carbonation
sweet
vinous
acidic
and
funky
but
rounded
out
i
like
o
810
sourness
amazing
sour
from
the
nose
i
expected
more
cherry
but
being
4
years
old
it
makes
sense
the
the
cherries
may
have
faded
just
enough
cherry
to
balance
the
vinegar
and
sourness
o
enjoyed
the
complexity
in
the
aroma
many
things
going
on
here
stark
contrast
to
the
taste
portion
flavorwise
this
beer
shows
a
lot
of
harder
to
find
dimensionsflavors
feel
was
what
i
would
look
for
to
compliment
this
ones
just
not
for
me
o
im
still
not
a
huge
sour
guy
but
this
beer
is
top
notch
the
flavors
are
light
refreshing
and
crisp
while
still
maintaining
complexity
love
the
cherries
oak
must
lemon
tart
elements
awesome
beer
and
at
the
top
in
its
style
this
is
quite
a
beer
im
honored
to
have
been
able
to
taste
one
of
the
best
sours
out
there
and
i
was
highly
impressed
its
complex
robust
and
balanced
the
acidity
is
not
cloying
in
the
least
bit
and
works
well
with
the
winebarrel
notes
a
must
try
for
all
beer
advocates
i
was
incredibly
spoiled
for
this
to
be
the
first
sour
beer
i
ever
tried
on
new
years
eve
2012
12
for
a
12
oz
bottle
and
worth
it
dark
red
in
appearance
with
incredible
champagnelike
bubbling
that
didnt
stop
the
bubbles
felt
great
without
being
overpowering
the
various
yeasts
combined
to
create
a
notoverpowering
sour
flavor
mostly
of
cherries
and
wine
grapes
with
some
slight
wood
flavors
from
the
pinot
barrels
such
an
awesome
beer
having
now
tried
a
bunch
of
russian
river
sours
this
is
still
my
favorite
although
consecration
tastes
very
similar
and
is
somewhat
stronger
o
just
another
great
russian
river
sour
cherries
and
pino
noir
are
a
very
nice
touch
overall
one
of
the
best
awas
youll
ever
have
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
pretty
close
to
perfect
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
smells
strongly
of
tart
cherries
and
sour
grapes
and
tastes
the
same
not
an
offensive
flavor
very
tasty
overall
taste
is
dominated
by
a
pleasant
tart
cherry
flavor
of
all
the
sour
beers
i
have
had
which
is
only
about
5
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
i
would
eagerly
have
a
full
pint
of
this
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
with
most
sours
pours
a
hazy
dark
brownish
ruby
color
with
a
half
finger
head
that
dissipates
very
slowly
and
leaves
a
blanket
of
lacing
tons
of
sediment
but
that
is
expected
with
the
amount
of
yeast
added
smells
of
funky
sour
cherries
oak
vinegar
grapes
lots
of
funkiness
lots
of
dryness
that
really
does
give
it
a
winelike
smell
smells
almost
like
a
cherry
warhead
taste
starts
with
a
very
astringent
dry
sour
cherry
flavor
as
well
as
some
oak
and
funkiness
then
get
some
of
the
brown
ale
qualities
slight
breadiness
maybe
some
cocoa
but
i
could
just
be
imagining
that
some
carmel
malt
then
the
astringent
sour
notes
from
the
brett
and
bacteria
come
back
even
stronger
along
with
lots
more
cherry
grape
funkiness
vinegar
oak
some
carmel
extremely
dry
finish
that
blends
the
wine
and
the
beer
qualities
nicely
so
sour
yet
extremely
balanced
high
medium
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
very
lively
carbonation
from
the
refermentation
that
does
give
it
a
very
champagnelike
crisp
finish
very
complex
and
so
delicious
just
getting
into
this
style
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
wont
come
across
many
sours
better
than
this
one
hope
to
try
this
again
someday
o
great
beer
russian
rivers
best
rotational
sour
o
the
melange
of
flavors
sums
to
an
indescribable
concoction
that
grays
the
area
between
beer
and
wine
the
product
is
a
sour
ale
with
flavors
that
are
boldly
distinct
yet
combine
together
with
synergism
a
wonderful
brew
that
is
a
must
try
for
all
beer
lovers
out
there
o
finally
starting
to
truly
develop
a
palate
for
sours
this
one
isnt
my
favorite
but
it
drinks
well
and
has
enough
sweetness
to
balance
o
i
continue
to
be
extremely
impressed
with
russian
river
sours
i
would
go
as
far
as
to
say
i
love
this
beer
it
is
delicious
has
so
much
depth
and
so
many
flavors
it
pretty
much
has
everything
as
advertised
cherries
pino
and
yeastsour
taste
i
cant
think
of
how
to
improve
it
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
definitely
up
there
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
this
is
a
marvelously
drinkable
beer
and
a
classic
american
wild
ale
one
of
my
favorite
readily
available
sours
the
balance
of
tart
sweet
and
oak
in
this
brew
is
superb
especially
when
fresh
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
a
bit
and
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
carbonation
in
the
bottling
of
this
beer
otherwise
its
fantastic
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
nice
appearance
although
not
much
in
terms
of
head
or
lacing
nose
is
a
basic
but
a
strong
fruity
bready
combo
flavor
is
fruity
but
only
a
little
sweet
white
bready
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
this
doesnt
become
the
highest
ranked
american
wild
ale
on
beeradvocate
com
without
good
reason
this
beer
is
absolutely
awesome
and
extremely
ahead
of
its
timefor
american
craft
beer
when
it
first
came
out
in
the
early
2000s
this
beer
is
awesome
and
do
to
its
extreme
sourness
i
can
only
recommend
it
to
seasoned
sour
fanatics
odwhat
a
success
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
come
across
deserves
its
nearly
godly
reputation
this
could
turn
any
wine
lover
into
a
beer
lover
with
one
quick
sip
o
this
is
a
really
great
sour
beer
on
the
sour
side
of
balanced
i
think
lots
of
people
could
enjoy
this
as
it
really
plays
all
the
bases
well
im
interested
to
see
what
its
like
after
some
time
in
the
cellar
bottom
line
world
class
offering
again
thank
you
so
much
matttyce
and
beachstrength49
for
this
brew
you
guys
are
awesome
overall
this
wild
ale
has
some
similarities
to
the
temptation
but
is
more
sour
and
has
flavors
of
red
grapeswine
vs
the
white
the
aromas
and
taste
are
strongerbolder
and
more
sour
here
an
outstanding
beer
o
super
sour
with
a
nice
cherry
presence
but
this
one
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
though
verdict
a
truly
world
class
wild
ale
one
of
the
more
complex
beers
on
the
market
and
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
what
a
sour
beer
can
become
everything
is
in
harmony
with
each
sip
a
beer
everyone
must
try
but
then
again
maybe
not
d
super
solid
brew
understandable
why
it
is
becoming
the
benchmark
for
american
wilds
great
complexity
and
balance
glad
to
see
the
grain
peek
its
head
out
from
a
blanket
of
acidity
if
you
have
the
ability
to
get
this
get
it
overall
my
expectations
were
high
probably
because
its
russian
river
but
once
again
they
were
exceeded
greatly
ive
now
had
almost
all
the
rr
sourswilds
now
and
while
they
differ
in
certain
aspects
they
have
all
been
nothing
short
of
fantastic
its
like
they
have
different
sours
to
fit
your
different
moods
much
like
there
are
types
of
wines
and
the
barrels
they
age
these
in
is
there
a
better
brewery
for
this
many
quality
american
wild
ales
in
the
country
i
think
not
what
a
beautiful
concoction
that
russian
river
has
once
again
delivered
words
cannot
recommend
this
more
its
really
complex
but
all
the
flavors
meld
together
that
it
is
really
balanced
its
not
too
yeasty
yet
nicely
sour
not
too
malty
yet
quite
thickened
not
too
fruity
yet
deliciously
tart
overall
will
be
trying
more
of
these
wild
ales
from
rr
in
future
for
sure
overall
this
is
incredible
glad
i
have
another
bottle
overall
the
cherries
get
to
be
a
bit
much
when
it
warms
up
but
sipping
it
slowly
reveals
a
complex
combination
of
tasty
flavors
and
aromas
near
perfect
beer
well
done
rrbc
o
the
mountain
top
of
sours
extremely
high
quality
very
flavorful
without
being
a
big
beer
one
of
the
paragons
of
the
style
o
a
really
well
done
sour
that
has
a
nice
balance
of
tartness
fruitiness
and
funkiness
that
isnt
too
mouth
puckering
would
love
to
have
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
and
see
how
it
develops
o
at
13
for
a
pint
id
buy
a
6
pack
highly
highly
recommend
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
had
and
once
again
russian
river
hits
a
home
run
on
sours
i
for
one
will
always
look
to
try
any
sour
beer
that
vinnie
and
the
team
put
out
as
they
are
always
fantastic
my
hats
off
once
again
o
a
balanced
and
complex
sour
beer
along
with
temptation
and
consecration
its
one
of
the
better
russian
river
beers
but
pales
in
comparison
to
beatification
just
dont
compare
it
to
a
kriek
it
doesnt
taste
like
one
being
much
darker
and
heavier
i
waited
too
long
to
try
this
one
despite
its
hefty
price
tag
12
its
one
ill
be
enjoying
from
time
to
time
the
reviews
on
this
are
excellent
and
i
agree
it
feels
light
tastes
moderately
sour
and
smells
so
good
that
its
hard
to
savor
i
like
this
a
little
more
than
consecration
but
its
close
overall
an
awesome
beer
that
is
complex
but
not
overly
so
and
very
tasty
i
only
wish
i
had
another
bottle
overall
this
is
a
really
great
sour
beer
i
dont
believe
it
is
the
best
i
have
had
by
far
but
i
cannot
deny
the
extremely
high
drinkability
this
possesses
normally
i
do
not
seek
out
this
beer
because
of
the
high
price
tag
and
average
flavor
profile
for
a
sour
but
for
5
on
draft
ill
take
that
everyday
of
the
week
and
2x
on
zwanze
day
pours
a
rusted
brown
with
a
little
brownish
head
that
sticks
around
longer
than
expected
lots
of
oak
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
sour
cherry
but
nothing
overpowering
theres
also
a
bit
of
red
wine
and
some
funkiness
but
not
that
much
really
over
ripe
cherries
start
the
palate
off
and
then
theres
a
nice
funky
wood
middle
with
a
solid
sour
finish
that
doesnt
last
quite
as
long
as
id
like
i
got
a
bit
too
much
head
and
resulted
in
a
little
flatter
then
i
think
it
would
have
been
otherwise
really
a
great
beer
though
d
nice
substitute
for
what
i
was
looking
for
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
rr
andor
sours
well
balanced
better
than
beatification
imo
o
this
beer
might
not
be
worth
the
price
tag
but
its
definitely
solid
im
going
to
attempt
to
age
a
couple
of
bottles
o
a
well
done
sour
ale
through
its
woody
slightly
vinous
aspect
quite
sober
all
the
same
high
carbonation
light
body
slightly
sticky
on
the
lips
o
wow
a
complex
fruity
sour
with
a
whole
lot
of
balance
well
worth
getting
a
hold
of
this
beer
could
easily
substitute
for
light
to
moderate
red
wine
when
paired
with
food
there
a
quiet
a
few
beers
with
more
sour
than
this
but
supplication
has
elegant
refined
flavor
i
want
nothing
more
out
this
beer
than
say
a
few
more
bottles
o
this
beer
is
absolutely
delicious
and
makes
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
browned
red
witha
finger
and
change
of
eggshell
head
moderate
retention
and
good
lacing
nose
has
oak
cherries
light
acetic
mild
vinous
character
and
some
underlying
sweet
malt
predominantly
masked
by
the
acid
some
underripe
apple
as
well
taste
has
sweet
oak
and
malt
character
initially
and
opens
up
immediately
into
really
juicy
cherries
acid
and
finishes
with
a
subtle
pucker
more
acidic
than
directly
tartsour
shred
of
alcohol
mediumhigh
carbonation
slight
spritz
in
the
conclusion
complex
and
fantastically
delicious
has
all
of
the
qualities
i
love
in
a
sour
overall
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
wouldnt
recommend
this
for
someones
first
sour
at
the
same
time
i
love
the
pinot
barrel
taste
and
the
complexities
not
necessarily
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
but
i
would
certainly
recommend
dont
get
why
so
many
find
this
one
world
class
had
many
european
sours
that
trump
this
one
either
way
i
woould
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
to
see
if
i
spot
anything
else
good
stuff
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
sours
might
be
my
new
favorite
thing
not
sure
any
will
ever
beat
supplication
though
overall
the
best
sour
ive
had
this
is
the
first
of
my
russian
river
sours
and
definitely
going
to
make
it
challenging
to
continue
aging
my
other
rr
sours
in
my
cellar
still
amazed
how
all
the
different
layers
can
separately
and
clearly
present
themselves
as
you
drink
the
sips
down
o
absolutely
delicious
sour
never
gets
old
edit
i
recently
opened
a
bottle
from
batch
11
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
found
much
more
oak
and
tart
vinous
complexity
than
my
review
above
indicates
tasty
im
surprised
how
much
i
enjoy
this
after
being
soso
on
the
tempation
hats
of
to
russian
river
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
sour
and
i
must
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
too
spent
18
dollars
on
this
but
i
wont
let
it
effect
my
review
this
poured
with
a
very
thin
head
with
little
carbonated
look
the
color
was
cloudy
grainy
red
and
brown
i
love
the
scent
its
tart
and
sour
with
a
wine
like
aroma
but
a
sweet
cherry
scent
after
the
initial
shock
of
the
tartness
i
became
very
comfortable
and
savor
end
the
flavor
it
was
like
an
ale
mixed
with
a
red
wine
which
is
very
close
to
what
it
is
overall
im
delighted
with
this
experience
o
the
best
sour
ive
had
yet
the
balance
is
perfect
and
the
flavor
is
incredible
extremely
sour
at
first
but
tamed
by
a
light
sweetness
and
mild
tartness
o
not
great
i
dont
really
understand
the
praise
for
this
beer
its
not
terrible
but
it
reminds
me
of
everything
i
dont
like
about
awas
overly
sour
with
little
complexity
first
of
all
yes
i
paid
18
for
this
beer
which
i
think
is
outrageous
but
i
always
have
to
grab
up
russian
river
beers
when
i
see
them
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
color
with
lots
of
active
carbonation
the
head
was
one
finger
and
pure
white
and
lingered
around
for
awhile
although
it
didnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
on
the
nose
there
was
a
definite
presence
of
cherries
and
funk
minor
notes
on
the
nose
included
oak
and
a
bit
of
red
wine
complexity
much
on
the
first
sip
the
first
thing
i
think
is
that
this
beer
is
crazy
tart
it
took
me
a
few
sips
to
get
used
to
that
it
also
didnt
have
as
much
funk
as
i
thought
it
would
after
i
got
used
to
that
there
was
definitely
oak
and
cherries
in
the
taste
the
carbonation
is
definitely
active
and
goes
well
with
the
brew
which
is
much
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
this
brew
almost
reminds
me
of
a
red
wine
which
also
could
be
because
it
was
aged
in
pinot
noir
barrels
the
finish
lingers
with
tart
cherries
although
this
would
not
be
a
beer
i
could
have
every
night
the
complexity
really
makes
it
an
amazing
beer
i
would
have
this
again
in
a
second
pours
copper
hued
than
brown
with
a
very
good
head
and
lace
the
aroma
has
big
funk
and
cherry
notes
with
some
earthy
and
dusty
character
light
notes
of
caramel
and
bready
malts
as
well
the
taste
starts
with
tart
cherries
soft
oak
undertone
and
biting
brett
nature
the
pinot
noir
does
show
but
only
at
the
finish
along
with
some
subdued
spice
bright
and
dry
mouthfeel
very
lambic
in
nature
did
not
expect
the
sparkling
texture
from
how
she
looked
in
the
glass
gorgeous
o
probably
the
most
complex
of
the
russian
river
sours
that
ive
had
each
sip
brings
something
new
as
it
is
tart
sweet
and
funky
all
in
one
beer
overall
another
sour
that
i
love
definitely
world
class
and
after
having
pte
and
supplication
im
really
looking
forward
to
consecration
375ml
batch

pours
a
cloudy
blood
orange
with
a
towering
rocky
tan
head
that
leaves
insane
lacing
aroma
of
cotton
candy
lacto
sour
cherries
baked
cherry
pie
im
still
not
too
keen
on
the
taste
here
the
body
is
thin
and
spritzy
and
there
is
a
massive
oak
dryness
tannin
leather
quality
that
distracts
from
the
cherry
and
sour
elements
its
damn
good
but
i
would
take
beatification
consecration
or
temptation
over
this
any
day

is

which
leaves
you
coming

for

certainly
very
excited
to
try
this
little
treat
here
and
while
it
was
pricey
it
was
worth
it
for
having
a
chance
to
experience
this
excellent
sour
ive
only
recently
begun
to
dabble
in
the
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
so
far
m
tastes
like
i
just
had
a
big
glass
of
sparkling
red
wine
haha
very
nice
subtle
aftertaste
overall
a
fantastic
beer
thanks
to
dovalihops
for
this
gem
ill
have
to
trade
for
it
again
o
a
delight
to
drink
just
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
anyway
you
got
that
wine
smelltaste
with
some
tart
cherries
and
oak
flavor
its
phenominal
and
wholly
unique
youll
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
sour
overall
a
pretty
good
wild
ale
i
would
drink
this
again
if
someone
gave
it
to
mel
its
official
one
great
sour
one
of
my
favorites
in
fact
sour
power
thanks
egrace84
for
the
wind
down
beer
finally
got
to
try
this
beer
and
it
didnt
disappoint
smooth
tasted
great
and
sweet
overall
really
great
sour
but
i
think
i
prefer
sanctification
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
medium
white
head
smell
is
topnotch
red
wine
cherries
oak
and
lactic
sourness
all
are
in
there
and
combine
together
quite
nicely
and
make
my
mouth
water
flavor
follows
the
nose
almost
exactly
red
wine
and
oak
stand
out
at
first
then
we
get
a
little
bit
of
the
sweet
cherries
in
the
middle
before
a
blast
of
sourness
hits
on
the
back
end
its
really
quite
complex
and
excellent
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
really
nice
carbonation
with
a
great
mouthcoating
bite
overall
this
really
proves
that
russian
rivers
yearround
wilds
are
better
than
most
of
the
other
limited
wilds
out
there
its
a
great
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
o
this
beer
is
my
new
standard
for
sours
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
even
if
the
price
is
high
o
amazing
beer
as
expected
cant
think
of
much
to
make
this
beret
18
per
bottle
here
o
extremely
complex
with
a
moderate
sourness
transforms
multiple
times
throughout
the
palate
big
oaky
characteristics
with
a
good
emphasis
on
sweet
red
wine
a
lot
of
fruity
and
nutty
flavors
going
on
as
well
theres
not
as
much
barnyard
as
reviews
suggest
more
of
a
lactic
sourness
phenomenal
o
very
impressed
russian
river
is
successful
in
merging
the
fine
characteristics
of
wine
to
the
fine
characteristics
of
beer
a
must
try
sour
glad
i
have
another
bottle
o
got
to
be
my
favorite
wild
ale
in
the
country
at
the
moment
could
drink
this
every
day
d
a
bit
more
graceful
than
your
typical
sour
unique
in
that
i
can
sense
the
alterations
between
both
the
grapes
and
the
cherries
very
easy
to
revisit
this
one
and
for
that
i
am
thankful
o
quite
enjoyable
o
take
my
review
for
what
it
is
worth
as
i
admittedly
dont
care
much
for
sours
though
i
do
tend
to
like
and
appreciate
rr
sour
beers
but
something
about
this
beer
just
didnt
sit
right
with
me
and
while
i
do
think
this
a
very
finely
crafted
beer
i
think
i
just
found
it
too
sour
too
acetic
too
similar
to
the
beginnings
of
a
nice
salad
dressing
for
me
to
be
able
to
really
enjoy
it
o
this
was
a
fantastic
sour
im
just
getting
into
sours
but
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
the
smell
was
phenomenal
very
aromatic
and
could
smell
forever
the
flavor
was
also
excellent
with
a
nice
amount
of
sourness
and
fruit
flavors
that
were
very
well
balanced
a
little
bit
more
age
probably
would
have
helped
this
a
little
bit
the
2009
lou
pepe
kriek
i
had
a
couple
weeks
ago
definitely
had
more
flavor
definitely
not
bad
though
for
a
sour
of
this
caliber
that
has
been
barrel
aged
for
over
a
year
you
cant
beat
the
price
on
this
one
a
must
try
for
sour
fans
overall
my
favorite
offering
in
therussian
river
wild
ale
lineup
a
solid
blend
of
fruit
and
barrel
tartness
more
of
this
would
never
be
a
bad
thing
o
its
a
great
sour
gets
better
with
every
sip
would
age
well
would
pair
well
with
cheese
its
wine
its
beer
its
sour
its
great
its
an
experience
d
if
flanders
and
the
willamette
valley
pinot
growers
had
a
love
child
this
would
be
it
very
drinkable
o
my
first
real
foray
into
sours
its
a
treat
not
a
malt
bomb
or
a
hop
bomb
but
a
cherry
tart
bomb
and
its
just
so
drinkable
with
the
cherries
shining
through
but
not
being
overpowering
loved
it
overall
nothing
special
in
my
opinion
decent
enough
beer
and
it
did
grew
on
me
a
little
as
i
went
on
but
many
of
its
belgian
cousins
are
vastly
superior
overall
this
beer
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
i
wish
i
had
tried
it
sooner
edit
after
more
extensive
sour
testing
this
is
defintely
a
higher
quality
beer
than
i
initially
gave
it
credit
for
raised
to
a
solid
4
5
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
d
very
drinkable
the
sour
cherries
come
through
really
nicely
without
being
overpowering
the
balance
is
very
nice
with
the
barrel
flavors
adding
some
great
complexity
o
not
really
sure
what
to
say
its
unique
different
incredibly
complex
and
an
experience
in
itself
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
is
pungently
sour
with
notes
of
acetone
wine
and
a
slight
yeastiness
very
intense
flavor
profile
with
bursting
tart
cherries
and
an
incredibly
dry
finish
this
may
be
one
of
the
driest
and
most
tart
sours
ive
had
but
its
incredibly
drinkable
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
can
finagle
a
bottle
outstanding
thin
thin
head
dissipates
but
continues
to
create
sliding
lace
as
i
sip
if
youre
a
sourwild
lover
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
the
finest
ive
ever
had
in
the
style
tart
nose
right
off
the
bat
incites
salivation
dried
notsoripened
cherries
some
kind
of
subtle
lactose
in
the
taste
drying
tannin
tart
flavor
with
cherries
and
big
oak
dont
have
words
its
one
of
those
beers
that
make
you
think
howd
they
make
a
beer
do
that
for
the
record
i
dont
like
wilds
cheers
i
still
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
of
sours
but
this
does
make
me
want
to
try
more
of
the
style
cost
10
for
a
355
ml
bottle
made
from
glass
that
is
so
thick
youd
swear
this
was
a
blunt
weapon
o
worthy
i
like
it
a
lot
really
coming
on
board
with
rr
wild
ales
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
simply
put
wow
on
tap
at
bobby
gs
51712
batch
10
pours
a
reddish
brown
amber
with
a
small
white
head
settles
to
a
ring
and
leaves
some
very
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
lots
of
lactic
acid
cherry
funky
earthiness
slight
hop
presence
and
a
hint
of
acetic
acid
the
taste
is
tart
with
a
light
initial
sweetness
lots
of
lactic
decent
amount
of
cherry
and
just
a
bit
of
brett
funkiness
the
finish
is
tart
and
drying
with
a
bit
of
acetic
acid
medium
body
medium
carbonation
certainly
one
of
the
best
regularly
available
sours
quite
nice
cherry
is
subtle
and
really
sophisticated
oi
would
dump
this
in
the
russian
river
if
i
could
maybe
ill
revisit
it
in
the
future
but
why
bother
recommended
im
anxious
to
see
where
this
brew
goes
in
time
ill
be
sure
to
update
its
sour
but
not
mind
buckling
sour
the
pinot
noir
barrels
do
this
brew
wonders
o
can
i
buy
a
case
i
like
this
especially
for
being
a
nonbelgian
beer
this
was
one
of
the
two
beers
that
i
tried
to
see
if
i
liked
sour
beers
i
dont
this
beer
poured
a
strawberry
blonde
into
a
snifter
their
was
a
rush
of
carbonation
that
left
no
head
and
no
lacing
this
one
tastes
like
a
sour
cherry
wine
cooler
zero
beer
taste
i
should
note
that
i
do
not
like
wine
and
this
beer
had
a
very
distinct
pinot
noir
flavor
to
it
every
sip
made
me
pucker
up
and
shiver
from
the
sourness
of
everything
in
one
beer
sour
beers
are
not
for
me
o
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
a
lot
more
than
my
first
one
in
fact
i
will
drink
this
more
in
the
near
future
i
still
seem
to
prefer
temptation
and
beatification
over
this
one
but
regardless
an
excellent
sour
o
best
sour
ive
had
so
far
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
sour
really
glad
i
had
the
whole
little
bottle
to
myself
to
let
it
warm
up
and
explore
the
intricacies
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
if
i
see
it
had
this
at
the
brewery
pours
a
dark
ruby
amber
tastes
quite
sour
but
its
not
overpowering
in
fact
it
tastes
fucking
awesome
lots
of
sour
cherry
notes
that
just
made
my
mouth
water
a
little
bit
of
tartness
with
each
sip
too
i
wish
i
had
another
pint
right
now
one
of
the
best
and
most
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
pours
a
thin
brownish
rust
color
with
a
short
but
very
active
tan
head
fizzy
smells
like
sour
cherries
old
church
wine
and
brettanomyces
its
almost
like
smelling
salts
it
throws
the
head
back
in
intensity
wow
flavor
is
hard
to
describe
there
are
notes
of
cherries
but
nothing
sweet
there
is
so
much
sour
here
it
puckers
you
rich
up
for
a
moment
then
it
goes
insanely
dry
and
is
gone
without
a
trace
the
brown
ale
base
is
inconsequential
here
as
the
bacteria
and
fruit
steal
the
show
the
tannic
tang
from
the
wine
barrels
adds
another
layer
of
sour
depth
to
this
one
feel
is
perfect
perfect
perfect
more
than
effervescent
carbonation
serves
the
sour
train
well
and
the
drinkably
medium
body
is
a
welcomed
surprise
russian
river
rules
the
roost
on
beers
of
this
genre
this
baby
is
alltime
o
pretty
good
still
not
a
fan
of
sour
ales
but
its
the
best
one
ive
had
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
i
didnt
have
to
go
so
far
out
of
my
way
to
get
the
greatness
coming
from
russian
river
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
this
may
just
be
my
favorite
rr
sour
its
got
a
big
sour
bite
but
a
rich
flavor
that
goes
beyond
that
the
fruity
and
woody
notes
help
make
every
sip
as
interesting
as
the
last
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
this
one
this
ones
changed
the
way
i
look
at
sours
such
a
well
made
brew
many
things
needed
to
happen
in
just
the
right
proportion
and
order
to
make
this
what
it
is
on
top
of
that
it
also
needed
to
be
well
packaged
and
sent
to
me
by
the
most
generous
and
awesome
rutager
o
this
is
a
great
sour
beer
and
one
that
i
could
enjoy
drinking
very
regularly
if
only
it
was
more
easily
available
this
beer
embodies
what
a
sourwild
ale
should
be
not
overly
sour
to
put
off
people
new
to
the
style
but
still
really
great
o
for
my
first
big
sour
this
is
a
big
win
russian
river
can
do
no
wrong
as
long
as
i
forget
about
redemption
o
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
beer
my
experience
with
sours
is
limited
but
compared
to
what
i
have
had
this
is
in
the
top
2
on
my
list
russian
river
never
fails
to
impress
me
overall
a
masterpiece
in
complexity
balance
and
straightout
deliciousness
o
a
very
wellcrafted
wild
ale
by
russian
river
its
not
as
good
as
consecration
but
it
is
still
one
of
the
better
wilds
i
have
had
i
am
officially
pumped
to
get
into
beatification
now
o
very
drinkable
wild
ale
not
really
a
weak
spot
for
me
a
sipper
that
went
pretty
quick
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couplefew
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
den
do
i
know
this
is
a
top
50
brew
but
im
still
surprised
i
really
like
this
im
not
a
sour
guy
id
say
this
is
better
than
many
belgian
brews
though
personally
id
still
prefer
a
new
glarus
belgian
red
probably
about
as
close
to
as
good
as
it
gets
for
the
style
this
is
my
second
wild
ale
my
first
was
consecration
this
in
my
opinion
isnt
as
flavorful
as
consecration
but
its
delicous
and
worth
trying
its
drinkable
flavorful
but
its
a
sipper
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
this
is
one
outstanding
beer
if
youre
looking
for
rich
fruits
and
deeply
complex
malts
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
theres
no
hop
bite
in
the
tailend
sans
a
little
bitterness
nor
is
there
heavy
breathcatching
sourness
this
wild
ale
is
all
about
balance
complexity
and
drinkability
scarce
in
the
flaw
department
this
beer
drinks
like
a
great
wine
a
real
shmoozer
skoals
4
5
overall
an
excellent
wild
ale
and
as
good
as
some
of
the
belgians
ive
had
probably
not
for
everyone
but
definitely
recommended
3
5o
eh
its
alright
but
rr
makes
a
lot
of
beers
that
are
better
and
there
are
many
sourswild
ales
that
top
this
one
not
recommended
in
bottles
this
is
a
world
class
beer
the
flavor
is
aggressively
sour
but
theres
an
underlying
sweetness
and
a
nice
dry
finish
to
complement
the
tartness
its
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
had
and
is
very
reminiscent
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
in
overall
drinking
experience
if
not
in
flavor
every
beer
fan
should
seek
this
one
out
and
try
it
at
least
once
i
cant
imagine
how
difficult
this
beer
must
be
to
make
picked
up
the
last
bottle
on
the
shelf
at
a
random
store
for
under
10
what
batch
009
wondered
if
something
was
wrong
with
it
but
for
the
price
i
was
willing
to
find
out
poured
to
duvel
tulip
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
ruby
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
some
retention
some
lacing
looks
great
for
a
beer
aged
15
months
in
pinot
barrels
the
nose
is
even
better
nice
cherry
apple
pear
fruit
character
mixes
with
with
a
mild
brett
funk
sour
tartness
i
dont
know
how
this
could
be
more
inviting
the
flavor
is
complex
and
perfect
really
tart
sourness
at
first
that
blends
to
a
mild
sour
cherry
to
lightly
bitter
caramel
with
a
light
biscuity
background
so
much
flavor
so
much
going
on
its
amazing
this
comes
together
so
well
phenomenal
good
carbonation
and
medium
to
full
bodied
overall
this
beer
is
classic
i
think
i
am
in
love
i
wont
wait
so
long
between
bottles
next
time
as
i
forgot
how
memorable
this
is
overall
a
phenomenal
beer
this
brewer
having
once
been
focused
on
wine
knows
what
he
is
doing
and
does
it
well
overall
this
is
an
unbelieveable
sour
i
love
the
complexity
not
as
funky
as
i
anticipated
but
still
it
was
truly
a
treat
to
drink
looking
forward
to
putting
the
second
bottle
in
my
cellar
to
see
what
some
age
can
do
if
russian
rivers
supplication
were
cheaper
and
actually
available
in
my
area
i
would
drink
this
daily
overall
this
was
a
good
refreshing
beer
would
love
to
have
this
in
the
mountains
on
a
spring
day
not
too
much
into
the
particular
style
but
would
definitely
buy
another
bottle
whenever
it
rarely
pops
up
overall
so
impressed
by
this
beer
and
would
happily
drop
another
15
to
get
another
bottle
o
a
good
sour
overall
though
the
taste
doesnt
have
quite
the
complexity
of
the
nose
still
very
enjoyable
like
it
yes
of
course
o
great
beer
excellent
tart
sourness
with
some
bready
malt
rounded
out
with
belgium
yeast
well
balanced
with
strong
but
not
over
powering
sourness
this
is
the
third
rr
wild
ale
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
all
were
fantastic
supplication
consecration
and
temptation
i
think
i
may
slightly
like
temptation
the
best
however
all
are
wonderful
and
id
gladly
drink
any
of
them
any
chance
i
could
get
o
i
have
always
liked
sours
and
this
one
just
cements
that
feeling
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
wish
that
this
beer
were
available
around
here

i

wonderful
overall
this
is
a

might
even
appeal
to
the
nonsour
beer
drinker
yum
o
again
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
quality
through
and
through
a
overall
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
three
russian
river
sours
i
have
had
and
the
only
one
that
i
feel
can
compete
with
true
lambics
i
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
in
the
future
o
slowly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
sours
out
there
worth
the
price
tag
for
sure
overall
a
truly
excellent
sour
with
very
nice
fruit
flavors
a
perfect
balance
of
sour
and
sweet
to
keep
you
wanting
another
sip
the
first
sour
i
have
ever
had
served
on
tap
in
a
10
5
oz
tulip
glass
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
nice
amber
color
nice
small
head
that
settles
at
the
top
of
the
glass
and
dissipates
as
you
continue
to
drink
the
taste
is
fruity
and
bold
with
hints
of
cherry
oak
and
red
wine
the
cherry
taste
is
there
and
stays
with
the
beer
with
every
drink
it
has
become
the
sour
on
which
i
will
judge
every
other
sour
on
im
not
going
to
recap
here
just
an
amazing
beer
a
great
sipping
beer
very
nice
with
kevins
deluxe
blue
cheese
caramelized
onion
and
fig
pizza
overall
all
that
has
to
be
said
is
wow
what
an
incredible
brew
this
brew
was
most
likely
one
of
the
best
things
i
have
ever
put
to
my
lips
just
sayin
really
wish
i
had
another
one
of
these
in
the
fridge
the
best
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
might
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
too
rr
rules
thanks
again
jeff
o
balance
balance
balance
that
says
it
all
a
great
sour
and
i
am
not
a
huge
sour
fan
well
balanced
rich
taste
mouth
feel
and
a
great
nose
overall
this
is
phenomenal
a
strong
sour
cherry
presence
that
plays
beautifully
off
of
the
more
subtle
citrus
and
light
grain
notes
the
wine
barrels
add
an
extra
layer
of
complexity
that
will
certainly
keep
one
coming
back
for
more
o
this
is
a
great
sour
o
after
the
initial
smell
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
but
a
few
sips
and
it
completely
won
me
over
this
stuff
is
awesome
and
ill
get
it
in
the
future
if
i
can
ok
ill
admit
i
knew
this
beer
was
going
to
be
great
if
i
could
make
something
this
good
at
home
i
dont
know
if
id
ever
leave
another
fantastic
offering
from
one
of
americas
top
breweries
most
people
will
admit
they
dont
like
sour
beer
and
it
does
sound
gross
at
first
but
give
this
a
try
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
this
is
the
kind
of
sour
ale
where
each
sip
beckons
for
the
next
a
refreshing
change
from
the
hop
overload
of
rrs
famous
other
beers
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
sourness
of
it
but
in
an
enjoyable
way
the
mouthfeel
is
wine
like
in
its
tartness
but
entices
you
to
drink
more
this
is
a
beer
that
defines
specialty
hand
craftsmanship
and
care
get
it
on
tap
if
you
can
this
beer
does
not
bottle
well
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
sour
beers
ive
had
to
date
o
another
fantastic
beer
from
rr
this
one
is
usually
my
goto
beer
from
rr
as
it
is
usually
readily
available
and
uber
choice
allaround
the
complexity
yet
simplicity
is
so
perfect
that
words
do
not
do
it
justice
if
you
havent
tried
it
go
get
it
if
you
have
tried
it
and
dont
like
it
send
the
rest
my
way
if
you
enjoy
it
like
me
i
dig
your
style
and
maybe
ill
invite
you
when
i
crack
open
the
large
format
that
will
be
epic
i
have
been
waiting
to
open
this
batch
8
things
of
beauty
well
super
bwl
sunday
seems
as
good
of
a
time
as
ever
on
he
brief
tip
this
beer
delivers
on
everything
it
promises
the
pint
noir
barrels
come
thru
nicely
the
cherries
along
with
the
trio
of
yeasts
make
this
a
tart
number
with
a
delicious
zing
very
nice
mouthfeel
but
the
flavor
is
the
star
of
the
show
and
i
believe
this
flavor
earned
an
oscar
nomination
in
my
eyes
this
beer
has
gone
to
territory
only
held
previously
by
abyss
and
bcbs
well
there
is
a
new
king
of
the
hill
so
let
us
see
if
any
other
wild
ales
or
sours
can
knock
supplication
off
its
new
perch
challenge
o
one
of
the
best
sours
for
a
reason
ive
had
this
one
multiple
times
and
still
love
it
o
one
of
the
best
american
sour
beers
you
can
get
a
really
tasty
refreshing
brew
oa
deliciously
crafted
ale
with
a
great
blend
of
flavors
overall
refreshingly
wellbalanced
between
the
sour
and
fruit
great
for
a
sunny
afternoon
picnic
or
just
complimenting
some
brie
crackers
if
you
like
sours
this
is
the
one
to
have
the
flavor
impeccably
recreates
what
the
aroma
suggested
this
beer
would
bringdry
acetic
wine
notes
laced
with
cherry
tartness
and
wooden
funk
my
only
qualm
is
the
mouthfeel
as
i
feel
that
a
tighter
creamier
carbonation
level
would
allow
this
beer
to
explore
the
palate
a
bit
longer
still
my
nitpick
is
a
minor
one
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
ale
and
an
essential
representative
of
the
style
supplication
is
a
good
wild
ale
not
overly
sour
or
sweet
but
very
approachable
o
4
5
overall
this
is
a
remarkable
beer
this
has
been
staring
at
me
from
my
fridge
for
a
while
and
its
been
well
worth
the
wait
ive
had
a
few
wilds
but
this
one
sets
the
bar
quite
high
o
truly
a
good
beer
delicate
comes
to
mind
its
not
too
overthetop
or
inyourface
like
other
brett
sours
the
barrel
aging
and
cherries
are
a
perfect
combination
this
is
another
beer
that
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
mahogany
with
small
particles
floating
in
the
beer
the
beer
itself
is
topped
off
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
around
the
center
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
complex
tobacco
plums
raisins
figs
tart
cherries
and
currants
the
lactic
aroma
is
more
subtle
then
other
rr
beers
peaking
through
the
other
aromas
is
a
bit
of
funk
but
not
a
pronounced
amount
of
funk
the
flavor
is
just
as
complex
as
the
aroma
figs
plums
raisins
and
cherries
with
sour
tones
the
carbonation
is
at
a
minimum
and
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
lingering
sour
finish
excellent
beer
and
something
i
would
definitely
seek
out
again
o
probably
in
my
top
5
american
sours
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
to
cellar
o
i
did
not
like
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
now
i
appreciate
the
sourness
i
love
rr
for
the
high
ibu
beers
and
this
beer
brings
something
different
to
the
table
o
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
overall
i
remember
this
being
better
on
tap
at
extreme
beer
fest
a
couple
years
ago
that
said
in
the
bottle
this
is
still
excellent
very
sour
yet
not
as
sour
as
most
i
have
had
from
cantillon
i
could
drink
several
glasses
of
this
if
i
could
find
it
one
of
my
favorites
from
russian
river
o
one
of
the
best
american
wild
ales
ive
had
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
had
you
gotta
enjoy
sours
to
like
this
one
not
a
big
fan
opens
with
a
tart
snap
of
cider
and
biscuity
malt
flavors
active
prickly
carbonation
throughout
moves
into
a
balsamic
vinegar
middle
with
hints
of
wild
yeast
and
sour
cherries
puckering
mouthfeel
sharp
hop
presence
emerges
before
reverting
to
mild
malt
sweetness
finishes
dry
with
a
touch
of
wood
smoke
so
very
sessionable
many
regrets
that
i
had
time
for
only
one
then
again
there
was
no
more
to
be
had
what
a
beer
its
nearly
the
perfect
sour
sour
cherries
and
brett
funk
dominate
the
aroma
the
taste
is
so
complex
sour
cherries
tartness
sourness
oak
mouth
watering
red
sour
patch
kids
liquified
it
was
a
real
challenge
for
me
to
work
through
a
bottle
of
supplication
it
is
so
good
but
it
made
my
mouth
work
too
damn
hard
too
much
salivating
and
puckering
that
can
be
taken
as
a
tongueincheek
compliment
but
it
is
also
its
only
detracting
quality
i
cant
sit
and
drink
bottle
after
bottle
of
this
my
mouth
would
not
survive
sourness
and
oak
both
very
measured
and
not
much
funk
more
balanced
rounded
and
nuanced
than
any
kriek
not
my
thing
but
a
stunner
just
the
same
overall
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
which
isnt
saying
a
ton
but
i
have
been
lucky
to
sample
a
few
russian
river
sours
in
the
past
in
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
one
pours
clear
copper
color
with
some
whispy
white
head
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
ridiculously
good
sweet
cherry
and
loads
of
oak
and
spice
some
brett
taste
is
more
fruit
forward
red
fruit
like
cherry
brett
lacto
just
a
little
oak
with
some
mild
bright
acidity
the
oak
aroma
is
huge
compared
with
the
taste
medium
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
very
drinkable
wild
ale
the
tartness
is
really
mild
i
love
the
pinot
my
favorite
wine
characteristics
that
come
through
ive
had
this
on
tap
numerous
times
and
never
enjoyed
it
this
much
o
this
is
pretty
delicious
as
it
warmed
sat
for
a
while
i
got
more
of
the
oak
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
flavor
its
pretty
complex
and
just
damn
good
only
complaint
was
the
price
and
of
course
i
had
to
drive
to
philly
to
pick
it
up
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
dry
finish
that
doesnt
turn
me
off
like
some
beers
i
have
recently
tasted
not
much
sweet
which
i
found
very
inviting
for
this
beer
this
is
a
favorite
beer
of
mine
and
has
remained
very
close
to
what
i
remember
from
before
i
consider
this
to
be
my
current
benchmark
of
the
american
wild
ale
category
o
absolutely
amazing
sour
my
first
rr
beer
too
this
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
raisin
color
with
great
carbonation
and
just
a
thin
head
there
is
an
immediate
oak
and
banana
aroma
the
beer
has
a
clear
tart
beginning
that
quickly
gives
way
to
fermented
fruit
you
notice
the
wine
barrel
aging
at
the
back
of
a
sip
cherry
tartness
is
not
overly
sour
and
well
balanced
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
really
enhances
the
mouthfeel
all
in
all
a
excellent
wild
ale
overall
supplication
is
surprisingly
refreshing
and
complex
truly
a
worldclass
beer
doa
o
outstanding
beer
i
could
honestly
drink
this
everyday
its
tartsour
enough
but
displays
the
beautiful
notes
that
fruit
and
pinot
noir
can
add
to
this
style
beautifully
sour
but
drinkable
beyond
belief
id
recommend
this
beer
as
the
best
american
wild
that
ive
tried
overall
wild
ales
are
growing
on
me
and
seem
to
get
better
with
each
one
i
have
and
each
bbf
i
volunteer
for
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fests
i
would
have
very
little
knowledge
or
experience
with
these
sour
and
funky
beer
i
am
happy
to
have
brought
this
back
safely
from
denver
and
to
start
off
the
new
year
in
boston
on
a
good
note
pours
out
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
half
finger
of
light
brown
head
that
fizzled
out
as
quick
as
it
formed
smell
and
taste
are
both
very
tart
and
sour
sour
cherries
lead
the
charge
and
are
quickly
followed
up
with
flavors
of
wine
and
yeast
nice
tart
earthy
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
lively
with
excellent
carbonation
tickling
the
tongue
a
medium
weight
body
compliments
this
beer
perfectly
a
nice
dry
tart
finish
doesnt
linger
long
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
everyone
should
have
the
opportunity
to
try
overall
just
a
fantastic
beer
and
drinking
experience
its
got
the
flavours
found
in
a
average
sour
but
there
is
also
a
level
of
complexity
that
keeps
it
interesting
throughout
im
happy
i
picked
this
one
for
review
1000
and
im
looking
forward
to
the
next
1000
beers
happy
2012
ba
o
a
great
sour
really
deserves
all
the
accolades
more
bitter
than
sweet
and
finishes
nice
and
dry
a
real
treat
to
get
to
try
this
finally
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
its
drinkability
comes
from
sour
cherries
that
are
just
powerful
enough
to
hide
the
alcohol
but
not
strong
enough
to
shock
the
palate
overall
a
nice
sour
although
outclassed
by
cantillon
or
3
fonteinen
for
obvious
reason
from
a
microbiological
point
of
view
the
balance
and
complexity
of
artificial
inoculated
sours
is
always
much
lower
compared
to
the
real
airinoculated
belgium
sours
but
besides
that
this
is
the
best
of
the
rest
fantastic
beer
and
a
huge
thanks
to
ales4blado
for
this
in
a
trade
o
top
tier
sour
with
lots
of
complexity
and
great
sourness
another
great
sour
from
russian
river
it
is
the
most
amazing
rich
ruby
red
it
smells
like
sour
cherries
the
taste
is
cherries
and
a
slight
grapey
twist
like
wine
very
complex
citrus
and
sour
cherry
characteristics
from
the
brett
and
its
friends
this
is
the
best
american
wild
ale
i
have
ever
tasted
not
that
my
experience
is
extensive
overall
this
was
a
delicious
beer
once
this
beer
has
a
chance
to
open
up
it
really
blossoms
into
a
complex
treat
o
top
notch
vinnie
and
russian
river
know
how
to
make
an
outstanding
beer
the
pinot
noir
barrels
and
cherries
really
bring
something
special
to
this
beer
not
just
one
of
my
favorite
sours
but
one
of
my
beers
period
this
one
is
not
for
someone
trying
to
break
into
sours
but
an
absolute
must
try
for
someone
who
appreciates
the
style
i
just
wish
this
beer
wasnt
so
expensive
just
starting
out
with
this
style
of
beer
but
supplication
will
be
hard
to
beat
a
must
try
o
very
impressed
after
it
warmed
up
i
was
able
to
get
some
great
oak
aroma
obviously
i
love
sours
or
else
i
wouldnt
have
bought
it
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
well
balanced
sours
ive
ever
had
amazing
oak
aroma
semisweet
and
tart
body
and
dry
lingering
aftertaste
its
just
perfect
overall
the
beer
is
okay
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
sours
so
it
is
hard
to
rate
it
against
other
beers
in
its
style
however
as
a
beer
for
special
occasion
it
will
not
stand
out
in
my
memory
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
beers
that
i
have
had
great
sour
experience
from
rr
very
balanced
and
yet
in
your
face
at
the
same
time
overall
really
spectacular
i
dont
get
to
drink
many
sours
as
good
as
this
one
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
beatification
in
my
cellar
it
tempts
me
every
day
is
there
anything
russian
river
doesnt
do
well
all
in
all
another
great
russian
river
experience
and
a
very
satisfied
customer
sours
are
definitely
an
acquired
taste
but
this
is
among
the
best
of
the
best
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
imo
wow
if
you
have
had
santification
or
consecration
this
beer
is
similar
but
way
better
than
both
if
you
have
the
money
buy
at
least
one
and
enjoy
i
paid
17
per
bottle
from
pinnochios
beer
garden
in
media
pa
well
worth
the
buy
i
offered
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
hates
all
craft
beers
because
he
is
not
open
to
the
big
taste
but
he
was
blown
away
by
this
one
i
acquired
this
one
in
a
trade
from
solomongrundy
awesome
trader
thanks
again
poured
from
375
ml
bottle
into
a
chalice
it
pours
a
beautiful
pinkish
orange
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
very
tony
bubbles
of
carbonation
it
smells
of
sour
cherry
and
musty
yeast
mild
scent
of
oak
is
there
as
well
wow
very
tart
im
not
really
a
big
sour
fan
but
ive
had
a
few
and
have
begun
to
appreciate
the
style
lots
of
sour
cherry
and
wine
flavors
mild
oak
flavors
hang
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
palate
scrubber
it
will
obliterate
any
beer
youve
had
throughout
the
night
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
very
acidic
and
dry
tasty
but
just
not
my
favorite
style
final
thought
at
12
a
pop
and
a
nice
7
abv
this
is
a
great
beer
hard
to
find
at
times
but
if
you
do
find
one
buy
one
and
age
it
as
well
pours
a
hazy
light
copperruby
color
with
a
slightly
pink
off
white
head
cherry
and
oak
on
the
nose
with
potent
lactic
sourness
slight
earthiness
and
vanilla
on
the
aroma
as
well
this
batch
of
draft
is
not
as
intensely
sour
as
other
bottles
ive
had
cherries
are
a
little
fruiter
and
tart
and
overall
the
flavor
is
sweeter
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
it
is
what
it
is
dr
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
sourness
and
style
affordable
50
cents
per
sampler
i
think
overall
its
better
bottleconditioned
o
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
ill
always
want
more
and
always
gladly
will
drink
this
stuff
when
im
looking
for
my
sour
fix
typical
russian
river
d
dont
ever
not
drink
this
beer
5
o
a
beautiful
beer
such
a
clean
sour
ale
and
done
with
such
a
new
world
style
i
love
this
beer
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
o
a
great
uncompromising
sour
this
beer
is
world
class
perfect
amount
of
tartness
and
i
am
a
sucker
for
cherry
beers
really
a
top
notch
sour
this
could
almost
go
for
a
flanders
red
tons
of
sour
lemons
wine
cherries
the
perfect
amount
of
funk
whats
not
to
love
like
i
said
what
else
can
you
say
about
supplication
or
russian
river
as
it
is
theyre
super
hyped
and
deserve
that
hype
supplication
is
probably
the
best
american
wild
ale
in
existence
i
need
to
buy
this
by
the
case
so
in
love
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
exceptionally
well
made
get
some
if
you
can
thanks
to
david131
for
the
bottle
do
drinkability
is
high
this
is
one
of
the
best
russian
river
sours
ive
had
and
part
of
that
has
to
do
with
how
complex
and
smooth
it
all
is
its
easy
to
distinguish
the
fruit
the
barrel
and
the
bugs
that
went
into
making
this
and
the
final
result
is
a
delicious
sipper
that
i
am
thankful
for
the
palate
has
no
indication
of
aging
in
my
opinion
except
for
maybe
this
beer
would
more
tart
if
it
wasnt
aged
pours
out
a
semi
murky
brown
tinged
amber
no
head
yet
paradoxically
has
a
semi
spritzey
carbonation
as
also
typical
in
a
great
sour
the
wine
aroma
really
does
come
through
on
the
nose
full
of
bold
fruity
sour
cherry
character
on
a
base
of
tannic
wood
aroma
just
about
everything
i
want
out
of
a
sour
nose
all
at
once
somehow
delivered
without
being
cloying
or
overwhelming
at
all
i
think
i
may
be
seeing
why
this
beer
has
developed
such
a
cult
following
tastes
of
sour
candied
cherries
and
than
everything
i
experienced
within
the
nose
coming
at
me
just
like
clockwork
in
exactly
the
same
order
only
difference
being
that
the
pucker
of
the
acidity
fades
out
only
to
be
replaced
by
the
wood
tones
accentuated
in
the
finish
very
much
on
the
gentler
yet
paradoxically
also
the
drier
side
of
most
wild
ales
that
i
have
sampled
as
of
this
date
the
body
is
medium
thick
and
not
as
astringent
as
it
could
have
been
job
well
done
i
hate
to
validate
all
the
rr
boobs
out
there
but
this
is
a
great
beer
really
enjoyed
this
at
this
price
i
could
not
drink
supplication
daily
without
liquidating
my
401k
but
i
will
seek
out
other
rr
wilds
and
would
periodically
by
supplication
again
cheers
head
dissipated
quickly
the
nose
is
incredible
funk
and
cherries
the
cherries
return
in
the
taste
along
with
a
faint
oak
turning
tart
and
finishing
dry
and
almost
sweet
its
amazing
how
the
cherries
persist
throughout
without
being
over
the
top
like
a
lindemans
the
effervescence
sends
the
beer
across
my
tongue
but
dries
out
quickly
to
leave
just
a
hint
of
cherries
this
is
an
amazing
beer
nuanced
and
tasty
poured
slowly
from
a
375ml
bottle
and
left
the
sediment
in
the
bottom
it
poured
a
dark
cloudy
orange
with
a
perfect
head
smells
of
cherries
obviously
the
first
taste
if
of
cherries
followed
by
sour
the
sour
is
not
overdone
quite
a
nice
brew
and
if
you
like
sour
cherries
its
worth
seeking
out
on
tap
poured
into
a
10oz
goblet
pours
a
reddish
amber
in
color
with
no
head
whatsoever
and
no
sediment
smell
is
faint
but
of
mild
vinegar
and
sweetness
taste
is
of
potent
vinegar
and
oaky
vanilla
a
little
bit
of
cherry
coming
through
not
much
tho
not
much
lingering
at
all
love
sours
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
thanks
baldo
conclusion
not
what
i
expected
but
very
tasty
and
complex
i
always
thought
this
would
be
more
sour
and
singular
with
bracing
sourness
and
a
real
smack
of
cherries
instead
it
is
softer
and
presents
its
flavor
profile
a
gentle
touch
the
flavors
are
defined
and
layered
and
overall
this
is
just
a
great
beer
overall
i
have
had
this
many
times
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
from
various
batches
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
would
have
it
in
my
top
10
or
so
of
beers
of
all
time
i
feel
that
this
beer
has
a
more
sour
aspect
to
it
in
the
bottle
and
is
more
carbonated
than
when
served
on
tap
one
of
my
favorites
so
its
nice
to
always
have
this
around
in
bottle
and
also
to
get
it
on
tap
for
only
6
75
at
the
brewery
if
you
havent
had
this
beer
make
sure
you
try
some
appearance
is
a
red
brown
body
with
a
small
tan
head
its
nose
contains
cherry
red
wine
and
a
general
sourness
supplication
has
a
taste
of
of
more
cherries
sour
apple
funk
and
some
oak
the
mouthfeel
of
it
has
some
life
to
it
a
very
nice
crispness
it
really
has
a
certain
winechampagne
quality
to
it
this
was
another
very
good
wild
from
rr
when
i
find
myself
in
philly
its
always
a
treat
to
try
something
from
this
brewery
overall
it
was
enjoyable
the
sourness
is
strong
but
not
too
much
any
more
sour
and
i
would
have
had
problems
i
think
the
winenote
crossover
is
done
well
but
i
still
dont
like
spending
10
on
a
small
bottle
because
of
the
price
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
in
ca
its
nice
to
have
once
though
whole
foods
has
supplication
redemption
and
damnation
on
shelfs
now
overall
this
is
the
standard
cherrywine
sour
that
i
gauge
all
others
of
similar
type
this
ones
nearly
flawless
o
this
is
the
first
sour
ive
tasted
that
really
blew
my
palate
apart
im
hard
pressed
to
try
and
find
something
more
intense
than
this
this
beer
is
a
game
changer
great
offering
from
rr
i
dont
know
how
often
ill
buy
this
one
as
it
costs
nearly
15
bucks
a
bottle
on
the
east
coast
but
definitely
worth
a
try
o
as
good
as
a
sour
gets
must
try
recommendation
to
me
this
is
a
super
funky
beer
though
i
must
admit
not
as
groundbreaking
as
i
had
built
it
up
to
be
maybe
i
dont
know
sours
enough
to
appreciate
the
nuance
but
i
can
appreciate
the
care
taken
to
craft
it
and
balance
it
its
sour
but
not
too
sour
complimentarily
oaked
and
definitely
quality
o
a
great
sour
starting
to
warm
up
to
the
style
special
thanks
to
chowdahead
for
sharing
this
one
cellared
for
a
year
then
poured
into
a
snifter
reddish
brown
in
color
not
much
head
or
lacing
nose
is
tart
cherries
apple
and
some
sweet
sugary
notes
taste
is
mix
of
tart
cherry
and
sour
apple
with
a
little
brown
sugar
in
the
mix
never
thought
i
would
become
a
fan
of
sours
but
the
allagash
releases
got
me
hooked
and
this
one
takes
the
cake
as
my
favorite
thus
far
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
not
overly
sour
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
sours
from
russian
river
top
notch
poured
a
crimson
cherrywood
color
with
a
creamy
cap
of
offwhite
head
that
left
a
bit
of
streaky
lacing
on
the
tulip
glass
the
head
dissipated
mostly
but
left
a
ubiquitous
ringlet
of
delicate
bubbles
behind
tart
aroma
rich
with
various
indistinct
fruits
and
classic
brettness
woody
with
some
nice
funk
incredibly
complex
taste
starts
out
tart
and
sour
with
notes
of
cherries
cranberries
lemons
and
white
wine
mellows
out
midpalate
with
a
distinct
mustiness
that
allows
the
woody
characters
to
come
out
then
a
fruity
reprise
in
the
end
with
dried
cherries
and
dried
pineapple
for
a
solid
crisp
finish
not
heavy
in
the
mouthfeel
but
definitely
full
on
the
palate
beautifully
crafted
and
highly
drinkable
cheers
this
is
a
greattasting
and
complex
beera
good
twist
on
the
usual
belgian
sour
i
will
certainly
have
this
again
when
i
can
get
it
id
like
to
try
on
older
batch
or
age
one
for
a
while
overall
damn
good
beer
as
a
nonsourabouttogetintosour
fan
this
is
a
great
intro
into
sours
consecration
and
temptation
was
too
much
for
me
but
this
was
good
4
55
overall
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
sour
i
have
had
to
date
the
added
dimension
from
the
pinot
and
the
balance
will
be
hard
to
be
topped
by
another
sour
in
my
opinion
overalla
good
solid
sour
ale
for
sure
i
would
drink
it
again
and
look
forward
to
aging
one
much
longer
probably
around
6
months
to
a
year
i
guess
i
wouldnt
mind
if
it
was
a
little
less
sour
but
its
still
really
good
glad
i
encouraged
myself
to
try
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
fuck
of
a
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
russian
river
please
be
sure
to
drink
this
at
the
proper
temperature
minimum
of
55f
to
let
all
the
flavors
emerge
overall
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
if
havent
had
it
it
is
worth
the
i
vestment
pours
a
hazy
copper
hue
no
head
nice
scents
of
tart
cherries
with
a
faint
sweet
smell
notes
of
red
wine
are
present
in
the
aroma
too
and
compliment
the
tartness
nicely
big
but
tame
tartness
with
a
decent
acidic
flavor
after
letting
this
sit
and
stir
for
a
while
the
sweeter
notes
come
to
the
front
dark
cherries
diacetyl
hints
of
dry
red
wine
the
carbonation
definite
helps
the
tartness
of
the
brew
it
makes
it
sharper
noticeable
notes
of
brett
and
diacetyl
for
a
buttery
yet
funky
finish
the
beers
medium
body
definitely
helps
your
palate
deal
with
the
tartness
and
the
acidity
nicely
so
that
you
can
enjoy
the
complexity
rather
than
focus
on
how
funky
it
is
top
notch
very
well
balanced
i
like
the
american
craftbrewing
tendency
of
the
higherquality
the
beer
the
more
they
want
to
tell
you
about
it
on
the
packaging
knowing
what
went
into
this
offering
makes
it
all
the
more
enjoyable
the
sourness
yeast
wood
funk
oh
and
actual
beer
too
all
kept
in
balance
yet
still
rendering
a
beverage
for
the
adventurous
palate
sort
of
a
more
laidback
cantillon
scary
earthrelationshipaffirming
and
ultimately
tasty
overall
this
brew
is
another
great
sour
from
russian
river
crisp
tart
and
full
of
flavors
boom
im
lovin
it
im
beginning
to
fall
in
love
with
sours
this
beer
was
a
huge
hit
in
my
book
such
a
great
beer
that
i
could
stock
my
fridge
with
if
it
was
available
here
thanks
again
dave
for
this
awesome
brew
this
is
my
single
favorite
wild
ale
to
date
the
tartness
is
not
overpowering
but
instead
mingles
with
the
fruit
and
malt
to
allow
for
a
high
level
of
complexity
very
recommended
o
a
the
beer
does
go
down
pretty
easy
but
it
is
quite
sour
might
not
be
something
you
would
have
more
than
one
or
two
servings
of
not
sure
how
this
is
a
brown
ale
because
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
one
nice
tart
cherry
smell
with
some
date
and
fig
notes
its
almost
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
blended
with
a
brown
aleadding
some
fruit
and
sour
tartness
along
with
it
incredibly
complex
and
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
sours
ive
had
even
from
rr
i
have
about
4
of
these
ive
stowed
away
now
anxious
to
see
how
they
change
over
time
i
would
highly
recommend
picking
some
up
if
you
can
o
this
was
a
winner
in
my
book
very
well
balanced
between
funk
and
sour
and
the
subtle
sweetness
really
rounded
it
out
o
thought
this
was
great
but
well
below
the
quality
of
authentic
belgians
ive
had
well
balanced
with
a
bit
of
a
strange
aftertaste
i
would
get
it
again
no
doubt
i
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
less
funk
and
a
bit
more
cherry
overall
i
have
found
a
style
of
beer
that
i
have
zero
interest
in
exploring
i
imagine
that
some
beer
geeks
out
there
will
love
this
but
for
me
a
sour
ale
is
just
not
something
ill
ever
want
the
flavor
is
decent
but
not
all
too
complex
and
it
is
not
very
refreshing
at
all
either
glad
i
tried
the
best
of
the
sour
ales
before
i
wasted
my
time
with
any
other
ones
this
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
lots
of
interesting
flavors
and
as
someone
looking
to
branch
out
and
try
new
things
this
is
great
give
it
a
shot
if
you
can
i
doubt
youll
be
disappointed
drink
and
overall
fantastic
beer
a
real
nice
treat
that
i
will
seek
out
again
in
the
future
ive
had
enough
to
know
its
worth
its
weight
in
shipping
my
mouth
has
a
great
lasting
flavor
that
i

drinkability

overall
impression

found
this
one
quite
drinkable
in
that
each
sip
was
easy
to
take
and
easily
followed
the
preceding
one
if
you
are
looking
for
one
word
to
describe
this
beer
think
complexity
this
is
a
beer
that
deserves
its
reputation
and
overall
is
an
excellent
beer
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
bottles
of
this
one
age
over
the
next
few
years
in
the
end
not
something
to
drink
everyday
but
definitely
a
special
treat
that
i
would
love
goretudn
to
often
o
wow
im
just
dumbstruck
with
how
good
this
is
its
as
close
to
perfect
as
ive
had
o
overall
supplication
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
russian
river
this
beer
is
never
disappointing
and
the
hype
around
it
is
justified
i
seek
this
out
regularly
every
month
or
so
thanks
vinnie
for
sending
this
awesome
beer
to
philly
4
5
pours
a
nice
dark
cherry
color
w
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
disappears
to
a
sliver
very
cloudy
and
alive
looking
brew
good
carbonation
and
decent
lacing
awesome
looking
wild
ale
wow
the
nose
is
fantastic
cherry
funk
some
brown
sugar
caramel
sourness
a
hint
of
candy
sweetness
really
complex
and
nice
opens
up
really
nicely
with
warmingairing
out
now
on
to
the
taste
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
nose
minus
the
candy
sweetness
its
really
not
too
sour
just
about
right
it
seems
like
the
taste
just
keeps
evolving
the
more
you
get
into
it
definitely
some
wineoakvinegar
in
the
taste
as
well
none
of
the
7
abv
is
evident
at
all
very
carbonated
and
dry
finish
on
this
beer
a
little
too
carbonated
otherwise
a
higher
score
overall
this
is
a
top
flight
wild
ale
i
like
consecration
a
little
better
but
this
is
highly
recommended
cheers
d
375ml
split
two
ways
is
simply
not
enough
russian
river
delivers
once
again
now
if
only
theyd
ship
to
nyc
d
this
is
a
really
nice
complex
brew
from
rr
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
didnt
wow
me
as
much
as
i
was
hoping
for
it
is
almost
like
a
more
complex
consecration
but
not
as
powerful
that
being
said
this
was
an
awesome
beer
i
just
think
it
falls
a
little
short
of
other
wild
ales
i
have
had
and
other
rr
brews
for
that
matter
highly
recommended
batch
006x2
corked
popped
off
with
force
pours
a
nice
ruby
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
and
tart
cherries
with
great
vanilla
cream
although
this
one
has
a
much
more
subtle
aroma
i
really
like
the
vanilla
and
wine
grape
the
beer
is
a
very
mouth
puckering
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
delight
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
or
dry
with
a
lingering
fruit
finish
very
nice
i
wish
i
could
get
ahold
of
more
russian
river
beers
o
very
hard
to
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
the
nose
is
a
bit
boozy
for
some
reason
but
it
really
is
a
world
class
beer
it
delivers
outstanding
flavors
and
each
batch
seems
to
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
o
solid
4
5s
o
an
amazing
beer
from
russian
river
the
super
tart
cherry
flavors
and
prickly
carbonation
make
this
a
joy
to
drink
possibly
my
favorite
sour
from
rr
o
such
a
nice
notoverthetop
sour
fruity
and
woody
and
delicate
and
funky
and
awesome
o
a
solid
brew
simple
but
complicated
worth
seeking
out
o
this
is
what
american
wild
is
all
about
nice
tartness
tons
of
depth
fruit
bugs
its
all
here
i
might
not
claim
this
to
be
my
favorite
beer
anymore
but
its
still
got
a
top
5
spot
an
awesome
beer
overall
this
one
was
lovely
out
of
this
compared
to
the
other
2
rr
wilds
ive
had
consecration
temptation
id
have
to
put
this
third
cheers
to
them
though
never
disappointed
will
definitely
get
again
and
again
o
this
is
the
sort
of
drink
that
should
come
to
mind
with
you
think
of
the
term
fine
beer
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
truly
a
lovely
beer
cherry
sours
are
my
favorite
sours
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
definitely
one
to
trade
for
regularly
definitely
not
as
stellar
as
lou
pepe
kriek
i
love
the
funk
but
awesome
for
an
american
wild
imo
overall
i
cannot
believe
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
try
my
first
supplication
this
is
everything
i
want
in
a
sour
i
will
be
coming
back
to
this
beer
again
and
again
overall
55
acceptional
tasty
offering
from
russian
river
o
currently
this
is
my
favorite
wild
ale
from
russian
river
i
have
been
lucky
enough
to
have
multiple
vintages
of
supplication
based
on
my
experience
the
vintages
are
very
consistent
and
age
well
for
several
years
batch
4
is
drinking
really
well
these
days
d
loaded
with
layers
upon
layers
of
complexity
in
every
facet
by
far
my
favorite
russian
river
tion
to
date
excellent
brew
and
a
challenge
to
even
the
most
developed
palette
d
as
i
said
earlier
i
will
need
time
to
warm
up
to
this
style
but
it
was
really
good
just
unusual
for
me
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
even
with
its
flaws
id
be
a
happy
happy
man
if
this
were
the
only
beer
id
ever
be
allowed
to
drink
for
all
i
know
all
they
serve
in
heaven
is
supplication
even
though
no
individual
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
best
in
show
its
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
to
drink
ever
this
beer
is
amazingly
complex
and
delicious
finally
a
sour
i
could
drink
every
day
and
it
has
to
be
one
thats
expensive
and
comes
nowhere
near
the
midwest
ive
got
another
coming
in
trade
and
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
a
good
sour
that
comes
together
nicely
but
i
probably
should
have
let
it
age
a
little
longer
to
help
the
flavor
really
come
out
mouthfeel
very
light
body
great
carbonation
a
bit
puckering
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
ever
since
i
had
this
with
my
friends
at
rr
its
been
on
of
those
beers
for
us
wish
it
was
cheaper
and
easier
to
find
but
ill
take
what
i
can
get
overallif
this
were
available
in
tx
and
not
so
expensive
i
would
drink
one
every
night
the
sour
and
tartness
of
this
beer
did
not
fright
me
off
like
others
sours
ive
tried
crazy
drinkable
if
you
can
get
this
beer
and
havent
tried
it
yet
go
get
it
now
this
is
a
terrific
beer
that
has
aged
tremendously
id
have
to
say
its
my
most
successful
cellaring
experience
to
date
pours
a
light
amberbrown
the
nose
is
big
cherries
a
yeastiness
red
wine
grapes
and
a
bit
of
straw
funkiness
the
cherries
and
the
funkiness
come
together
in
a
slightly
medicinal
way
sour
tart
cherries
dominant
the
taste
intermingled
with
red
wine
that
yeastiness
a
touch
of
grape
and
that
straw
funkiness
the
body
is
medium
but
the
carbonation
is
quite
high
though
it
works
this
isnt
my
favorite
wild
though
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
that
is
readily
available
everyone
else
liked
it
better
than
i
did
but
that
is
not
uncommon
for
wilds
solid
a
really
great
wild
ale
with
a
nicely
balanced
and
complex
fruity
flavour
well
built
and
a
damn
fine
ale
this
beer
is
truly
incredible
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
had
this
in
a
bottle
in
oregon
it
was
fairly
cool
bottle
and
had
the
taste
of
eating
a
dark
freash
cherry
without
the
pit
you
do
get
a
hint
of
the
p
n
wine
barrel
this
was
an
easy
drinking
sour
i
would
recommend
it
for
the
ladies
paired
with
cheeses
overall
another
nice
sour
from
rr
o
i
still
love
this
beer
and
it
only
seems
to
get
better
with
age
i
just
wonder
how
long
it
can
go
for
if
this
one
is
any
indication
i
would
say
quite
awhile
o
reading
over
my
review
i
keep
thinking
it
sounds
like
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
one
i
did
i
always
do
it
was
different
than
other
bottles
ive
had
which
is
of
course
to
be
expected
its
not
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
but
its
an
extremely
enjoyable
one
that
fully
deserves
the
praise
it
gets
it
really
was
a
nice
contrast
to
dinner
and
im
hoping
itll
do
some
great
things
to
my
conditioning
beer
dark
mahogany
almost
brownred
like
the
others
the
head
is
thin
and
bubbly
smell
is
pretty
fruity
cherry
almost
brown
sugar
taste
is
nutmeg
brown
sugar
cherries
definitely
strong
cherries
very
tasty
smooth
easy
drinker
not
too
heavy
at
all
overall
i
dug
it
in
the
sidebyside
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
with
lingering
aroma
that
you
can
smell
in
your
mouth
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
one
of
a
kind
i
would
love
to
have
another
some
day
but
not
sure
id
have
more
than
one
in
any
given
sitting
so
i
cant
say
its
the
most
drinkable
beer
o
much
better
sour
than
others
ive
tried
the
sourness
is
there
but
doesnt
overwhelm
you
in
any
way
the
cherries
set
it
off
just
enough
o
this
is
quite
a
beer
tons
of
flavor
and
a
nice
sourness
that
is
a
staple
of
many
russian
river
brews
overall
a
fantastic
balanced
approachable
wild
ale
lots
to
contemplate
barnyard
character
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
aroma
presents
a
cherrylike
sweetness
while
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
tart
overall
i
highly
recommend
this
one
for
both
the
sour
novice
whos
trying
to
expose
their
palate
to
these
types
of
beers
and
also
for
the
aficionado
o
really
solid
sour
not
something
i
would
consider
a
session
choice
but
very
interesting
excellent
with
food
and
a
something
i
would
spend
the
money
on
again
in
the
future
oa
great
well
balanced
sour
looking
forward
to
temptation
but
it
was
better
than
consecration
d
this
is
an
excellent
teeth
chattering
sour
beer
but
something
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
like
drinking
a
dry
expensive
champagne
without
the
bubbles
yes
theres
a
reason
objectively
that
there
is
so
much
hype
surrounding
rr
but
you
can
pay
2
dollars
more
for
a
750ml
of
jolly
pumpkin
and
support
a
smaller
stillgrowing
independent
producer
that
makes
a
beer
thats
almost
as
good
in
a
very
similar
style
sampled
at
rbwg
2010
from
a
375ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
huge
oak
and
belgian
yeast
with
definite
tartness
and
touches
of
brett
and
lacto
for
sure
the
flavor
is
big
sour
plenty
tart
with
citrus
and
so
much
more
the
oak
presents
itself
more
subtley
than
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
brett
presence
as
well
awesome
stuff
overall
i
must
honestly
say
it
took
me
awhile
to
grow
accustomed
to
it
and
it
was
a
bit
difficult
but
worth
the
effort
a
truly
well
made
beer
pours
a
darkish
amberbrown
with
a
thin
amount
of
head
the
aroma
right
away
is
sour
cherries
followed
by
oak
and
some
funk
the
flavor
is
very
complex
there
is
sour
tart
cherries
and
brett
with
oak
and
wine
there
is
also
vinegar
but
not
too
much
its
pretty
sour
on
the
palate
but
not
overpowering
making
this
an
enjoyable
beer
o
great
beer
will
always
get
it
when
i
see
it
pours
a
nice
light
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
aromas
of
tart
cherries
oak
and
funkiness
taste
was
nothing
short
of
amazing
tart
dry
and
refreshing
medium
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
make
the
sourness
pop
a
fantastic
example
of
how
a
sour
beer
should
be
done
if
i
had
access
to
this
all
the
time
i
could
see
it
being
a
regular
offering
in
my
fridge
ruby
colored
with
fruity
notes
that
are
both
vibrant
and
delicately
mixed
theres
no
unpleasant
sharpness
challenging
or
harming
the
taste
likewise
the
carbonation
is
just
active
enough
to
bring
out
the
subtler
notes
that
might
otherwise
be
lost
smooth
and
downright
delicious
i
cant
wait
to
find
this
one
on
tap
curious
how
it
would
compare
to
that
fresh
lou
pepe
2008
i
just
had
i
first
tried
supplication
this
february
when
i
split
a
375
with
a
good
friend
tonight
i
was
more
than
eager
to
polish
off
a
little
bottle
on
my
own
i
will
crush
a
750
before
the
summer
is
over
i
had
this
batch
when
it
was
fresh
and
it
has
aged
wonderfully
i
have
had
a
bottle
of
the
batch
2
every
year
since
it
was
released
and
it
never
fails
to
satisfy
great
stuff
o
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
very
drinkable
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
while
sitting
on
the
back
porch
or
anytime
actually
bottle
courtesy
of
grg1313
batch
04x04
served
in
my
cl
tulip
at
53
degrees
pours
a
pleasant
caramel
hue
with
a
slightly
hazy
clarity
and
a
one
inch
dense
and
creamy
offwhite
head
embedded
with
tiny
ringlets
textured
bands
of
lacing
are
revealed
as
the
brew
recedes
nose
expresses
tart
cherries
a
buttery
quality
and
a
trace
of
american
oak
cherry
is
much
more
muted
in
the
flavor
profile
there
is
also
a
vinegary
and
citrus
character
dispersed
throughout
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
bright
lively
carbonation
some
acidity
that
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
and
a
semidry
finish
this
is
a
solid
american
wild
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewer
but
quite
complex
and
refreshing
this
is
definitely
one
to
be
sipped
and
savored
contemplated
another
home
run
from
russian
river
overall
another
nice
sour
offering
from
russian
river
although
this
one
is
pretty
straight
forward
sour
cherries
on
oak
its
nice
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
wild
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
good
stuff
overall
great
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
some
slight
burgandy
tints
and
nice
foamy
throughout
the
session
a
lot
of
floaties
but
good
nice
funk
in
the
aroma
with
some
cherries
raspberries
and
winelike
whiffs
nice
tough
on
the
esophogus
after
each
sip
for
me
right
to
the
finish
tart
but
not
overly
distracting
some
cherries
and
more
tart
fruit
in
the
taste
nice
dry
and
clean
finish
salivation
on
the
buds
after
each
sip
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
wild
ale
and
a
great
starter
if
someone
is
looking
to
try
the
style
not
overly
sour
and
pleasant
to
sip
o
with
the
mythical
proportions
that
russian
river
has
ascended
to
i
guess
i
set
the
bar
too
high
and
ended
up
disappointed
all
of
this
gibberish
about
this
brew
proving
beer
had
no
limits
and
is
an
american
national
treasure
overhyped
this
to
an
absurd
level
sure
it
was
a
good
beer
but
it
is
not
the
second
coming
of
christ
in
beer
form
like
a
lot
of
people
on
ba
seem
to
believe
it
also
doesnt
help
that
this
beer
cost
12
american
i
will
say
try
it
if
youre
feeling
indulgent
but
dont
invest
in
the
hype
o
russian
river
has
cemented
its
reputation
as
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
producer
of
american
wild
ales
period
i
tried
not
to
judge
this
brew
against
my
preferred
vehicle
of
sour
beers
flanders
reds
and
consider
it
within
the
parameters
of
its
style
personal
preference
aside
this
was
a
masterfully
brewed
beer
that
is
positively
bursting
with
originality
and
flavor
overall
oh
where
have
you
been
all
my
life
now
i
have
a
ways
to
go
in
terms
of
wilds
lambics
and
guezes
i
have
had
several
in
my
time
i
still
need
to
try
all
sorts
of
beers
yet
to
qualify
as
some
sort
of
sour
expert
however
with
that
written
i
must
state
this
plainly
as
i
can
this
is
the
best
wild
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
one
of
the
top
5
beers
i
have
ever
had
o
intriguing
clean
yet
complex
sour
flavors
and
dry
finish
beckon
you
to
keep
sipping
i
felt
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
challenge
for
me
to
get
down
since
im
not
a
big
fan
of
sour
ales
if
this
wasnt
a
russian
river
brew
i
probably
would
have
just
overlooked
it
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
sparkling
red
color
with
some
in
there
too
the
head
was
fizzy
and
white
and
then
vanished
pretty
quickly
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
big
its
stung
the
nostrils
like
sex
panther
a
little
bit
the
smell
of
tart
cherries
and
oak
wood
mixed
with
a
big
amount
of
wild
yeast
explode
on
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
interesting
too
the
sour
cherries
almost
make
your
lips
pucker
the
sour
subsides
and
leaves
you
with
a
nice
oak
and
vanilla
smoothness
the
mouthfeel
is
little
thin
but
has
enough
flavor
to
balance
out
the
whole
thing
overall
its
a
good
sour
beer
im
trying
to
give
it
praise
despite
the
fact
i
dont
care
for
the
style
i
feel
that
people
who
enjoy
these
will
definitely
enjoy
this
one
too
owell
this
is
almost
perfect
this
is
an
absolutely
and
amazing
and
unique
beer
i
love
it
so
much
id
like
the
initial
hit
to
be
more
powerful
but
the
aftertaste
is
so
strong
and
long
lasting
its
definitely
very
dry
i
would
recommend
this
to
sour
lovers
and
non
believers
alike
o
a
worth
25
bucks
ooverall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
wished
the
cherry
flavor
was
just
alittle
more
prominate
i
think
santification
is
still
alittle
better
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
trade
for
this
brew
again
overall
a
superb
sour
i
can
pick
out
the
cherries
and
the
pinot
noir
barrel
aging
fairly
easily
its
not
as
funky
as
some
others
which
is
fine
because
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
definitely
seek
out
rr
beers
if
you
can
o
this
is
an
amazing
sour
absolutely
surpassed
my
expectations
out
of
all
the
tions
from
russian
river
that
ive
tried
this
takes
the
cake
now
to
hunt
down
some
more
bottles
pours
bright
brown
with
a
medium
sized
head
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
visible
carbonation
smell
is
yeasty
big
cherries
taste
has
a
big
hit
of
tartness
up
front
balanced
with
just
a
touch
of
background
sweetness
sour
cherries
are
very
noticeable
but
dont
totally
dominate
the
flavor
puckering
tartness
ends
with
a
dry
hit
of
bitterness
tons
of
flavors
all
over
the
place
oak
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
lots
of
barnyard
yeastiness
the
wild
strains
are
obvious
although
its
hard
for
me
to
describe
the
flavors
they
contribute
except
for
some
sourness
since
ive
had
very
few
wild
beers
great
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
full
to
medium
bodied
crisp
with
a
lip
smacking
tart
and
dryish
finish
great
tart
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
is
pretty
great
stuff
i
paid
a
lot
for
it
but
im
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
and
will
check
out
the
rest
of
their
wild
ales
if
i
can
find
them
overall
this
is
a
very
wellmade
beer
that
id
like
to
have
more
of
if
the
price
was
right
most
of
the
elements
in
this
beer
tend
to
balance
themselves
out
so
that
nothing
is
particularly
overwhelming
except
that
the
sourness
is
always
there
it
does
deserve
to
be
priced
higher
than
many
other
beers
considering
the
effort
put
into
it
any
sour
lover
could
hardly
do
better
than
this
one
its
worth
the
effort
to
obtain
one
and
i
look
forward
to
its
next
arrival
in
philly
overall
tasty
tasty
i
love
russian
river
wilds
serving
type
bottle
overall
really
nice
for
my
first
sour
this
beer
continues
to
impress
me
and
it
is
my
favorite
some
time
in
the
bottle
really
does
magic
to
this
another
pop
from
the
cork
suppy
is
a
brownish
red
with
some
orange
up
towards
the
light
a
cream
colored
shell
of
foam
stays
on
top
throughout
with
nice
sheets
that
stick
smell
is
straight
out
lacto
with
sour
cherry
at
this
point
pungent
with
leather
and
i
guess
you
can
say
malt
from
the
base
a
bretty
sting
with
some
warming
the
cherry
has
not
left
it
only
got
more
aggressive
taste
is
just
oh
my
god
i
love
this
beer
cherry
flavor
with
sourness
that
knocks
socks
off
i
gotta
say
sup
does
wonders
in
the
bottle
if
you
have
a
good
batch
of
it
and
give
it
some
time
in
a
ok
enviornment
sometimes
warm
is
your
friend
lacto
soaked
cherry
with
pediosachbrett
in
that
order
no
fooling
supp
vs
sanct
you
can
tell
the
difference
especially
in
the
newer
sanct
versions
with
all
brett
lacto
shines
here
im
babbling
all
i
can
say
is
lay
these
suckers
down
if
you
got
em
they
will
sour
till
your
hearts
delight
much
more
than
the
batch
4
temptation
which
i
think
is
dwindling
i
love
it
hazy
soft
rose
color
with
a
whitish
head
this
beer
gave
much
sour
cherry
and
an
oaky
woodiness
in
the
nose
with
lesser
amounts
of
green
apple
and
horse
blanket
quite
intriguing
and
inviting
less
cherry
in
the
flavor
but
this
gave
way
to
other
fruits
maybe
a
touch
of
apricot
more
apple
and
a
light
berry
tartness
bubbly
carbonation
lifted
the
light
body
a
fine
beer
indeed
paired
nicely
with
blue
types
of
cheese
hazy
deep
orange
color
wonderfully
tart
aroma
of
sour
cherry
and
funk
sour
cherry
flavors
and
slight
oakiness
come
out
as
it
warms
sour
finish
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
absolutely
love
it
could
drink
this
ale
every
day
if
i
was
independently
wealthy
o
theres
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
but
really
its
just
so
well
made
the
wood
does
this
brew
a
real
honor
by
taking
would
could
be
seen
as
too
brettytartsweet
and
making
it
a
refined
offering
all
the
flavors
are
in
check
but
they
arent
exactly
conservative
either
id
love
to
hear
what
a
masters
palate
would
say
of
this
one
because
i
think
theres
far
more
in
there
than
a
laymen
can
give
credit
for
id
come
back
to
this
one
after
more
education
the
taste
was
very
tart
not
overly
sour
initially
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
sweetness
cherries
were
the
predominant
flavor
with
a
subtle
oakiness
the
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
really
tasty
and
satisfying
beer

i
could
go
on
and
on
about
this
beer
it
really
was
a
great
experience
to
drink
it
and
i
really
wish
i
could
get
this
on
a
weekly
basis
i
can
say
that
i
am
a
fan
of
sours
now
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
but
at
the
same
time
the
bar
is
set
very
high
supplication
pours
a
rose
color
with
a
bit
of
head
retention
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
sour
with
a
nice
fruity
cherry
note
as
it
warms
a
very
distinct
wine
and
funky
side
emerges
the
taste
has
the
cherries
and
a
mild
mild
oak
wine
presence
which
is
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
cherries
and
tartness
with
the
same
character
emerging
as
the
beer
warms
this
beer
is
extremely
light
and
refreshing
and
complex
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
for
the
summer
very
light
and
very
well
carbonated
with
a
nice
bite
have
not
quite
gotten
into
sours
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
get
going
with
overall
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
its
one
of
those
endlessly
complex
and
delicious
beers
where
even
when
you
write
too
much
in
your
review
you
still
havent
properly
described
all
the
beautiful
things
going
on
in
the
flavor
when
you
get
the
chance
to
drink
this
beer
take
it
this
is
described
by
rr
as
brown
ale
aged
in
french
oak
pinot
noir
barrels
with
three
strains
of
brettanomyces
lactobacillus
pediococcus
and
sour
cherries
it
was
also
my
first
real
sour
i
e
not
the
duchesse
or
monks
flemish
i
decided
this
was
the
place
and
beer
to
try
it
with
i
wasnt
disappointed
it
was
really
really
good
its
hard
for
me
to
evaluate
it
because
of
my
lack
of
sour
expertise
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
look
forward
to
trying
other
rr
sour
offerings
that
i
brought
back
with
me
from
seattle
o
i
typically
dont
like
sour
beers
or
lambics
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
exceptional
o
always
a
favorite
of
mine
when
it
comes
to
sours
very
complex
and
refreshing
im
so
lucky
to
have
this
beer
available
at
all
times
overall
very
very
good
and
so
refreshing
a
testimony
to
what
subtle
can
be
it
is
sour
but
a
lot
of
other
things
too
i
love
it
4
55
o
i
have
read
and
read
and
read
about
russian
river
this
russian
river
that
well
there
is
a
reason
people
are
talking
this
might
be
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
pours
a
slight
hazy
reddish
brown
into
the
glass
with
bright
red
highlights
aromas
of
tart
cherry
and
dark
fruit
and
oak
flavor
is
a
burst
of
intense
but
smooth
sourness
delivered
nicely
with
the
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
faint
oak
very
soft
malt
flavors
stay
on
the
tongue
as
it
dries
out
on
the
finish
not
my
style
of
beer
but
starting
to
intrigue
me
more
and
more
just
like
2ipas
did
a
couple
of
yrs
ago
now
they
are
1
of
my
favorite
styles
maybe
sours
will
be
next
not
my
style
but
highly
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
would
seek
this
out
again
and
continue
aging
a
few
to
see
the
effects
californians
you
are
lucky
very
very
lucky
o
such
a
cool
beer
but
to
be
honest
im
not
sure
my
palette
is
mature
enough
to
fully
appreciate
itbut
i
know
what
i
like
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
these
varieties
this
beer
is
definately
worth
the
18
bucks
i
paid
for
a
small
375
ml
bottle
another
half
a
bottle
courtesy
of
goblinmunkey7
score
unchanged
this
is
legendary
i
want
to
write
love
letters
to
this
beer
while
i
dont
like
having
to
struggle
with
the
cork
it
is
a
minor
inconvenience
when
it
comes
to
drinking
this
nectar
pour
resulted
in
a
two
finger
head
of
foam
with
just
a
little
sediment
i
guess
i
should
have
poured
it
a
bit
slower
nice
lace
that
clings
well
from
beginning
to
end
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
9
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
i
think
i
am
the
fault
of
most
of
the
haze
smell
is
a
rich
complex
palate
of
wonderful
aromas
sweet
tree
fruit
smells
pear
apple
and
cherry
tart
smells
of
mint
leaf
and
anise
taste
is
a
grand
mixture
of
pleasing
flavors
of
cherry
caramel
grapefruit
sour
red
grapes
anise
malt
and
a
hint
of
wood
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
much
like
butter
melting
in
your
mouth
with
zing
added
for
effect
i
would
like
another
but
my
wallet
would
scream
and
so
would
my
head
from
the
rush
of
alcohol
d
an
excellent
beer
that
really
show
off
the
potential
for
non
traditional
sour
beer
matured
in
barrels
nothing
is
wasted
or
excessive
here
the
cherry
contributes
a
great
deal
of
complexity
while
the
wine
barrel
aging
is
a
background
note
that
briefly
pops
out
as
a
distinctive
vinous
character
in
the
finish
the
sourness
and
bone
dry
finish
both
work
to
enhance
the
drinkability
of
an
already
very
quaffable
beer
finish
wow
dry
and
complex
an
immaculate
beer
that
offers
plenty
of
texture
and
surprises
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
world
o
this
is
my
second
of
the
russian
river
sours
and
this
one
was
more
enjoyable
than
consecration
to
me
overall
love
the
use
of
the
cherries
and
the
nice
oak
presence
as
well
a
fantastic
example
of
a
wild
and
a
great
introduction
to
wilds
as
well
very
well
done
i
brought
back
three
of
these
from
colorado
and
now
i
am
really
regretting
not
bringing
back
more
o
i
love
this
beer
and
i
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
some
older
batches
of
this
my
favorite
sour
aroma
is
filled
with
cherries
and
apples
taste
is
the
perfect
balance
of
tartness
and
sweetness
dont
get
me
wrong
its
definitely
a
sour
but
its
not
over
the
top
sour
its
basically
the
most
balanced
sour
ive
ever
tasted
this
is
only
one
of
a
few
sours
that
i
would
completely
feel
comfortable
and
excited
about
drinking
pint
after
pint
seriously
i
would
drink
multiple
pints
of
this
in
a
row
i
love
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
rich
brownish
amber
in
color
very
reminiscent
of
cherry
wood
it
featured
a
nice
cream
colored
head
which
laces
the
glass
and
sticks
to
the
sides
the
aromas
consist
of
primarily
sour
cherry
with
a
light
grape
like
sweetness
it
has
a
good
amount
of
funk
but
its
hard
to
tell
which
is
winning
the
cherry
or
the
funk
im
glad
the
sweetness
is
allowed
to
show
past
the
cherry
the
flavors
are
very
sour
and
dry
you
definitely
get
a
boatload
of
cherry
oak
and
nice
funk
the
tartness
is
in
your
face
initially
before
letting
the
other
flavors
take
place
the
most
impressive
aspect
is
how
the
flavor
resonates
even
five
minutes
later
it
leaves
behind
a
really
really
nice
aftertaste
of
all
of
the
flavors
meshed
together
in
perfect
harmony
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
wild
and
i
definitely
prefer
it
over
consecration
oi
bought
another
one
to
cellar
and
i
am
damn
excited
this
beer
should
do
quite
well
with
some
time
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
wild
ale
great
beer
stoked
to
have
access
to
it
all
three
of
these
batches
are
fabulous
the
4
was
definitely
my
favorite
as
it
exhibited
all
of
the
characteristics
you
look
for
in
a
sour
in
spades
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
just
noticed
i
made
it
all
the
way
though
this
review
without
saying
sour
its
sour
folks
pours
a
beautiful
red
orange
with
no
head
but
some
lacing
is
left
aroma
is
of
cider
vinegar
and
cherries
taste
follows
the
nose
tart
in
the
best
way
possible
leaves
cherries
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
dry
but
not
too
dry
this
is
an
excellent
wild
ale
a
great
beer
at
this
age
but
im
not
sure
if
aging
it
longer
will
do
it
any
good
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
the
sourness
isnt
that
prevalent
but
it
meshes
very
well
with
all
of
the
flavors
the
fruit
flavors
make
this
very
refreshing
and
leave
you
wanting
more
overall
blown
away
by
this
one
the
wine
barrel
aging
sourness
and
vinegar
and
light
sour
cherries
really
work
well
together
overall
an
exceptional
beer
and
truly
worthy
of
its
praise
easily
my
favorite
russian
river
offering
to
date
beautiful
noir
qualities
to
this
brew
you
definitely
get
some
of
the
sweet
wine
barrel
literally
consumed
by
tart
bing
like
cherries
tart
acidic
a
touch
of
funk
with
some
dark
grapes
and
an
excellent
vinous
character
the
taste
is
sharp
and
sweet
a
bit
of
pucker
and
some
sweet
fruits
oak
and
those
sweet
sweet
cherries
carbonation
was
great
for
this
beer
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
bite
in
the
flavor
dont
know
why
im
hatin
it
was
delicious
just
could
have
used
a
little
more
bite
or
intensity
to
set
it
over
the
top
overall
this
was
one
of
the
best
brews
of
the
day
thanks
again
chuck
i
have
another
one
that
i
got
as
an
extra
from
a
great
trader
doverhills
thanks
mark
so
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
batch
with
a
little
age
cheers
this
is
a
great
beer
the
combination
of
sweet
fruit
and
funky
sour
is
fantastic
its
like
a
cross
between
a
fruit
beer
and
a
wild
and
i
think
the
taste
is
the
weakest
aspect
of
it
wish
i
could
drink
it
more
often
od
overall
i
love
it
my
favorite
sour
so
far
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
to
take
downsmooth
and
light
drink
very
carbonated
tartness
hits
you
hard
but
calms
down
lingers
in
the
mouth
overall
great
beer
always
love
it
excellent
overall
i
liked
it
better
than
temptation
and
consecration
and
maybe
even
better
than
sanctification
which
to
this
point
had
been
my
favorite
sourish
beer
glad
i
have
another
couple
of
bottles
definitely
something
i
want
to
drink
more
often
than
the
yearly
bottle
i
currently
get
overall
a
wonderful
american
wild
id
love
to
see
more
breweries
explore
the
style
the
way
russian
river
has
overall
supplication
is
a
very
interesting
complex
and
delicious
beer
definitely
glad
i
was
able
to
get
hands
on
a
bottle
o
the
overall
value
of
this
sour
wild
ale
is
incredible
for
the
amount
that
is
made
of
this
sour
its
pretty
impressive
o
another
quality
product
something
id
go
back
to
in
that
10
range
again
again
cheers
overall
im
not
blown
away
y
this
beer
but
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
at
the
same
time
im
a
bit
surprised
that
this
came
in
so
high
alltime
on
the
rankings
id
grab
for
a
blind
pig
from
russian
river
much
quicker
than
i
would
for
this
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
wild
ales
on
the
market
and
its
nice
that
rr
brews
this
and
releases
it
a
few
times
a
year
always
nice
to
have
a
fresh
back
to
drink
and
then
a
few
to
age
o
a
nice
treat
to
pop
open
on
my
birthday
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
great
flavor
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
certain
occasions
but
not
something
i
want
to
drink
everyday
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
sour
but
not
overly
so
not
much
sweetness
on
this
one
pretty
darn
good
d
i
love
rr
sours
but
i
think
this
has
to
be
my
least
favorite
trying
to
age
some
to
see
if
it
gets
any
better
but
right
now
id
put
it
in
4th
behind
compunction
temptation
consecration
and
sanctification
o
probably
one
of
the
best
wildbrett
ales
ive
had
very
delicious
i
cant
really
complain
about
anything
on
this
one
o
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
brew
and
worthy
of
being
called
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
one
of
my
first
sours
and
was
a
little
worried
if
i
would
like
it
or
not
and
its
great
overall
if
you
are
in
search
of
a
sour
beer
this
is
one
of
the
tops
this
will
light
your
taste
buds
up
like
licking
a
9
volt
batteryand
thats
about
it
not
much
for
flavor
price
point
is
off
by
a
mile
and
this
is
something
that
you
would
rather
have
a
sample
of
not
too
many
people
would
sit
down
and
enjoy
this
beer
imo
this
is
one
you
split
between
5
or
6
people
just
to
say
youve
had
it
overall
simply
amazing
i
had
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
a
very
long
time
and
upon
finally
getting
the
chance
i
was
worried
i
would
have
built
it
up
too
much
in
my
expectations
certainly
not
the
case
though
this
is
a
stellar
beer
i
love
the
complexity
that
this
beer
holds
and
i
love
knowing
how
much
time
and
effort
went
into
making
it
i
will
without
a
doubt
be
getting
this
again
in
the
near
future
o
this
beer
is
truly
a
treat
and
one
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
in
earnest
ohad
this
on
tap
a
few
times
at
monks
and
i
always
seem
to
pick
one
up
when
i
go
to
the
bottle
shop
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
tions
the
only
bad
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
due
to
the
sourness
and
acidity
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
drink
more
than
one
overall
a
great
beer
pours
an
amber
color
good
clarity
with
active
carbonation
a
clingy
white
foam
is
very
active
at
first
but
dies
down
to
sticky
lacing
fairly
quick
the
aromas
are
very
cool
lots
of
funk
and
sour
fruit
the
taste
is
decadent
very
mellow
with
active
bubbles
that
fizz
on
first
contact
with
the
tongue
quickly
the
onset
of
sour
cherry
and
orange
peel
take
over
with
a
very
complex
finish
that
leaves
a
lasting
and
changing
funk
in
your
mouth
nice
acidity
not
overpowering
very
well
crafted
sour
o
a
solid
beer
i
always
enjoy
todays
no
exception
as
good
as
they
make
them
in
america
for
6
a
glass
id
drink
this
more
often
at
12
a
bottle
im
not
buying
one
of
these
too
frequently
definitely
worth
a
try
though
seek
it
out
drink
it
enjoy

only
this
sour

could
create
an
agent
of
such

such
swiftly

candor
bitterly
imparting
a
smooth
sourness

curators
mouth
o
this
one
has
earned
its
place
as
one
of
the
best
sours
on
the
market
amazing
stuff
overall
i
am
loving
sours
and
this
sure
helps
my
experience
with
them
i
liked
consecration
more
than
this
but
this
is
still
a
solid
brew
i
would
gladly
take
more
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
the
other
one
in
my
cellar
matures
ive
had
all
3
of
the
regular
rr
sours
several
times
this
is
my
favorite
i
always
wonder
how
hyped
this
beer
would
be
if
it
were
brewed
once
with
cherries
from
some
tree
that
died
overall
fantastic
i
have
been
slowly
getting
more
and
more
into
this
style
and
after
having
this
one
i
am
hooked
absolutely
a
world
class
beer
this
is
a
great
beverage
russian
rivers
experimentation
and
attention
to
detail
pays
off
to
wrap
this
upin
comclusion
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
it
has
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
a
mouthwatering
sweetsour
flavor
profile
acompanied
by
all
of
complexities
that
youd
look
for
in
a
beer
as
deserving
as
this
d
after
having
batch
005
on
tap
yesterday
id
say
the
fresher
this
beer
the
better
when
the
beer
is
fresh
the
fruit
flavors
or
more
vibrant
but
the
sourness
and
funkiness
levels
are
a
little
less
abrasive
this
beer
is
delicious
at
any
age
but
out
of
the
three
batches
ive
had
id
rank
them
in
the
following
order
best
to
worst
003
005
004
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
sours
so
many
great
clean
and
distinct
layers
of
flavor
make
me
keep
wanting
to
take
another
sip
exceptional
ale
that
i
simply
can
not
get
enough
of
t
huge
sourness
with
some
sweet
malts
in
the
background
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
the
sourness
is
a
combination
of
apple
cider
vinegar
and
sour
cherries
for
me
and
is
incredible
this
is
such
an
amazing
beer
o
would
drink
again
on
a
special
occasion
forgot
to
write
down
the
batch
number
on
this
bottle
but
i
am
pretty
sure
it
is
the
same
as
the
one
i
have
in
cellar
overall
very
good
well
balanced
beer
i
could
feel
the
sourness
in
my
jaw
with
each
sip
i
took
another
great
sour
from
russian
river
wish
i
could
say
more
but
i
only
got
this
out
of
respect
for
how
well
regarded
rr
sour
beers
are
and
to
be
honest
this
is
fantastic
met
be
some
type
of
sour
that
i
dont
agree
with
but
its
non
existent
here
supremely
enjoyable
o
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
must
have
beer
if
you
are
just
getting
into
the
style
this
may
be
a
bit
intense
but
should
give
you
some
good
hindsight
about
the
style
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
brew
and
worthy
of
being
called
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
winegrape
like

with

some

tart
but
not
over
the
top
good

to
balance
quite
a
round

body
for
the
style
makes
it
drink
like
a
charm
tasty
and
worth
the
acclaim
glad
to
have
it
d
fantastic
sour
meant
to
be
sipped
just
like
a
fine
dry
red
overall
very
complex
beer
i
enjoy
sours
a
great
deal
and
this
is
the
best
ive
had
for
the
style
sometimes
its
nice
to
have
a
sour
that
has
more
sweetness
but
this
has
a
very
winelike
character
and
lots
of
different
flavors
fantastic
wild
ale
here
would
have
this
again
anytime
with
food
or
without
balanced
not
overpowering
great
body
tasty
brew
overall
this
beer
is
strange
yet
amazing
at
the
same
time
its
quite
a
unique
beer
that
you
will
either
love
or
hate
and
i
love
it
its
so
far
from
what
most
people
consider
the
norm
yet
it
is
absolutely
delicious
one
of
my
new
favorites
wonderful
wonderful
beer
perhaps
a
bit
too
sour
for
the
uninitiated
and
perhaps
a
bit
too
fruity
for
the
sourlovers
but
a
great
balance
and
an
impressive
beer
now
only
if
i
could
get
it
more
readily

semifunky

and
sweet
apple
oak
and
yeast
flavors
become
apparent
on
the

drying
and
semipuckering
very
nice
beer
im
a
learner
in
the
sour
department
but
this
beer
converted
me
to
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
and
rushed
out
the
next
day
to
procure
another
bottle
this
will
be
a
beer
ill
seek
out
as
a
regular
whenever
its
available
mouthfeeloverall
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonated
and
bubbly
very
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
great
wild
ale
really
nice
balance
between
fruit
and
sour
ive
got
both
temptation
and
consecration
and
am
interested
to
see
what
i
like
the
best
this
is
by
far
the
most
delicious
wild
ale
ive
ever
had
keyword
here
is
refreshing
balancing
out
the
sour
notes
are
sweet
stonefruit
and
assertive
oak
describing
the
sour
flavor
is
more
difficult
im
not
getting
much
of
an
acetic
vibe
here
the
pungence
is
more
easily
ascribed
to
whitish
grapefruit
rind
without
the
bitters
vivid
carbonation
really
props
up
the
intensity
of
this
beer
certainly
worth
the
price
and
thats
saying
something
for
me
superb
overall
awesome
beer
great
tart
sourr
flavors
nice
brett
and
wild
flavors
nice
cherry
flavor
and
touch
of
oak
drinkability
i
wish
i
had
another
a
very
unique
beer
that
doesnt
feel
like
a
beer
at
all
the
fruity
sweetness
with
tart
sourness
blends
well
in
a
light
consistent
beer
d
this
beer
is
very
solid
very
crisp
and
smooth
its
sour
but
not
overwhelmingly
sour
but
its
present
so
expect
some
bite
to
it
although
i
dont
have
many
sour
ales
under
my
belt
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
o
this
is
a
great
sour
and
i
am
very
happy
to
have
another
bottle
to
save
for
a
later
date
i
am
just
blown
away
by
this
beer
m
extremely
bubbly
and
carbonated
though
light
on
the
palate
overall
a
wonderful
mouth
feel
for
the
style
wow
always
awesome
not
for
the
closedmind
or
faint
at
heart
this
review
is
for
batch
005x4
gentle
pour
reveals
a
reddish
brownish
orangish
beer
with
an
offpinkwhite
head
that
hangs
in
there
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
as
it
goes

black

raspberry
lactic

and
funk
brilliant
hands
down
miles
ahead
of
the
competition
in
the
us
in
the
taste
everything
is
in
near
perfect
harmony
with
dark
cherry
and
nut
flavors
rearing
their
heads
throughout
leathery
wine
barrel
notes
midpalate
and
a
nice
funky
sourness
that
wraps
everything
up
leaving
the
palate
very
cleanly
while
just
a
hint
of
spice
and
heatwarmth
linger
medium
full
body
that
never
gets
sticky
finish
is
just
hot
enough
to
amplify
the
experience
and
really
add
some
depth
to
the
character
just
wonderful
classy
and
sophisticated
this
is
the
brewing
art
at
its
finest
for
sure
i
think
this
is
the
best
experience
ive
had
to
date
with
this
beer
so
id
definitely
recommend
aging
a
bottle
for
a
year
and
a
half
this
is
the
most
balanced
sour
beer
i
can
remember
having
with
all
sorts
of
flavors
and
smells
to
pick
up
that
can
too
often
be
covered
up
by
a
cloying
sourness
i
always
told
my
parents
i
wanted
to
be
a
blue
angels
pilot
when
i
grew
up
but
now
i
just
want
to
be
vinnie
cilurzo
overall
i
quite
like
this
beer
really
wished
i
lived
closer
to
where
this
was
sold
on
the
shelves
d
a
great
brew
to
say
the
least
this
is
balanced
in
its
tartness
impressive
in
both
its
breadth
and
depth
of
flavor
and
yet
remains
distinct
from
the
sour
ales
of
belgium
i
couldnt
justifiably
classify
this
lambic
nor
flanders
ale
it
is
its
own
style
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
access
to
rrs
brews
as
it
is
a
great
example
of
americas
ability
to
take
the
best
parts
of
other
brewing
traditions
while
adding
our
own
flair
overall
excellent
taste
with
a
fair
measure
of
sourness
one
of
my
first
introductory
sours
that
im
finally
reviewing
russian
river
always
comes
through
on
the
sours
poured
into
a
russian
river
tion
glass
because
i
will
not
have
it
any
other
way
pours
a
rather
hazy
golden
apricot
color
with
a
bright
white
head
smell
like
a
goddamn
delicious
river
in
the
hills
of
russia
some
funk
and
hints
of
peach
behind
some
fragrant
cherry
notes
taste
is
fortunately
the
same
and
this
is
a
rather
refreshing
beverage
spoton
carbonation
with
lighter
medium
body
thanks
matt
if
youre
reading
this
because
you
dont
know
if
you
should
get
supplication
do
like
i
did
get
one
every
year
by
the
fifth
year
youll
like
it
this
is
some
good
asss
shit
overall
why
did
i
only
bring
six
back
with
me
this
is
an
outstanding
wild
ale
crisp
and
clean
tart
on
your
tongue
just
try
to
name
all
of
the
smells
and
flavors
you
experience
with
this
offering
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
low
abv
and
a
great
mouth
feel
are
pluses
but
even
though
it
tastes
great
i
dont
think
i
could
take
more
then
2
of
these
at
a
time
because
of
the
mouth
puckering
sour
sensation
mouthfeel
is
acidic
but
not
overly
so
the
feel
is
balanced
by
some
sugary
character
and
the
fruits
somehow
drinkabiility
is
very
very
good
for
such
a
strong
sour
beer
the
balance
mentioned
earlier
is
a
boon
to
this
category
your
mouth
doesnt
get
killed
by
the
acidity
in
this
as
much
as
in
some
other
strong
sours
and
it
lets
the
beer
be
drinkable
for
a
long
period
of
time
if
you
havent
had
a
wild
ale
have
this
and
youll
be
sold
on
the
style
o
simply
an
outstanding
beer
one
that
disappeared
from
my
glass
quickly
and
certainly
one
that
i
will
be
picking
up
again
cheers
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
i
think
its
my
favorite
out
of
the
three
readily
available
russian
river
sours
although
it
is
very
close
i
pick
this
up
whenever
i
see
it
o
this
beer
packs
a
punch
sour
noobs
be
aware
this
is
extremely
sour
very
drinkable
and
perfectly
balanced
between
the
fruits
the
acidity
the
funkyness
this
is
an
exceptional
offering
from
russian
river
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
o
well
what
more
can
i
say
this
was
an
amazing
beer
easily
one
of
the
most
flavorful
complex
and
nuanced
ive
ever
had
another
home
run
from
russian
river
overall
this
beer
is
a
testament
to
the
idea
that
brewing
is
as
valid
an
art
as
any
as
a
beer
with
unbridled
complexity
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
after
each
sip
supplication
is
a
memorable
experience
that
is
well
worth
the
high
price
overall
it
is
worth
all
the
hype
and
all
the
time
it
took
me
to
get
ahold
of
this
one
i
dont
understand
why
theres
minimum
250
word
for
a
review
some
beers
dont
need
a
lot
of
word
mfd
dances
on
the
palate
every
so
lightly
carbonation
helps
the
flavors
coat
your
entire
mouth
very
drinkable
and
at
only
7
can
enjoy
it
over
and
over
the
4
is
better
than
5
the
age
defineitly
does
this
body
good
d
very
drinkable
delicious
id
definitely
seek
this
out
again
one
of
my
favorite
sours
dthis
is
very
simple
and
straight
forward
but
still
very
tasty
the
flavors
blend
together
very
well
and
it
goes
down
so
smooth
it
has
a
great
sourness
to
it
with
virtually
no
acidity
its
medium
in
body
with
a
mild
carbonation
but
its
a
highly
drinkable
sour
and
its
a
really
top
notch
example
of
the
style
not
really
puckeringly
sour
but
sour
enough
and
the
cherries
add
an
extra
level
of
complexity
im
definitely
glad
ive
got
a
few
more
of
these
tucked
away
in
the
cellar
batch
005x5
starts
off
with
an
explosion
of
bubbles
that
help
spread
the
funky
goodness
not
very
over
powering
in
the
sour
as
the
hints
of
oak
begin
to
take
the
place
of
the
cherry
flavor
lingering
oak
and
tart
finish
well
balance
for
a
sour
very
interesting
not
sure
im
convince
of
being
a
sour
fan
yet
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
one
again
pours
a
brownish
red
with
a
thick
beige
head
that
dissipates
leaving
a
filmy
layer
at
the
top
smell
is
of
spoiled
cherries
hints
of
oak
and
earth
taste
is
quite
vinegary
almost
too
much
so
sour
cherries
and
heavy
lacto
there
is
a
light
funk
and
light
lingering
biter
on
the
throat
pinot
very
much
shines
through
on
the
second
sip
finishes
very
dry
leaving
my
mouth
a
bit
parched
heavy
alcohol
burn
on
the
swallow
which
is
surprising
for
a
beer
of
only
7
d
very
drinkable
throughly
enjoyed
this
one
a
slightly
cloudy
brown
amber
color
with
a
modest
fuzzy
white
cover
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
undoubtedly
floral
cherry
with
a
subtle
lemony
air
if
you
enjoy
sours
this
is
pretty
nice
the
flavor
initially
says
sour
sour
sour
yikes
it
has
a
definitive
alkaseltzer
quality
with
cherries
on
steroids
its
a
bit
lemony
with
granny
apple
cherry
tart
bite
quite
a
lip
twister
with
a
hyperactive
carbonation
that
keeps
a
lively
feel
in
a
midlight
bodied
fizzy
brew
its
pretty
drinkable
if
you
go
for
this
sour
stuffn
and
i
do
nice
poured
from
bottle
batch
005x3
into
snifter
glass
pours
murky
brown
hazy
amber
with
a
minor
then
dissipating
head
leaving
very
thin
lacing
throughout
the
session
nose
is
big
and
soft
lots
of
vinous
type
notes
cherries
are
still
vibrant
in
this
one
funky
oaty
lactic
acid
oak
vinegar
tart
cherries
wild
yeast
and
sour
nose
on
taste
this
is
how
to
do
a
cherry
sour
softened
acidity
the
oak
comes
across
to
prop
up
the
cherry
notes
medium
body
with
some
graininess
and
some
sharp
but
soft
carbonation
the
finish
is
very
tart
and
dry
this
is
a
great
sour
beer
for
sour
beer
lovers
top
50
material
for
me
not
for
me
but
wow
what
a
beer
respect
d
this
is
a
really
outstanding
wild
ale
im
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
one
pours
a
clear
red
color
with
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
bubbling
from
the
bottom
at
first
but
eventually
it
stops
smells
of
typical
wild
critters
along
with
some
indistinguishable
fruit
notes
taste
is
very
sour
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
the
flavor
sits
on
the
tongue
for
a
bit
and
livens
up
the
mouth
has
some
winelike
qualities
to
it
but
not
really
like
a
pinot
the
mouthfeel
is
intense
as
it
constantly
has
that
tingling
going
on
drinkability
is
good
for
a
sour
i
wouldnt
drink
these
all
day
long
but
very
nice
my
favorite
rr
sour
of
those
ive
tried
temptation
consecration
drinkability
well
it
cost
a
pretty
penny
to
get
out
here
i
think
the
depthcostsourness
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
definitely
intend
on
savoring
this
one
really
impressed
with
my
first
taste
of
russian
river
i
got
this
from
mikesgroove
a
while
ago
in
a
trade
thanks
again
mike
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
slightly
red
hue
to
it
starts
with
about
a
finger
of
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
at
first
i
kind
of
just
thought
this
smelled
medicinal
i
was
put
of
at
first
and
thought
i
was
getting
set
up
for
a
big
disapointment
once
i
got
into
it
a
little
bit
sweet
cherries
reveal
themselves
as
an
overtone
to
the
aroma
with
a
nice
balance
of
oak
and
bret
funk
it
finishes
with
a
slightly
tart
vinegar
aroma
to
it
world
class
flavor
on
this
cherries
right
up
front
being
slightly
tart
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
finish
it
out
woody
oak
notes
surround
the
pallet
here
the
feel
is
kind
of
dry
with
lively
carbonation
really
nothing
to
shake
a
stick
at
here
overall
russian
river
seems
to
make
some
of
the
most
drinkable
american
sours
on
the
market
file
this
under
permawant
mildly
acidic
with
a
prickly
carbonation
is
absolutely
perfect
this
beer
is
insanely
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
to
the
palate
it
drinks
very
similar
to
a
good
pinot
noir
as
the
wine
characteristics
truly
shine
in
this
beer
another
knockout
punch
from
russian
river
the
best
american
wild
ale
ive
sampled
to
date
funky
complex
sour
but
altogether
wellbalanced
and
superbly
drinkable
wow
this
beer
was
without
a
doubt
like
nothing
i
had
ever
had
before
hard
to
tell
at
times
if
that
was
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
i
am
leaning
toward
good
but
really
struggled
to
finish
with
the
overpowering
flavors
eventually
getting
to
me
quite
a
bit
too
much
sour
for
me
to
enjoy
finishing
the
entire
bottle
let
alone
having
another
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
sour
brew
not
really
my
style
its
a
good
beer
but
not
my
style
sours
have
never
really
made
it
up
my
alley
good
to
try
if
you
like
tart
brews
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
sours
was
extremely
successful
a
very
unique
beer
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
i
highly
recommend
this
expertlycrafted
brew
drink
outstanding
by
itself
but
with
the
right
dessert
for
me
could
be
magical
the
cherries
and
the
bubbles
are
like
a
nice
white
wine
vinnies
background
is
very
evident
in
the
sours
he
does
d
this
was
a
great
wild
ale
with
super
sour
and
tart
scent
and
taste
it
had
a
light
and
fizzy
body
which
i
normally
dont
like
but
it
worked
well
for
the
style
alcohol
wasnt
noticeable
either
so
this
was
really
not
that
difficult
to
drink
but
like
most
wild
ales
this
beer
is
really
meant
to
be
sipped
not
sure
how
age
might
help
this
one
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
fresh
d
definitely
one
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
makes
me
want
to
travel
to
california
more
often
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
it
builds
on
the
belgian
bruin
style
with
a
foundation
of
bacteriaproduced
sourness
and
cherries
but
aging
in
pinot
noir
barrels
gives
this
its
lovely
spicy
varietal
element
that
is
unique
and
delicious
ok
i
like
pinot
closest
to
a
perfect
beer
as
ive
ever
had
as
enjoyable
as
temptation
for
me
smell
is
not
spectacular
but
the
taste
is
very
good
for
this
style
oak
smell
and
the
sour
taste
make
this
beer
quit
good
cherries
far
away
this
is
not
my
style
as
you
may
have
noticed
but
not
bad
overall
wonderful
experience
from
rr
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
drinkability
i
love
the
sour
fruity
and
funky
notes
but
the
red
wine
and
tannins
are
a
little
out
of
control
it
limits
the
overall
enjoyment
beer
should
taste
like
beer
this
one
tastes
too
much
like
wine
pours
a
reddish
with
thin
white
head
smells
like
oak
cherries
with
some
sourness
tastes
like
sour
cherries
slightly
tart
sour
finish
you
can
taste
the
wood
in
there
as
well
very
good
beer
drinkability
is
high
mouthfeel
is
good
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
they
distributed
to
indiana
that
and
if
they
were
cheaper
the
cpj
d
thankfully
i
dont
come
across
this
often
so
i
can
honestly
write
that
i
will
drink
it
every
opportunity
i
get
really
excellent
the
funky
brett
flavor
just
shines
in
this
brew
smooth
and
tart
complex
and
well
balanced
all
around
d
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
the
acidity
would
be
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
drinking
it
all
night
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
main
issue
is
the
price
i
know
that
price
is
not
part
of
drinkability
so
i
did
not
mark
down
my
rating
in
this
category
but
it
is
an
extremely
expensive
beer
and
due
to
that
fact
i
feel
it
is
a
great
beer
to
try
here
and
there
but
not
something
i
would
really
go
after
again
pours
a
lovely
ruby
red
color
with
a
very
light
filmy
head
mild
sweet
sour
aroma
nice
hints
or
orange
very
flavorful
taste
of
orange
cherry
and
lime
the
finish
is
very
sweet
sour
with
a
similar
yet
mild
aftertaste
surprisingly
theres
very
little
bitterness
here
light
to
mediumbodied
with
mild
carbonation
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
this
is
batch
04x1
this
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
foam
that
degrades
to
a
thin
layer
but
stays
that
thin
layer
throughout
the
consuming
of
this
beer
this
beer
has
the
funk
that
is
so
sought
after
in
many
of
the
sours
that
i
know
there
is
a
citrus
sour
that
comes
from
all
sorts
of
bacteria
there
is
some
cherry
notes
on
the
nose
as
well
with
some
pretty
decent
oak
notes
the
taste
is
sour
oh
so
sour
the
tartness
of
the
intentional
infection
is
not
something
that
i
know
if
im
ever
gonna
get
used
to
ive
really
probably
got
to
work
my
way
up
to
appreciating
these
beers
the
tart
mouthfeel
goes
down
pretty
easy
its
got
good
carbonation
for
the
style
and
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
if
i
do
say
so
again
its
not
my
style
but
then
again
i
never
respected
hop
bombs
so
maybe
the
time
will
come
for
me
to
revisit
this
beer
another
great
sour
ale
from
rr
its
got
a
lot
of
great
flavor
and
a
refreshing
quality
to
it
definitely
want
more
d
i
like
this
beer
and
would
drink
this
alot
but
the
reason
it
isnt
perfect
just
results
in
the
style
the
sour
for
me
is
overwhelming
and
makes
this
very
difficult
to
put
away
ive
been
working
in
some
sour
beers
to
get
accustomed
but
this
is
still
a
bit
much
for
me
d
very
drinkable
wish
i
had
another
to
go
with
the
first
one
d
pretty
darn
good
i
prefer
temptation
but
would
never
refuse
another
bottle
try
it
you
wont
be
disapointed
drinkability
really
an
amazing
beer
and
on
part
with
the
other
great
beers
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
sample
from
russian
river
nice
smells
amazing
flavors
and
a
roller
coaster
of
a
mouthfeel
certainly
give
it
a
lot
of
credence
however
the
strong
nature
of
the
acidity
and
extreme
tartness
is
not
something
that
i
feel
i
would
crave
on
a
regular
basis
but
when
the
mood
strikes
this
is
a
world
class
offering
d
highly
drinkable
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sour
beers
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
i
really
think
that
i
would
be
drinking
it
all
the
time
a
very
chill
sweetness
to
it
along
with
a
gritty
earthiness
one
of
the
best
wild
ales
out
there
only
rivaled
in
its
style
by
bruerys
oude
tart
w
sour
cherries
drinkability
if
i
lived
somewhere
that
this
was
readily
available
i
would
line
my
cellar
with
it
a
great
brew
the
only
thing
that
hindered
its
drinkability
was
knowing
that
once
i
drank
it
all
i
had
no
more
gives
a
whole
new
meaning
to
crying
in
your
beer
d
delicious
beer
by
rr
i
really
enjoyed
this
sour
and
have
been
slowly
getting
into
them
with
this
one
being
the
best
yet
mouthfeel
was
spot
on
moderately
thick
creamy
carbonation
and
a
slight
drying
fantastic
sour
not
sure
if
i
liked
it
as
much
as
temptation
but
very
well
balanced
with
great
bold
flavors
loved
it
ive
gone
out
of
my
way
to
bring
this
back
to
texas
with
me
a
few
times
and
im
homebrewing
a
batch
to
duplicate
its
wild
nd
sour
character
can
there
be
any
higher
praise
this
is
unquestionably
a
world
class
beer
lengthy
sour
finish
delicious
this
beer
would
be
great
with
a
cheese
plate
and
some
dark
fruits
each
sip
is
seemingly
palate
cleansing
did
i
say
delicious
more
more
more
please
appearance
is
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
off
white
collar
of
foam
smell
is
pronounced
sour
cherry
not
much
else
taste
is
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
without
any
yeasty
funkiness
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
nice
and
moist
to
start
fading
slowly
to
a
crisp
dryness
this
beer
is
an
excellent
reminder
of
what
a
good
beer
can
be
and
an
excellent
return
for
me
to
reviewing
beers
d
mind
blowing
had
this
while
brewing
a
pliny
clone
with
my
father
wow
thanks
russian
river
great
brews
and
pushing
the
style
envelope
i
could
find
my
self
drinking
many
of
these
sours
d
i
drink
it
all
the
time
and
just
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
12
bucks
a
bottle
on
the
east
coast
is
also
holding
this
back
but
i
still
buy
it
the
color
is
a
medium
colored
amber
with
a
typical
fizzy
head
aroma
is
fantastic
citrus
malt
almost
fruity
flavor
is
also
very
good
quite
sour
with
a
citrus
flavor
some
sense
of
the
brown
ale
as
well
overall
one
of
the
best
sour
ales
out
there
d
so
nice
id
definitely
order
another
and
will
buy
again
when
i
can
definitely
something
i
plan
on
seeking
out
in
the
future
im
going
to
keep
my
eyes
peeled
for
this
on
tap
too
d
this
is
a
tums
required
beer
so
vinegary
so
acidic
that
youll
eventually
need
some
relief
after
a
375
as
much
as
i
love
the
flavor
this
gets
somewhat
offensive
when
you
near
the
dregs
after
nearly
a
whole
375ml
i
feel
like
ive
stripped
a
coat
of
skin
off
my
tongue
and
mouth
d
fairly
drinkable
very
good
for
a
sour
though
d
this
is
the
first
sour
that
ive
been
determined
to
purchase
again
amazing
d
high
for
a
sour
in
my
opinion
while
most
sours
are
good
for
4oz
and
then
youre
done
this
one
you
can
have
a
good
bit
more
and
not
get
tired
of
it
great
balance
tasty
this
was
on
the
bottle
list
at
bar
crudo
in
san
francisco
i
couldnt
pass
up
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
though
i
did
see
bottles
of
it
later
i
just
wasnt
sure
that
i
would
pours
a
golden
orange
colour
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
nice
head
retention
and
amazing
layer
of
lace
down
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
of
sour
cherries
and
apples
with
some
vinegar
and
oak
as
well
flavour
is
quite
sour
i
let
my
friends
try
this
beer
which
then
set
them
off
on
a
quest
to
keep
drinking
sour
beers
whenever
possible
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
do
yourself
a
favor
if
this
bottle
is
available
to
you
pick
it
up
if
not
trade
for
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
if
you
like
sours
and
flanders
definitely
give
it
a
try
slow
drinker
due
to
the
overwhelming
sourvinegar
glad
this
was
in
a
375
ml
i
dont
know
what
i
would
have
done
with
a
larger
bottle
the
first
sip
blew
both
of
us
away
as
we
quickly
fell
in
love
with
it
my
wife
who
from
this
beer
alone
has
joined
the
ranks
of
craft
beer
enthusiast
is
now
drinking
wild
ale
saisions
lambics
and
barleywines
the
flavor
was
very
sour
but
not
to
the
point
where
it
left
no
flavor
quit
the
opposite
the
flavors
plowed
threw
our
taste
buds
with
the
carbonation
at
a
perfect
level
to
achieve
this
move
after
my
second
sip
i
removed
my
self
to
use
the
washroom
and
came
back
to
an
empty
bottle
the
wife
had
no
look
of
guilt
but
of
satisfaction
which
she
now
pays
for
with
the
shipping
of
these
types
of
beers
as
it
is
little
to
find
in
my
area
drinkabilty
this
is
a
sipper
once
a
year
session
beer
its
very
good
for
the
style
but
hell
i
didnt
even
want
to
finish
my
glass
let
alone
whole
beer
its
too
intense
no
way
i
could
drink
2
its
good
experence
and
i
will
drink
again
probily
next
year
d
gets
easier
to
drink
as
it
goes
i
have
to
think
a
couple
bottles
would
tear
up
your
stomach
though
mouthfeel
is
dry
light
not
sticky
at
all
a
little
effervescent
i
couldnt
session
any
beer
this
tart
but
its
a
pleasant
tasty
beer
d
despite
the
sourness
i
find
it
very
easy
to
drink
tart
and
sweet
and
an
absolute
joy
and
privilege
to
drink
drinkability
is
fairly
good
a
classic
american
wild
brew
missing
some
intangibles
from
a
belgian
sour
lack
of
earthiness
overall
good
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
not
getting
the
hype
overall
this
is
one
sour
beer
like
i
expected
anything
less
but
a
great
beer
at
that
rr
is
amazing
with
their
sours
as
they
are
just
so
damn
good
i
might
like
consecration
better
but
this
is
one
great
beer
too
batch
04x5
d
perfect
i
could
drink
much
more
than
rr
would
suggest
for
all
the
sour
its
still
highly
drinkable
after
the
medium
body
nicely
carbonated
brew
goes
through
it
leaves
you
puckering
for
more
at
7

thats
not
hard
only
problem
is
the
price
34
finger

small

funk
not
picking
up
a

of

features
a

upfront
a
bit
more
tart
than
sour
funky

musty
some
floral
hops
but
not
much
bitterness
not

puckering
sour
mouthfeel
just
on
the
light
side
of
medium
pretty
sticky
drinkability
is
good
for
style
but
dont
want
to
do
multiple
glasses
re
palate
fatigue
complex
and
certainly
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
d
sharp
and
bitter
making
it
tough
to
do
more
than
sip
a
bit
definitely
couldnt
drink
a
whole
bottle
not
to
blaspheme
and
im
sure
this
isnt
a
bad
bottle
but
this
just
didnt
deliver
on
the
promise
of
what
i
know
to
be
a
good
beer
a
mild
disappointment
d
consider
me
impressed
i
would
consider
this
a
sessionable
sour
totally
excellent
batch

massive
thanks
goes
out
to
gcurlow
for
hooking
this
one
up
for

and
i
to
tick
served
from

into
a

snifter
poured
bright
orange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
wood
fruit
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
funk
wood
tart
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
great
brew
still
i
have
been
lucky
to
try
this
one
multiple
times
and
have
never
been
disappointed
while
this
one
did
carry
a
slightly
different
flavor
and
aroma
there
really
wasnt
a
huge
difference
between
the
two
batches
ive
reviewed
however
the
carbonation
seemed
to
have
dropped
off
a
little
bit
on
this
one
as
it
was
a
little
older
still
definitely
one
of

overall
im
literally
thinking
about
moving
out
to
santa
rosa
just
so
i
can
go
to
the
russian
river
brewpub
and
drink
this
every
day
d
a
nice
sour
indeed
plenty
of
funk
and
other
good
wild
notes
not
as
sour
as
i
would
have
liked
but
ive
found
that
to
be
the
case
with
most
rr
sours
i
like
this
one
better
than
consecration
and
temptation
bt
not
as
much
as
some
other
sours
out
there
i
would
certainly
drinkbuy
this
one
again
if
i
had
the
chance
but
wouldnt
go
too
crazy
trying
to
get
it
d
very
high
i
would
drink
this
by
the
pitcher
if
it
were
possible
a
really
great
beer
i
love
sours
and
this
one
is
no
exception
however
i
dont
think
it
is
the
sour
that
all
others
should
be
judged
by
the
flavor
is
so
concentrated
with
fresh
juiced
tart
cherry
and
light
sweet
flavors
w
dry
tannic
fruit
skin
notes
the
mild
pielike
cherry
flavor
is
sweet
and
acidic
at
the
same
time
giving
a
mildly
astringent
effect
on
the
palate
w
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
but
only
slight
and
the
oak
gives
a
mild
olive
like
bitter
oily
element
to
the
fruity
sour
in
the
flavor
there
is
mild
hop
spice
to
accent
all
the
oak
and
berry
complexity
this
is
a
fantastic
wild
ale
so
surpremely
drinkable
which
as
chris
lively
said
vinnie
attempted
a
flavor
akin
to
aged
orval
and
he
definitely
achieved
that
the
flavor
and
drinkabililty
go
above
and
beyond
i
was
sad
when
i
noticed
it
kicked
in
only
a
couple
hours
so
much
cherry
goodness
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
sourness
and
the
tartness
are
well
balanced
the
body
is
light
and
very
refreshing
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
the
beer
disappeared
from
my
glass
way
too
fast
this
beer
is
an
american
classic
extremely
drinkable
delicious
sour
ale
the
beer
poured
to
be
an
amber
color
and
it
had
fairly
strong
aroma
of
cherries
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
was
light
in
body
this
beer
was
extraordinary
and
was
easy
to
drink
i
loved
this
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
an
absolutely
top
notch
beer
each
time
ive
had
this
beer
i
get
more
and
more
impressed
with
it
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anybody
that
can
get
their
hands
on
it
i
was
not
able
to
write
detailed
notes
on
this
one
but
i
plan
to
next
time
i
get
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
one
again
i
am
not
scared
of
the
sour
just
yet
d
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
a
sour
everything
is
so
well
balanced
that
it
makes
it
easy
to
drink
the
whole
way
through
really
cant
wait
to
stock
up
on
a
few
bottles
of
this
baby
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
alcohol
texture
and
tannins
long
smooth
finish
very
enjoyable
this
brew
pours
a
light
burnt
amber
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
finger
head
with
nice
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
a
combination
of
soursour
cherriesred
grapessour
funk
and
oakit
has
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
which
is
nicely
carbonated
and
has
flavours
of
sour
red
grapes
first
up
followed
by
red
berriesplums
and
finishes
off
with
a
dry
sour
cherrywoodoak
sour
red
apple
bitterness
which
is
quite
dry
and
mouthpuckering
and
for
me
i
could
drink
it
all
night
if
only
i
had
more
than
the
one
bottle
and
overall
the
only
thing
ive
got
to
say
is
that
russian
rivers
brews
should
be
available
to
our
shores
all
the
time
its
such
a
shame
that
this
fine
brewery
cannot
do
what
rogue
does
and
let
us
sample
these
exciting
fine
brews
constantly
other
than
that
i
really
like
this
brew
and
could
not
knock
it
cheers
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
nice
and
tart
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
wonderful
complex
aromas
and
flavors
combine
to
make
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
never
gets
old
the
acidity
is
a
little
on
the
high
side
but
with
sours
its
hard
to
complain
about
that
this
may
be
my
favorite
american
wild
ale
as
a
belgian
lambic
fan
im
usually
let
down
by
american
wilds
not
the
case
here
lighter
medium
bodied
very
nice
carbonation
which
isnt
overdone
plenty
of
dryness
in
the
feel
drinks
incredibly
well
and
the
alcohol
is
just
right
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
if
they
werent
so
expensive
batch
4
bottle
pours
a
clear
light
red
with
an
orangepeach
tint
and
a
fairly
sustaining
head
nose
is
quite
a
lot
of
wet
ripe
cherries
not
as
sour
as
i
remembered
fieldlike
almost
very
fresh
and
floral
flavor
is
darker
sour
cherries
brett
tart
and
long
on
the
finish
sour
and
dry
a
tad
bit
mineral
like
in
the
mid
palate
brett
is
nicely
intertwined
and
body
is
effervescent
as
with
most
russian
river
sours
more
sour
and
expressive
than
this
batch
was
at
a
younger
age
drink
this
is
a
sipper
let
it
sit
and
warm
gradually
as
you
work
your
way
through
the
beer
it
can
last
forever
and
never
goes
bad
but
hardly
what
i
would
call
easy
drinking
d
relatively
new
to
sours
but
this
one
is
my
favorite
of
the
ones
ive
tasted
to
date
theres
a
pleasant
wine
and
oak
flavors
that
linger
in
the
mouth
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
leaving
you
wanting
more
appears
nearly
as
beautiful
as
possible
solid
it
smells
moderately
of
funk
with
a
little
bit
of
cherries
poking
through
however
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
feel
like
i
have
a
cherry
pie
in
front
of
me
fresh
out
of
the
oven
as
soon
as
i
taste
it
its
a
muted
cherry
but
flavorful
and
tart
it
feels
wonderful
as
when
you
swish
it
in
your
mouth
it
just
explodes
with
deliciousness
i
feel
less
obligated
to
specify
individual
specific
characteristics
of
this
beer
and
rather
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
seek
it
out
ill
be
enjoying
a
second
one
tonite
excellent
beer
the
taste
is
awesome
sour
but
so
so
balanced
this
beer
is
nearly
perfect
as
far
as
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
great
fun
beer
to
drink
i
guess
thats
the
best
way
to
describe
it
definitely
want
again
once
you
become
accustomed
to
its
puckering
aspects
your
taste
buds
are
in
for
a
complex
revolving
treat
there
is
amazing
flavor
here
and
the
relatively
moderate
7
5
will
leave
you
somewhat
coherent
by
the
end
of
your
glass
ill
be
drinking
this
as
often
as
i
can
overall
the
tannin
and
sourness
mellow
as
the
drink
warms
a
little
which
i
like
the
sourness
really
wakes
up
the
palate
which
i
also
like
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
a
night
the
flavors
are
bold
and
delicious
just
flat
out
different
tasty
and
i
want
more
the
abv
even
feels
elegantly
understated
allowing
for
a
sippable
but
endlessly
dynamic
ale
d
this
is
an
all
around
great
sour
you
have
the
nice
big
puckering
qualities
paired
perfectly
with
cherries
and
just
enough
brett
to
really
keep
things
interesting
conclusion
im
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
one
of
these
beers
again
a
huge
huge
thank
you
to
the
guy
who
hooked
me
up
with
this
between
hwwty4
and
tolann
ive
now
gotten
to
try
two
of
russian
rivers
most
highlytouted
beers
pliny
the
elder
absolutely
blew
me
away
it
was
everything
i
expected
and
more
this
did
not
have
quite
the
same
effect
but
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
the
aromas
are
absolutely
out
of
this
world
one
of
the
best
wild
brews
ive
encountered
the
flavors
are
very
nice
here
as
well
the
sourness
here
wasnt
a
problem
for
me
it
was
lightly
puckering
and
just
about
right
imo
the
flavors
were
very
nice
if
i
could
change
one
thing
it
would
be
to
just
ratchet
the
woodsy
dryness
back
a
bit
d
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
and
if
the
sour
complexity
didnt
grab
the
attention
so
well
375ml
would
be
gone
very
quickly
while
its
not
a
big
beer
this
is
certainly
one
to
nurse
the
more
time
you
spend
with
it
i
feel
that
this
is
a
less
interesting
but
potentially
more
quality
brew
very
very
good
it
was
just
beautifully
pleasant
and
earthy
the
aging
in
pinot
barrels
brings
out
some
trace
winelike
flavors
this
really
is
a
beautiful
beer

this
is
a
bug
bomb
and
i
love
it
if
your
looking
for
a
complex
and
layered
sour
this
is
for
you
different
then
years
past
ive
noticed
a
very
interesting
herbal
nuance
that
has
been
arising

nice
and
pretty
much
what
i
expected
cherries
with
tons
of
nuanced
flavor
and
smell
i
could
see
it
pairing
well
with
a
lot
of
different
foods
mussels
and
could
stand
on
its
own
beautiful

all

the
taste
follows
this

but
consecration
is
still
tops
for
me
when

comes

tions

but
this
one
toes
the
line
uncomfortably
close
to
wine
territory
in
my
view
the
dominant
flavors
here
are
so
yo
know
its
dry
and
puckering
as
said
before
i
really
need
to
mess
around
with
this
style

tons
of

lacing
aroma
of
fresh
butter
vinegar
tart
cherries
rotten
apples
wow
this
is
complex
taste
is
quite
different
at
first
its
very
sour
with
tart
cherries
then
i
get
some
applegrape
sweetness
and
oak
flavors
it
finishes
with
a
lemony
dry
and
sour
lingering
finish
palate
is
hard
to
describe
it
is
both
dry
from
the
sourness
yet
it
also
has
something
sticky
sweet
about
it
too
a
truly
unique
experience
another
great
sour
from
russian
river
damn
tasty
brew
pours
a
lighter
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
foam
head
has
an
aroma
of
vinegar
and
cherries
has
a
nice
frothy
medium
mouthfeel
has
a
sour
taste
with
some
bitters
and
notes
of
cherries
really
enjoyed
this
sour
d
for
such
a
tart
beer
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
d
this
brew
has
almost
everything
i
look
for
in
the
style
just
phenomenal
it
is
a
beer
like
this
that
makes
a
brewery
worldfamous
after
letting
it
breathe
and
adding
a
little
more
of
the
yeasty
goodness
supplication
becomes
even
more
complex
with
more
high
notes
and
incredible
mouth
sizzle
adding
in
the
lees
really
takes
the
sour
cherry
down
a
peg
without
losing
the
oakfueled
finish
a
wonderful
beer
i
had
on
tap
at
local
44
during
beer
week
this
was
the
last
beer
we
had
in
our
session
and
im
glad
because
not
much
really
stands
up
to
the
acidity
and
flavor
of
this
beer
it
has
beautiful
bouquet
with
fresh
cherry
and
grape
notes
with
toasted
oak
barnyard
and
sharp
acid
the
taste
was
very
much
wine
like
with
an
interesting
combination
of
both
fresh
and
aged
character
there
was
low
apparent
bitterness
that
seemed
to
get
lost
in
the
tartness
but
that
was
enough
to
just
provide
balance
the
grape
and
cherry
fruit
flavors
dominate
this
beer
with
the
bret
and
wild
character
providing
a
background
of
interest
this
was
a
great
beer
to
share
because
at
10
oz
i
think
this
is
the
most
i
could
drink
before
i
would
no
longer
be
able
to
taste
the
different
individual
flavors
and
my
palate
was
shot
at
7
0
abv
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
with
how
quickly
the
sourness
dissipates
in
your
mouth
leaving
you
with
the
slight
scent
of
cherry
and
malt
to
encourage
you
to
take
another
sip
drinkability
with
the
sourness
and
dry
finish
it
is
easy
to
drink
each
finish
begs
the
next
sip
until
the
bottle
is
gone
d
this
most
definitely
lives
up
to
its
reputation
crazy
complex
and
delicious
this
is
a
really
easy
beer
to
drink
and
is
flavorful
but
it
did
wreck
my
palate
this
is
deserving
of
the
hype
it
has
i
certainly
had
high
expectations
for
this
one
and
it
didnt
disappoint
im
not
an
expert
on
sourwild
ales
but
i
cant
imagine
there
are
many
better
than
this
on
the
landscape
of
american
made
wild
ales
find
one
of
these
and
drink
it
as
soon
as
you
can
for
a
sour
this
has
great
drinkability
i
could
easily
grab
another
thank
you

keep
up
the
quality

amazing

with
a
one
and

quickly
fades

remains

sour

sour
cherries
and
ripe

up

followed
by
a
funky
mustiness
and
some
alcohol
heat
the
aftertaste
is
rich
in
bread
sweet
cherries
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
a
lingering
sour
must
a
drinkable
beer
a
small
head
shows
beige
over
amber
and
tanned
hues
aromas
are
sour
and
acidic
theyre
undeniably
fruity
but
i
am
not
confident
that
its
quite
cherry
but
a
pull
from
my
glass
tells
another
story
the
flavors
are
hugely
sour
a
massive
wop
of
cherries
explodes
in
my
mouth
tingles
tickles
and
makes
me
pucker
the
cherries
are
really
sublime
though
the
oak
offers
an
earthiness
that
does
well
to
balance
it
out
enough
that
i
dont
want
to
call
this
a
lambic
as
i
sip
i
notice
the
froth
is
retaining
and
lacing
the
glass
which
is
always
something
i
like
to
take
note
of
vinous
and
flavorful
this
ale
isnt
too
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
i
love
a
good
sour
and
this
one
is
done
wonderfully
i
cant
wait
to
try
future
batches
very
easy
drinking
and
definitely
a
beer
made
for
pairing
with
food
supplication
is
most
impressive
in
that
the
extreme
tartness
doesnt
subside
over
time
ive
been
trying
to
treat
it
as
a
sipper
but
it
keeps
drawing
me
in
i
fear
ive
gone
through
it
too
quickly
this
is
a
fine
beer
id
love
to
give
it
another
consideration
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
off

smell
is
tart

funk
oak
and
vanilla
taste
is

oak
and
some

medium
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
sour
that
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
d
i
can
see
why
this
beer
comes
in
a
375
it
is
the
perfect
amount
of
this
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
but
leaves
me
wanting
it
again
rr

yet
to
disappoint

d
lovey
sour

im
glad

a
regular

can
get
bored

the

very

in

ill

it
all

i
would
drink
it
in
a
box
i
would
drink
it
with
a
fox
i
would
drink
it
in
a
house
i
would
drink
it
with
a
mouse
i
love
it
and
despite
the
alcohol
which
is
hidden
well
i
could
crush
this
daily
and
never
get
bored
no
it
is
not
the
beer
for
every
drinker
but
if
this
is
what
you
crave
then
it
will
give
up
its
bounty
with
glee
and
make
you
among
the
happiest
imbibers
out
there
its
balanced
on
a
knifes
edge
between
the
sweet
and
the
sour
with
the
earthy
goodness
that
damp
fertile
soil
of
a
barnyard
will
provide
you
it
has
a
manageable
abv
and
it
drinks
as
though
it
were
devoid
of
anything
that
would
caution
you
to
have
a
care
not
only
do
i
appreciate
the
style
i
appreciate
everything
it
entails
its
beers
like
this
that
make
it
oh
so
easy
to
do
exactly
that
overall
i
wish
i
had
a
375ml
to
myself
who
am
i
kidding
i
wish
it
was
a
growler
a
perfect
balance
of
sour
and
sweet
to
keep
you
wanting
another
sip
a
simply
spectacular
beer
d
the
375
ml
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
any
one
person
i
would
imagine
but
the
beer
still
causes
mouthwatering
just
thinking
about
it
between
each
sip
so
delicious
despite
the
heavy
flavor
and
feel
on
the
tongue
about
half
a
finger
of
light
tan
to
offwhite
foam
spreads
across
the
surface

a
fairly
loose
knit
all
tiny

goes
quickly
but
easily
regained
with
a
swirl
or
two
average

the
liquid
is
noticeably
clear

orange

some
loss
of
hue
around
the
rims
plenty
of
active
bubbles
visible
within
the
sour

in

lees

oats
rosemary
and

with

and
animality
the
pureness
of
the
cherry
outlasts
all
the
rest
mediumbodied
with
a
very
strong
foaminess
this
almost
necessary
to
help
you
palate
acclimate
to
the
unrelenting
sourness
of
the
cherry
fruit
yeast
lees
tar
and
a
sherrylike
nuttiness
fill
in
many
of
the
open
spaces
very
dry
one
of
the
drier
beers
consumed
in

as
mouth
yields
to
it
more
raspberry
nectarine
and
lemon
zest
flavors
appear
hard
to
track
any
change
as
it
warms
so
pervasive
is
the
sourness
a
great
experience
brew
but
not
one
im
jonesing
to
try
again
any
time
soon
drinkability
this
beer
is
truely
great
stuff
while
its
hard
to
really
put
this
stuff
down
to
quickly
its
not
hard
to
finish
a
glass
or
two
like
i
said
about
consecration
this
is
a
special
occasion
type
of
brew
d
a
wonderful
wild
what
i
love
about
it
is
how
balanced
and
harmonious
it
is
not
one
character
overpowers
the
other
but
together
just
creates
an
awesome
beer
i
did
not
want
my
glass
to
end
drinkability
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
one
bottle
is
sufficient
in
a
session
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
pleasing
wild
ale
which
seems
simple
yet
complex
all
the
way
through
maybe
it
just
confused
my
palate
though
since
i
havent
had
too
many
wild
ales
this
is
a
tasty
ale
to
say
the
least
medium
to
highly
carbonated
with
a
light
body
which
accentuates
the
refreshing
character
of
this
beer
overall
an
extremely
well
crafted
sour
top
notch
very
unique
and
complex
beer
comments
a
great
beer
with
fine
complexity
russian
river
is
making
some
topnotch
brews
i
have
been
lucky
enough
to
enjoy
two
bottles
of
this
wonderful
beer
taste
of
strong
brett
flavors
granny
smith
apples
tart
cherry
and
drier
than
a
desert
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
brett
flavors
are
stronger
than
temptation
which
i
thought
i
liked
more
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
from
malts
that
i
can
pick
up
among
the
battering
ram
of
funk
among
the
funk
some
oak
is
definitely
present
mouthfeel
is
on
the
medium
side
with
a
heavy
dosing
of
carbonation
i
am
under
the
assumption
tums
will
be
on
the
menu
later
today
d
very
drinkable
this
sour
was
refreshing
and
a
really
great
beer
wished
i
had
more
but
my
stomach
was
about
to
punch
me
in
the
face
if
i
drank
anymore
sour
beer
a
great
ending
to
an
epic
sour
tasting
that
i
will
never
forget
d
considering
the
punch
packed
in
the
first
sip
im
shocked
to
see
how
easy
this
has
become
to
drink
after
10
minutes
while
a
growler
of
this
might
be
intimidating
im
having
no
problem
enjoying
every
last
drop
of
this
bottle
also
this
was
my
first
sour
so
i
was
a
bit
nervous
about
what
i
would
find
i
had
heard
that
this
is
an
excellent
starter
sour
so
im
glad
to
have
received
this
one
mjmadden
came
up
huge
for
me
with
this
brew
thanks
again
d
really
awesome
beer
had
a
375
and
wish
it
was
a
750
wave
of
subdued
oak
the
brettanomyces
funk
works
against
these
extreme
flavors
to
provide
an
earthy
balance
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
bright
sharp
carbonation
a
sour
ale
that
slaps
you
in
the
face
and
demands
your
attention
batch

a
nice

bottle
of
this
even
my
wife
was
impressed
and
asked
where
she
could
pick
some
up
ill

start
working

ive

very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
this
beer
is
so
intense
that
it
lends
itself
more
to
being
a
sipper
d
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
acetic
notes
in
wild
ales
but
not
to
the
point
that
they
destroy
the
complexity
of
the
beer
i
dont
dislike
this
supplication
i
just
wouldnt
go
through
such
lengths
to
acquire
it
again
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
finest
sourstyle
ales
ive
ever
had
the
privilege
of
tasting
d
i
really
enjoy
the
sour
and
dry
character
of
this
beer
and
having
split
two
12
68
bottles
in
separate
sittings
i
would
certainly
classify
this
brew
as
a
drawn
out
tasting
sipper
this
is
by
far
the
most
original
and
exciting
beer
that
i
have
had
in
awhile
and
it
really
shocked
and
delighted
my
taste
buds
what
a
great
beer
d
fantastic
beer
would
love
to
have
frequent
access
to
it
so
i
could
bury
it
in
my
cellar
for
about
a
dozen
or
so
years
and
see
what
would
happen
the
tartness
my
be
a
bit
overpowering
for
those
not
expecting
it
and
gives
you
pause
between
each
sip
to
let
your
tongue
recover
which
i
suppose
isnt
such
a
bad
thing
as
it
lets
additional
flavors
to
develop
in
the
finish
a
somewhat
confused
thumbs
up
on
this
one
thank
you
matt
at
capones
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
and
a
few
more
treats
from
rr
on
a
recent
philly
visit
this
is
another
one
that
several
of
us
were
looking
forward
to
opening
upon
opening
the
bottle
there
was
a
nice
pop
from
pulling
the
cork
and
the
aroma
of
sour
cherries
and
sour
fruit
fill
your
nose
and
make
you
want
to
pucker
up
a
little
pours
a
brilliant
red
with
good
carbonation
and
a
mild
light
pink
head
the
initial
taste
is
that
of
strong
sour
fruit
and
it
lingers
for
a
while
before
living
the
mouth
takes
you
back
to
the
days
of
sucking
on
sour
worms
and
war
heads
until
you
tongue
was
sore
liquid
candy
was
how
many
people
described
it
this
beer
is
a
solid
5
d
hmmm
i
would
have
to
say
drinkability
suffers
because
of
acidity
a
whole
375
ml
gave
me
a
little
heartburn
additionally
any
sour
can
become
tiresome
to
the
palate
excellent
beer
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
it
a
world
class
sour
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
strangely
i
think
it
would
be
really
good
mixed
with
iced
tea
like
an
arnold
palmer
though
that
would
be
disrespectful
to
supplication
the
complexity
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
this
is
a
treat
overall
i
think
this
is
just
the
tiniest
step
up
from
consecration
its
impossible
to
describe
but
i
feel
as
though
its
a
tiny
bit
more
complex
in
the
funk
department
either
way
both
are
extraordinary
and
well
worth
a
shot
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
tried
temptation
supplication
and
consecration
all
in
one
night
and
thought
supplication
was
the
best
by
far
would
love
to
try
again
o
this
is
unique
and
delicious
proof
that
if
you
take
the
care
in
brewing
a
beer
you
would
in
creating
a
fine
wine
the
results
can
be
just
as
mind
blowing
d
is
really
good
i
like
this
a
lot
i
cared
for
the
consecration
even
more
i
would
have
no
problem
at
all
drinking
muliples
of
this
amazing
brew
so
consistent
a
lot
of
beers
have
a
great
nose
but
fail
to
back
it
up
in
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
everything
is
in
sync
here
gets
better
with
each
progression
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
for
any
wild
is
a
little
on
the
lower
side
for
me
due
to
the
palate
wrecking
sourness
but
this
one
is
really
quite
nice
i
would
have
no
problem
taking
down
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
one
overall
probably
my
favorite
sour
to
date
really
enjoyed
my
sample
and
am
excited
to
have
one
of
my
own
skal
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
this
is
completely
different
from
what
i
drink
but
its
delicious
and
a
wonderful
change
of
pace
sourness
and
price
may
affect
drinkability
but
for
this
style
this
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
refreshing
every
sip
left
me
yearning
for
more
i
finished
this
too
quickly
this
is
only
my
3rd
sour
ive
had
so
im
no
expert
but
goddamn
this
was
a
good
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
russian
rivers
other
sours
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
had
fine
carbonation
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
and
found
i
craved
another
badly
the
very
next
day
golden
brown
color
tart
cherry
smell
with
a
bit
of
funk
in
the
nose
but
not
much
mostly
wood
and
cherries
the
taste
offered
ripe
juicy
cherries
winesoaked
oak
and
tart
sour
cherry
skins
mouthfeel
was
superb
moderate
carbonation
with
big
bubbles
a
nice
dry
fruity
finish
highly
recommended
an
outstanding
sour
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
this
has
to
be
the
best
sour
i
have
had
from
rr
i
would
suggest
this
beer
to
anyone
that
wants
to
be
blown
away
from
a
already
amazing
style
poured
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
limited
amount
of
white
head
that
dissovled
quickly
and
left
a
faint
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
nose
is
a
fruity
sourness
that
is
somewhat
reminescent
of
oranges
taste
is
tart
funky
sour
and
includes
a
bit
of
the
previously
hinted
fruitiness
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
it
has
quite
a
dry
finish
as
it
warms
my
palate
becomes
increasingly
perplexed
as
i
pick
up
on
tastes
of
funky
must
coupled
with
dry
fruits
nearly
applelike
but
sour
like
a
green
apple
candy
brett
is
apparent
in
both
smell
and
taste
without
being
dominating
each
sip
is
so
drying
and
puckering
that
it
is
hard
to
stop
put
down
the
glass
and
stop
salivating
this
is
a
very
interesting
beverage
that
i
found
enjoyable
and
another
example
of
a
style
im
not
quite
familiar
with
but
really
enjoy
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
o
this
sour
is
amazing
on
tap
its
epic
but
that
will
wait
for
another
review
down
the
road
get
this
beer
if
you
enjoy
a
nice
sour
fix
d
very
high
on
the
drinkability
but
i
have
a
feeling
enjoying
a
second
one
in
a
sitting
wouldnt
give
the
beer
its
due
incredibly
easy
as
this
basically
disappears
in
your
mouth
the
sourness
would
wears
on
me
a
bit
but
it
is
incredibly
enjoyable
definitely
in
that
upper
echelon
of
beers
for
me
highly
recommended
exceptional
beer
seriously
fantastic
i
have
fallen
off
the
deep
end
into
a
deep
love
of
well
brewed
sour
beers
wow
this
is
good
the
one
small
bottle
i
purchased
was
12
50
so
it
is
somewhat
pricey
however
this
is
a
beer
i
can
see
myself
buying
plenty
more
of
in
the
future
on
special
occasions
body
is
good
for
the
style
although
i
found
it
a
bit
thin
drinkability
was
good
depending
your
tolerance
for
sourness
overall
a
good
beer
worth
a
shot
for
anyone
and
a
must
try
for
sourheads
100th
review
popped
the
cork
and
the
beer
almost
foamed
out
all
over
the
place
luckily
i
had
a
glass
ready
this
beer
pours
a
lovely
dark
mahogany
with
a
slightly
tan
head
that
sticks
around
in
clumps
and
leaves
wonderful
lace
surprising
that
it
is
not
more
carbonated
given
the
fact
that
it
was
a
gusher
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
and
full
of
sour
cherries
vinegar
funk
and
earthiness
taste
is
very
sour
and
very
delicious
puckering
and
complex
pinot
noir
tart
cherry
woodiness
some
wine
like
tannins
lemon
like
citrus
there
is
just
so
much
going
on
more
vinegar
than
lactic
acid
but
both
come
into
play
there
is
some
alcoholic
warmth
in
there
as
well
and
it
plays
off
the
other
flavors
the
finish
is
long
super
tart
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
this
is
one
to
savor
a
fine
sour
from
an
amazing
brewery
thank
you
goes
out
to
b
rob
for
this
one
brett
e
funk
im
not
even
gonna
follow
the
typical
review
order
this
is
my
favorite
beer
so
far
it
was
my
first
sour
and
you
always
remember
your
first
ha
hi
sb
it
looked
like
an
ipa
with
a
little
bit
of
redness
in
it
the
taste
is
amazing
i
almost
cant
describe
it
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
as
many
wild
ales
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
due
to
this
i
cant
stop
thinking
about
this
beer
its
bordering
on
obsession
definitely
one
to
seek
out
also
it
has
a
cherry
taste
d
yea
i
could
drink
all
my
money
away
on
this
beer
and
probably
be
pretty
satisfied
with
my
investment
dead
and
dying
from
starvation
but
enjoying
some
extremely
fine
brew
ive
been
borderline
bumping
up
a
couple
stats
so
ill
say
5
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
for
being
so
tart
its
kinda
hard
for
me
to
get
down
but
pretty
drinnkable
for
a
sour
fedubbelfist
with
a
look
as
hard
as
nails
needs
to
say
nothing
at
all
the
bartender
realizes
hes
asked
a
stupid
question
and
serves
him
another
on
the
house
d
i
did
have
some
trouble
with
this
beer
not
the
beers
fault
i
am
unaccustomed
to
the
style
and
still
have
my
training
wheels
on
this
beer
really
opened
up
a
whole
new
world
for
me
in
my
opinion
is
definitely
a
sipper
there
is
crazy
stuff
going
on
here
and
i
will
soon
grow
into
my
pants
and
be
able
to
run
free
in
this
wild
pasture
one
of
the
best
examples
of
american
artisan
brewing
to
have
met
our
palates
period
dont
bother
pairing
this
one
with
any
food
its
to
be
indulged
in
on
its
own
batch
002
is
on
sale
now
at
their
website
11
and
theyll
ship
to
about
half
of
the
states
in
the
us
d
great
beer
375ml
is
just
about
right
unless
shared
i
shared
a
few
drinks
with
my
wife
this
beer
has
phenomenal
flavor
sour
up
front
with
bitterness
following
and
a
long
lingering
and
delicious
aftertaste
of
fruit
and
spice
absolutely
wonderful
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
also
robust
and
spoton
for
the
beer
russian
river
has
delivered
again
while
this
is
certainly
no
chugging
or
session
beer
i
would
have
loved
to
crack
open
another
bottle
and
sip
my
way
through
it
very
drinkable
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
love
it
a
prolific
beer
from
a
prolific
brewer
supplication
is
a
musthave
for
any
lover
of
sours
browns
or
the
finer
things
in
life
pours
a
brownish
amber
with
some
haze
and
beautiful
white
head
that
rose
with
little
effort
on
the
pour
nose
has
a
fruit
dessertlike
aroma
with
a
little
lime
on
the
palate
theres
plenty
of
vinegary
passion
fruit
sweet
malt
wile
sour
flavors
and
a
tangy
sweet
fruity
finish
incredibly
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
no
unpleasant
aspects
of
the
barnyardish
character
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
lot
at
first
sip
i
was
unsure
of
it
but
as
i
drank
more
and
more
i
came
to
appreciate
this
gem
consumed
3312010
not
sure
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
a
glass
here
or
there
would
bean
excellent
treat
when
i
poured
it
into
my
tulip
glass
the
active
carbonation
danced
and
propped
up
a
frothy
head
i
expected
the
added
cherries
would
have
the
overly
sweetened
bar
cherry
flavor
this
is
not
the
case
the
cherries
taste
just
as
natural
as
if
i
had
picked
them
from
the
tree
myself
and
the
wood
from
the
oak
barrel
aging
adds
a
layer
of
complexity
to
the
flavor
thats
just
right
what
is
most
interesting
about
this
beer
and
what
i
enjoyed
the
most
was
the
sourness
of
it
when
you
finish
your
sip
the
tartness
begs
you
to
take
another
and
leaves
your
mouth
watering
for
more
i
picked
this
up
at
pinnochios
in
media
17
for
375
ml
i
poured
into
a
snifter
light
amber
in
color
with
a
medium
white
head
there
was
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
vinous
it
is
full
of
sour
cherries
and
oak
it
has
a
perfect
cherry
flavor
the
tartness
of
the
cherries
and
funk
of
the
brett
meld
perfectly
in
this
one
it
finishes
dry
and
has
a
little
sweetness
to
it
the
beer
is
a
lightmedium
in
body
with
mild
carbonation
for
me
this
is
a
great
sipper
the
best
sour
i
have
had
to
date
the
smell
of
this
beer
alone
is
enough
to
give
you
a
pleasant
high
or
atleast
it
is
for
me
redishorange
color
with
little
to
no
head
in
the
pour
but
lots
and
lots
of
carbonation
it
seemed
as
though
the
beer
mustve
had
a
thousand
different
flavors
it
was
so
delicious
the
main
flavor
that
stuck
out
to
me
had
a
sour
citrus
feel
that
just
burst
in
your
mouth
i
can
only
imagine
the
type
of
alcoholic
i
would
become
if
this
beer
was
readily
available
to
me
basically
this
beer
taste
like
heaven
if
you
havent
tried
i
would
suggest
you
do
so
asap
d
is
very
high
the
flavors
change
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
and
it
just
keeps
getting
more
interesting
the
more
you
drink
it
d
mighty
tasty
i
must
say
while
i
would
want
to
drink
this
quite
often
i
couldnt
exactly
down
a
whole
bottle
375
or
750
for
that
matter
im
still
a
bit
of
a
rookie
with
sours
but
this
is
the
top
2
along
with
sui
generis
for
me
worth
the
money
for
a
nice
long
really
well
made
sipper
beer
this
was
equally
fun
to
smell
as
it
was
to
drink
overall
this
is
definitely
an
easy
drinker
which
might
be
surprising
for
such
an
extreme
mouth
shocker
equally
shocking
the
weight
of
the
bottle
this
is
one
heavy
bottle
for
such
a
small
volume
of
beer
totally
worth
the
price
to
try
but
i
dont
think
id
penny
up
another
20
as
id
rather
try
other
russian
river
offerings
first
i
need
more
rerate

the
supplication
09
looked
pretty
much
the
same
except
a
shade
lighter
its
nose
was
not
as
pungent
at
all
compared
to
the
07
the
taste
is
more
fresh
bing
cherries
more
oak
and
less
sour
pucker
i
got
some
pucker
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
but
it
has
much
more
fruit
compared
to
the
07
if
you
are
new
to
sours
this
one
would
be
a
good
one
to
try
its
not
as
full
bodied
as
the
07
but
it
tastes
more
fruity
and
oak
dave
liked
the
09
better
however
i
appreciated
the
more
sourness
you
got
out
of
the
07
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
more
atainable
than
others
makes
it
even
better
if
you
have
not
had
this
you
must
try
it
d
this
beer
is
chuggable
and
dangerous
i
wish
i
had
an
entire
cellar
full
of
this
easily
one
of
the
best
and
most
enjoyable
beers
i
have
ever
had
overall
russian
river
doesnt
disappoint
with
this
one
is
it
better
than
isabelle
some
may
say
so
but
i
dont
think
so
in
a
year
or
two
however
this
bottle
will
probably
be
much
better
so
look
at
it
whichever
way
you
want
an
exceptional
beer
and
one
i
would
love
to
seek
out
in
the
future
thanks
kevin
for
opening
another
bottle
that
has
been
on
my
wants
for
some
time
d
really
good
i
could
easily
drink
a
750ml
of
this
and
go
for
more
reminds
me
of
a
smaller
la
folie
ontap
at
tjs
yesterday
in
pa
for
pliny
the
younger
and
friends
reviewed
from
notes
this
beer
was
a
life
changer
for
me
i
have
had
a
decent
amount
of
sours
but
nothing
that
remotely
compared
to
this
one
i
think
i
may
become
addicted
to
sours
in
the
next
months
just
because
i
have
always
enjoyed
very
sour
foods
anyways
served
in
a
large
flute
like
glass
pours
like
wine
with
not
much
head
or
lace
but
a
pretty
awesome
looking
orangecopper
color
the
smell
is
nice
the
lambiclike
sourfunk
notes
are
there
with
oak
and
cherries
wine
notes
come
through
and
also
grapes
this
balance
became
more
evident
as
the
beer
warmed
up
and
i
fell
in
love
with
it
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
the
real
life
changer
for
me
very
smooth
starts
out
with
an
absolutely
fantastic
amount
of
sour
fruits
the
wine
notes
hit
me
soon
after
the
aftertaste
is
what
really
killed
me
out
of
this
world
from
the
time
i
swallowed
the
beer
to
a
few
minutes
after
the
taste
of
cherries
just
grew
on
my
tongue
eventually
it
just
tasted
like
a
mouthful
of
fresh
cherries
mind
you
there
hasnt
been
beer
in
my
mouth
for
a
minute
now
the
oak
and
grape
notes
only
add
to
a
flavor
that
really
needs
no
assistance
god
the
cherries
are
so
good
mouthfeel
is
suitable
and
enhances
the
beer
for
me
the
body
is
moderate
and
nice
and
creamy
the
sour
makes
my
cheeks
pinch
but
i
like
it
a
coat
of
fruit
sour
grapes
and
cherries
stays
on
the
tongue
for
a
long
long
time
do
i
have
to
explain
the
drinkability
the
taste
was
perfect
for
the
whole
glass
the
price
was
great
i
will
never
view
sour
beers
the
same
after
this
and
will
have
a
new
standard
to
judge
them
to
i
can
only
hope
to
have
this
beer
again
sometime
in
my
life
ok
ill
be
trading
for
more
of
this
just
an
awesome
beer
to
drink
i
am
making
myself
savor
every
last
drop
however
i
want
to
consume
it
faster
as
its
just
wonderful
hats
off
again
to
russian
river
overall
this
is
one
great
brew
and
the
375ml
serving
is
perfect
its
sour
as
hell
which
could
kill
the
drinkability
in
any
bigger
of
a
containment
vessel
but
this
serving
was
just
right
becomes
incredibly
more
cherry
like
and
complex
as
it
warms
and
once
the
carbonation
has
mellowed
this
is
one
fine
beer
not
sure
if
i
like
it
more
than
consecration
but
its
another
great
from
rr
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
one
ages
d
easy
drinker
good
taste
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
by
any
means
great
beer
by
rr
overall
impression
this
beer
is
beyond
amazing
i
enjoyed
this
even
more
than
consecration
and
i
was
not
sure
that
was
possible
its
very
hard
to
find
and
its
expensive
but
you
simply
must
buy
it
if
you
see
it
once
you
taste
it
youll
forget
all
the
price
slainte
this
interesting
ale
has
a
nice
cherry
hue
cherry
aroma
and
cherry
taste
the
fine
carbonation
gives
it
a
refreshing
character
and
champagnelike
feel
really
unique
and
i
wish
we
could
get
it
in
ontario
thanks
to
jzed
once
again
for
sharing
this
rare
treat
from
california
overall
this
is
my
first
russian
river
sour
out
of
the
bottle
and
im
finding
it
to
be
pretty
awesome
lots
of
cherry
nicely
complex
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
the
american
wild
style
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
i
dont
have
a
few
to
age
in
my
cellar
keep
up
the
great
work
russian
river
d
well
my
dad
looks
like
he
is
trying
out
for
a
rolling
rock
commercial
he
just
doesnt
like
it
for
me
though
im
glad
i
was
able
to
purchase
and
consume
a
bottle
before
the
plcb
got
ahold
of
it
russian
river
continues
to
astound
me
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
a
bit
more
would
have
been
good
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
a
puckering
tannic
feeling
to
go
with
the
acidity
this
was
a
great
beer
that
i
will
try
and
have
again
splitting
this
bottle
is
ideal
another
knockout
from
russian
river
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
their
beers
may
not
like
it
quite
as
much
as
consecration
but
everyone
is
a
winner
in
that
comparison
overall
a
very
good
sour
ale
nice
orangeamber
color
half
finger
white
head
that
maintains
throughout
the
whole
glass
well
carbonated
the
smell
itself
hurts
my
jaw
and
the
sourness
has
a
great
bite
but
is
not
the
most
hardcore
ive
ever
had
instead
its
just
perfect
for
continued
drinking
cherries
pinot
and
oak
flavors
dominate
the
drinkability
is
truly
exceptional
one
of
the
best
wild
ales
ive
ever
had
d
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
trying
this
i
cant
see
drinking
it
alot
it
is
a
palette
bomb
for
sure
d
good
complexity
here
though
not
overly
so
what
does
it
for
me
with
this
beer
is
the
body
amazingly
light
invigorating
and
drinkable
it
complements
the
flavors
present
perfectly
oddly
filling
also
considering
the
light
body
it
exhausts
and
puzzles
my
palate
i
could
have
glass
after
glass
of
this
one
though
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
dpretty
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
way
too
close
to
call
between
this
and
temptation
its
a
coin
flip
situation
to
determine
which
is
better
overall
this
was
very
close
to
consecration
but
some
extra
tartness
and
oak
presence
to
sum
this
beer
up
its
like
beer
wine
and
champagne
all
in
one
i
have
to
believe
it
is
truly
one
of
a
kind
i
hope
i
am
able
to
get
my
hands
on
this
again
sometime
soon
d
surprisingly
even
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
sours
yet
i
am
liking
this
beer
the
more
sips
i
take
i
guess
thats
just
getting
used
to
the
style
i
wouldnt
drink
a
ton
of
this
but
its
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
beers
to
sip
on
for
an
occasion
overall
an
outstanding
sour
i
really
like
this
and
it
is
probably
my
favorite
russian
river
to
date
out
of
consecration
and
temptation
get
ahold
of
this
one
thanks
jeff
for
picking
this
up
and
sending
to
me
more
more
more
d
pretty
drinkable
this
was
very
interesting
and
the
flavors
all
mixed
very
well
excellent
beer
wow
what
a
nice
sour
i
was
extremely
impressed
by
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
even
remotely
likes
this
style
d
delicious
and
addictive
the
tartness
keeps
you
in
check
easy
to
savor
sip
by
sip
a
great
beer
you
want
to
take
very
small
sips
of
this
one
each
sip
brings
something
new
drinkability
very
drinkable
excellent
flavor
great
treat
all
in
all
its
another
amazing
beer
from
rr
d
slightly
more
acidic
that
i
would
like
to
the
point
where
it
had
a
burn
that
was
slightly
more
on
the
esophagus
than
most
any
sour
i
have
tasted
this
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
more
sour
or
worse
it
just
burned
a
little
other
than
that
one
downside
however
the
beer
was
extremely
drinkable
and
has
held
up
very
nicely
overall
great
offering
from
a
great
brewery
probably
best
sour
i
have
had
to
date
from
rr
awesome
drinkability
a
nice
enjoyable
drink
thanks
waltonc
bbehr
d
a
beer
like
this
just
begs
to
be
slowly
sipped
and
savored
the
problem
is
its
just
so
damn
delicious
and
balanced
the
alcohol
is
simply
nonexistent
and
balance
just
unbelievable
sitting
and
settling
for
a
few
minutes
brings
out
a
whole
new
slew
of
tastes
and
textures
certainly
holds
its
own
against
other
rr
sourswilds
d
i
will
admit
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
had
to
try
this
due
to
the
hype
the
sourness
was
a
shock
at
first
however
after
a
few
sips
it
all
came
together
and
i
could
easily
see
how
fans
of
sours
could
crush
this
and
beg
for
more
the
flavor
is
tart
cherries
wood
a
little
sweet
malt
which
i
did
not
detect
from
the
smell
and
some
funk
very
good
very
dry
and
complex
as
well
medium
bodied
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
enjoyed
from
a
375ml
bottle
batch
04x2
in
a
tulip
glass
dark
amber
in
color
with
one
finger
of
light
tan
head
fading
into
a
nice
cap
and
lacing
smells
of
oak
tart
cherries
and
funk
but
primarily
cherries
taste
is
mouth
puckeringly
tart
sour
cherries
oak
and
a
bitter
tannic
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
as
much
as
i
love
everything
about
this
beer
it
can
be
very
hard
to
drink
an
excellent
brew
all
around
overall
another
great
beer
from
russian
river
if
i
could
afford
it
i
would
love
to
try
supplication
consecration
and
temptation
in
a
sidebyside
sour
tasting
without
trying
the
latter
yet
i
have
high
expectations
after
trying
the
other
two
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
great
copper
color
with
a
minimal
beige
head
that
didnt
last
long
minor
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
great
big
burst
of
cherries
wood
and
some
funkiness
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
in
my
book
its
dominated
by
cherries
with
a
great
sourness
but
nothing
over
the
top
very
very
delicious
beer
i
felt
like
i
was
flying
through
this
beer
so
i
had
to
slow
myself
down
to
really
enjoy
it
mouthfeel
is
excellent
as
well
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
it
has
a
sort
of
champagne
quality
that
coast
your
tongue
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
in
my
opinion
feel
like
i
could
sip
on
this
all
day
long
temptation
and
consecration
were
very
good
but
i
think
supplication
is
my
favorite
of
the
3
i
will
get
more
highly
recommended
although
i
dont
think
this
is
a
session
type
beer
it
surely
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
out
there
a
must
try
for
everyone
who
enjoys
unique
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
really
great
and
pleasant
on
the
palette
it
has
a
nice
warming
feel
with
a
nice
fizzy
feel
it
goes
down
really
well
and
is
quite
refreshing
the
sweetness
is
really
light
on
the
palette
and
is
really
enjoyable
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
this
is
really
hard
to
just
let
sit
in
the
glass
it
constantly
pulls
you
back
leaving
you
quickly
wishing
there
were
5
more
of
its
sibblings
waiting
for
you
in
the
fridge
but
that
would
be
an
expensive
6
pack
now
wouldnt
it
drinkability
is
good
as
it
is
not
too
sour
or
overwhelming
alcohol
is
not
very
present
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
coats
the
whole
palate
another
good
sour
from
rr
overall
i
really
liked
this
and
i
plan
on
sitting
on
others
for
a
long
time
to
see
what
can
happen
to
this
brew
and
if
the
carbonation
would
calm
down
a
bit
overall
very
good
would
still
buy
consecration
before
this
one
though
even
temptation
too
i
think
but
either
way
i
will
buy
all
of
them
love
each
and
every
one
of
them
its
a
pucker
solid
sour
tons
of
fermented
cherries
carbonation
and
very
crisp
i
guess
i
should
mention
i
chose
to
pour
slowly
at
first
and
then
swirled
the
setiment
and
poured
in
into
my
glass
anyway
i
personally
love
the
added
flavor
theres
a
very
nice
sweet
flavor
that
rests
on
the
tongue
well
after
each
sip
a
great
sour
pours
a
cloudy
orange
tea
color
with
a
thick
stiff
foamy
white
head
that
resists
fading
leaving
a
huge
amount
of
belgian
lacing
some
3d
the
smell
is
aggressive
complex
and
fruity
classic
bing
cherries
down
to
the
unique
tart
character
the
aroma
also
has
a
sweetness
that
i
want
to
associate
with
malt
but
with
a
creamy
vanilla
note
that
i
sense
may
be
from
the
barrel
aging
full
flavored
the
tart
cherry
character
is
intense
without
being
offensive
and
in
fact
is
exceptional
visibly
effervescent
the
mouth
feel
finishes
clean
and
dry
this
is
the
most
drinkable
sour
that
ive
experienced
right
up
there
with
brute
and
lebleu
the
depth
of
the
flavors
and
aroma
of
this
one
exceeds
the
other
two
really
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
it
d
hmm
very
good
wild
ale
really
a
toss
up
between
this
and
consecration
for
my
favorite
rr
wild
and
up
there
overall
probably
adding
ithaca
brute
into
the
mix
good
blend
of
fruitiness
sour
brett
sorry
that
this
is
only
a
375ml
bottle
have
to
try
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
before
they
become
scarce
i
consumed
a
growler
of
batch
004
back
in
december
but
ive
been
told
that
a
different
blend
was
put
into
bottles
i
enjoy
this
even
more
than
the
first
blend
if
thats
possible
and
i
shall
drink
up
while
the
fruit
is
fresh
draught
at
the
brewpub
for
the
younger
release
batch
four
has
a
really
vivid
cherry
character
right
now
wth
a
ton
of
acidity
but
also
a
great
mlt
balance
that
isnt
sweet
but
provides
a
lot
of
counterbalance
to
the
sourness
just
a
ton
of
great
flavor
seems
more
fruit
forward
than
the
last
batch
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
the
bottles
of
this
batch
are
very
good
sour
perhaps
not
as
good
as
temptation
in
my
mind
which
is
just
phenomenal
but
a
very
solid
offering
worthy
of
the
price
whatever
it
may
be
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
i
did
russian
river
seemed
to
have
an
endless
supply
of
this
stuff
during
both
notb
and
session
one
i
came
back
from
multiple
samples
yep
an
excellent
beer
throughout
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
a
russian
river
wild
ale
maybe
the
best
i
have
had
from
the
brewery
which
is
saying
a
lot
worthy
of
its
praise
a
must
try
if
you
have
the
means
ok
i
like
this
beer
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
sour
not
at
all
this
was
sweet
and
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
that
accents
the
sour
notes
it
ends
rather
tart
but
overall
its
not
as
sour
as
the
other
offerings
its
citric
and
lactic
in
nature
with
a
pretty
dominant
sweetness
overall
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
high
still
a
great
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
a
real
treat
its
a
given
that
you
will
wish
this
had
come
in
750s
its
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
comparable
in
quality
to
the
best
belgian
lambics
i
have
no
doubt
of
that
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
limited
carbonation
but
ok
the
tartness
leaves
a
good
finish
that
really
helps
but
i
would
like
a
bit
more
complexity
the
supplication
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
a
nice
frothy
2
finger
head
with
great
retention
sits
atop
after
a
very
delicate
pour
the
aromas
were
noticed
immediately
after
popping
the
top
lots
of
cherries
make
up
the
sweetness
that
dominated
the
nose
some
grapes
are
also
noticed
most
likely
from
the
wine
barrels
that
are
used
during
the
aging
after
allowing
the
brew
to
warm
up
from
the
45
degree
fridge
shelf
the
first
quaff
was
taken
the
mouth
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
nose
with
a
very
balanced
sour
tartness
not
a
lip
smacker
like
some
sour
ales
can
be
again
lots
of
cherries
are
tasted
up
front
other
fruits
that
make
up
the
quaff
are
pinot
noir
grapes
and
plums
the
brett
also
come
through
with
the
quaff
which
is
expected
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
well
carbonated
much
like
a
champagne
this
is
by
far
the
best
sour
i
have
sampled
very
fortunate
to
have
tried
this
brew
and
can
only
imagine
how
it
tastes
with
a
year
or
two
on
the
shelf
thanks
again
jesse
for
allowing
me
to
try
it
d
if
not
for
price
and
rarity
i
could
drink
this
like
water
and
thats
only
a
slight
exaggeration
an
amazing
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
evolves
over
the
next
couple
years
d
this
brew
is
delicious
but
far
from
the
most
complex
sour
ive
had
its
a
kriek
alright
but
not
much
more
i
would
seek
out
again
but
wouldnt
go
too
far
to
get
it
drinkability
the
acidity
is
the
only
thing
that
holds
this
back
from
being
sessionable
good
stuff
drinkability
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
were
i
to
win
the
lottery
tomorrow
id
definitely
try
to
get
my
hands
on
a
few
cases
of
this
stuff
d
if
one
happens
to
get
ahold
of
this
brew
buy
it
dont
mind
the
cost
its
amazing
and
is
the
pinnacle
of
this
style
i
would
like
to
try
a
younger
example
just
to
see
how
it
compares
d
not
too
heavy
at
all
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
i
still
think
im
getting
acclimated
with
these
variety
of
ales
i
respect
this
beer
but
dont
think
i
can
truly
appreciate
it
yet
ill
be
rereviewing
this
in
a
year
or
so
to
see
how
my
palate
has
changed
drinkability
sadly
i
only
got
about
4oz
of
this
i
wouldve
gladly
taken
more
thank
you
so
much
mr
appler
this
is
the
best
sour
ive
had
to
date
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
drinkable
beers
that
ive
ever
had
i
made
very
short
work
of
my
375
ml
bottle
and
im
sad
that
i
only
bought
one
drinkability
just
one
glass
for
me
but
this
beer
could
possibly
appeal
to
people
who
think
they
dont
like
beer
or
any
alcohol
sour
candy
freaks
nice
job
russian
river
drinkability
its
very
smooth
considering
the
sourness
the
acidity
and
carbonation
help
balance
it
out
and
make
it
a
smooth
drink
amid
the
sour
fruit
flavors
d
easy
to
drink
but
the
sourness
does
slow
down
the
drinking
of
the
beer
but
i
want
to
enjoy
this
as
it
is
d
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
style
good
carbonation
levels
beautiful
fruit
and
a
beautifullybalanced
sourness
d
really
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
undeniably
refreshing
reminds
me
of
sour
skittlesthough
not
as
sweet
they
would
leave
me
always
wanting
more
best
wild
ale
i
have
had
worth
the
cost
great
drinkability
i
would
love
to
sip
on
one
of
these
all
day
long
d
insane
id
drink
a
3l
of
it
if
i
could
really
glad
i
have
a
few
more
simply
fantastic
and
the
best
am
wild
ale
ive
ever
had
i
am
not
the
biggest
sour
beer
fan
out
there
and
this
is
my
favorite
out
there
by
far
very
drinkable
for
me
considering
the
style
could
definitely
be
excited
to
order
this
for
years
to
come
batch
04x4
on
tap
at
falling
rock
in
denver
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
and
it
did
not
dissapoint
little
head
gives
way
to
a
nice
ruby
color
smelling
of
hay
and
fruit
mouthfeel
is
amazing
acidity
is
there
and
cuts
into
it
but
you
really
get
a
nice
dose
of
the
cherry
the
cherry
element
reminds
me
of
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
but
the
sourness
creates
its
own
unique
world
what
a
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
this
all
day
and
all
night
thank
you
mr
cilurzo
thank
you
ps
this
is
my
first
sour
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
can
see
myself
really
enjoying
this
style
more
often
thanks
russian
river
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
very
delicious
which
helps
the
drinkability
out
a
lot
its
sour
tart
and
acidic
for
sure
but
its
so
good
and
complex
drinking
it
really
is
a
pleasure
plus
i
really
love
anything
with
cherries
involved
in
it
the
acidity
is
the
only
thing
that
would
probably
get
to
me
if
i
were
to
drink
too
much
of
this
batch
003
gold
with
pink
and
red
in
color
nicely
robust
head
with
equally
alluring
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
sour
acetic
sweet
with
a
mild
note
of
dark
fruit
tastes
nicely
sour
of
cherry
skin
pediococcus
and
well
rounded
body
is
moderate
in
heft
with
a
smooth
plentiful
carbonation
tart
and
sweet
and
quite
easy
to
quaff
well
deserving
of
its
prestige
the
mouthfeel
makes
me
want
to
keep
sipping
it
is
addictive
in
its
uniqueness
would
be
great
with
thanksgiving
dinner
all
in
all
a
very
impressive
superior
crafted
creative
success
overall
i
would
drink
this
as
much
as
i
could
because
i
dont
see
it
often
but
i
am
lucky
to
see
it
here
and
there
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
levels
are
very
high
but
fairly
standard
for
the
style
drinkability
is
solid
thanks
to
the
funk
and
sourness
being
kept
in
check
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
sours
available
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
its
a
shame
its
seasonal
as
well
as
a
little
pricy
because
these
are
the
only
things
keeping
me
from
doing
so
d
this
is
the
most
perfect
sour
ive
had
to
date
awesome
draft
toronado
2007
vintage
this
beer
certainly
changed
over
the
course
of
23
years
theres
very
little
head
the
sourness
is
considerably
amped
up
it
almost
drowned
out
the
malt
complexity
for
me
those
sour
cherries
are
very
punchy
it
gets
almost
difficult
to
drink
by
the
end
but
its
a
delicious
torture
wonderful
beer
and
i
would
be
very
interested
to
see
further
changes
over
time
delicious
sour
ale
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
drinkability
cant
get
enough
drinkability
for
as
sour
as
it
is
i
am
rather
enjoying
this
375ml
bottle
i
really
wish
i
could
do
a
comparison
between
temptation
consecration
and
this
beer
the
only
three
sours
from
rr
ive
had
i
definitely
feel
this
is
better
than
consecration
in
my
honest
opinion
and
also
edges
out
temptation
still
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
them
all
together
this
one
has
a
massive
sour
punch
and
i
rather
enjoy
that
an
amazing
beer
and
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
couple
extra
so
i
can
age
them
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
because
it
is
so
unique
drinkibility
same
notes
as
the
above
moutfeel
exceptional
originality
in
this
brew
giving
it
the
high
scores
it
deserves
j
poured
a
hazy
brown
colo
with
red
hues
little
white
head
nose
is
sour
cherries
and
a
tartness
taark
cherries
and
a
deeper
tartness
than
consecration
pretty
sweet
booze
and
all
is
well
put
together
creating
a
good
brew
mouthfeel
has
a
wine
like
characteristic
very
good
sour
and
i
kept
going
back
to
this
so
good
extremely
drinkable
and
delicous
glad
i
have
a
growler
and
will
definetly
get
this
when
i
see
it
this
beer
brings
tears
to
my
eyes
highly
recommended
taste
starts
bracingly
sour
duh
more
vinagery
tartness
cherries
are
evident
in
the
middle
and
then
finishes
with
a
tannic
dryness
sour
yet
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
batch
is
even
better
than
the
last
md
this
beer
is
very
desirable
on
pretty
much
every
level
despite
looking
flat
supplication
on
tap
surprises
with
a
tingly
feeling
of
carbonation
that
envelops
the
palate
working
with
the
yeast
to
give
a
mouthpuckering
feeling
as
this
was
the
latest
batch
of
supplication
i
imagine
that
a
couple
more
months
of
aging
will
do
this
beer
a
lot
of
good
as
the
sour
notes
mature
and
amplify
however
the
flavor
and
the
balance
of
sweet
and
sourness
in
the
this
beer
is
impressive
to
say
the
least
d
just
as
drinkable
as
the
fresh
batch
that
will
be
released
on
friday
that
said
i
think
this
one
should
be
consumed
fairly
soon
unless
more
vinegar
is
your
thing
in
sours
notes
amazing
brew
my
favorite
between
rr
temptation
consecration
and
this
though
it
is
a
close
one
had
this
on
tap
at
the
blind
lady
ale
house
pours
out
with
a
nice
copper
color
which
im
guessing
comes
from
the
cherries
decent
amount
of
head
in
the
glass
smell
and
taste
were
almost
identical
for
me
tart
cherries
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
i
felt
this
beer
was
perfectly
carbonated
dry
like
a
champagne
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
the
bar
listed
it
at
9
abv
though
its
listed
differently
here
either
way
it
was
a
beer
where
the
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
so
beware
i
had
read
that
the
beer
is
barrel
aged
but
i
didnt
really
get
barrel
flavors
as
you
might
with
some
other
b
a
beers
another
home
run
from
russian
river
carbonation
is
probably
on
the
high
side
as
has
been
my
experience
with
most
of
vinnies
wilds
the
balance
of
the
various
flavors
keeps
drinkability
very
high
im
actually
enjoying
this
much
more
than
i
expected
too
bad
i
couldnt
convince
them
to
sell
me
a
growler
cant
wait
for
the
bottles
to
come
out
next
month
i
am
curious
to
see
how
my
remaining
bottles
will
continue
to
age
this
beer
can
be
aged
for
up
to
four
years
i
can
only
imagine
it
will
be
quite
sour
in
another
year
or
two
funky
tart
pickering
mouthfeel
that
isnt
acidic
in
the
least
bit
perfect
balance
of
brettu
funky
sourness
slight
malt
and
sweet
dark
fruit
notes
lots
of
spur
dark
cherrry
vinous
grape
raisin
and
plum
the
tart
curries
really
come
through
and
make
this
beer
amazing
well
balanced
and
quaffable
the
abv
is
nearly
undetectable
and
there
is
a
slightly
vinegary
pickering
aftertaste
that
leaves
me
salivating
for
another
gulp
i
love
this
damn
beer
and
am
so
excited
to
try
it
on
tap
this
further
cents
my
opinion
that
russian
river
is
the
best
brewery
on
the
planet
sek
tuis
beer
out
at
any
cost
especially
on
draft
a
grin
and
a
glance
at
our
comrades
weve
run
through
it
yet
again
were
warm
and
cheery
now
may
it
ever
be
thus
bottle
batch
002
a
bit
of
a
gusher
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
damp
oak
tart
cherries
grassy
brett
funk
some
candi
sugar
and
a
bit
of
port
flavor
is
strong
sour
cherry
with
a
delicate
creamy
sweetness
balancing
it
there
is
a
strong
oak
note
and
grassy
funk
from
the
brett
a
bit
vinous
too
medium
body
with
a
very
lively
carbonation
growing
vinous
with
age
the
pinot
character
is
really
dining
along
with
a
soft
mushroom
like
funk
the
chris
have
faded
but
the
vinous
notes
keep
the
memory
alive
kinda
like
a
bon
chien
but
lighter
awesome
this
and
consecration
batch
1
are
my
two
favorite
russian
river
sours
to
date
this
is
great
stuff
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
it
fresh
was
worth
the
payment
regardless
light
in
feel
and
briskly
carbonated
perfectly
balanced
and
ridiculously
complex
without
ever
being
a
challenge
i
had
another
few
things
i
desperately
wanted
to
try
not
knowing
when
and
if
ill
ever
be
back
in
santa
rosa
but
i
could
have
had
a
few
more
of
these
easy
just
dreamy
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
wild
ale
but
nothing
spectactular
i
prefer
the
rr
temptation
d
i
had
two
10oz
pours
of
this
and
strongly
considered
a
third
in
fact
as
im
typing
this
up
im
tempted
to
go
back
and
get
said
third
probably
my
favorite
russian
river
wild
ale
now
that
consecrations
recipe
has
changed
not
too
high
drinkability
as
i
find
this
rr
sour
in
particular
to
have
a
cumulative
puckering
affect
really
only
one
glass
is
suitable
but
that
one
glass
is
really
a
good
one
o
grapey
subdued
oak
lots
of
acid
but
balanced
well
one
of
the
best
rr
sours
overall
my
favorite
russian
river
beer
so
far
i
used
to
be
a
pliny
head
until
had
some
of
their
sours
more
simple
malt
than
consecration
less
sour
than
beatification
but
the
most
refined
drinkability
is
very
high
and
the
abv
is
very
wellhidden
went
back
for
this
two
more
times
despite
all
the
other
great
barrel
aged
beers
there
great
beer
vinnie
worth
the
long
wait
this
is
a
standout
beer
for
style
thanks
brad
overall
one
of
the
best
sours
out
there
imo
very
drinkable
and
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
i
will
probably
have
to
get
some
of
the
next
batch
when
it
comes
out
all
around
a
good
beer
i
really
enjoyed
that
it
wasnt
overly
dominated
by
vinegar
and
acidic
tastes
update
old
score
fresh
3
6
opened
one
recently
and
it
had
gotten
nice
and
sour
and
the
lemon
had
really
started
coming
out
the
funk
was
spot
on
not
dominating
but
making
itself
known
rescored
4209
i
may
like
this
beer
better
fresh
but
this
was
still
great
probably
not
really
drinkable
for
a
lot
of
people
considering
how
sour
and
dry
it
is
for
me
bring
it
by
the
pitcher
dthis
one
simply
works
for
me
like
a
light
dry
cherry
wine
another
american
wild
winner
from
the
genius
mind
of
vinnie
m
d
lightmedium
bodied
with
just
the
right
balance
of
carbonation
and
smoothness
to
enhance
the
flavors
the
sourness
dries
the
tongue
right
out
and
the
flavors
make
you
yearn
for
the
next
sip
a
winning
combination
but
im
not
looking
the
empty
glass
that
my
future
soon
holds
drinkability
very
smooth
with
great
flavor
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
perfect
for
the
style
it
is
well
carbonated
dry
and
crisp
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
multiple
bottles
of
and
something
i
would
like
to
drink
all
the
time
for
sure
drinkability
is
high
i
want
more
of
this
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
craving
this
all
night
bottle
batch
003
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
smells
musty
and
sour
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
taste
is
very
complex
and
has
many
flavors
including
oak
sour
fruit
tartness
pepper
spice
and
some
acidic
spiciness
overall
this
is
not
a
punch
you
in
the
mouth
sour
like
some
of
the
other
sours
out
there
its
more
subtle
its
more
drinkable
my
drinking
buddy
commented
its
like
eating
a
piece
and
candy
and
wanting
more
thats
what
its
like
between
sips
overall
a
great
brew
d
on
this
hot
summer
brewday
this
beer
really
does
myself
and
mrandypandy
well
so
complex
and
lively
this
beer
has
like
2000
different
tastes
going
on
it
feels
like
a
sour
pogostick
jumping
around
on
my
tongue
nice
job
guys
d
this
was
easily
the
best
sour
i
have
had
to
date
world
class
for
sure
i
really
appreciated
the
flavors
without
being
overwhelmed
by
them
despite
the
challenging
nature
of
this
sour
i
believe
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
couple
in
one
sitting
d
amazingly
balanced
and
smooth
for
a
sour
a
leader
in
its
class

hope
some

heavily

plenty
of

character
earthy
with
some

notes
sharp
acidic
taste
with
noticeable

are
much
stronger
here
than
in
the
nose
unapologetically
sour
and
dry
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
fantastic
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
imho
not
nearly
enough
for
the
top
50
certainly
worth
a
try
just
tried
batch
four
moved
mouthfeel
down
a
notch
as
it
is
overcarbonated
and
will
probably
get
even
more
so
d
a
really
enjoyable
awa
that
im
going
to
look
for
again
i
know
its
getting
hard
to
find
but
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
trade
for
another
down
the
road
rr
does
it
yet
again
d
super
amazing
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
by
far
lew
me
away
this
was
definitely
the
best
russian
river
sour
i
have
had
to
date
and
possibly
the
best
sour
overall
not
only
did
this
beer
contain
an
amazing
amount
of
intensity
and
complexity
but
it
displayed
a
level
of
balance
demonstrated
by
few
others
this
brew
is
destined
to
be
a
classic
this
served
for
a
great
start
to
the
day
thanks
again
dyan
overall
what
a
way
to
finish
off
a
wonderful
birthday
sorry
had
to
mention
it
once
more
anyways
this
beer
is
worth
getting
your
hands
on
even
if
you
dont
like
this
style
of
beer
more
flavor
than
you
would
expect
and
a
great
beer
overall
cheers
overall
this
was
an
incredible
beer
thanks
again
to
dyan
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
if
my
calculations
were
correct
this
should
be
the
beer
that
puts
the
first
drop
of
beer
in
my
mug
matching
it
up
with
review
300
would
have
awesome
but
that
just
means
i
have
another
excuse
to
open
up
something
awesome
again
soon
as
it
is
im
still
reeling
from
the
fact
that
this
bottle
will
no
longer
be
in
my
cellar
my
spreadsheet
says
i
bought
it
on
41807
over
2
years
ago
but
a
birthday
is
a
great
day
to
reward
all
that
patience
hv
d
this
is
another
great
sour
from
rr
not
as
good
as
their
other
sours
that
i
have
tried
imo
but
still
a
very
very
good
sour
this
one
has
a
bit
more
of
a
vinegar
presence
than
the
others
but
is
still
a
very
good
well
done
beer
i
am
looking
forward
to
consecration
and
their
other
beers
that
i
have
not
tried
yet
at
least
until
next
year
overall
supplication
was
my
first
sour
wow
this
is
incredible
i
cant
believe
what
ive
been
missing
crisp
and
so
light
in
body
beautifully
done
beer
d
the
12
7oz
is
definitely
enough
for
me
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
becomes
too
much
refreshing
and
drinkable
even
with
the
enhancements
from
the
age
overall
wonderful
sour
barrel
aged
beer
sournesscherries
and
funkiness
all
play
together
nicely
very
enjoyable
tap

tion

poured
hazy
bright
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
musty
dank
yeast
funk
combined
with
oaken
wine
barrel
earthiness
effervescent
mouthfeel
gives
it
a
light
feel
mouthpuckering
tartness
right
away
lemony
citric
bite
along
with
the
bretty
funk
a
vinuous
tanginess
follows
as
does
the
oak
and
cherry
flavors
definitely
a
success
in
terms
of
aging
in
that
it
tones
down
the
sometimes
harsh
vinegar
and
cheese
flavors
they
are
present
but
in
far
less
degree
so
the
quality
of
the
beer
itself
comes
through
the
pricetag
on
a
bottle
of
this
can
be
prohibitive
which
makes
having
this
on
tap
a
rare
treat
this
is
one
hell
of
a
drinkable
beer
but
you
will
definitely
be
sipping
supplication
to
savor
and
enjoy
it
a
fantastic
american
wild
ale
what
a
great
beer
i
will
have
this
beer
any
time
it
is
available
overall
why
do
i
have
to
live
so
far
from
russian
river
their
sours
are
amazing
and
this
is
no
exception
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
do
it
taste
is
all
kinds
of
crazy
to
spectacular
effect
tart
sour
cherry
oak
funk
must
a
dry
ending
quite
hard
to
describe
about
as
akin
to
normal
beer
as
american
football
to
intl
football
mouth
is
mostly
dry
medium
light
bodied
puckering
smooth
rather
easy
to
drink
for
its
oddity
its
not
my
first
brett
beer
but
its
probably
the
finest
much
thanks
to
tom
muenchenerkindl
for
this
one
d
super
high
i
shared
this
tiny
bottle
and
i
want
more
its
not
mouth
pucking
sour
but
quality
sour
thats
easy
drinking
hazy
light
amber
body
hosts
a
solid
beige
head
that
stands
at
an
inch
and
has
about
three
minutes
of
retention
before
staying
at
a
skim
nose
is
invigoratingly
tart
with
notes
of
sour
cherries
electric
funk
and
grape
skin
with
another
sniff
you
get
some
woodsy
alcohol
immediately
attacks
the
tongue
with
yeasty
barnyard
sour
funk
the
cherries
bring
about
a
nice
tongue
glazing
tartness
yeasty
and
almost
creamy
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
oak
really
comes
through
as
you
continue
to
drink
mouthfeel
has
backend
thickness
consistent
tart
funk
and
yeast
that
turns
to
a
veggie
like
hue
i
shared
this
with
my
wife
and
the
drinkability
makes
me
wish
the
bottle
was
twice
as
big
batch
3
poured
into
a
rr
barrel
glass
in
celebration
of
a
shitty
week
at
work
and
my
washing
machine
breaking
today
yee
ha
pours
a
orange
amber
colour
with
reasonable
clarity
frothy
one
finger
vanilla
coloured
head
with
good
lacing
nose
cherry
wood
musty
sour
and
just
damn
inviting
taste
sublime
lacto
sourness
citric
zing
and
green
apples
very
dry
earthy
and
woody
finish
this
brew
has
dried
out
quite
a
bit
since
the
last
time
ive
had
one
the
cherries
are
more
of
a
complementary
player
than
in
the
forefront
which
is
fine
by
me
drinkability
is
superb
and
the
spritzy
carbonation
dances
across
the
tongue
very
well
crafted
brew
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
am
joyous
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
if
i
am
in
rrs
neck
of
the
woods
i
would
probably
seek
out
another
bottle
but
at
a
17
price
tag
i
wont
be
stocking
up
its
worth
the
hunt
go
get
one
awesome
brew
with
consistant
notes
from
tap
and
from
375ml
bottle
lots
of
time
these
type
of
brews
have
weird
color
this
one
pulls
it
off
amazing
aroma
that
is
very
complex
funk
bright
and
muddled
red
fruits
acidity
sour
is
bam
which
should
evolve
well
in
bottle
less
than
beatification
and
more
than
temptation
for
my
palate
lots
of
upside
some
oak
tannin
nice
finish
long
and
the
sourness
carries
thru
and
brings
the
flavors
along
with
it
very
nice
and
distinct
a
slow
pout
produces
a
amber
brown
with
an
offwhite
fluffy
head
smells
of
apples
and
white
wine
light
musky
malts
smell
too
taste
is
intense
a
very
tart
flavor
makes
my
checks
tingle
tastes
like
it
smells
apples
and
white
wine
i
can
defiantly
taste
the
malts
too
the
oak
barrels
definitely
help
bring
all
the
flavors
together
plenty
of
balancing
hops
that
increases
the
viscosity
of
my
saliva
mouth
feel
is
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
if
you
let
it
wonder
you
can
feel
the
bubbles
form
all
over
your
tongue
and
mouth
drinkability
is
better
than
most
winebeers
i
think
the
aging
in
oak
barrels
have
contributed
to
the
drinkablilty
d
drinkability
is
good
the
big
tart
flavors
and
complexity
of
this
brew
make
it
a
candidate
for
a
sipper
the
cherries
add
something
different
and
unique
to
this
brew
and
pushes
the
drinkability
up
a
notch
as
it
warms
the
brett
flavors
start
to
smooth
out
and
some
brown
ale
qualities
start
to
come
through
this
is
another
winner
from
russian
river
highly
recommended
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
wild
ales
ive
ever
had
i
will
look
forward
to
hunting
this
sweet
bitch
down
again
d
i
had
no
problem
putting
this
bottle
down
and
would
have
another
if
it
wasnt
so
pricey
color
was
a
dull
gold
with
a
light
white
head
smells
of
tart
fruits
cherry
apple
sourness
a
very
drinkable
sour
less
biting
than
a
flanders
or
some
of
rrs
other
sours
medium
bodied
and
less
fruits
in
the
taste
than
i
expected
good
stuff
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
this
to
since
this
is
my
first
attempt
at
this
style
i
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
it
considering
this
was
totally
different
it
was
very
drinkable
and
especially
nice
with
my
cheese
and
crackers
i
would
have
liked
to
have
gotten
a
bit
more
sour
applecherry
flavors
i
cant
wait
to
try
temptation
next
very
nice
and
worth
the
hype
go
out
and
try
this
they
say
sour
is
the
new
ipa
well
if
this
is
the
head
of
the
sour
class
count
me
in
to
the
new
school
may
the
beer
gods
bring
russian
river
to
western
pa
d
a
sour
thirst
quencher
for
any
day
p
really
balanced
wild
alesour
what
have
you
would
like
to
have
more
of
these
to
say
i
enjoyed
savored
every
gulp
would
be
an
understatement
worthy
of
the
hype
kudos
this
brew
gets
small
creamy
faintly
pink
head
well
carbonated
cloudy
rosy
amber
color
smells
like
sour
cherry
pastry
earthy
yeasty
starts
very
sour
puckery
tart
sour
enough
to
take
your
breath
away
finshes
dry
some
white
wine
character
in
finish
and
aftertaste
still
very
sour
medium
body
i
want
to
like
this
more
but
sourness
overpowers

drinkability
on
a
sour
is
a
strange
question
yes
its
drinkable
but
how
much
sours
can
one
take
im
glad
i
decided
to
crack
this
one
open
tonight
i
have
been
really
missing
the
sours
and
it
was
easy
to
finish
this
bottle
of
myself
overall
a
worldclass
beer
that
deserves
to
be
so
highly
ranked
my
mission
in
life
is
to
find
more
of
this
beer
now
i
could
have
just
drank
this
all
night
but
this
ended
up
being
the
first
in
a
classic
night
of
beer
drinking
at
falling
rock
most
highly
recommend
get
one
now
wait
dont
get
one
as
that
would
leave
less
for
me
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orangey
amber
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
i
can
smell
the
sour
from
here
while
im
pouring
yum
upon
closer
inspection
many
layers
reveal
themselves
to
my
nostrils
theres
the
sour
funk
the
cherries
the
spicy
belgian
yeast
bready
malt
just
wonderful
smelling
really
taste
is
sour
lemons
limes
green
apples
some
cherries
a
bit
of
acid
any
trace
of
malt
or
yeast
gets
buried
in
the
sour
while
tasting
sour
fruits
galore
but
not
overpowering
incredibly
drinkable
very
dry
finish
crisp
carbonation
medium
body
creamy
dry
mouthfeel
wow
this
is
good
one
of
the
best
ive
had
although
a
little
more
cherry
wouldnt
hurt
pours
a
goldenhoney
color
minimal
beige
head
but
i
poured
slowly
as
per
the
bottles
instructions
a
few
spots
of
lacing
hanging
in
there
smells
of
white
wine
yeast
sour
cherry
taste
is
extremely
sour
intense
green
apples
and
cherries
maybe
some
pear
as
well
crazy
puckering
and
drying
mouthfeel
certainly
tasty
not
a
style
im
super
familiar
with
but
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
and
would
love
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
a
style
that
im
really
not
into
it
says
a
lot
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
despite
my
palate
not
quite
being
ready
for
sours
yet
get
some
now
overall
worth
a
try
but
to
me
not
among
the
very
best
of
sour
beers
drinks
pretty
easy
considering
the
tart
sour
going
on
here
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
2
bottles
of
this
but
certainly
the
best
of
this
style
in
a
bottle
ive
ever
had
i
must
for
sour
beer
freaks
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
light
overall
batch
3
this
beer
is
everything
i
was
hoping
for
i
love
it
this
is
exactly
the
way
i
wanted
to
celebrate
the
news
i
got
today
about
being
selected
for
advancement
to
e6
a
perfect
end
to
a
great
day
regardless
ive
been
supplicated
d
outstanding
this
goes
down
exceptionally
smooth
and
really
balances
the
sour
taste
very
well
d
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
even
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sour
beers
i
can
appreciate
the
fact
that
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
its
well
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
sour
style
color
is
clear
and
reddish
with
a
small
head
that
fades
quickly
some
earthy
scent
and
some
but
less
earthy
taste
bright
with
carbonation
maybe
even
a
little
too
much
the
rr
sour
taste
is
nice
and
cleaner
than
many
other
sours
burns
all
the
way
down
to
the
stomach
which
is
the
only
thing
that
decreases
drinkability
crisp
body
and
delicate
carbonation
fit
the
style
perfectly
like
i
said
another
artisinal
creation
from
vinnie
by
far
the
best
sour
i
have
tried
excellent
looking
forward
to
the
bottle
of
beatification
i
have
in
my
fridge
as
well
overall
not
everyday
but
makes
for
a
rare
treat
an
excellent
beer
like
this
the
most
of
the
rr
sours
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
trappist
yesterday
reddishorange
in
appearance
smells
like
sour
cherries
but
there
also
seemed
to
be
a
metallic
tinge
to
the
smell
that
was
offputting
taste
was
significant
sour
cherries
fresh
tart
a
little
bit
of
funk
fairly
well
balanced
the
sourness
is
under
control
overall
very
enjoyable
and
pretty
drinkable
d
not
too
shabby
not
really
one
of
my
styles
perhaps
but
a
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
im
still
not
completely
on
board
with
this
whole
wild
ale
thing
its
a
slow
and
steady
acclimation
process
as
with
any
new
style
that
being
said
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
in
my
opinion
it
was
absolutely
incredible
smelling
not
nearly
as
tart
as
some
wild
ales
ive
enjoyedbeen
subjected
to
and
overall
a
very
pleasant
experience
with
a
completely
manageable
abv
recommended
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
light
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
big
tart
cherries
with
some
oakiness
in
the
taste
sour
cherry
oak
hints
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
a
sour
bite
and
a
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
tart
cherry
and
white
grape
aftertaste
big
sour
big
cherry
fantastic
d
god
damn
it
why
cant
beers
like
this
be
on
the
shelves
of
the
store
that
being
said
this
is
a
treat
the
cherries
and
the
fact
that
it
was
a
brown
ale
blend
everything
nicely
a
good
starter
for
someone
wanting
to
try
a
wild
ale
i
find
that
russian
river
nails
that
tart
sourness
better
than
just
about
everyone
pours
a
light
brown
dark
gold
in
color
smell
is
tart
cherries
and
funk
there
are
also
some
wine
qualities
from
the
barrels
as
well
taste
is
more
of
the
tart
cherries
and
a
good
amount
of
the
brett
showing
as
well
tart
and
sour
on
the
mouthfeel
and
noncloying
a
real
joy
to
drink
everything
melds
itself
together
well
and
no
one
characteristic
dominates
very
good
sour
d
why
did
i
just
get
one
bottle
of
this
this
is
an
awesome
beer
that
i
want
to
have
again
and
again
this
is
one
beer
that
i
cant
find
any
faults
with
and
have
no
idea
how
you
would
even
improve
it
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
of
all
three
russian
river
wild
ales
ive
tried
so
far
this
is
the
one
that
i
can
say
is
certainly
worth
every
penny
supplication
noun
humble
prayer
entreaty
or
petition
mr
cilurzo
i
humbly
ask
that
you
do
whatever
is
in
your
power
to
return
to
the
days
when
those
of
us
who
reside
outside
of
california
were
able
to
have
russian
river
beer
delivered
to
our
homes
supplication
is
well
worth
its
lofty
ranking
on
the
top
beers
on
planet
earth
pours
a
bright
orange
with
minimal
white
head
smell
is
very
nice
lemons
ripe
pear
sour
green
apples
green
grapes
tropical
pine
apple
wow
so
many
smells
coming
and
going
taste
is
wow
begins
with
a
puckering
lemon
juice
hints
of
lime
white
wine
tropical
notes
of
pine
apple
and
a
wonderful
transition
to
a
green
apple
finish
mouthfeel
is
refreshingly
carbonated
i

pint
and
worth
every
penny
nice
brownredorange
color
in
the
wine
glass
smells
sour
dull
hmmm
bottle
was
better
it
tastes
nice
and
sour
with
some
cherry
and
it
does
pucker
a
lot
of
people
were
ordering
this
and
i
already
knew
why
an
awesome
sour
but
i
preferred
the
bottled
version
oddly
drinkability
is
great
the
interplay
and
balance
between
all
the
elements
here
is
superb
the
depth
and
complexity
keeps
you
going
back
for
more
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
so
i
could
just
keep
drinking
it
finally
time
to
supplicate
pours
a
nice
clear
brownish
red
with
a
white
fizzy
head
nose
is
balls
out
sour
funk
with
some
oak
and
very
slight
maltiness
taste
follows
with
typical
wild
rr
flavor
lovin
the
brown
ale
base
here
as
it
adds
an
interesting
subtle
flavor
to
the
brew
some
light
fruit
flavor
in
here
but
mostly
a
brett
funk
face
melter
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
little
thicker
than
you
average
wild
drinkability
is
second
to
few
or
none
as
are
all
the
rr
sours
i
have
yet
tried
thanks
again
mac
to
the
murch
supplication
is
another
wonderful
creation
from
russian
river
the
levels
of
tartness
along
with
the
semisweet
qualities
make
this
a
great
beer
very
thirst
quenching
with
a
little
of
that
puckering
ability
thanks
for
picking
these
up
for
me
derek
drinkability
is
very
nice
flavorful
and
acidic
without
being
overly
sour
or
sweet
no
vinegar
notes
either
its
really
close
to
my
taste
in
wild
ales
well
made
and
gets
bonus
points
for
rarity
especially
on
draught
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
has
a
lot
going
on
throughout
the
beer
and
my
mouth
is
pretty
puckered
after
this
one
thanks
to
bbothen
for
the
chance
to
try
this
d
rarity
and
scarceness
should
not
stop
you
from
obtainingrelishingsavoringenjoying
this
offering
from
rr
amazing
i
will
jump
at
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
beer
again
this
is
a
world
class
brew
in
my
book
and
thanks
go
out
again
to
dana
for
sending
this
my
way
i
like
it
very
much
but
thinking
about
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
is
not
appealing
that
being
said
im
sure
the
brewer
didnt
intend
this
beer
to
be
sessioned
something
to
savour
for
sure
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sourness
this
will
test
just
how
much
of
a
fan
you
are
the
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
and
is
carried
along
the
whole
way
by
a
wonderful
blend
of
carbonation
and
tartness
body
is
medium
i
wish
that
this
bottle
was
twice
the
size
that
it
was
but
ill
relish
the
fact
that
ive
got
a
few
more
waiting
just
a
highly
drinkable
and
highly
enjoyable
brew
big
thankyou
goes
to
jw347
for
sending
this
bottle
my
way
this
will
be
my
first
time
drinking
a
beer
from
russian
river
brewing
company
poured
in
to
a
wide
mouthed
wine
glass
a
strawberry
color
with
a
very
nice
sizable
white
head
show
aroma
is
wonderfully
funky
with
those
micro
bacteria
showing
themselves
early
on
lemon
juice
sour
cherry
vinegar
and
a
slight
dry
champaign
character
are
in
there
too
taste
hits
the
palate
with
a
wave
of
sour
funk
tart
fruit
and
a
lovely
almost
spicy
feel
carbonation
is
just
right
giving
it
even
more
of
a
champaign
feel
this
is
one
to
let
warm
up
a
bit
as
well
as
many
more
complexities
push
themselves
forward
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
this
style
as
the
carbonation
helps
things
out
for
me
this
resembles
a
cantillon
beer
which
is
very
impressive
because
their
beers
are
so
complex
i
would
say
that
if
anyone
wants
to
get
an
idea
of
what
this
beer
tastes
like
to
grab
some
cantillon
assuming
that
it
is
available
in
your
area
this
is
an
exceptional
wild
ale
i
cannot
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
offerings
from
russian
river
cheers
overall
boy
was
this
1
tart
quite
unique
and
enjoyable
is
you
like
sour
tartness
a
little
like
a
sour
patch
kid
candy
im
all
for
pushing
the
bounds
of
yeast
i
dont
feel
i
need
another
but
already
im
wondering
about
the
avery
fifteen
in
the
cellar
the
riserva
thats
headed
my
way
via
fedex
i
need
to
try
more
of
this
wild
ale
thing
do
what
you
can
to
try
some
russian
river
sours
supplication
is
the
epitome
of
what
an
american
wild
alesour
beer
should
be
this
is
an
amazing
sour
beer
its
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
calls
themselves
a
beer
nerd
or
beer
geek
this
really
is
a
beer
that
is
on
the
extreme
side
prosit

this
poured
an
orangish
copper
in
color
with
tinges
of
red
and
brown
it
had
a
fluffy
head
of
beige
bubbles
with
faded
to
leave
some
island
lacing
from
the
constant
bubbles
the
nose
showed
off
the
sour
cherries
along
with
other
red
fruits
brown
wood
and
an
herbal
funkiness
in
the
mouth
this
is
extremely
sour
and
acidic
with
the
tart
cherries
being
the
domminate
flavor
and
a
tannic
grip
on
the
finish
while
acidic
the
midpalate
does
come
off
as
balanced
with
a
nice
combination
of
carbonation
and
supple
edges
d
interesting
beer
sour
beers
are
slowly
growing
on
me
this
is
the
most
palatable
rr
ive
had
pairing
this
with
a
nice
rare
cut
of
red
meat
will
bring
out
some
additional
characters
in
the
beer
enjoy
this
one
for
awhile
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
hang
on
thanks
again
to
grant
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
supplications
another
fine
beer
from
russian
river
i
characterized
beatification
as
art
in
a
bottle
and
this
is
no
different
these
really
are
special
beers
russian
rivers
the
most
artistic
brewery
ive
encountered
their
beers
are
really
unlike
anything
else
ive
tried
truly
special
and
unique
hopefully
theyll
distribute
on
a
more
widespread
basis
someday
d
the
wood
vanilla
and
funk
are
incredible
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
from
a
snifter
again
this
is
a
great
rare
beer
that
could
be
drank
every
day
but
is
best
shared
with
friends
to
make
great
moments
long
sour
finish
very
tasty
brew
and
one
i
wish
i
could
have
more
often
very
drinkable
but
to
rare
to
drink
often
another
smashing
hit
from
russian
river
the
first
sip
is
very
tart
with
a
slight
cherry
finish
to
it
it
definitely
has
some
solid
bite
to
it
the
more
it
warms
up
the
more
the
winelike
qualities
of
the
beer
come
through
and
the
tartness
mellows
somewhat
some
light
phenols
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
are
there
as
well
the
carbonation
is
rich
and
gives
it
an
excellent
mouthfeel
overall
excellent
beer
as
for
drinkability
the
only
reason
it
does
not
get
a
5
is
that
it
is
so
hard
to
come
by
i
could
drink
this
all
day
although
it
would
have
to
be
sipped
there
is
no
hint
of
alcohol
in
this
one
completely
masked
by
the
tartness
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
i
wanted
to
age
but
not
sure
how
long
i
will
be
able
to
hold
on
to
them
now
that
i
popped
the
first
one
open
overall
great
brewer
great
beer
if
you
have
not
tried
it
do
all
you
can
to
get
it
wonderful
drinkability
not
quite
what
i
expected
i
expected
it
to
be
much
sweeter
and
more
balanced
than
just
a
huge
sour
tartness
a
cool
beer
for
the
style
but
i
dont
get
all
the
hype
i
could
throw
one
back
every
once
in
a
while
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
as
an
elite
beer
too
tart
to
the
extreme
for
my
taste
d
im
definitely
not
a
fan
of
this
style
however
for
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
accomplish
it
does
it
perfectly
in
the
right
arena
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
i
would
probably
enjoy
this
more
if
it
were
paired
with
foods
but
im
just
drinking
it
straight
up
at
the
moment
if
your
into
trying
new
different
styles
this
is
a
must
its
the
best
wild
ale
youll
get
drinkabilityi
s
fairly
high
alcohol
is
moderate
and
flavors
are
great
but
tart
beers
are
always
limited
in
their
consumption
taste
starts
off
rather
tart
and
acidic
lime
and
cherry
tartness
make
up
the
most
of
it
relentless
sourness
is
backed
up
by
slightly
sweet
cherries
red
wine
and
oak
delicious
finish
remains
tart
and
acidic
with
residual
cherries
leather
vinous
grapes
and
oak
very
well
done
medium
body
with
a
very
dry
finish
spritzy
sparkling
carbonation
would
love
to
get
more
bottles
of
this
thanks
to
cloudskipper
for
the
hookup
this
is
not
a
beer
that
is
not
easy
for
most
of
us
to
get
our
hands
on
however
if
youve
not
had
it
you
should
travel
trade
or
attend
a
festival
to
get
it
d
delicious
i
could
suck
this
down
all
day
the
funky
taste
may
get
to
you
after
a
while
but
definitely
not
from
this
bottle
on
the
nose
with
cherries
literally
fragrant
cherry
aroma
hit
me
immediately
reminds
me
of
cherry
sweet
tarts
or
smarties
looks
great
in
my
duvel
glass
perfect
lacing
and
nice
head
taste
is
more
tart
than
sour
with
slight
notes
of
cherry
chloraseptic
but
not
in
a
bad
way
must
be
the
brett
as
it
warms
noticeable
oak
well
balanced
drinkable
as
much
as
any
12

ounce

if
you
can
get
it
at
that
price
beer
can
be
kind
of
bummer
that
it
is
not
more
affordable
and
available
would
love
for
it
to
have
a
chance
to
grow
on
me
more
and
perhaps
share
a
little
with
the
wife
very
unique
d
now
while
i
love
this
unique
rr
offering
it
has
to
be
in
the
right
setting
this
needs
to
be
paired
with
food
or
enjoyed
as
you
would
a
liquor
i
would
love
to
have
multiple
of
these
on
hand
to
drink
on
a
whim
d
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
probably
russian
rivers
most
balanced
beer
if
you
can
find
it
buy
it
and
drink
it
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
i
could
easily
enjoy
daily
and
probably
not
get
sick
of
it
the
sourness
isnt
over
the
top
but
its
prevalent
enough
to
satisfy
that
sour
tooth
that
ive
acquired
as
of
late
terrifically
balanced
and
funky
i
think
this
is
a
absolutely
brilliant
brew
that
must
be
tried

i
thought
this
was
wonderful
and
well
worth
the
price
and
the
hassle
to
get
it
these
rr
sours
are
unlike
anything
else
made
it
was
truly
unreal
to
see
these
develop
and
i
am
glad
i
have
a
few
to
lay
down
for
a
while
you
really
need
to
go
out
and
get
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
it
is
definitely
worth
it
o
best
sour
beer
ive
had
to
date
not
that
ive
had
a
ton
very
drinkable
once
you
get
over
the
initial
shock
i
dont
know
if
this
will
ever
be
a
style
that
i
just
love
but
this
was
surely
worth
the
money
if
this
were
more
readily
available
it
would
be
something
id
try
to
keep
on
hand
for
when
the
mood
struck
me
thanks
to
weibull
drseamus
who
traded
me
one
of
these
last
year
d
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
brew
huge
flavor
and
a
great
drinking
experience
well
done
drinkability
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
very
good
wish
i
had
more
of
it
d
this
is
another
winner
from
rr
well
balanced
delicious
what
more
is
there
to
say
maybe
not
my
favorite
of
the
sours
but
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
or
two
i
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
stuff
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
i
could
have
a
few
before
needing
something
sweet
or
some
food
i
enjoyed
this
sour
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
very
tasty
an
excellent
change
up
from
the
hop
trip
ive
been
on
as
a
warning
stay
away
if
you
dont
like
tart
flavors
pours
a
rosey
amber
color
with
no
head
more
pleasant
nose
than
most
any
of
the
other
sours
i
sampled
on
the
same
evening
nose
of
sourness
like
funk
and
some
dark
fruitines
taste
is
very
tart
mild
sweetness
and
some
fruitiness
very
oaky
flavor
and
some
dry
sour
cherries
as
well
quite
tart
indeed
yet
still
pretty
drinkable
i
can
see
this
being
really
good
if
sours
were
my
thing
md
sour
and
hard
to
drink
because
of
the
lock
jaw
that
ensued
i
appreciate
what
the
brewer
was
trying
to
do
and
that
was
create
an
amazingly
sour
beer
for
those
who
love
sour
like
my
wife
but
this
intensity
was
a
little
to
much
for
me
i
will
be
having
it
again
since
my
wife
loves
this
one
nice
and
refreshing
great
example
of
rr
wild
ale
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
really
like
this
beer
if
i
was
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
didnt
like
cherry
flavor
only
a
few
months
ago
i
have
really
begun
to
enjoy
cherry
flavor
in
beer
this
is
an
incredible
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
case
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
pink
hues
with
fizzy
beige
head
little
retention
and
spotty
lacing
smells
of
sour
cherry
citrus
zest
caramel
bread
yeast
and
red
wine
taste
is
very
tart
with
lots
of
sour
cherry
presence
beyond
that
there
is
a
taste
of
grapes
caramel
oak
brown
sugar
and
a
musty
funk
mediumlight
in
body
with
good
carbonation
and
lots
of
tartness
and
an
acidic
balance
with
a
good
amount
of
tart
and
sour
flavors
it
isnt
a
beer
for
everyone
but
it
is
certainly
different
and
at
least
worth
a
try
a
very
unique
brew
that
i
wish
i
had
more
bottles
of
certainly
not
sessionable
but
nice
for
a
change
every
so
often
especially
for
dessert
pours
a
tan
amber
red
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
a
mix
of
sour
fruit
with
musty
funk
taste
is
more
of
the
same
the
beer
has
a
good
malt
sweetness
that
comes
through
a
little
but
the
taste
is
overall
dominated
by
the
tartness
a
good
beer
but
not
for
all
occassions
this
was
the
first
tart
beer
which
i
really
appreciated
it
had
a
tart
cheery
flavor
in
the
mouth
a
very
good
beer
deep
burnt
reddish
orange
with
a
light
haze
and
shortlived
foam
the
colour
was
really
gorgeous
the
aroma
was
very
earthy
and
woody
juicy
cherry
delicate
red
grapes
a
bit
vinous
fruity
with
tart
berry
mouthwatering
tartness
in
the
flavour
with
a
very
light
acidic
character
sour
cherry
and
vinous
raspberry
woody
and
oaky
perhaps
a
hint
of
funk
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
bit
of
residual
sugar
present
still
some
dryness
though
mild
warmth
in
the
finish
this
stuff
is
super
tasty
highly
drinkable
and
a
great
accompaniment
to
dinner
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
but
id
love
to
have
more
the
taste
is
fairly
dry
much
drier
than
the
pasteurized
flemish
beers
but
still
strikes
a
malty
balance
with
a
bit
of
caramel
complexity
to
it
the
finish
is
pleasingly
acidic
with
a
leaning
towards
the
acetic
side
of
things
this
beer
is
really
well
done
i
am
quite
impressed
this
is
quite
a
bit
farther
along
than
the
temptation
the
finish
has
notes
of
a
tannic
woodiness
plus
a
long
sour
note
that
lingers
along
with
the
woodiness
this
beer
certainly
reminds
me
of
cherries
with
a
nice
fruitiness
to
it
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
become
enamored
of
this
beer
an
authentic
flemish
style
sour
beer
that
has
not
been
pasteurized
this
is
quite
a
bit
better
and
much
more
balanced
than
new
belgiums
la
folie
there
is
a
wonderful
interplay
between
the
oak
maltiness
and
acid
character
this
is
superb
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
vintages
of
this
pours
a
clouded
reddish
amber
nose
is
a
beautiful
antiseptic
funk
flavor
is
outstanding
crisp
woody
character
with
wild
barrel
aged
goodness
outstanding
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
great
level
of
carbonation
for
fks
sake
is
this
drinkable
obviously
a
work
of
art
d
could
drink
this
consistently
if
it
werent
made
in
ca
and
not
the
easiest
to
get
around
me
this
may
not
be
the
best
sour
beer
that
i
have
had
but
certainly
highly
drinkable
an
a
great
offering
from
rr
d
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
i
had
had
it
once
before
when
it
was
first
released
in
stores
here
in
socal
a
few
months
ago
and
really
liked
it
but
this
time
wow
its
so
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
drank
it
in
like
20
minutes
but
i
milked
it
for
a
couple
of
hours
while
watching
the
santa
clause
because
its
so
damn
good
an
extraordinary
beer
couldnt
recommend
it
more
go
buy
it
its
worth
the
price
even
if
it
is
about
a
dollar
an
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
union
jacks
in
glenside
pa
poured
ruby
read
with
a
touch
of
brown
small
quickly
disappating
head
thin
lacing
slightly
cloudy
smells
of
cherries
pungently
some
alcohol
on
the
nose
too
taste
is
of
tart
cherries
with
an
earthy
sweetness
below
sour
puckeringly
delicious
malt
as
it
warms
the
cherries
soften
or
at
least
become
less
tart
and
some
oak
and
more
sour
malt
come
through
wonderfully
the
finish
has
some
hints
of
vanilla
which
add
more
depth
to
the
overall
flavor
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
sticky
a
nicedrinking
wild
ale
that
demands
to
be
savored
so
many
subtle
flavors
and
odors
make
every
sip
a
treat
a
wonderous
beer
creation
pours
a
hazy
burned
orangecaramel
with
a
white
head
that
dies
completely
smells
of
huge
sourness
a
little
cherry
and
oak
as
an
afterthought
taste
starts
out
mild
then
bam
huge
rush
of
tarty
goodness
you
want
to
pucker
its
so
sour
finally
mellows
out
with
the
oak
and
cherry
peaking
through
medium
in
the
mouth
and
a
tickle
of
either
carbonation
or
the
tartness
giving
its
finishing
move
you
want
to
sip
this
because
larger
samplings
at
a
time
would
be
a
waste
a
very
tasty
and
different
libation
excessively
drinkable
complex
enough
to
handle
a
variety
of
duties
in
food
pairing
you
simply
must
try
this
beer
and
russian
river
simply
must
find
a
way
to
produce
more
of
it
the
beer
finally
pours
a
cloudy
ochre
color
with
minimal
beige
head
aroma
is
funky
musty
and
some
oak
and
tart
cherry
as
well
first
sip
reveals
a
light
body
with
almost
no
carbonation
the
texture
is
a
little
thin
to
watery
flavor
is
as
expected
with
caramel
and
tart
cherry
some
wooden
notes
and
a
fairly
dry
earthy
and
vinous
finish
not
a
bad
beer
after
the
initial
gusher
but
not
my
favorite
sour
brew
either
starts
with
a
gentle
cidery
sweetness
then
progresses
to
a
tartly
abrasive
and
sharply
carbonated
finish
leaves
flavors
of
woody
cherries
sour
citrus
tart
grape
skins
and
a
slight
acidity
a
nicely
complex
tartly
refreshing
very
drinkable
beer
sorry
for
not
having
better
notes
i
want
to
be
sure
to
remember
to
have
this
beer
again
when
i
go
to
california

thank
you
to

for
this
gem
served
at
cellar
temperature
in
an
ommegang
chalice
poured
a
beautiful
reddish
orange
with
brownish
highlights
that
was
quite
hazy
about
a
finger
of
loose
bubbly
tan
head
sat
atop
the
brew
had
faded
pretty
quickly
and
left
little

smell
is
of
sour
cherries
red
wine
and
some
pretty
wild
yeastbacteria
aromas
had
a
nice
yeasty
sour
cherry
red
wine
flavor
that
was
quite
tart
also
wood
and
bacteria
like
flavors
a
nice
crisp
but
very
sour
finish
nice
medium
bodied
acidic
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
and
very
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
beer
style
but
this
one
might
change
my
mind
temptation
is
looking
like
my
favorite
of
the
three
barrel
aged
russian
river
offerings
but
this
is
another
great
brew
pours
a
very
unique
thick
murky
amberbrownish
hue
with
a
thin
one
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
that
seems
to
die
down
to
a
thin
layer
that
stays
for
a
good
while
stickiness
isnt
there
at
all
smell
is
sour
cherries
nuts
red
wine
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
is
souracidic
but
enjoyable
cherries
sounds
pathetic
but
reminds
me
of
a
sour
patch
kid
sweet
and
sour
go
back
and
forth
fight
each
other
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
end
the
sour
seems
to
win
the
battle
do
i
need
to
mention
the
bretts
well
i
did
even
though
with
any
rr
wild
ale
its
already
a
given
beginning
sour
middle
red
wine
end
green
apple
such
a
complex
brew
im
sure
i
missed
a
crapload
of
flavors
but
these
are
the
ones
that
stuck
out
to
me
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
whole
lotta
carbonation
crisp
and
bitter
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
good
i
took
my
time
with
it
not
because
it
was
difficult
to
put
down
but
just
because
i
wanted
to
get
every
flavor
out
of
it
i
could
i
look
forward
to
the
bottle
of
sanctification
i
brought
back
from
the
brewery
this
summer
russian
river
raises
the
bar
with
supplication
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
temptation
further
proves
why
russian
river
brewing
company
is
the
best
of
the
best
drinkability
this
is
hard
to
find
in
the
richmond
area
and
a
few
years
ago
i
got
i
think
the
last
two
bottle
that
once
upon
a
vine
had
i
still
have
another
one
that
im
planning
to
save
for
something
special
but
this
one
was
opened
because
its
been
way
too
long
without
trying
it
certainly
there
are
many
characteristics
related
to
a
saison
more
so
than
temptation
even
i
think
but
its
truly
an
experience
and
i
really
hope
more
folks
start
to
experiment
with
the
style
in
the
future
worth
the
9
in
my
opinion
but
obviously
not
something
you
could
probably
get
often
especially
since
the
bottles
slightly
over
12
ounces
but
still
bravo
this
is
amazing
stuff
and
i
hope
the
distribution
increases
throughout
the
us
as
the
years
go
on
crisp
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
coupled
with
the
refreshing
sourness
make
this
beer
highly
drinkable
probably
my
favorite
rr
sour
ale
maybe
even
my
favorite
sour
ale
if
you
can
find
this
consider
yourself
lucky
and
do
the
right
thing
and
buy
it
i
spent
18
dollars
on
the
375
ml
bottle
and
feel
that
it
was
well
worth
it
highly
recommended
delicate
body
carbonation
like
champagne
very
smooth
and
bubbly
clearly
a
beer
to
sip
but
its
very
rewarding
as
it
evolves
with
warmth
delicious
depthful
and
drinkable
by
the
case
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
at
capones
poured
into
an
appropriate
russian
river
barrel
aged
glass
poured
a
dark
redlight
brown
murky
color
the
smell
was
very
yeasty
which
was
expected
because
of
the
appearance
the
taste
was
great
sour
and
yeasty
with
a
little
carbonation
this
was
a
nice
wild
ale
and
was
enjoyed
over
an
hour
to
experience
different
temps
another
good
barrel
aged
product
from
russian

is
good
here
except
for
not
being
able
to
acquire
more
than
one

sweet
and
then
tart
not
noticing
the

as
much
as
in
batch

seems
a
bit
more
lambicleaning
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
very
nice
tartness
quenches
the
thirst
as
a
bonus
not
quite
as
impressive
for
me
as
its
predecessor
enjoyed
this
very
much
had
a
nice
rich
taste
within
a
relatively
light
alcohol
body
acidity
is
its
limiting
quality
as
it
somewhat
burns
on
its
way
down
otherwise
the
sour
and
fruit
work
very
nicely
together
d
its
definitely
a
sipper
would
pair
very
will
with
food
not
something
ill
be
having
very
often
but
highly
recommended
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
wonderful
range
of
beer
and
the
incredible
things
that
are
being
done
by
american
craft
brewers

a

i

a
little
more

batch

has
been

in
my
cellar
for
two
years
and
has
truly
benefited
from

an
extraordinary
accomplishment

a
bit

if
you
have
patience
wait
a

of

drinkability
normally
such
an

would
keep
the

this

so
good

i
honestly
dont

it

id

i
traded
a
growler
of
imperial
porter
from
portsmouth
brewery
for
this
beer
chris
at
ebenezers
pub
wanted
me
to
try
supplication
by
the
way
if
youre
ever
in
central
western
maine
ebenezers
in
lovell
is
a
destination
this
was
a
375ml
champagne
bottle
batch
002
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
nice
red
color
with
very
little
head
it
had
a
cherry
aroma
the
taste
was
primarily
sour
cherry
very
tart
and
almost
astringent
it
was
vaguely
vinous
a
little
bit
of
yeast
showed
up
late
very
good
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
to
me
is
limited
by
the
tartness
truly
a
remarkable
achievement
pours
a
hazy
reddish
orange
with
some
sdiment
and
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
the
smell
is
wonderful
sour
cherries
and
a
bit
of
funkiness
the
taste
is
even
better
with
an
acetic
quality
to
start
followed
by
a
long
slightly
bitter
finish
there
is
some
funkinessbut
its
restrained
there
is
also
a
noticeable
hit
of
cherries
at
the
end
im
putting
one
of
these
bottles
down
for
a
yewar
to
see
what
happens
very
crisp
mouthfeel
eminently
refreshing
and
drinkable
d
i
think
it
is
very
nice
i
would
probably
buy
another
bottle
of
this
but
it
isnt
1
on
my
list
i
think
the
beatification
is
a
lot
nicer
absolutely
fantastic
blows
away
any
other
sour
beer
ive
had

the

this
is
another

from
rr
highly
recommended
i
had
the
pleasure
of
having
this
beer
completely
by
chance
as
they
arent
avalible
in
ct
wow
what
a
beer
im
a
fan
of
the
jolly
pumpkins
and
this
was
a
natural
for
me
great
tart
friuty
aroma
that
was
present
in
the
taste
also
on
top
of
this
there
was
slight
oak
and
malt
flavors
amoungst
a
bunch
of
others
that
i
couldnt
even
idenify
but
did
taste
them
there
the
mouthfeel
was
standard
for
a
beer
of
this
type
and
the
tartness
was
not
over
powering
by
any
standards
i
wish
i
could
taste
there
whole
line
of
wild
ales
but
my
home
state
has
affectively
shut
me
out
of
this
oppertunity
damn
shame
brewing
is
an
art
overall
impression
as
with
most
russian
river
beers
im
impressed
huge
depth
of
flavor
although
it
cost
me
a
fair
amount
to
get
it
to
colorado
it
was
more
than
worth
it
why
arent
more
american
brewers
experimenting
with
the
wild
styles
this
beer
is
a
masterpiece
an
amazing
ale
purchased
at
stone
brewery
bistro
man
oh
man
this
was
my
first
american
wild
ale
and
it
was
a
real
beauty
after
my
first
drink
i
already
knew
it
was
at
least
in
top
10
favorite
beers
i
would
even
venture
to
say
that
it
is
my
absolute
favorite
right
up
there
with
de
rankes
kriek
it
smelled
somewhat
like
a
lambic
and
it
had
a
similar
sourness
to
it
though
i
could
certainly
taste
the
aging
in
the
pinot
noir
wine
barrels
though
the
alcohol
was
only
slightly
present
in
the
taste
it
more
so
affected
the
mouthfeel
adding
a
little
warmth
to
it
overall
it
was
a
very
distinct
experience
from
tasting
a
lambic
and
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
cant
wait
to
crack
open
the
one
i
have
waiting
at
home
in
california
as
well
as
the
rr
temptation
in
there
as
well
this
indeed
is
the
future
of
beer
great
wild
ale
from
rr
nobody
does
this
style
better
very
complex
and
interesting
taste
definitely
worth
seeking
a
bottle
of
this
out
d
highly
drinkable
9
but
one
of
the
least
noticeable
9
brews
ive
ever
had
this
is
my
first
russian
river
experience
but
so
far
they
are
some
freaking
ballers
omg
i
need
traders
this
beer
is
batch
002
and
consumed
on
31507
when
i
popped
the
cork
the
beer
rocketed
out
the
beer
is
dark
amber
in
color
with
little
yeasties
floating
in
suspension
floating
yeast
is
to
be
expected
from
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
the
head
fell
quickly
although
i
did
leave
the
bottle
for
a
bit
after
it
ran
over
the
aroma
has
a
strong
brett
presence
with
a
cidery
aroma
in
there
as
well
the
tart
cherry
taste
brett
and
carbonation
make
the
glands
in
my
neck
tingle
the
brett
is
very
pronounced
and
seems
to
make
the
body
seem
lighter
and
thinner
overall
the
only
disappointment
is
the
lack
of
body
highly
recommended
truly
masterfully
crafted
this
is
a
beer
you
give
to
someone
who
says
all
beer
tastes
the
same
one
taste
and
theyll
beg
forgiveness
for
spouting
off
such
crazy
fallacies
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrown
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
offwhite
head
smell
is
very
tart
there
are
aromas
of
cherries
but
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
to
them
predominant
smells
of
sour
and
funk
this
is
not
as
sour
as
some
other
beers
of
this
style
but
thats
not
the
goal
the
goal
is
to
create
a
damn
good
brew
and
i
would
say
mission
accomplished
there
are
sour
cherries
in
the
taste
as
well
but
its
more
of
a
vinegarlike
sourness
mixed
with
some
oak
and
some
grapes
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
had
medium
levels
of
carbonation
finish
was
dry
extremely
drinkable
i
would
have
plenty
of
this
often
if
i
were
given
the
chance
drinkability
i
want
more
much
more
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
beers
im
going
to
order
a
ton
of
batch
003
when
they
finally
come
out
with
it
yum
bottle
exploded
all
over
an
we
lost
some
of
the
beer
wait
until
the
yeast
is
out
of
suspension
when
it
gets
to
your
house
by
mail
yeah
pours
a
slight
head
that
goes
away
right
away
the
color
is
brownish
gold
with
a
cloudyness
the
smell
is
very
belgian
with
brett
yeast
and
some
horse
blanket
but
the
age
has
made
it
so
its
not
too
offensive
the
taste
is
sour
with
an
lemonlike
aftertaste
mixed
with
the
horse
blanket
sourness
its
definetly
like
my
first
sour
beer
where
i
made
a
sour
face
this
is
mellowed
and
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
good
a
little
heavy
like
water
but
nothing
negative
to
say
about
it
overall
it
was
nice
to
try
i
would
have
this
again
sometime
d
i
am
beginning
to
really
love
the
combo
of
sour
beers
and
cherries
thanks
to
the
help
from
new
glarus
and
supplication
is
a
great
example
of
this
combo
a
fantastic
beer
wish
i
had
ordered
more
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
very
refreshing
just
a
real
pleasure
to
sit
and
sip
on
this
beer
and
try
to
pick
up
all
it
has
to
offer
i
look
forward
to
cracking
some
bottles
and
exploring
further
the
body
is
difficult
to
judge
when
my
whole
mouth
is
puckering
under
the
onslaught
of
tartness
but
i
would
judge
that
it
is
medium
and
fairly
dry
the
9
abv
is
very
well
hidden
crisp
carbonation
as
one
would
expect
quite
drinkable
for
a
strong
tart
beer
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
gueuze
boon
marriage
parfait
though
with
more
oakiness
this
is
easily
the
most
interesting
beer
i
have
ever
tried
highly
recommended
its
a
bit
too
funky
to
be
an
everyday
drinking
beer
this
is
so
different
i
just
think
i
like
temptation
just
a
little
bit
better
its
a
hazy
red
with
a
bit
of
foam
smells
of
oak
leather
paint
tastes
tangy
and
a
touch
bitter
with
cherry
and
pinot
flavors
for
the
barrels
drink
this
one
cool
as
the
fruit
flavors
come
out
more
the
funky
bacteria
flavors
tend
to
overtake
this
one
as
it
warms
a
heck
of
an
interesting
brew
though
id
take
this
over
rodenbach
any
day
cheers
to
rr
for
making
weird
stuff
like
this
this
beer
was
exceptional
i
could
drink
one
of
these
every
day
if
only
there
was
that
much
to
go
around
get
a
bottle
of
this
and
drink
it
now
medium
with
a
slight
prickly
feeling
i
could
drink
this
beer
daily
and
be
content
pours
a
hazy
deep
orange
amber
color
with
a
tall
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
creamy
lace
sour
cherries
dominate
the
nose
along
with
additional
notes
of
sweet
malt
leather
wet
wood
and
a
barnyard
horse
blanket
funk
quite
sniffable
actually
taste
is
sweet
lightly
toasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
delicately
balanced
by
a
tart
cherry
sourness
along
with
a
wild
yeastiness
and
an
earthy
woodiness
notes
of
oak
and
vanilla
are
detectable
in
the
background
this
was
a
real
treat
to
drinki
only
wish
i
had
more
than
the
one
bottle
d
this
is
ecstasy
in
a
bottle
go
get
some
sell
off
your
children
if
necessary
this
was
truly
a
perfect
pairing
with
a
thick
cut
pork
chop
with
a
sweet
and
sour
pan
sauce
sweet
vermouth
smoked
bacon
shallots
plum
tomato
butter
etc
some
roasted
yams
and
a
salad
just
amazing
lots
and
lots
of
samples
at
the
gabf
06
this
thing
wreeks
of
funk
and
tart
cherries
i
love
it
golden
straw
color
with
lively
carbonation
with
a
spritzy
white
head
the
cherries
come
through
very
nicely
oat
and
then
the
bugs
awesome
stuff
next
time
they
are
selling
the
barrel
stuff
online
im
pulling
the
trigger
drinkabilitynotes
a
difficult
beer
to
review
certainly
possesses
a
daunting
complexity
but
in
a
positive
sense
try
it
if
you
are
able
thanks
to
my
friend
and
fellow
ba
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
rare
example
d
gets
better
with
every
sip
that
being
said
i
feel
satisfied
after
drinking
the
one
bottle
good
thing
too
because
its
15bottle
polished
glimmering
bronzed
amber
short
cap
of
tanned
loosely
piled
bubbles
that
dissipates
to
a
skim
coat
initial
glasscovering
large
bubbled
carbonation
gives
way
to
a
narrow
pillar
of
fine
bubbles
vibrant
aromas
of
brett
cherry
pits
and
tart
skin
some
damp
wood
simultaneously
sweet
and
just
a
touch
sour
and
funky
the
taste
starts
with
a
nice
tart
sharpness
that
is
filled
with
a
dry
cherrylaced
sweetness
the
underlying
brown
ale
is
readily
discernable
and
serves
as
a
solid
base
some
damp
wood
becomes
evident
during
consumption
the
brett
character
is
long
in
the
finish
and
is
complimented
by
a
bit
of
sourness
in
the
tail
end
as
it
warms
the
sweetness
comes
up
a
touch
medium
body
with
barely
detectable
carbonation
the
light
sharpness
reduces
the
body
a
bit
there
is
a
light
slickness
that
glazes
the
tongue
it
was
hard
to
put
the
glass
down
as
the
supplication
was
absolutely
enjoyable
unfortunately
it
was
my
last
bottle
but
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
next
release
mouthfeel
is
great
excellent
carbonation
with
clean
biting
semidry
but
still
wet
yes
i
wanted
more
after
my
half
glass
was
gone
still
wanting
more
hazy
reddishbrown
color
with
about
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
head
musty
aroma
full
of
cherries
and
also
a
slight
tartness
almost
like
a
little
lemon
zest
has
been
added
nice
and
funky
flavor
with
a
great
sour
cherry
flavor
a
little
oaky
and
some
vanilla
also
a
little
bit
of
lactic
acid
flavor
velvety
mouthfeel
great
carbonation
it
seems
like
there
are
new
flavors
coming
out
with
every
sip
very
nice
offering
cork
pops
off
with
an
explosive
pop
the
beer
pours
aky
red
in
color
with
a
moderately
thin
offwhite
head
very
sour
aroma
big
cherry
flavor
with
a
nice
oaky
character
flavor
starts
very
sweet
gets
a
bit
rough
on
the
tongue
midpalate
like
licking
a
cork
oaky
woodiness
then
comes
through
fairly
strongly
blending
nicely
with
a
semisweet
cherry
flavor
at
the
finish
yeast
pour
mellows
the
flavor
a
bit
enhancing
the
fruity
character
nicely
another
great
one
from
russian
river
ive
got
nothing
but
praise
for
vinnie
truly
a
pioneer
lovely
bottleconditioned
mouthfeel
really
velvety
and
attractive
smellability
is
off
the
scale
but
drinkability
not
so
much
for
me
as
the
oak
is
a
bit
much
and
the
palate
just
isnt
that
interesting
some
additional
cellar
time
might
allow
the
sourness
to
build
and
break
through
the
palate
adding
balance
and
interest
well
see
regardless
an
inspiring
effort
and
one
hell
of
a
nose
batch
one
thanks
to
eric
for
hand
carrying
it
to
texas
for
me
initially
the
first
thought
upon
getting
a
whiff
of
this
brew
is
lambic
sour
musty
funky
cherry
aroma
but
theres
also
a
very
earthy
rotted
pumpkin
thing
going
on
here
innnteresting
flavors
meld
beautifully
upfront
tartness
yields
to
woody
birch
bark
flavors
followed
swiftly
as
this
is
all
too
quaffable
by
the
lingering
mildly
sour
cherry
vanilla
notes
carbonation
is
noticeable
on
the
palate
yet
somehow
has
a
creamy
lactic
milklike
feel
that
ive
never
tasted
usually
its
one
or
the
other
this
is
well
carbonated
and
strangely
creamy
what
the
can
there
be
a
creativity
rating
this
gets
5s
there
extremely
unique
tasty
complex
and
worth
seeking
out
just
find
it
and
drink
it
body
is
very
smooth
and
buttery
with
a
soft
creamy
texture
and
amazing
drinkability
another
superb
product
from
a
brewer
that
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
thanks
to
ray
and
cornelia
who
shared
this
at
the
charlotte
ba
tasting
absolutely
beautiful
bottle
score
extra
points
hey
its
my
opinion
the
only
other
wild
ale
ive
had
is
also
from
russian
river
insanity
nice
copper
color
with
sour
grape
taste
and
smell
its
hard
to
be
wild
over
this
style
but
i
believe
russian
river
has
nailed
it
ill
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
on
occasion
and
id
like
to
try
it
with
a
heavy
meal
perhaps
some
tritip
and
mashed
potatoes
i
heart
this
beer
hazy
orangeybrown
with
floaties
and
a
white
1inch
head
aroma
is
stong
cherries
as
soon
as
the
cork
is
popped
vinous
with
a
faint
band
aid
aroma
taste
is
sour
cherries
and
grapes
vinous
vinegary
alcohol
sourness
hides
any
hop
or
malt
complexities
mouthfeel
is
nice
bubbly
creamymedium
body
drinkability
is
hindered
by
extreme
sourness
alcohol
not
my
style
as
i
prefer
the
temptation
pours
an
amber
color
with
very
little
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
sour
but
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
expected
it
to
be
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
smooth
slightly
soured
but
very
mellow
some
fruits
linger
on
the
palate
as
does
a
light
bit
of
maltiness
the
aftertaste
is
very
inviting
the
body
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
very
nice
beer
pours
a
lightly
ambered
color
with
a
finger
of
head
over
top
that
falls
to
a
healthy
cover
over
top
clarity
is
moderate
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
without
apparent
carbonation
good
looker
nose
is
excellent
with
moderate
sourness
with
a
very
solid
backing
of
cherry
its
not
biting
but
very
inviting
almost
a
touch
of
acetonelike
aromas
that
i
associate
with
sour
browns
flavor
is
very
nice
mildly
sour
moving
towards
a
very
smooth
cherry
fruityness
finishing
with
a
light
tartness
aftertaste
is
very
solid
sour
cherry
that
lingers
well
in
to
the
finish
enticing
me
to
drink
more
and
more
of
this
beer
very
nice
balance
between
fruit
flavor
and
sour
tinge
a
mild
sourness
hangs
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
into
the
finish
as
well
very
excellent
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
it
doesnt
interfere
with
the
flavor
while
having
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
lively
drinkability
is
awesome
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
at
all
in
this
one
its
smooth
and
enjoyable
while
having
a
prominent
sour
character
the
fruityness
is
excellent
and
compliments
the
base
beer
excellently
well
worth
the
wait
a
rich
tangy
pour
with
bubbles
clinging
in
ribbons
on
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
a
soft
spritzy
flavor
with
gentle
hints
of
brets
similar
yet
remarkably
different
from
the
temptation
was
it
worth
the
8
99
a
bottle
lets
just
say
im
not
gonna
go
run
and
get
a
6
pack
its
quite
simply
remarkably
bizzare
and
flavorful
yet
somehow
completely
pulled
together
and
ultimately
refreshing
its
astonishingly
entincing
enaging
and
almost
consuming
drinkability
is
very
high
amazingly
complex
and
i
can
imagine
each
bottle
tasting
very
different
from
the
last
memorable
for
sure
simply
an
amazing
brew
with
a
fiery
orange
color
a
dynamic
and
vibrant
aroma
and
an
astonishing
medley
of
flavors
meticulous
balance
of
cherries
yeast
and
oak
producing
a
range
of
flavors
vinnie
does
great
work
with
sour
belgians
i
love
the
wine
barrel
aging
and
the
vinous
character
not
overthetop
wild
but
already
quite
complex
and
another
35
years
in
the
cellar
should
further
supplicate
this
vinnie
masterpiece
further
bought
this
bottle
375
ml
olive
green
batch
001
a
month
or
two
ago
and
finally
mustered
up
the
will
to
open
it
which
i
had
a
hard
time
doing
as
the
cork
was
a
bit
stubborn
i
served
it
just
below
cellar
temperature
in
a
flutegoblet
type
glass
ive
got
it
pours
a
beautiful
hazed
goldenorangepeach
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
2
fingers
of
tan
head
which
consists
of
small
bubbles
and
reduces
to
a
halfinch
sticking
to
the
glass
throughout
it
smells
sharply
tart
with
sweet
and
sour
cherries
notquitefresh
milk
oak
a
good
funkiness
and
grapes
currants
and
blackberries
which
show
up
later
its
really
making
my
mouth
water
wondering
how
its
gonna
taste
it
is
sourtart
but
not
as
powerful
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
theres
also
some
malts
sour
cherries
oak
the
fruits
i
mentioned
above
and
some
medicinal
and
vinous
qualities
the
pinot
noir
barrels
in
which
it
was
aged
contribute
mainly
to
the
aftertaste
which
has
grapes
blackberries
and
currants
and
a
dry
woody
coating
effect
similar
to
the
few
pinots
ive
tried
initially
the
body
is
sharp
and
dry
with
a
carbonation
that
is
high
but
not
prickly
and
it
evolves
from
being
light
and
airy
to
medium
and
smoother
quite
an
interesting
beer
and
one
that
tastes
like
a
gueuze
mixed
with
a
pinot
noir
hats
off
to
russian
river
for
attempting
such
a
mysterious
creation
my
only
complaint
as
others
have
noted
is
that
the
bottle
is
too
damn
small
but
other
than
that
keep
up
the
good
work
taste
is
fucking
amazing
great
pinot
noir
flavor
vanilla
cherries
oak
plus
dirty
barnyard
notes
slightly
sour
mouthfeel
is
great
just
like
that
of
the
temptation
i
had
before
this
just
as
impressive
as
temptation
ive
found
the
new
crack
drinkability
the
tartness
beats
down
the
palate
but
i
found
it
to
be
very
interesting
the
best
of
the
tasting
flight
we
had
thanks
to
cmaruschak
for
sharing

vinous
character
flavors
of
dark
cherry
and
light
spice
and
oak
the
flavoring
does
not
linger
too
long
though
the
finish
is
extremely
dry
and
feels
like
it
is
sucking
the
moisture
from
your
tongue
as
you
drink
it
the
finish
is
moderately
sour
and
peppery
overall
a
very
wellmade
and
enjoyable
beer
gotta
send
thanks
out
to
the
bum
for
yet
another
rrb
product
its
much
appreciated
overall
this
is
a
truly
interesting
brew
and
although
i
dont
love
it
quite
as
much
as
temptation
i
would
highly
recommend
it
if
you
want
to
try
something
funky
and
tart
one
note
though
is
that
i
really
felt
this
one
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
even
after
i
served
it
at
just
under
cellar
temp
reading
the
label
while
i
imbibe
its
tells
of
all
of
the
work
that
went
into
creating
such
a
brew
the
12
month
aging
in
french
oak
pinot
noir
barrels
for
one
year
with
three
strains
of
brettanomyces
lactobacillus
pediococcus
this
is
a
labor
of
love
brewer
vinnie
cilurzo
is
clearly
ahead
of
the
curve
in
his
creativity
bottle
poured
a
hazy
deep
red
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
slightly
offwhite
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
sour
cherries
and
oak
are
clearly
detectable
taste
has
a
clear
sour
cherries
feel
to
it
with
some
distinctive
note
of
acidity
and
oak
tartness
was
delectable
but
could
have
been
more
present
even
though
this
is
an
excellent
flemish
sour
i
though
it
could
have
had
more
tart
and
more
complexity
in
general
i
e
de
dolle
oerbier
reserva
id
definitely
take
more
rr
temptation
over
this
any
day
the
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
hue
with
a
short
foamy
white
head
i
served
this
one
up
in
a
tulip
glass
to
help
capture
the
aromas
the
smell
was
that
of
a
tart
lambic
with
note
of
toasted
oak
the
yeast
in
the
aroma
was
somewhat
remeniscent
of
orval
the
flavor
was
full
of
tart
cherries
oak
and
chardonnay
the
malt
fills
out
the
flavor
and
provides
a
medium
mouthfeel
considering
this
beer
is
7
abv
its
amazingly
smooth
very
drinkable
the
carbonation
is
tight
and
compliments
this
beers
punch
highly
recommended
if
you
can
score
a
bottle
i
recently
went
to
russian
river
brewing
and
sampled
6
different
belgian
beers
on
tap
all
were
excellent
but
supplication
was
notably
different
and
much
more
complex
than
those
on
tap
give
me
funky
cheese
some
grapes
some
apples
some
more
bottles
of
this
nectar
and
a
glass
astonishingly
drinkable
this
beer
is
so
simple
but
so
complex
it
is
genius
the
warmer
the
beer
became
the
sweeter
and
more
luscious
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
if
you
love
sour
beers
you
must
try
supplication
i
am
happy
i
purchased
a
bottle
online
from
rr
it
was
worth
every
cent
i
highly
recommended
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
drink
this
gem
the
mouthfeel
is
what
made
this
beer
for
me
very
champaign
like
supper
smooth
and
so
active
on
the
tongue
what
an
incredibly
fascinating
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
something
different
not
a
typical
beer
by
any
means
but
a
great
example
of
creativity
in
brewing
wish
i
had
more
of
these
a
real
eye
opener
in
terms
of
what
can
be
done
with
beer
in
the
u
s
this
is
an
awesome
sipper
definitely
give
this
a
whirl
if
you
like
flanders
reds
then
you
should
love
this
beer
if
you
expect
something
else
like
i
did
youll
be
disappointed
drinkability
wish
i
hadnt
had
the
first
half
of
this
with
cheese
tried
camambert
cheese
for
the
first
time
and
found
i
didnt
like
its
salty
taste
so
the
first
part
of
my
beer
experience
was
muted
thankfully
i
have
another
few
bottles
and
can
get
a
couple
more
before
they
disappear
overall
a
really
tasty
beer
one
that
i
will
be
sure
to
have
again
hopefully
many
times
quite
a
production
from
vinnie
would
you
expect
anything
else
though
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
i
took
3
bottles
home
and
have
had
8
tulips
of
this
beer
before
the
keg
was
killed
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
nice
tulip
glass
and
admired
it
for
awhile
i
got
a
nice
thick
bubbly
off
white
head
that
lingered
for
awhile
the
fruit
aromas
you
get
from
there
beer
are
very
pleasing
cheeries
and
citrus
i
really
enjoyed
the
carbonation
and
tart
taste
in
my
supplication
this
definitely
takes
on
some
characteristics
of
wine
or
champagne
which
is
a
nice
take
on
beer
i
will
surely
be
back
for
a
few
more
bottles
and
hopefully
find
it
on
tap
in
the
near
future

special
thanks
to
brewbacca
for
the
trade
awsome
beer
from
russian
river
and
vinnie
like
i
said
before
unlike
anything
ive
previously
had
almost
too
good
for
words
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
drinker
definitely
has
alot
of
craftsmanship
involved
i
would
have
it
again
on
another
special
occaision
notes
ehhh
a
pretty
classy
ho
a
small
head
coats
the
sides
as
you
drink
this
bad
boy
down
cherries
are
front
and
center
followed
by
the
taste
of
a
nice
champagne
yeast
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
before
this
was
followed
by
the
nice
flavors
of
a
mild
brown
ale
tart
but
not
overly
slow
with
a
tangy
middle
and
a
nice
ale
finish
just
a
real
gem
damn
this
was
good
hazy
peach
with
a
large
fluffy
head
that
dies
down
pretty
quickly
smell
is
very
strong
floral
and
herbal
characters
along
with
a
vinegary
smell
dominate
there
is
definitely
some
sour
cherry
in
there
and
a
woody
smell
taste
is
more
of
the
same
the
taste
is
a
tad
muted
but
well
done
a
tiny
bit
of
spicy
alcohol
shows
through
but
other
than
that
it
is
well
hidden
the
sourness
is
mild
in
this
brew
compared
to
most
of
the
belgian
lambics
ive
had
but
the
cherry
taste
seems
to
come
out
more
along
with
a
vinous
character
finish
is
very
clean
with
some
lingering
oak
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
pretty
thin
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
drinks
very
easily
very
interesting
brew
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
amberpink
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
a
good
14
of
head
lasts
the
whole
way
down
lovely
aroma
of
earth
with
a
slight
mustiness
behind
it
all
a
bright
sense
of
cherries
great
cherry
sourness
in
the
flavor
spiciness
aboundssomewhat
peppery
though
nowhere
near
as
hot
spicewise
as
catillions
rose
d
gambrinus
which
i
liken
this
to
the
tartsweet
combo
is
amazing
great
body
quite
amazing
this
is
a
lot
more
my
speed
then
the
similar
catillion
products
a
damn
fine
beer
and
a
great
product
by
american
brewers
for
sure
very
tasty
found
myself
holding
the
bottle
over
my
glass
trying
to
milk
out
any
remaining
drips
or
drops
of
beer
in
there
a
most
stupendous
creation
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
nice
sour
cherry
scent
laid
over
a
mild
malt
base
comprised
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
awesome
it
has
a
smooth
belgian
brown
ale
flavor
with
loads
of
sour
cherries
in
the
taste
it
goes
down
like
candy
and
finishes
sour
and
slightly
warm
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
love
everything
about
it
i
only
wish
it
came
in
bigger
bottles
drinkability
is
good
only
thing
hurting
this
one
is
price
i
think
about
10
at
the
vintage
cellar
when
they
have
it
thanks
to
george
i
now
have
one
in
my
cellar
man
this
was
really
good
so
easily
drinkable
at
10
i
wanted
to
savor
it
yet
had
a
tough
time
pacing
myself
to
get
the
fullest
enjoyment
possible
from
the
alltoosmall
bottle
another
gem
from
the
creative
minds
at
russian
river
really
nice
beer
picked
up
a
few
extras
to
cellar
wondering
how
the
fruit
will
change
as
its
pretty
subtle
now
may
fade
entirely
mouthfeel
is
smooth
winelike
chewy
but
pleasant
sweet
sour
as
this
brew
warms
it
becomes
even
funkier
simply
out
of
this
world
drinkability
this
one
reminds
me
of
an
oaky
flanders
red
ale
blended
with
a
geuze
very
satisfying
sipper
that
is
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
complexities
abound
very
expensive
stuff
here
i
could
have
purchased
a
rochefort
10
for
the
price
of
this
one
im
going
to
lay
down
my
other
bottle
for
a
few
months
and
see
what
happens
a
few
weeks
after
i
finally
got
to
try
this
on
tap
at
bctc
2005
and
there
was
no
diacetyl
component
at
all
which
left
us
with
beautiful
vinous
nutty
sweet
and
sour
flavors
of
cherries
vanilla
and
a
miraculous
drying
finish
generous
earthiness
with
a
funky
soily
apple
skin
yeastiness
this
goes
from
a
2
8
to
a
4
1
in
my
book
and
is
a
piece
of
art
very
nice
a
strange
and
wonderful
creation
this
is
certainly
a
thinking
beer
im
very
impressed
with
the
hopping
and
the
overall
complexity
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
from
russian
river
this
is
my
first
experience
i
have
one
more
to
age
for
a
year
and
am
hoping
it
will
sour
even
more

well
lets
be

if

very

you
coming
back
for
more
trying
to
figure
out
every
thing
that
is
going
on
by
the
end
of
the

though
my
palette
seemed
a
bit
wore
out
from
all
the
flavors
but
i
would
have
gladly
drank
a
750
of
this
excellent
all
around
brew
a
must
try
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
time
drinkability
this
is
hard
to
quantify
i
have
to
say
a
four
because
i
think
i
could
at
most
drink
maybe
three
glasses
of
it
its
a
sipping
beer
a
conversational
beer
not
a
session
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
belgian
lovers
as
well
as
beer
aficianados
trying
to
mature
the
tastes
of
a
yellow
beer
or
red
wine
drinking
friend
with
an
open
mind
update
after
a
year
i
drank
my
second
bottle
the
strong
cherry
has
melded
into
a
perfect
balance
with
the
malt
and
matured
brett
character
a
different
beer
then
it
was
but
as
good
if
not
better

i
like
this
alot
it
is
an
excellent
offering
from

highly
recommended

and
creamy
with
virbant
carbonation
that
dances
across
the
palate
each
subsequent
sip
leaves
me
in
anticipation
of
the
next
i
really
wish
this
bottle
was
750ml
as
im
dreading
the
end
of
my
glass
and
i
could
lust
after
each
sip
of
this
beer
all
day
truly
a
work
of
brewing
art
if
there
ever
was
one
and
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
most
complex
unique
and
well
built
beers
that
has
ever
graced
this
beer
drinkers
lips
highly
recommended
and
not
to
be
missed
vinnie
has
created
a
masterpiece
that
i
sincerely
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
drinking
again
many
thanks
to
irishsnake
for
the
amazing
opportunity
overall
the
only
reason
that
this
beer
isnt
straight
5s
is
due
to
the
fact
the
flavors
are
very
strong
in
this
and
quite
simply
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
apart
from
that
though
i
dont
see
much
fault
in
this
beer
at
all
i
kind
of
consider
myself
lucky
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
wow
this
is
truly
a
wow
nose
of
wild
yeast
cherry
goodness
that
i
whiffed
like
a
cigarette
inhale
after
the
loud
pop
from
the
champagne
cork
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
not
much
head
on
the
pour
i
was
not
sure
if
this
would
be
better
cold
or
warmer
so
i
took
a
big
first
drink
and
it
was
as
good
as
the
nose
it
had
tremendous
layers
of
flavors
with
an
easy
to
approach
funkiness
and
tartness
allowing
the
cherries
to
balance
this
complexity
and
hold
it
together
as
it
warms
and
your
palate
starts
to
love
the
tartness
the
buttery
oakiness
adds
yet
another
layer
of
flavor
and
the
cherry
flavors
come
forward
beautifully
it
was
8
00
for
a
12oz
bottle
at
ledgers

pricey
but
worth
a
try
to
see
what
american
brewers
are
capable
of
when
their
obsession
matches
their
talent
while
the
cherry
flavor
never
fully
emerged
i
was
certainly
treated
to
a
subtly
sour
beverage
that
was
impressively
well
balanced
and
dry
if
one
could
register
a
complaint
its
that
a
leisurely
approach
to
drinking
this
allows
it
warm
to
the
point
where
a
slightly
boozy
red
wine
burn
develops
that
distracts
from
the
interesting
funk
and
wood
flavors
present
in
the
beer
nonetheless
quite
an
accomplishment
another
amazing
boundarypushing
beer
from
vinnie
i
only
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
cellar
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
this
beer
will
become
doubly
amazing
with
a
few
years
on
it
a
shame
the
bottle
is
so
small
as
this
is
extremely
enjoyable
wish
i
had
more
than
half
a
bottle
to
taste
but
glad
niftypat
shared
it
with
me
definetly
need
to
find
some
more
bottles
of
this
for
a
beer
this
is
something
else
leaps
and
bounds
beyond
the
flemish
wild
ales
but
just
a
tad
bit
less
crazy
than
the
hype
will
lead
you
to
believe

im
not
sure
i
am
worthy
of
such
a
gift
by
far
the
best
american
beer
i
have
had
this
year
it
is
beers
like
this
that
inspire
and
show
where
modern
american
brewers
can
go
there
are
no
boundaries
dark
orangeishred
with
a
nice
head
of
light
beigetan
foam
that
dies
kind
of
quickly
but
is
easily
revitalized
by
swirling
my
oversized
wine
glass
some
lace
is
present
as
well
and
it
is
quite
sticky
and
leaves
some
interesting
patterns
the
aromas
are
all
brett
lacto
and
sour
cherryoaky
funk
beautiful
the
taste
is
a
beautiful
blend
of
funk
oak
cherries
acidic
notes
and
more
the
mouthfeel
is
super
creamy
smooth
and
this
beautiful
brew
just
slides
down
ones
throat
drinkability
is
perfect
as
well
this
is
similar
yet
different
than
alexander
rodenbach
but
man
this
stuff
is
probably
better
just
a
brilliant
flemish
red
sort
of
hybrid
oaky
cherry
brew
one
more
note
im
hesitant
to
send
in
a
change
of
style
request
since
i
am
certainly
no
expert
on
belgian
sour
ales
but
the
big
malt
here
makes
me
think
that
this
is
more
of
a
brown
oud
bruin
than
a
red
however
this
is
aged
in
oak
old
pinot
noir
barrels
so
who
knows
o
this
met
my
expectations
i
have
to
put
ddg
ahead
of
this
just
on
complexity
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
seeking
out
id
like
to
try
this
fresh
but
a
little
age
has
been

still
not
quite

one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
without
a
doubt
amazing
how
many
different
fruit
and
other
aromasflavors
come
out
of
this
beer
from
the
combination
of
bacteria
and
yeasts
without
actually
having
any
fruit
pretty
much
every
aspect
of
it
was
fantastic
down
to
the
perfect
mouth
feel
its
not
often
outside
of
a
big
stoutbarleywine
that
i
say
to
myself
wow
this
beer
has
a
great
mouth
feel
but
it
was
there
all
right
sours
are
not
my
favorite
i
almost
feel
unqualified
to
rate
them
but
to
me
this
one
fits
right
into
the
rr
lineup
people
hold
it
in
higher
regard
for
some
reason
that
is
beyond
my
palate
but
its
absolutely
worth
drinking

you
are

o
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
it
made
me
a
little
burpy
but
that
goes
with
the
territory
im
a
huge
fan
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
benefits
from
a
little
age
this
is
my
favorite
sour
that
has
ever
touched
my
lips
o
this
is
an
excellent
sour
though
not
for
the
uninitiated
maybe
lacking
the
complexity
and
subtleties
needed
to
make
it
truly
world
class
but
wonderful
nonetheless
pours

very
little

smells
fresh

hints

wow
this
is
sour
what
i
get
after
that
initial
pucker
is
fresh
citrus
earthiness
and
a
smooth
vanilla
oak
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
ive
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
the
natural
fermentation
yields
a
perfect
feel
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sours
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
a
clear
pale
yellow
pouring
into
the
glass
you
can
tell
this
thing
is
nose
and
tongue
stingly
tart
tastes
bright
citrus
grapefruit
and
lemon
with
crisp
clean
acidity
tastes
like
the
sour
candies
of
your
childhood
so
complex
and
tart
and
the
body
on
it
is
great
just
enough
to
hold
up
the
acidity
right
up
there
with
the
most
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
had
o
a
very
good
sour
i
find
picking
out
flavors
in
sours
are
difficult
but
the
taste
and
smell
and
everything
about
it
are
outstanding
single
finger
fizzy
white
head
on
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
body
aroma
of
chardonnay
white
grapes
lemon
zest
funk
tropical
fruit
and
nicely
forbodes
the
level
of
tartness
the
taste
has
in
store
the
first
sip
has
the
salivary
glands
contracting
and
its
so
tart
initially
it
is
almost
bad
but
its
just
enough
to
be
perfect
as
you
get
used
to
it
the
flavors
pop
with
lemon
white
wine
fruits
chardonnay
and
granny
smith
sour
apples
oak
is
light
its
only
knock
for
me
is
it
lacks
a
little
complexity
likely
because
it
is
so
tart
the
other
flavors
are
lost
crisp
light
body
with
the
sourness
drying
you
out
quite
a
bit
another
great
sour
from
rr
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
beyond
oblown
away
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
it
surpassed
them
by
a
mile
it
is
going
to
be
hard
to
ever
find
a
sour
better
than
this
you
must
get
this
beer
if
you
can
o
outstanding
i
braced
myself
against
the
hype
preparing
for
this
to
be
underwhelming
and
was
wrong
beatification
is
every
bit
deserving
of
the
hype
a
very
big
thanks
to
mulder1010
for
this
and
it
pours
a
beautiful
golden
hazy
hue
with
a
one
finger
wispy
head
and
a
touch
of
lacingthe
smell
is
so
inviting
its
oakgreen
applesmusty
funk
and
white
grapesthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
and
on
taste
its
just
like
a
fine
lambic
you
would
find
in
belgium
with
sour
granny
smith
applesoakwhite
grapes
and
finished
with
a
nice
sour
tartness
and
overall
its
a
nice
wild
ale
but
temptation
is
still
my
favourite
cheers
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
had
and
if
youre
looking
for
something
that
delivers
in
the
pucker
department
seek
this
one
out
it
is
also
somewhat
too
sour
for
me
in
my
tastes
its
missing
a
bit
of
the
subtlety
that
i
got
from
supplication
still
an
amazing
beer
and
if
you
want
to
test
the
limits
of
sour
seek
it
out
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
beer
for
almost
2
years
now
what
differentiates
it
from
other
wild
ales
ive
tried
is
the
mouth
puckering
sourness
that
it
delivers
as
with
other
rr
sours
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
complex
this
ones

some

sour

lots
of
lactic
tartness
dry
oak
dry
dusty
geuzelike
qualities
yet
a
nice

character
to
balance
some
wine
like
qualities
with
sauvignon
blanc
type
of
acidity
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
this
is
really
nice
but
i
cant
ever
see
paying
18
for
a
small
bottle
myself
differentiating
sour
beers
is
tough
i
guess
with
that
said
no
doubt
i
would
drink
this
again
yum
i
knew
other
sours
made
by
rr
were
already
worldclass
but
this
really
took
it
home
for
me
this
is
not
an
easy
beer
to
make
and
to
produce
something
that
is
so
complex
and
yet
so
brightly
textured
and
balanced
when
working
with
wild
bacterial
strains
is
nothing
short
of
magic
for
those
who
have
had
any
doubt
on
the
direction
that
wild
beers
are
taking
in
america
try
this
one
and
be
astonished
this
is
by
far
the
leader
of
many
beautiful
things
to
come
i
hope
to
get
a
bottle
soon
and
compare
some
notes
and
see
how
this
changes
over
time
this
is
one
of
the
loveliest
beers
i
have
seen
in
the
glass
it
looks
like
champagne
the
nose
is
subtle
and
slightly
funky
not
the
strongest
part
of
the
beer
beatification
has
a
deep
lemon
juiciness
that
is
incredible
it
is
followed
by
a
wellbalanced
pucker
that
doesnt
have
you
reaching
for
the
tums
the
finish
is
nice
and
astringent
which
is
the
perfect
lead
in
to
the
the
next
sip
up
there
with
supplication
as
the
best
from
russian

while

was
more
of
a

just
enough
to
make
this
incredibly
mouthpuckering
but
without
overcoming
all
the
different
complexities
in
the
flavour
highly
recommend
drinking
fresh
within
a
year
for
the
full
bouquet
of
flavours
to
enjoy
o
i
was
not
the
least
bit
disapointed
by
this
beer
with
the
high
hopes
that
i
had
for
it
the
sour
aspect
of
this
beer
is
very
unique
for
an
american
beer
o
just
want
this
aged
maybe
a
year
or
two
cant
wait
to
try
it
then
finally
this
is
one
beer
i
have
wanted
to
try
more
than
any
other
it
was
my
number
one
whale
and
now
it
has
been
enjoyed
at
long
last
and
it
did
not
disappoint
hazy
blonde
in
color
without
a
ton
of
head
but
some
clearish
white
fizz
holds
on
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
beer
is
visibly
bubbly
even
though
not
much
head
ever
accumulates
looks
like
a
gueuze
the
nose
is
awesome
just
awesome
not
overly
sour
as
say
consecration
but
it
definitely
brings
a
pucker
for
me
lots
of
musty
wood
too
wine
citrus
overtones
and
a
vinegar
hit
on
the
back
end
i
taste
grain
first
which
really
surprises
me
and
its
more
musty
than
sour
sanctification
has
a
certain
acidity
not
found
here
but
the
sour
element
is
very
similar
the
finish
is
long
even
though
its
really
dry
i
taste
it
for
miles
furthermore
i
get
this
harvest
time
straw
or
hay
element
grassy
but
not
from
hops
its
wheated
all
the
way
through
and
while
being
sour
is
also
so
much
more
in
terms
of
yeast
its
beautiful
beer
really
bright
carbonation
and
a
body
short
of
medium
it
drinks
really
easy
because
its
not
so
acidic
not
as
interesting
or
layered
as
some
of
the
other
sours
but
a
great
example
of
a
wild
ale
one
of
the
best
i
can
remember
comes
up
just
short
of
the
hype
but
thats
still
a
remarkable
achievement
with
this
one
a
well
made
beer
but
the
tartness
for
me
was
a
bit
too
aggressive
however
recently
have
batch
5
i
much
preferred
the
restrained
manner
and
less
tart
qualities
in
the
beer
well
done
among
my
top
three
wilds
to
date
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
it
is
lighter
than
blonde
and
just
barely
lemontinted
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
bright
white
head
plenty
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
complex
there
is
some
tartnessacid
scent
but
very
funky
to
my
nose
i
get
more
funk
than
anything
like
preserved
lemons
maybe
the
taste
is
sour
on
the
front
end
but
bright
in
the
tartness
this
tastes
like
a
lemon
sour
patch
kid
to
me
the
sour
is
balanced
so
well
and
doesnt
finish
acetic
you
get
a
bit
of
the
wood
and
the
sourness
really
smoothes
out
as
this
warms
i
really
enjoy
lemons
so
this
beer
really
hits
the
spot
its
just
this
side
of
sour
to
not
be
completely
thirst
quenching
which
is
good
because
its
not
like
anybody
has
a
big
enough
stash
to
throw
back
a
few
of
these
probably
as
balanced
and
as
well
made
as
any
sour
ive
had
slightly
ahead
of
cantillon
gueuze
for
me
in
terms
of
bright
lemony
lambic
had
a
batch
3
just
last
week
and
it
turned
much
sourer
than
this
fresh
batch
both
versions
extremely
good
love
it
t
hits
with
a
big
tart
slightly
acetic
lemony
twang
that
carries
through
all
the
way
to
midpalate
some
underripe
red
cherry
and
lemon
candy
hit
in
the
middle
barnyard
wet
hay
a
touch
of
leather
vanilla
and
some
oak
sticks
the
finish
intensely
tart
and
lemony
with
a
great
lingering
dryness
like
every
rr
sour
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
impeccable
this
is
world
class
poured
a
bright
golden
yellow
nice
two
finger
head
with
a
somewhat
aggressive

oak
the
taste
is
very
sour
with
a
lot
of
lemon
perhaps
some
oak
grass
and
pepper
on
the
backend
very
dry
as
well
creamy
mouthfeel
with
bubbles
that
coat
the
tongue
and
keep
the
tartness
around
for
a
while
if
you
like
really
sour
beers
this
is
a
great
one
beatification
is
russian
rivers
100
spontaneously
fermented
sour
that
is
made
in
homage
to
some
of
the
great
lambic
producers
of
belgium
cantillion
drie
fontenien
etc
the
finished
product
is
extremely
complex
and
highly
recommended
the
aroma
is
unmistakably
tart
with
a
lemonyorange
hop
character
dry
and
peppery
with
a
tart
sourness
that
pops
on
the
palate
incredible
o
the
mellowness
of
this
beer
makes
it
the
most
drinkable
sour
ive
ever
had
is
it
the
best
its
hard
to
say
they
all
taste
somewhat
similar
within
their
respective
styles
to
me
95
m
supereffervescent
and
light
bodied
bounces
off
the
palate
medium

aftertaste
and
is
extremely
drinkable
finishes
dry
i
went
through
a
lot
of
trouble
to
get
this
beer
and
may
need
to
go
through
the
trouble
again
as
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
it
as
far
as
a
non
fruited
sour
beatification
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
not
a
sour
for
those
who
are
just
venturing
into
the
world
of
sour
ales
i
have
been
getting
really
into
sours
the
past
few
years
its
an
exciting
time
to
be
doing
so
since
there
are
more
and
more
options
popping
up
and
many
of
them
are
truly
delicious
beatification
is
among
the
very
best
i
have
had
it
definitely
is
one
of
the
most
intense
sours
out
there
although
the
flavor
is
extreme
this
is
incredibly
well
balanced
and
pleasurable
to
drink
a
true
delight
maybe
the
closest
to
a
really
good
gueuze
i
can
think
of
coming
out
of
america
i
love
supplication
and
consecration
and
this
is
a
refreshing
change
to
straight
spontaneous
ferment
flavors
sourness
dominates
but
lots
of
other
great
flavors
beyond
that
o
a
serious
contender
for
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
not
far
from
drinking
lemon
juice
honestly
surprisingly
pleasant
not
a
lot
of
funk
to
this
one
just
straightup
bracing
sourness
i
expected
more
funkiness
due
to
the
brett
and
the
almost
2year
old
bottle
i
think
the
sourness
just
obliterates
anything
else
i
actually
prefer
this
sort
of
sour
its
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
but
drinkability
does
suffer
due
to
the
extreme
sourness
not
exactly
a
sesssionable
brew
but
thats
not
the
point
of
course
overall
this
is
a
prime
example
of
the
mastery
vinnie
possesses
a
work
of
balance
very
puckering
but
not
overly
so
less
funky
than
most
traditional
gueuzes
but
where
it
lacks
funk
it
makes
up
in
other
nuances
that
make
the
beer
just
as
divine
if
not
more
unique
which
i
believe
is
the
intention
so
yeah
overall
this
is
pretty
phenomenal
one
of
the
few
beers
that
has
made
my
perpetual
want
list
i
might
like
consecration
a
bit
more
overall
but
i
would
rather
be
drinking
this
its
funny
to
say
but
this
is
the
most
entertaining
sour
ive
ever
tried
lets
hope
i
can
get
more
soon
another
wonderful
wild
ale
put
forth
by
russian
river
brewery
excellent
beer
definitely
a
sipper
and
not
something
i
could
enjoy
on
a
daily
basis
but
a
treat
nevertheless
o
outstanding
o
this
might
be
the
sourest
beer
ive
ever
had
its
still
quite
refreshing
though
another
lovely
sour
brew
to
get
me
through
these
ridiculously
90
temps
o
wow
i
knew
this
would
be
good
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
good
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
a
beautifully
crafted
wile
ale
do
whatever
you
can
to
get
this
beer
it
is
amazing
o
damn
why
did
i
trade
so
many
of
these
away
this
beer
is
extraordinary
it
doesnt
need
any
more
explanation
than
that
trade
for
it
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
sour
exceptional
smell
and
really
delicious
this
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
cutting
this
with
temptation
and
supplication
really
took
the
edge
off
and
thats
kind
of
scary
o
one
of
my
new
favorite
sours
the
tartness
dominates
everything
but
is
soooo
good
absolutely
great
beer
and
amongst
the
best
ive
had
from
russian
river
o
a
really
tart
sour
that
closely
resembles
a
belgian
gueuze
this
one
definitely
goes
to
the
sour
side
as
it
has
minimal
funk
to
it
had
an
earlier
batch
at
jeffs
house
thanks
jeff
and
this
stuff
was
even
better
than
i
remembered
so
impossibly
sour
and
so
incredibly
drinkable
ive
never
been
more
sad
to
see
an
empty
glass
my
friend
in
san
francisco
broke
one
of
these
out
as
my
introduction
to
sours
i
was
blown
away
this
is
a
sour
that
is
truly
sour
without
any
overtones
of
fruitiness
it
finishes
leaving
you
wanting
more
and
more
and
more
impossible
to
drink
quickly
because
after
the
first
sip
you
know
you
have
come
across
something
special
this
is
my
current
favorite
beer
if
you
have
a
chance
to
taste
any
of
the
russian
river
sours
try
this
one
first
it
will
blow
your
mind
this
poure
out
as
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
pretty
decent
white
hea
on
top
the
lacing
was
thin
but
the
retention
held
up
pretty
well
the
smell
is
strong
as
hell
lots
of
powerful
sour
notes
on
top
of
some
subtle
vinegar
very
acidic
aromas
the
taste
follows
the
nose
i
nearly
had
tears
in
my
eyes
from
how
sour
this
was
the
flavors
of
violent
oak
aging
with
brett
and
vinegar
all
come
together
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
nicely
carbonated
and
leaves
me
with
a
salavating
pucker
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
sour
things
ive
ever
had
its
brutal
and
not
something
i
would
ever
drink
a
lot
of
still
it
fits
the
style
and
is
sure
to
please
anyone
who
seeks
these
type
of
beers
o
great
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
every
bit
as
good
as
supplication
overall
incredible
i
liked
supplication
more
but
never
the
less
this
is
awesome
overall
beatification
is
a
fantastic
geuze
yes
i
consider
this
a
geuze
not
an
american
wild
ale
and
is
one
of
the
few
american
sours
that
i
think
will
stand
up
well
to
its
belgian
counterparts
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
one
develops
over
time
bottle
deep
hazy
golden
like
the
tipical
cantillon
minimal
head
though
aroma
is
barnyard
brett
and
leather
but
also
very
fruity
mango
oranges
and
apricot
very
wild
and
expressive
taste
is
citrusy
tart
but
not
very
dry
it
reminds
me
of
a
lemon
pie
with
candied
zests
lemon
is
puckering
but
sweetness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
slight
musty
feel
it
sure
aint
a
perfect
beer
but
it
taste
goddamn
good
it
feels
almost
like
a
pure
lambic
and
is
definitly
one
step
ahead
from
the
regular
american
wild
i
slightly
prefer
temptation
to
this
one
but
it
deifnitly
hit
the
spot
in
its
category
o
beautiful
aroma
tasty
and
good
drinkability
which
is
limited
mostly
by
the
level
of
sourness
overall
an
awesome
brew
very
sour
and
really
delicious
enjoying
it
immensely
i
wish
this
was
easier
to
acquire
but
well
worth
trading
for
certainly
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
favorites
awesome
stuff
o
this
is
a
very
bright
lemony
blend
i
would
have
liked
more
funk
but
this
is
still
good
i
like
consecration
better
though
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
love
the
sour
but
wish
i
could
taste
past
it
i
would
definitely
trade
for
it
again
cost
15
for
a
375ml
bottle
amazing
tangy
has
never
seemed
a
more
apt
adjective
had
high
expectations
and
was
not
at
all
disappointed
the
sort
of
beer
that
renders
conventional
aroma
and
flavour
nouns
largely
obsolete
as
meaningful
descriptors
of
character
overall
this
is
a
really
sour
really
good
beer
it
may
be
slightly
one
dimensional
but
its
really
good
at
what
it
aims
to
do
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
search
out
more
in
the
future
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
but
doesnt
last
long
aroma
is
full
of
tart
citrus
like
lemon
zest
and
grapefruit
maybe
a
touch
of
green
apple
and
oak
flavor
is
so
full
and
complex
and
overwhelmingly
sour
somewhat
to
its
detriment
i
think
i
enjoy
a
well
blended
sour
like
temptation
to
unblended
i
enjoy
the
wild
fermentation
process
to
get
these
amazingly
complex
beers
but
the
sourness
somewhat
detracts
from
what
it
is
your
drinking
flavor
is
like
strong
lemon
mixed
with
touches
of
green
apple
like
the
nose
suggests
but
extremely
sour
not
much
funk
its
a
nice
and
fresh
sour
mouthfeel
is
great
low
carbonation
probably
helps
with
the
high
acidity
in
this
beer
overall
great
beer
for
being
unblended
glad
i
got
to
try
it
definitely
had
to
rest
the
tastebuds
after
this
one
o
wow
what
can
i
say
looks
like
pee
smell
is
good
but
ive
had
better
but
then
you
take
the
first
sip
and
bam
just
pure
unadulterated
sour
bliss
my
favorite
of
the
rr
sours
and
the
most
sour
beer
i
have
had
to
date
id
write
more
but
i
have
to
get
over
to
the
trade
forum
to
post
as
iso
beat
ft
first
born
son
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
however
i
think
i
enjoy
the
balance
of
the
other
rr
sours
to
this
one
i
still
have
one
for
the
cellar
so
i
am
hoping
that
the
funk
comes
up
a
bit
and
gives
it
more
balance
overall
this
beer
was
worth
the
hype
big
thanks
to
my
buddy
josh
for
getting
this
for
me
as
a
wedding
gift
major
beer
karma
comin
your
way
this
beer
did
it
all
without
trying
to
do
too
much
just
amazing
o
having
had
all
the
other
rr
offerings
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
i
got
a
beer
that
had
enough
complexity
to
keep
a
smile
on
my
face
and
enough
lactic
sourness
to
burn
a
hole
through
ones
stomach
not
particularly
balanced
but
intense
and
a
fantastic
example
of
what
american
wilds
can
be
would
love
to
try
this
with
a
bit
more
age
on
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
smells
like
a
grapefruit
tart
when
i
tasted
this
it
reminded
me
when
i
was
kid
and
i
like
to
buy
these
atomic
sour
candies
when
you
bite
into
it
it
bites
back
with
a
scourge
of
sourness
throughout
that
is
the
best
description
for
this
brew
and
i
like
it
really
sour
tart
lemon
and
just
awesome

d
a

categories
were
borderline

so
hence
a
5

here
this
is
the
first
rr
sour
that
has
truly
impressed
me
since
i
first
had
tempation
solid
all
around
375ml
b2
courtesy
of
mrchopin
ive
been
debating
about
upping
the
score
from
4
3
to
4
4
seeing
that
i
dream
of
this
beer
on
an
almost
constant
basis
this
my
third
time
trying
the
beer
has
confirmed
that
it
is
time
beatification
b2
is
so
drying
and
so
wildy
complex
with
spicy
cedar

leather
peaches

it
is
an
all
encompassing
sour
experience
that
is
never
acedic
never
citric
just
spot
on
perfection
my
notes
for
this
say
its
like
the
world
ended
and
i
was
resurrected
in
paradise
later
on
into
the

o
i
can
see
why
people
rave
about
this
beer
but
for
the
effort
involved
id
rather
just
drink
boon
mariage
parfait
although
beat
is
a
better
brew
its
just
barely
so
4
o
this
is
one
of
the
absolute
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
completely
worth
the
price
tag
and
cost
from
shipping
from
cali
if
youre
a
fan
of
sours
and
youve
never
had
this
well
what
the
hell
are
you
waiting
for
o
probably
one
of
the
most
pungent
and
interesting
sours
that
ive
had
to
date
o
for
what
this
took
to
get
im
a
bit
disappointed
it
just
tasted
a
bit
average
for
me
the
aggressive
sour
is
impressive
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
doesnt
entirely
back
it
up
nice
and
light
on
the
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
great
wonderfully
drinkable
this
is
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
real
treat
one
id
love
to
have
more
of
o
all
three
of
these
were
really
good
my
batch
2
was
definitely
the
most
sour
batch
3
was
probably
my
favorite
since
it
was
the
most
balanced
and
batch
5
just
tasted
a
little
raw
compared
to
the
other
two
this
was
a
seriously
delicious
test
overall
my
favorite
russian
river
sour
its
just
a
seriously
delicious
sour
beer
that
packs
a
hardcore
sour
punch
its
also
one
of
the
top
american
wild
ales
that
i
have
been
privilaged
to
try
overall
excellent
beer
overall
russian
river
really
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
i
cant
imagine
a
sour
beer
getting
much
better
than
this
i
cant
recommend
it
enough
beatification
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
theres
maybe
a
fingers
worth
of
white
foam
crowning
the
beer
and
it
disappears
quickly
and
quietly
the
nose
has
a
good
bit
of
acidity
to
it
its
very
citric
with
some
bright
lemon
poking
through
theres
also
a
good
bit
of
funk
some
earthiness
and
also
pineappletropical
fruits
the
flavor
follows
suit
displaying
the
full
potential
of
wild
yeastbacteria
the
tartness
is
perfect
bold
and
attention
grabbing
without
turning
the
beer
into
vinegar
a
brief
flash
of
lemon
opens
the
beer
nicely
before
a
tiny
bit
of
oak
and
some
earthy
and
fruity
funk
come
in
and
fill
the
mid
palate
the
acidity
comes
back
in
for
a
lingering
finish
the
body
is
just
a
little
bit
full
and
the
carbonation
a
little
bit
lifeless
and
combined
theyre
enough
to
make
mouthfeel
just
feel
off
despite
one
or
two
minor
quibbles
beatification
is
a
fantastic
sour
beer
its
managed
to
not
only
live
up
to
all
the
community
generated
hype
but
all
the
anticipation
i
had
for
it
personally
after
getting
to
try
only
an
ounce
or
two
at
a
tasting
a
few
years
ago
im
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
tucked
away
in
the
cellar
overallmouthfeel
mouthfeel
is
perfect
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
a
damn
nice
wild
that
i
was
excited
to
try
and
would
definitely
have
again
o
this
is
quite
sour
but
thats
pretty
much
it
nothing
too
complex
and
am
confused
why
this
is
considered
a
top
wild
from
rr
have
had
a
few
others
from
them
and
this
just
seems
to
lack
any
depth
their
other
offerings
had
glad
i
got
to
finally
try
it
but
wouldnt
really
seek
it
out
o
their
wild
ales
are
just
ridiculous
amazing
spring
beer
taste
wow
immediately
reminds
me
why
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
russian
tion
beers
and
then
it
makes
me
pontificate
whether
i
like
this
more
than
framboise
for
a
cure
or
pty
yup
that
good
body
is
light
taste
sour
power
is
heavy
keeps
the
brett
aspect
down
lets
the
other
germs
dominate
never
approaches
anything
that
could
be
considered
vinegaresque
oak
notes
are
mild
its
all
about
orange
type
citrus
notes
dry
and
earthy
hyper
drive
sour
so
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
beatification
this
beer
blew
me
away
as
much
as
any
cantillon
ive
ever
had
overall
for
the
style
this
is
a
good
beer
but
for
me
i
find
it
hard
to
drink
and
could
not
see
myself
finishing
a
whole
bottle
not
a
fan
of
the
style
in
general
o
another
great
sour
from
russian
river
i
prefer
supplication
and
consecration
over
this
one
o
this
was
an
awesome
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
taste
and
aroma
are
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
sours
including
the
cantillons
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
then
the
supplication
i
had
earlier
a
lot
more
funk
more
citrusy
and
more
overall
flavor
etc
definitely
a
must
try
if
you
are
into
sours
wish
the
brewery
was
on
the
east
coast
this
beer
as
well
as
any
other
rr
beer
ive
had
definatly
lives
up
to
all
the
hype
some
very
nice
funk
and
intense
sour
citrus
makes
this
a
winner
right
up
there
with
cantillion
imo
o
fantastic
beer
its
mega
sour
and
super
delicious
this
is
a
true
standout
for
wild
ale
fans
it
deserves
every
bit
of
praise
that
it
gets
fantastic
overall
very
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
sour
beers
are
quite
foreign
to
me
and
gems
like
these
make
me
excited
to
try
more
o
simply
put
amazing
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
great
flavor
and
extremely
tart
this
is
like
sour
concentrate
its
like
alchemy
but
with
sour
flavor
in
a
word
this
is
masterful
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
russian
river
and
that
is
really
saying
something
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
its
worth
all
the
hype
and
it
would
likely
age
incredibly
well
definitely
a
top
showing
from
an
already
top
level
brewery
incredible
stuff
to
be
had
too
bad
i
dont
have
more
o
such
a
great
sour
really
hard
to
complain
about
any
aspect
but
still
isnt
quite
on
par
with
some
of
the
big
boys
darn
close
though
only
knock
is
as
it
warms
it
becomes
a
tad
too
acidic
for
my
tastes
love
this
sour
though
and
cannot
wait
for
the
next
bottle
o
if
you
like
sour
and
funk
this
beer
is
for
you
possibly
the
second
most
sour
beer
i
have
had
next
to
riserva
2010
o
this
is
really
brilliant
stuff
particularly
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
palate
scraping
sour
highly
recommended
and
i
think
rr
has
finally
caught
up
to
belgium
depends
on
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
rounded
sour
or
a
bracing
one
d
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
while
staying
refined
love
it
pours
with
a
great
funky
earthy
hay
lemon
smell
rich
golden
color
somewhat
hazy
very
tart
on
the
tongue
with
earthy
leathery
undertones
not
at
all
astringent
but
rather
finished
crisp
and
cleanly
acidic
excellent
beer
lighter
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
dry
bubbly
and
extremely
lingering
on
the
tongue
if
youre
looking
for
an
intensely
sour
beer
that
packs
a
punch
you
wont
soon
forget
this
is
the
one
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
couple
years
and
its
lived
up
to
the
expectations
o
very
delicious
beer
wish
it
were
easier
and
cheaper
for
rr
to
make
this
is
a
pretty
special
one
for
botg
62
pretty
hard
to
find
thanks
to
kevin
harvest
for
his
generosity
here
rr
corked
and
caged
bottle
popped
bottle
and
poured
slowly
into
my
jk
farmhouse
glass
pours
a
really
cloudy
golden
color
some
white
tight
bubbles
in
the
head
it
looks
like
a
sour
it
actually
resembles
a
gueuze
in
a
lot
of
ways
smell
sour
green
apples
citrus
earthy
funk
i
get
some
eastern
asia
tropical
fruits
like
a
star
fruit
very
tart
aroma
also
some
vinegar
aroma
so
many
things
in
common
with
a
good
gueuze
taste
oh
my
god
puckering
sour
its
the
sour
you
get
from
biting
right
into
a
green
apple
unripened
and
gnawing
on
the
skin
there
is
a
sugary
tartness
on
my
teeth
also
i
get
some
sour
patch
kids
sourness
too
definite
vinegar
present
on
the
end
it
works
well
with
the
sourness
not
a
detractor
at
all
this
is
an
a
sour
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
for
sure
o
acidic
interesting
sour
and
perhaps
a
touch
overrated
still
a
wellmade
beer
that
deserves
your
attention
i
would
have
another
d
very
drinkable
the
sourness
and
funky
flavors
are
so
strong
but
at
the
same
time
the
beer
feels
very
balanced
i
really
like
the
wild
yeast
flavors
d
i
see
where
it
gets
its
high
marks
overall
the
beer
is
not
very
complex
but
still
a
excellent
beer
from
vinny
and
rr
pours
a
slightly
murky
yellow
with
a
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
funky
earthy
and
woody
taste
is
the
same
with
an
awesome
mouth
puckering
sourness
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
with
fantastic
aromas
and
flavors
overall
not
a
lot
of
complexity
imo
very
one
note
sour
sour
lemony
citrus
great
job
vin
hell
i
even
drank
the
sediment
the
drinkability
on
this
is
nuts
i
could
down
these
all
the
time
perfect
summer
beer
complex
light
and
refreshing
each
sip
finishes
with
this
pleasant
tartness
that
just
makes
me
want
to
keep
drinking
more
please
o
this
beer
is
like
nothing
else
the
difference
between
the
smell
and
the
taste
is
something
else
would
be
interesting
to
drink
a
sanctification
right
next
to
it
awesome
beer
but
for
15
bucks
a
pop
ill
be
trading
it
more
than
drinking
it
this
is
the
best
american
wild
ale
ive
had
sans
fruit
just
fucking
outstanding
really
sour
and
good
maybe
worth
the
effort
to
get
it
though
o
this
is
a
remarkably
good
awa
it
makes
me
think
of
a
young
gueuze
blend
more
than
any
nonfruited
awa
ive
had
for
a
style
that
strives
to
be
as
good
as
something
out
of
belgium
rr
has
done
it
here
i
find
it
to
be
slightly
less
layered
and
complex
than
the
best
gueuze
ive
had
but
not
by
much
o
awesome
given
the
pita
that
this
ended
up
being
for
me
to
acquire
my
hopes
had
really
been
built
up
but
unlike
so
many
previous
experiences
with
a
similar
backstory
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
easily
bottles
of
beat
would
absolutely
be
a
permanent
fixture
in
my
fridge
if
that
was
possible
drink
its
good
but
didnt
blow
me
away
i
can
see
what
the
fuss
was
about
though
and
very
glad
i
have
another
bottle
at
home
really
good
reminded
me
a
bit
of
temptation
but
much
more
sour
and
intense
had
a
hard
time
picking
up
on
any
barrel
characteristics
the
beer
is
a
light
yellow
with
tremendous
carbonation
it
smells
like
sweet
acetone
sourness
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
with
intense
sourness
the
beer
is
incredibly
drying
and
has
a
dank
aftertaste
that
lingers
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
with
its
sourness
whoa
tasty
beer
and
i
would
compare
it
to
a
bottle
of
cantillon
any
day
o
i
love
this
one
the
closest
thing
i
can
compare
this
to
is
temptation
but
this
one
packs
more
punch
and
sourness
and
a
bit
more
complex
as
well
my
favorite
sour
to
date
o
a
fantastic
sour
but
then
again
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
else
from
russian
river
o
definitely
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
and
was
glad
to
revisit
this
monster
again
another
rr
success
overall
really
pleasant
sour
easily
the
best
from
rr
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
american
wilds
out
there
compared
to
a
true
belgian
lambic
though
its
not
up
with
the
best
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
and
definitely
missing
the
funk
that
i
crave
im
being
picky
though
this
is
delicious
and
a
worthy
celebration
beer
awesome
beer
this
has
actually
turned
me
on
to
sours
o
delicious
beer
that
borders
on
a
gueuze
imo
if
the
funk
wasnt
so
restrained
in
the
backbround
id
say
this
wasnt
a
wild
ale
but
very
good
none
the
less
enjoyed
a
bottle
at
the
brewery
pours
a
golden
clear
yellow
tastes
very
sour
with
notes
of
apples
and
other
fruits
a
little
lemony
as
well
this
makes
your
mouth
pucker
really
good
stuff
this
brewerys
wild
ales
are
rocking
my
world
i
might
have
to
see
if
try
have
another
bottle
before
leaving
town
o
the
hype
is
well
deserved
grab
as
many
as
you
can
while
you
can
easily
my
favorite
of
all
the
russian
river
sours
ive
sampled
to
date
this
one
has
a
very
bright
citrusy
profile
i
love
hands
down
one
sour
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
could
beautiful
complex
this
has
some
flavors
ive
never
had
in
a
sour
beer
cherry
strawberry
that
ive
enjoyed
i
want
to
try
it
again
and
again
to
pick
out
the
other
flavors
hidden
inside
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
lively
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
not
over
done
it
is
light
and
lively
in
the
feel
with
a
brutal
dryness
and
acidity
to
it
this
is
really
a
fantastic
brew
that
nearly
borders
on
being
too
much
i
have
waiting
a
very
long
time
to
try
this
and
it
has
met
my
expectations
quite
well
the
nose
on
this
is
unreal
and
while
the
flavor
is
deep
and
complex
it
is
a
harsh
bugger
that
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
i
guess
this
goes
without
saying
wild
ale
fans
this
is
a
musttry
my
first
experience
of
the
sonambic
awesome
interesting
beer
not
complex
but
an
impressive
showcase
of
the
flavors
it
does
have
i
imagine
it
being
served
ice
cold
accompanying
some
delicious
fresh
seafood
out
of
that
context
maybe
its
more
of
a
curiosity
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
fantastic
sour
oak
funk
and
citrus
all
blend
fantastically
the
oak
really
stands
out
and
it
has
the
funk
smell
of
a
belgian
lambic
much
more
than
your
average
american
wild
flavor
is
very
sour
and
acidic
initially
but
is
very
complex
theres
a
great
amount
of
oak
and
funkiness
to
this
as
well
and
it
has
some
qualities
that
remind
me
of
drie
fonteinen
oude
gueuze
it
comes
off
somewhere
between
a
wild
and
a
gueuze
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
coats
your
mouth
very
nicely
overall
this
is
really
a
fantastic
american
wild
that
may
come
closest
to
the
belgian
style
its
modeled
after
of
any
american
beer
ive
had
im
a
big
fan
and
glad
to
have
finally
gotten
a
chance
to
try
this
after
all
this
time
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
amazing
sour
probably
my
favorite
rr
beer
to
date
all
batches
of
this
were
very
good
btu
batch
3
is
unreal
right
now
highly
recommended
definitely
looking
for
more
bottles
of
this
one
overall
this
a
phenomenal
wild
i
would
describe
the
experience
as
an
erection
for
the
taste
buds
o
another
amazing
russian
river
wild
ale
as
if
there
was
any
doubt
while
supplication
remains
my
favorite
this
was
the
one
i
was
most
excited
to
try
and
it
certainly
met
my
expectations
bottle
of
b5
poured
into
tion
glass
the
pour
is
hazy
yellow
with
fizzy
appearance
minimal
head
present
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
heavenly
notes
of
lactic
acid
pair
with
candied
tangerine
tart
cherries
waves
of
oak
and
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
quite
a
journey
starting
with
candied
fruits
mainly
citrus
a
bit
of
oak
and
funk
comes
through
next
as
things
quickly
head
towards
the
intensely
sour
side
of
the
spectrum
the
finish
leaves
a
lingering
tartness
on
the
tongue
which
leaves
you
hanging
for
the
next
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
effevescent
and
the
body
is
light
overall
this
is
not
only
a
very
approachable
sour
with
great
balance
but
it
is
damn
tastey
and
well
rounded
the
hype
train
surrounds
this
one
for
a
reason
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
sour
beers
o
what
a
true
delight
this
beer
has
made
me
so
happy
i
just
cant
explain
it
i
will
savor
it
every
chance
i
get
oa
wonderful
beer
spot
on
with
the
sour
and
it
meshes
excellently
with
the
lemon
and
grassy
notes
o
very
good
way
different
than
the
wild
ales
ive
had
before
overall
this
was
pure
awesomeness
my
favorite
sour
from
rr
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
i
cant
to
see
what
some
more
age
does
to
these
beasts
this
truly
has
sour
power
perhaps
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
ive
had
but
wait
it
has
balance
too
right
off
the
bat
lactic
sourness
hits
you
then
a
very
grungy
earthy
quality
to
the
taste
with
grass
and
hay
citrus
and
lemon
lift
more
sour
the
finish
is
puckering
lots
of
that
russian
river
pedigree
from
there
great
oak
barrels
i
suppose
we
could
call
that
terrior
scrubbing
bubbles
sourness
dry
lingering
lactic
finish
just
amazing
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
had
that
is
worth
the
hype
nough
said
im
not
sure
its
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
but
its
definitely
a
great
one
and
something
unlike
most
american
wild
ales
perfect
sourness
level
the
underlying
components
still
shine
through
and
create
a
great
experience
very
excited
to
have
a
few
more
to
age
verdict
my
words
dont
do
this
beer
justice
its
truly
unbelievable
and
the
hype
and
hysteria
is
most
certainly
deserved
this
is
quite
possibly
russian
rivers
best
sour
offering
and
with
an
already
impressive
lineup
of
sour
beer
it
really
is
saying
something
whether
you
call
it
a
gueuze
or
an
american
wild
ale
this
is
a
must
try
at
all
costs
for
any
sour
lover
beatification
is
a
gueuze
treading
the
same
path
as
cantillon
drie
fonteinen
yet
vinnie
and
the
russian
river
crew
demonstrate
their
own
masterful
americanized
interpretation
of
the
style
with
this
brew
a
landmark
american
sour
showcasing
whats
possible
in
the
style
when
you
combine
creativity
with
worldclass
brewing
blending
talent
balls
in
your
court
belgium
after
the
yeast
more
musty
notes
emerge
more
basement
and
less
farm
pungent
and
potent
as
all
hell
white
pepper
notes
emerge
grapefruit
skin
white
grape
skin
and
tannin
assloads
of
tannic
wood
still
acidic
but
a
tad
more
lush
and
creamy
dusty
and
gravely
outfreakingstanding
thanks
mark
o
extremely
drinkable
i
compared
this
sidebyside
with
sanctification
and
found
it
much
more
complex
sour
and
balanced
slightly
disappointing
since
i
can
find
sanctification
much
more
easily
i
guess
you
really
need
to
let
nature
do
its
work
without
intervening
to
create
a
thing
of
beauty
get
it
if
and
while
you
can
phenomenal
easily
the
best
american
wild
ale
ive
had
topping
even
cable
car
o
an
excellent
beer
almost
as
good
as
american
sour
beers
get
however
at
the
price
point
even
directly
from
rr
which
only
offers
375
ml
bottles
its
not
worth
quite
the
hype
that
it
gets
just
keep
in
mind
that
if
you
can
find
them
cantillon
and
3f
gueuzes
are
actually
cheaper
per
volume
heck
a
cuvee
renee
is
13
the
price
and
is
comparable
quality
though
some
may
disagree
if
you
get
the
chance
try
this
beer
just
dont
lose
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
it
it
is
not
a
spiritual
experience
o
usually
i
dont
find
myself
wanting
much
more
than
1012oz
of
most
sours
but
i
could
have
sapped
back
on
3
of
these
easily
so
refreshing
so
crisp
so
clean
and
such
a
nice
bone
drying
finish
that
kept
me
wanting
more
im
told
and
assuming
age
will
make
this
beer
better
as
it
usually
does
this
style
but
i
really
couldnt
imagine
where
it
could
have
improved
or
how
it
could
have
been
better
admittedly
im
not
new
to
the
style
but
new
to
appreciating
it
and
finally
feeling
confident
in
my
ability
to
critique
or
review
sours
properly
great
freaking
stuff
o
i
drank
my
second
of
my
six
bottles
i
acquired
yesterday
at
rr
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
plan
on
getting
it
as
often
as
i
can
poured
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
cloudy
strawcolored
body
and
the
head
dissipated
quickly
with
no
lacing
on
the
glass
smelled
sour
vinegery
brett
all
throughout
the
intense
aroma
some
citus
as
well
tasted
as
i
expected
from
the
smell
citrusy
sour
and
tangy
excellent
flavor
that
lingers
for
a
while
lots
of
zip
in
the
mouthfeel
fairly
lightweight
and
very
fitting
for
the
taste
overall
an
excellent
wild
ale
but
extremely
sour
so
definitely
not
for
everyone
gotta
grab
a
few
bottles
to
take
home
thanks
again

cheers
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
appearance
was
just
like
the
other
batches
ive
tried
a
murky
orange
smell
was
super
sour
and
tart
in
the
nose
with
some
floral
kicks
to
it
taste
was
also
extremely
sour
and
sweet
tart
with
some
floral
notes
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
feel
to
it
not
prickly
but
close
to
it
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
very
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
for
such
a
sour
beer
i
found
that
i
liked
this
batch
better
than
batch
4
but
not
as
much
as
batch
5

o
this

is

definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
making
a
point
to
try
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
batches
at
some
point
in
the
future
and
am
stoked
that
vinnie
co
at
russian
river
are
continuing
to
produce
this
beer
o
amazing
beer
very
impressed
love
the
acidity
vinegar
sour
apple
easy
drinkability
puckering
one
of
if
not
the
best
sour
i
have
ever
had
batch
4
so
glad
im
finally
getting
to
try
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
gold
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
goes
down
quickly
scent
is
funky
with
nice
lemon
aromas
there
is
also
a
bit
of
sweat
aroma
in
the
nose
as
well
lovely
wild
yeast
scents
and
citrus
with
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
taste
is
very
oaky
at
first
with
intense
lemon
and
sharp
bitter
funk
from
the
wild
yeast
a
bit
of
cheese
as
well
nice
blend
of
lemon
funk
and
sour
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
puckering
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
rr
has
yet
to
disappoint
im
not
regretting
waiting
in
line
for
3
hours
for
a
few
bottles
of
this
overall
a
tasty
sour
well
done
very
drinkable
o
one
of
the
toughest
rr
sours
to
track
down
but
definitely
worth
it
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
tart
and
sourness
though
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
saying
this
is
drinkable
it
is
definitely
enjoyable
but
should
be
savored
good
stuff
less
complex
and
funky
than
its
predecessors
but
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
it
does
with
age
4
5
ph1
this
is
a
completely
different
beer
the
nose
is
sweet
and
floral
with
lots
of
honey
caramel
pear
lilac
and
cinnamon
on
the
palate
its
a
bit
overcarbonated
exploding
into
bubbles
that
make
the
brew
hard
to
taste
same
in
the
flavor
though
lilac
honey
caramel
pear
compared
to
later
beatifications
this
is
lighter
more
delicate
sweeter
and
more
floral
with
none
of
the
aggressive
tartness
of
the
others
i
like
how
different
it
is
redemption
is
the
base
beer
here
which
makes
sense
o
this
is
definitely
one
amazing
beer
it
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
had
so
far
o
wonderful
beer
im
thankful
that
i
was
able
to
get
a
couple
of
bottles
o
so
glad
to
have
checked
this
one
off
i
will
be
glad
to
try
this
again
when
the
new
batch
comes
out
great
sour
beer
well
done
rr
while
this
is
very
good
i
still
think
supplication
is
my
favorite
of
their
lineup
like
batch
2
this
is
pretty
hugely
sour
but
not
as
intensely
so
prominently
lactic
with
some
lime
rind
and
citrusy
acidity
as
well
mild
tannins
and
the
lactic
acid
really
brings
to
mind
unripened
stone
fruit
yellow
freestone
peaches
nectarines
the
funk
level
is
tempered
by
the
sourness
but
grass
and
straw
are
quite
prominent
mildly
cheesy
as
well
drying
on
the
finish
with
lingering
lactic
acid
some
oak
tannins
that
lend
a
chewiness
this
beer
is
crisply
carbonated
highly
sour
this
is
pretty
excellent

overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
puckering
and
blistering
sour
wilds
i
have
had
i
absolutely
love
it
it
reminds
me
of
an
incredibly
tart
gueuze
o
just
crazy
good
this
could
be
the
best
american
wild
gueuzelike
so
pleased
to
have
tried
overall
the
highlight
of
this
crazy
day
for
me
after
having
so
many
good
beers
read
ba
cuir
zwanze
2011
lou
pepe
kriek
007
pvw
eclipse
ba
decedance
and
blåbær
this
was
the
stand
out
while
007
was
somewhat
similar
it
was
more
balanced
this
was
just
a
in
your
face
mouth
puckering
sour
i
was
hoping
i
would
hate
this
so
i
didnt
have
to
try
and
find
more
but
alas
that
was
not
the
case
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
of
this
thanks
again
so
much
to
alex
for
sharing
this
one
of
the
most
complex
american
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
pineapple
lemon
juice
brett
lactic
acid
no
real
oak
flavor
deep
fruit
notes
combine
with
a
complex
sourness
up
there
with
the
best
belgian
lambics
as
far
as
im
concerned
cant
put
it
into
words
just
fantastic
color
is
golden
and
murky
with
no
head
smell
is
surprisingly
clean
with
vague
fruit
notes
and
some
minor
funk
taste
is
intensely
sour
and
puckering
with
some
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
onedimensional
in
that
the
sourness
is
the
overwhelming
characteristic
though
still
very
pleasant
body
is
light
i
enjoyed
this
though
there
isnt
that
much
to
say
perhaps
the
most
sour
beer
ive
had
leathery
brett
tinged
witha
sharp
lemon
acidity
not
an
overly
powering
acidity
i
think
its
fairly
well
balanced
between
the
sourness
and
funk
for
an
american
wild
clean
flavor
profile
bitter
drying
brett
aftertaste
not
a
lasting
sourness
cleans
off
the
palate
fairly
quickly
this
one
pours
a
light
to
medium
bodied
melted
butter
in
appearance
with
a
light
white
lacing
it
smells
of
light
granny
smith
apples
with
some
apricot
and
peaches
this
is
officially
the
first
beer
to
make
me
pucker
wow
this
is
mind
blowingly
sour
it
is
just
so
tart
and
you
dont
get
killed
with
brett
its
really
astonishing
what
a
sour
as
far
as
sours
go
this
is
a
sipper
an
utter
palate
destroyer
phenomenal
phenomenal
beer
will
add
in
my
thoughts
on
batch
002
when
i
get
around
to
opening
my
last
bottle
highly
recommended
stuff
im
anxiously
looking
forward
to
batch
004
wish
this
still
came
in
750mls
batch
2
the
brew
pours
a
hazy
yellow
hue
and
is
topped
with
some
wispy
bubbles
just
enough
head
to
demonstrate
liveliness
the
nose
is
whew
musky
and
hugely
atomized
it
is
getting
into
my
sinuses
like
vernors
ginger
ale
does
strange
observation
i
know
anyhow
the
aroma
is
musky
and
lemonzesty
and
just
very
pert
allaround
the
taste
is
just
absolutely
fantastic
it
is
the
sourest
a
thing
can
be
without
crossing
the
line
into
a
flagrant
level
notes
of
lemon
green
apple
wet
wood
overripe
peaches
or
maybe
underripe
wet
dog
warhead
candy
and
a
small
amount
of
tart
white
grape
reveal
tremendous
complexity
within
the
sourness
the
feel
is
pert
for
the
most
part
but
it
has
an
amazingly
clean
finish
having
had
batch
2
and
3
i
must
say
i
prefer
2
it
is
far
more
sour
disparately
flavored
and
heavily
nuanced
whereas
i
recollect
3
to
be
far
more
harmonious
juicy
and
less
tart
overall
one
of
the
better
american
wilds
ive
ever
had
this
beer
pours
out
a
beautiful
hazy
blonde
with
hints
of
amber
the
head
is
almost
nonexistent
with
a
thin
ring
around
the
edges
the
smell
puts
off
a
big
oaky
character
with
hints
of
funky
fruit
hinting
toward
apricot
the
main
thing
i
get
out
of
this
is
a
big
dry
oaky
tingle
the
citrus
acidity
on
the
backside
to
this
beer
is
incredible
the
back
of
my
tongue
and
cheeks
are
pulled
so
tight
this
is
what
ill
expect
from
a
sour
from
now
on
the
finish
on
this
beer
lasts
forever
i
cant
believe
how
incredible
this
beer
is
a
life
goal
has
been
fulfilled
thank
you
again
jeff
and
chad
for
sharing
this
moment
with
me
o
holy
cow
this
was
delicious
i
love
sour
and
this
was
hands
down
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
stuff
was
great
so
many
great
aspects
to
this
beer
wish
i
had
more
an
acidic
and
ultra
aggressive
yet
tasteful
citrus
flavor
with
a
mild
cheesy
funk
however
the
aroma
of
citrus
and
barnyard
is
definitely
understated
compared
to
the
flavor
of
this
beer
an
absolutely
mind
numbing
sour
ale
from
russian
river
probably
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
cant
wait
to
try
other
batches
of
this
one
edit
lots
can
change
in
9
months
had
b005
several
times
recently
and
it
is
crazy
good
edited
well
up
to
reflect
this
o
really
great
beer
not
sure
how
much
this
varies
batch
to
batch
but
this
was
a
big
time
winner
and
awesome
example
of
an
american
wild
really
no
complaints
with
this
one
would
love
to
drink
it
regularly
omore
friendly
and
approachable
than
fresh
bottles
a
few
years
does
this
beer
a
world
of
good
though
i
am
a
big
fan
of
it
fresh
as
well
smells
funky
with
tons
of
lemon
tastes
very
very
tartsour
the
oak
is
great
on
the
tongue
the
sourness
burns
the
throat
wow
this
is
potent
overall
the
aroma
is
phenomenal
but
the
sourness
hurts
me
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
batch
003
i
have
been
lucky
as
of
late
to
knock
out
quite
a
few
of
my
brews
needed
for
my
russian
river
tion
quest
and
this
one
is
no
exception
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
sour
tart
funk
and
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
nothing
short
of
excellent
in
all
aspects
this
one
was
a
standout
from
the
tasting
that
night
for
just
about
all
of
the
participants
the
flavor
on
this
one
was
otherworldly
sour
and
definitely
brought
the
duckface
hard
even
from
the
aroma
you
would
get
a
partial
duckface
going
definitely
well
rounded
in
flavor
though
as
the
fruit
and
woodiness
added
a
nice
touch
to
keep
your
palate
guessing
rather
than
just
dropkicking
it
with
sour
and
tart
notes
really
really
well
done
hope
to
try
some
older
batches
in
the
future
for
comparison
hint
hint
traders
o
glad
i
had
some
people
to
share
this
with
i
like
it
but
its
intense
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
minimal
head
that
disappears
quickly
funky
sour
bretty
aroma
lemon
acidity
with
a
little
sour
apple
very
pleasant
sour
taste
despite
the
high
acidity
mild
carbonation
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
american
geuzestyles
this
one
and
duck
duck
geuze
are
in
a
class
of
their
own
overall
very
sour
and
acidic
hard
to
drink
but
great
flavors
and
light
funk
o
batch
3
was
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
and
now
this
one
has
taken
that
over
this
is
a
beer
that
could
age
forever
and
just
get
better
cant
wait
to
open
another
this
beer
is
the
most
sour
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
this
is
the
only
thing
i
will
talk
about
because
of
how
sour
it
was
it
was
like
i
took
everything
i
knew
about
sour
beers
and
blew
my
entire
mind
beatification
made
me
literally
lose
all
thought
as
i
took
a
drink
it
shocked
me
that
much
at
the
same
time
this
might
be
its
downfall
there
would
be
no
way
that
i
could
get
this
beer
down
on
my
own
or
even
between
two
people
it
is
so
sour
excellent
taste
great
beer
batch

one
of
the
best
wild
ales
out
there
at
least
in
my
experience
the
gueuze
comparisons
are
inevitable
though
this
is
less
balanced
and
more
overtly
tart
and
less
funky
than
befits
that
style
so
clean
and
sharp
though
not
without
its
rawness
a
treat
and
one
of
the
bars
for
the
style
i
think
the
beauty
of
this
beer
is
really
in
the
details
tasting
a
lambic
style
beer
known
to
be
fermented
and
conditioned
with
yeast
and
bacteria
native
to
a
region
other
than
the
senne
valley
that
is
so
complex
and
delicious
is
inspiring
the
impact
of
this
beer
is
an
illustration
that
although
a
true
lambic
cannot
be
produced
elsewhere
a
complex
balanced
and
truly
interesting
top
shelf
product
can
be
made
in
other
regions
and
shows
the
true
potential
of
the
american
wild
movement
i
believe
that
an
increased
interest
in
this
beer
could
be
a
key
contributor
to
the
increased
legitimacy
of
beer
as
a
gourmet
product
nice
work
russian
river
keep
doing
more
of
the
same
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
chris
busted
it
out
to
help
ease
the
pain
of
the
hawks
loss
thanks
batch
3
poured
into
lost
abbey
tumbler
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
tiny
white
head
fades
to
a
collar
smells
musty
and
lemony
sour
not
sweet
at
all
some
white
grapes
very
funky
taste
is
incredibly
sour
and
lactic
slightly
metallic
citric
very
acidic
funky
barnyard
how
many
ways
can
i
say
sour
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
american
wild
intensely
sour
this
reminds
me
more
of
some
of
the
great
belgians
then
any
american
sour
i
have
had
on
tap
at
the
public
house
in
san
francisco
pours
a
clear
amber
with
with
a
small
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
bunch
of
small
spots
of
lacing
on
glass
aroma
is
very
funky
with
big
grapefruit
and
a
mineral
presence
also
a
big
of
oak
and
some
champagne
yeast
initial
taste
is
huge
tart
grapefruit
which
goes
into
some
lemon
and
mineral
some
light
oak
as
well
very
dry
and
very
sour
one
of
the
most
sour
beer
i
have
had
mild
astringency
lightmedium
body
medium
carbonation
right
up
there
with
the
best
beers
that
russian
river
or
anyone
else
has
to
offer
this
beer
is
crazy
sour
but
not
in
a
way
that
is
over
the
top
it
is
really
hard
to
explain
all
i
can
say
is
that
for
how
sour
it
is
it
is
extremely
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
has
turned
into
a
beast
with
some
age
on
it
nice
complexity
in
the
nose
and
flavor
plus
lots
sourness
a
sourheads
dream
for
sure
that
being
said
the
level
of
sourness
does
cut
down
on
the
drinkability
somewhat
but
at
the
same
time
makes
the
beer
fun
to
drink
ill
definitely
have
to
seek
out
batch
003
now
that
ive
had
this
highly
recommended
i
am
very
fond
of
this
beer
probably
the
best
american
wild
ive
had
to
date
batch
3this
is
also
very
solid
would
get
a
slightly
lower
rating
it
has
the
same
complex
funk
to
it
that
batch
2
had
it
has
slightly
more
acidity
but
still
has
the
same
assertive
sourness
it
also
doesnt
have
the
bright
golden
fruit
presence
that
batch
2
has
it
is
there
but
not
quite
as
vibrant
integrated
well
but
slightly
less
complex
d
the
drinkability
isnt
that
huge
because
of
the
unrelenting
citrus
vinegar
and
funk
notes
but
i
just
cannot
stop
drinking
this
this
beer
was
an
experience
for
me
and
i
cannot
wait
to
try
it
again
the
cpj
d
man
on
man
why
didnt
i
buy
more
of
this
easily
one
of
the
best
wild
ales
ive
ever
had
just
fantastic
i
cant
wait
for
another
batch
light
and
crisp
with
good
small
bubble
carbonation
that
gently
tickles
your
tongue
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
hands
down
the
best
american
wild
ale
that
resembles
the
belgian
gueuze
amazing
flavor
and
complexity
other
sour
brewers
take
note
d
such
great
drinkability
this
one
goes
down
so
well
its
hard
to
keep
any
in
the
glass
while
reviewing
also
difficult
in
terms
of
its
rarity
thanks
for
the
top
100
tick
sweem
the
appearance
is
a
thick
murky
orange
with
no
head
it
doesnt
look
pretty
but
in
all
honesty
it
reminds
me
of
raspberry
eisbock
flat
thick
and
old
looking
the
smell
is
about
as
interesting
as
it
gets
for
any
beer
the
most
complex
and
outright
strange
beer
ive
ever
smelled
i
get
musty
basement
barn
horse
smelly
feet
aged
white
cheddar
energy
drink
such
as
monster
or
red
bull
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
white
grapes
in
the
finish
wow
the
taste
is
sour
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
the
sourness
hurts
my
epiglottis
puckers
my
posterior
pharynx
makes
my
face
warm
and
causes
me
to
tear
up
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
almost
zero
but
the
taste
and
smell
of
it
is
so
unique
that
this
beer
truly
does
live
up
to
the
hype
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
tonight
thus
far
as
someone
who
loves
midwestern
stouts
and
ipas
ive
always
been
a
big
basher
of
west
coat
sours
however
beatification
is
as
good
as
it
gets
touche
d
well
i
only
had
about
6
ounces
of
this
and
wish
i
could
have
had
more
with
that
being
said
the
extreme
sourness
of
this
beer
would
probably
limit
my
ability
to
have
a
lot
of
this
in
one
sitting
with
that
being
said
id
be
happy
to
have
this
at
any
opportunity
and
will
definitely
look
to
get
more
wonderful
experience
d
i
find
batch
3
much
more
drinkable
and
i
should
probably
review
it
formally
batch
2
is
ok
in
small
doses
but
it
strikes
me
as
straight
lemon
juice
this
is
my
top
sour
either
batch
i
would
drink
these
constantly
this
is
easily
one
of
the
top
sours
in
the
world
d
this
is
pretty
much
as
good
as
it
gets
and
im
floored
by
how
close
to
perfection
is
seems
to
be
to
my
tastes
suddenly
pennsylvania
doesnt
seem
too
far
to
travel
to
try
to
secure
more
im
fortunate
its
on
the
east
at
all
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
puckering
tart
mouthfeel
soft
carbonation
with
some
earthy
oak
notes
as
well
as
some
puckering
sour
funk
the
great
thing
about
this
beer
is
although
it
is
sour
and
funky
with
dry
bretty
efervescence
it
isnt
acetic
at
all
and
is
actually
very
well
balanced
by
the
citrus
and
light
fruit
notes
hints
of
lemon
peel
as
well
as
apple
and
pear
complex
and
extremely
complex
with
a
nice
tart
finish
each
sip
leaves
me
salivating
for
more
get
this
beer
d
it
was
wonderfully
drinkable
but
one
i
really
wanted
to
savor
i
got
about
a
6oz
pour
of
it
which
was
perfect
its
one
i
would
definitely
drink
again
and
again
since
the
original
rate
ive
recently
had
the
batch
2
and
batch
3
side
by
side
its
a
wonderful
beer
especially
batch
2
i
dont
know
whether
the
beer
has
matured
in
the
last
year
or
ive
just
grown
to
like
it
more
its
clearly
in
another
league
from
lost
abbey
light
sours
even
the
big
name
ones
and
is
better
than
most
available
geuze
around
here
overall
phenomenal
beer
ill
be
honest
i
am
a
big
fan
of
russian
river
kind
of
makes
it
hard
living
in
new
york
and
this
bottle
does
not
disappoint
i
am
enjoying
it
very
much
and
my
bottle
was
signed
by
vinnie
at
a
fest
some
time
ago
irrelevant
for
the
taste
but
still
fun
to
mention
d
im
very
grateful
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
i
will
certainly
be
looking
to
get
more
when
the
next
batch
is
released
but
this
is
some
pretty
strong
stuff
flavor
wise
one
glass
in
a
sitting
was
more
than
enough
for
me
all
in
all
im
amazed
what
a
beer
i
love
rrs
regular
sour
offerings
but
this
takes
the
cake
only
sanctification
comes
close
to
the
levels
of
funkiness
in
this
i
hope
to
try
every
batch
of
this
but
ill
always
remember
2
fondly
d
overall
a
nice
wild
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
tick
this
bad
boy
d
a
hardcore
sipper
partially
to
blame
is
its
incredible
sourness
deliciousness
and
complexity
one
of
those
beers
that
just
amazes
me
that
naturally
occurring
things
can
cause
flavors
like
this
all
on
their
own
sourswilds
really
propelled
me
to
the
next
level
in
beer
advocacy
and
this
point
is
one
of
its
peaks
im
running
out
of
creative
and
artistic
ways
to
describe
this
simply
amazing
d
a
new
experience
with
beer
for
me
definitely
opened
up
my
eyes
even
further
just
when
i
think
beer
cant
impress
me
any
further
it
continues
to
do
so
this
having
been
my
second
time
trying
it
i
really
do
think
it
deserves
the
updated
score
i
am
giving
it
rareness
and
demand
aside
this
is
really
world
class
in
every
way
makes
me
want
to
try
some
of
the
older
batches
to
compare
with
this
but
i
doubt
that
will
ever
happen
russian
river
needs
to
release
a
new
batch
of
this
asap
bottle
pours
a
slightly
haze
straw
color
with
a
slight
collared
white
head
lemon
zesty
nose
coupled
with
some
barnyard
very
citrus
type
tart
notes
light
mouhfeel
with
good
carbonation
slightly
mouth
puckering
the
taste
is
really
good
with
notes
of
oak
barnyard
lemon
grapefruit
and
white
grapes
some
good
brett
notes
without
being
overly
floral
or
medicinal
tasty
very
tasty
overall
ends
pretty
dryly
excellent
representation
of
the
style
this
may
be
my
absolute
favorite
american
wild
ale
d
the
best
barrelaged
russian
river
beer
ive
ever
had
one
of
the
best
wild
ales
ive
ever
had
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
oh
man
was
this
tasty
i
wish
i
had
more
o
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
age
has
certainly
been
kind
to
it
would
love
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
flavor
is
just
like
the
aroma
perfect
this
turned
out
to
be
my
favoritebiggest
surprise
beer
of
the
nightwhich
had
beers
like
black
tuesday
and
duck
duck
gooze
to
compete
with
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
delightful
but
didnt
expect
it
to
rock
my
world
the
sournesstartness
is
incredible
loads
of
the
sharp
tart
oak
funkiness
finishes
only
slightly
dry
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
what
a
fantastic
sour
aroma
is
just
a
great
combination
of
funk
and
the
characteristic
grapefruit
flavor
that
this
beer
is
often
known
for
i
like
that
the
funk
character
is
complex
and
satisfying
without
going
into
the
cheesy
direction
dont
get
my
wrong
theres
a
time
and
a
place
for
some
stinky
cheese
aroma
its
just
nice
to
find
a
great
complex
nose
that
satisfies
without
it
im
mostly
getting
some
musty
strawlike
components
wet
wood
and
bretty
earthiness
in
the
funk
department
which
is
just
awesome
contrasting
with
the
brighter
grapefruit
and
meyer
lemon
acidic
qualities
the
taste
is
just
as
delicious
as
the
aroma
prefaced
boasting
sharp
lactic
sourness
all
of
the
great
lemony
and
grapefruit
brightening
up
the
palate
with
lowmedium
bodied
with
lively
yet
subtle
carbonation
aiding
in
the
long
dry
earthy
mineral
finish
not
as
tonguenumbingly
sour
as
batch
2
but
still
packs
a
punch
one
of
the
best
american
sour
beers
always
a
pleasure
to
drink
one
of
the
closer
american
examples
to
traditional
lambic
there
were
some
similarities
here
and
there
to
cantillon
classic
gueuze
another
all
time
favorite
of
mine
the
only
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
you
have
to
try
it
youll
either
love
it
or
hate
it
but
i
think
it
is
beatifying
indeed
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
too
carbonated
like
some
american
wilds
sticky
and
dry
finish
because
of
the
oak
and
sourness
really
nice
but
nothing
world
class
like
the
taste
this
beer
is
super
sour
not
cantillon
kriek
razors
down
the
throat
sour
but
really
puckering
this
beer
rocks
plain
and
simple
i
have
a
batch
3
750ml
bottle
to
open
sometime
down
the
line
and
i
cant
wait
highly
highly
recommended
for
the
sour
connoisseur
or
any
beer
lover
this
stuff
is
amazing
and
may
be
a
permanent
iso
for
me
d
i
would
drink
this
every
day
if
it
were
feasible
wow
d
perfect
my
favorite
out
of
all
the
sours
we
consumed
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
date
overall
nice
brew
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
anytime
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
just
a
touch
lower
due
to
the
extreme
sourness
of
the
brew
overall
i
really
liked
what
rr
did
here
out
of
all
the
sours
we
tasted
this
one
came
in
at
2
skal
thanks
to
jedwards
for
sharing
375ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
batch

poured
a

with
no

reveals
some
citrus
perhaps
tangerines
cork
and
a
hint
of
funk
taste
reveals
muted
grapefruit
seeds
and
a
salty
quality
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
with
an
easy
carbonation
and
some
light
astringency
that
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
what
an
incredible
sour
light
flavorful
and
extremely
drinkable
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
drinkability
i
first
had
001
ph1
on
72509
in
a
full
beatification
vertical
001
001
ph1
002
003
and
i
couldnt
decide
if
002
or
ph1
was
the
best
batch
i
had
ph1
again
at
woodshop
5
0
on
2202010
and
it
was
a
disgusting
mess
so
i
was
worried
the
whole
batch
had
gone
downhill
this
most
recent
bottle
was
sublime
so
i
really
have
no
idea
what
the
deal
was
with
the
bottle
at
woodshop
there
were
no
detectable
off
flavors
here
it
was
a
display
of
all
around
excellence
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
smell
is
very
funky
like
cheese
sour
lemons
apples
and
oak
taste
is
sour
lemons
pears
apples
funk
and
oak
medium
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
overall
it
is
another
great
sour
batch
003
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
much
more
funky
than
the
other
russian
river
sours
i
have
rated
i
get
some
cheesy
funk
a
little
tartness
and
some
oak
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
cheesy
funk
with
some
tart
lemons
and
oak
character
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
might
be
the
most
genuine
american
sour
ale
ive
come
across
very
lambiclike
in
terms
of
sourness
and
overall
character
d
a
very
solid
beer
and
in
my
opinion
the
best
of
the
tion
series
next
to
supplication
clean
and
crisp
with
a
taste
that
isnt
overly
complex
but
still
very
well
executed
thanks
again
to
jeff
for
the
opportunity
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
with
perhaps
even
a
little
more
time
on
it
overall
yet
another
fantastic
sour
from
russian
river
as
i
said
probably
my
current
favorite
from
their
lineup
d
its
good
but
one
glass
is
enough
for
me
typical
funk
smell
taste
is
some
citrus
with
lambic
taste
like
actual
lambicguezue
taste
i
believe
i
can
taste
oak
as
well
consumed

ever
a

by

a
wild

that
is
100

super

it

beer
reminiscent
of
isabelle
proximus
a
one
note
incredibly
sour
beer
overall
an
amazing
beer
that
everyone
should
seek
out
its
gotten
pretty
tart
over
the
course
of
a
year
or
so
so
if
you
want
to
age
some
be
known
that
this
is
what
it
does
dthis
batch
is
ridiculously
good
so
clean
and
tart
i
have
had
both
batch
2
and
3
a
few
times
and
i
have
to
say
batch
2
maybe
a
little
more
tart
than
batch
3
although
any
version
of
this
beer
is
simply
outstanding
drinkability
by
far
the
best
lightcolored
sour
ive
had
complex
intense
and
tangy
the
high
sourness
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
damn
i
still
cant
get
over
that
smell
highly
highly
recommended
overall
this
beer
was
a
true
experience
and
a
great
leap
for
me
into
sours
wellcrafted
from
a
unique
brewery
and
certainly
one
i
would
like
to
revisit
in
the
future
it
poured
a
nice
lite
yellow
an
off
gold
heather
straw
color
with
a
mighty
funk
odor
presiding
from
the
glass
this
beer
was
super
tart
and
super
dry
with
a
strong
citric
taste
there
was
also
a
very
bretty
taste
the
taste
was
very
malleable
varying
from
sip
to
sip
jumping
from
the
barnyard
brett
to
a
bone
dry
lemon
making
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
that
combined
with
the
low
abv
lack
of
sweetness
and
the
pleasant
fuzziness
i
could
have
drunken
this
all
day
yet
this
review
still
comes
out
a
bit
drunk
go
figure
beer
is
a
sour
bomb
totally
citric
and
acetic
but
does
not
devolve
into
vinegar
as
some
of
these
lighter
bodied
ones
do
its
medium
to
low
in
body
the
carbonation
is
important
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
the
really
high
and
its
the
best
tasting
sour
ive
had
tartness
really
hits
me
in
the
corners
of
my
mouth
but
overall
a
great
and
solid
sour
im
shocked
its
not
rated
higher
ill
be
seeking
this
out
again
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
outstanding
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
with
a
mild
sourness
very
well
done
the
taste
is
awesome
as
hell
wow
what
a
great
sour
flavor
its
light
and
easy
drinking
with
a
mouthpuckering
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
wild
ale
its
no
secret
why
this
one
is
in
the
top
100
d
a
great
second
beer
needs
a
show
stater
too
much
and
too
intense
to
start
with
i
have
little
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
and
wild
time
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
in
750
format
i
think
a
little
goes
a
long
way
batch
002
brilliant
gold
in
color
with
a
light
amount
of
cloudiness
some
head
present
but
on
the
less
lustrous
side
of
things
aromas
is
citric
lemony
acidic
floral
and
vinous
the
spontaneous
inbarrel
fermentation
lends
a
more
powerful
sour
and
funk
than
russian
rivers
other
brews
the
taste
is
tongue
pleasingly
sour
with
citrus
lemon
pedio
funk
and
slightly
earthy
on
the
finish
moderately
bodied
with
a
matching
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
my
favorite
sour
from
russian
river
j
d
ive
always
been
a
huge
fan
of
the
intense
sourness
that
beatification
has
and
this
is
no
exception
i
always
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
open
up
a
bottle
this
has
to
be
the
most
balanced
sour
ive
had
the
beer
is
not
overly
sharp
in
the
finish
and
doesnt
have
a
huge
bite
its
just
a
solid
balanced
beer
very
nice
o
very
good
sour
this
beer
was
a
hit
for
the
night
with
wide
range
of
beers
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
few
bottles
to
monitor
how
this
beer
develops
with
age
overall
had
anticipated
more
out
of
this
beer
but
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
not
sure
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
but
worth
a
try
cheers
one
of
my
favorite
sours
from
russian
river
and
probably
one
of
their
least
accessible
for
those
new
to
the
style
a
little
goes
a
long
way
always
worth
seeking
out
drinks
very
easy
always
happy
to
try
anything
from
these
guys
i
think
i
prefer
these
heavier
darker
for
optimal
effect
none
of
the
rr
sours
are
slouches
though
if
you
like
bigtime
funk
sourness
this
is
your
huckleberry
russian
river
has
my
undying
respect
i
cannot
get
over
how
unfreakingbelievable
their
sours
are
also
have
a
signature
to
them
which
i
enjoy
i
feel
like
a
new
rr
sour
could
come
out
tomorrow
and
you
could
blindfold
me
stick
it
under
my
nose
and
i
would
recognize
it
immediately
d
a
very
easy
drinking
sour
that
is
very
enjoyable
and
mellow
in
terms
of
flavor
drinkability
is
amazing
i
cant
imagine
a
750
ml
going
faster
than
this
one
would
if
i
didnt
pace
myself
this
is
liquid
gold
in
a
bottle
i
was
thinking
about
trading
my
second
bottle
but
im
now
having
serious
doubts
and
second
thoughts
overall
i
am
very
impressed
i
would
consider
this
one
of
my
first
real
sour
beers
and
definitely
my
first
american
sour
i
can
definitely
see
why
these
rr
sours
are
so
sought
after
now
excellent
beer
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
this
beer
is
amazing
and
i
think
it
is
my
gateway
thanks
again
jeff
you
picked
a
fantastic
beer
to
send
me
the
mild
mouthfeel
and
general
feeling
of
elation
makes
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
the
aftertaste
might
be
off
putting
for
some
but
in
my
opinion
its
fantastic
making
for
my
favorite
russian
river
sour
offering
thus
far
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
for
how
sour
it
is
it
is
not
an
unpleasing
sour
and
allows
for
the
drinker
to
desire
more
i
would
not
have
more
than
1
glass
of
this
though
but
i
still
love
the
one
i
am
having
75cl
bottle
shared
by
photomike
just
another
animal
entirely
from
the
rest
of
the
russian
river
family
the
sourest
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
but
somehow
remained
smooth
and
drinkable
im
not
even
sure
that
i
understand
ever
since
hearing
vinnie
describe
how
they
were
brewing
this
beer
while
we
were
at
the
brewery
for
rbsg
this
past
summer
ive
been
dying
to
try
it
this
truly
is
a
sonambic
the
funk
the
acidity
the
wood
so
intense
from
start
to
finish
the
pour
is
a
relatively
unassuming
hazy
yellow
with
a
small
fine
head
that
leaves
patchy
lace
behind
the
aroma
is
where
things
get
interesting
its
just
the
funkiest
sourest
most
oaky
thing
to
ever
hit
my
nostrils
straight
oaked
lemon
juice
with
brett
the
flavor
is
super
dry
super
sour
with
yoghurt
and
lemons
coming
through
and
quite
oaky
though
relatively
clean
tasting
as
well
without
the
the
sharper
cheesy
funk
flavors
found
in
some
belgian
lambics
light
bodied
with
acid
coasting
the
tongue
i
had
burned
my
tongue
the
day
before
on
some
tea
and
beatification
started
to
bring
back
the
hurt
with
all
that
acid
pain
for
pleasure
honestly
this
borders
on
too
acidic
and
i
have
a
very
high
threshold
for
sour
though
it
is
very
well
blended
and
smooth
overall
for
how
acidic
it
is
this
might
not
have
been
the
most
pleasurable
beer
of
the
tasting
but
it
was
the
most
heavy
of
an
impact
lacks
the
depth
of
supplication
but
the
awesome
sourness
is
unrivaled
killer
shit
overall
maybe
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
though
not
super
complex
the
sour
dryness
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
over
and
over
despite
the
need
for
tums
overall
this
wild
ale
is
a
good
beer
partly
just
because
i
love
sours
however
compared
to
other
sours
it
is
severly
lacking
in
complexity
and
originality
would
i
drink
this
beer
again
certainly
would
i
go
out
of
my
to
find
it
trade
something
special
to
get
it
or
pay
a
lot
at
an
auction
site
no
overall
lots
of
brett
and
sour
character
fairly
one
dimensional
but
better
than
some
geueze
with
more
barnyardwild
character
o
great
refreshing
a
lot
of
nice
brett
character
complex
but
simple
md
crisp
light
feel
very
easy
drinking
mine
was
rather
well
carboanted
which
seems
to
be
abnormal
after
reading
other
reviews
i
can
smell
the
funk
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
cork
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
good
sized
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smells
of
barnyard
funk
lemon
tart
fruits
and
leather
smells
very
tart
i
think
im
in
for
a
treat
the
taste
is
mouth
puckering
sour
and
dry
with
lots
of
tart
fruits
especially
lemon
and
sour
orange
hints
of
horse
blanket
and
tobacco
round
it
out
leaves
a
bone
dry
finish
in
which
you
can
feel
the
lactic
acid
burn
down
your
throat
until
it
splashes
into
your
stomach
every
sip
leaves
your
mouth
watering
for
more
medium
low
carbonation
medium
light
body
wow
thats
a
great
sour
beer
lots
of
acid
some
funk
very
little
vinegar
vinnie
youve
done
it
again
good
beer
unfairly
i
was
expecting
some
kind
of
heavenly
notes
to
sound
when
i
opened
the
bottle
but
this
wasnt
as
good
as
some
other
sours
ive
had
good
but
simple
drinkability
is
great
balanced
acidity
great
depth
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
itll
be
neat
to
see
how
this
one
changes
with
some
age
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
but
not
terribly
balanced
and
missing
the
complexity
imparted
by
the
barrels
of
various
other
russian
river
sours
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
chance
but
its
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
medium
boby
is
delicately
carbonated
nice
dry
finish
another
very
impressive
sour
from
russian
river
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
a
little
over
the
top
with
tartness
so
not
something
you
could
sip
on
for
too
long
nice
flavors
and
interesting
qualities
good
sour
beer
would
like
to
see
more
flavor
just
kinda
bland
imho
dmmmm
mmm
damn
good
stuff
i
love
green
apples
and
this
is
that
in
fermented
form
the
wildness
is
fairly
subtle
and
does
its
best
to
accompany
the
flavours
and
not
overwhelm
them
drinkabiliy
is
superb
im
now
a
big
fan
i
love
sours
wilds
and
this
one
is
great
the
carbonation
and
dry
finish
combined
with
the
excellent
carbonation
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
barely
present
and
the
sour
notes
are
very
well
highlighted
d
possibly
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
the
light
body
coupled
with
the
5
5
abv
and
alluring
flavor
make
this
an
easy
one
to
enjoy
in
large
quantities
if
only
i
had
enough
to
session
with
batch

thanks
thorpe429
for
bringing
this
to
our
tasting
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
aromas
of
citrus
peach
sour
apples
and
a
nice
funk
with
light
vinegar
taste
is
quite
tart
with
more
lemon
flavors
and
horse
blanket
funkiness
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
style
a
bit
thin
though
this
is
a
very
complex
sour
and
one
of
my
favorites
also
surprisingly
it
went
very
well
with
our
supreme
pizza
d
exceedingly
drinkable
this
one
was
fantastic
and
hopefuly
ill
get
another
try
some
day
d
not
a
starter
sour
but
really
good
lots
of
funk
and
fruity
sourness
pretty
intense
but
excellent
sour
drinkability
the
tartness
of
this
beer
is
over
the
edge
for
me
although
i
understand
that
we
are
in
geuze
territory
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
bit
more
carbonation
as
well
d
not
my
favorite
wild
from
rr
but
damn
good
anyway
nb
probably
the
bottom
of
the
russian
river
wild
ales
but
still
better
than
most
overall
a
great
great
beer
a
sour
like
you
wouldnt
think
possible
in
a
beer
if
youve
never
had
a
sour
ale
before
like
myself
impressive
oak
and
some
wonderful
layers
of
barnyard
and
slight
bandaid
rubber
its
acidic
and
tart
with
the
malt
barely
to
be
seen
the
carbonation
is
not
quite
champagne
quality
but
its
tingly
and
satisfying
crisp
tart
apples
in
here
too
slight
sulphurous
match
but
other
than
that
quite
clean
and
flawless
yum
the
little
snifter
halfpint
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
batch
3
rather
clear
golden
colored
beer
with
minimal
head
and
retention
carbonation
is
abundant
bouquet
has
a
mild
funk
and
is
dominated
by
hay
and
lemons
cant
wait
to
taste
this
one
quite
sour
taste
here
induces
some
puckering
lemons
and
grapefruit
hit
you
mid
way
and
the
sourness
returns
and
lingers
through
the
finish
for
quite
some
time
i
prefer
consecreation
and
temptation
a
bit
more
but
this
is
still
another
great
beer
from
rr
which
id
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
d
gotta
be
in
the
right
mood
for
this
one
as
the
sourness
is
among
the
highest
ive
encountered
edit
22010
had
this
a
couple
more
times
from
the
bottle
and
it
grows
on
you
a
bit
still
a
bit
onedimensional
and
overdone
but
it
is
reasonably
drinkable
and
can
be
tasty
if
you
get
the
right
batch
raising
it
from
a
b
to
a
high
b
i
like
this
beer
now
d
had
a
couple
glasses
but
not
masking
too
high
of
an
abv
the
initial
sip
is
a
bit
of
a
shocker
but
after
the
taste
buds
orient
to
the
new
adventure
i
have
to
say
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
wrests
every
taste
bud
and
demands
you
hunker
down
and
contemplate
its
depths
love
the
pucker
and
the
funk
time
to
see
what
else
the
world
of
american
sours
has
in
store
i
dont
think
sours
are
really
my
thing
whihc
will
save
me
a
bundle
in
the
long
run
however
im
quite
impressed
with
this
and
i
can
see
why
some
people
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
style
a
very
wellconstructed
beer
but
not
one
id
look
for
any
time
soon
thanks
grub
d
a
low
abv
like
this
would
grant
a
whole
bottle
to
the
head
but
all
the
bugs
in
my
system
afterwards
is
not
a
good
look
and
would
eat
my
skinny
ass
up
when
i
gain
100
pounds
or
so
i
will
attempt
to
drink
a
750
of
this
for
now
sharing
is
fine
with
me
the
drinkability
on
this
is
insane
i
drank
my
glass
in
no
time
and
now
im
looking
for
more
overall
this
is
a
sweet
beer
i
like
the
sourness
but
it
still
has
a
sweet
funky
farmhouse
taste
i
can
easily
drink
more
of
this
drinkability
is
very
good
drinkabilty
is
a
tough
one
to
nail
on
this
beer
i
could
drink
one
of
these
every
year
and
be
good
so
i
cant
say
its
really
all
that
drinkable
i
dont
want
to
break
out
the
750
in
the
cellar
by
any
means
i
do
think
the
tastes
smells
and
other
components
are
great
just
not
something
id
go
back
to
repeatedly
i
will
try
this
again
d
easy
to
drink
just
not
one
that
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
a
very
solid
change
of
pace
this
is
a
very
different
beer
from
what
im
used
to
ive
had
a
few
sours
and
this
one
was
the
most
pronounced
in
every
way
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
about
an
inch
of
white
head
leaving
little
lacing
big
lemon
and
citrus
smell
some
earthy
tones
and
some
funk
you
can
tell
this
one
is
going
to
be
sour
first
taste
was
wow
that
sour
almost
in
a
bad
way
but
after
i
keep
sipping
my
taste
buds
start
to
get
used
to
what
they
are
sensing
very
tart
obviously
acidic
and
citrus
this
is
a
very
powerful
tasting
brew
i
was
thinking
about
reviewing
another
beer
tonight
but
i
dont
know
if
my
taste
buds
can
adjust
mouth
feel
is
good
not
too
much
carbonation
at
all
i
have
an
003
in
the
cellar
i
might
have
to
bust
it
out
soon
and
compare
notes
a
great
beer
very
sour
i
will
have
this
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
the
bottle
was
quite
enough
for
me
but
i
will
say
i
enjoyed
every
drop
i
think
the
fact
this
is
so
hard
to
find
will
probably
hinder
me
from
looking
forwad
to
driking
this
again
i
was
glad
it
reminded
me
of
a
gueuze
so
i
can
easly
grab
one
to
help
remind
me
of
the
experiance
great
beer
especially
for
fans
of
wild
ales
highly
recommended
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
wild
ale
for
some
time
nice
fine
bubbled
head
nice
gold
color
smells
of
citrus
and
the
best
thing
i
can
describe
it
as
is
tang
before
you
add
water
and
dilute
it
sour
funk
on
the
nose
but
moreso
on
the
palate
theres
a
sweetsour
component
where
the
brettsaccaros
mingle
that
is
very
unique
feels
light
on
the
mouth
but
very
complex
excellent
sour
d
for
the
abv
this
is
highly
drinkable
i
love
the
tartness
balanced
by
the
lemon
zest
definitely
worth
the
drink
quite
delicious
and
refreshing
making
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
big
brownie
points
for
designing
a
hardtomake
beer
especially
consistently
cheers
this
whole
experience
reminded
me
of
the
first
time
that
i
was
in
toronado
sf
and
someone
handed
the
bartender
a
tulip
of
sour
beer
it
may
have
been
beatification
and
upon
drinking
it
he
made
the
face
that
people
in
middle
school
used
to
make
when
eating
sour
warheads
afterwards
he
put
the
glass
down
and
said
thats
my
favorite
beer
i
think
i
understand
that
experience
a
little
better
now
fascinating
a
beer
though
beatification
may
be
it
is
admittedly
largely
thanks
to
those
few
belgian
brewers
who
continue
the
tradition
of
spontaneously
fermented
ales
that
such
knowledge
and
technique
were
handed
down
and
then
west
about
5500
miles
to
one
of
north
americas
most
innovative
and
talented
brewmaster
no
wonder
its
called
beatification
but
not
as
good
as
the
temptation
i
had
previously
the
current
93
slightly
hazed
real
bright
unripe
lemons
acrid
little
oranges
and
they
taste
like
this
beer
really
an
amazing
feat
in
brewing
to
get
so
much
flavor
into
one
beer
i
have
to
knock
the
drinkability
only
a
tad
because
its
so
outrageously
sour

cant

to
do
that
again
best
sour
drink
i
ever
had
well
its
the
only
one
but
i
am
going
to
hold
all
sours
to
this
standard
this
was
was
so
sour
but
so
delicious
it
literally
made
my
entire
body
pucker
the
wine
comes
thorugh
nicely
and
the
mouthfeel
is
on
point
i
aged
mine
for
about
1
5
years
and
it
drank
so
smoothly
after
by
far
the

a

complex

overall
it
gets
no
better
than
this
currently
my
favorite
beer
ever
o
overall
this
beer
is
very
dry
very
oaky
very
winelike
lightly
acidic
with
a
strong
alcohol
taste
i
hate
to
sound
sacrilegious
but
this
beer
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
just
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
if
i
really
wanted
all
of
those
wine
flavors
i
might
as
well
have
gone
with
wine
i
have
found
a
few
belgian
sours
to
be
more
pleasurable
and
interesting
to
me
but
it
is
obvious
that
many
people
get
very
excited
about
this
beer
so
i
couldnt
not
recommend
it
at
this
price
point
though
i
think
ill
be
holding
off
for
a
while
before
reevaluating
this
interesting
creation
first
time
tasting
a
sour
pours
a
purple
wine
color
with
a
little
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
not
much
lacing
but
quite
a
bit
of
suds
the
odor
is
champagne
like

like
the
taste
is

dry
sour
on
the
back
end
dark

oak
soft
balanced
palate
with
long
lingering
finish
flavor
is
tart
and
sour
with
a
dry
finish
o
very
good
beer
the
quality
just
comes
through
on
this
not
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
would
be
very
dry
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
dont
have
too
much
experience
with
sours
but
i
am
hoping
to
sample
more
to
get
a
better
grasp
on
them
odelightful
sourness
in
a
mild
way
delicious
to
sip
like
a
fine
wine
excellent
brew
from
and
excellent
brewery
why
they
are
know
for
their
hoppy
offerings
and
not
their
sours
is
a
travesty
a
very
well
balanced
sour
barrel
aged
beer
a
wonderful
fragrance
amazing
taste
with
a
nice
sour
hint
at
the
end
not
a
huge
wild
fan
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good
stuff
it
was
good
but
not
great
sour
but
pretty
straight
forward
sour
not
much
depth
pretty
much
just
a
belgian
strong
put
in
barrels
no
currants
nothing
outstanding
maybe
an
old
bottle
bottled
2013
excellent
beer
tastes
like
a
sour
champagne
really
enjoyable
fizzy
champaign
like
carbonation
makes
it
a
fun
feel
you
can
taste
the
cab
from
the
barrel
the
10
is
covered
well
cherries
very
nice
amount
of
sourness
a
begins
with
musty
wooden
malts
joined
by
prickly
currants
on
which
a
dry
funky
sourness
settles
accompanying
the
fruity
acidity
the
barrel
character
provides
wooden
oak
qualities
setting
the
balance
of
the
beer
then
the
sourness
gets
even
dryer
and
more
acidic
dryingout
the
tongue
drinks
dangerously
easy
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
finishes
with
matured
slightly
wooden
leathery
malts
with
the
addition
of
ripe
grapes
while
the
tartness
covers
the
outside
of
my
teeth
leaving
back
a
melange
of
joung
currants
and
slick
acidity
i
was
in
san
diego
for
beer
week
and
sd

had
a
russian
river
tasting
i
was
in
pursuit
of
pliny
the
elder
but
got
there
too
late
the
only
beer
left
was
the
consecration
i
am
not
generally
a
big
fan
of
the
sour
beers
but
this
was
fantastic
the
high
alcohol
was
wellhidden
under
the
many
layers
of
flavor
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
this
is
such
a
well
crafted
beer
i
enjoyed
every
aspect
of
it
from
first
to
last
sip
when
the
sour
starts
to
give
way
to
flavor
its
amazing
how
everything
comes
together
so
well
o
really
great
so
tangy
lots
of
great
flavors
o
just
slightly
behind
supplication
for
me
but
still
absolutely
world
class
i
love
red
wine
so
am
a
little
biased
but
what
vinnie
does
with
his
wine
barrels
in
just
unreal
o
probably
the
best
sour
ive
had
to
date
incredible
this
still
hangs
with
the
best
of
them
my
preference
has
always
been
supplication
and
ive
had
many
more
supplications
than
consecrations
in
my
life
but
this
right
now
is
tasting
as
good
as
the
supplication
i
had
the
other
night
they
are
really
toe
to
toe
and
i
may
even
be
enjoying
this
a
bit
more
but
possibly
because
i
hadnt
had
it
for
a
good
while
a
classic
a
legend
still
wowing
to
this
day
o
fantastically
sippable
and
enjoyable
beer
my
first
russian
river
sour
and
definitely
not
my
last
complex
very
tart
and
a
nice
berry
flavor
through
out
certainly
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
alltime
pours
a
dark
orange
hue
the
heaviness
of
the
beer
is
masked
by
the
sour
taste
while
at
the
same
time
not
taking
away
from
the
sour
taste
if
you
should
find
yourself
in
the
situation
to
buy
one
do
it
thank
you
monks
in
philadelphia
o
truly
outstanding
and
leaps
above
damnation
which
is
the
only
other
sour
ive
had
from
russian
river
the
cabernet
barrels
really
shine
through
in
the
flavor
resulting
in
a
oneofakind
taste
profile
an
amazing
sour
brown
ale
with
delicious
tart
dark
fruit
aromas
and
flavors
with
cabernet
sauvignon
accents
world
class
m
absolutely
no
head
yet
an
interesting
effervescent
feel
to
it
fuller
bodied
than
supplication
yet
just
as
easily
drinkable
still
cant
get
over
how
dry
it
is
as
well
its
in
perfect
balance
poured
into
a
chalice
from
a
1
5
year
old
bottle
smelled
very
champagney
and
tasted
the
same
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
more
tart
and
sour
but
it
wasnt
it
was
almost
too
balanced
which
unfortunately
i
do
not
like
as
much
with
wild
ales
still
was
outstanding
though
just
not
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
pours
a
delicious
dark
reddish
brown
color
smells
pure
of
funky
yeast
taste
very
tart
maybe
some
blackcurrants
definitively
some
grapes
from
the
barrels
has
high
acidity
has
to
be
enjoyed
little
by
little
if
not
its
too
sour
good
work
o
another
amazing
sour
from
rr
murders
other
currant
based
sours
ive
had
thus
far
overall
the
best
sour
i
have
ever
had
and
one
of
the
top
5
beers
i
have
ever
had
batch
001x1
amazing
with
about
6
years
on
it
not
acidic
or
overly
sour
super
smooth
and
velvety
with
some
caramel
notes
this
is
a
beast
poured
dark
ruby
with
a
2
finger
fine
bubble
head
the
nose
indicates
this
is
going
to
be
sour
notes
of
sour
yeast
neutral
oak
and
dried
cherries
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
much
the
same
excellent
very
smooth
high
carbonation
this
is
an
incredible
sour
this
is
very
rounded
and
consistent
obviously
drink
this
overall
top
notch
example
of
a
barrel
aged
sour
a
bit
immature
so
i
will
store
the
2nd
bottle
for
another
year
or
so
to
compare
overall
spectacular
wild
ale
favorite
to
date
russian
river
always
has
a
flavor
profile
that
is
complex
moldy
and
vinegar
aromas
flavor
is
way
more
sour
than
expected
a
lot
of
grape
cranberry
currant
even
some
grapefruit
sourness
starts
off
mellow
in
the
sip
ends
brutal
very
tart
its
complex
though
and
each
sip
has
a
story
to
tell
still
no
supplication
to
me
anyway
overall
really
well
done
beer
and
the
age
has
done
wonders
many
cabernet
qualities
but
much
softer
and
a
little
funk
really
an
excellent
drinking
experience
o
my
favorite
sour
as
the
interplay
between
the
intense
tangfunkfruitoak
is
just
perfect
overall
a
surprising
and
exciting
ale
even
though
i
had
an
idea
of
what
to
expect
going
into
it
ridiculously
funky
in
the
nose
with
a
leveling
sour
tang
in
the
taste
that
is
wrapped
up
nicely
in
a
package
by
the
wine
barrel
and
some
encouraging
fruityness
at
the
finish
the
true
story
behind
the
name
of
this
ale
is
that
jesus
did
not
turn
water
into
wine
but
water
into
beer
hence
the
name
recommend
consumption
during
worship
services
recommend
pairing
with
dark
chocolate
with
strawberry
filling
o
obviously
a
very
high
quality
offering
but
not
for
everyone
if
you
are
into
lindemans
or
sours
this
is
a
must
try
rating
45
zombie
heads
bottle
from
the
brewery
poured
to
a
ynibroue
tulip
glass
this
one
pours
dark
reddish
purple
with
a
hint
of
brown
and
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
in
a
fizzy
furry
aroma
is
strong
vinous
cabernet
notes
sour
vinegar
black
cherry
and
other
fruits
flavor
is
a
beautiful
medley
of
dark
cherries
and
sour
vinegar
some
bold
wine
like
notes
other
fruits
and
a
bit
of
booze
intermingled
with
oak
on
the
back
end
super
tart
and
sour
with
nearly
spritzy
high
carbonation
heavy
bodied
and
a
big
beer
that
can
probably
sneak
up
on
you
good
stuff
o
a
must
have
for
a
sour
lover
not
a
great
introductory
sour
ill
take
any
bottle
up
for
grabs
it
sucks
o
this
could
be
the
beer
that
launches
me
into
more
and
more
sour
drinking
nicely
balanced
for
such
a
big
sour
beer
really
well
done
beer
that
has
great
cab
qualities
imparted
into
it
o
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
given
the
style
of
the
beer
the
style
of
the
wine
barrels
the
talent
of
the
brewers
and
the
addition
of
wild
yeast
its
delicious
o
aging
did
not
seem
to
improve
this
at
all
o
overall
im
not
sure
if
its
the
syrup
like
flavour
aspects
of
this
or
what
but
im
just
not
digging
it
i
want
to
like
it
hell
i
want
to
love
it
unfortunately
though
i
do
not
o
big
sour
fruits
in
this
one
no
major
acetone
vinegar
or
even
the
typical
citric
acid
just
mouth
puckering
sour
fruits
very
interesting
big
sharp
bold
flavors
throughout
almost
no
sweetness
all
tartness
with
a
drying
aftertaste
pretty
unusual
for
a
10
abv
beer
of
any
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wine
barrel
beers
but
this
is
still
a
quality
brew
had
aged
the
cats
meow
i
love
russian
river
sours
they
are
second
to
non
temptation
is
my
favorite
in
the
line
of
sours
but
this
one
is
amazing
as
well
a
little
bit
of
the
old
world
funk
and
some
nice
barrel
flavor
as
well
they
have
also
mastered
the
perfect
sour
taste
not
like
love
child
where
it
taste
artificial
and
just
pure
sour
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
an
absolutely
superb
sour
ticking
all
the
right
boxes
reminds
me
of
a
vintage
rodenbach
in
its
balance
complexity
and
subtlety
jd
bottom
line
amazing
beer
period
the
only
bad
part
is
i
am
an
ipa
fiend
overall
this
is
another
fantastic
sour
from
russian
river
the
flavor
profile
keeps
changing
with
each
sip
will
seek
out
again
overall
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
this
after
months
of
begging
my
californian
friends
to
send
me
some
really
solid
brew
not
sure
id
seek
out
a
whole
lot
more
of
it
but
its
very
good
o
being
that
i
live
on
the
east
coast
its
a
bit
of
a
bummer
i
wont
be
able
to
try
this
again
soon
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
and
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
an
amazing
sour
i
defiantly
have
a
world
yet
to
explore
but
this
is
the
sour
flavor
at
least
i
have
been
looking
for
perhaps
its
a
more
obvious
beer
than
supplication
the
only
other
rr
sour
ive
had
but
i
appreciate
that
aspect
i
really
really
enjoy
this
russian
river
does
it
yet
again
with
this
incredible
brew
consecration
is
an
incredibly
unique
libation
that
i
honestly
cant
get
enough
of
i
will
be
getting
more
bottles
in
the
future
without
a
doubt
thanks
for
this
treat
bill
an
excellent
sour
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
though
i
like
supplication
better
this
one
is
darker
and
much
more
harsh
on
the
tongue
overall
its
wonderful
and
truly
bridges
the
gap
between
beer
and
wine
imo
glad
i
have
one
more
but
wish
i
had
more
than
that
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
sour
that
could
just
use
some
refinement
and
balance
overall
another
solid
american
sour
from
rr
but
at
12
a
bottle
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
i
sincerely
wish
they
would
cut
the
cost
of
these
brews
in
half
to
make
them
somewhat
affordable
overall
very
nice
barrel
aged
fruit
forward
wild
reminiscent
of
crooked
staves
sour
quad
a
good
candidate
for
sharing
with
another
person
this
is
rather
light
bodied
it
goes
down
quickly
and
leaves
a
film
on
your
tongue
this
beer
just
got
better
each
drink
fantastic
medium
bodied
delicious
sour
probably
my
favorite
out
of
russian
river
cheers
overall
my
first
taste
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
that
went
through
some
sort
of
souring
process
forward
with
the
overall
taste
of
fruit
but
the
maltiness
sticks
up
for
itself
not
overpoweringly
sour
but
it
definitely
has
a
bit
of
a
kick
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
had
a
vertical
tasting
at
toronado
in
san
diego
in
august
2012
that
was
an
amazing
experience
served
from
a
bottle
aged
1
year
in
my
refrigerator
beer
pours
dark
purplish
brown
with
very
little
head
but
a
lot
of
fizzy
carbonation
the
mouth
feel
is
fizzy
with
a
pleasant
tart
puckering
the
taste
is
vinegar
and
very
little
malt
and
granny
smith
apple
peel
in
my
top
five
sours
of
all
time
and
proof
that
russian
river
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
america
a
very
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
of
rrs
sours
that
remains
supplication
fruity
and
pleasant
with
just
a
little
too
much
sour
and
bitter
poking
out
through
the
cracks
beyond
those
criticisms
russian
river
consecration
is
a
finely
crafted
brew
if
you
are
looking
for
a
brew
to
serve
to
a
group
of
friends
looking
to
have
a
few
this
may
not
be
it
if
however
you
are
looking
for
an
immaculatelycrafted
beer
full
of
surprises
then
try
this
one
this
beer
really
stands
out
for
me
having
had
it
next
to
supplication
i
preferred
this
actually
its
so
interesting
because
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
has
had
more
red
wine
character
in
it
that
this
this
for
me
is
probably
the
best
wild
ales
i
have
had
what
a
treat
its
so
different
and
amazing
od
enjoyed
it
too
bad
there
couldnt
be
more
malt
complexity
with
the
brett
dialed
back
carbonation
was
also
a
bit
much
and
made
tasting
a
bit
difficult
not
bad
for
a
wild
ale
though
and
was
pleasant
to
drink
but
didnt
seem
to
break
new
ground
for
the
style
o
reminds
me
more
of
drinking
a
slightly
tart
red
wine
than
a
beer
so
to
speak
but
it
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
experience
due
to
the
tartness
it
was
one
that
i
needed
to
enjoy
by
sipping
rather
slowly
but
it
is
definitely
a
phenomenal
beer
nice
job
of
balancing
the
sourness
with
the
red
wine
flavors
o
this
beer
has
a
good
balance
for
an
barrel
aged
beer
and
doesnt
seem
too
winey
pours
a
deep
ruby
with
soda
like
off
white
head
smells
like
vinagar
with
some
fruity
tones
tastes
like
tart
plums
and
blackberries
with
a
little
bit
of
oak
and
a
slight
alcohol
burn
mouthfeel
is
light
with
fairly
high
carbonation
i
had
this
beer
years
ago
and
hated
it
but
i
think
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
this
was
very
suprising
i
dont
know
what
temp
russiannriver
suggests
to
drink
this
but
ifwhen
i
drink
this
again
i
will
start
closer
to
the
temp
i
drink
wine
it
made
a
world
of
difference
to
me
d
complex
and
addicting
i
love
this
beer
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
strong
and
really
gives
force
to
the
term
sour
a
delightfully
complex
and
unique
beer
pours
a
deep
red
with
very
little
head
that
doesnt
linger
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
definitely
has
a
unique
smell
of
raisin
cabernet
wine
champagne
and
sour
dark
fruits
like
prunes
or
dates
initial
taste
is
one
of
a
rolling
bubble
champagne
but
complex
taste
where
i
really
got
some
of
the
red
wine
flavors
overall
very
delicious
and
a
fairly
heavy
hitter
for
a
wild
on
the
alcohol
content
o
4
5
one
of
the
better
american
sour
ales
brewed
with
a
concoction
of
yeast
and
bacteria
there
are
some
really
nice
flavors
and
aromas
imparted
by
the
aging
in
cabernet
savignon
barrels
however
i
am
a
little
underwhelmed
after
seeing
a
99
rating
on
ba
i
picked
it
up
for
13
99
in
sf
which
to
be
frank
is
too
steep
for
the
quality
and
have
seen
it
for
as
much
as
30
00
in
d
c
which
to
be
franker
is
insane
o
i
consider
this
to
be
an
imperial
flanders
with
a
twist
and
a
very
tasty
one
certainly
not
the
most
extreme
sour
but
that
isnt
a
negative
coming
from
a
sour
head
brewed
with
careful
restraint
but
far
from
being
bland
very
good
beer
a
serving
type
12oz
bottle
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
thanks
for
reading
thanks
to
etf
fest
for
this
sample
overall
another
awesome
awa
by
russian
river
its
definitely
a
beer
that
any
wine
lover
would
enjoy
and
absolutely
a
beer
that
any
sour
lover
will
love
it
borrows
a
lot
of
characteristics
of
the
used
cabernet
barrels
but
the
base
malt
really
makes
itself
known
amidst
all
the
sour
darkfruity
and
earthy
funkiness
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
that
comes
together
very
well
and
its
truly
an
excellent
bottle
of
beer
to
drink
4
5
anyway
well
done
russian
river
you
have
outdone
yourself
yet
again
we
need
to
plan
a
trip
to
california
so
we
can
start
visiting
some
of
these
brewing
companies
cheers
o
710
sourness
another
good
sour
from
rr
light
sweetness
with
vinegar
and
dark
fruits
make
this
a
well
balanced
sour
i
would
take
supplication
over
this
but
this
is
still
close
wow
this
definitely
is
very
different
from
other
sours
ive
had
and
is
a
totally
different
beast
compared
to
supplication
for
instance
theres
less
focus
on
fruit
or
tart
and
lot
more
on
grape
must
oak
melding
properties
and
bacterial
funk
not
my
favorite
but
really
refined
and
perhaps
unlike
any
american
wild
ale
in
the
country
i
will
be
sure
to
save
another
one
of
these
for
a
special
occasion
its
not
as
accessible
and
definitely
for
wine
fans
such
as
myself
and
of
the
strange
and
sour
stuff
but
its
definitely
a
must
for
people
looking
to
get
into
more
ambitious
beer
styles
world
class
stuff
in
my
view
thanks
to
great
beer
friends
that
appreciate
sharing
with
others
overall
we
have
a
world
class
beer
right
here
russian
river
really
knows
what
theyre
doing
and
may
hold
the
top
spot
as
best
brewery
in
the
world
with
so
many
quality
offerings
i
return
to
this
beer
again
and
again
this
was
far
superior
to
the
bottled
versions
id
buy
bottles
again
but
i
will
always
order
it
if
its
available
on
tap
final
thoughts
this
is
only
the
third
or
fourth
sour
ive
had
but
it
was
very
good
and
easily
approachable
for
any
craft
drinker
i
would
hazard
a
guess
that
the
oak
aging
has
really
smoothed
out
the
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
but
its
definitely
a
special
occasion
type
of
beer
overall
really
digging
sours
and
this
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
of
must
haves
another
world
class
impression
of
the
american
wild
by
rr
the
cabernet
barrel
aging
really
adds
a
whole
new
dimension
of
complexity
to
this
beer
well
done
o
a
sterling
beer
that
ive
passed
over
too
many
times
to
count
while
off
chasing
the
newest
sour
from
around
the
block
consecration
beckons
us
back
to
its
sublime
balanced
fruitiness
delicious
o
a
phenomenal
sour
if
you
like
sours
a
nice
blend
that
blends
the
best
of
wines
and
beers
overall
phenomenal
sour
brings
a
strong
pucker
without
being
overwhelming
the
wine
barrels
are
very
complementary
to
the
base
sour
and
it
results
in
a
very
complex
delicious
beer
d
a
nice
treat
of
a
wild
here
so
much
acidity
the
bacteria
really
went
nuts
on
all
this
sugar
producing
vinous
tart
flavors
and
aromas
by
the
boatload
would
have
been
nice
to
have
an
aged
version
to
do
a
sidebyside
maybe
next
time
overall
a
very
different
beer
than
supplication
which
speaks
to
the
creativeness
of
russian
river
in
my
mind
this
beer
highlights
the
balance
and
smooth
texture
of
the
ideal
awa
and
is
wellcomplemented
by
cab
sauv
barrel
aging
equally
as
good
in
my
opinion
worldclass
enjoy
whenever
available
o
still
cant
handle
these
all
the
time
but
this
certainly
is
a
treat
o
consecration
that
has
been
aging
for
5
years
is
the
single
best
sour
available
better
then
the
6
cantillons
duck
duck
gooze
cable
car
and
8
cascade
beers
ive
had
i
was
so
pumped
to
have
this
way
more
than
worth
it
o
so
i
really
liked
this
beers
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
rr
sour
it
has
some
sourness
and
tartness
but
not
enough
imo
and
could
do
with
a
little
more
carbonation
though
that
is
really
just
nitpicking
as
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
o
yeah
i
definitely
dig
the
darker
sours
more
than
the
lighter
ones
probably
my
favorite
rr
sour
to
date
my
first
rr
wild
ale
and
hopefully
not
my
last
this
was
some
seriously
good
shit
so
satisfyingly
tart
sour
and
sweet
with
a
perfect
flavor
profile
of
authentic
fruits
insanely
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
ridiculous
on
draft
at
capones
pours
a
clear
dark
redamber
with
beige
head
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
balsamic
vinegar
and
ripe
wine
the
taste
is
tart
as
expected
from
the
nose
not
as
sour
as
some
oud
bruin
but
rr
supplication
but
still
good
a
good
beer
but
not
one
i
am
inclined
to
drink
regularly
overall
i
enjoy
it
im
fairly
new
to
sours
but
this
reassures
me
that
its
a
style
that
i
reeeaally
like
i
really
enjoy
the
wine
character
and
it
makes
me
want
it
to
feel
more
velvety
this
was
my
first
russian
river
and
all
of
the
hype
ive
read
and
heard
seems
merited
to
me
o
a
delicious
sour
ale
by
russian
river
tried
one
after
a
little
bit
of
age
much
more
of
the
current
taste
cherry
falls
in
the
background
as
it
warms
you
taste
that
base
beer
more
most
definitely
a
good
ager
pours
a
muddy
red
with
high
carbonation
no
head
at
all
and
moderate
lacing
aroma
of
sour
cheery
apple
citrus
with
a
sweet
malt
backbone
all
the
standard
ingredients
to
a
sour
taste
follows
the
nose
well
sour
cherry
tart
apple
grape
oak
berries
sweet
malts
and
some
alcohol
feel
is
full
bodied
with
a
good
tingle
on
the
tongue
very
juicy
makes
my
mouth
water
overall
a
solid
sour
from
russian
river
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
beer
ages
very
good
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
amazing
wild
ale
it
is
perfectly
balanced
in
its
flavors
and
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
o
i
love
the
russian
river
sours
which
really
showcases
the
ingenuity
creativity
and
wine
background
of
brewmaster
vinnie
cilurzo
consecration
marries
a
dark
sweetness
with
a
balsamic
vinegar
bite
with
wonderful
subtleties
inbetween
pours
dark
brown
mostly
clear
body
head
settles
quickly
smells
sour
and
funky
tastes
sour
and
has
nice
notes
of
currants
and
cabernet
sauvignon
palate
is
alive
and
bubbly
overall
much
better
than
the
first
time
i
tried
this
3
years
ago
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
far
better
than
i
thought
itd
be
not
bad
o
great
example
of
whats
possible
for
this
style
a
very
friendly
brew
that
it
full
of
flavor
yet
simple
enough
to
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
if
more
readily
available
or
if
my
wallet
and
gas
tank
could
afford
it
but
regardless
great
beer
that
i
will
continue
to
drink
as
often
as
i
can
visit
our
good
friends
over
in
santa
rosa
ca
o
never
had
a
beer
like
this
good
beer
making
me
excited
to
try
more

lots

throughout
the
taste
and
palate
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
rr
sour
series
more
robust
than
supplication
not
as
soft
as
temptation
and
sanctification
o
this
was
a
very
nice
sour
that
had
a
great
wine
presence
to
it
there
was
a
nice
fruity
tartness
to
it
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
had
and
i
enjoyed
it
more
then
the
temptation
we
had
right
before
this
i
highly
recommend
checking
this
beer
out
o
a
good
sour
ale
with
an
progressive
taste
even
if
redcurrant
is
not
particularly
my
thing
i
found
the
palate
is
even
more
interesting
than
the
nose
it
offers
a
very
nice
balance
between
sourness
woodiness
and
fruitiness
overall
another
world
class
beer
from
russian
river
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
supplication
but
still
a
very
good
sour
o
such
a
fantastic
beer
im
glad
i
had
one
of
the
older
batches
that
has
had
time
to
develop
i
could
see
this
beer
having
a
more
upfront
sourness
and
vinegar
taste
since
it
had
time
to
mellow
out
a
bit
the
sourness
is
quite
faint
and
upfront
it
allows
the
flavors
of
the
dark
fruits
chocolate
and
oak
to
really
shine
in
the
finish
o
this
is
a
magnificent
beersour
but
so
complex
and
the
wine
barrels
play
so
well
off
the
tart
currants
so
damn
good
oi
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
it
has
a
really
nice
wellbalanced
smell
and
flavor
profile
that
not
many
brews
can
match
that
being
said
the
appearance
is
underwhelming
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dead
o
the
cab
didnt
overtake
the
base
beer
which
is
awesome
it
gave
it
just
enough
earthy
undertones
to
provide
some
more
depths
of
flavor
this
is
right
up
there
with
supplication
as
my
favorite
rr
sour
the
booze
is
extremely
well
hidden
as
well
well
put
together
the
beer
pours
a
relatively
clear
light
browndark
amber
with
a
razor
thin
halo
of
white
head
the
beers
nose
is
complex
with
tart
currant
fruitiness
buttery
oak
and
blistering
alcohol
as
expected
this
beer
drinks
like
a
fine
wine
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
fruit
forward
flavor
yeast
funk
and
oak
its
a
touch
too
acidic
but
the
booming
flavors
pull
together
and
mask
the
beers
staggering
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
puckeringly
sour
and
mostly
dry
with
a
touch
of
initial
sweetness
there
is
a
mildly
umpleasant
funk
that
lingers
but
the
mouthwatering
sourness
cleanses
the
palate
quickly
this
is
an
excellent
beer
thats
worth
the
hunt
i
have
to
admit
while
i
really
like
this
beer
i
can
find
similar
belgian
offerings
cheaper
and
more
easily
its
worth
drinking
but
its
not
worth
what
you
have
to
pay
or
go
through
to
obtain
d
a
bigger
juicier
sour
variant
from
rr
im
not
sure
it
has
the
finesse
of
supplication
but
it
touches
that
nice
jam
sweetness
without
offsetting
the
good
sourness
nice
brew
easy
recommendation
pours
a
deep
dark
maroonpurple
very
rich
color
strong
aroma
of
cabernet
grapes
cherries
and
blackberries
flavor
begins
with
puckering
cherry
and
blackberry
notes
very
nice
followed
by
big
tobacco
notes
some
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
beer
bits
of
oak
as
well
big
bold
and
sweet
cabernet
wine
notes
on
the
finish
great
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
beginning
tart
berry
and
cherry
flavors
a
big
bold
sour
very
worthy
of
the
cab
barrels
it
was
aged
in
as
it
picks
up
a
lot
of
this
bold
wines
flavor
profile
excellent
pours
out
dark
brown
black
with
thin
brown
foam
which
quickly
falls
smells
is
sweet
and
funky
with
some
wood
taste
is
fizzy
with
nice
tartness
great
sour
cherry
notes
with
some
funk
present
dry
finish
with
great
sticky
sweetness
one
of
their
best
beers
o
fantastic
even
worth
the
18
or
more
it
sells
for
here
in
philadelphia
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
its
one
delicious
beer
this
was
a
batch

httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
ive
tried
this
several
times
the
old
bottles
are
insane
so
complex
and
interesting
the
newer
bottles
are
great
as
well
but
they
push
a
lot
more
acetic
and
tart
not
a
bad
thing
just
a
thing
o
very
tart
sour
from
russian
river
with
only
a
slight
funkiness
to
it
this
only
really
brings
the
tart
was
but
it
is
almpmost
too
tart
for
me
to
pick
up
anything
else
in
it
o
delicious
awesome
barrel
character
i
cant
believe
this
beer
is
10
overall
a
very
good
american
wild
ale
worthy
of
a
special
occasion
i
love
the
winelike
qualities
in
this
onealthough
i
do
prefer
supplication
this
one
is
a
complex
sipper
that
i
would
pick
up
in
a
heartbeat
if
i
could
find
it
reddish
brown
color
with
small
off
white
head
lots
of
sour
in
the
nose
red
wine
vinegar
cherries
and
oak
taste
is
a
nice
sour
cherry
with
dark
fruit
full
bodied
and
decent
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
best
sours
out
there
dont
waste
time
trying
to
age
it
perfect
fresh
my
most
wonderful
girlfriend
hooked
this
up
for
me
it
almost
looks
like
a
glass
of
rootbeer
brownish
in
color
lively
carbonation
and
a
faint
red
glow
the
head
is
excited
but
quickly
receding
the
smell
is
a
dead
giveaway
that
this
is
another
russian
river
sour
gem
notes
of
vinegar
decaying
wood
dried
plums
caramel
corn
and
cane
sugar
unite
in
an
aromatic
orgy
the
taste
is
incredible
the
currants
are
obvious
up
front
but
the
finish
is
what
makes
this
beer
its
so
sour
it
hurts
my
jaw
sour
more
than
brett
too
its
sort
of
like
sucking
on
a
lemon
for
as
long
as
you
can
puckery
funky
and
delicious
its
too
complex
to
finger
all
the
flavors
here
but
many
many
more
of
these
need
to
be
consumed
to
fully
appreciate
it
fully
the
mouthfeel
is
as
perfect
as
it
can
be
medium
body
made
light
by
the
effervescent
carbonation
and
tart
bone
dry
finish
that
somehow
makes
my
mouth
water
for
another
sip
how
the
hell
is
this
10
abv
it
is
not
at
all
detectable
in
the
flavor
or
the
feel
and
im
just
waiting
on
my
buzz
overall
this
may
surpass
suplication
as
my
favorite
russian
river
brew
they
do
some
incredible
stuff
out
there
and
this
is
the
cream
of
the
crop
if
i
play
my
cards
right
my
girlfriend
might
get
me
another
o
incredible
wild
ale
that
takes
so
many
different
properties
and
delivers
with
a
fantastic
brew
not
many
beers
like
this
in
the
world
will
be
trying
to
find
a
way
to
get
more
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
it
was
extraordinarily
complex
but
blended
so
well
that
what
we
were
given
was
a
cohesive
definitive
endproduct
the
sourness
is
gloriously
huge
and
as
in
the
nose
each
taste
of
it
becomes
more
inviting
than
the
last
additionally
the
10
abv
is
almost
virtually
unnoticeable
allowing
space
for
the
yeast
and
the
intrinsic
flavorings
to
work
their
magic
lives
up
to
the
hype
incredible
sour
with
great
power
but
also
great
balance
10
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
allows
the
beer
to
be
more
full
bodied
very
very
easy
to
drink
a
world
class
offering
reminds
me
of
abbaye
de
saint
bonchien
only
wish
i
could
have
this
as
a
regular
offering
the
west
coast
beer
drinkers
are
lucky
highly
recommend
realistically
russian
river
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
again
and
theyve
clearly
demonstrated
that
they
dominate
not
only
with
ipas
but
also
sourwilds
i
give
the
upper
hand
to
supplication
but
try
both
this
pours
a
wonderful
hazy
ruddy
browncherry
red
with
thin
whispers
of
foam
theres
an
incredibly
vibrant
tartly
sour
aroma
of
berries
and
cherries
that
pops
and
swirls
and
tickles
the
olfactory
factory
on
the
palate
its
more
more
more
with
a
finish
that
i
only
wish
lasted
as
long
as
the
memories
incredibly
good
stuff
drinkability
an
all
around
decent
sour
but
i
drank
it
next
to
a
cuvee
des
jacobins
which
a
lot
of
other
reviewers
did
and
i
think
that
was
better
side
by
side
o
a
pleasing
sour
id
expect
no
less
from
russian
river
o
it
has
a
depth
of
flavor
that
is
much
more
interesting
than
many
in
this
style
these
different
flavors
play
off
of
each
other
well
enough
that
it
doesnt
overpower
you
with
any
one
of
them
o
i
love
these
wine
barrel
aged
beers
from
russian
river
they
really
do
take
brewing
to
the
next
level
of
creativity
o
good
but
not
great
im
not
sure
i
understand
the
fuss
not
worth
the
price
but
worth
drinking
good
wild
ale
overall
good
but
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
rr
sours
i
have
so
far
sanctification
supplication
consecration
like
all
of
their
sours
this
gem
from
rr
is
worth
seeking
out
as
good
as
it
is
i
didnt
enjoy
it
nearly
as
much
as
supplication
which
for
my
palate
has
a
nearly
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
this
beer
is
probably
more
for
fans
of
intensely
sour
beers
o
more
of
a
wine
then
a
beer
must
say
i
like
this
more
then
supplication
the
taste
and
smell
will
blow
your
hair
back
oanother
tasty
sour
from
rr
which
i
enjoyed
even
more
as
it
warmed
o
4
5
o
an
incredible
beer
hugely
complex
blends
tartness
barrel
character
and
malt
perfectly
this
is
really
excellent
stuff
this
overhyped
concoction
was
a
major
let
down
for
me
after
wrestling
this
thing
for
several
swallows
of
varied
volume
it
ended
in
drain
pour
a
good
brew
should
not
make
me
pucker
and
salivate
profusely
consecration
lacks
the
allimportant
balance
i
search
for
in
a
good
brew
now
i
can
say
been
there
done
that
2010
750
ml
pours
a
transparent
dark
amber
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
complex
aroma
of
sweet
dark
cherries
and
oak
starts
with
nice
biting
carbonation
and
tart
complex
oak
and
cherries
with
some
other
dark
fruit
notes
and
good
acidity
toward
a
slightly
warming
finish
shared
with
3
other
people
damn
im
a
nice
guy
o
yum
a
gentlemans
beer
great
sour
although
i
still
prefer
supplication
if
you
are
a
red
wine
fan
as
well
as
a
wild
fan
this
will
up
your
alley
a
beer
thats
hard
to
really
describe
concisely
in
words
its
a
musttry
for
anyone
even
remotely
interested
in
the
vast
creative
potential
of
this
beloved
liquid
we
call
beer
originally
reviewed

o
this
is
not
beer
its
wine
after
i
finished
this
i
had
to
switch
to
wine
for
the
night
there
is
no
way
to
transition
to
an
ipa
or
any
kind
of
malt
driven
beverage
after
you
have
one
of
these
a
masterpiece
thank
you
continually
impressed
by
rr
wild
ales
overall
another
solid
offering
by
russian
river
glad
i
picked
it
up
a
must
try
for
any
fan
of
sour
beers
with
berry
characteristics
d
very
drinkable
i
really
like
how
sour
the
beer
is
but
at
the
same
time
the
balance
is
still
very
good
the
dark
fruits
really
compliment
the
sourness
nicely
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
like
mouth
puckering
beers
verdict
this
is
fantastic
this
beer
is
aging
gracefully
although
i
would
be
weary
of
aging
it
too
much
further
as
the
currant
flavors
could
easily
drop
off
leaving
behind
a
bit
of
a
vinegary
mess
the
fruit
flavors
are
nice
and
tart
and
impressively
potent
which
is
all
one
can
hope
for
in
an
aged
beer
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
a
vintage
sour
from
russian
river
make
no
mistake
you
will
be
well
rewarded
more
amazing
from
the
bottle
than
ontap
deep
mahogany
with
a
perfect
dose
of
bonecolored
foam
on
top
sour
certainly
but
deep
and
complex
cherry
plum
and
toffee
at
the
base
with
a
nice
spicy
brettanomyces
note
leather
shortbread
vanilla
and
red
wine
vinegar
as
it
warms
great
balance
between
fruit
sour
and
malt
the
price
is
steep
but
the
beer
is
nearly
perfect
american
craft
beer
at
its
finest
oh
and
the
10
5
abv
is
silent
pretty
great
much
like
what
i
hoped
it
would
be
d
damn
fine
sour
ale
that
showcases
how
well
it
can
pair
w
fruit
wild
refined
complexity
here
one
of
the
greatest
taste
is
good
but
not
as
exciting
as
the
aroma
it
has
tartsour
fruits
and
wood
up
front
light
winy
sweetness
it
is
very
drinkable
has
a
good
lively
feel
however
it
is
rather
onedimensional
and
not
interesting
lacking
in
complexity
or
depth
of
character
and
thus
gets
somewhat
boring
rather
quickly
o
definitely
a
good
sour
beer
though
not
my
favorite
rr
sour
so
far
i
considered
changing
my
description
of
the
flavor
im
assuming
that
i
tasted
cabernet
not
merlot
but
i
decided
to
leave
my
initial
impression
intact
and
expose
my
wine
ignorance
m
this
is
a
lighter
medium
mouthfeel
for
me
its
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
overall
he
went
from
wine
to
beer
artist
to
artist
10
abv
never
tasted
so
nonalcoholic
cheers
to
me
this
is
everything
geat
about
roddenbach
grand
cru
time
a
thousand
more
complexity
more
sourness
more
leather
more
better
clear
brown
with
a
dark
red
tint
amazing
currants
jucy
sour
balanced
tobacco
oak
and
clove
its
hard
for
me
to
describe
just
how
much
youll
like
it
subtle
and
delicious
but
crazy
complex
get
it
was
able
to
try
this
at
the
brewery
poured
dark
rosey
amber
very
sour
but
i
preferred
supplication
theres
a
little
bit
more
of
booze
in
the
taste
with
a
more
malty
finish
makes
your
mouth
pucker
though
this
brewery
sure
knows
what
its
doing
with
sours
this
is
a
topnotch
sour
ive
heard
these
and
other
rr
sours
can
go
downhill
after
some
aging
but
im
excited
to
check
in
on
my
batch
006
in
a
year
or
two
a
must
try
4
5
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
i
would
have
preferred
a
crisper
livelier
and
cleaner
feel
although
the
finish
is
quite
dry
interesting
beer
to
be
sure
curious
about
the
stillness
of
this
particularly
bottle
very
good
but
not
as
appealing
as
supplication
sanctification
or
temptation
for
my
money
i
see
a
trend
developing
with
russian
river
great
stuff
being
brewed
yet
another
big
thank
you
too
rutager
for
sending
me
this
one
along
with
many
others
overall
interesting
flavors
but
a
huge
sour
ale
that
gets
sluggish
and
repetitive
as
i
drink
it
tasty
but
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
the
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
gave
a
reddish
brown
hue
with
a
modest
head
the
head
rapidly
disappears
giving
a
better
look
at
the
beer
the
initial
taste
immediately
caused
me
to
think
of
a
tart
lemon
candy
though
as
the
flavor
develops
one
can
sense
sour
red
fruit
flavors
that
are
rounded
by
oak
chips
there
are
a
certain
vinegar
notes
typical
of
a
sour
present
the
spiciness
leads
well
into
the
aftertaste
which
ends
the
experience
on
a
dry
note
the
modest
level
of
carbonation
allows
the
flavors
to
linger
and
develop
of
course
this
is
improtant
because
consecration
is
a
complex
beer
overall
this
is
a
splendid
ale
from
rr
its
probably
my
favorite
wild
ale
that
ive
had
from
them
this
or
beatification
totally
different
though
i
usually
try
to
keep
these
in
stock
because
of
how
available
they
are
just
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
great
fresh
or
aged
too
the
bottle
i
had
was
one
of
the
newer
batches
though
007
pours
an
opaque
caramel
color
with
no
head
tart
apple
and
belgian
yeast
aromas
ok
so
im
not
a
wild
fan
at
all
i
mean
as
much
as
i
want
to
get
it
i
just
dont
have
you
ever
picked
up
a
sack
of
apples
that
have
fallen
off
the
tree
the
sack
was
left
outside
all
night
you
went
out
the
next
late
afternoon
and
picked
them
up
the
movement
stirred
the
honey
bees
inside
you
stuck
your
head
in
the
sack
this
beer
tastes
like
that
apple
sack
smells
i
do
enjoy
how
after
the
beer
disappears
from
the
palate
and
i
lick
my
lips
theres
a
sweet
taste
that
subsequently
appears
on
the
tongue
im
still
developing
my
palate
for
the
wilds
bear
with
me
o
very
good
stuff
a
very
drinkable
sipper
sour
o
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
drinking
several
months
later
i
now
understand
what
a
sour
beer
is
i
appreciate
them
much
more
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
ive
had
sanctification
beatification
and
temptation
this
week
and
this
beer
is
just
as
awesome
o
a
very
good
sour
beer
there
are
a
lot
of
dimensions
to
this
beer
it
covers
sour
tart
funky
vinegar
and
tangy
the
fruit
flavor
is
also
vibrant
this
is
my
first
wild
ale
im
impressed
its
complex
drinkable
smooth
refreshing
but
a
sipper
if
rr
was
available
around
nc
i
would
have
this
more
often
for
sure
batch
7
this
tastes
like
hes
starting
to
dial
in
the
recipe
it
is
similar
to
batch
5
but
with
less
acetic
burn
it
has
a
dominant
lactic
sourness
though
it
is
not
palatedestroying
or
stomachchurning
with
a
huge
buildup
of
tannic
currant
and
grape
skin
in
the
finish
the
barrel
is
really
prominent
here
the
cabernet
sauvignon
is
unmistakable
making
the
beer
taste
like
a
slightly
soured
wine
good
not
great
3
63
o
russian
river
is
out
of
hand
love
it
nicely
done
american
sour
the
cab
barrel
and
blackberry
add
a
little
something
extra
that
is
nice
the
medium
body
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
swallow
but
just
a
tad
sticky
the
carbonation
is
worse
than
a
bowl
of
rice
krispies
with
milk
being
added
as
the
beer
warms
the
carbonation
seems
to
die
down
really
letting
all
the
flavors
come
to
fruition
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
example
of
a
american
wild
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
was
glad
i
tried
it
overall
really
really
dug
this
i
could
literally
picture
the
currants
i
was
tasting
in
the
beer
abv
has
zero
impediment
and
this
awesome
blend
is
excellent
highly
recommended
to
any
entry
or
veteran
sour
lover
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
has
a
big
red
wine
character
o
consecration
is
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
had
its
extremely
well
done
and
inviting
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
oa
very
complex
beer
combining
flavors
found
in
guezue
cabernet
and
a
dark
ale
the
most
complex
sour
ive
tasted
from
us
easy
to
drink
with
something
new
to
discover
in
every
sip
this
is
a
beer
that
every
time
i
have
i
enjoy
more
it
just
keeps
getting
better
i
think
i
like
it
more
than
supplication
now
o
overall
an
excellent
beer
very
unique
and
a
must
try
for
fans
of
sours
wild
ales
and
unique
beers
in
general
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
didnt
wow
me
the
way
i
thought
it
would
still
for
an
american
wild
red
sour
ale
i
found
it
to
be
quite
pleasant
i
will
have
to
branch
out
and
try
the
other
wild
ales
russian
river
makes
because
both
supplication
and
consecration
were
very
unique
and
interesting
beers
overall
this
is
a
very
unusual
winelike
brew
that
takes
on
some
unfamiliarity
in
the
visual
department
but
makes
up
for
it
when
tasted
i
was
uneasy
but
now
satisfied
overalldrinkability
while
this
beer
was
better
then
many
of
the
other
sours
i
have
tried
it
still
just
is
not
my
thing
i
just
simply
dont
get
it
i
can
appreciate
the
complexity
and
strong
flavors
of
this
beer
but
to
me
these
are
just
super
hard
to
drink
i
mean
when
i
say
this
beer
is
sour
its
super
super
sour
like
lemonhead
sour
certainly
a
unique
experience
but
for
me
just
not
enjoyable
really
beyond
the
novelty
overall
sadly
consecration
suffers
from
the
same
woes
as
temptation
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
depth
of
flavour
that
belgian
sours
do
on
the
plus
side
this
is
certainly
the
most
drinkable
10
beer
i
have
had
i
will
consider
getting
another
bottle
of
consecration
in
the
future
maybe
a
year
or
two
of
age
will
bump
up
the
flavours
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
beer
mightve
been
too
young
and
i
dont
know
anything
about
aging
sours
or
the
style
in
general
its
not
too
harsh
or
intense
just
not
pleasant
to
me
gonna
stick
to
pte
for
now
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
any
insight
to
sours
is
welcome
through
beermail
im
certain
some
lovers
of
this
beer
andor
sours
will
report
this
review
much
like
my
review
of
thomas
hardys
old
ale
to
these
people
i
can
only
say
i
tried
to
be
openminded
and
enjoy
having
my
own
opinion
and
that
i
prefer
beer
to
wine
o
another
great
sour
beer
from
russian
river
perfect
blend
of
sour
tart
cherries
with
a
hint
of
wine
from
the
cabernet
sauvignon
bottles
consecration
is
classified
as
an
american
wild
ale
and
the
label
gives
hints
of
what
awaits
the
lucky
drinker
words
like
saccharomyces
pediococcus
brettanomyces
and
lactobacillus
hover
around
the
words
sour
ale
and
the
excitement
begins
to
build
add
all
that
to
the
fact
the
beer
is
aged
in
cabernet
sauvignon
barrels
and
you
realize
you
have
something
pretty
special
in
your
glass
consecration
pours
a
reddishbrown
yet
near
the
edges
appears
very
plum
like
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
that
fizzes
almost
like
soda
hugely
vinous
aromas
greet
the
drinker
including
notes
of
vanilla
oak
cabernet
sauvignon
and
earthy
hop
tonesfunk
the
pallet
erupts
in
an
orgy
of
flavors
with
the
initial
sourness
giving
way
to
darker
fruit
citrus
cabernet
notes
as
well
as
earthiness
horse
blanket
from
the
brettanomyces
the
fizziness
noticed
in
the
pour
sticks
around
for
the
entire
brew
a
sign
of
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
met
with
a
medium
body
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
both
because
of
the
abv
and
because
one
wants
to
keep
those
small
sips
coming
along
to
refresh
the
palate
and
give
it
a
chance
to
sort
out
the
complexity
this
is
not
a
subtle
beer
rather
it
grabs
your
taste
buds
and
wrestles
with
them
challenging
them
to
pick
up
and
identify
all
the
flavors
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
yet
another
winner
from
russian
river
and
im
glad
there
are
so
many
cabernet
barrels
in
ca
so
that
we
can
expect
to
see
this
one
again
and
again
the
sept
2012
bottle
pours
with
little
head
but
a
decent
ring
of
lace
atop
a
body
the
colour
of
american
mahogany
the
nose
leads
with
lactic
acid
wine
and
funk
and
is
balanced
by
the
smell
of
currants
when
you
take
a
sip
the
beer
explodes
with
a
lactic
sourness
rounded
by
the
oak
and
a
slight
astringency
from
the
tannins
currants
and
acrid
vinous
notes
hold
the
middle
leading
to
a
slightly
sweet
finish
with
lively
and
sparkling
carbonation
this
is
a
great
sour
m
good
amount
of
carbonation
dry
finish
medium
body
o
another
rr
sour
knocked
of
my
list
and
a
great
one
at
that
i
like
cabernet
wines
so
i
figured
i
would
like
this
and
it
came
through
this
is
a
style
im
just
getting
into
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
wild
sour
the
way
i
can
describe
it
is
its
like
drinking
a
glass
half
full
of
wine
and
half
beer
a
very
interesting
beer
overall
this
was
a
nice
treat
for
me
i
really
loved
the
flavor
profile
despite
it
being
fairly
one
noted
i
would
have
liked
to
sample
it
fresher
to
see
if
i
could
have
tasted
more
currants
or
some
actual
fruits
beyond
the
sourness
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
expecially
for
how
high
the
abv
is
on
this
beast
a
really
solid
sour
and
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
nothing
mindblowing
just
super
solid
owhat
a
wonderful
use
of
the
ingredients
truly
an
artisanal
beer
maybe
some
day
a
wizard
for
find
a
way
to
produce
this
cheap
and
plentiful
until
then
i
will
drink
as
much
of
this
as
i
can
i
love
the
way
this
thing
feels
its
not
belgian
but
its
damn
close
o
great
sipper
i
notice
alcohol
strength
in
my
throat
but
does
not
feel
like
it
in
my
mouth
due
to
its
dryness
this
beer
is
not
sessionable
d
vinous
complex
beer
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
solid
sour
ale
o
this
beer
is
extremely
impressive
the
tartness
and
fruity
notes
are
spot
on
its
not
overwhelming
at
all
to
date
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sours
overall
this
is
another
amazing
sour
by
russian
river
not
quite
as
good
as
supplication
but
a
very
close
second
overall
really
nice
sour
here
the
wine
is
great
ill
let
the
sour
beer
lovers
have
this
one
as
im
not
in
that
camp
seriously
this
beer
is
the
fn
best
thing
ever
the
pour
comes
out
the
same
shade
of
brown
as
the
bottles
label
it
reminds
me
of
root
beer
in
its
appearance
and
slight
carbonation
bubbles
steadily
rising
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
brett
funk
in
the
aroma
but
more
of
a
wine
aroma
a
friend
said
paint
stripper
i
said
thats
the
smell
of
awesome
i
cant
write
a
review
that
would
adequately
describe
the
taste
of
this
brew
or
do
it
any
justice
its
tart
sour
but
not
overly
so
your
mouth
waters
after
each
drink
begging
for
one
more
taste
it
has
the
perfect
balance
allowing
you
to
drink
this
endlessly
despite
being
a
heavyhitter
at
10
abv
you
do
not
taste
it
at
all
the
warmth
from
it
comes
through
but
that
is
it
consecration
finishes
with
an
dryness
that
finishes
its
statement
of
yes
you
are
drinking
the
most
epic
shit
ever
bottle
poured
a
hazy
reddish
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
oak
and
tart
notes
with
some
blackcurrant
notes
very
complex
taste
is
also
a
very
complex
mix
between
some
blackcurrant
some
tart
notes
and
some
pedio
with
light
sweet
figs
at
the
end
body
is
quite
full
for
style
with
good
carbonation
and
no
signs
of
alcohol
even
though
it
does
pack
quite
a
punch
very
well
done
o
this
is
a
pretty
complex
sour
ale
but
it
might
be
better
to
call
it
a
tart
ale
the
sourness
is
better
described
that
way
highly
recommended
to
try
really
like
the
balance
it
provides
a
refreshing
flavor
on
the
tongue
if
you
like
fruittartwoodwine
notes
in
a
beer
you
should
love
this
doa
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
well
disguised
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
sour
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
overall
an
interesting
beer
to
be
sure
and
the
only
barrel
aged
offering
from
russian
river
ive
ever
had
supplication
and
temptation
are
in
the
fridge
it
was
certainly
enjoyable
but
i
wasnt
really
blown
away
and
im
not
sure
if
id
be
willing
to
buy
it
online
again
and
eat
the
cost
of
shipping
now
if
i
lived
in
california
it
would
probably
be
a
different
story
overall
overwhelming
well
done
brew
strangely
addictive
the
more
rr
sours
i
have
the
more
i
want
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
that
it
is
somehow
a
hybrid
of
beerwine
champagne
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
brown
in
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
tart
dark
fruit
and
a
note
of
licorice
in
the
taste
dark
grapes
small
tartness
and
small
alcohol
notes
a
sour
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
grape
and
note
of
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
a
small
tartness
nice
alcohol
note
and
quite
wine
like
o
excellent
wild
ale
i
prefer
the
flavor
profile
of
supplication
but
i
have
no
complaints
about
this
whatsoever
and
will
have
it
whenever
i
can
awesome
fruity
vinous
flavors
with
a
pucker
and
an
alcoholic
punch
amazing
how
consistent
russian
river
can
make
an
availably
high
quality
sour
ale
like
this
one
they
never
disappoint
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
not
in
my
opinion
on
par
with
supplication
which
i
had
just
a
few
days
ago
but
it
is
definitely
a
great
example
of
sour
ales
and
something
i
would
pick
up
again
given
the
opportunity
despite
the
price
tag
of
13
for
375ml
poured
into
small
wine
glass
only
thing
available
from
375
ml
bottle
batch
007
this
is
my
first
review
as
a
member
so
pardon
my
inexperience
in
describing
the
beer
this
is
not
one
to
pound
down
definitely
a
sipper
the
cabernet
comes
through
strong
in
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
has
great
carbonation
sour
cherry
flavor
and
cabernet
flavors
followed
by
earthy
malt
taste
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
sour
ales
but
this
one
is
certainly
one
to
try
after
a
few
sips
i
was
hooked
very
pricey
but
if
you
want
something
out
of
the
ordinary
go
for
it
mo
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
and
just
freaking
delicious
this
is
the
best
example
of
a
wild
ale
i
have
had
poured
a
dark
amber
almost
ruby
red
with
minimal
head
and
very
little
lacing
beer
was
extremely
aromatic
and
immediately
noticeable
once
the
cork
was
removed
smells
of
a
yeasty
cabernet
wild
cherries
roasty
malts
and
oak
those
aroma
characteristics
were
consistent
with
the
flavor
of
the
brew
some
mild
tartiness
and
yeasy
flavors
a
medium
to
heavy
body
creamy
texture
and
light
carbonation
very
interesting
not
one
i
would
continue
to
pursue
due
to
personal
tastes
but
a
very
interesting
beer
to
sample
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
although
it
was
not
as
good
to
me
as
supplication
and
temptation
really
great
american
wild
from
vinnie
pretty
good
overall
the
bottle
lacks
carbonation
but
i
am
not
complianing
thats
a
reality
with
bottle
conditioned
beers
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
this
one
lower
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
might
age
my
other
bottle
for
a
few
years
o
this
is
a
style
that
i
am
still
developing
a
taste
for
and
this
is
the
first
one
that
i
have
truly
enjoyed
i
am
very
happy
tha
i
took
a
chance
on
this
one
o
another
check
mark
beside
the
rr
ion
beers
and
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
this
isnt
my
favorite
so
far
but
that
does
not
make
it
anything
short
of
spectacular
o
wild
ales
are
a
relatively
new
style
for
me
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
wine
barrel
aging
is
readily
apparent
here
and
it
really
makes
this
one
memorable
definitely
an
after
dinner
sipper
like
dessert
in
a
glass
if
there
were
one
nit
i
would
have
preferred
a
slightly
more
tart
finish
with
a
little
less
oak
presence
but
its
a
minor
nit
consecration
is
the
real
deal
cant
wait
to
try
more
rr
sours
o
very
enjoyable
american
wild
ale
this
ale
is
quite
carbonated
like
champagne
medium
body
but
heavy
with
10
alcohol
pours
mahogany
in
color
barely
opaque
and
no
head
smells
delicious
slightly
vinegar
tart
and
sweet
taste
is
a
blast
of
tart
and
and
mild
sweetness
a
little
vinegar
currants
and
slight
oak
all
balanced
perfectly
after
taste
is
all
oak
some
vanilla
and
currants
very
mild
overall
this
sour
beer
leaves
me
begging
for
another
sip
this
is
a
good
sour
and
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
high
abv
i
found
supplication
tastier
and
more
complex
though
with
noticeable
winebarrel
flavors
id
love
to
try
an
older
batch
of
consecration
o
another
great
brew
from
russian
river
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
the
rr
sours
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
the
wonderful
taste
combined
with
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
amazing
drinkability
make
this
an
excellent
sour
ale
still
having
trouble
putting
sour
reviews
into
words
i
know
i
like
em
though
very
clean
tasting
yes
o
better
than
my
first
wild
ale
but
im
starting
to
think
wild
ales
arent
my
thing
sharing
with
sour
beer
fan
friends
mike
n
bryce
homebrewers
poured
with
no
head
or
lace
color
is
a
hazycloudy
honey
amber
aroma
is
yeast
sour
oak
sherry
malt
flavors
similar
to
taste
but
not
as
complex
body
and
carbonation
are
perfect
for
style
finish
is
like
flavor
clean
balanced
and
a
nice
alcohol
prod
very
nice
the
sour
components
of
this
have
stepped
up
with
some
age
on
it
but
it
is
still
a
fantastic
beer
i
feel
so
spoiled
sitting
here
and
ordering
another
pour
im
eternally
jealous
of
you
locals
who
can
enjoy
this
every
day
o
i
seriously
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
it
would
after
sharing
this
one
with
some
family
i
think
ill
come
back
to
this
one
again
soon
this
was
my
first
sour
experience
and
it
tasted
like
liquid
warheads
couldnt
appreciate
it
skål
o
another
home
run
from
rr
extremely
drinkable
and
i
never
would
have
guessed
that
this
brew
was
10
abv
this
will
join
supplication
on
my
constant
wants
gotta
love
that
classic
in
your
face
russian
river
sourness
a
very
solid
wild
that
i
would
never
turn
down
but
perhaps
not
the
best
amongst
all
the
rr
sours
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
every
day
but
definitely
worth
revisiting
once
in
a
while
o
looks
like
another
winner
from
russian
river
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
personal
taste
i
prefer
the
more
delicate
temptation
and
sanctification
with
that
said
this
is
still
a
phenomenal
brew
o
infinitely
drinkable
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
where
these
abvs
are
hiding
looked
down
and
it
was
already
half
gone
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
because
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
d
im
new
to
sours
and
this
was
the
first
one
that
i
actually
enjoyed
it
has
a
wonderful
array
of
flavors
backed
by
a
nice
sour
funkiness
the
high
alcohol
content
is
hardly
noticeable
making
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
the
taste
seems
to
only
get
better
as
it
warms
overall
an
excellent
offering
from
russian
river
and
so
far
my
favorite
sour
bottle
to
tulip
smells
good
like
a
strong
ale
should
tastes
fantastic
i
love
the
cabernet
influence
does
wonders
for
the
flavor
complex
but
not
in
a
i
taste
plums
cherries
and
earthiness
etc
kind
of
way
like
youd
get
from
wine
snobs
just
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
great
what
looks
to
be
relatively
lowcarbonated
is
actually
deceptively
carbonated
just
as
a
sour
should
be
overall
a
great
beer
that
ill
definitely
be
seeking
out
again
10
abv
is
very
well
masked
if
i
had
to
guess
i
would
have
thought
it
was
around
6
sour
beers
tend
to
really
cover
up
any
alcohol
taste
enjoyable
but
at
15
for
a
375
its
hard
to
justify
the
price
i
can
get
a
six
pack
of
a
very
comparable
sour
for
around
the
same
price
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
amberred
color
the
aroma
is
a
tarty
fruit
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
this
beer
has
an
amazing
taste
to
it
it
has
a
sweet
and
tarty
fruit
taste
to
it
i
think
its
more
tart
than
sour
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
whole
750
bottle
to
myself
i
have
only
tried
a
few
of
the
russian
river
offerings
todate
but
would
definitely
seek
this
out
again
fantastic
stuff
this
is
a
wonderful
sour
i
tried
it
first
at
rrs
brewery
and
it
was
too
much
for
a
first
timer
after
some
oude
bruins
the
sour
flavor
has
grown
on
me
and
now
i
can
fully
appreciate
the
more
potent
sours
this
is
flavorful
and
complex
the
sourness
is
in
perfect
equilibrium
with
the
amount
of
flavor
in
this
beer
all
that
in
a
10
beer
that
doesnt
taste
alcoholic
at
all
a
must
try
but
dont
dive
into
this
expensive
treat
until
youve
tried
a
couple
other
sours
because
some
context
really
makes
you
appreciate
it
better
overall
not
as
sour
or
flavorful
as
new
belgiums
la
folie
but
better
than
most
other
sours
ive
had
especially
given
that
it
doesnt
cost
near
as
much
as
la
folie
a
complex
blend
of
fruity
flavors
but
maybe
a
bit
too
sour
as
its
a
tad
over
powering
definitely
a
contender
for
one
of
my
favorites
probably
not
something
ill
come
back
to
in
the
near
future
but
i
can
see
the
appeal
and
appreciate
the
quality
that
russian
river
puts
out
o
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
cant
believe
i
have
left
sitting
on
the
shelves
all
these
times
i
have
always
been
skeptical
of
the
price
for
these
but
now
i
know
they
are
the
real
deal
will
be
coming
back
multiple
times
for
this
o
completely
awesome
i
love
how
the
wine
barrel
aging
really
played
a
part
overall
a
hell
of
a
sour
of
the
few
dozen
or
so
different
wild
ales
ive
sampled
this
is
on
a
very
short
list
for
overall
best
neck
and
neck
with
temptation
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
w
a
sliver
of
a
head
on
it
it
looks
very
similar
to
a
glass
of
wine
or
a
port
head
is
gone
within
10
seconds
small
amount
of
lacing
on
my
glass
not
much
there
at
all
nose
is
wonderfully
complex
wine
port
berries
funk
sweetness
some
yeast
all
in
there
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
and
airs
out
zero
alcohol
in
the
nose
i
have
a
feeling
im
really
going
to
like
this
one
taste
is
equally
good
sour
but
not
overly
so
all
the
smells
really
come
out
and
the
flavor
just
blows
my
taste
buds
out
of
the
water
cherries
and
some
oak
come
out
as
the
beer
opens
up
this
is
a
very
tasty
wild
ale
and
i
cant
believe
that
its
10
abv
mouthfeel
is
medium
w
good
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
almost
a
winelike
dry
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
would
buy
this
one
again
in
a
heartbeat
cheers
o
complex
but
i
feel
my
sour
taste
buds
just
havent
developed
as
of
yet
comes
off
a
little
bit
harsh
and
is
focused
more
on
red
wine
flavors
i
do
enjoy
some
of
the
flavors
though
especially
the
woodiness
and
the
tobacco
in
the
finish
the
nose
smells
absolutely
phenomenal
i
will
respect
it
for
what
it
is
o
this
is
a
delicious
and
well
balanced
wild
ale
the
10
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
range
of
flavors
is
vast
definitely
worth
a
try
o
fantastic
beer
a
o
really
nice
all
over
looks
and
tastes
great
wish
this
was
on
shelves
around
here
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
always
pick
up
a
bottle
to
enjoy
whenever
i
can
d
very
sour
to
the
point
where
it
compromises
drinkability
that
being
said
its
got
a
ton
of
character
im
curious
to
see
how
age
affects
this
dr
it
hides
its
abv
very
well
and
has
some
great
complex
flavours
but
does
suffer
from
some
minor
issues
namely
overcarbonation
i
could
see
this
getting
better
with
age
but
itd
be
very
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
its
nice
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
after
returning
from
work
but
sippers
only
go
so
far
excellent
value
in
california
d
really
excellent
i
like
it
even
better
than
when
i
first
had
it
ontap
at
the
rr
brew
pub
as
ive
learned
to
betterappreciate
this
style
we
really
enjoyed
this
ale
the
label
does
not
mention
that
is
a
sour
but
it
turned
out
to
be
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
poured
a
rich
burgundy
color
with
a
faint
aroma
of
currants
the
sourness
is
very
refreshing
currents
and
rich
cabernet
wine
flavor
is
evident
from
the
start
the
flavor
grows
more
complex
as
the
beer
warms
adding
hints
of
tobacco
and
figs
o
another
great
wild
ale
from
russian
river
i
have
been
lucky
enough
to
have
multiple
vintages
of
consecration
i
am
partial
to
the
earlier
batches
of
this
beer
batches
1
and
2
being
my
favorites
later
batches
are
very
similar
but
dont
seem
to
have
the
same
levels
of
oak
and
fruit
flavor
o
one
of
the
best
american
sours
bar
none
give
me
another
pint
overall
its
awesome
and
a
good
drinker
you
dont
know
its
10
abv
at
all
while
you
drink
it
o
delicious
such
a
complex
funk
poured
from
bottle
into
rr
tulip
the
color
is
a
rich
burgundy
with
just
a
faint
head
with
faint
lacing
very
effervescent
and
bubbly
can
taste
the
wine
and
sweetness
easy
to
drink
with
each
drink
changing
slightly
slight
tartness
with
an
after
taste
of
sweetness
probably
my
favorite
tion
beer
will
continue
to
seek
this
one
out
12
oz
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
rich
mahogonyruby
color
more
or
less
clear
and
a
small
fizzy
head
forms
and
crackles
away
aroma
is
big
and
wine
like
alittle
alcohol
peaks
through
and
then
theres
the
funk
which
all
make
for
a
complex
nose
in
the
taste
almost
sweet
and
sour
with
grape
notes
oaky
tannins
bitter
brett
offering
a
strong
sour
and
alcohol
is
almost
unnoticed
malt
body
is
more
or
less
overrun
by
these
strong
flavors
but
there
is
a
light
touch
of
caramel
its
all
about
the
lovely
sour
in
this
beer
though
and
the
delicate
flavor
of
currents
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
semi
dry
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
and
i
wish
i
could
get
it
all
the
time
with
a
reasonable
price
tag
mighty
fine
o
i
like
sours
so
far
but
i
dont
think
i
was
ready
for
this
one
mouthfeel
silky
smooth
a
bit
sugary
carbonation
is
funny
thought
it
might
be
overcarbonated
but
if
anything
its
under
body
is
dead
on
cheers
an
alltime
favorite
of
mine
pour
is
a
murky
brown
color
glows
in
the
light
slight
haze
to
it
head
is
pithy
and
large
bubble
doesnt
generate
much
looks
very
oily
and
slick
aromas
are
of
soured
grapes
and
dark
fruit
a
hint
of
oak
woodiness
can
be
found
but
the
buggies
really
jump
out
at
you
flavor
is
mellow
and
soft
bunches
of
sour
fruits
and
a
mellow
caramell
oak
nuttiness
to
the
finish
warming
on
the
palate
the
body
doesnt
lend
itself
to
the
abv
but
the
finish
reveals
a
little
heat
once
warmed
very
nice
brew
mellow
perfect
sour
level
and
nice
funk
to
it
overall
interesting
sour
beer
not
my
favorite
sour
we
had
that
night
but
its
decent
o
its
sour
alright
not
my
favorite
rr
sour
still
love
me
that
temptation
i
will
say
that
the
avb
is
really
well
hidden
this
is
ffo
flemish
reds
overall
a
very
good
beer
it
looks
great
smells
great
and
tastes
good
with
just
a
small
astringency
problem
which
comes
from
the
use
of
barrels
and
bugs
a
great
effort
by
rr
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
sours
if
and
when
i
make
it
to
california
o
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
easily
available
sour
tion
beers
supplication
sanctification
temptation
a
sour
beer
for
red
wine
lovers
o
this
particular
beer
confused
me
more
than
anything
granted
ive
not
had
much
experience
with
sours
to
date
but
i
still
imagine
this
has
greater
depth
than
most
id
say
its
sourness
in
taste
overpowered
some
of
the
darker
fruits
that
the
scent
gives
off
and
the
final
product
ends
up
tasting
a
bit
like
a
carbonated
grapefruit
juice
without
any
sweetener
but
there
is
much
more
here
as
it
warmed
i
felt
that
the
malt
i
detected
in
the
nose
came
out
a
bit
more
but
the
yeastiness
was
seemingly
lost
in
the
sour
i
enjoyed
this
and
have
a
bottle
in
the
cellar
that
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
in
a
years
time
to
see
how
it
changed
o
one
of
my
favorite
russian
river
brews
the
wonderful
meritage
of
sour
tart
currants
coupled
with
the
complexity
of
the
oak
and
cabernet
make
for
a
very
enjoyable
sour
experience
highly
recommended
poured
a
glorious
garnet
red
color
with
no
head
at
all
no
lacing
smells
like
a
sweet
red
wine
and
fruit
tastes
like
currants
the
sweetness
of
the
candy
like
currants
balances
well
with
the
sour
tart
dryness
tastes
like
cinnamon
closest
thing
ive
had
to
a
sour
red
wine
little
carbonation
medium
feel
brilliant
d
this
is
a
fruity
and
tart
wild
ale
but
with
a
lot
of
dry
thick
malt
and
enough
funk
to
keep
it
interesting
my
favorite
sour
from
rrs
regular
lineup
big
but
not
brash
simultaneously
overthetop
in
flavor
yet
somehow
restrained
this
is
fantastic
i
would
love
to
see
the
funk
develop
in
an
older
bottle
but
alas
im
an
impatient
man
overall
aroma
and
taste
are
matched
incredibly
well
no
doubt
that
this
beer
genre
is
dominated
by
russian
river
taste
was
dried
fruit
like
cherries
and
currents
also
got
cranberry
and
red
grape
the
oak
flavor
that
was
so
strong
in
the
smell
is
much
more
subdued
in
the
taste
there
is
a
slight
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
but
it
is
surprisingly
not
noticeable
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
tingly
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
the
beer
was
tart
but
not
overpuckeringly
so
o
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
and
really
hit
the
mark
with
all
the
flavors
the
most
surprising
thing
is
that
the
alcohol
is
almost
totally
undetectable
great
beer
beautiful
must
try
o
delicious
its
hard
to
really
explain
it
since
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
beer
and
more
like
champagne
seriously
you
have
to
try
this
one
incredible
overall
impression
a
very
straight
forward
wildsour
pleasant
nice
cherry
tastearoma
and
well
balanced
i
am
excited
i
got
to
try
these
two
rr
brews
najas
and
will
be
keeping
my
fingers
crossed
to
enjoy
many
more
in
the
future
overall
a
very
nice
beer
bit
high
in
the
alcohol
but
still
dangerously
drinkable
i
prefer
the
puckering
funky
sourness
of
the
belgium
wilds
though
ocould
be
slightly
more
balanced
but
it
is
still
a
great
beer
it
was
my
first
sour
as
a
heads
up
looking
forward
to
trying
more
d
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
those
but
this
is
definitely
the
most
interesting
sour
beer
i
have
had
i
think
i
prefer
the
sessionable
enjoyability
of
supplication
we
had
both
of
these
backtoback
in
a
recent
sour
tasting
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
brown
actually
reminds
me
a
lot
of
cocacola
especially
the
way
the
off
white
head
fizzes
up
and
then
dissipates
aroma
is
amazing
very
complex
for
any
beer
it
shares
some
aromas
with
cabernet
which
is
not
surprising
given
that
this
beer
is
aged
in
cab
barrels
black
currants
red
fruit
vanilla
cola
and
tobacco
all
come
to
mind
this
beer
has
a
moderate
sourness
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
and
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
i
read
biegamans
review
mentioning
that
he
associated
the
bitterness
with
tomato
and
although
i
dont
get
that
specifically
i
will
say
that
it
has
a
certain
umami
quality
that
is
usually
associated
with
tomatoes
so
i
could
see
the
comparison
overall
this
is
a
very
good
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
i
think
it
has
amazing
complexity
that
is
best
enjoyed
over
a
long
period
of
time
letting
the
beer
warm
a
bit
and
change
over
and
hour
or
two
consecration
is
an
artistic
and
innovative
experiment
that
for
all
its
intricacies
and
inventiveness
ends
up
tasting
a
lot
like
watereddown
cab
sauvignon
what
to
make
of
that
it
blurs
the
lines
not
only
of
the
beerwine
world
but
of
the
perspectives
of
the
reviewer
too
11
is
a
lot
for
a
bottle
of
any
beer
but
at
23
this
would
make
a
reasonably
priced
bottle
of
wine
i
suppose
for
me
personally
that
makes
it
more
a
novelty
thing
than
anything
else
o
amazing
beer
very
complex
sour
but
not
lose
your
lips
puckering
clean
sourness
lots
of
wine
attributes
would
love
to
have
another
especially
with
a
lot
more
age
on
it
o
offering
up
a
wonderful
blend
of
flavors
i
found
this
beer
to
be
sour
tannic
and
complex
very
good
appearance
is
reddish
brown
with
very
little
head
the
nose
has
grapes
black
currants
cherry
and
a
tart
quality
its
taste
is
sour
red
wine
lemon
and
is
also
sweet
a
nice
mix
of
different
flavors
are
here
mf
is
medium
with
not
very
much
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
wildsour
beer
which
lived
up
to
its
solid
reputation
i
actually
had
a
sample
of
this
on
draught
a
while
back
and
didnt
like
it
im
glad
i
gave
this
bottle
with
its
hefty
price
tag
a
chance
o
awesome
sour
one
of
the
best
and
certainly
very
consistent
o
a
good
american
wild
ale
that
is
quite
tart
i
preferred
supplication
though
another
classic
from
russian
river
worth
trading
for
or
paying
its
hefty
price
tag
excellent
really
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
on
par
with
tempation
and
supplication
maybe
a
little
behind
definitely
has
a
more
tannin
and
red
vinegar
note
but
great
overall
o
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
this
wasnt
the
strongest
showing
i
wish
i
had
made
note
of
the
batch
as
it
was
really
quite
a
bit
more
acidic
than
i
ever
had
before
this
was
my
first
time
out
of
the
bottle
but
even
then
the
youth
of
the
wood
and
harshness
of
young
currents
pillaged
the
palate
this
beer
is
much
better
in
different
batches
but
i
would
say
that
the
taste
character
is
fairly
the
same
there
was
a
bit
more
limevinegar
than
id
like
as
the
flavors
are
already
acidic
and
bold
enough
by
no
means
a
crap
or
unexciting
beer
but
i
dreamed
of
acidic
remedies
after
this
one
enjoyed
this
at
a
barrel
aged
tasting
on
20110806
alongside
a
sanctification
temptation
supplication
and
consecration
my
opinions
were
exactly
what
i
felt
on
my
first
taste
of
this
fine
beer
ogets
more
complex
as
i
drink
this
its
definitely
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
wild
its
very
easy
drinking
considering
the
high
abv
there
is
no
warming
which
is
nice
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
amazing
beer
russian
river
proves
to
be
the
best
american
sour
producer
there
is
with
ever
sour
they
make
consecration
is
an
amazingly
well
crafted
beer
and
vinnie
has
one
of
the
greatest
palates
ever
to
be
able
to
taste
this
beer
out
of
the
barrel
and
know
whether
it
is
time
to
bottle
it
yet
consecration
blows
my
mind
every
time
i
drink
a
bottle
ooverall
i
liked
this
but
it
was
prob
my
least
favorite
of
all
the
wild
ales
by
rr
it
was
nice
a
tart
but
didnt
have
a
ton
going
on
in
the
beer
def
try
this
one
but
i
will
not
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
o
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
its
not
on
par
with
the
belgian
sours
but
this
is
a
very
impressive
american
wild
it
was
my
first
rrion
beer
and
from
what
i
read
this
is
the
bottom
of
the
tier
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
ones
overall
my
least
favorite
among
the
bunch
and
only
because
the
base
beer
and
fruit
seem
to
have
lost
to
sourness
funk
did
too
many
cooks
bugs
ruin
the
broth
3
55
overall
a
spectacular
showcase
of
rrs
ability
to
make
a
funky
sour
beer
o
i
pretty
much
love
everything
these
guys
do
im
not
gonna
lie
o
d
a
pretty
good
beer
id
say
with
preference
going
to
batch
005
overall
never
had
a
beer
like
this
truly
unique
for
a
sour
beer
thanks
again
to
ken
for
bringing
this
one
to
a
recent
tasting
poured
a
clear
copper
color
topped
with
a
light
white
head
aromas
of
funk
plums
currants
and
vinegar
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
to
medium
bodied
and
tart
with
flavors
of
red
wine
vinegar
currents
and
wine
overall
both
are
great
i
think
i
like
the
batch
5
a
touch
better
because
of
the
thickness
of
it
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
im
working
to
appreciate
thanks

here
the
flavors
are
refreshingly
tart
and
the
alcohol
seems
nonexistent
despite
the
10
abv
indicated
on
the
label
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
carbonation
that
falls
just
short
of
lively
the
tartness
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
along
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
and
there
is
also
a
slight
acidic
burn
that
lingers
on
the
lips
between
quaffs

much
more
to
say
a
solid
american
wild

a
great
deal

impressive
beer
from
this
brewer
pours
a
deep
amber
red
off
the
of

the
head
dissipates
almost
immediately
the
smell
is
that
deep
funk
that
we
have
all
come
to
love
with
wild
ales
a
bit
of
cherry
comes
off
the
nose
also
taste
is
a
mouth
puckering
sour
with
loads
of
tart
cherry
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
playful
but
not
flat
by
any
means
quite
and
exceptional
beer
from
an
exceptional
brewery
ill
edit
tthis
to
state
that
this
beer
doesnt
age
particularly
well
in
my
experience
but
is
fantastic
fresh
o
very
delicious
sour
from
russian
river
very
easy
drinkability
for
how
high
the
abv
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
sours
released
from

but
still
very
enjoyable
quality
beer
that
i
hope
to
be
drinking
again

this
beer
pours

is
slightly
funky
and
fruity
with
a
definite
sourness

it
the
taste
is
very
sour
with
a
definite
fruit
flavor
that
i
assume
is
the
currants
thought
i
have
never
had
a
currant
and
do
not
know
what
they
taste
like
the
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
heavy
not
that
it
was
sweet
but
there
seemed
to
be
something
about
the
beer
that
was
fuller
than
most
other

i
have
had
overall
this
is
a
good

would
drink
it

that
should
be
experienced
before
you

a
very
good

another
great

im
getting
stinkeye
from

on
this
one
maybe
rightfully
so
last
i
checked
though
i
dont
get
mad
if
you
dislike
the

or
stout
in
your
glass
o
lots
of
sourness
the
one
i
had
a
dld
didnt
seem
to
be
as
sour
but
has
some
age
on
it
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
another
bottle
of
this
in
the
same
night
always
fascinated
with
sours
like
this
try
to
pull
out
more
flavors
this
one
was
tough
to
do
though
o
ive
been
slowly
getting
myself
into
sour
beers
and
this
one
was
a
nice
one
great
representative
of
the
style
but
a
sipper
nonetheless
i
can
only
handle
one
bottle
at
a
time
more
mild
then
some
of
the
sours
ive
had
which
made
this
one
more
enjoyable
for
me
d
this
was
a
highly
complex
beer
that
was
delicate
but
powerful
the
scent
and
taste
and
body
were
all
awesome
it
wasnt
overly
puckering
either
and
the
alcohol
was
undetectable
scary
so
this
was
very
inviting
to
continue
drinking
could
be
aged
for
a
long
time
but
very
nice
fresh
an
excellent
sipping
wild
ale
which
i
might
enjoy
over
other
russian
rivers
due
to
its
depth
and
balance
o
this
beer
is
unlike
anything
i
have
had
before
the
wine
characteristics
were
so
prominent
and
the
sourness
and
acidity
of
the
beer
made
this
a
very
tasty
and
memorable
beer
this
is
the
first
beer
my
wife
has
ever
enjoyed
too
so
i
was
pretty
impressed
d
amazing
by
far
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
for
17
for
a
375ml
it
was
totally
worth
it
thank
you
russian
river
375ml
bottle
batch
5
it
was
acquired
in
a
recent
trade
with
brewerb
thanks
again
brian
this
beer
pours
a
fig
like
brown
with
reddishpurple
highlights
and
an
off
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
it
smells
of
tart
cherries
currants
grape
skins
and
moderate
brett
funk
it
tastes
sour
cherries
tree
bark
tannins
brett
and
light
alcohol
it
drinks
medium
in
body
for
a
wild
with
a
moderate
amount
of
alcohol
but
for
10
it
is
well
hidden
it
has
a
sharp
dry
finish
overall
this
is
definitely
a
fine
beer
but
certainly
not
the
best
ive
had
to
date
rating
94
out
of
100
not
as
good
as
supplication
or
temptation
but
extremely
solid
o
not
my
favorite
from
russian
river
but
a
nice
beer
overall
still
overall
anyone
could
drink
this
forever
excellent
beer
great
sourness
excellent
beer
flavors
are
a
bit
more
layered
than
what
i
expected
retains
the
flavor
of
the
base
beer
quite
well
the
higher
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
10
abv
is
barely
noticed
this
is
just
another
reason
i
wish
i
had
access
to
russian
river
outstanding
beer
from
a
world
class
brewery
drinking
batch
001x4
this
is
like
a
whole
new
beast
and
its
amazing
im
tempted
to
upgrade
my
ratings
here
which
are
already
stellar
but
i
guess
thats
not
fair
this
is
the
definition
of
epic
a
bit
disappointing
and
one
dimensional
after
supplication
not
sure
if
there
is
a
recommended
drinking
temp
for
this
style
but
a
bit
more
sour
kick
comes
through
as
it
warms
and
it
gets
more
of
an
overall
presence
which
helps
define
the
beer
would
like
to
try
another
bottle
some
day
as
this
ones
now
gone
enjoyable
but
didnt
leave
much
of
an
impression
drinkability
a
delicious
and
complex
sipper
the
sour
is
assertive
but
not
overbearing
as
is
the
wine
flavor
as
i
said
before
i
thought
supplication
was
to
winey
this
one
is
just
right
yet
again
a
solid
offering
from
rr
d
i
love
rr
sours
and
initially
this
was
my
favorite
seems
like
a
fair
amount
of
batch
variation
with
consecration
but
nonetheless
a
great
beer
by
rr
i
openly
challenge
anyone
and
everyone
to
do
a
blind
tasting
of
these
beers
they
are
interesting
in
their
own
way
but
all
i
see
them
as
is
a
vessel
to
deliver
the
bitter
strain
of
yeast
that
they
have
in
common
this
beer
is
nothing
more
than
sour
you
cannot
taste
the
currants
or
anything
rr
cornered
the
dipa
tipa
market
with
the
plinys
and
is
in
search
of
a
new
thing
unfortunately
it
does
not
deliver
these
beers
are
nothing
more
than
sour
overall
this
is
just
great
and
i
am
going
to
stop
writing
now
and
just
enjoy
it
while
it
lasts
good
rr
good
job
375
of
awesomeness
pours
a
reddish
brown
only
slightly
hazed
1
finger
head
that
doesnt
stay
long
aromas
of
red
wine
and
oak
and
so
much
more
taste
is
tart
with
the
oak
and
red
wine
notes
slight
vinegar
aroma
overall
another
very
tasty
sour
one
of
the
best
ive
had
after
all
the
hype
including
the
price
i
was
unimpressed
i
was
expecting
an
eyeopening
sour
experience
and
i
got
what
i
consider
an
average
experience
maybe
some
more
aging
would
have
improved
it
i
dont
know
just
underwhelming
all
around
d
this
beer
is
sour
of
course
but
it
is
a
very
easy
drink
unlike
other
sours
out
there
the
10
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
drink
and
overall
i
gotta
knock
the
appearance
for
lack
of
carbonation
i
expected
a
little
more
head
and
therefore
more
nose
it
was
wonderful
but
i
will
update
if
i
taste
again
with
different
reaults
d
i
was
happy
to
finally
try
a
beer
from
russian
river
and
im
starting
to
get
used
to
trying
wild
ales
the
tartness
level
in
this
one
was
apparent
from
the
first
sniff
and
very
apparent
as
you
swallow
i
liked
trying
a
dried
currant
along
side
because
it
really
helped
me
pinpoint
the
currant
flavor
in
the
beer
again
a
big
thanks
to
deuane
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
cheers
d
this
beer
showcases
to
me
why
rr
is
considered
one
of
the
top
if
not
the
top
wild
ale
producer
in
north
america
really
nice
complexity
that
makes
this
stand
out
from
some
of
the
other
sours
wilds
i
have
tried
i
am
going
to
have
to
get
some
more
of
this
one
for
sure
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
its
a
deep
garnet
red
with
just
a
wisp
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
like
soda
bubbles
the
effervescence
carries
a
lot
wine
notes
black
peppery
damp
oak
crushed
and
blackberries
with
just
a
whiff
of
earthy
funk
the
acid
and
alcohol
and
definitely
present
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palette
the
wine
notes
dominate
with
big
fruitiness
leather
tobacco
and
a
dry
tannic
oak
finish
the
currants
add
a
bit
of
jammy
creamy
fruit
the
finish
is
boozy
with
just
a
slightly
tart
and
minerally
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
lingering
funk
that
coats
your
tongue
very
tasty
and
complex
great
beer
thanks
vinnie
for
making
this
o
damn
good
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
gotten
easy
enough
to
get
around
here
that
its
no
longer
the
treat
that
it
used
to
be
o
very
impressed
this
being
my
first
russian
river
wild
ale
i
was
expecting
a
great
funky
beer
and
came
away
with
just
that
a
perfect
send
off
beer
for
my
best
friend
emmaus217
good
luck
man
md
very
little
carbonation
medium
body
fruity
and
sour
i
drank
this
after
a
cantillon
rose
de
gambrinus
and
i
knew
this
was
good
but
it
was
tough
for
the
consecration
to
follow
the
cantillon
o
excellent
sour
i
prefer
the
supplication
series
but
this
is
a
close
second
from
rr
good
job
again
vin
o
solid
sour
ale
tastes
great
but
i
would
drink
a
supplication
over
this
any
day
the
currants
add
a
nice
unique
flavor
to
compliment
the
sourness
and
sweet
fruit
drinks
really
well
for
a
10
abv
ale
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
this
would
go
great
with
grilled
goat
cheese
filled
mushrooms
this
pours
out
as
a
pretty
nice
wine
like
amber
red
color
the
head
vanishes
quickly
after
the
pour
and
just
leaves
a
thing
white
film
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
super
tart
smelling
very
acidic
like
vinegar
the
taste
is
of
sour
cherry
and
stomach
acid
similar
to
a
geuze
lambic
the
after
taste
leaves
a
dry
mouthfeel
in
the
back
of
your
tongue
it
makes
you
want
another
sip
but
since
im
not
into
this
style
too
much
its
almost
unwanted
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
a
red
wine
in
my
opinion
its
an
awesome
beer
for
those
who
like
the
wild
sour
ales
but
its
just
not
for
me
one
of
the
top
wild
ales
in
the
world
i
like
some
of
the
other
russian
river
wilds
better
i
e
supplication
compunction
but
this
one
is
still
very
good
poured
into
a
rr
belgian
chalice
glass
seemed
fitting
garnet
body
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
rapidly
fizzy
away
quickly
aroma
is
filled
with
oak
red
wine
notes
cherries
plums
grapes
very
barnyardlike
funky
aroma
flavor
is
bracingly
sour
funky
and
oaky
the
sweet
fruity
characteristics
really
shine
in
the
flavor
as
well
finishes
bone
dry
with
a
mouthwatering
astringency
bubblyprickly
on
the
tongue
with
a
rather
light
body
to
top
everything
off
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
making
this
one
incredibly
drinkable
brew
russian
river
knows
how
to
make
beer
overall
alright
but
sort
of
pedestrian
feels
like
a
food
beer
than
for
casual
drinking
for
me
it
will
do
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
definitely
medium
bodied
but
is
lacking
a
bit
of
carbonation
for
my
taste
fairly
low
for
the
style
but
still
good
overall
a
good
wild
ale
that
really
satisfies
if
youre
looking
for
something
sour
i
wish
the
other
aspects
of
this
beer
were
as
good
as
the
taste
because
it
is
good
mouthfeel
is
thin
a
little
filmy
overall
im
enjoying
this
more
than
the
sanctification
in
the
other
glass
as
a
whole
this
beer
is
amazing
will
probably
drink
again
as
a
special
occasion
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
have
this
on
three
separate
occasions
once
at
gabf
and
twice
at
home
with
some
bottles
i
was
able
to
find
while
out
there
the
beer
at
first
is
unassuming
it
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
mahogany
with
a
small
tiny
head
then
you
smell
it
smell
is
oaked
funk
very
sour
with
a
sufficiently
huge
aroma
first
taste
is
an
explosion
on
the
tongue
with
a
huge
sour
note
exploding
outwards
midway
through
the
first
taste
wow
thats
really
all
i
can
say
must
be
tasted
to
be
believed
the
standard
bearer
for
sour
beers
pliny
gets
all
the
press
but
this
beer
deserves
all
the
accolades
and
more
most
assuredly
up
there
with
my
favorites
of
all
time
overall
this
is
only
my
second
sour
ever
and
i
enjoyed
it
quit
a
bit
i
have
another
in
the
celler
interested
to
see
what
age
does
to
it
try
this
if
you
have
not
tried
it
yet
md
crisp
and
dry
like
a
fine
wine
never
had
that
from
a
beer
all
this
blends
together
well
and
creates
one
very
drinkable
beer
overall
i
havent
found
a
sour
beer
that
i
like
better
than
this
one
the
flavors
are
so
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
isnt
anywhere
to
be
found
very
smooth
d
this
is
a
great
beer
but
not
as
good
as
fresher
batches
imo
aroma
is
very
sour
with
notes
of
fruit
the
appearance
is
a
brandy
color
with
red
hints
coming
through
the
taste
is
sour
but
in
the
best
way
possible
it
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
winebarrel
aged
beer
my
favorite
sour
ale
at
the
moment
by
far
hopefully
my
local
store
will
have
some
more
soon
russian
river
brewing
really
has
their
act
together
with
a
great
variety
of
top
notch
beers
coming
out
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
cheers
o
this
is
the
best
sour
i
have
ever
had
the
complexity
is
overwhelming
this
is
so
masterfully
crafted
that
it
rivals
the
finest
bordeaux
blends
this
should
be
on
every
beer
lovers
bucket
list
d
a
great
sour
that
is
pretty
dry
this
was
my
first
sour
which
i
was
excited
about
and
scared
about
if
i
would
like
it
cant
wait
to
try
more
sours
mouthfeel
drinkability
my
initial
response
after
my
first
drink
was
that
this
was
a
heavybodied
beer
but
it
soon
mellowed
out
to
be
pretty
averagemedium
bodied
sour
and
tart
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
heavy
carbonation
becomes
clear
upon
my
first
drink
slight
sourness
left
on
the
lips
nice
to
sip
and
enjoy
ethanol
is
hidden
quite
well
but
stands
out
at
times
i
think
i
would
prefer
sanctification
over
this
one
o
this
was
wonderful
very
glad
i
tried
it
again
4
5
d
this
is
an
amazing
sour
the
barrel
aging
in
cabernet
barrels
with
currents
truly
gives
you
a
puckering
affect
thats
sour
and
tart
from
start
to
finish
this
isnt
over
done
on
sour
instead
is
incredibly
balanced
for
how
intense
and
big
this
beer
is
i
could
drink
this
one
again
rr
is
more
of
a
pain
to
get
and
i
have
a
supplication
temptation
and
sanctification
waiting
in
the
wings
it
will
be
interesting
to
compare
this
more
commonly
available
rr
sour
to
a
couple
that
tend
to
be
a
little
more
hard
to
get
especially
to
me
it
pours
a
rather
nice
looking
grape
juice
colored
reddish
purple
color
with
a
fairly
small
off
white
head
with
no
lacing
smells
of
black
currants
cherry
horse
blanket
and
a
little
funk
tastes
of
black
currants
cherry
brett
sourness
funky
yeast
oak
aging
and
tons
of
mouth
puckering
goodness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
heavy
carbonation
and
a
crisp
feel
overall
it
is
absolutely
awesome
drinkability
probably
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
very
pungent
but
also
very
drinkable
oone
of
the
best
sours
to
come
out
of
russian
river
i
could
see
this
going
another
2
years
at
least
overall
an
excellent
beer
uncomplicated
enjoyable
flavor
with
just
the
right
number
and
combination
of
notes
to
hold
your
interest
without
being
pretentious
or
muddled
overall
the
lesser
of
all
the
rr
sours
but
still
not
bad
price
was
22
a
bomber
batch
3
which
is
much
lower
than
prices
for
others
overall
the
best
wild
alesour
i
have
ever
tasted
one
of
my
go
to
sours
that
im
finally
reviewing
consecration
noun
the
act
of
dedication
to
the
worship
and
service
of
a
deity
it
would
be
blasphemy
to
suggest
that
vinnie
is
a
deity
so
how
about
craft
brewing
god
bottom
line
this
outstanding
elixir
is
another
in
a
long
line
of
outstanding
tion
beer
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
this
or
any
country
halfway
in
its
getting
deep
plummier
richer
moreover
im
more
impresseder
for
sure
deeeelicious
mmmm
mmm
mm
m
d
definitely
a
great
sour
a
bit
drier
then
most
i
think
i
prefer
supplication
though
due
to
a
bigger
fruit
presence
d
as
good
as
it
is
i
dont
know
how
many
id
want
to
drink
not
to
take
away
from
the
beer
but
this
is
one
of
those
that
are
probably
most
appreciated
when
served
with
food
not
to
be
consumed
in
quantity
this
beer
bitch
slapped
my
brain
id
have
a
headache
if
i
had
another
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
color
that
appears
to
be
clear
and
starts
with
an
inch
of
bubbly
head
that
quickly
vanishes
down
to
nothing
the
beer
smell
is
an
uncanny
comparison
to
a
light
merlot
the
currants
are
definitely
apparent
when
you
raise
the
glass
to
your
nose
the
beer
has
good
carbonation
throughout
drinking
which
helps
to
keep
the
heavy
flavors
light
in
mouth
the
beer
is
sour
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
continues
down
the
tongue
almost
puckering
at
points
dark
fruit
flavors
abound
throughout
the
mouth
with
a
slight
peppery
spice
every
once
in
a
while
very
tasty
and
again
the
lightness
and
crispness
provided
by
the
steady
carbonation
make
this
a
nice
smooth
drink
the
beer
leaves
a
sour
grapetype
flavor
in
the
mouth
after
each
sip
but
light
the
sour
aftertaste
and
the
lingering
finish
pucker
the
mouth
a
bit
and
it
begs
for
another
sip
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
across
the
palate
and
coats
the
lips
like
a
soft
red

theres
the

and
sourness
that
gives
way
to
more
of
the
cranberrycurrant
tones
theres
a
bit
of
sugar
that
i
can
actually
feel
light
up
endorfins
but
the
ale
finishes
somewhat
dry
makes
the
saliva
glands
leak
with
the
sourness
poured
from

into
snifter

pours
a
deep
reddishorangebrown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
although
there
is
some
visible
carbonation
throughout
aroma
of
sour
lemon
tart
cherries
and
other
dark
fruits
must
be
the
currants
oak
vanilla
and
some
funk
flavor
of
tart

sour

tart

and
a

of
vinegar
the
abv

well
masked
here

with
a
sour
mouthfeel
and
mellow
carbonation
complex
wellbalanced
and
interesting
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
sours
but
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
as
well
as
the
other
rr
sours
all
in
all
this
one
definitely
did
surprise
this
definitely
is
tart
but
is
so
well
blended
that
it
makes
this
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
sours
this
will
be
like
the
holy
grail
of
well
blended
sours
if
youre
looking
for
the
most
puckering
brew
around
this
is
not
its
puckering
but
is
so
well
blended
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
lacking
much
of
the
carbonation
that
was
easily
visible
on
the
pour
i
think
it
just
leaves
the
drink
before
you
know
it
the
beer
is
better
for
it
though
as
it
drinks
like
a
wine
even
more
so
drinkability
is
great
the
beer
has
lots
of
strong
flavors
yet
i
see
the
10
abv
and
am
perplexed
finish
is
cleanly
tart
and
nice
which
sets
up
the
next
sip
pretty
well
this
is
even
better
than
i
remembered
it
consecration
would
be
nice
with
some
foodthai
indian
duck
confit
gelato
chocolateactually
that
sounds
good
drinkability
something
i
definitely
enjoy
and
a
change
of
pace
from
my
normal
hoppy
beer
sour
and
enjoyable
d
this
is
easily
the
most
drinkable
sour
i
have
tried
there
is
no
appearent
alcohol
and
such
wonderful
flavor
md
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
has
a
dry
finish
overall
extremely
drinkable
does
not
feel
like
10
at
all
look
forward
to
drinking
this
one
again
had
it
at
the
end
of
a
night
so
might
amend
this
review
later
drink
damn
i
could
drink
this
all
day
fall
off
a
bar
stool
and
keep
drinking
some
more
was
tastefully
crafted
with
well
blended
flavors
batch
005x2e
had
this
beer
quite
a
few
times
and
i
absolutely
love
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brownish
red
color
with
a
small
white
head
scent
is
not
nearly
as
sour
or
funky
as
i
has
remembered
its
actually
very
sweet
smelling
with
some
dark
fruit
aromas
smells
somewhat
like
a
desert
wine
i
get
a
small
hint
of
vinegar
now
here
we
go
the
taste
is
like
i
remembered
theres
that
puckering
sour
taste
i
was
lookin
for
first
i
get
some
sweet
dark
fruit
flavors
cherries
and
plums
then
i
get
a
bit
of
vinegar
flavor
followed
by
delicious
sour
fruit
there
is
definitely
some
funk
in
the
flavor
and
sweet
wine
notes
it
finishes
with
amazing
oak
flavors
and
tartness
high
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
its
crazy
delicious
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
complex
not
syrupy
and
not
as
dry
as
other
wild
ales
and
sour
beers
ive
had
drinkability
is
high
as
long
as
the
abv
doesnt
creep
up
d
this
beer
is
perhaps
a
bit
sour
alcoholic
and
expensive
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
that
being
said
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
given
the
opportunity
i
would
consider
pairing
this
with
an
aged
or
stinky
cheese
it
stands
up
to
other
strong
flavors
very
well
pair
accordingly
d
abv
hit
me
very
early
in
this
still
very
good
and
very
drinkable
very
good
with
all
the
sourness
but
i
wanted
more
of
the
cherry
sweetness
in
this
it
is
a
sipper
due
to
the
sourness
but
in
some
odd
way
that
is
what
makes
it
so
addictive
the
flash
of
sweet
and
the
huge
sour
kick
very
much
like
a
cherry
sweet
tart
and
a
better
version
of
one
overall
if
youre
new
to
sours
let
this
brew
warm
up
the
tart
will
take
the
back
seat
and
the
dark
fruits
and
sugars
come
to
the
forefront
an
expertly
crafted
brew
this
can
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
d
dangerously
drinkable
this
beer
is
sweet
and
tart
which
keeps
the
palate
refeshed
i
never
get
tired
of
drinking
this
beer
and
am
thankful
that
i
have
easy
access
to
it
a
fantastic
beer
caution
is
advised

big
flavor

one
that
also

a
beer

and
shows
absolutely
none
of
its
high
abv
scary
drinkable
overall
its
not
my
fav
rr
but
its
very
nice
i
just
dont
think
it
needs
such
a
high
abv
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
10
beer
though
appearance
is
dark
red
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
bourbon
cherries
vanilla
and
raspberries
as
good
as
the
smell
is
the
taste
is
quite
a
letdown
lemons
sour
grapes
slight
biscuit
bitters
and
booze
really
though
none
of
these
flavors
meld
into
anything
too
good
the
drinkability
is
fair
but
the
sourness
and
the
overall
blandness
of
the
taste
makes
one
glass
of
this
beer
just
plenty
russian
river
as
is
its
habit
has
deeply
impressed
me
once
again
it
somehow
has
mastered
the
act
of
transubstantiationit
is
able
to
take
a
worldly
object
and
transform
it
into
something
heavenly
something
sacred
indeed
something
consecrated
another
one
to
do
it
all
over
again
also
for
some
reason
i
am
getting
a
vibe
of
cool
forests
when
drinking
this
not
exactly
sure
why
but
its
a
great
relaxing
feeling

for
10
00
but
if
i
drink
a
750ml

im
pretty
well
done

a

brown
color
with
no

of

sour

not

some
nice
sour

with

than
most
sours
ive
had
i
like
the
additional
malts
here
it
works
well

not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
is
definitely
a
sourlovers
beer
work
up
to
this
one
youll
be
glad
you
did
love
this
and
all
of
the
rr
sours
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
recommend
picking
one
up
this
beer
has
an
incredible
balance
of
tart
acidic
funky
sourness
and
sweet
vinous
dark
fruit
and
it
is
the
perfect
blend
of
the

and

worlds
d10
doesnt
feel
like
10
at
all

this

taste

d
so
impossibly
easy
to
drink
for
a
10
no
booze
at
all
delicious
and
a
real
joy
to
experience
such
a
unique
beer
high
marks
because
of
the
ease
of
drinking
compared
to
the
abv
d
very
drinkable
abv
doesnt
seem
like
its
close
to
10
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
i
have
ever
had
but
still
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
go
back
for
more
loved
having
this
in
the
bottle
as
well
the
cork
was
all
twisted
to
one
side
so
you
knew
there
was
lots
of
carbonation
in
there
not
too
much
though
d
while
this
is
certainly
a
sipper
i
had
absolutely
no
problem
drinking
the
bottle
almost
by
myself
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
big
there
is
a
large
flavor
and
it
finds
its
way
down
but
has
an
aftertaste
that
lasts
and
lasts
smooth
is
the
feel
but
there
is
a
punch
coming
at
the
end
drinkability
is
high
and
is
a
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
of
i
prefer
temptation
or
supplication
but
ill
rate
this
high
anyway
being
that
it
is
still
an
amazing
sour
thanks
again

thank

a
very
dark
garnet
color
almost
ruby
when
held
to
the
slight

more
perceived
after
having
this

a

years

prefer
the
older
and

version

the
alcohol
is

good
this
is
a
session
beer
and
quite
good
for
a
sour
ale
i
could
drink
this
again
its
not
the
sour
monster
then
supplication
is
wine
drinker
would
enjoy
this
for
sure
aggressive
pour
leaves
almost
no
head
and
little
carbonation
with
a
reddish
amber
color
smells
like
a
red
wine
sour
grapes
cherries
and
smell
the
currants

like
a
sour
red
wine
picking
up
lots
of
tart
flavors
and
light
citrus
light
bodied
with
little
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
10
can
sneak
up
on
you
quickly
just
getting
into
sours
and
this
was
a
nice
one
to
enjoy
a
very
complex
beer
beer
this
is
somthing
a
bit
beyond
beer
perhaps
it
needs
it
own
catagory
glad
i
tried
it
for
the
experiance
but
not
a
beer
for
watching
the
game
tonight
this
is
unique
and
very
different
as
this
is
is
quite
a
long
review
i
have
had
quite
a
few
sips
and
i
must
say
as
both
it
and
i
warm
up
that
it
is
growing
on
me
sort
of
like
those
sour
candies
that
you
just
cant
stop
eating
super
happy
i
tried
and
not
close
to
what
i
was
expecting
drinkability
alcohol
is
well
masked
may
be
a
bit
too
sour
and
tart
for
some
due
to
the
style
but
well
balanced
with
the
fruit
and
easy
to
drink
but
hard
to
find
on
the
east
coast
and
when
you
do
it
comes
with
a
high
price
tag
the
cpj
batch
004x2
pours
a
dark
amber
color
little
to
no
head
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
keeps
it
from
being
completely
still
smell
has
a
good
amount
of
funk
with
some
fruitiness
behind
taste
is
sour
but
not
over
the
top
just
enough
lactic
sourness
for
my
liking
the
currents
are
there
but
in
good
balance
starts
off
slightly
sweet
and
finishes
dry
funky
and
sour
delicious
mouthfeel
is
lively
the
10
is
no
where
to
be
found
the
nature
of
the
style
hurts
drinkability
slightly
but
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
one
rr
is
the
king
of
american
made
sours
and
this
one
is
near
the
top
d
almost
too
easy
to
drink
10abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
this
is
just
a
great
sour
ale
that
is
worth
trying
if
you
like
sours
i
wish
this
was
easier
to
find
around
me
so
far
this
is
the
best
sour
that
i
have
had
amazingly
drinkable
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
in
regards
to
sourness
but
this
is
very
well
done
and
taste
great
ill
be
buying
this
a
lot
many
times
over
and
over
d
very
nice
indeed
this
beer
could
define
the
category
a
little
low
in
this
category
because
of
cost
availability
abv
and
taste
i
think
the
taste
is
good
but
not
so
good
that
i
have
to
try
another
i
feel
like
there
should
be
more
to
say
about
this
but
there
really
isnt
its
a
straight
forward
fantastic
sour
ale
its
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
extremely
enjoyable
dsupplication
is
still
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
i
am
consistently
impressed
by
the
sours
turned
out
by
rr
obviously
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
are
a
sour
fan
d
rr
has
taken
beers
to
a
different
level
which
i
mean
in
the
most
respectfull
way
the
aroma
is
as
almost
as
attractive
as
the
taste
as
a
fan
of
imperial
stouts
and
big
ipas
at
times
i
dont
think
i
have
the
sosphistication
for
sours
and
wild
ales
but
this
brew
is
easy
to
understand
the
subelty
of
the
complexity
of
this
brew
is
the
amazing
skill
of
the
brewer
so
the
downside
of
loving
rr
is
the
difficulty
in
obtaining
joy
of
the
hunt
had
this
ontap
at
toronado
in
san
francisco
pours
an
amberbrown
colour
with
thin
offwhite
head
great
head
retention
and
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
sour
cherry
with
some
vinegar
and
maybe
some
raisin
huge
sour
flavour
but
also
a
little
bit
of
candy
sweetness
smooth
mouthfeel
i
think
i
finished
this
off
a
little
bit
too
quickly
d
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
would
love
to
try
more
d
my
favorite
sours
and
now
one
of
my
favorite
beers
hands
down
what
a
great
vintage
and
an
even
better
way
to
share
with
friends
thanks
techster82
d
incredible
amazing
easily
rivals
anything
brewed
in
belgium
brewing
brilliance
at
its
finest
i
wish
it
were
more
widely
available
this
isnt
a
beer
youd
want
to
drink
too
fast
more
so
to
just
enjoy
it
through
out
a
night
and
good
dinner
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
though
due
to
the
high
price
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
once
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
strong
flavors
but
very
pleasant
and
unique
flavor
profile
i
want
more
taste
starts
out
with
a
sour
pucker
the
currants
add
a
nice
layer
of
fruitiness

isnt
overly
sweet

is
one
beer
where
the
barrel
aging
is
perfect
since
it
complements
the
beer
wonderfully
the
oak
has
just
the
right
balance
the
strength
is
well
hidden
behind
the
tartness
the
carbonation
is
quite
active
but
works
for
this
style
having
bought
this
bottle
in
pa
i
paid
quite
a
bit
for
it
looking
back
i
wish
i
had
bought
a
whole
case
of
the
stuff
it
certainly
isnt
the
type
of
beer
you
could
drink
a
few
of
in
a
night
but
it
is
the
type
of
beer
you
could
drink
one
of
all
night
10
abv
i
would
have
believed
it
was
6
if
someone
had
told
me
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
amidst
the
layers
of
yeast
barrel
character
and
malt
got
to
try
this
thanks
to
rencelas
poured
into
schlafly
large
tasting
glass
pours
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
smell
like
plum
and
cherries
taste
is
very
sour
but
very
enjoyable
i
could
share
a
750ml
of
this
but
not
drink
one
by
myself
overall
a
great
first
sour
for
me
from
rr
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
softer
than
a
lot
of
other
wild
ales
because
of
the
relatively
high
abv
this
is
very
good
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
russian
river
still
this
gives
a
unique
flavor
that
one
cant
find
elsewhere
i
still
look
forward
to
trying
this
one
again
hopefully
soon
a
great
rr
sour
little
expensive
tho
but
nice
for
a
celebration
night
d
it
was
fun
to
try
a
lot
of
fun
to
try
but
its
not
terribly
drinkable
for
me
i
wouldnt
have
wanted
another
one
that
night
and
i
dont
think
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
it
again
until
some
time
passes
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
id
never
try
it
again
just
not
anytime
in
the
next
several
weeks
d
not
bad
drinkability
here
obviously
its
not
an
everyday
beer
because
of
the
style
and
the
price
but
i
bought
several
to
crack
open
sporatically
top
notch
beer
from
russian
river
d
goes
down
easily
very
tasty
major
kick
somewhat
filling
very
good
representation
of
style
i
cant
believe
that
i
passed
on
this
when
at
rr
last
year
oh
how
a
year
can
make
such
a
difference
in
opening
up
your
palate
d
hard
to
put
down
lots
of
nuances
to
this
beer
that
would
lend
itself
to
aging
lucky
enough
i
have
another
bottle
russian
river
strikes
again
with
a
great
wildsour
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
and
more
heavy
then
most
ive
had
in
the
style
carbonation
is
very
high
and
sharp
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
excellent
flavors
to
it
and
some
great
complexity
as
i
said
before
i
loved
how
it
had
both
sweet
and
tart
flavors
at
the
same
time
the
currents
were
also
excellently
done
very
tart
and
sour
too
excellent
beer

batch
4x2
brownish
red
pour
with
a
ring
of
white
foam
around
my
tulip
aroma
is
actually
quite
mild
for
the
style
currants
subtle
winey
oak
and
sour
aromas
taste
is
this
beers
strength
a
well
balanced
mixture
of
sweet
fruity
flavors
of
the
currants
and
the
lemony
tartness
some
oak
flavor
as
well
but
nothing
overpowering
palate
is
smooth
with
a
nice
dry
tart
finish
i
can
also
get
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
which
i
understand
now
that
ive
seen
this
beers
abv
not
something
im
used
to
for
the
style
but
quite
interesting
cheers
very
drinkable
as
a
mellow
and
malt
balanced
sour
this
may
chnage
over
time
but
much
more
enjoyable
and
approachable
than
i
expected
for
10
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
come
across
and
i
will
continue
to
do
whatever
i
can
to
get
my
hands
on
this
even
if
i
have
to
drive
300
miles
every
month
this
is
not
a
wild
ale
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
is
strong
puckering
and
i
consider
it
only
above
average
drinkabilitywise
overall
just
not
something
i
could
see
have
many
back
to
back
of
a
good
wild
brew
and
i
guess
vinnie
has
us
spoiled
because
this
is
great
just
not
outstanding
like
his
other
american
wild
ales
this
beer
is
very
different
from
its
counterparts
damnation
and
supplication
and
i
would
rank
it
second
amongst
the
three
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beerso
good
enjoy
d
fairly
high
i
really
like
this
one
but
when
you
put
all
three
of
these
together
you
really
see
how
different
they
really
are
i
would
rank
this
one
last
out
of
the
three
but
it
is
still
so
good
that
you
can
not
go
wrong
glad
i
have
a
few
bottle
of
this
in
the
cellar
dgood
nice
representation
of
the
style
i
would
drink
this
again
so
delicious
and
packed
with
flavor
that
you
cant
put
the
glass
down
and
i
recommend
that
you
not
put
your
glass
down
if
you
wont
want
to
share
as
i
found
out
another
exciting
brew
i
get
to
sample
im
stoked
and
it
pours
a
light
reddishbrown
sherry
hue
which
starts
off
with
the
carbonation
look
of
a
beer
with
a
frothy
two
finger
head
but
it
quickly
recedes
to
look
like
a
fine
wine
with
no
head
left
or
lacing
whatsoeverthe
aroma
is
a
combination
of
dried
red
berriesfigsoak
and
of
course
currantsthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
and
to
be
honest
the
mouthfeel
is
a
cross
between
wine
and
beer
and
flavours
of
red
currantscab
savtobaccooak
and
red
grape
sourness
all
come
through
combined
rather
nicely
and
the
dry
sourness
right
at
the
finish
really
makes
it
very
drinkable
for
me
as
i
do
like
my
lambics
and
its
10abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
it
is
so
well
hidden
its
not
funny
and
overall
if
this
is
what
awas
taste
like
i
think
i
might
have
found
a
new
favourite
stylehighly
recommend
cheers
d
i
would
like
to
say
i
could
drink
these
all
day
but
the
acidity
would
probably
wear
out
my
tongue
since
i
only
have
the
privilege
to
drink
one
i
can
only
assume
very
drinkable
you
hardly
notice
the
10
abv
on
the
finish
becomes
more
funky
as
it
warms
i
like
this
beer
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
batch
3x3
with
almost
no
head
but
still
retains
carbonation
one
of
the
most
aromatic
beers
i
have
ever
had
smells
like
an
entire
bouquet
of
berries
and
wine
and
a
bit
of
wood
tastes
very
very
tart
and
has
a
hot
after
taste
lots
of
wine
flavoring
that
comes
through
in
every
sip
this
is
very
drinkable
for
being
so
strong
but
it
is
still
a
sipper
because
each
sip
needs
to
be
enjoyed
and
savored
on
a
special
occasion
a
lovely
beer
and
it
definitely
makes
me
want
to
try
supplication
im
curious
as
to
what
a
year
or
so
more
oak
aging
does
to
this
formula
i
am
officially
ready
to
move
to
the
san
diego
area
so
i
can
have
rr
sours
on
a
regular
basis
the
weight
on
my
mouth
is
great
the
beer
spreads
to
all
of
the
parts
of
my
mouth
and
coats
my
tounge
with
a
varie
of
colors
for
being
an
acetically
dominated
sour
beer
this
is
wonderfully
drinkable
i
normally
cant
handle
these
but
the
finish
here
is
so
inviting
that
i
cant
help
but
drink
more
im
finding
it
harder
and
harder
to
not
fall
in
love
with
russian
river
they
need
to
start
distributing
to
texas
whoa
way
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
a
ruddy
cherrywood
brown
color
with
moderate
tan
head
i
guess
it
makes
sense
since
this
is
a
kriekesque
brew
but
it
just
surprised
me
smell
is
tart
with
some
cherries
a
bit
of
funk
some
leather
taste
follows
suit
a
bit
tart
but
not
as
tart
as
some
other
rrs
ive
had
with
nice
cherry
flavor
that
flirts
with
medicinal
flavors
not
overpowering
thank
god
decent
malt
to
it
a
bit
of
an
oak
touch
on
the
finish
as
well
mf
was
mediumlight
dry
finish
about
normal
for
a
sour
i
was
pretty
surprised
that
this
one
was
10
pretty
easy
drink
worth
a
try
but
at
17
a
bottle
i
find
it
hard
to
justify
when
i
can
get
other
fruit
lambics
that
are
almost
just
as
good
or
just
as
good
for
half
the
price
rose
de
gambrinus
for
example
i
know
its
raspberries
and
not
cherries
is
every
bit
as
good
as
this
guy
in
my
opinion
i
feel
bad
because
my
only
experience
with
this
beer
is
with
lack
of
carbonation
so
i
cant
tell
if
its
the
beer
or
just
the
bottle
a
dam
good
well
crafted
beer
i
could
only
drink
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
but
i
sure
would
like
to
have
a
cellar
full
of
this
treat
another
beer
that
will
remain
on
my
wants
list
overall
a
good
beer
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
temptation
is
probably
my
allaround
favorite
from
russian
river
but
this
and
supplication
are
right
up
there
as
well
a
wonderful
treat
to
savor
slowly
highly
drinkable
i
would
give
this
a
5
but
it
can
get
sour
and
a
little
cloying
after
a
while
d
very
drinkable
sour
but
no
trace
of
alcohol
pretty
good
i
really
loved
this
brew
a
lot
if
this
was
available
here
id
always
have
some
for
sure
its
all
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
better
than
supplication
which
is
the
only
other
rr
sour
that
ibe
had
was
sad
to
see
this
375ml
bottle
go
could
easily
drink
another
one
if
the
abv
didnt
get
me
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
definitely
my
favorite
sour
ale
its
a
little
pricey
here
in
philadelphia
but
its
worth
every
penny
drinkability
definitely
a
bit
of
a
rare
treat
here
glad
ive
got
a
750
ml
bottle
stashed
away
still
for
another
special
occasion
amazing
beer
but
at
10
and
a
higher
acidity
i
do
feel
it
is
good
in
drinkability
but
not
great
bottle
batch
004x02
poured
into
oerbier
tulip
a
hazy
dried
blood
redish
brown
with
an
off
white
fizzy
head
that
disappears
quickly
not
an
attractive
beer
smell
is
sour
fruit
cherry
pits
sugary
sour
candy
a
hint
of
wine
oakiness
and
funk
taste
is
not
nearly
as
complex
as
the
smell
sour
grapes
at
first
followed
by
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
some
wet
oak
mouthfeel
is
puckering
at
first
light
body
with
prickly
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
pretty
drinkable
though
not
the
best
batch
of
consecration
i
have
had
im
still
trying
to
get
my
palate
for
wilds
but
this
one
is
right
up
there
all
the
other
wilds
ive
had
tart
dry
and
fruity
d
10
is
hardly
noticeable
while
the
flavour
is
amazing
i
couldnt
drink
or
afford
much
of
it
a
rare
treat
very
happy
i
bought
2
bottles
the
clear
amber
looks
absolutely
glorious
in
the
glass
sturdy
and
lovingly
giving
its
all
to
you
astute
beer
drinker
smells
and
tastes
sharp
and
slightly
fruity
currants
an
absolute
treasure
a
pleasure
it
rips
its
flavor
into
your
throat
forcing
you
to
appreciate
or
die
trying
the
alcohol
comes
out
a
bit
but
the
sour
dominates
the
profile
this
is
a
magical
beast
worthy
of
all
praise
batch
002x003
poured
into
a
delirium
snifter
with
a
color
of
dark
cherry
wood
with
brighter
shades
of
red
when
held
to
the
light
loose
tan
head
that
is
gone
in
a
flash
with
little
lacing
smells
of
yeast
must
and
horse
blanket
lots
of
wood
cherry
and
vinous
aromas
too
taste
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
oak
and
sweet
fruits
with
a
tart
lemon
flavor
like
a
good
red
wine
but
with
a
sour
twist
not
anywhere
near
overly
tart
or
overly
sweet
the
two
are
in
perfect
balance
subtle
grain
characteristic
in
the
background
clean
on
the
palate
with
no
real
lingering
tastes
medium
carbonation
with
a
light
body
that
has
a
sweet
flavor
but
a
dry
and
puckering
finish
drinks
surprisingly
easy
for
a
10
abv
beer
i
will
have
to
trade
for
more
of
this
and
try
it
fresh
too
have
had
this
many
times
on
tap
lets
talk
about
a
saraveza
pour
ruby
hue
with
a
beige
head
tart
funky
tones
with
oak
and
yeast
on
the
nose
well
carbonated
which
balanced
the
alcohol
and
tart
sour
characteristics
i
could
feel
the
alcohol
going
down
my
esophagus
which
was
pretty
warming
some
flavors
of
oak
and
wild
yeast
which
was
noticeable
but
not
as
smooth
and
tartsour
as
i
would
hope
and
the
currants
were
very
subtle
and
in
the
background
mostly
and
a
little
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
can
and
have
sipped
this
for
hours
the
effervescence
and
tartness
pace
the
consumption
and
the
quality
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
fact
that
it
really
resembled
a
wine
minus
the
carbonation
i
would
gladly
have
another
but
for
the
abv
which
at
10
is
very
high
while
i
dont
notice
the
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
or
scent
i
am
sure
i
will
feel
it
after
my
first
glass
this
is
as
drinkable
as
an
abv
of
10
or
above
could
be
overall
its
an
excellent
beer
that
provides
that
perfect
sourness
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
balanced
sours
i
have
ever
had
the
aging
in
cabernet
sauvignon
oak
barrels
coupled
with
the
addition
of
currants
and
perhaps
lactic
acid
or
brett
makes
this
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
d
for
a
10
abv
beer
the
abv
is
undetectable
and
the
beer
goes
down
easy
the
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
by
the
high
carbonation
in
my
opinion
as
i
feel
that
if
i
drank
this
too
fast
or
in
too
high
of
quantity
i
would
get
the
hiccoughs
or
an
upset
stomach
overall
an
interesting
beer
though
that
i
am
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
if
i
was
blind
folded
though
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
convince
me
this
wasnt
champagne
poured
a
new
375ml
into
my
dogfish
head
snifter
fairly
positive
its
the
first
batch
in
the
new
375s
but
i
have
already
recycled
the
bottle
without
looking
at
it
this
beer
pours
a
prune
brown
with
just
a
hint
of
a
tan
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
very
little
carbonation
leaving
no
bubbles
the
aroma
is
extremely
fruity
tart
organic
cherry
juice
with
prunes
and
dates
mixed
with
just
a
hint
of
fresh
oak
it
terms
of
tartness
most
of
it
seems
to
coming
from
a
lactic
twang
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
sour
cherry
juice
dominates
the
flavor
profile
hints
of
fig
and
date
come
thorough
behind
the
cherry
oak
comes
through
at
the
very
tail
of
the
profile
major
lactic
acid
presence
it
really
feels
one
dimensional
this
is
really
one
of
those
beers
that
no
matter
how
dirty
your
teeth
are
they
come
out
feeling
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
for
a
sour
really
enjoyable
it
really
feels
full
on
the
palate
and
finishes
extremely
dry
great
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
have
every
batch
of
consecration
while
it
is
a
good
beer
i
dont
think
its
in
the
realm
of
russian
rivers
other
sours
or
in
the
top
echelons
of
american
wilds
d
so
incredibly
dynamic
and
the
etoh
is
sooo
wellhidden
its
amazing
poured
vigorously
into
my
liefmans
goudenband
glass
head
quickly
dwindles
tan
head
forms
thick
but
fleets
me
the
carbonation
never
quits
moving
leading
me
to
believe
that
this
beer
is
still
alive
aromatics
are
so
deep
with
vinous
tones
in
this
case
it
seems
to
be
currants
added
to
the
mix
for
the
super
fruitiness
batch
004x3
weird
stuff
that
keeps
giving
off
a
wonderful
nose
hints
of
sherry
vinaigrette
blowing
off
the
rapid
bubbling
head
mild
cider
notes
with
wild
funky
tones
that
could
only
be
dreamt
about
if
your
not
drinking
this
wild
ale
horse
blanket
barnyard
doesnt
even
do
it
justice
flavor
hits
you
with
a
blast
of
oak
with
tart
fruits
galore
seems
like
currants
are
the
victim
once
again
this
beer
dares
you
to
keep
drinking
it
make
sure
your
immune
system
is
up
to
par
it
hits
with
a
very
acidic
tartness
thats
probably
not
healthy
for
your
digestive
tract
unless
your
consuming
this
regularly
if
vinnie
just
all
about
vomit
acid
inducing
sour
ales
ive
gone
too
far
but
so
far
his
damnation
was
the
best
american
brewed
belgian
anything
that
ive
tried
thus
far
i
guess
its
a
question
of
do
you
really
like
sours
i
do
its
so
different
from
your
average
brew
out
there
this
wild
fermentation
really
peaks
my
interest
even
if
it
ends
in
a
sour
vinegar
lactic
pedio
wtf
drinkability
one
of
the
readily
available
seasonal
or
when
they
release
it
at
least
russian
river
sours
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
get
it
whenever
i
see
it
on
tap
sour
beers
arent
really
my
forté
but
this
tasted
like
wine
and
sweettarts
it
was
odd
and
flavorful
it
was
also
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
taste
drinkability
a
good
sipping
ale
but
hard
to
put
down
has
a
funky
wine
vibe
going
on
d
well
it
certainly
hides
its
very
dangerous
abv
quite
well
also
this
will
be
the
third
750
ive
polished
off
on
my
own
so
i
cant
complain
about
the
drinkability
where
it
lacks
in
subtlety
it
makes
up
for
it
with
a
clean
and
sharp
mouthfeel
and
an
old
fashioned
sour
beatdown
was
fortunate
to
pickup
a
case
of
this
awhile
ago
they
will
find
a
good
home
reviewing
the
latest
small
bottle
offering
of
this
outstanding
beer
light
brown
auburn
pour
with
a
very
short
lived
white
head
no
lacing
god
awful
funk
smell
reminicent
of
rotten
berries
and
old
fruit
but
in
a
good
way
taste
is
a
lingering
sour
tart
funkiness
mouth
coating
and
pervasive
very
nice
carbonation
which
once
settled
lends
itself
to
a
smooth
sipping
pleasure
alcohol
only
becomes
appearant
toward
the
end
drinkability
in
this
portion
is
fine
but
a
large
bottle
would
approach
cantillon
level
difficulties
this
is
a
grand
beer
meant
to
be
shared
or
greedily
hoarded
entirely
your
decision
i
wish
i
lived
in
ca
d
when
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
i
would
enjoy
a
big
bottle
or
two
it
is
delicious
excellent
beer
wish
it
was
readily
available
in
illinois
believe
it
drinkability
is
quite
good
definitely
an
enjoyable
sour
i
like
the
progression
as
it
warms
with
the
emergence
of
more
prominent
funk
notes
i
like
supplication
a
little
better
but
i
wouldnt
have
any
qualms
revisiting
this
one
d
very
drinkable
but
best
enjoyed
in
small
doses
and
im
glad
matt
was
there
to
share
it
with
me
overall
a
really
great
wild
ale
and
one
that
deserves
all
its
recognition
highly
recommended
ive
had
this
once
before
and
i
think
i
enjoyed
it
just
as
much
blind
i
guess
thats
the
mark
of
a
good
beer
a
very
nice
wild
ale
i
think
i
prefer
supplication
but
this
is
also
very
good
drinkability
the
alcohol
content
shows
itself
pretty
quickly
yet
you
barely
notice
it
its
a
very
tasty
serious
drinking
beer
that
i
like
to
drink
slowly
to
savor
the
taste
ive
had
this
many
times
on
draft
and
can
find
bottles
without
a
great
deal
of
trouble
when
released
philly
has
a
good
beer
thing
going
drinkability
probably
a
oneglass
brew
but
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
as
the
experience
is
incredibly
unique
pretty
good
but
underwhelming
definitely
not
in
the
league
of
supplication
or
temptation
in
my
opinion
d
i
will
certainly
seek
this
out
again
and
be
very
excited
to
imbibe
it
i
did
split
this
four
ways
though
and
that
is
about
all
that
my
mouth
could
handle
in
a
sitting
russian
river
wow
another
great
brew
long
story
short
buy
it
and
drink
it
this
beer
in
one
word
rancorous
sampled
this
as
part
of
my
own
personal
taste
test
i
had
both
consecration
and
supplication
at
the
same
time
this
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
it
was
sampled
out
of
a
tulip
glass
the
aroma
was
intensely
sour
with
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
mixed
in
the
taste
was
just
an
outright
assault
of
sourness
which
i
enjoyed
very
much
it
was
very
aggressive
while
still
having
a
nice
balance
between
the
sourness
and
the
acidity
the
body
was
very
light
this
didnt
taste
like
a
10abv
beer
however
i
dont
see
myself
being
able
to
have
more
than
2
of
these
since
sour
beers
can
tear
apart
the
stomach
after
having
too
many
i
could
see
this
being
too
aggressive
for
some
those
people
would
probably
enjoy
supplication
more
since
that
was
the
more
mellow
of
the
two
mfd
a
sizzle
of
carbonation
w
a
lingering
heat
and
a
quickly
receding
bitterness
like
drinking
a
liquid
warheads
candy
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
10
had
two
pours
from
the
local
belgian
pub
and
two
bottles
from
the
supermarket
both
showed
a
beautiful
reddishbrown
color
with
a
small
head
the
taste
was
sour
without
being
gaudy
about
it
with
a
balancing
sweetness
that
covered
the
high
abv
almost
entirely
huge
thanks
to
a
generous
ba
that
set
me
up
with
this
right
now
im
so
excited
to
try
this
i
poured
this
into
a
tulip
just
as
russian
river
instructs
me
to
the
pours
is
lively
fizzy
and
awesome
with
a
small
head
the
does
quite
the
vanishing
act
its
here
then
gone
the
body
looks
stellar
a
beautiful
dark
cherry
red
with
lots
of
lively
carbonation
smells
sour
i
like
it
it
starts
with
a
sour
cherry
with
a
bit
of
vinegar
oak
aromas
with
nice
earthiness
this
smells
a
bit
funky
with
a
sweet
finishing
aroma
im
down
with
this
tart
right
out
of
the
gate
this
is
great
oak
and
earthy
flavors
with
tart
and
sweet
cherries
this
has
some
solid
funkiness
to
it
this
is
really
well
balanced
its
not
overly
tart
and
the
mild
sweetness
is
a
welcome
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
bit
drying
to
the
end
but
the
light
body
and
the
carbonation
makes
this
really
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
i
get
a
bit
of
heat
from
alcohol
but
this
is
so
good
i
dont
even
care
its
easy
to
drink
and
this
glass
is
lasting
me
a
while
this
is
a
really
nice
sour
and
i
will
certainly
be
seeking
out
more
dive
only
had
a
handfull
of
wild
ales
but
this
one
i
enjoyed
the
most
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
long
if
i
had
the
access
i
wish
rr
would
put
these
in
sixers
and
ship
them
over
to
the
third
coast
light
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
disappears
very
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
appearance
was
not
really
a
disappointment
considering
the
style
wonderful
aroma
of
wild
funkiness
leather
grapes
currants
and
wine
the
finest
tasting
sourwild
ale
i
have
drunk
plenty
of
lip
puckering
sourness
but
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
subtle
fruit
and
malt
notes
the
currants
are
tasted
but
they
definately
play
a
supporting
role
this
beer
seems
to
be
perfectly
blended
and
balanced
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
that
seems
well
suited
to
the
flavor
with
the
abv
way
up
there
it
limits
drinkability
but
the
375ml
bottle
seemed
like
the
perfect
serving
size
overall
this
is
a
nice
sour
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
sourest
beers
i
have
had
yet
ive
got
one
more
bottle
of
this
ill
update
if
that
one
is
more
carbonated
between
brown
and
black
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edge
where
light
catches
it
no
head
retention
just
a
white
ring
around
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
woody
earthy
with
maltiness
and
a
real
dried
fruit
presence
wine
n
grape
notes
really
come
through
this
ones
good
but
at
10
and
barrel
aged
i
think
it
needs
time
to
mellow
sour
power
up
front
and
all
the
way
through
with
a
lingering
finish
that
is
funky
n
dry
malty
n
fruity
with
flavors
of
deep
toasty
malt
and
dried
fruit
leather
and
earthy
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
but
i
always
think
that
about
sours
nice
mouthfeel
full
and
thick
d
nobody
does
ipas
and
sours
like
rr
damn
this
is
sour
to
die
for
bought
from
a
small
beer
store
in
paulsbo
wa
near
seattle
my
first
wild
ale
from
russian
river
though
i
have
been
a
fan
of
the
sour
wild
ale
style
from
belgium
for
while
its
an
attractive
red
plum
amber
color
carbonation
is
fairly
high
and
makes
it
looks
just
a
bit
like
dr
pepper
but
in
a
good
way
the
smell
is
really
nice
sour
cherries
alcohol
and
a
sweetacid
mix
the
flavor
is
similar
but
with
more
dark
fruit
a
bit
of
the
cabernet
and
oak
i
give
it
some
minuspoints
because
there
is
a
bilelike
quality
as
well
that
didnt
sit
well
with
me
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
lively
and
it
would
be
very
drinkable
for
me
if
not
for
that
bilething
going
on
in
the
background
delicious
tartness
with
some
great
slight
fruit
sweet
notes
the
high
abv
is
nice
and
warming
and
lends
the
brew
a
richer
note
pours
a
thin
head
at
first
which
quickly
dies
to
a
creamy
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
appearance
is
pretty
decent
beer
looks
very
nice
with
some
back
lighting
a
burnt
brown
glow
smell
is
not
what
i
expected
having
no
idea
what
to
expect
and
is
full
of
rich
butterscotch
caramel
and
toffee
dome
darker
fruits
come
out
as
well
cant
place
specifics
but
very
sweet
and
a
rush
of
sour
apples
damn
great
smell
taste
follows
suit
very
sweet
caramel
toffee
with
some
sweet
malt
the
sourness
is
not
as
intense
as
other
rr
offerings
it
is
still
the
main
theme
though
but
it
actually
complements
the
sweetness
very
well
and
doesnt
overpower
the
rich
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
where
this
one
falls
a
little
short
for
me
its
a
little
thin
especially
for
a
richer
tasting
beer
the
carbonation
was
just
a
hair
much
though
not
distractingly
so
the
drinkability
is
good
balanced
flavors
and
not
tongue
destroying
sourness
and
pretty
light
see
mouthfeel
this
is
exquisitely
brewed
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
can
and
did
help
set
off
a
national
trend
this
is
a
solid
drink
it
is
so
sour
that
i
want
more
to
believe
how
sour
it
is
looking
forward
to
more
russian
river
after
a
splendid
first
experience
these
are
expensive
and
worth
every
penny
absolutely
delicious
refreshing
vibrant
exciting
and
pleasant
to
drink
i
only
wish
we
could
get
rr
in
nj
but
at
least
philly
is
within
striking
distance
md
layered
and
beautifully
complex
the
age
on
it
mustve
added
to
it
id
love
to
compare
notes
on
a
fresh
one
rr
is
reason
137
to
move
california
drinkability
its
good
but
im
not
in
love
probably
due
to
my
mixed
feelings
toward
currants
i
really
had
to
give
this
beer
a
chance
but
toward
the
end
of
my
glass
i
was
feeling
okay
about
it
still
i
wont
be
actively
seeking
this
out
any
time
soon
d
mindblown
this
is
going
to
be
my
gateway
sour
ill
go
back
to
this
one
as
the
one
that
converted
me
to
the
style
andrewk
you
sir
are
an
enabler
thanks
again
a
must
try
fairly
light
with
a
dry
finish
its
hard
to
think
this
is
10
abv
on
tap
deep
dark
red
in
color
first
taste
was
a
blast
of
sour
cherry
carbonation
was
a
bit
odd
kind
of
like
a
mellow
champagne
citrus
lemon
this
beer
was
just
amazing
as
it
warmed
there
was
flavors
of
oak
rum
brandy
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
for
the
taste
buds
sensations
of
all
types
a
slightly
sour
finish
my
wife
even
liked
this
one
and
she
hates
beer
small
corked
caged
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
amber
with
offwhite
head
that
subsides
almost
immediately
vinegar
booze
and
fruit
are
evident
in
aroma
vinegary
flavor
combines
with
a
sharp
lemony
acidity
dry
fruity
finish
light
on
the
palate
and
has
an
almost
champagnelike
carbonation
very
tart
sour
complex
drinkable
for
an
ale
of
this
strength
very
enjoyable
pours
a
cloudy
ruddy
brown
very
similar
to
muddy
water
the
aroma
is
very
acidic
with
just
a
small
hint
of
berry
flavored
there
was
almost
no
head
at
all
the
taste
is
tart
and
sweet
but
not
overly
so
in
either
category
the
drinkability
is
absolutely
tremendous
for
any
alcohol
level
to
have
a
beer
at
10
that
goes
down
like
fruit
juice
is
an
awesome
feat
of
brewing
mdvery
full
bodied
and
extremely
drinkable
goes
down
really
smooth
and
you
could
easily
accidentally
drink
your
whole
glass
in
3
minutes
flat
md
mouthfeel
is
sharp
from
the
sourness
and
has
a
bit
of
the
feel
of
pop
rocks
the
flavor
is
so
good
that
its
hard
to
keep
it
in
the
glass
this
is
exceedingly
drinkable
and
overall
an
amazing
beer
this
one
of
those
rare
sours
that
displays
a
substantial
level
of
sourness
while
still
retaining
a
great
deal
of
complexity
it
doesnt
just
taste
like
cider
vinegar
their
is
a
lot
going
on
here
overall
wish
i
would
have
sat
on
this
bottle
for
another
6
months
but
if
i
had
ordered
this
at
a
bar
id
certainly
consider
ordering
a
second
doesnt
have
the
jfc
factor
of
other
versions
ive
had
but
its
still
a
beautiful
beer
light
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
ill
drink
this
10
beer
all
day
anyday
bravo
from
notes
taken
on
62210
this
was
my
first
time
having
this
on
tap
id
hate
to
score
this
low
if
it
is
a
one
off
because
it
destroys
from
the
bottle
d
super
easy
to
drink
very
surprising
for
a
sour
ale
and
a
beer
with
double
digit
alcohol
the
light
tartness
the
sweet
fruits
and
refreshing
mouth
most
everything
about
this
beer
works
i
was
worried
it
might
be
too
much
but
im
glad
i
have
this
whole
bottle
to
myself
d
fairly
drinkable
still
a
lot
to
handle
alone
i
am
new
to
the
sour
dept
but
this
one
still
leaves
me
wanting
to
try
more
so
thats
good
i
was
a
bit
worried
overall
the
americans
just
cant
keep
up
with
the
european
lambic
brewers
d
the
sourness
could
be
a
little
too
much
for
some
but
not
me
i
love
this
it
packs
a
punch
though
but
you
cant
really
taste
the
booze
at
all
first
class
sour
from
rr
absolutely
a
world
class
brew
and
one
of
the
finest
american
wilds
ever
made
though
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
with
more
patience
and
allow
it
to
warm
more
served
at
cellar
temperature
did
notice
it
improved
as
it
warmed
beyond
that
delicious
di
only
have
one
of
these
and
i
wish
i
had
many
many
more
excellent
alcohol
is
masked
perfectly
the
harsh
taste
leaves
you
wanting
more
not
bad
at
all
i
have
had
this
many
times
and
it
is
about
time
to
put
my
thoughts
down
very
enjoyable
but
russian
river
have
a
lot
better
wild
ales
imo
still
very
much
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
beer
had
so
much
hype
around
it
that
it
pains
me
to
begrudge
it
so
much
it
needs
more
attention
to
detail
head
head
retention
aroma
mouthfeel
all
need
to
be
seriously
reconsidered
before
releasing
to
the
public
i
feel
like
this
beer
was
sold
just
to
get
it
out
of
the
brewery
for
some
ive
had
this
a
couple
times
now
and
i
really
just
love
that
acidic
balsamic
vinegar
character
of
the
beer
the
flavors
are
quite
intense
and
yet
this
beer
isnt
really
a
palate
destroyer
like
ipasdipas
ultimately
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
were
available
in
wisconsin
as
is
ill
just
hafta
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
it
when
i
can
d
a
serious
sipper
the
sour
tartness
is
uber
potent
lots
of
depth
and
complexity
teetering
on
overbearing
i
really
have
mixed
feelings
on
this
after
each
sip
a
very
delicious
beer
big
thanks
to
mclk
for
this
as
an
extra
batch
003x3
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
that
subsides
to
one
quickly
lots
of
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
and
makes
a
fizzing
like
a
soda
maintains
decent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
yeast
bread
sour
apple
and
grapes
the
flavor
is
of
sour
apple
grapes
very
subtle
alcohol
and
citrus
it
has
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
the
first
wild
ale
i
had
tried
back
at
a
tasting
and
it
got
me
interested
in
the
style
this
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
flavors
all
in
one
package
that
makes
my
taste
buds
jump
for
joy
after
every
sip
if
you
have
not
tried
any
wild
ales
this
might
be
a
good
place
to
start
in
the
mouth
puckering
dry
and
effervescent
strong
lactic
tang
lemon
brett
funk
white
grape
mild
acetic
and
strong
dry
wood
character
think
cherry
balsamic
vinegar
meets
fermented
cherry
poptartfilling
gone
wild
the
finish
and
aftertaste
stings
with
acid
and
a
very
dry
lingering
cherry
and
lemon
light
body
and
very
sharp
carbonation
typical
american
wild
ale
d
really
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
style
my
girlfriend
made
a
huge
pucker
face
so
im
thinking
these
really
punishing
sours
are
a
little
easier
for
me
to
handle
than
most
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
wish
i
could
get
more
easily
will
definitely
grab
this
again
if
i
can
md
prickly
medium
bodied
i
can
feel
the
10
but
i
cant
taste
it
that
must
count
for
something
a
top
sour
just
not
as
vibrant
as
some
others
i
have
had
nice
movie
beer
that
i
will
most
likely
be
drinking
again
very
soon
d
my
first
wild
ale
and
i
am
certainly
impressed
alcohol
presence
is
hidden
extremely
well
very
complex
well
balanced
notes
first
time
i
had
this
beer
and
it
was
fantastic
had
it
along
with
the
charcouterie
platter
full
of
meat
cheese
and
fruit
and
paired
nicely
what
a
beer
theres
nothing
left
to
say
dawesome
beer
great
vinous
characteristics
with
a
light
barrel
aging
and
great
balance
of
sweetness
to
sour
the
spice
adds
some
kick
and
this
is
a
beautiful
very
wine
like
brew
one
of
my
favorites
very
carbonated
but
man
this
beer
is
smooth
could
definitely
slam
the
whole
bottle
but
might
be
in
a
little
trouble
will
buy
this
again
whenever
i
see
it
absolutely
worth
the
money
worth
searching
for
very
new
to
the
style
of
wild
ales
but
this
was
one
hell
of
a
start
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
wild
but
i
am
still
becoming
familiar
with
the
style
im
not
sure
what
is
up
with
the
finish
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
solid
d
the
sourness
could
be
a
little
offputting
to
some
but
not
me
i
love
this
it
packs
a
punch
though
but
you
cant
really
taste
the
booze
at
all
dunno
if
i
could
handle
more
than
one
without
my
tastebuds
being
shot
unreal
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
head
and
very
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
i
love
beers
that
have
a
nose
like
this
one
which
consisted
of
oak
funk
wine
vinous
characters
acidic
sour
notes
apples
and
currants
you
can
definitely
tell
its
gonna
have
some
sour
tartness
sour
vinegar
currants
strike
first
on
the
palate
with
oaky
traits
from
the
barrel
citric
lemons
and
cherry
accents
nice
sourness
the
beer
was
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
sour
and
dry
finish
it
drank
very
well
and
is
very
tasty
but
for
some
reason
everytime
i
drink
a
consecration
i
get
a
hangover
i
guess
i
have
overlooked
the
10abv
and
i
always
seem
to
drink
a
750ml
bottle
to
the
neck
oh
so
tasty
can
really
only
have
one
at
a
time
but
man
what
a
winner
the
mouthfeel
and
carb
are
spot
on
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
was
exceptionally
high
for
the
abv
and
style
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
american
wildsours
ive
had
incredible
balance
of
flavors
well
done
this
is
pretty
delicious
well
worth
trading
for
better
still
if
you
can
purchase
it
retail
far
from
my
very
favorite
sour
beer
but
that
doesnt
matter
because
consecration
is
plenty
delicious
a
big
thanks
to
enelson
for
this
one
poured
a
plum
mahogany
color
into
a
tulip
one
finger
khaki
head
that
recedes
quickly
smell
is
currants
and
raisins
up
front
with
slight
tobacco
notes
and
some
sour
apple
in
there
too
really
wonderful
complex
stuff
taste
is
wonderful
sour
but
not
too
sour
it
could
be
compared
to
sour
plum
juice
with
brett
there
really
is
too
much
complexity
here
to
identify
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
oily
very
little
alcohol
presence
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
this
was
a
really
great
beer
as
a
wild
ale
i
expected
funk
but
i
never
expected
the
amount
of
lemony
sourness
i
was
expecting
a
more
beer
type
sourness
like
more
funk
to
it
at
times
it
was
almost
like
drinking
lemon
juice
with
beer
and
it
was
great
this
was
a
great
continuation
of
sour
beers
for
me
i
cant
wait
to
crack
open
my
others
this
beer
drinks
really
well
wish
i
hadnt
finished
the
last
of
the
keg
to
all
the
boulderites
before
me
i
salute
you
to
all
those
who
didnt
partake
you
missed
out
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
but
i
did
see
a
bottle
a
few
days
ago
a
litle
dry
and
not
totally
smooth
but
very
good
pours
a
dark
amber
very
little
head
aroma
oak
cherries
sour
sweetness
taste
very
sour
currantscherriesplums
very
complex
and
oakey
finish
is
very
sour
and
leaves
my
mouth
watering
for
more
best
sour
ive
had
and
for
a
10
brew
i
could
drink
this
all
night
d
im
taking
on
the
whole
750ml
tonight
but
this
is
certainly
a
good
candidate
for
splitting
amongst
a
few
friends
md
big
carbonation
and
effervescence
keep
such
a
great
clean
taste
i
love
the
thickness
of
a
stout
but
this
is
the
complete
opposite
and
so
well
done
that
i
really
appreciate
it
just
as
much
the
10
is
essentially
nonexistent
i
couldnt
drink
this
every
day
but
the
complexity
and
style
is
something
i
would
enjoy
on
a
semi
regular
basis
4
54
5
d
moderately
high
i
think
i
like
temptation
better
but
this
one
is
right
up
there
a
supremely
tasty
beer
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
the
intense
fruit
really
makes
this
a
standout
beer
my
first
rr
wild
so
lets
do
this
it
pours
a
translucent
dark
garnet
topped
by
a
fizzy
tan
foam
thats
just
too
effervescent
to
exist
for
very
long
kinda
like
those
crazy
manmade
elements
at
the
end
of
the
periodic
table
the
laser
etch
at
the
base
of
my
glass
must
be
workin
cause
a
perpetually
resurgent
ring
o
fizz
is
dancing
around
on
the
surface
good
times
the
nose
comprises
a
good
amount
of
funk
oak
sour
grapes
sourdough
prunes
and
a
touch
of
a
bleu
cheeseranch
blend
i
can
only
assume
this
is
one
of
those
wildsour
beers
am
i
right
regardless
the
fizzy
ring
continues
to
mock
the
lack
of
perpetual
motion
machines
out
there
the
taste
is
a
new
kind
of
melange
for
me
sour
berries
sour
apples
rye
bread
a
slight
bit
of
vinegar
extra
sweet
toffee
in
background
spurts
some
of
that
blue
cheese
again
and
an
underlying
current
of
oak
im
both
pleased
and
intrigued
leading
to
a
clear
desire
for
more
of
this
the
body
appears
to
be
a
whispy
medium
with
a
surprisingly
slight
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
tasty
and
interesting
brew
simply
put
get
some
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
mostly
because
of
the
price
but
it
is
delicious
d
a
very
complex
beer
that
hides
the
10
very
well
overall
great
balance
probably
my
favorite
offering
from
rr
thus
far
this
one
even
tops
stille
nacht
reserve
96
as
my
alltime
favorite
beer
there
is
little
i
can
say
other
than
to
delineate
its
complexity
thusly
chocolate
coconut
currant
caramel
candied
orange
coriander
celeriac
radish
the
requisite
horse
blanket
and
barnyard
funk
rhubarb
lemon
zest
lots
of
tobacco
black
pepper
walnut
tangerine
acanthus
leafbay

cherry
skin
strawberry
kiwi
balsamic
vinegar
sweet
cream
butter
cigarette
ash
kale
ginger
cardamom
branston
pickle
pineapple
and
pink
grapefruit
are
somehow
all
orchestrated
meticulously
and
even
seamlessly
into
the
absolutely
handsdown
best
beer
ive
ever
had
the
delight
to
savor
the
body
is
creamier
than
ive
ever
experienced
in
a
sourale
and
the
10
alcohol
really
allowed
all
those
aforementioned
flavors
to
blossom
to
their
absolute
fullest
if
any
of
you
real
beer
aficionados
get
the
chance
to
try
this
one
dont
let
the
22
price
tag
scare
you
off
after
all
its
a
25
4
0z
dose
and
believe
me
its
cheap
for
what
it
is
drinkability
good
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
sour
funk
brown
sugar
raisins
vanilla
and
oak
taste
is
sour
cherries
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
funk
and
oak
medium
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
another
great
sour
from
russian
river
d
very
very
good
beer
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
but
the
price
is
pretty
steep
overall
a
great
wild
ale
and
another
great
beer
from
russian
river
the
beer
pours
a
rusty
brown
with
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
what
little
off
white
head
does
form
immediately
fizzles
out
given
the
style
of
beer
and
the
abv
though
this
isnt
really
a
surprise
and
ill
just
focus
on
the
gorgeous
color
of
the
beer
the
nose
was
easily
appreciable
even
as
i
first
poured
the
beer
and
its
an
awesome
mix
of
horse
blanket
funk
and
sweet
dark
fruits
with
just
a
hint
of
vinegar
skulking
around
as
well
the
straight
up
sourness
of
the
beer
is
much
more
prominent
in
the
taste
and
especially
while
the
beer
is
still
cold
it
overpowers
the
fruits
and
funk
the
balance
does
improve
some
as
the
beer
warms
while
not
overly
thick
the
beer
absolutely
coats
my
mouth
and
theres
a
subtle
carbonation
highlights
the
sour
flavors
while
the
beer
is
plenty
tart
it
shows
up
on
the
front
of
the
palate
so
by
the
end
of
each
sip
im
ready
to
go
for
the
next
one
in
addition
theres
no
heat
at
all
from
the
beer
impressive
at
10
a
great
beer
from
russian
river
in
other
words
par
for
the
course
for
them
and
one
ill
be
looking
to
acquire
more
of
in
the
future
i
havent
had
alot
of
sours
so
im
no
expert
but
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
glass
of
beer
the
science
behind
these
sour
ales
really
amazes
me
thanks
rr
great
high
carb
mouthfeel
and
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
until
the
10
gets
me
which
is
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
being
a
higher
score
there
lovely
beer
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
red
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
awesome
i
get
lots
of
brown
sugar
oak
vanilla
and
a
low
amount
of
tartness
the
flavor
is
brown
sugar
medium
tartness
dark
fruits
vanilla
and
oak
medium
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
this
beer
matured
into
a
wonderful
drink
it
was
tried
alongside
sanctification
temptation
supplication
and
beatification
and
i
think
this
beer
was
easily
the
star
of
the
show
both
refreshing
and
complicated
at
the
same
time
every
sip
is
a
new
experience
admittedly
sour
not
initially
for
everyone
but
will
grow
quickly
on
some
pair
with
goat
cheese
on
sourdough
with
fresh
red
grapes
on
the
side
complex
like
a
wine
but
refreshing
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
considerably
sour
and
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
almost
hard
to
believe
its
10
good
craftsmanship
pretty
good
sour
a
little
heavier
and
darker
than
i
usually
like
my
sours
definitely
prefer
a
fresh
supplication
to
a
fresh
consecration
d
this
beer
is
truly
a
challenge
both
in
terms
of
alcohol
content
as
well
as
flavor
it
is
most
similar
to
another
russian
river
sour
supplication
neither
drinks
as
easily
as
some
other
americanbrewed
sour
brown
ales
such
as
the
bruerys
oude
tart
or
jolly
pumpkins
la
roja
be
warned
before
you
open
a
large
bottle
of
this
beer
for
yourselfyou
would
have
to
love
sours
unconditionally
to
enjoy
all
750
ml
d
this
beer
is
fantastic
but
damn
the
sour
finish
and
resulting
sensation
is
harsh
even
for
a
guy
who
loves
sours
im
thoroughly
enjoying
it
but
it
is
a
a
bit
much
to
drink
sharing
the
bottle
is
perfect
overall
a
bit
more
of
a
boozy
kick
is
felt
with
this
one
compared
to
the
other
rr
wilds
still
super
drinkable
and
tasty
batch
4
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
color
with
a
medium
off
white
foam
head
has
an
aroma
of
vinegar
and
cherry
has
a
sour
tart
taste
with
hints
of
cherry
some
grapes
as
well
very
excellent
sour
brew
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
this
brewery
ready
to
move
to
cali
and
hang
with
vinne
just
good
stuff
d
how
this
pulls
in
at
10
abv
ill
never
know
but
damn
super
good
stuff
and
not
to
buggy
but
can
something
be
to
buggy
d
very
solid
example
of
the
style
not
the
best
but
damn
good
d
yet
another
great
wild
ale
from
russian
river
stronger
than
the
others
but
still
has
that
delicate
yet
pronounced
funk
and
sourness
great
stuff
the
abv
could
really
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
had
a
whole
bottle
of
this
to
yourself
overall
hard
to
predict
how
wild
ales
will
present
this
was
a
tasty
wild
that
is
best
consumed
with
respect
cloudy
murky
brown
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
aroma
is
sour
musty
and
woody
flavor
hits
with
sour
cherry
coupled
with
a
nice
oaky
barrel
flavor
tart
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
havent
had
many
sours
but
this
one
was
quite
a
treat
o
great
i
could
definitely
see
myself
starting
out
with
one
of
these
every
time
i
stop
in
there
cheers
definitely
a
complex
interesting
beer
wish
it
came
out
this
way
more
often
drinkability
slow
sipping
beer
and
the
sourness
is
a
bit
strong
so
one
will
not
look
for
more
than
a
glass
in
a
session
d
drinks
better
as
it
warms
not
a
sessionable
drink
but
something
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
summer
night
i
really
like
this
beer
and
would
like
to
try
other
rr
sours
so
far
the
best
american
wild
i
have
had
so
far
this
is
a
sour
delight
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
geuze
but
with
hints
of
red
wine
rather
complicated
this
is
probably
not
for
everyone
but
everyone
should
try
it
red
and
fizzy
this
was
sour
like
a
beer
brewed
with
warhead
candy
the
taste
crosses
the
line
of
tart
to
sour
its
much
like
a
white
wine
or
champagne
it
was
hard
to
pick
out
much
of
the
flavor
over
the
sourness
but
it
was
certainly
different
and
enjoyable
i
would
love
to
drink
this
again
but
not
tonight
the
flavor
is
intense
and
while
fun
does
not
promote
drinking
much
of
it
nice
light
body
easy
to
drink
with
a
dry
red
wine
like
finish
overall
for
25
for
750
ml
this
is
not
worth
the
money
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
wow
if
i
was
ever
on
the
fence
about
sours
this
beer
has
officaily
converted
me
wallet
i
am
sorry
get
ready
for
a
beating
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
rockstar
in
the
sours
category
i
could
have
this
everyday
but
id
rather
save
it
for
a
special
occasion
i
may
need
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
bottle
as
with
the
exception
of
their
ipas
i
usually
prefer
rr
in
that
modality
f
dry
finish
with
some
lingering
mouthwatering
goodness
it
has
a
hint
of
sweetness
but
mostly
dry
leaving
the
mouth
ready
for
the
next
hit
lots
of
lingering
sour
tangy
fruit
a
little
sour
cherry
a
touch
of
wild
brett
lingering
on
the
finish
little
funk
even
which
seems
to
be
a
little
more
on
the
finish
breaddy
malts
also
come
through
for
being
10
theres
no
real
booze
it
drinks
so
well
this
is
a
super
delicious
amazingly
awesome
sour
i
wish
so
much
we
could
get
it
around
here
or
even
better
if
i
could
brew
this
myself
sooo
tasty
batch
003x1
batch
number
003x1
pours
a
hazy
ruby
brown
color
with
good
tan
head
and
good
lacing
lots
of
lively
fizzy
carb
almost
reminds
me
of
a
soda
pop
hints
of
wine
and
oak
are
apparent
maybe
a
bit
of
fizzy
fruityness
as
well
light
body
thin
slick
texture
and
very
long
flavor
duration
finishes
a
wonderful
sweet
and
tart
couldnt
ask
for
a
better
brew
hard
to
tell
between
this
and
supplication
which
i
like
better
wouldnt
change
anything
about
either
of
them
i
guess
for
now
theyll
have
to
both
remain
tied
a
top
my
list
of
favorite
beers
3
5
d
not
bad
but
seems
like
there
are
too
many
flavors
competing
without
any
direction
d
i
am
in
love
with
sours
at
10
this
is
way
up
there
when
it
comes
to
sours
goes
down
incredibly
easy
supremely
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
sour
and
dangerously
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
expertly
hidden
and
the
flavors
work
very
well
together
just
enough
fruit
flavor
and
sweetness
without
overtaking
the
sour
aspects
flawless
fantastic
beer
very
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
sours
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
sours
from
russian
river
a
very
nice
effort
from
russian
river
beers
like
this
really
make
you
wonder
why
you
ever
drank
pbr
bud
or
corona
consecration
is
one
beer
raising
and
bettering
beers
reputation
ruined
by
the
macro
brews
on
tap
at
the
lagunitas
beer
circus
poured
into
a
4
ounce
sample
glass
the
shape
of
a
small
pilsner
glass
light
ruby
colored
body
with
a
small
light
beige
head
aroma
is
of
very
tart
and
funky
dark
fruits
cant
pick
out
any
specific
fruit
in
particular
taste
is
mouth
puckering
funky
tartness
to
the
extreme
very
fruity
the
barrel
aging
adds
depth
and
complexity
delicious
all
around
and
im
sure
very
satisfying
to
someone
in
the
mood
for
some
serious
funk
d
awesome
i
could
finish
the
whole
bottle
and
more
really
a
great
beer
i
think
i
might
like
this
more
then
supplication
quite
drinkable
for
a
sour
of
10
abv
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
will
seek
it
out
in
the
future
beautiful
deep
reddish
brown
in
a
tiny
snifter
bubbly
and
more
bubbly
smells
of
the
currants
with
some
sour
notes
on
tasting
bubbles
attack
every
exposed
part
of
my
mouth
giving
birth
to
a
flavor
explosion
is
it
wine
ale
sour
wood
delcicious
best
of
all
for
having
a
such
great
complex
taste
it
doesnt
kill
your
palate
this
my
favorite
of
the
russian
river
tion
beers
its
a
good
beer
to
give
a
swill
drinker
a
taste
of
exposing
them
to
whats
possible
with
a
little
creativity
and
experimentation
drinkability
wow
that
was
great
and
a
nice
switchup
from
my
usuals
at
the
toronado
but
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
more
than
two
would
definitely
be
bad
on
a
weekday
d
this
was
very
easy
to
finish
that
was
pretty
unexpected
for
something
this
big
not
the
most
sour
or
funky
beer
ive
tried
but
one
ill
try
to
get
again
so
i
can
see
how
it
develops
overall
this
fourth
batch
could
use
some
age
but
gdit
consecration
is
consecration
and
it
feels
like
consecration
raising
me
up
to
the
heavens
on
a
10
abv
gods
work
continues
to
be
done
ah
i
love
my
birthday
great
weather
and
great
beer
cant
wait
for
next
year
picked
up
a
bottle
at
a
portland
coop
because
thats
the
sort
of
town
portland
is
anyways
i
split
the
bottle
with
a
couple
friends
and
was
worried
the
sour
and
funky
flavors
but
they
actually
mild
compared
to
some
of
the
guezes
ive
tried
instead
of
being
a
big
beat
you
over
the
head
sour
beer
the
tang
compliments
the
fruit
estery
yeast
and
mellow
dark
malts
i
should
also
say
that
for
10
this
is
as
drinkable
as
any
good
beer
is
going
to
be
d
this
beer
hides
its
abv
well
but
is
not
something
that
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
in
a
sitting
because
it
is
so
tart
it
much
be
sipped
and
savored
so
i
dont
think
i
would
have
more
than
a
glass
or
two
at
a
time
its
refreshing
for
the
first
glass
but
after
that
the
abv
starts
to
hit
you
good
beer
overall
and
for
the
style
d
another
home
run
from
russian
river
in
the
sours
ive
had
from
then
while
excellent
this
is
not
as
good
as
supplication
i
like
rr
sours
more
than
cantillon
while
they
are
both
excellent
i
think
the
rr
sours
add
another
layer
of
complexity
you
dont
find
in
cantillon
california
has
no
idea
how
spoiled
they
are
this
beer
is
world
class
d
pretty
good
and
better
than
temptation
but
not
as
good
as
supplication
worth
checking
out
and
i
would
have
again
thought
it
smelled
a
little
better
than
the
taste
d
i
could
easily
have
drank
the
whole
bottle
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
batch
2
i
liked
this
more
than
the
supplication
which
we
drank
right
b4
this
overall
this
is
another
winner
from
russian
river
but
maybe
not
quite
on
par
with
supplication
i
remember
the
sample
i
had
on
tap
being
smoother
and
a
bit
fruitier
but
that
could
be
due
to
the
fact
that
this
bottle
has
been
aging
for
about
a
year
all
in
all
though
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
one
that
i
hope
to
have
again
in
the
future
looking
forward
to
trying
more
russian
river
sours
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
somewhat
lower
this
one
is
extremely
sour
overall
i
had
this
one
back
to
back
with
supplication
and
let
me
tell
you
it
dosent
hold
a
candle
it
is
a
little
too
sour
for
my
taste
and
the
oak
and
wine
barrels
while
good
didnt
do
it
for
me
in
this
brew
i
liked
it
just
didnt
love
it
skal
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
some
redness
and
brown
hues
about
it
served
with
no
head
present
and
minimal
amount
of
faint
spotty
lacing
nose
is
funky
with
oak
and
woodsy
characteristics
alcohol
and
brett
are
apparent
dry
fruit
smells
riddled
with
alcohol
taste
is
puckering
with
sourness
and
alcohol
right
upfront
playing
a
lead
role
quite
drying
and
tart
flavors
of
dark
skinned
fruit
come
through
as
it
warms
and
warms
it
does
as
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
there
in
both
warmth
and
taste
the
woodsy
flavors
mesh
favorably
with
the
alcohol
lingering
tartness
is
left
in
the
mouth
that
is
puckering
enough
to
make
you
go
back
in
for
continuous
repetitive
sips
light
feel
and
highly
carbed
this
was
one
very
enjoyable
experience
served
in
a
snifter
still
scores
highly
my
favorite
out
of
all
the
russian
river
sours
ive
tried
so
far
this
is
a
very
impressive
american
sour
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
high
ratings
awesome
d
better
with
every
sip
for
a
sour
it
goes
down
well
and
does
not
fade
opening
up
as
it
gets
warmer
this
had
a
lot
of
hype
around
it
and
lived
up
to
my
expectations
delicious
and
interesting
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
even
my
wife
appreciated
it
but
it
was
a
little
too
sour
for
my
liking
i
definitely
recommend
it
and
would
have
it
again
though
its
just
one
that
id
only
have
a
single
glass
of
at
the
end
of
the
night
overall
this
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
found
it
to
be
similar
to
others
in
the
russian
river
line
supplication
damnation
in
that
it
reminded
me
of
a
beerchampagne
and
wine
all
wrapped
up
into
one
very
complex
i
hope
to
visit
this
again
when
my
palate
has
become
more
developed
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
s
very
drinkable
even
though
it
is
at
10
abv
if
you
have
friends
that
are
wine
drinkers
you
need
to
have
them
try
this
they
will
love
it
had
this
at
monks
cafe
in
philly
poured
into
a
chalice
beautiful
dark
amber
brown
with
great
cream
colored
head
great
retention
and
lacing
medium
carbonation
smell
was
earthy
and
sweet
then
bitter
taste
started
out
momentarilly
fruity
and
sweet
then
going
to
incredibly
dry
and
bitter
from
the
currants
and
barrel
aging
very
complex
hard
to
drink
in
quantity
but
paired
well
with
a
steak
and
was
able
to
finish
it
quite
easily
and
was
left
wanting
more
by
the
end
very
good
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
on
63009
poured
a
beautiful
dark
burgundy
with
a
cream
head
mild
aroma
with
hints
of
berries
there
is
a
mild
sweet
flavor
but
ultimately
the
brett
and
sour
currants
take
over
this
has
great
flavor
with
touches
of
sweetness
then
a
very
well
balanced
bitter
finish
the
hype
is
worth
it
loved
this
cant
wait
to
have
more
this
is
a
solid
beer
high
carbonation
medium
mouthfeel
funky
and
sweet
flavor
long
lasting
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
competing
sourness
drinkability
is
excelent
i
finished
the
entire
bottle
in
about
an
hour
and
of
course
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
its
still
as
enjoyable
as
the
first
poursip
great
beer
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
mahogany
pour
with
a
ruby
highlight
and
a
short
lived
fizzy
off
white
head
deep
oaky
aroma
with
a
strong
tartness
sweet
rich
molasses
and
strong
aromatic
black
currants
rich
buttery
charred
oak
flavor
with
some
sweet
molasses
and
caramel
in
the
middle
and
finishes
with
black
pepper
vinous
black
currant
and
a
strong
lactic
sour
bite
dry
medium
body
with
loads
of
carbonation
awesome
but
definitely
an
acquired
taste
my
wife
liked
it
but
one
of
the
other
wives
hated
it
hop
heads
might
not
like
it
for
the
style
i
found
this
to
be
amazingly
drinkable
the
tartness
never
overwhelmed
and
the
dark
vinous
qualities
were
able
to
shine
through
bringing
a
welcome
balance
try
to
drink
a
aged
bottle
of
this
to
yourself
sometime
its
a
treat
and
goes
through
many
changes
over
three
hours
the
wine
is
huge
the
funk
is
light
the
fruit
is
fading
but
still
large
this
got
me
a
pretty
tipsy
im
feeling
this
10
percent
this
is
drinkable
but
it
will
do
damage
i
cant
wait
for
the
smaller
bottles
i
plan
to
drink
the
rest
of
my
batch
1
bottles
in
another
15
to
see
where
this
goes
the
third
rr
beer
i
tried
at
tjs
in
pa
yesterday
could
this
day
get
any
better
another
awesome
wild
ale
served
in
the
same
glass
as
supplication
oversized
flute
like
shape
comes
out
with
a
dark
redbrown
color
which
light
can
get
through
not
much
the
head
and
cloud
are
missing
but
i
have
never
really
seen
a
wild
ale
with
one
the
ring
around
the
edge
leaves
sticky
suds
behind
but
no
real
lacing
the
smell
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
oak
wood
and
sour
lambic
some
dark
toastycaramel
malt
shines
through
leaving
me
with
a
very
interesting
beer
ahead
of
me
the
taste
comes
down
to
sour
fruit
oak
and
brown
ale
malt
hints
to
me
in
a
very
nice
way
the
sour
and
barrel
wood
notes
compliment
each
other
very
well
and
the
brown
ale
malts
help
back
up
the
sour
nicely
not
very
complex
to
me
but
very
cool
and
creative
mouthfeel
is
nice
moderate
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
good
cream
not
as
solid
as
supplication
but
still
very
nice
a
coat
of
sour
oak
and
malt
is
left
on
the
tongue
this
one
gets
very
sour
to
me
after
a
while
one
glass
is
the
perfect
quantity
for
this
great
beer
the
price
was
awesome
and
so
wasnt
the
flavor
rr
is
great
to
me
so
far
i
poured
it
into
my
russian
river
goblet
and
was
greeted
by
the
tangy
smell
of
brett
and
the
other
wild
yeast
that
russian
river
uses
to
make
their
sours
pack
the
punch
they
do
the
color
is
deep
deep
red
almost
purple
aromas
of
sour
fruit
currents
mainly
waft
from
the
glass
the
taste
is
just
as
lively
and
tangy
as
the
smell
perhaps
even
more
so
theres
also
a
good
deal
of
wine
flavors
here
in
addition
to
the
yeast
and
fruit
elements
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
ten
percent
beer
this
was
the
beer
that
made
me
fall
in
love
with
sours
and
every
time
i
drink
it
the
moth
puckering
sensation
reminds
me
of
why
i
will
never
look
at
beer
the
same
way
again
this
is
an
absolute
must
for
sour
fans
and
highly
highly
recommended
for
adventurous
souls
looking
to
break
away
from
the
usual
drinkability
drinkability
is
extremely
excellent
given
the
10
abv
extremely
well
crafted
and
delicious
and
the
alcohol
is
not
at
all
apparent
md
dry
and
sticky
fills
out
the
mouth
then
washes
it
clean
overall
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
different
aspects
of
this
beer
seem
to
contradict
one
another
but
somehow
combines
to
make
one
intricate
beer
paired
with
cheese
the
acidity
is
more
obvious
and
scrubs
the
palate
clean
dnot
as
easy
drinking
as
temptation
due
to
the
dryness
but
still
a
great
beer
d
not
quite
as
good
as
supplication
but
still
a
great
concoction
a
great
brew
to
sip
on
and
appreciate
reviewed
from
my
notes
served
in
a
snifter
as
final
beer
at
the
lions
prides
belgian
beer
dinner
past
of
their
first
belgian
beer
fest
it
is
a
clear
beer
with
a
dark
plum
color
there
isnt
much
head
just
a
thin
offwhite
ring
of
foam
where
the
beer
touches
the
glass
the
nose
is
just
amazing
with
notes
of
port
sherry
and
a
bit
of
wild
sour
yeast
i
can
taste
sour
grapes
both
white
and
red
each
has
a
distinct
flavor
profile
there
is
a
warm
alcohol
ester
aftertaste
it
tastes
incredible
there
is
a
medium
body
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
vapors
feel
great
the
carbonation
and
sour
flavors
leave
a
little
tingle
on
my
tongue
after
i
swallow
as
a
single
glass
pour
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
if
i
ever
found
myself
in
possession
of
a
full
bottle
id
want
to
split
it
with
a
friend
d
drinkability
is
very
good
very
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
in
this
brew
750ml
no
problem
one
would
never
guess
this
one
at
10
until
it
was
probably
too
late
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
opening
this
one
up
and
i
must
say
im
pleasantly
surprised
the
initial
tartness
is
a
blast
at
first
but
quickly
drops
to
a
moderate
level
that
just
works
very
happy
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
out
taste
of
currants
mixed
with
grape
juice
a
non
educated
beer
drinker
could
think
it
passes
as
a
wine
extremely
tart
and
sour
flavors
from
wine
barrel
aging
with
4
different
strains
of
wild
yeast
this
beer
is
very
complex
and
tasty
where
some
wild
beers
taste
slightly
offensive
this
one
tastes
delicious
and
has
balanced
flavors
where
one
particular
side
doesnt
overshadow
the
other
flavors
oak
perhaps
being
the
strongest
wine
barrel
aging
lacto
and
fruit
additions
all
complement
the
flavors
in
this
delicious
treat
overall
impression
this
was
the
first
wild
ale
ive
had
since
victorys
wid
devil
a
beer
i
disliked
so
much
i
almost
dumped
it
almost
having
said
that
i
was
unsure
how
this
would
beer
would
go
over
with
me
upon
the
first
sip
my
skepticism
was
gone
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
most
complex
beerale
ive
ever
tasted
first
the
aging
in
cabernet
sauvignon
barrels
was
obvious
the
brett
was
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
complexity
of
this
amazing
ale
its
kinda
like
a
cross
between
a
wine
and
a
beer
and
not
a
cheap
version
of
either
if
this
is
not
nectar
of
the
godz
i
dont
know
what
is
at
this
level
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
it
certainly
will
take
some
time
to
down
the
750
i
approached
consecration
with
quite
a
bit
of
skepticism
i
recall
hearing
how
much
it
blurred
the
line
between
wine
and
beer
personally
i
dont
think
thats
the
case
its
very
much
a
beer
and
thats
not
a
close
question
it
has
some
vinous
qualities
but
they
complement
its
wild
ale
qualities
rather
than
compete
with
them
russian
river
really
has
a
special
creation
with
consecration
i
dont
know
how
the
other
batches
stack
up
but
this
ones
a
dandy
do
yourself
a
favor
and
seek
it
out
d
i
could
drink
this
one
everyday
if
i
had
access
to
it
its
probably
in
my
top
five
brews
of
all
time
if
beers
were
to
be
classified
like
wines
this
would
truly
be
be
at
the
top
tier
russian
river
is
the
domaine
leroy
or
drc
of
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
mild
sourness
in
the
nose
along
with
a
nice
barrel
aged
aroma
the
crystal
malts
seem
to
mellow
the
overall
sourness
the
taste
is
more
laid
back
as
well
its
easy
drinking
i
cannot
believe
this
is
a
10
abv
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
has
a
more
moderate
sourness
than
beatification
its
also
a
darker
beer
with
some
crystal
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
its
tasty
and
not
overly
wild
d
the
flavor
is
sublime
but
consecration
lays
a
bit
heavier
on
the
stomach
than
russian
rivers
other
sours
due
to
the
10
abv
the
highly
acidic
sourness
and
the
richer
dark
fruit
element
still
i
was
easily
able
to
navigate
my
way
through
two
large
pours
of
this
complex
beer
minimal
head
quick
dissipation
no
lacing
to
speak
of
dark
amber
body
faint
dried
fruit
in
the
nose
little
hop
presence
taste
is
of

no

a
bit

brett
pucker

dry
attentuated
finish
at
this
abv
not
sessionable
one
is
enough
but
quite
drinkable
not
quite
in
the
league
of
cascade
brewingraccoon
lodge
but
this
was
a
very
tasty
sour
certainly
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
although
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
not
quite
as
fullflavored
or
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
it
to
be
regardless
this
is
another
noteworthy
release
from
vinny
and
company
at
russian
river
d
im
typically
not
too
big
a
fan
of
russian
rivers
sour
ales
but
this
one
was
my
favorite
this
is
a
great
beer
for
catching
wine
enthusiasts
or
nonbeer
believers
off
guard
in
what
they
think
a
beer
can
be
glass
is
filled
carefully
and
slowly
to
the
lip
leaving
no
room
for
a
head
and
initially
served
a
little
too
cold
color
is
a
murky
reddish
brown
fairly
clear
and
viscous
looking
strong
vinous
aroma
balanced
and
alternating
oaky
mild
vanilla
sweetness
with
acidic
funky
dark
fruit
sourness
flavor
is
deep
dark
and
complex
at
colder
temps
the
sour
and
funky
dominates
ripe
apple
ciderlike
tart
cherries
berries
brettfunk
etc
warming
up
this
becomes
much
more
complex
as
the
sweeter
wood
flavors
reveal
themselves
and
turn
this
into
even
more
of
a
sipper
sharp
mouthfeel
fuller
bodied
and
moderate
carbonation
and
lingering
finish
relatively
dry
i
still
prefer
supplication
to
this
but
thats
not
really
a
bad
thing
not
easiest
to
approach
of
the
rr
wilds
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
if
you
are
this
is
exceptional
i
have
yet
to
fully
enjoy
a
sour
experience
so
maybe
its
just
not
my
thing
an
excellent
extremely
thirstquenching
interesting
pleasant
beer
i
could
go
on
an
excellent
choice
to
be
my
500
review
this
is
an
absolutely
exceptional
beer
theres
no
getting
around
it
this
beer
proves
why
american
wild
ale
is
a
unique
style
and
why
it
is
such
a
wellregarded
one
at
that
it
also
cements
in
my
mind
russian
river
as
an
exceptional
brewery
the
complexity
is
incredible
i
cant
believe
how
much
there
is
going
on
lets
just
put
it
bluntly
this
is
a
really
really
really
good
beer
drinkability
this
beer
was
my
first
funky
american
wild
ale
that
was
conditioned
in
cabernet
oak
casks
the
sourness
was
honestly
overpowering
at
first
both
through
the
smell
and
taste
more
so
with
the
taste
however
as
the
beer
opened
up
the
aromas
firstly
became
very
exciting
and
did
the
beers
conditioning
absolute
justice
the
taste
took
longer
to
come
around
but
as
i
began
to
realize
the
complexity
i
wanted
nothing
but
more
overall
a
very
good
sour
beer
a
sipper
and
one
to
enjoy
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
more
savor
this
one
enjoy
it
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
in
the
future
thanks
sean
poured
a

with

and
a
nice
white
head
nose
is
tart
berries
oak
and
just
a
plain
overall
sour
aroma
taste
followed
the
nose
ery
much
the
same
with
tart
berries
being
the
first
thing
you
taste
and
then
oak
booze
and
earthiness
this
is
my
favorite
rr
sour
very
tasty
big
and
awesome
alcohol
is
noticable
but
the
flavor
just
tends
to
bury
it
very
damn
good
d
highly
enjoyable
for
me
this
is
strictly
better
than
temptation
though
both
are
solid
beers
deeper
and
more
complex
and
i
enjoy
the
dark
fruit
overtones
in
this
one
worthy
of
the
praise
seek
it
out
notes
like
a
great
cabernet
but
sweeter
fruitier
and
more
delicious
wonderful
dark
brown
color
with
red
hues
nice
tan
head
fades
quickly
this
beer
has
fairly
restrained
carbonation
sourness
is
evident
in
the
aroma
from
the
first
whiff
apple
cider
vinegar
mixed
with
brown
sugar
and
fermented
berries
wow
this
tastes
amazing
tons
of
sour
tart
cherries
berries
citric
acid
and
vinegar
this
is
backed
up
by
a
dark
sugar
caramely
malt
base
with
what
seems
like
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
spice
also
has
a
bit
of
a
red
wine
like
quality
quite
tasty
and
begging
for
another
sip
fairly
full
bodied
with
a
somewhat
sticky
finish
the
sour
helps
balance
off
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
also
worth
mentioning
that
for
being
it
goes
down
quite
smooth
cannot
detect
the
10
abv
at
all
for
the
style
i
would
say
this
is
quite
drinkable
i
think
i
will
have
another
drinkability
delicous
beer
highly
regarded
and
worth
it
could
easily
finish
a
750ml
bottle
if
i
wasnt
driving
anywhere
amazing
barrelaged
sour
beer
from
russian
river
thanks
cole
for
having
this
brought
in
from
the
west
coast
for
some
midwest
beeries
lots
of
sour
and
delicious
puckery
taste
to
this
beer
the
currants
add
a
rasiny
almost
fruity
aftertaste
to
the
palate
the
cab
barrel
must
have
had
a
hand
in
adding
some
sort
of
tannic
quality
to
the
beer
but
it
is
not
overpowering
the
sour
really
shines
through
excellent
time
in
the
barrel
and
very
delicious
a
true
sipping
beer
and
a
worthy
treat
consumed
on
1272010
finishes
dry
with
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
10
light
fizzy
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
very
smooth
for
a
sour
or
wild
ale
very
drinkable
this
is
my
secondfavorite
russian
river
sour
behind
supplication
highly
highly
recommended
pourned
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
soda
fizz
head
that
dissipated
as
quickly
as
it
formed
smell
was
really
great
deep
musty
wood
a
hint
of
barnyard
and
sour
fruit
taste
rivaled
the
tartness
of
la
folie
bracingly
sour
i
couldnt
believe
it
a
healthy
dose
of
barnyard
funk
intermingled
with
red
wine
tannins
and
oak
wood
almost
spicy
outstanding
mouthfeel
was
light
not
too
fizzy
but
kept
a
nice
sour
tartness
on
the
tongue
not
thin
by
any
means
drinkablility
was
pretty
good
although
it
was
a
little
rough
getting
the
last
bit
down
i
could
feel
the
glands
in
my
jaw
start
to
swell
a
little
bit
and
my
mouth
was
getting
pretty
dry
from
all
the
tartness
but
didnt
change
the
amazingness
of
this
beer
10
no
way
out
of
a
bottle
provided
by
a
ba
member
this
beer
was
a
murky
copper
color
the
head
was
similar
to
the
color
of
toasted
wood
the
retention
was
ok
as
a
thin
collar
and
the
lacing
in
spots
the
aroma
was
big
and
sweet
with
dark
fruits
grapes
and
raisins
currants
sweet
dough
alcohol
and
candied
fruit
like
an
alcohol
infused
fruitcake
the
flavors
were
very
similar
to
the
aroma
but
aggressively
tart
highly
acidic
which
was
further
pronounced
by
the
alcohol
punch
and
i
tasted
the
additions
of
kirsch
as
well
as
some
funky
musty
wood
the
currants
truly
came
through
on
the
finish
giving
the
brew
a
unique
character
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
lightmedium
for
10
it
was
very
drinkable
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
variety
and
complexity
available
within
the
american
wild
ale
style
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
sour
one
of
my
favorites
by
a
lot
all
three
were
great
and
i
would
have
them
again
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
crisp
the
carbonation
was
wonderful
adding
another
amazing
aspect
to
this
beer
its
amazing
that
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
venture
into
sour
beers
or
anything
from
rr
for
this
long
definately
an
amazing
treat
drinkability
a
stunningly
bold
achievement
may
be
the
best
thing
russian
river
produces
the
drink
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
vivacious
carbonation
the
fluffy
refreshing
tangy
nature
of
the
brew
belies
the
otherwise
invisible
10
abv
and
lends
itself
to
being
quaffed
more
quickly
than
is
likely
advisable
good
stuff
murch
and
thanks
again
d
wow
this
is
another
excellent
sour
from
the
folks
at
russian
river
delicious
rich
and
complex
this
beer
has
aged
very
well
so
far
and
is
certainly
a
slow
sipper
this
should
definitely
be
shared
750ml
is
too
rich
for
one
person
in
one
sitting
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
d
this
was
balanced
complex
and
extremely
refreshing
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
a
world
class
beer
for
sure
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
fizzysoapy
shortlived
beige
cap
it
looked
a
lot
like
a
glass
of
coke
with
not
much
head
or
lace
to
speak
of
it
was
a
light
gusher
too
so
watch
out
aromas
of
tobacco
leaf
cherries
berries
currants
earthy
with
a
light
funk
red
wine
strawberry
seeds
hint
of

more
earthiness
as
it

the
flavour
was
a
combination
of

and
earthy
chocolate

a
bit
tart
but
very
pleasant
and
nonaggressive
in
this

faint

warmth
in
the

moderate
carbonation
after
the
initial
loss
of
aggressive
carbonation
it
took
about
20
minutes
to
clear
from
the
bottle
a
bit
of
woody
astringency
i
really
liked
this
one
nicely
balanced
with
complex
fruit
flavours
its
a
world
class
brew
from
a
world
class
brewer
drinkability
there
was
a
time
not
too
long
ago
when
id
have
rated
the
taste
and
aroma
of
this
one
well
below
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
sours
have
grown
on
me
since
then
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
sweet
and
sour
combo
almost
reminds
me
of
an
oud
bruin
in
places
but
theres
enough
sourness
here
that
it
falls
firmly
in
the
right
place
and
its
also
probably
not
purely
funk
enough
its
hard
for
me
to
give
anything
thats
10
abv
a
drinkability
thats
too
high
ergo
the
score
on
this
one
but
its
still
pretty
amazing
this
one
seems
like
one
you
couldnt
age
too
terribly
long
without
it
getting
violently
carbonated
but
i
would
have
liked
the
pure
brett
on
this
one
to
be
a
little
more
pungent
something
that
would
only
come
with
additional
age
id
love
to
try
batch
001
right
around
now
or
to
get
a
current
bottle
and
let
it
sit
for
2
3
years
a
phenomenal
brew
brimming
with
complexity
aromas
and
flavors
this
one
would
have
paired
well
with
some
roquefort
or
stilton
had
i
had
any
curses
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
foamy
head
that
doesnt
linger
long
and
settles
to
a
ring
for
the
rest
of
the
drink
smell
is
of
light
sour
note
of
currant
taste
is
clean
sour
currant
again
with
nice
full
oak
flavor
that
balances
well
to
the
finish
leaving
a
great
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
with
pleasant
carbonation
a
great
sour
drinkablility
is
lower
simply
because
of
the
10
abv
but
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
snifters
of
this

d
for
a
10
sour
its
pretty
damn
drinkable
i
think
the
the
thin
mouthfeel
contributes
to
this
d
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
but
im
feeling
it
after
only
half
of
the
beer
pours
a
red
wine
like
brownish
purple
hue
with
a
small
head
funky
mildly
vinous
nose
with
some
wood
character
and
currant
fruit
winelike
tannic
and
sour
with
no
alcohol
note
apparent
dry
and
very
ripe
with
a
fresh
fruit
note
the
skin
of
the
currant
and
the
cabernet
barrels
harmonize
wonderfully
a
truly
nice
beer
i
was
lucky
enough
to
enjoy
a
little
less
than
half
of
this
bottle
and
enjoyed
every
sip
thoroughly
this
bottle
is
worth
the
25
charged
share
it
for
a
full
25oz
may
be
a
bit
much

the

a
killer
beer
in
general
sure
wish
this
one
lived
closer
d
if
i
can
drink
an
entire
750
by
myself
you
can
too
drinkability
is
high
the
flavor
profile
on
this
beer
is
fantastic
which
just
brings
you
back
for
more
the
abv
is
easily
managed
and
well
incorporated
all
in
all
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
recieved
in
a
trade
with
ncbeerfan
batch
number
002x2
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
with
a
nice
head
that
quicly
fades
to
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
it
leaves
no
lacing
smells
mostly
of
barnyard
and
hay
sweet
sour
fruit
dances
in
the
background
also
nice
oak
flavors
in
there
as
well
sour
fruits
dominate
the
palate
nice
oak
flavors
in
there
as
well
along
with
the
hints
with
of
cabernet
the
mouth
puckering
sourness
leaves
me
wanting
another
sip
after
sip
loads
of
carbonation
but
thats
expected
with
the
style
not
a
hint
of
the
10
alcohol
this
is
my
first
true
sour
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
o
this
beer
is
not
for
the
weak
of
heart
or
mind
among
the
sours
consecration
batch
3
is
demonstrating
the
finer
points
of
this
brewing
art
the
sourness
hits
you
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
jaw
muscles
like
a
sour
apple
with
each
refreshing
sip
d
drinks
amazing
for
10
and
keeps
getting
better
with
age
if
this
were
lower
in
alcohol
it
might
be
a
little
more
versatile
but
otherwise
this
is
excellent
and
worth
the
20
price
tag
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
drinks
more
like
a
wine
than
a
beer
aged
in
wine
barrels
and
carrying
the
flavors
over
into
the
finished
product
with
a
unique
character
added
to
the
tartness
of
this
beer
all
the
rr
products
are
made
to
the
highest
of
standards
by
one
of
craft
beers
true
master
brewers
i
recommend
trying
all
their
brews
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
them
i
am
overwhelmed
with
appreciation
for
this
tasty
beverage
pours
dark
amberruby
my
lighting
is
not
very
good
with
almost
nonexistent
white
head
feels
very
smooth
in
my
mouth
and
mouthpuckeringly
sour
with
grape
floral
and
oak
tones
it
almost
tastes
like
a
fine
red
winemaybe
a
syrahand
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
pours
a
brillant
amber
hue
that
is
flat
in
color
and
appearence
no
head
at
all
with
zero
lace
good
for
the
style
the
aromas
are
bold
and
big
on
wine
tons
of
sour
red
fruit
with
hints
of
sweet
tarts
funk
and
cherry
juice
inviting
the
sweet
tarts
come
thru
as
does
a
bit
of
crushed
aspirin
beneath
that
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
red
fruit
that
is
heavy
on
the
cherries
winey
sourness
pushes
thru
along
with
bits
of
wood
and
vineous
qualities
medium
in
body
a
bit
sharp
on
the
tongue
with
a
dry
finish
what
have
i
learned
here
tonight
like
all
the
other
russian
river
sours
this
one
just
gets
better
with
age
i
have
never
been
a
big
of
a
fan
of
consecration
as
most
beer
geeks
have
seemed
to
be
but
after
tasting
this
batch
1
some
time
later
i
think
i
may
be
converted
really
tasty
recommended
for
cellaring
drinkability
this
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
the
extreme
tartsourfunk
flavors
make
this
a
beer
that
is
best
enjoyed
over
a
longer
period
of
time
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
quaffable
no
doubt
but
there
is
no
reason
to
do
so
additionally
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
get
just
a
slight
warming
after
each
sip
a
very
enjoyable
sourwild
ale
this
was
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
sour
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
the
oak
aging
really
makes
this
beer
what
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
at
a
good
price
overall
this
is
so
different
but
so
good
if
you
love
wildssours
this
beer
is
for
you
complexity
really
makes
this
beer
a
one
of
a
kind
very
nice
glad
i
got
to
try
such
a
rare
beer
on
tap
drinkability
russian
river
always
does
a
great
job
on
sour
beers
as
well
as
dipas
and
consecration
is
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
it
started
off
with
a
bang
with
the
bottle
explosion
slowed
down
in
the
appearance
and
then
kicked
into
high
gear
with
its
top
notch
sour
and
tart
aroma
and
taste
of
course
like
every
other
russian
river
beer
its
expensive
as
hell
its
worth
a
shot
once
if
you
can
pry
open
your
wallet
far
enough
ye
gads
bravo
drinkability
this
beer
perplexes
me
a
bit
each
time
i
take
a
sip
the
sourness
blows
me
back
soon
however
i
am
appreciating
the
undertones
and
finally
i
find
myself
yearning
for
another
sip
this
is
a
truly
interesting
beer
well
done
and
keep
up
the
great
work
vinnie
drinkability
lovely
beer
one
of
the
most
drinkable
soured
beers
i
have
ever
tried
will
gladly
recommend
to
experienced
beer
lovers
and
inquiring
minds
concerning
innovative
soured
beers
go

might
like
less

very
complex
very
wine
like
more
tart
than
i
remember
last
time
was
on
tap
and
more
funk
overall
very
good
more
oak
and
less
sour
than
on

into

18th
inch
head
settles
out
instantly
to

the

a

some

maybe
just
a

the

lightly

lightly
puckering
flavor
comes
on
strong
with
cherries
currants
very
tart
a
nice
long
rolling
tartness
just
a
faint
bit
acetic
which
i
like
in
small
quantities
lots
of
oak
woody
and
dry
not
vanilla
perhaps
they
used
nonamerican
barrels
as
its
warmed
slightly
im
picking
up
the
brett
in
the
nose
a
kinda
spicy
chemicalleather
its
coming
forward
in
the
taste
too
again
leathery
and
earthy
melding
into
the
sour
fruits
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
on
this
beast
its
an
intense
beverage
to
be
sure
but
well
balanced
the
tartness
is
just
right
no
real
sign
of
the
booze
goes
down
easily
all
things
considered
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
stuff
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
fairly
complex
i
approached
this
beer
with
eager
anticipation
and
confidence
that
it
wouldnt
disappoint
as
expected
it
did
not
consecration
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
almost
blood
orange
hues
and
a
healthy
pink
lacing
a
depthful
aroma
forwarns
of
tartness
but
better
yet
contains
a
rich
dark
fruitiness
and
even
what
is
it
tamarind
hints
of
vinegar
and
dried
fruit
follow
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
obviously
tart
subtly
sour
and
surprisingly
chewy
and
full
ever
present
is
oak
rounding
out
dried
fruits
lactic
notes
at
times
lighter
notes
of
raspberry
almost
shine
through
a
beery
like
vinegar
flavor
stings
at
the
palate
long
after
the
sip
is
consumed
if
one
focuses
in
on
the
oak
it
opens
up
just
slightly
enough
to
reveal
vanilla
and
coconut
vinous
though
a
lesser
masterpiece
than
temptation
sanctification
supplication
or
beatification
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
tour
de
force
nonetheless
caged
and
corked
belgian
style
bottle
pours
a
regal
tone
of
soft
brown
under
a
lighter
mocha
head
the
nose
on
this
one
is
infused
with
wood
and
hints
of
maple
on
the
tongue
instantly
noticable
are
notes
of
soft
vermouth
ripe
fruit
light
pepper
complexity
extending
light
funk
and
echos
of
yeast
coursing
through
simply
delicious
in
every
way
smooth
soft
flavorful
and
yummy
in

dark

wet

california
sort

way
please
consider
distributing
this
to
my
local
bars
and
stores
sometime
soon
d
i
was
one
and
done
with
this
beer
not
because
it
is
bad
because
it
wasnt
the
higher
abv
made
this
beer
a
one
and
done
for
me
overall
i
feel
this
brew
lacks
a
complexity
that
i
like
in
a
wild
i
enjoy
this
brew
immensely
but
this
750
is
going
to
be
a
chore
to
polish
off
overall
i
fear
that
my
review
will
not
do
it
justice
as
i
really
am
at
a
loss
for
words
so
much
complexity
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
thanks
james
for
the
truly
warming
house
warming
d
delicious
complex
wild
ale
far
exceeded
my
expectations
yet
between
the
abv
and
dry
finish
finishing
this
big
bottle
was
a
bit
laborious
taste
is
almost
perfectly
balanced
initial
sourness
melds
into
some
wonderful
fruit
nuances
just
the
right
amount
of
sourness
for
my
tastes
tartness
livens
up
the
mouthfeel
while
the
beer
remains
very
refreshing
and
noncloying
extremely
drinkable
at
10
well
done
sirs
well
done
overall
a
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
most
compley
ive
tasted
very
full
bodied
with
sour
flavors
playing
2nd
fiddle
to
the
fruit
and
oak
id
love
to
see
some
age
on
this
beer
where
hopefully
some
of
the
fruit
will
calm
down
a
hair
allowing
the
brettsour
to
show
through
drinkability
i
was
really
afraid
that
i
wouldnt
like
this
beer
but
that
wasnt
the
case
at
all
this
was
fantastic
i
couldnt
get
enough
ill
definitely
be
buying
consecration
again
also
i
liked
it
much
better
than
temptation

d
too
tart
and
too
much
phenol
like
taste
to
drink
a
lot
of
in
all
fairness
this
might
be
a
better
beer
than
im
going
to
end
up
rating
but
it
was
following
two
sweeter
beers
that
were
both
amazing
ng
raspberry
tart
and
rr
temptation
d
a
remarkably
good
drinker
overall
pretty
damn
good
sour
but
not
world
class
as
its
rating
and
ranking
suggest
worth
trying
but
dont
overpay
or
trade
for
it
got
a
bottle
of
batch
1
involuntary
response
from
hi
times
in
costa
mesa
ca
smelled
like
currant
jam
and
a
little
bit
of
balsamic
vinegar
had
been
smeared
right
on
my
upper
lip
and
i
eagerly
awaited
licking
it
off
poured
like
juice
slightly
viscous
thin
syrup
like
from
canned
fruit
little
to
no
head
tastes
like
involuntary
response
currants
picked
at
the
peak
of
perfection
crushed
by
the
feet
of
nubile
virgins
and
i
was
licking
their
feet
gratefully
smacking
my
lips
licking
my
lips
leaving
it
in
my
mouth
just
to
tease
to
see
how
long
i
could
go
without
swallowing
it
when
it
was
finished
i
was
a
little
tipsy
and
begging
for
more
it
was
a
great
beer
and
i
will
drink
again
starting
to
overcarbonate
champagne
style
large
bubbles
muddle
up
the
complexity
of
this
one
touches
of
unwanted
acidity
are
also
coming
forward
and
the
fruit
has
definitely
died
off
a
bit
as
well
as
the
sharp
tannic
bite
from
the
wine
barrels
not
saying
it
isnt
deep
just
not
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
drinks
easy
as
a
wild
ale
the
abv
a
touch
too
dry
for
me
to
be
completely
happy
with
it
another
great
sour
from
these
guys
what
a
great
beer
side
by
side
vs
t20
i
prefer
this
one
much
more
depth
of
flavor
and
juicier
not
quite
as
funky
and
dry
as
the
t20
though
i
can
only
see
this
getting
better
with
age
also
yikes
such
a
joy
preserved
lemons
red
wine
leather
fruity
red
wine
and
just
plain
fuxking
delicious
moderately
tannic
a
fucking
masterpiece
on
the
nose
the
palate
is
similarly
deep
complex
and
very
well
balanced
the
lemony
sourness
is
a
characteristic
that
is
diminishing
in
the
newer
russian
river
sours
a
change
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
but
this
vintage
is
a
clean
crisp
sour
one
with
a
nice
blend
of
lactic
and
citric
wonderful
wine
and
fruity
notes
very
much
so
awesome
awesome
stuff

this
was
my
first
rr
sour
beer
and
it
has
inspired
me
to
seek
out
their
others
d
overall
the
beer
looked
great
smelled
great
and
went
down
easy
the
10
alcohol
was
enjoyable
as
well
this
would
be
a
interesting
beer
to
share
with
others
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
as
the
bubbles
explode
fiercely
all
over
the
palate
its
sticky
and
stays
with
you
for
a
while
drinkability
is
no
doubt
limited
to
this
750ml
bottle
i
would
prefer
less
actually
but
since
its
here
ill
drink
it
d
wow
this
is
one
tremendously
complex
brew
this
could
easily
bridge
the
gap
between
beer
and
red
wine
a
breed
all
of
its
own
had
this
again
batch
4
fresh
on
4202010
and
its
very
very
well
done
a
currant
bomb
overall
id
say
this
is
an
extremely
light
very
drinkable
beer
almost
indescribably
so
considering
its
heavy
hitting
abv
you
wouldnt
know
it
was
10
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
sourness
is
not
so
insane
that
it
ruins
your
palate
i
can
drink
this
all
night
long
what
a
treat
i
still
have
not
met
a
russian
river
beer
that
hasnt
amazed
me
highly
recommended
d
really
drinkable
for
the
style
and
abv
you
would
never
guess
its
a
10percenter
overall
not
impressed
with
this
beer
for
the
price
we
paid
vinny
could
stand
to
take
some
lessons
from
peter
or
make
a
return
trip
to
belgium
and
learn
from
the
masters
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
with
almost
no
lacing
very
carbonated
which
makes
it
look
really
nice
very
funky
and
sour
theres
some
cider
and
vinegar
to
it
very
sharp
on
the
tongue
it
gets
a
bit
better
as
it
warms
up
really
cool
and
worth
trying
the
carbonation
is
lively
on
the
tongue
and
the
finish
is
dry
with
dark
fruit
character
great
head
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
burgundy
of
beer
notes
such
a
crazy
brew
some
beers
can
e
likened
to
muscat
grapes
this
one
is
more
like
french
red
wine
drinkability
is
moderate
slightly
drying
the
bitterness
limits
drinkability
somewhat
a
healthy
10
oz
served
in
a
wine
glass
closer
to
12
or
14
oz
brownish
red
in
color
with
very
little
head
it
is
oily
with
the
existant
lace
sticking
and
sliding
down
the
glass
clear
mostly
opaque
and
with
medium
carbonation
berries
and
bananas
in
the
aroma
it
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
none
of
the
banana
characteristics
are
present
in
the
taste
however
sour
but
not
over
the
top
with
very
noticeable
ketonealdehyde
characteristics
hints
of
bourbon
in
the
flavor
and
a
bite
to
the
tounge
light
mouthfeel
surprisingly
bitter
finish
as
a
lambic
a
nice
balance
between
the
sourness
and
malt
worthy
of
a
second
tasting
personally
up
front
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
oak
barrel
infused
types
of
beer
that
tastes
like
wine
or
whiskeys
consecration
is
in
this
category
although
i
can
see
drinking
this
over
temptation
blonde
thats
not
saying
much
not
worth
the
price
i
rather
just
buy
a
flemish
sour
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
about
a
year
later
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
just
as
good
id
drink
more
if
they
werent
20
each
this
is
a
beer
i
cannot
think
of
a
food
to
pair
with
it
stands
alone
to
be
tasted
enjoyed
on
its
own
merits
very
full
bodied
yet
not
over
the
top
thickness
works
well
with
the
high
level
of
bubbles
in
this
guy
another
awesome
rr
overall
a
fine
beer
and
a
really
interesting
at
least
imo
melding
of
styles
i
like
the
flemish
lick
that
the
addition
of
currants
and
barrel
aging
provide
and
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
get
too
flemish
on
us
and
forgoes
having
too
much
vinegar
barf
flavor
an
impressive
and
incredibly
complex
and
educational
beverage
one
i
will
be
sure
to
cellar
and
enjoy
again
in
the
future
excited
to
see
how
this
batch
2
is
great
beer
sourness
puckers
the
tongue
initially
but
otherwise
it
is
smooth
and
silky
leaving
a
syrupy
funky
taste
on
the
palate
probably
the
best
batch
of
consecration
that
i
have
had
not
quite
the
duchesse
but
a
damn
good
sour
bottle
shared
by
miketd
thanks
mike
pours
dark
brown
with
off
white
head
has
acid
and
tart
cherry
aromas
flavor
is
tart
cherry
dark
fruit
wood
and
some
wine
notes
finishes
with
a
super
pucker
mouth
watering
sourness
that
is
great
medium
light
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
brew
and
one
i
really
liked
on
tap
at
belmont
station
and
baileys
taproom
in
portland
pours
a
hazy
rubyplum
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
red
wine
cherries
and
oak
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
strong
sourness
that
reminds
me
at
times
of
some
of
my
favorite
sour
candies
but
it
isnt
that
simple
since
the
barrel
creates
a
nice
complexity
and
keeps
me
going
back
for
more
im
not
a
sour
beer
expert
but
i
really
liked
this
drinkability
is
excellent
prefectly
proportioned
on
the
palate
with
a
wonderful
fruit
bouquet
and
mildly
vinous
finish
that
works
magic
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
phenomenal
it
dances
on
the
palate
with
a
sour
character
that
enhances
the
drinkability
cheers
light
body
and
carbonation
good
amount
of
acidity
some
alcohol
warmth
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
expect
for
a
beer
of
this
size
very
complex
and
delicious
dark
amber
colour
with
large
bubbles
at
first
that
could
have
easily
fooled
me
for
being
a
belgian
import
nose
has
a
pleasant
sour
cherry
component
with
light
vinegar
and
fig
newton
snacks
just
as
im
starting
to
enjoy
it
the
brett
funk
kicks
in
and
the
fair
reviewer
side
of
me
reminds
me
that
barnyard
is
supposed
to
be
good
here
the
sourness
dominates
on
the
palate
with
cherry
taking
some
background
to
the
fig
newtons
and
vinegar
finish
is
long
and
vinegary
and
really
smacks
you
in
the
face
with
the
flavors
even
if
you
like
the
style
it
is
still
hardly
something
that
anyone
should
describe
as
having
high
drinkability
d
wow
if
i
was
never
allowed
to
drink
red
wine
again
and
wanted
to
still
experience
many
of
the
positives
i
would
reach
for
this
the
ultimate
american
wild
ale
experience
i
will
revisit
this
again
next
year
and
see
if
my
opinion
has
changed
i
been
hearing
how
good
this
beer
is
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
also
glad
the
price
i
paid
for
wasnt
wasted
its
a
wee
bit
up
there
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
sour
taste
the
carbonation
is
caused
by
the
refermenting
in
the
bottle
and
it
definitely
shows
in
the
glass
and
the
way
it
pops
in
your
mouth
i
could
drink
another
one
easily
but
im
gonna
have
to
break
my
piggy
bank
for
that
wow
look
at
the
fizz
of
that
second
pour
and
the
smell
this
is
good
i
would
like
to
thank
alot
of
the
people
on
ba
who
pretty
much
told
me
it
was
a
good
deal
to
get
this
otherwise
i
might
have
forgotten
about
it
thankyou
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
sort
of
beer
which
has
a
lot
in
common
with
an
oud
bruin
and
its
generally
not
the
sort
of
thing
id
reach
for
if
given
many
other
choices
but
the
quality
and
character
is
clearly
on
a
high
level
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
really
gotta
be
in
the
mood
to
drink
a
sour
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
i
would
never
go
for
a
sour
it
is
good
for
the
style
but
that
i
think
will
always
be
the
case
just
a
fabulous
outrageously
tart
acidic
wild
ale
black
fruit
dominates
obviously
driven
by
the
black
currant
with
full
bodied
berry
tart
cherry
black
raspberry
and
plum
thickly
tart
with
brett
and
a
bit
tannic
from
the
oak
mouthfeel
is
a
blast
of
spritzy
carbonation
and
acidity
brett
shows
well
throughout
and
keeps
things
fresh
wish
i
could
afford
more
of
these
d
drinkability
is
inhibited
by
the
intensity
of
the
acidity
which
is
really
accentuated
by
the
tartness
of
the
currants
of
course
its
delicious
although
not
my
favorite
rr
beer
but
difficult
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
m
amazingly
fast
fading
deep
tan
bubbles
reach
three
fingers
and
then
fade
to
nothing
in
just
seconds
body
is
a
deep
brown
mahogany
tone
in
color
really
romantic
nose
is
lovely
with
up
front
raspberries
so
lush
and
slightly
tart
rich
dark
fruit
tones
come
through
with
some
oak
and
even
a
hint
of
sweet
bourbon
with
first
sip
you
get
some
vanilla
and
oak
then
quickly
comes
the
tannin
based
dark
fruit
sour
feel
that
really
embraces
the
tongue
completely
raisins
figs
blackberries
and
citrus
rind
all
mark
a
wonderful
tart
fruit
profile
the
bold
almost
rich
tannin
feel
really
rounds
out
the
taste
perfectly
superb
balance
and
complexity
make
this
beer
a
real
standout
mouthfeel
is
very
red
wine
like
really
making
you
want
the
next
sip
off
the
chart
drinkability
for
a
beer
in
this
category
very
enjoyable
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
another
rr
winner
drinkability
for
a
10
its
excellent
could
drink
it
all
night
definitely
warms
you
up
quickly
however
and
would
be
tough
to
drink
the
whole
thing
on
my
lonesome
abv
wise
eventually
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
wild
ales
are
quickly
becoming
my
new
favorite
style
while
expensive
its
certainly
worthy
and
fantastic
and
more
than
just
an
enjoyable
brew
but
an
excellent
one
d
quite
nice
and
very
drinkable
going
well
with
pizza
definitely
could
have
more
of
this
very
good
m
d
starts
quite
carbonated
though
this
calms
the
more
i
swirl
it
naturally
the
flavours
hold
on
for
quite
a
while
and
the
warming
on
the
way
down
makes
for
a
pleasant
sipper
a
great
beer
with
plenty
of
complexity
to
keep
the
nose
and
palate
busy
when
you
let
this
beer
warm
a
bit
and
allow
the
carbonation
to
settle
down
it
turns
out
to
be
pretty
good
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
wasnt
as
amazed
as
i
expected
to
be
considering
the
hype
but
i
did
like
it
im
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
price
tag
but
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
different
batches
to
see
any
differences
overall
this
was
a
very
good
awa
and
my
first
foray
into
rr
sours
a
good
way
to
start
this
is
a
hell
of
an
interesting
thing
the
lady
friend
was
startled
she
had
no
idea
beer
could
taste
like
this
i
am
really
enjoying
it
just
a
funky
weird
crazy
thing
going
on
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
am
trying
not
to
drink
this
treat
fast
but
it
that
isnt
happening
very
well
very
drinkable
and
i
want
more
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
had
yet
a
little
fizzy
but
i
like
how
the
tartness
puckers
and
dries
you
up
goes
down
way
too
easy
for
10
maybe
the
batch
i
got
was
overoaked
would
definitely
love
to
split
a
750ml
of
this
sometime
split
a
bottle
with
abfraser
last
night
at
cheeky
monk
in
denver
by
the
way
great
price
for
a
bar
26
this
is
my
third
time
drinking
consecration
now
and
i
love
it
dark
brown
with
a
red
tinge
i
assume
from
the
currants
its
brewed
with
plenty
o
head
crisp
tart
smell
a
very
dry
beer
though
not
as
dry
as
i
remember
batch
1
being
but
maybe
i
just
forgot
tart
but
not
crazy
sour
like
an
isabelle
proximus
or
beatification
nor
is
there
a
great
deal
of
funk
plenty
of
fruit
flavors
as
well
so
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
was
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
night
sitting
out
on
the
sidewalk
im
grateful
that
rr
is
now
distributed
in
colorado
drinkability
was
great
d
virtually
invisible
alcohol
content
characteristically
awesome
thanks
joe
very
good
beer
cant
say
that
im
as
enamored
of
it
as
the
general
ba
population
but
i
understand
the
appeal
a
wonderful
onceinawhile
treat
the
yeast
used
bretanomyces
also
adds
some
earthy
flavors
to
the
mix
this
is
then
counterbalanced
by
the
bright
sourness
produced
by
the
bacterias
lactobacilius
and
pediococcus
fwiw
that
kind
of
sourness
i
can
only
relate
to
candy
like
sour
patch
kids
but
the
sourness
has
a
lot
of
flavors
competing
for
attention
this
brew
has
some
real
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
highly
recommended
loved
it
pours
a
rich
plum
color
with
some
glowing
red
hues
and
a
light
fluffy
tan
colored
head
that
quickly
burns
out
into
a
nice
thin
wispy
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
filled
with
tart
berries
touches
of
oak
and
just
a
plain
overall
sour
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
with
tart
berries
being
the
first
thing
you
taste
and
eventually
allows
for
some
oak
and
touches
of
earthy
hops
to
shine
through
and
finishes
very
dry
its
a
very
effervescent
beer
and
is
light
bodied
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
it
has
very
nice
sourness
which
doesnt
blast
you
away
but
definitely
makes
you
pucker
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
arent
careful
as
this
is
an
easy
drinker
lovely
delicious
stuff
d
i
am
always
down
for
a
wild
ale
but
the
guys
i
spilt
it
with
were
not
fans
of
wild
ales
and
wanted
me
to
crack
open
another
one
if
only
i
had
another
i
would
have
good
job
russian
river
and
great
job
mike
for
getting
this
wonderful
beer
to
me
j
quite
drinkable
but
fizzes
up
a
lot
on
the
tongue
i
guess
the
way
its
produced
like
a
sparkling
wine
will
do
that
and
is
normal
but
this
is
a
sipper
very
drinkable
and
as
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
am
further
understanding
it
and
i
must
say
with
this
one
i
am
truly
floored
at
how
well
put
together
and
complex
it
is
a
great
sour
wild
ale
from
russian
river
d
incredible
you
would
never
know
the
abv
strength
of
this
beer
as
the
alcohol
is
completely
covered
by
the
wonderful
taste
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
falls
quickly
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sour
with
a
vinous
and
vinegar
thing
going
on
in
a
good
way
also
has
notes
of
cherriescurrants
grapes
and
wood
the
flavor
is
like
a
great
mix
of
sour
cherries
and
a
touch
of
apple
cider
vinegar
very
complex
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
style
is
way
out
there
for
me
like
i
stated
earlier
this
is
my
first
time
trying
an
american
wild
ale
took
me
a
while
to
drink
it
but
made
my
way
through
it
with
no
problems
taking
a
few
sips
of
ice
water
between
sips
of
beer
made
it
a
bit
more
bearable
im
always
willing
to
try
anything
from
russian
river
so
i
couldnt
pass
this
one
up
would
i
go
back
to
it
again
if
i
found
it
probably
not
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
a
bad
beer
in
my
eyes
when
i
become
more
familiar
with
this
style
i
may
have
it
again
and
rereview
it
overall
a
very
good
sour
ale
batch
001x2
bottle
corked
and
caged
purchased
from
monks
cafe
4
months
ago
the
beer
is
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
1finger
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
much
darker
than
i
initially
expected
the
aroma
is
sour
and
acidic
with
a
strong
raisin
character
theres
much
more
dark
fruit
than
i
normally
get
in
a
wild
ale
i
think
i
smell
plums
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
also
i
like
everything
about
the
aroma
except
the
alcohol
maybe
it
cant
be
helped
due
to
the
high
abv
the
taste
is
not
as
sour
as
feared
or
hoped
but
crisply
tart
lots
of
raisins
plums
some
sweet
and
tart
cherries
very
very
good
more
inyourface
than
belgian
wild
ales
this
has
more
evident
alcohol
and
bolder
flavors
overall
medium
body
but
the
rich
flavors
and
threat
of
10
tempers
the
drinkability
a
bit
so
far
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
wild
ales
it
is
very
sour
but
yet
still
has
nice
sweetness
and
great
complexity
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
wilds
from
russian
river
d
slow
drinking
due
to
the
mouthpuckering
tartness
still
managed
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
over
the
course
of
an
evening
though
very
tasty
thanks
again
to
max
and
vinnie
for
making
this
happen
overall
i
dont
see
many
sours
coming
close
to
this
vinnie
hits
it
on
the
head
once
again
may
be
arguably
the
best
to
come
out
of
santa
rosa
ever
color
is
dark
amber
with
small
lacing
head
was
think
on
pour
nose
has
barnyard
coffee
fruit
and
a
hint
of
perfume
taste
was
strong
sour
with
hay
and
fruit
flavor
finishing
with
a
hint
of
tannin
and
bread
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
a
10
ounce
pour
will
do
the
trick
excellent
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
russian
river
really
knows
what
they
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
sours
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
of
them
d
abv
well
hidden
tartness
does
not
tire
easily
think
i
am
getting
used
to
fine
sours
that
being
said
this
is
an
incredibly
unique
beer
that
explores
the
boundaries
of
what
beer
can
be
i
loved
it
and
was
very
sad
when
i
reached
the
bottom
of
my
6
oz
pour
will
definitely
drink
again
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
but
to
me
compunction
supplication
and
toronado
are
far
superior
you
cant
go
wrong
but
for
the
heafty
price
tag
id
rather
drink
a
rodenbach
red
cheers
deep
dark
ruby
redbrown
with
a
nice
light
brownred
foam
forming
to
top
off
this
brew
aromas
of
berries
the
currants
are
there
for
sure
cherries
a
peppery
spiciness
with
a
prickly
carbonation
complex
funk
mixes
with
vinous
red
wine
grape
characteristics
another
winner
from
russian
river
itll
be
great
for
years
to
come
very
slight
alcohol
burn
from
the
high
abv
but
it
is
not
distracting
from
the
brilliant
marriage
of
tart
funk
and
fruit
that
take
place
in
this
beer
chris
how
the
fuck
do
you
not
like
this
pours
a
clear
translucent
brown
color
with
a
full
finger
fizzy
light
tan
head
that
is
gone
in
a
blink
no
belgian
lacing
afterward
the
smell
is
great
sweet
apple
over
a
wine
vinegar
full
flavored
the
taste
and
nose
are
mirror
images
granny
smith
apple
ale
flavor
and
tartness
with
a
light
body
over
an
effervescent
mouth
feel
that
dries
up
quickly
while
leaving
the
fruity
earthy
notes
and
hint
of
a
dark
fruit
linger
nicely
a
way
too
easy
drinker
the
10
abv
provides
a
notch
of
warmth
with
the
first
mouthful
but
is
quite
well
integrated
i
will
savor
this
one
as
long
as
i
can
highly
recommended
d
not
a
problem
to
drink
at
all
sometimes
i
have
a
problem
with
some
sours
and
wilds
but
this
one
is
easy
to
take
care
of
actually
refreshing
as
hell
and
has
a
nice
and
light
drinkable
quality
never
have
a
problem
taking
another
pull
a
well
crafted
beer
from
start
to
finish
sure
i
could
use
a
bit
more
head
and
lace
but
screw
it
the
flavor
aroma
and
feel
more
than
make
up
for
that
lack
drink
it
if
you
got
it
great
beer
by
far
the
best
sour
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
even
better
or
equal
to
the
belgian
sours
if
you
enjoy
sours
then
you
absolutely
must
seek
this
one
out
drinkability
4
5
still
damn
drinkable
what
can
i
say
its
incredible
im
going
to
strictly
edit
myself
in
this
review
so
i
dont
get
too
gushy
giving
two
4
5s
feels
wrong
and
the
five
in
flavor
seems
a
bit
low
at
any
rate
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
auburn
with
nice
lacing
there
are
notes
of
red
wine
currants
of
course
cherries
malt
and
a
wonderful
sour
like
an
incredible
vinegar
the
flavor
is
similar
the
sour
bites
nicely
theres
actual
malt
presence
behind
all
of
the
fruit
and
sourness
the
fruit
flavors
are
refined
and
elegant
the
whole
thing
is
a
wonderful
experience
i
cant
imagine
how
they
could
improve
on
this
flavor
profile
the
sourness
blends
with
the
fruit
and
malt
at
just
the
right
level
theres
also
a
dry
oak
flavor
that
keeps
any
possible
sweetness
in
check
it
drinks
like
a
beer
with
half
as
much
alcohol
content
bravo
to
everyone
at
russian
river
poured
this
one
into
a
tulip
glass
that
looked
like
dark
raspbeery
rust
with
an
off
white
head
lacing
and
some
sticky
foam
big
fruit
nose
you
wouldnt
believe
from
the
currant
notes
of
tart
cherries
esters
and
red
wine
im
a
gueuze
fan
so
the
sourness
hit
the
spot
flavors
of
sour
cherries
oak
funk
and
some
dry
hops
is
in
the
background
feels
like
a
lightly
carbonated
red
wine
which
made
every
sip
one
to
remember
hats
off
to
russian
river
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
nice
but
brief
head
with
a
dark
mahogany
body
smell
is
unsurprisingly
currants
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
really
where
this
beer
shines
wonderful
currant
with
an
extremely
tart
dry
bite
and
a
pleasant
champagne
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
beers
after
the
first
sip
im
glad
i
dont
live
in
the
bay
area
because
id
go
broke
drinking
this
bottle
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
good
off
white
fizzy
head
the
head
leaves
quickly
reminds
me
of
soda
pop
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
apples
cherries
and
a
touch
of
the
oak
has
a
good
carbonation
the
flavor
is
real
good
a
lot
of
sweetness
but
kicked
up
by
a
sour
ending
has
a
dry
texture
this
is
a
differnt
style
than
i
would
normally
drink
but
it
is
excellent
has
a
great
finish
and
the
aftertaste
stays
with
you
for
days
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
cost
a
little
more
than
i
spend
but
was
worth
it
this
is
far
and
beyond
my
favorite
beer
to
date
too
bad
its
so
hard
to
find
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
case
of
this
and
age
it
this
one
is
made
to
be
shared
just
awesome
this
is
the
reason
i
drink
beer
definately
need
an
open
mind
for
this
beermost
non
bas
need
not
apply
but
you
will
definately
reep
the
benefits
of
a
unique
and
delicious
beer
not
much
to
improve
on
only
wish
i
had
more
this
beer
may
be
the
finest
example
of
working
with
wild
yeast
and
bacteria
outstanding
d
holy
crap
this
was
my
2nd
beer
of
the
day
this
morning
the
first
was
pliny
the
younger
and
i
can
still
drink
more
batch
variation
seems
to
be
pretty
obvious
i
didnt
get
that
vague
plastic
smell
from
the
batch
001x4
bottles
ive
sampled
ill
comment
further
when
i
open
up
my
own
bottle
at
some
point
im
also
looking
forward
to
batch
002
hell
yes
d
wow
this
brew
is
amazing
so
earthy
and
drinkable
with
a
fantastic
fruity
quality
that
isnt
sweet
or
bitter
unlike
anything
ive
tasted
to
this
point
i
was
expecting
a
straight
up
sour
with
a
slight
fruity
dimension
but
not
so
awesome
stuff
thanks

thanks
carlos
and
greg
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
buy
it
one
of
the
better
sours
out
there
well
balanced
and
gives
a
nice
sour
flavor
without
being
overly
acidic
highly
recommended
drinkability
high
extremely
good
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
taste
is
awesome
nose
is
awesome
what
more
could
you
want
the
only
russian
river
brew
ive
tried
so
far
but
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
next
time
im
in
the
northwest
d
i
tried
to
age
this
a
bit
but
only
got
about
4
months
in
still
a
very
nice
balance
of
characteristics
the
beer
portions
won
out
enough
to
maintain
this
as
a
beer
overpriced
but
very
enjoyable
hard
to
chug
this
brew
but
with
a
25
price
tag
you
wanna
sip
on
this
brew
for
all
its
worth
looking
forward
to
having
some
more
of
this
draught
at
the
brewpub
brown
color
with
a
red
tint
and
white
head
darkly
vinous
tart
and
oaky
aroma
the
flavor
is
quite
sour
with
lots
of
oak
and
sour
fruit
malty
underneath
with
a
less
alcohol
that
i
was
expecting
richly
smooth
and
mediumfull
body
highgravity
sours
are
new
to
me
and
i
sort
of
miss
the
light
refreshing
quality
that
you
get
in
a
lighter
option
but
this
is
really
great
stuff
regardless
d
great
overall
not
sure
if
i
could
finish
a
whole
tulip
pour
overall
a
really
good
awa
from
rr
but
is
missing
a
couple
elements
from
being
a
classic
still
very
enjoyable
but
not
the
id
kill
my
mother
to
get
it
like
supplication
or
temptation
for
me
do
highly
recommend
ive
got
one
left
for
cellaring
so
curious
to
see
how
this
one
ages
a
great
beer
to
mark
100
on
ba
consecration
and
supplication
are
without
a
doubt
my
two
favorite
sours
from
russian
river
the
bottled
version
was
as
good
if
not
better
than
the
version
i
have
enjoyed
many
times
up
at
the
pub
in
santa
rosa
d
share
this
one
with
someone
an
ale
which
needs
to
be
experienced
by
many
this
ale
is
definitely
not
for
all
but
is
an
excellent
example
of
true
artistry
at
work
beers
and
breweries
like
this
give
me
hope
for
the
industry
and
make
me
proud
to
say
i
am
a
beer
drinker
and
maker
thumbs
up
for
originality
and
passion
my
hat
is
off
to
you
vinnie
dgood
the
bomber
was
ok
but
more
would
be
tough
given
the
sweetness
personal
preference
and
the
alcohol
in
some
ways
winelike
but
with
a
funky
malty
character
wellbalanced
sweet
and
sour
but
not
too
much
in
one
direction
an
interesting
delicious
unique
sipper
d
huge
thanks
to
rallison
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
think
rr
achieved
exactly
what
they
set
out
to
do
with
this
one
the
acid
ensures
a
crisp
dry
finish
really
nice
on
the
tongue
warm
and
very
pleasant
overall
this
is
an
amazing
sour
and
an
extremely
flavorful
example
of
russian
rivers
ability
thank
you
brian
for
trading
this
gem
to
me
d
definitely
the
most
drinkable
sour
that
i
have
had
very
complex
and
also
soothing
on
the
palate
could
easily
down
this
one
quickly
but
it
would
be
such
a
shame
to
get
to
the
end
any
faster
than
necessary
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
makes
you
want
to
go
back
and
rethink
some
previous
ratings
completely
redefined
what
the
style
can
be
d
so
far
this
my
favorite
sour
by
far
wish
and
one
that
i
can
actually
drink
and
not
gag
wild
ales
are
not
usually
my
bag
but
how
can
you
turn
down
a
healthy
and
free
6oz
pour
im
glad
i
did
this
stuff
is
incredible
perhaps
it
was
the
muted
funkiness
that
i
loved
so
much
but
russian
river
continues
to
do
no
wrong
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
ive
tried
i
would
not
want
to
drink
this
all
the
time
but
as
something
occasional
to
mix
things
up
it
works
well
this
beer
isnt
cheap
but
its
probably
worth
having
one
or
two
in
the
cellar
drinkability
im
not
a
huge
sour
fan
but
i
had
to
try
this
one
definitely
a
pleasant
beer
though
the
tart
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
at
times
if
it
wasnt
20
a
bottle
i
would
probably
revisit
this
md
full
bodied
with
an
incredibly
lively
carbonation
the
beer
tickles
your
mouth
and
throat
the
whole
way
down
ridiculously
easy
drinking
as
well
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
so
i
popped
the
cock
and
prepared
to
drink
this
bottle
batch
001x4
a
couple
of
hours
before
a
big
stl
blues
playoff
game
pours
light
brown
with
a
tancreamy
head
into
my
duvel
tulip
not
much
lacing
along
the
glass
and
the
head
quickly
goes
away
leaving
a
small
tan
rim
along
the
sides
of
the
tulip
the
smell
is
amazing
green
apples
very
sour
but
in
a
great
way
taste
is
great
lippuckering
sour
but
its
just
as
if
im
drinking
a
nice
cabernet
or
pinot
noir
wow
lots
of
fruit
up
front
and
a
great
mix
of
sweetness
and
tart
on
the
finish
makes
me
want
more
mouthfeel
is
perfect
just
the
correct
amount
of
carbonation
with
this
wild
really
helps
the
flavors
i
would
say
this
is
right
down
the
middle
in
terms
of
body
medium
drinks
like
a
wine
with
some
carbonation
very
nice
i
still
have
a
few
bottles
left
and
they
wont
be
around
too
long
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
this
one
an
awesome
wild
very
very
smooth
feel
light
astringency
definitely
not
unpleasant
leaves
a
very
nice
tingle
on
the
tongue
nice
even
coating
made
me
feel
like
i
needed
to
brush
my
teeth
afterward
i
was
really
sad
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
glass
for
my
first
wild
ale
i
thought
it
was
highly
drinkable
i
really
hope
ill
be
able
to
attain
this
sometime
over
the
summer
it
doesnt
take
long
to
realize
that
this
is
indeed
a
10
sledgehammer
but
there
is
nothing
that
can
diminish
how
good
this
thing
is
my
cellar
awaits
for
another
bottle
what
will
this
taste
like
in
a
few
years
i
am
drinking
this
very
slowly
but
i
am
enjoying
every
sip
not
that
im
a
sour
maven
by
any
means
but
this
is
the
best
one
ive
experienced
to
date
infuckingcredible
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
funky
chewy
with
barnyard
funk
sticking
to
the
palate
hv
overall
a
pretty
onedimensional
sour
but
boy
does
it
do
the
sour
well
this
is
right
up
there
with
la
folie
for
my
favorite
sour
batch
001x4
another
amazingly
artistic
beer
from
russian
river
trying
for
the
second
time
a
deep
garnet
color
calm
looking
brew
this
beer
is
both
complex
yet
accessible
and
quite
easy
to
drink
all
at
the
same
time
tartness
and
raisiny
currents
in
the
nose
a
big
of
soaked
woodsy
oak
at
first
taste
this
beer
has
a
tart
but
not
necessarily
very
sour
kick
to
it
then
mellowing
into
deep
fruit
and
a
soft
funk
very
balanced
and
subtle
yet
plenty
of
flavor
and
very
arousing
to
the
tastebuds
slight
grape
husk
vinous
character
imparted
from
the
barrel
aging
really
excellent
prickly
and
juicy
on
the
palate
but
with
a
tart
dry
finish
and
highly
quaffable
a
real
gem
i
understand
that
brett
was
used
along
with
two
other
usual
suspects
but
i
could
not
discern
any
obvious
rotting
humus
or
bovid
urine
rather
just
the
usual
organic
yeast
remnants
d
i
split
a
750ml
bottle
with
two
friends
and
i
wanted
more
after
13
of
the
bottle
overall
extremely
wellrounded
one
of
the
few
american
wilds
that
ive
had
thats
not
sour
for
the
sake
of
being
sour
but
sour
to
impart
flavor
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
another
excellent
brew
by
rr
d
this
one
was
very
drinkable
it
definitely
wasnt
a
standout
for
me
as
far
as
russian
rivers
lineup
goes
id
much
rather
grab
a
temptation
at
22
dollars
a
bottle
id
venture
to
guess
this
will
be
the
last
bottle
ill
buy
for
a
while
this
is
a
top
ten
beer
for
me
no
doubt
delicious
and
creative
worthy
of
the
awe
it
inspires
my
first
crack
at
a
wild
or
sour
beer
but
it
was
a
great
new
experience
the
pour
yields
a
cloudy
glowing
rusty
sienna
colored
body
with
a
lasting
pillowy
cream
colored
head
minimal
spotty
lacing
shows
on
the
glass
aromas
include
a
dark
fruity
malt
base
rich
with
currants
and
some
sour
cherry
dry
cocoa
adds
a
hint
of
sweetness
while
soft
oaky
vanilla
lends
a
perfumy
lightly
woody
overtone
traces
of
bretty
funk
add
an
earthy
character
flavors
show
more
dark
fruits
primarily
tart
dark
cherry
fig
and
currant
mild
sourness
being
tempered
by
the
soft
oaky
carress
the
body
is
substantial
and
semidry
perfectly
carbonated
i
think
i
may
have
another
style
of
beer
to
add
to
my
list
very
dry
mouth
astringent
light
to
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
as
dry
as
some
champagne
ive
had
which
for
me
is
not
a
positive
quality
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
make
for
the
hills
ride
do
not
look
back
at
the
looming
thunderstorms
they
are
not
there
ride
your
freedom
is
at
stake
your
entire
world
you
must
not
let
them
catch
you
ride
for
your
life
i
cant
believe
this
is
10
abv
it
is
completely
concealed
i
would
love
to
continue
on
to
another
bottle
when
i
finish
this
one
but
this
is
far
too
precious
a
beer
to
treat
in
such
a
frivolous
manner
d
the
10
alcohol
never
rears
its
head
the
ale
is
very
approachable
with
a
pleasant
tartness
that
never
makes
me
pucker
too
much
i
could
drink
this
again
and
again
and
again
however
this
ranks
behind
supplication
and
beatification
for
me
o
best
wild
ale
yet
i
think
at
some
point
i
will
be
able
to
appreciate
this
style
but
its
too
radical
to
me
right
now
to
feel
comfortable
with
it
i
can
totally
see
how
people
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
though
but
i
think
its
an
acquired
taste
that
i
just
havent
acquired

this
beer
poured
a
mahognay
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
fizzy
highly
carbonated
twofinger
thick
head
of
tan
foam
that
quickly
settled
into
a
lasting
cap
some
slippery
lacing
the
aroma
included
strong
oak
vinous
dark
fruits
and
lightly
sweetened
tart
currants
some
lightly
sour
notes
definately
a
strong
wine
character
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
the
flavor
displayed
a
fairly
intense
oaky
wine
barrel
character
tart
currants
followed
by
a
mellow
acidity
a
lingering
woody
cherry
pit
note
was
left
on
the
tongue
the
10
abv
was
undetected
finished
mostly
dry
but
there
was
still
some
unexpected
sweetness
lingering
mediumbodied
with
crisp
aggressive
carbonation
very
well
done
quite
a
bit
more
tart
and
not
nearly
as
sour
as
expected
but
it
works
a
wonderful
beer
md
overall
i
think
this
is
an
amazing
brew
im
just
getting
into
liking
sours
and
this
one
is
a
hit
for
me
another
wild
work
of
art
here
the
melding
of
the
oak
cherries
and
wild
yeasts
in
this
was
just
fantastic
and
the
drinkibility
was
quite
good
for
a
beer
of
this
size
awesome
thanks
for
reading
d
this
is
a
really
good
wild
yeast
ale
the
aging
served
it

drinkability
more
of
a
treat
than
a
session
beer
but
dont
pass
this
one
up
if
you
can
get
it
on
tap
or
aged
for
1
years
overall
definitely
an
amazing
brew
that
everyone
should
try
not
something
i
can
see
myself
drinking
regularly
but
more
like
a
celebration
brew
to
break
out
on
special
occasions
im
definitely
interested
in
cellaring
this
and
trying
it
a
couple
years
down
the
line
i
had
this
on
tap
today
at
capones
it
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
cherrys
and
red
wine
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sour
but
full
of
cherry
currants
and
a
dry
red
wine
the
brew
is
full
bodied
and
very
dry
possibly
from
the
tannins
in
the
wine
barrels
the
beer
is
a
definit
sipper
but
i
am
very
suprised
about
the
10
abv
this
is
the
best
sour
i
have
had
and
i
consider
myself
fortunate
for
being
able
to
try
it
dsuperb
quite
drinkable
well
done
sour
with
the
tart
and
dry
characteristics
balancing
each
other
very
well
a
totally
enjoyable
and
refreshing
brew
d
quite
drinkable
for
one
of
the
most
coveted
americanmade
sour
ales
in
beerlure
while
this
is
a
brettheads
dream
i
actually
found
it
to
be
not
as
harsh
as
i
was
anticipating
really
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
get
this
on
tap
outside
of
cali
over
all
i
thought
this
was
quite
tasty
but
not
as
impressive
than
other
wild
ales
especially
those
offered
by
rr
the
big
downfall
for
me
was
the
carbonation
maybe
i
should
just
swirl
my
glass
for
a
few
minutes
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
shocked
that
i
got
a
16
oz
pour
when
i
was
expecting
a
10
but
it
was
a
bargain
at
6

dark
cherry
red
pour
with
a
hazy
tan
head
that
lingers
very
sour
aroma
of
cherries
and
plums
with
a
light
vinous
smell
to
it
as
well
the
flavor
is
like
a
sour
fruit
explosion
in
your
face
cherries
grapes
blackberries
and
a
nice
wine
thickness
very
nice
carbonation
in
the
mouth
and
a
nice
malt
profile
as
well
hopefully
my
future
experiences
with
sours
will
match
up
to
this
one
drinkability
its
hard
not
to
gulp
this
one
down
like
a
madman
all
in
all
this
is
one
excellent
beer
layered
with
rich
complexities
and
one
that
i
cheerfully
recommend
overall
impression
another
great
wild
offering
from
russian
river
it
is
amazing
that
we
can
get
these
in
colorado

poured
into

duvel

forms
a
lovely
3
finger
head
frenzied
carbonation
feeds
the
head
then
a
truly
unique
phenomenon
begins
to
unveil
itself
the
beer
begins
to
make
crackling
sounds
just
like
a
bowl
of
rice
krispies
the
head
holds
along
with
the
crackling
sounds
for
a
couple
of
minutes
but
then
quickly
vanishes
once
i
start
drinking
the
appearance
and
sounds
of
this
beer
was
quite
an
amazing
experience
never
felt
like
a
beer
was
as
alive
as
this
one
beer
is
a
gorgeous
dark
burgundy
color
as
well
the
color
especially
the
crackle
make
this
a
5
for
me
smell
of
dark
fruit
cherries
apples
brett
and
a
little
vinegar
initial
taste
is
sour
and
tart
but
then
it
is
balanced
out
quickly
by
some
malts
beer
is
tremendously
complex
the
finish
is
long
lasting
and
leaves
you
longing
for
more
with
the
cabernet
sauvignon
grapes
lingering
very
nice
moutfeel
is
tantalizing
as
the
beer
dances
across
your
tongue
and
feels
as
alive
as
it
did
when
it
was
first
poured
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
could
probably
handle
no
more
than
2
a
lot
of
hype
with
this
beer
and
ill
say
for
the
most
part
it
lived
up
to
it
imo
im
aging
a
couple
of
other
bottles
and
i
imagine
they
will
improve
quite
a
bit
will
revisit
in
a

years

my
150th
review
on
st
patricks
day
with
corned
beef
brisket
and
grilled
vegetables
sacrament
or
sacrifice
communion
or
condemnation
this
beer
is
truly
unique
drinks
both
steadily
and
dangerously
settled
into
some
spirit
caravan
and
metallica
had
a
bottle
of
this
the
other
night
for
a
tasting
pours
a
dark
cola
burgundy
into
a
snifter
carbonation
is
clearly
scene
but
not
overwhelmingly
minimal
head
retention
with
a
small
but
nice
amount
of
lace
the
aromas
coming
form
the
beer
are
very
complex
black
currants
cherrys
and
tobacco
every
so
slightly
was
a
mind
opening
taste
for
everyone
at
the
tasting
and
actually
for
a
couple
people
their
first
addiction
taste
is
a
sour
that
leaves
your
mouth
a
bit
dry
flavors
of
cherrys
were
dominate
for
me
not
others
with
black
currants
and
a
hint
of
oak
in
the
back
ground
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
sours
but
this
beer
did
well
for
being
a
sour
and
converted
people
in
the
tasting
to
sour
lovers
mouth
feel
is
like
drinking
a
very
dry
and
tart
wine
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
some
was
used
int
he
brewing
this
type
of
beer
is
definitely
a
slow
and
sip
drink
at
least
for
me
it
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
would
recomend
anyone
to
give
it
a
try
at
least
once
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
crisp
smoothness
that
runs
throughout
each
sip
good
steady
carbonation
throughout
a
contemplative
sipper
of
a
beer
let
it
meander
its
way
across
your
palate
with
each
sip
to
get
as
many
as
the
nuances
as
possible
complex
tasty
and
a
masterpiece
of
the
brewing
and
barrel
aging
art
chalk
this
up
to
one
of
my
favorite
russian
river
creations
yet
draught
catalyst
coffee
light
brown
color
full
layered
foam
nose
is
perhaps
the
weakest
point
of
the
beer
but
still
hints
of
funk
wood
dark
fruit
flavor
is
amazing
complex
integrated
beautifully
balanced
notes
of
cranberry
currant
blackberry
and
wood
a
beauty
and
one
to
put
away
d
pretty
high
i
could
drink
several
but
acid
reflux
would
probably
kick
in
its
a
bit
pricy
to
be
very
drinkable
though
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
but
once
was
enough
for
me
this
remind
me
a
lot
of
supplication
with
the
most
noticeable
difference
for
me
being
the
different
wine
barrels
the
two
beers
are
aged
in
i
like
what
the
cab
does
to
amp
this
beer
up
you
know
i
wish
an
east
coast
brewer
made
some
sours
of
this
caliber
that
way
i
wouldnt
have
to
either
pay
an
arm
and
a
leg
or
wait
months
to
find
them
overall
good
sour
dry
feel
with
a
nice
black
currant
flavor
1
or
2
would
be
good
at
dessert
a
def
sipper
along
with
ommegang
rouge
the
best
interpretation
of
a
belgian
sour
that
i
have
had
just
remarkable
i
have
tried
a
number
of
these
beers
in
the
last
year
or
two
but
this
one
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
if
you
like
sour
go
for
it
but
if
you
are
not
devoted
to
this
style
try
something
less
intense
i
couldnt
finish
it
this
stuff
is
very
intense
it
has
a
very
tightly
concentrated
sour
flavor
that
will
take
you
by
surprise
if
your
not
ready
for
it
very
sour
up
front
and
then
the
flavor
spreads
out
a
bit
the
10
abv
is
completely
hidden
by
red
fruit
and
spice
after
sipping
it
for
a
while
your
mouth
adjusts
to
the
intensity
and
if
you
like
sour
style
beers
this
will
do
the
trick
i
wonder
how
it
will
age
i
feel
that
with
some
time
the
beer
will
mellow
out
some
and
perhaps
be
more
approachable
all
things
considered
this
one
is
very
unique
and
worth
the
20
bones
notes
damn
this
is
one
hell
of
a
ride
very
fruity
very
sour
very
funky
very
intoxicating
and
very
good
another
perfect
example
of
why
people
go
apeshit
over
vinnies
concoctions
if
you
love
sours
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
get
a
hold
of
this
one
highly
recommended
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
get
your
hands
on
this
you
will
not
be
dissapointed
awesome
amazing
beer
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
for
the
experience
this
beer
deserves
the
praises
and
ratings
it
has
received
very
well
done
from
one
of
my
favorite
nor
cal
breweries
more
recent
bottles
indicate
some
signs
of
wine
oxidationstewed
fruit
nevertheless
if
you
consider
yourself
a
sour
fiend
and
enjoy
fruited
ales
do
yourself
a
favor
and
seek
this
one
out
killer
beer
keep
in
mind
i
wrote
this
at
the
brewery
towards
the
end
of
a
very
long
russian
river
day
thought
i
should
rewrite
it
a
month
later
and
laugh
about
it
again
md
really
solid
the
carbonation
matches
very
well
light
crisp
feel
that
seems
like
a
combination
between
a
fine
cab
sav
and
a
fantastic
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
try
it
with
some
jalapeno
jack
cheese
d
very
easy
to
drink
almost
too
drinkable
but
after
3
6oz
glasses
it
does
start
to
get
a
bit
heavy
in
your
stomach
but
it
is
still
tasty
to
say
the
least
and
super
drinkable
for
10
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
can
hardly
even
taste
the
alcohol
this
was
an
amazing
beer
for
me
definitely
gonna
be
looking
for
many
more
sours
now
well
worth
the
23
dollar
price
tag
finally
a
big
thank
you
goes
out
to
the
wine
underground
in
englewood
co
for
making
this
available
online
flavor
is
tart
sour
fruity
acidic
oaky
and
altogether
complex
besides
being
a
big
sour
ale
the
flavors
are
a
bit
difficult
to
describe
and
really
require
an
individual
palate
test
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
supported
by
some
fine
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
that
masks
it
10
abv
it
would
go
well
with
some
tender
hoofed
wild
game
dgood
but
im
shocked
to
see
i
prefer
the
rr
in
the
shootout
the
oakiness
is
a
bit
much
it
hasnt
gotten
overly
funky
like
id
hope
with
the
age
and
the
depth
doesnt
match
the
rr
i
like
a
sweeter
beer
or
more
sour
but
the
aged
dd
reminds
me
of
the
disappointing
05
abbaye
de
saint
bonchien
i
had
on
xmas
eve
which
was
also
over
oaked
and
not
that
sour
insanely
drinkable
still
waiting
to
try
a
bad
beer
from
russian
river
the
cork
was
the
loudest
cork
ive
ever
heard
and
damn
near
flew
out
of
my
hand
when
i
opened
it
the
instant
sour
fruit
smell
was
heavenley
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
the
taste
is
absurdly
complex
so
much
so
im
sure
you
could
find
almost
any
flavor
you
looked
for
this
and
the
brabant
have
mad
me
officaly
change
my
favorite
style
from
ris
to
american
wild
an
absolute
must
have
for
an
ba
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
root
beer
color
with
a
deep
amber
tinge
dark
but
mostly
clear
nice
beige
head
fizzles
out
due
to
the
acidity
aroma
is
sour
raisins
and
currants
with
a
striking
cabernet
character
that
blends
into
the
overall
profile
better
than
any
other
wine
barrelaged
beer
ive
had
a
brown
sugar
note
emerges
once
my
nose
acclimates
to
the
acidity
of
the
aroma
maybe
even
a
little
bourbon
and
light
alcohol
too
very
complex
smell
flavors
of
jammy
wine
berries
raisins
oak
vinegar
brown
sugar
and
a
bunch
more
i
cant
even
articulate
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
up
ridiculous
complexity
all
around
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
well
carbonated
with
delicate
bubbles
a
joy
to
drink
rr
just
cant
miss
d
very
light
and
dry
minimal
to
no
aftertaste
huge
drinkability
d
consecration
is
an
amazing
beer
highly
drinkable
i
can
not
wait
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
stuff
and
see
how
it
evolves
with
some
cellaring
drinkability
i
cant
really
tell
theres
any
alcohol
in
this
its
10
but
you
wouldnt
know
it
its
definitely
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
one
of
the
few
wild
ales
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
the
other
being
ommegeddon
which
i
rated
b
pours
a
deep
dark
almost
blood
red
with
a
quick
and
quite
loud
bubbly
two
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
pillowy
layer
of
foam
that
lasts
throughout
virtually
nothing
in
terms
of
lacing
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
there
aroma
is
heavenly
tart
fruits
wet
tobacco
leaves
and
rhubarb
underneath
the
funk
is
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
oak
with
some
dark
grapes
and
fig
as
well
taste
begins
with
some
leafy
greens
dates
and
brett
midway
a
bit
of
alcohol
comes
to
the
surface
with
a
woody
oak
flavor
and
some
vinegar
aftertaste
is
where
the
sweetness
lingers
bitter
cocoa
nibs
dark
berries
and
leather
just
a
complex
orgasm
for
the
tongue
mmmhmmm
pretty
light
and
fluffy
for
a
beer
at
10
abv
im
blown
away
lively
puckering
carbonation
just
a
perfect
feel
in
the
mouth
just
a
wonderful
beer
still
no
deviation
but
another
sour
from
russian
river
that
definitely
needs
to
be
experienced
by
all
dont
miss
this
one
as
ive
said
before
consecration
is
to
wild
ales
what
the
younger
is
to
imperial
ipas
if
sours
werent
so
darn
polarizing
this
would
undoubtedly
be
on
the
top
10
great
beer
very
enjoyable
little
outright
funk
but
still
complex
and
interesting
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
with
some
age
on
it
had
this
on
tap
last
night
at
the
horse
brass
in
portland
oregon
delightfully
acetous
on
the
nose
on
the
palate
piquant
snappy
tannic
broodingly
acerbic
and
redolent
of
macerated
currants
exquisitely
tangy
on
the
back
of
the
palate
with
a
sappy
dryness
and
an
extraordinarily
long
finish
a
pleasure
to
drink
drinkability
is
exceptional
if
i
didnt
notice
the
bottle
i
would
have
never
guessed
this
beer
pushes
10
abv
it
drinks
more
like
a
6
or
7
beer
this
is
more
of
a
refined
sour
not
like
the
big
blast
of
sour
you
get
from
something
like
the
supplication
and
beautification
its
like
this
one
is
better
put
together
wow
yet
another
super
offering
from
vinnie
and
crew
its
currently
my
2
sour
from
them
sanctification
still
wins
by
a
nose
though
overall
beats
temptation
as
my
favorite
sour
to
date
in
the
mouth
tastes
like
champagne
to
me
with
apple
and
citrus
notes
i
enjoy
drinking
this
as
it
is
mellow
and
bubbly
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
the
price
to
drink
every
once
in
a
while
more
tasty
than
it
was
fresh
might
be
worth
saving
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
sours
as
for
as
drinkability
and
flavor
goes
edit
i
went
back
on
3509
and
finished
off
that
keg
only
a
glass
and
12
left
in
the
keg
my
only
real
knowledge
of
sours
was
with
la
folie
and
i
had
mixed
feelings
it
seemed
too
sour
and
difficult
to
enjoy
in
larger
servings
i
e
a
full
glass
consecration
has
a
more
rounded
balanced
feel
to
it
and
i
could
enjoy
the
entire
glass
without
feeling
like
it
was
a
burden
its
expensive
but
certainly
worth
it
for
a
special
treat
the
body
is
closer
to
moderate
than
dry
extremely
clean
for
being
so
much
on
the
abv
side
carbonation
is
low
but
ok
as
it
really
lets
all
the
different
flavors
come
out
just
really
impressed
with
the
balance
between
fruit
funk
and
sourness
overall
a
fantastic
beer
being
so
fresh
body
is
refreshing
yet
full
and
a
crisp
carbonation
enhances
the
vast
variety
of
flavors
nice
dry
finish
i
could
enjoy
this
ale
any
time
d
im
not
sure
what
to
say
about
this
beer
right
now
i
think
it
could
use
some
time
in
the
cellar
i
find
myself
longing
for
some
of
the
funky
brett
aromas
and
flavors
which
never
really
materialize
for
me
is
this
a
world
class
brew
certainly
but
i
would
take
a
cuvee
de
castleton
over
it
at
this
stage
of
ripeness
it
absolutely
pushes
the
envelope
in
blurring
the
lines
between
wine
and
beer
overall
this
beer
was
glorious
the
mouthfeel
was
highly
carbonated
and
perfect
the
10abv
was
absolutely
nowhere
to
be
found
and
i
am
glad
i
do
not
live
on
the
west
coast
for
once
otherwise
i
would
spend
my
whole
life
savings
on
this
beer
overall
i
was
totally
floored
by
this
one
one
of
the
best
beers
easily
a
top
three
to
five
i
have
ever
had
it
was
perfectly
blended
and
just
really
ungodly
drinkable
i
cannot
say
anything
else
instead
i
will
sit
back
and
simply
enjoy
this
one
again
this
beer
is
fucking
awesome
i
would
drink
this
beer
every
day
overall
a
great
beer
the
sour
and
fruity
notes
are
very
nicely
balanced
and
the
smell
was
impressive
as
well
i
cant
wait
to
cellar
one
of
these
and
try
it
again
a
must
try
cheers
a
bit
thin
in
the
middle
would
benefit
with
some
more
malt
dept
d
amazing
drinkablity
with
just
the
touch
of
sour
and
no
way
to
tell
its
high
in
alcohol
drinks
well
for
10
cant
taste
the
alcohol
too
much
else
going
on
doesnt
really
warm
on
the
way
down
either
its
very
sour
though
so
it
demands
drinking
it
pretty
slow
really
enjoyable
though
to
sip
on
all
night
the
warmer
it
gets
and
the
more
acclimated
your
tongue
gets
the
more
enjoyable
it
becomes
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
speak
for
themselves
i
would
happily
drink
these
till
i
couldnt
see
anymore
and
damn
near
did
this
was
there
best
beer
in
my
opinion
other
than
the
price
there
is
nothinhg
wrong
with
this
beer
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
beers
better
than
abyss
and
kbs
ive
ever
had
nb
had
the
newest
batch
on
472011
either
they
grow
much
more
sour
with
age
or
the
newer
bottles
are
much
less
sour
and
flavorfulbold
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
due
to
how
pricey
it
is
i
think
ill
invest
in
bottling
other
sours
glad
i
got
a
few
bottles
but
glad
i
did
not
purchase
an
entire
case
it
will
be
very
interesting
to
see
how
this
one
ages
a
bit
over
hyped
but
quite
delicious
and
an
enjoyable
experience
big
thanks
to
henry
for
bringing
this
to
our
tasting
pours
a
toffee
brown
with
little
head
that
quickly
becomes
a
pleasant
lacing
smell
is
sophisticated
currants
and
sour
notes
with
brett
taste
is
sticky
fruit
woody
oak
white
grapes
and
plumb
there
are
also
deep
sour
currants
finish
is
long
and
dry
with
a
lingering
sour
and
maybe
even
a
little
salt
well
blended
brew
very
good
d
not
gonna
say
this
is
the
greatest
thing
ive
ever
had
but
its
tasty
damn
tasty
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
level
of
tartsweet
refreshment
complex
enough
to
sit
and
savor
enjoyable
enough
to
have
another
even
two
if
it
werent

glad
to
have
tried

not

really
nice

dark

huge

sour

nice

body
dry

pretty
good
stuff
overall
impression
definitely
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
hopefully
the
supplication
and
temptation
i
recently
traded
for
are
better
this
much
brett
has
no
place
in
beer
at
least
not
the
beer
going
into
this
mouth
drinkability
is
high
and
usually
i
cant
drink
that
many
sours
in
a
row
but
i
could
drink
the
entire
750
by
myself
but
im
being
nice
and
sharing
it
with
a
buddy
glad
i
bought
a
couple
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
little
head
aromas
of
sour
fruit
woody
tannins
and
wine
characters
blend
well
with
dark
sour
fruit
flavors
oak
and
red
wine
a
drying
tart
finish
full
of
wonderfully
balanced
flavors
rounds
it
out
very
well
high
drinkability
for
a
beer
that
is
10
alcohol
you
would
never
know
it
i
could
drink
an
awful
lot
of
this
beer
and
thankfully
have
had
it
3
times
now
fantastic
huge
thanks
to
swnicholson
for
the
chance
to
try
this
gem
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
very
active
but
thin
head
smell
is
of
ripe
fruits
i
get
prunes
rasberry
and
the
like
some
sugary
alcohol
and
vinegar
as
well
taste
is
not
as
sour
as
i
had
imagined
really
smooth
flavor
actually
again
some
dark
fruits
and
smooth
rich
wine
flavor
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
some
active
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
overall
very
smooth
and
rich
not
my
fave
rr
but
very
good
this
is
going
to
be
a
tough
beer
to
find
but
trust
me
the
search
will
be
worth
it
this
is
one
of
those
breakthrough
beers
that
really
pushes
a
new
style
to
the
forefront
this
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
sour
with
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
vinous
this
is
the
closest
thing
ive
had
to
toronado
id
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
of
the
two
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
leads
to
a
damn
drinkable
strong
sour
im
glad
i
stocked
up
on
this
overall
i
have
loved
each
of
the
rr
sours
for
what
they
offer
and
amazingly
they
are
all
different
this
one
is
a
welcome
introduction
into
the
world
of
dark
sours
and
i
absolutely
loved
it
an
ace
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
except
for
the
fact
that
it
will
give
you
a
headache
from
the
acid
or
at
least
me
haha
taste
mouthfeel
tart
fruitiness
quickly
followed
by
woody
tannins
earth
and
dry
red
wine
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
are
present
beneath
it
all
the
last
remnants
of
salvation
perhaps
this
all
leads
into
a
tart
dry
and
juicy
finish
with
a
blast
of
black
currant
consecration
has
nailed
the
beerwine
hybrid
more
than
any
other
russian
river
beer
while
its
good
stuff
i
do
find
it
a
bit
overwhelming
9
times
out
of
10
id
rather
drink
supplication
or
temptation
a
good
sour
but
im
not
as
big
of
a
fan
as
everyone
else
seems
to
be
but
i
have
had
heard
several
accounts
say
the
bottled
version
is
ten
times
better
than
the
draft
version
i
sampled
maybe
i
need
to
sample
the
bottle
someday
for
its
optimal
performance
overall
great
rr
offering
that
i
will
be
stocked
up
on
for
a
while
if
i
can
resist
the
temptation
to
drink
so
far
i
am
not
doing
good
and
at
25
a
bottle
i
cannot
afford
any
more
d
another
great
tasting
sour
from
rr
you
have
to
be
able
to
appreciate
sours
to
appreciate
this
excellant
sour
i
have
only
recently
started
venturing
into
the
wonderful
world
of
sours
i
am
glad
to
have
had
this
opportunity
there
is
nothing
glamorous
about
this
beers
appearance
its
murky
maroonish
brown
looking
but
theres
nothing
really
off
putting
about
it
either
hence
its
fine
what
my
nose
and
tongue
pick
up
is
a
very
sour
cherrylike
presence
this
is
followed
by
a
dry
tannic
finish
very
woody
the
high
alcohol
is
not
really
noticeable
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
pretty
light
consistency
this
beer
is
so
easy
to
drink
its
dangerous
at
10
on
tap
at
russian
river
pours
dark
but
not
cloudy
just
shimmering
and
purple
to
deep
red
almost
no
head
just
a
ring
of
light
purple
bubbles
smells
of
tart
cherries
red
wine
esters
alcohol
nose
is
rich
and
inviting
taste
is
supremely
delicious
sour
winelike
fruit
flavor
lots
of
tart
cherries
lip
smackin
chocolate
malt
lingers
beneath
but
the
feature
is
the
big
sourness
thats
just
everywhere
i
also
get
some
currants
and
raspberries
in
there
too
sourness
doesnt
decrease
much
as
i
drink
more
which
ive
found
to
be
the
case
with
other
sours
it
just
sticks
around
and
makes
every
sip
a
great
and
interesting
experience
drinks
like
a
dream
a
fantastic
and
memorable
beer
as
i
continue
to
drink
this
the
theme
of
this
beer
is
balance
just
perfectly
in
harmony
na
zdrowie
d
effing
awesome
at
the
bar
i
gave
this
a
perfect
as
it
made
me
think
twice
about
getting
another
younger
but
it
ultimately
lost
i
will
have
this
every
chance
i
get
color
was
a
dark
burgundy
red
aroma
had
wine
and
fruit
notes
taste
was
great
not
too
sour
very
drinkable
lots
of

light
if
any

almost
no

noticeable
for

ill
be
trying
to
get
a
few
bottles
of
this
one
heavy
influence
of
currants
and
cabernet
oak
flavors
blue
and
red
berry

cassis
seemless
and
very

this
would
be

developing
more
complexities
edit
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
since
the
original
review
still
not
wowed
but
ive
found
myself
liking
it
more
and
more
upping
the

thanks
so
much
to
grant
for
sharing
this
wonderful
growler
with

rustydiamond
brickstoredave
ding
atlantabeerdog
and
saintnathanial
absolutely
delicious
and
a
great
pleasure
to
drink
this
with
friends
poured
a
garnet
tinged
amber
with
a
slight
head
beautiful
color
lovely
aromas
of
cherries
and
ruby
port
with
some
astringency
on
the
finish
tastes
tremendously
complex
with
cherries
a
little
bit
of
funk
quite
loamy
and
bitter
not
horseblanket
funk
but
an
earthier
forest
funk
quite
astringent
and
a
bit
of
sweet
licorice
on
the
finish
dark
and
brooding
with
wildly
interesting
flavors
quite
intriguing
smooth
tannic
and
sour
in
the
mouth
utterly
delicious
and
fascinating
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
amazing
beer
d
i
had
several
glasses
overall
this
beer
is
yet
another
outstanding
wild
ale
from
vinnie
and
russian
river
i
love
it
as
i
expected
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
do
not
hesitate
to
try
this
beer
growler
from
the
brewery
i
was
stoked
that
my
buddy
dane
brought
this
back
for
me
on
his
trip
home
from
san
francisco
damn
it
was
expensive
though
split
with
my
dad
poured
into
my
new
belgium
snifter
color
was
a
dark
red
with
some
purple
tint
minimal
bubbly
tannish
head
that
went
away
quickly
no
lacing
smell
was
black
currants
raspberries
cherries
brett
oak
mild
booze
toffee
sugar
and
tart
flavor
was
great
and
you
could
not
taste
the
ten
percent
at
all
starts
off
with
a
nice
sour
bite
soft
carbonation
allows
the
grapes
and
cherry
flavor
to
really
come
out
in
the
middle
musty
earthiness
in
the
finish
with
more
tart
like
how
this
one
feels
at
the
end
mellows
as
it
warms
but
nice
sugary
fruit
work
well
with
the
sourness
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rounded
thicker
body
for
a
sour
with
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
taste
lingers
very
well
easiest
drinking
ten
percent
beer
out
there
feel
free
to
argue
if
you
disagree
could
have
finished
the
jug
off
myself
not
heavy
on
the
stomach
somehow
refreshing
which
is
incredible
for
how
strong
it
is
those
red
wine
barrels
did
wonders
to
this
one
vinnie
does
not
brew
a
bad
sour
and
one
thing
is
for
sure
i
will
buying
numerous
bottles
when
this
stuff
is
finally
released
outside
of
the
pub
highly
recommended
pours
a
root
beer
color
with
almost
no
head
from
a
growler
the
small
head
that
is
there
quickly
dissipates
the
heavy
aroma
of
sourness
has
me
sniffing
for
a
tad
longer
than
usual
first
sip
is
a
puckering
sour
with
wild
yeast
notes
completely
in
charge
a
wine
flavor
slips
through
the
bitterness
even
with
a
somewhat
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
here
is
excellent
truly
an
amazing
beer
wow
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
its
superbly
well
balanced
and
extraordinarily
drinkable
for
the
abv
highly
recommended
wow
i
wish
i
could
get
a
lot
more
of
this
one
an
extremely
good
beer
overall
i
havent
reviewed
a
beer
in
awhile
but
this
one
warranted
a
formal
review
i
didnt
find
this
one
quite
as
good
as
beatification
one
of
my
top
3
beers
ever
but
its
not
far
behind
the
cabernet
barrel
aging
is
very
well
done
in
that
it
lends
complexity
and
character
to
the
beer
without
totally
overwhelming
all
other
flavors
itll
be
great
to
see
this
in
bottles
eventually
drinkability
right
up
there
with
all
the
other
wild
ales
vinnie
brews
one
of
my
new
favorites
winner
of
the
fest
imo
on
tap
russian
river
hot
damn
am
i
happy
to
see
this
on
the
chalkboard
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
small
beige
head
fading
to
a
thin
ring
before
long
and
swrved
in
a
snifter
big
oak
and
red
wine
nose
up
front
with
the
vinegar
and
sour
apple
notes
next
buttery
brett
and
leather
peak
out
stronger
as
i
nose
this
and
its
hard
to
pick
out
the
sweet
dark
fruit
that
is
salvation
in
the
base
beer
whoo
flavor
is
full
of
tons
of
sour
fruits
and
berries
with
a
definite
dry
red
wine
and
oak
finish
sour
factor
peaked
a
67and
i
wanted
to
add
there
was
some
low
earthy
bitterness
in
the
backend
as
well
im
hardpressed
to
find
any
salvation
in
this
full
body
with
light
prickly
carbonationjust
a
little
warming
in
the
belly
implies
the
10
really
effing
goodlooks
like
my
iowa
homies
are
getting
one
pricey
growler
wonderful
beer
and
wish
it
was
bottled
d
its
very
strong
for
a
sour
but
it
works
as
a
sipper
this
was
so
tasty
that
i
got
a
growler
despite
the
hefty
price
tag
vinnie
is
still
the
king
when
it
comes
to
sours
d
a
pretty
intense
but
delicious
beer
so
couldnt
have
too
many
my
favorite
sour
ale
as
of
yet
wouldve
got
a
growler
of
it
but
a
bit
too
spendy
i
havent
said
this
yet
but
this
beer
is
just
fantastic
it
has
an
incredible
balance
of
tartness
to
rich
fruit
and
light
though
structured
oak
character
the
flavor
is
just
so
well
integrated
everything
just
seems
to
work
together
to
carry
this
beer
up
to
another
level
of
complexity
and
interest
the
oak
really
does
add
lots
of
structure
which
goes
a
long
way
towards
helping
the
overall
balance
of
this
beer
i
like
that
the
incredibly
rich
fruit
character
never
gets
overwhelming
back
to
that
balance
again
this
is
an
awesome
beer
whose
enjoyment
i
am
sure
was
magnified
by
the
setting
as
well
as
the
prior
afternoon

the

abv
this
delicious
wild
ale
poured
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
pink
head
that
dissipates
immediately
the
nose
featured
aromas
of
tart
raspberries
and
white
wine
up
front
followed
by
undertones
of
oak
apricots
and
peach
the
mouth
was
very
tart
with
flavors
of
juicy
raspberries
chardonnay
oak
and
peach
that
blend
together
nicely
the
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
with
an
enamel
ripping
finish
that
was
quite
refreshing
this
was
a
solid
offering
from
russian
river
but
i
prefer
supplication
im
just
a
sucker
for
that
beer
and
beatification
over
this
one
98100
the
color
of
this
beer
was
beautiful
overall
this
is
a
very
well
done
fruited
sour
the
balance
between
the
fruit
flavor
and
the
sourness
is
almost
perfect
with
neither
flavor
ever
taking
over
the
other
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
russian
river
sour
and
i
really
miss
them
now
salty
o
good
but
not
quite
befitting
the
frenzy
happy
to
have
tried
it
happy
to
have
not
had
to
deal
with
the
craziness
at
russian
river
to
do
so
really
nice
framboise
the
sournesstartness
is
actually
pretty
well
balanced
by
the
raspberry
flavor
malt
is
barely
there
but
also
helps
to
balance
overall
its
sour
yet
smooth
and
refreshing
i
think
the
hype
has
made
this
beer
into
a
little
more
than
it
is
but
its
great
and
i
would
happily
have
this
whenever
given
this
chance
definitely
try
it
if
you
can
but
dont
trade
your
whole
cellar
away
for
it
always
delicious
had
it
on
tap
at
rrbc
and
got
a
few
bottles
obviously
i
think
i
like
it
a
little
better
than
last
years
batch
one
of
my
favorite
raspberry
beers
on
tap
at
the
brewery
light
and
refreshing
nice
raspberry
flavor
of
the
other
sours
probably
closest
in
mouthfeel
and
body
to
temptation
not
too
much
pucker
more
tart
than
sour
nice
on
a
hot
day
dthe
nose
is
fantastic
and
has
a
great
balanced
and
integration
of
juicy
fruits
and
nicely
done
funk
the
flavor
falls
slightly
short
of
that
in
that
the
fruits
are
more
mild
and
the
funk
is
slighly
muddled
still
reasonably
good
flavor
the
balance
is
there
it
just
seems
to
become
ever
so
slightly
messy
i
know
this
aint
the
most
detailed
review
but
i
enjoyed
the
11
1213
better
than
the
10
for
what
its
worth
i
hung
onto
the
10
since
the
release
and
really
wanted
a
5
year
tasting
but
popped
it
early
glad
i
did
seems
its
prime
was
a
while
ago
the
flavor
follows
with
a
pop
of
tart
berries
in
the
front
then
onto
again
that
wet
hay
funk
and
a
gentle
sweetness
of
stone
fruits
of
apricot
and
nectarine
a
nice
light
frothy
pink
on
the
surface
smells
of
raspberries
lemon
lactic
grass
and
some
more
raspberries
and
their
pithy
vegetal
character
this
beer
is
very
very
razzy
plenty
of
raspberry
notes
some
dry
tartness
lacto
tartness
some
gain
and
peppery
sharp
notes
its
tart
but
has
a
hollow
middle
for
me
medium
on
thin
bodied
with
moderate
on
hi
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
this
one
is
good
clean
and
approachable
o
easy
drinking
tasty
refreshing
and
a
good
level
of
sourness
a
solid
effort
overall
though
nothing
out
of
this
world
and
not
substantively
better
than
their
excellent
shelf
sours
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
which
as
i
have
admitted
before
may
not
be
all
that
long
honestly
but
thanks
to
drlovemd87
as
always
for
breaking
out
the
whales
pale
pink
in
color
like
raspberry
ginger
ale
and
possessing
the
same
sort
of
bright
carbonation
and
lightness
of
body
as
my
favorite
soda
white
head
is
wispy
but
quick
to
go
and
the
nose
is
a
wonderful
sensation
of
fresh
and
freeze
dried
raspberries
wild
yeast
tartness
lacto
and
lemon
there
is
an
herbal
softness
to
kick
this
off
before
the
berries
come
in
and
when
they
do
they
are
subtle
mellow
and
not
sweet
in
the
slightest
i
also
get
some
moderate
oak
more
woodsy
than
vanilla
i
suspect
a
real
light
char
if
any
beautiful
fruit
complexion
as
it
finishes
unfolding
like
a
blossoming
flower
and
has
that
same
delicacy
i
love
the
mouthfeel
too
soft
as
can
be
carbonated
like
a
soda
pop
and
drinking
like
anything
but
beer
just
light
and
effervescent
and
uplifting
in
every
way
not
as
raspberry
forward
as
i
sometimes
like
these
to
be
but
this
is
a
creation
unique
to
itself
unlike
the
others
and
so
i
dont
wish
it
to
be
any
different
another
beautiful
russian
river
brew
worthy
of
the
highest
trade
value
just
sensational
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
taste
though
was
a
big
time
drop
of
the
nose
if
this
was
agedold
i
could
understand
and
justify
it
but
for
a
fresh
wild
the
raspberry
should
be
much
more
powerful
would
definitely
have
it
again
though
overall
the
aroma
builds
anticipation
that
doesnt
fulfill
in
the
flavor
but
the
base
beer
is
too
good
for
this
to
be
anything
but
tasty
temptation
is
subdued
but
holds
this
on
its
shoulders
o
a
very
good
take
on
a
framboise
i
would
put
this
one
behind
framboos
and
hommage
but
better
than
lp
framboise
the
beer
pours
a
dull
blood
orangepink
with
a
thin
foamy
white
head
and
touch
of
sediment
the
nose
is
subtle
tart
raspberry
with
deep
funk
and
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
definitely
tart
raspberries
in
the
forefront
with
an
acidic
funkiness
that
really
ramps
up
the
fruits
juiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
but
not
watery
effervescent
tartacidic
and
definitely
drinkable
this
is
a
lighter
bodied
subtle
raspberry
framb
with
a
big
funk
presence
and
balanced
acidity
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
pours
a
hazy
light
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
raspberry
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
and
tart
raspberry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
slightly
better
sour
raspberry
quality
in
the
aroma
a
little
candylike
not
the
most
complex
sour
theyve
brewed
but
this
would
make
a
great
intro
to
the
style
of
course
you
have
to
get
your
hands
on
it
o
really
good
stuff
not
as
complex
as
russian
rivers
other
sours
but
still
incredibly
refreshing
and
tasty
o
this
is
a
delicious
beer
i
know
ive
never
had
a
framboise
i
enjoyed
more
and
am
fairly
certain
ive
never
had
a
sour
i
enjoyed
more
if
this
beer
were
easier
to
get
and
more
consistently
available
id
consume
it
regularly
and
be
thrilled
about
it
as
it
is
its
just
a
great
treat
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
in
the
area
during
their
october
release
of
this
beer
and
im
so
glad
i
was
i
love
all
of
russian
rivers
sour
ales
but
this
one
was
unique
not
quite
as
sour
as
some
of
their
others
but
it
made
it
so
drinkable
that
it
was
addictive
definitely
a
strong
dose
of
raspberries
they
put
100
pounds
of
raspberries
in
per
barrel
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
with
a
touch
of
bread
the
mouthfeel
was
incredible
i
couldve
chugged
beer
after
beer
if
i
wanted
to
moderate
sour
and
sweet
crisp
finish
i
wasnt
able
to
get
any
bottles
but
i
definitely
drank
my
fill
on
draft
excellent
beer
highly
recommend
of
youre
in
the
area
during
the
month
long
release
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
if
the
opportunity
to
get
this
again
comes
up
its
just
as
high
priority
as
beat
is
its
just
a
nice
wellbalanced
and
sweet
american
sour
that
hits
the
spot
that
some
of
the
belgians
dont
read
less
funky
more
sweet
its
a
great
beer
for
sure
o
so
very
good
what
a
treat
vinnie
does
it
again
o
really
tart
beer
with
a
good
raspberry
presence
wished
they
made
it
more
often
and
definitely
love
that
they
are
doing
this
for
a
cause
o
this
beer
is
very
well
blended
and
provides
interesting
complexities
from
the
sourness
and
raspberries
its
not
too
sour
and
the
fruity
flavors
seem
very
natural
o
easy
to
drink
and
really
well
balanced
between
the
upfront
sweetness
and
tartnesssourness
very
enjoyable
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
framboise
beers
no
hints
of
anything
artificial
very
much
the
natural
flavors
of
the
fruits
o
this
was
a
great
framboise
and
probably
my
second
favorite
ive
had
next
to
cantillons
lou
pepe
framboise
which
add
a
little
bit
more
funkiness
that
only
cantillon
can
achieve
it
was
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
sweet
fruit
presence
balanced
with
a
nice
tartness
if
you
like
the
style
of
framboise
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
out
framboise
for
a
cure
is
damn
good
as
i
stated
earlier
im
a
huge
fan
of
raspberries
and
i
tend
to
be
somewhat
biased
towards
beers
with
wellintegrated
raspberries
exactly
what
this
beer
is
that
being
said
and
somewhat
shockingly
so
i
think
i
prefer
the
regular
temptation
to
this
batch
of
framboise
for
a
cure
which
is
essentially
temptation
with
raspberries
nevertheless
still
a
fine
brew
and
sure
to
make
any
raspberry
andor
sour
lover
go
nuts
get
some
o
a
great
beer
for
a
great
cause

this
poured
out
as
a
beautiful
red
color
with
a
light
pink
head
on
top
the
retention
is
pretty
good
here
not
much
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
slightly
floral
and
fruity
with
a
tart
aroma
on
it
the
taste
is
tart
with
a
nice
raspberry
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
sweet
and
dry
plenty
of

notes
overall
this
is
a
really
good
brew
glad
i
got
to
have
it
cost

for
a
375
ml
bottle
overall
framboise
for
a
cure
is
a
great
fruit
sour
however
it
needs
a
little
more
complexity
from
the
base
beer
in
order
to
compete
with
the
likes
of
lou
pepe
framboise
or
southampton
black
raspberry
lambic
tart
and
puckering
with
a
nice
balance
of
musty
funk
sweet
beery
and
earthy
oak
theres
a
subtle
lactic
presence
in
finish
that
compliments
the
barrel
fruit
and
sour
notes
not
acidic
or
harsh
with
the
perfect
amount
of
sourness
that
counters
the
oak
barrel
and
seedy
berries
sweet
vinous
raspberries
flavor
is
strong
but
not
as
prominent
as
it
is
in
the
nose
very
juicy
and
fresh
with
lots
of
raspberry
currant
grape
and
other
dark
fruits
very
complex
yet
remains
delicate
and
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
sour
delicious
o
very
well
done
fruit
sour
top
of
the
charts
for
an
american
wild
thanks
to
deeblo
for
the
chance
to
snag
a
bottle
of
this
o
tart
and
sweet
then
tart
again
very
tasty
o
very
very
tasty
not
my
favorite
rr
sour
but
im
very
impressed
would
drink
this
anytime
its
available
overall
recomended
you
try
this
if
you
like
raspberry
sour
ales
its
gotta
be
at
the
top
of
its
class
russian
river
does
a
fantastic
job
on
this
beer
overall
a
fine
sour
with
some
great
fruit
flavours
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
could
verdict
just
delightful
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
another
world
class
sour
beer
from
russian
river
the
raspberry
flavors
are
really
allowed
to
shine
here
and
with
it
bring
out
some
great
complimentary
aspects
that
take
this
to
a
new
level
rather
than
just
being
a
sour
bomb
glad
to
have
another
one
to
cellar
o
this
elusive
beer
has
been
in
my
gots
list
since
the
first
batch
and
it
did
not
disappoint
solid
beer
all
around
and
glad
to
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
good
lookin
out
beezler
this
thing
pours
pink
pink
pink
a
nice
light
frothy
pink
on
the
surface
smells
of
raspberries
lemon
lactic
grass
and
some
more
raspberries
and
their
pithy

character
this
beer
is
very
very
razzy
plenty
of
raspberry
notes
some
dry
tartness
lacto
tartness
some

and
peppery
sharp
notes
its

but
has
a
hollow
middle
for
me
medium
on
thin
bodied
with
moderate
on
hi
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
this
one
is
good
clean
and
approachable
taste
is
similar
mostly
dry
raspberry
with
faint
sweetness
lightly
sour
and
tart
and
acidic
a
light
but
firm
rustic
yeastiness
underneath
and
light
yeasty
bread
in
the
aftertaste
it
has
some
noticeable
rusticfunky
yeasty
and
sourale
character
but
it
certainly
could
use
more
to
make
a
really
complex
fruit
wild
ale
however
it
is
very
good
crisp
bright
quenching
and
has
a
little
complexity
but
not
nearly
enough
to
be
a
truly
exceptional
example
i
like
beers
of
this
sort
to
have
a
lot
of
flavour
not
be
really
lean
and
dry
like
dry
champagne
which
this
tends
towards
i
also
like
my
fruit
wild
ales
or
lambics
to
have
plenty
of
very
evident
funkyyeasty
character
in
addition
to
the
fruit
the
feel
is
pretty
good
but
a
bit
thin
and
not
lively
or
engaging
owhat
a
beer
russian
river
knows
what
they
are
doing
with
their
sour
program
feel
is
a
nice
step
below
medium
with
a
great
pucker
on
the
end
of
the
tounge
swirling
this
around
the
mouth
keeps
the
berries
coming
very
fresh
beer
here
i
wonder
what
time
would
do
to
this
but
i
would
have
a
hard
time
holding
it
i
ordered
another
glass
on
the
way
out
pours
distinct
raspberry
red
color
with
a
finger
of
light
pink
foam
the
head
fell
somewhat
quickly
and
left
nothing
behind
the
nose
is
full
of
tart
raspberries
and
a
mild
sugary
sweetness
some
musty
hay
and
acidic
cider
vinegar
on
the
palate
the
raspberries
are
front
and
center
big
bold
tart
raspberries
rush
the
palate
with
a
mild
sugary
sweetness
in
tow
some
hay
and
light
manurelike
funk
come
through
in
the
middle
before
tart
raspberries
pop
back
up
in
the
finish
the
finish
is
sharp
dry
and
tart
light
body
with
high
carbonation
the
raspberry
flavor
really
lingers
your
mouth
is
coated
with
fresh
raspberries
a
really
delicious
beer
with
loads
of
fresh
fruit
extremely
drinkable
served
in
a
tulip
glass
poured
a
bright
magenta
color
with
a
small
frothy
white
head
that
fizzled
out
after
a
moment
leaving
a
ringlet
and
a
few
stray
bubbles
behind
lots
of
raspberry
in
the
nose
as
would
be
expected
lesser
notes
of
musty
grass
and
citrus
juice
puckeringly
tart
on
the
tongue
fresh
raspberries
dominate
citric
lactic
acetic
just
a
bit
mild
grassy
funk
and
a
touch
of
woodiness
tasty
good
balance
of
sour
and
sweet
once
your
palate
gets
used
to
the
initial
snap
of
tartness
lightmedium
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
if
you
like
soursfruitslambics
drink
cant
thank
jim
enough
for
helping
me
tick
this
one
good
sour
and
an
even
better
cause
this
years
vintage
of
framboise
for
a
cure
was
blended
80
to
20
with
russian
rivers
spontaneously
fermented
sour
beatification
the
hint
of
the
lambic
or
sonambic
as
russian
river
calls
beatification
really
adds
a
layer
of
nuanced
funkiness
that
really
sets
it
apart
from
the
previous
two
vintages
which
utilized
purely
their
blonde
sour
temptation
as
the
base
beer
while
not
russian
rivers
most
complex
of
their
sours
the
2013
framboise
for
a
cure
really
harnesses
the
raw
essence
of
fresh
raspberries
like
no
other
beer
ive
had
highly
recommended
o
this
beer
was
awesome
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
as
it
progresses
tasty
beer
but
needs
more
raspberries
to
be
a
worldclass
framboise
the
souracid
level
on
this
beer
is
right
at
the
threshold
or
perhaps
a
bit
overdone
as
the
throat
burn
lingers
with
a
good
length
375ml
of
the
second
batch
temptation
base
bright
red
almost
fuschia
color
pink
head
that
disappeared
quick
looks
like
a
kriek
the
smell
was
funky
sort
of
fecal
like
manure
a
hint
of
fruit
flavor
was
sour
acidic
sharp
fruit
but
not
a
distinct
raspberry
flavor
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
russian
rivers
best
id
like
to
have
tried
the
beatification
version
so
hopefully
that
make
that
again
this
beer
pours
the
brightest
cherry
red
in
color
a
little
light
in
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
only
a
slight
pinkish
head
it
is
bright
bright
red
the
nose
is
sour
and
has
great
acidity
it
features
a
nice
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
raspberry
with
just
enough
fruit
there
really
isnt
too
much
yeast
character
at
all
it
drinks
almost
an
off
dry
due
to
the
presence
of
juicy
raspberry
it
is
just
fantastic
this
is
such
a
great
and
easy
drinking
raspberry
sour
i
place
it
at
the
very
top
above
lp
framboise
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
o
a
fantastic
sour
and
one
which
i
would
love
the
chance
to
try
again
a
musttry
for
sour
fans
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
find
it
and
have
the
cash
anyways
this
has
a
mellow
and
nice
funky
thing
going
on
but
the
raspberries
really
take
a
hold
of
this
and
throw
a
lot
of
natural
flavor
in
as
well
it
leans
towards
too
fruity
a
bit
but
doesnt
get
overly
obnoxious
so
much
that
were
entering
artificial
lambic
territory
a
la
lindemans
a
treat
to
be
able
to
try
and
im
glad
i
didnt
make
the
trek
all
the
way
to
santa
rosa
and
was
able
to
try
it
at
city
beer
instead
mouthfeel
is
puckering
but
doesnt
destroy
your
mouth
with
acidity
sweetness
keeps
it
incredibly
drinkable
seed
aspect
is
incredible
on
all
levels
overall
there
are
not
too
many
other
sours
ive
had
that
can
measure
up
to
this
one
well
this
is
a
nice
if
not
a
bit
simple
a
slightly
sour
raspberry
delivery
vehicle
that
serves
a
singular
purpose
drinkable
if
not
a
bit
one
dimentional
big
thanks
to
kevsal
for
the
hookup
pours
a
ruby
red
with
a
nice
head
nose
is
blanketed
with
funky
barnyard
aroma
with
some
citrus
and
raspberry
taste
starts
off
with
a
burst
of
raspberry
citrus
flavor
this
moves
to
a
funky
must
and
mushroom
ends
nicely
with
some
citrus
sourness
and
a
lot
of
raspberry
overall
this
is
pretty
awesome
framboise
i
like
the
funkiness
and
the
sweetness
recommended
if
you
can
snag
a
bottle
d
very
drinkable
really
great
tartness
from
the
raspberries
on
top
of
the
temptation
base
the
extra
flavor
adds
some
great
complexity
and
sharpness
to
the
beer
nice
one
russian
river
keep
fighting
that
fight
all
in
the
name
of
boobies
hooray
for
boobies
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
awesome
beer
i
had
heard
batch
2
wasnt
that
good
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
when
i
finally
opened
it
ton
of
sour
dark
fruits
in
the
nose
a
beer
ill
certainly
try
and
get
when
they
brew
it
again
worth
seeking
out
this
framboise
is
all
about
what
makes
the
raspberry
fruit
shine
and
what
complements
it
in
what
intensity
the
riddle
is
answered
with
this
well
controlled
taste
in
one
of
the
best
ales
of
its
style
o
pretty
bummed
about
this
beer
least
the
20
went
to
the
hospital
down
the
street
dunno
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
overall
this
beer
was
a
huge
let
down
after
the
3
fonteinen
hommage
it
is
like
comparing
fishsticks
with
freshly
prepared
codfish
comparing
the
wageningen
ice
tigers
with
the
boston
bruins
it
just
doesnt
make
any
sense
it
is
a
completely
different
league
if
one
is
unaware
of
the
greatness
that
is
out
there
one
probably
thinks
this
beer
is
worldclass
however
in
a
showdown
with
the
better
ones
this
framboise
for
a
cure
is
downgraded
to
the
fishstick
and
wageningen
ice
tiger
level
the
hommage
simply
did
to
this
beer
what
the
atomic
bomb
did
to
nagasaki
it
completely
wiped
it
off
the
beermap
the
only
thing
that
has
to
be
cured
now
is
my
faith
in
usraspberry
sours
overall
wish
i
could
say
i
was
more
impressed
with
this
than
i
was
we
had
this
right
after
hommage
that
probably
didnt
help
this
simply
looked
and
tasted
artificial
as
if
something
unnatural
was
added
to
get
the
color
and
flavor
they
wanted
the
nose
was
simply
too
mild
and
boring
to
be
worth
noting
as
well
another
member
of
our
group
that
day
thought
this
was
the
best
sour
of
the
day
so
take
my
review
for
what
its
worth
i
found
this
to
be
a
big
disappointment
especially
after
having
hommage
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
temptation
is
one
of
my
favorite
wilds
from
russian
river
and
it
worked
very
well
as
the
base
for
this
beer
awesome
stuff
for
sure
o
good
american
framboise
but
is
not
in
the
league
of
some
of
my
favorites
from
belgum
o4
thanks
for
sharing
this
375
ml
tom
well
very
pink
bodied
for
starters
a
great
aroma
of
fruit
dessert
the
taste
came
off
quite
well
with
sourness
and
fruitiness
i
could
have
easily
have
finished
it
myself
if
someone
had
not
kept
grabbing
the
bottle
certainly
worthy
of
rr
good
mouthfeel
for
a
sour
beer
pours
an
awesomelooking
brilliant
ruby
red
with
very
little
head
smell
is
equally
excellent
great
mix
of
raspberries
and
the
typical
russian
river
souroak
aroma
flavor
has
a
little
bit
of
funk
up
front
before
the
raspberries
take
over
then
it
finishes
a
bit
tart
and
acidic
its
mediumbodied
and
a
little
dry
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
raspberry
sour
one
of
the
best
ive
had
my
past
experiences
with
raspberries
havent
been
super
positive
and
this
one
definitely
stands
out
above
the
pack
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
definitely
worthy
of
some
trades
o
this
is
pretty
much
everything
i
was
hoping
ffac
would
be
and
more
i
think
this
is
now
my
favorite
rr
beer
and
quite
possibly
a
very
close
2nd
to
rose
de
gambrinus
very
pleased
with
this
very
good
beer
and
one
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
if
you
havent
tried
this
and
like
sours
andor
fruit
beers
and
like
supporting
good
causes
get
this
beer
i
could
seriously
put
a
dent
into
a
keg
of
this
if
not
finish
it
off
within
an
almost
medically
unsound
timeframe
this
is
a
sour
bomb
its
mouth
puckeringly
delicious
fresh
raspberries
dominate
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
finish
is
very
dry
and
sharp
o
i
never
thought
i
would
get
to
try
this
stuff
id
say
this
is
the
best
american
framboise
ive
had
to
date
rr
really
kills
some
sours
the
temptation
base
is
awesome
as
always
and
the
fruit
is
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
o
really
impressed
with
this
beer
i
had
high
hopes
and
was
not
let
down
love
the
sour
tartness
that
comes
out
i
also
love
fresh
raspberries
which
came
out
upfront
in
this
beer
extremely
grateful
to
have
traded
for
this
gem
and
would
love
another
opportunity
to
try
it
with
some
age
really
wish
they
put
the
back
label
on
this
guy
to
show
what
they
feel
the
aging
should
be
like
and
how
exactly
this
one
was
made
the
20
price
tag
is
also
a
bit
steep
for
the
beer
your
getting
but
it
is
for
a
good
cause
i
gotta
say
its
going
to
be
tough
for
any
new
beer
i
try
in
2012
to
top
this
one
bottle
shared
at
the
december
iteration
of
the
santa
cruz
tasting
series
pours
a
vivid
magenta
color
without
much
of
a
head
absurd
raspberry
aroma
fruitier
and
more
tart
than
even
ng
raspberry
tart
really
the
most
realistic
eyepopping
recreation
of
fruit
in
a
beer
that
ive
ever
smelled
great
balance
in
the
flavor
between
sourness
and
fruit
divine
dark
purple
raspberry
hue
pink

smells
of
full
on
fresh

puree
touch
of
tart
funk
with
a
good

flavors
are
pretty
much
raspberry
city
the
tartness
is
mild

the
finish
medium

a
true
delight
to
drink
for

very
glad
i

to
try
it

the
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
hue
unsurprisingly
resembling
raspberry
juice
the
head
is
pinky
and
foamy
rapidly
receding
to
zilch
the
aroma
brings
some
distinctive
russian
river
yeast
with
a
bold
serving
of
raspberries
great
flavor
with
lots
of
fresh
slightly
tart
berries
pretty
straightforward
not
overly
funky
sour
or
tart

rather
refreshing
chuggable
and
delicious
light
on
the
palate
with
spritzy
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
an
excellent
beer
pours

color
with
a
dense

head
nice
retention
complex
aroma
of
tart
raspberry
earth
funk
and
oak
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
raspberry
lactic
and
earthy
must
not
particularly
sour
or
as
interesting
as
temptation
but
not
good
nonetheless
light
crisp
mild
bite
on
the
body
i
like
raspberries
so
i
liked
this
a
lot
but
fresh
the
depth
of
other
rr
sours
is
lacking
from
this
batch
framboise
for
a
cure
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
cherry
red
there
are
plentiful
gorgeous
ruby
highlights
shining
through
even
when
the
beers
not
backlit
about
a
finger
of
rose
tinted
foam
briefly
graces
the
top
of
the
glass
before
quickly
fading
away
the
nose
is
nearly
flawless
raspberry
is
the
first
thing
to
jump
out
and
is
the
dominant
aroma
present
earthy
brett
funk
is
right
behind
playing
a
strong
second
an
acetic
sour
twang
is
also
there
but
very
much
in
the
background
compared
to
the
other
two
my
only
minor
quibble
is
that
the
whole
thing
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
powerful
the
first
thing
that
stands
out
about
the
flavor
is
that
its
much
more
tart
than
the
nose
would
have
suggested
a
close
second
is
that
the
raspberries
have
fallen
way
off
from
what
i
expected
if
the
aroma
profile
was
504010
in
terms
of
raspberryfunksour
id
say
the
taste
is
at
203050
with
the
berry
flavor
only
creeping
in
on
the
back
end
the
body
is
fairly
dry
and
works
nicely
with
the
expansive
champagnelike
carbonation
framboise
for
a
cure
is
another
world
class
wild
brew
from
russian
river
though
im
surprised
both
at
how
just
how
wild
it
is
and
how
muted
the
fruit
is
for
a
relatively
young
beer
flavor
largely
matches
the
aroma
with
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
from
the
raspberries
but
still
not
as
tart
as
i
had
anticipated
from
a
russian
river
sour
biscuity
malts
in
the
background
dryness
is
onpoint
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
level
really
suits
the
drinkability
enjoyed
every
sip
of
the
bottle
without
getting
fatigued
like
other
sours
have
the
capability
of
doing
a
nice
framboise
in
the
end
but
slightly
underwhelming
given
the
attention
paid
to
this
sour
i
think
framboise
for
a
cure
is
a
wellapplied
use
of
raspberry
and
barrel
aside
from
the
finish
in
any
case
i
am
quite
happy
to
have
tried
it

aroma
of

oak
and
funk
taste
follows
the
nose
with
raspberries
up

then
sour
notes
and
funk
then
oak
while
finishing
back
with
the
raspberries
tart
but
not
crazy
which
makes
this
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
my
favorite
framboise
to
date
do
drinkability
is
high
during
a
night
which
we
had
a
good
amount
of
sours
this
one
stands
alone
as
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
night
it
doesnt
rely
on
the
oak
barrel
to
provide
the
flavor
even
though
it
was
present
and
the
tartness
is
just
prominent
enough
to
deliver
the
strong
raspberry
flavors
but
keep
it
balanced
and
enjoyable
one
of
the
best
russian
river
beers
ive
had
and
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
period
o
best
sour
of
the
night
including
the
goose
island
3
sisters
and
bruery
oude
tart
one
of
the
best
american
wilds
i
have
ever
had
the
privilege
of
tasting
taste
jeez
this
just
doesnt
let
up
incredibly
flavorful
rich
raspberries
seemingly
picked
at
the
height
of
sweet
and
tenderness
somehow
neither
the
immense
fruitness
or
sourness
envelope
each
other
russian
river
really
outdid
themselves
on
this
one
o
very
good
framboise
as
much
as
i
enjoy
the
sweeter
and
fruitier
framboises
out
there
ng
raspberry
tart
blushing
monk
etc
i
have
to
say
this
was
just
about
as
enjoyable
but
in
a
different
way
refreshing
tartness
with
fresh
raspberries
mixed
in
and
still
retaining
the
wild
characteristics
interesting
and
having
some
added
complexity
no
letdown
here
at
all
glad
to
have
gotten
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
best
american
framboise
i
have
had
never
overpowering
and
well
integrated
through
out
no
sign
that
temptation
is
the
base
for
this
cheers
russian
river
beer
is
light
airy
on
the
palate
mildly
sweet
acetic
bite
strong
raspberry
overall
a
nice
little
beer
id
have
it
again
o
best
sour
ive
had
to
date
just
absolutely
incredible
the
sour
was
pungent
but
didnt
detract
from
the
fruit
flavors
one
bit
not
quite
as
sour
as
cuvee
de
jacobins
but
close
officially
an
always
want
of
mine
excellent
and
i
would
not
expect
anything
else
from
russian
river
perfectly
bubbly
and
champagne
like
i
love
it
o
very
refreshing
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
really
really
good
wish
it
was
in
a
bigger
bottle
brashly
fruity
and
tart
with
a
good
funk
an
awesome
example
of
an
authentic
framboise
by
russian
river
glad
it
became
more
available
this
year
so
more
people
can
taste
it
even
if
the
base
beer
isnt
the
same
last
year
beatification
this
year
its
temptation
trade
for
this
if
you
can
it
will
not
disappoint
very
impressive
beer
though
at
least
for
me
this
isnt
the
sort
of
thing
id
want
to
drink
every
day
still
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
overall
this
is
a
treat
to
drink
plenty
of
fresh
raspberry
fruitiness
intertwined
with
a
lemon
rind
sourness
and
barnyardwet
blanket
funk
complex
layered
yet
balanced
and
drinkable
overall
this
was
pretty
good
though
i
think
beatification
would
certainly
make
a
better
base
that
said
id
love
to
try
the
first
batch
fresh
raspberry
dessert
sour
drinks
very
easily
and
each
sip
brings
complex
deliciousness
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
prickly
and
lively
level
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
visually
it
looks
to
be
a
bit
lacking
even
though
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
brew
it
carries
with
it
some
very
familiar
aspects
to
it
it
was
quite
enjoyable
and
the
alcohol
level
is
well
integrated
throughout
an
interesting
brew
that
is
worth
the
try
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
not
fully
worth
the
price
tag
of
admission
but
for
the
cause
it
is
well
worth
it
and
something
i
would
see
out
again
just
because
overall
another
impressive
russian
river
sour
however
im
left
feeling
a
bit
dissapointed
im
not
sure
this
is
any
better
than
temptation
which
is
a
shame
given
the
rarity
and
increased
price
overall
i
am
normally
a
huge
fan
of
raspberry
sours
but
i
felt
the
raspberry
flavors
blocked
out
the
other
nice
complexities
in
the
base
beer
resulting
a
slightly
lower
score
overall
well
done
sour
good
fruit
flavor
well
balanced

drinkability
is
very
high
if
you
can
afford
it
thank
god
its
goin

boobies
overall
this
beer
was
like
the
bruerys
berazzled
on
steroids
a
better
version
of
it
one
of
the
best
framboise
style
beers
ive
ever
had
awesome
beer
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
and
barnyard
very
well
done
overall
a
very
nice
raspberry
wild
ale
a
bottle
or
two
could
be
finished
easily
in
a
sitting
if
one
had
money
to
burn
perfect
candidate
for
pairing
with
cheeses
and
charcuterie
a
unique
beer
from
a
great
brewery
for
a
great
cause
love
that
they
have
throttled
the
release
this
year
so
that
geeks
like
me
get
a
shot
at
buying
it
o
this
aroma
of
this
beer
is
amazing
it
is
like
diving
into
a
basket
of
fresh
raspberries
i
was
really
surprised
at
how
mouth
puckering
this
beer
was
but
it
added
that
feel
of
eating
a
tart
raspberry
this
beer
was
quite
amazing
and
is
probably
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
had
so
far
o
good
but
not
great
would
strongly
prefer
a
funky

good
things
about
this

a

wonderful
addition
that
i
really
wish
i
could
try
more
of
this
was
just
amazing
overall
this
brew
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
wish
the
fruit
were
a
little
fresher
because
it
just
doesnt
hold
up
as
well
as
i
expected
its
almost
more
about
the
citrus
acidity
at
this
point
still
a

pleasure
i
look

to
trying
this
again
someday

d
very
easy
to
drink
and
tasting
i
think
the
rarity
and
fact
it
is
rr
bumps
it
up
just
slightly
in
a
lot
of
reviews
but
this
is
a
great
beer
id
love
to
drink
again
drinkability
is
great
good
balance
nice
depth
this
one
perhaps
suffers
from
being
consumed
right
after
the
stellar
framboos
so
im
trying
not
to
hold
that
against
it
i
like
the
brighter
aspect
that
it
brings
d
super
stupid
easy
to
drink
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
try
a
cantillon
lou
pepe
framboise
early
last
year
and
although
i
didnt
rate
it
i
remember
it
fondly
while
this
was
very
good
i
dont
think
it
quite
compared
to
the
cantillon
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
more
of
this
stuff
brewed
in
the
future
and
potentially
making
its
way
up
here
for
sale
at
the
bottle
shops
in
portland
i
would
definitely
buy
up
some
of
those
bottles

loved
it
pity
its
so
rare
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
d
im
really
thankful
to
have
gotten
the
chance
to
have
this
one
as
there
was
a
bit
of
craziness
when
it
first
debuted
i
have
to
say
though
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
an
amazing
creation
by
vinny
and
his
team
worth
the
trouble
to
seek
out
d
quite
a
bit
different
from
batch
one
with
far
more
fruit
and
less
wild
character
i
think
i
liked
batch
1
a
tiny
bit
more
but
still
a
quality
brew
d
so
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
not
mindblowing
but
then
again
its
solid
enough
to
be
enjoyed
for
exactly
what
its
advertised
to
be

some
light
manure
and
citrus
fruits
light
raspberry
very
nice
fresh
bright
on
the
nose
mouth
is
at
first
very
sour
its
all
about
the
base
beer
here
beatification
and
not
much
about
the
berries
in
fact
the
berries
act
mostly
to
muddle
and
confuse
the
beatification
a
fair
amount
of
lemon
in
the
mouth
some
salt
edges
in
the
fruit
just
struggles
with
the
sharp
sourness
of
the
base
beer
which
lends
to
a
lack
of
balance
in
the
flavor
profile
awesome
nose
awesome
base
beer
but
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
looking
forward
to
future
batches
as
i
think
vinnie
will
hone
it
in
overall
this
was
a
great
sour
from
rr
the
raspberries
used
very
excellent
and
it
was
very
drinkable
it
was
definitely
a
treat
to
have
sour
tart
and
fruity
awesome
stuff
thanks
kevin
for
sharing

to

this

me

vibrant
reddish

color
with
a
with
fluffy
head
some
yeast
sediment
floating
around
did
someone
say
raspberries
were
in
this
the
aroma
is
strong
tart
raspberry
with
some
underlying
brett
like
florals
light
mouthfeel
holy
tartness
batman
the
raspberry
tartness
takes
center
stage
on
this
with
some
additional
notes
of
barrel
and
floral
highly
carbonated
but
surprisingly
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
flavor
of
the
beer
this
is
such
a
nice
drinking
beer
clean
and
crisp
with
strong
fruit
and
sour
qualities
an
excellent
beer
definitely
an
experience
that
i
am
glad
i
shared
with
petesuphi
cmurren25
jwiss22
and
therealnomayo
i
think
the
ca
bas
are
too
critical
of
some
of
the
ridiculous
beers
that
have
been
produced
in
their
state
this
is
just
another
sign
to
me
that
russian
river
is
frozen
in
time
from
about
5
years
ago
or
perhaps
on
the
decline
while
rr
certainly
blazed
the
trail
many
us
brewers
cisco
allagash
ithica
lost
abbey
cascade
upland
are
in
the
process
of
leaving
or
have
left
russian
river
behind
this
beer
was
a
bit
more
hype
than
i
care
for
but
the
cause
is
definitely
worth
it
d
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
liked
the
bottle
of
beatification
i
had
better
but
this
is
one
of
rrs
better
sours
and
a
fantastic
beer
all
around
that
should
get
better
with
a
little
age
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
you
have
the
ammo
dits
really
really
tasty
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
this
exceeded
my
expectations
another
truly
great
sour
from
rrbc
overall
reminiscent
of
a
drier
funkier
lost
abbey
framboise
de
amorosa
a
complex
and
delicious
american
sour
fruit
beer
d
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
as
you
would
expect
from
a
russian

wild
ale
im
glad
theyll
be
making
this
again
as
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
next

ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
a

more
bottles
since
my

i
like
it
more
and
more
each
time
i
dont
know
if
its
just
developing
well
or
if
bottles
vary

my
impression
rises
steadily

this
is

made

hopefully

makes
it
here
at

i
am
impressed
that

still
easily
recognizable
as
a
beer
while
it
features
very
thoughtful
and
effectively
integrated
sparkling
wine
constituents
malts

hops
play
an
important
role
as
they
prevent
the
beer
from
becoming

fizzy

subtle
musty
and
earthy
additions
do
the
same
convincing
me
this
is
still
beer
finishes
quite
refreshing
with
a
faint
lemon
fruitiness

an
almost

just

how
can
i
get

the

sours
very
light

crisp

is
both
refreshing

delishious

first
sip
reveals
a
great
sour
and
tart
citrusy
goodness
a
nice
farmhouse
yeast
character
comes
through
with
great
earthy
funk
not
quite
as
fruity
as
the
aroma
was
but
the
chardonnay
doesnt
go
unnoticed
overall
a
great
blend
of
wood
yeast
and
sourness
thats
served
well
by
the
excellent
blonde
ale
at
its
base
overall
a
delicious
complex
sour
with
nice
carbonation
very
refreshing
overall
a
crisp

wow
this
is
not
what
i
consider
beer
like
a
super
strong
white

or
something
at

a

its

to
see
if
my
palate
has
changed
o
russian
river
never
disappoints
very
clean
and
well
blended
tart
and
fruity
with
some
dryness
from
the
barrel
a
very
tart
yet
well
balanced
sour
one
of
my
favorites
from
russian
river
o
probably
the
bestbalanced
wildsour
ale
ive
ever
had
it
has
a
wineness
thats
pleasant
at
first
then
a
great
lightcitrusy
beer
finishes
you
off
with
a
fizz
its
very
fresh
tartness
is
balanced
very
well
and
the
whole
beer
in
the
glass
is
a
topnotch
experience
from
pouring
to
tasting
oenjoyable
beer
have
had
this
cellaring
for
a
couple
months
now
and
decided
to
take
it
out
wish
i
had
another
one
or
two
of
these
in
my
cellar
so
i
could
age
them
and
see
how
they
progress
and
change
overtime
lovely
sour
beer
and
cannot
wait
to
have
this
one
again
high
price
where
i
got
it20
for
the
375ml
but
happy
with
the
purchase
o
a
well
balanced
wild
ale
like
im
diving
into
a
glass
of
wine
for
a
split
second
then
quickly
into
sour
tart
and
fruity
goodness
i
prefer
a
couple
of
the
other
rr
sours
but
would
never
turn
this
one
away
poured
into
a
riedel
vinum
pinot
noir
glass
it
showed
a
sudsy
soapy
head
and
a
brilliant
lemongold
color
smelled
incredibly
fresh
and
tangy
with
citrus
and
hints
of
vanilla
the
flavor
was
really
good
but
was
a
bit
onedimensional
im
thinking
of
it
compared
to
a
pliny
the
elder
that
was
consumed
last
night
nice
acidity
hoppiness
and
vibrancy
on
the
palate
with
a
clean
aftertaste
good
stuff
and
i
need
to
find
some
more
o
another
very
good
ation
for
rr
i
have
tried
supplication
and
concecration
also
in
order
i
prefer
supp
then
conc
then
temp
so
its
my
least
favorite
of
the
ations
that
ive
had
but
its
still
a
great
beer
im
really
splitting
hairs
it
mostly
depends
on
what
flavor
profile
you
are
in
the
mood
for
as
those
3
are
all
fairly
different
so
its
not
an
entirely
fair
comparison

id
probably
need

other
less
accomplished
sours
to

how
well
this
is
done
but
id
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
o
not
bad
i
am
not
a
huge
wine
fan
especially
chardonnay
so
i
am
biased
unfortunately
definitely
adds
some
nice
complexity
at
least
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
ever
had
hazed
bright
golden
blonde
ring
of
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
smell
is
earthy
with
oak
oak

a
great
deal

lemony

as
well
as
white

even
more
funky
as
it

tatse
is
initially
a
sharp
acidity
and
quite
sour
earthy

a

sour

lemon
white

and
incredibly
dry

puckering
aftertaste
dry
medium

medium

really
good
stuff
great
mix
of
sour
white
ine
oak
and
fruit
here
would
love
to
aquire
a
couple
bottles
of
this
o
absolutely
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
best
feels
to
a
beer
i
have
ever
tried
the
sourtart
fruit
flavor
is
outstanding
yet
again
rr
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
definitely
get
this
beer
pours
hazy
golden
yellow
with
light
white
head
aroma
of
lemon
and
light
oak
and
funky
smell
taste
of
nice
belgian
malt
with
sour
grapes
and
great
carbonation
up
front
on
the
backend
of
the
sip
i
get
an
oak
and
funky
bret
taste
the
beer
isnt
too
acidic
but
leaves
a
marvelous
citrusgrape
refreshing
aftertaste
some
sweetness
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
all
this
i
completely
understand
the
incredibly
high
scores
for
this
brew
i
love
this
i
like
sours
but
this
isnt
totally
there
its
definitely
a
unique
brew
which
russian
river
just
seems
to
be
so
capable
of
producing
now
there
is
a
certain
residual
property
which
lingers
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
as
it
builds
up
with
continued
draws
im
not
sure
how
to
classify
it
but
it
is
a
residual
of
some
sort
not
quite
chemical
not
completely
organic
and
not
always
present
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
great
brews
to
have
tasted
i
completely
bow
down
to
russian
river
for
the
successes
very
rich
very
pronounced
properties
a
little
more
difficult
to
acquire
down
here
in
orange
county
and
definitely
one
you
need
to
grab
if
you
ever
find
it
on
the
shelf
if
youre
open
to
a
slightly
sour
brew
rescued
the
day
compared
to
that
alaska
mikkeller
this
is
heaven
serving
type
bottle
053013
i
want
another
to
age
what
can
you
say
about
temptation
that
hasnt
already
been
said
a
million
times
its
a
masterpiece
nearly
flawless
with
the
exception
of
some
personal
preference
towards
appearance
and
mouthfeel
even
still
it
gets
incredibly
high
marks
there
its
a
wonderfully
tart
and
refreshing
beer
with
the
most
pleasantly
subtle
oaky
chardonnay
background
this
is
a
prime
example
of
how
to
use
brett
in
a
beer
its
vinous
and
effervescent
and
just
awesome
overall
i
loved
this
beer
it
was
almost
as
good
as
consecration
and
supplication
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
sours
of
all
time
the
wine
barrel
aging
really
makes
this
as
it
does
the
other
russian
river
sours
well
done
must
try
for
everyone
at
some
point
definitely
worth
trying
its
not
über
complex
but
its
got
that
good
sour
quotient
and
a
bit
of
complexity
to
it
russian
rivers
other
sour
offerings
are
more
complex
and
flavourful
but
if
you
are
new
to
sours
this
is
one
i
would
definitely
try
first
before
all
the
other
sours
o
a
pleasurably
fun
light
ale
with
the
belgian
twist
one
of
the
more
memorable
sours
ive
enjoyed
whoa
this
packs
a
punch
loaded
with
tart
characters
and
finishes
so
dry
more
lemon
and
tart
cherries
with
biscuitybread
to
back
it
up
so
easy
to
sip
the
bottle
doesnt
last
nearly
long
enough
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
you
will
have
the
chardonnay
character
and
the
brett
go
so
well
together
the
oak
is
understated
but
adds
depth
and
the
malt
is
superbly
light
crisp
fresh
billowing
and
ample
this
is
a
beer
you
can
linger
over
and
really
appreciate
its
indulgence
temptation
is
one
of
my
favorite
sours
to
date
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
in
all
aspects
that
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
the
tartness
of
this
beer
comes
across
ridiculously
well
thanks
again
for
picking
these
up
derek
jd
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
russian
river
as
close
to
a
gueuze
that
youre
going
to
get
in
america
this
beer
aged
very
well
it
aged
so
well
that
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
in
my
cellar
this
was
one
of
those
beers
that
had
a
lot
going
on
in
it
but
nothing
really
controlled
this
beer
every
flavor
and
aroma
had
the
same
amount
of
time
in
the
spotlight
i
would
love
another
bottle
of
this
review
900
note
batch
072712
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
interesting
due
to
the
great
balance
of
flavorsaromas
with
just
enough
complexity
love
the
use
of
brett
in
this
beer
because
it
enhances
and
does
not
dominate
o
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
words
cant
express
how
perfect
it
is
for
an
american
wild
ale
its
honestly
a
benchmark
beer
for
a
sour
blonde
really
nice
play
from
the
oak
barrels
good
mix
of
fruit
tart
and
oak
o
god
damn
this
beer
is
absolutely
fexcellent
thats
effing
excellent
for
the
phonetically
challenged
i
rarely
get
this
excited
over
a
beer
but
this
one
is
outstanding
for
the
style
from
the
perspective
of
a
person
who
is
a
big
fan
of
the
style
perfect
beer
not
a
flaw
to
it
citrus
funk
lower
alcohol
you
get
the
taste
of
the
barrel
as
well
as
the
fruit
perfect
sourness
not
to
strong
like
the
bruery
and
not
to
light
like
allagash
i
really
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
around
i
think
of
a
better
beer
i
have
tried
all
of
the
other
russian
rivers
and
this
one
seems
to
be
my
favorite
o
510
sourness
another
good
sour
from
rr
still
take
supplication
over
this
but
would
place
it
above
consecration
why
cant
russian
river
ship
their
beers
to
me
i
want
more
of
this
we
have
two
more
bottles
from
the
ation
series
in
the
fridge
cant
wait
to
see
what
those
taste
like
i
now
see
why
the
bros
rated
this
so
high
bravo
russian
river
cheers
bitter
taste
it
took
me
forever
to
finish
drinking
it
if
you
like
nice
gold
or
dark
lager
stay
away
from
this
beer
it
is
hard
to
understand
that
so
many
people
on
beer
advocate
website
like
it
if
this
beer
wasnt
so
hard
for
me
to
acquire
id
drink
it
all
the
time
this
is
up
there
with
one
of
my
favorite
beers
its
so
beautifully
crafted
that
its
simply
complex
if
that
makes
any
sense
complex
in
a
way
that
there
are
so
many
notes
at
work
and
simple
in
a
way
that
they
all
work
together
perfectly
to
create
an
extremely
drinkable
sour
my
favorite
of
the
rr
sours
i
have
not
tried
beatification
though
must
try
the
best
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
im
already
trying
to
find
another
bottle
ive
come
to
expect
a
lot
from
russian
river
and
rightfully
so
temptation
delivers
its
a
sour
motherfucker
thats
for
sure
if
you
like
sours
and
you
havent
had
this
yet
get
some
now
o
much
more
drinkable
and
not
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
actually
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
finished
dry
and
reminds
me
much
of
wine
but
yes
it
is
still
a
beer
great
friendly
american
wild
and
would
gladly
have
someone
try
this
in
hopes
of
converting
them
to
the
sour
side
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
finger
of
foam
with
some
pretty
good
retention
for
a
wild
little
transparency
with
the
yeast
floating
around
medium
carbonation
coats
the
glass
with
some
decent
lacing
smell
of
white
wine
sour
apple
cherry
and
citrus
some
funk
blends
with
a
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
follows
the
nose
well
sour
apple
and
cherry
with
some
chardonnay
a
mild
malt
base
mixes
with
some
alcohol
and
citrus
pretty
solid
feel
crisp
with
medium
sourness
not
much
face
twisting
as
the
rest
of
the
russian
river
sour
line
good
sticky
finish
over
all
another
quality
sour
from
russian
river
however
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
line
so
far
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
ages
overall
awesome
wild
ale
it
doesnt
get
any
better
great
beer
for
my
400th
review
o
great
sour
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
not
super
sour
or
funky
at
all
but
it
is
really
tasty
and
goes
down
really
easy
the
mouthfeel
works
perfectly
with
the
taste
and
although
the
smell
is
lacking
everything
else
makes
up
for
it
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
get
it
if
you
can
yep
o
its
a
kick
in
the
teeth
right
off
the
bat
but
once
you
get
into
it
its
a
pretty
tasty
sour
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
oa
delicious
beer
so
beautifully
blended
and
wellbalanced
odanother
royal
brew
by
russian
river
too
complex
to
ever
fully
describe
too
drinkable
to
ever
fully
feel
satisfied
a
glass
of
this
at
the
brewpub
was
truly
inspiring
o
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
its
style
and
the
extended
aging
made
it
even
better
near
perfection
o
very
nice
awa
the
aroma
is
just
perfect
definitely
draws
some
parallels
with
brett
heavy
belgian
pales
and
the
chardonnay
barrel
adds
a
subtle
but
well
implemented
angle
another
russian
river
sour
that
does
it
right
massively
fruity
and
bit
more
delicate
than
some
of
the
others
refreshing
some
age
will
probably
turn
this
in
to
a
distilled
version
of
liquid
gold
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
from
russian
river
if
you
want
a
sour
that
wont
make
you
whole
face
change
then
this
is
it
overall
never
a
dull
moment
with
rrs
sours
pleasently
blown
away
and
would
drink
thos
on
an
hourly
bases
if
given
the
chance
outstanding
im
not
too
experienced
in
tasting
wild
ales
but
can
say
this
one
is
really
delightful
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
beer
from
russian
river
i
really
loved
this
one
its
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
and
i
thought
it
was
more
well
balanced
than
the
other
rr
sours
ive
had
supplication
and
beatification
thanks
to
douglasjamjak
for
the
awesome
extra
o
drinking
this
makes
me
wish
rr
was
easier
to
come
by
its
a
solid
awa
not
overly
complex
and
very
nicely
balanced
will
definitely
want
to
seek
this
one
out
again
in
the
future
once
again
a
stupendous
american
wild
ale
from
russian
river
as
ive
said
previously
they
have
all
been
wonderful
but
had
their
own
great
twists
and
i
find
myself
craving
each
at
different
times
depending
on
my
mood
temptation
is
a
bit
more
subdued
compared
to
consecration
or
supplication
but
is
probably
a
bit
more
intense
than
sanctification
take
that
with
a
grain
but
give
any
of
them
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
this
is
quite
well
balanced
and
well
made
but
i
feel
like
the
wine
and
brett
dominated
it
not
a
bad
problem
to
have
but
it
made
it
harder
to
find
the
underlying
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
two
fingers
of
head
head
is
white
and
persists
well
throughout
consumption
smells
like
white
wine
and
definitely
sour
style
brew
taste
is
amazing
and
definitely
brings
forward
chardonnay
sour
fruit
maybe
cherries
and
a
long
sour
note
to
finish
great
beerwine
brew
overall
really
refined
complex
tasty
wildfermented
sour
a
standout
in
a
recent
tasting
of
winebarrel
aged
brews
o
as
a
noob
to
sours
and
wilds
in
general
this
is
probably
a
pretty
solid
introduction
this
beer
is
certainly
not
for
everybody
and
im
not
even
sure
the
style
is
for
me
but
this
is
pleasant
complex
and
generally
pretty
refreshing
o
a
good
wild
ale
overall
its
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
but
is
refreshingly
tart
and
sour
overall
another
russian
river
sour
and
another
fantastic
beer
this
always
seems
to
be
the
case
with
them
and
i
am
once
again
extremely
pleased
and
could
drink
this
one
all
night
o
just
a
great
beer
every
sip
is
savored
and
terrific
o
this
was
a
very
nice
sour
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
this
bottle
seemed
like
it
might
have
had
a
little
bit
less
carbonation
it
didnt
effect
the
beer
that
much
though
the
barrel
aging
definitely
contributed
a
nice
presence
to
the
sour
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
beer
out
but
i
definitely
like
some
of
rrs
other
sours
better
might
be
because
im
not
as
big
of
a
fan
of
blonde
ales
as
being
the
bases
for
sours
d
this
beer
is
wonderful
i
can
say
i
prefer
supplication
to
this
one
but
when
available
i
still
buy
it
overall
i
would
call
this
a
pleasant
sour
blonde
ale
its
not
overly
biting
or
sour
i
dont
really
have
a
guess
as
to
what
this
one
is
but
i
like
it
4
o
i
always
say
this
its
a
russian
river
bottleaged
sour
ale
what
are
you
waiting
for
get
one
if
you
can
highly
highly
recommended
very
interesting
my
quest
to
finish
the
top
100
opens
up
yet
another
door
that
i
will
be
walking
back
through
one
of
my
favorites
375ml
b4
pours
with
a
giant
head
nose
is
losing
complexity
with
sweet
vanilla
and
birthday
cake
taste
is
watery
much
too
sweet
either
too
young
or
just
not
up
to
par
edit
just
had
a
batch
4
bottle
of
this
maybe
09
or
something
im
not
sure
the
date
but
it
was
even
more
dry
and
awesome
than
was
the
fresh
one
i
had
a
year
or
so
ago
cellar
this
its
worth
the
patience
oi
really
enjoyed
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
american
wild
ales
to
date
it
had
a
nice
complex
dose
of
sourness
and
a
touch
of
yeasty
goodness
which
really
played
well
with
the
level
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
it
werent
so
damned
expensive
overall
i
think
its
very
very
similar
to
beatification
but
i
like
this
one
better
o
mind
blown
this
stuff
is
insanely
good
initially
it
seems
simple
but
the
more
you
drink
the
more
it
evolves
everything
in
this
beer
just
works
extremely
well
together
well
done
rr
well
done
pours
out
with
just
a
hint
of
hazy
on
a
golden
background
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
persists
forever
with
massive
stickage
the
aroma
is
quite
vinous
with
a
sour
funky
edge
grapes
lemons
cherries
plums
oranges
tartness
sweaty
horses
its
all
in
there
and
it
smells
great
the
first
sip
pierces
my
tongue
with
lactic
but
smooths
out
quite
quickly
grapes
candy
sugar
brown
sugar
come
up
front
and
provide
a
great
balance
against
the
lemons
sour
cherries
and
apricots
that
come
in
next
a
bit
of
lactic
and
funk
find
its
way
in
there
towards
the
finish
but
smooth
out
with
a
fruity
sweetness
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
tart
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
wonderfully
complex
and
incredibly
drinkable
ive
had
this
in
the
cellar
a
few
years
and
have
lost
track
of
where
i
got
it
if
you
sent
it
to
me
thank
you
so
much
o
fantastic
this
stuff
is
so
good
its
dangerous
not
from
an
abv
standpoint
but
the
price
point
like
sushi
pairs
very
well
with
food
where
you
would
otherwise
drink
a
white
wine
o
the
lightness
is
great
and
the
carb
is
perfectly
spritzy
great
tartness
with
a
nice
lactic
sourness
overall
i
didnt
think
rr
could
top
consecration
but
they
did
with
this
particular
beer
i
wish
i
had
access
to
their
work
on
a
regular
basis
so
i
feel
like
every
time
i
drink
a
beer
of
theirs
that
i
crack
from
my
closet
im
robbing
myself
of
a
future
delight
but
if
i
dont
drink
it
im
robbing
myself
of
a
current
delight
damn
you
vinny
for
being
so
good
o
how
does
one
describe
delicious
the
chardonnay
barrels
the
funk
the
grape
all
meld
into
a
symphony
i
liked
it
pour
this
in
to
my
russian
river
tulip
clear
golden
straw
body
with
two
inches
of
thick
white
head
that
fizzes
out
at
a
steady
pace
plenty
of
lacing
left
behind
not
a
big
fan
of
chardonnay
and
this
is
dominated
by
chardonnay
that
said
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
i
dont
know
how
they
make
it
work
but
they
do
as
far
as
smell
and
taste
this
is
straight
chardonnay
nothing
else
mouthfeel
is
very
lively
with
more
carbonation
in
a
sour
than
i
have
experienced
kinda
a
medium
thin
body
drinks
like
champaign
overall
ireally
like
it
heck
i
might
even
try
another
chardonnay
nah
ill
stick
to
beer
appears
hazy
royal
gold
with
ample
pure
white
fluffy
lacybeyondbelief
head
that
crowns
the
glass
and
stays
there
as
a
halffinger
cap
aroma
is
melon
funky
floral
notes
and
lemon
citrus
smell
keeps
developing
with
time
with
the
lemonflower
scent
coming
through
after
the
initial
oakmelon
taste
is
intoxicating
with
light
fruit
initially
and
a
woody
finish
with
plenty
of
others
in
between
including
yeast
funk
white
wine
and
a
tart
carbonation
kick
throughout
beer
is
light
while
being
wellbodied
and
leaves
a
nice
dry
coat
around
the
mouth
somehow
it
all
comes
together
for
me
chardonnay
isnt
my
favorite
but
rr
makes
it
work
here
thanks
for
the
trade
a
long
time
ago
stupac2
o
really
impressed
by
this
sour
from
rr
lots
of
wine
qualities
from
the
barrels
and
a
nice
amount
of
sourness
that
isnt
overpowering
ill
take
this
over
beat
b5
any
day
of
the
week
very
light
and
crisp
with
nice
wood
notes
funkiness
was
there
but
not
over
the
top
sour
but
not
puckering
the
chardonnay
is
pronounced
but
is
nice
just
a
subtle
but
very
well
done
sour
o
really
amazing
wild
but
i
still
love
supplication
the
best
this
is
a
nice
sour
from
rr
i
like
supplication
a
bit
more
but
id
recommend
this
one
o
soso
sour
im
not
huge
on
sour
ales
so
its
always
hard
for
me
to
get
used
to
them
but
this
is
pretty
good
for
one
o
another
fine
sour
from
russian
river
i
would
rank
supplication
slightly
higher
in
sourness
since
temptation
is
less
intense
on
balance
this
is
a
good
beer
its
just
unfortunate
that
the
flavor
is
my
least
favorite
part
its
dominated
by
the
barrel
in
the
same
way
that
many
rough
bourbonbarrelaged
beers
are
i
want
more
beer
or
more
sour
and
less
chardonnay
o
splendid
huge
complexities
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
worth
the
price
tag
cheers
this
is
not
my
favorite
sour
from
russian
river
that
is
still
supplication
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
combination
of
fruit
sour
and
stony
dryness
makes
this
beer
taste
like
a
nice
mellow
gueuze
fans
of
sours
and
gueuzes
should
definitely
try
to
get
this
its
wonderful
that
an
american
brewer
is
making
such
unique
distinctive
beers
but
its
criminal
that
they
arent
distributed
more
widely
here
in
ky
we
have
to
trade
for
them
and
when
i
say
we
have
to
trade
i
mean
we
absolutely
must
theres
just
nothing
like
these
anywhere
outside
of
california
good
but
pretty
dry
i
dont
love
chardonnay
but
if
you
do
this
would
be
pretty
great
though
not
immediately
wowed
by
this
beer
i
fell
deeply
in
love
with
it
during
the
session
its
subtle
and
delicate
yet
bright
and
bold
some
great
fruity
notes
paired
with
some
soft
sourness
being
aged
for
nearly
a
year
in
oak
barrels
i
was
expecting
more
wood
in
the
aroma
very
light
and
finish
nonexistent
stellar
mouthfeel
i
am
very
jealous
of
those
whom
have
this
at
their
local
liquor
stores
throughout
the
year
very
pleasant
beer
well
integrated
complex
flavors
i
prefer
this
to
its
closest
kin
sanctification
d
majesty
its
beers
like
this
that
make
me
proud
to
be
from
california
original
review
on
09132010
had
this
at
city
beer
store
in
san
francisco
they
said
this
was
batch
4
pours
a
clear
bright
yellow
at
first
then
turns
hazy
on
the
second
and
third
pour
tastes
nicely
sour
with
oak
notes
coming
through
on
the
finish
very
refreshing
and
it
has
the
right
amount
of
sourness
this
brewery
is
fucking
awesome
o
overall
this
is
definitely
a
keeper
damn
expensive
13
99
for
a
375ml
but
worth
it
great
job
of
creating
the
sour
aura
but
maintaining
balance
and
drinkability
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
wild
ales
sours
and
to
those
who
are
just
in
the
mood
for
something
different
and
unique
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
wish
i
had
more
of
it
laying
around
amazing
tartness
with
some
great
complexity
behind
it
the
more
sours
i
drink
the
more
i
like
them
and
this
is
a
great
example
i
like
the
chardonnay
barrel
choice
it
works
quite
well
once
again
i
need
to
thank
the
most
awesome
rutager
for
this
one
conclusion
this
beer
is
not
for
everyone
obviously
i
tend
to
agree
with
the
lowend
reviews
for
this
brew
more
so
than
the
high
ones
truthfully
its
mostly
hype
the
fancy
bottle
complicated
process
high
price
and
perceived
exclusivity
of
russian
rivers
brews
are
great
marketing
but
do
nothing
to
enhance
the
taste
of
temptation
the
best
thing
this
has
going
for
it
is
that
its
a
great
thirst
quencher
in
the
same
vein
as
a
bavarian
hefeweizen
on
its
own
its
just
a
little
onesided
and
boring
id
recommend
treating
it
like
wine
and
having
it
with
food
on
the
other
had
you
could
always
just
buy
some
wine
quite
a
conundrum
this
drink
is
after
a
hohum
pour
its
terrific
with
a
tartness
that
evokes
grapes
and
lemons
and
gets
your
salivary
glands
going
whether
you
want
them
to
or
not
delicious
but
what
the
hell
is
it
theres
so
much
tart
chardonnay
its
crossed
over
from
being
a
beer
to
being
something
else
its
as
much
wine
as
it
is
beer
and
in
many
ways
its
no
more
beer
than
a
malternative
is
still
a
great
drink
but
ive
penalized
the
overall
rating
for
the
identity
crisis
o
very
good
and
very
drinkable

as
far
as
sour
ales
go
d
incredibly
easy
drinking
even
with
the
sour
funky
flavors
on
the
palate
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
really
a
quality
brew
from
rr
very
light
and
crisp
with
a
dry
tart
finish
i
found
this
to
be
highly
drinkable
temptation
pours
a
burnt
yellow
orange
at
first
glance
but
when
held
up
to
light
its
more
of
a
lemon
yellow
at
its
peak
theres
two
fingers
worth
of
a
frothy
white
crown
retention
is
very
good
but
the
lacing
is
spotty
the
aroma
starts
out
being
dominated
by
the
aroma
of
chardonnay
with
just
a
hint
of
funk
in
the
background
though
as
the
beer
warms
though
the
balance
between
the
two
evens
out
some
still
i
was
looking
for
a
little
bit
more
in
the
way
of
complexity
whatever
i
didnt
find
in
the
nose
made
itself
apparent
as
i
sipped
on
temptation
the
taste
of
sweet
apples
shows
up
first
before
a
brief
subtle
flash
of
clove
reminds
me
that
brett
and
other
wild
critters
werent
the
only
things
used
to
ferment
this
beer
the
back
half
of
the
beer
is
all
chardonnay
and
sourfunk
and
the
two
are
almost
entirely
intertwined
im
not
always
a
fan
of
chardonnay
i
find
it
to
be
a
bit
harsh
in
general
but
the
flavor
here
has
a
bit
more
of
a
soft
edge
the
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
luxuriant
for
a
beer
so
dry
its
not
thin
at
all
and
the
carbonation
is
picture
perfect
very
expressive
without
treading
into
fizziness
i
honestly
cant
think
of
a
single
thing
id
change
about
it
with
an
out
of
this
world
flavor
and
mouthfeel
and
a
restrained
sourfunky
contribution
from
a
relatively
fresh
bottle
makes
this
an
incredible
easy
drinker
nice
wild
ale
the
oak
isnt
apparent
until
the
finish
and
the
carbonation
is
just
a
bit
more
than
i
prefer
the
mouthful
is
nice
and
not
to
thin
or
viscous
its
almost
like
a
saison
with
brett
added
i
get
some
peach
and
white
grapes
that
im
guessing
comes
from
the
yeast
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
wild
ale
to
introduce
people
to
brett
c
its
too
funky
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
dont
think
this
is
one
is
too
complex
but
all
in
all
a
solid
offering
from
russian
river
this
is
the
first
sour
that
ive
had
that
i
could
enjoy
multiples
of
a
very
well
crafted
brew
two
thumbs
up
and
one
bottle
down
m
light
body
with
big
carbonation
skål
if
you
asked
me
if
i
wanted
another
one
of
these
i
would
not
be
tempted
dont
miss
this
i
waited
a
whole
year
before
giving
in
and
buying
this
obviously
expensive
bottle
dont
wait
too
long
ive
been
set
up
with
this
beer
a
handful
of
times
now
by
different
bas
so
thanks
a
lot
guys
poured
into
a
tulip
just
as
the
bottle
instructs
me
to
the
pour
is
a
very
clean
light
golden
color
with
just
a
thin
fizzy
layer
of
foam
and
spotty
lace
as
soon
as
i
pooped
the
cork
on
this
i
got
a
big
lemon
aroma
the
nose
is
full
of
lemon
hints
of
oak
and
cedar
sour
grapes
and
a
bit
of
brett
and
balances
the
aromas
very
nicely
letting
everything
meld
together
to
compliment
the
taste
is
lemony
right
off
the
bat
nice
and
sour
with
a
little
bit
of
wood
and
chardonnay
flavor
and
a
nice
funky
brett
finish
honestly
excactly
what
i
would
want
from
a
wild
ale
sour
and
funky
but
not
overpoweringly
just
a
nice
brett
and
sour
balance
with
other
flavors
showing
their
profiles
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
but
no
complaints
really
and
the
drinkability
is
like
none
other
i
could
sip
this
guy
all
night
another
delicious
and
well
done
beer
by
russian
river
i
really
enjoyed
the
subtleties
of
this
beer
as
it
relied
only
on
the
beer
itself
and
the
barrel
aging
a
sour
blonde
with
some
cloudiness
and
a
smaller
head
golden
yellow
tone
with
a
nose
brett
and
oak
the
palate
is
a
husky
quite
of
malt
with
a
wooden
mineral
blending
within
it
nice
balance
of
brett
sour
and
grape
mild
sour
mineral
the
mineral
quality
is
almost
chalky
with
a
quality
of
grape
skins
bitter
and
a
floral
hoppy
note
in
there
hard
on
the
teeth
in
the
amount
of
sugar
used
still
a
wonderful
experience
would
say
that
the
brute
seems
to
have
a
better
feel
yet
this
is
a
bit
broader
in
palate
as
mild
as
the
body
comes
at
you
popped
this
last
night
and
was
so
pumped
to
do
so
i
have
had
this
many
times
on
tap
and
bottle
but
just
reviewing
it
now
the
smell
makes
my
mouth
water
and
the
taste
of
tartness
makes
me
drool
this
was
not
as
sour
as
i
remember
it
being
but
wonderful
none
the
less
i
could
drink
this
all
night
verdict
world
class
sour
ale
likely
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
off
the
charts
expensive
overall
a
great
drink
i
could
easily
enjoy
too
much
of
this
especially
because
it
is
just
so
refreshing
which
is
very
nice
for
a
wild
ale
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
but
unfortunately
i
am
reviewing
this
in
november
d
wonderfully
complex
and
unique
i
wish
i
had
access
to
it
regularly
because
i
think
it
would
pair
amazingly
with
food
the
bottle
specifically
says
not
to
pour
the
yeast
sediment
but
i
cannot
allow
myself
to
review
a
beer
until
the
bottle
is
finished
and
i
wont
deduct
points
for
character
that
the
yeast
will
add
but
i
have
to
explore
and
try
it
the
added
yeast
does
not
change
the
aroma
but
seems
to
dim
the
sourness
and
add
a
yeast
character
very
interesting
flavor
different
yet
equally
good
give
it
a
try
sometime
dreally
nice
not
overpoweringly
sour
excellent
brew
im
not
surprised
since
russian
river
seems
to
have
figured
out
how
to
brew
very
good
beer
across
a
spectrum
with
amazing
consistency
heres
just
another
example
my
wild
ale
shy
wife
concurs
she
thinks
its
great
winner
a
very
complex
and
interesting
sour
it
borrows
a
lot
of
flavors
from
a
white
wine
combining
them
with
some
funkiness
tartness
and
sourness
d
awesome
i
wish
i
had
some
more
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
its
weighted
palate
impression
requires
paced
consumption
but
there
is
nothing
fatiguing
here
and
the
relatively
low
abv
and
slow
pace
of
consumption
allows
for
extended
drinking
lighter
body
tingly
and
dry
dances
on
the
tongue
with
excellent
flavor
and
feel
goes
down
so
easy
you
have
to
consciously
slow
yourself
down
to
avoid
drinking
it
too
fast
a
true
delight
and
treasure
from
russian
river
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
about
this
beer
because
of
all
the
hype
it
gets
and
the
cost
15
for
330ml
but
i
think
it
was
worth
every
penny
one
of
the
best
american
wild
ales
i
have
ever
had
im
going
to
make
it
a
point
to
pick
up
the
other
three
russian
river
sours
available
in
the
area
when
i
can
afford
them
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
more
so
that
so
of
the
wild
ales
with
cherries
drinkability
is
fine
as
i
mention
above
i
like
the
emphasis
on
the
underlying
funk
as
opposed
to
inherent
tart
sour
qualities
im
also
a
fan
of
the
more
reasonable
abv
allowing
for
such
a
spectrum
of
flavors
without
hovering
in
the
10
range
poured
from
a
bottle
shared
with
leafs93
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
champagne
like
ultra
thin
white
head
has
a
tart

with

has
a

crisp
very
gentle
bitters
on
the
backend
excellent
brew
they
know
how
to
make
sours
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
great
sour
and
tart
flavors
to
it
overall
with
some
great
depth
an
excellent
american
wild
ale
overall
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
i
cant
find
any
russian
river
in
ohio
so
this
is
a
real
treat
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
finelycrafted
sour
beer
wellrounded
flavorful
and
drinkable
absolutely
one
of
the
more
complex
and
rewarding
beers
ive
tried
i
wish
i
was
able
to
have
it
more
often
but
price
and
availability
make
this
one
a
special
occasion
brew
pours
a
pure
golden
hazed
hue
with
a
bright
effervescent
white
head
forming
thick
in
my
chalice
aromatics
offer
up
funky
brett
tones
with
hints
of
white
wine
acidity
earthy
herbal
sour
ale
notes
this
is
something
special
for
sure
flavor
has
funky
horse
blanket
that
coats
the
palate
with
acidity
of
the
chardonnay
barrels
the
brett
and
pedio
are
wild
this
ale
is
sour
puckeringly
so
with
barrel
aged
effects
going
on
as
well
funky
yogurt
notes
barrel
aged
oak
sharp
acidic
tones
this
is
pure
sour
ale
mouthfeel
is
dry
carbonation
is
effervescent
body
is
in
the
medium
range
ive
had
some
nice
sour
ales
recently
this
one
is
a
bit
rough
with
barrel
aging
but
it
works
drinkability
is
fantastic
the
type
of
sour
ale
that
puckers
your
mouth
and
gives
you
a
full
range
of
flavors
during
each
sip
its
time
to
just
make
a
pilgramage
to
the
west
coast
and
visit
santa
rosa
d
only
wish
i
didnt
have
to
shell
out
so
much
to
enjoy
this
beer
money
aside
outstanding
beer
not
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
often
but
certainly
to
be
enjoyed
the
sour
quality
of
this
beer
is
not
overwhelming
which
makes
it
a
highly
drinkable
sour
overall
another
great
russian
river
beer
and
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
personally
the
balance
of
flavors
and
the
subtly
of
all
the
components
is
brillant
definitely
seek
this
out
my
second
offering
from
russian
river
and
it
was
just
as
amazing
as
the
first
i
cant
remember
who
i
traded
for
this
but
if
your
out
there
thank
you
2010
d
one
of
most
wellcrafted
beers
that
ive
ever
had
and
perhaps
my
favorite
rr
beer
yet
other
than
pliny
and
maybe
consecration
this
beer
is
so
clean
and
drinkable
its
scary
over
a
year
of
aging
has
only
dried
this
beer
out
and
made
it
even
more
complicated
well
worth
the
price
if
you
can
get
a
bottle
the
7
5
abv
is
also
quite
hard
to
pick
out
making
this
an
easy
drinking
wild
ale
while
it
may
not
be
one
of
the
most
assertive
of
the
russian
river
beers
its
still
a
great
effort
that
could
benefit
from
more
distribution
please
d
easily
drinkable
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
for
a
nice
flavor
but
it
just
doesnt
blow
me
away
i
can
go
to
the
store
and
easily
find
several
other
sours
that
i
would
prefer
over
this
one
i
think
i
will
revisit
my
other
bottles
at
least
a
year
in
the
future
and
hope
they
have
developed
nicely
d
great
i
love
this
beer
and
want
more
i
mean
this
sucks
and
dont
buy
it
fantastic
beer
still
a
bit
of
a
reach
for
17
375
ml
but
worth
one
try
for
sure
im
a
believer
in
all
this
rr
stuff
but
i
guess
i
could
pay
17
for
a
750
of
cantillon
and
that
would
make
me
similarly
happy
overall
a
verynice
sour
not
as
complex
as
a
supplication
or
consecration
but
smoother
and
easier
to
drink
not
as
sour
as
the
other
two
either
i
probably
like
this
a
little
less
then
supplication
but
its
still
a
completely
amazing
beer
from
russian
river
perfection
has
never
tasted
so
good
and
by
perfection
i
refer
to
sour
blondes
then
beer
pours
out
a
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
head
that
resides
a
little
too
quickly
in
the
nose
fruit
chardonnay
slight
oak
and
a
perfect
amount
of
funk
from
the
brett
the
taste
displays
the
same
notes
but
the
flavors
are
accentuated
by
the
ultradry
finish
and
slight
bitterness
the
refreshing
lactic
bite
but
nit
overpowering
sourness
make
temptaion
unbelievably
drinkable
killer
beer
it
poured
from
the
bottle
with
a
nice
head
it
is
paleyellow
straw
color
the
aroma
had
sour
and
winelike
notes
flavors
included
floral
lemon
maybe
a
touch
of
grass
and
white
wine
characteristics
smooth
clean
finish
wow
what
a
great
beer
absolutely
delicious
very
nice
the
beer
is
a
light
gold
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
thick
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
yeast
along
with
light
malts
tart
fruit
and
some
hops
plus
the
typical
scent
of
oak
barrelaging
the
taste
is
very
tart
and
sour
up
front
and
on
top
of
that
escalates
into
a
sharp
bite
with
flavors
of
yeast
lemon
green
apples
and
some
spice
that
lingers
in
the
finish
theres
a
decent
hops
presence
that
brings
some
balance
the
malt
character
is
pretty
thin
the
aftertaste
is
sour
and
slightly
bitter
smooth
and
very
crisp
light
body
mediumtohigh
carbonation
clean
and
very
dry
finish
this
beer
isnt
the
most
drinkable
but
it
is
something
i
could
enjoy
drinking
often
i
was
quite
happy
with
this
beer
yet
another
world
class
sour
from
russian
river
d
hell
yeah
just
enough
sourness
to
get
you
going
not
offputting
at
all
flavors
are
nice
and
mellow
great
beer
overall
an
impressive
wild
ale
and
worthy
of
the
accolades
and
for
seeking
out
drinkability
this
is
far
from
a
sessionable
beer
at
least
for
my
tastes
but
thats
not
the
goal
with
a
beer
like
this
i
might
not
have
another
but
id
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
who
wanted
to
explore
beer
into
this
style
mouthfeel
was
light
bright
spritzy
on
the
tongue
it
would
be
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
several
pints
of
this
if
it
werent
very
hard
to
get
in
alabama
and
not
so
expensive
great
stuff
i
would
have
this
beer
every
day
if
i
could
drinkability
a
unique
take
on
the
style
nice
complexity
from
the
wine
barrels
this
beer
is
a
trifecta
of
drinkable
refreshing
and
complex
i
find
most
sour
beers
difficult
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
with
this
beer
i
could
throw
back
a
few
and
still
enjoy
it
seems
to
be
the
most
sessionable
of
the
tion
sours
i
have
had
so
far
another
big
time
win
from
vinnie
medium
body
beer
drinks
very
easily
the
excellent
carbonation
combined
with
the
oak
makes
for
a
good
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
beer
that
can
convert
anyone
into
a
wild
ale
fan
a
damn
good
beer
but
for
the
price
im
still
disappointed
perhaps
it
needs
time
to
open
up
rr
recommends
cellaring
for
up
to
5
years
on
all
of
their
oakaged
beers
i
will
try
that
and
come
back
to
it
drinkability
awesome
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
really
tart
the
wild
feel
is
welcoming
and
sweet
to
the
taste
buds
if
you
have
this
beer
it
is
a
pleasure
of
the
senses
it
really
is
what
most
brewers
dream
of
achieving
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
sours
pours
a
hazy
strw
orange
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
and
fine
champagne
like
bubbles
on
the
nose
you
pick
up
granny
smith
apples
citrus
with
notes
of
oak
and
chardonnay
the
palate
is
fantastic
with
apple
flavors
followed
by
oak
brett
and
small
amoutn
of
baking
spice
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
a
must
try
for
any
sour
beer
nut
pours
a
nice
somewhat
hazy
orange
color
with
a
minimal
amount
of
white
foam
on
top
not
surprisingly
this
one
was
a
bit
funky
but
not
particularly
sour
aromas
of
chardonnay
oak
green
grapes
and
brett
on
the
palate
i
get
more
of
the
same
funky
brett
green
apples
and
oak
a
very
nice
beer
damn
what
can
i
say
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
now
in
a
bottle
and
i
cant
choose
which
one
is
better
amazing
beer
and
one
of
my
favortites
from
russian
river
then
again
just
about
everything
from
rr
is
my
favorite
all
in
all
another
fantastic
beer
from
russian
river
an
absolute
home
run
taste
also
has
the
sour
apple
and
green
grape
notes
but
is
more
complex
showing
more
of
the
oak
and
rounding
into
a
nice
faint
bitterness
that
lingers
along
with
the
sour
the
faint
bitterness
is
the
only
noticeable
remnant
of
the
original
blonde
ale
very
very
drinkable
sour
better
than
consecration
but
a
hair
below
supplication
in
my
mind
awesome
brew
d
great
sipping
beer
for
any
day
though
it
seems
fitting
that
im
drinking
this
the
last
day
of
summer
note
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
which
inspired
me
to
purchase
this
bottle
i
must
say
i
enjoyed
the
on
tap
version
slightly
more
than
the
bottled
version
but
did
not
want
to
review
it
while
enjoying
some
beers
with
company
at
the
brewery
however
i
may
up
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
slightly
for
the
on
tap
version
overall
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
wild
ale
feel
is
firm
but
lively
and
light
on
the
pairing
front
temptation
is
a
nearperfect
complement
to
sushi
the
subtle
tartness
melds
well
with
the
vinegar
in
the
rice
but
is
not
strong
enough
to
overwhelm
some
of
the
more
delicate
fish
flavors
d
its
strongest
suit
is
in
its
balance
sour
and
tart
enough
to
ease
a
craving
yet
not
wearing
or
distracting
allows
more
of
the
subtle
flavors
to
not
only
make
an
appearance
but
play
around
a
bit
as
well
something
other
wilds
can
suffer
from
held
up
to
my
hearty
and
sweet
breakfast
a
great
match
have
a
few
more
bottles
that
i
plan
on
aging
well
see
how
it
develops
dr
world
class
this
is
one
to
be
smelled
savored
and
contemplated
md
mouthfeel
is
tart
and
dry
but
full
and
enjoyable
reasonably
drinkable
wild
ale
that
i
wish
made
it
to
the
midwest
md
very
complex
and
full
bodied
there
is
a
very
sour
taste
left
in
your
mouth
but
it
is
still
a
good
drinker
d
good
finishes
clean
with
a
refreshing
quality
full
flavored
and
very
enjoyable
d
this
is
my
favorite
beer
every
time
i
have
it
not
totally
sure
on
the
batch
but
a
killer
one
for
sure
buggy
yes
but
i
still
want
more

all
the
time

all
the

thank
you
eddie

the

is
just
excellent

however
the
batch

temptation
that
i
had
thanks
blake
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
the
last
two
batches
while
obviously
very
good
still
do
not
match
up
to
that
batch
highly
recommended
nonetheless
d
i
love
this
beer
as
ive
said
earlier
but
i
feel
dispite
my
bias
that
this
beer
drinks
beautifully
it
reminds
me
of
an
awesome
gueuze
you
could
drink
everyday
especially
on
a
warm
day
in
the
backyard
with
friends
i
wish
i
could
better
communicate
the
flavors
im
tasting
there
is
just
so
much
going
on
and
combined
with
the
light
dry
mouthfeel
makes
for
one
intense
brew
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
sours
from
rr
overall
i
have
to
give
temptation
two
noms
up
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
indeed
hard
to
drink
much
as
its
so
sour
d
very
drinkable
not
too
sour
d
these
are
real
easy
to
drink
light
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
confusing
on
this
one
its
so
easy
to
drink
with
the
abv
so
well
hidden
and
with
such
a
refreshing
taste
a
solid
wild
m
feels
dry
very
smooth
very
drinkable
slight
pucker
reaction
md
dry
and
champagney
super
tart
these
characteristics
may
put
off

to
others

they

some

i
had
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
and
it
didnt
disappoint
d
for
me
the
drinkability
scale
for
wild
ales
must
be
adjusted
mainly
because
i
find
it
difficult
for
any
such
intense
brew
all
styles
included
to
be
rated
with
a
perfect
5
that
said
i
slowly
sipped
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
temptation
over
an
hour
or
so
this
beer
gets
my
highest
adjusted
rating
for
drinkability
scale
of
1
to
3
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
very
enjoyable
and
goes
down
smoothly
like
many
sours
wild
ales
you
can
only
drink
so
much
before
the
acidic
nature
gets
to
you
its
clear
to
see
why
this
is
so
highly
thought
of
overall
a
solid
heavy
beer
very
well
done
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
drinkable
id
like
to
try
this
with
a
few
years
on
it
i
think
it
could
get
even
better
edit
this
beer
has
lingered
in
my
mind
and
become
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
i
love
the
lightness
and
dryness
of
the
beer
and
really
cant
get
enough
of
it
i
can
resist
everything

girardin
gueueze
comes
to

though

prefer
the

especially
with
the

still
a
very

glad
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
gotta
see
about
getting
some
more
overall
what
more
can
i
say
spectacular
what
a
great
beer
that
is
infinitely
more
sour
from

i
think
i
like
this
more
from
bottle
as
it
mellows
but
this
one
is
excellent
when
young
and
razor
sharp
also
incredible
i
had
on
tap
at
capones
it
was
served
in
9
ounce
snifters
light
turbid
orange
in
color
with
a
little
white
head
the
aroma
was
full
of
funk
steeped
with
a
fruity
backbone
the
flavors
are
somewhat
vinous
and
oaky
it
is
very
dry
and
has
some
lemony
zing
to
it
there
is
also
a
slight
sourness
there
also
a
very
light
bodied
beer
that
leaves
you
dry
the
acidity
knocks
down
the
drinkability
for
me
but
an
otherwise
great
beer
drinkability
this
is
the
most
quaffable
sour
ale
ive
ever
had
it
goes
down
so
smooth
and
is
so
refreshing
how
he
put
this
thing
together
ill
never
know
d
definitely
would
have
this
again
as
just
like
every
other
sour
ive
had
so
complex
and
really
a
journey
from
beginning
to
end
temptation
does
a
couple
of
things
different
presents
a
different
set
of
flavors
not
as
dry
etc
but
all
of
it
works
and
together
create
a
truly
worthy
beer
i
always
thought
id
try
this
in
the
bottle
before
id
get
to
have
it
on
tap
but
nevertheless
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
in
the
bottle
d
an
incredibly
drinkable
awa
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
a
sour
lover
this
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
fluffy
white
head
it
smelled
like
chardonnay
grapes
and
fresh
oak
with
lemon
zest
and
bright
funk
and
coriander
it
tasted
like
tart
and
sour
white
grapes
with
light
funk
and
spices
and
some
burnt
sugar
and
lemon
and
orange
zest
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
great
scent
and
taste
with
just
enough
funk
but
still
very
clean
it
wasnt
too
overpowering
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
but
this
was
still
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
still
need
more
experience
with
brett
and
sour
ales
to
fully
enjoy
this
one
but
i
thought
it
was
tart
and
terrific
im
also
very
curious
how
this
might
age
o
very
tart
light
residual
sweetness
not
a
lot

and
abbey
yeasts
unfiltered
and
aged
for
16
months
in
french
oak
chardonnay
barrels
with
saccharo
and
brettanomyces
it
was
bottled
on
111506
and
conditioned
with
their
house
wine
yeast
and
more
brettanomyces
it
pours
a
transluscent
gold
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
and
two
inches
of
white
head
that
settles
at
an
eighth
of
an
inch
and
leaves
sheets
of
sticky
lace
very
nice
it
is
reminiscent
of
a
wellcrafted
belgian
the
aroma
is
also
quite
belgian
fruity
oaky
and
winey
with
the
addition
of
sour
and
lightly
funky
overtones
if
it
were
a
bit
more
aromatic
it
would
warrant
a
five
in
the
category
on
the
palate
there
are
notes
of
pale
or
pilsner
malts
and
green
noble
hops
blended
very
nicely
with
a
brett
sourness
and
touches
of
white
wine
here
and
there
there
are
additional
notes
of
grassyspicy
hops
a
medium
sourness
a
mild
but
increasing
bitterness
some
drying
tannins
and
oakywiney
notes
that
increase
near
the
end
so
complex
and
completely
delicious
the
medium
body
is
drying
and
lightly
numbing
incredibly
smooth
and
has
medium
carbonation
along
with
a
medium
to
long
finish
overall
an
awesome
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
a
nonstop
sipper
that
is
a
testament
to
the
creativity
of
the
american
craft
beer
revolution
drinkability
after
each
sip
i
found
myself
wanting
more
of
this
beer
it
was
complex
and
tasty
but
not
so
much
to
keep
me
from
wanting
another
bottle
or
two
while
delicious
this
beer
is
not
an
easy
drinker
the
tart
of
the
brew
makes
it
a
sipper
one
to

not
to

got
a
bottle
of
this
at

outside

over

and
i
figure
ive
been
patient
enough
popped
the
cork
and
it
foamed
out
all
over
my
table
damn
i
almost
sucked
beer
out
of
the
tablecloth
but
decided
against
it
got
the
rest
into
a
couple
of
glasses
for
me
and
the

looked

with
a

little
floating
sedimenty
things
bobbing
aorund
in
it
like
theyre

and
they
might

be
smells
musty
and
a
bit
like
an
old
sweet
champagne
also
some
clementinelike
citrus
on
the
nose
taste
starts
out
thin
and
orangey
and
winelike
a
bit
like
a
cyser
i
had
on
tap
at
bells
in
terms
of
the
initial
flavor
profile
some
sourness
that
builds
as
the
beer
warms
citrusy
astringency
bitterness
grows
as
it
warms
which
melds
well
with
the
orange
flavor
some
light
alcohol
flavor
is
apparant
too
thin
effervescent
mouthfeel
all
in
all
its
an
interesting
beer
and
the
first
ive
had
from
the
style
i
think
so
ill
remember
it
i
could
go
either
way
on
having
another
though
its
tasty
but
not
something
i
feel
like
i
could
ever
crave
appeared
a
semicloudy
softorange
color
with
a
white
colored
head
aromas
of
yeast
mellon
white
raisins
and
old
bread
seemed
to
come
out
the
taste
was
balanced
between
brett
flavors
and
crisp
hops
raisins
and
other
fruit
flavors
melted
right
in
adding
great
depth
not
as
funky
as
other
awa
but
still
a
touch
of
that
funkyspoiled
taste
overall
quite
interesting
and
enjoyable
but
not
one
that
i
could
have
over
and
over
again
mouth
sour
and
delicious
entrance
with
a
strange
warm
and
salty
after
taste
in
the
mouth
its
hard
to
pick
the
hops
from
the
malts
its
more
of
a
yeast
and
mold
flavor
same
broiled
steak
taste
as
implied
in
the
aroma
extremely
strong
and
active
carbonation
as
the
brew
warms
more
depth
appears
adding
fruit
and
berry
notes
along
with
a
farmy
hay
flavor
ive
heard
from
a
couple
of
brewers
that
it
can
take
a
few
years
to
really
let
the
brett
do
its
thing
before
these
beers
are
ready
my
hats
off
to
rr
for
taking
the
time
to
do
it
right
as
well
as
create
a
novel
flavor
combination
thats
got
me
anticipating
summer
for
the
rest
of
the
brews
in
the
cellar
buy
em
in
bulk
from
the
brewery
if
you
are
not
local
at
the
price
they
sell
em
its
easy
money
drinkability
incredibly
drinkable
no
perceptible
alcohol
from
my
perspective
i
am
absolutely
floored
by
this
beer
and
will
be
searching
ardently
for
the
rrs
other
wild
ales
d
somewhat
drinkablenot
because
its
bad
but
because
its
so
complex
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
brew
and
one
that
needs
to
be
discussed
whilst
doing
so
extremely
happy
ive
had
the
chance
to
sample
this
the
drinkability
is
near
perfect
for
myself
near
zero
for
someone
who
is
expecting
your
traditional
beer
out
of
this
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
cloudy
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
foamy
white
head
leaves
some
nice
islands
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is

hops
yeast
citrus
orange
grapefruit
pears
apples
and
grapes
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
nice
tangyness
to
it
fruity
and
a
nice
dryness
to
the
finish
very
carbonated
medium
body
a
complex
brew
very
drinkable
this
is
my
second
rr
brew
to
date
love
both
of
them
highly
recommended
d
great
beer
for
a
restaurant
but
i
couldnt
drink
a
few
with
a
ball
game
overall
impression
once
again
a
quality
offering
from
russian
river
incredibly
complex
unique
and
all
kinds
of
great
flavors
going
on
why
oh
why
cant
more
american
brewers
put
out
beers
like
this
d
i
think
this
is
where
this
one
suffersthe
most
it
is
too
much
like
a
wine
and
something
that
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
lastly
its
a
one
and
done
not
only
because
of
the
style
but
at
8
99
for
375ml
its
pretty
pricey
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
itd
definitely
a
different
offering
from
a
great
brewery
but
i
suppose
its
just
not
my
glass
o
beer
this
is
one
of
the
more
approachable
wild
ales
for
beginers
i
feel
despite
that
it
is
a
great
treat
for
any
wild
ale
lover
fantastic
and
well
rounded
in
every
way
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
as
well

my
first
wild
ale
and
im
not
dissapointed
i
love
the
fact
that

brett
in

beer
very
unique
with
hints
of
sour
apples
and
dry
white
oak
wine
and
pepper
spicy
and
funky
but
also
very
tasty
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
one
to
drink
slowly
and
savor
what
can
i
say
this
one
sort
of
blew
me
away
with
a
totally
different
aroma
and
flavor
profile
not
for
everyone
but
one
i
will
definitely
seek
again
if
you
can
get
this
i
highly
recommend
giving
it
a
try
highly
recommended
very
complex
and
satisfying
highly
drinkable
due
to
its
dryness
get
it
while
you
can
this
beer
is
a
masterpiece
i
shouldve
gotten
one
of
those
3l
bottles
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
nice
tartness
bone
dry
with
only
a
feint
hint
of
residual
sweetness
very
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
as
well
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
im
very
much
considering
ordering
some
more
of
this
from
the
rr
website
thanks
again
dogfooddog
im
not
sure
i
could
afford
to
make
this
a
session

i
certainly
would
if
it
were
an
option

love
this

though
d
hats
off
to
vinnie
on
another
fine
beer
i
wish
great
beers
like
this
were
more
readily
available
and
in
750s
as
my
375ml
went
too
fast
clearly
this
isnt
my
style
not
one
ill
be
sipping
again
drinkability
is
great
i
liked
it
at
first
and
really
found
it
grew
on
me
very
interesting
complex
and
balanced
beer
thanks
again
jay
vinnie
is
an
excellent
brewer
he
is
at
the
top
of
the
charts
for
american
brewers
imho
with
the
wine
background
he
has
the
experience
to
make
this
stuff
work
this
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
well
done
lots
of
time
when
beers
are
hyped
up
they
become
a
let
down
not
in
this
case
this
is
the
first
offering
from
rr
that
i
have
tried
if
this
is
any
indication
of
their
other
offerings
then
i
can
see
why
the
awards
keep
piling
up
in
santa
rosa
if
you
see
this
and
dont
buy
it
shame
on
you
i
just
wished
they
shipped
to
mi
if
they
did
id
be
celebrating
christmas
and
new
year
with
the
3
litre
badboy
this
is
an
excellent
beer
very
interesting
a
must
try
sparkling
flamed
gold
short
head
of
fine
bright
white
bubbles
that
wilts
to
a
dusting
and
a
tall
collar
fine
drapes
of
lace
cling
to
the
glass
central
spire
of
steady
small
bubbled
streams
sweet
slightly
brett
laced
aroma
melded
with
some
woodiness
and
white

brett
funk
and
a
lemon
zest
edge
lead
into
a
sweet
and
dry
white
winelaced
middle
bright
and
fruity
with
moderate
dryness
the
finish
has
an
ample
amount
of
funk
but
it
does
not
linger
long
the
back
corners
of
the
mouth
instead
are
grabbed
by
a
refreshing
crispness
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
beneath
the
surface
medium
body
with
a
firm
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
and
fine
bubbled
carbonation
nice
overall
and
definitely
drinkable
interesting
american
effort
at
something
very
close
to
a
lambic
wonder
if
they
have
more
aging
more
than
a
year
in
barrel
very
refreshing
not
overpowering
and
overall
well
worth
seeking
out
i
could
easily
drink
several
glasses
of
this
easy
to
drink
sessionable
but
i
would
want
to
drink
it
slowly
to
savour
it
ill
take
more
of
this
anyday
d
i
am
surprised
how
much
i
like
this
for
something
tasting
so
much
like
a
white
wine
it
is
very
complex
and
i
love
that
in
a
beer
it
is
strangely
appealing
from
what
i
have
tried
so
far
a
truly
unique
beer
i
think
this
one
is
worth
the
money
wow
what
a
unique
beer
if
chardonay
tasted
like
this
i
would
be
a
white
wine
drinker
there
are
just
so
many
different
tings
going
on
here
what
a
remarkable
beer
highly
reccomended
overall
this
beer
is
great
i
think
i
will
go
back
and
buy
more
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
not
too
bad
the
flavors
were
strong
and
pronounced
and
it
was
pretty
wellbalanced
for
all
of
the
flavors
it
had
the
nearest
comparable
beer
ive
had
is
a
gueuze
and
this
exceeds
any
of
those
i
have
sampled
recommended
cheers
i
dont
know
if
i
can
salvage
a
respectable
review
at
this
point
so
ill
close
quickly
russian
river
has
another
platinum
beer
here
thanks
to
vinnie
and
co
for
conceiving
and
caring
for
this
beer

thanks
are

it
swirled
a
nice

a
sweet

sour
brettanomyces
fragrance
reminded
me
of
an
oud
bruin
almost
the
taste
was
tart
without
being
cloying
as
a
sweetness
followed
sour
apple
and
meringue
flavors
were
evident
its
close
in
taste
to
depuration
but
a
bit
sweeter
a
fine
beer
its
the
kind
of
a
beer
that
you
sip
swallow
and
then
chew
or
at
least
smack
your
lips

times
afterwards

with

tingles
in

an
interesting
beer
i
am
still
experimenting
with
the
sour
beers
and
am
still
unsure
how
much
i
enjoy
them
but
ill
keep
trying
every
so
often
i
did
enjoy
both
the
flavor
and
the
dryness
from
the
wood
though
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
coating
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
very
fruity
and
tart
i
pick
up
some
oak
notes
as
well
taste
hits
you
with
the
tartness
up
front
but
then
mellows
to
a
smooth
sweetness
reminds
me
of
a
chardonay
and
even
has
the
buttery
note
to
the
finish
oak
and
vanilla
flavors
become
more
prominent
as
it
warms
overall
a
very
good
brew
i
love
the
effort
that
went
into
this
brew
and
wish
i
had
a
bunch
more
to
drink
i
will
buy
every
russian
river
that
i
can
get
my
hands
on
i
actually
had
beatification
before
this
a
lot
of
similarities
between
the
two
i
actually
preferred
the
beatification
but
as
no
denigration
to
this
beer
temptation
is
amazing
and
worth
every
penny
what
an
unusual
and
tasty
ale
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
another
temptation
is
very
similar
to
the
supplication
as
i
recall
and
i
cant
complain
ill
have
to
try
them
both
headtohead
to
really
understand
the
distinction
hopefully
theyll
both
be
available
at
rrbc
when
i
make
a
trip
up
there
in
about
a
month
woo
hoo
dry
white
wine
and
white
grapes
in
the
flavor
as
it
starts
then
finishes
dry
with
an
edge
of
tartness
funky
and
sour
but
very
subtly
so
fairly
light
mouthfeel
and
a
fizzy
champagnelike
carbonation
light
and
complex
but
comes
off
as
too
weak
especially
for
someone
who
loves
gueuze
d
they
call
it
a
blonde
yeah
a
russian
river
blonde
everyone
other
brewery
in
the
world
would
call
this
a
sour
its
an
intriguing
amalgam
of
farmland
funky
and
aristocratic
wine
country
its
unique
and
a
stretch
but
damned
if
it
doesnt
work
sure
the
abv
is
a
hoot
but
in
such
a
happy
way
and
with
the
tartness
in
play
its
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
why
thinking
outside
the
box
can
be
a
real
good
thing
drinkability
is
great
only
hampered
by
cost
this
is
one
fine
brew
of
many
vinnie
has
going
glad
i
have
another
from
batch

ingurgitate
to
swallow
greedily
or
in
excessive
amounts
gulp
yep
thats
this
beer
to
a
tfunk
if
i
may
add
a
new
adjective
to
my
beer
reviewing
vocabulary
this
one
is
inguritatable
d
wow
this
beer
is
so
complex
and
smooth
yet
too
mysterious
to
describe
it
in
words
the
flavors
of
bret
and
oak
are
soft
enough
to
let
the
blonde
ale
shine
through
but
strong
enough
to
give
it
so
much
more
depth
and
character
i
was
expecting
a
sharp
extreme
american
punch
in
the
mouth
but
instead
i
got
a
beer
that
taste
like
decades
of
craftsmanship
in
the
making
i
wonder
what
a
longer
tasting
session
would
have
yielded
aftertaste
is
very
mild
compared
to
the
flavor
and
the
light
body
leaves
you
wanting

this
beer
produces
tons
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
little
funkier
than
before
some

a
little
salty
with
some
vinegar
almost
like
salt
vinegar
chips
but
strangely
appealing
citrus
flavour
was
more
lemony
and
there
was

the

it
misses

mark
for
me
bottled

very
much
in
the
style
of
a
flanders
red
all
around
very
tasty
with
a
good
balance
between
sour
and
sweet
but
a
bit
undercarbed
for
me
id
happily
drink
this
anytime
im
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
but
given
the
choice
id
probably
pick
up
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
before
this
since
i
could
get
twice
as
much
for
the
same
price
deep
brown
in
color
with
good
clarity
and
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
bubbles
a
fingernail
of
off
white
foam
covers
the
rim
and
only
a
trace
is
otherwise
present
light
brussels
lacing
the
nose
is
packed
with
oak
hazlenut
and
a
trace
of
brett
i
taste
a
very
nice
blend
of
tart
brett
and
earthy
oak
the
mouth
is

carbonated

dry
smell
1st
wiff
sour

vinegar
hints
whiskey
and
oak
taste
very
tangy
and
sour
pucker
reminds
me
of
a
belgium
cherry
ale
very
different
and
may
require
an
acquired
taste
it
is
very
sharp
tart
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
then
gives
way
to
a
dry
chardonnay
flavor
piqued
with
sour
fruit
it
finishes
with
a
pretty
strong
lactic
acid
hit
though
similar
to
duchess
which
is
not
my
personal
style
i
like
my
sours
to
be
more
tart
less
vinegary
for
a
sour
beer
this
is
just
right
in
its
sourness
suggested
even
for
those
who
dont
drink
beer
much
a
2013
bottle
popped
last
night
delicious
but
it
feels
like
its
past
its
prime
not
my
style
i
dont
think
the
flavors
and
spices
work
well
with
the
oak
aging
lots
of
oak
tart
finish
let
it
warm
up
the
flavors
really
come
out
very
good
sour
but
i
feel
its
a
touch
watered
down
damp
and
oaky
and
delightful
perfect
sour
fruit
very
warm
and
inviting
o
a
funkier
oakier
version
of
the
flanders
red
style
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
the
brett
provided
through
it
would
have
been
interesting

never

recently
its
definitely
worth
trying

thought
it
was
good

this
is
a

beer
a

ride
that
does
not
go
too

your

everything
is

o
i
was
incredibly
excited
to
try
this
beer
based
on
the
rating
and
my
love
of
wild
ales
but
this
was
a
let
down
especially
after
the
smell
this
was
easy
to
drink
in
the
sense
that
it
literally
goes
down
like
water
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
anyone
rush
out
to
get
this
beer
o

nice
overall

o
an
outstanding
example
of
a
flanders
or
sour
ales
in
general
belgium
needs
to
take
note
this
is
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
mostly
because
it
is
widely
available
very
consistent
and
solidly
delicious
this
is
defiantly
a
session
able
ale
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
this
is
where
i
point
someone
who
is
new
to
sours

was

but
pretty

for
me

i
do
wish
it
the
beer
was
slightly
more
bold
but
thats
a
minor
complaint
overall
a
very
good
flanders
there
are
better
out
there
but
this
one
did
not
disappoint
maybe
next
years
batch
will
be
better
maybe
jp
need
a
better
quality
control
hazy
brownish
amber
color
with
fine

a
good
take
on
a
flanders
red
that
is
well
executed
but
not
quite
as
good
as
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
aromas
and
flavors
include
apple
cider
lemon
rind
oak
and
vinegar
i
like
how
its
fairly
sour
but
not
too
vinegary
its
also
fairly
sweet
slightly
oxidized
the
fine
prickly
carb
maintains
a
crisp
mouthfeel
despite
the
slightly
oily
texture
straightforward
and
enjoyable
od
this
was
good
a
nice
flanders
red
with
good
flavours
and
some
complexity
not
boozy
and
fairly
tasty
they
flavour
was
subdued
compared
to
other
examples
of
the
style
but
for
the
most
part
this
was
enjoyable
overall
like
many
jolly
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
solid
flavors
while
being
somewhat
lowkey
but
kinda
safeunremarkable
in
the
category
of
funky
saisonswild
ales
that
being
said
its
still
quite
enjoyable
i
especially
liked
the
flandersesque
elements
in
this
one
one
of
the
few
sour
red
ales
that
dont
get
overly
acetic
i
am
particularly
a
fan
of
the
apricot
heavy
brett
character
this
beer
showcases
jolly
pumpkin
does
a
fabulous
job
of
balancing
the
sourness
with
a
smooth
malt
backbone
as
a
sour
red
should
want
a
fantastic
year
round
sour
red
ale
look
no
further
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
solid
example
of
a
american
wild
ale
it
had
just
enough
tartness
to
that
is
a
little
sour
and
it
wasnt
as
acidic
as
some
wild
ales
can
beer
so
i
thought
the
balance
was
pretty
nice
this
beer
beer
had
very
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
not
too
acidic
a
little
refreshing
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
split
but
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
whole
bottle
to
myself
and
i
think
it
would
make
for
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
when
its
warmer
outside
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
the
balance
and
the
drinkability
those
three
things
are
what
made
this
beer
as
good
as
it
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
could
think
that
could
improve
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
if
it
was
a
couple
dollars
cheaper
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
like
to
get
a
bottle
to
put
in
the
cellar
so
i
can
see
how
it
changes
over
time
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
american
wild
ales
and
beers
that
are
on
the
funky
and
tart
side
it
might
even
make
for
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
that
wasnt
always
the
case
but
now
that
ive
got
a
taste
for
these
types
of
beers
i
am
really
starting
to
appreciate
how
good
and
unique
jolly
pumpkin
is
its
not
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
beer
or
american
wild
ale
but
its
far
away
from
being
my
least
favorite
good
job
guys
keep
doing
your
thing
jolly

another
great
sour
from
jolly

o
underwhelmed
neither

nor

sour
the
more
i
drink
the
more
tannin
i
taste
as
i
finished
the
bottle
i
was
left
with
the
sense
of
a
overoaked
flanders
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
would
recommend
others
in
the
same
genre
far
earlier

overall
an

nothing
extraordinary
tihis
is
classified
as
an
american

but
im
pretty
sure
they
were
going
for
a
flanders
red
here
falls
well
short
of
the
classics
in
the
style
atmosphere
is
really
great
brown

slight

notably

overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
m
lighter
side
of
medium
more
carb
would
help
ok
im
not
trying
to
say
im
an
expert
but
many
of
you
need
to
reevaluate
your
scoring
all
i
read
about
this
beer
is
that
its
mediocre
underwhelming
soso
but
you
all
still
manage
to
give
it
a
4
3
is
okay
so
do
the
math
4
means
its
good
it
is
ok
not
the
best
but
just
judge
accordingly
very
approachable
and
unassuming
nice
level
of
sourtart
for
all
levels
very
good
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
wish
it
was
a
little
more
tart
but
the
amber
base
was
great
87
a
unique
beer
i
dont
love
the
spices
in
the
finish
i
do
like
that
it
is
so
different
overall
pretty
good
but
i
find
the
flavours
somewhat
unbalanced
perhaps
it
improves
with
a
longer
time
in
the
bottle
o
i
was
not
crazy
about
it
not
recommended
odi
wasnt
very
enamored
with
this
one
i
would
revisit
it
again
though
and
maybe
rejudge
the
nose
has
a
ton
of
sour
cherries
oak
caramel
earthy
notes
vanilla
bourbon
tart
grapes
and
just
a
bit
of
spice
cinnamon
the
taste
is
really
strong
on
the
bourbon
and
oak
flavors
which
are
immediately
followed
by
mildly
sour
cherries
some
grape
notes
some
earthy
notes
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
nice
dry
finish
it
has
a
full
body
for
the
style
lended
to
it
by
the
oak
i
think
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
clean
dry
finish
just
the
right
balance
of
body
and
tartness
pretty
awesome
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
so
far
as
i
crack
the
cork
this
beer
is
a
gusher
like
a
geyser
this
liquid
is
out
of
the
bottle
and
i
see
some
of
my
well
bought
booze
ooze
onto
the
table
the
geyser
was
quickly
stopped
after
the
first
pour
but
i
would
like
to
warn
others
to
its
gushing
potential
the
beer
pours
a
deep
caramelized
burgundy
color
with
very
light
orange
hints
it
pours
with
a
fair
head
of
medium
sized
lightly
yellowing
bubbles
that
fizzle
down
to
about
a
quarter
of
a
fingers
width
in
the
light
the
beer
is
like
a
ruby
red
grapefruit
color
with
a
dark
opaque
body
that
seems
a
bit
murky
but
does
show
some
nice
lazy
bubbles
running
to
the
head
the
head
leaves
a
light
lacing
of
spatter
marks
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
a
tart
earthy
must
as
the
scent
lingers
in
the
nostrils
i
get
more
distinct
notes
of
cherry
and
leather
much
akin
to
a
flanders
red
but
subtler
a
creamy
scentless
sense
seems
to
dominate
the
nose
which
is
a
little
bewildering
to
me
even
subtler
than
the
funk
is
soft
vanilla
and
oak
as
the
beer
breathes
distinct
lactic
scents
travel
up
from
the
glass
to
give
the
feel
of
a
subtle
flanders
red
this
smells
good
but
i
want
more
of
it
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
a
bit
like
a
muddled
mess
almost
middling
tart
acidity
moves
bad
funk
notes
with
an
odd
light
bitterness
that
moves
into
smooth
tannic
bitterness
while
a
light
earthy
salinity
touches
over
the
tongue
the
sweet
caramelly
malt
in
the
background
is
nice
but
a
bit
watery
leaving
the
beer
without
the
balance
of
the
great
flanders
reds
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
tart
green
apple
with
a
bit
of
basement
must
the
must
grows
to
an
unpleasant
funk
with
plastic
and
medicinal
notes
to
it
within
the
must
there
are
intriguing
hints
of
grass
hay
and
loamy
dirt
but
these
get
caught
up
and
jumbled
into
an
odd
sweetness
falling
into
a
less
desirable
flavors
the
finish
is
of
a
rotting
forest
floor
with
musty
leaves
intertwining
with
decay
and
soft
caramel
notes
and
the
aftertaste
is
nice
tannic
oak
with
vanilla
and
very
faint
light
roast
coffee
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
but
just
does
not
seem
to
pull
its
parts
together
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
thin
lightlywatery
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
fit
the
style
well
carbonation
is
soft
and
smooth
and
actually
quite
nice
though
surprising
given
my
bottles
gushing
opening
the
mouth
is
left
fairly
clean
accept
for
light
acidcanceling
saliva
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
it
has
subtlety
and
grace
in
the
nose
but
it
muddles
everything
in
the
taste
and
never
quite
weaves
them
together
i
wonder
if
a
bit
more
time
in
the
bottle
might
have
aided
the
beer
along
the
beer
does
get
better
as
you
drink
it
and
does
have
some
interesting
points
for
a
seasoned
sourwildetc
drinker
but
is
definitely
not
a
beginners
beer
the
more
i
drink
of
it
the
more
i
note
a
definite
oaky
tannin
to
the
taste
which
i
actually
deeply
appreciate
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
work
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
im
happy
i
tried
it
and
i
hope
it
gets
better
in
future
batches
or
perhaps
with
age
but
for
the
time
being
i
would
say
it
is
not
good
enough
for
its
price
point
o
not
a
bad
beer
when
taken
just
as
an
american
wild
ale
but
relative
to
true
flemish
reds
youre
better
off
with
a
rodenbachgrandcruvintage
o
hard
to
really
judge
this
brew
as
my
only
take
is
2
years
old
and
imo
slightly
past
its
prime
then
again
i
was
lead
to
believe
this
was
cellared
at
a
distributors
andor
importers
warehouse
probably
not
under
ideal
conditions
not
a
bad
beer
by
ny
means
but
i
wont
be
going
back
to
the
shop
for
seconds
overall
great
flavors
make
this
a
really
enjoyable
experience
not
the
most
sour
of
sours
and
a
bit
of
a
let
down
on
the
barrel
character
but
over
still
a
very
nice
beer
that
id
be
happy
to
enjoy
again
o
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
compared
to
the
wild
ales
produced
by
crooked
stave
rr
cascade
etc
this
one
falls
short
its
much
too
tart
fruit
forward
without
any
real
oak
or
lacto
to
balance
it
out
ive
heard
from
my
friends
that
previous
batches
of
this
beer
were
outstanding
but
batch
8
just
reminds
me
of
a
tart
balsamic
vinegar
bomb
a
decent
wild
ale
wish
it
were
cheaper
thanks
joel
overall
this
beer
has
many
layers
of
flavor
and
a
goodgreat
wild
that
i
would
buy
again
o
im
a
fan
there
is
some
tartness
here
but
nothing
off
the
charts
there
is
a
really
nice
harmonization
of
tart
and
malt
sweetness
real
nice
cherry
and
oaky
vanilla
tastes
here
its
not
incredibly
complex
but
the
flavors
that
are
there
work
real
well
overall

la
roja
certainly
is
a
good
beer
but
its
a
tad
expensive
for
what
youre
getting
a
belgian
import
like
rodenbach
grand
cru
is
a
better
value
if
you
prefer
your
flanders
red
ales
very
sour
like
i
do
la
roja
isnt
exactly
the
ticket
for
a
sournessfix
it
has
complexity
for
sure
but
if
you
expected
a
puckering
palate
walloping
this
is
not
the
beer
thatll
do
it
for
you
la
roja
is
an
easygoing
flanders
red
o
a
finely
crafted
beer
with
loads
of
flavor
without
being
overly
sour
o
pretty
good
for
a
readily
available
barrel
aged
year
round
wild
ale
sits
a
little
heavy
on
the
palate
and
lacks
depth
of
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
which
other
beers
in
the
style
seem
to
have
nice
and
tart
medium
body
mild
carbonation
this
is
an
awesome
example
of
an
american
sour
ale
wasnt
sure
if
id
be
a
fan
of
all
the
barrel
aged
flavors
in
this
but
they
worked
out
perfectly
looking
forward
to
throwing
the
yeast
dregs
into
my
homebrew
and
seeing
what
happens
a
solid
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
a
relatively
easy
going
sourwild
ale
that
would
be
nice
to
easy
newbies
into
the
style
without
scaring
them
away
onice
beer
sort
of
a
flanders
red
light
not
over
powering
and
very
drinkable
overall
much
better
than
other
jp
beers
i
was
beginning
to
lose
faith
as
all
of
them
started
tasting
the
same
to
me
this
one
has
a
variety
of
sour
flavors
even
if
it
seems
muddled
and
unclean
a
surprisingly
clean
finish
o
age
has
not
done
the
wonders
to
this
beer
that
i
was
hoping
for
im
going
to
have
to
revisit
this
with
a
fresh
example
this
vintage
whatever
it
may
be
is
just
average
this
beer
isnt
overly
tart
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
the
fruity
flavor
is
pleasant
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
jolly
pumpkin
marry
me
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
again
tart
is
the
name
of
the
game
if
youre
not
disk
with
that
dont
get
this
beer
if
you
are
into
the
funk
buy
it
but
not
if
youre
in
a
region
where
its
14
bucks
a
bottle
unless
youre
bored
and
have
money
to
burn
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
and
i
am
glad
i
did
at
the
price
12it
is
i
think
its
worth
a
try
and
on
some
occasions
but
not
all
the
time
my
third
try
at
jolly
pumpkin
and
my
favorite
by
far
bam
biere
and
bam
noire
overall
a
disappointing
thin
astringent
and
bitter
sour
at
12
for
the
bottle
one
of
the
worst
values
in
beer
i
have
come
across
medium
to
slightly
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
some
liveliness
on
the
palate
in
the
end
this
was
a
perfectly
acceptable
riff
on
a
flanders
brownbiere
de
garde
crossover
but
its
hard
to
say
much
more
not
particularly
exceptional
but
priced
as
if
it
were
at
least
on
the
easy
coast
o
great
take
on
a
flanders
red
in
my
opinion
not
as
fruity
as
other
more
well
known
but
more
on
the
dryer
side
still
a
great
beer
and
will
continue
to
buy
when
ever
i
see
it
at
the
store
got
this
one
at
whole
foods
two
months
ago
very
complex
yet
simple
beer
to
drink
and
savor
not
as
sour
as
expected
but
might
improve
with
age
i
just
could
not
wait
i
had
to
play
with
the
overall
score
to
get
the
letter
rating
i
wanted
this
keeps
my
reviews
fair
and
consistent
please
see
my
profile
page
for
more
information
a
pretty
decent
wild
a
bit
one
dimensional
at
times
but
easily
enjoyable
the
sourness
of
this
beer
is
about
is
about
right
in
the
middle
when
compared
all
the
other
wilds
ive
had
in
the
past
leaves
me
even
more
interested
to
try
the
la
roja
grand
resevera
attractive
rubybrown
semihazy
brew
head
is
rosy
tan
and
initially
large
it
fades
to
a
ring
leaving
little
bits
of
lace
straggling
behind
aroma
is
fun
to
take
in
maraschino
cherries
green
apple
rum
butterscotch
toffee
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
spice
and
something
tart
jolly
ranchers
come
to
mind
though
its
been
along
time
since
ive
had
any
taste
is
crisp
clean
sour
tangy
fruity
fermented
fruity
and
enjoyably
bitter
definitely
some
nutty
stuff
going
on
here
in
an
intriguing
and
mouthwatering
way
theres
something
reminiscent
of
stinky
armpits
in
this
not
to
be
taken
negatively
earthy
and
rooty
flavors
perhaps
rooibos
the
sourness
of
this
grows
on
you
as
you
get
further
in
texture
is
lightweight
and
delicate
grapelike
dry
finely
gritty
slick
throughout
and
generally
lip
smacking
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
i
am
enjoying
this
a
welcome
change
of
pace
o
simply
stated
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
loved
gi
3
sisters
and
i
find
this
one
similar
as
far
as
quality
la
roja
lacks
the
really
intense
fruit
characters
like
gi
but
it
makes
up
for
it
by
adding
in
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
creating
a
uniqueness
of
its
own
in
addition
the
barrel
aging
is
evident
further
expanding
its
complexity
my
first
offering
by
jolly
pumpkin
and
i
must
admit
a
strong
first
impression
o
a
decent
flemish
red
kind
of
disappointed
for
the
price
the
body
is
lacking
a
bit
it
almost
seemed
a
bit
watered
down
surprising
especially
because
it
clocks
in
at
7
abv
the
sourness
and
malt
are
nicely
balanced
it
is
an
easy
drinker
and
an
accessible
sour
edit
ha
just
read
the
description
and
it
actually
says
brewed
in
the
flanders
tradition
nice
to
know
im
not
just
pulling
this
stuff
out
of
my
ass
sometimes
o
another
great
jp
beer
nice
to
treat
myself
to
these
every
now
and
then
while
it
is
a
plenty
enjoyable
beer
the
1015
price
these
goes
for
seems
somewhat
problematic
id
rather
just
pay
a
few
dollars
more
and
have
the
vastly
superior
oude
tart
overll
this
is
my
favorite
year
round
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
really
hits
the
mark
for
balance
as
far
as
american
wild
ales
go
overall
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
beer
and
i
am
not
at
all
disappointed
i
think
it
is
balanced
and
quite
delightful
overall
another
good
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
one
of
my
favorites
due
to
its
sour
qualities
certainly
worth
a
try
by
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
this
style
theres
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
this
beer
going
but
a
consistent
crispness
and
a
wellrounded
smoothness
help
to
make
this
beer
pleasing
all
around
o
overall
a
pretty
good
sour
reminds
me
a
lot
of
rr
supplication
albeit
much
more
mild
great
tasting
easy
drinking
sour
o
super
fruity
and
dry
with
a
great
yeast
funk
great
fruit
flavors
and
a
subtle
caramel
sweetness
that
compliments
the
tart
and
provides
a
smooth
drinker
another
great
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
that
i
will
surely
purchase
again
o
another
solid
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
has
a
nice
tartness
that
doesnt
overpower
i
liked
how
well
the
oak
and
mustiness
were
incorporated
with
it
and
balanced
with
the
tart
overall
this
is
a
very
good
american
brewed
flanders
style
ale
second
only
to
la
folie
nice
depth
in
character
which
i
expect
from
the
style
approachable
for
those
new
to
sours
i
think
about
a
year
in
the
cellar
will
help
this
and
add
even
further
depth
and
a
bit
more
tartness
for
us
sour
fiends
recommended
to
any
fan
of
the
style
or
one
looking
to
get
into
sours
cheers
overall
for
the
price
a
beer
of
this
quality
done
in
the
flanders
style
more
oud
bruin
than
flanders
red
in
my
opinion
is
a
steal
and
lets
face
it
there
arent
that
many
out
there
absolutely
worth
trying
delicious
sour
nothing
offthehook
i
kind
of
like
how
its
halfsour
and
halfamber
makes
for
a
great
beer
one
that
i
had
been
meaning
to
try
for
years
now
rousing
the
yeast
softens
the
acidity
but
paradoxically
increases
the
burn
in
the
back
of
my
throat
the
yeast
also
enhances
the
structure
of
the
nose
bringing
the
leather
more
to
the
forefront
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
jolly
pumpkin
beer
i
should
really
consider
more
of
there
beers
on
a
regular
basis
little
pricey
but
worth
it
o
i
love
this
sour
beautifully
rounded
and
dangerously
drinkable
with
sour
notes
of
apple
and
cherry
skins
over
a
lightly
sweet
backbone
and
a
touch
of
red
vinegar
so
derrricious
o
this
is
my
first
american
wild
ale
and
its
also
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
beer
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
dont
think
its
much
of
a
sipper
as
some
note
as
its
super
drinkable
and
delicious
i
would
buy
again
o
a
nice
beer
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
wild
but
its
still
good
and
its
young
perhaps
itd
get
weirder
as
it
got
older
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
incredibly
sour
treats
and
beers
but
this
beer
does
a
good
job
of
being
somewhere
in
between
the
caramel
and
touch
of
hops
meet
the
sour
fruitiness
and
a
solid
beer
is
the
result
definitely
give
it
a
try
if
you
are
trying
to
get
into
sour
beerswild
ales
as
this
one
will
have
a
fighting
chance
of
not
turning
you
off
of
them

here

the
color

some
suspended

that
eventually
settles
to
the

some
runners
like

lots
of
tiny
piquant
dancers
in

assault
you

eventually
dominating
the
entire

some
nice
complex

amber
malts
happening
dusty
and
bouncing
off
the
sour
notes
really
well
feel
is
solid
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
whole
lot
of
spunk
medium
mody
makes
it
rather
drinkable
and
the
abv
could
be
anything
not
noticeable
at
all
overall
a
great
beer
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
so
far
o
all
things
expected
this
was
a
letdown
this
has
been
in
my
possession
for
awhile
and
i
cellared
it
fine
not
sure
what
the
conditions
were
like
before
me
but
i
assume
sitting
on
a
store
shelf
collecting
dust
not
sure
if
this
was
an
infected
batch
or
what
but
i
am
horribly
let
down
overall
this
is
a
very
good
sour
beer
that
is
not
over
the
top
but
still
complex
tasty
and
drinkable
o
fantastic
flanders
love
a
nice
sour
belgian
beer
ever
now
and
then
this
is

of
the

some

the

pretty
crisp

not

sweet
the
spiced
wooden
earthiness
continues
through
to
the
flavor
and
works
well
with
the
fruit
this
is
tasty
stuff
i
dig
the
sourness
though
the
astringency
is
a
bit
much
in
the
nose
and
detracts
from
the
more
pleasant
aromas
all
around
though
a
fairly
smooth
lipsmacking
tart
experience
and
one
that
i
will
likely
have
again
at
some
point
wood
is
upfront
and
works
well
with
the

nice
balance

great
rustic
aroma
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
wont
be
my
last
impressive
wild
ale
with
charisma
plus
complex
but
well
contained
close
to
a
kriek
stylistically
but
with
a
little
more
yeast
and
malt
action
a
great
beer
the
perfect
intermediate
beer
if
youre
trying
to
get
someone
who
doesnt
necessarily
like
sours
into
sours
theres
two
reasons
i
say
this
first
the
sour
upfront
punch
is
countered
by
jps
incredible
balancing
of
this
initial
sour
with
a
pleasant
sweet
ending
the
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
i
often
feel
that
jp
gets
their
mouthfeel
off
it
always
feels
a
bit
too
thin
but
this
one
is
rich
and
silky
at
the
same
time
a
real
treat
not
much
hops
presence
a
bit
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
its
a
more
citrusy
taste
than
an
oily
resiny
one
which
fits
well
for
the
style
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
into
the
sours
o
i
can
see
this
being
one
of
those
beers
that
you
give
to
someone
whos
not
that
into
beer
and
they
say
this
cant
be
beer
i
actually
like
this
it
definitely
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
with
both
sweet
fruity
notes
and
sour
acidic
notes
not
my
favorite
because
it
smells
and
tastes
too
much
like
wine
for
my
taste
but
still
a
nice
offering
from
jp
overy
good
sour
not
to
intense
but
just
enough
sour
flavor
great
brew
the
caramel
malt
is
more
earthy
than
anything
else
however
the
complexity
already
inherent
in
this
beer
makes
it
a
wonderful
drink
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
pairs
so
well
with
pork
i
really
like
the
tartness
and
the
light
sourness
making
this
beer
very
enjoyable
to
drink
and
certainly
one
that
i
could
enjoy
multiple
glasses
over
a
meal
i
need
to
pick
some
more
of
this
one
up
at
some
point
soon
the
flavor
was
acidic
tart
and
very
refreshing
without
being
sour
in
an
overpowering
way
medium
body
at
midpalate
i
get
some
of
the
contributions
from
the
oakaging
but
its
kept
incheck
by
the
tart
character
of
the
beer
the
beer
claims
to
be
brewed
in
the
flanders
tradition
but
it
lacks
the
accompanying
balancing
sweetness
of
say
a
rodenbach
still
whether
this
beer
is
an
american
wild
ale
or
a
flemish
red
ale
it
is
a
nice
example
of
one
of
the
most
refreshing
styles
of
beer
one
can
find
i
am
overjoyed
that
american
brewers
are
not
afraid
to
produce
beers
in
the
belgian
tradition
if
you
like
sours
dont
pass
this
one
up
bottle
with
dinner
at
blue
tractor
restaurant
in
ann
arbor
this
one
starts
off
a
little
funky
but
really
just
gets
better
as
you
go
along
pours
a
deep
beautiful
red
color
with
creamy
off
white
head
a
great
aroma
of
cherries
vinegar
sweet
fruits
flavor
follows
with
mostly
big
cherry
notes
heavy
sweetness
and
a
funky
tart
unlike
most
other
sour
beers
i
have
encountered
another
unique
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
one
of
their
more
complex
brews
true
to
the
sour
roots
d
this
one
is
a
mixed
bag
excellent
aroma
and
appearance
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
are
a
bit
sub
par
i
have
a
love
hate
relationship
with
jolly
pumpkin
i
keep
trying
their
offerings
to
find
something
that
rivals
the
wonderfulness
of
oro
de
calabaza
and
most
like
this
one
leave
me
greatly
disappointing
poured
from
bottle
with
sticker
blend
2
bottles
1292012
to
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
deep
rich
amber
color
with
a
decent
1
finger
white
head
some
retention
but
not
much
not
much
lacing
like
so
many
of
these
wild
ales
it
almost
appears
flat
the
aroma
is
a
blend
of
a
sour
tart
cherry
with
hints
of
oak
vanilla
and
vinegar
lightly
fruity
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
an
initial
taste
of
the
sour
tart
cherry
from
which
a
grape
fruit
character
builds
vinegar
flavors
hints
of
oak
vanilla
mild
bitterness
no
hint
of
alcohol
very
pleasing
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
a
lingering
sour
cherry
on
the
tongue
overall
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
fantastic
belgian
red
ale
i
wish
i
tried
it
sooner
seek
this
out
d
a
good
wild
easy
drinking
heat
would
probably
diminish
with
age
check
it
out
its
got
interesting
characteristics
from
the
wood
maturation
o
a
very
solid
and
easy
to
drink
sour
fruits
flavors
are
definitely
red
and
refreshing
ive
never
had
this
fresh
but
it
certainly
is
drinking
well
with
a
little
bit
of
time
in
the
cellar
almost
shiny
reddishorange
in
color
with
an
airy
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
smells
of
light
sour
fruits
among
some
plums
and
cherries
caramel
beer
bread
and
taffy
are
noticed
along
with
a
bit
of
musk
taste
is
almost
as
complex
as
the
aroma
with
more
sour
and
tangy
fruits
orange
peel
a
vinegar
afterthought
and
a
distant
oakiness
slightly
puckering
but
not
overkill
goes
down
dry
with
a
medium
body
wild
ales
havent
always
been
my
thing
but
this
one
works
well
on
many
levels
love
the
dark
fruit
and
slight
sour
funk
interplay
on
par
with
the
good
fruity
funky
wild
ales
for
a
beer
this
young
it
is
amazing
how
smooth
it
is
ill
definitely
be
stocking
up
on
more
of
these
next
time
im
in
michigan
a
well
crafted
beer
but
for
me
not
overly
impressive
it
was
well
rounded
tamed
and
easy
to
drink
which
make
it
perfect
for
an
intro
to
the
style
i
wanted
a
bit
more
umph
in
the
flavour
department
but
i
still
found
it
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
a
very
nicely
balanced
american
sour
very
drinkable
without
sacrificing
that
nice
flash
of
puckering
sour
fruit
the
malt
profile
could
be
better
expressed
but
otherwise
delicious
notes
it
felt
a
bit
too
oaky
there
is
a
tad
more
astringency
than
id
normally
like
but
this
is
a
minor
quibble
the
whole
back
end
of
this
beer
is
dominated
by
oak
and
barrel
though
i
would
have
preferred
to
see
a
more
subtle
integration
a
slightly
more
skillful
blend
would
probably
yield
better
results
this
is
a
phenomenal
aged
amber
ale
certainly
in
my
top
favorites
beautiful
amber
color
and
clear
despite
bottle
conditioning
very
short
lived
head
and
no
lace
sour
fruit
and
sweet
caramel
aroma
with
the
sour
fruit
predominating
medium
to
light
body
carbonation
is
perfect
lively
but
not
overwhelming
lots
of
sour
fruit
and
a
medium
amount
of
oak
but
with
enough
sweetness
counterbalance
all
this
bitter
finish
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
with
a
few
unique
characteristics
this
is
the
first
out
of
four
or
five
jolly
pumpkin
beer
that
ive
had
that
ive
been
completely
sold
on
overall
decent
sour
with
some
good
flavors
that
could
be
slightly
amplified
just
a
bit
however
i
like
this
representation
and
would
recommend
this
to
someone
interested
in
getting
into
sours
the
flavor
much
like
the
aroma
hints
at
is
very
tart
and
refreshingly
mouthwatering
bright
fizzy
carbonation
injects
flavors
of
red
wine
vinegar
citric
and
lactic
acids
maraschino
cherries
pomegranate
woody
oak
and
musty
barnyard
funk
the
finish
is
just
slightly
bitter
with
lingering
tannins
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
my
cigar
city
tasting
snifter
upon
opening
it
was
a
bit
of
a
gusher
brownish
purple
in
color
with
a
medium
white
head
light
lacing
the
arom
is
tart
sour
fruit
light
oak
the
flavor
is
moderate
green
apple
pears
definitely
tart
lingering
tart
finish
the
body
is
light
good
carbonation
this
is
an
nice
easier
drinking
sour
smooth
light
body
with
soft
carbonation
nice
lingering
flavors
this
one
has
a
really
nice
balance
good
tart
flavors
with
a
nice
sweet
finish
really
enjoyable
as
most
jolly
pumpkin
beers
are
o
i
am
really
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
thismight
give
this
next
bottle
some
age
and
see
how
it
tastes
after
6
months
or
so
ofirst
wild
ale
i
have
had
so
i
am
still
getting
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
think
it
has
just
about
everything
it
should
its
unique
and
complex
i
would
be
interested
in
seeing
how
it
would
age
overall
a
nice
sweetsour
wild
ale
from
jp
o
overall
a
nice
beer
not
my
favorite
jp
beer
but
seems
to
have
held
up
well
some
light
sour
fruits
and
that
jp
beer
would
have
it
again

from

a

once
popped
my
nose
was
greeted
with
a
rush
of
foam
rocket
once
that
subsided
i
get
to
proceed
rich
amber
in
color
with
not
much

taste
is
tart
mild
raspberry

white

kinda
like
a

decent
but
way
overpriced
pours
an
amberbrown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
falls
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
a
thin
collar
the
nose
brings
a
bit
of
light
lactic
acid
and
some
cherry
a
bit
of
cherry
pit
and
mild
oak
the
flavor
really
pushes
on
from
there
with
some
nice
lactic
presence
as
well
as
cherry
and
cherry
pit
oak
is
good
really
nice
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
acidic
with
a
dry
finish
impressive
another
winner
from
jp
one
of
my
favorite
brews
described
as
an
american
wild
but
i
would
go
as
far
as
to
call
it
a
flanders
red
reddish
copper
in
appearance
thin
head
that
dissipates
but
leaves
lacing
smells
like
only
jolly
pumpkin
beers
can
smell
a
funky
mixture
of
citrusy
vinegary
barnyard
off
flavors
oak
lactic
acid
and
flavors
undistinguishable
yeeeeah
taste
follows
the
nose
the
malt
and
the
hops
are
not
the
star
of
this
show
moderate
carbonation
maybe
a
little
bit
more
than
moderate
gives
a
nice
tingly
feeling
very
vinegary
fantastic

plus
sweetness
tartness
and
bitterness
all
well
balanced
it
has
very
good
character
well
rounded
complexity
and
breadth
and
is
very
drinkable
however
it
lacks
depth
and
seems
a
bit
thin
and
light
as
if
all
the
character
is
on
the
edge
of
evaporating
into
nothingness
i
would
compare
this
beer
to
an
ommegang
zuur
theres
a
good
bit
oak

to
be
found
sour
cherries
tart
green
apples
and
sour
grapes
very
light

and
very
drinkable
the
noticeable
absent
is
the
brett
funk
that
i
seem
to
found
a
touch
of
in
the
nose
but
i
actually
like
its
absence

notes
1212
la
roja
was
one
of
the
first
wild
ales
that
tried
and
i
loved
it
i
still
think
it
is
a
quality
brew
i
just
like
different
things
in
this
style
now
its
tart
but
does
not
have
the
lactic
bite
that
i
strive
for
i
readjusted
my
ratings
based
on
what
i
felt
after
i
recently
tried
nit
still
a
great
soured
brown
and
id
like
to
see
what
this
beast
taste
like
with
some
age
on
it
i
still
think
everybody
should
start
with
this
beer
if
dabbling
in
the
style
as
it
is
a
great
example
of
what
is
to
come
when
drinking
further
wildsours
o
a
fantastic
american
wild
ale
cant
believe
i
didnt
try
out
jps
offerings
before
this
will
definitely
check
out
more
and
will
revisit
this
one
again
when
im
yearning
for
a
sour
ale
thats
both
available
and
somewhat
affordable
od
a
good
wild
ale
for
someone
who
hasnt
had
a
lot
of
exposure
ie
me
sourness
is
mild
but
present
not
overwhelming
a
good
introduction
to
both
jolly
pumpkin
and
the
style
do
tartness
could
be
upped
a
tad
and
would
make
for
a
better
overall
beer
as
is
an
enjoyable
wild
that
fails
to
make
it
to
the
upper
echelon
o
easy
drinking
sour
sour
lacticvinegar
notes
are
excellent
mingled
with
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
and
a
light
graininess
recommend
o
very
good
sour
not
up
with
the
top
but
very
solid
o
while
this
isnt
one
of
the
more
complex
wild
ales
out
there
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
jolly
pumpkin
notes
this
was
still
before
i
could
appreciate
sour
beer
so
maybe
ill
come
back
to
review
this
fresh
again
i
will
say
that
la
roja
is
a
good
introduction
to
sour
american
beer
pours
amberred
with
a
one
finger
head
that
never
goes
away
leaves
great
lacing
aroma
of
funk
vinegar
and
sour
cherries
taste
follows
the
nose
with
funk
and
oak
barrels
at
the
front
tart
and
acidic
but
not
over
the
top
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
sour
o
jp
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
and
this
is
another
addition
to
why
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
poured
a
dark
amber
with
reddish
hues
and
a
creamy
white
head
nice
aromas
of
red
wine
vinegar
currants
oak
leather
and
caramel
taste
is
very
close
to
the
nose
nice
balance
between
tart
funkiness
and
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
light
and
tart
with
crisp
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
wild
ale
shares
a
lot
of
characteristics
of
an
oud
bruin
overall
this
a
nice
beer
with
a
really
nice
flavor
and
nose
slightly
lacking
in
the
look
and
mouthfeel
o
its
a
good
beer
but
could
use
a
little
more
body
a
little
too
dry
for
me
but
i
enjoyed
the
level
of
sourness
good
starter
sour
but
not
one
i
would
search
out
o
overall
its
an
okay
beer
not
the
best
red
ive
had
but
i
wouldnt
dump
it
down
the
drain
either
o
good
not
great
this
is
by
no
means
the
worlds
best
wild
ale
but
its
interesting
enough
to
try
and
keep
a
bottle
on
hand
b
range
serving
type
bottle
sapsuckers
in
huntington
ny
poured
this
beer
into
a
brandy
snifter
glass
and
provides
a
thin
ivory
head
in
the
glass
it
is
slightly
cloudy
with
a
orangyreddish
hue
this
beer
has
aromas
of
oak
cellars
and
fine
wine
on
the
pallette
this
beer
is
funky
with
hints
of
oak
sourness
and
tartness
did
a
good
job
holding
up
to
a
shepards
pie
made
with
venison
sweet
potatoes
a
very
nice
beer
o
a
fantastic
example
of
a
flanders
ale
very
tart
up
front
but
it
isnt
a
one
trick
pony
theres
a
solid
malt
presence
and
plenty
of
fruit
and
citrus
to
help
round
it
out
really
starting
to
dig
this
brewery
o
decent
sour
but
nothing
particularly
special
for
me
oa
very
easy
drinking
wild
ale
but
to
be
honest
was
expecting
abit
more
cheers
o
goddamn
delicious
balanced
in
all
of
its
flavors
extremely
layered
and
extremely
drinkable
o
i
would
consider
this
worth
the
10
i
paid
for
it
it
has
drinkability
but
even
at
a
medium
pace
i
had
a
pretty
decent
buzz
after
this
bottle
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
sour
and
highly
carbed
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
blend
13
2008
this
one
has
been
aging
for
awhile
and
its
noticable
early
pours
a
murky
orange
color
with
a
quickly
dissapating
head
smell
is
light
but
of
vinegar
vanilla
and
oak
from
the
barrels
smells
much
different
from
a
fresher
blend
of
la
roja
taste
is
still
very
good
but
it
has
lost
a
lot
of
that
vinegar
punch
you
would
expect
seems
its
a
lot
more
oak
coming
through
now
and
the
cherries
have
disappeared
too
still
a
very
good
american
wild
ale
but
id
have
to
prefer
a
fresher
blend
o
decent
beer
if
i
can
even
call
it
that
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
wine
than
anything
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
was
worth
trying
o
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
so
far
like
it
better
than
the
bam
my
wife
may
like
the
bam
noire
a
little
better
than
this
for
quite
a
bit
less
money
the
rodenbach
grand
cru
suits
us
both
better
but
this
is
a
very
fine
brew
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
would
prefer
smaller
doses
i
dont
want
a
bombers
worth
of
this
in
a
sitting
as
it
is
interesting
to
start
it
quickly
wears
on
the
palate
and
the
drytart
character
wears
out
its
welcome
i
would
love
to
try
it
with
a
meal
though
o
the
smell
is
absolutely
exceptional
it
smells
more
like
a
freshly
cut
passion
fruit
than
a
freshly
cut
passion
fruit
does
not
sure
why
this
one
doesnt
have
a
higher
rating
it
might
not
be
the
rarest
jp
out
there
but
its
certainly
topnotch
loved
this
one
drinkable
and
nice
complexities
very
worthy
o
good
sour
one
of
the
better
american
wild
ales
i
have
had
i
have
only
had
a
few
though
for
a
straight
sour
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
im
going
to
break
out
of
my
normal
beer
review
format
for
this
one
and
enjoy
man
this
is
a
good
beer
jolly
pumpkin
nailed
another
one
this
american
wild
ale
is
the
best
i
have
had
the
smell
is
so
right
on
it
makes
me
feel
like
i
am
sitting
inside
of
the
oak
barrel
with
the
beer
inside
of
some
darkly
lit
cool
cellar
ive
tasted
many
attempts
at
this
style
that
go
so
awry
how
did
they
get
it
so
right
a
clean
sour
and
some
peppery
taste
makes
me
wish
i
was
really
in
the
barrel
with
this
beer
so
i
could
drink
it
all
if
youve
trained
your
palette
to
enjoy
the
sours
do
not
pass
this
one
up
overall
a
fine
example
of
a
flanders
red
beautiful
in
the
glass
and
that
nice
tart
musty
funky
taste
good
body
not
just
sour
its
more
complex
than
that
o
reminds
me
of
a
kriek
lambic
light
bodied
with
some
complexity
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
grows
on
you
as
the
bottle
level
gets
lower
great
example
of
a
wild
brown
pours
an
amber
color
off
white
head
and
some
lace
formations
on
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
sour
and
slightly
fruity
in
the
taste
nice
and
bitterly
sour
with
some
berry
fruity
notes
wine
like
oaky
some
woodsy
tannins
and
tart
the
whole
way
through
wine
like
in
its
alcohol
strength
too
a
little
tart
with
a
burn
semi
dry
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
overall
a
really
nice
treat
sour
fruity
light
spice
and
very
oaky
a
fine
candidate
for
cellaring
like
it
a
lot
really
hits
the
spot
if
you
are
going
for
a
dry
flemish
red
made
in
the
states
d
roja
doesnt
get
nearly
the
credit
it
deserves
as
one
of
the
better
yearround
and
very
available
sour
beers
in
the
u
s
its
the
closest
thing
i
have
to
a
traditional
belgian
unblended
lambic
i
have
had
from
the
states
the
beer
appears
dark
ruby
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
brings
funk
wild
yeast
oak
cherries
assorted
fruit
really
nice
flavor
complex
sour
delicious
i
am
a
happy
guy
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
now
while
this
is
not
necessarily
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
though
jeff
may
disagree
due
to
the
brash
complexity
and
unorthodox
nature
of
the
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
sour
cherries
with
a
healthy
sour
lactic
presence
the
beer
in
some
regards
reminds
me
of
russian
river
consecration
which
is
a
very
good
thing
ya
man
this
beer
is
good
stuff
recommended
o
very
good
one
of
my
top
3
jp
beer
i
revisit
frequently
i
keep
meaning
to
set
one
away
for
a
couple
years
to
see
how
it
develops
this
beer
might
have
turned
my
opinion
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
red
w
minimal
head
lacing
or
carbonation
smell
is
that
of
fruit
rum
yeast
and
a
little
funk
really
opens
up
and
smooths
out
over
ten
minutes
the
taste
followed
the
nose
but
was
a
little
tart
at
first
then
something
amazing
happened
the
more
i
let
it
air
out
and
breathe
the
more
the
beer
smoothed
out
and
came
to
life
by
the
end
i
was
saying
holy
crap
i
really
like
this
beer
very
complex
in
every
category
and
very
enjoyabledrinkable
highly
recommended
for
the
style
i
must
drink
this
rather
slowly
because
it
puckers
the
lips
so
nonetheless
extremely
unique
and
quite
nice
i
like
a
real
cherry
flavor
in
beer
overall
a
great
sour
beer
and
one
that
ill
have
again
and
again
overall
bright
lively
and
fresh
a
fine
addition
to
the
wild
ale
category
pricey
a
great
dinner
beer
this
beer
pours
a
deep
reddish
color
with
a
good
hazyness
and
a
decent
off
white
head
the
smell
is
slightly
acetic
a
little
vinegary
and
pleasantly
funky
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
only
a
slight
vinegar
taste
more
tartness
and
that
tooth
stripping
feel
definitely
a
funky
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
definitely
one
of
the
most
overlooked
american
wild
producers
overall
this
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
brew
o
had
to
get
this
while
i
was
out
of
state
i
am
overall
impressed
by
the
brewery
with
the
sour
styling
overall
that
is
a
tasty
beverage
jolly
pumpkin
continues
to
impress
this
beer
reminds
me
off
the
apple
orchard
as
a
kid
which
reminds
me
i
should
do
that
this
fall
it
has
been
too
long
overall
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
fun
and
complex
without
making
me
want
to
switch
to
another
beer
afterwards
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
body
is
as
good
as
any
wild
ale
ive
had
right
up
there
with
rr
for
quality
only
this
one
i
can
actually
find
locally
and
at
a
decent
price
great
job
this
beer
is
the
shit
o
not
a
bad
flanders
red
just
not
the
best
this
beer
was
poured
and
paired
with
raspberry
point
oysters
first
time
having
oysters
because
i
typically
dont
care
for
seafood
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
fruity
and
funky
it
looked
red
in
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
lacing
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
tart
and
had
plenty
of
sour
qualities
to
it
the
beer
pairs
really
well
with
the
oysters
because
they
was
a
lots
of
black
pepper
in
them
the
sour
and
pepper
balanced
each
other
out
really
well
the
mouthfeel
is
the
beer
had
a
good
carbonation
to
it
its
light
bodied
and
kind
of
refreshing
overall
its
a
good
wild
ale
in
my
opinion
worth
trying
for
sure
would
have
liked
to
split
the
big
bottle
o
a
decent
wild
ale
that
i
wish
had
a
bit
more
depth
of
flavor
and
body
it
not
bad
by
any
means
but
is
far
from
great
o
what
can
i
say
i
love
jolly
pumpkin
they
do
these
funky
barrel
aged
wilds
so
well
this
stuff
is
very
easy
to
find
and
well
priced
for
a
wild
ale
this
is
very
approachable
since
it
isnt
really
sour
but
still
has
tons
of
complexity
to
keep
everyone
interested
anyone
who
enjoys
this
style
owes
it
to
themselves
to
check
this
out
o
very
nice
beer
good
level
of
sourtartness
without
being
overpouring
good
flavor
decent
complexity
although
not
amazing
carbonation
faded
too
quickly
for
me
didnt
seem
to
be
as
carbonated
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
and
definitely
faded
quicker
over
all
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
with
out
question
as
with
most
wilds
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
la
roja
is
most
definitely
a
flandersstyle
sour
oaky
and
fruity
and
funky
and
its
tart
with
slightly
sour
fruit
popping
up
throughout
but
it
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
tongue
with
puckering
vinegar
and
it
doesnt
try
to
emulate
the
horde
of
brews
that
have
recently
taken
a
shot
at
this
style
its
complex
and
layered
tasty
and
drinkable
looking
out
for
the
grand
reserve
j
d
overall
kinda
a
dissapointment
not
blown
away
like
i
have
been
by
many
sours
in
the
past
this
one
could
use
some
tweaks
to
further
emphasize
some
flavors
o
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
not
overly
sourtart
and
had
a
really
nice
fruit
flavor
to
it
look
forward
to
getting
this
one
again
for
sure
drinkability
despite
the
alcohol
showing
up
its
still
very
drinkable
not
too
dry
of
a
finish
but
it
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
amazing
o
i
love
the
batch
variation
of
this
beer
even
more
so
than
with
other
jp
beers
this
is
my
absolute
favorite
version
the
strong
bourbon
character
adds
so
much
to
the
beer
just
wonderful
o
subtle
but
complex
and
perfectly
balanced
la
roja
proves
a
great
beer
to
contemplate
on
a
beautiful
evening
in
early
summer
it
was
great
to
try
an
aged
bottle
of
this
beer
very
complex
after
reviewing
the
rest
of
the
glass
went
quite
well
with
some
gamey
duck
pate
d
nice
carbonation
sticks
to
the
mouth
but
very
easy
to
drink
o
wow
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
great
flavor
profile
that
is
an
interesting
combination
that
hangs
together
well
have
heard
mixed
reviews
from
friends
so
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
heading
to
the
store
tonight
to
see
whether
any
remains
o
not
recommended
im
not
buying
this
again
25
definitely
good
but
not
my
favorite
flanders
red
the
oak
character
comes
on
a
bit
strong
for
my
tastes
but
on
the
whole
i
enjoy
it
yum
tonight
i
need
something
to
kind
of
wake
me
up
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
bottle
of
la
roja
hiding
out
in
my
fridge
whats
more
its
the
inaugural
vintage
from
3
years
ago
as
the
label
simply
states
blend
1
2008
guess
its
been
there
for
awhile
pours
a
murky
blood
orange
red
with
no
head
aroma
is
of
oaked
funk
bring
on
the
sour
im
guessing
this
is
a
take
on
a
flanders
red
given
the
aroma
and
appearance
first
taste
is
sour
but
not
overpowering
tart
cherry
hits
the
sides
of
the
tongue
before
being
washed
away
by
earthy
funk
in
the
finish
the
taste
is
wild
but
at
the
same
time
its
very
restrained
the
oak
helps
keep
things
in
line
and
the
lengthy
aging
process
has
added
a
nice
sherry
complexity
to
things
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
that
helps
to
brighten
things
up
and
scrub
the
palate
as
you
continue
to
drink
it
ive
had
a
number
of
sour
beers
and
this
one
is
among
the
most
well
rounded
by
that
i
mean
its
not
unnervingly
sour
its
an
evenly
crafted
beer
from
start
to
finish
speaking
of
the
finish
its
dry
perhaps
as
to
be
expected
which
means
that
you
keep
going
back
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
a
refreshing
diversion
and
a
must
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
sour
or
wild
ales
if
you
happen
to
run
across
it
id
recommend
cellaring
it
for
a
couple
of
years
and
busting
it
out
you
wont
regret
it
o
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
make
sure
to
open
this
one
over
the
sink
its
a
gusher
another
great
selection
from
jp
and
i
would
love
to
try
the
grande
reserve
overall
this
is
a
solid
flanders
style
beer
nice
barrel
aging
with
a
decent
level
of
sour
acidity
and
fruitiness
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
and
see
it
then
its
worth
checking
out
overall
solid
beer
i
like
it
and
for
the
10
pricetag
possibly
my
favorite
in
terms
of
value
not
comparible
to
the
best
i
have
had
but
certainly
worthwhile
despite
the
carbonation
flaw
this
is
a
very
foodfriendly
beer
its
not
vinegary
but
its
a
nice
amount
of
fruity
sour
o
really
solid
american
wild
i
enjoy
that
every
flavor
has
its
place
and
in
the
end
its
very
smooth
the
dry
pucker
at
the
end
is
very
nice
and
the
sourness
never
overtakes
the
subtle
fruit
flavors
would
drink
again
no
doubt
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
bubbly
with
a
medium
body
feel
finishes
with
a
slight
astringency
overall
a
very
enjoyable
wild
ale
not
quite
as
sour
as
a
true
belgian
flanders
gueuze
or
lambic
but
still
pleasant
nonetheless
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
so
many
times
one
of
my
favs
but
im
glad
i
didnt
wait
any
longer
on
this
bottle
o
ive
tried
this
beer
on
a
couple
previous
occasions
and
found
a
solid
if
not
overly
remarkable
sour
amber
oud
bruin
this
time
its
pretty
close
to
wow
inducing
great
depth
of
flavor
and
gorgeous
mouthfeel
ill
have
to
pick
up
more
as
la
roja
is
available
currently
in
oregon
and
remember
to
sock
it
away
a
couple
years
minimum
well
done
jolly
pumpkin
taste
is
where
this
one
shines
slightly
astringent
sourness
apple
rind
on
top
of
an
almost
ripe
mango
woody
earth
and
a
very
slight
wet
hay
almost
champaign
like
in
the
feel
but
with
a
slight
creaminess
a
very
complex
and
refreshing
take
on
a
style
that
knows
wide
variation
bravo
pours
a
nice
burgandy
color
with
white
head
smells
of
fruit
and
brett
very
pleasant
and
inviting
nice
fruit
flavor
not
sure
which
berry
but
slightly
tart
and
refreshing
slight
hint
of
sourness
and
funk
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
light
bodied
very
champagnelike
this
is
a
very
good
brew
its
simple
and
subtle
which
is
usually
not
common
for
the
style
but
is
a
nice
change
for
when
you
want
something
that
is
just
slightly
wild
and
has
a
nice
fruit
backbone
o
a
nice
sipping
beer
with
a
refreshing
tartness
plays
nice
with
a
huge
swath
of
food
pairings
from
red
curry
to
caprese
salad
to
earth
cheeses
i
liked
it
but
have
certainly
had
better
wild
ales
tasty
offering
great
for
lovers
of
anything
sour
overall
a
nice
effort
this
being
my
first
flandersstyle
ale
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
personally
i
think
it
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
body
but
im
not
sure
if
that
would
be
out
of
character
for
a
flanders
i
do
know
that
it
tasted
great
with
my
turkey
meatloaf
one
of
the
most
under
rated
sours
on
the
market
la
roja
posses
an
excellent
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
the
sourtartness
is
well
balanced
with
the
woody
flavors
hints
of
raspberries
and
mellow
cherry
excellent
brewing
on
this
one
i
bet
with
some
age
this
beer
will
drink
a
lot
better
la
roja
is
a
beer
i
will
always
have
in
my
cellar
and
fridge
poured
from
750
to
a
stemless
wine
class
pours
a
hzy
copper
red
with
a
thin
white
head
with
great
lacing
sour
cherry
nose
slightly
bready
flavor
is
a
blast
of
slighty
watered
down
frut
punch
some
funk
and
not
much
else
a
little
tart
a
little
residual
bitterness
a
little
and
not
too
complex
as
it
warms
it
gain
some
compexity
in
the
flavor
but
really
just
stronger
flavors
that
are
more
of
the
same
above
overall
very
drinkable
but
a
little
boring
for
a
wild
ale
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
am
glad
i
was
able
to
find
it
however
and
it
could
just
be
due
to
my
recent
sour
phase
but
this
could
be
a
little
more
sour
for
my
liking
as
most
people
have
said
it
would
be
a
great
intro
beer
into
the
style
would
i
drink
it
again
definitely
would
i
buy
it
again
eh
probably
go
with
a
sure
fire
rr
like
consecration
o
this
is
a
pretty
complex
brew
there
is
impressive
balance
considering
everything
going
on
here
definitely
enjoy
this
bold
beer
a
lot
would
be
a
good
intro
sour
that
still
packs
a
lot
of
shockfactor
d
a
nice
wild
ale
that
is
easily
drinkable
a
great
one
to
start
with
or
to
come
back
to
as
one
of
my
first
sour
beers
this
is
a
great
place
to
start
its
not
nearly
as
acidic
or
lactic
as
other
sours
on
the
market
its
tame
but
approachable
justifiable
so
a
wonderful
introduction
to
the
style
o
what
a
fun
new
category
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
id
like
to
rank
it
higher
and
would
if
this
bottle
resulted
in
some
headlacing
others
do
just
unfortunately
mine
did
not
this
glass
drinks
well
enough
and
ill
be
able
to
finish
the
entire
750ml
bottle
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
this
beer
again
its
a
little
too
strong
to
drink
a
lot
of
and
not
quite
as
sour
as
id
like
it
to
be
there
are
better
american
wild
ales
out
there
but
this
one
shouldnt
be
passed
up
especially
by
someone
new
to
the
style
d
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
brew
and
def
a
repeat
drink
overall
very
decent
for
not
being
a
traditional
flanders
red
or
sour
very
good
intro
to
sours
the
st
arnolds
lawnmower
of
sours
in
my
opinion
worth
trying
this
seems
like
it
would
be
a
nice
opening
beer
for
someone
looking
to
get
into
sours
very
restrained
yet
still
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
that
might
ease
someone
into
the
sourwild
world
definitely
a
beer
that
is
best
enjoyed
with
multiple
glasses
over
a
longer
period
of
time
to
get
the
full
feel
for
it
d
this
bottle
was
easy
to
finish
enjoyable
as
any
jolly
pumpkin
that
i
have
tried
this
is
a
seriously
underrated
brewery
pumping
out
almost
exclusively
american
wild
ales
check
this
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
drinkability
this
was
my
first
american
wild
ale
style
and
i
greatly
enjoyed
it
it
also
went
down
like
nectar
sweet
but
great
attributes
all
along
the
way
hope
to
have
anything
else
from
this
artisan
ale
company
again
im
not
very
well
versed
in
sours
and
was
excited
to
find
this
unexpectedly
around
here
at
13
a
bottle
i
wont
have
it
often
but
i
do
enjoy
it
not
a
difficult
drinker
di
was
very
surprised
and
excited
about
the
aroma
probably
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
the
flavor
was
ok
but
it
doesnt
have
any
really
strong
back
bone
all
of
the
different
elements
are
interesting
but
nothing
takes
the
lead
to
tie
it
all
together
so
it
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
mess
i
have
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
and
i
was
so
happy
with
bam
bier
but
this
was
a
little
disappointing
i
finished
the
bottle
but
i
dont
see
myself
ever
buying
this
again
d
really
easy
to
drink
reminds
me
of
just
a
slighter
weaker
russian
river
sourwild
but
im
very
impressed
since
this
is
the
first
jolly
pumpkin
brew
ive
had
nice
smell
and
taste
that
make
me
wish
i
had
more
im
suprised
that
no
one
had
bought
this
before
me
and
let
it
sit
on
the
shelf
that
long
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
will
seek
more
overall
a
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
jolly
pumpkin
excels
at
offering
beers
that
go
beyond
beer
like
other
flanders
ales
it
has
more
sour
fruit
is
dry
and
tastes
like
cider
or
wine
rather
than
beer
the
earth
notes
are
a
pleasant
addition
that
add
some
grit
into
the
beer
it
becomes
a
little
less
sour
as
it
warms
but
it
still
keeps
complex
flavors
d
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
wasnt
sure
if
i
would
enjoy
this
being
it
was
my
first
taste
in
the
world
of
sours
but
i
enjoyed
and
cant
wait
until
i
can
venture
farther
into
the
world
of
sour
verdict
after
being
slightly
let
down
by
the
la
parcela
not
tasting
like
pumpkin
i
was
happy
that
this
brew
tasted
as
it
was
advertised
an
amber
ale
a
very
good
blend
of
dark
fruits
and
spices
not
too
complex
and
not
too
shallow
quite
unique
and
easily
drinkable
blend
14
from
2009
it
poured
a
murky
burgundy
to
plum
in
color
a
one
finger
creme
colored
head
it
aromas
consist
of
a
dry
dark
fruitcider
like
sourness
it
could
be
tart
cherries
thats
probably
the
closest
fruit
id
relate
it
to
im
a
fan
it
made
the
others
in
the
room
pucker
the
flavors
are
very
funky
and
very
tart
it
has
a
lot
of
cherry
and
a
lot
of
granny
smith
apple
to
it
it
drinks
very
crisp
with
an
excellent
tart
bite
this
is
a
fine
sour
this
beer
is
drinkable
all
things
considered
its
more
tart
and
more
sour
than
most
man
what
a
ride
like
i
said
theres
so
much
to
be
gotten
from
this
such
an
interesting
taste
it
was
really
a
pleasure
just
experiencing
all
the
different
movements
ones
probably
good
for
me
at
a
time
dont
know
if
this
ones
a
repeat
performer
in
a
sitting
id
definitely
have
it
again
sometime
though
blend
142009
d
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
sour
nice
balance
between
sour
and
funk
doesnt
feel
like
7
2
abv
worth
the
money
to
try
definitely
if
you
enjoy
flanders
red
ales
reviewed
from
notes
amber
red
in
color
very
pretty
beer
minimal
headlacing
smells
sour
with
vinegar
and
wood
notes
tastes
sour
with
caramel
and
wood
notes
not
a
ton
of
differentiation
between

and

very
very
drinkable
moderate
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
wasnt
my
favorite
wild
ale
for
the
price
i
believe
this
is
the
2nd
jolly
pumpkin
that
ive
had
and
ive
enjoyed
both
as
they
tend
to
take
me
outside
of
my
norm
of
stouts
and
ipas
good
stuff
good
offering
im
glad
to
finally
tick
this
one
off
ive
been
a
fool
to
send
this
out
so
often
and
never
truly
enjoy
one
myself
it
is
the
beginners
sour
beer
in
my
opinion
i
think
i
may
finish
this
750
all
by
myself
that
seven
percent
alcohol
never
jumps
in
my
way
or
comes
forth
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
reddishlightbrown
color
with
a
medium
white
head
scent
is
definitely
sour
funk
with
some
strong
cherry
aromas
also
get
some
oak
notes
along
with
a
hint
of
brandy
love
the
way
this
beer
smells
taste
is
initially
grassy
with
oak
flavors
slight
sweet
vanilla
with
intense
sour
cherry
flavors
finishes
with
fairly
strong
brett
flavors
oak
and
brandy
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
with
a
creamy
finish
drinkability
is
fairly
high
mouthfeel
is
average
maybe
a
bit
to
much
carbonation
i
nursed
a
glass
for
the
better
part
of
an
afternoon
and
got
a
little
bored
with
the
flavor
i
need
a
certain
amount
of
fruit
to
come
through
for
me
to
really
enjoy
a
sour
or
wild
ale
d
i
thought
this
one
was
a
decent
middle
of
the
road
flanders
style
good
for
sure
id
have
it
again
d
this
is
along
the
lines
of
a
flemish
red
but
much
drier
i
am
definitely
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
and
im
sure
any
fan
of
sours
will
also
appreciate
it
d
horrible
for
my
tastes
i
understand
its
supposed
to
be
sour
but
this
is
horribly
off
tasting
i
really
had
no
idea
what
i
was
getting
into
with
his
beer
just
heard
about
them
and
someone
at
the
local
whole
foods
recomended
this
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
will
be
getting
it
again
and
will
be
trying
other
beers
by
jolly
pumpking
despite
the
beers
being
on
the
outer
ranges
of
what
i
am
pushing
as
far
as
prices
if
you
see
this
buy
it
truly
exceptional
d
nice
actually
after
you
get
over
the
initial
puckering
sourness
it
goes
down
very
easily
very
flavorful
and
did
not
disappoint
id
pick
this
up
again
fairly
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
very
drinkable
each
sip
leaves
a
pleasant
flavor
on
your
palate
that
lingers
for
quite
a
well
the
7
2
abv
will
help
keep
me
warm
but
doesnt
play
a
role
in
the
taste
or
drinkability
at
all
a
great
intro
to
american
wild
ales
d
not
over
the
top
in
abv
but
after
a
bomber
you
might
want
more
though
it
possibly
would
not
be
wise
overall
a
decent
sour
worth
a
shot
not
a
beginners
sour
however
im
more
than
half
way
through
the
bomber
and
dont
feel
like
stopping
yet
d
i
could
not
finish
the
bottle
this
beer
was
just
overwhelmingly
sour
but
i
will
say
it
did
pair
up
fairly
well
some
tortellini
and
red
sauce
for
dinner
and
it
might
be
intended
to
be
this
sour
so
while
it
might
not
be
for
me
its
still
a
well
made
ale
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
who
knows
it
was
like
a
watered
down
supplication
with
rotted
wood
and
sweaty
musty
sock
juice
poured
in
no
thanks
poured
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
head
which
had
great
retention
and
left
some
bubbly
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
made
it
seem
like
it
would
be
tart
in
flavor
that
consisted
of
slight
vinegar
cherries
funky
oaky
and
mild
acidic
notes
it
did
have
some
lemon
character
as
well
the
flavor
reminded
me
more
of
a
flanders
red
but
funkier
the
cherries
were
more
potent
on
the
palate
with
oaky
funky
and
slight
vinegar
accents
with
acidic
tart
lemony
notes
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
fruity
acidic
citrusy
oaky
funky
tart
and
tingly
finish
it
drank
great
and
reminded
me
how
tarty
this
brew
was
i
definitely
need
to
pick
up
some
bottles
of
this
in
the
near
future
taste
sour
but
not
puckering
tastes
a
lot
like
the
drie
fonteinen
doesjel
bottling
which
was
an
unblended
aged
lambic
very
smooth
not
sweet
like
other
flanders
reds
this
is
oddly
dry
i
like
it
7
2
alc
is
not
noticeable
this
is
an
artisan
amber
ale
aged
in
oak
barrels
blended
from
barrels
ranging
to
over
a
year
in
age
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
country
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
beer
so
far
o
some
of
the
flavors
need
more
time
to
mellow
out
including
the
bitterness
i
appreciate
the
dryness
many
in
this
style
are
undrinkably
sweet
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
would
have
liked
it
somewhat
cleaner
d
overall
theres
funk
and
then
theres
funk
this
one
is
just
a
bit
ot
far
off
the
funk
rails
for
my
tastes
pours
a
hazed
copper
color
thin
cap
of
head
minimal
retention
scent
is
mild
and
contains
notes
of
sweet
caramel
bready
yeasts
citrusy
hops
damp
earth
and
wood
taste
brings
the
damp
funkyness
to
the
front
tastes
of
yeasty
bread
red
wine
apple
vinegar
followed
up
by
some
caramel
and
citrus
quite
mixed
and
muddled
flavor
but
i
think
that
was
the
goal
with
this
one
medium
bodied
dry
finish
an
interesting
beer
with
many
things
going
on
at
once
with
neither
standing
out
too
much
d
quite
high
with
lower
abv
and
great
not
too
intense
sour
flavors
dark
amberbrown
with
offwhite
head
sitting
on
top
aroma
of
citrus
notes
sourness
and
lemon
zest
sour
flavors
lemons
spiked
apple
cider
thanks
grandma
and
some
candy
the
spritzy
body
bites
the
palate
and
accentuates
the
flavors
a
very
refreshing
lively
pleasant
drink
pours
a
fairly
clear
garnet
with
a
heavy
sud
atop
lacing
is
thick
and
plentiful
as
with
the
best
jolly
pumpkin
bottles
the
nose
is
rich
integrated
with
a
wholesome
wallop
of
oak
and
brett
cherries
and
red
wine
barrel
really
come
out
here
wet
wood
bugs
i
have
found
that
in
the
past
34
years
jolly
pumpkin
stuff
has
tended
to
become
on
the
bland
side
for
some
reason
whether
its
less
time
in
the
oak
less
attention
from
the
brewer
or
what
have
you
i
think
this
would
have
been
fairly
nondescript
fresh
but
2
years
is
a
nice
age
here
mouth
is
fairly
expressive
with
sour
cherries
green
apple
oak
of
course
brett
green
apple
is
very
welcome
and
is
quite
strong
a
strange
bit
of
mint
on
the
finish
thats
kind
of
distracting
medium
carbonation
good
amount
soft
feel
this
isnt
the
best
bottle
of
la
roja
ive
had
but
its
among
the
better
ones
d
the
sour
is
good
but
its
incredibly
dry
and
becoming
a
chore
to
drink
the
more
i
have
it
a
moderate
wild
but
a
little
moldylike
as
always
jolly
pumpkin
had
made
an
insanely
drinkable
balanced
brew
light
cherry
tartness
chewy
wood
characteristics
light
malt
sweetness
light
applelike
acidity
horse
blanket
funk
in
the
nose
pretty
chewy
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
no
abv
to
be
found
really
nice
d
very
nice
worth
a
pickup
maybe
even
two
or
three
split
a
bottle
with
a
friend
some
sours
can
pack
so
much
tangy
punch
it
can
be
hard
to
split
a
750ml
bottle
but
this
had
nice
slightly
restrained
character
the
opening
earthy
barnyard
character
is
subtle
and
not
so
overpowering
like
an
old
stinky
gueuze
its
followed
by
tart
lemon
and
sour
cherries
it
doesnt
come
off
as
the
most
complex
sour
though
maybe
a
year
or
two
in
a
cellar
would
change
that
but
its
pleasantly
sour
while
remaining
relatively
drinkable
and
i
appreciate
that
pours
a
hazy
deep
brown
color
with
a
ruddy
hue
there
is
a
think
tan
head
that
recedes
quickly
and
leaves
only
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
funky
and
pretty
tart
with
notes
of
tart
cherries
and
sweet
malt
dominating
a
little
aroma
of
wet
wood
is
also
present
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
mild
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
but
still
very
nice
there
is
a
light
tartness
and
signature
jp
funk
mixed
with
some
lightly
sweet
and
tart
cherries
and
damp
wood
the
body
is
middleoftheroad
with
carbonation
on
the
light
side
pretty
drinkable
stuff
but
not
as
funky
as
i
would
expect
from
a
4
year
old
jp
beer
d
tasty
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
though
more
boozy
than
a
7
that
feels
light
should
be
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
d
this
drinks
really
well
for
a
wild
ale
perhaps
due
in
part
to
its
lack
of
a
mouth
puckering
sourness
i
had
no
problem
polishing
off
the
bottle
on
my
own
over
the
course
of
about
2
hours
12750
ml
is
a
decent
price
for
a
wild
ale
these
days
too
highly
recommended
d
just
a
great
an
intriguing
beer
fits
the
style
well
for
sure
simply
a
great
beer
to
get
your
sour
fix
maybe
it
is
just
this
particular
batch
but
was
surprised
at
how
low
most
of
the
ratings
are
based
upon
what
is
in
my
glass
in
front
of
me
split
from
a
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
wine
glass
poured
a
murky
red
redorange
with
a
minimal
white
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
sour
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sour
malt
raspberries
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
wild
ale
had
a
mellow
flavor
that
made
it
quite
enjoyable
also
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
quite
nice
as
well
this
one
is
a
must
try
for
any
wild
ale
fan
if
you
get
the
chance
this
beer
pours
with
a
deep
reddish
color
the
ivory
foam
holds
for
just
a
minutes
and
then
leaves
some
ok
lacing
the
aroma
instantly
reveals
what
jolly
pumpkin
does
best
sour
heavy
scents
of
sour
apple
and
wild
yeasts
as
well
as
hints
of
oak
the
flavor
is
exactly
what
you
expect
from
the
smell
heavy
sour
notes
hit
you
right
up
front
with
a
dry
oaky
finish
this
beer
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
sour
ale
but
know
what
youre
getting
into
when
pouring
this
beverage
this
bottle
was
a
gusher
but
the
three
people
who
tried
it
still
thought
everything
was
pretty
good
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
batch
though
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
refreshing
i
dig
sour
beer
but
the
prospect
of
drinking
a
whole
large
format
bottle
of
it
can
at
times
seem
a
bit
of
a
quagmire
however
i
will
finish
this
one
off
by
myself
quite
easily
owhat
an
awesome
start
to
this
bif
a
sour
with
plenty
of
room
left
for
flavor
lactic
but
not
vinegary
d
a
bomber
is
easy
to
put
away
this
beer
is
light
with
excellent
flavro
and
aroma
perfect
for
multiple
drinks
oh
ill
finish
this
big
ass
bottle
by
myself
but
i
must
say
this
is
one
tart
beer
its
like
touching
your
tongue
to
a
9v
battery
d
i
used
to
love
this
when
i
was
new
to
sours
but
after
a
couple
of
years
of
exploring
the
style
i
cant
honestly
put
this
on
the
same
pedestal
as
russian
river
its
not
terrible
but
its
closer
to
middle
of
the
pack
than
uppertier
quite
a
good
value
though
cheers
md
this
ale
has
shown
a
decent
ageing
potential
id
say
the
flavour
profile
is
quite
balanced
the
body
is
mediumplus
and
the
carbonation
is
very
healthy
indeed
for
this
batchblend
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
likeable
oakyfunky
ale
it
has
an
ok
drinkability
nothing
special
but
for
a
wild
at
7
its
fairly
drinkable
some
of
the
flemmy
taste
gives
it
a
tougher
swallow
and
a
very
light
warming
booze
with
the
sour
and
tart
fruits
but
for
what
it
is
its
fairly
drinkable
worth
a
try
very
approachable
drinkable
sour
could
have
many
of
these
but
i
wish
some
of
the
flavors
werent
so
faint
cheers
yeah
a
tasty
refreshing
beer
if
it
had
more
character
this
would
be
sensational
but
its
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
better
cold
than
at
room
temperature
its
quite
bretty
in
the
mouth
mild
tartness
sourness
is
moderate
there
is
some
sweetness
to
it
up
front
but
mostly
this
is
a
brett
bomb
overall
its
pretty
good
for
a
wild
i
wouldnt
really
describe
this
beer
as
overly
fruity
or
sour
if
i
want
a
sour
made
with
cherries
i
think
ill
go
for
a
supplication
although
this
can
be
a
bit
too
acidic
its
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
its
fun
to
seek
out
all
of
the
unusual
flavors
it
would
have
received
an
even
better
review
if
it
hadnt
been
enjoyed
in
such
close
proximity
to
several
glasses
of
consecration
d
boy
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
very
tasty
nicely
sour
nice
oak
this
is
a
really
great
beer
its
a
nice
enough
beer
but
its
a
little
bit
too
acidic
and
intense
without
the
complexity
to
make
it
really
exceptional
ive
had
better
wilds
and
better
beers
from
jolly
pumpkin
still
its
hard
not
to
respect
it
d
meh
some
flavor
but
after
having
la
folie
leaves
me
a
bit
wanting
it
seems
other
pumpkin
offerings
have
more
going
on
i
enjoyed
this
brew
today
but
ive
had
much
better
beer
from
jolly
pumpkins
before
they
are
in
the
top
20
of
my
favorite
brewers
in
the
usa
great
big
head
pretty
hazy

herbal
light
yeast
and
granny
smith
apples
long
finish
with
a
medium
body
dry
texture
and
lively
carbonation
can
really
taste
the
oak
which
gets
more
intense
at
the
finish
lingers
pours
a
semitransparent
ruby
color
with
good
off
white

good

and

sour

taste
is
much
the

with

sour
but
still
on
the
moderate
side
lite

thats
a
bit
chalky
and
sour
in
the
finish
average

still
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
a

carbonation
is
also
above
average
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
a
lot
of
great

it
it
was
pretty
well
balanced

the
tart
and
sour
flavors
and
the
sweet
fruity
flavors
which
definitely
helped
the
drinkability
very
good
beer
overall
overall
very
impressed
with
this
one
when
colder
exhibits
the
refreshing
goodness
of
a
rodenbach
or
an
oude
tart
as
it
warms
much
more
of
the
funky
horseblanket
starts
coming
through
and
delivering
an
uncanny
yet
pleasant
experience
i
can
see
why
wild
ales
are
an
acquired
taste
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
bottle
the
flavors
were
pretty
off
putting
at
first
but
improved
a
bit
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
bottle
even
still
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
beer
or
even
this
style
anytime
soon
very
solid
beer
not
spectacular
needs
to
be
more
sour
for
me
but
i
cant
deny
that
it
does
a
lot
of
things
very
well
i
think
it
objectively
a
good
beer
even
if
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
man
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
deep
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lace
soft
caramel
and
a
savory
maple
syrup
like
pancakes
with
bacon
and
syrup
scent
hit
me
first
followed
by
funk
and
vinegar
and
wrapped
up
with
wood
and
musty
earthy
fruitiness
the
wild
and
sour
sides
come
out
a
lot
as
it
warms
taste
is
all
of
the
above
and
it
seems
to
have
a
peaty
almost
whiskeyish
note
in
the
finish
i
know
its
barrel
aged
but
is
it
bourbon
barrel
aged
just
a
little
too
hot
for
me
but
interesting
complex
and
well
made
the
scent
is
sweet
and
sour
with
grapes
apple
cider
and
balsamic
vinegar
and
just
a
suggestion
of
acidity
that
clears
the
nose
a
bit
initially
the
flavor
is
a
tart
fruitiness
berries
and
apple
cider
that
transforms
to
a
sour
lemon
tart
with
a
burst
of
citric
acidity
there
is
a
definite
woody
character
from
the
barrels
that
settles
in
over
the
course
of
the
experience
as
well
not
upfront
not
intense
more
of
a
rounded
flavor
there
is
decent
but
understated
carbonation
and
a
lightmedium
body
that
is
maybe
just
a
touch
on
the
watery
side
the
carbonation
is
ample
and
these
guys
seem
to
have
taken
a
note
from
the
belgians
on
how
to
utilize
the
proteins
in
the
beer
and
make
bacteria
do
its
thing
in
adding
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
only
wish
they
knew
how
to
mask
the
alcohol
a
little
better
as
it
detracts
from
the
other
flavors
this
is
a
very
authentictasting
flanders
red
well
played
jolly
pumpkin
all
told
i
and
the
wiv
have
been
really
pleased
with
what
weve
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
from
jolly
pumpkin
we
ate
it
with
rachel
rays
super
sloppy
joes
which
was
a
bad
pairing
but
it
seems
like
it
would
be
good
with
a
salmon
or
a
spicy
dish
which
is
to
say
not
a
sweet
dish
although
it
isnt
a
lambic
the
gold
standard
of
sour
ales
it
is
quite
a
pleasing
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
as
have
been
all
of
their
beer
ive
tried
thus
far
we
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
from
them
d
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
lately
it
solves
the
beers
my
girlfriend
would
like
conundrum
very
easily
as
an
added
bonus
the
alcohol
content
is
not
outrageously
high
of
course
its
not
exactly
cheap
but
definitely
worth
the
money
spent
pours
a
dirty
amber
brown
with
a
explosive
foam
nose
is
oak
yeast
chalk
apples
and
cherries
taste
is
very
pleasant
part
1
is
a
solid
tartness
510
on
the
puckermeter
next
is
apples
cherries
and
other
dark
fruits
finishes
with
a
nice
smooth
yeasty
swirl
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
it
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
i
could
imagine
actually
finishing
a
bomber
by
myself
this
bottle
is
labeled
on
the
back
with
blend
3
2008
poured
into
a
snifter
leaves
pretty
decnet
lacing
down
the
glass
the
appearance
is
a
dark
orangish
brown
with
a
big
very
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
yeastybread
sourness
zesty
spices
a
bit
of
sweetness
almost
like
vanilla
probably
from
the
oak
i
can
also
pick
up
some
oak
once
it
starts
to
warm
up
and
an
array
of
fruits
the
taste
is
has
some
of
the
same
attributes
tart
and
sour
spices
bready
some
kinds
of
fruits
im
not
sure
what
kinds
but
they
are
there
kind
of
zesty
lemon
stands
out
but
i
know
there
is
more
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
and
the
alcohol
is
not
there
at
all
pretty
drinkable
kind
of
sour
but
its
not
terribly
bad
ive
been
curious
about
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
am
happy
i
finally
opened
it
up
pretty
good
overall
id
pick
it
up
again
especially
if
it
was
fresh
so
i
could
taste
it
to
compare
im
still
not
good
with
the
subtleties
of
sours
though
this
brew
is
light
on
the
wood
which
i
prefer
its
a
good
evening
drink
after
a
day
in
the
low
90s
but
while
the
sour
aspects
of
this
type
of
wild
is
nice
im
still
looking
for
more
funky
musty
barnyard
american
brews
overall
a
nicely
balanced
wild
ale
that
showcases
some
really
nice
tart
flavors
but
also
has
really
nice
balance
the
hop
notes
did
seem
a
bit
much
for
this
type
of
beer
at
points
but
it
mostly
worked
as
a
positive
to
let
the
sour
notes
shine
definitely
recommended
flavor
is
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
this
is
one
beer
i
can
tell
will
only
get
better
with
age
brett
will
do
this
beer
wonders
by
the
way
this
perticular
beer
was
bottled
in
april
of
this
year2
months
ago
tart
and
funk
elements
are
very
faint
oak
and
earthy
theres
an
odd
bland
aspect
about
halfway
through
the
flavor
starts
decent
blands
out
and
then
finishes
tart
and
dry
the
late
aftertaste
is
the
best
part
slight
lemon
and
cirtus
carbonation
is
relatively
weak
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
once
again
i
feel
this
beer
needs
age
will
definitely
revisit
d
not
mouth
puckering
sour
but
has
a
nice
bite
really
good
flavor
and
very
crisp
with
some
good
pronounced
flavors
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
other
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
i
poured
from
my
750ml
bottle
into
my
glass
and
got
a
thin
off
white
head
it
is
dark
amber
to
copper
in
color
the
aroma
is
green
apple
and
some
tart
cherry
the
taste
is
sourtart
fruit
focusing
on
cherries
its
sweet
for
a
split
second
before
the
sourness
kicks
in
it
finishes
with
a
mustymoldy
taste
the
cherry
taste
really
sticks
to
my
lips
it
has
a
growing
welcoming
affect
on
me
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
want
of
it
the
tartness
seems
to
overtake
the
musty
taste
as
i
continue
to
drink
this
is
style
that
i
have
very
limited
experience
with
but
i
could
see
it
growing
on
me
conclusion
a
drink
that
goes
quite
well
by
itself
but
paired
with
my
hog
wild
pizza
and
belgian
frites
proves
this
is
a
great
beer
to
accompany
and
stand
up
to
some
heavy
dishes
due
to
price
this
is
now
my
goto
sour
beer
at
the
beer
bistro
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
the
beers
appearance
is
not
too
inviting
but
i
soon
move
past
that
once
smelling
and
tasting
likely
had
a
complex
grain
bill
but
the
hardworking
yeasts
have
made
this
brew
highlyattenuated
and
crisp
with
not
much
residual
sweetness
i
could
see
myself
drinking
la
roja
in
the
winter
or
summer
months
batch

murky
copper
color
much
like
an
apple
cider
but
really
looked
like
an
oude
bruin
musty
aroma
with
sour
green
apple
lots
of
wild
yeast
soured
cherry
green
raison
and
a
faint
nose
of
old
hops
taste
is
semitart
with
more
green
apple
and
lots
of
earthy
red
malt
great
moderate
acidity
that
makes
this
dangerously
drinkable
a
750ml
is
perfect
for
me
a
12oz
just
wouldnt
be
enough
congrats
to
ron
jeffries
and
thanks
for
making
this
readily
available
at
so
many
liquor
stores
d
well
i
could
finish
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
buy
another
in
the
words
of
jim
carrey
eh
ive
had
better
ill
just
stick
with
la
folie
until
i
can
find
something
better
j
fairly
refreshing
drinkability
overall
and
not
over
the
top
in
any
category
of
flavor
maybe
with
time
it
would
get
a
little
more
sour
but
in
my
book
this
beer
is
just
ok
not
sure
if
i
would
pay
the
10
again
or
nto
for
a
bottle
rather
just
trade
for
a
supplication
this
beer
is
difficult
to
review
it
smells
great
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
the
flavor
doesnt
contain
a
single
note
that
turns
me
off
and
some
sips
even
have
bursts
of
really
good
things
yet
in
the
end
i
find
the
flavor
to
be
a
little
lacking
its
a
quality
beer
but
i
cant
really
see
what
recommends
it
over
other
readily
available
wilds
it
does
pique
my
interest
in
other
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
though
had
this
about
two
years
after
the
first
review
im
in
love
with
sours
now
and
was
very
glad
to
pick
this
up
again
tastes
slightly
sour
with
some
good
tart
in
the
finish
good
mouthfeel
and
dark
fruits
coming
through
as
well
really
loved
this
beer
the
second
time
around
fantastic
bottle
from
crown
liquors
6
this
beer
pours
dark
amber
with
minimal
white
head
aroma
is
green
apple
and
vinegar
with
roasted
malt
undertones
taste
is
salty
and
sour
with
white
grapes
green
apples
and
some
bready
malt
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonated
overall
a
very
focused
beer
not
a
lot
of
complexity
going
on
very
precise
another
great
selection
from
jp
and
one
i
hope
to
pick
up
again
soon
d
awesome
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
and
could
have
several
glasses
just
amazing
this
is
nice
and
tart
the
cherries
and
the
sour
really
mesh
well
cannot
wait
to
try
another
jolly
pumpkin
beer
d
very
very
good
i
am
very
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
however
at
11
99
a
bottle
i
will
save
this
one
for
a
once
in
a
while
drink
the
beer
is
very
well
carbonated
for
the
style
and
it
is
nice
and
light
bodied
the
flavors
are
mild
but
well
balanced
there
is
a
nice
dry
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
never
present
overall
an
average
wild
ale
but
nice
for
something
so
accessible
d
decently
blended
beer
goes
down
relatively
well
as
i
am
just
getting
in
to
the
sours
and
wilds
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
ive
had
a
few
others
that
i
may
opt
for
first
before
this
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
high
but
soft
drinkability
is
average
this
goes
down
easy
but
doesnt
really
interest
me
at
all
decent
but
not
worth
the
price
tag
this
one
is
a
lot
better
than
the
first
nice
tart
cherriness
like
before
but
this
time
the
oak
is
really
up
front
with
some
nice
vanilla
d
very
solid
brew
wish
it
had
more
carbonation
to
really
bring
out
those
aromas
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
i
have
just
recently
developed
a
taste
for
sour
beers
and
i
must
say
that
this
beer
has
definately
helped
my
new
found
affection
for
this
style
grow
exponentialy
drinkability
you
ask
off
the
charts
i
loved
every
sip
d
good
flavours
and
not
overly
super
expensive
in
this
style
whats
not
to
like
d
a
fair
wild
ale
just
missing
something
in
the
transition
from
nose
to
mouth
still
quite
refreshing
due
to
lack
of
sourness
and
good
mouthfeel
i
could
certainly
finish
this
bomber
by
myself
very
enjoyable
little
brew
here
i
found
two
more
bottles
of
this
on
a
day
trip
to
michigan
today
so
i
cant
wait
to
let
them
get
some
age
on
em
if
you
like
sours
give
this
one
a
shot
d
bizarre
this
is
certainly
a
unique
beer
its
sort
of
like
a
complex
knot
i
enjoyed
trying
to
untie
it
and
figure
out
where
each
flavor
was
going
and
connected
to
however
it
never
really
forms
a
cohesive
brew
its
a
fun
beer
for
sure
but
just
needs
something
to
tie
it
all
together
a
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
but
will
not
go
back
to
in
particular
in
the
future
but
i
will
be
exploring
jolly
pumpkins
arsenal
mouthfeel
was
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
one
of
the
thicker
mouthfeel
sours
that
i
have
had
probably
with
more
age
this
one
would
have
calmed
down
some
of
its
oak
flavors
i
would
recommend
anyone
with
this
batch
to
hang
onto
it
for
a
little
longer
to
get
some
more
mellowing
a
really
nice
sour
that
does
not
dissapoint
it
reminds
me
in
a
lot
of
ways
of
a
concecration
in
fact
a
lot
of
ways
i
would
love
to
do
a
side
to
side
comparision
lots
of
red
wine
taste
to
this
some
carbination
well
done
and
recommended
a
must
try
drinkability
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
granted
the
other
beers
of
the
style
i
had
were
supplication
and
sanctification
and
thats
a
hard
act
to
follow
but
i
thought
that
there
were
layers
of
complexity
that
just
werent
there
this
is
a
good
beer
this
makes
a
nice
replacement
flemish
sour
since
rodenbach
grand
cru
changed
from
being
an
all
older
ale
beer
which
really
made
it
lose
a
lot
of
the
raw
character
it
originally
had
overall
a
quality
beer
and
its
nice
to
see
how
its
aged
but
i
wouldnt
let
it
sit
inbottle
any
longer
d
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
fairly
mild
for
a
wild
but
it
improved
a
lot
as
it
warmed
letting
the
oak
and
wild
yeast
shine
a
lot
more
a
tasty
brew
drinkability
was
great
nover
overly
tart
sweet
or
bitter
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
tulip
slightly
cloudy
dark
red
almost
brown
topped
with
a
1
finger
brownish
head
lacing
thruout
sour
fruit
aromas
with
earthy
spice
and
yeast
i
taste
sour
fruit
cherry
apple
with
a
little
sweet
caramel
medium
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
am
new
to
sour
ales
but
this
was
good
one
or
two
glasses
would
be
enough
ottle
i
thought
i
already
rated
this
because
i
had
this
so
many
times
and
then
i
realized
i
did
not
enter
my
ratings
and
my
notes
are
not
here
so
now
i
open
my
only
bottle
obtained
this
2
years
ago
in
michigan
pours
just
a
slight
hazed
amber
with
a
thin
beige
cap
nose
of
fruit
apple
plums
cherries
and
lots
of
yeast
with
floral
spices
and
some
rye
bread
with
a
bit
of
booze
flavour
profile
is
full
of
cherries
and
yeast
with
good
rose
petal
floral
hopiness
wood
and
bretty
funk
as
well
i
love
the
finish
of
these
beers
quite
yeasty
and
funky
but
refreshing
and
always
leading
me
to
want
more
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
little
strange
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
not
something
id
be
stocking
up
on
but
the
one
bottle
was
good
and
not
much
of
a
chore
to
get
through
d
most
sours
i
have
a
hard
time
drinking
in
large
quantities
this
one
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
its
not
overly
sour
instead
its
crisp
and
refreshing
dont
drink
and
review
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
style
and
though
i
dont
love
the
flavor
i
am
thankful
for
the
experience
the
flavors
are
pretty
outthere
and
the
high
abv
make
for
a
good
onetime
experience
i
might
pick
it
up
again
if
i
were
hosting
a
tasting
but
definitely
not
to
sit
around
and
drink
serving
type
bottle
what
a
find
here
saw
this
one
at
my
local
liquor
store
and
finally
decided
to
biteim
glad
i
did
pours
a
beautiful
amber
auburn
red
color
with
decent
sandy
head
that
laces
nicely
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
nice
with
some
yeastiness
some
vinegar
and
some
fruit
some
bourbonlike
aromas
toovanilla
oak
and
butter
taste
follows
with
some
real
complexity
i
do
however
recommend
drinking
this
at
nearroom
temperature
as
it
really
opens
up
big
bold
vinegar
apple
yeast
oak
butter
vinegar
must
yeast
and
some
others
that
i
cant
pick
out
robust
but
balanced
at
the
same
time
i
like
it
mf
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
drinkability
is
great
the
bomber
disappeared
way
too
fast
d
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
now
and
again
not
phenomenal
overall
but
still
very
good
notes
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
beer
and
i
liked
it
i
will
need
to
pursue
some
more
oak
aged
beers
i
like
the
flavor
that
it
imparts
to
the
beer
that
is
already
there
that
being
said
this
beer
wasnt
super
impressive
but
still
a
good
beer
drinkability
solid
and
delicious
through
and
through
and
a
style
ill
sip
on
during
the
summer
regularly
if
i
can
ever
afford
it
worth
the
extra
cash
the
bottle
may
be
over
others
this
size
in
the
style
originally
reviewed
on
02082009
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
doesnt
even
come
close
to
the
higher
end
beers
of
the
style
d
drinkablity
is
steller
and
i
will
be
buying
out
the
rest
at
my
local
store
to
celler
and
enjoy
for
the
next
couple
of
years
or
weeks
cheers
d
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
will
definitely
purchase
another
overall
i
found
it
messy
and
hard
to
grab
a
hold
of
like
the
cat
though
not
bad
but
the
flavor
left
me
wanting
a
little
more
it
was
a
little
muddled
and
probably
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
oak
for
my
tastes
d
not
a
beer
for
everyone
people
might
be
scared
by
the
souwerness
but
the
oak
taste
is
real
good
its
a
beer
for
the
summer
refreshing
lightly
chilled
and
for
cold
days
not
chilled
o
while
all
jp
brews
are
aged
in
oak
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
only
one
that
ive
had
that
has
really
screamed
oak
to
me
i
still
strive
for
more
sourfunkiness
in
my
beer
d
high
one
of
my
favorite
reasonably
priced
american
wild
ales
worth
seeking
out
my
favorite
by
far
of
the
few
jolly
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
overall
wow
what
a
special
brew
never
have
i
tasted
such
a
smooth
yet
aggressively
flavored
beer
i
was
hooked
after
one
whiff
but
found
myself
taking
sip
after
sip
to
try
and
put
words
to
the
complex
assault
of
flavors
that
were
being
evoked
overall
this
beer
is
holding
up
great
nice
sour
cherry
flavors
and
a
good
amount
of
oak
shows
through
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
pretty
drinkable
di
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
it
was
extremely
sour
and
didnt
bring
a
whole
lot
else
while
not
as
expected
this
was
a
great
beer
even
without
the
funk
and
with
a
downplayed
sourness
theres
still
enough
underneath
to
carry
it
if
i
could
tweak
it
id
let
the
wild
yeast
run
a
bit
but
as
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
id
be
happy
to
spend
an
evening
with
a
couple
bottles
of
this
oh
yeah
and
i
love
the
cat
on
the
bottle
art
i
enjoyed
this
however
it
seems
a
lot
has
fallen
out
of
it
i
would
assume
there
would
be
more
cherry
flavor
when
fresh
drinkability
i
thought
the
sour
fruitiness
would
be
present
start
to
finish
but
the
hops
at
the
end
are
a
little
overpowering
to
those
flavors
d
this
is
a
sipper
and
a
tough
one
to
figure
out
love
it
it
is
so
unique
i
have
never
had
a
wild
ale
and
i
am
a
fan
this
was
also
the
first
offering
i
have
had
form
jolly
pumpkin
my
beer
store
has
two
more
offerings
i
am
going
to
swoop
them
up
today
overall
as
stated
above
i
can
no
longer
say
that
i
dont
really
like
sours
very
pleasnt
enoyable
and
easy
drinking
the
taste
is
not
good
its
supposed
to
be
a
wild
ale
but
its
more
like
a
combination
between
a
wild
ale
and
an
flanders
ale
but
they
dont
know
which
they
wanted
to
do
it
its
light
sour
but
not
very
good
with
a
bad
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
disappointing
effort
d
at
first
the
unbalanced
funkiness
is
a
bit
too
strong
but
after
several
sips
the
beer
becomes
very
drinkable
would
definitely
drink
again
i
would
try
it
again
but
i
couldnt
do
too
many
of
these
at
a
time
i
attempted
to
share
this
bottle
with
some
family
but
no
one
had
more
than
a
sip
before
making
an
interesting
face
and
complaining
drinkability
if
the
bottle
was
a
tad
cheaper
id
make
this
a
routine
beer
a
very
well
crafted
beer
by
ron
jeffries
this
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
blend
of
aromas
and
flavors
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
this
finishes
dry
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
but
such
a
large
bottle
is
a
lot
to
drink
this
is
a
very
good
wild
ale
and
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
must
try
definitely
the
best
jolly
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tried
d
this
is
very
tart
and
a
bit
boozy
for
a
sour
ale
it
is
not
highly
drinkable
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
brew
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
that
likes
flemish
reds
and
i
will
be
having
it
again
d
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
much
easier
to
approach
than
other
sours
i
think
i
could
finish
the
bottle
myself
but
am
much
happier
splitting
it
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sourfest
this
is
not
the
way
to
go
but
otherwise
worth
the
try
d
jolly
pumpkin
i
apologize
for
last
review
of
the
la
roja
i
was
young
and
naive
to
your
sour
ways
please
forgive
me
i
promise
i
will
visit
you
more
often
im
not
the
same
person
i
was
then
please
allow
me
this
second
chance
so
what
do
you
say
can
we
have
a
fresh
start
d
yet
another
very
well
crafted
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
its
one
of
those
stepping
stone
sours
that
people
not
used
sours
can
get
in
to
with
its
good
taste
worth
getting
to
drink
drinkability
a
decent
brew
and
this
was
my
first
wild
ale
so
its
hard
to
compare
drinkability
is
not
really
good
i
couldnt
really
drink
think
of
a
regular
basis
maybe
once
in
a
while
but
not
too
often
the
mouth
feel
has
a
sort
of
odd
dryness
to
it
that
i
dont
really
like
drinkability
is
a
little
low
i
dont
think
ill
order
more
than
one
glass
of
this
the
smell
was
all
spices
nutmeg
and
coriander
mainly
with
some
citrus
the
tast
was
also
citrus
spice
malt
nutmeg
with
a
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
at
750ml
is
just
too
much
but
what
bliss
i
also
have
to
mention
that
i
had
list
at
a
pub
and
paid
over
25
usd
drinkability
from
what
i
have
been
experiencing
very
so
i
am
already
putting
this
on
my
list
to
pick
up
more
tomorrow
at
half
the
cost
of
temptation
and
consecration
it
is
a
nice
mix
in
and
does
a
pretty
damn
good
job
long
green
pepper
finish
spicy
green
herb
finish
this
was
my
first
sour
ale
and
i
quite
enjoyed
it
the
pour
was
a
coppery
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
that
took
a
long
time
to
go
down
the
smell
was
similar
to
red
wine
with
a
bit
of
cherries
and
some
oak
at
first
the
taste
was
fairly
astringent
and
quite
sour
but
as
it
warmed
up
the
astringency
dissapeared
and
a
tart
cherry
flavor
remained
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
bubbly
this
went
down
fairly
easy
especially
after
it
warmed
up
but
im
not
sure
id
run
out
and
buy
another
bottle
perhaps
id
try
some
flanders
ale
d
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
a
good
beer
drinkability
i
mean
i
finished
it
no
problem
its
a
relatively
easydrinking
beer
but
its
more
for
me
due
to
the
lack
of
much
flavor
its
worth
a
shot
but
at
what
you
pay
for
it
there
are
certainly
other
worth
alternatives
if
you
are
a
fan
of
wild
ales
this
would
probably
be
right
up
your
alley
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
in
fact
love
concencration
and
when
i
took
my
first
swig
that
is
exactly
what
i
thought
of
mouth
feel
was
full
and
sparkly
the
taste
was
not
quite
as
sour
as
the
great
concencaration
but
the
aftertaste
was
i
thought
was
much
better
and
very
desirable
overall
a
great
beer
at
11
99
a
bottle
i
think
it
is
a
great
substitute
for
the
beer
that
ive
been
trading
for
this
is
very
nicely
tart
and
malty
without
the
expected
funk
drinkablity
not
the
best
flanders
brew
i
have
had
but
definatly
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
very
good
and
i
had
no
problems
finishing
off
a
750ml
bottle
go
get
it
distributed
by
stone
brewery
san
diego
ca
very
lively
carbonation
but
spot
on
for
the
style
this
was
my
first
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
im
enjoying
it
immensely
drinkability
it
wouldnt
be
had
to
finish
a
750
ml
bottle
in
a
sitting
d
a
beer
i
could
sip
on
all
night
worth
every
penny
i
paid
for
it
once
again
im
impressed
by
a
jolly
pumpkin
brew
there
brews
are
different
enough
that
you
can
tell
them
apart
and
keep
you
wanting
more
but
all
share
the
same
common
theme
of
excellent
artisan
ales
brewed
with
wild
yeast
great
stuff
750ml
capped
bottled
served
at
45
degrees
in
a
tulip
blend

indicated
on
the
back
label
poured
a
murky
brownishplum
color
with
a
one
inch
offwhite
head
that
slowly
receded
into
a
pockmarked
frothy
cap
and
then
a
congealed
dollop
of
white
big
sour
fruity
red
berries
cherries
nose
intermixed
with
wood
a
bit
of
mustiness
follows
towards
the
back
taste
follows
nose
but
fruit
flavors
are
incredibly
muted
by
the
sour
with
the
wood
character
really
coming
out
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
falls
between
light
and
mediumbodied
with
a
slightly
prickly
effervescence
that
finally
culminates
in
a
dry
finish
interesting
brew
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
but
something
i
would
definitely
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
to
enjoy
i
happen
to
be
in
the
mood
not
my
favorite
jp
but
this
one
really
stands
up
d
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
wild
ale
however
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
look
forward
to
sampling
more
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
in
the
future
drinkability
enjoyable
not
too
intense
i
e
rich
or
hoppy
but
still
not
a
beer
id
particularly
want
to
session
unfortunately
i
lost
about
13
of
my
bomber
to
the
gushing
d
wow
this
beer
is
remarkable
very
complex
and
dynamic
but
somehow
the
beer
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
rewards
the
drinker
who
takes
hisher
time
a
musttry
overall
an
all
around
solid
wild
ale
the
best
part
is
the
smell
but
the
taste
is
pretty
good
as
well
solid
if
not
groundbreaking
i
will
buy
again
after
i
try
some
other
jp
offerings
d
pretty
good
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
wanted
but
still
nice
ill
be
buying
it
again
for
sure
but
with
lower
expectations
not
bad
at
all
a
finger
of
foam
on
a
medium
pour
thick
head
that
lingered
for
10
minutes
dull
rust
to
ruby

quite

some

very
subtle
signs

t
the
tartness
on
the
nose
comes
through
on
the
tongue
some
unripe
apple
what
tastes
like
tannins
presumably
from
the
oak
aging
some
vanilla
in
the
distant
the

on

label
seems
understated
as
alcohol
is
upfront
3

m

d
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
beer
and
i
only
realized
after
opening
the
beer
that
i
didnt
pick
my
favorite
style
trying
to
look
at
the
beer
objectively
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
brew
3
50
taste
was
not
far
from
the
appearance
either
tart
sour
flavor
upfront
becoming
a
little
bitter
with
a
hint
of
oak
finishing
very
dry
i
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
with
no
hint
that
it
was
nearly
twice
as
strong
as
other
lambics
i
have
had
and
loved
sipping
it
from
a
champagne
flute
as
a
nightcap
after
a
very
long
day
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
the
sour
is
just
an
up
front
taste
that
gives
way
but
coats
the
mouth
sours
are
a
lot
like
super
hoppy
beers
a
big
wave
at
the
beginning
they
mellow
but
coat
your
tongue
with
their
flavor
flav
gotta
branch
out
more
now
worth
trying
if
you
like
sours
and
especially
if
you
like
both
sours
and
oak
aged
beers
drinkability
as
always
its
another
weird
wild
ride
from
jolly
pumpkin
to
say
these
beers
arent
for
everyone
is
a
huge
understatement
paired
well
with
the
song
here
i
dreamt
i
was
an
architect
by
the
decemberists
d
this
is
a
very
good
and
interesting
beer
but
not
exceptional
the
smell
outweighs
the
taste
which
is
kind
of
a
shame
and
as
notes
it
got
better
after
a
while
in
the
glass
would
definitely
have
it
again
if
it
was
offered
this
is
a
very
tasty
sour
beer
d
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
jolly
pumpkin
is
a
nice
brewery
from
the
couple
of
beers
that
i
have
wouldnt
drink
this
as
a
everyday
staple
but
it
would
be
good
to
try
with
my
friends
that
like
wine
i
love
the
look
of
this
beer
with
its
deep
reddish
brown
hues
and
nice
creamy
head
which
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
it
smells
a
bit
sour
and
earthy
the
taste
matches
the
nose
along
with
a
bit
of
woodsy
and
caramel
sweetness
to
balance
the
sourness
of
the
brew
its
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
woodsy
aftertaste
one
of
those
beers
thats
great
for
one
or
two
but
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
that
mouthfeel
is
dryly
carbonated
crisplight
bodied
very
interesting
beer
d
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
sour
while
maintaining
the
same
drinkability
but
overall
very
good
d
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
on
this
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
wild
ale
very
complex
blend
of
flavors
and
tasty
gotta
love
american
brewers
doing
funky
oak
aged
belgian
ales
and
doing
it
right
appears
an
inviting
deep
russet
redbrown
a
healthy
and
foamy
head
both
in
the
glass
and
in
the
remainder
of
the
bottle
lasts
as
long
as
the
beer
does
this
is
really
lambicy
up
front
tart
lime
and
apple
lemon
rind
funky
wet
wood
and
dust
however
as
you
drink
it
and
as
it
warms
the
delicious
hearty
caramel
notes
of
a
well
made
belgian
ale
come
through
from
underneath
once
your
tongue
gets
used
to
the
sourness
theres
plenty
more
to
this
beer
sweet
earthy
ripe
and
fruity
this
beer
has
an
excellent
prickly
and
lively
texture
quite
complex
flavors
and
keeps
you
interested
through
and
through
a
real
piece
of
work
in
artisan
brewing
d
a
promising
start
then
this
brew
fell
flat
on
its
face
i
like
the
experimentation
but
the
end
product
is
just
ok
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
stay
away
from
this
one
but
certainly
no
need
to
seek
it
out
d
this
one
was
looking
like
such
a
winner
until
i
took
a
sip
i
felt
like
i
would
either
love
to
see
it
more
sour
or
more
caramel
barleywinesque
with
just
a
touch
of
sourness
but
the
balance
that
was
struck
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
for
comparison
overall
this
is
probably
the
first
jp
beer
ive
had
that
really
dissapointed
me
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
in
any
way
but
not
up
to
their
standards
i
think
they
could
put
a
little
more
effort
into
this
one
and
make
it
a
better
beer
i
wont
pay
the
high
price
for
this
again
when
i
can
get
nearly
any
belgian
flemish
for
less
still
an
ok
beer
though
in
fact
enjoyable
dont
regret
the
purchase
d
this
was
a
good
beer
my
first
wild
ale
but
i
enjoyed
something
different
and
this
was
certainly
different
but
very
enjoyable
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
large
tan
head
that
hangs
around
for
some
time
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
funky
aroma
of
barnyard
and
sour
fruit
such
as
cherries
and
apples
the
flavor
is
moderately
sour
and
funky
the
finish
is
slightly
sour
and
dry
has
a
light
body
that
is
well
carbonated
seems
fitting
for
the
flavors
middle
of
the
road
when
it
comes
to
sour
and
funky
but
is
pleasantly
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink

d
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
wild
beers
i
have
had
plenty
of
sour
funk
but
very
easy
to
drink
my
palette
is
dead
after
this
beer
a
nice
blend
between
a
flanders
red
and
an
american
wild
give
this
a
try
if
you
see
it
around
and
are
looking
for
something
different
good
stuff
out
of
dexter
michigan
drinkability
for
what
it
is
i
think
its
quite
drinkable
the
one
pint
went
down
pretty
quick
for
me
its
crisp
not
too
sour
but
complex
and
interesting
i
will
definately
buy
again
the
drink
is
both
mellow
and
crisp
with
creamy
feel
borne
of
a
huge
malty
body
and
superb
carbonation
the
drink
is
quaffable
and
delicious
and
has
a
catpirate
on
the
label
what
could
be
better
i
would
be
able
to
put
back
a
few
of
these
easy
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
d
i
wouldnt
consume
a
whole
lot
of
it
but
it
is
an
interesting
beer
all
around
and
definitely
a
good
gateway
to
a
more
sour
beer
not
as
intense
as
others
that
ive
had
but
a
well
constructed
beer
id
like
to
sample
some
more
from
jolly
pumpkin
drinkability
a
very
fine
brew
from
jp
not
too
sour
not
too
sweet
just
very
balanced
none
of
the
flavors
really
stand
out
too
much
and
thats
just
fine
just
nice
and
pleasant
the
7
2
is
nowhere
to
be
found
the
funk
and
sourness
are
wellintegrated
just
another
solid
pleasant
drinkable
good
introductory
wild
ale
from
jp
m
d
a
modest
carbonation
and
semidry
finish
one
of
my
favourite
aspects
of
these
styles
such
a
marvelous
feel
and
quite
easy
drinking
between
the
tame
sourness
and
reasonable
abv
to
sip
with
not
too
bad
at
all
overall
a
good
but
disappointing
beer
i
was
really
wanting
to
like
this
one
their
calabaza
blanca
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
but
havent
found
another
from
them
to
match
it
yet
gonna
keep
trying
though
mild
recommend
for
me
probably
one
and
done
maybe
one
more
shot
if
i
could
easily
get
pretty
drinkable
for
my
first
reviewed
real
sour
a
very
complicated
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
notes
the
initial
funky
sourness
is
akin
to
bam
noire
but
the
subtleties
of
each
beer
are
quite
disparate
enjoyable
but
not
great
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
and
warming
for
7
2
seemed
like
10
interesting
brew
but
one
i
would
not
try
again
seemed
like
it
was
missing
something
still
a
great
brew
though
mostly
because
of
the
funk
im
going
to
chalk
this
one
up
to
me
being
moderatly
sick
and
thus
not
getting
the
full
experience
ineresting
to
say
the
least
but
im
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
more
than
one
a
sitting
overall
jolly
pumpkin
is
one
of
americas
better
brewers
and
la
roja
is
definitely
one
of
the
great
beers
in
their
lineup
highly
recommended
a
decent
beer
my
first
american
wild
ale
tastes
very
similar
to
a
flanders
red
to
be
honest
just
more
subdued
definitely
a
sipper
i
was
hoping
for
more
flavors
but
all
i
got
was
the
cherry
tartness
overall
not
a
bad
beer
drinkability
is
decent
this
one
is
quite
dry
and
lacks
the
sweet
quality
that
usually
comes
with
the
fruit
notes
however
the
flavors
are
composed
nicely
and
produce
a
solid
profile
could
be
a
bit
lighter
on
the
dryness
but
still
a
good
wild
ale
from
jolly
pumpkin
two
finger
off
white
head
on
initial
pour
that
fades
semi
slowly
leaving
a
thick
lace
on
the
glass
lacing
is
persistent
smell
is
oaky
sour
goodness
dill
vinegar
yeast
sour
dominates
the
palette
really
cant
taste
anything
else
not
that
thats
bad
what
i
taste
is
pleasing
i
get
some
mild
sweets
in
the
back
some
decent
balanced
carbonation
no
bad
la
rojas
above
average
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
but
has
a
few
kinks
to
work
out
my
biggest
complaint
is
the
overwhelming
cherry
cough
syruptype
flavor
if
the
cherry
flavor
and
the
alcohol
presence
could
be
toned
down
a
little
i
think
itd
be
improved
as
it
is
its
just
alright
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
very
very
hazy
theres
probably
a
5cm
head
on
top
thats
a
yellowtan
color
its
tough
to
judge
an
american
wild
ale
on
appearance
since
they
range
so
much
in
color
and
are
allowed
to
i
suppose
the
smell
is
like
apple
cider
a
bit
of
vinegar
general
sour
smells
but
there
is
a
very
clear
scent
of
malty
sweetness
underneath
it
actually
smells
good
but
a
bit
different
than
usual
not
all
out
sour
the
taste
is
difficult
to
judge
based
on
the
classification
too
from
the
different
american
wild
ales
ive
had
this
one
has
a
very
distinct
bready
taste
but
the
taste
is
still
funky
not
as
sour
as
some
but
pleasant
theres
like
a
subtle
vinegar
flavor
and
without
carbonation
this
would
taste
sort
of
like
a
sour
red
wine
very
full
bodied
almost
chewy
it
kind
of
leaves
a
funny
feeling
on
the
tongue
and
roof
of
your
mouth
tasting
it
you
would
have
no
idea
that
theres
alcohol
in
it
until
you
feel
it
overall
a
good
beer
kind
of
expensive
but
id
recommend
it
to
all
jolly
pumpkin
where
were
you
when
i
lived
in
ann
arbor
i
have
yet
to
have
a
single
beer
that
i
havent
loved
this
one
is
no
exception
honestly
i
dont
try
many
of
these
but
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
more
drinkable
editions
to
the
style
d
this
beer
bounces
all
over
the
place
as
you
finish
the
bottle
and
i
enjoy
that
reminds
me
at
times
of
flanders
red
saisons
biere
de
garde
etc
lacking
the
sweetness
expected
from
a
flanders
red
i
really
enjoy
this
especially
at
its
price
and
availability
dnot
something
youre
likely
to
drink
two
bottles
of
this
in
a
sitting
first
its
fairly
expensive
and
second
its
more
of
a
sippingpay
attention
to
it
kind
of
beer
still
its
very
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
amber
with
a
2
fingered
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smeel
was
of
a
sour
ale
the
taste
was
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
from
the
nose
i
beelve
this
is
my
first
wild
ale
it
was
interesting
some
kind
of
like
a
underhopped
big
pale
ale
with
sour
flavors
the
mouthfeel
seemed
nice
and
the
carbonation
level
might
have
been
a
little
low
i
drank
half
a
bottle
of
this
and
it
was
my
only
sipper
of
the
evening
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
clean
da
sour
beer
that
is
approachable
for
newcomers
while
having
enough
character
to
excite
the
old
hats
this
beer
is
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
smells
like
red
wine
tastes
like
white
spices
abound
makes
me
think
of
pumpkin
pie
with
a
cheap
chardonnay
chaser
sour
enough
to
make
you
call
your
mommy
extremely
complex
whoa
dude
you
just
blew
my
mind
drinkability
not
interesting
enough
to
want
to
drink
lots
of
it
overall
i
think
some
age
did
this
beer
a
lot
of
good
wonder
what
it
will
be
like
in
another
year

d
yes
please
wow
man
do
i
love
this
beer
not
only
is
it
my
favorite
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
one
of
my
favorite
americanman
beers
period
serving
type
bottle
overall
not
bad
for
my
first
experience
with
an
american
wild
ale
i
think
this
style
of
beer
is
something
that
my
palate
will
have
to
adjust
to
d
fantastic
this
was
a
great
beer
to
sit
around
and
share
i
think
this
would
also
make
a
great
one
to
sit
outside
on
a
fall
day
reminds
me
of
drinking
fresh
cider
but
better
dynamite
will
definitely
try
this
again
and
try
other
jolly
pumpkin
brews
i
havent
had
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
beautiful
presentation
from
the
label
to
the
nose
i
did
finish
the
bottle
and
will
look
for
a
younger
offering
but
the
astringency
was
simply
out
of
balance
with
the
aroma
and
flavors
this
certainly
is
a
fine
example
of
a
wild
ale
and
worthy
for
all
who
appreciate
this
style
this
is
my
first
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
think
it
is
great
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
offerings
keep
up
the
great
work
jolly
pumpkin
mouthfeel
is
over
carbonated
and
detracts
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
phenols
limit
the
drinkability
but
it
does
smell
wonderfully
too
bad
things
didnt
come
together
better
very
easy
to
drink
but
flavor
is
complex
enough
to
make
this
a
sipper
very
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
dark
cherry
color
the
head
is
large
billowy
and
lasts
until
all
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
beautiful
bretta
dates
and
other
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
acidic
and
dry
with
a
little
oak
a
good
amount
of
barnyard
and
a
large
amount
of
bretta
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
refreshingly
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
d
nice
funkiness
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
but
it
was
nice
to
split
it
with
a
few
ba
friends
the
scores
on
the
individual
elements
dont
do
this
one
justics
this
doesnt
wallow
in
beautiful
chemistry
but
i
actually
like
its
mild
disjointedness
this
is
a
very
cool
complex
offering
is
this
stuff
supposed
to
be
exceptionally
drinkable
i
mean
its
a
good
sipper
and
i
think
thats
what
it
is
trying
to
be
im
going
to
kill
a
750
before
bed
but
it
will
not
be
gone
in
15
minutes
or
anything

the
liquid
is
deep

with
a
stable
creamy

buttery

and
just
a

the

is
graceful
but
the

has
a
minor
problem
it
feels
a
bit
separated
from
the

than
most
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
it
had
a
decent
spicy
pumpkin
scent
and
just
got
better
once
consumed
it
was
sweet
with
lots
of
pumpkin
with
a
medium
to
heavy
body
it
also
left
a
solid
pumpkin
aftertaste
i
enjoyed
the

very
much

an
amber

color
murky
with
a
tall

lots
of
sticking

acidic
barrel
notes
in

a
sweet

with
a
large
citrusy
hop
bite
midlate
palate
more
funky
than
sour
as
its
often
described
and
i
like
funky
this
just
seems
to
be
a
forced
funk
lots
earthy
notes
of
over
ripe
fruits
and
hay
all
and
all
it
really
falls
short
for
me
flat
in
flavor
almost
one
dimensional
wood
is
just
a
tease
once
the
body
is
felt
medium
body
gueze
like
in
nature
very
bright
carbonation
and
a
seltzery
feel
to
it
possibly
its
just
young
it
just
drops
off
the
face
of
the
earth
mid
palate
d
its
odd
at
times
with
some
sips
this
tastes
to
me
like
a
stinky
cheese
but
its
dry
and
very
drinkable
one
of
those
beers
where
no
two
sips
are
quite
the
same
highly
drinkable
alcohol
content
is
wellhidden
call
me
a
philistine
but
i
actually
enjoy
this
more
than
the
more
vinegary
la
roja
grand
reserve
i
could
easily
drink
this
over
and
over
again
cannot
go
wrong
with
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
have
not
tried
this
one
before
and
wanted
to
before
cracking
open
of
my
grand
reserves
turns
an
amber
style
that
i
am
not
too
fond
of
into
a
really
good
beer
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
recommended
really
quite
a
drinkable
beer
the
sour
flavors
arent
terribly
bold
making
it
easy
to
down
good
stuff
funk
fanatics
this
is
a
must
try
very
enjoyable
would
most
assuredly
buy
again
certainly
enjoyed
this
one
not
too
sour
not
too
sweet
im
still
new
with
these
wild
ales
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
from
this
unique
brewery
md
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
and
smooth
light
carbonation
one
bottle
is
plenty
but
it
is
a
great
sipper
jp
has
some
really
good
stuff
that
i
had
recently
this
is
more
pedestrian
d
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
rodenbach
but
not
as
sour
very
well
crafted
and
palate
is
extremely
smooth
and
pleasant
to
drink
wow
with
a
friend
if
you
like
not
a
bad
beer
well
worth
pairing
with
a
piece
of
pepper
jack
cheese
not
an
everyday
beer
but
a
good
bridge
to
more
sour
ales
try
some
if
you
see
it
i
love
this
flandersamerican
wild
ale
hybrid
the
tart
fruits
light
sweetness
and
musky
funk
simply
makes
this
shine
another
great
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
the
drinkability
is
good
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
has
some
interesting
flemish
red
type
flavor
going
on
in
it
a
very
nice
american
wild
ale
thats
well
worth
a
try
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
beer
but
definitely
not
my
last
nice
on
its
own
unique
but
really
shines
with
cream
cheese
covered
with
cherries
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
and
reasonably
affordable
not
too
thin
with
some
smoothness
before
perceiving
more
acidic
texture
tight
moderate
carbonation
an
excellent
beer
which
could
easily
be
compared
to
the
best
of
the
belgians
and
a
great
label
too
d
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
wont
be
my
last
love
the
style
love
the
beer
not
too
sweet
good
complexity
smoothes
out
notably
upon
warming
and
transforms
from
bracing
to
engaging
very
nice
but
i
might
still
give
blend
10
another
year
to
taper
off
lower
abv
and
a
light
body
make
this
easy
to
drink
in
hotter
weather
sour
enough
to
make
you
like
it
but
not
complex
enough
to
make
you
love
it
nicely
drinkable
i
had
no
problem
drinking
the
750ml
bottle
this
was
a
nice
beer
but
a
step
down
from
what
i
was
expecting
considering
how
much
i
like
jolly
pumpkins
other
offerings
beer
poured
red
with
a
long
lasting
impressive
tan
head
nose
is
quite
sour
of
cherries
and
cranberries
taste
is
complex
of
sour
cherries
musty
oak
and
the
belgian
yeast
strain
is
almost
champagne
like
leading
to
a
very
dry
finish
that
is
leaving
a
sour
trail
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
champagne
like
bubbly
yet
smooth
easy
going
across
the
palate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
beer
is
light
and
leaves
the
palate
coated
with
the
sour
funk
as
advertised
it
was
fun
branching
out
to
this
style
and
look
forward
to
trying
others
d
there
really
isnt
anything
displeasing
about
this
beer
and
it
goes
down
easily
overall
id
say
its
a
nice
twist
on
a
style
that
i
really
enjoy
it
just
never
lived
up
to
the
initial
aroma
which
was
amazing
drinkability
is
moderate
flavors
are
alright
and
alcohol
is
relatively
low
making
for
an
easily
consumed
brew
still
i
did
enjoy
it
as
i
liked
the
sour
bite
i
just
cant
quite
love
it
as
much
as
i
should
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
with
a
crisp
carbonation
very
tasty
though
not
one
i
would
want
very
often
d
overall
i
really
i
enjoyed
this
beer
if
there
was
a
catergory
for
drinking
experience
i
would
give
this
beer
a
five
because
i
never
wanted
the
moment
i
was
drinking
this
beer
in
to
end
i
can
say
easily
though
that
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
warm
not
hot
summer
night
with
no
misquitos
and
a
small
breeze
when
this
happens
the
beer
is
absolutly
perfect
to
be
honest
though
this
beer
becomes
a
bit
blander
once
your
tongue
gets
used
to
the
sourness
but
still
tastes
good
it
is
a
very
complex
beer
that
demands
your
attention
and
that
should
be
paid
attention
to
past
the
sourness
this
one
got
me
amped
for
the
wild
ale
style
i
guess
this
one
aged
pretty
well
d
not
bad
again
the
lack
of
a
totally
dominant
sour
taste
really
helped
the
drinkability
out
for
me
out
of
a
750
ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
an
egg
shell
colored
head
that
was
thick
and
fluffy
in
the
tulip
glass
some
nice
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
strong
red
wine
tart
and
tangy
lemon
concentrate
the
taste
has
red
wine
characteristics
lemon
sour
cherries
unripe
tropical
fruit
the
feel
is
light
with
very
active
carbonation
perhaps
a
bit
too
strong
finishes
sour
and
tart
not
big
on
sourtart
brews
so
it
kills
the
drinkability
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
aggressive
as
well
however
this
is
a
well
built
beer
and
anybody
that
likes
the
tart
sour
should
like
this
beer
a
very
nice
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
subtle
flavors
with
apples
upfront
and
smooth
caramel
very
reminiscent
of
candied
apples
makes
it
a
fun
smooth
and
memorable
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
but
unfortunately
the
flavors
dont
get
time
to
really
marinate
on
the
tongue
the
way
that
the
best
belgian
reds
do
the
carbonation
seems
to
lift
the
flavors
away
at
the
very
moment
they
would
do
well
to
engage
the
flavor
receptors
a
hazy
dark
oak
with
a
silky
sand
colored
head
the
nose
has
a
plether
of
tart
and
citrusy
tropical
fruits
molded
yeasts
and
earthy
manure
very
nice
indeed
the
taste
begins
mith
some
sweet
caramel
malts
and
delicate
ripe
fruit
then
an
intensifying
wave
of
tart
cherries
and
sour
apples
with
some
oaky
spices
delicious
the
body
is
thick
and
silky
yet
has
a
refreshing
crispyness
to
it
a
good
example
of
the
style
just
lacks

the

lists
this
as

rather
than
a
belgian
dark

this
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
very

around
the
edges
and
not
very
attractive
in
most
respects
not
trashing
it
it
just
could
be
so
much
better
if
the

was
toned
down

overall

was

however
the
flavors
seem
to
be
fighting
against
each
other
not
one
id
seek
out
again
and
honestly
my
least
favorite
in
the
jp
line
so
far
im
fascinated
by
the
jolly
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
sampled
exceptionally
crafted
highly
complex
and
dangerously
drinkable
very
different
and
worth
seeking
out

intesely
flavored

pours

fell
to
a
trace
but
laced
well

seriously
fruity
and
tart
with
a
woodsy
musky
aroma
flavors
of
raspberries
and
cherries
shine
in
the
foreground
the
rounding
out
with
a
flanders
red
smoothness
and
lightness
remains
granny
smith
apple
tart
into
the
finish
picks
up
a
little
of
a
framboise
flavor
aroma
and
tartness
just
not
as
sweet
remains
a
bit
musky
and
oakey
in
flavor
finishes
a
bit
astringent
and
a
tart
dryness
still
a
complex
and
flavorful
beer
the
barrelaging
really
just
ruins
this
its
too
bright
and
forward
and
lets
precious
little
of
the
beer
shine
through
what
they
provide
it
not
congruent
to
the
beer
itself
and
the
result
is
something
that
is
muddled
and
atonal
if
not
downright
ugly
i
suspect
these
are
new
and
just
too
intense
after
a
couple
more
runthroughs
these
barrels
might
work
perfectly
and
maybe
this
would
be
a
whole
new
animal
then
but
i
suspect
the
maltbill
is
needy
as
well
simply
put
on
the
whole
it
needs
help
it
is
interesting
for
a
second
or
two
then
it
becomes
work
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
took
a
bit
of
adjustment
to
get
used
to
but
once
that
happened
drinking
the
bottle
was
not
a

this
is
a
sipper

be

once

of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
some
caramel
and
a
lot
of
sweetness
there
is
also
some
spice
that
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
possibly
a
port
or
sherry
aroma
this
is
the
best
i
can
come
up
with
the
flavor
isnt
nearly
as
impressive
as
the
aroma
its
nice
with
some
nutty
character
and
some
biscuit
but
it
could
use
some
other
character
finish
is
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
mouth
is
a
bit
rough
from
the
tart
citric
flavors
and
some
of
the
carbonation
good
beer
but
my
least
favorite
from
jp
clear
dark
red
color
body
with
a
tan
fluffy
head
that
left
a
good
bit
of
streaky
lacing
sweet
ripe
fruit
notes
a
bit
of
spiciness
and
some
caramel
make
up
most
of
the
aroma
light
yeast
notes
as
well
big
sweet
caramel
covered
fruit
flavor
starts
it
off
some
dark
fruits
with
a
bit
of
peppery
spiciness
underneath
a
bit
yeasty
and
some
sugar
notes
ends
with
a
spicy
fruit
finish
lively
creamy
feel
and
a
bit
dry
at
time
really
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
plenty
going
on
here
but
its
not
going
to
overpower
you
with
big
flavors
which
is
nice
sometimes
i
want
to
love
the
jolly
pumpkin
beers
i
really
do
theyve
certainly
done
their
homework
on
presentation
great
brewery
name
beer
names
labels
bottles
etc
ultimately
though
the
contents
of
those
bottles
is
the
only
thing
that
matters
i
have
little
doubt
that
with
a
few
years
under
its
belt
this
will
be
a
better
if
still
not
a
great
beer
right
now
i
cant
recommend
it
thanks
to
deejaydan
for
the
bottle
light
body
with
carbonation
that
absolutely
explodes
on
the
tongue
great
beer
with
dinner
not
super
quaffable
but
nice
i
noted
active
carbonation
and
a
nice
texture
to
the
mouthfeel
there
was
a
bit
of
a
sting
in
the
end
and
a
very
yeast
aftertaste
but
overall
a
very
nice
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
enjoyable
translation
of
the
style
and
will
stock
it
in
our
store
and
take
it
home
on
occasion
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
my
initial
reaction
was
that
this
beer
tatsed
more
like
wine
than
any
beer
ive
ever
had
after
a
little
while
it
was
dominated
by
a
familiar
taste
but
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
it
then
it
hit
me
jim
beam
after
that
it
was
so
dominant
i
finally
had
to
stop
halfway
through
the
750
i
had
to
pour
it
out
it
was
starting
to
make
me
sick
amazing
that
this
is
a
relatively
low
abv
beer
because
the
whiskey
flavor
is
all
i
could
taste
i
like
beer
not
whiskey
not
for
me
pours
an
amberred
hue
with
a
luscious
thick
white
head
the
aroma
at
first
seems
accented
by
caramel
with
a
hint
of
oak
but
later
on
i
notice
a
hint
of
black
licorice
almost
a
quarterinch
layer
of
foam
stay
puts
as
i
take
in
the
aroma
for
several
minutes
the
mouthfeel
of
this
first
sip
is
very
soft
the
mouthfeel
feels
a
bit
thin
at
first
but
gets
thicker
towards
the
finish
some
lacework
is
left
as
i
take
a
few
sips
the
sublime
caramel
and
toffee
malt
flavors
in
this
beer
are
almost
overpowered
by
a
brazen
rumlike
middle
but
the
finish
is
coated
with
a
hint
of
earthy
spice
anise
perhaps
or
a
hint
of
nutmeg
coated
in
candy
sugar
theres
some
bitterness
from
hops
too
which
tends
to
express
itself
more
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
also
have
to
admit
i
like
the
buccaneer
kitty
kat
featured
on
the
label
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
its
not
an
everyday
beer
but
one
for
a
special
occasion
this
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
to
give
a
person
whos
fond
of
red
wines
drinkability
is
good
in
terms
of
finishing
the
bottle
i
likely
wouldnt
crack
another
one
with
any
haste
nice
remarkable
taste
just
a
round
enveloping
rush
of
booze
not
much
hops
or
yeast
that
i
was
expecting
mouthfeel
was
quick
and
acrid
like
a
shot
of
vodka
active
carbonation
gives
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
its
sufficiently
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol
theres
a
lot
going
on
but
overall
its
kind
of
underwhelming
cheers
finger
licking
good
overall
a
very
good
beer
the
flavors
meld
well
and
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
from
the
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
aroma
plums
carmel
fruity
yeast
hints
of
grapes
and
alcohol
and
a
sourness
finishes
it
off
a
very
enjoyable
aroma
flavor
fruity
with
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
yeast
plums
and
sour
grapes
slàinte
very
drinkable
this
brewery
is
already
producing
phenomenal
beers
i
cant
wait
for
the
future
very
satisfying
thanks

gentle

accompany
the

very

im
with
mat
that
brewery
has
seized
the
meaning
of
crafting
like
no
other
and
in
the
car
state
of
all
places
poured
into

deeply

amber

head
lasts
and
laces
well
with
foamy
remnants
aroma
is
of
slightly
spicy
yeasts
with
barrel
notes
easily
noted
although
i
almost
wish
they
were
a
bit
more
in
the
background
taste
is
initally
a
somewhat
fruity
spice
bread
which
traipses
into
oakland
and
then
returns
with
a
dry
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
good
very
creamy
which
keeps
the
aging
notes
from
completely
taking
over
and
the
drinkability
is
great
another
good
one
from
jolly
pumpkin
if
youve
wondered
what
a
barrelaged
double
would
be
well
this
is
it
unlike
the
other
jps
that
are
just
touched
with
the
barrel
aging
the
barrel
is
a
serious
part
of
the
flavor
in
this
beer
this
is
enjoyable
and
unlike
a
barrelaged
tripel
the
double
is
a
little
more
robust
and
sits
a
bit
better
with
it
once
again
maybe
ill
make
my
obligatory
call
for
jp
in
pennsylvania
fairly
enjoyable
and
this
is
one
id
gladly
have
again
a
picture
of
wild
swings
is
not
what
im
drawing
most
of
the
time
this
beer
falls
somewhere
between
the
poles
but
these
extremes
do
exist
and
can
be
appreciated
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
regularly
enjoy
the
fruits
of
the
pumpkin
giving
this
beer
a
numbers
to
describe
is
rough
its
the
definiton
at
least
in
my
head
of
artisanal
and
id
like
to
leave
it
as
such
screw
the
ratings
and
read
the
reviews
ultimately
i
think
that
this
beer
is
a
little
out
of
wack
it
is
sort
of
in
the
gray
zone
between
conventionally
fermented
single
yeast
strain
fermented
beers
infected
beers
and
beers
that
are
fermented
purposefully
with
wild
yet
house
derived
character
this
beer
needs
to
decide
which
way
it
wants
to
go
and
i
would
certainly
be
in
favor
of
it
going
fully
funky
if
it
can
be
kept
in
balance
right
now
it
is
certainly
interesting
certainly
drinkable
and
even
enjoyable
but
it
seems
a
bit
muddled
by
various
competing
fermentation
by
products
i
could
see
a
bottle
of
this
beer
being
laid
down
for
a
year
or
two
and
becoming
quite
stellar
if
not
intriguingly
different
while
i
am
being
quite
critical
here
this
is
a
beer
that
i
am
quite
enjoying
and
i
will
look
forward
to
procuring
some
more
bottles
of
this
beer
cheers
to
jolly
pumpkin
for
pushing
the
boundaries
in
the
middle
of
america
and
cheers
to
my
personal
santa
who
delivered
this
treat
to
my
doorstep
there
are
just
too
many
offflavors
here
the
alcohol
is
too
strong
the
window
cleaner
fusels
the
cardboard
finish
tastes
like
a
7030
mix
between
the
godawful
ommegang
and
the
great
maudite
i
was
excited
to
try
a
new
belgianstyle
brew
from
a
michigan
brewery
but
go
ahead
and
pass
this
one
up
it
sucks
ass
the
beer
opens
a
little
watery
without
much
flavor
to
begin
then
the
taste
is
very
rich
with
sweet
apple
rind
dominating
there
are
also
notes
of
lime
orange
corriander
and
plum
there
is
pretty
much
no
hop
bitterness
to
this
beer
the
beer
is
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
light
to
medium
body
it
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
gladly
enjoy
again
and
again
this
is
a
great
beer
and
the
first
from
this
brewery
that
i
have
tried
i
will
be
trying
more
from
jolly
pumpkin
drinkability
is
very
good
the
sweet
sherry
notes
make
it
very
unique
if
your
tastes
lie
on
the
sweeter
side
you
will
love
this
beer
at
first
taste
i
didnt
think
id
like
this
beer
as
much
as
the
oro
de
calabaza
near
the
end
i
knew
id
like
it
at
least
as
much
now
i
cant
wait
for
the
next
one
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
this
beer
pours
a
brillian
auburn
color
with
yellow
highlights
and
a
small
foamy
tan
head
the
nose
is
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
with
notes
of
toasted
malts
spice
and
cherry
liquer
the
taste
begins
with
a
fruity
flavor
which
is
mainly
cherry
but
theres
also
some
banana
phenols
and
red
grape
tannins
in
here
like
a
hefeweizen
meets
merlot
mixture
the
toasted
malts
are
here
as
well
but
get
overwhelmed
by
the
alcohol
flavor
this
is
like
spiced
rum
at
times
the
alcohol
gets
too
strong
and
i
feel
it
towards
the
finish
the
yeasty
aspect
is
not
quite
there
in
the
finish
but
i
do
notice
a
slight
earthy
flavor
in
the
middle
that
is
probably
from
the
yeast
body
is
medium
and
not
too
lively
this
beer
has
excellent
potential
but
is
simply
too
young
right
now
try
it
in
a
year
and
it
will
be
fabulous
but
for
now
stick
with
the
oro
de
calabaza
boozier
than
the
squash
beer
previous
tempting
aromas
of
caramel
coated
grape
bubblegum
on
a
bed
of
greens
hard
edged
unpeeled
fruit
stand
out
against
a
backdrop
of
gingerbread
house
with
the
iced
roof
and
gum
drop
gate
more
mature
the
red
might
flow
easier
i
hope
that
jolly
pumpkin
is
around
in
five
years
for
a
newold
taste
comparison
good
heavens
what
a
beer
this
one
demands
your
attention
as
soon
as
you
sip
it
this
would
be
hazardous
as
a
session
beer
since
it
is
not
hard
to
drink
but
fairly
strong
jolly
pumpkin
nicely
done
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
than
this
i
want
the
idea
of
jolly
pumpkin
to
succeed
there
are
many
more
beers
to
come
out
i
will
be
waiting
eagerly
i
was
at
the
michigan
brewers
guild
summer
festival
and
saw
the
listing
for
jolly
pumpkin
i
had
visions
of
pumkin
ales
and
other
kitche
brews
i
passed
it
by
big
mistake
the
labeling
and
beer
names
may
be
jolly
and
jovial
but
this
is
serious
beer
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
a
beer
that
blew
me
away
la
roja
did
all
hail
jolly
pumpkin
astonishingly
nuanced
but
i
dont
think
this
is
for
everyone
and
after
thinking
about
the
suggestion
posed
to
me
i
agree
this
could
use
some
more
vigorous
carbonation
nonetheless
while
the
bourbon
intensity
isnt
for
me
this
is
an
extraordinarily
cool
beer
on
the
finish
volatile
sinusclearing
fumes
of
cracked
anise
pepper
cumin
and
rye
explode
from
the
back
to
add
an
odd
tragicomic
twist
to
this
beer
loaded
with
dualities
