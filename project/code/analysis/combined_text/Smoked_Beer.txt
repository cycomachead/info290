o
best
smoked
beer
ive
had
this
lives
up
to
its
reputation
get
some
at
all
chances
a
sample
courtesy
of
pablo
gracias
amigo
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
thick
tan
creamy
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
an
opaque
brown
black
aroma
is
smoke
and
malt
bit
of
fruit
flavors
like
malt
and
smoke
are
dominant
bittersweet
right
behind
along
with
tang
im
not
a
huge
smoke
beer
fan
so
subdued
smoke
is
more
my
speed
friends
like
it
much
more
than
me
finish
is
clean
true
and
a
little
on
the
short
side
not
bad
for
a
smokey
treat
o
while
smoked
beers
arent
close
to
being
my
favorite
style
i
gotta
say
this
is
a
fine
one
and
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
it
my
wife
liked
it
even
more
going
to
have
this
again
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
east
end
brews
anyways
its
smoked
alright
real
smoky
if
you
dont
like
rauchbiers
you
may
have
a
hard
time
with
this
and
a
liter
of
it
no
less
it
gets
a
little
smoother
as
it
warms
and
time
goes
on
but
its
pretty
one
dimensional
very
full
smoke
tones
to
it
though
for
a
smoked
beer
its
nice
a
bit
too
intense
to
go
back
to
but
that
might
be
because
this
style
isnt
my
absolute
favorite
to
note
i
went
back
to
this
24
hours
later
and
the
smoke
was
much
more
subdued
malt
body
was
nice
overall
porter
tones
were
good
pours
a
very
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
little
fizzy
light
tan
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
big
time
malty
with
some
nice
smokyroast

the
taste
is
very

this
one
is

a
tasty
little
brew
from
eebc
thanks
ben
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
i
loved
that
it
wasnt
shy
with
the
smokiness
but
not
overwhelming
either
it
was
very
smooth
but
had
some
very
bold
flavors
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
had
overall
great
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
balanced
was
worried
the
smoked
flavor
would
be
overboard
but
it
is
nice
and
mild
and
just
adds
to
a
great
porter
very
nicely
done
cant
wait
to
have
again
o
overall
this
was
pretty
good
the
smoke
didnt
dominate
like
i
expected
which
was
nice
not
my
first
choice
in
brew
but
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
features
and
excellent
use
of
smoke
great
balance
great
malt
backbone
definitely
worth
a
try
or
three
o
a
good
smoked
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
and
an
apparent
but
not
overdone
amount
of
smoke
just
cant
get
over
these
large
swingtops
from
east
end
good
times
indeed
this
one
pours
a
dark
garnetbrown
topped
by
plenty
o
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
maplesmoked
bacon
brown
sugar
molasses
maple
syrup
and
light
roasted
malts
the
taste
holds
notes
of
maple
syrup
light
molasses
light
hickory
smoke
brown
sugar
and
very
light
roasted
malts
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
syrupyish
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
one
that
doesnt
overdo
it
on
the
smoke
actually
i
almost
want
a
little
more
but
instead
balances
it
with
the
sweeter
and
more
portery
characteristics
right
on
traders
note
many
thanks
to
crazymacharris99
for
this
smoky
elixir
unique
is
a
good
word
to
describe
this
maybe
its
just
the
style
this
is
the
only
one
i
have
ever
had
of
this
but
i
was
really
put
off
by
this
it
tasted
like
an
ashtray
not
a
beer
very
smokey
but
smoke
as
in
cigar
smoke
not
malty
smoke
no
hopmalt
flavor
or
taste
not
worth
it
well
crafted
beer
d
highly
palatable
highly
drinkable
this
was
accomplished
by
making
the
smoke
just
one
of
the
elements
instead
of
the
element
which
is
something
most
smoked
beers
could
learn
from
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nose
that
is
simply
phenomenal
an
almost
perfect
balance
between
smokiness
roasted
malts
and
unsweetened
chocolate
well
worth
a
shot
d
very
good
brew
comparable
to
yazoos
sue
im
really
glad
sammy
suggested
that
i
go
to
this
brewery
in
pittsburgh
to
pick
this
one
up
d
this
is
sort
of
like
beef
jerky
meets
beer
and
for
some
reason
i
like
it
in
small
doses
that
said
i
dont
think
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
this
poured
a
very
dark
syrup
brown
with
a
half
finger
head
and
left
good
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
very
nice
smoky
aroma
with
roastiness
from
the
malts
and
faint
chocolate
notes
as
well
the
flavor
is
all
smoke
with
a
good
amount
of
roastiness
and
slight
chocolate
accents
but
mostly
smoke
that
was
not
over
the
top
it
was
well
balanced
in
the
brew
the
beer
was
medium
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
mild
roastiness
and
a
great
smoke
finish
very
drinkable
beer
that
makes
me
wanna
seek
out
some
more
smoked
beer
i
hope
i
can
get
this
stuff
again
lovely
stuff
thanks
for
bringing
ken
very
dark
brown
with
a
big
bubbly
light
brown
head
some
creamy
lace
delicious
aromas
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
understated
carbonation
a
balanced
smokey
tastecould
be
a
bit
bolder
with
a
lot
of
roastiness
in
the
finish
drinkable
for
the
style
a
very
solid
smoked
beer
east
end
has
been
pretty
legit
from
what
ive
seen
from
them
so
far
d
easy
drinking
and
different
enough
that
you
would
go
for
another
4
0
d
i
like
this
a
lot
i
wish
i
would
have
had
more
of
this
when
it
was
fresh
oh
well
i
have
a
damn
good
porter
in
my
cellar
pours
a
nice
dark
cola
color
with
no
light
escaping
the
head
is
white
to
slightly
off
white
with
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
smoke
nice
charcol
bbq
smell
the
taste
is
of
smoke
and
charcol
with
a
nice
bbq
flavor
a
slight
meaty
taste
is
present
in
the
middle
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
low
carbonated
overall
its
drinkable
but
you
would
have
to
like
the
style
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
you
could
easily
drink
these
if
you
like
the
style
f
loooong
lingering
smoke
flavor
that
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
constantly
eating
bacon
or
drying
your
mouth
over
a
bbq
pit
its
pretty
dry
too
to
go
a
long
with
it
lingering
smoked
meat
flavors
a
little
creamy
porter
flavors
and
some
bitterness
come
through
late
with
the
heavy
smoke
and
dryness
it
was
a
little
tough
to
get
more
than
a
couple
sips
down
though
d
great
beer
i
would
gladly
pay
the
price
they
ask
for
this
bottle
over
and
over
again
it
was
executed
perfectly
and
i
am
proud
to
know
the
brewery
is
in
the
great
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
very
drinkable
will
be
heading
back
for
a
refill
in
all
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
exactly
what
a
smoked
porter
should
be
i
was
happy
to
be
sharing
the
bottle
as
i
dont
think
i
could
knock
back
more
than
one
but
it
is
a
great
take
on
the
style
and
a
good
option
if
youre
looking
for
a
change
from
more
traditional
ipas
stouts
and
lagers
d
really
tasty
smokiness
is
wellconceived
and
executed
perfectly
for
my
tastes
at
the
dock
sale
i
toted
this
bottle
with
me
rather
than
leave
it
at
the
communal
tasting
table
i
did
this
in
part
because
i
wanted
to
keep
the
cool
bottle
and
because
i
wanted
to
share
it
with
my
friends
and
those
who
asked
and
in
all
honesty
so
that
i
could
enjoy
another
2
or
3
small
pours
before
seeing
this
one
go
away
a
very
good
beer
that
id
love
to
have
again
many
thanks
hart
clutch
your
loved
one
and
whisper
in
her
ear
there
are
few
times
in
life
more
content
than
this
enjoy
the
moment
while
nothing
spectacular
this
is
an
easy
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
porter
from
east
end
brewing
i
drank
the
rest
of
the
bottle
a
day
after
opening
it
and
if
anything
it
might
have
been
a
bit
better
the
next
day
in
any
event
this
is
a
nice
enough
smoked
porter
from
east
end
while
im
having
no
trouble
finishing
my
glass
i
cant
help
but
think
that
this
could
be
a
more
memorable
beer
bottom
line
this
is
a
smokey
tasty
american
beer
drinks
easy
enough
the
abv
is
well
hidden
needs
a
bit
more
malt
depth
flavor
to
really
hold
my
interest
past
a
few
pints
probably
enjoyed
the
artwork
on
the
label
as
much
as
the
beer
the
appearance
drags
this
down
but
i
still
wouldnt
put
it
up
there
with
alaskan
smoked
porter
robs
bottom
line
you
like
smoke
you
like
dark
if
you
like
either
you
wont
be
disappointed
you
like
both
youre
in
for
a
treat
go
get
some
an
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
especially
if
you
like
the
style
d
by
the
end
the
smoke
slows
you
down
the
flavor
doesnt
languish
but
it
is
an
assault
on
the
tongue
smokestack
came
to
me
with
a
black
look
and
some
browns
around
the
edges
a
dark
tan
inch
head
stayed
on
top
and
held
its
weight
decent
lacing
on
this
thinking
this
was
a
str8
porter
i
was
put
off
by
the
smoke
in
the
nose
but
got
use
to
it
the
smoke
is
followed
with
rich
malts
and
light
coffee
in
taste
the
smoke
is
not
heavy
but
not
light
a
big
malt
addition
gives
off
bread
and
some
sweetness
burnt
coffee
in
there
as
well
porter
flavors
come
through
with
some
chocolate
heritage
is
above
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
creamy
feel
and
some
carb
i
enjoyed
how
it
felt
besides
the
smoky
aftertaste
smoked
beers
are
not
my
thing
but
i
found
this
enjoyable
not
to
high
in
alcohol
either
another
nicely
done
beer
here
from
east
end
just
the
right
amount
of
smoke
was
present
and
the
roasty
porter
flavors
of
this
were
right
on
id
love
to
see
scott
do
a
nice
english
style
porter
as
part
of
the
session
ale
series
reviewed
on
06052009
bottle
shared
at
pprbsg09
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
smoked
meats
the
flavor
is
nice
and
smokey
very
tasty
this
beer
is
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
but
overall
i
found
it
enjoyable
d
pretty
good
for
the
style
lots
of
smoke
packed
into
this
bottle
i
love
what
eastend
does
overall
very
enjoyable
for
my
first
cask
beer
despite
being
a
bit
warm
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
smokey
beers
but
this
one
was
pretty
enjoyable
and
seemed
to
benefit
from
the
cask
this
is
a
goodgreat
smoked
beer
with
a
smoked
character
that
doesnt
overpower
and
is
complimented
by
the
sweet
malts
extremely
drinkable
for
the
style
m
d
the
bigger
body
complements
the
smoke
flavour
alright
in
a
way
i
didnt
think
i
would
carbonation
is
a
bit
lighter
well
its
all
more
like
a
porter
imagine
that
another
one
of
these
brews
where
the
abv
isnt
well
known
but
it
seems
like
it
might
be
a
bit
hefty
drinkability
no
clue
what
the
abv
on
this
one
was
but
its
really
not
that
hardcore
as
not
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
vegetarian
and
all
i
like
this
one
a
lot
the
aroma
was
incredibly
meaty
but
the
taste
was
very
well
integrated
and
nothing
was
too
intense
or
too
meaty
in
the
flavor
profile
this
one
comes
with
a
hey
you
know
i
dont
like
this
style
but
im
still
gonna
recommend
it
recommendation
d
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
chocolate
somke
roast
and
some
nuttiness
tastes
of
chocolate
somke
roasty
and
nutty
on
the
slightly
sweeter
side
i
have
a
1
liter
of
this
and
am
curious
to
see
how
it
compares
another
winner
for
east
end
looking
to
get
my
hands
on
toaster
now
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
a
liter
bottle
of
i
cant
be
happier
with
the
two
beers
i
have
had
from
east
end
and
to
be
honest
i
dont
see
how
they
can
get
any
better
than
this
someone
prove
me
wrong
just
a
great
beer
full
of
flavor
yet
quaffable
enough
to
enjoy
a
couple
glass
over
an
evening
the
smoke
really
is
at
a
perfect
level
here
tons
of
rich
malt
character
is
still
able
to
come
through
while
the
smoke
character
just
boosts
the
flavor
and
richness
of
this
beer
some
burnt
caramel
malts
a
really
smokey
flavor
produced
by
oak
aging
and
burnt
malts
that
really
accentuate
the
smokiness
involved
here
really
creamy
for
a
porter
some
sweet
chocolate
taste
really
plays
nicely
with
this
interesting
take
on
the
style
as
for
drinkability
i
hope
they
have
some
more
when
i
go
down
next
because
this
bottle
wont
last
long
this
one
is
really
drinkable
i
finished
the
entire
liter
with
only
a
few
odd
sips
taken
by
other
people
and
i
still
would
have
drank
more
another
winner
by
east
end
d
very
drinkable
the
smoke
is
great
in
the
nose
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
this
is
another
winner
from
scott
at
east
end
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
with
the
slightest
ruby
colors
and
a
small
white
head
that

some
smoke
and
some
roasted
malt
taste
follows
the
nose
nice
smoke
flavor
without
being
incredibly
heavy
or
overpowering
roasted
malts
are
present
but
dont
overpower
by
any
means
almost
no
hop
bitterness
at
all
aftertaste
lingers
mouthfeel
is
refreshingly
thin
for
a
smoked
porter
i
prefer
them
to
be
a
little
more
viscous
but
this
is
thin
in
a
good
way
very
easy
to
drink
unquestionably
the
most
drinkable
smoked
porter
i
have
ever
had
that
still
has
some
good
solid
smoke
flavor
in
it
although
i
do
prefer
alaskan
by
a
nose
this
is
a
defenite
good
one
from
scott
pick
it
up
if
you
can
still
find
some

offering
i
bought
three
bottles
of
this
limited
ru
brew
and
didnt
have
the
selfcontrol
to
save
even
one
to
cellar
scott
and
richard
did
good
with
this
one
incredible
smokey
aroma
and
very
powerful
smokey
finish
to
the
taste
dark
as
a
stout
and
a
nice
brownish
head
that
was
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
rinse
out
of
my
glass
in
my
opinion
better
than
this
years2007
alaskan
smoked
porterwhich
i
feel
is
usualy
the
smoked
porter
gold
standard
i
hope
the
fellas
at
east
end
make
this
a
yearily
thing
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
excellent
smoked
porter
can
easily
compete
with
the
other
great
beers
of
this
style
alaskan
and
stone
this
is
excellent
i
want
more
the
only
time
id
ever
had
a
smoked
beer
was
out
on
a
business
trip
to
spokane
wa
id
been
looking
for
more
to
try
but
wasnt
having
very
much
luck
fortunately
on
a
whim
while
i
was
in
pittsburgh
i
stopped
in
the
east
end
brewing
building
and
found
this
a
very
good
smoked
porter
its
appearance
is
nice
about
like
any
porter
youd
see
and
it
goes
down
smooth
the
smoked
smell
is
very
nice
and
was
just
what
i
was
looking
for
its
taste
is
very
good
as
well
a
wonderful
porter
with
a
nice
smoky
flavor
large
flip
top
bottle
bought
at
the
brewery
for
15
and
sampled
among
friends
at
city
beer
store
in
san
francisco
very
dark
beer
with
minimal
head
pours
into
the
pint
glass
though
some
bubbling
lace
remains
throughout
the
experience
aroma
does
not
smell
like
a
porter
at
all
it
smells
like
a
meat
house
i
mean
i
may
as
well
be
wearing
a
mask
of
pastrami
and
this
is
all
said
in
the
best
way
possible
the
smoked
malts
are
all
there
are
and
they
smell
delicious
the
taste
is
just
as
meaty
like
chewing
on
jerky
in
a
good
way
though
there
seems
to
be
lacking
much
more
character
than
what
the
smoked
malts
bring
to
the
table
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
and
under
carbonated
and
i
refuse
to
blame
this
on
the
fliptop
bottle
however
this
is
the
smokiest
best
rauchbier
ive
ever
had
and
i
want
more
now
damn
it
overall
this
was
excellent
and
i
am
very
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
it
was
very
unique
and
from
a
brewery
i
had
never
heard
of
but
apparently
they
are
doing
some
damn
fine
work
up
there
i
would
be
very
intrested
to
try
some
more
offerings
by
them
in
the
future
for
damn
sure
if
you
can
find
it
i
would
definatly
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
btw
he
loved
it
too
pours
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
smell
is
super
smoky
kind
of
like
a
backyard
bbq
with
pork
and
dominates
the
smell
with
other
sweet
characters
the
smell
is
great
and
very
inviting
the
taste
is
driven
by
the
smoke
and
tastes
great
other
sweet
flavors
come
through
but
that
bbq
taste
lingers
on
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
thick
as
i
would
have
thought
for
a
porter
but
is
smooth
and
fits
well
for
this
beer
this
one
is
a
great
drinking
beer
for
just
about
any
occasion
and
would
obviously
fit
well
for
most
backyard
gatherings
i
really
liked
this
one
thanks
to
melanoidin
for
getting
me
a
bottle
cheers
thanks
jasonm
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
i
really
like
it
but
i
can
see
this
being
over
the
top
for
some
mostly
smooth
and
balanced
for
a
porter
after
a
shift
at
bocktown
the
other
night
scott
smith
had
just
dropped
off
a
supply
of
this
newly
bottled
1
liter
swing
top
bottle
appears
a
deep
cola
brown
nearly
black
hue
forms
a
large
tan
head
leaves
behind
even
lace
with
each
sip
study
carbontion
flowing
as
visualized
with
a
stream
of
bubbles
aroma
is
great
other
than
alaskan
smoked
porter
this
is
the
closest
amount
of
smoked
meats
than
the
german
rauchbier
scherlenkerla
the
og
bamberg
beauty
peated
malt
smokiness
along
with
kilned
malts
blended
to
provide
smoked
pork
and
herbal
earthy
smokiness
dark
choclate
and
ehrbal
hop
bursts
are
muted
by
the
smoke
but
are
still
detectable
and
pleasant
to
my
senses
flavors
more
liquid
smoke
im
sorry
but
i
love
when
i
beer
can
taste
like
peppered
smoked
bacon
more
dark
roasts
provide
ample
bitterness
alongside
green
herbal
fresh
hop
accents
the
peated
malt
brings
out
some
whiskey
esque
earthiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fuller
body
carbonation
flows
smooth
and
the
finish
is
bone
dry
here
im
guessing
its
that
smokey
character
that
pulls
that
sensation
off
drinkabillity
another
world
class
offering
an
awesome
smoked
porter
brewed
in
the
burgh
keep
up
the
creativity
because
its
bold
to
put
something
like
this
out
there
not
everybody
can
get
down
with
the
smoked
beers
for
me
i
craved
more
after
finishing
a
pint
and
i
had
no
problem
enjoying
every
drop
great
drinkable
smoked
porter
d
an
extremely
wellcrafted
porter
even
without
the
smoke
aspect
which
just
takes
it
to
a
new
dimension
not
sure
what
the
alcohol
percentage
is
but
i
dont
image
its
over
6
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
poured
into
teku
glass
very
aggressively
moderate
head
which
dissipates
quite
quickly
leaving
some
lacings
this
thing
is
pitch
black
no
reflexes
even
when
put
in
front
of
a
lightbulb
smells
like
smoked
bacon
hiding
black
olives
some
medicinal
notes
and
dark
caramel
tastes
like
it
smells
with
slightly
bitter
and
long
aftertaste
where
the
smokiness
is
rising
up
again
at
the
very
finish
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
syrupy
in
a
pleasant
way
never
had
one
of
this
style
before
but
overall
quite
an
interesting
experience
though
also
a
bit
awkward
pours
a
healthy
two
finger
head
of
dark
tan
foam
delicate
in
appearance
almost
all
microfoam
with
a
mottled
surface
the
liquid
is
a
rich
brown
hue
opaque
although
you
can
see
a
great
deal
of
hyperactive
tiny
bubbles
rushing
towards
the
surface
the
nose
is
as
advertised
huge
smokiness
peaty
with
a
saline
quality
as
well
as
gaminess
old
school
plastic
bandaids
there
are
some
chocolaty
notes
all
of
the
above
wipes
out
any
fruit
which
might
be
there
general
pungency
lasts
for
some
time
mediumbodied
creamier
texture
than
expected
the
smokiness
prevents
excess
sweetness
from
building
and
also
aids
in
gluing
it
to
your
palate
charred
campfire
wood
grill
fat
tar
more
peat
than
straightup
earthiness
the
carbonation
is
as
strong
as
the
visuals
suggest
this
helping
to
relieve
some
monotony
more
chocolate
caramel
coming
though
here
perhaps
moments
of
plum
and
oddly
apricot
releases
well
and
does
not
force
itself
on
you
for
its
category
not
heavy
handed
given
its
relative
intensity
and
higher
alcohol
this
is
one
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
if
only
it
wasnt
so
sweet
instead
leaving
more
space
for
the
smoked
malts
to
shine
this
wouldve
been
a
real
gem
pity
dark
almost
no
head
smells
super
smoky
like
a
german
rauchbier
tastes
like
smoked
bacon
and
maybe
chocolate
tasty
body
is
medium
surprisingly
drinkable
o
most
if
not
all
of
de
molen
dark
ales
have
pretty
much
the
exact
same
flavor
profile
just
kissed
with
a
aura
of
whatever
adjunct
added
or
barrel
aged
in
not
knockin
them
whatever
base
beer
they
brew
here
is
killer
some
really
pop
others
are
just
good
i
dont
know
why
they
file
this
under
germanstyle
doesnt
taste
like
anything
from
germany
ive
had
regardless
the
mixture
of
peat
and
beechwoodsmoke
malts
clashes
a
bit
doesnt
really
add
any
dimension
to
the
beer
still
a
fine
sipper
though
bottled
52212
definitely
a
scotchy
smokey
smell
to
it
and
maybe
some
port
wine
or
grape
to
a
lesser
extent
sweet
up
front
followed
by
some
grapeor
maybe
some
sort
of
berrytype
flavor
smoke
just
a
tiny
bit
later
with
a
hint
of
slight
bitterness
aftertaste
is
a
bit
like
ash
or
salami
earthy
smoky
and
splendid
i
loved
this
beer
the
smoke
characteristics
are
upfront
yet
not
overboard
smooth
drinking
maltforward
beer
with
a
definite
smoke
and
alcohol
background
nicely
balanced
overall
not
overly
complex
compared
to
a
schlenkerla
variety
of
a
rauchbier
but
unmistakably
a
very
good
example
of
the
smoked
beer
art
pours
very
dark
brown
looks
cloudy
but
its
hard
to
tell
head
is
smallish
and
beige
fades
pretty
quickly
little
to
no
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
lot
more
smoke
than
expected
otherwise
theres
a
rich
caramelmolasses
malt
sweetness
with
some
chocolate
and
oak
a
touch
of
grapes
and
plums
smoke
is
the
star
though
little
roast
lots
more
smoke
in
the
taste
pretty
similar
to
the
aroma
in
other
respects
as
well
moderately
sweet
its
a
bit
meaty
with
some
dark
malt
fruitiness
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
some
tannic
oakiness
dries
things
out
mouthfeel
isnt
quite
as
full
as
id
like
for
the
flavors
its
not
thin
it
just
could
use
a
creamier
feel
as
a
backdrop
for
the
flavors
carbonation
is
relatively
low
decent
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
as
particularly
good
though
the
smoke
flavor
is
nice
but
kinda
takes
over
the
other
flavors
are
too
far
in
the
background
o
the
beer
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
and
the
smokey
flavors
do
not
overpower
the
taste
d
really
nice
smoked
beer
with
good
smoke
flavor
that
is
not
overpowering
overall
this
is
a
weird
one
its
pretty
good
though
as
long
as
you
arent
turned
off
by
the
smoked
hamness
not
a
bad
brew
but
for
the
money
go
with
a
german
smoked
beer
or
alaskan
i
dont
believe
i
got
the
bruichladdich
edition
but
i
wouldnt
really
know
anyway
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
dark
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
bacony
smoke
light
bandaid
light
roasted
malts
in
the
background
and
a
vague
sense
of
molasses
the
taste
really
ups
the
bandaid
ante
with
its
smoke
component
with
the
dry
biscuit
ad
very
light
roasted
malts
unable
to
do
much
to
assuage
my
tastebuds
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
verging
on
almostwatery
feel
overall
this
beer
just
didnt
work
for
me
i
believe
the
peated
malt
just
did
too
much
and
didnt
quite
gel
with
either
the
beechsmoked
malts
or
the
regular
malts
surrounding
it
one
things
for
sure
it
didnt
gel
with
my
sensibilities
much
pours
a
deep
maple
with
a
shade
of
grey
beneath
a
slightly
off
white
creamy
head
the
most
prominent
aroma
of
course
is
the
leatherysmoke
quality
which
overwhelms
your
senses
in
the
best
way
possible
notes
of
creamy
milk
chocolate
caramel
along
with
some
oak
as
well
although
the
smoke
is
the
main
player
in
flavor
as
well
the
darker
malt
flavors
are
initially
much
more
pronounced
not
quite
rich
but
it
does
add
some
depth
to
this
ale
hints
of
apple
and
grape
precede
a
slightly
dry
finish
with
more
leather
in
the
aftertaste
full
bodied
the
texture
certainly
distinguishes
this
one
from
a
lagered
rauchbier
much
fuller
and
rounded
a
really
nice
smoked
ale
that
i
would
recommend
especially
on
tap
on
account
of
its
added
smoothness
o
on
the
whole
a
solid
well
made
and
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
a
crazy
beer
ive
had
rauchbiers
and
lots
of
smoked
porters
and
plenty
of
islay
scotch
and
this
is
probably
the
most
intense
smoky
beverage
experience
ive
had
impressively
there
are
still
some
nice
flavors
under
the
smoke
but
its
still
superintensely
smokey
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
this
bottle
produced
a
ridiculous
amount
of
thick
beige
head
no
matter
how
carefully
it
was
poured
that
said
it
really
provided
quite
a
whiff
of
the
smokey
goodness
theres
lots
of
sweet
bacon
leather
on
the
nose
its
oddly
enticing
the
taste
however
is
unbelievable
doesnt
seem
like
it
would
work
but
the
dark
fruits
chocolate
and
smoke
flavours
are
balanced
and
integrated
with
a
lovely
bit
of
sweetness
that
is
gently
knocked
on
the
head
by
the
bitter
finish
so
complex
and
interesting
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
smoked

overall
this

the
only

is
the
rather
explosive
head
that
makes
pouring
this
beer
in

go
a
real
challenge
even
with
a
large
tulip
given
the
awkward
first
impressions
im
glad
i
powered
through
it
all
to
get
to
the
real
goods
a
pungent
chocolate
malt
offering
with
more
subtle
smoked
beer
leanings
making
it
a
much
more
drinkable
affair
than
initially
imagined
i
like
the
smokey
chocolate
notes
but
it
lacks
the
intensity
and
complexity
of
some
of
my
favorite
smoked
malt
ales
tasted
a
little
tame
to
me
nothing
really
jumped
out
and
wowed
me
here
like
some
other
de
molen
beers
overall
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
really
what
i
expected
from
a
smoked
beer
i
would
say
that
the
bamberg
malt
should
be
doubled
opens
up
into
a
very
decent
smoked
brown
ale
not
quite
schlenkerla
but
you
can
see
it
from
here
but
seems
like
a
lot
of
trouble
to
get
there
overall
great
balance
and
nice
smokiness
that
wasnt
over
the
top
but
there
just
enough
to
add
some
additional
complexity
o
loved
this
one
the
smokeyness
is
really
significant
and
i
would
liken
this
to
a
genuine
rauchbier
grows
on
me
big
thick
and
substantially
smokey
very
brown
colour
with
some
retained
head
the
malt
is
secondary
the
hops
are
there
and
subordinate
not
coughing
smoke
but
its
right
up
there
decent
drinkability
if
sipped
over
a
long
meal
thanks
luc
od
not
too
shabby
it
seemed
more
like
a
stout
when
i
was
drinking
it
not
too
sweet
mild
smoke
worth
a
shot
this
is
an
interesting
smoked
beer
i
cant
quite
make
up
my
mind
about
the
smoke
taste
i
stand
by
acrid
as
a
descriptor
but
i
waffled
between
hating
and
liking
it
worth
a
shot
d
smooth
and
very
drinkable
bottle
poured
dark
copper
with
light
haze
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
smoked
malt
is
dominant
and
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
also
a
solid
mix
between
a
lightly
sweet
malt
backbone
and
some
huge
peat
smoked
malt
with
some
extra
dry
smoke
also
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
about
average
with
ok
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
was
apparent
very
good
assembling
of
different
smoked
notes
and
i
am
sure
this
would
pair
well
with
smoked
gouda
though
i
didnt
have
any
a
nice
smoked
beer
here
which
is
different
to
some
of
the
smoked
beers
out
there
way
too
much
carbonation
great
apart
from
that
yeah
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
curious
flavours
done
well
finely
crafted
into
a
pleasant
beer
d
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
kind
of
weird
in
that
it
taste
smokey
and
sweet
not
my
favorite
smoked
beer
and
probably
wouldnt
order
it
again
jet
black
with
a
substantial
head
and
sufficient
lace
average
head
retention
apple
aroma
with
a
bit
of
smoke
fruity
sweetness
as
well
a
bit
of
carbonation
bite
up
front
this
fades
to
a
middle
that
has
apple
and
prune
sweetness
with
a
subtle
hint
of
smoke
back
end
is
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
and
noticeably
dry
medium
light
mouthfeel
not
your
ordinary
smoked
beer
and
the
smoke
characteristics
are
very
subdued
alcohol
sweetness
is
present
in
the
finish
this
is
a
really
damn
good
smoked
beer
probably
one
of
my
favourites
it
has
this
lovely
sweetness
to
connect
everything
but
the
delicate
smokiness
takes
the
lead
really
interesting
and
very
drinkable
d
cool
beer
it
would
go
great
with
bbq
glad
to
try
it
if
you
like
alaskan
smoked
porter
and
schlenkerla
rauchbier
you
have
to
try
this
almost
an
imaginary
blend
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
brew
and
i
may
revisit
it
just
to
make
up
my
mind
notes
this
has
less
of
the
porkbbq
smokey
taste
than
a
rauchbier
the
woodypeat
smoke
combines
with
some
more
vinous
and
tart
fruits
this
makes
for
an
interesting
flavor
although
i
would
say
i
slightly
prefer
the
bbq
type
of
smoke
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
really
worth
searching
for
drinkability
is
good
and
the
abv
is
wellhidden
overall
i
like
this
one
it
goes
down
quite
well

a

this
adds
a

on

of
the

which
is
not

but
does
give
an
extra
kick
if
i
am
not
mistaking
this

coffee
in
it
this
does
not
take
over
the
beer

adds
an

to
the

would
have
it

more

a

all
the

just
a

basically
a

which
is
quite
the
compliment
for
this
style
overall
nice
for
the
style
the
smoke
is
in
check
which
is
always
nice
and
the
beer
comes
through
thanks
again
sebd
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
pretty
good
beer
i
found
it
a
bit
more
potent
than
aecht
schlenkerla
which
has
sort
of
become
the
front
all
smoked
beers
are
now
based
on
for
me
anyways
whereas
i
found
aecht
sessionable
or
a
everyday
beer
this
was
a
bit
more
bold
but
non
the
less
an
astounding
beer
and
kudos
to
dieu
du
ciel
for
another
great
beer
d
a
decent
smoked
beer
id
drink
it
again
if
there
were
limited
options
available
but
i
can
think
of
plenty
of
smoked
beers
or
dieu
du
ciel
offerings
id
much
prefer
appreciate
the
lower
abv
on
tap
at
dieu
du
ciel
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
an
inch
of
frothy
head
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
campfire
smokey
malts
with
an
almost
meaty
smoke
aroma
kind
of
like
bacon
the
taste
is
of
the
smokey
malts
and
earth
burnt
leaves
and
a
campfire
dry
with
some
charred
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
and
thin
which
help
makes
this
brew
more
drinkable
considering
the
amount
of
smoke
flavor
i
love
this
style
of
beer
but
havent
been
able
to
find
many
really
good
ones
overall
this
is
the
best
rauchbier
i
have
ever
had
thus
far
mf
it
seems
that
i
have
ashes
in
my
mouth
but
surprisingly
its
good
overall
nice
stuff
the
taste
is
not
as
overwhelmingly
smokey
as
the
nose
suggests
still
pretty
intense
but
more
balanced
and
quite
enjoyable
if
you
like
smoke
you
get
a
ton
here
kind
of
takes
an
islay
malt
flavor
profile
on
if
you
dont
like
smoke
go
elsewhere
o
i
havent
had
many
rauch
style
beers
and
this
was
very
enjoyable
and
refreshingly
different
to
what
i
normally
drink
i
paired
this
with
pepperjack
cheese
and
it
was
nice
combo
pours
brown
and
clearish
with
a
light
tan
ring
that
doesnt
last
smells
of
smoky
meat
and
bbq
the
body
begins
with
a
very
bbq
finish
with
burnt
meat
notes
in
it
lingers
with
bacon
no
perceptible
bitterness
but
the
smoke
lasts
forever
on
the
palate
i
could
imagine
enjoying
this
beer
with
a
good
pulled
pork
pours
a
dark
ruby
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
head
that
dissapates
to
leave
an
outer
rim
of
lacing
that
also
coats
the
sides
of
the
glassthe
smell
is
smoked
hamroasty
malts
and
a
touch
of
herbal
hopsthe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
smoked
maltsstonefruitsa
touch
of
cherrycaramel
and
is
finished
with
a
spicy
dryness
and
overall
this
is
a
nice
smoked
beer
that
lets
the
other
flavours
shine
through
but
for
me
i
like
a
little
more
smoke
and
in
saying
that
this
would
be
a
nice
crossover
for
the
person
who
doesnt
like
a
full
smokey
sb
cheers
got
nothing
on
aecht
schlenkerla
but
nice
stuff
none
the
less
a
really
nice
rauchbier
obviously
this
style
isnt
to
everyones
taste
but
i
think
it
works
really
well
and
is
a
delicious
example
of
the
style
pours
a
deep
violetburgundy
creamy
offwhite
cap
that
laces
well
nose
is
a
rich
meaty
and
woody
smokiness
with
some
faint
underlying
sweetness
taste
is
a
slight
change
of
pace
as
smoke
and
rich
caramel
notes
present
themselves
in
unison
taking
turns
presenting
themselves
on
the
palate
great
malt
flavour
smooth
mouthfeel
with
moderate
lingering
smoke
and
caramel
sweetness
heavy
medium
in
body
and
a
lower
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
solid
if
on
the
sweeter
side
smoked
offering
excellent
taste
too
peaty
smoky
but
not
overpowering
not
caustic
in
the
throat
sweet
malt
fades
into
the
smoke
leaving
a
pleasant
smoky
aftertaste
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
first
time
ive
had
it
and
with
the
year
on
it
its
really
held
up
well
now
to
seek
it
out
fresh
the
new
chore
upon
me
picked
this
up
on
a
trip
to
montreal
completely
different
beer
now
from
the
frist
time
i
had
it
the
beer
is
almost
porterlike
in
how
dark
it
is
it
has
a
nice
dense
white
head
which
lingers
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
this
beer
smells
like
eating
bacon
and
beef
jerky
at
a
campfire
there
is
a
little
bit
of
grainyness
and
nuttiness
but
really
it
is
all
about
the
smoke
here
the
taste
just
has
more
and
more
hickory
bacon
smokiness
with
a
mild
nutty
sweetness
to
lend
a
bit
of
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
is
also
lacking
a
bit
of
carbonation
would
definitely
benefit
from
a
bit
more
overall
this
beer
is
an
experience
more
than
anything
else
huge
smokiness
when
fresh
i
would
love
to
see
something
like
this
as
a
bigger
beer
but
i
would
be
afraid
i
couldnt
handle
any
more
smoke
pours
lightly
smokey
yellow
with
lasting
threeeighths
of
an
inch
lasting
head
slightly
smokey
aroma
very
good
taste
with
controlled
smoked
malt
and
a
sweet
spicey
finish
that
satisfies
average
mouthfeel
smooth
very
drinkable
a
lovely
smoked
beer
thanks
luc
ddc
would
sit
comfortably
in
my
top
8
canadian
breweries
but
this
beer
doesnt
do
much
for
its
position
there
it
seems
to
be
one
of
those
cases
where
a
great
beer
was
turned
into
a
good
beer
by
lacking
in
just
one
aspect
the
mouthfeel
if
making
a
fuller
body
entails
increasing
the
alcohol
content
id
say
its
more
than
worth
it
this
ones
worth
a
try
but
cant
contend
with
many
other
ddc
offerings
pours
a
light
brown
colour
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
some
mild
lacing
around
the
glass
nice
head
retention
until
the
end
smells
of
campfirechimney
smoke
with
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
this
seems
to
be
a
smoked
porter
or
at
least
similar
enough
to
that
very
smooth
carbonation
level
a
nice
beer
and
anyone
that
likes
smokey
beers
should
try
this
overall
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
is
extremely
drinkable
i
had
no
issues
with
putting
this
one
down
quickly
and
easily
a
clean
and
crisp
finish
makes
the
charbonniere
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
would
pair
perfectly
with
anything
off
the
grill
or
even
a
smooth
cigar
definitely
couldnt
slam
a
smoked
beer
at
the
best
of
times
this
is
okay
but
drinkable
is
not
the
word
that
springs
to
mind
a
really
wonderful
smoked
beer
full
of
flavour
and
very
classic
pour
out
a
clear
brown
with
an
off
white
head
smelled
like
smoked
bacon
salami
and
caramel
malts
the
taste
as
packed
with
a
huge
smoked
meat
taste
very
smooth
and
not
overpowering
though
the
flavor
lasted
a
while
after
you
swallowed
and
you
get
a
nice
integration
of
a
campfire
flavor
and
brown
malts
i
wish
this
beer
wasnt
so
thin
i
wouldve
liked
it
to
have
some
more
body
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
had
and
im
not
a
very
big
fan
of
the
style
drink
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
but
not
my
sort
of
thing
points
for
originality
but
lacks
drinkability
1
is
more
than
enough
i
have
to
give
it
credit
by
saying
that
they
tackled
this
beer
really
well
for
what
it
is
its
damn
close
to
being
really
good
but
falls
just
a
tad
short
overall
a
nice
smoke
beer
god
spice
as
well
this
was
my
first
from
dieu
du
ciel
and
i
was
overall
impressed
i
would
much
prefer
this
to
the
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
which
is
a
little
too
overwhelming
to
enjoy
an
entire
bottle
of
however
the
smokiness
is
still
very
much
more
pronounced
than
something
like
stones
smoked
porter
or
other
beers
where
the
smoke
flavor
is
just
an
addition
opposed
to
the
centerpiece
would
only
recommend
to
those
familiar
with
rauchbiers
but
because
of
its
mildness
serves
as
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
style
d
this
definitely
takes
a
different
approach
on
the
style
its
much
easier
to
drink
than
the
other
because
its
not
as
strong
but
i
feel
like
its
a
little
to
weak
good
beer
to
try
but
nothing
else
not
bad
at
all
and
a
nice
pairing
with
our
food
its
certainly
very
drinkable
for
a
fairly
onedimensional
beer
very
well
integrated
smoke
doesnt
overwhelm
like
some
helped
out
by
a
nice
grassy
minerally
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
when
paired
with
the
malt
base
almost
reminds
me
of
an
alt
smoke
a
little
thin
in
the
body
but
the
lack
of
heft
makes
this
more
of
a
plain
ol
drinker
especially
with
the
well
integrated
smoke
would
gladly
drink
it
again
paired
well
with
bbq
thanks
robbo
this
could
be
even
more
drinkable
than
aecht
schlenkerla
in
spite
of
being
a
lesser
beer
overall
especially
drinkable
as
a
smoked
beer
i
could
session
this
if
i
felt
like
something
smoky
this
would
actually
be
great
to
drink
a
bunch
of
while
sitting
around
a
fire
on
a
cool
summer
evening
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
smoked
wood
with
caramel
malt
in
the
background
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
deep
smoky
notes
and
smoked
salmon
with
some
lightly
sweet
caramel
malt
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
very
well
done
with
nice
balance
between
the
smoke
and
the
malt
bill
poured
into
my
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
this
is
a
slightly
reddish
dark
brown
beer
with
a
reasonable
head
what
you
really
notice
is
the
intense
smoky
nose
that
grabs
your
attention
the
beer
is
a
solid
ale
with
all
sorts
of
smoked
malt
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
smoke
lingers
on
your
tongue
great
beer
as
i
love
smoked
beer
and
cheese
goes
well
with
morrocan
lamb
stew
thanks
hoser
for
this
one
and
the
glass
i
poured
it
in
to
for
that
matter
my
only
regret
with
this
beer
is
i
have
no
bbq
to
pair
with
it
and
no
campfire
to
hypnotize
me
while
i
drink
it
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
wont
trash
it
i
suspect
that
those
who
like
bitter
smokey
beers
will
love
this
im
just
not
sure
im
one
of
them
overall
im
not
usually
attracted
to
smoke
beer
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
really
good
and
would
recommend
it
if
you
can
handle
a
moderate
smoky
presence
dark
color
beer
it
is
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
head
on
top
as
usual
with
this
brewery
the
head
stick
well
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
smoked
wow
i
like
this
i
get
some
bacon
in
there
too
no
hops
on
the
taste
side
it
is
smoked
again
everywhere
from
start
to
finish
more
like
a
smoked
wood
than
bacon
however
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
a
bitterness
in
the
end
however
it
is
not
strong
one
good
thing
is
the
taste
lingers
in
the
mouth
for
a
good
amount
of
time
we
note
also
the
carbonation
in
the
mouth
a
good
smoked
beer
very
interesting
overall
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
best
use
would
be
as
an
accompaniment
for
food
such
as
stew
or
chili
better
yet
as
an
additive
for
making
food
such
as
part
of
a
marinade
for
the
grill
or
as
part
of
a
stir
fry
which
i
used
it
in
this
evening
edit
since
my
review
ive
downed
a
four
pack
of
this
and
am
really
starting
to
enjoy
it
i
never
wanted
to
buy
smoked
beers
before
and
i
just
might
be
starting
a
craving
for
them
this
is
good
beer
im
not
entirely
sure
why
this
isnt
classified
as
a
rauchbier
as
the
otherwise
heady
maltiness
is
quite
thoroughly
overshadowed
by
the
ingrained
meaty
smokiness
does
it
have
something
to
do
with
protected
place
names
or
some
other
such
nonsense
this
starts
off
malt
but
goes
to
all
smoke
quickly
good
body
with
a
relatively
low
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
thatll
grow
on
you

i
wias
looking
forward
to
this
one
standard
amber
colour
with
good
clarity
and
white
head
you
can
definitely
pick
up
the
wisp
of
smoke
in
the
nose
just
like
a
recently
snuffed
out
campfire
taste
is
more
moderate
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
smoke
is
definitely
there
but
not
in
your
face
or
harsh
i
dont
pick
up
much
in
the
hop
department
just
a
mildly
smokey
easy
driking
amber
ale
would
have
been
nice
to
spend
more
time
there
and
settle
into
a
couple
of
these
tastw
wise
the
smoked
flavours
hits
you
but
are
quite
balanced
betweem
the
smokiness
hops
and
yeasty
spicy
flavours
shy
bbq
flavours
such
as
hickory
well
balanced
d
an
approachable
smoked
beer
taste
the
smoke
factor
is
spread
out
very
well
on
the
palate
it
hits
you
solidly
at
first
balances
out
in
the
middle
with
a
very
solid
malt
structure
and
finishes
long
with
hickory
traces
they
should
brew
this
more
often

that
doesnt

youre
going

spices
forest
as
the
commercial
description
says
the
smoky
taste
is
quite
dominant
at
each
new
draught
wed
regret
the
smoky
taste
for
long
if
itd
ever
quit
the
mouth
and
while
its
so
longlasting
it
remains
comfortable
and
light
with
slight
hints
of
salmon
in
the
finish
this
remains
rather
retrained
for
the
smoke
lover
i
am
and
imo
not
exactly
dieu

best
take
at
the
famous
bamberg
style
edit
had
a
pint
at
the
brewpub
everything
i
said
last
year
stands
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
record
ive
had
rauchbier
in
bamberg
that
wasnt
as
smoky
or
half
as
tasty
as
this
twas
the
spezial
the
smoked
malt
was
also
prominent
in
the
taste
but
not
overpowering
possibly
a
hint
of
smoked
ham
as
well
and
i
mean
that
in
a
nice
way
this
beer
was
not
overpowering
in
its
smokey
maltiness
but
rather
it
was
nicely
balanced
and
offered
a
good
smoked
beer
in
a
lighter
easier
drinking
fashion
a
nice
woodiness
in
the
finish
a
rare
smoked
beer
in
canada
smoke
and
toasted
hints
in
aroma
from
a
very
light
colored
beer
as
far
as
most
smoked
beers
go
smoke
flavors
are
balanced
by
a
pleasant
malt
sweetness
the
smoke
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
very
good
but
hard
to
find
opleasant
smoke
ale
with
light
balance
the
smoke
flavor
isnt
overwhelming
and
id
prefer
more
of
it
also
more
carbonation
overall
a
nice
smoked
beer
solid
flavor
ideal
for
a
smokey
bbq
outdoors
would
go
great
with
roasted
pork
half
a
finger
white
head
clear
light
orangish
amber
body
a
few
streams
of
bubbles
rising
to
surface
good
lacing
mild
smoke
aromas
a
bit
sweet
balanced
by
floral
hops
pretty
subtle
smokewise
the
smoke
comes
through
taste
wise
beechwood
predominates
fairly
sweet
complex
smokiness
though
no
ashtray
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
decent
effervescence
along
with
caldera
ur
bock
one
of
the
pnw
better
smoked
beers
though
this
is
harder
than
hell
to
find
worth
a
try
this
smoked
ale
has
a
good
malt
body
with
light
woody
notes
and
a
nice
smokiness
which
gives
a
nice
complimet
to
the
slight
piney
element
from
the
hops
which
also
seem
to
go
well
with
the
yeast
which
is
mildly
fruity
there
is
a
subtle
caramel
and
wood
synergy
that
brings
the
smoke
forward
on
the
palate
yet
doesnt
go
to
far
either
i
really
enjoy
how
it
doesnt
get
too
sweet
either
overall
i
was
impressed
by
this
since
it
is
obviously
a
northwest
version
of
a
classic
rauchbier
it
doesnt
stick
the
style
completelyrogue
puts
its
own
stamp
on
the
style
and
it
is
very
pleasing
to
my
palate
with
just
the
right
amount
of
smoke
flavor
it
paired
well
with
the
pulled
pork
at
the
brewery
but
id
go
for
a
chipotle
if
i
did
it
again
a
simply
lightly
malty
ale
there
isnt
really
any
smoke
here
what
the
heck
smokeyflavored
with
a
bacon
finish
and
some
cinnamon
at
the
end
also
nutty
and
sweet
dry
finish
yes
with
the
bacon
too
dry
to
hold
up
a
delicious
smoke
level
dry
euro
hop
flavors
funky
the
hop
contribution
is
perhaps
the
classiest
element
of
the
beer
the
smoke
is
cool
d
very
drinkable
for
a
smoke
beer
the
flavors
play
nice
and
dont
overwhelm
your
palate
but
a
good
blend
overall
and
because
its
not
too
meaty
its
more
drinkable
than
many
rauchssmokeds
ive
had
o
a
smoke
ale
it
is
what
it
is
drinkability
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
i
wouldnt
write
home
about
it
drinkable
but
not
fantastic
this
was
my
first
smoked
beer
and
it
was
alright
i
would
like
a
smaller
amount
of
it
to
actually
have
with
some
bbq
or
some
campfire
goodies
i
think
it
would
work
even
better
there
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
while
there
may
be
better
smoky
beers
out
there
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style

solid
enjoyable
beer
a
very
smoked
ale
balanced
and
thirst
quencher
easy
to
drink
d
extremely
good
for
this
style
smoked
beers
are
generally
rather
hard
to
put
down
so
this
one
is
exceptional
rogue
does
indeed
put
out
some
great
brews
and
this
one
is
of
no
exception
smokey
delicate
balanced
and
very
drinkable
i
can
see
the
parallels
drawn
between
this
type
of
beer
and
the
german
rauchbier
but
the
peaty
character
really
distinguishes
the
style
id
say
this
one
is
worth
picking
up
whether
you
are
a
fan
of
rogue
or
not
a
pleasant
balanced
wellmade
beer
as
is
usually
the
case
with
rogue
very
good
on
drinkability
though
im
a
bit
biased
when
it
comes
to
this
style
i
could
drink
it
all
night
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
found
myself
flying
through
my
22oz
the
hop
finish
does
nothing
but
make
me
want
to
go
back
for
another
gulp
i
could
drink
this
all
day
d
its
unique
it
would
be
paired
well
with
a
bloody
mary
one
of
the
lighter
smokes
ive
had
the
smokiness
on
the
flavor
is
unique
almost
cedary
maybe
the
beechwood
gives
it
that
characteristic
hops
are
definitely
in
here
more
than
most
smoked
beers
flavor
is
woody
and
the
malts
caramely
a
touch
toasty
and
certainly
sweet
unique
take
on
the
style
with
the
dose
of
saaz
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
the
combo
is
my
cup
o
tea
i
like
it
more
than
most
rogue
beers
but
far
from
my
favorite
rauchbier
rogue
smoke
ale
is
a
slightly
hazy
amber
ale
with
a
small
white
head
that
mostly
dissipates
and
leaves
solid
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
smokey
slightly
sweet
aroma
with
a
peaty
note
theres
something
like
beef
jerky
in
the
nose
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
finish
thats
kind
of
sharp
yeah
its
smokey
almost
like
barbeque
theres
a
tartness
from
the
malt
and
a
spicy
bitterness
going
on
too
so
its
not
just
the
smoke
going
on
its
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
its
well
balanced
its
an
interesting
and
engaging
beer
d
split
the
bomber
and
paired
it
with
wild
boar
bacon
the
beer
is
good
lets
hope
the
pizza
pairs
well
nice
beer
d
a
delicious
brew
that
is
well
worth
a
try
one
of
the
better
varieties
of
a
rare
style
this
is
my
first
smoked
ale
and
i
do
enjoy
it
although
i
can
see
why
others
do
not
enjoy
it
my
600th
review
how
about
that
poured
a
orangeish
body
with
a
good
head
that
died
slowly
and
left
some
lace
a
mix
of
light
smokeymeatiness
and
hints
of
sweet
caramel
malt
as
well
real
smooth
semicreamy
even
with
a
medium
body
that
passes
not
only
with
some
meatsmokiness
even
woody
but
with
some
sweetness
and
then
finishes
clean
with
a
minor
hoppy
bitterness
backbite
a
real
pleasant
beer
that
is
enjoyable
and
distinct
with
the
different
and
balanced
feels
to
it
glad
i
got
to
try
it
d
its
very
interesting
but
for
the
price
and
taste
i
could
not
buy
this
again
its
worth
trying
at
least
once
very
surprising
what
some
people
can
create
finally
every
other
place
was
out
of
this
poured
clear
amberbrown
with
a
minimal
white
head
rich
smoked
wood
and
bacon
nose
it
smells
like
a
justlit
campfire
with
a
solid
hop
backing
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
long
finish
taste
is
just
what
i
want
with
my
smoke
ales
strong
smoke
hearty
peaty
oaked
and
hopped
some
balance
with
the
malt
spicy
hop
finish
incredible
its
like
a
aecht
schlerenka
in
ale
form
i
could
drink
this
all
night
650ml
bomber
poured
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
thick
head
rapidly
disappears
smokey
campfire
aroma
is
very
apparent
taste
is
smoke
and
malt
with
some
hops
and
citrus
is
also
quite
dry
pretty
good
stuff
but
not
really
sessionable
drinkability
a
good
not
great
smoked
beer
i
will
look
for
this
again
but
one
bomber
is
enough
i
do
like
to
smoke
combined
with
the
hops
resinous
chewy
mouthfeel
with
a
very
roasted
smoked
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
charcoal
campfire
ash
barbecued
bacon
and
butane
as
well
as
a
crisp
dry
bitter
citrus
hop
presence
the
citrus
hops
sweeten
things
up
a
bit
and
provide
an
interesting
balance
to
the
smokey
flavor
watery
and
cloudy
brown
with
rapidly
disappearing
head
and
no
noticeable
lacing
aroma
of
frying
bacon
taste
is
gritty
smoky
but
a
bit
thin
on
body
not
much
malt
or
even
hop
flavor
maybe
its
hiding
brief
aftertaste
of
campfire
interesting
but
not
terribly
d
for
me
through
the
roof
i
love
a
good
smoked
beer
and
rogue
has
brought
its
heavy
guns
to
this
battle
i
am
impressed
and
find
this
to
be
almost
an
equal
to
the
schlenkerla
beers
which
is
about
the
highest
compliment
i
can
pay
any
smoked
beer
seek
this
one
out
cherish
it
and
bathe
in
it
if
you
must
a
worldclass
beer
as
far
as
smoke
beers
go
this
one
is
pretty
damn
tasty
the
smoke
isnt
overwhelming
but
one
can
certainly
taste
it
i
was
hoping
to
have
a
little
more
smoke
in
the
nose
though
finishes
dry
which
i
think
complements
the
smokiness
long
bitterness
in
the
plentiful
finish
a
sure
winner
in
the
smoke
department
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
rogues
ale
house
in
san
francisco
pint
glass
the
beer
is
somewhat
dark
brown
and
hazy
with
a
thin
white
film
of
foam
on
top
the
aroma
was
smoky
but
not
as
strong
as
id
expected
or
hoped
more
like
a
schlenkerla
beer
dialed
down
to
75
intensity
along
with
the
salami
smokiness
i
guess
id
say
this
was
more
malty
than
hoppy
somewhat
sweet
or
toasted
malts
the
taste
was
similar
toasted
malts
with
enough
smoked
flavor
to
keep
you
happy
if
you
like
that
style
of
beer
i
cant
say
i
tasted
much
of
the
hops
which
i
expected
based
on
rogues
decription
of
the
beer
anyway
this
is
a
good
smoke
beer
i
like
it
enough
that
ill
look
for
it
in
bottles
sometime
at
home
d
this
was
a
very
good
beer
my
first
smoked
beer
and
i
was
hooked
very
nice
and
rich
flavor
for
such
a
small
beer
d
i
was
quite
underwhelmed
by
this
one
it
is
far
from
the
original
german
smoked
beers
this
is
more
like
an
american
mildly
hoppy
beer
with
a
touch
of
smoke
to
it
its
to
clean
and
uncharismatic
i
give
this
puppy
good
marks
for
drinkability
extremely
interesting
beer
to
review
highly
encouraged
that
you
seek
one
out
a
nice
even
dose
of
smoke
after
having
a
few
of
those
scottish
peat
monsters
good
as
an
exposure
to
a
special
style
but
not
something
that
id
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
drinkability
moderate
drinkability
does
not
sit
heavy
but
i
personally
would
switch
to
something
else
after
having
a
couple
in
one
sitting
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thick
frothy
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
smoked
goodness
with
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malts
to
it
smokiness
is
not
overpowering
taste
is
of
toasted
malts
up
front
pale
malts
mixed
with
smoked
flavoring
take
the
middle
with
the
malts
at
the
forefront
finish
is
slightly
sweet
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
thick
creamy
feel
to
this
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
smoked
ale
to
sit
with
for
a
while
this
beer
pours
a
mahogany
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
headit
has
aromas
of
smokey
wood
and
a
very
distinct
hop
smell
which
overpowers
the
smoke
smellit
tastes
very
pleasant
i
was
abit
worried
about
not
liking
this
style
of
beer
but
i
actually
really
do
it
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
smoked
peatiness
with
fruity
hops
which
definately
balance
out
each
other
very
well
quite
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
recommend
and
suprisingly
enough
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
medium
at
best
making
for
a
smooth
body
drinkability
is
good
im
sure
id
tire
of
the
smoke
eventually
but
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
very
solid
beer
drinkability
its
enjoyable
a
pleasant
wellbalanced
beer
with
a
nice
level
of
everyday
smoke
character
d
one
bottle
was
both
nice
and
interesting
but
now
im
ready
to
drink
something
else
and
considering
the
high
price
im
probably
not
going
to
buy
this
beer
again
an
elegant
and
quite
conservative
smoked
ale
i
like
them
a
bit
more
aggressive
i
had
this
beer
a
couple
nights
ago
after
wanting
to
try
it
for
awhile
it
was
a
amberishhazy
beer
the
smell
wasnt
strong
on
the
smoke
but
it
smelled
more
like
a
pale
ale
the
taste
was
like
a
pale
ale
until
it
warmed
up
then
the
smoke
came
through
i
found
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
i
love
this
and
it
went
very
well
with
our
bbq
pork
smoked
another
winner
from
rogue
well
done
dnot
very
i
really
didnt
like
this
and
ended
up
saving
the
rest
to
use
as
a
marinade
glad
i
tried
this
i
was
curious
about
it
but
smoke
flavor
in
beer
is
just
not
my
thing
if
you
have
never
had
a
rauchbier
before
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
even
if
you
find
that
you
dont
care
for
them
you
will
still
be
able
to
finish
this
one
without
too
much
pain
nice
one
to
expand
your
palate
with
since
it
is
not
too
extreme
but
you
will
still
taste
the
smoke
then
you
can
decide
if
you
like
this
style
d
its
pretty
good
not
overly
smoked
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
smoked
beers
a
little
less
smoke
a
little
more
hops
d
absolutely
delicious
flavor
in
a
world
with
very
few
smoked
beers
this
is
a
welcome
for
people
like
me
fantastic
flavor
and
decent
alcohol
level
allows
for
a
few
of
these
my
only
disappointment
is
that
this
is
not
available
in
my
state
yet
a
great
beer
ill
look
for
this
one
again
very
good
brew
but
given
the
flavors
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
too
much
of
this
in
one
sitting
very
good
introduction
to
the
style
this
is
one
of
few
for
me
the
traditional
ale
characteristics
were
a
little
tough
to
find
for
me
amongst
the
smoky
character
overall
this
isnt
an
overly
intense
smoked
beer
and
is
one
that
is
worth
a
shot
the
astringency
knocks
the
drinkability
down
a
touch
but
this
is
still
a
pleasant
brew
full
of
flavour
but
not
too
intense
for
this
smoked
beer
n00b
i
can
certainly
see
having
this
sometime
with
barbecue
this
makes
me
crave
fresh
sausage
id
use
some
to
make
a
caraway
beer
mustard
d
you
might
not
like
it
if
you
dont
like
the
smell
of
smoke
or
the
taste
of
smoked
meat
but
why
are
you
trying
it
then
other
wise
delicious
like
the
beer
but
not
a
real
session
beer
imo
that
said
i
wish
this
style
of
beer
was
more
available
and
i
would
love
to
find
a
beer
in
this
style
that
is
even
more
intense
if
this
is
a
good
starter
smoked
beer
id
like
to
try
a
more
advanced
version
it
might
be
fun
to
revisit
this
every
now
and
then
though
the
aroma
was
smoked
fish
meat
smell
it
reminded
me
of
a
barbeque
throughout
the
drink
the
smoke
never
left
you
if
you
dont
like
smoked
foods
i
dont
think
you
would
like
this
one
there
was
a
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
is
a
well
balanced
beer
and
after
a
couple
of
sips
to
acclimate
yourself
it
was
wonderful
well
done
by
the
guys
on
the
coast
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
pillowy
white
head
the
aroma
is
pure
smoke
in
a
good
way
it
reminds
me
of
meat
over
a
smoker
the
smoke
flavor
is
up
front
but
not
over
the
top
the
finish
is
a
bit
sweet
the
bottle
states
it
is
a
hoppy
smoke
ale
i
do
not
taste
it
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
drinking
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
d
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
smokey
but
with
a
slightly
ceral
grain
and
almost
sweet
corny
taste
yes
the
almost
meaty
smokiness
and
woodiness
is
here
but
seems
a
bit
washed
out
slightly
sweet
and
again
a
slight
citric
hop
bitterness
in
fact
the
more
i
sip
on
this
the
less
smokey
it
seems
at
this
point
i
cant
really
tell
what
i
want
more
smoke
or
more
unaltered
malt
and
hop
flavors
being
s
smoked
beer
i
want
more
smoke
and
am
not
getting
it
right
now
i
like
some
things
that
are
going
on
here
it
is
very
well
balanced
has
a
good
solid
mouthfeel
and
has
a
solid
flavor
profile
but
the
lack
of
a
higher
smoke
content
leaves
me
wanted
just
a
bit
more
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
that
i
would
drop
nearly
7
dollars
on
on
a
regular
basis
a
good
beer
to
use
if
you
want
to
ease
yourself
into
the
world
of
smoked
beers
but
really
i
say
you
should
dive
right
in
and
get
it
over
with
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
fact
that
the
smokiness
is
so
pronounced
but
i
would
imagine
that
drank
in
combination
with
pulled
pork
or
a
barbecue
brisket
this
would
be
phenomenal
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
lots
of
carbonation
i
didnt
have
any
problem
finishing
the
bomber
but
drinkability
is
really
not
that
great
considering
the
style
watery
feel
but
still
real
strong
needs
to
be
thin
to
balance
out
the
rest
of
the
flavor
this
baby
makes
you
full
this
beer
is
a
meal
unto
itself
very
smoky
and
filling
tremendously
pleasing
i
am
not
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
at
all
and
this
is
no
exception
it
poured
orangered
in
color
thin
head
it
smelled
of
smoke
tasted
of
smoke
with
maybe
some
hops
coming
through
i
didnt
like
this
very
much
i
will
not
be
having
this
anytime
in
the
near
future
d
great
drinkability
per
style
and
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
in
multiples
and
ranks
up
there
with
aecht
schlenkerla
the
standard
of
smoked
beers
d
i
will
probably
drink
this
again
it
really
isnt
in
the
league
with
aecht
schlenkerla
but
its
pretty
damn
good
as
is
m
d
lighter
but
nearly
a
medium
body
a
crisp
carbonation
its
surprisingly
refreshing
although
lighter
in
alcohol
the
flavour
can
get
a
little
intense
as
a
glass
goes
on
so
if
enjoying
a
bomber
alone
its
more
suited
for
sipping
a
really
nice
smoke
beer
initially
all
i
could
get
flavorwise
was
smoke
and
a
slight
underlying
caramel
sweetness
however
as
i
became
acclimated
the
smoke
faded
into
the
background
becoming
an
accent
to
the
fruity
malty
quality
and
strong
floral
hop
matches
well
with
some
sharp
cheddar
an
easy
to
drink
solid
beer
nice
with
some
cheese
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
nice
foam
and
good
retention
lacing
is
rather
light
nice
aroma
of
smoked
malts
some
campfire
a
background
honey
sweetness
and
caramel
goodness
good
smokey
flavor
with
some
hints
of
ripe
fruit
light
hop
bitterness
and
pacman
yeast
dryness
on
the
finish
crisp
surprisingly
refreshing
although
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
smoked
beers
in
one
sitting
we
did
a
roguesouthern
tier
tasting
and
this
was
the
first
in
the
lineup
i
love
both
of
these
brewers
for
trying
new
things
but
i
wouldnt
buy
the
smoke
ale
again
we
had
5
people
splitting
the
22oz
bomber
and
we
all
felt
that
it
was
interesting
but
certainly
couldnt
drink
an
entire
bottle
by
ourselves
another
winner
from
rogue
for
me
this
isnt
an
inherently
drinkable
style
this
is
a
wellmade
effort
no
question
would
prefer
a
12
oz
of
this
to
a
bomber
as
it
warms
the
smoke
takes
over
a
little
too
much
pours
a
nice
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
tan
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
smokeyness
slight
citrus
the
taste
is
malty
smoky
with
some
citrus
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brew
would
recommend
one
of
the
more
drinkable
smoked
beers
it
is
strong
enough
that
if
you
dont
like
the
style
you
may
wish
to
avoid
otherwise
go
out
on
a
limb
and
give
a
go
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
especially
if
you
like
smoked
beers
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
rogue
did
very
well
here
and
id
highly
recommend
it
if
you
like
this
type
of
thing
the
mouth
is
pleasantly
crisp
and
almost
lager
like
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
would
pair
very
well
with
smoked
hams
sausages
a
buffalo
chicken
pizza
or
traditional
german
farmer
fare
overall
not
bad
it
is
certainly
a
smoked
beer
that
is
for
damn
sure
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
seen
i
would
go
back
for
another
round
without
issue
this
was
certainly
very
well
made
and
i
am
more
then
slightly
impressed
rogue
did
a
pretty
nice
job
with
this
im
not
all
that
familiar
or
experienced
with
smoked
beers
but
this
ones
pretty
good
the
nose
could
use
a
little
strengthening
but
its
a
solid
beer
in
all
other
respects
ordered
one
this
past
weekend
at
sunset
grille
came
served
in
a
pretty
large
mug
which
was
a
bonus
not
much
head
and
carbonation
was
minimal
color
was
leather
brown
with
a
hint
of
orange
smell
was
smoky
then
the
taste
more
smoke
very
smoky
indeed
if
this
is
your
first
intro
to
this
style
get
ready
ive
tried
the
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
brewer
producing
a
high
quality
example
of
the
style
its
rather
strong
in
flavor
so
one
was
more
than
enough
for
me
must
be
a
perfect
companion
to
bbq
someday
i
hope
to
pair
them
up
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
im
afraid
the
smokiness
could
get
a
little
old
after
a
few
i
prefer
the
schlenkerla
rauchbier
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
and
highly
suggest
nonetheless
this
is
a
very
good
offering
from
rogue
d
wellcrafted
and
tasty
i
liked
this
more
initially
than
i
did
at
the
end
something
i
cant
say
about
the
german
versions
which
ive
loved
start
to
finish
worth
trying
and
certainly
one
i
could
have
again
drinkability
is
high
i
finished
the
whole
bomber
by
myself
without
much
problem
i
wouldnt
pick
up
another
right
after
it
but
i
might
grab
this
one
again
sometime
d
i
dub
this
smoke
ale
easy
to
drink
for
a
smoked
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
sit
down
and
have
more
then
one
or
two
however
drinkability
is
great
this
brew
screams
to
be
paired
with
any
kind
of
grilled
red
meat
making
it
a
great
bbq
brew
interesting
at
worst
and
savory
at
best
cheers
d
not
really
but
its
a
curious
experiment
and
if
you
have
one
this
old
it
may
have
held
up
mfd
this
is
very
much
a
cup
of
tea
beer
in
that
if
its
your
cup
of
tea
then
this
is
down
your
alley
its
thick
with
nice
carbonation
but
i
just
didnt
personally
care
for
the
taste
which
was
too
overpowering
my
friend
however
loved
it
although
when
i
asked
if
he
could
session
it
immediately
said
that
one
or
two
would
be
the
limit
i
think
itd
be
interesting
if
paired
with
some
bbq
or
would
do
a
tremendous
job
used
in
cooking
hmm
must
buy
some
to
marinate
some
ribs
in
d
good
brew
the
smoke
was
more
subtle
then
i
thought
it
would
be
but
was
very
plesant
i
hve
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
try
this
beer
and
it
did
not
dissipoint
amberorange
colour
with
a
reasonable
nearly
white
head
smokey
woodsy
malt
smell
with
a
faint
iron
smell
to
it
light
smokey
smell
little
hints
of
smoked
meat
and
a
nice
pale
malt
profile
very
low
hop
character
not
nearly
as
smokey
as
mt
begbies
ol
woodenhead
and
as
such
not
as
in
your
face
the
taste
actually
seems
a
little
bit
on
the
thin
side
as
does
the
mouthfeel
this
should
be
much
chewier
than
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
that
rogue
can
do
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
cream
colored
head
from
a
bomber
medium
thick
head
and
semi
lasting
smell
is
lightly
smoky
and
malty
and
a
semi
rich
nice
creamy
body
mild
malty
tartness
and
some
smokiness
in
the
flavor
but
somewhat
restrained
pretty
easy
drinking
and
mild
overall
nice
but
simple
and
perhaps
a
bit
boring
tasted
on
21108
d
quite
drinkable
especially
for
a
smoke
ale
a
well
balanced
brew
recommend
with
uncomplicated
heavy
cheese
like
a
simple
vermont
cheddar
note
ive
had
this
cellared
for
3
yrs
and
it
seems
to
be
completely
unaffected
if
not
better
for
it
22oz
bottle
picked
up
the
brewery
in
newport
pours
into
my
mug
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
smell
is
a
blend
of
smoky
malt
and
light
fruity
hops
taste
is
less
smoky
than
i
was
expecting
but
its
nice
very
earthy
with
just
enough
peaty
smoke
flavor
and
a
pleasing
amount
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
also
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
more
similar
to
a
schenklera
rauchbier
but
im
glad
to
be
surprised
this
is
nice
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
poured
into
a
duvel
snifter
a
nice
dark
copper
almost
brown
with
a
decent
frothy
head
that
lasted
and
left
great
lacing
aroma
was
burnt
wood
chips
and
burnt
caramel
taste
is
dominated
by
a
smoky
mesquite
flavor
with
caramel
and
some
pine
hops
not
far
behind
the
beer
was
on
the
light
side
of
medium
but
the
smoke
flavor
does
provide
for
a
slight
astringency
this
one
is
certainly
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
smoked
beers
ive
had
just
not
something
id
likely
seek
out
again
i
got
this
bottle
at
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
this
was
an
overall
very
good
selection
from
rogue
although
the
smoked
flavor
was
more
subtle
on
this
one
compared
to
aecht
schlenkerla
for
example
the
taste
was
mild
in
comparison
slight
smokey
flavor
is
somewhat
noticeable
more
of
a
strong
ale
type
of
taste
but
either
way
the
flavor
didnt
let
me
down
good
stuff
easily
drinkable
with
a
great
mouthfeel
bread
and
butter
taste
with
a
nutty
flavor
and
aroma
darkcopper
appearance
with
minimal
head
slight
caramel
flavor
with
hoppy
aftertones
excellent
crisp
clear
clean
taste
rogue
did
well
on
this
one
and
i
would
concede
to
say
this
was
a
decent
depiction
of
the
style
i
would
consider
this
a
decent
smoked
beer
and
it
certainly
did
score
for
flavor
and
taste
the
smoked
flavor
managed
to
make
itself
known
good
stuff
recommended
d
a
very
good
brew
a
great
example
of
a
smoked
beer
poured
a
golden
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
gives
a
lace
trace
nose
is
wide
open
with
a
push
of
sweetened
malt
that
is
topped
with
a
chunk
of
smoked
fruit
and
peppers
maybe
even
some
wood
smoke
but
still
rather
mild
taste
begins
smokey
and
melts
out
to
several
stages
of
malt
character
and
rounds
out
with
some
hop
before
coming
back
to
smoke
recommend
this
one
either
to
a
fan
of
the
style
or
to
someone
wanting
to
try
for
the
first
time
have
it
with
some
bbq
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
consider
this
a
session
beer
this
was
my
first
smoke
ale
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
drinkability
i
believe
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
had
of
this
style
i
loved
it
but
more
than
one
bomber
may
have
been
too
much
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
to
some
one
who
wants
to
try
the
style
well
this
is
certainly
interesting
you
can
certainly
tell
that
it
is
rogue
and
you
can
tell
it
is
smoked
pair
with
the
obvious
smoked
food
not
much
here
worth
6
a
bomber
but
i
did
get
2
of
them
so
ill
double
check
with
the
other
bomber
down
the
road
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
on
off
white
head
aromas
of
cedar
and
well
beef
jerky
huge
smokey
aromas
same
in
the
taste
smokey
kind
of
like
dinking
beef
jerky
a
smokey
aftertaste
does
hang
around
but
very
clean
on
the
mouthfeel
love
these
style
of
beer
always
great
for
outdoor
fall
nights
with
pizza
by
the
way
a
good
beer
from
rogue
smoked
beers
are
very
interesting
to
me
and
this
one
seems
to
be
well
done
a
little
more
sweetness
than
in
others
ive
tried
which
is
a
nice
change
i
wish
there
were
more
smoked
beers
around
da
good
smoke
ale
i
seem
to
remember
this
being
smokier
about
10
years
back
which
was
the
last
time
i
tried
it
still
if
you
like
smoke
and
amber
ales
this
is
a
winner
ok
so
you
see
smoke
beer
and
you
wonder
how
are
they
going
to
pull
this
off
i
know
how
the
smoke
aroma
and
flavor
gets
into
scotch
but
didnt
make
sense
for
beer
so
i
was
very
curious
wow
does
this
beer
smoke
not
decided
as
to
whether
i
like
it
or
not
its
much
more
intense
than
you
might
find
in
a
scotch
i
like
the
appearance
because
its
hazy
which
reminds
me
ofsmoke
also
the
aroma
and
taste
both
almost
completely
contain
smoke
with
a
mdeium
creamy
mouthfeel
its
hard
to
look
past
the
main
aspect
of
this
beer
smoke
if
you
liked
smoke
meat
or
foods
and
crave
the
scotch
with
the
most
smoke
this
beer
is
for
you
its
not
overpowering
but
its
there
im
still
undecided
but
i
can
respect
what
the
beer
did
and
it
is
good
just
not
sure
how
good
4
is
solid
and
so
is
this
beer
bottom
line
i
think
its
pretty
good
but
its
not
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
rotation
try
it
and
see
what
you
think
d
this
beer
has
an
interesting
flavor
but
i
would
like
more
malt
flavor
to
compliment
the
smoke
it
is
not
over
smoked
but
more
depth
would
be
nice
the
peat
smoke
flavor
is
soft
and
keeps
the
plastic
bandaid
flavor
down
i
have
to
be
honest
this
surprised
me
im
not
familiar
enough
with
the
style
to
judge
this
on
its
authenticity
but
it
really
is
a
good
beer
rogue
didnt
go
wrong
with
this
one
well
done
another
winner
from
rogue
i
havent
seen
this
one
around
very
often
but
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
pick
it
up
very
enjoyable
hoppiness
balanced
by
the
smoke
ill
pick
this
up
again
nice
golden
orange
tinted
with
a
decent
head
that
gives
a
lace
trace
the
nose
is
wide
open
with
a
push
of
sweetened
malt
that
is
topped
with
a
chunk
of
smoked

and

maybe
even
some

smoke
but
still
rather
mild
the
taste
begins
smokey
and
melts
out
to
several
stages
of
malt
character
and
rounds
out
with
some
hop
before
coming
back
to
smoke
the
body
is
thin
enough
to
make
it
an
easy
drinker
but
substantial
enough
to
make
itself
known
a
good
drinker
to
mix
in
taste
a
heavy
smoked
flavor
not
dissimilar
at
all
from
kansas
city
style
bbq
sauce
a
good
bit
of
fruity
esters
shine
through
the
smoke
along
with
the
malts
to
give
the
beer
a
nice
sweetness
medium
bodied
nothing
particular
interesting
about
the
mouthfeel
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
very
enjoyable
aroma
that
features
some
malt
with
a
nice
smelling
smoke
flavor
as
well
the
taste
features
some
malt
and
a
good
amount
of
hops
but
the
smoke
flavor
seems
to
dominate
the
taste
a
little
much
i
would
have
prefered
for
there
to
have
been
a
little
bit
more
backing
the
smoke
flavor
but
it
still
is
a
good
brew
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
brew
and
definately
something
different
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
is
a
decent
smoke
beer
i
think
its
a
little
heavy
to
drink
more
than
the
large
bottle
i
purchased
in
one
session
dthis
stuff
was
a
godsend
i
have
to
pick
up
a
couple
bombers
next
time
it
was
really
tasty
and
hits
the
spot
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
enjoys
good
beer
hail
to
the
berlin
wall
for
falling
my
first
finished
smoked
beer
where
rauchbiers
have
put
me
off
and
they
went
down
the
drain
this
beer
was
my
first
finished
smoked
beer
the
color
is
a
ruby
brown
that
makes
me
immediately
think
of
slightly
smoked
oak
stove
lengths
light
bubbling
in
this
thick
cloudy
hue
the
aroma
is
of
a
campfire
you
are
100
feet
downwind
of
lots
of
smokey
wood
qualities
plus
tpasty
looking
malts
but
just
smell
smokey
the
taste
is
a
bit
cloying
this
22oz
bomber
would
go
very
well
with
a
smoked
pork
entree
of
pulled
pork
and
baby
back
ribs
bbq
sauce
the
smoked
wood
dominates
the
palate
no
hops
seem
to
contribute
to
the
flavor
in
any
significant
way
hints
of
toasty
malts
and
a
little
clove
sweetmness
lingers
around
the
whole
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
more
over
the
top
with
smoke
i
could
not
have
more
than
one
of
these
beers
in
one
day
poured
out
a
darkish
orange
brown
cloudy
with
a
thin
off
white
head
minimal
lacing
smells
like
my
kitchen
on
sunday
morning
bacon
anyone
on
a
side
note
six
degrees
of
kevin
bacon
killer
stuff
but
i
regress
some
malt
some
mollasses
lots
of
hickory
like
smoke
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
balanced
than
the
nose
ues
lots
of
smoke
but
not
as
sweet
theres
malt
but
a
full
body
helps
to
balance
the
big
smoke
out
whats
great
about
this
is
that
the
smoke
is
there
when
you
drink
it
but
it
goes
away
with
the
nice
clean
finish
rogue
smoke
ale
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
and
smoke
is
noticeable
starts
out
malty
then
the
smoke
kicks
in
followed
by
hops
and
more
smoke
im
not
really
a
huge
fan
of
smoke
ales
but
this
one
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
not
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
for
me
i
think
finishing
the
bomber
may
be
a
chore
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
the
style
d
this
is
a
bit
more
subtle
and
isnt
as
intense
as
the
schenkerla
rauchbiers
which
could
be
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
depending
on
your
tastes
being
as
this
comes
in
a
bomber
rather
than
a
500ml
i
think
that
his
is
probably
a
good
thing
and
contributes
to
this
beers
drinkability
not
my
cup
of
tea
its
like
cracking
open
a
beer
after
sitting
for
hours
around
some
sort
of
mesquite
campfire
overall
a
great
bold
and
complex
tasting
rauchbier
this
tasted
like
the
chipotle
ale
without
the
annoying
spiciness
that
masked
the
finish
now
excuse
while
i
go
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
with
a
bag
of
pork
rinds
3

7
oz
roguexs
bottling
this
beer
pours
a
burnt
orange
amber
with
a
giant
tan
foamy
head
this
beer
is
a
work
of
art
to
look
at
the
smell
is
a
strong
smoked
wood
odoralmost
a
sweet
malt
very
nice
the
taste
is
creamy
and
smooththe
smoke
flavor
is
dominate
but
doesnt
smother
the
other
more
subtle
flavors
which
include
malt
hops
and
some
fruitcherry
the
mf
is
light
and
very
well
balanced
an
excellant
beer
for
a
bbq
but
i
cant
say
id
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
i
really
like
this
beer
its
just
that
the
flavor
is
different
and
may
be
tough
to
have
more
than
2
cheers
so
yeah
salmon
beer
never
thought
id
see
the
day
somehow
though
it
works
i
just
wish
it
didnt
also
sit
in
the
glass
like
a
dead
salmon
after
a
minute
or
two
22
oz
bomber
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
over
top
that
falls
to
a
solid
coat
over
top
maintained
by
a
fairly
constant
bubble
up
the
side
clarity
on
this
drink
is
excellent
the
aroma
on
this
one
conveys
a
very
solid
sweet
smoke
with
a
moderate
caramel
maltyness
hanging
below
it
the
smoke
is
strong
but
not
offensive
and
the
sweetness
is
just
right
for
me
i
like
it
flavor
is
also
dominated
by
smokey
flavors
again
the
smoke
is
very
nicely
sweet
with
a
definate
caramel
base
behind
it
before
swallowing
hte
beer
it
has
an
edge
to
the
smoke
but
then
after
swallowing
it
the
sweetness
really
takes
hold
the
aftertaste
has
the
smoke
fading
a
bit
with
the
caramel
sweetness
coming
in
more
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
nice
smoked
beer
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
nice
moderate
carbonation
it
is
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
seeming
to
pull
the
moisture
from
my
tongue
id
rather
the
dryness
not
be
there
overall
i
think
this
one
is
definately
drinkable
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
to
the
solid
smokeyness
it
is
very
lively
and
really
tastes
good
to
me
drinks
fairly
easy
this
more
restrained
than
i
remember
tastes
ive
had
in
years
past
this
is
an
excellent
breakfast
with
eggs
grits
or
bbq
beer
this
could
almost
pass
as
a
bamberg
rauch
imo
almost
this
beer
is
a
little
more
carbonated
than
id
like
nonetheless
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
is
another
quality
beer
from
rogue
drinkability
quite
consumable
complex
inviting
flavor
its
satisfying
while
not
filling
a
unique
beer
that
is
an
altogether
good
experience
pours
a
deep
reddishcopper
which
is
moderately
cloudy
and
forms
a
three
finger
light
beige
head
that
lasts
forever
but
leaves
relatively
little
lacing
smell
is
smoked
salmon
peppery
and
clove
notes
and
a
deep
woody
smokiness
with
a
definite
note
of
fish
in
the
background
taste
is
heavily
smoky
at
first
with
a
nice
spiciness
and
some
interesting
woody
notes
but
then
the
finish
is
all
fish
again
mouthfeel
is
thick
rich
and
nicely
carbonated
but
the
drinkability
isnt
great
i
just
couldnt
get
the
thought
that
i
was
drinking
a
salmon
smoothie
out
of
my
mind
and
that
kind
of
killed
this
one
for
me
it
poured
a
dark
copper
to
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
when
held
up
to
a
light
the
head
was
small
and
faded
quickly
the
smell
was
malty
a
bit
sweet
and
full
of
smoke
which
was
a
good
sweet
bbq
type
of
smoke
the
taste
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
trace
of
hops
then
the
smoke
hits
you
the
smoke
flavor
is
not
as
overwhelming
as
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
it
was
perfect
the
mouthfeel
was
about
in
the
medium
range
somewhat
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
with
adequate
carbonation
at
first
taste
i
was
not
sure
if
this
was
going
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
the
smoke
taste
i
found
that
as
i
became
accustomed
to
the
smoke
it
became
much
more
drinkable
however
this
would
not
be
my
choice
for
a
session
beer
its
more
of
a
drink
with
a
meal
beer
i
would
really
like
to
have
this
with
some
slow
smoked
ribs
or
maybe
even
some
smoked
salmon
it
seems
to
get
more
and
more
drinkable
as
you
go
but
the
22oz
serving
is
probably
a
bit
much
i
bet
this
would
go
fantastically
with
some
barbecue
copper
color
body
with
a
very
thick
head
that
held
up
for
a
little
while
the
smokey
aroma
was
mellow
and
not
overpowering
like
some
beers
of
this
style
kind
of
sweet
maltiness
that
finished
with
the
flavor
of
smoke
and
a
slight
hop
character
nothing
bitter
about
this
one
medium
body
with
a
smooth
almost
creamylike
mouthfeel
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
can
probably
only
handle
it
in
small
doses
22
oz
is
a
bit
much
for
me
due
to
the
smoke
flavor
it
gets
to
me
after
awhile
otherwise
this
beer
is
a
highly
drinkable
one
reddish
brown
clearish
appearance
translucent
on
the
second
glass
decent
smallbubbled
head
of
about
one
finger
after
settling
a
while
rings
of
fairly
thick
lace
nice
aroma
plums
and
an
appetizing
applewood
kind
of
smoke
though
there
are
elements
of
musty
thickerbarked
wood
light
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
fairly
high
overall
a
nice
body
though
i
personally
would
like
it
to
be
a
bit
fuller
easy
drinker
here
mainly
a
neutral
malt
with
an
apparent
smokiness
but
nothing
that
is
at
overwhelming
aftertaste
is
pleasant
a
continuing
campfire
sense
that
becomes
more
pronounced
on
warming
hops
also
become
more
evident
at
the
close
though
to
me
it
might
have
been
interesting
to
see
how
an
even
higher
hop
level
added
to
the
complexity
though
mainly
for
my
own
entertainment
still
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
someone
looking
for
a
nice
and
relatively
accessible
smoked
beer
this
one
is
an
odd
duck
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
ill
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
probably
once
it
warms
up
and
i
get
the
grill
going
im
willing
to
bet
the
smoky
features
on
this
one
will
go
well
with
barbeque
and
the
like
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
one
of
my
favorites
by
rogue
this
beer
put
them
on
the
map
for
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
a
night
backyard
bbq
or
watching
the
game
with
some
wings
cheers
i
undoubtedly
purchased
an
old
version
of
this
brew
though
old
my
impressions
are
strong
purchased
at
the
party
source
in
n
kentucky
the
7oz
bottle
displays
a
pink
painted
rouge
character
and
stated
bottled
in
1995
upon
a
brown
bottle
with
a
cap
that
says
florida
anyway
a
solid
and
well
rounded
smoke
and
hop
aroma
was
instantly
displayed
dark
amber
to
brown
with
a
light
haze
virtually
no
carboation
detected
rich
malt
and
smoke
flavors
on
a
moderate
body
makes
the
smoke
more
apparant
texture
is
smooth
and
lightly
rich
thin
and
light
body
partly
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
noticable
notes
of
soy
sauce
and
sherry
flavors
in
the
finish
would
have
been
great
to
have
this
one
in
its
prime
a
decent
brew
but
i
think
ill
stick
with
rauchbiers
and
smoked
porters
d
i
was
most
impressed
with
the
dazzling
array
of
aromas
in
this
beer
it
is
a
combination
of
so
many
unique
smells
the
taste
was
good
but
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
the
head
is
onefinger
in
height
creamy
and
white
the
aroma
is
of
smoked
malt
and
more
smoked
malt
the
taste
is
of
smoked
malt
with
some
caramel
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
than
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
this
beer
poured
quickly
but
looked
somewhat
flat
with
no
head
retention
the
color
is
an
opaque
amber
there
is
a
strong
aroma
of
smoky
bacon
that
is
unmistakable
the
smokiness
caries
through
the
first
taste
and
there
is
a
definite
bitterness
and
sourness
to
the
beer
but
no
real
sweetness
it
feels
thin
and
flat
in
the
mouth
the
smoke
flavor
is
very
distinct
on
this
one
but
it
doesnt
yield
to
many
other
flavors
i
would
say
the
beer
is
onedimensional
and
could
use
more
maltiness
to
give
it
balance
this
is
very
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
the
flavor
is
great
and
i
had
no
trouble
getting
through
this
one
i
kept
wanting
more
and
still
do
i
will
go
back
for
this
one
again
and
again
tasty
session
beer
eh
maybe
under
the
right
pretense
i
still
think
it
may
be
a
bit
much
after
awhile
put
this
in
the
definitely
worth
checking
it
out
if
you
see
it
but
dont
go
ape
looking
for
it
category
drinkability
and
notes

definitely
sessionable
the
smoke
never
gets
to
aggressive
or
annoying
this
is
a
tasty
american
version
of
a
rauchbier
in
my
opinion
only
one
notch
below
some
of
the
finest
german
examples
the
fact
that
this
was
made
with
ale
yeast
really
doesnt
affect
the
flavor
the
smoke
covers
any
difference
the
yeast
makes
body
is
a
reddish
amber
color
with
good
sized
off
white
head
nice
big
smokiness
up
front
with
plenty
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
in
the
back
light
hops
flavor
is
similar
with
plenty
of
smoke
up
front
but
not
enough
to
be
over
bearing
solid
sweet
malt
backbones
adds
a
bit
of
balance
to
this
ends
on
a
light
smoky
note
solid
mouthfeel
and
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
a
smoked
beer
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
smoked
beers
but
tasty
and
enjoyable
anyway
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
brew
much
smokier
than
the
other
examples
that
i
have
tried
a
nice
smoked
beer
from
rogue
poured
out
to
a
brown
orange
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
medium
carbonation
some
notes
of
lace
around
the
glass
aroma
of
smoked
malts
and
grain
are
present
as
is
a
sweet
hickory
element
taste
was
a
bit
softer
than
the
aroma
but
still
very
nice
flavors
of
smoke
wood
earth
and
minor
hints
of
hops
rather
nice
i
must
say
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
still
respectable
enough
to
rise
above
many
others
good
drinkability
this
brew
would
make
a
great
combo
with
cheeses
and
breads
or
go
well
on
its
own
not
as
good
as
a
traditional
rauchbier
but
still
very
well
made
and
enjoyable
recommended
surprisingly
fizzy
head
which
dissolves
to
nothing
after
a
few
seconds
absolutely
zero
when
it
comes
to
lacing
coppertinted
color
the
taste
is
initially
beef
jerky
in
a
bottle
the
finish
is
so
dry
and
woody
i
dont
really
understand
the
appeal
but
then
again
so
far
i
havent
been
much
of
a
fan
of
smoke
beers
ofallons
smoked
porter
was
soso
in
my
opinion
and
this
one
is
probably
a
step
down
from
that
i
wouldnt
be
so
dissapointed
if
i
wasnt
expecting
the
high
quality
i
usually
get
from
rogue
not
one
im
likely
to
buy
again
especially
for
the
price
bomber
bottle
typical
rogue
lack
of
freshness
indication
this
one
pours
medium
amber
slightly
orange
tinged
and
abit
cloudy
off
white
head
initially
puffy
settling
down
to
a
minor
film
this
one
leaves
gobs
of
thick
lacing
nose
is
mildly
of
rubbery
old
gym
shoes
and
some
malt
this
creation
is
moderatly
smoked
to
my
taste
buds
tastes
like
the
malts
have
been
smoking
for
a
reasonablejudicious
amount
of
time
clearly
this
would
be
a
fine
choice
to
go
along
with
some
bbq
or
other
smoked
foods
another
fine
brew
from
the
crafty
folks
rogue
i
think
i
am
in
love
with
smoke
beers
and
this
rogue
offering
doesnt
do
anything
except
make
me
want
them
even
more
than
before
what
a
wonderful
beer
it
pours
a
nice
orangeamber
color
and
has
a
decent
white
head
its
aroma
is
filled
with
a
robust
smokiness
that
i
can
get
lost
in
and
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
in
that
regard
it
is
damn
fine
all
by
itself
but
would
be
killer
paired
with
some
smoked
foods
pours
a
dark
cherry
red
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
aroma
is
smoked
saugage
burnt
wood
some
floral
hops
taste
is
goodsweet
smoky
cheese
and
saugage
flavors
wrapped
in
a
nice
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
hoppy
campfire
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
this
is
a
smooth
drinker
this
is
my
first
smoke
ale
and
while
it
definitely
tastes
better
than
i
expected
the
smoke
doesnt
really
refresh
and
i
needed
a
glass
of
water
to
finish
the
last
6
oz
of
the
bomber
also
i
had
this
with
barbequei
think
the
smoke
would
be
too
much
for
me
on
its
own
overall
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
very
refreshing
beer
and
very
drinkable
im
a
greater
fan
of
the
style
than
most
and
although
smoke
beers
are
definitely
made
for
sipping
a
had
no
problem
downing
a
22
ounce
bomber
of
rogue
smoke
it
truly
is
a
grand
example
of
its
style
and
a
great
way
to
cap
off
an
evening
dull
orange
in
colour
with
a
small
off
white
head
faint
smoke
aroma
along
with
notes
of
sweet
malt
the
dominant
flavor
is
obviously
the
smoke
but
its
a
bit
more
mellow
than
other
smoked
beers
that
ive
tried
the
malty
munich
flavor
that
i
tend
to
associate
with
rogue
beers
isnt
quite
as
dominant
either
this
beer
gains
points
for
being
balanced
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
umph
the
tase
welll
i
must
say
i
am
pleased
i
am
used
to
the
idea
of
a
smoked
stout
or
porter
but
not
a
standard
ale
and
this
has
just
become
a
new
and
great
drinking
expeirence
smoke
comes
through
right
away
but
not
in
an
overbearing
sense
just
there
a
deep
balanced
with
hop
smokey
flavor
not
like
smoked
meats
but
like
a
fall
campfire
very
nice
in
the
management
of
hops
and
smoke
flavor
solid
malt
aftertaste
just
washes
everything
down
in
a
great
finish
the
over
all
balance
of
this
brew
strikes
me
from
the
smokey
flavor
to
the
malty
finish
good
job
from
rouge
and
props
for
saluting
the
fall
of
the
wall
md
mediumbodied
and
very
flavoursome
this
rather
wellbalanced
beer
manages
to
present
its
smoky
characteristics
in
an
understated
manner
but
the
aftertaste
gradually
turns
thiner
and
leaves
a
bit
sugary
residual
taste
on
the
swallow
similar
to
what
the
famous
schlenkerla
marzen
showed
me
in
the
end
which
i
suppose
is
the
weakest
link
in
this
beers
overall
structure
all
in
all
i
like
this
beer
very
much
but
id
like
to
see
it
coming
in
a
smaller
bottle
500ml
at
most
or
even
better
330ml
for
although
this
beers
aroma
is
consistently
pleasant
the
complexity
of
its
taste
cannot
sustain
long
enough
for
more
than
two
halfpints
and
still
remain
interesting
to
me
overall
coming
from
a
usual
nonfan
of
smoked
beers
this
one
is
actually
pretty
enjoyable
decent
taste
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
smoothness
of
it
id
actually
have
another
this
is
one
of
the
rogues
thats
worth
the
money
smoke
ale
is
good
beer
it
wont
satisfy
anyone
looking
for
an
overwhelmingly
oily
hugely
smoky
fix
schlenkerla
but
it
is
a
wellcrafted
ale
that
uses
its
smoked
malt
judiciously
rather
than
promiscuously
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
im
glad
that
my
local
grocery
keeps
it
in
stock
dedicated
to
the
fall
of
the
berlin
wall
ill
drink
to
that
this
beer
goes
perfectly
with
dryroasted
peanuts
yum
this
brew
appears
as
a
deep
orangebrown
color
poured
a
decent
head
which
dissapated
qucikly
and
is
leaving
no
residual
lacing
nose
is
an
interesting
blend
of
the
smoke
used
for
meats
on
the
grill
and
floral
hops
taste
initially
is
overwhelmingly
heavy
with
the
smoke
but
as
i
continue
to
sample
this
brew
the
hops
presence
is
becoming
stronger
mouthfeel
is
good
full
and
lively
on
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
ok
this
beer
grows
on
you
complemented
it
very
well
the
smoke
and
the
salmon
plus
the
pepper
and
the
hops
pours
a
clear
deep
reddish
orange
with
about
5
of
creamcoloured
bubbly
head
fed
by
some
vigorous
carbonation
with
some
excellent
retention
some
sweet
malt
and
some
hops
detectable
in
the
nose
but
its
largely
smoke
smells
like
smoked
haddock
or
other
whitefish
quite
pleasant
some
sweet
malts
at
first
and
then
the
smoke
flavour
kicks
in
on
the
first
sip
the
smokiness
continues
for
a
little
while
and
eventually
gives
way
to
the
hoppy
finish
which
lingers
pleasantly
the
smokiness
is
just
right
for
me
very
lovely
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
carbonated
for
me
i
prefer
this
to
some
of
the
german
rauchbiers
which
are
a
less
subtle
i
find
im
pretty
sure
the
smoked
malt
is
different
this
is
much
more
of
a
smoked
fish
flavour
than
smoked
ham
very
very
tasty
and
a
nice
sipping
brew
my
gawd
i
think
im
drinking
a
salami
sandwich
its
actually
kinda
tasty
and
a
lot
better
than
eating
subway
appearance
is
a
deep
amber
color
and
cloudy
as
usual
for
a
rogue
i
didnt
know
anyone
made
beers
that
taste
like
a
smoked
deli
sandwich
i
suppose
if
beer
is
liquid
bread
then
its
not
so
farfetched
i
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
beer
well
enough
but
i
cant
see
myself
buying
it
again
if
offered
one
however
i
would
not
refuse
big
head
cloudy
brown
aroma
of
smoke
but
also
floral
hops
smoke
fruity
peachgrassy
hops
carmel
malt
sweetness
more
smoke
a
rogue
is
there
behind
the
smoke
i
may
like
it
without
all
the
smoke
thanks

just
a

this

be
the

dark

nearly
opaque
brew
small

that
did
not
last
the
smell
was
smokehouse
all
the
way
i
grew
up
with
dad
smoking
chicken
turkeys
and
hams
at
least
once
a
month
sticking
my
nose
in
a
glass
of
this
brought
back
memories
of
those
days
this
starts
out
for
about
a
millisecond
like
an
amber
ale
thenpowsmoky
flavor
like
a
hickory
ham
hits
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
the
smoke
flavor
coats
the
mouth
there
is
a
discernible
hoppiness
at
the
end
that
balances
everything
this
was
served
with
cincinnatistyle
chili
a
threeway
for
those
that
know
and
matched
up
very
well
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber

with
a
1
finger
beige
head
didnt
last
to
long
nice
lace
smell
of
a
sweet
high
quality
true
smoked
ham
some
caramel
malt
smells
but
mainly
the
smokiness
is
what
comes
through
the
best
way
to
describe
this
is
an
apa
with
some
smokiness
added
the
first
taste
recognized
is
the
smoke
then
a
nice
caramel
malt
followed
by
just
enough
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
i
discovered
that
the
more
i
drank
this
the
less
i
tasted
the
smoke
it
is
still
noticeable
but
just
not
as
profound
as
the
first
few
sips
a
decent
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
taste
is
mostly
malty
with
a
fairly
sharp
hoppy
aftertaste
clingly
mouthfeel
feels
like
youre
inhaling
incense
or
standing
over
the
charcoal
grille
while
drinking
it
pretty
light
body
and
mild
smokiness
make
this
a
nice
beer
i
imagine
this
would
go
great
with
pork
ribs
maybe
not
the
best
smoked
beer
but
a
good
effort
by
an
american
brewery
to
mimic
this
german
style
more
bacon
fat
please
less
malt
sweetness
and
spicy
hops
a
reddish
brown
brew
with
an
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
that
does
give
way
to
minimal
near
the
end
aroma
you
guessed
it
smoke
reminders
of
putting
the
hickory
smoke
chips
on
the
bbq
reminded
me
of
being
back
in
germany
when
the
butchers
had
their
smokers
going
underneath
the
bbq
aroma
is
a
nice
aroma
of
hops
not
strong
but
they
are
present
taste
is
a
malt
front
then
the
smoke
takes
over
to
a
mildly
hop
finish
i
dint
know
what
to
expect
but
i
enjoyed
this
brew
i
do
think
after
a
few
of
these
brews
the
smoke
would
get
to
me
but
one
or
two
with
a
good
meal
or
just
to
enjoyhell
yea

head

some
resiliency
with
good
foamy
lacing
aroma
is
of
smoke
mainly
with
apparent
malt
and
hops
present
taste
is
a
pleasingly
balanced
with
smoke
present
but
not
overpowering
throughout
the
experience
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
good
for
a
smoked
beer
nice
representative
of
the
style
this
is
a
slightly
hazey
some
may
say
smokey
amber
ale
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
you
guessed
it
smoke
and
a
hint
of
spicey
hops
in
the
background
again
in
the
flavor
the
smokeyness
takes
front
stage
but
the
lightly
sweet
and
the
bitter
hop
finish
balances
out
the
flavor
of
the
beer
so
that
you
are
not
overpowered
by
the
smoke
goes
down
as
easy
as
any
basic
german
lager
very
easy
to
handle
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
smoke
flavor
at
all
very
mild
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
if
you
liked
smoked
beers
you
must
try
rogue
smoke
ale
this
beer
pours
a
dark
color
with
very
little
head

actually
no
head
came
in
a
7oz
bottle
from
1996
no
carbonation
the
aroma
is
definitely
smoked
nothing
much
other
than
that
the
flavor
is
the
same
maltysmokiness
its
good
but
i
dont
know
how
much
of
it
i
could
take
poured
a
dark
orangereddish
color
with
minimal
head
though
it
retains
a
film
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
almost
all
smoke
the
more
subtle
smells
arent
quite
coming
through
flavor
of
course
is
also
dominated
by
smoked
malts
although
it
does
have
a
degree
of
hoppy
bitternessdryness
on
both
the
front
and
the
finish
i
am
a
fan
of
smoke
beers
and
an
even
bigger
fan
of
rogue
if
this
sounds
familiar
you
will
like
this
otherwise
this
is
an
aquired
taste
try
it
if
you
have
an
openmind
pours
a
dark
orange
color
huge
offwhite
head
that
has
very
good
retention
smells
of
woodsmoke
and
not
much
more
very
weird
for
a
beer
taste
is
very
smokey
very
dry
and
extremely
cloying
i
do
not
like
this
beer
the
flavor
is
not
enjoyable
at
all
and
may
be
the
first
beer
i
have
poured
out
in
a
long
time
get
something
else
from
rogue
who
makes
many
different
palatable
beers
drinkability

great
mix
of
flavor
and
character
here
its
not
as
harsh
as
a
true
german
rauchbier
which
some
find
a
bit
too
much
pours

beers

a
medium

with
average

aroma
is
comprised
of
subtle
smoke
and
some
malt
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
smoke
but
im
not
complaining
since
smoke
beer
is
not
my
favourite
style
taste
can
also
be
described
as
lightly
smoke
with
some
nice
malt
to
support
the
smoke
overall
this
is
probably
a
more
balanced
smoke
ale
then
what
is
generally
known
as
smoke
ale
which
i
appreciated
since
this
is
not
my
favourite
style
largely
clear
copperyamber
in
hue
with
a
slight
peachy
highlight
it
is
a
lovely
color
the
head
never
developed
much
beyond
a
fizzy
cap
this
cap
quickly
turned
into
a
collar
naked
in
the
middle
there
is
no
subsequent
lacing
the
appearance
is
pleasant
but
far
from
stellar
the
nose
is
raunchier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
which
is
a
great
thing
my
experiences
with
smoke
ale
lead
me
to
believe
otherwise
it
is
not
schlenkerla
urbock
but
what
is
the
bouquet
has
all
the
desired
aromas
like
fatty
bacon
charred
wood
resting
at
a
campfire
hammy
too
a
pleasant
surprise
the
potency
is
solid
while
it
is
not
vibrant
it
is
plenty
healthy
i
find
it
inviting
the
bouquet
had
me
thinking
raunch
and
not
rogue
i
damn
near
forgot
who
brewed
this
and
then
i
tasted
it
hops
big
bright
american
hops
the
fingerprints
of
rogue
please
dont
misinterpret
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
lovely
stuff
it
is
just
not
a
raunchbier
nor
is
like
any
smoke
ale
ive
tasted
before
it
is
uniquely
rogue
with
that
said
the
palate
starts
off
with
some
fatty
hammy
charred
woody
flavors
none
of
these
tastes
are
that
loud
and
i
am
not
wowed
by
the
intensity
again
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
still
i
can
taste
these
qualities
clearly
that
is
nice
true
maltiness
is
never
detected
i
bet
this
beer
would
be
considerably
better
with
a
maltier
backbone
depth
is
needed
in
the
middle
the
hops
kick
in
citrusy
bitter
kind
of
brash
as
they
now
stand
above
the
initial
flavors
by
the
finish
the
hoppiness
dominates
until
the
aftertaste
which
is
a
nice
mix
of
smoke
fat
and
citrus
that
might
sound
odd
but
it
works
yummy
medium
in
body
but
it
seems
a
tickle
too
thin
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
tasty
the
hoppiness
works
well
with
the
traditional
smoked
qualities
this
beer
would
really
kick
ass
with
some
tangy
bbq
i
also
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
as
i
am
sailing
through
the
bomber
i
purchased
in
burnsville

smell
all
smoke
to
my

taste
watery
beer
that
starts
out
tasting
like
smoke
than
becomes
bitter
sweet
the
smoke
stays
with
you
long
after
the
first
drink
my
first
smoked
beer
cant
wait
to
try
more
the
appearance
of
this
beer
scores
high
for
clarity
and
brilliance
but
is
undercut
by
a
lack
of
head
and
lace
ultimately
i
like
the
architecture
but
not
the
construction
liquid
gold
and
hazy
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
this
beer
smells
like
a
rasher
of
bacon
lives
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
taste
was
smoky
with
a
bacon
note
but
the
backbone
was
in
place
this
is
not
the
most
intense
rauchbier
but
it
is
easier
drinking
than
alaskas
offering
i
like
this
beer
but
i
find
that
i
actually
crave
more
smokiness
and
intensity
of
flavour
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
color
and
is
topped
by
a
thick
tan
head
i
get
an
immediate
aroma
of
smoked
malt
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
maltiness
lying
underneath
the
taste
is
smooth
lightly
sweet
with
a
nice
meaty
middle
the
smoke
is
first
detected
in
the
finish
which
is
long
drying
and
smoky
interestingly
enough
the
combination
of
smoke
and
malt
in
some
way
reminds
me
of
oranges
though
i
cant
quite
say
why
though
the
beer
is
light
as
it
goes
down
the
smoke
adds
a
nice
full
richness
to
this
beer
that
is
quite
good
this
is
somewhat
subtle
for
a
smoked
beer
but
it
is
a
great
level
of
smokiness
for
this
particular
beer
it
is
very
well
balanced
sampled

i
like
rauchbiers
but
this
one
left
me
wanting
to
try
something
else
as
it
was
unsatisfying
truly
interesting
beer
but
after
the
novelty
of
the
smokey
smell
wears
thin
theres
really
not
much
to
keep
my
attention
thanks
to
budsboy
for
providing
the
porch
update
i
got
ripped
off
i
bought
a
7oz
bottle
of
roguexs
smoke
ale
thinking
it
was
a
different
beast
turns
out
its
the
exact
same
thing
you
get
in
the
22oz
bottle
flat
too
1

still
tastes
good
though
chalkier
in
the
finish
perhaps
more
suggestions
of
prunes
and
raisins
just
because
its
probably
older
overall
a
very
nice
smoked
beer
the
more
of
these
i
have
the
more
i
like
them
this
brew
has
an
amber
colored
body
bubbly
tan
head
on
top
the
scent
is
a
charcoal
like
aroma
the
best
way
i
can
describe
the
taste
is
that
it
tastes
like
a
campfire
the
smoke
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
some
subtle
bitter
hops
medfull
mouth
this
is
a
new
style
for
me
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
with
but
i
did
like
it
overall
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
malt
scent
surrounded
by
a
mild
smokey
aroma
that
gives
it
character
the
taste
is
good
it
has
dry
yet
malty
flavor
which
is
enhanced
by
an
excellent
smoke
taste
it
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
smoke
ale
it
has
good
smokey
aroma
and
flavor
note
my
first
smoked
beer
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
pizza
this
beer
had
notes
that
are
very
similar
to
the
rogue
imperial
stout
i
approached
this
with
some
reluctance
ive
had
some
bad
experiences
with
smoked
beers
in
the
past
this
one
could
make
me
a
believer
however
a
masterful
balance
of
smoke
flavors
that
enhances
rather
than
overpowers
the
malt
the
aroma
is
a
faint
notquite
hickory
smoke
the
smoke
flavors
are
well
integrated
and
there
was
a
subtle
sort
of
barnyard
funkyness
lurking
in
the
depths
that
gave
the
beer
an
almost
drycured
country
ham
flavor
an
interesting
beer
and
while
not
something
i
would
want
a
lot
of
at
a
sitting
it
was
surpisingly
drinkable
this
is
a
delicious
and
complex
brew
there
isnt
too
much
smoke
so
that
it
drowns
out
the
other
ingredients
id
label
it
as
complex
and
satisfying
and
it
would
be
a
perfect
compliment
to
some
smoked
meat
and
cheeses
cloudy
amber
appearance
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
very
smokey
as
expected
but
the
taste
had
a
much
more
toned
down
smokiness
to
it
which
i
liked
the
smoke
taste
is
there
and
lingers
in
my
mouth
but
it
does
not
overwhelm
hops
are
quite
spicy
and
mix
excellently
with
the
smoked
malt
other
german
aspects
are
there
creating
a
smooth
and
creamy
body
alcohol
becomes
more
of
a
precense
the
warmer
the
beer
gets
body
was
on
the
light
side
which
made
drinking
this
way
too
easy
i
think
i
need
more
3

a
bomber
appearance
slightly
cloudy
amber
hue
nice
sized
cream
head
leaves
nice
evenly
strung
lacing
aroma
wonderful
balanced
smokey
aromatics
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
kicking
around
and
a
caramel
malt
profile
is
evident
taste
nice
strong
smokiness
not
in
your
face
as
some
bamber
born
rauchbier
but
smokey
all
the
same
smoked
malts
blend
well
with
the
heavily
hopped
profile
malts
are
reserved
to
some
they
are
enought
to
not
offend
while
others
may
yearn
for
more
smoke
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
ale
smooth
carbonation
as
the
end
of
the
bottle
nears
body
becomes
a
bit
thicker
drinkability
one
of
the
best
all
around
rauchbiers
ive
tasted
so
balanced
yet
heavily
smoked
the
malt
sweetness
and
hop
flavor
develop
a
bit
more
after
the
beer
warms
a
bit
but
this
is
still
probably
the
smokiest
beer
ive
ever
had
a
bit
much
for
me
on
its
own
but
i
reckon
it
would
go
great
with
some
bbq
22
0z
bomber
and
the
first
bottle
ive
ever
seen
where
i
learned
that
this
one
is
dedicated
to
to
the
fall
of
the
berlin
wall
and
to
all
the
great
beer
that
issued
forth
from
the
great
land
of
deutsch
got
the
last
of
the
bomber
so
it
poured
opaque
with
sediment
and
yeast
color
was
dull
muted
cherrywood
amber
color
with
a
smokey
look
to
it
head
was
decent
but
nothing
special
with
a
bit
of
lace
the
smell
is
as
the
name
would
suggest
immediately
smokey
reminds
me
of
a
smoked
cheddar
cheese
i
had
once
but
there
is
a
background
of
hops
and
malts
definately
with
a
small
lemon
hint
taste
is
smokey
also
although
in
a
more
subdued
manner
than
the
smell
the
malt
is
evident
and
a
finish
of
hops
pushes
through
at
the
end
there
is
also
a
starchy
grass
taste
to
it
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
yet
it
leaves
a
starched
dry
feel
on
the
tongue
and
roof
of
mouth
out
of
the
characteristic
bomber
pours
this
clear
reddish
mahogany
ale
with
a
sparkling
thing
head
that
settles
to
a
spotty
lace
the
peaty
smoke
flavor
is
immediately
evident
in
the
aroma
but
theres
some
good
sweet
malt
lurking
in
the
background
theres
a
figlike
undercurrent
too
the
hearty
charcoal
smokiness
dominates
the
taste
overpowering
the
light
citrus
and
floral
touches
which
each
emerge
steadily
as
the
taste
moves
to
a
lighter
and
more
balanced
finish
more
potently
burnt
than
the
racer
red
rocket
and
the
stone
smoked
porter
highly
recommended
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
probably
good
with
a
rack
of
ribs
but
at
only
7
ounces
a
bottle
i
may
need
a
rack
of
these
too
outside
of
food
pairings
this
is
drinkable
as
a
novelty
but
for
me
not
much
more
just
for
experimental
purposes
i
had
this
with
some
mesquite
bbq
pringles
and
the
smokiness
is
well
subdued
as
the
spices
on
the
snack
make
the
beer
relatively
less
smoked
so
it
stands
to
reason
if
eaten
with
smoked
or
spicy
food
it
will
come
across
much
less
distinctive
when
i
first
started
the
beer
and
the
carbonation
was
present
it
was
working
well
but
midway
through
it
decided
to
go
flat
on
me
and
my
feelings
on
it
took
a
severe
hit
as
did
the
drinkability
i
think
the
moral
of
the
story
is
to
drink
it
with
food
and
make
sure
you
get
it
down
before
the
carbonation
leaves
town
acidic
snappy
bite
medium
feel
different
would
go
great
with
barbeque
especially
smoked
food
the
smell
and
appearance
were
the
highlights
of
this
brew
other
than
that
it
was
kind
of
hard
to
finish
due
to
the
overwhelming
hoppiness
compared
to
other
smoke
beers
that
i
have
had
this
was
average
there
taste
was
smokey
for
a
second
but
then
got
bittered
out
by
the
hops
some
may
like
this
one
but
i
am
more
of
a
malt
guy
average
sized
off
white
foamy
head
that
reduces
fairly
quickly
to
a
full
layer
of
foamy
lace
body
is
clear
and
copper
in
color
with
some
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
becomes
slightly
cloudy
on
last
pour
and
white
sediment
settles
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
moderately
malty
with
some
graininess
and
caramel
notes
hops
are
also
moderate
on
the
notes
with
citrus
notes
not
surprisingly
theres
a
definite
smoke
aroma
that
is
also
apparent
great
malty
start
with
slight
caramel
noticeable
the
malt
character
continues
to
be
present
throughout
smoke
flavor
comes
in
towards
the
middle
and
lasts
through
the
aftertaste
the
smoke
flavors
meld
quite
well
with
the
hop
finish
that
nicely
balances
out
the
brew
slight
roasted
notes
are
also
apparent
the
smoke
notes
seem
to
pick
up
more
as
the
brew
warms
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
enough
smoked
flavor
to
make
sure
you
know
its
there
but
not
enough
to
become
overbearing
and
make
you
loose
sight
of
the
well
balanced
malt
and
hop
character
of
the
brew
too
bad
its
not
more
readily
available
not
much
experience
with
smoked
ales
but
i
may
seek
more
after
this
pours
a
hazy
copper
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
died
quick
the
aroma
is
moderately
hoppy
with
a
good
hint
of
smoke
but
does
nothing
to
prepare
you
for
the
taste
this
beer
tastes
like
smoked
cheese
and
i
love
it
bacon
fat
and
smoked
cheese
rule
the
tongue
with
some
hops
trying
to
work
their
way
into
the
picture
balancing
things
out
this
is
by
far
the
smokiest
beer
i
have
had
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
slick
at
the
same
time
going
down
way
easy
immensly
drinkable
but
i
imagine
this
is
a
hit
or
miss
type
beer
you
either
love
it
or
you
hate
it
i
love
it
22
ounce
bottle
a
nice
tasting
beer
interesting
style
my
first
of
this
style
i
wouldnt
say
its
the
best
beer
but
its
definitely
a
good
one
and
an
interesting
one
i
must
point
out
im
no
expert
in
this
genre
of
beer
but
i
simply
cannot
recommend
a
beer
with
one
flavor
feature
so
radically
overpowering
if
you
really
feel
the
urge
to
drink
a
liquefied
sausage
this
is
your
chance
i
like
to
eat
bacon
not
eat
it
i
knew
the
beer
that
got
me
into
the
mug
club
wouldnt
taste
like
shit
i
liked
this
beer
very
tasty
nice
mouthfeel
but
thats
about
it
i
think
the
smoke
flavor
and
aromas
just
didnt
mix
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
spicy
hops
combined
with
the
smoke
to
give
a
plastic
flavor
i
couldnt
stomach
i
actually
gave
up
after
less
than
half
a
glass
and
poured
the
rest
into
the
dogs
bowl
he
couldnt
finish
it
either
my
first
true
smoke
beer
orangey
color
with
a
low
beige
head
aroma
is
distinct
beef
jerky
flavor
also
reminds
me
of
beef
jerky
with
a
touch
of
saltiness
or
am
i
imagining
that
very
light
hops
and
malt
perhaps
a
touch
in
the
finish
the
flavor
is
very
distinctly
smokey
and
all
the
way
through
the
glass
still
feels
like
tasting
a
piece
of
smoked
meat
interesting
other
screams
for
food
cuz
it
was
late
and
i
was
out
of
food
in
the
house
i
opted
for
jerky
from
the
711
i
felt
bad
having
the
bud
of
meat
with
something
of
such
good
quality
but
wow
did
it
pair
well
tastes
like
a
hop
charged
amber
ale
that
sat
in
a
wood
smoker
for
a
few
days
very
nice
more
subtle
smoke
flavor
than
the
august
schlenka
rauchbiers
i
have
had
nice
carmel
malt
sweetness
lies
underneath
with
a
bitter
snappy
hop
finish
fairly
dry
finish
but
some
hop
bitterness
and
smoke
lingers
enough
for
your
tastebuds
to
crave
another
taste
medium
to
light
bodied
flavors
are
bold
but
balanced
smokiness
is
not
overly
played
bottom
of
the
glass
yeilds
hints
of
peat
and
smokiness
akin
to
an
islay
scotch
whiskey
without
the
heat
paired
this
with
an
oven
roasted
hickory
smoked
turkey
and
swiss
sandwich
and
the
exhaust
fumes
of
the
brickyard
400
perfect
match
i
could
have
this
again
maybe
with
a
winter
time
smoked
gouda
or
nice
rubusto
on
the
back
porch
smoky
smoky
smoky
what
a
great
brew
a
dark
amber
ale
wit
ha
medium
head
that
dissolves
to
a
nice
lasting
lace
the
smoke
smell
hits
you
and
doesnt
quit
this
brew
is
like
liquid
barbecue
and
had
me
craving
some
pulled
pork
and
ribs
along
with
the
smokiness
some
spice
flavours
can
be
detected
along
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
goes
down
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
really
dug
this
brew
and
hope
to
find
it
again
real
soon
one
of
my
favourite
rouge
ales
man
another
good
brew
from
roguethis
was
my
11th
different
brew
from
these
guys
and
once
again
i
was
impressed
looked
and
tasted
similar
to
the
german
rauchenfelser
i
drink
from
time
to
time
cloudy
deep
muddy
amber
with
nice
thick
head
that
laced
nicely
aroma
is
smoky
beechwood
and
a
subtle
hopiness
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
flavor
is
nice
blend
of
the
smoked
malts
with
a
generous
dose
of
hops
bittering
nicely
but
not
overbearing
i
recommend
this
one
only
if
you
like
smoked
beers
i
happen
to
and
rogue
did
a
nice
job
with
this
offering
this
brew
has
a
smoked
sausage
aroma
medium
head
of
fine
light
brown
bubbles
above
a
tempting
cloudy
dark
brown
body
tastes
like
carbonated
sausage
too
it
also
has
a
strong
smoke
aftertaste
pellucid
light
ruby
hue
fluffy
vanilla
white
persistent
head
leaves
loose
foam
trails
mellow
smoked
malt
and
understated
toasty
munich
upfront
in
aroma
followed
by
medium
lovibond
caramel
sweetness
and
subtle
red
currant
fruitiness
overshadowed
spicy
hop
nose
surprisingly
tame
but
pleasant
aromawise
a
combination
of
caramel
malt
and
dextrin
sweetness
hits
the
palate
initially
then
is
contrasted
by
rounded
lingering
smoke
and
moderate
hop
bitterness
melanoidin
tinged
grainy
munich
malt
undertone
adds
depth
in
malt
character
hint
of
grassy
hop
flavor
adds
a
token
noble
presence
moderate
in
body
but
heavily
dextrinous
and
approaching
oily
in
mouthfeel
from
the
copious
use
of
caramel
malts
plenty
of
residual
dextrins
but
not
quite
proteinaceous
enough
as
the
beer
breathes
smoked
malt
although
not
overbearing
begins
to
envelope
the
palate
finishes
oily
smokey
and
lightly
bitter
almost
a
great
smoked
beer
it
doesnt
possess
the
depth
or
crispness
of
malt
character
demonstrated
by
schlenkerla
lagers
and
the
smoke
character
is
almost
peated
like
in
nature
rogue
smoke
is
nonetheless
a
unique
flavorful
and
enjoyable
brew
that
i
would
readily
drink
again
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
the
bottle
f
im
not
a
fan
of
most
rauchbiers
but
when
i
saw
a
rogue
bomber
i
never
tried
i
had
to
have
it
this
hazy
copper
colored
brew
has
a
medium
to
active
carbonation
that
livens
up
the
flavors
nicely
the
smoke
and
sweet
maltiness
seems
more
subdued
than
most
other
rauchbier
i
have
had
and
it
works
well
for
this
brew
the
saaz
and
perle
hops
give
a
pleasant
spicy
and
clean
finish
i
wish
i
saved
this
for
later
to
have
with
the
heavily
smoked
kielbasa
im
having
for
dinner
personally
i
did
not
like
this
beer
however
i
believe
that
it
is
probably
a
good
representation
of
the
style
pours
copper
in
color
with
small
head
slight
smell
of
smoke
taste
is
smokey
but
in
a
subdued
way
compared
to
other
smoked
ales
that
ive
had
not
as
sweet
as
other
smoked
stouts
or
smoked
ales
dont
get
the
ashy
taste
a
good
intro
to
smoked
beers
but
not
quite
the
most
unique
smoked
experience
out
there
nice
to
know
it
is
there
in
the
rogue
lineup
undated
7
oz
bottle
carefully
poured
off
of
the
yeast
its
only
slightly
hazy
the
body
is
a
deep
orangetinted
copper
a
short
foamy
head
drops
quickly
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
quite
astonishing
and
reminds
me
of
my
favorite
smoked
beer
the
alaskan
smoked
porter
also
by
john
maier
i
guess
thats
the
alderwood
but
theres
also
some
sweet
malt
there
thats
just
as
inviting
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
quite
smooth
in
the
mouth
as
theres
only
a
limited
carbonation
the
flavor
starts
with
a
rich
and
sweet
munich
and
caramel
maltiness
but
soon
gives
way
to
smokiness
very
nice
the
bitterness
rises
in
the
finish
along
with
a
palate
coating
smokiness
the
beechwood
flavor
is
noticeable
very
well
done
with
lots
of
smoke
flavor
but
not
overly
aggressive
and
cloying
some
minor
hop
flavor
is
also
present
throughout
although
i
suspect
that
this
is
an
old
bottle
thats
dulled
considerably
still
its
quite
nice
and
i
intend
to
enjoy
a
few
more
of
these
cheers
to
billy
stout
for
the
sample
i
was
given
a
pony
bottle
so
i
did
not
get
allot
but
from
what
i
got
was
as
follows
color
was
a
slight
smoke
clouded
amber
decent
yellowpalesmokey
head
the
lace
seemed
thick
and
mirrored
the
head
the
smell
had
hints
of
malt
and
smoke
the
smoke
was
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
thought
it
wouldshould
be
in
the
smell
tasted
slight
hops
chocolate
coffee
slight
sweetness
but
the
smoke
flavor
was
there
a
good
style
of
beer
and
brand
i
would
like
to
try
a
bigger
bottle
to
get
more
22
oz
bomber
pours
a
deep
hazy
amber
color
with
a
solid
wellretaining
head
smell
is
mainly
of
the
smoked
malts
taste
is
quite
smoky
with
the
typical
rogue
hop
profile
which
is
quite
robust
would
complement
foods
like
smoked
salmon
well
very
enjoyable
flavor
a
smooth
relatively
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
solid
drinkability
make
this
an
applaudable
stab
at
the
rauchbier
style
very
good
fking
hops
i
found
a
fresh
bomber
of
this
so
im
rereviewing
it
since
my
last
sample
was
past
its
prime
pours
a
wood
brown
to
amber
color
with
a
very
slight
haze
topped
with
a
creamcolored
head
that
stays
very
well
in
the
23
cm
range
a
few
splotches
cling
to
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
great
smoked
aroma
of
course
reminds
me
of
a
barbecue
maltiness
is
detectable
under
this
however
the
aroma
is
not
nearly
as
strong
as
it
was
in
my
aged
sample
in
the
flavor
the
smoke
is
much
more
subtle
than
i
expected
instead
a
targeted
and
crisp
rindlike
hop
bite
takes
center
stage
caramel
malt
is
detectable
just
under
this
and
is
more
evenly
distributed
on
the
palate
than
the
hop
character
gives
a
good
balance
between
the
two
much
better
body
than
my
last
sample
smoke
is
more
present
with
retroolfaction
and
in
the
aftertaste
although
i
expected
more
smoke
its
a
good
effort
overall
soothing
warming
and
satisfying
deep
amber
in
color
the
head
is
light
beige
the
lace
in
thin
sheets
nose
is
malt
light
hints
of
caramel
bit
of
smoke
front
is
sweet
the
top
light
the
finish
once
again
has
a
touch
of
smoke
acidic
dry
fairly
well
hopped
and
a
decent

beer
ranks
657
on
my
current
1000

master
list
slightly
hazy
dark
redamber
body
thick
rocky
creamcolored
head
very
smoky
aroma
with
slight
undertones
of
sweet
malt
i
really
cant
taste
anything
beyond
the
smoke
smooth
beer
just
too
heavy
on
the
smoke
to
be
truly
enjoyable
probably
great
with
a
turkey
sandwich
i
raised
the
scores
in
most
categories
after
drinking
a
22
oz
version
of
the
smoke
ale
its
very
drinkable
for
a
smoked
beer
the
smoke
quality
is
subtle
but
nice
great
malt
underlying
and
i
dont
get
the
huge
viscosity
that
i
got
from
the
7
ozer
notes
a
step
above
the
rest
and
an
absolute
delight
to
savour
just
a
small
warning
the
7
oz
bottle
is
not
enough
especially
if
you
are
a
smoked
ale
lover
ok
maybe
im
drinking
this
too
young
it
is
made
here
in
oregon
i
just
can
not
drink
this
stuff
it
tastes
like
liking
an
ashtray
i
like
achet
rauch
beer
but
i
just
cant
hadle
this
maybe
if
i
aged
it
out
for
6
month
to
a
year
i
like
most
of
rogues
stuff
but
not
this
theres
a
distinctive
bandaid
taste
up
front
the
malt
is
pale
with
a
hint
of
toast
the
swallow
is
distractingly
medicinal
good
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
rich
body
with
a
low
carbonationmy
favorite
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
tapered
glass
true
to
its
name
the
beer
is
straw
yellow
in
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
substantial
white
head
considerable
aroma
suggesting
smoke
fresh
rye
bread
with
a
little
yeasty
quality
like
perhaps
a
saison
or
biere
de
garde
very
promising
and
indeed
the
flavor
is
dead
on
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
totally
sessionable
lager
its
well
carbonated
and
a
very
slight
sourness
brings
some
refreshment
along
with
the
bold
grainy
flavors
of
the
rye
and
the
spicy
clove
flavors
from
the
yeast
i
would
not
have
guessed
this
is
a
lager
though
given
the
color
and
mouthfeel
it
makes
total
sense
the
abv
is
4
5
which
is
a
good
thing
because
this
thing
is
dangerously
drinkable
underrated
and
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
either
roggenbier
or
rauchbier
definitely
a
unique
beer
something
ive
not
had
before
and
wasnt
bad
fumata
is
a
standard
earthy
porter
that
borrows
the
nicer
attributes
of
americanstyle
robust
porters
and
londonstyle
brown
porters
the
rye
character
shows
a
raw
earthiness
that
supports
the
smoke
flavor
and
aroma
well
i
just
kinda
wish
there
were
more
of
it
overall
not
too
familiar
with
smoked
beer
but
this
one
was
ver
desirable
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
with
bbq
or
even
any
grilled
foods
during
the
warmer
months
i
wish
they
did
this
with
a
better
defined
malt
profile
great
smokiness
and
a
mediocre
malt
i
could
drink
this
again
but
probably
wont
a
noble
attempt
at
a
unique
blend
of
styles
though
i
would
argue
it
still
needs
a
little
ironing
out
overall
if
i
did
not
know
better
i
would
think
this
beer
was
made
in
bamburg
it
is
that
good
it
may
be
the
best
domestic
rauchsmoked
beer
i
have
had
love
the
smoke
heaviness
on
this
one
yes
i
wish
this
was
a
bit
higher
on
the
rye
but
anyone
who
likes
rauches
should
grab
this
way
better
than
the
black
from
high
and
mighty
and
i
do
like
that
beerespecially
for
rauch
like
quality
notes
a
very
interesting
beer
definitely
something
to
check
out
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
one
of
the
most
highly
hopped
smoked
beers
ive
had
i
believe
this
beer
is
miscategorized
as
a
rye
beer
here
on
ba
this
is
a
smoked
lager
that
also
contains
rye
taste
starts
with
a
light
sweetness
goes
spicy
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
the
same
medium
smoke
seen
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slick
for
my
taste
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
wish
there
was
more
smoke
to
round
it
out
pours
a
light
clear
strawgolden
color
has
a
very
nice
aroma
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
sharp
spicey
and
citrusy
its
quite
complex
for
a
easydrinking
beer
i
really
like
the
smokiness
in
the
flavor
the
spice
a
breadiness
from
the
rye
is
also
quite
satisfying
this
is
a
nice
fall
beer
and
is
a
break
from
some
of
the
bigger
malt
or
hopheavy
beers
that
overwhelm
the
shelves
these
days
it
is
nicely
restrained
yet
complex
because
its
on
the
weaker
side
it
tastes
a
bit
watery
and
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
like
if
it
were
just
beefed
up
a
tad
either
in
mouthfeel
or
malt
i
would
like
it
more
this
is
one
better
cold
in
my
opinion
as
it
warms
it
starts
to
taste
more
like
a
smoked
bud
to
me
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
this
when
i
want
an
easydrinking
but
tasty
beer
i
love
smoked
beers
too
and
this
was
pretty
interesting
a
very
interesting
beer
from
high
mighty
i
cant
really
think
of
a
beer
to
which
i
could
compare
it
perhaps
not
something
id
seek
out
again
but
a
cool
experiment
nonetheless
o
glad
to
have
this
available
and
will
continue
to
seek
it
out
well
done
to
those
high
and
mighty
folks
keep
up
the
fine
work
this
was
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
high
mighty
beers
ive
tried
but
not
exactly
my
favorite
rauchbier
all
in
all
a
very
good
intro
to
the
style
though
the
rye
is
a
nice
touch
o
overall
very
surprised
by
this
beer
was
not
expecting
this
to
work
but
the
smoke
and
rye
go
very
good
together
would
buy
this
again
but
not
something
i
could
drink
large
quantities
of
o
the
smoke
is
very
suibtle
in
this
beer
and
well
balanced
by
the
other
elements
simply
the
blackest
beer
i
have
ever
seen
if
you
liquified
charcoal
briquettes
it
might
not
be
this
black
minimal
rust
brown
head
smells
of
smoke
amd
roasted
malts
a
very
good
balance
between
the
smoke
and
the
sweetish
malt
base
some
lite
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
undertones
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
surprisingly
light
aftertaste
a
great
smoked
ale
and
a
very
good
stout
deep
dark
brown
in
color
nice
blend
of
roast
and
smoke
on
the
nose
the
smoke
does
not
get
out
of
control
yet
it
outpaces
the
roasted
malts
in
the
flavor
profile
there
is
a
healthy
body
with
a
little
creaminess
far
too
smoky
for
my
palette
it
was
a
good
take
on
the
style
but
just
a
bit
too
smoky
in
taste
and
nose
not
one
i
would
try
again
12oz
bottle
poured
into
stout
snifter
opaque
black
with
just
a
hint
of
brown
at
the
stem
of
the
glass
a
onefinger
brown
head
forms
and
slowly
falls
to
a
ring
no
lacing
the
aroma
features
smoked
malt
roasted
coffee
bakers
chocolate
and
molasses
overall
the
nose
is
mild
and
the
smoke
specifically
is
subtle
fores
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
slight
roasted
malt
molasses
and
chocolate
sweetness
followed
by
coffee
and
char
bitterness
the
smoke
comes
faintly
on
the
finish
medium
body
creamy
texture
moderate
carbonation
and
a
long
bitter
finish
with
some
smoke
a
solid
somewhat
boozy
stout
the
smoke
flavor
is
very
subtle
with
just
a
hint
of
smoke
coming
through
for
me
the
smoke
is
clearer
in
the
smell
than
the
taste
i
think
thats
a
good
thing
a
little
sweetness
and
a
nice
earthy
flavor
a
little
raisin
and
licorice
flavor
is
in
this
brew
an
interesting
and
unique
stout
i
enjoy
it
enough
that
i
buy
two
or
three
4packs
every
time
it
comes
in
season
nice
smoky
flavor
with
very
little
after
taste
another
winner
from
dark
horse
run
of
the
mill
craft
stout
eventually
the
peat
influence
permeates
its
way
throughout
before
all
is
said
and
done
youre
sure
to
be
smelling
a
trace
of
composting
vegetal
matter
alongside
all
those
acrid
and
smoky
coffee
beans
its
subtle
enough
to
be
unnoticed
or
ignored
if
desired
to
but
for
me
as
a
lover
of
islay
scotches
as
well
as
strong
stouts
its
what
makes
this
one
come
out
on
top
loved
it
this
was
the
first
beer
i
chose
on
my
21st
it
was
great
in
flavor
and
smooth
body
i
was
not
disappointed
pours
black
with
a
brown
head
aroma
of
coffee
espresso
chocolate
roast
and
little
bit
smoke
aroma
is
more
chocolate
very
light
smoked
coffee
low
body
good
stuff
not
special
really
like
how
the
smoke
is
done
in
this
doesnt
overpower
but
compliments
very
well
overall
a
good
affordable
goto
when
you
just
gotta
have
smoked
stout
medium
to
full
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
there
is
a
light
smoked
malt
aftertaste
very
easy
to
drink
worth
buying
again
for
sure
i
was
anxious
to
begin
and
gave
it
a
pretty
heavyhanded
pour
before
sitting
back
to
watch
the
pseudocascade
it
settled
pretty
quickly
into
two
fingers
of
deeptanlightbrown
head
but
what
happened
next
was
particularly
remarkable
it
seemed
to
collapse
inwardly
on
itself
and
fell
much
more
quickly
than
i
expected
becoming
mere
wisps
color
was
opaque
black
srm
44
allowing
zero
light
penetration
nose
was
very
smoky
but
in
more
of
a
burnt
charcoal
way
than
the
smokiness
of
a
rauchbier
mouthfeel
was
medium
the
taste
was
more
like
bittersweet
chocolate
mingled
with
a
sweet
smokiness
it
kind
of
put
me
in
mind
of
chocolatecovered
bacon
which
i
have
tried
i
am
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
this
was
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
like
especially
since
it
seemed
to
be
getting
in
the
way
of
the
smokiness
finish
had
that
same
bittersweet
smokiness
that
i
had
been
getting
throughout
i
was
really
kind
of
underwhelmed
especially
given
the
hype
and
scores
assigned
to
this
beer
not
bad
per
se
but
leaving
a
lot
of
room
for
improvement
an
excellent
complex
but
very
drinkable
smoked
stout
o
not
bad
for
a
smoked
stout
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
have
every
day
o
this
is
kind
of
one
note
the
smoke
is
smothering
anything
more
complex
i
know
it
is
a
smoked
stout
so
that
should
be
the
expectation
but
i
hoped
for
some
other
flavors
somewhere
in
the
palate
it
is
decent
tasting
but
lacks
a
strong
nose
and
depth
int
he
taste
o
but
for
the
lackluster
head
this
is
a
beautiful
stout
the
smoke
was
weaker
in
both
aroma
and
taste
than
id
hoped
or
at
least
seemed
that
way
next
to
the
potency
of
a
stout
that
nears
imperial
status
enjoyable
but
not
a
home
run
overall
this
is
a
tasty
stout
however
with
the
smoke
not
playing
much
of
a
part
and
the
relatively
light
body
compared
to
the
sweetness
of
the
flavor
you
could
be
convinced
this
was
a
chocolate
porter
or
something
perhaps
id
like
more
smoke
from
a
smoked
stout
but
its
still
tasty
and
interesting

very
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
the
char
is
just
enough
to
let
you
know
its
smoked
it
never
crosses
the
line
abv
on
the
bottle
is
listed
at
7
but
its
so
smooth
you
wouldnt
know
it
good
beer
mouthfeel
thick
and
kind
of
syrup
like
spot
on
for
a
good
stout
i
would
have
liked
a
tad
more
carbonation
but
thats
just
personal
preference
it
borderline
flat
schmokin
beers
beers
beers
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
a
nice
stout
with
a
medium
amount
of
smoke
pours
an
impenetrable
black
body
with
a
small
brown
head
with
decent
retention
aromas
are
predominantly
of
a
charry
smoke
and
dark
chocolate
garnache
reminiscent
of
a
burnt
smore
the
aromas
come
through
in
a
big
and
literal
way
on
the
front
and
midpalates
with
a
sweet
and
smoky
finish
that
lingers
long
pleasantly
full
bodied
with
warm
alcoholic
tingle
assertive
without
being
so
heavy
handed
on
the
smokiness
that
you
want
to
quit
halfway
through
i
personally
do
not
know
why
i
tried
this
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
very
smoky
coffee
type
of
beer
with
chocolate
undertones
this
is
the
beer
for
you
the
aroma
starts
of
hitting
you
with
the
smokey
nose
along
with
the
coffee
appearance
it
is
a
thicker
beer
that
is
filled
with
flavors
just
not
the
flavors
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
dark
rich
color
that
hits
you
right
away
with
the
smoke
the
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
undertones
then
come
through
very
vibrantly
the
aroma
is
full
and
rich
the
creaminess
of
this
beer
is
evident
from
the
site
of
the
pour
the
appearance
is
very
dark
drown
almost
black
very
rich
and
flavorful
stout
excellent
choice
for
this
style
of
beer
its
amazing
to
me
that
i
have
not
had
this
beer
until
today
pours
into
a
nonic
nearly
jet
black
except
for
a
deep
chesnut
brown
tinge
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
deep
mocha
colored
head
atop
the
smoke
stands
out
but
is
not
in
your
face
that
along
with
molasses
and
dark
roast
coffee
make
up
the
nose
mostly
a
fuler
but
more
mellow
mouthfeel
with
molasses
and
dark
roast
coffee
flavors
over
top
of
mild
hardwood
smoke
the
smoke
plays
a
role
but
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
wich
i
thought
would
be
the
casesolid
the
feel
is
easy
and
light
with
a
touch
of
wateriness
but
overall
this
is
a
beer
with
good
character
pours
a
rich
black
with
a
half
finger
of
brown
head
that
almost
immediately
fades
to
naught
initially
im
not
getting
any
smoke
on
the
nose
definitely
some
roasted
coffee
sugar
cream
and
hints
of
vanilla
and
cocoa
there
though
not
nearly
as
menacing
as
the
name
led
me
to
assume
the
beer
tastes
pretty
mild
as
far
as
the
smoke
is
concerned
also
i
dont
get
any
of
the
acrid
or
astringent
flavors
sometimes
found
in
heavily
roasted
smoked
beers
roasted
barley
and
char
more
than
smoke
come
out
front
then
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
semidark
chocolate
come
out
midway
and
last
through
the
finish
pours
a
heavy
motor
oil
color
with
only
some
sparse
creamy
brown
wisps
on
top
damn
these
guys
really
like
to
make
their
stouts
dark
somewhat
subdued
smoky
malt
aromas
combine
nicely
with
softly
sweet
chocolaty
roast
and
berries
deliciously
malty
flavor
the
smoke
isnt
really
center
stage
but
rather
supporting
the
rich
dark
chocolate
and
cutting
the
sweetness
with
a
bitter
espresso
and
campfire
finish
pleasant
tobacco
and
dark
fruity
undertones
medium
bodied
and
fairly
low
on
carbonation
ive
enjoyed
every
single
one
of
these
dark
horse
stouts
well
done
ounlike
other
smoked
beers
the
smoke
is
not
overpowering
here
the
third
best
of
the
stout
series
i
get
very
minimal
smoke
off
this
beer
its
an
accent
at
best
which
i
appreciate
the
beer
as
a
stout
is
very
solid
robust
and
rich
there
are
thick
malts
that
really
rest
in
the
mouth
well
smooth
feel
easy
to
drink
not
sure
what
else
you
could
ask
for
in
a
stout
for
this
some
people
might
want
more
smoke
but
for
me
i
am
happy
with
it
a
very
good
stout
i
wanted
to
rate
it
higher
but
it
just
didnt
bring
the
smoke
it
is
very
earthy
and
has
charcoal
notes
but
lacks
the
smoke
still
worth
a
purchase
what
it
lacks
in
smoke
aroma
it
makes
up
for
in
flavor
but
the
quality
of
smoke
was
disappointing
wouldve
preferred
less
ashtray
and
more
hardwood
theres
a
touch
of
acrid
flavor
thats
offputting
this
is
an
overall
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
showcase
any
smoke
in
my
opinion
i
think
this
definitely
a
nice
simple
stout
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
smoke
forward
and
unique
i
may
revisit
in
the
future
for
now
im
on
the
fence
overall
this
one
was
better
than
expected
i
got
tres
blueberry
in
the
same
mix
six
and
was
very
disappointed
with
that
one
this
one
has
nice
balance
and
a
good
mouthfeel
and
appearance
that
makes
it
a
really
good
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
slightly
smokey
and
nicely
balanced
roasted
malts
this
one
will
take
you
there
fore
is
dedicated
and
direct
in
its
focus
not
allowing
any
distraction
from
fruit
spice
or
any
other
peripheral
characteristics
its
roast
character
shows
great
discipline
and
power
its
a
fantastic
display
in
the
use
of
smoke
with
balance

very

on

and

that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
smoked
stout
very
robust
and
balanced
with
roasted
flavors
and
smokiness
and
extremely
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
d
the
aroma
doesnt
exhibit
enough
smoke
but
the
taste
doesnt
balance
it
enough
would
revisit
but
probably
not
with
any
further
expectations
overall
not
bad
not
overly
smokey
like
most
smoked
beers
ive
had
rather
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
pretty
good
beer
with
a
little
sweet
kick
worth
a
drink
espically
for
people
that
have
had
smoked
beers
and
found
them
overbearing
o
overall
my
first
smoked
beer
it
was
good
and
would
pair
well
with
a
bacon
sandwich
nothing
amazing
however
overall
id
recommend
it
its
great
on
a
winter
night
and
i
think
id
like
it
better
paired
with
red
meat
overall
loved
how
this
beer
tastes
and
smells
the
beer
needs
some
work
in
a
few
other
areas
though
i
would
not
hesitate
to
by
a
4
pack
of
this
beer
fresh
overall
good
to
have
found
the
fourth
installment
of
the
series
the
pour
is
chocolate
milk
thick
with
a
thin
but
yet
rich
head
scents
of
burnt
chocolate
coffee
cocoa
and
toasted
malts
great
scented
like
a
classic
stout
tastes
robust
a
bit
thin
no
hops
but
a
nice
smokechard
finish
that
is
easy
to
drink
a
bit
thin
but
yet
likeable
and
strong
with
accented
maltsmoked
flavour
very
easy
to
finish
yet
extremely
strong
the
longer
you
drink
it
the
more
accentuated
the
smoke
because
which
i
find
intriguing
and
different
i
have
no
complaints
about
this
one
as
it
was
nicely
priced
and
lived
up
to
the
billing
ive
enjoyed
dark
horse
brews
before
but
was
still
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
my
favorite
smoked
stouts
black
and
inky
with
no
foam
smells
of
smoke
leather
tobacco
toasted
and
roasted
malts
flavor
is
roasted
with
smoke
coffee
grounds
leather
metal
and
some
dust
okay
flavor
medium
on
full
bodied
with
low
on
moderate
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
this
was
less
smoky
than
i
expected
a
good
thing
but
the
stout
underneath
lacked
the
refined
character
i
usually
get
from
the
folks
at
dark
horse
im
not
100
convinced
that
this
stout
works
with
the
smoked
peat
but
it
is
none
the
least
quite
good
perhaps
it
something
i
need
to
get
used
to
a
bit
or
maybe
its
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
almost
a
year
old
being
it
number
4
in
there
series
what
ever
o
this
was
a
very
flavorful
stout
and
for
fans
of
smoky
tasting
beers
this
one
really
delivers
on
the
smokiness
along
with
an
outstanding
stout
it
had
a
very
appealing
malt
sweetness
that
was
balanced
by
a
dark
roasted
bitterness
that
resulted
in
a
coffee
and
cream
quality
and
all
of
this
was
enhanced
by
a
touch
of
peat
smoke
that
added
a
pleasing
level
of
complexity
overall
nicee
stout
with
some
great
smoke
that
doesnt
take
over
like
in
so
many
smoked
beers
nice
stuff
o
works
better
as
a
porter
than
a
stout
completely
fails
as
a
rauchbier
the
smoke
is
so
incredibly
faint
that
its
barely
recognizable
as
roasted
malts
at
all
average
beer
but
still
quite
drinkable
overall
good
beer
as
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
very
well
integrated
at
this
point
a
more
impressive
head
and
a
bigger
palate
would
help
give
this
one
the
push
it
so
deserves
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
drink
as
it
is
would
gladly
drink
again
cheers
for
the
bottle
thetomg
o
this
stout
is
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
even
though
there
are
lots
of
rich
malty
flavors
o
a
good
beer
with
lots
of
nice
roasted
and
smokey
characteristics
id
like
the
smoke
to
be
a
bit
more
present
but
its
still
tasty
and
enjoyable
o
smoke
and
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
coffee
best
describe
this
assertive
beer
there
is
a
depth
of
flavors
and
aromas
but
all
supporting
three
main
characteristics
o
really
good
beer
should
have
reviewed
this
months
ago
when
the
weather
was
more
appropriate
though
the
taste
has
a
nice
woody
note
with
good
sweet
malt
backing
and
body
with
light
tinge
of
spice
and
mild
toffee
mixed
with
smoke
and
gentle
fruity
flavor
in
the
yeast
which
adds
complexity
to
the
sweet
woody
and
smoked
jerkylike
almost
cinnamon
earthy
component
the
flavor
gets
more
roasted
with
some
dark
sugar
as
it
warms
with
smoke
flavor
and
subtle
raisin
tinge
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
way
more
drinkable
than
it
should
be
for
8
it
drinks
like
6
maybe
the
smoke
could
be
more
forward
but
then
again
i
appreciate
the
balance
this
has
an
extremely
well
crafted
drinkable
stout
one
of
the
best
smoke
brews
ive
had
recommended
this
rounds
out
the
five
fore
me
theyre
all
great
but
i
prefer
the
others

as
i
had
anticipated
however
would
revisit
beer
is
medium

and
less

than
youd
expect
after
the
nose
it
is
a
nice
beer
overall
but
not
my
favorite
id
probably
have
it
again
delicious
o
overall
a
good
stout
i
tend
to
get
overpowered
by
heavy
handed
use
of
smoked
malt
but
this
does
stay
in
control
and
well
balanced
smoke
accents
instead
of
taking
over
the
other
flavors
here
probably
not
something
i
will
run
and
and
buy
regularly
but
will
probably
revisit
occasionally
especially
in
cooler
weather
this
beer
also
slows
smoothly
having
a
light
carbonation
all
the
way
through
as
well
as
a
nice
creaminess
that
comes
into
play
from
middle
to
finish
the
body
is
appropriately
heavy
without
sitting
heavily
overall
a
fine
stout
wish
it
was
a
bit
smokier
kinda
comes
off
as
just
a
stout
with
more
roasted
malt
than
usual
rather
than
a
smoked
stout
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
overall
a
very
good
stout
smoke
elements
could
of
been
a
little
stronger
but
the
dark
malts
are
really
great
almost
as
robust
as
an
imperial
stout
overall
solid
unique
brew
when
im
feeling
up
for
a
smoked
heavier
brew
ill
look
for
this
when
it
comes
around
next
year
pour
is
pitch
black
thick
and
off
white
head
it
smells
like
founders
is
thick
leather
and
soy
sauce
smell
and
flavors
its
a
touch
lighter
than
fis
though
balanced
heavy
flavors
but
not
too
heavy
the
smoke
isnt
too
much
its
more
of
a
nice
accent
to
the
heavy
roasted
and
toasted
malts
it
looks
like
motor
oil
hell
it
event
tastes
like
it
more
of
a
stout
than
rauchbier
but
oh
well
pours
thick
dark
and
opaque
very
dark
khaki
head
but
thin
and
fades
fast
smell
is
of
roasted
chocolate
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
the
taste
is
very
good
lots
of
chocolate
throughout
sweet
and
some
bitter
nice
roasted
flavors
mixed
in
at
the
end
with
a
woodsy
almost
burnt
taste
still
on
the
subtle
side
medium
body
low
carbonation
very
tasty
beer
love
the
chocolate
with
the
different
dimension
of
smoked
added
to
it
would
love
another
one
m
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
has
a
bit
of
an
oily
quality
to
the
texture
but
the
abv
is
masked
quite
well
the
color
of
the
pour
resembles
motor
oil
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
looks
like
bubbly
chocolate
milk
the
smell
of
chocolate
dominates
with
slight
undertones
of
smoked
wood
chocolate
malt
up
front
transitioning
to
hroasted
malt
that
finishes
with
slightly
bitter
woody
smokiness
wonderful
mouthfeel
much
more
creamy
than
expected
with
lush
carbonation
a
very
enjoyable
smoked
stout
the
smoke
complements
the
other
flavors
that
are
present
and
never
dominates
adding
complexity
to
this
solid
brew
body
is
medium
with
an
appropriate
carbonation
level
texture
is
never
too
prickly
or
syrupy
dryness
in
the
finish
i
was
shocked
to
see
the
abv
at
8
because
its
never
noticeable
the
wellmasked
alcohol
and
subtle
smoke
make
this
a
very
very
easy
drinker
for
the
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
2
i
recently
had
the
most
interesting
smoked
beer
of
my
life
it
was
this
european
smoked
beer
and
it
legitimately
smelled
like
bacon
it
has
had
a
pretty
meaty
taste
flavor
is
malty
and
roasty
to
start
then
turns
smokey
but
still
retains
its
roasted
malt
backbone
i
normally
hate
smoked
beers
but
this
isnt
that
bad
the
gf
loves
it
though
so
as
long
as
shes
happy
im
happy
overall
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
smoke
builds
over
time
but
well
done
overall
id
love
to
drink
all
five
of
these
in
a
horizontal
pitch
black
pour
with
a
wicked
looking
deep
reddish
brown
head
but
doesnt
stand
long
legs
stick
all
over
the
glass
moreso
than
i
would
think
for
8
booze
in
the
glass
the
beer
just
looks
flat
though
limp
wet
noodle
erectile
dysfunction
no
lacing
anywhere
aroma
is
beautiful
doting
touches
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
in
the
midst
of
roasted
smoked
wood
caramel
toffee
and
booze
are
also
detectable
and
create
a
well
rounded
nose
caramel
smoked
wood
hit
up
front
with
a
strong
combination
of
dark
chocolates
and
alcohol
heat
in
the
back
carbonation
is
about
right
here
but
the
body
is
too
thin
in
my
opinion
and
would
match
the
smoked
character
better
with
some
more
meat
to
it
a
tasty
smoked
stout
i
like
the
balance
the
smoke
doesnt
overpower
the
other
elements
of
the
beer
but
complements
them
really
well
very
enjoyable
do
this
stout
is
a
fine
if
relatively
strong
example
of
export
stoutbut
its
smoked
qualities
hardly
define
it
this
is
the
first
of
dark
horses
numbered
series
of
stouts
that
i
have
had
and
i
cant
help
but
wonder
just
how
similar
they
are
to
each
other
in
the
final
tally
it
is
particularly
maltfocused
and
still
remains
easy
to
drink
as
usual
this
is
another
well
crafted
offering
from
dark
horse
im
telling
ya
these
people
know
their
stuff
o
decent
stout
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
taste
which
demonstrates
the
finer
qualities
of
a
roasty
stout
brewed
with
some
fruit
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
a
regular
stout
i
dont
know
where
the
smoke
comes
in
as
a
big
portion
of
it
but
its
still
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
pretty
decent
smoked
stout
i
think
its
a
little
too
smokey
they
could
dial
that
back
a
bit
but
the
stout
base
beer
is
quite
good
its
worth
a
try
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
o
very
nice
but
could
only
drink
one
per
session
still
working
my
way
through
these
seasonal
stouts
this
has
been
taking
me
way
the
hell
too
long
this
one
pours
a
straight
oily
black
topped
by
a
small
bit
o
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
dark
hickory
smoke
molasses
and
a
touch
of
dark
cocoa
powder
the
taste
generally
follows
suit
though
the
smoke
comes
off
more
hickorystyle
this
time
drying
things
out
a
bit
and
distracting
from
the
rest
of
the
flavors
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
smoked
stout
though
one
that
could
do
with
a
touch
more
balance
if
it
wants
to
be
truly
great
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
the
smoke
works
well
here
and
is
nicely
balanced
another
solid
stout
from
dark
horse
tough
style
to
nail
this
is
still
a
good
example
tasty
and
comforting
average
nothing
really
special
especially
compared
to
dark
horses
other
stouts
like
plead
the
5th
one
too
o
a
good
beer
not
as
smoky
as
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
called
smoked
but
still
has
solid
bold
flavor
with
a
hearty
thick
feel
a
filling
beer
overall
i
really
enjoy
all
the
dark
horse
winter
stouts
especially
this
one
but
wish
they
would
fix
the
thin
mouthfeel
by
increasing
the
mash
temp
or
switching
to
a
less
attenuating
yeast
the
mouthfeel
appears
to
hurt
this
one
more
than
othe
others
in
the
series
i
rememeber
this
being
a
little
smootherr
maybe
it
needs
some
time
to
sit
an
rest
the
dark
horse
fore
smoked
stout
was
a
decent
stout
the
beer
poured
pitch
black
with
tan
head
the
smell
was
one
of
cigarette
smoke
and
coffee
like
a
high
school
librarian
the
taste
followed
the
smell
quite
closely
the
mouthfeel
was
a
full
body
beer
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
stout
and
should
bring
back
memories
of
old
221
need
to
make
an
update
to
this
review
and
a
big
shout
out
to
my
northside
brew
expert
c
brown
who
says
you
got
da
roll
dat
bottle
indeed
take
the
time
to
roll
fore
so
the
sediment
will
pour
which
will
greatly
enhance
the
taste
of
this
brew
o
fore
is
a
nice
smoked
beer
ill
probably
buy
a
future
batch
to
compare
a
fresh
bottle
o
awesome
subtle
smoke
beer
pretty
much
a
stout
in
my
opinion
with
smoky
characteristics
which
is
perfect
for
this
beer
o
maybe
my
favorite
so
far
the
perfect
amount
smoke
o
i
like
this
beer
but
it
has
a
few
quirks
the
saltiness
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
much
the
smokiness
is
there
and
the
malty
sweetness
is
spot
on
but
there
is
something
about
this
that
im
not
totally
convinced
makes
it
a
great
beer
o
very
well
done
smoked
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
light
enough
that
it
doesnt
overpower
the
palate
which
makes
it
quite
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
to
def
try
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
i
failed
to
detect
a
smoke
presence
perhaps
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
and
the
smoke
faded
nevertheless
it
is
quite
good
o
a
pretty
decent
stout
definitely
not
for
someone
that
is
looking
for
a
touch
of
smokiness
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
aasher
for
this
one
fourth
in
the
series
and
fourth
on
the
day
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
poured
pitch
black
with
a
half
finger
light
brown
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
smoke
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
smoke
smoked
meat
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
now
this
is
more
like
it
i
have
been
becoming
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
lately
and
this
was
a
good
example
of
why
the
smoke
notes
on
this
one
were
really
nice
and
well
integrated
with
the
rest
of
the
brew
i
wish
the
aroma
would
have
carried
more
of
the
smokiness
aspect
as
the
flavor
did
but
that
is
just
me
being
picky
a
nicely
done
brew
o
solid
beer
very
good
beer
overall
smoked
notes
are
subtle
with
the
smokiness
coming
in
on
the
back
end
and
is
a
very
deep
smokiness
overall
this
was
a
beer
that
i
picked
up
simply
due
to
the
fact
that
dark
horse
made
it
i
can
say
that
its
quite
nice
even
though
im
a
bit
indifferent
to
smoked
beers
i
think
it
would
definitely
hit
the
mark
for
people
who
love
smokiness
and
a
nice
ris
this
is
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
tried
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
smokiness
so
that
its
tasty
and
not
like
a
distilled
campfire
thanks
to
jmarsh123
for
this
one
so
good
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
i
know
a
lot
of
people
love
liquid
smoke
in
their
smoky
beers
i
love
a
nicely
balanced
subtle
smoke
flavor
especially
in
the
darker
beers
i
think
this
beer
delivers
that
its
not
anything
out
of
this
world
but
it
delivers
exactly
what
it
promises
this
one
was
ok
but
i
think
its
in
a
nomans
land
too
smoky
for
people
who
dont
like
smoked
beers
not
smoky
enough
for
those
who
do
overall
i
dont
think
im
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
his
one
isnt
bad
and
i
would
turn
down
a
free
one
ever
i
think
the
intense
carbonation
makes
this
one
a
little
more
undesirable
for
me
overall
i
rather
liked
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
its
something
id
like
to
have
one
of
after
a
steak
dinner
and
more
of
a
winter
beer
for
me
o
its
a
nice
beer
with
chili
maybe
but
really
its
high
abv
keeps
it
from
being
a
more
than
one
in
a
night
kinda
thing
medium
to
full
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
is
about
as
refreshing
as
a
thick
stout
can
get
the
body
seems
to
be
just
right
as
it
does
not
become
syrupy
or
excessively
sticky
but
does
coat
your
mouth
well
the
carbonation
is
rather
fizzy
for
a
stout
but
does
not
take
away
from
the
flavors
nor
does
it
make
the
beer
feel
light
good
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
with
smoke
and
some
burnt
sugar
an
okay
smoke
stout
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
smoke
o
ive
not
had
a
better
smoke
stout
this
one
is
intense
and
delicious
always
impressed
with
dark
horse
sorry
theyre
not
distributed
more
widely
an
inky
jet
black
with
a
thin
but
very
dark
brown
head
leaving
a
light
bubbly
ring
of
lace
aroma
is
excellent
with
big
notes
of
roasted
malts
smokey
campfire
wood
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
peat
with
just
a
touch
of
soil
and
caramel
flavor
is
wonderful
with
big
fudgy
dark
chocolate
roast
malts
burnt
toast
and
light
coffee
notes
up
front
that
blend
seamlessly
into
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
smokey
ash
on
the
back
end
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
lingering
smokey
cocoa
finish
overall
and
damn
nice
smoked
stout
this
is
a
solid
smoked
stout
i
really
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
smoke
is
not
overwhelming
allowing
other
areas
of
the
stout
to
come
through
completely
black
with
small
tan
head
no
lacing
smells
dark
fruits
raisins
coffee
smoke
tastes
sweet
but
a
bit
coffee
flavoracidic
lingers
not
as
smokey
as
it
could
be
tastes
more
as
a
roast
feel
is
watery
and
smooth
not
too
thick
but
filmy
overall
good
stout
well
hidden
alcohol
but
not
as
smokey
as
would
like
as
a
beer
as
a
sweeter
stout
this
is
pretty
damn
tasty
but
the
smoke
is
pretty
reserved
im
not
seeing
it
as
to
style
the
chocolate
and
coffee
dominate
the
smoke
is
there
but
could
easily
be
confused
with
the
roast
expected
in
a
stout
still
very
strong
brew
o
i
think
this
one
would
be
even
better
in
the
winter
or
fall
but
i
had
it
in
and
forgot
about
it
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
even
on
a
hot
july
night
it
tastes
good
o
a
stellar
offering
from
dark
horse
id
like
to
find
some
bottles
of
it
but
i
doubt
itll
be
any
match
for
draft
o
pretty
good
but
the
flavor
doesnt
hold
up
to
what
the
aroma
suggests
however
i
find
it
rather
enjoyable
it
works
in
a
different
way
from
the
german
versions
i
like
but
the
burnt
taste
is
still
there
i
would
buy
this
again
as
a
less
expensive
alternative
to
the
germans
i
wish
i
had
some
of
my
extra
dark
pretzels
left
they
would
go
well
with
this
overall
4
pretty
drinkable
for
its
abv
with
no
sign
of
the
heat
which
is
slight
perceptible
in
the
nose
until
maybe
the
very
end
of
the
aftertaste
the
smoke
just
isnt
there
these
bottle
are
a
few
months
old
at
his
point
and
i
remember
earlier
tastings
having
a
bit
more
of
that
character
fine
by
me
though
a
damn
good
imperial
sweet
stout
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
high
acidity
and
medium
finish
overall
not
bad
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
in
for
the
smokey
flavors
are
contrasted
by
some
smooth
sweet
vanilla
and
milk
chocolate
and
some
dark
chocolates
finishes
rather
dry
handsome
dark
color
in
the
glass
with
mahogany
around
the
edges
nice
head
and
lacing
around
the
glass
a
creamy
feel
to
it
improves
with
a
little
air
and
warming
rich
roasted
flavors
just
a
touch
of
burnt
malt
with
most
of
the
flavors
in
the
chocolate
range
hops
are
modest
but
just
the
right
touch
a
robust
malty
beer
but
manages
to
be
refreshing
at
the
same
time
a
winner
in
my
book
pours
silky
black
with
minimal
quickly
dissipating
head
aroma
is
smoke
of
course
with
roasty
slightly
sweet
chocolate
notes
following
tasting
it
the
smoke
is
there
but
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
notes
finish
is
smoky
and
bitter
and
hangs
around
awhile
which
surprises
me
because
it
drank
rather
thin
really
good
beer
and
really
good
stout
but
honestly
i
have
had
better
examples
of
smoked
beers
seems
to
be
missing
something
o
quite
nice
smoked
beers
can
be
very
hit
or
miss
and
this
one
is
certainly
on
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
to
round
things
out
a
barrel
aged
version
of
this
would
be
heavenly
o
i
liked
it
really
easy
to
drink
lacks
the
complexity
i
had
hoped
for
but
i
would
gladly
drink
this
one
again
overall
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
smoke
a
good
beer
and
i
would
have
another
given
the
chance
overall
this
is
a
nice
smoked
beer
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
necessarily
but
i
would
be
more
than
open
to
a
future
revisit
thinner
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
bit
dry
somewhat
watery
for
my
tastes
this
was
okay
but
i
thought
the
smoke
was
too
light
and
the
body
too
thin
drinkability
is
good
its
not
too
smoky
nice
and
robust
and
east
drinking
glad
ive
got
another

of

epic
mealtime
son
burnt
roast

for
the
haters
it
tastes
like
char
and
chocolate
malt
with
smoke
flavor
added
feels
like
im
chewing
it
down
a
liquid
supper
beautiful
this
beer
isnt
my
style
but
i
like
it
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
1
inch
dark
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
no
lacing
whatsoever
smells
of
smoked
malt
dark
chocolate
and
slight
coffee
beans
tastes
of
the
smoked
malt
first
and
foremost
followed
by
a
subdued
chocolate
and
ground
coffee
bean
taste
there
is
a
campfiresmoke
aftertaste
on
this
beer
which
i
am
really
liking
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
with
a
very
nice
smoked
quality
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
motor
oil
black
it
may
be
categorized
here
as
a
smoked
beer
but
this
has
the
rich
sexy
dark
brown
foam
and
black
body
of
an
amazing
stout
the
aromatics
are
mostly
roasted
coffee
and
some
peat
and
wood
smoke
the
flavor
is
a
pretty
damn
good
mixture
of
chocolate
malt
roasted
malt
oatmeal
and
some
smoked
malts
the
great
thing
about
this
beer
is
there
is
enough
smoked
malts
that
they
are
prominent
in
the
flavor
of
the
stout
without
going
into
a
dominant
role
it
drinks
pretty
darn
smooth
its
a
thick
beer
to
take
down
and
itll
fill
you
up
right
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
im
disappointed
that
it
doesnt
get
more
love
o
d
a
good
dry
stout
its
not
as
smoky
in
the
taste
as
id
expected
but
its
certainly
there
i
will
call
this
decent
pours
dark
not
very
thick
decent
head
looks
like
a
standard
stout
smell
is
roasty
some
chocolate
maybe
a
little
bit
of
smoke
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
tastes
roasty
some
bitter
chocolate
and
a
slight
smokiness
more
like
a
smokey
coffee
than
the
smoked
meat
taste
that
i
would
associate
with
the
serious
smoked
beers
overall
this
is
a
tasty
stout
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
for
the
price
but
it
could
have
been
better
for
my
tastes
overall
this
is
a
delicious
smoked
stout
that
is
not
overpowered
by
the
smoke
it
strictly
serves
as
a
compliment
to
the
other
flavors
and
aromas
which
is
rare
in
a
smoked
beer
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
this
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
even
for
those
who
are
not
crazy
about
smoked
beers
overall
pretty
solid
its
the
nose
on
this
that
i
enjoy
the
most
quite
complex
and
fascinating
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
it
didnt
wow
me
like
the
other
stouts
from
the
series
but
it
was
still
a
good
solid
american
stout
i
liked
most
things
about
this
beer
but
i
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
and
i
wish
it
had
more
smoke
to
it
other
then
that
it
was
pretty
solid
i
can
see
myself
getting
another
four
pack
when
it
is
released
next
year
but
i
am
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
one
down
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
smoked
beer
you
will
probably
pretty
disappointed
with
fore
but
if
you
want
a
good
robust
slightly
smoky
american
stout
then
this
beer
will
fit
the
bill
im
glad
i
knocked
out
another
stout
from
the
series
all
i
have
left
to
try
is
one
oatmeal
stout
and
plead
the
fifth
dark
horse
makes
some
solid
stouts
thats
for
sure
overall
right
now
i
am
kicking
myself
since
i
didnt
grab
an
extra
bottle
or
two
of
this
another
great
offering
and
i
am
loving
there
beers
more
and
more
definitely
cant
wait
to
see
what
beer
hits
my
ds
six
packs
next
since
its
the
only
place
in
town
carrying
these
fantastic
beers
smokey
good
dark
horse
team
o
im
liking
this
beer
theres
just
enough
smoke
in
it
to
keep
me
happy
sure
id
like
more
smoke
but
its
getting
the
job
done
in
the
flavor
department
making
it
worthy
to
pick
up
if
you
find
it
around
harsher
than
the
smell
indicates
strong
black
patent
component
very
close
to
an
irish
stout
in
terms
of
the
dryness
i
do
not
detect
any
smokiness
the
body
is
on
the
thinnish
side
the
carbonation
above
average
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
in
a
burnt
sense
drinkability
is
okay
a
chocolatey
stout
but
lacking
the
smoke
i
expected
by
the
name
average
overall
this
is
another
solid
brew
from
dark
hose
skål
a
pretty
tasty
stout
that
stands
out
compared
to
other
american
stouts
some
flaws
mainly
texturally
but
a
decent
offering
certainly
a
nice
introduction
to
dark
horse
overall
really
decent
beer
from
dark
horse
these
guys
are
making
some
decent
stouts
and
this
is
no
exception
looking
forward
to
trying
the
remainder
of
the
series
of
5
overall
very
good
stout
overall
the
charred
notes
add
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
to
what
would
have
otherwise
been
a
fairly
straightforward
stout
fore
o
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
i
usually
dont
go
for
the
smoke
brews
but
i
might
have
to
reconsider
after
this
dark
horse
is
doing
some
really
good
things
with
their
stouts
skal
o
i
appreciated
the
balanced
level
of
smokiness
present
here
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
well
overall
this
is
just
slightly
better
than
average
and
i
have
to
say
im
disappointed
the
too
cream
was
better
and
i
actually
expected
to
like
the
fore
more
owell
another
great
stout
the
foreth
one
in
a
row
heh
i
personally
would
have
preferred
it
a
bit
smokier
but
it
sort
of
worked
its
way
in
nicely
with
some
warmth
keep
it
up
on
this
series
this
pours
impenetrable
black
with
a
one
finger
tight
mocha
head
that
leaves
no
lace
it
almost
looks
like
its
on
nitro
on
the
nose
there
is
a
great
combination
of
deeply
bitter
chocolate
with
some
clean
smoke
this
isnt
like
the
peat
smoke
im
used
to
in
scotch
whisky
but
more
like
a
clean
oak
smoke
or
something
else
a
bit
less
intense
than
decaying
biomass
its
a
really
wellbalanced
nose
in
the
mouth
there
is
bitter
chocolate
full
city
roasted
coffee
a
little
bit
of
anise
and
all
of
that
riding
on
a
clean
cloud
of
smoke
again
the
smoke
isnt
overbearing
or
especially
pungent
just
present
and
very
pleasant
the
body
is
medium
but
the
finish
is
nice
and
long
with
the
bitter
chocolate
lingering
with
the
smoke
the
only
downside
of
this
beer
is
that
its
probably
a
little
too
distinctive
to
drink
back
to
back
to
back
but
thats
hardly
a
knock
i
like
this
beer
a
good
deal
quite
a
bit
more
than
i
thought
i
would
the
smoke
is
just
another
flavor
in
a
wellconstructed
stout
rather
than
a
boltedon
gimmicky
flavor
after
a
few
misses
with
me
dark
horse
has
really
come
through
with
fore
and
plead
the
5th
way
more
balanced
in
bottle
than
on
the
draft
version
i
had
last
week
this
dark
pitch
black
michigan
stout
forms
with
a
3
finger
thicket
of
dark
khaki
tan
head
leaves
thick
chunky
sporadic
lacing
aroma
has
dark
chocolate
hints
of
fruity
coffee
and
underlying
layers
of
smoked
malts
really
not
bad
one
of
the
better
of
the
four
stouts
creamy
dark
chocolate
flavor
with
hints
of
coffee
and
smoked
stouts
flavors
in
clude
dark
dry
bitter
chocolate
with
hints
of
roasted
barley
and
smoked
underlying
malts
not
in
your
face
but
really
cohesive
and
complimentary
toward
one
another
mouthfeel
is
big
bodied
stout
with
a
creamy
bodied
and
lingering
smokey
bitterness
from
the
dark
malts
and
smoked
malt
additions
overall
impression
is
that
things
just
keep
getting
better
when
i
try
a
new
beer
from
dark
horse
i
want
to
see
more
in
ohio
and
pittsburgh
great
not
too
late
to
get
adventurous
greab
some
of
the
5
stouts
this
year
before
they
all
disappear
not
my
favorite
of
the
series
or
style
but
very
good
smoke
is
dominant
but
not
overpowering
which
is
good
i
would
not
drink
this
often
but
i
would
drink
it
again
dark
horse
makes
two
of
my
favorite
smoky
beers
by
not
letting
the
smoke
overpower
but
adding
complexity
finish
burnt
malts
with
a
subtle
bitter
hop
overall
big
character
and
strong
flavor
throughout
a
little
aging
would
help
mellow
out
this
strong
stout
i
really
like
this
beer
but
the
smoke
is
nearly
nonexistent
the
problem
seems
to
be
the
same
for
all
of
the
first
four
beers
in
the
stout
series
they
are
overly
toasty
still
a
good
overall
beer
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
smoked
name
heres
a
fine
example
of
a
solid
average
stout
there
isnt
much
smoke
in
either
the
aroma
or
the
taste
though
what
is
there
is
akin
to
the
smell
of
a
match
that
someone
lit
10
minutes
ago
a
bit
woody
a
tad
sweet
kind
of
old
too
bad
still
this
isnt
such
a
bad
beer
roast
coffee
molasses
vanilla
etc
and
a
nice
dry
finish
low
abv
and
a
nice
creamy
head
decent
but
not
a
standout
its
worth
a
fourpack
the
new
six
pack
o
multidimensional
beer
i
feel
the
strongest
of
the
series
so
far
great
beer
and
overly
drinkable
for
a
stout
of
its
kind
o
this
is
only
my
2nd
time
trying
dark
horse
just
an
ok
american
stout
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
it
is
solid
could
use
a
little
more
body
blind
man
in
the
dark
govt
mule
d
it
is
pretty
good
except
for
the
strange
but
not
unusual
aftertaste
the
meat
flavor
sounds
good
but
doesnt
actually
taste
like
jerky
or
any
other
smoked
meat
there
is
probably
a
low
abv
id
assume
somewhere
around
56
so
this
isnt
in
the
imperial
range
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
smoke
characteristic
coming
through
flavor
is
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
with
some
smokey
firepit
lingering
after
each
swallow
a
little
molasses
mixed
in
with
the
roasted
notes
pretty
nice
and
easy
drinking
beer
no
hops
or
abv
show
up
anywhere
that
i
can
detect
a
nice
smokey
stout
that
doest
taste
like
eating
burnt
matches
not
something
that
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
wow
what
a
beer
would
go
well
with
bacon
and
eggs
or
bbq
pours
out
to
a
blackishbrown
body
with
a
1tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
good
lacing
the
smell
is
some
chocolate
coffee
roasted
smoked
malts
and
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
smoked
malts
throughout
along
with
strong
bitter
chocolate
followed
by
some
coffee
molasses
and
some
sweet
dark
fruits
at
the
end
im
guessing
the
dark
fruits
is
mostly
raisins
the
aftertaste
is
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
reminds
me
of
dark
chocolate
covered
raisins
the
mouthfeel
is
a
smooth
and
creamy
feel
that
leaves
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
dryness
in
the
mouth
the
good
taste
and
smoothness
of
this
stout
makes
it
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
with
some
smoked
cheese
andor
dark
chocolate
candy
d
a
pretty
nice
stout
i
liked
the
nose
a
lot
but
would
have
liked
a
little
more
smoke
in
the
taste
would
have
again
this
beer
poured
a
midnight
black
viscous
with
a
light
dark
khaki
head
that
laced
the
glass
i
know
this
beer
is
released
in
january
but
i
think
this
may
be
from
last
year
due
to
all
of
the
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
beer
doesnt
smell
any
different
from
the
dark
horse
one
oatmeal
stout
it
has
dark
rich
roasted
malts
slight
smoke
some
oak
and
has
a
lactic
acid
like
sweetness
that
fades
to
bitterness
the
longer
you
sip
the
beer
the
more
smoke
you
get
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
better
than
the
oatmeal
in
my
opinion
it
surprising
starts
out
as
bitter
chocolate
before
finishing
with
moderate
smoke
the
more
you
drink
it
the
sweeter
the
chocolate
becomes
i
like
it
it
doesnt
have
the
lactic
acid
that
the
oatmeal
can
have
it
drinks
pretty
smoothly
and
still
has
good
carbonation
that
tingles
the
palate
this
is
probably
my
favorite
one
of
their
stouts
its
also
pretty
drinkable
considering
its
probably
around
8
like
the
oatmeal
mouthfeelmedium
to
low
carbonation
delivers
a
silky
coating
to
the
palate
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
comes
through
and
the
finish
hints
at
some
herbal
hops
almost
clean
some
char
can
be
found
with
a
froth
on
the
palate
good
dark
roated
malt
flavors
mix
in
as
well
i
was
expecting
a
more
aggressive
smoke
flavor
but
this
is
a
very
pleasing
stout
and
i
like
the
subtleness
of
the
smoke
tastes
like
a
milk
stout
with
the
char
and
the
dark
roasted
flavors
coming
and
going
bottle
poured
a
dark
black
color
stout
with
a
medium
size
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
smoked
notes
with
some
black
chocolate
and
dry
roasted
notes
taste
is
also
a
nice
enough
mix
between
some
light
smoke
notes
with
some
black
chocolate
and
a
dry
roasted
malt
finish
body
was
full
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
and
some
good
carbonation
well
brewed
stout
though
smoked
notes
are
not
as
prominent
as
i
would
have
expected
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
very
interesting
color
head
this
head
is
the
darkest
tan
i
have
ever
seen
the
aroma
smells
of
roasted
malts
but
mostly
smoke
the
taste
starts
out
strong
with
smoke
maybe
a
smoked
meat
like
flavor
switching
over
to
a
sweet
yet
bitter
roasted
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
it
is
more
of
a
sipping
beer
d
goes
down
easily
quite
tasty
not
too
filling
decent
kick
and
a
nice
representation
of
style
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
beer
although
it
seems
a
bit
light
for
a
stout
and
somewhat
lacking
in
smoke
still
solid
in
the
major
categories
this
beer
went
down
easy
despite
its
heaviness
and
is
one
that
i
definitely
want
to
try
again
dark
horse
fore
smoked
stout
pours
a
deep
chocolate
colored
head
over
an
inky
black
brew
the
nose
is
smoke
though
not
cloying
over
dark
chocolate
with
notes
of
leather
the
flavor
is
more
of
that
smoke
with
roasty
malts
and
bakers
chocolate
notes
with
a
little
bite
of
charred
bread
off
the
end
for
balance
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
round
with
a
long
mellow
finish
smoked
ales
are
pretty
tricky
that
particular
flavor
is
so
aggressive
its
easy
to
end
up
with
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
slim
jim
four
finds
that
proper
balance
the
smoke
is
a
point
of
complexity
that
does
not
dominate
d
more
of
a
plain
yet
well
performed
stout
with
a
hint
of
smoke
than
a
full
fledged
smoked
stout
still
works
very
well
on
a
rainy
and
slightly
chilly
fall
night
this
might
work
well
in
some
chili
or
stew
d
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
was
hoping
for
a
great
beer
and
i
feel
like
i
got
average
i
would
have
like
more
smoke
and
a
little
less
carbonation
im
gonna
try
laying
one
of
these
down
for
a
bit
if
for
no
other
reason
than
why
not
enjoyable
beer
nearly
every
category
was
spot
on
my
biggest
gripe
was
the
lack
of
smoke
i
think
a
slight
increase
would
really
enhance
this
beer
fore
smoked
stout
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
i
am
probably
grabbing
a
second
poured
into
a
snifter
color
is
near
black
with
a
bit
of
a
brownish
tint
in
the
light
not
much
head
or
lace
nose
brigs
some
roasted
malt
smoke
coffee
and
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
taste
is
mostly
roast
and
smoke
in
pretty
decent
balance
feel
is
nice
and
dry
with
a
good
body
a
nice
stout
but
not
my
favorite
in
the
numbered
line
dark
horse
with
another
great
stout
note
this
is
a
winter
release
so
im
assuming
this
is
an
09
maybe
the
smoke
fades
a
bit
after
some
time
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
carbonation
being
low
very
nice
mouthfeel
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
flavorful
and
bold
imperial
stout
it
wasnt
as
smoky
as
i
hoped
but
the
burnt
bitterness
was
very
nice
a
very
nice
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
a
bit
flat
the
beer
is
a
bit
surupy
and
clings
to
the
mouth
it
is
quite
drinkable
the
smoked
flavor
is
in
no
way
overbearing
good
beer
very
enjoyable
this
is
the
typical
dark
horse
offering
that
is
meant
as
a
good
thing
a
really
good
smoke
stout
with
lots
of
balance
as
always
well
done
pours
black
with
a
small
mocha
head
that
fades
fast
the
smell
is
smoky
up
front
with
plenty
of
sweet
notes
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
chocolate
malt
the
first
characteristic
i
noticed
was
the
lack
of
body
that
i
was
expecting
from
a
stout
but
the
flavor
was
good
starting
subtle
and
finishing
strong
the
malt
and
alcohol
were
apparent
in
every
sip
along
with
the
smoke
more
flavors
came
out
as
the
beer
warmed
the
mouthfeel
was
lacking
i
was
hoping
for
a
heavier
beer
but
this
medium
light
feel
was
ok
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
lots
of
flavor
and
definitely
worth
a
try
drinks
fairly
easy
not
bad
but
doesnt
quite
pull
together
probably
the
lowest
rated
beer
for
me
that
ive
had
from
these
guys
drinkable
its
good
enough
i
could
put
off
playing
with
power
tools
or
driving
around
just
kick
back
with
some
provalone
and
fresh
cherries
call
it
a
good
day
overall
a
nice
stout
with
good
flavors
i
didnt
pick
up
on
much
smoke
which
was
a
bit
of
a
bummer
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
wish
a
touch
of
hops
clean
up
the
mad
array
of
flavors
at
the
end
leaving
a
light
smoke
and
roasted
note
in
your
mouth
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
smooth
with
a
very
silky
touch
to
it
it
was
not
very
heavy
while
it
was
packed
with
flavor
i
would
say
that
it
was
a
reasonable
smoke
stout
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
just
the
internet
thanks
jon
the
smoke
aromas
are
paramount
pours
black
great
lace
above
average
mouthfeel
coffee
smoke
in
flavour
above
average
mouthfeel
good
and
drinkable
smoked
that
scored
way
about
imperial
stouts
and
porters
in
this
tasting
another
amazing
stout
from
this
brewery
d
this
stout
wasnt
bad
it
was
my
first
smoked
stout
and
i
actually
enjoyed
the
smoke
flavors
the
mouthfeel
just
threw
me
off
a
little
4
0
d
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
im
starting
to
think
that
dark
horse
makes
some
damn
fine
beer
so
far
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
dark
horses
stout
line
up
this
is
another
good
one
from
them
and
its
getting
harder
for
me
to
pick
a
dark
horse
favorite
d
tasty
stuff
and
to
too
heavy
on
the
smoke
id
like
to
try
it
paired
up
with
some
killer
smoked
meats
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
full
and
the
finish
is
full
this
beer
reallty
suprised
me
i
was
afraid
that
the
blast
of
the
hickory
smoke
was
going
to
over
take
the
palate
but
it
didnt
the
flavor
was
consisting
and
balanced
a
good
beer
nonetheless
please
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
as
i
am
fairly
certain
this
bottle
was
mislabelled
d
aroma
is
rich
and
very
smoky
with
a
chocolaty
undertone
and
hints
of
burnt
wood
and
molasses
it
pours
a
beautiful
opaque
sable
just
a
whisker
above
black
with
a
thick
finebubbled
tan
head
rich
flavor
is
very
smoky
and
has
tones
of
molasses
fine
roast
coffee
and
unsweet
chocolate
as
well
as
a
tiny
fishy
hint
texture
is
thick
smooth
oily
and
just
a
little
tingly
this
one
is
a
must
between
the
smoke
mineral
and
the
burnt
chocolate
this
has
a
kind
of
carbonized
vibe
to
it
which
is
cool
but
can
be
a
little
tiresome
that
said
its
still
an
adequately
wellrounded
and
thankfully
multidimensional
stout
smoke
is
only
a
part
of
the
equation
here
f
finishes
slightly
bitter
from
the
roasted
malts
lingering
smoked
malt
flavors
little
smoked
meats
and
cheese
again
it
has
that
generic
almost
plasticy
like
lingering
flavor
i
really
wish
that
wasnt
there
otherwise
more
brown
sugar
lingering
but
quite
dry
pours
black
with
dark
red
highlights
dark
tan
head
sticks
around
for
just
a
bit
nose
is
toasty
with
some
dark
chocolate
im
not
picking
up
much
smoke
maybe
just
a
touch
the
dark
chocolate
bitterness
comes
to
the
front
in
the
taste
id
actually
like
it
to
be
more
smoky
it
just
tastes
like
a
decent
american
stout
to
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
im
digging
the
chocolate
flavors
it
isnt
what
i
expected
but
its
a
good
beer
nonetheless
d
smoke
is
a
novelty
so
maybe
just
one
drinkability
is
very
good
surprisingly
so
the
flavor
could
use
a
bit
of
refining
but
regardless
of
that
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
the
style
black
as
oil
no
hues
coming
through
when
held
to
light
tiny
brown
head
doesnt
stay
long
scent
is
all
chocolate
malts
with
a
touch
of
campfire
same
for
the
taste
smoke
is
there
but
its
blended
in
not
as
obvious
as
some
of
the
other
smokes
ive
had
fairly
full
mouth
wet
not
a
bad
stout
much
more
smoke
in
the
flavor
with
a
hint
of
bandaids
and
charred
bacon
the
smokiness
sort
of
clashes
with
dry
dark
chocolate
nibs
and
overripened
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
dry
and
has
too
much
carbonation
for
the
style
drinks
much
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
as
fore
lacks
that
muchneeded
creaminess
and
full
body
all
in
all
an
interesting
beer
but
this
is
oneanddone
for
me
worth
trying
but
id
rather
have
a
true
stout
andor
a
rauchbier
poured
from
a
12oz
brown
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
appears
black
in
color
with
less
than
a
finger
of
severely
dark
tanned
head
that
dissolves
quite
fast
the
surface
of
this
beer
boils
with
the
brown
bubbles
of
carb
that
rise
from
the
circular
cut
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
which
agitates
and
leaves
a
ring
of
brown
lace
all
around
the
interior
perimeter
of
the
glass
aroma
of
this
beer
is
dark
and
roasty
with
scents
of
burnt
grain
akin
to
chocolate
coffee
and
a
bit
of
smoke
are
all
included
taste
is
darkly
roasted
grain
with
flavors
of
dry
bitter
chocolates
coffee
and
smoked
malt
pulls
up
the
tail
end
of
the
flavor
that
lingers
through
the
semidry
bitter
finish
medium
feel
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
for
being
the
smoked
version
of
their
stout
it
is
equally
roasty
and
smokey
as
the
other
offerings
ive
had
from
them
and
just
barley
enough
of
the
smoked
character
to
accent
it
and
set
it
off
as
being
different
from
the
rest
there
is
a
slight
lingering
musty
flavor
left
in
the
mouth
along
with
the
smoke
flavor
that
is
a
bit
offputting
other
than
that
overall
it
was
decent
overall
i
like
this
beer
simply
because
i
love
smoked
anything
we
smoke
our
own
meats
so
naturally
this
brew
would
be
an
ideal
suitor
that
said
its
not
for
the
squeamish
out
of
the
4
so
far
its
definitely
the
most
inyourface
brew
this
one
stands
out
more
than
the
others
simply
because
it
was
a
bit
more
unbalanced
in
flavor
whereas
the
oatmeal
the
cream
and
the
blueberry
were
all
more
subtly
involved
if
you
like
smoke
youll
love
this
brew
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
completely
opaque
a
very
dark
dark
coffee
brown
with
a
thin
chocolate
brown
head
that
clung
a
bit
aroma
was
slightly
smokey
with
a
undertone
of
dark
chocolate
taste
was
smokey
slighty
bitter
that
shifted
to
mellowness
as
it
went
on
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
very
well
perhaps
a
little
undercarbonated
not
bad
to
drink
more
of
a
sippinglingering
beer
creamy
savory
fullbodied
feel
it
feels
like
a
much
more
substantive
beer
than
i
suspect
it
is
i
barely
feel
anything
after
having
finished
the
glass
so
i
suspect
this
is
45
similar
to
the
tres
blueberry
stout
this
one
also
hits
the
mark
for
me
i
wish
more
breweries
were
making
lowabv
beers
with
this
much
bigbeer
flavor
no
fluke
here
dark
horse
is
making
some
nice
beers
body
is
a
bit
lighter
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
a
nice
beer
the
smoky
component
adds
a
nice
twist
pours
almost
jet
black
with
a
modest
tan
head
very
little
head
retention
attractive
nose
of
vanilla
and
toffee
these
flavors
are
present
in
the
taste
along
with
caramel
notes
very
nice
malt
profile
smoke
flavor
is
subtle
which
is
why
this
is
the
first
smoked
beer
ive
liked
this
one
went
down
quickly
d
to
me
this
is
a
very
drinakable
smoked
stout
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
wish
i
had
access
to
it
d
this
is
closer
to
a
sessionable
stout
goes
down
easy
if
you
like
charred
roasted
and
smokey
flavors
this
was
good
and
might
have
been
my
overall
favorite
of
the
four
stouts
just
enough
smoke
was
present
while
still
letting
the
rest
of
the
flavors
have
there
time
as
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
im
not
sure
of
the
abv
on
this
but
im
thinking
its
in
the
78
range
either
way
you
cant
taste
it
out
of
all
the
smoked
beers
ive
had
this
is
one
that
i
can
have
two
of
in
a
night
when
it
was
vwery
cold
i
did
not
enjoy
the
taste
but
with
time
this
one
is
a
monster
another
winner
from
dark
horse
they
do
good
work
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
in
this
series
its
very
drinkable
and
the
smoke
is
nicely
integrated
and
does
not
overwhelm
d
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
would
like
this
one
especially
after
the
smoked
bacon
scent
on
the
nose
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
beer
ovearall
probably
not
something
ill
buy
but
it
was
good
to
try
its
a
fairly
good
drink
just
not
a
beer
that
pulls
me
back
and
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
drinkability
this
is
a
very
pleasant
stout
its
easy
to
drink
and
the
abv
doesnt
feel
very
high
so
that
2
or
3
wouldnt
be
a
problem
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
smoke
in
the
taste
but
there
is
some
there
and
no
reason
to
knock
it
for
there
not
being
more
of
it
d
another
very
drinkable
beer
from
dark
horse
i
enjoy
this
one
a
lot
because
it
is
something
that
is
not
done
much
at
all
cheers
to
aaron
for
choosing
this
beer
as
something
to
not
only
make
but
bottle
as
well
all
in
all
a
solid
brew
very
tasty
and
complex
im
a
big
dark
horse
fan
never
had
a
bad
brew
it
is
very
cool
to
see
dark
horse
make
its
presence
known
in
mass
smoked
stout
how
many
of
those
do
you
see
around
comes
out
a
completely
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
large
tan
head
dark
roasted
malt
in
the
smell
combined
with
some
dark
chocolate
earth
and
just
a
little
bit
of
the
smoke
factor
the
dark
chocolate
shines
through
in
the
taste
with
some
earth
tones
and
the
smoke
in
the
background
keeping
things
interesting
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
which
was
the
last
thing
i
was
expecting
from
a
smoked
stout
it
has
the
silky
texture
of
a
cask
ale
but
with
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
difficult
to
nail
down
the
abv
on
this
one
although
it
does
not
taste
boozy
at
all
i
like
the
fact
that
the
smoke
is
not
overwhelming
on
this
one
it
makes
it
that
much
more
drinkable
and
approachable
another
fine
addition
to
the
lineup
from
this
brewery
cannot
wait
to
get
some
of
there
one
off
beers
here
soon
cheers
great
choice
to
accompany
smoked
fish
with
some
strong
cheese
and
crusty
bread
great
drinkability
one
of
the
better
smoked
beers
that
i
have
encountered
d
a
moderate
stout
not
too
heavy
but
not
too
light
the
chocolate
and
cocoa
mix
works
for
me
d
interesting
beer
intense
smoke
throughout
the
experience
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
might
have
to
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
when
im
in
the
mood
the
smoke
is
very
present
in
the
taste
still
leaning
toward
being
reminiscient
of
barbecue
smoke
actually
it
reminds
me
most
of
liquid
smoke
an
artificial
smoke
flavoring
used
for
cooking
also
some
coffee
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
drinkability
is
ok
for
one
or
two
but
i
find
myself
not
really
knowing
what
to
do
with
the
rest
of
the
4
pack
in
time
im
sure
they
will
get
drank
one
way
or
another
drinkability
a
better
than
average
but
not
great
smoked
beer
i
could
have
a
couple
but
have
no
desire
to
finish
a
four
pack
decent
and
worth
a
try
having
gone
all
the
way
through
my
bottle
i
still
believe
this
has
a
similar
base
to
tres
its
a
very
solid
american
stout
backbone
but
with
such
a
strong
affinity
towards
dark
chocolate
i
feel
blueberry
mingles
with
it
much
better
than
smoke
the
end
result
is
me
wishing
i
had
a
bottle
of
tres
hanging
around
all
in
all
there
is
not
much
special
going
on
in
this
brew
a
little
too
much
of
a
smoky
bacon
flavor
otherwise
its
an
ok
brew
not
worth
hunting
down
or
trying
if
you
want
to
try
something
new
then
maybe
otherwise
not
worth
your
time
decent
little
stout
despite
the
absense
of
the
smoke
a
very
drinkable
beer
quite
tasty
and
one
that
i
am
glad
that
i
got
while
it
wont
be
your
typical
example
well
worth
it
to
try
it
out
if
you
get
the
chance
d
interesting
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
this
one
is
a
winner
overall
this
beer
is
extremely
smokey
almost
too
much
smoke
decent
stout
but
the
smoke
really
covers
up
a
lot
of
the
flavors
though
not
something
i
want
a
lot
o
this
one
is
very
drinkable
for
me
this
is
what
id
call
an
almost
perfect
hybrid
of
a
rauchbier
and
stout
cant
i
would
have
this
style
of
beer
everyday
but
would
definitely
have
it
again
the
smokiness
adds
something
you
dont
get
with
many
other
beers
solid
not
bad
at
all
but
not
real
remarkable
either
easily
quaffable
the
distinguishing
part
is
subtle
not
sure
id
know
to
look
for
it
if
it
wasnt
advertised
in
the
name
dgreat
body
but
too
smoky
to
enjoy
a
ton
of
them
the
flavors
are
big
which
i
enjoy
but
it
seems
overly
smokey
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
chocolate
colored
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
not
great
on
the
retention
either
when
its
cold
this
one
smells
like
a
wet
dog
which
is
not
appealing
as
it
warms
however
more
roasted
notes
come
out
with
some
nice
smooth
smokiness
taste
is
pretty
good
the
smoke
isnt
overpowering
at
all
tastes
kind
of
like
stone
smoked
porter
to
me
maybe
a
bit
smokier
mf
is
a
bit
thin
though
a
pretty
good
stout
overall
drinks
well
i
was
happy
i
had
it
though
im
not
sure
ill
be
revisiting
it
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
one
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
lot
more
smoky
maybe
this
is
because
im
a
big
fan
of
smoky
peaty
islay
whiskies
like
laphroaig
ardbeg
and
lagavulin
curious
about
the
abv
does
anyone
know
d
another
winner
from
dark
horse
i
really
like
what
they
do
with
their
stouts
and
this
one
is
no
exception
a
very
enjoyable
beer
dark
horse
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
as
of
late
almost
every
beer
i
have
had
from
them
has
been
extremely
impressive
this
isnt
my
favorite
stout
i
have
had
from
them
but
it
is
definetly
unique
and
well
worth
a
shot
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
brown
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
aroma
is
smoked
and
roasted
malt
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
wood
and
some
dark
fruit
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
there
is
also
some
licorice
noticable
in
the
taste
along
with
a
nice
lingering
smoky
and
sweet
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
it
is
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
its
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
as
the
alcohol
isnt
noticable
at
all
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
good
thing
i
bought
a
4
pack
of
this
a
solid
american
stout
that
is
quite
flavorful
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
much
bolder
imperial
stouts
a
little
watery
going
down
but
nothing
to
really
complain
about
the
fact
of
that
is
it
makes
the
beer
easier
to
drink
mix
that
in
with
the
delicious
and
complex
taste
and
you
have
a
spectacular
stout
that
you
should
try
soon
a
nice
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
i
think
this
because
my
glass
was
slightly
dirty
the
beer
is
pitch
black
and
poured
like
motor
oil
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
filled
with
roasted
malts
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
smoked
malt
the
flavour
is
around
is
flavourful
but
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
which
hurts
this
beer
a
lot
the
flavours
are
smoked
notes
and
a
lot
of
coffee
flavours
some
hints
of
chocolate
come
through
as
well
there
isnt
just
enough
flavour
a
good
american
stout
from
one
of
michigans
better
brewers
d
i
am
guessing
the
abv
at
most
is
7
so
certainly
capable
of
throwing
a
few
of
these
back
and
the
price
point
isnt
anything
to
cover
the
eyes
about
a
easy
drinking
smoked
beer
solid
black
brown
thick
and
ominous
looking
with
a
reasonable
chocolate
brown
head
and
goodly
lacing
the
aroma
is
major
league
dark
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
sizzling
bacon
amazing
sweet
but
just
a
slight
salty
edge
the
flavor
jumps
out
with
a
full
chocate
malt
and
a
subtle
coffee
bitterness
theres
a
hint
of
sweet
smoke
but
the
coffee
prevails
most
in
a
relatively
drinkable
midplus
bodied
brew
the
carbonation
is
subtle
and
smooth
quite
an
impressive
stout
gina
at
dark
horse
suggested
after
i
asked
that
they
had
just
changed
the
tap
lines
and
even
though
they
were
rinsed
cleaned
that
some
of
the
previous
raspberry
ale
might
still
be
present
on
the
line
you
know
what
this
did
not
hurt
the
taste
of
this
beer
at
all
i
woudl
drink
plenty
of
these
in
the
fall
perfect
fall
beer
i
poured
what
looked
like
motor
oil
into
my
beer
tasting
wine
glass
the
little
bit
of
light
brown
head
disappeared
quickly
this
beer
is
black
as
night
the
smell
is
mostly
burnt
coffee
with
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
smoke
makes
itself
evident
in
the
taste
im
tasting
everything
in
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
smoked
sausage
and
some
raisin
nice
silky
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
another
solid
offering
from
a
brewery
that
continues
to
put
out
a
lot
of
winners
note
to
dark
horse
you
keep
putting
out
7
99
4
packs
of
great
beer
ill
keep
buying
them
nice
example
of
a
sweet
dry
stout
the
smoke
flavor
wasnt
a
very
big
part
of
the
beer
but
it
is
there
nice
black
beer
with
a
dark
brown
head

finger
to
the
head
and
the
appearance
of
this
beer
after
poured
reminded
me
of
a
breakfast
stout
nice
cascading
effect
as
the
snifter
is
tilted
roasted
malt
with
burnt
brown
sugar
and
semisweet
chocolate
slightly
smoky
as
it
comes
in
and
slightly
sweet
as
it
goes
down
mouthfeel
a
little
on
the
silky
thin
side
good
but
not
great
d
ive
been
holding
off
on
this
one
because
i
rarely
if
ever
like
smoked
beers
but
fore
was
a
revelation
mild
complimentary
smoke
flavored
played
nicely
with
the
more
traditional
stout
flavors
resulting
in
a
very
nice
stout
wellrecommended
probably
my
favorite
of
their
seasonal
stout
series
drinkability
is
good
here
if
you
can
find
this
gem
the
fourth
installment
pours
with
the
same
incredible
darkness
as
the
other
three
and
has
about
as
much
of
a
head
as
the
first
maybe
only
a
bit
more
but
you
wouldnt
know
the
difference
after
about
10
seconds
the
darkness
is
lovely
but
it
looks
lifeless
almost
the
smell
is
good
burnt
crusty
bread
hardwood
ashe
dark
astringent
coffee
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
all
come
to
mind
it
smells
like
a
stout
cooked
over
an
open
wood
flame
then
allowed
to
cool
down
but
not
quite
as
intense
on
the
smoky
note
as
i
woul
expect
based
on
one
too
and
tres
in
regards
to
their
flavors
i
think
the
smokiness
here
does
a
nice
job
enhancing
the
dark
roastiness
in
all
ways
and
the
very
same
goes
for
the
taste
you
come
up
with
a
heavy
roast
coffe
with
bread
dunked
into
it
and
a
tiny
bit
of
the
darkest
burntest
crusty
bits
of
a
slab
of
heavily
smoked
meat
then
it
kind
of
levels
out
with
a
nice
chocolatey
sweetness
and
finishes
really
quite
clean
i
expected
the
undercooked
weenie
taste
that
is
usual
in
other
smoked
beers
but
if
its
here
its
a
well
overcooked
almost
black
weenie
with
some
ashe
on
it
im
really
liking
this
smoked
stout
though
it
may
be
hard
to
tell
it
apart
from
some
other
equally
as
good
unsmoked
stouts
i
could
be
wrong
though
i
do
start
to
get
a
lingering
smoky
taste
as
i
continue
drinking
the
body
is
kind
of
medium
not
as
full
as
the
others
nice
though
but
the
carbonation
comes
on
sharply
stinging
a
bit
as
i
swallow
overall
though
this
is
a
great
one
i
mean
of
the
four
and
for
that
matter
about
any
american
stout
this
one
has
the
best
everyday
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
reaching
for
quite
a
few
of
these
until
the
burnt
wood
caught
up
with
me
thats
thwe
only
real
hindrance
but
if
you
like
it
if
it
brings
back
memories
of
making
bbq
over
a
live
fire
then
youll
love
it
near
black
opaque
color
with
a
large
quickly
diminishing
mocha
head
that
leaves
a
thin
ring
with
little
lacing
aroma
isnt
very
smokey
more
roasted
malt
barley
chocolate
flavor
follows
the
nose
and
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
mild
cousin
to
founders
breakfast
burnt
malt
and
coffee
milk
chocolate
barley
and
the
smokiness
lingers
in
the
finish
but
never
really
asserts
itself
in
the
body
slightly
thinner
body
than
expected
for
the
style
but
strong
carbonation
burnt
flavors
and
mild
hopiness
compensate
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
smoke
but
an
excellent
stout
and
will
seek
this
out
again
d
i
love
the
taste
but
this
ones
a
sipper
for
me
no
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
smoked
brew
not
overpowering
but
good
enough
smoked
flavor
resample
drinkability
another
interesting
dark
horse
brew
and
a
worthy
addition
to
the
what
the
hecks
the
name
of
this
series
anyway
the
one
through
five
series
whatever
similarly
low
in
alcohol
enhancing
the
drinkability
somewhat
but
also
a
little
less
flavorful
a
little
too
carbonated
and
a
little
duller
looking
than
id
like
decreasing
it
somewhat
all
in
all
though
its
a
good
beer
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
though
not
one
i
could
really
see
myself
enjoying
on
a
regular
basis
ha
i
love
this
fizzy
root
beer
head
that
appears
and
extinguishes
just
as
quickly
i
am
reminded
oh
so
slightly
of
smokey
campfires
and
spicy
roasty
chocolates
i
have
had
this
one
time
prior
on
draft
at
the
bavarian
lodge
in
il
and
i
cant
say
that
bottling
has
reduced
the
draw
of
this
stout
it
is
dark
real
dark
yet
one
can
still
recognize
the
chocolate
aspects
of
the
hue
this
will
definitely
be
a
stout
i
shall
keep
an
eye
peeled
for
when
on
more
midwest
soils
bottle
pours
black
with
hardly
any
head
aroma
of
sweet
rich
roasted
malt
booze
and
a
touch
of
smoke
flavor
is
sweet
initially
with
some
light
smoky
flavors
but
not
smoked
meats
weakish
palate
ok
but
i
like
the
other
dark
horse
stouts
better
pours
a
dark
black
color
13
inch
head
of
a
dark
tan
color
decent
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
slight
alcohol
slight
sweet
malt
some
breadiness
and
hints
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
american
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
bitterness
of
the
malt
is
quite
noticeable
tastes
of
roasted
malt
up
front
and
throughout
some
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
not
so
much
smokey
as
strongly
roasted
and
hop
is
present
in
the
background
it
takes
a
while
for
the
slight
smoke
flavor
to
come
through
needed
to
warm
up
a
bit
very
rich
in
flavor
and
roasted
bitterness
is
strong
in
the
finish
everything
is
pretty
good
about
this
beer
except
the
appearance
very
little
retention
and
lacing
sure
its
drinkable
sure
id
take
it
over
a
waterey
guinness
id
also
reach
for
something
else
before
this
one
though
like
the
dark
horse
tres
blueberry
stout
drinkability
pretty
smooth
drinkability
but
nothing
i
would
go
crazy
over
right
now
good
but
not
great
d
very
drinkable
flavors
are
amiable
to
the
palate
and
alcoholic
taste
is
not
present
not
too
heavy
and
easy
to
finish
too
quickly
d
i
really
like
what
dark
horse
is
doing
the
stouts
i
have
had
from
them
were
amazing
the
only
one
i
have
left
to
hunt
down
is
the
blueberry
otherwise
great
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
for
a
stout
worth
a
try
but
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
id
rather
have
a
ris
or
a
cream
stout
but
the
smoke
is
a
nice
change
from
the
oatmeal
stout
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
dark
brown
head
over
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
head
is
promptly
down
to
a
swirly
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
with
heavy
legs
and
fleeting
lace
aroma
is
sweet
coffee
taste
follows
the
nose
hearty
coffee
throughout
with
wisps
of
smoke
if
at
all
just
not
much
room
left
after
the
coffee
gets
done
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
smooth
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
a
good
brew
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
enjoyable
and
interesting
stout
smoke
character
is
mild
but
very
complementary
another
great
stout
from
dark
horse
my
favorite
of
the
stout
series
for
dark
horse
and
would
suggest
seeking
this
one
out
pour
is
quite
viscus
not
much
head
looks
like
a
stout
generally
should
smell
is
chocolate
caramel
molasses
and
a
gentle
smoke
tastes
is
pretty
much
that
not
a
very
aggressive
smoked
malt
character
somewhat
oatmeal
stout
sweet
quite
sweet
actually
excellent
volume
not
heavy
but
quite
creamy
smooth
not
boozy
at
all
overall
admittedly
im
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
and
obviously
if
you
dont
like
smoked
beers
dont
drink
thisduh
but
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
one
the
harsher
roast
notes
likely
from
black
patent
malt
make
this
a
nice
variation
on
the
ubiquitous
smoked
porter
and
all
of
the
flavors
seem
to
meld
together
nicely
if
you
like
smoked
beers
definitely
seek
this
one
out
12
oz
pours
black
with
an
ok
brown
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
not
much
for
lacing
either
aromas
are
definitely
smoke
reminiscent
of
a
campfire
along
with
roasted
malts
and
a
faint
hint
of
mocha
flavors
are
very
roasty
nearing
a
burned
malt
overtone
with
the
smoke
evident
but
not
over
the
top
also
hints
of
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
are
present
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
coats
the
palate
well
the
roastiness
provides
good
balance
to
the
ale
i
think
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
the
oatmeal
the
most
out
of
the
series
only
problem
is
i
havent
seen
plead
the
5th
anywhere
and
its
probably
not
available
anymore
all
4
were
very
good
takes
on
stouts
and
was
fun
to
go
through
d
easy
to
finish
but
i
dont
think
id
reach
for
another
one
right
away
smoked
beers
are
more
of
a
novelty
to
me
the
smokiness
is
about
the
perfect
level
dark
horse
made
this
one
well
check
it
out
d
this
is
very
enjoyable
im
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
thanks
bill
overall
a
solid
brew
and
my
first
smoked
stout
dark
horse
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
dthis
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
great
leaving
me
wanting
more
d
quite
enjoyable
a
well
made
stout
with
or
without
the
smoke
bold
flavors
come
together
nicely
good
sipper
as
it
seems
a
little
strong
for
a
session
beer
would
be
happy
to
have
more
fore
is
another
excellent
beer
in
dark
horses
stout
series
its
not
perfect
the
nose
could
use
some
muscle
and
more
body
would
go
a
long
way
but
it
does
have
a
lot
of
flavor
to
go
around
ive
heard
rumors
that
dark
horse
will
be
distributing
in
ohio
soon
i
dont
know
how
true
that
is
but
a
guy
can
dream
cant
he
m
full
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
rate
ridiculously
smooth
drinkable
times
fore
a
great
stout
by
dark
horse
i
knew
i
wanted
to
try
this
beer
but
knew
nothing
about
it
i
was
blown
away
nice
job
dark
horse
pours
a
pitch
black
and
very
little
head
smoked
hops
and
malt
come
to
mind
first
on
the
smell
oily
surface
with
beads
settling
on
the
surface
for
a
few
seconds
lacy
with
an
espresso
brown
color
on
first
taste
espresso
comes
to
mind
in
a
big
way
with
maybe
a
finish
of
chocolate
not
too
overpowering
but
a
bit
sweet
at
the
end
after
taste
stays
in
your
mouth
for
a
bit
a
decent
brew
and
certainly
worth
trying
a
very
tasty
ris
but
no
smoke
to
be
found
at
all
this
one
paired
like
a
champion
with
the
cherrychocolate
dairy
queen
ice
cream
cake
i
got
for
the
wife
this
valentines
day
d
really
enjoyable
to
drink
and
something
a
little
different
for
sure
while
its
a
very
good
beer
each
sip
didnt
leave
me
longing
for
the
next
so
drinkability
comes
in
a
bit
low
pours
a
black
oil
consistency
with
little
head
that
dwindled
down
to
a
ring
smell
is
a
little
boozy
almost
like
boubon
there
is
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
but
mostly
alcohol
the
taste
is
more
to
the
style
there
is
a
hint
of
smoke
with
a
really
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
but
its
more
of
sipper
than
a
session
a
solid
offering
from
dark
horse
but
not
the
best
smoked
beer
complex
standout
beer
d
i
hear
these
stout
series
beers
are
best
fresh
the
nose
and
flavor
are
lacking
on
this
year
old
still
drinkable
but
tastes
sludgy
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
dark
in
appearance
with
a
thin
dirty
colored
head
that
dissipated
quickly
aroma
consisted
of
mostly
ethanol
with
some
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavor
was
not
very
smoky
almost
like
that
liquid
smoke
flavoring
highly
ethanolic
with
roasted
overtones
taste
more
sweet
chocolate
malts
im
surprised
that
the
chocolate
flavor
of
the
malts
is
coming
across
so
strong
i
figured
that
the
smoke
would
dominate
more
the
smoke
is
strongest
on
the
aftertaste
near
black
pour
with
a
brownish
head
roast
malt
and
coffee
aromas
earthy
some
smoke
full
bodied
just
a
bit
of
liveliness
in
the
mouth
flavor
similar
to
nose
but
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
toffee
or
nut
smoke
is
present
but
very
unterstated
finishes
clean
not
real
lingering
would
expect
this
to
stay
with
you
a
bit
longer
another
in
the
line
of
excellent
dark
beers
from
dark
horse
my
least
favorite
of
the
number
beers
thus
far
however
i
ordered
dark
horse
one
and
two
from
archer
and
look
forward
to
trying
them
out
soon
just
finished
the
dark
horse
brewery
fore
smoked
stout
i
think
i
marginally
prefer
it
to
the
oatmeal
stout
i
tried
yesterday
it
had
a
bit
more
head
although
head
retention
was
still
a
problem
the
same
pitch
black
color
and
the
same
mild
drinkability
however
the
smokiness
definitely
adds
some
needed
complexity
and
without
overpowering
roasted
malt
dryness
which
is
up
front
both
of
these
ales
however
are
on
the
mild
thin
side
of
the
stout
spectrum
drinkability
is
good
in
general
this
is
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
however
considering
the
size
itd
make
a
great
alternative
to
say
a
bomber
of
alaskan
smoked
or
stone
smoked
this
went
great
with
home
made
pulled
pork
d
its
a
really
smoky
beer
theres
no
hiding
that
i
like
smoke
but
i
dont
know
i
could
drink
this
all
nite
but
its
real
good
for
1
or
2
or
maybe
3
or
more
i
bought
a
4pack
at
holiday
market
3
weeks
ago
and
now
finished
all
but
1
this
is
another
good
beer
from
a
brewery
im
starting
to
really
appreciate
the
beer
is
dark
brown
to
the
point
of
black
with
a
thick
tan
foam
that
looks
reddish
when
poured
the
smell
is
all
roasted
malts
very
very
rich
i
didnt
really
get
much
rauchbier
aroma
but
the
smoke
might
be
subtle
versus
the
onslaught
of
malt
same
in
the
taste
no
real
smoke
that
i
could
taste
but
lots
of
malty
sweetness
the
body
is
reasonably
thick
while
the
carbonation
is
a
little
light
very
good
stout
which
might
actually
be
a
double
stout
d
abv
doesnt
seem
too
high
but
this
is
still
somewhat
a
sipper
decent
though
overall
its
pretty
good
but
not
good
enough
to
make
me
really
glad
i
got
two
bottles
of
it
instead
of
buying
something
else
that
i
hadnt
had
before
i
was
a
little
overwhelmed
by
the
variety
and
grabbed
it
twice
apparently
d
a
good
sessionable
stout
i
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
nose
im
a
big
fan
of
smellin
my
beers
this
tastes
good
and
the
mouth
feel
elevates
it
to
a
higher
tier
of
good
beer
drinkability
the
whole
series
comes
up
short
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
otherwise
they
are
a
fine
group
of
beers
another
cheers
to
brdc
pours
just
a
hair
shy
of
black
with
a
surprisingly
dark
brown
head
smells
sweet
and
roasted
a
bit
peaty
tastes
a
bit
too
charred
consists
mostly
of
roasty
tones
weak
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
finishes
with
that
peat
smoked
character
a
touch
too
astringent
no
clue
what
the
abv
is
but
seems
a
little
hot
good
dry
stout
base
and
i
actually
like
the
harsh
finish
in
small
doses
though
over
the
course
of
a
bottle
it
gets
a
bit
rough
mouthfeel
isnt
terribly
viscous
but
coats
nicely
though
that
keeps
the
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
for
a
long
time
having
tried
one
through
fore
im
just
not
sure
im
so
into
dark
horses
stouts
though
i
love
their
black

swirled
around

just
escaping

i
expected
it
to
begin
foaming
champagnelike
which
it
did
but
not
immediately
as
i
had
expected
catching
me
offguard
the
foam
was
wonderfully
effervescent
somewhere
between
brown
and
tan
and
created
a
huge
head
with
a
frothy
top
happily
the
foam
died
down
before
i
became

to
drink
the
beer
a

smell
wafted
up
in

fairly
full
manner
though
not
quite
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
the
butterscotch
and
mostly
chocolate
taste
was
definitely
pleasant
too
but
also
a
little
bit
less
than
i
had
hoped
for
however
the
mixedin
smoky
flavor
was
fantastic
i
have
had
only
a
few
smoky
beers
and
in
all
the
smoke
taste
seemed
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
taste
and
kind
of
industrial
or
cigarettey
this
smoke
was
clean
like
that
of
a
hardwood
fire
and
subdued
but
not
faint
like
what
would
emanate
from
a
hearty
fire
in
the
hearth
of
a
well
ventilated
chimney
a
slight
flavor
of
the
fires
wood
was
mixed
in
with
the
smoke
along
the
way
there
were
periodic
faint
hints
of
subdued
lambic
fruitiness
perhaps
from
the
juniper
berries
though
not
discernibly
juniperlike
too
bad
the
field
was
a
bit
or
watery
than
i
had
expected
based
on
the
richness
of
the
head
also
though
the
beer
poured
a
kind
of
orangeybrown
with
lots
of
bubbles
the
effervescence
wasnt
really
discernible
i
suppose
the
bubbles
were
just
too
small
so
it
made
a
neat
appearance
but
didnt
add
to
the
experience
in
the
mouth
overall
this
was
a
more
than
pleasant
beer

just
the
merest
suggestion

smoke
towards
the
back
taste
expresses
smoked

but
it
doesnt
come
across
as
being
overly
meaty
theres
also
an
acidic
presence
must
be
the
juniper

as
well
as
a
slight
medicinal
character
towards
the
finish

an

i
find
myself
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this

not

the

in
this
beer
is
keeping
me
excited
for
each
sip
its
a
taste
i
havent
found
anywhere
else
and
beneath
all
that
it
shows
nice
play
between
bright
herbs
and
bitter
smoke
just
goes
to
show
the
skill
at
which
haandbryggeriet
operates
every
beer
ive
had
from
them
has
been
complex
and
satisfying
despite
being
sampled
about
19
months
after
the
best
bef
date
this
beer
brought
out
a
nice
combo
of
smoke
flavor
with
a
gentle
malt
sweetness
i
didnt
catch
any
of
the
juniper
berry
component
of
this
beer
this
beer
would
be
a
perfect
introduction
to
someone
who
is
curious
about
smoked
beers
but
my
be
a
bit
leery
about
being
overwhelmed
with
some
of
this
styles
bolder
examples
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
such
a
relatively
light
body
still
packed
such
a
wonderful
flavor
not
too
big
not
too
little
a
fine
beer
overall
this
ale
reminded
me
of
yazoos
sue
smoked
porter
as
well
as
the
german
rauchbiers
a
slow
sipper
due
to
the
intense
taste
but
a
wellconstructed
beer
im
glad
to
have
tried
oafter
the
overwhelming
smoke
subsided
i
noticed
some
more
fruit
flavors
and
i
started
to
enjoy
it
my
palate
was
probably
blown
out
by
the
end

i

in

despite

id
really
enjoyed
it
very
much
pretty
unique
beer
here
i
found
it
more
similar
to
a
style
akin
to
a
sahti
than
a
smoked
beer
this
may
be
attributed
to
its
age
but
like
i
said
earlier
still
enjoyable
this
one
has
been
elusive
to
me
other
then
at
a
beer
fest

i
wasnt
taking

was

able

probably
from
the

the
finish
is

medium

well
done
not
quite
as

as
some
of
my
favorite
smoked
beers
but
i
like
the
flavor
progression
and
taste
of
this
the
peat
in
the
finish
is
a
little
bit
of
an
off
flavor
for
me
but
overall
this
all
works
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
head
settles
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
on
the
glass
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
smoked
for
sure
plenty
of
burnt
smokey
aromas
in
this
one
the
malts
are
in
there
too
which
is
nice
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
the
beer
didnt
taste
salty
like
most
smoked
beers
seem
too
to
me
the
juniper
was
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
get
from
the
taste
here
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
overall
not
a
bad
smoked
beer

very

all
up
i

the

character
blending

well
with
the

really
works
the

into
the

give
a

this
would

been
done
in

an

brew
but
not
good
enough
for
me
to
go
back
at
the
10
dollar
price
tag
this
fetches
around
here
overall
a
really
nice
beer
with
a
good
story
of
the
history
behind
the
style
o
despite
this
beer
being
consumed
nearly
two
years
after
the
brewers
recommendations
it
held
up
fairly
well
im
interested
in
updating
this
review
with
notes
from
a
fresh
bottle
o
gentle
rauch
very
good
quite
enjoyable
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
light
amber
pour
with
a
medium
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
smoke
wood
the
obvious
flavor
is
smoke
hints
of
oak
salt
finishes
smokey
the
body
is
medium
good
carbonation
a
solid
smoked
beer
could
not
taste
any
juniper
never
a
good
thing
not
to
be
able
to
taste
a
listed
ingredient
overall
nice
tasting
beer
the
smoke
isnt
overdone
and
the
juniper
berries
are
a
nice
addition
good
stuff
edit
after
reading
the
description
i
think
the
odd
aroma
i
couldnt
hit
was
juniper
speaking
of
smoked
meats
that
is
exactly
the
flavor
that
my
palate
pulls
from
this
beer
like
the
best
carbonated
beef
jerkey
you
ever
tasted
i
absolutely
love
it
the
hickory
smoke
flavor
is
evident
immediately
and
lingers
in
the
mouth
the
berries
give
both
a
sweetness
that
comes
in
the
middle
and
a
very
subtle
tartness
on
the
backend
that
is
balanced
throughout
by
the
smoke
light
bodied
not
heavy
at
all
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
taste
lingers
just
long
enough
to
not
be
offensive
very
nice
beer
again
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
smoked
beer
dropping
the
strained
literary
comparison
in
short
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
and
found
it
to
be
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
smoke
really
works
with
the
oxidation
and
theres
enough
malty
goodness
in
here
from
the
munich
and
crystal
malt
to
deliver
a
very
satisfying
overall
flavor
a
nice
surprise
o
fantastic
i
love
smoke
beers
and
this
is
already
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
not
over
the
top
good
balance
good
beer
the
smoke
gets
you
first
but
once
the
beer
opens
up
the
other
flavours
meld
together
with
the
smoke
to
create
a
very
nice
smoked
ale
porter
like
notes
on
the
finish
and
the
beer
tastes
quite
like
stones
smoked
porter
at
times
the
juniper
berries
are
only
a
sideline
to
the
main
smoky
profile
but
the
beer
has
a
pleasant
balance
that
shows
up
after
awhile
i
have
enjoyed
everything
from
this
brewer
and
this
is
no
exception
pours
a
rather
ugly
cloudy
dark
orangebrown
an
attractive
tan
head
tops
the
brew
plenty
of
wood
in
the
nose
with
cherries
apples
and
smoke
supporting
first
sip
is
all
smoke
wood
sweet
malts
and
ripe
fruits
that
actually
are
juniper
berries
great
balance
as
this
puppy
is
not
overly
smoked
a
pretty
unique
beer
from
a
great
brewer
i
wish
norways
politics
were
as
good
as
her
beer
o
interesting
in
that
it
has
the
tart
fruity
characteristics
of
a
belgian
andor
juniper
berry
flavoured
pale
ale
but
with
a
mild
yet
rich
smoke
to
it
the
juxtaposition
generally
works
but
not
a
brew
where
im
looking
to
crack
a
second
well
worth
a
try
though
for
the
uniqueness
alone
o
ive
never
had
much
luck
with
norwegian
beers
or
smoked
beers
so
i
had
doubts
but
this
was
pretty
good
d
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
it
doesnt
in
my
opinion
transcend
the
best
smoked
beers
and
the
best
dark
fruity
beers
to
become
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
but
its
a
valiant
effort
worth
a
try
and
a
beer
that
i
certainly
would
not
object
against
drinking
again
o
i
was
a
little
unsure
about
how
id
perceive
this
brew
at
first
but
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
really
am
enjoying
it
its
unique
has
some
balancing
spicemaltsmokiness
that
really
blend
well
together
in
this
recipe
its
definitely
not
a
brew
that
i
could
drink
many
of
in
a
sitting
but
its
refreshing
and
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
pint
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
and
low
carbonation
overall
i
cannot
imagine
this
being
hard
to
drink
for
anybody
its
refreshing
which
most
smoked
beers
are
probably
not
in
this
category
and
extremely
enjoyable
very
good
smoked
beer
too
bad
id
have
to
take
out
a
2nd
mortgage
to
drink
haandbryggeriets
product
on
a
regular
basis
it
tastes
very
nicely
and
ballanced
of
amber
malts
hops
smoke
and
juniper
and
it
just
feels
great
full
and
creamy
body
with
moderately
low
carbonation
just
the
way
i
like
it
not
a
beer
to
drink
lots
of
in
one
go
but
could
definetly
drink
this
one
pretty
often
the
feel
is
surprisingly
creamy
it
comes
through
with
a
medium
texture
and
a
good
feel
overall
a
sipper
as
it
is
so
rich
this
is
a
gnarly
beer
not
a
beer
i
would
return
to
just
given
my
own
personal
tastes
but
a
great
one
to
try
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
drinkable
and
flavorful
beer
but
the
juniper
just
really
isnt
my
thing
it
felt
a
little
too
sweet
and
herbal
to
me
but
i
really
did
like
the
smoked
malt
in
it
quite
a
challenging
and
yet
still
wellmade
smoked
ale
the
relatively
laidback
nature
is
refreshing
to
a
point
and
this
would
likely
be
a
perfect
pairing
for
any
kind
of
food
that
has
itself
seen
fire
particularly
in
any
sort
of
grungy
campsite
nice
mild
smoked
beer
not
very
overpowering
nicely
blended
and
enjoyable
o
definitely
a
beer
that
im
pissed
i
didnt
buy
another
bottle
of
this
works
perfectly
between
smoked
malts
and
sweet
malts
a
touch
of
herbal
flavors
and
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
very
enjoyable
beer
on
a
cold
rainy
spring
day
spot
on
o
overall
a
pleasant
experience
though
nothing
mindblowing
simply
put
a
tasty
ale
that
has
the
potential
to
be
outstanding
but
comes
across
as
just
above
average
overall
a
solid
brew
interesting
to
try
a
wonderfully
flavorful
and
balanced
smoked
beer
although
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
all
night
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
down
a
refill
d
norwegian
woods
rates
well
in
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
but
it
simply
does
not
deliver
on
taste
so
drinkability
suffers
i
do
not
think
i
need
to
revisit
this
beer
here
is
an
engaging
beer
historic
interesting
and
exciting
its
a
deep
brown
color
quite
clear
with
a
fizzy
white
head
moderately
stable
the
aroma
has
a
smoke
and
wood
scent
along
with
a
spice
and
malt
quality
firm
bitterness
in
the
flavor
the
beer
has
lots
of
woody
tannic
astringency
its
a
beer
with
a
considerable
bitterness
although
not
a
hop
bitterness
perhaps
contributed
by
the
juniper
twigs
slightly
smoky
although
not
as
much
as
i
expected
nice
body
not
a
great
beer
and
certainly
not
my
style
but
very
interesting
a
year
and
a
half
past
its
best
before
date
the
beer
still
has
nice
character
and
flavors
however
based
on
this
tasting
it
shows
that
this
one
can
take
the
aging
but
likely
not
improve
would
try
again
fresher
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
smoked
ale
not
over
the
top
with
smokiness
it
had
just
enough
note
batch

brewed

real
drinkable
even
if
you
are
new
to
the
style
nice
balance
and
not
cloying
very
good
brew
a
nice
smoked
beer
with
enough
smoke
to
be
present
and
some
good
yeasty
notes
the
appearance
is
a
cloudy
mostly
brown
with
shades
of
red
and
a
tanish
half
finger
of
foam
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
rather
nice
considering
that
this
beer
is
technically
supposed
to
be
past
its
prime
march
2010
the
smells
are
mostly
a
nice
roast
with
a
deep
chocolate
aroma
and
slight
trails
of
smoked
malts
the
flavor
is
pretty
damn
good
it
starts
out
with
a
malty
sweetness
and
finished
with
a
decent
amount
of
peat
smoke
on
the
tongue
the
first
sip
was
much
better
than
the
following
ones
resulting
in
the
ratings
that
are
seen
before
you
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
watery
side
imo
due
to
the
flavors
on
hand
the
beer
is
rather
drinkable
and
i
must
admit
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
red
with
a
good
head
and
good
lace
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
smoky
with
a
mild
funkiness
and
some
smoked
meat
there
is
some
wood
and
fruitiness
and
a
mild
sweet
aroma
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
follows
but
its
nicely
bitter
compared
to
other
smoky
beers
ive
had
there
is
some
sweet
smoke
and
plenty
of
woodiness
and
a
fair
bit
of
earthiness
in
there
as
well
delicious
it
could
be
that
im
drinking
this
a
week
before
christmas
but
this
really
has
a
warm
holiday
feel
to
it
the
smoky
aspects
are
distinct
but
they
dont
overwhelm
and
the
layers
of
flavor
and
spice
are
reminiscent
of
a
winter
warmer
although
not
quite
as
dense
and
bogged
down
good
stuff
my
first
from
haandbryggeriet
d
solid
beer
the
smoke
was
not
as
upfront
as
i
thoughtd
be
very
tasty
verdict
not
quite
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
but
if
you
see
it
you
should
try
it
for
its
unique
qualities
body
is
a
little
thin
but
the
somewhat
low
carbonation
seems
appropriate
somehow
another
solid
interesting
and
enjoyable
scandinavian
beer
just
wish
the
prices
were
as
easy
to
swallow
as
the
delicious
beer
is
drinkability
my
first
smoked
beer
and
im
very
intrigued
by
the
style
this
is
a
sipper
to
experience
the
nuances
of
the
style
good
d
certainly
not
a
bad
drink
but
one
pint
is
all
i
could
do
in
a
single
sitting
great
beer
to
share
if
you
can
find
another
smoked
beer
lover
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
medium
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
sour
cherries
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
oatmeal
up
front
with
a
hint
of
tobacco
smoke
in
the
middle
and
a
leathery
earthy
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
slightly
high
carbonation
good
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
with
a
unique
taste
that
i
would
get
again
enjoyable
hell
yes
to
the
norwegians
for
this
wonderful
smoked
beer
i
really
liked
all
its
balanced
parts
everything
fits
very
well
together
with
nothing
to
over
the
top
with
a
very
fresh
wholesome
craft
and
subtleness
that
i
found
to
me
very
much
to
my
liking
for
a
smoked
beer
overall
nothing
i
enjoyed
too
much
not
very
drinkable
and
i
am
starting
to
like
smoked
beers
more
this
one
just
didnt
work
for
me
it
might
be
hard
to
finish
this
one
db
good
stuff
becomes
fruity
at
the
end
many
nice
flavors
that
balance
fairly
well
i
think
i
would
prefer
less
fruit
but
it
is
still
a
good
beer
d
a
tasty
brew
i
recommend
sharing
the
bottle
as
its
better
in
small
quantities
d
very
balanced
for
a
smoked
beer
the
flavor
never
becomes
overwhelming
drinkability
i
like
the
mix
of
of
the
smoke
and
sweet
florals
i
wish
the
malt
here
was
a
tad
less
pale
and
the
florals
were
a
bit
more
present
this
is
an
interesting
beer
worth
picking
up
not
sure
if
i
would
get
this
again
but
certainly
worth
the
try
notes
try
this
beer
its
smokey
old
fashioned
and
uniquely
brewed
definately
a
potent
taste
burst
just
have
it
in
smaller
doses
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
wish
it
were
more
assertive
though
this
beer
would
work
best
when
paired
with
food
thanks
again
mikeyv35
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
with
a
modest
nose
and
a
powerful
taste
adding
the
wild
growing
herbs
to
the
mix
absolutely
adds
a
sting
to
the
whole
mix
norwegian
wood
never
tasted
as
good
as
this
it
took
me
a
while
but
i
finally
got
a
second
chance
at
this
beer
it
pours
a
translucent
tawny
amber
more
toward
the
brown
end
of
the
spectrum
topped
by
over
a
fingerandahalf
of
creamcolored
foam
the
smell
comprises
smoked
ham
roasted
malts
light
toffee
and
wheat
though
smokey
notes
dominate
the
taste
holds
notes
of
everything
listed
above
though
the
smoke
is
toned
down
slightly
the
toffee
is
joined
bvy
a
light
caramel
and
the
wheat
is
toasted
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
lightly
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
smoked
beer
one
that
i
wish
was
easier
to
obtain
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
is
outstanding
a
pleasure
to
savor
the
flavors
as
i
drink
imagining
this
beer
being
brewed
on
a
norwegian
farm
using
traditional
process
kudos
to
haandbryggeriet
for
a
winning
recreation
of
this
traditional
norwegian
style
i
found
this
to
be
somewhat
lighter
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
i
dare
say
it
was
somewhere
along
the
watery
lines
which
was
interesting
because
it
certainly
did
not
taste
that
way
all
in
all
a
very
strange
consistency
very
sessionable
so
much
so
that
i
had
to
remind
myself
of
the
price
tag
i
would
definitely
try
again

it
is
not

this
one
surely
is
a
well

smoked
beer
quite
tasty
with
plenty

an

that
accents
the
smoked

goes
down
easy

its
fairly
well
balanced
d
ok
drinking
it
alone
right
now
its
a

probably

with

in
the
back
its
like
a
smokey

or
something
like
that
almost
like
a

pretty
good
beer
an
interesting
brew
on
sweet
side
but
with
balance
notably
though
not

smokey
sounded
like
it
would
be
like
a
smoked

but

comes
across
differently
here
a
unique
brew
dont

that
i
would
have
it
again
for
the
hefty

for
the

was

overall
this
smoked
beer
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
from
schlenkerla
and
the
juniper
adds
just
a
hint
of
earthiness
thats
well
served
here
if
youre
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
then
this
one
is
well
worth
a
shot
interesting
label
note
at
one
time
in
norway
every
farm
was
required
to
brew
its
own
ale
not
sure
if
they
were
required
to
drink
it
though
good
drinkability
i
really
like
these
smoke
ales
and
this
is
another
one
that
didnt
disappoint
on
tap
at
maxs
very
filling
and
creamy
tasty

not

interesting
kudos
to
the

id
have
it
again
lively
out

a
lovely
dark

colour
with
a

sized
creamy

and
an
abundance
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
heavily

some

there
is
also
a

the
smokiness

a

some

from

the

the

has
a
rough
quality
to
it
really
interesting
beer
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
its
different
and
well
worth
finding
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
little
boring
and
onedimensional
worth
a
try
if
you
like
smoked
beers
not
the
most
drinkable
style
for
my
taste
and
it
will
take
me
a
while
to
get
through
this
thanks
to
the
complexities
and
substantial
body
but
i
certainly
recommend
this
to
fans
of
smoked
beers
this
is
much
more
interesting
than
a
run
of
the
mill
smoked
porter
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
and
may
again
someday
d
certainly
an
interesting
beer
and
one
to
at
least
try
once
a
very
pleasant
wellbalanced
and
easily
drinkable
smoke
beer
good
sessionability
i
was
anticipating
this
to
be
more
complex
than
it
ended
up
being
mouthfeel
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
to
balance
out
the
smoke
the
addition
of
juniper
twigs
and
berries
is
rather
subtle
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
as
one
can
get
carried
away
with
junipers
regardless
this
beer
is
not
for
nonsmoke
ale
lovers
this
is
all
that
and
a
bag
of
smoldering
embers
that
said
this
is
a
split
a
bottle
with
a
friend
beer
as
its
rather
hard
to
finish
an
entire
one
and
were
smoked
beer
lovers
this
one
finished
with
a
med
body
and
a
good
lingering
smoke
flavor
on
the
pallet
a
really
nice
smoke
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
mild
smoked
beer
that
i
actually
enjoyed
maybe
its
time
for
me
to
try
the
more
difficult
ones
again

pours
out
to
a
hazy
very
dark
brown
forming
a
modest
dark
tan
head
with
poor
retention
and
absent
lacing
lots
of
dark
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
nice
little
yeasty
beasties
the
aroma
is
nice
and
rich
with
smoke
and
caramel
maybe
a
little
sour
milk
with
swirling
mouthfeel
is
bright
with
a
medium
dense
body
the
taste
opens
up
with
plenty
of
smoke
i
like
my
smoked
beers
smoky
and
this
is
very
smoky
i
love
it
it
has
a
big
malt
body
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
little
earthiness
the
juniper
doesnt
stand
out
and
the
bitterness
is
mild
so
it
leaves
plenty
of
lingering
malt
in
the
aftertaste
a
hearty
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
im
not
convinced
its
worth
the
8
price
bottle
shared
with
michael
michael
and
darrell
at
pizzeria
paradiso
chestnut
colored
without
much
head
or
lacing
aroma
reminiscent
of
the
leather
straps
that
old
fashioned
barber
chairs
used
to
have
taste
has
some
dark
fruit
and
cherries
progressing
to
beef
jerky
then
finishing
with
barbecued
bacon
nicely
complex
overall
an
excellent
and
quite
complex
smoked
beer
well
worth
a
try
no
smoke
beer
lover
should
not
try
this
if
they
can
an
okay
smoked
beer
but
after
this
one
i
would
rather
to
back
to
a
more
traditional
rauchbier
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
solid
spritzy
carbonation
goes
down
easy
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
interesting
tasty
brew
that
i
would
have
again
first
off
i
love
smoked
beers
especially
those
like
the
aecht
schlerenka
variety
where
the
smoke
is
strong
pours
dark
brown
with
nice
red
edges
thick
head
that
last
the
whole
way
down
not
much
lacing
beautiful
campfire
aroma
great
mix
of
wood
with
the
juniper
showing
through
oily
mouthfeel
with
enough
carbonation
to
smooth
it
out
long
earthy
finish
the
taste
is
spectacular
wood
smoke
and
bacon
the
malt
is
rich
and
hearty
but
maintains
a
pleasant
dry
quality
good
mix
with
the
chocolate
malt
gives
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
not
too
much
to
overtake
the
smokiness
i
love
this
beer
if
youre
going
to
go
smoked
go
the
whole
way
drinkability
is
good
the
flavors
are
well
proportioned
and
the
smoke
compliments
the
malts
quite
well
a
tasty
smoked
beer
that
drinks
very
nicely
cheers
an
interesting
mix
of
smoke
and
juniper
norwegian
wood
pours
a
reddish
mahogany
color
with
an
excellent
head
the
aroma
is
strongly
smoky
with
a
light
alcohol
note
the
juniper
doesnt
really
come
through
until
you
get
to
the
flavor
altogether
its
an
interesting
mix
of
spruce
smokehouse
meats
sweet
malt
and
spice
as
it
warms
up
theres
a
light
phenolic
note
the
smoke
doesnt
dominate
the
flavor
profile
as
it
does
in
the
aroma
it
sits
well
on
the
palate
fairly
light
carbonation
smooth
feel
im
not
sure
how
much
smoked
beer
i
can
ever
stomach
in
one
sitting
but
its
certainly
enjoyable
by
the
half
liter
m
d
a
nice
prickle
of
carbonation
right
off
the
top
introducing
a
bigger
sized
body
heavy
side
of
medium
i
suppose
would
be
the
most
accurate
i
can
come
up
with
using
a
limited
descriptive
phrase
bank
the
amount
of
alcohol
is
quite
low
though
admittedly
i
expected
it
to
be
considerably
higher
8
or
even
9
but
no
complaints
there
is
a
lot
to
be
said
for
a
beer
that
is
able
to
be
on
the
lower
alcohol
side
with
this
kind
of
flavour
this
beer
pours
a
thick
toffee
color
with
an
off
white
one
finger
head
that
recedes
quickly
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
of
caramel
malts
dark
fruits
and
berries
and
a
hint
of
smokiness
taste
is
berries
and
dark
fruit
at
the
forefront
caramel
malts
fill
out
the
middle
and
a
hop
finish
throughout
the
whole
beer
a
nice
balance
of
smokiness
plays
against
the
tastes
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
somewhat
oily
at
first
and
fills
out
to
a
nice
creaminess
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sit
with
for
a
little
bit
not
as
interesting
a
beer
as
i
had
hoped
but
its
still
quite
drinkable
d
the
smoke
is
powerful
and
does
make
it
hard
to
get
through
a
unique
mouthwatering
concoction
that
would
pair
well
with
properly
prepared
saltcod
rakfisk
wild
game
and
wild
greens
d
one
of
the
meatiest
beers
ive
ever
had
for
sure
isnt
it
good
norwegian
wood
yes
it
is
the
taste
has
some
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
molasses
or
brown
sugar
and
of
course
plenty
of
smoke
the
smoke
is
not
overpowering
and
honestly
is
very
very
well
balanced
for
a
smoked
beer
although
ive
had
better
smoked
beers
i
havent
had
many
that
had
such
a
good
balance
of
medium
body
and
nonoverpowering
smoke
flavor
that
i
would
be
able
and
want
to
drink
more
than
one
this
would
age
well
may
buy
a
few
to
lay
down
and
try
this
winter
and
next
spring
i
drank
this
at
room
temp
but
i
think
it
could
have
used
some
fridge
time
very
interesting
beer
though
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
decent
malt
scent
of
roasted
crystal
and
peated
malts
the
smoke
aroma
is
mild
with
a
nice
roasted
dryness
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
very
smooth
peated
flavor
thats
balanced
with
crystal
and
roasted
malts
there
is
a
slight
juniper
berry
taste
up
front
but
it
fades
quickly
with
the
smoke
overcoming
it
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
tastey
beer
ive
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
awhile
d
good
drinkability
with
a
complex
flavor
and
interesting
finish
this
one
would
be
easier
to
understand
and
appreciate
under
the
category
of
a
smoked
beer
d
while
drinking
this
beer
is
an
unusual
experience
it
is
definitely
drinkable
certainly
not
for
everyone
this
brew
pours
up
an
opaque
reddish
brown
color
with
dark
peach
edges
and
a
nice
off
white
head
the
nose
is
smoked
bacon
smoked
ham
smoked
pork
burnt
wood
the
taste
is
a
lol
rough
on
the
edges
i
get
very
smoky
pig
products
subtle
malts
slight
hop
bittering
no
juniper
twigs
though
medium
body
high
smooth
carbo
a
decent
smoked
brew
dark
brown
body
with
hints
of
ruby
under
a
fluffy
light
tan
head
the
nose
has
smoke
but
not
much
and
a
powdered
chocolate
smell
and
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
there
is
a
nice
spiciness
at
first
then
some
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
all
of
the
flavors
really
blend
together
well
spicy
then
bitter
then
sweet
with
a
little
spiciness
left
behind
it
has
a
nice
tight
carbonation
that
makes
the
flavors
open
up
a
bit
more
it
is
like
a
palo
santo
light
and
that
is
a
good
thing
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
have
no
plans
to
ever
purchase
it
again
this
is
just
an
ok
beer
could
be
much
better
with
not
so
much
burnt
wood
drinkability
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
a
major
detraction
from
drinkability
very
dense
head
surface
looks
like
rolling
hills
of
offwhite
little
lacing
and
while
it
starts
off
over
three
fingers
deep
steadily
evaporates
downwards
very
dark
redbrown
color
only
if
you
hold
the
glass
close
to
a
light
does
the
transparency
become
evident
in
the
nose
its
easy
to
finger
all
the
smokiness
but
its
not
a
one
trick
pony
behind
this
lays
medicinal
witch
hazel
cocoa
powder
fried
in
butter
campfire
ashes
peat
moss
cinnamon
stick
and
a
touch
of
caramel
and
toffee
for
shock
absorption
very
light
squeak
of
mixed
black
fruit
scents
mediumbodied
if
you
could
turn
your
mouth
into
a
fire
burning
oven
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
a
metallic
cave
water
tar
and
lapsang
souchong
tea
leaves
keeps
it
aggressive
the
carbonation
acts
like
a
thin
jet
stream
through
the
palate
not
steadily
stirring
the
pot
but
creating
turbulence
piney
juniper
berry
influence
otherwise
the
fruit
element
is
very
low
likewise
no
citrus
of
note
anise
seed
and
dried
strips
of
game
less
chocolate
or
caramel
clean
finish
with
expected
big
inner
mouth
perfume
a
very
good
curiosity
couldnt
drink
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
d
ill
certainly
have
again
the
berries
and
smoke
play
well
together
solid
complex
beer
drinkability
is
really
rather
high
for
a
smoked
beer
i
could
have
drank
more
than
one
of
these
and
the
sweetness
in
this
coupled
with
the
smoke
would
make
this
an
absolute
grand
slam
with
pulled
pork
barbecue
unique
drinkable
and
worth
trying
for
sure
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
ive
had
its
worth
a
taste
overall
i
received
this
beer
as
a
christmas
present
its
the
first
beer
of
this
style
ive
had
and
im
enjoying
it
ive
got
another
scandinavian
beer
to
try
later
word
beer
my
natural
inclination
would
be
the
pair
this
with
smoked
pork
since
that
is
basically
what
it
tastes
like
i
would
be
a
bit
concerned
that
pairing
smoked
beer
with
smoked
meat
would
be
too
much
and
i
might
opt
for
grilled
pork
loin
instead
i
like
it
but
probably
wont
return
for
another
d
a
slightly
different
take
on
a
smoked
beer
that
may
be
very
appealing
if
you
like
that
kind
of
thing
if
smoked
beers
arent
your
thing
this
still
might
be
worth
trying
as
an
entry
to
the
flavor
but
it
would
be
best
to
share
the
larger
sized
bottle
alcohol
is
not
much
of
a
factor
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
aroma
dominated
by
smokey
malts
and
wood
also
contains
hints
of
fig
and
dark
fruits
flavor
again
is
domnated
by
smoky
woody
maltiness
that
is
nicely
balanced
with
fig
spice
and
dark
fruit
very
complex
and
tasty

very

ill
definitely
have
to

from
this
brewery
assuming
i
can

i

brewi
like
smokey
beers
and
this
has
the
smoke
and
a
little
more
to
offerquite
good
overall
a
very
unique
beer
the
flavor
is
pretty
smoky
too
with
lots
of
different
notes
of
bitter
berries
prety
malty
too
and
there
are
some
nice
hoppiness
to
that
balances
all
of
it
drinkability
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
and
delicious
beer
i
will
have
to
keep
my
eye
on
this
brewery
because
this
one
hits
it
out
of
the
park
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
winter
and
fall
but
not
exactly
a
hot
summer
bbq
beer
this
is
a
great
ski
lodge
beer
very
woodsy
and
dry
but
quite
comforting
nicely
drinkable
with
pleasant
taste
and
feel
not
outstanding
in
any
particular
dimension
but
a
solid

is
mild

this
is
a

brew
recommended
overall
a
very
interesting
and
unique
brew
i
can
almost
invision
a
farmhouse
and
burning
fire
as
i
drink
it
i
dont
know
much
about
norway
but
this
beer
is
very
telling
about
its
beer
culture
one
of
a
kind
at
least
as
far
as
i
have
experienced
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
smokiness
and
mild
tartsweetness
and
maybe
a
bit
of
phenolic
weizen
peculiarity
as
well
the
flavor
seems
to
hit
the
tongue
with
smokiness
first
followed
by
some
fruitytart
flavor
maybe
thats
the
juniper
the
smokiness
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
the
best
bamberg
brews
but
the
rauch
character
isnt
as
omnipresent
as
the
schlenkerla
brews
possibly
not
as
much
as
the
spezial
brews
either
theres
a
bit
of
tartness
in
the
flavor
which
ive
had
in
some
other
smoked
brews
im
not
sure
if
its
a
result
of
the
smoked
malt
or
possibly
the
yeast
but
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
whatever
the
case
i
think
this
brew
is
catered
more
toward
those
who
like
a
somewhat
heavy
smoke
flavor
in
their
beer
if
that
sounds
like
you
but
nice
i
dont
really
taste
any
of
the
juniper
berries
either
the
carbonation
was
out
of
control
on
this
one
and
subtle
campfire
smokiness
medium
body
and
carbonation
taste
is
complex
and
quite
interesting
smoke
is
more
evident
in
the
taste
than
the
aroma
batch
nr
86
its
a
little
bit
creamy
with
some
lively
carbonation

must

that
brewing
a
beer
with
smoked
malt
and
juniper

is
a
quite
daring
task
sadly

not

i
like
it
it
was
very
good
even
if
there
was
nothing
but
soccer
on
the
tele
i
dont
know
if
i
would
sit
on
this
one
id
try
to
drink
it
as
fresh
as
possible
this
seemed
to
have
a
little
age
on
it
however
i
suppose
thats
to
be
expected
as
this
was
a
tap
takeover
of
norwegian
beers
probably
had
to
sit
on
a
few
kegs
while
building
stock
for
this

500ml

very
light

as
close
to
schlenkerla
as
it
can
get
very
surprises
by
this
one
o
pretty
good
smoke
is
definitely
on
the
tame
side
for
a
smoked
beer
but
it
mixes
well
a
nice
array
of
flavors
think
rye
beerlightly
smoked

if
that
makes
any
sense
a
unique
brew
kind
of
in
the
line
of
a
saison
and
biere
de
garde
a
nice
rustic
style
o
some
people
may
shy
away
from
smoked
beers
but
this
is
relatively
tame
and
the
smoke
makes
the
taste
interesting
but
doesnt
overpower
it
the
best
way
i
could
describe
this
is
its
kind
of
like
a
smoked

some
quite
flavourful

and
well

im
really
loving
what
haand
doesthis
one
may
be
the
finest
of
theirs
ive
tried
to
date
a
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
ale
the
mix
of
grains
making
for
a
downhome
rustic
elixir
experience
was
a
hit
in
my
family
home
i
was
expecting
a
fresh
hopped
ale
and
found
some
smoke
different
but
worth
a
try
well
crafted
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
much
darker
than
schlenkerla
helles
as
in
orange
gold
pour
is
a
nice
head
that
lets
out
so
much
apple
and
woody
acid
leather
notes
all
in
a
cloud
of
floral
perfume
automatically
the
question
not
to
ask
is
whether
this
is
a
superior
beer
its
more
astringent
but
still
balanced
palate
of
chalk
smoke
in
one
spectrum
and
apple
pie
and
hints
of
sour
notes
that
all
combine
into
a
grassy
bitter
end
well
carbonated
ready
for

i
love
this

very

and
a

but
smoke
is
much
more
prominant
followed
by
a
sweet
tang
that
really
works
to
balance
the
whold
finish
is
like
flavor
and
has
a
long
duration
bit
boozy
there
at
the
end
too
session
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
kind
of
thing
i
rarely
am
theres
the
smoke
nice
camp
fire
type
smoke
some
wood
some
grass
some
grains
toasty
malt
the
spice
is
light
but
unapologetic
carbonation
adds
to
the
feel
of
it
being
refreshing
light
body
very
nice
drinking
overall
i
enjoy
good
smoked
beers
and
this
one
is
pretty
good
a
little
more
smoke
as
it
warmed
could
have
made
it
a
bit
better
but
its
still
a
good
smoked
beer
overall
this
beer
might
be
trying
to
cram
too
much
into
one
drink
but
it
is
good
tasting
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
and
easy
to
drink
gusher
when
opened
at
a
cold
temperature
pours
a
slightlymurky
orangecopper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
into
a
thin
collar
the
nose
carries
some
light
smoke
and
a
bit
of
wood
and
spice
the
flavor
is
fairly
smoked
with
a
bit
of
the
woody
character
maintained
not
a
strong
smoke
character
but
there
is
a
lot
of
the
moderate
smokeyness
if
they
makes
sense
overcarbonated
and
a
light
fizzy
body
not
a
huge
fan
o
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
enjoyable
drink
enjoyed
the
smoked
malts
and
sweet
belgian
like
qualities
play
against
each
other
perfect
medium
bodied
ale
for
a
hot
day
like
today
when
a
stout
would
be
too
much
i
think
this
is
a
great
farmhouse
style
beer
t
offers
a
very
different
sort
of
malt
complexity
than
most
saisons
or
bier
de
gardes
pretty
smooth
and
rather
refreshing
i
will
buy
it
again
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
overall
a
nice
beer
drinkability
if
smoke
is
your
game
then
this
beer
is
what
your
looking
for
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
but
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
while
i
tend
to
divert
from
this
style
i
do
have
to
say
that
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
tried
would
consider
drinking
it
again
and
thats
saying
something
a
nice
tasty
beer
with
plenty
of
flavour
yum
my
girlfriend
doent
like
smoked
beers
but
she
liked
this
one
and
so
did
i
in
my
book
that
says
something
d
i
would
have
liked
the
flavors
to
be
more
in
balance
here
or
at
least
a
bitter
mirror
of
the
aromas
agree
very
much
with
the
previous
reviewer
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
but
its
all
but
impossible
to
say
whether
it
works
as
a
package
interesting
as
hell
but
a
bit
jumbled
rating
to
style
is
hard
what
do
you
compare
it
to
a
bit
odd
and
kinda
tiresome
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
with
food
i
expect
itd
be
different
get
me
some
smelly
washedrind
cheese
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
itd
be
ideal
unaccompanied
the
chief
attraction
is
probably
the
novelty
drinkability
is
only
ok
if
you
can
handle
the
smoke
hesjeøl
is
the
first
beer
from
haandbryggeriet
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
not
too
smokey
for
being
a
smoked
beer
and
had
a
little
sweetness
in
the
malt
it
poured
with
a
little
bit
of
white
froth
and
had
a
mediumfull
bodied
texture
to
me
some
beers
really
are
an
experience
to
drink
and
some
maybe
more
for
their
rarity
than
purely
by
their
taste
smoke
beers
sour
ales
chile
beers
are
few
and
far
between
and
i
think
that
counts
for
something
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
it
was
definitely
out
of
the
ordinary
and
left
me
wanting
more
from
norway
pours
with
an
offwhite
twofinger
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaving
some

medium

not

lots

this
beer
i
like
seeing
more

options

at

showcase
that
flavor
to
a
larger

d
haandbryggeriet

a
try

something

dont
expect
anything
near

topped
by
a
finger
of
thick
offwhite
froth
that
tries
to
live

ultimately
fails
ah
the
mortality
of
bubbles
the
nose
exhibits
a
healthy
dose
of
peat
smoke
up
front
almost
like
fiery
oregano
or
something
with
some
wheat
grasses
and
wood
making
up
a
rather
rustic
backdrop
the
taste
holds
a
rather
more
subdued
smoky
character
still
fairly
dark
that
served
as
a
compliment
to
the
somewhat
citrusy
and
flowery
wheat
notes
imagine
a
very
subtly
hopped

which
was
then
nicely
smoked

times
baby

find

to

drinkable

to
pick

savor

enjoy
the
refreshing
taste

id
score
it
higher
if
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
more
i
couldnt
see
drinking
too
much
of
this
at
one
sitting
but
it
is
tasty
to
just
enjoy
occasionally
drinkability
good
d
an
interesting
drinkable
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
normally
smoked
beers
are
heavy
handed
with
the
smokiness
but
the
smoke
in
this
one
wasnt
overpowering
at
all
f
small
finish
especially
for
a
smoked
beer
a
little
sweetness
but
it
dries
well
slight
malt
and
molasses
more
light
smoke
and
some
dry
smokey
malts
as
well
as
a
slight
spicy
hop
it
finishes
short
and
then
just
disappears
d
one
never
knows
what
to
expect
with
these
revivalist
traditional
beers
and
aside
from
smoke
i
really
wasnt
sure
what
i
was
getting
into
when
i
popped
the
cap
off
of
this
bottle
i
expected
something
spicy
probably
with
some
juniper
instead
i
get
a
lot
of
toasty
brown
malt
and
muddy
clove
and
allspicecinnamon
its
kind
of
like
a
belgian
pumpkin
ale
it
isnt
really
an
unpleasant
combination
but
there
is
something
missing
it
seems
like
it
needs
a
bright
note
of
hops
acidity
or
a
pungent
spice
like
coriander
to
lift
the
heavy
malt
and
smoke
off
the
palate
as
it
is
it
becomes
a
bit
cloying
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
and
is
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
it
might
be
nevertheless
it
is
an
interesting
rustic
beer
and
not
quite
like
anything
else
that
i
have
had
before
overall
this
was
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
recently
it
went
down
easy
no
surprise
as
it
had
two
specialty
malts
i
like
a
bunch
however
it
didnt
seem
to
really
own
any
one
of
its
many
facets
still
worth
a
shot
m
really
smooth
medium
bodied
d
if
it
only
it
was
a
little
less
smoky
plus
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
rye
to
begin
with
i
can
finish
my
bottle
pretty
easily
just
not
about
to
open
another
one
this
is
definitely
a
oneatatime
beer
for
me
bottle
batch
254
home
this
beer
pours
a
tawny
shade
of
sienna
with
a
small
beigeish
head
the
aroma
is
big
mix
of
caramel
malt
spicy
rye
smoke
oak
and
floral
hops
theres
also
what
i
now
recognize
as
a
wild
yeast
note
from
haands
own
strain
the
flavor
is
medium
sweet
smoke
and
more
of
that
interesting
yeast
this
is
another
very
good
beer
from
an
excellent
brewery
im
highly
impressed
with
this
one
honestly
its
very
drinkable
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
smoke
to
allow
all
the
other
flavors
come
out
really
tasty
d
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
halfliter
on
my
own
the
overly
zesty
carbonation
was
the
only
thing
that
slowed
me
down
this
is
about
the
right
amount
of
smoke
for
me
its
a
nice
supplemental
flavor
but
something
that
can
be
easy
to
overdo
probably
wont
get
his
again
due
to
the
price
but
it
was
cool
to
try
d
another
winner
from
the
hand
brewery
this
is
according
to
their
label
a
norwegian
harvest
ale
no
such
category
exists
but
their
description
on
the
label
also
references
the
fact
that
this
is
smoky
be
sure
to
drink
the
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
o
if
you
like
smoky
scotchy
stouts
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
still
a
great
beer
probably
best
with
burnt
ends
brisket
mmmm
o
an
interesting
brew
but
not
really
to
my
taste
smoke
is
good
a
decent
smoked
beer
a
league
or
two
more
palatable
than
the
last
similar
offering
from
this
particular
nation
im
looking
straight
at
you
nøgne
ø
the
key
seems
to
be
the
integration
because
while
it
is
indeed
smoky
were
led
to
perceive
this
as
a
subattribute
of
whatever
typical
beer
meme
were
currently
sussing
out
rather
than
as
an
overarching
component
of
the
whole
as
wanky
as
that
was
its
true
and
a
straightup
compliment
to
the
brewer
im
pretty
happy
with
this
brewery
and
my
ability
to
buy
it
in
my
home
town
well
worth
trying
and
looking
for
if
your
a
smoked
malt
fan
i
enjoyed
this
offering
although
it
isnt
my
favorite
version
of
the
style
the
fruit
flavors
might
benefit
from
some
age
in
order
for
some
of
the
slightly
tart
qualities
to
mellow
which
may
allow
the
sweetness
to
turn
a
bit
richer
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
smoked
malt
with
some
caramel
malt
notes
taste
is
good
mix
between
some
smoked
malt
with
light
smoked
fish
notes
and
some
caramel
malt
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
solid
offering
with
great
balanced
taste
of
smoked
malt
and
bacon
and
smoked
fish
medium
body
with
a
long
standing
smokiness
in
the
aftertaste
with
touch
of
bitterness
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
khaki
colored
head
as
the
name
implies
very
very
smokey
a
bit
of
salt
and
cured
meat
aroma
to
it
too
some
bread
and
toast
maybe
a
little
bit
of
toffee
the
flavor
has
a
hint
of
vanilla
which
is
nice
but
the
smoke
and
salt
notes
are
almost
overwhelming
a
little
bit
nutty
and
some
sweetness
of
toffee
bread
and
toasted
malts
note
batch
426
the
beer
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
smokey
it
reminds
me
of
fresh
smoked
brisket
with
a
lot
of
meaty
smoke
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
has
some
great
smoked
chocolate
notes
as
well
as
some
roasted
malt
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
its
another
interesting
beer
from
haand
but
this
one
works
a
little
less
than
some
of
their
others
again
they
have
some
interestingly
odd
characters
to
it
but
its
a
little
bit
skewed
towards
anarchic
here
good
carbonation
standard
body
and
mouthfeel
sort
of
a
letdown
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
worth
2x
the
price
of
schlenkerla
bottles
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
too
filling
well
hidden
kick
decent
representation
of
style
id
seek
out
others
of
the
style
first
but
a
decent
offering
o
quite
a
good
beer
full
of
flavor
without
being
tiring
though
it
is
not
entirely
easy
drinking
decent
though
unexceptional
smoked
beer
greyish
tinged
body
with
some
retained
offwhite
head
average
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
with
lunch
booze
not
too
detectable
a
tad
of
woodiness
bottle
from
trade
some
chocolate
malt
and
on
the
sweetish
side
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
soft
white
head
that
slowly
dissolves
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
with
subtle
smoke
and
slight
chocolate
strong
estery
taste
with
the
dark
fruit
very
pronounced
up
front
followed
by
chocolate
with
the
smoke
lingering
on
the
back
end
of
the
beer
this
beer
has
less
smoke
than
another
of
haandbryggeriets
beers
norwegian
wood
which
did
disappoint
me
i
would
like
the
smoke
to
be
more
prevelant
but
this
was
still
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
like
norwegian
wood
better
my
last
bit
o
smoked
goodness
for
a
bit
stupid
lack
of
unlimited
funds
but
some
good
stuff
recently
this
capstone
pours
a
murky
garnetauburn
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
charred
wood
toffee
toasted
biscuits
and
a
small
amount
of
pine
sap
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
toffee
and
smoke
intertwining
nicely
behaving
themselves
the
whole
time
some
mandarin
oranges
somehow
sneak
their
way
into
the
proceedings
oddly
enough
the
smoke
really
doesnt
dominate
as
i
expected
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
slightly
dry
feel
man
has
my
tongue
been
workedover
a
bit
here
overall
a
very
nice
smokebased
brew
but
one
that
could
somehow
stand
to
have
a
bit
more
smoke
involved
still
another
nicelycrafted
piece
from
the
haand
boys
another
fine
brew
from
mr
haand
this
brew
pours
a
dark
murky
kola
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamyfrothy
two
finger
head
that
stays
and
leaves
heaps
of
lacing
all
over
the
shopthe
smell
is
a
combination
of
smokey
baconroasted
maltschichorylight
liquorice
and
a
tinge
of
herbal
hopsit
has
a
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
which
coats
the
mouth
with
smokey
bacontoasted
marshmallowschichorybeef
jerky
and
finishes
with
a
herbal
hoppy
bitterness
and
overall
very
nice
and
would
drink
again
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thick
bubbly
collar
quick
quickly
with
only
a
spot
or
two
of
lacing
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
nose
comes
forward
with
some
nice
roasted
malt
and
then
theres
just
a
touch
of
smoke
in
the
background
the
flavor
has
a
bit
more
smoke
and
less
of
the
roast
in
addition
theres
some
cocoa
and
a
bit
of
strong
bold
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderatelyhigh
carbonation
slight
fizz
on
the
backend
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
a
bit
smokey
nicely
done
m
the
smoke
is
chewy
meaty
and
a
standout
it
coats
the
tastebuds
with
a
rich
flavor
that
isnt
too
heavy
the
darker
malts
yeast
strain
and
smoke
all
work
nicely
together
overall
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
pretty
tasty
and
well
balanced
but
i
wish
that
it
had
more
of
a
smoke
component
and
wasnt
so
burnt
tasting
worth
checking
out
if
youre
a
smokehead
but
not
something
i
would
likely
purchase
again
overall
a
decent
smoked
beer
but
just
not
very
pronounced
in
any
aspect
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
smoked
beer
nothing
ground
breaking
but
a
well
done
not
overly
smokey
beer
doesnt
have
the
liquid
baconham
that
others
are
known
for
but
has
just
enough
to
make
you
notice
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
overall
pretty
solid
all
around
a
good
not
so
jaring
smokey
beer
for
people
who
might
want
to
try
one
for
the
first
time
a
decent
beer
with
lots
of
flavour
really
nice
the
smopke
is
well
balanced
and
there
are
some
fine
esters
in
there
the
taste
starts
with
a
smokey
caramel
and
coffee
then
the
middle
unloads
more
of
the
bamberg
smoked
malts
but
you
also
get
some
chocolate
flavors
as
well
the
finish
is
a
slightly
gritty
and
well
carbonated
palate
with
smokey
rye
bread
crust
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
bacon
and
wood
this
is
a
great
smoke
beer
probably
on
the
top
tier
of
smoked
beers
that
i
can
enjoy
and
would
buy
again
overall
a
solid
rare
import
dnot
as
bold
as
i
like
in
therms
of
the
smoke
but
a
well
put
together
beer
500ml
bottle
served
in
a
tank
7
tulip
poured
a
deep
brown
with
two
fingers
of
tan
head
smokey
aroma
with
a
little
sausage
dark
malt
also
a
fair
amount
of
citrus
hops
medium
bodied
plenty
of
smoke
in
the
flavor
along
with
hop
bitterness
smoke
lingers
in
the
finish
the
smoke
flavor
became
a
little
like
liquid
smoke
as
it
warmed
which
distracted
one
of
these
is
plenty
excellent
beer
the
smoke
is
present
in
the
taste
and
aroma
without
being
overpowering
there
is
a
nice
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
i
get
a
load
of
peat
and
almost
a
hint
of
bacon
i
am
not
big
into
smoked
beers
but
i
love
this
one
i
could
drink
a
pint
of
this
easily
d
a
very
impressive
smoked
porter
with
a
fantastic
body
that
actually
helps
its
drinkability
dont
expect
to
be
beaten
over
the
head
with
an
overabundance
of
flavors
this
beer
does
have
the
same
understated
beauty
of
other
haandbryggeriet
brews
i
have
enjoyed
really
good
use
of
all
the
ingredients
fantastic
balance
no
flaws
that
i
can
detect
if
you
like
smoke
pick
this
up
d
i
would
have
like
to
have
paired
this
with
something
barbecuebased
very
smooth
just
very
smoky
worth
seeking
out
a
good
job
mixing
2
elements
from
2
vastly
different
regions
definitely
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
i
have
tasted
that
isnt
a
failed
experiment
d
lately
ive
been
craving
smokysmoked
beers
and
this
fit
the
bill
quite
nicely
earthy
and
smoky
without
being
forced
rich
and
satisfying
without
being
too
filling
excellent
like
the
thinking
here
just
not
there
yet
paired
well
with
some
smoked
wi
goat
cheese
both
found
at
groppi
foods
in
milwaukee
pours
with
a
nice
frothy
head
and
smells
deliciously
smoky
if
i
could
make
an
air
freshener
that
smelled
like
this
beer
id
be
happy
as
a
pig
in
shit
but
unfortunately
it
may
end
there
i
enjoy
it
and
give
props
to
its
high
quality
but
i
dot
think
i
can
drink
a
whole
lot
of
it
i
find
it
hard
to
give
any
low
marks
except
for
drinkability
and
believe
i
would
be
wrong
it
i
did
ive
had
many
smoked
beers
that
have
way
higher
drinkability
but
just
find
myself
hitting
a
wall
with
it
its
worth
trying
for
sure
but
maybe
recommend
splitting
with
a
friend
as
i
wish
i
had
done
d
a
well
made
solid
drinkable
beer
drinkability
was
excellent
a
very
easy
drinking
smoked
beer
that
is
by
no
means
overwhelming
a
smoked
beer
fan
myself
i
found
the
transition
of
flavors
refreshing
and
intriguing
worth
a
try
if
available
in
your
area
very
dark
nearly
black
colored
body
topped
with
a
thin
creamy
head
smells
of
chocolate
malt
mellow
smoke
and
char
the
flavor
is
smokier
though
it
never
gets
all
that
smokey
really
chocolate
coffee
roast
a
slight
sweetness
and
some
light
black
malt
dryness
satisfying
mediumplus
body
with
some
nice
fluffiness
no
hint
of
booze
in
fact
it
was
surprising
to
see
how
strong
it
was
better
as
it
warms
closer
to
room
temperature
i
didnt
find
this
to
be
as
bold
as
some
other
people
but
it
was
certainly
enjoyable
this
was
a
wellbalanced
smoked
beer
so
considering
the
last
review
of
it
since
mine
was
over
a
year
ago
and
considering
most
negative
reviews
were
long
before
that
maybe
spring
house
improved
their
recipe
or
maybe
i
just
liked
this
beer
d
im
very
glad
to
have
a
2nd
glass
waiting
for
me
thanks
to
the
750ml
bottle
a
better
than
average
porter
with
great
looks
taste
smells
though
i
graded
the
mouthfeel
lacking
it
was
silky
smooth
i
feel
this
could
be
a
niche
porter
for
some
it
met
mine
the
amount
of
smoke
was
perfect
for
me
and
not
at
all
overbearing
glad
to
have
had
this
one
would
definitely
grab
again
d
slowww
finding
this
perfect
for
this
snowy
winter
night
with
a
whole
game
of
hockey
to
watch
through
a
whole
review
and
not
even
half
way
through
the
first
glass
very
enjoyable
beer
again
this
beer
has
distinct
notes
of
tobacco
and
smoke
so
if
you
shy
away
from
those
flavors
i
would
shy
away
i
for
one
love
the
smokey
woody
notes
and
absolutely
love
this
bsides
creation
from
spring
house
drinkability
it
would
be
tough
for
me
to
have
more
than
two
or
three
of
these
though
at
a
rocking
9
its
a
bit
powerful
and
the
smokiness
can
be
a
bit
overpoweirng
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
coming
from
right
outside
my
home
county
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
i
was
pleasantly
pleased
to
find
a
well
made
smoked
porter
here
that
kept
the
smoke
heavy
in
the
nose
but
more
subdued
in
the
taste
which
is
just
the
way
i
like
them
drinkibility
was
decent
as
well
despite
the
heavy
roasted
aspect
but
i
was
more
than
happy
to
share
this
growler
as
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
a
little
too
much
nice
effort
here
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
the
star
in
this
offering
is
no
doubt
the
heavily
roastedsmoked
barley
considering
the
abv
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
every
once
and
awhile
it
reminds
you
of
what
it
is
without
being
too
forward
or
obnoxious
sign
me
up
for
a
glass
of
this
whenever
it
is
available
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
there
is
a
long
lingering
aftertaste
of
smoked
barley
left
in
the
mouth
which
is
really
enjoyable
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
style
of
beer
is
your
thing
the
finish
of
this
brew
is
a
bit
drying
which
really
helps
to
playout
the
flavor
of
the
smoke
here
i
would
recommend
you
give
this
a
try
i
enjoyed
it
edit
having
this
on
tap
was
incredible
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
we
opened
a
growler
of
this
this
next
night
and
i
would
rate
taste
and
smell
both
4
5
only
one
day
later
in
the
growler
three
days
after
that
taste
is
a
4
5
still
but
smell
drops
to
a
4
0
growlers
were
filled
at
the
same
time
but
not
pressure
filled
or
even
in
their
growler
could
have
just
been
my
glass
but
the
beer
is
definitely
better
on
tap
matt
handed
this
to
me
with
a
two
fingers
worth
of
deeptan
head
with
very
good
retention
color
was
a
deepbrown
with
nequality
clarity
and
cola
highlights
nose
was
redolent
with
smoke
from
100
applewood
courtesy
of
a
local
butcher
shop
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
with
a
lot
of
smoke
on
the
tongue
finish
was
dry
smoky
and
simply
delicious
nice
lacing
throughout
i
could
definitely
envision
this
with
some
smoked
gouda
d
this
is
about
as
extreme
as
you
can
get
for
a
smoked
beer
but
you
know
what
i
like
it
a
lot
actually
while
its
not
something
you
can
pound
this
is
still
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
what
it
is
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
about
two
pints
of
this
in
one
sitting
d
a
strong
smoked
ale
i
would
not
seek
out
and
probably
couldnt
handle
i
whole
pint
if
i
had
to
the
heavy
handed
use
of
smoke
detracts
from
this
beer
other
than
that
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
porter
da
decent
smoked
porter
that
i
can
appreciate
for
giving
something
like
this
a
try
but
man
tone
it
down
a
bit
this
is
palate
bashing
no
way
in
hell
could
i
finish
or
want
to
finish
a
growler
of
this
heck
5
of
us
could
even
do
it
with
the
differences
in
ratings
between
last
years
batch
and
this
years
maybe
things
have
changed
and
if
they
have
it
has
been
for
the
worse
d
i
cant
imagine
getting
through
an
entire
growler
of
this
beer
if
you
like
a
good
smoked
beer
this
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
well
worth
trying
if
you
find
the
opportunity
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
14
light
brown
head
over
the
cloudy
reddish
dark
brown
brew
thick
frothy
head
falls
ever
so
slowly
with
heavy
coating
lacing
aroma
is
smoke
reminds
me
i
have
a
schlenkerla
in
the
fridge
that
is
a
good
thing
taste
starts
sweet
balancing
with
bitterness
quickly
and
smoke
is
present
throughout
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easy
and
drinkability
is
great
as
well
have
to
love
a
smoked
beer
that
actually
is
smoked
from
beginning
to
end
overall
this
was
an
outstanding
smoked
porter
that
although
have
a
mishap
in
transportation
i
think
held
up
very
well
a
little
brewery
i
have
never
heard
of
is
putting
out
some
really
top
shelf
stuff
here
well
for
them
as
this
is
simply
superb
d
what
a
treat
to
find
this
in
my
home
county
they
struck
a
very
nice
balance
with
this
one
well
worth
seeking
out
great
balance
of
fruitiness
smoked
malts
and
that
small
hint
of
brett
tasty
quite
refreshing
and
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
people
that
havent
really
acquired
a
taste
for
smoked
beers
yet
a
smoked
hoppy
amber
not
getting
the
oats
because
this
was
a
gusher
but
there
is
restrained
smoke
solid
hops
and
balance
once
it
settles
o
i
like
the
balance
of
this
beer
but
the
finish
is
a
little
off
putting
bottle
poured
an
hazy
dirty
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
peat
malt
with
some
candi
sugar
notes
and
a
bready
yeast
is
quite
singular
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
smoky
notes
with
light
peat
notes
also
discernable
some
belgian
malt
with
some
residual
sugar
that
cuts
through
some
of
the
smoke
notes
and
a
bready
yeast
to
finish
it
all
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
interesting
mix
between
a
belgian
amber
and
a
smoked
ale
though
smoked
malt
could
be
more
pronounced
overall
like
their
belgian
ipa
the
nose
doesnt
really
match
the
flavor
but
regardless
the
flavor
really
comes
together
well
with
this
one
very
complex
and
excellently
balanced
for
sure
the
palate
needs
to
be
beefed
up
for
this
to
really
get
over
the
hump
as
the
feel
holds
the
flavors
back
from
being
all
they
can
be
but
for
now
its
a
beer
you
should
check
out
if
you
get
the
chance
quality
stuff
cheers
guys
taste
is
smokey
with
clear
peatlike
character
a
peat
whisky
resemblance
is
present
some
bandaid
taste
maybe
some
iodine
the
beer
has
a
low
bitterness
and
is
a
little
sticky
on
the
lips
the
beer
is
nicely
balanced
but
the
peat
is
what
the
beer
is
all
about
pours
nice
red
with
a
thick
bubbly
head
aroma
seems
to
be
heavy
with
oak
flavor
including
vanilla
and
a
slight
fruitiness
flavor
has
a
tannic
astringent
bite
with
some
acidity
and
a
vanilla
finish
more
hints
of
oak
the
flavor
seems
thin
at
first
but
seems
to
thicken
as
it
warms
i
emphasize
that
this
beer
should
be
allowed
to
warm
somewhat
from
refrigerator
temperatures
as
the
flavor
improves
remarkably
overall
the
beer
seems
to
be
dominated
by
oak
flavors
though
this
is
not
unwelcome
the
smoke
comes
back
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
would
have
been
a
bit
better
with
some
more
abv
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
solid
likable
beer
a
bit
different
than
most
smoked
beers
but
good
nonetheless
o
the
smokiness
was
a
bit
harsh
which
isnt
what
i
like
at
all
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
thats
well
worth
a
shot
pours
a
very
cloudy
bright
yellow
with
a
splash
of
red
a
thick
frothy
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
ton
of
sticky
lacing
clinging
tightly
to
the
glass
sweet
smells
of
smoke
easily
dominate
the
nose
some
malt
and
fruity
hops
contribute
in
minor
fashion
to
the
overall
aroma
first
sip
is
smoky
but
not
over
the
top
a
strong
malt
backbone
matches
the
smoke
and
adds
to
the
overall
experience
perfectly
carbonated
makes
for
a
great
mouthfeel
very
nice
d
watery
and
thin
needed
more
guts
but
highly
drinkable
drink
i
couldnt
do
the
rauchbier
but
this
was
nice
theyre
a
bit
pricy
for
a
12oz
6
99
city
beer
store
but
if
you
have
the
chance
grab
one
a
very
nice
beer
overall
it
is
a
quirky
but
good
beer
green
bottle
but
no
noticable
damage
poured
with
a
good
sized
foamy
frothy
cream
colored
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
and
some
lace
color
is
hazy
and
has
a
tarnished
copper
amber
aroma
is
malt
toasted
oat
cereal
hint
of
smoke
flavor
has
smoke
show
much
more
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
some
yeast
not
too
complex
but
not
bad
slight
tang
also
good
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
smokey
at
first
then
tangy
ending
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
is
an
unusual
and
i
think
quite
refined
beer
it
is
made
of
barley
wheat
and
oatmeal
malts
which
lends
it
a
smooth
balanced
maltiness
although
i
am
sure
some
people
would
like
this
for
sessioning
because
it
is
very
dry
and
champagnelike
i
would
pair
it
with
food
maybe
a
green
leafy
salad
with
red
onions
a
crab
salad
roast
or
grilled
chicken
or
grilled
salmon
it
would
also
go
well
with
some
steamed
mussels
and
frites
d
i
agree
with
a
very
pleasant
beer
certainly
worth
a
taste
average
body
balance
between
candy
sugar
an
smokiness
subtle
but
pleasant
a
very
interesting
beer
one
quite
unlike
anything
ive
had
in
some
time
for
such
a
relatively
low
alcohol
beer
i
thought
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
it
enjoyable
as
an
easy
drinking
low
abv
high
in
flavor
beer
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
id
just
categorize
this
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
though
pours
an
orange
gold
color
thinner
creme
head
overall
mildly
sour
i
dont
really
get
much
smoke
tone
on
there
this
is
a
smoked
beer
nothing
severely
complex
but
decent
enough
a
nice
drinker
and
something
to
try
and
think
about
but
probably
not
something
to
go
back
to
md
rather
light
and
refreshing
on
carbonation
as
a
result
of
solid
bottleconditioning
but
the
overall
flavour
profile
tells
an
understated
story
if
it
was
to
define
itself
as
a
smoked
ale
for
the
smokiness
is
too
weak
to
balance
with
other
elements
albeit
somehow
adding
a
niche
to
the
otherwise
mundane
amber
ale
very
well
balanced
wish
they
had
this
in
a
bottle
overall
a
unique
seasonal
that
captures
the
essence
of
the
california
wild
fires
i
would
not
crave
it
but
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
it
overall
ive
had
this
before
and
will
have
it
again
its
a
must
try
for
fans
of
smoked
beers
and
wheat
ones
at
that
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
an
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
smoked
wheat
and
slight
campfire
aromas
taste
is
the
same
but
the
smoke
is
pretty
mild
flavor
wise
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
doa
aroma
is
full
of
campfire
smoke
right
off
the
bat
i
had
been
expecting
it
but
it
really
came
off
quite
strong
and
full
really
nicely
done
here
i
have
to
admit
nice
notes
of
light
chocolate
and
big
roasted
malts
are
always
a
welcome
treat
flavor
carries
this
over
quite
well
as
the
chocolate
and
earthy
notes
lay
underneath
that
wonderful
smoky
campfire
like
flavor
that
leaves
a
long
finish
drink
overall
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
the
smoke
was
very
tame
and
a
lot
more
layers
unfolded
a
well
done
beer
earns
a
better
grade
than
i
was
gonna
give
overall
this
beer
is
flat
out
interesting
the
most
different
beer
ive
ever
had
that
being
said
its
not
bad
its
just
hard
to
say
how
good
it
is
but
it
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
hands
down
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
ever
had
its
not
bad
and
its
not
great
i
guess
i
would
only
describe
it
as
interesting
and
worth
a
try
appears
a
dark
golden
color
smells
of
smoke
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
coming
through
the
first
taste
to
hit
my
palate
was
the
smokiness
followed
by
the
sweetness
this
beer
almost
has
the
sweetness
of
a
belgian
golden
ale
which
makes
for
an
odd
combination
with
the
smoke
it
is
certainly
an
interesting
combination
though
the
mouthfeel
is
not
too
heavy
but
still
satisfying
this
is
a
pleasant
session
beer
i
dont
know
that
i
would
buy
another
bottle
but
if
i
was
somewhere
where
it
was
on
draft
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
one
d
very
dthis
would
pair
perfectly
with
a
nice
socal
wildfire
tastes
like
burnt
plants
a
hint
of
zest
and
i
just
cant
get
beyond
the
smoked
character
wheres
the
wheat
it
was
a
chore
to
finish
half
a
pint
d
you
really
have
to
enjoy
smoke
to
like
this
beer
personally
it
was
far
too
much
for
me
d
a
nice
drinkable
wheat
beer
for
the
summertime
i
think
this
would
go
well
with
summer
july
bbq
i
missed
it
last
year
but
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
in
this
go
around
d
i
think
that
they
could
have
done
way
better
on
this
beer
it
honestly
seems
liked
they
half
ass
it
and
didnt
add
enough
of
anything
except
peppers
although
i
did
enjoy
the
pepper
flavor
thats
about
all
it
had
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
see
myself
drinking
these
in
my
near
future
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
the
work
aaron
is
doing
at
bootleggers
smoked
bananas
dont
sound
appealing
yet
it
works
in
this
beer
im
happy
to
see
a
locally
produced
smoked
beer
on
the
market
but
more
importantly
one
that
tastes
good
very
light
and
pretty
drinkable
but
then
its
a
summer
beer
not
my
favorite
from
new
belgium
but
i
wanna
give
another
bottle
a
go
around
ive
always
wanted
to
try
a
3
floyds
and
being
in
alaska
its
the
closest
im
going
to
get
unless
anyone
knows
how
i
can
score
some
zombie
dust
or
gumball
head
o
very
unique
to
say
the
least
but
cant
say
id
go
for
it
again
even
though
im
a
huge
fan
of
new
belgium
and
3
floyds
my
first
brewpub
i
wasnt
terribly
fond
of
this
beer
as
far
as
taste
goes
still
it
was
certainly
worth
trying
i
dont
remember
its
specific
qualities
other
than
it
being
relatively
viscous
very
dark
and
of
course
quite
smoky
oh
yes
i
am
reminded
that
it
was
somewhat
tangy
as
well
palatable
if
sipped
and
consumed
with
some
cheese
i
only
really
like
sharp
cheddar
but
i
imagine
it
would
go
well
with
blue
cheese
for
those
who
enjoy
that
overall
i
havent
had
this
style
before
but
i
really
like
it
its
interesting
and
different
and
very
drinkable
i
really
like
that
smoked
flavor
with
the
slight
sour
tang
it
really
works
for
me
i
will
look
for
this
again
the
taste
is
1010
but
i
just
wish
the
alcohol
content
was
a
little
higher
than
4
5
abv
i
hate
that
im
forced
to
type
i
think
they
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
matching
the
style
they
were
going
for
now
we
know
why
the
style
has
been
longburied
gratzers
are
disgusting
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
avoid
drinking
another
still
thats
a
minor
quibble
for
an
ale
that
both
surprised
and
surpassed
my
expectations
from
the
moment
i
poured
it
into
my
three
floydsbranded
tulippint
a
refreshing
light
ale
that
belies
its
dark
heart
an
expressively
oaksmoke
wheat
mellowed
and
wellmatched
by
its
cleanlysoured
skeleton
and
beer
that
seems
itd
be
perfect
for
a
mild
summerday
deep
on
the
continentpresumably
waiting
for
the
zombieapocalypse
to
reach
wielkopolska
apparently
smoked
beers
arent
my
thing
when
big
names
like
new
belgium
and
3
floyds
partner
up
its
fair
to
expect
big
things
and
yet
this
grätzer
managed
to
exceed
my
expectations
while
i
dont
have
enough
experience
to
speak
to
the
authenticity
of
the
recipe
i
can
say
with
certainty
that
its
among
the
most
innately
approachable
easily
quaffed
and
likely
to
be
widely
appealing
smoked
beers
ive
tried
a
very
interesting
style
which
melds
the
smoked
malts
and
porter
style
body
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
love
the
generous
pillowy
foam
head
here
which
retains
through
the
pour
complex
layers
dominate
here
with
the
result
being
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
very
successful
brew
i
cant
say
if
it
is
authentic
i
think
it
may
be
highly
recommended
and
its
underrated
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
with
this
being
my
first
smoked
beer
i
will
not
be
going
back
for
another
the
initial
taste
is
of
fire
smoke
but
the
finish
is
that
of
cigarette
smoke
which
i
am
not
a
fan
and
the
lingering
taste
is
that
of
a
beer
that
was
filtered
through
an
ash
tray
i
am
sure
this
is
for
some
just
not
for
me
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
its
not
as
bad
as
everyone
is
making
it
out
to
be
definitely
a
smokeycigarette
finish
though
love
the
label
first
gratzer
ive
ever
had
will
definitely
try
again
love
the
zombie
bike
riders
on
the
label
drinks
okay
but
doesnt
deliver
much
in
the
way
of
good
flavor
a
letdown
like
most
of
this
series
light
body
and
light
smoke
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
overall
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
this
is
about
12
way
between
schwartzbier
and
rauchbier
pours
very
dark
to
near
black
some
haze
and
tan
colored
head
lace
settled
to
a
thin
layer
nose
had
a
nice
smoked
bready
aroma
that
had
hints
of
cooked
bacon
palate
was
surprisingly
light
in
flavor
moderate
smoke
presence
bready
some
good
hop
balance
and
a
toasty
finish
very
drinkable
wish
i
had
gouda
in
the
fridge
to
pair
some
dead
styles
should
stay
dead
this
is
like
licking
an
ashtray
reminded
me
of
st
sebastian
dark
ale
in
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
definitely
more
sour
on
the
finish
however
like
drinking
a
sour
coca
cola
nat
bad
if
be
interested
in
more
from
this
style
overall
impression
is
good
really
like
the
smokesourness
notes
keeps
it
out
there
on
the
style
scale
o
this
was
an
interesting
beer
this
reminds
me
of
a
bitter
porter
good
but
something
id
want
all
the
time
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
lasts
a
while
thick
lace
painted
the
glass
during
the
session
light
smokey
aroma
with
a
mild
roasted
and
smokey
wheat
flavor
some
hints
of
coffee
and
roasted
nuts
come
through
near
the
finish
nice
bitterness
and
the
beer
has
a
dry
aftertaste
slow
sipping
but
tasty
poured
a
deep
black
body
with
brown
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
two
fingers
of
thick

head
a
very
nice
stoutlooking
beer
scents
of
roasted
malt
rye
bread
coffee
earthy
herbal
hops
and
charred

overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
uniquely
robust
aroma
that
is
rich
roasty

and
very
pleasant

very
nice
flavor

bitter
with
notes
of

overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
very
bitter
very
smokey
flavor
that
is
deep
and
strong
despite
the
beers
low
abv
very
nice
and
very
pleasant
to
the
right
palate
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
a
slightly
drying
woody
mouthfeel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
light
yet
smokey
drying
and
woody
beer
i
hesitate
to
call
it
refreshing
it
is
more
rich
in
spite
of
its
light
body
and
low
abv
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
it
is
rich
deep
bitter
and
smokey
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
it
is
very
bold
and
flavorful
despite
its
very
low
abv
the
mouthfeel
aids
the
flavor
and
contributes
to
the
light
but
full
flavor
of
the
beer
very
nice
and
well
down
o
not
very
good
every
time
i
burp
it
taste
like
cigarette
buts
im
to
be
burping
up
cigarette
buts
the
rest
of
the
night
the
only
thing
i
like
about
this
beer
is
the
bottle
i
recommend
skipping
this
one
its
bulk
of
wheat
bread
and
associated
doughy
sweetness
retreats
quickly
in
finish
and
leaves
the
taste
of
toasted
grain
and
sourness
to
continue
duel
it
out
even
late
on
the
palate
growing
spiciness
of
peppercorn
elevates
the
toast
and
smoke
and
eventually
outlasts
the
sourness
in
a
dry
and
oaky
aftertaste
there
are
some
more
detailed
reviews
that
are
very
accurate
below
but
i
would
add
that
it
is
an
exceptionally
light
beer
for
such
a
robust
taste
it
is
a
mouthful
with
very
interesting
roasty
flavors
a
nice
sour
finish
and
then
poof
its
gone
i
agree
with
another
reviewer
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
l
of
f
to
date
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
and
a
fantastic
taste
experience
i
highly
recommend
it
as
it
is
one
of
the
all
time
best
lips
of
faith
versions
to
date
shared
with
my
father
who
prefers
bock
beers
and
scotch
pours
black
with
3
fingers
of
foamy
tan
head
was
only
down
one
finger
after
5
minutes
smells
like
roasted
malt
and
faintly
of
burnt
wood
mouthfeel

clean
and
not
too
heavy
with
noticeable
carbonation
taste
is
toasty
roasty
malts
and
smoked
wood
no
sour
flavors
despite
the
description
on
the
bottle
my
father
thought
it
tasted
like
a
bass
ale
that
someone
put
out
a
cigarette
in
oh
well
i
still
liked
it
o
this
one
is
interesting
a
sour
rauchbier
its
nice
but
definitely
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
overall
very
sessionable
via
the
checked
abv
and
minimal
sweetness
a
great
fireside
beer
poured
from

beer
is

a
light

are
heavily
roasted

qualities
toasted

subtle
bitter

and
a
solid
dose
of
tang
and
sour
at
the
end
flavors
are
surprisingly
smooth
with
that
campfire
character
toned
down
a
bit
and
balanced
nicely
with
a
subtle
sourness
earthy
notes
toasted

and
tangy
sweetness
in
the

light

a
tangy

not
a
bad
beer
but
in
a
blind
test
id
probably
call
it
a
stout
maybe
a
robust

hard
to
find
anything
unique
about
this

style
gratzer
pours
a
black
color
with
a

there
is
a

the
taste

notes
much
like
a
smoked
meat
and
hints
of
sourness
really
good
body
and
feel
overall
its
very
very
good
a
slightly
sour
smoke
beer
unusual
challenging
but
fairly
rewarding
rendition
of
a
forgotten
style
worth
trying
for
sure
overall
i
suppose
i
could
lend
a
supportive
shrug
for
the
modest
alcohol
and
its
ease
of
drinkability
but
this
is
an
unimpressive
beer
thats
surprisingly
absent
in
the
flavor
department
o
a
lot
going
on
streuth
i
reckon
my
score
is
going
to
be
higher
than
the
average
as
im
quite
enjoying
this
brew
thats
never
happened
before
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
body
a
gratzers
supposed
to
have
though
it
seems
it
works
best
light
and
medium
might
be
pushing
it
but
could
still
work
this
one
borders
them
but
the
feel
is
thin
it
runs
pretty
smooth
but
only
has
a
little
crispness
to
it
it
goes
fairly
dry
and
just
a
very
gentle
tang
runs
on
the
tongue
from
the
sourness
taste
brings
a
considerably
stronger
ashysmokey
presence
than
did
the
aroma
acrid
like
black
coffee
whatever
that
subtly
sweet
note
on
the
nose
was
comes
in
the
back
end
here
to
give
it
a
crisp
fresh
feeling
dominated
by
the
charcoalashsmoke
i
really
enjoy
that
kind
of
amazing
that
its
only
4
5
as
well
it
seems
uncommon
for
brews
of
that
abv
to
have
this
level
of
flavour
and
heft
to
them
dont
know
why
that
would
be
but
it
seems
to
be
the
case
if
i
were
medieval
royalty
just
drinking
beer
all
day
instead
of
water
id
drink
this
overall3
75
as
a
proud
polish
immigrant
son
i
was
really
excited
to
see
a
polish
beer
style
i
didnt
know
existed
i
was
happy
with
the
beer
but
nonplussed
overall
good
black
malt
flavor
and
some
mellow
smoke
light
body
and
easily
drinkable
overall
this
beer
was
made
for
regional
tastes
and
big
pours
and
it
reflects
in
the
modern
american
brewing
landscape
of
one
offs
and
limited
batches
it
sadly
fails
to
impress
when
beer
geeks
expect
a
blast
of
this
or
that
as
an
overall
experience
it
was
basically
a
schwarzbier
with
a
touch
of
bacon
nowhere
near
a
rauchbier
maybe
if
there
was
a
line
between
schwarzbier
and
rauchbier
this
would
be
25
rauchbier
from
the
schwarzbier
side
if
you
released
this
in
the
80s
it
would
blow
minds
and
put
your
brewery
on
the
map
but
in
the
modern
age
of
wild
ales
and
13

it

the

in
this
was
pleasing
and
fit
well

liked

i

as

as
the

this

i
wish
there
were
more
of
this
style
out
there
damn
good
stuff
overall
relatively
mild
given
the
dark
color
and
smoke
but
still
full
flavored
interesting
while
easily
drinkable
ive
missed
this
one
a
few
times
at
a
few
local
places
so
it
was
serendipitous
that
id
find
it
here
at
tap
house
as
part
of
this
beastly
lips
of
faith
takeover
thing
that
and
svengoolie
love
it
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
sortakinda
murky
smoke
ash
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
well
ashen
foam
the
nose
comprises
oak
smoke
light
wood
clove
and
a
vague
sense
of
cracked
wheat
in
the
distance
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
smoke
taking
a
strong
lead
but
then
the
underlying
slightlysour
wheat
comes
in
near
and
through
the
finish
mixing
with
the
smoke
in
a
fairly
enjoyable
manner
its
never
fully
seamless
but
it
still
mostly
works
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
bit
of
wheaty
smoke
nuff
said
o
again
cant
speak
to
style
but
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
astringent
for
my
tastes
could
be
nice
paired
with
a
big
plate
of
ribs
slathered
with
a
sweet
bbq
sauce
or
with
a
fuller
bodied
sweeter
malt
bill
it
may
not
be
to
style
but
maybe
theres
a
reason
this
style
died
d
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
the
scent
and
taste
were
great
but
the
body
was
weak
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
the
beer
just
seemed
conflicted
should
be
heavier
or
lighter
than
it
was
fun
to
try
once
overall
as
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
this
one
is
wonderfully
unique
i
love
the
intense
smokiness
but
there
really
is
a
good
going
on
underneath
and
i
feel
the
characteristics
change
as
the
beer
warms
and
my
palate
adjusts
to
the
smoke
i
very
good
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
a
fan
smoke
overall
this
beer
gets
high
marks
from
me
because
its
the
perfect
amount
if
smoke
and
doesnt
overpower
very
easy
to
drink
pitch
black
pour
with
a
tan
onefinger
head
has
a
really
nice
aroma
of
coffee
beans
light
chocolate
and
smoke
the
taste
mostly
follows
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
coffee
bitterness
upfront
followed
by
a
smoky
taste
theres
a
light
sour
taste
at
the
end
overall
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
im
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
like
the
smoky
quality
and
also
the
lightness
not
sure
if
its
sessionable
because
it
has
some
pretty
strong
flavors
that
could
grow
tiresome
over
time
but
im
enjoying
this
as
much
or
more
than
i
was
expecting
to
overall
believe
it
or
not
this
is
our
first
taste
of
the
lips
of
faith
series
weve
been
under
new
belgiums
distribution
net
for
over
a
year
now
so
its
a
bit
embarrassing
as
many
a
good
release
has
come
out
between
now
and
way
back
when
to
make
matters
worse
this
is
our
first
grapple
with
a
grätzer
yes
yes
weve
had
plenty
of
smokes
and
rauchs
in
the
past
but
nothing
really
like
this
traditional
polish
style
the
thing
that
stands
out
most
about
this
one
is
how
dark
it
is
on
all
fronts
it
smells
like
your
elderly
pipepuffing
grandfathers
tweed
jacket
you
know
the
one
with
the
sewn
on
elbow
patches
the
flavoring
departs
from
this
a
bit
but
you
keep
that
same
aged
essence
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
is
new
belgium
about
this
and
what
is
three
floyds
but
whatever
each
contributes
here
it
works
the
smoke
stands
out
nicely
and
from
what
we
have
researched
they
stylistically
succeed
the
best
thing
again
is
probably
its
aroma
as
that
robustness
is
lost
a
bit
through
the
taste
but
either
way
we
would
certainly
buy
this
to
keep
us
warm
all
through
the
winter
but
am
i
wrong
smoky
barely
robust
hardly
the
sour
is
slight
though
ill
give
them
that
but
the
bitterness
does
not
bite
sometimes
poetics
when
used
gratuitously
betray
the
brew
im
gonna
cellar
the
other
bottles
i
bought
and
see
if
that
might
mellow
the
smoke
flavor
a
little
which
tends
to
be
overpowering
overall
a
good
attempt
but
fell
a
little
short
of
expectations
eager
to
see
how
aging
will
affect
it
3
35
to
the
drain
o
10
or
maybe
9
for
the
bomber
and
not
worth
it
in
my
opinion
sometimes
i
wish
collaborations
were
in
12
oz
bottles
just
not
a
style
that
you
really
want
22
oz
of
but
i
guess
one
to
share
in
the
disdain
i
had
to
help
some
people
move
they
lived
on
the
3rd
floor
of
a
house
and
they
had
a
ton
of
stuff
so
i
needed
a
lot
of
beer
went
for
this
over
the
only
other
beer
in
my
fridge
a
can
of
nomader
weisse
8
oz
are
going
to
make

this
is
actually
a
great

beer
with
the
lower
alcohol
and
dry
taste
plus
the
exuberant
sudsiness
from
the
22

at

in

prost
o
well
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
thinner
than
expected
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
robust
and
the
smoke
was
featured
a
little
more
in
the
main
flavors
the
other
flavors
arent
bad
i
just
want
a
little
more
smoke
from
a
smoked
beer

enjoyable

robust

only
the

beer
ive
had
of

just
needs
more

structure

before
so
i
really
cant
compare
this
brew
to
one

i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
would
like
to
try
it
again

this
is

i
would

ive
never

of
something
smoked
as
a
borderline
session
beer
but
this
works
im
curious
to
see
if
anyone
else
attempts
to
brew
this
style
overall
i
was
let
down
again
by
the
lof
i
wasnt
too
sure
about
this
beer
and
sure
enough
it
was
lackluster
overall
i
like
this
beer
ill
definitely
pick
up
another
bottle
and
pair
it
with
either
some
smokey
shrimp
street
tacos

maybe
even

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
much
different
than
other
beers
i
have
had
made
in
the

style
o
not
a
bad
smoked

a
little
light
in
flavor
seems
a
little
too
intensely
smoky
to
make
this
a
beer
for
regular
consumption
not
sure
in
the
home
country
would
be
that
smoky
could
not
really
tell
if
the

had
taken
hold

either
but
it
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
one
for
smoked

lovers
overall
a
pretty
good
twist
on
a
smoked
beer
good
smoke
and
oak
presence
with
a
nice
creamy
dark
malt
taste
overall
im
disappointed
i
paid
8
for
this
also
my
first
beer
from
fff
which
really
bummed
me
out
it
seems
like
every
lof
installment
lands
further
and
further
from
the
mark
this
being
no
exception
i
guess
at
least
i
can
make
a
cool
cup
out
of
the
bottle
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
opaque
in
glass
thick
dense
tan
foam
big
chunks
of
lace
down
the
glass
smell
portery
medium
roast
coffee
note
of
oak
smoke
milk
chocolate
black
plum
minimal
floral
hop
character
taste
roasty
and
snappy
smoked
grain
baking
chocolate
mildly
herbal
and
earthy
with
a
little
tart
stone
fruit
sweetness
theres
a
very
mild
acidic
bite
throughout
light
bodied
with
a
relaxed
but
fluffy
feel
really
quite
interesting
tasty
and
refreshing
gratzer
starts
with
decent
tan
foam
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
in
the
glass
the
liquid
is
an
opaque
black
liquid
that
definitely
matches
the
theme
well
on
the
nose
i
smell
sweet
smoked
barley
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
overpowered
with
so
much
smoke
it
is
nearly
undrinkable
for
me
the
mouth
feel
is
certainly
excellent
but
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
simple
on
the
nose
with
way
too
much
smoke
on
the
tongue
to
be
recommended
if
you
love
the
flavor
of
smoke
youll
be
in
love
otherwise
steer
clear
both
companies
have
better
options
pours
a
medium
brown
with
white
head
decent
retention
the
aroma
starts
with
heavy
smoked
malt
notes
of
campfire
burnt
wood
and
other
things
associated
with
smoke
come
to
mind
perhaps
a
bit
overdone
in
the
smoke
department
some
roast
comes
through
as
well
no
apparent
lacto
on
the
aroma
the
taste
starts
with
chocolate
and
smoke
started
like
a
smoke
forward
smoked
porter
not
too
bad
nothing
crazy
then
comes
a
hint
of
lactobacillus
which
just
makes
this
beer
weird
it
doesnt
really
come
across
as
being
tart
or
sour
just
that
implied
hint
of
sour
wheat
this
is
followed
by
some
lager
yeast
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
i
give
this
beer
props
for
being
unique
but
it
certainly
lacks
in
the
realm
of
balance
i
think
a
heavier
lacto
profile
and
a
bit
less
malt
would
have
really
made
for
an
interesting
beer
o
not
a
bad
offering
but
not
my
favorite
either
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
polish
beers
but
im
at
least
happy
i
gave
this
a
try
not
planning
on
buying
any
more
o
lots
of
flavor
for
a
sessionable
brew
wasnt
expecting
the
lacto
but
somehow
am
left
wanting
more
first
impressions
were
a
smoked
porter
first
sip
was
interesting
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
smoked
oak
is
very
present
throughout
hops
are
minimal
on
the
tongue
and
the
sour
note
is
more
prevalent
than
the
bottle
leads
you
to
believe
i
had
hoped
for
a
bigger
beer
overall
a
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
watery
and
moderately
carbonated
mild
hoppy
oily
bitter
finish
nothing
like
i
know
gratzers
to
be
lightly
smoked
wheat
based
beers
usually
fluffy
and
blonde
i
guess
it
isnt
written
in
the
rules
anywhere
that
it
cant
be
dark
wheat
malt
and
thats
exactly
whats
going
on
in
this
three
floyds
joint
effort
pours
like
a
ported
dark
dark
brown
barley
letting
light
pass
and
sporting
over
an
inch
of
tan
milkshake
textured
head
the
nose
on
it
is
only
subtly
smoky
not
as
intense
as
expected
but
the
malts
are
real
roasty
and
this
again
seems
more
like
a
robust
porter
than
a
gratzer
as
i
know
the
style
the
flavor
also
shows
only
a
little
smoke
its
there
all
the
way
through
but
it
isnt
the
main
flavor
agent
the
chewy
dark
grains
are
and
they
crowd
out
the
more
delicate
wheat
and
smoke
properties
i
was
looking
for
surprised
its
not
10
abv
given
the
involvement
of
three
floyds
on
this
thing
the
low
abv
makes
it
rather
drinkable
despite
being
a
confusing
experience
tough
to
call
this
one
a
true
gratzer
i
think
but
i
like
it
because
it
is
something
different
one
of
the
better
lips
of
faith
releases
in
awhile
but
dont
expect
anything
conventional
here

o
great
aroma
and
a
well
balanced
flavor
though
kinda
disappointed
it
only
packs
a

love
it
smoke
done
right
poured
out
as
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
retention
was
pretty
good
on
this
beer
with
a
minimal
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
smokey
aroma
to
it
with
just
some
hints
of
other
roasted
and
chocolate
aromas
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
wasnt
overly
smoked
which
to
me
is
a
good
thing
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
dryness
to
it
overall
its
not
a
bad
porter
it
is
also
drinkable
so
that
also
helps
this
beer
out
too
not
bad
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
smoke
and
roasted
coffee
in
the
taste
melow
smoke
and
a
nice
coffee
roast
note
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
hint
of
smoke
in
the
aftertaste
nice
mellow
smoke
presence
and
nice
small
presence
of
coffee
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
and
oily
off
white
head
forms
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lace
in
the
aroma
big
time
smokey
roasted
malt
essence
and
just
a
hint
of
smoke
cured
meat
in
the
flavor
a
pronounced
smoke
flavor
similar
to
german
rauchbier
some
chocolate
and
vanilla
are
there
roasted
malt
chimes
in
but
the
smoked
malt
flavor
is
predominant
finishes
with
a
lingering
smoke
note
an
authentic
american
rauchbier
in
my
mouth
this
beer
is
creamy
with
adaquate
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
just
a
touch
too
creamy
perhaps
for
a
porter
but
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
try
again
and
thats
saying
a
lot
for
this
nonsmoker
i
guess
maybe
one
puff
wasnt
enough
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
have
23
in
a
sitting
especially
on
a
cool
night
by
the
fire
good
creamy
cask
body
and
mouthfeel

as
it
warmed

pleasant
bbq
smoke
in

above

mouthfeel
a
sipper
but
drininkable
drying
finish
this
was
one
of
those
where
did
it
go
so
fast
beers
its
filled
with
so
much
smoky
goodness
that
its
hard
to
put
down
if
youre
a
fan
of
either
smoked
beers
or
a
creamy
cask
ale
and
youre
in
the
cleveland
area
then
stop
on
by
a
grab
a
pint
of
this
beer
notes
a
treat
to
have
on
cask
at
the
brewery
tonight
bravo
overall
a
good
drinking
experience
most
of
the
fatheads
beers
have
been
above
average
this
is
no
exception
seek
this
out
if
you
youre
interested
in
trying
the
style
or
if
you
love
the
smoked
beers
you
wont
be
disappointed

d
thin

though
tasting
smooth
the
overall
body
is
way
too
weak
to
be
enjoyable
made
worse
by
the
ending
sugary
flavour
the
palate
falls
short
of
the
promise
of
the
aroma
and
if
its
a
smoked
beer
its
a
quite
weak
one
as
no
substantial
peatiness

i
paid

quid
for
this

as
much
as
for

saved

in

for

wordpress
com
had
this
one
in
torino
italy
a
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
whiskey
and
vanilla
like
also
the
appearance
is
clear
red
with
a
nice
tan
head
which
stayed
for
a
while
on
the
glass
this
beer
tastes
sweet
sweet
in
a
strange
way
and
too
much
for
a
beer
i
dont
think
this
should
be
classed
as
a
beer
the
palate
taste
and
aftertaste
are
well
just
too
sweet
and
undrinkable
a
horrible
beer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
the
peat
smoking
grows
by
the
end
of
the
sip
while
it
is
expected
in
the
style
the
flavor
of
robust
smoke
is
always
interesting
when
introduced
to
the
palate
within
beer
and
to
this
it
did
not
disappoint
what
was
displeasing
however
was
how
overly
sweet
the
beer
was
and
how
any
cutting
bitterness
that
could
have
been
was
lost
among
it
to
summate
this
beer
tasted
like
a
toasted
marshmallow
that
fell
into
the
campfire
edible
but
interesting
finally
taste
far
from
extraordinary
slightly
watery
with
just
a
taste
a
little
smoky
which
is
still
a
highlight
for
a
rauchbier
it
also
collects
a
small
taste
safety
with
the
addition
of
sugar
and
dye
immondemment
and
unnecessarily
added
peaty
malt
whiskey
and
smoked
to
excess
is
touted
commercially
then
you
do
not
feel
almost
its
just
if
you
feel
the
beer
caramel
color
and
nose
in
the
same
way
except
that
it
does
not
come
from
a
caramel
malt
but
more
likely
a
dye
or
an
addition
so
certainly
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
taste
level
is
nothing

the

what
you
expect
given
the
above
ditto
finish
dont
want
any
more
of
this
actually
preferred
the
bottle
with
skunk
to
this
d
an
odd
beer
worth
trying
once
i
suppose
but
dont
search
too
hard
for
it
ddrinkable
but
not
overly
appealing
md
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
it
felt
sticky
but
was
smooth
and
the
carbonation
was
about
right
maybe
slightly
too
much
again
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
really
detracted
from
the
drinkability
it
could
really
be
more
like
an
after
dinner
drinkbeer
but
there
are
better
overall
not
a
bad
beer
might
be
only
a
bit
too
sweet
on
a
final
note
i
was
expecting
alot
more
peat
malt
character
and
wasnt
prepared
for
such
a
sweet
brew
i
was
also
a
bit
disappointed
regarding
the
bitterness
its
an
awkward
beer
but
i
was
expecting
worse
actually
wont
be
having
again
d
i
could
barely
finish
it
a
terrible
smell
but
an
interesting
flavor
not
anything
i
would
like
to
try
again
because
its
too
sweet
i
think
a
more
pronounced
oak
smokiness
and
less
sugary
fruit
flavor
would
make
this
one
a
decent
drink
as
it
is
now
this
one
should
be
avoided
i
almost
threw
the
beer
in
the
drain
adelscott
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
tried
and
i
hope
i
will
forget
its
dreadful
taste
as
soon
as
possible
drinkability
cette
bière

whisky
sans
plus
d
definitely
not
for
me
so
overly
smoky
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
although
i
can
say
i
appreciate
the
effort
to
make
something
unique
from
a
clear
bottle
thats
labeled
the
different
beer
this
one
pours
a
dull
amber
color
with
a
modest
but
solid
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
strange
theres
a
little
charcoal
carbonized
hickory
some
malt
and
a
bit
of
nearly
burned
sugar
a
little
faint
but
an
interesting
and
noteworthy
smell
the
taste
is
way
too
sweet
its
an
artificial
very
sugary
sweetness
that
didnt
do
anything
for
me
at
all
its
like
liquid
candy
theres
nothing
to
balance
the
sugar
and
it
was
simply
too
much
over
the
top
the
body
is
actually
a
bit
thin
its
an
interesting
brew
although
not
well
puttogether
its
worth
a
try
but
its
not
something
that
id
ever
grab
again

the

just
the
right

carbination
for
this
beer
a
good
smoked
beer
except
for
the
head
adelscott
sure
looks
like
scotch
with
a
crystal
clear
orangecopper
color
but
it
really
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
a
scotch
aroma
there
is
a
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
a
noticeable
peat
smoke
aftertaste
altogether
its
not
an
unpleasant
flavor
combination
but
it
is
a
little
odd
doubtless
the
people
at
fischer
felt
the
peatiness
needed
all
that
sugar
to
bring
things
back
into
balance
now
as
for
exact
taste
details
i
fortunately
remember
very
little
i
do
remember
however
coming
up
with
a
representation
that
could
perhaps
portray
the
horribleness
that
cost
me
6
euros
this
beer
tasted
as
if
one
took
a
run
of
the
mill
brown
aleon
the
malty
side
added
a
wee
bit
of
scotch
then
aged
it
in
some
french
bog
workers
old
boot
for
about
a
year
a
nice
pungent
leathery
taste
evened
out
with
sourness
one
would
expect
from
foot
bacteria
mmmm
if
you
see
this
brew
i
recommend
you
try
it
it
really
puts
beer
in
perspective
excuse
my
french
the
alsatian
brewery
fischer
tries
to
produce
foreign
beers
adelscott
is
a
beer
brewed
with
whisky
malt
but
made
in
strasbourg
france
desperados
is
a
tequila
flavored
beer
that
tries
to
sound
mexican
but
thats
produced
in
strasbourg
france
too
but
thats
a
different
story
the
soft
head
lasted
longer
than
i
expected
and
looked
actually
quite
nice
on
the
orange
color
body
the
smell
was
quite
interesting
very
malty
and
earthy
with
nice
notes
of
smoke
some
smoked
bacon
hmmm
some
pleasant
cow
dung
barn
notes
and
some
freshcut
grass
i
appreciated
the
taste
less
than
the
smell
still
malty
sweet
earthy
fresh
and
smoky
but
whereas
after
the
first
sip
youre
like
this
is
innovative
the
label
says
adelscott
the
different
beer
after
a
while
i
thought
this
is
getting
boring
my
pint
was
hard
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
round
and
a
bit
creamu
quite
smooth
but
a
bit
weak
close
to
being
watery
still
i
dont
regret
the
fact
that
i
bought
this
beer
i
am
very
glad
i
was
able
to
buy
a
single
of
this
one
and
as
it
was
i
only
took
2
sips
before
throwing
the
rest
out
the
first
was
to
taste
the
second
was
because
i
couldnt
believe
how
bad
it
tasted
if
i
had
to
sum
it
up
in
one
word
that
word
would
be
ghastly
the
ingredients
listed
are
water
malt
maize
whisky
malt
sugar
aromatic
compound
caramel
hops
ascorbic
acid
so
quite
a
bit
of
adjuncts
and
a
mysterious
sounding
aromatic
compound
this
is
probably
why
it
has
that
artificial
aftertaste
50cl
can
an
amberbrown
color
with
a
bit
of
a
head
what
is
that
smell
god
was
it
fairly
sweet
there
was
a
muskiness
to
it
also
kind
of
like
ripe
old
socks
i
really
wasnt
sure
what
the
taste
is
i
dont
think
they
put
bad
whiskey
in
there
or
did
they
i
thought
that
maybe
they
used
a
different
barley
malt
that
would
have
made
it
into
scotch
but
i
cant
figure
out
what
they
did
hopefully
they
wont
do
it
much
longer
i
kind
of
wondered
what
kind
of
beer
this
was
as
the
label
was
in
french
i
guess
whisky
means
the
same
thing
in
both
languages
clear
pale
brown
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
perplexing
mixture
of
smoke
alcohol
and
sweet
caramel
the
flavor
can
best
be
described
as
charred
malt
and
bile
i
could
barely
get
down
a
mouthful
of
this
stuff
maybe
the
clear
bottle
is
to
blame
or
maybe
this
is
just
a
horrid
beer
the
finish
is
nasty
and
had
me
burping
smoke
flavor
the
rest
of
the
evening
truly
an
awful
experience
little
to
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
rather
sweet
which
reminds
me
of
a
a
belgian
of
course
this
also
reminds
of
islay
darkest
caramel
is
present
as
is
the
alcohol
dark
toned
slight
malty
nose
rather
provocative
the
taste
as
ive
said
is
nice
and
the
finishing
bitterness
slight
but
adequately
proportionate
to
the
abundance
of
taste
ok
to
try
an
excellent
smoke
beer
brewed
with
peat
malt
this
stuff
is
a
dark
amber
in
colour
with
no
head
to
be
found
the
aromas
are
all
smoke
heavy
malts
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
smoky
and
malty
with
no
booze
to
be
found
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
and
the
drinkability
is
not
the
best
medium
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
very
different
from
your
average
beer
and
certainly
not
for
everybody
i
liked
it
though
one
of
the
most
unusual
odd
brews
around
peat
smoked
whiskey
malt
gives
this
beer
a
hint
of
a
single
malt
foggy
amberbrown
in
color
with
a
full
body
medium
hops
are
hidden
in
the
smoke
smoky
in
aroma
a
rapidly
dissipating
head
leaves
a
trace
of
lace
akin
to
licking
the
inside
of
a
chimney
but
in
a
good
way
roll
the
bottle
gently
before
opening
to
dislodge
any
bit
and
particles
if
you
dare
i
usually
dont
like
sweet
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
this
beer
is
very
sweet
made
from
a
form
of
peat
malt
almost
slimey
mouthfeel
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
bottle
will
sample
again
when
i
get
the
chance
o
not
a
fan
of
smoked
ales
but
at
least
this
didnt
taste
of
ashtray
like
some
do
o
the
full
smoke
flavor
is
all
bandaids
with
no
malt
support
or
other
character
to
give
it
some
depth
or
taste
it
was
too
harsh
to
finish
one
more
idea
this
beer
might
make
an
interesting
mixer
maybe
with
bourbon
the
smokeyness
might
work
well
there
but
by
itself
next
time
i
will
pass
o
one
and
done
not
bad
but
nothing
id
search
for
again
this
was
an
8
99
6pack
mistake
i
did
not
make
it
through
my
first
bottle
my
son
in
law
could
not
tolerate
the
deep
surrey
of
wet
ashes
smell
either
note
i
do
not
have
a
lot
of
smoked
beers
to
compare
this
to
but
i
assume
it
is
average
i
really
have
a
hard
time
getting
past
the
smoke
flavor
though
i
personally
do
not
care
for
this
at
all
but
was
trying
to
rate
for
the
category
if
you
can
drink
liquid
smoke
then
this
is
the
stuff
i
even
use
smoking
chips
when
grilling
pizza
and
this
was
a
drain
pour
after
1
sip
i
always
give
things
a
couple
sips
or
bites
if
it
is
food
but
it
was
not
possible
pure
smoke
nothing
else
i
even
tried
to
return
it
and
just
left
the
other
5
on
the
counter
at
the
store
it
was
so
overpowering
needs
a
warning
label
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
amber
with
loose
head
aroma
is
smokey
and
bready
malt
toast
i
suppose
smoke
dominates
the
taste
with
meaty
flavors
mouthfeel
is
pretty
harsh
campfire
smokey
on
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
okay
but
not
something
i
would
look
for
again
an
alright
smoked
ale
some
more
malt
depth
wouldve
really
helped
this
worth
a
try
dark
amber
small
head
of
white
foam
low
carbonation
which
works
well
in
smoked
beers
in
my
opinion
porky
smoky
throughout
really
its
all
about
the
smoke
smooth
with
a
nice
backdrop
of
caramel
and
bread
crust
what
else
can
i
say
its
got
a
luscious
open
fire
smokiness
that
carries
the
beer
but
is
not
overdone
would
certainly
hit
the
mark
with
some
smoked
brisket
or
pork
shoulder
a
damn
nice
smoked
beer
o
quite
an
excellent
example
of
rauchbier
nice
smokey
layers
mingling
with
malts
and
hops
a
good
session
beer
too
strongly
for
anyone
looking
for
a
rauchbier
at
a
moderate
price
point
will
definitely
buy
this
again
overall
infused
with
only
a
mild
blithe
smokiness
it
may
work
well
enough
as
an
introductory
smoke
ale
probably
a
good
gateway
smoked
brew
keep
this
one
in
your
back
pocket
for
a
nice
chilly
fall
evening
not
terrible
but
certainly
not
exceptional
a
nice
try
at
a
smoked
beer
but
just
an
average
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
amber
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
hint
of
roasted
malt
slight
pale
malt
and
slight
smoke
fits
the
style
of
a
smoke
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
strong
smoke
slight
pale
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
grain
overall
good
appearance
and
very
drinkable
d
this
beer
didnt
really
do
much
for
me
as
far
as
a
smoked
beer
would
go
it
did
have
enough
flavor
and
not
so
much
off
flavor
that
i
could
drink
many
of
these
if
it
was
priced
a
little
lower
than
what
i
saw
on
the
6pk
carrier
at
vinces
i
would
pick
it
up
deep
scarlet
red
with
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
that
shrinks
to
a
skim
smoky
bacon
and
hickory
notes
in
the
aroma
whats
not
to
love
smoked
pork
chops
bacon
and
ham
all
come
to
mind
with
the
smoky
sweet
malt
flavors
the
underlying
beer
flavors
are
nice
and
are
not
overpowered
by
smoke
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
not
as
smoky
as
a
rauchbier
but
in
the
neighborhood
good
stuff
overall
a
wellbalanced
imperial
stout
the
smoke
here
is
quite
mild
and
just
lingers
in
the
background
compared
to
some
smoked
beersrauchbiers
a
nice
wintertime
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
grilled
pork
or
beef
sausage
mushroom
dishes
and
caramel
nut
chocolate
deserts
everything
about
this
beer
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
improve
as
it
warms
a
bit
after
coming
out
of
the
refrigerator
packing
some
power
and
very
filling
this
is
a
brew
to
be
reckoned
with
however
it
is
not
overpowering
and
is
quite
well
done
the
smoky
flavor
does
nothing
to
detract
from
the
solid
malty
taste
faint
hop
presence
very
good
my
first
experience
with
smoked
porter
and
i
rather
enjoyed
it
faint
smoke
and
sweet
vanilla
on
the
nose
after
a
rich
molasses
pour
two
finger
caramel
colored
head
leaves
behind
a
thin
layer
of
foam
and
some
lacing
throughout
the
drink
taste
is
big
and
bold
not
overly
complex
with
a
nice
punch
at
10
a
hearty
brew
the
smoke
is
most
evident
to
me
as
an
aftertaste
more
like
that
of
a
cigar
than
a
smoked
food
perhaps
not
bitter
and
no
other
real
aftertaste
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
the
power
and
a
bit
of
an
experience
i
like
it
aroma
is
not
overly
smoky
mainly
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
nice
dark
color
with
beige
head
almost
like
a
cola
the
flavour
is
where
the
smokiness
sneaks
in
but
is
balanced
quite
well
by
sweet
malts
and
chocolate
not
hoppy
at
all
if
you
enjoy
dark
porters
or
any
smoked
beers
you
should
enjoy
this
one
pours
a
deep
chocolate
brown
with
a
creamy
beige
head
atop
aromas
are
not
overly
smoky
but
its
theremainly
dark

and
brown

detected
the
raisindark
fruit
flavors
are
the
main
component
on
the
flavor
profile
as
wellmild
smoke
and
chocolate
round
out
the

along
with
sweet
alcohol
a
pretty
solid
beer

not

full

and

as
a
once
avid
homebrewer
id
probably
revamp
the
recipe
with
slightly
less
fermentables
to
yield
just
a
touch
lower
alcohol
and
bring
out
a
wonderful
maltiness
that
is
somewhat
masked
for
me
that
would
be
the
difference
between
a
3
5
beer
and
a
4
5
beer
still
a
wonderful
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
its
my
first
smoked
porter
so
i
was
expecting
more
smoke
but
regardless
of
what
this
one
is
called
it
was
quite
enjoyable
o
not
sure
if
id
get
it
again
appreciate
the
mendocino
but
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
particular
brew
o
this
is
a
tasty
porter
but
i
have
no
idea
how
its
called
a
smoked
beer
i
was
expecting
those
smoky
meaty
peat
flavors
but
this
was
actually
quite
sweet
its
a
good
beer
but
not
what
you
want
if
youre
looking
for
a
smoky
beer
a
decent
enough
porter
smokey
roasted
malt
flavors
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
aroma
and
flavor
but
then
again
this
is
10
o
solid
drinks
way
too
fast
for
a
beer
thats
10
abv
im
not
really
caring
for
this
too
much
the
smoke
actually
clutters
up
the
beer
and
detracts
from
it
and
doesnt
sit
well
with
the
herbaceous
green
leafy
hops
and
bitterness
if
they
took
out
the
smoked
malt
and
dialed
down
the
bittering
hops
and
removed
any
later
additions
youd
have
yourself
a
decent
baltic
porter
22

is
a
very
recent
release

fairly

would
imagine
this
is

sipped
slowly
to
absorb

of

expected
at
all
very
nice
session
brew
how
delightful
this
smoked
wheat
brew
from
white
birch
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
their
berliner
but
just
as
creative
i
love
this
its
a
pale
orange
color
not
a
ton
of
head
or
carbonation
but
such
a
light
body
it
really
doesnt
miss
it
sessionable
flavorful
beer
is
in
and
this
is
one
of
a
kind
also
superior
to
other
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
a
medium
smoke
on
the
nose
cherrywood
malt
maybe
some
more
heavy
rauch
type
stuff
but
in
small
doses
the
wheat
is
fresh
and
well
modified
the
beer
is
dry
refreshing
i
liked
this
as
a
companion
to
spicy
grilled
sausage
the
lightness
cut
the
spice
while
the
two
smoke
profiles
played
off
one
another
very
well
improving
the
overall
experience
of
both
light
enough
to
drink
a
ton
of
flavorful
enough
not
to
get
bored
and
very
nicely
reserved
on
the
smoke
it
isnt
over
done
at
all
one
of
those
beers
i
wish
was
available
not
that
i
would
drink
it
everyday
but
the
colorado
market
really
has
no
substitute
for
something
like
this
and
with
our
penchant
as
a
state
for
grilling
and
drinking
we
need
a
beer
like
this
stoked
for
claystation
to
have
shared
his
only
bottle
with
me
overall
this
has
been
sitting
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
because
a
smoked
wheat
3
8
beer
without
crackling
reviews
just
seemed
a
long
shot
very
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
will
have
it
again
with
rich
live
goodies
in
the
bottle
bottom
unique
delicious
and
fun
poured
a
cloudy
orange
body
with
fluffy
head
and
a
smokey
and
spicy
aroma
that
gives
off
some
citriclemon
and
pepper
bite
and
a
little
bit
of
meatiness
that
one
expects
with
a
smoke
beer
thin
bodied
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
the
sharp
wit
notes
of
citric
bitterness
and
spice
come
through
as
does
a
very
noticeable
smoked
edge
and
the
two
flavor
profiles
balance
with
each
other
to
create
a
good
beer
without
one
dominant
personality
however
the
charateristics
of
the
beer
do
not
stand
out
too
much
and
there
really
isnt
anything
to
this
beer
that
i
could
say
is
great
or
would
recommend
to
someone
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
worty
effort
but
not
my
favorite
the
beer
pours
a
murky
caramel
orange
with
a
fizzy
head
on
top
that
sizzles
away
to
nothing
but
a
scrim
in
body
the
beer
is
dark
and
murky
but
clean
of
particles
giving
the
beer
a
cloudy
amber
hue
on
the
nose
this
beer
is
all
about
the
smoked
malts
big
woodsy
and
sweet
with
notes
of
wood
smoked
bacon
and
pork
there
is
a
creaminess
to
the
smell
that
blends
beautifully
with
the
smoke
and
accentuates
it
suggesting
light
butter
and
very
light
caramel
malt
the
smell
is
rich
and
smoky
and
though
it
is
a
little
onenoted
with
the
smoke
there
is
ample
complexity
within
the
smoke
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
richly
smoky
sweet
with
a
light
acidic
pop
meaty
salt
notes
also
swim
over
the
tongue
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
with
a
huge
burst
of
smoky
beechwood
bacon
and
smoked
pork
this
beer
then
takes
towards
bright
citrus
almost
like
lemon
juice
caramel
malts
like
what
you
would
find
in
a
malty
amber
ale
do
appear
on
the
tongue
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
but
are
then
blended
with
spicy
hop
note
and
then
the
smoke
returns
in
the
finish
giving
lovely
woody
notes
alongside
the
richer
meaty
notes
the
end
of
the
finish
is
a
little
weak
and
watery
finally
showing
the
beers
3
8
but
up
until
that
point
i
could
not
have
guessed
the
beers
weak
abv
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
chary
and
metallic
but
is
mostly
the
nice
smoked
malt
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
in
body
yet
slightly
chewy
in
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
fierce
and
scrubbing
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
lots
of
the
beer
but
is
a
little
too
fierce
for
my
taste
overall
this
is
a
weird
and
unique
beer
the
smoked
malts
are
rich
and
tasty
and
pack
a
ton
of
flavor
into
this
little
beer
and
the
caramel
malt
provides
a
light
secondary
flavor
the
finish
is
watery
however
which
might
be
due
to
the
style
and
definitely
makes
this
beer
drinkable
in
large
quantities
but
leaves
me
wanting
a
little
more
weight
in
my
mouth
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
am
excited
to
see
the
style
revived
loads
of
smoke
and
a
very
big
flavored
beer
for
such
a
small
abv
recommended
if
you
like
a
really
smokey
beer
this
is
my
first
beer
from
white
birch
as
well
as
my
first
grodziskie
and
i
have
to
say
i
couldnt
be
happier
i
love
smoked
beers
so
when
i
saw
we
got
this
at
my
local
shop
i
had
to
pick
it
up
for
6bomber
too
how
could
i
go
wrong
big
kudos
to
white
birch
this
was
exactly
what
i
needed
tonight
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
forward
that
the
invitational
aroma
with
a
much
more
full
wheat
and
smoke
flavor
and
a
low
but
mellow
bitterness
at
the
end
i
could
drink
this
style
a
hundred
times
and
white
birch
really
pulls
it
off
wonderfully
its
a
3
8
abv
beer
but
it
feels
heavier
than
that
pours
a
hazy
medium
to
deep
golden
color
with
a
small
but
long
lasting
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
smoky
campfire
with
a
spicy
edge
to
it
and
sweet
lightly
fruity
malt
backbone
hidden
deep
under
the
smoldering
embers
the
flavor
is
smoked
meat
up
front
with
a
solid
shot
of
earthy
hop
bite
to
it
sweet
and
spicy
malts
play
together
midway
through
before
leaving
a
smokey
almost
tart
fruit
finish
the
charred
wood
lingers
on
my
salivating
palette
long
after
each
sip
light
to
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
smokey
sticky
phenolic
mouthfeel
this
is
definitely
different
but
i
enjoyed
the
hell
of
this
beer
light
and
smokey
with
light
fruitiness
it
works
for
me
o
really
happy
i
picked
this
up
one
of
the
better
simple
malt
brews
must
warn
all
that
this
is
smoky
delicious
but
you
need
to
like
some
smokiness
or
you
may
not
be
a
fan
however
this
might
be
a
one
time
thing
for
me
as
an
ipa
guy
overall
a
decent
porter
that
has
plenty
of
potential
if
you
want
to
make
the
double
part
of
the
label
more
fitting
fill
out
the
body
and
ramp
up
the
addition
of
the
smoked
malt
that
aspect
was
so
promising
in
the
nose
but
didnt
fill
out
in
everything
that
followed
not
a
bad
porter
by
any
stretch
and
the
smoky
whisky
aspect
was
well
done
but
needs
a
bit
of
work
to
become
something
id
regularly
seek
out
overall
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
remember
it
though
that
just
might
be
because
ive
had
the
chance
to
try
much
more
of
their
stuff
and
now
see
how
good
these
guys
really
are
a
quality
beer
for
sure
but
this
is
very
similar
to
their
fumee
kind
of
like
a
fumee
lite
many
of
the
same
qualities
are
here
but
the
smoke
is
toned
down
slightly
an
enjoyable
beer
but
given
how
excellent
the
rest
of
their
stuff
is
this
one
doesnt
quite
run
in
the
same
crowd
overall
smokey
porter
here
but
not
sure
if
id
call
it
a
double
nice
beer
in
any
case
overall
pretty
good
enjoyed
the
bottle
o
announced
as
a
robust
porter
this
beers
doesnt
share
much
of
the
characteristics
of
a
porter
it
certainly
lacks
a
smoother
mouthfeel
besides
the
smoky
character
is
too
dominant
and
hides
all
the
malty
notes
which
might
be
present
im
rather
disappointed
by
the
beer
from
brasseurs
illimités
ashy
smokey
yeasty
flavors
dominate
very
dry
this
beer
exemplifies
everything
i
dislike
about
porters
and
smoked
beers
lets
see
if
the
drain
rejects
it
as
strongly
as
my
palate
did
o
i
feel
like
this
beerwhile
very
goodjust
missed
being
a
great
brew
just
a
bit
to
tame
for
something
that
wants
to
have
an
intense
bacon
feel
to
it
not
my
cuppa
for
sure
o
unpleasant
would
not
buy
this
again
overall
a
great
fall
seasonal
that
fits
with
cold
weather
and
offers
something
different
great
smoked
double
porter
od
i
have
trouble
with
smoked
beers
but
this
is
ok
not
the
best
and
i
dont
really
enjoy
it
a
whole
lot
but
its
smooth
and
seems
technically
good
just
not
my
style
would
go
great
with
some
bbqd
meat
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
simple
malt
d
quite
easytodrink
although
the
smokiness
would
limit
my
evening
to
maybe
one
or
two
of
these
overall
very
decent
and
tasty
overall
im
very
impressed
moreso
than
i
expected
quebec
is
without
a
doubt
producing
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
and
to
me
this
brewery
is
really
making
a
run
for
one
of
the
best
in
quebec
bonne
journe
drink
there
was
something
slightly
off
with
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
was
still
fairly
decent
im
not
sure
i
would
drink
more
than
1
at
a
sitting
its
still
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
d
good
but
smoke
would
get
old
maybe
two
bye
bottle
purchased
yesterday
from
peluso
in
montreal
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
hints
of
amber
thick
offwhite
head
leaves
traces
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
the
promised
smoke
nice
roasted
bitterness
in
the
flavour
with
the
smoke
coming
through
more
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
since
it
is
called
a
double
porter
but
still
nice
to
drink
another
great
beer
from
this
brewery
pleasant
porter
thats
nicely
drinkable
pours
very
dark
brown
chocolate
colour
not
much
head
and
maybe
affected
by
a
few
months
cellaring
in
that
regard
a
little
roasty
and
whiff
of
smoke
nice
with
barbeque
meal
mouthfeel
middling
and
it
was
smooth
creamy
although
i
expected
this
to
be
thicker
for
the
declared
porter
style
not
significantly
smokey
but
its
there
d
definitely
one
of
my
favourite
smoky
beers
to
drink
especially
pairing
it
up
with
smoked
gouda
cheese
and
olive
bread
a
bit
thicker
body
would
make
it
better
but
no
complaints
here
pours
a
moderately
deep
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
right
off
the
bat
the
nose
is
intensely
smoky
charred
wood
and
flames
mixed
with
highly
roasted
malt
as
well
as
faint
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
the
taste
levels
the
playing
field
a
bit
with
the
roast
and
smoke
aspects
of
the
beer
combining
pretty
well
medium
body
with
some
dryness
and
good
carbonation
for
what
its
offering
drinks
pretty
well
for
how
overpowering
the
nose
would
make
it
seem
all
in
all
a
good
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
almost
no
foam
except
for
a
small
layer
of
swamp
colored
bubbles
this
beer
has
beautiful
aromas
and
flavors
smells
big
on
smoked
ham
and
gamey
meats
with
espresso
and
roastiness
slightly
less
apparent
than
the
smokiness
flavors
are
big
and
smoky
reminiscent
of
burnt
sausages
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
hoped
this
wouldnt
be
a
smokedrenched
disaster
and
its
not
it
has
subtlety
and
depth
of
character
and
most
importantly
of
all
a
comforting
flavor
profile
makes
me
wish
this
was
bomber
size
as
this
is
about
as
drinkable
as
an
overtly
smokey
beer
can
get
d
my
favourite
smoked
beer
my
far
its
a
nice
combination
of
porter
and
smoke
making
it
easier
to
drink
and
more
pleasurable
texture
was
a
bit
thin
but
none
the
less
a
great
beer
from
qc
thanks
again
zorprime
f
medium
body
nice
bite
from
the
alcohol
and
the
smoke
lingers
good
drinkability
well
balanced
and
tasty
tasty
and
very
smoky
overall
overall
its
a
decent
beer
very
woodsearthy
smelling
and
tasting
not
bad
but
not
something
id
order
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
is
good
if
smoked
beers
suit
you
as
they
do
me
theres
just
a
bit
more
than
one
thing
going
on
here
but
not
a
lot
more
still
i
like
it
deep
dark
brown
with
maybe
some
mahogany
highlights
tan
head
holds
for
a
bit
and
then
diminishes
to
a
collar
nose
is
fireplace
maple
and
savory
with
a
touch
of
roasty
a
touch
of
chocolate
a
hint
of
coffee
and
an
ever
so
slight
hop
presence
in
the
mix
taste
carries
a
very
good
balance
with
the
malt
that
has
been
twice
smoked
once
over
peat
wood
and
once
over
ash
wood
taking
the
main
role
the
other
flavors
dance
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
shows
off
what
the
whiskey
malt
does
leaving
a
dry
woodsiness
as
it
goes
was
expecting
more
body
and
a
little
more
chocolatecoffeeplain
old
porter
taste
sort
of
one
dimensional
making
it
hard
to
drink
too
many
but
still
a
fun
taste
of
smoke
way
overpriced
here
in
the
states
as
well
not
delicious
but
solid
i
would
drink
more
of
this
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
good
smokey
character
a
tasty
smoked
porter
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
nicely
smoky
not
overdone
well
balance
and
easy
drinking
nothing
too
offensive
nothing
too
interesting
a
runofthemill
porter
with
a
decent
smokiness
it
would
serve
as
a
good
introduction
to
smoked
beers
for
someone
new
to
the
style
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
after
trying
their
imperial
stout
is
seems
that
one
is
the
star
of
the
bunch
so
far
none
of
the
others
have
matched
its
quality
the
lightness
of
this
beer
does
make
it
pretty
drinkable
but
theres
just
not
enough
flavour
coming
through
i
think
this
brew
could
be
easily
steppedup
to
a
great
porter
with
some
minor
tinkering
on
the
right
track
but
not
quite
there
overall
i
never
connected
with
the
calumet
calumet
grand
chef
and
this
one
which
is
basically
the
same
recipe
is
no
different
i
found
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
and
the
body
was
lacking
still
good
but
not
very
good
bottle
via
glouglouburp
pours
a
dark
cola
with
a
slight
red
hue
minimal
head
and
lacing
nose
sweet
and
smokey
with
a
mineral
saltiness
taste
chalky
with
a
dry
smokey
roast
flavour
slight
bandaid
flavour
on
the
finish
medium
to
light
bodied
with
robust
carbonation
p
s
should
be
categorized
as
a
smoked
porter
bièreopholie
which
was
the
old
name
of
simple
malt
usually
was
only
doing
their
porters
smoked
i
think
they
kept
the
same
recipe
as
the
calumet
which
was
a
smoked
porter
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
a
bit
onedimensional
d
a
good
porter
but
it
is
outdone
by
a
number
of
others
i
think
this
should
be
categorized
as
a
smoked
porter
bottle
poured
a
clear
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
smoked
is
quite
dominant
with
some
notes
of
roasted
malt
also
noticeable
taste
is
dominated
by
a
nice
mix
of
smoked
malt
with
a
little
touch
of
roasted
malt
body
is
bit
thin
and
beer
would
be
better
with
a
fuller
body
with
good
carbonation
very
well
done
with
loads
of
smoked
malt
but
i
think
this
beer
would
be
even
better
with
more
roasted
malt
and
a
fuller
creamier
body
the
beer
is
brown
color
more
like
a
dark
brown
than
a
light
black
the
head
is
made
of
big
bubbles
and
disappear
quite
fast
to
leave
only
a
thin
film
of
fine
bubbles
the
aroma
is
smoky
with
some
roast
and
something
else
the
label
says
it
has
some
whiskey
touch
it
is
probably
that
the
taste
is
roastsmoke
nice
a
good
bitterness
at
the
end
it
starts
slow
and
finish
high
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
smoke
is
taking
more
place
in
the
taste
medium
body
this
is
a
very
good
session
porter
a
porter
that
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
not
as
enjoyable
when
picked
apart
as
it
seems
a
bit
onedimensional
on
the
surface
yet
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
double
porter
and
salute
the
spirit
of
bieropholie
that
lives
on
through
this
a
huge
thanks
to
goldorak
for
bringing
me
a
bottle
of
this
to
alberta
to
sample
at
2015
suwanee
craft
beer
fest
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
amber
hues
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
unusual
some
smoke
taste
is
smokey
wood
meats
a
good
bit
of
band
aide
flavor
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
a
unique
beer
to
try
but
one
i
wont
need
to
drink
again
i
dont
know
about
this
beer
i
have
had
one
bottle
of
this
and
dont
know
if
its
just
an
infected
batch
i
got
but
i
get
a
lot
of
funky
smell
and
taste
from
it
tastes
like
it
has
lacto
bacteria
in
it
to
me
i
have
had
some
smoked
beers
before
but
this
flavor
is
not
the
smoked
variety
to
me
its
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
overall
great
brew
i
would
have
this
one
again
for
sure
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
hived
its
wheat
base
but
you
really
need
to
have
grown
accustomed
to
the
bandaid
aromas
and
flavors
to
appreciate
it
intriguing
combo
of
smoke
style
i
feel
like
this
has
potential
but
not
fully
executed
rjt
overall
this
was
o
k
this
was
quite
malty
and
left
a
slightly
sticky
residue
behind
in
my
mouth
the
alcohol
was
light
enough
that
i
could
have
had
seconds
of
this
in
one
sitting
but
like
most
people
i
felt
that
one
at
a
time
was
enough
while
this
wont
bowl
anyone
over
its
different
than
anything
else
on
the
shelf
and
is
worth
a
go
once
if
for
no
other
reason
that
in
its
own
odd
way
this
was
a
meal
all
unto
itself
yes
it
called
for
a
food
pairing
but
there
was
enough
here
to
give
it
complexity
to
go
with
the
oddity
that
a
smoked
beer
was
and
still
is
for
someone
like
me
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
offwhite
head
low
retention
on
a
clear
copper
body
aroma
includes
caramel
sweetness
some
butterscotch
and
maybe
a
slight
hint
of
smoke
taste
showcases
the
smoke
much
more
than
the
aroma
again
some
caramel
sweetness
and
some
of
the
wheat
flavors
shine
through
interesting
mix
of
flavors
not
bad
at
all
o
kinda
ok
nothing
special
o
overall
interesting
but
not
something
i
am
in
love
with
the
smoke
feels
a
touch
sweet
and
it
seems
like
after
the
smoke
there
isnt
much
else
to
it
not
bad
just
not
interesting
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
terribly
complex
pours
dark
copper
with
an
abundant
off
white
head
that
dissipates
leaving
little
lacing
along
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
smelled
smoky
during
the
pour
that
smokiness
is
pretty
strong
in
the
aroma
but
i
can
also
pick
up
the
sweetness
as
well
the
taste
is
smoky
the
malt
sweetness
does
come
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
its
a
pretty
difficult
flavor
to
describe
its
slightly
astringent
and
acrid
i
enjoy
it
more
as
i
drink
it
the
body
is
light
to
medium
there
isnt
much
carbonation
to
speak
of
overall
this
beer
is
interesting
unfortunately
it
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
its
interesting
in
the
average
sense
im
sure
it
would
pair
well
with
the
local
cuisine
but
i
wont
be
rushing
to
the
store
for
another
bottle
of
this
any
time
soon
after
reading
the
description
i
thought
id
hate
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
least
at
first
the
overall
texture
is
on
the
thick
side
of
mediumbodied
with
a
lasting
astringent
quality
not
a
bad
beer
but
im
not
crazy
about
it
o
an
intriguing
beer
but
not
altogether
an
obviously
good
one
still
i
liked
it
despite
the
misleading
moniker
tentatively
recommended
gotta
love
the
random
smoked
tick
eh
it
pours
a
tawny
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
toffee
and
hickory
smoke
with
only
a
twinge
of
woody
greens
in
the
middleground
between
them
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
hickory
smoke
husky
wheat
light
clove
and
toasted
caramel
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
oilyish
feel
overall
a
generally
enjoyable
smoked
beer
but
one
that
really
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
others
in
any
real
way
tasty
though
the
smoke
flavor
was
all
but
nonexistent
when
i
drank
it
the
beer
has
a
sour
taste
initial
and
afterward
that
i
didnt
find
too
offputting
but
rather
refreshing
lemon
zest
and
tart
cherries
decent
and
interesting
but
i
wont
be
hunting
it
down
and
hoarding
all
bottles
i
got
a
brief
finger
of
tawny
head
from
my
pour
but
it
disappeared
like
it
had
something
better
to
do
color
was
a
lightly
hazy
orangishamber
nose
was
quite
smoky
overlaying
a
slight
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
while
it
was
smoky
in
the
mouth
it
was
nowhere
near
as
overpowering
as
some
made
it
out
to
be
finish
was
likewise
smokysweet
kind
of
like
some
types
of
barbecue
that
i
have
had
in
my
travels
it
was
not
bad
but
it
was
not
earthshattering
either
enjoy
oooo
yehhh
o
the
bayou
teche
pale
is
pretty
phenomenal
and
id
hoped
for
something
similar
from
this
as
such
its
a
fairly
benign
beer
hinting
at
smokiness
and
malt
sweetness
but
without
a
great
deal
of
body
its
just
ok
and
that
equals
disappointing
to
me
drinkable
but
certainly
not
craveworthy
sessionable
strength
is
very
nice
however
id
bet
this
compliments
spicy
foods
well
o
not
a
bad
smoke
beer
when
ever
i
get
one
i
try
to
pair
it
with
bbq
chicken
o
interesting
concept
but
it
was
too
one
dimensional
smoke
got
in
the
way
of
any
small
flavors
that
could
have
been
in
there
glad
i
got
to
try
but
would
pass
on
this
again
overall
its
not
bad
at
all
light
for
a
smoked
beer
but
very
drinkable
overall
i
say
this
to
myself
with
each
smoked
beer
i
tryi
just
cant
seem
to
get
intoappreciate
this
style
this
one
was
a
bit
easier
for
me
to
handle
since
it
was
a
lighter
style
beer
but
i
still
cant
seem
to
enjoy
it
o
overall
i
scored
it
average
because
its
a
really
cool
beer
but
it
could
be
better
o
not
an
overpowering
smoked
beer
a
good
entry
from
bayou
teche
maximize
with
a
burger
or
cheddar
drinkability
easy
to
knock
back
if
it
wasnt
for
the
not
so
appealing
smelltaste
so
they
bottled
this
beer
and
i
can
review
it
in
the
comfort
my
own
home
so
what
i
got
is
a
yellow
to
orange
color
i
definitely
smelled
smoke
but
not
the
wood
smoke
i
actually
wanted
it
just
lacks
the
gameness
i
get
out
of
most
smoke
beers
the
head
dissipated
as
fast
i
poured
it
the
taste
was
very
light
smoke
with
a
slight
wheat
fruitiness
overall
it
was
a
average
to
good
beer
that
i
wouldnt
care
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
o
not
really
impressed
though
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
when
i
see
bottles
around
hopefully
the
smokiness
is
more
pronounced
and
the
wheat
characters
are
more
noticeable
im
not
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
especially
porters
or
wheat
beers
but
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
quite
different
than
my
expectations
appearance
was
a
slight
golden
color
with
an
small
head
smell
was
malty
wheat
with
a
bare
hint
of
smoke
taste
was
slightly
sweet
malty
and
smokey
the
smoke
taste
didnt
overwhelm
and
was
quite
agreeable
the
malts
and
hops
were
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
dry
overall
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
i
would
consider
for
regular
rotation
i
just
hope
it
will
soon
be
available
in
a
bottle
overall
certainly
is
the
best
smoked
beer
ive
had
as
the
smoke
is
masterfully
woven
into
the
rest
of
the
beer
its
still
a
smoked
beer
though
had
on
tap
at
prohibition
pig
and
blackback
i
always
feel
bad
deducting
points
for
a
style
im
not
crazy
about
i
like
smoke
dont
love
it
and
had
it
up
against
a
few
other
hf
brews
was
still
pretty
amazing
just
felt
like
the
smoke
was
out
of
place
more
like
an
experiment
and
yet
still
about
a
90
in
my
book
speaks
volumes
for
hf
the
smokiness
in
this
is
strong
enough
that
i
cant
say
id
drink
it
every
day
regardless
of
the
obvious
quality
of
the
ingredients
and
process
its
a
great
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
have
another
if
that
puts
it
in
perspective
a
bit
o
i
say
this
with
respect
for
hf
products
but
a
smoked
beer
seems
more
of
a
novelty
to
me
the
smoky
flavor
was
clearly
represented
in
the
mouth
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
it
was
worth
a
try
though
o
very
nice
smoked
ale
not
overly
smokey
with
an
amazing
balance
i
was
under
the
presumption
that
this
was
george
based
and
i
can
totally
see
that
now
the
smoke
just
seems
to
take
away
the
hop
presence
that
george
does
so
well
but
its
all
good
the
balance
is
what
really
shines
here
overall
this
is
intense
but
very
strong
much
more
caramel
as
it
warms
but
still
strong
verging
on
rough
draft
at
blackback
waterbury
hd
is
a
deep
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
cap
of
beige
carbonation
the
base
structure
brings
out
a
lot
of
robust
malt
character
on
the
brown
ale
end
of
the
spectrum
in
a
balanced
complexity
browned
bread
toffee
and
caramel
chocolate
malt
and
deep
toast
alongside
runs
an
implanted
and
balanced
beechwood
smoke
meaty
and
very
pleasant
backs
up
well
to
the
firm
malt
back
on
the
fuller
side
of
moderate
in
body
with
a
moderate
gentle
carbonation
unique
from
any
other
smoked
beer
ive
had
very
nice
9232012
oa
great
beer
with
barbecue
this
had
a
great
smooth
feel
and
good
flavor
but
not
as
much
smoke
as
i
anticipated
overall
easily
the
best
smoked
beer
ive
had
yet
but
my
half
pour
was
more
than
enough
o
for
me
the
exceptional
mouthfeel
took
this
beer
from
good
to
very
good
more
impressive
scores
on
the
front
end
would
have
elevated
holger
danske
to
great
and
pretty
easily
but
as
always
the
experience
is
always
a
pleasure
cheers
beer
is
medium
in
body
a
nice
balance
of
smoky
and
sweet
on
the
palate
with
a
really
great
finish
the
roast
and
smoke
lingers
in
the
mouth
palate
for
several
seconds
making
the
beer
seem
dryer
than
it
is
definitely
smoke
forward
without
being
over
the
top
by
far
the
best
smoked
beer
ive
ever
had
o
depths
of
malt
flavor
with
the
smoke
nicely
complimentary
throughout
the
drink
and
never
overwhelms
the
other
aspects
overall
drinkable
and
pleasant
enough
but
unremarkable
more
so
coming
from
the
mighty
hill
o
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
smoked
beer
with
very
nice
richness
going
for
it
another
good
brew
from
hill
farmstead
overall
interesting
a
decent
smoked
beer
without
over
bitter
or
campfire
nice
flavors
long
tasty
finish
despite
being
a
good
beer
not
quite
as
high
caliber
as
most
of
the
other
hill
beers
overall
refined
but
straightforward
doesnt
do
much
but
what
it
does
is
delicious
and
unique
provides
a
great
fix
for
the
smoked
malt
lover
and
the
mouthfeel
is
to
die
for
im
not
a
big
fan
of
saying
to
die
for
but
its
something
you
say
about
perfect
caramel
and
brown
sugar

at

in

holy
its
labelled
smoke
but
its
very
understated
letting
some
of
the
other
flavors
bounce
and
play
off
of
it
a
bit
and
getting
more
forward
it
seems
the
smoke
character
actually
took
a
back
seat
but
it
still
made
for
an
interesting
take
on
the
final
product
letting
the
other
qualities
shine
through
unique
take
on
a
smoked
porter
decent
pours
dark
as
a
starless
night
massive
world
class

lacing
and

nice
rich
nose
of
caramel
sweetness
dark
fruit
plum
fig
over
a
light
note
of
smoke
as
it
warms
the
smokiness
increases
but
never
really
comes
to
the
forefront
heavy
medium
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
creamy
texture
above
average
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
in
the
middle
and
a
nice
burst
in
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
below
normal
intensity
extremely
well
balanced
and
a
bit
complex
it
begins
with
a
slightly
bitter
dark
chocolate
note
over
a
light
caramel
sweetness
this
flows
into
a
very
mild
bitterness
with
distinct
notes
of
dark
fruit
the
finish
is
where
a
light
hint
of
smoke
emerges
as
the
flavors
fade
this
one
is
good
but
there
is
no
big
smoke
aspect
a
pretty
tasty
porter
overall
strong
flavour
and
nothing
to
complain
about
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
big
smoke
flavour
and
it
wasnt
anything
hugely
different
but
an
enjoyable
drink
nonetheless
triednext
to
a
sample
of
barriers
undertow
rauchbier
and
found
it
less
smokey
and
with
less
sweet
chocolate
more
chalk
decent
but
not
my
favorite
the
big
smoke
name
is
apt
as
this
beer
is
defined
by
a
moderately
strong
smoke
aroma
and
flavor
that
is
well
supported
by
a
solidly
brew
porter
underneath
overall
not
as
advertised
smoke
flavour
is
almost
nonexistent
its
a
coffee
beer
if
anything
and
in
that
respect
not
a
great
one
being
intensely
bitter
and
just
a
bit
too
thin
prost
lampertland
o
i
am
not
a
big
smoked
ale
fan
despite
my
love
of
heavily
peated
scotch
but
this
one
was
nice
despite
being
significantly
smoked
id
have
preferred
the
chocolate
and
maybe
some
coffee
notes
stepping
up
to
match
the
smoke
its
got
the
right
depth
and
heft
for
a
porter
offering
a
well
sustained
strength
on
the
fuller
side
of
a
medium
body
theres
just
a
little
carbonation
enough
to
keep
things
going
while
a
nice
smoothness
rolls
along
bottle
poured
a
black
color
porter
with
a
light
brown
huge
foamy
head
with
excellent
retention
and
some
retention
bottle
even
kept
gushing
after
first
glass
had
been
poured
aroma
of
light
dry
roasted
malt
with
light
coffee
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
light
dry
roasted
malt
with
smoked
notes
almost
nonexistent
body
is
about
average
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
must
say
that
this
beer
was
quite
a
disappointment
compared
to
other
beers
from
the
same
brewery
with
the
smoked
notes
almost
nonexistent
makes
me
wonder
if
bottle
was
infected
or
something
since
it
was
gushing
a
bit
o
as
things
go
this
is
a
pretty
solid
porter
its
flavorful
lush
and
not
tooo
heavy
with
its
roasted
qualities
the
only
thing
i
find
disappointing
is
that
its
not
as
smoky
as
it
could
be
given
its
name
the
taste
was
strong
and
intense
of
smoky
dark
roasted
malt
very
tasty
o
this
beer
seemed
to
be
over
carbonated
and
requires
a
careful
pour
and
a
lot
of
patience
waiting
for
the
head
to
die
down
however
it
has
a
nice
amount
of
smoke
that
seems
to
be
well
incorporated
and
balanced
with
the
beers
aromas
and
flavors
could
use
more
carbonation
o
overall
this
beer
sure
delivered
what
it
promised
a
very
smokey
potent
brew
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
boom
what
a
beer
like
bonfire
night
personified
in
liquid
the
aroma
and
flavour
have
fantastic
depth
and
complexity
a
beautiful
and
wellrounded
mélange
perhaps
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
age
of
the
bottle
maybe
time
has
allowed
the
flavour
to
mellow
out
and
smooth
the
harshness
that
a
younger
brew
would
have
possessed
at
any
rate
this
is
lovely
and
well
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
good
fortune
to
stumble
across
it
this
is
one
of
the
best
smoked
porters
poured
at
about
cellar
temperature
with
a
colossal
super
frothy
foamy
billowy
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
plus
good
lacing
color
is

didnt

i
was
going

this

due

the
strong
smoked

this
subdued
slightly
as
time
went
on
and
it
turned
in
to
a
not

beer
it
could
have
slightly
better

it
was
one
that
i
enjoyed
and
was
a
somewhat
unusual
offering

at

overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
while
the
smoke
was
definitely
present
on
this
one
it
really
wasnt
the
star
of
the
show
the
roastiness
on
the
armoa
definitely
dominated
this
one
upon
first
inspection
on
the
flavor
i
was
really
quite
surprised
to
find
a
sweet
malty
aspect
going
on
i
dont
think
it
was
needed
and
rather
clashed
with
some
of
the
smokey
and
roasty
notes
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
defintely
not
my
favorite
o
its
says
big
smoke
and
thats
exactly
what
you
get
so
its
hard
to
argue
in
terms
of
rating
it
dont
bother
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
smoke
flavour
really
good
and
well
put
together
another
solid
offering
from
a
new
to
me
brewery
pricy
here
in
alberta
but
i
just
might
buy
one
to
tuck
away
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
a
smoked
beer
with
the
best
tendencies
imho
freak
me
out
with
aroma
do
a
context
shift
with
the
malt
for
the
taste
and
rest
on
your
laurels
thereafter
not
a
bad
thing
that
overall
a
nice
multivaried
if
not
overly
complex
smoked
beer
recommended
if
youve
the
cash
to
burn
o
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
at
first
i
thought
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
finish
this
smoky
brew
but
it
mellowed
and
was
pretty
tasty
the
flavor
is
a
great
deal
more
portery
than
the
aroma
rich
bitter
lightly
sour
porter
barley
starts
things
off
getting
a
bit
creamy
in
the
middle
and
ending
on
a
cross
between
firm
bitter
hops
and
light
smoke
flavoring
nicely
hopped
nicely
smoked
and
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
refreshing
and
remarkably
sessionable
beer
overall
the
smokiness
was
not
as
overpowering
as
i
usually
like
having
said
that
this
one
was
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
worth
a
try
but
wouldnt
seek
out
thanks
taturbo
the
long
journey
may
have
taken
a
toll
on
this
one
which
is
generally
muddy
tasty
very
drinkable
smoked
porter
good
and
substantive
hopping
worth
paying
up
for
i
drink
the
bomber
inside
of
half
an
hour
nice
colour
and
wine
like
hoppy
smoked
aroma
i
was
concerned
about
the
chocolate
muddling
up
the
character
of
this
smoked
porter
rather
it
smoothed
it
out
and
improved
drinkability
quite
a
tasty
smoke
brew
the
nose
pops
a
just
a
little
bit
more
than
the
rather
deflated
palate
which
is
a
shame
but
at
least
nothing
is
overthetop
or
blown
out
didnt
get
the
explosive
carbonation
that
others
seem
to
have
had
either

d
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
smokier
than
it

it
isnt

id
never
pay

for
a
bottle

it

in

its

is
pretty

just
like
the

the
brew
tastes

burntcharred

coffee

think
the

are

stronger

the
smoky

its
still
a
tasty
brew

is
medium
its
a

has

way
more
carbonation
than
i
would
like
for
this
beer
i
think
its
a
decent
enough
brew
overall
id
buy
this
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
ooh
some
smoked
goodness
from
a
new
country
kiwiland
lets
do
this
it
pours
a
clear
deep
dark
rubybrown
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
dusty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
rich
smoke
not
too
darkpeaty
but
thick
and
heavy
enough
to
really
make
an
impression
light
roasted
malts
mild
cocoa
walnut
and
a
few
drops
of
maple
syrup
the
taste
is
mostly
a
lithe
blend
of
smoke
chocolate
light
roast
and
maple
syrup
good
times
indeed
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
slightly
prickly
feel
overall
were
this
not
a
touch
light
and
overcarbonated
it
would
be
a
downright
great
smoked
porter
as
it
stands
it
is
very
very
good
and
i
would
never
turn
another
down
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
tight
carbonation
up
front
and
an
odd
metallic
flavor
that
covers
up
the
smoke
likely
infected
with
hints
of
charcoal
burnt
acrid
charred
toast
and
ash
very
dry
finish
really
gross
and
extremely
difficult
to
drink
m
soft
and
mellow
with
noticeable
co2
bite
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
would
get
it
again
depending
on
what
i
was
pairing
this
up
with
for
a
solid
dinner
option
d
the
500ml
bottle
would
probably
be
better
shared
by
two
people
due
to
the
intensity
of
the
smoked
flavors
but
the
lower
alcohol
made
this
fairly
easy
to
finish
an
enjoyable
smoked
porter
worked
my
way
through
the
bottle
while
listening
to
stravinskys
firebird
1919
version
o
full
flavoured
from
start
to
finish
like
a
vegetarian
version
of
a
schlenkerla
rauch
if
the
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
are
smoked
ham
hock
this
is
barbequed
eggplant
good
but
missing
some
grunt
not
sure
about
this
one
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
smokiness
maybe
its
the
subtlety
that
makes
it
good
ill
have
to
revisit
and
try
and
figure
it
out
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
smoky
but
well
balanced
definitely
worth
trying
the
aroma
was
thick
rich
with
peat
and
smoked
notes
if
you
like
smoked
beers
this
was
the
top
of
the
game
for
smelling
lots
of
light
fruity
notes
swilling
around
and
an
almost
molasses
like
sweetness
that
descended
upon
it
as
it
tried
to
warm
up
on
me
intensely
smoked
huge
rich
notes
of
peat
charcoal
wood
lots
of
earthy
and
vinous
properties
as
well
rich
notes
of
pine
almost
in
the
finish
attempted
to
dry
out
the
palate
but
were
pushed
aside
by
a
huge
smoked
malts
flavor
that
lasted
on
your
tongue
long
after
it
was
gone
for
as
rich
as
it
was
at
times
it
remained
wonderfully
balanced
and
continued
to
impress
me
with
that
aspect
of
it
the
carbonation
was
kind
of
low
which
caused
a
touch
of
flatness
to
it
enhancing
the
dry
finish
but
still
causing
a
distraction
overal
o
a
flavorful
and
not
overpowering
brew
a
great
introduction
to
the
flavor
of
smoked
malt
for
those
unfamiliar
with
the
smoked
styles
yeah
decent
complexity
and
nice
porter
notes
would
just
like
a
stronger
smoke
flavour
to
create
more
contrast
in
the
palate
otherwise
very
nice
o
if
you
couldnt
tell
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
me
the
smoke
is
nice
and
present
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
damn
near
perfect
im
not
calling
it
a
session
beer
but
its
one
that
i
could
drink
all
night
if
you
like
smoked
beers
youll
love
this
one
worth
getting
if
you
see
it
around
whew
thought
this
would
be
good
but
this
is
just
amazing
could
picture
myself
easily
sitting
in
a
pub
on
a
cold
night
roaring
fire
in
the
corner
and
drink
pint
after
pint
of
this
wonderful
in
short
a
smoked
porter
with
lots
of
finesse
and
superb
balance
between
the
malts
hops
and
roastderived
flavors
with
light
smokey
touch
lacking
any
harsh
burnt
or
greasy
notes

from

dirty

that
has
been
dipped
in
tar
even
though
it
smells
that
spectacular
to
me
i
venture
for
a
sip
somebody
ground
up
some
smokey
beef
jerkey
and
dumped
it
in
my
glass
the
carbonation
was
good
and
the
beer
rolled
on
my
tongue
nicely
everything
else
was
awful
and
i
mean
real
awful
two
sips
and
i
was
spent
do
overall
a
very

with

this

an
interesting
brew
that
is
easy
to

back
but
after
my
last
sampling
from
this
brewery
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
o
this
beer
isnt
too
difficult
to
drink
because
the
smoke
is
not
overpowering
but
novices
might
not
be
able
to
get
past
the
band
aid
flavors
overall
this
beer
was
different
but
in
a
good
way
i
get
over
the
fact
that
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
italian
meat
platter
and
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
overall
great
beer
i
had
some
pulled
pork
app
roasted
not
smoked
but
still
and
the
beer
went
very
well
with
it
on
the
whole
while
this
was
clearly
a
rauchbier
it
had
more
flavor
and
balance
than
most
that
ive
seen
which
tend
to
hit
you
over
the
head
with
smokiness
fine
by
me
as
i
like
that
flavor
but
theyre
often
very
onenote
this
was
a
great
beer
that
could
pair
well
with
a
ton
of
foods
with
the
backgrounds
notes
but
also
was
lighter
and
refreshing
id
definitely
try
it
again
overall
an
excellent
smoked
beer
very
user
friendly
and
suprisingly
refreshing
o
what
i
loved
was
how
such
a
light
beer
can
pack
so
much
smoke
im
used
to
a
smoked
porter
or
rauchbier
but
this
was
a
new
one
to
me
id
certainly
give
it
a
shot
when
considering
a
smoky
beer
pair
it
with
a
sweet
marinaded
meat
and
have
a
awesome
pairing
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
though
a
bit
muddling
in
the
finish
friends
and
i
emptied
the
growler
during
dinner
this
beer
is
big
on
comforting
qualities
and
was
an
excellent
trade
we
now
return
you
to
your
regularly
scheduled
show
medium
bodied
and
carbination
makes
this
a
well
balanced
brew
with
enough
hickory
smoked
malts
to
let
you
know
its
there
but
not
over
the
top
where
it
tastes
like
you
are
on
a
fire
fighters
practice
day
i
love
this
brew
not
only
as
a
great
sipper
but
also
as
one
that
i
will
continue
to
explore
food
pairings
with

got
a
fan
for

the
smoke
is
very
subdued
making
this
beer
rather
lifeless
but
as
you
drink
the
smoke
really
becomes

it

this

the

taste
buds
as
the
pint
continues
though
you
dont
really
get
closer
to
bacon
in
a
glass
than
this
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
little
more
watery
than
you
would
expect
overall
a
great
offering
a
completely
different
porter
than
anyone
else
is
offering
as
far
as
ive
ever
seen
overall
the
flavor
is
certainly
smokeforward
but
the
meatiness
is
delivered
with
a
delicate
touch
rather
than
a
heavy
hand
which
takes
this
beer
away
from
something
that
could
come
across
as
gimmicky
and
instead
makes
it
interesting
yet
highly
drinkable
absolutely
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
area
or
lucky
enough
to
find
it
on
local
taps
or
smaller
stores
mediumlight
in
body
tried
it
with
some
ham
to
see
if
would
be
more
complementary
but
it
battled
the
food
instead
of
blending
with
it
love
everything
else
ive
had
from
fullsteam
but
not
this
one
poured
a
roasted
chesnut
brown
into
color
with
a
nice
frothy
off
white
head
that
settled
into
a
creamy
mass
pretty
quicklyaromas
are
a
little
light
with
that
hickory
smoke
most
prominanta
tinge
coffee
roast
as
well
the
hickory
flavors
really
are
the
main
component
on
the
palate
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
to
muchits
not
intense
and
in
your
faceit
lingers
for
quite
awhile
a
slight
bitter
chocolate
note
in
the
backgroundand
peppery
spice
flavor
in
the
finish
round
out
the
flavor
profilethis
would
be
amazing
with
some
bbqi
agree
with
the
brewers
here
the
beer
feels
just
a
bit
thin
on
the
tongue
it
would
be
nice
if
it
stuck
around
just
a
slight
bit
longer
carbonation
is
just
right
for
the
style
medium
with
a
slight
prickle
but
not
effervescent
although
this
isnt
a
complex
beer
i
keep
going
back
for
more
thats
a
good
thing
considering
i
have
3
more
pints
of
it
in
the
fridge
overall
this
is
original
interesting
stuff
if
anything
it
reminds
me
of
a
rauchbier
or
something
else
so
highly
smoked
that
you
feel
like
youre
drinking
a
smoked
sausage
ontap
at
rockfish
grill
served
in
a
nice
sturdy
18oz
schooner
a
deep
almost
opaque
black
that
show
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
aroma
is
smoky
brown
malts
with
slight
cocoa
the
taste
is
hickory
smoked
dark
malts
up
front
with
a
nice
subtle
job
backbone
providing
nice
balance
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
coronation
this
is
a
great
overall
beer
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
know
it
will
be
even
more
enjoyable
on
a
cold
winter
night
first
off
this
is
a
smoked
porter
and
it
definitely
has
a
smoky
flavor
though
its
clean
and
not
particularly
peaty
its
definitely
not
for
faint
of
heart
and
meant
to
be
consumed
with
food
rather
than
by
itself
its
surprisingly
refreshing
for
a
smoked
porter
but
the
smoky
flavors
would
become
overpowering
if
i
were
just
trying
to
drink
a
six
pack
on
the
back
porch
on
the
other
hand
i
cant
imagine
anything
that
would
pair
better
with
pulled
pork
barbecue
or
many
strong
meat
flavors
and
spicy
foods
for
that
matter
an
area
where
many
beers
fall
flat
chili
rubbed
steak
burgers
sausage
jambalaya
even
o
finally
got
to
taste
this
fresh
and
its
quite
good
smoke
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
flavors
in
beer
but
this
one
does
a
nice
job
of
keeping
it
a
subtle
afterthought
to
the
wheat
base
really
no
idea
what
to
make
of
this
tastes
savoury
but
insubstantial
also
weird
overall
i
was
told
this
was
a
soured
smoked
wheat
beer
i
was
dissapointed
that
it
wasnt
very
tart
or
smokey
its
sounded
really
interesting
after
having
it
i
felt
that
was
a
gimmick
i
wouldnt
necessarily
call
this
a
smoke
beer
but
it
definately
is
a
beer
style
that
i
have
never
triedgratzer
ale
according
to
the
beer
label
average
and
nothing
too
interesting
here
cheers
all
othis
is
an
unique
beer
and
one
that
i
found
really
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
are
restrained
but
provide
enough
oomph
to
stay
interesting
if
you
want
super
sour
look
elsewhere
if
you
want
super
smokey
look
elsewhere
but
if
you
want
an
easydrinking
beer
that
would
go
well
with
bbq
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
good
choice
depending
who
you
ask
grodziskie
is
or
should
be
considered
its
own
style
styles
are
often
distinguished
either
by
the
use
of
a
specific
ingredient
unique
brewing
process
or
on
the
grounds
of
regional
tradition
grodziskie
qualifies
for
all
three
and
yet
its
still
not
widely
recognized
as
a
distinct
style
regardless
this
one
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
in
its
own
right
i
could
drink
this
beer
plenty
in
the
summer
months
its
an
easysipper
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
overall
this
turns
out
to
be
highly
quaffable
after
a
week
in
utah
i
am
sensitized
to
what
brewers
can
do
with
the
4
0
abv
limitation
and
this
one
gets
a
lot
of
flavor
with
minimum
hops
at
that
benchmark
from
the
500
ml
bottle
purchased
at
mayfair
liquors
in
denver
moutfeel
light
body
with
small
champagne
style
bubbles

well

taste
is
very
much
like
a
pils
ha
s
light
body
that
is
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
its
crisp
and
the
carbonation
is
just
like
a
good
pilsner
the
taste
is
citrusy
with
a
touch
of
lemon
a
little
spice
the
natural
sweetness
of
the
grain
and
the
tiny
touch
of
banana
for
smoothness
the
smoke
in
the
drink
remains
light
until
it
warms
then
you
can
taste
actual
smoke
it
finishes
with
a
nice
tart
flourish
and
a
bit
of
the
smoke
quality
a
nice
contrasting
sweetness
and
dry
overall
overall
its
very
interesting
theres
no
doubt
about
that
and
im
glad
to
be
able
to
say
ive
tried
a
grätzer
theres
some
level
of
integration
here
which
is
rather
pleasant
but
overall
it
just
doesnt
grab
me
despite
the
obvious
uniqueness
of
it
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
both
the
head
retention
and
lacing
are
decent
enough
the
aroma
is
light
the
brew
smells
like
wheat
smoke
and
some
fruitiness
it
mostly
tastes
like
smoked
malt
and
wheat
along
with
some
green
grapesgrape
skins
apples
and
a
bit
of
tart
lemon
the
label
says
its
a
sour
smoked
wheat
ale
but
there
really
isnt
much
tartsourness
in
this
at
all
with
that
being
said
its
not
a
bad
tasting
brew

a
bottle
i
dont
think
id
pay
that
price
for
this
again
but
it
was
nice
to
try
once
smells
of
straw
funk
and
a
little
fruit
cherries
apricot
pale
yellow
little
head
effervescent
with
lots
of
fine
bubbles
first
taste
is
for
wheat
and
smoke
unusual
but
tasty
smoke
is
not
overpowering
but
it
is
at
the
forefront
of
the
flavor
profile
sourness
becomes
more
noticeable
with
every
sip
and
is
refreshing
i
like
this
allot
basically
like
a
very
nice
berlinner
weisse
with
a
smoke
element
pleasant
aftertaste
does
not
coat
the
tongue
beer
is
of
mediumlight
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
smooth
slightly
foamy
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
closes
dry
with
little
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
or
lips
while
i
was
disappointed
that
the
advertised
smoked
wheat
malt
flavor
was
not
as
prominent
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
is
still
a
privilege
to
try
a
style
as
obscure
as
a
piwo
grodziskie
beer
from
grodzisk
which
i
would
encourage
more
brewers
to
adopt
to
spice
things
up
at
least
its
there
everything
is
really
mellow
and
subtle
including
the
smoky
woody
malty
flavor
at
the
finish
but
its
good
to
have
something
different
for
once
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
7
or
so
i
paid
for
it
but
fans
of
german
wheat
beers
to
try
it
at
least
once
soft
and
mellow
smokiness
with
a
little
kick
of
tartness
the
wheat
malts
create
a
smooth
body
and
the
finish
is
nice
and
crisp
pepperygrassy
bitterness
rounds
things
off
for
a
clean
and
refreshing
beer
that
could
be
paired
with
food
or
could
stand
alone
t
it
starts
with
a
mild
kick
of
golden
apple
then
starts
to
feel
like
its
going
to
get
tart
but
it
never
really
does
theres
just
a
kiss
of
tart
before
a
long
wet
wheat
and
grain
finish
the
golden
apple
flavor
carries
through
the
finish
as
well
theres
just
a
hint
of
smoked
sea
salt
on
the
finish
but
this
never
really
becomes
that
smoky
its
smooth
and
pretty
refreshing
i
wouldnt
call
it
bursting
with
flavor
but
its
pleasant
interesting
and
refreshing
but
just
ok
overall
probably
nice
on
a
summers
eve
out
by
the
pool
not
in
the
heat
of
the
day
o
this
is
an
example
of
a
smoked
beer
done
really
well
if
you
dont
like
smoked
beers
then
stay
away
but
the
beer
has
a
surprising
amount
of
flavor
which
stands
up
to
the
light
smoking
of
the
malts
o
not
bad
just
dull
maybe
dull
is
not
the
right
word
dainty
comes
across
like
a
stupidmellow
bamberg
smoker
pours
a
slightly
hazy

decent

smells
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
wheat
slight
hops
lemon
and
slight
clove
does
not
seem
to
fit
the
smoked
beer
category
more
aptly
applies
to
a
berliner
weissbier
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
tartness
tastes
of
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
sight
hops
slight
wheat
hint
of
smoke
slight
minerals
lemon
and
a
hint
of
clove
overall
decent
blend
body
and
aroma
but
smoke
is
almost
nonexistent
pours
an
orangish
yellow
color
fairly
hazy
slightly
offwhite
head
kinda
rocky
fades
pretty
quickly
not
a
very
pretty
beer
but
its
not
an
important
consideration
to
me
the
aroma
is
smoke
with
some
spicy
mineralish
hops
theres
a
touch
of
sourness
and
a
kinda
stale
malt
flavor
very
mild
taste
is
a
bit
better
its
mildly
tart
with
some
nice
background
wheat
and
malt
sweetness
low
level
of
bitterness
good
mix
of
wheat
and
hop
spiciness
with
yeast
or
maybe
actual
spicing
sort
of
a
grassy
wheaty
finish
some
funky
earthy
flavors
are
also
in
the
mix
mild
woody
smoke
a
little
too
much
sweetness
for
my
palate
or
id
go
higher
with
my
score
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
full
id
prefer
the
beer
to
be
a
touch
crisper
but
the
smoke
might
make
that
kinda
odd
relatively
low
carbonation
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
its
just
a
bit
mild
and
the
malt
sweetness
doesnt
quite
seem
right
i
also
wonder
if
a
fresher
bottle
would
have
a
little
more
hop
kick
to
it
as
the
label
alludes
to
hops
as
a
highlight
and
they
dont
really
come
across
with
much
strength
still
im
always
happy
to
try
lesser
known
and
historical
styles
very
unique
stuff
get
yourself
a
bottle
of
this
for
the
sake
of
science
if
nothing
else
you
would
do
well
to
disregard
this
review
as
im
85
sure
this
is
a
case
of
beer
that
has
gone
bad
rather
than
beer
i
dont
like
i
love
smokey
beers
how
it
skunked
is
a
mystery
in
the
brown
bottle
but
im
going
to
try
and
get
a
refund
on
this
one
if
i
can
o
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
smoked
beer
but
rather
a
wheat
beer
with
a
mild
smoke
nonetheless
its
tasty
clean
and
enjoyable
i
was
pleased
to
give
it
a
whirl
but
it
wont
be
something
i
will
be
charging
back
to
the
store
for
and
grabbing
up
each
and
every
time
i
see
it
now
if
i
can
just
find
a
recipe
to
brew
this
at
home
a
fascinating
resurrected
relic
of
a
beer
style
well
done
herr

i
could
see
this
being
one
of
those
cool
beers
to
pick
up
once
a
year
best
used
when
grilling
around
the
pool
in
summertime
the
beer
poured
a
light
hazy
amber
that
produced
a
nice
white
foamy
head
that
was
retained
for
a
minute
or
so
and
then
faded
into
a
thin
ring
the
aroma
was
interesting
as
it
boasted
mainly
a
smoky
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
good
upfront
it
tasted
more
like
hefe
but
at
the
back
end
the
smoke
kicked
in
with
a
slight
pepper
quality
as
well
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
with
decent
carbonation
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
one
that
i
might
be
tempted
to
drink
again
o
aside
from
bootleggers
wildfire
wheat
ive
never
had
a
smoked
wheat
beer
this
is
great
more
brewers
should
do
this
itd
be
great
for
a
bbq
overall
i
liked
this
just
fine
the
smoke
flavour
and
amount
is
actually
pretty
nice
not
the
least
bit
overdone
professor

maybe
two
fingers
worth
of

up

linger
for

fading
the
nose
is
very
interesting
featuring
well
balanced
interplay
between
smoke
spicy
saaz
hops
and
a
touch
of
tart
citric
lemon
the
flavor
profile
leads
off
with
a
bit
of
a
grainy
wheat
taste
only
for
a
peppery
flourish
from
the
hops
to
come
in
next
a
light
smokiness
comes
in
for
the
close
though
its
not
particularly
intense
it
does
manage
to
blunt
most
of
the
impact
of
the
delicate
sourness
present
or
at
least
anticpated
based
on
the
aroma
the
body
has
a
little
more
heft
than
i
might
have
anticipated
from
a
4
beer
and
the
carbonation
just
doesnt
quite
liven
the
beer
up
enough
this
gratzers
a
fairly
unique
kind
of
beer
and
one
that
im
glad
i
tried
dont
know
if
id
actively
seek
out
another
one
though
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
slighlty
coudy
light
orange
amber
this
white
head
leaves
islands
of
foam
and
a
ring
around
the
glass
no
lacing
aroma
of
light
bready
malt
wheat
and
a
hint
of
smoke
flavor
starts
with
light
wheat
lemon
and
faint
smokiness
becomes
a
little
sweeter
with
light
wheat
and
malt
and
finishes
with
somewhat
abrupt
dry
wheat
with
faint
memories
of
sour
wheat
and
smoke
very
subtly
flavored
but
interesting
flavor
progression
light
bodied
but
to
style
for
a
wheat
beer
an
interesting
nearly
extinct
local
style
that
is
well
worth
bringing
back
for
its
unique

tastes
more

sweeter

traces
of
smoke
lingering
in

finish
pretty
good
but
if
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
and
there
was
a
bit
more
smoke
i
would
love
it
interesting
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
this
is
super
drinkable
the
smell
is
a
bit
off
putting
but
wow
is
this
a
quaffer
i
want
a

taste
is

and
campfire
flavors
there
is
a
slight
sourness
on
the
tongue
with
each
sip
but
nothing
too
strong
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
an
interesting
style
for
sure
perhaps
to
one
day
be
added
to
the
style
list
on
ba
im
ok
with
this
one
and
glad
i
tried
this
version
of
a
this
forgotten
style
but
nothing
id
rush
out
to
get
again
tasty
different
and
just
ok
o
extremely
interesting
and
something
that
i
think
i
could
enjoy
more
regularly
a
very
interesting
style
and
a
nice
example
which
is
quite
successful
mixture
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
make
this
beer
easy
to
enjoy
and
sessionable
a
great
sessionable
sour
wheat
beer
o
the
pour
and
the
smell
had
me
excited
this
beer
is
median
at
best
o
not
bad
but
all
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
pretty
weak
however
this
is
enjoyable
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
beer
worth
trying
o
this
beer
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
forgotten
style
and
seems
to
resemble
a
hybrid
between
a
rauchbier
with
the
smoke
and
a
berliner
weissbier
with
the
sourness
the
lightbodied
nature
and
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
very
easy
to
drink
d
with
historical
styles
like
this
it
can
sometimes
be
kind
of
hard
to
judge
but
in
this
case
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
by
any
standard
reminiscent
of
a
gose
with
an
even
more
spicy
character
and
light
but
noticeable
smoke
character
that
is
at
its
strongest
in
the
aroma
like
the
other
fritz
briem
beers
this
is
a
must
try
for
any
true
beer
geek
smoky

oddly
enough
with

and
a
flash
of

upfront
lingering
aftertaste
of

and
vague

even

maybe
tartness
is
gentle
and
not
overly

aftertaste
is
really
mild
and
pleasant
actually
carbonation
is
fairly
low
and
its
medium
bodied
something
different
to
be
sure
hope
this
historical
series
continues
its
been
a
while
since
i
was
excited
to
try
a
polishstyle
beer
this
one
pours
a
lightly
hazy
goldenrod
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
dirty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemoncoated
must
light
wisps
of
smoke
and
toasted
wheat
i
cant
say
this
is
the
most
appealing
smell
in
the
world
but
its
not
all
bad
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
mildly
tart
lemon
flavor
then
goes
into
a
lightly
smoky
haze
then
revisits
the
sourness
with
some
sour
funky
wheat
again
like
the
smell
things
just
dont
come
across
as
appealing
with
neither
the
sourness
nor
the
smoke
coming
through
well
enough
strong
enough
for
either
to
succeed
even
when
they
start
to
cooperate
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sticky
finish
overall
an
interesting
trip
into
brewing
history
but
this
artifact
just
doesnt
work
for
me
smoked

what
beer
from
professor
fritz
briem
maker
of
one
of
the
finest
berliner
weisse
around
im
there
pours
a
clear
honeygold
with
a
soapy
white
head
lovely
aromas
of
beechwood
smoke
wheat
malt
and
lactic
acid
with
a
slight
herbal
character
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
nice
balance
of
smoke
wheat
and
lactic
acid
with
just
a
touch
of
funk
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
westbrook
smoked
berliner
weisse
i
had
at
brewvival
last
year
but
not
as
clean
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
a
slightly
watery
feel
and
lowish
carbonation
overall
a
very
unique
beer
that
im
hoping
gets
bottled
in
the
future
incredibly
happy
to
have
tried
this
overall
thanks
to
maxs
for
this
rare
offering
refreshing
brew
and
hope
the
style
popularity
grows
all
things
considered
this
is
pretty
impressive
grodziskie
is
a
polish
wheatstyle
brew
from
the
days
of
yore
this
current
draught
rendition
from
germany
arrived
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
big
sticky
white
cap
of
foam
this
brew
certainly
has
wheat
character
but
the
smokey
skeleton
brings
it
together
the
aroma
is
nutty
and
interesting
the
body
is
thick
with
wheat
the
flavors
are
earthy
smokey
and
yeasty
a
slight
touch
of
spice
at
the
end
provides
balance
an
interesting
recreation
of
a
bygone
beer
overall
i
had
a
tough
time
describing
this
one
really
different
tastes
like
a
bad
fermentation
take
a
pass
the
new
version
of
this
2015
is
a
complete
mess
of
a
beer
gross
sweaty
smell
mild
sour
taste
with
some
smokiness
nothing
like
the
old
version
this
version
is
all
bungled
up
with
nothing
substantial
to
offer
would
decline
this
overall
the
taste
is
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
love
what
this
beer
does
in
a
gin
barrel
viking
metal
but
as
it
is
its
still
a
little
too
weird
for
me
to
want
to
return
to
regularly
the
taste
brings
a
tangy
yeast
element
with
light
malt
quality
and
slight
smoke
in
the
initial
flavor
impression
with
subtle
spiciness
which
could
also
be
considered
herbal
hop
with
mild
yeast
tanginess
and
light
malt
nuttiness
with
a
slight
herbal
quality
carrying
through
into
the
dry
crisp
finish
this
is
great
with
very
good
drinkability
in
general
i
appreciate
the
chance
to
try
this
old
world
style
and
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
i
expected
an
interesting
brew
my
bottle
has
been
cellared
for
a
year
and
tastes
different
better
than
a
fresher
bottle
i
dont
know
what
gale
tastes
like
but
the
juniper
is
barely
noticeable
i
think
if
i
lived
on
an
island
off
the
coast
of
sweden
id
probably
brew
and
drink
a
lot
of
this
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
ale
with
a
nice
generous
white
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
salty
rustic
malt
notes
with
some
spices
juniper
and
light
smoked
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
a
unique
mix
of
juniper
smoked
notes
with
some
salty
rustic
malt
notes
clearly
identifiable
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
very
interesting
beers
for
sure
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
feel
the
need
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
o
worth
the
journey
for
this
tasty
brew
indeed
not
to
the
liking
of
all
but
hit
the
spot
on
a
mild
almostspring
night
o
very
interesting
i
like
it
but
its
not
something
id
reach
for
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
balance
between
the
flavors
of
juniper
and
smoked
malts
o
really
easy
drinking
for
the
style
the
smoke
seems
natural
and
complimenting
not
forced
sometimes
smoked
beers
are
just
plain
hard
to
drink
due
to
the
massive
smoke
profile
this
is
not
the
case
this
is
about
six
months
old
so
the
smoke
may
have
faded
a
bit
but
i
like
it
overall
i
give
this
a
4
its
a
solid
beer
and
so
far
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
this
brewery
i
do
love
rauchbiers
and
this
is
pretty
much
one
except
ive
never
had
one
with
these
ingredients
sweet
gale
and
juniper
also
the
different
woods
used
to
smoke
these
grains
are
an
excellent
touch
overall
definitely
an
intriguing
beer
this
will
pair
amazing
with
some
bbq
andor
smoked
rack
of
ribs
will
definitely
buy
again
when
i
get
the
urge
to
pillage
a
neighboring
city
overall
very
interesting
and
unique
pretty
well
done
but
a
bit
too
much
residual
sugar
somehow
even
with
all
that
carbonation
it
brings
the
smoked
malts
are
nice
as
well
as
sweet
gale
juniper
is
barely
detectable
mostly
and
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
bitterness
i
think
but
still
a
very
unique
and
tasty
beer
to
try
d
nice
smoked
saison
good
balance
of
smoke
spices
and
yeast
character
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
that
is
not
overdone
which
is
what
i
was
expecting
based
on
the
huge
head
o
so
smokey
it
is
hard
to
taste
much
else
provided
by
jj
served
with
a
large
foamy
frothy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
all
the
way
down
color
is
a
hazy
amber
aroma
is
yeast
smoke
sour
with
notes
of
fruit
flavors
like
nose
smoke
is
prominant
but
not
overdone
again
a
bit
tart
bodys
decent
good
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
fairly
easy
drinking
would
killer
to
cook
with
o
i
had
very
little
expectations
for
this
one
but
im
glad
i
had
it
first
smoky
beer
ive
had
like
this
not
thick
not
stouty
or
a
porter
but
maintained
an
awesome
smoky
flavor
and
had
a
good
light
body
id
drink
again
cheers
pretty
decent
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
i
am
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
and
this
is
a
bit
of
a
rustic
smoke
beer
that
brings
something
unique
to
the
plate
inspired
by
the
drink
of
gotland
this
beer
will
make
you
feel
like
a
true
viking
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
i
think
i
love
it
you
have
to
approach
the
beer
knowing
what
goes
into
the
beer
because
if
you
arent
thinking
juniper
and
sweet
gale
you
will
miss
this
beer
entirely
pretty
awesome
beer
overall
another
unique
offering
from
jester
king
more
of
an
everyday
beer
than
most
smoked
ales
and
like
certain
sodas
room
temp
and
nearly
flat
suits
it
well
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
savor
ill
certainly
pick
it
up
again
this
is
a
pretty
strange
beer
it
is
technically
sound
for
a
smoked
beer
but
the
flavors
are
not
something
that
i
enjoy
at
all
the
smoked
aroma
and
flavor
do
not
play
well
with
the
juniper
it
is
too
much
like
liquid
campfire
in
a
bottle
to
be
enjoyable
overall
not
bad
i
can
see
myself
sipping
on
this
if
offered
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
drinkin
this
with
my
corn
dog
and
a
bum
pours
up
a
dark
hued

with
endless

the

bit
of

and
funkiness
play
through
hints
of
tart
citrus
zest
dried

funky
barnyard
and
tangy
wheat
its
actually
pretty
well
balanced
but
the
smoke
still
sticks
out
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
bubbles
are
ample
and
the
body
of
gotlandsdricka
is
mediumlight
on
the
palate
clean
finish
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
and
light
fruit
overall
i
found
this
jester
king
offering
to
be
an
interesting
addition
to
their
lineup
although
its
not
something
ill
be
seeking
out
again
and
not
worth
the
13
price
tag
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
palateexpanding
to
say
the
least
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
an
effervescent
level
of
prickly
lively
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
and
the
level
of
carbonation
helps
to
move
and
blend
the
flavors
this
is
a
curious
and
diffrent
sort
of
brew
i
admittedly
researched
this
style
prior
to
gettin
the
chance
to
try
it
and
i
was
expecting
a
juniper
inclusion
that
seemed
absent
here
i
gotta
admit
the
lack
of
juniper
character
might
be
the
reason
i
enjoyed
this
throwing
juniper
into
this
mix
would
have
been
a
trainwreck
im
sure
this
isnt
a
beer
i
see
myself
getting
thirsty
for
or
craving
however
i
wouldnt
avoid
having
it
again
sometime
either
rjt
m
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
very
good
worth
trying
o
dear
god
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
just
terrible
that
it
made
me
gag
on
the
first
sip
just
nasty
decent
and
i
get
what
they
are
trying
to
do
though
not
something
i
am
coming
back
to
i
think
the
house
yeast
that
jk
is
using
shows
itself
bestis
more
developed
here
that
is
a
shame
because
it
does
not
mingle
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
jester
king
says
its
giving
the
beer
additional
fermentation
with
wild
yeast
and
souring
bacteria
we
presently
have
a
version
of
gotlandsdricka
that
we
inoculated
with
wild
yeast
and
bacteria
aging
in
oak
barrels
i
cant
wait
o
i
guess
its
a
bit
hard
to
rate
against
style
when
there
isnt
else
like
it
never
the
less
not
a
bad
beer
the
smokiness
is
restrained
while
the
yeast
is
rather
prevalent
oa
very
nice
take
on
the
smoked
beer
style
but
a
little
more
sweetness
would
balance
this
one
out
better
and
it
is
rather
bitter
moderate
level
of
smoke
well
integrated
and
not
overbearing
the
juniper
and
gale
are
subdued
and
come
off
more
as
general
spice
than
anything
with
some
light
bitter
phenolics
as
well
aftertaste
of
honeyed
malt
and
soft
oak
smokiness
a
mellow
woodderived
astringency
cuts
through
the
ample
and
frothy
carbonation
as
a
historical
recreation
of
an
ancient
simple
smoked
ale
its
definitely
interesting
especially
as
a
swede
myself
but
a
little
onenote
overall
d
difficult
to
compare
to
style
since
this
is
my
first
gotlandsdricka
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
wellbalanced
complex
and
yet
understated
brew
i
have
had
nothing
like
it
and
i
love
it
the
drinking
experience
brings
immediately
to
mind
a
vikings
existence
seek
it
out
if
you
can
drink
of
the
good
land
with
the
smoke
coming
through
stronger
throughout

despite
the
nasty

this
is
more
a

from

a
little
bit
of
lacing
which
eventually
disappears
completely
its
got
great
retention
and
eventually
fades
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
whilst
youre
enjoying
this
on
the
nose
tonnes
of
peat
smoke
aromas
a
little
bit
of
rye
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
i
love
smoked
beers
so
this
made
we
want
to
put
it
straight
down
the
hatch
on
the
palate
lots
of
smoke
to
begin
with
rich
dark
chocolate
toffee
burnt
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
a
citrusy
finish
what
an
amazing
complex
flavour
the
carbonation
is
pretty
high
for
the
style
but
it
was
to
be
expected
with
this
style
and
actually
brings
out
the
complexity
in
this
brew
its
smooth
and
finishes
medium
dry
what
a
beer
for
spring
weather
although
its
seriously
smokey
the
other
flavours
in
there
are
ridiculously
balanced
quite
a
tasty
beer
if
you
know
what
youre
getting
yourself
into
and
you
should
if
you
read
the
label
hard
to
say
this
is
a
steal
at
4
but
its
a
good
beer
id
definitely
have
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
it
love
the
mild
smokiness
and
full
flavor
nicely
done
great
beer
if
you
are
able
to
get
past
the
ridiculously
overpowering
smokiness
on
the
nose
while
the
picture
shows
it
as
a
smoked
stout
my
bottle
bottled
on
03072014
states
a
smoked
porter
smokey
slap
to
the
face
hints
of
dark
chocolate
black
pepper
and
strong
black
coffee
smells
just
like
an
ashtray
as
stated
in
the
name
with
hints
of
a
bitter
cocoa
good
though
never
knew
something
smelling
of
an
ashtray
could
taste
so
good
o
it
is
possible
that
the
smoke
died
over
the
past
year
but
smoke
doesnt
seem
like
something
that
would
fade
with
time
aroma
of
cocoa
and
licorice
smoke
and
leather
rich
and
bold
flavor
immediately
hits
the
taste
buds
smoke
and
espresso
cocoa
root
beer
and
a
hint
of
cherry
lots
of
flavors
lots
of
character
very
complex
malts
are
darkly
toasted
no
bitter
roast
flavor
hops
are
understated
but
theres
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
slightly
ashen
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
lingers
perhaps
hence
the
name
full
mouth
feel
moderate
carbonation
alcohol
strength
is
masked
by
the
flavors
very
good
beer
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
dimpled
mug
apparently
smoked
porters
arent
really
my
thing
i
love
stone
but
i
didnt
like
their
smoked
porter
with
vanilla
bean
and
it
is
highly
rated
with
this
the
pour
color
and
mouth
feel
were
fine
but
i
got
smoked
fish
and
band
aid
in
the
nose
and
the
flavor
came
off
like
burnt
band
aid
i
have
liked
almost
all
evil
twin
brews
i
have
had
but
this
was
a
major
disappointment
at
least
for
me
again
it
is
probably
just
not
my
style
but
i
think
it
would
of
went
well
with
bbqed
pork
as
a
pairing
had
on
tap
at
meadhall
in
cambridge
few
weeks
ago
served
in
a
snifter
interesting
stoutmeetssmoke
beer
combination
good
taste
but
probably
couldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
fairly
light
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
slightly
oily
ashtray
is
a
good
comparison
needs
food
pairings
like
cheese
or
meat
neither
of
which
i
had
when
i
drank
it
first
off
the
current
labeling
as
a
smoked
porter
is
what
i
would
call
this
and
as
such
it
works
its
the
expected
oil
can
black
with
a
beautiful
head
and
lace
the
aroma
is
smoked
roast
malts
the
taste
is
a
rich
creamy
roastyheavily
smoked
flavor
like
the
best
rauch
bier
ive
had
smoked
porters
before
but
this
one
is
american
styleover
the
top
im
going
to
seek
out
more
evil
twins
theyhave
been
spectacular
swerve
o
about
what
i
expected
the
smoke
wasnt
overpowering
but
definitely
the
lead
character
in
this
show
the
best
smoked
beer
ive
had
really
nice
smoke
flavor
aroma
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
giving
evil
twins
reputation
and
what
they
wrote
on
the
label
i
was
expecting
the
smokey
aspect
to
be
more
intense
than
it
was
and
that
could
be
because
of
the
age
but
i
have
noticed
age
effect
the
smoke
that
much
in
my
experience
so
im
not
sure
about
that
this
beer
had
a
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
creamy
a
little
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
anymore
than
that
and
it
might
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
complexity
the
cherry
flavors
added
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
to
it
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
roasted
malts
and
smoke
werent
just
a
little
stronger
i
found
myself
wishing
those
aspects
were
more
intense
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
it
isnt
something
im
going
to
stock
up
on
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
think
it
was
a
little
unique
for
the
style
this
isnt
my
favorite
evil
twin
beer
or
my
favorite
smoked
beer
it
falls
above
the
middle
in
both
categories
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
nice
smoked
porter
keep
up
the
solid
work
dark
pour
with
very
high
carbonation
producing
a
thick
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
the
tasting
smells
like
burnt
wood
bacon
and
oranges
medium
body
made
a
bit
rough
by
the
high
carbonation
fruit
bitterness
chocolate
and
dark
cherries
and
a
moderate
amount
of
alcohol
bottle
from
hop
city
pours
dark
black
with

aroma
of
light
smoke
chocolate
spices
and
coffee
flavor
of
chocolate
molasses
and
smoke
with
a
strong
booze
aftertaste
heavy

its
like
drinking
a
boozy
camp
fire
very
good
very
rich
and
intense
with
a
savory
aroma
and
a
delicious
complex
flavor
the
texture
as
well
is
well
balanced
and
satisfying
what
a
uniquely
flavorful
way
to
kick
off

very

as
well
there
really
isnt
a
bad
brew
by
evil
twin
absolutely
delicious
a
really
decadent
smoked
beer
here
called
a
porter
but
definitely
an
imperial
maybe
even
a
stout
thought
it
was
normal
abv
when
opened
and
was
shocked
to
read
the
bottle
at
nearly
9
one
of
the
better
evil
twin
brews
going
a
definitely
the
best
smoked
dark
beer
i
can
remember
of
late
chalky
finished
dark
brown
beer
silky
smooth
and
alluring
enticing
and
all
dolled
up
with
a
full
inch
of
rich
dark
mocha
head
the
nose
is
a
mixture
of
sweet
and
bakers
chocolates
with
a
ton
of
smoke
on
it
not
the
lighter
cherrywood
type
but
proper
heavy
german
rauch
stuff
fireside
smelling
and
balanced
well
with
lots
of
special
dark
malts
rich
caramel
middle
in
the
taste
is
the
real
surprise
never
expected
such
a
robust
desserty
vibe
to
this
i
dont
know
why
i
underestimated
it
but
i
did
love
the
intense
chocolate
without
the
sweetness
and
the
way
the
smoke
makes
everything
pop
without
crowding
out
the
clever
malt
bill
in
any
way
at
all
full
bodied
almost
syrupy
texture
but
i
find
myself
drinking
it
too
quickly
its
just
so
smooth
and
flavorful
and
im
curious
for
more
than
the
one
bottle
i
have
strong
but
well
hidden
alcohol
it
drinks
like
dessert
honestly
what
makes
it
special
is
the
grain
one
of
the
best
smoke
beers
ive
had
and
one
i
need
to
snag
more
of
really
worth
trying
really
enjoyed
this
one
forgiving
with
the
smokiness
but
generous
with
the
hops
and
the
nice
roasty
chocolate
might
seem
a
bit
rough
but
nothing
too
hard
to
stomach
pours
a
black
color
one
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
strong
smoke
roasted

sweet

and
a
hint
of
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
russian
imperial
stout

feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted

sweet

hint
of

hint
of
chocolate
and
yeast
overall
a
great
ris
good
appearance

blend
and
complexity
the
hops
are
very
minimal
which
allows
many
other
characteristics
to
shine
particularly
the
smoke
yeast
and
sweet
malt
the
earthiness
of
this
brew
is
amazing
best
taste
of
an
ashtray

cheers
not

for
a
high

dark
ale
but
the
smoke
aspect
is
mia
in
the
flavor
and
barely
perceptible
in
the
smell
o
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
definitely
have
again
sacrilege
but
maybe
on
nitro
poured
into
a
chalice
a
dark
copper
laced
head
that
receded
quickly
into
the
dark
body
smokey
on
the
nose
but
a
more
hearty
coffee
flavor
on
this
stout
defined
porter
more
smokey
on
smell
but
less
substantial
than
most
stouts
acidic
at
first
taste
yet
seemingly
low
carbonation
affected
the
final
texture
a
decent
beer
but
below
evil
twin
name
overall
a
very
good
imperial
smoked
porterstout
good
roasty
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
kick
of

o
a
pretty
good
beer
it
has
nice
sweet
and
smoky
flavors
my
criticism
would
be
id
like
to
see
a
little
more
of
the
toasted
malts
come
to
play
to
help
cut
the
sweetness
and
meatlike
flavors
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
if
you
like
smoked
beers
this
should
be
a
try
for
you
nothing
overpowering
and
the
smoke
isnt
too
in
your
face
to
enjoy
its
8
9
but
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
hide
any
alcohol
flavors
making
this
dangerous
pours
to
a
dark
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
eighthinch
layer
with
leggy
lacing
that
slides
back
down
to
the
head
color
is
what
it
should
be
aroma
is
sweet
smoky
bbq
sauce
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
flavor
is
predominantly
roasted
barley
and
smoked
malt
with
some
malty
sweetness
chocolate
and
nuts
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
dense
and
slightly
sugary
the
way
i
like
it
carbonation
is
low
which
is
expected
overall
a
fine
imperial
stout
with
a
little
something
extra
the
beers
malty
body
and
sweetness
supports
the
bold
smoke
character
well
however
i
would
prefer
to
see
heavier
texture
more
sweetness
and
a
deeper
level
of
complexity
even
if
it
comes
at
the
risk
of
tenplus
percent
in
alcohol
oh
darn
drinks
easy
for
the
abv
style
not
bad
but
would
rather
have
some
alaskan
smoked
porter
any
day
of
the
week
a
licorice
black
colored
brew
with
a
fair
dark
tan
head
and
modest
bits
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
big
with
chewy
licorice
smoked
malt
and
veggie
evergreen
hop
there
is
an
ashy
idea
here
but
it
comes
off
very
nice
the
flavor
brings
out
a
tart
prune
malt
shrouded
in
cigar
ash
and
leathery
tobacco
theres
a
little
bit
of
whole
grain
flavor
deep
down
but
its
hard
to
overcome
the
primary
smoky
theme
this
is
medium
plus
bodied
porter
with
a
fairly
chewy
but
smooth
feel
with
quiet
carbonation
as
porters
go
this
is
a
big
flavored
brew
and
i
can
see
it
being
a
controversial
one
either
really
like
it
or
really
dislike
it
its
easily
a
good
one
for
me
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
offering
as
i
love
smoked
beers
especially
evil
twins
the
cowboy
this
stout
pours
very
near
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
and
a
small
but
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
appealing
with
lots
of
coffee
and
chocolate
offset
with
a
subtle
smokiness
and
sweet
vanilla
the
flavor
is
unfortunately
not
as
inviting
it
is
very
one
note
with
an
avalanche
of
smoke
and
coffee
no
depth
at
all
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
if
you
havent
had
anything
like
it
before
but
otherwise
seek
out
something
like
founders
smoked
porter
for
a
much
better
take
on
this
style
overall
another
interesting
brew
from
evil
twin
but
lacks
the
intensity
of
his
other
works
such
as
lil
b
or
imp
biscotti
worth
a
try
if
available
simply
to
keep
your
beer
palate
intrigued
but
not
one
to
seek
out
overall
above
average
to
good
beer
closer
to
good
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
from
evil
twin
but
i
guess
they
cant
all
be
really
good
for
fans
of
smoked
beers
dont
expect
too
much
its
a
solid
porter
with
hints
of
smoke
but
not
much
else
worth
a
try
but
get
some
of
evil
twins
other
stuff
if
youre
undecided
overall
another
interesting
beer
put
out
by
evil
twin
not
my
favorite
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
smoked
beers
full
bodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
and
a
very
intense
burntsmoke
flavor
really
overwhelming
with
strong
acrid
unpleasantness
everything
tastes
like
burning
charred
toast
burnt
malt
charcoal
burnt
wood
and
ashtray
really
strong
but
the
phenol
presence
isnt
as
bad
as
expected
its
there
but
not
as
offensive
as
it
is
in
the
aroma
still
this
beer
is
very
harsh
and
a
chore
to
choke
down
im
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
i
didnt
like
this
beer
at
all
an
enjoyable
beer
too
bad
the
great
aroma
didnt
carry
over
to
the
taste
11
2
ounce
bottle
best
before
2015
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
a
bit
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
i
like
the
aroma
a
lot
the
brew
smells
like
smoked
malt
chocolate
bandaids
peat
burntcharred
malt
and
some
coffee
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
dark
fruit
and
an
earthy
flavor
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
slick
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
brew
although
its
pricey
at
8
99
a
bottle
id
buy
this
one
again
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
smoked
stouts
o
there
is
a
lot
of
complexity
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
with
some
really
interesting
aspects
but
it
is
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
name
is
very
appropriate
as
i
think
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
an
ashtray
and
as
a
nonsmoker
it
is
slightly
offputting
eh
a
little
let
down
its
got
its
good
parts
but
its
nothing
special
as
far
as
smoke
beers
go
no
mention
of
the
nearly
9
at
any
point
the
booze
is
entirely
hidden
good
example
of
the
style
but
cost
a
little
more
then
id
want
to
spend
on
a
second
bottle
overall
an
interesting
variant
to
the
ris
style
the
smokiness
is
well
done
and
adds
some
complexity
would
be
great
with
some
smoked
meats
okay
thats
the
end
of
the
notes
i
didnt
pick
up
any
of
the
smokey
or
vinous
nodes
that
people
pick
up
once
theyve
been
informed
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
russian
imperial
power
of
suggestion
maybe
as
it
stood
it
wasnt
really
a
stellar
example
of
its
purported
style
but
its
still
a
damn
fine
beer
bottle
at
torst
big
smoke
ash
smell
but
its
great
as
i
like
the
style
ashtray
in
the
best
way
peaty
however
thats
in
the
secondary
perhaps
muted
over
time
aged
in
a
bottle
in
that
way
stands
out
from
classic
smoked
beers
lacy
with
a
bit
of
head
middling
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
o
it
grew
on
me
a
little
toward
the
end
but
this
is
one
hardcore
smoked
beer
absolutely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
is
aptly
named
it
gets
so
smoky
that
it
really
does
call
to
mind
a
full
ash
tray
evil
twin
went
a
little
overboard
with
this
one
youll
really
need
to
love
smoked
beers
to
justify
the
10
single
bottle
price
tag
and
the
ensuing
borderline
masochistic
palate
stomp
poured
into
an
elysian
snifter
pours
pitch
black
with
a
healthy
three
finger
medium
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
dark
toasted
malt
chocolate
and
peat
flavor
starts
with
a
healthy
dose
of
campfire
smoke
developing
dark
toasted
malt
coffee
nuts
and
peat
finishes
with
great
lingering
smoke
dark
toasted
malt
and
light
vanilla
medium
creamy
body
this
is
definitely
the
most
complex
smoke
flavor
ive
experienced
in
smoked
beer
and
although
i
am
not
a
cigar
smoker
the
flavor
does
suggest
the
rich
leathery
smoke
from
cigars
the
ashtray
moniker
is
appropriate
but
the
stout
gives
more
of
a
suggestion
of
the
smoke
before
the
stogie
gets
to
the
ashtray
well
done
and
very
enjoyable
evil
twin
pulls
off
another
beer
that
pushes
the
envelope
and
triumphs
overallreally
smokey
but
doesnt
linger
well
balanced
for
me
a
must
try
if
you
like
this
style
d
really
smoky
but
oddly
drinkable
the
peat
is
intense
but
not
unpleasant
or
bandaid
like
as
it
is
in
so
many
other
beers
a
generally
wellrendered
ris
not
too
sweet
or
boozy
but
instead
of
course
smoky
the
effect
isnt
overpowering
but
it
does
cast
a
spell
over
the
proceedings
all
constituent
components
seem
to
be
touched
by
it
if
you
like
that
idea
then
have
at
er
and
to
readdress
the
marketing
schtick
from
the
bottle
label
placebo
is
just
a
soso
90s
indie
band
man
d
nice
smoked
stout
good
overall
balance
with
good
body
and
mouthfeel
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
the
stout
was
a
murky
blackishbrown
with
a
slight
layer
of
mocha
foam
the
smoke
is
very
apparent
in
the
aroma
as
it
radiates
the
essence
of
smoked
bacon
in
the
initial
taste
one
gets
sweet
bacon
smoke
glazed
ham
and
sweet
black
malt
if
you
are
bored
with
the
average
stout
this
stout
sure
packs
a
great
deal
of
excitement
toward
the
finish
one
detects
elements
of
vanilla
toward
the
back
of
the
tongue
if
the
sweetness
on
this
stout
went
a
little
higher
this
would
be
near
perfect
in
the
aftertaste
a
woody
vanilla
finish
yields
to
a
warming
sensation
a
nice
smooth
stout
that
leaves
some
of
the
sting
of
tobacco
in
your
mouth
ashtray
heart
would
make
a
great
cold
weather
beer
wah
poured
this
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
massive
tan
foamy
frothy
fluffy
creamy
head
that
settles
after
a
bit
and
some
lace
color
is
an
opaque
black
brown
aroma
is
smoke
malt
molasses
a
little
red
wine
flavor
is
the
disappointment
a
little
sour
i
believe
its
turned
and
hard
to
get
around
it
otherwise
its
like
nose
plenty
of
bitter
and
the
sweet
is
offset
by
the
sour
body
is
good
i
think
but
again
the
sour
leave
high
points
that
i
dont
think
would
normally
be
there
finish
is
like
flavor
and
i
cant
drink
anymore
o
eh
this
was
boring
at
best
totally
opposite
of
the
delicious
and
complex
biscotti
break
from
evil
twin
o
the
head
is
amazing
with
an
interesting
blend
of
smoke
and
malt
with
a
bit
of
an
odd
bitterness
the
black
malt
and
roasted
barley
has
a
strong
brassy
flavor
this
gets
a
bit
to
strong
as
it
warms

o
several
evil
twin
beers
deep
now
im
starting
to
feel
that
these
guys
are
talented
brewers
but
are
extreme
for
the
sake
of
being
extreme
after
a
couple
of
expensive
purchases
and
not
being
too
thrilled
with
any
of
them
its
going
to
take
a
great
experience
with
an
inexpensive
draft
pour
to
get
me
back
as
a
consumer
o
i
like
this
its
different
for
sure
but
dont
think
i
will
seek
this
out
again
thats
not
saying
i
dont

evil
twin
purchased
on
a
recent
trip
to
st
louis
best
by
2015
printed
on
the
label
poured
from
330ml
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
dark
with
a
faint
tan
head
which
quickly
recedes
leaving
only
some
bubbles
s
roasted
malts
with
the
usual
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
the
smokiness
comes
through
on
the
aroma
t
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
with
the
smokiness
also
coming
through
on
the
taste
m
light
to
medium
body
with
little
carbonation
a
nice
beer
i
can
imagine
the
smokiness
being
nice
for
a
beer
pairing
with
food
not
your
average
stout
overall
its
a
slightly
adventurous
brew
that
im
ultimately
glad
i
tried
but
i
dont
think
id
be
anxious
to
pick
it
up
again
any
time
soon
just
a
bit
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
for
my
tastes
based
on
the
price
its
pretty
tough
for
me
to
recommend
this
one
it
is
a
solid
big
stout
with
a
light
to
moderate
amount
of
smoke
i
do
love
the
name
though
served
from
bottle
into
a
unibroue
la
fin
du
monde
tulip
poured
pitch
black
with
a
minimal
light
tan
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
charred
malt
smoke
and
subtle
dark
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
smoke
dark
chocolate
and
charred
malt
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
very
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
if
i
am
completely
honest
i
never
would
have
guessed
that
this
one
was
a
ris
by
smelling
it
or
tasting
it
alone
now
that
i
know
it
is
some
of
the
flavors
i
got
make
a
little
sense
dark
fruit
while
this
was
pretty
good
it
was
just
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
liking
with
the
charred
malt
flavor
i
got
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
for
sure
despite
this
fact
rich
aroma
is
strongly
smoky
with
undertones
of
coffee
and
molasses
and
a
hint
of
caramel
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
sable
with
a
very
thick
finebubbled
and
rather
persistent
tan
head
smoky
flavor
has
notes
of
molasses
burnt
wood
fine
roast
coffee
and
licorice
fullbodied
texture
is
smooth
and
just
a
little
fizzy
not
the
best
imperial
stout
i
have
ever
had
but
definitely
a
worthy
one
overall
this
is
what
i
expected
and
not
bad
at
all
i
dont
think
i
could
have
done
much
more
than
a
small
pour
due
to
the
intensity
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
think
the
idea
was
exciting
combining
heavy
woody
smoke
with
the
sweet
moments
of
a
milk
stout
sadly
the
execution
doesnt
match
the
brilliance
of
the
idea
bottle
shared
at
the
september
iteration
of
the
santa
cruz
tasting
series
pours
black
with
clear
red
corners
and
a
cocoa
head
peaty
chocolatey
aroma
sweet
and
moussey
flavor
is
wellbalanced
with
equal
parts
dark
chocolate
sugary
coffee
and
smokey
meat
with
a
boozy
bitter
finish
not
a
very
aggressive
stout
subdued
overall
but
a
good
blend
of
flavors
notes
all
hype
aside
this
is
quite
a
good
brew
well
see
about
the
other
offerings
given
that
it
rides
somewhat
on
mikkellers
rep
it
has
a
tough
road
ahead
to
make
a
significant
dent
once
the
new
distribution
launch
settles
the
overblown
pricing
despite
the
solid
quality
will
hinder
the
choice
it
is
good
but
not
that
price
bracket
good
o
the
beer
has
some
interesting
flavors
but
isnt
one
that
is
easy
to
drink
with
the
flavors
of
cigar
smoke
o
i
would
actually
liked
more
smoke
on
this
one
but
not
all
that
bad
the
vinous
notes
detract
from
the
beer
imo
not
a
bad
ris
but
nothing
great
very
tightly
constructed
and
a
pleasure
to
consume
this
is
prime
material
for
a
dessert
beer
andor
to
accompany
a
good
cigar
this
is
a
different
one
maybe
worth
trying
but
the
price
point
gets
a
little
tough
part
of
my
smokefiend
find
in
chitown
last
week
got
some
it
pours
a
straight
onyx
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
sienna
foam
the
nose
comprises
molasses
red
wine
light
maple
syrup
roasted
malts
smoked
hickory
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
syrup
oh
yeah
baby
the
taste
starts
off
with
plenty
of
roasted
malts
molasses
and
dark
chocolate
then
moves
into
a
woody
slightly
vinous
smoke
which
melds
with
the
molasses
and
red
wine
as
it
lingers
in
the
finish
the
wine
is
a
bit
much
for
me
as
it
detracts
from
the
more
straightforward
smoke
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
lightly
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
smoked
stout
one
that
stands
apart
from
its
ilk
due
to
the
hickory
and
wine
characters
good
times
overall
i
bought
two
of
these
and
probably
wont
buy
any
more
i
will
throw
the
second
one
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
and
see
if
the
flavor
changes
for
the
better
o
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
like
smoked
stouts
you
will
likely
dig
this
one
but
might
not
opt
for
it
again
the
aroma
is
excellent
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
come
together
for
me
interesting
beer
but
not
my
favorite
this
was
okay
ill
have
to
try
another
less
polarizing
style
from
evil
twin
i
could
imagine
smoked
beer
fans
loving
this
o
an
interesting
drinkable
and
oddly
likable
beer
complex
creamy
and
incredibly
well
puttogether
worth
a
try
for
sure
a
super
solid
tasty
smoked
dips
a
well
crafted
stout
with
well
hidden
alcohol
not
the
type
of
smoke
i
was
expecting
to
see
however
overall
still
a
great
offering
from
evil
twin
o
pilsners
are
a
dime
a
dozen
but
quality
pilsners
are
not
even
without
the
smoke
component
this
is
an
interesting
flavorful
satisfying
beer
standing
out
partly
because
it
is
unfiltered
the
smoke
adds
additional
complexity
very
good
there
is
some
light
smoke
on
the
nose
but
it
is
not
schlenkerla
or
even
spezial
intensity
pours
hazy
gold
under
a
2
finely
bubbled
white
foam
collar
a
very
creamy
palate
with
rich
malt
flavors
light
smoke
preceding
a
herbal
dry
finish
medium
body
and
a
very
fine
soft
carbonation
that
is
short
of
prickly
its
a
good
beer
but
it
could
use
a
touch
more
smoke
i
have
not
had
much
smoked
pils
this
is
only
the
second
or
third
i
can
recall
but
its
probably
my
favorite
of
the
lot
its
less
smoke
heavy
not
so
rauch
and
german
and
intense
and
campfire
based
its
a
pils
first
and
a
smoked
beer
second
which
lets
the
light
grain
still
be
light
and
the
mouthfeel
not
smolder
into
something
much
heavier
than
the
style
asks
for
just
a
slightly
brown
hue
to
the
golden
beer
but
definitely
more
hazy
than
most
pilsener
beers
out
there
the
head
is
small
but
easily
resurrected
with
a
whirl
of
the
glass
the
nose
and
taste
both
show
some
sweetness
not
as
dry
as
others
and
the
lager
yeast
is
totally
lost
along
with
the
crisp
finish
it
usually
brings
the
smoke
as
light
as
it
is
here
still
drags
it
on
quite
a
ways
in
the
finish
woody
as
it
is
smoky
i
like
that
and
i
still
taste
all
the
grain
which
is
really
fresh
carbonation
is
high
even
though
the
beer
looks
flat
a
combination
of
two
styles
i
dont
unconditionally
love
but
this
is
a
great
beer
very
well
balanced
for
what
it
is
and
as
good
in
terms
of
overall
quality
as
we
all
now
expect
out
of
evil
twin
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
which
may
be
the
greatest
testament
to
its
appeal
o
fantastic
i
wish
i
had
bought
a
sixer
of
this
one
you
could
drink
easily
in
a
session
with
friends
prost
o
this
is
a
really
interesting
lager
i
doubt
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
but
i
could
see
myself
reaching
for
a
beer
like
this
when
i
wanted
something
tasty
and
relatively
unique
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
pilsner
but
the
smoke
component
is
pretty
much
missinginaction
i
would
give
this
a
higher
score
for
a
pilsner
3
75
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
more
prominent
smoke
aspect
you
wont
find
it
here
so
therefore
a
relatively
low
score
as
a
whole
the
beer
doesnt
taste
bad
and
some
people
will
probably
be
content
with
it
but
it
just
doesnt
serve
up
what
i
want
in
either
a
smoked
beer
or
a
pils
something
a
german
texan
might
really
love
nice
job
choosing
the
name
a
really
nice
smoked
beer
with
a
kinda
rough
aftertaste
that
invites
urges
you
to
take
another
sip
12oz
bottle
with
btld
042214
stamped
on
the
neck
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
looks
like
an
ipa
basically
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
smokey
with
some
meat
and
cherry
wood
aromas
some
booze
and
maybe
even
some
apricots
the
taste
is
lots
of
smoke
charred
wood
cherry
and
malts
very
woody
and
earthy
finishes
with
some
more
wood
and
smoked
malts
some
floral
hop
notes
medium
bodied
with
not
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
overall
solid
smoked
beer
id
certainly
buy
again
not
quite
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
rauchbiers
but
a
smoked
pilsner
is
an
intriguing
take
on
the
style
one
of
the
lighter
smoked
beers
ive
had
nothing
spectacular
but
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
cool
style
and
punch
given
to
the
ordinary
pilsner
but
its
flavor
profile
isnt
overwhelming
and
still
stays
firmly
in
the
pilsner
territory
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
thought
the
smoke
would
come
into
play
more
but
its
wellbalanced
and
tasty
regardless
evil
twin
succeeds
very
well
at
making
unique
and
surprising
beers
while
keeping
them
balanced
and
drinkable
overall
this
beer
does
seem
to
be
just
a
bitter
pilsner
with
hints
of
smoke
really
wanted
more
smoke
but
i
did
enjoy
it
regardless
surprising
to
see
such
a
clean
golden
color
from
the
beer
the
notions
of
smoke
evokes
images
of
brown
beer
its
modest
haze
and
cottony
froth
never
lets
the
eye
in
on
its
darker
and
rewarding
secrets
within
overall
a
pretty
solid
twist
on
a
pilsener
the
smoke
adds
an
interesting
kick
without
overwhelming
the
soft
pils
malt
notes
smoky
light
in
color
and
relatively
foamy
smell
is
definitely
smoky
with
some
light
maltiness
in
the
background
pilsner
flavor
is
there
but
overpowered
by
the
bitterness
of
the
smoke
i
dig
it
although
if
youre
not
into
rauchbiers
or
smoke
you
wont
like
this
overall
a
very
pleasant
surprise
look
forward
to
trying
the
ashtray
heart
now
a
refreshing
pilsner
with
an
interesting
hint
of
smoked
malt
overall
i
like
smoked
beers
so
picked
up
one
of
these
as
evil
twin
just
started
distribution
in
minnesota
not
a
very
good
first
impression
kind
of
a
mixed
bag
taste
with
only
a
hint
of
smoke
flavor
easy
to
drink
appealing
to
people
that
normally
dont
drink
pilsners
because
theyre
boring
aka
me
this
is
full
of
flavor
and
although
it
seems
absurd
to
have
a
sweet
hoppy
smoky
beer
all
in
one
it
works
and
it
works
well
overall
i
wasnt
even
in
the
mood
for
this
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
its
definitely
not
something
id
want
more
than
once
though
o
a
decent
beer
the
smoke
tends
to
overpower
the
other
flavors
still
worth
trying
the
smoked
taste
and
the
light
carbonated
style
was
very
balanced
for
me
edit
having
now
read
some
of
the
reviews
below
describing
the
smoke
flavor
as
light
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
fairly
subdued
smoke
qualities
and
an
interesting
citrus
presence
that
i
wasnt
expecting

enough
to
provide

of

is

fine
light
white
head
with
great
persistence
and
lacing
light
aroma
of
smoke
very
smoky
probably
one
of
port
citys
best
beers
but
not
one
for
everyone
body
is
black
with
minimal
head
like
a
porterstout
but
blindfolded
this
couldve
been
a
rauchbier
for
all
i
knew
bc
it
smells
so
smoky
and
meaty
probably
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
gives
it
away
i
really
like
the
smokinessgaminess
of
beer
and
i
dont
eat
meat
at
all
mind
you
which
is
heavy
on
tongue
but
completely
overpowering
this
allows
for
a
mellow
balance
that
gives
off
just
enough
sweetness
to
counter
the
meat
flavor
without
compromising
the
smoke
aspects
of
the
beer
an
enjoyable
beer
that
nicely
blends
two
different
styles
an
extremely
well
done
imperial
stout
serving
type
ontap
very
good
overall
but
not
true
to
the
style
at
first
i
as
disappointed
but
having
thought
about
it
this
is
a
great
marketing
beer
and
way
to
introduce
people
to
the
style
overall
just
a
solid
beer
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
will
definitely
seek
this
out
on
tap
at
rustico
in
alexandria
served
in
a
snifter
pours
near
black
nose
is
far
too
smokey
and
meaty
smoked
herring
some
roast
underneath
flavor
is
similar
but
more
intense
on
the
smoke
a
bit
more
background
beer
as
it
warms
but
i
just
couldnt
get
into
this
one
on
tap
at
3
floyds
smokey
aroma
very
smokey
flavors
first
beer
like
this
but
not
to
big
of
a
fan
of
the
smoked
malt
its
got
a
nice
bitterness
my
girlfriend
likes
it
more
than
i
do
to
much
like
smoke
flavors
smoky
and
spicy
with
some
yeast
esters
and
fresh
cracked
grains
overall
i
like
this
one
a
lot
but
even
i
start
getting
bored
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
think
the
beer
itself
gets
bored
with
me
because
it
loses
interest
in
tasting
the
same
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
not
something
i
would
crave
however
o
not
bad
but
not
as
interesting
as
the
rauches
of
the
motherland
at
first
the
brain
tells
the
palate
that
this
will
be
a
slow
session
to
weather
but
the
16oz
glass
is
empty
within
fifteen
minutes
the
savory
aroma
and
taste
of
the
beer
coupled
with
mediumlight
textures
make
it
highly
drinkable
3102012
on
tap
at
the
revolution
brewpub
in
chicago
this
unique
brew
is
a
slightly
hazed
copper
color
with
a
thin
but
very
sturdy
light
oatmeal
colored
head
that
leaves
a
perfect
wall
of
lacing
the
aroma
lives
up
to
the
billing
with
heavy
grilled
smoked
ham
idea
with
wheatymalt
rye
easily
worth
the
price
of
admission
the
flavor
gives
me
sweet
smoked
ham
and
herbal
hops
i
pick
up
on
some
pineapple
and
sprucey
hop
qualities
this
is
solidly
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
for
a
somewhat
sticky
feel
the
hop
infusion
here
is
just
awesome
and
this
is
a
true
keeper
three
floyd
ya
dun
it
again
had
on
tap
at
owen
and
engine
the
restaurant
has
a
great
old
english
pub
feel
and
this
beer
is
very
appropriate
for
that
setting
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
short
head
that
has
great
retention
leaves
great
lacing
could
use
a
bit
of
a
larger
head
but
this
beer
is
very
good
looking
aroma
is
mild
but
it
is
very
reminiscent
of
smokey
beef
jerky
and
rawhide
flavor
is
bacon
all
the
way
dry
smokey
bacon
rind
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
there
is
a
mild
fruity
quality
to
the
smoke
which
is
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
but
the
carbonation
is
pretty
on
point
very
nice
smoke
beer
from
fff
yum
would
have
again
and
again
i
have
seen
this
on
draft
only
twice
would
put
it
in
my
top
10
of
all
time
and
wish
it
was
around
more
my
score
is
higher
than
most
since
smoke
beers
are
among
my
favorites
not
for
all
but
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
the
bomb
a
good
one
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
definitely
come
back
to
this
beer
again
everything
is
balanced
and
seems
to
fit
well
together
plenty
o
hullabaloo
surrounding
this
beer
lets
hope
its
worthy
it
pours
a
clear
copperbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
beech
smoke
honey
molasses
ham
straight
up
brown
sugar
and
light
black
pepper
damn
does
this
smell
tasty
the
taste
holds
notes
of
honeybaked
ham
very
light
smoke
rye
bread
and
a
touch
of
what
seems
like
swiss
cheese
at
the
end
honestly
this
thing
tastes
very
similar
to
a
ham
sammy
on
rye
wow
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
oily
greasily
slick
feel
overall
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
if
it
werent
for
the
kind
of
awkward
feel
this
would
be
a
truly
exceptional
enjoyable
brew
get
some
o
this
beer
is
a
very
sublime
entry
into
the
smoked
beer
canon
i
actually
prefer
the
more
obtuse
versions
like
the
fastenbier
in
my
other
hand
but
i
respect
this
brew
for
its
rare
sophistication
in
a
very
blunt
genre
interesting
lots
of
interesting
flavors
rounded
nice
smoked
ham
light
rye
herbal
hops
are
a
little
iffy
though
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
easydrinking
smoked
beer
alcohol
is
wellhidden
its
less
intense
than
the
schlenkerla
beers
which
makes
it
easier
to
have
multiple
glasses
o
wow
this
beer
is
out
of
this
world
the
only
downfall
of
this
beer
is
that
a
full
16oz
is
a
bit
much
at
first
this
was
my
dads
favorite
beer
of
the
night
he
couldnt
believe
it
so
i
traded
him
for
his
gumballhead
i
noticed
after
awhile
he
wasnt
drinking
it
much
anymore
i
asked
what
was
up
and
he
said
he
loves
it
but
it
was
just
too
much
so
we
traded
back
and
then
it
was
hard
for
me
to
finish
anyway
its
a
great
beer
but
a
sipper
and
something
to
enjoy
in
small
quantities
i
really
appreciate
what
fff
did
here
and
the
score
is
fairly
high
because
it
is
one
of
the
best
specialty
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
think
it
truly
is
masterfully
crafted
to
taste
how
it
does
overall
i
was
really
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
tastes
kind
of
liked
smokes
meat
just
what
you
want
out
of
a
good
smoked
beer
the
sweetness
complemented
the
smoke
well
ive
enjoyed
few
beers
with
names
as
descriptive
as
ham
on
rye
its
just
as
flavorful
and
tasty
as
the
sandwich
very
interesting
it
blows
my
mind
how
much
like
ham
this
stuff
tastes
well
worth
a
try
just
for
the
experience
but
i
wouldnt
buy
copious
amounts
of
this
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
its
not
bad
by
any
means
just
very
very
different
i
had
no
problem
putting
this
one
down
and
laughing
my
ass
off
about
how
it
tastes
like
a
ham
sandwich
i
dont
think
id
drink
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
though
definitely
the
meatiest
tasting
smoked
beer
i
have
had
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
maybe
im
just
on
a
cured
meat
kick
but
it
tastes
like
a
sandwich
a
nice
change
from
anything
sweet
d
a
pretty
interesting
smoked
beer
i
thought
there
was
more
smoke
and
meat
in
the
flavor
than
the
nose
not
the
smokiest
ive
bad
but
pretty
enjoyable
and
glad
i
got
to
try
it
beer
is
thinner
than
expected
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
rye
though
it
has
a
nice
smokiness
to
it
decent
but
ultimately
flat
one
note
flavor
one
of
my
least
favorite
three
floyds
beers
to
date
but
i
would
have
it
again
on
draft
if
possible
i
tried
this
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
this
pours
a
translucent
brownish
dirty
amber
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
smell
is
of
weak
ham
for
a
smoked
beer
i
expected
a
little
more
there
isnt
much
pork
to
it
and
the
smoke
is
really
subtle
it
tastes
of
a
ham
sandwhich
on
rye
as
i
guess
it
should
but
its
not
really
that
impressive
i
expected
the
flavors
to
be
more
bold
it
drank
smoothly
and
was
pretty
light
in
body
this
beer
wasnt
anything
too
special
but
im
glad
i
could
try
it
the
beer
appears
a
golden
amber
hue
with
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
upon
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
smoke
and
smoked
malt
i
dont
think
i
could
single
out
ham
per
se
but
i
could
get
a
sense
of
smoked
meat
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
decent
and
follows
the
aroma
i
didnt
enjoy
this
brew
nearly
as
much
as
my
favorite
authentic
rauchbiers
but
it
was
good
nonetheless
the
body
was
a
tad
thin
for
my
liking
a
fun
beer
i
would
have
it
again
dvery
dinkable
i
dont
even
need
food
job
well
done
such
an
odd
brew
but
really
tasty
im
shocked
and
amazed
pours
a
moderate
redamber
color
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
before
falling
and
not
leaving
too
much
behind
the
nose
brings
some
lightlysmoked
malt
along
with
a
bit
of
roastedyou
guessed
itham
there
is
a
bit
of
bready
malt
there
as
well
taste
doesnt
quite
bring
home
the
bacon
like
i
would
have
liked
though
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
the
base
malt
seemed
to
take
up
too
much
of
the
flavor
medium
body
with
a
slightlysmokey
finish
a
good
brew
but
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
nose
drinkability
coming
into
this
beer
i
thought
it
would
be
an
interesting
novelty
however
this
turned
out
to
be
my
favorite
rye
beer
to
date
lots
of
complexity
coming
from
the
grist
with
spicy
rye
woodsmoke
and
roast
malt
well
balanced
but
still
keeps
one
at
attention
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
try
this
dont
hesitate
or
you
will
live
to
regret
your
poor
decision
d
this
was
a
couple
and
done
beer
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
for
the
fact
that
it
tasted
like
it
was
suppose
too
smoked
beers
i
like
but
only
a
couple
pints
please
d
the
strangeness
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
one
you
should
definitely
try
on
a
must
try
beer
at
least
once
if
youre
ever
visiting
fff
pours
a
clear
and
visibly
highly
carbonated
brown
color
with
a
thin
and
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
vague
but
gives
off
hints
of
sweet
malty
grain
the
taste
is
also
sweet
and
a
touch
of
grain
with
a
subtle
background
of
smoke
the
body
is
medium
and
very
drinkable
but
the
brew
is
slightly
tart
from
beginning
to
end
the
finish
is
slow
and
sees
an
slight
increase
in
tartness
and
smokiness
and
both
of
which
linger
after
the
end
dhad
another
after
my
first
glass
and
could
have
easily
had
more
if
not
pressed
for
time
figured
itd
be
a
rye
since
well
thats
in
the
name
didnt
expect
the
smoke
even
though
i
should
have
my
one
complaint
is
that
this
isnt
nearly
smoky
enoughit
tastes
a
little
meaty
but
when
you
get
a
big
big
rauch
it
actually
tastes
like
a
hickory
farms
sampler
id
never
thought
i
say
this
but
if
three
floyds
had
just
been
a
little
more
bold
then
this
beer
would
have
been
great
mouth
is
a
little
light
and
thin
yet
good
carbonation
easy
rinker
it
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
appearance
was
a
medium
color
of
brown
with
a
small
head
that
faded
away
quickly
smell
was
great
taste
was
good
it
was
served
too
cold
for
my
liking
more
of
an
establishment
critique
the
high
amounts
of
smoked
malt
were
a
somewhat
too
harsh
on
my
mouth
but
still
pretty
drinkable
despite
the
smoke
i
was
very
excited
when
i
saw
this
on
the
tap
list
and
am
glad
to
say
it
was
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
its
making
me
appreciate
and
seek
out
some
more
smoke
beers
since
their
flavor
profiles
are
always
a
unique
one
d
good
but
not
earth
shattering
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
im
glad
we
were
able
to
but
ill
probably
pass
on
it
next
time
i
see
it
had
this
on
tap
poured
into
pint
glass
amber
body
with
with
minimal
light
tan
head
smells
smokey
like
smoked
cheese
with
some
spicy
mustard
taste
follows
the
nose
smokey
bready
malt
and
spice
this
brew
is
aptly
named
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smoky
finish
i
had
to
try
this
for
the
name
alone
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
could
not
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
would
get
one
again
and
i
think
my
appreciation
would
grow
from
increased
exposure
to
this
style
d
a
solid
beer
w
serious
rye
flavor
i
am
always
looking
for
new
rye
ales
to
try
and
was
very
happy
to
try
this
one
a
very
drinkable
beer
highly
recommended
d
i
debated
having
something
else
after
my
first
glass
but
realized
that
it
was
too
good
and
i
must
have
more
a
nicely
smoked
ale
d
aptly
named
ham
on
rye
is
an
awesome
smoked
rye
beer
that
virtually
duplpicates
eating
drinking
a
sandwich
fff
manages
to
push
the
envelope
yet
again
with
a
beer
that
could
have
been
simply
a
novelty
but
turned
out
to
be
fantastic
d
not
something
i
would
reach
for
often
but
i
would
like
to
come
across
this
again
dwell
i
am
not
going
to
lie
to
youi
am
a
devotee
of
smoked
beers
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
in
any
way
mmm
mmm
the
spicy
aspect
works
really
well
and
turns
this
rather
mundane
smoked
amber
into
a
work
of
art
ham
on
ryetrue
that
well
done
fff
and
piece
d
overall
this
one
lives
up
to
its
name
but
i
could
not
drink
more
then
one
of
these
due
to
its
sweetness
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
great
dark
amber
color
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ever
it
obviously
smells
very
smoky
definitely
like
smoked
meat
great
malt
leaves
you
feeling
kinda
thirsty
you
definitely
need
a
glass
of
water
after
this
has
a
very
thin
head
leaves
good
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
i
would
pay
good
money
to
see
this
on
tap
again
at
fff
they
really
had
to
cut
back
on
some
excellent
brews
once
the
economy
tanked
i
feel
their
pain
but
damn
they
need
to
brew
this
one
again
drinkability
is
great
as
rauchbeers
go
it
is
difficult
to
produce
a
brew
that
is
this
smokey
and
also
provides
a
malt
backbone
that
works
well
with
the
smoke
this
accomplishes
that
to
some
degree
but
it
could
be
better
cheers
this
beer
is
one
you
have
to
talk
about
you
know
that
beer
you
get
your
friends
to
try
you
either
love
it
or
you
hate
i
loved
it
going
to
have
to
get
a
growler
to
take
back
to
experiment
with
some
beer
buddies
overall
simply
delicious
this
has
now
replaced
black
sun
stout
as
my
favorite
three
floyds
beer
please
for
the
love
of
god
start
bottling
this
ill
figure
out
how
to
get
it
into
pa
after
that
this
is
a
rauchbier
and
meant
to
be
intensely
smoky
the
authors
of
low
reviews
here
dont
seem
to
be
aware
that
this
is
a
legitimate
beer
style
d
they
serve
it
in
an
imperial
could
easily
be
served
in
a
12
pint
in
which
they
serve
most
of
their
big
beers
uniquely
enjoyable
but
not
one
to
be
sessioned
no
big
deal
though
these
guys
have
earned
the
right
to
experiment
still
the
best
brewery
in
the
world
in
my
opinion
i
hate
to
give
fff
a
review
like
this
but
here
goes
i
did
not
like
this
brew
i
only
had
a
couple
sips
because
i
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
drink
anymore
than
that
its
seriously
like
a
piece
of
salt
ham
im
sure
thats
what
they
were
aiming
for
but
its
a
very
wierd
taste
unless
you
have
food
you
cant
drink
it
imho
taste
is
a
knockout
rye
with
a
good
malt
balance
and
i
suppose
some
hops
this
thing
really
tastes
and
smells
like
a
ham
sandwich
im
impressed
but
how
i
never
wanted
a
ham
sandwich
so
much
in
my
life
mild
carbonation
and
very
smooth
feels
a
little
thin
and
mild
not
sure
about
drinkability
just
due
to
the
massive
rye
one
suited
me
just
fine
this
needs
to
be
bottled
and
released
as
a
seasonal
beer
its
perfect
for
that
weekend
afternoon
in
the
fall
when
you
want
to
grill
a
big
fat
reuben
sandwich
for
a
football
game
d
a
beer
that
would
be
a
perfect
replacement
for
a
kielbasa
and
sauerkraut
meal
as
the
smoky
meat
taste
is
so
prevalent
on
the
whole
i
am
not
too
sure
as
to
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
it
is
good
and
interesting
and
accomplishes
its
goal
but
after
a
while
it
started
to
get
old
and
a
bit
too
much
for
me
the
greasy
meat
aftertaste
started
to
wear
on
me
and
really
had
no
desire
to
have
another
on
the
whole
i
would
say
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
but
not
one
that
i
would
try
again
after
having
the
experience
once
this
beer
is
very
unique
and
the
salts
adds
a
very
interesting
mouthfeeltaste
tried
this
beer
during
a
small
beer
tasting
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
smoked
and
peaty
beer
the
beer
looked
and
smelled
fine
but
for
a
smoked
beer
it
was
beyond
bitter
and
didnt
seem
to
go
together
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
even
though
smoked
beer
isnt
my
favorite
style
this
was
just
doing
it
for
me
and
my
friends
at
the
tasting
tasted
like
peat
and
brine
o
one
of
those
ales
that
throws
a
couple
of
seemingly
disparate
elements
at
you
all
at
once
the
rauchbier
base
is
appropriately
smoky
malts
are
dense
but
clean
and
offer
a
mildly
roasty
background
for
the
peatiness
and
brininess
bourbonbarrel
aging
it
somehow
made
it
tastes
like
ale
that
had
been
aged
in
some
islay
cask
but
the
bourbon
barrel
every
now
and
again
slid
a
vanillalike
syrupy
maple
flavor
through
the
sip
interesting
ale
probably
be
hitormiss
for
many
taken
as
a
singular
entity
in
the
beer
world
a
really
nice
drink
to
spend
some
time
with
theres
a
pretty
good
balance
of
smoke
and
bourbon
and
the
caramel
malt
backbone
helps
meld
the
two
wish
the
smoke
werent
so
plasticy
mid
palate
but
make
n
o
mistake
about
it
the
ale
is
sharp
smoky
and
earthy
ideally
suited
as
a
complement
for
all
those
smokehouse
menu
items
thats
served
up

thank
you
to
the
brewery
for
providing
that
info
on
the
can
nose
was
smoky
but
not
as
intense
as
i
might
have
liked
it
had
a
smoked
gouda
cheeselike
odor
which
may
not
make
it
a
good
fit
for
some
people
for
me
it
was
great
i
broke
out
the
cheese
and
crackers
and
took
my
first
sip
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
kind
of
dense
but
not
quite
to
the
point
of
being
thick
the
taste
was
nice
slightly
bitter

with
a
smokiness
that
was
at
the
low
end
for
me
but
probably
at

peoples
upper
limit
i
have
to
admit
that
i
did
not
perceive
the
fruity
esters
that
the
can
mentioned
it
just
struck
me
as
a
smoky
beer
with
a
moderate
bitterness
finish
left
me
with
a
smoky
flavor
in
my
mouth
and
in
my
sinuses
believe
me
i
get
it
when
people
say
that
they
are
not
fans
of
the
style
i
just
look
at
it
as
more
for
me
and
those
of
us
who
do
like
it
i
would
not
want
a
steady
diet
of
it
either
this
was
my
second
smoked
beer
today
and
i
was
now
looking
forward
to
something

enjoyed
out
of
can
more
than
out
of
stein
i
had
this
beer
with
smoked
sausage
and
smoked
gouda
on
crackers
delicious
smokey
flavor
brought
me
back
to
the
rauchbiers
i
had
while
living
in
germany
recommended
overall
tho
its
an
enjoyable
beer
which
im
happy
to
say
i
have
three
more
tallboys
of
in
the
fridge
ill
try
more
cedar
creek
beers
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
smoked
alt
but
this
is
decently
good
its
pretty
much
a
rauchbier
with
almost
overpowering
campfire
smoke
from
the
beechwood
more
balance
and
a
thicker
mouthfeel
would
have
made
this
a
lot
better
this
is
an
interesting
beer
rauchbier
in
style
but
the
alt
partnership
is
a
weird
one
its
definitely
more
rauhbier
than
alt
im
glad
ive
tried
it
but
unless
im
really
in
need
of
a
smoky
beer
in
the
future
i
cant
see
myself
revisiting
this
too
much
very
often
not
a
bad
fallwinter
beer
though
c
on
the
whole
scruffys
smoked
alt
is
an
excellent
smoked
beer
it
incorporates
smokey
flavors
into
what
is
ultimately
a
crisp
drinkable
ale
the
can
tells
us
that
the
brewers
have
aimed
to
create
a
smoke
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
with
food
i
can
understand
why
the
flavor
of
most
rauchbiersmoked
beers
is
so
bold
that
any
attempt
to
pair
the
beers
with
food
ends
up
futile
the
smokiness
in
scruffys
smoked
alt
is
subdued
enough
that
the
beer
should
pair
well
with
acidic
and
rich
items
taste
is
well
done
on
the
smoke
just
enough
to
satisfy
rauchbier
fans
but
not
too
intense
as
to
scare
away
someone
who
has
not
tried
a
smoked
beer
before
the
malts
are
perfectly
done
for
my
tastes
lightly
toasty
but
stays
more
biscuity
with
a
bit
of
caramel
kiss
of
hops
rounds
things
out
nicely
the
smoke
is
not
intense
but
it
does
have
a
nice
meaty
flavor
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
and
is
another
solid
offering
from
cedar
creek
im
impressed
with
all
three
offerings
they
have
put
out
this
is
a
well
done
smoked
beer
the
meaty
smoke
is
very
present
but
does
not
over
power
everything
the
growler
will
be
gone
in
no
time
very
nice
this
smoked
alt
is
a
good
beer
for
drinking
with
barbecued
meats
on
a
hot
texas
day
it
isnt
an
easy
beer
to
find
but
it
is
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
the
subtlety
of
the
smoke
flavor
makes
it
easy
drinking
enough
that
most
anyone
will
find
it
agreeable
and
likeable
the
beer
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
smoke
in
it
as
well
as
a
hint
of
toffee
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
the
meaty
smoke
really
comes
through
strongly
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
some
earth
from
the
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
ok
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
robust
even
so
if
you
like
your
beers
smoky
without
being
a
fullon
rauchbiertype
thing
then
this
is
worth
a
look
doubly
so
if
you
like
stouts
and
porters
even
if
it
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
worth
a
try
but
really
needs
more
body
more
alcohol
or
ideally
more
of
both
my
ratings
reflect
the
nature
of
the
beer
its
a
bit
all
over
the
place
but
not
necessarily
the
worse
for
it

flima0
overall
each
to
their
taste
but
i
love
this
this
porter
has
an
awesome
appearance
its
head
could
be
classified
as
its
own
mountain
range
i
actually
had
to
wait
on
it
to
settle
a
bit
to
finish
the
pour
when
a
beer
starts
with
a
nice
chunky
head
that
holds
is
shape
for
quite
a
long
while
it
has
to
be
pretty
good
it
is
good
but
for
a
smoked
porter
i
could
use
a
little
more
smoke
i
have
to
admit
i
added
some
points
just
because
it
is
smoked
porter
in
a
can
it
was
on
the
rack
at
the
mixed
6
pack
area
at
harris
teeter
it
opened
with
a
perfect
pop
sound
poured
to
beautiful
head
head
retained
nicely
i
think
the
beer
was
a
little
cold
initially
as
i
had
left
it
outside
in
13
degree
night
wind
for
too
long
it
was
initially
bitter
which
i
think
is
a
product
of
the
peat
smoked
malt
my
palette
adjusted
as
it
warmed
up
and
we
met
together
in
a
smile
of
enjoyment
not
too
smokey
carbonation
was
brisk
and
enjoyable
i
think
a
little
more
malt
back
bone
would
be
enjoyable
it
seemed
a
tad
thin
at
times
on
the
feel
i
ate
a
piece
of
salmon
with
it
and
it
was
perfect
i
thought
i
was
back
in
juno
alaska
with
local
smoked
porter
and
salmon
meal
i
give
good
credit
that
the
smoke
was
not
over
done
not
a
smoke
bomb
the
flavor
profile
is
reasonable
in
intensity
lacks
complexity
and
is
not
well
balanced
it
lacks
the
flavor
depth
of
the
great
porters
and
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
as
a
result
it
does
deliver
a
nice
burst
of
smoke
from
the
peated
malt
that
is
oak
in
nature
and
serves
as
the
main
characteristic
it
lacks
a
balance
for
the
smoke
that
a
rich
dose
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
could
provide
also
absent
is
any
dark
fruit
character
a
nice
mild
bitterness
appears
in
the
middle
that
is
roast
and
hop
in
nature
the
finish
slowly
fades
with
smoke
and
notes
of
roast
overall
this
was
a
very
good
smoked
porter
recommended
a
winner
hope
to
try
more
from
the
brewery
easy
great
drinking
porter
with
a
smidgen
of
smokiness
big
fan
quest
did
a
fine
job
with
smoking
mirror
instead
of
obliterating
the
underlying
porter
with
smoke
this
beer
is
a
rich
malty
porter
with
mild
smokey
compliments
the
use
of
peat
ismoke
s
welcomed
too
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
love
to
try
the
porter
itself
without
the
peat
smoked
malt
seems
it
would
be
right
up
my
alley
thanks
again
wil
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
smoke
earth
dark
chocolate
cream
and
subtle
milk
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
smoke
toasted
malt
earth
spice
and
dark
chocolate
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with

carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
am
personally
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
as
they
always
remind
me
of
a
barbeque
this
one
was
no
exception
you
know
right
off
the
bat
that
it
is
a
smoked
brew
huge
notes
of
smoke
just
consume
you
once
you
investigate
this
brew
there
is
also
a
nice
sweet
balance
to
it
as
well
that
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
as
well
i
just
wish
that
on
the
flavor
some
of
the
earthiness
would
have
been
covered
up
with
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
more
and
take
it
to
another
level
still
a
very
good
brew
sit
down
and
enjoy
if
you
see
it
on
tap
around
tick
very
disappointed
with
this
one
the
smoke
felt
way
off
almost
like
the
smoke
came
from
old
bark
bitter
and
acrid
not
sure
how
the
beer
i
drank
got
100
from
the
bros
taste
and
smell
bad
overall
average
porter
this
is
a
black
thisll
brew
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
is
moderately
smokey
like
a
smoldering
campfire
and
a
roasted
malt
scent
underneath
balanced
medium
bitterness
some
smoke
beers
overdo
it
and
are
too
dry
and
acrid
this
brew
however
is
well
made
and
rewarding
o
its
a
pretty
solid
smoked
porter
if
i
could
get
this
regularly
here
in
las
vegas
i
think
i
would
probably
purchase
this
one
again

after

overall
this
is
a

good

darkbready

and
moderate
smoked

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
not
as
robust
or
smokey
in
the
flavor
as
i
had
hoped
for
but
nicely
enjoyable
otherwise
ok
im
a
fan
of
rauch
beers
and
porters
so
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
while
there
is
definitely
a
pleasant
amount
of
smokiness
in
this
beer
the
only
characteristics
of
a
porter
present
are
the
color
and
palate
perhaps
the
brewing
process
for
this
beer
has
changed
since
the
2004
award
or
perhaps
my
expectations
are
too
high
either
way
this
beer
is
mediocre
at
best
the
fizzy
completely
diminishing
head
detracts
from
the
appearance
and
my
enjoyment
of
this
offering
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
the
meaty
flavors
in
the
least
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
how
well
it
worked
i
would
have
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
overall
its
good
its
a
drinkable
porter
and
the
smoke
makes
it
interesting
overall
being
my
second
smoked
beer
ive
had
this
one
i
like
this
would
be
an
awesome
after
meal
drink
nothing
i
would
want
to
session
but
a
relaxation
brew
recommend
o
i
never
thought
i
would
find
myself
saying
i
regret
drinking
a
beer
but
alas
here
we
are
i
felt
sick
to
my
stomach
afterward
maybe
i
got
a
terrible
batch
as
others
seem
to
like
it
but
this
was
a
violent
assault
on
my
taste
buds
and
later
my
gi
tract
o
good
smoked
porter
just
wish
it
had
more
potency
in
the
flavor
o
this
is
not
your
average
smoked
parterit
has
a
strong
amount
of
smoked
peat
in
the
aromas
akin
to
something
you
would
expect
from
a
stronger
stout
o
a
rich
smoky
porter
that
will
work
great
with
beef
and
other
meats
overall
i
really
like
this
just
a
step
below
the
true
german
rauschbier
it
has
true
character
d
i
enjoyed
this
as
it
wasnt
overpoweringly
smoked
and
had
some
nice
balance
and
depth
to
it
theres
a
hint
of
a
diacetyl
that
might
bother
some
but
i
wasnt
particularly
bothered
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
but
a
beer
id
drink
again
why
did
i
wait
so
long
was
surprised
to
find
this
beer
in
ohio
but
glad
i
did
i
think
the
aroma
from
pouring
the
beer
into
the
glass
is
worth
it
alone
the
taste
is
just
so
full
of
flavor
but
the
smoke
aroma
doesnt
overpower
the
taste
when
i
totally
thought
that
it
was
going
to
i
do
alot
of
grilling
and
smoking
of
pork
shoulder
ribs
and
well
anything
that
you
might
want
to
eat
so
the
aroma
of
the
smoke
just
keeps
taking
me
back
to
my
last
time
that
i
had
the
smoker
fired
up
surprisingly
it
is
also
very
refreshing
as
well
as
smooth
as
others
have
described
it
as
having
a
meaty
feel
in
your
mouth
i
would
agree
this
ones
also
pretty
good
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
smooth
silky
texture
and
meaty
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
decent
head
retention
and
some
mediocre
lacing
patterns
its
got
that
salty
ham
smoke
going
on
in
spades
as
well
as
a
sludgey
molasses
glaze
sweetness
on
the
side
of
cigarette
ash
and
bitter
chocolate
unusually
beefy
beer
makes
you
want
to
sip
some
water
on
the
side
this
one
is
worth
finding
and
trying
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
aromas
of
bbq
and
some
coffee
taste
is
smokey
creamy
with
some
dark
bread
in
the
middle
and
a
piney
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
the
carbonation
levels
are
a
bit
low
overall
an
excellent
porter
that
i
would
get
again
great
brew
overall
ill
be
drinking
this
again
and
now
that
its
about
to
be
winter
probably
soon
its
available
in
several
places
in
my
area
and
for
the
price
of
a
couple
pints
at
the
bar
you
get
a
six
pack
i
think
this
is
pretty
decent
quality
stuff
try
it
if
you
like
porters
you
wont
be
disappointed
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
had
a
huge
smokey
aroma
though
one
could
detect
a
certain
sense
of
creaminess
in
the
aroma
to
say
the
least
the
smell
made
me
really
want
to
drink
this
one
the
appearance
was
a
murky
brownish
black
there
was
nothing
particularly
exciting
about
the
appearance
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
but
some
thickness
was
apparent
the
initial
taste
was
smokey
bacony
and
mildly
buttery
with
creaminess
in
other
words
the
beer
has
a
little
of
everything
that
is
bad
for
your
health
in
it
without
actually
including
it
at
the
risk
of
being
cliché
the
beer
was
uncommonly
smooth
for
a
porter
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
closer
to
a
milk
stout
with
a
little
less
thickness
the
pleasantry
continues
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
smokey
bacon
note
as
expected
there
is
little
carbonation
so
the
smokey
bacon
notes
hang
around
nicely
i
only
bought
one
bottle
of
this
at
the
liquor
store
but
will
probably
get
a
sixer
next
time
i
see
it
i
think
this
drinks
wonderfully
and
fits
the
bill
absolutely
perfectly
for
a
smoked
porter
ive
had
way
too
many
that
had
so
little
smoke
to
them
that
they
tasted
like
a
regular
porter
not
this
little
guy
the
smoke
is
there
but
as
mentioned
earlier
it
has
a
nice
balance
with
the
base
beer
wonderfully
done
and
i
will
be
a
returning
customer
to
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
14
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
strong
smoke
reminiscent
of
a
wood
fire
hops
pale
malt
slight
roasted
malt
and
hint
of
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
porter
but
wood
fit
into
the
smoked
beer
category
better
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
smoke
pale
malt
hint
of
hops
hint
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
yeast
and
a
hint
of
metallic
flavor
overall
the
body
is
mostly
smoke
first
then
nothing
else
arises
the
aroma
is
amazing
though
and
in
itself
would
make
this
worth
a
try
i
wish
the
body
could
more
closely
match
the
aroma
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
a
smoked
porter
both
the
porter
and
the
smoke
aspects
were
noticeable
while
being
nicely
balanced
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
for
a
smoked
beer
and
i
could
see
having
one
or
two
of
these
with
some
bbq
ribs
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
great
balance
it
had
and
the
awesome
aroma
they
made
this
beer
pretty
good
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
they
were
both
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
and
could
use
some
work
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
smoked
beer
that
it
not
too
smokey
it
was
nicely
priced
and
i
recommend
this
is
as
a
good
smoked
beer
for
beginners
this
is
the
third
beer
i
have
had
from
ofallon
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
their
cherry
chocolate
beer
but
i
liked
their
black
hemp
and
i
also
liked
this
beer
ill
be
looking
for
more
beers
from
them
good
job
guys
this
is
a
good
and
solid
smoker
porter
mine
had
a
different
label
and
said
made
in
stevens
point
wi
which
might
be
another
location
or
something
very
little
info
online
about
this
however
i
enjoyed
this
it
st
louis
as
a
local
beer
hmmmm
anyways
it
smells
like
a
campfire
almost
rauchbier
heavy
on
the
smoke
very
earthy
and
malty
but
somewhat
less
roasty
and
coffeechocolatey
as
i
expect
a
porter
to
be
flavor
is
totally
owned
by
the
smoke
which
is
a
good
thing
nice
sweeter
english
style
malts
back
it
up
but
again
there
is
this
strange
absence
of
dark
beer
flavors
its
somewhat
more
like
a
smokey
amber
or
something
rather
than
a
true
porter
feel
is
a
little
too
light
in
the
body
for
me
felt
watery
a
bit
due
to
lack
of
carbonation
with
a
better
feel
this
could
be
really
outstanding
the
flavor
is
great
but
it
also
isnt
a
porter
in
my
mind
not
enough
of
the
dark
rosted
malts
to
qualify
overall
a
pretty
good
style
jumper
worth
a
try
clear
dark
brown
in
color
mildly
translucent
forms
a
smallish
almost
tan
colored
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
very
light
lacing
aroma
is
unsurprisingly
dominated
by
the
scent
of
smoke
with
notes
of
heavily
roasted
malts
burnt
coffee
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
taste
is
much
of
the
same
mildly
sweet
dark
malts
smoke
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
vanilla
and
a
dry
campfire
astringency
on
the
finish
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
in
body
with
lighter
carbonation
mild
bitterness
overall
a
good
beer
that
improved
greatly
as
it
warmed
being
fairly
inexpensive
it
is
a
good
value
and
given
its
uniqueness
i
recommend
the
beer
and
intend
to
buy
it
again
i
was
expecting
a
bad
beer
but
i
got
something
average
and
drinkable
taste
is
definitely
woodsmoky
this
one
sweetens
and
mellows
as
it
warms
a
bit
quite
tasty

o
a
solid
beer
from
start
to
finish
seems
like
a
possible
infection
as
it
seems
like
a
shell
of
its
former
self
drinkability
the
assault
that
the
smoked
qualities
leave
in
your
mouth
make
this
something
that
i
would
avoid
drinking
multiples
of
it
is
not
offputting
but
the
smokiness
definitely
asserts
itself
jet
black
with
a
slight
tan
colored
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
skim
with
a
few
lazily
popping
bubbles
big
muscular
smokiness
with
a
definite
ham
and
bacon
quality
that
rivals
the
great
rauchbiers
of
germany
big
and
smoky
i
really
dig
the
smoke
effect
on
this
one
underlying
roasty
porter
flavors
are
crushed
by
the
mighty
smoke
a
think
a
bit
more
heft
would
make
this
beer
nearly
perfect
but
im
nitpicking
this
beer
is
a
smoke
lovers
delight
i
like
this
bold
flavored
beer
and
i
like
that
ofallon
didnt
play
it
safe
with
the
recipe
overall
an
easy
drinking
subtly
smoked
well
balanced
smoked
porter
overall
the
butterysweet
nature
of
this
beer
that
is
a
porter
first
with
smoke
qualities
make
it
quite
a
delight
to
drink
the
palate
could
be
a
little
more
complex
like
the
nose
but
regardless
this
is
a
damn
good
beer

this
beer
is
makes
me
happy
on
a
fall
day
this
beer
is
spot
on
its
the
best
smoked
beer
ive
ever
had
not
that
ive
had
many
and
ill
enjoy
looking
forward
to
its
appearance
every
fall
o
i
was
oversold
when
i
asked
for
a
good
rausch
and
was
recommended
this
the
smoke
here
isnt
much
beyond
what
i
would
expect
from
any
porter
besides
that
it
tastes
incredibly
artificial
a
misnomer
of
a
beer
for
sure
maybe
it
took
a
bad
ride
on
its
way
to
mi
overall
liquid
pork
ribs
in
a
bottle
but
somehow
it
works
quite
a
nice
unique
creative
beer
very
appropriate
for
a
st
louis
based
brewery
though
brewed
in
wi
i
certainly
get
the
smoke
but
it
isnt
overpowering
i
could
have
gone
for
a
bit
more
smoke
flavor
overall
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
subtleties
are
what
make
it
good
when
combined
with
the
smoke
without
being
overpowering
i
could
certainly
sit
down
and
have
a
couple
of
these
o
glad
i
picked
it
up
not
quite
as
smokey
as
new
hollands
dragons
milk
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
slightly
see
through
brown
colour
with
thin
tan
head
smells
of
lots
of
smoke
with
some
mild
roast
smoke
dominates
a
lot
of
the
flavour
but
there
is
some
chocolate
in
there
too
still
has
a
nice
sweetness
fairly
light
body
for
a
porter
but
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
i
really
like
it
smoke
might
fall
just
short
of
some
of
the
toptier
porters
but
not
by
much
everyone
should
try
this
brew
i
love
me
a
good
smoke
beer
it
just
reminds
me
of
sitting
around
the
campfire
eating
baked
beans
and
hot
dogs
just
roasted
on
a
stick
but
i
have
to
say
i
have
made
beer
with
malts
that
i
smoked
myself
and
my
favorite
wood
to
smoke
malts
with
was
definitely
apple
i
knew
it
was
a
shot
in
the
dark
that
this
beer
would
deliver
apple
smoke
but
the
peat
delivers
a
nice
flavor
do
every
sip
made
me
want
another
the
look
and
smell
left
something
to
be
desired
but
overall
a
solid
beer
from
ofallon
the
color
was
deep
amber
and
creamy
head
which
laced
ok
the
nose
was
common
of
most
porters
there
is
a
definite
smokedhickory
aroma
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
coffee
the
taste
had
roastyness
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
fairly
easy
on
the
mouth
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
then
tire
of
the
taste
o
this
was
a
nice
smoked
ale
nothing
top
notch
in
my
book
but
better
than
average
the
smoke
really
drives
this
beer
and
for
that
it
makes
it
a
little
one
trick
pony
the
abv
is
low
enough
you
could
drink
many
of
these
but
the
smoke
flavor
might
tend
to
be
a
little
much
for
most
people
d
for
as
heavy
as
it
may
look
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
at
that
ive
had
smoked
beers
before
and
they
did
nothing
for
me
in
fact
i
had
made
up
my
mind
before
drinking
it
that
i
probably
wouldnt
like
it
i
couldnt
of
been
more
wrong
i
cant
wait
to
fire
up
my
smoker
this
summer
and
enjoy
this
beer
next
time
i
smoke
a
rack
of
ribs
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
in
this
style
the
problem
is
it
is
not
really
a
style
i
enjoy
greatly
the
smokey
flavor
is
present
but
it
is
not
completely
overpowering
like
other
smoke
beers
i
have
had
if
smokey
beers
is
something
that
you
like
then
you
should
definitely
check
out
this
beer
nothing
like
enjoying
some
fine
tunes
and
brews
before
rocking
into

one

you
couldnt
get
that
pours
a
dark

blackbrown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
powder
light
coffee
and
a
very
mild
bit
of
hickory
smoke
the
taste
comes
across
very
similarly
with
the
smoke
a
bit
a
very
small
bit
more
robust
the
chocolate
less
powdery
and
a
touch
of
molasses
added
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
slightlylight
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dry
finish
overall
strictly
as
a
porter
this
was
pretty
good
i
will
say
though
as
a
smoked
porter
its
a
disappointment
the
smoke
is
far
too
subdued
especially
considering
the
plethora
of
complimentary
characteristics
surrounding
it
frankly
for
something
labeled
as
smoke

this

to
be

of
the
more
unique
beers
weve
had
the
pleasure
of
crossing
paths
with
in
a
while
the
contrast
between
the
intensely
soured
lacto
and
the
heavy
smokiness
especially
through
the
flavor
made
for
an
incredibly
interesting
and
innovative
display
high
acidity
meets
savory
malty
smokiness
and
it
works
you
get
a
mix
of
the
best
of
both
worlds
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
easy
to
see
why
it
might
not
appeal
to
some
avoid

if
you
hate

avoid
it
if
you
dont
like

otherwise
if
youre
adventurous
with
your
beverages
try
it
and
let
this
guy
get
to
room
temperature
for
the
full
effect
this
is
our
first
brush
with
a
grimm
ale
and
we
can
safely
say
that
it
has
piqued
our
interest
for
the
brewery
but
dont
let
any
of
that
turn
you
off
odd
though
it
may
seem
these
attributes
are
pros
not
cons
and
besides
lack
intensity
uniqueness
notwithstanding
this
is
delicious
quenching
and
delightfully
effervescent
actionadventure
is
indeed
something
to
get
excited
about
this
blockbuster
of
a
beer
is
without
doubt
one
of
the
most
simultaneously
interesting
and
fantastic
offerings
of
recent
memory
serving
type
bottle
more
and
more
grimm
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
new
york
breweries
they
just
simply
dont
disappoint
i
was
really
excited
by
the
anticipation
of
this
beer
but
was
ultimately
disappointed
my
research
lead
me
to
be
intrigued
by
its
old
world
charm
and
the
possibilities
of
a
smoked
sour
hopefully
some
other
version
of
this
elusive
style
will
prove
my
imagination
lives
up
to
the
intrigue
this
beer
is
in
the
vein
of
a
smoky
berliner
weisse
or
as
they
claim
a
lichtenhainer
which
must
be
a
similar
german
style
its
good
but
the
combination
of
sweet
apple
flavors
and
the
heaviness
throws
everything
out
of
balance
for
what
its
worth
i
like
the
way
the
smoke
is
integrated
not
a
bad
combo
at
all
and
this
beer
is
worth
trying
but
this
isnt
a
reinvention
of
the
wheel
a
well
made
sour
and
a
flavorful
beer
at
its
abv
overall
an
excellent
sour
and
reminds
me
of
the
kim
hibiscus
from
singlecut
o
i
dont
personally
like
drinking
a
campfire
but
it
is
a
smoked
rye
so
if
that
is
your
thing
then
this
one
has
it
if
you
like
a
strong
smokey
flavor
and
burnt
grains
this
is
a
good
beer
for
you
if
you
are
looking
for
a
more
traditional
dopplebock
this
isnt
a
good
choice
smoked
beers
are
very
hit
and
miss
mostly
due
to
the
finesse
needed
when
dealing
with
smoked
malt
this
beer
wasnt

at
all
i
would
have
liked
a

spot
and
balance
just
right
worthy
repeat
o
charkoota
rye
is
my
favorite
smoked
beer
ever
i
think
smoking
the
malted
barley
over
cherry
wood
really
distinguishes
the
smoke
character
and
compliments
the
doppelbock
style
very
well
frankly
im
shocked
that
this
beer
isnt
rated
higher
im
going
to
excuse
the
nose
in
the
overall
portion
of
my
review
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
and
i
especially
like
when
they
involve
malty
sweetness
this
beer
absolutely
delivers
in
both
departments
the
rye
is
a
great
complement
to
the
smoked
malt
also
i
will
be
looking
for
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
in
the
future
overall
wow
i
didnt
expect
such
a
dry
peat
flavored
experience
from
this
avoid
unless
you
really
love
rye
and
smoked
wood
d
wow
2010
vintage
double
wow
this
agescellars
super
well
looking
at
other
reviews
and
from
my
own
experience
with
smoke
beers
this
must
have
been
quite
a
bit
more
smokey
when
fresher
it
still
has
plenty
of
smoke
but
the
focus
is
now
more
on
the
very
rich
and
reasonably
complex
malts
full
of
great
flavors
that
transition
around
dark
malty
sweety
smokey
spicy
rye
and
a
great
rich
feel
this
is
a
great
treat
o
i
am
not
a
huge
smoked
beer
fan
but
this
seems
fairly
well
done
there
is
a
huge
smoked
malt
presence
which
is
great
for
a
sipper
but
detracts
from
the
drinkability
there
is
no
way
i
could
have
more
than
810oz
of
this
and
it
would
be
best
paired
with
an
indulgent
pungent
food
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
paired
perfectly
with
homemade
split
pea
soup
with
ham
carrots
and
sweet
onions
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
heartwarming
at
8
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
it
suffers
from
an
identity
crisis
and
fails
to
create
an
identity
of
its
own
at
the
same
time
not
impressed
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
caramel
and
maple
syrup
in
the
taste
maple
syrupy
and
a
small
smoke
presence
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
and
smokey
kind
of
aftertaste
syrupy
and
smokey
a
bit
sweet
but
it
is
ok
this
is
smoked
rye
dopplebock
burgundybrown
in
color
the
smoke
aroma
fills
the
glass
and
is
the
first
thing
i
noticedas
well
as
the
last
theres
some
notes
of
sweet
smoked
woods
applewood
cherrywood
that
approximate
in
my
mind
a
combination
of
the
fruit
and
grilling
it
has
a
sharp
focused
flavorthe
smokiness
dominates
definitely
with
enough
maltiness
to
give
it
body
and
heft
and
a
dopplebock
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
id
definitely
try
it
again
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
bbq
or
big
juicy
steak
the
smokiness
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer

d
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
a
couple
categories
could
have
been
a
bit
higher
so
thus
a
higher
score
here
great
balance
between
the
smoke
and
the
doppelbock
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
color
beer
with
a
nice
thick
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
smoked
malt
is
quite
intense
with
light
caramelized
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
dominated
by
a
great
malt
base
with
loads
of
smoke
notes
with
some
caramelized
notes
with
light
molasses
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
smoked
beer
outside
of
the
original
german
smoked
beer
o
i
thought
there
was
a
perfect
amount
of
smoke
to
this
beer
not
overly
smoky
at
all
the
carbonation
could
have
been
toned
down
a
smidge
but
overall
this
is
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
thanks
for
the
bottle
jay
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
quite
good
at
first
but
it
got
harder
to
drink
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
pour
there
was
a
slightly
weird
aftertaste
that
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
not
for
me
the
smoke
flavor
is
way
too
intensified
making
more
than
a
few
ounces
impossible
o
im
really
liking
this
beer
the
flavor
is
wonderful
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
if
you
like
smoked
beers
this
is
one
to
get
your
hands
on
o
a
pretty
awesome
rauchbier
err
dopplebock
or
whatever
category
this
beer
falls
under
it
is
pretty
tasty
drinkability
is
not
great
weird
and
bacony
i
like
my
beer
and
bacon
separate
finished
like
an
apa
or
even
ipa
smoke
was
present
but
not
overpowering
and
while
it
went
well
with
the
spicy
meaty
pizza
i
would
really
like
to
try
it
with
real
slowsmoked
bbq
this
is
a
new
batch
on
tap
and
im
really
aching
to
pop
open
the
2010
vintage
bottles
found
at
repetes
party
store
in
holland
mi
tasted
like
last
nights
campfire
too
pours
a
deep
brown
color
off
white
head
forms
and
leaves
wispy
lace
aroma
is
malty
peaty
and
somewhat
sweet
smelling
with
mild
campfire
suggestions
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
to
a
point
with
brown
sugar
caramel
munich
malts
molasses
and
a
touch
of
smoke
i
did
not
find
the
smoke
to
be
overbearing
it
melded
nicely
with
the
rye
notes
smooth
and
almost
creamy
a
well
made
lager
that
i
would
definately
have
again
would
be
a
great
candidate
to
marinate
pork
as
well
i
sampled
this
beer
on
tap
at
new
holland
on
08132011
the
color
was
a
rusty
copper
with
a
slight
head
the
smoke
in
the
aroma
was
very
apparent
but
not
overpowering
i
believe
the
key
to
a
good
smoked
beer
is
for
the
flavor
to
not
be
sensely
murdered
by
saltiness
as
is
the
case
in
three
floyds
ham
rye
the
other
problem
with
smoke
beers
is
not
enough
flavor
this
beer
is
well
balanced
it
has
a
nice
smoke
taste
without
being
overly
salty
it
goes
down
very
smooth
unlikely
a
number
of
smoke
beers
you
can
drink
more
than
a
sample
without
becoming
bored
the
aftertaste
stays
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
but
is
able
to
go
with
a
meal
and
not
kill
the
flavor
of
the
meal
it
is
certainly
among
the
more
balanced
smoke
beers
its
put
forth
as
a
smoked
beer
and
it
brings
it
thus
im
rating
it
very
high
maybe
this
is
served
a
bit
to
cold
but
no
notes
on
the
bottle
as
far
as
rec
temp
just
removed
from
fridge
and
let
set
for
about
10
min
before
opening
there
is
nothing
that
really
steps
forward
for
me
even
after
reading
the
label
again
i
cant
figure
this
out
very
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
like
again
quite
a
hefty
body
and
sweetness
to
balance
a
deft
hand
on
the
smoke
somewhere
between
campfire
char
and
hickory
smoked
bacon
caramel
and
bready
malts
which
border
on
syrupy
but
hold
the
smoke
in
check
earthy
and
slightly
spicy
rye
molasses
dark
fruits
light
drying
finish
im
not
often
a
huge
fan
of
smoke
beers
but
this
one
is
done
well
they
rye
gives
a
nice
complexity
and
the
body
is
hefty
enough
to
balance
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
prefer
the
aecht
schlenkerla
urbock
which
is
more
balanced
compared
to
this
i
dont
pick
up
on
any
rye
at
all
knock
off
that
medicinal
bent
on
this
and
the
drink
will
sing
but
otherwise
it
has
a
glaring
fault
o
the
beer
goes
down
rather
smoothly
and
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
smokiness
is
not
overpowering
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
mahogany
tint
to
it
twofinger
tan
head
forms
but
then
dies
down
pretty
quickly
good
partial
cap
with
quite
a
few
bubbles
the
nose
brings
a
slight
amount
of
roasted
malt
along
with
a
good
dosing
of
smoke
not
as
much
smoked
meat
more
toward
the
bonfire
end
of
the
spectrum
some
charred
wood
there
flavor
has
a
good
smoke
presence
along
with
a
bit
of
bacon
moderate
roast
as
well
medium
body
with
a
dry
smokey
character
moderate
carbonation
interesting
brew
glad
to
try
this
drinkability
although
interesting
i
dont
see
searching
this
out
again
o
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
smoke
and
not
really
very
balanced
a
pretty
solid
brew
that
has
the
distinct
smokey
character
of
how
smoke
would
really
act
it
just
finds
its
way
around
the
edges
and
builds
lightly
to
fill
the
center
of
the
palate
fans
of
smoked
beers
will
most
likely
enjoy
this
balanced
doppelbock
take
of
the
style
by
new
holland
i
know
i
did
this
is
a
goto
for
me
and
one
of
my
favorites
this
particular
bottle
doesnt
live
up
to
my
memory
but
i
set
the
bar
pretty
high
for
it
it
is
indeed
superrich
so
id
recommend
sharing
this
one
unless
youre
super
into
smoke
and
malt
overall
good
but
very
rich
i
wouldnt
have
possibly
been
able
to
put
away
a
whole
bottle
by
myself
the
interplay
of
the
woodsmoke
and
malt
sweetness
was
good
i
personally
enjoyed
the
level
of
the
smoke
but
i
can
see
others
finding
it
too
strong
a
mighty
fine
smoked
beer
pours
dark
with
a
moderate
white
head
to
complement
it
significant
smoked
aromas
the
whole
9
yards
of
smoke
above
average
mouthfeel
comes
a
great
with
a
rolling
maltiness
a
little
rye
a
complex
array
of
smoked
malt
that
keeps
the
interest
vert
drinkable
decent
enough
to
drink
my
only
qualm
is
that
i
am
by
myself
drinking
22
oz
of
very
smoky
beer
i
wish
i
had
saved
this
to
share
with
a
friend
because
it
is
probity
going
to
be
too
much
as
i
get
further
into
the
beer
i
find
this
beer
to
be
right
up
my
alley
the
sweetness
and
smoke
play
wonderfully
off
of
each
other
without
being
overpowering
for
me
id
love
to
have
more
from
notes
121410
medium
bodied
with
a
good
bit
of
smoke
character
that
lingers
throughout
into
a
sweet
yet
dry
finish
hints
of
charcoal
bacon
bbq
and
campfire
but
theres
a
nice
balance
of
sweeter
malt
notes
especially
caramel
toffee
and
vinous
dark
fruit
theres
some
cherry
flavor
from
the
wood
aging
as
well
as
some
grape
fig
and
plum
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
not
as
smokey
as
i
usually
prefer
but
this
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
knocked
the
drinkability
down
based
on
my
personal
preference
i
like
the
beer
fine
i
just
wasnt
in
a
hurry
to
have
a
second
any
time
soon
md
this
is
really
really
really
hard
to
drink
mild

low

i
find
the
faster
you
drink
the
easier
it
is
to
hide
the
awful
burnt
acrid
smoky
rancid
pork
flavors
id
never
ever
ever
suggest
this
out
to
anyone
ever
ive
had
worse
beers
and
as
it
warmed
it
went
from
absolutely
undrinkable
to
just
undrinkable
least
it
looked
average
skip
skip
skip
let
me
preface
this
review
by
saying
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
dopplebock
than
rye
beer
so
maybe
my
expectations
were
a
little
off
poured
a
reddishbrown
body
w
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
died
quick
on
top
of
a
malt
aroma
stating
the
obvious
i
am
w
that
malt
aroma
smokey
little
meaty
oaky
woodiness
with
some
roastedtoasted
maltsbarley
as
well
as
touch
of
caramel
and
black
cherry
a
very
meatytasting
beer
and
i
like
it
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
fruit
and
malt
complexity
in
the
taste
the
beer
has
a
stickiness
from
some
molasses
and
goes
down
a
tad
haggard
in
a
medium
body
but
the
toasted
malts
and
rye
balance
for
a
dry
edge
that
isnt
overpwering
little
sweet
but
more
dry
but
does
mellow
as
it
warms
cant
really
say
theres
much
to
sweet
and
fruitness
other
than
caramel
and
cherry
all
in
all
a
very
respectable
effort
the
degree
of
smokiness
tended
to
push
all
other
flavors
out
of
the
way
detracting
a
bit
from
what
could
have
been
a
more
nuanced
complexity
the
label
boasts
of
rye
and
four
other
malts
so
assuming
that
thered
be
a
good
portion
of
pilsner
or
munich
malt
as
the
base
smoked
peat
with
oily
slickness
this
brew
makes
a
great

love
this
beer
one
of
the
strangest
the
flavor
is
much
of
the
samea
deep
and
woodsy
smoke
taste
very
malty
but
the
smoke
tends
to
dominate
even
that
lingering
meat
so
when
i
saw
a
smoked
rye
doppelbock
dried
fruits
and
mild
cocoa
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
some
warming
alcohol
and
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
peaty
with
a
pronounced
sterile
gauzeband

not

this
carries
over
into

at

only
the
second
smoked
dbock
i
have
had
i
had
this
smoked
beer
at
pipers
pub
a
couple
weeks
ago
while
visiting
the
southside
nearly
opaque
dark
as
night
with
hints
of
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
dark
tan
head
forms
thick
aroma
has
a
nice
robust
layer
of
smoke
mild
smoked
meats
with
some
campfire
roasted
malts
other
tones
that
arose
were
a
mellow
fruitiness
with
soft
grain
character
of
the
oatmeal
flavor
actually
lead
with
the
tartness
of
the
some
vinous
dark
fruit
character
with
a
smoked
malt
character
finishing
it
off
with
a
pretty
heavy
hand
smoked
meat
was
mellow
nowhere
near
as
in
your
face
as
some
of
the
bambergian
brethren
herbal
hops
with
a
nice
dark
roasted
malt
character
finishes
it
out
to
complement
the
smoked
malts
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
fuller
texture
with
the
oatmeal
addition
thick
enough
for
the
winter
but
not
overbearing
enough
to
deter
me
in
the
early
sunny
days
of
spring
even
carbonation
made
for
effortless
drinkability
i
didnt
detect
any
heat
from
this
beer
but
was
expecting
something
closer
to
a
smoked
baltic
porter
in
alcohol
overall
nothing
compares
to
the
quality
beers
from
victory
ive
been
trying
on
a
consistent
basis
they
understand
what
great
beer
is
all
about
three
styles
on
side
by
side
this
was
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
and
it
was
still
excellent
overall
while
it
lacks
some
things
in
body
and
mouthfeel
it
is
a
nice
more
bitter
porter
with
good
aroma
and
taste
worth
a
try
overall
not
a
bad
smoke
beer
nothing
earth
shattering
but
not
bad
overall
takes
some
getting
used
to
and
i
admittedly
am
not
a
huge
smoked
beer
fan
i
rather
liked
this
as
it
basically
came
off
like
a
smoked
oatmeal
stout
but
it
was
still
well
balanced
with
the
smoke
never
overpowering
any
of
the
other
flavors
this
was
maybe
a
little
too
lively
feeling
at
times
but
the
overall
presentation
here
won
me
other
this
is
the
type
of
unique
offering
that
i
expect
to
find
here
at
the
brewpub
o
no
real
hop

cheers
beertracker
the
smokiness
was
nice
with
some
mild
complexities
of
meat
and
peppers
but
not
quite
complex
enough
to
carry
the
beer
all
on
their
own
o
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
because
theres
a
good
amount
of
smoky
flavors
but
theyre
not
overpowering
medium
bodied
with
a
smokier
profile
than
the
aroma
suggests
with
hints
of
charcoal
bacon
and
bbq
but
the
smokiness
doesnt
dominate
letting
the
other
flavors
shine
through
hints
of
caramel
rye
toffee
and
hazelnut
with
nice
bitter
hops
up
front
and
subtle
spice
decent
balance
but
not
as
smokey
as
i
prefer
its
still
pretty
good
however
wit
some
rauchy
flavor
as
well
as
some
sweet
malt
toast
and
faint
dark

victory
branded

a

gentle
chocolate
oatmeal

in
the
finish
is
where
this
beer
really
got
me
a
pleasant
smoked
flavor
and
hint
of

cured

nice
and
rich
smooth
and
velvety
going
down
a
nice
session
ale
smoked
beers
originated
in
germany
and
for
a
quick
second
i
thought
i
was
there
after
checking
out
this
brew
and
also
seeing
other
reviews
i
can
help
to
to
add
like
i
did
above
this
brew
is
nearly
a
meal
in
itself
though
thin
at
times
it
takes
the
smoke
and
the
flavors
of
an
oatmeal
stout
and
gives
a
nice
hearty
brew
that
is
very
enjoyable
i
would
certianly
have
this
brew
again
another
great
brew
by
victory
da
really
good
marriage
of
two
of
my
favourite
styles
of
beer
oatmeal
stout
and
rauchbier
the
smoke
is
really
nicely
incorporated
and
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
well
rounded
and
not
too
charged
with
alcohol
this
makes
for
a
highly
drinkable
beer
if
this
gets
bottles
it
would
definitely
go
in
my
rotation
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
take
on
a
smoked
beer
from
victory
and
wouldnt
be
upset
if
they
decided
to
bottle
this
d
quite
drinkable
almost
a
meal
in
the
glass
the
pairing
of
smoke
and
oatmeal
stout
is
one
that
i
wouldnt
expect
to
work
so
nicely
drinkability
scores
really
high
with
me
on
this
one
its
not
the
most
flavorful
complex
or
rich
example
of
the
style
but
it
sure
is
well
done
and
quite
easy
to
put
back
a
few
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
an
exceptionally
smooth
feel
it
has
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
the
abv
is
suppressed
very
drinkable
if
i
had
more
time
i
would
sit
and
enjoy
a
few
of
these
for
a
smoked
beer
it
is
on
the
lighter
side
possibly
a
good
intro
beer
for
someone
who
isnt
ready
to
take
the
plunge
into
an
all
out
rauchbier
assault
of
smokiness
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
thick
brown
head
smell
is
very
smokey
and
full
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
less
smokey
than
the
smell
but
it
still
delivers
a
very
pleasant
smoke
taste
that
isnt
offputing
nice
thick
mouthfeel
that
lingers
allinall
a
really
nice
offering
from
victory
overall
and
interesting
and
enjoyable
smoked
beer
d
a
solid
smoked
beer
it
wasnt
that
smokey
but
good
nonetheless
really
just
an
easy
drinking
porter
with
some
smoke
in
the
finish
drinkability
was
good
too
i
enjoyed
this
something
thats
not
unheard
of
for
a
smoked
beer
but
is
certainly
not
common
i
give
victory
props
for
a
great
special
occasion
beer
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
perhaps
not
something
i
am
drinking
frequently
but
certainly
worth
a
try
no
other
brews
i
have
tried
come
to
mind
as
being
similar
to
this
tons
of

just

overall
a

just
wish
the
smoke
was
a

more

offering
a
very
pleasing
entry
from

longshot
series
this
resembles
a
gose
but
is
slightly
smokier
the
smoke
produces
an
illusion
of
salt
at
the
end
or
maybe
its
the
hops
but
whichever
its
darn
good
if
sa
produced
this
regularly
id
buy
it
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
body
with
white
soda
pop
head
that
quickly
dissipates
ive
never
had
a
gratzer
before
and
i
find
it
very
intriguing
aromas
call
to
mind
how
i
imagine
ancient
offerings
of
burnt
grains
smelled
to
the
nostrils
of
the
gods
very
smokey
with
a
big
whiff
of
wheatiness
i
also
get
small
hints
of
celery
and
carrot
greens
the
flavor
is
straight
up
smoked
wheat
through
and
through
with
a
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
apricot
jam
spread
over
wheat
toast
the
body
is
a
little
thin
as
the
sodalike
head
suggested
overall
this
is
a
novelty
beer
of
such
unique
character
that
everyone
should
try
it
at
least
once
even
though
they
probably
wont
want
to
have
several
backtoback
i
really
have
nothing
to
compare
this
to
and
so
my
scores
are
less
useful
than
my
actual
comments
pours
a
hazy
lemonyellow
with
a
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
some
goodsized
bubbles
too
though
not
rapidly
heading
northward
a
fair
scent
of
toasty
wood
and
smoke
some
citrus
a
hint
of
basil
this
one
is
a
sweetertasting
beer
at
the
start
and
then
it
sours
and
leaves
a
more
bitter
finish
its
slightly
viscous
but
clean
the
wheat
is
a
noticeable
flavor
as
is
ginger
unfortunately
the
smokiness
is
buried
after
a
few
sips
and
so
it
begins
to
taste
more
like
a
slightly
fizzy
thintasting
farmhouse
pale
ale
o
a
nice
smoked
wheat
beer
with
a
definite
focus
on
smoke
while
not
getting
cloying
or
overly
smokey
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
go
great
with
bbq
or
smoked
meats
overall
just
imagine
a
summer
light
ale
with
mucho
flavor
this
is
what
we
have
here
i
hope
sam
adams
takes
some
notes
from
this

and
releases
something
along
these
lines

tamer
less

with
more
pedestrian
sweet

than
the
professor
fritz
briem
grodziskie
reconstruction
it
was
still
an
interesting
and
nice
drinking
light
beer
the
smoke
element
was
distinctive
but
light
i
enjoyed
this
one
could
have
been
quite
remarkable
with
a
little
more
intensity
overall
ok
lighter
smoke
which
was
needed
to
not
send
this
overboard
nice
creamy
like
wheat
and
toasty
grain
malt
with
a
decent
smoked
cheese
note
fairly
flavorful
without
going
overboard
however
just
didnt
have
a
whole
lot
going
on
as
if
they
lost
something
extra
when
they
scaled
it
up
brew
taste
is
lightly
crackery
mild

lightly
tart
mild
smoke
its
ok
a
little
bland
light
bodied
the
carbonation
ebbs
away
fairly
quickly
overall
it
was
worth
a
try
but
a
little
too
bland
overall
restrained
but
quaint
a
nice
light
smoked
ale
a
reliable
grätzer
good
summertime
enjoyment
drinking
overall
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
overall
an
impressive
smoked
wheat
beer
and
deserving
of
its
longshot
achievement
this
is
a
great
summer
drink
but
i
could
always
go
for
one
of
these
really
good
stuff
this
was
underwhelming
the
second
underwhelmer
out
of
this
years
longshot
batch
the
smokey
character
is
certainly
decent
and
improves
with
warmth
other
than
that
both
smell
and
taste
is
lemon
and
hint
of
biscuit
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
interesting
brew
perfect
for
a
hot
day
but
the
smoke
adds
some
complexity
would
be
nice
with
bbq
eric
tastesurprising
but
welcome
dose
of
smoked
malt
followed
closely
by
herbal
hop
notes
looks
can
be
deceiving
as
this
lightbodied
brew
delivers
a
lot
of
subtle
character
and
tasty
flavor
sessionable
with
very
interesting
taste
a
perfect
match
for
grilled
brats
or
cajun
blackened
fish
pours
a
hazy
light
straw
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
persists
forever
because
its
fed
by
a
constant
stream
of
carb
bubbles
aromas
of
spice
bready
wheat
and
light
yeast
and
smokey
phenols
the
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
sugary
malt
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
bit
of
smokey
charcoal
to
counter
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
decent
enough
beer
but
not
something
that
excited
me
or
anything
i
would
reach
for
again
the
body
is
light
but
verges
almost
into
medium
territory
but
doesnt
quite
it
shouldnt
though
and
the
light
body
is
one
of
the
delightful
oddities
it
has
a
solid
crispness
though
its
not
quite
stolid
to
the
end
it
eases
into
the
carbonation
and
levels
out
smoothness
is
moderate
not
quite
able
to
take
full
effect
but
pretty
good
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
smoked
malt
campfire
and
earth
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
smoke
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
smoke
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
smoke
is
pretty
subtle
all
around
o
i
always
get
a
longshot
six
pack
every
year
even
if
theyre
not
the
best
beers
theyre
always
fun
to
try
while
this
one
isnt
particularly
good
its
also
unique
in
that
ive
never
had
a
gratzer
before
ergo
i
cant
hate
this
one
still
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
with
more
hoppiness
more
lemon
tartness
and
a
drier
more
subtle
smoke
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
example
of
gratzer
this
is
the
first
one
ive
had
one
and
while
i
thought
it
was
solid
i
dont
think
im
too
into
the
style
since
i
dont
think
the
smoke
and
the
belgian
wit
bier
base
worked
that
great
together
and
i
think
just
as
a
smoked
beer
i
would
say
its
right
around
average
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
clean
crisp
and
not
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
one
would
be
enough
for
me
since
i
dont
really
have
the
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
but
i
think
this
would
be
nice
to
have
in
the
spring
or
early
fall
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
when
it
came
to
the
the
taste
neither
the
malt
base
or
the
smokey
aspect
were
too
overpowering
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
the
smokey
aspect
worked
with
the
belgian
wit
bier
base
it
just
didnt
meld
together
that
great
and
i
felt
like
the
orange
rind
and
coriander
aspect
clashed
with
the
smoke
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
all
in
all
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
it
left
me
wishing
that
the
flavors
worked
together
better
and
i
thought
that
made
it
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
this
is
isnt
my
favorite
smoked
beer
or
my
favorite
longshot
beer
i
just
dont
think
its
too
memorable
as
a
whole
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
years
longshot
series
and
i
thought
the
american
stout
was
the
best
beer
in
the
six
pack
with
the
pineapple
ipa
was
my
least
favorite
by
a
good
amount
the
2012
longshot
six
pack
is
still
far
and
away
my
favorite
year
for
this
series
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
this
one
just
wasnt
for
me
better
luck
next
time
o
a
nice
smokey
character
with
good
drinkability
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
but
this
was
nice
good
job
cesar
moderately

a
trace
of
brussels
lacing
is
present
aroma
of
pale
wheat
with
a
slightly
sweet
faint
overly
ripe
banana
note
the
flavor
provides
a
nice
burst
of
smokiness
that
dominates
the
front
of
the
pale
you
get
a
rush
of
pale
wheat
and
then
on
the
fade
a
deep
campfire
like
smokey
fade
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
of
the
smokiness
in
the
aroma
to
join
it
as
it
catches
you
off
guard
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
wishing
that
the
taste
were
more
acute
i
look
for
a
dive
into
fullon
berlinerweiss
for
improvement
this
could
also
tame
the
smoky
current
that
seems
to
wonder
the
palate
aimlessly
o
on
paper
this
is
perhaps
the
most
ridiculous
combination
of
flavors
ive
ever
heard
in
execution
it
works
about
as
well
as
it
could
though
the
balance
is
on
point
and
its
subtle
where
it
needs
to
be
which
is
pretty
much
everywhere
its
actually
a
pretty
decent
brew
all
things
considered
an
interesting
slice
of
history
to
be
sure
but
i
dont
expect
this
to
ever
take
off
as
a
style
overall
my
first
of
the
style
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
a
sessionable
option
that
has
a
tone
going
on
would
be
a
good
choice
to
win
someone
over
if
they
are
not
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
beer

very

overall
very
subtle
flavors
had
a
hard
time
discerning
the
different
flavors
picking
up
the
smoke
etc
still
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
pours
slightly
hazy
orangish
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
there
are
plenty
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
the
beer
the
beer
smells
of
light
smoke
with
some
wheat
and
light
tartness
the
mild
smokiness
and
tartness
carries
over
into
the
flavor
the
sour
flavor
is
very
mild
so
it
would
not
be
off
putting
for
a
beginner
the
smoke
follows
the
same
pattern
here
adding
flavor
rather
than
being
overpowering
theres
a
good
malt
backbone
here
as
well
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
some
of
the
smokiness
and
aftertaste
carry
into
the
finish
the
beer
drinks
pretty
easily
which
i
would
expect
at
4
abv
this
is
a
tasty
beer
o
good
smoked
beer
that
had
a
lot
of
complexity
though
i
would
have
liked
some
more
smoked
aromas
worth
trying
for
its
uniqueness
and
it
is
good
in
its
own
right
an
interesting
smokey
session
like
beer
not
bad
i
could
have
this
again
kind
of
fun
really
would
like
to
have
this

with
a

that
subsided
to
a

slowly
maintained
nice

throughout
the

the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
subtle
smoke
sour
wheat
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
smoke
and
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
i
really
dont
know
what
this
brew
was
trying
to
be
if
i
am
completely
honest
here
it
looked
like
a
berliner
and
the
smoke
gave
me
the
idea
that
maybe
it
was
a
smoked
berliner
however
something
on
the
flavor
was
just
offputting
here
while
there
wasnt
very
much
going
on
with
it
all
of
it
just
seemed
to
clash
on
your
tongue
with
no
regard
for
safety
the
wheat
on
this
one
was
definitely
overpowering
the
entire
thing
including
the
smoke
which
i
found
hard
to
believe
not
sure
if
i
would
have
this
one
again
given
other
options
but
worth
trying
at
least
once
i
suppose
the
pour
is
a
pale
golden
color
with
only
a
slight
haze
starts
off
with
lots
of
wheat
aroma
and
sweet
maltbread
after
that
the
smoke
really
comes
through
and
there
is
a
subtle
lemony
tartness
the
flavor
is
just
off
its
quite
smokey
but
also
very
watery
might
have
a
little
bit
of
saltiness
to
it
as
well
just
a
strange
beer
my
overall
impression
though
is
that
i
like
it
the
low
abv
and
unique
flavor
profile
is
appealing
and
i
can
see
this
being
great
with
food
i
would
put
it
up
against
any
potato
dumplings
or
bread
dumplings
saurkraut
definitely
and
maybe
some
baurenwurst
smoked
farmers
sausage
pretty
much
any
german
dish
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
that
is
spritzy
with
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
very
easy
drinking
very
reminiscent
of
a
berliner
weisse
but
with
a
slight
twist
i
have
only
had
a
handful
of
gratzer
offerings
and
man
has
this
one
opened
my
eyes
to
wanting
to
try
more
pours
a
deep
thick
yellow
with
white
topping
foam
head
mild
cheese
and
yeast
aroma
smooth
mouthfeel
takes
getting
used
to
mostly
getting
yeast
not
that
smokey
pleasant
and
complex
with
some
bitterness
and
mild
sourness
something
i
can
sip
over
the
course
of
a
night
good
with
cheese
light
and
pretty
thin
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
though
some
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
german
macro
but
it
is
an
interesting
little
brew
id
say
that
this
was
an
interesting
reasonably
priced
beer
but
its
lacking
in
the
drytartness
that
i
prefer
in
a
sour
id
like
to
see
more
beers
like
this
because
its
really
got
some
potential

thanks
blueokie
for
the
opportunity
o
good
for
the
style
would
recommend
and
i
find
this
superior
to
alaskan
smoked
porter
o
very
nice
smoked
beer
the
smoke
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
just
the
right
amount
paired
this
with
a
bbq
burger
pulled
pork
piled
on
top
of
a
burger
and
it
was
great
o
this
is
perhaps
the
smokiest
beer
that
i
have
experienced
the
smoke
doesnt
ever
get
out
of
hand
and
provides
and
interesting
porter
with
plenty
of
depth
holy
god
this
is
mostly
smoke
with
a
little
bit
of
porter
it
pours
the
dark
brown
youd
expect
from
the
style
but
everthewhile
it
smells
like
wood
ashes
are
wafting
around
the
room
there
are
times
when
some
smoke
is
appreciated
and
there
is
times
when
it
makes
me
think
they
burnt
the
beer
this
is
the
latter
this
beer
takes
a
page
right
from
aecht
with
the
level
of
smoke
dear
god
it
smells
like
super
charred
bacon
surprisingly
the
taste
mellows
it
quite
nicely
but
by
this
point
im
making
sure
not
to
stick
my
nose
back
in
the
glass
the
taste
has
the
obvious
smoke
infuse
malt
flavor
with
some
chocolate
tones
behind
it
there
is
actually
a
nice
creamy
overall
feel
to
this
beer
and
overall
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
that
having
been
said
im
glad
somebody
else
bought
it
someone
like
tmoney2591
who
appreciates
the
smoke
way
more
than
i
do
o
a
good
beer
smoky
as
hell
but
still
drinkable
if
you
like
smoke
youll
like
this
one
if
not
id
stay
away
gots
to
love
the
smoke
amiright
lets
do
this
it
pours
a
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
darkish
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
maplesmoked
ham
milk
chocolate
and
light
roasted
malts
damn
do
i
enjoy
that
delicious
aroma
the
taste
holds
notes
of
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
powder
light
beech
smoke
and
very
light
maple
syrup
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
a
damn
fine
smoked
porter
good
work
krebs
d
drinkable
but
not
great
oway
too
smokey
this
just
must
not
be
my
thng
overall
a
real
treat
this
beer
definitely
lived
up
to
my
expectationshopes
and
was
in
fact
the
first
beer
of
the
6
scot
sent
me
that
i
put
into
my
fridge
for
consumption
the
bar
has
been
set
for
the
other
5
22oz
bottle
sent
as
part
of
a
poker
bif
payout
about
1
month
ago
this
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
tightly
celled
tan
foam
awesome
smoked
malt
aroma
rich
woody
sweet
caramel
malts
some
bitter
cocoa
provide
some
accents
for
what
is
mainly
a
smoky
flavor
delicious
easily
comparable
with
stone
smoked
porter
natural
comparison
light
carbonation
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
complement
to
the
flavors
liked
this
quite
a
bit
drinkability
is
great
its
got
a
huge
smoke
character
without
being
overdone
this
was
a
great
smoked
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
definitely
smokey
with
a
lot
of
meaty
bbq
notes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
there
is
a
heavy
smoke
character
that
goes
very
well
with
some
heavily
roasted
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
smoked
beer
where
the
smoke
is
up
front
and
shines
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
black
with
a
light
beige
colored
lacing
right
off
the
bat
it
smells
of
smoked
ham
and
smoked
wood
chips
its
possibly
the
second
smokiest
beer
ive
smelled
behind
the
alaskan
smoked
porter
it
smells
great
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
as
well
it
still
gives
you
the
typical
coffee
and
roast
of
a
regular
porter
with
the
nice
smoke
of
hickory
smoked
bacon
the
flavors
are
very
well
integrated
it
drinks
a
little
light
for
a
porter
but
with
the
flavor
profile
its
ok
this
beer
is
pretty
superb
im
very
impressed
its
an
excellent
smoked
beer
the
mouth
is
stellar
for
the
style
moderatelyfull
not
too
heavy
but
far
from
thin
i
like
it
now
this
beer
backs
up
what
it
claims
this
is
smoky
i
dig
it
ive
had
some
of
the
style
where
the
smoke
is
a
phantom
but
here
the
smoke
comes
out
full
force
still
mild
cocoa
notes
and
hints
of
sweetness
make
there
way
through
as
well
but
the
smoke
is
for
sure
the
main
player
this
isnt
a
style
for
everyone
but
i
enjoy
this
flavor
at
times
and
this
beer
delivers
thanks
again
chris
this
beer
pours
a
thick
black
color
with
a
slight
amount
of
tan
head
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
of
smoke
with
a
slight
amount
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
almost
all
smoke
so
much
so
that
it
overwhelms
the
rest
of
the
flavors
which
i
would
assume
consisted
of
some
roasted
malt
and
caramel
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
lacking
and
feels
empty
it
leaves
you
feeling
like
you
just
drank
smokey
water
overall
it
is
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
too
much
d
a
pretty
nice
porter
or
stout
with
some
light
smoke
to
it
would
have
again
nice
beer
would
definitely
not
turn
down
another
pour
yields
a
very
dark
brew
with
a
good
offwhite
head
and
some
lacing
as
it
moves
down
the
glass
the
nose
contains
a
good
amount
of
smoke
plus
some
roasted
malt
mild
coffee
and
a
wee
bit
of
very
dark
chocolate
good
start
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
integrated
and
doesnt
do
as
much
for
me
but
pretty
good
and
id
certainly
come
back
to
it
nothing
overpowering
just
a
nice
balanced
beer
with
some
smoke
complexity
added
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
dryness
in
the
finish
drinks
quite
well
one
of
the
best
krebs
beers
ive
had
to
date
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
decent
tasting
nice
thickness
throughout
with
a
clean
finish
there
is
a
mild
pleasant
smoke
finish
on
the
back
end
of
the
palate
that
grows
toward
the
midpalate
the
malt
is
on
the
front
overall
it
is
a
nice
decent
beer
d
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
one
i
would
have
again
though
not
in
the
same
category
as
alaskan
smoked
porter
well
done
db
high
for
a
smoked
porter
but
a
bomber
is
probably
enough
for
me
wow
it
took
me
back
to
camping
out
in
the
woods
lots
of
complex
layers
here
the
smoke
was
in
full
force
but
not
overpowering
everything
seemed
to
fit
in
its
flavor
puzzle
perfect
for
the
2011
snowpocalypse
my
second
beer
from
this
brewery
which
showed
to
be
an
improvement
over
the
1919
this
might
not
be
saying
much
since
the
recipe
is
from
a
contest
winter
the
color
and
smell
were
the
best
things
about
this
porter
it
was
almost
comforting
the
smoked
influence
was
distinct
in
the
smell
when
it
came
to
taste
it
reminded
me
of
the
liquid
smoke
my
dad
would
use
on
the
grill
it
wasnt
too
overpowering
but
seemed
to
disrupt
the
balance
of
the
beer
rather
than
add
a
unique
characteristic
since
this
appears
to
be
a
retired
brew
it
might
be
difficult
to
find
especially
outside
of
ok
if
you
like
this
style
its
definitely
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
it
to
measure
up
to
other
smoked
portersstone
this
one
straddles
the
fence
a
great
beer
here
perhaps
the
best
smoked
beer
i
have
had
the
flavor
continues
with
the
smokeladen
theme
overtaking
the
palate
like
a
bushfire
through
a
dry
forest
charred
chocolate
nuttiness
and
more
smoke
not
beefy
like
some
smoked
beers
which
i
admire
mouthfeel
is
spoton
for
the
style
with
both
a
crisp
and
smooth
body
carbonation
is
ample
but
restrained
enough
to
not
dry
out
the
finish
overall
a
very
tasty
very
sessionable
smoked
beer
hard
to
give
choc
100
of
the
credit
for
this
one
though
but
they
definitely
chose
right
a
flavorful
and
interesting
smoked
beer
much
more
going
on
than
just
smokiness
very
nice
very
drinkable
great
smoked
beer
i
like
that
its
a
smoked
porter
that
wasnt
afraid
to
use
the
smoke
most
of
them
make
the
smoke
a
little
to
subtle
for
my
liking
not
this
one
its
front
and
center
then
lets
the
other
flavors
build
around
it
nicely
the
feel
is
probably
the
best
attribute
for
me
somewhat
chewy
and
velvety
lower
carbonation
allows
for
this
smooth
feel
and
i
would
think
its
preferable
for
most
smoked
brews
again
this
benefits
from
room
temperature
and
promotes
good
drinkaility
complete
darkness
opaque
and
sporting
a
thick
collar
of
tan
lace
clean
smoke
and
charcoal
burnt
sugar
and
a
ripe
blackberry
fruitiness
in
the
nose
creamy
and
smooth
full
body
smokiness
is
very
aggressive
but
not
cloying
at
all
hops
drop
a
balancing
bitterness
and
faint
pine
resin
flavor
burnt
smoky
maltiness
has
suggestions
of
toasted
marshmallows
charred
wood
blackstrap
molasses
and
a
hint
of
brown
bread
in
the
back
slowwarming
alcohol
brings
a
faint
fruitiness
smokiness
takes
a
while
to
fade
in
the
burnt
bittersweet
finish
seriously
great
beer
here
d
imho
smoked
beers
should
replace
all
winter
warmers
absolutely
great
in
cold
weather
glad
to
spend
time
with
this
tonight
another
fine
effort
from
choc
brewing
and
another
reason
for
me
tipping
my
hat
to
russ
i
wonder
if
this
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
cellaring
d
i
havent
had
many
smoked
beers
but
this
one
is
definitely
at
the
top
of
the
list
the
taste
doesnt
quite
match
the
deliciousness
of
the
smell
but
it
still
tastes
great
perfect
on
a
cold
cold
night
watching
a
movie
and
a
fire
blazing
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
ommegang
tulip
pours
a
rich
chocolate
black
that
lets
absolutely
no
light
through
good
head
lacing
slowly
cascades
down
the
glass
as
it
settles
but
doesnt
stick
around
long
aromas
are
of
roasted
coffee
smoky
sweetness
from
the
cherry
wood
touches
of
cocoa
i
could
sit
here
and
literally
just
smell
this
beer
there
are
alot
of
really
good
subtle
notes
on
the
palate
the
smoke
is
predominant
but
there
is
a
really
nice
base
of
maltiiness
to
help
give
this
beer
balance
also
some
detectable
chocolate
notes
with
a
sweet
smooth
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
pleasant
for
the
style
drinkability
is
great
imo
alcohol

overall
just
above
average
cant
comment
about
how
faithful
of
a
representation
it
is
but
i
gather
from
reviews
and
ratings
that
it
is
lacking
although
if
you
are
interested
in
less
popular
styles
you
might
want
to
try
it
the
bottom
line
is
that
we
simply
ned
more
gratzer
beers
on
the
market
this
smoked
wheat
style
from
austria
is
unfortunately
dying
if
not
dead
and
a
revival
is
necessary
hazy
in
color
pale
rusty
orange
tint
short
almost
clear
head
it
smells
camp
rife
smokey
with
some
real
nice
earthiness
not
peaty
but
hardwood
smoke
its
very
strong
but
very
pleasant
the
wheat
malt
is
a
nice
light
base
for
it
to
flavor
the
beer
which
still
somehow
has
quite
a
bit
of
body
so
as
refreshing
and
light
as
it
is
its
still
hearty
and
dense
in
a
way
full
of
flavor
smoke
and
just
caramelizing
white
sugar
but
this
beer
isnt
sweet
its
got
a
hop
varietal
i
know
nothing
about
in
it
and
it
adds
bitterness
and
weight
without
a
lick
of
citrus
or
pine
flavor
perfectly
appropriate
in
this
context
well
carbonated
and
seasonally
and
culinarily
versatile
its
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
but
im
not
picky
right
now
when
it
comes
to
grazter
i
am
just
thankful

and
woody
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
smoke
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
there
is
also
something
in
the
beer
that
delivers
a
bit
of
a
numbing
quality
in
the
mouth
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
some
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
and
while
i
respect
the
historical
aspect
of
this
beer
i
could
not
drink
more
than
a
few

this

mouthfeel

somewhat
acrid
with
a
hint
of
acidity
that
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
overall
im
not
really
sure
how
to
rate
this
style
i
cant
say
i
care
for
it
but
i
have
no
other
style
reference
for
comparison
certainly
one
of
the
very
best
smoked
beers
ive
had
the
creamy
mouthfeel
subdues
the
unique
flavors
a
little
and
just
makes
this
more
drinkable
another
reason
to
try
anything
from
brasserie

this
is
a

beer
with
fine
soft

very
refreshing
from
the
makers
of
the
perfect

a
darker
slightly
smoky
version
of
the
same
what
more
could
you
ask
for
as
a
winter
surprise
settle
in
folks
nice
intro
to
a
smoked
beer
still
predominately
a
belgian
amber
i
have
to
confess
i
ordered
this
one
not
knowing
it
was
smoked
and
wondered
the
whole
time
where
the
bandaid
and
gauze
thing
came
from
almost
medicinal
in
a
way
that
we
usually
associate
with
fruit
beers
but
there
is
no
fruit
here
it
is
a
relief
to
now
see
it
is
a
smoked
beer
and
that
makes
perfect
sense
the
smoke
is
light
enough
to
be
confounding
but
still
obvious
just
in
a
different
way
very
belgian
light
copper
colored
beer
came
out
darker
than
expected
from
the
tap
and
cant
hold
much
head
at
all
after
a
minute
or
too
a
medicine
nose
but
thats
smoke
and
grain
tannins
the
saison
aspect
is
lacking
for
me
its
neither
funky
or
fruity
and
really
doesnt
have
much
of
a
yeast
profile
at
all
especially
considering
its
brewer
definitely
different
i
have
not
had
much
smoked
belgian
stuff
so
this
was
a
reach
for
my
palate
i
didnt
love
it
found
it
a
league
below
other
beers
i
have
had
from
these
guys
although
i
certainly
can
appreciate
its
uniqueness
i
have
seen
some
bottles
around
too
maybe
i
will
try
it
in
that
format
and
compare
couldnt
get
past
that
the
aftertaste
was
like
formaldehyde
sampled
at
the
bruges
beer
festival
2015
prost
i
tried
to
like
this
beer
compared
to
other
smokey
beers
this
seemed
too
ashy
to
me
duponts
beer
portfolio
is
still
outstanding
i
got
this
from
my
neighbors
thank
you
guys
this
is
really
as
special
beer
a
smoked
saison
that
gushed
on
me
but
was
really
good
i
never
had
something
quite
like
it
before
i
found
it
quite
smokey
in
the
aroma
though
real
rauchbier
are
much
more
extreme
there
was
also
a
certain
earthiness
to
it
that
was
clearly
saison
yeast
a
lot
of
taste
and
relatively
low
alcohol
is
it
a
saison
or
a
smoked
beer
thats
the
question

full
rings
of

it
settles
into

frothy

smoke
is
light
in

mild
yeasty

this
would
be
a
good
springtime
drinker
while
out
grilling
or
plantingill
revisit
it
in
a
few
months
this
was
one
hell
of
an
interesting
beer
and
a
fun
one
to
experience
definite
bonus
points
for
creativity
try
this
one

you
like
to
step
outside

residual

peppery
active

this
does
not
have
the
intensity

smoked

but
does
a
superb
job
of
delivering
good
smokiness
without
the
hefty
malt
body
of

the
balance
between
the
saison
and
smoke
is
just
about
perfect
a
bit
on
the
spritzy
side
with
overactive
carbonation
but
i
did
not
lose
any
opening
the
bottle
so
all
is
forgiven
its
been
a
long
time
between
new
smoked
beers
and
this
was
a
great
way
to
reintroduce
myself

the

when
paired
with

me
wish
i
had
left
it

flatten

lively
with
a
subtle

solid
overall
the
smokiness
dominates
the
flavor
but
it
is
not
overpowering
i
just
think
this
is
a
onedimensional
beer
nice
to
look
at
not
that
great
to
drink
d
this
is
an
odd
beer
it
doesnt
have
much
in
common
with
the
traditional
german
smoked
beers
but
manages
to
do
pretty
well
until
the
finish
there
is
a
sharp
acrid
bitterness
that
turns
the
smoke
harsh
in
the
aftertaste
if
this
wasnt
present
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
harshness
is
hard
to
ignore
overall
i
think
the
beer
is
well
made
for
what
it
is
rying
to
be
it
captures
enough
of
the
smokiness
to
make
this
amber
ale
different
without
going
overboard
or
being
a
full
rauchbier
which
some
people
may
not
enjoy
o
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
pairing
beer
but
i
am
not
too
impressed
with
it
on
its
own
overall
as
the
name
suggests
this
would
be
a
very
nice
barbecue
beer
not
too
heavy
given
the
abv
id
have
another
given
the
chance
o
interesting
beer
nothing
i
would
grab
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
othis
is
more
of
an
introduction
to
smoke
beers
its
maybe
the
most
faint
smoke
beer
ive
ever
had
which
is
amazing
because
its
one
of
the
strongest
ive
had
too
as
an
amber
ale
its
still
just
okay
d
a
really
okay
beer
not
great
but
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
would
absolutely
pair
well
with
some
smoked
or
roasted
meats
which
i
will
try
at
some
point
cheers
meh
mild
smoke
not
much
else
to
offer
very
smooth
and
ceamy
soft
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
ive
tried
this
on
draft
and
found
it
to
be
a
better
drinking
experience
from
the
bottle
while
grilling
some
meat
this
beer
pairs
well
with
grilled
meats
but
otherwise
doesnt
stand
up
on
its
own
overall
big
fan
of
bryan
voltagios
cooking
and
restaurant
volt
in
frederick
is
fabulous
this
beer
doesnt
stand
alone
very
well
and
is
not
an
easy
drinker
for
summer
perhaps
i
should
have
saved
it
to
sample
with
a
bbq
sandwich
or
ribs
as
recommened
i
could
see
how
it
would
pair
with
that
style
of
cooking
since
the
smoked
flavors
are
very
mild
and
in
the
backround
of
this
beer
and
could
enhance
the
flavor
of
food
not
very
sessionable
and
not
a
beer
to
sit
with
after
mowing
the
yard
as
its
not
very
refreshing
definitely
something
that
should
not
a
continued
line
by
flying
dog
unless
done
in
small
batches
for
sale
at
local
bbq
restaurants
or
eateries
certainly
a
must
have
for
the
beer
advocate
beer
is
thin
in
body
with
a
strong
dry
smoke
finish
as
far
as
smoke
beers
go
this
is
a
good
one
i
enjoy
the
mild
sweetness
up
front
with
a
dry
smoky
finish
it
gets
a
little
harsh
at
the
end
with
the
more
you
drink
but
id
have
it
again
would
make
a
great
cooking
solvent
nice
smoky
porter
that
does
what
it
should
without
impressing
excessively
but
it
tastes
well
nevertheless
miles
better
than
the
last
couple
from
the
style
that
i
have
tried
definitely
a
smoked
beer
but
luckily
it
doesnt
stink
of
ham
or
worse
and
can
be
drank
with
ease
the
balance
is
good
in
this
one
and
bar
the
hints
of
bacon
right
at
the
end
of
the
aroma
overall
amazing
this
is
a
really
great
beer
with
only
a
few
pondering
wonders
but
it
is
good
that
the
wonders
and
questions
are
pretty
minor
and
i
guess
a
little
nit
picky
this
is
a
beer
i
will
definitely
be
buying
again
great
quality
comparable
to
schlenkerla
and
just
as
fine
and
wonderful
i
keep
at
least
one
schlenkerla
in
my
stash
at
anytime
this
would
be
another
great
smoke
beer
to
do
the
exact
same
with
and
hopefully
i
will
have
the
chance
again
in
the
future
to
do
just
that
really
tasty
i
like
what
they
were
going
for
here
the
smell
and
subtely
smoky
taste
profile
hold
a
really
respectable
complexity
and
the
smoked
malt
is
incorporated
so
as
to
give
a
permeating
character
but
not
overly
dominate
the
beer
making
it
still
a
tasty
quaffable
porter
balance
is
great
one
of
the
better
smoked
beers
ive
tried
this
is
worth
the
effort
really
wellexecuted
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
not
much
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
the
beer
smells
of
dark
malt
chocolate
and
some
mild
smokiness
the
beer
doesnt
have
as
much
smokiness
as
i
would
want
in
a
smoked
beer
but
the
flavors
are
of
dark
malt
and
chocolate
as
well
as
smoke
unfortunately
this
bottle
yields
an
old
beer
flavor
so
i
cant
get
a
full
impression
of
what
might
have
been
a
smokier
beer
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
the
beer
is
still
pretty
drinkable
despite
being
old
this
is
a
good
beer
lots
of
chocolate
and
sweet
liquirice
fresh
and
fruity
light
body
perfect
winter
porter
the
ideal
porter
would
have
been
a
couple
of
percent
stronger
and
even
richer
and
with
a
longer
finish
but
this
beer
is
only
6
i
could
drink
it
all
night
and
i
have
overall
a
really
nice
dark
and
smokey
beer
could
drink
it
all
day
strikes
a
nice
balance
with
the
sweetness
and
meaty
character
overall
quite
a
nice
smoked
porter
o
the
aroma
of
dark
fruits
milk
and
dark
chocolate
and
peat
was
very
inviting
unfortunately
its
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
im
not
impressed
i
could
smell
this
all
day
though
t
mmedium
bodied
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
flavors
the
smoke
is
present
but
much
more
subtle
than
in
the
nose
finishes
with
a
lingering
coffee
ground
taste
overall
solid
porter
minimal
smokiness
o
jolly
good
beer
great
porter
dr
quite
nice
slightly
high
abv
and
good
quality
i
could
easily
down
quite
a
bit
i
wish
the
cost
was
just
a
little
lower
overall
a
nice
smoked
porter
with
absolutely
perfect
balance
an
awesome
smoke
porter
i
would
definitely
buy
again

hit
this

a
smoky
punch
in

but
do
want
a
good
sipping
thinking
beer
overall
its
an
easy
drinker
a
bit
sweet
at
times
though
the
smokiness
seems
to
counter
that
quite
well
nice
and
balanced
a
worthy
brew
for
sure
d
d
nice

right
here
not
as
good
as

its

a

however
must

if
you
like
smokey
beers
light

average
mouthfeel
one
of
the
best
from

decent

pours
a
near
black
color
with
some
cola
like
highlights
at
the
edges
the
light
brown
head
is
fairly
small
and
quicked

settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
and
smoked
malt
with
some
meaty
and
tin
notes
perhaps
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
the
smoke
hits
right
off
the
bat
in
the
flavor
profile
its
not
overly
strong
but
its
the
most
predominate
flavor
the
smoke
bring
some
char
and
meaty
flavors
as
well
the
malt
seems
that
of
a
traditional
porter
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
but
not
too
thick
or
too
roasty
some
dark
fruit
notes
as
well
by
the
looks
of
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
heavy
dare
i
say
stout
porter
but
its
not
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
tingly
carbonation
drinks
quite
crisp
and
easy
finishes
with
a
roasty
bitterness
i
enjoy
a
nice
smokey
beer
and
this
didnt
disappoint
i
think
the
smoke
was
in
proper
balance
with
the
malt
a
must
try
for
those
who
like
smokey
brews
d
nils
oscar
dont
make
bad
beers
this
one
is
really
nice
try
it
you
like

google
translate
confirms
it
rök
means
smoke
how
very
creative
nils
oscar
it
pours
a
nearly
opaque
blackbrown
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
glowing
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
everything
youd
want
in
a
smoked
porter
smoked
ham
charcoal
roasted
malts
ashy
molasses
and
a
rather
sweet
brown
sugar
the
taste
follows
closely
though
the
charcoal
and
roasted
malts
are
given
starring
roles
compared
to
the
other
castmates
a
decent
bit
o
spruce
finds
its
way
in
as
well
but
not
enough
to
challenge
the
supremacy
of
the
smokey
elements
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
roastily
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
tasty
smoked
porter
one
to
definitely
seek
out
this
is
the
best
nils
oscar
ive
had
a
super
easy
and
yummy
to
drink
smoke
nothing
to
trade
for
our
go
nuts
searching
for
but
if
you
are
in
sweden
and
see
it
get
it
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
tan
head
head
retention
is
pretty
good
and
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
smoked
and
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
nice
lingering
smoky
finish
also
i
think
the
smoke
is
stronger
in
the
taste
than
it
is
compared
to
the
aroma
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
it
has
moderate
carbonation
this
brew
is
very
easy
to
drink
its
pretty
smooth
and
quite
enjoyable
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
beer
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
the
next
time
i
see
it
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
is
a
got
starter
for
people
who
want
to
learn
to
appreciate
smoke
beers
a
really
good
beer
for
a
dark
and
cold
night
pours
out
a
warm
opaque
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
tan
head
that
does
not
hang
around
very
long
aroma
is
rich
sweet
and
smoky
with
a
definite
undertone
of
fine
roast
coffee
flavor
is
rich
and
smooth
smoky
with
a
coffee
undertone
and
a
strong
hint
of
unsweetened
chocolate
just
slightly
sweet
texture
is
thick
smooth
and
quite
fizzy
leaving
a
smoky
and
unsweet
chocolate
finish
this
beer
finishes
out
fairly
light
in
body
for
a
darker
beer
with
a
tangy
smoke
character
that
holds
on
to
the
tongue
after
the
beer
has
gone
nice
to
see
people
making
smoked
beers
this
one
could
use
a
little
more
of
the
smoke
however
to
run
with
the
rest
of
em
i
think
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
all
in
all
after
the
nose
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
but
the
taste
didnt
quite
live
up
i
forget
what
i
paid
for
this
but
i
know
it
was
at
least
56
for
the
one
bottle
for
about
4
i
can
get
a
stone
smoked
porter
that
destroys
this
plus
i
get
more
would
i
visit
this
beer
again
if
it
was
free
i
would
for
the
smell
alone
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
most
drinkable
smoked
porter
that
ive
come
across
at
least
very
solid
i
am
not
huge
on
smokey
beers
but
this
is
pretty
good
for
me
it
is
not
overwhelming
for
a
smoked
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
will
definitely
buy
more
bottles
of
this
overall
this
is
a
solid
smoked
porter
thats
well
worth
a
shot
bottle
pours
black
with
a
small
light
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
roasted
meats
but
overall
just
smokey
some
cigarette
smoke
some
firewood
smokiness
one
of
the
smoked
beers
that
has
more
smokiness
as
opposed
to
meatiness
flavor
is
woodsysmokey
with
light
smoked
meats
in
the
background
some
bitter
chocolate
notes
too
this
is
more
of
a
smoky
smoked
beer
as
opposed
to
a
smoky
meats
smoked
beer
which
is
not
really
my
preference
but
otherwise
i
cant
really
fault
the
beer
into
a
fluted
tulip
glass
this
poured
jet
black
with
a
glint
of
ruby
in
the
meniscus
when
held
to
the
light
the
nose
was
all
smoke
fairly
clean
and
dry
flavors
of
carob
bittersweet
chocolate
pipe
tobacco
bitter
earthy
char
smoke
was
prevalent
yet
not
overwhelming
it
was
like
having
campfire
smoke
on
your
clothes
after
a
camping
weekend
long
aftertaste
of
roasty
char
that
seemed
to
linger
forever
before
long
i
needed
another
sip
as
it
reminded
me
what
i
was
missing
split
a
bottle
with
botham
but
could
have
finished
12
easily
bottle
had
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
brownblack
with
short
loosely
knit
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
lightly
smokey
aroma
but
not
bacony
tilts
more
toward
the
ash
side
taste
is
about
the
same
ashy
smoke
flavors
married
with
a
dry
porter
flavor
of
roasted
grains
that
are
kept
fairly
restrained
smooth
and
beefy
mouthfeel
i
like
this
beer
and
it
would
be
great
with
a
cheese
plate
but
it
doesnt
rise
to
the
level
of
excellence
that
the
schlenkerla
beers
do
d
quite
a
good
beer
the
smoky
character
isnt
that
overwhelming
so
its
rather
easy
to
drink
nothing
is
really
spectacular
about
it
but
nothing
seems
out
of
place
either
a
well
crafted
brew
recommended
this
one
was
a
real
pleasure
to
consume
delicious
o
underwhelming
and
misnamed
easily
the
least
impressive
of
the
mutiny
fleet
ive
encountered
and
the
only
one
ontap
drink
i
liked
it
def
above
average
but
just
need
a
bit
more
complexity
to
me
the
body
was
dark
brown
and
opaque
like
almost
every
other
porter
around
but
this
one
had
a
pretty
big
tan
colored
head
too
the
smell
was
sweet
chocolate
hints
of
coffee
and
very
mild
smoke
the
taste
was
fantastically
smooth
with
lots
of
vanilla
toffee
chocolate
and
a
smoky
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
velvet
like
and
soothing
to
the
maximum
very
impressive
offering
from
a
brewery
that
usually
does
not
entice
me
enough
tasty
and
enjoyable
but
lacking
complexity
and
rather
off
style
overall
a
good
drinking
beer
however
it
was
lacking
the
smoke
for
a
smoked
beer
would
go
well
with
a
little
deep
purple
playing
in
the
background
a
fairly
subtle
smoked
beer
that
grew
on
me
not
one
i
would
seek
out
though
o
smoke
on
the
water
is
an
interesting
beer
it
is
quite
different
from
the
other
smoked
porter
ive
had
stones
and
is
worth
a
taste
for
the
curious
the
smoke
is
present
but
definitely
not
to
the
level
one
would
think
from
the
name
and
packaging
an
enjoyable
brew
nonetheless
still
this
is
a
nice
little
quaffer
from
hugh
of
halethorpe
generally
tasty
but
lacking
any
complexity
whatsover
and
really
whats
wrong
with
that
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
ot
the
tap
check
it
ut
for
thine
own
self
smoke
onthe
water
the
fire
in
the
sky
flavor
is
sweet
choclate
and
molasses
then
rolls
to
roasted
malt
and
finally
a
little
bit
of
campfire
ash
very
little
mind
you
as
a
smoked
porter
this
fails
but
as
a
robust
porter
i
like
it
dont
expect
smoke
but
it
is
a
solid
malty
big
porter
that
isnt
boozy
but
seems
big
on
each
sip
o
this
brew
is
tasty
but
kind
of
uninspired
the
smoke
doesnt
really
take
center
stage
much
more
of
a
subtlety
than
its
namesake
infers
drinkability
good
beer
just
not
a
smokey
as
the
title
of
the
beer
o
pretty
good
beer
not
incredibly
interesting
or
complex
but
fairly
solid
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
still
good
overall
a
tasty
warming
porter
i
think
the
smoke
is
an
asset
and
not
at
all
overwhelming
o
not
bad
not
the
best
smoked
porter
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
delivers
what
it
says
it
will
looks
amazing
very
dark
with
dark
head
very
generous
foam
smells
nice
a
smokey
like
a
barbeque
taste
is
okay
however
the
booze
knocked
my
socks
off
in
a
bad
way
very
solventy
counldnt
finish
the
beer
overall
this
is
far
too
sweet
far
too
strange
tasting
sweet
grape
juice
and
smoke
just
dont
mix
and
not
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
at
all
its
drinkable
but
also
kind
of
gross
i
wont
be
having
this
again
overall
nice
balance
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
84
a
nice
medium
bodied
porter
very
drinkable
and
definitely
a
must
try
for
the
beer
advocate
o
a
very
likeable
beer
i
could
see
myself
sipping
this
on
a
cold
winter
evening
while
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
overall
a
nice
smoked
porter
that
is
a
really
solid
portrayal
of
the
style
i
think
the
age
of
the
beer
actually
was
added
to
this
rather
than
subtracted
nothing
outstanding
but
very
solid
black
pour
with
a
nice
brown
head
retention
isnt
great
smoky
smell
light
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
really
smokey
like
the
smell
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
balanced
taste
but
a
bit
light
and
thin
medium
bodied
carbonated
well
dry
aftertaste
and
no
hint
of
alcohol
very
tasty
very
drinkable
not
a
big
taste
but
its
put
together
very
well
o
if
you
dont
like
smokey
beers
please
look
elsewhere
as
for
me
i
grill
fish
on
cedar
planks
several
times
a
month
maybe
more
and
i
plan
on
getting
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
for
those
outings
nice
aroma
and
flavors
i
did
not
like
this
beer
as
a
smoked
beer
im
sorry
i
just
didnt
get
much
smoke
from
it
at
all
but
i
made
appreciative
i
really
do
love
porter
noises
as
i
drank
the
rest
of
my
share
rich
aroma
is
smoky
with
strong
tones
of
sweet
chocolate
molasses
and
quality
coffee
and
hints
of
licorice
and
caramel
it
pours
a
warm
deep
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
finebubbled
tan
head
delightful
smoky
flavor
has
tones
of
caramel
chocolate
toffee
and
molasses
with
a
bit
of
coffee
texture
is
silky
smooth
and
on
the
thick
side
and
leaves
a
nice
tingle
overall
this
is
a
good
malty
porter
with
some
smoke
ive
tried
several
smoked
porters
this
one
stacks
up
this
is
a
very
drinkable
delicious
and
balanced
smoked
porter
this
would
be
a
great
place
to
start
if
youre
just
getting
into
smoky
beers
the
smoke
here
is
just
right
133rd
low
on
smoke
again
in
the
flavor
department
unfortunately
however
the
beer
overall
is
actually
pretty
tasty
bready
fruitladen
yeastiness
with
malts
that
are
soft
and
chocolaty
abv
is
well
hidden
and
has
a
soft
lightly
creamy
mouthfeel
carbed
just
about
right
kiss
of
smoke
and
light
vanilla
as
it
warms
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
i
like
it
would
bump
up
some
more
though
if
it
were
more
smoky
smoke
on
the
water
is
a
great
offering
for
anyone
wanting
to
have
a
taste
of
smoked
beer
without
traveling
too
far
down
that
rabbit
hole
i
hesitate
to
consider
it
a
training
wheel
smoke
beer
however
because
the
smoke
is
far
from
its
main
or
most
marked
feature
its
simply
one
of
many
and
probably
the
least
appreciable
at
that
still
this
recipe
has
really
brought
out
the
best
in
both
smokedthings
and
porters
recommended
d
a
nice
porter
easy
drinking
wouldve
been
better
on
a
colder
night
and
could
use
a
little
more
smoke
but
still
a
decent
beer
overall
an
extremely
tasty
brew
if
only
all
smoked
beers
tasted
like
this
the
cpj
i
love
smoke
beers
personally
i
think
ive
found
one
of
my
favorite
styles
the
rauchbier
is
where
its
at
in
my
opinion
heavy
seas
did
a
decent
job
for
this
smoked
porter
the
store
manager
at
the
brier
creek
total
wine
more
in
north
carolina
recommened
this
to
me
good
choice
this
would
go
well
with
a
good
cheese
burger
a
burger
with
some
swiss
cheese
and
some
onions
paired
with
this
would
match
well
with
the
smoky
flavor
dont
forget
the
bacon
as
well
this
would
also
be
great
with
steak
even
better
with
a
steak
that
was
marinated
with
bourbon
overall
a
good
beer
but
could
have
been
much
better
with
some
more
smoke
to
it
easy
to
drink
as
is
but
doesnt
leave
a
big
impression
do
recommend
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
shipped
back
from
indy
rotation
not
shipping
worthy
if
avail
near
me
it
would
make
the
occasional
rotation
as
i
do
love
smoke
but
would
be
bigger
player
if
they
upped
the
smoke
content
oy
d
its
definitely
not
very
smoky
but
this
is
a
big
solid
enjoyable
porter
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
lots
of
smoked
character
you
may
disappointed
but
it
does
add
a
nice
bit
of
depth
here
a
nice
beer
despite
some
stylemarketing
inconsistencies
drinkability
a
good
if
a
little
sweet
porter
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
smoke
in
this
one
drinks
like
an
imperial
higher
abv
porter
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
thick
tan
head
some
small
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
but
the
smoke
is
quite
faint
flavour
is
fairly
sweet
no
smoke
really
shows
up
in
the
aftertaste
either
smooth
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
beer
just
not
enough
smoke
for
a
smoked
beer
relatively
recently
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
poured
brownish
with
two
fingers
of
beige
head
great
head
retention
and
lacing
and
little
visible
carbonation
smelled
more
of
dry
coffee
beans
and
bittersweet
chocolate
and
only
modestly
of
smoke
the
taste
began
on
a
lightly
smokey
note
followed
by
a
pleasant
coffee
midpalate
and
a
chocolatemocha
finish
mediumthickness
noncarbonated
and
smooth
very
tasty
and
nicelybalanced
beer
but
i
would
like
a
little
more
smokiness
this
is
just
off
the
mark
in
every
way
dont
bother
d
decent
flavor
and
mild
feel
make
it
easily
drinkable
good
porter
but
nothing
that
will
make
me
remember
it
the
mutiny
fleet
series
of
beers
from
clipper
city
ranges
from
good
the
great
pumpkin
hang
ten
to
decent
holy
sheet
big
dipa
below
decks
to
disappointing
siren
noire
imperial
chocolate
stout
smoke
on
the
water
falls
squarely
into
the
middle
group
bottom
line
worth
the
first
bottle
but
probably
not
worth
a
second
very
drinkable
beer
but
just
not
enough
smoke
for
a
smoked
beer
imho
d
average
drinkability
again
rather
lackluster
with
no
hidden
surprises
or
bells
mediocrity
in
excitement
and
just
after
a
few
sips
this
quickly
becomes
a
boring
chore
and
felt
there
was
little
if
anything
left
to
explore
or
appreciate
after
finishing
my
early
prejudice
was
justified
kinda
weak
for
a
big
series
beer
that
strives
to
be
middle
of
the
road
a
small
beer
packaged
in
a
big
bottle
doesnt
necessarily
make
it
so
taste
begins
with
sweet
darkness
rich
through
the
middle
with
a
lightly
bitter
close
still
not
sure
if
im
getting
any
smoke
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
if
it
says
smoke
on
the
label
four
times
it
had
better
be
evident
as
a
brew
good
but
as
a
smoked
beer
fail
d
i
like
my
porters
to
be
a
little
heavier
the
flavors
were
certainly
there
it
was
a
fun
ride
however
i
have
enjoyed
better
beers
by
heavy
seas
black
with
a
big
white
soapy
head
mild
smoke
aroma
a
bit
thin
for
a
beer
for
the
style
but
smoke
in
the
taste
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
kens
bottle
pleasant
enough
drinking
middle
of
the
road
in
the
smoked
style
sweetish
smoke
though
not
overly
sweetish
its
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
if
youre
ok
with
smoke
beers
its
high
in
alcohol
but
it
comes
across
gently
with
only
a
slight
taste
and
just
a
hint
of
warming
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
rich
chocolate
and
black
malt
scent
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
smoked
malt
aroma
its
more
sweet
with
a
touch
of
roasted
character
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
bitter
black
malt
flavor
along
with
a
nice
chocolate
malt
presence
the
smoked
character
is
tame
at
best
its
most
noticeable
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
not
much
of
a
smoked
ale
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
smoke
but
i
also
get
some
roasted
malt
nice
aroma
but
not
real
complex
the
flavor
is
better
with
a
lot
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
smoke
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
smoked
porter
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nice
porter
dont
see
why
this
is
more
of
a
smoked
beer
than
alaskan
smoked
porter
enjoyed
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
isnt
good
for
me
not
only
was
i
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
smoked
malt
flavor
i
found
it
to
have
some
pretty
below
average
porter
characteristics
as
well
the
sugary
sweetness
that
came
through
was
just
not
good
to
me
i
believe
i
had
the
same
negative
experience
with
their
big
dipa
too
so
maybe
its
something
they
add
to
more
than
one
of
their
bigger
beers
unfortunately
this
is
another
one
of
their
big
beers
i
wont
be
buying
again
reviewing
with
style
in
mind
doesnt
fare
well
for
this
beer
it
should
have
had
some
smoke
to
it
at
least
drinkability
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
lacks
depth
to
make
it
truly
great
i
would
be
willing
to
have
this
again
but
its
not
a
firstchoice
brew
d
nice
enjoyable
drink
was
something
different
for
sure
with
the
smoke
taste
didnt
have
any
other
real
strong
flavors
or
qualities
d
i
may
have
to
get
the
bomber
or
at
least
try
it
again
during
the
librarys
happy
hour
a
truly
good
porter
to
have
for
3
dollars
a
pint
notes
not
a
bad
offering
from
the
heavy
seas
series
but
not
a
remarkable
one
either
and
while
a
decent
porter
the
smoked
sense
is
so
small
that
is
almost
unnoticeable
dont
know
much
about
the
smoked
beer
style
never
had
a
beer
with
smoked
malt
that
im
aware
of
so
this
was
little
harder
to
review
it
wasnt
my
favorite
it
was
missing
something
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
better
dark
smoky
beers
out
there
that
i
would
choose
before
this
one
this
was
pretty
drinkable
not
necessarily
all
at
once
but
i
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
big
two
to
three
finger
head
on
average
pour
deep
tan
in
hue
yet
airy
and
light
keeps
an
even
surface
with
no
dimpling
lacing
shows
highly
credible
stickiness
jet
black
color
looks
like
most
imperial
stouts
the
nose
is
almost
all
milk
to
dark
chocolate
with
coffee
ice
cream
and
licorice
so
much
malt
you
just
start
wondering
where
the
smoke
is
touch
of
pork
rinds
and
oats
no
significant
hops
presence
comes
across
like
a
chocolaty
porter
more
than
a
smoked
beer
mediumbodied
firm
presence
in
the
mouth
if
perhaps
kinda
immobile
albeit
without
the
massiveness
chocolate
cocoa
mocha
in
spades
light
coffee
roast
sliver
of
grapefruit
citrus
helps
stiffen
things
no
real
fruit
maybe
apricot
or
peach
pit
carbonation
is
smooth
bubbles
up
now
and
then
not
a
major
factor
candy
character
doesnt
bring
out
much
earth
tobacco
or
herbal
qualities
maybe
some
brazil
nuts
or
cashews
biggest
issue
is
that
its
just
monochrome
with
no
sense
of
development
or
subtler
nuances
but
tastes
good
mouthfeel
is
excellent
keeps
things
going
longer
than
the
flavor
profile
does
on
its
own
occasionally
however
i
get
a
sort
of
chalky
finish
so
i
am
alternately
excited
and
nonplussed

goes

easy
i
think
its
a
good
porter
but
not
quite
smoky
enough
for
me
for
being
a
smoked
porter
i
think
it
should
have
more
smoke
aroma
and
flavor
in
the
brew
ive
had
both
weyerbacher
fifteen
and
nils
oscar
rökporter
recently
and
i
think
those
are
both
much
smokier
than
this
brew
with
that
being
said
i
still
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
an
excellent
beer
very
well
balanced
with
the
smoked
malt
mingling
superbly
with
the
other
malt
characteristics
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
and
drinkability
is
hindered
only
by
the
heavyhanded
and
somewhat
complex
intermingling
of
flavors
as
well
as
the
somewhat
chewy
full
body
overall
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
but
a
well
made
beer
nonetheless
an
interesting
flavored
beer
poured
grapeish
black
with
a
tan
head
smelled
smokey
cocoaish
taste
sort
of
like
a
burnt
brown
ale
considering
it
was
labled
as
a
smoked
porter
i
was
expecting
something
more
porterlike
it
wasnt
a
bad
flavor
by
any
means
but
i
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
either
would
have
gone
good
with
some
sort
of
chocolate
overall
this
was
a
smoothdrinking
smoked
porter
and
another
solid
beer
from
the
mutiny
fleet
well
worth
a
shot
bomber
from
ouav
south
richmond
va
i
will
choose
to
review
this
on
the
merits
as
a
porter
this
really
isnt
a
smoked
or
even
much
of
a
smoked
porter
a
descent
baltic
like
porter
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
at
kappys
in
medford
tonight
smoke
on
the
water
pours
out
a
nice
black
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
heading
nose
is
of
moderately
dark
chocolate
and
some
brown
bread
very
little
smoke
can
be
detected
in
the
nose
here
surprisingly
the
taste
has
hardly
any
smoke
either
perhaps
a
hint
at
best
more
dark
chocolate
and
fruit
come
through
making
this
more
similar
to
a
straight
up
american
porter
than
a
smoked
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
and
drinks
well
while
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
it
is
simply
not
what
the
label
claims
is
i
am
sure
they
did
smoke
this
beer
but
there
is
little
evidence
to
support
that
theory
from
the
smell
or
taste
if
you
are
looking
for
a
simple
decent
porter
this
one
should
work
those
seeking
the
smoke
should
look
elsewhere
drinkability
personally
i
found
it
to
be
a
flimsy
porter
imparted
with
a
lackluster
smoke
character
and
therefore
an
unappealing
brew
i
tried
this
a
week
later
out
of
the
bottle
at
a
dear
friends
cookout
same
results
sadly
d
a
very
drinkable
porter
especially
for
the
abv
although
i
keep
stopping
myself
from
typing
stout
as
this
is
a
robust
brew
but
not
as
advertised
at
least
in
the
batch
this
bottle
came
from
as
the
smoke
component
is
nonexistent
i
still
liked
the
beer
quite
well
though
as
it
brings
a
nice
flavor
punch
of
chocolate
coffee
and
tobacco
hops
notes
i
can
hear
those
crunching
opening
chords
now
this
guy
pours
a
pretty
much
opaque
blackbrown
topped
by
a
nice
finger
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
has
some
light
smokey
notes
but
mostly
its
roasted
malts
not
much
else
in
there
really
though
some
light
chocolate
and
caramel
dart
hither
and
yon
like
frightened
hummingbirds
the
taste
is
similarly
dominated
by
the
roasted
malts
backedup
by
some
brown
sugar
molasses
cocoa
and
caramel
a
lovely
kiss
of
peat
smoke
comes
in
near
the
middle
surrounding
the
other
flavors
cradling
them
all
the
way
home
lovely
the
body
is
a
nice
medium
with
a
relatively
light
carbonation
and
a
sliky
smooth
feel
one
of
the
best
heavy
seas
brews
yet
and
a
very
tasty
smoked
porter
overall
get
some
d
a
decent
smoked
beer
im
glad
i
tried
would
try
again
d
very
drinkable
enjoyable
to
drink
with
a
quite
delicious
aftertaste
iam
closer
to
giving
up
on
the
heavy
series
after
this
offering
wich
was
decent
but
just
not
good
enough
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
deep
dark
brown
with
only
a
hint
of
of
ruby
when
held
to
the
lighta
fluffy
almond
colored
head
atop
aromas
are
dominated
by
smokeother
bas
said
not
enough
smoke
i
say
too
muchnot
much
else
came
thru
other
than
some
bitter
chocolate
flavors
are
one
dimentional
in
the
smoke
categorya
hint
of
unsweetened
choclate
comes
thru
otherwise
it
has
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
as
well
just
not
enough
going
on
hereyeah
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
smokiness
but
not
much
elseiam
losing
hope
in
the
below
decks
series
drinkability
this
is
smooth
and
goes
down
fast
enjoyable
22oz
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
deep
almost
opaque
black
with
a
decent
frothy
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
barely
leaves
any
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slight
brown
malts
and
just
a
trace
of
smoke
the
taste
is
an
unusual
blend
of
espresso
and
smoked
malt
with
just
a
trace
of
hops
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
some
sticky
lingering
alcohol
ill
admit
i
did
not
get
my
hopes
up
on
this
one
especially
after
the
smoked
porter
highland
released
last
year
that
was
so
great
oh
well
the
mutiny
fleet
seems
to
be
getting
back
to
its
not
so
great
roots
this
pours
a
watery
midnight
black
with
a
slight
khaki
colored
head
the
smell
isnt
over
powering
i
thought
it
would
be
smokier
it
smells
like
a
rich
dark
roast
coffee
that
carries
over
to
the
taste
the
flavor
is
rich
and
coffee
like
with
little
smokiness
its
pretty
standard
as
for
the
mouthfeel
its
a
little
watery
compared
to
other
porters
its
appealing
but
nothing
overly
special
this
one
is
drinkable
but
not
one
of
clipper
citys
best
the
letter
of
marquee
is
a
better
option
at
least
on
cask
i
dont
get
more
then
a
hint
of
smoke
but
otherwise
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
releasing
an
imperial
porter
in
the
middle
of
summer
seems
a
bit
odd
but
otherwise
i
thought
this
latest
offering
from
clipper
city
to
be
very
enjoyable
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
retains
ok
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
litte
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
upfront
along
with
some
smoked
meat
salt
burnt
bread
some
blackberry
and
a
little
alcohol
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
bacon
and
smoked
meat
flavor
along
with
a
little
sea
salt
some
dark
chocolate
espresso
black
cherry
burnt
bread
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
a
decent
smoked
porter
not
particularly
complex
or
interesting
but
tasty
nonetheless
taste
resembles
a
light
smoked
porter
with
hints
of
coco
and
lightly
hopped
its
little
below
average
for
the
style
mainly
coco
taste
with
a
smoked
taste
drinkability
this
beer
was
really
a
decent
porter
but
forget
the
fact
this
is
smoked
as
there
is
barley
a
hint
of
smokiness
here
not
what
i
expected
as
i
wanted
some
more
smokiness
pours
a
syrupy
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
light
tan
head
the
head
starts
off
initially
large
and
billowy
before
quickly
fading
to
a
thin
film
with
one
or
two
large
clumps
of
lacing
and
a
lot
of
random
small
spots
of
lace
that
slide
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
aroma
is
disappointing
in
the
amount
of
smoke
as
it
smells
like
a
typical
roasty
porter
mild
sweetness
artificial
chocolatelike
similar
to
siren
noire
attempts
to
balance
out
the
roasty
charred
aromas
but
unfortunately
the
smell
of
stale
ashtray
dominate
not
the
type
of
smoke
hoped
for
similar
to
the
recent
rye
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
way
off
for
the
style
syrupy
and
watery
with
little
carbonation
and
significantly
lacking
in
overall
body
malt
body
flavor
has
a
slightly
more
smokey
taste
than
the
aroma
would
have
suggested
but
milk
chocolate
sweetness
ends
up
dominating
throughout
and
in
the
finish
there
also
seems
to
be
a
potent
boozy
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
which
is
disappointing
for
this
abv
and
style
the
aftertaste
has
the
strongest
smokey
flavor
returning
to
the
unpleasant
stale
ashtray
of
the
aroma
not
really
a
great
example
of
a
american
porter
smoked
porter
or
smoked
beer
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
not
as
bad
a
beer
as
my
score
suggests
but
doesnt
really
compare
to
beers
like
alaskans
smoked
porter
or
even
captain
lawrences
