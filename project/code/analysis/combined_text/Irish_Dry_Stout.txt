overall
very
drinkable
but
in
no
way
exciting
or
memorable
it
could
use
a
touch
more
sweetness
but
i
guess
that
might
take
away
from
its
sessionability
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
revisit
this
one
again
final
thoughts
well
im
glad
this
beer
taught
me
about
black
currants
in
beer
but
i
dunno
i
was
impressed
at
the
start
of
the
beer
but
it
gradually
became
more
and
more
tame
as
the
carbonation
panned
out
its
good
but
the
problem
i
have
is
if
i
wanted
a
stout
this
wouldnt
be
what
i
was
looking
for
this
is
more
like
a
milder
porter
so
keep
that
in
mind
if
you
pick
it
up
o
a
very
drinkable
stout
which
is
in
line
with
all
of
the
brews
i
have
had
from
hockley
good
but
not
great
definitely
worth
another
taste
some
time
soon
i
love
it
drinkability
here
is
definitely
high
especially
at
this
abv
4
2
on
this
can
i
could
easily
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
short
period
of
time
not
sure
that
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
would
be
a
good
choice
if
youre
looking
for
an
incredibly
sessionable
stout
in
ontario
dnot
bad
i
will
drink
the
other
one
i
have
it
seems
like
hockley
valley
sacrificed
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
stout
that
nailed
the
appearance
and
smell
to
make
it
incredibly
easy
to
put
down
i
look
at
hockley
valley
as
a
mediocre
brewery
and
this
is
far
from
their
best
offering
ill
take
a
guinness
over
this
d
it
seemed
a
lot
more
watery
then
the
last
time
i
had
this
one
but
it
has
a
better
feel
and
taste
then
other
dry
stouts
guinness
dont
pursue
this
one
if
youre
looking
for
bold
flavors
but
its
still
not
too
bad
also
it
has
a
4
2
abv
not
4
6
d
high
nice
low
abv
but
really
nice
flavours
to
keep
a
night
going
pours
a
dark
brown
with
thin
tan
head
head
dissipates
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
has
a
very
nutty
smell
with
some
mild
coffee
and
chocolate
roast
taste
has
mild
bitterness
body
is
a
bit
thin
i
used
to
enjoy
this
stout
a
lot
more
i
dont
know
if
my
tastes
have
changed
with
trying
more
beers
or
if
the
beer
has
still
a
nice
enough
stout
for
ontario
the
only
issue
i
would
have
with
this
nice
coffee
hinted
stout
would
be
a
better
head
formation
and
retention
dare
i
say
larger
cans
with
a
nitro
ball
i
would
be
glad
to
have
this
on
a
regular
basis
and
i
hope
the
newfoundland
liquor
board
keeps
bringing
this
beer
in
overall
an
okay
stout
low
abv
and
goes
down
easy
could
throw
a
few
back
no
problem
per
the
label
pours
like
liquid
midnight
midnight
must
be
darker
down
here
because
the
pour
was
more
darkbrown
than
black
minimal
head
on
hard
pour
even
for
a
style
that
is
not
assertive
and
focuses
on
being
easy
to
drink
this
fell
on
the
timid
side
of
the
scale
a
tad
watery
and
sour
with
pleasant
but
insufficient
roasted
malt
flavor
i
was
impressed
by
this
stout
as
it
was
full
bodied
with
good
roasty
bitterness
yet
smooth
on
the
finish
add
to
it
a
low
abv
and
put
it
in
a
can
and
i
think
it
hit
the
mark
i
enjoyed
the
chocolate
nose
coupled
with
burnt
malt
and
found
the
midbody
well
balanced
too
bad
its
not
available
in
bc
a
passable
local
stout
probably
one
of
the
better
locals
available
on
regular
lcbo
rotation
still
theres
a
few
serious
flaws
with
it
the
metallic
after
taste
and
the
thinness
that
need
addressing
edit
perhaps
slightly
better
in
the
can
carbonation
seems
more
in
check
though
perhaps
still
slightly
on
the
heavy
side
less
smoke
comes
through
a
little
more
as
roast
more
bland
than
wrong
in
this
format
nothing
to
get
excited
about
d
nah
not
worth
seeking
out
initially
pours
a
jet
black
body
with
a
generous
tan
head
however
both
the
head
and
lacing
quickly
subside
as
the
beer
warms
results
in
a
boring
black
coffee
look
about
midway
through
smell
taste
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
a
little
bit
of
coffee
dried
grains
and
almonds
lightly
charred
aftertaste
very
flavourful
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
mouthfeel
smooth
and
lightbodied
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
finish
is
only
somewhat
dry
overall
a
tasty
stout
and
above
average
for
the
style
but
the
brewer
could
improve
the
head
retention
lacing
and
mouthfeel
for
a
truly
impressive
beer
worth
a
try
a
good
beer
overall
i
like
it
i
like
this
beer
the
upfront
creaminess
for
the
dry
lowalcohol
session
beer
standard
is
very
enjoyable
fairly
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
its
easy
to
throw
back
but
it
feels
a
little
thin
a
little
more
body
would
be
nice
swing
top
bottle
from
the
lcbo
pours
deep
deep
brown
almost
black
with
some
transparency
the
head
is
frothy
beige
and
keep
for
a
while
the
aromas
are
mild
roasted
coffee
beans
charred
wood
vanilla
nice
malt
and
hops
as
well
tastes
of
roasted
malts
some
dark
chocolate
vanilla
extract
coffee
beans
finishes
creamy
and
just
a
touch
waterier
than
i
prefer
good
beer
from
this
brewer
nicely
done
and
a
very
solid
drinkable
irish
stout
without
really
wowing
in
any
one
department
not
bad
id
probably
get
it
again
for
something
different
though
its
not
my
favorite
stout
aroma
of
coffee
and
chocolate
neither
is
overly
strong
taste
has
a
lot
of
coffee
and
some
chocolate
malt
detected
some
nuttiness
as
well
not
much
sweetness
keeping
to
the
dry
stout
characteristics
kind
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
not
really
watereddown
just
lightered
than
expected
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
get
it
again
if
i
could
thanks
bobsy
thin
bodied
and
its
almost
watery
and
wet
yeah
wet
its
drinkable
enough
but
probably
not
something
id
reach
for
too
often
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
my
biggest
complaints
are
the
thin
mouthfeel
and
the
sweetness
is
a
little
too
much
but
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
ill
buy
it
again
very
drinkable
though
part
of
that
may
be
the
low
abv
but
its
also
just
a
pleasant
malty
smooth
beer
to
drink
down
fairly
thin
a
little
bit
creamy
but
right
on
par
with
an
irish
stout
more
wet
then
dry
however
which
should
be
noted
coffee
flavors
are
elicited
and
oats
are
present
as
well
which
alter
this
beer
from
its
a
style
in
a
different
way
some
slight
maple
syrup
sweetness
which
is
something
i
find
characteristic
of
many
canadian
beers
this
is
an
interesting
beer
a
thank
you
goes
out
to
the
ba
that
threw
this
one
in
as
an
extra
the
aroma
was
good
nice
coffee
notes
and
some
slight
chocolate
flavor
was
a
bit
lacking
but
not
a
bad
beer
i
am
not
sure
how
stout
it
is
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
watery
not
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
stout
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
for
some
reason
i
feel
as
if
all
beers
made
in
canada
are
pilseners
with
a
little
specialty
malt
good
for
a
change
if
you
are
in
teh
great
white
north
overall
a
very
good
dry
stout
for
sure
the
appearance
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
the
rest
of
the
experience
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
and
could
easily
be
a
session
stout
this
would
definitely
be
a
staple
if
i
lived
in
the
area
very
dark
brown
with
faint
chestnut
highlights
and
a
reddish
hue
a
thick
rocky
tan
cap
appeared
after
the
pour
fair
head
retention
with
some
clumpy
lacing
mild
aroma
some
dry
roast
caramel
and
toffee
light
coffee
and
a
hint
of
hops
light
bitterness
a
bit
of
roast
light
grassy
and
herbal
character
plus
more
caramel
sweetness
light
to
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
mild
dry
astringency
from
the
dark
grains
very
low
carbonation
that
made
it
feel
sort
of
lifeless
okay
overall
the
only
problem
i
had
with
it
was
the
too
low
carbonation
thanks
to
nash
for
the
can
d
this
is
really
really
quaffable
a
real
winner
thanks

the
aftertaste

a
bit
thin
this
beer
on
tap
won
a
blind
stout
and
porter
tasting
at
cest
what
a
few
months
ago
which
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
28
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
molasses
black
colour
with
a
light
brown
head
that
quicklt
disappeared
the
aroma
was
rather
weak
with
some
roasted
malt
hints
and
some
sour
smells
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
roasted
malt
with
coffee
and
chocolate
tones
drinkability
too
heavy
to
be
a
session
beer
but
nice
pours
like
a
stout
dark
with
a
relatively
large
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
there
was
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
alcoholic
undertones
the
taste
is
quite
good
each
sip
is
a
new
experience
some
are
quite
bitter
others
have
some
sweetness
to
them
this
beer
is
pretty
carbonated
for
a
stout
but
its
not
overbearing
very
drinkable
i
like
it
as
far
as
irish
style
stouts
go
this
is
not
a
bad
one
certainly
worth
a
try
theres
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
at
all
but
its
a
little
bland
i
doubt
i
will
pick
it
up
again
all
in
all
a
decent
offering
but
it
wont
replace
the
hockley
dark
for
me
when
i
visit
ontario
can
poured
a
deep
black
color
ale
with
a
small
dirty

foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
no

of
black
chocolate
with
light
dry
bitter
coffee
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
light
bitter
coffee
notes
with
some
nice
black
chocolate
notes
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
with
some
medium
carbonation
this
beer
was
enjoyable
and
refreshing
and
well
done
for
the
style
overall
its
not
too
bad
an
effort
easy
to
drink
a
bit
watery
for
my
taste
could
be
improved
upon
but
certainly
easy
to
drink
not
a
great
stout
not
a
bad
stout
just
a
stout
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
one
it
poured
an
extremely
thin
head
almost
nonexistent
the
smell
didnt
excite
me
in
the
way
a
decent
stout
can
the
taste
was
not
bad
but
i
was
hoping
to
be
granted
a
treat
its
a
bit
to
close
to
bacon
water
and
stale
coffee
even
at
that
its
still
better
than
a
crappy
rice
brewed
lager
tastes
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
a
good
drinkable
stout
but
it
falls
short
in
a
few
places
pretty
decent
stout
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
head
and
better
taste
large
one
litre
swing
top
bottle
poured
black
quite
dark

one
finger

i
thought
this
looks
like
a
stout
alright
a
bit
flat
unfortunately
smell
was
of
toast
slightly
burnt
toffee
taste
had
measures
of
bitterness
roasted
malt
not
bad
at
all
hint
of
chocolate
nice
finish

a
malty
aftertaste
this
is
by
no
means
a
great
stout
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
well
received
in
ontario
where
locally
brewed
stouts
are
not
always
easy
to
find
thanks
hockley
valley
like
drinking
coffee
that
got
cold
not
horrible
coffee
but
just
another
thin
and
dry
stout
fizzy
carbonation
that
helps
to
generate
an
acidic
undercurrent
two
cups
are
ok
but
a
litre
flip
top
not
complex
a
passable
beer
a
bit
of
roast
barley
a
dark
brown
colour
and
a
bubbling
transparent
amount
of
head
d
very
nice
not
very
heavy
but
full
flavoured
aroma
is
dry
plantlike
with
a
little
coffee
and
tobacco
restrained
but
pleasant
and
more
complex
than
say
guinness
flavour
is
excellent
roasted
malts
moderate
dry
coffee
little
bit
of
chocolate
surprising
amount
of
smokiness
nice
dry
finish
with
some
lingering
sweetness
for
me
this
falls
somewhat
short
of
my
favourites
i
e
shakespeare
stout
but
still
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
time
the
mouth
feel
was
extremely
thin
this
is
a
good
stout
but
its
overpriced
at
10
dollars
a
bottle
grains
some
coffee
and
chocolate
but
not
as
fullbodied
flavourful
and
fulsome
as
you
might
expect
a
stout
to
properly
be
an
underachiever
nonetheless
still
competently
made
and
worth
a
try
at
least
love
the
bottle
great
for
my
homebrew
cost
is
a
bit
high
my
initial
impression
observing
sniffing
and
finally
tasting
this
beer
was
wow
this
is
a
great
stout
fruits
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
thick
black
color
with
a
nice
dark
tan
cascade
and
thick
dense
dark
tan
head
with
excellent
retention
and
some
lacing
the
beer
gave
off
a
very
light
much
lighter
than
expected
roasted
malt
aroma
with
perhaps
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
the
beer
had
a
nice
malty
taste
that
one
would
expect
from
a
dry
stout
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
the
beer
had
a
good
moderate
feel
to
it
and
it
was
smooth
creamy
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
but
my
favorite
is
still
beamish
overall
this
is
a
very
nicely
flavorful
irish
stout
the
body
is
full
for
the
style
and
this
one
is
very
flavorful
d
nicely
done
and
a
better
than
average
version
of
a
be
that
few
craft
breweries
attempt
drinkability
amazing
beer
nice
dry
and
sweet
this
is
my
new
favorite
in
the
style
very
true
to
the
style
yet
pleasantly
complex
this
one
may
be
better
than
their
pils
overall
a
nice
easy
going
flavorful
session
brew
big
flavorlow
abv
what
else
is
not
to
like
about
this
drinkability
easy
drinking
but
not
necessarily
worth
it
with
other
stouts
around
d
very
drinkable
this
was
a
great
mix
of
flavor
and
feel
especially
on
the
nitro
tap
so
this
is
something
i
will
be
looking
for
again
d
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
packs
a
nice
punch
of
taste
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
keeps
it
interesting
ive
had
this
this
several
times
now
each
time
on
nitro
and
each
time
its
a
dependably
decent
brew
love
the
nitro
and
its
ultracreamy
pour
cascade
action
leaves
an
inch
thick
compact
velvety
khakicolored
head
atop
of
the
pitch
blackness
below
the
scum
left
behind
is
immaculate
being
served
via
nitro
the
aroma
can
range
from
quite
muted
to
a
soft
roasted
bitter
not
a
wide
spectrum
but
for
what
style
it
is
it
suggests
something
weightier
or
more
substantial
in
density
and
concentration
of
flavor
and
feel
than
say
guinness
draught
which
essentially
is
dirty
water
lovely
smooth
more
bitter
than
roasty
taste
real
creamy
actually
hangs
on
the
palate
nicely
ive
had
it
with
a
more
relaxed
degree
of
nitro
and
the
flavors
really
blossom
hints
of
industrial
coffee
and
some
vague
nuttiness
they
really
nailed
the
style
as
i
sometimes
confuse
it
for
murphys
though
its
still
better
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
americanmade
irish
dry
stout
and
the
flavor
profile
and
low
abv
are
perfect
for
an
allday
session
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
black
in
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
faint
roasty
malt
in
the
taste
grassy
and
a
small
dry
roasty
malt
a
smooth
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
bitter
aftertaste
quite
thin
and
lacking
in
flavor
and
aroma
drinkability
is
decent
a
nitro
stout
with
nothing
out
of
place
but
not
a
whole
lot
stands
out
a
fair
attempt
at
a
guinness
imitation
brand

poured
a
with
a
creamy
onefinger
head
which
settled
to
creamy
offwhite
coating
lacing
was
abundant
and
lasting
nose
was
some
chocolate
roasted

and
coffee
taste
was
dry
and
moderately
bitter
heavy
roasted

some
chocolate

burnt

very
creamy
and
wellcarbonated
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
a
beer
that
was
3
6
abv
but
clearly
you
could
down
a
few
of
these
without
damage
a
decent
offering
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
t
this
beer
has
a
nice
smooth
vegetable
celery
flavor
to
it
for
a
stout
it
has
a
bit
of
tart
chocolate
taste
but
very
smooth
once
down
d
fairly
drinkable
and
not
as
thick
and
one
might
perceive
still
nothing
overwhelming
either
good
or
bad
stouts
arent
my
favorite
style
but
ive
tried
several
and
have
begun
to
appreciate
them
pours
black
with
huge
dense
undulating
head
that
takes
several
minutes
to
settle
down
aroma
is
roasted
like
bitter
chocolate
or
smoke
and
evident
at
a
distance
flavor
is
sharp
and
coffeelike
bitter
roasted
like
an
excellent
campfire
deep
caramel
round
nutty
bitterness
mouthfeel
powerful
thick
and
creamy
insanely
creamy
dit
does
bring
some
flavor
and
is
very
low
in
body
seeing
the
alcohol
content
just
now
i
realize
why
it
is
so
light
i
guess
i
should
give
it
a
higher
score
bc
you
could
drink
this
all
day
and
never
get
drunk
but
personally
id
rather
get
drunk
fast
and
drink
something
i
enjoy
d
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
while
the
mouthfeel
seemed
to
be
almost
spot
on
for
what
i
was
expecting
the
taste
could
have
used
a
little
bit
more
robustness
with
the
roasted
notes
overall
still
a
nice
beer
overall
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
get
the
chance
excellent
irish
stout
actually
prefer
this
over
that
other
well
known
irish
stout
overall
exceptional
drinker
i
could
see
myself
having
many
of
these
over
a
course
of
an
evening
prefer
this
over
guinness
and
victory
donnybrook
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
it
pairs
exceptionally
well
with
food
and
is
not
obtrusive
with
other
flavors
the
lacing
is
great
in
my
opinion
has
overtones
of
coffee
and
nut
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
brownish
tinge
very
thick
light
tan
head
forms
drops
a
ton
of
lace
on
its
way
down
settles
to
a
very
thick
layer
very
creamy
looking
bit
light
in
colour
for
a
stout
though
smell
is
alright
grainy
and
sweet
some
caramel
light
roast
and
chocolate
toasty
bitterness
some
raisins
and
dark
fruit
not
too
bad
taste
is
very
dry
and
grainy
at
first
caramel
sweetness
toast
light
roast
and
chocolate
oatscereal
very
dry
in
the
finish
light
on
flavour
but
nice
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
and
drinkable
just
a
bit
too
light
to
be
great
but
a
decent
irish
stout
nitro
tap
at
the
tap
and
malletblack
big
creamy
head
creamy
mouthfeel
coffee
grounds
for
taste
roast
and
onedimensional
that
of
course
is
mediocre
compared
to
the
stout
i
want
to
drink
also
not
overally
dry
would
like
more
stout
flavour
maybe
in
a
bottle
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
but
a
good
alternative
to
some
other
irish
stouts
overall
a
nice
irish
style
lighter
stout
that
cant
rival
the
serious
stouts
but
sly
fox
made
it
that
way
this
beer
was
made
to
enjoy
as
a
light
offering
that
one
could
drink
anytime
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
pick
again
if
i
was
heading
to
sly
fox
since
so
many
of
their
other
beers
are
kick
ass
dont
get
me
wrong
i
would
drink
one
anytime
but
there
are
beers
i
enjoy
more
from
them
this
is
exactly
what
an
irish
dry
stout
should
be
just
plain
delicious
its
a
very
creamy
body
with
a
thick
head
and
lacing
the
flavor
is
a
slightly
milky
deep
roasted
flavor
with
an
aroma
to
match
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
oh
so
drinkable
find
this
and
get
someone
else
to
drive
you
home
look
is
a
solid
stout
appearance
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
surprisingly
light
finger
of
nice
offwhite
head
that
leaves
impressive
lacing
as
the
beer
goes
down
nose
is
fairly
mild
pretty
dry
roasted
malt
smell
a
touch
sour
i
guess
this
is
what
gives
the
beer
a
little
more
character
sourness
comes
through
throughout
the
beer
very
limited
sweetness
roasted
malt
as
well
feel
is
creamy
and
full
bodied
solid
overall
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
the
sourness
might
be
a
little
limiting
i
prefer
my
stouts
a
little
sweeter
although
that
might
not
be
this
style
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
example
of
a
subtle
but
flavorful
low
abv
beer
overall
an
easy
stout
to
drink
not
the
boldest
of
flavors
but
solid
and
a
good
beer
to
finish
the
day
with
super
dark
black
with
a
creamy
velevetty
thick
cappucino
head
on
top
some
interesting
things
in
the
nose
besides
the
usual
roasted
barley
with
a
soft
coffee
and
slight
bitter
chocolate
there
was
also
bbq
liquid
smoke
bacon
roasted
hot
pepper
i
didnt
find
those
when
i
tasted
the
beer
maybe
a
little
smokyness
but
i
did
get
the
coffee
and
chocolate
and
a
little
tin
not
huge
and
finishes
with
a
metallic
coffee
flavor
and
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
flowing
on
a
nitro
tap
at
trivia
pub
in
moon
township
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
appears
black
especially
in
the
lighting
of
this
grundgy
pub
tan
head
forms
thick
and
lasts
awhile
and
forms
lacing
with
each
sip
from
the
pint
aroma
is
a
bit
muted
with
touches
of
dark
chocolate
and
light
coffee
notes
a
bit
of
an
herbal
hop
finish
but
really
nothing
stands
out
flavor
profile
is
solid
a
clean
well
balanced
dry
irish
stout
that
goes
down
with
ease
and
has
some
of
that
tartness
lactic
edge
that
guinness
has
light
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
presence
finishes
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
dead
on
to
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
in
body
with
creamy
nitrogenated
carbonation
drinkability
is
with
ease
and
the
abv
being
so
low
this
one
is
definitely
a
sessionable
brew
cheers
a
pretty
solid
black
coffee
colored
brew
with
a
very
modest
offwhite
circle
of
thin
bubblage
on
top
and
decent
traces
of
lace
the
aroma
suggests
a
woodsy
skunk
malt
with
a
roasted
peat
edge
not
bad
the
taste
brings
on
a
thin
harsh
charcoal
with
bitter
cider
mash
malt
some
grassy
ash
tray
ideas
here
not
bad
but
the
body
is
closer
to
light
with
a
very
thin
aqueous
feel
and
very
little
carbonation
good
but
not
great
friend
of
an
irishman
is
no
ones
friend
it
poured
out
a
deep
and
headless
brown
the
aroma
was
slightly
acrid
like
rotting
humus
the
taste
was
of
burnt
coffee
and
acidified
chocolate
also
a
touch
too
sweet
for
a
dry
stout
it
actualy
tastes
somehow
weak
bodiedas
if
you
were
to
take
a
very
old
batch
of
murphys
or
guinness
and
add
10
more
water
slightly
bitey
aftertaste
friend
of
an
irishman
stout
pours
a
black
color
with
not
much
head
lots
of
carbonation
looks
like
a
coke
there
is
a
smooth
smell
with
hints
of
coffee
a
smooth
taste
creamy
strong
coffee
flavors
on
a
rather
smokey
malty
backbone
very
nice
full
flavor
stays
on
the
tongue
overall
a
very
solid
dry
stout
enjoyable
and
different
from
the
market
favor
guinness
overall
it
was
a
average
dry
irish
stout
and
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
would
likely
do
better
in
a
nitrogen
driven
fashion
o
ive
seen
variety
packs
from
christian
moerlein
at
party
town
in
florence
ky
and
never
picked
one
up
but
i
might
have
to
now
that
ive
seen
the
quality
has
returned
to
christian
moerlein
brews
cheers
this
one
started
off
bad
and
ended
not
so
bad
i
was
expecting
this
one
to
be
like
otr
which
i
hated
and
this
one
surprised
me
a
little
better
than
expected
drinkability
this
overall
is
a
solid
stout
worth
a
try
if
available
and
if
you
are
a
stout
fan
solid
all
around
i
could
set
a
few
back
relatively
easy
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
this
did
not
hit
the
mark
for
an
irish
dry
more
english
than
irish
color
was
dark
black
but
a
bit
thin
as
light
penetrated
around
the
edges
no
creamyness
to
the
mouthfeel
or
the
dryness
associated
with
the
style
a
tad
watery
with
distinct
coffee
notes
and
an
undercurrent
of
slight
oxidation
thanks
to
my
friend
dave
for
sharing
a
bottle
overall
id
say
this
is
an
accurate
interpretation
of
the
style
it
has
appropriate
body
and
bitterness
when
many
americanmade
irish
stouts
are
too
heavy
and
chocolatey
however
the
flavor
is
pretty
tame
it
finishes
with
the
traditional
black
coffee
and
roast
bitterness
but
upfront
theres
just
a
mellow
smooth
sweetness
that
emphasizes
the
blandness
like
i
said
the
finish
is
spot
on
and
theres
a
lovely
mild
mocha
aftertaste
but
overall
the
character
is
lacking
and
i
think
im
picking
up
hints
of
oxidation
d
all
night
baby
so
odd
so
different
i
want
to
buy
a
case
dark
brown
pour
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
dies
quickly
aroma
is
quite
acrid
and
oddly
nutty
tough
to
describe
really
the
flavor
is
along
the
same
lines
only
worse
an
odd
acrid
nuttiness
burnt
sugar
lip
gloss
the
body
is
light
and
watery
overall
this
is
just
a
poor
beer
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
tumbler
glass
the
liquid
is
very
dark
and
opaque
but
i
can
see
some
bubbles
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
head
is
thin
tan
and
made
up
of
small
bubbles
it
disappeared
almost
immediately
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
but
mostly
smells
like
burnt
embers
and
toasted
malts
its
not
great
but
i
like
it
there
is
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
to
the
flavor
and
some
coffee
bitterness
it
is
very
pronounced
and
lingers
for
a
while
after
i
swallow
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
there
isnt
much
of
a
coating
so
the
beer
feels
watery
the
carbonation
is
very
low
its
lower
than
i
would
like
it
overall
the
beer
goes
down
well
enough
but
it
doesnt
have
any
outstanding
characteristics
to
make
it
stand
out
amongst
the
many
beers
in
this
style
that
are
available
to
me
i
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
beers
down
if
offered
to
me
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
one
again
the
nose
is
nice
and
roasty
with
simple
straightforward
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
the
taste
follows
suit
but
adds
some
crisp
bittering
bite
into
the
mix
definitely
highly
drinkable
but
not
as
light
and
airy
as
guinness
d
im
trying
very
hard
to
find
something
positive
about
this
beer
but
its
not
easy
it
pours
with
a
nice
head
and
has
some
pleasant
if
simple
aromas
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
leave
much
to
be
desired
d
a
very
meh
experience
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
ive
definitely
had
a
lot
better
beers
from
christian
moerlein
tastes
like
there
were
some
quality
control
issues
on
this
beer
i
may
rereview
at
a
later
time
if
i
have
some
in
the
future
but
dont
hold
your
breath
even
with
the
quality
control
issues
there
are
better
dry
stouts
out
there
skip
over
this
one
and
just
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
otr
d
something
was
off
with
this
beer
the
smell
was
inviting
but
the
taste
was
just
not
all
there
interesting
flavor
profile
with
the
creaminess
but
just
didnt
work
for
me
not
a
total
drainpour
but
will
not
drink
this
again
d
i
was
forced
to
drink
this
because
of
obama
i
ejoy
him
as
a
president
but
do
not
find
this
to
be
of
drinkability
far
better
irish
stouts
but
i
have
not
found
one
not
worth
a
ticket
not
a
bad
beer
just
some
loose
ends
that
need
to
soften
the
bitterness
and
id
have
enjoyed
it
more
12
oz
bottle
pours
out
an
opaque
murky
brown
with
little
head
i
love
the
color
smells
of
freshly
ground
coffee
with
vanilla
and
chocolate
notes
i
pick
up
all
the
same
in
the
taste
with
maybe
a
more
definitive
milk
chocolate
taste
i
really
like
how
the
bitter
of
the
coffee
balances
the
sweet
malts
tastes
really
good
my
only
criticism
of
this
stout
is
that
it
feels
a
little
too
light
in
the
mouth
but
then
again
that
keeps
it
refreshing
and
drinkable
cheers
appropriately
named
lets
give
it
a
whirl
twist
off
top
but
i
pop
it
with
an
opener
bottle
smell
yields
milk
chocolate
and
fine
colombian
coffee
pours
to
dark
brown
brew
that
lets
only
a
shimmer
of
light
of
any
through
head
is
consistently
medium
bubble
and
light
tan
taste
is
a
burnt
chocolate
with
a
sweetness
and
a
slight
bitterness
that
accompanies
well
but
doesnt
override
the
toasted
malts
a
very
tasty
selection
lots
of
flavor
for
a
4
7
abv
i
like
the
dry
finish
and
the
lack
of
heavy
weight
i
would
seek
this
out
over
all
macro
stouts
any
day
of
the
week
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
and
headed
out
to
the
patio
the
color
resembled
pure
black
coffee
with
a
light
brown
head
head
was
gone
quick
the
beer
almost
looked
flat
half
way
through
smells
of
chocolate
coupled
with
a
certain
smokiness
or
roastiness
not
sure
if
thats
a
word
those
aromas
fell
right
into
the
taste
it
felt
very
bubbly
almost
over
carbonated
at
certain
parts
not
to
sure
whats
up
with
that
a
sweet
dry
aftertaste
not
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
in
the
future
but
maybe
it
was
just
do
to
the
whole
mouthfeel
issue
edit
has
another
bottle
of
this
after
waiting
a
great
while
and
it
appears
as
though
the
first
had
some
issues
all
of
the
carbonation
issues
i
had
initially
were
not
present
in
the
second
tasting
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
pours
an
obsidian
color
with
a
2
finger
white
head
no
lacing
it
has
a
burnt
coffee
aroma
with
a
little
sweetness
mild
coffee
flavor
throughout
leaves
a
mild
charcoal
flavor
not
as
bad
as
it
sounds
it
finishes
dry
a
bit
thin
really
dont
think
they
added
many
oats
the
carbonation
is
good
and
it
is
easy
drinking
while
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
it
is
a
decent
brew
not
bad
overall
highlight
is
definitely
the
smell
like
nothing
id
smelled
before
decent
enough
drinker
i
might
have
a
few
in
a
row
if
given
the
chance
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
with
a
slightly
above
average
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
also
seems
a
little
on
the
thin
side
compared
to
more
favorable
brews
this
is
something
that
is
not
difficult
to
drink
but
it
is
not
impressive
in
any
ways
slightly
disappointing
compared
to
other
stouts
but
overall
not
bad
d
goes
down
very
easy
will
drink
the
other
two
but
would
not
purchase
again
this
is
a
very
light
thin
and
crisp
stout
not
sure
it
fits
the
dry
stout
category
well
as
its
like
a
stout
light
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
almost
watery
with
crisp
carbonation
which
borders
on
champagnelike
and
makes
this
brew
extremely
drinkable
a
good
stout
for
anyone
who
really
enjoys
an
easy
flowing
and
relatively
tasty
stout
i
enjoyed
how
light
this
beer
was
as
well
as
how
easy
it
was
to
drink
if
guinness
sets
the
stout
standard
then
this
beer
can
run
with
the
pack
since
it
had
good
flavor
and
went
down
very
easy
d
i
have
another
to
drink
and
i
am
not
looking
forward
to
it
it
is
going
to
sit
for
awhile
and
hopefully
served
to
someone
else
overall
an
o
k
stout
although
a
bit
thinbodied
and
bitter
finishing
overall
this
really
could
have
been
a
lot
better
it
was
really
just
messy
and
did
not
work
on
really
any
level
drinkability
is
ok
as
long
as
your
expecting
a
thinner
bodied
brew
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
coffee
bean
finish
poured
from
a
cellartemperature
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
thin
tan
head
quickly
dissipates
into
a
lacy
skim
over
this
black
opaque
brew
the
smell
is
of
roasted
coffee
or
espresso
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
perhaps
oak
the
vanilla
flavor
really
comes
forth
in
the
flavor
and
the
coffee
moves
into
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
coffee
flavor
lingers
pleasantly
in
the
mouth
there
is
very
little
bitterness
to
this
beer
just
enough
to
add
some
pleasant
complexity
carbonation
is
light
and
just
right
but
the
mouthfeel
is
less
creamy
than
i
frequently
encounter
in
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
tasty
stout
not
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
but
one
which
i
wouldnt
mind
having
many
of
my
prevailing
perception
of
this
beer
was
zzzzzz
it
was
quite
boring
even
for
an
irish
dry
stout
a
frequent
discussion
thread
on
this
sight
and
others
is
good
gateway
beer
for
a
budmillercoors
drinker
and
i
would
nominate
this
beer
that
is
not
intended
as
a
compliment
this
beer

moderately
high
for
something
that
is
listed
as
a
stout
its
not
especially
heavy
and
the
flavors
arent
overpowering
or
challenging
solid
all
around
and
very
affordable
for
the
quality
if
purchased
as
a
sixer
at

it
is
a
perfect
enhancer
for
all
manly
mealspizza
curries
grilled
burgers
or
sausages
pasta
with

in
an
ideal
world
this
would
be
the
basic
stout
served
everywhere
with
premium
stouts
offered
where
there
are
lots
of
taps
i
enjoy
drinking
these
north
coast
brews
that
have
no
faddish
flavorings
but
are
simply
beautiful
products
of
a
remarkable
brewer
who
is
an
artist
with
the
basics
kinda
sweet
for
a
stout
for
me
but
could
be
good
for
people
that
have
only
had

wtf
i
just
want
to
rate
this
beer
why
do
i
have
to
write
a
review
i
found
38
to
be
very
good
across
the
board
nothing
elaborate
on
the
nose
or
the
palate
just
a
straightforward
stout
that
moves
along
nicely
front
to
back
would
definitely
drink
it
again
basic
stout
pretty
drinkable
and
to
the
point
stout
pours
a
deep
brown
with
hardly
any
light
getting
through
the
head
is
creamy
tan
and
burns
off
quickly
leaving
small
amounts
of
lacing
dark
malts
dominate
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
and
earthy
hops
adding
to
it
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
just
not
quite
as
robust
and
forward
the
body
is
thinner
has
a
hit
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
dry
finish
rich
round
and
sweet
nice
roasty
character
on
the
aftertaste
o
pretty
darn
solid
stout
pours
thick
black
with
a
lace
of
head
smells
like
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
at
first
sip
its
very
sweet
but
goes
down
smooth
and
ends
with
a
little
bitterness
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
stout
an
alright
stout
didnt
blow
me
away
would
try
again
roasted
almost
smoky
malt
chocolate
and
faint
coffee
solid
o
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
stout
delicious
flavor
and
nice
aroma
would
buy
again
smooth
roasted
coffee
alcohol
a
good
stout
not
exceptioanl
but
very
drinkable
has
a
good
creamy
texture
excellent
flavor
good
body
a
winner
o
a
very
good
beer
thats
a
pleasure
to
drink
it
isnt
a
monster
of
a
stout
but
it
drinks
nicely
and
has
good
flavors
overall
a
solid
brew
could
be
a
regular
go
to
but
there
are
a
lot
of
similar
beers
out
there
kind
of
depends
on
whats
next
to
it
overall
a
very
good
dry
stout
o
totally
lacking
in
malt
character
and
one
dimensional
but
still
quite
drinkable
o
this
is
a
great
stout
enjoyable
during
any
season
doesnt
require
a
superdark
beer
mood
the
coffee
is
so
impressive
yet
that
is
only
one
aspect
to
this
beer
this
is
my
summerstout
o
i
could
definitely
drink
this
if
it
were
offered
but
im
just
not
the
biggest
fan
of
thinner
stouts
overall
not
bad
nice
stout
flavors
over
carbonated
and
that
weird
back
end
bitter
herbal
yeasty
thing
thats
hard
to
describe
and
takes
away
a
bit
not
a
lot
of
hops
which
could
have
been
a
bit
more
still
pretty
nice
beer
overall
this
is
exceptional
for
the
price
but
well
done
within
its
own
merit
overall
a
nice
irish
stout
not
the
driest
out
there
in
terms
of
its
sweetness
but
a
very
nice
and
easy
drinker
none
the
less
very
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
huge
off
white
head
that
takes
a
few
to
recede
aromas
of
roast
and
hints
of
caramel
dried
fruit
and
chocolate
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
slightly
tart
roasted
grains
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
chocolate
meidum
bosy
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
decent
stout
i
could
drink
it
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
overall
at
5
6
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
a
solid
put
together
irish
dry
stout
grab
me
another
overall
really
a
very
nice
stout
and
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
flavors
are
nicely
bold
complex
and
very
well
balanced
fills
the
mouth
during
the
quaff
and
finishes
with
a
subtle
dryness
with
a
whiff
of
astringency
definitely
worth
a
try
o
an
easy
drinking
stout
sessionable
for
the
style
scents
of
plums
and
chocolate
on
the
nose
nice
outrageously
huge
3
finger
head
dark
as
a
good
stout
should
be
many
complex
flavors
including
chocolate
coffee
and
hazelnuts
a
classic
american
made
stout
goes
down
so
smoothly
low
bitterness
and
it
makes
you
want
the
next
sip
great
session
beer
and
i
am
probably
a
bit
biased
because
this
was
one
of
my
first
microbrewed
stouts
and
im
glad
to
be
reunited
with
it
fairly
subtle
beer
that
hits
on
all
points
for
the
style
very
drinkable
without
all
the
bells
and
whistles
that
drag
down
some
of
the
new
kids
on
the
market
should
go
great
with
these
oysters
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
one
inch
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
tons
of
lace
smell
is
chocolate
coffee
bread
and
toffee
taste
is
all
of
that
chocolate
being
the
dominant
flavor
really
well
balanced
and
smooth
body
is
fairly
light
for
a
stout
plenty
of
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
solid
stout
not
earth
shattering
but
nice
appearance
is
very
nice
with
a
pretty
black
pour
and
i
dont
mean
ruby
the
head
comes
off
as
creamy
and
tan
but
doesnt
stick
around
long
there
is
some
lacing
for
the
duration
but
not
much
all
seems
straight
forward
but
pleasant
yes
as
advertised
no
mistaking
that
this
is
an
irish
stout
to
the
nose
you
get
plenty
of
malt
plenty
of
dark
chocolate
and
some
might
say
coffee
but
i
got
something
along
the
lines
of
creamy
black
tea
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
nothing
overbearing
very
light
on
the
palate
the
taste
is
once
again
straight
forward
and
nothing
ground
breaking
but
still
very
enjoyable
up
front
is
the
creamy
chocolate
accompanied
by
mocha
and
very
light
expresso
in
the
end
you
will
also
be
able
to
taste
a
lot
of
the
malt
and
thats
something
i
like
in
stouts
all
around
a
very
nice
beer
although
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
here
in
vegas
id
buy
it
again
if
the
price
was
right
as
this
is
a
nice
one
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there
this
is
not
a
big
beer
and
no
way
resembles
a
serious
imperial
stout
its
not
complex
and
will
remind
you
of
most
other
irish
style
stouts
but
it
still
sits
higher
on
the
shelf
than
most
recommended
pretty
solid
for
an
irish
dry
stout
o
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
all
day
i
will
buy
this
again
good
stuff
recommend
this
has
some
good
aromas
and
flavors
in
a
light
body
o
ive
been
on
a
non
imperial
stout
kick
lately
and
this
is
killing
it
for
me
would
drink
again
this
would
be
easy
to
session
fridge
staple
material
if
not
iso
worthy
the
taste
is
more
sweet
and
malty
than
the
nose
might
suggest
with
muted
coffee
but
more
forward
malts
and
butterscotch
low
bitterness
a
very
quaffable
beer
a
tasty
stout
with
great
balance
and
approachability
o
a
solid
beer
nothing
overpowering
nothing
out
of
place
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
nothing
that
was
too
out
of
place
for
the
style
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
creamy
not
to
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
its
a
pretty
easy
drinking
dark
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
its
just
what
i
want
in
an
irish
dry
stout
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
had
a
slight
stale
aspect
to
it
i
would
buy
this
again
and
i
would
like
to
try
a
bottle
that
i
know
is
fresh
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
priced
well
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
represents
the
style
nicely
and
its
pretty
easy
drinking
good
job
north
coast
ill
have
to
keep
an
eye
out

more
of
your
beers

although
for
the

its
quite
on

overall
this
is
what
a
dry
stout
should
be
bitter
dry
and
light
in
body
quality
malt
scents
and
flavors
make
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
a
pretty
good
stout
nothing
fancy
or
out
of
this
world
about
it
but
a
solid
year
round
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
i
really
dig
north

and
while
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
its
still
something
ill

im
glad
i
finally

it
d
my
only
complaint
would
be
that
this
is
a
little
too
big
of
a
body
for
a
dry
irish
stout
however
i
may
be
being
picky
not
blown
away
here
but
a
good
brew
for
sure
o

reminds
me
of

it

o
a
surprisingly
good
irish
dry
stout
flavorful
despite
low
abv
the
sweet
dark
fruits
really
mix
in
well
has
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
too
that
is
typical
of
good
irish
dry
stouts
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
its
a
bit
simple
as
you
would
expect
but
honestly
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
in
5
6
very
drinkable
too
the
old
38
i
had
finished
like
bbq
sauce
yes
bbq
sauce
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
doesnt
smell
like
it
and
theres
no
reason
to
think
of
bbq
sauce
given
that
its
a
stout
but
after
i
finished
my
pint
while
struggling
to
place
the
off
notes
i
realized
its
bbq
sauce
go
figure
is
it
maple
syrup
artificial
maple
syrup
thats
lending
those
hints
i
never
noticed
such
a
characteristic
in
other
brews
made
with
maple
but
i
definitely
found
this
hereand
corroborated
my
findings
with
others
tasting
with
me
pretty
sure
i
wont
try
this
one
again
oan
easy
drinking
stout
doesnt
bring
anything
overpowering
to
the
table
but
enough
to
enjoy
o
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
given
its
light
body
i
would
definitely
consider
this
to
be
sessionable
because
it
has
some
nice
flavors
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
during
a
single
sitting
slight
tartness
with
a
graininess
strangely
akin
to
russian
standard
vodka
strange
tangent
but
thats
whats
in
my
fridge
at
the
moment
anyhow
the
finish
is
mildly
dry
with
a
moderate
roastiness
slightly
light
on
the
mouthfeel
but
hey
it
keeps
this
stuff
really
nicely
drinkable
and
easily
likeable
i
mean
i
like
it
not
bad
at
all
o
had
two
bottles
of
this
because
the
first
tasted
like
liquid
tinfoil
second
bottle
was
good
but
this
is
still
much
better
on
tap
as
far
as
im
concerned
nevertheless
a
decent
brew
and
worth
trying
north
coasts
old
no
38
stout
is
a
simple
dry
stout
enjoyable
on
any
occasion
at
only
7
dollars
for
a
six
pack
this
beer
has
good
value
and
good
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
substantial
frothy
brown
head
and
is
aromatic
of
burnt
coffee
a
somewhat
strong
carbonation
hits
the
mouth
making
it
drinkable
but
slightly
harsh
for
a
dry
irish
stout
this
old
38
is
has
no
surprises
well
balanced
mild
but
not
watery
bitter
and
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
interested
until
the
glass
is
empty
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
get
excited
about
but
definitely
a
goto
beer
at
a
pub
and
i
would
easily
recommend
it
to
a
friend
if
this
is
north
coasts
attempt
at
making
an
entry
level
affordable
beer
to
a
wider
audience
i
think
it
hit
the
mark
and
i
wholeheartedly
approve
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
roasted
malts
taste
is
also
mild
kind
of
bland
for
this
style
some
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
coffee
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
aroma
is
bitter
charmalt
forward
with
lesser
components
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
in
the
middle
with
just
a
touch
of
fig
in
the
background
contrary
to
the
nose
the
flavor
is
mostly
toastedmalt
forward
with
less
emphasis
on
bitter
char
and
more
on
tea
and
herbal
earthy
hopping
bittering
in
this
sense
the
flavor
felt
a
bit
more
porterish
to
me
than
like
a
stout
o
this
is
a
terrific
stout
that
just
has
everything
i
look
for
when
i
want
a
simple
wonderfully
produced
stout
o
really
enjoying
this
one
and
it
cured
my
stout
fix
without
having
to
crack
open
one
of
the
yetis
or
irss
ive
been
trying
to
age
overall
delicious
stout
i
will
try
again
o
an
exceptional
stout
well
worth
seeking
out

atmosphere
is
pretty
solid

is
chocolaty
and
floral
malt
goodness
with
some
sweet
tones
woody
body
with
a
chocolaty

and

well
done
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
its
pretty
average
looking
black
with
some
lace
and
weak
head
in
my
conditions
but
the
taste
is
good
i
would
buy
again
if
i
were
seeking
a
drinkable
stout
with
a
smokey
flavor
nice
i
said
that
twice
so
it
must
be
so
pours
a
deep
brown
with
red
highlights
thick
frothy

great
looking
poor
except
a
bit
light
on
color
dark
roast
with

taste
follow
with
darkly
roasted

and

nice
and
dry
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
nice
drinker
hop
character
is
earthy
and
at
times
piney
but
the
malt
dominates
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
bittering
is
near
perfect
overall
a
very
fine
stout
full
bodied
yet
dry
overall
solid
irish
dry
reminiscent
of
guinness
extra
stout
but
a
touch
smoother
good
but
nothing
necessarily
original
overall
another
very
impressive
brew
from
north
coast
it
takes
a
bit
to
get
used
to
all
the
fruit
notes
but
the
charred
and
toasted
character
along
with
peppery
hops
lead
to
a
very
nice
balance
pick
this
up
when
you
find
it
othis
is
actually
a
decent
and
full
flavored
stout
the
smell
turned
me
off
at
first
but
the
taste
really
made
up
for
it
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
o
looking
back
on
it
i
regret
not
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
impressive
stuff
whats
not
to
like
about
this
a
beer
made
for
swilling
this
should
make
the
irish
take
another
critical
look
at
their
beamish
stout
not
as
sour
and
charred
as
the
irish
cousins
on
the
nitro
tap
at
south
park
abbey
in
san
diego
overall
real
solid
and
really
like
this
slight
fruit
angle
to
this
stout
great
stuff
o
opens
up
as
it
warms
up
yummy
pours
a
very
nice
deep
brownblack
with
wonderful
head
and
great
lacing
very
nice
deep
scent
nice
roastiness
and
quite
a
bit
sweet
maltiness
very
nice
flavors
with
a
nice
roastiness
good
earthy
finish
but
perhaps
a
bit
much
on
the
malt
sweetness
and
just
a
bit
notenoughdry
still
goes
down
smooth
and
is
a
very
nice
irish
dry
stout
just
not
as
good
as
the
guy
at
big
red
told
me
it
would
be
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
i
did
find
myself
a
bit
disappointed
the
nose
led
on
that
there
would
be
more
to
the
flavor
but
i
just
didnt
find
it
id
still
probably
try
it
again
in
the
future
but
i
have
some
more
interesting
beers
in
the
queue
that
id
rather
get
to
first
taste
is
complex
the
roasted
flavors
come
through
has
a
bit
of
a
acidic
bite
to
it
in
the
after
taste
finish
is
not
as
clean
as
i
normally
enjoy
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
refreshing
irish
dry
stout
everything
about
this
beer
is
traditional
i
would
have
this
again
for
sure
overall
it
is
a
good
stout
old
38
has
many
reasons
to
try
it
overall
not
good
i
was
hoping
for
better
after
i
saw
the
ba
score
but
i
was
really
disappointed
once
i
tried
it
d
the
smell
alone
makes
this
worth
trying
it
is
a
very
solid
stout
with
enough
action
to
turn
a
guinnessisthegreatestbeerever
type
to
craft
pours
dark
brown
with
an
abundant
twofinger
length
brown
head
holding
the
glass
up
to
the
light
reveals
a
dark
amber
color
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
theres
a
sweet
aroma
i
pick
up
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
the
sweet
roasted
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
i
can
taste
the
flavor
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
finish
is
dry
and
carbonation
is
plentiful
enough
to
aid
in
lightening
the
medium
body
each
sip
is
very
enjoyable
and
lacing
is
present
on
the
glass
this
is
a
very
crisp
stout
that
leaves
me
craving
more
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
not
a
bad
stout
my
2nd
review
for
an
irish
dry
stout
and
its
not
as
good
as
black
sun
but
its
still
pretty
awesome
in
its
own
way
a
really
standard
product
as
normal
as
a
bottle
of
stout
can
be
but
it
is
well
made
and
very
drinkable
pours
coffee
colored
dark
brown
letting
just
a
hint
of
light
in
fair
off
white
head
that
fades
out
smells
nice
and
roasty
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
tastes
stronger
than
it
is
pretty
dry
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
is
good
full
bodied
but
not
filling
and
heavy
just
enough
carbonation
crisp
for
a
stout
overall
not
something
id
rush
to
buy
again
but
a
stout
i
am
happy
to
drink
anytime
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
slight
brown
head
scent
is
wonderful
with
robust
malts
sweet
milk
cocoa
and
coffee
smooth
and
very
drinkable
taste
with
erupting
flavors
sweet
flavors
first
that
finish
with
a
dry
after
taste
a
great
pick
up
and
an
even
better
stout
would
love
to
drink
this
again
overall
impression
a
delicious
and
creamy
brew
if
only
there
was
more
attribute
coffee
chocolate
maple
syrup
etc
this
would
be
a
55
missed
the
mark
for
me
enjoyed
for
the
style
it
was
and
will
have
to
try
more
irish
dry
stouts
this
is
pretty
standard
irish
stout
fare
roasted
grains
and
a
black
coffee
bitterness
dominate
the
beer
gets
too
acidic
for
my
tastes
towards
the
end
the
overly
fizzy
body
accentuates
the
acidity
for
some
reason
outside
of
the
fizz
its
appreciably
light
and
rather
dry
overall
38s
acidity
and
harsh
carbonation
turned
me
off
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
i
didnt
o
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
that
has
great
full
roasted
malt
but
is
not
bitter
or
too
sweet
very
sessionable
overall
this
is
a
laid
back
subtle
stout
that
has
some
good
qualities
that
could
be
a
bit
amplified
o
a
very
well
done
american
irish
dry
stout
i
honestly
cant
complain
about
any
aspect
of
this
beer
its
all
good
but
it
could
definitely
be
a
tad
better
all
around
di
like
my
stouts
attenuated
a
little
less
than
this
one
but
its
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
a
very
nice
beer
overall
a
great
irish
stout
well
crafted
and
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
think
that
many
try
to
do
irish
stouts
but
fail
very
bad
too
many
try
to
replicate
guinness
but
this
one
is
better
than
guinness
just
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
perfect
winter
beer
excellent
stout
buy
some
soon
commit
yourself
to
a
six
pack
with
this
one
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
soon
poured
a
blackish
body
with
twofinger
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
and
left
nice
lace
ring
standard
aroma
of
mild
bread
roasted
dark
chocolate
malts
hints
of
coffee
and
carameltoffee
smooth
creamy
a
light
dry
sensation
as
the
roastedcoffee
malts
balance
with
some
breadinesswoodiness
for
that
lingering
dryness
that
easily
passes
the
tongue
and
is
filling
adequately
balanced
w
sweetness
by
some
chocolatecarameltoffee
simple
beer
to
drink
that
hits
the
spot
and
not
too
shabby
ooverall
a
nice
stout
one
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
not
too
heavy
a
drink
and
quite
warming
for
the
months
ahead
as
they
grow
colder
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
irish
dry
stouts
not
from
the
motherland
that
is
available
on
the
west
coast
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
didnt
get
a
very
good
head
when
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
smells
yeasty
and
piney
the
taste
is
very
roasted
a
tinge
of
sourness
that
ends
bitter
it
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
the
palette
when
i
took
the
first
few
drinks
but
im
warming
up
to
it
now
i
would
maybe
have
more
of
these
again
its
got
a
lot
of
flavor
and
body
without
the
standard
high
abv
that
goes
along
with
that
sort
of
beer
usually
still
my
favorite
stout
by
this
brewery
is
old
rasputin
by
far
slainte
o
pretty
good
likely
would
prefer
on
nitro
or
even
with
a
shot
of
espresso
in
it
overall
a
pretty
decent
dry
stout
the
dark
fruits
add
a
nice
touch
body
could
of
been
fuller
with
less
carbonation
o
its
hard
for
me
to
review
very
malty
beers
but
i
can
at
least
say
me
likey
overall
old
no
38
stout
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
is
somewhat
disappointing
given
its
10
a
six
price
at
world
market
the
most
glaring
problem
is
that
he
mouthfeel
is
off
i
can
accept
thin
bodied
in
an
irish
dry
stout
but
that
needs
to
be
compensated
by
exceptional
creaminess
which
was
absent
in
this
beer
also
the
taste
profile
is
backwards
malt
and
hop
flavors
need
to
be
dialed
up
and
the
plum
notes
dialed
down
a
decent
good
enough
stout
that
i
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
out
overall
a
nice
smoky
stout
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
way
better
tasting
than
the
smell
which
was
a
bit
offputting
i
would
consider
getting
this
again
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
i
would
reach
for
first
overall
very
very
easy
to
drink
tastly
light
smooth
nice
i
could
drink
this
all
day
has
nice
flavor
and
a
little
more
sweeter
then
i
expected
guiness
drinkers
should
give
this
a
try
really
nice
light
dry
stout
probably
the
best
dry
irish
ive
had
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
i
didnt
just
like
this
in
relation
to
its
brethren
this
is
just
a
damn
good
beer
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
ones
within
the
style
the
alcohol
was
relatively
low
in
this
allowing
for
a
nice
drinking
session
during
the
night
i
tried
this
a
glass
of
water
is
good
for
a
beer
like
this
since
this
stood
true
to
its
stylistic
name
this
is
a
bit
dry
but
extremely
accessible
and
easy
to
get
accustomed
to
fans
of
dark
beers
shouldnt
come
in
expecting
a
lot
but
will
find
it
almost
impossible
to
be
disappointed
by
this
offering
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
puffy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
nice
chunky
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
beans
and
some
slight
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
cocoa
powder
and
some
vanilla
flavors
a
mild
roasty
aftertaste
sticks
around
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
though
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
with
a
very
nice
set
of
roasty
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
decent
stout
have
had
better
just
feels
lacking
in
places
d
very
easy
to
drink
its
light
for
a
stout
and
quite
flavorful
the
lightness
makes
it
very
easy
to
have
several
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
i
will
not
seek
this
beer
out
again
its
smell
and
appearance
were
both
right
on
this
beer
was
dark
had
a
nice
head
and
gave
off
a
nice
roasty
smell
upon
tasting
the
beer
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
intense
carbonation
level
i
could
not
even
taste
the
beer
very
well
until
the
beer
settled
down
a
bit
the
finish
was
delicious
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
were
nicely
and
subtly
put
together
the
mouthfeel
ruins
this
one
for
me
very
sessionable
brew
in
the
style
of
those
stouts
that
give
you
something
full
flavoured
but
something
easy
to
stick
with
all
night
its
a
fine
achievement
and
this
is
undoubtedly
something
id
be
happy
to
drink
often
overall
i
suppose
its
not
bad
i
just
had
high
expectations
for
north
coast
considering
the
only
other
beers
ive
had
from
them
were
old
rasputin
and
pranqster
i
think
this
beer
would
be
more
enjoyable
if
it
sat
for
a
few
minutes
after
being
poured
overall
pretty
good
little
dry
stout
i
think
the
nitro
really
helps
this
beer
out
a
lot
highly
recommended
on
nitro
overall
the
lightest
tasting
stout
ive
tried
more
drinkable
than
most
stouts
a
good
intro
for
the
initiate
just
not
very
impressive
o
what
beer
lacks
for
in
taste
it
makes
up
for
in
feel
easy
to
drink
but
in
a
way
bordering
more
on
a
dark
brown
ale
nothing
too
exciting
but
it
is
quite
sessionable
overall
a
solid
stout
i
prefer
my
old
rasputin
i
think
but
who
wouldst
definitely
worth
trying
sometime
but
i
dont
think
i
will
purchase
this
one
again
pours
motor
oil
black
smells
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
toffee
taste
is
about
equal
parts
of
the
same
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
really
nothing
bothersome
though
overall
a
good
interpretation
of
a
stout
and
worth
a
try
if
you
are
looking
for
something
in
this
style
o
i
thought
it
was
more
of
a
lowhopped
american
stout
than
an
irish
dry
stout
that
being
said
its
a
decent
beer
no
matter
how
you
cut
it
nothing
too
memorable
or
that
seperates
it
from
some
of
the
other
stouts
type
of
stout
ignored
but
its
a
step
up
from
guinness
and
other
entry
stouts
still
i
would
put
it
in
the
bottom
half
of
what
ive
had
from
north
coast
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
thick
opaque
black
looks
like
tar
with
a
one
finger
chocolate
head
looks
great
and
the
light
is
impenetrable
through
the
beer
smell
is
boozy
and
slightly
sweet
the
alcohol
smell
is
slightly
off
putting
the
taste
is
good
on
the
otherhand
lacing
left
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
the
stout
has
hints
of
chocolate
but
lots
of
caramel
malts
has
a
thick
mouthfeel
that
is
rich
and
creamy
this
beer
is
pretty
good
if
it
were
more
popular
in
my
area
i
might
purchase
it
more
often
is
not
nearly
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
though
o
classic
example
of
what
a
stout
is
not
what
it
could
be
i
really
enjoy
north
coast
and
wish
they
did
something
more
with
this
but
i
guess
thats
why
they
give
us
old
rasputin
overall
this
is
a
true
to
form
an
irish
dry
stout
not
an
imperial
great
tasting
stout
just
wish
the
aroma
was
more
robust
really
enjoyed
and
would
suggest
a
try
to
all
cost
is
under
two
dollars
a
beer
so
i
will
always
have
on
hand
overall
i
was
impressed
one
of
the
better
irish
dry
stouts
ive
had
would
certainly
have
again
o
overall
a
very
solid
dry
stout
wouldnt
expect
any
less
from
this
brewery
this
might
become
a
go
to
do
i
liked
this
one
been
a
damn
long
time
since
ive
had
one
preba
days
its
a
looker
rich
and
creamy
but
not
too
filling
the
beer
is
good
i
also
love
the
train
coming
at
you
on
the
bottle
theres
a
story
behind
said
train
actually
weird
to
think
this
beer
started
as
a
homebrew
and
ended
up
being
chilled
in
my
refrigerator
a
solid
but
not
exception
dry
stout
plenty
of
flavour
and
easy
drinking
which
are
great
atributes
for
the
style
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
pretty
standard
stout
with
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
semisweet
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
molasses
basic
roasted
malts
in
the
taste
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
molasses
and
an
elusive
touch
of
sour
apple
mediumtofull
body
smooth
and
pretty
drinkable
im
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
i
love
it
in
beer
and
this
is
really
exceptional
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
pour
was
near
spot
on
for
the
style
and
really
showed
a
tremendous
amount
of
promise
dark
as
night
with
a
rich
and
creamy
tan
head
that
rose
up
from
the
bottom
and
settled
down
very
nicely
along
the
top
of
the
glass
bu
that
was
about
the
best
it
would
get
too
light
of
a
n
aroma
as
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
notes
seem
to
be
horribly
off
balance
hints
of
coffee
maybe
but
it
all
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
a
mess
for
me
to
be
honest
smooth
even
carbonation
on
a
somewhat
mellow
profile
needed
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
to
really
be
anything
worthwhile
to
me
roasted
chocolate
hints
of
tobacco
a
light
sweetness
but
again
it
really
all
seemed
terribly
off
balance
to
me
to
be
honest
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
ive
been
staring
at
the
sixer
of
this
one
at
the
store
for
a
while
this
is
a
beer
that
will
frequent
my
fridge
from
now
on
d
this
drinks
more
like
an
english
stout
it
is
a
quality
brew
if
you
dont
have
irish
dry
stout
in
mind
t
big
roasted
malt
flavors
along
with
some
subtle
smokiness
and
leather
the
mouthfeel
keeps
this
from
getting
too
heavy
but
it
keeps
the
beer
from
being
all
that
i
feel
it
could
be
this
is
a
really
solid
irish
dry
stout
with
a
major
emphasis
on
the
dry
no
major
complaints
here
poured
out
like
a
typical
irish
stout
the
black
body
with
a
tan
thick
head
the
head
had
some
pretty
good
retention
and
stuck
around
for
a
little
while
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
old
leather
and
earth
some
roasted
burnt
notes
as
well
the
taste
was
kind
of
metallic
not
really
what
i
was
thinking
itd
be
like
i
was
kind
of
turned
off
by
the
taste
of
this
beer
completely
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
batch
but
i
just
couldnt
get
over
how
much
i
disliked
the
taste
of
this
beer
everything
else
was
pretty
good
here
o
overall
a
decent
dry
stout
middleweight
contender
but
not
a
star
on
the
national
level
its
simply
lacking
depth
of
flavor
if
it
were
a
local
brew
id
probably
drink
it
often
odd
that
it
showed
up
in
a
local
beerwine
store
in
hagerstown
maryland
overall
a
pleasant
enough
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
need
to
be
bigger
to
get
better
marks
from
me
d
a
well
made
stout
its
flavor
profile
isnt
particularly
dark
for
the
style
but
it
has
enough
roasted
character
to
give
it
a
very
nice
dark
chocolate
character
in
the
finish
the
gaps
are
filled
in
with
dark
malt
that
brings
notes
of
molasses
and
licorice
to
the
table
as
well
as
a
bit
of
caramel
like
all
of
north
coasts
offerings
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
free
of
flaws
and
enjoyable
the
aroma
is
a
bit
over
the
top
for
a
dry
irish
stout
but
who
fucking
cares
this
is
an
awesome
beerim
only
disappointed
that
its
taken
me
this
long
in
getting
around
to
trying
it
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
fantastic
stout
dont
hesitate
to
try
if
its
available
in
your
area
really
good
for
an
irish
stout
different
from
traditionals
sweeter
and
less
hoppy
great
nonetheless
o
its
hard
to
say
because
of
the
strong
fruit
presence
i
get
i
like
it
but
this
is
out
of
the
norm
this
is
by
far
the
fruitiest
dark
stout
that
i
have
had
it
was
very
pleasing
but
my
tongue
got
confused
a
few
times
i
would
like
to
score
higher
but
have
to
keep
it
middle
of
the
road
since
im
between
a
rock
and
hard
place
on
this
one
north
coast
old
38
stout
has
a
black
colour
and
a
good
5
mm
head
that
fades
to
excellent
lacing
the
smell
is
roasty
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
dry
with
some
hints
bitter
coffee
the
aftertaste
is
milky
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
is
a
very
nice
dry
stout
i
like
it
and
i
dont
usually
like
this
style
the
mouthful
is
foamy
and
thick
very
nice
d
the
sour
finish
comes
and
goes
its
drinkable
but
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
unless
its
on
tap
just
to
see
if
it
tastes
any
different
review
based
on
notes
from
a
tasting
on
jan
6
2011
overall
it
looks
like
i
got
a
bad
bottle
glad
i
only
bought
one
but
i
am
sorely
disappointed
as
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
probably
not
going
to
try
and
find
another
side
note
i
did
have
a
dunkelweizen
earlier
in
the
night
but
i
dont
think
that
affected
my
palate
as
i
cleansed
it
and
i
smell
the
funk
in
addition
to
tasting
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
though
a
little
light
on
the
palate
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
standout
stout
a
good
february
beer
the
two
gentlemen
i
shared
this
brew
with
were
given
a
better
impression
than
i
fyi
though
i
still
feel
it
was
a
solid
solid
choice
for
a
stout
d
the
lack
of
creaminess
leaves
me
not
exactly
begging
for
that
next
sip
but
its
definitely
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
drinkability
pretty
solid
a
nice
surprise
from
a
style
that
can
seem
a
little
lackluster
has
been
resurrected
by
north
coast
and
that
shouldnt
surprise
anybody
nice
flavors
and
nice
scents
combine
with
a
more
than
manageable
abv
no
reason
anyone
shouldnt
enjoy
a
few
of
these
d
its
ok
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
i
remember
liking
it
the
first
time
i
had
it
despite
its
not
being
that
good
its
still
fine
to
drink
beer
is
sweet
and
medium
body
beer
has
a
coffeeish
bitterness
at
the
back
but
its
weak
the
beer
overall
is
weak
its
sweet
and
roasty
and
finishes
nicely
i
doubt
ill
ever
have
it
again
i
see
where
it
is
coming
from
for
an
irishstyle
dry
stout
and
while
it
is
fairly
tasty
as
a
beverage
and
almost
too
easy
to
drink
just
too
much
like
hot
cocoa
in
my
beer
moreys
bottom
line
a
pretty
good
stout
doesnt
have
that
creaminess
that
i
like
in
a
stout
but
maybe
dry
stouts
arent
supposed
to
would
happily
drink
again
but
probably
wont
search
it
out
enough
bite
but
a
tad
bit
thin
that
in
mind
a
little
dangerous
because
its
exceptionally
drinkable
my
only
suggestion
would
be
for
the
brewmaster
to
add
a
little
more
to
the
body
other
than
that
a
solid
in
some
aspects
outstanding
stout
d
the
lower
abv
gives
a
boost
to
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
nice
overall
flavors
although
muted
lend
to
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
beer
a
nice
look
at
the
style
and
something
you
can
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
bought
a
sixpack
at
the
local
beer
store
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
thin
tan
colored
dense
head
the
nose
is
almost
completely
coffee
with
some
molasses
and
malty
notes
the
beer
has
inital
flavors
of
bitter
coffee
with
a
sweet
undertone
of
malt
based
tastes
there
was
a
smooth
round
full
feel
to
the
beer
in
mouth
and
the
flavors
blend
into
a
decent
light
crisp
finish
its
more
dry
than
a
cream
or
milk
stout
but
not
as
dry
as
an
oatmeal
of
most
dry
stouts
the
aftertaste
is
all
coffee
but
actually
without
the
bitter
the
easy
aftertaste
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
all
night
long
poured
dark
brown
with
a
medium
almond
head
that
disappeared
quickly
smell
is
dominated
by
molasses
tastewise
there
are
some
citrus
notes
some
coffee
and
sweet
molasses
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
eeked
out
and
it
was
a
bit
chalky
and
dry
at
the
finish
decent
lacing
halfway
done
easy
to
drink
but
just
average
flavor
for
this
category
too
many
other
good
ones
out
there
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
d
fairly
high
but
dark
roasted
coffee
tastefinish
may
not
be
for
everyone
not
terribly
warming
and
alcohol
is
low
enough
and
hidden
to
enjoy
a
few
if
its
your
cup
of
coffee
had
this
on
tap
at
toronado
in
san
francisco
pours
an
opaque
black
colour
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
and
good
head
retention
smells
like
both
chocolate
and
coffee
with
the
roasted
malt
this
is
what
an
irish
dry
stout
should
smell
like
nice
sweetness
level
with
faint
bitterness
of
the
roast
smooth
mouthfeel
very
enjoyable
stout
a
fair
amount
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
to
this
one
sturdy
chewy
not
overly
alcoholic
as
if
it
made
you
think
in
the
nose
does
have
a
hop
and
slight
bitter
presence
the
carbonation
delivers
the
beer
just
right
nothing
over
the
top
dry
enough
chewy
enough
a
damn
good
stout
at
a
very
decent
price
no
controversy
surrounding
the
number
here
jack
it
pours
into
a
guinnessesque
cascade
which
settles
out
into
a
sleek
blackbrown
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
light
tan
foam
quite
lovely
i
should
say
the
nose
is
somewhat
weak
comprising
light
roasted
malts
very
light
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
the
taste
does
not
deviate
too
far
from
this
holding
notes
of
mild
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
a
touch
of
espresso
and
a
vague
feeling
of
gingerbread
at
the
finish
the
nitro
allows
everything
to
coalesce
and
slide
about
in
an
unassuming
manner
the
body
is
a
sleek
medium
with
a
light
and
comforting
nitrogenation
and
a
consequently
ridiculously
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
little
irish
stout
were
this
always
on
nitro
id
have
a
solid
goto
when
all
other
taps
fail
excellent
beer
and
i
can
see
why
it
was
chosen
by
my
local
cafe
as
it
is
pretty
much
the
beer
version
of
their
coffee
full
bodied
flavor
and
feel
of
a
smoky
and
toasty
toffee
dark
almond
and
roasted
barley
the
stout
is
very
close
to
style
almost
lacking
in
uniqueness
but
reveling
in
goodness
the
roasted
notes
are
very
smooth
on
the
finish
lacking
in
any
particular
astringents
or
unpleasant
residuals
d
fairly
drinkable
beer
is
quite
strong
for
such
a
low
abv
stout
pint
glass
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
dark
dark
brown
ale
with
a
nice
beige
colored
head
that
quickly
develops
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
roasted
malty
aroma
with
some
chocolate
hints
smokey
taste
with
some
roasted
malts
in
there
there
is
a
somewhat
harshspicy
swallow
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
very
thin
mouthfeel
totally
unexpected
it
looks
hearty
and
smells
good
but
much
too
watery
for
me
not
very
drinkable
for
myself
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
and
try
to
like
it
but
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
love
the
brewery
just
not
this
beer
d
wow
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
smoothest
dry
roasted
stouts
i
have
ever
drank
in
so
that
i
would
only
be
able
to
finish
one
or
two
a
sitting
regardless
i
will
have
to
track
down
more
beers
from
the
north
coast
brewing
co
since
i
only
had
a
couple
and
they
are
amazing
drinkability
this
is
a
very
sound
and
agreeable
stout
perfect
for
those
cold
winter
nights
its
a
session
beer
for
me
i
would
love
to
pick
this
up
again
i
want
another
one
goes
down
easy
and
is
not
overly
filling
a
very
very
very
nice
beer
cheers
drinkability
is
always
as
good
as
the
taste
and
this
beer
taste
was
such
a
let
down
notes
a
very
easy
drinking
dry
stout
not
as
acidic
acrid
and
burnt
as
many
examples
of
the
style
tend
to
be
stays
very
sweet
until
the
finish
a
solid
reliable
beer
and
a
good
start
for
those
who
want
to
venture
further
than
guinness
within
the
style
12oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
which
is
disappointing
since
i
got
this
from
a
beer
store
that
notoriously
has
beer
that
sits
around
for
awhile
on
the
shelf
so
im
guessing
this
may
have
some
age
on
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
chocolate
caramel
and
alcohol
flavors
of
caramel
chocolate
and
an
overall
nice
sweetness
to
it
nowhere
near
as
boozey
as
it
smelled
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
and
worth
a
second
look
a
bit
thin
but
a
nice
sweet
brew
this
is
truly
the
simplist
version
of
the
style
the
reason
it
doesnt
rate
too
high
for
me
is
that
it
doesnt
stand
out
it
is
good
but
not
exceptional
tasty
but
it
doesnt
stand
alone
very
sessionable
i
enjoyed
this
the
whole
time
and
was
sad
to
see
it
go
d
i
could
enjoy
23
with
some
grub
on
a
cool
day
but
for
me
that
would
probably
do
i
really
liked
that
it
wasnt
overly
sweet
and
the
flavors
where
simple
and
very
chocolaty
overall
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
this
one
up
again
sometime
and
i
think
its
worth
a
try
for
sure
cheers
this
is
a
good
beer
but
by
no
means
a
beer
there
would
be
any
sort
of
hype
for
which
is
to
say
its
decent
but
there
isnt
any
originality
or
wowfactor
a
decent
dry
stout
would
be
my
response
if
someone
would
happen
to
ask
what
i
thought
of
it
a
proper
irish
dry
stout
easily
blowing
away
the
sour
brown
water
that
passes
for
draft
guinness
in
the
usa
a
touch
heavier
than
the
big
three
idss
but
more
satisfying
to
drink
pours
a
near
black
finger
of
light
khaki
head
fading
to
a
real
thin
layer
and
a
bit
of
a
collar
some
dark
ruby
red
around
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
minimal
lace
loads
of
malted
barley
and
milk
chocolate
in
the
nose
maybe
some
molasses
and
licorice
here
too
nice
and
sweet
smelling
tastes
mostly
of
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
coffee
smooth
and
a
bit
watery
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
only
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
but
this
goes
down
quick
a
nice
drinker
and
a
nice
dry
stout
overall
decent
stout
for
those
who
may
be
entering
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
or
who
want
something
thats
easy
drinking
i
certainly
cant
fault
it
for
what
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
light
d
very
good
and
will
definitely
revisit
very
nice
dry
stout
had
all
the
elements
of
a
milk
stout
but
not
quite
as
sweet
which
is
actually
quite
nice
will
seek
again
d
a
very
tasty
brew
if
it
was
between
this
or
guinness
i
would
drink
this
hands
down
any
day
of
the
week
an
easy
drinker
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
nitro
think
that
would
add
a
creaminess
to
the
brew
that
would
make
it
phenomenal
its
easy
to
drink
as
its
not
very
rich
you
could
put
a
few
down
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
great
stout
there
are
other
better
picks
dthis
was
better
than
i
expected
i
favor
the
american
and
heavier
foreignexport
and
russian
imperial
stout
styles
this
is
the
best
irish
dry
stout
i
have
had
and
will
definitely
enjoy
this
again
d
low
abv
for
a
stout
makes
it
quite
drinkable
d
surprisingly
sessionable
totally
satisfying
dvery
drinkable
especially
at
this
abv
d
it
would
be
hard
not
to
like
this
stout
it
has
everything
that
a
basic
stout
should
have
great
body
flavor
and
aroma
for
an
everyday
stout
this
is
perfect
drinkability
very
flavorful
for
simple
ingredients
nice
example
of
the
style
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
single
bottle
purchased
at
the
liquor
store
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
extremely
dark
brown
color
huge
offwhite
head
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
a
near
perfect
looking
stout
smell
was
like
chocolate
powder
taste
was
quite
flavorful
dark
coffee
flavors
and
hints
of
cocoa
mouthfeel
was
not
as
good
as
i
would
have
wished
for
for
an
irish
styled
stout
it
was
on
the
thin
side
if
it
was
brewed
with
more
body
it
would
kick
ass
drinkability
was
high
as
it
was
smooth
flavorful
and
has
a
moderate
abv
a
somewhat
run
of
the
mill
stout
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
old
38
overall
a
pretty
solid
stout
overall
the
irish
dry
stout
category
suits
it
well
this
is
a
good
beer
to
seek
out
if
you
want
the
roasted
flavors
of
a
dark
beer
but
without
the
heavier
body
associated
wmany
stouts
and
porters
pretty
approachable
drinkable
and
true
to
style
maybe
the
low
score
is
just
a
sign
that
irish
stouts
arent
my
thing
but
im
still
trying
to
judge
to
style
d
nothing
bad
about
it
but
so
mild
that
i
do
nor
think
that
it
os
worth
it
d
average
abv
low
carbonation
rich
flavor
make
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
hard
not
to
go
back
for
another
sip
will
definitely
get
more
of
this
i
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
but
it
is
creamy
and
feels
refreshing
and
crisp
going
down
quite
drinkable
for
a
dark
beer
d
for
a
smokey
stout
this
one
is
rather
good
d
quite
drinkable
though
not
particularly
memorable
as
the
flavors
are
a
little
on
the
weak
side
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
good
for
what
it
is
d
not
bad
favourite
of
the
style
so
far
but
far
from
a
likable
stout
for
what
it
is
its
good
a
surprisingly
good
stout
from
a
great
brewery
id
argue
that
this
should
be
rated
a
lot
higher
than
it
is
based
on
drinkability
alone
a
fine
example
of
the
style
beer
pours
black
not
very
dark
i
get
some
reddish
notes
on
the
edge
nice
brown
head
very
thick
but
disappear
quickly
thin
film
stays
however
the
aroma
is
intense
for
a
dry
stout
i
get
some
licorice
and
some
chocolate
not
much
coffee
notes
in
the
taste
still
it
is
chocolaty
with
an
espresso
bitterness
at
the
end
the
taste
lingers
in
the
mouth
a
little
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
nice
aroma
of
coffee
sweet
chocolate
and
roasty
malts
moderate
carbonation
and
a
surprisingly
light
and
dry
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
very
dry
flavor
as
well
with
just
a
hint
of
smoke
toast
and
coffee
the
chocolate
from
the
initial
aroma
doesnt
really
come
into
play
although
the
flavor
becomes
more
pleasantly
creamy
as
the
beer
warms
fairly
quick
watery
finish
with
a
malty
emphasis
easy
to
drink
but
it
didnt
really
leave
much
of
an
impression
this
is
a
decent
beer
could
use
more
of
everything
dark
brown
opaque
body
no
visible
carbonation
dark
tannish
rising
brown
head
ala
guiness
rocky
slow
dissipation
with
significant
lacing
the
first
smell
was
heavily
of
coffee
but
nose
became
more
nuanced
as
the
beer
warmed
some
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
coffee
forward
taste
which
once
again
gained
in
complexity
as
the
beer
warmed
some
chocolate
sweetish
malts
and
grassy
hops
not
bitter
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
was
pretty
oily
and
full
drinikability
wihile
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
particular
style
was
pretty
good
worth
a
try
certainly
worth
doing
a
side
by
side
comparision
with
the
big
three
d
well
balanced
smooth
and
light
bodied
stout
not
a
sipping
beer
you
can
have
a
couple
of
these
easily
id
much
prefer
this
beer
than
some
of
the
irish
counterparts
like
guinness
or
beamish
nice
roasted
malt
nose
with
a
fair
amount
of
chocolate
and
some
roasted
coffee
bean
notes
smell
reminds
me
of
some
bigger
stouts
lighter
in
flavor
than
the
nose
and
pour
might
suggest
and
offers
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
with
a
somewhat
thin
body
some
texture
returns
on
the
finish
then
the
dry
roasted
character
returns
and
lingers
moderately
along
with
some
chocolatey
spice
quite
dry
overall
with
a
bit
too
much
of
overly
roasted
coffee
underpinning
the
taste
and
feel
for
me
though
decent
nonetheless
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
some
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
its
sweeter
than
i
expected
mouthfeelbody
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
coating
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
starts
with
a
surprisingly
light
mouthfeel
especially
for
a
beer
this
rich
clean
up
front
gives
way
to
roasty
flavors
of
black
patent
malt
and
some
bitter
chocolate
persistent
lacing
from
a
thick
tan
head
aroma
kinda
unspectacular
just
a
pleasant
malt
character
faint
starts
gently
finishes
strong
i
may
have
another
d
a
very
nice
sessionable
stout
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
flavorful
it
is
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
mthis
is
a
very
tasty
stout
big
bold
flavors
and
enough
of
a
body
to
let
you
know
its
a
stout
nice
array
of
flavors
nothing
crazy
but
a
very
good
irish
stout
d
this
is
an
excellent
stout
the
flavors
are
so
big
that
i
was
shocked
to
later
learn
how
low
the
alcohol
is
great
complexity
in
the
flavor
nothing
stands
out
too
powerfully
and
everything
comes
together
quite
nicely
attractive
looking
stout
poured
into
goblet
from
near
room
temperature
bottle
head
is
monumental
and
rocky
nearly
as
full
as
the
steam
billowing
from
the
locomotive
pictured
on
the
bottle
beer
itself
is
near
jet
black
head
retains
quite
well
and
laces
wonderfully
definitive
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
along
with
some
dark
ripe
fruits
coffee
and
a
hint
of
hop
character
big
roasted
coffee
flavors
up
front
also
malty
sweet
with
fruit
and
some
subtle
hops
has
a
tangy
slightly
sour
sweetness
on
the
nottoobitter
finish
that
is
just
a
bit
dry
love
the
mouthfeel
full
creamy
and
good
carbonation
level
overall
a
very
nice
drinking
experience
and
a
top
notch
stout
brew
poured
to
a
nice
deep
brown
color
guess
more
on
the
black
side
with
a
nice
frothy
small
light
tan
head
that
broke
down
pretty
quickly
fair
amount
of
lacing
though
aroma
has
roasted
malts
chocolate
with
a
nice
sweet
aroma
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
bad
either
the
flavor
seems
to
have
more
of
a
burnt
malt
flavor
which
came
across
as
roasted
in
the
nose
the
astringency
of
it
is
nice
and
seems
to
help
the
hop
bitterness
after
subsequent
the
chocolate
and
coffee
comes
out
both
of
these
seem
to
make
the
beer
feel
a
little
sweet
on
the
tongue
hope
presence
is
there
and
adds
a
nice
finish
which
you
dont
get
on
most
dry
stouts
does
have
a
dry
finish
in
the
mouth
slightly
watery
feel
but
from
my
past
experiences
with
dry
stouts
they
all
seem
this
was
so
i
am
thinking
that
this
might
be
expected
d
nearly
parallel
to
guinness
both
of
them
are
virtually
interchangeable
a
novice
beer
drinker
who
didnt
want
to
drink
a
brew
that
is
too
bitter
or
too
sweet
probably
should
give
these
kind
of
stouts
a
try
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
always
enjoy
trying
brews
ive
never
had
before
no
matter
what
the
style
or
brand
overall
i
just
plain
dont
like
this
style
ive
decided
watered
down
stout
is
all
i
can
think
of
but
i
think
they
did
an
alright
job
of
doing
what
they
were
aiming
for
nothing
special
though
d
drinkability
is
average
at
best
drinkability
is
nice
not
sure
this
fits
in
the
irish
dry
style
seems
to
be
more
of
an
american
stout
definitely
errs
of
the
session
side
though
light
in
alcohol
and
not
overpowering
in
flavors
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
all
in
all
a
nice
drinkable
stout
d
a
very
solid
stout
could
drink
a
couple
the
body
and
drinkability
were
both
at
the
upper
end
of
the
spectrum
for
this
type
of
brew
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
worth
your
time
to
try
try
one
the
body
was
a
little
shy
of
full
the
feel
was
fluffy
with
an
initial
sharpness
from
the
carbonation
its
a
good
beer
but
its
not
as
memorable
as
i
was
hoping
over
this
beer
is
okay
it
reminds
me
of
a
better
version
of
guinness
which
in
my
opinion
is
both
good
and
bad
good
because
its
a
better
version
but
still
bad
because
guinness
just
isnt
that
great
of
a
beer
i
am
surprised
this
beer
does
not
get
even
higher
scores
an
attractive
stout
with
a
dark
brown
color
that
appears
black
in
the
glass
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
just
light
lacing
though
really
surprised
by
the
aroma
i
am
a
sucker
for
english
hops
and
this
stout
seems
to
be
stuffed
with
them
awesome
floral
and
herbal
aromas
that
compliment
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
hops
come
into
play
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
beginning
is
hop
flavors
followed
by
the
customary
roasted
malt
that
gives
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
not
being
on
nitro
or
casked
it
cannot
compete
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
this
beer
still
has
a
nice
body
and
carbonation
nice
flavor
and
low
abv
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
md
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
but
but
it
isnt
thin
or
watery
feeling
like
guinness
i
would
call
this
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
i
would
reach
for
in
an
instant
when
i
was
looking
for
dark
but
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
drinks
fairly
well
here
very
much
to
style
on
the
irish
dry
im
glad
i
tried
this
north
coast
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
d
this
is
very
drinkable
and
a
sessionable
stout
i
love
the
roasted
profile
pours
a
deep
opaque
sable
with
a
thick
finebubbled
fairly
persistent
beige
head
aroma
is
strong
smoky
and
oily
with
undertones
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
molasses
and
just
a
whiff
of
coffee
smoky
flavor
has
a
woody
undertone
as
well
as
firm
tones
of
molasses
and
mocha
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
tingly
leaving
a
satisfying
and
slightly
gritty
finish
d
let
this
one
sit
in
the
glass
for
a
bit
especially
if
its
been
in
a
cold
fridge
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
for
a
middleweight
irish
stout
and
this
one
might
even
make
a
nice
session
stout
its
been
a
favorite
of
mine
for
a
while
now
finally
getting
around
to
a
review
it
may
not
pair
up
with
mussels
or
scallops
as
well
as
guinness
does
but
id
have
it
with
seafood
in
a
jiffy
also
good
mexican
mole
dishes
or
lamb
stew
or
vanilla
ice
cream
dessert
d
i
need
more
of
these
in
my
fridge
a
good
go
to
beer
for
folks
to
try
new
styles
without
breakin
the
bank
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
more
frequently
than
others
it
seems
to
be
missing
a
little
something
but
that
may
be
me
getting
used
to
imperial
stouts
otherwise
this
beer
is
a
nice
beer
experience
it
has
a
nice
even
medium
body
and
feels
great
going
down
it
dies
have
a
slight
aftertaste
but
only
the
briefest
good
mouthfeel
and
drinks
well
overall
a
decent
stout
all
told
this
was
really
a
good
stout
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
its
definitely
a
solid
stout
that
i
could
drink
at
least
two
of
in
a
night
not
a
flavor
bouquet
but
its
still
tasty
pretty
good
showing
from
north
coast
hard
pour
into
a
sn
hop
tulip
glass
pours
a
deep
mahogany
3
finger
head
with
a
smidge
of
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
slight
chocolate
bitterness
in
the
taste
as
well
as
malt
not
at
all
sweet
but
well
balanced
a
good
example
of
what
i
consider
to
be
a
classic
stout
j
kac
drinkability
is
high
as
this
beer
goes
down
easy
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
as
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
ive
had
pitch
black
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
creamy
head
aroma
is
chocolate
taste
is
smoked
maltscoffee
and
cocoa
smooth
and
creamy
goes
down
like
silk
like
most
stouts
very
enjoyable
and
flavorful
i
highly
recommend
and
would
gladly
purchase
again
d
i
could
put
back
a
few
and
love
it
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
session
or
drink
all
night
a
very
fine
stout
offering
that
is
delicious
without
being
overly
full
bodied
could
be
a
sessionable
stout
candidate
drinkability
is
good
in
the
sense
that
this
beer
goes
down
relatively
easily
but
i
dont
necessarily
feel
like
i
really
want
another
its
good
but
a
single
was
plenty
for
now
perhaps
ill
return
to
this
one
sometime
in
the
future
all
in
all
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
north
coast
one
of
my
favs
it
didnt
strike
me
as
an
irish
dry
stout
but
none
the
less
it
was
a
good
beer
a
good
stout
d
not
sure
if
i
can
take
in
too
many
of
these
at
one
sitting
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
moderate
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
collar
the
aroma
wasnt
much
a
little
bit
of
sweet
coffee
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
sweet
coffee
not
a
lot
there
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
overall
this
was
actually
good
for
an
irish
dry
stout
which
usually
dont
amount
to
much
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
too
thin
has
a
opaque
dark
color
with
a
firm
dark
cream
head
that
lingers
for
the
whole
drink
aroma
was
a
mix
of
roasted
malts
and
some
cocoa
taste
had
the
cocoa
and
malts
but
also
a
coffee
flavor
to
it
beer
had
a
good
creamy
thickness
to
it
and
the
firm
head
helped
that
overall
a
decent
stout
right
on
par
with
guinness
conclusion
great
aromas
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
simplistic
and
one
dimensional
still
a
tasty
irish
dry
stout
notes
when
you
consider
that
you
could
simply
get
old
rasputin
same
brewery
of
course
a
superior
masterful
beer
then
this
is
certainly
second
tier
from
north
coast
that
being
said
this
is
a
fine
stout
d
i
think
that
one
is
enough
for
me
nice
and
smokey
but
is
missing
the
elegance
that
others
have
taste
is
smooth
and
dry
dark
and
milk
chocolate
some
vanilla
some
roasted
nuts
malt
and
some
strong
on
the
coffee
and
ends
dry
and
a
little
bitter
d
light
body
and
abv
make
this
one
a
good
session
beer
tasty
too
no
old
rasputin
though
another
good
beer
from
north
coast
it
is
not
my
favorite
from
them
but
still
very
enjoyable

12
oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
aroma
of
super
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
and
some
raisins
flavor
of
roasted
sweet
malt
with
some
vegetal
notes
this
was
not
very
interesting
it
was
sweet
and
meh
medium
bodied
and
creamy
more
round
on
the
palate
than
id
expect
but
with
a
good
dose
of
biting
roastiness
on
the
tail
end
astringent
maybe
pretty
good
carbonation
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
creaminess
drinkable
enough
though
its
starting
to
feel
a
little
heavy
d
good
enough
to
get
again
and
it
is
light
in
alcohol
so
this
passes
the
drinkability
test
for
me
i
finished
my
12oz
in
no
time
for
some
reason
i
found
this
in
a
dingy
liquor
store
and
i
dont
see
this
paticular
beer
carried
in
a
lot
of
places
i
wonder
why
drinkability
ill
be
picking
it
up
again
and
see
it
as
a
good
drink
by
yourself
beer
not
sure
if
it
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
i
prefer
my
stout
a
bit
more
flavorful
then
this
one
im
glad
i
got
to
try
one
again
for
sentimental
reasons
the
taste
is
not
as
intense
as
the
aromas
a
bit
mellower
a
lot
of
light
roasted
malty
flavors
a
sip
yields
slightly
bitter
coffee
flavors
with
a
little
figs
and
spiciness
to
provide
a
nice
refinement
reminds
me
of
a
good
refreshing
baltic
porter
again
the
flavors
dont
match
the
intensity
of
the
overall
aroma
which
is
stellar
but
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
beer
with
a
full
mouthfeel
and
high
drinkability
that
i
enjoyed
even
more
upon
a
second
helping
poured
into
a
mug
as
a
completely
pitch
black
beer
with
plenty
of
thick
tan
head
head
slowly
evaporated
leaving
lacing
down
the
glass
taste
is
smooth
with
some
brief
chocolaty
hints
not
very
strong
and
doesnt
last
very
long
either
overall
i
was
very
underwhelmed
by
the
averageness
of
this
beer
drinkable
but
unremarkable
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
nothing
like
the
thick
creaminess
i
expect
from
the
style
a
little
fizzy
but
that
dies
in
about
half
a
second
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
brown
ale
or
a
weak
porter
than
a
stout
im
sad
to
say
i
find
it
lackluster
north
coast
has
never
disappointed
me
before
but
there
is
just
so
much
more
to
be
expected
from
the
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
of
the
irish
stouts
ive
had
this
beer
is
the
last
opaque
as
i
could
see
through
it
when
held
to
light
it
has
a
small
tan
colored
head
the
smell
appears
to
be
great
and
strong
for
the
style
i
can
pick
up
milk
chocolate
with
some
coffee
as
well
the
taste
was
almost
repulsive
initially
there
was
a
strong
roasted
flavor
up
front
and
before
the
taste
could
settle
in
the
dry
bitterness
set
in
im
not
sure
what
hops
were
used
but
it
left
for
a
bad
aftertaste
this
one
was
close
to
a
drain
pour
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
good
carbonation
yet
a
bit
weak
on
thickness
due
to
the
bad
taste
i
cannot
rate
this
beer
high
on
drinkability
even
with
its
low
abv
im
using
this
beer
as
a
later
drink
in
my
evenings
to
finish
off
this
six
pack
finish
is
smooth
and
resiny
delicious
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
two
shades
shy
of
black
with
a
quarter
inch
tancolored
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
soapy
slick
of
foam
minimal
lacing
with
weak
legs
nose
suggests
chocolate
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
and
lactic
acid
strange
taste
definitely
chocolate
malt
but
a
strange
peppery
quality
also
a
bit
of
char
somewhere
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
with
a
consistent
background
effervescence
drinkability
is
decent
just
not
overly
digging
the
pepperycharred
character
in
the
flavor
profile
nice
enough
going
down
decent
stout
worth
the
purchase
though
nothing
remarkable
for
a
dry
stout
it
has
fairly
good
rich
flavour
and
body
overall
its
wellrounded
and
the
balance
is
good
but
the
bitter
chocolatecoffee
element
seems
just
a
little
too
strong
d
while
drinkable
i
feel
the
roastedburnt
flavor
was
little
too
much
12oz
poured
fairly
thick
and
was
nearblack
in
color
tan
head
was
fluffy
and
not
quick
to
dissipate
initial
aroma
was
a
waft
of
sweet
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
pleasant
to
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
decent
with
an
apparent
dryness
which
was
acceptable
for
the
style
flavors
were
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
with
a
balanced
hop
character
the
finish
seemed
to
be
more
bitter
chocolate
rather
than
bitter
hops
which
again
was
very
pleasant
overall
a
great
interpretation
of
a
dry
stout
obviously
different
than
an
average
guinness
but
very
enjoyable
the
beer
looks
great
it
has
a
pitch
black
tone
with
an
enormous
tan
head
i
dont
pick
up
a
whole
lot
in
the
nose
it
definitely
has
some
roastyness
but
it
is
a
little
lacking
i
am
really
digging
the
flavor
of
this
beer
it
seems
like
it
sticks
to
the
style
very
well
with
its
roasty
flavor
it
is
full
of
flavor
with
a
light
type
of
body
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
okay
i
am
golfing
yesterday
come
into
the
clubhouse
bar
to
grab
a
beer
for
the
back
9
obviously
water
was
apart
of
the
equation
also
but
anyways
im
looking
for
something
tasty
i
see
a
green
covered
brown
bottle
next
to
a
heineken
its
called
old38
they
say
its
a
stout
so
i
was
all
for
it
little
did
i
know
this
was
a
north
coast
brew
but
i
was
excited
to
have
a
stout
on
this
windy
day
of
golf
it
kept
me
warm
mouth
feel
is
dry
smooth
tinge
of
alcohol
and
some
burnt
taste
of
something
smell
was
like
coffee
and
chocolate
appearance
was
nice
foam
proceeded
to
pour
over
my
styrofoam
issued
course
cup
after
they
poured
the
brew
for
me
which
was
a
little
dismaying
since
i
obviously
wanted
to
drink
what
i
paid
for
so
the
head
was
thick
and
visually
the
brew
looked
like
a
guinness
it
is
dry
like
a
guinness
with
more
carbonation
and
just
about
the
same
foam
content
i
was
still
able
to
enjoy
the
most
o
this
beer
and
am
looking
forward
to
getting
a
six
pack
or
an
absurdly
priced
4pack
i
have
had
the
6
pack
twice
now
they
did
not
disappoint
good
stuff
north
coast
keep
up
the
good
work
nose
of
roasted
malt
and
quite
a
bit
of
cocoa
roasted
tones
dominate
upon
tasting
taste
is
dry
right
off
roasted
coffee
mouthfeel
is
rather
than
and
dry
ap
retty
good
example
of
the
style
nut
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
poured
cold
from
the
bottle
the
color
is
a
ruby
tinged
burnt
dark
brown
almost
opaque
the
head
is
a
scant
swirl
of
light
brown
with
fair
lacing
evidenced
the
aroma
is
a
sharp
merlot
and
chocolate
coffee
the
flavor
brings
a
deep
chocolate
bread
pudding
sweetness
with
a
little
smokey
citrusy
bite
i
pick
up
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
rye
within
an
effervescent
but
quite
drinkable
tastey
stout
somewhat
of
a
porter
perhaps
although
as
either
style
this
one
is
a
wonderful
treat
which
could
easily
be
sessioned
well
done
north
coast
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
for
a
dry
irish
stout
underrated
for
its
style
for
sure
easy
to
drink
in
the
sense
of
a
light
body
and
mild
flavor
but
its
not
begging
me
to
get
another
bottle
balance
can
describe
this
stout
well
not
too
roasty
hoppy
or
carbonated
just
right
amounts
of
each
make
for
a
very
approachable
and
tasty
dry
stout
it
is
a
bit
thin
and
mild
but
that
is
not
always
a
bad
thing
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
and
the
chocolate
becomes
more
evident
upon
warming
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
quite
the
sessionable
stout
there
is
always
room
for
this
in
my
fridge
good
irish
dry
the
roasted
flavors
and
coffee
flavors
are
not
overbearing
at
all
which
makes
this
beer
very
smooth
all
the
way
through
and
very
drinkable
i
would
have
liked
more
head
and
lacing
due
to
the
style
but
taste
wise
this
is
a
great
beer
d
an
enjoyable
stout
a
little
different
but
worth
a
try
dry
aftertaste
each
sip
teases
me
workin
up
my
appetite
sky
rockets
in
flight
afternoon
delight
overall
a
decent
beer
im
just
not
a
fan
dotson
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
opaque
and
black
however
when
held
to
the
light
very
faint
ruby
hues
show
on
the
edges
there
is
a
slight
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
film
slight
lacing
that
quickly
fades
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
nose
is
of
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
of
roasted
and
sweet
malts
chocolate
with
a
deeper
coffee
finish
there
is
slight
hop
bite
blended
in
just
enough
to
give
a
kick
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
creamy
mouthfeel
not
too
filling
this
is
a
nice
stout
mild
foam
for
a
head
but
sits
there
like
its
waiting
for
a
late
bus
patient
but
ready
to
go
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
black

the
very
outer

carefully
toasted
nose
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
bean
chocolate
coated

comes
at
you
slowly
with
its
hands
out
in
friendliness
the
hops
lack
a
distinct
scent
profile
but
do
firm
up
and
sharpen
the
dominant
malts
lasts
well
but
tactfully
in
keeping
with
general
demeanor
mediumbodied
probably
fuller
but
it
is
sufficiently
dry
that
its
hard
for
the
palate
to
fully
register
whats
soaking
in
again
no
lack
of
black
chocolate
coffee

slight
increase
in
oatmeal
cereal
graininess
carbonation
noticeable
when
you
want
to
notice
it
that
is
appropriate
level
drying
finish
brings
out
shades
of
tea
leaf
lemon
peel
and
poor
brown
earth
hits
the
right
notes
but
not
gonna
sing
the
aria
old
38
is
an
almost
black
ale
with
a
reddish
tint
and
a
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
tight
film
it
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
and
stays
the
whole
way
down
it
has
a
roasted
aroma
thats
sweet
and
a
touch
tart
there
are
notes
of
coffee
licorice
and
brown
sugar
it
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
incredibly
smooth
it
feels
a
bit
fluffy
in
the
mouth
the
finish
is
dry
and
dusty
the
flavor
is
very
roasted
almost
smokey
with
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
its
a
touch
sweet
and
syrupy
but
perfectly
balanced
i
think
this
may
be
the
stout
on
which
i
originally
developed
my
palate
the
malt
and
hops
just
work
together
on
a
new
plane
of
beer
existence
i
could
drink
a
bucket
of
this
this
is
like
a
beer
custom
made
for
me
d
i
love
stouts
but
im
still
not
a
fan
of
irish
dry
stouts
black
little
head
to
speak
of
smells
of
a
bit
of
coffee
flavors
are
kind
of
everywhere
not
to
well
balanced
to
my
pallet
dry
obviously
but
also
roasted
malts
and
bitter
finish
i
like
all
the
flavors
individually
but
together
they
just
arent
working
properly
in
this
one
not
a
drain
pour
just
not
something
i
will
be
having
again
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
a
nice
irish
dry
stout
does
not
bog
you
down
by
being
too
heavy
could
easily
have
a
few
in
a
night
drinkability
would
try
again
but
wont
be
seeking
out
anytime
soon
overall
im
a
big
north
coast
fan
and
was
very
happy
with
this
brew
try
the
old
rasputin
which
will
also
not
disappoint
a
bit
lighter
than
most
stouts
holding
it
up
to
the
light
you
can
see
to
the
other
side
the
nose
is
pretty
weak
i
honestly
cant
smell
much
of
anything
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
sweet
chocolate
sweeter
than
most
and
toffee
finish
is
pleasantly
dry
not
great
not
bad
id
honestly
have
expected
better
from
this
brewery
though
d
wish
i
had
a
nice
shepherds
pie
or
beef
stew
to
pair
this
with
still
its
fine
as
a
standalone
end
to
the
evening
likeable
easy
to
drink
just
a
bit
high
in
alcohol
to
be
truly
sessionable
worth
a
try
a
stout
id
have
again
drinkability
just
right
for
a
few
to
go
down
well
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
had
drinkability
easy
to
drink
stout
that
is
strong
on
the
roasted
tones
with
a
bitter
profile
a
few
of
these
can
be
had
in
a
session
a
very
smooth
irish
dry
stout
on
the
top
of
that
i
have
tried
id
recommend
this
over
guinness
draught
unless
you
really
want
the
nitro
feel
a
little
higher
on
the
abv
side
still
maybe
sessionable
recommended
pours
out
a
dark
brown
not
quite
black
a
2cm
head
sits
on
top
with
loose
clumps
of
bubbles
a
little
lacing
and
alright
retention
the
smell
is
the
nicest
part
some
sweetness
with
a
roasted
back
a
very
nice
smell
for
a
dry
irish
stout
the
taste
is
kind
of
bitter
but
without
the
pleasant
coffee
taste
id
expect
to
accompany
there
isnt
as
much
sweetness
or
creaminess
as
id
expect
from
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
prickly
and
lacks
the
smoothness
id
expect
from
other
examples
of
the
style
it
actually
drinks
fairly
well
and
gets
much
better
as
it
warms
12oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
an
almost
opaque
black
with
a
thin
offwhite
diminishing
head
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
fresh
ground
coffee
roasted
malts
and
powdered
cocoa
the
taste
is
all
the
roasted
malts
id
expect
from
a
stout
with
traces
of
espresso
and
lingering
bitter
cocoa
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
textbook
stout
to
say
the
least
d
cant
really
go
back
for
more
my
buddy
is
on
a
quest
to
get
me
to
like
dry
irish
stouts
but
its
not
looking
good
edit
i
did
give
the
other
5
away
and
got
very
positive
comments
i
have
since
realized
that
this
bottle
was
oxidized
and
i
am
going
to
buy
another
one
and
rereview
it
recommend
yes
will
be
trying
other
ncbc
beers
now
too
a
good
stout
by
a
great
brewery
i
probably
wont
by
this
again
for
a
while
but
have
no
regrets
about
the
6
pack
this
is
beer
is
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
it
makes
for
a
very
flavorful
and
accessible
session
beer
pours
an
almost
pitch
black
colored
body
with
a
humongous
foamy
tan
head
very
vigorous
and
very
lasting
very
chocolaty
aroma
a
little
musty
some
roasted
coffee
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
creamy
smelling
aroma
too
creamy
ashy
bitter
chocolate
taste
light
fizziness
not
as
sweet
a
taste
as
in
the
aroma
nice
taste
not
too
heavy
or
alcoholy
hv
deep
brown
ale
with
little
if
any
red
hues
topped
by
thick
beige
head
which
stands
long
the
nose
is
filled
by
toffee
melanoidins
sherry
and
burnt
paper
however
the
palate
is
almost
entirely
dominated
by
a
dry
ashy
roasted
grain
flavor
that
takes
on
an
astringent
quality
similar
to
over
steeped
tea
the
beer
as
the
qualities
necessary
for
style
including
relatively
thin
still
and
dry
but
just
to
dry
on
palate
just
an
average
american
version
of
an
irish
dry
stout
d
very
drinkable
stout
with
all
of
the
flavors
blending
well
together
with
a
lower
abv
which
was
nice
why
would
anyone
have
a
guinness
when
they
can
drink
this
beer
great
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
burnt
chocolate
aroma
with
matching
flavor
bittersweet
and
smoky
with
a
good
chunk
of
dark
and
milk
chocolate
thrown
in
for
an
incredible
combination
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
its
very
easy
going
nothing
abrasive
about
this
brew
great
label
to
match
a
very
drinkable
stout
d
drinkability
was
nice
dry
and
silky
good
everyday
beer
d
goes
down
smooth
a
little
heavy
on
the
citrus
for
my
taste
still
very
well
made
and
tasty
could
definitely
drink
a
few
i
dont
see
this
one
real
often
but
when
i
do
its
worth
trying
very
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
too
pours
a
nearly
impenetrable
black
with
the
edges
showing
just
a
touch
of
red
the
light
brown
cap
has
a
strong
will
to
survive
the
duration
of
this
healthy
looking
treat
lots
of
sticky
circular
rope
lacing
coats
my
glassfinishing
off
this
sexy
stout
the
nose
is
sweet
with
what
smells
like
caramel
malts
and
flavored
coffee
milky
way
candy
barschocolate
covered
coffee
beansand
burnt
toast
make
up
the
conglomeration
of
flavors
that
are
mixing
together
with
each
sip
this
is
a
little
sweeter
than
most
stoutsbut
not
too
sweet
dry
and
a
little
watery
on
the
finishi
enjoy
the
drynessbut
the
body
could
use
the
volume
turned
up
two
notches
the
creaminess
could
also
use
a
kick
in
the
azz
very
flavorful
and
quaffable
brew
that
i
will
revisit
anyways
i
poured
this
one
into
a
brandy
snifter
but
a
pint
glass
would
work
great
i
think
this
beer
could
be
drank
at
any
temp
from
45
62
without
a
problem
it
all
depends
on
what
you
prefer
to
taste
more
great
bitter
hop
go
higher
more
sweet
malty
goodness
go
colder
this
was
a
great
almost
find
do
yourself
a
favor
go
get

of
these

flavor
is
very

a

semisweet
chocolate
provides
a
touch
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
the
carbonation
is
too
high
this
style
would
be
better
suited
to
a
light
carbonation
to
enhance
a
creamy
body
nonetheless
this
is
miles
tastier
than
the
standard
irish
stout
fare
like
guinness
and
murphys
pours
a
stong
lively
light
brown
head

recedes
to

some

plenty
of

sessionable
d
on
the
whole
a
solid
beer
but
didnt
wow
me
in
any
big
way
d
drinkable
but
not
great
usually
i
have
high
praise
for
north
coast
beers
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
nice
to
drink
regularly
old
38
is
a
smooth
and
creamy
stout
that
has
some
lovely
dark
flavors
but
no
bigger
ones
a
fact
that
i
dont
mind
one
bit
its
got
a
lot
of
the
big
player
flavors
to
make
it
a
great
stout
but
not
an
overpowering
taste
the
flavors
work
well
with
a
mild
carbonation
and
a
shallow
bitterness
all
adding
up
to
a
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
beer
a
lazy
drinkers
review
to
be
sure
but
old
38
stout
is
nothing
mindblowing
just
another
absolutely
solid
beer
from
north
coast
simple
but
very
drinkable
ill
definitely
pick
this
up
in
the
future
an
ok
stout
without
much
body
and
somewhat
lacking
in
the
taste
department
this
beer
is
dark
but
rather
transparent
for
a
stout
the
smell
is
mostly
roasted
malt
chocolatey
malt
there
is
even
an
interesting
hop
character
in
the
background
the
taste
is
similar
but
the
feel
is
so
light
that
it
kind
of
washes
out
the
beers
potential
i
guess
its
fairly
drinkable
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
choice
for
a
stout
its
not
bad
and
if
you
like
light
stouts
its
probably
a
good
choice
its
just
not
my
thing
drinks
easy
enough
a
nice
stout
that
has
a
bit
too
much
coffee
character
for
me
drinkability
while
the
aftertaste
definitely
reminded
me
of
old
rasputin
my
favorite
beer
i
cant
imagine
myself
sitting
around
and
drinking
these
carbonation
is
too
high
body
is
too
thick
flavor
aint
anything
special
overall
not
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
though
it
could
be
that
the
dry
stout
isnt
my
thing
the
finish
stays
on
the
palate
for
a
while
d
drinkable
yes
but
there
are
much
better
representations
of
the
style
out
there
2
5
d
due
to
the
watery
texture
that
for
me
proved
a
poor
match
to
the
other
characteristics
i
will
not
be
buying
regularly
very
drinkable
stout
even
in
summer
i
used
this
as
a
desert
beer
d
very
drinkable
but
again
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
expect
and
a
bit
bland
good
lacing
though
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
has
some
differences
from
the
usual
stout
flavors
which
is
good
d
very
high
fantastic
stout
old
38
pours
a
dark
brown
color
very
opaque
with
a
moderate
brown
head
a
bit
of
astringency
to
the
nose
adding
to
its
maturity
chocolate
liquor
thick
roasted
malts
and
a
slight
creamy
caramel
aroma
chocolate
and
semisweet
coffee
are
very
big
component
directly
up
front
while
tasting
tiny
bubbles
of
bright
carbonation
adds
a
refreshing
zing
to
the
experience
and
doesnt
ruin
its
creamy
texture
there
is
still
some
hop
bitterness
to
the
finish
and
a
slightly
warming
alcohol
presence
the
drinkability
is
great
this
one
goes
down
very
smooth
its
hard
to
keep
myself
from
going
to
town
on
the
rest
of
these
bottles
but
i
feel
that
with
a
few
more
months
it
will
become
even
tastier
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
not
bad
but
a
bit
bland
a
little
sour
roasty
and
a
faint
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
standout
d
excellent
stout
a
little
to
bitter
for
my
liking
but
a
stout
that
ill
continually
search
out
and
enjoy
smells
like
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
some
semisweet
chocolate
with
nice
hint
of
honey
pours
to
a
pitch
black
that
lets
no
light
through
at
all
nice
tan
head
that
dissappears
quickly
but
clings
to
the
glass
taste
is
nice
and
heavy
with
sweet
chocolate
and
a
tart
but
not
bitter
hoppiness
throughout
finish
is
dry
hence
the
style
and
leaves
one
anticipating
another
sip
mouthfeel
is
spectacular
starts
heavy
and
chewy
and
finishes
silky
smooth
great
style
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
bottoms
up
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
certainly
a
good
example
of
a
dry
stout
i
personally
prefer
to
select
oatmeal
and
imperial
stouts
instead
of
this
one
the
drink
is
fullishmedium
in
body
and
despite
a
gracious
plenty
of
carbonation
to
help
lighten
the
feel
a
residual
stickiness
marks
the
drinks
passing
nicely
drinkable
good
session
beer
glad
i
took
a
gamble
on
this
brew
feel
starts
off
somewhat
watery
and
thin
but
grows
somewhat
on
the
palate
still
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
style
lends
itself
well
to
drinking
a
few
this
isnt
quite
the
best
in
class
but
worth
a
pass
my
only
complaint
is
the
carbonation
level
is
wound
up
too
high
model
it
after
the
flavor
let
it
mellow
drinkability
is
average
i
much
prefer
some
other
irish
stout
options
out
there
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
color
there
is
some
light
showing
through
so
it
is
not
quite
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
up
front
with
a
good
amount
of
roasted
bitterness
and
hops
in
the
very
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
old
38
is
a
good
dry
stout
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
recommended
pours
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
and
modest
lace
smells
like
dry
toasted
bread
with
hints
of
chocolate
malt
and
an
herbal
hop
overlay
the
flavor
is
very
hopforward
for
an
irish
style
strong
pine
hop
notes
up
front
permit
only
a
bit
of
toasted
bread
and
dark
fruit
flavor
to
sneak
through
to
the
center
rather
dry
and
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
not
at
all
creamy
with
carbonation
very
pronounced
not
a
winner
for
me
cheers
md
on
the
thinner
side
well
carbonated
a
drinkable
stout
but
not
a
great
stout
pours
nice
with
foamy
cappucino
colored
head
the
aroma
made
my
knees
weak
roasted
grains
espresso
coffee
tart
hops
hops
and
bitter
chocolate
dominate
the
taste
with
roasted
grains
scattered
nicely
complex
dry
finish
that
had
me
wanting
more
so
i
had
four
more
d
its
lighter
character
sure
up
the
drinkability
for
me
because
after
one
i
dont
feel
like
i
just
ate
lunch
tons
of
flavor
and
moderate
abv
and
the
fact
that
im
not
drinking
roasted
malt
concentrated
syrup
would
make
her
some
around
the
mountain
when
she
comes
for
a
session
that
is
i
had
no
idea
i
was
buying
an
irish
dry
stout
when
i
picked
this
up
i
gave
it
a
bit
of
a
hit
on
mouthfeel
with
an
extra
12
point
for
style
not
creamy
at
all
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
the
head
lasts
a
good
while
and
the
brew
is
very
very
dark
brown
smell
is
roasted
malts
toast
coffee
and
a
bit
of
almond
taste
is
the
same
the
almond
and
cherries
taste
not
as
strong
as
an
almond
stout
all
in
all
a
good
brew
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
brew
from
this
brewery
ill
buy
old
rasputin
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
wondeful
color
and
aroma
decent
tan
head
w
minimal
lacing
very
low
carbonation
smooth
as
silk
definetly
a
good
choive
if
your
looking
for
something
different
ill
need
to
find
other
styyles
from
this
brewery
soon
d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
and
knock
back
a
couple
while
watching
a
game
or
with
dinner
really
enjoy
this
brew
very
good
aroma
mostly
chocolate
and
coffee
which
opens
up
to
a
mostly
dry
medium
bodied
beer
with
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
flavors
not
complex
but
nicely
crafted
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
yeah
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
for
whatever
reason
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
the
second
time
around
still
irish
dry
stouts
and
the
5
abv
malaysiabrewed
version
of
guinness
foreign
extra
are
now
readily
available
in
beijing
if
you
look
for
them
so
hopefully
instead
theyll
start
importing
some
hardertofind
styles
in
the
future
d
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
but
too
viscous
to
pound
quickly
i
liked
this
stout
a
bit
more
than
most
of
the
reviewers
and
so
be
it
it
pours
a
nice
deep
ruby
tawny
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
tannish
head
that
hangs
around
a
long
while
there
is
ample
lacing
to
this
beer
the
smell
is
modest
roasted
malts
chocolaty
maybe
a
hint
of
a
dark
cherry
chocolate
the
beer
is
preeminently
creamy
and
medium
bodied
with
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
a
slightly
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
to
let
you
know
there
are
hops
present
and
plenty
of
chocolately
notes
throughout
the
beer
has
a
slightly
chalky
finish
slightly
drying
but
a
bit
sweet
for
a
dry
stout
this
isnt
the
best
representation
of
a
dry
stout
in
fact
its
pretty
wide
of
the
mark
i
like
the
beer
as
is
regardless
of
label
or
type
this
is
a
smooth
creamy
easy
to
drink
stout
that
i
really
enjoyed
lchaim
the
beer
is
a
has
a
good
and
heavy
mouthfeel
but
coming
in
at
just
under
6
abv
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
more
drinkablility
is
good
this
is
a
decent
irish
dry
though
there
is
much
better
out
there
wonderfully
drinkable
great
flavor
not
as
heavy
as
some
stouts
a
nice
abv
for
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
very
good
example
of
the
style
probably
my
favorite
irish
dry
ive
had
so
far
and
high
up
in
all
the
stouts
ive
had
d
all
in
all
a
great
beer
i
could
enjoy
several
pints
a
night
this
beer
poured
a
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
twofinger
dark
tan
head
the
smell
is
toasted
malts
with
some
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
semisweet
chocolate
tasting
malt
that
gives
way
to
some
slight
coffee
tastes
that
are
cut
by
some
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
with
some
pretty
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
i
think
it
might
sit
a
little
heavy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
a
very
tasty
stout
with
nice
notes
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
but
a
little
too
lactic
and
sweet
for
me
sweet
rich
and
thick
recommended
drinkability
along
the
lines
of
boulevardes
dry
stout
but
fuller
in
body
i
typically
look
for
an
abv
around
5
or
less
for
this
style
cause
i
like
having
many
at
a
time
this
is
a
tad
high
but
still
it
is
a
great
beer
i
would
recommend
giving
this
a
try
smell
is
of
coffee
with
slight
bitter
action
nothing
complex
but
a
very
clean
brew
finish
is
short
with
no
aftertaste
while
there
are
other
irish
stouts
i
like
more
this
is
very
pleasant
all
in
all
a
good
brew
the
bottom
line
as
irish
dry
stouts
go
north
coast
has
put
together
a
good
variation
on
the
style
there
is
nothing
here
that
is
particularly
memorable
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
stout
like
this
old
38
is
an
affordable
and
tasty
option
i
dont
about
the
style
but
this
certainly
is
a
tasty
beer
i
got
big
milk
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
along
with
chocolate
grains
and
an
aroma
to
match
theres
a
medium
body
with
a
balancing
bitterness
and
touch
of
citrus
hops
flavor
overall
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
and
id
love
to
see
a
coffee
version
of
this
pours
almost
black
with
a
creamy
foamy
semi
lasting
tan
head
smell
is
nuts
and
cream
and
roastiness
hazlenut
creamer
like
notes
flavor
is
dark
and
roasty
slighty
sweet
and
with
a
light
shortly
lived
slightly
dry
bitter
finish
average
body
not
too
thin
but
not
as
thick
as
i
prefer
moderate
carbonation
pretty
good
standby
stout
that
you
could
easily
have
more
than
one
of
not
unhappy
that
i
bought
a
6
pack
of
this
in
las
vegas
nice
beer
this
is
a
good
sipping
stout
that
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
im
still
perplexed
that
the
same
brewery
that
made
the
big
bold
and
brilliant
old
rasputin
made
the
little
engine
that
should
have
but
didnt
old
38
is
a
letdownnot
a
disaster
but
a
journey
into
what
could
have
been
but
wasnt
in
all
decent
d
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
but
still
very
drinkable
i
do
enjoy
their
many
other
offerings
drinkablity
a
very
tasty
and
wellcrafted
brew
old
38
is
a
great
extremly
drinkable
stout
i
enjoy
it
each
time
i
pop
the
bottle
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
trusty
boulevard
goblet
poured
a
dark
dark
brown
that
allowed
tan
hues
to
show
through
when
held
to
the
light
had
a
light
tan
head
that
disappeared
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
nuts
and
almost
buttery
notes
taste
is
heavy
roasted
malts
and
unsweetened
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
hey
thats
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
irish
stouts
on
the
market
dark
brew
with
a
creamy
head
that
dissapated
very
quickly
would
have
liked
to
see
more
head
bitter
hop
and
chocolate
aromas
touch
of
dark
fruit
good
mouthfeel
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
stout
but
thats
how
it
was
made
cocoa
flavors
roasted
maltsbitterish
chocolate
flavor
dominates
this
is
how
guinness
should
taste
i
was
suprised
by
how
much
i
thouroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
very
solid
what
it
lacks
in
inital
apperance
is
made
up
by
flavor
if
yourre
looking
for
a
good
irish
stout
get
it
pours
your
basic
black
with
a
small
cocoa
head
trace
of
lacing
ok
aromavery
metal
like
and
somewhat
medicinal
very
very
solid
roasted
flavor
stands
out
quite
well
deep
plum
flavor
lingering
bitterness
and
somewhat
dry
decent
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
could
see
doing
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
thanks
again
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
again
jdv
poured
an
attractive
dark
brown
with
some
garnet
highlights
and
nice
tan
head
that
dissipated
to
a
small
tan
ring
aroma
is
of
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
is
also
of
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
that
is
balanced
by
the
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
little
lacing
was
left
on
glass
this
was
a
nice
beer
that
i
enjoyed
especially
after
it
warmed
a
little
which
enhanced
the
flavor
very
smooth
with
high
degree
of
drinkability
this
beer
felt
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
it
was
very
smooth
as
i
mentioned
i
felt
that
this
beer
like
most
stouts
was
a
little
better
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
overall
it
was
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
you
could
have
several
of
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
grab
a
sixer
and
ante
up
lads
this
beer
pours
an
impenetrable
black
with
a
nice
and
fluffy
light
tan
head
the
nose
is
very
weak
but
does
have
some
malt
and
coffee
in
it
the
taste
is
wavy
at
first
it
seems
thin
but
quickly
jumps
to
dark
malty
flavors
some
coffee
bean
through
the
middle
and
a
little
vanilla
very
little
though
the
carbonation
provides
a
crispiness
there
is
a
bit
of
coppery
taste
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
thin
and
just
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
very
drinkable
and
a
great
session
stout
a
good
offering
from
north
coast
but
ill
take
old
raspution
instead
every
time
t
it
has
a
nice
coffee
taste
with
a
roasted
malt
too
maybe
thats
just
me
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
is
more
perceivable
2006
from
notes
122006
pours
a
clear
but
deep
ruby
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
fairly
mild
actually
minute
amounts
of
cherry
flavor
hits
with
a
quick
punch
of
sweetness
and
then
the
alcohol
takes
over
in
my
opinion
it
stays
way
too
long
as
it
leaves
a
aftertaste
on
the
mouth
just
seems
a
bit
too
much
though
it
doesnt
completely
overpower
i
wonder
what
age
would
do
to
that
slight
cherry
tone
feel
is
slightly
syrupy
with
minimal
carbonation
even
though
at
first
the
alcohol
is
extremely
present
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
though
i
doubt
youd
want
to
go
through
too
many
of
these
at
once
poured
into
a
20
ounce
imperial
pint
glass
showed
decent
head
and
body
lots
of
lacing
huge
roasted
malt
tastes
with
some
nuttiness
in
the
background
little
hopper
than
i
expected
which
is
a
good
thing
this
is
the
the
best
irish
dry
stout
i
have
had
to
date
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
and
will
prolly
be
picking
up
another
one
this
is
only
the
45th
time
ive
had
this
brew
and
i
think
north
coast
can
do
better
but
i
also
need
to
fine
tune
my
palate
to
understand
more
what
a
good
american
irish
dry
stout
actually
tastes
like
thanks
agai
deniz
d
balanced
flavors
is
great
for
the
mouth
would
have
one
at
a
time
rather
than
one
after
another
poured
into
oversized
wine
glass
pours
nearly
black
but
is
more
like
a
deep
dark
brown
tan
head
doesnt
last
too
long
and
leaves
nothing
behind
no
lacing
smell
is
of
chocolate
dark
and
what
seems
to
be
a
slightly
tart
fruit
maybe
a
little
raisin
like
cant
quite
place
it
taste
is
of
toasted
grains
almost
burnt
and
some
dark
chocolate
and
again
the
fruit
which
i
still
cant
place
very
crisp
tasting
and
very
light
bodied
leaves
a
dry
chocolate
taste
in
the
mouth
i
like
the
lower
abv
this
makes
it
easier
to
enjoy
a
few
in
one
session
not
quite
old
rasputin
but
a
great
offering
thin
tan
head
on
a
dark
brown
body
with
reddish
light
shining
around
the
edges
little
lacing
that
isnt
very
sticky
chocolate
ice
cream
nose
seriously
though
in
ice
cream
form
good
roasted
malt
taste
smooth
feeling
both
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
way
down
nice
roasted
palate
this
is
another
good
stout
allinall
i
thought
this
a
very
nice
dry
stout
im
not
sure
where
i
got
this
particular
sample
but
i
believe
i
picked
it
up
during
murrays
wine
spirits
goingoutofbusiness
sale
a
nice
tasty
beer
bottom
line
nice
smoky
stout
best
served
slightly

pours
a
dark
colalike
brown
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
aroma
is
a
combination
of
burnt
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
taste
is
roasted
malt
up
front
with
notes
of
coffee
and
cocoa
and
an
appealing
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
beer
leaves
a
nice
warming
sensation
in
your
stomach
this
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
for
a
stout
with
a
taste
that
begs
you
to
keep
sipping
nice
offering
north
coast
is
a
very
solid
brewery
indeed
1
inch
head
frothy
lightbrown
weak
aroma
toasted
burnt
mild
coffee
nothing
much
else
not
very
impressed
would
have
expected
more
from
the
brewery
that
produces
rasputin
coffee
was
th
eonly
distinctive
aroma
or
taste
im
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
is
since
i
picked
it
up
at
kclingers
in
hanover
pa
this
lacks
the
effortless
quaffability
that
a
certain
stout
from
dublin
does
but
still
it
makes
for
a
nice
drink
and
i
could
absolutely
see
myself
revisiting
this
in
the
future
d
like
it
better
than
guiness
doesnt
have
that
flat
taste
like
the
other
does
really
lets
me
know
im
drinking
a
beer
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
alcohol
low
enough
to
be
sessionable
stouts
always
look
dark
brown
to
black
and
this
one
is
no
exception
looks
like
coffee
with
a
tan
head
i
think
the
roasting
of
the
malt
sort
of
gives
this
beer
a
semisweet
coffeelike
taste
this
is
a
nice
smooth
stout
thats
not
too
bitter
or
pungent
i
would
classify
this
beer
as
one
of
the
better
stouts
around
pours
almost
black
with
a
nice
creamytan
head
smells
of
some
malts
coffee
toffee
chocolate
smokey
and
nuts
subtle
flavors
of
sweetness
along
with
every
flavor
the
aroma
promised
a
little
dry
and
bitter
finish
same
with
the
carbonation
a
little
had
everything
you
could
want
in
a
stout
just
more
mild
than
i
would
like
in
each
category
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
and
could
drink
as
many
as
i
please
d
a
great
beer
easily
sessionable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
great
product
from
north
coast
kind
of
like
a
miniold
rasputin
in
a
way
this
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
a
1
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
a
somewhat
floral
the
taste
is
roasted
caramel
malty
and
the
hops
were
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
that
seems
to
go
down
easy

i
swear
i
just
had
a
full
glass
here
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
and
one
i
would
be
able
to
drink
a
couple
of
in
a
night
tasty
and
a
nice
ild
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
make
it
a
nice
mild
flavored
stout
d
flawless
i
could
session
with
this
on
a
hot
day
or
sip
it
slowly
from
a
snifter
in
the
winter
this
is
a
remarkable
brew
that
imo
is
highly
underrated
d
this
is
a
really
good
stout
although
it
seems
more
like
an
oatmeal
stout
than
an
irish
dry
still
it
was
very
good
this
stout
was
a
nice
surprise
poured
dark
brown
with
a
caramel
hue
shinning
through
that
left
a
fizzy
one
finger
tan
head
the
head
didnt
stick
around
for
long
the
true
enjoyment
is
in
the
aroma
upon
pouring
a
blast
of
roasted
grain
molasses
and
caramel
hit
my
nose
followed
by
dates
cola
and
licorice
that
ended
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
dark
plum
this
light
to
medium
body
brew
started
off
with
a
roasted
and
smokey
malt
that
was
mask
by
a
sweet
cola
and
date
middle
a
moderate
coffee
bitter
such
as
espresso
was
left
lingering
on
the
palate
another
plus
you
can
drink
this
all
night
and
really
enough
it
really
good
beer
by
north
coast
i
paired
this
brew
up
with
homemade
cherry
cola
bbq
sauce
and
baby
back
ribs
green
apple
cole
slaw
and
roasted
garlic
potato
salad
enjoy
notes
another
winner
from
north
coast
really
blows
the
big
3
nitroed
stouts
out
of
the
water
flavorwise
excellent
brew
overall
this
is
very
tasty
with
roast
and
chocolate
being
cut
through
with
a
knife
wielding
hop
dry
crisp
refreshing
and
very
exacting
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
well
crafted
and
very
easy
to
drink
so
much
so
that
i
will
have
another
highly
recommended
highly
drinkable
ive
had
better
but
considering
the
lack
of
quality
irish
dry
stouts
available
locally
sign
me
up
id
take
this
over
guinness
any
day
and
i
hear
north
coast
will
finally
be
available
locally
within
the
month
nice
rocky
head
steady
and
full
and
fluffy
tan
atop
a
dark
dark
nearly
opaque
beer
with
a
ruby
overtone
the
aroma
is
nice
too
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
nuttiness
along
with
a
soft
caramel
and
toffee
note
the
flavor
is
good
too
maybe
not
as
dry
as
id
expect
for
an
irish
dry
stout
but
thats
a
good
thing
i
get
a
lot
of
malt
at
first
then
a
slight
acrid
bitterness
and
coffee
roasted
note
then
finally
a
little
dash
of
bitterness
at
the
end
that
compliments
the
beer
this
isnt
a
huge
beer
but
it
is
a
rather
nicely
made
brew
with
a
good
combination
of
ingredients
and
flavors
really
a
nice
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
lastminute
dry
finish
i
might
mistake
this
for
a
sweet
stout
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
nice
very
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
reasonable
bubbly
head
that
quickly
disappeared
it
left
slight
lacing
around
the
glass
that
lasted
the
whole
beer
aroma
was
very
pleasant
smelled
of
chocolate
mousse
taste
varied
started
off
with
hints
of
coffee
later
on
was
slighty
sweet
with
chocolate
undertones
no
bitterness
at
all
in
the
mouth
flavorwise
however
the
beer
felt
slightly
acidic
on
the
tounge
which
detracted
from
the
flavor
was
easy
to
drink
except
for
that
acidity
a
solid
stout
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
brew
that
is
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
dont
pass
it
up
if
guiness
tasted
like
thisi
would
drink
guiness
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
and
i
think
my
first
of
the
style
i
had
a
slyfox
dry
stout
and
it
wasnt
near
tasty
as
this
id
dink
it
again
if
it
were
given
to
me
but
i
regret
not
getting
north
coasts
old
rasputin
from
the
bottle
which
was
also
on
the
menu
instead
of
this
one
which
was
of
course
on
tap
oh
well
a
great
irish
stout
from
north
coast
a
wonderful
stout
from
our
friends
at
north
coast
cheers
not
very
good
a
real
let
down
as
the
first
north
coast
beer
i
did
not
really
like
d
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
a
unique
style
for
north
coast
to
brew
and
they
brewed
a
great
beer
none
of
the
flavors
are
overwhelming
they
blend
well
and
leave
a
great
taste
in
the
mouth
id
love
to
have
another
if
i
could
and
if
it
was
at
a
bar
id
feel
it
necessary
to
order
a
second
pint
the
second
serving
went
down
even
smoother
i
am
surprised
to
say
with
the
first
serving
we
find
that
a
combonation
of
acidic
flavors
chocolate
bitter
sweet
impacting
an
unprepared
palate
acts
like
an
icy
hot
patch
at
first
there
is
a
wincing
intensity
followed
by
warm
chocolatey
blandness
i
did
have
one
more
that
evening
and
that
was
enough
for
one
night
perhpas
i
grade
this
brew
to
harshly
but
the
standards
of
beer
must
be
raised
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
respectable
product
in
that
i
could
taste
all
that
i
was
able
to
the
good
and
the
bad
thanks
for
not
following
the
nitroheads
and
being
yourself
cheers

this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
poured
a
very
deep
rubymahogany
that
you
can
barely
see
through
if
held
up
to
bright
light
thinnest
ring
of
small
bubbles
left
around
edge
of
glass
not
very
big
on
smells
can
smell
roasted
malts
but
also
a
sweeter
possibly
caramel
malts
small
coffee
smell
in
there
as
well
bitter
coffee
taste
along
with
some
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
make
up
big
part
of
taste
as
expected
mouthfeel
was
on
watery
side
like
a
guiness
and
had
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
would
pick
this
up
if
tired
of
guiness
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
but
would
not
buy
an
entire
6
of
this
this
is
a
solid
stout
ill
try
to
keep
these
on
hand
d
like
i
said
much
more
drinkable
than
old
rasputin
in
the
sense
that
i
cant
imagine
drinking
a
ris
everyday
plus
as
it
warmed
i
really
got
different
tastes
very
glad
i
picked
it
up
drinkability
roasty
and
tasty
lots
of
dark
flavor
and
a
good
dose
of
pleasant
bitterness
leave
me
wanting
another
sip
great
stout
almost
like
old
rasputins
baby
brother
drinkability
nice
not
overly
heavy
very
drinkable
a
little
tart
easy
to
drink
rich
and
complex
without
being
overly
powerful
alcohol
is
wellcovered
this
is
one
very
nice
stout
i
went
through
a
bunch
of
beers
from
northcoast
of
recent
i
didnt
care
too
much
for
most
of
the
ales
or
lagers
from
the
brewery
but
this
stout
will
be
revisted
time
and
again
thin
but
very
flavorful
deep
roasted
coffee
and
caramel
the
coffee
really
lingers
and
is
nice
the
head
poured
about
1
but
dissapated
rather
quickly
this
beer
at
first
appears
to
be
characterstically
an
average
stout
but
the
taste
raises
it
to
the
next
level
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
stout
thats
drinkability
doesnt
suffer
at
all
from
its
out
of
characterfor
the
style
thin
mouthfeel
imo
this
is
the
best
mass
circulated
northcoast
brew
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
i
will
be
purchesing
in
the
furture
and
will
try
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
north
coast
beer
no
problem
with
this
one
its
totally
enjoyable
though
when
it
comes
to
any
kind
of
stout
north
coasts
own
rasputin
is
still
king
this
is
a
nice
dry
stout
its
not
overly
aggressive
or
over
the
top
in
anyway
and
is
just
solid
all
around
first
of
the
north
coast
brews
that
i
have
had
and
it
is
a
decent
beer
overall
very
good
truthfully
my
only
other
experiences
in
the
dry
irish
stout
style
is
murphys
and
guiness
and
maybe
im
blaspheming
but
i
think
this
one
is
beating
them
out
a
very
solid
pour
d
overall
about
average
for
a
dry
stout
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
fans
of
the
style
should
like
it
drinkability
not
too
heavy
low
carbonation
and
medium
alcohol
level
make
this
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
nice
carbonation
not
much
of
a
head
though
and
quickly
disappears
a
few
nice
island
appear
scents
of
malts
slight
hops
coffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
of
roasted
sweet
malts
and
a
nice
caramel
dry
finish
medium
body
a
pretty
tasty
brew
from
north
coast
would
recommend
thanks
jhammerly
the
drinkability
is
good
but
not
quite
what
i
want
prosit
mk
d
sessionable
and
tasty
id
go
for
this
again
but
this
is
not
a
brew
id
crave
for
good
for
style
very
very
glad
i
tried
this
it
poured
a
nice
dark
reddish
brown
not
quite
black
with
a
very
pretty
slightly
pitted
khaki
coloured
head
that
satyed
around
for
several
minutes
definately
looked
better
than
average
smell
is
dry
roasted
grain
and
fresh
brewed
coffee
nice
taste
is
very
dry
burnt
malt
up
front
with
a
subtle
bitter
finish
dry
all
the
way
through
mouthfeel
was
excellent
for
the
style
i
thought
this
would
make
a
perfect
session
stout
im
quite
impressed
with
this
one
another
winner
from
north
coast
drinkability
is
high
here
i
could
see
drinking
a
lot
of
this
beer
the
body
is
good
for
a
stout
but
the
dry
finish
is
a
bit
of
a
deterrent
in
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
a
low
but
ok
for
style
a
easy
beer
to
drink
but
maybe
they
should
use
less
aged
materials
38
drinkability
very
drinkable
low
in
alcohol
good
flavour
a
nice
offering
from
north
coast
for
stouts
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
in
terms
of
drinking
a
few
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
down
with
over
a
couple
pints
light
and
quaffable
yet
at
the
same
time
chewy
and
interesting
if
i
had
to
perfect
this
i
would
add
a
touch
more
chocolate
and
sweet
malt
notes
to
balance
the
roast
acidity
but
then
it
would
not
be
nearly
so
quaffable
i
dont
know
how
many
i
can
handle
in
a
night
the
flavor
of
burnt
grains
left
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
might
warrent
a
chaser
but
im
too
full
from
the
mild
yet
filling
creaminess
d
its
an
average
beer
kind
of
weak
not
to
bad
though
a
good
stout
itll
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
day
great
beer
good
nononsense
stout
definately
worth
a
try
pours
a
slightly
thin
somewhat
translucent
deep
ruby
brown
looks
almost
like
a
dark
ale
rather
than
a
stout
produces
a
thick

long
lasting
light
tan
head
no
lacing
mild
but
pleasant
aromas
of
charcoal
coffee
beans
bakers
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
fairly
thin
and
watery
with
a
slightly
fizzy
carbonation
initial
flavor
is
of
charcoal
and
charred

followed
by
a
balancing
subdued
malt
and
toffee

some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
also
come
through

light
and
thin

with
a
pleasant

a
solid

nice

the

very
dry

a

appetizing
taste
is
very
roasty
with

and
heavy

notes
the

feel
is

making
this
an
easy
drinker
a
very
nice
stout
medium
bodied
a
bit
light
for
the
style
but
not
bad
fairly
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
for
the
dry
stout
lover
or
as
an
intro
to
the
style
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
that
i
will
have
again
in
the
future
a
nice
dry
stout
flavor
is
robust
and
interesting
as
mentioned
previously
it
is
a
little
thin
but
certainly
drinkable
good
job
while
it
has
some
body
it
seems
a
little
on
the
watery
side
overall
in
body
and
in
flavor
the
flavor
is
nice
and
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
stouts
that
doesnt
just
plug
you
good
for
the
beginner
pours
black
with
a
really
great
head
it
looks
like
a
nitro
pour
but
the
tap
is
just
co2
pretty
impressive
the
smell
is
dry
roasty
barley
with
a
sweet
malt
background
taste
is
dry
bakers
chocolate
the
chocolate
taste
is
strong
but
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
and
this
particualr
pour
is
a
bit
higher
carbonated
than
i
would
have
liked
drinkability
is
good
but
its
a
sipping
beer
rather
than
a
quaffing
beer
sits
a
tad
heavy
on
the
stomach
but
its
a
stout
overall
quite
good
i
would
buy
it
again
and
id
certainly
drink
it
over
guinness
in
the
irish
dry
stout
category
cheers
overall
this
is
a
great
stout
that
can
hold
its
own
against
some
of
the
bigger
names
highly
recommended
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
oelergud
d
the
flavor
isnt
quite
like
any
irish
dry
that
ive
had
so
far
but
damn
is
it
good
however
the
light
body
in
contrast
to
the
full
flavor
is
a
bit
unsettling
nonetheless
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
is
far
too
carbonated
and
yet
it
is
other
than
this
full
and
creamy
on
the
tounge
in
an
impressive
way
but
the
carbonation
is
too
dominant
for
this
style
drinkabilitywise
its
easy
to
get
this
beer
down
and
its
good
but
its
not
better
than
sierra
nevada
stoutnext
to
food
especiallywhich
is
when
i
am
most
often
drinking
a
stout
so
it
does
not
live
up
to
my
hopes
and
dreams
north
coast
crafts
another
notable
brew
that
i
will
alas
not
stockas
like
many
of
their
other
brews
very
good
but
not
best
of
style
d
not
rasputin
light
at
all
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
dim
having
this
as
a
nightcapand
its
great
for
that
not
sure
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
it
is
taste
enough
to
sip
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
sweet
with
chocolate
notes
some
malt
and
burnt
flavors
as
well
this
one
has
similar
tastes
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
and
some
what
of
a
bite
to
it
mostly
a
dry
finish
nothing
really
stands
out
from
this
stout
but
it
is
quite
tasty
just
nothing
that
sets
itself
apart
from
most
other
stouts
this
is
a
bit
thin
bodied
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
it
has
good
drinkability
pretty
smooth
i
can
find
myself
drinking
these
all
the
time
something
to
try
for
any
stout
drinker
overall
a
solid
brew
with
a
definate
hop
presence
another
solid
offering
from
north
coast
cheers
a
great
example
of
an
irish
dry
stout
north
coast
continues
to
impress
me
with
every
beer
of
theirs
i
try
i
was
surprised
by
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
thick
but
not
chewy
in
the
mouth
and
is
not
too
heavy
for
a
stout
on
the
stomach
i
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
and
did
not
feel
too
filled
up
after
it
was
finished
north
coasts
other
stout
pours
quite
dark
but
not
black
with
coffee
highlights
at
the
edges
the
nose
is
all
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
road
dust
thrown
in
the
nose
hints
at
a
very
dry
beer
and
that
impression
is
confirmed
by
the
flavor
of
the
beer
which
is
bitter
right
from
the
start
with
roasted
malts
the
bitterness
softens
a
bit
into
a
more
rounded
hopinfluenced
bitterness
but
this
beer
never
stops
being
bitter
and
never
stops
being
dry
quite
a
nice
stout
but
definitely
meant
to
be
drunk
slowly
the
bitterness
is
too
intense
for
me
at
least
to
bolt
this
down
pours
a
deep
black
color
tinged
with
red
with
a
good
creamy
head
somewhat
bubbled
but
not
too
much
lacing
just
spots
of
foam
running
down
back
onto
edge
not
catching
a
very
strong
aroma
here
but
there
is
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
toffee
duo
going
on
with
faint
dark
fruits
underneath
thats
pretty
nice
but
thats
about
it
so
good
just
need
more
taste
has
good
amount
of
roasted
toasted
malts
the
dark
fruits
in
there
and
its
really
all
good
and
great
but
like
the
aroma
it
just
falls
short
not
enough
strength
to
stnad
up
to
the
taste
its
not
like
i
want
something
bang
pow
super
tons
of
malts
and
hops
or
whatever
but
just
enough
so
it
doesnt
seem
watered
down
or
perhaps
its
because
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
body
thought
it
a
little
lacking
it
finished
off
nice
with
this
nice
dry
roastiness
but
still
lacking
something
still
a
rather
tasty
beer
that
i
want
again
poured
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
abundant
tannish
puffy
head
that
fell
to
a
thin
coating
absolutely
beautiful
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass

roasty
strong

unsweetened
chocolate
also

taste
is
stong
on
coffee
with
strong
burnt
malt
textrires
also
present
strong
malt
gives
way
to
a
profound
hoppy
dryness
finished
nice
and
dry
with
a
lingering
bitter
dryness
as
its
ending
note
nice
and
creamy
and
extremely
refreshing
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
with
great
drinkability
great
job
this
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
black
with
a
large
foamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
faint
with
some
roasted
maltbut
little
else
the
high
carbonation
helps
make
this
a
very
tasty
beer
the
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavors
are
very
pronounced
in
this
beer
the
mf
is
medium
with
a
very
good
balance
of
flavors
ending
with
a
toffee
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
should
not
be
missed
north
coast
is
a
fine
brewer
an
ok
stout
but
i
doubt
that
i
would
buy
this
again
this
just
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
of
other
stouts
on
the
market
old
no
38
pours
with
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
lasting
head
of
foam
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
this
stout
isnt
too
dark
with
ruby
highlights
evident
along
the
sides
of
my
pint
glass
as
i
hold
it
up
to
the
light
one
of
the
best
things
about
this
beer
is
its
cocoalike
aroma
almost
more
reminiscent
of
baking
chocolate
this
isnt
a
very
fullboded
stout
which
is
probably
one
of
the
characteristics
that
puts
into
the
dry
category
the
predominant
flavor
in
this
stout
is
chocolate
malt
with
a
slightly
roasted
coffee
finish
accented
by
big
bitter
burst
of
hops
a
superb
silkly
smooth
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
whole
experience
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
pours
out
a
nice
head
that
falls
and
leaves
a
strong
lacing
the
smell
is
chocolately
with
a
little
coffee
smooth
and
inviting
taste
is
bitter
chocolate
with
a
nice
coffee
aftertaste
this
is
the
hoppiest
stout
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
from
the
west
coast
the
hops
even
out
the
flavor
as
you
drink
feels
smooth
in
the
mouth
its
a
little
different
than
the
malty
stouts
i
predominately
try
but
still
very
nice
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
black
color
stout
with
a
bigger
then
average
creamy
offwhite
head
with
pretty
good
retention
aroma
of
coffee
was
pretty
intense
with
some
roasted
malt
coffee
taste
was
not
as
dominant
as
i
would
have
expected
because
of
the
aroma
body
is
quite
light
with
low
carbonation
hops
level
is
definitely
too
low
for
my
own
taste
not
bad
overall
but
a
bit
boring
i
guess
my
girlfriend
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
since
we
both
like
north
coast
pranqster
so
much
it
appears
black
in
the
tall
mug
that
i
poured
it
into
held
against
the
light
it
is
a
very
rich
dark
brown
this
beer
pours
thick
with
a
very
thin
mocha
colored
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
fairy
ring
with
some
lacing
as
i
drink
it
the
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
lurking
in
the
shadows
it
tastes
full
of
roasted
chocolate
and
caramel
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
is
really
good
but
it
comes
off
lacking
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
really
it
seems
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
and
that
may
be
it
it
has
the
potential
flavor
but
the
body
just
doesnt
back
it
up
i
can
definitely
drink
more
of
this
but
it
always
makes
me
want
to
tweak
with
the
recipe
in
my
head
trying
to
make
it
better
this
was
oh
so
average
nothing
to
see
here
folks
move
along
black
body
topped
with
a
slight
tan
head
giving
way
to
some
lacing
smell
is
very
muted
a
little
roastedness
and
coffee
shine
through
the
taste
is
roasty
coffee
but
it
doesnt
really
finish
dry
and
the
body
was
too
thin
i
could
drink
this
one
again
but
i
might
be
bored
yawn
well
on
to
the
next
one
overall
a
stout
that
is
just
on
the
edge
of
bursting
with
flavor
but
just
doesnt
quite
go
over
the
edge
smooth
and
easy
drinking
drinkability
relatively
lightbodied
for
a
stout
and
low
in
alcohol
this
is
very
drinkable
but
would
be
even
more
so
if
it
had
a
stronger
flavor
jet
black
pour
from
12oz
bottle
with
nice
tan
head
taste
has
nice
roasted
malt
taste
but
also
seems
crisp
for
lack
of
a
better
description
not
a
bad
stout
but
somehow
i
feel
a
bit
disappointed
with
it
definitely
worth
a
try
though
a
bit
lighter
in
taste
perhaps
than
some
of
my
favorites
in
this
style
another
winner
from
a
fine
brewery
drinkability
this
is
a
masterful
easy
drinking
uncomplicated
beer
this
would
be
a
perfectly
sessionable
beer
pours
a
nice
rich
brown
with
a
tan
head
smell
was
roastedbut
sour
i
was
not
crazy
about
the
smell
mouth
feel
is
waterywith
little
carbionation
taste
was
fairly
light
and
roastedwith
a
slight
hop
kick
this
beer
looks
much
better
than
it
tastes
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
altogether
the
thinness
of
this
brew
makes
it
quite
refreshing
if
nothing
else
and
more
drinkable
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
this
on
tap
or
the
imperial
version

nevermind
this
brew
pours
a
black
color
the
head
is
onefinger
in
height
with
a
speckled
off
white
and
light
tan
color
lacing
is
fairly
good
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
more
roasted
malt
and
a
lot
more
chocolate
there
is
a
lot
more
aroma
than
i
would
expect
from
an
irish
dry
stout
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
roated
malt
with
chocolate
tones
in
general
the
taste
is
mellow
not
mellow
in
that
it
is
lacking
or
faint
because
it
is
flavoful
instead
i
mean
mellow
in
that
it
is
simple
and
relaxing
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
guinness
the
finish
is
quite
dry
with
a
huge
bitter
lingering
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
strange
since
i
cant
particularly
taste
hops
in
this
stout
this
is
not
a
beer
i
will
be
purchasing
again
unfortunately
this
beer
is
nothing
compared
to
old
rasputin
which
isnt
available
around
here

thats
ok
for

dark

strong
roasted

some
hopped

and
sweet

notes
the
mouth
feel
is
really
very
nice
both
chewy
and
slick
but
finishes
very
dry
and
refreshing
not
the
most
complex
or
bold
stout
on
the
market
but
defiantly
one
that
could
that
could
be
drunk
right
after
another
cheers
mahogany

up

exposing
an
aroma
of
sassafras
and
brown
sugar
followed
by
powdery
sweet

taste
is
darker
and
more
pungent
than
the
aroma
suggests
its
very
even
without
any
flavors
taking
over

by

followed
by

with

very
drinkable
for
my
tastes
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
sending
this
one
along
what
a
fantastic
beer
nothing
like
old
rasputin
but
equally
impressive
this
is
another
fine
beer
from
the
north
coast
brewing
company
i
really
need
to
get
out
to
california
overall
a
good
beer
there
are
better
choices
out
there
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
especially
if
your
looking
for
a
more
bitter
stout
this
is
a
fine
stout
i
can
definitely
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
this
beer
is
dark
it
had
a
small
head
at
first
but
that
went
away
rather
quickly
it
has
a
very
bitter
taste
and
that
certainly
affects
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
think
there
are
better
stout
choices
out
there
but
this
one
would
work
if
needed
too
bitter
af
an
aftertaste
to
suit
me
from
notes
poured
deep
deep
brown
color
with
rusty
hues
and
sparse
head
nose
was
roasty
and
chocolatey
but
more
in
the
roasty
department
i
enjoyed
it
taste
was
not
as
good
as
the
nose
it
was
mostly
roasted
with
a
light
hop
bitter
but
a
lingering
hop
that
stuck
around
just
a
bit
too
long
for
my
taste
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
touch
of
the
chocolatey
sweetness
in
there
as
well
the
feel
was
light
moderate
with
an
active
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
flavor
was
a
touch
thin
for
me
but
otherwise
good
serviceable
pleasant
stout
with
roast
in
nose
dark
black
roasted
barley
and
chicory
and
some
sourness
in
finish
and
chocolate
bar
sugar
and
bit
of
chocolate
malt
no
complaints
with
this
brewery
medium
mouthfeel
with
biscuit
crumbs
dry
aftertaste
medium
body
and
frothy
the
best
most
robust
of
the
three
i
think
but
not
outstanding
the
burnt
dark
chocolate
taste
and
metallicastringent
finish
makes
this
a
difficult
taste
to
aquire
a
good
stout
all
around
very
impressive
thick
dense
head
for
a
nonnitro
stout
enjoyable
late
blooming
flavors
again
that
take
the
flavor
profile
to
another
level
west
coast
version
of
a
bells
kalamazoo
stout
perhaps
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
ruby
tint
to
it
the
head
is
slightly
dark
tan
it
is
fluffy
and
fades
slowly
leaving
decent
lacing
it
smalls
malty
it
has
a
sweet
molasses
aroma
to
it
roasted
malt
aroma
is
present
it
has
a
slight
chocolate
aroma
also
it
has
a
stromg
coffee
flavor
to
it
the
roasted
malts
are
quite
present
it
is
sweet
with
a
little
chocolate
flavor
very
roasted
though
that
is
the
strongest
flavor
i
detect
this
beer
is
thick
and
smooth
it
is
full
bodied
leaving
a
coffeelike
taste
on
the
palate
it
is
carbonated
well
i
think
that
beer
might
make
a
good
session
beer
it
is
low
in
alcohol
so
that
wouldnt
be
a
factor
also
the
flavor
while
slightly
aggressive
is
smooth
enough
to
enjoy
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
definately
worth
a
try
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
bitter
latte
dark
chocolate
creamy
milky
flavors
the
nitro
left
it
creamy
and
smooth
took
it
forever
to
settle
btw
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
but
very
full
flavored
a
wellcrafted
straightforward
stout
you
replace
all
the
nitro
guinness
taps
with
this
stuff
and
you
might
have
world
peace
or
something
this
is
quite
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
can
definitely
see
myself
picking
up
some
more
in
the
future
found
in
the
cost
plus
200405
winter
brews
pack
leaves
behind
a
sweet
taste
in
my
mouth
i
could
definately
put
down
a
few
of
these
im
a
big
fan
of
stouts
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
ill
be
picking
up
a
sixpack
of
these
next
time
im
out
impression
understandibly
a
winter
beer
chocolates
make
it
a
beer
that
would
nicely
conclude
any
meal
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
thin
watery
mouthfeel
makes
this
brew
easy
drinkin
but
the
incongruencies
in
its
dna
would
prevent
me
from
repurchasing
ok
the
web
page
notes
that
this
is
a
dublin
dry
stout
now
this
brew
makes
sense
it
is
not
an
american
stout
a
fine
blackish
brew
with
a
frothy
tan
head
lacing
all
the
way
down
nice
you
can
smell
the
chocolate
malts
which
smoothly
flow
into
a
dry
cocoa
powder
quaff
that
finishes
with
traces
of
burnt
toast
somewhat
thin
especially
towards
the
end
of
the
second
pint
a
dry
46
ibus
brew
it
will
make
for
a
pleasant
evening
of
drinking
its
a
good
enough
stout
id
have
no
trouble
recommending
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
dark
deep
tar
black
color
with
minimal
head
retention
the
smells
are
of
molasses
chocolate
caramel
and
dark
rich
coffee
very
strong
in
the
nose
this
beer
looks
and
smells
like
it
could
knock
over
a
horse
the
first
taste
is
of
molasses
outlined
with
malty
notes
and
a
few
bitter
hops
then
comes
the
colombian
coffee
aftertaste
the
strong
freshly
roasted
coffee
flavor
is
highly
acceptional
and
welcomed
throughout
the
beer
the
flavors
of
coffee
molasses
and
sweet
caramel
bounce
back
and
forth
each
taking
advantage
of
their
turn
on
my
palate
old
no
38
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
well
not
too
thick
and
very
refreshing
highly
recommended
to
all
beer
lovers
the
taste
was
favorably
creamy
although
not
very
thick
i
got
hints
of
cap
metals
in
the
first
few
pulls
which
quickly
subsided
what
was
left
to
shine
were
the
chocolate
malt
tones
and
the
mild
hoppy
finish
tastey
stuff
without
a
doubt
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
this
glass
more
quickly
than
i
had
wished
to
what
can
you
do
when
faced
with
a
delicious
beer
drink
it
very
well
done
flavors
were
well
pronounced
and
just
right
choo
choo
deep
ruby
color
clear
with
a
thin
beige
head
aroma
is
predominatly
roasted
coffeelike
and
malty
citrushop
fruity
notes
flavor
starts
with
sweet
malt
followed
by
roasted
coffee
and
hop
bitterness
pleasant
coffee
finish
a
very
enjoyable
drinkable
stout
i
will
make
a
note
to
get
this
one
when
i
can
the
pour
was
dark
with
a
garnet
hue
clear
thin
the
head
rushed
to
a
good
2
fingers
with
a
soap
suds
top
in
just
a
few
minutes
the
head
was
gone
and
the
suds
remained
the
nose
was
of
roasted
malts
and
barley
mirroring
a
mellow
roasted
grain
coffee
with
an
ever
slight
chocolate
somehing
came
up
and
tickled
my
nose
must
have
been
hops
the
mouth
was
thin
high
toned
and
short
it
was
semicrisp
smooth
with
a
slight
hop
underlying
and
mingling
with
the
malt
underneath
it
all
was
nothing
it
was
as
if
only
the
top
third
was
palpable
the
finish
was
thin
slightly
dry
and
very
short
guess
i
expected
more
ive
so
enjoyed
north
coast
brews
especially
the
old
rasputin
pouring
at
room
temperature
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
dark
chestnutruby
color
with
3
inches
of
seafoam
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
and
leaves
a
nice
surface
layer
on
top
of
the
pretty
stout
taking
a
whiff
i
smell
the
aromas
of
robust
brown
malts
giving
a
slight
chocolate
or
almond
aroma
i
also
smell
the
hint
of
some
earthy
hops
there
not
overly
complex
but
decent
taking
a
sip
i
first
taste
some
fruitiness
up
front
sweetness
followed
by
some
chocolate
and
nut
flavors
maybe
even
hints
of
caramel
accompany
the
chocolate
flavor
when
first
sipping
the
finish
is
a
little
more
bitter
than
the
initial
sip
due
to
some
hops
flavors
coming
through
a
little
very
robust
beer
with
a
nice
feel
the
carbonation
is
not
overpowering
helping
with
flavor
alcohol
is
not
there
too
much
either
just
a
nice
fullbodied
ale
with
nice
features
that
are
not
blowing
you
away
but
making
you
realize
that
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
you
could
drink
all
night
this
is
a
nice
american
stout
but
i
personally
like
em
rougher
tapnorth
coast
this
was
pretty
tasy
quite
toastyroasty
some
smokeyness
in
there
aswell
nutty
and
chocolatey
long
dry
finish
really
tasty
a
really
good
stout
my
favourite
at
the
north
coast
taprrom
good
balance
and
lots
of
flavour
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
this
beer
looks
great
dark
brown
not
quite
black
body
with
some
ruby
highlights
great
tan
head
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
lots
of
roasted
malt
in
the
aroma
and
slightly
smokey
taste
blech
theres
a
really
metallic
taste
that
is
just
completely
overpowering
it
tastes
like
blood
i
dont
drink
blood
but
have
had
the
taste
in
my
mouth
ive
really
never
tasted
something
like
this
not
good
at
all
i
think
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
this
bottle
im
going
to
try
another
one
sometime
soon
and
edit
this
hopefully
it
will
be
better
deep
black
color
with
just
a
hint
of
a
ruby
highlight
a
thick
dense
tan
colored
head
topped
the
beer
and
slowly
settled
to
a
clingy
sheet
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
has
milk
chocolate
hints
and
something
that
hints
of
blooming
flowers
roses
almost
backed
by
a
pine
hop
hint
the
taste
is
more
acidic
than
what
i
expected
the
hops
come
to
the
front
the
chocolate
is
there
milder
than
i
anticipated
and
delivered
along
with
a
roastednutty
malt
component
medium
mouth
feel
slightly
thinner
than
i
would
want
but
still
very
drinkable
overall
an
adequate
beer
but
not
exceptional
in
a
pinch
it
would
be
fine
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
again
most
excellent
brew
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
an
nice
head
that
persisted
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
an
really
nice
balanced
atste
with
coffee
and
slight
hops
you
note
as
it
first
enters
the
mouth
very
drinkable
it
would
be
a
hit
with
those
who
are
not
huge
fans
of
traditional
dry
stout
pours
dark
brown
was
expecting
black
so
that
explains
my
low
appearence
score
but
besides
that
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
beer
i
aroma
is
nice
with
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
hops
the
taste
is
not
to
bitter
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
little
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
dead
on
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
would
call
it
a
porter
not
a
stout
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
especially
for
a
stout
body
is
very
light
more
like
a
brown
ale
bordering
on
watery
not
bad
tasteing
certainly
not
stout
enough
for
my
expectations
though
it
displays
very
little
of
the
requisite
characteristics
of
this
style
for
that
its
score
suffers
dark
chocolate
brown
almost
black
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
with
lingering
toffeesemisweet
chocolate
notes
smooth
with
the
chocolate
flavors
really
coming
out
in
the
taste
and
a
nice
light
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
no
38
is
quite
easy
to
drink
even
more
so
than
say
sn

good
one

comments
this
really
is
stout
done
right
i
was
a
bit
nervous
to
try
it
because
i
did
not
remember
seeing
it
around
before
however
north
coast
brewing
delivers
on
this
one
highly
recommended
drinkability
nice
stout
that
i
would
try
again
if
given
the
chance
would
really
like
to
try
it
at
the
brewery
on
tap
this
is
an
excelent
medium
bodied
stout
it
poured
a
very
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
decent
brownish
head
that
stuck
around
and
created
some
nice
lacing
down
my
glass
the
smell
was
very
smoky
and
slightly
bittersweet
the
flavor
was
great
with
a
nice
blend
of
dark
coffee
flavors
semisweet
malt
and
a
nice
burnt
roastiness
that
tasted
great
on
this
cold
night
definantly
one
of
the
more
drinkable
stouts
concitering
its
nice
body
recommended

then
it
was
exactly
as
it
smelled
and
was
expected
gonna
have
to

is
a

of
hops

roasted

beans

acorns
at
times
it

a

acidic

has

the

of

sweet
with
the

a
slight

very
light

refreshing
actually
a
fairly
nice
stout
to
drink
in
the
summer
light
like
a
porter
but
filling
and
strond
on
roasted

like

very
good

along

is
a

in

causing

pucker
not
my
favorite

are
you
sure
this
is
a
stout
what
kind
it
pours
smells
and
tastes
more
like
a
porter

it
walks
like
a
duck

like
a

hmm
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tan

that
quickly
disappears
smells
like
coffee
and
malts
taste
is
rather
boring
with
carbonation
dominating
and
not
much
mystery
to
it
it
was
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
but
just
not
my
definition
of
a
stout
not
a
good
example
a
little
plain
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
medium
in
body
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
heavy
for
me
good
taste
but
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
lots
of
carbonation
pours
a
dark

opaque

hangs

the

chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
a
chicory
nuttiness
all
dominate
bitter
hops
provide
a
nice
balance
above
average
for
an
ameican
stout
but
nothing
extraordinary
nice
drinkability
at
about
7
30
for
6
this
will
absolutely
be
on
my
rebuy
list
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
black
malt
roasted
scent
that
is
a
bit
dry
and
awfully
malty
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
black
malt
flavor
that
is
dry
and
dark
tasting
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
a
black
malt
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
mediumfull

beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
stout
with
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
an
excellent
sessions
brew
drinkability
a
good
session
stout
that
stands
up
well
to
others
in
this
catagory
while
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
i
also
would
not
try
to
avoid
another
old
38
experience
overall
impression
a
bit
toward
the
bitter
side
of
the
equation
for
a
stout
but
a
rich
and
complex
taste
much
like
old
rasputin
over
all
and
while
im
a
big
fan
of
old
rasp
the
toned
down
version
just
didnt
click
with
me
worth
a
try
and
a
happy
karma
point
but
dont
think
ill
be
getting
another
soon
drinkability
a
rather
drinkable
stout
a
good
pick
for
someone
who
wants
a
beer
with
some
personality
but
would
be
overwhelmed
by
an
imperial
or
other
thick
brew
perhaps
a
nice
stepping
stone
to
that
next
level
of
beer
appreciation
escapes
into
the
duvel
tulip
with
a
large
and
lacy
deep
tannish
head
clear
very
dark
brown
liquid
with
ruby
highlights
roasty
nose
with
a
subtle
smoky
chocolatey
notes
too
a
somewhat
thinnish
body
supports
flavors
of
bitter
roasted
barley
bite
paired
with
some
slight
fruitiness
and
charcoallike
tastes
finishes
with
a
bitter
chocolatehoppy
note
nice
and
drinkable
but
needs
some
more
body
to
raise
it
to
a
very
good
stout
level
as
it
stands
now
it
reminds
me
of
a
robust
porter
in
bodytaste
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
but
this
was
part
of
a
sampler
and
when
i
actually
drink
a
stout
im
usually
surprised
to
find
that
i
like
them
more
than
i
thought
this
was
very
solid
simple
and
easy
to
drink
poured
your
typical
dark
brownblack
with
a
little
bubbly
tan
head
that
disipated
quickly
with
barely
any
lace
to
speak
of
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
coffee
chocolate
some
overripe
dark
fruit
and
burnt
or
roasted
grains
the
taste
was
very
heavy
on
the
coffee
but
in
a
good
way
almost
like
drinking
ice
coffee
which
i
love
and
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
with
a
slight
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
nothing
cloying
or
overly
sweet
and
this
topped
off
the
night
well
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
2
or
these
or
any
stout
except
a
dry
one
like
guinness
hence
the
lower
drinkability
another
nice
offering
from
north
coast
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
hearty
34
inch
light
brown
head
formed
over
the
reddishmahogany
colored
liquid
great
malt
nose
with
coffee
and
chocolate
out
in
force
the
coffee
flavor
seems
to
dominate
with
the
other
grains
rounding
things
out
and
a
slight
hops
bite
to
finish
it
off
maybe
just
the
right
beer
at
the
right
time
and
place
but
this
one
hit
the
spot
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
and
i
thiought
i
would
based
on
the
smell
it
isnt
really
bad
just
disapointing
while
its
better
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
out
there
that
are
truly
bad
there
are
plenty
of
better
stouts
out
there
as
well
north
coast
no
38
stout
a
thin
stout
pours
without
a
lot
of
head
despite
a
vigorous
pour
what
little
head
it
had
was
deep
tan
but
dissipated
very
quickly
the
aroma
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
rich
and
smooth
very
roasted
malt
aroma
as
is
typical
the
aroma
leads
into
the
taste
very
nice
roasted
malt
taste
with
a
bare
hint
of
chocolatetoffee
and
coffee
the
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
is
very
weak
this
is
a
relatively
thin
stout
not
much
to
hang
the
nice
flavors
off
needs
a
backbone
6

6pack
this
brew
is
dark
but
not
dark
enough
when
put
to
the
light
test
is
apppears
to
be
a
deep
red
color
an
aggressive
pour
produced
a
small
frothy
head
that
faded
nearly
as
fast
as
was
made
all
that
was
left
was
a
small
group
of
bubbles
the
scent
is
a
bit
sweet
with
chocolate
tones
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
its
smell
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
chocolate
and
malt
tones
mouthfeel
comes
up
a
little
too
thin
for
me
a
small
aftertaste
finishes
a
bit
dry
i
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
pocket
as
in
one
hand
old
no
38
stout
in
my
other
probably
my
favorite
beer
so
far
from
these
folks
very
very
drinkable
with
solid
robust
flavor
excellent
malt
flavor
with
a
very
drinkable
grainy
chocolate
malt
unmistakability
one
of
my
top
stouts
drinkability
is
good
for
a
stout
i
can
really
imagine
myself
knocking
these
back
like
i
might
an
ipa
good
introductory
stout
but
not
your
typical
north
coast
selection
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
i
wasnt
expecting
much
based
upon
the
color
and
pour
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
stout
with
some
complexeties
and
depth
beyond
its
appearance
a
little
light
in
color
and
body
but
worth
a
try
flavor
starts
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
before
a
big
chicory
and
roast
bite
rises
up
and
dries
out
your
palate
just
in
time
for
a
large
grassy
hop
bite
and
a
long
lingering
dryness
poured
a
black
with
a
ruby
shine
towards
the
base
of
my
glass
had
a
nice
fluffy
tan
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
was
super
soft
and
fruity
with
just
hints
here
and
there
of
coffee
but
in
my
opinion
the
nose
was
too
delicate
and
didnt
stand
up
well
to
the
job
taste
was
subdued
and
full
of
light
coffee
flavors
and
a
more
pronounced
flavor
of
whole
beans
this
went
well
with
the
roasty
malt
flavors
evident
further
down
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
was
not
too
thin
but
it
could
have
been
thicker
i
think
i
would
like
to
see
a
nitrodraught
of
this
as
it
would
be
an
excellent
alternative
to
guinness
which
is
the
standard
in
the
style
i
could
have
thought
this
was
a
porter
overall
a
good
drinkable
stout
nothing
special
but
perfectly
acceptable
the
feel
is
super
full
and
creamy
smooth
without
any
sense
of
being
syrupy
a
very
drinkable
stout
but
just
a
bit
short
on
flavors
pours
a
deep
coppery
brown
with
a
nice
thicket
of
beige
to
tan
colored
head
nice
lacing
toasted
malt
aroma
vanilla
and
cocoa
orange
zest
bakers
chocolate
in
there
too
a
bit
thin
but
the
toasted
malty
flavors
of
a
stout
are
there
rather
quaffable
right
balance
of
hops
good
seemed
light
in
the
body
for
the
style
but
that
certainly
made
it
more
drinkable
a
little
light
for
me
but
still
a
quality
brew
overall
a
good
stout
update

i
originally
reviewed
this
in
2003
but
drink
it
regularly
so
am
posting
an
update
with
a
2005
vintage
i
juggled
some
scores
around
but
over
all
this
is
a
good
stout
that
smells
terrific
a
few
shades
off
midnight
black
full
and
foamy
tan
head
light
burnt
coffeeish
aroma
medium
body
supported
by
adequate
carbonation
could
be
a
little
thicker
delicate
burnt
roasted
caramel
flavors
with
a
commanding
yet
not
overwhelming
hop
presence
sturdy
and
well
built
dry
stout
i
could
easily
have
two
or
thee
of
these
in
a
sitting
mostly
black
in
color
highlights
of
a
darkish
ruby
hue
beige
head
the
apex
was
almost
two
fingers
worth
collapsed
quickly
to
half
that
size
the
remainder
hung
around
for
a
while
it
does
lace
very
well
lightly
roasty
malts
emphasize
the
nose
distant
coffee
and
chocolate
hints
too
stoutlike
and
inviting
tasty
palate
dry
roasted
malts
upfront
far
from
dominating
but
solid
enough
in
the
middle
charcoal
and
chocolate
notes
wafts
through
a
faint
kiss
of
sweetness
the
finish
is
also
dry
but
heavier
on
the
coffee
taste
hops
bitterness
this
is
pretty
much
all
you
want
in
a
dry
stout
exceptionally
drinkable
simple
but
well
constructed
session
brew
material
mediumfull

very
good

just

how

are

that
nitrogimmick
im
very
glad
this
one
is
not

and
a

warmth

spice
also
blends
in
some
nice
malty
roastyness
and
dried
hops
with
a
nice
overlaying
touch
of
fresh
coffee
beans
taste
is
quite
different
then
what
the
smell
leads
on
mostly
a
heavy
roasted
flavor
with
an
older
leftinthepot
coffee
sense
a
milding
roasted
sweetness
and
the
chocolate
is
all
but
gone
from
the
nose
with
only
hints
of
cocoa
powder
and
light
burnt
brownie
drying
that
comes
in
and
through
the
finish
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
start
and
middle
wrapping
up
the
finish
with
a
favorable
little
bittering
and
drying
factions
with
notes
of
cocoa
coffee
and
cinnamon
a
nice
stout
with
a
great
nose
and
a
nice
finish
a
solid
stout
all
the
way
this
is
a
wickedly
good
stout
i
could
seriously
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
what
a
pleasant
surprise
a
fullflavored
stout
but
not
captivating
due
to
its
simplicity
a
good
tasting
session
ale
with
a
highly
thin
mouthfeel
it
was
a
bit
tangy
for
me
to
be
a
drinkable
stout
gigantic
creamy
head
with
excellent
chocolate
brown
appearance
good
malty
aroma
taste
was
a
bit
tart
on
the
raosted
malt
side
with
an
aftertaste
that
was
ok
but
not
great
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
didnt
feeel
overly
smooth
definitely
not
a
guzzler
ok
on
the
sipping
scale
but
not
great
a
stout
that
drinks
very
well
a
dry
quality
that
allows
this
stout
to
be
enjoyed
with
certain
foods
a
stout
that
is
not
as
thick
as
others
but
definately
has
a
nice
kick
to
it
enjoy
if
you
like
bitter
and
not
sweet

that
is
very
drinkable
would
not
mind
seeing
this
one
again
i
like
this
stout
black
in
appearance
but
not
a
black
hole
with
a
very
minimal
head
a
burnt
and
roasty
smell
i
concur
with
putnam
in
that
it
smells
like
a
mint
chocolate
chip
milkshake
good
analogy
taste
is
of
burnt
roasted
coffee
a
very
good
full
mouthfeel
very
milky
i
could
drink
several
of
these
this
was
my
second
beer
of
the
day
had
guinness
extra
stout
right
before
this
one
and
this
one
was
considerably
more
enjoyable
dark
brown
color
medium
head
deeply
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
some
hop
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
smooth
and
slightly
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
some
malt
sweetness
taste
is
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
strong
on
eucalyptus
bitter
chocolate
and
espresso
these
images
recombine
on
the
palate
to
argue
with
the
glossy
cream
and
milk
texture
dry
with
every
possible
bitter
nuance
in
the
spectrum
there
is
a
surprisingly
high
level
of
balance
peppery
twiggyflavored
froth
just
cushions
joints
of
carob
spice
palo
cortado
hardened
licorice
and
cola
this
is
very
good
beer
now
theres
nothing
like
a
warm
stout
on
a
warm
and
muggy
night
this
beer
poured
a
very
deep
and
clear
mahogany
brown
color
with
ruby
tints
had
a
large
creamy
and
clingy
tan
head
the
aroma
was
one
of
bittersweet
chocolate
caramel
and
coffee
with
a
campfire
smokiness
there
as
well
was
surprised
to
see
that
this
stout
was
low
in
bitterness
and
very
very
smooth
nice
clean
finish
which
leaves
a
chocolate
taste
on
the
tongue
dry
finish
and
an
overall
delicious
stout
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
die
quickly
there
is
a
small
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fairly
strong
with
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
nice
start
of
coffee
caramel
and
toffee
followed
by
a
small
hint
of
hops
the
body
is
a
little
light
and
watery
not
terribly
bad
though
the
drinkability
is
just
alright
a
fair
stout
but
old
rasputin
is
better
certainly
not
an
elite
stout
but
definitely
a
very
good
one
that
should
be
tried
id
buy
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
thick
and
steady
tan
head
with
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
but
there
are
hints
of
burned
malts
and
possibly
a
hint
of
coffee
it
has
an
interesting
sweet
character
to
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
little
spicy
and
reminiscent
of
coffee
the
malt
is
also
very
noticeable
very
smooth
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
im
normally
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
i
could
have
several
of
these
without
complaint
looks
like
a
solid
stout
with
a
nice
head
smells
of
maxwell
house
hazelnut
coffee
the
taste
backs
up
that
nutty
coffee
aroma
but
adds
a
strong
roasted
kick
to
it
as
well
quite
good
hops
are
in
the
background
and
never
come
forth
nothing
overpowering
here
but
definitely
a
high
class
stout
from
a
high
class
brewery
didnt
really
pack
the
punch
i
like
in
a
stout
but
not
that
bad
overall
thick
head
with
good
retention
aroma
not
real
powerful
but
had
a
significant
roasted
malt
presence
and
perhaps
subtle
notes
of
coffee
dry
and
bitter
but
not
as
full
as
id
like
was
satisfying
none
the
less
with
good
roasty
malt
flavor
i
enjoyed
their
imperial
much
more
overall
a
very
nice
effort
and
a
solid
stout
i
bought
the
stores
last
bottle
of
this
but
if
i
ever
see
it
again
i
will
consider
stocking
up
on
a
few
more
recommended
originally
sampled
on
25
january
2003
i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
the
schnauzola
has
lots
of
coffee
notes
this
is
an
extremely
drinklable
stout
if
you
wanted
to
introduce
someone
to
stouts
old
38
would
be
a
good
choice
its
very
smooth
on
the
way
down
enjoyable
by
all
this
dark
black
coffee
beauty
with
a
full
beige
head
and
lasting
lace
is
a
sight
to
behold
full
smoky
malt
with
a
sweet
essence
of
camphor
and
molasses
hoppy
tealike
and
citrusy
grapefruit
provide
a
bit
of
tang
a
touch
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
round
out
the
flavors
along
with
an
underlying
light
herbal
taste
and
noticeable
alcohol
fuminess
nice
drinkable
strong
stout
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
my
first
ncbc
stout
hope
to
try
the
rasputin
soon
pour
is
a
nearly
opaque
black
large
rocky
tan
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
aroma
is
dark
roastiness
smoky
ash
and
strong
espresso
flavor
follows
the
aroma
starting
with
some
more
of
the
smokiness
coming
out
at
the
end
thick
and
chewy
on
the
palate
mmm
mmm
mmmm
mmmwhat
a
great
stout
this
is
it
pours
a
dark
almost
black
color
with
an
ever
so
slight
touch
of
red
topped
off
by
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
the
aromas
were
of
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
roasted
coffee
beans
with
mild
undertones
of
hops
and
chocolate
which
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
creamy
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
this
is
a
must
have
for
any
stout
lover
the
old
38
poured
a
black
color
with
some
hints
of
red
in
the
light
a
nice
thick
head
dissipated
to
a
smaller
thinner
layer
over
time
the
nice
tight
lacing
on
the
glass
rounded
out
the
impressive
appearance
i
was
also
impressed
by
the
nice
roasted
caramel
aroma
with
a
subtle
hop
scent
a
caramel
coffee
taste
was
followed
by
mild
bitterness
and
hop
bite
great
roasted
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
pretty
full
and
heavy
and
very
appropriate
for
the
style
i
really
had
a
hard
time
finding
anything
subpar
with
this
stout
very
solid
all
around
the
old
38
wont
really
shock
or
excite
stout
drinkers
but
its
a
great
consistent
brew
overall
well
done
the
smell
of
coffee
roasted
grains
and
slightly
sweet
grapes
hints
at
an
understated
complexity
coffee
accents
the
roasty
sweet
chocolate
front
the
middle
is
malty
and
chocolatey
full
with
a
little
fruit
and
some
milk
a
very
nice
dry
hoppy
finish
is
complemented
by
bitter
chocolate
this
is
a
very
nice
dry
stout
roasty
fruity
hoppy
quite
creamy
with
temperature
this
stout
pours
a
dark
brown
small
tan
head
which
dissapates
quickly
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
and
roastiness
roasted
malty
flavor
is
the
most
prevalent
some
bitterness
in
it
also
flavor
is
strong
but
the
body
is
a
little
thin
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
ill
stick
to
their
old
rasputin
a
very
solid
offering
from
an
amazing
brewery
the
old
no
38
is
a
classic
sweet
stout
that
i
am
fortunate
to
have
access
to
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
amber
tone
that
looks
black
almost
opaque
with
a
mohogany
colored
billowing
two
finger
width
head
looks
amazing
but
its
nothing
compared
to
the
smell
of
this
well
done
stout
with
the
dark
fragrant
roasts
and
strong
coffee
esque
aroma
just
wonderful
the
taste
is
also
a
great
part
of
this
beer
very
refined
with
hints
of
espresso
and
notes
of
dark
chocolate
the
dark
roasted
barley
fills
this
beer
with
slight
burnt
finish
that
is
pleasant
when
matched
with
the
other
flavors
going
on
well
made
with
medium
to
heavy
body
and
a
full
creamy
mouthfeel
to
each
sip
makes
this
one
a
winner
i
could
drink
this
stout
any
day
any
time
any
place
muy
bueno
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a

coats
the

glass
with
sheets
of

as
it

nose
is

with
a
touch

coffee
full

with

is
roasted
malts
and
grains
up
front
quickly
followed
by
notes
of
bitter
burnt
coffee
leaving
a
very
dry
finish
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
improve
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
poured
with
a
2
inch
head
deep
brown
in
color
taste
is
very
much
of
coffee
not
too
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
disappointing
being
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
sweet
taste
nothing
outstanding
or
objectionable
slight
bitter
aftertaste
starts
to
settle
in
after
a
while
this
one
doesnt
really
stand
in
north
coasts
lineup
perfect
for
effortless
drinking
and
id
take
one
over
a
guinness
any
day
black
body
with
ruby
highlights

lumpy
beige

over
the
edge
of
the

excellent
lacing

coffee
chocolate
roasted
malts
floral
hops
and
some
general
earthiness
taste
is

b
the
roasted

then
chocolate

coffee
and
a
long
lingering
hop
twang
with
some
herbal
qualities
mouthfeel
is
slightly
on
the
thin
side
could
use
a
little
more
chewiness
easy
pleasant
enjoyable
drinking
remember
not
all
stouts
are
imperials
not
up
to
neighbor
sierra
nevada
stout
but
a
fine
example
of
a
straight
forward
american
stout
pours
very
well
dark
with
ruby
tingesdoes
have
nice
caramel
color
head
nice
roasty
smellwith
chocolate
and
coffee
in
it
as
wellwhat
a
good
stout
should
smell
like
i
do
agree
with
a
few
others
in
saying
it
is
a
little
thin
and
weak
for
the
styletaste
to
me
doesnt
match
the
smell
a
little
bitterness
in
the
ending
salvaged
this
one
for
me
nothing
great
but
not
horrible
either
the
beer
pours
a
deep
garnet
color
the
head
is
initially
modest
frothy
in
texture
but
erodes
quite
quickly
leaving
a
fair
to
middling
sheet
of
lace
to
conceal
the
glass
light
hints
of
roasted
grains
and
coffee
malt
and
a
pleasant
enough
nose
i
guess
malt
and
lightly
sweet
at
the
start
the
top
disappointing
in
its
feel
a
bit
light
for
this
stout
lover
finish
is
moderately
carbonated
the
hops
adequate
the
aftertaste
dry
maybe
i
should
classify
it
as
a
beginners
stout
certainly
most
stouts
have
nothing
to
fear
from
this
rather
wimpy
stout
not
bad
mind
you
just
a
tad
to
light
for
me
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
chestnut
brownlight
red
color
that
was
very
clear
the
head
was
foamy
and
rich
tan
the
lace
was
full
and
lasting
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
malt
cocoa
coffee
some
sweet
overtones
as
well
the
tastes
were
of
bitter
chocolate
coffee
malt
kind
of
watery
in
the
middle
of
the
swallow
some
slate
near
the
end
as
it
ended
dry
as
this
beer
warmed
it
seemed
to
become
more
bitter
and
the
chocolate
also
seemed
to
become
more
pronounced
to
be
honest
while
rinking
this
i
had
to
check
back
to
the
bottle
and
reassure
that
this
was
a
stout
to
me
it
seemed
more
like
a
porter
over
all
not
a
bad
beer
not
my
first
choice
when
i
think
of
stouts
black
and
opaque
with
a
thin
tan
head
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
aroama
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
with
just
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
flavor
is
much
the
same
as
the
smell
roasted
malt
with
some
slight
spice
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
very
smooth
and
creamy
a
very
drinkable
stout
the
taste
is
very
sweet
good
amounts
of
caramel
and
toffee
backed
by
the
typical
stout
chocolate
and
coffee
finishes
with
a
fair
dose
of
bitterness
very
good
smooth
and
tasty
i
want
more
another
beer
that
falls
into
the
it
made
me
happy
category
fantastic
aroma
like
hersheys
chocolate
syrup
in
milk
crammed
full
of
mochacoffee
notes
and
roasted
malt
but
not
burned
or
overdone
hops
is
there
enough
to
balance
the
chocolatecoffee
sweet
elements
very
drinkable
just
dry
enough
at
the
finish
to
invite
another
quaff
drinkability
good
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
first
couple
sips
but
its
improving
as
it
warms
this
could
be
a
session
beer
on
a
cold
winter
night
why
is
this
a
specialty
stout
deep
mahogony
brown
color
some
light
does
pass
through
the
glass
revealing
that
this
beer
is
not
black
nice
half
inch
or
so
tancolored
head
with
modest
carbonation
quite
a
bit
of
sticky
irregular
lace
aroma
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
alcohol
and
a
slight
fruitiness
taste
opens
with
dark
actually
burnt
malts
and
earthy
flavors
towards
the
middle
of
the
taste
some
sweet
berry
flavors
appear
these
carry
to
the
end
of
the
taste
finish
is
dry
with
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
a
touch
thin
in
body
but
otherwise
excellent
oh
yum
very
dark
brown
color
a
big
tan
rocky
head
that
leaves
a
great
deal
of
lace
aroma
of
dark
roasted
barley
lots
of
sweet
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
tastes
great
the
chocolate
flavors
are
straightforward
with
an
underlying
faint
hop
presence
medium
bodied
with
a
mouthfeel
that
starts
creamy
smooth
becomes
quite
bitter
then
ends
very
dry
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
burnt
malt
and
a
definite
warming
sensation
leaves
me
quite
satisfied
a
very
impressive
stout
highly
recommended
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
nearly
black
and
has
a
thick
medium
tan
head
the
smell
of
roasted
mocha
coffee
and
malts
get
the
mouth
watering
first
taste
of
each
swallow
reveals
an
odd
twang
but
then
fades
to
a
more
pleasant
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
it
has
a
rather
thin
mouthfeel
and
light
clean
finish
for
a
stout
it
could
stand
a
little
tweaking
to
get
rid
of
the
strange
twang
but
maybe
its
on
purpose
not
bad
and
i
can
struggle
through
the
trenches
to
get
through
the
twang
since
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
cheers
my
final
verdict
is
that
for
a
stout
its
only
run
of
the
mill
it
has
some
high
points
like
the
fairly
complex
and
lush
flavor
and
aroma
and
while
a
little
too
transparent
for
what
i
like
in
a
stout
the
resulting
color
is
quite
attractive
but
it
also
has
low
points
like
the
thin
mouthfeel
and
wimpy
head
despite
all
this
for
pure
easydrinking
pleasure
its
not
a
bad
beer
pours
dark
and
rather
clear
with
somewhat
sparse
fleeting
head
and
light
carbonation
copperred
tones
on
the
edges
smell
is
pleasant
enough
but
quite
muted
taste
is
not
as
smooth
as
some
stouts
but
the
crispness
is
interesting
still
has
the
dark
toastiness
one
expects
pretty
good
mouthfeel
and
reasonable
drinkability
a
very
nice
stout
by
one
helluva
brewery
it
is
not
as
think
and
viscous
as
i
would
have
liked
but
this
stout
has
all
of
the
deep
and
dark
roasty
and
sweet
flavors
and
aromas
many
look
for
in
their
brews
well
worth
the
try
prost
mediumfull
bodied
and
pretty
drinkable
though
i
found
the
roasty
character
to
be
just
a
bit
overdone
north
coast
produces
a
quality
stout
with
old
38
the
almost
opaque
pour
features
a
tan
head
that
survives
and
laces
well
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
lots
of
hops
in
the
typical
west
coast
style
this
beer
tastes
of
the
hops
roasted
malt
and
some
javalike
notes
mouthfeel
is
fairly
carbonated
and
appropriate
for
the
style
its
easy
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
fine
stouts
very
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
full
foamy
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
very
good
spiderweb
lace
throughout
the
entire
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
cocoa
and
some
roastiness
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
creamy
the
flavor
starts
with
cocoa
and
toffee
up
front
becoming
very
chocolatey
with
a
slight
acidity
as
it
crosses
the
palate
ending
with
swirling
flavors
of
nuttiness
cocoa
and
biscuit
and
eventually
finishing
with
drying
bitterness
and
a
residual
bittersweet
chocolate
note
deep
burgundy
brown
in
color
with
a
chunky
durable
head
the
head
left
a
nice

deep
sweetened

nice
bitterness
right
up

deep
and
javalike
a
touch
of
strawberry
and
avoiding
all
but
the
slightest
chocolate
tones
a
tad
acidic
and
slightly
thin
this
brew
should
definitely
meet
the
needs
of
dry
stout
cravers
after
letting
it
warm
it
struck
me
right
nice
tan
head
good
lacing
roasted
coffee
cocoa
aromas
slight
nuttiness
mixed
in
to
a
predominantly
coffee
flavored
brew
lasting
dry
bitter
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
fullbodied
flavorful
stout
dark
brown
to
black
color
depending
on
the
light
tan
head
was
fluffy
and
full
then
evaporated
quickly
initial
smells
were
bitter
roasted
coffee
some
thick
chocolate
smells
taste
was
much
the
same
lots
of
roasted
bitterness
sharp
bitter
bite
to
finish
i
think
i
had
it
too
cold
to
start
as
it
warms
more
subtle
chocolate
malt
tastes
emerge
i
thought
it
was
a
dry
stout
to
start
but
the
flavors
erupt
as
the
beer
settles
medium
bodied
tasty
a
good
stout
lots
of
flavors
there
just
be
patient
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
little
of
the
malty
side
there
was
no
bitter
after
taste
it
will
be
a
beer
that
i
will
stock
up
on
and
keep
in
storage
this
is
a
solid
selection
the
nose
is
full
of
both
malt
and
hops
the
head
is
quite
creamy
at
first
but
doesnt
last
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
a
little
overwhelming
but
settles
down
toward
the
middle
the
malt
is
stronger
at
first
but
hops
become
more
apparent
as
you
go
this
beer
has
quite
a
nice
lacing
that
bubbles
quite
a
bit
hints
of
carmel
finish
off
this
beer
definitely
worth
having
on
tap
as
well
good
job
north
coast
black
brown
color
with
long
lasting
head
and
solid
sheets
of
lace
nice
subtle
roasted
flavor
a
very
smooth
utterly
drinkable
dry
stout
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
that
dosent
bear
the
name
of
youngs
another
fine
brew
from
the
folks
at
north
coast
this
beer
poured
out
a
nice
dark
color
formed
a
medium
tan
head
with
some
lace
as
it
subsided
the
aroma
had
definate
malt
and
coffee
smell
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
to
it
slightly
burnt
aspect
to
it
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
lighter
bodied
stouts
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
but
not
one
of
the
best
stouts
out
there
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
sticky
head
that
lasts
pretty
well
smell
is
of
strong
roasted
malt
with
coffee
and
chocolate
mixed
in
strong
coffe
prescence
on
the
tongue
and
slightly
smoky
as
well
the
bitterness
from
the
roasted
barley
is
complimented
nice
by
the
chocolate
undertones
of
the
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
another
great
brew
from
what
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
notes
full
bodied
dry
stout
roasted
flavours
are
done
to
a
t
good
drinking
for
stout
lovers
definite
roast
malt
flavor
and
hops
evident
i
thought
this
was
a
slightly
above
average
stout
that
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
starts
sweet
burnt
malty
notes
resonate
on
the
nose
and
palate
very
rich
silky
smooth
and
creamy
finishes
slightly
dry
and
bitter
another
exceptional
beer
by
north
coast
o
not
earth
shattering
but
a
solid
affordable
brew
pours
an
almost
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
craggy
cap
thick
streaks
of

line
the
glass
on

down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted

slight
cocoa

slight

notes
taste
is
of
roasted

some

bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
low
carbonation
on
this
one
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
irish
style
stout
that
i
picked
up
on
the
cheap
at
trader
joes
but
i
am
not
so
sure
i
would
get
it
again
m
the
feeling
is
good
good
lasting
and
good
ending
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
combined
with
balanced
little
sweet
with
little
bitter
in
the
beginning
dark
brown
basically
black
with
no
light
shining
through
on
this
one
at
all
rich
looking
head
of
tan
on
the
top
hung
around
for
most
of
the
session
the
aroma
was
a
bit
light
lots
of
roasted
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
cocoa
underneath
it
really
dry
taste
but
a
little
bland
for
me
light
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
but
it
lacked
alot
of
depth
to
put
it
over
the
top
into
another
cateogory
still
though
it
was
a
decent
little
stout
with
a
nice
feel
and
a
3
5
percent
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
cheap
stout
that
is
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
winter
time
i
will
make
sure
and
pick
up
another
6
pack
come
winter
time
t
a
little
sweet
for
a
dry
stout
but
this
is
tasty
a
bit
of
coffee
bitterness
upfront
followed
by
some
smooth
and
sweet
chocolate
flavors
end
finishes
with
a
roasted
and
slightly
charred
note
a
solid
beer
and
probably
the
best
stout
in
the
trader
joes
lineup
tastes
great
looks
great
its
not
in
my
top
ten
beers
list
but
its
a
really
good
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
pours
an
opaque
black
body
with
a
23
finger
tan
head
smells
of
many
things
dark
caramel
raisins
dark
chocolate
smoke
and
faint
coffee
complex
smell
but
not
as
complex
taste
as
i
picked
up
mainly
dark
toffee
smoke
and
coffee
followed
by
a
hoppy
bitterness
which
leaves
a
relatively
dry
finish
overall
a
lighter
stout
in
this
style
but
a
good
stout
try
it
out
drink
it
was
free
it
was
not
bad
and
i
think
north
coast
does
some
good
brews
it
was
only
6
for
a
6pack
so
i
figured
this
was
a
poormans
version
of
guinness
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
fullbodied
nice
coffee
flavour
slightly
syrupy
but
not
too
thick
the
best
part
was
its
low
abv
it
makes
a
good
session
beer
as
far
as
cheap
stouts
go
this
ones
now
my
favourite
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
a
good
one
either
i
love
north
coast
brewing
but
this
is
a
miss
for
me
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
when
its
infinitely
superior
more
badass
brother
old
rasputin
is
around
i
often
wonder
if
all
these
bourbon
barrel
aged
choclatey
anisey
american
ris
have
ruined
my
taste
for
more
traditional
dry
irish
stouts
black
with
some
tan
head
little
or
no
lacing
to
speak
of
not
bad
for
a
stout
the
smell
isnt
terrible
but
theres
some
wet
dog
smell
under
the
roasted
notes
that
doesnt
jive
with
me
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
too
taste
follows
suit
largely
roasted
and
chocolate
notes
akin
to
a
guinness
with
a
bigger
mf
mf
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
though
not
terrible
mutes
some
of
the
flavor
decent
drinkability
nice
easy
drinker
id
like
it
to
be
a
bit
more
interesting
fairly
average
pour
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
brown
head
aroma
is
very
rich
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
it
is
a
bit
mild
in
taste
but
still
delicious
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
the
same
mild
but
definitely
not
a
bad
thing
im
by
no
means
a
dry
stout
person
but
mild
yet
delicious
flavors
and
mouthfeel
make
for
a
pretty
damn
drinkable
stout
for
the
price
not
bad
d
for
the
price
a
great
value
stout
compared
to
whats
out
there
i
wasnt
hugely
impressed
but
if
you
want
a
stout
on
a
budget
this
is
servicable
nice
drinkable
stout
here
not
going
to
wow
you
or
knock
you
out
with
huge
flavors
or
alcohol
this
is
just
a
quality
beer
that
tastes
pretty
good
and
is
quite
sessionable
drinkability
great
stuff
maybe
im
over
exaggerating
because
i
havent
had
a
stout
in
a
long
time
but
im
impressed
nonetheless
if
this
is
truly
modeled
after
the
brews
they
serve
in
dublin
and
cork
not
the
stuff
from
st
jamess
gate
then
i
really
admire
and
envy
the
irish
overall
made
a
great
gift
some
light
toast
flavors
upfront
followed
by
toasted
malts
roasted
barley
coffee
and
bits
of
vanilla
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
with
some
medium
bitterness
moderate
carbonation
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
overall
not
the
best
effort
from
north
coast
another
session
bargain
at
tjs
brewed
in
craft
form
d
ok
beer
but
nothing
i
am
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
note
says
irish
dry
stout
clearly
on
the
label
best
served
a
bit
warm
maybe
60
f
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
sharp
but
other
than
that
nothing
of
note
to
the
moutfeel
and
drinkability
ive
been
using
this
as
my
thirsty
beer
the
last
couple
of
days
and
there
is
nothing
preventing
someone
from
drinking
two
or
three
of
these
in
a
row
if
they
are
so
inclined
it
does
not
overly
fill
you
no
single
taste
is
too
overwhelming
to
be
repeated
it
doesnt
really
coat
your
mouth
its
reasonably
seesionable
d
nice
for
the
type
dsolid
just
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
but
i
will
forgive
this
due
to
the
pleasant
dry
roasted
flavours
that
come
through
even
more
so
as
it
warms
drinkability
light
body
considering
the
style
boosts
drinkability
quite
a
bit
black
hart
was
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
obviously
needs
to
be
classified
as
an
irish
dry
stout
prosit
mk
poured
a
dark
brown
with
lots
of
deep
tan
foam
and
some
lace
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
was
the
really
strong
aroma
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
after
taste
was
pleasant
not
over
bitter
this
is
another
surprisingly
tasty
beer
for
the
price
its
got
the
requisite
chocolatecoffee
aromataste
youd
expect
of
a
stout
with
a
bit
of
smoky
hoppy
bitterness
to
round
things
out
decent
but
not
very
longlasting
head
full
complex
body
eminently
drinkable
it
also
becomes
smoother
the
longer
you
keep
it
i
discovered
this
by
accident
an
ex
left
me
a
couple
of
bottles
and
i
didnt
get
round
to
drinking
them
until
a
couple
of
years
later
d
could
probably
drink
as
a
session
beer
something
i
could
enjoy
with
company
and
food
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
but
not
have
to
think
about
drinkability
north
coast
sure
does
churn
out
alot
of
dry
stouts
i
have
trouble
seeing
myself
reach
past
an
old
stock
ale
or
an
old
rasputin
to
try
this
again
pours
black
with
lasting
tan
head
smell
is
nice
and
sweet
molassesy
and
roastiness
taste
is
very
nice
balanced
roasty
sweet
bitter
and
a
hint
of
coffee
with
a
very
drying
finish
very
flavorful
drinkable
stout
quite
good
unique
to
me
and
worth
getting
for
sure
d
each
initial
sip
is
very
good
but
the
after
taste
really
distracts
form
its
drink
ability
would
go
with
other
stouts
rather
than
pick
this
one
up
again
a
thin
mouthfeel
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
certainly
a
session
stout
that
is
very
accessible
and
drinkable
all
in
all
a
good
offering
black
hart
is
decent
beer
that
could
be
better
than
decent
with
a
few
tweaks
at
an
abv
of
5
4
its
wellsuited
for
sessioning
maybe
north
coast
brewing
didnt
want
to
cannibalize
old
rasputins
sales
mission
accomplished
a
mediocre
stout
but
one
that
has
potential
to
be
something
better
too
much
burnt
bitterness
in
the
flavor
which
i
find
unattractive
when
its
not
balanced
in
this
type
of
beer
with
something
creamier
d
pretty
dry
but
drinkable
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
more
than
2
of
these
at
a
time
but
that
doesnt
say
much
since
i
cant
down
a
lot
of
stout
in
general
great
label
i
got
this
beer
on
the
cheap
and
was
satisfied
all
the
way
alright
drinkability
run
of
the
mill
dry
stout
for
me
just
needs
to
be
kicked
up
a
little
i
was
slightly
surprised
how
light
this
beer
was
for
most
stouts
i
expect
no
light
to
penetrate
except
at
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
though
this
beer
let
a
bunch
of
light
through
lighting
it
a
dark
brown
color
the
mocha
head
disappeared
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
malty
for
a
stout
but
still
good
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
dry
for
such
a
malty
aroma
it
has
a
good
roasted
flavor
but
nothing
really
stands
out
the
body
is
medium
to
full
which
is
appropriate
for
a
stout
i
certainly
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
its
not
among
my
favorite
beers
drinkability
the
über
dry
roasty
character
overstays
it
welcome
and
it
soon
enters
overkill
territory
pours
very
dark
red
with
strong
brown
tones
medium
foamy
tan
head
light
lacing
dies
down
quickly
aroma
is
roasted
malts
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
medium
body
with
an
easy
surprisingly
fizzy
mouthfeel
flavor
is
a
strong
roasted
malt
attack
with
charcoal
chocolate
and
coffee
grassy
bitterness
accentuates
the
stronger
roast
flavors
some
mild
dark
fruits
in
the
finish
no
particularly
strong
aftertaste
d
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
enough
its
not
very
filling
considering
the
style
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
but
there
are
others
that
i
would
prefer
within
the
style
lighty
roasty
aroma
with
some
mild
brown
ale
nuttiness
and
very
faint
coffee
suggestions
the
body
is
dark
brown
to
flat
black
and
holds
a
creamy
tan
head
that
is
about
a
thumb
thick
and
lasting
but
slightly
bubbly
on
the
sides
the
first
sip
is
slightly
thin
then
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
profile
comes
through
with
some
cream
notes
and
faint
coffee
tastes
pretty
good
and
has
a
nice
burntroast
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
mite
thin
but
tasty
and
enjoyable
overall
a
solid
american
stout
thank
you
for
your
unending
generosity
ken
i
appreciate
it
last
swigs
roasted
malt
dry
irish
standard
tongue
coating
stout
thanks
to
intriqken
for
the
bottle
very
enjoyable
all
in
all
a
nice
dessert
brew
which
would
pair
nicely
with
vanilla
bean
ice
cream
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
nothing
to
write
home
about
pleasant
enough
overall
not
quite
robust
enough
and
no
where
near
smooth
enough
drinkability
overall
not
a
bad
stout
good
in
the
taste
department
but
a
bit
too
much
fizz
for
me
bought
this
on
sale
at
trader
joes
where
theyre
pushing
irish
food
and
drink
this
month
cause
of
st
paddys
day
this
is
an
intersting
beer
definitely
not
run
of
the
mill
about
the
color
of
cocacola
it
pours
out
thick
with
a
tall
creamy
tan
head
smells
a
bit
sour
tastes
earthy
and
somewhat
on
the
bitter
side
not
a
session
beer
however
more
the
kind
youd
drink
one
at
a
time
should
go
well
with
rich
and
heavy
foods
overall
id
give
this
about
3
5
points
on
a
fivepoint
scale
and
maybe
ill
buy
it
again
next
march
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
on
a
dayin
dayout
basis
overall
one
of
those
weird
singles
that
i
picked
up
at
trader
joes
for
next
to
nothing
i
think
it
was
about
86cents
all
told
a
nice
tasty
effort
from
lost
coast
brewing
co
but
a
tad
too
dry
for
the
long
haul
a
nice
beer
i
prefer
a
sweeter
stout
but
i
enjoyed
this
dry
style
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
this
brew
was
a
real
strange
one
for
me
dry
almost
doesnt
begin
to
describe
the
mouthimploding
desertlike
character
to
this
beer
i
had
to
stop
halfway
through

lots
of
cocoa

w
some
hop
zingers
very
enjoyable
i
am
liking
it
more
and
more
it
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
very
little
foam
and
some
lace
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
was
the
really
strong
aroma
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
after
taste
was
pleasant
not
over
bitter
the
bottle
says
black
hart
then
on
the
bottom
irish
style
dry
stout
poured
from
tap
into
a
plastic
cup
nice
dark
coffee
colored
pour
with
a
inch
or
so
of
cream
colored
head
aroma
was
of
mild
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
hints
taste
was
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
and
coffee
swirling
around
nicely
together
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
slightly
frothy
in
the
beginning
with
a
solid
medium
finish
leaving
a
nice
layer
of
flavor
on
the
tongue
overall
a
nice
simple
stout
that
was
good
from
the
tap
i
really
enjoyed
this
local
las
vegas
brew
just
a
tasty
starter
stout
half
finger
head
with
excellent
lacing
on
a
jet
black
body
aroma
of
milk
chcoolate
and
cocoa
mostly
with
some
roasted
malts
flavor
is
also
mosty
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
a
dry
finish
and
roasted
bitterness
which
is
mild
but
lingers
on
the
palate
for
a
while
after
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
nice
version
of
an
irish
stout
full
flavored
and
not
too
watery
for
the
style
which
is
my
least
favorite
aspect
of
this
genre
o
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
nice
complexity
of
flavor
though
a
little
too
mild
in
the
smell
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
not
hesitate
to
order
it
again
dr
very
drinkable
but
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
expensive
and
of
limited
quality
on
account
of
its
simplicity
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
tasting
cup
of
beer
much
better
than
what
you
normally
find
in
plastic
i
have
a
hard
time
complaining
about
a
stout
on
tap
and
this
one
while
not
the
best
choice
isnt
a
bad
one
either
poured
ontap
at
bar
in
the
venetian
the
beer
is
black
with
a
thin
bright
creamy
colored
head
they
refer
to
it
as
the
dark
side
of
sin
there
is
a
nose
of
coffee
and
earth
the
flavors
are
very
smooth
a
good
creamy
blend
of
coffee
caramel
and
nut
there
is
a
very
slick
short
aftertaste
of
coffee
the
lightness
and
crispness
of
the
beer
is
unusual
for
a
stout
but
very
enjoyable
this
was
tasty
enough
to
warrant
a
growler
fill
on
our
way
home
d
could
have
these
all
night
at
6
d
pretty
drinkable
session
stout
a
pint
went
down
easy
although
it
would
have
been
a
bit
better
had
the
astringency
been
a
bit
more
attenuated
not
much
to
differentiate
it
from
other
beers
of
this
style
had
it
mostly
to
tick
off
nevada
a
notoriously
mediocre
beerproducing
state
d
another
solid
offereing
from
sin
city
as
seems
to
be
the
case
they
make
accessible
and
enjoyable
beers
but
ones
that
are
slightly
above
average
and
far
from
the
head
of
the
class
for
their
respective
styles
into
a
plastic
cup
dohvegas
stock
pours
a
cascading
dark
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
surprisingly
long
time
the
aroma
was
light
maybe
some
chocolates
in
there
taste
had
some
nice
caramels
and
roasted
malts
stock
the
mouth
was
nice
and
creamy
smooth
good
carbonation
easy
to
drink
nothing
great
nothing
bad
a
definitely
good
pickup
when
walking
around
one
of
vegass
400
malls
on
the
strip
not
bad
good
enough
for
another
glass
nothing
amazing
but
not
bad
at
all
an
interesting
albeit
slightly
weak
irish
stout
with
some
nice
character
to
it
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
in
the
realm
of
availability
on
the
strip
good
drinkable
stout
not
an
offensive
beer
just
a
bit
lackluster
for
my
taste
as
a
stout
i
may
have
a
better
take
if
it
were
a
dunkel
d
very
good
i
was
pleased
with
this
one
and
would
have
another
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
dark
black
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
roasty
malt
and
chocolate
smell
creamy
yet
thin
body
thin
flavor
of
chocolatey
roasty
malt
not
really
much
bitterness
or
any
hop
presence
alcohol
is
very
prevalent
in
this
one
and
it
is
quite
watery
not
very
good
but
ive
had
much
worse
the
beer
poured
a
notquiteopaque
redblack
with
a
fair
amount
of
light
tan
head
there
was
no
aroma
it
was
served
rather
cold
but
exhibited
only
a
faint
amount
of
light
roastiness
i
found
this
beer
to
be
disappointingly
approachable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
bit
flat
and
watery
not
a
very
exciting
beer
overall
a
pleasant
above
average
irish
stout
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
an
irish
stout
i
could
see
myself
having
a
six
of
this
that
said
i
will
not
be
in
a
rush
to
get
it
again
any
time
soon
i
love
big
ampedup
stouts
with
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
but
occasionally
i
just
want
a
straight
forward
black
beer
as
john
wayne
calls
it
in
the
quiet
man
the
folks
at
paper
city
have
managed
to
produce
a
perfect
example
of
a
simple
yet
elegant
stout
notes
dam
this
is
remarkable
incredibly
smooth
and
a
great
mix
of
flavors
cheers
o
a
fairly
good
american
stout
but
it
doesnt
match
my
perception
of
a
dry
irish
the
herbal
fruitiness
and
slicker
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
5
5
abv
made
me
feel
more
like
i
was
drinking
a
thinner
u
s
version
of
a
standard
stout
its
not
bad
and
the
bottle
may
be
pastprime
cant
make
out
markings
but
i
couldnt
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
brownblack
in
color
with
a
half
finger
tan
head
that
lingers
in
glass
nice
amount
of
carbonation
oak
slight
coffee
almost
a
hop
smell
to
it
can
t
really
put
words
to
the
smell
smooth
up
front
with
a
little
carbonation
very
nice
not
very
complex
simple
and
just
good
d
great
drinkability
with
the
tasty
flavor
you
want
with
a
stout
these
can
be
drank
very
smoothly
a
fine
example
of
the
style
worth
a
try
notes
one
of
the
best
tasting
irish
dry
stouts
ive
ever
had
im
glad
i
live
only
a
few
minutes
from
the
brewery
and
have
easy
access
to
this
gem
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
one
is
a
very
easy
drinker
and
enjoyable
as
well
drinkable
but
not
very
complex
this
can
serve
as
an
excellent
gateway
between
guinness
and
other
stouts
pours
pitch
black
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
three
finger
creamy
light
tan
head
which
ends
up
retaining
at
about
one
finger
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
pretty
thick
lacing
is
left
behind
by
this
one
a
good
looking
irish
stout
instantly
as
i
smell
this
one
i
think
of
a
guinness
lots
of
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
vanilla
a
coffee
like
smell
that
could
come
from
a
grain
of
some
sort
the
smell
dies
down
pretty
quickly
and
i
have
a
hard
time
picking
it
up
again
taste
is
also
that
of
roasted
malts
chocolatemocha
and
some
hops
earthy
ones
part
way
into
the
beer
the
roastyness
i
enjoyed
seems
to
disappear
and
allow
the
hops
and
sweetness
to
come
through
a
bit
too
much
i
wish
the
initial
taste
stayed
there
mouthfeel
is
decent
for
an
irish
dry
but
still
a
bit
watery
to
me
personally
the
carbonation
feels
appropriate
for
the
body
and
taste
no
warming
whatsoever
going
on
here
drinkability
is
good
the
taste
is
not
bad
the
price
is
good
there
are
no
huge
off
flavors
to
take
over
the
beer
and
ruin
it
totally
it
was
certainly
worth
trying
as
i
enjoy
stouts
very
much
but
im
not
sure
if
i
will
get
this
one
again
pours
black
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
very
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
nicely
balanced
aromas
of
a
medium
roastiness
slightly
sweet
malt
and
some
creaminesss
and
some
earthiness
th
flvor
is
similar
quite
balanced
between
sweet
cream
and
a
dry
roastinrss
as
well
as
a
bitter
earthiness
and
a
hint
of
almondlike
nuttiness
very
dry
and
with
a
late
tight
bitterness
pretty
enjoyable
stuff
from
a
brewery
that
is
new
to
me
the
taste
pretty
well
follows
the
aroma
there
are
deep
roasted
dark
grains
chocolate
and
mocha
coffee
the
beer
is
very
creamy
very
smooth
there
isnt
any
bite
or
charred
flavors
the
beer
is
a
touch
sweet
but
has
nice
drying
qualities
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
maybe
a
touch
watery
there
is
some
drying
notes
in
the
finish
and
there
is
a
distinct
coffee
mocha
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
there
maybe
a
slightly
nutty
quality
to
the
beer
but
the
coffee
flavors
are
the
most
striking
im
not
a
big
coffee
guy
but
this
beer
is
good
so
that
is
saying
something
right
there
the
chocolate
notes
are
a
touch
powdery
bittering
not
sweet
at
all
and
really
just
deep
dark
cocoa
this
is
a
nice
creamy
beer
that
has
a
lot
going
for
it
lchaim
overall
good
drinkability
a
little
too
much
carbonation
really
good
roasted
flavors
with
sweet
chocolate
to
balance
it
out
overall
good
brew
but
its
just
not
very
exciting
i
would
buy
it
again
quite
dark
not
much
of
a
head
what
was
there
was
airy
and
bubbly
lightly
roasted
aroma
with
some
vanilla
and
apricots
and
even
a
little
bubble
gum
more
roastiness
in
the
taste
but
it
was
swept
aside
by
the
hops
which
came
on
a
bit
stronger
than
i
expected
rather
thin
in
the
body
but
thats
what
made
this
pleasant
to
drink
on
a
nearlyspring
day
in
new
england
not
too
thick
but
still
heavy
enough
for
a
chilly
afternoon
winter
pleasant
enough
when
youre
seeking
a
lighter
stout
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
tannish
head
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
very
roasty
smelling
nice
touch
to
it
taste
it
of
roasted
nuts
very
malty
but
smooth
nice
mouthfeel
and
body
to
it
and
finishes
dry
i
havent
had
much
from
this
style
but
i
find
it
smoother
than
guinness
while
it
isnt
spectacular
its
by
the
best
in
their
mixed
12
pack
other
3
are
below
average
for
sure
and
was
glad
i
saved
this
one
for
last
give
it
a
try
if
youre
into
irish
stouts
picked
up
a
single
from
party
source
in
syracuse
this
is
a
good
rippingly
dry
irish
stout
it
makes
a
touch
in
complexity
but
the
almost
sour
black
roasted
malts
are
big
and
bad
delicious
the
appearance
is
pitch
black
with
a
tan
head
i
could
drink
more
of
these
comes
off
very
traditional
in
the
best
way
a
little
heavier
than
the
true
irish
stout
beamish
etc
but
hardly
less
sessionable
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
colored
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
holds
strong
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
consists
of
dark
roasted
malts
toasted
grains
and
coffee
grinds
light
cocoa
powder
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
and
some
earth
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
begins
with
some
ashy
wood
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
nuts
midway
a
vanilla
flavor
emerges
with
a
dirty
hop
flavor
aftertaste
is
pretty
dry
with
smoke
and
caramel
on
the
tongue
medium
body
with
a
slick
and
creamy
feel
very
fitting
for
the
style
the
fairly
low
abv
and
smooth
feel
make
this
an
easy
drinking
brew
for
sure
i
like
this
one
over
their
mothers
milk
very
solid
irish
dry
stout
this
is
a
crisp
brew
quite
creamy
and
is
easy
drinking
one
of
the
better
local
brews
as
well
as
one
of
the
best
irish
stouts
ive
had
worth
a
try
great
appearance
dark
black
look
with
some
nice
thin
lacing
the
smell
is
pretty
sharp
and
rich
good
amounts
of
malt
chocolate
coffee
all
of
which
is
nicely
roasted
the
taste
has
some
of
those
sharp
flavors
but
there
is
a
good
dry
sense
of
hops
included
as
well
crisp
mouthfeel
allows
for
a
full
bodied
drink
that
definitely
fills
you
up
for
st
patricks
day
overall
one
of
massachusetts
finest
overall
a
sessionable
brew
with
good
attributes
thanks
again
john
i
liked
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
scent
as
well
as
a
coffeelike
patent
malt
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
that
adds
just
enough
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
very
dry
roasted
malt
flavor
its
got
an
earthy
black
malt
feel
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
these
guys
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
great
a
fine
stout
poured
into
standard
pint
glass
a
nice
very
dark
brown
but
not
quick
black
opaque
color
head
was
about
1
finger
reddish
brown
that
disappeared
quickly
after
pouring
and
before
drinking
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
not
sickeningly
so
but
had
touches
of
coffee
and
maybe
caramel
tasted
the
same
not
at
all
bitter
very
easy
to
drink
tasted
slightly
better
warm
than
cooled
a
nice
solid
stout
notes
top
notch
irish
dry
stout
exceeds
guinness
extra
stout
by
far
a
perfectly
blended
stout
that
prides
itself
on
many
characters
and
drinkability
well
done
wow
what
a
damn
nice
stout
silky
smooth
with
a
load
of
classic
stout
flavors
i
really
wasnt
expecting
anything
this
nice
from
paper
city
drinkability
notes

hopefully
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
maybe
i
can
find
a
fresher
sample
pretty
thin
pretty
simple
somewhat
disappointing
but
this
would
definitely
be
a
quaffable
brew
which
i
think
is
the
goal
for
traditional
irish
stout
creamy
body
and
medium
carbonation
makes
this
one
quite
drinkable
finishes
dry
and
crisp
very
nice
dry
stout
from
paper
city
this
could
definately
be
a
session
beer
for
me
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
smallish
head
that
quickly
evaporates
no
lace
on
my
glass
as
it
was
going
down
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
malt
and
a
something
sweet
filled
my
nose
tastes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
smoke
left
a
dry
taste
in
my
mouthoverall
drinkability
is
good
sucked
this
guy
down
and
could
have
a
few
more
still
ive
had
better
irish
stouts

this
one
was
good
for
the
money

but
a
good
representative
of
it
looking
at
others
reviews
i
could
recognize
vanilla
lime
seltzer
scent
of
chocolate
a
lot
of
the
trademark
dryness
and
i
think
i
can
see
gingerplus
the
fairly
excellent
drinkability
nice
drinkability
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
too
strong
drinkability
i
have
in
my
notes
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
it
wasnt
a
big
stout
but
a
very
drinkable
one
not
very
complex
but
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
definitely
worth
it
to
sample
once
such
a
promising
beer
it
looks
fantastic
with
its
thick
brown
head
atop
a
body
of
pure
black
the
deep
chocolate
aroma
is
even
better
and
theres
a
slight
whiff
of
alcohol
something
goes
awry
between
this
point
and
the
taste
it
maintains
a
certain
level
of
chocolate
character
with
a
little
vanilla
flavor
as
well
but
a
tartness
follows
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
unpleasing
there
is
also
a
watery
consistency
which
is
probably
the
first
thing
that
i
would
change
about
this
beer
sorry
to
be
the
party
wrecker
but
this
is
not
my
bag
wow
this
is
great
dark
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
thick
lumpy
head
that
sinks
quickly
but
leaves
big
sheets
and
fingers
of
oily
lace
around
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
malty
and
smokey
with
some
fig
and
cocoa
flavor
is
round
and
smooth
a
bit
chalky
with
a
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
flavor
very
creamy
with
a
bitter
coffee
finish
some
raisin
and
hops
burps
a
tiny
bit
of
a
tannic
and
citrusy
pucker
and
a
bitter
mocha
flavor
in
the
lingering
aftertaste
really
good
beer
but
didnt
deliver
as
i
expected
its
flavor
was
light
and
fleeting
finish
was
fast
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
but
flavor
diminished
with
a
watery
note
which
left
me
wondering
where
the
rest
of
the
stout
was
flavor
is
powerful
which
is
a
nice
change
heavy
roastiness
with
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
a
touch
of
estery
currant
esters
body
feels
a
bit
more
than
your
average
stout
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
carbonation
was
too
much
and
i
feel
like
it
killed
some
of
the
beers
subtleties
solid
dry
finish
with
a
perceptable
hoppiness
altogether
i
was
really
impressed
great
stuff
one
of
paper
citys
better
brews
im
not
a
real
fan
of
stouts
but
with
more
like
this
offering
i
could
be
won
over
this
is
a
local
beer
for
me
and
believe
it
or
not
i
got
a
six
for
under
5
bucks
what
a
great
deal
beautiful
almost
black
color
with
a
creamy
head
with
various
size
bubbles
nice
hop
aroma
taste
a
nice
subtle
coffee
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
slight
hoppy
aftertaste
that
was
excellent
very
easy
to
drink
its
verrrry
smooth
highly
recommend
this
is
one
drinkable
irish
stout
pitch
black
with
a
foamyfrothy
lasting
head
trails
of
sliding
and
some
sticky
lace
smoke
floral
hop
and
malty
aroma
the
full
rich
body
is
reminiscent
of
an
oatmeal
stout
but
this
is
a
bit
dryer
sweet
molasses
and
burnt
caramel
hints
of
crème
brulee
fairly
high
in
citrus
and
tealike
bitterness
and
somewhat
noticeable
alcohol
and
ever
so
slightly
astringent
this
stout
poured
an
opaque
black
color
with
creamy
light
brown
foam
that
adhered
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
contained
some
yeast
oatmeal
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
hops
initially
but
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
also
came
through
the
taste
had
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
some
sweetness
oatmeal
though
this
was
not
a
sweet
stout
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
touch
of
astringency
in
the
finish
the
body
was
medium
this
was
a
nicely
drinkable
stout
excellent
stout
poured
a
nice
dark
color
with
great
choco
bubbles
had
a
great
roasted
coffee
taste
creamy
which
is
a
quality
i
look
for
in
a
stout
smooth
tasting
i
took
large
gulps
drinking
this
beer
like
water
six
pack
next
time
a
single
bottle
is
just
a
tease
this
beer
tasted
more
along
the
lines
of
a
porter
than
a
real
hearty
stout
this
beer
had
practically
no
head
which
sort
of
bothered
me
but
the
taste
was
awesome
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
ever
drank
even
people
who
dont
normally
like
stouts
will
enjoy
this
beer
goes
great
with
dinner
and
what
a
great
name
for
a
beer
hell
yea
holyoke
a
very
nice
dry
stout
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
like
so
many
u
s
micro
brewed
irish
dry
stouts
this
stuff
puts
guinness
to
shame
id
love
to
taste
this
from
a
nitro
tap
id
pick
this
over
guinness
or
other
similar
american
brewed
dry
stouts
a
pleasure
running
into
this
one
in
the
boston
area
the
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
black
or
brown
depending
on
your
eyesight
with
a
smallish
in
size
head
that
is
semicreamy
in
texture
and
the
color
a
light
chocolate
color
and
the
lace
left
behind
a
thin
curtain
to
drape
the
glass
nice
roasted
grain
and
coffee
nose
hints
of
caramel
malt
sweet
at
the
front
top
is
thickbodied
the
finish
has
a
meaningful
hop
spicy
bite
the
carbonation
is
leniently
acidic
the
aftertaste
malt
dry
and
long
lasting
quite
a
good
stout
actually
one
well
worth
the
dry
for
stout
lovers
m
had
been
raving
about
this
since
she
had
it
ontap
a
few
weeks
back
got
a
bottle
at
lunch
the
other
day
and
shared
it
good
chocolate
tastes
but
the
same
taste
just
didnt
carry
over
to
the
bottle
stick
with
the
draught
if
you
can
get
it
far
superior
mtmugsjun
25
pretty
decent
irish
stout
nice
uniqueness
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
its
pretty
distinct
that
said
the
body
disappoints
a
bit
and
its
ultimately
nothing
special
but
it
does
manage
a
robust
flavor
and
aroma
for
its
abv
which
is
impressive
ultimately
above
average
and
worth
a
try
for
a
nitro
this
beer
didnt
quite
have
the
creamy
head
or
cascading
effect
id
normally
expect
typcial
dark
brownblack
color
for
a
stout
small
bubbly
white
head
basic
aroma
of
dark
malts
and
a
touch
of
coffee
and
ash
similar
taste
dark
malts
moderate
roastiness
coffee
burny
ash
a
little
weak
but
not
too
bad
thinner
than
a
good
stout
should
be
about
medium
bodied
and
decently
drinkable
but
just
lacking
in
good
qualities
that
make
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
this
is
an
okay
stout
it
has
that
kind
of
sour
tone
that
some
stouts
can
get
decent
molasses
with
mild
roasted
tones
the
body
seems
a
bit
thin
and
the
flavor
profile
could
linger
a
bit
more
this
is
an
alright
stout
in
my
book
but
not
much
beyond
that
d
as
sessionable
of
a
stout
that
ive
ever
found
loaded
with
flavor
and
character
and
weighing
in
only
at
4

pours
a
dark
near
black
with
red
highlights
dense
khaki
colored
creamy
head
little
lacing
scent
is
roasty
with
faint
notes
of
powdered
cocoa
and
a
little
woody
spicy
note
nice
dry
and
lightly
bitter
roasty
quality
to
taste
faint
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
char
splash
of
fruity
and
herbaly
flavors
on
back
end
medium
bodied
dry
a
highly
drinkable
stout
but
lacking
in
any
standout
notes
deep
dark
black
look
to
it
and
a
nice
head
of
maybe
two
inches
that
came
up
and
over
the
top
with
some
ease
settling
down
it
left
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
sides
but
nothing
spectacular
though
it
did
retain
a
good
bit
of
the
puff
of
tan
on
top
the
aroma
was
nice
well
blended
mix
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
hints
of
light
coffee
notes
and
a
decent
bit
of
dark
fruit
note
carrying
over
this
was
pretty
much
par
for
the
course
with
the
flavor
started
out
very
smooth
with
a
rich
and
well
defined
chocolate
note
that
dominated
early
before
mellowing
with
a
nice
but
of
vanilla
and
coffee
notes
small
touch
of
hops
catching
up
right
there
at
the
end
ordered
this
after
finishing
the
barley
wine
at
the
brewpub
this
beer
was
dark
black
in
color
with
a
soapy
looking
tan
color
head
not
much
lacing
here
and
looked
a
little
weak
to
me
the
smell
was
of
coffee
grounds
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
there
but
mostly
gave
off
flavors
of
burnt
coffee
bitterness
and
some
malts
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
a
little
thin
in
my
opinion
overall
this
stout
isnt
bad
but
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
o
this
was
my
first
susquehanna
stout
and
i
enjoyed
it
the
roasted
malt
was
everywhere
only
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
did
it
get
to
be
too
much
the
chocolate
presence
was
nice
o
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
since
the
base
beer
is
one
of
the
only
beers
i
like
from
abc
but
i
just
cant
the
flavors
were
good
but
the
dead
look
and
watery
feel
ruined
it
d
overall
i
dont
find
this
to
be
terribly
drinkable
i
dont
really
care
for
that
espresso
flavor
and
i
feel
like
this
beer
has
a
touch
of
peppery
heat
that
i
find
to
be
unenjoyable
2
5
poured
very
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
that
died
rather
quickly
a
rather
subdued
nose
but
i
gather
a
bit
of
burnt
toast
biscuits
hint
of
floral
hops
and
coffee
the
flavor
is
like
the
nose
and
also
has
a
bit
of
charcoal
moderate
body
could
use
a
boost
carbonation
is
decently
smooth
a
very
meh
beer
imo
d
a
lot
like
a
guinness
which
is
good
for
me
because
i
started
my
beer
enthusiasm
with
the
st
johns
gate
brew
and
i
love
to
buy
local
so
i
would
almost
drive
to
the
abc
to
get
a
growler
of
this
before
i
got
guinness
however
if
i
found
something
a
little
closer
and
american
this
wouldnt
be
missed
very
drinkable
a
nice
offering
overall
this
was
a
very
good
stout
with
a
good
balance
of
roast
and
sweetness
well
worth
a
shot
overall
a
very
tasty
and
clean
dry
stout
i
like
this
stout
i
like
it
a
lot
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brownblack
color
with
excellent
tan
head
and
some
decent
lacing
nice
scent
some
burnt
grain
and
dark
malt
and
a
lot
of
chocolate
same
for
the
taste
a
nice
stout
with
a
huge
chocolate
flavor
goes
down
quite
smooth
i
wouldve
rated
it
higher
if
it
wouldve
actually
supposed
to
have
been
a
chocolate
stout
d
one
of
abcs
finest
especially
on
cask
this
is
a
very
good
stout
with
a
pleasant
roasty
character
d
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
session
beer
low
abv
d
his
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
ive
never
heard
of
before
its
worth
trying
sometime
if
you
can
get
some
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
actually
do
not
live
far
from
the
appalachian
brewing
company
i
would
love
to
try
this
straight
from
the
tap
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
that
was
very
good
a
robust
roasted
and
coffee
taste
with
an
awesome
mouthfeel
a
very
good
smooth
real
ale
d
goes
down
very
well
very
tasty
bee
and
seems
to
get
a
bit
stronger
after
the
first
half
of
the
glass
wouldnt
drink
more
than
2
though
very
flavorful
perhaps
a
bit
overcarbonated
definitely
dry
a
good
example
of
the
style
if
i
knew
where
to
procure
this
i
would
in
the
end
it
was
nice
little
brewpub
dark
roasted
session
beer
this
would
make
for
a
nice
choice
to
put
in
your
growler
d
a
sipping
beer
not
one
to
pound
but
light
on
the
alcohol
content
hard
to
drink
but
it
was
a
nice
beer
dinner
had
with
pomegrante
blueberry
chicken
flavor
is
some
brown
sugar
but
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
espresso
bean
roll
in
the
finish
is
roasty
and
again
grassy
hops
the
hops
linger
a
bit
no
hint
of
abv
anywhere
i
found
the
beer
to
be
an
easy
drinker
but
was
surprised
at
the
hop
dosage
a
nice
drinking
brew
that
i
could
have
had
more
of
if
it
wasnt
only
lunch
time
flavor
is
very
chocolaty
with
hints
of
hops
and
coffee
starts
with
an
initial
spicy
bitter
kick
of
hops
and
espresso
then
melds
into
rich
dark
chocolate
finishing
dry
and
slightly
spicy
d
the
low
carbonation
makes
it
easy
to
drink
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
not
on
nitro
the
taste
however
gets
a
bit
strong
after
one
and
i
dont
think
more
than
two
would
be
prudent
nevertheless
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
just
keep
missing
it
on
cask
d
not
really
one
of
my
favorites
from
abc
not
an
easy
drinker
the
cask
pour
is
deep
brown
nearly
black
with
a
thin
head
that
carries
a
carmel
color
there
are
several
things
going
on
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
mild
hints
of
toasted
almond
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
are
present
but
overall
this
is
a
little
thin
its
certainly
better
on
cask
than
the
draft
counterpart
and
my
favorite
in
the
current
abc
lineup
dgood
beer
good
representative
of
the
style
but
a
little
boring
mouthfeel
wise
it
was
very
silky
and
smooth
pretty
heavy
stout
pretty
drinkable
and
overall
very
excellent
with
my
surf
turf
n
forgive
my
terseness
as
this
was
written
from
2
week
old
notes
this
is
a
solid
beer
all
around
its
simple
and
to
the
point
and
having
it
on
cask
just
adds
to
the
drinkability
by
accenting
the
flavours
a
bit
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
slightly
less
than
medium
body
the
carbonation
is
ample
to
the
beer
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
the
beer
are
very
satisfying
and
long
lasting
this
is
what
i
wish
guiness
was
still
like
this
is
a
dam
good
beer
and
i
will
seek
it
out
again
d
a
good
sessioner
the
drier
flavor
is
pleasant
without
knocking
the
drinker
out
a
proud
beer
to
central
pa
the
susquehanna
stout
was
presently
wonderfully
as
a
cask
conditioned
ale
a
perfect
aperitif
to
a
meal
at
the
brewpub
in
harrisburg
pa
simply
an
amazing
beer
on
cask
warm
and
toasted
with
biscuity
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
grinds
filling
the
air
even
thicker
than
usual
sort
of
a
sludge
texture
but
no
matter
as
the
beer
more
than
makes
up
for
it
alcohol
well
hidden
though
this
isnt
exactly
strong
beer
anyway
one
complaint
could
be
the
lack
of
aftertaste
as
it
somehow
dissapeared
with
a
budweiser
select
style
of
cleaness
overall
though
very
satisfying
id
have
it
again
cheers
served
at
the
gettysburg
abc
in
a
logoed
pint
the
beer
has
a
beautiful
lasting
head
they
pour
well
here
ive
noticed
head
is
dark
tan
above
an
opaque
black
liquid
leaves
some
very
nice
lacing
smells
of
slight
sweet
and
bitter
roast
and
high
chocolate
tastes
very
rich
and
creamy
even
more
so
with
the
pulled
pork
moves
through
coffee
and
chocolate
to
a
bittersweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
which
lends
a
very
nice
smoothness
very
drinkable
so
long
as
you
dont
rush
it
i
was
unfortunately
in
a
hurry
to
leave
and
wasnt
fully
able
to
enjoy
the
last
bits
while
it
was
nothing
to
crow
about
i
did
enjoy
this
pint
it
has
a
basic
malty
stout
character
that
made
a
decent
name
for
itself
it
was
easy
on
the
abv
and
that
combined
with
the
crisp
finish
made
it
pleasantly
drinkable
it
might
not
be
something
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
down
but
id
not
hesitate
ordering
it
again
should
it
find
its
way
back
to
me
heres
a
solid
black
color
with
a
slight
chocolatecolored
head
the
beer
presents
a
fairly
intense
coffee
aroma
its
heavy
on
the
roasted
barley
with
a
mix
of
highly
roasted
and
burnt
grains
the
brew
is
pleasingly
dry
with
a
full
smoothness
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
toffee
flavors
smooth
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
with
moderately
low
carbonation
the
brew
seems
to
have
moderately
low
bitterness
and
a
nice
roasted
quality
in
the
finish
very
nice
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
but
dryness
tends
to
tire
the
tongue
definitely
good
for
a
pint
quite
drinkable
and
the
abv
makes
it
sessionable
a
solid
stout
this
was
another
obsidiancolored
bevvy
but
unlike
the
porter
this
had
almost
no
head
at
all
i
again
noted
the
charcoal
notes
that
i
often
detect
in
the
nose
of
both
porters
and
stouts
this
was
a
very
nice
dry
stout
and
most
interestingly
it
was
served
via
co2
vice
n2
this
meant
that
the
mouthfeel
was
less
creamy
that
what
i
would
normallly
expect
for
the
style
the
finish
left
me
with
a
lingering
taste
of
dark
chocolate
yummy
a
great
beer
to
finish
off
a
sampler
at
abc
a
good
solid
dry
irish
stout
with
a
nice
roasty
body
another
one
of
the
fine
abc
beers
id
have
again
pours
thick
and
densely
black
no
head
just
a
very
thin
ring
of
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aromas
of
chocolate
milk
toasted
malts
and
chocolate
covered
cherries
flavor
is
mild
but
enjoyable
kind
of
sweet
and
malty
i
would
think
this
would
go
more
into
the
sweet
stout
category
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
spritzy
for
such
a
thick
stout
however
this
is
certainly
one
i
could
drink
a
few
of
and
the
low
abv
and
mild
sweetness
would
make
this
a
great
breakfast
brew
abcs
stout
looks
great
it
is
almost
pure
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
and
loads
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
it
was
however
strangely
lacking
of
any
depth
in
the
aroma
there
was
hint
of
roasted
barley
but
thats
about
it
i
usually
expect
to
find
a
lot
more
smokiness
or
chocolate
or
caramel
undertones
these
were
lacking
the
taste
was
good
not
great
it
is
a
classic
irish
stout
as
opposed
to
an
american
imperial
or
chocolate
stout
that
doesnt
mean
it
should
have
less
flavor
but
this
one
is
a
little
light
on
taste
it
has
the
roasted
barley
taste
that
is
very
pleasant
but
little
else
it
was
also
thinner
in
the
mouth
than
most
stouts
i
liked
it
but
again
there
are
better
stouts
in
local
brewpubs
not
far
away
selins
grove
and
bullfrog
to
name
two
pours
a
a
deep
black
with
some
light
red
flashes
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
ofhints
of
cedar
in
the
aroma
with
some
roasted
malt
taste
is
highly
roasted
with
some
nutty
flavors
and
bittersweet
chocolate
a
nice
balance
of
earthiness
and
chocolate
a
appetizing
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
a
good
find
on
tap
drinkability
i
try
to
make
the
rounds
at
the
brewery
but
i
always
come
back
to
this
one
it
is
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
wont
pound
you
into
the
ground
served
as
part
of
a
sampler
tray
at
their
brewery
from
the
glass
this
beer
looked
midnight
black
with
a
very
rich
and
dark
tan
head
the
aroma
is
appealing
with
roasted
grains
and
some
bittersweet
chocolate
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
has
a
decent
malt
body
the
roasted
bitterness
is
just
about
perfect
in
this
beer
finishes
dry
i
enjoyed
this
stout
very
much
firm
black
thick
concoction
rich
hop
aroma
with
chocolate
malt
undertones
offwhite
head
slightly
less
creamy
than
should
be
nice
lace
rich
and
bitter
is
the
first
impression
slightly
sweet
and
creamy
mouthfeel
dark
and
roasted
tasted
like
dark
roasted
peanuts
a
little
dry
tasty
this
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
minimal
head
a
scant
ring
of
caramel
colored
lace
hugs
the
side
of
my
glass
at
surface
level
smells
like
strong
espresso
with
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
it
tastes
like
weak
coffee
though
not
very
malty
rather
thin
overall
flavor
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
if
you
like
tepid
coffee
you
will
love
this
beer
but
its
not
for
me
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
it
jarod
as
this
beer
is
poured
into
the
glass
you
notice
how
dark
and
robust
it
appears
the
head
is
full
and
a
rich
creamytan
color
its
lace
is
nice
as
it
glides
down
the
glass
it
smell
and
taste
are
of
a
classic
irish
dry
stout
the
aroma
has
notes
of
a
roasted
malt
coffee
barley
and
slight
hops
the
taste
is
creamy
and
smooth
the
flavors
that
come
out
are
roasted
coffeelight
chocolate
barley
malt
and
some
hops
this
is
a
ok
beer
that
tastes
better
as
the
temperature
rises
a
really
tasty
stout
roasty
and
robust
when
it
needs
to
be
but
refreshing
too
really
nice
overall
this
is
okay
but
a
bit
of
a
confusing
creation
its
categorized
as
an
irish
dry
stout
but
there
is
a
definite
spicy
character
to
it
that
just
doesnt
fit
if
they
have
indeed
used
irish
yeast
then
i
can
only
imagine
the
spicy
flavors
come
from
the
hop
additions
regardless
this
factor
makes
the
brew
more
belgian
in
style
which
is
interesting
but
not
necessarily
to
style
a
decent
effort
and
an
enjoyable
beer
but
a
bit
of
an
oddity
thanks
again
guys
oa
rather
assertive
dry
stout
i
enjoyed
it
but
fear
i
will
remember
the
artwork
far
longer
than
the
actual
beer
of
all
of
the
québec
microbrasserie
stouts
this
is
my
favorite
it
has
a
dry
punchy
taste
to
start
off
with
and
offers
cacao
and
coffee
flavours
with
a
hopsy
spice
to
it
the
feel
is
creamy
and
it
isnt
too
sweet
but
not
too
bitter
either
the
aftertaste
seems
to
be
indecisive
in
the
sense
that
it
borders
on
bitter
while
leaving
a
little
sweetness
in
a
nutshell
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
québec
micro
brewery
stouts
and
the
boys
in
shawinigan
are
on
to
something
with
this
little
pearl
it
goes
down
great
on
its
own
but
also
accompanies
strong
cheeses
very
well
prost

600

bottle
featuring
cool
artwork
depicting
a
kraken
battling
a
bunch
of
dudes
with
axes
and
such
name
refers
to
blood
brew
is
a
rich
jet
black
with
a
burnt
orange
halo
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
ample
brown
head
and
smells
great
prominent
roasted
malt
spice
seed
like
anise
along
with
a
soft
fruity
top
note
and
a
whiff
of
leafy
hops
taste
is
light
roast
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
dried
fruit
like
raisins
and
dates
a
touch
of
smoke
some
herbal
hop
notes
which
combine
with
other
flavors
to
create
a
licorice
root
effect
i
also
detect
a
bright
acidity
reminiscent
of
red
wine
and
although
the
finish
is
quite
dry
as
per
the
style
with
some
toast
and
bitter
husk
there
is
a
lingering
sweetness
as
well
and
this
is
a
very
wellcrafted
dry
irish
stout
that
incorporates
more
noticeable
sweet
fruit
and
herb
flavors
than
is
generally
the
case
medium
body
which
belies
the
opaque
demonic
appearance
youd
think
it
would
be
thicker
with
dryish
mouth
feel
its
a
little
buttery
and
sweet
yet
highly
carbonated
neat
take
on
the
style
stronger
and
more
complex
than
usual
an
american
stoutdry
irish
hybrid
overall
this
strangely
works
the
strong
coffee
bitterness
youd
expect
is
reserved
for
the
finish
while
the
rest
of
the
flavor
plays
with
citrus
grapefruit
and
herbal
hops
settling
into
a
chocolatey
roasty
tho
not
over
the
top
tasty
drink
short
of
amazing
but
i
would
have
it
again
without
hesitation
as
a
flavourful
session
stout
on
a
cool
night
4
o
not
a
bad
beer
a
nice
dry
stout
i
quite
like
the
roasty
malt
flavor
and
though
there
is
a
slight
bitter
finish
i
think
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
3
75
d
this
a
good
tasting
stout
with
an
outstanding
appearance
glad
to
see
this
available
in
ontario
although
a
french
producer
this
beer
is
one
from
straight
out
a
british
pub
ive
always
considered
dry
stouts
to
be
the
old
reliable
of
beer
styles
and
le
trou
du
diable
sangdencre
is
as
solid
as
any
of
them
it
is
substantial
and
satiating
without
being
too
heavy
or
rich
one
bottle
was
mighty
satisfying
though
i
like
the
idea
of
having
two
or
three
more
hope
it
ages
well
as
i
believe
im
about
to
buy
many
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
pretty
solid
stuff
as
are
most
of
the
beers
from
this
brewer
price
point
might
keep
me
away
when
6
packs
of
st
ambroise
stouts
are
7
99
at
the
same
store
but
it
was
worth
a
try
i
poured
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
wow
lots
of
foam
it
died
down
leaving
some
tan
lace
on
the
glass
and
a
hint
of
foam
on
the
top
good
dark
color
i
couldnt
smell
anything
the
taste
was
good
roast
malt
chocolate
coffee
maybe
a
little
strong
for
an
irish
stout
more
like
an
imperial
stout
but
good
o
a
pretty
good
beer
it
was
nice
to
sip
on
a
stout
a
mist
my
summer
craze
of
ipas
and
low
abv
belgians
worth
a
try
but
a
i
doubt
ill
be
a
repeat
customer
with
other
ltdd
brews
beside
it
on
the
shelf
that
i
preferred
for
the
same
price
not
really
a
traditional
interpretation
of
an
irish
dry
stout
but
this
is
good
all
the
same
roasted
sure
but
with
those
spice
and
coffee
adjuncts
which
make
for
a
more
complex
and
interesting
affair
all
around
im
hardly
worried
about
any
inherent
sickness
i
might
have
for
these
increasingly
interesting
quebecois
offerings
not
bad
it
didnt
produce
oos
or
ahhs
but
for
the
style
it
seemed
about
par
i
think
it
would
be
good
out
of
a
nitro
tap
since
the
head
was
the
main
issue
for
me
would
have
again
overall
nothing
fancy
here
but
a
well
made
beer
seems
a
little
thin
but
that
my
only
real
complaint
deep
brown
colour
over
a
finger
of
thick
off
white
head
some
lace
as
well
smell
is
roasted
and
chocolatey
some
coffee
clean
in
the
nose
taste
roasted
and
dry
coffee
and
a
little
astringent
as
well
bit
of
hop
and
a
nice
mixture
of
coffee
and
hop
bitterness
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
lightly
carbonated
and
creamy
bit
of
a
light
feel
but
quite
smooth
nothing
groundbreaking
but
a
simple
and
effective
dry
stout
overall
a
straight
forward
but
nice
stout
draft
poured
a
black
color
ale
with
a
nice
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
roasted
malt
with
nice
aromatic
coffee
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
malt
roasted
notes
with
some
aromatic
coffee
which
is
surprising
considering
there
is
no
coffee
in
here
and
those
roasted
malt
do
make
a
wonder
body
is
about
average
for
style
with
ok
carbonation
very
well
brewed
for
style

this

this
seems
to
be
a
better
version
of
and
irish
dry
stout
than
guinness
but
nothing
too
exciting
was
a
bit
expensive
for
the
half
pint
so
likely
wouldnt
order
again
at
the

with

what

could
be
better
about
this
beer
its
perfect
6
awards
and
it
deserves
every
one
of
them
overall
this
is
definitely
pretty
good
but
also
definitely
has
some
room
for
improvement
might
be
that
i
just
prefer
my
dark
beers
to
be
on
the
sweeter
side
like
the
snowblind
doppelbock
from
the
same
variety
packholy
crap
that
one
was
good
if
you
like
your
dark
beers
dry
and
roasty
rather
than
sweet
and
sticky
id
give
it
a
try
o
i
actually
didnt
think
it
was
that
bad
my
wife
said
it
tasted
like
a
fire
pit
but
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
smoke
pretty
average
beautiful
dark
chocolate
brown
color
that
just
doesnt
want
to
let
the
light
through
ok
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
malty
with
roasted
coffee
flavors
coming
through
taste
is
awesome
very
clean
and
a
crisp
finish
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
blend
and
balance
well
together
easily
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
and
a
very
clean
and
crisp
finish
gotta
have
some
more
ofthese
o
very
nice
beer
hold
true
to
the
stout
just
not
as
developed
and
strong
as
i
might
like
i
like
my
stout
like
arnold
and
this
is
kinda
like
rich
froning
still
got
muscles
and
knows
how
to
use
them
but
arnold
is
still
bigger
and
sexier
oits
a
great
beer
nothing
to
call
home
about
but
it
is
well
executed
after
i
try
a
few
more
i
will
form
my
final
opinion
best
beer
of
the
day
o
a
great
converter
for
the
guiness
drinker
nothing
worth
getting
too
excited
about
i
wonder
if
there
are
nitro
kegs
out
there
aroma
was
strong
upfront
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
seemed
a
bit
weak
the
first
few
swallows
thankfully
the
beer
settled
down
and
became
quite
pleasing
to
drink
i
had
to
knock
a
couple
of
categories
up
a
notch
definitely
worth
trying
again
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
stout
great
dark
smells
and
flavors
and
wonderful
full
bodied
appearance
o
not
a
bad
stout
an
average
and
i
wouldnt
mind
another
o
its
a
decent
stout
with
a
moderately
complex
flavor
not
stunning
but
not
lacking
either
dark
pour
to
this
with
not
a
lot
of
head
and
practically
no
lacing
to
be
seen
once
i
worked
my
way
through
this
the
appearance
was
that
of
flat
soda
but
there
was
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
that
could
be
detected
here
lots
of
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
and
espresso
tossed
in
for
good
measure
and
just
a
hint
of
sodalike
stickiness
all
of
the
flavors
faded
quickly
and
just
a
hint
of
the
bubbles
stuck
around
in
the
aftertaste
making
this
feel
more
watery
than
it
already
was
3
45
o
easily
sessionable
but
still
has
a
good
body
and
flavor
nice
coffee
tones
and
malting
poured
from
a
growler
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
pitch
black
with
a
large
fluffy
light
brown
head
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
but
not
strong
tastes
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
slight
coffee
finish
for
this
light
bodied
beer
is
very
smooth
carbonation
is
proper
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
out
of
the
bottle
it
is
opaque
black
a
thick
tan
head
forms
and
leaves
heavy
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
even
after
the
head
dissipates
with
a
few
sips
a
froth
remains
on
the
surface
there
is
little
to
distinguish
the
aroma
of
this
beer
its
just
faint
toasted
malt
it
carries
nice
toasted
malt
onto
the
palate
backed
up
with
some
assertive
hops
and
some
serious
effervescence
for
a
stout
which
adds
a
lively
mouthfeel
and
nice
drinkability
this
is
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
that
would
be
a
very
good
session
stout
as
an
alternative
to
guinness
this
is
a
fine
beer
its
nothing
remarkable
but
it
is
satisfying
and
enjoyable
im
grateful
to
my
friend
who
brought
it
back
from
the
dc
area
for
me
but
i
dont
see
myself
trying
to
trade
for
another
bottle
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
a
good
bit
of
roasted
malts
in
the
taste
as
well
some
coffee
a
bit
of
smokiness
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
middle
of
the
road
stout
here
not
bad
but
nothing
special
it
is
definitely
okay
for
only
being
4
2
abv
but
its
not
the
first
thing
i
would
reach
for
this
is
a
very
averageatbest
stout
by
todays
standards
i
would
say
below
average
overall
all
this
beer
is
average
not
bad
but
not
the
first
thing
i
would
reach
for
overall
a
decent
light
stout
but
nothing
that
is
really
all
that
fantastic
it
is
sort
of
a
sweet
version
of
guinness
draught
without
the
nitro
if
looking
for
a
low
alcohol
stout
would
take
a
guinness
over
this
this
one
pours
a
deep
opaque
cola
brown
with
a
modest
fizzy
but
lasting
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
fragrant
combination
of
coffee
with
milk
some
nutty
roasted
malt
and
a
small
hint
of
chocolate
the
flavor
features
more
of
the
same
prototypical
stout
characteristics
with
a
really
nice
dry
roasty
malt
profile
the
medium
body
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
flavors
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
by
providing
a
decent
depth
of
flavor
without
feeling
heavy
overall
the
beer
is
decent
for
the
style
highly
drinkable
but
it
appears
this
one
sacrifices
some
flavoring
for
drinkability
typical
of
most
irish
stouts
this
is
a
very
robust
stout
to
be
an
irish
dry
stout
it
drinks
more
like
an
american
stout
it
has
big
roasty
notes
throughout
its
highly
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
its
worth
a
try
but
youll
be
disappointed
if
youre
looking
for
a
guinnesstype
stout
i
love
stout
and
starr
hill
dark
starr
stout
is
certainly
not
a
bad
stout
but
it
isnt
as
rich
and
flavorful
as
i
expected
it
seems
like
a
good
session
stout
and
a
nice
option
for
beginners
but
i
found
it
somewhat
of
a
letdown
based
on
initial
appearance
it
seems
like
it
is
going
to
be
something
much
greater
but
it
is
still
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
is
certainly
deserving
of
a
taste
o
i
will
say
this
this
would
make
a
great
summer
around
the
pool
stout
not
many
i
would
say
that
about
overall
not
the
finest
representation
of
an
irish
dry
stout
ive
ever
had
but
its
a
decent
take
on
the
style
3
the
beer
had
a
lighter
feel
to
it
which
is
typical
for
the
style
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
had
low
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
attempt
at
the
style
but
i
would
still
prefer
a
beamish
or
even
a
murphys
the
palate
is
where
this
suffers
imo
the
roasted
barley
bitterness
is
a
little
too
high
in
the
mix
making
this
grainy
acidic
and
almost
burnt
with
stale
coffee
none
of
the
sweetness
of
the
nose
is
present
here
exacerbating
the
onedimensional
nature
of
this
beer
some
hop
bitterness
is
perceived
as
well
especially
on
the
finish
while
i
know
that
dry
stouts
are
by
definition
dry
they
neednt
be
watery
which
this
one
is
moderately
carbonated
this
beer
is
too
watery
for
its
own
good
i
cant
recommend
it
but
if
it
were
cold
and
it
were
a
hot
day
out
i
might
pound
a
couple
pours
jet
black
with
a
nice
slightly
tan
frothy
head
roasty
smell
to
it
taste
is
medium
bodied
some
nice
roasted
malts
come
through
with
a
decent
hop
presence
as
well
taste
finishes
a
bit
dry
but
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
not
my
favorite
of
styles
but
its
a
notch
above
a
guinness
thats
for
sure
overall
impression
a
light
black
ale
at
most
missed
the
mark
for
a
stout
even
a
dry
version
wish
there
was
more
body
and
character
however
i
did
go
after
this
beer
because
of
its
label
i
will
most
definitely
be
keeping
it
for
a
souvenir
m
low
carb
dry
thin
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
really
liked
this
flavorful
interpretation
overall
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
really
noteworthy
easy
to
drink
and
could
easily
drink
again
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
quite
bitter
on
the
end
leaving
an
aftertaste
of
ash
and
roasted
coffee
some
nuts
forward
minimal
sweetness
and
a
light
yeastiness
biscuit
feeling
it
was
fine
an
irish
dry
stout
is
not
a
style
i
care
much
for
but
overall
i
think
starr
hill
did
a
good
job
on
this
interpretation
my
pour
resulted
in
two
fingers
of
deepbrown
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
ruby
highlights
and
allowing
light
to
penetrate
only
at
the
edges
nose
had
a
rich
chocolatiness
to
accompany
the
roastiness
of
the
malt
my
mouth
was
watering
by
the
time
i
took
my
first
sip
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
unexpected
smokiness
initially
followed
by
a
black
coffee
bitterness
ending
with
a
wash
of
dark
chocolate
wow
finish
was
dry
a
little
smoky
and
quite
bitter
i
really
dig
this
sort
of
thing
but
i
may
not
be
for
everyone
once
more
worth
a
try
o
i
found
the
dark
starr
stout
to
be
a
very
well
done
take
on
an
irish
dry
stout
its
tastier
than
guinness
at
least
the
stuff
you
can
get
in
the
us
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
it
in
ireland
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
by
the
way
ive
had
this
in
the
bottle
before
and
would
highly
recommend
having
it
on
draftgrowler
its
a
beer
that
is
best
fresh
overall
youll
get
more
flavor
from
a
dayold
guinness
i
recommend
trying
others
o
the
bottle
is
a
month
and
a
half
past
its
date
but
i
usually
assume
a
stout
will
hold
out
longer
than
advertised
so
i
decided
to
review
it
is
that
the
cause
of
the
metallic
taste
i
dont
know
this
beer
has
enough
reviews
that
mine
wont
shift
the
grade
and
i
feel
others
may
feel
the
same
way
about
dates
on
stouts
so
i
think
this
could
be
useful
information
i
will
revisit
a
fresher
bottle
and
change
accordingly
if
needed
o
a
pretty
decent
stout
much
better
than
the
one
iteration
of
guinness
that
i
had
i
see
that
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
lighter
in
body
personally
i
like
a
stout
to
be
thick
maybe
the
irish
style
isnt
for
me
but
this
is
decent
overall
an
average
stout
little
thin
and
the
sour
after
taste
does
not
fit
this
beer
o
a
decent
irish
stout
despite
the
nose
nearly
on
par
with
guinness
but
certainly
not
up
with
the
best
versions
of
this
style
d
the
name
on
this
beer
made
me
really
want
to
love
this
just
like
a
69
dark
star
however
i
was
left
a
little
disappointed
with
the
taste
as
everything
seemed
very
subtle
and
somewhat
watery
either
way
enjoyable
just
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
but
not
quite
with
very
little
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
beer
is
pours
very
thin
and
is
not
as
thick
as
most
stouts
with
that
said
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
and
would
definately
try
again
the
beer
is
not
especially
dark
brown
hued
with
a
thin
cap
that
leaves
faint
traces
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
primarily
of
roast
and
is
subdued
the
flavor
is
very
roasty
with
a
subtle
chocolate
and
smoke
presence
the
feel
is
thin
and
watery
with
low
carbonation
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
but
i
would
be
willing
to
try
this
again
overall
an
ok
brew
o
this
beer
for
a
stout
is
watered
down
and
light
a
more
porter
style
than
anything
else
alcohol
is
light
meaning
more
than
one
is
very
doable
a
nice
stab
at
the
style
but
i
would
label
this
as
a
porter
and
i
think
the
overall
reviews
would
be
better
o
nice
but
not
enough
going
on
3
5
o
again
maybe
it
is
just
that
this
one
needs
to
be
on
tap
or
fresh
i
would
encourage
anyone
who
gave
this
beer
poor
marks
to
try
one
again
if
ever
in
the
central
va
area
overall
a
good
stout
with
one
of
the
best
roasted
malt
flavors
i
have
ever
experienced
without
being
overly
heavy
pours
black
topped
with
a
thin
but
creamy
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
very
little
lace
the
nose
on
this
one
is
not
good
faint
roasted
malts
faint
chocolate
but
pretty
bland
and
something
is
off
here
the
taste
confirms
my
suspicions
faded
chocolate
turning
sour
off
flavors
for
sure
medium
body
with
very
little
carbonation
not
good
could
be
bad
bottle
but
a
drainpour
none
the
less
o
mediocre
per
style
it
has
some
good
qualities
but
it
also
has
some
off
qualities
i
would
like
to
visit
this
again
on
tap
or
something
and
see
if
i
get
a
different
opinion
overall
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
was
expecting
something
different
and
it
just
wasnt
here
as
far
as
being
drinkable
it
was
thats
about
it
though
i
coupled
this
beer
with
my
steak
dinner
and
it
went
damn
near
perfect
with
it
i
would
definitely
have
another
in
the
same
situation
and
i
would
probably
enjoy
one
as
an
unwind
type
of
beer
my
overall
impression
of
the
beer
might
be
inflated
by
the
fact
that
i
had
a
great
evening
but
the
beer
might
have
also
added
to
that
great
evening
catch
22
d
pretty
alright
but
not
very
much
happening
here
overall
an
ok
brew
but
not
much
to
offer
for
a
stout
a
little
light
in
body
and
flavor
for
my
liking
d
its
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
grab
for
this
one
the
body
seems
to
be
lacking
though
i
had
the
dark
starr
stout
poured
into
snifter
glass
the
appearance
was
black
with
a
light
brown
head
there
was
a
strong
coffee
smell
which
i
always
love
it
has
a
solid
clean
crisp
taste
that
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
overall
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
with
this
beer
is
bold
it
is
not
particularly
complex
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
it
has
an
overpowering
coffeeflavored
nose
and
a
fullon
bitter
taste
this
beer
is
not
the
beer
to
use
as
an
introduction
to
craft
beer
or
to
stouts
but
for
the
seasoned
veteran
who
is
looking
for
a
solid
beer
with
a
bite
this
is
it
brought
back
from
north
carolina
from
a
friend
pours
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
soft
tan
head
and
a
nice
trail
of
spotty
lacing
there
is
not
much
on
the
nose
roasted
malt
faint
chocolate
and
maybe
some
coffee
faint
flavor
characteristics
as
well
chocolate
light
vanilla
caramel
and
some
coffeelike
nuttiness
in
the
aftertaste
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
easy
and
satisfying
to
drink
but
there
is
a
metallic
taste
not
sure
if
its
the
hops
or
just
the
style
of
stout
not
a
bad
dry
stout
but
this
wont
be
one
i
look
for
again
if
youre
going
to
try
a
starr
hill
brew
go
with
the
jomo
excellent
session
wanted
to
really
like
this
beer
as
it
is
brewed
in
crozet
va
where
i
used
to
run
with
rescue
squad
western
albemarle
back
in
the
college
days
at
uva
these
are
somewhat
drinkable
but
the
lack
of
prominent
flavor
makes
you
want
to
venture
to
other
darker
beers
after
one
of
these
i
cant
imagine
wanting
to
stick
with
them
id
leave
it
in
pursuit
of
a
thicker
and
tastier
stout
cheers
did
not
enjoy
this
at
all
with
so
many
truly
great
stouts
out
there
i
would
not
even
think
about
drinking
another
one
of
these
i
liked
the
label
being
a
deadhead
and
all
and
that
its
virginia
brewery
wanted
to
try
this
during
our
summer
tour
of
the
virginianorth
carolina
region
so
my
wife
and
i
gave
it
a
shot
poured
out
nice
with
a
dense
tan
head
not
bad
considering
it
should
have
a
low
abv
as
consitent
with
the
style
aroma
was
roasty
with
some
dark
chocolate
overtones
taste
was
frankly
disappointing
very
tart
upfront
and
not
much
else
going
on
in
the
finish
to
smooth
that
out
mouthfeel
was
rather
thin
and
the
sourness
made
me
not
want
to
continue
drinking
multiple
rounds
i
would
try
this
again
on
tap
at
the
brewery
but
i
wont
be
actively
seeking
this
one
out
in
any
other
parts
of
the
states
d
this
was
a
decent
beer
it
wasnt
the
best
stout
ive
ever
tasted
however
it
did
the
job
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
a
solid
good
dark
stout
but
nothing
that
makes
you
or
me
want
to
go
out
and
get
one
deh
it
goes
down
easily
but
its
not
something
ill
be
getting
again
the
taste
stays
fairly
well
i
think
ill
be
giving
the
5
other
bottles
to
other
people
nice
lookin
stout
full
of
off
white
head
pitch
black
nice
lacing
couldnt
ask
for
more
smells
good
too
chocolatey
coffee
notes
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
has
a
real
balanced
taste
nutty
at
first
slight
bitterness
classic
roasted
malty
flavour
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
make
their
way
through
just
slightly
has
a
bit
of
a
chalky
and
dry
mouthfeel
nice
full
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
recommended
easy
drinking
stout
that
is
fully
balanced
in
my
opinion
good
about
what
i
was
expecting
this
is
one
of
the
best
things
to
come
out
of
crozet
since
the
2003
western
albemarle
hs
football
season
for
the
abv
not
overly
drinkable
those
numbers
you
would
think
it
was
a
session
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
overall
overall
the
beer
was
ok
not
much
in
the
flavor
department
i
was
a
little
disapointed
because
i
usually
enjoy
starr
hill
beers
overall
drinkability
is
good
and
this
is
a
better
than
average
irish
dry
stout
im
somewhat
impressed
taste
is
a
bit
watery
but
crisp
and
sharp
its
fairly
smokey
and
sharp
very
creamy
and
nice
mouthfeel
is
really
light
and
smooth
d
lack
of
sweetness
decent
hopping
low
abv
drinkable
d
excellent
flavor
is
pleasing
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
or
overstay
its
welcome
recommended
nothing
extraordinairy
but
i
thought
this
beer
otherwise
nice
enough
not
sure
its
something
id
ever
want
to
order
again
though
pours
black
as
night
with
a
creamy
brown
head
with
excellent
retention
aromas
are
predominantly
roasty
but
also
has
a
good
amount
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
faint
whiff
of
scorched
earth
i
like
it
just
as
i
like
the
flavors
which
follow
the
nose
and
then
some
adding
espresso
flavors
this
is
perhaps
the
driest
dry
stout
ive
had
better
than
most
of
the
popular
massproduced
irish
stouts
out
there
body
is
a
bit
more
watery
than
id
like
but
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
d
easily
drinkable
could
go
for
a
little
more
flavor
and
heftier
feel
great
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
good
easily
drinkable
and
sessionable
stout
not
the
best
out
there
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
it
finishes
pretty
dry
but
no
drier
than
it
started
it
has
a
mouth
smacking
dry
and
sticky
quality
though
a
little
bit
more
of
that
fruit
from
the
yeast
coming
out
with
a
slight
lingering
malty
quality
most
of
the
dark
malts
are
gone
now
no
roast
or
chocolate
but
a
little
bitterness
coming
from
a
slight
bit
of
the
roasted
malt
and
some
more
from
some
hidden
spicy
and
grassy
hops
bottle
received
as
an
extra
pours
a
deep
brown
black
color
into
my
kentucky
breakfast
stout
glass
nice
1
finger
tan
head
the
color
of
mocha
the
nose
is
rather
subtle
for
me
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
very
smooth
taste
with
a
bitterness
in
the
end
notes
of
coffee
abound
dry
finish
lighter
mouthfeel
than
i
would
have
expected
i
dont
really
understand
his
stout
sweet
and
effervescent
but
not
creamy
wtf
d
drinkable
yes
as
in
you
could
consume
large
quantities
of
it
without
being
too
full
or
drunk
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
to
be
honest
drinks
easy
delivers
plenty
of
flavor
for
the
abv
nice
take
on
the
style
d
not
a
go
to
style
for
me
i
was
done
with
this
before
my
glass
was
empty
this
was
the
first
real
local
brew
i
had
when
i
moved
here
to
the
commonwealth
nows
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
have
it
again
it
pours
an
opaque
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
thick
tan
foam
that
unfortunately
dies
away
pretty
quickly
the
nose
is
kinda
faint
comprising
some
dark
wheat
and
light
coffee
its
not
a
bad
smell
just
a
weak
one
the
taste
holds
notes
of
roasted
malts
burnt
wheat
coffee
and
a
hint
of
mild
sulfuric
sour
i
know
that
may
sound
pretty
damn
bad
but
its
like
a
more
badmilky
version
of
the
guinness
sour
as
though
sh
tried
to
mimic
the
classic
flavor
and
kinda
failed
the
body
is
kinda
light
with
a
fairly
high
bite
of
carbonation
and
sonewhat
watery
feel
overall
i
assume
this
was
meant
as
a
nice
light
sessionable
irish
stout
but
it
comes
off
as
too
light
and
cant
quite
nail
the
irish
qualities
it
aspires
to
its
still
not
bad
per
se
but
definitely
not
all
that
good
either
ive
had
this
a
couple
times
now
and
its
nice
to
have
another
irish
stout
around
but
im
turned
off
by
it
being
thick
for
the
style
really
it
comes
off
like
an
english
stout
to
me
but
styles
aside
this
is
a
tasty
beer
theres
a
tall
tan
head
over
the
pitch
black
body
the
aroma
was
heavy
with
roasted
grain
and
coffee
bean
notes
while
the
flavored
followed
those
same
characteristics
but
added
a
bitter
bakers
chocolate
flavor
definitiely
check
this
out
if
you
dig
stouts
of
any
kind
i
was
disappointed
to
find
out
its
a
stout
would
make
a
killer
black
ale
mouthfeel
suffers
point
loss
for
not
being
a
good
stout
good
beer
wrong
labeling
thats
all
im
saying
d
wont
seek
this
out
again
and
i
hope
the
rest
of
the
breweries
selections
are
better
really
loses
you
in
the
mouthfeel
d
a
pretty
good
beer
i
wish
that
i
could
get
these
in
ct
this
brew
from
starr
hill
was
mediocre
all
around
on
the
pour
the
color
was
typical
of
a
stout
completely
opaque
dark
black
retained
head
well
but
the
nose
was
a
bit
drab
coffee
and
bitter
hops
mostly
maybe
some
caramel
in
there
the
taste
was
almost
exactly
the
nose
not
much
but
coffee
and
bitterness
associated
with
the
stout
style
ales
and
towards
the
end
it
seemed
almost
like
the
coffee
had
staled
or
been
burnt
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
light
for
a
stout
at
least
for
me
too
carbonated
and
too
light
seem
to
go
badly
for
this
stout
all
around
a
typical
stout
without
much
character
and
perhaps
could
stand
some
more
aroma
and
a
little
thicker
brew
certainly
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
but
i
wont
be
needing
this
again
not
a
big
fan
no
need
to
revisit
this
one
just
a
run
of
the
mill
albeit
below
average
boring
stout
honestly
before
reading
the
profile
i
thought
this
was
an
american
stout
i
thought
the
hop
profile
was
very
assertive
the
beer
ended
more
bitter
than
i
expect
a
stout
to
the
sour
milk
character
brought
me
around
but
the
roastiness
is
still
a
little
more
than
i
need
im
happy
to
finish
the
6er
i
bought
but
not
in
one
sitting
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
lighter
in
body
like
a
canned
guinnessrelatively
smooth
some
dryness
in
the
finish
the
cigarette
ash
note
fortunately
fades
pretty
quickly
i
suspect
it
is
a
combo
of
overroastedburnt
malt
and
smoke
combining
less
than
favorably
the
molasses
note
might
also
be
at
play
here
otherwise
quite
good
flavorwise
but
weak
in
the
body
aspect
effervescence
is
very
light
and
all
the
aftertaste
is
in
the
back
of
the
palate
a
very
slight
warming
is
present
as
well
pours
an
opaque
oily
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
strong
and
spicy
with
a
firm
undertone
of
molasses
and
a
hint
of
miso
flavor
is
smoky
with
tones
of
coffee
and
molasses
and
just
a
trace
of
hoppy
bitterness
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
tingly
poured
a
very
nice
deep
deep
brown
with
some
decent
head
and
lacing
semideep
aroma
with
some
decent
roasted
grain
attributes
but
not
much
else
to
make
it
deeper
nice
taste
some
decent
roasted
grains
but
it
had
a
very
sweet
almost
lactose
taste
to
it
at
the
end
which
also
may
account
for
the
lighter
aroma
goes
down
well
d
nice
to
try
average
stout
d
this
wasnt
a
bad
stout
the
low
abv
and
lighter
mouthfeel
lead
to
nice
session
beer
let
this
one
warm
up
a
little
as
the
flavors
came
out
more
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
d
its
an
okay
session
stout
but
borders
on
the
bitter
side
this
is
my
first
beer
from
the
state
of
virginia
pours
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
faint
with
some
dark
malts
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
is
bitter
malts
with
some
chocolate
lightmedium
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
little
roasty
for
a
dry
stout
but
pretty
drinkable
well
i
expected
a
bigger
beer
with
lots
of
coffee
and
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
fact
this
was
something
i
was
looking
forward
to
since
it
was
the
closing
of
out
tasting
session
today
and
we
save
the
darker
beers
for
last
keep
in
mind
i
dont
like
big
stouts
but
since
ten
fidy
i
have
kept
an
open
mind
aroma
was
coffee
this
sorta
got
my
lips
wet
as
for
taste
wow
smokey
i
feel
like
a
chain
smoker
just
exhaled
a
pack
of
305s
in
my
mouth
though
it
calms
down
it
was
a
bit
too
smoky
for
my
taste
good
beer
if
you
like
stouts
but
i
dont
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
a
bit
offputting
this
beer
looks
and
smells
pretty
good
but
otherwise
is
average
at
best
overall
its
decent
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
d
it
is
not
my
favorite
but
i
do
love
looking
at
the
bottle
overall
it
was
ok
nothing
really
great
maybe
it
was
me
but
it
just
falls
in
line
with
a
bunch
of
other
average
stouts
very
easy
to
drink
once
again
style
considered
i
personally
wouldnt
want
another
right
after
but
i
could
see
fans
of
the
style
order
two
or
three
in
a
night
buy
again
yes
but
there
are
better
stouts
bottle
pours
a
dark
mahogany
body
with
a
tall
khaki
head
retention
is
good
and
lacing
generously
coats
the
side
of
the
duckrabbit
pint
glass
weak
aroma
has
hints
of
cocoa
and
dark
fruits
light
medium
body
is
moderately
carbonated
the
taste
has
some
dark
roasty
bitterness
that
contains
elements
of
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
powdered
cocoa
is
the
dominant
flavor
and
is
joined
by
faint
notes
of
nuttiness
and
dark
fruits
dark
roasty
finish
pleasantly
drinkable
if
not
very
memorable
thankfully
dark
starr
stout
packs
more
flavor
than
the
aroma
suggested
as
black
patent
chocolate
malts
add
a
roasted
bitterness
to
the
palate
dry
cocoa
and
soil
on
the
finish
a
little
lighter
in
body
that
i
would
like
for
an
irish
stout
but
the
tight
carbonation
is
ontarget
and
adds
a
subtle
creaminess
that
pairs
nicely
with
the
bitter
roastedness
of
the
finish
good
not
great
although
in
its
defense
this
was
a
beer
nearing
the
end
of
its
shelf
life
still
a
tasty
irish
stout
to
have
within
arms
reach
on
a
cold
night
in
the
west
virginia
hills
this
one
was
a
bit
much
for
me
hard
to
drink
poured
to
a
black
color
with
a
good
tan
head
nose
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
at
first
sip
is
like
a
black
olive
but
as
you
continue
to
drink
coffee
chocolate
and
nuts
are
the
stars
of
the
show
along
with
that
unmistakable
alcoholic
flavor
very
good
when
it
is
cold
but
when
it
starts
getting
warm
well
well
just
say
not
very
appetizing
d
good
can
have
more
than
one
as
long
a
s
you
dont
get
bored
with
it
note
looked
up
the
dark
starr
website
and
see
it
has
won
a
ton
of
awards
maybe
i
didnt
give
it
enough
credit
but
it
was
bang
on
for
the
style
medium
light
body
very
thin
could
have
used
so
thicking
very
drinkable
a
good
gateway
stout
this
is
a
safe
but
good
stout
while
its
complex
its
not
really
original
by
any
means
if
that
makes
any
sense
like
hints
of
a
lot
but
deliverance
of
a
little
i
plan
to
create
a
more
detaied
review
in
the
future
pending
my
next
opportunity
the
glass
is
a
quick
drink
and
a
second
would
be
easy
to
do
i
really
like
this
beer
fantastic
complexity
but
i
think
it
has
a
little
too
much
carbonation
that
prickles
the
tongue
a
bit
more
creaminess
without
being
a
cream
stout
would
go
a
long
way
on
a
nice
cold
day
this
is
definitely
a
go
to
beer
d
a
nice
dry
stout
the
malt
is
suitably
acidic
and
not
too
complex
with
perhaps
a
touch
more
caramel
depth
and
less
acidic
roast
character
than
more
traditional
examples
of
the
style
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
it
is
a
nice
interpretation
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
more
drinkability
just
an
avergae
stout
was
not
horrible
by
any
means
i
still
would
drink
it
again
but
nothin
to
go
crazy
about
the
taste
is
slightly
sweeter
with
some
sweeter
notes
in
teh
chocolate
but
not
a
lot
i
get
a
bit
more
of
the
coffee
as
well
this
is
the
first
irish
dry
stout
i
have
had
that
was
actually
dry
very
good
beer
i
liked
it
a
lot
its
a
little
thin
on
the
mouth
feel
and
i
could
use
a
little
less
of
the
coffee
notes
but
still
excellent
beer
drinkability
if
you
like
coffee
youll
love
this
beer
its
pretty
good
but
seeing
as
i
hate
coffee
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
this
is
one
of
the
strongest
coffee
tastes
ive
met
in
a
beer
this
beer
was
just
ok
i
bought
it
at
wine
warehouse
in
cville
pours
near
black
with
an
offwhite
head
that
hangs
around
a
bit
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
espresso
with
some
dark
fruity
esters
the
taste
is
nice
for
the
style
very
roasty
but
not
astringent
and
finishes
quite
dry
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
but
other
than
that
very
drinkable
and
nice
example
of
the
style
d
overall
a
pretty
decent
stout
that
is
worth
a
try
drinkability
not
so
high
the
flavors
are
not
particularly
enjoyable
if
the
malts
were
more
roasty
than
burnt
and
the
hops
a
little
more
balanced
i
think
it
could
be
really
pleasant
thanks
to
the
great
body
i
guess
the
beer
guy
was
right
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation

this
brew
surprised
me
pretty
tasty

in

the
smokiness
is

i
have
enjoyed
smoked
beers
in
the
past
but
this
one
was
just
a
little
too
rough
around
the
edges
drinkability
a
great
small
stout
that
i
could
enjoy
many
of
all
flavor
that
doesnt
linger
around
as
an
aftertaste
nicely
done
d
a
pretty
nice
coffeeheavy
irish
dry
stout
from
starr
hill
i
need
to
start
delving
into
some
of
these
local
beers
more
often
this
is
promising
thanks
to
chaz
over
on
realbeer
for
this
one
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
pillowy
ecru
foam
the
head
settles
to
a
thin
layer
within
a
few
minutes
nose
and
flavor
are
of
medium
roasted
grains
milk
chocolate
fresh
mild
roasted
coffee
a
bit
of
vanilla
smooth
throughout
and
finishing
dry
adequate
amount
of
carbonation
any
fan
of
the
style
needs
to
give
this
one
a
try
d
this
is
a
mighty
fine
and
simple
irish
dry
stout
this
is
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
standard
irish
stout
easily
consumed
and
sit
nice
and
light
easy
to
down
a
couple
of
these
at
any
given
time
this
is
basically
a
nicely
amped
up
guinness
to
tell
the
truth
just
better
and
not
as
mass
produced
just
a
good
all
around
brew
that
i
would
absolutely
have
again
thanks
again

does

sessionable
at
4
8
i
could
see
this
being
good
on
draft
as
well
worth
a
shot
loved
the
logo
and
the
brewery
has
an
interesting
story
as
well
i
had
this
while
visiting
relatives
in
charlottesville
va
and
it
was
in
their
refrigerator
the
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
very
little
head
the
nose
was
a
pleasant
odor
of
malt
and
coffee
if
you
sniffed
it
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
is
what
a
dark
beer
should
smell
like
the
attack
is
clean
and
smooth
as
is
the
flavor
the
finish
is
really
where
you
get
most
of
the
flavors
to
come
out
the
coffee
flavor
is
consistent
with
the
nose
and
the
smoke
flavors
are
a
not
a
surprise
but
pleasant
and
unexpected
based
on
the
nose
overall
i
would
call
it
clean
and
smooth
very
drinkable
deep
dark
blackbrown
with
a
small
head
floating
on
top
nose
is
slightly
roasted
crisp
and
malty
gentle
chocolate
very
mild
taste
is
like
an
average
stout
slight
hints
of
cream
boring
but
unoffensive
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
expected
still
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
thanks
to
the
low
abv
and
its
gentle
qualities
i
could
not
resist
the
name
poured
a
tarryblack
color
surprisingly
lighter
in
body
than
i
would
have
expected
great
drinkability
was
a
bit
too
cold
so
the
flavors
took
awhile
to
reveal
themselves
a
solid
core
of
rich
roasted
malt
and
some
nutty
caroblike
flavors
smooth
and
silky
a
very
fine
stout
i
wouldnt
recommend
trying
this
if
you
are
looking
for
anything
new
just
kind
of
an
ok
beer
this
is
a
beer
where
the
scores
dont
do
it
justice
theres
excellent
synergy
here
and
my
enjoyment
of
this
goes
well
beyond
the
scoring
of
its
individual
elements
it
drinks
quite
easily
and
could
be
considered
a
borderline
fine
sessionable
effort
ok
enough
with
the
fucking
lectures
from
across
the
pond
about
what
is
and
what
isnt
a
session
beer
by
the
way
i
get
it
wellcrafted
and
solid
after
all
these
years
overall
not
the
best
or
most
balanced
stout
but
it
is
delicious
in
its
own
way
worth
a
try
a
nice
well
done
stout
i
like
roasty
stouts
and
this
serves
it
well
very
enjoyable
this
brew
has
a
very
interesting
flavor
not
really
your
typical
stout
but
i
like
tasting
something
different
it
gets
kind
of
boring
when
all
the
beers
of
a
catagory
start
to
taste
the
same
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
purchase
before
june
notched
on
the
label
poured
two
shades
shy
of
black
with
a
dense
khakicolored
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
brew
left
behind
concentric
rings
of
lacing
as
it
was
consumed
nose
was
malty
roasty
nutty
with
a
suggestion
of
caramel
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
a
little
hops
detectable
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
watery
with
a
lively
effervescence
that
leaves
a
slight
prickle
on
the
tongue
that
lingers
between
sips
all
and
all
a
decent
session
stout
with
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
the
major
detraction
for
me
was
in
the
mouthfeel
dark
nearly
black
in
color
some
dim
mahogany
highlights
shining
through
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
tall
sturdy
head
of
tan
foam
sits
on
top
leaving
plenty
of
lace
aromas
of
mild
roasted
coffee
chocolate
and
smoke
roasted
malt
flavor
dry
bitter
unsweetened
chocolate
weak
coffee
and
some
chariness
mediumlight
bodied
and
slightly
creamy
although
there
is
an
overall
dry
bitter
quality
not
bad
and
perfectly
drinkable
good
beer
i
was
suprised
and
am
looking
for
the
oppertunity
to
pick
up
a
sixer
impressive
looks
black
with
a
creamed
coffee
colored
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
nice
lace
nose
has
milk
chocolate
a
touch
of
dark
roast
coffee
and
some
subtle
smoke
and
hop
notes
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
just
not
as
pronounced
as
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
thin
but
a
pleasant
drink
overall
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tapnitro
and
i
believe
this
is
a
decent
offering
from
starr
hill
i
just
wont
seek
it
out
12
oz
bottle
near
black
pour
with
a
surprisingly
dark
tan
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
beverages
life
dark
chocolate
roast
malt
and
coffee
aromas
flavor
not
quite
as
nice
as
the
nose
but
still
nice
coffee
and
mocha
but
a
little
sourness
just
a
bit
chalky
but
goes
along
okay
with
the
dryness
that
should
be
there
real
nice
dry
coffee
finish
the
only
thing
standing
in
this
beers
way
is
the
slight
sour
overall
good
drinkable
and
worth
trying
im
sure
this
would
be
sessionable
enough
i
would
be
very
interested
to
have
this
on
a
nitrotap
overall
would
like
to
try
on
draft
unfortunately
none
of
the
aromas
come
through
in
the
taste
just
a
sour
ashy
taste
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
i
thought
this
could
be
past
due
but
according
to
the
bottle
its
still
good
bummer
this
is
a
dark
stout
opaque
black
when
held
up
to
the
light
pours
with
a
slight
tan
head
notes
of
coffee
in
the
aroma
and
taste
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
overwhelming
i
found
it
a
pleasant
drink
it
complemented
a
roast
turkey
dinner
nicely
id
drink
it
again
drinkability
well
this
is
day
2
and
i
am
enjoying
this
tasty
beverage
had
a
few
too
many
last
night
for
a
writeup
drinkability
ok
d
easy
to
drink
flavors
are
subdued
therefore
it
does
not
wear
on
me
if
i
liked
the
beer
more
it
would
be
very
drinkable
this
one
pours
a
deep
and
dark
black
and
brown
color
with
a
very
nice
smell
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
rich
roasted
malt
with
a
very
nice
dry
finish
this
one
is
a
little
to
carbonated
for
me
so
it
would
probably
be
perfect
on
tap
but
is
a
very
good
dry
stout
drinkability
a
decent
beer
from
a
style
i
cant
say
i
care
for
too
much
though
it
beats
the
pants
off
guinness
and
does
largely
manage
to
hit
all
teh
right
notes
the
drinkabilitys
up
there
given
that
its
thin
crisp
and
decently
flavorful
without
being
over
the
top
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
good
character
a
good
american
answer
to
an
irish
stout
a
virginianbrewed
answer
to
those
hankering
for
a
guinness
a
roast
beef
and
cheddar
would
pair
well
dark
star
is
one
of
my
favourite
films
so
i
thought
id
better
have
a
crack
at
this
stout
and
im
not
disappointed
quality
stuff
deep
rich
dark
colour
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
coffee
all
over
the
nose
almost
a
burnt
toast
smell
but
in
a
good
way
and
both
the
coffee
and
the
toast
come
out
in
the
taste
coffee
toast
sounds
like
breakfast
to
me
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bottle
of
this
first
thing
in
the
morning
very
strong
dry
stout
aftertaste
nice
carbonation
and
good
body
definitely
not
the
last
bottle
of
dark
starr
ill
ever
be
drinking
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
not
bad
for
a
stout
again
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
offerings
from
starr
hill
d
the
stout
hits
some
notes
and
misses
on
others
the
smoke
profile
is
interesting
but
it
needs
to
be
supporting
a
bigger
stout
body
single
from
total
wine
fairfax
notched
as
best
by
january
a
deep
near
black
pour
with
ruby
edges
and
a
nice
tan
head
that
falls
slowly
to
a
ring
leaving
lacing
down
the
glass
at
first
the
smell
is
surprisingly
smoked
malts
that
seem
overbearing
i
think
it
was
just
a
bit
too
cold
the
smoke
fades
though
still
present
and
displays
roasted
malt
its
actually
very
inviting
when
at
the
right
temperature
taste
is
pretty
nice
as
well
the
smoke
is
more
complimentary
to
the
rest
of
the
flavors
some
light
caramel
along
with
chocolate
that
is
a
bit
sweet
and
milky
a
dose
of
roast
coffee
comes
through
as
well
giving
a
light
bitter
finish
still
its
a
little
light
and
seemingly
watered
down
compared
to
the
nose
nice
mouthfeel
that
is
light
and
slightly
creamy
at
first
a
good
roast
bitter
finish
lightly
drying
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
i
could
drink
a
bottle
or
two
im
not
so
sure
dark
starr
stout
is
the
gift
of
great
beer
like
its
label
promises
i
would
definitely
say
though
it
was
a
gift
of
good
beer
there
certainly
was
nothing
wrong
about
this
dry
stout
i
could
certainly
have
a
couple
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
charlottesville
thanks

this
poured
an
opaque
black
with
dark
tan
head
it
smelled
like
milk
and
sweet
chocolate
malt
with
subtle
earthy
barley
and
a
hint
of
coffee
it
tasted
like
earthy
barley
blended
with
weak
coffee
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
it
was
watery
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
brief
mocha
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
fairly
bland
flavor
and
weak
body
but
it
was
much
cleaner
than
their
pale
ale
so
it
wasnt
very
rewarding
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
having
it
again
if
youre
in
va
and
looking
for
a
smooth
tasty
and
sessionable
stout
this
one
is
for
you
plenty
of
roasted
malt
flavor
in
each
sip
recommended
a
decent
beer
and
would
be
pretty
easy
to
have
this
over
a
long
session
this
could
be
a
solid
on
hand
beer
but
i
think
there
are
others
that
are
better
good
local
beer
though
i
liked
it
d
other
than
the
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
i
could
imagine
using
it
for
session
drinking
not
too
bad
to
drink
light
body
and
low
abv
for
a
stout
oelergud
received
a
dark
brownleather
brown
body
w
onefinger
head
that
died
quickly
an
alright
malty
smell
with
some
light
fruit
notes
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
had
an
alright
malt
flavor
not
really
able
to
key
on
a
specific
malt
as
it
was
somewhat
bland
a
lightdry
finish
as
it
goes
down
a
tad
slick
for
a
stout
mild
fruit
flavor
also
not
a
bad
stout
but
nothing
spectacular
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
pours
with
quite
a
good
lingering
head
the
color
quite
dark
perhaps
black
without
the
roasty
shades
of
some
beers
in
this
style
i
like
the
taste
that
was
more
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
from
even
a
dry
irish
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
disappointingly
watery
as
is
the
finish
chestnut
tones
in
the
flavor
and
a
light
smokiness
build
cumulatively
as
you
drink
the
beer
overall
this
was
a
very
drinkable
irish
dry
stout
i
dont
usually
drink
this
style
but
if
i
do
it
will
be
the
dark
starr
stout
quite
a
dark
stout
with
only
a
thin
glint
of
reddishbrown
at
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
great
aroma
of
whole
coffee
beans
and
chocolate
flavor
is
lighter
than
the
aroma
but
adds
some
charred
pipe
character
to
the
bitter
roasted
malt
mouth
feel
is
mediumtofull
bodied
but
i
sensed
a
little
thinness
that
made
me
want
the
creaminess
of
a
nitro
pour
finishes
with
some
burnt
malt
toast
flavors
with
a
mild
reprise
of
the
aroma
good
stuff
d
very
drinkable
flavorful
but
goes
down
easy
nice
beer
indeed
i
would
definitely
buy
again
d
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
i
would
want
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
maybe
dry
stouts
arent
my
thing
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
a
near
opaque
black
but
for
a
bit
of
ruby
tint
when
held
to
the
light
a
thinner
light
mocha
colored
head
is
gone
quickly
leaving
no
tace
of
lace
the
roastiness
is
more
subdued
in
the
nose
than
the
palate
it
shows
thru
with
some
vanillachar
and
cocoa
highly
roasted
on
the
palate
like
dark
french
roast
coffee
and
bitter
unsweetened
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
molasses
the
only
sweetness
this
brew
shows
this
is
one
style
of
beer
i
like
on
nitro
it
rounds
the
beer
out
betteriam
sure
this
would
be
very
good
on
nitro
as
is
pretty
good
d
outstanding
this
is
a
tasty
and
extremely
sessionable
brew
a
definite
revisit
for
myself
as
well
as
a
reco
for
you
good
example
of
an
irish
dry
stout
saving
the
remaining
bottles
for
st
patricks
day
d
because
of
its
medium
body
this
is
a
very
drinkable
dry
stout
that
is
has
plenty
of
fruitiness
that
is
balanced
with
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
a
really
enjoyable
stout
ive
had
starr
hill
stuff
on
two
other
occasions
once
at
a
festival
microfestivus
roanoke
va
and
once
on
tap
depot
charlottesville
va
neither
were
this
dark
star
stout
and
neither
were
that
impressive
if
irish
dry
stouts
are
your
thing
this
probably
wont
qualify
as
an
alltime
favorite
but
itll
probably
be
worth
trying
once
or
twice
its
really
not
to
my
tastes
and
its
got
some
good
traits
but
amongst
others
in
the
style
ive
had
better
it
sure
looks
hot
though
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
not
particularly
memorable
mouthfeel
on
this
one
was
nice
as
it
is
a
lighter
bodied
stout
easy
drinking
in
the
heat
of
summer
quite
nice
and
highly
recommended
overall
impression
nice
beer
but
i
think
this
should
be
classified
as
a
dry
stout
very
drinkable
interesting
flavors
a
very
drinkable
stout
despite
its
heaviness
it
felt
like
i
could
have
knocked
back
a
few
of
them
without
tiring
dark
starr
arrives
at
the
table
a
bit
too
cold
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
black
body
and
a
small
light
brown
head
that
reduces
to
a
collar
it
smells
of
sweet
blueblackberry
jelly
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
raisins
and
maybe
even
strawberry
on
the
palate
there
are
all
these
flavors
along
with
leather
tobacco
apple
lactose
smoke
and
green
almost
pineyspicy
hops
that
impart
a
mild
bitterness
it
has
a
light
to
medium
body
with
equal
carbonation
and
leaves
a
medium
finish
overall
its
a
good
stout
one
ive
had
before
and
will
have
again
but
i
wish
this
particular
pint
werent
served
so
cold
i
got
this
pint
at
malones
in
lexington
va
it
poured
a
very
dark
color
the
head
was
small
and
very
coffee
orianted
the
lacing
that
did
appear
left
fast
and
the
retention
wasnt
much
better
the
smell
was
essentially
absent
but
what
i
could
sense
was
sweet
the
tast
was
a
really
good
coffee
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
exceptional
it
was
rigid
yet
smooth
and
not
thick
this
was
a
great
brew
balanced
with
magnum
bittering
hops
and
a
clean

the

along

factor
quite
drinkable
and
one
id
not
hesitate
to
ask
for
again
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
on
the
first
taste
i
thought
wow
but
my
impression
lessed
over
time
and
consumption
of
the
beer
both
the
aroma
and
taste
are
controlled
by
a
coffee
and
chocolate
quality
in
fact
when
i
was
drinking
this
beer
i
was
looking
around
for
the
person
drinking
an
incredible
smelling
coffee
no
kidding
the
aroma
is
that
powerful
the
taste
follows
very
similarly
to
the
aroma
it
is
dictated
by
coffee
and
chocolate
there
is
very
little
burnt
or
typical
dry
flavors
associated
with
many
dry
stouts
as
the
restaurantbrewery
classifies
it
incredibly
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
and
silky
this
is
the
perfect
after
dinner

poured
a
deep
deep

with

flavor
with
a

very
smooth
very
creamy
but
a

lighter
than
most
people
expect
from
a
stout

the

are
all
coffee

chocolate
with
a
surprising
lack
of
burnt

the
taste
starts
off
with
some
great
coffee
flavors
and
smoothly
slides
into
a
nice

tons
of
roasted
malts
in
this
but
no
burnt
bitterness
is
detectable
super
smooth
and
creamy
it
could
just
use
a
little
more

to
it
great

due
to
the

of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had

to
a
big
malt
base
and
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
extra
carbonation
for
a
unique
mouth
feel
that
helps
the
flavors
dissipate
i
think
they
achieved
their
goal
a
tasty
yet
light
session
stout
overall
this
is
an
ok
stout
there
are
some
nice
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
but
in
my
opinion
theres
too
much
espresso
licorice
and
hoppy
bitterness
for
me
to
really
like
it
further
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
as
i
like
my
stouts
to
have
a
thicker
fuller
more
viscous
mouthfeel
that
this
one
has
if
the
flavors
of
espresso
licorice
and
hoppy
bitterness
were
dialed
down
some
and
the
mouthfeel
was
thicker
more
vicious
it
would
go
a
long
way
to
making
this
a
better
stout
the
taste
was
to
me
was
very
lean
there
was
hints
of
roast
and
coffee
but
it
drinks
so
dry
and
watery
and
feels
way
over
carbonated
that
the
flavor
was
almost
mute
to
be
honest
i
like
it

im

to
find
that
any
stout
made
right
is
a
stout
worth
drinking
this
is
another
example
of
that
there
are
extraordinary
stouts
that
make

a

this
is

overall

beer
on
this
cold
january
night
thats
dipping
to
0
a
good
flavorful
stout
i
meant
to
pick
up
a
certain
imperial
stout
tonight
wasnt
available
this
was
a
great
substitute
o
decent
smoked
beer
kinda
watery
and
thin
on
the
end
overall
i
like
this
alot
its
a
slight
smokiness
and
it
is
blended
just
perfectly
off
the
toasted
malt
would
like
to
see
it
a
bit
thicker
though
maybe
a
touch
less
acidic
but
otherwise
the
flavor
is
excellent
apparently
i
had
this
sitting
in
the
fridge
since
last
august
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
it
it
dont
recall
like
an
irish
dry
stout
more
than
this
i
always
have
a
lot
of
expectation
for
a
beer
that
refuses
the
penetration
of
light
this
black
offering
comes
from
a
style
i
have
no
experience
with
irish
dry
stout
ive
had
many
stouts
but
i
dont
recall
a
category
for
either
irish
or
dry
i
like
russian
imperial
stouts
and
choclate
or
coffee
stouts
i
certainly
can
pick
up
the
dry
quality
of
this
beer
but
the
irish
escapes
me
perhaps
because
i
am
unfamiliar
with
the
style
what
was
immediately
both
present
overriding
and
persistant
was
the
smoke
ive
had
beers
with
a
hint
of
smoke
but
this
was
overpowering
last
time
i
recall
that
smell
was
when
i
was
going
through
very
old
musky
burned
out
wet
wood
buildings
looking
for
salvage
burned
out
carbon
because
i
am
not
a
fan
of
smokey
flavors
other
than
from
those
of
beef
pork
briskets
and
i
have
had
many
winter
beers
favoring
this
smoke
characteristic
i
have
yet
to
have
one
that
i
would
ask
for
by
name
again
just
not
a
fan
for
those
who
like
this
characteristic
kudos
the
appearance
was
very
promising
the
mouthfeel
right
on
but
the
flavor
too
smokey
overall
so
this
is
not
really
the
irish
dry
stout
it
claims
to
be
thats
okay
it
is
still
mighty
tasty
even
if
the
peat
is
a
little
too
strong
and
clashes
with
the
roasted
malt
drinks
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
its
good
and
well
made
and
pleasing
all
around
a
fairly
decent
light
strength
stout
that
still
delivers
on
flavor
but
a
little
average
in
the
flavor
nothing
bad
about
it
and
its
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
make
it
particularly
more
appealing
than
any
number
of
other
solidly
good
stouts
either
o
ok
at
best
not
my
favorite
style
i
liked
this
beer
even
though
its
pretty
two
dimensional
with
the
roasted
malt
and
smoke
it
had
a
lighter
feel
to
it
for
a
stout
and
was
easy
to
drink
drinking
this
beer
reminds
me
of
sitting
around
a
campfire
roasting
fresh
fish
and
tart
apples
a
very
interesting
beer
indeed
o
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
would
imagine
this
one
might
be
enjoyable
if
you
like
smoked
beers
eventhough
the
smoke
comes
through
in
a
bit
of
a
less
than
normal
sense
still
a
decent
beer
though
overall
a
nice
beer

this

presence
detract
from
the

aspects
of
this
smoked
stout
overall
pretty

stuff
really
and
has
held
up
nicely
over

year
the
flavor
was

all
the
parts
seemed
to

one
worth
picking
up

it

bit
more
complex
adding
in
some
dark
chocolate
alongside
the
dark
dark
coffee
roasted
malt
is
dominant
and
becomes
a
bit
too
dry
and
bitter
in
the
finish
pretty
solid
effort
id
have
this
again
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
irish
stouts
i
have
had
would
have
thought
there
would
have
been
more
flavors
in
the
taste
given
the
smell
but
overall
a
really
nice
brew
bottle
poured
a
deep
amber
color
lager
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
lightly
caramelized
malt
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
of
biscuit
malt
is
very
refreshing
with
limited
complexity
body
is
quite
full
for
style
with
good
carbonation
as
well
well
brewed
and
easily
drinkable
which
i
bet
was
the
goal
of
this
one
furthermore
never
heard
of
them
furthermore
i
certainly
wanted
to
try
the
stout
seemed
like
a
good
after
dinner
drink
furthermore
what
the
heck
why
not
the
was
a
deep
rich
dark
beer
with
creamy
head
the
scent
gave
way
a
sweet
malt
with
roasty
undertones
the
taste
was
a
little
lacking
to
me
i
want
stouts
that
are
fuller
in
body
sort
of
like
chewy
the
beer
furthermore
the
beer
was
very
sweet
not
to
my
liking
the
mothfeel
was
fine
but
a
little
too
much
going
on
but
nothing
solid
going
on
futhermore
it
is
worth
a
try
an
american
hopped
version
of
an
irish
stout
worth
a
try
i
really
like
peat
beer
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
relying
on
the
peat
a
bit
to
much
plus
has
a
bit
of
and
off
flavor
in
the
finish
drinkability
a
decent
session
stout

this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
stouts
ive
had
but
could
use
a
little
more
somethingchocolate
malt
dextrins
something
pours
a
deep
black
coffee
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
some
malt
as
well
as
a
little
peaty
smoke
tastes
smoky
from
the
peat
with
big
roasted
malt
flavors
and
little
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
tiny
carbonation
drinkability
is
medium
dnot
my
favorite
but
the
smoky
peat
makes
this
an
interesting
one
to
try
but
only
once
d
decent
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
its
a
good
twist
on
it
i
did
like
the
hop
bite
of
the
brew
but
its
not
something
ill
come
back
to
in
the
future
i
finally
found
a
furthermore
beer
that
i
may
come
back
to
time
to
time
the
flavor
comes
off
well
and
the
body
is
spot
on
with
a
lowish
abv
this
is
one
i
can
see
drinking
a
few
of
on
a
fallwinter
night
while
being
unphased
by
this
breweries
light
beers
maybe
they
shine
in
the
dark
spectrum
of
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
moderately
creamy
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
good
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
loved
the
smokiness
it
had
to
it
there
arent
enough
stouts
that
display
smoke
this
nicely
in
my
opinion
very
nice
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
something
i
would
definitely
drink
again
d
this
is
my
first
furthermore
and
it
really
is
quite
good
i
may
purchase
the
variety
and
review
it
here
damn
good
beer
whoa

by

at

then

was

noticeable
only
at
the

a
pronounced

characteristic
underlain
by
a

medium
with
a
riot
of
smoke
charcoal
coffee
and
chocolate
all
vying
for
attention
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
the
finish
was
really
smoky
where
it
counted
the
label
mentioned
with
a
hint
of
peat
smoked
malt
this
stout
is
a
return
to
county
cork
and
the
warmth
of
the
irish
hearth
i
may
soon
need
a
laydown
overall
it
does
have
drinkability
with
a
good
blend
of
flavors
that
are
lightly
applied
and
so
are
not
angry
or
challenging
to
the
palate
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
earthy
hops
with
some
toffee
chocolate
and
nuttyness
the
flavor
is
toffee
with
quite
a
bit
of
smoke
the
smoke
was
a
surprise
since
i
didnt
get
any
of
it
in
the
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
flvor
delivers
that
same
great
smoky
malt
almost
in
rauchbier
territory
and
i
love
it
the
thing
that
makes
this
beer
stellaar
is
the
foamy
creamy
lively
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
awesome
this
beer
has
a
light
frothiness
that
provides
a
surprising
balance
to
the
rich
smoky
malt
not
at
all
sweet
great
job
d
this
is
one
helluva
good
stout
one
that
i
would
recommend
to
anybody
that
enjoys
a
good
flavorful
dark
beer
two
thumbs
up
to
furthermore
on
this
one
d
the
smoked
malts
are
a
nice
addition
adding
depth
to
the
roasted
malt
side
a
sessionable
stout
a
very
flavorful
beer
just
what
i
would
expect
from
this
brewery
skål

taste
not
quite
as
exuberantly
exciting
as
i
initially
remember
still
darn

though
this
is

i
will
not
hesitate
to
buy
this
one
again

i

the
makeweight
a
dry

with
a
strong
peat
smokiness
though
enough
malt
character
still
comes
through
smokiness
does
seem
to
grow
as
it
progresses
think
of
a
traditional
irish
dry
stout
with
more
peat
enjoyable
though
smoky
character
does
impact
drinkability
a
bit
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
rather
heavy
peat
character
d
very
drinkable
actually
a
treat
to
drink
w
som
much
flavor
furthermore
is
a
brewery
to
take
seriously
i
have
tasted
3
offerings
so
far
and
not
a
clunker
yet
very
drinkable
brew
and
im
not
all
that
enthused
about
smoked
brews
nice
a
12
ounce
bottle
picked
up
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
around
1
75
poured
into
my
victory
shaker
glass
the
stout
appears
an
opaque
chestnut
color
with
about
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
smoked
malt
lightly
smoked
meat
chocolate
covered
bacon
somewhat
fruity
coffee
sweet
malt
body
could
be
fuller
carbonation
is
decent
for
the
style
a
tasty
smoked
stout
worth
trying
if
you
dig
that
sort
of
thing
it
goes
down
easy
enough
a
beer
i
would
only
occasionally
drink
but
one
of
the
more
flavorful
irish
dry
stouts
i
have
had
the
privilege
of
trying
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
pretty
interesting
that
they
brew
this
using
peat
smoked
malt
credit
to
furthermore
for
another
unique
beer
it
is
a
really
good
drink
d
pretty
solid
offering
with
only
minor
complaints
for
this
being
my
first
irish
dry
stout
i
have
to
say
i
am
quite
intrigued
by
the
way
the
furthermore
folks
worked
the
peat
into
the
beer
very
interesting
and
definitely
something
i
would
like
to
try
again
just
not
too
frequently
this
beer
pours
a
semiclear
black
color
the
head
is
half
and
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
into
almost
not
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
beat
it
is
a
very
pleasant
aroma
and
quite
strong
for
a
dry
stout
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
more
peat
the
peat
isnt
overpowering
or
what
i
would
call
strong
but
there
is
enough
of
it
that
it
is
very
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
appropriately
low
carbonation
and
a
creamy
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
md
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
creamy
feel
moderate
carbonaion
easy
drinking
if
you
like
smoke
the
smoke
could
be
a
little
overwhelming
if
it
isnt
your
thing
appearance
is
good
very
opaque
dark
brownish
with
almost
no
head
or
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
good
a
slight
amount
of
dry
malt
and
bitter
chocolatecoffee
there
is
actually
a
slight
amount
of
hops
here
very
light
body
for
a
stout
in
my
opinion
but
the
right
level
of
carbonation
is
there
drinkability
is
pretty
good
pours
an
almost
pitch
black
but
with
some
dark
brown
highlights
great
two
finger
head
and
a
thick
foam
that
retains
through
almost
all
12
ounces
the
aroma
is
smokey
and
peety
with
just
a
little
coffee
chocolate
and
cream
his
stouts
hits
the
palate
smooth
silky
and
full
of
smoke
at
the
start
the
peet
and
roasted
mlt
mix
for
the
middle
the
finish
has
the
smoke
peet
roasted
malts
faint
coffee
and
light
chocolate
powder
great
flavored
irish
stout
with
flavorable
sessionability
just
bold
enough
to
keep
your
interest
yet
it
remains
very
drinkable
cant
wait
to
try
this
one
in
a
roast
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nicely
balanced
and
the
smoke
isnt
overbearing
at
all
my
one
wish
would
be
a
bit
less
caramel
and
a
bit
more
chocolate
which
would
bump
this
one
up
a
bit
as
the
caramel
meeting
the
smoke
while
quite
tasty
does
tend
to
wear
on
me
in
terms
of
drinkability
d
decent
could
belly
up
for
a
few
on
a
cold
day
an
interesting
beer
but
it
just
wasnt
that
good
it
was
worth
a
try
if
you
like
peat
smoke
flavor
d
very
good
for
a
dry
stout
something
id
like
to
check
out
again
and
glad
to
try
something
from
this
brewery
very
sessionable
and
something
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
if
given
the
opportunity
update
102009
now
listed
on
the
newish
website
at

5
abv
about
right
got
another
single
thinking
i
hadnt
tried
this
on
to
another
go
with
refinements
only
the
head
has
that
guinness
look
like
its
foaming
up
to
explode
slowly
using
a
sam
adams
glass
to
try
this
one
no
light
comes
through
a
smoky
nose
reveals
the
peat
smoked
malt
almost
dominates
all
the
aforementioned
flavors
are
there
with
the
smokiness
a
bit
more
than
i
remember
very
nice
its
not
refined
but
doesnt
overpower
making
it
sessionable
still
high
drinkability
deserved
i
bump
the
smell
5
for
more
smokiness
well
done
here
solid
stout
ill
pick
up
more
as
its
fairly
cheap
and
well
worth
it
pretty
much
pitch
black
with
a
light
tan
head
that
is
fairly
compact
and
somewhat
persistent
very
earthy
peaty
nose
earthy
notes
mix
with
a
bit
of
coffee
bakers
chocolate
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
prickly
perhaps
a
little
overcarbed
chocolate
flavors
in
the
dryish
finish
a
little
watery
upfront
but
it
is
an
irish
stout
after
all
overall
a
very
peaty
earthy
stout
and
i
approve
i
purchased
this
up
in
wisconsin
a
town
nearby
was
called
black
earth
this
should
be
the
towns
official
beer
d
i
will
take
a
lot
of
wi
brews
of
this
one
dont
know
the
price
of
it
around
town
but
for
a
2
tap
it
was
worth
it
pitch
black
with
a
ruby
hue
and
little
head
smells
of
wonderful
smoked
malt
caramel
a
unique
scent
from
the
peat
and
a
little
bit
of
citrus
to
top
it
off
the
flavor
is
predominantly
the
malt
warm
and
robust
it
seems
like
there
are
about
three
distinct
malts
in
the
blend
but
i
cant
really
separate
them
so
easily
the
peat
does
give
it
a
wonderful
smoky
quality
however
fairly
clean
on
the
finish
for
such
a
dark
brew
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
something
i
could
get
used
to
having
around
for
when
im
not
on
a
hop
binge
dgood
but
with
this
pronounced
smokiness
this
one
is
not
a
session
beer
however
the
smokiness
is
not
overpowering
and
this
beer
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
smoked
brews
because
it
showcases
the
smoke
effectively
while
allowing
the
other
beer
elements
their
times
to
shine
d
this
is
an
interesting
irish
dry
stout
the
smoky
flavor
is
a
unique
twist
on
the
style
d
i
was
kind
of
hoping
for
in
the
faceoverthetop
smokiness
but
what
i
got
was
pretty
damn
nice
the
smokiness
in
the
beer
was
classy
and
balanced
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
and
hopefully
soon
this
beer
is
sofaking
great
a
deep
brownish
hue
near
black
with
shades
of
rust
frothy
tan
head
that
falls
slowly
to
a
ring
smell
is
huge
in
the
smoked
meat
department
whoa
now
not
really
offensive
but
huge
taste
is
great
the
smoke
is
complimented
well
by
other
flavors
some
chocolate
light
caramel
and
coffee
and
an
earthy
hop
presence
its
like
a
dry
stout
with
a
smoke
addition
that
is
on
a
larger
scale
than
usual
similar
to
what
youd
find
in
a
rauchbier
very
good
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
silky
smooth
with
a
light
smoke
edge
damn
i
really
liked
this
beer
at
first
i
thought
it
was
overwhelming
but
it
definitely
grew
on
me
through
the
glass
wish
i
had
more
but
this
is
it
thanks
goes
to
maximum12
for
the
extra
in
a
recent
trade
yet
another
nice
surprise
goodnight
d
i
really
like
this
stout
some
can
get
fairly
thick
and
leave
you
not
wanting
another
but
not
this
one
not
sure
if
i
got
a
good
batch
here
or
if
i
am
just
a
bigger
fan
of
this
brew
than
most
previous
reviewers
this
is
my
kind
of
stout
and
something
that
will
be
purchased
again
this
is
my
first
brew
from
this
brewery
and
it
has
me
looking
forward
to
more
its
easily
drinkable
full
of
flavour
and
likely
low
enough
in
abv
to
be
sessioned
medium
body
medium
carbonation
tad
thin
i
like
this
beer
it
brings
something
new
to
the
table
the
mix
of
your
standard
stout
with
the
peat
smokiness
is
awesome
d
yup
its
good
and
well
worth
a
pint
i
think
there
is
much
more
potential
for
this
to
be
a
session
beer
if
it
could
be
served
from
a
beer
engine
otherwise
this
is
not
worth
trying
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
smokiness
gives
this
beer
a
nice
added
flavor
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
liked
the
little
bit
of
sweetness
that
happened
to
balance
out
with
the
smoke
flavor
the
smoke
is
strong
but
it
isnt
too
overpowering
which
makes
it
a
very
nice
beer
hv
pours
a
dark
red
almost
purple
got
about
2
fingers
worth
of
head
from
the
pour
aroma
is
mild
but
you
get
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
in
there
the
first
taste
is
earthy
almost
grainy
to
be
honest
i
have
no
idea
what
peat
moss
taste
like
but
i
imagine
it
is
similiar
to
what
you
get
in
here
you
do
get
a
smokey
taste
but
it
isnt
at
all
over
powering
if
you
are
a
fan
of
other
smoked
beers
then
you
wont
be
disappointed
if
however
you
are
like
me
and
do
not
really
go
for
smoked
beers
you
will
find
this
is
actually
pretty
pleasant
the
flavors
are
all
there
but
not
anyone
over
powering
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
excellent
if
you
have
a
chance
definitely
try
this
one
especially
if
you
like
rauchbier
or
smoked
porters
i
generally
do
not
like
irish
stouts
but
this
beer
has
changed
my
mind
about
them
have
to
seek
it
out
if
and
when
it
is
offered
on
cask
an
abv
of
5
5
also
helps
drinkability
pours
almost
black
with
hints
of
red
fairly
visible
on
the
fringes
tastes
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
but
very
quaffable
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
still
be
reasonable
the
peat
adds
a
dryness
that
complements
the
style
but
does
take
away
from
the
traditional
roastiness
finish
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
roasted
and
rich
brew
that
is
pleasant
on
the
palate
without
overdoing
the
malt
or
smoke
nicely
proportioned
d
just
not
for
me
thats
all
i
liked
this
brew
very
easy
drinking
a
touch
thin
but
considering
its
not
a
nitro
that
can
be
expected
a
smooth
drinker
that
doesnt
fill
you
up
or
put
you
half
in
the
bag
absolutely
sessionable
a
neat
take
on
the
style
for
sure
but
not
my
favorite
a
great
pairing
with
bbq
ribs
mouthfell
was
ok
but
it
is
a
stout
it
better
have
a
decent
feel
to
it
i
choked
half
of
this
beer
down
let
it
warm
and
tried
it
at
different
incriment
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
but
down
the
drain
it
went
into
my
pint
glass
pours
pretty
much
pitch
black
a
nice
size
tan
head
ok
lacing
pretty
decent
the
aroma
is
loaded
with
peat
and
smokiness
some
coffee
and
maybe
a
little
bittersweet
chocolate
there
is
even
more
peat
and
smoke
in
the
taste
roasty
and
toasty
malts
very
roasted
coffee
and
a
bit
peppery
spiced
the
mouth
is
smooth
a
little
dry
toward
the
end
good
body
and
carbonation
i
liked
this
beer
since
i
first
had
it
and
good
smoky
brew
a
nice
brew
if
you
like
smoky
beers
but
this
one
i
wont
get
again
just
for
that
reason
the
flavor
has
a
good
dose
of
smoked
malt
with
a
dry
finish
its
got
a
lightmedium
body
and
the
flavor
is
not
overpowering
the
smokiness
lingers
on
throughout
very
drinkable
d
i
am
not
a
fan
of
peat
malt
but
it
blends
nicely
in
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
if
youre
a
fan
of
dry
irish
stouts
i
would
recommend
this
the
smokiness
adds
an
extra
dimension
to
an
already
good
beer
overall
the
beer
looks
great
in
the
class
but
doesnt
seem
to
deliver
decent
beer
but
a
bit
thin
lacks
aggressiveness
and
seems
to
have
a
brewing
flaw
though
nothing
im
not
going
to
finish
and
enjoy
this
is
a
good
beverage
but
it
is
ever
so
close
to
being
truly
remarkable
pours
a
dark
chestnutbrown
in
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
of
good
duration
head
consists
of
dense
almost
tiny
bubbles
lacing
is
solid
and
this
is
opaque
when
held
up
to
the
light
smokey
the
smoke
fairly
obscures
the
malts
but
there
are
hints
at
the
dark
and
chocolate
malts
that
lie
beneath
as
well
as
a
hint
of
sweetness
very
agreeable
on
the
first
sip
with
a
fullbodied
impression
smokey
and
a
bit
sweet
with
all
of
the
better
qualities
of
the
style
coming
to
the
fore
along
with
some
bitter
chocolate
and
light
espresso
notes
closer
to
fullbodied
than
many
of
the
stouts
ive
had
in
this
style
and
remarkably
smooth
although
the
smoke
lingers
it
doesnt
totally
obscure
the
finer
malt
and
hop
qualities
present
here
theres
a
roasted
malt
profile
that
hovers
just
undeneath
the
smoke
an
assertiveyet
forgiving
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
oilyness
that
adds
great
depth
to
the
malt
profile
top
notch
folks
now
lets
hope
furthermore
sticks
around
a
while
a
wonderful
smoked
beer
thats
underrated
in
my
opinion
more
people
need
to
give
this
a
try
pours
dark
brown
a
deep
walnut
color
small
khaki
head
chocolate
and
smoked
malt
odor
fairly
pedestrian
and
a
little
sour
smelling
fizzy
aggressively
better
in
an
old
coffee
grounds
way
too
biting
and
sour
with
not
enough
chocolate
or
malt
flavor
to
back
it
up
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
i
liked
the
knot
stock
a
lot
better
an
above
average
but
not
great
stout
if
not
for
the
hint
of
peat
it
would
be
fairly
unremarkable
and
the
peat
really
is
just
a
hint
the
nose
has
some
nice
toasty
notes
good
solid
coffee
stout
flavors
with
the
peat
and
some
vaguely
sweet
milky
notes
coming
in
late
nice
dry
finish
this
might
grow
on
me
three
feet
deep
would
be
better
if
it
was
six
feet
deep
having
said
that
this
is
very
good
beer
that
has
that
furthermore
twist
that
ive
come
to
know
and
love
if
you
like
wellcrafted
beer
that
comes
at
you
from
a
slightly
different
direction
give
this
brewery
a
look
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fast
moving
slightly
prickly
carbonation
goes
down
easy
while
seeming
to
be
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
a
stout
overall
a
tasty
stout
with
a
nice
twist
from
the
peat
smoked
malts
i
wouldnt
mind
sitting
down
to
a
few
bottles
of
this
one
glad
to
see
a
new
brewer
in
wisconsin
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
offerings
drinkability
was
only
average
flavors
were
fleeting
i
felt
it
too
watery
to
enjoy
too
carbonated
and
too
dry
thin
mouthfeel
roastiness
keeps
the
drinkability
at
moderate
levels
a
good
interpretation
of
a
smoky
scotch
ale
rich
deeply
roasted
and
noticeably
smoky
three
feet
deep
delivers
a
full
sensory
experience
starting
with
visual
of
the
creamy
darktan
head
atop
its
ebonycolored
body
it
follows
that
up
with
a
solid
roastiness
in
the
nose
thats
reminiscent
of
an
early
morning
campfire
its
roasty
ashen
lightly
smokey
and
slightly
pinelike
or
leafy
in
the
background
the
body
is
medium
and
its
slick
and
gently
oily
across
the
palate
with
a
delicate
restrained
carbonation
the
flavor
brings
some
added
dark
caramel
to
the
mix
buoying
the
roastiness
and
soft
smokiness
a
thin
thread
of
bittersweet
chocolate
runs
through
it
and
theres
a
suggestion
of
leafy
grassy
and
piney
hops
in
the
backgropund
the
bitterness
is
quite
firm
but
not
pressing
and
not
much
is
needed
to
help
the
roasty
smoky
and
gently
peppery
character
in
the
dry
softly
lingering
finish
very
nicely
done
bit
of
whisper
of
whiskey
in
there
too
hmmm
was
that
intentional
he
muses
sarcastically
this
was
my
first
furthermore
brew
i
will
surely
try
another
d
this
beer
is
better
and
having
flavors
beside
bandaid
peat
flavors
but
they
are
still
to
strong
for
me
and
i
would
like
to
taste
the
malt
flavors
over
the
peat
this
beer
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
plentiful
dark
tan
head
aroma
is
of
chocolate
and
little
else
flavor
is
light
meaty
smokiness
like
a
ham
which
reminded
me
of
an
ofallon
smoked
porter
i
had
awhile
back
very
interesting
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
this
beer
is
still
fairly
drinkable
single
purchased
at
star
in
madison
smuggled
back
in
a
suitcase
drinkabilityoverall
a
solid
beer
overall
doesnt
wow
but
little
detracts
from
the
beers
mission
a
smoked
peat
irish
dry
drinkability
pretty
good
doesnt
do
it
for
me
while
this
might
not
make
my
list
of
regulars
it
definitely
stands
out
as
an
interesting
change
of
pace
i
give
furthermore
props
for
using
the
peat
its
risky
and
i
cant
see
many
people
liking
this
beer
still
that
managed
to
restrain
themselves
to
a
degree
and
the
beer
remains
drinkable
by
any
standards
regardless
of
ones
affinity
for
peat
and
meat
i
love
this
one
for
a
milwaukee
wi
brew
i
had
this
beer
with
a
steak
and
baked
potato
the
beer
was
a
good
complement
to
the
food
i
would
drink
this
one
again
a
very
impressive
dark
bittersweet
stout
very
welldone
not
a
favorite
but
a
straight
forward
stout
o
im
assuming
hopefully
that
this
is
some
sort
of
brewers
mistake
it
tastes
like
soy
sauce
and
beef
not
really
a
pleasant
taste
or
aroma
m
fizzy
prickly
carbonation
on
a
lighter
side
of
medium
thickness
body
pours
a
black
color
with
a
creamy
fluffy
head
has
a
strong
cocoacoffee
scent
texture
is
thick
creamy
and
robust
it
was
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
but
still
very
flavorful
and
filling
as
the
robust
flavors
overwhelm
your
taste
buds
definitely
a
must
try
drinkability
awesome
stuff
who
knew
ethnic
germans
and
poles
could
brew
such
awesome
irishinspired
beer
o
a
very
good
stout
smooth
lots
of
character
and
highly
drinkable
d
not
for
me
doesnt
live
up
to
the
rep
of
good
dry
stouts
overall
right
on
for
the
style
but
nothing
special
oi
like
this
one
not
quite
as
heavy
as
most
making
it
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
a
bit
overcarbd
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
pours
near
black
with
a
light
mocha
head
this
recedes
quite
quickly
leaving
a
spot
or
two
of
lacing
thin
collar
nose
is
pretty
plain
with
just
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
as
it
warms
still
not
much
more
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
with
the
roasted
malt
pairing
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
bitter
strong
coffee
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
smooth
bitterness
in
the
finish
pretty
good
all
around
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
made
up
of
lighter
malts
but
there
is
not
really
much
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
roasted
malt
and
not
too
much
else
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
very
one
dimensional
and
not
too
exciting
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
a
mostly
enjoyable
stout
o
d
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
pretty
solid
all
around
interesting
without
being
overpowering
o
probably
my
favorite
seasonal
from
sprecher
this
beer
never
disappoints
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
have
a
bunch
of
these
whilst
hanging
out
in
an
irish
pub
i
will
definitely
get
this
beer
again
finish
is
actually
a
decent
bitter
coffee
such
that
the
end
of
the
beer
is
the
beer
although
short
and
nothing
other
than
a
bit
of
roasted
grain
surely
a
sweet
stout
from
my
view
purchased
from
the
sprecher
gift
shop
in
glendale
wi

a
black

in

a

i
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
i
probably
would
try
again
ive
been
looking
for
an
irish
stout
i
can
really
get
behind
drinking
for
st
patricks
day
and
i
think
this
is
it
although
that
holiday
has
come
and
gone
this
year
ill
look
forward
to
drinking
sprecher
next
march
ive
had
sprechers
rootbeer
but
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
them
the
irish
stout
pours
very
dark
also
appears
to
be
somewhat
thick
smells
a
little
sweet
it
is
similar
to
other
irish
stouts
taste
again
is
very
similar
to
other
irish
stouts
ive
had
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
strong
like
black
coffee
overall
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
beer
obviously
not
the
greatest
irish
stout
out
there
but
this
a
very
decent
beer
overall
a
tasty
non
nitro
poured
ids
dhigh
for
someone
who
enjoys
a
great
dark
stout
great
for
winter
and
fall
back
in
the
day
20
years
ago
this
must
have
been
the
shit
but
now
with
so
many
good
session
stouts
on
the
market
sprechers
version
is
left
behind
still
a
decent
buy
only
1
99
for
the
pintsized
bottle
dgreat
fallwinter
or
whenever
you
need
a
stout
beer
beer
d
like
most
irishstyle
stouts
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
is
a
nice
coldweather
session
beer
d
a
great
stout
that
certainly
stands
up
well
to
the
classic
of
the
style
guinness
simple
yet
delicious
straightforward
but
enjoyable
one
of
my
favorites
from
sprecher
a
beautiful
black
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
a
few
seconds
after
the
pour
smell
of
a
nice
roast
notes
with
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
nice
fizz
in
the
mouth
a
little
bitterness
light
roast
flavors
small
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
a
nice
dry
stout
easy
to
drink
good
session
beer
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
d
as
fullbodied
as
it
is
its
definitely
more
of
a
drinkable
stout
very
water
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
much
much
better
in
the
hops
department
as
it
warms
definitely
beats
the
pants
off
guinness
and
the
like
for
hop
flavor
tis
the
season
for
irish
stout
the
caramel
aftertaste
and
the
coffee
taste
is
very
typical
of
a
stout
the
dark
amber
color
is
barley
see
through
and
has
a
light
creamy
head
that
settles
into
the
beer
leaving
a
light
film
on
top
this
beer
is
nice
in
drinkability
very
good
for
all
day
st
patty
drink
d
a
very
nice
stout
i
will
definitely
be
taking
advantage
of
having
sprecher
within
30
miles
from
my
house
and
buy
this
at
the
local
liquor
store
often
until
the
season
is
over
id
love
to
pick
up
a
growler
if
im
in
the
area
i
think
im
gonna
make
it
happen
watery
looking
jet
black
color
not
much
of
a
head
and
no
retention
the
color
is
better
than
guiness
but
needs
some
more
foam
for
sure
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
stale
an
dry
marshmellows
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
makes
me
thinkof
malted
milk
balls
with
an
almost
burnt
roasted
malt
flavor
flavorful
and
sessionable
nondairy
creamer
palate
but
darkly
and
dry
roasted
im
a
big
fan
of
thick
dark
beers
so
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
it
might
be
a
little
too
dark
for
some
d
a
delicious
stout
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
sweeter
stout
but
this
beer
is
watery
and
with
an
aftertates
to
match
pours
a
deep
black
with
traces
of
dark
mahogany
around
the
edges
w
a
small
brown
cap
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
decent
lacing
in
my
nonic
not
a
strong
smell
a
buttery
caramelcoffee
aroma
with
faint
hints
of
dried
plum
and
vanilla
an
almost
too
thin
flavor
a
french
roasted
coffee
taste
up
front
with
some
hop
bite
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
darker
fruit
with
a
not
unpleasant
tart
vinous
meaty
undertone
midway
finishes
a
bit
smokey
with
a
mineral
note
a
lightmed
body
not
as
dry
as
most
irish
stouts
and
modestly
carbonated
yet
stays
creamy
a
very
drinkable
brew
in
fact
im
going
to
have
one
at
every
bbq
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
black
malt
notes
with
good
flavor
but
not
much
depth
or
character
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
enjoy
a
few
more
in
a
sitting
however
it
felt
like
it
was
lacking
something
in
the
taste
d
an
oustanding
irish
dry
stout
made
here
in
america
will
definitely
try
again
had
this
again

5
years
later
creamy
dark
dying
finish
not
a
bad
one
although
its
not
what
i
expected
i
say
this
as
unfortunetly
most
of
us
compare
irish
stouts
to
guiness
however
its
still
a
great
offering
i
feel
this
would
serve
as
a
great
steping
stone
towards
trying
a
russian
imperial
stout
for
the
first
time
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
roasted
and
black
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
hop
aroma
its
quite
dry
with
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
complex
malt
flavor
that
boasts
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
dry
hoppy
finish
its
smooth
with
just
a
bit
of
a
metallic
offflavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
that
very
enjoyable
recommended
sprecher
irish
style
stout
is
good
beer
even
though
i
prefer
the
big
maltintensive
stouts
theres
something
about
a
wellbrewed
irish
dry
stout
that
hits
the
spot
on
occasion
well
done
overall
a
very
solid
stout
not
the
best
out
there
but
definitely
good
for
everyday
consumption
a
nice
job
these
classic
and
traditional
beers
are
sprechers
strong
suit
this
is
almost
sessionable
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
robust
stout
with
all
the
standard
flavors
but
the
brew
manages
to
remain
drinkable
despite
the
full
body
and
rich
flavors
present
cheers
virtually
pitch
black
aroma
doesnt
have
as
much
roastiness
as
some
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
is
there
too
taste
is
mostly
roasted
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
supple
with
just
the
right
amount
of
drying
finish
after
a
while
drinkability
is
good
overall
a
decent
offering
from
a
company
i
always
associated
with
germanstyle
beers
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
tan
in
color
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
thin
layer
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
cream
and
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
a
nice
mild
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
sessionable
dry
stout
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
into
a
guinness
glass
pours
very
dark
black
a
nice
creamy
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
fades
to
a
thin
film
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
behind
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
light
chocolate
and
a
faint
espresso
qualities
roasty
nice
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
too
good
roastiness
and
some
faint
espresso
chocolates
are
tasty
good
bitterness
that
rides
in
with
a
fine
carbonation
after
a
smooth
start
if
i
could
get
anything
more
out
of
it
thatd
be
great
but
as
it
is
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
sprecher
sure
does
do
dark
beers
well
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
great
as
i
initially
sipped
it
a
little
cooler
than
what
the
proper
temp
is
then
allowed
it
warm
up
very
nice
probably
sad
to
say
this
but
i
enjoyed
the
larger
bottles
the
price
i
picked
up
for
this
4pak
was
quite
decent
and
the
16
ounce
bottles
make
it
feel
worth
even
more
cant
find
much
fault
in
this
but
its
a
bit
too
ordinary
for
me
to
fuss
over
sprechers
irish
style
stout
pours
a
typical
black
body
and
frothythencreamy
tan
head
with
an
average
amount
of
lace
left
behind
in
the
nose
its
roasty
and
a
nip
chocolatey
with
some
mild
background
hops
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
its
gently
carbonated
leaving
it
smooth
across
the
palate
with
just
a
gentle
tingle
to
awaken
the
tastebuds
the
flavor
is
fuller
and
less
acidic
than
most
examples
and
it
offers
a
lightly
sweet
note
of
gently
caramelish
malt
and
yeasty
fruitiness
before
it
dispalys
its
softly
roasted
side
the
bitterness
is
present
but
soft
and
just
enough
to
keep
the
malt
in
check
before
leading
to
a
dry
finish
that
lingers
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
then
lightly
charred
roastiness
drinkability
smooth
and
creamy
the
low
carbonation
level
makes
it
easy
to
have
a
couple
d
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
offering
a
little
tweek
in
all
area
would
make
this
a
very
nice
beer
first
and
foremost
this
beer
is
mislabeled
as
a
milk
stout
or
milk
porter
i
would
give
this
one
a
better
review
but
as
an
irish
stoutthere
are
a
few
problems
firstly
this
beer
suffers
from
a
lack
of
head
retention
secondly
its
transparentblack
but
transparent
third
this
beer
is
sweetkinda
like
a
milk
stout
also
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
light
now
for
the
good
pointsthere
is
an
excellent
mochachocha
richness
going
on
in
the
flavor
really
the
taste
is
just
sublime
furthermore
the
chocolatecoffee
flavors
make
way
for
caramel
macchiato
and
ultimately
a
wonderfully
bitter
hopped
finish
the
aroma
is
equally
delicious
if
sprecher
could
fix
the
appearance
and
thicken
the
body
this
would
be
one
hell
of
a
stout
as
it
is
its
quite
drinkable
and
very
nice
tasting
just
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
pours
a
standard
black
stout
color
nothing
exciting
about
it
a
quick
diminishing
head
is
present
for
a
brief
period
smells
of
roasty
goodness
smells
strictly
of
roastiness
taste
is
initially
bitter
the
bitterness
comes
from
the
roasty
malts
and
hops
not
much
of
a
malt
body
to
back
this
one
up
the
signiture
sprecher
yeast
twang
is
here
too
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
water
very
light
this
could
be
quite
possibly
the
best
session
stout
i
have
had
very
easy
to
drink
unfortunately
that
isnt
everything
one
of
sprechers
better
best
seasonal
offerings
very
deep
in
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
marginal
lace
aromas
are
malt
drivenrich
caramel
chocolate
with
some
butterydiacytal
notes
on
the
tail
end
medium
to
full
bodied
with
brisk
carbonation
the
beer
exhibits
a
bit
of
a
smokeyfishy
flavor
and
some
off
putting
buttery
nuances
as
well
as
the
usual
suspectsdark
roasted
malts
giving
the
usual
chocolatecoffee
tastes
i
wish
this
beer
leaned
more
to
the
restrained
bitterdry
than
the
hedonistic
but
hey
its
sprecher
decent
but
not
anything
out
of
the
box
had
this
on
tap
on
irish
fest
in
milwaukee
which
of
course
means
plastic
cups
it
looked
a
very
dark
black
color
gave
off
a
mild
hop
mocha
aroma
which
didnt
hint
at
the
wonderful
taste
that
i
experienced
on
the
first
sip
rich
mocha
dark
chocolate
that
seemed
to
get
stronger
as
i
went
through
the
cup
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
a
creamier
texture
would
have
made
this
near
perfection
the
aftertaste
was
wonderful
only
available
twice
a
year
if
the
bottled
stuff
taste
this
good
im
loading
up
this
years
batch
2003
was
brewed
in
a
pretty
small
quantity
even
more
so
than
past
years
so
availability
is
said
to
be
somewhat
of
an
issue
ive
had
this
on
tap
at
irish
fest
in
milwaukee
and
its
a
pretty
solid
offering
out
of
the
bottle
though
i
wish
the
body
was
a
little
more
creamier
and
fuller
nose
could
be
enhanced
too
its
good
but
just
a
tad
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
really
good
stout
overall
a
welcomed
offering
to
celebrate
st
patricks
day
a
very
tasty
beer
with
a
great
aroma
looks
more
ruby
redbrownish
than
black
and
when
i
hold
it
to
light
it
is
clearer
than
you
would
expect
a
stout
small
soft
lace
sweet
milk
chocolate
hot
cocoa
and
some
coffee
tones
on
the
nose
a
great
taste
too
strong
milk
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
coffee
grounds
in
the
background
minimal
hopping
and
doesnt
seem
hopped
up
as
much
as
a
dry
stout
should
be
very
good
taste
but
thin
in
body
which
makes
it
very
easy
drinking
but
less
than
ideal
for
a
stout
i
would
guess
the
abv
as
low
but
i
dont
know
for
sure
solid
and
tasty
but
lacking
the
special
characteristics
of
an
outstanding
stout
almost
black
in
appearance
doesnt
poor
much
of
a
head
which
is
disappointing
for
an
irish
stout
aroma
has
great
chocolate
roasted
notes
i
almost
get
a
little
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
in
the
aroma
as
well
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
great
dark
coffee
taste
im
getting
a
nice
taste
coming
from
the
yeast
i
believe
it
is
unique
to
me
nice
bitterness
finishes
dry
very
solid
stout
still
not
bad
for
a
oneoff
st
patricks
day
specialty
much
better
for
the
occasion
than
drinking
miller
lite
with
green
foodcoloring
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
irish
dry
stout
i
really
love
this
beer
a
lot
and
definitely
plan
on
getting
it
again
in
the
near
future
nice
thick
fluffy
head
with
slightly
larger
bubbles
than
some
in
this
category
but
still
leaves
a
nice
lacy
residue
defiantly
a
nice
kind
of
roasted
or
nicely
toasted
smell
and
taste
which
i
love
very
evenly
balanced
in
flavor
reminds
me
of
guinness
extra
stout
but
without
the
burnt
bitter
or
even
sour
taste
also
i
would
like
to
mention
that
this
beer
is
lighter
feeling
and
not
as
syrupy
and
thick
overall
a
great
choice
for
a
no
bullsht
irish
stout
after
all
it
is
a
world
beer
champion
the
bodys
good
and
its
not
too
heavy
considering
its
not
the
americanized
idea
of
the
style
but
sticks
to
the
original
blueprint
as
it
were
it
is
quite
dry
though
the
leaf
and
chalk
build
up
in
the
back
of
the
throat
with
time
that
lingers
to
some
effect
upon
the
initial
pour
this
beer
appeared
to
be
a
strongheavy
stout
it
has
a
semi
strong
coffee
scent
but
not
overbearing
the
taste
is
lighter
then
many
other
stout
i
have
tried
and
there
is
a
much
more
carbonated
mouth
feel
then
you
would
expect
from
a
stout
easy
to
drink
with
a
definite
chocolate
hint
to
its
flavor

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
quality
of
roast
through
its
flavoring
and
its
aroma
while
neither
was
a
blow
away
they
both
kept
the
drinker
interested
and
although
they
werent
very
deep
and
complex
they
did
just
offer
enough
of
that
drying
fire
and
soft
smokiness
in
comparison
the
feel
was
on
the
thin
side
and
generally
unremarkable
we
were
waiting
for
a
table
here
to
eat
and
standing
at
the
bar
this
one
caught
our
eye
in
a
cooler
otherwise
filled
with
your
typical
asian
offerings
so
for
that
purpose
to
kill
time
while
chatting
with
friends
it
served
its
purpose
well
but
even
still
might
not
be
our
first
recommendation
to
someone
looking
for
something
on
the
darker
side
of
the
equation
had
this
one
on
tap
at
ashleys
in
ann
arbor
pours
black
with
medium
sized
cream
colored
head
light
bodied
stout
very
dry
not
a
lot
of
flavor
to
speak
of
here
faint
roasted
grain
really
not
much
going
on
relatively
light
medium
high
carbonation
better
than
guinness
but
not
by
much
overall
a
great
brew
by
abc
and
one
i
would
certainly
order
again
looks
great
with
a
head
that
allows
you
to
pour
the
entire
bottle
at
once
into
a
pint
glass
the
smell
is
cocoa
with
the
aftertaste
from
the
last
sip
dominating
the
taste
is
nice
i
normally
prefer
sweet
or
american
stouts
but
this
is
a
good
change
of
pace
the
balance
is
good
but
it
does
have
more
bitterness
than
the
stouts
i
prefer
if
youre
going
to
drink
an
irish
dry
stout
this
is
a
great
one
to
the
point
a
nice
irish
stout
i
found
it
easy
to
enjoy
i
have
always
thought
that
irish
stouts
should
just
be
called
black
beer
this
is
a
nice
stout
there
is
a
good
roastedsmoked
tone
that
is
just
a
hair
about
subtle
that
stays
consistent
throughout
hearty
body
might
be
a
bit
too
heavy
for
this
style
honestly
its
still
a
good
beer
though
im
not
sure
if
it
really
fits
to
style
too
heavy
in
body
too
much
carbonation
tastebig
roasty
flavoranise
dark
chocolate
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
flavor
and
drinkability
stouts
arent
my
first
or
second
choice
but
i
received
this
on
trade
pours
dark
and
kinda
scares
me
in
an
i
dont
like
dark
beer
kind
of
way
with
a
moderate
to
low
and
fleeting
head
prominent
lacing
this
is
a
dry
stout
and
the
first
taste
of
this
is
not
overly
malty
thinish
in
a
refreshing
kind
of
way
with
roasted
notes
and
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
and
light
malt
nose
is
malt
and
coffee
notes
mostly
to
me
mouthfeel
is
substantial
but
not
meaty
and
some
dryness
perceived
overall
i
was
prepared
to
maybe
not
even
finish
this
but
in
the
end
i
found
i
liked
this
more
than
i
anticipated
im
not
sure
this
converts
me
to
brews
with
loads
of
roasted
muscle
but
i
finish
this
and
thank
my
friend
for
the
experience
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
again
either
not
too
shabby
let
this
one
warm
up
to
cellar
temperature
it
is
a
must
a
little
rustic
and
not
as
dry
as
expected
a
decent
quaff
nice
nose
of
roasted
barley
taste
is
bold
black
malt
with
plenty
of
scorched
sugar
but
not
at
all
sweet
light
body
and
a
watery
refreshing
mouthfeel
no
hint
of
sweetness
very
grainy
and
more
than
a
hint
of
charcoal
tastes
like
a
light
black
irish
stout
to
me
less
head
than
you
might
want
very
long
bitterness
to
finish
quite
hoppy
d
overall
good
drink
easy
to
go
down
and
washes
flavors
away
with
a
dry
espresso
taste
i
recommend
to
others
and
makes
a
nice
dessert
beer
this
was
much
better
than
the
saranac
irish
stout
i
had
before
it
my
bottle
was
certainly
better
than
the
previous
reviews
would
indicate
it
was
so
promising
and
then
the
first
sip
ugh
drink
it
up
and
move
on
to
something
better
o
a
solid
beer
in
my
book
not
going
to
seek
it
out
per
se
it
is
something
id
put
in
my
stout
rotation
a
good
gloomy
day
drinker
as
there
was
a
light
drizzle
outside
while
i
had
this
one
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
picture
it
as
a
good
accompanyment
to
a
stew
or
maybe
the
baked
potato
soup
that
was
going
in
the
crockpot
much
more
than
this
beer
much
much
more
overall
id
have
it
again
but
i
wont
miss
it
once
its
gone
i
am
drinking
a
3
year

form
the
palate
it
is
very
smooth
creamy
and
surprisingly
light
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
billed
as
a
stout
but
tasted
more
like
a
lager
with
some
caramel
malt
pretty
drinkable
some
nice
flavor
but
not
the
big
stout
flavor
i
was
expecting
overall
not
very
exciting
semidry
and
medium
bodied
the
ale
closes
with
a
sense
of
lightness
dangerously
close
to
watering
light
acrid
char
and
campfire
bitterness
close
the
session
even
as
colanut
flavors
persist
in
aftertaste
thin
even
at
4
5
lots
of
bitterness
which
is
not
quite
balanced
by
the
complexity
of
flavor
belgian
stouts
often
have
a
unique
take
but
theres
nothing
special
going
on
here
there
are
a
thousand
english
beers
like
this
ok
maybe
not
quite
so
lean
and
roasty
enjoyable
and
surprisingly
relatively
light
just
not
amazing
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
but
still
not
quality
stuff
theres
that
little
twang
of
something
that
just
lends
to
the
credence
that
it
is
not
a
quality
brew
a
bitterness
like
from
a
corn
or
something
not
really
worthy
its
got
a
certain
earthiness
which
just
seems
to
follow
other
brews
of
that
arent
great
i
guess
its
decent
for
a
drink
but
im
not
buying
it
again
especially
for
the
price
a
pretty
well
made
medium
stout
you
can
keep
looking
for
some
complexity
in
the
taste
and
can
find
it
i
enjoyed
it

not

if

the
style

say
very

nice

poured
from
a
330ml
bottle

brown
theres
not
too
much
to
the
nose
light
roasted

notes
and
little
bit
of
fruit
unremarkable
taste
is
similar
to
that
of
a
wellmade
porter
though
maybe
a
little
on
the
lightbodied
side
its
roasty
and
smoky
with
good
carbonation
a
good
session
beer
for
those
who
like
dark
brews
black
with
tan
head
starting
at
two
fingers
and
then
fading
quickly
dark
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
with
a
sort
of
bitter
astringent
smell
as
well
after
a
while
it
takes
on
a
wet
dog
smell
which
i
cant
say
is
good
i
get
a
lot
more
chocolate
drinking
it
than
with
the
aroma
the
malt
is
really
roasty
almost
burntlike
theres
a
slight
hint
of
bitter
coffee
but
thats
all
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
the
finish
is
dry
like
an
irish
stout
should
be
but
i
think
there
is
way
too
much
carbonation
in
this
i
want
it
to
glide
down
my
throat
smoothly
but
instead
my
tongue
is
assaulted
by
co2
i
think
this
could
have
been
an
excellent
stout
but
the
carbonation
takes
a
lot
away
from
it
in
my
opinion
o
overall
a
solid
stout
out
of
belgium
have
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
actually
impressively
multidimensional
for
a
4
5
stout
the
chocolate
flavor
builds
a
lot
with
time
and
some
warmth
but
the
yeast
still
shines
best
example
of
the
style

have
tried

a

not
something
i
need
to
revisit
poured

the

its
an
interesting
smelling
stout
the
taste
follows
the

with

the

give
some

a

o
having
tried
a
fair
few
this
is
hands
down
the
best
session
stout
ive
ever
had
i
hate
the
fact
this
isnt
widespread
on
nitro
because
it
would
whipe
the
floor
with
the
watery
cold
lowgrade
coffee
that
a
lot
of
people
think
typify
the
genre
as
a
relatively
cheap
session
beer
this
is
quite
simply
glorious
something
you
could
and
probably
would
drink
all
night
every
night
absolutely
amazing
and
another
great
effort
from
the
people
at
de
la
senne
who
are
rapidly
rising
to
wellearnt
superstar
status
here
in
belgium
note
had
this
beer
to
celebrate
metter98s
birthday
since
he
is
an
enjoyer
of
stouts
and
his
name
is
erik
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
the
belgian
yeast
makes
the
taste
a
little
more
interesting
when
compared
to
other
irish
dry
stouts
o
really
glad
i
tried
this
one
fun
and
easy
drinking
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
bottle
of
this
in
a
second
beer
is
medium
in
body
light
on
the
finish
mildly
bitter
from
the
roast
otherwise
it
is
just
a
stout
well
made
and
id
have
it
again
but
nothing
special
here
notes
tasty
drinkable
and
a
very
good
dry
finish
tops
it
off
well
and
a
good
one
to
pick
up
cheers
o
nice
for
the
style
though
its
not
my
favorite
you
can
always
tell
when
i
explicitly
grade
to
style
if
i
ever
wanted
this
type
of
heavyhanded
roasty
light
bodyabv
stout
id
pick
up
another
stouterik
overall
simple
solid
well
done
guessing
it
probably
costs
a
pretty
penny
in
the
states
and
as
such
might
have
influenced
the
reviews
i
read
enjoy
this
with
buffalo
wings
or
a
cheesy
dip
on
its
own
stouterik
does
not
hold
up
but
as
a
beverage
for
monday
night
football
it
will
be
fine
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
good
light
tan
head
and
some
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
carries
distinctive
belgian
yeast
along
with
some
chocolate
and
roast
flavor
hits
on
the
roast
and
chocolate
with
yeast
and
fruit
in
the
background
some
light
spice
medium
body
with
a
semidry
finish
pretty
good
this
is
good
but
far
from
the
best
belgian
stout
ive
tried
overall
decent
but
nothing
i
would
be
dying
to
try
again
for
the
price
ill
definitely
pass
i
can
have
much
tastier
sessions
for
a
third
of
the
price
this
is
one
light
beer
perfect
for
today
since
it
is
97f
outside
but
i
wouldnt
really
seek
this
one
out
this
one
could
be
a
beginners
foray
into
craft
beer
or
even
the
stout
style
rather
boring
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
for
the
strength
light
bodied
but
nice
mild
caramel
from
the
malt
and
light
earthy
elements
that
seem
to
blend
with
the
hops
well
slightly
piney
and
mild
pepper
from
the
hops
which
actual
are
more
dominant
from
mid
taste
on
i
thought
this
was
decent
overall
not
great
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
this
style
but
i
dont
think
this
has
a
lot
of
stoutlike
more
of
a
slightly
hoppy
brown
it
is
drinkable
though
poured
black
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
retained
and
laced
fairly
well
roasty
malts
and
cocoa
on
the
nose
and
a
surprising
mild
hop
presence
smooth
malts
in
the
taste
cocoa
and
coffee
providing
a
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
finish
thats
probably
what
i
detected
in
the
smell
and
not
hops
medium
bodied
for
a
stout
a
little
thin
but
still
easily
drinkable
even
if
not
the
best
of
its
style
this
was
a
very
light
beer
for
a
stout
i
must
agree
with
some
of
the
comments
below
saying
it
looks
like
a
dark
wheat
beer
the
head
is
rather
large
and
does
coat
the
glass
nicely
i
expected
this
stout
to
have
a
much
darker
body
to
it
and
a
ton
more
flavor
to
it
the
brews
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
on
the
lighter
side
not
as
heavy
as
most
stouts
in
the
realm
i
know
most
irish
stouts
are
on
the
lighter
side
too
but
since
this
came
from
belgium
i
was
thinking
perhaps
it
would
have
been
amped
up
with
something
a
little
more
interesting
wouldnt
need
to
have
this
one
again
the
foam
was
dark
wheat
in
color
thick
semismooth
and
very
lacy
the
color
was
a
dark
burgandy
and
semiopaque
the
smell
was
wheaty
at
best
with
some
fruity
and
bitter
accents
with
some
nutty
undertones
it
had
a
stong
bready
taste
with
a
malty
undertone
and
some
nutty
accents
mouthfeel
medium
to
heavy
bodied
and
smooth
drinkability
other
than
the
semisweet
accent
i
had
an
ok
session
d
a
well
made
drinkable
stout
well
worth
checking
out
i
am
a
big
fan
of
rich
imperial
stouts
so
lets
see
how
one
stands
up
with
lower
abv
than
usual
stouterik
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
white
heading
light
earthy
notes
comes
forth
from
the
smell
as
well
as
cocoa
milk
and
caramel
milk
chocolate
comes
in
the
front
of
the
flavor
followed
by
a
hint
of
char
and
bitter
coffee
think
cafe
con
leche
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
for
a
stout
not
something
one
sees
very
often
drinkability
is
superb
even
sessionable
in
many
respects
talk
about
a
stout
that
is
pushing
the
boundaries
in
the
opposite
direction
of
most
rather
than
high
abv
and
exotic
ingredients
de
la
senne
succeeds
with
a
low
alcohol
stout
that
is
complex
enough
on
its
own
a
must
try
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
for
any
self
proclaimed
stout
lover
out
there
jet

with
small
brown

exceptionally
drinkable
dry
stout
medium
bodied
and
very
enjoyable
d
i
really
liked
this
one
its
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
style
with
a
belgian
twist
a
light
abv
makes
for
a
session
in
the
winter
but
a
tad
pricy
for
the
outcome
which
does
not
deter
from
the
beer
great
stuff
from
a
brewery
i
need
to
drink
more
from
d
easy
on
the
abv
and
full
of
flavor
nice
stuff
for
sure
wow
really
that
is
a
much
lower
abv
than
i
expected
this
is
a
pleasant
suprise
a

the
feel
is
grainy
like
sweet
and
quite
dry
this
is
not
particularly
malty
stout
its
salty
and
has
a
lingering
oyster
shell
quality
one
of
the
dark
beers
that
i
you
say
goes
well
with
shellfish
palate
of
chalk
mineral
bitterness
and
and
mild
sweetness
of
leeks
hunger
inducing
salty
quite
lean
feel
a
nice
belgian
twist
the
nose
is
pretty
excellent
moderate
roasted

a
mellow
creaminess
and
a
definite
belgian

character
are
all
present
i
almost
wonder
if
a
beer
brewed
with
the
second
runnings
from
black
albert
will
smell
like
this
the
yeast
is
present
as
a
spicy
character
a
little
cinnamon
sugar
like
moderately
sweetened
chocolate
is
rather
prominent
here
and
swirling
the
glass
brings
up
some
coffee
too
pretty
excellent
the
palate
opens
with
a
prominent
dry
roasty
bitterness
moderately
grainy
quite
dry
theres
no
real
sweetness
here
cocoa
a
little
coffee
and
some
roast
are
all
present
as
expected
and
the
yeast
character
is
solid
too
mildly
spicy
theres
also
a
light
fruitiness
present
drying
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
has
a
moderatehigh
level
of
carbonation
the
finish
has
a
lingering
coffee
grounds
bitterness
coupled
with
some
roasted
malt
bitterness
one
of
the
driest
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
this
is
very
very
drinkable
perfectly
sessionable
a
good
not
great
dry
stout
that
would
be
a
good
lunchtime
drink
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
because
of
the
amount
of
flavor
packed
into
this
low
abv
offering
highly
recommended
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
paying
4
a
bottle
for
this
one
again

there
are

good

even

i
think
this
is
a
tasty
version
of
a
stout
and
at
4
5
it
has
alot
of
the
taste
elements
of
stronger
belgian
ales
yet
is
sessionable
packs
alot
of
flavor
that
stronger
ales
are
noted
for
but
with
considerably
less
alcohol
on
the
brewers
and
distributors
websites
this
beer
is
described
as
a
pure
version
of
a
classic
belgian
stout
made
by
brewers
who
are
dedicated
to
making
beers
using
old
traditions
this
style
of
beer
is
often
altered
to
make
it
more
widely
appealing
using
cheap
methods
such
as
nitrogenation
or
adding
spices
i
value
the
purity
of
their
approach
which
to
me
is
evident
in
the
taste
just
as
it
is
when
i
have
an
orval
this
one
needs
to
be
resampled
to
be
fully
appreciated
it
was
a
pleasant
experence
but
still
left
a
little
to
be
desired
poured
with
a
rather
large
bubbly
head
very
creamy
in
appearance
with
a
burnt
light
brown
look
dark
coffeecolored
appearance
but
the
head
dominates
even
with
its
lacking
lacing
aromas
have
a
decent
mix
of
cream
toffee
coffee
burnt
sugars
taste
has
more
of
an
acidic
bitter
fruit
taste
to
it
mixed
with
a
milky
cream
like
you
can
see
in
this
review
the
creamy
aspect
is
a
plus
to
this
drink
but
its
not
overpowering
or
too
offbalanced
overall
decent
d
this
beer
has
a
pretty
thin
flavor
with
some
interesting
qualities
and
a
unique
hop
profile
this
beer
intrigued
me
but
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
to
many
of
them
this
beer
pours
black
with
ruby
highlights
to
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
an
offwhite
12
finger
head
sits
on
top
with
decent
head
retention
and
wispy
lacing
that
is
left
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
thick
with
caramel
and
roasted
malts
there
is
also
a
touch
of
smokiness
and
roasted
coffee
notes
taste
is
of
the
roasted
and
caramel
malts
and
the
burntroasted
coffee
touches
of
molasses
in
the
taste
with
a
mild
smokey
flavoring
mouth
is
slightly
chewy
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
moderate
to
high
carbonation
lighter
bodied
than
most
stouts
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
stout
especially
with
the
abv
on
it
active
carbonation
sharp
medlight
body
easily
drinkable
in
just
about
any
weather
which
is
unusual
very
thin
in
the
mouth
for
a
dry
stout
with
little
malt
backbone
evident
without
a
maltiness
to
bring
it
together
the
burnt
coffee
and
smoky
taste
perhaps
a
hint
of
tobacco
are
left
sort
of
hanging
isolated
and
limp
really
is
reminiscent
of
coffee
that
has
been
brewed
too
weakly
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
alcohol
is
light
comparitively
thus
welcoming
a
second
round
okay
why
not
good
but
could
even
be
better
with
a
little
more
body
to
bring
balance
to
the
dry
taste
of
roast
malt
picked
up
a
bottle
at
liquor
world
in
porter
sq
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
dark
brown
color
heavyset
white
head
carbonation
really
only
noticeable
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
glass
decent
amount
of
lacing
smelled
like
a
lot
of
roasted
barely
with
a
sprinkle
of
milk
chocolate
taste
was
good
not
great
cocoa
powder
and
coffee
dominate
didnt
blow
me
away
though
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
but
i
have
noticed
that
trend
from
other
belgian
stouts
very
easy
to
drink
low
abv
a
bit
on
the
boring
side
though
but
good
for
one
to
enjoy
final
note
the
website
says
this
stout
was
inspired
by
the
irish
style
but
the
belgian
in
it
is
still
more
prevalent
a
nice
brew
on
its
own
a
decent
offering
better
than
average
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
the
aroma
is
definitely
a
bit
more
interesting
complex
than
the
flavor
though
i
like
that
it
is
dry
and
it
could
almost
pass
for
a
ordinary
dry
stout
if
not
for
that
hint
of
fermentation
character
that
makes
this
a
little
something
extraordinary
far
more
espressolike
than
the
smell
would
indicate
relatively
thin
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
the
finish
is
like
the
end
of
a
dark
coffee
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
thin
coffeecolored
foam
head
aroma
consists
of
strong
maltiness
chocolate
plum
and
raisin
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
smooth
taste
consisting
of
hints
of
dark
chocolate
broasted
malt
and
dark
fruits
d
a
really
terrific
stout
i
recall
being
very
impressed
with
the
taste
i
had
of
this
at
portland
intl
beerfest
this
summer
a
little
overbittered
for
my
liking
but
definitely
one
to
recommend
to
fans
of
the
dry
stout
style
would
certainly
have
again
this
is
a
pretty
solid
dry
stout
which
i
definitely
enjoyed
different
than
a
typical
irish
stout
and
i
like
it
definitely
worth
a
try
d
im
not
really
a
fan
i
think
there
is
a
chemical
charecter
that
comes
through
in
this
beer
i
dont
know
what
would
cause
this
but
it
just
felt
flat
and
had
an
odd
aftertaste
bottle
poured
a
light
dark
color
ale
with
a
huge
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
light
bitter
roasted
malt
is
somewhat
interesting
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
light
roasted
malt
and
some
light
hops
presence
good
carbonation
but
body
is
a
bit
thin
as
previous
raters
mentioned
this
beer
seems
to
be
geared
toward
drinkability
and
might
lack
some
character
a
very
drinkable
stout
for
sure
and
the
modest
alcohol
can
only
help
its
a
stout
but
no
irish
stout
drinkability
is
very
highim
not
particularly
fond
of
stouts
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
maybe
it
just
got
me
on
the
right
night
recommended
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
paying
4
a
bottle
for
this
one
again
when
i
could
use
that
to
buy
an
orval
or
something
else

my
taste

despite
all
of
the
porter
styled
burntbitterness
going

here
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
and
a
quite
a
nice
little
surprise
to
bring
home
from
west
lakeview
liquors
the
bottle
says
this
is
a
brussels

wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
turns
out
its
just
a
good
sessionable
stout
stouterik
is
a
wellbrewed

that
is
more
conventional
than
expected
unfortunately
the
price
of
admission
i
paid
4

for
the
11
2
oz
bottle
is
too
steep
to
warrant
a
repeat
purchase
given
the
cost
i
suggest
adding
another
two
or
three
bucks
and
leaving
with
a
sixer
of
some
good
american
stout
or
porter
d
this
is
a
solid
stout
offering
from
belgium
solid
coffee
flavor
really
drives
it
in
general
dnotes
this
is
the
first
export
stout
i
have
reviewed
based
on
this
one
it
seems
that
they
are
substantially
lighter
than
other
stout
styles
easy
drinking
except
for
carbonation
this
is
a
very
fine
stout
it
pours
a
very
dark
black
slightly
frothy
head
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
chocolate
burnt
malts
and
some
coffee
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
burnt
malts
and
chocolately
flavor
there
maybe
some
coffee
here
as
well
but
the
coffee
dissipates
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
the
beer
is
decently
carbonated
but
what
makes
this
a
nice
warming
drink
is
the
medium
bodied
consistency
throughout
there
are
plenty
of
hops
which
balances
out
the
burnt
notes
quite
nicely
you
will
enjoy
a
warming
aftertaste
as
well
you
cant
go
wrong
here
lchaim
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
although
i
think
the
flavours
could
all
do
with
being
beefed
up
a
bit
recommended
the
dryness
takes
a
bit
of
getting
use
to
but
once
its
flow
has
started
to
take
place
its
easy
to
follow
a
nice
surprising
find
and
will
go
back
for
more
o
man
this
is
killer
dry
irish
stouts
arent
usually
knocking
my
socks
off
but
this
absolutely
does
pours
black
with
a
halffinger
of
creamy
tan
head
frozen
in
time
it
has
a
milk
chocolate
smell
with
toasted
oats
pecans
and
cream
but
i
only
pick
up
on
those
flavors
if
i
stretch
myself
its
all
rather
subtle
the
taste
brings
cocoa
powder
coffee
burnt
toast
and
bitter
hops
it
goes
down
silky
smooth
with
a
super
dry
finish
and
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
in
body
o
im
such
a
sucker
for
stouts
on
nitro
pour
so
my
rating
is
a
bit
overly
generous
still
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
nitro
pour
or
normal
overall
very
nice
dry
stout
and
i
love
the
pun
o
this
is
a
great
sessionable
stout
the
thin
body
bothered
me
a
bit
but
this
was
overall
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
is
a
fully
opaque
black
in
color

with
about
s
half
inch

milk

mild
coffee

cocoa
body
is
a

thin
but
the
nitro
gives
this
one
an
incredibly
smooth
mouthfeel
moderate
bitterness
another
quality
beer
from
ccb
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
very
slick
and
easy
to
drink
with
exactly
the
flavors
i
wanted
not
exactly
a
traditional
irish
stout
but
for
what
it
is
i
highly
recommend
it
at
least
on
nitro
o
ok
a
decent
if
not
somewhat
watered
down
example
of
the
style
just
not
amazing
on
nitro
at
the
brand
new
brass
tap
in
gainesville
awesome
creamy
kahki
head
on
top
of
a
pure
black
pour
smells
like
chocolate
syrup
and
not
much
else
yum
super
smooth
drinking
but
a
little
watery
for
me
dry
finish
and
easy
drinking
not
much
flavor
besides
some
vague
roasted
malt
here
which
is
unfortunate
after
the
incredible
aroma
wondering
if
they
accidentally
poured
guinness
though
i
know
this
is
a
dry
stout
i
just
expected
a
bit
more
flavor
on
this
one
not
bad
but
meh
o
easily
one
of
the
finest
nitro
beers
ive
had
one
of
the
best
irish
dry
stouts
beats
the
everloving
shit
out
of
guinness
i
want
this
beer
to
be
available
year
round
across
the
planet
so
people
can
use
this
as
a
marker
for
the
style
mediumbodied
at
best
slightly
watery
throughout
strong
effervescence
in
the
middle
after
a
lighter
start
and
a
nice
finish
flavor
is
pretty
good
but
i
would
like
more
heft
to
it
and
a
bit
more
balance
in
the
nose
high
drinkability
i
am
not
sure
about
the
alcohol
content
as
it
is
unknown
but
it
seems
relatively
low
meaning
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
overall
good
beer
overall
this
would
be
great
on
a
cool
afternoon
give
it
a
try
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
irish
stout
smooth
easy
to
drink
with
nice
flavor
the
beer
is
dark
brown
nearing
black
the
head
is
thick
and
beige
and
leaves
some
random
lacing
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
offers
dark
fruit
smoke
and
roast
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
eight
ounces
down
this
is
likely
the
best
irish
stout
i
have
yet
had
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
with
spot
on
carbonation
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
original
review
posted

when
it
was
still
called
patio
tools
overall
this
is
likely
in
my
top
three
ccb
beers
ive
had
and
thats
among
some
stout
company
a
very
flavorful
low
abv
stout
thats
well
worth
a
shot
o
expected
more
flavor
depth
on
this
one
but
i
guess
it
was
intended
for
easy
drinking
after
working
in
the
yard
or
while
grilling
outside
to
that
end
its
just
fine
just
not
my
thing
one
positive
is
that
it
would
be
an
easy
dark
beer
for
noncraft
beer
enthusiasts
to
enjoy
overall
a
very
nice
beer
from
cc
serving
type
ontap
taste
is
bitter
roasted
grains
elements
of
coffe
and
bitter
chocolate
peek
through
a
light
body
very
drinkable
a
really
nice
traditional
style
from
ccb
overall
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
want
a
lot
of
glad
i
got
to
try
this
now
that
i
am
done
with
my
review
i
am
headed
to
the
patio
but
not
to
be
a
tool
decent
drinkability
i
would
like
to
taste
this
beer
on
nitro
sometime
too
guys
overall
this
is
just
excellent
for
a
style
that
often
isnt
that
exciting
supremely
drinkable
this
probably
wont
surprise
most
of
you
but
i
had
this
next
to
a
guinness
and
it
was
not
even
close
the
guinness
was
way
sweeter
and
less
dry
more
watery
and
just
less
flavorful
in
general
goes
to
show
how
good
this
beer
is
for
the
style
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
and
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
cigar
city
ive
had
to
this
point
overall
a
very
nice
and
light
little
stout
i
would
have
no
issue
with
polishing
off
multiple
glasses
in
fact
the
growler
was
gone
in
about
45
mins
really
very
nicely
done
and
something
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
d
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
nice
subdued
coffee
taste
to
it
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
with
the
low
abv
had
again
two
months
later
at
the
brewery
more
coffee
grounds
and
yes
dry
although
i
felt
that
certain
aspects
needed
to
be
fine
tuned
this
brew
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
an
original
take
on
a
muchmimicked
style
poured
ontap
at
the
cigar
city
brewing
tasting
room
in
tampa
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
jet
black
coloring
looking
like
motor
oil
in
a
glass
no
head
the
beer
has
coffee
aromas
with
a
light
and
slight
smokiness
the
flavor
is
light
coffee
initially
with
a
huge
blast
of
campfire
smoke
at
the
end
aftertaste
is
all
smoke
with
a
slight
coffee
bittering
the
beers
finish
is
a
moutful
of
campfire
coals
great
dry
and
light
bodied
bravo
moved
this
over
from
a
bad
merge
the
original
review
as
made
on
31510
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
that
shows
that
cigar
city
can
make
great
regular
beers
othis
is
an
impressive
and
fair
example
of
the
style
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
every
time
i
am
satisfied
its
a
much
more
versatile
stout
that
most
a
lot
of
flavor
from
the
abv
beer
is
a
little
thin
but
has
a
nice
late
bitterness
to
it
mildly
sweet
on
the
front
and
a
decent
finish
a
simple
beer
but
done
well
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
drinkability
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
it
has
good
flavor
and
the
purportedly
low
alcohol
is
definitely
appreciated
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
bodied
for
an
irish
dry
and
has
the
excellent
drying
on
the
end
thats
the
hallmark
of
the
style
the
drinkability
suffers
just
a
little
bit
for
an
irish
dry
for
something
thats
usually
a
bit
lighter
bodied
and
easier
to
drink
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
doesnt
go
down
as
fast
as
some
in
the
style
a
very
good
beer
that
im
excited
to
see
bottled
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
slight
tan
tight
head
smells
of
coffee
and
dark
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
great
its
tough
to
describe
but
tight
come
to
mind
probably
the
dryness
of
it
also
get
notes
of
coffee
with
a
slight
smooth
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
chalkboard
said
this
was
5
2
abv
which
was
perfect
love
this
beer
d
very
nice
this
is
a
really
interesting
alternative
to
the
traditional
black
brew
of
st
patricks
day
it
has
all
of
the
roasted
dryness
expected
of
a
traditional
irish
stout
but
it
has
so
much
more
depth
and
complexity
the
spicy
notes
of
coffee
and
clove
that
i
taste
are
something
much
more
interesting
that
you
would
ever
expect
to
find
in
an
actual
irish
stout
while
the
notes
of
chocolate
are
such
a
break
from
tradition
that
they
almost
seem
out
of
place
but
end
up
being
a
very
welcome
addition
despite
being
served
on
co2
the
beer
finishes
with
a
dryness
that
is
every
bit
as
profound
as
the
classic
examples
of
the
style
and
it
effortlessly
presents
a
thick
silky
body
that
those
beers
need
nitrogen
to
develop
a
really
nice
dry
stout
and
proof
that
cigar
city
can
turn
out
complex
excellent
beer
without
having
to
do
anything
extreme
serving
type
growler
d
excellent
damn
fine
stout
homerun
when
compared
to
other
stouts
of
the
same
style
o
one
of
the
strangest
and
tastiest
irish
stouts
ive
had
in
a
long
time
also
it
has
the
added
benefit
of
being
a
style
that
is
truly
a
guilty
pleasure
of
mine
would
purchase
again
if
i
was
here
and
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
otherwise
i
am
going
with
the
batch
1000
definitely
a
decent
beer
i
would
drink
again
color
is
a
very
dark
thick
brown
almost
black
1
light
caramel
color
head
that
dissipated
slowly
over
about
5
minutes
and
left
thin
lacing
smell
was
chocolate
with
some
fruity
elements
texture
was
very
thick
and
almost
creamy
which
made
it
seem
sweeter
than
it
actually
was
taste
had
overarching
chocolate
tones
with
nutty
sweet
malt
elements
of
coffee
and
a
dry
citrus
aftertaste
very
low
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
stout
flavors
are
there
but
watered
down
the
oats
make
this
beer
flow
smoothly
as
intended
the
body
is
big
enough
for
a
stout
i
would
tone
down
the
crispness
just
a
notch
had
on
tap
in
madison
wi
in
march
2013
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
there
is
a
sweet
malt
scent
the
texture
is
pretty
thin
and
light
that
is
sweet
creamy
with
hints
of
cocoa
its
fairly
decent
given
the
company
as
it
compares
pretty
similar
to
guinness
tried
it
once
but
probably
not
going
to
try
again
in
summary
a
nice
refreshing
stout
i
enjoy
drinking
this
baby
with
the
music
of
the
cranberries
playing
linger
from
the
cd
everybody
else
is
doing
it
so
why
cant
we
o
this
is
a
nice
version
of
an
irish
dry
stout
served
as
part
of
an
eight
beer
sampler
at
gc
in
slp
mn
pour
was
black
in
color
with
a
half
finger
of
medium
tan
head
weak
aroma
of
dark
roast
malt
and
oats
taste
was
roasted
malt
faint
faint
coffee
and
chocolate
oats
grain
body
and
mouthfeel
were
watery
and
light
carbonation
was
adequate
overall
this
is
absolutely
an
entry
level
stout
not
far
removed
from
ye
olde
classic
guinness
but
for
guinness
has
a
far
superior
body
and
mouthfeel
gc
did
a
pretty
good
job
on
their
stout
the
beer
poured
a
nice
rich
black
hue
very
tall
tan
head
that
exhibied
that
laced
slightly
the
initial
scent
can
carry
soy
sauce
aroma
but
then
the
toasted
malt
and
coffee
come
to
fruition
the
taste
included
roasted
and
nice
coffee
with
very
mild
chocolate
the
stout
carried
a
medium
in
body
so
so
carbonation
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
finish
overall
a
decent
stout
probably
second
favorite
poured
black
but
a
watered
down
looking
black
nice
1
inch
head
that
lingered
on
and
on
weak
smells
of
coffee
some
chocolate
and
some
malt
tasted
like
a
watered
down
under
carbonated
root
beer
a
bit
of
licorice
malt
some
roasts
and
just
the
slightest
sweet
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
extremely
light
just
slightly
carbonated
and
very
thin
overall
ill
never
get
this
again
its
almost
undrinkable
due
to
the
very
thin
mouthfeel
t
m
the
bittering
is
wellbalanced
with
what
little
sweetness
there
is
in
this
brew
its
just
that
everything
from
the
flavor
nose
and
body
seems
overly
thin
and
watery
everything
is
in
the
right
place
but
unplugged
it
needs
amplification
it
makes
me
wonder
if
the
problem
is
that
my
palate
is
becoming
jaded
from
too
many
big
beers
or
if
the
problem
is
merely
that
this
beer
is
only
average
in
quality
d
good
nice
mild
little
stout
michael
cant
thank
you
enough
for
thinking
of
me
during
your
travels
37
ibus
just
fyi
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
guiness
but
a
bit
better
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
want
a
lighter
flavored
stout
i
had
no
problem
finishing
my
mug
pours
a
black
color
one
inch
head
of
a
pale
an
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
pale
hop
fits
the
style
of
an
irish
dry
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
to
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
slight
sweet
malt
and
pale
hops
overall
a
decent
beer
but
lacking
in
body
and
aroma
another
perfectly
average
beer
from
granite
city
they
dont
like
to
go
out
on
limbs
or
take
any
chances
not
bad
not
great
the
mouth
is
soft
yet
a
bit
thin
not
a
repeater
for
me
drink
a
smooth
old
brew
for
anyone
interested
including
those
naesaying
bar
patrons
that
insist
that
they
dont
like
dark
beer
to
them
i
say
well
try
this
one
cause
it
is
entirely
drinkable
dark
black
with
a
creamy
head
an
decent
retention
smell
is
not
real
strong
but
i
could
pick
up
some
coffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
also
light
coffee
and
chocolate
nothing
extraordinary
but
decent
creamy
medium
bodied
decent
drinkability
d
this
is
i
think
maybe
their
best
offering
from
their
year
around
beers
still
nothing
special
but
an
easy
drinker
nevertheless
overall
this
beer
in
my
opinion
is
the
best
offering
this
location
has
to
offer
well
balanced
great
malt
profile
mildly
hopped
carbonated
just
right
i
think
we
have
a
winner
good
work
draft
at
cedar
rapids
with
not
too
many
micros
to
choose
from
in
iowa
i
hate
to
knock
any
stout
effort
too
strongly
but
theres
just
nothing
remarkable
about
this
beer
i
do
drink
it
fairly
often
because
we
frequent
this
location
aroma
and
flavor
are
somewhat
bland
not
unpleasant
just
not
much
of
it
dsolid
albeit
lacking
aroma
and
body
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
enough
to
enjoy
my
20
oz
pour
this
one
will
not
rock
your
world
but
hey
its
north
dakota
nothing
really
to
brag
about
but
id
have
another
appearance
is
average
dark
dark
brown
with
some
head
smell
is
weak
but
there
exists
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
possibly
some
slight
hops
as
well
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
they
are
more
prevalent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
dark
black
in
color
with
a
creamy
one
finger
head
that
stays
due
to
the
nitro
tap
small
faints
of
roasted
coffee
is
all
i
can
get
taste
was
a
let
down
very
lacking
in
flavor
only
decent
flavor
that
comes
through
is
the
roasted
coffee
this
was
a
very
watery
stout
and
definately
needs
more
flavor
overall
good
beer
the
sourness
diminished
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
not
the
best
stout
i
have
had
but
ok
sample
at
the
super
terrific
stout
tasting
on
021608
pours
nearly
black
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
disappears
quickly
minimal
lacing
is
evident
mild
roasted
coffee
and
malt
in
the
nose
medium
slick
body
with
roasted
coffee
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
the
finish
is
fairly
thin
for
a
stout
and
has
a
coffee
aftertaste
plus
a
hint
of
hops
below
average
overall
man
did
this
beer
look
good
when
it
came
it
great
head
nice
dark
color
however
after
the
smell
things
kind
of
went
downhill
it
smelled
fainlty
of
coffee
and
some
chocolate
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
however
kind
of
watery
with
malty
aftertaste
it
had
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
and
went
down
slickly
overall
not
my
favorite
stout
but
could
see
myself
ordering
it
again
in
the
future
drinkability
a
drinkable
beer
one
of
there
better
offerings
d
once
it
warms
this
became
a
much
better
beer
a
good
offering
from
granite
city
but
if
youre
in
omaha
youll
be
better
off
going
to
upstream
or
lazlos
if
this
isnt
a
guinness
clone
ill
be
damned
bitter
aroma
of
oats
chocolate
and
dark
malts
dark
brown
almost
black
body
with
a
thick
nitro
off
white
head
tastes
likeguinness
body
is
a
touch
on
the
watery
side
though
smooth
but
light
mildly
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
but
boozy
when
warm
at
least
the
nitro
tap
makes
it
creamy
smooth
and
more
drinkable
than
the
taste
alone
would
deserve
just
my
opinion
if
you
like
this
great
i
like
the
brother
benedicts
bock
a
bit
better
i
suppose
im
just
frustrated
to
live
across
the
street
from
a
brewpub
and
not
get
something
better
this
beer
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
a
nice
tight
tanlight
brown
twofinger
head
the
head
disappears
slowly
and
recedes
a
bit
leaving
a
lot
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
notes
of
roastiness
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
mild
with
a
definite
dry
roasty
flavor
that
reminds
me
just
a
bit
of
coffee
caramel
toffee
and
chocolate
come
through
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavors
are
an
interesting
mix
of
subtleties
complex
yet
subtle
subtle
yet
not
watereddown
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
medium
body
with
a
creaminess
helped
along
by
the
nitro
overall
a
very
drinkable
dry
stout
ive
got
to
admit
that
this
one
surprised
the
heck
out
of
me
i
expect
good
beer
from
granite
city
but
not
necessarily
great
beer
regardless
this
beer
is
very
good
color
me
impressed
overall
the
simple
taste
profile
has
a
classic
background
setting
and
misses
nothing
the
airy
nature
of
this
one
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
dry
stout
this
pairs
extremely
well
with
the
vodka
steamed
mussels
in
tomato
sauce
butter
and
garlic
with
the
ciabatta
bread
nice
this
came
with
a
big
foamy
deeptanlightbrown
head
the
nose
had
a
lot
of
roasty
coffee
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
due
to
the
pour
there
was
a
good
bit
of
cocoa
on
the
tongue
with
the
finish
an
interesting
mix
of
coffee
and
a
light
smokiness
one
was
plenty
though
when
faced
with
the
prospect
of
going
back
into
the
kansas
sun
103
f
that
day
i
have
to
give
this
an
average
rating
on
drinkability
because
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
when
i
wanted
a
stout
either
something
isnt
right
about
this
batch
or
someone
needs
to
go
hit
these
people
over
the
head
with
a
bottle
of
irelands
or
even
americas
finest
drinkability
if
you
enjoy
drinking
multiple
nitrogenated
stouts
in
a
session
this
is
a
good
candidate
a
smooth
and
creamy
stout
unfortunately
its
lacking
on
taste
and
aroma
theres
some
chocolate
and
roasted
barely
in
there
but
its
lost
behind
the
creamy
body
looks
and
feels
great
but
just
doesnt
have
enough
in
the
flavor
department
give
this
to
someone
who
likes
guinness
or
likes
creamy
lowflavored
beers
upon
my
fourth
or
fifth
visit
to
the
wonderful
granite
city
establishment
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
one
of
the
standard
offerings
available
on
cask
surely
i
had
to
jump
at
the
chance
to
taste
i
will
say
this
is
one
of
the
most
handsome
brews
i
have
seen
in
some
time
it
has
a
beautiful
chocolate
colored
head
that
has
a
peppery
cloudy
look
if
there
has
every
been
a
head
that
you
just
want
to
eat
it
would
be
this
one
as
you
would
expect
the
color
of
the
beer
itself
is
dark
as
night
while
the
nose
is
strictly
limited
to
deep
cocoa
notes
not
a
bad
limitation
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
velvety
certainly
not
out
of
the
ordinary
given
the
style
and
serving
type
there
are
large
roasted
barley
flavors
on
the
forefront
while
faint
chocolate
and
coffeeish
notes
linger
an
oaken
quality
lends
that
handcrafted
feel
that
is
much
appreciated
it
finishes
a
tad
roasty
and
dry
with
that
unmistakable
corkflavored
background
smooth
and
tasty
this
is
surely
a
cask
driven
brew
the
body
was
light
and
the
carbonation
was
relatively
high
for
the
style
overall
this
could
be
a
good
beer
but
definitely
needs
more
of
strong
malt
billed
to
be
really
good
tasted
ontap

at
the
cedar
rapids
ia
location
mouthfeel
was
equally
disappointing
with
a
very
watery
thin
feel
about
it
drinkability
the
third
pint
i
have
had
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
and
the
ipa
couldnt
even
get
mr
bud
light
to
try
a
small
sampler
on
me
so
i
dont
know
how
this
one
would
be
for
the
bmc
consumer
but
i
thought
it
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
milk
chocolate
brown
opaque
slightly
lighter
in
color
than
i
expected
head
settles
quickly
to
a
tan
ring
french
roast
coffee
aroma
subtle
but
nicely
executed
and
somewhat
oily
dryish
and
light
in
mouthfeel
hard
roast
plays
off
nicely
with
a
slight
carob
and
sugar
sweetness
a
little
papery
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
little
stuffy
in
the
nose
late
in
th
eswallow
nice
texture
and
plays
pretty
wel
in
the
dry
style
this
is
a
brewpub
beer
i
would
follow
if
i
had
a
chance
to
drink
it
at
regular
intervals
this
was
a
really
nice
stout
broad
axe
stout
might
be
good
to
introduce
a
light
beer
drinker
to
the
world
of
dark
beer
but
anyone
serious
about
authenticity
should
look
elsewhere
not
horrible
just
not
much
there
to
enjoy
had
this
one
at
the
st
cloud
location
while
i
was
back
home
visiting
for
xmas
when
i
was
at
sju
we
would
come
here
every
wednesday
to
take
advantage
of
their
75
cent
taps
ahem
dark
brown
with
thick
creamy
light
tan
nitroish
head
smell
is
nutty
with
light
molasses
and
coffee
taste
is
buttery
toasty
roasted
maltiness
very
creamy
goes
down
easy
and
i
like
it
more
than
guiness
deep
black
hue
creamy
slightly
tan
head
served
small
in
size
but
what
was
presented
had
good
retention
and
as
i
sipped
away
the
beer
it
did
lace
rather
well
the
potency
in
the
nose
was
weak
it
was
served
too
cold
only
some
light
roasted
malts
found
their
way
to
my
olfactory
the
taste
profile
is
solid
smooth
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
complement
of
hops
functionally
and
agreeably
bitter
from
the
hops
and
coffee
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
smidge
too
thin
yet
this
is
a
flavorful
enough
stout
to
enjoyable
only
objection
it
was
served
too
cold
the
broad
axe
pours
a
dark
thin
black
with
a
very
wide
head
that
clings
in
patches
throughout
the
drink
somewhat
of
a
bubbly
carbonation
with
a
coffee
taste
left
on
the
palate
somewhat
dry
aftertaste
this
seems
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
for
a
stout
but
rather
drinkable
for
the
version
this
unfortunately
was
one
of
the
weaker
stouts
i
have
tasted
the
color
is
nice
and
dark
and
the
head
very
creamy
but
the
roasted
malts
take
over
as
the
only
determinable
flavor
characteristic
and
the
body
is
much
lighter
than
is

enhanced
by
being
dry

the
cloying

some

can
have
and
by
the
slight
bitterness
that
makes
you
want
to
return
to
the
glass
frequently
a
very
good
stout
o
an
average
brew
medium
thin
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
overall
mouthfeel
quite
a
good
irish
stout
that
takes
the
dry
designation
seriously
overall
while
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
nitrodry
irish
stout
it
is
nothing
too
spectacular
its
worth
a
try
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
a
finger
of
head
and
some
nice
retention
and
lacing
very
mild
nose
the
taste
is
smooth
but
very
very
thin
there
is
a
mild
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
pick
this
effort
up
out
of
the
doldrums
simply
put
bland
great
price
great
taste
and
relatively
locally
brewer
beer
could
use
a
tad
more
body
by
im
really
diggin
the
aftertaste
worth
trying
for
sure
the
very
low
abv
almost
makes
it
worthless
to
really
drink
though
really
showed
a
tremendous
amount
of
promise
dark
as
night
with
a
rich
and
creamy
tan
head
that
rose
up
from
the
bottom
and
settled
down
very
nicely
along
the
top
of
the
glass
bu
that
was
about
the
best
it
would
get
too
light
of
a
n
aroma
as
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
notes
seem
to
be
horribly
off
balance
hints
of
coffee
maybe
but
it
all
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
a
mess
for
me
to
be
honest
smooth
even
carbonation
on
a
somewhat
mellow
profile
needed
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
to
really
be
anything
worthwhile
to
me
roasted
chocolate
hints
of
tobacco
a
light
sweetness
but
again
it
really
all
seemed
terribly
off
balance
to
me
o
overall
it
does
not
have
enough
going
on
flavors
need
to
be
more
assertive
to
pull
off
the
lack
of
acidity
from
going
nitro
easily
drinkable
but
the
primary
flavor
is
the
char
which
isnt
really
satisfying
overall
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
but
nothing
stands
out
as
extraordinary
poured
into
a
signature
glass
pitch
black
with
a
finger
of
dense
creamy
tan
head
roasted
malts
in
the
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
of
more
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
coffee
for
bitterness
and
really
not
much
else
pretty
smooth
but
not
fullbodied
enough
for
a
stout
nice
and
creamy
on
nitro
though
as
long
as
the
head
lasts
fairly
drinkable
the
nitro
tap
is
always
awesome
the
beer
pours
much
like
a
guinness
draught
the
color
is
a
deep
brownish
black
with
a
really
nice
creamy
brown
head
on
it
thats
sticky
and
laces
pretty
well
the
aromas
are
lightly
roasted
slight
smooth
creamy
aromas
too
the
taste
is
very
smooth
kind
of
on
the
flat
side
but
the
nitro
makes
it
that
way
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
pretty
good
attempt
at
an
irish
stout
d
this
was
a
good
irish
stout
and
the
mouthfeel
keeps
the
body
from
being
heavy
so
its
easier
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
the
lower
abv
also
adds
to
the
drinkability
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
that
is
perfect
for
after
a
meal
or
with
some
desert
overalldynamite
irish
stout
great
sessioner
obviously
knocks
the
big
boys
out
of

park
excellent
job
d
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
ill
definitely
try
it
again
elsewhere
if
i
see
it
oreillys
irish
stout
by
sly
fox
is
pretty
much
all
one
would
ask
for
in
a
dry
irish
dry
stout
this
beer
served
on
nitrogen
carefully
poured
at
local
44
is
pitch
black
with
a
fluffy
2
5
inches
of
beige
meringue
foam
the
beer
has
just
a
faint
wisp
of
chalky
roasted
grain
this
beer
tastes
almost
perfect
it
is
plenty
dry
with
flavorful
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
roasted
flavors
the
hop
bitterness
strong
and
a
bit
surprising
considering
the
mellow
hop
flavors
in
guiness
but
it
works
well
with
the
creamy
silky
mouthfeel
accentuating
the
dryness
of
the
beer
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
at
3
6
it
is
very
easy
to
keep
going
with
it
all
night
long
the
only
thing
was
that
the
roasted
grain
and
bitterness
from
hops
made
this
just
a
bit
too
astringent
but
overall
fantastic
roasted
smokiness
with
some
chocolaty
coffee
not
bad
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
black
in
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
faint
roasty
malt
in
the
taste
grassy
and
a
small
dry
roasty
malt
a
smooth
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
bitter
aftertaste
quite
thin
and
lacking
in
flavor
and
aroma
overall
i
dont
love
this
stout
but
its
not
bad
for
a
low
abv
beer
but
i
dont
love
it
either
a
very
solid
stout
ive
been
in
the
mood
for
a
good
creamy
stout
and
now
im
very
satisfied
drinkability
maybe
a
bit
heavier
for
the
summer
days
but
definetly
on
a
nice
cool
and
cold
day
very
easy
to
put
a
few
down
d
i
ordered
this
because
it
has
a
low
abv
and
i
was
driving
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
while
good
i
dont
see
myself
having
another
but
will
get
it
from
time
to
time
having
it
off
the
nitro
tap
i
dont
see
having
it
any
other
way
would
suffice
d
i
would
be
content
w
one
since
the
roasted
flavors
and
hops
overpower
the
beer
and
nitrogen
is
not
my
favorite
form
of
delivery
this
is
just
ok
in
my
book
and
compared
to
guiness
it
is
a
toss
up
personally
i
think
for
the
abv
it
has
a
lot
going
on
taste
comes
across
as
watery
not
nearly
the
flavor
i
was
expecting
based
on
the
wonderful
aroma
easy
to
drink
but
need
a
little
more
uuuumph
one
dimensional
to
the
roasted
side
and
continues
to
have
a
watery
element
to
it

d
over
the
top
in
drinkability
relatively
light
but
nice
in
feel
and
with
good
flavors
easily
quaffed
a
good
substitute
for
guinness
though
my
friend
who
drinks
guinness
almost
exclusively
found
it
a
tad
bit
too
dry
for
his
liking
me
i
prefer
that
dryness
worth
checking
out
thats
brown
sugar
the
wet
kind
not
the
dry
kind
a
good
irish
stout
from
a
local
brewery
does
well
rich
dark
chocolate
brew
that
poured
a
hefty
head
that
lasted
the
entire
pint
nose
of
coffee
and
malts
medium
mouthfeel
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
just
a
nice
stout
it
was
served
at
room
temp
the
way
stouts
should
be
served
not
highly
recommended
normally
one
of
my
favorites
tried
this
last
weekend
at
the
blind
tiger
in
nyc
dark
brown
color
slight
head
the
smell
didnt
do
much
for
me
as
for
the
taste
it
was
a
nice
stout
but
it
had
nothing
that
really
stood
out
it
was
a
good
beer
but
it
did
not
make
me
want
to
order
another
with
so
many
choices
at
the
blind
tiger
i
was
a
bit
let
down
with
my
first
choice
oh
well
drinkability
just
bitter
enough
to
make
it
crisp
and
with
very
little
carbonation
this
becomes
a
stellar
session
beer
as
far
as
their
claim
of
beating
out
guinness
or
murphys
in
a
taste
test
well
im
not
sure
who
was
tested
but
it
certainly
wasnt
me
the
overall
drinkability
was
good
i
enjoyed
my
second
pint
more
than
the
first
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
i
would
drink
this
beer
if
i
was
in
a
bar
that
had
it
on
tap
but
probably
would
not
seek
it
out
again
in
a
growler
i
recommend
trying
it
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
d
very
good
per
style
incredibly
clean
and
smooth
going
down
while
the
style
is
not
mine
at
least
by
birth
this
is
a
brew
i
will
seek
out
every
time
i
am
home
to
visit
i
bid
you
peace
d
light
body
made
it
very
easy
drinking
but
the
lingering
aftertaste
was
a
slight
turn
off
i
was
able
to
try
this
sly
fox
brew
on
tap
at
high
street
bar
grill
on
12008
they
poured
it
into
a
sly
fox
american
pint
glass
the
beer
had
a
beautiful
jet
black
color
with
a
long
lasting
silky
1
inch
head
of
beige
foam
it
looked
good
enough
to
eat
it
had
a
faint
aroma
of
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
a
pinch
of
sweet
caramel
at
the
end
the
taste
was
dry
no
duh
with
dark
roasted
malts
a
splash
of
sweet
caramel
a
hint
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
a
pinch
of
herbs
and
then
all
of
this
ended
with
some
dried
roasted
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
dry
with
a
faint
aftertaste
of
dried
roasted
malts
and
dried
roasted
hops
even
though
the
aftertaste
was
faint
the
dryness
of
the
roasted
flavors
lingered
on
for
a
few
minutes
it
wasnt
the
best
irish
stout
ive
had
but
it
was
still
a
good
one
even
though
the
aroma
was
faint
and
it
seemed
like
the
flavors
needed
to
come
out
just
a
little
bit
more
in
fairness
i
need
to
give
this
beer
another
shot
if
it
were
the
first
beer
of
an
evening
i
am
sure
its
profile
would
have
been
different
as
it
stands
right
now
i
will
have
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
undistinguished
gave
this
brew
a
try
the
other
night
while
over
at
the
royersford
the
brew
was
served
in
a
nice
imperial
pint
glass
with
the
etching
of
oreillys
on
the
side
one
thing
that
i
must
say
is
that
they
do
a
good
job
serving
their
brews
in
the
appropriate
glassware
had
a
very
dark
black
color
with
a
think
creamy
tan
head
that
head
great
retention
and
left
a
lot
of
lacing
through
out
the
aromas
where
of
burnt
grain
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
highlights
the
flavors
seemed
to
mimic
the
aroma
highlights
but
a
coffee
bitterness
really
came
through
which
was
nice
being
mixed
with
chocolate
flavors
had
a
very
nice
creamy
feel
and
finished
dry
which
is
expected
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
would
be
excellent
on
a
cooler
evening
overall
a
very
tasty
dry
stout
a
nice
fresh
allternative
to
guinness
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
id
like
to
try
it
as
a
nonnitro
pour
i
bet
itd
accentuate
some
aromas
and
flavours
and
bring
a
fuller
overall
experience
to
this
one
still
no
complaints
about
how
this
one
pours
now
recommended
when
they
handed
this
pint
to
me
i
thought
they
poured
me
a
guinness
has
a
very
typical
dry
stout
look
and
feel
but
has
a
very
smokey
flavor
to
it
all
three
pints
i
got
of
this
beer
poured
beautifully
a
pint
of
darkness
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
gets
tired
of
leaving
rings
about
halfway
down
and
simply
coated
the
bottom
half
of
the
glass
entirely
with
foam
remarkable
retention
im
remarking
on
it
aint
i
smelled
primarily
of
roasted
and
sweet
malts
as
well
as
dark
grain
and
some
floral
and
bitter
hops
tasted
great
creamy
roasted
malt
and
barley
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
a
great
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
fantastic
i
could
have
stayed
drinking
this
beer
all
night
its
got
a
nice
body
very
creamy
going
down
and
then
it
all
dries
up
textbook
better
than
guinness
hooray
for
my
money
this
is
what
many
of
the
more
ubiquitous
irish
stouts
strive
to
be
its
got
the
deep
roasted
grain
character
nicely
balanced
by
a
bittersweet
edge
and
wellproportioned
hops
the
result
is
a
relatively
light
quickflowing
drinkable
quaff
keep
that
flavor
on
my
palate
for
jkust
a
bit
longer
and
id
drink
this
over
all
but
a
handful
of
beers
and
that
abv
wee
laddie
that
it
is
means
youre
never
going
to
want
to
oneanddone
this
brew
so
guys
maybe
well
want
to
bottle
this
one
soon
hmmm
excellent
stout
nice
dark
beer
with
an
offwhite
head
lots
of
toffee
and
coffeee
in
the
nose
the
taste
seems
watered
down
everything
you
get
in
the
nose
just
less
of
it
has
a
slight
metalic
taste
to
it
too
possibly
form
the
keg
rather
heavy
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
again
watered
down
but
still
bitter
it
poured
out
dark
with
a
thick
white
head
that
remained
almost
to
the
last
drop
the
aroma
was
full
of
roastiness
but
the
first
sip
revealed
bitter
hops
balanced
by
a
coffee
flavor
my
favorite
part
was
the
mouthfeel
a
delectable
creaminess
that
had
the
texture
of
milk
but
without
the
heavy
lactose
taste
drinkability
was
slow
for
me
by
the
time
i
drank
the
pint
dry
my
dinner
partner
was
finished
his
second
beer
this
is
a
stout
to
savor
and
enjoy
not
to
pound
served
as
dark
brown
beer
with
massive
frothy
white
head
as
would
be
expected
left
a
coating
on
the
entire
glass
as
it
was
consumed
smell
is
of
a
light
coffee
chocolate
texture
taste
is
dry
coffee
chocolate
and
very
enjoyable
finishes
with
a
good
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
bitterness
perfect
session
beer
with
perfect
drinkability
black
with
ruby
highlights
topped
by
a
very
dense
tan
head
this
beer
had
superb
retention
and
left
thick
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
gorgeous
plenty
of
roasty
dark
grain
in
the
nose
not
quite
to
the
point
of
coffee
though
some
milk
chocolate
too
mild
hop
bitterness
but
this
was
supplemented
a
bit
by
the
dark
grains
plenty
of
chocolate
and
roast
flavour
with
a
bit
of
hop
character
as
well
quite
dry
but
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
theres
some
nuttiness
as
it
warms
as
well
light
body
with
very
low
carbonation
some
creaminess
and
some
astringency
a
fine
irish
stout
an
obvious
session
beer
the
flavor
is
really
clean
and
easy
drinking
with
the

and
at

i
could
easily
drink
this
one
all
night
long
a
rich
thick
dark
brown
head
over
opaque
black
liquid
roasty
chocolatey
nose
with
flavors
of
roasted
barley
with
little
malt
sweetness
light
coffee
some
hops
very
smooth
going
down
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
as
it
seemed
very
fresh
an
unexpected
treat
to
find
it
on
tap
pours
nearly
black
not
overly
thick
as
that
wouldnt
fit
the
style
but
with
a
solid
thick
ivory
head
rich
malty
and
chocolatey
aroma
flavors
run
wild
which
is
rare
for
this
oftencopied
style
that
often
turns
out
bland
and
flavorless
especially
when
served
on
nitro
coffee
chocolate
and
big
toasted
almond
and
walnut
flavors
meld
into
an
extremely
mild
hoppy
bitter
finish
complemented
by
a
slight
sugar
sweetness
as
smooth
and
creamy
as
they
come
forget
everything
you
think
you
know
about
irish
dry
stouts
ie
guinness
though
i
do
love
her
and
try
this
its
available
in
quite
a
few
places
and
seems
to
be
more
available
than
any
other
sly
fox
offering
drinkable
by
the
bucketful
quite
a
nice
example
of
an
irish
dry
stout
nitro
pour
with
a
cascade
of
a
rich
head
of
tiny
bubbles
dark
black
color
smell
is
hard
to
make
out
in
the
bar
but
it
smelled
kind
of
roasty
for
a
3
6
dry
stout
this
has
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
roasted
malt
wtih
some
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
mouthfeel
is
typically
nitro
smooth
they
have
this
and
guiness
on
tap
at
grace
why
anyone
would
ever
choose
guiness
over
this
one
i
have
no
idea
its
nice
and
drinkable
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
not
among
the
best
stouts
ive
had
but
certainly
a
solid
beer
poured
on
a
slow
nitro
pour
into
a
imperial
pint
glass
looks
pretty
much
like
a
guinness
and
is
dark
as
night
smell
is
fairly
nonexistent
although
some
roasted
malts
are
present
taste
is
kinda
subdued
cause
of
the
nitro
but
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
bakers
chocolate
and
a
nice
clean
slightly
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
up
front
a
tad
thin
in
the
end
very
drinkable
at
only
3
6
abv
with
a
nitro
pour
i
give
them
credit
for
not
just
creating
a
generic
brewpub
stout
on
nitro
tap
at
grace
this
is
an
absolutely
amazing
dry
irish
stout
probably
the
best
one
that
i
have
sampled
thus
far
in
my
beer
tasting
exploits
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
opaque
black
in
colour
with
a
lovely
tankhaki
head
that
lasts
for
ages
the
aromas
are
awesome
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
espresso
caramel
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
more
wow
this
is
like
a
rogue
shakespeare
stout
stuffed
into
the
frame
of
a
3
6abv
dry
irish
stout
the
taste
is
roasty
with
some
lovely
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
and
awesome
drinkability
i
hear
you
ask
awesome
as
well
and
at
3
6abv
you
can
drink
this
all
night
and
not
worry
about
the
next
morning
my
first
beer
from
sly
fox
and
it
has
made
a
big
impression
drinkability
very
drinkable
as
the
flavor
is
strong
and
it
is
lighter
in
body
for
a
stout
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
black
malt
scent
it
seems
a
bit
heavy
on
roasted
and
patent
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
is
dominated
with
black
patent
and
roasted
malts
it
finishes
dry
but
with
good
mouthfeel
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
stout
it
has
a
good
malt
makeup
and
mouthfeel
many
a
brewpub
has
tried
to
emulate
the
dry
stouts
of
erins
isle
but
this
one
has
finally
pulled
it
off
its
the
perfect
dry
irish
stout
served
via
nitrogen
carbonation
and
dispense
and
it
rivals
beamish
murphys
and
guinness
theres
not
much
in
the
nose
as
to
style
but
its
soft
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
due
to
the
soft
carbonation
and
densely
creamy
head
due
to
the
nitrogen
breakout
it
doesnt
have
the
lightly
sour
tang
of
guinness
but
it
does
offers
a
touch
more
bittersweet
chocolate
than
most
which
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
unique
edge
its
roasty
with
a
thin
bit
of
malt
underneath
and
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
in
the
40
to
50
ibu
range
its
light
body
lends
to
its
drinkability
and
it
finishes
short
and
dry
an
impressive
rendition
of
the
style
and
an
excellent
end
of
the
night
beer
that
offers
alot
of
flavor
with
a
limited
alcohol
although
its
equally
at
home
as
a
session
beer
for
the
evening
quite
nice
wow
what
a
pourpours
a
pitch
black
with
a
great
creamy
head
that
leaves
some
real
nice
lacingsmells
very
dry
and
earthy
the
taste
is
dry
and
earthy
with
some
unsweetened
chocolate
under
tones
a
real
complex
dry
stoutvery
enjoyablefirst
time
tryingwil
be
sure
to
get
again
this
is
probably
the
biggest
surprise
for
me
from
sly
fox
dark
black
in
color
with
a
thick
creamy
nitro
head
aroma
is
of
roasted
coffee
taste
is
chocolate
with
some
coffee
as
well
whenever
i
order
a
dry
stout
i
never
expect
anything
more
than
guinness
but
this
was
fantastic
its
yummy
rich
thick
tan
head
dark
opaque
look
the
lasting
thick
creamy
head
does
impress
not
much
nose
to
speak
of
just
a
whisp
of
roast
in
the
back
of
the
throat
very
roasty
malty
taste
with
hints
of
expresso
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
dry
toasty
finish
left
on
the
tongue
a
solid
dry
stout
the
only
area
it
was
lacking
was
in
the
nose
pours
an
opaque
black
with
some
light
mahogany
hues
head
is
quite
creamy
and
looks
very
much
like
a
guinness
i
was
very
pleased
to
find
the
beer
to
have
a
much
more
complex
flavor
profile
than
ye
old
guin
flavors
ranged
from
a
bittersweet
chocolate
to
coffee
to
a
nice
underlying
roastiness
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
on
the
light
side
but
was
still
very
pleasing
pours
an
opaque
black
with
slight
ruby
or
mahogany
highlights
the
head
is
decent
light
tan
in
color
dense
and
very
creamy
lasts
all
the
way
through
on
the
nose
the
aroma
was
deep
roastiness
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
flavorsall
of
the
same
can
also
be
found
in
the
flavor
coffee
chocolate
roastiness
slight
bitternessmouthfeel
is
super
creamy
and
smooth
the
is
very
comparable
to
a
beamish
a
very
good
dry
stout
of
course
there
is
roast
but
there
is
some
hops
too
has
some
lacing
to
it
you
can
see
light
through
it
in
a
pint
glass
if
you
hold
it
up
to
one
a
fact
i
like
initial
taste
is
very
flat
there
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
after
taste
but
there
is
also
a
lager
or
a
metal
taste
at
the
end
too
its
alright
a
mild
yet
deceptively
complex
dry
stout
that
drinks
easily
and
satisfies
the
senses

lacks

i
could
struggle
through

so
perhaps
i
judge
too
harshly
lets
try
to
put
the
genie
back
in
the
bottle
cause
this
dont
cut
it
great
stout
great
flavor
very
drinkable
typical
dry
stout
hoppiness
up
front
but
a
pleasant
creamy
finish
the
black
hawk
stout
has
a
great
name
1
as
in
the
1
hockey
team
in
the
nhl
but
is
also
a
solid
stout
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
carries
chocolate
and
peat
the
taste
is
more
leaning
towards
espresso
the
mouthfeel
is
fuller
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
not
crave
repeat
worthy
assertive
beer
but
quite
flavorful
and
very
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
it
is
under
rated
and
definitely
i
would
drink
this
over
guinness
o
not
a
fan
really
hoppy
stouts
need
to
have
a
nice
backbone
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
not
weak
caramel
with
a
ton
of
generic
bitterness
guess
which
one
this
achieves
odecent
stout
needs
bigger
flavor
but
enjoyables
overall
this
is
my
second
goaround
with
this
beer
and
while
ive
enjoyed
it
more
this
time
it
still
doesnt
quite
hit
the
spot
its
a
beer
i
dont
mind
drinking
so
long
as
i
dont
have
to
pay
for
it
rjt
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
lightly
carbonated
mild
coffee
aroma
with
not
much
else
going
on
light
to
medium
bodied
a
bit
on
the
light
side
for
a
stout
more
coffee
notes
from
the
roasted
malt
the
low
carbonation
makes
for
a
bit
of
a
flat
feeling
on
the
tongue
all
in
all
a
very
average
stout
revised
with
25
rating
system
and
another
bottle
on
feb
2013
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
its
super
drinkable
and
even
sessionable
roasted
notes
along
with
some
sweet
chocolate
match
well
overall
drinkability
i
like
this
since
its
a
bit
different
pours
pitch
black
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
all
the
way
down
very
fine
bubbles
in
the
head
aroma
is
nice
roasted
malt
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
taste
is
good
bitterness
from
the
darker
malts
comes
through
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
as
well
slightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
lingering
bite
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
not
bad
just
not
very
different
from
many
other
stouts
low
to
medium
in
carbonation
full
body
and
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
nice
beer
for
an
end
to
a
cold
day
like
today
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
but
certainly
nothing
special
o
acceptable
for
sure
o
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
other
irish
dries
before
this
one
but
it
works
cheers
drinkability
dont
let
the
corny
label
fool
you
this
is
solid
stuff
smell
was
roasted
malt
bordering
on
smoky
taste
was
initially
creamy
and
slightly
sweet
but
roasted
malt
was
assertive
driving
underlying
chocolate
and
coffee
characteristics
a
bit
earthy
medium
body
dry
finish
an
okay
irish
stout
certainly
though
nothing
memorable
o
really
enjoyed
this
brew
very
smooth
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
flavorful
beer
the
citrusy
character
threw
me
off
a
bit
but
overall
i
enjoyed
it
o
while
the
irish
dry
stout
style
doesnt
exactly
lend
itself
to
greatness
mendocino
does
a
decent
but
not
spectacular
job
with
this
beer
overall
just
a
solid
stout
all
around
probably
would
get
a
better
score
if
i
had
any
sentimental
connection
to
it
but
i
dont
black
hawk
stout
the
bottle
says
this
award
winning
brew
is
handcrafted
to
perfection
a
premium
american
classic
from
a
pioneer
brewing
legend
o
not
a
bad
stout
pretty
middle
of
the
road
got
a
12oz
bottle
as
a
gift
probably
wouldnt
have
tried
it
otherwise
glad
i
did
though
not
sure
if
id
get
a
six
pack
of
it
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
if
the
chance
arose
o
great
stout
among
the
best
that
ive
had
for
the
price
o
very
drinkable
with
classic
stout
taste
i
got
this
in
my
beer
of
the
month
collection
and
it
is
definitely
a
solid
stout
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
o
overall
a
decent
beer
was
surprised
by
the
light
sour
dark
fruit
in
the
taste
judging
by
other
reviews
im
guessing
this
is
not
intended
though
i
kind
of
liked
it
tried
it
next
to
oharas
irish
dry
stout
on
cask
and
oharas
was
much
better
i
might
have
to
revisit
my
review
of
oharas
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
prefer
my
stouts
russian
and
imperial
but
this
one
was
actually
pretty
good
imo
much
better
than
the
guiness
and
murphys
standards
of
the
style
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
a
try
slightly
sweet
malt
taste
watery
roasted
malt
flavor
dry
on
the
finish
with
a
malty
twang
this
beer
isnt
really
worth
a
full
review
because
theres
not
much
to
describe
o
really
underrated
dry
stout
very
sessionable
overall
the
beer
has
some
very
nice
qualities
for
the
style
but
then
others
really
put
away
from
its
greatness
overall
fairly
average
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
solid
stout
good
stout
but
a
bit
too
dry
for
me
while
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
as
there
are
better
readily
available
stout
options
in
my
area
this
was
better
than
i
anticipated
dr
quite
drinkable
in
part
due
to
its
flawed
mouthfeel
i
could
session
this
all
night
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
itd
be
a
bit
better
on
nitrodraught
if
only
to
bring
out
more
cream
its
forgettable
as
a
stout
but
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
o
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
great
however
it
was
very
drinkable
and
went
down
smooth
i
would
give
this
beer
a
second
chance
my
taste
buds
are
influenced
by
my
mood
at
the
time
i
just
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
any
time
soon
overall
very
enjoyable
d
solid
easy
drinking
stout
i
would
session
this
for
sure
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
does
have
a
nice
drinkable
feel
as
you
drink
it
without
seeing
the
label
and
seeing
that
is
was
labeled
a
stout
i
would
have
thought
porter
which
confuses
me
slightly
but
none
the
less
does
have
some
nice
qualities
that
make
for
a
decent
beer
this
beer
seems
to
promise
more
but
does
not
live
up
to
the
expectations
overall
i
can
think
of
better
stout
offering
and
would
prefer
the
ris
over
this
forgettable
stout
overalljust
an
average
beer
all
around
flavors
are
pretty
subtle
and
body
is
very
thin
ill
finish
the
6er
but
will
probably
never
encounter
this
beer
again
o
although
the
look
was
nice
and
the
smell
was
interesting
the
taste
was
a
little
mellow
and
the
mouthfeel
was
too
light
and
thin
for
a
stout
mediocre
drinkability
this
beer
is
tasty
drinkable
and
affordable
it
didnt
amaze
me
but
ill
buy
it
again
ill
have
to
pair
it
with
some
dark
chocolate
some
day
wonderful
malty
stout
aroma
pours
a
thick
creamy
beige
head
that
truly
lasted
a
long
spell
gracefuly
laced
the
glass
deep
black
opaque
in
color
more
on
the
slightly
sweet
side
with
a
hint
of
hops
slight
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
quite
a
while
hence
lower
mouthfeel
score
a
very
drinkable
brew
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
frothy
tan
head
head
retention
is
great
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
too
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
coffee
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
its
all
roasted
malt
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
theres
also
a
nice
roasty
bitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
little
slick
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
i
think
this
brew
is
more
like
an
irish
style
stout
than
an
american
one
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
easy
drinking
mostly
bitter
stout
then
this
is
a
good
choice
i
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
for
1
55
and
id
certainly
consider
buying
a
6
pack
of
this
in
the
future
i
wouldnt
have
any
problem
drinking
a
sixer
of
this
in
a
session
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
not
terribly
interesting
except
for
the
noticeable
hops
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
beer
smells
about
like
i
expect
an
american
stout
to
smell
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
chocolate
malt
with
some
roasted
malt
there
are
also
some
medicinal
notes
in
the
flavor
somewhat
resembling
menthol
or
spearmint
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
a
tan
color
head
on
top
the
lacing
wasnt
too
bad
here
either
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
pleasant
roasted
aroma
coming
off
it
it
the
flavors
of
the
beer
have
some
dark
malts
coffee
and
a
touch
of
bitter
chocolate
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
i
though
could
have
been
a
little
thicker
overall
this
stout
wasnt
too
bad
a
plain
stout
but
a
really
good
one
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
on
tap
instead
of
guinness
in
every
bar
dark
and
black
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
nice
walls
of
lace
the
smell
is
of
roasted
coffee
with
some
nutty
notes
dark
chocolate
and
some
earthy
hints
caramel
laces
throughout
the
taste
is
full
of
caramel
with
hints
of
toffee
dark
cocoa
and
coffee
with
robust
roasted
malts
dominating
its
smooth
balanced
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
a
great
mild
stout
very
nice
robust
caramel
smell
mixed
with
aromas
of
coffee
and
hints
of
roasted
nuts
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
overall
not
bad
first
impression
was
really
just
the
perfect
carbonation
great
frothy
and
fluffy
mouthfeel
and
just
all
around
benefit
to
the
palate
lots
of
caramel
flavors
and
again
a
bit
of
a
smoked
hint
at
the
back
small
flavors
of
roasted
nuits
chocolate
and
hints
at
black
coffee
very
nice
but
the
mouthfeel
was
absolutly
pefect
light
balanced
a
drinkers
stout
overall
a
good
mild
craft
stout
it
is
definitely
more
characteristic
than
guinness
or
other
mass
market
stouts
but
it
isnt
a
standout
stout
either
a
good
attempt
by
the
mendocino
brewery
a
completely
inoffensive
beer
that
i
might
overlook
simply
because
i
rarely
drink
stouts
this
has
little
complexity
and
is
a
bit
thin
on
flavor
bitter
coffee
up
front
with
a
sour
twang
some
bitter
chocolate
and
seltzerlike
flavors
in
the
middle
clean
long
bitter
finish
nothing
outstanding
but
quite
average
feels
like
a
porter
a
bit
thin
bodied
for
the
style
im
ok
with
it
but
wont
get
again
one
thing
about
the
glut
of
beer
on
the
market
today
is
that
theres
a
glut
of
average
beer
on
the
market
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
stout
but
theres
nothing
very
interesting
about
it
either
its
dark
its
slightly
roasted
it
has
a
somewhat
dry
finish
it
tastes
like
coffee
and
wet
ropes
more
of
same
theres
no
harm
in
drinking
it
but
why
bother
this
stout
is
but
one
of
the
many
hohummers
you
will
drink
as
you
seek
something
better
notes
this
one
may
leave
some
die
hard
stout
lovers
wanting
more
but
it
is
decent
for
the
price
range
and
may
be
a
nice
beginner
stout
o
if
i
hadnt
burned
my
taste
buds
out
today
im
sure
this
would
be
better
but
it
lacks
some
flavor
its
kinda
week
overall
although
the
flavor
is
behind
everything
else
i
would
recommend
this
as
an
introduction
to
the
style
for
someone
new
it
truly
is
not
bad
poured
a
deep
dark
muddy
black
with
a
huge
frothy
tan
head
that
produced
some
really
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
dark
roasted
bread
malts
a
resin
hop
and
a
meaty
yeast
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
it
tasted
a
little
bittersweet
with
a
hint
of
molasses
and
chocolate
at
first
and
finished
with
a
bitter
coffee
flavor
that
had
a
strong
dark
chocolate
presence
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
very
full
in
body
and
nice
smooth
and
creamy
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
overall
this
stout
was
exceptionally
smooth
with
a
very
nice
flavor
from
beginning
to
end
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
once
in
a
while
after
dinner
or
on
a
nice
cold
night
next
to
a
fire
pit
not
a
session
beer
but
easy
drinking
the
flavor
is
again
a
little
underwhelming
with
a
dry
peppery
undercurrent
that
saps
some
of
the
flavors
better
points
spent
coffee
grounds
come
to
mind
far
too
often
thin
not
horribly
so
but
definitely
leaning
that
way
not
much
like
an
american
stout
weak
effort
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
black
with
some
dark
brown
highlights
under
light
and
a
light
tan
head
that
starts
thick
and
frothy
but
recedes
to
a
decent
half
inch
tightly
bubbled
presentation
the
beer
is
malty
on
the
nose
with
no
other
characteristics
jumping
out
the
malt
has
notes
of
molasses
and
caramel
but
very
mild
initial
flavors
are
light
and
ride
through
on
a
clean
crisp
body
there
are
flavors
heavy
on
chocolate
with
strong
backgrounds
of
coffee
and
dark
sweet
malt
well
balanced
with
bitter
and
sweet
flavors
body
is
smooth
and
crisp
at
the
same
time
never
overpowering
and
alway
complementary
of
the
flavors
the
beer
transitions
to
a
quick
smooth
and
clean
finish
the
aftertaste
is
similar
to
melting
a
chocolate
bar
in
half
a
cup
of
coffee
very
tasty
and
very
pleasant
easy
to
drink
with
almost
anything
in
terms
of
food
d
the
lack
of
a
heavy
body
makes
this
beer
quite
drinkable
compared
to
others
in
the
style
d
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
enjoyed
everything
about
it
esp
the
deep
especially
the
roasty
aroma
and
taste
i
always
have
always
will
love
this
stout
reasonably
priced
reasonably
bitter
reasonably
malty
and
just
plain
reasonable
it
may
not
be
the
most
impressive
thing
ive
ever
tasted
but
if
i
want
an
allnight
stout
which
i
often
do
this
is
my
choice
hands
down
tm
strong
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
slight
sweet
and
smoky
low
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
that
becomes
a
bit
heavy
over
time
d
apart
from
all
of
the
negatives
that
i
feel
work
against
the
intended
style
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
there
are
certainly
better
examples
of
american
stouts
that
i
would
pick
up
before
this
one
but
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
overall
a
nice
amount
of
flavors
that
stay
well
balanced
pretty
smooth
and
crisp
almost
more
of
a
dark
scottish
ale
of
some
sort
not
bad
just
a
bit
different
for
the
style
the
onedimensionality
is
not
the
problem
but
the
harsh
patent
malt
is
its
a
little
too
much
ash
my
first
from
mendecino
even
though
i
love
the
place
really
like
i
mentioned
malta
goyadragon
stout
mix
does
not
remind
me
of
a
guinnessmurphys
irish
stout
style
a
bit
disappointing
maybe
but
hardly
awful
not
a
bad
beer
really
but
by
far
not
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
had
either
i
guess
i
will
have
to
pick
up
more
to
see
if
it
is
a
really
good
one
because
this
bottle
seems
like
an
under
pressurized
reject
not
a
bad
stout
though
it
could
benefit
from
a
little
more
heft
and
backbone
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
dark
opaque
coffee
color
head
is
slightly
off
white
and
dissipates
quickly
to
a
crown
smell
is
slightly
smoked
with
the
coffee
malts
taste
is
much
the
same
with
the
similar
light
smoky
flavor
with
the
coffee
malts
feel
is
smooth
with
a
crispness
to
the
carbonation
and
a
full
body
overall
a
good
stout
the
smokiness
caught
me
a
bit
off
guard
though
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
nearly
black
light
mocha
tan
head
with
chunky
sporadic
lacing
clinging
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
muted
dark
roasted
malts
herbal
hops
and
dark
chocolate
with
hints
of
anise
flavor
contains
bitter
chocolate
roasted
malt
character
with
herbal
hops
and
a
nice
black
roasted
malt
nuttiness
about
it
finishes
like
herbal
tea
mouthfeel
is
mediumm
bodied
carbonation
is
light
but
carries
the
body
well
nothing
offensive
here
drinkability
isnt
bad
moderate
alcohol
nice
flavor
profile
this
is
something
i
could
drink
without
difficulty
notes
a
nice
stout
with
a
good
balance
quite
tasty
good
amount
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
hints
of
other
stout
flavors
overall
a
tasty
beer
and
a
good
example
of
a
basic
stout
didnt
overly
impress
me
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
overall
i
was
surprised
at
how
fruit
driven
this
beer
was
dark
roast
plays
into
secondary
flavors
mouthfeel
really
hurts
this
beer
wondering
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
one
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
drinkability
relatively
sessionable
after
reading
other
reviews
youd
expect
this
to
be
not
that
good
but
honestly
it
isnt
bad
at
all
perhaps
the
three
years
of
cellaring
this
helped
it
out
but
overall
a
pretty
good
and
sessionable
stout
overall
overall
its
a
pretty
good
stout
nice
bitterness
for
a
stout
but
didnt
have
enough
sweetness
for
me
i
wasnt
expecting
much
after
seeing
the
lack
of
head
however
it
is
a
decent
stout
that
i
could
see
myself
buying
locally
if
i
could
poured
dark
brown
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
very
thin
chestnut
head
bad
retention
and
modest
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
caramel
chocolate
and
various
nutty
flavors
the
taste
certainly
revealed
walnut
hazelnut
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
thin
finish
in
fact
much
more
thinbodied
than
expected
with
modest
carbonation
sessionable
but
still
a
little
too
thin
for
my
taste
aroma
was
unremarkable
mostly
a
slight
coffee
or
dark
chocolate
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
amber
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
not
too
thin
overall
this
tastes
much
different
than
sweeter
creamier
stouts
like
murphys
and
guinness
but
i
think
its
worth
a
try
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
light
smooth
mouthfeel
toasty
chocolate
malts
and
cream
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
coffee
finish
easydrinking
if
not
exactly
groundbreaking
its
a
good
price
pretty
accessible
without
dumbing
the
style
down
this
is
kind
of
like
your
2
or
3
starter
in
baseball
hes
gonna
eat
some
innings
and
be
very
reliable
at
a
decent
price
tag
a
slight
bitter
coffee
taste
there
isnt
much
sweetness
to
cut
through
the
bitter
but
the
bitter
takes
place
deep
into
the
swallow
making
this
a
creamy
almost
lightbodied
beer
that
goes
down
easy
final
notes
a
decent
stout
though
nothing
really
special
would
probably
go
good
with
barbecue
or
nice
hearty
food
id
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
wont
go
looking
to
buy
this
beer
drinkability
a
decent
stout
its
nothing
particularly
memorable
but
pretty
solid
nonetheless
overall
not
what
i
expected
as
this
was
labeled
as
an
american
stout
here
on
ba
this
leans
toward
the
irish
dry
stout
category
although
the
abv
is
a
little
high
if
that
was
the
brewers
intent
decent
not
great
bought
this
as
a
part
of
a
mixed
sixpack
of
mendacino
beer
this
is
not
favorite
stout
but
it
was
enjoyable
very
dark
in
color
decent
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
a
litte
less
aggressive
than
id
like
at
the
low
abv
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
recommend
it
yikes
ive
had
a
number
of
beers
way
worse
but
this
is
just
one
of
those
that
does
not
suit
my
liking
you
really
should
love
an
ashy
oversmoky
stout
to
find
this
appealing
but
unfortunately
this
is
not
my
bag
hopefully
the
hawks
arent
this
dissappointing
tonight
i
had
this
with
some
thai
food
but
honestly
it
was
not
a
very
good
combination
im
thinking
this
would
go
better
with
desserts
such
as
chocolate
cake
or
cherry
pie
d
a
very
filling
beer
it
is
quite
heavy
but
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
pours
almost
black
with
an
airy
fluffy
tan
head
that
dwindles
down
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
modest
minerally
with
a
faint
malt
odor
taste
is
as
modest
as
the
smell
a
bit
of
fresh
dry
coffee
bean
with
a
tongue
load
of
bitter
flavor
at
the
end
a
decent
semisweetness
occurs
as
well
finish
is
actively
carbonated
and
the
hops
linger
around
a
while
balance
is
just
off
with
this
beer
big
stout
taste
is
lacking
imo
good
for
a
try
though
d
easy
drinking
abv
is
manageable
not
overwhelming
flavors
to
the
palette
not
filling
the
tartness
does
begin
to
wear
however
drinkability
this
is
a
unique
though
not
exactly
unconventional
stout
definitely
worth
it
d
not
really
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
not
a
fan
of
the
brewery
except
for
the
winter
seasonal
iipa
the
price
point
is
ok
at
6
99sixer
d
this
beer
is
average
in
every
way
except
the
mouthfeel
which
really
is
unpleasant
too
thin
to
be
imperial
but
too
smooth
and
oily
to
be
pleasant
this
is
just
stuck
in
an
unhappy
middle
i
wont
be
having
this
again
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
pours
a
dark
mahoganyalmost
black
color
with
1
finger
of
brownish
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
ring
smells
slightly
grainy
with
more
prominent
notes
of
roasted
malt
and
bitter
chocolate
tastes
is
initially
slightly
bitter
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
and
goes
out
with
a
lingering
astringent
slightly
harsh
bitter
finish
body
is
medium
with
nice
creaminess
and
drinkability
is
ok
hurt
mostly
by
the
finish
which
is
funny
because
the
bottle
claims
that
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
dry
yes
clean
not
so
much
d
due
to
the
overall
lightness
and
okay
flavor
this
stout
is
very
drinkable
good
for
an
evening
party
or
card
game
however
since
the
flavor
is
do
light
if
you
are
only
having
one
or
two
you
might
want
to
opt
for
something
else
drinkabilityoverall
sessionable
but
there
are
better
stouts
its
a
dark
beer
night
tonite
so
this
one
fits
the
bill
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
this
brew
yields
a
nice
black
licorice
and
chocolate
smell
it
pours
to
an
opaque
black
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
slowly
craters
taste
stays
in
tune
with
the
black
licorice
and
roasted
malts
there
is
hopping
but
it
barely
can
claw
through
the
maltiness
the
aftertaste
is
very
different
with
a
twang
that
hits
the
roof
of
the
mouth
then
fading
to
a
chaulky
bitterness
on
the
tongue
a
good
stout
but
a
little
too
funky
drinkability
this
is
a
low
alcohol
sessionable
stout
nothing
bad
here
but
nothing
too
good
either
really
goes
downhill
after
you
smell
it
pours
basically
pitch
black
with
a
short
mocha
colored
head
thin
brown
lace
smell
is
more
sharp
bitter
burnt
malt
than
malt
sweetness
some
coffee
apparant
in
the
smell
and
taste
more
charred
malt
in
the
taste
lots
of
roasted
and
burnt
flavors
not
really
ant
malt
sweetness
to
speak
of
finishes
slightly
bitter
almost
charcoallike
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
dry
but
not
really
a
smooth
finish
paired
well
with
a
sweet
dessert
that
helped
cut
the
slightly
sharp
acrid
finish
drinkability
this
beer
really
just
did
not
come
together
for
me
it
seems
as
though
the
flavors
were
too
separated
within
the
beer
the
smell
really
threw
me
off
and
while
the
taste
was
better
i
was
still
only
thinking
it
was
ok
at
best
i
will
be
passing
on
this
notes
this
would
be
a
good
mild
sessionable
stout
if
you
are
looking
for
something
big
and
bold
continue
to
look
elsewhere
but
it
is
enjoyable
drinkability
goes
down
well
typical
stout
aftertaste
but
not
overwhelming
and
somewhat
dry
id
drink
this
beer
again
although
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
stout
choice
d
wholly
unimpressive
but
decent
enough
the
flavors
are
very
basic
with
nothing
offputting
at
all
but
also
extremely
unremarkable
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
black
no
light
shines
through
but
was
surprised
by
the
small
head
that
disapatted
quickly
into
a
thin
film
not
your
traditional
stout
taste
a
little
coffee
bitterness
but
acts
more
like
a
crisp
bubbly
ale
despite
the
film
it
laces
nicely
hoppy
aftertaste
to
it
light
taste
considering
it
is
as
black
as
midnight
d
i
found
this
to
be
an
ok
but
not
great
stout
too
mild
for
my
tastes
actually
it
tastes
to
me
more
like
a
dark
mild
than
a
stout
the
low
abv
makes
for
easy
consumption
flavor
is
pretty
bland
a
little
watered
down
almost
like
basic
stouts
but
not
as
bitter
on
the
back
end
high
carbonation
at
very
cold
temps
but
eases
out
as
it
warms
decent
stout
nothing
special
pitch
black
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
cocoa
taste
is
chocolatesmoked
malts
and
cream
it
has
a
decent
taste
although
it
is
kind
of
watery
if
it
was
a
litle
heavier
it
probably
would
be
an
awesome
beer
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
all
told
the
taste
was
the
best
part
this
beer
had
a
really
solid
flavor
but
the
other
departments
were
lacking
a
little
still
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
overall
nice
light
to
medium
body
and
really
smooth
the
moderate
carbonation
seemed
to
fit
nicely
and
made
this
really
easy
to
drink
mostly
dry
finish
with
some
residual
bitterness
taste
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
roasted
taste
that
doesnt
taste
like
the
burnt
smell
the
sweetness
was
a
little
more
powerful
then
the
roasted
part
but
pretty
good
pours
deep
black
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
the
smell
is
pretty
weak
but
i
can
pick
out
some
black
malt
and
chocolate
aromas
taste
is
pretty
average
for
a
stout
good
roasted
characteristics
with
just
a
hint
of
floral
hoppiness
just
a
hint
mind
you
mouthfeel
is
good
if
slightly
watery
ends
dry
drinkability
okay
pretty
average
stout
on
all
points
d
simple
clean
beer
with
nothing
special
d
while
not
the
best
its
certainly
not
the
worst
i
would
probably
return
to
this
one
if
i
saw
it
in
the
fridge
but
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
memorable
stout
or
beverage
in
general
seems
a
little
simple
but
im
not
complaining
this
is
good
salud
drinkability
an
awesome
goto
stout
for
anybody
i
love
mendocinos
courage
to
let
the
hops
flourish
in
this
offering
as
it
really
sets
it
apart
from
other
stouts
on
the
shelf
low
abv
makes
this
overly
drinkable
without
throwing
in
a
boring
factor
as
this
actually
can
be
had
more
the
once
in
a
single
night
overall
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
that
will
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
for
a
long
time
t
mild
sourish
taste
very
vibrant
crisp
maltiness
to
it
with
limited
smokeyness
which
i
like
in
a
stout
kind
of
refreshing
actually
people
who
dont
like
deep
thick
stouts
may
find
this
beer
agreeable
those
looking
for
dark
thick
depth
will
be
left
wanting
more
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
this
stout
until
it
warmed
up
a
little
not
a
bad
stout
but
not
a
fantastic
stout
this
is
my
first
brew
from
mendocino
im
curious
overall
i
perfer
other
stouts
but
this
isnt
bad
its
just
not
exceptional
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
really
needs
better
carbonation
though
maybe
that
would
improve
the
head
d
not
a
bad
go
at
the
stout
category
but
not
something
id
want
much
of
if
more
than
one
its
a
mediocre
beer
that
has
no
real
standout
qualities
but
follows
american
stout
guidelines
fairly
well
it
may
lack
the
depth
of
the
big
guns
as
well
as
their
complexity
but
its
a
good
stout
and
worth
giving
a
try
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
expiration
date
or
lot
code
anywhere
to
be
seen
sampled
on
july
12
2009
as
it
pours
from
the
bottle
it
has
a
brown
color
but
once
it
fills
the
pint
glass
it
is
near
black
like
molasses
a
little
tan
head
tops
the
brew
and
dissoles
but
not
entirely
the
aroma
is
like
smoked
or
roasted
malts
coffee
grinds
and
a
dash
of
hops
on
the
tail
end
the
taste
gives
off
a
burnt
sensation
with
roasted
malts
and
a
subtle
dry
hop
finish
i
found
it
to
be
smooth
and
enjoyable
d
enjoyable
not
what
id
think
of
when
choosing
american
stout
but
certainly
has
its
place
terrific
price
to
boot
a
black
color
pour
with
a
thin
off
white
head
light
crbonation
little
to
no
lacing
aroma
of
roasty
grain
burn
toffee
and
coffee
flavor
is
rather
bland
roasted
grainsome
hoppiness
slightly
bitter
coffee
and
charcoal
thin
body
watey
mouthfeel
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
complex
quite
good
but
not
outstanding
mdnot
overly
heavybodied
poured
syrupy
but
not
as
bad
on
the
palate
distinct
hoppy
spice
and
bitterness
gives
this
nice
bite
and
a
drying
effect
well
balanced
because
of
this
i
can
and
will
enjoy
drinking
several
of
these
drinkability
a
good
stout
for
warm
weather
drinkability
not
the
thickest
of
stouts
that
i
have
had
very
smoothe
to
drink
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
two
of
these
but
it
was
very
good
d
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
pretty
big
beer
balance

a

pours
black

somewhat
roasty
with
lightly
nutty

notes
fairly
good
balance
between
roasty
notes
and
some
bitterness
in
the
taste
definite
notes
of
bitter
chocolate
which
is
pleasant
and
a
dusty
note
on
the
finish
which
is
a
little
distracting
pretty
smooth
with
som
light
sweetness
up

and
some
dry
bitterness
on

not

at

a
pretty

overall
smooth
and
uncompromisingly
clean
finish
with
black
malts
that
go
with
you
nothing
overly
outstanding
just
a
nice
dry
drinkable
stout
that
is
certainly
sessionable
at
5
2abv
medium
bodied
but
feels
like
youre
drinking
a
guinness
very
malty
in
body
the
typical
liquid
bread
type
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
fun
to
drink
drinkability
very
impressed
if
i
remember
correctly
i
was
sorely
disappointed
by
my
last
beer
from
mendocino
this
one
is
worlds
apart
from
that
one
drinkability
light
and
somewhat
smooth
hard
to
talk
up
drinkability
on
this
disappointing
stout
mendocino
has
better
brews
than
this
d
maybe
coming
off
a
pretty
good
beer
to
this
one
is
ruining
it
fo
me
but
this
isnt
a
big
winner
in
my
book
most
likely
will
not
buy
again
overall
this
was
certainly
a
solid
beer
but
just
a
little
on
the
weak
side
for
my
liking
it
is
worth
trying
and
i
recommend
it
for
anyone
who
likes
this
style
thin
mouthfeel
and
not
the
drinkability
of
many
other
quality
stouts
not
something
i
would
search
out
pours
a
deep
black
hue
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
smells
wonderfully
roasty
with
some
nice
hints
of
grassyenglish
hops
taste
is
very
good
sweet
malty
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
my
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
mouth
feel
its
thin
watery
just
doesnt
feel
right
for
a
stout
that
thin
body
does
however
make
it
quite
a
drinkable
brew
bottoms
up
i
would
buy
this
one
again
its
not
my
favorite
but
its
pretty
good
drinkability
very
high
overall
wouldnt
say
its
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
but
yet
a
good
solid
stout
d
this
is
a
fine
american
stout
better
than
many
although
not
fantastic
pretty
good
for
the
price
d
given
by
a
friend
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
this
beer
out
whilst
out
and
about
a
disappointment
to
say
the
least
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
threefinger
head
of
mochalike
foam
the
retention
of
the
resulting
cap
was
great
and
it
left
bands
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
my
glass
the
aroma
was
of
musty
malt
light
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavors
were
quite
dark
but
simple
for
the
style
lots
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
some
bittersweet
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
acidity
a
little
high
due
to
the
bitterness
the
carbonation
low
and
the
body
full
rather
onedimensional
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
bizarre
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
having
it
again
d
decent
stout
not
something
that
i
would
drink
again
though
seeing
as
there
are
much
better
options
beer
is
a
very
light
stout
somewhat
mediocre
lacks
character
very
drinkable
does
not
fill
me
up
at
all
just
wish
there
was
more
flavor
to
it
in
no
hurry
to
buy
again
dont
think
ill
have
another
one
of
these
ive
already
poured
too
many
beers
down
the
drain
d
overall
this
is
a
very
average
stout
good
for
the
price
but
id
spring
for
a
better
example
overall
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
stouts
and
im
not
even
a
fan
of
stouts
starts
with
a
nice
one
finger
light
brown
head
that
lasts
for
about
a
minute
before
the
first
sip
good
light
black
to
dark
brown
cola
with
dark
garnet
highlights
light
mocha
coffee
notes
some
coffee
flavored
cream
and
charcoal
roasted
malts
great
roasted
malt
and
soft
smoked
malt
flavors
in
this
beer
grainy
and
faintly
tinny
palate
but
still
prtty
drinkable
would
like
to
try
on
tap
pours
dark
brown
nearly
black
short
tan
head
licorice
chocolate
sweet
malt
and
some
roasted
coffee
in
the
aroma
very
loose
and
watery
mouthfeel
not
creamy
as
advertised
bakers
chocolate
roasted
barley
some
coffee
and
a
bitter
and
dry
hop
finish
decent
though
i
will
say
that
this
is
a
very
likable
brew
for
those
of
you
who
prefer
a
dark
beer
with
some
flavor
and
aroma
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
good
drinkability
that
wont
leave
you
with
hop
mouth
ie
that
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
one
reviewer
mentioned
overly
hopped
i
dont
get
that
at
all
overall
an
acceptable
stout
though
over
hopped
and
lacking
malt
balance
d
it
is
pleasing
but
i
will
never
buy
this
again
a
average
stout
with
a
overall
lightness
that
misses
the
mark
this
one
has
flavor
to
spare
and
is
a
drinkable
stout
but
needs
to
improve
the
backbone
a
little
to
be
one
to
reach
for
this
winter
d
while
i
didnt
love
this
beer
i
think
its
got
good
drinkability
nothing
too
disagreeable
about
it
unless
you
really
dislike
strong
black
coffee
notes
in
your
stout
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
ones
that
id
buy
before
trying
this
one
again
this
beer
really
came
through
this
is
certainly
a
breakfast
and
or
desert
beer
i
will
certainy
suggest
my
friends
try
this
beer
and
hope
to
one
day
sample
a
pour
straight
from
a
brewers
tap
not
the
worst
beer
that
ive
had
but
for
the
style
its
average
at
best
d
very
drinkable
with
a
definite
light
and
crisp
feel
to
it
especially
for
a
stout
lighter
and
a
bit
watery
for
my
tastes
and
i
doubt
id
drink
it
regularly
but
if
light
roasted
malt
without
a
ton
of
coffee
or
chocolate
is
your
thing
this
is
the
one
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
the
taste
is
a
strong
point
fairly
fullbodied
rich
and
complex
with
chocolatr
and
coffee
married
nicely
and
without
any
acrid
burnt
character
there
is
a
little
caramelly
licorice
quality
with
a
taste
element
and
feel
a
bit
like
root
beer
its
clean
and
easy
to
drink
however
the
palate
is
a
little
thin
lively
but
light
and
unusually
fizzy
for
a
stout
silky
creamy
and
rather
fullbodied
the
feel
of
black
hawk
stout
is
truly
succulent
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
d
i
guess
this
is
relatively
drinkable
since
there
isnt
any
disagreeable
flavors
there
just
isnt
a
lot
to
make
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
this
is
an
ok
stout
nothing
too
spectacular
a
good
looking
and
smelling
beer
but
falls
short
in
the
taste
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
i
would
drink
again
this
beer
poured
an
attractive
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
lasted
a
while
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
with
notes
of
coffee
the
flavor
was
also
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
bit
of
the
hops
coming
through
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
this
was
easy
drinking
and
an
enjoyable
beer
poured
a
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
muddy
brown
with
a
dark
tan
creamy
inch
of
head
had
a
sweet
chocolatey
malt
smell
tasted
like
sweet
chocolate
and
bitter
coffee
it
had
a
thin
consistency
not
very
stout
i
got
this
for
free
and
paid
just
the
right
amount
d
for
sure
a
very
drinkable
stout
while
it
is
not
my
favorite
mendocino
brew
nor
my
favorite
stout
its
still
a
fine
offering
black
thin
tan
head
some
chocolate
minimal
roastiness
not
much
else
going
on
here
nice
and
smooth
actually
too
smooth
somewhat
watery
nice
dry
finish
very
uncomplicated
and
very
drinkable
just
not
very
satisfying
you
better
plan
on
having
quite
a
few
d
quite
drinkable
this
is
the
first
beer
that
ive
had
from
mendocino
and
will
definitely
be
trying
some
more
of
their
brews
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
black
with
a
bit
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
licorice
and
bitter
chocolate
with
some
espresso
it
tasted
like
bitter
licorice
with
some
semisweet
mocha
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
tangy
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
fairly
unique
flavor
that
wasnt
bad
but
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
either
fairly
clean
and
drinkable
but
not
much
more
than
an
average
total
appeal
dont
expect
any
fireworks
from
this
stout
its
a
very
pleasant
little
number
slightly
sweet
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
but
nothing
to
phone
your
friends
about
carbonation
and
body
are
lacking
somewhat
which
leaves
the
discerning
drinker
a
little
disappointed
but
id
still
go
out
and
buy
another
sixpack
its
giving
me
exactly
the
kind
of
burnt
aftertaste
that
i
look
for
in
a
stout
or
a
porter
just
the
kind
that
i
dont
get
from
a
good
peaty
single
malt
scotch
like
laphraoig
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
nice
dark
red
color
but
a
thin
head
which
disappears
quickly
you
can
smell
light
hops
and
alcohol
a
little
alcohol
on
the
taste
as
well
as
burnt
malt
a
nice
smooth
finish
but
not
much
of
the
thicker
quality
that
is
associated
with
a
stout
extra
apperance
points
for
the
really
cool
bottle
more
like
a
dark
lager
then
a
true
stout
overall
pretty
disappointing
for
a
stout
the
taste
and
feel
are
just
off
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
and
provide
a
nice
lacing
quality
the
aroma
is
on
the
faint
side
for
a
stout
with
dark
malts
and
molasses
the
taste
like
the
aroma
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
with
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
moderate
bitterness
in
the
finish
from
the
hops
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
lacks
a
little
in
the
flavor
category
overall
black
hawk
stout
is
a
decent
stout
that
is
worth
a
shot
but
nothing
that
i
am
dying
to
purchase
again
i
found
this
to
be
a
below
average
stout
much
better
options
are
available
d
a
dark
roasted
treat
big
on
flavor
could
use
a
little
more
body
but
still
goes
down
nicely
hearty
pours
a
dark
black
which
is
nice
but
the
faint
head
dissipates
immediately
nose
is
malt
with
some
astringency
mouthfeel
is
light
and
its
a
bit
overcarbonated
theres
a
soapiness
that
is
a
little
unpleasant
could
have
been
a
bit
too
hot
during
the
hopping
process
i
think
its
the
hops
that
are
causing
this
soapiness
budget
priced
and
budget
taste
to
think
i
can
get
blackout
stout
from
glb
for
a
dollar
more
a
six
is
laughable
glad
i
only
bought
one
very
drinkable
you
could
pound
these
but
thats
not
what
im
looking
for
in
this
style
a
completely
average
stout
pours
black
but
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
burnt
grain
scent
but
nothing
else
and
weak
same
with
the
taste
although
there
is
a
little
bit
of
an
odd
bitter
aftertaste
not
really
hoppy
but
nothing
i
expect
from
a
stout
overall
i
felt
like
it
was
lacking
in
body
texture
and
taste
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
give
it
a
try
i
personally
prefer
guinness
or
murphys
irish
stout
im
not
a
big
fan
of
mendocino
after
trying
a
few
of
their
products
not
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
its
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
ive
had
many
beers
where
id
happily
drink
more
than
one
but
this
one
isnt
it
nice
to
sample
but
theres
much
better
stouts
out
there
dim
trying
not
to
be
biased
just
because
i
am
a
chicago
blackhawks
fanbut
i
love
the
name
and
the
stylethis
is
a
nice
redwhite
and
blue
stout
f
yeah
black
hawk
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
hints
of
chocolate
are
present
the
flavor
has
some
chocolate
or
perhaps
carob
and
kind
of
a
hoppy
finish
not
bad
but
there
are
so
many
better
examples
available
d
because
of
the
lightness
in
its
body
i
could
definitely
have
a
number
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
one
of
the
lighter
stouts
i
have
tried
this
has
a
very
pleasant
aroma
and
flavor
but
is
a
little
weak
overall
its
a
bit
too
sweet
and
lacking
in
hops
for
me
but
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
looks
like
fresh
motor
oil
on
the
pour
and
appears
almost
black
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
sticky
head
the
smell
is
malty
chocolate
and
roasted
notes
there
seems
to
be
some
metallic
offness
to
it
the
taste
has
the
same
metallic
characteristic
to
it
otherwise
very
malty
dark
chocolate
caramel
a
touch
of
burnt
coffee
and
has
a
warming
effect
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
minimal
carbonation
and
semidry
finish
drinkability
is
decent
i
wish
i
had
a
different
bottle
to
try
minus
the
metallic
smelltaste
d
while
this
beer
tastes
okay
i
think
i
wanted
a
stout
with
a
little
more
flavor
than
lightly
roasted
malts
t
it
was
very
carbonated
and
and
some
wold
say
too
much
i
am
ok
with
it
as
i
like
this
in
a
stout
anyway
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
and
was
quite
enjoyable
hopps
were
only
present
in
the
lingering
aftertaste
and
i
like
the
presence
of
them
at
this
time
pours
pretty
much
opaque
with
a
slight
dark
ruby
brown
highlight
and
about
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
head
that
soon
drowns
to
a
whisper
aromas
of
licorice
dark
roasty
malt
slight
chocolate
cocoa
powder
and
a
little
dark
fruit
no
hop
aroma
on
the
palate
it
opens
up
to
be
a
blend
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
dark
prune
and
raisin
it
finishes
dry
roasty
bitterness
and
very
clean
with
a
slight
wateriness
which
is
okay
for
5
abv
overall
a
clean
and
straight
forward
stout
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
at
least
it
was
cheap
wouldnt
buy
it
again
even
with
the
taste
smoothing
out
some
from
the
first
sip
i
would
refrain
from
calling
this
a
smooth
clean
taste
it
does
approach
refreshing
and
would
be
a
more
than
one
beer
event
as
it
is
5
2
alcohol
which
may
have
also
attributed
to
the
bitter
flavor
and
after
taste
o
this
seemed
to
be
a
really
quality
stout
though
it
was
a
little
less
weight
then
other
stouts
i
would
purchase
this
one
again
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
had
and
back
when
i
tried
it
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
most
bitter
beers
i
have
ever
had
for
a
while
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
now
a
few
years
later
i
realize
its
notsobitter
in
the
realm
of
stouts
but
its
still
a
great
beer
its
a
very
drinkable
stout
good
for
sessioning
and
hard
to
set
down
recommended
first
rating
for
a
brewery
ive
often
noted
on
display
at
every
venue
i
shop
this
one
is
the
first
from
a
sampler
jet
black
body
with
a
swift
diminishing
head
that
turns
to
basically
a
penicl
thin
moustache
sweet
caramel
notes
and
peata
bit
thin
to
probing
nostrils
thin
slightly
creamy
medium
bodied
and
pleasant
sweet
smooth
peaty
and
a
bit
malty
under
the
tonguesurprisingly
balanced
notmilky
and
smooth
not
hot
or
smoked
a
flexible
companionable
beer
especially
with
old
friends
like
greg
nikki
dave
and
jenn
on
a
snow
day
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
easy
to
drink
not
too
strong
to
drink
relatively
quick
unlike
most
stouts
not
too
much
alcohol
either
so
you
can
easily
have
3
or
4
this
is
daddys
mocha
d
very
drinkable
my
growler
was
empty
before
i
knew
it
i
will
definitely
be
in
the
tasting
room
soon
for
a
refill
highly
recommended
this
is
nice
very
clean
very
refreshing
for
a
stout
im
a
dry
bitter
stout
kind
of
guy
so
this
suits
me
fine
better
as
it
warms
up
to
room
temperature
would
go
well
with
an
assortment
of
sharp
cheddars
and
maybe
a
few
blue
cheeses
would
also
pair
well
with
a
rich
cheesecake
for
dessert
well
dont
know
if
id
get
this
again
in
a
sampler
makes
the
dark
beers
fans
like
me
happy
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
pours
opaque
but
with
little
tan
head
to
show
for
it
nose
is
very
muted
but
gives
just
the
slightest
hint
of
roasted
molasses
malts
flavor
is
heavily
roasted
and
very
very
smoked
calms
down
as
it
warms
and
gives
a
nice
robust
smoky
profile
feel
is
nice
well
bodied
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
on
a
good
level
too
smooth
overall
this
was
a
nice
surprise
much
more
developed
than
i
figured
it
would
be
and
very
much
worth
trying
mouthfeeldrinkability
it
leans
toward
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
good
all
in
all
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
its
a
straight
forward
american
stout
nothing
special
but
far
from
bad
poured
dark
brown
with
a
halfinch
of
tan
head
subdued
aroma
of
dark
toasted
grains
taste
is
rather
dull
onenote
finish
is
dry
and
somewhat
watery
this
might
be
a
good
introduction
stout
for
those
normally
put
off
by
this
style
but
for
stout
lovers
this
is
a
little
light
drinkability
not
a
bad
but
i
think
couple
of
these
are
all
i
would
want
in
a
sitting
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
almost
black
brown
that
was
almost
completely
opaque
had
a
1
finger
head
light
chocolaty
brown
head
that
left
lacings
and
a
ring
around
the
beer
i
smelled
wheat
bread
coffee
as
well
as
maple
sugar
in
the
aroma
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
i
occasionally
found
very
dark
chocolate
tastes
felt
tingly
in
the
mouth
was
slightly
bitter
except
for
the
bitter
tingling
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
found
myself
drinking
it
faster
than
i
remember
feels
watery
but
not
at
all
thin
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
its
really
nicely
balanced
more
darkly
sweet
than
bitter
just
ok
for
a
microdrinker
would
probably
be
an
ok
gateway
beer
for
a
person
who
likes
guiness
brewed
and
bottled
in
saratoga
springs
ny
being
local
i
had
to
try
it
and
i
am
glad
i
did
poured
from
12
ounce
bottle
to
1
pint
glass
very
little
to
no
head
but
the
lacing
was
very
good
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
the
flavor
mellowed
good
drinkability
i
just
wish
i
didnt
live
in
coors
light
country
sampled
at
the
odds
and
ends
tasting
ii
on
101907
this
brew
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
edges
medium
light
tan
head
that
burns
off
steadily
and
thin
rings
of
lacing
toasted
malt
aroma
with
nuts
and
vanilla
medium
smooth
body
with
roasted
malt
nut
and
mild
hops
flavors
the
finish
is
short
with
roasted
coffee
and
hops
slightly
above
average
overall
d
this
is
defiantly
a
session
stout
as
one
could
drink
a
number
of
these
at
one
sitting
but
would
soon
want
something
with
more
flavor
and
complexity
not
a
bad
stout
just
found
this
to
be
very
thin
and
a
bit
weak
in
the
flavor
profile
of
what
i
want
in
a
stout
notes
i
wanted
this
to
be
really
good
but
it
ended
up
being
an
extremely
average
stout
pass
on
this
one
okay
glad
i
tried
it
and
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
not
outstanding
d
this
beer
keeps
getting
better
as
it
warms
in
your
glass
and
with
another
fresh
cold
one
it
starts
all
over
again
yum
beer
poured
black
as
night
with
a
nice
well
sustained
tan
head
nose
is
a
slight
hint
of
malts
and
floral
hops
taste
is
classic
dry
irish
stout
chocolate
roasted
malts
dominate
up
front
the
finish
is
dry
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
a
bit
thinner
than
hoped
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
irish
stout
style
definitely
worth
a
try
d
not
bad
but
not
great
could
be
a
good
session
stout
due
to
the
fairly
low
abv
but
its
pretty
lacking
in
flavor
to
make
it
interesting
so
you
may
as
well
grab
one
of
the
super
low
abv
irish
dry
stouts
for
a
session
stout
still
a
drinkable
brew
can
you
say
imperial
stout
lite
if
there
is
such
a
thing
more
fruity
esters
than
i
was
expecting
mild
cocoa
flavor
but
little
roasted
character
to
it
it
has
a
rich
opaque
appearance
that
stares
at
you
in
the
face
its
pretty
dry
in
the
end
and
quite
drinkable
not
bad
by
any
means
i
just
was
expecting
a
much
bigger
roasted
character
d
overall
its
a
decent
enough
stout
but
a
bit
thin
for
my
expectations
the
roasted
grain
is
the
highlight
here
though
d
i
could
take
my
time
drinking
one
or
two
of
these
but
its
not
my
first
choice
if
i
was
going
to
drink
a
stout
medium
body
nice
sparkling
carbonation
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
the
head
fizzled
away
to
just
a
thin
little
layer
around
the
drink
the
color
is
a
dark
brownmolasses
the
aroma
had
a
plum
and
fruity
scent
to
it
the
taste
is
very
nice
just
a
little
bite
but
nothing
too
serious
i
would
order
this
stout
again
this
one
is
5
2
so
could
be
a
session
brew
for
some
enjoy
it
poured
a
very
dark
nearly
black
color
with
very
little
head
i
had
this
left
over
from
a
mixed
12
pack
so
it
was
a
few
months
old
which
could
account
for
the
lack
of
head
very
a
little
aroma
very
faint
roast
in
the
nose
however
it
was
very
flavorful
with
the
first
sip
a
little
chocolate
up
front
and
a
burnt
coffee
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
it
was
right
in
line
with
most
of
the
stouts
i
have
had
i
dont
normally
drink
stouts
but
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
different
and
this
hit
the
spot
i
found
very
drinkable
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
d
very

this
style

although
this
trend
more
toward
dry
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
info
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
solid
black
even
against
a

it
had
a
small
tan

that
faded
into
a
thin

heavy

no

followed
the
smell
with
roasted
malts
and
coffee
also
kinda
weak
the
mouthfeel
was
solid
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
if
you
can
easy
find
especially
if
in
someone
elses
fridge
but
there
are
better
amstouts
out
there
so
this
wont
be
a
player
in

rotation

t

this
poured
up
dark
black
and
opaque
with
a

roasted
malt
dominates
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
coffee
i
dont
know
it
seems
bland
roast
malts
come
through
first
on
tasting
with
a
hint
of
citusy
hops
in
the
background
and
the
finish
is
mild
a
bit
of
the
roasted
malt
lingers
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
beer
was
a
little
thin
its
a
good
stout
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
good
it
was
relatively
cheap
1
00
for
a
12oz
bottle
but
not
even
worth
the
buck
wont
ever
buy
this
again
much
better
stouts
in
the
same
price
range
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
up
front
that
starts
off
very
sweet
but
thats
offset
quickly
by
some
hop
bitterness
that
cuts
the
level
of
sweetness
pretty
well
i
also
get
some
good
chocolate
notes
along
with
some
roasted
malt
and
an
earthy
flavour
also
shows
up
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
but
at
the
very
end
it
comes
off
on
the
watery
side
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
to
it
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
fairly
brisk
pretty
good
stout
in
my
book
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
feel
i
can
do
much
better
in
the
price
range
drinkable
if
you
can
handle
the
burnt
flavor
theres
a
very
good
stout
in
here
somewhere
but
the
lasting
flavors
of
scorched
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
grounds
are
a
bit
over
the
top
drinkability
while
its
not
stoutstanding
it
is
pretty
decent
but
could
benefit
some
more
body
d
a
decent
introduction
to
darker
grains
i
bought
2
bottles
and
im
still
looking
forward
to
the
next
but
that
may
be
it
for
me
and
this
brew
smell
was
mild
coffee
beans
roasted
malt
and
damp
black
earth
nice
all
these
were
present
in
the
taste
too
as
well
as
a
fairly
easily
noticeable
smokiness
that
i
really
enjoied
this
is
good
a
good
dry
smokey
stout
as
i
said
before
the
thin
lackluster
mouthfeel
hurts
it
a
bit
but
everything
else
is
quite
nice
i
would
buy
this
again
not
a
bad
little
stout

the
mendocino
variety

it
looks
and
pours
the
way
a
stout
should
deep
opaque
brown
almost
black
with
a
rich
tan
head
aroma
is
stouty
and
smoky
with
hints
of
roasted
coffee
in
the
flavor
smokiness
predominates
there
are
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
hop
bitterness
is
strong
but
not
overwhelming
it
feels
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
it
is
smooth
and
satisfying
could
be
a
good
way
to
introduce
dark
beers
to
someone
accustomed
to
light
lagers
and
pale
ales
okay
not
a
bad
stout
by
any
means
but
there
is
much
better
out
there
a
bitter
toasted
dry
stout
for
sure
its
got
balls
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
would
gladly
drink
another
if
it
were
the
only
stout
around
too
thin
for
my
liking
d
this
is
a
good
stout
a
good
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
blend
of
flavors
a
deep
black
opaque
stout
with
a
solid
lighttan
head
aroma
is
surprisingly
light
and
spicy
for
a
stout
with
some
definite
smoke
almost
like
cigar
smoke
and
a
hint
of
dry
coffee
flavour
is
on
the
dryer
side
with
the
smokey
elements
sticking
around
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
molasses
again
the
dry
bitter
coffee
and

dark
chocolate

a

on

for
the

overall
i
really
like
this
its
like
a
bolder
version
of
guinness
d
ill
have
this
again
it
wasnt
bad
and
was
quite
different
with
its
touch
of
hops
drinkability
might
grab
a
6er
of
this
for
the
weekend
as
its
really
not
too
strong
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
them
d
not
a
bad
selection
id
like
to
give
it
another

bad
brew

you
can

the

poured
a

to

with

minor

aroma
consisted
of
a
mild
butterscotch
andor
caramel
aroma
but
not
much
else
i
couldnt
detect
any
hop
presence
to
speak
of
taste
was
both
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
slight
burnt
flavor
overall
this
is
a
smooth
stout
with
plenty
of
carbonation
despite
the
lackluster
head
this
beer
goes
down
easily
and
is
quite
enjoyable
although
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a

glass
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
forming
a
fluffy
1
inch
head
leaving
thick
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
weak
but
seems
to
consist
mostly
of
the
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
not
as
good
as
other
stouts
that
ive
tried
of
this
kind
it
tastes
mostly
of
roasted
malts
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
coffee
or
chocolate
not
bad
but
im
used
to
their
being
that
distinctive
coffee
flavor
with
a
stout
maybe
i
just
havent
tried
enough
american
stouts
to
get
the
full
range
of
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
seems
to
work
with
this
particular
stout
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
and
an
easy
enough
beer
to
have
a
few
of
during
a
session
a
roasted
taste
pervades
the
whole
drink
which
is
a
little
too
strong
as
a
personal
opinion
drinkability
the
crisp
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
did
not
cut
it
for
me
along
with
the
slighty
burnt
tones
not
one
i
would
recommend
drinkability
a
nice
buy
and
will
have
to
try
again
soon
d
a
pretty
well
crafted
stout
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
not
bad
black
opaque
in
the
body
but
a
dark
brown
tranluscence
at
the
edges
the
smell
is
mild
roasted
malts
nothing
bad
at
all
but
nothing
noticeably
special
either
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
it
does
have
a
pleasant
malt
character
that
tells
us
its
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
consistent
overall
a
pleasant
if
not
outstanding
beer
certainly
very
drinkable
d
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
depth
but
the
flavors
that
it
does
have
are
nice
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
finger
tan
head
that
disappates
to
just
a
coating
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
nice
roastedburnt
malts
coffee
and
some
dark
chocolate
taste
is
dominated
by
the
burnt
malts
also
present
are
notes
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
there
is
only
a
mere
hint
of
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
ok
the
beer
is
somewhat
creamy
thanks
to
the
caronation
but
is
a
bit
too
thin
in
body
good
drinkability
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
session
stout
and
a
well
crafted
brew
all
in
all
an
averageish
brew
not
bad
i
had
two
or
three
and
will
be
able
to
eventually
finish
the
rest
or
give
them
to
visitors
without
having
a
guilty
conscious
but
not
one
that
i
would
get
again
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
sample
i
found
myself
somewhat
unsure
of
my
thoughts
on
this
stout
ill
need
to
acquire
more
and
review
it
again
will
i
revisit
this
brew
yes
i
got
this
12
ounze
beer
from
a
mendocino
mix
case
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
there
was
a
bit
of
lace
not
a
lot
but
more
than
a
little
it
was
very
dark
and
thick
it
didnt
have
much
of
a
smell
the
taste
was
solid
very
malty
but
very
well
blended
the
thickness
provided
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
this
was
a
very
drinkable
stout
dont
drink
and
review
d
not
too
shabby
here
it
is
a
very
average
drinkable
stout
nothing
too
extreme
in
any
aspect
the
mouthfeel
is
bland
but
thats
about
it
i
am
not
impressed
by
this
but
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
handed
to
me
pours
pitch
black
but
with
a
thin
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
is
of
molasses
with
a
hint
of
caramel
i
find
it
a
little
overcarbonated
and
a
little
lacking
in
traditional
stout
flavors
there
isnt
enough
coffee
chocolate
taste
there
is
a
bit
of
liquorice
flavor
which
is
interesting
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
disappointing
for
a
stout
cheers2beers
dan
average
stout
but
not
sure
i
would
have
it
again
this
came
in
a
gift
pack
but
i
would
buy
it
more
likely
in
a
barrestaurant
than
to
buy
a
6pack
overall
a
decent
stout
with
enough
character
to
keep
things
interesting
flavor
becomes
more
complex
as
it
warms
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
dark
brown
with
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
reminiscent
of
chocolate
some
fruit
aromas
and
faint
alcohol
aroma
some
fruit
flavors
underneath
the
anticipated
roasted
malts
a
faint
tartness
in
the
background
no
significant
hop
presence
i
can
detect
nothing
special
but
this
isnt
bad
overall
a
lighter
stout
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
jen
this
brew
is
quite
perplexing
it
seems
like
a
stout
at
first
but
towards
the
end
i
just
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
dark
ale
the
taste
is
very
well
done
with
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
backed
with
smokey
malts
and
a
mild
caramel
sweetness
the
body
just
seems
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
i
like
this
but
i
am
disappointed
with
the
mouthfeel
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
thin
tan
head
with
no
real
retention
decent
lacing
smell
is
of
roasted
coffee
nut
and
hops
body
is
light
for
a
stout
with
very
little
carbonation
taste
is
of
roasted
coffee
with
a
bite
malty
finish
decent
good
session
beer
would
try
again
overall
a
nice
stout
with
a
manageable
abv
a
good
session
beer
really
a
very
nice
american
stout
loads
of
flavors
all
in
your
face
and
yet
extremely
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
fairly
good
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
makes
this
one
too
crisp
and
biting
on
the
tongue
for
me
overall
good
drinkability
though
simple
with
a
nice
toasted
flavor
just
not
much
in
it
to
continually
bring
me
back
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
as
it
is
really
drinkable
i
like
a
stout
or
porter
that
arent
over
the
top
in
the
roast
department
and
this
beer
satisfies
that
requirement
it
has
a
good
flavor
and
finishes
refreshing
it
is
not
an
imperial
stout
so
you
shouldnt
be
expecting
one
it
is
just
a
clean
and
wellbalanced
dry
stout
timing
and
mood
is
everything
i
know
but
i
enjoyed
this
dry
stout
i
had
just
finished
two
rather
sweet
malty
brews
and
this
stout
really
hit
the
spot
for
me
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
very
small
but
tenacious
tan
creamy
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
toffee
charcoal
dark
bread
molasses
and
plum
taste
follows
suit
very
bready
and
big
with
some
light
brothy
yeast
it
has
a
mediumfull
body
lightly
syrupy
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
hops
are
a
little
weak
on
the
finish
in
my
opinion
but
otherwise
this
is
quite
good
d
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
but
fans
of
dry
stouts
will
like
it
drinkability
a
good
easy
drinking
stout
at
least
worth
a
try
i
purchased
my
six
pack
on
sale
for
5
99
when
this
regularly
sell
for
8
99
in
nebraska
for
5
99
this
is
a
good
beer
at
8
99
this
is
overpriced
i
can
find
many
better
beers
for
less
pretty
good
stuff
it
just
gets
swallowed
up
by
the
bigger
bolder
and
richer
american
stouts
out
there
its
got
the
nearly
opaque
black
ruby
hue
with
a
dainty
silklike
head
and
lacing
a
solid
albeit
tame
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
supporting
but
not
overwhelming
sweetness
in
fact
the
malts
seem
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
that
is
supplied
by
the
burned
grains
and
the
american
hops
i
appreciate
it
that
the
hops
are
tightly
controlled
not
to
dominate
the
stout
the
body
is
where
the
beer
shinesgreat
creaminess
without
nitro
silky
texture
without
being
thick
or
chewy
thins
toward
the
finish
without
becomming
watery
finishes
quite
dry
and
with
a
pleasant
charcoallike
powderynessirish
dry
stout
alcohols
remain
consistant
and
muted
a
beautiful
beer
that
probably
gets
little
respect
to
clarify
the
taste
compared
to
guinness
this
beer
is
much
more
flavorful
sweeter
in
spite
of
the
hop
finish
and
generally
more
intense
an
aggressive
pour
lead
to
a
decent
one
inch
head
which
quickly
reduced
but
left
a
small
crown
the
body
was
totally
opaque
and
black
very
nice
to
look
at
my
first
whiff
was
a
strong
and
unbalanced
mix
of
alcohol
and
coffee
but
after
it
breathed
for
a
few
seconds
it
was
significantly
mellowed
and
some
floral
and
fruity
smells
came
through
strong
bitter
dark
and
burnt
malts
are
my
first
impression
followed
by
some
aggressive
hopping
sweetness
lingers
throughout
medium
bodied
with
a
bitter
and
slightly
boozy
finish
drinkable
nevertheless
and
quite
enjoyable
the
taste
is
a
little
better
but
somewhat
similar
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
but
its
definitely
lacking
in
complexity
for
a
stout
a
nice
offering
if
youre
stuck
in
a
state
with
an
abv
cap
notes
im
an
advocate
of
this
brewery
overall
and
this
is
no
exception
nicely
balanced
stout
price
per
quality
ratio
this
passes
with
flying
colors
musings
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
taste
character
is
great
but
is
not
matched
by
the
nose
or
the
body
feel
a
taste
this
full
should
be
backed
up
by
a
more
substantial
body
poured
out
opaque
coal
black
with
a
huge
milk
chocolate
head
that
petered
out
slowly
smells
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
with
a
slight
herbal
background
tastes
first
of
the
dark
malts
which
lead
into
a
fruitiness
alongside
a
bitter
roasted
finish
kind
of
weak
flavorwise
carbonation
levels
are
pretty
spoton
but
its
rather
watery
pretty
hohum
all
around
not
good
enough
for
me
to
buy
again
but
not
bad
enough
to
pour
down
the
drain
benjamin
franklin
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
filled
the
nose
but
nothing
over
outstanding
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
tart
and
a
touch
of
sourness
this
stout
got
a
little
better
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
little
not
impressed
with
this
stout
drinkability
certainly
the
best
mendocino
that
i
have
tasted
although
that
is
not
saying
much
this
is
a
respectable
effort
but
is
a
tad
too
disjointed
to
come
together
still
resonably
priced
and
a
solid
if
basic
stout
worth
a
try
brew
pours
to
a
deep
deep
brown
color
hedging
on
black
with
a
medium
tan
colored
head
that
has
some
retention
while
leaving
some
lacing
the
aromas
are
of
coffee
and
heavily
roasted
malts
a
somewhat
burnt
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
good
coffee
and
roasted
grains
that
go
right
along
with
what
was
in
the
nose
also
finished
with
a
hop
bitterness
that
seems
to
balance
it
out
nicely
very
dry
feel
to
it
overall
a
nice
offering
one
of
the
better
brew
offered
by
mendocino
imo
black
with
a
creamy
head
smells
of
highly
of
hops
and
some
dark
malts
the
taste
is
somewhat
hoppy
with
roastedburnt
malt
flavors
sweeter
caramel
flavors
but
of
the
little
chocolate
or
coffee
i
usualy
expect
mouthfeel
was
really
crisp
for
a
stout
overall
the
brew
was
enjoyable
but
not
exactly
what
i
expect
from
the
style
generally
this
was
a
refreshingly
drinkable
stout
poured
an
opaque
dark
brown
almost
black
with
loads
of
tan
colored
head
that
just
sat
still
for
minutes
and
left
behind
just
a
touch
of
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
malt
hard
candy
and
faint
dried
fruit
the
taste
was
as
might
be
expected
with
toastedsmoked
flavors
carrying
greater
intensity
than
the
sweetness
of
various
malts
somewhat
astringent
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
sour
flavor
that
didnt
go
away
this
was
my
2nd
beer
of
the
night
and
i
had
trouble
with
this
one
just
did
not
sit
well
with
me
and
adversely
affected
my
taste
buds
close
to
a
irish
dry
stout
especially
with
the
dry
gritty
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
but
still
processing
a
rich
overall
glow
it
may
be
just
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
but
the
relatively
low
abv
of
5
makes
this
a
good
session
candidate

especially
with
the
good
sixer
price
tag
ive
been
a
distant
fan
because
of
all
the
loyal
followers
of
this
brewery
and
their
red
tail
ale
would
always
stop
in
when
heading
up
to
reggae
on
the
river
and
they
are
truely
one
of
the
original
n
ca
hancrafted
brewers
so
i
was
excited
when
i
grabbed
a
sixer
of
the
stout
at
trader
joes
so
lets
start
with
what
matters
the
taste
disapointing
as
few
have
mentioned
already
this
falls
short
i
did
like
the
peety
smoke
taste
you
find
in
a
scotch
but
no
wow
factor
more
than
usual
carbination
for
a
stout
which
is
something
different
but
not
negative
if
its
on
sale
and
you
have
spent
your
beer
budget
maybe
damn
i
wanted
so
much
more
d
seems
that
this
beer
was
meant
to
be
very
middle
of
the
road
and
approachable
by
a
few
too
many
tastes
like
sacrifices
were
made
in
order
to
get
a
broader
appeal
that
being
said
i
know
i
dont
want
another
not
tonight
anyway
brewed
in
sartoga
springs
ny
wow
this
poured
a
black
as
fuck
black
virtually
no
ligh
gets
through
when
help
up
to
my
computer
monitor
decent
mocha
head
that
does
not
last
i
admit
i
did
a
bad
pour
here
not
a
enough
straight
on
head
creation
pouring
the
aroma
was
mild
but
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
smokey
with
a
hint
of
coffee
kinda
sweet
but
sharp
bitterly
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
kinda
watery
lite
but
smooth
thin
an
allright
stout
very
smooth
no
lingering
after
taste
yep
its
an
average
beer
the
picture
on
the
bottle
was
cool
and
that
was
about
it
for
this
one
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
malty
but
imo
it
was
stronger
in
the
hops
area
thats
just
what
my
buds
were
telling
me
the
head
was
pretty
nice
at
first
but
then
died
out
fairly
rapidly
leaving
nothing
behind
but
spottyat
best
laceing
the
taste
was
ok
just
nothing
too
special
not
something
ill
be
drinking
again
though
overall
a
decent
stout
not
amazing
but
a
mild
middle
of
the
road
stout
that
could
be
drank
a
novice
or
a
pro
dark
brown
color
with
reddish
hues
light
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
spots
of
oily
lacing
behind
aroma
is
faint
nuts
malted
barley
with
an
offmetallic
smell
thrown
in
there
as
well
a
little
weak
in
flavor
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
tastes
are
fairly
typical
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
metallicbitter
character
tagged
on
the
end
at
best
id
consider
it
an
average
stout
m
and
d
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
heavier
considering
its
jet
black
color
drinkability
is
ok
a
tasty
one
in
a
pinch
but
wouldnt
be
my
first
pick
i
would
have
this
again
however
if
the
opportunity
showed
itself
this
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
mostly
roasted
malt
with
a
little
coffee
the
taste
is
roasted
malt
and
not
much
else
the
mf
is
too
light
for
my
taste
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beerbut
not
a
good
stout
i
could
drink
this
all
nightbut
i
was
expecting
a
thicker
heavier
beer
than
this
drinkability
is
also
fine
i
could
drink
these
all
night
without
getting
too
bored
with
them
theres
a
real
good
chance
this
beer
will
find
its
way
into
my
rotation
again
someday
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
just
an
average
dry
stout
overall
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
but
it
is
deficient
of
something
more
what
more
i
dont
know
but
it
just
isnt
that
extraordinary
to
me
watch
out
that
first
sip
will
catch
out
off
guard
if
you
arent
ready
cheers
just
a
year
ago
i
would
not
have
liked
this
i
am
still
not
fond
of
it
but
have
a
fair
idea
of
what
bothers
me
about
it
flavors
suggest
poor
blending
and
possibly
low
quality
grains
little
amused
by
the
the
legend
grows
neck
ring
and
claims
that
mimic
budweisser
select
drinkable
but
marginal
and
it
turns
me
away
from
trying
other
brews
from
mendocino
black
with
a
brown
bubbly
head
that
becomes
a
thin
foam
on
top
week
at
the
nose
maybe
some
hops
maybe
the
taste
is
fine
just
fine
it
taste
like
they
missed
something
its
just
a
bit
off
but
i
dont
know
what
it
is
not
bad
its
just
that
something
is
missing
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
carbonated
for
a
stout
its
a
drinkable
beer
even
a
decent
beer
its
just
not
a
good
stout
all
in
all
black
hawk
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
particularly
inspiring
either
drink
if
you
cant
find
guinness
or
your
favorite
stout
this
is
a
good
solid
stout
everything
is
pretty
close
to
the
way
i
like
it
jet
black
with
coffee
chocolate
in
the
scent
taste
i
would
prefer
a
smoother
finish
this
tasted
a
little
too
carbonated
a
bit
too
piercing
i
would
say
a
bit
more
caramel
flavoring
would
be
nice
too
the
bitterness
in
this
stout
is
on
point
though
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
this
again
as
i
have
my
pick
of
so
many
different
stouts
in
this
area
but
this
is
a
good
effort
from
mendocino
a
little
bitter
for
me
poured
with
absolutely
no
head
a
very
dark
color
the
smell
is
nothing
to
brag
about
i
would
not
want
to
drink
these
much
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
there
are
simply
better
choices
of
this
style
i
like
for
a
stout
to
be
smooth
but
this
one
kinda
has
a
bite
to
it
smells
and
tastes
very
carmelly
hardly
bitter
at
all
mouthfeel
is
relatively
weak
damn
this
beer
is
a
complete
disappointment
after
the
appearance
this
seems
like
a
schwarzbier
not
a
stout
black
hawk
walks
the
walk
but
doesnt
talk
the
talk
the
taste
is
of
black
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
even
vanilla
bean
tastes
almost
like
a
black
lager
very
crisp
and
smooth
for
a
stout
as
is
printed
on
the
label
a
pleasant
chocolate
coffee
and
vanilla
taste
lingers
in
the
mouth
with
a
moderately
dry
finish
i
could
drink
the
shit
out
of
this
stout
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
im
sure
ive
had
this
before
it
was
much
better
but
memory
fails
me
now
poured
a
beautiful
deep
brown
color
with
nice
puffy
tannish
head
smell
is
very
light
and
not
overly
pleasant
very
disappointing
taste
is
nice
for
chocalate
caramel
roaasted
malt
but
the
hop
bitterness
is
too
overpowering
and
seems
to
become
stronger
with
each
sip
very
acid
and
astringent
mouth
feel
glad
i
only
bought
one
nice
looking
stout
very
symmetrical
looking
creamy
head
that
fades
to
a
solid
ring
around
the
outside
with
a
thinner
layer
in
the
middle
coffee
and
other
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
lightl
dark
chocolate
taste
is
good
although
not
great
nice
coffee
flavor
not
overpowering
hops
are
not
very
dominant
sweet
but
not
cloying
this
is
a
very
solid
and
drinkable
stout
pours
a
dark
coffee
brown
with
a
few
scattered
bubbles
but
no
actual
head
smells
burnt
and
roasty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
taste
is
quite
heavy
on
the
burnt
side
with
just
a
bit
of
coffee
and
unsweetened
chocolate
character
finish
is
dry
and
astringent
kind
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
but
drinkable
an
okay
stout
a
little
too
burnt
and
astringent
not
really
up
my
alley
despite
how
thick
it
poured
this
beer
is
only
mdthick
bodied
carbonation
is
mild
but
does
sting
the
tongue
a
bit
overall
no
flavor
dominated
to
an
unpleasant
extent
the
underlying
flavors
were
noticable
in
their
own
right
but
also
worked
to
keep
the
roast
flavor
from
isolation
easily
consumable
i
would
have
another
but
will
not
seek
it
out
good
looking
stout
almost
opaque
blackness
with
a
thick
beige
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
roasted
malts
coffee
and
dark
fruity
sweetness
taste
is
dominated
by
the
roasted
malts
with
a
bitter
coffeechocolate
finish
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
but
the
body
of
this
beer
is
too
thin
nothing
about
this
stout
really
wowed
me
but
it
was
a
cheap
single
and
i
could
certainly
stand
to
drink
more
overall
i
would
say
to
buy
if
it
you
have
the
chance
because
its
cheap
but
much
better
stouts
out
there
too
sweet
overall
a
solid
stout
pretty
inexpensive
goes
down
good
ill
get
it
again
to
keep
in
the
fridge
good
session
stout
and
also
a
good
one
for
people
who
might
not
like
some
of
the
stronger
examples
of
the
style
medium
to
full
bodied
crisp
and
dry
pours
a
near
pitch
black
with
a
thin
wispy
headdeeply
roasted
malt
and
bitter
chocolate
with
a
light
piney
note
there
is
a
real
hop
presence
to
this
stout
for
sure
when
drinking
at
room
tempbitter
unsweetened
chocolate
and
highly
roasted
malt
are
most
prevelant
but
a
drypiney
hoppiness
really
comes
trhu
as
it
warms
and
in
the
afterburps
an
above
average
stout
not
spectacular
but
i
would
drink
again
for
sure
overall
a
soso
stout
it
has
a
nice
crispnessdryness
from
the
hops
but
theres
really
no
malt
backbone
to
speak
of
drinkability
and
overall
your
average
stout
simple
as
that
nothing
too
special
but
nothing
too
horrible
this
may
be
a
good
beer
to
enlighten
fans
of
guinness
with
but
alas
its
nothing
special
this
one
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
roasted
malts
and
some
dark
fruits
interesting
the
flavor
has
a
good
malt
character
but
there
is
a
raisinlike
flavor
that
i
dont
prefer
in
a
stout
the
body
is
a
bit
light
as
well
could
use
some
thickness
drinkability
is
ok
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sharing
this
with
me
it
pours
a
slightly
browned
black
color
with
a
small
head
over
top
of
it
the
nose
is
slightly
roasted
but
mostly
raisiney
and
figgy
fruit
tones
the
flavor
is
a
little
weak
to
me
with
mostly
dark
fruit
tones
with
a
slight
roasted
hop
bitter
finish
the
feel
is
well
to
thin
almost
watery
overall
not
my
favorite
stout
the
flavors
are
not
necessarily
what
i
associate
with
a
stout
and
the
feel
is
just
to
thin
i
need
more
drinkability
its
a
bit
of
quandry
its
a
bit
too
heavy
to
session
but
its
not
really
unique
or
outstanding
enough
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
drink
still
i
cant
fault
it
for
being
a
good
basic
stout
i
dont
think
that
i
could
make
an
entire
session
out
of
this
stout
there
are
but
a
few
brews
that
are
in
that
class
but
its
a
good
choice
to
start
with
then
move
on
or
end
with
as
a
compliment
to
a
dessert
such
as
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
or
apple
pie
ala
mode
while
this
one
probably
wouldnt
make
a
good
warm
weather
choice
the
price
allows
you
to
have
this
brew
in
your
fridge
throughout
the
year
without
worrying
about
breaking
your
wallet
pretty
good
i
cant
believe
that
the
lowes
foods
by
me
sells
this
for
5
50
a
six
cant
beat
that
an
aggressive
pour
yields
a
thick
chunky
head
that
dissipates
into
a
nice
veil
medium
lacing
nose
is
all
roasted
malts
powdered
cocoa
coffe
and
bread
taste
is
same
but
buttery
smooth
and
has
a
nice
dry
hoppy
finish
light
carbonation
and
mediumlight
mouthfeel
make
this
a
good
session
beer
i
drank
one
with
a
bowl
of
hagen
daas
bailey
irich
cream
ice
cream
for
dessertwhat
a
perfect
match
a
great
deal
for
the
price
carbonation
is
indeed
rough
and
definitely
affects
negatively
the
drinkability
light
body
despite
apparent
viscosity
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
although
not
as
creamy
as
some
stouts
the
black
hawk
goes
down
nicely
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
the
blackhawk
poured
with
a
full
foamy
light
brown
head
and
left
a
coating
of
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
roasty
malt
came
through
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
spoke
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
notes
backed
with
a
mild
hoppy
bite
that
matched
the
complexity
of
the
malt
overall
quite
dry
and
an
admirable
example
of
its
style
i
have
had
better
but
this
one
was
quite
decent
a
solid
aboveaverage
stout
the
je
ne
sais
qua
of
the
beer
leaves
an
unsettling
vibe
i
will
not
seek
another
drinkability
tone
down
the
carbonation
but
otherwise
a
fine
stout
i
could
enjoy
more
of
these
drinkabilitynotes
a
pleasing
stout
surely
best
on
a
cool
dark
and
windy
autumn
day
and
not
during
an
extended
texas
summer
pours
pitch

a
touch

emerge
in
the
lingering
finish
not
bad
poured
a
pitch
black

creamy
with
a
thick

that
dissapated
quickly
leaving
only
a
thin
ring
and
slight
cloud
in
the
center
scents
of
toffee
coffee
dark
cherries
and
brandy
light
carbination
and
a
bit
of

burnt

in
the
sips
and
aftertaste
sherry
merlot

good
bitterness
good
mouthfeel
but
heavy
tasting
maybe
not
one
that
you
could
drink
a
ton
of
in
a
sitting
but
still
very
enjoyable
i
like
my
stouts
to
be
bigger
and
bolder
but
black
hawk
isnt
bad
its
a
reasonably
tasty
unchallenging
beer
that
would
be
perfect
for
those
newbies
who
express
an
interest
in
the
style
overall
impression
a
bit
disjointed
there
are
a
lot
of
nice
feathers
but
it
just
doesnt
gel
into
a
bird
nice
roasted
qualities
nice
sweet
note
but
the
bitter
is
a
bit
much
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
if
youre
a
stout
lover
worth
a
shot
the
taste
is
sweet
and
chocolate
like
in
the
begining
it
turns
harsh
and
burnt
like
with
some
coffee
notes
to
it
and
finishs
quite
dry
it
seemed
a
complex
flavor
very
enjoyable
the
beer
was
also
very
thick
and
chewy
so
good
malts
are
upfront
and
in
your
face
with
their
sweetness
followed
by
the
flavors
of
coffee
with
traces
of
chocolate
on
the
tongue
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
leaves
you
wanting
more
the
only
drawback
of
this
brew
is
that
the
carbonation
is
a
little
harsh
beer
is
good
happy
beering
one
weird
stout
cant
say
that
i
like
it
much
its
interesting
enough
but
something
just
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
on
this
stuff
drinkability
while
i
dont
think
that
1
59
for
this
bottle
was
out
of
line
it
will
be
awhile
before
i
pick
up
another
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
with
faint
reddish
highlights
and
a
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
into
a
sticky
lace
nose
is
roasted
malts
with
notes
of
sweet
dark
fruits
and
a
smoky
earthiness
body
is
decent
but
perhaps
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
taste
begins
with
sweet
black
malts
and
notes
of
caramel
followed
by
some
unsweetened
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
charcoal
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
not
a
bad
stout
but
nothing
special
notes
stout
light
come
to
mind
when
i
drink
this
it
has
the
makings
of
a
good
beer
but
falls
short
in
my
two
most
important
categories
which
is
taste
and
mouthfeel
too
thin
cheers
the
drinkability
is
fine
if
you
are
a
fan
of
stouts
this
could
be
used
as
the
perfect
decently
done
stout
great
for
giving
to
people
who
want
to
know
what
a
stout
will
generally
taste
like
if
done
right
its
not
earthshattering
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
simply
a
good
stout
drinkability
code
o
a
i
no
i
dont
remember
what
that
meant
but
i
wrote
3
5
and
remember
this
beer
when
im
buying
stouts
and
sometimes
nab
one
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
better
than
guinness
but
not
among
the
best
of
its
type
very
very
dark
chocolate
amber
with
a
nearly
browntan
head
that
settles
quickly
this
is
a
pretty
menacing
looking
stout
after
smelling
it
however
its
really
not
the
nose
is
sweeter
than
most
stouts
somewhat
fruity
in
nature
without
a
real
hop
presence
and
is
not
particularly
strong
surprising
to
say
the
least
the
charred
flavor
is
definitely
present
in
the
flavor
and
the
sweetness
unfortunately
takes
a
backseat
i
would
not
call
the
flavor
particularly
bold
it
has
all
the
signs
of
a
good
stout
but
the
volume
is
turned
down
almost
like
it
needs
to
warm
up
but
it
is
at
absolute
room
temperature
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
some
lace
aroma
of
rosted
grain
coffee
and
a
slight
touch
chickory
flavor
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
some
coffee
and
lactose
notes
not
very
much
in
terms
of
depth
but
solid
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
satisfying
if
unspectacular
stout
overall
a
decent
stout
very
drinkable
and
smooth
just
not
exceptional
bitter
espresso
followed
by
a
chalky
astringent
flavour
an
odd
hop
flavour
lingers
medium
bodied
somewhat
oily
w
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
has
a
smoky
component
that
reminds
me
of
hillshire
farms
summer
sausage
if
i
was
told
this
was
a
smoked
beer
i
would
have
believed
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
black
and
roasted
barley
a
real
dark
scent
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
caramel
taste
to
it
the
presence
of
black
barley
cannot
be
ignored
it
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
great
drinking
stout
a
real
pleasure
of
a
beer
dark
brown
almost
black
color
decent

light
brown
lasting
head
that

has

aromas
dark

and
dark
fruity
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
maybe
a
little
thin
finishes
with
a
nice
dry
bitterness
the
bottle
has
a
menacing

with

the
beer
is
extraordinarily
dark
brown
nearly
black
thin
tan
head
with
minimal

aroma
is
roasted

with
a
subtle
smokiness
the
beer
is
essentially
dry
with
considerable
hoppiness
its
medium
to
light
bodied
and
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
more
fullness
very
pleasant
bitter
coffee
taste
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
overall
its
a
somewhatbetterthanaverage
dry
stout
this
is
a
very
roasty
stout
but
the
flavor
is
not
as
big
as
it
should
be
coffee
is
dominant
and
there
are
touches
of
chocolate
this
beer
seemed
to
have
a
bit
of
a
smoky
flavor
to
it
which
was
nice
but
it
really
needed
more
of
a
base
to
it
the
body
was
thin
if
they
intensified
this
brew
a
bit
it
would
approach
the
upper
tier
of
stouts
but
it
falls
way
short
poured
a
deep
chocolate
brown
nearly
black
color
with
some
ruby
tints
shining
through
slight
phenolic
or
tannins
in
the
aroma
along
with

coffee
light
almost
watery

cordial
cherry
fruits
in
there
along
with
some
buttery
qualities
not
as
bad
as
i
make
it
out
to
be
easy
to
drink
but
middle
of

road
as
far
as
stouts
go
drinkability
if
you
can
drink
hoppy
beers
all
night
this
is
it
if
not
have
12
and
switch
to
something
else
if
i
designed
a
barleywinestoutporter
hybrid
this
would
be
it
this
is
a
good
beer
to
give
to
those
that
are
afraid
of
dark
beers
a
stepping
stone
on
the
way
to
drinking
a
true
stout
the
aroma
is
a
bit
light
and
really
has
no
predominant
characteristic
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
prominent
alcohol
sense
light
hops
and
some
coffee
notes
good
smooth
feel
and
very
good
drinkability
from
the
medium
body
if
you
are
in
a
mellow
mood
try
this
stout
out
it
is
a
pleasure
to
have
as
a
sleepy
time
stout
forget
about
sleepy
time
tea
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
the
best
color
and
head
were
nice
but
aroma
was
somewhat
lacking
faint
malts
taste
was
slightly
malty
but
lacked
character
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
not
great
no
discernibel
aftertatste
easy
enoogh
to
drink
but
needs
more
character
not
too
bad
nice
and
dry
but
lacks
a
bit
of
flavour
and
complexity
quite
roasty
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
slightly
fizzy
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
nothing
outstanding
dry
nroasty
uncomplicated
but
still
very
decent
in
the
end
anyways
kudos
that
dont
show
up
in
the
points
to
the
brewery
for
having
a
nice
theme
for
the
labels
i
hope
they
give
to
raptor
recovery
programs

from

milder

mouthfeel

is

surprisingly

an
average
or
less
than
average
dry
stout
across
the
board
for
what
its
worth
still
better
than
guiness
overall
this
beer
doesnt
have
that
smooth
creamy
quality
that
i
look
for
in
a
quality
dry
stout
would
not
buy
this
one
again
flavor
this
is
definitely
a
dry
stout
it
finishes
dry
but
the
flavor
has
complexities
of
both
hops
and
roasted
malts
if
there
were
such
a
thing
as
a
session
stout
this
is
it
a
beer
novice
should
make
this
one
of
hisher
first
stouts
drinkability
started
off
as
marginal
but
really
came
on
after
a
warming
period
a
little
more
bitter
than
id
prefer
but
i
dont
feel
full
and
ive
got
one
more
i
let
this
one
sit
a
bit
and
enjoyed
the
second
half
more
this
is
good
its
not
spectacular
but
its
full
of
good
taste
this
stout
had
no
head
and
left
zero
lacing
so
ambieance
was
not
good
faint
roasted
aroma
dryish
roasty
flavor
on
the
palate
fairly
smooth
but
had
a
rather
thin
body
not
that
this
is
bad
i
sometimes
dont
feel
like
drinking
something
akin
to
motor
oil
a
rather
disappointing
stout
from
a
brewery
that
i
wish
put
out
better
stuff
i
love
the
mendocino
coast
of
northern
california
i
wish
i
could
love
all
of
their
beers
not
just
red
tail
o
k
drinkability
i
guess
but
there
are
so
many
great
stouts
out
there
very
dry
coffeish
stout
roasty
like
guinness
but
with
more
roasty
and
coffee
overtones
the
beer
is
black
and
very
true
to
a
coffee
stout
with
a
dry
finish
malts
and
hops
are
nicely
balanced
as
the
ale
warms
up
and
the
blend
becomes
sweeter
a
nice
stout
to
seek
out
with
low
abv
drinkability
certainly
more
refreshing
than
other
stouts
nothing
too
heavy
on
the
palate
at
the
end
and
not
horribly
complex
perhaps
a
good
1st
stouttype
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
the
category
what
a
boring
boring
stout
even
though
i
tried
this
in
context
with
several
other
boring
boring
stouts
this
was
still
more
boring
the
flavor
is
thin
for
style
it
wasnt
too
burned
bitter
so
i
dont
think
the
problem
was
overreliance
on
black
pattent
im
not
really
sure
what
is
wrong
but
i
need
a
little
richness
in
my
stouts
and
this
doesnt
provide
a
bit
too
topheavy
this
one
too
much
bitter
and
sweet
but
not
enough
malt
to
give
body
and
balance
tasty
nonetheless
so
i
cant
fully
fault
this
very
very
incredibly
fruity
stout
this
stout
pours
black
with
a
barely
noticable
brown
head
there
isnt
much
of
an
aroma
but
what
is
there
is
mostly
a
sweet
chocolate
aroma
it
has
a
pretty
weak
flavor
that
keeps
you
longing
for
something
more
there
is
a
slight
roasted
chocolate
flavor
to
it
but
it
isnt
much
the
mediocrity
of
this
beer
in
a
way
helps
its
drinkability
but
youll
be
wishing
for
something
better
the
entire
time
well
the
war
in
iraq
is
a
week
old
and
i
sit
here
thankful
as
hell
that
while
iraqis
sit
with
black
hawks
overhead
i
sit
with
this
black
hawk
stout
in
hand
instead
black
hawk
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
not
quite
black
and
had
a
very
nice
light
brown
head
on
top
that
held
with
medium
retention
aroma
was
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
coffee
smell
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
silky
heavy
bodied
and
tasted
softly
of
cocoa
and
mocha
i
also
noticed
a
coppery
metallic
taste
but
it
was
really
really
tiny
maybe
just
my
imagination
the
aftertaste
was
balanced
out
with
a
crisp
hop
bitterness
not
too
much
however
the
drinkability
is
surpisingly
high
this
beer
just
seemed
to
meld
with
my
tastebuds
well
very
soft
and
balanced
from
top
to
bottom
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
stout
and
it
is
a
competitor
in
my
opinion
with
some
of
the
top
stouts
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
rich
tan
head
that
fades
down
slowly
that
leaves
a
thick
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
there
are
some
roasted
malt
aromas
that
are
very
apparent
with
slightly
sweet
undertones
the
taste
is
like
that
of
a
strong
coffee
mixed
with
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
comes
through
at
the
end
of
each
drink
the
body
is
medium
and
well
balanced
this
isnt
the
greatest
stout
that
ive
had
but
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
deep
black
color
with
a
tiny
beigebrown
hued
bubbly
head
that
carries
a
moderate
lace
flavor
is
heavy
in
notes
of
charcoal
and
burnt
tasting
coffee
fairly
bitter
and
acidic
tasting
as
noted
by
bros
body
is
full
but
not
overly
heavy
carbonation
is
fairly
light
to
some
this
may
be
a
drinkable
beer
but
for
me
i
couldnt
have
another
of
these
with
out
some
salted
peanuts
or
something
to
distract
from
the
charcoallike
flavor
this
stout
poured
black
with
light
brown
creamy
foam
that
left
a
good
coating
down
the
glass
the
initial
smell
was
rich
dark
roasted
malt
chicory
and
coffee
however
this
smell
dissipated
rapidly
and
by
the
last
sip
there
was
not
much
smell
left
the
taste
was
initially
somewhat
sweet
and
malty
followed
by
floral
hops
and
then
a
clean
bitter
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
drinkable
stout
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
100th
review
i
must
choose
a
stout
black
hawk
stout
randomly
makes
its
way
to
my
fridge
its
pitch
black
like
a
stout
should
be
but
hardly
any
head
formed
at
all
very
disappointing
i
poured
it
kind
of
roughly
too
but
then
the
aroma
kicked
in
and
made
up
for
it
in
a
way
its
a
wonderful
mix
of
dark
fruits
molasses
milky
sweetness
and
roastiness
just
as
the
label
says
this
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
stout
theres
not
much
of
a
coating
and
thick
type
of
feel
to
it
its
medium
bodied
and
crisp
the
flavors
dont
really
live
up
to
the
aroma
though
i
tasted
mostly
roastiness
and
hops
its
not
unpleasant
by
any
means
very
smooth
actually
i
was
yearning
for
something
more
to
come
out
of
the
flavor
though
i
enjoyed
the
hoppy
and
crisp
finish
and
the
hoppy
aftertaste
this
is
a
stout
worth
trying
its
not
gonna
knock
your
socks
off
but
itll
make
em
loose
i
feel
that
the
drinkability
and
aroma
are
the
best
qualities

if
you
like
sinebrychoff
porter
then
you
may
like
this
with
its
dry
woody
finish
and
lighter
body
i
really
like
this
beer
the
head
is
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
at
first
but
then
shrinks
down
to
a
light
foam
the
nose
is
metallic
which
is
kind
of
repulsive
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
quite
good
it
is
almost
black
in
color
but
a
little
bit
of
red
shines
through
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
hop
combination
is
quite
appealing
to
me
and
mixes
well
with
the
roasted
smoky
taste
as
i
moved
through
the
beer
i
picked
up
a
few
hints
of
coffee
and
toast
this
stout
has
a
chewy
characteristic
to
its
mouthfeel
which
i
find
to
be
quite
good
there
is
also
a
slight
sweetness
that
is
barely
detectable
all
things
considered
this
is
a
really
good
beer
aside
from
the
nose
the
taste
is
complex
the
hops
are
great
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
pretty
damn
near
black
with
a
persistant
dark
tan
head
aroma
is
pleasantly
roasty
but
lacking
much
complexity
the
flavor
too
is
dominated
by
a
roasty
maltiness
which
takes
on
the
character
of
bittersweet
chocolate
about
midpalate
and
finishes
with
a
significant
hop
presence
mediumfull
in
body
with
a
creamy
texture
and
a
dry
finish
nice
pours
out
to
be
quite
the
blackish
brew
with
a
bit
of
tan
head
tastes
of
burnt
chocolate
and
black
malt
this
is
a
good
stout
certainly
worth
drinking
but
there
are
many
better
stouts
on
the
market
a
dry
finish
keeps
you
sipping
this
beer
all
night
it
poured
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
healthy
dark
tan
head
the
head
receded
fairly
slow
leaving
only
a
slight
amount
of
lace
work
behind
the
smell
was
a
blend
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
grains
of
which
none
heavily
dominated
the
others
the
taste
was
initially
a
blend
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
then
nicely
moved
to
the
malts
a
slight
spicy
after
taste
was
present
that
finished
off
nice
and
dry
this
was
my
first
taste
of
this
brew
and
chances
are
i
will
try
it
again
if
other
selections
above
what
i
can
get
are
not
available
a
bit
too
dry
and
overly
oxidized
malt
i
guess
ill
put
the
rest
of
the
6er
to
task
for
black
and
tans
to
get
more
flavor
into
the
mix
not
bad
but
my
heart
lies
with
the
2
aforementioned
competitors
overall
a
good
stout
that
has
a
nice
complexity
of
flavors
and
a
unique
body
for
a
bottled
stout
this
is
the
only
bottled
stout
that
i
drink
at
room
temp
from
the
get
go
cooling
or
chilling
black
hawk
does
nothing
for
it
in
any
form
or
fashion
even
in
the
summer
i
dont
chill
this
one
i
do
live
in
maine
though
this
is
an
average
stout
it
tasts
good
but
only
because
i
love
the
style
i
would
drink
it
if
offered
it
again
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
unless
i
really
had
a
hankering
for
the
style
and
had
no
better
options
the
bottle
states
the
legend
grows
i
think
mendocino
should
pat
themselves
on
the
back
less
and
work
on
their
brews
more
they
may
have
been
one
of
the
pioneering
micros
waybackwhen
but
you
can
do
so
much
better
these
days

pick
up
again
though
the
quintessential
deep
brown
to
black
color
of
the
stout
style
with
a
head
that
is
monstrous
in
size
creamy
in
its
texture
light
chocolate
brown
in
its
color
lace
is
in
thick
sticky
sheets
that
cling
mightily
to
the
glass
sweet
chocolate
aroma
coffee
roasted
grains
also
make
the
nose
quite
aromatic
the
sweet
taste
of
chocolate
starts
it
off
with
the
malts
right
before
the
top
which
is
rich
and
thick
the
finish
sparingly
acidic
the
hops
stately
in
their
spicy
bite
and
the
semisweet
chocolate
dry
aftertaste
ends
a
quite
good
stout
the
head
is
a
beautiful
sight
rocky
brown
and
standing
proud
the
color
is
to
style
aroma
says
hops
in
10
foot
tall
letters
likeable
although
the
taste
settles
into
a
niceness
first
impression
is
a
sharp
almost
astringentdry
sensation
this
pushed
me
away
perhaps
i
served
it
too
cold
as
it
mellowed
as
the
glass
warmed
worth
a
try
but
im
not
likely
to
pay
the
price
when
there
is
so
much
competition
10
bucks
a
six
shame
really
if
mbc
dryhopped
this
i
think
it
would
be
marvellous
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
very
good
rocky

with
good
pockets
on

nose
the
aroma
was
of

some

all

it

dark

appearance
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
settles
slowly
toffeelike
character
in
the
nose
along
with
some
sweet
undertones
rich
creamy
coffeelike
flavor
with
underlying
caramel
sweetness
more
toffeelike
character
and
just
a
little
kick
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
body
is
closer
to
medium
than
full
creamy
sweetness
makes
for
a
great
mouthfeel
and
very
good
allaround
drinkability
i
like
a
more
fullbodied
stout
but
this
is
still
a
great
brew
and
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
a
decent
stout
nothing
special
just
a
well
rounded
stout
that
lacks
bit
of
character
ill
drink
it
again
and
recommend
it
as
well
while
it
is
not
slapyomomma
fantastic
it
is
a
really
really
good
stout
virtually
black

a

held
to
light

slowly

the
uniquely

aroma
is
combination
of
lightly
tart

roasted
barley
and
caramel
sweetness
w
subdued
notes
of
chocolate
malt
unfortunately
fruity
esters
carry
a
bit
too
strongly
into
the
flavor
profile
and
partially
mask
black
patent
and
chocolate
contributions
buttery
diacetyl
and
light
caramel
sweetness
dominate
once
the
fruitiness
fades
and
this
stout
is
left
a
tad
one
dimensional
lightly
bodied
finishes
dry
w
a
hint
of
black
malt
sharpness
and
fruity
tartness
fading
abruptly
black
hawk
is
an
interesting
stout
but
was
lacking
in
malt
character
its
fruitiness
makes
trying
it
worthwhile

and
very
good
the
hops
in
this
one
tended
to
dominate
this
stouts
finish
it
looks
great
albeit
thin
and
would
be
a
nice
stout
for
those
liking
more
a
hop
presence
in
their
stout
pours
jet
black
with
a
thick
creamy
brown
head
the
aroma
is
very
nutty
and
very
unique
there
is
a
very
unique
nutty
taste
in
this
stout
that
really
appeals
to
me
i
also
pick
up
some
toffee
on
the
tongue
pretty
bitter
a
unique
stout
worth
a
try
thinnish
and
on
the
dry
side
impressive
creamy
head
definitely
a
stout
with
bite
dark
burnt
malt
up
front
just
a
hint
of
caramel
midway
through
lovely
aromoa
just
a
bit
too
dry
on
the
finish
for
my
liking
a
very
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
nice
head
but
far
more
subtle
and
real
then
the
almost
burnt
taste
of
something
like
guinness
extra
hardly
needing
its
fortified
capacity
now
that
it
comes
from
canada
as
far
as
black
hawk
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
its
mouthfeel
could
have
been
creamier
but
the
aromas
and
head
were
great
great
american
rendition
of
a
stout
notes
black
hawk
stout
one
helluva
stout
and
another
topnotch
beer
from
mendocino
quite
complex
and
what
youd
also
expect
from
mendocino
most
definitely
give
it
a
try
i
didnt
findjust
a
plain
stout
catagory
it
is
not
really
sweet
nor
is
it
a
dry
stout
it
is
someplace
in
the
middle
it
is
just
a
good
solid
stout
o
a
pleasure
to
tip
back
to
celebrate
st
patricks
a
fine
irish
stout
with
full
flavor
and
feel
yep
this
is
a
fine
dry
stout
id
say
that
if
the
carbo
was
bumped
up
a
little
id
like
it
even
more
16
ounce
can
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
aroma
is
nice
but
very
light
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
the
brew
tastes
like
roasted
malt
coffee
burntcharred
malt
and
some
dark
chocolate
and
earthiness
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
has
mediumhigh
carbonation
i
thought
this
was
a
good
tasting
brew
although
the
weak
aroma
didnt
exactly
impress
me
its
worth
trying
3
99
for
a
single
can
o
disappointed
had
many
friends
tell
me
i
had
to
bring
this
back
from
my
trip
back
home
to
indy
not
commensurate
with
what
i
have
come
to
enjoy
about
sun
king
tasty
brew
to
some
but
for
me
this
ends
with
an
ehhhh
if
you
arent
going
to
drink
it
sort
of
feel
i
think
the
beer
is
missing
something
just
cannot
put
my
finger
on
it
i
think
whatever
this
recipe
is
should
be
experimented
with
some
interesting
ingredients
like
white
peppercorns
or
if
this
was
the
base
for
a
chili
pepper
beer
would
be
really
exciting
o
not
the
best
offering
from
sun
king
and
definitely
overpriced
but
its
worth
a
try
if
one
has
never
had
it
it
looks
amazing
and
tastes
very
smooth
but
its
far
from
rocking
my
world
onot
a
traditional
irish
dry
stout
had
a
brown
and
scotch
ale
twist
to
it
im
drinking
it
without
any
food
but
im
sure
it
would
hold
up
quite
well
with
any
kind
of
burger
most
sandwiches
and
probably
lots
of
other
munchies
on
tap
at
tomlinson
tap
room
actually
called
an
irish
brown
stout
this
was
a
great
beer
excellent
dark
brown
coloring
with
fantastic
head
and
very
nice
lacing
nice
deep
malty
scent
with
excellent
roasted
grains
but
not
an
overkill
of
coffee
or
chocolate
excellent
flavor
with
a
great
hit
of
dark
roasted
grains
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
nice
neutral
hop
finish
goes
down
very
very
smoothly
with
a
nice
dry
finish
excellent
brew
so
good
and
is
cold
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
however
i
prefer
a
thicker
stronger
more
robust
stout
i
was
introduced
to
guinness
a
long
time
ago
with
irish
car
bombs
but
now
i
ask
for
an
english
car
bomb
i
find
no
difference
between
draught
in
nitro
cans
or
bottles
great
classic
beer
i
wish
it
had
more
hoppy
flavor
although
its
pitch
black
and
high
in
calories
the
taste
is
light
almost
too
light
i
still
love
guinness
but
i
always
crave
more
the
mouthfeel
of
nitro
beers
is
always
great
but
in
my
opinion
guinness
is
a
little
watery
personally
i
still
think
its
better
than
murphys
the
feel
of
course
offers
lots
of
creaminess
on
the
tongue
and
it
flows
like
silk
it
does
have
that
thinness
as
well
though
again
style
is
in
mind
and
its
not
intended
to
be
any
kind
of
imperial
stout
there
is
a
slight
grainy
astringency
in
the
finish
must
try
and
must
mix
into
blacks
tans
pour
your
ipa
or
any
ale
and
then
top
coatt
with
guinness
the
beer
is
an
institution
they
actually
get
quite
a
bit
out
of
the
beer
for
the
low
alcohol
level
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
stout
the
body
is
a
bit
too
light
and
the
taste
a
bit
weaker
than
i
prefer
i
feel
like
a
warm
pint
on
tap
would
be
better
i
used
to
think
this
was
what
dark
beer
was
all
about
which
is
why
i
used
to
drink
miller
lite
ive
grown
up
since
then
and
moved
on
to
real
beer
if
youre
on
this
site
youre
probably
only
reading
this
bc
you
agree
with
me
guinness
is
just
bland
anymore
as
far
as
stoudts
go
o
this
is
the
guinness
that
everyone
associates
with
the
brand
and
much
better
without
the
nitro
that
said
its
a
classic
but
ultimately
a
little
too
bland
and
boring
for
my
personal
tastes
a
merely
decent
stout
guinness
is
my
macrobrew
beer
of
choice
its
not
great
but
its
not
at
all
bad
and
at
such
a
low
abv
you
can
enjoy
them
all
night
without
making
a
fool
of
yourself
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
the
creaminess
of
this
beer
is
matched
by
no
other
the
chocolate
coffe
flavors
come
straight
through
with
no
after
taste
not
to
heavy
not
to
light
simply
perfect
the
model
which
all
stouts
are
made
after
black
color
no
oxidation
flat
body
very
watery
and
tasteless
or
nearly
so
just
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
but
then
really
super
discreet
creamy
touch
unappetizing
finish
slightly
bitter
but
with
this
industrial
side
well
disgusting
really
not
good
at
all
it
seems
clear
that
a
cut
guinness
draught
classic
with
water
overall
its
impossible
not
to
drink
this
carbonation
is
offputting
from
a
canbottle
but
great
on
tap
i
average
that
as
above
average
head
is
well
lasting
laces
the
glass
nicely
the
taste
is
of
coffee
and
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
and
a
tangy
bite
of
bitterness
the
nitro
bottle
is
the
closest
thing
to
bringing
the
pub
home
o
guinness
has
always
come
off
as
adequate
and
this
time
is
no
different
you
can
defiantly
do
way
worse
and
vice
versa
i
would
recommend
buying
this
in
bulks
for
parties
beer
pong
and
etc
i
actually
seem
to
prefer
the
nitro
can
oppose
to
the
bottle
i
heard
its
really
good
on
tap
in
ireland
but
im
not
visiting
anytime
soon
d
good
for
that
stout
mood
you
might
get
in
when
the
craft
store
is
closed
the
nose
brings
some
very
light
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
its
hiding
in
the
background
some
light
toffee
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
bit
unappetizing
theres
too
much
toffee
and
not
enough
roast
the
creaminess
further
enhances
the
toffee
flavor
i
think
theres
probably
a
touch
of
diacetyl
in
there
but
not
too
much
mild
roast
that
really
doesnt
come
through
until
the
finish
which
is
too
dry
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
other
than
looking
at
it
note
i
dont
really
understand
this
extracold
stuff
i
assumed
i
was
drinking
a
guinness
draught
but
i
dont
really
know
now
im
not
a
big
fan
of
pasteurized
beer
generally
additionally
this
is
the
least
flavorful
iteration
of
guinness
ive
tried
so
far
poured
from
a
14
9
oz
nitro
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
and
slightly
sweet
taste
is
also
rather
mild
some
malts
much
less
flavor
than
some
other
guinness
stouts
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
lets
just
start
by
saying
that
i
wasnt
the
biggest
beer
drinker
until
i
started
drinking
this
i
really
do
enjoy
this
beer
and
its
got
a
great
flavor
and
full
body
and
the
color
is
something
to
be
liked
as
well
this
beer
kicks
ass
and
a
good
one
to
start
drinking
with
dr
sure
id
have
it
again
but
in
glasgows
real
alecask
ale
scene
why
bother
guinness
draught
is
better
outright
the
price
is
right
but
the
abv
is
low
the
aroma
is
darkly
toasted
malt
with
some
wisps
of
very
dark
fruit
not
much
cocoa
or
chocolate
though
those
notes
translate
to
the
flavor
as
well
but
with
muted
effectiveness
the
flavors
are
thwarted
by
a
creamy
flatness
i
dont
what
else
to
call
it
which
is
not
desirable
thanks
to
the
nitrobottle
this
beer
pour
beautifully
i
absolutely
love
the
way
guinness
looks
when
its
from
a
nitro
tap
and
this
looks
exactly
the
same
pours
with
a
thick
appearance
that
looks
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
it
turns
from
a
creamy
brown
color
to
a
very
transparent
black
when
held
up
to
light
you
can
see
through
this
and
it
is
a
dark
red
color
big
creamy
head
on
this
one
it
looks
like
what
a
cappuccino
would
look
like
now
i
had
to
write
a
lot
about
the
appearance
because
thats
the
best
part
of
this
beer
it
kinda
goes
downhill
from
here
scent
is
quite
pleasant
with
some
chocolate
and
malt
notes
also
has
a
kinda
skunky
scent
as
well
though
taste
is
way
too
watery
the
flavors
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
some
vanilla
are
there
but
just
way
too
watered
down
the
mouthfeel
is
just
like
i
said
way
too
watered
down
and
flat
i
know
this
is
because
of
the
nitro
but
ive
had
bears
that
werent
this
flat
from
nitro
taps
drinkability
is
somewhat
high
if
you
enjoy
drinking
chocolate
flavored
water
d
i
feel
like
this
may
be
a
bad
representation
of
guinness
and
i
will
definitely
try
different
variations
in
the
future
but
this
one
does
not
impress
at
all
on
tap
from
brewpubs
across
ireland
during
my
visit
in
2001
guinness
extra
cold
is
a
chilled
version
of
the
classic
irish
dry
stout
guinness
pours
the
same
appearance
as
a
draught
nice
head
and
laces
that
lingers
throughout
the
drinking
session
aroma
of
coffee
and
stout
chocolate
great
carbonation
and
medium
body
throughout
tastes
wonderful
being
extra
cold
really
liked
the
igloo
on
top
of
the
tab
handles
too
bad
theyre
not
served
in
the
states
the
beer
is
brewed
at
the
james
gate
brewery
in
dublin
ireland
and
would
be
a
great
pint
if
it
was
served
at
normal
ale
temperature
of
around
812
degrees
needless
to
say
even
if
the
beer
was
too
cold
it
was
still
quite
quaffable
low
carbonation
and
very
creamy
it
is
drinkable
but
does
not
invite
for
a
lot
probably
wont
buy
it
again
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
and
quite
sessionable
tis
a
pitty
the
beer
has
some
off
putting
scents
and
generally
is
quite
bland
and
watery
drinkability
this
beer
looks
wicked
cool
but
once
you
start
pouring
it
back
its
a
real
disappointment
if
you
want
something
light
that
boosts
your
ego
to
own
this
is
the
beer
but
for
the
price
youre
paying
the
overall
experience
is
woefully
unimpressive
thankfully
there
are
stronger
versions
of
this
iconic
brand
available
on
the
shelves
drinkability
ive
been
known
to
kill
a
6
pack
during
a
basketball
game
overall
a
good
standby
stout
without
getting
too
expensive
or
adventurous
d
drink
1
you
gotta
have
6
overall
still
not
impressed
my
first
guinness
and
i
was
so
excited
over
all
the
hype
but
i
was
not
impressed
i
expected
so
much
more
but
then
again
popular
beers
are
usually
the
worst
beers
because
they
are
made
to
please
the
mass
population
not
the
beer
advocates
d
good
for
a
session
i
like
drinking
this
out
at
the
bar
though
its
mild
by
good
beer
standards
you
sure
look
cooler
drinking
this
than
miller
lite
when
it
comes
to
smell
maybe
i
got
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
malt
but
its
mild
the
taste
is
sour
and
watery
not
much
depth
it
feels
surprisely
thin
in
the
mouth
lots
of
water
the
looks
sets
your
brain
for
something
better
thus
the
whole
experience
is
dissapointing
however
it
works
as
a
light
beer
if
i
may
say
a
really
crappy
stout
to
say
the
least
hugely
popular
in
the
uk
though
maybe
even
more
so
than
the
regular
guinness
draught
from
what
i
could
tell
all
marketing
and
nothing
else
avoid
i
would
pick
up
the
extra
stout
far
before
this
and
if
thats
not
available
there
are
other
dark
beers
out
there
notes
great
session
beer
good
when
you
want
something
nice
and
smooth
without
losing
all
of
its
flavor
nice
mild
beer
great
choice
at
a
bar
when
there
are
mostly
macros
almost
as
if
black
food
coloring
fell
into
some
flat
and
old
budweiser
but
this
has
even
less
alcohol
in
it
appearance
is
black
like
coffee
with
a
white
creamy
head
the
smell
is
is
on
the
mild
side
with
a
dash
of
a
typical
porter
if
i
dare
to
say
the
taste
is
smooth
creamy
and
light
its
like
the
bud
light
for
porters
stouts
in
a
good
way
though
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
carbonation
which
make
this
quite
a
unique
experience
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
is
oddly
addicting
it
finishes
smooth
and
mild
with
a
slight
malt
aftertaste
creeping
though
at
the
end
this
beer
is
truly
a
one
of
a
kind
in
fact
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
in
the
world
that
is
quite
like
this
but
if
someone
knows
of
one
let
me
know
d
overall
this
is
an
ubiquitous
beer
and
nothing
amazing
that
being
said
i
enjoy
it
and
will
often
choose
it
when
at
a
bar
and
must
choose
between
this
and
the
usual
macro
suspects
beer
is
thin
this
is
the
beer
that
people
say
its
bread
in
a
glass
its
about
as
light
as
beer
can
get
its
creamy
in
the
mouth
its
a
little
sweet
its
a
little
roasty
finishes
cleanly
i
pounded
it
in
a
few
minutes
without
realizing
it
i
could
drink
a
dozen
of
these
its
no
extra
stout
or
foreign
extra
stout
which
are
way
better
but
to
me
this
guinness
is
the
guinness
to
have
for
a
session
incredible
drinkability
silky
texture
and
satisfying
for
what
it
is
so
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
certainly
isnt
good
lacks
way
too
much
flavor
id
take
the
extra
stout
over
this
anyday
go
ireland
d
although
very
thick
delightful
to
drink
enjoy
this
beer
over
and
over
cheers
the
draught
is
drinkable
in
that
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
two
of
them
at
a
time
o
a
damn
good
beer
as
always
serving
type
nitrobottle
d
great
drinkability
due
to
the
low
abv
and
the
thin
mouthfeel
d
drinkable
but
it
just
doesnt
impress
me
as
a
beer
for
some
reason
simply
not
impressed
the
draught
is
good
but
its
no
extra
stout
d
4
2
abv
nuff
said
d
poundable
but
i
love
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
just
one
guinness
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
its
just
not
on
my
radar
these
days
drinkability
could
pound
these
all
night
and
at
the
moment
thats
exactly
what
im
doing
drinkability
im
not
irish
but
i
must
say
this
is
one
beer
i
can
knock
back
being
a
student
this
is
my
go
to
party
beer
served
from
bottle
into
euro
pint
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
red
hue
when
looking
down
onto
the
beer
has
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
stays
until
the
end
has
an
awesome
pouring
show
with
the
carbonation
slowly
making
its
way
to
the
top
the
aroma
has
slight
nutty
and
malty
hints
the
flavor
is
light
on
the
palate
with
little
to
no
carbonation
with
malty
notes
overall
this
is
not
horrible
but
it
is
definitely
not
a
beer
i
typically
buy
with
the
availability
it
will
probably
stay
that
way
however
instead
id
opt
up
to
the
fourpack
cans
of
guinness
you
can
pour
it
into
a
glass
savor
the
aroma
and
its
full
flavor
is
there
or
bestyet
find
it
served
properly
at
a
local
bar
this
twelvepack
bottled
variety
although
convenient
is
not
the
real
guinness
taste
that
makes
it
the
unofficial
beer
of
st
pattys
day
overall
i
can
understand
the
appeal
of
this
beer
but
dont
find
it
very
appealing
myself
i
think
it
is
thin
and
lacks
enough
complexity
to
make
it
a
decent
session
beer
i
actually
prefer
the
foreign
export
version
in
the
bottles
without
the
widget
and
think
that
they
have
more
flavor
and
better
body
ill
have
to
put
in
another
review
next
time
i
have
the
other
version
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
i
wanted
to
but
then
again
the
same
with
pabst
and
just
the
same
with
pabst
only
if
i
were
having
a
particularly
poor
and
alcoholic
week
overall
very
dissapointed
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
am
thinking
of
giving
the
rest
away
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
beer
i
had
this
years
ago
while
visiting
scottland
before
i
was
a
hard
core
beer
advocate
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
guinness
but
trying
this
in
scottland
was
amazing
i
guess
drinking
guinness
fresh
is
a
big
difference
it
actually
got
me
to
appreciate
regular
gunniess
in
the
states
and
was
one
of
my
transition
beers
into
the
wonderful
world
of
craft
beer
guinness
will
always
have
respect
from
me
as
getting
me
to
appreciate
better
beer
the
coolest
thing
while
i
was
thee
was
seeing
a
bartender
pour
a
beer
with
a
shamrock
on
the
top
notes
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
regular
guinness
draught
also
suffers
from
the
same
problems
too
light
and
watery
and
not
enough
flavor
not
bad
and
has
its
place
but
not
one
you
will
search
for
i
wasnt
around
for
the
good
old
days
of
guinness
thus
i
have
very
little
basis
for
comparison
but
i
think
its
safe
to
say
that
i
cant
quite
wrap
my
head
around
the
fact
that
people
rave
about
it
its
not
really
all
that
bad
but
its
not
all
that
good
especially
for
the
price
with
options
like
carlow
paper
city
or
murphys
dry
stout
are
readily
available
i
have
little
desire
to
drink
this
sadly
beamish
is
gone
appearance
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
the
nitro
made
off
white
creamy
head
leaving
almost
a
curtain
of
lace
smell
has
light
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
faint
dark
fruit
note
taste
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
light
chocolate
with
light
hop
mouthfeel
has
a
creamy
smoothness
that
goes
down
slick
with
little
carbonation
a
little
watered
down
from
other
stouts
but
one
id
love
to
try
on
tap
buy
again
on
tap
in
a
bar
yes
otherwise
id
have
to
see
what
is
available
hmmm
this
one
present
and
interesting
conundrum
on
the
one
hand
you
want
to
slam
it
hard
i
mean
who
ever
heard
of
a
guinness
brewed
for
cold
they
do
not
belong
in
the
same
sentence
however
when
you
try
to
get
inside
the
brewers
head
you
cant
help
but
come
up
with
love
as
a
beer
this
is
pretty
unimpresssive
the
label
states
that
this
is
to
be
consumed
from
the
bottle
not
much
to
look
at
or
smell
you
can
sniff
out
some
roasted
malt
and
earthy
hops
if
you
try
but
the
flavor
is
a
notch
above
bmc
as
there
is
a
roasted
grain
presence
a
bit
of
real
hops
as
well
the
upshot
is
this
is
a
beer
brewed
for
those
times
when
a
real
beer
lover
is
trapped
you
know
what
im
talkin
about
the
bars
that
only
have
iced
bottles
no
taps
viewed
in
that
light
this
beer
is
a
life
line
for
those
of
us
who
are
looking
at
a
night
of
ice
cold
piss
or
something
closer
to
beer
the
thin
feel
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
but
it
does
enhance
drinkability
enabling
you
to
quaff
at
a
dangerous
clip
so
remember
this
is
a
beer
for
club
night
and
it
aint
so
bad
just
order
one
and
slam
it
down
with
your
buddies
and
before
you
know
it
youre
one
of
the
guys
not
a
beer
snob
suck
em
down
in
a
hurry
and
then
move
on
to
a
better
beer
a
nice
stout
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
overall
i
really
do
still
like
this
beer
i
still
have
never
had
it
on
tap
or
out
of
a
nitro
can
which
is
supposed
to
be
better
and
now
that
i
have
had
the
oppurtunity
to
try
extra
stout
i
am
still
kind
of
jaded
by
that
but
that
isnt
fair
because
that
is
like
comparing
an
xbox
to
and
xbox
360
both
beers
are
winners
but
i
just
prefer
the
extra
stout
dont
get
me
wrong
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
stuff
because
it
is
a
very
good
session
beer
update
2011
not
bad
it
grew
on
me
a
bit
over
the
years
but
still
sometimes
can
be
undesirable
to
me
d
very
rich
easy
to
drink
and
low
abv
makes
this
beer
exceptional
to
drink
in
excess
its
a
bitter
boggy
taste
that
doesnt
give
a
sharp
carbonated
bite
its
smooth
and
very
flavorful
but
its
again
not
for
everyone
drinkability
i
guess
you
have
to
be
european
to
enjoy
this
i
will
never
buy
this
again
taste
is
a
bit
disappointing
quite
watery
and
tame
a
bit
roasty
but
not
too
much
here
id
say
the
nitro
can
or
draft
is
the
way
to
go
for
this
beer
skip
the
bottle
while
i
like
the
beer
from
a
tap
more
it
isnt
bad
in
bottle
form
except
that
you
are
supposed
to
drink
it
from
the
bottle
a
little
weird
but
whatever
looked
pretty
good
tasted
decent
smelled
like
guinness
had
a
wonderfully
thick
mouthfeel
overall
drinkability
was
great
easy
to
take
the
bottle
with
you
places
rather
than
having
to
utilize
a
tap
system
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
feels
like
it
lacks
in
everything
the
guinness
extra
stout
is
a
far
superior
beer
to
this
in
my
humble
opinion
this
simply
tastes
weak
and
watereddown
in
comparison
frankly
im
disappointed
that
i
bought
a
whole
24
pack
of
this
and
im
going
to
have
to
either
pass
it
on
to
someone
who
doesnt
realize
or
care
how
much
better
the
extra
stout
is
or
ill
have
to
get
rid
of
it
some
other
way
the
prospect
of
drinking
this
over
the
next
couple
weeks
does
not
appeal
to
me
in
the
slightest
t
roasted
malts
and
a
coffeelike
taste
swims
inside
my
mouth
silky
to
the
touch
as
to
the
pour
its
a
mild
bodied
beer
and
although
the
palate
is
not
too
stimulated
this
noncarbonated
drink
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
good
lacing
very
high
drinkablility
a
definite
pleasure
d
great
i
can
have
alot
of
these
not
problem
cheers
i
think
the
thing
i
like
most
about
guinness
draught
is
pouring
it
from
a
nitrocan
to
obtain
that
perfect
guinness
pour
it
really
is
a
beautiful
thing
when
it
settles
appearance
gets
a
high
score
here
but
everything
else
falls
short
i
used
to
think
it
was
pitch
black
but
now
that
i
am
reviewing
it
i
can
see
that
it
really
is
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
the
smell
is
of
toasty
malts
and
barley
no
hop
presence
smells
sweet
of
oak
and
vanilla
as
well
taste
is
dry
and
dull
with
some
chocolate
and
oaky
notes
a
dry
stout
is
a
dry
stout
what
can
i
say
i
also
used
to
think
that
drinking
these
was
like
drinking
a
milkshake
but
now
it
is
rather
thin
on
my
palate
it
certainly
is
creamy
with
the
help
of
the
nitro
induced
head
very
drinkable
beer
low
abv
so
a
few
wont
put
you
back
too
much
a
solid
irish
dry
and
i
will
never
hesitate
to
order
a
nice
and
cold
one
at
local
bars
everything
about
the
same
as
the
bottle
or
the
can
but
it
seems
to
bee
alot
more
drinkable
i
mean
alot
more
drinkable
like
as
wheare
i
can
lose
count
of
how
many
i
drank
and
then
try
to
walk
striaght
but
it
is
still
missing
something
when
it
comes
to
mouthfeel
like
something
thats
in
every
other
beer
i
have
tried
i
do
not
know
its
just
seems
flat
brilliant
while
i
really
enjoy
their
extra
stout
and
anniversary
beer
i
personally
think
this
is
my
favorite
d
i
could
and
have
had
these
all
night
fantastic
all
around
and
not
so
rich
actually
not
very
rich
at
all
that
they
cant
be
pounded
something
ive
also
done
the
last
sip
of
all
the
foam
is
something
to
look
forward
to
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
with
good
flavor
and
nice
simple
complexity
without
trying
to
do
too
much
this
is
not
an
afternoon
bbq
beer
but
a
nice
steak
dinner
brew
for
those
looking
for
a
change
well
its
not
cool
but
its
still
better
than
the
extrametal
extrawatery
light
beers
still
its
extremely
weak
for
a
stout
it
makes
me
wonder
if
the
tap
version
is
better
at
the
pubs
the
only
exciting
thing
about
it
is
breaking
it
once
empty
yep
put
it
in
a
bag
smash
it
against
the
wall
and
take
a
look
at
that
widget
as
such
not
bad
nothing
outstanding
a
sturdy
drinker
in
either
the
summer
heat
or
winter
cold
a
very
sessionable
brew
guinness
on
tap
is
just
about
my
favorite
beer
but
the
nitrobottle
version
is
no
where
close
its
a
good
choice
when
youre
out
of
options
but
i
wont
be
getting
it
as
a
first
pick
any
more
pretty
weak
on
the
nose
and
pretty
watery
body
the
widget
banging
around
inside
got
kind
of
annoying
after
a
while
too
still
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
though
this
version
doesnt
do
the
beer
any
justice
what
a
disappointment
compared
to
real
draft
guinness
or
even
the
extra
stout
this
watery
tasting
beverage
seems
devoid
of
real
stout
characteristics
where
are
the
roasted
coffeelike
flavors
where
is
the
dry
bitter
finish
no
this
is
no
guinness
this
is
a
cheap
imitation
being
put
forth
by
walstreet
robots
trying
to
earn
a
cheap
dollar
one
more
reason
i
hate
the
robot
takeover
of
humanity
robots
have
no
tastebuds
d
this
is
not
my
goto
stout
i
expected
more
from
the
heavily
advertised
company
and
i
just
cannot
see
why
people
enjoy
this
there
are
plenty
of
other
better
stouts
out
there
md
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
has
a
very
morning
like
coffee
feel
that
being
said
it
is
smooth
like
a
wake
up
beer
as
coffee
is
to
wakeing
up
in
the
morning
milky
feel
rolls
over
the
tongue
very
easy
as
drinkable
as
a
dry
stout
gets
highly
recommended
for
massive
drinking
from
pub
pints
add
strongbow
for
extra
flavor
guinness
is
a
great
beer
i
like
this
version
but
i
really
prefer
it
on
tap
my
problem
is
that
it
gets
warm
pretty
easily
and
when
its
warm
its
kind
of
hard
to
drink
it
goes
down
smooth
and
it
great
on
its
own
sometimes
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
guinness
i
love
it
even
more
on
tap
i
am
not
a
fan
when
its
in
a
can
nitro
bottle
and
tap
are
the
way
to
go
pours
a
nice
dark
opaque
pour
with
medium
carbonation
one
finger
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
has
an
immediate
malty
and
mild
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
upon
tasting
you
can
definitely
taste
the
malts
and
there
is
a
nice
subtle
chocolate
flavor
towards
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
drinks
like
a
chocolate
milk
very
little
carbonation
at
all
coats
the
mouth
very
well
and
is
very
drinkable
easily
a
session
beer
if
you
have
limited
options
what
happened
to
the
taste
it
would
seem
that
the
boys
at
st
jamess
gate
have
spent
more
time
trying
to
figure
out
this
widget
thing
than
making
a
good
beer
it
is
smooth
as
it
should
be
but
at
a
great
sacrifice
to
flavour
final
thoughts
my
favorite
beer
of
all
could
drink
this
delightful
beer
all
day
granted
i
could
pay
for
it
cost
isnt
an
option
though
for
what
i
enjoy
try
it
if
your
a
stought
fan
the
can
made
it
nice
cuz
it
was
on
sale
one
of
my
everyday
beers
but
not
one
of
my
favs
i
guess
that
is
what
makes
guinness
so
popular
jeje
d
most
def
i
could
drink
a
pitcher
of
this
tastses
great
in
an
irish
car
bomb
notes
i
have
a
very
fond
memory
from
my
childhood
of
going
out
to
eat
with
my
grandfather
when
i
was
around
fourteen
i
had
heard
of
guinness
so
i
jumped
at
the
opportunity
to
taste
his
i
remember
it
tasting
very
heavy
very
rich
and
very
very
bitter
drinking
this
beer
now
i
find
none
of
those
qualities
this
could
be
that
i
was
so
young
and
i
had
never
really
had
beer
before
or
it
could
be
that
guinness
has
decided
to
dumb
down
their
product
judging
by
some
of
the
other
reviews
on
this
site
its
the
latter
and
this
is
such
a
shame
regardless
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
avoid
unless
youre
a
fan
of
watery
tasteless
light
stouts
that
bring
shame
upon
the
name
of
beer
too
bad
theres
not
as
much
flavor
as
id
remembered
this
was
one
of
my
first
stouts
and
was
pretty
impressed
with
it
for
a
while
before
i
really
began
to
learn
what
was
out
there
overall
its
a
great
stout
that
can
be
drank
at
anytime
not
expensive
and
a
good
beer
to
chill
with
this
brew
left
me
hanging
after
the
big
build
up
from
the
pour
d
very
drinkable
and
light
the
nitro
makes
this
go
down
smoothly
with
little
gas
filling
you
up
after
a
summer
in
ireland
guinness
is
easily
my
favorite
beer
unfortunately
the
only
proper
way
to
have
one
is
from
a
tap
in
ireland
and
poured
by
someone
who
knows
the
right
way
to
do
it
of
all
of
the
guinness
products
available
in
the
usa
this
comes
closest
it
is
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
in
ireland
but
smooth
and
with
the
right
feel
excellent
particularly
with
dinner
goes
down
as
smooth
as
water
very
drinkeable
enough
character
and
body
to
keep
things
interesting
but
not
so
much
as
to
make
you
say
enough
its
drinkable
but
its
a
bit
of
a
chore
i
still
have
one
left
in
my
fridge
and
its
getting
neglected
due
to
a
recent
purchase
of
irish
red
overall
im
just
wondering
what
to
do
with
the
other
one
in
my
fridge
kidding
this
serving
does
not
live
up
to
the
guinness
stout
name
that
i
know
and
love
and
own
a
tshirt
even
note
it
did
say
drink
directly
from
the
bottle
so
i
tried
it
that
way
too
it
made
no
difference
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
last
night
a
friend
brought
over
a
bunch
of
these
for
my
dad
color
was
nearly
black
big
1
12
inch
tan
head
that
was
pretty
soapy
with
a
pillowy
backdrop
leaves
some
lace
at
first
decent
retention
smell
is
quite
weak
with
roasted
barley
burned
malts
and
some
light
bready
scents
taste
is
rather
dry
leaves
a
bit
of
a
coating
in
the
finish
roasted
malts
and
barley
is
pretty
much
all
i
pick
up
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
and
roasty
medium
to
full
bodied
too
much
carbonation
could
drink
two
of
these
and
that
would
probably
be
about
it
a
little
lighter
than
the
standard
guinness
i
am
used
to
having
would
probably
go
for
that
over
this
if
i
had
the
choice
do
not
see
myself
having
more
of
this
any
time
soon
might
be
worth
trying
great
start
for
someone
looking
to
get
into
more
advanced
beers
and
with
its
wide
availability
a
good
choice
gotta
love
guinness
overall
this
is
still
a
standby
as
it
is
a
quality
beer
and
highly
available
but
i
have
had
better
stouts
i
do
think
the
nitro
bottle
has
a
positive
effect
on
the
head
and
the
general
appearance
overall
a
fine
version
of
a
classic
stout
very
easy
to
drink
and
at
only
4
2abv
certainly
session
worthy
enjoy
most
folks
not
up
on
there
beer
assume
this
is
a
thick
heavy
high
alcohol
beer
nothing
is
farther
from
the
truth
the
only
thing
strong
is
the
taste
overall
i
wish
guinness
were
a
bit
thicker
and
had
more
flavor
because
what
faint
flavor
it
has
is
wonderful
but
just
not
quite
bold
enough
this
is
very
drinkable
though
especially
for
a
stout
one
of
my
favorites
to
have
a
few
of
d
i
actually
enjoy
guinness
extra
cold
a
great
deal
its
a
great
session
brew
not
too
stout
where
its
hard
to
drink
too
many
low
abv
lends
to
its
drinkability
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
served
at
lambeau
field
when
i
watched
the
packers
make
the
lions
the
first
016
team
in
the
nfl
this
weekend
it
was
a
great
game
to
watch
with
a
cold
guinness
in
hand
while
the
nitrogen
is
supposed
to
add
a
nice
creamy
texture
i
have
never
actually
been
a
big
fan
i
think
it
masks
the
flavors
dwelling
within
i
say
pass
on
the
guinness
draught
and
go
for
a
brew
with
some
taste
ddue
to
low
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
my
goto
session
beer
when
i
dont
feel
like
going
the
the
beer
store
with
a
wide
selection
this
is
my
grocerystore
beer
of
choice
this
beer
just
isnt
as
good
as
what
i
remember
it
being
d
its
pretty
much
like
water
so
it
gets
a
5
if
you
are
looking
at
bud
lights
definition
of
drinkability
it
is
a
very
good
beer
drink
with
a
smooth
hint
of
coffee
at
the
finish
enjoyed
this
beer
d
this
is
the
ultimate
drinkable
stout
low
abv
and
smooth
flavor
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
pure
drinkability
it
goes
well
with
anything
from
breakfast
to
a
midnight
snack
cheers
d
low
abv
small
bottles
and
a
solid
taste
is
good
enough
for
me
drinkability
was

served
in
a
stout
glass

suggested
extra
cold
has
a
dark
brown
cola
color
with
a
thin
pale
tan

smell
is
slightly
of
cola
taste
is
mildly
reflecting
burnt
toast
and
hazelnut
lacking
much
flavor
possibly
to
make
it
more
comparable
to
macro
beers
beer
has
mouthfeel
almost
like
carbonated
slurpy
consitency
or
that
of
sucking
on
an
ice
cube
while
by
no
means
an
exceptional
stout
its
by
no
means
offensive
a
mild
and
drinkable
beer
with
a
how
low
can
you
go
abv
to
boot
stay
away
from
this
one
overall
impression
this
beer
is
sexy
and
seductive
d
decent
session
brew
light
body
makes
it
very
drinkable
lack
of
complexity
made
me
want
a
regular
guinness
drinkability
its
still
a
guinness
and
therefore
worth
your
hard
earned
dollars
its
not
going
to
be
your
perfect
pour
finished
off
somewhat
bitter
the
beer
was
pretty
smooth
overall
creamy
while
drinking
and
dry
after
the

it
is
not
bad
serving
type
bottle
d
this
is
a
very
disappointing
example
of
guinness
this
is
probably
the
reason
why
people
think
dark
beer
is
shitty
poured
out
a
decent
head
that
never
receded
and
left
spotty
traces
of
beige
lace
guinness
always
has
great
head
retention
but
head
size
seems
to
lack
when
served
from
anywhere
but
the
tap
the
color
is
a
solid
opaque
black
has
a
unique
aroma
that
is
distinct
to
guinness
lightly
sweet
smokey
malty
bready
and
slight
hop
notes
detected
in
the
smell
the
taste
has
a
very
dry
smokey
flavor
like
you
just
got
done
licking
an
ashtray
it
is
slightly
sweet
but
has
along
dry
finish
and
a
touch
of
a
lingering
faint
bitterness
mouthfeel
lacks
in
carbonation
which
is
usual
with
guinness
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
and
lacks
any
body
for
such
a
dark
beer
the
texture
is
as
usual
very
creamy
and
always
goes
down
smooth
it
is
very
drinkable
but
i
find
myself
only
drinking
it
a
few
random
times
throughout
the
year
i
love
it
at
st
pattys
day
as
does
everyone
else
when
i
was
in
ireland
i
drank
it
the
whole
week
it
did
have
a
different
taste
over
there
which
if
i
remember
was
a
bit
hoppier
and
maybe
more
carbonated
its
in
a
class
by
itself
and
it
is
what
it
is
theres
no
changing
it
now
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
the
guinness
extra
stout
which
is
sold
for
about
the
same
price
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
feel
may
not
be
the
best
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
a
good
beer
to
have
if
you
want
only
one
or
two
edit
sorry
i
didnt
even
feel
like
giving
this
a
real
review
go
get
a
real
beer
it
looks
like
a
guinness
draught
but
is
a
little
lighter
it
has
a
roasted
barley
nose
to
it
just
like
guinness
draught
the
taste
is
where
they
seperate
in
comparison
it
had
a
metallically
almost
flat
taste
simmilar
to
that
of
an
ice
cube
maybe
too
cold
to
have
any
flavor

it
makes
it
extra
special
wen
the
person
pouring
knows
how
to
pouring
a
guinness
and
watching
as
the
head
forms
changing
colour
from
chocolate
to
a
brwnish
foam
is
a
show
but
im
used
to
tap
or
special
export
and
found
this
one
bland
smell
of
coffee
and
roasted
light
in
the
palate
and
very
watery
taste
of
coffee
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
pepper
i
miss
the
alcohol
of
the
special
export
the
beer
that
basically
changed
my
thought
process
on
beer
poured
black
into
a
20oz
guinness
pint
with
a
dense
white
head
in
the
nose
hints
of
coffee
and
hops
light
in
the
palate
but
filling
and
bitter
a
great
first
step
into
beer
by
realizing
different
tastes
and
colors
pure
advertising
but
if
you
like
the
tap
handle
go
for
it
i
recommend
that
if
in
ireland
you
seek
extra
cold
out
cant
see
why
anyone
would
want
this
in
preference
to
standard
guinness
probably
sounded
good
to
the
marketing
boys
in
the
board
room
sorry
guys
not
for
me
no
improvement
still
a
good
brew
as
guinness
is
one
of
my
favorite
mass
produced
beers
o
i
appreciate
that
it
is
thicker
and
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
regular
guinness
but
i
wish
some
of
the
off
flavors
werent
there
i
can
do
a
pint
or
two
once
a
year
but
not
much
beyond
that
hopefully
its
better
on
tap
overall
it
wasnt
bad
it
had
many
guinness
extra
stout
qualities
like
taste
and
smell
with
a
little
more
carbonation
but
this
wasnt
like
the
bottles
of
extra
stout
i
had
20
years
ago
simple
and
plain
but
very
drinkable
stout
ive
actually
got
to
the
point
where
the
draught
guinness
tastes
too
creamy
for
me
and
now
this
is
the
one
that
i
turn
to
when
i
want
a
good
old
guinnness
sure
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
the
american
stouts
but
it
tastes
great
and
thats
all
that
really
matters
one
glaring
flaw
of
this
guy
however
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
rather
watery
even
compared
to
the
draught
guinness
lite
brother
better
than
the
american
standard
for
guinness
not
as
good
as

and
the
overall
flavour
profile
is
unlikely
to
appeal
to
most
bas
given
its
pedestrian
qualities
and
annoying
sweetness
ill
probably
use
the
rest
of
these
bottles
in
blackandtan
experiments
its
not
a
style
i
care
for
but
this
still
leaves
something
to
be
desired

have
to
wonder
if
this
is
what
the
real
extra
stout
really
tastes
like
being
licensed
by
labatt
to
be
brewed
in
canada
does
not
fill
me
with
any
amount
of
certainty
overall
its
better
than
a
guinness
draught
but
nothing
exemplary
about
it
its
better
than
original
draught
and
tastes
bigger
it
is
6
but
it
still
manages
to
exhibit
that
cheap
corn
essence
a
bit
in
the
nose
and
in
flavor
its
not
bad
giving
an
even
3
is
probably
a
touch
generous
it
may
not
please
the
beer
snobs
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
such
a
smooth
delicious
beer
deep
dark
and
black
as
midnight
fat
creamy
head
nicely
bittered
finish
goes
down
so
smooth
and
tasty
first
time
i
have
had
one
in
about
two
years
and
i
like
it
even
more
today
an
alright
beer
i
found
it
quite
a
bit
more
bitter
than
a
guinnes
draught
and
less
creamy
but
then
again
they
arent
the
same
beer
so
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
goes
well
with
a
spicy
kebab
roasted
malt
bitterness
thinner
and
creamy
mouthfeel
good
for
the
type
of
beer
not
my
fav
but
good
a
great
common
beer
can
be
found
almost
everywhere
and
is
relatively
inexpensive
awesome
black
color
with
a
substantial
head
when
poured
head
does
not
dissipate
quickly
like
in
some
stouts
which
is
good
taste
is
slightly
bitter
always
a
decent
treat
this
is
my
favorite
guinness
rich
full
bodied
and
smooth
ever
since
i
first
had
this
beer
its
definitely
been
one
of
my
favorites
for
casual
session
drinking
the
flavor
is
unique
and
quite
tasty
plus
its
a
guinness
and
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
those
great
irishmen
who
pioneered
so
much
of
beer
history
v
good
standard
beer
cheap
and
easily
available
o
good
stout
that
i
like
every
bit
as
much
as
the
original
guinness
metallic
flavor
throws
me
a
bit
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
3

overall
its
almost
universally
agreed
that
this
is
better
than
guinness
draught
but
i
honestly
like
that
one
more
this
is
a
bigger
stout
with
more
aggressive
flavors
but
guinness
draught
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
want
a
guinness
and
when
i
want
to
make
a
black
tan
or
make
a
stout
cake
or
do
any
of
the
other
great
things
you
can
do
with
this
beloved
beer
all
that
aside
guinness
extra
is
fine
it
just
doesnt
make
me
forget
all
the
other
great
stouts
in
the
world
soil
mushroom
burnt
coffee
long
bitter
finish
bottle
of
guinness
extra
drank
full
body
heavy
mouth
feel
filling
milky
finish
good
amount
of
bitter
to
balance
the
flavor
its
the
baseline
stout
never
a
bad
idea
on
a
good
tap
almost
like
cream
pours
in
to
a
madra
rua
proper
guinness
pint
glass
with
an
opaque
dark
color
nearly
black
but
not
quite
mahogany
and
crimson
highlights
are
around
the
base
of
the
glass
and
where
the
light
hits
it
just
right
the
chunky
towering
beige
head
recedes
very
slowly
leaving
mountainous
peaks
and
plateaus
near
the
rim
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
raisin
cola
and
dark
breadlike
qualities
faint
molasses
is
present
as
well
its
an
intoxicatingly
delicious
combination
but
not
overpowering
by
any
means
the
taste
brings
black
coffee
astringency
with
a
little
limelike
citrus
bitterness
from
the
combination
of
blackened
malts
and
earthy
hops
its
smoky
and
roasty
with
an
herbal
tobacco
nature
drying
in
the
finish
almost
puckering
its
flavorful
yet
refined
with
a
body
that
coats
the
palate
yet
remains
moderate
this
one
strikes
a
good
balance
if
not
for
the
creamy
carbonation
it
might
lack
some
depth
overall
this
is
extremely
easy
to
quaff
especially
for
such
a
boldly
flavored
brew
at
6
abv
it
retains
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
guinness
extra
stout
is
distinctly
excellent
a
quintessential
irish
dry
stout
that
still
serves
a
measuring
stick
for
the
style
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
smells
like
fresh
coffee
tastes
like
coffee
pretty
much
as
well
and
while
it
is
very
bold
and
bitter
its
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
compared
to
the
guinness
draught
it
is
bigger
and
better
in
essentially
every
way
most
noticeably
with
regards
to
taste
and
mouth
feel
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
my
go
to
beer
smooth
feel
and
taste
and
low
carb
count
so
you
can
drink
all
night
long
more
earthy
and
nutty
than
regular
guinness
its
chocolatey
with
dark
fruit
and
a
mildly
tart
finish
tastes
like
a
normal
guinness
stout
better
than
the
original
guinness
but
i
have
the
same
complaint
about
it
looking
way
better
than
it
tastes
not
bad
for
the
beginners
okay
stout
i
think
it
is
guinness
better
beer
to
many
better
stouts
to
drink
then
this
very
weak
stout
bitter
taste
not
to
plesent
however
its
cheap
what
hasnt
been
said
isnt
this
the
gateway
beer
for
many
beer
snobs
my
take
on
this
classic
alternate
to
adjunct
lagers
is
that
it
beats
the
pants
off
of
bud
and
coors
but
takes
a
back
seat
to
nearly
every
stout
from
every
micro
brewery
out
there
the
look
is
obviously
unmatched
a
jet
black
body
with
the
everlasting
gobstopper
of
ale
froth
smell
is
hard
to
find
and
taste
is
smooth
yet
slightly
metallic
for
my
tastes
if
all
you
know
is
american
corn
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
otherwise
move
on
and
find
the
foreign
variety
of
their
stout
now
thats
a
world
class
beer
classic
and
full
bodied
stout
with
one
going
a
long
way
this
beer
has
an
interesting
sourness
to
it
that
i
later
found
out
is
actually
soured
beer
added
to
the
finished
product
wonderful
moderately
roasted
stout
o
love
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
on
this
and
the
fullness
makes
it
satisfying
a
very
approachable
stout
guinness
draught
has
a
better
overall
feel
v
medium
value
best
option
if
you
wanna
drink
a
guinness
ill
be
drinking
this
year
round
now
that
im
back
on
it
not
as
good
as
the
original
guinness
pours
dark
brown
with
a
nice
khaki
head
that
lingers
throughout
smells
like
creamy
chocolate
and
tobacco
tastes
like
bananas
coffee
chocalate
and
a
nice
maduro
cigar
feels
creamy
and
smooth
but
not
to
the
same
levels
as
regular
guiness
overall
a
really
nice
stout
that
tastes
a
little
more
like
a
porter
than
others
ah
good
old
guinness
ubiquitous
stout
thats
extremely
drinkable
at
about
any
temperature
and
often
the
only
stout
available
in
restaurant
chains
and
sports
bars
where
domestic
pilsners
reign
supreme
a
wonderfully
crafted
stout
beer
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
i
just
cant
drink
it
warm
i
havent
had
guinness
in
years
but
i
remember
loving
it
in
my
youth
i
decided
to
go
back
to
it
and
rate
it
since
i
havent
gotten
around
to
trying
it
again
until
now
its
slightly
lighter
than
i
remember
my
tactile
memories
telling
me
that
drinking
this
is
the
past
was
like
consuming
liquid
breakfast
the
dark
flavor
and
creamy
head
i
still
remembered
well
and
i
definitely
like
it
this
is
a
really
good
stout
and
theres
a
reason
why
its
popularity
persists
to
this
day
i
will
try
to
drink
this
again
in
the
near
future
and
maybe
then
ill
add
to
this
review
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
stronger
and
more
complex
version
of
the
guinness
draught
a
stronger
aroma
and
nice
dark
fruits
added
to
the
profile
it
is
around
50
more
expensive
at
65
a
case
of
24
x
375ml
but
i
think
its
worth
it
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
not
many
stouts
can
touch
it
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
metallic
taste
nice
frothy
head
great
aroma
nice
taste
but
over
whelming
metal
taste
why
idk
so
so
good
great
all
the
way
overall

this
beer
is
fantastic
i
like
it
a
lot
and
its
popular
for
a
reason
great
stout
has
a
bit
too
much
hops
but
the
bourbon
sweetness
makes
it
worthwhile
love
the
licorice
too
big
fan
of
black
licorice
and
i
like
it
in
my
stouts
try
it
if
you
havent
yet
and
who
hasnt
overall
this
is
excellent
if
you
are
a
fan
of
guinnesss
products
like
myself
you
must
try
this
if
you
like
the
different
stouts
from
around
the
world
but
never
tried
the
extra
stout
youll
like
it
its
a
sweeter
boldersharper
in
flavor
than
guinness
draught
and
its
richer
in
body
go
get
you
some
12oz
bottle
from
my
local
meijer
coming
from
a
stout
beginner
this
beer
strikes
me
for
its
toasty
malts
and
ammonia
notes
and
great
lacing
a
pleasant
subtle
numbness
and
warmth
create
a
great
mouthfeel
tobacco
ultradark
roast
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
round
out
the
flavor
profile
to
provide
an
enjoyable
complex
stout
this
one
has
made
up
my
mind
that
i
dont
care
for
dry
stouts
at
all
way
better
than
the
draught
version
the
carbon
dioxide
gives
it
a
stronger
and
fuller
taste
than
its
nitrogen
counterpart
this
is
closer
to
the
original
stout
that
arthur
guinness
would
have
produced
first
day
o
an
old
favorite
full
and
tasty
if
it
is
fresh
and
well
handled
this
shows
why
guinness
is
stout
for
so
many
people
bottle
pours
dark
black
with
offwhite
head
aroma
of
malts
and
corn
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
a
little
bit
of
roasted
coffee
and
malts
very
light
bodied
for
a
stout
easily
drinkable
not
my
favorite
but
makes
we
wish
i
were
in
ireland
dark
and
lingering
this
beer
is
an
archetype
to
compare
other
stouts
with
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
bottled
on
4242014
pours
nearly
pitch
black
color
with
a
2
finger
dense
and
rocky
khaki
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lasts
dense
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
a
moderate
amount
of
streaming

retaining
the
head
aromas
of
chocolate

roasted

dark

dark

mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
dry
stout
all
around
good
complexity
and
balance
of
darkroasted
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
another
one
my
favorites
definitely
do
not
confuse
or
compare
this
to
the
draught
original
is
so
much
better
just
great
rich
coffee
character
you
just
have
to
like
this
one
overall
i
have
to
compare
this
to
their
draught
as
it
is
what
is
on
tap
everywhere
its
better
the
mouthfeel
is
much
thicker
which
is
one
of
my
few
complaints
about
their
draught
the
taste
is
all
around
a
little
bit
stronger
although
the
sour
end
takes
some
getting
used
to
on
the
other
hand
the
draught
is
probably
easier
to
drink
if
you
are
not
used
to
stouts
the
original
guinness
is
my
baseline
for
stouts
pours
dark
to
the
point
of
blackness
with
a
smooth
creamy
head
that
gives
off
smells
of
coco
coffee
and
molasses
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
but
not
overly
so
o
a
very
solid
irish
stout
4
255

overall
deeper
and
much
more
complex
than
the
draught
beefier
mouth
feel
as
well
this
is
a
rather
good
stout
with
great
flavour
and
nice
warmth
i
will
default
to
extra
stout
rather
than
draught
when
possible
good
when
i
want
something
dark
good
flavor
had
any
guinness
there
might
be
on
tap
while
on
honeymoon
with
my
wife
in
ireland
its
pretty
good
to
start
with
but
if
youve
ever
had
it
in
its
home
country
at
the
beginning
of
the
biggest
adventure
in
your
life
with
the
love
of
your
life
in
a
tiny
pub
with
a
two
minute
pour
and
fresh
salmon
supper
youd
probably
give
it
a
five
too
really
great
buttery
and
nutty
good
stuff
meh
overall
not
a
bad
stout
i
prefer
it
just
a
tad
below
room
temperature
because
i
find
it
smoother
but
maybe
thats
just
me
this
is
a
very
good
stout
o
the
first
couple
of
times
i
had
this
i
absolutely
loved
it
after
tasting
many
other
great
stouts
i
realize
this
brew
isnt
as
much
of
a
masterpiece
as
i
thought
it
was
its
still
a
very
good
beer
something
i
would
drink
whenever
3
5
first
beers
i
was
able
to
enjoy
my
all
time
favorite
stout
a
classic
beer
that
in
todays
world
of
craft
beers
and
hundreds
of
different
styles
still
holds
its
own
nice
to
know
some
things
will
never
change
cheers

into

14

pitch

with
a
small
of
white

of

with
a
bit
of
coffee
a
bit
of
a
different
combination
beer
is
light
bodied
and
heavily
carbonated
good
finish
overall
an
above
average
beer
i
think
that
this
is
a
bit
tastier
than
the
regular
guinness
draught
42
abv
but
still
i
would
very
much
like
to
try
this
on
tap
and
not
in
a
bottle
overall
i
say
this
was
a
good
stout
that
i
would
have
again
considering
ive
drank
aals
and
everything
else
and
every
other
beer
tastes
horrible
to
me
i
like
this
one
i
only
like
stouts
im
not
good
at
reviewing
beer
i
usually
review
bourbon
and
spirits
beer
is
not
something
i
keep
around
the
house
i
dont
like
it
but
this
one
i
like
i
cant
say
a
lot
beyond
that
its
sugary
watereddown
and
tastes
of
burned
malts
and
not
in
the
good
way
overall
yup
after
having
highly
rated
english
beers
and
now
this
i
am
officially
not
a
fan
of
english
style
beers
and
in
this
case
a
stout
too
much
caramel
malt
and
hardly
roasted
at
all
also
too
bitter
for
the
style
i
was
expecting
a
creamy
mouthfeel
atleast
since
thats
what
guinness
is
known
for
but
was
let
down
better
than
guinness
draught
but
thats
not
saying
much
at
all
glad
i
tried
it
once
but
will
not
return
again
unless
im
at
a
bar
and
the
only
other
beers
are
bmc
i
love
guiness
and
the
extra
stout
is
like
an
enhanced
version
of
the
draught
while
a
lot
of
people
complain
about
the
draughts
lack
in
distinct
flavor
the
extra
stout
gets
it
just
right
not
too
bitter
and
very
smooth
going
down
plus
it
has
that
dark
coffee
color
guiness
is
known
for
bad
things
there
may
be
beers
more
bitter
out
there
i
hope
never
to
run
into
them
my
rating
scale
of
drinkability
versus
bitterness
runs
from
1
to
guinness
its
almost
an
acrid
taste
that
takes
over
the
tongue
i
find
the
same
taste
occurs
in
grapefruit
and
bell
peppers
i
dont
remember
the
guinness
being
relatively
poor
pours
a
deep
clear
brown
almost
no
light
gets
through
there
is
about
two
fingers
of
pillowy
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
deep
malt
caramel
and
molasses
with
a
little
earthy
funk
to
it
the
taste
is
good
but
pretty
monochromatic
it
is
strictly
chocolate
malt
think
coffee
bean
roast
without
the
coffee
flavor
its
not
bad
but
there
isnt
anything
else
theres
a
good
weight
to
the
body
and
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
slight
bite
on
the
finish
a
very
good
stout
enjoy
o
not
too
bad
a
bit
too
heavy
not
quite
sweet
enough
but
still
a
good
brew
olots
of
good
flavors
i
love
the
balance
of
smoothness
flavor
and
strength
overall
extra
stout
is
brewed
in
canada
for
us
distribution
its
superior
to
any
other
low
alcohol
dry
stout
that
i
have
found
o
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
this
one
but
it
was
nice
to
come
back
to
one
of
the
go
to
stouts
for
me
when
sierra
nevada
stout
is
not
available
good
bitter
roasted
flavors
are
prevalent
with
a
nice
carbonation
and
lacing
in
the
glass
i
dont
think
the
aroma
does
the
look
and
taste
justice
although
the
nose
isnt
bad
it
could
be
better
as
it
just
does
not
stick
out
to
me
as
being
strong
enough
o
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
but
it
does
have
its
own
unique
place
in
how
this
obsession
got
started
for
me
i
like
it
much
more
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
but
i
still
find
it
too
overpowering
in
char
and
bitterness
a
dark
heavy
feeling
beer
i
liked
it
but
it
doesnt
smell
very
good
but
taste
makes
up
for
it
not
to
bitter
not
to
sweet
a
great
mixture
cost
compared
to
beers
of
equal
stature
is
comparable
at
8
49
a
six
pack
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
frequently
but
defiantly
a
worthy
beer
of
taste
o
a
great
stout
that
never
gets
old
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
its
also
a
nice
versatile
beer
to
cook
with
overall
i
fear
many
may
conflate
this
beer
with
guinness
draught
but
rest
assured
they
are
two
very
different
beers
this
is
a
great
easydrinking
stout
with
good
flavor
body
and
alcohol
presence
wont
knock
you
on
your
feet
but
has
considerably
more
body
than
guinness
draught
would
recommend
a
simple
yet
still
fairly
tasty
stout
o
wow
this
is
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
guinness
im
used
to
the
big
black
opaque
frothy
waaay
over
roasted
monster
this
beer
is
actually
nicely
balanced
and
has
a
depth
of
flavor
the
red
tints
in
such
a
dark
beer
are
quite
fascinating
in
fact
it
almost
tastes
like
an
amber
mixed
with
a
stout
i
may
have
to
buy
this
again
not
the
other
stuff
o
even
though
it
is
probably
no
longer
in
vogue
i
still
enjoy
a
guinness
from
time
to
time
reminds
of
my
early
days
into
drinking
beer
beyond
bmc
in
the
early
to
mid
1990s
sessionable
easy
to
drink
and
still
enjoyable
o
hard
to
berate
this
beer
its
a
classic
when
guinness
was
first
brewed
in
canada
there
was
a
noticeable
drop
in
quality
it
used
to
be
my
goto
stout
but
after
they
stopped
brewing
it
in
ireland
for
sale
in
usa
i
stopped
drinking
it
i
found
it
for
sale
at
my
local
grocery
store
and
decided
to
buy
it
in
honor
of
st
patricks
day
and
i
am
glad
to
give
a
thumbs
up
review
it
is
much
closer
to
the
ireland
brewed
version
and
is
quite
tasty
it
has
a
superb
balance
of
malt
and
hops
and
is
full
flavored
but
not
overwhelming
kudos
to
diageo
for
bringing
back
the
traditional
flavor
instead
of
some
ill
conceived
adaptation
to
american
taste
whats
there
not
to
like
about
a
well
poured
glass
of
guinness
stout
oh
my
goodness
my
guinness
not
normally
into
higher
end
beers
but
this
one
is
perfect
head
is
thick
and
creamy
goes
down
smooth
its
served
closer
to
room
temp
and
tastes
better
that
way
ive
bought
a
6
pack
before
but
cold
out
of
the
fridge
just
isnt
anywhere
nearly
as
good
best
by
far
of
all
stouts
ive
ever
had
rich
layered
taste
malted
barley
confidently
bitter
substantial
weight
flavors
leave
fairly
quickly
but
a
mild
malty
bitter
remains
minutes
later
o
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
however
there
are
quite
a
few
porters
and
dark
ales
that
i
would
choose
instead
probably
the
best
guinnessmade
product
on
the
shelves
still
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
remember
strongly
disliking
guiness
in
my
younger
days
but
this
beer
here
is
a
very
enjoyable
stout
if
not
for
the
disappointing
nose
id
say
this
beer
was
great
much
more
roasty
malt
character
than
the
original
great
depth
of
flavor
theres
a
minerally
quality
that
is
slightly
offputting
oit
is
a
great
beer
and
a
must
drink
on
tap
i
am
not
as
appreciative
of
the
flavor
while
in
a
bottle
for
best
results
get
a
plane
ticket
and
head
to
ireland
i
would
not
suggest
drinking
this
over
and
over
goodnight
my
babies
o
its
been
a
very
long
time
since
i
first
had
this
beer
but
after
several
thousand
different
types
of
beer
in
between
it
still
seems
to
have
some
nice
complexities
and
is
very
much
sessionable
its
definitely
a
lot
more
interesting
compared
to
the
draught
version
mouthfeel
is
not
as
smooth
as
the
other
guinnesses
i
am
disappointed
by
this
id
say
this
is
actually
a
very
mouth
drying
beer
overall
it
is
difficult
to
review
a
beer
that
is
so
iconic
is
it
possible
to
view
a
1965
porsche
911
and
be
completely
objective
about
the
design
no
ive
been
enjoying
this
beer
for
many
many
years
to
my
palate
this
is
the
stout
which
all
others
stouts
are
measured
against
overall
a
good
dark
colored
beer
but
lacking
the
boldness
aroma
and
flavor
of
a
stout
o
at
the
end
of
the
day
guinness
extra
stout
is
my
goto
sixpacks
of
it
are
easy
to
find
theyre
cheap
and
a
beer
this
dark
usually
scares
away
the
bmc
drinkers
and
keeps
them
from
snagging
one
of
my
bottles
while
im
not
looking
while
im
not
out
here
praising
guinness
as
the
best
beer
in
the
world
because
its
not
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
spend
more
money
on
guinness
than
i
do
any
other
beer
in
the
world
very
solid
very
affordable
very
worth
it
every
time
the
mouthfeel
is
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
its
rich
and
creamy
it
has
a
full
taste
that
envelops
your
taste
buds
like
a
snuggie
i
remember
the
first
time
i
had
an
extra
stout
i
was
new
to
beer
and
just
getting
my
feet
wetit
seemed
over
powering
at
the
time
fast
forward
to
now
and
by
luck
some
friends
purchased
me
a
case
of
it
and
never
one
to
look
a
gift
house
in
the
mouth
i
decided
to
get
reacquainted
with
one
of
irelands
most
famous
exports
big
change
in
opinion
it
is
a
great
option
for
being
a
standby
beer
in
my
opinion
from
the
classic
dark
brown
body
to
the
creamy
head
the
wonderful
yeasty
finish
and
aftertaste
and
it
is
far
better
at
4550
degrees
where
the
yeastiness
really
shines
well
worth
it
for
a
less
expensive
option
compared
to
my
normal
fare
o
a
pretty
decent
stout
and
an
improvement
on
the
original
but
not
a
great
beer
that
being
said
its
easy
to
drink
has
enough
flavor
and
is
easy
to
find
20oz
pint
glass
victoria
gastro
pub
columbia
md
overall
not
a
bad
irish
dry
stout
by
any
means
this
has
a
rather
light
body
making
this
a
great
session
stout
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
bit
too
sour
up
front
for
my
liking
this
is
certainly
a
classic
and
is
worth
enjoying
every
once
in
awhile
overall
very
good
beer
not
as
good
as
the
foreign
extra
stout
but
pretty
close
overall
this
is
good
i
was
expecting
a
drain
pour
but
i
like
this
the
points
go
to
the
draft
deduct
1
0
for
the
bottle
o
smooth
drinkable
stout
not
complex
in
any
way
but
doesnt
need
to
be
drink
with
any
meal
at
cellar
temperature
and
enjoy
this
is
still
a
brew
i
wont
refuse
i
will
have
a
few
today
its
guinness
and
if
your
not
familiar
with
the
brand
it
is
kind
of
the
average
beer
drinkers
exotic
brew
choice
when
their
not
tossing
back
bud
or
a
coors
its
the
original
fancy
beer
of
the
masses
which
in
my
beerpinion
is
best
out
the
tap
not
from
a
bottle
at
just
cooler
than
50
degrees
my
preference
its
really
creamy
and
smooth
not
much
else
though
very
simple
and
straight
forward
which
is
likely
the
reason
people
seem
to
like
it
so
much
its
just
ez
to
drink
i
prefer
a
anchor
steam
porter
myself
but
find
that
if
i
am
a
family
function
guinness
is
likely
the
only
reputable
and
readily
available
alternative
guinness
isnt
bad
it
has
a
great
velvety
mouthfeel
a
nice
looking
head
properly
poured
guinness
looks
like
a
work
of
art
taste
wise
while
its
nice
and
bitter
theres
a
strange
funk
in
the
background
it
could
have
just
been
poor
cleanliness
on
the
part
of
the
somewhat
crappy
sports
bar
i
tried
it
in
and
given
a
chance
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
that
said
when
it
comes
to
dark
beers
i
almost
always
recommend
you
try
a
local
brew
first
overall
rather
impressed
being
that
it
is
one
of
my
first
stouts
i
have
tried
wasnt
sure
i
would
like
it
but
as
i
kept
drinking
i
acclimated
to
the
taste
and
enjoyed
it
overall
the
pitch
black
color
was
great
o
like
a
watered
down
version
of
the
foreign
extra
a
lot
smoother
it
would
pair
well
with
a
wider
variety
of
foods
i
like
it
and
could
see
having
it
at
pub
with
food
this
version
was
produced
in
shanghai
i
have
a
love
hate
relationship
with
guinness
i
love
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
the
appearance
absolutely
love
the
aforementioned
then
we
get
to
the
taste
horrible
i
hate
it
it
is
extremely
bitter
to
my
pallet
i
can
drink
it
and
if
there
is
nothing
else
on
tap
as
in
it
is
literally
the
only
thing
available
i
would
drink
nothing
i
want
to
love
it
i
love
everything
else
about
it
but
its
soooo
bitter
to
me
cheers
and
peace
to
all
o
good
but
doesnt
stand
out
certainly
better
than
regular
guinness
at
least
bottled
regular
guinness
its
worthy
of
a
drink
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
o
it
isnt
a
bad
stout
and
has
good
flavors
as
it
warms
up
the
alcohol
is
more
present
but
the
bitterness
becomes
less
obvious
its
roasted
notes
come
out
more
as
it
warms
up
and
the
flavors
of
a
dark
mocha
drink
become
more
present
it
did
however
have
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
towards
the
end
once
the
beer
began
to
warm
up
not
a
bad
beer
would
love
to
try
this
out
on
tap
since
it
probably
wont
have
that
metallic
aftertaste
that
the
beer
acquired
after
sitting
there
for
a
couple
minutes
ah
guinness
sometimes
its
good
to
go
back
to
something
you
knew
well
its
everything
a
stout
should
be
and
theres
a
reason
its
so
ubiquitous
cheers
to
good
health
and
good
beer
i
would
be
more
apt
to
drink
this
in
the
winter
rather
than
summer
its
summer
now
so
i
dont
think
i
can
appreciate
the
tones
fully
very
dark
cola
color
with
a
great
mocha
head
smell
is
oats
wheat
lager
and
earthy
skunk
taste
is
roasted
malt
bitter
earthy
hops
slight
cocoacoffee
roast
bitter
and
dry
in
the
finish
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
i
am
not
super
familiar
with
this
style
so
i
cannot
say
if
it
is
pure
to
the
style
also
i
have
heard
that
guinness
has
watered
down
changed
etc
their
beers
i
dont
know
i
really
liked
the
beer
it
tasted
good
it
looked
good
and
it
smelled
good
the
mouth
feel
was
a
bit
disappointing
and
maybe
that
is
the
watering
down
but
on
the
whole
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
doesnt
like
the
taste
of
chinese
food
in
their
beer
the
dark
color
looks
like
chocolate
but
does
not
taste
like
chocolate
liquor
or
chocolate
or
coffee
anything
i
was
excited
to
try
something
new
but
i
was
not
satisfied
with
guiness
extra
stout
i
will
try
a
regular
guiness
although
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
in
color
almost
black
thin
eggshell
colored
head
aromas
of
chocolate
liqueur
taste
begins
with
a
smoky
woody
flavor
then
a
little
brown
sugar
sweetness
finishing
with
a
slightly
sour
herbal
piney
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
overall
a
nice
stout
though
i
prefer
the
foreign
extra
better
i
had
very
little
experience
with
stouts
before
buying
this
beer
however
it
was
st
patricks
day
and
it
seemed
appropriate
the
dark
hue
and
thick
brown
head
make
this
beer
looking
creamy
and
inviting
however
it
is
very
bitter
and
fullbodied
this
can
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
your
taste
in
beer
i
didnt
enjoy
the
first
one
but
by
the
end
of
the
6
pack
i
thought
it
to
be
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
it
stands
up
well
against
a
stew
or
with
steak
o
i
prefer
this
to
the
draught
a
simple
very
drinkable
light
stout
bought
a
six
pack
recently
appearance
has
some
brownblack
look
with
a
frothy
head
and
thick
lacing
on
the
side
there
is
a
light
roasted
aroma
of
hazelnut
chocolate
raisin
and
malt
nice
taste
with
a
sweet
malt
mixed
with
hints
of
dark
coffee
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
to
this
it
was
a
good
creamy
drink
but
it
was
not
too
heavy
thanks
to
the
carbonation
overall
pretty
darn
good
o
this
is
a
bit
underwhelming
out
of
the
bottle
though
for
such
a
widely
distributed
dark
beer
it
is
nice
enough
no
huge
malt
complexities
and
it
drinks
quite
light
and
crisp
i
know
that
i
have
a
problem
rating
some
stouts
today
ive
been
drinking
many
of
those
large
abvs
with
loads
of
chocolate
orand
coffee
they
are
in
a
different
category
style
then
this
one
so
i
need
to
keep
that
in
perspective
o
wish
i
was
reviewing
this
on
nitro
tap
feel
like
im
a
giving
this
a
worse
rating
than
it
deserves
or
that
ive
just
been
drinking
high
quality
stuff
recently
but
just
not
impressed
appreciate
guinness
for
a
lot
of
things
in
my
early
beer
drinking
days
but
probably
wont
drink
this
more
than
once
a
year
that
said
i
will
drink
a
lot
of
it
once
a
year
cheers
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
over
the
past
few
years
i
have
drank
a
lot
of
dark
beer
but
extra
stout
is
among
the
best
this
beer
is
balanced
and
drinkable
and
has
a
quality
to
it
that
lots
of
commercial
industrial
produced
beer
does
not
by
far
my
favorite
guinness
offering
and
a
great
introduction
to
the
world
of
stouts
and
porters
extra
stout
should
be
drunk
with
heavy
meat
dishes
thick
hamburgers
or
spicy
chili
not
really
a
session
beer
it
nevertheless
works
as
some
great
reward
for
a
particularly
rough
day
or
a
black
celebration
cheers
a
nice
dry
stout
flavors
are
strong
and
blend
well
two
words
guinness
period
meaning
its
a
standard
offering
nothing
special
no
drawbacks
overall
if
im
ever
limited
to
guinness
at
a
noncraft
sort
of
place
id
take
this
over
the
original
draught
overall
not
bad
for
a
basic
stout
would
drink
again
sure
there
are
better
options
out
there
but
for
7
99
a
sixer
its
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
one
from
time
to
time
the
taste
picks
up
right
from
the
smell
but
then
whoa
the
roasted
finish
its
like
the
fruits
are
darker
than
the
esterlike
aspect
of
them
in
the
smell
and
they
blend
and
leadin
to
the
dry
finish
in
a
nice
way
i
get
sweet
dry
roast
out
of
this
brew
and
somewhat
astringent
puckering
earthy
id
enjoy
this
beer
more
if
it
the
grains
didnt
come
off
so
astringent
to
me
throughout
this
pint
i
drank
there
was
a
lingering
aspect
of
what
is
termed
as
acetaldehyde

best
experience
with
guinness
was
recently
when
i
got
the
first
pour
from
a
fresh
keg
this
may
color
my
review
but
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
the
pint
was
very
dark
with
a
thick
ultracreamy
head
excellent
retention
the
taste
is
unusually
good
for
a
run
of
the
mill
brew
with
a
stout
malty
coffee
flavor
with
a
sweet
caramel
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
what
was
remarkable
to
me
and
it
definitely
has
me
interested
in
seeking
out
the
foreign
extra
stout
to
see
what
this
longstanding
brewery
is
capable
of
although
weak
at
times
but
its
available
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style

just
want
a

overall
sure
there
are
better
beers
but
this
is
good
and
available
almost
everywhere
d
good
for
that
stout
mood
you
might
get
in
when
the
craft
store
is
closed
overall
a
pretty
nice
drink
and
i
would
like
to
try
the
version
brewed
in
ireland
instead
of
canada
before
a
give
this
much
criticism
food
match
for
compatriots
vegemite
on
toast
everyone
else
spit
roasted
pork
or
beef
casserole
with
potatoes
and
gravy
overall
its
not
a
style
im
all
that
fond
of
but
this
is
a
fine
example
anyway
its
a
good
goto
beer
when
youre
far
from
anywhere
and
there
are
only
convenience
stores
nearby
because
they
almost
always
have
it
overall
i
liked
it
but
then
again
i
like
stouts
and
their
strong
coffee
and
toasted
flavor
a
good
brew
for
those
who
just
arent
satisfied
with
the
normal
guinness
flavor
but
it
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
compared
to
other
dry
stouts
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
much
better
stout
than
the
draught
summary
i
prefer
this
guinness
over
the
popular
draught
the
extra
stout
is
very
tasty
but
it
is
a
bit
watery
which
helps
its
drinkability
i
suppose
overall
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
but
one
can
do
worse
i
hated
this
when
i
first
drank
beer
but
since
ive
been
into
beer
in
a
big
way
ive
come
to
enjoy
this
way
more
of
a
beer
than
standard
guinness
id
love
to
try
some
foreign
extra
sometime
soon
od
not
a
great
stout
i
typically
dont
dislike
guinness
as
much
as
i
did
with
this
seemed
off
and
weakmild
dr
affordable
by
irish
standards
and
if
i
remember
right
also
by
usa
standards
at
4
2
abvits
easy
drinking
and
quite
filling
but
also
low
calorie
the
name
can
be
misleading
as
foreign
extra
and
john
martin
import
are
closer
to
the
original
flavour
than
either
this
or
the
draught
but
it
remains
a
great
beer
certainly
worth
a
go
this
one
ended
up
being
strongest
on
appearance
my
perspective
of
the
beer
matches
this
it
has
a
strong
reputation
but
is
lacking
once
experienced
jh
surprisingly
light
body
for
how
black
it
is
overallnotes
well
there
you
have
it
now
i
guess
i
can
officially
say
im
a
beer
drinker
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
certainly
could
provide
a
good
alternative
while
barhopping
though
i
havent
tried
the
farmorecommon
draught
i
look
forward
to
more
of
these
in
the
future
overall
a
pretty
good
tasting
classic
stout
on
the
sweeter
side
but
pretty
good
actually
not
bad
black
with
a
tiny
head
very
malty
with
small
notes
of
coffee
maybe
some
chocolate
but
mostly
malt
quite
hoppy
for
a
stout
imo
bitter
aftertaste
that
im
not
so
fond
of
but
thats
just
me
something
that
i
could
drink
more
than
once
though
its
a
little
disappointing
that
they
want
you
to
think
its
from
ireland
when
its
actually
from
canada
but
the
taste
is
whats
important
i
suppose
overall
this
beer
lacks
the
flavor
complexity
found
in
superior
stouts
having
said
that
it
is
still
a
tasty
brew
which
i
find
myself
coming
back
to
time
and
again
when
im
on
a
slight
budget
its
not
the
best
stout
but
its
a
good
standby
which
can
be
found
almost
anywhere
in
the
beer
drinking
world
if
you
like
stouts
there
should
be
no
complaints
d
pretty
dense
and
strong
but
definitely
a
drinkable
stout
with
out
too
much
going
on
to
keep
me
from
coming
back
and
a
great
feeling
in
the
mouth
that
sets
it
up
well
alongside
food
overall
a
pretty
good
go
its
drinkable
and
it
holds
up
against
the
other
offerings
from
the
same
brewery
now
go
buy
some
taste
is
quite
mild
the
roastiness
cedes
to
overall
smoothness
and
a
mild
almost
oatmeal
type
of
integration
to
it
not
bitter
not
hoppy
would
like
more
something
chocolate
coffee
hops
bitter
roast
this
is
just
a
crowd
pleaser
drinkability
wish
it
was
a
little
more
dry
too
not
horrible
but
just
kind
of
there
even
the
extra
stout
needs
a
little
boost
in
the
ingredient
department
keep
the
recipe
the
same
just
more
of
everything
typical
guinness
pour
opaque
black
cascades
into
your
glass
light
tan
finger
of
head
that
recedes
a
bit
more
than
youd
expect
and
leaves
good
lacing
but
probably
not
quite
as
much
as
the
regular
draught
smooth
heavily
roasted
malt
aroma
with
some
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
same
in
the
taste
roasty
roasty
malts
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
bitterness
coffee
and
little
to
no
hops
though
perhaps
just
a
touch
of
a
floral
aspect
super
smooth
and
tasty
heavymedium
mouthfeel
and
nicely
drinkable
i
remember
back
in
the
day
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
the
thickest
chewiest
beast
of
a
beer
id
ever
seen
well
see
how
time
and
experience
have
treated
this
memory
the
erstwhile
beast
pours
a
deep
onyx
topped
by
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
dirty
light
tan
foam
man
i
miss
the
usual
guinness
cascade
but
this
is
still
pretty
in
its
own
right
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
rich
chocolate
syrup
light
molasses
and
a
dusting
of
coffee
the
taste
holds
notes
of
roasted
malts
light
cocoa
powder
very
light
coffee
and
a
strong
twinge
of
a
semisour
semibitter
more
toward
the
former
though
character
the
latter
lingers
on
a
bit
through
the
finish
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
chewy
feel
overall
though
not
as
beastly
as
i
remember
this
thing
can
still
hold
its
own
against
any
other
irish
stout
put
up
against
it
good
times
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
a
strong
stout
for
sure
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
certainly
worth
noting
tastes
a
tad
burnt
for
me
but
i
may
grow
to
like
it
a
good
medium
body
the
flavors
are
roasted
and
burnt
there
is
some
nondescript
sweetness
in
the
middle
followed
by
more
burnt
flavors
grain
some
bitter
hops
and
a
dry
finish
its
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
but
i
have
some
other
stouts
in
the
fridge
and
will
follow
this
with
one
of
those
i
think
this
beer
is
great
and
could
be
a
lot
better
the
one
thing
that
i
love
the
most
about
this
beer
is
the
smooth
creaminess
its
so
creamy
you
could
accidentally
drink
the
whole
beer
in
one
sip
the
only
disappointing
factor
to
it
is
the
fact
that
the
flavor
is
not
that
strong
its
there
for
a
little
bit
then
kind
of
fades
away
that
being
said
i
think
its
a
great
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
good
grub
and
what
not
its
not
so
much
as
a
dedicated
thickflavor
beer
in
my
opinion
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
i
have
been
eager
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
pitch
black
appearance
the
general
color
for
stouts
very
complex
beer
overall
however
is
a
acquired
taste
for
many
smooth
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
dominate
the
flavor
an
excellent
stout
overall
i
was
prepared
to
dismiss
this
beer
but
i
found
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
is
the
extra
stout
that
is
brewed
in
canada
for
us
distribution
o
it
tastes
good
like
a
nonwatered
down
version
of
guinness
draft
lacks
the
same
awesome
nitro
head
from
the
original
though
overall
this
was
a
descent
beer
everything
was
pretty
much
spot
on
for
the
style
from
the
pitch
black
look
to
the
pretty
dry
finish
the
flavors
were
ok
except
for
that
weird
metallic
taste
as
far
as
i
know
this
beer
was
pretty
traditional
and
true
to
its
style
but
i
cant
help
but
like
the
american
versions
more
they
just
have
much
more
flavor
and
depth
to
them
guinness
extra
stout
is
pretty
drinkable
for
a
dark
beer
some
people
claim
this
is
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
but
to
me
its
just
not
thick
and
flavorful
enough
to
live
up
to
that
claim
i
wont
seek
this
beer
out
but
if
i
was
at
a
bar
that
only
has
light
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
a
couple
of
these
i
feel
like
this
beer
might
be
better
in
a
nitro
can
and
i
will
have
to
try
it
someday
if
you
are
trying
to
get
into
dark
beers
this
might
be
a
good
place
to
start
overall
its
a
solid
beer
drinkable
and
reasonably
enjoyable
they
say
its
a
whole
other
beer
in
ireland
a
claim
i
hope
to
one
day
verify
d
not
bad
if
you
get
past
the
weird
sourness
flavors
are
pretty
decent
overall
this
is
a
nice
drink
it
does
down
easy
and
and
the
slightly
dry
finish
makes
you
yearn
for
me
its
moderate
alcohol
so
you
can
do
just
that
consumed
from
a
bottle
i
say
consumed
because
in
no
way
did
i
enjoy
it
this
beer
sucks
if
you
think
otherwise
youre
clearly
green
when
it
comes
to
beer
im
not
a
huge
guinness
fan
to
begin
with
but
take
away
the
creaminess
of
the
nitrogen
and
youve
got
beer
i
wouldnt
serve
to
my
enemy
d
i
coult
drink
more
but
its
slightly
strong
i
definatly
have
a
low
limit
with
this
beer
for
myself
if
i
drink
guinness
i
prefer
to
have
the
pub
can
or
the
nitro
tap
for
that
silky
mouth
feel
d
pretty
drinkable
but
not
overly
so
not
a
beer
im
ever
going
to
chug
but
i
could
drink
4
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
filling
up
or
getting
repulsed
by
it
6
might
be
too
much
if
im
being
a
bitch
overall
a
good
stout
i
tend
to
like
bigger
stouts
but
always
enjoy
a
guinness
a
larger
brewery
that
puts
out
a
lot
of
beer
that
does
it
well
pretty
rare
o
id
say
this
is
a
decent
beer
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
irish
stouts
to
compare
to
this
one
the
woodsy
malt
is
more
pronounced
and
it
is
much
sweeter
and
nuttier
i
see
why
they
spend
a
lot
on
trying
to
come
up
with
different
ways
to
keep
this
fresh
in
the
bottle
when
shipping
it
is
so
much
better
i
cant
drink
it
ever
since
i
got
back
to
the
us
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
and
prickly
a
far
cry
from
the
smoothness
of
the
nitro
of
draught
overall
a
pretty
good
choice
and
totally
worth
the
five
dollars
a
sixpack
a
local
store
was
running
these
on
special
nowhere
near
as
good
as
fes
which
is
my
goto
guinness
for
sure
but
this
is
surely
quaffable
big
amounts
of
burnt
toast
flavors
shower
your
tongue
on
each
sip
the
beer
is
black
much
like
most
of
the
guinness
products
this
ones
probably
the
strongest
they
have
put
out
that
i
know
of
its
about
double
the
abv
and
twice
as
rich
on
flavor
this
makes
very
good
beer
bread
also
this
pours
black
with
chunky
light
tan
head
it
isnt
as
creamy
as
it
is
on
tap
but
still
good
ive
always
liked
guinness
the
taste
is
toasty
and
sweet
with
a
little
bite
you
can
almost
taste
the
creaminess
the
low
carbonation
makes
it
one
of
the
easiest
beers
to
drink
in
my
opinion
medium
body
and
good
for
a
few
o
guinness
has
a
special
place
for
me
as
an
classic
gateway
to
porters
and
stouts
there
are
many
better
options
but
i
always
can
enjoy
a
good
guinness
stout
be
careful
when
pouring
this
beer
dont
be
to
aggressive
with
it
you
will
get
a
huge
head
i
was
able
to
pour
it
decently
and
i
got
about
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
the
head
is
a
little
creamy
a
little
soapy
it
disappears
much
as
soap
would
in
fact
i
have
never
seen
a
head
disappear
in
the
manner
its
very
strange
it
just
kind
of
disappears
in
patches
here
and
there
its
leaving
very
nice
lacing
though
the
body
is
pitch
black
even
when
held
up
to
the
light
im
very
confused
by
the
appearance
of
this
beer
but
it
does
look
good
it
smells
just
like
a
regular
guinness
to
me
except
with
more
alcohol
and
a
sourer
smell
the
sour
is
really
overpowering
in
the
smell
quite
frankly
still
smells
pretty
good
though
wow
im
not
liking
this
taste
at
all
the
first
thing
you
get
is
the
sour
taste
and
then
that
taste
leads
you
into
a
wine
taste
the
beer
tastes
like
strait
wine
finally
after
the
wine
taste
passes
you
get
a
gross
unidentified
aftertaste
i
cant
really
describe
it
but
its
gross
hidden
in
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
malt
taste
which
makes
it
bearable
really
not
impressed
here
at
all
i
thought
i
would
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
mouthfeel
is
ok
nothing
too
special
there
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
but
whatever
drinkability
is
low
considering
it
tastes
gross
st
james
gate
second
best
to
st
petes
gate
in
my
opinion
anyone
who
turns
there
nose
up
to
a
fine
healthing
serving
of
guinness
needs
to
help
to
understand
the
finer
things
of
life
guinness
helped
to
solid
the
history
of
the
irish
yeah
baby
the
color
do
i
really
need
to
go
over
this
for
a
wonderful
traditional
beer
cmon
i
aint
doing
it
you
want
to
know
more
man
up
and
enjoy
d
great
way
to
end
the
night
d
its
big
full
and
wellbalanced
it
left
me
wanting
more
this
beer
is
proof
that
a
big
brewery
can
create
good
beer
on
a
large
scale
overall
much
better
than
the
draught
version
but
it
still
took
me
a
while
to
get
used
to
that
sour
dry
finish
otherwise
a
very
enjoyable
beer
this
is
the
real
guinness
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
your
average
stout
i
enjoy
a
guinness
and
317
happy
st
pattys
day
2011
raisin
hits
the
side
of
the
mouth
then
a
nice
sting
from
the
carbonation
clears
the
way
for
caramel
malt
flavor
finishes
dry
with
bitter
coffee
notes
this
is
an
excellent
stout
d
the
taste
is
somewhat
odd
if
you
can
get
past
the
weird
twangy
sourness
then
this
could
be
an
easy
drinker
md
this
is
probably
one
of
the
creamiest
beers
i
ever
had
nice
and
smooth
but
the
bad
aftertaste
and
extreme
dryness
it
leaves
makes
it
not
as
drinkable
as
i
would
have
imagined
pour
brings
a
blackbodied
brew
with
a
goodsized
light
tan
head
head
sticks
around
for
a
bit
before
fading
into
a
nice
cap
with
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
pretty
off
with
some
roast
and
chocolate
plus
a
bit
of
cardboard
slight
metallic
character
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
really
bad
its
metallic
and
oxidized
with
some
dry
roast
feel
is
metallic
just
not
a
very
good
beer
i
really
wish
theyd
only
make
the
foreign
extra
stout
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
classic
with
good
flavors
and
not
overwhelming
this
pours
a
beautiful
black
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
with
incredible
retention
and
good
lace
on
the
nose
there
are
wet
malts
wet
straw
maybe
wet
oats
wet
everything
and
toasted
malts
there
is
a
noticeable
lack
of
the
coffeechocolate
flavors
that
dominate
most
nondry
stouts
so
that
was
a
welcome
change
but
overall
the
nose
was
a
bit
muted
in
the
mouth
the
toasted
malts
took
over
with
the
wet
straw
kind
of
further
back
the
only
real
knock
on
this
beer
to
me
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
thin
and
watery
though
there
is
a
medium
finish
with
the
bitter
roast
sticking
around
a
bit
a
nice
beer
for
st
pattys
morning
in
chicago
which
is
exactly
what
i
used
it
for
drinkability
the
alcohol
with
lack
of
hop
complexity
and
mouthbody
to
balance
it
out
really
kills
this
beer
for
me
just
finally
tried
this
beer
bought
a
bottle
and
was
expecting
a
real
bitter
beer
poured
into
frosty
mug
and
not
too
much
foam
and
the
taste
was
a
bit
bitter
but
after
a
few
sips
bitterness
is
forgotten
goes
down
smooth
not
filling
no
bad
aftertaste
not
bad
not
great
either
drinkability
not
the
beer
i
was
hoping
based
on
my
memories
of
it
in
the
past
just
average
d
not
as
drinkable
as
guinness
draught
definitely
higher
than
most
rich
dark
color
black
but
i
can
see
some
light
thru
it
where
the
glass
thins
has
my
favorite
froth
for
this
style
thick
and
sticky
goes
nowhere
fast
and
the
color
looks
bread
smell
coffee
and
roastex
malts
tasts
good
with
coffee
and
dark
roasts
a
little
on
the
light
end
for
stouts
with
me
but
still
good
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
carbonation
is
ok
tastes
good
i
will
alwayz
enjoy
a
guinness
espexially
on
an
empty
stomach
but
not
my
first
choi
e
for
stouts
dheavy
beer
makes
for
alright
drinkablity
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
is
relatively
fair
price
for
something
that
is
exceptional
in
my
mind
this
is
exactly
what
guinness
should
taste
like
every
time
nearly
every
facet
of
this
beer
is
better
than
that
of
the
one
which
is
so
common
so
im
not
quite
sure
why
the
draught
variety
is
so
popular
since
this
is
supposedly
the
original
recipe
im
astounded
as
to
why
this
beer
isnt
as
widely
marketed
or
available
i
suppose
that
to
each
his
own
but
ill
stick
with
this
one
thank
you
ahh
the
standbye
classic
choice
of
the
boston
irish
pub
from
tap
it
comes
with
an
inch
or
two
of
tiny
bubbled
fine
froth
which
feels
like
velvet
dark
and
opaque
the
taste
is
milder
and
sweeter
than
the
appearance
hints
you
get
some
mild
malt
a
touch
of
caramel
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
it
feels
great
and
goes
down
easy
very
carbonated
and
full
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
stout
i
fairly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
expected
a
bit
more
flavor
to
it
though
its
bitterness
aftertaste
makes
it
less
favorable
compared
to
the
guinness
draught
which
is
easier
to
go
down
so
i
recommend
this
beer
for
the
fans
of
dark
stiff
beer
if
you
only
drink
light
beer
i
would
warn
against
it
drinkability
this
is
the
guinness
i
like
and
can
really
enjoy
the
solid
roasted
bitterness
proportions
make
this
brew
as
an
enjoyable
drink
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
bottle
the
abv
is
enough
to
feel
but
low
enough
to
drink
carbonation
is
not
an
issue
for
drinking
its
fairly
drinkable
i
know
a
stout
isnt
supposed
to
necessarily
be
a
session
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
be
reaching
for
another
extra
stout
in
the
future
overall
my
least
favorite
guinness
product
very
hard
to
drink
bitter
acidic
burnt
and
over
carbonated
pours
a
dark
brownblack
coffee
color
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
the
smell
is
roasted
coffee
almost
burnt
with
a
faint
chocolate
and
a
semisweet
malty
background
the
taste
right
from
the
start
was
surprisingly
flat
and
a
strong
remembrance
of
day
old
reheated
coffee
its
light
malty
and
a
weak
finish
of
chocolate
not
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
truly
believe
and
ll
repeat
what
has
been
said
before
if
i
was
in
ireland
and
this
was
fresh
of
the
tap
it
would
be
a
much
different
experience
it
is
not
bad
but
not
great
from
the
bottle
d
i
could
put
back
quite
a
few
of
these
but
then
again
im
a
stout
lover
i
enjoy
the
taste
the
beer
leaves
behind
and
dont
find
it
too
overpowering
i
also
think
that
it
tastes
pretty
damn
good
for
coming
out
of
a
bottle
bet
its
delicious
on
tap
drinkability
like
i
said
is
like
having
a
meal
i
can
drink
this
stout
for
breakfast
drink
ordered
a
second
so
its
an
easy
drink
even
though
its
very
bitter
and
heavy
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
classic
stout
appearance
low
carbonation
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
mediumbodied
smooth
this
is
much
better
than
the
bottled
guinness
draught
it
has
a
much
richer
flavor
and
is
big
on
roasted
malt
taste
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
higher
abv
and
thicker
mouthfeel
yet
still
decent
on
the
drinkability
scale
this
is
a
good
massproduced
stout
nothing
special
but
still
better
than
other
alternatives
and
its
easy
to
find
d
still
drinkable
i
mean
its
stil
a
stout
and
its
pretty
crisp
more
interesting
than
std
guinness
just
wish
the
burntness
wasnt
there
sooo
pumped
for
guinness
it
is
the
irish
beer
right
how
much
cooler
can
you
get
pop
the
top
smell
the
roastedness
then
took
a
swig
fucking
wow
i
felt
like
i
just
drank
burnt
toast
i
know
im
only
21
and
probably
havent
acquired
a
taste
for
stouts
yet
but
how
could
you
ever
drink
more
than
one
of
these
puppies
i
had
trouble
finishing
one
i
appreciate
a
good
beer
but
this
was
just
rough
sorry
guys
just
my
opinion
at
least
it
smellslooks
cool
d
i
had
no
problem
putting
this
down
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
drinkability
i
arbitrarily
rated
this
a
little
high
its
just
such
a
pleasant
experience
when
im
in
the
mood
for
one
of
these
ill
probably
crack
open
a
second
maybe
even
a
third
but
this
is
dense
its
filling
and
its
way
above
average
in
terms
of
alcohol
content
so
no
this
is
not
a
session
beer
even
a
whole
sixpack
of
say
sierra
nevada
would
go
down
easier
than
a
whole
sixpack
of
this
this
beer
is
not
very
smooth
for
a
stout
its
pretty
good
but
nothing
amazing
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
stiff
black
malt
bitterness
along
with
a
bone
dry
finish
it
doesnt
seem
too
complex
basically
black
patent
and
chocolate
malts
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
black
malt
flavor
bitter
and
earthy
there
is
little
depth
besides
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
irish
stout
its
basic
yet
smooth
and
easy
drinking
d
ten
times
more
drinkable
than
regular
guinness
for
what
that
is
worth
one
finger
head
that
diminishes
quickly
the
smell
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
nice
roasty
aroma
with
hints
of
coffee
dont
like
the
way
this
hits
my
mouth
at
all
starts
to
fizzy
and
ends
too
dry
tastes
like
chocolate
covered
raisin
stout
very
disappointed
because
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
stout
poured
a
warm
opaque
black
with
a
mild
offwhite
head
mottled
medium
lacing
disappointing
smell
more
like
a
cheap
lager
than
a
stout
sort
of
corny
and
acidic
sourish
a
little
roasty
with
banana
notes
taste
crisp
and
dry
fairly
smooth
without
being
too
thin
displeasingly
gassy
for
a
stout
though
almost
like
an
adjunct
lager
or
cola
twangy
lingering
metallic
sourness
is
noticeable
and
a
hardwater
sort
of
character
especially
if
you
sample
it
alongside
other
stouts
i
paired
this
against
an
old
38
stubborn
bitter
aftertaste
clings
on
the
outbreath
some
chocolate
notes
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
but
to
me
this
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
character
it
tastes
distinctly
like
a
massmanufactured
beer
too
hard
watery
sour
and
fizzy
the
drinkability
really
isnt
so
bad
i
wouldnt
turn
one
away
but
its
nothing
special
im
surprised
how
kind
the
ba
bros
are
to
this
one
i
mean
an
a
personally
i
dont
see
it
there
are
so
many
better
stouts
out
there
very
drinkable
ill
take
this
over
pub
draught
any
day
and
i
might
even
take
this
over
fes
if
im
on
a
budget
and
not
looking
for
something
heavy
overall
i
would
purchase
this
only
at
a
bar
that
had
a
limited
selection
at
a
store
i
dont
think
its
worth
its
premium
import
price
for
a
sixpack
for
the
same
price
i
would
prefer
to
purchase
an
american
craft
beer
nonetheless
i
have
always
enjoyed
a
pint
of
this
at
bars
mainly
because
i
order
this
after
ive
had
a
few
for
this
review
i
made
this
my
first
beer
of
the
night
its
not
really
my
favorite
stout
but
it
is
acceptable
i
guess
beer
is
drinkable
retains
qualities
over
time
can
be
dranken
quickly
if
needed
the
souring
taints
this
beer
for
me
not
bad
but
not
great
drinkability
seeing
as
i
drank
well
over
12
in
a
short
amount
of
time
very
good
drinkability
drinkability
needs
more
malt
character
to
be
drinkable
the
burnt
character
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
but
at
least
it
makes
the
beer
interesting
drinks
quite
easily
much
better
than
regular
guinness
but
i
do
wish
they
would
make
this
in
a
nitro
bottle
its
worth
a
try
if
you
dont
have
a
big
selection
because
this
is
often
available
but
i
prolly
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
id
definatly
enjoy
it
if
offered
d
although
a
heavier
beer
calorie
and
carbwise
a
fantastic
beer
to
have
in
almost
every
situation
medium
abv
makes
it
easy
to
make
em
last
the
whole
game
drinkability
this
brew
is
easily
likable
easy
drinking
and
follows
the
qualities
of
a
proper
stout
always
solid
and
would
be
a
smart
choice
when
left
with
limited
options
are
there
better
stouts
sure
but
a
person
couldnt
go
wrong
by
selecting
this
one
in
my
opinion
d
this
is
one
of
my
old
standby
beers
a
regular
in
my
beer
rotation
very
drinkable
and
promises
good
times
in
a
nice
irish
pub
with
good
irish
music
i
want
more
very
drinkable
and
the
flavors
mentioned
dont
overpower
the
experience
perhaps
more
of
a
session
beer
than
some
sippers
probably
good
with
pizza
and
cigarettes
not
what
i
expected
from
its
reputation
as
a
popular
stout
though
d
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
stouts
way
better
than
the
more
popular
guinness
draught
version
which
pales
in
comparison
great
session
stout
especially
on
a
cold
night
when
you
need
a
dark
rich
beer
that
just
seems
to
warm
the
soul
drinkability
is
nice
but
the
overall
taste
of
this
brew
isnt
making
me
want
to
reach
for
another
its
ok
but
just
ok
the
flavor
is
deep
and
rich
with
smoky
undertones
no
beer
has
a
better
head
or
better
lacing
d
this
is
a
really
drinkable
brew
one
that
could
be
a
session
stout
i
find
the
flavors
to
be
too
low
key
and
i
do
think
that
i
would
search
for
another
to
get
dead
set
on
consuming
this
for
session
purposes
all
in
all
a
nice
and
balanced
brew
drinkability
this
beer
is
pretty
good
would
drink
it
again
not
the
best
stout
i
ever
had
but
pretty
good
verdict
sure
its
ubiquitous
at
this
point
but
whats
the
point
drink
it
if
youre
broke
as
it
always
does
the
trick
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
it
will
without
a
doubt
be
in
a
rotation
in
my
fridge
overall
a
disappointment
this
is
what
happens
when
you
contract
brew
your
beer
very
drinkable
not
as
smooth
and
creamy
as
draught
not
as
big
and
full
as
foreign
extra
but
overall
a
tasty
irish
dry
stout
unfortunately
cant
find
the
dublin
one
out
in
town
in
spain
so
i
settled
for
the
imported
one
from
canada
to
the
navy
base
still
a
nice
hearty
macrobrew
nonetheless
tried
two
waysstraigt
up
in
my
tasting
mug
a
nice
dark
brown
with
dark
brown
head
of
approx
1
inch
laced
nicely
s
malty
chocalately
goodness
tastesweet
malty
burnt
chocolate
m
heavy
d
like
a
sandwich
only
all
liquid
could
drink
a
few
but
would
feel
like
i
ate
a
loaf
of
bread
the
second
way
i
tried
was
in
a
black
and
tan
with
a
nice
belgian
strong
pale
alejudas
supercharged
black
and
tan
with
the
8
5
abv
as
a
treat
in
the
bottom
used
a
you
tube
video
to
coach
on
the
pour
if
you
like
a
strong
cocktail
then
i
recommend
pairing
this
with
a
strong
belgian
pale
ale
dont
try
with
a
strong
american
pale
ale
or
the
hops
will
kill
the
sensation
dgiven
the
crisp
dry
finish
this
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
i
would
give
it
a
5
but
on
second
thought
no
but
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
saw
this
beer
time
and
time
again
passing
it
by
but
one
cool
crisp
day
i
said
no
i
will
try
this
beer
and
i
did
and
im
glad
it
is
highly
drinkable
though
and
of
course
a
million
times
better
than
the
typical
american
macro
theres
enough
flavor
there
to
keep
one
happy
and
focused
on
the
conversation
but
its
mild
enough
to
stay
in
the
background
and
i
can
imagine
downing
quite
a
few
of
these
d
cant
drink
more
than
one
of
these
and
only
on
occasion
the
burnt
flavor
is
just
a
little
too
much
for
me
and
seems
a
bit
unbalanced
i
know
this
isnt
a
very
descriptive
writeup
i
usually
try
to
be
very
descriptive
and
accurate
but
guinness
extra
is
just
one
of
those
beers
that
kind
of
speaks
for
itself
leagues
better
than
draught
not
as
good
as
foreign
extra
stout
fantastic
beer
despite
its
commercialization
always
in
my
fridge
rjt
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
the
girl
poured
both
pints
properly
with
a
good
break
between
the
first
two
thirds
and
the
last
third
perhaps
a
tiny
bit
colder
than
recommended
but
a
wonderful
creamy
head
that
really
hit
the
spot
its
very
hard
to
beat
d
kind
of
glad
i
tried
this
seems
pretty
successionable
but
the
hops
or
malt
bite
at
the
end
is
still
pretty
aggressive
but
i
still
could
have
a
few
in
one
sitting
now
i
just
need
to
find
the
7
5
percent
version
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
stout
a
little
thicker
a
little
more
complexity
and
it
would
be
stellar
but
im
still
happy
with
the
buy
not
bad
for
my
first
guinness
and
long
overdue
d
always
drinkable
you
can
never
get
sick
of
this
stuff
im
almost
hoping
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
but
i
fear
this
is
just
as
good
as
it
gets
verdict
an
irish
favorite
and
one
of
mine
also
this
is
some
dark
beer
more
very
dark
caramel
than
any
amber
rates
a
38
on
the
srm
chart
what
a
head
caramel
brown
four
fingers
thick
lasts
for
better
than
five
minutes
before
starting
to
settle
to
a
mound
in
the
middle
and
thick
lacing
rich
heavy
smell
of
yeast
honey
oats
and
lots
of
malt
good
rich
taste
of
licorice
and
malt
with
a
wonderful
bitter
after
taste
of
hops
great
feeling
of
cream
as
it
rolls
over
my
tongue
with
a
medium
mild
tingling
feeling
oh
yes
this
is
a
good
brew
to
serve
with
good
food
especially
a
thick
steak
and
potatoes
my
first
stout
and
i
know
i
like
it
d
yes
now
this
one
is
bitter
almost
hoppy
like
an
ipa
just
a
beauty
when
poured
and
the
anticipation
of
greatness
was
there
the
taste
had
me
wanting
more
though
the
tastr
and
mouth
feel
were
about
as
expected
7
years
ago
i
thought
this
was
terrible
today
i
am
somewhat
impressed
their
quality
overall
is
impressive
guinness
drought
is
not
even
remotely
close
to
this
this
one
is
totally
different
smooth
and
very
flavorful
slightly
high
carbonation
that
offsets
a
full
almost
heavy
mouthfeel
quite
bitter
with
lots
of
black
coffee
and
baking
cocoa
nicely
complex
with
some
hints
of
toast
and
smoke
on
the
long
finish
easydrinking
despite
the
bitterness
and
a
good
sipper
this
beer
has
a
dark
colour
and
a
head
that
lasts
about
a
minute
but
never
quite
goes
away
it
has
a
sweet
malty
smell
the
taste
is
malty
at
first
but
just
gets
milky
and
mild
into
an
aftertaste
of
honey
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
mouth
its
reasonably
foamy
i
like
this
beer
so
much
more
than
regular
guinness
d
no
despicable
highly
unrecommended
even
at
its
peak
try
a
real
stout
a
classic
irish
stout
i
love
dark
coffee
so
i
love
this
beer
i
love
to
pair
this
with
a
good
meat
and
potatoes
meal
very
good
with
beef
i
will
continue
to
support
this
beer
and
will
have
this
again
guinness
extra
stout
certainly
does
not
bear
much
resemblance
to
its
cousin
draught
it
is
a
much
fuller
more
flavorful
and
tastier
the
beer
is
still
bone
dry
and
ink
black
but
without
the
cascading
curtains
of
nitrogen
bubbles
or
the
everlasting
head
the
beer
smells
toastier
like
freshly
opened
bag
of
pretzels
and
has
more
spice
and
roast
character
the
beer
definitely
isnt
as
creamy
but
has
a
nice
fine
carbonation
that
is
refreshing
notes
i
enjoy
this
more
than
the
regular
guinness
draught
i
first
tried
this
just
after
turning
21
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
in
for
the
first
sip
came
as
a
surprise
while
the
following
ones
were
about
trying
to
figure
this
one
out
i
have
enjoyed
it
many
times
through
the
years
and
will
as
long
as
they
keep
making
it
drinkability
is
fairly
good
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
couple
in
a
session
it
is
a
quite
rich
tasting
beer
but
its
still
the
best
damn
offering
youre
likely
to
find
at
a
random
gas
station
or
convenience
store
and
for
that
it
deserves
applause

a
great
creamy
mouthfeel
that
youd
come
to
expect
from
guinness
if
only
it
was
on
nitrogen
a
welcome
surprise
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
for
a
heavy
beer
i
do
like
it
the
taste
is
a
little
bland
and
bitter
for
me
though
the
beer
is
really
heavy
compared
to
most
which
i
do
like
but
the
taste
is
too
dark
for
my
liking
its
pours
almost
black
compared
to
most
beers
drinkability
easy
drinking
stout
not
too

not
too
little

black
pour
with

is
a
nice
subtly
roasty
smell
with
a
hint
of

and
some
caramel
as
it
opens
up
and
warms
and
becomes
cloying
smelling
and
artificial
after
a
bit
taste
is
nice
and
full
bodied
as
opposed
to
guinness
draught
which
is
pretty
thin
and
watery
much
fuller
taste
roasty
malts
a
touch
too
much
caramel
flavor
but
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
and
nice
but
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
keeps
it
from
being
too
heavy
finishes
with
a
medium
to
long
lengthed
slightly
bitter
roasted
malt
aftertaste
di
have
this
nostalgic
memory
of
this
beer
but
now
im
just
disappointed
its
like
when
undercover
brother
first
came
out
and
i
swore
it
was
the
funniest
movie
ever
then
bought
the
dvd
and
realized
it
was
really
not
very
good
i
dont
think
ill
ever
buy
this
again
a
bit
of
my
drinking
childhood
died
today
when
i
drank
this
rather
appealing
to
the
eye
on
the
pour
with
a
nice
firm
head
this
beers
saving
grace
really
nose
is
mildly
dirt
and
yeast
tobacco
and
coffee
bitter
and
mild
the
feel
was
consistent
but
not
particular
voluminous
seemed
like
nothing
but
a
subdued
version
of
theyre
export
softer
bitter
flatter
malt
palate
range
very
very
subtle
fruit
zing
overall
the
nectar
of
the
gods
would
be
better
in
ireland
where
it
isnt
pasteurized
also
good
content
of
beer
yeast
which
is
good
for
you
great
beer
personal
favorite
might
buy
it
again
especially
if
in
a
restaurant
and
the
menu
is
limited
poured
into
a
red
wine
glass
this
beer
had
a
nice
onefinger
foamy
light
coffee
colored
head
with
nice
retention
as
i
downed
this
pitch
black
baby
the
head
clung
to
the
sides
beautifully
as
guinness
does
smells
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
and
has
a
matching
taste
profile
thats
stronger
and
with
a
hoppy
dryness
to
it
the
beers
very
prickly
but
smooth
with
moderate
body
as
i
was
drinking
this
with
a
veal
scallopine
marsala
dish
i
was
only
able
to
drink
two
even
if
not
eating
its
a
very
filling
beer
drinkability
while
i
think
i
like
this
one
in
flavor
more
than
the
nitrobottle
version
draught
i
cant
see
myself
reaching
for
another
one
the
bitterness
and
roastedburned
flavors
are
too
strong
for
more
than
one
a
night
for
me
still
the
beer
is
good
just
not
wow
good

i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
much
less
tasty
and
thinner
than
the
regular
stout
at
first
smell
i
sensed
more
of
a
lager
or
beer
smell
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
stout
if
i
didnt
see
the
beer
id
have
assumed
it
to
be
a
lager
i
poured
it
into
a
sam
adams
glass
and
it
was
immediately
apparent
that
this
was
a
much
poorer
product
there
was
no
creaminess
or
full
flavor
or
even
full
body
that
i
enjoy
in
their
low
alcohol
regular
stout
the
flavor
was
bland
mere
hints
of
roastiness
or
maltiness
in
comparison
i
got
a
nice
big
bottle
of
it
and
finally
decided
to
pour
the
last
half
of
it
down
the
drain
i
could
stomach
it
no
more
especially
when
i
had
much
better
beer
in
the
fridge
ill
stick
to
the
imperial
stouts
from
now
on
my
first
real
stout
i
like
it
and
it
is
a
surprisingly
sessionable
brew
a
solid
drinkable
everyday
stout
d
very
high
i
absolutely
love
it
this
is
probably
my
favorite
to
drink
drinkability
4
out
of
5
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
is
decently
drinkable
one
could
have
a
few
since
the
calorie
count
is
under
200
and
the
abv
is
only

overall
a
very
good
dark
beer
had
this
on
draft
in
a
pub
in
county
claire
ireland
poured
well
with
a
inch
thick
white
head
that
lasted
the
beer
smell
was
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
oak
taste
was
the
same
roasted
malt
chocolate
with
a
woody
dry
finish
that
was
nice
and
smoothe
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
creamy
but
not
thick
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
nice
football
season
stout
i
specifically
signed
up
in

to
refute
a

that

guinness
in
a
can
sucks
i
feel
like
the
taste
from
the
can
ruins
this
brew
especially
when
served
at
the
proper
temperature
notes
the
extra
stout
is
very
true
it
literally
tastes
like
guinness
on
steroids
overall
very
enjoyable
not
impressive
at
all
d
a
classic
that
is
always
a
pleasure
to
get
from
time
to
time
i
can
not
remember
the
last
guinness
extra
stout
i
have
had
solid
pours
pitch
black
with
a
finger
of
eggshell
head
nose
is
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
taste
is
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
then
a
slight
bitterness
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
really
lacking
compared
to
tap
but
still
has
the
distinctive
tang
that
guinness
always
does
one
of
the
gateway
beers
into
craft
and
i
can
see
why
very
approachable
but
well
enough
manufactured
to
still
be
a
staple
product
this
beer
pours
a
vaguely
clear
dark
brown
almost
black
color
the
head
is
and
inch
in
height
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
graham
cracker
it
is
vibrant
but
simple
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
carbonation
that
seems
too
high
for
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
dry
stouts
out
there
bottom
line
i
remember
having
the
dublin
brewed
product
years
ago
and
it
was
a
better
stout
in
all
ways
but
this
one
aint
bad
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
brewed
in
canada
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
jet
black
with
a
massive
white
head
as
the
head
recedes
is
leaves
a
pleasant
white
cap
on
top
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
roasted
coffee
the
flavor
is
sweet
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
the
finish
is
crisp
it
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
very
quaffable
a
sentimental
favorite
of
mine
because
it
is
the
first
craft
beer
i
enjoyed
i
could
imagine
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
occation
definitely
better
than
the
draught
besides
for
the
appearance
mouthfeel
is
smooth
very
drinkable
if
you
are
cool
with
the
guinness
tang
d
not
a
beer
that
i
find
myself
going
after
too
often
but
once
in
a
while
it
hits
the
spot
overall
what
can
i
say
this
is
the
base
stout
the
ale
from
which
peoples
interest
in
craft
brews
are
started
this
is
the
first
departure
from
the
idea
that
beer
is
fizzy
yellow
and
pissflavored
mainly
because
it
doesnt
conform
to
most
bmclike
macros
even
though
this
is
pretty
much
a
macrobrew
poured
a
very
dark
brownish
black
with
a
dirty
white
head
nose
had
an
aroma
of
malt
smoke
and
chocolate
taste
was
extremely
dry
plenty
of
malt
and
chocolate
the
body
was
creamy
and
the
finish
was
chocolate
with
some
smoke
present
had
a
nice
pucker
factor
with
it
as
well
always
a
drinkable
beer
overall
this
stout
seemed
to
be
a
lot
thinner
than
the
ones
i
am
used
to
drinking
there
really
wasnt
anything
to
special
with
this
beer
but
i
think
it
could
make
a
good
session
stout
well
its
a
good
beer
and
certainly
better
than
their
draught
offering
but
im
not
sure
id
revisit
why
cant
we
get
the
st
martin
foreign
etc
stout
here
in
the
u
s
the
things
i
do
for
beer
advocate
i
cant
handle
a
whole
bunch
of
this
stuff
leaves
a
roastedbitter
aftertaste
that
i
dont
like
anyway
i
think
and
i
know
that
even
most
people
on
this
site
will
disagree
with
me
that
guinness
is
next
to
undrinkable
i
cant
stand
it
it
does
look
good
nice
creamy
pour
with
a
nice
creamy
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
just
so
skunky
to
me
though
sure
the
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
but
it
is
overdone
in
my
experience
if
the
beer
isnt
cold
enough
it
is
plain
flat
and
i
dont
like
my
stouts
that
cold
drinkability
is
low
as
i
can
barely
finish
a
bottle
drinkability
this
was
a
drain
pour
after
less
than
half
was
drank
its
not
even
good
for
getting
drunk
off
because
its
only
got
6
while
it
tastes
like
its
got
at
least
15
not
for
me
d
easy
to
drink
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
a
about
a
month
ago
at
a
party
i
had
no
problem
having
a
few
easy
to
drink
another
due
to
a
mild
abv
of
6
and
the
overall
smoothness
of
the
beer
and
the
distinctness
it
brings
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
14
inch
offwhite
head
good
lacing
with
decent
retention
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
easy
drinking
malthop
blended
stout
tastes
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
along
with
some
roasted
malts
good
blend
of
flavors
aftertaste
is
strongly
the
roasted
malts
crisp
not
so
smooth
but
low
carbonation
doesnt
interfere
overall
not
bad
at
all
and
easily
much
better
than
regular
guinness
well
its
decent
thats
for
sure
pours
a
nice
jet
black
with
a
light
brown
head
not
much
there
aroma
wise
took
many
whiffs
and
i
come
up
with
nothing
taste
is
a
bit
alcohol
heavy
for
only
6
abv
as
i
swirl
it
around
my
mouth
i
can
detect
some
strong
alcohol
burning
going
on
some
nice
malts
are
also
there
too
but
this
beers
alcohol
kick
affects
the
drinkability
a
good
deal
meh
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
finally
got
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
fairly
common
beer
that
ive
just
never
picked
up
really
liked
it
definitely
superior
to
the
omnipresent
but
fairly
nondescript
guinness
draught
this
one
looks
pitch
black
a
solid
tan
head
that
dissolves
fairly
slowly
nose
and
taste
are
strong
on
coffee
roasted
malt
some
light
fruit
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
in
there
feel
is
fairly
full
good
carbonation
appropriately
stouty
overall
a
nice
brew
this
beer
has
great
atmosphere
and
great
flavor
just
a
little
complexity
robust
bitter
and
truly
stout
has
a
light
drinkability
and
a
great
finish
excellent
quaff
if
youve
stuck
with
the
draught
you
havent
experienced
everything
guinness
has
to
offer
until
youve
gone
down
this
road
from
a
1
pt
6
fl
oz
bottle
marked
g10mb12042l8192nti
i
am
assuming
this
is
the
version
offered
widely
in
the
usa
the
one
you
can
find
just
about
anyplace
where
they
sell
beer
the
one
with
the
pythonesque
brilliant
ad
campaign
if
so
i
am
reviewing
the
right
one
despite
the
fact
that
everyone
and
his
brother
tries
this
at
least
once
i
am
giving
this
mainstream
brew
a
high
rating
because
it
is
one
of
the
best
easy
to
find
beers
you
can
buy
it
pours
brownblack
with
a
decent
foamy
tan
head
aroma
of
cocoa
malts

ends
dry
always
a
great
goto
beer
if
it
is
after
hours
not
especially
drinkable
but
its
not
cloying
either
drinkability
very
smooth
and
quite
tasty
i
could
easily
drink
2
mabye
even
3
in
one
sitting
drinkability
this
is
what
guinness
on
draft
should
be
not
that
nitro
abomination
d
very
high
it
doesnt
taste
really
strong
and
it
has
an
acceptable
taste
not
too
hard
on
the
stomach
too
my
introduction
to
extra
stouts
ive
become
very
fond
on
this
beer
as
theyre
readily
avaiable
in
socal
im
sure
ill
be
buying
more
in
the
future
nikki
conclusion
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
was
maybe
23
years
ago
when
i
bought
a
bomber
of
it
to
use
in
a
guinness
chocolate
cake
with
raspberry
coulis
wonderful
btw
nevermind
that
it
was
like
1030
a
m
i
polished
off
the
remainder
of
the
bomber
hey
you
cant
let
good
beer
go
to
waste
and
i
remember
really
liking
it
it
was
rich
malty
roasty
and
bold
in
a
word
the
opposite
of
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
got
an
off
bottle
its
possible
as
i
got
this
in
a
mixasix
or
if
this
is
what
guinness
has
become
since
its
brewed
in
canada
now
either
way
i
probably
wont
be
trying
this
again
any
time
soon
i
would
pair
this
with
any
red
meat
smothered
in
caramelized
onions
first
time
i
had
this
i
didnt
realize
there
was
a
difference
between
this
and
the
guinness
on
tap
oops
pours
dark
as
night
with
no
head
meatllic
but
nicely
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
aroma
taste
is
very
bitter
in
comparison
to
its
weaker
sibling
minimal
hops
but
lots
of
smoke
malt
and
bakers
chocolate
i
dont
know
which
i
prefer
drinkability
not
my
favorite
but
i
could
see
it
going
well
with
certain
foods
also
very
sessionable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
im
not
a
very
big
fan
of
the
original
guinness
but
i
really
liked
this
one
much
thicker
creamier
palate
than
standard
guinness
draft
tastes
fuller
as
well
again
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
but
this
one
was
pretty
damn
good
i
tried
this
beer
before
and
absolutely
hated
it
but
now
its
not
bad
just
pretty
okay
to
me
maybe
its
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
over
time
the
coffee
taste
and
thickness
of
the
beer
turns
me
away
which
as
i
said
i
guess
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
but
not
my
thing
d
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
the
draught
but
still
not
too
bad
i
could
easily
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
the
pour
is
very
deep
black
color
with
two
finger
dark
tan
head
the
aroma
of
coffee
chocolate
and
a
smokey
malt
hints
of
licorice
and
fruity
the
taste
has
a
strong
roasted
smokey
malt
backbone
hint
of
dusty
hops
the
finish
is
smooth
and
lasting
a
very
and
enjoyable
d
drinkable
beer
but
have
to
move
on
after
the
first
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
stout
one
is
just
never
enough
very
good
stuff
this
had
a
sharp
flavor
the
extra
stout
is
somehow
both
sweeter
and
more
bitter
than
guinness
draught
its
almost
like
a
sweettart
except
a
stout
this
beer
isnt
as
creamy
as
the
draught
since
theres
no
nitrogen
but
its
still
fairly
drinkable
my
wife
even
likes
it
better
and
shes
not
much
of
a
beer
drinker
i
have
only
had
a
few
irish
dry
stouts
and
i
am
beginning
to
think
its
just
not
a
style
that
i
can
enjoy
i
love
stouts
more
than
any
other
style
but
this
style
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
taste
this
is
a
big
malty
stout
as
well
as
having
toasted
and
burnt
flavors
there
is
also
some
chocolate
malts
smokey
flavor
as
well
d
after
having
a
handful
of
other
malty
stouts
this
one
lacks
what
it
takes
for
me
to
come
back
to
it
but
i
certainly
wont
turn
one
down
when
its
offered
d
because
of
the
leaning
toward
thinness
definitely
a
more
drinkable
stout
i
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
i
have
to
give
it
props
because
it
started
my
fascination
for
trying
other
beers
other
than
your
typical
mainsteam
lagers
this
poured
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
the
appearance
is
just
wonderful
had
a
nice
head
of
foam
and
lacing
that
sticks
around
has
strong
flavor
of
coffee
almost
burnt
flavored
bitter
aftertaste
that
mellows
i
wanted
to
love
this
but
just
could
not
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
one
i
could
drink
from
time
to
time
if
offered
to
me
but
i
will
not
buy
it
again
best

out

guinness
extra
stout
poured
a
dark
brown
appearing
almost
black
smell
was
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
smell
was
a
bit
on
the
light
side
taste
was
full
of
dark
roasted
flavors
roasted
malt
coffee
and
hints
of
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
good
this
beer
showed
surprising
drinkability
this
was
a
very
good
stout
showed
the
classic
guinness
profile
but
amped
up
a
bit
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
bottomless
abyss
of
black
liquid
fills
my
glass
brownish
foamy
head
that
cascades
down
the
side
of
the
glass
after
each
sip
a
very
attractive
effect
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
chocolate
milk
deep
robust
flavor
in
this
full
bodied
brew
a
subtle
sweetness
that
floats
around
the
palate
under
the
creamy
exterior
a
hop
bitter
freshness
as
the
aftertaste
makes
for
a
smooth
duality
of
flavors
good
drinkability
overall
its
not
too
heavy
for
multiple
rounds
but
creamy
enough
to
sit
well
on
the
stomach
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
one
at
a
time
d
this
has
great
flavor
and
a
nice
light
body
something
that
i
enjoy
drinking
alone
or
with
food
overall
a
solid
stout
one
i
reach
for
when
i
dont
want
an
imperial
stout
tastes
really
good
with
new
england
oysters
the
only
real
let
down
for
me
was
reading
the
label
and
finding
out
it
was
brewed
and
imported
from
canada
nothing
against
canadians
but
i
was
wanting
to
enjoy
a
classic
irish
beer
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
based
on
all
of
the
visual
and
olfactory
evidence
youd
think
this
would
be
hard
to
get
down
in
volume
but
you
be
wrong
sipable
or
a
downer
worth
a
try
drinkability
the
light
body
might
lend
itself
to
drinkability
but
the
bitterness
might
be
off
putting
for
some
black
mahogany
with
a
cafe
head
continuous
lacing
and
retention
faint
roasted
aroma
with
coffee
and
light
hops
the
taste
is
roasted
malt
and
astringent
hops
and
is
followed
by
an
intensely
dry
and
bitter
finish
guinness
extra
stout
is
a
classic
that
ill
always
return
to
but
it
just
doesnt
stack
up
to
much
next
to
all
these
micros
every
time
i
have
one
i
feel
like
im
back
on
vacation
in
ireland
d
flavorful
and
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
would
think
this
beer
was
a
scotch
wee
heavy
but
i
definitely
like
it
a
lot
more
than
the
regular
guinness
its
nice
heavier
thats
worth
drinking
for
a
while
d
i
like
to
have
one
of
these
once
in
a
while
at
home
in
the
uk
old
and
pregnant
ladies
still
drink
this
for
health
reasons
between
having
this
oldschool
wholesome
association
and
growing
up
drinking
great
guinness
ontap
i
have
to
say
i
am
biased
having
said
that
i
cant
drink
many
of
these
the
bitterness
of
it
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
good
carbonation
and
with
a
nice
rich
body
thats
not
too
thick
easily
drinkable
perhaps
it
had
gone
bad
there
was
a
definite
dustiness
i
bought
it
recently
at
a
store
i
always
have
good
experiences
with
there
was
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
so
i
couldnt
tell
i
may
need
to
give
this
one
another
try
some
day
light
on
booziness
and
in
body
with
fine
carbonation
guinness
extra
stout
is
ubiquitous
in
the
marketplace
inoffensive
and
an
extremely
easy
drinker
those
qualities
make
the
brew
in
my
mind
anyway
the
quintessential
gateway
beer
for
american
drinkers
looking
for
something
deeper
and
more
flavorful
than
the
standard
fare
of
bmc
ive
enjoyed
many
a
pint
nitrocan
and
bottle
o
the
black
ive
learned
to
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
a
good
tasting
im
going
to
bring
a
bottle
and
attempt
a
side
by
side
taste
test

go

but
if
it
says
guinness
it
must
be
good
had
to
do
a
classic
pours
out
of
the
tap
as
black
as
can
be
and
takes
several
minutes
to
settle
just
as
it
should
and
it
is
always
so
gratifying
watching
those
tiny
bubbles
rise
to
form
the
two
finger
tan
head
smells
of
malt
with
a
hoppyfloral
undertone
the
flavors
are
rather
simple
in
a
way
guinness
tastes
like
guinness
malt
some
maple
and
coffee
undertones
bitter
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
hoppy
finish
as
clean
and
as
smooth
as
beer
can
be
made
refreshing
hearty
and
filling
a
classic
for
a
reason
its
just
an
alright
beer
for
me
nothing
special
at
all
its
warmed
up
a
bit
and
still
nothing
special
i
could
drink
more
of
them
but
i
wont
bigger
and
better
things
await
a
great
dark
beer
when
i
was
younger
we
would
go
to
canada
to
drink
at
19
and
we
would
take
this
as
our
first
beer
at
the
casino
free
parking
and
the
drinks
were
a
little
cheaper
than
patrick
oryans
which
is
a
great
irish
pub
too
bad
its
in
canada
anyways
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
you
have
to
atleast
try
one
this
is
probably
most
peoples
first
dark
beer
and
a
good
choice
at
that
d
highly
drinkable
i
could
drink
several
despite
the
high
abv
d
this
is
a
very
sessionable
stout
its
smooth
and
very
wellbalanced
and
personally
i
would
never
turn
it
down
i
like
the
extra
over
the
regular
there
is
a
much
stronger
flavor
which
i
enjoy
in
a
hearty
stout
aroma
is
good
slightly
malty
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
pours
great
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
and
creamy
with
a
nice
head
not
as
good
as
the
draught
can
or
from
the
tap
since
there
is
no
cascade
effect
mouthfeel
has
more
fullness
than
the
regular
also
which
is
nice
flavor
is
heavy
with
dark
roasted
malts
sweet
and
also
bitter
very
drinkable
and
always
enjoyable
dbeing
that
it
is
such
a
mild
stout
i
could
easily
foresee
having
several
of
these
in
a
setting
nowhere
near
as
flavorful
as
some
of
the
other
stouts
on
my
list
d
goes
down
pretty
easily
i
bet
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
before
getting
sick
of
this
but
thats
where
it
would
stop
serving
bottle
into
english
pint
glass
mfd
smooth
and
enjoyable
not
as
good
as
the
stuff
i
grew
up
on
but
i
guess
it
will
have
to
do
for
now
not
as
dark
tasting
or
feeling
as
it
looks
i
think
a
lot
of
complexity
may
have
been
lost
with
this
beer
through
years
of
over
production
i
think
this
beer
is
worth
getting
maybe
once
a
year
if
its
on
sale
i
definitely
wouldnt
pay
full
price
great
beer
dark
dark
brown
color
almost
opaque
big
healthy
fluffy
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
wonderful
aroma
sweet
and
malty
sweet
malty
flavor
with
strong
hint
of
coffee
at
first
while
the
finish
is
more
bitter
and
slightly
astringent
not
unpleasant
but
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
love
the
mouthfeel
both
full
and
exciting
with
perfect
depth
and
carbonation
to
keep
it
both
solid
and
exciting
very
drinkable
very
nonchugable
but
very
very
drinkable
guiness
may
get
thumbs
down
from
extreme
snobs
but
this
stuff
is
good
beer
a
great
beer
hands
down
my
favorite
guiness
so
far
much
better
than
the
nitro
crap
that
is
everywhere
mouthfeel
is
super
bitter
deliciously
foamy
overall
not
superbly
drinkable
due
to
the
astringency
of
it
notes
it
was
not
badit
was
not
great
and
it
will
not
be
either
in
my
fridge
as
i
surely
expected
more
and
got
less
a
journey
man
beer
and
one
well
past
its
prime
drinkability
is
crucial
as
this
stuff
is
thick
its
very
satisfying
its
worth
the
extra
buck
to
throw
in
when
receiving
a
quality
product
on
tap
down
the
hatch
and
enjoy
yourself
its
guinness
need
i
say
more
notes
its
much
fuller
in
flavor
and
body
than
its
nitro
injected
cousin
guinness
draft
from
the
bottle
for
the
first
time
since
i
first
tried
it
here
in
the
us
back
in
the
70s
before
it
was
so
readily
available
on
tap
this
poured
a
black
brown
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
fair
lacing
nothing
in
appearance
like
its
draught
cousin
or
those
nitro
laced
cans
the
smell
even
seems
different
subtle
coffee
beans
and
maybe
a
bit
of
charcoal
i
get
some
of
the
same
effect
from
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
pumpernickel
bread
much
more
like
a
standard
lager
in
feel
well
carbonated
easy
drinking
but
not
as
smooth
and
velvetty
as
the
mothers
milk
you
get
on
draught
when
properly
poured
i
actually
enjoyed
it
very
much
more
drinkable
perhaps
than
the
tap
variety
but
not
as
sensational
not
very
bitter
a
little
dry
a
nice
option
to
have
guinness
at
those
summer
picnics
overall
it
is
a
nice
beer
but
not
as
smooth
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
the
bitterness
is
a
little
strong
and
stays
on
the
tongue
a
while
taste
well
what
can
i
say
other
than
brilliant
this
should
be
guinnesss
claim
to
fame
rather
than
its
draught
counterpart
overall
in
my
opinion
a
good
stout
that
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
its
excellent
reputation
it
does
everything
well
but
doesnt
excel
due
to
its
simple
flavor
profile
very
drinkable
not
too
heavy
to
have
more
than
one
in
the
dead
of
summer
still
a
very
nice
stout
nails
the
dry
stout
style
guinness
is
a
meal
in
itself
so
it
takes
an
empty
stomach
to
drink
a
few
a
delicious
beer
that
defines
the
irish
dry
stout
it
takes
some
time
to
grow
a
taste
for
but
once
it
is
there
youll
wonder
why
you
didnt
like
it
in
the
first
place
it
is
always
in
my
fridge
d
a
bit
of
a
let
down
when
compared
to
the
draught
less
sweet
more
dry
please
i
doubt
ill
revisit
this
one
unless
they
start
selling
them
for
5
a
case
this
is
better
than
the
draught
but
still
quite
poor
compared
to
the
euro
version
the
extra
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
nice
beige
head
roasted
and
burnt
malts
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavor
has
more
coffee
burnt
wheat
malts
and
bitter
chocolate
the
body
is
medium
and
has
a
dry
finish
a
drinkable
stout
mouthfeel
is
relatively
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
goes
down
really
easily
and
i
find
myself
wanting
another
d
very
refreshing
and
still
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
not
bad
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
sunshine
wheat
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
just
a
slight
bit
of
carbonation
and
leaves
tan
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
with
what
seems
like
just
a
slight
bit
of
grass
the
taste
is
an
amped
up
version
of
a
good
dry
stout
heavy
coffee
tastes
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
cream
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
not
artificial
like
you
get
with
those
stupid
widgets
in
the
nitro
cans
and
bottles
guinness
sets
the
standard
for
drinkability
in
my
book
d
boring
taste
hurts
drinkability
its
also
a
little
bit
fillingdefinitely
not
a
session
beer
but
what
stout
is
i
could
drink
this
if
better
options
werent
available
but
ive
had
plenty
of
other
wonderful
nonrisimperial
double
stouts
that
would
easily
take
the
place
of
this
d
one
would
be
enough
for
me
personally
dry
stouts
are
not
my
favorite
and
guinness
on
tap
is
a
much
better
option
in
my
opinion
however
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
only
because
i
felt
like
i
had
just
eaten
a
meal
after
i
was
done
if
i
werent
so
full
i
would
have
gone
back
and
had
another
my
only
wish
is
that
thought
of
taking
the
119
5
seconds
to
pour
as
guinness
recommends
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
generally
overrated
feels
creamy
and
foamy
thick
as
chocolate
milk
a
unique
smoky
creamy
porter
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
as
some
claim
but
a
darn
good
one
poured
from
a
nitro
can
into
a
glass
and
charged
this
brew
has
the
wonderful
cascade
head
that
settles
thick
and
creamy
the
smell
was
of
roasted
almost
burnt
malts
there
were
some
hints
of
woodiness
and
coffee
the
taste
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
i
know
guinness
has
been
around
a
long
time
but
i
have
had
so
much
better
for
my
money
solid
stout
but
nothing
special
an
impressive
looking
beverage
while
not
my
favorite
stout
it
is
a
pleasant
and
enjoyable
beverage
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
which
remained
consistent
til
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
the
feel
on
the
tongue
was
smooth
and
it
made
for
a
quite
drinkable
beverage
this
stout
pours
a
thick
heavy
dark
brown
thick
head
looks
like
a
frothy
milkshake
aroma
is
mainly
coffe
and
chocolate
taste
is
the
same
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
slight
alcohol
finish
enjoyable
from
the
first
to
last
drink
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
you
cannot
drink
many
at
one
sitting
but
i
will
do
my
best
good
job
overall
this
has
an
amazing
mouthfeel
i
loved
the
full
bodied
aspect
of
it
but
overall
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
seem
a
little
muted
d
better
then
expected
enjoyable
and
worthy
of
multiples
pours
extremely
dark
with
a
light
brown
head
flavor
carries
a
bit
of
a
bitter
edge
its
smooth
though
and
carries
a
nice
malty
body
no
real
wacky
character
feel
has
a
full
carbonation
and
a
standard
liquid
feel
decent
to
drink
but
with
so
much
else
out
there
i
am
not
overly
thrilled
the
aroma
is
a
nutty
malty
smell
that
is
faint
but
is
apparent
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
the
taste
is
fully
carbonated
and
again
nutty
and
mildly
malted
you
really
have
to
take
in
consideration
the
style
of
this
beer
to
be
objectionable
after
becoming
a
beer
snob
because
it
does
not
compare
to
american
stouts
or
imperial
stouts
it
is
in
a
class
by
itself
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
and
again
an
easy
drinker
good
stuff
drinkability
is
no
problem
with
this
brew
d
great
representation
of
the
style
very
refreshing
and
still
complex
enough
to
be
somewhat
of
a
sipper
this
beer
pours
a
nice
black
with
a
thick
and
tall
tan
colored
head
that
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malts
and
some
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
pretty
good
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
more
like
guinness
draught
but
i
like
this
one
better
much
better
it
has
a
roasted
malt
backbone
layered
over
some
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
some
very
faint
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
it
had
a
thick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
which
made
it
very
drinkable
but
slower
than
most
definately
better
than
draught
bought
myself
a
pint
size
bottle
to
celebrate
st
pattys
day
poured
it
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
the
color
was
midnight
black
cant
get
any
darker
the
smell
was
a
weird
combo
of
roasted
coffee
and
a
wet
rag
pungent
both
good
and
bad
taste
was
harshy
bitter
but
thats
what
makes
this
beer
unique
very
heavy
body
and
thick
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
a
sipper
not
to
be
consumed
quickly
an
old
favorite
by
guinness
that
will
remain
one
of
the
brewerys
classics
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
at
a
ball
game
but
definitely
one
i
savor
slowly
on
a
cold
winters
night
and
surely
not
one
i
would
ever
recommend
to
my
bud
loving
friends
guinness
is
a
must
for
stoutlovers
highly
recommend
even
great
out
of
an
80oz
glass
boot
whoo
drinkability
dark
and
rich
heavy
yet
highly
enjoyable
this
is
what
a
stout
should
be
overall
its
an
okay
brew
overall
hey
its
st
patricks
day
and
you
have
to
drink
guinness
this
one
qualifies
and
actually
has
some
taste
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
brew
o
a
step
up
in
depth
from
the
original
and
worth
the
occasional
purchase
d
guinness
with
balls
much
more
intense
than
its
widgeted
brother
an
above
average
stout
very
dry
and
enjoyable
appears
black
until
its
held
to
light
then
i
can
see
its
very
dark
brown
smells
like
well
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
smoke
tastes
great
pleasant
bitterness
of
a
hop
bite
with
a
roasted
malt
almost
smokey
flavor
subtle
hints
of
possibley
coffee
or
dark
chocolate
or
something
smooth
beer
very
good
st
patricks
day
is
in
six
days
and
i
got
my
irish
flat
cap
and
ill
be
ready
to
crush
many
of
these
d
great
every
now
and
then
d
easily
drinkable
kind
of
one
dimensional
but
full
flavored
and
satisfying
definitely
preferable
to
the
bottled
or
canned
draught
pours
black
with
a
medium
dense
tan
head
lacing
on
sides
of
surface
nice
roasted
malty
aroma
dark
roasted
malt
dominates
the
flavor
muted
sweetness
in
the
background
light
bitterness
from
the
malt
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
provides
balance
finishes
dry
medium
to
full
bodied
pretty
drinkable
overall
a
classic
and
tasty
stout
overall
quite
simply
a
very
good
stout
ill
have
to
try
australian
brewed
guinness
draught
after
this
to
see
if
it
is
as
crap
as
i
remember
it
being
pours
a
dark
brown
can
i
say
light
blacknut
brown
a
head
shows
up
for
a
few
minutes
and
goes
away
pretty
quickly
smell
is
nutty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
tastes
like
nuts
a
little
hint
of
coffee
and
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
watery
for
me
for
a
stout
but
not
too
bad
a
very
drinkable
stout
much
better
than
that
crap
that
most
people
in
america
think
is
real
guinness
attempted
to
have
one
of
these
was
much
too
bitter
for
me
and
left
me
with
a
bad
aftertaste
if
you
dont
like
a
bitter
strong
taste
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
i
really
didnt
care
for
it
its
really
not
a
bad
beer
its
interesting
to
see
how
your
taste
changes
over
the
years
i
prefer
this
to
all
other
versions
of
guinness
in
bottles
or
cans
i
have
tried
in
usa
although
handpulled
is
still
the
way
to
go
ive
been
enjoying
going
back
to
the
basics
after
so
many
chocolatecoffeecakeymega
malt
forward
microbrew
stouts
guinness
regular
tastes
thin
and
mildly
distracting
bitter
but
the
g
extra
stout
marks
a
perfect
balance
and
so
makes
for
a
perfect
stout
who
knows
if
my
palate
will
return
to
appreciating
the
humble
guinness
regular
dark
with
nice
chestnutambered
glints
if
held
up
to
light
head
decent
though
less
thick
and
creamy
than
guinness
regular
mouthfeel
smooth
and
substantial
taste
wherefore
the
charmhint
of
toastiness
hint
of
sweetness
the
spectre
of
creaminess
chased
by
cool
bitters
truly
delightfula
beer
to
nurse
over
easy
convo
when
i
am
craving
to
take
a
dip
into
nutella
or
chomp
truffle
chocolates
ill
go
back
to
the
microbrew
stouts
this
is
the
stout
of
all
stouts
not
too
harsh
not
to
mild
just
right
started
drinking
it
when
in
sweden
for
school
my
irish
classmates
convinced
me
to
try
it
after
3
days
i
was
hooked
now
i
can
not
go
to
any
bar
with
out
ordering
it
now
i
go
to
all
the
guinness
nights
at
our
local
bars
yes
i
am
addicated
and
loving
it
d
a
nicely
balanced
beer
with
complex
flavors
not
overpowering
but
rich
and
damn
tasty
in
the
glass
the
beer
is
totally
black
with
a
hint
of
dark
red
highlights
through
the
pour
a
moderately
cream
and
tan
head
covers
the
liquid
the
head
is
tall
firm
and
quite
rocky
its
an
attractive
stout
the
aroma
is
all
about
the
roast
roasted
barley
charcoal
a
bit
of
dark
bitter
chocolate
and
dark
roast
coffee
dry
and
bitter
its
not
a
smooth
beer
but
instead
has
a
welcome
roughness
bitterness
from
the
burnt
and
roastedness
begins
early
and
lasts
into
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
almost
no
malt
quality
and
no
real
sweetness
this
one
is
surely
dry
full
in
body
and
distinct
in
character
its
not
complex
not
at
all
but
its
straightforward
and
solidly
good
for
a
dry
stout
the
finish
is
clean
and
sharp
making
it
very
refreshing
unlike
a
lot
of
my
starter
beers
this
one
holds
up
well
to
its
memory
i
strongly
prefer
it
over
the
draught
stout
and
its
definitely
worth
having
every
once
in
a
while
this
is
my
goto
beer
in
a
club
when
available
in
bottle
vs
draught
form
d
i
liked
the
way
this
beer
started
with
a
nice
appearance
flavorfull
smell
and
even
taste
at
first
but
by
the
end
it
seemed
overly
bitter
and
hard
to
enjoy
could
be
me
ill
probably
want
to
give
it
another
try
in
the
future
though
d
this
is
much
better
than
the
draught
version
this
is
a
good
enjoyable
sipper
the
texture
is
good
wellbalanced
creamy
smooth
with
tinges
of
bitterness
near
the
finish
a
solid
stout
fairly
standard
but
without
offputting
characteristics
to
detract
from
it
worth
revisiting
would
highly
recommend
genuinely
good
irish
stout
this
is
just
a
damn
good
beer
period
i
had
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
to
start
my
super
bowl
watching
and
was
amazed
because
i
am
so
used
to
regular
guinness
which
is
way
overhyped
due
to
those
incessant
ads
poured
this
in
my
mug
and
there
was
a
thick
black
liquid
that
proceeded
with
a
frothy
head
that
never
went
away
nice
smell
nothing
overpowering
but
it
was
a
light
coffee
malt
smell
mixed
with
nuts
the
flavor
is
more
pronouced
as
the
body
is
heavy
with
coffee
malt
roasted
malt
and
maybe
some
chocolate
balanced
nicely
with
some
smoothness
attributed
to
caramel
malt
as
the
hops
are
pronounced
and
it
ends
dry
overall
a
standout
stout
that
once
could
session
a
very
nice
irish
stout
big
boy
guinness
much
more
flavorful
than
its
little
brother
black
pour
with
lasting
thick
foamy
light
tan
head
smell
is
a
nice
subtly
roasty
smell
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
some
caramel
as
it
opens
up
and
warms
and
becomes
cloying
smelling
and
artificial
after
a
bit
taste
is
nice
and
full
bodied
as
opposed
to
guinness
draught
which
is
pretty
thin
and
watery
much
fuller
taste
roasty
malts
a
touch
too
much
caramel
flavor
but
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
this
is
so
much
better
than
regular
guinness
i
think
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
and
nice
but
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
keeps
it
from
being
too
heavy
finishes
with
a
medium
to
long
lengthed
slightly
bitter
roasted
malt
aftertaste
a
solid
stout
for
sure
drinkability
a
couple
of
these
on
a
warm
night
is
always
nice
as
they
go
down
smooth
its
by
far
the
best
stout
but
for
a
locally
available
brew
its
not
to
shabby
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
not
fantastic
its
doesnt
have
an
interesting
bitterness
and
is
kind
of
boring
compared
to
other
irish
stouts
i
do
like
the
dryness
of
the
beer
and
it
does
get
easier
to
drink
as
it
warms
but
its
not
that
impressive
you
are
better
off
finding
a
nitrogen
version
or
going
to
local
pub
that
serves
a
great
guinness
pour
black
in
the
glass
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
a
light
nice
thick
billowy
tan
head
to
start
that
falls
to
a
thin
film
and
throws
a
bunch
of
lace
sure
it
isnt
the
nitro
stout
but
it
looks
good
the
smell
is
roasty
burnt
grain
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
with
some
esters
the
taste
starts
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
a
touch
of
molasses
the
sweetness
moves
aside
as
hop
and
burnt
malt
bitterness
move
quickly
to
the
forefront
the
finish
is
dry
and
really
quite
bitter
almost
puckering
overall
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
and
smooth
great
session
beer
much
better
than
the
nitro
version
which
tastes
really
watered
down
when
compared
to
the
great
coffee
chocolate
and
bitter
flavors
that
the
original
has
glad
i
decided
to
give
this
a
go
very
accessible
beer
that
tastes
great
is
sessionable
and
wont
wear
the
wallet
out
whats
not
to
love
its
a
good
change
of
pace
from
normal
guinness
in
summary
the
beer
isnt
suited
for
a
careful
tasting
and
it
wont
hold
up
to
a
chimay
or
any
craft
brew
or
fine
import
but
its
a
good
beer
for
great
times
its
easy
to
find
it
wont
break
the
bank
and
its
worthy
of
respect
this
was
brewed
in
toronto
canada
not
dublin
ireland
as
the
front
label
would
suggest
poured
from
a
doubleduce
bomber
to
a
pint
glass
beer
is
almost
black
with
a
faint
dark
brown
hue
around
the
edge
and
a
nice
twofinger
foamycreamy
brown
head
the
nose
is
sweeter
than
i
remember
im
only
getting
slight
roasted
notes
which
is
what
i
usually
expect
from
guinness
i
think
i
served
myself
too
cold
which
is
preventing
the
normal
characteristics
from
showing
themselves
the
taste
has
the
same
sweet
fruitiness
upfront
but
is
quickly
quelled
by
the
bitterness
you
might
expect
from
burnt
coffee
there
is
also
a
slight
oxidation
present
which
doesnt
do
much
for
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
expansive
carbonation
and
finishes
dry
duh
overall
a
drinkable
beer
easily
sessionable
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
and
ive
known
some
people
to
get
sick
off
of
it
probably
mixingconsumptiontheyre
lame
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
ill
stick
to
regular
guinness
stout
i
dont
think
anyones
marketing
comes
close
to
guinness
theyve
developed
an
entire
culture
around
this
beer
that
makes
saying
anything
bad
about
it
close
to
heresy
even
seasoned
beer
geeks
get
dewy
eyed
when
they
talk
about
a
pint
of
the
plain
the
infatuation
with
guinness
is
pretty
much
over
for
me
this
is
tasteless
compared
to
so
many
other
porters
but
if
you
want
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
or
want
to
set
a
baseline
this
is
it
slainte
as
for
the
characteristics
its
the
benchmark
for
stouts
it
is
what
it
is
without
the
nitro
the
head
swells
up
nicely
at
first
then
dies
down
with
some
lacing
all
the
expected
notes
and
flavors
are
there
but
they
are
very
well
mixed
and
not
much
stands
out
a
deep
whiff
reveals
some
delightful
tar
roasted
nuts
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
balanced
and
not
sweet
with
a
mildly
bitter
and
long
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
its
drinkability
is
remarkable
then
again
i
dont
purchase
this
all
the
time
so
maybe
thats
why
it
doesnt
get
old
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
good
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
very
nice
scent
coffee
and
burnt
grains
a
nice
malty
feel
great
taste
a
buffed
up
guinness
nice
coffee
flavor
a
little
butterscotch
it
goes
down
great
very
smooth
if
a
little
thick
its
on
my
list
of
easily
found
and
easily
drinkable
d
drinkable
a
good
passable
standard
dry
stout
d
overall
a
farely
drinkable
beer
nice
taste
and
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
formidable
stout
all
in
all
a
pretty
ok
beer
nice
coco
head
that
makes
up
about
half
of
the
glass
with
nice
sustain
just
as
dark
probably
darker
than
the
other
guinness
types
without
the
internal
beer
show
overall
this
would
be
a
good
beer
i
think
to
have
at
a
pub
if
youve
tried
everything
else
and
like
stout
a
good
allround
beer
this
is
the
prepackaged
guinness
to
go
for
a
good
reliable
beer
that
you
can
depend
on
to
come
through
when
you
want
a
nice
roasted
malt
stout
without
getting
into
the
imperials
d
six
of
these
and
some
nice
irish
folk
music
in
doolin
and
youve
had
one
heck
of
a
night
a
dark
chocolate
in
appearance
with
a
light
brown
healthy
head
smell
of
molasses
and
sweet
dark
malt
taste
is
lightly
sweet
burnt
molasses
with
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
easy
to
drink
leaving
a
bitter
burnt
aftertaste
easily
drinkable
and
much
better
than
the
draught
lightly
roasted
malty
sweet
smell
taste
is
also
lightly
roasted
malt
with
faint
coffee
notes
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
full
bodied
and
finishes
easily
i
like
this
one
alot
its
much
better
than
the
draught
ive
had
on
tapnitrocannitro
bottle
in
the
past
short
of
actually
going
to
dublin
id
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
guinness
than
this
first
in
a
series
of
beers
ive
had
before
but
didnt
review
extra
stout
is
guinness
draughts
big
brother
similar
in
flavor
but
heavier
which
i
think
is
a
good
thing
id
like
to
try
this
on
nitro
sometime
for
a
sidebyside
comparison
d
pretty
drinkable
though
tea
flavors
made
brew
feel
bland
at
times
solid
brew
not
a
bad
call
but
they
are
better
ones
very
different
than
the
nitro
draught
variety
that
ive
been
used
to
for
years
i
appreciate
a
more
traditional
taste
and
its
easy
to
see
where
guinness
began
a
musttry
for
beer
drinkers
notes
great
classic
beer
not
a
bad
option
especially
if
on
a
tight
budget
or
if
ba
lives
in
rural
sc
winks
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
sip
and
not
swill
as
im
sure
everyone
is
guinness
is
a
winner
and
actually
relatively
easy
to
find
in
the
us
ps
my
carbomb
days
are
mostly
behind
me
but
as
an
enthusiast
of
mixed
drinks
involving
beer
i
have
to
recommend
that
everyone
try
at
least
one
what
are
you
waiting
for
the
original
stout
i
remember
sneaking
drinks
of
my
dads
guinness
when
i
was
12
pours
an
absolute
black
my
desk
lamp
wont
penatrate
it
at
all
big
tan
creamy
head
w
lots
of
lacing
a
malty
faint
burnt
aroma
w
some
yeasty
undertones
a
good
crisp
bitter
initial
flavor
then
tapering
off
to
more
complex
malt
undertones
very
dry
lightmed
body
contrary
to
everyone
thinking
of
it
as
thick
with
plenty
of
dextrins
co2
a
very
drinkable
addictive
beer
this
is
the
one
that
started
it
all
for
me
up
until
i
tried
guinnessi
had
just
had
american
beerlike
old
stylebudmiller
etc
and
i
never
knew
what
i
was
missing
after
this
i
tried
to
find
as
many
new
beers
as
i
could
no
longer
my
favoritebut
it
still
has
a
place
in
my
heart
the
taste
was
much
like
the
smell
and
i
found
myself
sipping
it
much
like
i
would
a
cup
of
coffee
or
coco
very
rich
with
flavor
and
kind
of
heavy
but
i
liked
it
so
well
i
have
bought
it
several
times
im
on
a
quest
now
to
try
many
other
types
of
dark
stouts
drinkability
although
not
as
smooth
as
a
nitrocan
it
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
moreso
than
the
traditional
guinnessat
least
the
now
standard
guinness
much
better
than
i
remember
it
to
be
stiff
and
bitter
but
with
much
more
to
offer
flavor
wise
than
just
char
and
bitterness
i
have
had
a
long
history
with
this
beer
and
only
recently
realized
i
had
never
bothered
to
review
it
mainly
we
used
this
in
new
mexico
and
texas
because
the
bitterness
could
cut
through
the
pain
and
heat
of
very
hot
foods
but
there
is
an
actual
good
beer
here
too
p
s
now
ive
gotta
try
a
car
bomb
with
the
extra
stout
this
is
my
goto
macro
stout
because
its
cheap
by
the
22
oz
bottle
and
delivers
the
roasted
malt
that
some
of
us
crave
time
to
time
still
a
good
beer
not
as
much
hype
as
the
draught
but
not
the
best
stout
i
would
still
never
turn
down
a
guinness
drinkability
very
good
and
very
tasty
not
as
smooth
and
drinkable
as
guinness
draught
but
more
flavorful
and
bold
taste
nice
flavor
but
not
overpowering
or
overly
complex
coffee
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
bittering
hop
to
balance
out
sweet
and
dry
finish
of
toasted
malt
and
some
sort
of
fruitiness
that
i
cant
identify
the
only
disappointing
part
is
the
mouthfeel
which
was
more
thin
than
i
would
have
liked
this
is
one
is
perfect
for
sitting
back
with
some
friends
and
knocking
a
few
out
over
some
good
conversation
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
stouts
congrats
d
nutritious
and
hearty
with
a
nice
easy
flavor
this
might
weigh
me
down
but
it
sure
is
gooood
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
fantastic
tan
head
with
plenty
of
chunky
lacing
doesnt
have
the
cascading
effect
but
still
a
5
the
smell
is
nonexistant
all
i
pick
up
is
a
very
light
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
of
bitter
chocolate
light
roasted
coffee
charred
beef
i
would
say
charcoal
over
charred
beef
but
i
never
actually
tasted
charcoal
before
and
im
not
about
to
start
well
bodied
and
well
carbonated
finishes
quite
crisp
and
slightly
bitter
quite
drinkable
and
much
better
than
the
draught
shite
great
choice
enjoy
d
dinner
no
thanks
just
had
one
seriously
though
id
be
hard
pressed
to
drink
more
than
two
in
a
night
owing
to
the
thickness
of
this
fine
stout
this
is
a
good
guinness
recently
tried
the
draught
for
the
first
time
and
wasnt
too
impressed
so
it
inspired
me
to
try
this
much
better
pours
black
perhaps
the
first
beer
ive
had
that
actually
pours
black
even
when
held
to
the
light
nice
tan
head
that
stays
around
through
the
duration
and
leaves
nice
lace
behind
smell
is
of
ice
coffee
and
malt
and
some
caramel
tastes
like
some
malt
grain
and
chocolate
all
mixed
together
a
great
balance
of
sweetnees
and
some
bitterness
as
well
from
the
hops
leaves
an
almost
dry
chocolatey
aftertaste
higher
carbonation
than
the
draught
makes
the
mouthfeel
different
and
better
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
all
4s
as
this
is
a
good
beer
d
good
for
a
stout
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
a
lot
but
i
would
take
it
over
a
guinness
draught
any
day
an
excellent
choice
with
a
hearty
meal
like
stew
or
well
hell
anything
irish
drink
suprisingly
easy
considering
how
stout
it
is
not
as
dark
as
draught
but
still
very
dark
in
color
and
rich
in
its
malty
flavors
good
to
drink
out
of
a
bottle
or
in
a
glass
but
best
if
you
can
find
a
place
that
has
it
on
tap
i
have
never
been
a
stout
drinker
i
only
touch
the
stuff
if
i
am
in
ireland
or
a
single
bottle
on
rare
occasion
at
this
point
in
time
this
is
far
better
than
any
other
stout
i
have
tried
i
still
couldnt
use
this
as
a
session
drink
its
too
fullon
but
i
will
definitely
be
buying
it
again
its
a
bit
pricey
but
considering
the
flavour
the
value
is
not
bad
at
all
a
fine
stout
this
is
the
beer
that
convinced
me
that
ales
are
not
for
me
i
think
the
aroma
is
alright
and
as
for
appearance
there
is
something
about
beer
that
looks
like
coffee
that
turns
me
off
even
the
flavour
wasnt
that
appealing
to
me
i
found
this
to
be
a
slightly
bitter
beverage
even
the
mouthfeel
felt
very
thick
and
strong
with
little
in
the
way
of
carbonation
im
the
only
person
i
know
who
doesnt
really
like
guinness
so
its
not
you
people
its
me
i
enjoy
this
ttyle
of
guiness
much
more
than
the
draught
version
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
tastes
like
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
little
coffee
mixed
in
a
good
beer
but
dare
i
say
i
have
had
better
stouts
i
bought
this
before
i
realized
it
wasnt
the
one
with
the
widget
well
its
a
great
stout
in
and
of
itself
pours
dark
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
has
good
malted
notes
and
a
nice
dry
hoppy
finish
which
is
the
way
a
good
guinness
should
be
i
pulled
back
several
of
these
as
i
bought
a
six
its
a
good
representation
of
irish
dry
stouts
great
beer
pours
black
with
brown
hues
and
a
very
small
mocha
head
that
faded
fast
smells
sweet
with
chocolate
and
malty
notes
the
taste
starts
malty
with
a
bitter
finish
this
one
is
not
as
smooth
as
i
expected
for
guiness
but
still
had
a
bold
taste
that
was
enjoyable
it
had
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
which
was
frustrating
not
having
a
frothy
head
this
had
a
medium
body
lighter
for
a
stout
but
didnt
take
away
too
much
from
the
beer
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
and
worth
checking
out
for
those
who
are
into
stouts
enjoy
personally
what
this
gains
in
alcohol
content
over
the
draught
it
loses
in
taste
still
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
draught
much
thinner
also
with
a
more
bitter
taste
pour
is
very
dark
with
an
offwhitetan
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
aroma
is
coffee
and
choclate
malts
as
is
the
taste
fuller
more
rich
flavor
than
guinness
draught
the
only
think
i
would
have
liked
was
a
bit
more
hint
of
taste
in
the
smell
as
i
put
my
nose
in
the
half
empty
glass
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
pretty
much
black
color
with
a
nice
big
creamy
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
you
can
smell
aromas
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
caramel
very
malty
taste
chocolatey
and
coffee
like
tasting
with
some
bitterness
fairly
dry
finish
feels
fairly
thickheavy
in
the
mouth
with
little
carbonation
i
like
this
brew
much
more
than
the
standard
guinness
draught
it
just
seems
to
have
a
little
more
taste
a
much
much
better
introduction
to
stouts
for
a
newbie
d
very
filling
meal
beer
i
think
everyone
should
at
one
time
or
another
try
this
one
pours
a
light
shade
of
black
with
creamy
tan
guinness
head
smells
like
burnt
malt
slight
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
with
charred
taste
and
slight
hops
at
the
end
overall
a
deep
fullbodied
roasted
taste
no
coffee
or
chocolate
in
there
creating
a
dry
and
slightly
onedimensional
flavor
profile
overall
better
than
american
guinness
but
not
the
best
dry
stout
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
definitely
sessionable
a
little
bit
bolder
malt
profile
would
improve
it
in
my
book
d
this
beer
is
very
far
from
my
favorite
stout
beers
but
it
is
drinkable
and
a
lot
better
that
most
beer
that
available
here
d
overall
above
and
beyond
the
more
widely
served
draught
version
a
very
good
stout
d
average
drinkability
it
was
somewhat
enjoyable
and
went
down
moderately
easyhence
the
average
rating
it
was
nice
to
see
the
difference
between
guiness
and
guiness
extra
didnt
have
high
expectations
since
regular
ol
guinness
seems
to
be
a
shadow
of
what
it
should
be
this
stuff
though
much
different
pour
deep
brown
color
nice
fluffy
head
smells
like
burnt
malts
taste
oh
yeah
slight
burnt
malt
cocoa
a
nice
tart
finish
with
each
sip
overall
this
is
what
guinness
should
push
on
the
american
market
insteadof
their
ol
regular
draft
this
is
good
stuff
this
is
what
guiness
should
always
be
not
a
great
beer
but
a
good
solid
irish
stout
drinkability
you
anticipate
the
next
drink
while
youre
still
in
midsipgulp
i
find
this
one
consistent
throughout
temperature
change
of
chilled
to
warmed
i
was
pleased
a
good
beer
better
than
guinness
draught
by
a
lot
well
balanced
for
an
irish
stout
and
exhibits
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
in
a
style
that
is
too
often
onedimensional
i
have
this
beer
right
from
the
bottle
and
it
was
really
cold
this
beer
have
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
brown
almost
golden
head
it
looks
like
melted
chocolate
very
nice
taste
like
a
hard
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
different
but
i
really
like
it
j
overall
a
decent
dry
stout
its
much
better
than
the
nitro
draught
but
ive
had
much
better
stouts
mouthfeeldrinkability
sharper
than
ultimately
desirable
but
not
bad
either
the
activity
smoothes
out
right
before
the
swallow
and
carries
the
flavors
pretty
well
unfortunately
there
are
many
other
examples
that
frankly
deliver
a
more
rewarding
experience
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
beer
at
all
considering
price
and
regional
availability
overall
a
classic
nothing
special
by
ba
standards
and
while
i
wont
seek
this
beer
out
i
do
enjoy
it
every
year
on
st
pattys
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
im
hoping
to
go
to
ireland
in
a
few
years
and
try
a
more
authentic
brew
than
the
stuff
the
canadians
are
shipping
down
here
also
this
is
way
better
than
draught
handsdown
it
pours
a
nice
dark
black
with
slight
amberreddish
hints
in
the
light
the
smell
is
sweeter
than
the
actual
taste
i
tasted
some
sourbitterness
with
slight
burnt
flavors
it
seems
to
have
just
missed
the
sweet
spot
which
is
a
shame
though
i
still
prefer
it
over
the
draught
beer
they
offer
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
again
better
than
the
draught
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
its
no
worse
than
the
draught
and
i
usually
take
my
time
with
stouts
anyways
d
can
have
2
or
3
straight
or
quite
a
few
more
if
being
mixed
5050
with
smithwicks
irish
ale
this
brew
is
but
an
empty
shell
of
its
former
self
small
light
tan
head
which
stuck
around
to
the
finish
opaque
black
with
a
tinge
of
amber
around
the
edges
molasses
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
coffee
on
the
nose
a
strong
roast
flavour
dominates
the
palate
along
with
an
assertive
bitterness
the
flavour
doesnt
follow
through
with
the
hints
of
the
nose
its
all
roast
the
finish
is
short
but
not
crisp
and
the
body
is
a
little
thin
the
carbonation
is
moderate
giving
this
beer
a
fair
degree
of
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
dry
stout
lacking
a
little
complexity
though
and
personally
i
appreciate
the
extra
alcohol
present
i
think
it
adds
a
lot
to
the
flavor
of
this
brew
i
love
this
brew
the
extra
stout
is
twice
the
brew
of
the
guinness
draught
its
richer
creamier
has
more
bite
and
alcohol
for
the
same
money
i
like
my
brew
more
on
the
bitter
side
and
this
gets
me
there
fyi
if
you
work
in
tight
spaces
with
others
you
might
want
to
take
the
next
day
off
final
statement
not
a
bad
stout
indeed
however
not
remarkable
i
dont
buy
this
often
as
there
are
better
fish
to
fry
but
its
respectable
for
being
made
by
labbatt
definately
nothing
you
should
steer
clear
of
i
find
this
beer
more
drinkable
than
the
standard
guinnessdraught
good
over
all
flavor
great
appearance
worth
trying
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
at
first
but
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
it
really
its
just
an
average
stout
that
is
way
too
much
on
the
bitter
end
this
is
quite
different
from
the
traditional
guinness
worthy
of
a
try
for
the
curious
but
not
repeated
tryings
very
dark
brown
with
a
mediumsized
light
tan
pillowy
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thick
film
smell
is
sweet
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
toffee
light
citrus
broth
earth
and
wood
taste
is
similar
with
the
roasted
malts
being
bold
from
start
to
finish
also
more
wood
and
a
little
cherry
in
there
towards
the
dry
finish
it
has
a
mediumfull
body
dry
texture
and
low
carbonation
just
a
good
all
around
stout
id
drink
this
quite
often
if
it
werent
for
the
price
tag
two
years
ago
this
would
have
been
heaven
for
me
but
much
better
beers
have
come
along
since
still
definitely
drinkable
and
ok
for
a
quick
stouty
fix
but
definitely
not
a
choice
beer
if
there
isnt
anything
more
appealing
its
a
good
choice
otherwise
theres
probably
better
options
d
easy
enough
to
take
and
has
some
flavour
not
my
first
choice
for
a
stout
though
there
are
some
better
local
choices
that
cost
much
less
despite
the
fact
that
this
was
brewed
here
in
canada
d
3
0
after
a
few
and
i
need
a
change
of
pace
only
now
the
question
is
what
beer
to
drink
on
st
josephs
day
the
6
00
abv
can
be
felt
here
but
i
never
got
the
impression
that
this
beer
was
too
strong
a
bit
of
lacing
is
clinging
to
the
edges
of
my
glass
as
i
swish
this
around
my
mouth
sure
its
not
that
easily
found
in
bottles
when
i
go
out
but
this
is
certainly
a
old
stanby
of
mine
and
quite
a
solid
beer
for
a
night
out
with
buddies
or
after
a
hearty
meal
now
if
we
could
get
the
foreign
extra
stout
on
u
s
soil
this
was
definitely
the
best
guinness
extra
stout
ive
had
in
the
last
couple
years
i
followed
this
up
with
a
can
of
guinness
draught
which
wasnt
as
tasty
drinkability
this
is
the
guinness
for
me
good
and
cheap
but
of
nice
quality
i
end
up
drinking
this
a
bit
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
the
taste
is
a
little
strong
and
bitter
but
it
grows
on
you
the
abv
is
too
high
to
be
sessionable
i
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
but
thats
about
it
this
would
be
a
good
winter
beer
its
a
little
out
of
step
with
the
spring
season
ahh
this
does
bring
back
memories
for
ive
enjoyed
many
a
pint
of
guinness
at
many
a
bar
over
the
years
to
be
honest
it
is
not
my
favorite
stout
i
can
think
of
many
i
would
prefer
for
their
thicker
mouthfeels
and
more
present
chocolate
flavors
but
ill
still
always
love
you
guinness
pours
a
nice
big
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
but
has
a
lacing
that
is
lacking
the
color
is
black
but
i
noticed
as
i
was
pouring
you
could
see
through
the
beer
coming
out
smell
is
very
very
bready
and
bisquity
almost
like
playdough
like
when
i
was
a
kid
wow
not
very
appealing
i
smell
no
malts
no
coffee
no
roastiness
nothing
taste
is
off
has
a
slight
roastiness
but
mostly
an
off
flavor
thats
very
disturbing
that
flavor
mellows
out
but
the
sweetsour
flavor
is
still
present
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
making
it
a
bit
fizzy
overall
i
wouldnt
try
this
again
without
the
knowledge
that
its
fresh
or
not
tampered
with
this
was
from
johns
and
something
is
wrong
for
sure
drinkability
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
for
a
brew
dont
plan
on
trying
it
ever
again
ive
learned
my
lesson
cheers
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
welcomed
with
a
frothy
tan
head
on
top
the
dark
liquid
head
stayed
around
till
it
was
finished
not
as
creamy
a
head
as
out
of
the
nitro
cans
smell
was
strong
with
roasted
malt
flavors
along
with
coffee
and
chocolate
scents
slightly
sweet
smell
as
well
almost
carmel
like
this
beer
is
dry
to
the
taste
with
powerful
roasted
malt
flavors
and
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
much
like
the
smell
bitter
and
dry
in
the
after
taste
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
bold
malt
flavor
but
is
very
drinkable
much
better
than
the
nitros
cans
full
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
why
is
the
nitrogen
crap
on
tap
everywhere
but
not
this
this
is
actually
quite
good
if
i
havent
enforced
it
enough
this
is
some
really
strong
stuff
the
bitterness
might
be
overwhelming
for
some
with
my
changed
taste
the
extra
stout
to
me
now
tastes
like
the
first
time
i
had
guinness
light
in
case
you
forgot
thats
my
nickname
towards
the
draught
those
who
think
the
light
is
too
strong
should
definately
stay
away
from
this
otherwise
indulge
drinkability
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
overall
but
it
needs
some
work
id
rather
drink
a
regular
guinness
draught
any
day
as
it
is
creamier
better
balanced
and
more
delicious
the
citrus
hop
flavor
at
the
end
of
the
sip
was
too
overbearing
for
me
if
you
can
get
past
that
detail
however
this
isnt
half
bad
das
dry
stouts
go
this
one
is
wonderful
seriously
tastes
like
grape
juice
not
bad
just
not
great
i
would
definitely
drink
it
with
a
meal
this
one
is
imported
all
the
way
from
canada
i
suppose
the
reason
for
this
is
so
it
can
be
imported
i
remember
feeling
like
a
bad
boy
early
on
ordering
my
guinness
from
a
bar
and
smoking
a
cigarillo
an
early
gateway
beer
for
many
quite
a
bit
better
than
the
guiness
draft
version
this
brew
is
more
potent
both
in
flavor
and
abv
appears
a
dark
brown
nearing
black
with
the
typical
creamy
head
smells
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
coffee
taste
is
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
with
a
nice
smokiness
to
it
not
too
complex
but
good
none
the
less
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
slightly
offwhite
surprisingly
creamy
head
smells
of
dark
malts
with
a
malty
upfront
taste
finishes
with
a
wellbalanced
hop
bitterness
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
are
found
throughout
it
finishes
rather
dry
with
some
slightly
acidic
aftertaste
overall
this
is
very
decent
and
is
only
noticeably
off
in
the
finish
d
not
really
digging
this
beer
too
much
seems
awkward
at
best
with
all
the
stouts
available
today
some
are
inclined
to
diss
this
old
boy
not
me
d
easily
drinkable
but
im
not
racing
to
the
fridge
for
another
im
spoiled
drinkability
its
okay
nothing
special
the
pronounced
bite
on
the
toungue
isnt
real
pleasant
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
taste
is
surprisingly
full
if
youre
used
to
regular
guinness
draught
nutty
lots
of
roasted
malt
lemonlike
acidity
all
over
the
palate
and
if
you
really
try
theres
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
as
well
finishes
appropriately
bitter
in
that
typical
guinness
way
mouthfeel
is
much
fuller
but
less
creamy
than
the
draught
version
extremely
dry
and
carbonation
isnt
overbearing
this
one
isnt
as
full
bodied
or
flavourful
as
a
lot
of
stouts
ive
had
but
nonetheless
a
very
respectable
product
from
the
true
originals
of
the
style
and
drinkable
in
quantity
you
can
feel
the
history
of
the
beer
in
every
sip
and
this
may
be
the
only
guinness
id
give
time
to
in
the
future
this
beer
always
looks
good
in
the
glass
maybe
it
doesnt
have
the
cascading
effect
of
the
draught
but
still
it
has
a
nice
dark
color
almost
black
with
brown
highlights
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
aring
and
leaves
no
real
lacing
the
smell
is
slightly
roasty
and
slightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
roasty
sourness
there
as
well
the
taste
is
a
classic
not
the
best
in
the
world
not
the
worst
the
bottled
version
isnt
as
creamy
but
iis
stronger
and
in
my
opinion
has
more
character
flavors
of
roasted
malt
some
bitter
hops
in
the
end
and
a
little
bit
of
salty
caramel
underlying
it
all
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
not
particularly
creamy
but
refreshing
definitely
has
its
place
while
not
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
this
will
most
certainly
fill
the
bill
in
most
circumstances
id
recommend
having
it
with
a
beef
roast
or
other
heavy
meal
or
as
something
to
sit
by
the
fire
with
while
you
watch
the
snow
fall
outside
overall
i
have
in
the
past
decried
guinness
as
a
non
stout
drinkers
stout
id
say
the
extra
stout
is
more
along
the
lines
of
what
a
good
stout
couldshould
be
although
its
far
from
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
was
curious
to
see
the
differences
between
this
and
the
regular
guinness
draught
stout
the
look
and
texture
are
about
the
same
although
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sour
and
not
quite
as
pleasant
as
i
remember
the
taste
does
have
a
bit
of
an
extra
kick
perhaps
its
even
a
touch
hoppier
than
youd
expect
overall
its
similar
to
the
original
guinness
with
a
slightly
stronger
guinness
flavor
bitter
finish
included
and
a
little
less
head
basically
if
you
enjoy
guinness
youll
enjoy
this
iteration
of
it
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
tried
and
back
then
i
thought
it
didnt
get
any
more
bitter
than
this
now
after
several
american
double
india
pale
ales
and
russian
imperial
stouts
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
in
that
department
still
its
a
standard
of
irish
dry
stouts
the
nonnitro
kind
and
one
of
the
originals
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
absolutely
have
to
try
and
the
best
part
of
this
is
you
will
probably
enjoy
it
this
beer
poured
a
deep
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
head
fell
faster
than
the
draught
normally
does
the
smell
is
very
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
robust
and
coffee
like
there
is
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
this
is
a
delicious
beer
which
i
enjoy
a
lot

although
i
think
the
draught
version
is
a
little
smoother
in
the
drinkability
category
md
smooth
and
drinkable
like
regular
guinness
full
but
light
bodied
with
a
nice
flavor
easier
to
drink
than
regular
guinness
very
nice
drinkability
a
great
beer
to
sit
down
and
have
a
few
of
without
thinking
about
it
too
hard
an
intensely
flavored
stout
and
while
more
interesting
on
the
palate
in
its
flavors
less
smooth
on
the
tongue
i
want
to
mix
this
beer
with
guinness
draught
i
think
that
blend
might
be
better
than
either
of
them
individually
all
around
not
a
perfect
beer
but
appearance
and
mouthfeel
make
it
a
true
classic
didnt
quite
get
the
perfect
pour
especially
for
such
a
heavy
beer
this
will
certainly
be
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
from
now
on
stargherkingdec

and
i
enjoy
stouts
its
quite

5drinkabilityafter
three
pints
i
begin
to
hear
my
grandmother
voice
in
that
deep
brogue
saying
12
oz
with
some
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
no
freshness
date
it
pours
black
with
a
halfinch
tan
head
that
has
medium
to
fine
bubbles
and
good
lacing
by
the
end
it
smells
of
dark
fruits
hops
and
maybe
some
caramel
it
has
a
medium
body
that
smooths
as
it
warms
and
it
tastes
of
roastedblack
malts
raisins
vinous
malts
and
a
bitterness
from
both
the
hops
and
the
black
malts
it
leaves
a
long
bitter
finish
tastes
better
than
the
draught
but
is
not
quite
as
drinkable
now
for
those
of
you
who
say
that
guinness
either
extra
stout
or
draught
is
the
say
all
end
all
of
stouts
i
disagree
however
having
said
that
i
really
think
that
this
beer
is
the
standard
for
a
stout
many
beers
have
been
based
upon
this
one
and
the
fact
that
they
havent
changed
the
recipe
in
two
and
a
half
centuries
really
says
something
guinness
is
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
full
bodied
the
beer
was
properly
carbonated
there
was
a
time
when
my
measure
for
beer
crack
was
guiness
there
are
many
stouts
that
surpass
guiness
however
guiness
is
in
a
class
all
by
itself
all
and
all
the
beer
was
great
it
was
quite
drinkable
and
a
great
choice
with
beef
or
pork
but
just
thinner
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
the
beer
pours
an
impressive
and
relatively
black
solid
the
brown
head
that
disappears
quickly
brings
it
down
a
point
the
smell
is
good
like
a
mocha
cappichino
hmm
hm
the
taste
is
slightly
chocolatly
i
say
slightly
because
it
isnt
as
sweet
as
guinness
draught
original
and
that
isnt
a
good
thing
the
taste
is
rounded
out
with
a
slightly
bitter
coffee
taste
it
is
really
excellent
and
smooth
however
every
now
and
then
some
pungent
alcoholic
tastes
will
ring
through
and
really
ruin
it
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
slightly
thick
with
no
carbonation
coating
of
the
mouth
as
for
the
drinkability
the
coffee
bitterness
does
get
to
you
during
a
big
gulp
but
for
drinking
regularly
it
is
good
not
as
good
as
the
original
but
then
again
few
are
best
as
a
session
and
nothing
to
drink
steadily
pours
a
near
black
with
a
fairly
small
dark
tan
head
that
mostly
dissipates
quite
rapidly
but
leaves
a
nice
ring
the
whole
way
down
smell
is
matly
with
bitter
chocolate
and
some
hints
of
hops
tastes
bittersweet
with
the
chocolate
coming
through
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
thick
enough
to
have
presence
without
impacting
the
drinkability
drinkability
considering
that
i
am
used
to
drinking
higher
abv
in
a
stout
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
very
drinkable
for
its
style
i
would
definetly
order
this
in
a
bar
probably
my
favorite
popular
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
that
works
just
as
well
for
a
session
beer
as
guinness
draught
does
except
extra
stout
tastes
so
much
better
ive
had
it
before
ill
be
having
it
again
many
times
im
sure
drinkability
if
you
can
enjoy
a
stout
you
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
the
dryness
might
turn
your
palate
into
a
wasteland
of
sorts
but
it
also
allows
this
beer
to
be
consumed
en
masse
cheers
sipped
it
watching
some
fawlty
towers
and
ripping
yarns
damn
good
drinkability
is
really
good
but
its
very
filling
good
work
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
back
in
the
summer
before
my
senior
year
first
bottle
i
was
disgusted
second
was
better
third
i
was
in
love
guinness
is
an
acquired
taste
not
for
the
corona
or
bud
light
drinkers
of
the
world
more
carbonitation
than
draught
though
not
as
smooth
extra
stouty
this
is
a
great
introduction
to
the
stout
porter
style
and
an
old
standby
for
me
are
there
better
stouts
out
there
sure
are
there
ones
that
are
as
accessible
and
can
be
had
from
walmart
not
that
i
know
of
i
think
this
one
is
a
good
and
drinkable
beer
from
reading
other
reviews
of
greater
bas
i
cannot
compare
this
one
to
any
others
from
the
vast
selection
of
guinness
extra
stout
but
i
do
think
it
is
a
good
stout
definitely
one
you
can
fall
back
on
if
its
all
you
can
get
at
your
grocery
store
overall
guinness
on
tap
is
much
preferred
at
least
this
is
more
drinkable
than
the
bottledcanned
pub
draught
overall
i
wish
there
was
a
category
for
influence
i
cant
imagine
the
impact
this
beer
has
had
as
being
a
threshold
beer
for
massmarket
drinkers
personally
i
cut
my
teeth
into
beers
because
of
guinness
and
im
sure
im
not
alone
even
though
many
of
the
attributes
of
this
beer
dont
stand
up
to
other
stouts
ive
had
through
the
years
its
hard
not
to
respect
the
impact
and
influence
its
had
in
its
history
unfortunately
with
the
huge
mouthfeel
comes
limited
drinkability
i
simply
cannot
drink
more
than
three
of
these
without
being
completely
full
oh
well
such
is
life
all
in
all
quite
good
for
a
style
i
usually
think
is
fairly
bland
i
guess
those
centuries
of
brewing
have
taught
them
something
after
all
d
i
could
usualy
drink
alot
of
these
but
this
isnt
as
smooth
or
easy
to
drink
then
a
draught
i
always
prefer
this
to
the
draught
its
more
edgy
and
bold
in
flavor
good
easy
drinkin
easy
to
find
i
need
a
stout
right
now
but
dont
feel
like
going
out
of
my
way
stout
but
theres
better
out
there
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
but
far
from
the
best
of
the
bunch
compared
to
guinness
draught
id
give
the
nod
to
the
extra
stout
in
a
close
contest
good
stout
definitely
better
than
guinnesss
nitro
offerings
of
late
not
something
you
can
pound
all
night
but
a
few
in
a
sitting
with
some
good
food
would
make
a
nice
evening
deep
mahogany
colored
not
black
with
garnet
hues
around
the
edges
a
fluffy
head
of
meringue
floats
a
full
inch
atop
looking
chalky
and
oily
at
the
same
time
it
recedes
a
bit
but
then
waits
and
goes
nowhere
aroma
is
initally
tinny
a
bit
hoppy
and
finally
rich
malty
flavor
is
surprisingly
similar
to
the
aroma
initially
sort
of
metallic
followed
by
some
hops
and
then
at
last
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
highlights
a
smokey
bitter
flavor
lingers
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
finishes
bubbly
definitely
not
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
as
out
of
the
tap
i
guess
i
know
now
why
i
usually
dump
it
into
lamb
stew
instead
of
drinking
it
drinkability
varies
i
used
to
love
this
beer
more
than
any
other
stout
i
could
drink
it
exclusively
for
entire
weeks
since
i
have
begun
to
sample
the
wider
world
of
double
and
imperial
stouts
it
has
lost
its
allure
i
tried
this
one
out
of
curiosity
since
it
had
been
a
while
its
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
this
is
far
superior
to
the
guinness
draught
and
obviously
a
classic
within
its
style
the
fact
that
this
is
so
rich
and
heavy
makes
this
rather
hard
to
drink
large
quantities
of
its
pretty
tasty
tho
a
must
every
st
patricks
day
or
after
a
tough
day
at
work
on
reflection
i
think
this
beer
seems
a
lot
like
a
stout
dressed
up
in
a
dopplebocks
clothing
the
heavy
maltiness
medium
mouthfeel
etc
just
seem
more
like
a
dopplebock
to
me
and
im
not
a
big
fan
of
dopplebocks
at
the
moment
however
this
might
be
a
good
intro
beer
for
those
looking
to
branch
into
the
style
so
maybe
theres
a
place
for
this
brew
after
all
on
the
palate
this
beer
feels
great
it
is
fairly
heavy
but
also
is
easy
to
drink
once
you
have
finished
a
mouthfull
of
this
brew
it
leaves
you
thirstier
than
when
you
started
giving
you
a
great
reason
to
take
another
drink
it
also
has
in
my
opinion
a
perfect
balance
of
carbonation
for
this
style
of
beer
it
seems
like
anymore
and
it
would
bee
overwhelming
and
anyless
and
it
would
be
flat
overall
this
beer
is
great
and
is
easy
to
drink
ill
always
be
a
fan
of
guiness
and
i
know
that
i
will
buy
unmeasurable
amounts
of
it
in
the
future
this
beer
taste
like
a
coffe
cup
because
its
malts
and
adjoincts
special
for
the
evening
and
take
like
a
gourmet
beer
with
high
cuisine
mexican
food
and
american
is
good
too
not
touch
the
greatness
of
its
sister
special
export
but
is
99
recommended
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
black
has
a
thin
tan
head
it
has
no
noticable
aroma
and
has
a
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
before
eating
some
cookie
dough
i
found
it
a
little
hard
to
drink
but
that
all
changed
as
it
warmed
and
as
i
had
the
food
with
it
there
is
a
straightforward
stout
profile
in
the
flavor
that
all
in
all
make
it
a
decent
choice
when
choosing
stouts
notes
solid
brew
very
drinkable
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
all
in
all
its
really
a
plain
middleoftheroad
beer
the
half
in
my
glass
quickly
joined
its
other
half
in
my
pan
to
make
room
for
better
beers
i
have
in
my
fridge
d
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
comming
back
in
a
hurry
this
offering
from
guinness
is
certainly
not
as
smooth
as
the
draught
it
is
much
more
bitter
than
i
would
like
it
is
fairly
dark
but
a
little
light
penetrates
through
it
looks
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
unlike
draught
im
not
sure
id
buy
this
beer
again
instead
of
a
roasted
flavor
it
has
more
of
a
burnt
flavor
next
time
i
will
opt
for
the
draught
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
and
not
surprisingly
something
i
enjoy
once
in
awhile
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
however
stouts
with
somewhat
more
character
the
draft
bottle
and
nitro
cans
are
pretty
ugly
but
this
bottled
stubbie
is
well
worth
keeping
around
i
could
session
this
one
and
i
often
do
pours
black
as
pitch
totally
opaque
ruby
highlights
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
three
finger
head
is
tan
or
brown
and
bubbly
with
good
retention
but
poor
lacing
the
smell
is
not
strong
but
distinct
sweet
burnt
malt
a
flavor
of
deep
roasted
barley
molasses
and
bakers
chocolate
is
strong
and
provides
most
of
the
bitterness
the
hops
are
percived
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
but
manages
to
boost
the
mouthfeel
there
is
a
bittersweet
residue
finish
but
mostly
dry
and
clean
guinness
extra
stout
is
smooth
full
bodied
and
bold
in
flavor
but
carbonated
and
balanced
well
enough
to
keep
a
high
drinkability
the
beer
poured
the
expected
black
with
the
darkest
brown
edges
at
only
the
very
extreme
edges
of
the
glass
it
poured
with
a
tan
foamy
head
that
retained
very
well
with
soem
fine
lacing
about
half
an
inch
left
around
the
inside
top
of
the
glass
the
beer
smelled
of
roasted
malt
molasses
and
some
coffee
it
tasted
strongly
of
the
roasted
malts
with
some
chocolate
and
also
some
burnt
flavors
too
a
medium
body
with
a
dryness
to
the
palate
as
well
this
is
one
of
the
beers
i
have
to
thank
for
getting
me
into
good
craft
beer
as
far
as
this
style
goes
i
prefer
this
over
the
now
standard
guinness
draught
or
murphys
this
is
highly
drinkable
a
good
irish
dry
stout
a
good
example
of
another
classic
guinness
extra
stout
offers
a
good
malt
base
with
assertive
amounts
of
roasted
grains
and
chocolate
grains
for
added
flavor
and
complexity
a
descent
hop
bittering
adds
a
zip
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
the
nose
holds
a
lactic
souring
that
i
beleive
adds
to
the
beer
the
same
souring
shows
up
in
the
flavors
as
well
finishes
a
charcoal
and
chalk
like
dryness
very
light
alcohol
flavors
shine
through
the
roasted
grain
bittering
its
a
much
better
beer
than
the
dry
stout
especially
without
the
nitro
this
beer
does
not
need
it
this
is
drinkable
has
a
slight
sour
astringency
pours
pitch
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
some
decent
lacing
smell
is
like
an
exaggerated
version
of
the
draught
burnt
malts
and
metallic
with
maybe
a
hint
of
burnt
coffee
taste
is
more
of
the
same
burnt
grain
and
astringent
metal
with
faint
burnt
coffee
notes
a
little
harsh
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
the
draught
but
still
nothing
special
overall
a
far
better
showing
than
draught
but
still
cant
hold
a
stick
to
even
a
decent
american
micro
stout
this
baby
pours
out
extremeley
dark
it
looks
a
little
bit
intimidating
the
first
time
you
see
it
the
head
is
alright
but
its
not
that
notable
the
smell
is
not
very
noticeable
which
is
kind
of
nice
because
its
quite
subtle
it
hints
at
the
hops
the
taste
is
interesting
the
first
wave
of
taste
is
simultaneously
bitter
and
acidic
not
very
pleasant
however
this
initial
unpleasantness
gives
way
to
a
big
malty
taste
that
feels
nice
and
broad
on
the
tongue
this
part
is
excellent
the
malts
dont
wash
away
too
quickly
leaving
a
nice
bit
of
flavor
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
i
think
is
the
most
interesting
part
about
this
beer
it
feels
weighty
but
in
a
good
way
it
feels
like
this
beer
has
substance
the
initial
thickness
gives
way
to
a
malty
grittiness
that
is
just
so
addictive
the
beer
is
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
other
beers
because
the
harshness
of
the
hops
tends
to
grate
on
the
tongue
but
it
is
something
that
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
again
i
can
still
recall
not
being
able
to
finish
one
of
these
back
in
college
and
dreaded
drinking
them
with
friends
at
notre
dame
tailgaters
a
few
years
back
maybe
ive
developed
a
taste
for
other
styles
but
this
one
is
just
your
average
stout
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
appearance
especially
poured
out
of
a
nitro
can
great
carbonation
and
head
smooth
mouthfeel
though
no
impressive
smell
its
not
too
bad
at
all
smooth
very
flavorful
could
take
some
getting
used
to
miller
light
and
corona
fans
probably
shouldnt
bother
could
be
addictive
why
did
i
wait
26
years
to
give
this
beer
a
second
chance
note
according
to
the
bottles
the
extra
stout
was
brewed
in
canada
but
the
draught
imported
directly
from
ireland
beer
is
good
happy
free
exotic
beering
not
quite
guinness
on
steroids
maybe
protien
shakes
and
power
bars
though
notes
well
my
first
encounter
with
guinness
is
over
and
i
must
say
that
this
beer
does
not
live
up
to
the
hype
surrounding
it
it
is
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
but
it
is
not
incredibly
thick
heavy
or
bitter
is
it
a
great
beer
not
in
my
book
it
isnt
is
it
a
bad
beer
certainly
not
this
is
definately
a
fallback
beer
for
me
i
need
something
with
more
flavor
and
more
body
a
respectable
beer
nonetheless
it
is
certainly
better
than
beamish
but
it
is
nowhere
near
as
good
as
shakespeare
stout
pours
very
dark
as
a
guinness
should
not
as
pretty
as
the
nitro
cans
in
terms
of
foaming
and
action
in
the
glass
a
large
over
3
finger
head
develops
first
sip
reveals
a
much
more
bitter
taste
than
the
regular
guinness
a
sweet
taste
like
bittersweet
chocolate
aftertaste
leaves
a
slightly
roasted
flavor
a
nice
and
pretty
average
stout
that
leaves
me
wanting
the
normal
guinness
not
as
smooth
as
the
nitro
cans
this
is
the
first
time
for
a
guinness
for
me
poured
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
onefinger
head
which
took
a
little
while
to
disipate
with
slight
lacing
has
a
sweet
smell
i
have
to
get
use
to
the
taste
but
not
really
that
bad
the
extra
stout
has
a
medium
body
to
it
the
after
taste
is
not
that
bad
but
i
guess
i
have
to
get
use
to
it
as
of
right
now
the
drinkability
is
not
to
high
the
finish
is
a
bit
sour
lacks
any
roasted
bitterness
or
hop
bitterness
though
the
hops
are
slightly
evident
its
not
nearly
as
bad
as
the
guinness
draught
but
it
still
isnt
a
good
stout
this
one
is
a
highly
drinkable
stout
much
better
than
i
remember
it
being
although
i
dont
feel
that
it
lives
up
to
all
the
hype
surrounding
this
brew
if
you
have
dismissed
this
beer
its
probably
worth
giving
it
another
try
a
good
offering
from
the
guinness
line
poured
out
similarly
to
traditional
guinness
with
a
nice
head
that
was
very
dense
and
brown
cream
colored
not
a
very
strong
aroma
but
hints
of
earth
coffee
and
herbs
were
noted
taste
was
quite
nice
flavors
of
coffee
hops
and
a
smokelike
quality
very
filling
decent
mouthfeel
slightly
creamy
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
guinness
and
dry
stouts
pours
the
expected
pitch
black
color
with
an
averagesized
tan
frothy
head
the
nose
is
of
very
intense
sweet
roasted
malts
it
smells
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
the
taste
is
strong
and
appealing
also
a
little
tart
and
whattya
know
a
million
times
tastier
than
guinness
draught
i
notice
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
coffee
beans
both
brought
on
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
not
light
at
all
but
probably
a
little
thinner
than
mediumbodied
im
sure
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
i
got
tired
of
them
pours
a
creamy
one
finger
head
that
leaves
lace
on
sides
of
glass
as
it
fades
ebony
color
that
only
bright
direct
sunlight
can
begin
to
penetrate
i
smell
roasted
malt
with
a
faint
sweetness
bittering
is
definitely
there
but
i
dont
think
overdone
has
a
faint
sour
taste
that
i
havent
heard
anyone
talk
about
b4
tried
another
and
still
get
faint
sour
doesnt
ruin
it
but
doesnt
help
it
either
finishes
quite
dry
i
prefer
this
swarthy
fellow
over
macros
but
i
cant
get
past
the
sour
mmmm
pours
a
nice
deep
blackbrown
with
a
really
great
thicky
looking
tanbrown
head
it
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
it
is
fairly
bitter
but
splendid
it
is
sharp
with
hops
yet
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
coating
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
maybe
not
quite
as
much
as
regular
guinness
though
overall
a
solid
stout
a
good
standby
that
is
available
everywhere
avoid
the
draft
its
practically
sweet
water
not
so
good
al
in
some
ways
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
typical
draught
you
get
here
in
the
states
seems
richer
and
more
interesting
i
should
do
a
blind
ab
tasting
somehow
i
still
like
this
once
in
a
while
this
is
a
classic
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
nitro
stuff
but
this
is
a
great
beer
this
is
an
allaround
good
stout
nice
tan
head
with
good
retention
of
foam
the
color
is
a
coffee
or
cola
brown
the
nose
isnt
great
if
you
work
at
it
you
get
deep
rich
malt
but
it
is
surprisingly
not
that
forthcoming
considering
how
heavy
it
is
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
very
coating
heavy
malt
i
can
remember
the
extra
stout
having
alot
more
pucker
in
past
examples
that
ive
had
now
its
almost
mild
hmm
the
finish
is
still
fairly
dry
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
bitter
hops
having
a
bomber
of
this
stout
during
a
cool
late
evening
summer
session
is
fantastic
all
in
all
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
and
will
most
definitely
be
buying
it
again
it
may
not
be
the
best
out
there
but
it
does
pretty
well
nothing
can
match
guinness
from
a
tap
the
draught
cans
come
close
this
bottled
version
is
quite
different
from
both
tap
and
the
draught
cans
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
nice
and
dark
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
head
stays
around
for
the
life
of
the
beer
smells
great
as
good
as
any
version
of
guinness
the
difference
is
in
the
feeltaste
this
is
a
lighter
thinner
beer
than
the
draughttap
version
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
more
watery
just
thinner
dont
expect
the
same
feeltaste
as
the
draughttap
version
youll
be
disappointed
while
i
normally
like
the
thicker
draught
version
i
do
sometimes
like
this
version
better
because
it
is
lighter
for
example
a
hot
summer
day
at
a
bbq
i
would
rather
drink
a
few
bottles
of
this
than
the
draught
can
type
not
as
heavy
on
you
you
can
really
down
these
with
enjoyment
drinkability
the
dry
aftertaste
makes
it
tough
to
whack
these
bad
boys
drinkability
ill
admit
it
i
cant
have
more
than
two
for
some
reason
i
just
cant
that
doesnt
necessarily
mean
that
this
is
a
bad
drinking
beer
this
beer
just
wears
me
out
perhaps
that
is
another
reason
i
only
purchase
this
about
once
a
year
beer
pours
a
very
dark
black
not
quite
opaque
as
i
could
still
see
some
resemblences
of
light
while
holding
it
up
to
a
bright
snowy
nc
sky
the
smell
is
of
coffee
and
maybe
chocolate
lots
of
hop
bitterness
with
touches
of
chocolate
and
coffee
maybe
a
nutraisin
there
is
a
lingering
bitterness
long
after
the
initial
taste
that
resonates
on
the
back
and
sides
of
the
tongue
and
on
the
back
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
due
to
the
dryness
and
extreme
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
one
pint
of
this
beer
and
my
tastebuds
are
shot
and
therefore
not
a
session
beer
a
toast
to
guinness
pours
a
slightyly
watery
dark
color
the
general
appearance
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
not
as
thick
as
one
would
hope
a
descent
offwhite
head
forms
but
does
not
last
very
long
the
smell
and
taste
are
rather
average
with
so
many
other
great
stouts
out
there
i
would
not
recommend
searching
this
one
out
however
when
the
pickings
are
slim
give
it
a
go
this
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
the
head
is
thick
and
creamy
it
is
tan
it
fades
slowly
leaving
thick
laces
all
over
the
glass
it
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
coffee
taste
is
mild
not
too
aggressive
it
tastes
malty
with
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
it
is
slightly
bitter
coffee
flavor
is
slight
there
is
a
slightly
metalic
taste
to
it
but
not
too
bad
it
is
just
a
little
over
carbonated
it
goes
down
smooth
leaving
a
malty
taste
on
the
palate
this
beer
would
make
a
good
session
beer
due
to
its
lower
alcohol
content
and
its
non
aggressive
flavors
this
beer
will
probably
not
frequent
my
refrigerator
because
there
are
so
many
better
beers
out
there
dont
waste
your
time
on
this
one
i
wasnt
sure
how
id
feel
about
this
beer
after
having
a
bad
expirience
with
guinness
draught
at
a
restaurant
extra
stout
is
almost
black
in
color
head
is
large
tan
and
fairly
creamy
aroma
is
roasted
similar
to
coffee
a
light
sweetness
is
also
detected
taste
is
also
similar
to
roasted
coffee
but
this
is
probably
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
to
love
there
is
a
light
sweetness
here
especially
in
the
dry
finish
but
not
enough
to
make
this
great
in
my
book
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
i
think
polishing
off
a
six
pack
might
be
a
little
much
this
is
my
first
irish
dry
stout
i
need
a
few
more
to
have
a
better
picture
of
the
style
feels
ok
in
the
mouth
but
as
it
is
try
it
is
pretty
thin
too
is
it
drinkable
well
sorta
not
for
me
though
give
me
the
regular
guinness
please
respect
beer
indeed
pours
black
hardly
any
light
can
sneak
through
with
a
nice
brown
head
a
couple
inches
high
too
bad
the
foam
doesnt
last
for
long
but
it
leaves
small
traces
along
the
glass
smells
roasted
almost
burnt
malt
also
some
coffeelike
notes
taste
is
full
with
coffee
taste
same
as
its
aroma
and
some
bitterness
need
to
sip
but
could
have
a
few
over
the
evening
thicker
more
body
and
flavor
than
guinness
draught
drinkability
certainly
good
to
quaff
i
wouldnt
sit
down
with
it
on
a
regular
basis
as
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
for
a
macro
stout
however
this
must
be
the
best
superior
to
the
bland
draught
recommended
w00t
pours
a
dark
slightly
reddish
brown
with
a
1
12
inch
head
the
head
eventually
shrank
to
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
and
stayed
there
for
the
remainder
of
the
drink
its
not
quite
as
beautiful
to
look
at
as
guinness
draught
but
it
has
a
nice
appearance
all
the
same
smell
is
of
coffee
and
dark
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
about
on
par
with
most
stouts
in
terms
of
thickness
but
the
carbonation
was
a
little
much
the
taste
is
very
bitter
and
the
roasted
malts
really
come
through
the
extra
stout
is
like
guinness
draughts
evil
twin
brother
the
draught
is
smooth
and
creamy
while
the
extra
stout
has
a
much
more
substantial
bite
to
it
i
think
the
bitterness
is
a
little
overthetop
but
extra
stout
wins
some
points
for
having
character
to
it
its
not
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
drink
all
night
but
it
could
make
a
nice
changeofpace
brew
drinkability
is
pretty
low
stick
to
the
tap
version
for
this
brew
the
balance
and
flavor
are
better
and
better
balanced
mouthfeel
is
chewier
as
well
the
foremost
stout
in
name
is
just
middleoftheroad
in
the
glass
at
least
when
it
comes
from
a
bottle
thick
on
the
palate
but
not
murky
easy
to
swallow
and
enjoyable
all
around
a
easy
beer
to
drink
and
to
cook
with
as
far
as
guinness
goes
i
enjoy
this
bottled
guinness
better
than
the
nitrocan
i
havent
had
it
on
tap
in
ages
so
its
not
fair
to
compare
in
that
area
i
like
it
but
i
dont
think
this
is
the
best
stout
i
remember
being
at
the
bar
claiming
to
be
an
irish
guy
and
never
having
had
tried
guinness
so
i
ordered
one
yuck
but
man
i
gotta
suck
it
up
i
gotta
like
this
stuff
i
am
irish
so
i
force
fed
it
to
myself
for
a
few
weeks
then
i
acquired
the
taste
and
could
not
get
wnough
of
this
stuff
i
then
sat
my
brother
down
ordered
him
a
guinness
and
shoved
it
down
his
throat
for
a
few
weeks
and
he
as
well
became
a
guinness
lover
it
is
hard
to
just
drink
guinness
all
night
but
is
a
great
started
beer
and
oh
the
enjoyment
watching
a
guinness
settle
oh
the
frothy
first
sip
damn
i
am
thirsty
black
as
back
of
a
cave
poured
from
the
1
pint
6
ox
bottle
it
flashed
deep
ruby
at
edge
of
my
glass
its
34
brownish
tan
head
fell
quickly
leaving
some
lace
and
persistant
rings
on
side
marking
each
level
as
i
drank
faint
aroma
of
roasted
malt
taste
gets
stronger
as
this
stout
warms
and
i
detect
something
metalic
drinkale
and
went
well
with
my
pot
of
chilli
and
hot
corn
bread
it
arrived
in
a
nitrocan
which
i
was
happy
to
find
provided
a
decent
tan
creamy
head
on
top
of
the
cloudy
chocolate
brown
stout
those
classic
tiny
bubbles
were
definitely
present
the
aroma
much
more
mild
than
other
stouts
ive
had
recently
a
very
mild
coffee
and
toast
smell
it
had
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
surprisingly
similar
to
what
id
get
out
of
a
tap
the
taste
however
was
watery
to
me
nice
flavors
of
coffee
toffee
and
toasted
nuts
but
all
very
mild
i
guess
ive
been
drinking
much
more
flavorful
concentrated
stouts
lately
the
pint
went
down
almost
too
easy
still
a
good
brew
but
nothing
in
it
to
knock
my
socks
off
poured
from
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
the
appearance
is
beautiful
black
with
ruby
edges
and
a
large
brown
head
i
can
smell
dark
roasted
malts
and
coffee
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
coffee
and
roasted
malts
make
up
most
of
the
flavor
there
is
a
strong
hop
flavor
that
last
from
start
to
finish
as
feel
has
kind
of
smoky
aftertaste
this
is
very
fine
irish
stout
i
can
say
still
one
of
the
best
this
beer
was
thin
to
mediumbodied
and
left
me
wanting
more
ok
i
think
ill
have
another
edit
well
the
next
bottle
was
better
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
be
a
real
fan
of
this
beer
i
dont
find
enough
flavour
up
front
to
balance
the
dry
finish
i
knocked
up
a
couple
of
the
scores
in
the
end
tastes
great
the
burnt
coffee
bean
taste
of
guinness
along
with
a
fine
chocolate
maltiness
in
the
back
and
this
is
the
kicker
is
a
very
nice
kiss
of
roasted
hops
the
bitter
taste
in
leaves
in
your
mouth
is
divine
pours
with
a
twofinger
light
brown
head
that
is
thick
and
frothy
leaving
a
ton
of
lace
totally
black
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
nose
is
barely
there
cant
get
anything
distinguishable
starts
with
a
strong
roasted
almost
burnt
coffee
flavor
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
goes
good
with
dry
peanuts
a
world
classic
i
dont
drink
too
much
of
it
anymore
and
there
are
many
bolder
beers
out
there
today
but
there
are
no
real
flaws
here
just
a
very
good
beer
ok
i
admit
it
i
am
of
irish
heritage
so
i
love
my
guinness
no
matter
what
version
the
extra
stout
is
definitely
their
most
flavorful
version
it
pours
as
black
as
any
guinness
should
and
has
a
nice
rocky
tan
head
that
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
behind
can
you
say
beautiful
i
did
so
anyway
it
has
a
nice
clean
aroma
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
unmalted
barley
and
some
faint
coffee
like
aromas
make
it
really
irresistable
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
extreme
a
nice
sweet
beginning
that
follows
with
a
decent
bitterness
from
the
dark
malts
that
almost
overpower
the
experience
i
probably
shouldnt
give
it
all
5s
but
it
is
guinness
drinkability

it
isnt
the
most
balanced
stout
on
the
market
but
it
is
raw
and
edgy
and
a
great
effort
from
such
a
highvolume
brewery
overall
a
nice
drinkable
stout
not
overly
heavy
and
very
enjoyable
overall
a
decent
stout
but
not
remarkable
this
one
is
going
down
as
a
decent
nightcap
but
i
dont
think
id
drink
these
all
night
as
is
probably
intended
id
probably
want
something
a
bit
more
exciting
but
it
can
be
a
solid
find
at
a
convenience
store
with
a
limited
selection
if
you
just
want
one
for
the
night
at
home
guinness
is
one
of
those
beers
that
seems
to
have
some
kind
of
cult
like
following
behind
it
and
i
dont
understand
why
in
the
way
of
stouts
there
are
scores
upon
scores
of
much
better
choices
out
there
i
dont
think
guinness
sucks
i
simply
think
there
is
alot
more
hype
concerning
guinness
than
it
deserves
it
pours
jet
black
which
is
good
i
like
porters
and
stouts
that
you
cannot
see
light
through
it
laces
the
glass
well
too
it
looks
great
the
smell
is
very
nice
as
well
a
little
bit
of
dry
roasted
malt
perhaps
a
sweetened
coffee
like
smell
maybe
some
chocolate
the
taste
starts
out
wonderful
but
goes
south
from
there
it
has
a
sweet
malty
taste
to
it
at
the
beginning
which
is
nice
however
there
is
a
very
clearly
noticeable
almost
metallic
like
taste
on
the
finish
it
isnt
totally
awful
but
i
certainly
dont
share
the
enthusiasm
that
many
others
seem
to
have
for
this
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
which
is
good
a
brew
this
dark
should
be
heavy
it
goes
down
smooth
and
except
for
the
metallic
finish
thing
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
good
stout
not
total
crap
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
choose
it
first
mmm
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
a
nice
stout
slightly
woodsmoky
and
bitter
its
quite
smooth
going
down
and
its
good
the
whole
way
it
has
a
nice
dark
color
and
a
thick
head
guinness
is
always
better
from
the
tap
but
the
extra
stout
is
a
good
substitute
ive
always
liked
the
extra
stout
from
guinness
and
pick
it
up
on
occasion
if
im
in
the
mood
easy
to
drink
a
few
if
youve
never
tried
a
dry
stout
before
but
you
have
sampled
and
enjoyed
guinness
draught
i
recommend
you
give
extra
stout
a
shot
in
many
ways
you
can
sense
its
similarities
to
draught
but
at
the
same
time
theres
no
question
that
this
is
a
unique
beer
as
if
the
6
00
abv
wasnt
enough
to
tell
you
its
significantly
different
than
your
standard
pint
of
guinness
overallthis
is
a
good
stout
drink
it
cold
and
do
not
let
it
warm
up
has
its
redeeming
qualities
and
a
lot
of
fans
and
it
certainly
will
do
i
tend
to
prefer
murphys
myself
but
many
will
disagee
and
this
is
much
easier
to
get
so
enjoy
black
as
coal
with
a
hefty
beige
head
covering
the
crown
good
looking
pint
to
start
barely
smelled
a
thing
as
i
tipped
the
glass
for
the
first
drink
taste
was
very
good
wheat
coffee
and
small
amounts
of
burnt
malt
mouthfeel
was
smooth
leaving
nothing
behind
i
really
liked
the
way
this
tasted
dry
crisp
and
clean
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
remind
you
its
there
ill
have
this
again
a
true
classic
even
if
i
have
outgrown
it
because
of
ba
i
only
drink
this
when
im
slumming
it
12
oz
bottle
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
decent
lacing
pleasant
buttered
toast
smell
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
taste
is
of
toasted
grains
and
black
coffee
has
a
bitter
black
coffee
after
taste
not
bad
for
a
mass
produced
stout
and
better
tasting
than
its
canned
draught
sibling
pours
almost
pure
black
with
amber
glints
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
glass
the
light
tan
head
quickly
dissipates
to
a
foam
ring
that
leaves
plenty
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
a
strong
almost
acidic
roasted
bitterness
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
grainy
roasted
barley
bitterness
up
front
which
leads
to
faint
chocolate
and
bready
notes
and
then
quickly
returns
to
a
strong
slightly
acidic
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
cedary
character
becomes
apparent
hop
bitterness
is
medium
to
high
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
grainy
and
roughly
carbonated
this
is
a
very
sharp
tasting
stout
that
is
completely
dominated
by
the
roasted
burnt
barley
some
how
the
taste
really
works
the
intensity
is
reminiscent
of
very
hoppy
beers
in
a
weird
way
definitely
not
as
balanced
as
the
extra
stout
available
in
the
states
though
i
still
love
the
stuff
pours
a
deep
deep
ruby
with
a
creamy
light
beige
colored

of
some
toasted
scorched
malts
and
some
lowalpha
challenger

some

with

roasty
and

blackened

taste
with
some
dark

poking
through

dry
and

on
the

better
than
guinness
ondraught
though
still
brewed
in
toronto
to
north
americans
id
love
to
have
guinness
in
ireland
fraternizing
a
local
dublin
pub
being
pegged
as
an
american
just
by
the
lines
left
in
a
guinness
pint
showing
how
many
gulps
in
took
you
to
finish
it
ill
bet
a
denizen
of
dublin
leaves
only
three
lines
after
joining
ba
ive
discovered
a
whole
new
world
of
beer
and
guinness
isnt
the
pinnacle
it
once
was
for
me
but
it
will
always
remain
a
special
thing
in
my
life
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
creamy
head
head
disappears
too
quickly
leaving
some
lace
on
the
glass
smells
very
roasty
like
coffee
taste
is
a
rich
roasted
malt
with
shades
of
charcoal
and
burnt
flavors
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
medium
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
slick
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
far
different
and
imo
better
than
the
nitro
stuff
that
you
find
lots
of
places
pretty
drinkable
and
a
good
irish
stout
this
beer
is
black
in
color
with
a
slight
hint
of
red
when
held
to
a
light
the
thick
tan
head
has
good
retention
and
leaves
moderate
lacing
behind
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
roasted
grains
upon
tasting
the
bitterness
is
noticable
right
away
the
flavor
of
burnt
coffee
the
finish
is
bitter
also
this
beer
is
a
medium
bodied
and
almost
creamy
quite
drinkable
but
not
really
a
session
beer
the
best
of
the
guinness
stouts
ive
reviewed
pours
to
a
generous
tan
head
and
deep
ruby
black
color
aroma
is
sweetmocha
dessertlike
flavor
is
a
solid
bittersweet
combination
of
malts
and
roasted
barley
for
the
espresso
flavor
effect
finishes
roasty
nicely
bitter
but
not
nearly
as
dry
as
the
draught
stout
i
forgot
how
good
this
stuff
was
i
will
definitely
ask
for
it
in
the
future
a
nice
stout
doesnt
go
down
as
well
as
the
draught
though
guinness
extra
stout
is
a
staple
dry
stout
i
actually
prefer
the
extra
stout
over
the
nitro
guinness
for
the
sheer
complexity
that
this
one
has
over
its
counterpart
taste
was
delightful
coffeebeans
bakers
chocolate
again
plenty
of
burnt
malt
taste
and
a
nice
dry
hoppy
bittereness
this
beer
has
a
bitter
taste
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
after
each
sip
finish
is
dry
mouthfeel
is
midly
creamy
thinner
than
i
anticipated
but
lovely
nonetheless
good
solid
beer
good
availability
worth
a
shot
no
doubt
overall
very
drinkable
but
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
of
the
foreign
export
version
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
guinness
though
and
this
stout
gets
my
wholehearted
approval
a
very
tasty
brew
overall
a
very
good
very
accessible
stout
its
as
easy
to
find
as
it
is
to
drink
of
all
the
bottled
and
canned
guinness
products
this
is
the
best
second
only
to
the
various
foreign
extra
stouts
this
is
an
attractive
beer
it
is
pitch
black
with
the
good
head
to
be
expected
from
a
guinness
stout
the
rest
of
the
beer
unfortunately
is
somewhat
of
a
disappoint
the
smell
is
that
of
coffee
and
i
think
that
i
also
detected
hints
of
barley
the
taste
is
of
course
a
bunrt
coffee
taste
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
the
alcohol
is
not
particularly
well
covered
up
by
the
beer
it
goes
down
a
bit
harsh
for
my
tastes
the
taste
how
to
describe
it
there
is
a
bitterness
here
that
you
certainly
wont
find
in
the
draught
version
of
guinness
dry
in
the
mouth
with
the
taste
of
smoked
barleymalt
coming
through
in
the
sip
the
mouthfeel
and
the
swallow
do
i
detect
cola
bean
in
there
too
there
is
a
lingering
smokiness
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
unpleasantly
reminiscent
of
cigarettes
but
this
is
a
minor
problem
mouthfeel
is
chewy
rich
and
mellow
all
at
the
same
time
great
to
have
around
on
cold
nights
with
beef
stew
shepherds
pie
or
yorkshire
pudding
for
dinner
drinkability
definelty
a
beer
to
relax
and
enjoy
its
vatic
pronouncements
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
this
beer
and
im
definitely
glad
i
became
reaquainted
its
quite
a
lot
of
fun
even
if
it
is
brewed
in
canada
i
limited
myself
to
one
of
these
tonight
but
i
could
have
had
all
three
since
i
started
trying
other
craft
beers
i
had
strayed
away
from
guinness
this
definitely
renewed
a
long
time
love
for
me
have
to
give
hardtarget
the
nod
for
helping
me
find
this
one
a
classic
stout
to
be
sure
overall
guinness
extra
stout
was
easily
drinkable
with
no
real
drawbacks
or
complaints
associated
with
it
a
standardbearer
for
the
style
big
doughy
light
tan
head
collapses
crazy
the
beer
is
black
but
shows
very
dark
red
edges
against
the
light
lots
of
sticky
psycho
lacing
excellent
sweet
molasses
in
the
bready
nose
nice
front
is
sweet
and
tangy
developing
malty
toffee
through
the
middle
gets
considerably
more
tangy
in
the
finish
but
leaves
sourish
astringent
this
is
good
theres
really
a
lot
of
character
a
lot
of
flavor
not
crazy
about
the
sour
finish
overall
impression
thats
a
meal
heavy
and
heavy
handed
the
alcohol
isnt
tasted
but
has
a
fair
kick
its
heavy
enough
that
im
happy
after
just
one
another
seems
a
bit
much
but
ill
go
for
this
beer
again
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
nitroguinny
superior
to
the
regular
draft
which
is
cheap
bitter
beer
and
some
coffee
taste
smooth
basic
in
style
whose
formula
is
basically
unchanged
for
the
longest
time
a
midsip
chocolate
sweet
roast
and
spicey
malt
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
a
smuch
as
their
draft
and
finally
if
you
put
all
the
bottled
canned
or
widget
enhanced
beers
in
the
same
room
they
are
all
out
classed
by
the
extra
stout
the
only
thing
better
is
guinness
on
tap
overall
this
is
a
fine
stout
and
a
good
one
when
you
want
a
bit
of
strength
without
the
normal
heaviness
trying
this
after
having
tried
the
guinness
draught
in
the
nitro
bottle
appearance
is
very
strange
its
pretty
dark
but
the
red
brown
hints
show
through
and
its
apparent
that
it
is
transparent
just
really
dark
the
three
finger
head
is
pretty
thick
and
tan
but
the
bubbles
are
quite
large
and
it
ends
up
looking
like
swiss
cheese
receding
unevely
the
first
thing
i
smelled
when
i
smelled
this
was
skunky
rubber
obviously
not
a
pleasant
smell
there
is
some
wheaty
smells
behind
it
and
a
bit
of
malt
too
but
the
alcohol
is
also
apparent
in
the
smell
compared
to
the
guinness
draught
this
is
a
little
bit
better
but
not
much
really
there
is
a
bit
of
charred
taste
to
it
with
a
subtle
earthy
flavor
but
theres
really
nothing
on
any
other
level
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
fruitiness
but
barely
any
at
all
and
the
overriding
taste
is
just
a
dry
bitter
flavor
and
in
this
beer
its
certainly
not
from
hops
its
just
kind
of
dry
and
chalky
tasting
the
aftertaste
is
all
bitter
and
chalky
the
mouthfeel
is
disappointingly
thin
as
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
extra
stout
after
having
the
draught
its
thin
dry
and
has
a
ton
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
granted
that
it
was
free
i
would
take
most
other
stouts
over
this
one
this
beer
given
that
i
had
some
expectations
of
it
to
be
better
than
regular
guinness
was
quite
disappointing
the
body
is
pretty
heavy
but
i
feel
that
the
flavor
is
a
little
light
the
balance
is
very
nice
with
a
strong
roasty
presence
meeting
up
with
sweet
chocolate
flavors
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
and
hurts
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
you
can
get
so
much
better
out
of
a
stout
it
is
far
superior
to
guinness
draught
but
it
still
needs
help
ah
this
is
the
true
guinness
not
that
draught
crap
that
they
have
out
now
poured
out
a
midnight
black
color
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
left
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
towards
the
end
smell
consisted
roasted
malts
and
toasted
grains
soft
aroma
of
coffee
comes
into
mind
as
well
taste
was
malty
chewy
with
some
undertones
of
coffee
and
chocolate
that
knocks
against
the
palate
aftertaste
was
roasted
flavors
that
seemed
to
last
forever
just
an
amazing
stout
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
felt
for
this
beer
more
might
of
been
too
much
but
less
would
not
have
helped
either
methinks
full
bodied
drinkability
in
my
opinion
the
flavor
punch
is
so
powerful
one
is
plenty
drinking
several
im
not
so
sure
though
not
for
the
light
hearted
beer
fan
i
surely
would
like
to
try
it
again
once
i
have
some
more
brews
under
my
belt
fastforward
7
years
and
99
ba
karma
points
later
and
this
beer
is
boldly
flavored
with
malt
and
a
mild
roasted
flavor
there
is
just
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
and
a
semi
dry
finish
its
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
goes
great
with
bbq
ribs
much
more
character
than
any
of
the
nitro
versions
tasty
and
largely
overlooked
i
think
more
people
should
give
the
carbonated
version
a
shot
its
no
shakespeare
or
anything
but
its
a
solid
beer
that
most
drinkers
pass
on
for
the
imho
gimmicky
and
inferior
nitro
version
classic
no
competent
yes
pours
a
wonderful
midnight
black
with
a
light
tan
head
who
doesnt
enjoy
the
look
of
this
one
in
a
pint
glass
massive
aroma
of
roasted
malts
flavor
is
malty
and
extremely
well
balanced
i
love
the
viscous
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
canada
does
a
great
job
with
this
one
and
i
love
the
fact
that
its
available
virtually
everywhere
as
with
most
stouts
in
my
opinion
its
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
a
row
very
dark
almost
opaque
black
the
tiny
bit
of
light
that
gets
through
is
dark
ruby
color
rocky
brown
head
good
malty
smell
but
not
a
very
strong
aroma
taste
is
roasted
malt
coffee
and
carmel
with
a
little
dark
chocolate
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
i
was
anticipating
very
nice
mouthfeel
thick
and
creamy
very
smooth
and
drinkable
not
my
favorite
stout
but
very
nice
i
have
to
say
i
will
always
have
a
softspot
for
guinness
extra
stout
i
cut
my
beer
teeth
on
it
so
to
speak
when
previously
heineken
or
maybe
samuel
adams
were
the
height
of
tasteful
beer
although
im
more
interested
in
more
complex
or
extreme
beers
at
this
point
ges
is
always
a
nice
friend
to
fall
back
on
color
is
very
dark
brown
with
clarity
of
motor
oil
nice
big
rocky
brownishtan
head
which
eventually
dissolves
but
leaves
a
good
amount
of
brown
lacing
smell
is
malt
sweet
fat
and
buttery
and
taste
is
much
the
same
in
my
opinion
this
has
very
little
black
malt
bitterness
or
roastiness
compared
to
other
stouts
i
have
had
although
those
features
are
present
the
first
adjectives
to
come
to
mind
are
malty
buttery
fat
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
incredibly
soft
texture
is
medium
substantial
but
definitely
not
thick
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
probably
the
best
nonhoppy
nonbitter
relatively
nonroasty
beer
ive
had
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
not
labelled
well
enough
to
differentiate
it
from
guinness
with
a
widget
have
two
or
more
of
the
widget
beer
one
of
these
is
plenty
drinkability
not
bad
definitely
a
session
beer
maybe
a
little
overboard
on
the
roasted
flavors
though
definitely
has
more
character
than
the
nitrogenated
draught
version
but
i
kinda
missed
the
cascade
effect
but
hey
when
im
jonesing
fer
a
guinness
theres
bombers
of
this
at
the
711
whilst
not
as
creamy
as
guinness
draft
this
is
probably
the
better
of
the
two
brews
it
pours
a
black
as
hell
colour
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
which
is
long
lasting
and
nice
and
sticky
the
smell
is
rather
sweet
with
chocolate
and
malt
being
hinted
at
throughout
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
then
bitter
chocolate
and
coffe
flavouring
then
it
gets
a
bit
roasty
but
still
sweet
and
finishes
nice
and
dry
this
is
quite
simply
a
classic
brew
though
not
as
classic
as
it
used
to
be
now
that
its
contracted
in
canada
its
overall
goodness
is
down
a
tad
too
i
might
add
thats
quite
drinkable
and
always
enjoyable
ahh
now
this
is
what
guinness
should
be
almost
perfect
the
barkeep
let
me
watch
him
pour
this
pint
beautiful
artwork
the
top
of
the
glass
is
flowing
with
this
white
fluffy
head
that
slowly
disipates
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
beneath
it
a
dark
dark
drink
tar
black
with
next
to
no
light
shining
through
excellent
smell
big
roasted
malts
floral
citrus
hops
dark
chocolate
burnt
coffee
and
dry
toast
big
powerful
taste
the
roastyness
really
kicks
through
their
is
a
bit
of
lemon
which
seems
odd
in
a
stout
somewhat
heavy
slick
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
according
to
the
bar
tab
pours
black
as
night
nice
big
soapy
tan
head
that
lasts
a
good
while
smells
quite
sweet
not
like
the
draught
slight
caramel
scent
thick
mouthfeel
light
bitterness
nice
sweetness
very
malty
with
slight
chocolate
notes
goes
down
very
smooth
nice
lacing
the
whole
way
down
very
enjoyable
definitely
better
than
the
draught
bottle
guinness
extra
stout
was
highly
recommended
by
friends
of
mine
i
recently
came
into
stouts
and
porters
and
have
loved
them
so
when
i
saw
ges
at
the
store
i
had
to
pick
it
up
i
bought
the
22
oz
brown
bottle
with
the
famous
guinness
logo
when
poured
it
became
a
dark
coffee
looking
beer
with
a
mocha
frosty
head
that
stayed
on
very
well
then
when
i
expected
to
smell
greatness
i
was
dissapointed
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
traces
of
coffee
but
a
very
subtle
smell
instead
of
the
strong
smell
in
other
stouts
the
taste
is
below
average
on
a
basis
of
stouts
the
coffee
and
roasted
malts
are
strong
in
the
beginning
but
a
very
metallic
taste
comes
on
strong
at
the
end
and
wont
let
go
horrible
feels
average
in
the
mouth
very
full
and
dense
i
barely
could
finish
my
22
oz
beer
so
i
couldnt
drink
anymore
had
to
switch
to
rogue
stout
below
average
for
a
stout
very
nice
never
had
it
until
recently
i
think
it
could
become
an
easy
standby
a
heck
of
a
lot
better
than
guinness
draught
much
more
bolder
in
flavor
than
the
draught
version
overall
i
think
the
creaminess
of
guinness
draught
appeals
to
me
more
but
this
is
still
very
good
all
in
all
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
is
so
much
better
perhaps
i
should
have
tasted
this
next
to
an
american
pale
pilsner
the
taste
of
extra
stout
is
twofold
roasty
and
bitter
neither
of
these
flavors
are
strong
enough
to
be
distinctive
or
offensive
theyre
merely
present
theres
also
a
bit
of
dryness
in
extra
stout
this
isnt
bad
but
for
my
money
there
are
far
better
stouts
available
guinness
extra
stout
and
bass
ale
were
my
favorites
in
my
preba
days
i
havent
had
this
one
in
at
least
a
year
though
and
a
lot
of
good
beer
has
crossed
my
palate
in
that
time
it
actually
holds
up
pretty
well
this
is
a
quality
stout
that
ill
continue
to
go
back
to
again
and
again
i
always
seem
to
pick
up
some
guinness
or
beamish
once
every
few
monthspours
a
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
with
some
light
fruitiness
taste
is
cofeelike
and
highly
roasted
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
hey
its
a
classic
and
readily
availabe
i
go
back
to
it
alot
the
drinkability
is
good
because
while
this
is
not
a
really
interesting
stout
it
is
quite
quaffable
pours
out
to
a
very
near
black
dark
brown
forming
a
mediumtan
head
which
is
foamy
and
poofy
in
size
with
excellent
lacing
and
very
good
retention
with
a
vigorous
pour
carbonation
is
mild
to
medium
aroma
is
lightly
fruity
and
dry
with
pronounced
roasted
character
mild
caramel
and
vanilla
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
bright
roasted
finish
and
mediumbody
taste
begins
with
an
initial
herbal
hoppiness
followed
by
suggestions
of
sweet
chocolate
caramel
and
coffee
a
touch
of
metal
a
dash
of
raisins
alcohol
is
notable
in
the
middle
then
there
is
a
pronounced
roasted
astringent
bite
and
an
herbal
bitterness
lingering
in
the
finish
forever
the
finish
is
a
bit
unbalanced
with
the
bitterness
compared
to
the
nitro
or
tap
versions
this
one
has
more
hop
flavor
and
astringent
roasted
character
in
the
finish
as
well
as
the
raisins
in
the
middle
the
alcohol
is
also
more
pronounced
the
finish
is
dry
and
sharp
which
hurts
its
drinkability
as
well
notes
alright
this
stuff
caught
me
off
gaurd
dont
expect
beer
when
you
drink
this
i
couldnt
help
but
think
coffee
and
desert
while
drinking
it
i
was
actually
drinking
these
at
9am
before
classes
because
it
reminds
me
of
coffee
so
much
the
nitro
bottle
pours
a
fine
sustained
head
black
as
night
this
brew
hits
your
nose
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
taste
starts
with
that
malt
and
ends
with
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
it
holds
well
in
the
mouth
with
a
fair
heaviness
the
bitter
finish
is
not
a
good
bitter
in
my
book
which
lowers
it
just
below
the
good
range
i
will
definitely
drink
it
if
offered
but
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
cushiony
light
tan
head
not
bad
smell
is
modest
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
soapy
chocolate
pretty
mild
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
starts
with
a
sweet
roasty
malt
body
with
hints
of
chocolate
but
then
the
big
roasted
metallic
coffee
bitterness
kicks
in
finish
is
dry
and
roasty
bitter
feels
a
tad
creamy
and
goes
down
easy
enough
a
lovely
almost
black
colour
with
a
nice
tan
head
it
has
a
little
burnt
smell
also
a
little
roasted
smell
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
bitter
and
a
bit
smokey
there
is
a
hint
of
the
chocolate
in
the
taste
aswell
it
has
a
long
after
taste
i
think
this
beer
should
be
nice
with
a
piece
of
chocolate
nice
brew
after
a
nice
meal
not
a
great
stout
but
a
fine
stout
a
stout
with
a
history
stamina
i
like
this
guinness
i
like
it
just
fine
overall
nothing
spectacular
though
guinness
has
a
reputation
mainly
because
people
arent
aware
of
the
vast
world
of
other
stouts
that
exist
not
to
say
that
the
beer
is
bad
by
any
stretch
but
its
far
from
the
best
as
well
paid
2
49
for
a
bomber
id
drink
it
again
in
the
right
circumstances
but
with
the
strong
flaver
and
bitterness
its
not
right
for
all
the
time
not
as
good
as
i
remember
a
black
color
pours
with
a
thick
creamy
brown
head
that
is
quite
persistent
the
head
gets
quite
rocky
over
time
as
well
there
is
a
slightly
roasted
aroma
with
a
bit
of
sweet
grain
character
it
has
a
lightly
bitter
astringent
finish
fairly
thin
in
its
consistency
some
roast
character
is
here
and
it
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
twang
to
it
in
the
finish
overall
this
beer
is
quite
disappointing
and
much
worse
than
i
remember
it
is
missing
the
character
that
i
was
expecting
it
to
have
not
too
bad
but
certainly
not
great
either
ill
start
this
review
off
by
saying
that
this
stuff
is
way
better
than
regular
guinness
imo
poured
a
dark
brew
with
a
tan
head
smaller
head
then
regular
guinness
tasted
slightly
drier
more
of
a
nutty
taste
the
6
abv
is
nice
i
enjoy
buying
the
large
bottles
of
this
for
about
2
25
instead
of
a
whole
six
pack
because
i
usually
dont
want
more
than
a
couple
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
imo
i
really
could
only
handly
1
of
these
1pt
6s
at
a
time
share
it
with
a
friend
and
let
it
settle
if
you
think
this
is
going
to
taste
anything
like
guinness
draught
you
will
be
thoroughly
dissapointed
take
it
as
it
is
a
beer
and
judges
it
only
by
its
characteristics
i
didnt
completly
enjoy
this
beer
mainly
because
of
its
sweetbitter
contrast
that
didnt
work
well
for
me
try
it
if
you
must
but
there
are
many
more
fish
in
this
sea
that
will
make
you
much
happier
this
beer
is
a
punisher
i
love
heavy
rich
stouts
but
this
beer
is
just
too
onedimensional
i
just
need
more
from
a
stout
and
they
arent
lying
when
they
said
it
is
extra
stout
grrr
i
miss
the
foreign
extrastouts
i
was
getting
from
a
shady
offlicense
in
london
its
not
my
favourite
stout
the
harshness
is
a
bit
too
abrupt
still
i
have
to
give
some
credit
to
guinness
for
not
wussifying
this
stout
like
so
many
other
breweries
have
whatever
it
may
be
its
not
stout
lite
a
rich
color
coupled
with
a
rich
coffeelike
taste
and
a
well
rounded
mouthfeel
made
this
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
left
a
bit
of
dry
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
palate
that
was
very
nice
nice
drinkability
wellrounded
tasteful
and
satisfying
this
beer
is
a
dak
black
opaque
liquid
with
a
lovely
tan
head
of
foam
aromas
are
of
burnt
coffee
molasses
chocolate
alcohol
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
very
roasty
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
is
thick
yet
creamy
with
a
bit
of
an
astringent
twinge
on
the
end
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
as
well
this
is
good
stuff
had
this
one
in
a
12oz
bottle
love
guinness
should
love
guinness
extra
stout
poured
the
expected
very
dark
color
with
an
inch
tall
head
that
hung
around
the
aroma
was
mostly
just
roasted
malts
slightly
stronger
aroma
than
my
beloved
guinness
draught
the
taste
is
somewhat
burned
with
some
bitterness
to
back
it
up
surrounded
by
a
creaminess
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
doesnt
hold
its
ground
when
placed
against
guinness
draught
poured
dark
with
a
one
inch
head
musty
smell
on
first
nosepass
deep
roasted
malt
on
second
carmelly
mocha
on
third
seemed
to
have
a
highly
charged
mouthfeel
first
taste
was
a
dry
coffeish
taste
surprisingly
light
before
i
started
tasting
other
highly
ranked
stouts
i
used
to
think
this
brew
had
the
strongest
roasted
malt
first
taste
in
existence
now
it
seems
ordinary
this
was
a
rereview
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
i
was
correct
about
this
beer
being
just
average
unfortunatly
i
was
first
time
round
dissapointed
regular
guinness
daught
from
irelandengland
is
better
pours
a
light
brown
color
that
quickly
shifts
to
a
dark
brown
tastes
like
coffee
with
cream
whereas
most
other
stouts
i
have
tried
taste
like
straight
black
coffee
a
very
creamy
smooth
flavor
and
mouthfeel
cant
drink
too
much
though
fills
you
up
still
very
tasty
although
not
the
best
tasting
stout
ever
color
is
certainly
dark
smell
is
very
faint
chocolate
with
hops
taste
leaves
somethng
to
be
desired
roasted
hops
and
barley
hint
of
nut
hint
of
chocolate
not
very
interesting
infinitely
better
than
guinness
draught
but
to
be
avoided
if
a
competent
stout
is
available
i
can
tell
that
ive
been
spoiled
if
i
didnt
know
that
this
was
a
stout
i
would
have
thought
that
it
was
a
porter
the
beer
is
definitely
dark
but
light
comes
through
more
than
the
edges
and
has
a
good
reddishbrown
color
the
aroma
is
faint
the
flavor
has
an
interesting
bit
of
wood
ash
to
it
and
a
surprising
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
least
for
a
dry
irish
stout
still
its
fairly
thin
and
not
complex
at
all
it
did
mix
well
with
dogwood
ipa
and
created
a
nice
hoppy
porterlike
thing
that
was
pretty
damn
tasty
bytheby
my
bottle
said
5
abv
i
have
tasted
alot
of
good
strong
stouts
since
my
first
bottled
guinness
but
i
am
still
in
the
bag
for
this
brew
the
best
widely
available
stout
in
the
world
try
eating
a
small
piece
of
good
chocolate
the
next
you
try
this
beer
they
go
together
great
when
i
took
a
sniff
just
after
pouring
i
was
surprised
by
a
fairly
nondistinguished
nose
to
the
beer
happily
the
palate
made
up
for
that
and
then
some
my
tongue
was
literally
assaulted
by
a
big
delicious
roasty
espresso
barley
shock
wave
soon
to
be
followed
by
an
overthetop
chocolate
character
and
slight
sourness
intended
to
impart
a
quenching
character
which
blended
wonderfully
with
a
big
roasted
barley
astringency
and
kiss
of
hops
in
the
finish
ebony
is
the
color
on
the
pour
my
idea
of
how
all
beer
should
look
the
size
of
the
head
is
medium
frothy
in
texture
and
light
chocolate
in
color
as
it
erodes
a
fine
covering
of
lace
is
formed
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
roasted
and
toasted
grain
malt
sweet
and
crisp
and
clean
start
is
lightly
sweet
full
of
malt
top
is
full
to
middling
in
its
feel
finish
is
crisply
acidic
hops
purposeful
in
their
spiciness
dry
lingering
aftertaste
a
decent
quaffing
beer
but
give
me
one
pulled
from
the
cask
in
ireland
and
id
be
a
happy
and
satisfied
man
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
ive
been
meaning
to
try
for
a
while
but
have
been
holding
back
for
some
reason
i
guess
its
kind
of
what
i
expected
pours
a
deep
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
moderate
cascading
head
aroma
is
sweet
not
much
else
taste
is
sweet
malts
with
a
cola
like
mouthfeel
a
little
light
for
a
stout
the
finish
is
somewhat
bitter
and
flavors
of
espresso
and
chocolate
linger
on
the
palate
this
beer
was
a
little
lacking
in
the
roasted
category
which
i
look
for
and
enjoy
in
stouts
but
it
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
even
so
its
a
rather
tasty
beer
with
a
slight
hop
finish
completely
drinkable
but
a
good
stout
should
really
be
well
more
stout
just
a
tad
more
oomph
is
needed
here
for
a
really
great
beer
ng
dark
black
color
with
a
tan
head
roasted
coffee
aroma
taste
is
strongly
of
roasted
malts
with
a
barely
noticeable
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
seems
thin
probably
because
i
like
most
people
are
used
to
the
rich
feel
of
the
nitrotap
this
is
a
good
dry
stout
but
there
are
many
better
examples
available
now
drinkability
again
i
kept
finding
myself
comapring
this
to
the
tap
version
of
guinness
not
the
same
character
flavor
texture
or
smoothness
ive
come
to
associate
with
guinness
just
a
good
solid
stout
to
enjoy
this
stout
poured
opaque
black
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
presisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
sweet
dark
malt
and
some
cocoa
the
taste
was
sweetish
dark
malt
cocoa
coffee
and
caramel
some
bitterness
but
not
much
really
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
overall
dry
though
sweeter
than
other
guinness
versions
the
body
was
mediumfull
bodied
with
low
carbonation
feel
the
drinkability
was
very
nice
i
discovered
that
this
version
of
guinness
does
not
make
as
good
a
black
and
tan
as
the
others
this
version
does
not
float
as
well
extra
stout
is
a
much
better
product
than
the
nitro
draught
guiness
although
the
contract
brewing
in
canada
takes
away
a
bit
of
the
guinness
mystique
this
is
still
a
solid
stout
this
is
an
old
stand
by
for
me
when
i
dont
want
anything
too
expensive
or
dont
want
to
reward
myself
with
something
better
a
decent
stout
and
ill
try
to
explain
i
dont
really
get
any
smell
from
this
one
ive
sniffed
away
and
i
dont
really
detect
anything
with
the
exception
of
a
possible
very
slight
roasty
aroma
pours
black
and
has
a
slight
tan
head
a
nice
overall
appearance
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
for
me
i
would
equate
it
to
a
lowfat
chocolate
milk
not
thick
enough
for
regular
the
drinkability
is
ok
the
only
thing
that
comes
to
mind
when
drinking
this
is
that
its
a
little
weak
i
can
put
down
a
couple
of
them
though
the
overall
taste
lacks
a
little
as
well
again
i
taste
something
a
little
roasty
i
thank
guinness
for
being
something
completely
different
for
most
american
swill
drinkers
and
thanks
to
my
brother
dante
for
nudging
my
interest
in
giving
this
beer
another
shot

can
be
the

it
just
so
happens
to
be

well
the

strong

medium

with

the

definitely
a
lot
more
bitter
than
guinness
draught
this
stuff
is
worlds
better
than
guinness
draught
as
far
as
flavor
i
cant
see
this
extra
stout
as
a
session
brew
though
nevertheless
its
one
heluva
stout
i
wish
the
bitterness
wouldnt
be
so
assertive
because
it
detracts
from
the
creamy
roasty
character
that
i
enjoy
so
much
in
a
stout
pours
a
nearblack
with
a
tan
head
the
head
doesnt
last
long
if
only
this
were
a
draft
the
smeel
is
nice
and
rich
coffee
and
a
hint
of
raisin
the
taste
is
rich
and
roasted
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
performing
a
trapeze
act
with
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
satisfying
rich
and
dark
very
tasty
brew
but
lacking
that
draft
quality
i
think
i
prefer
the
drought
i
will
try
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
to
compare
to
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brownish
black
color
and
formed
an
off
white
head
with
little
lace
it
had
an
aroma
of
malt
smoke
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
chocolate
the
body
was
creamy
and
the
finish
was
chocolate
with
some
smoke
present
really
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
on
draft
now
to
get
my
hands
on
that
african
foreign
extra
that
ive
heard
so
many
fables
about
beautiful
opaque
black
beer
with
a
dense
tan
head
rich
roasted
coffee
flavor
with
chocolate
coming
through
nice
carbonation
but
it
isnt
overdone
feels
good
all
the
way
down
to
your
stomach
the
only
thing
that
hampers
this
fine
brew
as
with
most
hearty
dry
stouts
in
my
opinion
is
the
flavor
seems
to
build
up
in
your
mouth
over
time
i
cant
drink
more
than
4
or
5
in
a
row
i
need
something
every
couple
of
bottles
to
shift
gears
like
a
crisp
pilsner
first
i
want
to
say
that
what
i
drank
was
from
canada
despite
the
same
packaging
it
is
not
the
same
stuff
from
ireland
i
was
disappointed
that
being
said
on
to
the
review
poured
dark
with
a
dark
head
considerable
lacing
taste
is
very
malty
with
any
hoppiness
not
easily
tasted
finish
is
smooth
i
am
very
sad
that
i
cant
get
the
original
black
stuff
you
could
almost
chew
it
before
the
days
of
microbrews
foreign
or
domestic
guinness
was
the
only
quality
stout
available
it
remains
quality
in
fact
stands
up
to
any
stout
new
or
old
the
tar
pitch
black
revives
fond
memories
full
bodied
and
truly
dry
and
smoky
yet
highly
drinkable
a
light
sweetness
mingles
well
with
the
medium
to
high
hop
content
the
beige
frothy
head
lasts
a
good
while
then
leaves
behind
a
sturdy
lace
reminder
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
that
is
until
later
as
this
warmed
a
bit
it
got
a
little
sassier
with
more
pronounced
flavors
as
long
as
this
particular
recipe
isnt
fiddled
with
ill
still
go
back
to
my
first
love
from
time
to
time
it
can
hold
its
own
against
fancy
micros
it
now
amazes
me
to
think
that
no
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
ago
this
was
the
strongest
beer
i
drank
at
that
time
it
seemed
so
thick
and
strong
tasting
and
even
the
abv
seemed
significant
tonight
is
the
first
time
ive
had
guinness
in
quite
a
while
and
im
surprised
how
thin
and
light
it
actually
is
since
i
been
drinking
much
stronger
beers
guinness
hardly
seems
stout
anymore
compared
to
most
stouts
or
doppelbocks
it
is
downright
tame
it
starts
off
nicely
pours
a
dark
almost
black
beer
with
a
nice
foamy
head
smell
is
pretty
good
also
guinness
still
tastes
good
but
the
body
is
so
light
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
glass
of
cola
it
is
a
little
bitter
and
dry
but
once
again
compared
to
something
like
shakespeare
stout
quite
tame
ill
drink
guinness
if
there
are
no
better
options
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
this
is
a
case
where
a
onetime
classic
brew
has
been
far
outclassed
by
some
of
the
newer
examples
of
the
style
drinkability
notes
this
is
not
the
guinness
extra
stout
i
grew
up
with
being
that
it
is
not
the
real
stuff
from
canada
in
the
us
it
does
not
surprise
me
but
still
it
is
disappointing
notes
moses
smell
the
roses
i
could
drink
this
all
damn
day
long
its
frighteningly
drinkable
and
could
get
you
in
a
lot
of
trouble
if
you
had
some
errands
to
accomplish
of
course
if
those
errands
happen
to
be
sitting
and
emptying
numerous
bottles
of
stoutthan
consider
them
done
this
is
the
one
against
which
all
others
are
measured
and
remains
a
constant
in
a
world
of
fads

its
the
ramones
of
stout
old
had
this
old
standard
for
the
first
time
in
ages
nice
deep
color
fantastic
head
retention
and
rings
of
chunky
lacing
sweetish
aroma
with
a
hint
of
burnt
toast
smooth
slightly
roasted
taste
with
some
sweetish
malty
undertones
creamy
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
o
k
a
comfortable
traditional
stout
but
a
bit
overated
in
my
eyes
this
is
my
first
guinness
in
about
23
years
and
it
will
not
be
my
last
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
almost
black
with
a
nice
thick
brown
head
that
took
quite
some
time
to
die
down
the
first
smell
that
hit
me
out
of
the
bottle
was
the
hops
followed
by
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
it
pretty
much
tasted
like
it
smelt
a
good
hoppy
bite
at
first
with
coffee
and
chocolate
undertones
as
you
swallow
it
down
the
mouthfeel
was
wonderful
with
just
the
right
amount
of
thickness
and
carbonation
the
last
guinness
i
had
was
the
draught
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
much
more
great
beer
notes
picked
up
this
pint
while
grocery
shopping
a
revisit
have
not
had
a
guinness
in
34
years
be
sure
to
stock
some
guinness
pours
and
looks
like
a
beer
marketers
dream
the
appearence
alone
could
sell
this
beer
its
as
dark
and
humourous
as
a
film
nior
with
a
mysterious
shape
shifting
head
that
slowly
lurks
back
into
the
beer
whence
it
came
creamy
and
bitter
sweet
then
dry
a
great
beer
for
a
red
meat
i
drank
this
next
to
5
other
guinness
offerings
including
the
7
5
fes
and
gse
for
jm
8
0
and
this
stood
up
well
to
both
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
the
criteria
were
for
a
beer
to
go
with
food
and
to
be
consumed
on
a
daily
basis
this
would
win
out
over
the
fes
and
gse
i
can
only
imagine
the
reviewers
giving
this
a
poor
rating
in
the
us
are
getting
a
different
brew
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
dissipates
into
a
nice
sticky
lace
nose
is
burnt
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
roasted
malts
and
bitter
dark
coffee
creamy
mouth
feel
with
a
very
dry
finish
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
really
special
when
you
consider
all
the
other
wonderful
stouts
out
there
smell
was
mostly
bitter
and
somewhat
coffee
like
not
very
pronounced
taste
was
faintly
bitter
dark
coffee
flavors
not
much
hop
presence
to
note
slick
and
nearly
syrupy
feel
just
a
touch
underdone
and
watery
finish
flavors
never
really
got
into
gear
i
was
expecting
more
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
really
so
many
more
great
stouts
to
choose
from
i
tried
this
out
in
a
pinch
im
not
too
big
of
a
fan
of
this
and
i
really
like
guinness
it
was
a
jet
balck
color
with
a
brown
head
to
it
the
taste
was
that
of
burnt
coffee
nothing
more
nothing
less
started
out
harsh
and
finished
out
harsh
ive
had
it
only
2
times
and
i
plan
on
not
getting
it
anymore
ill
stick
to
the
draught
very
low
on
my
drinkability
scale
this
has
a
wonderful
nearly
black
appearance
with
some
mild
hops
and
dark
chocolatecoffee
in
the
aroma
the
taste
imo
does
not
hold
up
to
draught
nor
does
the
mouthfeel
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
creamy
guinness
and
instead
got
a
carbonated
almost
spicy
liquid
passing
over
my
tongue
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
but
still
remains
pleasant
the
flavor
has
quite
a
burnt
side
to
it
like
i
am
drinking
liquified
burnt
toast
not
a
great
stout
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
i
would
think
it
would
pair
better
with
food
rather
than
on
its
own
guinness
extra
stout
after
so
many
years
of
drinking
guinness
draught
i
finally
remembered
to
try
one
of
these
it
was
excellent
with
substantially
more
head
carbonation
than
i
remembered
the
taste
was
very
well
balanced
without
the
dominating
malt
tastes
that
are
so
common
in
its
competitors
from
now
on
ill
leave
the
widget
cans
on
the
shelf
and
look
for
this
although
it
still
cant
beat
a
well
poured
guinness
pint
black
hue
opaque
with
a
tan
head
of
moderate
size
poor
head
retention
some
lace
the
nose
is
roasted
malts
and
earthiness
every
sip
is
noticeably
dry
it
begs
you
to
taste
it
again
and
you
gladly
do
the
flavors
are
magical
with
roasted
malt
nuts
and
perceptible
hops
damn
tasty
mouthfeel
is
moderate
this
is
what
guinness
is
all
about
it
is
a
classic
and
a
must
try
for
everyone
guinness
on
tap
is
one
of
a
kind
and
an
indispensible
experience
for
beerdrinkers
but
i
was
thrilled
to
discover
how
truly
enjoyable
the
extra
stout
is
an
exceptional
stout
with
sophistication
and
complexity
but
at
the
same
time
a
comforting
quality
and
drinkability
that
make
for
an
excellent
beer
to
have
around
all
the
time
deserves
in
be
in
heavy
rotation
in
your
fridge
for
starters
i
love
this
stuff
the
characteristics
are
distinctly
guinness
and
may
not
apply
elsewhere
thick

with
an
instant

dissipates

slightly

to
safely

the

eclipse
very
thick
mouth
feel
leaves
residue
on
the
palette
the
teeth
hell
everywherei
love
it
a
little
on
the
gritty
side
thats
why
they
put
a
filter
at
the
tap
initially
very
smooth
but
gives
way
to
a
stale
bitter
hop
faint
aroma
of
chocolate
overall
a
great
beer
but
drink
slowly
if
you
dont
like
darker
beers
dont
even
think
about
trying
this
oneyoull
hate
it
everything
about
this
beer
speaks
volumes
from
the
milky
white
head
to
the
darkness
of
the
body
i
good
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
or
just
to
sip
on
a
step
up
from
murphys
guinness
is
the
standard
for
stouts
if
you
cant
get
it
draught
dont
bother
and
dont
try
downing
it
it
is
not
a
downing
beer
it
will
come
back
up
on
you
treat
it
with
respect
while
guinness
ltd
feverishly
works
at
pushing
the
boundaries
of

guinness
extra
stout
quietly
goes
about
being
the
best
guinness
product
available
in
the
u
s
a
in
the
glass
it
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
with
a
thick
two
finger
head
that
ultimately
shrinks
to
14
inch
the
smell
is
mostly
molasses
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
breaking
through
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
dominate
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
and
espresso
just
a
bit
too
thin
for
a
stout
although
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
the
widget
versions
finish
is
clean
for
a
stout
and
dry
every
bit
as
ubiquitous
as
budmilcoors
probably
more
so
and
so
while
there
are
undoubtedly
better
craft
brew
stouts
this
is
a
good
choice
to
fall
back
on
when
macros
are
all
there
are

be
had

bad

not
good

surprisingly
guinness

is

pretty

close
but
not
quite
a
thin

drifts

pretty
nice

a
nice
roasted

bitterness
mixed
with
a

aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
hovering
right
around
medium
i
havent
had
a
guiness
in
a
while
and
i
had
forgotten
what
a
great
burnt
malt
bitterness
this
beer
has
thats
something
that
really
appeals
to
me
in
stouts
theres
also
a
nice
roasted
nut
character
black
coffee
comes
to
mind
as
well
great
lingering
bitterness
really
nice
tasting
stout
if
you
are
going
to
drink
guinness
this
is
the
one
to
get
although
i
have
not
had
the
chance
to
sample
the
foreign
extra
stout
aromas
of
roasted
seeds
caramel
and
smoke
very
rich
hard
fizz
very
burnt
coffee
beans
licorice
slightly
sour
dense
roasted
herb
root
flavors
clamp
down
immediately
after
the
mildly
sweet
beginning
these
are
tartly
bitter
and
leave
me
breathing
fumes
of
roasted
dirt
powerfully
lingering
minutes
later
i
smack
my
lips
and
am
assaulted
with
a
seethingly
bitter
sap
of
burning
wood
and
licorice
nice
pours
a
dark
brownblack
coffee
color
with
a
very
small
tan
head
even
though
i
saw
it
wasnt
coming
on
normal
and
poured
very
vigorously
the
last
half
of
the
pour
the
smell
is
a
faint
roasted
light
chocolate
smell
with
a
semisweet
malty
background
the
taste
right
from
the
start
is
a
very
crisp
light
bodied
bite
that
tapers
into
a
roasted
malt
with
a
twang
and
then
finishes
with
a
burnt
chocolate
and
slight
twang
mild
hops
hit
in
the
middle
very
light
bodied
for
a
stout
it
is
not
bad
but
its
not
great
sláinte
comparisons
to
the
other
versions
of
guinness
are
inevitable
so
i
wont
try
to
avoid
them
with
a
rousing
pour
the
extra
stout
can
look
almost
like
the
guinness
draught
poured
under
nitrogen
dispense
black
in
color
with
hard
to
find
ruby
highlights
and
a
very
thick
creamy
rocky
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
roasty
its
not
as
full
as
the
foreign
extra
but
offers
much
more
than
the
draught
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
is
gentle
giving
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
roasty
and
more
chocolatey
than
the
draught
the
sour
note
appears
much
softer
as
well
although
this
is
probably
because
this
bottle
was
contract
brewed
in
canada
it
has
a
solid
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
a
roasted
malt
bite
it
finishes
with
a
long
dry
bitterness
i
prefer
this
version
to
the
others
the
draught
is
too
limited
in
character
for
my
tastes
and
the
foreign
extra
is
too
full
and
rich
for
most
occassions
very
nice
but
still
dont
get
me
wrong
its
guinness
and
therefore
almost
deductively
a
good
beer
its
a
classic
and
a
deserving
one
though
there
are
almost
certainly
more
drinkable
and
interestingly
complex
stouts
on
the
market
it
is
almost
black
with
a
very
thick
head
which
leaves
a
nice
lace
great
apperance
it
is
a
very
dry
beer
with
an
intense
roasted
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
and
flavor
are
both
wonderful
drinking
this
is
a
joy
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
sticky
creamy
tan
head
on
the
nose
there
are
aromas
of
malt
and
caramel
notes
on
the
palate
rich
malt
flavors
come
through
caramel
dark
fruit
slight
coffee
taste
nice
malt
sweetness
slight
hop
tanginess
and
dry
in
the
finish
really
enjoyable
stout
a
classic
lovely
yummy
and
drinkable
what
else
can
you
say
about
guinness
extra
a
roasty
creamy
delight
thats
widely
available
and
wont
break
the
bank
a
classic
that
still
sets
the
standard
more
wholesome
than
the
nitro
injected
guinesses
of
the
world
the
flavour
seems
a
shade
more
full
and
the
finish
is
earthier
and
stronger
as
well
give
the
old
school
a
shot
dig
it
cheers
pours
with
big
full
head
dont
get
much
of
the
show
with
a
bottle
this
is
best
served
as
nitro
draught
nonetheless
smooth
and
mellow
malt
aroma
such
a
nice
texture
to
the
drink
rich
and
full
yet
smooth
and
tastey
my
sibs
refer
to
this
as
the
true
king
of
beers
while
i
dont
consider
this
my
favorite
beer
or
even
my
favorite
stout
it
could
certainly
supplant
the
self
proclaimed
beer
of
that
title
without
hesitation
the
first
stout
i
ever
tried
and
it
will
always
have
a
spot
reserved
in
my
refrigerator
its
the
only
good
beer
available
in
most
of
the
bars
where
i
live
id
still
prefer
a
guinnes
draught
but
this
beats
the
nitro
cans
or
shudder
draught
bottles
dont
expect
the
creamy
stuff
you
find
on
draught
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
the
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
hops
the
extra
stout
ive
been
getting
lately
is
brewed
in
canada
but
it
seems
to
be
brewed
in
the
st
james
gate
tradition
appealing
very
thick
creamy
rocky
beige
head
certainly
entices
the
palette
clear
ultra
dark
red
hue
can
be
perceived
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
however
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
a
sharp
nearly
astringent
black
patent
aroma
dominates
and
theres
not
much
else
there
medium
bodied
with
a
large
dose
of
roasted
grain
bitterness
and
hop
bitterness
much
bolder
in
roasted
barley
flavor
than
the
canned
or
even
draught
guinness
ive
had
this
brew
just
needs
more
balance
is
it
a
dry
stout
or
a
style
thats
more
assertive
the
mild
astringency
does
detract
from
overall
enjoyment
i
enjoy
balance
in
my
stouts
and
this
one
falls
short
mine
was
the
irish
version
thick
rich
roasty
tasty
and
just
plain
great
wouldnt
drink
it
as
session
beer
but
one
at
the
end
of
the
night
is
always
good
this
is
one
damn
fine
stout
i
dont
know
that
i
would
neccessarily
put
it
above
guinness
draught
they
are
completely
different
beers
both
are
excellent
however
this
was
the
only
thing
that
got
me
through
my
brothers
wedding
a
nightmare
of
american
macros
great
wedding
though
pours
a
nice
black
with
an
off
white
sticky
head
roasted
malt
coffee
and
burnt
chocolate
in
the
nose
great
balance
between
the
bitterness
and
the
sweetness
of
the
chocolate
slick
and
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
one
of
my
first
choices
if
i
have
to
downgrade
from
draft
beer
at
a
bar
with
a
poor
selection
i
walk
into
the
little
market
by
my
house
to
pick
up
some
milk
and
lo
and
behold
in
the
cooler
they
are
stocking
bottles
of
this
stuff
st
patricks
day
must
be
coming
up
eh
this
store
caters
to
the
busch
and
miller
high
life
crowd
so
seeing
guinness
extra
stout
was
surprising
the
cashier
rang
it
up
looked
at
me
and
said
is
this
beer
i
assured
her
it
was
she
needed
to
know
to
hit
the
beer
key
on
the
cash
register
i
give
this
perfect
marks
for
appearance
no
it
doesnt
give
the
show
the
nitro
can
or
draft
do
but
it
looks
incredible
in
the
glass
with
a
brown
candylike
foam
head
and
pitch
blackness
staring
from
the
pint
glass
nice
roasted
malt
taste
light
hop
twang
and
overall
a
bit
more
warming
than
regular
guinness
good
stuff
fwiw
this
was
brewed
in
st
james
gate
not
by
labatt
in
canada
bittercoffee
dominates
robust
and
grainy
character
a
little
too
heavy
duty
and
oily
to
my
tongue
but
its
a
classic
and
travels
well
though
these
days
imported
means
from
canada
its
still
my
test
standard
for
evaluating
the
dry
stout
style
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
always
good
as
a
fall
back
rich
smelling
bouquet
of
mildly
roasted
malt
and
a
sharp
wild
hops
black
as
any
other
guiness
dont
get
that
beautiful
cascade
effect
like
the
draft
or
nitro
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
beer
semisweet
mild
bitterness
that
sticks
on
your
palate
stronger
than
your
regular
guinness
and
because
they
give
me
more
of
what
im
seeking
i
like
this
even
better
pitch
black
appearance
not
nearly
as
creamy
and
milkytextured
as
i
would
have
liked
way
too
bitter
for
me
just
didnt
care
for
it
at
all
was
a
little
more
enjoyable
when
it
warmed
up
guinness
ontap
imho
is
so
much
better
i
do
not
know
but
looking
at
everyone
elses
review
maybe
i
havent
come
across
a
good
bottle
yet
here
in
town
alot
more
flavour
in
it
than
in
the
regular
guiness
draught
in
the
can
really
good
stuff
an
exceptional
stout
silky
smooth
rich
malt
chococlate
coffee
outstanding
my
bottles
were
from
st
james
gate
and
were
no
less
than
four
years
old
if
anything
the
taste
mellowed
a
bit
with
the
age
this
is
classic
beer
here
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
the
12oz
are
from
canada
but
the
16oz
is
really
from
ireland
my
wife
and
i
did
a
tasting
of
the
pub
draft
can
which
was
thin
and
watery
extra
stout
12oz
canadian
great
flavor
but
a
little
thin
then
the
extra
stout
16oz
irish
very
tasty
and
creamyer
than
the
12oz
with
a
little
more
body
but
nothing
beats
the
extra
stout
on
nitro
tap
after
ignoring
this
stout
for
a
while
in
favor
of
heavier
bodied
fairly
sweet
english
style
stouts
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
guinness
as
others
have
said
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
than
this
venerable
classic
but
few
can
rival
its
easy
drinkability
a
true
classic
not
the
best
but
not
far
from
it
rich
creamy
and
very
satisfying
i
have
to
admit
that
ive
never
had
it
room
temp
in
a
pub
unfortunately
this
listing
is
for
the
bottled
version
of
guinness
those
that
know
buy
the
cans
still
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
around
no
matter
what
its
served
in
in
cans
rating
goes
to
straight
5s
from
tap
in
dublin
rating
goes
to
6s
notes
this
is
the
real
guinness
in
my
opinion
known
and
labeled
as
their
original
and
actually
what
can
i
say
i
love
a
guinness
everything
about
it
just
works
my
goto
not
the
best
but
certainly
not
the
worst
this
has
always
been
my
cant
go
wrong
beer
it
is
a
nice
shuttle
dark
beer
with
the
right
thickness
and
darkness
for
my
taste
first
stout
of
any
kind
id
ever
tried
like
most
people
i
suppose
still
drink
it
from
time
to
time
when
i
need
a
smooth
drinking
dark
beer
all
around
good
dry
stout
you
know
that
though
always
reliable
delicious
and
light
goes
down
as
smooth
as
can
be
classic
stout
always
my
default
smooth
creamy
taste
delicious
strong
flavour
very
smooth
and
thick
a
classic
basis
for
the
dry
stout
style
full
of
taste
and
texture
the
definition
of
dry
irish
stouts
from
a
draught
can
pours
a
dark
black
with
the
typical
guinness
cascade
from
milk
chocolate
to
black
and
cream
tan
head
aroma
is
faint
but
has
slight
roast
taste
is
bittersweet
chocolate
and
light
roast
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
being
a
mass
produced
approachable
stout
my
single
favorite
beer
ever
keep
it
classic
its
a
great
beer
that
grows
on
you
in
texture
taste
and
looks
although
im
more
of
an
ipa
guy
this
will
remain
one
of
my
favorites
best
when
enjoyed
fresh
in
dublin
great
beer
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
build
up
the
courage
to
try
this
beer
tried
it
for
the
first
time
at
bible
study
a
few
weeks
ago
my
faith
has
indeed
been
restored
the
best
commercially
available
beer
one
of
my
favorites
a
classic
guiness
is
flat
out
a
great
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
just
bursts
with
flavor
refreshing
and
drinkable
for
any
occasion
poured
from
a
can
into
a
16
oz
pint
glass
dark
deep
amberebony
color
with
a
smooth
thick
head
smells
of
malt
tastes
of
roasted
malt
at
first
slight
bitter
tinge
of
baking
chocolate
watery
but
clean
finish
with
notes
of
coffee
light
watery
mouthfeel
though
thick
foam
head
adds
some
creamy
texture
inoffensive
pleasant
session
stout
and
balanced
best
enjoyed
on
tap
of
course
a
pub
classic
with
high
nostalgia
points
the
first
pint
i
ever
drank
was
this
in
galway
city
age
fourteen
its
guinness
the
beer
that
got
me
into
stouts
and
changed
my
beer
game
forever
the
hell
with
crap
ipa
and
the
bud
lights
of
the
world
browns
porters
and
stouts
are
where
its
at
hail
guinness
for
quality
and
flavor
and
hail
nitro
stouts
mothersmilk
one
of
the
greats
very
heavy
rich
and
creamy
but
not
my
type
i
still
can
find
it
enjoyable
on
some
occasions
though
feel
like
this
beer
will
clearly
have
advocates
and
critics
easily
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
looks
beautiful
with
a
nice
thick
head
and
dark
coloration
smells
great
too
the
taste
is
a
little
watery
but
it
still
tastes
strongly
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
reminds
me
of
an
iced
mocha
goes
down
very
smooth
a
classic
smooth
and
unique
dry
irish
stout
perfect
all
day
drinking
beer
pasturizing
allows
for
no
gas
bubbles
and
easy
drinking
overall
this
beer
would
have
rated
higher
if
not
for
the
watery
taste
it
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
just
does
not
quite
hit
the
mark
still
a
very
good
stout
i
like
a
more
subtle
tasting
stout
i
would
have
this
again
no
problem
still
and
always
the
best
draught
pour
in
a
branded
glass
in
my
local
village
pub
by
a
bartender
rated
1st
in
the
county
and
3rd
overall
in
the
guinness
central
florida
pouroff
2
years
running
appearance
is
outstanding
with
a
almost
black
body
and
creamy
head
that
lasts
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
with
cascading
bubbles
until
it
settles
down
and
she
serves
it
the
aroma
of
sweet
malt
roasted
coffee
and
lastly
the
bitterness
is
perfect
the
taste
is
a
blend
of
tart
and
bitter
with
a
smokey
flavor
i
like
burntsmokey
alcoholic
drinks
the
feel
is
a
rich
cream
giving
way
to
a
somewhat
lighter
than
expected
ending
overall
a
stout
you
can
keep
on
drinking
anyway
it
looked
fabulous
as
always
the
billowy
silky
smooth
dark
tan
foam
retained
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
black
and
refuses
any
light
to
pass
through
it
smells
carbonic
and
minerally
which
sadly
covered
up
any
beer
aroma
for
me
nitro
beers
it
tasted
better
than
i
remember
the
silky
creaminess
balanced
nicely
with
the
slightly
bitter
charred
wood
of
the
brew
with
espresso
undertones
the
deep
burnt
roast
lingers
long
and
very
mildly
sweet
i
liked
the
rich
creaminess
the
lively
epravescance
keeps
the
creaminess
at
bay
and
keeps
it
from
feeling
like
a
milkshake
this
beer
was
far
better
than
i
remember
ive
sampled
hundreds
of
other
beers
since
the
last
its
a
good
solid
beer
maybe
6075
percentile
its
a
good
option
at
those
crummy
5
beer
restaurants
that
only
serve
this
a
macro
beer
macro
beer
light
a
heffe
and
a
bad
pale
well
its
st
patricks
day
and
i
would
have
preferred
an
extra
stout
or
foreign
extra
but
a
can
of
guinness
draught
will
do
it
opens
with
a
pop
and
a
strange
squeal
from
the
hidden
nitro
widget
it
resembles
coffee
with
cream
as
it
pours
in
to
the
trademark
guinness
perfect
pint
glass
theres
a
beautiful
cascade
effect
as
the
darker
suds
fight
their
way
to
the
bottom
whats
left
when
its
all
said
and
done
is
a
picture
perfect
pint
deep
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
ruby
highlights
where
the
light
hits
the
base
of
the
glass
just
right
the
head
is
a
solid
inch
of
custard
like
foam
so
densely
packed
that
only
a
close
examination
reveals
the
miniscule
bubbles
dip
your
finger
in
to
it
and
the
impression
remains
like
icing
on
a
cake
guinness
draught
definitely
has
the
look
down
perhaps
one
of
the
most
appealing
appearances
of
any
beer
out
there
the
aroma
brings
faint
chocolate
malts
black
coffee
and
a
little
sourness
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
the
roasted
bitterness
that
is
sure
to
come
out
in
the
flavor
mild
yet
characteristic
of
a
dry
irish
stout
the
taste
brings
a
bit
of
tartness
married
with
a
nice
bittering
ash
that
creates
a
smoky
mild
flavor
lingering
roast
dominates
the
finish
fairly
simple
yet
nuanced
certainly
on
the
thin
easy
side
of
the
spectrum
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
rich
in
the
beginning
and
then
thin
and
watery
as
the
nitro
loses
steam
personally
i
think
it
loses
something
in
the
draught
flow
cans
its
a
novel
concept
that
brings
it
to
your
fridge
but
no
substitute
for
the
real
draught
guinness
on
tap
that
said
its
still
a
great
example
of
the
style
simple
uncomplicated
accessible
a
great
beer
to
broaden
your
horizons
with
i
dont
get
why
people
drink
this
so
much
o
overrated
but
its
okay
overall
its
an
okay
stout
however
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
i
love
this
beer
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
fantastic
with
rich
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
all
of
this
comes
together
great
i
just
feel
like
it
should
be
a
little
thicker
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
a
lot
stronger
and
have
a
more
robust
taste
however
it
want
bad
and
ill
drink
it
tonight
to
pay
homage
to
st
patricks
day
had
to
score
this
one
lower
it
looks
pretty
impressive
with
a
lava
lamp
type
of
current
and
a
constant
12
finger
froth
but
i
was
expecting
a
more
flavorful
and
thicker
beer
but
it
was
so
airy
that
it
didnt
feel
like
i
was
drinking
anything
extremely
thick
but
i
think
its
pretty
decent
i
only
drink
it
on
special
occasions
though
shes
a
beauty
to
look
at
for
sure
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
stout
with
a
very
light
almost
airy
mouthfeel
compared
to
other
stouts
at
this
point
i
accept
guinness
for
what
it
isa
very
well
made
and
enjoyable
beer
that
just
doesnt
have
much
going
on
in
the
aroma
and
taste
departments
overall
very
accessible
classical
craft
great
balance
in
flavors
and
well
intensified
with
good
freshness
a
classic
love
the
look
feel
and
taste
an
always
enjoyable
sessionable
stout
thin
for
the
style
though
taste
isnt
bad
but
its
thin
like
water
its
so
awkward
to
drink
cause
you
taste
the
totasted
coffee
flavors
but
the
mouthfeel
is
awful
but
im
in
pa
where
the
bartender
prbably
didnt
pour
a
proper
guinness
very
good
beeronly
had
it
in
a
black
and
tan
very
creamy
feelhave
to
try
it
by
itself
soon
it
is
everything
we
ask
for
every
sip
i
loved
this
beer
before
i
started
drinking
stouts
now
it
serves
as
a
goto
when
there
are
no
better
options
on
draft
its
gorgeous
to
look
at
however
i
love
guinness
i
know
it
isnt
exciting
complex
interesting
or
even
amazingly
delicious
especially
compared
to
so
many
of
the
incredible
beers
that
are
brewed
today
but
i
love
it
all
the
same
maybe
its
just
the
experience
that
comes
with
each
glorious
pint
that
i
enjoy
so
much
sitting
down
in
a
laidback
pub
with
friends
grinning
like
an
idiot
just
enjoying
myself
for
me
guinness
fills
that
perfect
little
niche
between
the
crappy
bigbrand
beers
that
you
can
mindlessly
chug
one
after
another
and
the
stupidgood
craft
brews
that
will
put
you
on
your
ass
after
just
a
few
this
stout
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
roasted
flavor
to
it
i
judge
other
stouts
based
on
guinness
and
only
a
few
of
them
have
met
the
same
level
for
me
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
have
after
a
long
day
of
skiing
next
to
a
fireplace
looks
fine
in
the
glass
but
has
minimal
taste
and
feels
like
drinking
water
very
thin
there
are
better
things
from
guinness
never
been
a
fan
not
enough
taste
given
how
heavy
it
is
33
draft
chicago
houlihans
dark
pour
with
minimal
texture
or
aroma
very
smooth
pour
light
taste
and
abv
was
a
regular
consumer
as
a
teen
young
adult
but
moved
on
to
stronger
beers
with
a
better
taste
but
i
think
that
is
admirable
as
it
makes
it
a
go
to
when
there
is
nothing
else
to
choose
from
besides
a
light
beer
or
something
therefore
i
can
see
why
it
is
definitely
a
classic
in
the
same
sense
that
bass
ale
is
a
classic
along
with
sam
adams
lager
and
sierra
nevada
pale
being
new
classics
maybe
its
better
in
ireland
i
like
the
stout
much
better
i
will
not
buy
it
again
guinness
is
the
beer
that
breaks
you
in
to
a
stout
its
also
the
go
to
beer
when
the
bar
has
not
much
to
offer
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
on
the
weak
side
4
2
but
it
remains
a
classic
overly
filling
and
bland
looks
really
cool
with
the
layering
and
nitro
pour
but
disappoints
the
taste
buds
when
i
had
my
first
pint
of
guinness
i
was
18
and
drinking
in
a
pub
near
the
tower
of
london
the
barkeep
smiled
and
assured
me
its
like
black
milk
lad
this
is
true
comfort
beer
lovely
to
look
at
smooth
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
a
true
experience
as
my
palate
has
become
more
seasoned
ive
found
other
beers
more
complex
and
tasty
for
me
drinking
guinness
is
like
remembering
your
first
kiss
its
magic
overall
a
classic
good
beer
nice
pour
not
an
easy
drinker
oi
am
not
one
to
rag
on
the
other
guinness
varieties
e
g
the
extra
is
pretty
decent
but
this
version
is
a
letdown
the
look
is
right
but
i
could
not
get
over
the
watery
aspects
of
this
beerit
smells
watery
it
tastes
watery
and
it
feels
watery
oh
well
my
favorite
looking
beer
love
that
head
i
know
this
is
going
to
sound
odd
but
it
taste
better
in
ireland
than
it
does
is
the
united
states
its
an
institution
what
can
i
say
that
hasnt
been
said
before
both
or
if
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looked
this
would
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
poured
this
into
a
guinness
glass
this
one
receives
high
marks
with
regards
to
appearance
and
smell
its
essentially
black
with
a
really
nice
off
white
creamy
head
and
smells
of
coffee
with
traces
of
chocolate
taste
and
feel
is
a
little
lackluster
in
my
opinion
its
a
little
too
light
bodied
for
my
taste
but
the
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavors
are
pretty
tasty
amazing
beer
great
taste
and
goes
down
smooth
love
it
the
standard
by
which
all
other
irish
brews
are
measured
dry
creamy
feel
subtle
roasted
malt
aroma
predominately
pitch
black
but
has
some
brown
around
the
edge
faint
chalky
feel
rich
tan
head
that
leaves
a
handsome
film
on
the
glass
i
cant
detect
any
negative
characteristics
clean
finish
with
a
mild
tingle
of
sweetness
occasionally
tap
guinness
has
a
bit
of
chocolate
with
coffee
aftertaste
so
many
flavors
going
on
very
smooth
and
nice
very
nice
stout
on
tap
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
out
of
a
bottle
not
so
much
love
it
just
rarely
drink
it
if
you
want
to
get
into
the
stout
heres
your
beer
just
make
sure
to
let
it
warm
up
a
little
bit
before
drinking
it
has
its
place
smooth
with
a
good
finish
not
nearly
as
potent
as
it
appears
not
a
terrible
brew
by
any
means
a
very
good
go
to
if
you
dont
have
a
decent
selection
on
hand
still
my
favorite
of
all
the
stouts
not
the
best
stout
but
suitable
in
a
pinch
the
budweiser
of
stouts
black
water
this
is
one
of
those
beers
either
you
like
it
or
you
dont
i
love
it
very
nice
taste
you
can
really
savor
the
flavor
especially
when
its
from
the
tap
goes
great
with
food
too
cheers
this
is
a
great
goto
beer
and
is
always
in
my
fridge
what
i
like
is
that
although
it
is
a
dark
beer
and
very
smoky
it
is
also
very
refreshing
i
could
never
turn
down
a
guinness
goes
well
with
seafood
as
well
as
steaks
and
stews
also
great
to
cook
with
it
makes
stews
a
lot
richer
smokier
and
toastier
yesterday
i
made
some
chicken
étouffée
and
added
a
can
of
the
black
stuff
and
came
out
fantastic
cheers
fellas
i
just
cant
get
into
heavy
dark
beers
very
overrated
beer
it
is
very
popular
pricy
but
still
famous
and
beloved
in
russia
fine
but
not
extraordinary
watered
down
session
stout
served
cold
on
nitro
it
took
a
few
pints
of
this
thick
rick
heavy
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
could
hardly
drink
it
keep
in
mind
my
beer
of
choice
then
was
coors
light
it
is
a
drastic
difference
from
an
american
lager
to
the
stout
beer
awesome
beer
to
make
the
transition
from
lagers
and
and
such
not
a
big
fan
of
dark
stout
beers
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
will
be
drinking
more
easy
drinking
stout
thats
reminiscent
of
chocolate
milk
but
too
watery
for
my
taste
its
guinness
extra
diluted
but
with
some
of
the
nice
guinness
characteristics
best
beer
ever
the
best
classic
beer
best
enjoyed
on
tap
at
an
irish
pub
or
festival
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
heavy
but
amazing
i
personally
love
the
color
strong
taste
that
goes
great
along
with
foods
my
favorite
beer
at
the
moment
black
creamy
goodness
absolutely
requires
knowledgeable
bar
staff
and
correct
setup
to
be
enjoyed
to
its
maximum
guinness
draught
my
go
to
beer
before
the
craft
scene
took
off
its
the
stout
of
which
all
other
stouts
are
based
off
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
and
a
fairly
light
body
and
light
carbonation
that
goes
down
smooth
a
perfect
session
beer
that
is
best
served
on
a
nitrogen
tap
the
original
love
from
my
youth
went
back
to
it
at
joes
crab
shack
as
its
been
years
since
i
have
had
one
not
near
as
bold
and
thick
as
i
remember
still
pours
beautiful
with
a
promising
creamy
malty
smell
but
thats
where
it
stops
taste
is
very
mild
actually
smoother
and
less
bold
than
a
american
adjacent
lager
and
about
as
filling
dont
let
the
black
color
fool
you
its
a
very
smooth
and
mild
brew
its
like
drinking
chocolate
milk
dark
beer
standard
very
malty
rich
and
filling
bitter
finish
i
cant
drink
more
than
one
one
of
my
favorite
beers
all
of
my
friends
are
obsessed
with
this
beer
and
to
be
honest
it
was
a
good
beer
not
a
great
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
ill
have
another
next
winter
when
the
snow
is
piling
up
and
i
need
something
heavy
and
warming
overall
not
a
bad
taste
a
lot
lighter
than
i
expected
for
a
guiness
id
drink
it
again
maybe
cliched
to
love
this
beer
but
it
has
become
the
ultimate
standard
fur
me
beautiful
fragrant
delicious
first
stout
every
and
that
lead
to
a
long
relationship
with
that
beer
type
lol
11
2
oz
bottle
from
trader
joes
pours
dark
brown
turns
black
light
tan
to
almost
eggshell
white
head
nose
of
mild
yeast
and
malt
taste
of
mild
caramel
roastiness
slightly
grassy
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
its
dry
and
light
tasty
for
what
is
essentially
a
light
beer
always
a
decent
go
to
at
a
local
fish
fry
i
had
my
first
guinness
in
a
while
i
forgot
how
little
taste
it
has
i
love
guinness
when
pored
well
from
a
good
pub
there
has
never
been
a
more
complete
beer
the
cascading
is
beautiful
as
the
beer
settles
it
has
a
full
flavor
and
a
really
smooth
texture
i
have
tried
a
lot
of
other
very
good
portersstouts
but
guinness
is
the
best
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
when
you
get
a
pint
that
has
been
poured
correctly
sadly
you
dont
get
anywhere
near
the
same
experience
if
you
buy
it
bottled
and
many
pubs
in
the
states
dont
bother
to
pour
it
correctly
theres
nothing
wrong
with
a
classic
the
draw
to
guinness
is
not
its
complexity
or
intensity
but
its
smooth
mouthfeel
its
consistent
malt
flavor
and
the
classicness
of
guinness
and
its
legacy
some
beers
will
come
and
go
but
guinness
will
always
be
around
and
theres
something
to
be
said
for
that
by
far
my
favorite
beer
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
not
filling
as
a
lot
of
lagers
are
i
cant
believe
this
isnt
considered
the
best
beer
in
the
world
with
a
score
of
80
around
here
my
favorite
dark
beer
wish
i
had
a
dollar
for
every
pint
ive
put
down
just
classic
irish
dry
stout
love
it
its
a
classic
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
from
the
can
its
okay
definitely
not
the
same
as
draft
but
i
am
no
expert
still
learning
overall
it
is
still
a
great
beer
to
have
from
draft
is
the
best
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
really
good
tasting
stout
one
of
my
favorites
to
think
this
is
probably
the
all
time
best
selling
dark
beer
is
hard
to
understand
i
just
tried
it
again
the
other
day
from
a
tavern
that
pours
a
ton
of
it
every
day
its
okay
but
nothing
special
compared
to
some
of
the
great
porters
and
stouts
that
are
on
the
market
now
best
from
tap
if
poured
correctly
black
with
a
smooth
creamy
head
hints
of
coffee
chocolates
and
caramel
from
tap
black
opaque
with
low
creamy
hard
head
aroma
with
notes
of
caramel
coffee
bread
and
herbs
taste
is
full
and
semi
dry
i
ended
up
having
this
in
a
can
i
didnt
realize
you
were
suppose
to
let
it
sit
even
with
that
it
wasnt
very
great
ive
had
better
this
is
my
first
review
and
i
thought
id
start
with
a
beer
i
really
enjoy
i
guess
im
an
outlier
on
this
one
but
i
really
love
this
stout
overall
its
a
classic
if
im
not
drinking
some
new
crazy
hoppy
craft
beer
i
kind
of
enjoy
having
the
guinness
to
fall
back
on
its
one
of
the
few
massproduced
beers
that
i
feel
no
guilt
in
drinking
great
beer
3
75
overall
it
is
the
greatest
beer
in
all
the
world
sometimes
you
gotta
have
a
guinness
once
the
dark
beer
when
there
were
no
others
its
now
a
little
mild
comparatively
still
the
classic
taste
make
sure
the
bartender
pours
it
correctly
stouts
are
my
favorite
will
never
forget
my
first
experience
it
was
bad
but
now
i
love
it
i
think
it
was
skunky
this
is
my
favorite
stout
of
all
time
even
after
i
tell
myself
that
i
can
drink
no
more
beer
i
always
have
room
for
a
guinness
cause
its
desert
what
can
be
said
its
guinness
for
christs
sake
love
the
cascade
and
smooth
taste
overall
a
reasonably
priced
macro
which
i
intend
on
buying
again
i
know
people
say
that
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
them
but
this
is
and
probably
will
always
remain
one
of
my
favorite
beers
just
a
classic
velvet
black
candy
a
perfect
beer
mass
produced
for
your
pleasure
smooth
high
drinkability
nice
notes
of
caramel
and
chocolate
and
coffee
obviously
one
f
the
classics
with
its
unique
almost
indiscernible
flavor
that
can
only
come
from
the
hard
waters
of
dublin
an
excellent
chaser
depending
on
the
environment
if
someone
was
to
force
me
to
drink
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
be
the
one
great
smooth
high
drinkability
nice
notes
of
caramel
and
chocolate
one
of
my
favorite
macro
beers
a
classic
pours
black
its
actually
a
dark
shade
of
red
hold
it
in
the
light
beautiful
white
foam
head
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
like
velvet
taste
is
like
a
creamy
coffee
but
more
bitter
and
fluffy
everyone
should
try
one
at
some
point
cheers
love
it
hands
down
a
staple
and
constant
cant
go
wrong
beer
i
dont
understand
the
point
in
the
idea
of
a
non
carbonated
brew
dont
get
me
wrong
i
am
all
for
the
unconventional
product
but
this
one
was
not
for
me
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
but
not
good
great
flavor
though
thin
wish
it
had
more
chew
but
ill
never
turn
down
a
guiness
one
of
my
favorites
how
beer
should
taste
smell
feel
and
look
smooth
and
silky
mouth
taste
slight
pleasant
bitterness
good
stout
you
can
find
everywhere
hard
to
beat
the
classic
always
true
overall
i
do
like
guinness
but
it
is
a
little
too
coffee
for
my
taste
that
doesnt
mean
it
isnt
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
every
now
and
then
and
it
is
now
a
very
reasonable
price
also
at
au53
a
case
of
24
x
440ml
cans
all
in
all
im
more
of
a
kilkenny
fan
damn
it
i
like
guinness
draught
i
know
it
doesnt
get
the
best
rap
here
but
its
so
damn
sessionable
the
nitro
effect
with
the
everlasting
snow
white
head
pitch
black
beer
priceless
guinness
on
tap
is
the
best
poured
slow
in
boston
or
ireland
o
beautiful
looking
tastes
good
and
the
nitro
creaminess
is
a
big
plus
the
original
stout
cant
hate
too
much
on
guinness
it
got
me
into
the
stouts
and
porters
i
enjoy
so
much
today
very
light
taste
faint
coffee
flavor
but
still
enjoyable
so
good
best
of
the
best
the
true
king
of
beers
this
is
my
favorite
mass
produced
beer
you
just
cant
beat
the
combined
sensations
of
its
color
taste
head
and
body
especially
when
poured
properly
love
it
my
goto
favorite
always
a
refreshing
stout
especially
when
properly
poured
it
definitively
tastes
better
in
ireland
solid
irish
dry
stout
seems
to
taste
a
little
better
in
ireland
cant
say
for
certain
that
its
made
differently
over
there
but
who
knows
the
best
beer
that
i
drink
daily
never
gets
old
all
around
amazing
beer
the
color
look
and
taste
is
all
phenomenal
you
cant
beat
a
guinness
draught
used
to
enjoy
guinness
ventured
away
into
other
stouts
for
awhile
came
back
and
now
seems
quite
boring
guinness
draught
35
overall
guiness
is
of
course
a
classic
and
was
my
first
non
bmc
beer
like
it
is
for
many
americans
however
there
are
so
many
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
now
with
more
depth
and
flavor
especially
as
irelands
craft
beer
industry
grows
more
and
more
the
beer
that
introduced
me
to
irish
draughts
i
bought
this
recently
in
the
guinness
variety
pack
poured
in
glass
good
beer
lots
of
flavors
and
a
nice
discolored
head
that
stays
until
you
are
finished
earthy
and
roasty
as
well
as
maltswellbalanced
smooth
and
a
very
dark
but
not
completely
dark
color
alot
of
flavors
going
on
here
this
is
an
iconic
beer
that
is
just
simply
well
made
if
you
havent
tried
guinness
you
should
give
it
a
try
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
enjoy
it
cheers
taste
creamy
roasted
malts
it
really
tastes
like
a
lot
out
there
and
honestly
more
watery
than
some
other
craft
breweries
are
doing
with
the
style
especially
nitro
beers
but
this
truly
is
a
classic
it
gets
points
for
that
and
was
the
best
beer
i
had
ever
drank
the
first
time
i
had
tried
it
after
years
of
drinking
macro
lager
swill
my
dad
helped
me
get
a
taste
for
this
amazing
stout
if
youre
new
to
darker
beers
it
may
be
rough
going
at
first
but
a
couple
of
glasses
or
bottles
in
your
palate
will
adjust
that
said
its
not
the
kind
of
beer
you
wanna
rush
through
at
a
frat
party
its
a
beer
for
relaxing
on
a
day
off
and
not
rushing
a
damn
thing
may
go
to
my
standard
i
have
a
bit
of
a
bias
towards
guinness
being
one
of
my
favorite
beers
wether
on
tap
in
nitro
can
or
bottle
poured
into
guinness
glass
cascades
into
finger
of
head
fluffy
like
a
marshmallow
thick
and
heavy
black
body
very
good
lacing
thick
head
to
get
past
into
watery
mouthfeel
but
slick
taste
is
roasty
malt
subtle
yeast
one
of
my
favorite
beers
absolutely
delicious
i
thoroughly
enjoy
the
creamy
head
and
the
general
smoothness
of
the
beer
tastes
as
good
out
of
a
widget
can
as
it
does
off
of
draught
out
of
a
bottle
some
of
the
general
character
is
lost
tastes
a
little
crisper
sharper
but
is
still
good
served
in
a
glass
from
the
widget
can
favorite
beer
of
all
time
nothing
better
then
after
a
long
hard
week
cleaning
up
and
drinking
a
fresh
poured
pint
of
black
far
too
heavy
for
me
to
drink
all
night
socially
love
the
hints
of
coffee
and
carmel
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
if
you
like
stout
but
want
something
that
is
not
too
heavy
aka
you
want
to
drink
multiple
it
is
also
good
because
it
is
the
only
stout
that
normally
remains
on
tap
at
least
in
canada
a
great
tasting
stout
but
saying
that
there
are
plenty
of
other
stouts
that
can
surpass
it
in
both
flavour
and
texture
it
all
depends
on
the
bar
in
which
the
pint
was
served
to
be
honest
as
the
pipes
that
supply
the
draught
have
to
be
cleaned
on
a
daily
basis
watery
widget
is
cool
though
i
think
everybody
knows
what
guinness
is
i
can
enjoy
this
beer
by
the
pint
it
has
a
good
taste
and
a
great
drinkability
a
meal
in
a
can
as
they
say
a
good
dry
stout
typical
of
the
style
but
so
many
small
craft
brewers
have
made
improvements
on
this
original
yes
its
got
the
history
and
the
name
and
its
fine
if
thats
what
is
available
but
you
can
probably
do
better
with
just
a
little
more
effort
overall
great
tasting
stout
quite
rich
and
filling
enjoyable
beer
which
i
fell
in
love
with
the
first
time
i
tried
it
while
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
stout
is
an
alltime
classic
we
still
need
to
be
judgmental
and
honest
went
rating
it
this
filling
yet
watery
stout
has
a
toasty
almost
burnt
flavor
that
is
perfect
for
sipping
but
if
you
are
planning
to
have
more
than
two
pints
you
might
want
to
go
in
another
direction
very
thin
and
watery
served
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
please
stick
to
foreign
or
foreign
extra
stouts
if
you
want
to
get
a
richer
taste
of
guinness
boring
and
watery
maybe
id
like
it
more
if
i
was
chugging
it
at
a
bar
already
drunk
or
something
but
just
having
it
on
its
own
at
home
is
unsatisfying
ill
just
pay
a
bit
more
for
the
foreign
extra
stout
next
time
my
favorite
overall
not
mush
to
compare
it
to
this
beer
has
a
taste
all
of
its
own
that
does
not
make
it
the
king
of
stouts
that
its
branding
would
have
you
believe
it
is
but
for
what
it
is
meant
to
be
this
is
a
decent
enough
brew
this
beer
is
more
than
drinkable
and
is
a
longstanding
favourite
here
in
ireland
its
relatively
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
a
very
sociable
drink
and
not
too
heavy
on
the
gut
like
some
i
think
it
tastes
exactly
as
it
smellsdark

and
malty
with

this
is

of

all

go
too
beers
if

something

yes
i
said
something
light
then
grab
a

low

is
my
idea
of
a

beer

i
keep
guinness
on
tap
always
at
my
home
along
with
two
other
beers
on

usally

and
many
other
crafted

beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
high

stout
this
is
not
for
you
this
is
something
you
can
session
and
goes
down
nice
after
cutting

very
good
many
much
like
o
one
of

drinks
of

at

and
while

almost
perfect
better
in
ireland
than
in
the
u
s
in
conclusion
this
is
a
beer
that
you
will
either
love
or
hate
but
i
recommend
you
finish
the
entire
glass
before
you
jump
to
any
sudden
conclusions
it
works
hard
for
your
approval
so
its
only
fair
that
you
take
the
time
to
listen
smooth
and
toasty
icon
of
mass
produced
dark
beers
a
dark
beer
available
on
most
corners
and
for
good
reason
pretty
good
stuff
nothing
spectacular
but
its
a
fine
beverage
to
be
sure
purchased
in
a
big
can
from
a
convenience
store
in
dundee
scotland
poured
into
a
plastic
hotel
cup
sot
not
ideal
condition
o
the
mouthfeel
is
the
main
detractor
here
but
guinness
is
full
of
flavour
and
is
a
very
reliable
beer
wonderfully
smooth
and
creamy
pours
to
a
thick
frothy
head
delicate
like
light
whipped
cream
the
aroma
is
mostly
roasted
malt
little
to
no
bitterness
the
taste
follows
the
nose
but
a
little
sweeter
and
creamier
almost
milky
but
in
a
very
enjoyable
way
hints
of
chocolate
has
a
reputation
for
being
a
heavy
beer
but
really
its
more
creamy
and
smooth
than
anything
overall
an
excellent
beer
definitely
one
for
any
beer
aficionados
beer
bucket
list
while
not
the
best
stout
and
certainly
not
the
worst
stout
one
cant
go
wrong
with
a
guinness
you
know
what
you
are
paying
for
and
you
know
despite
its
mediocrity
compared
to
other
more
complex
stouts
it
is
after
all
a
guinness
and
a
classic
more
of
a
starter
stout
for
newbies
opening
up
to
the
world
of
stouts
it
pours
a
opaque
dark
brown
almost
black
color
has
an
impressive
1
5
inch
foamy
creamy
khaki
head
that
dissipates
very
slowly
thanks
to
the
nitro
tap
most
places
put
the
clover
in
the
head
as
well
once
dissipated
it
leaves
minor
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roast
subtle
coffee
overtones
and
a
slightly
acidic
zing
to
the
nostrils
it
tastes
rather
dull
mostly
the
same
as
the
aromas
previously
mentioned
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
though
balanced
with
the
thick
head
a
lot
lighter
body
than
what
you
would
suspect
after
first
looking
at
a
guinness
overall
like
i
said
its
a
classic
and
you
when
you
want
a
guinness
you
want
a
guinness
i
only
drink
this
out
of
the
nitro
cans
when
store
bought
the
bottle
stuff
is
crap
smooth
and
creamy
almost
like
drinking
beer
clouds
love
it
or
hate
it
this
beer
demands
respect
my
irish
blood
demands
this
on
occasion
a
long
time
ago
before
i
really
stated
learning
about
beer
i
bought
the
guinnes
hype
like
most
people
i
found
the
first
few
pints
unpalatable
but
came
to
like
the
beer
after
some
time
then
i
discovered
real
flavour
and
didnt
touch
guinness
again
for
years
a
pint
of
guinness
looks
great
smells
uninteresting
has
a
one
dimensional
burnt
flavour
devoid
of
hops
and
an
overdeveloped
nitrohead
that
doesnt
seem
to
do
anything
other
than
maintain
the
good
appearance
until
the
point
is
finished
if
you
want
to
drink
guinness
and
have
flavour
ditch
this
and
stick
to
the
foreign
extra
offering
last
time
i
went
to
the
aforementioned
pub
i
brought
a
friend
along
and
she
also
ordered
a
guinness
i
figured
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
well
that
ended
with
me
having
two
beers
and
her
having
a
hard
cider
planning
on
being
strong
and
its
not
earthy
hints
of
char
light
smooth
and
finishes
slightly
with
a
faint
bitterness
from
roast
it
had
a
slight
imperfection
in
the
mouthfeel
as
it
was
actually
grainy
at
the
back
palate
an
actual
sensation
of
something
faintly
gritty
is
this
the
best
beer
ever
no
probably
not
but
sometimes
when
you
want
a
guinness
thats
all
you
want
and
nothing
else
will
do
i
always
laugh
when
people
seem
impressed
that
i
like
guinness
because
it
is
such
a
big
beer
i
think
what
is
big
about
it
its
very
low
in
alcohol
compared
to
most
of
the
american
abv
bombs
out
there
it
is
very
smooth
not
tons
of
flavor
creamy
it
is
dark
and
that
intimidates
most
people
but
i
find
it
more
mild
than
most
beers
in
some
ways
i
get
that
the
overall
review
for
this
beer
is
okay
but
then
i
dont
this
is
a
guinness
have
some
respect
its
true
what
they
say
guinness
is
a
reflection
of
ireland
and
vice
versa
it
didnt
grow
on
me
as
i
loved
the
flavor
and
allure
from
my
first
pint
in
belfast
thirteen
years
ago
a
standard
wherever
you
go
the
appearance
is
a
dark
black
with
a
coffee
head
that
takes
a
while
to
settle
down
the
smell
is
mostly
malt
with
a
bit
of
bread
smell
on
the
end
the
taste
was
not
bad
with
flavors
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
with
a
light
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
this
beer
is
a
really
dark
and
heavy
beer
at
least
it
was
that
way
for
myself
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
is
also
one
of
those
beers
that
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
at
the
same
time
the
aroma
was
a
good
aroma
their
is
a
lot
of
head
with
this
beer
wich
i
do
not
mind
that
much
but
for
a
dark
beer
it
was
not
that
bad
overall
3

captivating
cascade
of
bubbles
delicious
flavor
luscious
mouthfeel
o
not
bad
but
im
not
very
impressed
with
the
feel
had
this
beer
in
a
nitro
can
after
having
on
tap
the
day
prior
i
have
to
say
i
came
into
the
can
beer
with
high
expectations
the
appearance
looks
good
with
the
cascading
effect
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
typical
stout
roasted
malts
with
hint
of
coffeechocolate
then
i
got
to
the
taste
yuck
im
not
sure
how
they
call
that
a
stout
but
it
is
so
watery
and
bland
its
borderline
just
gross
not
too
happy
with
this
beer
by
guinness
this
beer
is
terrible
it
will
never
measure
up
enjoy
o
not
very
good
i
suppose
if
youre
at
an
outoftown
bar
and
theres
nothing
better
to
drink
drink
this
if
theres
yuengling
however
i
strongly
urge
you
to
go
for
the
yuengling
i
do
believe
this
is
a
better
beer
in
ireland
had
the
pleasure
of
touring
st
james
brewery
to
watch
the
boil
of
a
perfectly
drawn
guinness
is
a
true
pleasure
from
the
creamy
head
to
the
hints
of
chocolatecoffee
tones
i
rather
enjoy
this
beer
its
rich
history
helps
to
create
a
rather
magical
experience
for
the
consumer
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
probably
not
but
none
can
match
this
beers
place
in
history
after
all
those
stouts
that
we
enjoy
today
were
built
upon
this
beers
foundation
o
this
beer
is
an
acquired
taste
the
first
few
times
i
drank
it
i
hated
it
but
now
i
have
come
to
enjoy
this
brew
very
much
overall
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
but
it
doesnt
blow
my
mind
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
it
had
a
nice
black
color
body
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
malt
the
taste
has
a
little
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
hint
of
choclate
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
watery
overall
it
is
poor
additionally
can
and
packaging
came
without
abv
numbers
or
freshness
dates
which
is
rather
inexcusable
in
my
eyes
mouthfeel
was
good
def
one
of
my
favorites
now
its
a
bit
pricey
and
not
for
everyone
this
beer
looks
good
until
you
taste
it
the
darkness
leads
to
disappointment
when
you
realize
your
drinking
black
water
if
i
could
class
guinness
id
say
it
rates
flavorwise
with
a
cheap
light
beer
guiness
is
disappointing
on
all
levels
i
have
a
hard
time
with
all
the
peeps
who
swear
by
it
this
is
the
beer
for
people
who
want
to
look
bad
ass
but
still
drink
a
pussy
beer
poured
an
almost
nonexistent
head
beer
is
a
dark
seemingly
opaque
brown
has
a
malty
smell
slightly
watered
down
malty
chocolate
taste
some
lacing
occurs
has
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
ultimately
this
was
a
good
beer
didnt
like
it
in
college
but
it
has
grown
on
me
through
time
this
will
definitely
not
be
the
last
time
i
buy
guinness
almost
makes
me
want
shepherds
pie
other
than
murphys
this
is
probably
the
worst
stout
on
earth
thin
watery
bitter
flat
and
slightly
off
tasting
looks
okay
doesnt
smell
too
bad
or
have
a
terrible
mouth
feel
like
water
but
its
so
thin
and
dry
theres
no
desire
to
finish
the
bottle
wont
poison
you
but
id
need
to
be
awfully
thirsty
before
id
bother
drinking
it
it
must
be
a
really
good
beer
if
i
thought
it
was
okay
because
this
type
of
beer
in
general
is
not
in
my
wheelhouse
i
would
not
recommend
this
as
something
to
sip
on
during
a
hot
summer
afternoon
as
you
would
quickly
feel
full
and
bloated
o
i
would
be
lying
if
i
said
that
i
was
not
disappointed
guinness
carries
the
reputation
of
being
a
beer
that
you
drink
with
a
spoon
however
this
was
far
from
that
maybe
the
guinness
of
the
past
but
not
now
stick
to
the
extra
stout
for
a
real
beer
o
my
overall
impression
is
that
guinness
is
good
for
irish
car
bombs
that
is
about
all
i
would
use
it
for
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
bitch
black
in
color
with
ruby
high
lights
with
about
a
1finger
beige
creamy
head
lots
of
sticky
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
maltsbarley
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
is
about
the
same
and
is
smooth
and
creamy
perfect
carbonation
and
goes
down
easy
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
much
better
than
the
regular
guiness
in
my
opinion
in
my
opinion
guinness
draught
is
the
most
perfect
beer
out
there
the
hints
of
caramel
and
smooth
taste
and
finish
make
this
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
the
fact
that
the
nitro
can
guinness
tastes
exactly
the
same
as
the
guinness
you
can
get
on
tap
is
a
huge
plus
there
are
not
too
many
beers
in
which
you
can
say
that
about
i
am
partial
in
rating
this
as
guinness
is
my
favorite
im
sure
there
are
other
beers
out
there
but
guinness
is
easy
to
find
and
always
found
in
my
fridge
had
the
pleasure
of
dragging
my
bride
to
ireland
and
visit
where
it
all
began
ive
always
loved
the
silky
smooth
caress
the
stout
gives
my
tongue
with
each
drink
its
a
work
of
art
in
action
watching
the
amber
bubbles
swirl
in
the
chocolaty
darkness
i
wish
that
every
beer
lover
could
visit
this
place
just
once
to
taste
this
mana
from
heaven
havent
had
guinness
since
i
started
regularly
drinking
craft
brews
and
my
standards
have
certainly
risen
still
a
beauty
to
pour
but
no
longer
held
in
high
esteem
thinbodied
watery
bland
like
drinking
a
silky
water
nice
to
revisit
but
no
longer
a
goto
this
is
an
allround
fantastic
beer
guiness
is
certainly
a
dark
beer
i
had
it
on
tap
and
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
pleasant
very
frothy
good
carbonation
levels
takes
a
while
for
the
head
to
settle
i
would
reccomend
guiness
if
youre
interested
in
dark
beers
nice
clean
mouth
feel
with
little
lingering
flavors
many
years
ago
this
was
my
first
experience
with
dark
beer
i
believed
it
to
be
then
not
so
much
now
this
stout
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
and
lacing
the
nose
is
an
unnecessarily
sweet
blend
of
coffee
and
unfortunately
adjunct
malts
the
mouth
is
very
smooth
and
very
creamy
we
all
know
the
guinness
mouthfeel
and
wish
so
many
other
beers
could
achieve
it
the
flavor
is
overly
sweet
and
seems
like
mass
produced
beer
yet
it
still
has
all
the
rich
flavors
of
roasted
coffee
vanilla
and
dark
chocolate
for
a
mass
produced
stout
it
is
well
crafted
but
lacks
the
finesse
and
refinement
of
other
craft
stouts
this
is
a
nice
stout
beer
if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
nice
foam
on
top
its
is
malty
but
not
to
malty
for
my
taste
my
dad
drinks
guinness
all
the
time
i
tried
it
recently
and
loved
it
i
would
recommend
trying
the
beer
its
worth
a
shot
if
your
are
not
a
heavy
drinker
this
could
work
for
you
1
taste
and
you
will
enjoy
it
guiness
on
tap
can
be
pretty
spectacular
that
glorious
head
of
foam
the
magnificent
froth
that
dark
luscious
color
very
very
creamy
when
you
start
to
sip
tastes
smooth
almost
buttery
lightly
roasted
no
discernible
hops
or
carbonation
to
me
this
is
a
classic
beer
that
is
surprisingly
light
despite
its
dark
color
and
creaminess
tastes
great
in
an
irish
pub
or
almost
anywhere
i
wont
break
it
down
on
nosesmelletc
just
drink
it
enjoy
or
else
yer
just
not
right
in
the
head
like
my
wifelol
this
is
a
good
light
beer
to
sum
it
up
guinness
is
my
go
to
when
there
is
nothing
else
better
i
really
cant
rip
on
this
beer
though
that
seems
popular
in
these
web
pages
people
in
my
town
seem
to
really
like
it
butte
montana
home
of
a
large
irishamerican
population
ive
not
actually
drank
much
guinness
it
wasnt
very
available
during
my
younger
years
and
so
i
cant
compare
it
to
the
guinness
of
yore
or
of
ireland
that
many
people
equate
with
the
beverage
of
the
gods
ive
had
it
on
draft
locally
and
thought
it
was
perfectly
fine
though
nothing
to
rave
over
it
also
makes
a
good
black
and
tan
it
makes
a
pretty
good
session
beer
since
it
is
rather
light
in
carbs
calories
and
alcohol
body
is
really
light
and
delightful
all
the
carbon
goes
to
the
foam
and
the
carbonation
goes
to
zero
of
course
with
guinness
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
o
nice
beer
for
what
it
is
a
light
dry
sessionable
stout
no
major
flaws
but
nothing
outstanding
o
im
not
familiar
with
the
dry
irish
stout
style
ive
had
guinness
extra
stout
and
guinness
black
lager
both
of
which
i
find
much
more
enjoyable
i
cant
see
buying
guinness
draught
over
guinness
extra
stout
for
any
reason
based
on
other
reviews
along
with
some
articles
it
seems
that
this
beer
is
no
stranger
to
change
and
it
may
not
be
in
top
form
at
the
moment
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
however
i
prefer
a
thicker
stronger
more
robust
stout
i
was
introduced
to
guinness
a
long
time
ago
with
irish
car
bombs
but
now
i
ask
for
an
english
car
bomb
i
find
no
difference
between
draught
in
nitro
cans
or
bottles
overall
easily
drinkable
beer
nothing
special
average
i
think
ive
reviewed
this
before
but
id
just
like
to
remind
everyone
that
this
is
guinness
draught
it
only
comes
in
a
nitrocan
or
nitrotap
the
bottled
guinness
is
guinness
extra
cold
so
reviews
for
it
should
only
be
written
in
its
section
overall
not
my
everyday
drink
will
try
more
from
the
style
got
a
can
from
the
pool
bar
at
the
royal
pacific
resort
orlando
the
place
is
great
gotta
love
the
fast
pass
at
universal
studios
but
man
this
beer
sucks
i
like
guiness
stout
but
this
is
nothing
like
that
looks
good
enough
but
theres
hardly
any
aroma
and
it
tastes
like
flat
bland
water
i
mean
why
bother
if
you
like
tasting
absolutely
nothing
in
a
beer
then
go
for
it
otherwise
pass
on
this
swill
o
meh
one
of
the
classics
better
from
the
tap
overall
this
doesnt
have
the
robust
characteristics
i
enjoy
in
a
stout
if
i
were
to
blind
taste
this
i
wouldve
thought
this
was
a
middle
of
the
road
at
best
porter
when
i
step
into
a
bar
with
nothing
but
bmc
and
this
i
have
no
choice
but
thats
the
only
time
i
will
have
this
beer
overall
while
not
quite
as
good
as
i
had
remembered
it
guinness
remains
a
go
to
option
on
establishments
with
limited
tap
selection
and
a
fine
beer
to
consume
in
a
pinch
overall
ill
get
this
once
and
a
while
if
theres
no
other
options
on
tap
because
this
is
still
better
than
the
bmcs
of
the
world
not
by
much
though
i
would
like
to
try
this
in
ireland
sometime
to
compare
had
this
on
tap
at
a
red
robins
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
light
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
very
subtle
roasted
malts
flavor
is
water
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
has
a
light
very
watery
mouthfeel
sadly
i
enjoyed
my
water
from
the
restaurant
more
than
this
overall
in
the
world
of
noncraft
beer
guinness
reigns
as
king
of
the
stouts
o
i
like
this
beer
its
a
solid
nitro
stout
id
recommend
it
if
you
want
to
consume
a
lot
of
cheep
beer
without
getting
a
sour
aftertaste
guinness
leaves
a
pleasantly
bitter
aftertaste
id
also
recommend
it
if
you
dont
want
to
spend
a
ton
of
money
on
craft
beer
at
a
bar
and
just
want
to
hang
out
and
be
casual
if
youre
a
beer
drinker
youve
got
to
taste
a
guinness
draft
so
dark
yet
so
smooth
and
the
settling
is
a
process
in
itself
very
good
taste
and
appropriately
irish
very
good
to
be
able
to
drink
one
in
dublin
belfast
glasgow
or
edinburgh
is
to
taste
it
just
right
one
of
the
oldest
beers
in
the
world
bottom
line
meh
i
would
only
recommend
this
beer
if
youve
never
tried
it
just
to
add
it
to
your
repertoire
manage
your
expectations
though
the
only
good
thing
i
can
really
say
about
it
is
that
it
looks
pretty
when
you
pour
it
a
very
light
stout
without
much
flavor
always
gives
me
a
chuckle
when
people
refer
to
beers
as
as
thick
as
guinness
i
guess
it
is
what
it
is
a
refreshing
stout
thing
is
i
dont
really
want
my
stouts
to
be
refreshing
overall
guinness
draught
is
muchmaligned
but
it
gets
the
job
done
i
feel
this
beers
rating
suffers
because
so
many
people
think
of
it
as
the
apex
of
beer
and
its
clearly
not
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
a
fine
substitute
for
a
chocolatey
dessert
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
here
just
enjoy
it
not
sure
if
one
can
make
a
sound
argument
against
guinness
draught
you
dont
even
need
to
taste
it
to
know
that
it
has
full
flavor
you
can
clearly
see
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
really
goes
good
with
most
things
but
especially
burgers
and
other
red
meat
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
where
have
you
been
i
would
strongly
recommend
it
o
guinness
draught
always
looks
great
its
too
bad
that
the
rest
it
does
not
measure
up
not
all
bad
of
a
light
beer
however
few
beers
are
as
beautiful
as
this
one
yes
it
is
completely
overrated
it
tastes
like
a
water
of
sorts
has
a
very
faint
smell
has
a
low
abv
and
costs
too
much
however
its
still
enjoyable
in
the
total
sum
of
all
its
parts
and
has
a
great
story
and
history
its
amazingly
drinkable
and
smooth
i
will
of
course
and
with
little
shame
get
this
again
o
i
understand
that
most
irishmen
say
you
havent
had
a
real
guinness
unless
its
straight
from
the
horses
mouth
i
can
definitely
see
where
theyre
coming
from
i
hope
to
visit
ireland
soon
not
just
for
the
beer
of
course
although
that
is
one
reason
and
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
it
out
however
ive
never
had
a
pint
of
this
beer
that
i
didnt
like
great
drinking
experience
that
is
widely
available
looking
forward
to
my
next
one
o
this
is
my
go
to
at
bars
when
they
have
limited
selection
of
drafts
or
craft
brews
especially
when
you
know
they
will
give
you
the
proper
2
part
draught
pour
to
ensure
an
extra
creamy
head
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
and
probably
even
the
flagship
one
i
must
be
honest
guinness
draught
on
tap
is
my
unicorn
mysterious
beautiful
and
unfairly
better
than
most
beers
jet
black
in
appearance
and
no
light
is
getting
through
this
brew
nice
half
inch
thick
layer
of
tightly
packed
foam
on
top
brussels
lace
on
the
glass
lots
of
roasted
barley
in
the
nose
the
mouth
is
creamydryand
silky
smooth
i
get
loads
and
loads
of
roasted
barley
and
a
bit
of
raisins
in
the
flavor
im
appreciate
this
beer
it
doesnt
excel
in
any
one
area
but
its
easy
to
drink
its
light
and
it
has
character
and
thats
a
lot
more
than
can
be
said
about
a
lot
of
stouts
out
there
cheers
only
poor
thing
is
my
english
this
legendary
irish
stout
is
only
good
on
tap
served
in
any
other
form
it
is
a
completely
different
drink
a
very
nice
stout
defenitely
not
irelands
best
if
you
are
visiting
ireland
i
would
reccomend
buying
one
of
these
but
not
before
beamish
personally
i
think
this
is
much
heavier
than
beamish
and
taste
can
differ
from
pub
to
pub
oi
think
my
expectation
where
too
high
on
this
beer
appearance
is
black
though
in
the
right
lighting
you
can
see
the
ruby
red
tinge
within
your
glass
great
heading
thanks
to
the
nitro
bubble
in
the
can
that
tsst
sound
when
you
pop
it
open
is
a
beautiful
sound
indeed
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
not
in
an
unpleasant
way
very
drinkable
stout
with
little
carbonation
you
may
end
up
drinking
more
than
you
expected
to
drink
taste
is
light
with
malty
notes
and
very
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
on
the
finish
this
beer
goes
great
with
almost
any
food
closest
thing
youll
get
to
having
guinness
on
tap
overall
ok
but
not
good
might
be
better
at
cellar
temp
overall
for
someone
looking
to
get
into
stouts
guinness
is
a
great
place
to
start
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
macro
brewery
god
created
a
beer
and
he
named
it
guinness
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
welcome
to
earth
if
you
have
had
it
chances
are
youre
not
reading
reviews
youre
probably
ordering
your
next
guinness
smooth
dense
heavy
but
not
daunting
history
in
liquid
form
guinness
gets
too
much
hate
simply
for
being
a
macro
it
doesnt
compare
to
the
better
thicker
more
creative
stouts
but
its
not
bad
and
its
just
a
tiny
step
behind
some
of
the
lesser
craft
stouts
its
a
very
low
abv
beer
a
better
bigger
chewier
mouthfeel
would
have
made
this
beer
significantly
more
enjoyable
overall
would
not
drink
again
would
sooner
have
a
diet
coke
classic
used
to
love
it
15
years
ago
but
general
benchmark
moved
up
now
there
are
lots
of
better
choices
o
the
extra
stout
is
leaps
and
bounds
ahead
of
this
overall
guinness
draught
is
a
great
beer
for
those
who
want
to
try
a
dry
stout
but
are
afraid
of
dark
beers
this
used
to
be
my
favorite
stout
before
i
began
exploring
the
beer
culture
i
have
tried
numerous
other
irish
dry
stouts
that
have
surpassed
guinness
since
i
have
opened
my
eyes
to
new
beers
guinness
has
fallen
as
a
runofthemill
stout
as
many
people
have
said
on
here
it
is
a
typical
goto
stout
when
nothing
else
is
available
like
at
a
typical
restaurant
nothing
special
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
its
got
just
enough
roasted
flavors
to
fit
in
to
the
style
while
not
being
too
filling
and
staying
sessionable
like
it
should
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
its
smooth
creamy
not
too
filling
and
its
got
just
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
till
i
get
drunk
and
not
care
about
taste
anymore
i
like
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
the
most
to
me
thats
one
thing
that
sets
this
beer
apart
from
other
beers
in
the
style
what
i
liked
the
least
amount
this
beer
is
the
taste
and
aroma
i
think
it
could
handle
a
little
more
roast
but
i
can
see
how
people
like
it
just
how
it
is
i
only
really
buy
this
beer
for
st
patricks
day
but
i
will
order
it
at
a
bar
if
there
isnt
anything
better
available
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
looking
to
get
into
the
world
of
dark
beers
it
may
not
be
like
a
lot
of
dark
beers
but
it
gives
you
a
slight
idea
of
what
they
are
like
all
in
all
i
dont
mind
this
beer
its
nothing
that
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
when
the
options
are
low
this
makes
for
a
good
alternative
overall
after
a
lifetime
of
hearing
great
things
about
guinness
i
was
very
disappointed
with
my
experience
its
really
just
a
great
looking
beer
but
fails
to
be
interesting
in
any
of
the
other
categories
its
an
extremely
bland
and
flavorless
beer
do
not
recommend
i
generally
drink
this
as
a
go
to
beer
if
i
cant
find
any
quality
craft
beer
be
it
where
i
happen
to
be
overall
a
decentgood
goto
beer
when
in
a
pub
or
bar
and
nothing
else
is
available
the
verdict
its
ok
i
know
its
considered
the
gold
standard
of
irish
stouts
but
i
find
it
a
bit
bland
and
underwhelming
if
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looks
it
would
be
nearly
perfect
pleased
ive
put
some
words
down
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
a
pint
3
actually
at
the
brewery
in
dublin
trust
me
its
awesome
on
draught
at
the
brewery
thick
and
creamy
and
so
smooth
jet
black
with
a
off
white
head
that
stayed
to
the
end
of
the
glass
it
seems
the
abv
of
guinness
in
ireland
is
a
touch
higher
than
whats
available
in
the
states
also
definitely
will
go
again
if
i
get
the
chance
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
that
displays
and
insane
level
of
retention
smells
of
roasted
grains
a
hint
of
fruit
and
a
touch
of
tart
the
flavor
mimics
the
aroma
fairly
well
coffee
like
roasted
grains
that
are
quite
drying
with
hints
of
fruit
and
tart
light
to
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
creamy
mouthfeel
an
old
favorite
that
i
revisited
today
solid
brew
a
bit
simple
and
not
the
fantastic
beer
i
thought
it
was
so
long
ago
oa
benchmark
for
irish
stout
i
suppose
but
prefer
other
styles
for
sure
im
drinking
at
home
in
boston
ive
been
trying
different
ways
of
drinking
guinness
at
home
ive
been
leaving
out
the
cans
to
get
to
the
proper
room
temperature
and
then
in
a
glass
doing
a
three
pour
to
let
the
head
properly
settle
it
helps
but
after
the
head
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
water
overall
this
used
to
be
one
of
the
kings
of
craft
beer
though
was
it
ever
really
considered
craft
no
and
ill
give
it
that
but
this
is
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
roasted
malt
roasted
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
twang
is
what
makes
this
beer
the
stout
that
all
others
apsire
to
be
overall
this
is
my
favorite
goto
beer
and
the
standard
i
judge
all
other
beers
by
i
would
give
this
beer
a
5
00
but
i
am
holding
out
for
that
perfect
beer
in
the
hopes
of
one
day
finding
it
if
i
do
not
find
it
i
will
edit
my
rating
to
a
5
00
overall
though
i
know
that
there
are
probably
dozens
of
stouts
better
than
this
irish
dry
stout
i
still
really
enjoy
a
guinness
its
an
oldy
but
goody
it
have
always
been
a
fan
of
stouts
therefore
my
opinion
will
be
somewhat
biased
guinness
draught
is
just
the
standard
irish
dry
stout
you
know
what
you
are
getting
before
buying
it
and
it
does
not
go
better
or
worst
for
me
guinness
is
like
mcdonalds
you
know
that
there
are
better
things
out
there
but
for
some
reason
you
always
go
back
and
buy
guinness
because
it
never
disappoints
overall
for
those
of
us
who
grew
up
with
this
beer
still
a
good
one
does
not
measure
up
in
any
way
with
most
of
the
stouts
out
there
now
but
every
now
and
then
i
certainly
enjoy
one
and
would
never
turn
it
down
if
offered
still
deserves
some
respect
o
it
smells
more
flavorful
then
it
really
is
its
a
great
beer
to
have
if
youre
barely
going
into
stout
beers
but
the
mouthfeel
is
awful
this
was
the
downfall
of
this
beer
its
just
way
to
watery
for
a
stout
and
it
just
really
throws
you
off
when
the
appearance
and
the
smell
suggests
something
larger
i
guess
the
low
alcohol
is
the
reason
why
its
so
thin
but
man
such
a
let
down
o
the
highlight
is
the
creamy
mouthfeel
but
aroma
and
taste
are
only
slightly
above
average
overall
looks
awesome
in
a
glass
but
when
it
comes
to
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
am
disappointed
an
ok
stout
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
amazing
either
even
with
the
light
body
and
low
abv
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
two
in
a
row
overall
an
amazing
session
beer
inoffensive
taste
attached
to
a
highly
drinkable
body
far
from
the
best
stout
but
its
far
from
being
offensive
o
as
with
many
beer
aficionados
this
was
my
gateway
beer
this
and
a
handful
of
irish
stouts
were
for
the
longest
time
the
only
conception
of
beer
that
i
had
other
than
macro
light
lagers
like
bud
and
coors
back
then
i
thought
this
was
head
and
shoulders
above
those
light
lagers
now
that
ive
come
this
far
i
can
see
that
its
really
the
same
concept
brew
a
bland
uniform
inoffensive
beer
and
rely
heavily
on
deep
pockets
and
marketing
to
spread
it
around
the
globe
and
make
maximum
profit
sacrificing
quality
along
the
way
if
necessary
i
will
go
on
the
record
as
saying
that
i
still
enjoy
a
guinness
from
time
to
time
and
that
my
own
personal
preference
would
still
lead
me
to
drink
a
guinness
over
a
macro
light
lager
but
when
i
look
at
guinness
draught
in
terms
of
whats
available
and
stack
it
up
against
some
of
the
other
irish
stouts
on
the
market
craft
brewed
and
otherwise
it
falls
well
short
of
the
mark
overall
i
liked
a
guinness
here
and
there
i
havent
had
it
since
i
went
vegan
but
its
definitely
a
decent
beer
that
you
can
get
almost
anywhere
everyone
should
try
it
at
least
once
o
not
really
a
stout
drinker
but
i
quite
like
guinness
if
only
it
was
not
so
bitter
i
prefer
murphys
stout
as
its
a
bit
sweeter
and
easier
to
drink
on
occasion
i
enjoy
a
pint
of
guinness
but
one
pint
is
enough
for
me
in
a
sitting
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
to
be
more
robust
but
the
watery
taste
and
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
good
lawnmower
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
it
does
taste
good
o
a
lot
of
people
complain
that
this
is
just
a
plain
beer
and
really
light
and
its
all
just
marketing
in
a
way
thats
true
guinness
draught
isnt
a
heavy
complex
porter
that
will
change
your
perspective
of
beer
but
its
a
good
simple
alternative
to
the
other
basic
lagers
or
porters
you
might
order
with
dinner
or
at
a
cafe
its
light
enough
to
not
dominate
a
meal
or
fill
you
up
but
its
creamy
and
tasty
enough
to
be
an
enjoyable
alternative
when
you
want
something
a
bit
different
either
way
im
still
quite
fond
of
this
beer
i
said
theres
something
missing
in
the
flavor
and
i
know
what
it
is
the
alcohol
is
so
subdued
it
couldnt
be
said
to
exist
at
all
it
has
less
abv
than
a
budweiser
what
are
they
doing
here
the
strong
notes
in
the
flavor
are
the
reason
stouts
are
usually
so
high
in
alcohol
its
balance
either
way
theyre
not
going
to
see
this
review
you
are
and
im
saying
its
good
but
lessens
the
guinness
reputation
significantly
the
taste
is
toasty
charred
malt
with
a
back
end
of
sweet
creaminess
problem
is
as
good
as
it
tastes
its
simply
not
tasty
enough
the
whole
taste
gets
lost
in
a
wash
of
watery
finish
and
feel
the
nitro
seems
to
take
away
the
very
essence
of
the
beer
and
depletes
what
i
always
felt
was
a
very
good
stout
pours
dark
black
color
with
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
very
good
aroma
is
not
very
strong
slightly
roasted
malty
aroma
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
is
really
watered
down
up
front
continuing
with
a
watered
down
roasted
coffee
taste
not
sure
if
this
is
an
out
of
date
can
shouldnt
be
but
i
remember
guinness
being
better
9it
has
been
a
while
though
overall
if
every
beer
could
look
like
guinness
masterful
head
that
just
sits
there
no
beer
drinker
would
ever
go
unhappy
however
character
goes
deeper
than
appearance
and
unfortunately
guinness
isnt
all
that
its
cracked
up
to
be
underneath
the
incredible
looks
a
watereddown
diminished
taste
for
a
beer
that
looks
absolutely
incredible
i
would
get
this
on
tap
if
better
options
werent
available
and
may
purchase
in
nitrocans
if
hosting
parties
or
making
poor
mans
velvets
but
would
not
purchase
in
a
nonnitro
format
i
fear
that
the
wateriness
would
be
all
too
evident
in
other
formats
if
you
drink
dont
drive
but
if
you
drive
do
us
all
a
favor
and
dont
drink
stay
safe
for
what
it
is
meant
to
be
it
does
the
job
exceptionally
well
if
you
expect
this
beer
to
make
your
day
or
give
you
a
psychospiritual
experience
get
real
its
guinness
its
a
pint
of
plain
you
order
it
with
your
burger
because
you
want
to
enjoy
your
burger
enjoyed
at
the
guinness
factory
in
dublin
ireland
on
tap
also
enjoyed
at
multiple
bars
in
ireland
guinness
factorys
was
the
best
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
its
like
tasting
the
milk
from
a
goddesses
teats
dont
drink
guinness
in
the
united
states
it
tastes
like
piss
trust
me
it
really
does
taste
different
in
ireland
very
creamy
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
for
a
moment
makes
you
think
that
this
beer
isnt
as
light
as
it
is
so
in
a
sense
this
is
the
beer
that
enlightened
me
to
the
fact
that
american
light
lagers
were
not
the
only
option
and
ive
been
on
a
quest
to
try
as
many
different
kinds
of
beers
as
i
can
since
then
o
well
this
might
be
one
of
the
worst
stouts
ive
ever
had
thats
not
to
say
this
is
horrible
its
ok
but
im
used
to
stouts
being
rich
and
complex
not
like
this
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
nothing
outright
unpleasant
or
offensive
about
this
beer
but
i
have
absolutely
no
desire
to
drink
this
again
as
every
aspect
fell
short
of
expectations
poured
into
an
elysian
snifter
pours
pitch
black
with
a
very
fine
two
finger
light
tan
head
from
the
nitro
can
aroma
of
mild
toasted
malt
and
nuts
mildly
sweet
attenuated
flavor
of
light
toasted
malt
milk
chocolate
nuts
finishes
very
mild
hops
and
residual
malt
light
body
without
any
creaminess
id
expect
from
the
nice
head
i
enjoy
an
occasional
actual
draught
guinness
although
it
is
mild
by
comparison
to
the
stouts
i
usually
drink
but
this
tastes
like
that
guinness
slightly
watered
down
a
pleasant
irish
dry
stout
but
very
attenuated
in
flavor
it
was
a
reasonable
accompaniment
to
dinner
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
this
was
helped
by
the
surprisingly
wellretained
head
giving
big
cream
and
slurp
throughout
the
entire
tasting
otherwise
the
nose
and
flavoring
while
showing
some
positive
and
robust
fruitiness
phenols
and
char
gave
too
much
on
the
metallics
and
the
dry
chalky
yeastiness
that
being
said
the
nose
was
better
than
the
flavoring
and
everything
else
just
screams
standard
oh
well
its
still
miles
ahead
of
that
yellow
fizzy
stuff
o
i
like
this
but
i
would
usually
take
something
else
if
it
were
available
however
is
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
good
session
beer
given
the
abv
and
drinkability
for
the
price
there
are
some
far
better
stouts
out
there
if
you
want
to
try
this
one
make
sure
you
get
the
nitro
version
or
on
tap
i
dont
drink
stouts
often
but
i
would
choose
this
one
over
murphys
and
guinness
foreign
any
day
one
thing
i
always
tell
people
who
ask
about
guinness
is
that
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
beer
i
dont
drink
guinness
it
has
none
of
the
flavors
of
what
i
think
of
in
beer
whether
that
be
wheat
hops
bitter
etc
its
something
smooth
and
wonderful
to
drink
i
had
this
at
a
restaurant
and
i
honestly
was
able
to
down
only
about
the
first
4
ounces
before
i
gave
up
my
wife
sipped
it
and
wouldnt
have
any
more
my
son
drank
maybe
an
ounce
made
a
face
and
gave
up
we
left
the
restaurant
with
still
at
least
6
ounces
left
in
the
glass
overall
i
cant
shake
the
feeling
that
this
worldfamous
beer
probably
the
most
famous
of
the
stouts
relies
on
a
combination
of
marketing
and
its
nitrogen
widget
for
its
success
attempting
to
disregard
the
aspects
that
the
nitrogen
lends
to
the
beer
it
is
actually
very
simple
and
unimpressive
its
not
bad
but
it
just
isnt
good
on
this
2014
paddys
day
i
remember
back
to
a
year
ago
when
i
had
a
guinness
draught
on
tap
at
a
pub
in
ireland
a
small
pub
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
country
far
from
dublin
but
this
little
stone
pub
darkly
lit
with
a
great
fireplace
and
notsogreat
fish
n
chips
served
me
my
first
guinness
yes
thats
right
never
had
one
in
the
states
at
that
point
that
dark
creamy
rich
taste
and
texture
was
amazing
and
now
sipping
on
a
guinness
draught
bought
in
kansas
city
i
see
why
people
say
you
have
to
have
guinness
in
ireland
to
appreciate
it
4
55
on
tap
in
ireland
3
55
at
best
in
a
can
in
the
states
i
figured
st
patricks
day
was
a
good
day
to
finally
actually
review
this
one
poured
on
nitrotap
at
dugans
on
31713
this
beer
does
look
very
nice
in
the
glass
this
is
of
course
one
of
the
more
common
introduction
beers
for
most
people
to
something
other
than
a
macrolager
it
looks
wonderfully
deep
dark
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
very
nice
white
frothy
head
developing
from
the
creamy
pour
the
smell
just
isnt
there
though
after
years
of
drinking
other
stouts
this
beer
just
lacks
the
good
nose
of
a
stout
theres
some
light
bread
crust
smell
and
maybe
some
dried
grass
but
its
not
much
the
taste
while
better
than
a
regular
can
or
regular
tap
line
is
still
just
average
its
creamy
and
dry
finishing
but
very
watery
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
just
so
wimpy
after
you
drink
other
stouts
tastes
mostly
of
brown
bread
and
a
little
of
bitter
dry
hops
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
great
i
just
tried
this
heard
so
many
bad
things
ill
just
say
i
really
liked
it
very
flavorful
almost
nutty
intense
feel
nice
head
very
good
would
definitely
drink
again
i
loved
it
tried
twice
liked
better
cold
more
flavor
bitter
but
still
good
overall
an
average
stout
smooth
taste
and
a
decent
place
to
introduce
a
lager
boy
to
the
world
of
stouts
o
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
someone
else
was
buying
final
thoughts
guinness
draught
is
basically
the
classic
session
ale
however
without
the
nitrogen
widget
it
would
probably
not
be
as
popular
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
its
a
classic
that
almost
every
non
craft
beer
bar
has
on
hand
not
impressed
this
is
the
prototypical
irish
beer
and
im
sad
for
ireland
because
of
it
pretty
average
not
a
lot
of
flavor
i
prefer
murphys
to
guinness
two
words
nondescript
staple
poured
a
14
9
oz
can
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
deep
deep
brown
not
quite
black
with
a
thick
cappuccinocolored
head
that
last
throughout
and
leaves
big
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
has
hints
of
roasted
malt
some
coffee
but
not
much
and
a
little
nondescript
sweetness
taste
is
about
the
same
and
the
nitro
can
provides
a
velvetysmooth
mouthfeel
ill
say
this
is
not
the
best
way
to
have
guinness
and
that
the
best
ive
ever
had
was
in
dublin
both
at
the
brewery
and
the
numerous
pubs
throughout
the
town
love
this
beer
it
is
the
standard
for
all
stoutsimports
irish
beers
and
any
type
of
beer
for
that
matter
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
upcoming
events
such
as
saint
patricks
day
overall
this
is
essentially
the
only
macro
beer
i
ever
consider
buying
unfortunately
thats
about
the
biggest
compliment
i
can
give
it
in
all
fairness
though
its
not
a
bad
beer
when
alls
said
and
done
and
on
certain
occasions
i
just
cant
help
drinking
a
few
cough
st
patricks
day
overall
good
but
not
great
will
drink
casually
o
great
legacy
beer
simple
stout
its
a
gateway
stout
it
was
for
me
it
could
be
alot
better
but
its
not
bad
i
gotta
give
this
one
fairly
high
ratings
its
a
respectable
brew
it
leads
many
to
better
stouts
and
compared
to
other
mass
produces
beers
this
is
the
top
brew
cheers
dark
appearance
flavors
are
very
faint
and
muted
but
what
is
there
is
pleasant
mild
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
make
up
a
very
thin
and
watery
body
reminiscent
of
folgers
instant
coffee
a
barebones
irish
stout
lies
somewhere
between
not
bad
and
almost
good
pours
a
foamy
but
thin
head
which
lingers
black
as
the
night
my
nose
is
always
an
awful
judge
of
smell
and
im
not
getting
anything
right
now
has
that
subtle
chocolate
taste
with
a
nutty
caramel
hint
extremely
drinkable
satisfying
lovely
overall
a
fairly
simple
drink
that
you
have
all
of
a
sudden
had
4
or
5
of
not
too
bad
at
all
its
a
typical
pure
black
with
a
smallish
head
and
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
faint
but
nice
the
taste
is
mild
and
creamy
and
the
finish
is
the
same
its
like
the
ones
ive
had
with
the
widget
but
not
as
good
i
am
enjoying
my
irish
saturday
o
4
lots
of
nostalgia
comes
with
this
beer
for
me
hence
the
4
for
overall
i
always
love
it
for
what
it
is
however
i
tried
not
to
be
too
bias
with
this
review
this
is
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
every
once
in
awhile
ill
get
a
craving
for
the
unique
experience
guinness
provides
much
preferring
their
extra
stout
and
the
draught
is
a
perfect
companion
for
a
thick
burger
or
heavy
chili
a
beer
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
cheers
still
the
best
fallback
beer
in
the
average
british
pub
almost
every
pub
has
it
and
its
reliably
tasty
if
the
draught
version
had
a
little
more
body
it
would
be
a
truly
great
beer
ahha
pint
of
plain
the
workmans
friend
a
guinness
draught
a
living
piece
of
history
directly
from
dear
old
ireland
supposedly
anyway
i
like
guinness
for
what
is
not
for
what
i
want
it
to
be
and
thats
enough
for
me
guinness
is
now
a
mass
produced
megabrew
and
the
reality
is
that
its
not
much
better
than
any
other
brew
produced
on
that
scale
initially
it
pours
dark
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
disappears
soon
enough
the
first
sip
tastes
of
roasted
malted
barley
but
as
your
taste
buds
adapt
to
the
smoky
dark
flavor
it
has
a
refreshing
but
watery
taste
it
is
a
porter
in
name
only
and
much
closer
in
taste
to
a
dark
lager
such
as
michelob
dark
although
smoother
than
more
drinkable
im
not
necessarily
a
beer
snob
but
a
modern
guinness
draught
is
no
match
for
a
quality
microbrewed
porter
you
wont
have
to
twist
my
arm
too
hard
to
get
me
to
drink
one
but
this
beer
is
nothing
special
o
looks
great
no
substance
whatsoever
i
truly
appreciate
the
fullness
of
this
beer
it
has
a
great
taste
and
a
welcoming
follow
i
would
be
happy
to
have
this
at
my
home
do
not
be
afraid
of
its
dark
color
or
its
thick
nature
she
will
be
one
of
the
best
dark
stouts
you
will
ingest
i
am
amazed
to
say
that
its
tastes
good
also
in
can
or
bottle
form
although
i
do
prefer
it
by
the
pint
off
the
tap
o
very
watery
and
light
stout
with
no
real
outstanding
smell
or
flavor
it
looks
nice
though
o
not
very
impressed
it
just
kinda
sits
there
hoping
for
a
charge
of
real
stoutness
o
good
into
fro
people
into
dark
beers
and
often
saves
me
from
not
having
beer
at
a
bar
but
does
leave
more
to
be
desired
from
a
stout
o
for
as
long
as
i
could
remember
guinness
draught
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
finally
getting
to
have
it
on
tap
poured
in
the
correct
manner
is
just
incredible
it
just
tastes
so
much
different
than
the
canned
guinness
or
the
bottled
guinness
or
guinness
just
sloshed
into
a
glass
by
an
inexperienced
beer
pourer
long
live
guinness
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
black
with
a
thin
white
head
there
is
some
lacing
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
by
the
head
which
is
retained
well
during
consumption
the
beer
has
the
aroma
of
sweet
and
dark
roasted
malts
and
some
coffee
the
taste
follows
the
nose
and
has
the
familiar
flavors
of
guinness
in
a
more
watery
form
the
roastiness
is
forward
with
some
mild
malt
sweetness
the
coffee
notes
blend
well
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
provided
by
the
nitro
widget
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
stout
this
is
an
excellent
beer
overall
nothing
astounding
and
there
is
definitely
better
in
the
stout
department
but
i
like
it
i
drink
it
from
time
to
time
its
a
little
bit
over
hyped
but
its
still
pretty
decent
for
a
macro
stout
tastes
similarly
weak
roasted
barley
and
cardboard
folgers
vague
ashy
note
in
the
aftertaste
watery
feel
bland
with
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
seems
to
be
a
mere
shell
of
its
former
self
or
maybe
the
added
nitrogen
adds
something
and
without
it
theres
just
not
much
substance
o
if
i
had
to
pick
one
beer
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
be
it
it
has
a
nourishing
yet
refreshing
quality
its
lower
in
calories
than
most
light
beers
yet
is
packed
with
flavor
its
low
alcohol
content
means
you
can
have
a
couple
without
getting
swimmy
it
is
the
perfect
representation
of
a
dry
irish
stout
this
is
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
guinness
mug
coded
bottled
date
this
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
large
foamy
mocha
colored
head
far
larger
than
im
used
to
on
nitro
bottles
perhaps
this
is
due
to
removing
the
nitro
widget
this
has
an
extremely
long
retention
time
and
leaves
a
lacing
everywhere
it
touches
the
smells
are
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
the
guinness
burnt
smells
the
feel
is
medium
to
thick
and
creamy
more
warm
this
is
better
the
taste
is
light
but
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
you
get
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
little
burnt
malt
bitterness
more
subtle
than
the
traditional
guinness
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
a
great
session
one
and
i
often
order
it
with
my
meal
o
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
guinness
if
you
dont
like
it
you
still
cant
help
but
respect
it
i
happen
to
like
and
respect
it
m
mouth
feel
is
watery
very
light
feel
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
low
on
carbonation
very
disappointing
product
by
guinness
been
a

appearance
is
not

fulsome
as
the

version
no

taste
is
flatter
as
well
but
still
very
pleasing
to
the
palate
overall
all
in
all
guinness
is
a
pretty
standard
stout
that
benefits
from
a
good
reputation
history
and
marketing
team
i
prefer
the
extra
stout
to
the
draught
version
but
theres
still
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
one
either
pretty
much
feels
like
drinking
water
that
dries
out
your
mouth
overall
a
light
easydrinking
beer
that
bears
little
in
common
with
most
other
stouts
even
the
black
lager
might
be
closer
guinness
from
the
bottle
or
from
the
can
are
not
nearly
as
good
because
they
tend
not
to
drink
as
smooth
maybe
its
the
aging
that
is
done
or
the
characteristics
of
the
can
or
bottle
that
it
picks
up
but
you
cannot
get
anything
better
than
guinness
on
tap
in
ireland
very
easy
to
drink
but
does
not
feel
like
you
are
drinking
anything
which
is
a
bad
thing
for
such
an
acclaimed
stout
pours
pitch
black
with
a
thick
very
fine

good

and
lacing
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
very
light

is
slightly
bitter
from
the
malt
character
not
much
too
it
slightly
alcoholic
in
the
finish
medium
carbonation
light
body
for
a
stout
mouthfeel
is
watery
overall
not
my
favorite
by
far
there
just
is
not
much
to
this
beer
and
it
does
not
fit
well
into
the
style
o
this
makes
me
remember
why
forign
extra
and
plain
old
extra
stout
have
made
me
jaded
and
wont
get
guinness
on
tap
unless
i
am
in
a
crappy
bar
where
my
options
are
budweiser
or
guinness
all
in
all
i
am
left
wanting
but
you
know
one
of
the
best
macros
i
know
of
reviewing
beers
on
this
site
is
surely
subjective
but
when
it
comes
to
rating
a
beer
it
should
be
based
on
its
merits
compared
to
other
beers
of
the
same
style
hands
down
this
is
the
best
irish
dry
stout
from
draft
on
the
planet
this
is
the
benchmark
no
questions
asked
id
highly
encourage
people
to
remember
that
when
they
are
reviewing
this
beer
i
understand
the
bottle
and
canned
version
of
this
can
vary
greatly
while
a
nonirish
tap
will
not
taste
as
good
however
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
enjoy
a
pint
of
this
from
a
pub
in
dublin
rest
assured
you
will
not
be
disappointed
if
you
find
another
irish
dry
stout
that
is
more
enjoyable
please
send
me
a
bottle
or
message
with
the
name
and
id
love
to
try
it
until
i
find
one
that
is
better
ill
keep
going
back
to
this
beautiful
creation
every
time
i
need
a
quick
reminder
of
what
started
my
love
and
enjoyment
for
craft
beer
cheers
arthur
and
heres
to
another
253
years
of
the
beautiful
black
stuff
o
ive
been
serious
about
beer
for
a
year
and
my
palate
has
evolved
somewhat
its
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
insipid
than
i
remember
but
for
the
casual
beer
drinker
its
still
a
great
alternative
to
lager
is
there
a
better
massdistributed
macro
beer
o
creamy
light
stout
it
does
the
job
when
thats
what
youre
looking
for
which
isnt
often
overall
this
is
a
classic
may
not
be
the
best
stout
but
it
is
a
good
staple
that
can
be
found
many
places
overall
a
favorite
of
mine
gun
to
my
head
i
might
order
a
guinness
before
the
trigger
is
pulled
i
just
returned
from
spending
10
days
in
ireland
and
have
to
say
the
imported
guinness
i
just
picked
up
tonight
in
bottles
is
way
different
from
what
i
had
on
tap
while
in
ireland
ive
had
a
few
guinness
over
the
years
but
had
to
pick
up
a
12
pack
after
returning
home
to
judge
the
difference
overall
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
is
no
comparison
to
the
outstanding
guiness
on
tap
so
i
am
slightly
biased
its
pretty
much
a
staple
in
every
pub
but
for
the
imported
bottles
used
for
this
review
make
it
just
an
ok
beer
the
head
is
much
smaller
and
the
smell
and
taste
is
just
average
overall
meh
ive
had
plenty
of
nitro
stouts
and
guinness
is
by
far
the
most
watered
down
mass
appealing
of
the
lot
hey
at
least
the
lacing
is
still
there
after
20
minutes
o
very
solid
stout
not
my
favorite
but
an
easy
drinking
decent
beer
overall
a
classic
and
favourite
but
something
just
seems
amiss
lately
like
something
changed
overall
well
its
guinness
nothing
special
just
something
you
should
get
on
tap
at
least
once
looked
great
with
an
awesome
creamy
head
beat
lacing
imaginable
however
thats
where
the
goodness
ends
like
most
mainstream
import
beers
i
feel
guinness
has
toned
down
its
flavor
to
appealto
amercan
beer
drinkers
the
smell
was
absent
and
the
taste
was
barely
there
watery
with
only
a
hint
of
roasted
cocoa
i
will
never
drink
this
beer
in
the
us
again
note
the
guinness
recipe
outside
of
ireland
is
different
for
each
region
of
the
world
the
foreign
extra
for
africa
is
another
favorite
overall
this
is
the
standard
that
all
stouts
should
aspire
to
i
have
had
this
in
a
bottle
and
a
can
but
on
nitrotap
is
the
best
terrific
when
coupled
with
bass
ale
to
make
a
black
tan
i
cant
quite
see
how
this
beer
falls
within
the
stout
classification
it
seemed
more
like
a
schwarzbier
to
me
its
a
nice
beer
for
the
summer
when
youre
tired
of
lighter
styles
like
pilsners
or
pale
ales
overall
it
may
not
taste
the
best
or
have
the
most
to
offer
after
all
the
big
stouts
ive
had
but
ill
always
enjoy
this
beer
i
think
overall
a
very
nice
fairly
simple
beer
that
exemplifies
the
style
o
watered
down
enough
that
you
can
drink
this
without
wanting
to
rip
your
tongue
out
yet
strong
enough
to
make
you
want
more
a
good
beer
but
pricey
great
session
beer
truly
great
at
the
low
abv
d
very
drinkable
the
nitro
really
gives
this
beer
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
and
the
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
to
support
that
this
is
a
great
session
beer
also
good
as
a
nightcap
after
an
evening
of
heavy
craft
beer
drinking
due
to
its
smooth
feel
and
low
abv
last
night
i
had
this
right
after
a
stone
10th
anniversary
ruination
and
i
slept
very
well
recommended
as
an
entrylevel
stout
subdecent
beer
at
best
pours
a
nice
dark
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
about
the
only
appealing
thing
about
this
beer
the
smell
is
of
water
and
very
faint
coffee
beans
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
smell
imagine
dropping
two
coffee
beans
into
a
gallon
of
water
and
youve
pretty
much
got
the
taste
of
this
brew
down
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
but
water
with
an
even
lesser
extent
of
the
coffee
coming
through
overall
i
was
extremely
disappointed
in
this
beer
this
is
not
a
stout
in
any
way
shape
or
form
its
9
parts
water
and
1
part
light
coffee
ok
for
a
session
beer
but
its
not
something
you
want
to
reflect
on
o
this
fine
looking
and
wellrespected
beer
struggles
to
rise
above
average
cheers
lampertland
although
guinness
has
a
creamy
thick
mouth
feel
it
really
doesnt
have
many
calories
or
a
high
abv
guinness
isnt
my
favorite
beer
to
just
sip
at
a
bar
but
its
great
when
eating
food
it
is
disappointingly
light
for
its
style
but
still
enjoyable
its
not
as
heavy
as
you
think
nor
as
dark
it
is
the
prototypical
stout
its
a
thing
of
beauty

cheers
overall
this
is
one

its

and
overall
a
damn
good
beer
i
dont
think
you
can
ever
go
wrong
with
any
guinness
product
it
is
well
crafted
however
but
as
much
as
guiness
seemed
to
be
the
pinaccle
of
beers
while
i
was
still
drinking
starter
brews
like
michelob
it
now
seems
like
more
of
an
appetizer
for
more
complex
selections
like
dark
depths
or
art
of
darkness
finally
got
to
try
this
on
nitrotap
but
i
have
to
say
that
even
that
was
disappointing
why
this
pub
draught
stuff
has
surpassed
the
regular
extra
stout
in
popularity
is
beyond
me
because
theres
no
comparison
in
my
view
even
on
nitro
it
was
equally
unimpressive
other
than
the
look
and
the
lasting
creamy
head
but
the
body
was
still
watery
and
the
finish
disappointing
taste
hadnt
changed
the
usual
suspects
for
a
dry
stout
coffee
roasty
a
bit
nutty
perhaps
stick
with
the
regular
extra
stout
or
the
foreign
export
stout
original
review
on
08192010
overall
well
i
hate
coffee
but
im
not
gonna
penalize
the
beer
because
of
that
i
know
this
is
good
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
a
simple
humptydumpty
irish
dry
stout
with
loads
of
character
but
not
many
can
explain
why
a
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
drinking
for
those
who
dont
give
two
hoots
about
the
style
or
the
historical
butchering
of
the
recipe
over
the
years
a
beer
to
scoff
at
for
those
who
have
had
better
dry
stouts
tough
to
love
for
those
who
have
had
north
coast
old
38
victory
donnybrook
beamish
or
murphys
tough
love
is
gods
love
i
suppose
and
for
a
man
who
has
had
all
of
the
aforementioned
brews
i
can
only
exclaim
my
goodness
my
guinness
cmon
if
you
dont
know
what
this
is
youve
got
no
business
venturing
off
into
the
better
options
out
there
guinness
is
irish
dry
stout
guinness
is
the
import
on
nitro
guinness
is
a
classic
but
the
truth
is
guinness
is
nothing
special
and
certainly
not
worth
the
5
a
pint
some
bars
charge
its
a
oneanddoneandthankyou
with
a
smile
or
a
fallback
and
nothing
else
when
in
doubt
have
a
guinness
3
5
overall
never
been
a
fan
personally
i
dont
often
buy
this
but
it
camebin
the
varity
pack
overall
worths
every
penny
overall
the
americanized
guinness
gets
a
lot
of
flack
and
when
compared
to
its
sister
guinnesses
deservedly
so
that
said
it
stacks
up
fairly
well
to
the
average
microbrew
irish
dry
stout
m
more
refreshing
due
too
the
light
body
ending
is
short
and
as
flavor
is
not
intense
as
expected
o
despite
being
very
lacking
in
all
aspects
other
than
its
looks
this
is
at
least
quite
drinkable
in
the
right
setting
even
still
id
have
to
be
in
the
proper
mood
for
another
if
at
all
i
think
my
tastes
have
changed
big
time
overall
a
decent
classic
irish
stout
by
guinness
i
like
to
pick
up
one
of
these
once
in
a
while
but
not
my
first
pick
incredibly
beautiful
appearance
as
it
pours
not
a
fan
of
the
wateriness
in
flavour
and
mouthfeel
but
otherwise
a
good
goto
poured
a
dark
color
with
a
creamy
head
which
looks
like
a
big
cinnamon
colored
marshmellow
not
much
going
on
in
terms
of
smell
microscopic
hints
of
chocolate
a
small
hint
of
malts
and
thats
about
it
taste
was
very
blan
some
malts
and
a
weak
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
was
the
closest
beer
there
is
compared
to
water
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
oily
mouthfeel
afterwards
for
some
reason
i
believe
this
beer
is
definately
made
more
for
the
average
drinker
so
in
that
perspective
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
am
not
a
fan
but
i
was
not
let
down
will
i
buy
this
in
a
4
pack
or
even
single
naa
will
i
drink
it
if
a
buddy
offers
it
definately
plastic
cup
full
of
foam
eventually
settles
into
a
dark
brown
body
with
ruby
highlights
a
coating
of
foam
is
left
all
the
way
down
the
glass
nose
and
taste
are
pretty
similiar
some
roasted
malts
and
a
lactic
smell
and
taste
mouthfeel
is
slightly
light
and
creamy
overly
carbonated
not
a
bad
stout
but
there
are
plenty
better
ones
out
there
i
will
still
order
this
when
there
is
nothing
else
but
bmc
overall
a
terrible
brew
i
had
a
debate
with
my
friends
if
mgd
was
better
which
is
sad
i
dont
see
what
guinness
is
getting
at
here
i
was
thinking
beer
for
the
masses
but
this
was
just
like
a
soda
water
i
wish
i
had
ordered
a
san
pelligrino
instead
guinness
is
the
benchmark
for
the
irish
dry
stout
style
and
shouldnt
be
compared
to
a
russian
imperial
that
should
be
obvious
enough
but
some
of
the
reviews
here
give
me
pause
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
the
style
as
a
whole
isnt
particularly
fullflavored
or
exciting
stophatingonclassics
o
a
classic
and
a
beer
i
have
been
enjoying
for
20
years
very
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
and
very
enjoyable
o
this
was
a
beer
i
loved
before
i
started
drinking
craft
beers
and
stronger
more
intense
beers
now
it
just
tastes
surprisingly
thin
and
light
not
bad
but
nothing
very
exciting
either
o
the
session
stout
that
everyone
claims
is
so
thick
and
a
meal
in
itself
well
good
people
these
are
all
just
myths
theres
a
reason
why
irish
people
drink
these
all
day
because
they
can
they
have
a
low
abv
the
same
as
miller
lite
and
are
highly
drinkable
although
very
bland
in
flavor
nothing
has
the
flat
black
appearance
of
guinness
on
tap
nothing
drinks
better
in
the
morning
try
it
always
a
classic
like
budweiser
to
a
bum
guinness
will
always
be
one
of
the
staples
of
a
dark
beer
drinking
bum
with
that
said
enjoy
when
on
tap
especially
if
the
other
choices
are
bud
bud
light
coors
light
shock
top
blue
moon
sam
adams
heineken
new
castle
and
stella
guinness
please
o
i
tried
to
review
this
like
it
was
my
first
time
having
it
although
ive
had
many
before
i
actually
used
to
hate
this
beer
in
my
younger
age
but
now
that
i
respect
all
styles
i
enjoy
it
whenever
its
the
only
good
thing
on
tap
at
whatever
bar
with
lame
selection
i
happen
to
patron
that
said
my
only
qualm
with
it
is
that
its
a
bit
low
of
an
abv
for
a
beer
with
so
much
flavor
basically
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
the
main
attraction
imo
overall
not
sure
if
i
poured
it
correctly
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
head
and
aroma
from
a
worldclass
brand
have
had
much
better
microbrew
stouts
in
my
opinion
but
i
will
keep
trying
it
when
available
to
see
if
i
cant
grow
more
of
a
liking
to
it
m
if
not
for
anything
else
i
love
this
beer
because
of
the
incredibly
smoothness
and
drinkability
especially
with
the
nitro
cansbottles
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
but
again
any
thicker
and
it
just
wouldnt
be
guinness
ultra
fine
bubbles
of
carbonation
dance
off
the
tongue
but
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
already
delicate
flavor
i
say
delicate
in
reference
to
most
american
craft
breweries
stouts
finish
is
silky
smooth
with
a
hint
of
stickiness
overall
a
nice
flavorful
stout
that
is
much
more
palletable
for
beginner
stout
drinkers
than
the
extra
which
is
more
bitter
and
hoppy
overall
guinness
brew
fantastic
stout
in
guinness
extra
stout
and
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
yet
this
particular
brew
was
unstimulating
and
not
at
all
exciting
for
me
its
presentation
and
drinkability
are
probably
what
keeps
this
stuff
flowing
in
the
bars
but
for
a
great
tasting
irish
stout
i
would
certainly
recommend
trying
one
of
their
other
brews
above
otherwise
beamish
and
murphys
are
both
popular
brands
to
find
on
tap
and
either
would
appeal
to
me
more
o
i
like
it
better
on
draft
for
a
mass
produced
beer
its
a
great
change
of
pace
remarkable
consitent
and
apperance
is
pretty
awesome
good
beer
to
use
to
get
macro
drinkers
to
change
it
up
ill
have
some
every
st
pattys
great
a
smitwicks
for
a
black
n
tan
or
make
2
carbombs
for
yourself
and
a
buddy
this
pairs
well
with
beef
dishes
stews
it
isnt
my
favorite
stout
but
it
is
a
decent
drink
o
horrible
takes
any
redeeming
qualities
of
the
guinness
brand
and
made
it
watery
othis
is
a
very
average
stout
this
is
one
i
can
almost
always
count
on
any
bar
having
and
is
never
bad
also
great
when
you
dont
want
anything
to
overpowering
but
still
want
the
stout
experience
i
feel
like
guinness
could
really
add
some
more
flavor
and
maybe
less
water
and
this
one
would
be
significantly
better
o
guinness
is
good
for
you
sláinte
sláinte
overall
this
is
a
classic
stout
and
its
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
the
low
abv
is
a
delight
dont
let
the
low
reviews
of
the
draught
pub
can
fool
you
this
beer
on
tap
in
ireland
is
absolutely
fantastic
great
session
beer
oill
stick
to
this
when
its
on
tap
oi
think
the
look
of
guinness
is
what
makes
it
appetizing
the
beer
itself
isnt
that
great
but
it
draws
you
in
with
the
appearance
c
very
dark
brown
with
glints
of
red
very
creamy
foam
head
that
causes
this
beer
to
be
picture
perfect
however
this
beer
is
so
thin
flat
and
burnt
that
ive
wondered
for
years
what
people
are
possessed
by
when
they
choose
to
spend
their
money
on
this
poor
excuse
for
a
stout
one
advantage
is
its
drinkability
ive
often
likened
it
to
water
into
which
someone
spilled
their
ashtray
but
water
nonetheless
hence
easydrinking
id
like
to
think
that
any
selfrespecting
beer
enthusiast
wouldnt
be
caught
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
most
obscure
bar
drinking
this
swill
im
quite
disappointed
in
my
irish
half
having
been
to
the
guiness
brewery
and
virtually
every
pub
large
and
small
around
the
coastal
areas
of
ireland
i
know
that
guiness
isnt
just
some
garbage
made
popular
by
american
advertising
like
samuel
adams
wasthe
irish
really
have
a
lot
of
pride
in
this
so
called
stout
but
just
to
put
things
into
context
miller
genuine
draft
and
budweisier
was
one
euro
more
per
pint
than
guiness
at
every
pub
in
which
i
had
the
honor
to
visit
that
speaks
to
me
you
make
youre
own
judgement
felt
obligated
to
drink
it
on
st
patricks
day
otherwise
youd
never
have
seen
this
review
o
better
on
tap
than
out
of
the
can
but
regardless
for
the
price
this
is
an
overrated
beer
there
are
far
better
irish
dry
stouts
available
im
willing
to
drink
this
at
a
bar
that
serves
bmc
and
guinness
but
never
something
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
for
o
i
like
this
and
prefer
it
on
tap
the
nitro
can
is
no
comparison
to
the
tap
version
sure
its
no
ris
but
its
still
a
classic
slainte
i
was
hesistant
to
review
guinness
without
the
widget
i
felt
it
wouldnt
be
an
accurate
representation
of
the
beer
this
experiment
which
has
left
the
guinness
bottles
without
their
now
familiar
widgets
although
after
reviewing
it
i
realize
looking
back
it
will
be
more
unique
perhaps
a
time
where
to
widget
or
not
to
widget
was
indeed
a
the
question
could
these
little
guys
be
no
more
who
knows
all
i
know
is
i
totally
realized
how
much
i
had
been
playing
hard
to
get
with
my
love
for
this
beer
it
really
is
all
you
could
ask
for
in
a
brew
a
nectar
of
the
gods
o
i
still
enjoy
a
properly
poured
pint
of
the
black
stuff
you
can
find
other
stouts
with
quite
a
bit
more
aroma
flavor
and
body
but
this
is
still
a
classic
o
guinness
kills
you
with
looks
and
with
the
price
you
pay
for
it
on
tap
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
generated
by
the
die
hard
guinness
fans
and
average
beer
drinkers
i
know
its
watery
but
its
still
good
very
roasted
malt
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
very
light
body
if
this
were
brewed
in
the
us
it
would
be
an
american
black
aleschwarzbier
clean
finish
that
leads
to
a
slightly
chewy
malt
those
roasted
malts
are
the
facade
that
fades
into
a
soapy
feeling
overall
its
a
commonly
available
stout
thats
not
ridiculously
priced
very
average
but
its
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
enjoy
every
once
in
a
while
see
ya
on
the
next
one
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
light
irish
dry
stout
i
think
it
is
classic
for
a
reason
they
make
a
great
brew
at
a
reasonable
price
well
done
guiness
overall
a
good
appearence
and
smell
but
not
well
rounded
with
all
that
watery
sensation
o
not
worth
the
time
very
very
faint
flavors
and
aromas
artificial
at
times
and
muted
by
the
nitro
pour
in
my
opinion
sometimes
i
feel
like
having
slightly
more
coffee
grounds
bitterness
in
my
stout
and
that
is
when
i
have
a
murphys
when
i
want
more
emphasis
on
the
sweetness
of
a
roasted
malt
i
drink
a
guinness
admittedly
it
seems
as
though
guinness
has
been
nerfed
as
of
lately
in
the
us
it
doesnt
have
quite
as
bold
an
aroma
or
flavor
as
i
remember
it
having
in
my
college
days
well
either
that
or
nostalgia
is
playing
tricks
with
my
memories
im
not
really
sure
overall
biggest
irish
dry
stout
out
there
just
wish
it
was
a
little
less
costly
draught
is
what
turned
me
onto
beer
not
knowing
anything
of
the
craft
brewing
culture
one
of
guinness
lower
rated
stouts
but
overall
a
great
memory
its
black
and
very
frothy
a
more
subtle
malt
flavor
then
it
used
to
be
it
seems
hard
to
stop
drinking
it
though
once
you
start
it
goes
down
so
smooth
the
14
9
ounces
is
gone
before
you
realize
it
an
uninteresting
dry
stout
color
beer
is
a
dark
brown
almost
black
its
a
light
beer
nitro
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
deep
amber
with
purple
on
the
edges
minimal
tan
head
with
little
retnetion
nose
is
bland
maybe
some
light
roast
taste
is
black
coffee
roastiness
with
slight
very
faint
flower
a
bit
of
chalk
mouth
is
light
bodied
and
deffiantly
sessionable
overall
not
completly
horrific
when
confronted
with
only
bmc
competitors
this
beer
is
an
irish
dry
stout
and
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
in
the
market
the
smell
was
a
mix
of
malt
and
barley
texture
and
mouth
feel
was
slightly
watery
but
overall
smooth
in
texture
this
beer
retains
a
full
head
on
the
glass
when
poured
overall
i
thank
you
guinness
i
was
first
introduced
this
back
in
high
school
in
the
late
90s
and
will
never
forget
my
first
glass
this
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
love
but
compared
to
what
else
is
out
on
the
market
it
is
mediocre
at
best
but
compared
to
who
makes
a
better
irish
dry
stout
dont
bother
looking
else
where
salud
i
think
this
beer
was
average
the
taste
was
not
bad
but
it
was
nothing
amazing
it
tasted
watery
and
did
not
have
a
big
mouthfeel
it
has
a
nice
very
dark
color
with
a
medium
head
there
was
not
a
strong
smell
compared
to
something
you
would
get
with
a
lot
of
hops
in
it
it
also
has
a
strong
hold
on
the
glass
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
the
color
is
a
creamy
and
dark
chocolatey
color
the
aroma
is
of
a
roasty
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
like
drinking
water
almost
you
would
think
that
because
it
is
so
dark
it
would
be
thick
like
a
porter
but
it
is
not
it
is
creamy
with
a
nice
strong
head
on
it
watery
with
no
had
to
get
the
phones
still
sensitive
toppenish
euporia
up
the
phone
disappears
and
you
can
see
the
dark
color
of
the
beer
has
a
soya
sauce
the
maltese
smell
too
late
and
taste
kind
of
carmalee
maybe
even
a
little
chocolate
he
smells
cream
mean
the
head
is
as
well
very
creamy
hence
the
term
water
and
is
that
a
stronghold
on
the
glass
even
know
what
is
water
o
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
with
its
head
retention
and
its
tan
cascade
immediately
after
the
pour
the
flavors
are
a
little
bland
could
be
much
richer
very
light
and
smooth
drinkable
stout
but
the
flavor
is
just
too
bland
the
iron
aftertaste
is
a
little
strange
but
definitely
gives
a
little
logic
to
the
old
myth
of
guinness
being
a
good
iron
supplement
for
pregnant
women
not
a
good
idea
ha
m
medium
body
creamy
light
carbonation
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
somewhat
bland
flavors
and
aromas
o
a
lackluster
beer
it
seems
to
be
guinness
for
people
who
dont
really
like
stout
i
guess
i
would
drink
it
again
if
thats
all
that
was
available
but
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
got
to
review
this
classic
the
appearance
is
great
dark
ruby
red
with
a
cascading
effect
topped
with
a
creamy
white
head
great
white
lacing
smell
is
minimal
maybe
some
roasty
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
of
watery
chocolate
grains
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
not
too
bad
for
a
nitrostout
but
id
prefer
a
murphys
any
day
o
this
ones
a
classic
nothing
is
spectacular
about
the
taste
or
the
smell
but
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
very
satisfying
o
a
standard
a
classic
i
cant
say
anything
bad
about
this
beer
it
is
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
that
i
started
with
since
i
would
say
that
my
palate
has
evolved
a
bit
but
this
is
still
a
nice
beer
to
drink
i
would
never
turn
down
a
guinness
either
by
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
or
by
the
yard
but
nos
always
makes
this
beer
better
i
dont
care
what
you
say
i
love
a
good
nitro
tapped
guinness
it
was
the
first
beer
ive
ever
had
and
probably
the
beer
that
turned
me
on
to
craft
beer
its
black
with
a
thick
creamy
head
doesnt
smell
like
much
but
there
are
hints
of
smokiness
detectable
tastes
chocolatey
and
roastey
and
a
little
nutty
and
its
very
silky
perfect
with
some
wings
or
pizza
or
as
a
session
beer
at
a
crappy
bar
with
tons
of
miller
and
coors
products
available
overall
this
was
o
k
glad
we
have
this
as
an
option
in
mississippi
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
overall
not
too
impressive
hard
to
compare
this
to
the
draft
version
and
not
as
good
as
many
american
craft
brewed
examples
of
the
style
o
not
complex
by
any
means
still
any
enjoyable
beer
and
a
great
intro
for
those
wanting
to
try
a
stout
when
you
do
step
up
try
a
siberian
night
imperial
by
thirsty
dog
its
an
excellent
beer
the
beer
poured
up
dark
with
a
nice
looking
head
full
of
promise
after
admiring
the
beer
i
took
a
sip
and
was
immediately
disappointed
maybe
it
was
because
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
like
the
other
stouts
ive
tried
but
it
just
tasted
weak
and
watered
down
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
unfortunately
this
beer
was
a
disappointment
this
beer
isnt
very
good
i
never
buy
it
and
i
am
glad
my
brother
enjoys
these
buys
i
never
buy
because
i
can
steal
a
bottle
and
give
it
a
review
it
is
nice
and
light
and
refreshing
though
the
orignal
and
most
famous
for
a
reason
this
is
the
original
dry
irish
stout
pours
nearly
black
thick
frothy
mocha
head
smells
roasty
and
smooth
ever
slight
milk
chocolate
characteristics
tastes
great
creamy
and
a
little
bitter
at
the
finish
full
bodied
but
so
smooth
and
low
alcohol
that
you
can
easily
drink
it
all
day
not
the
best
stout
in
the
world
not
even
close
but
when
you
are
at
a
pub
and
the
choices
are
bud
bud
light
heineken
and
guinness
its
the
only
choice
also
nice
on
a
hangover
i
was
expecting
a
good
stout
as
ive
drunken
in
england
but
this
guinness
was
very
disappointing
the
nitrocan
creates
a
nice
creamy
head
but
once
i
forgot
the
appearance
nothing
is
worth
buying
this
stout
just
one
word
watery
not
tasty
at
all
just
pass
your
way
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
malty
stout
works
well
with
seafood
starters
imho
as
had
last
nights
serving
with
some
smoked
mussels
which
it
complimented
well
as
a
beer
without
any
discernibly
strong
flavours
con
it
kind
of
feels
like
light
beer
watery
and
lacking
abundant
flavor
not
for
my
personal
taste
overall
i
am
shocked
how
little
the
overall
flavor
in
this
to
get
a
b
but
assume
that
its
pretty
light
flavors
and
thin
watery
body
that
make
it
such
a
world
wide
stout
i
personally
will
only
pick
up
the
extra
stout
or
foreign
extra
stout
from
now
on
m
medium
bodied
loved
the
low
carbonation
was
extremely
smooth
and
refreshing
o
sure
this
is
not
the
most
flavourful
or
complex
stout
out
there
but
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
pleasantly
refreshing
which
is
great
to
be
found
in
a
stout
overall
a
simple
nice
beer
overall
goodtogreat
itll
remain
a
favorite
for
the
foreseeable
future
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
runs
in
my
blood
so
its
hard
to
knock
this
one
yes
i
would
have
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
ruby
hues
there
is
a
big
creamy
2finger
offwhite
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
incredible
retention
and
it
leaves
behind
a
big
coating
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
pretty
light
there
are
some
weak
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
as
some
nuttiness
there
really
isnt
much
going
on
here
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
light
roasted
malts
and
some
faint
notes
of
black
coffee
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
there
is
some
burnt
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
this
is
just
a
pretty
weak
flavor
overall
this
has
a
pretty
light
body
especially
for
a
stout
and
creamy
carbonation
there
is
some
bitterness
and
some
sweetness
as
well
i
think
the
creamy
layer
of
foam
on
top
is
the
only
thing
that
saved
the
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
here
isnt
so
good
it
goes
down
really
easy
but
it
is
definitely
lacking
in
the
taste
and
smell
there
just
isnt
much
going
on
and
the
flavors
and
aromas
seem
quite
muted
i
really
just
expect
a
whole
lot
more
in
a
stout
this
beer
just
really
isnt
worth
the
money
you
can
get
a
much
better
6pack
of
a
nice
craft
stout
for
the
same
amount
of
money
i
recommend
going
the
second
route
o
one
of
the
most
commonly
seen
beers
in
existence
often
the
best
you
can
get
on
a
less
wellassorted
pub
given
you
like
stout
nobody
is
ever
going
to
confuse
this
one
with
darkness
or
dark
lord
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
wager
many
of
those
same
fans
of
the
big
boys
of
stouts
started
their
love
affair
with
this
one
i
for
one
can
say
i
was
one
of
those
people
overall
the
king
of
the
dry
stout
in
my
opinion
but
only
when
served
here
in
its
homeland
the
nitrocancrap
they
serve
in
the
us
forget
it
for
example
should
sierra
nevada
ever
start
exporting
to
europe
you
can
bet
id
pass
it
by
every
time
the
pasteurization
really
kills
the
beer
if
youre
fortunate
enough
to
try
one
here
its
really
another
beer
entirely
and
quite
a
good
one
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
say
that
because
the
guinness
extra
stout
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
and
i
love
that
one
so
much
that
i
cannot
give
the
draught
the
best
review
because
it
seems
like
a
beer
with
half
the
character
of
the
imported
extra
stout
it
is
nice
though
if
you
are
one
who
is
not
into
stouts
or
coffeechocolate
beers
like
the
extra
stout
this
is
definitely
for
you
if
you
are
getting
into
the
stouts
try
this
first
if
you
like
this
then
get
into
the
darker
stronger
more
coffeeish
and
chocolaty
beers
i
probably
will
not
drink
this
again
when
i
can
drink
the
amazing
guinness
imported
extra
stout
i
have
always
liked
this
beer
and
still
think
it
is
pretty
decent
there
are
better
irish
stouts
out
there
but
i
will
always
come
back
to
this
one
overall
ill
never
drink
this
beer
again
anyway
because
they
use
meat
in
the
process
so
i
hear
this
beer
has
earned
top
shelf
in
my
fridge
and
has
become
my
goto
beer
i
am
certain
you
will
like
it
i
am
just
a
guy
who
likes
good
beer
like
most
of
you
i
think
we
all
can
and
should
agree
with
me
on
this
one
it
deserves
an
a
o
it
was
the
best
choice
where
i
was
but
that
doesnt
make
it
great
might
drink
it
again
if
it
was
the
best
choice
but
then
again
i
might
just
go
water
overall
youve
got
to
respect
it
for
being
better
than
the
garbage
that
is
usually
available
but
guinness
is
no
great
stout
its
just
weak
and
lazy
i
did
an
experiment
with
guinness
a
while
ago
and
that
can
be
seen
here
httpbeeradvocate
comforumread3601215
otherwise
guinness
is
for
now
most
of
our
only
other
option
beer
it
is
what
it
is
the
flavors
are
also
light
watery
roasted
malts
primarily
the
body
of
this
beer
is
disappointing
compared
to
the
nitro
version
which
adds
some
creaminess
and
body
to
help
it
out
there
really
is
no
favorable
characteristics
to
this
version
only
drink
the
nitro
version
overall
you
get
what
you
expect
and
i
guess
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
sampled
on
november
8
2011
the
pour
is
a
well
carbonated
dark
amber
to
brown
with
a
generous
longlasting
foamy
head
aroma
of
nutty
malts
and
molasses
the
body
falls
into
the
light
to
medium
range
but
it
stays
together
while
swirling
the
taste
is
sweetly
malted
and
dryly
hopped
i
have
had
this
in
the
nitro
can
and
the
bottle
and
i
think
i
prefer
it
from
the
nitro
can
one
thing
that
you
can
say
is
that
it
is
always
the
same
no
matter
when
or
where
you
buy
it
and
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
consistancy
o
everyone
says
its
like
drinking
a
loaf
of
bread
and
i
used
to
be
one
of
them
that
was
before
i
got
into
the
heavier
riss
that
ie
fallen
in
love
with
a
nice
beer
to
order
at
an
irish
pub
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
one
again
overall
this
stout
will
do
in
a
pinch
but
not
in
my
top
10
o
back
before
i
discovered
craft
beer
guiness
was
craft
beer
though
this
doesnt
stack
up
to
other
mighty
stouts
of
the
style
its
still
easy
drinking
and
decent
if
i
catch
myself
in
local
dive
watering
holes
this
is
what
ill
order
o
i
like
this
a
lot
more
on
tap
when
its
done
right
still
when
my
dad
comes
over
and
ive
to
get
him
some
guinness
i
have
no
issues
finishing
off
whatever
cans
are
left
behind
serving
type
bottle
o
what
can
i
say
i
love
a
good
guinness
as
much
as
i
enjoy
the
bottled
variety
ive
had
enough
of
this
on
tap
to
know
its
even
better
live
its
a
masterpiece
through
and
through
and
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
as
long
as
the
world
turns
in
fact
if
the
world
does
stop
turning
ill
probably
choose
a
guinness
to
see
the
world
off
with
what
can
you
say
the
creamy
head
and
lacing
that
covers
my
entire
glass
is
the
king
of
suds
nose
has
a
nutlike
scent
and
taste
is
burnt
carbonation
is
absent
if
it
had
more
bubbles
i
call
it
the
best
import
session
beer
a
nice
treat
but
wouldnt
keep
it
in
the
fridge
o
love
me
some
foreign
export
stout
this
guy
not
so
much
o
i
like
it
and
its
cheap
and
drinkable
but
obviously
doesnt
stand
up
to
any
real
stouts
from
founders
victory
or
bells
just
to
name
a
few
o
cheap
and
easy
to
drink
actually
pairs
quite
nicely
with
a
lot
of
black
and
combinations
that
ive
had
black
and
white
allagash
blaxter
guinness
on
baxter
pale
etc
o
goes
down
easy
but
not
particularly
enjoyable
not
bad
for
cheap
but
not
any
kind
of
standard
either
o
a
beer
that
will
never
blow
me
away
but
will
never
dissapoint
either
very
good
actually
one
i
will
definitely
drink
again
and
again
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
the
taste
was
my
favorite
part
the
scent
was
pretty
good
but
needs
to
be
a
bit
stronger
a
heavier
mouthfeel
would
make
this
beer
seem
bolder
and
more
substantial
overall
though
im
happy
i
tried
it
ill
probably
buy
it
again
its
certainly
worth
a
try
this
version
of
guinness
is
thin
but
drinkable
taste
is
little
to
none
this
one
has
a
better
feel
than
taste
it
has
a
creamy
smooth
mouth
feel
reminiscent
of
chocolate
taste
is
almost
watery
followed
by
a
slight
creamy
malt
finishing
dry
with
bitter
herb
notes
d
this
is
a
fairly
mild
stout
in
both
alcohol
and
flavor
but
id
happily
have
a
few
and
be
amazed
with
the
beauty
of
the
pour
every
time
overalll
guinness
is
simply
a
5star
brew
that
ill
likely
never
say
no
to
i
order
one
at
least
one
any
night
i
go
out
drinking
ive
heard
the
north
american
guinness
is
inferior
to
the
genuine
irish
product
and
that
what
we
get
is
actually
guinness
essence
that
is
mixed
somehow
with
inferior
base
ingredients
even
assuming
this
is
true
we
have
not
gotten
the
shaft
guinness
on
draft
is
still
the
beer
to
beat
however
i
dont
care
for
it
as
much
in
canned
form
the
beer
is
dependent
on
the
proper
pour
its
not
surprising
that
a
runofthemill
product
like
this
fail
to
impress
although
it
pours
rich
and
creamy
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
rest
of
the
experience
leaves
much
to
be
desired
no
smell
noted
with
a
very
thin
feel
that
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
standard
american
light
beer
if
not
for
the
appearance
you
might
as
well
be
drinking
coors
light
or
bud
light
its
pretty
tough
to
taste
the
difference
although
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamier
if
you
really
concentrate
overall
id
drink
this
over
a
standard
light
beer
but
its
in
the
same
ballpark
pretty
shabby
ive
had
guiness
before
from
sipping
other
peoples
beers
but
i
finally
had
the
chance
to
have
a
full
glass
of
my
own
what
a
disappointment
i
would
compare
this
beer
to
being
the
budweiser
or
bud
light
of
regular
beers
except
for
stouts
it
is
very
uncomplex
no
hoppiness
and
tastes
fairly
close
to
water
mind
you
i
did
have
this
in
the
u
s
and
i
hear
it
tastes
different
across
the
pond
i
just
didnt
expect
such
a
lack
of
flavor
o
smooth
refreshing
dry
stout
with
a
very
predictable
taste
o
i
know
on
this
site
this
beer
doesnt
get
great
reviews
but
man
it
is
very
tasty
to
me
i
find
it
to
be
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
easy
to
find
this
isnt
the
best
stout
on
the
market
at
all
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
o
overall
an
ok
beer
overall
a
decent
session
beer
for
the
mild
stout
lovers
i
could
easily
have
a
half
a
dozen
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
worrying
about
the
abv
since
it
is
so
low
i
would
much
rather
have
a
guinness
before
any
of
the
other
massmarketed
light
beers
out
there
all
in
all
if
you
dont
want
budweiser
or
coors
light
or
miller
lite
this
is
definitely
a
welcome
beer
o
sessionable
to
an
extent
a
good
choice
at
a
bar
that
doesnt
have
anything
other
than
bcab
im
not
sure
which
has
changed
me
or
this
beer
but
its
probably
both
my
fond
memories
of
this
brew
dont
draw
it
in
such
a
bland
and
watery
light
im
really
disappointed
this
took
such
a
nose
dive
in
the
quality
department
but
i
suppose
its
good
to
have
at
bars
that
have
no
better
options
the
last
bad
beer
i
tried
is
budweiser
king
of
beer
although
bad
i
can
still
manage
to
finish
the
whole
can
this
guinness
is
definitely
not
something
i
want
to
even
touch
in
the
future
o
a
classic
and
iconic
beer
that
doesnt
seem
as
great
once
your
palate
developes
a
bit
there
are
many
better
irish
dry
stouts
but
still
not
a
bad
dry
stout
d
a
classic
always
good
but
probably
could
have
been
served
a
bit
better
tonight
when
everything
else
on
tap
is
fizzy
and
yellow
i
know
what
im
getting
pours
black
w
chocolate
head
that
quickly
goes
away
minimal
carbonation
and
lacing
guinness
draught
smells
fairly
thin
w
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
bitter
coffee
taste
is
even
thinner
w
the
same
flavor
as
the
nose
profile
mouthfeel
is
super
thin
and
probably
the
weakest
part
of
this
beer
pretty
dry
as
well
overall
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
to
anyway
lots
of
better
options
out
there
for
the
style
cheers
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
classic
i
like
the
other
stout
offerings
from
guinness
better
o
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
it
is
better
on
tap
then
from
the
can
not
my
first
choice
of
brew
for
this
style
but
it
is
somewhat
enjoyable
in
a
pinch
this
baby
just
begs
for
a
nose
and
flavor
that
matches
the
imposing
and
impressive
look
of
the
beer
without
any
back
bone
at
best
its
a
beer
you
could
turn
to
after
youve
had
some
of
the
stouts
that
are
worthy
of
the
reverence
that
guiness
wishes
it
deserved
o
when
guinness
is
fresh
on
tap
it
is
spoton
as
they
say
it
is
an
original
to
which
all
others
are
compared
to
common
in
most
pubs
in
england
you
really
need
to
have
a
particular
craving
and
style
to
enjoy
this
it
sees
like
a
beer
that
many
people
either
love
or
hate
i
am
on
the
fence
and
would
probably
only
order
it
on
st
patricks
day
the
taste
just
seems
somewhat
boring
to
me
and
not
very
great
regardless
the
beer
is
one
of
the
best
went
it
comes
to
appearance
the
name
color
and
head
give
it
a
very
distinguishing
look
that
makes
drinkers
look
sophisticated
the
appearance
and
name
is
the
only
reason
why
i
would
ever
drink
it
o
the
quiticential
stout
honestly
this
is
great
out
of
the
nitrogenated
can
i
was
really
skeptical
that
it
wouldnt
be
like
the
real
draft
but
it
is
just
like
im
sitting
in
my
local
favorite
bar
except
im
at
home
in
my
underwear
final
grade
3
08
a
c
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
dry
light
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
roasted
malt
and
some
chocolate
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
where
i
really
have
a
problem
with
the
beer
i
am
not
a
fan
of
nitro
beers
which
almost
always
taste
watered
down
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
o
guinness
is
a
great
stout
for
those
willing
to
try
a
heavier
beer
than
they
would
normally
enjoy
not
too
harsh
not
a
ton
of
alcohol
just
a
smooth
easy
drinking
stout
w
a
cool
nitro
cartridge
in
the
can
for
extra
head
i
recommend
it
overall
i
know
my
scores
suggest
i
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
do
i
buy
and
drink
it
because
everyone
i
know
likes
this
beer
i
think
its
light
a
stout
should
not
be
sessionable
thats
just
my
opinion
and
what
is
more
sessionable
than
4
2
abv
i
say
a
stout
should
be
a
meal
in
a
glass
the
old
liquid
bread
this
is
not
liquid
bread
o
i
dont
know
why
guinness
draught
gets
such
bad
reviews
maybe
because
there
are
many
great
craft
brewers
in
this
day
and
time
guinness
is
everywhere
and
most
of
the
great
brewers
arent
as
readily
available
im
not
sure
but
guinness
is
a
solid
brew
i
drink
it
on
a
the
regular
here
and
when
i
travel
to
the
u
k
sure
there
are
better
but
guinnes
always
brings
a
lovely
experience
plus
you
can
get
it
literally
anywhere
pours
very
dark
with
nice
head
tastes
like
roasted
coffee
and
malts
very
creamy
and
smooth
and
hardly
any
carbonation
filling
almost
like
drinking
a
liquid
meal
not
bad
at
all
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
nitrogenated
brews
and
this
one
just
comes
off
a
bit
dull
to
me
o
not
ones
of
my
favorites
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
i
would
choose
it
over
a
bud
or
miller
but
over
any
decent
craft
brew
what
is
going
on
with
this
maybe
i
got
the
product
from
guinness
somalia
instead
barely
drinkable
air
has
more
flavor
water
tastes
better
at
least
water
doesnt
have
this
terrible
metallic
aftertaste
probably
what
a
dung
beetle
would
use
to
wash
the
dust
down
his
little
throat
its
that
nasty
can
has
the
newer
big
golden
harp
thanks
to
diageo
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
or
taste
but
hey
after
all
it
is
a
session
beer
a
dry
stout
so
a
clear
example
of
the
style
perhaps
it
lacks
a
little
than
other
examples
but
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
think
as
far
as
irish
drys
go
this
stuff
is
just
ok
it
does
not
even
come
close
to
something
with
flavor
and
texture
like
guinness
extra
stout
probably
still
the
best
draught
style
irish
dry
out
there
i
think
im
just
biased
and
like
my
stouts
thick
and
robust
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
though
overall
this
is
still
my
go
to
beer
when
i
dont
feel
like
spendy
a
bunch
of
money
on
beer
i
absolutely
love
this
piece
overall
i
should
try
this
on
tap
and
get
a
better
experience
not
as
bad
as
i
remember
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
either
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
i
would
prefer
this
out
of
the
nitro
can
or
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
just
because
of
taste
alone
and
you
are
not
getting
as
much
from
the
bottle
in
terms
of
ounces
o
ive
always
found
guinness
ontap
to
be
very
refreshing
its
tasty
and
has
a
nice
texture
to
it
its
not
hard
to
understand
why
its
still
a
popular
drink
worldwide
o
this
is
a
solid
irish
dry
stout
its
better
in
the
nitro
can
and
i
prefer
the
extra
stout
over
the
draught
would
love
to
try
the
foreign
extra
someday
not
a
complex
beer
but
very
drinkable
this
was
the
first
dark
beer
i
ever
drank
on
a
semiregular
basis
there
are
many
stouts
i
would
prefer
but
this
is
a
classic
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
guinness
beer
would
definitely
pass
on
this
beer
and
grab
a
different
beer
from
guinness
o
this
is
a
classic
i
have
never
really
liked
it
much
not
a
bad
beer
but
only
good
once
or
twice
annually
o
this
beer
has
very
good
qualities
its
very
light
bodied
taste
mixed
with
the
great
color
and
rustic
smell
make
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
from
the
nitro
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
this
characteristic
because
its
really
artificial
but
it
somehow
works
with
guinness
again
as
in
the
aroma
the
beer
is
really
boring
and
watery
until
it
warms
a
bit
too
often
this
beer
is
served
at
35
degrees
and
loses
all
of
its
flavor
when
it
warms
its
pretty
nice
with
a
decent
amour
of
dry
roasted
malt
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
nut
and
caramel
complimented
by
the
creamy
lactic
feelflavor
dry
finish
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
underrated
possibly
because
of
its
popularity
overall
a
really
decent
stout
nothing
exceptional
but
its
available
at
nearly
every
bar
worth
a
damn
a
handsdownnobrainer
alternative
to
the
bmc
that
is
inevitably
served
beside
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
think
it
is
best
tasting
on
tap
i
will
often
order
this
beer
when
out
as
it
is
one
of
the
few
regulars
at
multiple
places
i
frequent
on
the
weekends
drink
when
you
first
get
into
craft
you
have
a
guinness
its
a
better
than
average
beer
but
one
dimensional
and
a
little
bitter
ill
probably
have
it
again
who
can
say
no
to
an
irish
car
bomb
hadnt
had
a
guinness
in
a
while
and
decided
to
give
it
another
whirl
at
the
bar
last
night
what
can
i
say
it
just
seems
average
to
me
i
didnt
get
that
rush
of
flavors
you
find
with
so
many
of
the
other
stout
offerings
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
think
of
this
beer
as
heavy
well
for
me
i
guess
this
beer
will
just
stay
the
requirement
for
an
irish
car
bomb
and
not
for
regular
consumption
a
good
choice
if
youre
at
a
bar
that
has
nothing
else
of
note
of
all
the
guinness
versions
i
have
tried
though
this
is
probably
the
less
appealing
i
would
skip
the
nitrobottle
and
go
for
a
glass
bottle
can
or
best
of
all
draft
o
very
smooth
it
goes
down
quite
well
and
the
relatively
low
abv
makes
it
easy
to
drink
i
like
it
but
a
lot
of
the
overall
grade
comes
from
the
mystique
of
the
name
d
good
for
that
stout
mood
you
might
get
in
when
the
craft
store
is
closed
overall
not
a
special
beer
in
terms
of
unusual
flavors
aromas
or
appearance
but
its
the
standard
stout
for
a
reason
a
solid
beer
and
a
safe
choice
we
ate
at
a
irish
style
pub
and
i
had
to
try
a
guinness
on
tap
id
had
a
can
and
hated
it
and
this
was
much
better
than
the
can
was
still
not
something
ill
seek
out
possibly
the
stout
with
the
least
roasted
character
ive
ever
tried
o
the
first
time
i
had
a
guinness
i
wasnt
impress
but
i
wasnt
a
beer
drinker
now
a
few
years
and
a
lot
of
beers
later
ive
really
come
to
enjoy
this
brew
a
nice
go
to
beer
that
i
can
have
several
of
and
a
must
have
at
an
irish
restaurant
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
cheers
not
my
first
choice
at
a
bar
but
the
best
out
of
the
big
beer
options
nitro
is
fun
not
being
any
particular
enthusiast
of
irish
dry
stouts
i
recognize
that
i
may
on
the
one
hand
be
biased
towards
sweeter
nonirish
stouts
on
the
other
hand
im
not
enjoying
this
beer
and
it
certainly
doesnt
compare
with
the
few
other
irish
dry
stouts
ive
had
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
guinness
go
for
the
extra
original
ofinally
was
able
to
review
this
beer
and
as
i
remembered
it
was
bland
the
body
is
very
very
light
but
still
brings
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
this
beer
is
amazingly
sessionable
and
will
always
been
a
decent
beer
to
me
o
not
something
im
going
to
pound
back
a
lot
of
but
good
when
im
in
the
mood
the
body
is
rich
creamy
and
smooth
drinkability
is
very
nice
and
easy
overall
theres
a
reason
why
this
beer
is
almost
synonymous
with
stout
youve
had
it
before
go
on
and
have
one
again
o
decent
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
a
good
gateway
beer
for
the
bmc
crowd
but
compared
to
craft
versions
of
stouts
its
bland
if
youre
going
to
have
this
beer
it
better
be
on
nitrotap
or
better
yet
go
with
the
superior
extra
stout
version
creamy
feelwith
a
light
body
typical
from
what
i
would
expec
overall
not
bad
guinness
seems
just
slightly
unimpressive
to
me
a
little
boring
and
bland
but
there
isnt
anything
offensive
here
thanks
love
it
but
sometimes
feel
like
im
slumming
it
when
i
could
be
drinking
better
stouts
o
not
as
good
as
the
extra
stout
for
fes
d
simple
yet
effective
good
session
stout
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
cheers
dare
i
say
it
car
bombs
overall
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
is
light
but
tasty
o
there
are
times
usually
on
a
hot
day
after
eight
hours
of
hard
graft
when
a
pint
of
guinness
is
just
whats
needed
to
hit
the
spot
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
toss
one
back
in
short
order
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
stay
on
it
all
night
years
ago
when
there
werent
so
many
other
good
beers
around
id
stick
to
guinness
for
the
whole
session
but
thats
not
necessary
any
more
when
there
were
only
bland
bitters
and
lagers
on
tap
guinness
was
a
welcome
pint
of
flavour
for
an
ubermass
produced
beer
its
not
bad
really
dont
be
fooled
by
the
color
of
this
beer
it
is
quite
light
and
is
definitely
not
a
meal
in
a
glass
hell
this
beer
goes
down
so
smooth
and
easy
it
makes
for
easy
chugging
in
the
case
of
irish
car
bombs
this
beer
is
just
ok
and
it
often
leaves
me
wanting
something
with
more
flavor
it
is
an
old
time
friend
it
isnt
for
eveyone
i
have
only
had
it
cold
to
pretty
two
finger
head
that
looks
like
light
brown
ice
cream
heavy
lace
covers
the
side
of
the
glass
right
to
the
end
color
is
a
dark
brown
a
38
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
unsweetened
chocolate
coffee
and
malt
taste
is
a
real
disappointment
flavors
are
very
light
almost
nonexistent
coffee
unsweetened
chocolate
and
caramel
are
there
but
very
faint
almost
like
drinking
watered
down
coffee
mouthfeel
is
weak
just
a
step
above
water
wonderful
looking
beer
but
everything
else
is
just
what
happened
i
will
not
even
think
about
trying
another
the
most
impressive
part
was
the
apperance
overall
if
it
were
not
as
flat
as
juice
this
would
be
a
great
beer
but
its
flatness
made
this
almost
undrinkable
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
in
my
mind
easy
to
drink
and
not
over
the
top
cant
complain
though
d
one
of
my
favorites
and
will
definitely
be
remembered
classic
had
this
for
easter
dessert
and
loved
every
sip
of
it
i
recommend
this
other
beerlovers
and
always
have
this
available
in
my
fridge
d
high
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
quaffe
its
light
smooth
and
with
a
nice
roastycreamy
flavor

the
classic
irish
stout
its
a
bit
overrated
in
my
opinion
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
easy
to
drink
could
throw
back
a
couple
no
problem
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
bland
served
at
33
degress
f
on
a
warm
day
this
would
be
a
decent
refresher
the
disappointing
part
is
that
its
clear
guinness
can
brew
a
great
stout
as
evidenced
by
the
foreign
export
and
guinness
250
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
a
little
odd
big
creamy
head
makes
you
think
the
beer
is
thick
and
rich
but
once
you
get
past
the
head
its
basically
like
water
really
interested
and
i
kind
of
dont
mind
it
but
i
know
that
id
get
tired
of
it
quick
m
d
watery
weak
but
drinkable
compared
to
others
at
this
abv
theres
a
bit
of
flavor
at
least
not
a
good
stout
though
way
more
flavorful
stouts
out
there
overall
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
guinness
and
i
found
this
to
be
a
wholly
disappointing
experience
i
felt
the
flavors
and
everything
to
be
very
weak
and
thin
o
better
to
look
at
than
to
drink
but
still
an
undeniable
institution
as
many
others
have
said
foreign
extra
is
a
lot
better
but
also
a
lot
more
expensive
thats
like
reviewing
a
ford
escort
and
saying
a
mustang
is
better
though
duh
overall
the
draughtcan
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
quite
as
creamy
as
the
tapversion
and
cant
quite
hold
up
to
it
that
being
said
i
feel
like
guinness
pretty
much
defines
the
stout
style
all
other
beers
having
to
distinguish
themselves
in
some
way
its
a
classic
i
just
prefer
it
from
the
tap
overall
this
was
my
first
experience
actually
thoroughly
tasting
this
beer
and
really
enjoyed
it
it
has
a
good
aroma
and
excellent
visual
appeal
because
the
head
is
so
lacey
and
holds
so
long
the
taste
didnt
disappoint
and
actually
had
more
flavors
than
i
thought
it
went
down
smooth
and
finished
strong
a
very
enjoyable
beer
do
im
just
not
overly
impressed
with
this
i
know
a
true
contender
for
its
style
however
i
think
the
other
stuff
guinness
has
to
offer
foreign
extra
stout
extra
stout
etc
has
a
lot
more
going
for
it
then
this
i
have
had
this
on
tap
and
i
will
say
that
it
makes
it
much
better
but
out
of
a
nitro
can
i
think
this
is
much
lacking
now
i
wont
say
i
didnt
enjoy
it
over
all
taste
is
not
this
beer
strong
point
but
the
crazy
drinkablility
is
it
has
just
enough
flavor
to
be
satisfying
and
the
slight
creaminess
works
well
all
in
all
not
a
bad
hot
weather
day
beer
d
very
light
and
easydrinking
but
rather
bland
as
a
result
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
to
me
a
pint
of
guinness
is
a
lot
like
sex
or
pizza
even
when
its
bad
its
still
kinda
good
from
what
ive
heard
unless
your
in
ireland
youre
not
havin
a
real
guinness
whatever
im
not
in
ireland
and
i
like
guinness
just
fine
its
more
about
where
you
get
your
pint
ive
had
good
pints
ok
pints
and
great
pints
this
review
is
for
the
pint
of
guinness
i
got
at
the
9lb
hammer
in
georgetown
seattle
first
off
the
pour
was
done
right
i
had
to
wait
a
minute
half
way
through
for
it
to
settle
this
pint
is
deep
blackred
hue
in
the
light
with
a
cream
white
head
two
fingers
thick
beautiful
9lb
pours
the
coldest
guinness
ive
had
which
i
think
makes
the
beers
taste
fresh
and
clean
its
creamy
smooth
smoky
and
balanced
sometimes
theres
nothing
like
a
guinness
i
will
say
this
i
try
to
stay
away
from
the
cans
and
bottles
on
tap
is
the
only
way
to
have
to
have
guinness
o
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
decent
for
sure
quite
drinkable
and
not
a
bad
taste
just
not
particularly
memorable
pours
a
beautiful
creamy
one
finger
head
i
know
this
is
just
the
work
of
the
nitrogen
but
it
still
looks
amazing
the
head
is
the
closest
to
white
that
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
and
the
body
is
pitch
black
nice
contrast
the
head
hangs
in
there
forever
as
well
as
for
smell
i
mean
it
smells
like
a
guinness
its
hard
to
describe
because
its
a
one
of
a
kind
smell
and
flavor
ill
do
my
best
though
the
first
smell
you
get
is
a
sour
smell
but
its
not
nearly
as
sour
as
the
guinness
extra
stout
its
very
subtle
and
by
no
way
off
putting
the
sour
smell
is
mixed
in
with
a
sweet
malty
smell
maybe
a
tiny
tiny
bit
of
hops
in
there
somewhere
but
not
much
like
i
said
its
a
one
of
a
kind
taste
and
smell
you
have
to
have
one
to
know
what
im
talking
about
really
my
description
really
doesnt
describe
it
very
well
the
smell
isnt
amazing
because
guinness
is
not
the
most
amazing
beer
but
it
does
smell
good
and
very
smooth
the
first
thing
i
notice
on
the
flavor
is
just
a
robust
feel
to
the
beer
that
comes
in
before
an
flavor
really
i
know
robust
is
a
term
to
relate
to
flavor
but
im
using
it
with
mouthfeel
because
i
cant
think
of
anything
else
to
use
i
cant
say
its
a
thick
mouthfeel
because
it
is
a
very
thin
beer
on
the
mouth
and
i
also
cant
say
that
it
has
a
robust
flavor
because
the
flavor
is
very
simple
but
the
beer
does
have
robust
characteristics
its
hard
to
explain
but
it
just
fills
you
up
with
flavor
and
mouthfeel
even
though
it
doesnt
have
much
of
either
p
confusing
i
know
the
next
thing
i
notice
is
just
how
it
glides
across
the
mouth
i
mean
this
thing
is
so
freaking
smooth
wow
yes
it
is
a
little
watery
and
thin
on
the
mouth
but
it
is
so
smooth
on
the
actual
taste
yes
you
do
get
that
sour
flavor
but
it
is
so
small
its
hardly
noticeable
and
you
do
get
a
sweetness
and
a
malt
flavor
but
they
are
all
mixed
together
nicely
no
flavor
is
dominant
and
no
flavor
is
too
present
which
is
a
little
disappointing
that
the
flavors
arent
more
powerful
but
i
knew
they
wouldnt
be
coming
into
this
i
dont
really
get
any
hops
in
this
beer
if
there
are
any
ibus
to
this
beer
its
a
2
or
3
overall
the
flavor
is
very
good
its
not
impressive
but
its
good
smooth
and
drinkable
to
come
back
to
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
good
but
thin
drinkability
is
very
very
very
good
overall
its
a
guinness
what
else
can
i
say
good
beer
not
outstanding
but
good
make
no
mistake
as
so
many
do
this
is
not
a
stout
to
be
compared
with
a
foreign
or
extra
stout
let
alone
an
imperial
this
is
a
style
of
beer
all
its
own
and
well
worth
consideration
o
a
solid
beer
when
i
am
somewhere
with
an
almost
all
bmc
selection
enjoyable
but
not
something
i
will
get
if
there
is
anything
interesting
on
tap
i
will
usually
have
one
on
st
patricks
day
unless
foreign
extra
stout
or
gl
conways
irish
ale
are
available
there
are
a
lot
of
things
i
like
about
this
beer
especially
the
appearance
and
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
but
overall
this
beer
just
does
not
have
enough
depth
thank
you
mr
guinness
guinness
was
my
first
beer
it
has
a
very
special
place
in
my
heart
it
has
always
been
my
go
to
drink
at
a
bar
if
nothing
else
is
worthy
of
my
time
or
money
i
love
the
surge
the
beer
has
i
love
how
it
looks
like
chocolate
milk
while
pouring
and
fades
into
a
very
dark
brownish
black
color
its
the
smoothest
texture
with
a
very
nice
roasted
flavor
ill
admit
its
a
little
bit
on
the
watery
side
and
its
not
thick
at
all
but
it
still
has
a
good
quality
to
it
for
anytime
of
year
or
place
guinness
draught
from
the
11
2
fl
oz
nitro
bottle
which
was
extra
cold
as
instructed
on
the
label
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
yielded
a
enormous
dense
tan
head
that
persisted
for
several
minutes
lacing
was
spectacular
also
smell
was
like
burnt
candy
with
some
coffee
notes
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
watery
and
lacking
in
anything
worthy
of
note
overall
thiis
is
not
a
drinkable
brew
previously
i
had
this
from
a
nitro
tap
and
felt
the
same
way
i
thought
that
might
have
been
a
fluke
but
now
know
that
any
version
of
this
beer
is
not
worthy
of
a
serious
beer
drinker
my
prediction
is
this
this
review
will
not
change
the
world
in
any
way
d
very
easy
to
drink
my
very
first
drink
of
a
draught
beer
and
i
have
to
say
i
wasnt
impressed
appearance
was
quite
enticing
and
it
poured
nicely
other
than
the
oversize
head
speaking
of
which
it
was
very
creamy
looking
with
very
tiny
bubbles
if
any
at
all
the
beer
itself
is
very
dark
and
smells
of
roasted
chocolate
my
first
drink
was
actually
quite
tasty
but
every
one
after
all
i
could
get
was
the
bitterness
which
isnt
pleasant
at
all
all
in
all
there
are
better
stouts
and
draughts
out
there
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
some
postst
patricks
day
drinking
even
though
i
know
it
says
drink
from
the
bottle
i
poured
it
into
guinness
glass
anyway
dark
black
color
with
garnet
highlights
huge
creamy
white
head
surging
carbonation
its
a
good
looking
beer
no
doubt
smell
was
very
mild
mostly
cocoa
taste
was
fairly
bland
some
roasted
malt
coffee
notes
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
but
just
very
watered
down
tasting
also
the
body
was
very
thin
for
a
stout
an
easy
beer
to
drink
due
to
its
mildness
and
low
abv
but
kind
of
boring
i
would
much
rather
prefer
to
have
this
on
tap
somewhere
than
out
of
a
bottle
again
flavor
and
body
seems
to
be
better
on
tap
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
i
was
hoping
that
it
could
have
competed
with
the
likes
of
brooklyne
bcs
yeti
etc
but
this
one
let
me
down
the
rocket
widget
idea
is
pretty
nifty
at
best
i
guess
its
a
good
beginning
stout
overall
although
not
my
favourite
beer
it
definitely
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
these
throughout
the
course
of
an
evening
im
sure
ill
buy
it
again
at
some
point
overall
i
really
dont
like
guinness
extra
stout
is
one
of
my
most
despised
beers
budweiser
may
suck
but
at
least
it
is
neutral
aside
from
the
dirty
feeling
you
get
from
supporting
such
an
unethical
company
it
doesnt
offend
your
palate
quite
so
much
since
its
pretty
much
water
not
so
with
the
macroale
that
is
guinness
which
is
foul
however
at
least
they
watered
it
down
for
me
a
little
bit
with
guinness
draught
cheers
food
match
irish
stew
potatoes
and
indeed
guinness
pie
goes
down
a
treat
too
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
1
inch
dense
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
thick
and
sticky
ring
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
not
impressive
with
watery
dark
malt
and
stale
coffee
tastes
of
roasted
malt
and
watery
coffee
very
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
i
wouldnt
drink
this
very
often
i
guess
i
sort
of
was
obligated
to
try
it
on
tap
for
st
patricks
day
served
in
a
shaker
pint
glass
the
beer
arrived
near
black
with
an
appropriately
dense
cream
head
the
head
sticks
around
all
the
way
down
the
glass
and
leaves
good
lace
coffee
and
espresso
notes
fill
the
nose
plus
a
little
bit
of
grassmoss
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
make
up
the
flavor
a
hint
of
charcoal
is
there
too
dry
finish
the
body
is
quite
light
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
the
perfect
social
stout
i
honestly
prefer
murphys
over
guinness
but
im
pretty
happy
overall
o
an
easily
drinkable
stout
at
4
2
but
it
isnt
packed
with
flavor
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
rubyhighlighted
black
with
a
creamy
chunky
milkchocolate
colored
head
the
beer
leaves
a
great
lacing
on
the
glass
as
the
head
cascades
dowwn
to
its
final
one
inch
standing
creamy
sweet
nose
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
very
subtle
aromas
the
beer
has
a
subtle
dark
malt
sweetness
to
it
with
flavors
of
dark
molasses
and
caramel
with
hints
of
chocolate
this
is
quickly
followed
by
bitterness
from
coffee
flavors
as
well
as
a
slight
hop
influence
creamy
in
mouth
with
a
smooth
body
very
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
on
the
aftertaste
with
a
rather
quick
finish
very
drinkable
and
very
easy
to
drink
en
masse
d
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
because
it
is
a
little
boring
it
pours
beautifully
but
thats
the
highlight
note
i
also
had
this
on
nitrotap
at
the
wellington
in
dublin
ireland
on
62114
and
the
beer
didnt
seem
nearly
as
as
dry
and
also
seemed
to
be
a
little
sweeter
compared
to
the
version
exported
to
the
united
states
d

despite
its
shortcomings
guinness
is
a
faithful
choice
at
many
an
otherwise
limited
selection
bar
and
retailer
it
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
there
is
a
reason
it
has
been
around
as
long
as
it
has
it
is
a
musttry
for
all
beer
drinkers
young
and
old
im
sure
ill
encounter
it
much
more
in
the
future
and
ill
welcome
it
as
i
know
i
will
be
getting
a
consistently
satisfying
product
pours
out
a
blackish
color
with
a
tan
head
does
that
weird
but
neat
cascade
thing
suppose
that
is
worth
some
points
there
smells
faintly
smokey
and
mildly
astringent
taste
is
smokey
mildly
bitter
tobacco
leaf
some
very
faint
flat
beer
flavors
likely
from
pasteurization
jeez
why
pasteurize
anyway
that
in
fact
is
probably
what
kills
this
beer
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
admit
it
is
still
quite
smooooth
and
creamy
anyway
not
a
hugely
inspiring
brew
but
could
go
well
with
a
pub
burger
or
better
in
yet
in
my
corn
beef
recipe
guinness
is
really
nothing
special
but
with
great
marketing
it
connects
the
world
to
ireland
it
is
definitely
not
one
of
those
beers
that
when
i
enter
an
establishment
i
wonder
if
it
is
going
to
be
available
overall
this
isnt
the
best
of
stouts
but
it
looks
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
easy
to
drink
when
the
foam
lowers
and
its
much
better
on
tap
ive
nothing
to
add
to
the
other
f
reviews
other
than
to
say
this
swill
is
total
crap
or
bottles
if
i
havent
a
better
option

that

to

it

i
gave
the

thats
about
it
the
taste
is
really
mild

and
of
the

to
some
of
the
bigger
stouts
ive
experienced
over
the
years

d
very
easy
drinking
and

due
to
the

lacking

the

nothing
in

flavor
very
powerful
almost
on
the
bland
side
would
like
to
try
the
nontaxed
version
of
this
at
the
source
and
see
if
the
flavors
are
any
bolder
although
the
flavors
are
slightly
bland

my
preferrence

still
this

still

though
the
sad
thing
is

but
not
great
drinkability
i
can
see
why
a
lot
of
people
really
like
this
beer
its
very
easy
drinking
it
was
almost
gone
before
i
even
knew
what
was
going
on
the
look
of
this
beer
was
outstanding
but
that
was
the
best
aspect
i
bet
one
could
pound
several
of
these
no
problem
for
me
however
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
do
not
make
this
real
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
few
but
i
prefer
the
extra
stout
edit
updated
to
reflect
ratings
change
das
a
huge
fan
of
the
extra
stout
im
disappointed
by
the
draught
i
feel
as
if
im
drinking
guinness
light
that
being
said
it
is
still
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
that
one
can
put
back
all
night
assuming
you
would
be
into
drinking
watered
down
guinness
that
said
id
love
to
see
this
nitro
widget
technology
employed
on
a
beer
that
actually
tastes
like
something
imagine
north
coasts
old
rasputin
from
a
nitrobottle
bottle
i
havent
tried
this
drink
since
my
coors
extra
gold
days
now
i
understand
why
body
is
creamy
but
light
and
watery
aroma
and
palate
is
nothing
but
burnt
bittersour
grain
finish
is
dry
and
more
or
less
dissent
with
so
many
great
stouts
available
this
one
will
be
the
last
on
my
list
guiness
draught
is
probably
lauded
more
by
nonbeer
heads
than
it
should
be
and
is
also
probably
criticized
more
by
beer
heads
than
it
should
be
no
compared
to
a
great
ris
this
doesnt
even
seem
like
a
stout
but
it
has
some
enjoyable
attributes
that
big
creamy
head
easy
drinker
i
buy
an
8
pack
about
once
a
year
and
then
remember
there
are
better
options
after
ive
had
one
all
around
not
a
bad
brew
and
drinkable
i
definitely
give
two
schlitz
about
this
beer
there
are
better
stouts
for
the
price
but
this
is
still
a
fun
brew
to
have
around
drinks
very
easy
but
i
wouldnt
ever
buy
this
unless
there
absolutly
was
nothing
better
much
better
with
nitrogen
however
deasy
to
drink
although
quite
thick
sessionable
however
half
litre
can
dark
obviously
but
hints
of
red
at
the
edges
the
way
this
beer
looks
is
the
best
thing
about
it
the
head
stays
longer
than
other
beers
smells
of
smoke
hint
of
roasted
vegetables
thin
body
tastes
of
smoked
iron
very
smooth
goes
down
well

means
its
one
to
session
my
main
complaint
is
its
over
priced
to
sum
up
id
say
its
a
beer
for
accountants
well
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
the
the
other
day
with
some
friends
and
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
my
opinion
the
taste
was
fairly
bitter
but
easy
to
drink
didnt
poor
in
glass
but
foam
did
start
to
come
out
of
bottle
so
ill
just
assume
it
had
a
decent
head
and
laceing
smelled
somewhat
like
coffeeish
very
good
beer
would
definitely
recomend
drink
ability
isnt
bad
i
could
have
two
or
three
and
be
satisfied
d
its
easy
to
drink
but
its
watery
and
bland
the
beer
is
black
with
a
slight
amber
hue
to
it
the
foam
on
this
beer
is
really
interesting
very
thick
and
creamy
with
hints
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
bitter
the
foam
hits
your
palate
first
with
a
creamy
texture
the
beer
finishes
with
a
bitter
taste
that
seems
to
linger
for
a
little
bit
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
medium
heavy
the
beer
is
drinkable
md
light
airy
and
creamy
almost
like
frothed
milk
or
something
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
little
overpriced
a
classic
although
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
the
consistency
and
flavor
to
a
lesser
extent
resemble
that
of
a
home
made
chocolate
milk
super
creamy
with
little
carbonation
the
lack
of
hops
make
this
beer
a
very
straight
forward
simple
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
over
the
coarse
of
an
evening
not
recommended
buy
any
other
kind
of
guinness
over
this
may
be
worth
trying
on
tap
supposedly
the
guinness
of
lore
is
actually
the
foreign
version
so
maybe
i
will
pick
up
a
bottle
of
that
to
try
but
as
far
as
this
beer
is
concerned
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
at
all
easy
to
drink
best
when
poured
into
a
glass
d
thin
flavors
make
it
possible
to
guzzle
if
you
want
to
what
happened
to
guinness
i
used
to
drink
it
on
tap
in
ireland
where
it
was
good
then
had
to
settle
for
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
which
is
the
malt
liquor
of
stout
in
a
bottle
in
southeast
asia
then
suffered
through
guinness
extra
cold
on
tap
in
australia
only
to
come
home
to
the
us
after
twenty
years
and
experience
guinness
draught
in
a
can
no
flavour
at
all
tastes
like
water
pointless
and
i
will
never
buy
it
again
had
this
beer
on
tap
was
a
dark
brown
with
a
beautiful
regal
head
which
hung
around
throughout
the
experience
smelled
some
caramel
malts
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
was
initially
good
to
me
which
i
was
able
to
taste
the
malts
caramel
slight
coffeel
and
finished
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
the
brew
went
down
ok
yeah
i
could
drink
this
again
but
it
was
just
a
ok
experience
and
if
theres
a
better
choice
i
would
choose
the
other
choice
first
but
its
a
good
solid
brew
d
very
heavy
beer
but
very
enjoyable
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
a
dark
stout
d
low
abv
would
make
it
a
very
drinkable
stout
however
it
is
heavy
and
creamy
which
makes
it
almost
a
meal
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
nothing
special
a
very
light
dry
watery
sout
overall
a
nice
drinker
for
those
that
dont
want
a
buzz
its
more
pretty
than
good
easy
to
drink
like
drinking
water
it
is
good
compared
to
crap
which
doesnt
say
much
this
brew
will
always
be
my
favorite
most
individuals
are
intimidated
to
try
it
because
of
how
dark
and
rich
it
pours
the
pour
from
a
can
or
on
tap
is
iconic
and
there
is
a
particular
way
to
pour
this
brew
the
taste
is
a
delicate
mixture
of
malt
and
coffee
despite
its
rich
pour
and
thick
head
the
beer
is
like
and
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
this
beer
only
gets
better
and
as
it
warms
in
a
mug
it
poured
a
dark
as
ten
nights
brew
with
a
thick
creamy
brown
crown
thin
body
roasted
malts
some
hints
of
coffe
on
the
nose
fairly
the
same
on
the
palate
watery
and
smooth
at
first
sip
and
then
it
develops
into
a
nice
roasted
malts
taste
without
out
loosing
the
smoothness
towards
the
end
very
good
drinkability
and
aftertaste
drinkability
is
tough
you
can
find
this
anywhere
anywhere
in
the
world
theyll
have
this
any
pisspoor
macro
american
bar
you
visit
will
still
offer
guinness
it
goes
down
quickly
and
smoothly
low
in
alcohol
but
i
only
drink
this
these
days
as
a
last
resort
or
if
i
get
a
craving
for
a
black
and
tan
so
despite
the
good
factors
if
i
dont
want
to
drink
it
is
it
really
that
drinkable
d
very
easy
to
drink
d
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
brew
in
regards
to
mouthfeel
and
overall
thickness
of
the
beer
d
one
of
the
best
macro
brewed
beers
in
my
opinion
the
flavour
is
very
complex
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
the
verdict
is
that
it
isnt
the
best
stout
out
there
but
sometimes
this
just
hits
the
spot
plus
it
just
looks
awesome
drinkability
is
fantastic
this
goes
down
so
easy
i
love
it
guinness
has
something
about
it
that
i
cant
explain
but
its
just
wonderful
and
sooo
smooth
i
love
guinness
for
all
of
the
hype
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
i
would
be
willing
to
try
it
on
draft
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
this
time
around
poured
from
a
nitro
can
into
a
stout
glass
pours
a
beautiful
black
with
a
slowly
forming
rich
and
creamy
head
smells
of
caramel
and
burnt
coffee
upon
tasting
this
stout
the
caramel
and
burnt
coffee
flavors
are
initially
tasted
followed
by
a
creamy
a
slightly
hopped
flavor
this
is
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
stout
and
is
a
great
stout
for
newcomers
to
a
deeper
and
full
flavored
beer
i
have
truly
grown
accostomed
to
the
unique
flavor
this
stout
has
to
offer
and
has
been
a
bridgeway
to
trying
and
loving
numerous
other
brews
as
my
taste
buds
developed
although
ive
tasted
many
high
quality
stouts
over
time
i
still
really
enjoy
a
guinness
drought
from
time
to
time
and
feel
it
necessary
to
pay
homage
to
this
fine
stout
pours
really
nice
one
and
a
half
fingers
of
thick
nitro
head
atop
a
jet
black
beer
notes
of
burnt
grain
are
on
the
nose
but
i
think
that
the
coldness
is
killing
it
after
letting
it
warm
up
the
beer
improved
with
a
bit
of
a
better
thicker
body
and
notes
of
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
nevertheless
it
is
still
quite
thin
but
the
mouthfeel
is
eveneed
out
by
the
creaminess
of
the
nitro
head
i
ordered
this
bc
their
only
other
even
moderately
interesting
beers
was
sam
adams
lager
and
rickards
white
i
wanted
something
a
little
thicker
and
it
did
the
trick
in
the
grand
scheme
of
great
beer
this
beer
is
a
joke
for
what
it
is
stylewise
or
what
have
you
its
okay
but
there
are
better
murphys
for
one
if
im
simply
trying
to
deliver
alcohol
to
the
system
id
be
bonkers
to
start
pounding
this
guinness
draught
to
sum
up
probably
goes
best
as
something
to
wash
down
food
nothing
more
overall
a
decent
beer
conclusion
nitrocan
is
much
better
than
most
commercial
beers
however
it
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
the
guinness
i
had
in
ireland
it
is
more
bitter
without
the
taste
and
smell
of
the
original
still
a
good
mainstream
stout
though
it
has
a
beautiful
blackness
with
the
cascading
creamy
foam
and
looks
absolutely
fantastic
however
ive
never
dissected
it
before
so
thats
the
first
problem
i
literally
smell
nothing
i
keep
trying
but
honestly
i
cant
smell
anything
it
smells
like
water
the
tastes
there
is
slight
and
i
cant
emphasize
the
slight
enough
burnt
malt
taste
with
a
cream
kicker
and
the
legendary
sour
thats
the
only
thing
separating
it
from
just
being
a
thick
tasteless
liquid
to
me
its
nice
and
creamy
but
there
is
a
watered
down
feel
even
to
that
i
could
pound
these
all
day
and
they
arent
too
high
of
an
abv
so
thats
something
to
go
off
of
its
not
like
ill
never
have
it
again
but
its
never
my
first
choice
anymore
if
youve
never
had
guinness
you
need
to
have
it
at
least
once
in
your
life
maybe
around
st
patricks
day
or
something
sláinte
d
this
is
drinkable
only
4
2
abv
but
i
perfer
on
draft
rather
than
in
a
bottle
overall
i
was
not
particularly
impressed
i
keep
drying
this
when
im
out
expect
to
discover
theres
a
magical
tap
that
fixes
all
this
beers
problems
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
beer
needs
flavor
to
be
good
and
this
beer
simply
doesnt
have
any
d
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
not
as
challenging
as
extra
stout
or
similar
smooth
and
sessionable
but
just
lacking
the
intesnity
of
flavor
i
judge
all
other
stouts
by
guinness
which
sets
the
bar
rather
low
i
suppose
but
at
least
this
way
it
truly
distinguishes
whats
a
good
stout
and
what
isnt
youve
got
to
try
really
hard
to
make
a
stout
worse
than
guinness
d
definitively
drinkable
again
a
classic
pub
drink
you
cant
go
wrong
with
guiness
impressive
looking
pour
looks
milky
thick
with
tons
of
bubbles
rising
pitch
black
color
big
fat
beige
head
nice
lacing
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
and
its
all
down
hill
from
here
funky
bitter
black
licorice
smell
the
first
thing
i
noticed
after
the
first
taste
was
how
watery
it
was
in
fact
there
is
not
much
else
going
on
here
they
should
have
labeled
it
black
licorice
water
a
big
disappointment
ahhh
guinness
always
got
it
at
a
bar
but
never
from
the
nitro
can
pours
with
that
amazing
cascading
look
looks
amazing
every
time
and
only
see
it
with
this
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
nice
huge
fluffy
head
medium
to
full
body
pretty
good
mouthfeel
taste
is
very
bland
some
malts
shining
through
but
very
water
to
me
i
actually
really
enjoy
the
draft
but
the
draught
seems
to
be
more
gimmicy
with
the
bottle
and
nitro
insert
what
matters
is
the
product
cool
to
try
but
really
is
way
overhyped
meh
d
like
i
mentioned
it
has
its
time
and
place
even
though
those
times
and
places
are
fleeting
at
best
good
beginner
beer
for
someone
that
wants
to
work
their
way
up
the
dark
beer
ladder
but
bad
if
they
like
this
and
expect
better
beers
to
taste
similar
the
beer
was
beautiful
jet
black
with
an
ample
eggshell
that
softly
cascades
down
the
glass
i
can
never
get
over
how
cool
this
looks
the
beer
is
soft
and
creamy
but
without
much
aroma
or
taste
it
is
a
little
bitter
and
roasty
but
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
other
dry
stouts
the
beer
is
clean
dry
and
luxurious
from
nitrogen
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
pleasurable
i
could
down
this
beer
all
night
the
only
problem
is
that
it
is
ubiquitous
but
has
craft
beer
price
final
notes
i
think
arthur
guinness
would
be
rolling
around
in
his
grave
to
think
how
modern
guinness
has
been
bastardized
like
it
has
nothing
compares
to
real
irish
guinness
im
afraid
ive
only
had
a
bottle
of
foreign
stout
once
ill
never
forget
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
light
hard
to
pick
up
too
much
of
anything
distinct
maybe
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
taste
follows
the
nose
unfortunately
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
mouthfeel
has
a
creamy
yet
watery
characteristic
to
it
as
noted
by
others
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
a
lot
more
years
ago
not
sure
whether
guinness
changed
or
my
palate
did
or
both
cant
believe
i
drank
this
for
all
those
yearsnot
my
favorite
not
the
first
time
ive
had
this
one
obviously
appearance
is
great
as
always
huge
foamy
head
with
tons
of
lacing
smells
of
light
malty
coffee
and
some
sweetness
i
always
think
the
taste
is
stronger
than
it
ends
up
being
very
delicious
but
a
little
light
for
my
taste
but
that
is
the
point
of
the
style
so
ill
say
average
overall
great
beer
for
the
style
at
a
great
price
i
dont
know
if
you
can
find
a
smoother
drink
overall
guinness
draught
is
rarely
my
first
choice
at
either
the
bar
or
the
bottle
shop
but
it
is
a
classic
that
i
wont
refuse
if
offered
rjt
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
it
at
least
twice
a
month
my
favorite
place
to
get
a
pint
of
guinness
is
at
onearys
irish
pub
in
brainerd
minnesota
down
town
i
dont
know
what
its
made
of
but
i
taste
coffee
molases
not
real
hoppy
maybe
some
malt
i
give
it
a
perfect
score
the
last
part
of
the
stout
is
the
best
part
this
looked
like
the
gulf
of
mexico
courtesy
of
bp
in
a
glass
it
had
a
fingers
worth
thick
rich
cap
of
mediumtan
head
with
great
retention
capable
of
hanging
around
well
into
the
fall
color
was
a
solid
tarblack
with
zero
lightpenetration
thank
goodness
i
dont
need
to
recap
it
because
i
wouldnt
know
where
to
start
nose
had
a
light
milk
chocolate
sweetness
underlain
by
a
mild
roastiness
kind
of
smoky
kind
of
charcoal
mouthfeel
was
silky
creamy
like
a
dollop
of
something
you
might
add
to
your
coffee
speaking
of
coffee
that
was
its
initial
flavour
on
the
tongue
it
was
then
followed
by
a
chocolaty
sweetness
and
then
a
charcoal
bitterness
finish
was
dry
more
toward
the
charcoalsmoke
taste
than
the
sweetness
noted
earlier
great
lacing
throughout
hopefully
no
pelicans
are
nearby
not
really
a
coolerworthy
beer
but
more
of
a
soccer
or
rugby
match
on
the
telly
beer
did
i
mention
i
now
have
the
dish
network
doctor
who
every
weekday
at
5
pm
on
bbc
america
whos
your
doctor
and
whats
in
your
wallet
due
to
its
creamy
mouthfeel
and
relatively
lowish
alcohol
you
can
drink
these
all
night
long
despite
the
limited
taste
it
does
go
down
easy
im
just
not
a
fan
pours
a
pitch
black
with
thick
white
head
propped
up
by
the
nitro
im
sure
head
retention
and
lacing
are
there
throughout
but
it
always
feels
artificial
with
a
nitro
smells
of
faint
roasted
malt
and
little
bit
of
coffee
taste
has
some
of
the
roastiness
from
a
stout
but
it
is
on
the
watery
side
very
creamy
mouthfeel
but
it
feels
too
light
for
the
flavour
i
have
not
had
it
in
a
while
but
like
some
other
ba
members
i
remember
this
being
much
better
d
well
this
is
a
big
disappointment
i
havent
had
a
pint
in
a
bar
in
a
really
long
time
but
i
dont
remember
guinness
ever
being
so
blah
glad
that
someone
left
these
at
the
house
and
i
didnt
buy
them
dont
bother
with
this
there
are
better
dry
stouts
to
be
had
the
head
is
thick
and
creamy
but
the
body
is
so
thin
it
is
shocking
this
is
a
real
sessionable
dry
stout
not
really
filling
like
i
remember
the
taste
shows
those
sweet
roasty
malts
and
a
dry
finish
that
is
quite
nice
pours
a
almost
solid
black
with
a
rich
cream
head
that
will
not
go
away
for
anything
very
sexy
very
good
lacing
and
almost
no
carbonation
goes
down
very
smooth
at
first
sip
it
taste
like
coffee
a
very
cold
coffee
with
a
hint
of
hops
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
i
just
wish
i
could
actually
try
some
from
dublin
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
appearance
is
good
and
the
smell
is
fresh
the
taste
is
quite
different
from
most
beers
ive
had
at
first
it
tastes
of
hops
and
cold
coffee
drinkability
is
only
average
it
is
hard
to
drink
this
beer
if
you
arent
use
to
stout
drinking
more
than
3
will
get
you
a
good
buzz
going
on
and
it
gets
harder
and
harder
to
drink
this
beer
creamy
and
smooth
the
brew
is
a
bit
thin
and
light
but
sustained
by
a
bitter
interesting
propagates
well
in
the
throat
leaving
the
beer
a
little
rest
traces
of
roasting
are
felt
with
small
spikes
of
acidity
but
particularly
touches
of
coffee
a
bit
like
the
nose
d
not
meant
for
immediate
refreshment
it
is
best
served
with
a
meal
it
is
great
with
traditional
angloamerican
dishes
and
fish
12
ounce
nitro
widget
bottle
pours
a
dark
charcoal
black
with
a
ful
12
head
with
incredible
retention
due
to
the
injection
of
nitrogen
the
head
just
will
not
go
down
and
cascades
down
the
side
of
the
glass
as
you
go
on
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
bittersweet
chocolate
with
that
unique
guinness
smell
that
i
assume
is
a
byproduct
of
the
nitrogen
one
thing
that
has
always
amazed
me
with
guinness
is
just
how
quaffable
it
is
everyone
assumes
that
dark
beers
are
challenging
to
finish
thats
not
the
case
with
this
beer
its
easy
to
drink
which
is
probably
why
i
got
into
it
in
the
first
place
the
taste
gives
you
lots
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
in
the
background
and
the
nitrogen
lends
the
beer
a
nice
creaminess
chocolate
milk
isnt
necessarily
the
best
description
guinness
isnt
a
milk
stout
but
perhaps
something
like
yoohoo
is
more
appropriate
there
are
some
hops
there
though
they
are
quite
earthy
and
muted
fuggles
perhaps
the
hops
lend
a
nice
and
lightly
bitter
finish
to
the
entire
affair
overall
guinness
remains
an
irish
classic
and
one
of
the
best
stouts
on
the
market
today
d
ive
always
loved
guinness
and
the
bottles
though
not
quite
as
good
as
draught
are
still
quite
tasty
guinness
has
done
a
great
job
of
preserving
the
quality
of
their
product
for
mass
distribution
i
always
have
and
will
continue
to
love
their
stout
drinkability
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
have
one
or
two
with
dinner
hell
i
could
probably
drink
guinness
draught
for
breakfast
when
in
a
bar
that
serves
bud
coors
miller
carona
and
that
sort
a
guinness
draught
will
put
a
smile
on
my
face
every
time
well
i
should
start
by
admitting
that
its
not
really
fair
to
the
guinness
folks
to
do
a
review
on
their
bottled
product
my
very
first
guinness
was
straight
out
of
the
tap
at
a
small
pub
just
off
grafton
street
near
trinity
college
in
dublin
ireland
i
thought
i
had
died
and
gone
to
heaven
and
have
had
a
lot
of
guinness
since
in
a
lot
of
places
a
lot
of
styles
this
nitro
bottle
is
actually
not
bad
for
a
bottled
beer
but
its
not
the
same
as
a
real
nitrotapped
guinness
fresh
from
a
hopping
pub
this
beer
pours
more
dark
brown
than
the
classic
guinness
black
the
head
is
okay
but
has
a
lot
of
larger
bubbles
it
does
cling
well
to
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
and
the
head
does
carry
a
lot
of
the
good
bitter
hops
onto
your
tongue
otherwise
the
beer
is
just
not
so
great
it
has
a
coffee
flavor
that
is
too
mellow
and
a
texture
that
is
a
bit
too
watery
nothing
near
as
thick
and
creamy
as
a
real
guinness
overall
i
think
ill
save
my
guinness
moments
for
those
good
pubs
that
know
how
to
keep
it
fresh
and
pour
it
correctly
into
a
proper
imperial
pint
glass
would
be
ok
as
an
alternative
to
a
cheap
lager
or
other
macrobrew
but
i
think
its
a
lowerend
porter
the
guinness
in
europe
may
be
different
so
its
hard
to
judge
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
american
version
and
i
agree
its
overpriced
i
cant
judge
this
objectively
because
i
think
i
recieved
an
old
six
pack
from
local
store
very
flat
no
taste
was
very
generous
with
the
ratings
for
this
particular
pack
had
it
many
times
before
and
has
always
been
very
average
at
best
im
not
much
of
a
stout
fan
inthe
summer
for
obvious
reasons
but
a
friend
brought
some
by
and
it
was
such
a
bad
pack
i
had
to
write
something
sooo
average
at
best
thank
you
overall
not
bad
i
was
hoping
for
better
with
all
the
advertising
and
such
guinness
does
this
is
somewhat
comparable
to
saranacs
irish
stout
but
i
liked
this
one
better
nicely
drinkable
but
it
has
become
a
little
pedestrian
for
my
taste
there
is
still
no
comparison
between
the
rich
creaminess
of
guinness
on
tap
and
any
other
form
but
if
you
wanted
to
enjoy
a
guinness
away
from
the
pub
this
is
the
next
best
thing

score
head
is
smooth
and
white
while
the
body
very
dark
though
not
pitch
black
the
creaminess
from
nitro
takes
a
while
to
settle
but
ultimately
produces
a
fairly
stable
foam
and
fine
mouthfeel
theres
hardly
any
smell
maybe
a
faint
smokiness
clean
taste
very
light
with
only
a
trace
of
sweetness
light
coffee
and
toast
throughout
the
virtue
of
this
beer
lies
in
the
lack
of
offensive
qualities
rather
than
any
outstanding
taste
the
smoothness
and
lightness
make
it
quaffable
geinness
draught
poured
black
with
a
good
size
head
it
has
a
coffee
like
smell
but
its
very
weak
it
taste
rather
watery
with
a
little
bit
of
chochlate
and
coffee
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
the
lightist
stout
i
ever
had
overall
this
stout
is
great
on
a
summer
day
because
its
not
to
heavy
but
missing
alot
for
someone
looking
for
a
real
stout
this
is
much
like
drinking
second
or
third
runnings
off
of
the
mash
of
a
brew
bitter
almost
atringent
and
very
thin
if
im
going
to
session
i
would
prefer
a
pale
ale
because
this
embarrasses
stouts
with
flavor
exceptional
beer
when
on
a
nitrous
tap
it
puts
other
guinness
to
shame
d
high
refreshing
beer
after
all
the
combination
of
the
dry
taste
reasonable
bitterness
and
a
low
abv
makes
it
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
good
black
stuff
drinkability
is
great
though
low
abv
and
light
flavor
makes
it
easy
to
pound
not
worth
the
cost
though
imo
guinness
is
the
most
overpriced
beer
on
the
market
should
be
67
for
a
sixer
not
910
decent
enough
beer
but
nothing
like
i
recall
it
from
20
years
ago
as
a
pup
in
the
beer
world
ok
i
finally
broke
down
and
bought
a
12pack
of
the
these
bottles
because
they
were
on
sale
what
a
mistake
it
tastes
like
watereddown
guinness
you
dont
get
to
see
the
beer
as
my
avatar
will
attest
one
of
the
great
things
about
drinking
guinness
only
11
oz
in
the
bottle
was
gone
after
1
2
sips
i
hope
that
this
does
not
become
the
way
for
guinness
in
the
future
this
is
a
truly
disappointing
stout
i
watched
the
historic
pubs
of
dublin
pbs
special
today
again
and
was
inspired
to
have
a
good
stout
or
a
guinness
a
sad
sad
night
not
a
fan
of
the
draught
bottle
youre
missing
out
on
the
visual
part
of
guinness
which
is
the
best
part
its
a
pretty
cool
concept
and
executed
well
but
with
its
inability
to
be
poured
into
a
glass
its
pretty
bad
the
only
thing
i
like
about
this
is
that
it
tastes
like
guinness
and
you
can
bring
the
bottle
camping
tailgating
or
wherever
a
glass
is
inconvenient
d
very
drinkableprobably
the
worlds
best
chugging
beer
though
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
complement
the
beer
is
okay
but
is
rather
mundane
and
boring
overall
i
see
a
lot
of
mixed
reviews
for
this
beer
not
among
the
greatest
but
i
enjoy
it
d
the
low
abv
is
nice
but
that
is
the
redeeming
factor
for
drinkability
i
know
i
will
have
again
someday
on
tap
at
a
true
irish
pub
but
i
am
not
drinking
this
more
than
one
at
a
time
if
any
at
a
time
d
this
was
probably
altered
a
bit
to
get
to
can
form
and
although
its
drinkable
the
lack
of
flavor
just
makes
me
crave
a
guinness
from
the
tap
so
maybe
it
did
its
job
in
making
me
want
to
drink
more
guinness
but
it
fails
in
that
the
guinness
i
want
to
drink
is
not
this
form
of
it
for
shame
put
more
time
into
your
brew
and
less
time
into
your
marketing
youve
clearly
generated
enough
profit
to
launch
massive
campaigns
utilize
on
the
product
drinkability
good
because
it
is
portable
guinness
i
will
always
prefer
the
pint
at
the
pub
i
think
guinness
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
i
good
example
of
a
dry
stout
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
thought
the
whole
nitrocan
thing
was
a
little
unnecessary
i
found
it
made
the
beer
flat
feeling
and
a
little
watery
tasting
i
know
it
is
supposed
to
mimic
the
whole
tap
experience
thing
but
i
find
the
experience
lacking
i
much
prefer
the
bottled
version
if
drinking
it
at
home
i
tried
two
types
of
guinness
on
the
night
that
i
took
the
notes
that
would
become
the
review
that
you
are
reading
now
nitrobottle
and
nitrocan
both
are
belowaverage
beers
at
best
the
nitrobottle
version
is
flatout
awful
avoid
it
at
all
costs
i
found
the
nitrocan
version
to
be
an
upgrade
but
still
the
beer
is
below
par
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
irish
dry
stout
style
there
is
probably
a
delicious
version
made
right
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
dear
reader
go
drink
that
local
dry
stout
instead
notes
this
beer
does
not
live
up
to
the
true
guinness
on
draft
but
everyone
knows
that
not
a
bad
beer
slightly
better
than
average
but
thats
it
drinkability
for
all
its
faults
this
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
think
overall
it
works
better
in
a
complementary
role
with
a
meal
or
something
better
than
it
stands
on
its
own
d
this
was
my
first
beer
and
while
i
have
since
moved
onto
greener
pastures
this
still
holds
a
special
place
no
its
not
the
best
beer
in
the
word
not
even
the
best
in
its
category
try
oharas
or
murphys
but
the
fact
that
its
so
widely
available
and
ubiquitous
insures
that
it
remains
a
staple
of
mine
highly
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
for
enjoying
the
company
of
friends
drinkability
this
beer
finishes
very
quickly
and
is
much
tastier
than
drinking
a
low
calorie
american
adjunct
while
beating
most
of
them
in
calories
not
great
but
i
can
drink
these
all
day
long
o
excellent
beautiful
cream
with
just
a
hair
of
bitterness
4
5
overall
what
guinness
should
be
very
smooth
almost
creamy
with
a
roastedburnt
malt
flavor
if
you
have
never
tried
a
stout
try
this
one
first
or
something
more
robust
might
level
you
nicknamed
blonde
in
a
black
dress
by
who
knows
who
guinness
is
more
than
gimmicky
paraphernalia
very
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
beers
love
the
creamy
head
and
mustache
that
i
get
from
drinking
it
the
best
way
to
enjoy
a
night
out
without
worrying
about
too
much
alcohol
at
4
2
i
hate
when
you
go
to
a
bar
and
they
dont
know
the
proper
pouring
technique
for
guinness
love
the
taste
of
my
guinness
watery
and
not
very
stoutlike
now
that
i
know
of
alternatives
i
will
not
be
returning
often
dthis
is
an
old
favorite
that
i
havent
had
ontap
in
a
very
long
time
very
easy
drinking
and
often
the
best
choice
at
shitty
bars
that
i
find
myself
in
from
time
to
time
while
its
not
complex
at
all
its
not
the
swill
that
some
make
it
out
to
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
many
drinks
really
easy
decent
session
beer
that
can
be
found
seemingly
everywhere
lacks
in
much
flavor
but
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
d
possibly
a
good
session
beer
but
i
would
personally
not
prefer
it
nevertheless
is
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
all
night
easy
enough
to
drink
but
id
put
a
two
can
limit
on
this
one
drink
about
9
or
10
on
a
thirsty
day
easy
aroma
is
disappointingly
thin
with
some
roasted
malt
flavor
is
more
bitter
roasted
malt
and
coffee
with
a
creamy
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
but
still
creamy
overall
doesnt
stack
up
to
its
appearance
but
still
pretty
drinkable
basic
stout
that
i
think
sets
the
above
average
drink
thick
sweet
with
a
slight
taste
of
bitter
to
it
i
prefer
it
at
60
to
70
deg
f
refrigerate
for
about
15
to
20
minutes
and
drink
my
least
favorite
of
the
big
3
irish
stouts
drinkability
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
id
certainly
have
it
again
i
am
worried
about
the
effects
of
the
nitro
but
it
doesnt
really
take
away
from
the
drinkability
this
beer
is
still
worth
a
try
and
im
sure
ill
have
it
again
at
some
point
d
spot
on
for
style
with
the
low
abv
lighter
body
and
clean
finish
this
makes
a
great
session
beer
d
for
me
near
perfection
i
perfect
everyday
beer
i
love
my
ipas
and
lagers
but
i
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
guinness
is
this
seriously
the
same
beverage
that
was
my
gateway
into
good
beer
drinking
back
in
1995
a
poor
example
of
the
style
although
ive
been
known
to
tip
back
a
few
for
old
times
sake
now
and
then
slainte
overall
there
are
other
more
flavorful
stouts
out
there
to
be
sure
but
guinness
is
very
drinkable
and
a
beauty
to
behold
if
poured
correctly
a
classic
had
this
beer
from
a
nitrocan
its
decent
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
but
i
do
like
it
very
smooth
from
the
can
not
a
great
deal
of
flavor
it
is
what
it
is
i
recently
had
murphys
from
a
nitrocan
and
i
think
i
may
like
that
one
even
more
if
youre
looking
for
an
irish
beer
you
have
to
start
with
guinness
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
a
guiness
so
i
guess
st
patricks
day
is
a
good
time
to
get
reaquainted
it
was
served
to
me
already
settled
with
no
cascading
effect
maybe
the
nitrogen
is
turned
down
not
exactly
sure
how
that
works
still
had
a
big
creamy
head
that
sticks
to
the
sides
like
crazy
smell
not
much
to
report
a
little
bit
of
roasted
grain
maybe
taste
much
of
the
same
what
happened
did
they
water
this
down
i
cant
believe
that
my
palate
evolved
that
much
in
only
a
year
or
two
that
a
beer
that
i
once
loved
now
tastes
so
bland
either
way
im
less
than
impressed
i
guess
a
plus
side
is
its
easy
to
drink
and
low
on
calories
ive
had
a
million
of
these
but
never
sat
down
to
review
it
did
not
mark
as
high
as
i
had
expected
but
it
is
the
beer
that
moved
me
to
try
other
things
so
for
that
im
greatfull
thank
you
st
james
gate
a
tasty
classic
that
is
best
on
tap
but
good
from
the
can
and
bottle
guinness
is
always
known
as
the
standard
for
stouts
and
while
i
find
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
always
enjoyable
the
reality
is
that
the
taste
is
only
average
overall
as
much
as
i
want
to
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
when
i
first
had
it
it
just
does
not
seem
the
same
as
i
remember
its
like
a
bland
dull
version
of
what
i
knew
yes
its
drinkable
but
not
nearly
as
much
so
as
the
extra
stout
which
even
though
this
one
was
brewed
in
canada
is
at
least
a
head
above
the
irishbrewed
draught
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
and
thin
with
a
very
dry
finish
the
nitro
head
creates
a
creamy
sensation
with
each
sip
the
carbonation
is
very
low
overall
its
a
bit
lifeless
but
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
nitro
pours
drinkability
is
the
main
feature
of
this
beer
its
meant
to
be
enjoyed
in
multiples
and
the
low
alcohol
content
and
thin
body
helps
that
cause
the
only
good
thing
about
guinness
the
cool
cascading
head
if
you
pour
it
right
that
and
its
2
cheaper
per
six
pack
on
march
17th
first
sip
is
lighter
than
i
expected
its
got
a
darker
malt
quality
and
something
of
a
sweet
aftertaste
but
aside
from
that
it
seems
to
be
a
fairly
simple
beer
d
quite
a
dissapointment
after
the
pour
and
the
smell
but
still
for
beeing
a
macrobeer
its
not
bad
at
all
d
this
is
a
heavy
hitter
in
the
drinkability
category
as
this
can
be
a
solid
choice
any
time
while
i
do
believe
this
is
the
best
looking
beer
during
pour
there
is
there
is
really
no
redeeming
value
to
this
brew
past
the
visual
aesthetics
not
like
guinness
from
a
tap
very
sweet
and
thin
tasting
flavors
of
copper
milk
chocolate
and
light
brown
sugar
foamy
thin
carbonation
and
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
of
bitter
prunes
looks
like
guinness
sort
of
smells
like
guinness
but
tastes
off
and
is
not
an
accurate
representation
of
guinness
stout
the
cans
are
somehow
14
9
ounces
but
priced
more
expensive
than
other
pints
im
just
not
sure
the
nitro
can
idea
really
works
the
thin
flat
character
of
this
brew
is
pretty
unacceptable
why
exactly
do
they
sell
this
and
sully
the
good
name
of
this
venerable
brand
ill
avoid
this
variation
on
guinness
in
the
future
drinkability
i
could
have
a
twenty
of
these
d
this
is
an
old
classic
it
may
be
overrated
and
or
over
worshipped
by
some
but
it
does
have
its
place
as
an
easy
drinking
full
bodied
beer
it
does
not
get
one
drunk
or
fill
one
up
contrary
to
belief
but
it
does
give
a
strong
lingering
sourness
that
gets
old
after
a
few
of
these
great
to
pair
with
corned
beef
and
cabbage
when
my
friend
let
me
try
this
beer
i
did
not
like
it
at
all
the
taste
was
not
great
at
all
it
smelled
bad
and
the
taste
was
funky
to
me
in
my
opinion
i
rather
drink
guinness
harp
over
this
sorry
excuse
for
a
beer
please
dont
waste
you
money
not
worth
the
time
d
yea
its
highly
drinkable
i
rated
this
beer
as
a
session
beer
nitrotap
makes
a
pretty
big
difference
the
body
is
more
creamy
and
it
seems
to
help
come
through
with
some
of
the
coffee
flavors
the
beer
is
black
yes
but
its
pretty
light
in
almost
every
other
aspect
light
to
mild
coffee
flavors
with
a
light
black
chocolate
bitter
dry
finish
i
get
one
on
saint
pattys
day
and
it
was
a
beer
that
i
used
as
a
building
block
for
my
beeramid
its
one
of
those
beers
that
i
used
to
think
was
really
good
when
i
first
started
tasting
other
things
than
bmc
brews
but
when
coming
back
to
it
to
give
it
a
proper
rating
it
wasnt
what
i
remember
it
ok
beer
great
heritage
and
has
a
huge
culture
and
following
behind
it
god
save
ireland
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
tan
head
of
about
one
finger
dont
get
much
of
a
smell
but
what
i
do
get
is
the
faint
aroma
of
coffee
and
toasted
malts
tastes
of
coffee
slightly
bitter
very
smooth
beer
with
a
decent
bit
of
carbonation
so
easy
to
drink
especially
if
youre
a
coffee
fanatic
the
appearance
is
super
dark
brown
with
a
a
nitro
head
that
looks
nice
but
is
not
big
enough
the
aroma
is
coffee
burnt
malt
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
but
not
strong
enough
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
and
the
best
part
of
the
beer
the
palate
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
but
ok
everything
about
this
beer
is
good
but
is
not
strong
enough
at
least
for
me
this
is
the
classic
guinness
and
the
draught
system
works
fairly
well
however
there
are
far
better
stouts
notes
guinness
was
my
introduction
to
stout
and
continues
to
be
the
measuring
stick
others
are
judged
by
i
find
guinness
to
be
at
its
best
if
i
pull
it
out
of
the
fridge
and
wait
20
minutes
before
opening
my
son
loves
this
beer
and
he
can
have
it
it
has
no
taste
to
me
what
so
ever
i
dont
see
what
the
fuss
is
about
this
beer
it
looks
good
only
because
it
resembles
chocolate
but
it
just
tastes
bad
i
know
alot
of
people
love
this
beer
just
not
all
of
us
color
is
classic
deep
black
with
a
beautiful
head
love
the
way
the
bubbles
go
down
probably
the
most
iconic
looking
beer
in
the
world
smell
is
pretty
good
has
a
nice
chocolately
malt
aroma
to
it
taste
is
pretty
good
too
i
love
to
drink
guinness
but
i
dont
think
the
taste
is
outstanding
i
dont
know
if
that
makes
much
sense
but
its
just
a
good
beer
and
a
treat
from
the
mundane
mouthfeel
is
probably
its
biggest
downfall
it
is
very
watery
which
is
surprising
considering
its
color
as
most
stouts
are
much
thicker
and
richer
drinkability
is
high
at
least
for
me
because
i
do
love
guinness
people
say
that
guinness
is
the
standard
for
the
irish
stout
style
and
in
this
case
the
standard
is
utterly
average
when
had
from
the
can
canoacano
murphys
blows
this
stuff
out
of
the
water
much
smoother
less
harsh
but
with
all
the
flavor
plus
the
murphys
can
is
a
full
pint
sorry
guinness
at
least
youre
very
popular
drinkability
is
good
its
definitely
a
great
drinking
beer
its
light
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
drinks
like
chocolate
milk
i
cant
say
it
has
a
great
aroma
or
taste
like
some
of
my
favorite
stouts
but
the
appearance
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
very
good
in
this
classic
beer
happy
st
patricks
stick
with
it
on
draught
the
can
is
certainly
drinkable
but
youre
drinking
a
shadow
of
the
original
form
best
not
be
disappointed
and
go
with
the
good
stuff
notes
light
and
watery
decent
roasted
flavors
but
just
too
light
we
all
know
what
its
about
dark
stout
yadda
yadda
but
if
you
go
to
a
place
that
has
good
guinness
on
tap
good
stuff
a
solid
stout
cheers
overall
having
had
the
draught
poured
correctly
in
england
and
scotland
i
can
honestly
the
difference
in
the
widgeted
bottle
isnt
palpable
to
methe
reliability
and
drinkability
make
this
a
great
partner
to
any
number
of
activities
recognizable
branding
and
availability
make
this
also
a
winner
for
conveniences
sake
very
easy
to
drink
not
much
taste
here
so
im
not
sure
id
want
more
than
one
but
nothing
offensive
in
the
drinkability
either
easydrinking
d
the
nostalgia
of
guinness
being
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
is
tough
to
beat
but
ive
had
way
too
many
beers
since
then
to
really
rate
guinness
high
that
said
its
my
go
to
in
a
bar
with
no
craft
beer
d
despite
the
watered
down
flavor
and
weird
mouthfeel
this
dam
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
its
not
something
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
i
look
forward
to
trying
better
versions
of
guinness
but
for
now
my
impression
has
been
tarnished
pours
into
a
frothy
auburn
maelstrom
that
settles
via
cascade
into
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
body
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
tan
head
that
laces
very
nicely
there
isnt
much
to
the
smell
only
small
bits
of
oats
malts
coffee
and
sugar
all
very
faint
the
taste
delivers
a
solid
amount
of
dark
grains
with
phases
of
milkiness
and
that
trademark
guinness
halfsour
at
the
back
the
body
is
near
the
top
of
the
moderate
scale
and
is
extremely
smooth
leading
to
a
highly
drinkable
brew
one
of
my
favorite
widelydistributed
brews
i
have
to
admit
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
but
untill
i
got
into
really
teasing
beer
i
never
enjoyed
it
how
ever
i
have
gained
a
new
respect
for
this
beerthe
teste
the
smell
is
just
wonderfulland
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
most
dark
beers
even
i
have
to
admit
my
suprisethis
is
a
good
dark
beer
that
i
belive
everyone
should
try
or
try
again
it
has
been
a
couple
years
since
ive
had
a
guinness
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
soon
not
the
guinness
of
old
i
used
to
love
drinking
this
on
tap
since
its
even
better
than
in
the
can
but
i
then
noticed
i
was
getting
hangovers
i
think
it
might
be
because
of
the
preservatives
i
dont
know
well
ive
had
guinness
plenty
of
times
but
i
will
see
just
how
drinkable
this
is
tonight
seeing
how
its
super
bowl
sunday
and
i
bought
a
8
pack
not
impressed
d
nitrogen
does
work
wonders
for
beer
at
times
but
not
here
the
widget
is
pretty
much
spent
upon
the
opening
resulting
in
flat
beer
when
poured
not
my
choice
when
it
comes
to
st
patricks
day
very
good
gateway
stout
pretty
sure
many
of
us
were
introduced
to
this
before
drinking
good
stouts
hum
i
am
one
who
probably
is
so
accustomed
to
mass
produced
beers
in
the
usa
that
this
monster
will
never
ever
be
included
in
by
beer
to
drink
list
such
a
horrendous
hour
of
trying
to
swallow
this
tragedy
ugly
flat
mouthdrying
uneven
and
just
plain
gross
the
incredibly
overpowering
heaviness
was
such
that
i
truly
truly
considered
returning
it
to
the
bartender
i
trooped
on
though
and
finished
it
in
protest
an
ungodly
representaion
of
beer
and
will
never
voluntarily
consume
again
drinkability
i
couldnt
even
finish
one
of
these
if
this
is
the
essence
of
what
a
stout
is
then
im
not
a
fan
if
all
youve
got
is
this
then
get
me
a
glass
of
water
this
isnt
my
favorite
guinness
product
but
it
is
still
one
i
always
seem
to
come
back
to
poured
into
pint
glass
a
long
time
ago
before
i
discovered
that
guinness
is
not
suitable
for
my
vegetarian
diet
the
beer
is
dark
pitch
black
with
a
large
tan
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
chocolatebreadmalts
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
an
extra
dry
finish
i
used
to
drink
these
all
day
during
my
college
years
although
once
i
found
other
stouts
i
was
finished
still
one
of
my
favorites
d
very
drinkable
and
pairable
obviously
it
is
the
only
beer
routinely
mixed
with
almost
any
other
beer
under
the
sun
and
it
is
probably
the
most
often
cited
beer
for
culinary
purposes
d
like
i
said
watery
with
mild
flavor
and
low
alcohol
content
you
can
put
down
a
six
pack
without
blinking
but
for
10
i
wouldnt
recomend
it
d
highly
drinkable
stout
nothing
is
too
strong
in
this
beer
it
is
all
balanced
nicely
mouthfeel
and
drinkabiliy
are
exceptional
and
extraordinary
this
creamy
devine
beer
loves
company
singalongs
and
irish
blessings
a
true
legend
for
all
the
right
reasons
d
these
are
very
easy
to
go
through
for
me
this
is
a
good
stepping
off
point
for
lager
drinkers
looking
for
more
a
sentemental
favorite
of
mine
d
as
long
as
its
cold
there
is
nothing
offensive
so
i
had
no
problem
getting
a
pint
down
finaly
what
is
this
a
sort
of
bizarre
experiment
how
much
crappishness
can
be
bottledcanned
and
people
will
still
be
drinking
it
this
brew
hits
the
absolute
zero
on
quality
scale
he
guinness
has
gone
where
no
one
else
has
gone
before
overall
if
this
beer
is
being
rated
as
a
traditional
stout
it
falls
far
short
but
i
believe
that
guinness
draught
from
a
can
is
not
meant
at
all
to
taste
like
a
normal
stout
but
instead
like
a
can
of
nitro
guinness
this
makes
rating
difficult
because
i
am
not
sure
what
to
compare
it
to
i
think
people
either
love
guinness
for
what
it
is
or
disdain
it
because
it
is
not
a
typical
stout
take
your
pick
personally
i
love
this
beer
because
of
its
interesting
and
rich
history
and
because
of
the
marketing
involved
it
is
packaged
beautifully
and
looks
simply
wonderful
in
a
glass
so
it
is
watery
i
kind
of
think
it
is
refreshing
for
that
reason
no
it
will
never
be
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
but
i
dont
think
it
is
trying
to
be
guinness
is
guinness
most
people
out
there
have
had
this
the
simpsons
said
it
right
its
like
having
bog
water
and
chocolate
syrup
dark
color
tan
head
pours
forth
very
bland
stout
creamy
taste
though
i
can
always
drink
a
few
of
these
but
would
rather
have
something
else
most
days
d
i
can
see
other
people
drinking
this
no
problem
however
my
problem
is
that
there
just
isnt
enough
taste
to
it
it
tasted
too
watery
i
have
a
hard
time
getting
thru
one
mmmm
guinness
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
before
i
got
into
micros
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
appearance
dark
brown
black
with
a
huge
creamy
head
head
retention
is
very
good
it
stays
around
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
there
is
a
light
roasted
aroma
the
flavor
is
of
roasted
malts
and
bitter
coffee
this
is
fairly
watery
for
a
stout
but
it
still
has
a
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
the
mouthfeel
would
be
exceptional
if
the
body
wasnt
so
light
overall
this
is
kind
of
bland
compared
to
other
stouts
but
its
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
with
so
many
others
guinness
draught
was
my
first
foray
into
beer
other
than
american
adjunct
lagers
and
a
very
long
time
ago
i
loved
it
now
after
having
tried
so
many
great
aggressive
and
complex
stouts
yeti
and
fbs
to
name
just
two
guinness
draught
seems
like
water
i
have
to
admit
that
this
beer
was
and
remains
one
of
my
first
loves
id
never
tasted
anything
like
it
low
carbonation
black
milky
consistency
and
a
solid
nutty
flavor
that
had
me
at
the
first
sip
however
i
will
admit
that
this
beer
has
its
faults
the
burnt
woody
flavor
quickly
becomes
monotonous
the
taste
is
really
too
mild
for
its
heartiness
i
found
myself
wishing
for
a
bigger
flavor
with
more
depth
however
its
incredibly
drinkable
and
has
the
power
to
lure
beerhaters
out
of
their
caves
those
who
wish
for
a
stronger
more
nuanced
flavor
might
try
guinness
extra
stout
this
is
the
first
beer
i
got
into
when
i
turned
21
so
guinness
always
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
finally
took
the
time
to
review
one
my
tastes
have
changed
since
then
but
i
still
like
it
poured
it
into
a
tulip
style
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
looking
nitro
effect
to
it
while
being
poured
the
bubbles
slowly
work
their
way
to
the
top
whether
or
not
youre
a
fan
of
guinness
i
feel
everyone
should
agree
atleast
that
its
a
good
looking
beer
a
few
years
ago
i
would
have
rated
the
taste
and
smell
so
much
higher
but
pretty
average
now
its
generously
malted
very
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
when
let
back
down
to
room
temperature
you
can
slightly
smell
the
hop
but
you
really
have
to
look
for
it
in
the
taste
its
also
difficult
to
pick
up
on
the
hop
it
does
have
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
its
nothing
too
high
in
quality
but
well
blended
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
for
a
stout
it
does
feel
a
bit
watered
down
for
a
stout
its
very
drinkable
no
matter
what
the
occasion
not
my
favorite
beer
anymore
but
ill
still
never
turn
one
down
d
this
is
really
disappointing
i
recall
early
on
in
my
drinking
days
when
guinness
was
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
but
it
seems
to
have
gone
the
way
of
so
many
other
mass
produced
items
d
definitely
the
easiest
drinking
stout
i
have
ever
come
across
while
that
could
be
a
good
thing
depending
on
the
circumstances
typically
im
looking
for
something
a
little
more
substantial
with
a
stout
but
in
the
dry
irish
stout
cataegory
this
appears
to
be
the
norm
for
this
style
of
beer
anyways
this
one
pours
black
out
of
the
can
with
a
thin
creamy
head
that
lingers
smell
is
very
weak
taste
is
not
terrible
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
light
bitterness
predominiates
the
mouthfeel
has
always
been
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
as
i
prefer
my
stouts
a
little
more
creamychewy
even
low
abv
stout
as
the
one
could
benefit
from
a
rich
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
decent
but
in
my
experience
youll
feel
full
long
before
you
feel
a
buzz
d
nice
heavy
stout
it
goes
down
smoother
than
most
and
easy
to
throw
it
down
this
beer
is
pretty
much
the
exact
same
as
the
nitro
can
version
the
only
difference
is
that
maybe
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
more
chewy
and
thicker
and
the
darker
malts
were
well
maltier
all
in
all
the
product
is
the
same
as
the
can
and
i
prefer
neither
overall
guinness
isnt
the
grade
a
beer
i
remember
it
being
but
i
still
think
its
worthy
i
love
the
whole
event
of
pouring
a
pint
of
it
if
it
wasnt
for
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
i
think
this
would
be
the
same
as
any
other
middle
of
the
road
stout
overall
i
say
give
it
a
try
it
is
one
of
the
most
famous
beers
and
thats
for
a
reason
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
definatly
a
beer
that
you
sit
and
enjoy
for
long
periods
of
time
d
on
its
own
i
wouldnt
say
this
beer
is
overly
drinkable
but
as
a
mixer
im
a
huge
fan
which
is
the
main
reason
i
keep
them
around
the
house
when
mixed
with
other
beers
or
cider
guinness
cant
be
beat
d
it
is
drinkable
but
i
would
probably
go
to
the
corner
store
and
pick
up
another
brew
dr
easy
to
abuse
but
much
better
on
tap
with
friends
in
an
irish
themed
bar
d
very
drinkable
as
far
as
stouts
go
owing
to
its
slightly
watereddown
profile
guinness
gets
a
bad
rap
from
all
the
beer
snobs
on
here
but
for
a
macro
its
decent
mentioning
guinness
seems
to
elicit
a
response
from
most
people
but
canned
guinness
draught
leaves
something
to
be
desired
i
would
much
rather
take
the
extra
stout
especially
the
lovely
foreign
extra
i
enjoyed
so
in
jamaica
drinkabilityif
i
downed
one
of
these
itll
be
an
accomplishment
someone
will
be
getting
an
early
christmas
gift
ie
the
other
5
in
the
pack
drinkability
i
wish
i
could
pour
these
all
day
after
that
its
all
downhill
i
appreciate
the
effort
that
went
into
developing
the
nitrocan
but
the
beer
itself
is
lackluster
i
dont
mind
drinking
these
at
all
but
for
6
for
a
four
pack
a
total
dud
overall
i
could
sum
it
up
best
by
saying
all
bark
no
bite
nice
buzz
nice
taste
nice
smell
nice
look
real
enjoyability
for
a
darker
popular
beer
its
my
new
goto
beer
is
smooth
one
of
the
smoothest
creamiest
beers
ive
ever
drank
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
really
sessionable
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
there
is
mild
bitterness
and
some
nice
subtle
roast
character
some
chocolate
like
flavors
and
a
great
medium
body
drinkability
is
high
and
mouthfeel
is
good
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
but
too
light
not
really
a
stout
i
will
not
rate
this
beer
in
the
normal
astmd
fashion
this
beer
was
the
gateway
beer
for
me
into
good
quality
beers
this
beer
really
expanded
my
horizons
what
gives
it
the
the
nice
tang
is
the
soured
beer
that
is
added
to
it
i
recently
am
on
a
hiatus
from
drinking
stouts
but
this
was
my
staple
for
a
cheap
good
tasting
stout
when
i
started
leaving
the
coors
and
the
other
light
beers
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
one
of
my
tops
for
a
long
time
f
semi
bitter
earthy
a
little
sweet
lingering
creamy
feel
and
taste
some
lingering
fruity
flavors
and
sweet
syrupy
like
flavors
doesnt
smell
like
anything
the
taste
is
unique
a
thin
stout
but
likeable
doesnt
leave
a
whole
lot
to
talk
about
mouthfeel
wise
its
rather
simple
actually
drinkability
very
drinkable
lots
of
them
blah
not
going
to
finish
this
its
that
bad
ok
really
who
hasnt
had
this
irish
car
bombs
the
other
night
and
it
was
so
good
i
havent
had
one
since
i
joined
ba
and
its
just
like
i
remembered
it
smooth
low
alky
and
enjoyable
they
go
down
so
smooth
that
you
dont
think
of
the
in
it
cause
its
so
low
doesnt
matter
it
was
good
and
when
nothing
else
is
around
i
grab
one
this
really
isnt
quite
the
guinness
that
i
remember
loving
so
much
from
tastes
when
i
was
younger
maybe
its
because
ive
had
better
stouts
since
then
its
not
a
horrible
beer
by
any
means
but
its
just
not
something
to
get
particularly
excited
over
and
its
on
the
bland
side
ill
admit
guiness
is
still
one
of
the
prettiest
pours
when
done
correctly
nearly
pitch
black
body
with
creamy
khaki
colored
head
as
always
good
retention
minimal
lacing
however
smell
is
of
burnt
grains
dark
coffee
beans
sliglty
nutty
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
taste
is
of
faint
dark
slightly
burnt
grains
and
coffee
hints
of
chocolate
nuts
molasses
and
some
funky
sourlike
thing
going
on
note
was
amazed
to
come
on
and
read
so
many
reviews
describing
this
quality
i
did
not
remeber
this
at
all
last
time
i
had
a
pint
nitro
gives
it
a
creamy
once
percieved
as
thick
lightmedium
body
which
works
well
with
this
beer
not
bad
the
little
sour
thing
concerns
me
and
my
advanced
palate
would
love
a
bump
up
in
the
dark
malt
profile
but
solid
d
wonderfully
wonderfully
drinkable
concoction
i
love
fresh
guinness
ontap
was
kinda
watery
going
down
but
it
is
smooth
it
has
a
thin
slightly
sour
finish
to
it
somewhat
drinkable
due
to
its
smoothness
good
stout
but
better
in
dublin
of
course
poured
into
a
pint
glass
coffee
black
with
a
glowing
tan
head
that
was
present
until
the
glass
was
empty
and
even
left
some
foam
behind
smelled
like
a
roasted
malt
with
very
faint
coffee
tasted
very
bland
slightly
sweet
very
dry
and
a
burnt
aftertaste
long
ago
had
viewed
this
as
a
very
heavy
beer
but
the
perception
is
just
that
an
illusion
a
light
beer
with
a
dry
thick
body
drinkability
is
one
of
the
stronger
aspects
of
this
beer
not
bad
overall
there
are
much
better
stouts
for
the
style
murphys
is
better
though
available
only
in
cans
in
my
part
of
the
world
availabilty
here
is
the
crucial
criterion
i
cant
think
of
any
part
of
the
world
where
one
cannot
find
guinness
on
tap
even
in
wv
it
can
be
found
at
least
in
independent
restaraunts
and
bars
when
in
doubt
guinness
stout
i
still
think
this
is
a
great
session
beer
this
review
is
for
the
nitrocan
version
but
guinness
draught
is
positively
best
from
the
spigot
and
fresh
poured
into
a
glass
tumbler
it
produces
a
large
thick
brown
head
with
fair
lacing
the
color
is
very
dark
almost
black
brown
the
aroma
is
of
mild
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
and
slightly
malty
the
carbonation
is
light
with
a
nice
smooth
feel
in
the
mouth
i
prefer
this
among
the
majors
one
finds
in
the
kinds
of
bars
and
restaurants
one
gets
dragged
to
by
ones
friends
where
it
is
often
served
from
the
nitrocan
this
is
one
of
my
first
real
beers
to
taste
appearance
is
very
nice
very
dark
and
suttle
smell
abite
like
coffe
and
tast
abit
like
coffie
very
robust
flavor
one
those
you
need
to
try
for
yourself
beers
some
like
it
or
others
dont
maybe
scared
of
it
but
very
majestic
for
me
hope
this
helps
on
a
side
note
i
remember
the
first
time
i
had
guinness
i
just
turned
21
and
caught
the
cramps
play
in
chicago
at
the
vic
i
had
like
5
of
them
because
thats
all
i
saw
people
drinking
then
i
found
out
they
also
served
old
style
i
switched
to
old
style
bad
idea
it
was
85
degrees
in
there
and
i
was
wearing
a
leather
jacket
upon
going
outside
i
went
on
the
red
line
and
on
the
chicago
street
exit
i
blew
old
stlye
and
guinness
over
the
cement
and
bench
in
front
of
me
people
just
stepped
over
it
like
it
wasnt
a
big
deal
oh
the
memories
d
always
a
great
session
beer
for
long
movie
marathons
has
the
smoothness
to
be
able
to
drink
one
after
another
with
an
adequate
flavor
profile
to
keep
your
attention
basic
and
straightforward
but
just
plain
good
beer
drinkability
classic
not
a
prize
winner
but
easy
to
consume
in
large
amounts
with
different
kinds
of
foods
d
if
there
arent
any
other
stout
options
this
ones
just
stout
enough
to
tide
you
over
i
have
to
say
although
this
beer
is
not
great
it
is
pretty
drinkable
for
sure
decent
for
the
style
but
doesnt
really
excite
me
drinkability
goes
well
with
just
about
anything
this
beer
is
a
classic
that
is
extremely
drinkable
i
will
always
reach
for
it
i
love
when
they
leave
a
few
fingers
of
that
famous
creamy
foam
to
let
coat
the
glass
you
either
love
or
hate
the
darkness
of
this
beverage
but
it
does
not
have
that
coffee
flavor
that
one
might
think
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
not
to
thick
that
you
cant
keep
the
rounds
coming
the
nice
thing
about
this
beverage
is
you
can
have
it
on
a
hot
or
cold
day
not
much
going
on
with
this
had
a
large
glass
from
tap
from
a
hot
wing
chain
restaurant
looks
sorta
badass
but
really
is
weak
and
flavorless
very
dark
pour
adequate
head
not
a
good
environment
for
aroma
so
not
sure
its
fair
to
rate
but
didnt
get
much
has
a
nice
creaminess
but
was
really
searching
for
something
recognizable
on
the
taste
maybe
a
bit
of
roasted
grain
but
didnt
really
get
malt
or
hops
i
finished
it
but
didnt
get
another
d
i
have
literally
never
enjoyed
guinness
and
now
i
think
i
never
will
no
point
in
wasting
time
and
money
on
it
in
the
future
d
flavourless
and
weak
tastes
like
bitter
water
d
goes
down
easy
can
drink
these
all
day
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
at
one
time
however
i
feel
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
on
the
market
i
have
had
guinness
straight
from
the
can
from
the
bottle
on
tap
to
start
i
would
say
i
love
guinness
a
smooth
creamy
head
with
good
lacing
taste
has
a
mild
burnt
flavor
but
the
chocolate
levels
it
all
out
nicely
it
has
a
very
good
drinkability
in
my
opinion
over
all
stout
flavor
is
great
i
prefer
this
stout
far
more
then
bodingtons
or
murphys
over
great
beer
overall
pretty
weak
brew
after
a
5
year
break
just
as
weak
as
i
remembered
the
time
for
this
beer
is
st
pattys
day
or
in
a
pub
in
ireland
otherwise
i
can
find
something
better
4
2
abv
tasty
but
not
overwhelming
my
idea
of
the
perfect
session
beer
a
decent
beer
and
its
a
classic
in
terms
of
drinkability
guinness
is
a
fairly
easy
drinking
stout
the
low
abv
lends
itself
to
a
sessionable
beer
and
it
doesnt
seem
too
imposing
i
certainly
enjoy
guinness
and
while
the
review
may
not
do
it
justice
ill
take
it
over
most
beers
was
really
disappointed
in
this
purchase
dont
know
if
they
changed
something
in
the
recipe
or
if
ive
just
grown
as
a
beer
drinker
but
this
is
just
an
average
beer
everyones
first
step
into
the
wide
world
of
stouts
a
decent
brew
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
great
smell
and
how
could
one
ever
ignore
that
mysterious
black
emanating
beneath
the
offwhite
two
finger
head
the
only
thing
that
really
stands
out
is
the
drinkability
otherwise
a
good
beer
if
you
are
at
a
crappy
bar
and
you
want
a
decent
dark
beer
d
oh
baby
this
beer
goes
extremely
smoothly
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
had
this
beer
at
multiple
pubs
in
ireland
before
i
went
to
ireland
i
thought
this
beer
was
mediocre
i
heard
alot
of
people
insult
it
and
id
had
it
once
or
twice
it
tasted
much
better
in
ireland
on
tap
than
america
and
the
great
dark
ruby
red
color
was
amazing
the
head
doesnt
go
away
until
the
beer
is
finished
which
i
have
never
had
in
a
beer
the
taste
was
great
and
chocolatey
in
an
odd
way
it
is
filled
with
so
many
different
flavors
i
love
to
drink
this
beer
now
and
is
truly
my
favorite
this
is
not
the
best
stout
that
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
highly
overrated
imo
d
this
stuff
is
too
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
really
a
pleasant
experience
on
my
palate
it
looks
great
but
thats
it
i
still
like
it
but
theres
plenty
of
other
stuff
to
drink
thankfully
it
is
because
of
this
beer
that
i
realize
that
now
overall
this
is
my
pub
quiz
and
before
football
match
the
only
real
football
guys
beer
i
always
drink
it
in
nice
ambiance
in
good
company
the
beer
itself
however
is
not
such
a
great
experience
it
is
just
too
flat
a
decent
stout
but
there
are
so
many
many
many
better
ones
very
smooth
beer
some
complain
of
bitterness
but
i
think
its
just
right
only
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
which
i
think
works
with
this
beer
great
overall
closest
thing
to
a
draft
guinness
you
can
get
at
home
okay
had
it
right
after
the
guinness
original
so
it
was
kind
of
a
let
down
after
the
amazing
real
thing
all
in
all
good
solid
dark
appearance
in
a
pilsner
with
a
nice
creamy
head
smell
and
taste
was
a
watered
down
version
of
the
original
with
the
toasted
nose
completely
missing
even
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
ordinary
i
would
pass
this
one
on
d
guinness
is
really
really
bitter
it
is
hard
to
drink
if
youre
looking
for
balance
at
all
served
in
a
nonic
poured
two
shades
shy
of
black
with
some
deep
ruby
highlights
around
the
base
of
the
glass
one
inch
dense
solid
offwhite
cap
eventually
settled
into
a
quarter
inch
head
excellent
retention
with
some
strands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
session
nose
was
mild
maybe
some
chocolate
malt
but
barely
detectable
taste
consistent
with
nose
chocolate
malt
with
a
kiss
of
hops
to
break
up
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
was
mediumlight
somewhat
watery
but
also
creamy
at
the
same
time
finish
was
fairly
dry
an
incredibly
easy
and
sessionable
beer
and
a
standard
go
to
when
the
draft
list
is
lacking
pours
super
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
it
takes
several
minutes
to
pour
a
proper
guinness
from
a
nitro
tap
as
the
bubbles
have
to
settle
throughout
head
is
thick
rich
and
has
a
high
mininiscus
over
the
top
of
the
glass
nose
is
very
toasted
with
coffee
notes
taste
is
smooth
and
consistently
good
there
are
no
hints
of
tin
skunk
or
over
bittered
the
balance
is
really
good
and
while
it
goes
down
rich
it
isnt
that
filling
i
wish
i
could
have
that
quality
all
the
time
as
i
would
drink
guinness
more
decided
to
give
the
bottle
a
try
pours
near
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
nose
has
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
not
much
else
taste
is
quite
light
yet
bitter
no
better
or
worse
than
the
can
version
body
reminds
me
of
carbonated
water
drnkable
but
not
very
enjoyable
i
drank
8
pints
without
retching
its
drinkable
enough
watery
plain
boring
beer
i
hesitate
to
call
it
a
beer
i
hope
you
have
saved
your
money
cheers
with
a
bottle
of
something
else
contrary
to
their
popular
and
longstanding
slogan
guinness
is
not
good
for
you
it
certainly
isnt
good
for
me
anyhow
the
world
of
stout
offers
far
more
excitement
and
experience
than
this
that
includes
the
variety
of
stronger
guinness
foreign
export
beers
brewed
for
overseas
markets
guinness
may
have
set
the
benchmark
for
stouts
but
they
set
it
really
really
low
this
ones
pretty
much
the
same
as
ive
had
any
other
way
except
that
the
nitro
can
really
adds
some
body
and
smoothness
to
what
without
the
nitro
effect
is
a
disappointingly
thin
and
lackluster
stout
in
terms
especially
of
mouthfeel
guinness
was
one
of
my
first
reviews
on
ba
and
ive
only
just
gotten
to
having
one
from
the
nitro
bottle
again
to
review
it
guinness
has
been
a
staple
of
my
bargoing
experiences
ever
since
ive
started
going
to
bars
my
very
first
guinness
was
from
a
proper
pub
in
dublin
ireland
and
it
was
delicious
and
filling
the
pints
ive
had
since
here
in
the
united
states
have
not
matched
my
first
guinness
adventure
but
i
suspect
that
has
quite
a
lot
to
do
with
the
overall
experience
i
had
in
ireland
this
is
a
beer
i
will
continue
to
revisit
as
long
as
i
drink
after
i
tried
guinness
extra
stout
and
thought
it
was
decent
i
figured
id
give
the
draught
a
try
and
what
a
let
down
it
was
they
mot
color
this
beer
to
get
that
dark
color
because
i
know
its
not
from
the
amount
of
malts
used
verdict
chances
are
if
youre
reading
this
you
know
exactly
what
its
like
to
have
a
pint
of
guinness
draught
inoffensive
and
generally
uninteresting
yet
highly
recognizable
and
iconic
its
quite
the
paradox
just
the
kind
of
paradox
thats
perfect
to
ponder
over
a
familiar
pint
d
high
marks
for
drinkability
here
goes
down
super
smooth
especially
with
the
light
carbonation
in
some
ways
this
beer
seems
both
over
and
under
rated
at
the
same
time
its
not
the
meal
in
a
can
the
average
bud
light
drinker
hypes
it
up
to
be
which
marketers
are
all
to
happy
to
go
along
with
it
also
isnt
terrible
either
it
doesnt
have
a
big
flavour
by
any
means
but
it
has
at
least
some
flavour
and
doesnt
taste
bad
a
good
session
choice
when
nothing
else
is
around
a
classic
and
a
must
have
at
least
once
drinkability
very
good
ive
gotten
this
several
times
and
im
sure
i
will
get
it
again
i
really
like
this
brew
the
widget
makes
for
a
crazy
head
the
retention
is
seldom
matched
from
tasting
notes
recorded
27
jul
2009
all
in
all
a
basic
stout
thats
on
the
lighter
side
but
decent
nontheless
the
extra
stout
i
think
its
called
is
much
better
than
this
imho
d
my
go
to
session
beer
when
out
very
easy
to
drink
guinness
draught
in
the
nitrocan
is
more
of
an
everyonceinawhile
beer
for
me
because
i
genuinely
enjoy
the
lighter
creamier
weaker
guinness
some
times
most
days
its
not
my
favorite
beer
but
its
definately
a
good
session
pick
for
me
the
only
deterrent
is
the
price
good
beer
but
not
always
worth
the
craft
beer
price
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
only
as
a
last
resort
if
there
are
no
other
good
options
well
first
off
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
likely
its
best
feature
beautifully
black
with
an
ohsocreamy
looking
tan
head
retention
is
legendary
and
some
very
nice
thick
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
the
smell
emanating
from
this
beer
is
unfortunately
somewhat
muted
what
i
am
able
to
discern
are
subtle
notes
of
bready
buttery
malts
chocolate
and
some
coffee
taste
is
more
pronounced
with
lots
of
bread
and
butter
up
front
with
the
dark
roasted
chocolate
notes
picking
up
midsip
resulting
in
a
finish
that
is
roasty
with
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
very
creamy
with
not
a
whole
lot
in
terms
of
noticeable
carbonation
this
stout
goes
down
smooth
drinkability
is
another
excellent
quality
of
this
beer
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
this
stuff
till
the
cows
come
home
overall
sometimes
nothing
goes
down
like
it
it
could
be
more
pronounced
flavour
wise
however
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
silkysmooth
easy
drinking
stout
its
hard
to
beat
truly
a
classic
id
love
to
try
it
closer
to
the
source
after
pouring
into
an
ale
glass
the
brew
produced
a
rich
vibrant
head
that
is
tan
in
color
the
body
of
the
beer
is
rich
and
dark
after
the
beer
settled
about
onehalf
inch
of
head
remained
in
addition
a
nice
layer
of
lace
is
clinging
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
both
malty
and
hoppy
the
flavor
is
both
sweet
and
salty
with
a
nice
essence
of
hops
the
beer
is
creamy
and
feels
very
delightful
in
the
mouth
overall
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
classic
that
should
be
used
as
benchmark
for
measuring
other
stouts
the
mouthfeel
is
average
for
a
stout
not
a
lot
going
on
but
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
average
nothing
to
ward
you
off
but
not
as
big
and
bold
as
some
others
d
this
beer
is
just
way
too
watery
it
ruins
it
for
me
flavor
and
aroma
are
very
subtle
almost
bland
this
is
basically
a
marcostout
aromaless
flavorless
but
easily
chuggable
there
are
too
many
great
stout
available
to
waste
my
time
on
this
one
again
can
pours
a
dark
black
body
with
a
thick
and
frothy
caramel
coloured
head
aroma
is
slightly
roasted
malty
but
pretty
much
nondescript
any
aroma
here
is
very
mild
taste
is
semi
sweet
malt
flavours
with
some
mild
roasted
sugary
flavours
as
well
very
light
and
watery
d
definitely
a
beer
i
can
have
all
night
long
its
easy
drinking
unless
the
only
beer
you
have
every
had
is
watery
lager
first
beer
ive
ever
had
on
tap
much
better
than
in
the
bottle
same
taste
chocolatey
and
rich
but
the
mouth
feel
is
so
much
creamier
has
a
nice
soothing
appeal
to
it
as
it
washes
down
your
throat
good
carbonation
enough
to
give
it
slight
bitterness
but
not
enough
to
keep
you
from
enjoying
the
texture
if
you
see
it
on
tap
and
have
never
had
it
before
id
give
it
it
a
try
if
you
dont
like
guinness
in
the
first
place
it
probably
wont
change
your
mind
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
mild
and
easy
drinking
some
roasted
malts
just
a
touch
of
coffee
feels
full
bodied
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer

sheas

072509
90
degree
heat
and
the
wife
i
needed
a
rest
on
our
way
to
the
mutter
museum
awesome
place
especially
if
you
like
syphilisrelated
lesions
and
other
medical
maladies
im
hot
tired
ready
for
a
cold
pint
something
light
and
guinness
would
supposedly
fit
the
bill
overall
i
was
disappointed
appearance
is
perfect
and
aroma
is
very
good
but
somehow
its
more
watery
than
i
remember
reading
other
reviews
its
obvious
im
not
alone
in
my
opinion
of
course
considering
my
last
review
was
of
fbs
im
probably
expecting
too
much
taste
is
good
pleasant
roasted
malt
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
silky
but
theres
a
wateriness
that
dulls
both
and
leads
to
point
deductions
drinkability
is
okay
but
i
only
had
one
and
switched
to
sabl
ill
drink
it
again
but
probably
not
until
st
paddys
day
and
then
only
if
beamish
isnt
available
sure
one
can
idle
away
the
hours
while
sipping
or
swigging
but
i
have
no
such
desire
gotta
say
compared
to
the
pub
cans
with
the
little
widget
or
on
draft
this
bottle
version
is
spot
on
with
the
rest
i
know
its
actually
meant
to
be
drunk
out
of
the
bottle
and
i
did
take
a
few
swigs
and
well
its
not
as
good
but
it
works
really
the
only
thing
negative
about
this
is
the
11
2oz
bottle
seems
to
be
a
sneaky
way
of
getting
you
to
pay
more
for
less
drinkability
ive
had
better
stouts
if
offered
id
pass
this
one
up
if
found
in
the
fridge
i
might
give
it
a
try
d
very
easy
to
drink
much
like
water
is
poured
dark
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
had
staying
power
i
could
smell
coffee
the
beer
tasted
remarkable
similar
to
pool
water
i
swear
i
could
even
get
a
slight
chlorine
taste
that
may
be
what
some
reported
as
coffee
taste
no
body
as
far
as
drinkability
you
could
drink
it
like
water
too
a
case
of
a
beer
being
average
or
above
in
all
categories
but
taste
so
the
2
4
rating
is
deceiving
definitely
not
recommended
drinkability
though
its
thick
body
has
earned
it
the
liquid
bread
moniker
i
can
drink
quite
a
lot
of
this
it
goes
down
smooth
and
isnt
so
oppressive
that
i
cant
have
another
it
smells
and
taste
like
coffee
but
compared
to
other
stouts
its
very
weak
last
time
i
had
this
in
the
bottle
i
was
shocked
maybe
it
was
just
a
bad
case
but
i
think
my
palet
has
changed
this
seemed
more
watery
and
empty
than
i
remember
its
still
an
ok
beer
and
i
still
like
it
better
than
other
macro
beers
but
this
is
jumping
down
on
my
list
while
the
on
tap
version
moved
up
a
little
funny
a
few
years
ago
i
would
have
said
guinness
was
a
good
beer
oh
education
d
quite
ok
overall
probably
would
have
one
but
not
more
thatn
that
from
a
can
once
poured
a
nice
dark
appearance
with
a
foam
top
it
has
a
nice
smooth
bitter
taste
throughout
with
a
distinct
roast
flavor
that
leaves
an
aftertaste
creamy
and
not
thin
overall
good
choice
for
any
occasion
and
one
of
the
better
commercial
beers
guiness
extra
stout
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
beer
is
only
good
for
introducing
people
to
something
other
than
standard
yellow
fiz
im
really
dissapointed
with
this
brew
d
this
really
is
an
awesome
kickback
beer
great
for
those
hot
days
hard
to
believe
that
250
years
after
arthur
gave
this
gift
to
the
world
that
guinness
is
still
kicking
ass
cheers
most
of
the
finer
restaurants
i
frequent
may
not
have
a
good
selection
of
microbrews
bit
they
generally
do
have
guinness
on
tap
settling
for
a
pint
of
guinness
is
not
a
difficult
choice
what
can
i
say
about
the
beer
that
piqued
my
interest
in
something
other
then
bmc
it
looks
fantastic
in
a
glass
the
head
is
enormous
and
the
color
is
dark
brown
almost
bordering
on
black
the
smell
is
faint
caramel
with
hints
of
malt
the
flavor
is
similar
to
ice
coffee
hardly
any
trace
of
alcohol
its
as
smooth
as
water
going
down
which
is
why
i
like
to
start
my
evening
with
one
or
three
of
these
i
enjoy
this
beer
even
if
its
not
real
sophisticated
d
i
put
down
alot
of
these
guys
do
due
the
calorie
and
carb
content
compared
to
most
light
beers
ive
tasted
im
actually
quite
happy
this
stuff
is
available
all
over
good
weekday
beer
as
far
as
taste
goes
not
good
not
bad
its
ok
but
i
still
drink
around
58
cans
a
week
shrug
in
truth
i
think
guinness
has
earned
a
place
in
my
heart
as
one
of
my
favorite
beers
on
tap
i
dont
think
i
would
rather
drink
much
of
anything
else
its
very
complex
in
the
sense
of
its
different
levels
and
craft
even
though
it
is
considered
a
fairly
commercial
beer
it
still
has
that
craft
and
care
feeling
everytime
you
drink

highly

just
a

something

and
definitely

spot
on
a
warm
sunny
day
cheers
i
dont
care
much
for
this
style
in
general
but
for
what
it
is
this
isnt
terrible
boring
for
sure
but
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
but
ultimately
disappointing
however
though
there
are
better
examples
of
dry
irish
stout
out
there
this
is
not
awful
and
quite
often
its
the
best
thing
on
the
menu
so
i
have
certainly
sessioned
a
few
this
is
not
even
worth
a
proper
review
mouthfeel
horrible
not
much
for
smell
and
ive
seen
it
in
a
glass
cascading
blah
blah
blah
its
a
nitro
it
sucks
waterycreamy
its
like
half
carbonated
stale
chocolate
milk
and
a
hint
of
bird
shit
if
you
have
never
tried
it
dont
take
an
iced
chocolate
coffee
let
the
ice
meltadd
soda
water
and
then
let
it
sit
and
go
flat
for
48
hours
then
you
will
have
brewed
your
own
guinness
draught
some
charred
barley
but
like
most
from
this
style
it
is
on
the
easy
drinking
creamy
laid
back
watered
down
tart
taste
milky
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
is
average
just
because
i
cant
see
myself
looking
forward
to
this
or
pursuing
it
any
time
soon
once
again
another
brew
id
prefer
to
try
on
tap
without
the
nitro
blasting
ball
but
for
this
review
in
a
can
its
simply
uneventfull
had
this
on
tap
tonight
from
a
place
with
a
pretty
limited
selection
man
i
dont
recall
guinness
tasting
so
well
bad
guess
its
been
years
and
my
tastes
have
come
a
long
way
as
i
used
to
enjoy
this
it
just
seemed
watery
flavorless
and
quite
boring
actually
the
look
is
still
there
a
nice
black
with
a
brownishblack
foam
the
aroma
is
there
but
the
taste
just
wasnt
its
like
drinking
a
good
stout
diluted
with
about
5
parts
water
its
black
water
d
easy
to
quaff
not
boozy
in
the
least
bit
sessionable
for
sure
but
there
are
many
other
great
sessionable
stouts
that
are
more
complex
and
flavorful
still
a
classic
entry
stout
and
nothing
can
beat
that
gorgeous
cascade
effect
from
a
freshly
pulled
pint
easily
guinness
draught
is
in
its
best
form
coming
off
of
a
nitrotap
drinkability
overall
pretty
good
havent
had
much
lately
but
still
pretty
good
a
good
beer
it
is
the
standard
of
ireland
after
all
but
id
pay
6
for
a
draft
pint
any
day
of
the
week
as
long
as
the
can
is
near
room
temperature
the
subtle
taste
and
aroma
will
show
much
better
than
the
icecold
recommendation
personally
a
little
more
salt
such
as
what
you
find
in
a
beamish
would
really
highlight
this
stout
well
cant
have
st
paddys
day
without
it
d
a
basically
good
stout
above
average
for
the
style
i
would
probably
pick
this
if
in
the
mood
for
a
dry
stout
its
best
quality
by
far
is
its
appearance
wow
very
impressive
when
i
was
trying
this
beer
i
wasnt
really
in
the
mood
for
its
style
but
who
turns
down
a
free
beer
that
is
the
reason
i
didnt
give
it
a
lower
rating
i
can
see
when
i
would
be
in
the
mood
for
this
kind
of
beer
maybe
on
a
different
occasion
overall
a
better
then
average
beer
d
very
good
bland
but
very
sessionable
feel
is
the
other
bright
point
i
like
the
full
creamy
body
to
it
too
bad
its
so
low
on
aroma
and
flavorfor
any
style
of
beer
not
a
beer
ill
choose
to
come
back
to
often
id
like
to
try
more
of
the
dry
irish
stout
style
to
compare
pours
an
almost
pitch
black
with
ruby
red
highlights
smell
is
faintly
of
coffee
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
not
much
body
and
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
gross
tasting
nitro
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
low
alcohol
and
decent
flavor
make
this
a
good
beer
when
there
are
no
other
choices
i
would
not
seek
this
out
specifically
but
its
ok
every
once
in
awhile
the
taste
is
not
what
you
expect
its
very
thick
in
the
mouth
but
thin
tasting
slightly
chocolatey
with
a
bitter
end
none
of
the
sweetness
in
the
nose
overall
this
beer
is
a
middle
of
the
road
irish
dry
stout
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
always
a
good
standby
when
other
options
are
lacking
drinkability
just
like
water
good
that
it
is
only
4
2
d
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
pick
out
of
the
fridge
i
can
see
the
drinkability
and
great
popularity
of
this
but
just
isnt
for
me
had
this
guy
poured
from
one
of
the
16
oz
cans
into
a
talll
beer
mug
i
have
no
idea
why
so
many
people
score
this
low
on
appearance
its
a
very
nice
looking
beer
solid
black
with
a
thick
creamy
half
inch
tan
head
that
stays
the
whole
time
leaving
massive
amounts
of
lacing
amber
bubbles
that
go
backwards
due
to
the
whole
nitro
tap
thing
how
could
this
score
under
4
5
smells
great
at
first
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
chocolate
very
inviting
tastes
very
dry
as
is
appropirate
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
but
creamy
as
it
warms
the
smell
proves
to
be
less
complex
as
you
might
hope
for
in
this
style
but
its
still
pleasant
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
deserves
its
global
following
i
think
there
is
no
need
to
do
a
review
i
dont
drink
guinness
that
much
over
here
even
though
i
think
its
a
great
beer
out
of
the
can
and
from
the
odd
pub
that
has
it
on
tap
here
but
in
dublin
i
had
it
just
about
with
every
meal
and
its
amazing
really
a
pleasure
to
have
and
the
bartenders
all
know
how
to
properly
pour
a
pint
unlike
over
here
just
saying
serving
suggestion
nitrotap
pour
by
a
bartender
that
knows
how
to
pour
guinness
correctly
into
an
authentic
guinness
pint
glass
a
thing
of
beauty
drinkabilitys
always
good
on
a
guinness
taste
slightly
bitter
taste
with
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
thinner
then
the
appearance
may
give
away
but
to
has
a
good
mouthfeel
the
draught
however
cant
compare
to
the
specialty
drinkability
due
to
the
smooth
nature
and
relatively
low
abv
a
great
session
beer
is
fearr
tu
de
guinness
this
is
the
stout
for
the
masses
really
but
its
appeal
as
thick
solid
lord
of
dark
matter
is
hype
not
reality
in
actuality
it
makes
me
want
to
retch
the
more
i
drink
its
bitter
and
unpleasant
without
being
complex
not
all
that
mouthfeel
after
such
a
dense
head
the
actual
body
is
very
light
with
a
creamy
carbonation
d
wouldnt
deny
another
but
wouldnt
be
first
choice
d
i
know
people
like
to
hate
on
the
nitro
bottle
but
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
pretty
close
approximation
of
the
draught
experiencein
other
words
solid
but
underwhelming
its
ok
for
an
oocasional
change
of
pace
but
id
never
make
it
my
goto
beer
this
is
straight
from
the
bottle
says
so
right
on
the
lable
drink
straight
from
the
bottle
so
that
is
what
i
did
what
a
let
down
its
not
even
possible
for
me
to
explain
the
let
down
whatever
the
gizmo
does
it
doesnt
make
drinking
this
stout
from
the
bottle
enjoyable
no
foam
in
the
mouth
rather
thin
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
great
flavor
sort
of
watery
i
dont
know
just
dont
expect
anything
and
dont
drink
straight
from
the
bottle
guinness
is
never
my
first
choice
at
a
bar
but
not
a
bad
beer
if
theres
nothing
else
its
quality
and
a
very
distinguished
taste
the
experience
of
ordering
a
guinness
with
the
head
and
watching
it
change
colors
is
better
than
actually
drinking
it
unfortunately
the
coffee
type
flavor
is
nice
but
the
beer
could
really
use
more
alcohol
it
can
hardly
be
called
a
stout
at
4
2
abv
if
they
boosted
it
up
to
6
or
7
it
would
be
a
much
better
beer
i
feel
nice
flavor
of
slightly
burnt
malts
a
bit
thin
perhaps
but
not
nearly
as
watery
as
ive
seen
on
tap
at
times
which
helps
the
feel
and
drink
nice
medium
body
and
smooth
flavor
without
the
bitterness
ive
experienced
at
times
on
tap
as
well
the
can
i
assume
is
universal
alas
the
can
is
a
good
vehicle
to
enjoy
a
guinness
without
the
expense
of
travel
though
at
a
slight
cost
in
flavor
to
a
good
pour
near
the
source
this
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
but
theres
not
enough
to
it
that
im
really
enjoying
drinking
it
i
would
probably
have
another
in
a
sitting
if
its
the
best
thing
on
tap
overall
this
beer
is
nice
but
everything
about
it
is
too
mild
plenty
of
other
stouts
irish
dry
or
otherwise
that
are
every
bit
as
easy
drinking
but
pack
a
better
flavour
punch
pours
a
beautiful
deep
black
with
a
stellar
nitro
head
that
looks
like
a
fluffy
pillow
of
goodness
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
ethanol
taste
is
very
underwhelming
if
i
had
my
eyes
closed
id
think
i
were
drinking
bud
light
tastes
like
a
watered
down
version
of
a
roasted
malt
tea
body
is
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
drinkability
is
average
i
can
see
it
being
easy
to
throw
a
few
of
these
back
without
being
bogged
down
i
guess
this
is
what
we
have
to
put
up
with
in
the
states
apparently
mass
production
outside
of
ireland
has
harmed
the
recipe
of
this
classic
i
hope
to
one
day
try
the
real
thing
what
happened
over
the
past
ten
years
my
drinking
career
it
seems
as
though
this
beer
has
been
getting
worse
and
worse
guinness
were
my
first
beers
and
they
were
fantastic
now
the
inconsistent
anything
but
black
color
and
weak
head
are
breaking
my
heart
the
smell
is
gone
and
the
smooth
creamy
taste
is
more
of
a
metallic
sip
of
tap
water
i
loved
this
beer
and
feel
personally
wronged
by
those
who
have
watered
down
this
liquid
tradition
the
only
remenant
of
the
old
guinness
is
the
way
the
nitro
makes
it
feel
when
you
drink
it
but
the
mouthfeel
simply
cant
stand
alone
overall
its
ok
theyve
built
an
empire
on
reputation
i
like
guinness
but
it
doesnt
really
stack
up
nowadays
with
so
many
other
options
if
you
are
committed
to
drinking
the
regular
guinness
draught
opt
for
the
cans
or
if
you
must
stick
with
the
brand
buy
the
extra
stout
in
bottles
instead
but
in
all
honesty
do
yourself
a
favor
and
buy
a
more
flavorful
stout
di
drank
three
pints
pretty
fast
but
i
think
thats
because
i
kept
searching
for
flavor
nowhere
near
the
extra
stout
in
the
bottle
and
cant
hold
a
shaky
whimpering
candle
to
oharas
ontap
if
you
want
real
ids
from
the
country
of
origin
and
its
available
grab
that
one
still
if
i
had
a
bucket
of
oysters
on
a
nice
spring
day
id
probably
still
look
for
oharas
or
pick
up
a
sixer
of
smuttys
robust
porter
which
is
really
a
stout
i
think
it
pours
a
deep
brown
to
light
black
in
color
the
classic
cascading
action
of
guiness
followed
when
it
was
poured
into
the
glass
there
is
a
white
tone
to
the
beer
as
it
churns
and
then
it
culminates
in
a
thick
frothy
head
very
smooth
flavor
even
if
its
unremarkable
to
some
it
has
just
a
slight
hint
of
roasted
malts
and
grains
but
you
almost
have
to
be
searching
for
it
as
i
mentioned
it
is
very
tough
to
grade
an
old
standard
that
is
so
familiar
you
could
certainly
find
a
lot
of
beers
that
dont
stack
up
to
guiness
you
could
also
find
many
that
are
superior
md
silky
finish
with
light
carbonation
almost
flat
mouth
feel
overall
not
worth
the
hype
or
cost
for
me
the
taste
is
similar
being
mostly
water
with
light
burnt
toast
and
very
faint
hints
of
soil
coffee
its
watery
thin
and
bland
so
boring
its
barely
even
one
dimensional
however
it
is
not
actually
unpleasant
and
its
easy
to
drink
even
when
not
too
chilled
and
many
seem
to
want
it
cold
confusingly
it
still
lacks
any
character
whatsoever
d
its
always
easy
to
put
a
few
back
going
down
you
barely
feel
it
most
experienced
bas
could
probably
down
a
couple
pints
of
this
and
go
for
a
5k
run
a
halfhour
later
with
little
to
no
discomfort
drinkability
is
high
what
hey
shut
up
you
know
youll
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
in
certain
situations
dont
even
fight
it
mdkind
of
thin
for
a
stout
and
very
straightforward
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
tho
cheers
this
beer
always
finds
its
way
onto
my
list
of
good
solid
go
to
beers
cant
go
wrong
with
a
pint
of
the
black
stuff
when
at
a
good
irish
pub
also
goes
very
well
with
chocolate
desserts
d
nice
light
bodied
stout
that
consistently
shows
up
in
my
fridge
this
beer
is
definately
better
on
tap
but
from
the
can
still
not
bad
d
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
usual
on
this
particular
night
but
unfortunately
guinness
is
something
that
i
only
seem
to
settle
for
when
nothing
else
of
interest
is
available
on
tap
it
drinks
pretty
well
overall
but
there
are
just
so
many
other
good
stouts
out
there
overall
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
its
just
a
great
beer
that
is
widely
available
great
starter
beer
for
some
d
moderate
drinkability
low
abv
is
a
charm
to
manage
but
the
carbonation
is
more
filling
than
most
palette
fatigue
is
starting
to
set
in
the
sour
tones
get
a
bit
old
after
a
while
havent
had
any
other
true
irish
dry
stouts
so
this
beer
will
be
my
benchmark
for
future
reviews
of
the
style
hopefully
these
future
tastings
will
be
better
experiences
d
gets
better
as
it
warms
while
the
chocolate
comes
out
more
next
time
i
order
this
ill
just
wait
till
it
gets
to
that
point
d
probably
one
of
the
easier
to
drink
dry
stouts
its
a
good
stout
but
not
the
best
if
bartender
is
good
you
get
to
see
the
bubble
dance
and
the
creamy
head
it
is
dark
brown
alomst
balk
looking
smell
is
just
an
average
stout
nothign
popping
out
taste
lil
roasted
notes
i
taste
leaves
the
muoth
feeling
with
minal
after
taste
after
thoughts
seems
guinness
has
fallen
victim
to
the
corporate
juggernaut
this
is
good
beer
but
i
would
no
longer
say
it
is
a
great
beer
d
always
a
good
brew
d
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
though
the
cascading
effect
is
cool
but
it
doesnt
last
very
long
ill
gladly
take
extra
stout
over
this
any
day
i
must
say
i
have
an
old
feeling
for
guinness
it
is
the
first
real
beer
i
ever
had
and
i
still
love
the
taste
its
one
of
the
first
dark
beers
i
got
into
and
its
funny
i
used
to
think
it
was
a
big
beer
im
actually
impressed
now
by
how
light
and
easy
it
is
to
drink
fun
to
drink
for
the
novelty
or
on
st
patricks
day
but
there
are
numerous
other
stouts
id
take
over
this
one
i
love
the
look
of
this
pour
the
black
body
and
the
brown
castcading
head
is
a
sight
aroma
has
a
light
molassescoffee
somewhat
of
a
salty
acidic
flavor
with
a
watery
texture
and
a
dry
finish
i
see
this
beer
as
a
stand
alone
meaning
i
would
drink
a
glass
but
i
wouldnt
drink
glass
after
glass
good
beer
for
listening
to
brewing
network
live
shows
like
the
session
d
very
drinkable
you
could
stick
with
this
one
all
night
easily
drinkability
is
tremendous
now
that
it
doesnt
feel
as
thick
i
could
drink
these
forever
ill
preface
this
by
saying
that
guinness
on
tap
is
among
my
favorite
beers
however
this
review
is
of
the
nitrobottle
draught
and
it
is
sorely
lacking
the
look
is
very
close
as
well
as
the
smell
the
taste
is
almost
a
flat
watered
down
version
of
the
original
after
drinking
guinness
extensively
on
tap
im
very
comfortable
saying
that
from
the
tap
is
the
only
way
to
fly
just
not
as
good
as
the
original
original
a
classic
beer
and
the
one
that
ushered
me
into
the
world
of
beers
outside
of
marcolagers
while
this
one
no
longer
compares
to
what
i
would
call
a
world
class
beer
it
will
always
be
a
special
one
for
me
its
true
the
best
stuff
is
in
dublin
and
it
makes
sense
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
while
i
was
over
there
maybe
because
its
everywhere
but
i
can
go
for
another
and
another
another
one
of
these
and
it
sits
in
the
stomach
great
great
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
as
well
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
it
is
not
the
best
of
style
and
i
do
not
go
seeking
this
beer
out
but
it
taste
great
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
great
default
beer
at
bmc
bars
you
can
find
this
beer
almost
anywhere
d
drinkable
because
of
its
lack
of
heft
this
beer
is
much
lighter
in
body
and
flavor
than
even
5
years
ago
more
of
a
period
piece
and
nostalgic
with
the
lack
of
craftsmanship
d
mild
flavor
and
relatively
low
alcohol
make
this
one
of
the
more
easily
drinkable
stouts
can
pours
a
solid
black
with
the
beautiful
guinness
head
the
aroma
isnt
as
powerful
as
some
but
there
is
some
roasted
barley
and
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
a
very
fine
carbonation
with
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
the
feel
can
definitely
throw
people
off
if
they
have
never
had
a
beer
of
this
nature
before
i
e
mass
produced
crap
the
palate
follows
the
nose
with
notes
of
roasted
barley
a
little
coffee
and
surprisingly
light
gentle
bitterness
and
a
definite
dry
quality
this
one
is
famous
and
rightly
so
solid
not
very
complex
but
the
perfect
gateway
into
better
beer
drinking
nothing
beats
it
on
tap
in
ireland
but
this
will
have
to
do
low
in
alcohol
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
inoffensive
on
the
palate
guinness
makes
one
of
the
greater
quaffs
available
virtually
worldwide
making
it
a
perfect
fallback
and
one
of
the
pinnacles
of
session
beerdom
drinkability
its
saint
paddys
day
so
what
can
i
say
the
drinkability
is
high
and
it
has
that
distinctness
to
make
it
appealing
but
to
me
its
the
lite
version
of
stout
maybe
its
because
ive
only
had
it

the

a

you
know
i
will
when
i
have
to
go
out
and
have
a
drink
with
a
buddy
to
talk
serious
talk
and
its
going
to
take
a
while
well
we
should
be
drinking
4
beer
so
this
is
ok
enough
for
that
not
great
not
even
good
but
drinkable
in
its
context
it
has
its
iconic
appearance
pitch
black
mixed
with
its
creamcolored
head
smell
and
taste
are
slightly
bitter
and
dry
with
roasted
malt
but
it
is
not
easily
detectable
flat
mouthfeel
with
almost
no
carbonation
this
beer
somehow
has
a
reputation
as
being
strong
when
in
reality
it
is
not
any
stronger
than
the
light
pale
lagers
next
to
it
on
the
taps
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
but
not
much
more
than
an
average
beer
and
far
below
average
for
a
stout
ive
never
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
as
much
as
others
its
always
tasted
a
little
watery
to
me
when
compared
to
other
stouts
especially
guinnesss
own
extra
stout
it
looks
particularly
fantastic
from
the
can
with
the
huge
foamy
head
and
the
deep
black
color
the
pour
is
enjoyable
smells
alright
as
well
but
the
taste
still
tastes
watery
and
lacks
the
thick
creamy
feel
that
i
look
for
in
a
good
stout
drinkability
wow
this
beer
surprised
me
i
wasnt
too
big
on
the
extra
stout
guess
it
isnt
my
style
and
was
expecting
not
to
like
this
too
much
however
this
ended
up
being
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
absolutely
great
and
i
cannot
understand
all
the
haters
for
the
life
of
me
bought
a
nitrocan
guinness
and
a
nitrocan
beamish
and
did
a
taste
test
both
poured
from
the
cans
with
the
usual
hiss
of
the
nitro
pellet
in
a
nice
foamy
stream
both
looked
about
the
same
in
the
glass
once
settled
with
a
massive
rich
foamy
head
on
top
the
beamish
a
bit
more
tan
and
the
guinness
more
gray
and
a
deep
brown
to
black
with
ruby
highlights
below
little
carbonation
visible
smell
was
similar
just
a
touch
of
smoky
malts
initial
tastes
were
quite
different
beamish
was
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
well
balanced
drinkable
mix
of
malt
flavors
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
made
it
very
easy
to
drinktop
to
bottom
the
guinness
was
similar
but
with
a
bit
more
hops
bitterness
that
soon
turned
to
a
metallic
hint
of
alcohol
as
it
warmed
definitely
enjoyed
both
of
them
who
wouldnt
but
the
beamish
was
a
tad
bit
better
imho
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
drinking
guinness
an
old
standby
that
i
grabbed
for
the
holidays
easy
drinking
and
well
rounded
looks
great
in
the
glass
with
the
tan
bubbles
slowly
subsiding
yielding
the
jet
black
brew
and
the
fluffy
airy
head
holding
it
delicate
stucture
seemingly
forever
the
yinyang
of
the
fluffy
head
and
the
rich
brew
on
the
tongue
unfortunately
i
find
the
taste
less
overwhelming
a
standard
straightforward
flavor
of
strongly
roasted
nearly
burnt
malt
with
a
bitter
chocolate
bitterness
d
the
smooth
taste
and
low
abv
means
you
can
easily
down
several
pints
though
among
the
big
3
i
prefer
beamish
you
cant
go
wrong
with
guiness
sure
its
not
the
most
complex
or
flavorful
stout
but
its
readily
available
reliable
and
highly
drinkable
a
pretty
good
beer
in
terms
of
how
widely
available
it
is
but
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
pours
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
i
would
like
a
bit
more
carbonation
the
prominent
taste
is
that
of
bitter
coffee
however
it
is
not
overpowering
even
though
i
do
not
particularly
like
the
taste
it
is
a
smooth
beer
and
one
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
did
not
particularly
like
this
it
poured
a
dark
cloudy
color
with
a
off
white
head
had
a
weird
mouth
feel
to
me
and
a
pretty
bitter
aftertaste
there
was
just
something
off
with
this
for
me
not
one
that
i
would
rush
off
to
buy
again
the
stout
is
much
better
than
this
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
body
with
a
big
slightly
offwhite
head
not
much
aroma
taste
has
some
malts
a
thick
roasted
flavor
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
too
complex
a
flavor
profile
guinness
is
my
favourite
beer
available
in
most
pubs
and
always
a
good
stout
quite
filling
and
apparently
can
be
good
for
you
being
fairly
high
in
iron
and
everything
if
theres
nothing
else
worth
having
there
is
always
a
good
guinness
good
stout
this
one
overall
well
this
isnt
the
best
stout
out
there
certainly
but
it
has
a
nice
appearance
and
it
has
some
distinct
flavors
and
somekind
of
character
that
i
like
served
cold
it
is
a
fine
beer
d
very
high
drinkability
with
this
one
its
a
nice
smooth
beer
with
not
a
very
strong
flavor
and
goes
down
nice
would
be
a
decent
introduction
to
those
unfamiliar
with
dark
more
strongly
flavored
beers
d
you
can
drink
a
fair
amount
of
this
beer
its
abv
is
lower
than
average
and
while
somewhat
boring
still
drinkable
a
decent
session
brew
d
drinks
like
a
champ
not
a
big
fan
of
the
beer
or
the
style
but
it
does
have
its
place
guinness
is
generally
my
go
to
at
macro
bars
when
its
winter
and
there
are
no
other
options
i
wouldnt
say
i
dislike
the
beer
though
i
dont
love
it
as
you
always
know
what
youre
getting
its
smooth
light
and
at
least
brings
some
flavor
to
the
table
drinkability
is
super
due
to
the
low
carbonation
and
low
abv
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
want
a
break
from
hop
bombs
or
high
abv
beer
this
is
a
difficult
beer
for
me
to
rate
as
it
was
my
gateway
beer
and
i
will
always
have
a
special
place
for
it
despite
my
introduction
to
craft
beer
a
cold
guinness
straight
from
the
tap
is
still
one
of
the
most
satisfying
beerdrinking
experiences
i
can
think
of
however
i
will
try
as
always
to
rate
the
beer
based
on
how
the
beer
represents
the
style
and
what
the
brewer
intended
the
beer
to
taste
like
and
to
a
weighted
degree
my
personal
preference
not
just
any
one
of
the
aforementioned
aspects
end
disclaimer
can
pours
a
dark
body
with
about
a
one
inch
thick
head
not
a
lot
of
aroma
some
sweet
malts
and
thats
about
it
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
either
some
malts
and
a
tad
bit
of
caramel
if
you
really
dig
medium
body
light
but
full
mouth
feel
the
most
refreshing
beer
out
there
althought
i
didnt
like
it
enough
to
order
another
i
can
definately
see
how
you
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
stuff
its
smoothness
coupled
with
its
easy
taste
could
make
for
a
looong
night
or
morning
depending
on
your
tastes
i
have
drank
this
many
many
times
the
bottle
is
not
the
way
to
go
they
tell
you
to
drink
straight
from
the
bottle
which
is
stupid
off
tap
or
from
can
to
glass
is
one
thing
but
this
is
a
flat
lackluster
guinness
at
its
best
i
do
not
recomend
this
from
the
bottle
well
ill
drink
it
but
i
may
not
be
totally
excited
about
it
i
would
fly
to
ireland
just
to
taste
it
freshly
poured
from
a
local
pub
drinkability
is
moderate
its
easy
to
consume
but
its
really
not
that
great
it
lacks
depth
of
flavor
and
important
aspects
of
body
its
certainly
sessionable
but
id
be
too
bored
to
drink
more
than
one
i
always
remembered
liking
guinness
and
wondered
why
everyone
slammed
the
nitro
bottle
so
much
and
now
i
think
ive
figured
out
why
d
very
drinkable
and
easy
going
down
full
of
flavor
but
no
too
strong
i
can
definetley
put
quite
a
few
of
these
down
in
a
sitting
loved
the
appearance
when
it
was
freshly
poured
from
the
tap
it
had
the
waterfall
effect
in
the
beer
which
is
totally
impressive
with
the
little
bubbles
that
trickle
down
from
the
top
some
are
drawn
back
by
the
dark
black
motor
oil
look
with
the
thick
creamy
head
but
not
me
i
love
irish
dry
stouts
theyre
my
favorite
smells
of
heavy
roast
and
that
is
exactly
what
you
first
taste
as
it
hits
your
tongue
however
you
do
get
a
slight
tin
flavor
which
is
slightly
odd
full
thick
head
stays
with
the
glass
all
the
way
down
mmmm
barkeep
pour
me
another
d
a
great
session
beer
sure
there
are
stouts
with
more
flavors
but
guinness
is
widely
available
and
its
mild
mannered
flavor
makes
it
easy
to
drink
as
many
as
youd
like
one
night
i
had
8
imperial
pints
in
a
row
without
getting
as
full
as
i
would
have
with
other
beers
alcohol
level
is
low
so
it
keeps
you
standing
and
guinness
is
calorically
low
which
never
hurts
and
makes
it
a
good
option
instead
of
a
typical
light
beer
i
could
drink
this
from
10
am
on
and
all
day
on
a
rainy
day
and
often
have
the
only
killer
is
how
many
bars
screw
this
beer
up
d
very
drinkable
didnt
find
it
filling
or
overbearing
this
might
have
use
as
a
stepping
stone
for
getting
someone
to
come
over
from
bmc
products
into
craft
beers
other
than
that
i
think
its
a
waste
personally
this
beer
is
just
really
fun
to
look
at
the
taste
is
almost
like
chocolate
milk
to
me
for
some
reason
really
smooth
and
creamy
im
not
particularly
impressed
with
it
in
any
way
besides
the
appearance
the
flavor
should
be
bolder
and
more
full
for
the
way
it
looks
and
the
dark
color
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
though
ill
prolly
have
a
a
craving
later
for
another
cheers
i
love
guinness
but
there
are
better
options
very
dark
and
chocolatley
stout
and
goes
great
with
hearty
stews
and
works
well
for
cooking
guinness
in
america
is
good
but
try
it
in
the
uk
its
a
dream
im
going
to
rate
it
as
i
normally
drink
here
in
the
us
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
guinness
is
the
slight
negative
aftertaste
which
i
didnt
taste
when
i
was
traveling
overseas
poured
from
a
nitro
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
cascading
effect
through
a
dark
brown
body
nice
creamy
head
some
lacing
is
there
aroma
of
burnt
coffee
grinds
and
hints
of
chocolate
taste
is
on
par
with
the
nose
roasted
coffee
dry
bakers
chocolate
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
what
gets
to
me
on
this
one
its
thin
and
watery
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
i
prefer
the
extra
stout
to
the
draught
personally
but
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
on
nitrotap
maybe
i
should
have
drank
this
from
the
bottle
as
it
insisted
after
a
few
minutes
the
beer
became
flat
and
watery
which
took
away
from
the
overall
taste
not
very
pleasing
very
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
tap
guinness
in
ireland
but
i
have
to
settle
just
like
the
rest
of
america
to
me
the
only
thing
more
satisfying
than
watching
a
guinness
settle
is
consuming
it
the
smooth
taste
is
comforting
while
i
would
say
there
are
other
beers
out
there
that
are
more
worthy
of
the
brilliant
accolade
guinness
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
overall
this
beer
is
definately
drinkable
its
low
abv
means
you
can
drink
it
all
night
and
that
nothing
is
overpowering
means
youll
never
get
sick
of
it
definatley
sessionable
and
ive
sessioned
it
many
times
tastes
and
feels
nice
is
a
pleasure
to
look
at
and
goes
down
very
nicely
on
the
other
hand
i
could
see
how
some
might
find
it
too
dull
and
weak
after
a
few
pints
and
want
to
move
on
to
something
else
in
the
end
though
i
find
it
to
be
a
great
session
brew
off
the
tap
drinkability
its
guinness
how
could
you
hate
it
i
certainly
dont
but
i
cant
say
its
as
good
as
i
once
believed
it
is
better
than
a
macrolager
and
since
its
ubiquitous
even
a
bad
beer
bar
will
have
this
and
probably
give
you
a
glass
if
you
order
one
im
glad
its
around
but
i
personally
dont
drink
guinness
much
anymore
definitely
get
guinness
if
its
between
guinness
and
a
watery
american
macrobrew
if
its
between
guinness
and
another
stout
go
for
the
other
stout
unfortunately
the
former
choice
is
the
one
you
will
have
at
many
us
bars
two
tastes
weak
coffee
and
bitter
beer
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
is
the
motto
however
the
best
we
can
say
is
its
coffee
appearance
and
huge
creamy
head
that
stays
there
ok
to
drink
if
youre
drinking
something
after
to
take
away
the
taste
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
back
with
on
a
hot
evening
and
enjoy
i
like
to
milk
these
in
order
to
enjoy
the
changing
characteristics
as
it
warms
not
as
strong
as
the
stout
and
goes
well
with
an
irish
car
bomb
yes
i
know
its
a
mixed
drink
but
its
what
got
me
to
try
guinness
the
first
time
overall
a
pretty
decent
stout
not
the
best
out
there
though
certainly
dont
mind
having
one
of
these
every
now
and
then
poured
from
the
pintsized
can
poured
the
usual
but
wonderful
cascading
tan
head
until
it
was
dark
brown
with
a
solid
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
the
longhaul
smell
is
chocolatety
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
a
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
aroma
even
before
swallowing
it
finishes
with
a
solid
aftertaste
of
the
same
and
is
very
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
didnt
findi
it
filling
or
overbearing
just
nothing
real
special
tastewise
this
wasnt
all
that
great
a
bit
of
a
malted
chocolate
flavor
in
there
the
color
was
rich
black
similar
to
soda
with
with
a
tan
head
smell
is
sort
of
smokey
metallic
mouthfeel
was
sort
of
thick
it
wasnt
the
most
drinkable
beer
on
the
planet
but
was
better
then
most
of
the
stuff
at
the
party
today
d
the
lack
of
richness
in
this
brew
would
make
it
very
easy
to
session
dgood
easy
to
drink
a
classic
ive
been
drinking
for
years
that
im
somewhat
partial
to
due
to
experience
but
now
that
ive
expanded
out
a
little
its
merely
ok
d
smooth
and
easy
alright
ive
taken
a
complete
360
when
it
comes
to
guinness
in
general
what
can
i
say
its
not
bad
pours
a
black
color
thick
tan
head
and
an
overall
visually
appealing
beer
this
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
mild
coffee
flavor
with
hints
of
malt
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
but
this
is
the
easy
drinking
easy
obtainable
stout
and
ive
got
no
problem
with
that
an
awesome
cascading
effect
when
poured
where
the
colors
sift
back
and
forth
before
settling
a
nice
milklooking
head
sits
on
top
of
the
living
brew
but
looks
only
go
so
far
no
aroma
whatsoever
is
backed
by
no
real
taste
whatsoever
slight
cream
make
you
feel
like
you
are
drinking
a
light
flavorless
milkshake
a
true
disappointment
makes
one
hell
of
an
irish
car
bomb
too
which
adds
for
drinkability
too
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
that
makes
you
want
to
chug
the
thing
everything
considered
while
this
is
far
from
perfect
it
is
a
good
solid
beer
when
in
the
mood
for
something
dark
and
bitter
i
do
remember
getting
this
on
tap
at
mccormicks
irish
pub
back
in
richmond
va
about
6
or
7
years
ago
and
i
think
i
remember
it
being
better
than
this
oh
it
was
so
good
d
ive
had
this
from
a
can
and
bottle
but
it
is
always
best
on
tap
it
is
the
choice
at
restaurants
than
just
feature
bmc
i
wouldnt
drink
more
that
one
in
a
row
but
i
would
gladly
have
one
in
the
morning
or
for
dessert
anything
that
gets
my
wife
involved
and
approving
of
my
beer
hobby
is
fine
with
me
she
likes
this
one
a
lot
often
joked
about
but
very
true
guinness
is
a
very
thick
and
heavy
beer
there
are
considerably
heavier
stouts
from
other
microbreweries
but
guinness
is
up
there
low
abv
but
i
cant
imagine
having
more
than
two
of
these
in
one
drinking
session
overall
not
to
bad
for
something
that
is
a
beer
that
people
talk
about
all
the
time
or
at
least
what
my
college
buddies
say
to
be
one
of
the
biggest
beers
of
all
time
decent
drinkability
if
its
your
thing
this
beer
is
almost
black
and
you
get
like
atleast
an
inch
head
on
it
which
tastes
delicious
the
only
bad
thing
about
the
nitro
canbottle
is
as
soon
as
you
open
it
it
starts
to
spill
so
you
gotta
be
quick
about
pouring
it
this
beer
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
it
looks
so
dont
let
it
scare
you
it
kind
of
tastes
like
coffee
d
all
day
everyday
and
for
2
50
a
piece
happy
hour
you
can
get
alot
done
easily
available
most
recognizable
but
definitely
overpriced
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
to
look
at
with
a
dark
soft
color
and
fluffy
head
this
beer
is
beautiful
not
much
aroma
is
given
off
my
nose
cant
pick
up
much
of
anything
mouthfeel
is
real
good
with
a
texture
that
is
silky
soft
and
smooth
finishes
with
ease
the
flavor
is
where
i
am
most
disappointed
overall
the
taste
is
good
but
i
want
more
flavors
in
a
stout
i
dont
want
to
say
guinness
is
bland
but
in
a
sense
it
really
is
overall
it
is
a
decent
stout
certainly
it
has
been
marketed
and
changed
to
appeal
to
the
more
common
beer
drinker
but
at
its
core
it
is
still
a
stout
there
are
many
better
examples
out
there
but
i
suppose
it
still
has
a
place
in
my
and
my
other
peoples
hearts
as
the
classic
stout
it
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
good
ales
so
i
have
to
thank
it
for
that
ill
probably
end
up
keeping
a
few
around
the
house
just
to
have
for
an
easy
drinker
this
is
what
most
people
think
of
when
they
think
stout
its
not
the
greatest
one
ive
ever
had
especially
from
within
guinness
itself
there
are
much
better
varieties
of
just
this
type
and
stouts
in
general
however
its
not
that
bad
either
i
guess
i
would
just
consider
this
one
to
be
average
the
draught
thats
actually
on
nitro
tap
is
better
than
the
draught
thats
sold
in
the
bottle
neither
of
them
are
nearly
as
good
as
the
guinness
extra
stout
and
even
thats
not
the
absolute
best
that
ive
ever
had
though
its
considerably
better
than
this
one
poured
a
deep
deep
brown
that
was
somewhat
sluggish
and
slow
to
pour
small
tannish
head
nose
was
burnt
barley
and
coffee
taste
was
roasty
espresso
and
smooth
but
thin
the
carbonation
is
ok
but
the
body
is
far
too
watery
for
a
stout
not
nearly
as
good
as
tap
www
theviceblog
com
overall
its
good
but
not
great
guinness
draught
is
the
joke
of
all
stouts
its
appearance
is
its
only
saving
grace
as
it
is
quite
dark
and
leaves
a
goodsized
longlasting
head
which
also
leaves
some
good
lacing
once
you
get
past
that
theres
not
much
good
to
be
said
smells
like
a
watereddown
stout
and
it
tastes
like
one
too
honestly
where
is
the
taste
in
this
especially
when
compared
with
its
extra
stout
brother
this
one
is
just
weak
for
me
its
even
hard
to
finish
one
just
because
its
so
watereddown
dear
guinness
please
make
extra
stout
your
standard
style
this
is
the
best
looking
beer
ever
imo
the
creamy
bone
white
head
on
top
of
the
black
body
is
quite
a
sight
aside
from
a
great
creamy
texture
this
is
just
an
average
offering
mild
roasty
smells
and
flavors
little
else
certainly
drinkable
given
how
light
it
is
but
why
bother
drinkability
this
is
an
entry
level
stout
not
bad
but
certainly
not
as
fullbodied
as
one
would
hope
from
the
most
famous
of
all
stouts
at
4
1
abv
it
makes
a
great
session
beer
and
at
125
calories
per
12oz
it
isnt
filling
personally
ill
stay
with
imperial
stouts
if
i
have
a
choice
if
not
guinness
is
a
good
standby
even
if
i
do
have
problems
with
their
unethical
business
practices
and
treatment
of
the
irish
people
a
pleasant
enough
beer
i
like
the
extra
stout
bottle
much
better
extremely
dark
nearblack
color
with
absurdly
strong
creamy
head
and
lacing
it
just
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
rather
weak
flavor
is
decent
some
malt
and
coffee
with
a
more
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
full
and
creamy
very
smooth
but
unexciting
i
prefer
the
extra
stout
which
has
more
carbonation
overall
a
good
thick
and
solid
beer
but
not
spectacular
a
stout
for
nonstout
drinkers
sad
as
it
is
not
like
the
stuff
you
get
in
dublin
these
are
very
easy
drinking
as
they
lack
much
character
at
all
and
if
you
are
unfortunate
to
have
one
poured
where
the
head
is
nonexistent
you
miss
the
most
pleasing
dominant
flavors
wow
am
i
giving
a
thumbs
down
to
a
legend
not
really
id
still
drink
this
over
bud
any
day
but
this
represents
a
sad
example
of
the
true
nature
of
the
original
if
you
cut
my
arms
i
do
not
bleed
blood
but
guinness
this
is
a
black
beer
that
has
the
cool
reverse
bubbles
flowing
up
from
the
bottom
the
smell
is
mild
the
taste
is
slightly
sour
with
smooth
malt
notes
and
a
good
balance
of
hops
the
mouth
feel
from
the
nitro
is
very
nice
it
is
a
full
but
light
mouth
feel
the
drinkability
is
surprising
easy
youll
put
away
three
before
you
know
it
d
i
dont
drink
this
much
at
home
anymore
from
the
cans
but
it
is
an
easy
to
go
beer
in
almost
any
beer
or
restaurant
this
was
black
as
midnight
and
somth
as
silk
form
the
first
sip
i
was
hooked
a
nice
dark
roast
coffie
start
and
smooth
finish
this
was
less
bitter
than
the
extra
stout
vershion
i
love
this
one
this
is
a
bit
thicker
than
your
starter
beers
but
i
love
it
also
try
this
one
in
a
black
and
tan
every
sip
is
a
difrent
flavor
overall
certainly
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
could
put
back
a
few
but
really
wouldnt
want
to
could
get
something
much
better
drinkability
i
dont
know
if
id
come
running
back
to
this
especially
if
there
are
other
irish
stouts
available
but
given
the
selection
at
the
place
that
i
got
this
it
was
probably
the
best
i
was
going
to
do
anyway
all
in
all
id
say
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
remarkable
d
easy
to
get
down
due
to
mouthfeel
but
the
flavor
isnt
something
i
want
to
experience
for
hours
on
end
furthermore
this
brew
is
an
overhyped
representation
of
the
style
and
is
somewhat
bland
spreadn
cheer
this
guinness
was
great
the
brew
was
completely
black
with
a
fingerlength
white
head
the
composition
between
the
two
was
perfect
it
was
so
even
and
exact
that
it
looked
fake
i
couldnt
stop
staring
the
beer
had
a
roasted
dry
taste
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
guinness
the
head
lasted
all
the
way
to
the
last
sip
and
provided
the
perfect
creaminess
to
balance
the
dryness
i
enjoyed
this
one
profusely
and
will
continue
to
drink
it
only
from
the
tap
d
its
easy
to
drink
but
more
flavor
would
really
help
this
along
i
just
dont
see
what
all
the
craze
for
guinness
is
about
very
enjoyable
beer
not
the
taste
and
experience
of
a
belgian
but
i
feel
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
well
looks
like
ill
be
in
the
minority
here
my
first
mistake
was
getting
this
from
a
can
poured
a
nice
dark
earthy
brown
with
good
head
smelled
a
little
roasted
then
i
tasted
it
and
it
was
awful
it
had
the
taste
of
burned
up
dirty
rags
the
group
i
was
with
was
sipping
away
but
i
couldnt
even
finish
mine
then
i
heard
that
the
closer
one
gets
to
where
guinness
is
brewed
the
better
it
tastes
like
melted
butter
well
nc
is
a
far
cry
from
ireland
so
i
dont
plan
on
choosing
this
again
until
i
get
to
the
land
o
the
irish
there
are
plenty
of
better
stouts
here
for
me
to
enjoy
sorry
but
i
was
sorely
dissappointed
d
there
are
a
lot
of
stouts
that
taste
better
out
of
the
can
than
this
one
drinkability
is
very
high
i
can
quaff
many
a
can
before
succumbing
to
sleep
not
the
best
irish
dry
ever
but
something
that
every
beer
drinker
needs
to
drink
at
least
once
drinkability
always
very
good
choice
at
any
time
ill
have
guinness
again
im
sure
but
its
not
the
same
as
when
i
first
started
drinking
it
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
thats
like
shaving
cream
lacing
is
a
continuous
sheet
down
the
glass
weak
aromas
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
taste
same
very
weak
and
watery
with
low
carbonation
very
disappointing
i
do
like
guinness
but
i
will
not
buy
the
guinness
draught
again
md
creamy
mouthfull
drink
it
all
night
long
everyone
knows
guinness
and
that
is
for
good
reason
i
have
to
say
this
beer
is
the
best
light
beer
ive
ever
had
at
125
calories
for
a
12
oz
serving
it
is
a
hard
one
to
beat
it
is
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
to
top
off
any
night
out
drinking
it
is
full
of
flavor
it
has
a
very
dark
black
color
and
it
has
a
creamy
head
that
cascades
as
it
settles
from
the
pour
if
you
have
not
had
a
guinness
draught
then
get
out
of
that
cave
you
are
living
in
and
go
get
one
you
may
or
may
not
care
for
it
but
i
feel
the
majority
of
people
that
try
one
would
have
it
again
i
consider
it
the
gateway
beer
for
more
exciting
beer
drinking
although
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
i
rank
it
very
highly
for
a
very
drinkable
stout
personally
for
its
style
i
would
prefer
a
murphys
but
they
are
harder
to
find
d
drinkability
is
average
the
beer
goes
down
easy
and
remains
smooth
throughout
however
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
bland
i
would
only
get
this
if
nothing
better
were
available
at
the
time
this
is
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
it
certainly
is
the
most
overrated
if
you
disagree
with
me
then
you
are
insane
i
am
not
trying
to
troll
but
the
fact
that
i
am
relatively
new
to
the
world
of
fine
beers
and
this
one
was
easy
to
point
out
as
terrible
and
tasteless
i
should
be
allowed
to
make
such
a
caustic
statement
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
15
2008
at
mccabes
irish
pub
in
guelph
ontario
canada
the
beer
was
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
coloured
head
that
lasted
a
long
time
the
aroma
was
almost
nonexistent
the
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
but
very
little
carbonation
the
flavour
was
very
reminiscent
of
diluted
tea
i
know
it
says
drink
from
the
bottle
but
i
had
to
pour
into
a
glass
poured
a
very
deep
dark
ruby
color
with
the
typical
cascading
nitro
bubbles
thin
creamy
brown
head
that
seems
to
last
forever
smell
is
likewise
very
creamy
some
malty
sweetness
taste
is
slightly
peaty
roasted
malt
very
light
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
dry
as
to
be
expected
i
much
prefer
the
extra
stout
nitrocan

finally

everyone
says

tastes
like

they
automatically
assume
its
my
beer
of
choice
its
a
decent
beer

in
making
it

just
dont
know
who
would
want
to
ill
be
honest
im
having
trouble
finding
the
redeemable
qualities
in
this
one
i
guess
ill
just
say
that
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
i
cant
help
but
feel
like
this
selection
somewhat
tarnishes
the
illustrious
guinness
name
i
realize
its
produced
to
be
a
widely
appealing
macro
brew
but
im
just
not
digging
it

but
did
end
up
with
close
to
a
full
serving
the
beige
head
held
on
through
the
drink
more
or
less
ok
but
doesnt
fit
the
appearance
mouthfeel
i
love
the
shake
like
feel
of
guinness
if
sam
adams
cream
stout
had
a
mouthfeel
like
this
id
drink
nothing
else
takes
me
a
while
to
drink
guinness
because
i
like
to
swirl
every
swig
around
for
a
while
drinkability
is
solid
for
me
due
to
mouthfeel
and
low
alcohol
content

which
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
american
lagers
that
i
need
not
mention
though
true
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
but
its
a
freakin
classic
best
of
all
it
has
an
availability
rivaled
only
by
bmc
by
far
my
favorite
beer
i
truly
enjoy
the
rich
coffee
flavor
from
the
roasted
barley
a
wonderful
carmel
flavour
from
the
creamy
head
the
great
bitters
finish
on
occasion
i
have
had
it
poured
in
the
wrong
glass
i
found
out
that
there
are
two
styles
of
guinness
glasses
available
and
it
does
ruin
the
beer
virtually
no
aftertaste
and
with
the
low
alcohol
content
combines
to
make
a
pretty
darn
good
session
beer
drinkability
i
love
stouts
people
think
im
crazy
when
i
tell
them
that
i
think
its
somewhat
thin
tasting
because
lots
of
people
think
its
like
a
meal
in
a
bottle
but
i
dont
buy
that
i
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
of
this
and
guinness
extra
stout
but
i
think
that
the
extra
stout
is
more
up
my
alley
also
i
really
wish
guinness
used
true
16
ounce
cans
and
12
ounce
bottles
this
14
9
ounce11
2
ounce
business
is
just
lame
come
on
we
all
know
guinness
its
the
other
gateway
beer
next
to
sierra
its
good
for
what
it
is
trying
to
do
not
a
special
stout
by
any
means
but
come
on
its
guinness
ok
i
was
a
little
annoyed
after
reading
the
bros
s
reviews
of
this
brew
as
they
seemed
harsh
just
for
the
sake
of
oh
if
you
had
it
in
dublin
or
it
used
to
be
better
and
the
like
however
its
true
this
has
been
dumbed
down
a
good
deal
from
what
i
remember
cutting
my
beer
teeth
on
from
the
tap
not
worth
a
purchase
especially
with
so
many
more
american
craft
breweries
attempting
the
dry
irish
style
3fs
black
sun
anyone
the
version
of
guinness
we
get
here
is
definitely
light
on
the
smell
and
taste
only
a
hint
of
roasted
barley
flavor
is
apparent
however
the
appearance
with
jet
black
body
and
thick
head
and
the
creamy
milkshake
taste
are
what
makes
this
beer
so
enjoyable
for
me
combined
with
the
relatively
low
alcohol
content
this
is
a
very
chuggable
session
beer
that
i
can
always
depend
on
when
im
somewhere
that
doesnt
serve
craft
beer
anyway
if
kept
well
the
pour
is
the
classic
we
have
all
come
to
know
and
love
the
smell
is
limited
to
a
mild
roasted
flavour
all
i
can
say
about
the
taste
is
that
it
is
distinctively
that
of
guinness
except
when
the
quality
of
servingkeeping
is
lower
and
bitterness
starts
to
overwhelm
a
good
draught
guinness
should
be
smooth
nicely
flavoured
and
not
bitter
and
dead
easy
to
drink
theres
nothing
better
the
watching
the
creamy
head
foam
on
a
guinness
smell
has
roasted
malty
aromas
could
be
a
little
stronger
though
goes
down
extremely
smooth
with
light
carbonation
and
much
more
bitterness
than
i
remember
the
malts
and
hops
are
very
well
balanced
this
is
one
great
beer
and
shouldnt
be
put
down
just
because
its
one
the
big
boys
the
bottle
says
this
is
supposed
to
be
consumed
directly
from
the
bottle
so
i
did
that
i
only
poured
a
bit
into
a
glass
to
evaluate
the
appearance
it
is
nice
and
dark
but
not
black
light
does
penetrate
and
it
is
more
of
a
dark
brown
body
the
aroma
isnt
strong
at
all
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
is
pretty
much
it
the
taste
is
decent
but
could
use
a
bit
more
punch
to
it
there
is
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
again
and
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
but
it
is
pretty
thin
the
body
is
as
thin
as
the
taste
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
think
of
this
as
heavy
bodied
this
is
however
one
of
the
most
quaffable
darker
beers
out
there
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
that
havent
had
one
of
these
in
a
good
while
ordered
this
from
a
nitrotap
very
interesting
show
before
all
was
said
and
done
with
foam
rising
to
the
top
from
the
bottom
eventually
it
became
a
dark
black
with
a
finger
thick
head
that
was
the
color
of
the
inside
of
a
whopper
the
candy
not
the
burger
decent
lacing
however
the
line
where
the
drink
itself
and
the
head
meet
looked
synthetically
straight
kind
of
took
a
lot
of
the
soul
out
for
me
smell
is
kind
of
weak
but
rather
sweetsmelling
taste
is
rather
weak
especially
for
something
labeled
as
a
stout
mildly
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
but
closer
to
the
consistency
of
water
easily
sessionable
but
i
would
rather
move
on
to
bigger
and
better
things
sadly
this
is
often
the
best
thing
available
at
many
locations
was
actually
my
first
time
that
ive
ever
had
this
worldrenowned
popular
brew
sampled
it
on
draft
at
legal
sea
foods
in
short
hills
and
to
be
honest
i
cant
understand
what
all
the
hype
is
behind
this
one
although
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
the
dualcolor
dark
tan
appearance
it
basically
went
downhill
from
there
a
basically
average
dry
stout
smell
that
wasnt
too
appealing
led
to
a
bitter
and
uninviting
taste
that
had
an
even
more
astringent
aftertaste
oily
slick
mouthfeel
and
too
bitter
to
be
a
drinkable
brew
in
my
opinion
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
ever
again
it
can
compare
to
the
real
draught
version
but
what
beer
does
and
given
that
its
widely
available
its
a
heckuva
a
lot
better
option
than
heineken
or
arguably
sam
adams
solid
beer
not
exceptional
but
worth
buying
every
now
and
then
but
if
youre
a
nonconformist
conformist
and
dont
drink
it
because
its
popular
its
only
your
loss
d
very
easy
to
drink
in
my
early
days
of
drinking
i
always
felt
guinness
was
so
overpoweringly
bitter
after
tasting
a
variety
of
stouts
now
its
amazingly
bland
fantastically
easy
to
drink
and
aesthetically
a
masterpiece
but
a
real
lightweight
in
flavour
now
for
me
14
9
oz
widget
can
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
the
cascade
effect
is
great
and
the
lasting
tan
head
is
inviting
smell
of
rich
roasted
coffee
maltiness
maybe
almost
chocolately
taste
is
roasty
some
bitterness
with
not
too
long
a
finish
but
i
was
surprised
by
how
watery
and
thin
i
found
this
beer
despite
it
being
so
dark
and
a
stout
for
some
reason
i
remember
it
having
more
body
i
found
it
less
filling
and
full
flavored
than
i
was
expecting
decent
but
not
good
d
there
are
plenty
of
local
irish
stouts
and
beamish
that
i
prefer
but
an
easy
drinker
that
is
without
a
doubt
sesionable
i
had
a
perfectly
poured
guinness
on
tap
last
week
complete
with
shamrock
they
havent
been
able
to
can
that
yet
drink
this
on
tap
or
poured
out
of
the
ordinary
bottle
forget
anything
with
widgets
overall
this
just
seems
watered
down
for
some
reason
decent
enough
with
food
or
in
a
pub
with
some
friends
but
theres
not
much
going
here
except
for
a
nostalgia
thing
i
like
this
beer
better
on
tap
in
my
opinion
still
one
of
my
favorites
to
drink
though
if
the
extra
stout
i
bought
is
anything
like
this
i
will
be
severely
disappointed
overall
its
pretty
much
the
same
as
guinness
draught
in
the
can
only
its
in
a
bottle
and
you
dont
get
as
much
if
youre
just
breaking
into
the
craft
brew
scene
its
a
good
beer
to
use
to
get
your
feet
wet
once
you
do
though
keep
in
mind
there
are
other
stouts
out
there
that
are
much
better
the
place
advertised
a
perfect
pour
and
i
have
to
agree
with
them
a
finger
and
a
half
of
pearly
head
that
left
tight
knit
lacing
all
the
way
to
the
end
pitch
black

lots
of

ill
give
it

will
only
drink
this
beer
in

this
is
a
beer
that
you
dont
just
pour
straight
into

it
to

this
happened
to

in

i
was

the

of
a
guinness
is
an
absolute

you
will
notice
the
color

its
poured
from

and
how
it
forms
a

its

goot
ole
risky
whiskey
gotta
try
the
combo
drinkability
many
times
this
is
the
only
non
light
beer
available
in
bars
so
i
find
myself
with
this
in
my
hand
a
decent
amount
for
me
it
is
better
than
bud
light
if
thats
a
compliment
what
more
can
be
said
about
guinness
this
clearly
isnt
as
good
as
what
you
will
find
on
tap
at
a
bar
that
has
fresh
guinness
that
knows
how
to
pour
it
the
right
experience
on
tap
can
be
exhilirating
i
still
want
to
go
to
the
guinness
plant
and
have
it
at
peak
freshness
in
order
to
compare
it
to
the
best
of
what
we
get
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
having
said
all
that
the
nitro
can
is
decent
creamy
and
a
reasonable
take
home
alternative
the
smell
is
a
little
tinny
but
good
and
malty
the
taste
is
water
roasted
barley
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
tin
the
lacing
is
excellent
if
you
want
to
call
it
lacing
in
that
it
billows
on
the
sides
of
your
glass
there
is
no
sweetness
in
this
beer
very
dry
all
malt
no
bitterness
lots
of
water
it
isnt
a
strong
beer
by
any
standards
and
the
alcohol
taste
is
completely
absent
the
cream
is
good
right
out
from
the
pour
but
it
does
dissipate
a
bit
towards
the
end
of
the
pint
glass
i
like
guinness
always
have
and
it
works
in
the
right
setting
complementing
the
right
food
its
better
on
tap
and
im
sure
better
across
the
atlantic
but
if
you
crave
a
dry
malty
irish
stout
this
is
where
you
have
to
begin
you
dont
have
to
end
here
since
beamish
or
murphys
is
probably
a
better
next
stop
lchaim
um
whats
all
the
fuss
there
is
very
little
redeeming
in
this
brew
nice
black
appearance
with
that
cool
guinness
head
nice
cascading
effect
in
the
pour
there
is
almost
no
smell
beyond
a
slight
grain
aroma
no
roast
like
the
extra
stout
in
the
same
way
that
budweiser
tastes
watereddown
but
sort
of
filling
i
wish
i
could
drink
more

which
became
assertive
towards
the
finish
the
roasted
flavors
are
very
faded
for
a
stout
with
little
else
coming
in
to
bail
it
out

interesting
thing
is
that
having
it
from

eliminates
the
effect
that
a

lines
can
have
on
the

i
definitely
have
to
wonder
if
i
havent
been
to
a

bars
that
were
a

lax

not
a

to

full

5this
beer
goes
down
like
a
champ
which
isnt
designed
to
be
poured
into
a
glass
not
a
real
enjoyable
beer
maybe
the
first
but
not
the
king
of
stouts
imho
d
why
not
drink
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
meal
but
isnt
heavy
on
calories
i
had
this
at
a
local
restaurant
on
a
nitrotap
it
was
served
much
too
cold
but
looked
delicious
with
a
tan
appearance
that
settled
as
into
a
uniform
darkbrown
color
the
too
cold
temperature
i
think
helped
deaden
an
already
faint
aroma
to
the
extent
that
i
couldnt
smell
a
thing
taste
was
much
more
subtle
than
i
remember
with
a
good
but
faint
caramel
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
a
bit
thin
and
watery
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
felt
like
i
could
drink
guinness
all
night
nitro
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
appearance
is
dark
black
with
light
reddish
tinges
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
foamy
cappucino
colored
head
with
strong
lacing
smell
is
coffee
chocolate
underlying
hops
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
very
little
alcohol
taste
and
the
slight
hop
flavor
bringing
the
taste
of
coffee
out
even
more
with
hints
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
very
nice
drinkability
is
wonderful
i
could
go
on
this
one
all
night
ill
definitely
be
keeping
this
one
handy
from
now
on
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
which
is
why
i
like
it
and
i
chuckle
when
people
order
a
bud
or
something
after
saying
guinness
is
too
filling
and
has
too
many
calories
its
got
quite
a
mythology
associated
with
it
thats
for
sure
easy
to
drink
quickly
many
times
out
this
is
the
best
beer
ontap
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
subdued
flavors
but
true
to
the
style
definition
of
the
style
and
bland
enough
to
be
highly
drinkable
not
much
different
from
the
nitro
can
except
for
maybe
the
size
of
the
head
not
my
preferred
way
of
drinking
this
beer
i
probably
will
just
stick
to
the
cans
drinkablilty
i
finished
about
half
the
glass
and
gave
the
rest
a
drain
pour
i
havent
done
this
to
too
many
beers
but
i
just
couldnt
finish
this
one
i
thought
i
was
going
to
throw
up
mouthfeel
is
of
burnt
wood
bitterness
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
vanilla
lingering
to
a
sweet
finish
medium
bodied
and
slightly
astringent
pours
out
a
cloudy
pale
that
falls
like
a
waterfall
into
black
with
a
thick
head
that
stays
throughout
the
whole
beer
the
smell
is
roasty
and
light
with
some
sweet
molasses
tones
in
it
taste
is
watery
and
its
hard
to
detect
but
once
you
get
a
taste
its
not
great
the
roasty
flavors
have
turned
into
a
chemical
flavor
that
makes
me
cringe
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
unimpressive
i
dont
think
ill
ever
have
this
ever
again
drinkability
yum
if
you
like
u
k
stouts
you
will
definately
like
this
beer
if
not
then
quit
reading
this
review
right
now
anyway
its
nicely
balanced
in
all
respects
and
the
nitrogen
charging
makes
a
good
beer
great
typical
guinness
in
a
bottle
with
a
widget
rather
than
can
i
dont
really
get
it
its
in
the
bottle
so
you
can
drink
it
out
of
the
bottle
right
since
when
did
it
become
so
hard
to
find
glassware
hell
a
plastic
pint
glass
will
do
but
i
guess
this
is
all
about
show
in
any
case
i
found
it
no
different
from
the
canned
version
i
didnt
think
the
widget
did
as
good
a
job
but
that
was
with
a
single
pour
with
just
a
few
pauses
along
the
way
the
color
is
sublime
and
the
head
is
there
all
the
way
through
it
is
always
hard
for
me
to
describe
the
taste
of
stout
to
other
people
but
in
comparison
to
other
stouts
ive
had
this
one
reaches
the
best
balance
its
not
too
bitter
not
too
heavy
the
perfect
roasted
flavor
without
overpowering
works
great
with
just
about
any
type
of
food
and
is
light
enough
to
drink
by
itself
ive
had
it
both
on
tap
and
in
the
nitro
can
and
i
find
that
they
are
indistinguishable
from
each
other
always
great
poured
over
a
bent
spoon
atop
bass
pale
ale
or
harp
lager
as
well
now
in
a
new
plastic
wrapped
bottle
with
instructions
at
the
bottom
that
state
serve
extra
cold
they
must
relly
be
trying
to
get
to
the
masses
with
that
and
the
cheesy
bottle
wrapping
beyond
that
its
a
pretty
good
easily
found
stout
packaged
in
the
11
2oz
nitro
bottle
there
is
no
information
given
about
freshness
but
some
nutriant
info
is
given
and
there
is
the
cool
widget
inside
the
bottle
when
the
cap
is
popped
you
hear
the
nitrogen
bubbling
through
the
beer
this
beer
is
one
of
the
more
impressive
looking
beers
out
there
as
it
was
poured
into
my
bells
pint
glass
a
creamy
head
instantly
formed
with
nitrogen
bubbles
cascading
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
after
settiling
a
bit
a
creamy
tan
half
inch
head
remains
throughout
the
whole
experience
the
beer
is
very
dark
hints
of
brown
are
visible
when
held
to
the
light
but
this
brew
is
pretty
opaque
aroma
presents
a
creamy
roastyness
with
a
mild
sour
side
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
dry
faint
hints
of
roasted
malt
are
present
there
is
a
slight
sourness
to
this
beer
according
to
charlie
papazian
guiness
adds
a
bit
of
pasteurized
sour
beer
to
each
batch
of
guiness
overall
a
pretty
bland
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
thick
as
a
stout
should
be
but
something
seems
to
be
missing
maybe
not
thick
enough
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
but
unfortunately
it
costs
about
8
50
for
a
sixer
of
11
2oz
bottle
when
i
go
to
the
store
and
i
see
small
bottles
of
guiness
for
the
same
price
as
regular
bottle
of
bells
double
cream
stout
i
choose
the
bells
if
this
were
cheaper
id
like
it
more
but
its
just
not
worth
it
poured
from
a
nitrocan
into
a
pint
glass
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
appearance
wise
the
beer
pours
a
fantastic
1inch
head
that
never
quite
goes
away
leaving
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
creamy
kind
of
like
chocolate
milk
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
being
very
creamy
with
a
slight
chocolaty
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
imo
for
a
stout
this
is
an
exceptionally
easy
beer
to
drink
a
great
session
beer
served
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
very
well
retained
head
as
well
as
good
lacing
at
first
the
smell
is
smokey
with
hints
of
nuts
the
beer
feels
great
and
is
well
carbonated
not
too
much
a
very
smokey
taste
with
caramel
flavorings
coming
out
first
time
having
one
and
it
went
down
smooth
i
will
definately
try
this
agian
next
time
im
out
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
the
faintest
of
light
just
barely
shining
through
the
glass
there
was
a
large
creamy
head
that
is
typical
for
the
nitro
stouts
aroma
was
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
taste
was
coffeeish
and
roasty
with
a
light
sourness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
creamy
and
smooth
making
this
very
drinkable
this
type
of
stout
lacks
the
character
that
the
regular
bottled
version
is
known
for
but
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
is
very
sessionable
with
its
light
character
and
low
alcohol
given
a
choice
between
the
standard
macro
light
beers
and
this
the
guinness
draft
wins
every
time
lastly
for
relatively
lowcarb
beers
this
isnt
half
bad
only
9
9
g
per
12
oz
much
better
than
most
other
sub10g
beers
da
the
low
abv
makes
this
an
allday
drinker
and
you
gotta
respect
the
classics
d
flavourful
low
in
alcohol
easy
on
the
gas
quite
drinkable
first
time
in
a
long
time
trying
this
brew
on
draught
is
one
of
the
most
classic
and
endearing
moments
in
beer
the
look
of
the
nitrocarbonation
sheading
the
beer
and
floating
to
the
top
is
something
special
the
head
retention
is
basically
a
milk
shake
for
stout
lovers
slight
aromas
of
roasted
grains
chalkiness
and
mild
souring
flavors
and
moderate
and
firm
ranging
from
charcoal
roasted
grains
mild
lactose
and
and
underlying
sweet
maltiness
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
always
supurb
full
and
creamy
then
thinning
into
a
powdery
soft
finish
quite
dry
and
fleeting
in
the
aftertaste
its
the
taste
that
defined
the
style
how
can
it
be
anything
but
great
pours
a
cascading
black
with
a
tightlypacked
creamy
offwhite
head
looks
good
despite
the
bottle
saying
drink
straight
from
the
bottle
lots
of
gloppy
lacing
as
only
guinness
can
do
aroma
is
nice
fresh
guinness
draught
coffee
grounds
burnt
toast
lots
of
roasted
malt
taste
is
creamy
coffee
front
roasted
malty
middle
and
slightly
sour
burnt
finish
mouthfeel
was
creamy
smooth
lovely
brew
as
always
good
stout
poured
can
into
a
glass
mug
let
settle
beautiful
dark
and
tan
color
with
a
offwhite
head
you
can
smell
the
hops
as
soon
as
its
poured
can
taste
a
pleasantly
slight
bitter
taste
with
a
strong
roasted
barley
aftertaste
very
smooth
and
thick
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
but
one
should
do
you
good
for
a
little
while
due
to
its
thickness
drinkability
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
it
isnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
will
do
just
nicely
at
the
beer
full
of
swill
for
the
price
that
people
pay
for
guinness
you
would
be
better
off
buying
murphys
stout
or
any
other
craft
stout
with
more
character
d
extremely
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
could
watch
a
football
game
with
out
one
out
of
a
nitro
can
this
is
a
classic
and
beautiful
beer
black
even
when
held
up
to
the
light
and
a
creamy
smooth
head
one
of
my
favorites
before
i
really
knew
anything
about
beer
but
now
i
realize
that
there
is
very
little
complexity
to
this
brew
and
it
is
not
quite
as
stout
as
a
stout
should
be
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
an
obvious
chocolaty
finish
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
but
leaving
something
to
be
desired
if
you
want
a
really
good
stout
the
drinkability
was
average
or
maybe
a
bit
better
but
i
did
not
get
a
second
mk
eric
if
you
want
an
intro
to
stouts
this
is
the
classic
brew
its
easy
to
drink
looks
pretty
and
is
available
just
about
anywhere
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
in
ireland
one
day
where
i
hear
the
taste
is
much
different
until
then
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
alternative
brilliant
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
a
classic
in
every
sense
smell
is
a
little
smokey
and
a
litte
roasted
taste
is
mostly
roasted
bitterness
not
a
very
strong
taste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
i
prefer
more
carbonation
in
a
beer
while
its
not
my
first
choice
of
stouts
its
a
readily
available
and
a
nicely
drinkable
session
beer
as
my
glass
says
its
a
lovely
day
for
a
guinness
i
guess
you
arent
supposed
to
pour
this
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
love
that
thick
pour
i
guess
they
put
the
widget
in
a
bottle
for
those
who
fear
canned
beer
nothing
different
here
just
smooth
velvety
light
bitter
choclate
and
burnt
coffee
with
that
classic
tang
from
the
little
proportion
of
soured
beer
very
drinkable
and
lacking
in
character
with
every
successive
time
i
buy
one
only
once
every
few
months
just
as
a
benchmark
stout
refresher
course
just
because
there
are
so
many
more
flavorful
versions
out
there
is
no
reason
to
disparage
this
old
standby
we
all
remember
a
time
when
we
looked
up
to
this
beer
in
awe
and
admiration
pours
neatly
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
the
brown
foam
eventually
settles
out
to
a
dark
ruby
red
as
seen
through
the
glass
when
held
upto
a
light
smells
of
sour
dough
and
faint
spice
head
is
creamy
and
thick
like
yeast
foam
when
making
bread
unpleasantly
sour
tasting
makes
this
beer
not
easily
drank
not
smooth
my
taste
buds
became
overwhelmed
with
the
sourness
and
bitterness
through
out
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
very
drinkable
goes
great
with
vanilla
ice
cream
or
even
stout
floats
i
love
this
one
i
can
drink
these
like
theres
no
tomorrow
a
great
session
beer
this
is
the
standard
for
irish
stouts
the
grandpappy
of
them
all
the
drinkability
factor
is
through
the
roof
in
my
estimation
you
have
all
of
the
more
appealing
components
of
beer
that
make
it
grand
a
dark
and
substantial
flavour
with
a
well
titrated
richness
that
never
overwhelms
coupled
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
deceiving
and
vacillates
betwixt
thickness
and
light
qualities
this
beer
just
provokes
me
to
sip
it
incessantly
with
the
somewhat
slight
abv
one
can
enjoy
copious
amounts
of
this
and
never
become
burdened
by
the
effects
this
is
truly
worthy
of
my
praise
well
crafted
easy
to
consume
just
plain
enjoyable
i
regret
that
i
paid
this
beer
no
heed
for
such
a
long
while
as
now
it
is
a
regular
denizen
of
my
cooling
chamber
live
and
learn
i
am
not
sure
if
i
have
ever
had
the
foreign
stout
or
extra
draught
but
i
look
forward
to
their
example
because
this
one
just
does
not
do
it
for
me
compared
to
all
the
much
more
flavourful
and
stronger
american
stouts
give
me
a
murphys
any
day
of
the
week
over
this
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
has
a
very
pleasant
texture
drinkability
is
very
good
especially
with
42
alcohol
in
it
its
a
session
ale
so
of
course
this
beer
is
drinkable
moreso
if
you
serve
extra
cold
water
down
beer
that
id
just
drink
to
get
drunk
fast
because
the
nitrogen
bubbles
allow
me
to
imbibe
fast
i
do
like
the
new
bottle
design
but
if
you
want
a
real
stout
try

i
will
stick
to
the
real
guinness
now
it
is
perhaps
my
favorite
beer
i
am
in
preparation
for
my
oktoberfest
party
and
decided
to
try
out
the
1985
munich
oktoberfest
stein
i
have
just
bought
the
decision
was
made
to
christen
it
with
two
nitro
bottles
of
guinness
i
find
that
as
i
age
i
appreciate
guinness
for
its
robust
flavors
and
its
smooth
nature

in

not
as

stimulating

i
would
have
hoped

i
suppose
ive
been
into
storm
king
excellent
cuts
the
bloating
down
a
bit
drinkability
is
just
outstanding
and
id
session
with
this
any
day
if
everyone
else
brings
the
regular
bmc
products
to
a
get
together
the
taste
is
just
brilliant
the
first
is
lost
in
the
bottle
pours
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
head
is
thick
and
tasty
really
adds
to
the
taste
no
huge
aroma
going
on
here
i
couldnt
pull
much
away
from
this
one
a
hint
of
the
usual
a
very
subtle
taste
not
as
powerful
as
other
irish
stouts
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
very
tiny
amount
of
a
burnt
flavor
this
beer
has
no
bite
and
i
find
it
is
one
of
the
only
stouts
does
not
get
better
as
it
warms
up
the
flavor
stays
consistant
but
the
creamy
texture
really
is
lackluster
under
warmer
temperatures
the
beer
is
full
bodied
but
with
less
flavor
than
you
would
think
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
great
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
creamy
stout
served
from
a
can
with
nitro
thingamabob
im
not
sure
why
this
version
of
ges
gets
such
rave
reviews
this
rendition
of
ges
is
truly
offensive
yes
it
pours
black
with
typical
nitro
foamy
head
but
the
taste
is
so
thin
so
metalic
with
utterly
no
toasted
coffee
or
carmel
notes
that
i
wondered
if
i
was
in
fact
drinking
a
guinnes
miller
genuine
draft
has
as
much
character
this
beer
is
all
gimmick
and
no
heart
i
gave
the
remainer
of
the
4
pack
to
a
neighbour
if
i
ever
drink
guinnes
again
it
will
be
from
a
bottle
the
appearance
is
what
first
sells
it
the
turn
to
black
is
always
a
cool
thing
to
watch
it
has
a
mild
coffee
smell
and
taste
to
it
and
the
roasted
malts
are
apparent
throughout
the
stout
there
is
also
a
thick
creamy
head
and
a
surpisingly
smooth
taste
i
thought
that
this
would
be
a
thicker
beer
than
it
turned
out
to
be
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
only
because
it
is
so
dumbed
down
for
mass
consumption
in
my
opinion
not
one
of
the
better
dry
irish
stouts
out
there
ah
guinness
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
pours
dark
brown
with
some
tinges
of
ruby
red
in
there
when
i
hold
it
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
about
34
inches
high
creamy
and
tan
the
aroma
isnt
strong
but
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
coffee
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
way
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
coffee
and
some
chocolate
theres
a
nice
slight
bitter
aftertaste
as
well
its
very
creamy
and
smooth
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
in
my
opinion
its
a
great
beer
especially
because
of
the
way
it
looks
the
taste
is
good
too
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
bad
guinness
of
course
its
always
better
on
tap
somewhere
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
anyone
this
beer
obviously
has
its
positives
and
negatives
what
it
lacks
in
taste
it
makes
up
for
in
a
really
cool
look
and
drinkability
had
this
on
tap
at
a
bar
i
saw
the
bartender
pour
it
and
he
poured
it
straight
down
the
glass
creating
a
ton
of
head
that
slowly
but
surely
turned
to
a
pitch
black
beer
in
front
of
me
im
not
sure
if
thats
how
its
supposed
to
be
poured
i
usually
see
bartenders
taking
their
time
with
pouring
a
guiness
but
this
one
just
set
the
glass
down
pulled
the
tap
walked
away
and
did
something
else
either
way
my
beer
arrived
and
was
exactly
as
every
pint
of
guinness
ive
had
before
an
awesome
12
white
head
sits
atop
a
black
body
for
the
entire
time
you
drink
not
much
of
anything
in
the
nose
and
only
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
flavor
in
the
taste
if
i
focus
and
let
my
imagination
go
wild
i
can
maybe
fool
myself
into
tasting
some
chocolate
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
but
watery
in
a
weird
way
this
beer
is
a
session
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
drinkability
ive
had
something
of
an
ongoing
debate
as
to
whether
i
prefer
the
draught
or
the
extra
stout
and
the
conclusion
i
think
ive
come
ot
is
that
the
extra
stout
is
a
better
beer
but
i
wish
it
had
some
nitro
i
suppose
the
moral
of
the
story
is
just
get
it
on
tap
the
sweet
finish
does
hurt
the
drinkability
a
bit
though
had
this
most
recently
at
buffalo
wild
wings
the
beer
of
course
looks
fantastic
guinness
has
a
very
unique
as
far
as
im
concerned
look
being
pitch
black
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
lasts
forever
it
is
one
of
the
most
daunting
readily
available
beers
for
people
to
try
its
very
cool
to
watch
the
beer
settle
i
never
take
a
sip
and
usually
dont
take
my
eyes
off
of
the
glass
till
its
done
it
smells
bitter
cant
really
pick
out
any
particulars
it
tastes
good
to
me
its
a
very
subtly
flavour
tasted
a
little
smokey
a
little
bitter
my
girlfriend
said
it
tasted
like
bacon
but
i
have
no
idea
what
she
was
talking
about
the
mouthfeel
again
is
very
unique
to
me
has
a
flat
but
still
carbonated
feel
i
like
it
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
your
typical
beer
its
a
slow
drink
and
i
can
normally
only
take
2
or
3
before
i
switch
to
something
else
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
classic
guinness
is
overall
a
wonderful
beverage
the
hints
of
coffee
are
one
of
the
flavors
i
like
the
most
about
this
beverage
not
to
mention
its
opaque
color
and
traditional
white
head
this
beer
is
definitely
in
the
upper
eschelon
in
my
own
opinion
anyway
as
far
as
price
goes
it
can
get
a
little
pricey
but
you
pay
for
what
you
get
all
too
often
when
it
comes
to
beer
and
im
not
hurting
to
pay
a
couple
of
extra
dollars
for
personal
enjoyment
though
i
wouldnt
recommend
drinking
too
many
in
a
sitting
if
youre
trying
to
keep
away
a
beer
gut
appearance
of
this
beer
is
great
unfortunatly
that
is
where
the
impressing
stops
solid
inky
black
color
that
cascades
for
a
while
after
the
pour
frothy
brown
head
that
has
incredible
retention
the
smell
is
average
for
a
stout
sweet
coffee
and
creme
with
some
roasted
and
chocolate
hints
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
very
much
like
an
iced
latte
or
something
of
the
sort
quite
sweet
and
filling
but
not
much
malty
goodness
in
most
good
stouts
for
how
deep
this
beer
is
it
has
a
very
light
body
this
is
a
beer
to
make
average
beer
drinkers
feel
like
good
beer
drinkers
it
is
not
impressive
after
you
have
tried
some
good
stouts
i
do
remember
my
first
guinness
how
rough
it
was
for
me
flavor
was
too
strong
or
i
wasnt
used
to
drinking
a
nonyellow
beer
etc
this
time
it
was
a
little
too
easy
to
throw
back
weak
aroma
weak
flavor
almost
no
carbonation
a
stout
for
the
masses
i
should
add
that
i
like
the
bottled
nonnitro
regular
guinness
it
is
one
of
those
beers
i
have
a
lovehate
relation
with
but
i
always
warm
up
to
it
after
a
few
days
that
beer
exists
on
its
own
feet
this
really
wants
to
be
something
else
and
fails
miserably
still
a
standard
mouthfeeldrinkability
what
begins
as
a
watery
thin
entry
expands
eversoslightly
and
develops
a
creaminess
that
improves
the
texture
although
the
carbonation
is
downplayed
in
favor
of
smoothness
i
do
not
miss
it
here
this
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
finest
session
beers
of
all
time
for
obvious
reasons
had
this
on
tap
at
a
bar
last
night
for
the
first
time
i
loved
it
coffee
was
the
most
recognizable
taste
in
this
beer
overall
it
was
very
creamy
and
smooth
going
down
a
friend
next
to
me
had
some
and
said
they
tasted
grapefruit
i
wish
more
people
drank
guinness
guinness
draught
is
something
i
drink
when
i
want
to
sit
and
enjoy
a
beer
thats
pretty
good
but
wont
get
me
too
buzzed
to
do
stuff
that
needs
to
be
done
i
dont
buy
it
that
often
though
because
theres
planty
of
other
stuff
thats
asa
good
or
better
for
the
money
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
it
absolutely
fits
the
style
intended
cheers
if
you
like
stouts
this
one
is
a
great
one
to
try
and
if
you
have
not
had
a
guinness
before
try
and
have
one
on
tap
its
worth
a
try
smooth
light
mouthfeel
with
a
velvety
carbonation
burnt
malts
then
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
with
grapefruit
rind
flavor
a
barest
hint
of
balancing
sweetness
it
really
is
better
in
the
uk
when
you
have
it
fresh
on
tap
the
fruity
light
hoppy
character
is
completely
lost
on
the
trip
over
leaving
little
complexity
in
the
american
version
an
alright
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
as
stouts
go
it
is
not
my
fav
but
i
still
would
recommend
you
have
one
or
two
when
i
drink
a
guinness
i
really
get
the
feeling
that
im
sitting
in
a
pub
drinking
a
traditional
european
beer
nothing
great
but
still
enjoyable
this
stuff
is
amazing
its
hard
to
believe
this
is
beer
very
creamy
texture
with
a
very
unique
flavor
unlike
any
other
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
has
a
long
white
creamy
head
and
it
hangs
around
for
the
entire
life
of
the
glass
this
is
something
to
try
if
you
are
into
different
kinds
of
brews
for
me
this
is
damn
good
stuff
awesome
for
winter
time
i
have
been
drinking
this
more
often
lately
its
available
much
more
than
most
other
premium
type
beers
the
bottle
has
a
rocket
in
it
not
sure
on
the
concept
but
it
takes
up
space
and
gives
me
less
beer
i
dont
like
that
part
but
if
it
keeps
it
fresher
ill
deal
w
it
the
look
is
nice
very
dark
w
a
lacy
head
not
as
spectacular
as
the
extra
stout
but
still
a
nice
presentation
the
smell
is
nutty
w
a
slight
toffee
scent
possibly
tastes
good
avoid
the
bottle
the
tap
is
still
the
best
the
can
is
nearly
as
good
the
bottle
is
not
worth
it
its
drinkability
is
average
for
me
i
am
just
waiting
to
try
one
in
ireland
as
i
feel
i
will
learn
to
appreciate
it
once
again
for
right
now
a
good
pour
of
this
brew
is
terribly
hard
to
find
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
enjoy
on
tap
for
appearance
from
tap
it
has
a
nice
chocolate
coloration
to
it
smell
is
very
aromatic
and
enjoyable
not
really
hoppy
smell
but
mellow
smell
as
for
taste
it
has
a
great
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
to
it
and
i
find
it
to
easier
to
drink
around
55
degrees
farenheit
mouthfeel
well
to
be
honest
here
i
dont
really
notice
any
cause
i
down
it
quite
fast
but
drinkability
slpendid
very
very
nice
it
is
a
well
made
no
well
crafted
beer
enjoy
poors
an
opaque
garnet
with
a
frothy
creamy
tan
head
the
head
on
this
beer
keeps
going
like
the
energizer
bunny
aroma
is
mild
roasted
malt
light
bodied
for
what
appears
to
be
a
heavy
beer
roasted
malt
flavors
with
a
hint
of
coffeetoffee
character
bitterness
seems
to
come
from
the
roast
malt
but
is
just
the

balanced

classic
beer
easy

time
for
nother
pours
a
deep
black
coffee
color
with
a
dense
one

thick
tan
cap
the
cap
lingers
and
settles
to
a
quarter
inch
but
leaves
froth
behind
on
sides
of
glass
aroma
is
coffee
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
medium
body
feel
that
is
a
little
more
watery
than
creamy
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
nice
caramel
maltiness
surrounded
by
a
very
pleasing
hop
bitterness
light
coffee
flavor
to
give
some
depth
has
that
good
ole
irish
flavor
great
beer
anyway
you
have
it
goes
down
smooth
and
refreshing
good
stuff
drinkability
i
wonder
if
the
higher
alcohol
version
we
cant
get
in
the
states
is
also
more
complex
if
thats
the
case
then
maybe
we
should
indeed
take
a
chance
on
trying
to
get
some
over
here
maybe
still
though
this
is
one
of
the
most
overrated
and
consumed
stouts
in
the
country
i
will
buy
it
once
in
a
while
to
watch
the
magic
happening
on
the
glass
and
have
a
stout
thats
easy
to
drink
when
i
want
a
few
and
dont
want
to
worry
about
sipping
one
or
two
all
night
what
the
hell
happened
to
guiness
i
remember
getting
this
when
i
was
younger
and
it
didnt
taste
this
watered
down
for
a
stout
what
the
hell
happened
i
will
give
extra
stout
a
try
sometime
perhaps
cause
this
isnt
cutting
it
but
on
the
other
hand
guiness
has
the
stats
of
a
light
beer
with
120
calories
so
i
guess
it
would
be
alright
for
a
light
beer
but
man
notes
well
i
have
alsways
had
a
thing
for
guinness
as
it
was
a
good
starting
point
for
me
getting
into
trying
different
beers
in
my
college
days
however
now
it
really
pales
flavorwise
in
comparison
to
other
stouts
still
a
good
beer
to
drink
at
the
local
dives
with
bad
selections
when
im
out
with
my
friends
okay
where
to
start
serve
extra
cold
drink
straight
from
the
bottle
neither
inspire
confidence
i
like
some
nitro
stouts
but
not
in
a
west
coast
usa
offwhite
and
inpenatrable
layer
much
lace
was
left
on
my
pint
the
color
of
the
beer
is

characterisitics
are
very
similar
to
my
review
of
this
in
the
nitrocan
coffee
like
and
soft
on
the
palate
after
a
little
research
for
the
money
opinion
well
i
just
keep
trying
this
beer
as
i
want
to
see
what
difference
it
makes
between
the
different
packaging
techniques
i
dont
think
that
it
makes
much
difference
this
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
and
i
cant
hardly
imagine
being
able
to
drink
enough
to
get
drunk
on
these
ill
stick
with
their
export
i
tried
to
brew
my
own
guiness
and
though
i
did
obtain
a
decent
flavour
i
could
not
imitate
the
perfect
head
this
beer
posess
all
those
that
believe
that
guiness
is
overrated
will
disagree
but
i
think
this
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
somewhat
close
approximation
of
guinnes
on
tap
but
it
doesnt
quite
measure
up
it
is
pretty
in
the
glass
although
the
bubbles
and
head
recede
more
quickly
than
on
tap
the
major
difference
is
the
thin
moutfeel
it
isnt
as
creamy
and
delcicious
as
it
is
on
tap
everything
elsethe
roasty
coffee
taste
and
good
drinkabilityis
about
the
same
mouthfeel
i
feel
like
the
bottle
is
always
a
little
more
watery
than
i
would
care
for
it
is
lighter
and
not
quite
as
creamy
yet
still
has
a
comfortable
body
and
still
enjoyable
all
in
all
i
still
think
it
really
a
decent
beer
even
out
of
the
bottle
a
dark
brown
black
beer
has
a
creamy
nitro
type
dark
beige
head
with
a
good
lace
a
lot
of
chocolate
at
first
milk
chocolate
in
the
aroma
followed
by
some
hints
of
toffee
and
a
coffee
bitterness
in
the
background
the
first
sip
give
a
chocolate
note
the
second
leaves
more
dark
roasted
malt
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
burnt
toast
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
seemed
a
bit
watery
to
me
this
is
the
only
beer
so
far
that
ive
reviewed
twice
simply
because
there
are
so
many
ways
to
get
a
guinness
around
here
cant
say
that
for
most
beers
in
canada
its
pretty
odd
when
the
head
is
the
best
part
of
a
brew
by
quite
a
ways
this
never
got
off
the
ground
even
when
i
tried
pouring
it
at
different
temperatures
between
the
served
chilled
suggestion
i
always
thought
guinness
should
be
served
around
5055
degress
fahrenheit
and
the
edges
of
the
beer
being
a
deep
reddish
instead
of
a
uniform
black
i
think
they
dropped
the
ball
on
this
is
it
true
that
not
all
guinness
is
brewed
at
saint
james
gate
but
also
in
canada
my
next
serving
of
this
will
be
on
tap
brilliant
stick
with
the
extra
stout
served
from
a
nitro
can
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
that
i
purchased
at
the
guinness
brewery
a
few
years
what
a
nice
st
patricks
day
treat
the
beer
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
active
bubbling
activity
from
the
nitro
in
the
can
interesting
to
watch
as
it
settles
after
the
beer
settles
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
i
get
is
of
some
nice
toasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
nice
lingering
tongue
of
sweet
toasted
malts
that
is
very
drinkable
despite
the
slightly
heavy
body
i
could
drink
these
all
night
on
tap
but
for
some
reason
i
refuse
to
buy
at
the
store
in
bottles
and
cans
i
always
find
myself
ordering
this
beer
at
the
bar
for
a
good
session
i
cant
think
of
anything
better
pours
blacker
than
a
saharan
night
during
an
eclipse
nitro
bubbles
rise
and
fall
in
a
hypnotizing
dance
that
invites
a
sip
head
is
a
thick
dense
and
tan
smells
like
toasty
malt
hops
are
nowhere
in
the
nose
once
in
the
mouth
it
loses
some
of
its
luster
it
has
that
toasty
dry
malt
i
love
but
it
is
just
plain
watery
compared
to
other
offerings
drinkability
i
can
drink
guinness
until
i
blackout
low
abv
and
the
watered
down
taste
makes
it
slip
down
as
easy
as
taking

consider
this
the

turn
to
it

the
goal
is

one

beer
came
a
dark
brown
that
let
a
lot
of
light
through
giving
it
some
burgundy
highlights
the
head
was
a
lovely
pale
tan
that
was
flat
and
creamy
smells
of
delightfully
toasted
malts
with
a
distinctive
sweet
and
sourness
behind
it
that
i
can
only
say
smells
like
guinness
tastes
initially
of
a
cocktail
of
dry
roasted
malts
that
springs
to
life
with
a
pleasantly
subdued
sweetness
almost
charcoal
like
also
if
sampling
in
a
ber
has
red
hair
and
a
slight
bit
of
coffee
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
as
always
it
pours
to
a
beautiful
dark
opaque
color
the
head
is
thick
and
maybe
i
ruined
it
with
the
poor
given
the
color
hint
of
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
sour
bitter
flavor
with
light
coffee
but
ive
come
across
lots
of
much
better

live

let
me
say
this
is
the
single
most
appealing
beverage
ive
ever
seen
a
lot
of
people
use
the
comparisons
to
say
motor
oil
to
describe
the
appearance
i
never
understood
that
from
the
very
first
time
i
saw
guinness
and
does
not
linger
i
assume
this
is
because
the
bitterness
comes
from
the
very
dark
malts
rather
than
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
but
above
most
it
is
the
classic
beer
for
guys
it
has
one
of
the
best
heads
on
it
and
is
known
around
the
world
for
its
taste
and
ability
to
heal
stuff
not
really
sure
about
that
it
has
a
dark
complexion
i
started
homebrewing
so
that
i
could
make
something
similar
that
wouldnt
cost
me
a
fortune
im
not
quite

was

i
finally
did
i
could

disappointed
the
idea
that
this

at
best
stout
tastes
better
in

it
does
at
i
really
used

like
guinness
when
i
first
got
into
drinking
better
beer
since
ive
been
checking
out
this
site
and
trying
new
beers
all
the
time
i
really
kind
of
forgot
about
it
and
havent
had
it
in
a
while
last
night
in
honor
of
st
pattys
i
started
my
night
off
with
a
guinness
on
tap
i
really
wasnt
too
impressed
i
mean
it
still
has
those
typical
guinness
things
that
you
like
the
nice
classic
guinness
appearance
the
aftertaste
keeps
me
coming
back
to
this
beer
time
and
time
again
its
not
as
dry
as
others
i
have
had
in
the
past
couple
of
days
i
think
guinness
may
have
been
toppled
as
the
best
irish
stout
in
my
book
i
still
like
and
enjoy
it

accompanied

i
politely
told

that
this
was

another

all
they
had
was

rather
than
being

it

although
i
recognize
the
shortcomings
of
this
beer
it
remains
one
of
my
favorite
standbys
the
appearance
of
a
well
poured
guinness
is
really
a
thing
behold
with
it
dark
brown
colornear
black
color
a
guinness
head
should
really
be
the
standard
for
all
stouts
brown
creamy
pillowy
soft
perfect
unfortunately
the
taste
of
guinness
does
not
match
its
presentation
it
is
a
rather
bland
stout
it
is
good
but
not
great
with
coffee
being
the
only
real
flavor
i
can
discern
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
stout
but
overall
the
brew
is
highly
drinkable
with
a
low
abv
i
love
it
and
can
see
its
flaws
but
it
remains
a
favorite
overall
one
of
my
favorites
that
is
consistant
and
available
dark
brownalmost
black
in
color
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
takes
forever
to
settle
best
looking
beer
ever
the
beer
itself
is
thick
and
it
actually
has
a
hint
of
coffe
flavor
tastewise
imo
it
is
the
best
beer
made
by
a
large
company
however
i
have
actually
tasted
better
micro
stouts
my
only
complaint
is
that
after
2
im
done
2
fills
you
up
like
you
just
ate
a
meal
im
a
sucker
for
the
guinness
cascade
though
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
great
even
just
based
on
its
midnight
darkness
and
bronze
head
smell
is
relatively
muted
though
some
of
the
smoothness
and
roastiness
comes
through
taste
is
good
but
not
exceptional
highlighted
by
roasted
chococoffee
flavors
and
a
nice
sweetness
that
is
a
big
part
of
this
beers
impressive
drinkability
honestly
i
do
not
often
drink
stout
beers
i
am
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
definitely
makes
me
have
second
thoughts
it
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
nice
dark
creamy
color
in
the
glass
it
is
very
dark
with
hints
of
dark
ruby
coloring
if
the
light
hits
it
right
and
has
an
excellent
thick
creamy
head
that
does
not
go
anywhere
until
you
start
drinking
the
smell
is
mostly
cocoa
with
light
hints
of
coffee
and
with
hops
right
on
top
the
taste
is
also
chocolatey
with
a
superb
combination
of
roasted
malts
this
brew
is
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
even
smoother
the
drinkability
is
good
even
though
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
that
is
just
personal
preference
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
has
not
yet
tried
it
while
there
are
many
stouts
out
there
now
that
put
guinness
any
version
to
shame
its
still
a
classic
worth
revisiting
over
and
over
if
youre
going
to
drink
one
do
it
right
and
get
it
straight
from
the
tap
yuk
sorry
but
there
it
is
not
a
fan
of
this
style
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
once
said
i
have
never
met
a
beer
i
didnt
like
now
i
have
i
am
depressed
oh
well
somebody
pass
me
a
aschi
super
dry
please
amazing
cascading
effect
that
leads
to
a
pitch
black
beer
with
a
tannish
creamy
head
that
clings
to
sides
of
the
glass
sweetish
malt
aroma
with
a
silky
smooth
taste
that
so
easy
to
drink
slightly
different
from
can
to
tap
when
poured
it
has
a
nice
dark
opaque
color
that
is
dark
brownblack
the
head
is
not
quite
like
the
tap
but
not
bad
it
has
a
creamy
tanbeige
color
to
it
the
aroma
is
lighter
hints
of
coffee
malt
and
light
hops
the
flavor
is
creamy
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
i
believe
when
making
a
black
and
tan
at
home
the
flavors
of
the
can
of
this
guinness
meld
pretty
well
with
the
other
beer
to
give
a
quality
drink
a
tried
it
straight
out
of
the
bottlerecommended
and
in
the
glass
i
liked
it
much
better
out
of
the
glass
pours
a
beautiful
creamy
brown
head
that
stays
throught
the
whole
drink
i
like
guiness
extra
stout
better
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
stouts
a
wonderfull
beverage
and
one
that
can
be
drank
all
night
long
crisp
and
dry
with
a
wonderfull
smooth
mouthfell
and
the
sharp
coffee
bite
of
roast
malt
when
served
right
this
beer
is
just
dangerous
you
can
finish
a
pint
without
knowing
it
well
as
it
says
to
drink
directly
from
the
bottle
i
tried
it
that
way
quite
cold
and
another
cold
but
allowed
to
rest
in
my
pint
guinness
glass
i
snatched
from
st
james
gate
in
ireland
i
still
like
it
better
in
the
glass
pours
the
color
all
beer
should
be
dark
not
as
good
as
getting
a
pint
at
the
gate
but
quite
drinkable
nonetheless
it
doesnt
matter
if
you
like
this
beer
or
not
you
have
to
admit
that
the
appearance
it
amazing
thick
creamy
head
balanced
perfectly
on
top
of
a
solid
black
body
not
my
favorite
stout
and
it
bothers
me
a
bit
that
it
isnt
brewed
in
ireland
kind
of
watery
and
not
big
on
flavor
i
have
yet
to
try
this
in
ireland
but
i
hear
that
it
is
different
tasting
it
is
a
great
expereince
to
go
to
an
irish
pub
in
boston
in
the
afternoon
and
enjoy
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
guinness
in
my
book
dark
creamy
tasty
i
love
the
nitrogen
bubbles
too
amazingly
it
is
lighter
than
many
lights
that
are
on
the
market
while
still
being
delicious
its
a
masterpiece
a
benchmark
for
all
other
beers
to
rate
themselves
according
to
damn
fine
stout
a
globally
good
drink
canned
version
is
a
good
imintation
of
the
tap
stout
overall
not
a
bad
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
from
the
nitro
bottle
if
the
time
was
right
i
may
even
purchase
it
again
its
black
the
head
is
tanwhite
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
some
oily
coffee
beans
and
milk
the
taste
is
of
sour
roasted
burned
grain
water
and
soy
milk
the
texture
is
creamy
the
drinkability
is
excellent
you
can
drink
many
enjoy
had
to
try
the
plastic
bottle
with
the
widget
not
disappointed
because
i
had
no
exspectations
i
dont
know
what
the
widget
does
but
take
up
space
the
guinnness
tasted
very
watered
down
and
it
seemed
there
was
barely
any
in
the
bottle
i
think
they
should
end

quite

some

its

still

with
no

through
it
the
head
is
thick
and
apparent
throughout
the

guinness
aroma
is

with

tinge
from
the

sip
while
the
stout
style
is
not
my
favorite
i
do
enjoy
a
good
one
occasionaly
the
appearance
of
guiness
as
always
is
as
always
exceptional
not
for
the
novice
beer
drinker
your
typical
mass

drinker
needs
to
work
their

to
this
one
of

alot
of
the
appeal
has
to
do
with
the
pour
a
bartender
that
doesnt

heshe
is
doing
can
ruin
this
beer
if
your
half

like

or
tell
you
to
actually
drink
it
from
the
bottle
the
smooth
roast
malt
flavor
is
still
there
though
the
brew
also
seems
slightly
thinner
than
the
can
or
draught
versions
it
is
much
superior
to
the
regular
bottle
version
44
heres
the
nitro
can
perspective
on
guinness
it
suffers
in
the
can
perhaps
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
packaging
methods
the
canned
product
says
that
it
is
pasteurized
which
can
affect
flavor
adversely
secondly
when
tasted
side
by
side
with
the
beamish
nitro
can
stout
it
tastes
harsher
and
less
appealing
than
beamish
a
properly
poured
guinness
is
really
tough
to
beat
its
got
that
beautiful
dark
brown
almost
black
color
and
that
one
of
a
kind
head
that
makes
you
want
to
dig
in
with
a
spoon
the
flavor
is
complex
yet
understated
and
subtle
its
rich
and
creamy
and
goes
down
with
a
silky
perfection
just
the
thought
of
it
makes
me
want
to
run
to
the
nearest
pub
beautifully
thick
dense
tan
head
as
expected
intricate
lace
is
left
down
the
glass
deep
garnet
hue
and
very
clear
when
held
to
a
light
typically
attractive
for
guinness
malt
notes
are
mild
in
aroma
and
are
comprised
of
a
hint
of
sharp
dark
roasted
barley
sharpness
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
light
diacetyl
comes
through
as
the
beer
warms
roasted
grain
bitterness
dominates
the
flavor
while
hop
bitterness
seems
to
be
more
subdued
when
compared
to
draught
guinness
typically
smooth
nitroco2
mix
induced
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
soft
w
less
residual
roasted
grain
bitterness
than
the
draught
version
its
an
okay
dry
stout
but
even
canned
guinness
seems
to
have
more
character
everyone
knows
guinness
so
i
wont
get
too
detailed
guinness
is
my
default
beer
when
having
quests
as
it
is
usually
amenable
to
all
dark
black
with
an
o
so
creamy
head
nice
roasted
character
a
very
good
beer
especially
considering
the
volume
it
is
produced
in
dark
brownblack
thick
head
cascading
bubbles
is
a
sight
to
see
smooth
and
dry
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
a
hint
of
dark
toasted
malts
not
quite
as
complex
as
id
like
but
maybe
its
just
the
lack
of
traditional
carbonation
that
freaks
me
out
in
each
country
the
beer
varies
a
bit
to
meet
the
local
tastes
but
the
american
version
is
deep
black
in
color
with
a
dense
tan
head
of
foam
that
lasts
until
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
stout
also
features
a
surprisingly
fruity
aroma
amidst
the
massive
roasted
malt
nose
deep
rich
and
bitter
with
tinges
of
sourness
and
flavors
of
dark
roasted
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
and
malt
the
version
in
the
draughtcan
is
somewhat
thinner
in
body
and
less
fruity
and
therefore
more
drinkable
i
had
a
guinness
on
tap
after
a
round
of
golf
this
week
i
couldnt
believe
how
disappointed
i
was
this
brewery
gets
credits
for
its
longevity
and
ingenuity
the
beer
has
few
flaws
but
its
boring
it
simply
isnt
an
interesting
brew
the
nitrogeninduced
head
is
a
gimmick
and
the
character
has
been
dumbed
down
for
budweiser
tastes
go
for
the
extra
stout
bottle
if
you
insist
on
guinness
or
better
yet
go
for
a
local
or
regional
craft
stout
i
can
drink
it
endlessly
thats
why
i
always
buy
not
more
than
3
cans
a
time
what
can
i
say
about
guinness
that
hasnt
already
been
said
cascades
coffee
chocolate
the
only
bad
thing
about
guinness
in
my
mind
is
that
it
goes
down
a
little
too
easy
i
didnt
try
it
before
last
night
because
theres
just
something
wrong
with
drinking
from
the
bottle
you
dont
get
to
see
the
beer
you
miss
out
on
99
of
the
aroma
its
just
plain
barbaric
so
yeah
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
rate
couldnt
see
it
couldnt
really
smell
it
it
tasted
ok
but
compared
to
the
guinness
i
had
offthetap
earlier
in
the
evening
it
was
rather
lacking
1

its
different
compared
to

but
i
find
it
much
better
than
the
nitrocan
im
suprised
by
the
poor
reviews
let
it
infuse
for
a
minute
or
two
before
your
first
sip
guinness
is
definitely
an
acquired
taste
as
are
many
darker
beers
being
that
it
is
everywhere
i
finally
got
the
palate
for
it
and
now
it
seems
like
a
very
light
beer
in
comparison
to
many
the
appearance
when
poured
correctly
is
pure
perfection
its
like
a
painting
smooth
as
any
beer
you
can
find
creamy
with
mild
bitter
notes
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
after
a
few
is
rather
filling
but
i
would
not
say
it
is
a
heavy
beer
at
all
finally
have
sampled
guinness
in
ireland
and
i
dont
know
if
its
the
atmosphere
of
that
beautiful
country
or
the
wonderful
pubs
and
people
but
guinness
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
things
in
ireland
more
than
anywhere
else
not
the
most
flavorful
of
stouts
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
a
classic
in
its
own
right
whats
next
guinness
40s
a
strong
black
smooth
but
dry
stout
im
not
quite
sure
how
much
value
the
plastic
widget
adds
but
it
tastes
just
exactly
like
every
guinness
i
have
had
quite
frankly
i
think
guinness
is
overrated
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
very
much
above
average
but
if
i
have
the
choice
of
the
two
ill
take
beamish
its
still
a
good
stout
but
if
you
stick
it
next
to
a
shakespeare
stout
its
no
contest
still
guinness
is
a
good
measuring
stick
for
the
style
since
at
least
from
what
i
read
on
this
site
it
was
the
first
stout
as
guinness
wandered
deeper
into
the
black
as
their
porter
transformed
into
the
first
stout
the
true
pub
classic
i
have
spent
more
time
studying
this
beer
than
any
other
i
judge
local
pubs
on
how
well
they
draw
the
pint
and
spent
two
days
in
dublin
comparing
the
pint
at
the
guinness
brewery
to
its
competitors
this
is
the
only
beer
i
know
that
can
be
a
3
due
primarily
to
disappointment
at
one
establishment
and
the
perfect
5
at
another
find
the
best
pub
measured
solely
in
terms
of
how
well
they
pour
the
pint
and
never
leave
not
a
big
guiness
fan
anyway
the
bottle
looks
cool
the
beer
is
predictable
rather
have
one
on
tap
if
it
is
the
only
good
beer
on
but
if
someone
had
these
in
their
fridge
or
budi
take
the
guiness
the
flavor
may
vary
slightly
from
tap
to
tap
but
guinness
is
pretty
much
equal
to
all
the
big
name
stouts
a
classic
overall
a
very
good
session
brew
some
places
do
serve
it
ice
cold
and
knocks
off
the
flavor
a
bit
but
an
good
brew
nonetheless
i
enjoyed
guinness
draught
from
the
bottle
sure
you
miss
the
show
in
the
glass
that
you
get
from
the
tap
or
the
can
but
it
has
that
unmistakable
guinness
taste
i
guess
messing
with
tradition
is
a
problem
for
some
but
not
me
i
liked
the
convenience
of
it
while
i
will
opt
for
the
draft
or
can
first
this
version
is
fine
this
beer
is
all
in
the
head
although
it
looks
like
guinness
and
does
taste
like
guinness
it
is
really
just
above
ok
i
like
to
have
one
once
in
while
when
i
am
unable
to
get
to
a
pub
it
serves
the
cravings
i
noticed
lately
that
is
too
cold
out
of
the
can
and
you
really
dont
get
the
flavor
or
bitterness
of
the
original
still
enjoyable
bleach
the
can
was
a
good
idea
and
was
a
decent
substitute
for
the
pub
pour
if
you
were
absolutely
jonesing
for
a
guinness
the
bottle
is
just
a
abomination
to
get
it
to
work
all
the
beer
flavor
was
sacrificed
leaving
a
pallid
artificial
tasting
black
alcoholic
liquid
guinness
has
gone
too
far
this
time
in
an
attempt
to
garner
even
more
of
the
market
it
is
giving
its
flagship
beer
a
black
eye
part
of
the
beauty
of
a
pint
of
guinness
is
in
the
pour
the
cascade
and
that
fact
that
youre
in
a
pub
now
with
this
bottle
shit
you
can
sit
on
the
couch
in
your
your
underwear
drinking
guinness
as
you
would
a
bud
light
shame
on
them
ive
never
felt
that
this
comes
close
to
the
draft
experience
the
beer
always
ends
up
almost
completely
flat
tastewise
its
got
the
nice
roasted
flavor
with
a
slight
sourness
but
the
creaminess
is
also
lacking
in
the
can
guinness
why
are
you
wasting
my
time
with
this
gimmicky
crap
oh
yeah
because
there
are
far
more
idiots
who
drink
beer
than
there
are
true
beer
lovers
and
you
want
to
tap
into
that
market
sellout
i
say
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
the
first
stout
i
ever
tried
and
i
am
still
in
love
with
the
style
there
is
just
something
about
watching
the
smooth
cascade
after
the
beer
is
poured
smooth
mouthfeel
and
all
the
way
down
too
a
definite
session
beer
there
is
nothing
more
drinkable
than
guinness
roasted
coffee
with
almond
flavours
and
a
two
inch
thick
head
that
stays
right
till
the
end
mmm
mmmm
beautiful
in
its
appearance
and
a
welcoming
texture
on
the
tongue
smokeyburnt
like
essense
smells
like
a
bouquet
of
flowers
and
hops
choice
guinness
on
tap
rules
not
my
first
choice
in
stouts
a
good
fall
back
since
its
available
most
everywhere
if
nothing
else
youve
got
to
credit
this
beer
as
one
of
the
great
firststeps
for
a
lot
of
people
looking
to
expand
their
beerdrinking
horizons
beyond
the
basic
megabrew
lagers
mild
enough
so
that
it
does
not
scare
them
off
not
my
favorite
irish
dry
stout
but
a
pint
of
guinness
is
always
like
meeting
an
old
friend
ok
guinness
draught
is
not
my
favorite
but
here
is
why
it
got
the
score
that
it
did
appearance
it
got
a
2
because
you
cant
see
it
this
is
made
spacifically
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
which
is
shrink
wrapped
so
you
can
not
see
the
beer
at
all
the
smell
and
tast
are
good
for
the
style
but
this
draught
stuff
is
just
too
thin
by
beer
rep
said
they
poured
it
out
into
glasses
to
test
it
and
it
came
out
flat
so
drink
it
out
of
the
bottle
or
not
at
all
a
beautiful
beer
to
look
at
and
nice
to
drink
too
plus
of
course
the
added
benefit
of
being
the
better
half
of
the
best
looking
drink
of
all
the
black
and
tan
one
word
for
this
brew
thin
this
is
the
beer
for
fools
that
want
you
to
know
i
drink
an
import
im
sophisticated
ill
buy
my
6er
of
extra
for
7
you
buy
you
4pk
of
draught
for
8
notes
what
can
i
say
its
not
the
most
remarkable
stout
that
ive
ever
had
its
not
very
exciting
compared
to
its
siblings
yes
even
on
tap
in
ireland
apart
from
guinness
the
tap
version
this
is
guinness
top
selling
beer
and
the
most
consistent
as
its
all
too
easy
these
days
to
get
an
inconsistent
poured
pint
of
guinness
personally
i
enjoy
and
appreciate
the
extra
stout
and
foreign
extra
stout
10
times
more
but
youll
find
me
slumming
it
on
occasion
a
mediocre
beer
bland
stout
no
sweetness
or
bitterness
to
it
at
all
kinda
had
a
soapy
taste
to
it
not
a
bad
effort
from
porterhouse
but
not
quite
up
to
the
standard
set
by
their
oyster
stout
that
i
tried
previously
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
bitterness
was
a
little
overpowering
but
it
was
enjoyable
at
least
this
was
an
extreme
stout
wouldnt
really
call
it
tasty
but
definitely
rich
and
rugged
a
nice
exercise
but
wouldnt
drink
two
of
these
in

around
pretty

spot
on

are
just
a

here
in

actually
not

potentially
an

i
really
like
the
overall
character
of
this
beer
but
also
like
the
unique

cap
ah
but
its
the
beers
flavor
and
feel
the
makes
this
one
a
keeper
i
hope
to
see
this
one
around
on
a
regular
basis
overall
i
am
not
sure
how
i
got
a
mildly
infected
bottle
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
same
it
could
be
the
bottle
was
old
marked
down
from
5
bucks
to
3
50
or
the
kick
as
ring
bottle
opener
why
cant
more
beers
have
this
regardless
i
still
enjoyed
it
immensely
im
very
excited
to
try
this
newcomer
to
my
local
store
straight
from
ireland
wrasslers
pours
a
solid
black
letting
only
a
faint
amount
of
light
through
its
tan
bubbly
head
rises
to
about
12
initially
but
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
sliver
theres
not
much
lacing
going
on
here
either
the
aroma
is
pretty
promising
and
telling
of
the
overall
worth
of
the
beverage
im
picking
up
a
lot
of
bittersweet
molasses
and
unsweetened
chocolate
maybe
a
little
vanilla
it
seems
pretty
straight
forward
and
the
taste
is
as
well
theres
the
aforementioned
aspects
along
with
an
almost
overbearing
sharp
bitterness
that
cuts
through
fortunately
i
like
bitter
flavors
very
much
but
this
could
put
some
people
off
i
also
dont
think
its
the
best
thing
for
the
style
it
still
is
pretty
smooth
light
and
drinkable
though
not
bad
at
all
but
give
me
a
brooklyn
or
sly
fox
dry
stout
instead
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
irish
style
dry
stout
o
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
beer
i
could
easily
drink
through
an
entire
session
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
low
abv
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
relatively
low

d
a
great
beer
to
nurse
and
savor
especially
in
cooler
weather
it
would
be
hard
to
tip
back
multiple
of
these
full

a

is

but
im
guessing
it
involves
importing
since
i
have
not
seen
this
many

solid

of
this
style
would
drink
it
all

overall
a
really
good
stout
and
at
only
5
one
that
can
be
sipped
on
through
the
evening
overall
a
really
solid
brew
from
porterhouse
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
macro
stuff
and
a
nice
and
hefty
take
on
the
style
do
tasty
stout

used

be

these
pop
top
brewers
are
challenging
my
senses
i
hope
to
continue
the
challenges
found
within
this
beer
drinkability
at
4
a
bottle
it
gave
me
my
moneys
worth
compared
to
the
big
three
it
is
noticeable
and
exceptional
very
decent
stuff
a
much
better
example
of
an
irish
stout
than
guiness
the
biggest
knock
on
this
fine
tasting
beer
is
its
cost
still
glad
to
have
learned
of
this
brewer
and
to
have
tasted
this
stout
ill
keep
tis
in
mind
for
st
pattys
day
d
drinkable
but
im
tried
of
it
by
the
end
of
this
small
glass
only
recommended
if
you
really
like
stout
ive
had
this
on
nitro
and
its
much
better
stay
away
from
the
bottle
version
d
drinkability
is
decent
dry
as
per
style
making
for
a
good
pub
style
beer
with
a
modest
5
7abv
d
one
the
bitter
hop
taste
ruins
the
great
start
of
the
flavor
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
with
a
nice
dark
black
opaque
coloring
the
head
is
very
thin
and
a
dark
shade
of
brown
the
head
actually
dissipates
before
i
make
it
from
my
bar
to
the
couch
the
first
smell
i
get
is
a
blend
of
coffee
grounds
and
a
sweet
fruity
smell
plum
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
coffee
flavor
to
go
along
with
the
aroma
there
is
also
an
earthy
undertone
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
bitter
bite
to
the
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
also
has
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
along
with
the
coffee
again
the
beer
is
actually
smooth
and
light
for
a
stout
with
a
very
dry
finish
the
bitterness
sits
in
mouth
for
bit
after
swallow
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
look
forward
to
trudging
my
way
through
dublin
at
some
point
to
try
it
from
the
source
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
pull
tab
bottle
first
time
i
have
had
that
pours
promising
black
with
a
little
white
head
promising
aromas
of
chocolate
and
lactose
the
taste
does
not
keep
up
as
very
dry
and
plain
the
looks
turn
into
a
light
reddish
colour
even
the
aroma
dissipitates
not
too
drinkable
dr
make
the
flavours
stronger
and
ill
drink
it
i
poured
this
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degreees
the
beer
was
black
off
course
kinda
chocolate
colored
the
beer
did
pour
a
nice
big
head
that
was
dark
colored
th
beer
was
bitter
on
the
after
taste
and
left
me
with
a
dry
mouth
i
did
not
care
for
it
i
will
not
buy
again
appearance
is
ruddy
tawny
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
nos
is
woody
and
roasted
like
charred
oak
someone
said
cigarette
ashtray
which
i
thought
was
a
bit
extreme
but
i
can
kind
of
see
what
they
were
driving
at
palate
is
mediumlight
bodied
and
creamy
but
bitter
and
roasted
on
the
finish
charred
wood
is
the
dominant
characteristic
here
very
dry
simple
but
seemingly
consumer
friendly
a
basic
decent
drink
with
a
very
nice
bold
simple
black
coffee
long
lasting
finish
the
full
caressing
body
is
beautifully
balanced
with
the
tingle
of
tasty
sourness
complimenting
a
very
long
and
very
satisfying
almost
earthy
dryness
every
element
is
there
to
be
tasted
yet
they
merge
to
make
a
delicious
whole
ravishing
top
notch
grand
feckin
grand
d
the
beer
is
very
dry
and
the
sourness
does
not
improve
my
feelings
on
this
one
this
one
just
wasnt
for
me
drinkability
is
quite
high
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
easy
to
put
down
and
with
everything
going
on
in
this
beer
it
is
still
just
simply
enjoyable
clean
and
great
tasting
well
ill
be
a
son
of
a
gun
its
poifect
poured
with
a
huge
thick
foamy
frothy
light
brown
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
and
some
lace
color
is
basically
an
opaque
black
brown
basically
because
only
at
the
very
base
of
my
beer
glass
where
its
very
narrow
can
i
just
barely
see
thru
the
clear
garnet
colored
brew
the
aroma
is
a
very
well
balanced
and
pleasing
blend
of
roasted
barley
malt
coffee
cocoa
pipe
tobacco
dark
worn
leather
flavors
like
the
aroma
plus
theres
a
bit
of
sweetness
against
the
dry
bitterness
of
the
other
ingredients
plus
theres
a
bit
of
tang
from
the
acid
of
the
carbonation
body
is
full
round
mouth
filling
and
yet
the
carbonation
is
exactly
where
it
should
be
to
complement
the
other
qualities
finish
is
like
flavor
and
slowly
fades
with
no
off
characteristics
at
all
session
for
sure
love
this
beer
saw
this
on
nitro
tap
at
townsends
in
hyde
park
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
huge
surging
action
when
it
was
ready
dark
blackish
color
like
charcoal
intensely
thick
creamy
head
atop
the
body
wonderful
ground
coffee
smell
really
had
the
roasted
barley
flavor
that
marks
the
makings
of
a
quality
irish
stout
super
thick
and
luscious
body
due
to
the
nitro
very
enjoyable
on
the
palate
easily
drinkable
and
of
course
it
had
the
low
abv
known
for
the
style
its
nice
to
find
a
new
stout
on
tap
every
once
in
a
while
as
an
alternative
to
the
guinness
beamish
and
murphys
this
stout
is
worth
looking
for
on
tap
at
your
local
pub
d
honestly
this
pretty
much
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
for
the
style
if
i
was
going
to
ireland
this
is
what
i
would
hope
to
find
everywhere
in
place
of
guinness
simply
an
amazing
stout
if
you
can
pick
this
up
do
it
i
know
i
will
in
the
future
note
obtained
in
2007
aged
three
years
d
a
very
well
made
and
drinkable
beer
good
beer
im
going
to
enjoy
this
all
the
way
through
mark
it
down
as
a
summer
stout
should
have
just
stuck
to
looking
this
beer
as
it
really
looks
great
as
for
how
it
tastes
mehhhh
very
nice
to
see
another
irish
beer
in
my
hometown
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
and
a
very
tightly
beaded
head
that
fades
to
a
swirly
cap
smells
roasty
and
creamy
and
fairly
mellow
there
are
some
light
hops
underneath
and
a
touch
of
light
sweetness
overall
the
impression
is
that
it
is
creamy
and
dry
with
an
edge
of
roasted
notes
the
taste
is
a
bit
roastier
and
less
creamy
with
coffee
bean
and
bitter
chocolate
notes
and
very
little
sweetness
very
dry
and
even
a
little
austere
quite
a
nice
beer
and
loads
more
flavor
than
a
certain
other
more
popular
stout
from
ireland
the
body
was
decent
a
little
fuller
than
average
for
the
style
the
drinkability
was
good
but
that
sharpness
and
metallic
taste
hurt
the
score
in
this
area
overall
a
decent
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
pours
a
great
deep
brown
just
about
black
color
with
excellent
head
and
good
lacing
throughout
deep
roasted
grain
scent
a
nice
heady
darkness
to
the
aroma
very
good
flavor
a
wonderful
tasting
stout
with
excellent
roasted
grains
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
mostly
just
a
great
dark
malt
flavor
went
down
very
smooth
sorry
there
got
carried
away
so
yes
chocolate
is
a
big
theme
in
wrasslers
both
on
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
though
i
am
not
sure
of
the
purpose
of
putting
beer
on
ones
nose
i
will
strive
to
discover
it
though
despite
the
big
smooth
chocolate
flavours
there
is
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
to
counteract
that
i
am
guessing
the
galena
hops
are
responsible
there
simply
put
this
is
so
much
better
than
the
beer
i
had
on
a
nitro
tap
and
i
am
very
glad
i
have
a
good
stock
in
the
cellar
hands
down
a
solid
irish
stout
maybe
just
a
bit
puckering
d
in
some
ways
this
is
a
one
dimensional
beer
the
strong
acrid
roast
character
is
the
dominant
and
at
times
only
flavor
in
the
beer
this
may
prevent
the
beer
from
achieving
a
great
level
of
complexity
but
it
is
pretty
much
standard
for
the
style
and
what
the
roast
character
lacks
in
depth
it
makes
up
for
in
intensity
the
roasted
charred
acrid
bitterness
of
this
beer
is
much
more
powerful
than
that
of
other
classic
examples
of
this
style
and
that
allows
for
a
more
enjoyable
drinking
experience
as
the
beer
pulls
a
surprising
level
of
nuance
out
of
this
monolithic
flavor
profile
there
are
some
hints
of
bread
caramel
and
even
smoke
but
these
are
largely
relegated
to
a
supporting
role
where
they
are
only
called
in
at
crucial
moments
to
balance
the
acid
roast
character
when
it
threatens
to
overwhelm
the
palate
overall
an
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
with
a
sharp
acidic
roast
character
and
an
intense
dryness
to
the
finish
that
whet
the
appetite
and
make
it
a
nice
aperitif
drinkability
is
good
but
this
definitely
isnt
my
favorite
for
this
style
overall
this
was
a
pretty
drinkable
irish
stout
however
it
doesnt
have
a
single
defining
characteristic
that
will
bring
me
back
still
its
worth
a
shot
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
pours
a
deep
warm
chocolaty
sable
with
a
nice
thick

tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
aroma
is
smoky
and
oily
with

the
best
drinking
beer
i
had
in

glad
to
see
some
porterhouse
stuff
in

area
poured
into
a
bass
pint
glass
a
deep

for

4x
stout
is
a
true
dry
irish
the
american
craft
scene
has
always
been
more
fascinated
with
russian
imperials
probably
because
dry
irish
stouts
tend
to
be
lower
abv
but
that
doesnt
mean
they
cant
be
packed
with
flavor
this
is
not
a
garish
hairband
rock
star
of
a
beer
and
it
does
not
squeal
out
a
25
minute
solo
like
kbs
does
it
is
a
balanced
5
abv
irish
stout
that
delivers
modest
fullbodied
and
satisfying
very
easy
drinking
with
a
refreshing
hop
finish
to
every
sip
overall
i
really
enjoyed
all
of
the
stouts
from
the
porterhouse
but
i
think
this
one
is
my
personal
favorite
its
less
sweet
and
has
more
bitter
and
roasted
character
than
the
plain
or
oyster
stout
this
stout
seemed
rather
strange
for
me
because
of
that
subtle
but
noticeable
soapy
feeling
also
quite
bittery
roasted
that
sometimes
seemed
too
much
d
this
has
more
heft
than
guinness
or
most
other
irish
dry
stouts
the
odd
cigarette
smoke
note
brings
out
a
european
bar
feel
but
does
hinder
the
drinkability
i
like
it
not
everyone
will
kind
of
a
bizarre
brew
taste
is
thick
creamy
dark
and
bakers
chocolate
touch
of
espresso
end
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
a
woody
aftertaste
pours
dark
black
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
smell
is
roasty
and
somewhat
mild
taste
is
rich
dark
roasted
malt
and
a
very
light
bit
of
coffee
in
the
flavor
slightly
bubbly
mouthfeel
but
this
was
pretty
good
overall
and
nicely
drinkable
d
cant
say
i
am
impressed
by
this
i
wonder
how
much
better
the
example
mr
jackson
was
because
this
was
not
an
example
of
dry
stout
that
i
would
ever
seek
out
pours
a
guinness
like
black
with
very
muddy
brown
highlights
eventually
recedes
to
a
thin
foam
and
then
to
nothingness
very
sparse
lacing
thick
aroma
of
dry
crea
coffee
oatmeal
flakes
chcolate
custard
an
orgy
for
the
nose
to
behold
the
sip
delivers
toffee
and
heavily
creamd
dark
chocolate
coffee
the
finish
is
a
dry
dried
oatmeal
feel
an
flavor
pretty
compex
beer
very
dry
palate
is
just
irresistable
i
just
want
to
drink
more
and
more
of
this
beer
coffee
flavors
in
the
first
sip
getting
into
more
nutty
chocolate
tobacco
and
waxy
carob
tastes
later
on
full
enough
with
a
malty
base
that
is
balanced
and
easy
drinking
light
for
a
stout
it
shared
some
characteristics
with
robust
porter
a
750
was
shared
but
this
is
something
i
could
return
to
easily
its
fairly
drinkable
i
would
probably
opt
for
their
plain
porter
or
even
the
oyster
if
i
had
to
choose
one
but
this
would
definitely
become
a
regular
or
possibly
irregular
staple
beer
if
i
lived
in
dublin
a
solid
brew
all
around
if
i
could
find
another
bottle
of
this
ill
definitely
be
down
for
another
trip
through
the
murk
nothing
incredibly
unique
very
subtle
in
fact
received
three
of
these
so
will
probably
drink
again
i
like
it
i
like
it
a
lot
a
rich
full
irish
stout
i
need
to
save
a
bottle
for
st
patricks
day
drinkable
but
the
750
is
enough
not
quite
a
session
beer
as
this
is
a
big
beer
for
this
style
so
dont
give
up
on
the
guinness
just
yet
i
enjoyed
the
porterhouses
other
stout
offerings
but
this
one
will
be
skipped
next
time
around
unless
someone
can
prove
me
wrong
as
fine
and
complex
an
irish
dry
stout
as
ive
ever
had
on
tap
at
the
parliament
street
porterhouse
in
dublins
temple
bar
nice
black
brew
with
a
solid
tan
head
all
manner
of
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
in
the
smell
which
play
well
against
a
restrained
maltiness
in
the
flavor
a
clean
lingering
pleasantly
bitter
aftertaste
i
would
not
classify
this
as
a
fullblown
session
beer
but
several
in
a
row
dont
wear
out
their
welcome
drinkability
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
at
all
from
a
bottle
that
i
got
through
the
michael
jacksons
rare
beer
club
i
was
immediately
impressed
by
the
pronounced
roasty
smell
and
richess
of
the
liquid
that
could
be
seen
in
the
pour
a
seriously
more
substantial
drink
than
any
irish
stout
i
have
had
before
rich
and
full
of
roasty
chocolatey
and
bitter
flavor
yet
sessionable
as
the
style
demands
definately
wouldnt
guess
7
abv
perfect
ive
been
to
dublin
several
times
but
never
to
the
porterhouse
i
will
make
it
a
must
stop
on
my
next
trip
one
of
the
only
beers
from
eire
i
will
miss
at
home
the
worst
of
the
stouts
i
tried
at
porterhouse
i
think
something
went
wrong
when
they
brewed
this
batch
aroma
is
alright
with
the
characteristic
roasted
chocolate
and
creaminess
to
it
but
the
finish
of
the
smell
imparted
this
weird
off
flavor
taste
also
began
good
but
by
the
middle
there
seemed
to
be
a
metallic
band
aid
flavor
this
had
potential
but
the
off
flavors
really
threw
me
off
and
although
i
finish
my
pint
it
took
some
effort
md
consistently
silky
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
almost
fullflavoured
against
a
medium
body
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
and
flavoursome
stout
much
more
satisfying
than
guiness
imo
just
like
other
dark
ales
by
porterhouse
i
think
it
should
be
served
warmer
than
cold
in
order
to
let
a
thicker
texture
to
be
released
but
its
a
solid
brew
all
the
same
recommended
tasted
well
strong
roast
malts
with
maybe
a
trace
of
blackcurrent
and
a
trace
of
coffee
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
that
grew
on
me
the
taste
was
just
as
strong
at
the
end
of
the
pint
as
in
the
first
tasting
quite
impressive
i
tried
quite
a
few
of
the
porterhouse
beers
during
my
stay
in
old
dublin
city
and
this
was
easily
the
best
of
the
bunch
by
far
their
thickest
creamiest
and
roastiest
of
their
porters
and
stouts
poured
on
nitro
a
cascading
black
with
a
thick
whipped
cream
like
tan
head
mild
aroma
of
nuts
and
chocolate
thick
creamy
slick
mouthfeel
roasty
and
malty
with
some
sweet
hints
of
nuts
and
chocolate
moreso
than
what
appears
in
the
nose
an
easy
drinker
and
one
that
would
session
quite
well
had
i
not
wanted
to
try
so
many
of
their
beers
i
would
have
drank
many
a
pint
of
this
fine
irish
stout
i
loved
this
porter
great
flavor
my
only
regret
upon
leaving
ireland
just
yesterday
is
that
i
wasnt
able
to
bring
some
home
with
me
this
very
dark
in
color
and
rich
tasting
beer
was
everything
i
hoped
for
i
highly
recommend
the
food
at
the
brewery
also
black
with
a
creamy
head
of
espresso
foam
aromas
are
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
caramel
and
a
bit
of
smoke
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
up
front
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
middle
and
slight
green
hops
and
smoke
in
the
finish
this
is
reminiscent
of
a
lighter
shakespeare
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
and
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
good
stout
from
this
brewpub
this
reminded
a
lot
of
guinness
but
with
so
much
more
flavor
i
would
easily
choose
this
over
all
those
other
irish
stouts
anyday
the
harshest
of
the
beers
ive
sampled
here
this
has
a
chocolatecoffee
characteristic
to
it
in
the
beginning
and
finishes
too
bitter
for
my
taste
it
doesnt
have
the
smooth
and
cremosisty
of
a
bitter
quite
nice
bitter
coffee
flavours
similiar
and
better
much
better
than
guiness
more
flavour
and
a
bit
of
spice
from
the
hops
quite
hoppy
nitrofied
which
i
didnt
particularly
like
but
there
still
managed
to
be
some
stouty
flavour
unlike
guinness
where
the
stouty
flavours
seem
to
be
all
but
lost
and
definitely
hoppier
than
guinness
in
a
city
ruled
by
guinness
a
better
stout
can
be
found
in
the
porterhouse
wrasslers
is
a
real
stout
unlike
the
nitroed
to
hell
guinness
on
tap
while
g
is
smooth
by
virtue
of
carbonation
and
lack
of
flavor
wrasslers
have
true
beer
flavor
and
feel
while
you
may
never
give
up
guinness
wrasslers
is
superior
if
the
porterhouse
wasnt
a
brewpub
with
limited
reach
guinness
would
be
in
trouble
compared
to
the
two
other
beers
i
tried
at
the
porterhouse
the
oyster
stout
and
hop
head
this
beer
was
very
bland
and
just
didnt
have
any
character
i
guess
thats
why
they
call
it
plain
im
a
dark
ale
fan
but
this
porter
just
wasnt
cutting
it
for
me
thankfully
the
other
two
beers
i
tried
were
incredible
a
perfect
stout
add
some
great
hops
and
you
get
a
great
beer
quite
a
surprise
somewhere
between
a
porter
and
an
irish
stout
but
its
body
sets
the
style
a
nice
stout
with
enough
depth
too
keep
it
interesting
and
not
too
heavy
to
drink
o
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
its
better
than
average
ogood
flavor
in
this
dry
stout
confusing
as
it
is
labelled
a
porter
o
after
first
pouring
and
smelling
this
brew
i
was
a
little
worried
that
i
was
in
for
a
disappointment
however
this
ended
up
being
a
very
easy
drinker
with
some
solid
taste
to
it
would
i
drink
another
if
it
was
offered
to
me
absolutely
would
i
make
it
a
point
to
actively
seek
this
out
and
purchase
probably
not
prost
lampertland
strong
smoky
aroma
has
notes
of
coffee
and
molasses
and
a
hint
of
unsweet
chocolate
pours
a
darkchocolate
brown
with
a
very
thick
light
tan
head
lets
a
peak
of
light
in
only
at
the
very
bottom
lipsmacking
flavor
has
caramel
molasses
coffee
and
unsweet
chocolate
notes
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
and
another
of
honey
sweetness
the
last
two
balance
each
other
nicely
body
seems
to
be
on
the
thin
side
and
fizz
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
overall
though
a
good
porter
not
really
plain
o
very
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
light
amount
of
bitterness
and
very
pleasant
roasty
flavors
and
smells
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
with
the
smoothness
o
while
this
beer
is
lightbodied
airy
and
easy
to
drink
it
doesnt
shy
away
from
packing
in
a
good
amount
of
roasted
malt
flavors
i
also
found
the
smoothness
and
creaminess
of
the
mouthfeel
to
be
rather
enjoyable
just
had
this
twice
on
tap
at
the
porterhouse
at
fraunces
tavern
in
new
york
city
broad
st
pearl
st
a
dark
black
porter
with
a
beautiful
inch
of
rich
head
formed
of
tiny
bubbles
nitro
smell
is
slightly
acidic
and
alcoholy
the
head
is
as
creamy
as
it
looks
and
the
dark
malty
notes
of
the
midbody
perfectly
balance
the
richness
of
the
porter
there
is
classic
british
hop
bittering
and
tasty
minerality
to
the
finish
in
short
this
is
the
best
porter
i
have
ever
had
if
you
are
in
lower
manhattan
you
should
definitely
try
this
amazing
beer
o
a
decent
beer
one
that
ive
found
to
be
much
beter
in
the
bottle
than
on
nitrotap
as
its
served
in
the
porterhouse

to

up
to
any
american
stout
or
porter
overall
a
classic
drinking
irish
beer
that
should
be
more
widespread
than
it
currently
is
these
guys
arent
extreme
for
the
sake
of
being
extreme
their
just
trying
to
be
flavorful
with
all
of
their
styles
in
a
mass
market
guinessmurphysbeamish
driven
culture
this
is
a
delightfully
approachable
porter
velvety
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
irish
dry
stout
overall
quite
drinkable
and
reasonably
tasty
stout
but
i
would
prefer
if
it
would
be
less
sweet
overall
not
bad
nice
creamy
flavors
dry
finish
nice
hops
but
roasty
overall
pretty
good
this
is
what
guinness
should
aspire
to
be
o
a
new
frontrunner
for
dry
irish
stout
too
bad
i
cant
get
this
everywhere
d
a
below
average
porter
that
really
disappointed
me
i
was
hoping
for
much
more
overall
i
know
they
were
attempting
to
make
a
classic
irish
dry
stout
but
thats
no
excuse
to
make
something
boring
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
thin
watery
and
close
to
the
macro
stuff
to
praise
it
grab
a
wrasslers
xxxx
the
name
in
plain
porter
speaks
for
itself
hops
galena
nugget
and
east
kent
golding
dr
a
flavourless
porter
that
isnt
worth
its
high
price
and
that
is
not
a
compliment
d
complex
and
unusual
there
is
a
nice
roast
quality
that
is
complimented
by
complex
caramel
malt
flavors
this
would
make
for
an
interesting
and
drinkable
beer
by
itself
but
the
spicy
notes
in
the
finish
really
put
it
over
the
top
and
make
it
something
special
overall
a
very
good
porter
recommended
easy
drinking
but
nothing
too
special
d
nice
sessionable
porter
md
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
rich
creamy
and
full
of
flavor
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
that
dominates
dublin
and
one
of
the
better
ones
at
that
overall
a
great
representation
of
an
irish
stout
i
like
the
wrasslers
4x
and
oyster
a
little
bit
better
than
this
one
but
its
still
an
amazing
brew
a
good
stout
that
scores
extra
points
with
me
for
uniqueness
one
topic
that
comes
up
now
again
is
how
to
clearly
separate
a
porter
from
a
stout
until
now
my
reference
beer
for
porter
was
sam
smiths
but
this
plain
porter
has
now
become
my
defining
example
for
the
style
i
had
this
on
draught
at
the
parliament
street
porterhouse
it
is
a
deep
brownblack
with
the
barest
ruby
glow
the
head
is
a
thick
medium
brown
and
quite
persistent
the
dark
malts
star
in
this
brew
and
keep
on
the
chocolate
part
of
the
spectrum
without
getting
the
roasted
grain
edge
it
is
an
easy
drink
that
has
the
complexity
to
maintain
your
interest
through
several
pints
a
very
drinkable
stout
full
of
rich
roasted
malt
flavour
that
said
id
have
preferred
if
it
was
served
a
bit
warmer
and
on
a
standard
tap
as
opposed
to
the
nitro
this
porterhouse
offering
came
out
dark
black
color
with
the
velvety
tan
head
roasted
aromas
with
coffee
standing
out
a
bit
more
theres
also
a
sweet
fruit
element
with
some
residual
sugar
taste
in
the
backdrop
flavor
repeats
itself
coffee
flavors
are
noticeable
and
somewhat
earthy
and
bitter
the
sweetness
is
chocolate
like
and
maybe
even
raisiny
a
smoky
dry
finish
body
is
not
quite
as
creamy
as
i
was
hoping
for
and
on
the
thinnish
side
a
solid
beer
with
some
flavor
to
it
but
the
flavors
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
personally
one
pint
and
i
was
ready
to
move
on
md
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
and
mediumbodied
it
retains
the
creamy
fizz
to
be
lively
enough
to
be
a
quaffable
beer
perhaps
it
could
be
more
flavoursome
if
it
was
served
4
centigrade
higher
otherwise
one
just
have
to
wait
and
chat
with
other
punters
before
going
for
a
satisfying
sip
dark
black
with
a
small
white
head
of
foam
that
lasted
and
left
nice
lacing
aromas
are
of
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
caramel
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
nice
roastiness
up
front
and
a
chocolate
and
coffee
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
creamy
as
well
but
this
stuff
is
eerily
similar
to
the
xxxx
stout
drinkability
remains
nice
doesnt
stand
up
to
their
oyster
though
it
is
quite
good
slightly
smoky
with
a
bitter
finish
a
nice
example
of
style
maybe
after
a
while
it
can
impaste
the
mouth
similiar
to
the
other
two
dark
beers
that
the
porter
house
makes
but
just
slightly
better
than
the
oyster
stout
creamy
which
i
didnt
like
nitrofied
nice
balance
between
the
lightly
bitter
roastyness
and
caramelly
flavours
some
hops
in
the
finish
pretty
tasty
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
uve
ever
has
thick
and
creamy
and
goes
down
easy
too
bottle
purchased
in
mullingar
ireland
cute
pull
ring
cap
head
quickly
disappeared
but
some
residual
lacing
definitely
a
taste
of
salt
not
as
bitter
as
some
stouts
but
not
as
much
oyster
as
i
expected
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
serving
type
bottle
a
deep
red
to
black
beer
in
color
with
a
light
head
i
feel
there
is
a
metallic
element
here
akin
to
iron
not
sure
how
the
oysters
affect
this
stout
but
you
can
tell
that
there
is
something
organic
and
nautical
going
on
creamy
mouthfeel
goes
down
smoothly
pairs
nicely
with
the
brewpubs
excellent
oysters
and
mussels
imo
not
as
mouthwatering
as
other
oyster
stouts
ive
tried
e
g
flying
dogs
pearl
necklace
but
the
subtlety
means
its
well
blended
and
thats
probably
good
for
most
palates
as
perhaps
too
much
of
an
oyster
taste
might
hurt
its
appeal
it
was
just
soso
and
even
so
was
the
best
part
of
my
breakfast
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
on
my
one
night
stay
in
dublin
i
essentially
only
left
the
airport
for
this
beer
i
think
i
envisioned
it
to
be
a
little
too
good
but
the
oyster
stout
is
still
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
and
i
love
stouts
creates
an
amazing
foamy
head
that
is
thick
and
cream
and
the
bodys
flavor
including
the
hints
of
real
oysters
is
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
truly
an
amazing

earthy

and

and
very
smooth
to

a
pleasantly
enjoyable
offering
this
was
an
okay
stout
and
i
think
i
might
choose
it
over
a
guinness
or
murphys
however
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
which
i
cannot
remember
except
that
it
was
a
little
pricy
given
the
amount
of
beer
overall
drinkability
a
very
pleasant
oyster
stout
i
first
read
about
oyster
stouts
in
a
book
by
roger
protz
learning
that
these
beers
very
rarely
contain
actual
oysters
today
most
modern
examples
contain
a
little
shell
material
or
just
carry
the
moniker
because
of
the
historical
association
this
one
is
apparently
legit
poured
from
the
bottle
into
an
english
pub
glass
this
is
a
dark
blackish
brown
brew
with
yellowish
highlights
and
around
two
fingers
of
bubbly
beige
head
aroma
evokes
caramel
light
molasses
maybe
a
small
measure
of
singed
barley
and
a
wispy
but
nevertheless
palpable
sea
salt
note
palate
is
expectedly
dry
and
rather
toasty
i
get
some
licorice
faint
aromatic
wintergreen
medicinal
iodine
chocolate
tootsie
roll
candy
light
roast
weak
coffee
and
white
pepper
spice
the
latter
element
lingers
through
into
the
roasted
dry
finish
which
also
features
some
earthy
hops
it
seems
that
other
reviewers
struggle
to
taste
the
oysters
but
i
do
get
a
different
flavor
here
that
makes
this
one
stand
apart
from
other
irish
dry
stouts
i
agree
that
the
beer
does
not
taste
overly
briny
but
certainly
this
is
not
a
guinness
body
is
chalky
and
dry
with
a
mild
metallic
tang
pervading
the
whole
proceedings
along
with
a
flinty
calcium
bite
cool
experience
if
not
an
acquired
taste
overall
too
reserved
for
an
oyster
stout
in
my
opinion
i
want
to
taste
the
ocean
like
having
a
mouthful
of
sea
water
obviously
this
can
be
done
well
if
one
was
to
balance
the
meaty
salts
with
nice
robust
candi
sugar
and
rich
grain
profile
also
worth
mentioning
this
tastes
like
the
same
recipe
used
to
brew
their
regular
stout
but
with
the
subtle
addition
of
oysters
it
also
reminds
me
of
guinness
boring
and
safe
overall
rather
bland
after
having
intense
truetostyle
oyster
stouts
similar
to
those
made
by
upright
brewing
and
others
this
just
really
pales
in
comparison
wont
be
buying
again
good
balance
and
some
nice
sweetness
on
top
of
the
traditionally
dark
flavours
without
being
a
stand
out
in
this
one
was
definitely
one
of
the
better
dry
stouts
i
have
tasted
and
was
particularly
good
for
an
oyster
stout
overall
i
seem
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
others
around
here
as
i
have
found
a
surprising
range
of
flavors
in
the
mix
overall
a
great
classicinstyle
oyster
stout
this
is
a
tough
one
i
will
rate
the
appearance
similar
to
the
other
porterhouse
beer
i
have
had
as
it
looks
very
much
the
same
nearly
black
almost
opaque
small
head
after
the
initial
pour
no
lacing
the
smell
is
okay
salty
almost
earthy
briny
a
tiny
bit
of
chocolate
and
mostly
a
cloying
and
alien
sweetness
perhaps
also
some
oxidized
essence
when
drinking
the
smooth
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
too
acidic
salty
and
most
of
all
too
sweet
even
though
i
am
inexperienced
in
oyster
stout
tasting
im
sure
theres
much
better
out
there
in
the
style
overall
this
beer
was
good
for
its
style
but
nothing
amazing
or
near
the
top
of
my
list
of
favorite
stouts
didnt
get
any
flavor
of
oyster
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
went
down
pretty
easy
but
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
o
a
very
drinkable
and
balanced
beer
the
smell
of
lager
like
qualities
threw
me
for
a
loop
and
reminded
me
of
a
schwarz
but
a
solid
dry
stout
non
the
less
this
is
mild
stout
perfect
for
introducing
neophytes
theres
a
good
blend
of
black
patent
malt
and
white
pepperlike
hop
the
body
is
richer
than
most
stouts
the
carbonation
is
also
high
theres
a
touch
bandaid
to
the
taste
the
swallow
has
excellent
balance
of
malt
and
bittering
hop
o
this
beer
is
completely
bipolar
the
appearance
and
smell
are
huge
thick
robust
then
the
taste
and
feel
are
thin
and
timid
rather
an
odd
combination
of
traits
carbonation
is
fairly
low
pretty
good
body
for
a
5
abv
irish
stout
the
feel
is
good
appropriately
fullbodied
but
not
a
huge
american
bruiser
nor
should
it
be
its
mostly
dry
but
might
lean
a
touch
gentler
than
some
theres
enough
smoothness
at
first
though
it
gets
a
little
tough
in
the
texture
toward
the
middle
its
a
very
nice
well
balanced
beer
i
dont
think
it
is
so
different
that
it
would
convert
your
average
industrial
stout
drinker
but
its
every
bit
as
good
i
like
the
little
guys
so
ill
get
it
again
need
to
get
back
to
dublin
some
day
so
i
can
try
this
fresh
overall
a
pretty
good
irish
style
dry
stout
good
roasty
flavors
and
a
nice
kick
from
the
oyster
enjoyed
on
march
17th
at
my
place
in
newtown
ct
this
irish
made
specialty
stout
seems
to
be
out
there
out
of
nowhere
this
saint
patricks
day
season
it
shows
a
semitransparent
dark
blackbrown
color
with
a
giant
thick
and
creamy
tan
head
and
very
good
sporadic
but
chunky
lacing
follows
i
pick
up
mild
wheatmalt
and
vague
charcoal
grass
in
the
nose
hit
but
its
a
bit
weak
definitely
not
bold
the
first
taste
brings
a
charcoal
flavor
with
oyster
shell
edges
and
floral
grass
hop
hints
i
also
pick
up
some
grapewine
ideas
theres
a
chalky
feel
on
the
surface
of
this
medium
light
bodied
stout
with
modest
carbonation
very
much
a
cask
ale
feel
not
bad
although
theres
a
very
slight
touch
of
soapiness
and
its
a
bit
thin
for
my
tastes
decent
flavor
overall
prost
lampertland
o
not
bad
but
not
very
exciting
o
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
this
is
the
first
oyster
stout
ive
tried
so
i
dont
know
how
this
does
in
the
style
i
did
enjoy
drinking
it
even
though
i
found
it
salty
ooyster
adds
complexity
and
nice
flavor
with
the
roasted
notes
pretty
solid
stout
overall
and
interesting
stout
with
a
twist
ill
admit
that
ive
never
had
an
oyster
before
which
is
probably
why
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
strange
minerallike
note
thats
present
in
this
beer
for
the
price
id
recommend
another
oyster
stout
if
possible
a
quite
interesting
twist
on
the
irish
dry
stout
trope
wherein
the
soft
dry
roasted
malt
mainstay
is
gently
nudged
by
some
mild
seaside
characteristics
enjoyable
surely
but
more
for
the
memory
of
eire
than
the
promise
of
a
current
pub
session
methinks
o
what
you
look
for
in
a
dry
stout
are
typical
stout
notes
among
a
soft
feel
and
great
drinkabilty
this
one
has
all
that
plus
a
bit
of
a
peculiar
feel
nice
as
my
first
oyster
stout
this
proves
that
i
cant
unilaterally
say
that
i
like
stouts
apologies
to
anyone
upset
if
im
not
rating
to
style
but
i
just
couldnt
finish
this
to
me
this
was
foul
weak
thin
and
devoid
of
merit
sooo
good
appearance
was
dark
and
rich
like
midnight
the
smell
was
decadent
with
robust
malt
roasted
notes
that
had
a
hint
of
mineral
trueness
taste
didnt
let
anyone
down
it
had
deep
rich
black
notes
of
chocolate
and
tobacco
with
a
slight
finish
of
a
fresh
briny
mineral
note
the
mouthfeel
was
solid
and
coated
the
pallet
well
overall
it
was
the
best
overall
an
impressive
beer
and
seemed
true
to
style
while
not
in
the
least
an
oyster
stout
afficianado
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
give
it
high
marks
slightly
on
the
hoppier
end
from
my
taste
buds
but
the
mineral
qualities
seemed
right
on
cue
for
this
style
will
buy
again
anytime
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
saltier
sort
of
beer
with
good
malt
and
hop
qualities
thanks
ireland
and
porterhouse
final
thoughts
a
little
disappointed
in
how
thin
and
watery
this
one
was
there
just
wasnt
much
to
taste
although
there
is
an
interesting
aftertaste
that
i
cant
define
would
i
drink
it
again
nah
o
a
well
balanced
stout
carb
is
on
the
high
side
so
i
would
have
this
with
a
rich
greasy
food
deep
fried
mars
bar
or
deep
fried
chicken
o
there
arent
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
oyster
stouts
on
the
market
this
one
is
on
par
with
the
few
that
ive
had
it
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
depth
and
malt
character
but
its
solid
enough
it
does
seem
that
it
would
make
a
great
pairing
with
some
oysters
overall
a
good
and
in
my
experience
unique
stout
3
75
recommended
unique
profile
flavor
is
interestingly
inky
definitely
different
i
like
it
very
smooth
feel
carbonation
is
low
and
seems
appropriate
for
the
style
interesting
brew
i
like
overall
an
ok
stout
sweet
and
dry
o
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
really
easy
to
drink
i
have
had
this
beer
numerous
times
though
this
is
my
first
time
reviewing
it
and
will
continue
to
get
this
beer
again
the
flavor
the
oysters
add
is
quite
interesting
i
love
the
very
interesting
opening
cap
kind
of
a
nifty
review
from

notes
poured
into
a
gulden

a
dark

and

toasted

dark

nice

malt
with
odd
but
interesting
mineral
start
malt
middle
and
dry
finish
somewhat
thin
bodied
interesting
and
different
worth
a
revisit
i
worry
about
the
first
guy
who
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
put
oysters
in
a
beer
guess
it
worked
out
though
im
sorry
but
its
not
much
of
an
irish
dry
stout
not
dry
at
all
the
oysters
give
it
some
flair
but
its
mostly
just
indescribable
flavors
as
the
label
would
suggest
sadly
the
weak
area
is
the
body
somewhat
less
than
medium
watery
almost
though
pretty
smooth
effervescence
is
on
the
light
side
but
appropriate
for
the
style
drying
aftertaste
is
an
unusual
mix
of
toast
and
whiskey
with
a
hint
of
cherry
and
juniper
i
like
it
if
the
body
were
fuller
i
would
rate
it
4s
across
the
board
a
truly
remarkable
beer
the
oyster
presense
is
not
fishy
but
a
bit
salty
like
a
true
oyster
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
oyster
so
much
that
a
non
oyster
eater
would
still
enjoy
the
beer
had
this
on
cast
which
makes
it
even
better
on
a
hot
day
the
briney
oyster
made
this
just
the
right
beer
the
cask
was
cold
for
most
casks
which
appeased
me
on
a
hot
day
the
stout
minus
the
oyster
is
also
excellent
in
fact
the
stout
minus
the
oyster
would
blow
a
guinness
away
because
it
is
not
nearly
as
offputting
bitter
and
had
great
malty
chocolate
coffee
put
this
on
your
todo
list
if
you
havent
already
enjoyable
curious
about
that
saltyish
taste
again
power
of
suggestion
exactly
what
the
oysters
impart
o
totally
surprised
by
my
first
oyster
stout
i
love
oysters
i
love
beer
i
never
ever
thought
that
they
would
go
well
together
outside
of
having
them
at
the
ithaca
brute
release
very
well
done
overall
i
cant
say
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
ok
i
dont
really
care
for
the
colalike
taste
or
the
tannic
bitterness
probably
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
overall
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
try
and
drink
but
it
will
leave
you
waiting
for
a
special
occasion
to
try
it
again
overall
not
bad
but
weird
glad
im
having
it
and
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
off
enough
that
its
not
something
i
think
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
or
would
want
to
still
worth
seeking
out
as
a
novelty
if
nothing
else
dark
dark
beer
with
a
beautiful
creamy
whipped
cream
nitro
head
i
cant
even
call
it
lacing
because
there
is
no
lace
just
a
sheet
of
foam
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
was
killed
by
the
nitro
i
get
a
bit
of
mild
roast
but
the
nitro
is
overwhelming
same
in
the
flavor
unfortunately
the
only
nitro
beer
i
have
been
super
impressed
with
is
old
raspy
this
beer
seems
to
be
taken
over
by
the
character
of
the
nitro
instead
of
the
character
of
the
ber
moutgfeel
is
the
customary
creamy
nitro
moutgfeel
for
me
nitro
is
not
for
the
beer
it
is
for
the
head
nice
beer
but
i
would
love
to
see
what
it
is
like
without
the
nitro
o
if
youre
at
all
interested
in
oyster
stouts
i
highly
recommend
this
one
high
in
drinkability
3
5
d
i
think
this
is
only
my
second
oyster
beer
and
first
one
that
didnt
taste
like
ass
quite
interesting
and
the
oysters
breathed
life
into
a
style
that
is
pretty
much
dead
to
me
similar
color
and
alcohol
level
to
their
plain
porter
this
is
a
deep
ruby
color
almost
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
forming
thick
and
leaving
behind
dwindledscattered
lacing
aroma
has
a
salty
brine
to
the
herbal
mint
dark
chocolate
notes
between
the
dark
roasts
and
various
hop
varieties
flavor
is
muted
with
dark
bitter
chocolate
notes
and
a
sea
salt
finish
that
actually
works
with
a
soft
calcium
ion
infused
water
source
the
only
beer
thats
good
for
your
bones
any
oyster
stout
the
most
well
blended
version
of
any
of
their
beers
ive
had
im
really
interested
why
this
drinks
so
well
this
will
kill
an
irishmen
especially
at
proper
temp
and
serving
technique
of
course
that
would
be
cask
fine
drinking
beer
fine
easy
to
gulp
texture
with
ample
flavor
abound
finishes
lightly
dry
but
not
bittering
hop
pellet
dry
cohesive
flavors
and
excellent
beverage
marry
in
my
glass
im
ready
for
a
whole
four
pack
how
expensive
were
these
freakin
beers
o
another
fantastic
stout
with
an
interesting
tangy
quality
delicious
had
ontap
at
the
fountainhead
in
chicago
this
came
out
pitchblack
with
two
fingers
of
bright
white
head
the
smell
is
very
brinyi
guess
thats
what
i
wanted
when
i
ordered
this
the
malt
palate
is
roasted
malts
bittersweet
chocolate
and
charred
coffeea
really
welldone
irish
dry
stout
but
then
hey
theres
some
tangy
saltbrine
there
you
will
either
like
it
or
find
this
absolutely
repulsive
but
i
was
on
the
former
side
the
perfectly
smooth
creamy
and
full
mouthfeel
helped
a
lot
overall
gross
i
did
not
finish
my
fourth
drink
of
a
12oz
beer
down
the
drain
it
went
it
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
tiny
head
aroma
is
herbal
and
roasty
at
the
same
time
with
some
deep
malts
and
coffee
composing
the
roasts
the
taste
is
fairly
unique
with
the
oysters
surely
adding
some
salty
zing
to
the
beers
full
roasted
flavor
its
just
a
very
well
composed
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
it
goes
on
with
just
the
right
amount
of
body
at
first
and
leaves
the
mouth
perfectly
dry
after
a
sip
overall
this
is
a
great
and
fairly
unique
beer
id
like
to
try
some
more
oyster
stouts
i
had
no
idea
that
oyster
stout
was
a
thing
a
friend
clued
me
in
when
he
brought
one
back
from
a
maine
brewery
i
purchased
this
irish
one
from
a
store
in
st
louis
searching
for
it
today
i
found
a
whole
mess
of
them
i
do
love
irish
dry
stouts
and
id
be
interested
to
pursue
more
oyster
stouts
a
great
brew
11
2
oz
bottle
with
a
cool
pull
ring
lid
i
could
not
find
a
freshness
date
of
any
kind
label
was
too
modern
and
loud
for
my
taste
after
a
vigorous
poor
into
a
hennepin
glass
the
bear
foamed
into
a
nice
but
too
fluffy
2
5
finger
head
the
head
held
its
ground
well
and
yielded
a
nice
lace
but
was
not
the
creamy
dense
head
i
expected
the
scent
was
earthy
without
any
sea
which
i
expected
some
overcooked
coffee
in
the
nose
and
a
hint
of
toffee
no
chocolate
that
i
really
hoped
for
the
appearance
was
nice
and
dark
but
not
black
and
lacking
that
deep
glow
i
love
in
a
good
stout
the
taste
was
dominated
by
dark
overcooked
coffee
but
in
a
nice
down
home
way
after
it
warmed
a
bit
there
was
a
slight
sweetness
like
dried
fruit
plumb
and
bitter
grapes
again
just
a
hint
sweet
there
was
a
bit
of
low
tide
in
the
background
but
not
the
sea
flavor
i
was
hoping
for
in
my
first
taste
of
an
oyster
stout
the
dram
was
a
bit
warming
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
more
like
a
warm
loaf
of
pumpernickel
bread
in
all
a
decent
stout
not
much
different
than
the
masses
out
there
definitely
more
expensive
than
most
the
best
part
was
the
cap
but
that
doesnt
last
long
overall
im
enjoying
this
example
of
the
style
not
one
of
the
best
in
the
bunch
but
a
very
well
puttogether
beer
great
texturemouthfeel
could
use
more
complexity
in
the
dark
grain
flavors
along
with
improved
head
formationretention
this
beer
is
worth
drinking
for
the
experience
of
the
texture
besides
that
its
a
descent
stout
o
an
interesting
brew
what
the
oysters
bring
to
the
table
is
less
about
oyster
flavor
and
more
about
elevating
salt
content
while
still
keeping
it
in
check
the
added
salt
adds
an
interesting
dimension
to
some
familiar
flavors
but
the
net
effect
is
more
novel
than
exceptional
o
the
addition
of
oysters
makes
this
beer
unique
and
having
it
on
nitro
tap
definitely
improves
the
appearance
and
drinkability
o
an
interesting
beer
my
first
oyster
stout
this
one
was
actually
brought
back
from
across
the
seas
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
interesting
worthy
as
a
tasting
or
session
beer
if
you
can
afford
more
than
one
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
o
certainly
different
and
i
commend
them
for
it
but
its
not
something
id
pick
up
again
this
one
is
a
novelty
for
me
o
a
nice
stout
overall
highly
drinkable
not
heavy
in
the
least
salty
finish
makes
you
want
another
drink
which
in
the
end
really
doesnt
help
to
cure
the
overall
feeling
of
thirst
but
i
did
really
enjoy
it
overall
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
also
find
it
difficult
to
remember
i
bought
it
due
to
the
cool
pull
tab
bottle
cap
but
doubt
that
i
would
pick
it
up
again
as
i
found
it
slightly
boring
and
underwhelming
t
i
was
a
little
ok
a
lot
skeptical
about
this
one
but
its
actually
really
good
a
bit
of
brine
at
first
followed
by
some
roasted
malt
and
day
old
coffee
a
slight
bit
of
saltiness
on
the
finish
as
well
but
the
oysters
are
very
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
all
the
elements
work
together
pretty
well
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
irish
dry
stout
m
d
creamy
dry
correct
level
of
co2
t
dark
chocolate
up
front
smooth
and
mild
with
a
faint
hint
of
yeast
fruitiness
and
smoke
in
the
middle
a
moderate
but
biting
roastiness
emerges
along
with
a
bit
of
a
carbonic
bite
due
higher
than
average
carbonation
for
the
style
and
significant
acidity
hints
at
slightly
sweet
sea
breeze
and
minerals
in
the
middle
which
gives
a
subtle
complexity
to
the
roast
character
faint

hops
and
stays
on
the
bitter
side
throughout
finishes
slightly
acidic
and
lightly
earthy
with
a
lingering
coffee
charcoal
woody
bitterness
light
and
drinkable
with
enough
subtle
interest
to
have
again
this
could
be
a
session
beer
for
me
as
i
would
love
to
sip
this
down
as
i
was
playing
darts
in
a
pub
nice
bitterness
light
carbonation
and
low
abv
make
this
highly
quaffable
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
and
suggest
trying
it
if
you
can
find
it
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
but
the
flavors
just
werent
there
for
me
to
justify
the
price
point
glad
i
tried
it
out
onot
bad
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
oyster
flavors
or
something
since
this
was
my
first
oyster
stout
and
i
didnt
know
what
to
be
ready
to
taste
i
guess
this
has
oysters
added
in
the
brewing
process
i
have
no
clue
what
exactly
they
contribute
to
the
flavor
as
ive
never
eaten
oysters
before
but
i
dont
find
it
particularly
pleasing
to
be
honest
it
isnt
bad
just
dull
and
odd
very
dark
amber
in
color
thick

good

mildy
fresh

dry

underneath
on
the
aftertaste
leaving
a
gentle
dry
bitterness
full
body
light
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
dry
but
coating
some
flavors
in
the
nutty
register
but
also
a
good
dose
of
roasting
astringency
some
mineral
hints
perhaps
from
the
oysters
o
this
is
just
like
a
regular
irish
stout
a
decent
one
with
a
slightly
different
twist
lovely
brew
whether
porter
or
stout
tasty
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
tasty
dry
stout
directly
from
the
source
glad
to
see
it
here
in
ny
o
an
interesting
irish
stout
this
would
go
really
well
is
meat
or
raw
oysters
medium
to
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
doesnt
want
to
be
just
sipped
on
the
body
is
thick
and
a
somewhat
sticky
but
not
nearly
as
dense
as
some
stouts
the
carbonation
is
just
strong
enough
to
give
this
beer
a
creamy
texture
this
stout
is
delicious
rich
creamy
head
smooth
taste
dark
bodied
there
is
an
actual
feeling
of
sea
breeze
or
something
indefinable
but
nice
about
the
scent
i
am
certainly
going
to
order
myself
more
of
this
one
overall
a
decent
stout
one
id
recommend
black
sort
of
ruby
edged
slightly
darker
than
cola
short
tight
head
settles
to
a
whisp
salty
briny
nose
most
likely
through
the
power
of
suggestion
a
light
whiff
of
medicinal
coffee
not
a
ton
of
flavor
up
front
initially
some
bittering
comes
through
soon
after
and
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
palate
as
it
warms
some
bitter
bakers
chocolate
comes
through
highlight
here
is
the
mouthfeel
crisp
carbonation
paired
with
a
dry
finish
and
mineral
aftertaste
makes
this
like
a
delicious
alcoholic
tonic
water
very
drinkable
begs
to
be
sipped
the
abv
is
well
hidden
wish
i
had
some
oysters
to
pair
it
with
a
style
that
has
piqued
my
interest
o
i
quite
like
this
beer
however
the
novelty
aspect
of
the
oysters
is
lost
on
me
i
just
cant
taste
a
perceptible
difference
that
could
not
be
achieved
by
other
means
o
porterhouse
oyster
stout
aint
half
bad
for
an
oyster
stout
i
love
oysters
but
for
some
reason
ive
never
found
an
oyster
stout
ive
really
fallen
for
and
that
goes
for
this
one
maybe
its
a
gimmick
ill
just
never
get
but
in
the
mean
time
i
wouldnt
pass
one
of
these
up
if
offered
the
tan
head
is
not
too
shy
to
flaunt
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
brown
edges
though
pretty
much
black
roasted
nose
some
minty
hops
and
a
faint
hint
of
fresh
ocean
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
refreshing
quality
underneath
that
creamy
body
bit
of
charcoal
but
more
sweetness
of
mild
molasses
and
dark
roasted
coffee
hints
of
salt
and
earth
on
the
palate
hops
have
a
bite
with
a
bit
of
wild
herb
flavor
light
touch
of
fruit
and
alcohol
in
the
drying
roasty
finish
very
much
a
porter
and
with
an
extra
level
of
complexity
from
the
use
of
oysters
which
ends
up
working
quite
well
overall
did
not
get
the
oyster
flavor
out
of
this
beer
at
all
still
a
good
dry
irish
stout
better
than
guiness
anyways
nothing
real
flashy
but
an
easy
drinker
definitely
something
id
drink
another
of
but
mostly
because
its
easy
to
drink
not
for
the
lacking
robustness
of
flavors
or
complexity
yummm
poured
with
lovely
foamy
frothy
fluffy
tan
head
with
lots
of
lace
color
is
an
opaque
pitch
black
aroma
was
interesting
it
did
have
something
odd
but
maybe
i
sucumbed
to
some
bs
other
than
that
also
roasty
malty
and
clean
flavor
was
neat
too
almost
sweet
but
not
quite
very
well
done
balance
there
body
is
very
good
and
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
medium
length
i
can
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
o
this
stout
needs
oyster
and
a
richer
flavor
it
has
potential
but
didnt
do
it
for
me
in
the
way
of
oyster
stout
considering
its
brewed
with
oysters
i
was
a
little
fearful
but
really
anticipated
some
sort
of
shellfish
quality
theres
almost
none
of
that
here
beyond
an
unwanted
musky
mildew
aroma
i
imagine
porterhouse
was
going
for
a
certain
texture
here
or
even
trying
to
capitalize
off
of
the
novelty
but
they
really
missed
on
all
counts
for
something
so
intriguing
its
pretty
boring
overall
this
was
a
hell
of
a
disappointment
paid
20
for
a
four
pack
but
this
beer
isnt
worth
4
for
the
four
pack
avoid
this
turkey
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
deep
black
color
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
smell
something
like
a
guinness
with
the
roasted
malts
and
such
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
nice
sting
to
it
not
sure
how
else
to
explain
it
its
roasted
and
has
this
strange
bite
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
oily
but
not
heavy
overall
its
a
pretty
interesting
stout
and
would
totally
drink
it
again
o
its
an
alright
dry
stout
but
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
seem
to
be
on
the
thinner
side
not
worth
its
fairly
high
singlebottle
price
tag
o
i
kind
of
want
to
taste
this
on
a
regular
tap
and
not
just
nitro
to
do
a
comparison
sadly
they
only
have
it
on
nitro
its
good
though
a
lot
more
flavor
as
it
warms
up
id
keep
drinking
it
the
beer
is
smooth
has
a
distinct
stout
flavor
to
it
but
thats
about
it
i
actually
looked
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
all
day
only
to
be
let
down
at
my
first
sip
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
that
tastes
like
oysters
this
isnt
it
o
this
is
a
solid
stout
and
would
be
good
for
those
looking
for
one
to
break
in
with
contrary
to
the
perception
it
does
not
taste
like
oysters
this
beer
tastes
pretty
normal
considering
the
ingredients
of
oyster
shells
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
unique
flavor
profile
than
what
i
experienced
this
beer
as
exotic
as
my
friends
might
think
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
give
someone
so
they
can
feel
adventurous
and
say
that
they
had
beer
made
with
oysters
try
one
for
yourself
its
an
easy
brew
to
drink
and
would
probably
go
will
with
many
different
foods
taste
surprisingly
shows
very
little
sweetness
mostly
a
dry
powdery
roast
flavor
not
much
briny
oyster
contributions
here
very
lightbodied
almost
watery
this
is
not
as
good
as
the
harpoon
100
barrel
oyster
stout
i
thought
the
saltysweet
aspect
was
the
best
part
of
an
oyster
stout
this
one
is
just
kind
of
a
bland
irish
dry
stout
delicate
and
mild
i
feel
like
my
review
is
bashing
it
it
does
have
some
redeeming
qualities
i
just
cant
think
of
what
right
now
fun
to
try
but
not
recommended
overall
its
a
bit
overblown
on
the
mellowside
for
an
everyday
beer
if
you
know
what
i
mean
tho
it
was
certainly
overall
enjoyable
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
hold
its
head
very
well
this
is
a
pretty
yummy
beer
im
not
sure
that
id
call
it
an
irish
dry
stout
but
im
not
sure
that
porterhouse
would
call
it
such
either
a
very
nice
and
very
enjoyable
beer
this
is
the
2nd
oyster
stout
ive
every
tried
other
than
yards
love
stout
this
is
quite
similar
and
this
style
is
truly
beginning
to
grow
on
me
unfortunately
nothing
warrenting
the
price
tag
but
thanks
to
beerfm
andy
for
satisfying
the
dtrains
curiosity
overall
this
a
total
gimmick
beer
i
doubt
they
even
brew
it
with
oysters
i
will
never
buy
this
again
overall
a
nice
little
stout
from
porterhouse
this
one
is
very
close
to
a
regular
irish
dry
but
the
addition
of
oysters
gives
it
a
distinct
and
unique
edge
im
really
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
weird
taste
not
unbearably
horrible
but
not
worthy
for
me
to
want
to
try
another
one
the
body
feel
falls
short
of
what
a
stout
should
feel
like
d
a
nice
oyster
stout
from
porterhouse
that
i
would
put
on
a
par
with
marstons
version
of
an
oyster
stout
o
if
you
like
dry
stouts
with
flavor
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
definitely
a
unique
flavor
profile
but
its
not
over
powering
o
this
is
the
first
oyster
stout
ive
had
in
a
long
time
and
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
it
just
a
really
nice
dry
stout
but
with
a
subtle
twist
not
my
favorite
but
i
think
ill
try
and
get
my
hands
on
a
few
more
oyster
stouts
to
compare
it
to
i
like
this
beer
tastes
great
not
really
a
stout
though
o
very
good
flavor
leaves
me
wanting
another
overall
its
an
ok
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
again
but
i
would
recommend
to
try
if
youve
never
had
d
this
was
a
pretty
cool
little
beer
it
wasnt
the
freshest
but
it
held
up
fine
it
has
me
interested
in
oyster
stouts
even
more
id
like
to
see
how
this
stacks
up
against
others
it
is
smooth
and
refreshing
and
has
a
nicely
balanced
complex
taste
that
is
a
nice
change
for
a
stout
light
for
a
stout
but
very
drinkable
on
the
takehome
scale
i
would
buy
one
if
i
was
doing
a
stout
tasting
and
had
oysters
but
probably
not
otherwise
d
average
drinkability
nothing
distinct
about
this
that
would
make
me
want
to
return
to
it
but
not
having
a
hard
time
getting
it
down
either
mouthfeel
drinkabilty
definitely
a
very
smooth
stout
not
really
sour
but
definitely
funky
i
thought
this
was
quite
delicious
and
i
downed
my
fill
in
no
time
at
all
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
youve
never
had
the
classic
pairing
of
stout
oysters
then
go
eat
that
if
you
cant
then
your
next
best
option
is
to
find
an
oyster
stout
this
would
be
a
good
choice
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
an
oyster
stout
but
the
flavor
was
intriguing
not
too
dark
and
not
too
light
please
bear
with
me
as
this
is
my
1st
review
the
next
bottle
of
this
i
open
will
be
with
an
oyster
poboy
drink
is
decent
fairly
sessionable
no
booze
a
bit
earthier
and
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
not
bad
and
that
strange
gritty
and
light
briny
taste
that
flashes
oysters
in
the
mind
an
interesting
beer
to
sample
taste
starts
out
with
roasted
malt
at
the
forefront
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
chalky
presence
carbonation
is
high
and
kind
of
kills
it
light
nuttiness
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
isnt
enough
to
save
this
beer
from
being
fairly
average
not
picking
up
any
oyster
presence
except
for
a
little
saltiness
body
is
thin
overall
good
flavor
would
make
a
nice
session
brew
this
beer
is
a
dark
colored
liquid
not
quite
black
with
a
reddish
hue
the
smell
is
moderately
smoky
with
a
pleasant
grainy
flavor
the
taste
is
incredibly
dry
with
a
little
chalky
flavor
the
beer
does
have
a
little
roasted
malt
flavor
and
some
nut
qualities
it
finishes
dry
as
well
soft
mouthfeel
a
little
lighter
than
expected
for
a
stout
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
really
outstanding
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
beautiful
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
smallish
off
white
head
hung
in
there
for
a
while
before
gravity
got
the
best
of
it
smell
is
lackluster
hints
of
minerals
faint
roasted
malts
lightly
sweet
caramel
or
dark
sugars
smells
like
a
sugary
guinness
honestly
taste
is
a
sweet
slightly
roasty
slightly
mineraly
affair
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
level
of
carbonation
and
body
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
but
lacking
much
roasty
character
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
too
bad
that
11
2
ounces
cost
me
3
75
as
such
while
i
find
it
quite
drinkable
i
doubt
i
actually
will
be
drinking
very
much
of
this
stout
its
not
bad
and
unique
could
be
worth
daring
repeats
and
more
ventures
into
this
type
of
thing
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
dare
i
say
its
better
than
guinness
d
way
better
than
my
rating
might
reflect
a
successful
experiment
perhaps
not
my
favourite
but
worth
trying
recommended
end
beer
musing
im
pretty
sure
this
and
the
wrassler
is
the
same
beer
recipe
with
the
exception
of
the
addition
of
the
oysters
and
a
slight
tweak
of
hops
though
this
comes
off
a
bit
muddled
flavor
wise
my
average
expectations
derive
from
the
lack
of
oyster
content
which
i
was
looking
forward
to
maybe
theres
a
hint
of
brininess
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
good
if
not
particularly
memorable
stout
the
beer
has
a
nice
dry
mouthfeel
and
some
nice
roasty
malt
notes
that
impart
soft
and
powdery
tasting
and
feeling
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
pumpernickel
bread
crsut
with
that
dry
finish
makes
this
a
session
stout
marks
above
guinness
in
my
opinion
pours
very
dark
brown
to
light
black
light
tan
head
nose
has
chocolate
and
a
metallic
sort
of
aroma
also
reminds
me
of
smell
of
heating
coils
on
old
school
space
heater
roasty
flavors
on
palate
easy
drinking
quite
light
actually
and
i
cant
detect
oysters
d
two
would
do
d
a
decent
oyster
stout
not
my
favorite
but
worth
checking
out
d
excellent
example
of
style
and
a
great
experience
a
well
balanced
dry
stout
the
oysters
are
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
though
after
having
a
domestic
oyster
stout
or
two
i
didnt
expect
these
elements
to
be
overly
assertive
curious
what
this
would
be
like
on
cask
drinkability
little
oysters
little
oysters
but
answer
there
came
none
lackluster
flavor
that
leaves
much
to
be
desired
with
some
nearing
watery
aspects
to
it
make
for
a
very
hohum
experience
d
this
was
interesting
like
a
smoked
irish
dry
stout
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
yeasty
zing
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
bone
dry
roasted
malt
flavor
along
with
a
black
malt
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
weird
tang
that
i
cant
pinpoint
oystersyeast
esters
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
dry
stout
im
not
sure
what
character
if
any
the
oysters
contribute
but
this
is
a
tasty
beer
regardless
the
flavor
exhibits
some
lightlybitter
chocolate
characteristics
as
well
as
a
light
earthy
note
some
slight
roast
is
there
as
well
something
a
bit
off
that
i
cant
quite
name
the
body
is
a
bit
light
with
carbonaion
toward
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
finish
is
quite
dry
drinks
fairly
well
definitely
interestidry
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
if
they
were
at
the
local
pub
but
for
the
price
here
in
the
us
i
wont
be
reaching
for
another
dr
too
bland
and
too
expensive
to
consider
again
this
is
the
best
of
the
porterhouses
selfbrewed
stouts
but
that
isnt
saying
much
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
two
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
smells
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
slight
dry
hop
hint
of
coffee
and
hint
of
grass
fits
the
style
of
an
irish
dry
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
citrus
and
slight
spice
ginger
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
want
in
an
irish
dry
stout
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
pretty
darn
black
the
beer
also
had
a
strange
fruity
smell
to
it
also
i
guess
i
should
mention
the
beer
had
a
pretty
decent
head
that
was
mocha
colored
and
fat
i
did
not
like
the
beer
as
it
was
bitter
and
off
balanced
tasting
this
is
as
good
as
this
style
gets
imo
overall
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
however
it
is
quite
good
and
a
nice
representative
of
the
style
solid
beer
and
easy
to
enjoy
a
couple
of
d
very
drinkable
little
stout
but
that
strange
finish
really
makes
you
want
to
have
just
one
hey
it
is
a
crazy
idea
worth
a
try
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
stout
that
would
go
well
with
a
soft
cheese
and
crackers
the
saltiness
of
the
oysters
comes
through
at
the
end
of
the
flavor
interesting
pours
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
black
color
no
highlights
lightmedium

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
drinks
just
like
a
dry
stout
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
is
it
made
with
oysters
okay
doesnt
really
make
it
stand
out
from
any
others
in
the
style
and
is
not
worth
paying
more
than
others
in
the
style
seems
to
be
more
of
a
novelty
to
me
nonetheless
still
a
fine
irish
dry
stout
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
not
great
with
cardboard
burnt
malt
coffee
plastic
and
hops
the
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
with
only
the
coffee
burnt
malt
and
hops
the
palate
is
thick
and
right
for
the
style
overall
a
decent
beer
but
with
an
aroma
problem
maybe
its
the
oysters
drinkability
not
bad
id
drink
again
taste
is
more
mild
than
aroma
dryer
with
lightly
sweetsour
fruit
turned
figs
up
front
and
gentle
darkly
roasted
barley
and
dark
toast
following
with
a
light
seashellfish
twang
hint
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
it
has
light
woodyroasty
bitterness
and
bite
at
the
finish
very
gentle
with
nice
subtle
complexity
drinkability
is
high
and
the
feel
is
firm
not
watery
or
oily
ive
never
had
an
oyster
stout
before
but
based
on
this
one
id
try
one
again
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
with
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
and
the
abv
is
low
enough
one
could
drink
several
in
a
session
should
be
quite
nice
with
fresh
oysters
but
with
the
acidity
it
can
be
paired
well
with
some
hearty
irish
food
such
as
a
shepherds
pie
or
a
smoked
salmon
boxty
as
well
as
a
bunch
of
other
irish
dishes
i
am
liking
it
but
then
im
half
irish
notes
although
the
price
will
keep
this
from
being
a
staple
in
the
fridge
it
is
worthy
of
a
purchase
generally
a
good
flavored
irish
stout
but
without
the
smooth
creamy
texture
and
taste
that
is
expected
for
most
irish
stouts
this
one
adds
that
minerallybriney
taste
that
is
as
interesting
and
alluring
as
it
is
distracting
ive
never
had
an
oyster
stout
and
have
always
been
intrigued
to
try
one
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
pours
a
deep
almost
opaque
black
that
shows
slight
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
beer
is
topped
with
a
nice
frothy
light
tan
head
that
is
quick
to
diminish
to
a
ring
leaving
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
and
mild
salt
with
just
a
trace
of
any
oyster
smell
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
just
in
front
of
a
distinct
oyster
taste
fairly
well
balanced
the
beer
is
quite
light
and
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
brew
im
glad
to
have
tried
an
oyster
stout
but
im
not
sure
if
ill
be
trying
any
more
had
this
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
my
first
from
this
brewery
and
only
my
second
real
oyster
stout
pours
a
garnet
tinged
brown
with
good
clarity
and
a
strange
white
head
with
a
garnet
tint
smells
slightly
salty
and
savory
with
some
creamy
sweetness
playing
off
the
other
aromas
the
taste
is
similar
starts
with
a
light
creaminess
and
a
slight
bitterness
and
finishes
with
an
overlay
of
brine
a
touch
of
iodine
and
light
but
complex
umami
notes
smooth
and
light
in
the
mouth
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
be
going
back
for
more
according
to
these
folks
they
are
irelands
largest
irish
brewery
that
bodes
ill
for
their
beers
but
lets
find
out
pours
a
deep
almost
opaque
mahogany
lots
of
creamy
slightly
tannish
head
that
sticks
like
glue
heavily
punctuated
with
burned
brown
sugar
notes
in
the
nose
like
you
overcooked
some
syrup
or
something
also
some
intersting
spicy
notes
unusual
and
hard
to
place
flavor
is
sharp
and
carries
some
mint
and
aniselike
qualities
right
up
front
very
different
highly
roasted
malt
flavors
in
here
and
a
weird
tang
i
cant
quite
place
they
claim
its
brewed
with
oysters
so
maybe
thats
the
reason
for
some
of
these
characteristics
finish
is
somewhat
thin
and
carries
a
sharp
bitterness
overall
id
have
to
say
this
is
average
at
best
but
it
is
unique
and
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
beware
the
pulltop
opener
its
a
death
trap
d
what
is
it
with
this
brewery
ive
had
three
beers
from
them
none
of
them
resembling
anything
enjoyable
oh
well
drinkability
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
wish
this
came
in
sixpacks
i
had
no
idea
an
irish
dry
stout
could
be
so
interesting
and
complex
on
top
of
that
its
relatively
lightbodied
with
a
manageable
abv
highly
recommended
drinks
im
impressed
with
the
balance
this
beer
strikes
its
decidedly
mild
but
utilizes
the
flavors
that
are
there
to
their
fullest
extent
i
wont
be
shellfish
in
recommending
it
d
average
drinkability
but
after
finishing
the
pint
im
ready
to
try
something
different
i
think
that
its
the
saltiness
thats
making
me
thirsty
for
a
more
refreshing
beer
kinda
like
the
bartender
mixed
the
salted
peanuts
with
the
stout
in
order
to
get
people
to
drink
more
of
it
its
an
ok
sipper
but
really
doesnt
do
the
trick
for
me
drinkability
i
could
see
downing
a
few
pints
of
this
in
a
pub
i
wouldnt
want
it
all
the
time
much
different
from
any
irish
stout
ive
tasted
it
may
also
be
the
best
ive
tasted
out
of
ireland
outstanding
d
my
favourite
of
the
day
at
beachwood
this
is
delicious
complex
stout
very
tasty
this
place
is
a
must
visit
if
im
ever
in
dublintown
get
a
pint
and
go
back
to
the
1800s
with
this
beer
probably
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
a
stout
from
joyces
day
d
this
is
a
nice
rich
stout
with
a
lot
of
malt
complexity
to
back
the
roasted
character
much
better
than
the
beer
you
find
in
the
rest
of
dublin
d
may
not
be
to
the
liking
of
all
but
oh
my
as
tasty
a
version
of
the
style
as
ive
had
yet
dont
be
scared
off
by
the
oyster
in
oyster
stout
if
youre
crustaceanaverse
you
really
wouldnt
know
it
and
youd
miss
out
on
an
extremely
tasty
beer
loved
it
and
could
have
several
more
notes
so
this
isnt
my
first
oyster
stout
and
the
oyster
character
is
no
where
to
be
found
or
at
least
i
cant
find
it
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
aroma
and
the
beginning
of
the
sip
is
delicious
but
then
it
just
falls
apart
in
the
finish
if
it
was
able
to
maintain
that
nice
medium
body
and
sweetness
through
the
finish
i
would
be
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
significantly
more
dark

the
beers
distinctiveness
is
debatable
but
its
quality
and
superbness
is
not
theres
no
doubt
that
if
i
owned
a
restaurant
that
sold
oysters
porterhouse
oyster
stout
would
be
on
the
menu
i
imagine
the
beers
scope
is
not
limited
only
to
seafood
anything
this
roasty
and
bittersweet
is
a
natural
fit
for
dessert
as
well
not
that
it
actually
needs
any
food
at
all
it
does
make
a
wonderful
pint
or
330ml
bottle
on
its
own
porterhouse
oyster
stout
is
wonderful
beer
that
comes
in
an
attractive
package
it
was
probably
too
expensive
for
regular
consumption
but
this
little
330
ml
bottle
is
quite
the
treat
recommended
d
interesting
flavor
that
i
really
cant
place
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
i
could
definitely
see
it
pairing
well
with
seafood
i
would
pick
it
up
again
but
wouldnt
go
crazy
trying
to
obtain
it
d
decent
enough
but
nothing
special
the

the

i

its
still
a

with

why
would
you
have

there
were
other

this
is
a
decent
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
about
the
taste
of
actual
oysters
theres
nothing
briny
salty
savory
in
there
at
all
even
if
they
do
throw
a

it
seems
that
its
just
for
show
that
ultrasmoothness
is
a
result
of
nitrogen
had
a
bottle
with
my
dessert
panino
at
tria
with
the
extra
strength
and
body
compared
to
other
irish
stouts
this
beer
came
off
a
bit
more
like
an
english
stout
i
suppose
that
body
could
be
from
the
oysters
anyways
the
stout
had
a
lot
more
earthy
and
herbal
taste
than
most
but
it
was
still
capped
off
by
black
roasted
grains
overall
this
beer
was
interesting
delicious
and
a
great
way
to
cap
off
a
meal
the
last
time
and
also
the
first
time
i
tried
oyster
stout
i
was
a
touch
disappointed
but
that
was
most
likely
because
i
had
heard
many
a
soul
rant
and
rave
about
how
this
was
the
best
beer
ever
produced
in
the
history
of
humanity
and
nothing
could
ever
have
lived
up
to
the
expectations
i
had
allowed
to
develop
in
advance
of
my
trip
to
dublin
in
2008
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
reacquainting
myself
with
the
oyster
stout
again
the
actual
beer
was
a
deep
ruby
red
although
the
head
was
rockier
than
the
wrasslers
the
usual
stout
aromas
abounded
chocolate
and
coffee
front
and
centre
but
there
was
something
else
lurking
in
the
background
something
i
couldnt
place
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
was
that
it
had
a
touch
of
the
sea
about
it
somewhat
akin
to
the
islay
whiskies
perhaps
that
was
pure
suggestion
but
there
we
go
as
far
as
drinking
goes
this
is
lighter
than
the
wrasslers
but
full
of
flavour
and
with
a
long
bitter
finish
simply
put
it
is
great
drinking
and
beats
the
stuff
on
nitro
in
dublin
this
is
the
first
oyster
stout
ive
ever
had
and
based
on
this
beer
i
hope
it
wont
be
the
last
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
im
just
not
digging
it
for
some
reason
you
might
like
it
though
this
beer
is
a
drinker
and
with
the
reasonably
low
abv
you
can
certainly
put
a
few
away
its
a
winner
although
a
bit
pricey
lighter
body
but
fills
the
mouth
nicely
carbonation
is
just
prickly
enough
to
keep
it
lively
and
easy
drinking
not
real
filling
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
a
nice
example
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
some
decent
initial
head
and
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
throughout
nice
scent
some
nice
deep
dark
malts
roasted
grains
a
nice
clean
stout
scent
good
taste
a
nice
semiroasty
sweet
maltiness
with
an
interesting
slight
mineral
taste
from
the
oysters
nothing
fantastic
but
it
is
a
solid
stout
goes
down
very
smooth
and
even
with
the
slight
oyster
mineral
taste
i
could
have
several
of
these
at
a
long
sitting
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
hells
yes
totally
drinkable
imperitavely
drinkable
you
should
be
drinking
this
right
now
fool
if
i
had
two
sixers
of
this
smashing
5
2abv
stout
i
wouldnt
be
writing
this
right
now
id
be
on
my
porch
listening
to
tom
waits
nighthawks
at
the
diner
live
album
smoking
a
cigarette
getting
wonderfully
potzed
to
a
wonderful
beer
to
a
wonderful
album
god
someone
bless
america
and
ireland
while
were
at
it
after
all
they
made
this
damn
delicious
beverage
i
was
even
ready
to
write
this
silly
thing
off
after
reading
its
labels
the
word
irish
appears
like
forty
times
on
the
front
label
alone
okay
a
little
artistic
license
there
sooo
glad
i
looked
past
that
one
pretentious
quality
of
the
packaging
do
yourselves
a
favor
if
you
see
this
beer
anywhere
buy
it
besides
that
its
pretty
good
overall
a
little
thin
almost
like
a
dark
lager
but
packing
some
serious
flavor
pretty
sure
i
got
the
oyster
in
the
smell
but
couldnt
nail
it
down
in
the
flavor
would
compliment
this
as
an
easy
drinking
stout
and
one
that
i
would
buy
again
overall
ill
echo
my
previous
statement
of
not
bad
i
really
cant
detect
any
oyster
but
otherwise
remains
an
average
dry
stout
a
bit
thin
and
watery
needs
a
little
more
punch
im
not
sure
if
the
grenade
pull
pin
on
the
cap
is
gimmicky
or
not
but
i
kind
of
like
it
overall
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
of
experience
in
the
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
smoother
ones
i
remember
having
worth
a
shot
really
not
much
going
on
here
rather
shallow
id
say
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
too
shame
oh
well
still
glad
i
could
try
it
even
though
this
just
isnt
for
me
aroma
is
rich
and
smoky
with
a
firm
undertone
of
molasses
it
pours
a
dark
nearly
opaque
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
too
persistent
beige
head
flavor
is
like
roast
coffee
with
a
smidgen
of
barleywine
and
a
touch
of
molasses
texture
is
fizzy
and
lively
and
just
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
a
bit
too
lively
to
be
easy
drinking
as
an
irish
dry
should
be
but
nice
take
and
good
to
finally
have
in
bottles
very
refreshing
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
d
nice
dry
irish
stout
the
subtly
of
the
oysters
adds
a
nice
layer
without
making
this
just
an
oddity
the
body
was
light
there
was
some
slick
notes
that
i
associate
with
diacetyl
but
not
really
in
the
taste
the
carbonation
was
light
which
was
nice
for
a
nitro
overall
its
difficult
trying
to
get
past
the
butyric
notes
for
this
one
and
this
one
is
not
really
an
irish
stout
imho
overall
this
one
is
the
sweetest
of
the
three
stouts
the
porterhouse
brews
its
easy
to
see
why
its
so
popular
though
a
musttry
this
is
my
favorite
irish
stout
amazingly
wellmade
i
have
to
admit
i
could
not
drink
too
much
of
it
several
glasses
are
fine
but
sometimes
it
feels
too
intensestrong
overall
solid
competition
for
the
bigger
boys
in
the
irish
market
da
unique
stout
my
first
oyster
stout
well
worth
the
try
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
typical
dry
stouts
the
reason
for
my
bombshell
2
5
mouthfeel
score
is
that
20
to
30
minutes
after
i
had
paid
my
tab
and
was
walking
around
dublin
i
still
had
the
oystery
fishy
taste
in
my
mouth
it
was
not
very
pleasant
had
i
cleansed
my
palate
with
an
other
beer
before
leaving
perhaps
this
not
would
have
happened
but
it
was
definitely
a
downer
this
is
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
but
the
plain
porter
they
brew
is
fantastic
as
well
and
i
would
take
that
over
the
oyster
any
day
i
enjoyed
this
and
its
my
first
choice
when
i
visit
the
porterhouse
extra
points
for
originality
i
find
its
best
to
try
this
with
a
pint
of
plain
alternating
at
least
a
couple
sips
allowing
you
to
clearly
taste
the
taste
of
dublin
bay
this
is
a
fairly
standard
wellcrafted
mediumbodied
stout
that
has
a
slight
seawater
taste
to
it
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
identify
a
particularly
oysterish
taste
though
they
do
note
on
the
beer
list
that
this
is
not
suitable
for
vegetarians
it
is
certainly
a
fine
brew
and
if
it
were
not
for
their
other
two
dark
brews
the
wrassler
stout
and
plain
porter
i
would
have
been
most
happy
with
a
session
drinking
this
brew
a
tasty
stout
very
interesting
my
favorite
stout
at
porterhouse
in
dublin
black
in
color
with
a
slight
hint
of
red
shining
through
nice
creamy
heads
maintains
itself
atop
the
liquid
aroma
is
great
i
think
i
really
do
smell
fresh
sea
oysters
this
is
a
very
aromatic
drink
esp
once
it
warms
and
opens
up
sweet
butter
english
tofee
smoky
irish
peat
dry
roasted
african
coffee
i
really
liked
the
aromas
taste
was
also
good
but
not
quite
as
amazing
tons
of
roasty
flavors
with
a
definite
salty
oyster
edge
to
it
i
had
a
few
pints
of
this
one
and
enjoyed
them
quite
nicely
tm
a
hint
of
seawater
kind
of
slightly
salty
flavour
comes
through
with
a
creamy
texture
of
roasted
maltsslightly
smoked
but
also
refreshing
along
with
floating
hoppy
presence
on
the
palate
lightly
savourysweet
finish
on
top
of
residual
lowlevel
bitterness
of
dark
malts
overall
its
mediumbodied
and
mediumflavoured
while
its
creamy
smooth
texture
is
not
compromised
by
oysters
but
apparently
thinner
than
xxxx
stout
it
could
be
more
dark
malty
and
roasted
bitter
to
be
really
flavoursome
but
i
can
imagine
that
it
pairs
well
with
fresh
oysters
all
the
same
not
quite
as
rich
or
malty
as
the
4x
stout
by
the
porterhouse
still
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
having
again
the
smoothest
stout
ive
ever
sampled
absolutely
astounding
not
much
taste
of
the
sea
but
a
pleasant
sweetness
that
changes
into
a
nice
bitter
finish
this
stout
poured
a
very
dark
brown
practically
black
with
creamy
tan
nitrogen
foam
that
clung
to
the
glass
and
coated
nicely
the
smell
was
faint
but
distinctly
dark
malt
the
taste
was
dark
malt
with
very
low
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
saltiness
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
dry
stout
this
was
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
stout
the
tastes
were
all
youd
expect
from
a
creamy
smooth
stout
some
licorice
and
coffee
perhaps
burnt
caramel
i
think
not
as
roasted
as
a
guinness
but
so
smooth
and
creamy
and
full
of
body
i
personally
and
irish
readers
dont
hate
me
here
rate
this
above
guinness
i
had
them
in
dublin
from
the
source
within
a
few
days
of
each
other
and
as
good
as
guinness
in
ireland
is
i
loved
this
stout
even
more
pretty
nice
but
a
bit
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
still
a
nice
bitter
coffee
flavour
and
very
smooth
nitrofied
which
i
dont
like
but
again
managed
to
keep
some
character
unlike
guinness
too
creamy
in
the
end
with
some
decent
amount
of
flavour
up
and
down
for
me
thers
good
and
bad
points
a
complex
stout
black
colour
toasted
aroma
ligthly
caramel
the
taste
is
less
toasted
but
with
licorice
and
vanilla
smooth
and
aromatic
maybe
because
it
is
brewed
with
fresh
oyster
the
aftertaste
is
liquerlike
sherry
and
spicy
and
light
bitter
more
evident
in
the
finish
good
body
dry
not
much
aroma
slightly
smoky
finish
i
really
hate
being
forced
to
write
a
review
since
thats
not
what
i
do
just
let
me
rate
the
beer
anyway
didnt
like
this
there
was
a
very
unpleasant
bitterness
that
made
this
almost
undrinkable
could
just
be
an
old
bottle
an
above
average
offering
from
lavery
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
good
but
the
minuscule
head
and
absence
of
lacing
coupled
with
the
watery
palate
lower
the
overall
appeal
of
this
beer
overall
very
well
brewed
beer
and
definitely
close
to
the
top
of
my
list
ov
this
is
a
solid
stout
with
the
addition
of
the
spicy
rye
adding
a
nice
little
dimension
of
depth
to
the
typical
dry
irish
stout
flavours
if
the
coffee
notes
were
stronger
id
be
enjoying
this
even
more
but
its
good
id
have
this
again
a
great
looking
great
smelling
stout
that
falls
a
little
short
in
the
taste
department
average
mouthfeel
as
well
makes
it
disappointing
ultimately
wish
there
was
more
flavor
and
body
not
bad
though
just
left
me
wanting
more
my
bottle
says
5
6
abv
overall
mild
in
its
ways
but
very
agreeable
this
was
an
easy
drinking
well
brewed
beer
from
lavery
i
would
be
interested
to
see
what
age
would
do
to
this
i
believe
it
would
sour
a
good
bit
from
the
house
yeast
employed
o
i
really
liked
the
spicy
nature
of
this
beer
as
it
wasnt
just
a
one
dimensional
stout
with
roasted
malt
flavors
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
like
the
beer
good
taste
and
a
great
draft
beer
worth
sipping
and
enjoying
gotta
be
the
right
temp
when
served
i
tasted
the
beer
the
first
time
at
the
crossroads
restaurant
in
edinboro
pa
my
comment
length
is
t
o
short
so
i
will
add
some
additional
stuff
so
it
meets
the
comment
field
requirement
for
number
of
characters
its
not
much
but
it
was
worth
trying
love

see

locals
ontap
3

overall
refreshing
really
like
the
mouthfeel
here
also
like
the
way
this
one
finishes
very
dry
the
brewer
knows
how
to
brew
a
well
attenuated
beer
every
bit
as
good
as
guinness
if
not
a
bit
better
silky
smooth
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
beautiful
beer
due
to
canadas
ridiculously
bizarre
liquor
laws
it
is
absolutely
unavailable
outside
of
a
good
irish
pub
that
will
likely
charge
one
exorbitant
prices
for
a
pint
of
said
beer
truly
tragic
if
you
can
get
it
on
tap
somewhere
take
it
over
guinness
and
allow
yourself
some
time
to
make
acquaintance
with
it
you
wont
regret
it
the
smell
is
decent
but
the
taste
too
watery
for
me
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
good
all
around
stout
great
all
around
beer
smooth
tasting
stout
with
rich
body
and
flavors
not
as
heavy
as
guinness
but
still
just
as
good
solid
stout
not
as
sweet
as
guinness
draught
pour
in
a
branded
glass
in
a
local
irish
pub
appearance
is
outstanding
with
a
completely
black
body
and
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
a
rich
milkchocolate
the
taste
is
a
blend
of
caramel
and
malt
smooth
and
perfectly
balanced
the
feel
is
less
heavy
and
less
bitter
than
guinness
draught
overall
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
ill
do
a
clancy
with
guinness
draught
if
i
want
a
little
heavier
stout
you
cant
beat
the
beautiful
head
on
this
beer
or
the
creaminess
in
general
just
wished
it
had
more
overall
flavor
but
i
suppose
thats
the
style
can
always
dump
in
some
cider
i
hate
to
rate
this
beer
or
any
beer
for
that
matter
as
an
apples
to
apples
comparison
to
another
but
given
the
similarities
with
the
widget
and
all
had
to
compare
it
to
guinness
cans
murphys
widget
must
not
be
on
par
with
the
guinness
widget
as
this
didnt
give
me
nearly
the
massive
upside
down
hourglass
looking
head
to
beer
transformation
this
also
led
to
a
less
than
full
body
when
compared
nose
was
muted
as
well
the
taste
though
more
complexity
than
guinness
dark
fruit
and
a
little
more
nuttiness
than
its
contemporary
overall
excellent
stout
o
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
a
murphys
its
a
good
irish
dry
stout
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
im
a
bit
partial
to
guinness
but
this
is
a
good
dry
irish
stout
nonetheless
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
stout
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
stout
just
didnt
tingle
my
toes
the
beer
does
pour
a
gorgeous
black
color
with
an
appealing
tan
head
that
has
some
pretty
good
staying
power
thats
about
it
the
rest
was
relatively
meh
watery
feel
strong
aftertaste
nothing
that
really
impressed
me
outside
of
the
low
carbonation
i
do
prefer
dark
opaque
brown
beer
with
a
tawny
foam
smells
of
mild
grain
and
chocolate
taste
is
lightly
chocolate
grain
nice
and
smooth
lightly
sweet
but
with
faint
bitterness
keeps
it
nice
and
dry
lighter
medium
mouthfeel
is
creamy
easy
to
drink
o
goes
down
entirely
too
fast
sessionable
and
a
classic
my
favorite
irish
stout
to
date
love
the
silk
smoothness
almost
like
the
texture
of
drinking
chocolate
milk
the
light
burnt
nut
taste
is
what
really
puts
this
one
over
the
top
for
me
i
stopped
buying
guinness
after
tasting
this
one
a
slightly
dry
irish
stout
at
its
best
damn
good
stout
the
nitro
can
is
unique
like
the
body
the
flavor
profile
is
light
in
intensity
slightly
complex
and
well
balanced
it
delivers
a
blend
of
chocolate
and
roast
that
flows
to
a
mild
bitterness
as
the
bitterness
fades
caramel
is
detected
underneath
along
with
a
nice
dominate
mineral
note
the
finish
is
a
lingering
mineral
bitter
note
great
stout
comparable
to
guiness
but
better
a
great
example
of
the
style
if
you
like
the
nitro
effect
of
a
stout
on
draft
you
ought
to
try
this
murphys
makes
a
great
dessert
beer
that
can
be
slowly
enjoyed
anywhere
anytime
additionally
its
smooth
mouthfeel
and
lower
level
of
carbonation
means
that
2
or
3
of
these
could
go
down
easier
than
youd
think
similar
but
different
to
guinness
would
have
to
try
again
with
both
side
by
side
smells
good
coffeelike
flavor
in
my
opinion
perhaps
even
better
than
guinness
looks
the
way
it
tastes
rich
smell
isnt
really
special
smooth
creamy
irish
stout
that
rivals
guinness
in
the
can
pretty
good
stout
i
recommend
good
beer
ill
make
a
habit
of
picking
a
couple
cans
up
from
trader
joes
regularly
certainly
worth
it
at
the
price
overall
very
good
in
all
camps
with
no
scores
below
four
and
no
element
that
flags
in
terms
of
the
style
this
one
is
better
than
the
more
famous
and
better
known
guinness
pours
beautiful
decent
tan
head
and
tremendous
lacing
aroma
is
mild
and
smells
like
creamy
hot
chocolate
ok
this
is
where
it
turns
south
from
here
this
beer
tries
but
does
not
give
its
best
effort
i
get
hints
of
malt
hot
chocolate
and
creaminess
but
it
is
like
someone
added
water
to
my
beer
when
i
wasnt
looking
this
beer
lacks
the
complexity
that
i
expected
very
weak
maybe
a
bad
batch
maybe
not
if
you
think
the
u
s
murphys
is
good
try
a
draft
when
you
are
in
ireland
its
smoother
than
a
babys
butt
no
aftertaste
could
drink
this
all
day
the
murphys
irish
stout
is
a
very
dark
almost
black
stout
beer
with
a
very
thick
tan
head
and
strong
lacing
left
on
the
glass
very
deep
roasted
malt
smell
with
tiny
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
very
similar
to
guinness
but
without
the
over
powering
coffee
taste
an
instant

overall
good
stout
staple
for
sipping
during
a
movie
or
pairing
with
music
a
flavorful
brew
and
very
quaffable
i
think
it
is
definitely
superior
to
the
guinness
available
in
the
u
s
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
it
definitely
grew
on
me
as
i
worked
my
way
down
the
glass
lighter
smoother
less
bitter
than
guinness
its
is
a
good
alternative
to
that
one
with
a
solid
taste
to
back
it
up
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
tastes
by
the
can
since
its
hard
to
find
on
draught
in
the
uk
these
days
poured
from
a
nitrocan
into
a
pint
glass
a
nougat
coloured
head
over
a
deep
dark
cola
body
there
is
lots
of
action
beneath
the
surface
after
the
intial
pour
smells
of
roast
burnt
toast
and
grain
the
taste
is
mild
with
coffee
and
chocolate
undertones
mixing
with
the
burnt
toast
of
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
seems
too
thin
and
watery
for
a
stout
overall
its
not
too
bad
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
o
it
looks
amazing
and
the
smooth
feel
is
impressive
otherwise
this
ones
fairly
unimpressive
not
bad
but
not
impressive
when
you
first
sip
this
beer
you
would
think
someone
poured
a
cup
of
water
into
your
glass
the
beer
is
watery
and
flat
like
drinking
flat
soda
i
dont
normally
waste
beer
but
im
thinking
long
and
hard
about
pouring
this
down
the
sink
compare
to
the
other
stouts
i
had
in
the
past
this
is
the
best
handsdown
overall
not
a
bad
experience
and
the
best
i
could
get
where
i
was
if
i
am
forced
to
go
listen
to
drunk
secretaries
sing
karaoke
and
all
the
horror
that
entails
this
will
at
least
help
me
feel
better
about
it
if
it
were
possible
to
be
worse
than
guinness
guinness
draught
this
would
be
it
thin
watery
bitter
flat
tastes
like
something
gone
bad
doesnt
look
bad
smell
too
bad
or
have
a
bad
mouth
feel
but
it
tastes
so
bad
its
hard
to
finish
a
can
o
what
can
i
say
its
murphys
hits
dead
on
for
style
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
its
simple
and
elegant
and
dependable

for
when

knock

an
excellent
stout
for
any
occasion
enjoyed
a
pint
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
on
good
old
st
paddys
day
of
course
pretty
cool
that
they
brought
this
classic
in
for
the
occasion
a
dark
brownish
black
brew
with
a
reddish
twinkle
here
and
there
although
largely
opaque
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
smells
like
dry
chalky
chocolate
and
light
roast
coffee
with
hints
of
medicinal
licorice
and
fruity
esters
than
recall
red
berries
lewis
in
his
book
on
stouts
part
of
the
classic
beer
styles
series
describes
this
brew
as
extremely
dry
and
roasty
and
i
do
not
disagree
it
is
bone
dry
but
also
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
quite
carbonated
but
nevertheless
easy
on
the
mouth
light
bodied
and
crisp
i
get
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
but
also
a
robust
fruitiness
perhaps
unique
to
the
tap
format
with
some
cherry
gum
strawberry
grape
and
faint
mint
adding
a
rather
refreshing
element
that
moderately
offsets
the
dryness
does
not
come
off
like
a
massproduced
brew
but
should
certainly
work
as
a
session
option
for
the
dark
malt
aficionado
gotta
say
it
beats
guinness
by
a
long
shot
from
my
perspective

and

very
onedimensional
with
no
undertones
no
hop
flavors
silky
mouthfeel
that
is
very
sensual
the
best
part
of
this
brew
a
saint
pattys
day
beer
that
is
at
least
better
than
green
tinted
budweiser
overall
a
rather
decent
irish
stout
it
starts
out
sweeter
but
dries
out
nicely
with
a
decent
level
of
bitterness
from
coffee
and
earthy
hop
flavors
with
the
nitro
style
pour
it
makes
for
a
good
feel
for
the
mix
of
roast
and
bitter
as
well
as
for
the
lower
abv
of
the
beer
and
make
for
a
rather
decent
session
style
drinker
overall
a
good
stout
and
a
good
substitute
when
guinness
isnt
available
i
must
admit
im
a
little
confused
by
the
ratings
here
for
this
beer
ive
done
many
back
to
back
comparisons
with
guinness
and
this
beer
is
milder
version
of
guineas
less
flavor
but
more
creamy
guinness
is
in
no
way
perfect
but
this
beer
is
in
my
opinion
lacks
the
flavor
that
guinness
has
still
a
good
beer
try
it
must
try
it
hits
the
right
notes
for
a
milder
stout
quite
enjoyable
some
charred
barley
but
like
most
from
this
style
it
is
on
the
easy
drinking
creamy
laid
back
watered
taste
milky
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
is
average
just
because
i
cant
see
myself
looking
forward
to
this
or
pursuing
it
any
time
soon
once
again
another
brew
id
prefer
to
try
on
tap
without
the
nitro
blasting
ball
but
for
this
review
in
a
can
its
simply
uneventfull
overall
this
will
my
goto
stout
from
now
on
whenever
there
isnt
many
specialty
stouts
to
choose
from
murphys
stout
is
more
delicious
than
i
remember
it
being
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
can
and
do
a
comparative
tasting
of
it
and
guinness
i
suspect
that
murphys
would
win
handsdown
if
memory
serves
its
sweeter
on
the
palate
drier
in
the
hang
and
its
roasted
malt
flavors
are
better
balanced
by
hopping
o
pretty
typical
of
an
irish
dry
stout
perhaps
a
bit
more
complex
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
smells
rich
and
the
taste
is
perfect
just
the
right
amount
of
bittery
undertones
and
a
clean
clean
clean
drink
tasting
something
like
a
bitter
chocolate
or
a
toasted
nut
of
something
just
perfect
smooth
and
thick
without
being
bloatyinducing
murphys
irish
stout
pours
a
black
color
with
a
large
creamy
head
there
is
a
creamy
dry
aroma
with
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
the
taste
is
very
creamy
nice
smokey
and
very
dry
malty
flavors
nice
taste
but
watery
body
overall
its
a
nice
irish
dry
stout
a
step
above
guinness
thin
and
rather
flavorless
its
nice
to
have
a
lowabv
stout
but
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
including
much
better
nitro
irish
dry
stouts
so
ill
pass
on
this
one
for
the
foreseeable
future
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
faint
garnet
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
that
persists
forever
and
ever
aromas
of
earthy
roasty
coffee
and
light
cream
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
a
slightly
mineralized
caramel
and
coffee
with
bits
of
earth
and
roast
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
watery
mouthfeel
and
a
lingering
roasted
bitterness
on
the
palette
easy
drinking
somewhat
flavorful
creamy
ale
i
could
pound
a
few
of
these
back
if
i
were
in
it
for
the
long
haul
overall
not
as
thick
as
guinness
but
a
bit
sweeter
and
smoother
overall
there
are
much
better
in
this
style
if
youre
looking
for
a
hearty
beer
dont
be
fooled
by
stout
on
in
this
case
the
can
decent
beer
but
nothing
compared
to
many
other
stouts
ive
had
before
last
thoughts
looks
perfect
and
wont
disappoint
the
beer
drinker
however
the
stout
lover
may
want
to
try
a
friends
before
purchase
served
from
a
nitro
can
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
good
underrated
dry
irish
stout
frankly
ill
drink
this
over
guinness
any
day
of
the
week
sorry
fellow
irish
new
englanders
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
quite
smooth
appearance
is
dark
a
healthy
white
head
with
only
minor
lacing
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
some
coffee
notes
and
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
one
of
those
oldschool
stouts
that
i
could
drink
by
a
gallon
o
distinct
flavor
with
a
high
level
of
drinkability
which
pairs
nicely
with
the
low
abv
definitely
something
you
can
slug
and
readily
available
at
a
reasonable
price
i
am
fan
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
try
a
stout
that
is
easy
to
find
and
is
readily
available
oas
good
as
youre
going
to
get
from
a
can
excellent
product
that
really
takes
me
back
to
times
spent
in
pubs
in
ireland
i
havent
had
this
in
quite
a
while
maybe
since
the
advent
of
widgets
a
delicious
creamy
mustache
stout
that
is
actually
very
middle
of
the
road
poured
into
a
goblet
at
approx
50
degrees
black
in
appearance
with
a
tan
dense
head
that
wasnt
going
anywhere
watery
mouth
feel
and
wonderful
after
essence
of
coffee
and
dark
roasted
grain
but
no
lingering
or
cloying
attributes
its
flavors
intensify
somewhat
as
it
warms
up
it
has
very
low
nitro
fizz
and
its
highly
drinkable
with
low
abv
very
enjoyable
overall
curiosity
found
me
a
new
favorite
stout
to
hap
on
tap
up
here
given
the
rather
limited
selection
of
most
fine
establishments
definitely
will
repeat
this
purchase
i
like
it
o
wellbalanced
sessionable
never
sates
an
easy
choice
o
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
my
favorite
irish
stout
to
date
its
simple
but
tasty
with
a
nice
nitro
mouthfeel
could
have
been
thicker
theres
a
light
roasty
chocolate
aroma
to
it
with
a
flavor
that
has
a
slight
roast
with
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
smooth
and
rounded
albeit
thinly
bodied
with
a
sweetish
finish
not
bad
for
a
buck
a
can
and
certainly
a
great
alternative
to
the
ubiquitous
guinness
a
pretty
good
beer
seems
like
a
step
or
2
above
guinness
o
a
solid
stout
that
covers
all
the
bases
i
love
the
way
it
pours
and
dances
across
the
palate
from
first
sip
to
final
drop
with
its
fresh
coffee
flavor
and
smooth
finish
id
highly
recommend
murphys
for
any
occasion
recommended
with
grilled
chicken
verdict
there
are
more
impressive
beers
out
there
sure
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
classic
irish
pint
then
i
cant
imagine
this
not
hitting
the
spot
overall
id
say
this
is
a
great
stout
definitely
one
up
from
the
traditional
guinness
grab
this
one
at
your
local
store
if
you
like
stouts
or
are
looking
for
something
new
to
try
overall
a
quintessential
example
of
this
underrated
style
delicious
o
this
irish
dry
stout
avoids
the
thin
feel
and
limpy
body
found
in
other
versions
of
the
style
that
helps
set
it
apart
really
enjoy
the
chocolate
taste
and
aroma
of
this
stout
goes
down
smooth
great
dessert
beer
not
a
very
complex
flavor
but
im
very
surprised
i
liked
this
beer
out
of
a
can
i
typically
dont
like
canned
beers
sue
me
doesnt
taste
as
dry
as
many
stouts
do
to
me
and
the
roasted
malt
flavor
really
works
coffee
aroma
and
tastes
were
present
as
well
overall
this
is
better
than
guinness
draught
and
an
excellent
example
of
a
dry
irish
stout
aftertaste
what
aftertaste
i
drink
there
is
a
hint
of
flavor
and
then
its
gone
again
there
is
literally
no
aftertaste
here
i
also
like
how
they
spell
draft
on
the
can
it
says
draught
style
that
is
not
how
you
spell
draft
oh
well
i
will
give
this
beer
credit
for
the
style
but
just
not
for
me
o
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
easily
the
smooth
and
creamy
nature
from
the
nitrocan
help
to
make
up
for
the
thin
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
take
a
murphys
over
a
guinness
any
day
o
a
decent
example
of
irish
stout
and
a
nice
alternative
to
guinesss
i
used
another
can
for
my
irish
stew
which
turned
out
fantastic
this
past
weekend
and
that
might
be
a
better
use
for
this
brew
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
better
than
guinness
draught
not
particularly
but
just
the
mildest
difference
in
having
more
chocolate
character
than
the
roasted
coffeelike
character
in
the
guinness
o
for
me
its
an
occasion
beer
i
prefer
it
to
guiness
from
here
in
the
states
anyway
but
other
than
drinking
irish
ill
get
my
stouts
elsewhere
too
many
good
craft
stouts
out
there
to
be
stuck
with
this
o
i
figured
id
try
a
new
irish
beer
for
st
pattys
day
but
upon
further
inspection
i
found
that
this
beer
is
brewed
in
the
uk
it
loses
some
style
points
there
overall
it
looks
amazing
in
the
glass
but
it
lacks
any
real
aroma
or
a
heavy
mouthfeel
that
i
expect
from
stouts
o
good
beer
the
style
itself
leads
to
beers
that
are
for
the
most
part
underwhelming
this
beer
however
is
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
ever
seen
it
tastes
standard
for
the
style
though
perhaps
a
bit
better
it
doesnt
have
the
earthydirt
notes
of
some
of
its
competitors
this
is
easy
drinking
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
o
since
my
beer
journey
has
started
in
earnest
it
feels
good
to
review
a
commonly
familiar
style
the
mouthfeel
offered
more
and
more
with
each
sip
o
i
tried
murphys
on
a
whim
one
day
instead
of
buying
guinness
and
enjoyed
it
at
the
time
grabbed
a
4pack
of
cans
for
st
patricks
day
this
year
and
still
found
this
a
pleasing
easydrinking
irish
stout
if
youre
looking
for
a
thick
complex
mealinacan
type
of
stout
this
isnt
it
this
one
is
made
for
drinking
a
few
in
a
sitting
or
maybe
having
one
with
a
meal
or
a
snack
pretty
comparable
to
a
guinness
though
maybe
a
little
more
flavorful
im
not
a
huge
stout
drinker
tending
to
pay
attention
to
it
mostly
around
st
patricks
day
however
as
a
rule
i
prefer
imperial
stouts
high
gravityalcohol
to
dry
irish
ones
of
course
imperial
stouts
are
sweeter
and
usually
more
complex
than
the
authentic
dry
irish
style
still
simplicity
is
a
beautiful
thing
as
ive
learned
with
german
beers
and
murphys
is
simple
and
great
i
really
love
a
good
irish
stout
and
i
think
this
is
a
particularly
good
one
its
certainly
much
much
better
than
the
locally
contractbrewed
guinness
youd
get
here
in
australia
at
4
abv
this
is
exquisitely
sessionable
indeed
the
whole
can
went
down
without
a
question
and
im
already
craving
another
two
words
flimsy
staple
overall
not
bad
not
stellar
its
a
good
stout
for
people
who
dont
like
huge
fullbodied
stouts
its
definitely
designed
ot
appeal
to
the
mass
market
poured
this
irish
dry
stout
from
a
16
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
brown
color
produced
a
thick
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
it
left
a
great
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
medium
bodied
very
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
a
bit
watered
down
but
it
does
have
some
base
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
not
a
huge
fan
of
irish
stouts
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
overall
it
is
what
it
is
basically
a
guiness
draft
in
a
different
suit
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
tell
the
difference
if
i
were
tested
final
thoughts
the
use
of
a
nitrocanning
definitely
improves
this
beer
and
makes
it
one
that
anyone
can
enjoy
would
i
drink
it
again
most
likely
but
i
dont
often
seek
it
out
quite
glad
i
got
this
instead
of
guinness
its
miles
better
and
for
a
better
price

descent
beer
tried
murphys
irish
stout
for
this
first
time
since
i
have
been
a
member
of
ba
the
beer
looked
great
nice
and
dark
with
foamy
slightly
off
white
head
that
left
spotty
lacing
the
smell
was
simple
hints
of
roast
and
espresso
thetaste
seemed
a
bit
off
to
me
the
beer
started
with
roastespresso
then
i
got
a
finish
that
seemed
to
have
bourbon
or
some
type
of
scotchwhiskey
in
it
wasnt
very
appealing
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
body
for
a
stout
with
subtle
carbonationl
overall
it
was
just
ok
overall
i
really
like
murphys
stout
its
dry
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
for
a
stout
and
very
tasty
i
will
continue
to
return
to
this
staple
in
the
future
o
true
to
style
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
suck
could
drink
a
few
in
a
session
no
problem
3
of
these
would
be
roughly
equal
to
one
of
the
many
imperial
stouts
out
there
worthy
of
an
occasional
purchase
overall
buy
it
it
is
underratedunfortunately
but
its
worth
every
sip
great
for
breakfast
lunch
and
dinner
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
doubt
i
will
seek
it
again
it
is
about
on
par
with
its
obvious
competitor
maybe
a
little
better
the
appearance
is
very
nice
but
i
wish
it
had
been
a
little
less
watery
overall
excellent
sipping
beer
dry
and
solid
at
only
4
0
not
too
much
guilt
be
sure
to
give
the
can
a
good
roll
before
to
loosen
up
the
nitrogen
i
can
imagine
that
it
looses
something
in
the
can
though
would
definitely
order
on
a
cold
night
off
a
tap
overall
true
drinkability
all
things
about
this
are
subtle
and
reserved
i
give
this
high
marks
because
you
continuously
want
another
sip
that
said
it
lacks
in
flavor
and
complexity
an
enjoyable
smoothness
however
o
a
decent
beer
it
is
definitively
a
lot
smoother
than
other
beers
of
the
same
style
which
for
some
may
be
good
poured
from
a
1
pint
can
into
a
pint
glass
nitro
can
this
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
foamy
nitro
head
which
leaves
a
finger
thick
head
which
remains
throughout
the
beer
the
smells
are
good
you
get
chocolate
coco
some
light
dark
roasted
malts
the
feel
is
medium
although
creamy
the
taste
is
pretty
good
somewhat
light
but
creamy
and
tasty
you
get
the
roasted
malts
light
bitterness
likely
oatmeal
smooth
nice
session
beer
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
and
have
numerous
times
even
buy
it
in
the
can
now
the
nose
is
of
rich
dark
chocolate
chicory
and
oatmeal
with
an
admirable
mouthfeel
not
too
unctuous
as
to
be
drinking
5w20
but
just
enough
weight
that
it
doesnt
feel
limp
also
enjoyable
is
the
fact
that
it
isnt
too
sweet
perhaps
less
so
than
guinness
and
noticeably
has
far
less
alcohol
than
many
domestic
stouts
making
this
a
great
long
termer
well
balanced
and
somewhat
straightforward
murphys
quenches
and
satisfies
without
attempting
to
be
pretentious
a
good
sessional
beer
not
too
bad
o
still
not
as
good
as
guinness
but
a
very
tasty
irish
stout
this
pours
a
typical
jetblack
for
the
style
with
the
nice
offwhite
creamy
head
on
top
aroma
is
mellow
slightly
roasty
and
slightly
sour
and
husky
flavor
is
very
on
par
mellow
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
behind
it
all
and
a
touch
tangy
finishes
with
a
creamy
mild
coffee
note
this
is
very
drinkable
and
for
the
style
very
good
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
as
a
subtle
but
tasty
stout
to
have
on
hand
when
i
want
a
simple
comforting
beer
looks
nice
and
smells
good
but
tastes
and
feels
weak
and
watery
wont
buy
again
overall
its
like
a
better
guinness
the
bitterness
is
complimentary
rather
than
overpowering
and
the
light
flavor
notes
are
pleasing
after
drinking
so
many
fancy
bears
this
was
a
great
break
a
very
pleasant
light
beer
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
cans
overall
this
is
a
decent
irish
stout
which
is
readily
available
at
many
places
at
only
4
abv
it
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
that
can
be
knocked
back
with
ease
plus
it
tastes
pretty
good
o
i
prefer
guinness
more
this
wasnt
as
watery
but
the
bitterness
got
in
the
way
of
the
flavor
for
me
overall
a
great
stout
and
also
great
as
12
of
a
black
tan
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night
or
whenever
you
want
to
sip
a
fine
stout
and
relax
overall
its
good
but
not
great
i
enjoyed
it
definitely
something
good
to
pick
up
on
and
enjoy
overall
great
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
watery
finish
would
be
excellent
o
this
beer
is
a
little
too
watery
in
texture
for
my
personal
preference
otherwise
its
an
excellent
stout
i
think
light
stout
describes
this
beer
well
and
it
would
probably
be
a
good
introductory
beer
for
someone
who
is
just
branching
over
into
the
world
of
stouts
if
there
was
a
stout
to
just
drink
easily
without
much
thought
this
would
be
it
irish
stouts
are
beautiful
beers
near
black
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
long
lasting
retention
and
ample
lacing
the
aroma
offers
some
bread
and
chocolates
the
aroma
is
gentle
but
enticing
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
milk
chocolate
character
a
hint
of
roast
and
no
bitterness
a
really
solid
example
of
the
style
perhaps
it
is
the
pasteurization
but
i
find
the
beer
a
bit
flatdead
tasting
even
while
it
hits
more
or
less
all
the
sufficient
style
notes
perhaps
a
bit
smoother
than
regular
canned
guinness
but
equally
mediocre
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
definitely
welcome
again
in
my
fridge
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
it
doesnt
get
the
fame
like
guinness
does
but
this
is
definitely
a
superior
brew
would
drink
again
o
depends
on
how
a
beer
should
be
judged
versus
type
this
stout
wouldnt
rate
well
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
overall
an
unpleasant
burnt
coffee
stout
the
worst
part
of
it
by
far
is
the
mouthfeel
watery
like
a
dark
lager
rather
than
creamy
like
a
stout
odcould
it
be
a
bit
better
than
guinness
draught
it
is
a
bit
rougher
around
the
edges
and
i
like
that
solid
taste
and
a
perfect
look
i
really
dont
care
how
the
beer
looks
but
this
is
just
too
perfectly
defined
in
appearance
to
not
warrant
a
5
nice
little
pint
o
for
what
it
is
id
say
it
has
more
flavor
than
guinness
even
if
it
isnt
nearly
as
popular
certainly
worth
a
turn
of
the
head
if
this
is
your
thing
its
drinkable
dangerously
so
since
it
has
no
carb
to
speak
of
and
is
notably
watery
d
this
was
about
on
par
with
guinness
nice
nitro
body
but
scent
and
taste
are
like
a
macro
stout
not
very
pleasant
although
not
entirely
repulsive
either
o
kim
kardashian
dark
and
drop
dead
gorgeous
but
very
little
substance
overall
for
4
you
really
cant
complain
nothing
impressive
but
nothing
offensive
either
real
simple
the
dryrish
stouts
are
not
my
cup
of
tea
full
disclosure
that
said
i
did
buy
a
case
in
march
after
getting
a
little
too
psyched
for
st
paddys
day
the
greatest
thing
about
this
beer
for
me
is
the
pour
the
science
of
the
widget
can
to
pint
glass
pour
almost
brings
a
tear
to
my
eye
after
that
its
all
downhill
very
little
aroma
and
what
j
could
detect
was
a
hint
of
malt
one
mouthful
tastes
of
sheer
boredom
to
me
i
do
prefer
it
far
beyond
guinness
but
again
its
just
not
my
type
of
beer
one
on
march
17th
for
me
and
thats
it
o
its
a
quality
old
standby
and
i
think
superior
to
its
main
competitor
it
seems
to
me
that
it
improves
significantly
as
it
warms
several
degrees
from
refrigerator
temperature
the
real
allure
of
this
beer
is
the
perfect
appearance
and
superbly
creamy
mouthfeel
that
few
beers
posses
however
despite
all
the
somewhat
rare
nitro
tricks
and
solid
nose
this
beer
has
very
little
substance
and
almost
tastes
like
a
guinness
extra
stout
combined
with
50
water
this
tasted
significantly
better
from
the
tap
in
new
zealand
with
a
more
substantial
body
and
stronger
flavors
i
might
purchase
a
few
more
cans
then
and
again
but
only
to
have
the
novelty
of
the
english
draught
experience
in
my
own
home
if
you
like
sweet
stouts
this
isnt
it
but
then
again
its
not
supposed
to
be
its
a
decent
example
of
what
it
is
a
dry
irish
stout
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
creamy
dark
brown
as
the
tan
head
builds
in
the
glass
sticky
lacing
coats
the
side
of
the
glass
as
this
beer
is
consumed
the
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
hit
the
nose
the
smells
are
mild
but
detectable
the
flavor
is
exactly
like
it
smells
there
are
dark
roasted
malts
smooth
bitter
chocolate
and
minor
bitter
coffee
notes
the
flavors
are
creamy
and
mellow
there
is
a
touch
of
astringency
as
well
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
pleasantly
sticks
to
the
mouth
its
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
gulp
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
classic
example
of
the
irish
dry
stout
murphys
is
cheaper
than
guinness
so
those
looking
to
experiment
with
this
style
could
turn
to
murphys
first
the
real
test
which
is
surprisingly
difficult
to
do
in
ireland
is
to
compare
the
tap
versions
of
the
three
irish
industrial
stouts
beamish
murphys
and
guinness
m
medium
body
somewhat
smooth
at
times
this
really
feels
like
a
nitrotap
and
at
other
times
it
is
a
touch
thin
o
really
enjoyed
this
somewhat
light
on
the
taste
but
has
just
enough
to
make
it
interesting
can
preserves
that
creamy
fromthetap
mouthfeel
and
makes
this
an
extremely
drinkable
stout
pours
nearly
black
with
mahogany
highlights
and
close
to
an
inch
of
luscious
tan
head

of
the
nitro
the
feel
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
to
say
the
least
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
typical
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
mellow
and
mildy
smokey
which
is
nice
enough
but
the
highlight
for
me
is
the
back
end
which
reveals
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
little
of
the
astrigency
that
can
mar
a
guinnesss
aftertaste
i
like
guiness
as
well
but
i
must
admit
i
was
presently
surprised
by
murphys
offering
so
much
so
that
id
probably
give
it
the
nod
over
its
more
widely
available
peer
definitely
a
terrific
stout
one
i
will
return
to
repeatedly
ov
it
is
extremely
similar
to
guinness
without
seeming
as
tart
or
as
expensive
it
is
refreshing
engaging
and
fulfilling
this
is
a
beer
that
does
not
disappoint
cheers
overall
this
is
handsdown
my
favourite
draught
stout
ive
been
to
ireland
and
there
beamish
murphys
and
guinness
are
all
really
good
from
the
tap
but
in
the
pub
cans
murphys
is
probably
the
best
in
the
us
the
low
abv
and
creamy
delicious
taste
make
this
one
of
my
alltime
favourites
probably
one
of
the
best
session
beers
around
and
the
price
is
usually
much
cheaper
than
guinness
overall
despite
the
beautiful
appearance
the
low
carbonation
resulting
in
a
flat
feel
was
the
notable
characteristic
this
beer
was
drunk
straight
from
the
refrigerator
so
may
try
it
again
at
a
warmer
temperature
i
decided
to
try
an
irish
beer
in
honor
of
st
patricks
day
and
chose
murphys
irish
stout
being
in
the
middle
of
a
belguim
beer
phase
i
was
pleasently
surprised
on
the
taste
of
this
stout
this
is
a
vey
mild
beer
and
as
a
result
goes
down
vey
smooth
i
normally
enjoy
a
beer
with
a
higher
alcohol
content
but
as
smooth
as
the
beer
is
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
on
a
short
period
of
time
drink
well
it
is
st
patricks
day
gunniess
was
the
easy
choice
this
was
pretty
good
with
a
creamy
malty
note
id
have
it
again
16
oz
nitro
can
poured
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
frothy
cream
color
head
smells
like
darkly
roasted
malt
very
sweetly
very
pleasant
for
a
stout
tastes
of
coffee
predominately
with
hints
of
caramel
but
initially
has
some
watery
taste
very
drinkable
and
smooth
going
down
really
easy
with
a
lighter
body
for
a
stout
overall
a
good
irish
stout
definitely
an
improvement
over
most
st
patricks
day
brews
from
ireland
available
in
the
usa
overall
go
ahead
and
drink
guinness
on
st
paddys
day
youre
short
changing
yourself
drink
this
instead
way
better
i
might
overrate
it
a
bit
because
i
drank
a
lot
of
these
on
my
honeymoon
but
i
do
like
it
i
get
excited
whenever
i
see
it
on
tap
at
a
bar
nice
change
of
pace
overall
drinkability
quite
drinkable
but
wonder
if
might
be
better
fresh
out
of
a
tap
rather
than
a
nitrocan
went
very
well
with
a
traditional
irish
dish
colcannon
and
i
could
probably
have
another
if
offered
but
since
i
only
bought
one
im
okay
with
that
good
but
nothing
special
this
is
in
no
way
a
bad
beer
but
the
flavor
is
rather
light
and
in
my
opinion
fleeting
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
perfect
for
the
style
though
i
find
i
like
the
creaminess
of
the
head
more
than
the
lighter
body
of
the
beer
itself
on
special
for
the
upcoming
st
patricks
day
holiday
murphys
stout
is
one
of
the
few
true
session
beers
available
around
me
classic
nitro
look
black
body
thick
and
creamy
mat
of
foam
faint
roast
like
weakly
brewed
coffee
and
a
toasted
nuttiness
firm
bitterness
at
the
back
end
along
with
some
earthy
hop
flavor
keeps
it
interesting
some
fruit
pulls
through
as
it
warms
up
dry
drinkable
and
a
tad
better
than
guinness
highly
recommended
poured
from
a
nitrocan
into
a
pint
glass
and
watched
the
show
begin
i
love
the
fallout
of
the
malty
tanbrown
head
as
the
inky
black
liquid
begins
to
emerge
below
this
process
lasted
a
couple
of
minutes
until
finally
a
34
inch
head
remained
on
top
of
the
black
stout
a
quarter
inch
head
remained
until
the
beer
was
finished
smells
of
creamy
malt
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
initially
creamy
but
gives
way
to
a
less
heavy
feeling
stout
almost
too
watery
the
taste
is
also
creamy
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
notes
of
roasted
almost
burned
nuts
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
traditional
stouts
would
love
to
have
one
on
tap
from
a
pub
in
ireland
one
day
the
palate
opens
dry
with
a
mild
lactose
character
with
a
little
bit
of
creamy
grainy
tartness
just
a
touch
of
smoke
is
present
but
theres
also
a
fairly
nice
roast
character
present
faintly
hoppy
on
the
finish
with
a
light
bitterness
this
is
drying
creamily
so
thanks
to
the
nitro
can
smooth
on
the
palate
almost
to
a
fault
this
feels
only
faintly
carbonated
i
dislike
what
the
nitropours
done
to
the
mouthfeel
solid
stuff
a
good
step
up
from
guinness
but
not
something
id
drink
a
lot
of
still
it
has
its
time
and
its
place
o
certainly
drinkable
but
not
really
worthy
of
the
stout
label
i
wont
be
abandoning
my
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
anytime
soon
very
high
drinkability
as
its
low
in
abv
and
has
a
decent
flavor
profile
served
to
me
at
baton
rouge
steakhouse
this
dry
stout
came
black
as
night
with
maybe
a
half
finger
of
head
aroma
was
of
coffee
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
was
lightly
bitter
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
a
bit
thick
overall
an
underwhelming
beer
anyone
who
thinks
a
dark
beer
is
a
bitter
flavor
bomb
should
drink
this
i
finished
the
can
off
but
with
no
desire
to
drink
another
maybe
if
i
was
drinking
a
super
fresh
example
in
cork
id
feel
differently
but
this
is
far
too
bland
for
me
to
ever
want
to
drink
agin
sometimes
i
feel
like
having
slightly
more
coffee
grounds
in
my
stout
and
that
is
when
i
have
a
murphys
when
i
want
more
emphasis
on
the
roasted
malt
i
drink
a
guinness
o
at
8
a
growler
this
really
does
hit
the
spot
for
me
i
can
understand
others
reservations
that
it
is
not
as
big
a
stout
as
most
but
the
passive
nature
is
very
drinkable
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
o
it
is
a
filling
beer
the
tastes
and
aromas
are
mild
it
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
but
not
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
coming
back
o
irish
dry
stouts
have
a
reputation
of
being
a
bit
plain
and
simple
however
i
really
enjoyed
this
very
pleasant
easy
drinking
and
a
little
better
than
guiness
imo
o
overall
this
beer
is
a
classic
dry
irish
stout
compares
favorably
to
guinness
but
perhaps
it
weighs
a
bit
too
much
to
session
in
the
way
one
can
quaff
guinnesses
overall
this
is
a
decent
irish
dry
stout
i
would
take
it
over
a
guinness
any
day
o
this
stout
does
not
impress
me
in
the
slightest
its
a
low
to
mid
range
offering
that
lacks
any
depth
of
character
and
doesnt
have
the
fame
or
popularity
of
guiness
id
recommend
avoiding
this
beer
if
you
want
anything
of
complexity
if
you
want
a
sessionable
easy
to
drink
stout
this
might
be
your
beer
but
its
not
mine
o
nothing
too
special
here
between
this
and
guinness
draught
id
say
this
is
slightly
better
the
nitrocan
gimmick
is
nice
as
hell
but
really
theres
no
substitute
for
having
a
pint
of
this
on
tap
probably
wouldnt
buy
cans
of
this
stuff
though
pours
a
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
very
faint
red
tinge
around
the
edges
creamy
tan
head
i
struggle
to
find
any
aroma
dry
very
mild
chocolate
taste
with
very
little
bitterness
very
smooth
with
hardly
any
carbonation
seems
kind
of
on
the
bland
side
with
not
much
as
far
as
anything
extraordinary
no
bitterness
and
certainly
finishes
dry
i
sense
some
sourness
in
the
middle
little
bit
of
a
chalky
feel
to
it
doesnt
have
anything
as
far
as
turn
offs
but
doesnt
excite
the
senses
either
overall
a
half
decent
beer
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
or
aroma
but
what
it
has
is
pleasant
very
very
drinkable
the
smell
is
not
overpowering
and
stays
low
key
with
a
lower
serving
tempature
its
nice
overall
and
prefer
it
slightly
to
guinness
overall
this
is
like
a
better
version
of
guinness
i
could
see
this
being
a
solid
session
beer
for
winter
especially
paired
with
the
fact
that
its
incredibly
cheap
overall
its
like
a
guinness
but
creamier
and
slightly
more
subdued
meaning
murphys
irish
stout
is
a
great
beer
for
introducing
people
to
the
style
its
easy
to
dink
and
still
maintains
enough
of
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
associated
with
stouts
to
get
the
point
across
again
its
not
the
best
stout
out
there
but
its
certainly
not
bad
for
a
macro
brew
bodymoderately
heavy
very
rich
and
creamy
on
the
tongue
without
being
too
heavy
there
is
some
effervescence
present
though
its
somewhere
between
light
and
moderate
overall
nice
everything
is
in
balance
the
bitter
offsets
the
sour
and
salty
flavor
and
the
little
bit
of
sweetness
keeps
it
interesting
its
certainly
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
great
for
a
session
beer
due
to
the
alcohol
would
get
it
again
not
bad
for
the
price
pairs
fairly
well
with
smoked
gouda
a
nice
pour
smokey
in
the
glass
with
a
thick
halo
of
head
about
15
of
the
glass
lacks
distinction
from
other
irish
stouts
enjoyable
but
nothing
remarkable
i
cannot
detect
any
strong
odor
emanating
from
the
glass
i
wonder
if
my
alergies
are
acting
up
good
mouthfeel
good
taste
just
good
good
good
notes
an
irish
stout
ho
hum
o
this
is
often
compared
to
guinness
and
for
good
reason
they
are
very
similar
with
the
murphys
coming
off
as
more
creamy
and
the
guinness
coming
off
with
slight
very
light
alcohol
presence
to
be
honest
i
didnt
feel
like
i
had
a
beer
at
all
more
like
something
you
drink
at
starbucks
cant
see
anything
special
about
this
but
i
suppose
it
would
perfect
for
those
starting
out
with
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
not
my
thing
i
want
a
bit
more
flavor
and
mouthfeel
to
my
stouts
overall
drinkability
no
redeeming
qualities
other
than
perhaps
the
sixermixer
price
of
1
50
per
can
overall
a
worthy
competitor
but
i
like
guinness
better
overall
some
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
going
on
here
but
overall
too
watery
for
a
stout
an
opaque
nearblack
with
a
lighter
and
persistent
headgorgeous
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
chocolate
and
roast
with
some
chalk
at
the
end
and
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
curiously
thin
offering
no
resistance
to
the
gulletkind
of
like
a
beer
version
of
chocolate
milk
comforting
and
smooth
and
sessionable
o
it
is
a
well
crafted
beer
and
a
great
example
for
its
style
i
will
drink
it
again
but
i
cant
shake
the
watery
impressions
it
gives
o
its
nice
alot
of
people
probably
hate
on
this
beer
but
for
what
it
is
i
enjoyed
it
very
creamy
body
could
use
more
carbonation
dr
easy
enough
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
one
pours
black
with
a
thick
solid
creamy
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
smells
of
roasted
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
metal
i
tasted
mostly
bitter
coffee
grinds
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
slightly
metallic
taste
the
beer
is
very
light
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
beers
not
bad
it
definitely
beats
guinness
draught
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
very
creamy
two
finger
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
nice
and
malty
but
not
too
sweet
not
very
complex
but
at
the
same
time
has
a
satisfying
taste
very
creamy
mouthfeel
one
of
the
best
ive
noticed
in
a
while
this
stout
doesnt
bring
anything
super
unique
but
it
does
just
what
its
supposed
to
as
a
dry
stout
i
would
recommend
this
over
guinness
o
the
ultimate
chillin
dry
stout
it
satisfies
without
making
you
think
too
much
hard
not
to
like
this
stout
oit
is
good
except
for
the
thin
mouthfeel
if
it
was
as
creamy
as
it
looks
it
would
be
really
good
in
view
of
the
above
this
is
a
welsh
sweet
stout
based
on
the
irish
style
it
is
in
my
opinion
a
very
nice
and
decent
drinkable
stout
that
edges
out
the
equivalent
guinness
productwhich
i
also
happen
to
like
overall
a
good
stout
with
nitro
a
tasty
stout
i
think
it
falls
short
of
guinness
but
still
a
worthy
adversary
o
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
stout
and
would
not
seek
it
out
again
o
despite
the
low
abv
and
low
expense
this
is
a
standout
beer
that
offers
the
best
a
craft
brew
drinker
could
hope
for
without
crushing
the
palate
or
compromising
the
faculties
of
the
frontal
lobe
really
a
great
beer
substantial
enough
that
having
just
one
wont
leave
you
dissatisfied
but
many
over
the
course
of
the
night
wont
leave
you
burnt
out
from
the
flavor
or
incapacitated
i
give
two
schlitz
for
murphys
irish
stout
overy
flat
and
naked
for
being
a
stout
taste
like
watered
down
cappuccino
very
creamy
and
drinkable
but
definitely
nothing
amazing
or
even
compares
to
other
stouts
does
look
beautiful
after
you
pour
it
though
a
little
better
and
more
flavor
than
guinness
draught
highly
drinkable
o
easy
drinker
good
for
the
style
good
for
a
few
o
overall
a
good
irish
dry
stout
that
is
pretty
guinesslike
not
ideal
for
this
summer
heat
but
considering
it
was
the
best
beer
they
had
on
tap
i
would
order
it
again
before
some
of
their
other
offerings
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
1
inch
dense
bone
colored
head
that
settles
down
into
a
small
cap
foamy
thick
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
coffee
beans
and
some
chocolate
aromas
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
primarily
with
some
dark
chocolate
flavors
to
a
lesser
extent
very
faint
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
an
almost
flat
and
creamy
texture
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
irish
stout
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
get
this
one
again
overall
decent
pub
beer
bit
one
dimensional
though
o
i
think
it
is
as
good
as
many
of
the
craft
varieties
it
stands
the
test
of
time
its
been
a
while
since
i
last
had
a
murphys
stout
howzabout
we
change
that
today
eh
it
pours
a
solid
matte
black
topped
by
an
even
more
solid
finger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
is
pretty
weak
comprising
some
extremely
mild
roasted
malts
light
cocoa
powder
and
a
touch
of
what
seemed
like
mint
the
taste
holds
notes
of
roasted
malts
light
dark
chocolate
very
light
molasses
and
that
light
twinge
of
mint
again
the
body
is
a
lightfeeling
medium
with
a
very
light
carbonation
and
a
rather
smooth
feel
overall
a
solid
irish
stout
one
that
could
easily
give
guinness
a
run
for
its
money
though
if
forced
to
choose
i
think
id
still
side
a
bit
more
quickly
with
the
boys
from
st
james
gate
this
beer
is
nearly
a
splitting
image
of
guinness
i
honestly
would
have
to
try
them
side
by
side
to
tell
the
apart
the
pour
is
a
milky
looking
brown
color
as
the
nitro
charges
the
beer
the
head
surges
to
the
top
making
a
tan
colored
creamy
looking
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
earthy
aromas
and
a
light
roasted
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
flavorful
but
with
some
of
the
roasted
malts
carrying
over
from
the
nose
and
some
of
the
earthy
peat
flavors
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
despite
the
color
overall
its
a
good
brew
to
try
i
think
worth
looking
into
o
actually
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
bad
but
not
especially
good
either
decent
beer
i
like
it
more
than
guinness
o
average
beer
in
my
books
nothing
special
but
something
to
try
if
only
for
that
look
of
the
cascading
bubbles
and
smooth
mouthfeel
o
as
far
as
irish
dry
stouts
go
murphys
is
pretty
good
this
might
sound
a
little
strange
but
this
would
make
a
pretty
good
lawn
mower
beer
as
its
fairly
refreshing
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
refreshing
dark
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
murphys
would
be
a
great
choice
o
i
dont
know
if
the
scores
bear
it
out
but
for
me
this
was
on
par
with
guinness
easily
drinkable
but
not
much
in
the
substance
of
it
for
me
good
while
out
on
the
town
but
not
a
goto
for
me
this
is
better
than
guiness
but
not
by
much
ill
stick
to
russian
imperials
thank
you
very
much
d
not
drinkable
for
me
i
would
definitely
look
for
a
different
stout
unless
you
want
a
less
tastyless
filling
stout
for
the
same
abv
you
can
get
much
richer
flavors
and
body
d
had
a
few
of
these
and
enjoyed
every
one
if
im
ever
at
another
spot
that
has
it
on
tap
id
grab
another
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
i
feel
this
beer
is
very
consistent
with
the
desired
style
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
for
many
occasions
and
foods
its
a
shame
this
one
is
not
on
tap
in
as
many
places
as
i
feel
it
should
be
as
i
drink
this
beer
more
and
more
i
find
that
there
is
substantially
more
creaminess
to
this
beer
than
to
a
guinness
guinness
is
creamy
and
everything
but
this
is
actually
getting
more
and
more
creamy
as
i
drink
it
this
affects
the
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
as
well
im
not
going
to
change
my
grades
but
still
thought
it
should
be
noted
o
i
think
this
is
an
above
average
beer
in
a
below
average
style
id
like
more
body
and
maybe
a
touch
more
sweetness
but
i
dont
want
to
knock
the
beer
too
hard
for
being
done
right
i
like
that
it
has
a
low
abv
but
i
would
take
an
english
dark
mild
over
this
every
day
of
the
week
overall
absolutely
comparable
to
and
some
might
argue
better
than
guinness
stout
i
for
one
would
be
one
to
argue
this
is
phenomenal
and
i
really
hope
i
can
find
it
on
tap
sometime
soon
by
the
way
let
me
take
this
opportunity
to
state
that
i
recognize
the
pub
draft
can
i
e
the
nitrocan
as
one
of
mankinds
greatest
inventions
i
put
it
right
up
there
between
penicillin
and
peanut
butter
anyone
else
out
there
remember
what
dry
stouts
in
the
usa
were
like
before
these
came
along
t
again
not
huge
at
all
but
not
terrible
roasted
malts
are
really
all
i
pick
up
until
a
thin
and
metallictasting
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
the
bodys
pretty
light
id
take
this
over
a
guinness
but
not
a
whole
lot
else
in
this
category
o
this
used
to
be
among
my
favorites
still
hard
to
beat
for
a
low
abv
drink
to
go
with
a
meal
more
pedestrian
than
in
my
youth
but
a
nice
drink
creamy
feel
on
this
the
carbonation
is
low
but
its
typical
for
a
nitro
beer
overall
nothing
really
great
here
i
got
this
because
my
first
beer
choice
was
kicked
its
servicable
and
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
not
a
bad
go
to
with
little
options
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
smooth
easy
drinking
irish
stout
at
4
this
is
a
very
nice
session
beer
that
is
a
nice
alternative
to
guiness
poured
black
with
a
light
tan
all
foam
head
that
remains
throughout
consumption
nose
was
dark
roast
malt
light
coffee
notes
and
mild
brewers
licorice
taste
was
light
flavoured
seemingly
flat
and
boring
licorice
dark
malts
but
remains
watery
and
unimpressive
mouthfeel
was
very
lite
and
thin
overall
a
weaker
effort
than
the
draft
guiness
thats
offered
in
chain
restaurants
here
good
abv
sessionable
but
thin
on
body
and
taste
overall
fairly
average
for
a
draught
irish
dry
still
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
overall
basic
irish
dry
here
in
fact
it
couldnt
get
anymore
basic
i
wish
this
was
more
robust
and
had
stronger
scent
to
it
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
o
the
lack
of
flavor
in
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
but
i
could
drink
this
one
again
the
two
may
share
similarities
but
there
are
reasons
why
i
never
order
guinness
yet
often
jump
at
the
chance
for
a
pint
of
murphys
where
its
offered
ive
added
my
two
cents
to
the
great
irish
stout
debate
citing
flavour
mouthfeel
and
quality
as
my
testimony
if
anyone
cares
to
rebuttal
id
be
happy
to
keep
arguing
over
another
few
rounds
the
can
widget
gives
it
an
almost
soap
bubblelike
foam
but
which
only
rises
to
about
14
dark
raw
umber
in
color
smell
is
malt
and
not
much
else
taste
is
a
very
mild
roasted
malt
quite
possibly
the
weakest
flavored
stout
ive
ever
had
hey
this
is
an
inoffensive
beer
which
even
people
who
dont
like
stout
could
probably
handle
because
frankly
there
just
isnt
much
stoutlike
about
it
besides
the
color
d
folks
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
fuller
than
expected
with
a
soft
roasted
malt
flavor
that
is
roasted
without
tasting
acridburnt
hints
of
toast
toffee
and
biscuit
while
being
slightly
smokey
subtle
notes
of
cocoa
toffee
and
hazelnut
nice
and
dry
but
a
bit
watered
down
with
a
bit
of
lactic
creaminess
adding
to
the
body
o
a
good
beer
that
has
great
drinkability
with
an
overall
mild
taste
i
really
must
do
a
side
by
side
next
time
im
able
to
get
murphys
and
a
guinness
on
tap
3
5
notes
a
slight
step
up
from
guinness
but
only
slight
more
to
offer
in
taste
than
guinness
draught
but
it
is
plagued
by
the
same
light
watery
body
if
you
are
looking
for
a
guinness
alternative
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
theres
still
much
better
out
there
step
aside
guiness
draft
murphys
is
a
superior
version
of
the
same
irish
session
beer
i
could
quaff
these
all
night
glad
i
found
the
less
known
cousin
from
county
cork
o
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
dry
stout
that
i
would
most
likely
purchase
over
other
more
popular
examples
at
4
with
a
thin
creamy
feel
dry
with
some
decent
flavor
youd
have
to
call
this
a
consummate
session
beer
great
for
when
you
want
a
stout
but
dont
feel
like
cracking
open
something
big
there
is
certainly
a
place
for
beers
like
this
in
my
drinking
repertoire
and
i
rate
it
accordingly
another
great
irish
stout
looks
smells
tastes
exceptional
was
a
little
disappointed
when
one
of
my
favorite
bars
stopped
serving
guinness
then
they
handed
me
a
murphys
and
i
had
nothing
to
complain
about
i
was
all
smiles
i
now
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
great
beer
i
had
some
delicious
corn
beef
cabbage
4
or
5
murphys
on
st
pattys
day
nothing
better
made
me
wish
i
was
irish
o
not
bad
and
it
is
something
different
from
the
usual
guinness
but
not
something
id
necessarily
go
back
to
when
i
popped
this
open
after
the
nitrous
fizz
cleared
i
gave
it
a
good
sniff
and
got
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
grain
i
took
the
first
sip
and
it
was
nice
and
creamy
mouth
feel
like
a
good
irish
stout
should
feel
i
let
it
sit
out
to
warm
it
up
a
little
because
i
do
hate
having
a
stout
to
cold
and
it
masks
the
flavor
so
during
that
first
sip
i
got
the
flavors
of
roasted
malts
and
grains
something
sweet
along
the
lines
of
maybe
a
little
caramel
or
syrup
but
for
the
most
part
a
milky
malty
beverage
this
beer
is
definitely
a
fullbody
almost
milkshakey
like
beverage
when
i
drink
these
i
like
to
enjoy
a
few
so
the
drinkability
is
there
either
a
sipper
or
a
kick
back
and
drink
type
of
beer
as
well
d
very
easy
to
drink
not
overly
complex
but
still
good
and
quite
solid
a
nice
session
beer
d
easy
to
have
a
few
but
then
the
taste
overwhelms
and
dries
the
tongue
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
is
above
other
irish
stouts
in
my
opinion
had
this
many
times
but
glad
to
give
it
another
run
overall
a
mixed
bag
i
enjoyed
the
look
and
flavor
while
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
were
lacking
for
me
not
bad
in
a
pinch
on
st
patricks
day
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
i
would
take
this
irish
dry
stout
over
guinness
any
day
of
the
week
but
it
is
too
thin
and
water
and
not
enough
flavor
to
fully
enjoy
although
on
the
plus
side
it
is
light
enough
that
i
can
drink
several
in
one
sitting
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
jet
black
coloring
with
a
solid
thick
creamy
two
fingers
beige
head
the
beer
has
a
creamy
nose
with
mocha
highlights
flavors
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
are
first
into
mouth
with
a
dark
coffee
bittering
effect
creamy
and
smooth
in
mouth
the
beer
has
a
semisweet
aftertaste
that
draws
you
back
for
repeated
drinks
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
mouth
and
the
light
finish
allows
for
repeated
drinking
delicious
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
easy
to
consume
in
mass
quantities
notes
would
pick
this
every
time
over
guinness
nitrocans
its
richer
in
the
midpalate
where
guinness
seems
to
have
more
acidity
d
great
drinkability
i
am
going
to
have
a
couple
of
these
tonight
no
problem
overall
not
as
sweet
as
guinness
pub
can
offering
but
id
like
a
little
more
roasted
malt
flavor
to
go
with
the
lovely
mouthfeel
you
could
slam
back
an
entire
four
pack
if
thats
your
thing
at
4
percent
abv
its
a
fine
alternative
to
guinness
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
more
distinctive
to
challenge
your
palate
well
victory
makes
a
fantastic
imperial
stout
really
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
feels
and
tastes
like
water
with
some
roasted
flavoring
looks
really
good
but
not
much
to
it
speaking
of
water
i
cant
believe
how
watery
the
texture
is
on
this
stout
i
understand
this
is
a
pedestrian
stout
but
i
do
remember
it
being
a
bit
more
meaty
and
a
bit
hearty
way
back
in
the
early
90s
alas
my
palate
has
been
tempered
with
a
vast
array
of
beefy
bruising
ales
in
the
past
20
years
but
i
still
cant
help
but
think
this
stout
has
been
wussified
i
still
will
quaff
these
when
i
return
home
after
slinging
back
a
few
celebrating
st
pattys
day
tomorrow
while
watching
my
spartans
play
ucla
in
the
first
round
of
the
ncaa
tourney
go
state
dwell
the
abv
and
the
taste
make
this
a
beer
that
i
can
drinker
more
of
than
almost
any
other
beer
its
just
great
i
first
had
this
a
long
time
ago
and
it
always
remains
a
beer
that
i
occasionally
fall
back
on
pours
a
small
half
finger
head
of
tan
creamy
looking
head
deep
black
with
some
dark
red
coming
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
smells
faintly
of
sweet
malts
slight
bit
of
alcohol
chocolate
iced
coffee
tastes
initially
sweet
and
malty
then
some
roast
malts
coffee
dark
chocolate
some
bitterness
and
maybe
some
sourness
the
finish
is
medium
dry
roasty
notes
linger
and
some
hop
bitterness
the
lingering
roasty
medium
dry
and
sourness
on
the
finish
is
kind
of
off
putting
medium
full
bodied
light
carbonation
i
think
this
fits
the
style
buy
not
my
taste
buds
i
wont
have
a
hard
time
finishing
one
pint
but
would
if
i
tried
another
one
overall
a
descent
beer
better
than
the
more
sour
guinness
7
a
four
pack
this
is
the
beer
that
guinness
was
supposed
to
taste
like
not
the
greatest
stout
ever
but
it
actually
has
a
good
taste
to
it
this
is
the
beer
ill
take
from
ireland
even
if
it
doesnt
look
as
good
when
its
poured
into
a
glass
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
not
extraordinary
but
quite
good
drinkability
finishes
fairly
long
but
with
a
moderate
bite
of
astringency
d
this
has
okay
drinkability
it
really
doesnt
taste
that
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
its
not
an
offensive
tasting
beer
its
just
not
very
flavorful
i
like
it
better
than
guinness
even
though
thats
not
saying
much
overall
i
dont
really
mind
drinking
this
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
the
nitrogenation
of
the
beer
produces
a
much
less
biting
texture
than
a
heavily
carbonated
beer
this
usually
allows
for
a
more
complete
realization
of
the
flavors
in
the
beer
it
feels
much
thicker
than
guinness
in
the
mouth
and
is
more
drinkable
to
me
overall
this
is
a
great
stout
and
a
nitro
can
that
should
be
tried
by
anyone
who
enjoys
guinness
but
doesnt
enjoy
the
sometimes
biting
acidity
of
carbonated
stouts
d
a
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
irish
stout
quaffable
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
hesitation
while
far
from
world
class
this
is
a
very
nice
departure
from
the
over
the
top
stouts
that
are
all
the
rage
in
todays
beer
scene
its
also
good
for
cooking
add
half
a
can
to
your
next
pot
of
chili
to
give
it
a
richness
that
you
cant
get
any
other
way
d
this
is
superiror
to
guiness
and
a
far
better
example
of
an
irish
stout
d
i
would
probably
prefer
this
over
guinness
nitro
by
a
slim
margin
overall
i
doubted
this
was
going
to
be
better
than
guinness
but
it
was
it
tastes
better
feels
better
and
is
smoother
it
is
delicious
and
i
plan
on
drinking
it
again
in
the
near
future
d
a
certainly
easy
sipper
and
with
loads
of
depth
on
guinness
a
clear
winner
between
the
two
from
notes
pours
deep
dark
brown
wa
lasting
creamy
velvety
smooth
light
biege
head
that
laces
well
lightly
roasty
and
chocolatey
w
a
moderate
nuttiness
and
bready
freshly
ground

of
sourness
in
the

smooth

w
lightly
coffee
roasty
flavor
and
nutty
wa
hint
of
burnt
coffee
in
the
finish
aftertaste
finish
is
lightly
dry
duh
its
a
dry
stout
some
light
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
sourness
from
dark
grains
velvety
smooth
mf
lighter
medium
body
low
carbonation
just
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
a
bit
less
flavorful
than
some
other
brands
but
still
a
good
solid
beer
great
session
beer
i
have
been
on
a
nitrocan
kick
as
of
late
not
sure
why
but
thats
neither
here
nor
there
lets
get
to
reviewing
the
murphys
irish
stout
purchased
locally
in
a
4
pk
containing
16
oz
nitrocans
yes
real
pints
unlike
guinness
and
the
lame
14
9
oz
can
they
use
one
up
for
murphys
here
pours
a
beautiful
cascade
of
black
and
tan
ultimately
settling
to
a
great
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
to
the
end
taste
is
definitely
another
one
up
on
guinnessroasted
barley
and
malt
some
chocolate
and
cream
just
a
hit
of
bitterness
very
good
coming
in
at
4
abv
this
is
a
real
lightweightbut
im
fine
with
that
i
can
sip
and
enjoy
a
few
of
these
over
an
evening
and
be
very
satisfied
given
the
choice
i
would
go
with
murphys
over
guinness
any
day
more
volume
more
flavor
more
real
overall
a
very
good
irish
stout
own
every
trademark
of
irish
stout
together
with
low
abv
it
is
easy
drinkable
without
doubt
overall
a
quite
good
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
fun
beer
id
have
another
one
drink
have
em
one
after
another
very
drinkable
d
this
is
quaffability
at
its
finest
lovely
rjt
16oz
tall
boy
can
pours
what
looks
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
with
a
good
sized
tan
head
tons
of
lacing
aromas
of
chocolate
coffee
a
hint
of
caramel
and
some
roasted
malts
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
roasted
malts
and
a
slight
coffee
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
creamy
beer
the
low
abv
drinking
it
chilled
and
the
smoothness
of
this
one
make
it
extremely
drinkable
underrated
brew
d
quite
easy
to
drink
because
while
its
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
presence
and
is
kind
of
muted
atmosphere
is
really
nice
deep
rich
intimidating
appearance
with
the
great
head
cascading
carbonation
throughout
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
not
complex
but
a
good
malty
character
with
some
peat
and
sweet
notes
flavor
also
not
complex
but
a
really
good
pub
draught
a
little
stout
and
a
little
dry
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
food
match
meat
pie
stews
casseroles
or
bangers
and
mash
with
a
nice
heavy
gravy
overall
this
stout
is
my
favorite
for
its
style
i
wont
buy
guinness
anymore
all
in
all
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
never
thought
i
could
be
this
happy
with
a
canned
beer
but
i
have
been
jovially
proven
wrong
definitely
worth
a
try
of
the
big
two
irish
stouts
this
is
the
more
flavorful
option
thats
not
saying
much
though
its
not
offensive
but
probably
nothing
id
actively
seek
out
either
a
rounded
stout
but
its
a
bit
dull
and
it
doesnt
hit
the
roasty
bitterness
that
would
make
this
pop
there
are
elements
in
this
one
that
are
done
well
but
none
that
have
my
running
back
to
it
for
more
especially
at
the
price
it
usually
draws
think
dark
speckled
hen
or
darker
boddingtons
compared
to
guinness
draught
this
is
much
more
flavorful
and
significantly
cheaper
by
the
case
i
think
guinness
is
a
tasty
beer
but
no
where
worth
the
hype
or
price
id
take
a
murphys
over
guinness
any
day
since
it
is
better
in
every
way
very
good
irish
stout
highly
drinkable
smells
of
roasted
malts
some
cocoa
and
coffee
in
their
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
had
4
pints
last
night
while
building
a
play
kitchen
for
my
daughter
nitro
can
is
16
ounces
vs
14
ounces
guinness
also
is
8
dollar
cheaper
for
a
case
drinkability
very
drinkable
isnt
too
thick
or
thin
bitterness
from
the
hops
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
not
a
bad
beer
this
beer
has
just
won
the
spot
of
beer
of
my
heart
the
way
it
cascades
upward
into
that
perfect
nitrogen
head
rises
equal
joy
in
my
being
its
aroma
is
a
bit
understated
but
is
still
as
comforting
as
a
childs
cup
of
hot
coco
the
flavor
is
where
this
stout
really
outshines
the
rest
its
as
is
someone
took
out
that
strange
undesirable
flavor
from
a
guiness
and
repaced
it
with
smooth
chocolate
esspeso
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
due
to
the
nitrogen
but
this
seems
to
enhance
the
drinkability
of
this
most
fulfilling
and
simultaniously
quaffable
stout
drinkability
my
first
revisit
to
my
goto
stout
from
college
has
only
confirmed
my
appreciation
of
this
beer
much
better
than
guinness
draught
easydrinking
and
arguably
the
best
tasting
beer
to
come
from
a
nitrocan
i
cant
help
but
think
what
if
a
us
craft
brewer
made
a
nitrocan
stout
oh
to
dream
i
also
used
for
a
black
and
tan
and
was
finally
successfulcan
said
draught
style
stout
but
i
think
it
is
the
same
as
this
beer
just
a
slightly
different
can
well
it
was
still
lacking
some
of
that
much
loved
body
it
did
have
more
than
the
nitrocans
do
when
drinking
this
out
of
a
can
i
like
to
crack
it
open
really
cold
then
let
it
breath
up
to
a
good
slightly
higher
than
normal
temperature
before
i
pour
and
drink
it
seems
to
make
it
taste
a
little
more
heavy
if
that
makes
any
sense
had
this
at
hurleys
irish
pub
in
montreal
really
felt
like
a
stout
none
of
the
brewpubs
were
open
yet
so
figured
this
would
do
pours
pitch
black
with
thick
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
at
all
lacing
all
around
the
glass
pretty
much
looks
like
youd
expect
with
a
nitro
stout
smells
of
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
really
nice
flavour
basically
like
a
guiness
with
more
flavour
very
creamy
mouthfeel
really
nice
stout
that
hit
the
spot
easy
to
drink
but
overall
a
fairly
mediocre
stout
pours
a
deep
blackish
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
some
great
lacing
smells
of
vanilla
and
roasted
barley
with
some
sweet
notes
tastes
of
vanilla
roasted
barley
a
little
sweetness
with
enough
bitterness
to
even
it
out
dry
finish
to
this
pretty
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
drinkability
overall
good
beer
and
glad
i
tried
it
would
be
interested
to
see
how
it
taste
in
a
can
i
can
see
myself
having
one
or
two
of
these
but
that
would
be
my
limit
drinkability
to
be
honest
i
dont
love
the
taste
i
like
the
smokiness
but
theres
also
a
staleness
not
to
weak
so
far
medium

i
really
enjoyed
this
and
could
put
a

down
easily
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
think
this
puts
guinness
to
shame
i
would
doubt
if
there
is
a
creamier
and
smoother
irish
stout
out
there
that
maintains
great
flavor
without
any
odd
flavors
or
aftertastes

but
this
is

and
low

id
prefer

stout
in
general
to
this
try
murphys
in
my
opinion
not
even
with
a
flashlight
very
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
as
with
most
of
the
well
known
irish
stouts
around
definitely
an
easy
beer
to
drink
as
it
is
soft
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
smooth
low
in
alcohol
so
you
could
probably
drink
it
all
night
without
becoming
too
inebriated
the
drinkability
is
also
high
so
you
should
have
no
problem
getting
through
a
few
definitely
worth

only
pick

just
a

more
than

it
would
be
very
interesting
to
try
both

the

reminded
me
of
that

not
a

has
a
very
good

retention

i
can

their

taste

not

pretty

not

finish
has

amount

nice

to

with

im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
nitrocans
but
this
is
better
than
most
the
beer
was
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
and
barely
and
head
because
of
my
dysfunctional
widget
dodad
light
malty
smell
along
with
toasted
grains
that
was
the
low
point
tastes
great
toasty
beer
which
was
relatively
light
on
malt
flavors
this
was
made
up
for
by
smokiness
perhaps
a
little
thin
body
and
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
otherwise
great
dry
finish
and
lingering
bitterness
it
starts
out
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
a
dark
brown
body
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
that
substantial
not
really
much
to
say
in
the
hop
department
however
i
can
say
that
it
is
a
good
session
beer
okay
okay
ill

it
im

a

set
this

it

left
excellent
lacing
beckoned
to
me
the
aroma
was
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
although
there
was
a
hops
presence
the
smell
did
not
elude
to
the
drawbacks
were
that
the
flavor
did
not
last
as
long
as
i
expected
and
there
was
not
near
the
dry
finish
that
i
expect
and
enjoy
could
have
been
too
cold
aside
from
these
points
it
is
an
excellent
beer
and
well
worth
the
money
to
try
is
it
better
than
guinness
i
dont
think
so
but
it
holds
its
own
a
very
good
stout
full
flavor
with
less
of
the
roasted
malt
aftertaste
of
a
guinness
very
easy
to
drink
not
as
complex
as
most
microbrewed
stouts
but
a
classic
nonetheless
i
had
the
can
version
i
was
a
little
unimpressed
with
this
one
as
far
as
a
comparison
with
guinness
i
thought
this
had
a
more
bitter
taste
and
a
thinner
body
any
points
gained
by
the
widget
were
lost
by
being
a
heineken
beer
just
get
a
guinness
can
or
beamish
can
if
you
have
the
choice
now
i
need
to
find
some
of
their
amber
not
quite
what
i
had
expected
for
an
irish
stout
this
one
was
a
bit
toned
down
it
was
not
as
creamy
and
thick
as
others
i
have
downed
however
its
somewhat
lighter
body
was
enjoyable
and
unique
id
get
it
again
my
review
for
this
beer
will
be
very
similar
to
the
review
of
steview
just
below
mine
the
pour
was
beautiful
from
the
nitro
can
but
i
was
surprised
that
the
head
wasnt
thicker
and
creamier
the
beer
wasnt
as
thick
as
expected
either
but
still
tasted
excellent
will
definitely
buy
this
again
its
an
excellent
stout
nitro
bottle
nice
jet
black
color
as
you
would
expect
but
the
head
on
this
one
was
very
thin
and
lacked
the
creamy
fluffy
fullness
that
the
other
nitros
produced
not
sure
if
this
is
good
or
bad
heavy
roasted
coffee
smells
more
than
guinness
nice
dry
flavor
on
the
finish
less
sweetness
on
the
finish
lacked
the
creamy
smoothness
of
the
guinness
nitro
overall
very
tasty
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
but
very
good
i
think
it
will
be
much
better
on
tap
the
nitro
co2
mix
facilitates
the
typically
dense
and
well
retained
beige
head
the
head
is
thicker
than
other
canned
nitro
irish
stouts
deep
garnet
in
color
and
very
clear
when
held
to
light
light
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
barley
sharpness
in
aroma
when
combined
with
the
subtle
and
pleasant
diacetyl
the
aroma
is
more
pronounced
than
nitro
can
guinness
flavorwise
murphys
is
soft
and
balanced
the
hop
and
roasted
unmalted
barley
bitterness
is
mild
for
style
but
residual
sweetness
is
low
as
expected
for
a
dry
stout
chocolate
malt
provides
complexity
and
makes
this
beer
bittersweet
overall
unfortunately
the
mouthfeel
and
body
was
a
bit
thin
murphys
finishes
clean
dry
w
lingering
roasted
grain
bitterness
its
a
decent
stout
for
sure
but
as
far
as
canned
nitro
stouts
go
beamish
remains
the
best
imho
deep
dark
black
similar
looking
to
guinness
but
not
quite
as
deep
dark
and
mysterious
extremely
smooth
like
drinking
a
cool
refreshing
milkshake
sweetness
adds
to
its
texture
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
pleasant
bitter
roasted
flavor
superior
to
guinness
in
my
opinion
weakish
flavoured
stout
slightly
watery
but
the
roasty
coffe
chocolate
flavour
is
there
its
decent
but
not
great
can
a
stout
smell
thin
aroma
lacks
the
richness
i
expect
from
a
stout
appearance
is
right
cascading
bubbles
from
the
nitro
widget
settling
into
a
nice
beige
head
on
top
of
a
blackruby
body
taste
is
fairly
blah
even
considering
it
is
a
nitro
can
balanced
and
smooth
to
a
fault
thinner
to
taste
than
i
remember
no
real
roastyness
can
indicates
now
brewed
at
whithead
uk
instead
of
in
cork
the
purchase
by
heineken
may
finally
be
taking
a
toll
on
this
fine
but
once
finer
stout
havent
had
the
guinness
version
of
this
yet
so
i
cant
make
the
comparison
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
this
was
decent
and
drinkable
i
typically
dont
care
for
the
astringency
that
nitro
widget
brings
to
the
beer
that
being
said
this
was
as
good
as
any
similarly
packaged
simulated
draught
beer
i
prefer
the
draught
version
the
best
nitrocan
out
there
imo
ive
had
it
ontap
once
and
i
feel
it
edges
guinness
just
a
bit
i
really
like
the
aroma
it
smells
sweeter
than
it
is
a
tadbit
thinker
than
guinness
nitrocan
creamy
fresh
34
inch
head
doesnt
cascade
downward
like
a
guinness
nitro
some
chocolate
hints
in
the
smell
extremely
smooth
and
with
a
taste
reminiscent
of
cream
itself
needs
more
of
a
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
and
more
bitter
mid
mouth
tastes
to
be
a
better
irish
stout
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
but
not
better
than
ok
to
fairly
good
a
good
draught
aromas
give
off
burnt
malt
and
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
the
same
aromas
can
be
tasted
on
the
palate
but
a
very
dry
finish
very
nice
creamy
milky
smooth
mouthfeel
and
overall
very
drinkable
very
comparable
to
guinness
at
least
thats
what
i
think
roofing
felt
black
running
out
of
descriptors
with
the
standard
widget
cascade
and
whipped
cream
head
a
flash
of
sweet
malt
turns
roasted
barley
immediately
ending
dry
tart
with
background
bittering
hops
normal
irish
stout
fare
wouldnt
bother
if
guinness
was
to
be
had
pours
a
beautiful
dark
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
roasted
malts
and
slight
burnt
chocolate
in
the
nose
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
roasted
malts
and
just
enough
burnt
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
a
nice
hop
bitterness
to
balance
everything
out
nice
and
drinkable
a
great
beer
all
in
all
i
have
never
had
this
on
draught
and
cant
wait
to
try
it
as
far
as
a
draught
can
goes
this
was
even
better
than
i
expected
55
this
beer
really
took
me
by
surprize
it
was
gorgeous
in
the
glass
pitch
black
against
a
pure
white
head
the
head
really
deserves
mention
frothy
bubbles
gives
it
a
real
draught
personality
very
elegant
however
its
other
characteristics
were
lacking
the
taste
was
hardly
stout
resembled
more
to
a
waterybeery
cappuccino
this
might
sound
bad
but
to
me
it
really
wasnt
would
have
liked
more
complexity
but
this
beer
remains
unique
in
its
own
right
extremely
mellow
i
dont
have
too
much
to
add
that
others
havent
said
but
it
deserves
better
than
guinnessguys
rating
down
there
so
ill
put
in
my
02
its
a
damn
smooth
irish
dry
stout
from
a
can
mighty
tasty
in
my
opinion
comparable
to
any
other
irish
stout
that
hides
its
flavour
behind
a
creamy
milky
nitroinduced
mask
they
might
not
have
the
marketing
muscle
of
guinness
but
still
worth
a
try
for
what
it
is
nice
and
creamy
one
of
my
favorites
the
used
to
be
a
crappy
little
restaurant
in
peabody
that
served
26
oz
drafts
of
murphys
now
it
has
turned
into
a
texmex
place
boy
do
i
miss
that
crappy
little
restaurant
very
satisfying
nice
and
creamy
and
tasty
too
excellent
stuff
here
though
not
quite
up
to
mackeson
xxx
milk
or
sam
smith
oatmeals
standard
i
liked
this
stouts
balance
fairly
creamy
at
the
front
but
finished
dry
typical
of
irish
stouts
overall
a
nice
lighter
bourbon
barrel
stout
a
little
hot
still
and
im
not
sure
the
body
can
suppor
the
barrel
aging
d
the
smell
is
wonderful
but
unfortunately
the
taste
is
merely
enjoyable
i
remember
liking
this
a
tad
more
a
few
months
back
when
a
growler
was
shared
late
one
night
at
the
hopleaf
still
its
another
fine
barrelaged
offering
from
3
floyds
that
id
gladly
have
again
its
a
medium
bodied
dark
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
a
creamy
one
finger
head
the
nose
consists
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
roast
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
and
is
really
smooth
and
well
integrated
the
flavors
mirror
the
aromas
its
really
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
barrel
esque
vanilla
it
has
great
flavor
actually
very
similar
to
the
elijah
craig
18yr
that
i
had
this
morning
this
beer
was
delicious
o
deeply
disappointed
i
shouldve
listened
to
the
two
people
dining
with
me
when
they
said
i
shouldnt
do
it
od
perhaps
had
they
mixed
in
a
portion
or
larger
portion
of
nonbal
aged
black
sun
this
would
have
been
better
or
some
time
aging
to
mute
the
alcoholwhiskey
notes
i
felt
it
was
overall
unbalanced
in
a
not
so
great
way
certainly
worth
a
try
though
and
for
those
that
like
the
whiskey
barrel
aspects
to
be
front
and
center
this
may
be
manna
for
them
overall
not
too
bad
wasnt
crazy
about
the
barrels
or
at
least
how
they
presented
themselves
in
this
beer
o
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
pretty
complex
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
just
wish
they
made
it
a
bit
thicker
which
would
have
made
it
exceptional
overall
a
solid
beer
i
was
glad
to
try
albeit
being
a
bit
pricy
at
9
for
a
smaller
pour
no
noticeable
alcohol
taste
or
warmth
would
i
drink
it
all
the
time
not
at
this
price
but
it
would
be
a
nice
splurge
rich
flavor
of
bakers
chocolate
woody
tobacco
vanilla
moderate
char
and
dry
oak
in
the
aftertaste
the
bourbon
element
was
just
right
and
well
integrated
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
mild
fudgy
sweetness
no
cherrytartness
as
mentioned
in
reviews
of
prior
batches
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
though
not
much
bigger
than
nonba
black
sun
easy
enough
to
drink
the
abv
wasnt
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
it
was
certainly
felt
fffs
answer
to
bcs
nice
stuff
good
beer
though
probably
the
best
bourbonbarrel
beer
ive
had
not
so
dominated
by
bourbon
flavors
as
most
of
them
seem
to
be
i
still
want
to
know
that
im
drinking
beer
and
the
bourbon
quality
here
is
just
right
not
sorry
i
had
the
beer
though
i
wouldnt
have
spent
9
bucks
for
a
tiny
glass
of
it
had
i
known
the
price
i
would
have
gotten
two
pints
of
the
moloko
milk
stout
for
the
same
price
as
my
friend
did
on
tap
at
fffs
brewpub
darkmuddy
in
appearance
right
off
the
bat
you
can
smell
the
bourbon
i
like
the
regular
black
sun
but
this
is
such
a
unique
brew
i
cant
help
but
prefer
it
over
the
regular
version
has
a
great
mix
of
sweetness
and
creamysmooth
taste
a
must
try
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
find
it
on
tap
overall
a
nice
beer
drank
only
one
and
i
thought
that
was
enough
definitely
a
sipper
on
tap
at
three
floyds
and
served
in
a
snifter
this
beer
poured
a
slick
oily
dark
brown
with
a
bubbly
head
of
dark
tan
foam
that
lasted
a
little
white
just
a
touch
of
slippery
lacing
was
left
behind
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
made
up
of
sweet
bourbon
notes
along
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
backbone
the
flavor
included
bourbon
wood
coffee
and
burnt
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
very
mild
carbonation
a
nicely
done
barrelaged
beer
the
bourbon
blends
in
nicely
with
the
original
beer
its
like
youre
drinking
three
beers
at
once
and
all
of
them
are
good
d
this
beer
has
a
smooth
but
big
wood
note
and
the
brightness
from
the
cherries
really
overpower
the
dry
stout
even
though
the
wood
is
big
it
is
not
as
overpowering
as
many
barrel
aged
beers
good
choice
of
barrel
and
fruit
but
more
malt
flavors
coming
through
would
really
be
nice
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
for
a
stout
and
for
a
beer
this
big
definitely
too
much
time
in
the
bourbon
barrel
less
time
or
a
new
oak
barrel
and
this
would
have
been
that
much
better
however
still
worthy
of
a
try
and
pretty
solid
d
one
of
the
nice
things
about
this
beer
is
that
youre
not
bowled
over
by
a
heavy
bourbon
presence
its
there
but
its
balanced
by
the
tart
cherries
a
pleasant
tartness
coupled
with
a
restrained
sweetness
and
a
low
alcohol
presence
considering
the
7
2
abv
make
this
one
quite
drinkable
i
really
liked
this
beer
thin

roasty

a
bit

for
the
style
but
that

stout
with
some
good
flavors
i
prefer
the
moloko

its
a
nice

that
has
enough
flavors
to
keep
things

it
pushes
the
bounds
of
a

a

with

it
was
a

a

good

although
less
distinct
in

than
some
of

that

the

its
so
much
more
than
that
i
get
oats
in

taste
its

rich

thick
to
not
have
oats
in
it
plus
its
sweet
and
creamy
it
yells
oats
it
also
has
some
bitterness
to
it
just
enough
though
one
thing
about
it
is
that
its
got
a
lot
of
body
a
lot
more
than
its
low
abv
would
suggest
most
of
the
time
its
heavy
even
though
it
isnt
sweet
uncommon
and
nice
for
winter
but
hard
to
drink
more
than
an
english
pint
of
this
its
filling
and
tiring
in
some
way
more
than
i
need
in
the

for
just
one
i

the

given
the

no
complaints
here
but
since
its
not
my
favorite
style
im
not

id
order
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
subdued
as
is
typical
of
the
style
but
absolutely
delicious
the
first
sip
was
very
mild
the
beer
was
served
too
cold
but
it
was
right
next
to
the
coors
light
tap
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
halfway
down
the
beer
reached
a
nice
temp
and
opened
up
nicely
light
bodied
it
had
a
nice
roasty
flavor
with
chocolatey
notes
and
just
a
hint
of
coffee
it
was
dry
but
not
as
dry
as
other
irish
stouts
i
have
tried
for
the
style
i
felt
it
was
very
flavorful
and
a
very
well
done
example
of
the
style
well
worth
a
taste
if
you
enjoy
the
dry
irish
stout
i
had
this
beer
at
societe
on
a
recent
trip
to
san
diego
the
abv
was
listed
as
5
2
on
the
board
the
beer
was
very
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
with
a
thin
whiteish
head
aroma
was
loaded
with
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
black
patent
malt
and
roasted
flavors
from
beginning
to
end
with
a
nice
dry
finish
i
also
drank
guinness
at
the
brewery
when
i
was
in
dublin
and
would
say
the
pugulist
is
a
better
example
of
an
irish
dry
stout
good
example
of
a
fairly
boring
style
pretty
good
i
dont
think
that
this
style
could
be
heavenly
but
its
aite
like
organic
cheddar
bunnies

the
labels
my
children

if
you
like
smoke
and
kilned
beers
and
youre
watching
your
wallet
this
is
your
ticket
its
definitely
not
the
best
stout
ive
tried
but
it
isnt
half
bad
im
not
sure
i
would
buy
it
again
as
theres
lots
of
other
stouts
out
there
that
do
the
job
better
than
this
but
for
a
macro
brewery
to
put
out
something
like
this
is
fairly
impressive
good
job
coors
its
actually
better
and
truer
to
traditional
stout
than
a
number
of
craft
stouts
ive
tried
recently
o
dont
let
the
coors
affiliation
steer
you
away
from
this
fine
irish
stout
overall
light
years
better
than
killians
irish
red
and
in
my
opinion
better
than
guinness
not
really
a
dry
stout
its
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
good
and
a
great
price
too
a
good
brew
from
millercoors
wow
never
thought
i
would
say
that
a
drinkable
yet
rather
forgettable
dry
stout
it
has
dark
grained
flavors
going
for
it
but
nothing
that
really
makes
it
stand
out
the
body
seems
rather
weak
and
could
use
more
body
definitely
fits
the
style
profile
but
doesnt
really
offer
anything
unique
yet
still
very
drinkable
i
recently
tried
killians
irish
red
was
not
overly
impressed
however
i
tried
killians
irish
stout
the
same
afternoon
and
i
was
seriously
impressed
to
me
it
had
hints
of
a
slightly
smoky
coffee
taste
but
that
only
added
to
the
overal
flavor
it
was
very
distinct
and
flavorful
every
sip
from
start
to
finish
maintains
a
good
body
with
no
nasty
aftertaste
it
was
good
overall
i
have
no
complaints
pours
dark
brown
with
onefinger
tan
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
mild
persistent
lacing
aroma
is
roasted
malts
mostly
coffee
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malt
some
coffee
bitterness
theres
a
hint
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
similar
to
what
you
can
get
with
an
oxidized
stoutporter
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
but
a
little
too
sweet
and
too
thin
to
be
a
great
dry
stout
taste
is
actually
quite
nice
i
am
a
little
surprised
and
impressed
rich
roasty
and
sweet
not
really
to
style
for
an
irish
dry
stout
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
is
tasty
im
still
pretty
shocked
this
killian
coors
product
is
this
good
i
would
take
this
over
a
guinness
for
sure
maybe
even
a
murpheys
or
beamish
too
pours
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
a
small
beige
head
good
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
perfect
carbonation
actually
for
this
one
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
was
the
same
and
actually
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
i
wasnt
sure
on
this
one
just
a
slight
bitterness
for
the
finish
but
didnt
linger
and
wasnt
over
done
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
as
far
as
taste
goes
it
is
similar
to
the
nose
and
feel
with
similar
traits
to
the
most
popular
imports
it
has
a
good
malt
body
but
is
like
the
feel
in
that
it
does
not
differentiate
itself
from
the
pack
it
has
good
flavor
but
is
not
bold
by
any
sense
the
mild
roast
and
mostly
dry
body
are
there
but
it
seems
to
flatten
as
it
warms
with
only
light
bitter
flavor
lasting
overall
i
consider
this
pretty
decent
for
the
style
it
represents
and
it
is
drinkable
with
good
flavor
and
aroma
i
would
buy
this
if
in
the
mood
for
a
dry
stout
but
there
are
others
i
would
prefer
like
many
other
posters
below
i
was
very
happily
impressed
and
surprised
with
this
millercoors
product
my
wife
even
said
its
not
as
bad
as
some

i
thought
this
was
decent
beer
and
it
was
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
the
style
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
a
little
more
then
a
guinness
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
as
a
good
starter
stout
all
in
all
i
didnt
think
this
beer
was
that
bad
at
all
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
watery
feel
overall
this
was
a
terrible
beer
the
darkest
and
most
expensive
glass
of
water
ive
ever
had
i
dont
know
why
people
seem
to
like
this
less
as
irish
stouts
go
this
is
a
winner
especially
on
the
nitro
tap
seen
a
few
handles
pop
up
for
saint
patricks
day
this
week
its
gorgeous
from
the
tap
lighter
than
guinness
in
color
but
with
a
similar
head
on
it
the
nose
is
light
i
smell
the
dank
irish
yeast
before
i
smell
anything
else
wet
and
musty
and
old
in
a
good
way
like
the
weather
there
the
malt
is
really
light
for
its
color
almost
no
body
at
all
to
this
i
remember
it
being
fuller
for
whatever
reason
but
it
seems
really
really
thin
this
go
around
its
creamy
from
the
nitro
but
its
almost
watered
down
in
feel
not
palate
coating
at
all
at
such
a
light
body
and
low
abv
this
is
a
beer
you
could
just
pound
on
all
day
and
i
probably
would
if
i
was
part
of
the
downtowny
kegs
and
eggsy
crowd
but
thats
just
not
me
not
much
flavor
to
it
i
mean
its
like
a
hlaf
a
stout
its
good
no
off
tastes
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
like
roast
without
substance
which
actually
is
kind
of
confusing
and
pleasant
milky
feeling
and
super
dry
i
think
its
made
well
in
that
regard
and
offers
a
nice
alternative
to
the
obvious
when
thats
the
kind
of
beer
you
want
to
drink
i
have
no
issues
with
this
at
all
and
apparently
like
it
a
lot
better
than
others
have
strange
on
the
palate
to
have
it
be
so
light
but
so
creamy
and
thick
at
the
same
time
its
thick
and
thin
cant
think
of
many
other
beers
that
do
that
goes
down
so
smooth
like
chocolate
milk
isnt
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
solid
irish
dry
stout
light
body
watery
really
perky
effervescence

pretty
solid
copy
of

what
that
is

0313
on

at

nyc
just
ok
got
a
tad
bitter
at
the
end
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
bad
but
a
tiny
bit
bland
o
pretty
decent
overall
once
again
a
surprising
level
of
bright
bitterness
not
much
malt
in
support
however
theres
a
bit
of
a
berry
taste
to
the
deeply
roasted
malts
this
would
be
a
mellow
dry
stout
for
the
irish
its
good
but
certainly
not
bold
flavor
wise
some
cream
the
body
is
neutral
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
high
for
a
nitro
o
an
easy
drinking
session
stout
especially
on
nitro
tap
as
that
makes
the
body
lighter
and
creamier
nice
complexity
of
flavors
without
a
heavy
amount
of
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
delightful
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
any
lovers
of
stout
had
this
on
tap
at
the
liberty
bar
on
west
35th
street
in
manhattan
it
was
the
tale
of
2
beers
initially
i
had
thought
that
i
got
a
poor
pour
as
the
brew
had
barely
settled
by
the
time
it
was
presented
to
me
and
had
a
huge
head
about
14
of
the
glass
in
retrospect
the
pour
was
the
best
part
not
only
did
it
look
fantastic
with
the
light
brown
head
contrasted
with
the
dark
very
dark
brown
body
but
the
head
was
the
best
tasting
part
as
well
i
always
enjoy
a
nice
thick
head
especially
when
it
comes
to
stouts
this
did
not
dissapoint
in
that
area
it
was
thick
and
creamy
and
extremely
tasty
head
with
dark
notes
of
chocolatecoffee
sweetness
coming
through
it
was
particularly
nice
once
i
broke
through
the
head
to
get
to
the
actual
brew
which
when
paired
with
the
head
in
a
single
sip
was
a
very
pleasant
experience
unfortunately
thats
where
it
ended
once
the
head
was
gone
and
i
was
left
with
only
body
it
turned
itself
into
a
thin
and
average
tasting
stout
the
taste
has
some
malt
roastiness
but
fits
the
style
with
low
sweetness
in
the
flavor
adding
some
depth
with
a
light
yeast
quality
with
some
mineral
dryness
into
the
finish
overall
i
enjoyed
this
pretty
decent
dry
stout
suitable
for
sessioning
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
guinness
alternative
for
brewpub
patrons
but
fits
the
style
well
the
body
is
on
par
for
nitro
finishes
dry
and
helps
that
roasty
black
malt
note
that
comes
out
silky
feel
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
nitro
but
this
is
pretty
really
good
overall
malt
comes
out
despite
the
nitro
would
like
a
bit
cleaner
and
more
bodydepth
this
is
a
super
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
that
silky
smooth
nitro
feel
but
this
is
very
watery
in
the
feel
even
by
irish
stout
standards
it
is
lacking
quite
a
bit
in
body
and
character
but
was
a
pleasant
unique
offering
that
i
would
probably
have
again
oa
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
very
watery
sadly
not
better
than
gunniess
not
bad
though
o
this
is
an
average
brew
to
me
it
is
very
drinkable
for
sure
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
taste
that
grabs
me
and
wants
me
to
drink
more
not
bad
but
not
memorable
since
its
on
nitro
aromatics
were
quite
light
but
i
definitly
could
smell
roasted
malts
and
anise
taste
was
bold
and
smooth
with
a
good
creamy
texture
a
desent
malt
backbone
greets
you
with
a
gentle
puckering
in
the
aftertaste
ive
been
jones
for
this
brew
quite
a
while
and
was
worthy
of
the
wait
a
little
disappointing
right
from
the
start
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
a
weak
little
tan
head
that
lacked
the
creaminess
and
cascading
beauty
of
a
typical
nitro
pour
bad
line
otherwise
typical
dark
opaque
brownblackitude
of
an
average
stout
aroma
of
dark
malts
notes
of
coffee
and
a
dab
of
solvent
similar
taste
roasty
dark
malts
touches
of
coffee
and
chocolate
mild
and
a
bit
thin
in
body
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
to
write
a
review
about
doh
an
excellent
representative
of
the
irish
dry
stout
style
and
im
very
glad
i
tried
it
when
i
had
the
chance
overall
even
though
this
was
not
on
nitro
i
believe
it
was
still
quite
a
good
session
stout
worth
the
3
bucks
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
and
bitter
earthy
hops
with
a
light
roastiness
charred
malt
and
a
surprisingly
smoky
flavor
approaching
a
rauch
style
what
was
merely
hinted
at
in
the
nose
emerges
prominently
in
the
tasting
finishes
quite
dryly
moderately
thin
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
very
creamy
goes
down
extremely
easily
quite
a
good
take
on
an
irish
dry
stout
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
stout
to
drink
for
a
while
from
notes
52512
o
i
have
yet
to
fall
in
love
with
this
style
and
this
beer
is
yet
another
setback
i
feel
like
the
nitro
version
of
these
stout
just
come
off
as
a
little
too
subtle
with
a
rather
watery
mouthfeel
as
well
ill
keep
trying
but
i
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
irish
stout
i
have
ever
had
much
props
to
the
great
brewers
at
victory
taste
is
smooth
with
some
very
nice
tobacco
and
licorice
notes
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
somewhat
watery
and
light
but
true
to
the
style
drinkability
its
decent
for
such
a
simple
stout
but
not
something
id
return
to
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
a
nice
irish
dry
stout
but
overall
its
underwhelming
if
it
were
st
pattys
i
could
see
me
putting
in
work
on
this
beer
otherwise
ill
pass
overall
not
great
way
too
light
very
little
malt
or
stout
flavors
at
all
thin
and
watery
and
what
there
is
for
flavor
is
overpowered
by
the
nitro
at
least
i
can
drink
this
like
chocolate
milk
and
pound
it
m
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
relatively
moist
finish
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
very
impressive
reversecascading
mocha
head
and
good
retention
the
nose
carries
some
very
light
roast
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
nothing
too
complex
but
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
flavor
falls
a
bit
flat
after
the
nose
with
just
a
bit
of
roast
and
not
much
else
medium
body
with
a
nice
nitro
feel
pretty
good
though
below
victory
standards
for
me
taste
was
great
a
light
roasted
barley
and
charcoal
with
hint
of
dry
dark
chocolate
light
woody
bitterness
to
balance
a
very
light
sweetness
it
had
nice
wellrounded
body
and
a
great
solid
feel
esp
for
such
low
abv
etc
outstanding
in
every
aspect
this
dry
stout
coming
in
3
7abv
is
everything
i
could
ever
want
for
this
style
very
high
whole
hop
flavor
ekg
i
assume
for
style
without
the
typical
roasted
malt
bitterness
normally
present
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
offering
from
victory
they
are
my
darling
east
coast
brewery
and
they
should
be
yours
too
great
smooth
carmely
roasty
finish
good
drinkability
that
one
would
not
guess
from
the
sheer
blackness
which
is
not
pitch
black
but
the
darkest
of
dark
brown
o
one
of
the
better
dry
stouts
i
have
had
not
an
ovely
complext
beer
but
a
great
session
beer
o
cant
complain
good
irish
dry
stout
honestly
havent
had
many
but
guinness
but
this
one
doesnt
dissapoint
i
enjoy
it
more
than
guinness
well
done
victory
this
beer
pours
with
the
characteristic
cascading
head
of
a
nitro
tap
it
is
a
bit
light
around
the
edges
though
which
is
not
too
great
aroma
is
mildly
roasty
with
a
nice
little
bit
of
coco
pretty
nice
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
the
coco
comes
out
s
bit
more
with
a
mild
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
pretty
on
point
for
the
style
maybe
a
bit
more
dryness
but
is
good
nonetheless
with
the
creaminess
from
the
nitro
pretty
good
enjoyable
approachable
stout
a
simple
undefined
uninteresting
dry
stout
this
beer
poured
out
like
a
guinness
the
surge
took
a
little
while
to
finish
the
head
is
creamy
and
thick
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
deep
brown
the
smell
is
light
not
much
on
the
nose
just
a
slight
roasted
aroma
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
has
a
nice
light
chocolatey
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slick
nitro
makes
this
brew
very
smooth
oveall
its
a
good
dry
stout
typical
for
the
style
really
nice
back
to
trivia
before
they
were
stars
i
suck
at
this
but
i
just
won
a
free
beer
for
knowing
its
abv
the
fastest
beeradvocacy
proves
good
for
something
o
great
stout
im
glad
its
on
tap
12
a
block
from
my
house
very
drinkable
very
smooth
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
d
this
one
is
ubersessionable
as
this
one
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
into
3
7
abv
great
appearance
with
nice
flavor
and
aroma
all
while
being
able
to
drink
several
glasses
another
nice
job
by
the
folks
at
victory
im
shocked
it
took
me
so
long
to
sample
this
is
a
session
stout
all
the
way
nice
to
have
such
from
victory
with
out
the
usual
extra
hop
profile
dark
beautiful
pour
settled
into
a
classic
creamy
nitro
head
great
aroma
of
roast
grains
hint
of
coffee
and
cocoa
taste
of
the
same
slight
sweetness
and
all
at
3
7
nice
to
have
a
stout
with
lunch
and
not
feel
wiped
out
afterwards
very
drinkable
wish
i
could
find
this
more
often
note
for
nitpickers
this
is
indeed
less
than
4
and
i
do
mean
id
like
to
see
more
4abv
beers
like
this
taste
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
phenomenal
very
toasty
and
a
bit
grainy
no
hoppiness
but
perfect
for
the
style
surprising
good
o
overall
a
real
let
down
the
watery
nature
of
it
just
ruined
the
beer
for
me
o
in
the
old
drinkability
category
this
would
get
a
solid
4
5
overall
its
a
good
beer
i
think
the
serving
style
is
hampering
the
impact
of
the
flavours
give
me
this
on
cask
or
even
regular
draft
and
allow
the
flavours
to
come
out
more
that
being
said
its
still
a
very
easy
drinking
pint
but
theres
not
a
lot
to
differentiate
it
from
guinness
at
this
point
very
light
taste
drinks

overall

i
love
irish

but
this
one
doesnt
quite
hit
the
spot
i
had
this
on
nitro
at
the
brew
pub
today
the
pour
is
jet
black
with
a
full
fluffy
tan
head
the
aroma
had
some
chocolate
and
roasted
notes
the
flavor
is
roasted
malts
and
has
a
light
dry

the
body
is
mediumlight
and
well
carbonated
very
easy
drinking
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
low
in
abv
i
prefer
other
irish
stouts
but
this
is
not
bad
ultra
smooth
feel
with
a
much
fuller
body
than
you
might
expect
very
pleasant
on
the
tongue
easy
drinking
and
super
low

making
it
extra
sessionable
instead
of
turning
this
into
a
watery
thin
boring

victory
preserved
the
body

and
flavor
nice
d
easily

a
true
session
beer
that
i
wish
was
more
commonly
found
in
area
bars
drinkability
i
like
stouts
i
like
irish
dry
stouts
but
this
one
falls
flat
for
me
victory
can
brew
much
better
beer
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
its
mild
but
still
enjoyable
and
very
refreshing
d
i
enjoyed
this
irish
dry
stout
a
lot
i
agree
that
its
a
bit
of
a
guinness
clone
though
a
little
watered
down
version
either
way
i
enjoy
guinness
and
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
was
looking
for
a
session
beer
served
to
me
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
and
the
cascading
effect
from
the
nitro
was
on
full
display
color
was
black
and
beautiful
smell
was
very
heavy
on
the
roasted
side
charred
wood
and
subtle
notes
of
coffee
hazelnut
and
chocolate
alot
of
dry
and
bitter
tannins
are
quickly
evident
on
the
tongue
roasted
coffee
and
woody
flavors
not
very
complex
but
an
enjoyable
palate
overall
mouthfeel
isnt
as
creamy
as
i
expected
and
finishes
very
thin
drinkability
is
hampered
a
little
by
the
lack
of
complexity
in
the
flavors
which
actually
got
a
bit
tiresome
not
a
terrible
attempt
at
a
dry
session
stout
but
not
a
great
one
either
much
better
than
i
had
expected
as
i
am
not
a
typical
stout
drinker
this
ones
good
served
from
nitrotap
into
a
standard
pint
pours
an
almost
black
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
maintains
decent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
earthy
and
nutty
notes
the
flavor
is
of
light
malt
and
nutty
notes
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
i
was
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
wasnt
bad
for
a
low
abv
stout
but
not
good
for
being
considered
a
stout
basically
everything
needs
to
be
a
little
more
robust
on
this
one
and
amplified
mfd
creamy
smooth
carbonation
was
a
tiny
bit
prickly
but
otherwise
enjoyable
i
like
it
if
it
came
in
bottles
around
here
id
buy
it
over
guinness
id
prefer
a
good
local
example
but
its
certainly
worth
a
try
drinkability
probably
the
best
irish
stout
i
have
had
d
goes
down
very
easy
quite
tasty
nice
representation
of
style
damn
tasty
and
with
the
abv
on
this
one
i
could
drink
it
all
night
d
drinking
this
beer
is
a
breeze
it
is
a
good
beer
to
session
if
you
are
looking
for
a
stout
with
a
lot
of
flavor
i
really
like
the
fact
that
victory
took
on
the
traditional
irish
dry
stout
and
puts
its
own
twist
on
the
formula
the
dryness
is
still
there
as
is
the
drinkability
yet
a
new
hint
of
sweetness
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
style
d
this
is
a
simple
balanced
beer
that
one
could
easily
drink
all
night
it
is
characterized
by
a
flat
roasted
note
similar
to
that
of
cheap
coffee
but
this
darkness
is
enhanced
by
a
depth
of
chocolate
and
a
light
nuttiness
that
make
it
much
more
enjoyable
than
the
more
ubiquitous
examples
of
the
style
my
goto
session
beer
whenever
i
visit
victory
donnybrook
never
disappoints
low
abv
doesnt
mean
no
taste
it
has
a
roasty
flavor
that
doesnt
cross
over
into
smokiness
decent
mouthfeel
and
consistently
good
flavor
sadly
needs
nitro
so
i
cant
take
home
my
growler
filled
with
this
i
actually
had
the
bartender
check
to
make
sure
there
wasnt
anything
wrong
with
the
tap
or
keg
he
did
and
said
cant
notice
anything
wrong
just
a
bummer
beer
his
words
but
ill
stand
by
them
this
beer
is
nearly
flavorless
poured
inky
black
with
a
healthy
lightbrown
head
that
held
all
the
flavor
sipping
through
the
head
i
got
hints
of
a
semblance
of
roasted
nutty
malt
from
there
on
it
tastes
like
watereddown
guinness
this
beer
is
thin
watery
boring
and
offensive
for
those
reasons
not
sure
what
niche
victory
was
going
for
with
this
one
its
not
enjoyable
for
beer
geeks
at
beer
bars
its
not
familiar
enough
for
the
lawnmower
crowd
and
who
on
earth
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
waterguinness
for
a
fireside
or
front
porch
session
truly
a
bummer
beer
drinks
easy
though
dark
with
a
creamy
head
from
the
nitro
tap
smells
of
light
roasted
barley
its
the
smell
of
st
pattys
day
to
me
taste
is
wonderful
very
light
bodied
and
clean
roastiness
obviously
similar
to
guinness
but
a
much
better
beer
imo
very
light
and
drinkable
and
at
3
7
it
wont
get
you
shit
faced
any
time
soon
easy
easy
drinker
didnt
realize
it
was
so
light
in
abv
when
i
had
it
tastes
a
bit
stronger
than
4
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
letting
just
a
touch
of
light
through
weak
thin
stip
of
khaki
colored
head
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
sweetened
condensed
milk
and
roasted
nuts
taste
follows
scent
with
a
sweet
creamy
roasted
grains
and
nuts
charachter
body
is
very
chalky
and
dry
and
lacks
carbonation
not
very
pleasent
in
the
mouth
decent
flavor
but
not
a
very
pleasing
body
makes
for
a
beer
that
could
be
much
better
then
it
is
d
high
on
taste
and
low
on
alcohol
this
beer
gets
it
done
better
than
guiness
i
feel
thumbs
up
to
victory
again
for
this
delicious
beer
my
vote
for
the
best
irish
stout
even
better
than
the
original
from
ireland
drink
is
excellent
i
would
recommend
if
you
are
a
stout
lover
and
love
to
drink
it
in
session
then
this
is
your
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
minor
lace
a
good
smell
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
a
little
oakey
or
woody
as
well
a
sweet
smooth
real
creamy
medium
body
that
is
a
little
chewey
with
a
malty
taste
chocolate
roasted
a
little
coffee
and
even
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
caramel
with
a
very
minor
dry
finish
a
very
sessionable
stout
as
the
malts
are
very
subdued
although
after
a
while
it
could
get
boring
sure
worth
a
try
though
poured
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
two
fingers
of
beige
head
that
laced
very
well
the
smell
was
bitter
yet
mild
with
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
powder
the
tasted
was
a
little
more
intense
than
the
aroma
with
a
nice
dry
finish
the
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
was
exceptionally
creamy
with
a
pleasant
dry
bitter
finish
exceedingly
sessionable
i
actually
thought
the
nitro
hurt
this
one
being
so
mild
to
begin
with
it
would
have
been
more
flavorful
on
standard
co2
an
outstanding
session
beer
but
not
all
that
outstanding
otherwise
d
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
but
its
mild
aromas
and
flavors
could
get
bland
and
boring
after
a
pint
this
was
the
lightest
beer
offered
at
victry
brewing
on
8709
an
enjoyable
one
to
say
the
least
this
stout
poured
black
with
brown
foam
that
persisted
the
smell
was
of
coffee
grounds
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
was
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
sweet
fruit
a
touch
of
cocoa
and
very
light
caramel
and
coffee
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
with
medium
body
but
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
the
carbonation
was
smooth
this
was
a
smooth
easy
drinking
dry
stout
the
pour
was
nice
enough
very
dark
brown
basically
black
with
no
light
shining
through
on
this
one
at
all
rich
looking
head
of
tan
on
the
top
hung
around
for
most
of
the
session
the
aroma
was
a
bit
light
lots
of
roasted
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
cocoa
underneath
it
really
dry
taste
but
a
little
bland
for
me
light
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
but
it
lacked
alot
of
depth
to
put
it
over
the
top
into
another
cateogory
still
though
it
was
a
decent
little
stout
with
a
nice
feel
and
a
3
5
percent
very
drinkable
not
sure
i
would
go
here
again
though
dont
drink
and
review
this
one
didnt
do
much
for
me
poured
from
the
tap
to
a
dark
brown
with
medium
tan
head
that
lingered
awhile
and
left
okay
lacing
nose
and
taste
were
botrh
a
faint
chocolate
malt
and
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
flat
and
watery
at
only
3
7
abv
there
was
no
noticeable
alcohol
and
the
finish
was
short
and
nondescript
had
on
tap
at
rustico
in
alexandria
va
poured
into
a
pint
glass
opaque
and
black
with
an
inch
of
creamy
tan
head
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
remained
through
the
course
of
the
pint
didnt
get
much
in
the
way
of
aromas
but
the
taste
was
pleasant
enough
dry
and
roasty
reminiscent
of
guinness
but
a
tad
drier
id
drink
it
again
this
is
a
decent
dry
stout
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
a
disappointing
dry
stout
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
guiness
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
it
may
be
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
its
a
style
that
is
a
waste
of
time
imho
i
was
dissapointed
and
chugged
this
one
down
very
quickly
so
i
could
move
on
to
beers
that
have
3
times
the
flavor
and
alcohol
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
nearly
opaque
reddish
sable
with
a
thick
fairly
persistent
tan
head
aroma
is
richly
of
roast
coffee
and
has
just
a
hint
of
cinnamon
flavor
is
surprisingly
spicy
and
has
a
strong
hoppy
component
rather
different
from
other
stouts
i
have
tasted
it
has
firm
coffee
and
smoke
components
as
well
plus
a
tiny
metallic
tinge
but
the
last
may
come
from
this
particular
batch
texture
is
tingly
and
sharp
and
just
a
teeny
bit
thin
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
fine
from
a
low
abv
sessiontype
standpoint
but
being
so
devoid
of
flavor
i
doubt
itd
hold
my
interest
beyond
the
one
pint
drinkability
with
the
low
alcohol
and
the
low
bitterness
this
could
definitely
be
a
session
beer
especially
on
a
rainy
blustery
evening
overall
this
is
a
good
irish
stout
im
still
not
100
sure
if
it
was
a
normal
tap
or
if
nitrogen
was
used
but
judging
from
the
carbonation
it
seemed
like
a
normal
tap
this
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
i
liked
it
keep
the
glass
night
at
flying
saucer
served
a
typical
jetblack
with
the
usual
foamy
nitro
head
because
it
was
keep
the
glass
night
mine
and
many
others
had
been
poured
in
advance
so
i
was
not
able
to
enjoy
the
waterfall
effect
as
the
head
slowly
diminished
only
spotty
lacing
was
left
on
the
glass
aroma
was
the
usual
roasted
malts
just
not
quite
as
abundant
as
i
hoped
for
taste
was
pretty
much
textbook
for
the
style
as
was
the
mouthfeel
crisp
carbonation
and
a
smooth
dryness
this
is
what
it
is
a
good
american
made
alternative
to
guinness
drinkability
beats
the
pants
off
guinness
low
in
abv
and
unusually
flavorful
for
the
style
a
style
i
normally
dont
care
too
much
for
this
ones
pretty
dark
sessionable
though
mild
and
tasty
not
quite
as
dry
as
most
idss
but
thats
alright
with
me
gives
it
character
i
say
d
very
a
very
sesisonal
stout
in
a
world
of
overimperialization
overall
this
was
a
nice
basic
dry
stout
and
hit
the
spot
on
a
cold
night
i
would
check
this
out
again
if
for
nothing
else
that
the
mf
was
superb
on
top
of
a
pretty
decent
flavor
in
the
end
it
was
another
nice
light
dry
and
roasted
irish
dry
stout
it
wasnt
too
dry
or
too
roasted
it
was
just
good
if
i
saw
this
again
on
nitro
tap
i
might
order
it
again
it
smells
like
suede
tastes
like
if
you
licked
my
purse
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
earthy
black
malt
aroma
its
light
and
creamy
a
nice
irish
stout
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
very
smooth
black
malt
flavor
with
a
dry
earthy
finish
thats
a
bit
thin
and
creamy
its
very
easy
drinking
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
irish
stout
its
true
to
style
and
loaded
with
flavor
another
winner
from
victory
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
nice
heavy
full
mouthfeel
makes
this
brew
incredibly
satisfying
very
good
d
this
lasted
maybe
8
minutes
in
my
glass
a
stout
i
really
enjoyed
mainly
due
to
the
drinkability
i
had
this
on
nitrotap
at
deep
ellum
back
in
early
june
nitrotaps
are
not
usually
my
thing
but
occasionally
it
will
work
really
well
with
a
stout
this
stout
is
perfect
for
that
treatment
light
and
very
creamy
the
nitro
just
accentuates
what
makes
this
beer
so
drinkable
in
the
first
place
pours
black
with
a
creamy
thick
head
and
great
lacing
smells
creamy
and
a
bit
nutty
the
taste
is
quite
nutty
with
a
rich
creaminess
and
subdued
cocoa
notes
delicious
and
so
easy
to
drink
you
almost
want
to
chug
it
which
i
would
never
do
of
course
one
of
the
reasons
i
score
this
so
high
is
that
it
is
so
sessionable
such
low
alcohol
beers
are
hard
to
find
in
the
u
s
and
this
one
sacrifices
not
a
whit
of
flavor
the
its
overall
character
may
not
be
hugely
pronounced
or
anything
i
still
find
it
very
impressive
that
you
get
as
much
as
you
do
for
a
sub
4
beer
i
was
also
happy
to
find
that
the
body
packed
a
bit
more
beef
than
a
lot
of
other
crappy
irish
stouts
on
the
market
and
with
that
easygoing
feel
i
could
session
this
all
night
definitely
a
great
lower
abv
alternative
form
victory
a
super
easy
drinker
and
if
the
ba
listing
is
true
and
its
less
than
4
a
fine
session
drinker
is
what
weve
got
here
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
shows
a
touch
of
ruby
when
held
to
light
head
is
creme
the
nose
is
fairly
roasted
its
onedimensional
but
still
fairly
firm
flavor
carries
pretty
much
the
same
roasted
and
thats
really
about
it
it
isnt
overdone
at
all
as
ive
had
a
lot
of
ridiculously
roasted
brews
its
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
the
carbonation
is
biting
as
well
and
the
liquid
is
good
overall
its
a
nice
fairly
easy
drinking
brew
between
the
bite
of
carbonation
and
the
roasted
aspects
it
might
turn
some
beer
wimps
off
but
i
think
its
nice
deasy
drinking
to
say
the
least
a
welcome
chage
of
pace
from
the
typical
american
stout
probably
the
second
best
dry
irish
stout
i
have
had
a
totally
sessionable
stout
that
does
not
overwhelm
drinkability
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
sessionable
beer
not
heavy
easy
to
quaff
and
low
alcohol
make
this
a
great
beer
to
drink
all
day
long
d
a
good
all
around
stout
id
take
it
over
a
guinness
for
a
change
in
scenery
mostly
black
with
lighter
reddish
edges
and
a
thin
light
tan
head
a
lightly
roasted
malt
nose
with
a
small
bit
of
coffee
flavors
of
burnt
malt
coffee
notes
with
a
little
lactic
tang
similar
to
guinness
the
body
was
light
to
medium
with
a
roasty
grainy
thin
finish
i
like
the
fact
that
they
aimed
for
a
low
gravity
stout
in
the
classic
fashion
but
there
needs
to
be
some
work
on
the
body
something
a
little
more
creamy
or
heck
put
it
through
the
nitro
tap
im
not
the
pro
here
overall
i
was
very
impressed
and
must
give
another
hats
off
to
victory
for
pushing
the
envelope
even
if
in
the
otehr
direction
the
beer
poured
a
deep
rubyblack
with
a
thick
tan
head
nitrogas
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
chocolateroasted
malt
aroma
a
beautiful
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
luscious
chocoloate
and
roastedtoasted
malt
flavor
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
an
excellent
stout
a
smoother
version
of
guinness
in
my
opinion
great
carbonation
and
lacing
too
d
a
low
alcohol
irish
stout
that
tastes
better
than
the
imports
a
nice
fresh
stout
hard
to
beat
6
oz
taster
glass
at
rustico
alexandria
va
great
job
by
victory
i
would
buy
another
barrell
anytime
a
very
well
done
irish
dry
stout
almost
like
guinness
done
right
d
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
with
great
flavor
an
ease
of
drinkablity
and
a
nice
low
abv
very
well
done
it
began
with
about
a
halfafinger
of
deep
tan
head
with
decent
retention
above
an
utterly
black
liquid
the
nose
had
a
mildly
smoky
quality
the
mouthfeel
had
a
very
pleasant
silky
quality
and
a
chocolatycharcoaly
flavor
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
the
return
of
the
dry
smoky
bitterness
that
i
had
noted
on
the
nose
good
lacing
throughout
i
found
this
on
tap
at
a
fairly
new
bar
called
slainte
in
philly
across
the
street
from
30th
street
station
it
was
delivered
to
me
in
an
odd
looking
kind
of
small
imperial
pint
glass
that
im
guessing
was
actually
more
of
an
american
pint
at
around
16
ounces
despite
the
small
glass
it
had
a
beautiful
appearance
very
much
like
guinness
but
with
a
just
slightly
darker
head
and
a
tiny
bit
less
lacing
which
could
have
been
from
the
glass
itself
other
than
that
it
was
almost
exactly
like
guinness
which
its
obviously
what
its
trying
to
be
or
at
least
thats
what
the
bar
keep
told
me
that
it
was
brewed
specially
for
the
irish
pub
because
they
dont
serve
guinness
side
by
side
with
guinness
i
could
tell
the
difference
but
i
didnt
really
prefer
one
over
the
other
nicely
done
one
of
victorys
very
few
low
performers
flavor
of
toasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
and
some
very
faint
coffee
very
smooth
d
a
wonderful
beer
from
victory
fantastic
that
it
is
only
3
7
abv
this
makes
donnybrook
a
wonderful
session
beer
the
anti
storm
king
in
abv
but
not
in
flavor
well
done
in
making
an
irish
dry
stout
with
flavor
and
not
just
another
lame
attempt
at
duplicating
guinness
which
isnt
that
great
to
begin
with
after
trying
uncle
teddys
bitter
for
the
first
time
at
fatheads
we
wandered
up
e
carson
a
couple
blocks
where
we
found
donnybrook
stout
flowing
at
smokin
joes
appears
a
deep
dark
roasted
coffee
hue
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
light
cream
cascading
tan
head
leaves
behind
even
rings
of
lacing
with
each
sip
aromatics
full
dark
roasted
malts
bring
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
roast
bitterness
with
herbal
hop
backings
and
some
creamy
milk
chocolate
after
tones
to
balance
out
the
dryness
flavors
are
cohesive
and
resilient
despite
the
fact
that
i
usually
find
nitro
tap
offerings
to
be
way
to
clean
and
airy
tasting
dark
roasted
malts
give
me
chocolate
strong
coffee
and
creamy
sensations
like
some
irish
coffee
in
many
aspects
mild
hop
bitterness
with
herbal
tea
leaf
hop
sensations
are
really
welcomed
to
give
the
dry
bitterness
a
little
snap
mouthfeel
is
creamy
like
a
milkshake
get
ready
to
clear
your
beer
mustache
with
this
one
somewhat
airy
but
the
creaminess
is
there
and
theres
enough
body
to
not
come
off
thin
i
would
say
medium
bodied
range
like
i
said
nitro
taps
usually
kill
the
beer
for
me
but
that
wasnt
the
case
one
of
the
best
representations
of
the
style
ive
come
across
in
quite
awhile
drinkability
find
this
on
st
paddys
or
any
other
festive
drinking
day
and
this
would
be
by
the
pint
however
that
night
at
smokin
joes
there
were
just
too
many
other
interesting
offerings
to
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
but
next
time
i
see
it
i
will
drink
up
hopefully
in
number
interesting
it
tastes
like
storm
kinglight
its
very
drinkable
but
not
your
average
irish
dry
stout
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
sweet
chocolate
liquor
without
any
alcohol
its
just
a
little
sweet
and
smooth
flavorful
for
the
abv
but
like
a
i
said
but
expect
a
normal
dry
stout
i
had
a
pint
on
tap
at
d
b
a
in
manhattan
it
was
pitch
black
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
and
smelled
surprisingly
rich
to
me
for
the
style
there
was
some
chocolate
and
coffee
which
i
dont
normally
get
out
of
dry
stouts
the
flavor
was
nice
roasted
malts
and
coffee
not
really
any
bitterness
except
maybe
a
hint
in
the
aftertaste
it
went
down
easily
and
at
the
low
alcohol
level
you
can
drink
it
for
a
long
time
recommended
this
brew
came
in
a
standard
nonic
glass
poured
to
a
deep
black
color
with
a
frothy
guinness
like
head
that
broke
down
slowly
and
did
leave
a
nice
sheen
on
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
nice
looking
brew
to
say
the
least
the
aromas
seemed
to
be
more
on
the
burnt
side
than
toasted
some
coffee
like
scents
and
a
slight
hop
the
taste
seemed
to
resemble
the
aromas
quite
closely
the
malt
seemed
to
have
a
slight
astringent
flavoring
but
to
me
this
brew
tasted
like
it
was
missing
something
not
overly
robust
slight
hop
finish
was
good
but
just
think
that
i
have
had
better
dry
stouts
the
feel
was
very
creamy
and
again
to
its
style
had
a
dry
finish
all
in
all
i
was
let
down
by
this
brew
but
again
i
am
viewing
a
single
persons
view
let
me
just
finish
by
saying
that
my
expectations
where
high
and
was
a
little
let
down
and
this
is
probably
why
i
have
been
as
harsh
it
is
a
fair
brew
overall
a
nice
dry
stout
good
drinkability
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
layer
of
creamy
and
rich
darkish
tan
head
on
top
smells
strongly
of
roasted
malts
with
some
subtler
notes
of
sugars
and
dark
fruitiness
taste
was
a
little
paler
and
subdued
than
i
expected
given
the
appearance
and
smell
had
a
slightly
metallic
and
watery
aftertaste
that
sort
of
ruined
the
initial
taste
which
was
a
great
mix
of
malts
and
sugars
with
some
underlying
bitter
bite
felt
good
in
my
mouth
round
and
filling
but
not
too
heavy
quite
creamy
if
the
taste
was
vamped
up
a
bit
to
maintain
the
initial
level
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
but
as
it
was
i
moved
on
to
something
else
d
another
great
beer
from
victory
that
you
can
only
get
at
the
brewery
the
low
abv
3
7
makes
it
a
great
session
beer
and
is
a
welcomed
break
from
other
places
that
are
trying
to
recreate
guinness
draught
victory
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
dense
tan
head
there
was
some
cascading
of
the
head
very
guinnesslike
it
leaves
some
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
mild
there
were
some
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
and
abv
would
imply
lighter
body
but
a
good
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
very
easy
to
drink
extremely
drinkable
if
you
want
a
session
stout
this
is
it
with
the
low
abv
its
a
light
tasty
stout
that
begs
to
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
this
is
my
favorite
stout
local
philly
brewers
are
making
stouts
a
standard
and
i
couldnt
be
happier
i
got
this
fresh
pint
from
the
blue
dog
cafe
in
lansdale
great
roasty
flavor
not
sour
or
acidic
full
bodied
and
jet
black
similar
to
oharas
nonnitro
stout
favorite
but
with
more
body
and
a
fuller
consistancy
eastern
pa
residents
try
this
stout
i
promise
you
will
love
it
easy
drinking
as
its
under
4
abv
d
under
4
are
you
kidding
me
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
you
can
belly
up
to
all
day
long
great
beer
to
drink
lots
of
my
girl
thought
i
wouldnt
like
it
because
it
was
so
light
i
was
in
heavenvery
creamyseductivelight
and
down
right
tasty
diatribe
in
this
day
and
age
of
big
beers
it
is
refreshing
both
literally
and
figuratively
to
have
such
a
wonderfully
memorable
brew
like
this
cheers
very
drinkable
was
excellent
to
session
on
a
long
day
of
chili
eating
i
will
start
with
amazing
first
bar
harbor
brewing
offering
ive
ever
had
one
of
the
best
and
most
unique
stouts
i
have
ever
had
pours
almost
completely
black
with
some
red
highlights
creamy
tan
head
with
light
lacing
that
fades
quickly
upfront
tastes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
fades
to
plum
raisin
and
toffee
with
roasted
malts
and
smokey
notes
just
a
bit
of
hops
with
a
dry
easy
finish
very
complex
yet
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
new
addition
to
my
top
ten
beers
i
highly
recommend
that
you
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
picked
up
a
six
pack
at
giant
eagle
market
district
in
pittsburgh
overall
this
is
easily
the
best
irish
dry
stout
iv
had
and
its
an
american
beer
i
think
thats
quite
an
achievement
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
one
is
an
exception
its
very
complex
as
i
get
chocolate
and
coffee
and
undertones
of
dark
fruit
smoke
tobacco
liquorice
etc
definitely
a
world
beater
in
the
irish
dry
stout
category
and
its
not
hard
to
find
at
all
in
western
pa
as
i
see
it
at
giant
eagle
and
my
local
beer
distributor
regularly
cheers
straight
up
irish
dry
stout
good
flavor
with
a
roasty
linger
had
on
draft
as
part
of
flight
my
favorite
of
the
group
off
bottle
wildly
overcarbonated
and
this
for
a
style
that
is
supposed
to
be
low
carbonation
prickly
feel
and
thin

a
an
odd
metallic
finish
and
light
fluffy
consistency
but
unremarkable
outside
of
being
a
dry
stout
overalldidint
blow
my
hair
back
but
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
definitely
worth
giving
a
shot
how
bizarre
i
never
heard
of
this
beer
out
of
bar
harbor
i
didnt
think
anything
happened
in
bar
harbor
this
beer
though
was
a
great
find
at
bauer
as
i
planned
on
grabbing
a
coffee
and
this
replaced
that
nonalcoholic
idea
with
something
much
better
took
it
home
immediately
hopefully
someone
else
will
buy
groceries
and
poured
this
amazingly
dark
beer
with
little
head
or
lacing
such
a
great
coffee
smell
with
hints
of
other
things
i
cant
identify
i
think
i
smelled
an
old
tire
but
this
was
so
smooth
and
perfect
not
very
alcoholy
but
a
nice
malt
balance
this
was
great
perhaps
i
will
visit
bar
harbor
for
some
when
they
get
a
road
an
exceptional
stout
slightly
metallic
but
malt
complexity
and
a
porterlike
aftertaste
fantastic
beer
from
bar
harbor
great
tastes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
thick
thick
head
excellent
stout
all
around
this
is
just
one
more
fantastic
beer
on
a
long
list
of
beers
i
wish
i
could
get
down
south
top
notch
stout
made
by
very
nice
people
the
fact
that
they
refuse
to
deal
with
distributorscrooked
aholes
is
understandable
i
miss
the
old

in

it
certainly
stood
up

to
the

this
is
an
excellent

toasted

this
is
firstclass
stout
nice
o
trying
to
learn
bjcp
guidelines
and
this
one
pretty
much
seems
to
hit
home
with
the
irish
dry
stout
catagory
the
only
thing
i
dont
see
described
is
the
bit
of
alcohol
aroma
and
taste
bar
harbor
brewing
beers
were
my
entry
into
craft
beer
and
i
forgot
how
good
they
are
although
i
wonder
if
the
quality
has
gone
down
a
touch
since
the
brewery
was
sold
from
the
original
owners
years
ago
ive
been
looking
for
this
one
for
a
while
a
personal
white
whale
for
me
its
not
really
rare
at
all
so
i
guess
i
could
say
its
more
like
my
white
porpoise
or
something
o
i
have
been
looking
or
this
beer
since
the
yellow
narrow
ratebeer
ticker
book
came
out
years
ago
and
this
beer
certainly
exceeded
my
expectations
i
can
see
how
it
might
be
considered
an
imperial
dry
stout
it
packs
a
ton
of
aroma
and
flavor
into
a
6
7
beer
unique
in
execution
and
worth
looking
for
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
dry
stout
the
chocolate
is
the
key
to
this
one
the
roasted
nut
finish
is
a
nice
follow
similar
flavors
of
char
and
chocolate
in
the
malt
but
has
some
assertive
hops
to
balance
thick
mouthfeel
but
not
cloying
leaves
the
palate
when
asked
to
move
on
one
is
enough
but
a
nice
beer
overall
overall
this
beer
has
earned
its
reputation
as
a
soughtafter
craft
stout
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
it
if
you
havent
bold
flavors
good
density
terrific
aromas
great
stuff
o
pretty
darn
good
american
sensibilities
for
sure
id
love
to
have
this
on
tap
either
around
town
here
or
at
the
brewery
probably
wont
seek
out
another
bottle
though
overall
this
really
is
an
outstanding
beer
my
experience
puts
this
near
the
top
of
perfectly
balanced
darks
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
stouts
that
ive
had
o
a
good
stout
but
the
lingering
bitterness
at
first
detracts
from
the
experience
and
it
seems
a
bit
light
on
mouthfeel
for
a
superior
stout
on
the
plus
side
the
relatively
low
abv
allows
a
full
glass
will
not
put
you
under
and
its
pretty
easy
drinking
especially
later
its
also
possible
the
aging
on
this
particular
bottle
it
was
purchased
in
early
july
2013
did
not
benefit
the
flavor
the
taste
has
a
pleasant
chocolate
malt
character
with
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
end
it
is
a
beer
that
has
won
some
awards
and
it
it
is
easy
to
see
why
aroma
is
a
subtle
roastiness
smells
fresh
alive
vinous
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
tucked
in
there
waaaay
in
the
back
the
taste
is
a
creamy
slightly
sweet
oh
god
it
just
slipped
like
smooth
and
velvety
down
my
throat
but
not
like
velvet
its
like
the
carbonation
is
so
fine
and
light
that
you
get
this
amazing
mouthfeel
oh
but
the
taste
is
a
subtle
creamy
sweet
light
roastiness
with
hardly
any
hop
flavor
and
mostly
light
coffee
the
way
coffee
with
a
little
milk
tastes
or
coffee
milk
if
youre
from
ri
and
in
a
way
like
milk
this
beer
tells
you
you
are
drinking
something
special
something
good
slight
roast
malt
sourness
inthe
aftertaste
but
even
that
makes
you
aware
of
the
complexity
some
bitter
chocolate
overall
really
a
very
nice
dry
stout
this
beer
should
take
the
place
of
guinness
in
every
bar
out
there
there
would
always
be
a
good
choice
on
hand
straight
forward
but
very
good
pretty
darn
bland
if
you
ask
me
will
quench
a
thirst
though
i
bought
quite
a
few
on
a
recent
east
coast
trip
the
recent
reviews
were
decent
enough
and
the
price
is
low
will
update
if
anything
changes
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
not
as
creamy
as
a
guinness
but
very
tasty
and
packs
a
punch
lots
of
head
the
first
pour
was
all
foam
had
to
wait
until
it
died
down
then
poured
out
the
rest
and
it
was
worth
the
wait
great
flavors
of
roasted
barley
and
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
at
under
6
for
a
22
oz
bottle
its
a
great
deal
will
definitely
buy
again
o
this
is
really
good
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
relatively
light
stout
drinks
like
a
four
or
five
percenter
but
packs
in
nearly
seven
quick
buzz
is
duly
noted
o
im
quite
happy
with
how
this
one
aged
i
havent
had
this
one
in
years
but
id
say
i
like
it
more
now
than
i
did
back
in
the
day
even
though
i
enjoyed
it
back
then
too
o
held
up
pretty
good
given
the
age
and
only

super
easy

smoothly

for
the
style
easily
the
best
irish
dry
stout
ive
ever
had
my
wife
brought
me
back
some
from
here
trip
up
to
maine
and
i
lined
one
up
for
the
next
day
curiously
every
bottle
i
opened
exhibited
quite
a
bit
of
foam
leading
me
to
believe
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
batch
so
keeping
that
in
mind
i
took
some
tentative
sips
before
really
drinking
some
down
while
i
do
like
this
beer
i
have
to
say
that
it
left
me
wanting
a
little
more
robustness
im
a
big
fan
of
stouts
and
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
theses
in
other
words
they
didnt
seem
to
fill
my
desire
as
they
seemed
to
lack
a
little
something
that
most
stouts
bring
to
the
table
still
a
worthy
beer
o
very
nice
dry
stout
wellexecuted
in
all
categories
overall
get
this
beer
seriously
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
stout
for
years
now
and
i
finally
found
a
bottle
of
it
blurs
the
lines
of
the
irish
dry
stout
style
certainly
but
i
did
enjoy
it
would
buy
again
loads
of
malt
and
some
molasses
its
delicious
12oz
bottle
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
booze
with
hints
of
chocolate
minimal
lacing
tastes
booze
and
earthy
with
some
hints
of
dark
cherries
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
coffee
grounds
as
well
slightly
floral
aftertaste
light
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
very
drinkable
this
seems
like
a
great
summer
stout
overall
pretty
good
beer
id
grab
every
so
often
only
when
i
made
my
way
through
the
whole
pint
could
i
feel
the
alcohol
yes
its
that
well
hidden
and
didnt
detract
from
the
beer
at
all
while
this
wasnt
terribly
strong
or
rich
this
was
a
solid
brew
that
held
its
own
and
served
as
a
good
example
of
what
an
irish
dry
stout
should
be
its
not
a
session
beer
but
i
cant
imagine
anyone
not
being
able
to
kick
back
with
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
taste
is
dry
and
pleasent
but
drinks
more
like
an
imperial
then
your
standard
stout
kickass
stout
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
until
now
to
finally
give
this
a
whirl
countless
times
ive
passed
up
a
cheap
sixer
of
this
stuff
mainly
because
i
wanted
to
try
it
but
couldnt
justify
buying
a
full
pack
for
the
same
reason
i
can
assure
you
that
wont
happen
again
the
sixpack
will
indeed
come
home
with
me
next
time
a
decent
stout
smooth
and
plenty
drinkable
but
nothing
special
a
great
desert
beer
that
doesnt
weigh
you
down
would
drink
a
ton
if
it
was
on
shelves
near
me
sweet
and
creamy
with
a
dry
finish
hits
all
the
notes
best
dry
stout
ive
had
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
decent
and
basic
perhaps
i
should
have
had
it
sooner
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
full
amber
highlighted
browntoblack
coloring
with
a
thin
layer
of
light
tan
frothy
head
aromas
of
light
coffee
both
roasty
and
bitter
with
a
heavy
dose
of
sweet
creamy
milk
chocolate
flavors
of
more
heavily
roasted
and
bitter
coffee
with
the
sweet
milk
chocolate
serving
more
to
highlight
some
touches
of
roast
and
smoke
throughout
to
help
give
a
dynamic
to
the
palate
the
beer
is
midbodied
but
full
and
robust
aftertastes
of
roast
and
bitter
with
a
warm
overall
feel
the
finish
is
more
of
the
bitter
and
roasty
coffee
but
smooth
enough
to
refrain
from
drying
the
mouth
very
smooth
drinker
and
very
tasty
good
brew
o
perhaps
this
beer
was
past
its
prime
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
batch
but
this
one
really
disappointed
me
im
not
sure
i
will
seek
this
out
again
22
oz
bomber
this
one
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
color
there
was
a
very
small
tan
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
long
almost
no
lacing
nice
nose
pretty
full
or
aroma
but
mainly
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
some
coffee
notes
also
the
taste
is
good
roasty
chocolate
and
coffee
mainly
in
the
taste
a
very
nice
stout
o
this
may
just
be
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
it
is
so
flavorful
and
refreshing
and
not
too
tart
fantastic
overall
very
well
crafted
beer
simple
yet
complex
flavors
give
this
beer
a
terrific
feel
and
taste
i
have
had
it
several
times
and
i
have
always
enjoyed
it
overall
this
beer
was
awesome
if
guinness
tasted
anything
like
this
i
would
be
drowning
myself
in
it
i
wish
that
i
was
able
to
get
this
beer
regularly
just
the
perfect
easy
drinking
stout
i
see
why
this
used
to
grace
the
top
100
back
in
the
day
obar
harbour
im
going
to
keep
my
eye
on
you
this
beer
impressed
me
has
to
be
the
best
irish
dry
ive
ever
had
the
flavors
are
strong
and
awesome
and
its
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
good
non
barrelaged
everyday
stout
beats
the
hell
out
of
a
guinness
but
not
quite
the
level
of
founders
stouts
m
this
is
my
first
dry
stout
and
probably
my
last
the
dryness
takes
that
afore
mentioned
nice
choclate
taste
and
turns
it
sour
i
gave
this
a
3
0
because
i
didnt
think
it
fair
to
pan
it
as
apparently
a
dry
stout
is
supposed
to
do
this
drinkability
the
relatively
high
alcohol
for
a
irish
stout
makes
it
less
drinkable
than
you
would
think
the
carbonation
is
also
a
hindering
factor
thanks
to
greg
for
this
one
cheers
o
normally
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
real
nice
stout
for
the
summer
lighter
in
body
and
lighter
in
alcohol
than
a
lot
of
the
others
available
i
found
this
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
reminds
me
of
time
spent
in
maine
where
the
summer
evenings
still
get
cool
this
beer
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
is
mainly
coffee
with
some
toast
mild
smoke
and
molasses
notes
theres
a
noticeable
hop
bite
but
its
well
balanced
and
the
chocolate
flavor
comes
through
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
bar
harbor
cadillac
mountain
stout
is
a
good
filling
brew
recommended
o
this
is
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
i
have
others
i
like
but
this
one
is
great
in
every
way
for
me
i
think
the
minor
head
and
slight
carbonation
are
a
positive
feature
the
taste
is
so
complex
i
think
too
much
more
carbonation
would
ruin
it
just
open
your
mouth
a
little
to
get
some
air
in
there
and
it
works
better
so
much
character
to
reveal
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
one
not
too
sweet
to
become
cloying
yet
not
too
bitter
and
abrasive
with
roast
or
hops
worth
picking
up
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
it
would
make
for
a
good
selection
if
you
want
a
really
nice
tasting
stout
but
dont
want
something
thats
really
heavy
and
needs
to
be
slowly
sipped
for
this
reason
it
makes
for
a
good
stout
to
have
during
the
summer
totally
black
in
color
with
a
thin
beige
cap
mellow
roasted
malt
and
vanilla
aromas
velvety
smooth
delicate
feel
with
rich
lazy
carbonation
that
builds
thru
the
middle
to
the
end
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
up
front
that
transition
to
a
brief
dark
fruity
sweetness
hop
bitterness
yanks
that
taste
buds
away
from
the
sweetness
thru
the
middle
roasted
malt
flavors
return
down
the
homestretch
with
a
ripe
fruit
flavors
underneath
earthy
delicate
flavors
from
start
to
finish
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
pleasant
delicate
aromas
along
with
a
unique
and
complex
flavor
profile
d
this
may
not
be
the
best
stout
ever
made
but
it
is
definitely
a

a
pleasant
and
powerfully
flavored
stout
but
your
taste
buds
will
have
to
judge
as
to
the
world
class
potential
quite
drinkable
but
very
bitter
and
intense
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at

o
definitely
a
good

and
one
i
would

carbonation
a
great
beeron
the
palate
that
lives
up
to
all
expectations
it
think
this
was
11
99
a
six
pack
in
the
burgh
but
it
was
well
worth
it
im
in
love
with
this
brewery
especially
this
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
with
all
the
powerfl
super
strong
imperial
stouts
out
there
i
am
getting
into
sessionable
american
stouts
more
and
more
this
is
certainly
one
i
would
revisit
and
often
overall
ba
not
something
id
go
crazy
for
but
certainly
a
good
example
of
the
style
im
glad
i
found
a
bottle
during
my
massachusetts
trip
o
gets
more
and
more
impressive
as
it
warms
incredibly
drinkable
and
smooth
highly
recommend
trying
this
if
you
can
overall
if
i
hadnt
been
rating
this
as
it
fits
the
style
i
would
have
given
it
all
3s
maybe
i
just
dont
like
thin
stouts
dry
or
milk
not
sure
but
this
one
certainly
missed
the
target
for
me
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
as
noted
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
this
would
make
sense
as
a
nitro
tap
though
overall
i
was
not
expecting
much
out
of
this
beer
man
was
i
wrong
this
is
a
superb
stout
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
solid
stout
thats
got
a
lot
going
on
inside
o
the
age
on
this
one
played
in
favor
of
the
beer
there
was
a
subtle
dark
fruitiness
that
i
thought
could
have
shown
up
from
the
age
but
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
it
great
roast
and
chocolate
flavors
o
pretty
good
beer
all
around
i
like
the
lingering
smokiness
in
a
stout
really
adds
a
nice
dimension
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
help
to
really
make
it
stand
out
still
a
really
nice
beer
and
glad
i
finally
got
the
chance
to
try
it
decent
but
sorta
smelled
and
tasted
a
bit
stale
maybe
an
older
bottle
but
no
way
of
knowing
its
a
nice
stout
not
ris
maybe
oatmeal
but
it
didnt
nail
the
creamy
nature
of
an
oatmeal
stout
for
me
id
like
to
just
call
it
an
american
stout
something
simple
something
nice
o
nice
stout
a
solid
roasty
backbone
with
balanced
hop
character
fairly
complex
good
mouthfeel
a
likely
repeat
purchase
the
suggestions
of
fig
and
raisins
give
the
beer
more
than
a
onedimensional
flavor
profile
which
is
really
nice
the
chocolate
is
silky
smooth
and
shows
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
hops
definitely
play
a
role
in
the
fairly
dry
and
bitter
finish
kinda
finishes
like
a
sierra
nevada
stout
good
beer
that
manages
to
be
both
approachable
and
flavorful
d
quite
a
delicious
stout
that
i
would
enjoy
again
pretty
easydrinking
which
could
be
dangerous
as
its
approaching
7
but
thats
a
risk
id
be
willing
to
take
cost
4
99
for
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
o
a
solid
stout
nothing
too
interesting
but
very
smooth
and
tasty
overall
i
was
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
hunt
it
down
again
a
good
stout
but
there
are
much
much
better
out
there
d
good
damn
good
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
true
to
the
style
i
love
it
o
overall
a
very
nice
drinkable
stout
3
5
a
nice
classic
stout
in
all
ways
o
very
solid
stout
very
drinkable
would
definitely
have
this
again
think
of
a
nice
irish
dry
stout
and
then
give
it
some
heft
with
loads
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
you
have
this
offering
from
bar
harbor
a
quality
stout
top
to
bottom
o
a
nice
smooth
stout
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
a
fine
american
stout
didnt
look
all
that
impressive
when
poured
but
its
whats
under
the
hood
that
counts
i
need
to
buy
more
of
this
it
has
a
ton
of
chocolaty
and
burnt
flavors
and
its
very
drinkable
its
surprisingly
low
abv
too
its
wellbalanced
and
wellrounded
d
while
all
scores
above
have
been
a
3
5
the
overall
drinkability
is
a
notch
above
while
understated
in
many
respects
the
6
7
abv
that
doesnt
hammer
you
over
the
head
in
a
way
most
american
stouts
seem
to
is
a
pleasant
surprise
not
my
favorite
but
defiantely
worthy
o
regrettably
i
cant
recommend
this
stout
theres
not
enough
complexity
the
booze
seems
to
be
without
a
cause
and
the
aftertaste
is
not
very
pleasant
pours
a
dark
inky
black
with
cap
of
compact
creamy
brown
head
doesnt
last
too
long
though
decent
lacing
scent
is
straight
forward
roasted
grain
with
chocolate
brownie
and
hint
of
vanilla
taste
follows
scent
in
being
very
simple
and
straight
forward
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
execution
dark
roast
stopping
before
any
char
presents
itself
semi
sweet
baking
chocolate
stars
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
the
faintest
notes
of
coffee
and
berry
lower
end
of
full
bodied
smooth
clean
and
lightly
creamy
well
executed
stout
greatly
appreciated
in
a
time
where
every
beer
in
this
style
seems
to
be
wanting
to
go
big
o
a
very
well
done
stout
really
easy
to
drink
and
the
palate
grabs
hold
of
all
the
flavor
after
a
minute
break
bw
sips
would
like
to
try
a
imperial
stout
from
bar
harbor
dr
very
good
but
took
a
while
to
finish
a
bomber
sippy
beer
pours
an
inkjet
black
that
is
entirely
opaque
very
little
lighttan
head
develops
and
what
does
appear
fades
quickly
some
legs
are
left
in
the
glass
and
a
hearty
swirl
breathes
new
life
into
a
bubbly
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
a
few
patches
of
bubbles
cling
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
it
smells
of
coffee
caramel
roasted
malt
some
oatgrain
and
a
touch
of
sugar
very
stoutlike
taste
is
very
similar
with
plenty
of
roasted
malt
some
chocolate
grain
sugar
coffee
and
caramel
all
making
appearances
the
mouth
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
leaving
a
dry
and
slightly
sticky
finish
overall
a
good
stout
that
is
worth
trying
4
0
d
good
brew
they
should
brew
this
beer
like
they
brewed
the
one
im
drinking
o
overall
more
porter
like
than
anything
else
but
the
body
is
way
less
fizzy
want
an
idyllic
maine
beer
this
is
the
one
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
dry
and
chewy
drinks
nicely
pretty
solid
flavor
although
not
too
complex
o
much
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
totally
enjoyable
would
definitely
be
a
regular
bottle
for
me
if
it
were
around
not
a
lifechanger
but
a
damn
solid
brew
do
drinkability
is
moderate
the
base
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
all
solid
and
promising
but
there
are
some
things
that
keep
it
from
reaching
excellence
the
metallic
notes
are
one
thing
as
well
as
the
rather
weak
flavors
in
the
taste
o
ive
had
several
stouts
in
my
time
by
now
and
id
rate
this
one
as
middle
of
the
pack
it
has
all
the
bells
and
whistles
of
a
stout
but
not
enough
strength
maybe
with
a
good
steak
this
beer
might
have
presented
better
so
be
it
very
very
good
stuff
here
a
great
looking
full
bodied
easy
drinking
stout
delicious
overall
my
favorite
dry
stout
to
date
and
very
drinkable
i
spent
my
labor
day
drinking
many
beers
and
several
of
these
were
in
the
line
up
thanks
to
my
wifes
uncle
charlie
overall
this
is
a
nice
stout
but
nothin
to
get
too
excited
orr
in
the
trading
world
id
drink
this
if
it
were
on
shelves
or
on
tap
locally
for
a
cheap
price
22
oz
standard
bomber
with
no
freshness
date
pours
straight
black
with
an
indeterminate
carbonation
level
and
a
halfinch
of
medium
tan
head
that
reduces
to
a
wellretained
collar
which
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
smells
roasty
with
mild
coffee
cocoa
powder
earthy
yeast
and
just
a
hint
of
papery
oxidation
the
flavor
is
fairly
mild
and
adds
augments
the
bouquet
with
notes
of
greenoily
hops
and
a
creeping
bitterness
on
top
of
a
light
tingly
dry
and
chalky
body
tastes
a
lot
more
irish
than
american
to
me
as
it
is
light
and
smooth
so
much
so
that
i
dont
quite
believe
the
stated
abv
easily
drinkable
and
certainly
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
it
down
had
a
few
mothers
milks
this
week
from
keegan
ales
and
thought
they
were
solid
b
stouts
this
one
is
one
notch
below
certainly
nothing
profound
here
not
bad
but
not
great
either
od
it
has
great
roasted
characteristic
and
a
surprising
hop
acidity
to
it
worth
checking
out
oa
decent
stout
however
the
mouthfeel
totally
threw
me
off
the
lack
of
carbonation
was
a
major
turn
off
to
an
otherwise
decent
beer
huh
this
was
unexpected
ive
had
this
beer
once
years
ago
and
i
certainly
remember
liking
it
more
than
this
the
roasted
and
smoky
characteristics
seemed
a
bit
overwrought
for
a
supposedly
straightforward
american
stout
overall
the
age
on
this
bottle
may
have
muted
the
flavors
somewhat
but
then
again
given
how
well
some
other
american
stouts
have
held
up
this
one
may
have
just
been
mild
to
begin
with
regardless
while
this
is
not
a
lifechanging
memorable
stout
beer
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
that
was
enjoyable
to
drink
which
is
reason
enough
to
recommend
it
in
my
book
thanks
again
for
including
this
one
in
our
trade
masterski
d
a
solid
brew
for
sure
i
was
just
up
in
acadia
and
i
figured
id
try
this
one
with
stout
season
coming
up
and
i
now
know
that
it
will
be
a
goto
all
fall
and
winter
long
very
good
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
this
is
the
third
beer
from
maine
ive
been
able
to
enjoy
after
allagashs
curieux
and
belfast
bays
lobster
ale
this
had
a
monster
3
head
after
a
rather
vigorous
pour
opaque
typical
of
a
stout
nice
malted
chocolate
aroma
with
some
hints
of
coffee
and
licorice
although
muted
taste
follows
the
nose
with
more
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
toffee
this
a
bit
on
the
thinner
side
it
doesnt
coat
your
mouth
heavily
the
beer
departs
with
a
slight
tinge
of
acidityalkaline
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
a
very
easy
drinker
that
should
appeal
to
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
id
definitely
go
back
to
this
awesome
stout
this
tastes
a
little
like
a
milksweet
stout
but
with
some
added
dryness
towards
the
end
vanilla
notes
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
dark
fruit
upfront
molassas
burnt
roastedness
towards
the
middle
a
nice
intriguing
dry
bitterness
at
the
end
a
sweeter
stout
but
still
very
complex
chewy
smooth
mouthfeel
so
drinkable
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
i
have
ever
had
ratings
dont
lie
on
this
one
fantastic
stout
glad
to
have
tried
it
recommended
overall
impression
a
solid
stout
thats
well
worth
a
try
m
smooth
and
semi
thick
character
great
overall
its
good
nothing
is
overly
good
but
its
well
integrated
a
solid
black
concoction
with
just
a
bit
of
a
tan
ring
on
top
and
fair
lacing
the
nose
detects
mellow
roasted
coffee
beans
and
fruity
rhubarb
with
the
prefunctory
note
of
chocolate
malt
very
tasteful
and
speaking
of
taste
the
flavor
offers
intense
coffee
bitterness
and
near
grape
juicewinelike
sweetness
but
its
definitely
about
the
coffee
and
there
remains
some
chocolate
idea
in
there
with
a
fairly
dry
but
aqueous
feel
and
a
little
touch
of
creaminess
carbonation
is
adequate
with
tiny
bubbles
in
a
mediumfull
bodied
brew
that
really
sticks
to
your
ribs
while
remaining
thoroughly
drinkable
this
a
special
stout
that
should
easily
appeal
to
all
stout
lovers
o
awesome
brew
thanks
for
the
extra
andy
i
owe
you
a
few
o
i
dont
know
how
some
breweries
find
this
kind
of
balance
this
is
one
of
those
rare
brews
that
defines
the
style
ive
tried
tons
of
the
great
american
stouts
on
the
market
obsidian
kalamazoo
central
waters
coffeehouse
etc
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
them
maybe
even
above
them
o
wow
great
tasting
stout
overall
simple
flavors
all
blend
well
to
create
a
beer
that
id
seek
out
again
overall
very
good
dry
stout
quite
bold
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thick
but
i
would
have
that
beer
again
o
i
can
not
wait
to
but
this
beer
again
and
drink
it
maybe
it
was
my
good
mood
as
well
that
made
me
like
the
beer
so
much
either
way
well
worth
the
try
and
the
addition
to
the
burger
full
body
with
somewhat
coarse
carbonation
overall
this
ones
pretty
good
a
well
done
accesable
stout
overall
this
is
a
great
stout
im
usually
swimming
in
imperials
so
its
nice
to
take
a
step
back
and
appreciate
a
well
made
regular
stout
o
decent
stout
well
balanced
and
smooth
as
can
be
i
think
the
would
have
even
been
better
on
tap
the
taste
starts
with
a
mix
of
roasted
malts
the
carbonation
fills
the
mouth
and
reveals
a
creamy
roasted
taste
the
carbonation
subsides
and
leaves
the
mouth
dry
overall
my
first
take
on
this
beer
was
that
it
was
mindblowing
i
decided
to
drink
a
second
bottle
to
make
sure
the
second
bottle
showed
me
that
its
not
a
knockyoursocksoff
kind
of
beer
but
its
extremely
well
balanced
and
delicious
to
boot
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
east
coast
ipa
and
at
78
for
the
500ml
its
a
solid
find
tastes
are
sorghum
some
roast
coffee
rice
peach
skins
hops
pecans
walnuts
watermelon
seeds
alfalfa
light
malt
dark
malt
garlic
milk
chocolate
nutmeg
and
a
neutral
slinky
flavor
smells
like
a
stout
that
is
a
good
stout
with
light
chocolate
textures
and
some
nuttiness
me
likey
likey
likey
oa
very
drinkable
stout
ive
tasted
others
with
more
complexity
but
this
is
decent
enough
as
far
as
im
aware
its
only
available
in
bombers
and
at
the
equivalent
of
13
64
per
six
pack
i
can
find
better
examples
at
a
lower
price
cadillac
mountain
exhibits
choice
simplicity
wellcrafted
and
flavorful
example
of
an
american
stout
an
easy
recommendation
o
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
impressed
with
the
nose
and
taste
on
this
one
as
it
provides
great
bold
notes
for
a
stout
under
7
abv
overall
another
beer
that
is
not
hyped
at
all
but
knocked
my
socks
off
if
you
see
it
it
is
worth
getting
pours
very
black
when
held
to
light
garnet
around
the
edges
alot
of
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
nose
very
roasty
flavor
nice
chocolate
notes
slight
pleasant
bitterness
from
the
black
patent
this
is
avery
drinkable
beer
and
obviosly
well
crafted
this
is
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
nice
brownish
red
lot
of
nice
tan
head
smells
really
nice
and
roasty
tons
of
coffee
and
smokiness
on
the
nose
taste
just
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
roasty
character
sweet
and
not
dry
at
all
on
the
tongue
nice
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
darn
solid
o
overall
this
is
clearly
well
made
tasty
clean
and
delicious
very
enjoyable
o
nice
smell
and
initial
taste
but
a
little
hard
to
finished
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
an
above
average
stout
one
that
i
would
drink
again
but
not
earth
shattering
the
carb
could
use
some
work
thanks
again
mike
for
sending
me
this
one
o
great
overall
it
is
an
easy
drinker
but
there
just
isnt
much
complexity
to
it
i
can
take
it
or
leave
it
mediumlight
body
moderately
high
carbonation
seltzer
like
feel
very
easy
to
drink
maybe
too
easy
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
im
still
new
to
stouts
just
kind
of
dipping
my
toes
in
them
but
this
is
damn
good
and
very
drinkable
glad
i
got
to
give
this
one
a
go
i
feel
like
this
is
very
very
good
i
want
a
6
pack
and
ive
never
really
wanted
a
6
pack
of
stouts
before
overall
a
pleasant
stout
with
a
nice
blending
of
flavors
id
drink
it
again
if
it
was
available
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
a
great
standard
stout
nothing
mind
blowing
just
solid
o
pretty
good
stout
if
this
was
local
to
me
id
be
trying
it
on
tap
if
possible
45
glad
to
finally
have
the
chance
to
try
this
one
pours
dark
brown
near
black
thin
tan
head
nose
has
chocolate
dark
malts
and
hops
taste
is
well
balanced
light
to
medium
body
well
carbonated
a
nice
beer
but
notthing
spectacular
good
brew
to
was
down
a
burger
overall
drinkability
i
will
admit
this
beer
has
impressed
me
i
was
going
into
this
one
expected
just
an
average
beer
but
this
is
actually
a
damn
tasty
stout
its
a
shame
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
next
time
ill
have
to
get
more
and
theyll
be
bombers
too
recommend
thin
on
the
palate
as
the
pour
suggested
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
as
it
does
unfortunately
thin
out
the
texture
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
solid
stout
that
doesnt
try
to
be
too
much
of
anything
that
it
isnt
i
dont
know
where
they
give
out
platinum
medals
but
i
can
certainly
see
how
this
beer
could
win
some
awards
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
this
stout
this
aged
bottle
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
once
legendary
status
of
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
most
likely
fresh
and
certainly
nothing
older
than
a
year
old
i
had
samples
fresh
at
the
brewery
and
i
remember
liking
it
more
but
the
time
and
place
could
have
been
a
factor
in
that
memory
people
will
tell
you
that
the
beer
isnt
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
before
the
brewery
changed
hands
and
supposedly
the
recipe
changed
i
cant
really
comment
on
that
as
i
wasnt
much
of
a
beer
geek
back
when
i
had
the
original
recipe
and
i
dont
remember
how
it
tasted
still
it
is
a
very
good
stout
that
is
worth
seeking
out
i
give
a
schlitz
about
cadillac
mountain
stout
smooth
sessionable
drinker
but
really
lacking
any
outstanding
punch
perhaps
balance
is
its
strongest
suit
but
definitely
not
as
striking
as
i
remember
pours
with
almost
no
head
half
a
finger
at
best
black
coffee
colored
body
clear
some
deep
red
if
held
up
to
the
light
kind
of
a
let
down
that
the
head
dissipates
immediately
a
ring
of
lacing
does
remain
smells
quite
nice
coffee
espresso
sweet
malts
roasted

milk
chocolate
tastes
is
off
roasted
barley
lots
of
it
some
dry
coco
some
burnt
sugar
sweet
malts
toffee
maybe
as
well
the
finish
is
dry
with
some
lingering
oily
bitterness
the
taste
on
this
not
too
bad
but
the
lack
of
body
confuses
me
i
kind
of
think
of
it
as
an
ipa
without
the
hoppy
flavors
andor
aroma
again
the
body
is
mediumthin
medium
high
carbonation
the
dry
finish
and
kind
of
thin
body
leaves
this
one

d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
american
stout
it
features
all
the
flavors
youd
expect
in
a
stout
and
has
a
great
balance
d
i
must
admit
i
had
this
beer
at
an
imperial
stout
tasting
and
this
poor
beer
followed
behind
several
much
larger
and
bolder
stouts
my
review
probably
isnt
doing
this
beer
justice
as
it
just
could
not
hold
its
own
against
its
larger
brethren
however
i
did
feel
this
was
still
a
good
stout
and
certainly
was
the
easy
drinker
of
the
bunch
drinkabilitythis
is
a
very
solid
stout
not
extraordinary
but
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
drinkability
is
inconsistent
but
at
the
end
made
me
feel
like
i
could
continue
however
i
would
not
suggest
thinking
doing
more
than
3
of
these
md
medium
bodied
nice
carbonation
has
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
would
love
for
this
to
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
too
bad
getting
the
22oz
bottles
down
in
delaware
was
a
random
happening
bottle
black
pour
thin
brownish
head
quickly
recedes
into
a
ring
with
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
chocolaty
some
burnt
toast
kind
of
light
aroma
or
heavy
if
comparing
with
guinness
draught
taste
is
the
high
point
of
this
beer
taste
of
fresh
bread
some
toastiness
with
a
very
well
balanced
sweetness
chocolatymolasses
a
hint
of
dry
herbs
anise
to
finish
it
off
dry
palate
is
very
sessionnable
well
dosed
carbonation
mediumlight
bodied
damn
id
love
to
have
this
on
tap
at
my
local
bar
drinkability
all
the
aromas
and
tastes
described
above
are
very
inviting
and
the
aftertaste
sits
very
lightly
in
the
mouth
despite
being
such
a
heavy
bold
beer
the
cpj
d
a
very
solid
beer
i
have
heard
that
the
small
batch
bomber
variation
is
much
better
than
the
6pack
variation
and
if
one
if
to
consume
they
must
do
so
with
a
bomber
my
local
bottle
shop
has
both
and
the
bomber
mentions
right
on
the
label
that
this
is
a
small
batch
beer
every
sip
makes
this
beer
better
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
think
the
complexity
is
outstanding
d
delicious
and
refreshing
stout
d
stuff
is
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
american
stout
there
is
a
reason
why
this
is
one
of
the
top
beers
for
this
style
its
just
that
good
this
was
my
first
beer
from
bar
harbor
and
im
impressed
i
will
certainly
try
their
other
work
d
decent
not
great
a
bit
too
thin
and
fizzy
for
a
stout
but
better
then
average
give
it
a
try
if
you
have
a
chance
more
of
that
in
the
taste
thought
this
was
a
great
example
of
a
chewy
stout
that
isnt
uber
high
in
alcohol
reminiscient
of
obsidian
stout
in
that
they
both
have
substantial
malt
chewiness
relatively
cheap
and
not
over
the
top
alcohol
would
definitely
check
this
out
if
i
could
get
it
out
here
thanks
to
jsilva
for
throwing
this
down
drinkability
highly
drinkable
good
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
definitely
the
best
beer
that
atlanticbar
harbor
brewing
makes
when
your
looking
for
a
really
good
stout
this
a
solid
bet
pours
an
opaque
black
with
ruby
color
seen
only
if
held
to
intense
light
has
a
brown
1
5finger
head
which
dwindles
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
on
the
head
smells
divine
toffee
sweetness
balanced
by
coffee
bitterness
and
acidity
somewhat
smokey
smell
as
well
tastes
of
toffee
dark
chocolate
with
a
really
coffee
like
finish
which
lingers
throughout
the
tongue
absolutely
an
outstanding
stoutnothing
like
it
i
loved
this
meal
in
a
bottle
from
the
first
sip
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
it
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
ever
d
solid
american
stout
here
as
previously
mentioned
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
but
one
of
the
better
put
together
american
stouts
i
have
tried
big
thanks
to
drezz77
for
sending
this
beer
my
way
d
not
particularly
inspiring
given
the
options
generally
i
enjoy
a
heartier
body
when
it
comes
to
stouts
but
if
you
are
trying
to
introduce
friends
to
better
stouts
this
is
a
high
quality
wellcrafted
ale
quite
enjoyable
d
not
bad
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
just
not
my
taste
when
it
comes
to
stouts
particularly
in
the
mouthfeel
poured
midnight
black
in
my
cigar
city
snifter
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
that
lasted
just
under
a
minute
thin
trail
of
bubbles
is
all
thats
left
of
it
clear
with
amber
brown
hues
in
the
light
immediate
waft
of
burnt
toast
and
caramel
touch
of
pale
grain
and
this
might
sound
really
odd
but
i
get
a
bit
of
french
fries
and
coffee
word
very
roasty
and
robust
i
can
definitely
taste
the
black
patent
coming
through
followed
closely
by
a
deep
grainynuttiness
and
dark
roast
coffee
the
flavor
is
brisk
lasting
as
long
as
the
beer
sits
on
the
palate
but
finishes
with
a
lightly
ashy
and
graininess
that
lingers
complementing
a
dry
finish
nearly
astringent
carbonation
is
kept
moderate
neither
prickling
the
tongue
nor
slicking
the
palate
beautifully
made
thanks
again
dude
good
job
maine
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
full
bodied
but
goes
down
well
the
nice
bold
flavors
keep
your
mind
on
the
great
flavors
and
hide
the
abv
a
really
great
american
stout
drinkability
relatively
so
a
pretty
good
stout
d
while
low
for
your
average
6
7
beer
its
pretty
good
for
a
stout
and
a
very
enjoyable
drink
too
this
one
did
not
last
long
in
the
glass
d
the
drinkability
is
not
to
impressive
definitely
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
in
the
future
d
great
pissed
that
i
have
to
take
a
trip
to
maine
to
get
this
this
is
a
really
good
stout
much
better
than
i
expected
notes
must
try
fuller
bodied
run
the
12oz
with
a
silkier
chocolate
malt
presnce
slightly
more
smokey
with
more
of
a
bitter
coffee
bean
flavor
it
also
has
a
subtle
lactic
creaminess
that
the
12oz
lactic
making
it
more
complex
and
quaffable
hits
of
licorice
and
hazelnut
before
a
bitter
dry
finish
better
balanced
than
he
smaller
bottle
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
nicely
blended
and
balanced
brew
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
d
not
overly
drinkable
for
a
6
7
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
dont
mind
drinking
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
goes
down
pretty
smooth
i
had
it
while
relaxing
after
a
nice
piece
of
steak
good
beer
for
this
style
and
would
have
again
and
has
no
feel
of
heavy
alcohol
easily
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
a
fantastic
stout
great
balance
and
unbelievable
depth
for
just
a
6
7
stout
hightly
recommend
nice
smokey
aroma
and
flavor
but
overall
rather
watery
i
prefer
stouts
that
command
attention
whereas
this
one
seems
to
prefer
sitting
in
the
corner
waving
a
little
lace
handkerchief
notice
me
no
wait
dont
notice
me
the
smoke
is
heavyhanded
although
i
liked
it
and
covers
any
other
characteristic
that
might
be
hiding
in
the
beer
theres
a
salty
taste
here
that
would
be
nice
if
it
were
offset
by
something
slightly
bitter
if
you
like
allham
beer
this
is
for
you
if
you
prefer
balance
look
elsewhere
the
taste
is
oily
on
the
tongue
fairly
medium
bodied
despite
what
the
marketers
claim
on
the
label
the
beer
has
too
many
charred
flavors
for
my
linking
not
enough
body
some
biting
notes
and
is
just
okay
i
will
rereview
just
to
make
sure
that
i
am
not
panning
a
beer
without
due
diligience
but
this
beer
just
isnt
great
more
to
come
not
bad
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
could
drink
several
as
long
as
you
are
buying
notes
tastes
an
awful
lot
like
a
milk
stout
to
me
its
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
didnt
bowl
me
over
i
have
only
ever
had
this
in
the
12oz
format
i
would
like
to
try
one
of
the
bottle
conditioned
bombers
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
d
at
6
7
its
definitely
good
but
how
far
can
stouts
really
go
in
terms
of
how
many
you
can
drink
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
and
malty
no
hops
are
detectable
in
the
brew
at
the
time
i
am
consuming
it
the
coffee
flavorsdark
roasted
malts
add
a
nice
dryness
to
the
finish
of
this
beer
this
is
freakin
amazing
what
a
nice
treat
there
is
nothing
i
enjoy
more
than
a
nice
balanced
average
abv
stout
and
this
totally
fits
the
bill
the
flavors
are
extremely
wellbalanced
the
mouthfeel
is
kinda
light
but
still
above
average
i
have
nothing
else
to
say
about
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
until
i
passed
out
because
it
is
soooo
darn
good
so
so
so
sooth
and
silky
seek
it
out
and
hoard
for
future
consumption
good
beer
and
nice
solid
stout
i
would
not
mind
getting
another
one
of
these
this
should
be
in
as
a
dry
irish
stout
and
an
a
at
that
its
hitting
all
the
marks
for
dry
stout
which
cant
be
an
accident
even
still
hops
character
could
be
brought
up
a
little
within
the
style
easydrinking
but
roast
a
bit
too
prominent
and
too
quiet
for
its
own
good
d
decent
flavor
but
a
bit
dull
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
gobble
gobble
everybody
after
a
disappointing
first
go
at
it
last
month
i
tried
it
again
and
was
richly
rewarded
worthy
of
true
beerfaring
adventures
poured
a
22oz
bomber
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
completely
opaque
dark
brownblack
with
a
2
finger
bubbly
mocha
brown
head
the
head
clung
to
the
sides
nicely
and
settled
down
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
was
slightly
malty
but
nicely
sweet
small
amounts
of
dark
brown
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
lactose
taste
was
a
mellow
sweet
slight
bitter
kick
on
the
toungue
that
switched
to
a
dark
chocolate
coffee
flavor
felt
good
in
the
mouth
nicely
carbonated
a
hint
on
the
thin
side
compared
to
many
stouts
but
not
bad
very
drinkable
more
like
a
drink
and
less
like
a
beer
while
good
this
isnt
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
id
grab
for
something
else
local
like
buried
hatchet
rather
than
this
d
overall
a
decent
stout
pretty
much
what
a
stout
should
be
i
drank
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
really
think
this
beer
is
better
than
the
overall
score
it
received
from
be
mainly
because
of
its
appearance
also
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
than
a
4
but
not
a
4
5
solid
stout
overall
d
good
drinkability
for
a
big
stout
nice
flavor
awesome
mouthfeel
of
course
we
ticked
to
be
sure
weve
secured
it
should
it
pops
back
on
the
top
100
p
thanks
again
for
sending
this
my
way
keith
eric
we
gotta
get
another
trade
going
one
of
these
days
cheers
this
beer
made
me
stop
and
notice
how
the
complexity
and
finish
was
a
step
above
most
others
of
this
style
lovely
smoky
roasted
malt
falvour
coupled
with
a
tight
chocolatey
finish
that
seemed
to
go
on
for
way
longer
than
expected
class
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
rep
check
all
the
beer
books
from
the
early
2000s
and
this
is
well
regarded
great
beer
but
sadly
it
was
brought
back
from
maine
in
a
suitcase
d
its
not
too
bitter
like
some
stouts
can
be
which
is
good
tasty
stout
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
glad
i
tried
this
one
though
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
quality
stout
no
nonsense
just
a
well
done
straight
up
american
stout
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
to
it
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
if
you
see
it
but
may
not
be
for
those
that
prefer
a
sweeter
stout
while
the
flavor
is
a
lot
better
than
the
nose
led
me
to
be
i
find
that
i
am
quite
disappointed
i
was
really
expecting
a
lot
from
this
beer
and
it
just
sort
of
fizzles
out
it
is
nice
and
easy
drinking
but
isnt
nearly
as
flavorful
as
i
was
hoping
i
will
happily
stick
to
my
goto
kalamazoo
stout
from
bells
overall
a
great
stout
overall
im
really
liking
this
stout
a
lot
it
seems
like
the
riss
double
stouts
and
barrel
aged
stouts
get
all
the
attention
these
days
but
its
nice
to
have
a
plain
old
american
stout
for
a
change
simple
straightforward
and
delicious
notes
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
brew
and
it
just
did
not
measure
up
i
liked
it
but
it
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
just
too
sweet
it
is
a
good
dessert
beer
and
i
hope
to
one
day
drink
it
again
but
it
wont
be
something
that
i
strive
to
get
often
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
big
rocky
mocha
head
that
eventually
resides
roasted
chocolate
on
the
nose
nom
nom
nom
sweet
cocoa
flavor
starts
things
out
and
transitions
to
a
light
bitterness
partly
roasted
and
partly
from
some
subtle
hops
less
carbonation
than
expected
from
the
looks
of
the
head
and
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
tad
thin
which
really
only
serves
to
make
this
even
more
easy
drinking
drinkability
is
really
very
good
it
smells
good
is
quite
tasty
and
isnt
too
much
of
a
chore
to
drink
with
a
light
feel
and
a
very
well
hidden
abv
i
polished
off
my
glass
quite
quickly
and
could
have
easily
had
another
a
quality
stout
from
bar
harbor
brewing
d
this
stout
was
definitely
a
solid
beer
i
picked
this
up
while
visiting
in
bar
harbor
and
im
glad
i
did
i
have
2
others
from
bar
harbor
brewing
co
and
im
excited
to
try
them
now
i
am
also
a
fan
of
bar
harbor
brewing
visited
their
little
home
brewery
a
few
years
ago
and
the
wife
gave
a
beer
lecture
while
the
husband
manned
the
brewing
equipment
in
the
basement
and
the
daughter
worked
the
gift
shop
cash
register
very
craft
and
ma
pa
now
they
rent
a
shop
tasting
room
near
all
the
action
in
downtown
bar
harbor
good
for
them
meh
thanks
for
the
shot
but
if
this
is
her
true
colors
our
relationship
ends
after
the
first
date
pours
a
pitch
black
near
opaque
color
with
a
slick
viscosity
to
it
really
silky
as
it
purse
and
leaves
a
tiny
tan
colored
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
collar
the
aromas
are
big
roasty
malts
some
brown
sugar
and
toasted
marshmallows
e
and
dark
chocolate
follow
the
flavors
have
a
nice
complexity
to
them
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
bitter
coffee
backbone
balances
this
out
a
hint
of
vanilla
bean
and
dry
finish
not
overly
carbonated
mouthfeel
which
was
nice
really
lives
up
to
the
hype
for
me
as
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
put
away
a
home
run
nicely
executed
less
bitter
than
more
commercial
dry
stouts
and
that
is
appealing
to
me
d
pretty
tasty
stout
although
im
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
would
buy
or
drink
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamed
coffeecolored
head
roasted
coffee
in
the
nose
with
chocolate
syrup
and
graham
roasty
flavor
up
front
with
more
syrup
and
a
smokey
aftertaste
light
bitterness
easy
to
drink
a
little
watery
and
short
in
the
finish
d
few
stouts
seem
as
well
rounded
as
this
one
time
to
make
a
friend
in
maine
medium
body
and
carbonation
what
this
stout
lacks
in
complexity
is
made
up
in
drinkability
it
is
modestly
carbonated
with
a
clean
almost
crisp
finish
some
alcohol
becomes
apparent
as
it
warms
that
blends
very
well
with
the
roasty
character
of
this
brew
very
drinkable
and
smooth
but
has
an
increasing
alcohol
character
that
warms
the
back
of
the
throat
this
beer
pours
a
wesley
snipes
dark
to
the
point
where
light
cant
escape
it
and
that
mamamamakes
me
happy
there
is
a
thin
tan
layer
of
foam
that
is
not
long
for
this
world
on
top
the
smell
is
of
some
interesting
rich
characters
i
detect
whiskey
coffee
dark
chocolate
pepper
tobacco
and
syrupy
cherry
the
taste
is
a
super
dark
chocolate
mocha
flavor
there
is
a
little
bit
of
maltiness
bitterness
which
seems
to
come
from
the
coffee
and
i
believe
there
was
a
cigar
tobacco
style
taste
in
the
back
i
thought
it
was
a
little
flat
on
the
tongue
but
perhaps
it
was
by
design
because
this
beer
was
a
very
smooth
stout
i
could
very
easily
kick
back
a
few
of
these
with
no
problems
at
all
vdubb
drinks
faster
than
me
i
cant
wait
for
some
of
our
future
tastings
lz
crew
what
this
brew
pours
a
dense
onyx
topped
by
a
small
outcropping
of
wan
foam
the
nose
comprises
large
amounts
of
roasted
malts
blackened
pretzels
molasses
brown
sugar
and
a
couple
puffs
o
smoke
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
roast
kicked
up
a
notch
some
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
added
and
the
char
upped
a
bit
as
well
the
body
is
a
very
heavy
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
chewy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
stout
one
i
wish
was
actually
available
around
these
parts
poured
from
a
bomber
bottle
into
my
larger
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
opaque
blackish
color
with
dark
tan
head
strong
scents
of
roasted
barley
almost
burnt
malts
and
coffee
this
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
is
smooth
creamy
milky
almost
silky
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
dark
chocolate
flavors
cooked
malts
and
coffee
flavors
mellow
hop
profile
is
noticed
i
have
drank
this
beer
a
number
of
times
in
maine
on
vacation
this
is
bottle
was
left
over
from
a
recent
trip
it
paired
well
with
a
roasted
turkey
sub
444
544
very
good
beer
simple
straightforward
but
with
enough
differentiation
to
keep
it
interesting
i
likes
note
since
this
has
come
out
in
6pks
ive
picked
up
a
few
very
drinkable
great
stuff
coming
out
of
me
drinkability
not
too
shabby
great
mix
of
sweet
dry
roast
and
tart
flavor
elements
not
a
gamechanger
for
the
style
but
a
quality
regular
ol
stout
glad
to
have
had
it
drinkability
love
the
sourness
of
it
and
if
every
bottle
is
supposed
to
be
like
this
then
i
would
absolutely
love
to
trade
for
more
however
since
i
doubt
that
i
would
like
to
try
another
bottle
to
see
what
the
differences
are
of
one
that
doesnt
have
these
tendencies
d
this
beer
is
caught
between
an
american
and
an
english
style
stout
and
it
thankfully
represents
the
best
of
both
great
feel
and
amazingly
complex
for
what
it
is
a
surprisingly
solid
offering
from
an
otherwise
quite
belowtheradar
brewery
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
though
hugely
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
great
full
bodied
stout
d
really
great
beer
a
classic
example
of
the
style
enough
taste
and
the
abv
is
super
reasonable
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
could
get
it
wow
this
one
makes
me
proud
to
be
a
native
of
maine
just
an
outstanding
stout
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
nice
small
tan
head
aroma
is
not
much
maybe
a
little
toasty
coffee
flavor
is
great
very
nice
sweet
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
hardly
any
bitterness
from
this
one
just
a
nice
sweet
toffee
finish
suberb
this
is
one
of
the
best
ever
this
one
is
too
easy
to
drink
stock
up
on
these
when
you
see
them
d
insanely
drinkable
before
i
realized
it
half
of
my
glass
was
gone
i
thought
maybe
the
dog
stuck
her
head
in
and
snuck
some
when
i
wasnt
looking
but
shes
passed
out
snoring
on
the
floor
so
i
must
have
gone
through
it
quicker
than
i
thought
wish
i
had
more
of
this
i
will
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
see
it
a
solid
drinking
stout
no
issues
having
another
d
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
regardless
of
style
this
is
an
allweather
daily
drinker
imo
drinkability
its
drinkable
like
i
said
before
it
could
have
been
thicker
into
a
pint
glass
poured
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
poor
retention
but
decent
lacing
very
roasted
malty
and
coffee
in
the
nose
with
some
hints
of
cocoa
powder
and
dark
chocolate
the
taste
confirmed
the
nose
with
the
coffee
and
roast
flavors
somewhat
dominating
and
progressing
to
a
dry
cocoa
powder
finish
my
big
knock
on
this
beer
is
the
body
too
thin
for
a
stout
but
smooth
with
very
little
carbonation
this
would
be
a
tremendous
session
stout
if
the
body
were
just
a
tad
bit
thicker
but
still
a
great
stout
nonetheless
mfd
light
sizzle
of
carbonation
smooth
when
it
hits
the
tongue
smoky
flavor
overwhelms
the
tastebuds
making
this
a
singular
beer
di
definitely
like
it
a
lot
not
my
favorite
stout
but
its
damn
close
excellent
md
very
smooth
light
carbonation
great
roasted
malt
flavors
on
the
palate
very
enjoyable
to
drink
up
there
with
the
best
stouts
ive
had
this
has
the
typical
characteristics
of
a
stout
but
they
are
all
improved
upon
drinkability
good
carbonation
for
a
stout
which
keeps
it
surprisingly
drinkable
could
have
three
of
these
on
a
big
night
though
i
would
be
full
truly
a
great
beer
sucks
i
can
only
get
it
once
a
summer
when
i
actually
present
in
maine
drinkability
wish
this
was
one
of
the
old
bombers
12
ounces
is
simply
not
enough
right
up
there
with
kalamazoo
stout
from
bells
which
this
most
reminded
me
of
with
all
the
imperial
stouts
i
find
myself
drinking
these
days
its
great
to
have
a
nonoverpowering
yet
flavorful
and
smooth
as
this
one
d
really
great
here
a
dark
very
roasty
beer
that
you
can
session
available
at
a
great
6pk
price
right
up
there
with
sierra
nevada
as
one
of
my
favorite
really
affordable
american
stouts
d
very
easy
to
drink
in
fact
mine
disappeared
way
too
quickly
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
with
every
meal
bar
harbor
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
and
im
glad
that
atlantic
is
keeping
it
alive
as
it
was
originally
brewed
d
a
solid
stout
that
is
so
smooth
and
balanced
easy
to
enjoy
and
drink
i
would
have
this
over
a
guinness
any
day
wonderfully
drinkable
stout
and
a
shame
i
cant
get
this
locally
this
beer
appears
a
near
black
shade
with
a
nice
big
head
atop
the
beer
retention
and
lacing
are
very
nice
as
well
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
already
want
to
go
out
and
buy
more
this
is
quite
possibly
my
new
favorite
lower
abv
stout
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
perhaps
even
a
splash
of
chocolate
comprise
the
aromas
and
taste
alcohol
is
hidden
extremely
well
highly
recommended
cadillac
mountain
is
an
amazing
dryish
stout
from
an
otherwise
rather
average
brewery
i
dont
know
exactly
what
magic
is
going
on
in
this
bottle
but
this
is
an
exemplary
stout
one
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
again
and
again
whats
more
its
delicious
three
cheers
all
around
to
this
american
classic
drinks
ok
the
less
than
stellar
finish
is
tough
to
drink
at
times
constantly
let
down
by
regular
stouts
the
mouthfeel
is
usually
what
turns
me
off
but
with
this
one
i
thought
it
lacked
any
pleasant
tastes
and
the
feel
was
just
way
off
i
guess
american
stouts
really
arent
my
thing
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
really
smooth
beer
is
slightly
bitter
at
the
back
end
but
finishes
cleanly
and
isnt
dry
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
with
high
drinkability
overall
di
guess
i
have
been
on
such
an
imperial
stout
kick
of
late
that
i
may
have
been
expecting
too
much
from
this
brew
i
was
going
to
give
it
a
4
but
i
think
my
palate
was
not
being
quite
fair
to
this
one
and
additionally
i
may
have
served
this
a
little
too
warm
either
way
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
and
in
terms
of
a
more
subtle
toned
down
stout
a
terrific
beer
recommended
definitely
worth
getting
if
youre
in
the
area
unfortunately
they
dont
ship
off
the
island
so
if
youre
there
grab
a
case
or
two
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
american
stout
that
is
certainly
worthy
of
its
praise
very
glad
that
they
have
decided
to
distribute
in
my
area
recommended
overall
a
very
good
stout
lots
of
interesting
earth
tones
for
me
in
the
nose
and
palate
that
really
made
this
one
stand
out
try
it
if
you
can
world
class
big
stout
the
key
here
is
complexity
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
flavor
is
not
great
but
good
creamy
milk
and
coffee
almost
resembles
an
iced
coffee
light
mouthfeel
mild
carbonation
not
boozy
in
the
least
as
the
beer
warms
the
coffee
flavors
become
even
stronger
but
seems
to
bland
out
overall
but
in
the
end
a
decent
stout
d
insanely
drinkable
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
ever
had
db
a
good
price
for
a
stout
that
has
great
drinkability
before
its
importation
to
ma
i
thought
this
one
was
gonna
be
bigger
for
some
reason
turns
out
it
is
just
a
dangerously
sessionable
stout
with
good
balance
overall
great
brew
not
really
my
style
of
choice
as
i
usually
drink
bigger
beers
but
i
am
glad
i
purchased
a
few
more
bombers
as
i
will
be
visiting
it
again
soon
appears
black
once
in
the
glass
just
a
small
head
forms
and
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
skim
of
bubbles
some
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
has
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
coffee
and
grassy
hops
not
the
most
potent
of
aromas
but
smells
stoutlike
anyways
flavor
follows
aroma
with
elements
of
chocolate
and
coffee
a
good
malty
flavored
stout
i
detect
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
no
alcohol
is
detected
the
body
is
not
as
full
as
i
like
in
a
stout
just
feels
a
bit
thin
and
watery
and
not
really
stoutstrength
good
flavor
and
very
drinkable
lacking
in
a
few
areas
but
overall
a
nice
beer
drinks
ok
would
like
a
fuller
thicker
stout
experience
to
accompany
the
dark
malt
and
coffee
flavors
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
pours
an
opaque
obsidian
with
a
moderate
white
head
bit
of
lacing
sweet
coffee
and
chocolate
rule
the
nose
but
very
subtle
sweet
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
are
up
front
the
flavor
fades
a
bit
with
the
lingering
finish
the
brew
is
medium
in
body
mildly
carbonated
and
a
fine
brew
an
all
around
great
american
stout
picked
up
a
6pack
at
julios
last
week
glad
to
see
this
available
in
ma
now
12
oz
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
my
2nd
out
of
the
6pack
an
aggressive
pour
leads
way
to
a
huge
3
fingers
or
so
tan
head
beer
appearance
is
black
eventually
settles
down
to
about
1
finger
very
nice
and
creamy
retains
the
whole
time
but
lacking
in
the
lace
department
smell
is
unfortunately
weak
reminds
me
of
an
irish
dry
stout
milk
chocolate
cream
not
offensive
by
any
means
but
theres
not
much
to
it
its
weird
the
first
sip
is
amazing
but
seems
to
go
downhill
after
that
im
getting
faint
coffee
with
cream
oats
rich
chocolate
a
small
amount
of
hops
noticeable
tastier
coffee
notes
appear
in
the
aftertaste
bitter
finish
the
taste
is
decent
but
overall
it
seems
very
average
mouthfeel
is
fine
low
carbonation
no
complaints
drinks
easily
and
smoothly
but
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
overall
decent
but
quite
a
letdown
if
i
did
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
never
guess
this
beer
was
in
the
top
100
recently
if
only
the
whole
beer
drank
like
the
aftertaste
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
much
at
all
this
beer
was
a
little
hyped
up
before
i
tried
it
so
my
drinking
experience
may
be
skewed
i
think
that
overall
its
a
great
beer
that
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
of
a
standard
american
stout
however
i
did
not
find
anything
absolutely
outstanding
about
this
beer
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
extra
special
for
me
maybe
im
spoiled
on
coffee
stouts
and
imperial
stouts
i
dont
know
i
can
say
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
fall
or
winter
sitting
around
the
fire
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
d
i
thought
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
stout
and
very
easy
to
drink
great
chocolate
smell
and
taste
and
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
would
love
to
have
again
d
big
on
flavor
but
easy
drinking
and
at
6
7
abv
this
one
could
go
down
as
almost
a
session
beer
if
your
a
big
guy
like
me
but
not
quite
im
glad
i
tried
this
its
not
complex
but
its
something
i
would
seek
out
from
time
to
time
my
favorite
part
is
the
french
vanilla
thing
this
has
going
a
light
stout
to
celebrate
the
end
of
winter
and
looking
forward
for
more
i
wonder
when
bar
harbor
is
going
to
come
to
philly
f
pretty
dry
with
just
a
touch
of
lingering
sweet
maltiness
with
that
is
a
long
lingering
roasted
flavor
with
a
little
more
coffee
and
chocolate
milk
tons
of
bitterness
and
earthy
charred
malt
flavors
with
some
tangy
spicy
acidic
bitterness
touch
of
sticky
sweetness
as
well
with
how
drinkable
it
is
and
lower
abv
i
could
put
tons
of
these
back
no
problem
the
charred
astringent
earthy
bitterness
takes
away
from
it
a
little
not
bad
a
little
above
average
the
flavor
dissapoints
a
bit
d
this
beer
drinks
very
good
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
make
this
a
couple
bomber
beer
before
going
to
something
else
i
have
always
wondered
what
made
this
beer
get
so
high
of
ratings
before
and
now
i
understand
this
beer
is
very
very
well
made
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
sparse
whitish
head
smells
of
raisins
and
dry
roasted
barley
tastes
vinous
with
light
amounts
of
roast
and
raisin
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
why
is
it
so
many
highly
rated
beers
are
rated
highly
purely
because
of
their
similarity
to
wine
this
is
a
good
tasting
brew
solid
for
a
regional
brewery
feel
is
on
the
lighter
side
than
i
want
carbonation
is
mediumfull
there
are
some
good
clean
flavors
here
and
fairly
light
body
makes
it
easy
to
consume
this
is
probably
the
best
element
of
the
beer
it
is
a
stout
with
good
flavor
but
also
something
that
can
just
be
drank
ill
drink
to
that
my
first
offering
from
bar
harbor
and
its
a
good
one
in
this
era
of
imperial
everything
im
happy
to
find
a
nice
well
crafted
stout
that
is
nice
and
easy
to
drink
and
holds
my
interest
at
the
same
time
very
happy
to
try
this
a
session
stout
if
there
ever
was
one
just
a
great
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
if
this
were
available
in
my
area
i
would
definitely
look
for
it
just
to
always
have
some

really
comes
through
giving

possessing

some

seems
to
peak

show
the

as
the
chocolate
and
roasted
flavors
come
through
highlighting
some

flavors
then
finishing
with

of

rounds
out

was

further
down

roastedchocolate
flavors
noticeable
from
the
first
drop
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
jreitmanapr
10
nice
stout
wouldnt
take
it
over
a
guinness
if
youre
choosing
popular
stouts
in
ireland
but
its
good
for
a
change
a
nice
burnt
bitter
taste
to
it
the
head
on
the
beer
is
quite
nice
overall
would
definitely
drink
again
truely
the
best
irish
stout
upon
the
first
sup
one
cannot
help
but
fall
in
love
with
the
spicy
and
cinnamon
flavour
that
it
has
to
offer
beyond
the
white
foamy
head
which
lasts
way
longer
than
the
guinness
head
best
place
to
sample
this
delightful
irish
stout
is
in
its
homeland
of
cork
hands
down
my
favorite
stout
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
especially
due
to
its
lightbodied
nature
tough
to
find
these
days
great
wonderful
spectacular
irish
beer
i
love
it
anyway
i
can
get
it
nice
change
from
guinness
and
murphys
just
cause
why
not
was
my
first
pint
in
ireland
at
the
shannon
airport
directly
off
the
red
eye
flight
from
boston
instant
love
with
this
beer
not
as
available
really
anyway
compared
to
guinness
or
murphys
but
that
is
what
you
beer
snob
dweebs
are
pretty
much
into
yeah
go
out
getcha
some
beamish
if
you
can
find
it
and
let
me
know
where
in
the
us
it
was
found
irelands
finest
stout
much
nicer
than
guinness
i
could
drink
a
dozen
of
these
and
still
want
more
personally
i
find
it
more
refreshing
and
easier
to
drink
than
the
world
famous
guinness
if
in
ireland
i
would
reccomend
buying
one
of
these
before
guinness
they
are
just
as
widely
availible
as
the
other
legendary
stout
it
is
famous
for
being
slightly
cheaper
too
i
wouldnt
buy
this
from
a
can
or
bottle
though
completely
different
drink
buy
it
buy
it
now
dark
brownblack
pour
nitro
bubbles
cascaded
along
the
glass
settling
as
a
firm
creamy
tan
cap
that
retained
well
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
coffee
notes
and
not
much
else
pretty
standard
stuff
for
the
style
taste
was
malty
and
dry
woody
coffee
bitterness
and
some
unsweetened
chocolate
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
a
decent
beer
the
poor
mans
guinness
im
sorry
if
my
review
wasnt
any
good
its
just
a
laymans
opinion
o
combination
of
cream
and
red
ale
qualities
once
you
taste
it
it
clearly
is
not
guinness
quite
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
and
a
ton
more
strong
porter
like
flavors
lots
of
coffee
and
dryness
i
enjoyed
having
something
other
than
guinness
and
i
would
drink
it
again
if
we
had
the
option
in
the
states
id
probably
just
drink
guinness
on
tap
roasted
and
heavy
malt
aromas
pours
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
longlasting
creamy
some
lacework
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
taste
is
malty
coffee
chocolate
and
some
roasty
nice
dry
finish
looks
like
a
stout
should
with
a
fine
off
white
thick
head
which
stays
until
the
last
drop
of
beer
has
gone
quite
a
nice
beer
comments
if
guinness
is
the
benchmark
this
stout
exceeds
the
mark
on
all
accounts
but
one
the
lactic
acid
sourness
i
know
my
irish
cousins
will
scream
heresy
but
in
all
honesty
this
beer
is
better
than
guinness
and
makes
murphys
seem
like
a
poor
excuse
for
stout
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
that
would
make
this
beer
better
is
a
good
soft
lactobacillus
culture
this
was
partly
due
to
a
succession
of
ok
pints
of
its
blander
cousin
guinness
but
next
time
in
the
old
country
i
will
definetly
seek
beamish
out
again
o
very
impressive
i
want
another
six
breakfast
the
beautiful
lass
that
poured
this
as
my
breakfast
will
no
doubt
skew
my
review
i
wrote
our
initials
in
the
thick
head
as
i
quaffed
this
brew
the
initials
survived
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
swear
i
could
taste
banana
slightly
sweet
heavenly
aroma
the
tantalizing
flavors
danced
on
all
areas
of
my
tongue
with
the
exception
of
sour
whoops
time
for
brunch
ill
have
another
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
a
creamy
surging
head
on
top
these
beers
look
beautiful
every
time
the
lacing
is
just
like
a
guinness
or
murphys
the
smell
is
a
toasted
and
earthy
the
flavor
is
roasted
with
a
good
amount
of
nut
and
earthy
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
overall
this
beer
is
one
i
would
love
to
have
again
i
had
one
can
of
this
in
2008
and
kind
of
miss
it
one
day
itll
find
its
way
back
to
my
fridge
now
this
is
beer
damn
good
stuff
i
got
to
try
this
with
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
probably
end
up
being
my
favorite
dessert
i
lived
in
cork
ireland
for
6
months
and
had
literally
hundreds
of
these
on
tap
absolutely
love
it
ive
also
had
it
from
the
can
a
few
times
and
while
still
good
its
not
the
same
of
course
if
youre
ever
in
southern
ireland
do
yourself
a
favor
and
have
the
local
brew
o
pleasant
not
something
i
want
everyday
but
pleasant
poured
from
a
440ml
nitrocan
into
a
pint
glass
this
stout
poured
a
deep
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
nitro
induced
head
that
would
not
fade
some
light
lacing
was
left
around
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
stout
consisted
of
both
sweet
and
roasted
malt
mild
coffee
and
a
few
chocolate
notes
the
flavor
was
very
creamy
with
notes
of
light
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
the
roasted
malt
flavor
was
very
mild
when
compared
to
other
dry
stouts
the
mouthfeel
was
lightbodied
with
typical
nitro
creaminess
and
minimal
carbonation
this
was
a
decent
and
very
sessionable
stout
overall
a
great
irish
stout
and
a
nice
change
from
guinness
and
i
think
cheaper
3
50
euro
vs
4
50
euro
for
guinness
i
could
drink
no
more
than
a
few
in
a
sitting
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
creamy
that
sounds
like
a
contradiction
but
i
am
sticking
to
my
statement
overall
easily
drinkable
and
pleasant
da
pretty
nice
dry
stout
thats
light
enough
to
have
a
couple
of
but
complex
enough
that
its
not
boring
drinkability
guinness
draught
has
a
definite
leg
up
with
its
multiple
notes
and
flavors
all
of
which
are
balanced
better
if
youre
after
an
irish
stout
youre
best
off
reaching
for
guinness
overall
a
great
beer
and
highly
recommended
to
any
stout
lover
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
with
a
thick
foamy
light
beige
nitrohead
sweet
smokey
roasted
malt
and
toffee
aromas
light
bodied
very
low
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
creamy
buttery
feel
roasted
malt
and
caramel
flavors
with
a
lightly
bitter
and
dry
finish
not
bad
seems
to
be
true
to
the
style
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
low
carbonation
ales
aside
from
the
beautiful
pour
and
impressive
head
retention
the
nitro
beers
just
dont
do
it
for
me
taste
amazingly
thin
and
keeps
getting
thinner
very
creamy
for
the
lack
of
thickness
a
smooth
smoky
thin
stout
without
any
degree
of
bitterness
of
hops
but
throughout
its
just
tough
to
get
over
the
thin
body
for
this
beer
makes
it
more
drinkable
but
the
difficulty
in
finding
this
stuff
as
well
as
the
price
makes
it
a
little
cost
prohibitive
for
something
this
thin
thanks
1
for
the
sample
a
quote
from
lewis
carroll
and
has
thou
slain
the
jabberwock
come
to
my
arms
my
beamish
boy
o
frabjous
day
callooh
callay
he
chortled
in
his
joy
d
this
is
not
as
good
as
guinness
but
fairly
close
it
is
equal
to
murphys
and
better
than
youngs
in
the
battle
of
the
nitrocan
stout
a
close
2nd
in
this
shootout
similar
but
superior
to
murphys
subtle
differences
between
this
and
guinness
and
they
are
both
quite
good
guinness
gets
a
slight
nod
due
to
better
appearance
and
aroma
availability
and
price
also
help
the
classic
from
st
james
gate
take
the
victory
in
the
shootout
still
very
glad
to
finally
be
able
to
try
beamish
after
years
of
hunting
a
solid
silver
medal
winner
in
my
book
d
really
not
bad
for
what
it
is
some
hop
character
shows
through
in
the
finish
which
is
a
bit
unusual
for
the
style
but
adds
depth
a
bit
lacking
in
malt
character
but
with
a
rich
coffee
roast
preferable
to
guinness
but
unfortunately
much
harder
to
find
this
would
easily
be
my
go
to
stout
if
it
were
still
widely
available
but
right
now
its
a
little
tough
to
find
much
better
than
guinness
after
cracking
the
widget
and
pouring
into
a
guinness
imperial
pint
glass
you
get
that
perfect
irish
stout
look
clear
delineation
between
jet
black
beer
and
light
tan
head
about
a
12
inch
thick
there
isnt
much
to
the
aroma
just
some
roasted
malt
a
little
soapy
there
is
a
little
coffee
taste
and
a
little
chocolate
taste
but
neither
is
significant
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
clean
finish
dry
irish
stouts
are
one
of
the
more
perfect
beers
when
you
plan
to
drink
about
ten
of
them
goes
down
light
and
easy
on
tap
at
the
cambridge
brew
pub
nice
creamy
guiness
looking
head
dark
body
a
little
bigger
body
than
a
guiness
but
not
much
not
much
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
cream
and
the
drinkability
at
4
1
percent
abv
is
huge
when
trying
to
keep
up
with
soupedupdiesel
and
larsonstyle
at
the
bar
this
one
really
came
in
handy
im
still
disappointed
the
moonbeam
stout
was
kicked
and
i
didnt
have
the
opportunity
to
get
a
second
shot
at
it
very
good
drinkability
nothing
too
exciting
but
a
great
session
beer
d
a
wonderful
session
beer
could
drink
this
all
day
pours
pretty
much
opaque
jet
black
with
a
super
creamy
tan
head
from
its
nitro
can
aroma
is
muted
but
i
clearly
detect
chalky
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
character
taste
is
also
quite
mild
with
some
acrid
bitterness
roasted
coffee
and
a
tad
of
biscuity
malt
can
be
identified
chalky
with
only
the
rumor
of
hops
i
find
it
much
like
many
other
dry
irish
stouts
to
be
quite
thirst
quenching
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
super
creamy
thanks
the
widget
slightly
chewy
but
finishes
with
just
a
tinge
of
sour
not
sticky
at
all
like
others
of
this
style
i
could
down
these
one
after
another
all
in
all
i
enjoy
this
more
than
guinness
but
it
does
not
stand
up
to
well
made
fresh
american
craft
examples
the
drinkability
is
almost
a
foregone
conclusion
irish
drys
may
be
the
best
session
ales
in
the
world
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
prominent
renditions
picked
up
a
4
pack
of
cans
for
st
pattys
day
served
in
guinness
glasses
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
thick
creamy
white
heady
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
right
where
the
liquid
meets
the
head
classic
looking
stout
decent
roasted
malt
smell
great
flavor
more
toasted
malt
and
slight
coffee
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
is
pretty
satisfying
has
to
be
one
of
the
creamiest
beers
from
a
can
at
the
end
the
foam
left
in
the
glass
slid
down
the
side
at
a
glacial
pace
it
was
thick
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
low
abv
made
me
wish
this
was
a
6
pack
da
delicious
beer
with
a
great
taste
that
can
easily
be
enjoyed
all
night
this
is
an
irish
favorite
of
mine
nothing
flashy
here
but
an
all
around
easy
drinker
the
taste
is
a
tad
dryer
that
guinness
in
the
nitro
and
i
find
more
enjoyable
that
murphys
she
comes
out
the
can
black
as
night
creamy
off
white
head
with
some
of
the
tiniest
bubbles
seen
i
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
having
this
one
on
draft
but
given
the
opportunity
i
would
be
all
over
it
light
aromas
of
coffee
and
chocolate
come
though
the
glass
and
beg
to
be
taken
in
with
large
gulps
beamish
is
one
of
those
stouts
i
can
drink
all
night
goes
great
in
half
and
halfs
and
never
do
i
feel
bloated
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
the
dark
roasted
characters
meld
the
ale
into
coffee
like
candy
treat
raise
this
one
on
st
pattys
and
leave
the
rest
of
the
green
macro
in
the
dust
more
hops
than
expected
on
the
palate
with
toasty
malt
roast
makes
an
appearance
throughout
the
drink
finishes
dry
as
expected
unique
brew
absurdly
easy
to
drink
could
quaff
this
even
on
the
hotest
of
days
d
this
beer
drinks
well
but
is
a
little
heavy
for
a
stout
not
something
to
be
chugged
or
thrown
into
a
carbomb
for
sure
enjoy
this
beer
and
sip
it
smooth
this
really
is
a
mild
easy
drinking
stout
and
was
my
go
to
draft
while
vacationing
in
ireland
years
ago
love
it
from
the
can
to
a
pint
glass
pours
black
with
a
very
light
tan
head
kind
of
has
that
picture
perfect
irish
pint
look
you
see
for
the
advertisements
for
irish
stouts
the
head
leaves
a
lacing
on
the
glass
and
stays
till
the
last
drop
great
retention
the
smell
is
pretty
typical
and
what
i
would
expect
for
the
style
a
nice
roasted
smell
and
this
one
smells
great
there
is
also
some
chocolate
in
there
as
well
nothing
strong
but
its
there
the
taste
like
the
smell
was
pretty
predictable
a
nice
light
roasted
flavor
that
small
hint
of
chocolate
and
unlike
the
smell
i
got
just
a
dab
of
coffee
as
well
nice
refreshing
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
really
creamy
i
wouldnt
say
its
thick
but
its
definitely
not
thin
kind
of
almost
chewy
but
more
creamier
than
anything
drinkability
is
high
for
this
one
with
a
abv
lower
than
bud
light
kicking
back
a
few
of
these
wouldnt
be
a
problem
this
one
definitely
contends
with
guinness
and
murphys
not
sure
which
of
the
three
i
like
best
but
all
are
great
overall
this
one
is
great
will
pick
up
some
more
whenever
i
get
the
chance
value
b
pretty
drinkable
a
nice
low
abv
beer
but
nothing
special
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
wonderful
water
chemistry
with
a
bit
of
chalky
bicarbonate
and
dry
calcium
which
you
can
really
notice
in
the
mouthfeel
really
enjoyable
worthy
of
a
bit
session
its
almost
a
perfect
stout
not
the
most
exciting
beer
but
one
you
can
enjoy
the
crap
out
of
definitely
my
favorite
stout
of
the
big
irish
3
not
a
bad
stout
but
you
could
find
a
little
better
drinkability
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
its
certainly
something
i
could
get
again
i
was
quite
satisfied
overall
this
style
traditionally
leans
towards
non
offensive
and
easy
drinking
this
beer
follows
suit
to
the
letter
pours
a
muddy
brown
followed
by
an
always
nice
to
watch
cascading
leaving
black
liquid
with
a
white
head
that
has
the
look
and
consistancy
of
heavy
cream
the
creamy
head
sticks
it
out
to
the
finish
and
coats
the
pint
all
the
way
down
theres
next
to
nothing
in
the
nose
taste
was
typical
irish
stout
i
suppose
very
bland
almost
tinny
theres
a
hint
of
maltiness
and
maybe
some
mild
sweetness
but
the
bitter
dry
finish
somewhat
mutes
that
point
the
feel
is
thin
and
watery
in
a
way
it
is
rather
smooth
however
though
it
would
be
easy
to
pound
these
back
you
would
likely
be
left
unsatisified
by
the
lack
of
flavour
and
the
odd
viscosity
im
fairly
convinced
that
i
will
never
realize
the
true
beauty
of
an
irish
stout
until
i
cross
the
pond
and
partake
of
them
in
their
native
splender
notes
not
sure
if
the
recipe
has
changed
since
the
murphys
takeover
or
if
my
palate
has
evolved
since
i
last
had
one
of
these
i
remember
liking
it
more
than
guinness
back
in
the
day
and
enjoyed
it
ontap
when
i
was
in
ireland
about
9
years
ago
but
now
i
dont
really
have
a
lot
thats
positive
to
say
about
this
at
least
the
can
was
free
i
knew
this
wouldnt
be
a
shining
example
of
the
style
but
it
more
than
met
my
expectations
if
it
were
more
widely
available
and
less
expensive
i
could
see
it
staying
in
my
refrigerator
goes
great
with
lord
of
the
rings
marathons
d
well
balanced
and
a
perfect
session
stout
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
probably
my
favorite
irish
dry
stout
were
it
more
available
id
probably
be
drinking
beamish
much
more
often
pours
out
a
very
deep
black
with
only
minor
hints
of
rubyred
at
the
edges
of
my
pint
glass
nitro
bubblies
take
a
while
to
settle
and
are
bigger
and
whiter
than
is
typical
for
the
nitrodraft
poured
stout
eventually
settles
into
a
tight
and
thick
head
which
lasts
the
entire
pint
and
leaves
rings
of
lace
the
whole
way
down
smell
is
typically
underwhelming
roasted
malt
and
light
chocolate
and
the
flavour
profile
follows
slightly
bitter
with
a
dry
bite
in
the
background
but
not
quite
so
bitter
as
the
other
big
irish
stouts
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
just
a
little
too
thin
and
drinkability
is
fantastic
my
personal
favourite
of
the
three
popular
irish
dry
stouts
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
very
drinkable
brew
that
you
can
put
back
repeatedly
almost
too
much
like
water
not
complex
at
all
but
good
while
it
lasts
had
to
try
this
one
out
because
i
had
never
had
it
before
found
it
at
an
old
chicago
out
of
town
on
a
beerventure
very
similar
to
guinness
except
i
dont
know
if
i
had
just
killed
my
palate
with
stronger
beers
by
the
time
i
drank
this
one
but
it
seemed
to
me
almost
flat
black
as
can
be
with
a
thick
creamy
off
white
foam
forming
at
the
top
this
is
just
what
a
nitro
irish
stout
was
meant
to
be
while
i
didnt
enjoy
it
at
the
time
i
would
say
that
this
beer
falls
in
the
average
range
of
the
style
and
type
that
its
supposed
to
be
very
smooth
almost
creamy
and
not
too
strong
if
you
like
this
kind
of
beer
i
dont
see
why
you
couldnt
drink
something
like
this
all
night
im
more
for
the
stronger
stouts
so
there
it
is
average
but
drinkable
taste
very
much
a
roasted
taste
but
it
has
a
little
bit
of
a
watered
down
feel
to
it
the
carbonation
is
very
low
and
the
body
is
very
light
the
corbonation
is
perfect
in
this
brew
all
the
elements
work
well
and
complement
each
other
likewise
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
you
could
easily
drink
this
beer
all
night
d
i
could
certainly
session
this
guy
d
the
quote
of
the
night
sums
it
all
up
its
like
roasted
water
its
just
lacking
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
categories
im
always
going
to
be
blown
away
by
the
appearance
the
nitro
widget
gives
and
the
aromas
are
wonderful
but
the
taste
it
is
just
not
quite
there
poured
from
a
nitrocan
into
a
pint
glass
at
paddys
pub
in
milwaukee
wi
the
body
was
black
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
was
faint
but
smelled
of
sweet
chocolate
and
cream
light
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
flavors
of
sweet
malt
but
also
a
roasted
malt
finish
very
good
drinkability
mfd
very
very
drinkable
light
enough
for
a
session
beer
and
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
drink
a
few
of
definitely
will
be
picking
up
a
couple
of
these
next
chance
i
get
drinkability
not
bad
a
smooth
mild
lightly
flavored
irish
stout
with
a
sensible
amount
of
alcohol
from
a
14
9
oz
nitro
can
pours
a
black
color
with
a
creamy
12
inch
head
light
malty
aroma
taste
of
malts
with
some
hints
of
coffee
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
nthis
is
not
a
beer
i
could
spend
the
night
drinking
overall
a
fairly
mediocre
brew
this
is
an
easily
quaffable
beer
and
a
fine
companion
for
long
sessions
or
billiards
drinkability
the
relatively
light
body
and
subtle
flavors
make
this
quite
drinkable
but
i
would
think
it
would
be
easily
overpowered
by
most
pub
foods
if
consumed
in
such
a
setting
d
a
good
mouthfeel
and
taste
combo
especially
for
the
style
despite
the
thickness
i
found
myself
drinking
this
beer
quite
voraciously
and
could
not
wait
of
have
another
a
great
tasting
beer
that
goes
down
quite
easily
a
decent
dry
irish
nitro
stout
notes
of
the
big
three
nitro
stouts
guinness
murphys
and
beamish
beamish
is
my
favorite
d
a
long
time
favorite
of
mine
and
probably
the
easiest
stout
to
session
d
delicious
straight
from
ireland
the
real
deal
d
goes
down
so
damn
smooth
i
found
myself
wanting
to
drink
more
just
so
that
i
could
maintain
the
slick
feel
in
my
mouth

easier
to
drink
than
water
this
one
is
harder
for
me
to
find
than
the
other
well
known
draught
stouts
guinness
and
murphys
but
i
think
it
has
quickly
become
my
favorite
the
smell
is
fruity
esters
and
roasted
barley
very
pleasant
all
of
the
big
three
draught
stouts
tend
to
have
a
watery
mouthfeel
but
this
one
seems
just
a
bit
fuller
and
creamier
than
the
other
two
roasted
barley
bitterness
is
there
but
not
as
overt
as
guinness
and
murphys
and
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
more
prevalent
in
beamish
i
declare
this
the
most
drinkable
draught
stout
yet
bravo
better
than
the
other
dry
irish
born
stouts
imo
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
very
thin
beer
in
general
the
carbonation
breaks
early
in
the

then
goes
quickly
and
smoothly
down
the
throat
an
easy
session
beer
for
the
enthusiast
looking
for
more
bittering
and
a
roastier
finish
great
stuff
i
can
only
find
it
at
a
famous
west
michigan
irish
pub
on
tap
ive
never
seen
it
anywhere
else
in
the
us
way
better
than
guiness
in
my
opinion
more
everything
i
still
prefer
sierra
nevada
and
murphys
stout
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
well
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
once
i
finish
staring
at
it
and
actually
drink
the
thing
beamish
has
a
smooth
creaminess
that
i
have
not
seen
replicated
anywhere
heavily
roasted
barley
gives
it
at
rich
complex
almost
meaty
flavor
i
hesitate
to
call
a
beer
meaty
creamy
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
had
a
very
well
balanced
aftertaste
like

this

it

npt
as

as

mouthfeel
is
creamy
dry
and
finishes

with

this

really

i
could

this
all

doesnt

either
definitely
a
hell
of
an
afternoon
beer
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
nitrostyle
beer
as
it
typically
kills
off
a
lot
of
flavor
but
the
beamish
really
holds
up
well
to
the
creamy
nitro
drinkability
is
fairly
high
a
simple
stout
pleasing
flavors
enjoyable
and
easily
sessionable
no
major
complaints
d
this
is
one
you
can
pound
a
nice
solid
session
stout
and
on
par
with
the
murpheys
and
guinnesses
of
the
world
as
a
note
the
head
on
this
beer
held
until
the
last
drink
from
the
glass
now
thats
impressive
good
irish
dry
stout
have
to
say
it
looks
better
than
guinness
out
of
the
tap
at
least
here
in
the
states
dark
with
slight
head
bitter
like
dark
chocolate
but
not
heavy
or
thick
bubbly
light
but
substantial
mouthfeel
like
the
bitterness
and
the
chocolate
more
than
guinness
d
easy
drinking
tasty
and
low
abv
makes
a
great
session
beer
beamish
is
far
and
away
my
favorite
of
the
big
3
irish
stouts
i
prefer
the
sweetness
and
clean
finish
to
guinness
and
murphys
though
they
are
all
quite
similar
bought
a
nitrocan
guinness
and
a
nitrocan
beamish
and
did
a
taste
test
both
poured
from
the
cans
with
the
usual
hiss
of
the
nitro
pellet
in
a
nice
foamy
stream
both
looked
about
the
same
in
the
glass
once
settled
with
a
massive
rich
foamy
head
on
top
the
beamish
a
bit
more
tan
and
the
guinness
more
gray
and
a
deep
brown
to
black
with
ruby
highlights
below
little
carbonation
visible
smell
was
similar
just
a
touch
of
smoky
malts
initial
tastes
were
quite
different
beamish
was
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
well
balanced
drinkable
mix
of
malt
flavors
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
made
it
very
easy
to
drinktop
to
bottom
the
guinness
was
similar
but
with
a
bit
more
hops
bitterness
that
soon
turned
to
a
metallic
hint
of
alcohol
as
it
warmed
definitely
enjoyed
both
of
them
who
wouldnt
but
the
beamish
was
a
tad
bit
better
imho
matched
nicely
with
a
beamish
burger
at
delaneys
served
in
a
beamish
pint
glass
nice
pour
jet
black
with
a
creamy
ivory
head
mild
malty
aroma
taste
is
nicely
balanced
sweet
malty
a
little
bit
of
coffee
very
easy
drinking
the
perfect
choice
for
lunch
on
a
cold
day
d
this
is
a
good
irish
stout
very
sessionable
and
tasty
comment
i
did
a
taste
test
between
this
and
murphys
a
hard
choice
to
pick
one
both
are
great
beers
beamish
is
a
little
sweeter
with
less
carbonation
than
murphys
i
recommend
both
highly
d
this
is
another
uneven
beer
in
my
eyes
the
taste
was
simply
too
uninteresting
and
thin
to
be
likable
this
is
such
a
yummy
beer
the
taste
reminds
me
of
carob
the
head
is
very
creamy
and
lasts
the
entire
time
much
like
a
guinness
draught
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
lends
itself
to
being
served
cold
as
opposed
to
some
lesser
beers
that
need
to
be
served
cold
simply
to
mask
their
weakness
i
definitely
recommend
this
d
the
somewhat
low4
4abv
and
the
smoothness
make
this
very
drinkable
this
is
what
i
would
probably
give
someone
interested
in
trying
a
true
irish
stout
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
of
stouts
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
pass
one
up
i
could
also
see
myself
picking
up
a
four
pack
when
i
was
in
the
mood
its
pretty
good
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
great
beer
gc
pouring
the
beer
produces
a
sudsy
brown
concoction
that
kind
of
looks
like
sludge
at
first
but
ends
in
a
cola
black
colored
beer
with
a
lite
tan
head
that
maintains
a
1
centimeter
head
smells
chocolatey
with
maybe
a
hint
of
birch
taste
is
slightly
sweet
but
a
little
bland
compared
to
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
almost
like
sherbert
overall
nothing
offensive
to
hurt
drinkability
but
nothing
to
make
me
want
to
race
out
and
buy
more
either
overall
its
a
pretty
good
stout
black

personally
dont

beer
can
get
much
better
than

job
by
beamish

my

nitrocan
irish

this

cool

than
the

suspect
dry

with
plenty

keep
it
interesting
milky
smooth
mildly
bitter

squeeky
clean
without

it
lacks
guinness
sour
note

makes
up
for
it
in
roasted
flavors

for
slugging
down
during
activities
such
as
darts
or
pool

sessionable
decent

about
along

it

for
all
those
guiness

out
there
give
the
less
known
irish
stouts
a
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
while
you
are
near
the
guiness
take
a
look
down
in
the
area
you
may
see
one
of
these
beamish
cans
while
you
are
at
it
also
grab
a
guiness

murphys
then
go
home
and
taste
the
difference
ireland
has
about
a
21percent

everything

definetly
worth
it

well
after
half
a
year
and
over
300
deep
into
my
beer
quest
ive
realized
that
irish
stouts
arent
the
greatest
anymore
this
one
is
still
my
favorite
but
the
taste
is
thin
and
lacking
as
is
the
mouthfeel
certainly
a
sessionable
beer

no
longer

taste
is
burnt
toast
caramel
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
little
bitter
at
the
finish
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
this
is
a
good
alternative
to
my
goto
guinness
despite
some
very
distinct
differences
the
two
brews
have
this
beer
looks
great
but
the
taste
isnt
exceptional
a
good
change
of
pace
in
irish
stout
but
nothing
extraordinary
grabbed
a
4
pack
the
other
day
in
anticipation
of
enjoying
them
tonight
during
the
ncaa
tournament
which
happens
to
coincide
with
st
pattys
day
so
winwin
the
best
pour
of
any
irish
stout
i
have
ever
had
comes
out
of
the
draught
can
creamy
and
immediately
begins
to
cascade
down
in
my
pub
glass
a
thick
creamy
head
blankets
the
top
of
my
glass
and
stays
throughout
the
entire
beer
even
after
the
beer
is
gone
the
head
remains
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
intense
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
the
color
is
a
rich
dark
mahogony
strong
aroma
is
present
making
me
aware
of
the
roasted
malts
that
dominate
this
beer
all
of
the
other
irish
stouts
i
have
sampled
had
a
faint
aroma
that
was
hard
to
detect
beamish
lets
you
know
right
away
that
you
are
going
to
enjoy
their
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
this
stout
is
beyond
creamy
with
an
exceptional
finish
the
flavor
is
bursting
with
rich
roasted
malts
undertones
of
coffee
are
present
it
is
now
known
that
beamish
is
on
the
outs
and
this
is
unfortunate
because
in
my
opinion
guinness
is
very
good
murphys
is
better
but
beamish
is
the
cream
of
the
crop
my
only
regret
is
that
i
was
not
able
to
discover
this
beer
sooner
fantastic
dry
stout
im
going
back
to
the
store
to
stock
up
easy
to
drink
nothing
offensive
a
good
intro
to
the
style
not
my
favorite
maybe
ill
have
to
try
a
bottle
or
tap
as
the
nitro
can
character
really
overtakes
everything
look
nose
and
flavor
feel
and
sessionability
very
drinkable
overall
i
give
it
a
slight
edge
over
the
other
popular
dry
stouts
overall
a
delicious
stout
good
balance
of
malt
hops
and
roasted
grains
not
too
overpowering
from
any
angle
all
elements
meld
together
great
to
give
you
a
great
tasting
easy
drinking
stout
d
very
drinkable
because
of
the
smooth
flavor
and
lighter
body
the
beer
pours
from
the
widget
can
with
waves
and
waves
of
tiny
bubbles
floating
up
to
form
the
beautiful
cap
of
creamy
foam
after
things
settle
down
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
chestnut
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
earthy
hops
and
coffee
notes
round
out
the
light
aroma
light
and
almost
silky
on
the
palate
cocoa
powder
is
the
main
flavor
on
the
palate
followed
by
a
bitterness
that
leaves
the
palate
dry
good
and
drinkable
i
think
i
will
have
another
a
good
bit
more
flavor
than
guiness
nitro
but
that
isnt
saying
much
go
for
this
if
you
find
it
holds
cardboard
sign
says
needs
change
for
beamish
god
bless
you
d
i
could
drink
so
many
of
these
much
better
than
guinness
in
my
opinion
dodges
bullets
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
enjoyedit
very
sessionable
on
the
palate
the
roasty
flavors
come
through
nicely
with
a
modest
amount
of
hops
for
balance
medium
to
light
bodied
very
very
drinkable
for
a
dry
irish
stout
nitro
can
pours
black
with
brown
edges
and
eggnog
colored

smell
sweet
grain
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
smoky
burnt
character
yeast
taste
roasty
bitterness
coffee
and
cream
mouthfeel
smooth
would
be
the
operative
word
nice
dry
stout
slightly
better
than
the
other
big
name
nitro
stouts
d
compares
very
well
to
guinness
and
the
other
irish
stouts
of
its
kind
so
in
other
words
its
good
nothing
blows
me
away
with
it
though
very
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
should
have
invested
in
the
4
pack
instead
of
the
single
pours
beautifully
reminds
me
of
being
in
ireland
black
on
the
bottom
and
beautifully
tan
and
creamy
looking
on
the
top
nice
minor
roasted
thing
going
on
with
a
nice
malty
body
its
smooth
with
just
a
touch
of
a
bitter
edge
to
it
its
nice
smooth
feel
on
all
levels
and
its
extremely
drinkable
pretty
tasty
irish
dry
stout
that
definitely
should
be
tried
if
you
have
the
chance
we
totally
received
a
case
of
this
by
mistake
at
the
abc
where
i
work
so
i
took
it
as
a
sign
from
the
beer
gods
to
go
ahead
and
give
this
one
a
try
served
it
slighty
chilled
in
my
samuel
smith
pub
glass
poured
a
powerful
midnight
black
color
with
a
rapid
expanding
cocoa
brown
head
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
with
some
cocoa
powder
and
brewed

was
smooth
as
silk
thank
you
nitrogen
bubbles
with
heavy
bakers
chocolate
in
the
front
and
light
sweet
roasted
malts
on
the
dry
finish
i
could
see
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
on
st

hits
first
with
the
roast

then
some
dried

some

is
medium
to
thin
crisp
carbonation
great
irish
stout
very
sessionable
light
to
medium
body
exceedingly
smooth
fairly
wellbalanced
palate
overall
a
very
simple
and
modest
stout
thats
easy
to
drink
and
quite
pleasing
very
similar
to
guiness
etc
but
i
think
it
has
a
nicer
body
and
slightly
deeper
flavor
a
good
beer
alternative
i
keep
comparing
to
guinness
and
although
not
as
good
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
kinda
like
a
guinness
light
or
something
recommend
at
least
trying
beamish
is
a
good
irish
stout
and
it
gets
a
slight
nod
over
murphys
just
because
its
a
bit
more
rare
ive
found
it
runs
about
neck
and
neck
with
guinness
for
the
style
so
its
a
good
bet
and
probably
a
better
value
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
but
with
some
ruby
edges
in
the
light
a
lovely
1
inch
of
creamy
tan
head
forms
after
a
nice
fall
great
retention
and
nice
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
but
some
dark
fruit
notes
come
out
as
it
warms
tastes
of
roasted
malt
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
dry
hop
finish
smooth
and
creamy
low
in
carbonation
semi
thick
with
a
good
roasted
sweetness
and
a
nice
dry
finish
lots
of
flavor
and
low
in
alcohol
great
irish
dry
stout
from
a
can
much
easier
to
drink
than
nitro
versions
of
guiness
or
murphys
but
there
is
still
an
overall
lack
of
flavor
maybe
an
intro
beer
for
someone
new
to
the
style
otherwise
its
just
for
those
with
love
of
the
nitrocan
nitrocans
work
for
near
flavorless
pale
beers
i
e
boddingtons
but
for
something
like
a
stout
which
should
be
full
of
flavor
its
draught
experience
at
the
expense
of
flavor
pours
out
a
dark
ruby
almost
black
body
with
a
moderate
sized
creamy
nitro
head
leaves
some
nice
lacing
nose
is
kind
of
light
from
the
nitro
but
there
is
a
nice
presence
of
roast
dried
fruit
and
a
little
hint
of
smoke
taste
really
blows
guinness
and
murphys
out
of
the
water
i
get
chocolate
dried
fruit
smoke
ash
coffee
and
wet
sweet
tobacco
for
what
it
is
it
does
its
job
well
mouthfeel
isnt
as
creamy
as
the
other
nitro
stouts
which
imo
is
a
plus
as
it
doesnt
have
such
an
artificial
feel
there
really
arent
many
bubbles
on
the
tongue
great
drinkability
this
has
always
been
my
preference
amongst
the
3
big
nitro
stouts
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
creamy
and
drinkable
irish
dry
but
it
lacks
a
bit
in
body
more
richness
on
the
palate
would
make
this
one
much
better
as
well
after
pouring
from
the
nitro
can
and
settling
into
my
pint
glass
this
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
tan
colored
creamy
head
a
wonderful
site
to
behold
exactly
as
you
would
expect
for
this
style
aroma
is
light
and
toasty
and
inviting
the
taste
is
creamy
with
a
lot
of
coffee
flavor
finishes
a
little
sweeter
then
other
dry
irish
stouts
excellent
beer
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
the
first
hint
of
good
things
is
the
aroma
which
is
not
that
muted
its
mild
but
still
quite
aromatic
with
a
range
of
nice
qualities
chocolate
coffee
burnt
toast
a
hint
of
cherry
more
rich
and
complex
than
usual
the
taste
also
was
unusually
rich
and
strong
with
a
definite
chocolatecoffee
character
backed
up
with
toast
but
not
overly
burnt
smooth
and
tasty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
it
has
a
nice
light
bitterness
in
the
lingering
smooth
chocolate
finish
with
hints
of
coffee
it
is
even
a
bit
oily
and
quite
smooth
tasty
and
very
drinkable
it
shows
that
even
a
nitro
dry
stout
can
be
really
good
pours
pitch
black
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
head
a
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
roasted
malt
flavors
too
a
bit
sweeter
than
other
irish
stouts
very
drinkable
it
seems
that
everybody
has
to
compare
this
beer
to
guinness
and
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
two
i
would
go
beamish
something
about
the
slightly
sweeter
taste
that
gives
it
the
edge
drinkablity
really
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
stimulating
but
the
body
is
light
enough
that
a
person
can
enjoy
multiple
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
from
the
can
with
a
short
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
covering
over
the
beer
really
nice
looking
beer
it
laces
the
glass
very
well
on
the
way
down
as
well
the
smell
is
of
deep
roasted
malts
some
coffee
some
chocolate
some
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
the
taste
is
really
good
very
deep
roasted
malts
are
the
base
for
a
complex
layering
of
chocolate
light
coffee
taste
and
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitter
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
very
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
from
the
nitro
widget
inside
the
can
the
drinkability
is
excellent
this
beer
does
not
have
alot
of
alcohol
but
it
does
have
alot
of
flavor
this
is
my
favorite
irish
dry
stout
yet
out
of
the
big
three
irish
dry
stouts
this
is
my
favorite
unlike
guinness
draft
the
body
stays
strong
until
the
finish
and
the
levels
of
sweet
roasted
malts
seem
perfectly
balanced
mfd
my
only
complaint
is
i
wish
this
stout
was
a
little
more
dense
its
a
little
watery
side
still
all
in
all
beamish
is
at
the
top
of
the
class
when
it
comes
to
dry
irish
stout
i
believe
we
can
session
this
one
lads
a
bit
watery
but
smoothed
out
by
the
nitro
mfd
thick
and
creamy
stout
that
coats
the
mouth
in
a
slightly
sticky
smokey
film
not
as
dry
as
the
other
irish
stouts
very
happy
with
this
stout
actually
tried
it
because
fellow
ba
member
nasty15108
said
it
was
better
than
guinnessblasphemy
he
was
absolutely
right
great
thick
stout
body
with
a
surprising
sweet
smokey
taste
i
highly
recommend
this
to
all
guinness
enthusiasts
as
you
will
not
be
dissappointed
d
good
d
especially
on
st
pats
day
i
enjoyed
a
can
of
this
on
st
patricks
day
and
promptly
followed
up
with
another
hugely
drinkable
and
quite
flavorable
especially
comparted
to
that
other
irish
stout
out
there
this
was
a
solid
pickup
decent
beer
nice
to
see
on
tap
here
in
baltimore
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
irish
stout
style
out
of
the
3
big
irish
dry
stouts
this
is
the
best
in
my
opinion
still
very
similar
to
the
other
2
but
his
one
offers
much
more
taste
some
outliers
belie
how
much
most
of
our
12
tasters
liked
this
beer
7
out
of
12
gave
it
an
overall
of
4
while
only
2
tasters
gave
it
an
overall
of
less
than
3
its
dry
and
lightbodied
letting
it
drink
easier
than
you
might
expect
some
thought
the
roasted
flavor
was
a
tad
strong
still
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
the
smell
a
pleasant
peaty
flavor
youd
expect
from
one
of
the
worlds
most
famous
stouts
a
damn
good
irish
stout
basically
follows
the
lines
of
the
other
two
but
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
three
big
irish
stouts
slainte
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
probably
would
be
great
with
car
bombs
easy
st
patricks
day
beer
or
when
you
are
feeling
irish
and
want
to
be
a
little
different
then
the
guinness
crowd
drinkability
was
impressive
this
was
a
relatively
light
yet
flavorful
beer
a
welcomed
alternative
to
the
other
irish
dry
stout
my
new
goto
dry
stout
for
sure
id
have
stopped
drinking
guinness
a
long
time
ago
if
id
tried
this
earlier
d
i
like
it
ill
be
looking
for
it
more
this
weekend
during
the
st
patricks
day
celebrations
it
doesnt
weigh
down
your
stomach
and
isnt
real
big
on
flavor
or
smell
low
alcohol
makes
it
easy
to
session
one
of
these
every
now
and
then
certainly
wouldnt
hurt
drinkability
is
exceptional
well
isnt
that
what
this
beer
style
is
all
about
i
ended
up
taking
care
of
the
whole
4pack
and
still
wanted
more
oh
well
next
time
taste
and
mouthfeel
roasted
barley
black
coffee
and
woodsmoke
lightbodied
the
finish
is
quite
dry
leaving
a
pleasant
smoky
aftertaste
refreshing
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
pretty
bold
stuff
for
being
a
mere
4
1
abv
this
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
guinness
d
overall
a
great
irish
stout
on
nitro
with
an
incredible
silky
smooth
drinkability
factor
dvery
drinkable
on
taptwo
or
three
and
i
will
have
to
reach
for
somthing
a
bit
lighter
d
classic
stout
delicious
a
beer
that
you
could
really
enjoy
typical
nitro
pour
cascading
bubbles
settling
to
black
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
decent
if
subtle
aroma
taste
is
of
watery
malt
and
wet
paper
i
havent
had
this
in
years
but
i
remember
it
being
better
than
this
not
terrible
but
rather
average
even
for
an
irish
stout
d
this
is
a
great
session
stout
very
mellow
with
a
lot
of
irish
character
not
as
bold
as
more
modern
interpretations
of
the
style
very
refined
on
tap
at
mcgillins
pours
nice
and
slow
the
creamy
goodness
cascading
into
the
glass
pitch
black
with
thick
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
great
velvety
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
creamy
coffee
with
a
finish
of
more
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
excellent
so
very
smooth
drinkability
too
is
excellent
about
the
best
adjective
for
it
this
was
similar
to
others
in
the
style
but
id
consider
it
slightly
better
its
very
mellow
and
blended
and
could
be
used
as
a
great
session
stout
d
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
ill
stick
to
the
local
stouts
but
i
am
tempted
to
buy
more
of
these
smell
is
a
bit
fuller
though
stronger
chocolates
and
roasted
aromas
taste
is
where
i
give
it
the
biggest
edge
definetly
sweeter
than
guinness
but
not
over
done
finishes
with
roasted
flavors
and
manages
to
be
both
crisp
and
creamy

be
having
this
one
again
a
rich
yet
very
different
stout
than
guinness
less
of
a
creamy
head
which
is
fine
by
me
good
flavour
nice
chocolatecoffee
finish
nice
bitters
finish
a
good
balance
between
the
two
wonderful
mouthfeel
very
silky
a
worthy
replacement
to
guinness
body
is
quite
creamy
but
very
thin
its
pretty
drinkable
but
ive
got
so
many
other
better
alternatives
i
wont
revisit
this
one
very
often
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
the
dryness
becomes
a
little
draining
creaminess
is
good
though
i
have
to
make
the
obvious
comparison
and
still
give
the
nod
to
guinness
although
this
would
probably
be
a
good
piece
to
a
black
and
tan
d
this
is
probably
my
favorite
session
beer
easy
drinking
that
can
is
good
in
the
summer
and
winter
and
in
between
wow
my
first
voyage
into
the
irish
stouts
pitch
black
with
a
rich
creamy
tan
head
smells
of
burnt
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
for
as
dark
and
heavy
as
it
looks
its
extremely
drinkable
will
definitely
get
this
one
again
highly
recommended
the
bitterness
is
not
likely
to
be
too
bitter
for
anyone
which
really
means
it
could
do
with
a
little
more
almost
tastefeels
like
a
normal
stout
was
watered
down
no
real
flavor
to
speak
of
d
a
really
easy
drinker
i
could
see
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
if
the
mood
is
right
now
this
is
irelands
top
dog
the
best
of
the
best
black
with
a
thick
sticky
white
head
smells
once
again
like
a
good
pub
should
the
taste
is
for
lack
of
a
better
way
to
say
it
what
irish
stout
is
supposed
to
taste
like
the
mouthfeel
is
also
perfect
and
it
is
chugable
as
stout
gets
without
being
watery
if
you
see
this
beer
and
pass
it
up
you
should
probably
seek
counseling
rivals
murphys
for
the
best
in
ireland
rains
up
and
pours
looking
like
an
oreo
missing
the
top
cookie
smooth
thick
creamy
malty
and
a
little
more
grainy
than
its
fellow
irish
brews
honestly
if
you
put
beamish
and
murphys
in
a
glass
most
people
would
not
be
able
to
taste
the
difference
but
wait
for
that
little
grainy
mouth
feel
in
the
aftertaste
and
youll
catch
it
great
beer
notes
to
my
knowledge
kegs
arent
available
on
the
west
coast
or
at
least
thats
what
i
heard
at
the
pub
that
i
go
to
that
no
longer
carries
it
i
can
only
find
the
cans
anymore
at
bevmo
which
are
fine
but
i
love
this
stuff
on
draft
does
anyone
know
anything
about
this
and
if
its
true
how
to
obtain
a
keg
d
a
good
brew
from
cork
though
i
do
think
the
nitropackaging
and
pasteurization
take
something
away
from
it
but
a
good
session
beer
with
its
extremely
low
alcohol
content
and
mild
flavour
poured
from
a
nitro
can
to
a
pint
glass
very
dark
with
a
much
lighter
head
not
as
foamy
as
a
guiness
faint
roasted
malt
smell
mouthfeel
light
and
creamy
and
the
taste
roasted
malts
bit
of
coffee
burnt
toast
nice
bitterness
at
the
end
i
had
a
few
on
a
gig
a
wonderful
session
brew
when
getting
a
buzz
is
out
of
the
question
lighter
and
sweeter
than
guinness
or
murphys
i
probably
like
it
better
than
murphys
and
not
as
much
as
guinness
but
any
of
the
three
are
great
beers
and
it
is
entirely
a
matter
of
what
mood
i
am
in
pours
out
a
great
pitch
color
you
can
barely
see
a
pinpoint
of
light
shining
through
it
when
you
hold
it
up
to
a
fixture
excellent
head
cascades
great
at
first
with
excellent
lacing
a
nice
aroma
nothing
too
great
just
a
nice
light
stout
scent
nice
taste
fairly
deep
good
burnt
grains
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
goes
down
excellent
very
smooth
a
nice
alternative
to
guinness
if
they
have
it
at
a
barrestaurant
friendlier
than
guinness
but
without
the
character
very
accessible
easy
drinking
but
still
creamy
rich
bittersweet
clean
nice
head
this
one
served
with
beer
gas
and
a
sparkler
faucet
good
finish
a
session
irish
stout
i
guess
wish
this
was
brewed
in
ireland
its
a
decent
gimmick
that
works
well
if
you
like
your
stouts
much
like
i
do
d
while
beamish
is
not
readily
available
where
i
live
given
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
again
i
would
choose
this
over
guinness
for
the
smell
and
the
taste
d
a
very
appealing
low
alcohol
ale
the
flavor
is
big
for
the
strength
a
top
notch
irish
stout
not
the
best
i
ever
had
but
very
good
and
very
drinkable
this
will
always
be
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
never
disappoints
me
no
matter
where
i
get
it
what
could
be
better
in
95
degree
heat
than
an
irish
stout
on
draft
at
branagans
in
fullerton
it
has
that
trademark
nitrostout
look
to
it
not
as
rich
in
coffee
flavor
as
i
remembered
it
from
the
can
but
more
addictive
on
draft
for
some
reason
just
like
murphys
on
draft
if
i
had
a
bigger
wallet
i
could
line
the
bar
with
empty
pint
glasses
saw
this
on
the
shelf
at
binnys
and
i
had
to
pick
it
up
i
love
stouts
so
im
always
trying
more
beamish
appearance
was
wonderful
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
with
good
creamy
head
and
good
lacing
smell
seemed
light
for
a
stout
but
chocolate
smell
is
there
the
taste
starts
out
sweet
and
finished
dry
and
roasted
this
made
for
excellent
balance
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
but
light
for
a
stout
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
good
for
this
beer
could
easily
session
this
beer
overall
beamish
is
going
to
be
my
first
choice
for
irish
stout
now
that
the
weather
is
getting
cooler
this
will
probably
be
a
regular
in
my
stash
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
that
filling
for
the
style
very
mild
kick
i
suppose
if
youre
a
guinness
fan
youd
probably
like
this
beer
but
im
not
so
i
dont
even
though
i
dont
particularly
like
the
style
for
the
most
part
ive
definitely
had
better
irish
dry
stouts
at
4
00abv
it
makes
a
case
for
a
good
session
beer
you
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
mixed
company
and
still
be
able
to
hold
a
normal
conversation
its
definitely
a
bit
more
watered
down
that
most
stouts
but
thats
part
of
its
appeal
its
got
good
taste
but
doesnt
fill
you
up
can
we
say
dry
stout
light
overall
a
decent
enough
stout
but
sadly
served
way
too
cold
i
would
choose
this
over
guinness
on
tap
if
i
could
worth
a
try
hasnt
got
the
body
of
a
guinness
nor
the
dryness
of
a
murphys
but
there
is
personality
in
this
brew
nonetheless
overall
great
brew
glad
to
have
back
in
the
states
drinkability
a
very
nice
irish
stout
that
isnt
as
dry
as
some
of
the
others
ive
had
it
many
times
but
i
never
found
myself
in
a
position
to
review
it
then
i
had
a
few
left
over
from
having
some
lads
over
for
a
phillies
game
they
won
pretty
much
a
coin
flip
these
days
and
i
thought
nows
the
time
ive
always
enjoyed
it
but
looking
closely
made
me
realize
its
pretty
close
to
top
of
the
heap
among
the
true
irish
dry
stouts
available
its
a
bit
more
filling
than
some
of
its
brethren
but
with
such
a
practical
abv
it
drinks
like
a
wellbaked
if
voluminous
pleasure
theres
a
case
to
be
made
for
keeping
a
sixer
of
this
in
the
dbf
at
all
times
if
only
it
didnt
seem
to
fly
so
below
the
radar
ive
been
drinking
beamish
for
quite
some
time
and
i
prefer
it
to
most
other
irish
stouts
its
not
quite
as
dry
and
has
a
nice
creamy
feel
to
it
especially
on
that
first
sip
its
smooth
all
the
way
to
the
finish
if
you
can
find
this
on
tap
even
better
but
the
nitrocan
works
very
well
this
brew
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
half
and
inch
in
height
creamy
white
and
does
not
recedes
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
cream
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
a
lot
lighter
than
the
aroma
the
are
still
some
nice
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
but
they
are
all
rather
faint
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
adequately
low
carbonation
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
more
character
than
guinness
but
is
still
only
average
d
excellent
irish
dry
stout
sessionable
must
try
for
this
style
though
i
think
some
american
brewers
are
doing
this
style
better

sweet

stay
on
the
back

without
the
carbonation
to
wash
them
off
fairly
drinkable
not
bad
fairly
similar
to
albeit
a
bit
better
than
my
old
favorite
guinness
draught
would
be
much
better
if
carbonated
or
on
cask
imho
still
a
relatively
decent
dry
stout
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
still
quite
dry
but
it
is
one
of
the
sweetest
of
the
irish
dry
stout
nitro
cans
ive
had
i
like
how
the
nitro
charge
doesnt
completely
cover
up
the
malt
flavor
great
taste
for
a
nitro
stout
but
it
still
seems
no
more
robust
than
an
american
brown
ale
just
much
creamier
and
maybe
a
bit
more
smoky
my
beer
of
choice
for
making
black
tans
or
irish
car
bombs
on
the
rare
occasion
that
i
crave
one
or
the
other
very
easy
to

quantities

slightly

mouthfeel
is
smooth

typical
of
a

but
features
a
little
more
carbonation
which
to
me
is
a
good
thing
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
a
very
good
stout
and
in
my
opinion
much
better
than
murphys
or
guinness
only
thing
lacking
is
a
virtually
nonexistant
aroma
not
unpleasant
just
not
much
there
still
a
good
beer
beamish
looks
like
a
standard
nitro
stout
in
the
glass
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
not
quite
opaque
with
a
thick
off
white
head
the
smell
is
of
roast
malt
and
other
burntblack
malts
along
with
black
coffee
the
taste
great
notes
of
dark
malts
roasted
malts
coffee
chocolate
and
wood
and
a
little
chalky
too
some
bitterness
from
malts
but
no
perceivable
hop
bitterness
all
in
all
more
pronounced
flavor
than
guinness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
very
nice
and
creamy
very
full
slightly
sweet
finish
all
together
pleasing
drinkability
too
is
good
low
in
alcohol
plus
a
bit
more
flavor
than
guinness
makes
it
more
fun
to
drink
not
bad
at
all
you
can
tell
this
beer
isnt
guinness
but
its
such
a
subtle
difference
maybe
a
bit
sweeter
but
i
dont
know
if
im
just
imagining
things
still
a
very
nice
irish
stout
that
id
have
no
problem
having
again
drinkability
when
you
drink
a
beamish
you
can
help
but
compare
it
to
a
guinness
you
shouldnt
but
you
do
for
good
reason
both
in
my
opinion
are
fine
examples
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
i
would
drink
a
beamish
over
a
guinness
if
given
the
choice
goes
down
very
smooth
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
find
the
finish
of
the
beamish
to
be
what
wins
me
over
finish
is
slightly
dry
14
9
oz

the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
almost
an
inch
creamy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
is
very
good
it
smells
like
roasted

grain
smoke
and
a
bit
of
coffee
tastes
like
roasted
maltgrain
coffee
and
some
darkbitter
chocolate
the
beer
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
very
strong
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
almost
a
bit
watery
too
lightwatery
than
i
care
for
in
this
style
of
beer
its
also
creamy
smooth
and
dry
drinkability
is
good
its
very
sessionable
id
definitely
buy
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
beamish
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
d
very
very
high
in
my
opinion
this
is
my
all
time
favorite
dry
stout
from
ireland
better
than
guinness
to
me
and
highly
sessionable
as
a
former
guinness
lover
who
has
found
guinness
to
be
different
than
what
it
used
to
be
seeing
this
on
tap
was
quite
the
find
i
found
it
to
be
much
like
what
i
remembered
guinness
to
be
if
you
like
guinness
youll
love
beamish
d
absolutely
drinkable
easy
and
smooth
wonderful
drybitter
finish
fairly
clean
yet
eminently
flavorful
i
certainly
would
get
this
again
theres
nothing
terribly
complicated
about
it
its
just
agreeable
and
sessionably
light
recommended
d
is
what
an
irish
dry
stout
should
be
smooth
and
creamy
not
a
huge
flavor
but
some
nice
taste
low
in
alcohol
makes
it
a
great
session
dry
stout
drinkability
definite
repeater
d
excellent
my
favorite
accompaniment
to
a
nice
juicy
hamburger
and
also
a
nearly
perfect
session
brew
although
it
seems
more
popular
on
beeradvocate
than
guinness
i
think
beamish
just
falls
a
little
bit
short
the
deep
blackruby
read
appearance
is
near
as
impressive
as
a
guinness
and
the
taste
is
as
smooth
but
i
find
myself
considering
guinness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
little
bit
better
beamish
has
the
similiar
creamy
inchthick
head
leaves
a
very
fair
amount
of
lacing
and
the
roasted
barley
taste
is
beautiful
if
guinness
is
a
10
which
i
consider
it
to
be
beamish
is
a
9
8
the
color
is
black
but
when
put
to
a
light
is
more
of
a
very
dark
ruby
red
i
dont
think
there
is
much
room
for
it
to
improve
on
the
look
of
the
brew
as
far
as
a
stout
goes
its
pretty
much
perfect
if
i
was
disappointed
with
anything
its
that
i
didnt
smell
much
maybe
roast
with
a
sweet
scent
that
i
cant
quite
make
outbut
basically
very
plain
smellingthe
taste
was
very
good
coffee
and
cream
but
not
to
bitter
like
some
stouts
get
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
end
very
similar
to
guiness
but
oh
so
much
better
mouthfeel
almost
like
a
milk
stout
i
think
the
feel
of
this
brew
is
perfect
so
so
creamy
makes
me
want
to
keep
on
drinking
them
definitely
my
nice
fav
nitro
beer
when
i
cant
find
a
micro
to
drink
sorry
guinness
found
a
new
grocery
store
favorite
i
wish
i
could
find
this
on
tap
or
growler
somewhere
to
see
what
it
tastes
like
without
the
can
very
nice
irish
stout
im
used
to
the
nitrocans
ruining
the
experience
but
here
it
doesnt
do
as
much
damage
as
usual
will
get
again
for
sure
when
i
want
a
beer
of
this
type
pub
can
at
home
produced
a
pleasurable
pour
as
the
beer
cascades
then
settles
in
layers
the
softest
hint
of
smokey
roast
in
the
nostrils
precludes
a
taste
that
holds
a
medium
soft
creamy
smoothness
a
guiness
with
the
slightest
coffee
flavoring
i
find
it
difficult
to
argue
with
something
as
simple
and
basic
as
milk

abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
d
a
great
stout
that
i
will
move
ahead
of
the
other
big
name
in
dry
irish
stouts
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
d
well
suited
for
a
night
of
authentic
irish
stouts
d
much
more
hearty
than
guinness
more
hops
bitterness
than
i
expected
but
not
unpleasant
at
all
like
i
said
im
not
a
big
fan
of
irish
dry
stout
so
im
not
thrilled
by
this
beer
its
ok
once
a
year
but
not
something
id
drink
a
lot
deep
deep
ruby
red
coloron
the
border
of
black
doesnt
have
quite
the
huge
cascade
pour
of
a
guinness
but
an
admirable
looking
beer
no
real

good
amount

a
hint
of
harshness
to
it
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
this
reminds
me
of
a
weak
cup
of
coffee
creamy
though
rather
thin
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
all
night
very
drinkable
beats
guinness
in
a
bad
way
my
new
favorite
nitro
can
if
i
could
find
it
locally
overall
this
is
the
quintessential
dry
irish
stout
and
in
my
view
it
is
better
than
its
two
more
famous
cousins
the
widget
can
presentation
is
imperfect
i
would
prefer
it
on
tap
or
barring
that
bottle
conditioned
but
this
is
the
only
way
i
have
been
able
to
get
it
in
ohio
from
nitrocan
pours
as
expected
very
dark
brown
with
usual
large
nitrohead
smell
is
mild
some
iron
and
roasted
barley
taste
is
same
very
creamyairy
buttery
diacetyl
on
this
st
pattys
day
i
lined
up
the
three
irish
dry
stouts
they
are
almost
indistinguishable
beamish
a
hair
thinner
than
murphys
a
slight
slight
bit
more
buttery
and
sweeter
than
the
other
two
like
the
other
two
easy
to
drink
and
fun
for
st
pattys
or
at
an
irish
party
but
not
a
whole
lot
going
in
the
the
flavor
department
cool
to
look
at
of
course
metallic
aftertaste
after
a
few
this
one
just
lacks
the
publicity
of
guinness
super
drinkable
a
nice
dry
stout
that
kicks
guiness
in
the
arse
in
my
humble
opinion
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
i
expected
so
much
more
from
the
looks
of
this
one
you
would
think
you
might
need
a
spoon
for
this
beverage
but
its
richness
was
as
thin
as
water
i
will
not
likely
try
this
one
again
overall
this
is
pretty
much
a
tossup
with
guinness
except
for
mouthfeel
tastes
a
little
bit
better
this
is
an
excellent
stout
it
pours
a
deep
dark
chocolatey
brown
that
is
close
to
black
the
smell
is
substantially
more
chocolate
than
the
coffee
qualities
that
many
stouts
exhibit
the
tastes
continues
this
trend
with
a
bit
of
caramel
as
well
extremely
rich
and
creamy
texture
and
feel
and
ive
put
away
many
of
these
in
an
evening
the
beer
held
a
half
finger
light
tan
nitrohead
over
an
almost
opaque
body
with
ruby
highlights
left
great
lacing
the
nose
was
simply
a
sweet
light
roast
scent
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
very
very
dry
with
a
bit
of
roast
bitterness
and
a
prominent
milk
chocolate
flavor
there
was
just
a
tiny
bit
of
acidity
with
a
little
vanilla
the
mouth
was
quite
thin
with
low
carbonation
a
very
easy
but
entertaining
stout
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
an
amazing
cascading
head
that
is
very
creamy
and
stays
even
after
the
beer
is
gone
rich
chocolately
flavors
with
coffee
and
some
caramel
it
doesnt
leave
any
unpleasantness
in
your
throat
like
some
other
irish
stouts
even
when
drank
out
of
a
nitrocan
which
usually
kills
most
aromas
and
some
flavor
it
still
tastes
great
and
has
decent
aromas
a
must
try
for
any
fan
of
guinness
this
stout
had
a
good
appearance
a
nice
aroma
and
a
flavorful
first
sip
i
did
find
it
a
bit
heavy
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
smoothness
i
found
the
typical
coffee
note
with
a
woody
and
caramel
flavor
i
recommend
to
the
guiness
enthusiast
pleasant
enough
better
than
the
most
popular
irish
stout
in
my
opinion
overall
a
very
good
stout
which
i
will
surely
drink
again
i
would
say
above
par
with
any
other
irish
dry
stouts
above
guinness
a
good
deal
of
flavour
with
a
strong
coffee
richness
in
the
taste
and
texture
only
a
small
fraction
of
which
is
captured
in
the
aroma
though
some
coarse
mineral
bitterness
but
an
otherwise
creamy
body
average
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
high
i
like
this
guy
more
than
guinness
for
its
more
chocolately
creamy
taste
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
more
overall
on
my
last
trip
to
dublin
than
i
did
the
other
big
guys
from
that
country
although
my
ratings
for
guinness
might
be
higher
that
is
only
an
objective
analysis
whereas
subjectively
i
enjoy
beamish
more
for
its
intangible
qualities
it
has
a
better
balance
of
roast
and
chocolate
compared
to
just
slightly
bitter
roast
of
guinness
its
always
good
to
have
identifiable
options
da
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
really
easy
to
drink
at

abv
get
my
buzz
on
y
session
what
can
i
say
i
love
this
beer
poured
from
a
nitro
can
into
a
guinness
what
else
pint
glass
pours
the
with
the
typical
nitro
cascading
and
settling
into
a
dark
brownblack
nearly
opaque
beer
with
an
super
nice
and
creamy
tan
head
coffee
hints
in
the
aroma
excellent
mouthfeel
very
creamy
i
think
more
so
than
its
twin
brother
guinness
taste
is
chocolate
coffe
and
roasted
malt
with
only
a
slight
bitterness
again
with
the
bitter
bite
and
sourness
of
its
twin
the
creamy
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
lingers
the
lacing
on
this
beer
is
amazing
what
else
to
say
if
you
like
irish
souts
you
will
not
be
disappointed
just
as
good
as
good
ol
guiness
but
different
is
also
better
drinkability
smooth
not
too
bitter
beer
with
anice
mellow
taste
couple
that
with
a
low
abv
and
i
could
drink
this
stuff
for
a
while
poured
into
a
20
oz
pint
glass
from
a
nitro
can
with
an
inch
to
half
inch
forming
as
the
nitro
settled
a
dark
brown
color
with
touches
of
red
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
scent
of
roasted
barley
chocolate
and
coffee
dominating
the
aroma
the
taste
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
slight
twang
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
mouth
it
feels
lighter
than
one
would
expect
but
it
has
creamy
texture
at
the
end
a
standard
for
irish
stouts
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
very
enjoyable
a
rock
solid
drinker
pours
out
to
a
deep
brownishredblack
color
with
a
rich
head
of
dense
cream
foam
the
beer
trickels
down
like
a
malty
sunset
and
leaves
about
a
12
inch
head
scattered
lace
and
lower
carbonation
aromas
were
light
but
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
dry
grain
were
present
taste
was
medium
light
bodied
and
totally
enjoyable
dark
toasty
malts
give
way
to
a
burnt
charred
wood
note
and
minimal
hints
of
hops
linger
on
the
palate
nice
mouthfeel
was
fair
kind
of
light
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
a
solid
and
good
level
of
drinkability
added
to
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
easily
sessionable
recommended
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
nice
creaminess
and
a
very
mild
graininess
in
there
overall
a
decent
brew
better
than
murphys
offering
and
not
as
tasty
as
youngs
choc
d
high
very
poundable
a
great
stout
very
drinkable
a
bit
sweeter
than
guinness
but
equally
enjoyable

glad
to
see
this
still
available
purchased
a
4
pack
of
440
ml
cans
for
5
97
just
for
st
pats
roasty
and
burnt
flavor
in
a
nice
balanced
mix
lots
of
roasted
flavor
some
good
malty
deliciousness
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
huge
body
and
nothing
overly
special
but
highly
drinkable
in
my
book
i
tried
beamish
on
st
pattys
day
cuz
its
an
irish
stout
and
it
just
seemed
like
the
thing
to
do
now
im
not
saying
id
never
have
another
but
there
are
numerous
other
stouts
out
there
id
choose
over
this
one
d
this
beer
is
smooth
dry
and
has
a
nice
dark
malt
flavor
i
think
it
would
have
more
depth
and
flavor
if
it
wasnt
in
the
nitro
can
that
kind
of
washed
out
the
flavor
but
really
pumped
up
the
mouthfeel
full
bodied
and
silky
smooth
heavy
mouthfeel
almost
like
a
meal
in
itself
maybe
this
will
be
my
dinner
i
actually
like
this
much
more
than
guinness
seems
more
complex
and
more
flavorful
dry
finish
a
treat
indeed
if
it
is
like
guinness
it
is
very
drinkable
due
to
lower
alcohol
and
low
carbonation
i
would
say
very
drinkable
and
for
a
change
of
pace
i
often
order
this
beer
if
they
have
it
on
tap
as
the
flavor
differs
slightly
from
guinness
with
a
malty
and
coffee
flavor
that
is
more
forward
beamish
and
murphys
are
two
brands
of
irish
stout
that
i
would
pick
over
guiness
any
day
very
enjoyable
brew
i
hope
rumors
of
newcastle
stopping
import
of
this
are
not
true
drinkablity
i
like
it
but
i
have
had
better
its
ok
and
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
would
grab
a
guinness
first
allthough
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
it
would
probably
taste
and
feel
great
of
the
big
three
beamish
is
definitely
my
favorite
dry
irish
stout
it
has
a
good
deal
of
flavor
and
is
nicely
balanced
it
is
not
overly
astringent
or
overly
roasty
if
youve
only
had
the
most
popular
of
dry
stouts
from
ireland
i
recommend
that
you
give
beamish
a
try
next
time
this
beer
looked
great
with
a
nice
thick
head
hard
to
distinguish
the
smell
of
this
beer
in
a
smoky
bar
tasted
alright
but
it
just
didnt
do
a
lot
for
me
it
seemed
kind
of
watery
without
a
lot
of
flavor
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
i
guess
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
its
got
a
widget
how
can
you
not
love
the
widget
i
really
have
a
soft
spot
for
beamish
well
it
was
st
pattys
this
weekend
and
since
the
irish
choices
were
guinnes
harp
and
beamish
of
course
i
went
with
beamish
and
plenty
of
bushmills
whiskey
weve
begun
stockpiling
beamish
in
my
house
anyway
due
to
the
rumor
that
production
is
to
be
discontinued
this
year
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
im
wiling
to
drink
out
of
a
can
some
guy
at
the
bar
looked
at
me
with
disdain
and
ordered
a
bud
light
but
asked
to
make
sure
he
got
it
in
a
bottle
as
he
eyed
my
beamish
can
but
its
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
quaff
the
widget
always
produces
a
huge
head
so
its
maybe
advisable
to
use
caution
when
pouring
i
hope
its
just
a
rumor
and
that
in
truth
we
have
many
more
st
pattys
days
together
with
beamish
as
well
as
many
weekends
and
even
week
nights
in
between
st
pattys
days
da
well
made
stout
very
drinkable
the
head
is
very
impressive
much
thicker
than
other
stouts
ive
seen
not
sure
about
the
sourness
i
smelledthat
was
really
odd
45
more
of
these
is
not
out
of
the
question
drinkability
this
is
a
very
quaffable
beer
a
classic
session
beer
dam
you
newcastle
for
no
longer
exporting
to
usa
musings
definitely
the
sweetest
of
the
three
irish
stouts
in
the
nitro
can
i
can
honestly
say
i
like
the
current
guinness
product
over
this
either
way
ill
take
oharas
but
they
arent
going
to
be
importing
beamish
into
the
country
any
more
anyway
beamish
i
hardly
knew
ye
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
from
the
nitro
but
starts
to
feel
thin
by
the
end
super
duper
drinkability
though
absolutely
awesome
appearance
as
you
would
expect
the
nitro
gives
this
an
amazing
cascading
effect
that
is
an
awwe
inspiring
experience
the
thick
ice
cream
like
coating
left
after
every
pull
is
second
to
none
this
is
where
the
beer
starts
to
fade
im
a
big
fan
of
easy
drinking
stouts
and
no
doubt
this
is
easy
drinking
but
for
me
it
comes
up
short
smell
and
taste
are
similar
in
that
there
isnt
much
of
anything
to
report
a
touch
of
some
charred
bitterness
and
a
watered
grain
extremely
light
on
the
palate
to
the
point
where
it
seems
the
beer
is
limp
and
lifeless
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
closer
to
its
home
light
bodied
with
the
same
creamy
by
the
way
i
like
that
nice
creamy
top
nitrobased
effect
as
a
guinness
draught
but
seems
to
have
less
coffee
taste
than
the
guiness
the
deep
black
appeareance
looks
great
taste
has
light
bitterness
considering
irish
stout
beers
id
say
its
not
that
great
but
worth
a
try
well
im
sorry
to
say
it
but
if
beamish
does
disappear
from
distribution
here
i
wont
miss
it
you
can
do
far
better
for
the
price
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
between
hop
malt
and
roast
a
well
made
example
of
irish
stout
maybe
not
everyones
standard
and
not
the
biggest
seller
but
its
one
worth
having
so
this
was
a
pleasant
stout
but
was
more
trouble
than
it
was
worth
a
plain
nonnitro
stout
seems
like
a
better
bet
hell
for
the
price
anchor
porter
runs
rings
around
this
black
pour
with
a
small
but
persistent
tan
head
from
a
nitro
can
smell
is
a
faint
maltiness
definitely
some
though
small
hop
bite
in
the
finish
tasty
enough
i
prefer
murphys
myself
for
some
reason
i
havent
seen
murphys
stout
around
here
for
a
while
the
irish
red
is
around
though
for
me
this
is
a
good
regular
drinker
16oz
nitro
can
poured
into
my
guinness
smithwick
all
irish
half
and
half
glass
it
is
as
black
as
pitch
nice
cascading
effect
but
it
doesnt
last
as
long
as
a
guinness
a
nice
pillowy
thick
2
finger
head
formed
and
stayed
for
the
whole
beer
smells
of
weak
coffee
the
taste
seems
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
it
leaves
a
tasty
aftertaste
exceptionally
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
very
little
carbonation
almost
tastes
flat
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
offensive
at
all
this
beer
is
much
better
than
guinness
in
the
nitro
canbottle
that
we
get
here
in
the
states
d
very
drinkable
as
far
as
stouts
go
drinkability
yup
very
drinkable
overall
maybe
i
just
dont
like
the
style
but
this
beer
seemed
too
thin
watery
and
devoid
of
character
mouthfeel
is
very
good
as
is
the
drinkability
all
in
all
i
wont
seek
out
this
one
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
away
a
freebie
either
d
excellent
drinkability
for
a
nitrobeer
i
saw
where
this
beer
was
no
longer
going
to
be
available
in
the
us
and
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
a
while
it
will
be
a
shame
when
this
beer
is
gone
cheers

i

better

easy
to
drink
but
has
a
creamy
texture
with
a
dry
finish
and
some
roasted
flavor
holding
on
but
the
carbonation
is
nearly
flat
and
the
body
is
mediumthis
makes
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
conducive
to
session
beer
this
is
good
tasting
stuff
not
complicated
or
fancy
but
still
a
breath
of
fresh
air
after
all
those
guinnesses
this
beer
came
a
dark
black
with
slight
purple
highlights
and
a
thin
creamy
tan
head
that
left
mild
lace
smells
of
liquorish
chocolate
and
cherries
tasted
of
smooth
sweet
red
grapes
and
chocolate
malt
with
a
touch
of
sourness
what
caught
my
attention
most
was
a
thin
sweetness
that
permeated
the
entirety
of
the
flavor
and
the
surprisingly
clean
finish
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
and
flat
due
to
the
nitrogen
with
a
nice
and
easy
flavor
a
clean
finish
and
a
slick
body
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
starts
extra
smooth
with
a
soft
creamy
taste
right
from
the
start
this
beer
is
very
thick
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
settles
fullbodied
but
thinlyflavored
what
you
can
taste
is
mostly
a
roasted
coffee
and
caramel
mix
with
a
little
of
the
oaky
hint
you
get
from
some
heavier
wines
finish
is
surprisingly
light
with
a
hoppy
bitter
blend
that
forms
the
lasting
portion
of
this
beers
aftertaste
my
suggestion
for
a
good
compliment
to
this
beer
breath
mints
especially
if
youre
on
a
date
one
good
thing
about
stouts
is

content
i
can
enjoy
a
few
more
in
spite
of
the
its
one
dimensional
taste
every
once
in
a
while
ill
get
a
hankerin
for
one
of
these
and
ill
grab
one
not
a
bad
irish
dry
stout
this
is
a
suprisingly
light
bodied
beer
depite
the
velvety
mouthfeel
i
feel
it
might
almost
be
fair
to
call
this
guiness
light
a
bit
bitter
but
not
bad
at
all
i
also
tasted
both
black
coffee
and
maybe
some
toffee
the
beer
itself
wa
pretty
thick
and
rich
like
expensive
dark
chocolate
it
was
a
little
heavy
but
it
is
drinkable
i
probably
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
but
they
beat

mo
this

a
full
bodied
brew
with
a

due
to
the

induced
can
this
is
a
very
well
rounded
dry
stout
that
can
compete
with
the
best
of
them
i
think
it
would
be
great
with
a
meal
stew
perhaps
but
does
really
well
on
its

i
would
most
definitely
go

really

not
great

on

with
great

of

a

of

the
finish
slight
vanilla
on
the
exhale
smooth
mouthfeel
lightly
carbonated
and
in
my
opinion
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
stout
could
pair
with
a
variety
foods
whether
it
be
braised
or
grilled
red
meat
to
vanilla
ice
cream
this
incredibly
drinkable
beer
should
not
leave
you
disappointed
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
if
i
had
it
here
in
the
u
s
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
often
chocolaty
with
rich
roasted
flavours
deep
rich
creamy
velvety
smooth
very
nicely
balanced
quite
dark
and
rather
good
i
dig
it
i
guess
everythings
worth
trying
once
but
for
this
beer
only
once
is
fine
cobblestone
poured
with
a
beautiful
guinnesslike
cascade
and
was
an
opaque
black
colour
with
about
1
of
creamy
looking
beige
coloured
head
when
everything
settled
down
the
head
eventually
faded
to
about
a
collar
of
foam
which
remained
all
through
the
sampling
for
such
a
longlived
head
though
it
left
surprisingly
little
lacing
down
the
glass
overall
though
a
very
good
looking
beer
its
aroma
was
fairly
subduednot
surprising
given
the
everpresent
head
but
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
were
noticeable
cobblestones
taste
was
fabulousa
milk
chocolate
sweetness
from
the
head
followed
by
dark
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
coffee
with
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
all
but
the
initial
milk
chocolate
sweetness
lingered
pleasantly
as
an
aftertaste
for
me
though
despite
the
wonderful
flavours
its
the
mouth
feel
where
cobblestone
falls
short
the
initial
creaminess
from
the
head
stands
out
as
a
stark
contrast
to
the
thin
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
itself
maybe
mill
street
was
trying
to
produce
a
sessionable
stout
when
they
created
this
beer
but
to
me
it
just
comes
off
as
stout
light
if
not
for
the
somewhat
watery
mouth
feel
cobblestone
could
easily
have
entered
buckys
canadian
top
10
list
and
become
one
of
his
go
to
beers
cobblestone
had
a
very
soft
carbonation
in
keeping
with
what
you
would
expect
from
a
stout
cobblestone
sells
for
2
90
per
440
ml
can
at
the
time
of
writing
overall
a
balanced
dry
session
stout
hits
most
of
the
marks
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
too
mild
and
watery
for
my
tastes
smell
is
quite
good
but
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
more
i
yearned
for
more
roastiness
and
assertive
profile
it
is
balanced
and
drinkable
but
i
think
it
could
be
a
little
more
assertive
think
its
a
bit
too
friendly
even
for
the
irish
style
its
going
for
overall
really
nothing
special
about
this
one
fine
but
not
that
enjoyable
i
didnt
finish
the
pint
prost
lampertland
overall
i
have
to
say
that
even
though
dark
lessbitter
beers
like
this
are
my
preference
i
find
this
lacking
tang
or
bitterness
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
given
other
options
available
to
me
but
if
this
were
the
only
thing
on
a
restaurant
menu
besides
bitter
alternatives
pale
ales
etc
id
order
it
this
is
really
good
stuff
an
outstanding
dry
stout
with
a
good
combination
of
complexity
and
drinkability
lame
mill
street
cobblestone
stout
is
a
perfect
example
of
an
ids
very
similar
to
guiness
draught
but
a
lot
more
complexity
in
its
taste
that
really
shines
through
with
vanilla
cream
and
slight
milk
chocolate
that
is
much
more
present
than
your
typical
commercial
idss
overall
this
has
been
billed
as
the
stout
less
traveled
and
is
trying
to
take
market
share
from
guinness
in
ontario
i
admit
that
if
both
options
were
at
the
pub
id
start
with
a
guinness
for
oldtimes
sake
then
switch
to
this
one
for
the
rest
of
the
night
really
good
nose
solid
flavors
and
a
topnotch
feel
in
the

can
the
look
isnt
quite
what
a

stout
could
be
but
thats
a

complaint
will

not

good
stout
for
beginners
trying
something
besides
guinness
same
style
as
the
latter
and
similarly

and
drinkable

less

very

this
in

one
of
my
faves
here
overall
quite
a
brew
prefer
others
in
the
style
but
not
at
all
a
bad
alternative
o
overall
a
decent
irish
dry
stout
but
honestly
i
would
just
prefer
a
guinness
this
is
almost
like
a
guinness
light
it
looks
like
it
but
the
body
is
too
thin
it
smells
like
it
but
the
taste
is
weaker
next
time
would
probably
just
go
for
a
guinness
or
go
for
one
of
their
other
beers
poured
from
a
nitrocan
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
jet
black
coloring
and
light
bodied
with
a
dense
foamy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
into
a
filmy
clingy
coating
nose
of
chocolate
smoke
and
coffee
with
hints
of
peat
very
dry
nose
flavors
are
lighter
than
the
nose
with
caramel
and
mocha
blending
on
a
roasted
backbone
hints
of
smoke
blend
with
creamy
highlights
balanced
but
slightly
sweet
light
dry
body
with
creamy
sweet
aftertaste
dry
clean
finish
with
a
subtle
sweet
and
coffee
linger
easy
to
drink
and
damn
tasty
o
most
nitrocan
beers
ive
had
were
flat
watery
and
low
flavoured
but
this
one
is
actually
pretty
good
entry
level
for
the
style
and
a
little
ambivalent
in
its
own
right
while
the
flavour
is
rather
mild
if
not
completely
nondescript
for
the
most
part
it
is
also
completely
inoffensive
as
there
are
no
off
flavours
to
complain
about
eitherthis
is
an
incredibly
clean
tasting
stout
will
make
a
good
intro
into
stouts
for
the
macro
crowd
worried
about
a
meal
in
a
glass
or
a
thick
chewy
dark
beer
as
this
is
neither
oa
very
drinkable
if
slightly
underwhelming
dry
stout
final
thoughts
this
is
a
mill
st
brew
that
i
looked
forward
to
for
the
longest
time
i
tried
it
on
tap
once
before
this
and
was
shocked
at
what
it
was
i
thought
maybe
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
tap
but
no
the
nitro
can
has
not
fared
even
remotely
better
im
not
quite
sure
why
this
beer
is
so
well
spoken
of
o
this
is
rock
solid
english
stout
given
the
on
tap
choice
of
this
or
guinness
im
probably
taking
a
cobblestone
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
drinkable
stout
impressions
i
got
this
beer
because
ive
been
on
a
bit
of
a
pale
fizzy
lager
kick
and
ive
been
really
wanting
a
good
stout
that
isnt
guinness
i
have
to
say
this
is
certainly
better
than
guinnes
with
a
bit
more
body
but
still
light
on
the
alcohol
and
i
have
completely
enjoyed
this
pint
if
youre
on
the
lookout
for
a
nice
nonheavy
nononsense
sessionable
stout
this
should
be
it
this
is
a
great
sessionable
stout
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
a
nitrocan
id
pound
these
during
football
games
in
a
heartbeat
cool
a
nitro
stout
at
just
above
4
abv
in
a
can
from
mill
street
pours
jet
black
with
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
the
nose
is
roasty
and
slightly
nutty
and
the
flavours
are
quite
big
on
the
initial
sip
but
fade
on
the
finish
better
than
regular
guinness
though
as
i
like
the
bite
in
the
midbody
which
the
irish
stout
lacks
would
buy
this
if
they
releases
it
as
single
tallboys
in
the
stores
will
probably
make
a
regular
appearance
in
the
fridge
though
its
nothing
spectacular
just
a
decent
canned
stout
overall
an
easy
drinking
and
flavourful
english
stout
by
mill
street
stays
true
to
its
heritage
with
the
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
coffee
flavours
i
can
see
this
as
a
pub
favourite
this
is
my
new
go
to
beer
i
have
lost
track
how
many
ive
bought
since
it
hit
shelves
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
can
poured
a
black
color
stout
with
a
huge
creamy
head
with
great
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
faint
black
chocolate
is
a
bit
too
light
for
my
taste
and
probably
diminished
by
the
amount
of
nitro
used
in
this
can
taste
is
also
a
bit
bland
with
some
light
notes
of
chocolate
and
some
light
dry
roasted
notes
body
is
a
bit
light
with
great
carbonation
the
nitro
makes
for
a
nice
creamy
taste
but
kills
also
lots
of
the
flavour
which
isnt
the
best
of
things
in
this
particular
case
o
this
is
a
safe
stout
thin
low
carbonation
low
ibu
low
roastiness
low
chocolate
low
dryness
more
of
an
introductory
stout
then
something
id
expect
of
a
craft
brew
overall
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
flavor
profile
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
with
nitro
and
its
good
overall
overall
a
great
appearance
and
most
nitrocans
have
and
a
very
drinkable
taste
nothing
too
potent
just
a
nice
mix
of
subtle
flavours
just
a
slighty
above
average
stout
in
my
books
first
massproduced
nitro
can
from
a
craft
brewer
in
canada
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
a
pubstyle
stout
its
rich
satisfying
warm
and
mellow
the
smoke
and
wood
characteristics
add
a
layer
of
heartiness
without
being
overbearing
i
hope
to
see
the
local
ottawa
favourite
valley
irish
red
get
canned
as
well
another
sampler
another
rereview
this
stuff
tastes
fine
and
while
the
nitro
mouthfeel
is
definitely
an
acquired
preference
it
still
allows
this
brew
to
go
down
more
smoothly
than
even
a
carbonated
soft
drink
my
only
real
complaint
is
the
price
point
which
doesnt
factor
into
the
final
grade
anyway
sorry
but
for
basically
3
a
can
i
wont
have
much
trouble
finding
other
worthwhile
things
to
drink
e
g
wellington
irs
is
the
same
price
a
musttry
for
nitro
beer
fans
but
not
a
worldbeater
d
an
enjoyable
brew
from
mill
street
for
what
it
is
its
alright
but
i
thought
there
was
definitely
some
room
for
improvement
maybe
ill
review
a
bottle
if
i
can
find
one
enjoy
this
on
its
own
or
to
add
body
to
a
blend
with
any
fruit
beer
one
of
my
pub
favourites
that
ive
been
negligent
in
not
reviewing
until
tonight
a
beautiful
looking
stout
with
an
average
taste
poured
black
with
the
expected
guinness
cascading
nitro
body
thick
and
real
creamy
tan
head
with
fantastic
retention
and
some
good
lace
nose
has
some
roasty
and
dark
chocolate
notes
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
continues
the
coffee
and
roast
grain
notes
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
metallic
note
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
appears
slightly
watery
at
times
low
carbonation
but
smooth
in
feel
a
drinkable
stout
if
not
spectacular
in
flavour
profile
a
solid
stout
with
good
flavour
its
nothing
exceptional
but
it
does
the
job
reasonably
well
and
is
enjoyable
enough
od
really
nice
smooth
good
proper
stout
sessionable
to
the
highest
degree
well
crafted
worth
trying
for
sure
and
something
i
didnt
expect
to
see
on
tap
here
in
calgary
a
pleasant
surprise
and
worth
another
pint
or
two
before
it
goes
away
d
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
i
will
definitely
be
taking
every
opportunity
to
order
this
stuff
on
tap
when
im
out
because
it
was
fantastic
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
thick
tan
head
lacing
down
most
of
the
glass
smells
of
mild
coffee
chocolate
sweet
butterscotch
with
some
roasted
malt
very
sweet
flavour
with
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
very
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
stouts
from
ontario
and
i
wish
more
places
in
toronto
would
replace
their
guinness
tap
with
this
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
4
2
abv
is
a
little
light
but
it
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
stout
i
can
think
of
i
find
the
cobblestone
stout
to
be
as
smooth
as
st
ambroise
oatmeal
stout
but
it
isnt
as
complex
or
interesting
extremely
drinkable
though
and
shows
no
faults
at
4
2
this
would
obviously
be
a
great
session
stout
my
second
favorite
mill
street
so
far
behind
their
tankhouse
ale
a
rather
decent
session
stout
with
just
enough
sweetness
not
overwhelming
and
deftly
balanced
such
a
pleasant
upgrade
from
guinness
i
just
dont
know
where
to
start
oh
wait
i
just
finished
d
a
little
too
roasty
to
be
a
super
drinkable
beer
even
though
the
abv
is
perfect
for
sessions
still
i
had
no
problem
downing
a
pint
and
id
consider
having
more
than
one
depending
on
context
nice
balanced
roast
certainly
no
ris
but
a
well
malted
english
stout
thats
easy
to
drink
at
only
4
2
hints
of
cold
coffee
anise
biscuit
grain
husk
thinner
body
but
thats
what
you
would
expect
dry
lightly
hopped
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
would
gladly
drink
multiple
pints
of
this
one
for
what
it
is
its
well
done
d
this
goes
down
like
water
with
the
roasted
maltbarleycoffee
taste
and
creamy
mouthfeel
it
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
guinness
but
the
bread
nut
and
milk
flavours
add
complexity
i
also
enjoy
the
ashy
finish
a
solid
offering
from
mill
street
downtown
toronto
is
a
place
of
relatively
few
well
preserved
historic
sites
but
the
distillery
district
is
certainly
one
of
them
if
anyone
should
find
themselves
in
the
area
then
a
trip
to
the
mill
street
brewpub
is
definitely
advised
i
know
the
tap
list
is
fairly
large
but
if
the
cobblestone
stout
happens
to
be
available
id
give
it
some
consideration
if
youre
a
stout
fan
then
ordering
it
would
be
a
must
creamy
milkshake
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
i
loved
this
beer
this
is
a
solid
entry
in
a
style
that
sometimes
struggles
to
impress
and
ive
marked
it
up
as
it
compares
very
favourably
to
its
peers
rich
mouthfeel
smooth
creamy
without
being
sweet
i
prefer
this
kind
of
malty
stout
much
like
murphys
but
better
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
it
really
puts
mainstream
stouts
like
guiness
and
beamish
to
shame
thick
and
substantial
stuff
d
good
drinkability
enjoyed
at
the
new
brewpub
very
dark
yet
clear
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
dense

the
nitro

thick

through
the
first
half
of
the
pint
roasty
aroma
with
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
it
also
smells
a
bit
acidic
mild
bitterness
with
chocolate
and
roast
some
acidity
towards
the
end
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
quite
good
for
a
session

very

and

served
much
too
cold
had
to
wait
a
while
for
the
beer
to
improve
but
definately
a
drinkable
stout
ontap
at
the
new

a
bit
of
malt
aroma
tad
of
roast
some
sweetness
roast
barley
late
kick
of

in
mild
dose
kind
of
a
mild
guiness
and
no
where
near
the
thickness
or
strength
of
taste
of
the
american
stout
i
am
so
used
to
and
fond
of
watery
worth
a
trip
to
torontos
distillery
district
for
a
glassful
of
this
one
along
with
some
of
their
other
brews
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
really
like
but
i
can
understand
why
boulevard
might
be
discontinuing
it
i
see
it
as
a
better
version
of
guinness
but
i
also
dont
drink
the
style
terribly
often
so
im
not
a
reliable
consumer
and
i
have
a
feeling
most
regular
guinness
drinkers
would
just
assume
stick
with
their
favorite
its
a
tough
spot
for
boulevard
to
be
in
hence
the
discontinuation
ill
miss
dry
stout
but
there
are
so
many
other
boulevard
beers
that
id
be
much
sadder
to
see
disappear
sampled
on
tap
at
the
boulevard
brewery
tasting
room
on

wish
they
still
bottled
this
beer
they
have
gone
to
kegonly
on
this
brew
so
any
recent
bottle
reviews
have
been
aged
send
some
my
way
very
aggressive
settling
faint
nose
of
chocolate
and
coffee
tastes
of
a
quality
but
uncomplicated
dry
stout
lightbodied
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
in
the
vein
of
guinness
but
a
bit
dryer

i
said
wish
it
was
more

the

was
just
missing
was
hoping
for
more
still
very
drinkable
though
o
enjoyable
beer
nitrogen
helps
out
quite
a

would
definitely
order
it
again

definitely
dry

a
bit

is

up

too
i
would
have
had
5
of
these
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
this
beer
has
a
minimal
off
white
short
head
which
leaves
no
lacing
it
is
also
not
quite
as
dark
as
i
would
like
aroma
is
on
the
roasty
side
more
patent
malt
like
than
anything
else
almost
smokey
aroma
nice
flavor
falls
a
bit
flat
but
is
nice
nonetheless
kind
of
light
very
roasty
light
coffee
flavor
kind
of
nice
mouthfeel
is
definitely
too
light
it
is
not
dry
it
just
feels
watery
could
use
more
carbonation
to
bring
out
some
of
the
dryness
overall
this
beer
is
fine
its
ok
and
could
use
a
few
different
things
to
improve
it
but
definitely
a
nice
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
irish
dry
stout
to
have
with
a
meal
its
light
and
versatile
and
tasty
nothing
worldbeating
but
a
solid
option
for
a
classic
style
o
goes
down
easy
nothing
fancy
just
and
enjoyable
stout
good
for
a
few
drink
not
too
shabby
i
like
how
my
parents
live
in
ks
i
get
all
the
boulevard
offerings
probably
wouldnt
have
this
one
again
with
the
smokestack
series
in
small
bottles
dark
truth
just
stomps
on
the
other
stouts
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
offering
i
think
the
nitro
makes
all
the
difference
with
the
creaminess
and
such
im
sure
what
effect
bottling
would
have
m
lighter
but
appropriate
for
a
dry
stout
mouthfeel
way
too
dry
i
understand
thats
the
style
but
this
literally
deprives
your
mouth
of
moisture
to
a
whole
new
extreme
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
an
not
a
fan
of
he
stouts
that
are
flat
and
this
has
enough
bite
to
satisfy

would
not
purchase
again
md
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
not
bad
nothing
noteworthy
just
a
nice
plain
stout
d
very
sessionable
this
is
very
guinnesslike
when
on
draft
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
a
very
drinkable
solid
brew
overall
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
as
far
as
flavor
and
aroma
wouldve
like
the
head
to
stick
around
longer
and
the
mouthfeel
to
be
creamier
however
i
could
drink
this
everyday
great
beer
pours
as
black
as
used
motor
oil
with
a
foamy
brown
head
which
quickly
disappears
aromas
of
black
licorice
semisweet
chocolate
a
little
burnt
sugar
and
dark
malts
very
malty
on
the
palate
with
flavors
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasted
espresso
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
a
nice
dry
stout
not
over
the
top
or
underwhelming
as
most
of
the
style
seems
to
be
just
solid
not
a
terrible
beer
but
its
just
not
that
terribly
exciting
feels
a
little
watery
in
the
mouth
still
very
drinkable
d
not
too
heavy
i
could
drink
these
all
evening
i
would
give
them
an
agressive
pour
to
bleed
off
some
of
the
extra
co2
other
wise
a
good
session
beer
its
great
to
have
a
this
brewery
in
our
area
drinkabilityas
much
as
one
can
buy
at
a
time
i
could
drink
it
all
great
brew
but
not
the
best
hv
overall
this
is
an
amazing
irish
stout
balance
is
great
the
amount
of
roasted
barley
is
just
enough
to
make
this
a
stout
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
oh
so
very
easy
to
drink
just
another
great
offering
from
boulevard
d
with
this
being
a
bit
lighter
it
does
allow
for
easier
consumption
d
nice
how
the
heavy
dry
roasting
was
kept
to
a
minimum
certainly
not
my
favorite
style
of
stout
but
this
was
an
easy
drinker
and
id
revisit
this
in
the
future
this
is
an
easydrinking
dry
stout
from
boulevard
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
love
the
flavor
and
really
think
boulevard
nailed
this
guy
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
of
boulevards
year
round
offerings
pours
very
dark
with
a
creamy
tan
head
which
settled
down
and
left
some
lacing
smell
is
not
not
impressive
but
the
taste
is
very
decent
light
in
the
mouth
with
medium
carbonation
not
too
bitter
with
nice
aftertaste
very
easy
drinking
not
an
outstanding
stout
but
easy
to
drink
a
couple
or
more
at
a
session
this
brew
pours
up
black
with
a
big
bubbly
tan
head
the
nose
is
chocolate
big
malts
grainy
the
taste
is
clean
dark
malts
with
a
very
dry
and
slight
bitter
finish
finish
nice
full
bodied
medium
carbo
a
very
nice
brew
very
unexpected
thank
you
d
very
drinkable
beer
as
long
as
it
is
optimally
cold
if
the
bottle
isnt
quite
cold
enough
stick
it
in
the
freezer
just
a
bit
and
enjoy
boulevard
dry
stout
is
a
typical
irish
dry
stout
im
still
new
to
stout
but
from
my
experience
this
is
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
tasted
one
of
the
things
ive
discovered
with
dry
stouts
is
that
they
leave
you
thirsty
for
more
stout
thats
not
always
a
bad
thing
d
the
body
is
delighfully
smooth
and
rich
earthy
flavors
with
some
bittering
hops
make
this
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
low
on
body
but
higher
than
id
like
in
carbonation
dry
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
good
except
but
the
smoky
dryness
gets
in
the
way
for
me
pours
a
dark
black
color
13
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
chocolate
slight
hops
and
slight
biscuit
fits
the
style
of
an
irish
dry
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malts
slight
hops
and
slight
biscuit
flavors
rereviewed
on
62009
raised
the
taste
score
from
3
5
to
4
damn
good
stout
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
nice
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
malt
presence
but
turns
a
bit
watery
in
the
middle
before
giving
way
to
a
finish
of
earthy
hops
cracked
pepper
and
peat
the
mediumthin
body
is
wellcarbonated
lending
a
bubbly
bite
to
the
experience
finishes
clean
and
crisp
overall
a
forgettable
beer
but
a
wellcrafted
irish
dry
nonetheless
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
but
id
never
turn
away
a
pint
of
it
pours
a
very
inky
black
colored
body
a
little
brown
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
big
foamy
tan
brown
head
lasting
with
decent
lacing
dry
coffee
aroma
some
slight
bittersweet
chocolate
too
roasted
aromas
some
ash
watery
body
ash
taste
roasted
and
coffee
flavors
some
toffee
too
roasted
aftertaste
some
slightly
burnt
coffee
taste
too
pretty
tasty
light
for
a
stout
almost
porterlike
relatively
light
bodied
without
much
carbonation
slick
but
on
the
thin
side
really
quite
smooth
pretty
drinkable
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
flavorwise
but
its
an
easygoing
sessionable
style
so
i
cant
fault
anybody
id
be
more
than
happy
quaff
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
overall
a
big
thanks
go
to
vancer
for
sending
this
beer
my
way
it
is
probably
one
of
the
best
dry
stouts
i
have
ever
had
most
are
thin
and
lacking
flavor
this
one
was
great
i
tried
this
in
the
distant
past
as
part
of
boulevards
variety
pack
and
found
it
to
be
unpleasant
maybe
due
to
a
bad
experience
i
recently
had
with
a
glass
of
guinness
but
more
likely
due
to
my
still
developing
beer
chops
upon
further
review
however
i
found
this
to
be
a
solid
albeit
somewhat
unremarkable
stout
id
certainly
order
this
over
guinness
any
day
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
motor
oilblack
with
an
inch
of
fizzy
tan
head
smell
is
very
toasty
but
not
very
strong
taste
is
light
with
hints
of
dark
malts
cocoa
coffee
and
burnt
chocolate
extremely
light
mouthfeel
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
worth
checking
out
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
this
beer
pours
a
dark
espresso
brown
with
a
big
3
inch
beige
head
that
slowly
melts
into
just
a
center
ring
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
flat
definite
notes
of
dark
malts
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
but
not
a
whole
lot
and
definitely
no
notes
of
dark
fruits
or
coffee
that
is
so
typical
to
the
style
the
flavor
is
also
just
pretty
bland
a
bit
of
roasted
grains
mixed
with
some
coco
powder
thats
really
all
that
comes
to
mind
the
mouthfeel
is
the
worst
attribute
of
the
beer
this
beer
is
dry
probably
the
driest
stout
i
have
ever
had
and
it
completely
lacks
the
creaminess
that
makes
the
style
so
enjoyable
this
is
in
my
opinion
the
worst
of
the
year
round
beers
that
boulevard
does
give
me
a
bully
porter
over
all
its
better
than
what
i
expected
this
brand
keeps
surprising
me
and
is
light
enough
for
a
sixer
to
go
down
easily
will
use
this
one
to
introduce
to
my
beer
drinking
friends
in
this
style
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
stout
this
stout
isnt
too
think
but
it
is
full
in
flavor
medium
body
but
a
little
thin
and
watery
at
any
rate
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
its
no
beamish
but
hey
ill
gladly
have
another
of
these
d
quite
a
drinkable
stout
thanks
linda
for
the
sample
out
of
a
boulevard
variety
pack
poured
a
pitch
black
with
clear
ruby
highlights
and
a
tall
tan
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
lacking
in
strength
and
cardboard
is
preasent
but
theres
still
a
pleasant
milk
chocolate
and
smoke
smell
the
flavor
is
richer
with
espresso
dark
chocolate
and
deep
roasted
barley
the
feel
is
nice
and
roasty
but
just
a
toast
too
astringent
its
a
bit
thicker
than
the
traditional
imported
idss
but
its
worth
a
try
if
you
big
dry
stouts
im
enjoying
it
notes
from
092305
not
the
best
from
boulevard
but
still
good
better
than
some
of
the
nitro
crap
dry
stouts
from
across
the
pond
overall
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
the
finish
is
quick
with
a
tainting
of
sweetness
there
is
an
alkaline
dusty
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
ok
and
i
would
buy
it
again
eventually
im
sure
the
appearance
and
smell
were
ok
nice
black
color
the
head
didnt
hang
around
long
at
all
though
had
a
bit
of
roasted
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
pretty
good
i
thought
a
nice
metallic
ring
and
a
good
roasted
taste
with
a
nice
hint
of
alcohol
at
the
end
i
didnt
like
the
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
it
was
basically
just
a
watery
mouthfeel
which
is
a
quality
i
dont
care
for
in
a
stout
the
drinkability
was
for
sure
there
in
this
one
i
guess
you
could
say
it
had
its
good
and
bad
qualities
greg
a
little
bitter
and
astringent
on
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
a
bit
thin
decent
but
i
much
prefer
their
bully
porter
over
all
the
others
thats
about
it
a
stout
for
the
uneducated
and
curious
extremely
drinkable
and
sessionable
i
could
see
washing
down
some
spicy
smoked
sausage
and
some
pepperjack
cheese
with
this
brew
perfect
for
a
late
fall
windy
cold
november
eve
some
college
hockey
and
an
early
season
fire
in
the
fireplace
is
where
this
evening
is
headed
a
very
drinkable
brew
although
not
much
more
interesting
than
a
glass
of
water
sessionable
yes
interesting
no
this
would
make
for
an
interesting
crossover
beer
or
session
beer
if
there
are
no
other
options
probably
a
good
stout
to
give
to
the
macro
drinker
to
open
their
eyes
without
being
too
challenging
to
their
palates
but
there
is
not
much
here
to
hold
the
interest
of
a
craft
beer
aficionado
d
too
roasty
for
me
but
a
good
beer
d
easy
to
drink
and
have
multiple
at
a
time
this
was
a
good
take
on
a
dry
stout
drinkability
is
fairly
high
good
flavor
and
low
alcohol
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
allowing
only
a
glimmer
of
light
around
the
edgesthe
head
is
a
medium
creama
bit
thin
and
no
sticky
shit
the
nose
is
soft
and
mostly
made
up
of
chocolate
powder
and
roasted
coffee
beans
this
stout
is
a
little
nuttier
than
usualwith
lots
of
coffee
and
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
subtle
caramel
flavors
mix
with
almond
to
create
a
flavored
coffee
affect
that
helps
pull
off
a
just
above
average
flavor
score
the
body
seems
much
too
thinand
could
really
use
some
more
dryness
as
well
maybe
a
good
intro
stout
for
those
without
an
acquired
palatefor
me
a
let
down
from
a
overall
good
brewery
i
would
buy
this
if
this
was
the
only
thing
with
ml
bl
cl
mgd
bud
etc
but
i
am
sure
glad
i
got
this
one
for
free
because
i
would
have
been
upset
buying
a
sixer
decent
but
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
and
not
hard
to
find
d
nothing
very
special
in
the
dry
stout
department
go
for
the
boulevard
bully
porter
or
even
better
the
bobs
munich
lager
from
their
lineup
d
nonoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
a
light
sessionable
abv
means
i
could
have
another
alas
this
is
my
only
bottle
drinkabiliity
this
is
a
very
good
dry
stout
i
would
buy
it
again
overall
this
beer
gets
a
meh
note
the
drinkability
goes
up
5
if
you
have
this
brew
on
march
17th
smooth
delightful
and
very
drinkable
very
nice
drinkability
due
to
being
such
a
smooth
and
subtle
flavor
could
probably
use
a
little
jumpstart
overall
enjoyable
though
d
i
probably
wont
be
picking
this
one
up
again
this
was
one
of
the
easier
to
drink
dry
stouts
that
ive
had
not
too
strong
but
that
will
appeal
to
some
and
not
others
overall
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
this
sampler
well
done
boulevard
and
welcome
to
tn
in
the
nonimperial
stout
catagory
this
one
is
a
winner
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
although
moderate
carbonation
is
a
plus
im
not
hating
this
beer
but
it
does
absolutely
nothing
to
separate
itself
from
the
bigger
brewers
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
has
a
skimpy
off
white
head
that
sticks
for
a
bit
aroma
is
faint
cocoa
and
dried
fruit
im
missing
the
roasted
grains
that
are
typical
in
a
dry
stout
taste
has
some
chocolates
a
bit
of
roast
bitterness
and
some
more
dried
fruit
carbonation
is
ample
mouthfeel
is
creamy
body
could
be
a
little
thicker
for
me
overall
a
decent
brew
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
this
if
it
were
more
available
to
me
could
use
more
roast
flavor
and
aroma
d
i
would
drink
one
of
these
but
not
more
than
one
unless
there
was
no
better
choice
served
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brownblack
forming
a
1
inch
mocha
head
leaving
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
for
this
beer
was
very
light
actually
having
to
search
for
it
what
was
detectable
was
a
light
hint
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
follows
closely
with
the
aroma
being
a
little
on
the
weak
side
the
taste
was
also
dominated
by
a
light
roasted
malt
flavor
with
very
little
coffeechocolate
flavor
as
expected
this
being
in
the
dry
irish
stout
style
i
expect
it
to
be
lighter
in
flavor
but
not
quite
this
light
clean
smooth
mouthfeel
and
finish
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
i
actually
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
was
just
let
down
a
bit
by
expecting
one
thing
and
then
getting
another
that
aside
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
d
good
good
and
more
good
not
a
demanding
beer
but
it
tastes
good
and
is
a
solidly
sessionable
beer
tasted
on
41108
529
had
this
on
tap
at
a
steakhouse
in
kc
better
than
the
bottle
and
a
nice
substitute
for
guinness
pours
fairly
dark
black
with
a
small
beige
head
smell
is
faint
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malts
not
too
strong
and
almost
a
cherry
note
taste
is
thin
and
watery
dark
malt
with
a
hint
of
tartness
again
a
bit
of
a
drying
character
but
too
thin
and
unremarkable
to
recommend
not
very
good
d
so
many
nice
things
going
for
this
beer
everything
except
for
the
entry
and
middle
of
the
brew
which
is
kind
of
a
big
deal
maybe
on
draft
real
fresh
it
would
be
better
but
this
just
tasted
like
it
had
fallen
apart
pours
a
very
dark
black
colorpretty
much
pitch
black
has
a
small
brown
head
on
it
but
not
much
and
no
carbonation
really
smell
is
really
good
has
that
guinness
smell
to
it
thats
how
i
can
relate
to
it
like
a
chocolately
hazelnut
aroma
taste
is
pretty
good
has
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
with
a
more
profound
chocolate
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
decent
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
depending
on
the
weather
this
brew
has
a
very
peculiar
everchanging
flavor
profile
one
sip
its
all
malt
the
next
its
sweet
fruit
sometimes
very
bitter
sometimes
sweet
and
creamy
it
is
quite
interesting
but
it
never
arrives
at
something
very
likeable
or
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
never
quite
there
not
the
greatest
stout
ever
made
but
i
would
easily
pick
it
over
a
guinness
i
could
easily
drink
several
pints
and
be
perfectly
happy
with
my
choice
d
decently
drinkable
but
nothing
special
i
cant
knock
it
for
being
dry
it
is
what
it
is
but
i
prefer
other
stout
types
drinks
pretty
good
but
give
me
a
irish
big
three
over
this
any
day
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
better
nitro
just
run
of
the
mill
from
a
sampler
pack
bottle
pours
a
dark
mahogany
body
with
a
small
but
lasting
khaki
head
some
good
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
not
much
of
an
aroma
for
a
stout
some
roasty
notes
of
burnt
coffee
is
about
it
thin
in
the
mouth
overcarbonated
for
style
taste
has
a
roasty
bitterness
like
strong
coffee
and
a
pleasant
nuttiness
very
mundane
overall
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
almost
like
guinness
light
with
all
the
flavor
this
was
all
right
but
not
great
ive
been
happy
with
most
of
boulevards
beers
but
this
one
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
i
dont
dislike
this
beer
but
with
that
said
i
would
choose
the
more
readily
available
big
3
over
this
guinness
beamish
and
murphys
this
stout
pour
a
very
nice
dark
brown
in
the
glass
it
only
lost
points
because
while
the
head
had
a
nice
tan
color
it
was
small
and
had
very
little
lacing
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
good
sweet
chocolate
malt
with
a
sprinkle
of
hops
taste
was
good
sweet
chocolate
very
sweet
i
thought
this
was
a
dry
stout
the
hops
hit
finally
but
dont
linger
mouthfeel
was
ok
could
be
a
little
better
if
a
it
were
a
tad
bit
thinker
overall
drinkability
was
goood
went
down
smooth
didnt
leave
me
to
full
nice
stout
even
if
it
was
a
little
sweet
for
a
dry
stout
boulevard
dry
stout
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
hint
of
amber
up
to
the
light
it
has
a
mellow
malty
smell
that
goes
along
with
a
creamy
dry
malted
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
making
it
quite
enjoyable
a
nice
drink
but
the
dryness
really
kicks
in
at
the
end
making
it
a
bit
tough
to
finish
the
bottom
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
tan
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
malty
with
a
chocolate
kick
it
also
had
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
all
in
all
this
was
a
decent
beer
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
thicker
in
the
mouth
but
in
a
pinch
it
is
better
than
some
beers
i
would
drink
this
agian
if
i
couldnt
find
anything
else
to
enjoy
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
it
had
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
quickly
settled
into
a
tiny
collar
the
aroma
was
soso
with
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
not
very
strong
the
taste
was
also
just
average
had
some
flavor
but
really
needed
more
to
stand
out
its
better
than
a
macro
but
not
by
much
mouthfeel
was
watery
overall
its
an
ok
beer
but
with
so
many
better
beers
out
there
i
dont
see
me
having
this
one
again
only
recommend
if
you
can
steal
from
a
friends
fridge
one
and
done
deep
dark
color
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
nice
sharp
roasted
aroma
good
malty
flavor
nice
roasted
notes
with
a
well
balanced
bitterness
fairly
dry
finish
decent
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
could
see
having
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
bet
its
damn
good
on
draft
too
pours
out
a
dark
chocolatey
brown
with
ruby
highlighted
edges
and
a
fluffy
and
whipped
khaki
head
smell
has
notes
of
chocolate
toffee
and
a
mild
roast
some
fruity
esters
pop
up
as
well
pretty
tame
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
starts
off
with
some
esters
and
a
far
pushedback
chocolate
the
finish
brings
on
the
roast
and
ends
dry
welcome
bitterness
hangs
on
after
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
for
its
dryness
and
easygoing
flavor
profile
this
is
really
drinkable
completely
average
stout
with
nothing
outstanding
at
all
this
beer
isnt
the
best
of
its
style
but
its
local
and
the
price
is
right
so
drink
up
d
very
drinkable
beer
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
large
firm
creamy
and
light
tan
in
color
it
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
cream
and
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
with
a
funky
aftertaste
it
is
almost
astringent
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderately
high
carbonation
overall
this
beer
has
a
nice
appearance
and
aroma
but
the
taste
is
too
much
for
me
to
deal
with
i
will
not
drink
this
one
again
poured
a
dark
black
with
just
hints
of
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
2
finger
tan
head

coffee
chocolate
taste
is

chocolate
roasted

bitter
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium

lots
of
carbonation
one
was
plenty
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
much
better
then
other
beers
of
the
same
style
i
truely
enjoy
this
beer
great
flavors
but
not
too
overpowering
good
full
feel
and
good
dry
stout
finish
d
drinkable
but
personally
one
is
plenty
d
its
drinkable
a
decent
brew
but
if
youre
a
big
stout
fan
youll
probably
want
something
else
instead
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
has
the
same
parents
as
the
bully
porter
i
think
i
like
the
bottle

better
the

with
just
a

bit
of
smoke
in
the
background
not
a
very
strong
nose
but
not

bad
flavor
was
comparable
to
the
smell
the
bitter
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
hits
the
tongue
first
followed
by
the
black
licorice
and
any
smokey
notes
in
the
back
finishes
pretty
dry
as
the
name
implies
a
bit
over
carbonated
in
my
opinion
a
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
that
had
an
almost
chalky
feel
to
it
none
of
the
5
2
percent
alcohol
was
present
pretty
drinkable
a
little
too
sweet
a
little
too
carbonated
its
okay
but
more
sessionable
dry
stouts
out
there
imo
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
but
i
found
it
a
little
too
sweet
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
dark
black
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
smell
is
enjoyable
slightly
roasted
coffee
along
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
hints
of
vanilla
the
initial
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
roasted
malt
flavor
being
dominant
and
a
decently
bitter
finish
not
quite
as
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
carbonation
and
a
dry
really
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
sessionable
stout
the
bottle
i
have
has
a
best
by
date
of
three
months
ago
but
it
still
tastes
good
i
would
however
like
to
try
a
bottle
in
its
prime
overall
impression
not
as
dry
as
i
would
think
of
for
a
dry
stout
in
fact
its
almost
sweet
enough
to
be
a
sweet
stout
i
expected
more
body
too
that
being
said
its
a
well
crafted
highly
sessionable
enjoyable
stout
not
a
classic
dry
stout
example
but
a
fine
ale
enjoyed
one
and
would
have
enjoyed
moving
right
on
to
the
other
but
not
worth
savoring
either
thanks
vancer
for
the
opportunity
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
thin
in
the
body
zesty
carbonation
was
a
bit
too
much
d
there
is
not
much
depth
in
this
beer
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
definitely
taste
like
a
stout
d
good
session
brew
albeit
a
bit
boring
drinkability
fair
i
found
this
beer
to
be
some
what
cloying
after
the
first
bottle
not
my
favorite
from
blvd
overall
just
an
average
stout
pours
a
nice

the

not
a

at
all
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
creamy

mouthfeel
seems
really
artificial
and
confected
not
a
fan
drinkable
but
barely
d
it
definitely
got
better
as
it
warmed
but
not
your
typical
stout
maybe
i
need
more
experience
with
the
style
still
ended
up
being
enjoyable
a
good
session
beer
a
pitch
black
dark
beer
with
medium
off
white
head
like
a
lot
of
other
dark
beers
ive
smelled
kind
of
like
molasses
taste
is
a
crisp
dark
beer
with
a
mild
after
taste
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
a
high
carbonation
in
this
beer
a
little
too
much
dry
feeling
in
my
mouth
as
well
drinkability
is
average
i
might
drink
again
if
someone
gave
me
one
drinkability
is
above
average
with
possibly
only
the
dryness
slowing
it
down
i
also
have
to
say
that
the
flavors
and
aroma
that
pleased
me
initially
toned
down
quite
a
bit
as
i
got
used
to
the
flavor
i
can
see
this
happening
as
this
was
my
first
beer
of
the
night
towards
the
end
i
just
didnt
think
the
flavors
were
that
strong
and
wished
it
was
more
robust
poured
to
a
deep
dark
brown
with
tan
head
that
lingered
for
half
the
glass
and
left
okay
lacing
pleasant
aroma
though
muted
of
chiocolate
nuts
and
toffee
with
taste
following
along
the
same
lines
the
body
was
thin
and
slightly
watery
and
the
4
9
abv
never
did
make
itself
known
not
a
bad
beer
but
ive
definitely
had
better
stouts
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
that
the
mouth
is
very
carbonated
overly
so
masks
the
flavor
some
lightly
roasty
dark
malt
kind
of
limp
and
watery
no
creaminess
or
driness
in
this
dry
stout
lackluster
overall
pours
a
four
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
leaving
a
little
lace
midnight
black

light

nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
so
far
only
the
faintest
of
sourish
roasted
malt
aromas
are
detectable
overall
a
very
meager
nose
the
taste
is
more
or
less
a
reflection
of
the
bouquet
such
as
it
is
with
very
modest
roasted
grain
flavors
mingling
with
a
sour
earthy

character
somewhat
funky
nitrogen
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
enough
but
not
quite
creamy
light
body
definitely
to
style
in
all
this
will
hardly
knock
any
socks
off
but
i
suppose
its
a
step
up
from
guinness
draft
overall
this
is
by
no
means
an
undrinkable
beer
fairly
well
balanced
in
the
flavor
no
overwhelming
flavors
just
a
strange
mouthfeel
is
what
really
doesnt
do
it
for
me
if
you
really
like
stouts
and
are
in
missouri
give
this
one
a
shot
poured
into
a
shaker
at
the
boulevard
brewpub
kc
airport
a
longlasting
onefinger
nitrohead
capped
off
a
superdark
ruby
body
the
head
left
some
thick
and
slick
lacing
the
nose
had
a
sweet
light
coffee
aroma
with
a
bit
of
roast
the
taste
was
good
and
highly
roasted
with
hints
of
smoke
it
was
exceptionally
dry
and
bitter
but
began
with
an
initial
quick
sweetness
it
also
had
a
welcome
bit
of
vinous
acidity
the
mouth
was
medium
thick
with
very
light
carbonation
a
rich
but
surprisingly
quaffable
stout
overall
impression
nicely
drinkable
stout
not
quite
as
standout
as
the
porter
but
still
very
nice
not
a
bad
beer
similar
to
your
bigger
brand
name
dry
stouts
such
as
guinness
and
murphys
but
without
the
nitroinduced
creaminess
this
one
is
pretty
good
at
holding
its
own
recommended
this
came
with
a
very
thick
deeptan
head
it
was
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
reddish
highlights
it
gave
off
a
pleasant
cocoachocolate
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
full
as
a
direct
result
of
the
pour
i
got
a
good
chocolate
taste
in
the
mouth
the
finish
had
both
cocoa
and
a
light
smokiness
this
would
be
good
with
fish
or
dessert
imho
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
near
black
ruby
hues
at
bottom
with
good
head
and
now
a
ring
around
the
top
no
lacing
aroma
is
classic
stout
but
not
anything
special
with
really
just
roasted
malts
and
no
other
hints
or
flavors
taste
is
a
little
more
appealing
roasty
and
a
mild
hint
of
coffee
grounds
a
nice
dry
finish
but
still
lacking
a
bit
the
mouth
isnt
really
that
full
a
little
too
thin
and
entirely
too
carbonated
with
little
creaminess
to
balance
carbonation
out
for
me
this
started
out
good
but
every
successive
bottle
i
drink
leaves
me
yearning
for
more
and
more
again
bummer
pours
a
deep
almost
black
brown
with
deep
garnet
highlights
good
sturdy
head
and
thick
foam
with
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
even
dry
but
a
good
coffee
bean
dry
with
some
hints
of
cotton
balls
plenty
of
tootsie
rolllike
chocolate
mixed
with
some
deep
roasted
and
surprisingly
smoked
malts
by
surprisingly
i
mean
that
i
wasnt
expecting
that
much
smokey
flavor
of
a
dry
palate
at
the
finish
but
if
i
would
let
the
taste
linger
for
about
five
minutes
the
feeling
is
one
of
great
refreshment

only
non

of

i
adjusted
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
when
compared
to
the
nitro
cans
the
head
on
this
is
weak
but
it
has
a
fuller
mouthfeel
it
may
be
apples
and
oranges

when
one

irish

the
ususal
is
a
nitro
can
of
murphys
beamish
or

so
i
used
those
as
the

still
this
beer
is
good

dry
stout
is

in

with

the

it
is
medium

and
moderatly
carbonated
there
are
better
irish

out
there
but
this
one
is
not

i
just

a
little
chocolate
taste
as
well
but
it
also
has
hints
of
caramel
flavor
it
is
kind
of
bitter
as
well
it
drinks
very
smoothly
overall
i
think
is
a
pretty
solid
dry
stout
not
the
best
irish
stout
ive
tasted
so
far
but
certainly
a
drinkable
example
of
the
style
this
stout
can
only
muster
a
thin
brittle
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
it
has
a
light
roasted
chocolate
aroma
the
flavor
is
water
roasted
coffee
with
light
coacoa
and
earthy
hop
notes
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
overcarbonated
for
the
style
this
is
very
mediocre
beer
hard
to
believe
that
this
and
that
killer
porter
can
come
from
the
same
brewer
overall
more
impressed
by
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
the
flavor
actually
seemed
like
somewhat
of
a
letdown
this
is
an
opaque
stout
that
pours
into
my
glass
with
a
flourish
of
foam
that
settles
rather
quickly
the
roasted
coffee
bean
aroma
is
rather
pleasant
with
hints
of
milk
chocolate
present
too
i
detect
the
flavors
of
chocolate
and
bitter
hops
before
a
lightly
bitterchocolate
finish
full
of
prickly
carbonation
this
beer
does
pretty
well
for
a
light
bodied
stout
and
comes
across
as
a
pretty
tasty
session
beer
i
would
like
a
touch
more
coffee
flavor
maybe
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
and
a
less
prickly
carbonation
but
this
otherwise
a
tasty
dry
stout
im
dont
think
boulevard
does
this
but
a
caskconditioned
example
could
be
divine
this
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
tiny
tiny
tan
head
par
for
the
course
just
nothing
special
the
aroma
is
barely
there
a
deep
whiff
brings
just
a
touch
of
roastiness
but
just
a
touch
why
the
taste
brings
some
of
the
roastiness
forward
but
again
not
much
and
if
it
werent
for
the
aftertaste
id
have
to
question
whether
or
not
i
was
drinking
a
macros
attempt
at
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
lighterbodied
stout
again
average
but
nothing
remarkable
drinkable
yes
this
is
more
of
a
session
beer
than
anything
really
if
they
remarketed
this
beer
as
a
mild
id
be
more
happy
with
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
weak
example
of
a
dry
stout
akin
to
something
you
might
expect
from
a
macro
not
remarkable
not
memorable
thanks
to
bditty187
for
this
beer
almost
no
head
or
head
retention
slight
smokey
sweet
smell
and
quite
dark
appearance
a
little
roasted
flavor
no
coffee
slight
malt
sweetness
with
equally
slight
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
becomes
a
little
more
pronounced
if
you
wait
for
it
to
warm
up
and
swish
it
around
in
your
mouth
the
coffee
flavor
finally
comes
into
play
as
well
as
a
hop
bitterness
that
wasnt
there
before
but
still
no
real
aftertaste
this
beer
is
lacking
in
character
and
body
i
like
the
idea
of
a
bottle
conditioned
dry
stout
and
the
extra
carbonation
it
gives
compared
to
the
nitro
canbottle
this
one
needs
a
little
work
smooth
and
very
drinkable
less
filling
than
guinness
but
still
satisfying
slightly
milder
flavor
could
make
it
more
acceptable
to
nonstout
drinkers
so
punk
bands
that
go
pop
are
a
dime
a
dozen
now
a
days
a
good
coffeeesk
stout
are
not
lucky
me
i
have
access
to
try
boulevards
dry
stout
again
the
sour
does
fade
a
bit
as
it
warms
i
will
start
by
saying
that
i
had
expected
more
from
this
one
i
typically
like
the
offerings
from
boulevard
and
expected
this
one
to
be
strong
as
well
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
sadly
i
found
the
pour
unimpressive
with
a
1
12
finger
head
that
dwindled
quickly
very
dark
color
looks
tough
and
inviting
with
a
full
body
smell
that
would
bring
promise
of
heavy
malts
and
some
bite
from
a
floral
whiff
the
taste
was
disappointing
burnt
and
almost
stale
the
drink
date
on
the
beer
is
thanksgiving
day
which
should
be
safe
not
to
say
that
it
is
the
freshest
that
bb
has
on
the
shelf
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
more
than
anything
overall
this
beer
had
some
things
going
for
it
but
it
didnt
hit
where
it
counted
i
think
i
may
try
it
again
to
check
for
freshness
mouthfeel
is
semi
dry
and
slightly
sweet
the
taste
is
also
rich
but
subtle
the
roastiness
and
coffee
play
very
nicely
with
the
chocolate
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
quite
quaffable
at
that
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anybody
very
drinkable
will
seek
this
out
next
time
i
am
in
the
midwest
i
went
straight
for
another
one
after
the
first
would
totally
drink
again
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
theres
no
way
around
this
one
sorry
on
tap
at
flying
saucer
in
little
rock
ar
the
bartended
kept
removing
the
foam
from
the
pint
till
the
glass
poured
near
full
quite
a
site
all
in
all
not
a
bad
stout
worth
drinking
calories
149
per
12
ounces
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
subdued
but
has
some
roasted
malts
and
some
coffee
in
there
pleasant
the
flavor
is
mostly
comprised
of
the
roasted
malt
pretty
boring
actually
tasty
dont
get
me
wrong
but
it
lacks
a
bit
in
body
and
theres
no
catch
here
drinkability
is
good
boulevard
dry
stout
doesnt
taste
like
the
big
three
dry
stouts
but
in
this
case
it
works
out
well
its
an
enjoyable
beer
on
its
own
merits
and
being
a
little
different
makes
this
a
good
session
stout
check
it

i
wish
the
flavor
was
a
little
more
robust
all
flavors
were
weak
chalky
and
dry
mouth
feel
this
beer
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
slightly
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
slightly
coffee
and
slight
chocolate
the
flavor
is
nice
and
rich
roasted
coffee
with
a
more
chocolatey
finish
the
coffee
bitter
fades
nicely
into
a
sweet
aftertaste
the
feel
is
moderate
and
drying
on
the
finish
very
nice
this
is
definately
well
worth
looking
into
i
like
the
flavor
and
feel
a
lot
i
could
easily
sit
and
drink
this
one

very
drinkable
for
me

gave
the

a

taste
and
got
a
whoooo
outa
her
i
had
another
this
stout
poured
an
opaque
black
color
with
tall
creamy
light
brown
foam
that
persisted
a
while
but
then
settled
clinging
a
bit
the
smell
was
roastedmalty
with
a
light
yeasty
aroma
the
taste
was
full
or
roasted
malt
and
barley
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
fruitiness
the
hoppiness
seemed
light
compared
to
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
dry
overall
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
it
was
relatively
clean
this
was

brown

over
a
pitch
black
beer
smells
are
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
sweet
caramel
too
combined
they
make
molasses
i
guess
smells
very
sweet
and
creamy
almost
oatmeal
stoutish
if
there
are
hops
in
the
aroma
im
guessing
fuggles
tastes
coffee
to
start
which
fades
gently
to
a
late
chocolate
sour
cherries
in
the
end
too
thats
about
it
not
much
to
say
as
theres
not
much
here
if
theres
any
hop
bitter
its
blended
into
or
hidden
by
the
mediumheavy
carbonation
more
than
i
want
in
a
stout
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
and
a
roasted
roughness
left
on
my
tongue
after
the
swallow
this
bottle
offering
is
much
better
than
i
expected
as
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
found
it
to
be
watery
almost
opaque
thin
light
brown
head
lacing
is
adequate
theres
a
nice
dry
roasted
aroma
here
a
little
nutty
like
roasted
almonds
but
also
like
roasted
coffee
bean
and
roasted
malt
some
light
roasted
malt
tones
on
the
palate
a
little
coffee
maybe
some
vanilla
and
caramel
tones
but
just
not
a
lot
of
depth
really
its
agreeable
but
not
special
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
watery
lightly
carbonated
decent
brew
but
i
wouldnt
go
quite
so
far
as
to
say
its
good
boulevard
dry
stout
is
a
stout
a
dry
one
as
well
there
is
just
not
a
lot
of
hoopla
here
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
out
the
color
was
very
dark
not
completely
opaque
though
the
head
was
nice
full
and
fluffy
but
dissipated
somewhat
quickly
as
large
bubbles
formed
and
burst
but
i
greatly
prefer
this
real
type
of
head
over
the
fake
nitrogen
one
you
get
from
some
beers
this
beer
is
bottle
conditioned
and
it
shows
in
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
aroma
features
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
then
hits
you
with
a
nice
malty
grainy
note
the
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
good
blend
of
malt
roasty
sharp
bitterness
and
backofthetongue
hop
notes
as
well
it
may
have
been
a
little
less
dry
than
i
expected
although
this
is
hardly
a
dig
on
the
beer
the
body
was
nice
and
full
overall
an
excellent
drinkable
beer
courtesy
of
buckeyenation
pours
a
slightly
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
thin
beige
head
that
disappeared
pretty
quickly
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
lightly
roasty
with
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
mediumbodied
and
sort
of
watery
at
times
coffee
and
hops
in
the
flavor
but
not
with
much
authority
the
finish
is
dry
and
roasty
overall
this
stout
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
drinkability
was
at
best
average
relatively
weak
effort
from
a
solid
brewery
appearance
pours
a
dark
ruby
deep
brown
practically
black
forms
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
good
overall
appearance
the
head
seems
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
or
fizzy
dwindles
quickly
leaving
sporadic
lacing
down
the
glass
not
bad
aroma
dark
roasts
consume
most
of
the
aromatics
but
there
is
a
great
herbal
hop
profile
that
must
be
noted
seems
very
fresh
with
almost
a
hint
of
chocolate
mint
not
a
lot
of
mint
just
leaves
that
impression
on
me
in
a
good
way
taste
perfect
example
of
a
dry
irish
stout
creeps
on
the
palate
with
decently
robust
dark
roasts
leaving
a
lingering
dryness
on
the
palate
however
this
one
contains
a
nice
splash
of
hop
character
bringing
out
some
mildly
earthy
and
herbal
notes
very
nice
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
brew
carbonation
settles
nicely
not
overbearing
in
anyway
a
very
smooth
brew
in
my
opinion
drinkability
wow
i
could
definitely
spend
an
afternoon
imbibing
on
a
few
of
these
very
nice
overall
flavorful
dry
irish
stout
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
the
sample
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
nice
as
it
should
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
maybe
a
finger
and
a
half
high
head
dissapates
rather
quickly
though
not
a
ton
going
on
in
aroma
slight
roasty
aroma
flavor
is
well
kinda
bland
some
sharp
roasty
bitterness
in
the
end
but
not
a
ton
going
on
a
slight
tartness
ala
guiness
also
has
a
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
but
not
bad
for
the
style
i
could
drink
these
but
id
probably
look
for
something
else
black
crayon
hue
with
a
light
tan
head
considerable
lacing
noted
some
chocolate
malts
and
sweetness
detected
in
the
aroma
yes
it
just
smells
somewhat
sweet
up
front
yes
it
is
dry
a
near
cottonmouth
effect
some
chocolateroasted
malts
some
coffee
bean
tastings
are
also
present
medium
based
body
just
a
slight
offering
of
bitter
hops
boy
the
name
dry
stands
out
not
sure
what
clears
the
palate
but
after
two
of
these
a
pitcher
of
water
could
be
handy
still
not
a
bad
stout
pours
jet
black
color
decent
size
light
brown
head
that
doesnt
last
with
no
lacing
has
light
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
dark
roasted
malty
chocolate
and
dark
fruity
flavors
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
maybe
a
little
thin
finishes
with
a
very
dry
bitterness
and
as
someone
else
reviewed
earlier
the
draught
version
of
this
is
much
better
on
its
own
and
also
makes
a
good
black
tan
with
their
pale
or
a
thundercloud
with
their
wheat
most
above
average
bars
around
kc
will
have
all
three
available
for
mixing
thanks
to
bditty
for
the
bottle
boulevard
dry
stout
isnt
really
that
good
its
a
slightly
different
take
on
the
style
but
one
that
doesnt
do
much
for
me
drinkable
yes
but
i
cant
see
myself
buying
it
again
dry
is
definitely
the
operative
term
for
this
beer
very
dry
indeed
pours
out
a
dark
rich
brown
almost
black
head
is
very
nice
some
lacing
and
the
aroma
is
well
stout
smoky
almost
ashy
in
taste
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
little
bitter
aftertastea
nice
bite
very
complex
it
changes
its
taste
as
it
goes
down
but
has
a
thick
chalky
mouthfeel
overall
a
solid
offering
from
my
hometown
brewery
i
regret
to
write
a
bad
review
of
anything
from
boulevard
wanna
stay
loyal
to
the
local
brew
but
this
is
a
pisspoor
offering
there
was
a
good
reason
they
never
released
this
in
bottles
until
recentlyits
not
good
on
tap
now
thats
a
different
story
i
like
the
dry
stout
on
tap
its
a
thinner
easier
drinking
session
stout
compared
to
thicker
chewier
stouts
like
insert
any
stout
name
here
but
i
like
that
on
tap
dry
stout
at
least
has
some
toasty
stoutlike
flavors
in
the
bottle
none
to
me
this
is
the
flattest
most
tasteless
stout
ive
ever
had
i
guess
if
you
normally
drink
macro
brew
and
prefer
very
little
flavor
in
your
beer
this
may
be
a
choice
for
you
so
you
can
look
cool
drinking
a
dark
beer
im
not
saying
this
is
an
outright
bad
beer
but
it
lacks
anything
good
especially
for
a
stout
this
beer
tastes
good
but
i
expected
something
more
ummm
stout
for
flavor
ill
take
a
boulevard
bully
porter
over
this
any
time
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
im
impressed
with
the
2
beers
ive
had
from
boulevard
and
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
sample
more
of
their
beers
big
thank
you
to
bditty187
for
the
bottle
pours
to
a
fluffy
tan
head
and
nearly
opaque
blackruby
color
i
had
a
very
hard
time
seeing
through
this
stout
head
dissipated
to
a
thin
film
with
hurricane
swirl
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
roasted
barley
dominates
the
nose
with
hints
of
burnt
popcorn
flavor
is
dry
and
roasty
with
bitterness
coming
mainly
from
the
roasted
grain
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
finishes
roasty
and
coffeelike
a
very
pleasing
bottled
stout
i
bet
this
tastes
10x
better
on
nitro
draught
this
beer
is
completly
black
and
even
held
to
light
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
hint
of
red
fairly
small
brown
head
topping
it
off
scent
is
totally
roasted
malts
no
room
for
debate
on
that
one
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
more
subdued
than
i
would
have
guessed
from
the
scent
its
roasted
malt
i
think
the
name
dry
stout
sums
this
beer
up
quite
well
what
youd
expect
not
a
bad
drink
a
solid
if
not
stellar
stout
ahhh
my
quest
to
try
this
brew
is
complete
being
a
total
fan
of
the
boulevard
line
i
felt
like
i
was
in
for
a
wonderful
treat
i
recieved
my
pint
glass
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
beautiful
cascading
bubbles
down
the
side
nice
dark
dark
brown
color
creamy
white
head
lacing
all
over
the
place
smell
was
roasted
nuttyness
though
not
as
strong
as
i
was
expecting
taste
well
not
what
i
was
expecting
either
i
think
they
went
a
little
too
far
on
the
dryness
very
subdued
flavor
nice
roasted
maltiness
just
not
very
much
of
it
mouthfeel
was
the
best
part
of
this
brew
my
god
man
just
try
this
beer
for
that
very
creamy
and
velvety
smooth
so
very
very
creamy
i
could
definately
drink
these
but
it
would
be
nice
if
they
could
give
this
a
little
bam
it
could
be
such
an
awesome
brew
instead
of
being
just
above
average
taste
also
is
lacking
a
bit
not
overtly
bad
in
anyway
just
not
for
such
a
dark
beer
there
is
much
roasted
flavor
beer
is
thick
in
the
mouth
but
lacking
in
flavor
this
looked
almost
identical
to
a
guinness
when
he
brought
it
out
if
i
hadnt
seen
him
pour
it
i
might
have
mistaken
one
for
the
other
the
aroma
is
fairly
nonexistent
the
taste
is
a
bit
weak
for
a
stout
but
some
hints
of
roastiness
also
a
hair
of
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
a
better
session
beer
boulevard
dry
stout
perfect
for
nights
out
when
youre
counting
carbs
but
want
more
than
1
beer
the
nose
was
lightly
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
coffee
it
has
a
soothing
aroma
to
it
the
flavors
are
light
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
faint
bitter
hops
and
as
the
name
states
it
finishes
dry
you
want
to
have
another
the
body
is
black
and
the
head
is
creamy
tan
and
influenced
by
the
nitro
tap
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
lightish
stout
with
enjoyable
flavors
i
will
gladly
have
another
this
brew
is
a
thick
redblack
color
with
fantastic
head
retention
the
aroma
is
light
an
roasted
when
they
named
this
beer
dry
they
werent
kidding
it
is
so
dry
the
flavor
turns
up
quite
watery
the
brew
is
quite
fullbodied
and
smooth
but
a
little
more
malt
sweetness
would
be
great
near
black
in
color
with
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
lasted
until
the
end
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
with
very
slight
malt
the
flavor
was
very
roasty
with
little
chocolate
in
the
taste
and
the
malty
sweetness
appeared
towards
the
end
of
the
aftertaste
it
was
smooth
but
a
bit
too
thin
ie
watery
it
is
more
flavorful
than
the
guiness
but
if
you
like
a
fullflavored
stout
kind
of
the
definition
of
stout
there
are
better
ones
out
there
since
i
am
not
a
stout
person
i
thought
it
had
a
good
flavor
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
though
tan
creamy
dense
sticky
head
after
the
nitro
casacde
effect
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
malt
in
aroma
but
other
malt
notes
are
absent
hop
bitterness
is
fairly
low
for
style
gives
way
to
malt
sweetness
unusual
for
a
dry
stout
the
chocolate
malt
flavor
is
mellow
and
pleasant
but
sharp
black
patent
andor
roasted
barley
notes
are
absent
in
this
brew
richer
in
body
than
draught
guinness
but
roasted
barley
contributions
are
lacking
roasted
grain
bitterness
manages
to
eek
its
way
into
the
finish
a
decent
stout
but
its
a
bit
too
soft
on
the
palette
more
bitterness
both
from
roasted
barley
and
hops
wouldve
made
this
a
better
dry
stout
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
beers
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
interested
all
the
way
through
yet
not
so
intense
that
it
bogs
you
down
after
one
or
two
excellent
taste
is
empty
and
thin
yes
thin
is
the
theme
i
know
that
irish
drys
are
thinner
than
their
american
counterparts
but
i
would
like
more
body
best
flavor
is
it
the
aftertaste
with
light
coffee
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
frappe
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
stays
true
to
the
style
but
does
not
stand
out
enough
to
warrant
a
repeat
purchase
too
thin
and
astringent
for
a
stout
im
a
big
fan
of
this
american
take
on
a
classic
style
its
packed
with
flavor
and
complexity
youd
expect
from
a
bigger
stout
but
is
still
light
and
easy
drinking
love
love
love
if
i
can
find
bottles
of
this
it
would
be
my
go
to
easy
drinking
dark
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
it
has
a
roast
nose
coffee
and
chocolate
with
some
sweet
notes
it
pours
dense
black
it
has
the
dry
stout
roast
and
burnt
barley
bitterness
but
it
has
traces
of
sweetness
in
the
background
that
are
separate
from
the
roast
the
body
is
medium
full
and
the
carbonation
medium
overall
not
a
bad
go
at
an
irish
stout
a
little
more
identity
to
the
flavor
profile
rather
than
being
everything
and
nothing
at
the
same
time
and
this
could
be
fantastic
as
it
stands
its
solid
like
a
guinness
but
even
tastier
ill
give
brooklyn
dry
irish
stout
brooklyn
brewery
a
4
25
this
is
an
easygoing
stout
that
you
can
knock
back
a
couple
of
and
not
feel
sleepy
nicely
done
by
these
guys
wish
it
had
a
little
more
body
good
o
ok
but
not
very
interesting
not
as
creamy
as
guinness
and
does
not
have
as
strong
of
the
roasted
barley
taste
a
bit
more
watery
light
for
a
stout
definitely
decent
but
not
the
ultimate
poured
dark
caramel
brown
persistent
tan
head
that
leaves
a
ring
and
wet
slippery
lace
pours
with
a
thickness
nose
is
roasty
grain
smooth
sweetness
from
caramel
under
that
earthy
coffee
and
a
malty
sweetness
taste
is
good
sharp
and
full
of
flavor
roasty
gran
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
to
give
it
edge
drinks
dry
and
very
crisp
lightly
sweet
a
smooth
and
quick
drink
that
finishes
dry
and
with
plenty
of
maltiness
to
linger
textbook
dry
stout
with
a
rich
and
full
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
too
so
why
would
i
want
an
irish
style
stout
brewed
in
the
us
to
celebrate
saint
patricks
day
of
course
although
guinness
is
seen
as
quintessentially
irish
its
actually
an
english
company
that
persecuted
the
irish
arthur
was
a
committed
unionist
and
opponent
of
irish
nationalism
and
his
decedents
financially
supported
the
ulster
volunteer
force
and
allegedly
lent
men
and
equipment
to
the
british
army
during
the
easter
rising
of
1916
so
this
year
ill
have
a
murphys
a
beamish
or
a
brooklyn
but
i
wont
support
guinness
dry
tasteless
beer
this
is
not
what
a
irish
stout
should
taste
like
maybe
the
line
is
bad
but
this
is
crap
this
beer
isnt
bad
its
terrible
shame
on
brooklyn
brewery
for
coming
out
with
this
beer
when
their
chocolate
stout
is
one
of
my
favorites
its
not
a
bad
stout
good
carbonation
lotsa
flavor
the
right
amount
of
char
a
decent
drinking
beer
355
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pitch
brownishblack
with
a
moderate
amount
of
tan
head
that
settles
out
quickly
into
a
thin
topcoat
aroma
is
rather
subdued
but
pleasant
milk
chocolate
is
the
main
vibe
i
am
getting
along
with
coffee
and
hints
of
caramel
and
charcoal
slight
earthy
goldings
hop
palate
flips
the
script
and
is
predominantly
coffee
more
earthy
and
dry
than
the
nose
suggests
hints
of
red
berry
drinkable
read
thin
bodied
rather
fizzy
and
slightly
citric
the
sour
note
is
likely
an
attempt
to
emulate
the
vaunted
guinness
soured
flavor
and
frankly
manages
to
trump
the
original
although
this
is
perhaps
better
described
as
an
alkaline
soda
effect
here
not
bad
but
finishes
strangely
empty
and
i
think
the
intended
target
was
overshot
with
regards
to
sessionability
looking
for
the
flavors
to
pop
more
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
a
brew
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
nose
is
a
nice
roast
hops
with
an
airy
scent
of
coffee
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
almost
black
like
liquid
dark
chocolate
head
has
small
bubbles
rich
in
appearance
that
hugs
the
inner
glass
second
nose
now
detects
the
chocolate
but
barely
first
taste
is
light
more
coffee
than
chocolate
although
its
there
cant
really
call
it
mocha
for
the
two
are
distinct
on
their
own
i
dont
think
they
roasted
the
hops
as
long
as
one
might
usually
to
produce
a
porter
doppelbock
or
especially
a
stout
surprisingly
crisp
at
the
finish
one
disappointment
of
the
dry
irish
stout
is
that
with
all
these
interactions
i
found
it
somewhat
one
dimensional
the
flavours
and
the
ingredients
didnt
seem
to
be
layered
together
as
well
i
thought
it
ought
to
be
still
this
is
a
very
good
yet
disarmingly
easygoing
brew
bottom
line
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
how
flavor
is
not
all
it
takes
for
a
brew
these
days
there
is
a
substantial
flavor
but
its
seems
one
dimensional
especially
without
a
robust
texture
to
match
not
too
bitter
and
a
good
overall
feel
to
it
subdued
nose
primarily
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
about
the
same
gentle
malt
and
caramel
a
touch
of
charcoal
mouth
feel
is
tart
to
begin
finishes
slightly
drying
stout
light
is
what
this
is
i
guess
drinkable
and
inoffensive
but
no
real
excitement
in
the
glass
enjoy
very
dark
pour
but
with
a
very
light
head
the
smell
was
mostly
of
sweet
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
floral
notes
on
the
end
the
taste
was
a
lot
of
heavy
caramel
flavor
with
the
floral
hops
cutting
the
end
for
a
clean
refreshing
finish
the
biggest
problem
i
had
with
the
beer
is
that
it
was
very
thin
for
a
stout
overall
i
thought
it
was
an
interesting
take
on
stouts
and
thought
it
was
worth
the
try
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
irish
stouts
this
is
a
great
american
nonnitro
take
on
the
style
relatively
straightforward
but
still
very
rewarding
o
i
really
hope
this
is
a
bad
bottle
because
very
little
about
this
beer
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
better
irish
dry
stouts
on
the
market
i
tend
to
be
a
fan
of
brooklyn
brewery
but
some
of
their
recent
products
concern
me
this
one
is
a
real
bummer
doing
little
to
assuage
my
fears
that
the
quality
of
the
brewerys
output
has
been
slipping
over
the
past
couple
of
years
o
a
fine
example
of
the
style
its
drinkable
yet
a
bit
more
substantial
than
other
dry
stouts
after
i
veg
on
a
whole
bottle
of
it
my
skepticism
was
confirmed
its
not
that
dry
and
doesnt
really
have
the
bold
flavor
of
a
regular
stout
still
a
decent
beer
thats
worth
a
try
pours
a
solid
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
decent
sized
bubbly
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
on
top
aromas
of
bitter
coffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
earth
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
bitter
roast
and
light

moderate

58
a
b
grade
while
its
not
the
most
interesting
stout
ive
ever
tried
brooklyns
dry
irish
stout
is
still
a
solid
example
of
this
highly
sessionable
style
the
flavour
profile
should
be
quite
agreeable
to
most
palates
although
the
thin
body
and
weak
aftertaste
prevents
this
from
being
a
truly
outstanding
stout
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
anyone
curious
and
something
that
i
would
consider
picking
up
again
its
certainly
better
than
guinness
although
its
probably
not
as
pretty
o
this
is
how
i
remember
stouts
from
my
youth
not
particularly
dry
but
certainly
not
sweet
either
i
was
surprised
at
the
low
alcohol
content
considering
the
taste
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
for
sure
fairly
disappointing
and
definitely
the
worst
brooklyn
brewery
offering
that
ive
tried
to
date
started
okay
but
went
downhill
from
their
with
the
taste
in
particular
failing
to
impress
i
felt
this
one
was
more
of
a
gimmick
from
the
brewery
and
not
really
up
to
the
standard
of
the
previous
brooklyn
beers
overall
very
tasty
brew
with
a
great
feel
thirstquenching
and
flavorful
yet
light
enough
that
i
wouldnt
be
restricted
to
one
or
two
of
these
which
usually
i
am
on
darker
beers
poured
out
a
deep
clear
brown
with
about
12
finger
of
tan
head
there
is
minimal
retention
but
a
smattering
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
nice
hint
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
follows
closely
with
the
aroma
with
the
hops
coming
in
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
to
style
with
a
thinner
quality
overall
this
is
a
wellexecuted
irish
stout
pours
out
a
dark
brownruby
almost
black
body
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
very
malty
toasty
and
roasty
hops
are
a
faint
whisper
of
an
aroma
flavor
is
very
light
with
subtle
malt
sweetness
and
a
roasted
backbone
finishes
very
dry
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
carbonation
could
be
a
touch
smoother
i
always
look
forward
to
this
release
a
great
session
stout
still
thinking
about
all
the
carbonation
owell
it
tastes
better
than
bottled
guinness
does
most
of
the
time
in
the
us
this
coming
from
a
guinness
fan
but
lets
be
honest
the
quality
has
plummeted
recently
seems
like
a
pretty
standard
irish
dry
stout
low
abv
didnt
feel
like
it
weighed
a
ton
so
even
though
im
satisfied
with
one
a
few
could
be
had
in
a
night
overall
drinkability
not
a
wow
stout
but
very
drinkable
and
tasty
enough
to
reach
for
another
without
qualm
i
think
it
is
overcarbonated
for
style
but
otherwise
a
good
enough
beer
went
well
with
corned
beef
and
colcannon
indeed
i
dont
see
how
brooklyn
dry
irish
stout
has
any
less
mainstream
appeal
than
say
their
lager
or
summer
ale
its
every
bit
as
approachable
and
mildmannered
the
dark
appearance
may
intimidate
some
cowards
out
there
but
those
who
muster
the
courage
to
get
over
their
irrational
fear
will
surely
learned
that
theres
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
b
generally
a
drinkable
beer
o
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
there
are
better
options
available
this
is
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
a
stout
newcomer
as
its
soft
and
thin
but
still
has
enough
flavor
to
introduce
cheers
overall
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
guinness
lager
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
has
some
lager
like
qualities
to
it
good
but
forgettable
great
example
pf
a
dry
irish
stout
smells
of
roast
malts
and
slight
coffee
and
smoke
taste
compliments
the
aroma
almost
spot
on
body
is
medium
light
very
drinkable
overall
an
enjoyable
and
sessionable
stout
can
be
enjoyed
amongst
friends
for
hours
overall
this
is
a
nice
stout
id
certainly
have
this
again
o
another
beer
that
made
me
want
pretzels
because
it
lacked
enough
flavor
or
bite

a
really
nice
session
stout
actually
pretty
bold
on
the
roasty
flavor
on
the
back
end
but
pretty
brisk
as
well
some
sweeter
grains
up
front
followed
by
a
huge
explosion
of
roasted
grains
coffee
flavor
bitter
black
chocolate
the
beer
delivers
with
a
nice
super
dry
yet
balanced
finish
and
a
lingering
roastiness
not
bitter
but
balanced
very
nicely
medium
bodied
burnt
toast
ends
and
toasted
hearty
breads
great
flavor
and
amazing
drinkability
it
took
me
three
bottles
on
different
dates
before
writing
this
review
i
wasnt
very
fond
of
dry
irish
stouts
but
have
now
taken
a
liking
to
them
after
given
this
beer
and
others
several
chances
great
sessionable
stout
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
irish
dry
stout
but
maybe
a
little
pedestrian
compared
to
other
stouts
that
ive
had
i
enjoyed
it
and
if
offered
will
enjoy
it
again
but
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
it
overall
this
beer
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
i
didnt
find
it
lived
up
to
what
i
expected
from
brooklyn
and
perhaps
i
had
too
high
expectations
i
am
hoping
that
my
next
brooklyn
beer
is
redeeming
beer
is
light
in
body
with
carbonation
of
low
to
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
light
though
not
fizzy
but
rather
watery
not
quite
right
for
the
style
closes
fairly
dry
with
little
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate

oh
well
its
just
a
couple
months
after
that
now
served
in

glass
the
beer
pours
dark

with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
it
tastes
mostly
like
roasted
malt
and
coffee
along
with
some
bittersweet
chocolate
burntcharred
malt
and
a
bit
of
cream
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
moderate
carbonation
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
mix
6pack
at
kroger
earlier
today
i
think
i
might
have
to
try
this
fresher
when
it
comes
out
again
next
year
i
liked
it
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
fine
very
drinkable
brew
well
made
as
i
would
expect
from
this
quality
brewer
good
stout
with
great
drinkability
very
fun
to
drink
in
winter
and
summertime
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
coffee
some
smokiness
taste
is
smooth
coffee
lots
of
roasted
malts
very
sessionable
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
feel
is
good
carbonation
is
on
point
and
finishes
dry
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
pretty
good
id
still
order
this
over
guinness
draught
as
that
beer
has
certainly
not
been
up
to
par
with
me
for
a
while
o
not
bad
a
decent
take
on
a
dry
stout
o
no
apparent
flaws
but
rather
mild
flavor
and
not
very
complex
or
interesting
either
this
is
consistent
with
all
the
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
hitting
classic
styles
in
a
evenhanded
and
highly
drinkable
manner
it
was
consistent
with
my
expectations
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
this
is
not
the
type
of
beer
that
i
drink
often
but
its
a
surprisingly
delicious
brew
from
a
brewery
that
never
quite
gets
it
right
to
me
this
will
have
to
be
added
to
my
tasty
sub6
cheap
beer
rotation
along
with
yuenglings
bock
and
longtrail
ale
too
bad
i
dont
see
it
around
that
often
rjt
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
12
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
earthy
bitter
black
malt
scent
along
with
a
hint
of
roasted
character
and
irish
stout
yeast
its
quite
dry
just
the
way
it
should
be
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
bone
dry
black
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
quick
and
easy
and
finishes
bitter
and
earthy
its
true
to
style
and
highly
quaffable
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
seasonal
beer
its
so
smooth
and
sessionable
its
tasty
but
if
i
were
doing
the
whole
thing
blind
i
would
assume
it
was
a
brown
ale
im
still
happy
to
drink
it
tho
o
3
5
below
average
for
style
i
drank
it
alongside
with
my
dry
irish
stout
homebrew
i
really
like
brooklyns
stouts
especially
their
bcs
see
my
review
for
glorious
praise
and
black
ops
but
this
one
was
really
underwhelming
due
to
the
lack
of
dry
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
as
advertised
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
again
but
if
offered
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
it
blossoms
as
it
warms
and
gives
a
good
bouquet
with
a
coffee
like
profile
a
bit
of
dough
some
sweet
molasses
notes
flow
in
here
and
there
taste
is
like
the
name
dark
roasted
grain
front
with
a
lots
of
coffee
and
charred
grains
sweetness
is
of
the
burnt
variety
and
fleeting
at
that
finish
is
short
and
earthy
with
lots
of
dark
grains
and
a
touch
of
ale
yeast
very
smooth
drinking
feel
is
crisp
and
light
with
well
proportioned
carbonation
that
lends
itself
to
sessioning
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
that
is
an
excellent
session
beer
with
a
full
flavor
a
tasty
enough
irish
dry
stout
with
a
fair
bit
more
sweetness
than
expected
but
that
doesnt
really
matter
as
it
all
works
together

produce
a
commendable

has

is
easy
to

pleasantly

o
the

to
overpower
the

the

was

the

of

roasted

and
a
good
bit
of
ripe

hops
all
giving
this
a
rich

the
taste
is
the

with

some
rather
assertive

a

maybe
it

those

really
had
a
nice

them
with
this

having
richness
to
the
flavors
that
i
wasnt
expecting
maybe
not
exactly
to

i
really
enjoyed
this
a
fine
dark

with
a
smooth
taste
not
heavy
as
you
would
expect
a

to

not

full

taste
as
i
would
like
far
from
over
powering
for
those
concerned
by
the
appearance
the
light
taste
does
not
make
this
a
must
beer
for
me
but
it
is
not
bad
give
it
a
try
poured

the

perhaps
a
little

the
taste
is
okay
light
roasted

but
something
seems
missing
not
my
favorite
from
them
overall
a
nice
little
dry
stout
with
some
character
perfect
session
brew
overall
this
isnt
bad
it
looks
good
and
smells
good
and
the
flavor
profile
is
good
but
the
feel
is
wrong
and
i
think
its
overcarbonated
for
the
style
which
detracts
from
the
overall
presentation
with
some
slight
tweaking
i
think
this
could
be
a
lot
better
but
as
it
is
its
a
slightly
disappointing
though
still
decent
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
misses
the
mark
in
a
lot
of
areas
i
am
so
stoked
to
drink
this
today
the

just

at

about

in
advertising
the
nose
smelled
of
strong
black
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
freshly
dug
dirt
spot
on
lads
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
roastiness
of
the
malt
was
the
prevalent
flavor
in
the
mouth
i
would
put
it
more
towards
coffee
than
chocolate
in
terms
of
initial
flavor
it
was
on
the
finish
that
i
really
tasted
the
dark
chocolate
strongly
the
lacing
clung
to
the
glass
the
way
i
clung
to
my
maternal
grummys
leg
as
she
moved
about
in
her
kitchen
making
irish
soda
bread
and
other
traditional
meals
when
i
was
but
a
wee
one
this
was
the
perfect
beer
to
start
the
day
may
the
roof
above
your
heads
never
fall
in
and
may
the
friends
underneath
it
never
fall
out
o
nothing
fantastic
but
definitely
decent
especially
for
10
99128oz
on
st
pattys
day
i
am
typically
not
a
huge
fan
of
brooklyn
or
the
style
for
that
matter
i
guess
when
the
style
is
crappy
nitro
abominations
that
is
to
be
expected
though
this
is
excellent
subtle
but
with
plenty
of
character
to
go
around
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
and
highly
recommended
the
taste
has
a
slight
fruity
taste
from
the
yeast
with
mild
chalky
mineral
essence
and
semihigh
roastiness
with
no
real
bitter
burnt
flavor
just
nutty
and
almost
bready
malt
with
mild
creamy
and
raisiny
taste
in
the
back
with
some
light
bitterness
and
gentle
woody
earthy
character
as
it
finishes
dry
this
is
a
great
beer
which
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
with
appropriate
abv
and
dry
texture
and
plenty
of
flavor
considering
the
low
abv
i
would
order
this
over
guinness
since
it
seems
fresher
in
taste
not
bad
definitely
a
dry
stout
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
i
prefer
my
own
homebrewed
version
o
i
have
others
in
this
style
i
think
i
like
better
for
those
that
love
brooklyn
brewery
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
standout
overall
im
not
terribly
impressed
with
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
the
off
flavors
get
to
be
a
little
much
with
guinness
and
murphys
readily
available
along
with
oharas
i
cant
see
any
reason
to
pick
this
up
again
it
doesnt
really
stack
up
to
the
irish
offerings
o
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
one
but
its
not
bad
not
a
bad
option
if
you
are
looking
for
a
stout
on
the
lighter
side
m
this
feels
like
it
has
more
carbonation
than
most
dry
stouts
ive
tried
other
than
that
it
has
a
typical
light
airy
feel
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
quite
the
roasty
and
toasty
stout
the
dry
tone
doesnt
really
show
up
until
the
back
end
but
the
roasted
character
really
overshadows
everything
else
but
not
in
too
obnoxious
a
fashion
easy
to
drink
and
consistent
nice
session
beer
though
i
think
it
leans
more
towards
american
stout
than
a
dry
irish
one
overall
damn
i
am
not
sure
why
i
havent
found
this
around
pa
but
this
is
a
great
session
stout
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
really
filled
my
craving
for
a
stout
overall
a
solid
dry
irish
stout
a
nice
simple
dry
stout
good
flavors
not
grainy
or
watery
i
dig
that
it
is
under
5abv
o
super
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
with
well
hidden
alcohol
very
light
in
the
mouthfeel
not
overly
complex
in
smell
or
taste
but
this
one
would
be
great
on
nitro
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
it
is
quite
creamy
o
i
nice
if
not
very
special
nothing
really
jumps
out
its
very
unassuming
but
its
not
bad
in
any
way
refreshing
and
a
nice
session
stout
feel
to
it
deep
roasted
malts
up
front
sweet
dark
chocolate
coffee
slight
burnt
toast
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
leafyearthy
faint
dark
fruit
towards
the
finish
body
is
medium
slight
silky
mouthfeel
a
little
lively
carbonated
very
smooth
the
feel
is
a
letdown
and
im
not
saying
the
beer
has
to
have
that
creamy
nitro
guinness
thing
going
on
this
ones
still
just
a
little
too
coarse
doesnt
offer
much
else
in
flavor
other
than
dry
roast
and
coffee
and
earthy
tones
and
is
just
too
faulty
with
attenuation
and
blandness
its
definitely
not
standing
up
to
the
blue
chevre
im
eating
lets
hope
it
cools
down
and
pairs
well
with
a
dinner
of
mushroomswiss
burgers
and
onion
rings
guinness
clone
only
that
guinness
is
better
its
so
very
garret
oliver
big
on
fancy
talk
and
small
on
flavor
o
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
very
complex
aroma
or
taste
but
its
extremely
sessionable
i
would
imagine
that
this
would
taste
even
better
on
a
nitrotap
somehow
this
beer
seems
funnier
after
having
just
watched
gangs
of
new
york
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
coffee
roasted
malts
and
a
twinge
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
focusing
on
the
coffee
darkening
the
roast
of
the
malts
and
adding
a
hint
of
cola
in
the
background
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
surprisingly
watery
feel
overall
a
decent
little
irish
stout
but
one
thats
way
too
thin
for
its
own
good
and
not
creamy
enough
for
mine
overall
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
but
compared
to
guinness
its
very
good
compared
to
american
style
stouts
its
pretty
weak
and
bland
but
for
4
7
abv
this
is
a
solid
dark
session
beer
which
seems
to
be
the
point
of
the
irish
dry
stout
with
some
good
roasted
flavors
in
there
not
a
bad
pick
if
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
beer
on
the
roasteddark
side
of
things
taste
is
definitely
drier
than
it
smells
the
roast
is
bigger
too
bitterness
goes
a
long
way
on
the
finish
body
is
thin
but
not
overly
for
the
style
pretty
simple
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
mostly
just
roasty
malt
with
a
slight
sour
twinge
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
mediocre
offering
in
an
already
mediocre
style
category
glad
i
bought
a
single
instead
of
a
whole
sixer
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
dry
stout
this
has
more
flavor
than
a
guinness
though
it
may
not
be
as
traditional
this
one
has
plenty
of
what
i
consider
americanized
characteristics
such
as
the
faint
coffee
notes
caramel
and
sugary
aspects
traditionally
right
or
wrong
im
not
sure
i
expect
this
style
to
be
smoother
with
a
more
chocolaty
creamy
smooth
and
roasty
overall
though
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
choices
in
the
style
had
i
bought
the
rest
of
the
6pack
i
could
have
downed
them
all
tonight
yes
this
was
that
light
and
this
didnt
remind
me
of
beer
at
all
while
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
i
wish
that
there
was
more
of
a
creamy
and
toffeelike
tone
to
this
just
to
make
it
stand
out
a
bit
more
the
east
kent
golding
hops
may
have
lent
just
a
bit
of
grassy
bite
to
this
but
its
not
enough
and
this
needed
a
signature
flavor
to
make
it
stand
out
just
a
bit
above
the
level
of
ordinary
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
half
finger
beige
colored
head
that
held
pretty
well
aromas
consisted
mainly
of
coffee
and
earth
with
mild
bitter
chocolate
a
fuller
nice
feel
in
the
mouthpretty
smooth
dry
and
roasted
on
the
palate
as
it
should
bedark
roast
coffeeunsweetened
chocolateand
earthiness
mainly
stood
out
a
no
frills
but
pretty
true
to
form
irish
stouti
would
drink
again
taste
is
smooth
and
almost
smoky
with
more
of
the
charred
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
at
the
finish
pretty
tasty
and
welldone
and
more
than
sessionable
at
only
4
7
percent
abv
if
you
want
a
good
stout
look
elsewhere
the
brooklyn
dark
chocolate
stout
is
excellent
albeit
in
a
different
category
there
is
no
reason
this
brewer
cannot
make
a
really
first
class
dry
stout
this
would
be
a
fun
beer
to
serve
at
a
st
patricks
day
celebration
overall
very
drinkable
everyday
irish
stout
enjoyable
but
doesnt
stand
out
overall
not
bad
im
actually
happy
have
a
readily
available
dry
stout
in
bottles
that
isnt
nitrogen
infused
o
a
nice
dry
irish
stout
a
good
session
beer
with
good
balance
tastedark
roasted

subtle
hop
note
leads
to
a

good
flavor
and
character
throughout
a
fine
session
stout
looked
great
from
the
pour
into
a
pint
glass
dark
black
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
strong
smell
of
coffee
taste
the
coffee
as
well
but
weak
compared
to
smell
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
as
well
as
carbonation
its
a
good
brew
but
not
one
that
makes
my
top
ten
ill
offer
this
to
those
that
believe
guiness
is
too
heavy
pretty
thin
on
flavor
and
rather
watery
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
d
certainly
a
good
example
nitro
would
put
it
over
the
top
if
looking
for
roast
and
a
super
dry
stout
check
this
out
o
a
decent
beer
that
ill
have
again
overall
not
bad
decent
malt
profile
but
gets
slightly
burnt
acrid
nice
hop
addition
etc
o
it
hits
all
the
marks
for
the
style
but
it
still
comes
across
as
a
little
bland
the
foamy
mouthfeel
leaves
a
little
something
to
be
desired
the
packaging
and
its
gaudy
green
and
orange
coloring
should
help
sell
it
when
st
patricks
day
comes
around
but
theres
better
out
there
dry
finish
as
advertized
nice
new
offering
from
bklyn
d
a
sessionable
stout
but
rather
monotone
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
something
id
want
more
than
one
of
good
balance
dry
and
solid
hop
bitterness
a
great
beer
for
st
pattys
day
festivities
gotta
say
not
quite
how
i
expected
it
but
very
good
overall
for
a
bottled
irish
stout
all
in
all
this
offering
retains
key
qualities
of
the
style
but
adds
some
dimension
to
the
product
giving
it
more
depth
and
complexity
but
arguably
expertly
falling
short
of
stepping
out
of
bounds
hey
i
like
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
a
good
bit
of
chocolate
in
it
as
well
as
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
very
similar
there
is
a
ton
of
dry
cocoa
notes
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
roasted
malt
the
beer
is
very
dry
overall
thin
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
to
top
off
the
guinness
recreation
the
body
is
light
and
watery
with
little
aftertaste
effervescence
is
appropriate
and
well
done
but
that
and
lacing
alone
will
not
save
this
beer
if
i
wanted
a
pin
of
the
most
famous
stout
i
would
have
ordered
it
instead
this
needs
to
be
redone
an
ashy
note
does
show
up
in
the
aftertaste
slight
warming
as
well
not
bad
some
interesting
stuff
going
on
not
all
pleasant
cant
get
around
thinking
it
actually
has
some
hop
material
suspended
in
it
overall
it
had
some
nice
flavors
due
to
the
lighter
hop
and
more
cocoa
at
the
end
of
the
taste
which
did
it
well
but
the
body
was
a
little
on
the
low
side
overall
it
was
a
just
above
average
dry
irish
overall
more
flavorful
in
malt
and
hop
than
a
guinness
good
to
me
for
the
style
single
finger
head
on
a
jet
black
body
with
decent
lacing
aroma
is
mild
with
roasted
malt
mild
licorice
and
chocolate
note
flavor
is
fairy
watery
with
mostly
roasted
malt
and
light
earthy
and
chocolate
notes
light
bodies
and
moderate
carbonation
not
my
favorite
genre
as
most
are
usually
pretty
simple
this
one
is
definitely
highly
drinkable
an
excellent
session
ale
found
on
tap
at
mad
mex
robinson
pours
a
pitch
black
body
with
a
light
khaki
tan
airy
head
fluffy
texture
forming
everlasting
head
that
has
great
retention
aroma
kicks
up
mild
herbal
earthy
mint
like
hop
edge
amongst
the
dark
roasted
malts
creamy
textured
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
but
remains
pleasantly
roasty
with
malt
character
i
noticed
a
non
nitro
tap
which
was
a
plus
and
actually
brought
out
more
character
in
this
beer
dark
roasted
malts
bring
ample
bitterness
a
touch
of
tea
like
leafy
earthiness
going
on
as
well
but
a
semi
sweet
multidimensional
malt
complexity
comes
forth
with
each
sip
hints
of
creaminess
dark
chocolate
roasts
in
a
light
stout
form
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
nothing
cloying
or
harsh
on
the
palate
very
approachable
beer
to
drink
in
number
overall
im
happy
to
see
brooklyn
putting
out
a
stout
other
than
black
ops
or
their
chocolate
stout
this
was
pure
brilliance
d
quite
drinkable
and
well
made
not
complex
but
enjoyable
had
a
glass
at
top
hops
in
les
ah
a
nicely
balanced
irish
stout
theres
a
pleasing
bitter
tang
in
the
finish
with
smooth
mocha
grains
up
front
its
like
a
slightly
bigger
version
of
beamish
the
body
isnt
light
but
its
on
that
side
of
medium
and
creamy
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
pints
tasty
stout
find
it
if
you
can
o
this
was
just
an
average
brew
to
me
i
just
didnt
get
a
depth
of
flavor
i
was
expecting
it
is
not
by
any
means
bad
but
i
would
not
reach
for
another
certainly
worth
a
try
o
overall
a
decent
beer
from
brooklyn
nose
and
taste
have
some
light
coffee
and
a
lot
ofroasted
malts
nothing
great
really
jumping
out
in
either
very
nice
body
but
otherwise
a
pretty
standard
irish
dry
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
oone
of
the
better
irish
stouts
ive
had
it
is
a
style
im
not
too
fond
of
but
brooklyn
seems
to
have
made
a
good
one
o
had
this
one
on
st
paddys
day
a
perfect
day
for
a
beer
like
this
at
3
9
this
is
a
remarkably
flavorful
stout
it
goes
without
saying
that
oharas
and
yards
have
much
better
offerings
in
the
philly
area
honestly
id
much
prefer
a
guinness
extra
stout
next
time
or
even
a
donnybrook
or
sly
fox
version
of
the
irish
stout
though
theyre
half
the
strength
overall
a
very
good
take
on
an
irish
dry
stout
very
impressive
taste
for
an
abv
lower
than
the
typical
mass
produced
light
beer
o
nicely
done
fullflavored
dry
meets
the
style
guidelines
just
about
perfectly
brooklyns
irish
dry
stout
is
a
great
and
characterful
ale
to
drink
while
clinging
mugs
with
pub
goers
on
the
greenest
holiday
without
worry
of
accessive
drunkenness
or
palate
fatigue
but
for
the
staunch
stout
lover
the
beer
is
going
to
seem
timid
and
lackluster
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
nearly
opaque
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
light
tan
head
a
good
start
strong
aroma
has
semisweet
chocolate
caramel
and
yeasty
tones
satisfying
flavor
is
only
subtly
smoky
but
has
good
coffee
chocolate
and
licorice
notes
plus
hints
of
caramel
and
is
that
horehound
whatever
texture
seems
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
but
is
still
decently
fizzy
overall
if
not
great
still
worthy
of
a
try
overall
this
was
pretty
average
for
the
style
i
feel
like
a
nitro
tap
would
improve
this
beer
overall
so
much
id
gladly
take
this
over
guiness
slightly
more
flavor
and
body
but
really
not
something
i
would
buy
again
overall
this
bottle
has
a
few
years
in
it
but
it
still
drinks
nicely
the
mouthfeel
would
need
to
be
a
bit
better
to
take
the
rating
up
to
the
next
level
this
was
a
nice
desert
beer
after
eating
their
pollock
fish
and
chips
the
beer
packed
in
the
good
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
and
felt
relatively
light
yet
rich
and
smooth
going
down
the
hatch
very
delightful
very
drinkable
super
fantastic
and
super
drinkable
great
beer
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
low
profile
dense
offwhite
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
like
glue
smokey
and
coffee
roasted
aromas
which
smell
light
and
very
tasty
flavors
are
dry
and
smooth
with
roasted
coffee
and
a
slight
molasses
highlight
cloying
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
pleasant
and
rich
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
cleaning
the
palate
very
tasty
brew
overall
not
your
typical
irish
dry
stout
i
would
place
it
as
an
american
stout
the
beer
needs
to
be
a
little
more
roasty
and
creamy
to
be
a
good
irish
dry
stout
i
enjoyed
the
oppurtunity
of
tasting
this
beer
and
it
was
the
first
beer
i
have
tried
by
portsmouth
overall
carbonation
overkill
bad
bottle
maybe
although
others
tried
it
in
our
tasting
group
the
same
time
as
i
did
just
not
one
that
would
bring
me
back
again
too
many
other
better
stouts
out
there
and
more
easily
available
a
nice
beer
first
portsmouth
beer
enjoyed
a
lot
moreas
it
warmed
thanks
mikeyv35
very
drinkable
and
tasty
a
good
example
of
a
traditional
stout
went
well
with
the
pulled
pork
sandwich
loved
it
try
it
if
youre
drinking
in
portsmouth
then
i
couldnt
speak
more
highly
of
the
portsmouth
brewery
the
imperial
stout
is
great
and
so
is
the
bottle
rocket
ipa
very
good
stout
o
overall
this
beer
is
to
beer
what
baileys
is
to
booze
it
is
pretty
light
and
has
a
nice
irish
cream
thing
going
on
mostly
char
and
roastiness
with
some
subtle
notes
of
coffee
and
a
nice
presence
of
powdered
chocolate
this
beer
is
totally
hitting
the
spot
right
now
overall
probably
the
best
dry
stout
ive
had
which
is
not
that
many
since
they
seem
to
be
hard
to
come
by
in
the
craft
world
o
enjoyable
i
really
am
a
fan
of
the
irish
dry
stout
so
this
was
hit
home
for
me
that
said
ive
had
better
but
still
i
enjoyed
it
for
the
most
part
o
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
the
care
they
put
into
their
everyday
beer
is
very
apparent
send
more
jax
o
overall
this
is
quite
the
irish
dry
stout
nice
and
creamy
really
good
appearance
and
smell
a
solid
brew
from
portsmouth
o
goes
down
easily
ridiculously
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
and
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
phenomenal
drinking
irish
dry
stout
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
of
the
style
that
ive
had
yea
i
could
get
with
this
one
all
day
every
day
pours
a
respectably
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thinnish
tan
head
that
i
had
to
coax
with
a
vigorous
pour
roasted
coffee
and
caramel
fill
my
nostrils
along
with
powdered
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
toffee
taste
is
roasty
and
creamy
almost
like
a
sweet
stout
rather
than
a
dry
chocolate
and
coffee
mixed
with
caramel
and
toffee
longer
lingering
roasted
coffee
bitterness
mixed
with
just
enough
sweetness
finishes
every
sip
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
another
great
brew
from
the
folks
up
at
the
portsmouth
brewery
that
said
ill
withhold
judgment
on
the
debate
between
cat
and
kate
id
rather
have
both
ooverall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
very
drinkable
and
very
pleasing
to
all
the
senses
overall
i
think
this
beer
fits
the
style
very
well
would
purchase
this
again
at
the
brewery
to
take
home
or
have
a
pint
if
i
was
ever
driving
through
portsmouth
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
would
recommend
it
to
anybody
this
is
as
good
as
they
come
in
my
opinion
easy
drinking
and
oh
so
smooth
dont
get
me
wrong
when
it
comes
to
portsmouth
kate
the
great
is
where
its
at
but
dont
turn
your
nose
up
to
their
other
offerings
because
they
are
just
as
good
i
believe
this
is
my
sixth
or
seventh
bottle
from
these
guys
and
i
have
yet
to
have
on
that
was
bad
or
off
flavored
so
again
i
say
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
or
trade
for
one
tonights
beers
this
is
a
no
brainer
and
sure
win
in
the
flavor
category
o
unbelievably
easy
to
drink
calm
and
smooth
this
is
really
something
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
an
irish
dry
stout
ive
never
finished
a
bomber
so
fast
wow
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
pours
a
near
pitch
black
brown
with
a
faint
tan
head
that
fades
into
an
offwhite
ring
big
roasted
malt
coffee
milk
chocolate
aroma
very
faint
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
a
big
roasted
malt
profile
with
loads
of
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
finishes
with
a
leafyherbal
hop
bite
creamy
smooth
and
silky
mouth
feel
dangerously
drinkable
so
i
am
in
new
hampshire
for
the
great
bay
half
marathon
its
the
night
before
a
race
and
why
not
drink
some
ok
alot
of
the
local
beer
here
kitty
kitty
kitty
the
black
cat
stout
from
portsmouth
is
good
this
beer
has
was
darkblack
in
color
with
thin
ecru
head
and
great
lace
the
smell
has
a
subtle
roast
coffee
nose
the
smell
funnels
into
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
reasonable
abv
leads
to
this
beer
being
a
session
certainly
worth
a
taste
cask
beers
always
deliver
a
wonderfully
smooth
mouthfeel
and
this
one
was
no
different
in
particular
this
was
a
bit
chewy
and
full
bodied
too
overall
ive
always
enjoyed
this
stout
because
it
really
is
a
more
flavorful
version
of
guinness
andor
murphys
but
the
cask
and
dry
hopping
really
take
this
one
up
a
notch
keep
up
the
good
work
portsmouth
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
the
nitro
delivery
was
not
100
it
was
clearly
a
blend
of
beer
gas
nitroc02
because
the
initial
pour
and
head
formation
was
short
lived
overall
easy
drinking
and
not
bad
in
the
dry
stout
category
this
is
among
the
better
ones
ive
had
while
this
didnt
quite
come
off
as
a
traditional
dry
irish
stout
to
me
this
definitely
packed
some
quality
full
flavors
and
a
well
balanced
feel
into
its
easy
drinking
sub
6
package
i
could
have
easily
had
a
couple
of
these
i
believe
that
this
is
usually
their
staple
dark
beer
here
and
its
a
good
one
to
have
around
d
under
6
good
enough
for
me
my
irish
dry
stout
on
st
patricks
day
first
review
under
the
guidance
of
a
great
beer
connoiseur
bomber
bottle
from
the
brewery
cocoa
powder
taste
not
too
sweet
has
a
bite
to
it
not
too
bad
for
an
irish
stout
thank
you
a
korsak
for
my
grandchildren
and
for
the
awesome
beer
mentoring
115
ill
never
catch
afksports
overall
not
that
impressive
of
a
beer
but
i
may
just
not
like
irish
dry
stouts
drink
is
decent
creamy
and
smooth
no
bad
flavors
could
have
used
a
bit
more
dryness
on
the
finish
and
i
would
like
to
try
it
without
the
nitro
the
more
i
drink
the
more
some
earthy
and
a
little
herbal
hop
flavors
come
out
and
start
to
interfere
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
a
bit
but
thats
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
next
time
ill
opt
for
the
growler
instead
of
a
bottle
it
goes
down
that
well
id
also
want
to
save
some
to
cook
with
d
i
recall
having
this
at
kate
day
earlier
this
year
and
really
enjoying
it
however
revisiting
it
in
bottle
form
has
been
a
revelation
this
is
another
very
solid
beer
from
portsmouth
feel
is
perfect
and
drinks
much
bigger
than
its
abv
suggests
really
good
and
worth
seeking
out
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
decent
but
not
great
it
was
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
overall
but
not
too
bad
enjoyable
beer
overall
thin
mouthfeel
that
goes
along
with
the
dryness
this
is
a
stout
i
can
drink
all
night
it
may
even
be
a
good
summer
stout
with
the
roastiness
and
thin
body
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
a
pretty
decent
dry
stout
easy
drinking
nice
flavors
good
stuff
d
as
drinkable
as
a
5
stout
can
be
the
feel
really
leaves
you
longing
for
another
sip
this
is
by
far
the
best
dry
stout
ive
ever
had
the
chance
to
drink
been
all
over
great
britain
and
the
us
drinking
stouts
and
this
is
the
best
dry
stout
imho
drinkability
finishes
much
easier
than
stouts
im
used
to
this
beer
paired
really
well
with
my
haddock
they
complimented
each
other
nicely
rather
than
got
in
one
anothers
way
would
absolutely
try
again
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
my
first
offering
from
the
portsmouth
brewery
i
picked
up
a
bomber
to
bring
home
as
a
side
note
if
you
want
to
make
the
staff
at
portsmouth
brewery
laugh
just
ask
if
they
have
any
kate

major
skunked
bottle
the
first
time
i
tried
this
this
is
a
really
good
stout
creamy
lots
of
malts
slightly
dry
some
coffee
and
bittering
chocolate
flavors
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
a
keeper
for
sure
major
upgrade
from
my
original
ranking
of
b
d
if
i
were
in
a
chugging
contest
it
would
get
a
5
however
i
am
not
i
was
pretty
dissapointed
in
this
stout
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
in
the
future

a

in

then
any
irish
stout
i
can
remember
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
if
you
are
a
fan
of
uncle
arthur
this
a
nice
similar
stout
less
creamy
more
bitterness
im
not
sure
which
would
be
considered
more
drinkable
but
this
is
worth
a
shot
to
see
what
you
think
thanks
to
kelp
for
hooking
me
up
on
this
one
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
poured
forth
the
color
of
cappuccino
with
a
small
brown
head
that
went
away
slowly
smells
like
coffee
smoke
and
cocoa
the
taste
is
probably
what
guinness
would
beif
it
didnt
taste
like
bog
water
and
chocolate
syrup
all
the
smells
com
through
in
the
taste
and
it
ends
with
a
nice
smokiness
too
it
and
coffee
lingers
on
the
tongue
it
feels
silky
and
creamy
and
ends
with
an
enjoyable
bitterness
on
my
tongue
that
made
me
wait
longer
than
usual
to
have
another
sip
i
actually
wanted
more
of
this
brew
once
i
had
finished
the
bottle
which
for
me
is
a
lot
to
say
since
i
tend
to
go
from
one
beer
to
another
when
i
drink
and
this
was
22oz
to
boot
i
do
wonder
how
much
nicer
this
would
have
been
straight
from
the
tap
though
i
had
this
on
tap
at
portsmouth
brewery
on
101609
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
beautiful
cascading
nitrogenation
leaves
a
two
finger
tan
head
on
top
of
a
black
body
head
dies
away
slowly
to
leave
very
thin
head
lacing
is
more
like
sheeting
big
nose
of
roasted
malt
slightly
acrid
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
more
of
the
same
on
the
tongue
with
a
complex
dry
finish
medium
bodied
and
infinately
smooth
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
an
extremely
sessionable
stout
very
much
enjoyed
goes
down
quickly
i
want
to
down
this
stuff
quickly
but
better
discretion
limits
the
possibilities
nothing
against
guinness
it
serves
a
purpose
but
if
you
could
have
this
on
tap
why
would
you
even
consider
anything
else
extremely
wellconstructed
a
fine
example
of
an
irish
dry
stout
d
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
good
drinkability
on
this
as
well
but
i
tend
to
use
it
as
a
session
closer
more
than
a
session
brew
drinkability
was
pretty
high
for
a
stout
not
as
thin
as
a
beamish
or
murphys
but
delicious
enough
to
have
multiple
d
low
abv
and
otherwise
great
tastes
make
this
an
excellent
session
beer
pours
jet
black
on
the
thinner
side
of
stouts
not
a
ton
of
head
or
lacing
ordinary
in
appearance
smells
pretty
hoppy
and
kind
of
harsh
like
sharp
spicy
bitter
chocolate
taste
is
great
though
and
very
smooth
lots
of
rich
chocolatey
flavours
some
nice
roastiness
blending
together
to
something
that
is
fairly
creamy
and
surprisingly
light
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
not
boozey
at
all
nor
is
it
overly
hoppy
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
sweet
session
stout
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
smallish
tan
head
the
smell
is
pungent
with
coffeechocolateand
roasted
malt
the
taste
has
a
full
flavor
with
roasted
maltcoffeeand
chocolate
a
pretty
good
tasting
stout
the
mf
is
light
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
a
very
good
stout
from
a
very
good
brewery
overall
this
was
like
kates
little
sister
for
me
rich
smooth
decadent
and
slightly
dry
this
was
a
nice
lighter
stout
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
would
have
no
issue
at
all
going
back
to
another
day
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
big
round
body
delicious
beer
d
ever
so
easy
such
a
sessionable
brew
that
could
be
an
everyday
drinking
pending
its
availability
of
course
great
beer
from
portsmouth
id
seek
this
out
especially
for
fans
of
oharas
irish
stout
although
the
aroma
of
this
beer
was
really
terrific
both
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
were
disappointing
i
would
opt
for
any
nitrogen
infused
irish
dry
stout
over
this
drinkability
man
this
stuff
is
tasty
its
got
this
sort
of
half
semisweet
half
semibitter
thing
that
im
totally
digging
its
got
a
beautiful
finish
that
is
dry
and
ohsodelicious
big
thanks
for
sharing
adam
d
ive
never
tasted
anything
quite
like
this
very
tasty
thanks
joepais
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
dry
stout
and
very
sessionable
theres
nothing
like
getting
something
than
from
its
source
the
brewpub
in
portsmouth
as
we
sat
down
i
noticed
a
gentleman
sipping
a
dark
stout
along
with
mussels
while
i
opted
for
the
fantastic
ploughmans
platter
i
went
for
the
stout
eagerly
as
well
the
pint
gave
looking
perfectly
poured
black
with
a
wonderful
beige
with
hints
of
orange
head
that
stayed
throughout
the
quaff
roasted
malt
coffee
aroma
lent
to
a
full
flavor
that
tasted
like
a
nice
thick
bitter
porter
with
slight
licorice
hints
and
then
i
had
another
i
could
drink
this
black
beauty
all
night
once
you
go
black
you
never
go
back
pours
a
deep
dark
onyx
black
with
a
thin
one
finger
light
brown
colored
head
a
fair
amount
of
spotty
lacing
remains
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
consists
of
smokey
malts
roasted
barley
and
faint
citrus
hops
underneath
some
coffee
and
chocolate
linger
in
the
nose
as
well
i
really
really
like
the
aroma
of
this
stout
taste
begins
with
milk
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
some
caramel
mocha
coffee
flavors
emerge
midway
with
a
touch
of
lactose
and
vanilla
some
earthy
and
floral
hops
tickle
the
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
with
faint
cocoa
powder
as
well
light
and
creamy
body
with
a
smooth
texture
from
the
soft
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
lots
of
flavor
and
low
abv
at
4
5
is
a
perfect
session
beer
i
really
wish
more
breweries
would
produce
this
style
i
like
this
beer
alot
and
its
even
better
on
cask
another
winner
from
portsmouth
tap
the
brewery
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
though
it
could
be
because
i
had
it
alongside
the
portsmouth
kate
black
pour
with
no
head
lighter
aroma
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
more
chocolate
and
sweetness
than
expected
good
hop
bite
in
the
back
very
good
drinkability
top
notch
the
kicker
here
is
the
taste
not
overpowering
but
extremely
enjoyable
true
to
its
style
yet
very
unique
wish
i
had
another
one
of
these
but
oh
well
guess
ill
have
to
make
another
trade
oakes
bottle
damn
good
for
its
style
this
one
the
smell
of
chocolate
a
bit
of
smoke
lighter
mouthfeel
quite
nice
chocolate
and
roasty
flavour
held
up
well
enough
after
room
temperature
that
i
finished
another
good
sized
sample
then
black
nothing
special
on
head
had
this
ontap
at
the
brewpub
in
portsmouth
poured
black
with
a
beautiful
head
that
is
satiny
smooth
with
very
tight
bubbles
great
very
fine
lacing
smells
roasty
and
creamy
with
an
undernote
of
espresso
tastes
roasty
as
well
followed
by
a
slight
nuttiness
the
slightly
startling
and
faint
flavor
of
oyster
liquor
and
a
creamy
finish
the
oyster
flavor
im
referring
to
is
a
brash
brininess
with
a
metallic
tang
and
is
evocative
of
the
sea
mouthfeel
is
extremely
creamy
and
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
quite
a
complex
irish
dry
stout
particularly
for
such
a
low
abv
i
picked
this
up
at
the
brewery
along
with
a
bottle
of
le
chat
noir
in
order
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
the
beer
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
slowly
retreats
to
a
thin
layer
the
aroma
is
dry
roasted
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
with
almost
a
milk
like
quality
there
is
plenty
of
burnt
chocolatey
and
roasty
flavor
to
balance
the
sweetness
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
stout
although
it
may
be
trumped
by
their
oatmeal
stout
taste
is
primarily
roasted
malt
with
a
decent
smokiness
to
it
not
creamy
and
seems
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
overall
though
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurt
this
beer
not
sure
if
this
is
the
way
its
meant
to
be
presented
but
it
meant
ive
had
much
better
stouts
dvery
true
to
the
irish
dry
stout
tradition
probably
too
filling
to
drink
alot
of
but
certainly
tasty
enough
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
especially
with
the
low
abv
had
i
not
wanted
to
sample
more
of
their
offerings
i
could
have
easily
sat
at
the
bar
and
knocked
several
of
these
back
given
that
it
was
a
raw
rainy
cold
and
windy
night
on
the
nh
coast
looks
very
nice
smells
very
nice
just
needs
to
grow
up
more
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
beer
i
had
out
in
oregon
called
the
terminator
just
without
balls
if
all
the
flavors
were
kicked
up
this
would
be
very
enjoyable
but
as
is
its
kind
of
boring
i
might
give
it
another
shot

bleak

that
is

is
sort
of
hard
to
write
about
its
good
its
nice
its
a
stout
theres
not
much
else
to
say
about
it
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
just
a
classic
representation
of
what
a
stout
should
be
it
has
some
nice
bitter
coffee
notes
in
the
nose
and
drinks
clean
dark
and
balanced
with
almost
a
hint
of
cola
it
finishes
with
some
nice
dark
chocolate
also
if
youre
looking
for
a
new
experience
this
isnt
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
stout
that
wont
dissapoint
then
take
a
ride
with
the
black
cat
pours
a
light
black
almost
dark
brown
or
a
burnt
brown
and
leaves
a
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
espresso
soft
cinnamon
nutmeg
the
taste
on
the
palate
is
some
what
watery
which
is
how
the
mouth
feel
is
suppose
to
be
more
of
a
smooth
sipping
stout
the
body
gives
you
a
quick
taste
of
coffee
followed
by
some
astringent
smokey
hop
bitterness
but
quickly
dissapates
leaving
you
somewhat
waiting
for
more
flavor
the
black
cat
stout
was
my
last
remaining
bomber
from
a
recent
trip
to
the
portsmouth
area
i
was
sad
to
see
it
go
because
i
enjoyed
all
of
them
so
much
but
i
certainly
wasnt
sad
to
do
the
drinking
it
pours
into
my
glass
pitch
black
with
no
light
penetration
a
thin
tan
head
forms
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
strong
full
of
a
roasted
malt
element
perfect
for
the
style
the
taste
follows
in
this
vein
a
very
nice
roastiness
comes
in
providing
a
very
different
bitterness
than
im
used
to
drinking
so
many
ipas
there
seems
to
be
a
subtle
chocolate
note
in
the
background
it
finishes
very
dry
with
an
added
kick
of
roasted
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
does
seem
to
become
a
bit
light
towards
the
finish
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
stout
that
exemplifies
the
style
theres
nothing
in
it
that
tries
to
set
it
apart
from
its
peers
it
succeeds
in
doing
this
by
just
being
a
very
very
solid
example
of
the
style
no
gimmicks
really
liked
this
beer
the
flavor
was
more
of
a
roasty
than
a
toasty
or
overly
so
very
creamy
body
that
was
served
at
the
perfect
temperature
poured
a
very
black
in
color
with
a
slight
brown
head
very
thick
too
with
bulbouslike
lace
picked
up
some
slight
coffee
and
vanilla
on
the
palate
not
acidic
at
all
like
some
other
dry
irish
stouts
nose
was
mostly
stale
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
it
paired
well
with
my
fried
seafood
appitizer
would
have
gone
equally
well
with
dessert
or
as
dessert
or
with
oysters
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
actually
it
got
a
little
too
sweet
and
syrupy
for
me
toward
the
end
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
home
i
would
have
tried
something
else
this
is
one
solid
stout
the
black
cat
stout
is
well
crafted
and
made
with
quality
wish
i
could
find
this
in
stores
around
me
check
it
out
if
you
have
the
chance
a
fantastic
session
stout
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
mediumheavy
in
body
the
finish
is
long
on
the
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
tones
after
swallowing
another
outstanding
beer
at
portsmouth
its
almost
a
meal
in
itself
deep
black
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
light
lace
after
i
drink
the
nose
has
a
ton
of
roast
malt
that
gives
off
a
little
chocolate
and
maybe
licorice
the
taste
has
a
dominant
roast
malt
flavor
some
of
the
licorice
comes
through
in
the
flavor
along
wit
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
and
some
floral
hop
flavor
very
dry
in
character
with
a
mildly
slick
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
beer
full
bodied
smooth
and
just
a
touch
sour
nicely
offsets
all
the
sweetness
that
would
otherwise
be
there
they
should
add
a
beer
engine
to
their
setup
and
run
this
one
off
cask
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
bombers
from
the
store
to
bring
home
both
the
beers
i
tried
at
this
place
were
really
good
im
going
to
have
to
make
a
special
trip
up
here
to
try
some
of
the
others
or
beg
and
plead
these
guys
to
roll
some
kegs
into
the
blind
tiger
my
wife
actually
had
this
offering
before
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
and
she
even
liked
this
onepours
a
pitch
black
with
a
great
creamysticky
head
aroma
is
roasted
to
the
hilt
along
with
some
sweetend
chocolate
hints
taste
is
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
marshmellow
quality
about
ita
very
enjoyable
beer
to
savor
the
different
flavors
of
this
one
cheers
update
they
do
bottle
this
must
be
cold
in
hell

this
is
a
flavorful
remnant
of
my
saint
patricks
day
beers
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
guinness
it
appeases
the
senses
more
than
guinness
overall
the
craft
and
flavors
are
good
but
its
slightly
slate
missing
some
freshness
too
dry
and
bitter
for
my
taste
preferring
sweeter
stouts
enjoy
slainte
o
im
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
what
but
the
smokiness
on
the
taste
was
really
overwhelming
for
me
it
could
be
compared
to
the
peaty
smokiness
of
a
lagavulin
scotch
not
the
creamy
and
subtle
stout
i
was
expecting
besides
the
taste
everything
else
was
a1
definitely
will
try
in
the
future
to
see
if
the
extreme
smoke
flavours
are
a
commonality
great
example
a
lot
better
than
d
bould
guinness
very
good
the
hops
are
very
well
handled
the
bitter
and
the
burnt
about
as
good
as
it
gets
delicious
i
will
buy
more
in
the
near
future
roasty
chocolatey
with
a
touch
of
char
at
the
finish
theres
a
touch
of
diacetyl
but
a
solid
beer
hints
of
coffee
if
oharas
were
as
ubiquitous
as
guinness
wed
all
have
a
better
quality
of
life
this
stout
leaves
no
room
for
want
its
as
wellcrafted
a
textbook
example
as
they
come
any
pub
that
regularly
offered
this
would
have
my
patronship
and
fullfledged
allegiance
its
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
drink
with
unconditional
regularity
and
sorrowfully
wish
i
could
send
more
o
the
stout
flavours
are
present
and
tasty
but
are
marred
by
the
salty
taste
original
irish
stout
reference
for
the
style
not
sweet
and
very
assertive
on
roasted
flavors
this
is
how
an
irish
stout
should
be
high
drinkability
and
sure
better
than
guinness
overall
a
rich
and
roasty
stout
with
more
dank
and
earthy
flavours
than
many
in
the
style
however
very
enjoyable
as
so
often
this
style
goes
the
coffee
route
of
things
a
very
good
stout

grade

an
a
oharas
irish
stout
is
a
fantastic
example
of
a
quintessential
irish
session
stout
and
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
this
style
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
they
did
not
skimp
on
the
roasted
malts
as
this
light
stout
provides
far
more
roasty
chocolate
and
espresso
goodness
than
the
leading
irish
brand
could
ever
hope
to
muster
this
is
a
skilfullybrewed
beer
and
a
serious
crowdpleaser
you
dont
need
to
be
a
beer
geek
to
appreciate
this
one
session
stout
fans
should
consider
oharas

just
a

toasted
malty
flavor
had
a
somewhat
thin
consistency
definitely
thinner
than
what
id
expect
from
a
typical
irish
stout
very
drinkable
the
carbonation
is
actually
rather
pleasant
not
a
whole

of
bitterness
to
it
just
very
warm
hints
of
coffee
and
a
very
smooth
maltiness
definitely
worth
buying
this
kicks
the
crap
out
of
most
irish
dry
stouts
itll
never
be
my
favorite
style
but
id
get
this
one
again
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
a
nice
alternative
to
guinness
the
beer
was
a
little
lighter
than
you
might
expect
but
it
was
full
of
flavours
and
very
easy
going
down
definitely
a
beer
worth
getting
your
hands
on
overall
a
terrific
representation
of
a

wow
best

simply
superb
d
very

at

big
splotches
of

on

typical

aromas
of
cocoa
coffee
bean
cream

and
a
tart

to
finish
it
off
smooth

to
a

sharpness
smoke
espresso
and
bittersweet
chocolate
mediumlight
bodied
bitter
and
dry
in
the
finish
pretty
much
spoton
for
the
style
a
superdrinkable
dark
malty
beverage
that
is
a
great
showcase
for
roasted
barley
o
an
excellent
stout
that
ended
up
ranking
higher
than
i
first
thought
looks
great
and
its
delicious
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
o
not
fantastic
just
better
than
guinness
this
is
a
good
candidate
for
sessioning
it
certainly
beats
trying
to
write
a
review
on
this
because
frankly
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
to
talk
about
here
omy
benchmark
for
irish
stout
thus
far
great
flavor
and
balance
in
this
low
abv
beer
the
beer
is
pitch
black
with
hardly
any
dark
red
reflex
in
the
glass
thich
dark
resistent
foam
strong
smell
of
toasted
malts
and
cocoa
the
taste
is
surprisingly
strong
mainly
of
cocoa
while
alcohol
is
not
very
present
its
a
light
well
balanced
stout
it
feels
dense
i
believe
due
to
wheat
low
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
an
interesting
variation
to
good
old
guinness
o
a
decent
stout
still
more
interesting
than
guiness
id
say
the
flavor
is
slightly
less
complex
and
more
a
straightforward
dry
stout
than
another
dry
stout
offered
by
this
brewery
leann
follain
which
has
more
depth
to
it
and
i
have
to
say
is
a
little
better
but
this
is
enjoyable
there
are
a
few
more
of
these
on
the
list
but
i
doubt
i
like
anymany
of
them
oh
well
maybe
the
next
beer
will
leave
me
sockless
get
it
oharas
irish
stout
has
a
honestly
amazing
pour
it
pours
black
which
is
plenty
impressive
for
a
4
5
brew
but
the
mocha
head
is
huge
and
retains
for
an
eternity
one
of
the
best
looking
pours
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
the
aroma
is
a
roast
and
caramel
thing
with
just
a
touch
of
leafy
hops
the
taste
offers
a
nice
roast
flavor
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
and
the
leafy
hops
from
the
nose
a
pretty
decent
tasting
dry
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
and
well
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
oharas
is
a
good
irish
dry
stout
that
id
take
over
guinness
any
day
o
between
the
lighter
mouthfeel
low
abv
and
good
flavors
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
knocking
back
a
handful
of
these
in
an
afternoonevening
o
this
is
a
good
irish
dry
stout
if
it
were
more
available
id
take
it
over

for
taste

almost
opaque

dark

foamy

there
is
a
medium

on
the

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
nitro
presentation
isnt
doing
much
to
help
it
poured
on

and
served
in
a

is
a
brown
to

that
clings
to
everything

an

not

the

there
is
no
stopping
the
classic

intended
to
keep
you
up
all
night
singing
ontap
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
this
is
a
very
impressive
brew
to
my
palate
and
im
happy
i
finally
got
the
chance
to
try
it
i
had
its
big
brother
celebration
a
while
back
and
that
also
ruled
my
taste
buds
drink
up
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
theres
a
date
of

it
but
the
rest
is
rubbed
out
this

a
pitch
black

with
a
decent

which
has
good

the
smells
are
of
roasted

a
little
light
the
feel
is
medium
to
a
little
light
the
taste
is
good
enough
better
than
the
burnt

taste
you
get
some
mild
roasted
malts
not
bad

packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown

bottle
with
a

overall
drinkability
i
remember
the
first
time
i
had
this
many
years
ago
and
i
was
amazed
at
how
much
more
flavor
there
was
in
it
compared
to
guinness
now
having
it
again
many
years
later
im
still
impressed
but
i
think
ive
gotten
spoiled
by
those
nitrotaps
that
being
said
i
think
this
beer
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
a
little
less
carbonation
and
it
would
have
worked
better
still
a
very
good
stout
and
very
drinkable
i
had
it
by
itself
but
i
think
i
would
be
very
interested
in
having
it
again
with
a
meal
a
retro
interpretation
of
a
dry
irish
o
a
tasty
stout
that
delivers
some
solid
flavors
is
easily
drinkable
and
certainly
worth
a
try
glad
had
the
opportunity
to
take
this
for
a
spin
notes
dam
tasty
beer
all
the
way
through
a
good
one
to
pick
up
cheers
overall
full
flavored
irish
stout
has
the
body
an
mouthfeel
you
expect
very
drinkable
d
this
had
a
nice
scent
ok
taste
and
weak
body
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
not
anything
special
aside
from
being
irish
on
st
patricks
day
o
an
excellent
exemple
of
irish
dry
stout
quite
complex
well
balanced
and
with
a
good
drinkability
overall
one
of
the
better
irish
stouts
that
i
have
had
if
its
available
id
choose
it
over
guinness
or
murphys
any
day
worth
a
drink
especially
with
some
good

found
at
my
place
in
newtown
ct
this
stout
shows
a
pretty
much
opaque
black
color
with
a
crew
cut
firm
tan
head
full
of
soap
suds
sized
bubbles
and
healthy
caked
on
lacing
the
aroma
offers
classic
charcoal
malt
rlatively
mild
and
unspectacular
the
flavor
comes
on
with
smooth
charcoal
and
mild
vanilla
malt
with
a
touch
of
tropical
fruit
very
nice
and
such
an
unusually
creamy
feel
in
a
mediumplus
bodied
brew
there
is
a
mild
milk
chocolate
idea
here
highly
drinkable
stuff
the
most
notable
aspect
is
the
slightly
aqueous
creamy
texture
but
plenty
tasty
as
irish
stouts
go
an
easy
choice
though
nothing
too
out
of
the
ballpark
serving
type
nitrotap
o
good
stout
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
guinness
i
like
the
guinness
export
better
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
stout
and
its
about
as
close
to
perfect
as
can
be
for
an
irish
dry
stout
also
the
low
abv
is
a
delight
i
could
drink
this
for
hours
oh
my
i
may
have
found
an

glass
pours
black
with
a
two
finger
length
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavor
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
it
tastes
exactly
as
it
smells
the
hops
arent
veyr
prominent
and
the
taste
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
theres
a
pleasant
interplay
of
sweet
and
bitter
in
the
taste
and
this
stout
definitely
opens
up
as
it
warms
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lower
end
of
medium
and
its
crisp
this
drinks
fairly
easily
and
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
this
beer
its
very
good
poured
a
motor
oil
looking
type
body
with
a
huge
head
head
stuck
around
for
a
nice
while
and
left
tons
of
lacing
while
doing
so
smells
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
banana
and
vanilla
beans
taste
is
onque
with
the
smell
except
the
banana
and
other
fruits
really
tend
to
stick
out
vanilla
was
a
huge
hit
on
this
stout
and
i
say
this
because
the
sweet
aftertaste
couldnt
have
came
from
anything
else
however
it
might
just
be
the
specific
6
pack
i
came
across
but
there
is
something
funky
about
the
finish
of
this
beer
would
i
buy
again
naa
would
i
refuse
if
it
were
available
for
free
naa
o
a
solid
dry
stout
with
an
almost
unparalleled
drinkability
i
had
to
fight
to
keep
from
downing
the
entire
glass
long
enough
to
write
the
review
overall
just
a
little
too
thin
bodied
and
a
little
too
simple
for
my
taste
could
see
knocking
back
a
six
pack
of
these
though
rjt
pitch
black
with
a
tan
two
finger
head
roasted
malt
notes
dry
chocolate
flavor
with
a
hint
of
sourness
in
the
middle
very
carbonated
for
the
style
smooth
yet
does
have
a
mild
roast
bite
also
a
faint
hint
of
some
sweet
hops
respectable
and
i
would
have
again
no
problem
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
due
to
its
high
drinkability
oharas
stout
has
flagged
itself
in
one
of
the
top
irish
stout
list
in
my
mind
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
if
youre
planning
to
quaff
a
few
pints
sitting
down
for
the
beer
of
the
day
i
prefer
one
with
a
more
muscular
stance
that
slows
my
guzzling
down
a
bit
even
with
a
pint
the
glass
bottom
comes
up
all
too
quickly
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
however
ill
have
it
again
on
tap
and
not
from
the
bottle
this
is
worth
a
try
o
not
the
best
stout
that
ive
ever
had
but
far
from
the
worst
the
flavor
is
balanced
nice
and
bitter
without
overwhelming
the
4
3
alcohol
and
relatively
light
mouthfeel
make
this
if
not
sessionable
then
at
least
easy
and
quick
to
drink
still
a
really
good
irish
stout
better
than
the
biggest
d
not
my
favorite
style
by
a
longshot
but
on
my
list
of
styles
to
checkoff
very
easy
drinking
because
of
the
dryness
but
with
the
lack
of
body
it
is
not
the
most
enjoyable
brew
to
me
overall
definitely
a
fantastic
stout
that
is
a
must
try
for
fans
of
the
style
my
one
complain
would
be
that
the
price
is
a
little
high
at
least
it
is
where
i
live
still
it
was
worth
buying
to
try
and
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
someday
o
very
delightful
and
im
happy
to
give
props
to
a
microbrewery
from
gods
country
maybe
this
beer
appeals
to
a
broader
demographic
than
the
one
i
fit
into
but
they
were
willing
to
make
a
few
tweaks
this
could
become
a
beer
of
unrivaled
quality
o
its
hard
to
imagine
a
better
executed
dis
without
someone
truly
innovating
well
done
carlow
o
nice
stout
quite
sessionable
the
first
time
i
ever
had
this
beer
i
fell
in
love
i
was
new
to
beer
and
it
was
one
of
my
original
starter
beers
that
got
me
into
beer
with
flavor
a
few
years
later
i
bought
another
4
pack
and
it
just
wasnt
as
enjoyable
the
apperance
was
nice
and
black
like
a
true
irish
stout
the
smell
has
roastedness
and
very
enjoyable
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
bothered
me
at
first
it
was
delicious
and
then
it
turned
into
a
cigar
taste
the
taste
would
be
a
5
out
of
5
if
it
didnt
have
that
horrible
cigarette
cigar
taste
the
mouth
feel
was
nice
and
easy
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
one
little
thing
ruined
it
for
me
still
have
to
appreciate
all
the
good
points
of
the
beer
though
o
nicely
crafted
irish
stout
we
have
here
this
is
one
to
revisit
time
and
again
a
dry
lightly
roasted
malt
aftertaste
on
this
irish
dry
stout
a
pretty
good
beer
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
some
ice
cream
i
enjoy
stouts
like
this
with
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
in
back
in
the
day
we
called
them
guinness
floats
if
you
havent
and
you
enjoy
stoutsporters
you
should
definitely
try
one
o
this
is
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
but
ive
had
better
worth
checking
out
and
an
easy
drinker
i
dont
know
how
much
it
costs
because
it
was
left
at
my
house
but
i
may
pick
up
a
pack
or
two
sometime
wonderful
would
seek
out
again
overall
a
very
sessionable
stout
true
to
its
style
and
an
easy
sipper
instead
of
getting
a
guinness
i
wanted
to
try
an
oharas
they
look
pretty
much
the
same
both
are
black
in
color
with
a
great
looking
creamy
tan
nirto
chaged
head
the
smell
is
subtle
slightly
roasted
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
toasty
too
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thicker
than
a
guinness
overall
this
beer
a
pretty
good
in
my
opinion
i
enjoy
having
this
has
an
alternative
to
guinness
when
im
out
and
i
see
it
on
tap
a
must
try
for
ever
stout
lover
highly
recommended
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
dark

a
very
fine

smoky

is

and

burnt

texture
is

smooth
and
somewhat

recommended
to
all
stout
fans
o
most
everything
about
this
beer
is
excellent
save
for
the
nose
i
cant
think
of
an
example
of
the
style
with
a
particularly
fabulous
nose
though
so
even
that
is
not
much
of
a
detractor
dr
4
40
quid
is

this
beer
spits
on
my
favourite
style
all
ye
who
claim
this
is
better
than
guinness
are
either
playing
the
contrarian
or
too
involved
in
promoting
irish
craft
beer
over
macros
let
me
inform
you
guinness
is
not
the
man
a
bit
too
much
for
me
medium

am
comparing
this
to
the
guinness
we
get
here
and
it
really
is
blowing
it
away
huge
roasted

along
with
some
nicely
acidic
coffee
tones
really
smooth
in
body
a
bit
of
nutty
flavors
deep
in
there
chocolate
is
a
bit
weak
and
the
sweetness
really
never
comes
through
finish
is
dry
and
quick
making
this
an
easy
quaffer
i
could
drink
many
of
these
with
no

that
really
didnt

for

very
burnt
aroma
with
a
heaping
of
dark
dark
chocolate
and
milder
coffee
flavor
is
not
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
but
still
has
some
more
things
going
on
than
that
more
popular
though
still
good
global
irish
stout
flavor
is
rather
nutty
with
a
nice
toasted
grain
flavor
coming
through
to
balance
the
strong
chocolate
overtones
has
a
slightly
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
though
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
could
use
a
bit
more
body
nonetheless
a
great
irish
stout
one
that
i
wish
i
could
have
found
on
draught
whilst
i
was
in
ireland
pitch
black
hue
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
as
the
beer
settles
in
one
word
sums
up
the
aroma
roast
roasted
malts
dark
roasted
coffee
a
pleasant
nose
up
front
a
dark
coffee
bean
flavoring
roasted
malts
and
borderline
medium
in
the
body
some
nutty
flavoring
and
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
not
as
dry
as
expected
and
in
no
way
complex
in
the
flavoring
department
however
a
pretty
decent
stout
overall
a
reasonably
drinkable
stout
nothing
special
but
o
k
and
at
my
neighborhood
outlet
a
good
value
amongst
irish
stouts
drinkability
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
i
would
get
excited
about
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
difficultly
describing
it
due
to
this
beers
reserved
manner
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
stout
and
i
plan
on
purchasing
more
n
the
future
notes
did
a
trained
monkey
put
on
the
labels
a
pretty
decent
stout
dry
and
bitter
roasty
and
burnt
tastes
very
irish
i
fact
it
tastes
similar
to
the
mainstream
irish
stouts
but
with
a
touch
more
body
and
less
of
that
crappy
creamyness
decent
a
better
alternative
to
guinness
and
it
doesnt
have
the
crappy
nitro
creamyness
of
guinness
i
saw
that
oharas
got
good
reviews
in
all
about
beer
magazine
so
when
i
saw
this
one
in
the
store
i
thought
id
give
it
a
shot
although
this
is
certainly
a
good
brew
that
is
quite
drinkable
it
didnt
quite
make
me
jump
out
of
my
seat
with
a
smile
i
wont
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
but
im
not
running
to
stock
the
fridge
with
it
either
poured
an
opaque
black
with
a
hint
of
red
a
nice
tan
head
and
a
decent
clingy
lace
the
head
subdued
quite
quickly
but
maintained
a
fine
layer
the
aroma
was
roasted
malty
and
of
caramel
with
a
background
a
presence
of
fruit
the
flavor
starts
slightly
sweet
and
roasted
but
finishes
dry
and
with
a
lasting
bite
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
effervescent
but
a
little
thin
and
dry
admittedly
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
prefer
a
more
dynamic
brew
that
possesses
a
little
more
texture
and
body
a
damn
good
stout
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
black
as
night
with
a
long
lasting
head
aroma
is
chocolately
with
some
coffee
notes
taste
is
sweet
and
chocolately
with
a
dry
coffee
finish
the
finish
seems
a
bit
thin
its
still
a
good
find
for
stout
fans
though
jet

small
creamy
light

aroma
of
dark
roasted
coffee

medium

thin

flavors
with
a

the
finish
some
what
watery
not
all
that
great
i
dont
want
another
one
bottled
this
stout
poured
a
medium
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipated
and
it
had
smallmedium
bubbles
the
lacing
was
sparse
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
aroma
was
that
of
coffee
and
it
had
a
good
and
smooth
coffee
taste
that
i
enjoyed
there
was
an
aftertaste
to
this
particular
stout
that
lingered
this
brew
pours
a
medium
head
of
fine
creamy
light
brown
bubbles
that
leaves
a
fair
lacing
and
a
dark
opaque
black
brown
body
it
has
a
very
mild
malt
aroma
its
flavor
contains
notes
of
coffee
mild
chocolate
and
some
roast
it
has
s
lightly
smooth
start
with
a
lingering
mild
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
a
nice
example
of
a
stout
without
being
overly
impressive
with
the
coffee
flavors
this
is
a
most
impressive
beer
black
with
a
persistent
light
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
patches
of
lace
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
malt
chocolate
and
some
light
notes
of
coffee
with
a
touch
of
a
metallic
influence
flavor
is
very
balanced
with
a
light
sweetness
that
becomes
slightly
bitter
as
it
finishes
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
some
light
earthy
hops
complement
each
other
and
at
the
same
time
compete
for
your
attention
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
highly
recommended
overall
a
good
stout
but
nothing
overly
exciting
or
bold
id
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
session
beer
material
this
beauty
pours
out
a
pitch
coloured
deep
and
dark
ruby
tan
head
which
sticks
leaving
lots
of
lace
very
pleasant
roasted
barley
aromas
augmented
by
subtle
chocolate
and
nut
hints
lots
of
roasted
notes
come
through
in
the
flavour
profile
bits
of
burnt
coffee
and
astringent
bitterness
leaves
the
tongue
longing
for
more
body
though
as
the
mouthfeel
comes
across
weak
and
even
a
bit
watery
i
like
the
taste
and
character
nonetheless
and
im
thinking
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
have
on
tap
a
mighty
fine
breakfast
stout
im
thinking
lots
to
excite
the
senses
without
being
heavy
or
even
filling
easy
drinkability
with
full
roasted
stout
flavour
a
winner
and
nice
changeup
among
the
irish
stout
examples
a
truly
lovely
stout
that
is
impressive
in
its
evenness
the
pour
showed
a
very
very
dark
mahogany
tending
toward
black
opacity
the
head
was
somewhat
disappointingly
small
but
did
give
a
small
compact
and
creamy
crown
of
beige
the
nose
was
robust
and
mostly
of
malted
roasted
chocolate
the
taste
was
likewise
mostly
of
roasted
chocolate
with
hints
of
cofee
and
some
light
smokiness
the
head
moved
to
a
lovely
tan
as
it
quickly
diminished
and
left
light
deposits
of
lace
eminently
drinkable
and
ejoyable
it
is
creamy
but
a
tad
light
in
feel
drinkability
fairly
average
this
is
a
decent
dry
stout
but
nothing
special
wowwhat
a
great
beer
this
reminds
me
of
what
guinness
tastes
like
in
ireland
the
thick
foamy
beige
head
stays
with
the
pour
i
think
i
can
float
a
quarter
on
it
and
there
is
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
beer
is
dark
brown
nearly
black
taste
is
weak
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
but
rolls
across
the
middle
and
down
the
sides
toward
the
back
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
smokey
highly
roasted
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
i
could
drink
this
all
night
really
nice
irish
stout
notes
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
for
someone
wanting
to
try
a
stout
and
isnt
ready
to
dance
with
an
imperial
stout
this
beer
poured
a
truley
black
with
a
fair
amount
of
tan
head
the
aroma
was
faint
but
suggested
roasted
malt
taste
was
a
crisp
dry
bitterness
roasted
malt
and
expresso
dominate
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
not
bad
at
all
a
bit
of
a
change
from
guiness
but
not
something
ill
be
drinking
regularly
served
near
black
in
appearance
with
a
thick
airy
yet
creamy
light
tan
head
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
smooth
fullbodied
mouthfeel
rich
burnt
malt
flavor
accompanied
with
roasted
coffee
tones
hop
bitterness
is
very
apparent
in
this
stouts
finish
signature
hop
bitterness
might
be
what
makes
oharas
stand
out
from
the
other
big
three
guinness
murphys
and
beamish
a
very
good
stout
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
others
i
guess
im
used
to
hearty
full
bodied
stouts
but
the
thinness
of
this
beer
makes
it
easy
to
drink
overall
the
flavor
is
good
and
does
not
overwhelm
you
this
may
be
a
good
starter
stout
for
the
less
adventurous
while
not
a
flavor
powerhouse
this
stout
is
highly
drinkable
pours
out
to
the
usual
darkness
that
is
associated
with
this
style
with
a
generous
light
brown
head
nice
roasted
malt
presence
a
tad
thin
but
evens
out
with
a
slight
sweetness
that
mixes
in
with
the
roasted
malt
in
the
end
you
could
drink
these
all
night
this
stout
when
held
to
a
light
had
a
cherry
and
copper
color
that
penetrated
through
the
darkness
the
head
was
nice
out
of
the
bottle
and
would
love
to
see
this
one
in
a
nitreo
can
very
nice
roassted
nose
and
and
semisweet
chocolate
the
taste
followed
with
nice
deep
roasted
and
espresso
flavors
and
a
nice
drying
hop
preasance
that
compliments
the
mild
sweetness
of
this
stout
there
is
a
certain
twang
in
the
hops
and
finish
that
is
unique
but
good
also
i
did
get
the
very
small
metalic
taste
as
noted
by
another
reviewer
but
it
did
not
detract
at
all
from
the
beer
highly
recommended
and
it
was
a
great
bargain
at
under
6
for
a
sixer
on
sale
from
8
on
st
pattys
day
at
crazy
bruces
in
new
britain
poured
a
jet
black
color
with
huge
pillowey
head
took
a
while
for
it
to
come
down
smell
was
of
bitter
chocolate
and
pretty
sweet
i
thought
the
taste
was
real
smokey
and
burnt
and
somewhat
dry
and
oily
like
the
firm
body
of
this
not
thin
and
watery
by
any
stretch
good
to
find
another
fine
example
of
a
dry
irish
stout
ive
sampled
both
draught
and
bottle
versions
of
this
beer
and
both
contain
quite
similar
properties
pours
a
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
the
aromas
were
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
coffee
taste
if
full
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
roasted
coffee
beans
with
mild
undertones
of
hops
and
chocolate
which
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
an
extremely
easy
drinking
stout
this
is
a
must
have
for
any
stout
lover
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
redbrown
with
a
large
rocky
tan
head
with
a
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
the
smell
was
of
roasted
smokey
malt
overwhelming
any
hop
smells
the
taste
was
smokey
malt
with
a
slight
chocolate
sweetness
and
a
mild
bitter
finish
a
very
nice
dry
irish
stout
that
is
i
think
superior
to
most
others
pretty
decent
stuff
the
palate
features
big
smoky
burned
grain
flavors
the
finish
displays
an
iron
grip
of
charred
bitterness
which
obscures
any
sweetness
that
this
beer
has
there
is
a
fluffy
yielding
texture
as
well
serve
with
blackened
seafood
this
is
an
easydrinking
smooth
stout
it
has
a
guinnesslike
appearance
but
a
much
better
aroma
of
roasted
malts
a
wellbalanced
brew
the
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
subtly
come
through
and
then
hops
come
through
a
little
bit
on
the
dry
finish
i
enjoyed
this
stout
quite
a
bit
obviously
thinking
its
a
wonderful
session
stout
source
savannah
ga
pours
a
beautiful
black
with
a
creamy
212
finger
head
that
dissipates
to
a
nice
thick
lumpy
layer
the
smell
of
light
roasted
malts
with
a
coffee
background
makes
this
an
enticing
aroma
the
taste
consists
of
burnt
malt
in
a
good
sense
and
a
light
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
with
perfectly
blended
hops
the
creamy
mouthfeel
of
this
medium
to
heavy
bodied
brew
goes
down
nicely
it
finishes
lightly
on
the
dry
side
and
goes
down
with
ease
thank
you
mccall
for
the
opportunity
sláinte
interesting
this
doesnt
taste
like
guinness
to
me
at
all
my
first
irish
micro
nearly
black
with
big
poufy
head
that
subsides
excellent
roasted
barley
aroma
very
bitter
almost
biting
a
combination
of
sharptasting
hops
and
the
dark
malts
a
big
hit
of
black
coffee
at
first
sip
i
thought
there
were
some
unappealing
off
flavors
mostly
the
hops
which
are
grassy
and
grating
however
i
grew
accustomed
to
them
and
began
to
enjoy
them
i
think
the
lasting
persuasive
finish
has
something
to
do
with
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
replacement
for
guinness
get
some
beamish
if
you
want
something
different
a
rawer
less
creamy
more
uncompromising
beer
check
this
out
it
could
be
the
effects
of
their
marketing
but
i
like
to
imagine
this
is
what
irish
stout
tasted
like
in
the
days
of
yore
im
betting
that
if
you
poured
this
brew
into
an
empty
bottle
of
guinness
extra
stout
you
could
fool
most
of
the
people
most
of
the
time
by
the
numbers
interpretation
of
the
classic
irish
dry
stout
style
roasty
but
smooth
and
quaffable
with
no
surprises
goes
down
easy
puts
the
mind
at
ease
this
stout
poured
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
deep
black
body
and
a
nice
creamy
looking
head
the
aroma
was
of
deeply
roasted
grain
with
hints
of
a
rich
coffee
and
perhaps
a
wee
bit
of
smokey
peat
the
taste
starts
with
a
toasted
grain
bite
and
just
a
bit
of
black
malt
bitterness
hops
are
only
there
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
dont
interfere
with
the
overall
grain
flavor
but
this
stout
finishes
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
body
and
after
taste
it
started
out
with
such
promise
and
finished
with
a
bit
of
a
let
down
a
little
more
mouthfeel
and
a
continuation
of
the
rich
grain
flavor
in
the
finish
and
this
would
be
a
great
stout
in
my
humble
opinion
not
a
halfbad
stout
it
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
good
stout
unfortunately
it
fell
just
a
little
short
in
most
areas
nice
roasted
aroma
with
hints
of
coffee
that
wafted
as
i
drank
it
almost
black
with
a
medium
beuge
head
roasted
nutty
coffee
flavoring
but
it
was
a
little
too
carbonated
and
thin
for
my
tastes
pours
a
very
dark
black
with
only
a
bit
of
light
slipping
in
around
the
edges
a
nice
dark
chocolate
bittersweet
flavor
accompanies
a
subtle
bitter
coffee
aroma
in
this
one
the
first
taste
is
of
bitter
roastedburnt
malts
that
slowly
turns
into
a
nice
slightly
bitter
chocolate
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
bitter
flourish
the
brew
is
nicely
dry
and
smooth
enough
to
keep
the
drinkability
high
this
is
a
very
nice
alternative
to
guinness
and
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
draught
or
cask
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
purplish
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
head
that
left
some
nice
lace
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
coffee
the
taste
was
of
burnt
coffee
and
malt
the
body
was
lighter
than
some
others
of
this
style
had
a
burnt
coffee
finish
to
it
as
well
not
a
bad
beer
if
your
wanting
a
change
from
guiness
this
beer
has
a
very
good
drinkability
this
dark
roasted
brew
was
my
first
irish
it
was
very
smooth
overall
pours
black
with
a
goodlooking
dark
tan
puffy
head
and
great
lace
the
taiste
is
bittersweet
yes
with
a
stronger
hoppy
dark
chocolate
sence
i
thought
the
body
was
alittle
lite
as
i
sipped
this
over
a
halfhour
it
seemed
to
fade
or
water
down
overall
a
very
good
dry
stout
for
perhaps
a
special
occasion
i
had
mine
sipped
while
getting
ready
for
a
wedding
dark
nearly
opaque
smooth
creamy
nitro
induced
head
rich
aroma
consisting
of
dark
roasted
coffee
dark
chocolate
hints
of
chocolate
milk
and
hops
nuttiness
also
comes
to
mind
a
suggestion
of
sweetness
differentiates
oharas
from
other
dry
stouts
that
emphasize
bitterness
imho
i
find
this
enhances
the
flavor
and
drinkability
pleasantly
bittersweet
one
of
the
hoppier
irish
stouts
ive
tried
a
fine
brew
deep
black
just
a
touch
of
ruby
where
the
light
comes
through
at
the
bottom
tan
puffy
head
a
good
34
of
an
inch
aroma
muted
and
not
pronounced
somewhat
astringent
coffee
tastes
roasted
malts
seem
more
subtle
than
some
dry
stouts
not
very
burly
in
impact
fades
consistently
noted
a
papery
or
wheat
paste
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
that
was
somewhat
unpleasant
to
me
this
was
a
decent
but
not
great
irish
stout
may
have
been
subject
to
aging
this
beer
is
not
black
but
very
very
close
pours
a
nice
dense
rocky
brown
head
nice
dry
roasted
aroma
almondyou
can
smell
the
roasted
bitterness
taste
is
nice
like
black
coffee
the
coffee
tones
are
pretty
dominant
in
this
one
i
also
get
some
bittersweet
chocolate
nice
stout
nice
full
body
it
has
some
similarities
to
guiness
maybe
its
the
water
after
all
but
i
think
this
one
is
better
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
drinkable
nice
little
stout
here
not
a
bad
stout
about
the
same
overall
quality
as
guinness
or
maybe
a
tad
bit
better
after
having
the
this
beer
and
molings
irish
red
or
maybe
it
was
the
traditional
celtic
the
bar
called
it
molings
celtic
red
which
is
neither
of
the
beers
name
ive
come
to
appreciate
this
brewery
they
make
good
beers
deep
and
dark
o
haras
pours
a
healthy
beige
head
and
leaves
a
trail
of
lace
all
round
the
pint
glass
mildly
toasted
nose
dry
roasty
finish
typical
of
the
style
as
much
pleasure
as
i
get
from
watching
the
pint
empty
i
cant
help
but
wonder
why
i
didnt
buy
more
of
this
easy
drinking
stout
i
guess
this
brewery
has
only
been
around
for
about
5
years
in
ireland
but
based
on
my
first
two
beers
of
this
their
stout
certainly
blows
away
guiness
this
is
definitely
a
dry
stout
i
prefer
milk
or
sweet
stouts
and
is
an
outstanding
one
at
that
perfect
black
color
and
slick
creamy
head
mild
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
cocoa
and
roasted
coffee
beans
this
is
a
flavorful
dry
stout
with
a
dry
toasty
finish
it
is
considerably
more
flavorfull
than
guiness
i
wouldnt
call
it
fullbodied
in
fact
its
quite
easy
drinking
if
you
think
you
like
guiness
i
highly
suggest
finding
some
of
this
this
is
an
excellent
stout
id
love
to
taste
it
sidebyside
with
some
of
bells
best
i
spent
over
10
for
a
sixpack
and
it
is
well
worth
it
i
had
not
even
heard
of
this
brew
what
a
pleasant
surprise
an
excellent
dry
stout
with
very
fine
charred
bread
crust
and
malted
milk
ball
flavors
it
leaves
a
nice
dry
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
as
the
smooth
malt
sweetness
fades
away
on
your
tongue
a
great
find
for
stout
lovers
pitch
black
beer
with
a
creamy
white
head
nose
is
the
malt
character
of
an
ris
but
a
full
cocoa
roundness
hints
of
coffee
and
the
lightest
minty
pine
from
the
english
hops
taste
is
smooth
like
a
nitro
but
not
chocolate
coffee
caramel
and
a
full
malt
bill
with
light
roast
to
balance
out
maybe
a
touch
of
nutiness
very
dry
but
a
round
slickness
that
gives
a
sweet
impression
lightest
hop
at
the
end
that
lingers
with
the
chocolate
it
sticks
in
the
nose
as
well
wow
this
beer
far
surpasses
the
other
oharas
ive
had
what
a
treat
and
a
hella
price
over
at
tullys
in
wells
2
50
a
330
bottle
or
something
so
many
surprise
beers
in
so
little
time
leann
folláin
has
the
characteristics
of
a
dry
stout
yet
has
the
flavor
of
an
imperial
stout
excellent
excellent
beer
which
needs
to
be
sought
out
onice
dry
stout
with
good
flavor
wish
it
had
a
little
more
body
o
a
lot
more
complexity
than
i
expected
with
such
a
light
and
airy
mouthfeel
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
quite
flavorful
the
flavor
is
very
coffee
and
biscuit
from
the
malt
up
front
with
a
slight
caramel
tinge
in
the
mid
palate
and
herbal
hops
add
complexity
in
the
flavor
with
the
light
mineral
yeast
accent
and
subtle
smoke
in
the
taste
from
the
highly
kilned
malt
delivers
a
nice
amount
of
layered
flavor
with
some
light
cocoa
notes
and
wood
notes
with
earthy
elements
in
the
background
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
i
didnt
expect
so
much
malt
complexity
but
this
is
a
topnotch
example
of
the
style
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
stout
fan
leann
follain
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
irish
dry
stout
its
got
a
bit
more
flavor
than
most
irish
dry
stouts
with
the
very
well
balanced
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavors
mingling
nicely
the
flavor
doesnt
linger
for
long
leaving
a
nice
dry
finish
overall
a
great
irish
dry
stout
thats
a
bit
stronger
and
more
interesting
than
the
pack
this
review
is
being
updated
in
the
smell
department
after
another
try
i
think
i
must
have
had
a
stuffed
nose
cause
the
smell
on
this
is
really
amazing
the
notes
are
the
same
as
above
but
with
a
creamy
sweet
smell
that
is
really
excellent
o
this
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
flavorful
given
its
lightbodied
nature
pairs
well
with
irish
beef
stew
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
latticework
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
coffee
beans
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cookie
dough
and
cocoa
powder
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
super
easy
to
drink
poured
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
with
some
mahogany
highlights
when
held
to
the
lighta
frothy
one
finger
tan
colored
head
atop
ton
of
coffee
roast
with
some
woody
smokinesspretty
much
like
a
mocha
coffee
a
little
sharper
than
expected
in
the
mouthi
would
like
more
of
a
smooth
creamy
feel
dry
heavy
roast
on
the
palate
with
some
bitter
chocolate
underneathit
has
a
little
more
oomph
to
it
compared
to
others
of
the
style
not
bad
but
the
feel
takes
away
from
a
pretty
good
beer
o
and
as
i
finish
my
glass
i
notice
the
bottle
cap
somehow
fell
down
in
there
how
the
hell
did
that
happen
oh
well
this
a
fine
offering
not
great
but
fine
picked
up
on
a
recent
trip
to
dublin
had
trouble
liking
this
one
has
good
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
thats
where
the
goodness
ends
it
has
an
unexpectedly
sharp
bite
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
hoppy
so
im
kind
of
confused
where
that
bite
comes
from
it
also
tastes
quite
roastedsmokey
sort
of
overpowers
any
other
subtle
flavors
that
might
be
hiding
underneath
this
was
very
much
like
a
chocolate
stout
wasnt
t
expecting
it
tried
the
pale
ale
from
this
brewery
and
wasnt
t
near
as
nice
a
brew
as
this
one
a
dessert
beer
no
doubt
enjoyed
will
get
another
one
for
ageing
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
for
an
export
strength
stout
i
hope
they
can
reproduce
this
in
bottles
especially
the
hoppiness
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
typical
style
irish
dry
stout
but
too
expensive
taste
is
excellent
after
having
the
regular
dry
stout
this
one
is
much
better
roast
is
exceptionally
smoother
than
most
dry
stouts
an
amazing
feat
that
fades
seamlessly
into
dark
chocolate
fruit
is
prevalent
but
never
goes
overboard
body
is
full
without
being
sweet
another
impressive
aspect
the
bitterness
throws
in
a
nice
curveball
too
best
o
the
ohara
bunch
me
thinks
overall
leann
folláin
is
one
of
the
better
irish
dry
stouts
that
ive
tried
its
bold
flavours
and
layered
aromas
make
it
an
unusually
intricate
example
of
the
style
a
great
brew
that
i
would
recommend
to
any
beer
geek
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
i
am
pleased
to
have
tried
will
have
again
dr
drinkable
but
not
fantastic
ignore
this
beer
even
if
youre
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
like
me
its
far
too
expensive
for
how
mediocre
it
is
d
it
took
me
a
long
while
to
drink
this
beer
as
it
was
already
almost
at
room
temperature
off
the
cask
that
wasnt
a
problem
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
a
pint
of
at
a
time
definitely
for
savoring
the
best
irish
beer
i
had
on
my
trip
to
ireland
overall
this
is
what
irish
stouts
should
taste
like
the
best
in
this
style
that
ive
had
it
isnt
a
foreign
export
because
it
lacks
the
sourness
and
heavy
hops
and
it
isnt
a
true
irish
dry
because
its
a
bit
heavier
and
much
more
robust
take
it
for
what
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ireland
has
to
offer
recommended
d
overall
the
drinkability
was
a
little
hard
i
would
probably
only
have
1
and
only
once
in
awhile
i
would
have
it
again
when
im
looking
for
a
change
in
pace
in
irish
stouts
d
all
told
i
prefer
oharas
standard
irish
stout
this
is
more
akin
to
chocolate
milk
than
i
care
for
nice
enough
but
not
recommended
ok
false
alarm
picked
this
up
in
sheils
off
licence
on
dorset
street
dublin
for
about
e2
40
per
bottle
pours
almost
pitch
black
in
colour
with
a
dark
brown
hue
on

inspection
head
is
latte
in
colour
settles
after
pouring
to
about
a
fingernails
height
in
the
glass
and
is
retained
well
aroma
is
quite
complex
cocoa
coffee
and
malt
with
some
burntroasted
notes
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
strong
coffee
smoke
and
dark
chocolate
flavours
mouthfeel
is
quite
dry
and
cleansing
on
the
palate
goes
down
nicely
very
drinkable
dry
stout
that
doesnt
fill
you
up
too
quickly
and
the
6
volume
isnt
too
taxing
all
in
all
its
an
excellent
stout
and
well
worth
a
go
overall
a
very
good
and
slightly
unusual
example
of
a
irish
dry
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
despite
a
relatively
tam
abv
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
with
lots
of
malts
and
roasted
flavors
that
work
toward
an
effective
balance
all
that
flavor
make
this
brew
a
bit
tiring
on
the
palate
but
the
sort
of
satisfying
tiredness
that
comes
after
a
good
workout
not
from
boredom
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
certainly
worth
a
try
commercial
transnational
parody
on
a
good
beer
pours
deep
black
highly
carbonated
nice
frothy
head
smells
of
smooth
roasted
malts
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
malts
goes
down
real
smooth
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
really
good
irish
dry
stout
high
recommend
enjoyed
in
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
decent
head
and
nice
lacing
nose
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
roasted
earthy
grains
flavors
of
chocolate
up
front
mingles
with
lightly
sweet
malts
and
a
dry
slightly
sweet
clean
finish
makes
this
a
good
session
stout
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
solid
but
not
a
big
robust
stout
o
drinks
like
something
stronger
another
great
offering
from
fullers
a
little
bitter
limp
soft
pours
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
thin
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
very
thin
layering
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
light
spotty
lacing
is
seen
and
actually
leaves
a
light
ring
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
but
is
faint
perfect
carbonation
the
taste
of
roast
malts
are
right
up
front
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
and
coffee
even
more
going
on
with
the
taste
than
what
the
aroma
suggests
very
slight
dry
finish
but
doesnt
last
overall
a
very
decent
brew
o
do
not
serve
too
cold
a
richer
and
more
complex
flavor
unfolds
at
warmer
temps
very
good
stout
dry
and
relatively
unsweetened
with
nice
roasted
notes
assertive
but
not
boring
the
taste
also
brings
out
the
dark
malts
sweetness
and
caramel
while
the
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
is
a
but
more
muted
but
definitely
there
there
is
a
dry
lingering
finish
great
pub
beer
bring
it
on
overall
easy
chocolaty
roasty
sipper
nice
balance
good
stuff
o
a
real
surprise
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
the
balance
is
just
wonderful
and
a
blast
of
flavour
for
a
4
5
beer
no
black
cab
for
me
to
take
me
home

of
these

enjoyable
offering
the
mouthfeel
was
mildly
creamy
with
a
thin
to
medium
body
this
one
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
porter
rather
than
a
stout
however
i
like
it
despite
how
it
is
categorized
i
like
fullers
a
lot
but
admittedly
did
not
realize
they
offer
an
irish
dry
stout
until
stumbling
across
this
brew
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
here
in
calgary
these
guys
should
pay
me
for
all
the
namedropping
i
do
on
here
i
will
accept
payment
in

16
oz
pint
presented
as
dark
opaque
black
with
flickers
of
brown
not
even
a
colored
halo
just
inky
blackness
except
for
the
moderate
amount
of
tan
head
major
black
licorice
on
the
nose
along
with
wood
smoke
and
hints
of
fresh
dough
major
licorice
on
the
palate
as
well
while
some
stouts
offer
ample
coffee
and
chocolate
this
one
combines
an
earthy
bittersweet
element
with
malt
to
yield
a
flavor
remarkably
like
licorice
allsorts
candy
doused
with
smoke
fruit
is
difficult
to
detect
as
the
sweetness
is
more
herbal
or
medicinal
in
character
a
little
chocolate
emerges
here
and
there
crisp
and
chalky
with
burnt
wood
and
grainy
husk
in
the
finish
very
dry
but
never
quite
loses
the
licorice
sweetness
nice
take
on
the
style
and
perhaps
my
experience
benefited
from
the
beer
being
superfresh
on
tap
unidimensional
but
i
dont
expect
irish
stouts
to
be
as
complex
as
some
heavier
north
american
examples
a
decent
irish
dry
the
roastedness
and
fuller
hah
rounder
mouthfeel
when
compared
to
you
know
who
making
for
an
enjoyable
tipple
it
is
nice
to
sip
on
a
stout
and
not
feel
the
heat
as
well
worthy
of
this
convivial
yuletide
pub
atmosphere
i
must
say
creamy
yet
dry
in
flavour
and
mouth
feel
easy
on
the
palate
and
one
of
the
best
uk
brewed
stouts
around
overall
a
very
good
and
delicious
example
of
the
style
mo
lightly
carbonated
on
the
mouthfeel
not
silky
smooth
as
the
london
porter
against
a
medium
body
of
roast
maltled
flavour
profile
all
in
all
a
very
decent
english
stout
that
is
easily
quaffable
without
going
boring
that
easily
easy
drinker
spot
on
for
the
style
would
to
try
this
on
cask
or
nitro
pitch
black
with
a
healthy
beige
head
that
cascades
nicely
leaving
an
inch
of
pillowy
foam
not
much
aroma
as
you
might
expect
from
a
dry
irish
stout
taste
the
malt
flavor
is
subdued
a
little
too
much
slight
bitterness
on
the
end
mouthfeel
not
as
dry
as
expected
very
little
carbonation
very
smooth
this
would
be
a
great
stout
for
someone
just
getting
acquainted
with
the
style
or
if
you
like
the
lighter
side
of
stouts
its
mild
and
smooth
and
with
a
low
abv
of
4
5
it
goes
down
very
easy
overall
a
nice
quenching
and
satisfying
brew
usually
not
associated
with
term
quenching
this
stout
probably
possesses
that
quality
due
to
its
low
abv
but
a
great
drinker
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
smoothly
foamy
mouthfeel
that
fits
the
flavor
profile
perfectly
a
modestly
smoothsipping

quite
dry

expected
from
the
roast

a

a

if
youre
looking
for

thats

in
this

overall
a
super
mellow
beer
i
could
see
drinking
this
often
if
it
was
easier
to
get
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
with
mellowness
this
is
hands
down
the
best
under

beer
i
can
think
of
so
much
flavor
so
much
complexity
and
just
well
damn
at
4
bucks
a
glass
its
a
touch
high
but
on
draft
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
someone
whos
got
a
drive
and
wants
a
bit
more
volume
without
you
know
drinking
crap
o
good
drinkability
lovely
british
stout
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
would
be
thrilled
to
drink
it
regularly
and
in
quantity
it
might
be
the
best
low
abv
stout
that
ive
ever
tried
i
tend
to
get
a
bit
excited
by
welldone
english
beers
and
this
is
a
great
example
to
find
at
my
local
store
which
is
more
than
5000
miles
from
griffin
brewery
so
thats
nice
anywho
black
cab
is
an
excellent
beer
and
id
love
to
see
it
included
in
the
fantastic
fullers
regular
lineup
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
stout
overall
an
interesting
stout
that
is
unlike
many
of
the
others
out
there
not
extremely
interesting
but
one
to
pick
up
if
you
are
in
search
of
something
unique
and
different
big
roast
character
coffee
chocolate
and
espresso
flavors
abound
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
dry
through
out
with
a
roastiness
lingering
in
the
mouth
maybe
not
the
best
pairing
for
sushi
but
im
liking
this
beer
this
makes
for
a
decent
example
of
an
english
stout
it
is
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
find
a
nice
taste
of
england
and
always
nice
to
have
a
fullers
either
here
or
in
london
this
is
a
good
stout
overall
nice
flavor
throughout
its
a
little
weak
in
the
body
for
my
preference
but
there
is
plenty
to
enjoy
tastewise
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
lowalcohol

ale

really
one
sided
big
dry
roastiness
on
the
palateearthy
with
some
woodiness
with
underlying
bitter
chocolate
that
off
sets
the
roast
just
enough
this
is
old
school
with
its
big
roast
and
dryer
tones
interesting
flavorfull
and
sessionable
at

a
nice
match
for
a
burger
or
a
steak
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
poundable
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
this
was
nice
to
try
as
i
always
enjoy
anything
from
fullers
but
this
is
one
of
their
weaker
offerings
for
the
price
point
quantity
and
availability
i
would
just
rather
get
a
6pack
of
their
porter
because
it
is
a
better
beer
regardless
of
style
great
for
the
drinkability
and
sessionability
but
lacks
a
tad
in
the
overall
flavor
profile
black
cab
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
very
filling
and
enjoyable

same
again
please
its
hard
to
put
any
stout
or
porter
against
fullers
london
porter
and
expect
to
win
and
i
dont
think
this
one
does
that
but
a
brews
job
isnt
to
be
better
than
something
else
each
style
has
their
own
positive
attributes
and
this
one
has
those
in
spades
this
is
a
drier
brew
and
a
damned
sessionable
one
at
that
and
i
likes
it
fine
o
really
wanted
to
love
it
just
fell
short
of
the
porter
i
am
so
very
fond
of
m
balanced
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
just
a
little
detail
is
that
body
is
not
bold
enough
for
a
stout
besides
that
is
a
very
well
done
beer
with
character
and
excelente
sensation
in
the
mouth
o
this
beer
is
a
nice
light
stout
that
is
perfectly
sessionable
a
very
powerful
stout
maximal
darkness
o
a
superb
dry
stout
excelent
for
any
occasion
overall
a
great
beer
note
labeled

5
in
bottles
overall
black
cab
is
a
solid
fullflavoured
dry
stout
with
one
of
the
chalkiest
palates
that
ive
encountered
in
a
while
a
great
pick
for
a
wintertime
session
thanks
for
bringing
this
in
milos
o
not
bad
but
i
was
let
down
by
the
taste
it
just
could
have
been
a
bit
maltier
and
if
it
had
the
chocolate
undertones
the
aroma
delivered
i
would
have
been
very
happy
with
it
i
guess
i
cant
be
too
critical
though
as
it
is
a
dry
stout
maybe
just
not
my
style
of
stout
dark
black
in
colour
with
a
thin
cap
of
beige
head
black
cab
is
dominated
with
coffee
and
cocoa
flavours
with
some
roasted
barley
character
and
a
nice
hit
of
bitterness
but
in
a
restarined
way
despite
the
strong
flavour
descriptors
this
stout
is
mild
and
restrained
its
is
boldly
flavoured
but
not
intense
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
drinking
nothing
exciting
but
a
solid
stout
o
a
somewhat
enjoyable
english
stout
served
on
cask
however
i
personally
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
as
there
is
just
nothing
going
on
for
me
other
than
coffee
id
be
curious
to
try
this
on
draft
and
a
little
colder
to
see
if
the
profile
of
the
beer
changes
as
temp
changes
d
not
bad
looks
very
watery
could
use
more
body
still
looking
for
those
chocolate
notes
otherwise
it
makes
a
good
stout
and
after
dinner
or
bar
time
drink
o
not
my
favorite
version
of
a
stout
lacking
sweetness
and
depth
more
of
an
irish
stout
than
american
good
frothy
body
and
flavor
but
a
bit
watery
overall
a
fine
stout
which
i
would
recommend
in
light
of
the
typical
shelf
beers
which
proliferate
the
liquor
stores
however
the
ratings
posted
are
seemingly
out
of
reach
somewhat
for
this
brew
at
least
in
my
opinion
very
sorry
i
went
to
this
pub
food
was
ok
but
the
beers
were
mediocre
to
poor
best
stout
ever
brewed
in
a
traditional
irish
style
this
allmalt
stout
is
well
balanced
and
packed
with
roasted
flavor
if
in
maine
you
need
to
look
for
this
one
sold
in
bottles
and
on
tap
at
their
freeport
me
restaurant
and
pub
o
hands
down
the
best
beer
grittys
offers
i
would
drink
it
again
o
decent
stout
mouthfeel
is
the
best
o
a
surprisingly
belgianish
stout
as
though
some
yeast
jumped
over
to
grittys
from
allagash
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
at
the
beginning
for
that
reason
since
i
had
been
expecting
a
heavier
smokier
more
traditional
stout
flavor
but
it
is
tasty
enough
and
gradually
becomes
more
pleasing
until
it
has
warmed
over
sixty
degrees
when
it
becomes
somewhat
bitter
the
very
low
abv
allows
you
to
drink
the
whole
bomber
and
still
remain
fairly
clearheaded
cheers
overall
an
excellent
irish
stout
however
the
serving
temp
is
very
important
above
board
as
i
heard
a
number
of
irish
bartenders
say
a
while
back
this
is
the
best
regularly
available
grittys
brew
that
i
was
able
to
taste
worth
going
back
for
more
oda
good
nitro
offering
that
i
would
grab
again
probably
easily
the
best
beer
on
at
grittys
hands
down
honestly
the
only
one
i
had
that
i
would
care
to
drink
again
it
pours
a
really
dark
brown
almost
black
letting
not
a
smidge
of
light
pass
the
head
is
only
small
but
its
a
clue
to
the
delicious
creamy
texture
of
this
brew
lots
of
roast
in
nose
and
taste
not
quite
burnt
but
still
rather
bitter
with
faint
english
hops
being
detectable
in
the
finish
the
flavor
fits
the
style
guidelines
well
but
the
mouthfeel
is
what
makes
this
beer
a
keeper
its
subtle
and
mellow
for
a
beer
as
flavorful
as
this
its
got
a
very
full
body
and
feels
like
it
could
have
come
from
a
nitro
tap
even
though
it
didnt
i
liked
it
more
and
more
as
it
warmed
and
while
it
might
not
be
the
best
accompaniment
to
a
lobster
roll
it
felt
right
as
i
drank
it
really
the
only
decent
beer
happening
from
these
guys
so
get
some
while
you
can
a
good
stout
with
a
nice
crisp
taste
it
was
very
flavorable
and
went
well
with
my
food
the
beer
had
a
thick
head
that
hung
around
on
the
glass
until
the
end
the
beer
had
a
distinctive
smell
the
beer
is
lighter
than
many
stouts
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
over
all
a
good
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
had
another
o
this
stout
seems
somewhat
lighter
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
is
very
easy
to
drinkthat
is
once
the
massive
head
finally
subsides
i
wouldnt
consider
the
bottled
version
to
be
sessionable
but
having
this
on
a
nitrotap
might
be
a
different
story
note
i
had
this
beer
maybe
10
years
ago
and
i
remember
enjoying
it
then
im
happy
to
see
my
taste
for
this
beer
had
withstood
the
test
of
time
22oz
bottle
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
some
brown
hues
over
an
inch
of
thick
frothy
tan
head
tons
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
malty
slightly
sour
with
an
aroma
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
oatmeal
stout
the
taste
is
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
earth
roasty
towards
the
end
with
a
slightly
sour
finish
heavily
carbonated
slick
tingly
mouthfeel
overall
good
example
of
the
style
o
the
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
overall
though
the
hop
flavors
are
not
really
pronounced
they
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
just
an
allaround
great
beer
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
its
rich
dark
tasty
and
infinitely
sessionable
more
complex
than
your
average
irish
dry
to
boot
what
more
could
you
want
i
wish
i
could
swap
out
every
guinness
tap
around
me
with
this
stuff
pretty
solid
overall
and
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
o
i
really
liked
this
one
probably
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
in
a
long
while
i
think
that
this
one
is
a
must
try
o
this
is
an
excellent
choice
for
an
irish
dry
stout
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
by
grittys
will
have
to
try
again
fresh
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
brown
highlight
around
the
edges
there
is
a
thin
film
of
milkchocolate
colored
head
that
coats
the
top
of
the
brew
aromas
are
of
deep
coffee
campfire
smoke
and
char
very
bitter
and
dark
chocolate
and
some
sharp
spicing
throughout
maybe
some
cinnamon
and
pepper
flavors
are
light
and
very
dry
with
a
dark
roasted
coffee
ground
flavor
front
and
center
followed
by
campfire
smoke
and
a
meaty
highlight
the
body
is
light
smooth
and
extremely
dry
which
is
a
perfect
representation
of
the
style
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
smoke
with
a
rich
and
semisweet
highlight
the
finish
is
dry
and
extremely
clean
chocolatey
notes
finish
off
as
the
flavors
clear
very
tasty
beer
great
for
a
campfire
i
originally
reviewed
this
as
a
regular
stout
it
makes
a
bit
more
sense
as
an
irish
dry
i
will
try
another
bottle
soon
to
see
if
this
one
was
not
good
and
fresh
definitely
worth
trying
and
is
highly
recommended
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
thought
it
was
well
done
although
i
think
it
would
benefit
from
co2
as
opposed
to
nitrogen
still
its
worth
a
shot
however
you
find
it
the
darker
flavors
are
the
first
on
the
tongue
and
dominate
most
of
the
mouthful
bringing
notes
of
burnt
grains
and
chocolate
malts
tobacco
dark
toffees
black
coffee
caramelized
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
esters
the
tobacco
and
burntblack
grains
came
on
stronger
near
the
end
of
the
mouthful
for
me
and
stuck
around
on
my
soft
palate
for
quite
awhile
after
id
swallowed
hops
add
a
nice
background
bitter
fuzz
but
manage
to
avoid
the
grapefruity
floral
notes
that
can
come
along
with
thatnotes
which
would
be
unwelcome
in
a
beer
such
as
this
i
was
surprised
however
that
the
brew
lacked
the
viscosity
that
id
expected
given
the
massive
number
of
ingredients
and
the
mouthfeel
came
across
as
even
thinner
than
a
soda
this
was
slightly
unsatisfying
but
the
fullness
of
the
flavors
went
a
long
way
towards
making
up
for
it
the
feel
is
light
and
fluffy
with
soft
carbonation
very
drinkable
it
doesnt
taste
as
dark
as
it
actually
is
this
is
a
deep
solid
black
color
with
a
thick
brown
head
its
a
very
nicelooking
stout
the
taste
is
interesting
licorice
barley
roasted
malt
and
some
spicy
hops
theres
also
a
bit
of
sourcandy
smell
thats
just
a
little
offputting
the
taste
is
dry
way
dry
astringent
and
a
little
tart
the
licorice
character
is
a
lot
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
dry
and
slightly
light
finish
medium
to
light
body
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
forgettable
stout
md
full
bodied
carbonation
is
low
very
drinkability
good
beer
very
dry
finish
excellent
stout
low
abv
makes
it
really
drinkable
and
super
tasty
overall
this
was
pretty
good
i
will
try
and
sample
grittys
other
offerings
when
possible
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
july
17
2010
the
pour
is
rich
black
with
about
a
half
inch
of
silky
tan
head
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
grains
and
charcoal
fired
malts
with
a
notable
but
light
hoppiness
the
taste
is
nice
and
dry
dark
and
decent
with
hops
i
could
not
quite
define
it
but
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
drinkability
very
good
stout
easy
to
drink
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
have
been
a
recent
stout
convert
and
am
truly
finding
that
there
are
some
great
craft
breweries
out
there
this
is
one
of
them
d
4
1
wow
tons
of
body
and
flavor
for
this
abv
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonanation
smooth
and
creamy
kind
of
a
neat
dry
cocoa
powder
finish
a
pretty
quality
stout
could
knock
a
couple
of
these
down
a
night
good
drinkablity
this
brew
does
not
apologize
for
its
strength
it
wallows
in
it
for
better
or
for
worse
i
will
not
give
it
extremely
high
or
low
marks
but
getting
critical
about
stouts
is
tough
the
style
is
powerful
and
thus
can
hide
all
sorts
of
imperfections
but
it
also
carries
baggage
this
one
is
generally
good
and
i
would
both
buy
it
again
and
try
other
things
from
this
company
it
feels
like
a
maine
stout
should
d
i
couldve
stayed
in
the
bar
all
night
and
kicked
back
a
bunch
of
theses
overall
very
drinkable
and
definitely
abovepar
not
great
but
im
not
into
the
dry
irish
stouts
so
much
good
stuff
pitch
black
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
creamy
brown
head
aroma
is
chocolate
taste
is
cocoa
and
coffee
this
is
too
thin
and
watery
for
me
to
rate
this
any
higher
overall
though
its
pretty
decent
and
something
i
would
purchase
and
recommend
to
my
buddies
d
i
could
have
drank
quite
a
few
of
these
drinkability
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
again
it
is
very
dry
and
solid
d
the
low
abv
made
this
really
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
replacement
for
guinness
much
more
flavor
to
it
m
d
lighter
as
they
often
are
there
is
a
soft
creaminess
there
carbonation
has
a
little
bite
pretty
good
full
flavoured
for
an
irish
dry
drinkability
is
awful
i
really
didnt
like
this
one
and
i
was
disappointed
because
i
have
liked
all
of
the
other
gritty
beers
i
have
tried
d
this
one
went
down
in
a
heartbeat
very
easy
drinking
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
represents
grittys
well
i
would
pick
this
up
again
if
i
was
looking
for
a
good
coffee
stout
features
a
slightly
chocolatey
albeit
chalky
flavor
flavor
is
pretty
straight
forward
blackened
not
overly
sweet
malt
the
standard
grittys
feel
prolly
from
the
yeast
and
a
bit
of
hops
little
thin
not
quite
watery
but
feels
like
there
should
be
something
a
little
more
very
drying
leaves
my
mouth
parched
after
very
drinkable
no
bad
flavors
or
kickbacks
or
anything
if
youre
looking
for
a
sessionable
lowpowered
stout
that
still
has
a
flavor
this
is
a
good
bet
pretty
much
poundable
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
but
but
thin
enough
to
allow
multiples
d
this
one
was
better
than
i
had
anticipated
there
is
a
good
deal
of
earthy
hop
bitterness
in
here
which
was
surprising
overall
this
is
a
solid
irish
stout
i
have
tried
and
enjoyed
this
one
several
time
but
this
review
is
based
off
a
sampling
at
the
brewery
in
auburn
me
from
a
nitrotap
this
brew
was
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
one
finger
head
of
mochalike
foam
the
retention
of
the
tight
cap
was
good
and
the
lacing
off
it
in
thick
sheets
was
outstanding
the
aroma
was
soft
but
appropriate
roasted
malt
and
bittersweet
chocolate
with
a
general
dryness
the
flavors
were
similar
with
an
added
elements
of
caramel
sweetness
and
a
bitter
coffee
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
slightly
watery
and
the
carbonation
a
little
too
soft
but
it
was
still
very
sessionable
for
a
dark
brew
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
that
i
will
happily
enjoy
again
d
being
a
dry
irish
stout
fan
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
low
on
alcohol
great
mouthfeel
real
easy
to
drink
beamish
still
has
my
number
one
spot
but
this
beats
out
oharas
unless
were
talking
about
grittys
on
nitrotap
then
its
by
far
my
favorite
irish
stout
d
drinkability
is
good
the
classic
stout
characteristics
are
present
and
come
together
in
a
nice
way
for
this
beer
the
only
material
flaw
is
the
over
carbonation
normally
this
is
something
that
can
correct
itself
as
the
beer
warms
but
this
one
just
couldnt
get
it
done
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
that
i
could
recommend
to
anyone
that
likes
a
good
stout
a
great
dry
stout
i
prefer
this
very
much
over
guiness
has
a
better
taste
and
more
drinkable
in
my
opinion
aromas
of
roast
barley
clean
sweet
malt
and
a
faint
sharp
acrid
note
like
bitter
espresso
flavor
is
similar
with
initial
malt
sweetness
accompanied
by
roasted
barleycoffee
flavor
and
tarrish
molasses
light
acridacidic
brightness
leading
into
the
dry
and
lightly
minerally
finish
overall
very
nice
but
the
over
carbonation
accentuates
the
more
bitter
acrid
elements
of
the
flavor
my
expectations
where
met
and
is
good
for
style
picked
this
up
on
a
recent
trip
to
maine
beer
pours
a
jet
black
in
the
glass
with
about
a
14
inch
tan
head
with
some
evidence
of
lace
it
smells
creamy
and
sweet
hints
of
burnt
malt
and
slight
chocolate
taste
is
on
par
with
the
smell
bitter
roasted
malt
at
first
that
then
fades
to
smooth
chocolately
flavor
mediumheavy
body
slight
carbonation
its
a
decent
stout
though
ive
had
better
the
taste
is
definitely
light
bodied
yet
with
deep
roasted
grains
some
fruitiness
behind
the
largely
dry
character
to
the
beer
and
an
almost
charred
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
the
wateriness
of
the
beer
the
roasted
dry
malts
the
charred
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
and
the
slight
fruitiness
in
the
background
make
this
an
interesting
slightly
complex
and
eminently
drinkable
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
oily
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
thin
a
nice
change
up
and
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
very
nice
full
bodied
stout
with
a
thick
head
when
poured
it
has
a
dark
color
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
is
rich
and
full
rich
taste
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
cocoa
i
could
make
this
a
regular
in
my
refrigerator
a
very
nice
stout
really
enjoy
it
a
lot
thinner
tasting
than
it
looks
i
liked
that
i
expected
a
meal
and
got
a
dessert
bravo
one
of
my
new
favorite
porterstout
beers
i
may
get
this
again
in
the
future
but
am
in
no
rush
poured
from
a
bomber
into
two
pint
glasses
extremely
dark
black
color
with
a
moderately
sized
brown
head
lots
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
smelled
a
lot
like
coffee
rinds
taste
was
somewhat
on
the
bitter
side
as
it
really
had
a
roasted
barley
flavor
to
it
not
much
sweetness
to
act
as
a
counterbalance
at
all
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
guinness
extra
stout
for
the
style
it
was
dead
on
drinkable
but
with
enough
dryness
to
not
be
a
session
beer
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
other
stouts
that
i
have
had
lately
not
many
local
brewers
can
do
an
irish
dry
stout
and
have
it
taste
this
authentic
good
job
grittys
i
first
tasted
this
on
draft
at
grittys
in
freeport
and
was
great
on
a
warm
day
for
lunch
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
nothing
special
wont
actively
seek
this
brew
again
overall
black
fly
stout
is
a
pretty
good
dry
stout
that
is
recommended
d
i
would
imagine
this
would
be
even
more
drinkable
a
tad
bit
warmer
than
i
drank
it
right
out
of
the
fridge
after
yankee
brew
news
latest
edition
about
session
beers
this
would
be
on
the
list
surprising
for
a
stout
notes
saw
this
case
and
got
excited
had
it
on
tap
years
ago
at
the
brewery
while
in
maine
this
bottle
does
not
do
the
tap
version
justice
as
far
as
the
excessive
head
problem
at
the
brewery
drinkem
if
ya
gotem
im
done
with
this
one
not
good
love
your
label
though
id
consider
this
one
of
grittys
best
beers
if
youre
looking
for
another
mainebrewed
stout
also
check
out
bar
harbors
cadillac
gritty
mcduffs
black
fly
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
chocolate
milk
colored
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
perhaps
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
are
definitely
front
and
center
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
some
nutiness
as
the
beer
warms
i
think
id
like
a
little
more
body
but
its
definitely
a
decent
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
taste
mouthfeel
perfectly
dry
with
a
big
black
coffee
flavor
moderate
bitterness
largely
from
the
dark
malts
no
noticeable
hop
character
theres
a
slight
metallic
twang
to
the
finish
along
with
a
hint
of
acidity
overall
its
not
quite
as
clean
as
i
would
like
but
its
certainly
not
bad
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
even
for
the
style
its
a
bit
watery
d
very
nice
session
stout
but
a
little
thin
as
i
am
use
to
extreme
brews
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
tall
and
medium
bodied
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
nicely
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
of
really
of
deep
roasted
malts
some
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
really
nice
taste
too
deep
roasted
malts
chocolatey
flavors
some
nice
caramel
flavors
intertwined
with
nice
coffee
flavors
it
has
a
really
velvety
and
warming
mouthfeel
that
really
is
nice
and
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
stout
well
worth
it
all
round
really
lacking
in
flavor
black
fly
stout
is
my
third
gritty
mcduffs
brew
and
is
probably
my
least
favorite
its
still
good
beer
though
and
is
probably
a
gottahave
for
dark
beer
lovin
bas
in
the
state
of
maine
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
leaving
about
a
half
of
an
inch
of
tan
head
which
quickly
receded
the
brew
is
dark
black
in
color
the
nose
is
dominated
by
chocolate
with
some
coffee
notes
maybe
a
hint
of
fruit
tasted
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
some
roasty
malt
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
on
the
thin
side
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
black
in
color
no
ruby
notes
around
the
edge
tan
head
that
drops
quickly
and
only
manages
to
leave
the
faintest
lacing
smell
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
some
cherry
in
the
background
also
a
little
bit
of
burnt
smokeyness
taste
matches
the
smell
but
its
really
the
finish
that
makes
this
stand
out
it
finishes
so
dry
and
clean
with
no
aftertaste
its
not
a
lack
of
flavors
upfront
because
its
a
tasty
medium
bodied
beer
but
its
just
a
surprizingly
clean
fishish
overall
a
very
good
brew
the
best
of
the
gritty
variety
case
and
the
only
one
that
seemed
to
match
up
to
what
is
available
fresh
at
the
brewpub
that
said
black
fly
stout
is
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
thanks
largely
in
part
to
the
well
crafted
body
of
the
offering
along
with
the
emphasis
placed
upon
providing
nothing
but
an
excellent
tasting
version
of
an
irish
dry
stout
tasted
on
2608
a
great
session
stout
black
fly

atop

board
in

a
reason
our
drafts

copious

diminished
to
a
nice
sticky
lace
smelling
of
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
dry
spruce
and
starbucks
coffee
delicious
but
oddly
not
all
that
filling
for
a
stout
smooth
if
maybe
a
little
watery
at
the
end
in
the
mouth
with
a
surprisingly
clean

an
oily
slick
mouthful
with
a
dark
burnt
roastedness
fills
the
mouth
gently
warming
and
yielding
to
a
slighty
smokey
and
dark
roasted
coffee
flavor
there
is
a
very
nice
bold
and
charred
bitterness
and
woodiness
to
this
beer
the
dried
cherries
dark
roasted
coffee
and
burnt
roasted
malts
all
blend
together
almost
seamlessly
producing
a
light
bodied
dark
roasted
flavor
there
is
definitely
a
nice
dried
fruitiness
from
the
cherries
emerging
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
before
finishing
with
a
nice
charred
and
smoky
lacing
on
the
tongue
the
texture
is
very
smooth
overall
light
to
medium
body
and
with
a
soft
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
per
style
d
with
a
low
abv
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
great
beer
to
chill
with
during
the
summer
months
or
curling
up
in
the
winter
other
early
impressive
characteristics
simply
cannot
make
up
for
the
unsophisticated
texture
and
low
alcohol
content
d
very
well
done
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
light
enough
to
drink
several
yet
flavorful
enough
to
pair
with
a
variety
of
foods
d
decent
drinkability
the
bitterness
cuts
it
down
quite
a
bit
overall
a
decent
stout
d
average
at
best
not
nearly
enough
flavor
and
all
that
fizzy
feel
makes
it
filling
yet
not
satisfying
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
stout
not
my
favorite
though
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
sorry
i
only
purchased
one
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
malty
character
this
would
be
even
better
if
the
carbonation
were
reigned
in
a
bit
the
taste
and
low
abv
make
this
a
fine
choice
for
a
session
stout
perhaps
i
just
got
an
overcarbonated
batch
otherwise
fine
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
towering
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
scent
that
boasts
of
patent
and
roasted
malts
it
is
quite
dry
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
weak
black
malt
flavor
that
is
bitter
and
earthy
it
has
some
roasted
malt
taste
but
not
enough
to
round
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
dry
stout
the
malt
bill
is
simplistic
so
the
taste
lacks
complexity
this
is
a
very
uninteresting
beer
pours
a
deep
opaque
espresso
brown
with
a
thin
but
well
structured
head
aromatics
of
carob
dark
chocolate
chicory
and
marshmallow
rise
from
the
glass
a
somewhat
lean
stout
based
on
weight
and
structure
fresh
and
delicious
and
easy
to
consume
this
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
heavyweight
super
endowed
stouts
that
are
in
fashion
now
this
is
a
great
beer
with
or
without
food
as
the
mouth
coating
malts
make
for
a
great
side
to
a
nice
meal
or
just
simply
a
meal
in
itself
light
sweetness
ample
malting
and
a
welldefined
recipe
make
this
a
very
satisfying
stout
to
enjoy
anyplaceanytime
well
done
the
feel
is
dry
and
ashy
smooths
out
as
it
warms
up
quite
thick
actually
substantial
i
really
like
this
one
this
time
around
thick
bitter
smooth
but
dry
all
at

that
the
mouthfeel
is

thin
roast
coffee
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
sweet
chocolate
in
the
finish
not
too
bad
for
a
stout
its
definitely
a
stout
for
one
thing
and
a
good
one
pours
pitch
black
from
the
bottle
with
a
brown
two
finger
head
that
settles
to
just
cover
the
beer
with
some
spotty
lacing
no
light
comes
through
the
glass
with
this
beer
aromas
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
taste
is
same
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
palate
and
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
light
nicely
carbonated
drank
three
from
the
sampler
pack
and
could
have
drank
three
more
very
nice
beer
the
deep
darkness
of
this
black
stout
is
enticing
but
in
the
pour
you
immediately
note
the
intense
carbonation
hard
to
keep
it
in
my
pint
glass
the
aroma
of
this
lively
concoction
is
solidly
coffee
to
me
a
nice
mellow
overtone
of
chocolatey
sweetness
but
even
before
it
hits
your
mouth
you
sense
the
bubbling
crispness
of
this
stout
it
explodes
over
the
tongue
almost
like
a
soda
surprisingly
refreshing
for
a
stout
it
finally
quiets
into
a
pleasant
reminder
of
the
same
flavors
anticipated
in
the
aroma
i
was
surprised
by
the
sodalike
quality
and
at
first
disappointed
in
comparison
to
my
first
taste
on
draught
at
the
portland
pub
but
ultimately
i
did
like
it
and
think
it
will
be
a
great
complement
to
the
upcoming
summer
beer
schedule
holy
crap
a
gentle
pour
yielded
a
gigantic
quantity
of
tan
foam
i
could
only
get
half
the
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
itself
was
pretty
much
black
but
had
chestnut
edges
the
foam
settled
quickly
to
a
marshmallowy
cap
with
some
chunky
lacing
left
behind
aromas
were
mostly
malty
plenty
of
character
from
roasted
barley
nuts
roast
and
chocolate
were
all
present
mild
bitterness
balanced
towards
sweetness
a
little
dry
caramel
a
bit
of
roast
towards
the
end
the
initial
co2
release
left
the
body
feeling
a
little
flat
otherwise
it
had
a
nice
texture
not
bad
but
i
may
have
had
an
overcarbonated
bottle
id
give
it
another
shot
drinkability
oh
yeah
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
not
at
all
overpowered
by
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
just
a
healthy
smattering
of
roasted
barley
nearly
perfect
for
an
irish
stout
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
beer
pours
to
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
medium
sized
darker
tan
head
that
falls
away
pretty
quickly
but
does
leave
some
nice
lacing
has
a
nice
smell
of
roastedslightly
burnt
malts
that
give
off
some
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
very
inviting
the
taste
is
very
good
burnt
flavors
come
out
and
mix
in
real
nice
with
chocolate
coffee
maybe
some
caramel
and
a
break
at
the
tail
end
of
hops
which
wrap
things
up
well
possesses
a
dry
feel
with
some
good
carbonation
that
tingles
the
tongue
this
is
a
very
nice
offering
from
grittys
i
am
glad
to
have
finally
given
it
a
try
and
will
look
for
it
in
the
future
kinda
meh
about
this
one
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
although
i
could
see
this
being
quite
sessionable
for
some
people
i
distinctly
remember
the
first
draught
pint
of
black
fly
i
had
years
ago
it
was
at
the
brewpub
in
portland
and
it
was
served
at
cellar
temp
on
a
warm
summer
day
it
was
the
most
delicious
beer
i
had
ever
tasted
this
bottle
doesnt
quite
have
that
magic
but
it
stands
up
to
the
memory
well
enough
grittys
still
makes
a
hell
of
a
good
stout
and
at
4
10
abv
its
a
session
beer
to
boot
still
one
of
my
favorites
i
thought
this
was
an
american
stout
until
i
looked
on
here
to
see
its
a
irish
stout
changes
things
a
bit
i
gave
it
better
marks
is
light
of
this
overall
a
very
nice
dry
stout
a
very
drinkable
treat
on
st
patricks
day
i
will
buy
again

it
was
a
totally
different
experience
this

aroma
of
roasted

very
clean

mellow

found
this

just
a
robust

smokey

mouthfeel

score

pours
black
with
an
amazingly
huge
head
now
im
not
the
most
patient
pourer
in
the
world
but
i
cant
seem
to
pour
this
one
into
a
small
glass
without
over
half
of
it
being
head
quite
funny
actually
i
dont
drink
much
stout
so
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
malt
aroma
is
fairly
malty
and
leaves
some
of
the
head
on
my
nose
nice
earthy
flavour
with
some
coffee
aftertaste
not
bad
22
oz

with
no
freshness
date
to
speak
of
opaque
black
body
with

thick
tan
head
that
dissipates
a
tad
quickly
and
leaves
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
smells
mostly
hoppy
with
some
roast
bitter
anyways
hops
dominate
the
flavor
while
roast
or
burnt
malt
play
a
big
role
too
flavor
is
not
overwealmingly
strong
not
watery
per
se
but
not
as
robust
as
some
porters
and
stouts
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
than
i
generally
like
in
a
stout
fairly
heavybodied
its
an
okay
beer
overall
though
worthwhile
to
try
and
have
once
in
a
while
from
a
very
worthwhile
brewery
to
be
fair
the
bottle
might
be
a
little
old
though
not
expired
poured
a
huge
thick
beige

in
color
has
a
balanced
aroma
of
maltsroasted
grainsand
hops
leaves
a
bitter
very
dry
coffee
like
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
foamy
and
not
what
i
like
in
a
stout
full
bodied
with
definate
coffee
and
slight
chocolate
taste
a
very
impressive
offering
from
grittys
being
so
dry
on
the
finish
drinkability
might
be
an
issue
with
these
nicely
carbonated
gritty
mcduffs
black
fly
stout
is
a
very
enjoyable
version
of
an
irish
dry
stout
i
must
confess
that
initially
i
was
not
enthralled
from
my
first
exposure
however
this
is
worthy
of
giving
a
go
as
subsequent
samplings
perhaps
unintentional
aging
is
a
factor
here
it
pours
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
monster
sized
head
the
smell
is
malty
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
slight
burnt
coffee
bittering
it
has
a
nice
dry
mouthfeel
indeed
a
nicely
drinkable
stout
this
is
a
lightweight
stout
thats
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
to
boot
does
not
lack
in
good
stout
flavors
though
very
sweet
brew
with
a
cafe
mocha
and
vanilla
flavor
taking
over
though
it
would
be
described
as
creamy
it
wasnt
hearty
or
chewy
nice
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
evening
it
came
off
as
a
sweeter
guinness
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
expected
overall
not
bad
just
a
little
more
sweet
and
not
with
as
much
bite
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
favorite
style
either
still
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
beers
i
have
been
drinking
lately
this
was
a
black
black
color
with
a
thick
coffeecolored
head
it
had
a
predominately
coffee
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
roasted
grain
taste
was
all
coffee
but
maybe
a
little
chocolate
snuck
in
i
thought
it
was
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
still
very
drinkable
if
you
like
stout
youll
like
this
beer
if
youre
not
a
big
stout
fan
forget
it
d
high
if
you
like
this
kind
which
i
do
redtinged
darkness
nearly
black
thin
offwhite
head
serious
roast
in
the
nose
like
coffee
grounds
also
a
sharp
slightly
sour
tang
this
reminds
me
of
mcneills
brews
probably
because
i
just
had
one
before
this
but
it
has
that
same
slightly
sour
taste
off
the
bat
that
is
intense
when
cold
slightly
annoying
bu
more
subdued
when
warm
this
also
has
a
huge
dark
ash
flavor
like
licking
a
campfire
rather
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
and
not
particularly
exciting
enough
to
invite
another
pint
a
bit
onedimensional
this
was
an
enjoyable
and
sessionable
stout
had
several
of
these
over
st
pats
day
and
can
easily
see
this
as
my
beer
of
choice
on
that
and
other
occasions
an
enjoyable
new
england
beer
a
very
good
traditional
stout
but
falls
short
of
being
a
great
one
comments
this
was
an
average
stout
but
not
my
favorite
the
high
carbonation
thin
watery
body
makes
for
a
slightly
different
twist
on
a
regular
stout
i
did
like
the
flavor
drinkability
but
would
choose
a
smoother
less
carbonated
stout
in
the
future
if
looking
for
a
beer
in
this
style
a
pleasant
tasting
dry
stout
the
carbonation
is
overpowering
and
takes
away
from
some
of
this
stouts
true
flavors
pours
a
redtinged
black
with
a
lasting
brown
head
decent
amount
of
lace
faint
dark
malt
aroma
mild
flavor
of
dark
malt
and
a
subtle
hint
of
coffee
unfortunately
thin
body
somewhat
watery
once
again
an
odd
metallic
and
grain
hull
aftertaste
i
dont
find
this
to
be
a
very
good
beer
but
i
suppose
it
would
be
drinkable
but
the
wateriness
would
get
to
me
pretty
quickly
meh
not
my
favorite
stout
ever
it
was
very
pretty
sooo
dark
and
great
head
and
lacing
but
that
was
about
the
only
thing
i
really
enjoyed
here
the
smell
had
coffee
and
woodyness
going
on
but
nothing
very
complex
taste
was
more
coffee
some
biscuit
and
something
i
really
didnt
dig
almost
a
rootbeer
gone
bad
flavor
mouthfeel
was
way
too
watery
and
thin
just
not
my
favorite
id
like
to
try
it
on
draft
though
dark
and
opaque
pours
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
pretty
good
head
retention
roasted
malt
aroma
with
some
chocolate
toffee
a
little
nutty
too
malty
in
flavor
chocolatey
hints
of
toffee
and
a
mild
background
bitterness
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
with
pretty
good
carbonation
heres
a
real
fun
one
pours
as
black
as
night
with
a
semichocolatey
smell
and
taste
its
so
dark
and
thick
that
you
cant
see
through
it
at
all
it
has
a
rich
full
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
all
things
considered
this
is
a
stout
that
you
can
put
down
a
lot
of
without
it
becoming
a
problem
very
good
but
kinda
hard
to
find
this
beer
is
definitely
superior
on
draught
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
at
the
pub
when
living
me
in
the
90s
but
from
the
bottle
it
didnt
have
the
same
complexity
of
flavor
or
creamy
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
the
abundance
of
carbonation
may
have
really
thrown
things
off
but
his
is
still
a
tasty
dry
stout
certainly
more
complex
than
the
most
common
irish
versions
of
the
sample
ive
tried
ill
try
to
review
it
on
draught
the
next
time
im
in
me
pours
a
deep
dark
inky
black
topped
by
a
small
khakicolored
head
aroma
of
rich
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
of
espresso
mediumbodied
for
a
stout
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
roasted
malt
is
the
main
component
of
the
palate
balanced
by
a
nice
but
subdued
hop
profile
accented
by
espresso
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
of
something
akin
to
horlicks
malt
finishes
dry
and
slightly
smoky
a
nice
easydrinking
stout
brewed
at
one
of
the
friendliest
places
i
visited
in
maine
good
initial
head

black
lace
smoke
and
coffee
aroma
taste
of
wood
smoke
coffee
chocolate
malta
spot
of
fuitiness
drying
finish
licorice
on
aftertaste
good
for
its
style
well
malted
but
in
a
word
balanced
and
very
quaffable
medium
mouthfeel
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
tint
with
a
finger
and
a
half
brown
head
that
leaves
an
abundance
of
lace
as
it
goes
down
smells
roasty
chocolatey
smokey
goodness
it
also
smelled
kind
of
like
chalk
dust
to
me
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
good
fizzz
leaves
an
irish
cream
taste
in
your
mouth
with
highlights
of
chocolate
caramel
and
roated
malts
very
drinkable
stoutcould
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
probably
grittys
best
beer
as
the
malt
notes
hide
the
butteryness
an
ink
black
color
with
a
massive
three
finger
head
that
lasts
a
nice
coffee
smell
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
mixed
in
the
taste
is
a
drycoffeechocolateand
cola
like
flavor
it
has
a
slight
hickory
smokieness
to
start
and
ends
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
this
has
a
medium
feela
little
light
for
my
tastebut
not
bad
this
is
a
good
offerring
from
grittys
and
im
sure
ill
have
more
of
this
and
heck
even
with
that
flavor
issue
im
still
gonna
say
that
its
highly
drinkable
under
certain
circumstances
so
hey
watch
your
circumstances
and
enjoy
a
pint
cheers
medium
heavy
in
body
crisp
at
the
start
the
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
the
roasted
malt
and
bitter
chocolate
linger
long
on
the
tongue
superb
drinkability
definitely
one
to
seek
out
very
rich
and
easy
going
down
very
good

brew
heavenly
dry

my
preferred

with
a
frothy

head
that
held
well
and
laced
a
ton
of

chocolate
on

some

some

not
much
coffee
on
the
nose
to
me
but
plenty
of
roaster
maltscoffeecocoa
on
the
tongue
very
smooth
and
agreeable
allaround
nicely
drinkable
it
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
3
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
sparse
coating
over
top
a
little
too
much
head
on
the
pour
but
still
where
i
want
it
after
all
is
done
the
nose
is
very
nice
and
roasty
good
burnt
malts
come
through
light
chocolate
and
coffee
also
comes
through
i
like
it
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
bold
than
the
nose
there
are
burnt
malt
notes
coffee
bitterness
coming
through
it
finishes
nice
and
dry
good
flavor
and
a
nice
finish
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
i
had
a
bit
earlier
this
week
and
was
nit
sure
but
this
bottle
has
me
hooked
very
good
beer
smooth
and
enjoyable
a
good
american
attempt
of
an
irish
stout
looks
dark
black
with
an
off
white
head
that
lasts
low
carbonation
and
rich
looking
smells
lightly
malty
with
caramel
roasted
toasted
and
chocolate
malts
no
hop
aroma
tartness
that
is
associated
with
cherries
tastes
largely
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
malt
sweet
caramel
malts
in
the
background
firm
medium
body
holds
on
til
the
finish
finishes
dry
and
crisp
a
creamy
beer
even
without
the
nitro
flavors
give
way
to
carcoal
like
finish
makes
this
beer
a
little
abrupt
but
still
a
good
beer
awesome
balanced
taste
notes
of
coffee
caramel
cream
spicy
bittering
hop
full
bodied
with
a
slightly
high
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
similar
to
unsweetened
cocoa
this
truly
makes
up
for
the
initial
impression
id
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
loves
the
style
and
even
those
who
arent
the
smell
is
milk
chocolatey
toasted
malt
and
citrus
rind
the
taste
is
a
dark
roast
malt
flavor
it
fills
out
the
profile
but
keeps
a
good
balance
for
the
style
there
is
again
milk
chocolate
citrus
banana
mouthfeel
clean
dry
with
an
abrupt
finish
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
more
of
these
ontap
gritty
mcduffs
portland
me
a
dark
nearly
opaque
brew
this
one
is
with
a
nice
tankhaki
head
on
top
aromas
are
very
buttery
and
english
toffee
like
as
well
roasted
malts
are
in
there
and
sweet
coffee
makes
an
appearance
as
well
but
where
are
the
hops
hidin
you
may
ask
i
dunno
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
than
the
aromas
as
some
fersh
hops
are
found
in
the
back
of
this
brew
the
malt
backbone
is
solidly
great
and
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
work
well
with
this
here
yeast
and
these
diacetyl
flavors
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
but
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
a
nice
one
from
grittys
thanks
to
sulldaddy
for
this
one
obtained
march
2005
and
consumed
about
a
week
later
bottled
march
2005
pours
a
ridiculous
nine
maybe
ten
finger
deadbrown
head
over
a
pitch
black
liquid
smells
of
almost
nothing
water
wtf
this
isnt
shaping
up
very
good
very
gentle
roast
and
a
vegetable
that
is
likely
the
hops
immediate
taste
is
lightly
sugary
with
light
roast
coming
in
shortly
thereafter
as
the
swallow
starts
i
get
some
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
molasses
hops
rise
in
the
aftertaste
with
an
oily
aromatic
fuggles
quality
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
i
would
like
which
is
surprising
as
i
would
have
expect
all
the
carbonation
to
have
blown
out
with
the
head
i
got
a
light
cherry
sour
sits
on
my
tongue
afterward
in
an
interesting
twist
too
bad
the
bottle
was
way
overcarbonated
i
only
got
a
half
a
beer
out
of
it
and
cant
review
any
more
after
a
bad
start
it
the
mix
of
flavors
was
getting
interesting
the
smell
has
changed
and
there
is
noticable
chocolate
molasses
and
coffee
to
be
gleaned
from
my
empty
glass
a
very
pleasant
stout
i
could
easily
drink
this
one
all
night
carbonation
is
great
taste
is
fantastic
i
wish
irish
pubs
would
serve
this
instead
of
guinness
once
i
get
beyond
what
my
be
a
fluke
and
an
off
batch
of
this
beer
i
like
it
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
this
is
a
nice
northern
new
england
version
of
an
irish
dry
stout
with
the
creamy
diacetyl
and
all
inky
black
color
with
a
pleasant
creamy
off
white
head
mild
roast
hop
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
very
subtle
layers
of
roast
malt
a
little
chocolate
backed
by
a
mild
bitterness
creamy
smooth
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
subtle
beer
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
style
but
the
soft
flavors
are
a
little
too
tame
for
me
black
perfection
with
a
fingers
worth
of
milk
chocolate
cream
on
top
sweet
chocolate
aroma
wonderful
texture
silky
smooth
and
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
with
no
burnt
or
smoky
tones
slight
citrus
hops
one
of
those
beers
that
you
know
youre
going
to
have
two
at
the
first
sip
a
nice
stout
from
the
grittys
folks
it
pours
a
damn
near
black
colour
with
a
moderate
tan
head
that
leaves
only
minimal
residue
on
the
glass
which
was
a
bit
perplexing
to
me
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
coffee
as
well
the
flavour
incorporates
everything
listed
above
into
a
creamy
goodness
that
is
spot
on
in
terms
of
balance
chocolate
and
malt
mix
evenly
throughout
with
the
start
being
a
bit
sweeter
and
the
finish
holding
a
touch
of
hop
and
coffee
for
a
dry
flavour
that
hits
the
spot
the
fullness
and
creaminess
of
this
brew
are
simply
outstanding
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
recommended
this
is
one
of
the
most
wellbalanced
stouts
ive
come
across
poured
a
delightful
inky
black
with
a
mocha
colored
head
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
nicely
roasted
malt
flavors
that
retained
a
nice
fresh
aspect
firm
bittering
at
the
finish
juxteposed
against
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
almost
but
not
quite
ventured
into
sweet
stout
territory
exceptional
drinkability
one
of
those
beers
that
seems
to
just
evaporate
from
the
glass
thanks
to
far333
for
this
gem
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
and
yes
i
know
the
nitrotap
probably
minused
25
or
more
of
the
flavor
but
big
deal
it
was
one
beer
pour
was
very
very
dark
rosy
tones
on
the
bottom
of
the
pint
13
inch
of
thick
tan
foam
on
top
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
and
dark
chocolate
notes
trying
to
decide
if
its
60
or
70
cocoa
solids
ha
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
thin
beer
is
all
about
the
roasted
finish
with
alcohol
dryness
coming
in
at
the
very
end
nice
to
try
it
this
way
has
a
sweet
aroma
to
it
with
roated
barley
character
that
you
would
typically
find
in
a
dry
stout
but
does
have
a
subtle
hop
aroma
smooth
and
nicley
balanced
very
excellent
marriage
between
the
roasted
barley
and
hops
are
barely
noticable
very
well
brewed
and
very
drinkable
smooth
and
tasty
with
very
good
drinkability
a
must
try
american
dry
stout
drinkability
like
nina
simone
i
need
a
little
sugar
in
my
bowl
this
was
enjoyable
overall
but
im
looking
for
something
else
in
a
stout
namely
bittersweetness
and
roasted
malts
the
color
of
this
beer
is
dark
brownnearly
ink
black
i
had
a
big
light
browndark
beige
head
there
was
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
licorice
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
ended
with
a
smooth
roasted
bitterness
it
seemed
kind
of
watery
on
the
tongue
and
there
was
a
prickely
carbonation
sensation
that
was
a
little
more
than
i
would
have
liked
it
finishes
dry
and
clean
thanks
to
pbrian
for
this
addition
poured
an
opaque
deep
brownish
black
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
with
a
small
toffeecolored
head
which
was
gone
within
minutes
sparse
lace
present
during
the
drinking
experience
essences
of
coffee
and
burnt
grain
make
their
aromas
known
delicately
no
overpowering
smells
here
taste
continues
along
the
same
lines
with
bitterness
entering
the
flavor
equation
late
and
then
closes
out
with
a
heightening
of
the
initial
flavors
drinkability
gets
an
upswing
because
it
seems
not
as
hearty
as
some
of
the
other
brews
in
its
style
an
acceptable
representation
of
the
style
but
not
the
top
of
the
heap
the
dark
black
beer
had
a
hint
of
red
if
the
light
caught
it
just
right
its
head
was
a
light
brown
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
which
was
also
the
primary
flavor
the
flavor
was
incredibly
rich
with
strong
coffee
notes
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
only
drawback
was
its
relative
lack
of
complexity
its
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
an
all
around
above
average
stout
nice
dark
color
with
a
chunky
head
and
nice
lacing
smell
was
smoky
taste
was
well
rounded
with
smoky
undertones
aftertaste
was
slightly
bitter
in
a
nice
way
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
drinkable
quality
this
brew
is
a
good
representation
of
the
category
recommend
trying
my
wife
actually
drank
this
while
there
in
portland
and
i
tasted
a
little
o
it
and
here
is
what
i
got
from
it
pours
a
deep
black
with
red
highlights
showing
thru
a
deep
almond
colored
light
creamy
head
i
noticed
somebitterness
in
the
aroma
with
some
dark
roast
coffeeflavor
is
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
some
earthiness
with
that
bitterness
i
got
in
the
aroma
popping
up
in
the
finish
all
in
all
seemed
to
be
a
pretty
solid
stout
the
body
was
black
with
ruby
edges
i
was
getting
smoke
out
the
wazoo
with
this
beer
but
i
dont
see
any
mention
of
smoke
elsewhere
but
i
swear
it
was
there
a
good
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
little
roast
support
it
im
not
big
on
the
smoke
but
it
wasnt
quite
too
much
for
this
beer
a
very
nice
stout
probably
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
nitro
tap
black
as
night
with
superb
lacing
and
stick
sampled
at
grittys
in
freeport
great
place
for
a
beer
by
the
way
i
loved
the
nitro
head
with
its
luxuriously
creamy
head
aromas
included
bitter
and
sweet
with
chocolate
and
espresso
dominating
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
oh
so
silky
due
to
the
nitro
tapage
package
the
carbonation
was
subdued
and
done
just
right
the
taste
was
the
clincher
in
this
one
awesome
flavors
featuring
again
bittersweet
chocolate
tang
hop
and
a
a
sublime
roasted
malt
character
this
was
an
easy
to
enjoy
stout
and
one
not
pass
up
if
you
find
it
im
a
little
surprised
to
see
this
one
ranked
above
grittys
others
the
best
bitter
and
best
brown
really
rocked
my
socks
off
but
this
one
seemed
a
little
bland
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
plain
jane
stouts
but
cmon
dude
seriously
seriously
gritty
might
have
made
a
good
stout
for
the
stout
lover
but
not
for
the
ambidextrous
beer
drinker
hits
the
tongue
with
bitter
roasted
malt
fades
to
smooth
chocolately
flavor
mediumheavy
body
with
that
burnt
malt
lingering
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
drinkable
and
affordable
a
solid
local
stout
pours
a
black

a
tan
head
good
roasty
burnt
style
flavors
with
an
underlying
fruity
stout
feel
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
solid
balance
this
would
be
a
real
treat
on
creamy
nitro
but
still
quite
nice
in
the
bottle
one
of
the
better
stouts
available
around

just
wonderful

is
what
youd
expect
from
a
stout
thick

hearty
highly
drinkable
the
draught
version
is
definitely
superior
to
the
bottle
imho
a
must
drink
brew
when
you
can
get

that

i

that

mouth
the
flavor
starts
dry
with
a
distinct
burnt
currant
fruitiness
that
mellows
into
more
caramel
chocolate
and
leftontheburnertoolong
coffee
notes
before
finishing
with
a
splash
of
leafy
hop
flavor
and
a
long
lasting
burnt
malt
character
similar
to
black
malt
although
probably
from
very
dark
british
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
throughout
the
glass
the
combination
of
the
lightly
tart
fruitiness
followed
by
the
acrid
roastiness
and
long
dull
finish
becomes
quite
endearing
very
unique
probably
a
bit
too
much
flavor
to
make
it
a
good
session
brew
but
definitely
interesting
and
rich
enough
to
make
a
pint
last
for
alot
longer
than
usual
id
love
to
taste
this
caskconditioned
on
handpump
i
will
thank
pbrian
for
the
sample
nonethless
i
will
always
be
willing
to
try
anything
that
ive
never
tried
before
and
pbrian
helped
my
cause
by
sending
me
this
beer
a
great
stout
and
considering
my
location
i
really
need
to
remember
to
pick
this
fine
beer
up
more
often
if
you
can
ever
get
it
on
a
nitro
tap
it
is
head
and
shoulders
above
guinness
a
beauty
in
the
glass
deep
dark
midnight
black
great
big
fissy
beige
head
fades
fast
but
circles
the
glass
nicely
smells
are
balanced
and
not
overwheming
combinations
of
coffee
chocolate
and
just
enough
bitter
roasted
finish
taste
is
even
and
smooth
subltle
coffess
undertones
slighltly
chocolate
perfect
crisp
dry
hop
finish
no
chalk
like
slimy
aftertaste
very
balanced
and
flavorful
one
of
my
new
alltime
favorites
i
carried
a
couple
home
from
my
summer
trip
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
pours
black
as
night
with
a
good
brown
head
that
subsides
to
a
nice
film
with
a
great
lace
the
brew
has
strong
coffee
aromas
with
solid
roasted
maltchocolate
characteristics
great
bittersweet
chocolate
characteristics
mix
well
with
the
coffe
and
roasted
flavors
in
this
brew
and
make
it
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
flavors
and
the
roastedburnt
malt
leaves
a
nice
lingering
finish
behind
definitely
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
dont
think
they
know
hot
to
make
bad
beer
in
maine
thanks
to
the
bierman
for
this
sample
i
enjoyed
this
stout
pours
with
little
head
but
as
with
all
stouts
looks
great
in
the
glass
i
liked
the
malt
to
hop
balance
in
this
one
the
hops
were
there
but
were
not
overpowering
a
little
lighter
than
bells
kzoo
stout
but
a
nice
offering
overall
this
is
a
great
dry
stout
black
with
tan
head
chocolatecoffee
aromas
nice
burnt
malt
flavors
nicely
balanced
with
a
dose
of
hop
bitterness
finishes
dry
and
light
bodied
perfect
for
enticing
you
into
another
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
i
wish
i
grabbed
more
than
two
notes
one
of
the
top
stouts
brewed
in
the
us
very
well
balanced
and
is
even
more
heavenly
on
nitrotap
certainly
a
stout
lovers
stout
c
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
12
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
cocoa
nibs
and
slight
coffee
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
slightly
sour
dark
fruit
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
but
pretty
thin
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
irish
style
stout
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lacking
in
my
opinion
o
not
impressed
with
this
stout
and
i
was
excited
to
try
this
unrefined
and
sloppy
smell
was
decent
but
taste
was
not
enjoyed
o
a
solid
beer
to
style
nothing
more
price
is
good
for
a
drinkable
pint
this
would
be
a
good
choice
o
not
a
bad
stout
goes
down
pretty
easy
served
from
bottle
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cream
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
cream
earth
and
subtle
toasted
malt
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
this
brew
really
didnt
wow
in
any
way
but
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
one
felt
to
have
more
of
a
toasted
flavor
to
it
as
compared
to
roastiness
which
is
typical
in
most
brews
this
was
a
welcomed
change
worth
trying
if
you
have
not
had
it
before
and
like
the
style
or
are
just
curious
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
and
somewhat
interesting
to
consider
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
may
not
score
well
on
any
one
category
while
reviewing
but
it
just
goes
down
way
too
easily
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
but
nothing
really
stands
out
its
lacking
just
a
bit
of
quality
in
all
areas
but
it
tastes
good
enough
to
easily
enjoy
o
this
is
a
nice
irish
dry
stout
another
solid
brew
from
lakefront
o
get
guinness
outta
the
way
snake
chaser
is
clearly
a
better
irish
stout
locking
in
superior
flavor
with
smooth
drinkability
one
better
keep
track
of
how
many
pints
of
this
they
put
down
on
st
pattys
day
if
at
all
possibly
shoot
for
a
lakefront
tour
and
try
this
on
the
nitro
tap
the
mouth
feel
is
decent
it
could
be
a
little
less
filmy
but
other
than
that
fine
i
enjoyed
this
offering
and
would
certainly
pick
it
up
again
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
adequate
head
a
bit
thin
on
the
lacing
smokey
malt
aroma
a
bit
of
bacon
in
there
as
well
taste
is
smokey
a
bit
of
playdough
with
bacon
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
pretty
light
on
the
carbonation
for
the
style
i
had
low
expecations
with
this
one
but
this
was
actually
better
than
id
figured
not
quite
as
inyourface
as
american
styled
stouts
but
more
of
a
irish
sessionable
stout
if
this
isnt
a
bad
bottle
then
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
the
nose
is
really
quite
nice
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
fails
to
live
up
to
it
ill
pass
on
this
one
poured
dark
brown
opaque
with
a
half
finger
of
tan
head
that
faded
quickly
with
zero
lacing
smells
malty
heavily
roasted
some
grain
as
well
taste
was
sour
but
not
tart
hard
to
place
underripe
dark
fruit
perhaps
sour
plums
roasted
malt
dry
mouthfeel
was
creamy
but
quite
dry
roasted
elements
linger
on
the
finish
the
first
few
sips
were
okay
but
it
got
annoying
after
a
while
o
im
a
pretty
big
fan
of
lakefront
brewery
but
this
is
likely
the
last
time
i
drink
me
some
snake
chaser
dark
brown
tanned
head
is
quite
thin
and
leaves
almost
no
lace
aroma
is
super
clean
with
notes
of
brown
malt
and
brewing
salts
slight
medicinal
component
flavor
finally
includes
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
but
no
more
still
fairly
strong
aspirin
taste
happily
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
this
is
easy
to
drink
if
seriously
uninteresting
even
more
of
a
lightweight
than
your
typical
irish
stout
bitterwseet
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
a
very
good
taste
for
the
style
in
a
thin
beer
it
worked
well
for
me
as
a
summer
stout
winter
comes
i
cannot
have
this
o
although
not
bold
or
exciting
this
is
a
really
well
put
together
stout
that
i
highly
recommend
great
session
stout
d
decent
level
of
drinkability
wouldnt
turn
down
a
second
and
actually
started
liking
this
the
more
i
continued
to
drink
it
grows
on
you
overall
a
very
well
done
beer
maybe
a
touch
sweet
or
creamy
for
exactly
this
style
but
i
still
like
it
a
true
to
style
irish
stout
from
good
ol
lakefront
in
brewaukee
wi
although
it
pours
a
tad
thin
still
very
appealing
with
great
aromatic
qualities
for
a
lighter
body
some
great
tones
of
roast
malts
mild
hops
coco
coffee
and
a
hint
of
mint
very
enjoyable
dry
stout
from
lakefront
overall
i
wasnt
preparing
for
much
from
this
beer
and
thats
basically
what
i
got
the
flavors
are
too
muddled
and
seem
off
in
general
not
worth
seeking
out
and
im
not
sure
id
have
a
glass
even
if
offered
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
irish
stout
ive
has
this
beer
a
million
times
at
the
brewery
yet
this
was
my
first
time
in
a
bottle
d
overall
decent
beer
a
little
too
much
carbonation
to
keep
drinking
more
a
good
mix
of
hops
and
sweetness
in
the
initial
taste
both
will
subside
throughout
the
bottle
not
complex
gets
easier
to
drink
could
be
called
watered
down
sure
but
its
not
pretentious
and
it
has
still
the
ample
body
to
make
up
for
the
backslide
downbottle
great
price
on
these
the
body
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
carbonation
level
is
moderate
id
like
a
bit
more
chew
to
this
this
has
great
flavor
though
nice
bittersweet
chocolate
a
little
char
in
the
middle
and
finishes
dry
and
slightly
tart
i
for
one
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
was
a
great
beer
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
clear
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
red
highlights
and
a
big
creamy
head
that
hangs
around
a
long
time
with
very
good
lacing
that
slides
back
into
the
glass
slight
roasted
malt
aroma
burnt
malt
taste
with
small
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
slight
sour
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
not
bad
overall
i
cant
drink
more
than
one
of
these
but
i
dont
know
if
this
is
because
of
a
bad
bottle
or
if
this
is
how
this
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
either
way
id
like
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
it
was
in
fact
a
bad
beer
or
if
this
is
how
this
one
is
made
looking
back
on
other
reviews
it
seems
that
others
are
enjoying
the
same
conundrum
if
you
want
an
interesting
flavor
experience
pick
it
up
and
see
if
its
a
sour
stout
or
an
infected
stout
pours
black
in
color
with
some
reddish
brown
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
nicely
tanned
head
more
than
2
fingers
strong
and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
a
burnt
grain
mixture
with
some
chocolate
coffee
smoke
and
mild
citrus
and
metallic
twang
in
the
finish
taste
is
metallic
with
quite
a
solid
citrus
presence
from
the
hops
also
picking
up
on
yeast
in
the
taste
along
with
some
smoke
character
the
taste
is
actually
a
disappointment
from
what
the
nose
led
on
most
of
the
characteristics
of
the
aroma
only
show
up
in
a
mild
way
in
the
lingering
finish
of
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
no
head
and
therefore
no
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
chocolate
slight
grass
and
some
earthy
nut
fits
the
style
of
an
irish
dry
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
watery
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
and
slight
toffee
overall
not
very
complex
watery
and
poor
appearance
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
malts
taste
is
malty
with
some
notes
of
chocolate
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
pours
a
five
finger
light
brown
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
totally
black
color
no
highlights
light
chocolate
nose
light
carbonation
and
mediumheavy
bodied
flavor
is
a
medicinal
chocolate
unusual
expecting
a
dry
stout
like
guinness
1
80
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
ok
drinkable
but
overall
it
feels
more
like
some
pallid
offering
from
a
macro
brewer
than
something
produced
by
a
craft
brewer
served
ontap
at
lakefront
brewery
in
milwaukee
wi
pours
a
black
body
with
a
tight
dark
khaki
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
cream
medium
bodied
with
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
and
a
bit
of
creamy
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
irish
stouts
i
wonder
how
it
would
taste
on
a
nitrotap
while
easy
to
drink
once
one
overcomes
the
sweetness
this
beer
simply
falls
below
the
bar
given
all
the
great
session
beers
out
there
this
one
gets
chalked
up
as
a
nice
try
drainpour
i
like
this
brew
and
i
like
the
brewer
even
better
even
if
youve
never
been
lucky
enough
to
try
this
serpent
i
suggest
you
better
get
to
milwaukee
and
treat
yourself
to
a
brewery
tour
the
tour
they
offer
will
undoubtedly
be
at
the
top
of
your
tour
list
drinkability
this
may
not
have
been
the
freshest
sample
so
i
have
marked
it
up
a
bit
higher
than
what
i
am
tasting
nevertheless
i
suspect
this
is
a
rather
unremarkable
attempt
at
the
style
very
interesting
combination
of
flavors
but
i
like
it
this
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
moderately
roasty
and
a
bit
ashy
the
flavor
is
moderately
roasty
with
a
pronounced
minerallike
flavor
and
finish
the
beer
finishes
rather
dry
with
a
bit
of
an
acidic
bite
the
body
is
medium
as
is
carbonation
overall
i
think
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
misses
the
mark
with
distracting
minerallike
flavor
and
acidic
bite
all
in
all
a
nice
enjoyable
stout
md
light
to
medium
bodied
a
touch
thinner
than
i
like
easy
drinking
but
not
an
interesting
beer
at
all
drinkability
a
bit
forgettable
a
passable
dry
stout
i
suppose
but
it
comes
up
far
far
short
in
overall
character
and
complexities
dark
brown
no
head
and
no
lacing
served
in
a
guinness
pint
aroma
of
dry
chocolate
and
light
roastiness
with
a
hint
of
caramel
flavor
is
definitely
on
the
dryer
side
with
notes
of
cola
grape
chocolate
and
light
caramel
body
needs
some
imporving
carbonation
is
very
light
not
a
bad
dry
irish
stout
per
se
but
not
very
good
either
this
was
a
nasty
overpowering
smokey
harsh
beer
that
i
would
not
get
near
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
dark
brown
almost
oil
like
consistency
the
head
is
light
brown
and
about
12
inch
think
but
doesnt
last
long
and
doesnt
leave
much
of
a
cap
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
toffee
yeast
and
some
mild
roasted
malts
there
is
a
burnt
smell
that
lingers
the
taste
is
over
powered
with
that
same
burnt
smell
there
is
a
decent
creamy
consistency
and
the
carbonation
is
good
but
something
is
off
about
this
brew
the
taste
doesnt
quite
match
the
style
a
little
more
sweetness
would
balance
it
out
better
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
not
my
favorite
irish
stout
but
a
decent
one
nonetheless
low
alcohol
and
good
flavor
make
this
a
good
session
choice
after
your
palate
is
deadened
to
the
sourness
this
one
goes
down
easy
id
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
cheers
to
lakefront
another
great
beer
a
great
way
to
conclude
the
tour
definately
recommend
it
this
is
a
thick
beer
but
i
love
thick
beers
so
i
could
easily
put
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
if
you
fill
up
easy
or
like
lighter
beers
this
wouldnt
be
for
you
obviously
the
color
is
dark
amber
with
a
tint
of
red
the
nose
is
a
nice
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
toffee
and
coffee
notes
of
hops
and
yeast
the
taste
is
sorta
muted
the
nose
provided
more
than
the
taste
the
beer
seem
watery
and
faint
a
clean
and
easy
finish
overall
it
is
okay
i
let
it
warm
quite
a
bit
thining
maybe
the
cold
was
causing
this
there
was
some
improvement
but
not
even
closing
to
making
this
a
tasty
beer
this
one
became
a
drain
pour
after
about
4
ounces
snake
chaser
looks
pretty
tasty
as
the
solidly
black
body
sits
below
a
tan
head
the
aromas
are
chocolate
espresso
and
a
good
roastiness
the
taste
is
pleasing
with
a
good
charred
character
dark
bitter
chocolate
slight
hop
bittering
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
slightly
lighter
than
i
would
appreciate
in
this
beer
for
a
good
sessionable
irish
stout
this
will
do
snake
chaser
is
nothing
to
rave
about
but
worth
a
try
beware
of
this
batch
if
you
come
upon
it
unless
you
want
something
really
different
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
not
bad
overall
the
taste
is
weakest
quality
and
is
mostly
turned
plums
vinegar
steak
sauce
and
coffee
with
an
extemely
faint
hint
of
choclate
its
very
sour
the
feel
is
slightly
silky
and
pretty
good
in
the
end
this
is
onesided
and
unpleasant
almost
undrinkable
to
me
pours
an
inky
black
color
with
a
good
coarse
head
that
eventually
settles
to
a
fine
ring
smells
of
roasted
light
coffee
light
mouth
feel
good
roastedness
light
to
little
hop
presence
good
representation
of
the
style
aftertaste
is
okay
wish
i
could
say
more
dont
drink
and
review
a
12oz
bottle
with
bottled
1st
week
of
march
on
the
label
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
black
in
color
with
a
mediumsized
tan
head
tiny
bit
of
lacing
it
had
a
predominately
coffee
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
taste
followed
aroma
although
i
got
more
of
a
bittersweet
chocolate
sense
in
the
taste
fairly
dry
nice
enough
beer
my
hopes
got
dashed
on
this
one
id
give
it
another
try
in
the
future
to
see
if
the
taste
was
from
some
type
of
oxidation
but
i
think
this
just
isnt
my
cup
of
stout
what
seemed
like
a
promising
brew
will
become
a
drain
pour
after
i
complete
this
review
possibly
a
bad
bottle
but
definitely
not
an
old
one
disappointing
12oz
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
an
opaque
black
body
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
smells
roasty
with
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
a
suggestion
of
date
tastes
roasty
bakers
chocolate
and
coffee
along
with
nut
toward
the
finish
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
that
helps
keep
this
an
easy
drinker
one
of
the
tastiest
dry
stouts
ive
had
thus
far
im
impressed
d
a
good
irish
stout
its
balance
is
the
key
and
will
make
this
beer
more
sessionable
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
cant
say
ill
be
searching
it
out
again
anytime
soon
id
recommend
it
to
try
but
i
believe
youll
come
to
the
same
conclusion
paired
nice
with
some
gruyere
though
a
miss
but
not
by
much
cant
recommend
drinkability
is
great
this
is
not
a
heavy
brew
nor
is
it
overpowering
the
flavors
may
be
too
bold
for
certain
drinkers
but
fans
of
the
style
can
rejoice
in
a
pint
of
snake
chaser
another
classic
from
lakefront
cheers
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
just
not
one
of
my
favorite
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
not
really
to
my
taste
a
little
too
one
dimensional
with
respect
to
the
roast
flavors
not
at
the
top
of
my
dry
stout
list
very
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
nice
session

the
snake
chaser
irish
stout
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
its
tightly
formed
tan
head
sits
on
top
of
a
deep
dark
brown
body
it
looks
like
something
familiar
but
the
taste
is
much
less
conventional
than
i
expected
i
couldnt
pick
up
much
off
the
nose
both
bottles
that
i
sampled
gave
off
only
an
occasional
whiff
of
roasted
malt
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
moderate
dose
of
fine
carbonation
that
adds
to
the
balance
of
this
beer
initial
light
roasted
malt
flavors
are
quickly
subdued
by
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
acidity
coffee
with
a
dash
of
unsweetened
chocolate
combines
with
a
mostly
dry
finish
i
found
this
stout
easy
to
drink
and
would
expect
this
to
be
a
much
better
beer
off
a
fresh
tap

taste
is

from

very
smooth

040807
i
had
one
of
these
the
other
day
i
came
back
for
a
second
today
i
am
not
much
of
a
stout
person
but
i
had
two
that
is
saying
a
lot
for
me
so
i
would
say
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
pours
nearly
black
with
a
thick
medium
tan
head
that
retains
well
sheets
of
lacing
in
the
pint
glass
nose
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
bakers
chocolate
and
espresso
the
palate
is
a
wellbalanced
blend
of
roastedburnt
malt
flavors
a
solid
dry
hop
backbone
has
a
slightly
bitter
flavor
reminiscent
of
a
scorched
malt
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
finished
very
dry
gets
better
as
it
warms
opening
up
the
flavors
a
bit
a
good
example
of
the
dry
stout
style
i
think
d
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
a
satisfying
sipping
beer
although
i
in
general
i
would
limit
myself
to
one
i
might
end
up
in
an
uncontrolled
pucker
nice
caramel
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
on
top
of
a
coallike
black
brew
nose
is
a
suble
smokeysweet
mix
nothing
too
special
yet
once
i
started
drinking
this
i
realized
what
a
quality
stout
this
is
creamy
but
not
too
this
this
has
a
nearperfect
mix
of
flavors
for
the
style
smokey
malts
black
coffee
and
dark
caramel
a
little
tinge
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
and
a
slight
carbonation
just
add
to
the
enjoyment
not
terribly
heavy
for
a
stout
and
much
easier
to
drink
than
most
stouts
as
stouts
go
this
one
is
a
real
winner
incredibly
rich
almost
black
in
the
glass
with
a
small
head
this
is
no
guinness
in
the
foam
department
all
smoky
malt
in
the
nose
decent
mouthfeel
and
very
freshtasting
for
a
stout
a
touch
sweet
on
the
tongue
then
the
smoky
malts
kick
in
almost
a
porterrich
taste
but
the
overall
flavor
is
balanced
with
a
bit
tiny
bit
of
fruity
hops
that
kicks
in
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
end
and
makes
the
beer
overall
extremely
drinkable
excellent
the
taste
is
similar
with
notes
of
coffee
dark
chocolates
and
dark
fruits
coming
through
all
in
all
this
is
quite
a
tasty
stout
although
it
seems
more
american
than
irish
a
minor
sore
spot
i
have
with
this
brew
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
on
the
thin
side
and
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
still
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
a
nice
beer
for
a
cold
day
solid
such
a
hefty
sour
zap
sets
this
stout
apart
interesting
and
boy
does
it
smell
good
when
i
was
in
third
grade
ms
weinberg
used
to
put
a
bear
on
her
desk
on
the
certain
days
that
she
was
grouchy
and
would
warn
us
dont
cross
me
when
the
bear
is
out
these
were
days
when
she
would
deliver
fatal
blows
to
students
this
is
the
worst
handwriting
ive
ever
seen
go
home
tonight
and
practice
until
you
can
write
in
perfect
cursive
i
wish
lakefront
brewery
had
a
bear
to
put
out
on
their
bottles
to
indicate
when
a
brew
is
a
dirty
little
imitator
they
are
so
hit
and
miss
for
a
microbrew
that
it
is
almost
confounding
how
decent
one
beer
tastes
as
compared
to
anothers
blandness
luckily
this
one
isnt
one
of
the
bad
ones
it
delivers
a
reasonable
dark
stout
flavor
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
no
kissing
the
urine
soaked
blarney
stone
here
the
bloodhound
factor
peaches
seemed
interested
in
the
tartness
but
ultimately
found
it
unappealing
benjie
didnt
find
it
at
all
overall
impression
not
a
bad
irish
stout
nice
to
see
american
brewers
making
this
highly
drinkable
style
this
brew
pours
a
solid
black
color
the
head
is
onefinger
in
height
tan
and
had
an
offwhite
ring
around
the
top
along
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
with
a
hint
of
graham
cracker
in
the
background
it
is
quite
aromatic
for
an
irish
style
stout
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
either
it
is
nothing
overpowering
or
big
but
it
is
a
bit
more
than
is
expected
from
a
small
stout
lots
of
roasted
malt
shows
though
up
front
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
the
back
ground
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
it
could
be
a
little
smoother
though
but
it
isnt
bad
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
irish
stouts
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
i
would
certainly
choose
this
over
guinness
anyday
overall
not
bad
a
bit
light
for
my
tastes
and
a
bit
too
bitter
on
the
finish
and
aftertaste
worth
a
try
at
least
i
can
drink
it
down
just
fine
but
will
not
return
to
it
after
this
6
pack
is
over
and
done
pours
with
an
incredibly
black
body
not
a
hint
of
light
gets
through
head
is
also
very
dark
tan
foam
smell
has
good
coffee
tones
to
it
but
also
slightly
musty
like
wet
dog
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
good
coffee
flavors
ending
in
a
nice
hop
finish
the
off
scent
doesnt
translate
into
the
beer
at
all
a
decent
stout
if
not
underwhelming
a
decent
enough
beer
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
retry
in
2005
has
me
thinking
more
positive
things
about
this
beer
especially
the
tangy
smoke
qualities
and
body
being
much
richer
and
sweeter
than
i
experienced
before
almost
black
not
quite
nice
looking
thin
creamy
brown
head
lacing
comes
in
nice
big
sheets
nice
aroma
of
blackened
malts
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
little
smoke
the
body
of
this
beer
is
medium
at
best
a
little
light
carbonation
is
just
a
little
too
prickly
taste
is
decent
but
reserved
nuttiness
and
roasted
malt
characteristics
are
too
subtle
this
one
is
not
bad
just
not
much
better
than
average
what
is
going
on
lakefront
cocoa
coffee
malt
first
sniff
nice
dark
chocolate
coffee
taste
a
little
sweeter
than
most
irish
stouts
feels
very
thin
on
the
palate
chocolate
taste
lingers
on
but
weakens
as
you
go
along
if
its
your
first
stout
of
the
day
its
a
great
beer
itll
come
down
a
couple
notches
if
its
your
second
or
third
because
of
its
thinness
the
drinkability
factor
is
high
here
particularly
for
those
who
like
their
stouts
roasted
and
dry
as
a
bone
any
fan
of
guinness
will
be
a
fan
of
snake
chaser
slainte
i
enjoyed
lakefronts
newest
beer
and
am
glad
they
continue
to
experiment
with
new
styles
the
beer
poured
a
slick
50
black
liquid
that
gave
rise
to
smoth
creamy
top
i
can
smell
the
burnt
grainsmalt
along
with
hints
of
coffechocolate
the
brew
seems
to
have
a
little
more
carbination
that
your
typical
stout
and
perhaps
this
is
why
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
the
average
stout
unlike
other
stouts
i
think
i
could
have
this
with
dinner
and
be
able
to
drink
this
bottle
and
few
more
without
feeling
bloated
i
wonder
how
this
brew
would
taste
through
a
nitrotap
snake
chaser
pours
black
in
color
with
some
dark
mahogany
highlights
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
finger
thick
creamy
tan
head
reduces
to
a
surface
covering
that
lingers
throughout
most
of
consumption
aroma
consists
of
roasted
malt
roasted
coffee
with
hints
of
sweet
cocoa
as
the
beer
warms
and
just
a
touch
of
caramel
very
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
to
mediumbodied
with
some
coarse
carbonation
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
bittersweet
chocolate
upfront
dryness
starts
in
the
middle
smooth
burnt
malt
and
roasted
coffee
flavors
round
out
the
dry
lingering
finish
flavor
is
very
full
and
satisfying
the
dryness
is
classic
for
an
irish
stout
very
well
done
a
musthave
for
st
patricks
day
worth
a
try
from
the
singles
cooler
at
least
i
know
some
people
like
this
kind
of
taste
very
bitter
dry
chocolate
coffee
and
licorice
were
all
around
the
flavor
profile
my
only
problem
was
that
the
minimal
hop
presense
was
barely
enough
to
balance
the
finish
let
alone
the
entire
beer
way
too
light
super
watery
seemed
to
be
missing
something
probably
underrated
here
this
was
the
only
beer
i
had
at
russian
river
that
was
neither
hoppy
or
sour
that
really
impressed
me
its
a
big
chalky
textured
stout
thats
as
dry
as
they
come
but
loaded
with
deep
earthy
roast
that
never
turns
acrid
or
bitter
its
drinkable
too
at
a
real
low
abv
and
a
mouthfeel
that
almost
leaves
me
thirsty
there
are
coffee
notes
in
here
too
rich
and
creamy
in
that
way
but
a
dark
chocolate
complexion
arises
before
the
finish
i
get
the
grain
before
the
flavors
it
produces
which
is
how
i
like
it
yeast
has
done
a
complete
job
here
residual
sugar
is
nil
its
really
easy
to
put
this
one
back
although
maybe
it
does
lack
a
finish
just
a
bit
i
had
no
idea
russian
river
made
beers
that
werent
the
hop
bombs
or
the
sours
and
while
most
of
the
ones
i
tried
were
pretty
pedestrian
this
stout
really
stood
out
as
a
top
quality
beer
guinness
with
deeper
flavor
better
body
and
color
i
had
this
on
nitrotap
and
the
mouthfeel
was
heavenly
rich
and
silkysmooth
i
got
some
burnt
malt
but
not
overpowering
as
in
some
other
stouts
i
tasted
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
with
no
offputting
sourness
ive
experienced
in
some
stouts
very
crisp
and
refreshing
finish
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
if
youre
near
the
brewery
its
a
taponly
deal
o
ok
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
santa
rosa
ill
start
off
by
saying
this
was
the
best
dry
irish
stout
i
have
ever
tasted
dark
black
color
good
tan
head
aroma
was
chocolate
coffee
dark
malts
great
flavor
was
exactly
the
same
and
so
robust
this
was
delicious
and
id
order
pints
regularly
if
i
ever
saw
it
on
tap
tried
as
part
of
a
sampler
at
the
brewery
this
was
a
black
pour
with
super
creamy
light
brown
khaki
head
chocolate
and
espresso
on
the
aroma
plenty
of
roast
to
go
along
surprised
at
the
big
aroma
for
such
a
light
stout
big
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
flavor
finishes
with
lingering
charred
roast
this
has
more
flavor
than
i
have
had
in
any
dry
stout
nicely
done
very
thin
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
very
easy
with
velvety
carb
not
bad
at
all
and
i
would
have
this
again
despite
this
being
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
m
its
medium
body
this
pours
a
dark
coffee
color
with
cocoacolored
foam
theres
a
delicious
roasty
aroma
thats
followed
by
a
sweet
roast
on
the
palate
with
hints
of
french
roast
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
notes
finishes
sweet
i
like
to
call
it
dessert
in
a
glass
perfect
capstone
to
a
day
of
ipas
and
belgian
sours
o
not
impressed
would
not
have
again
or
recommend
to
anyone
other
than
people
who
like
guinness
drinkable
enough
at
the
start
but
with
the
build
up
of
ashiness
on
the
back
harms
it
im
surprised
to
say
i
didnt
find
this
as
good
as
id
hoped
but
then
maybe
i
just
have
unreasonable
expectations
overall
a
nice
stout
rich
good
flavor
but
nothing
overly
special
still
i
will
not
turn
this
one
down
o
pretty
good
stout
really
liked
the
earthy
flavor
a
mild
smooth
light
cocao
experience
medium
body
and
creamy
from
the
nitro
a
forgettable
beer
from
rr
dark
black
with
a
solid
finger
of
tan
head
mild
bitter
coffee
and
roast
malt
flavor
is
mostly
bitter
malt
and
black
coffee
thin
with
mild
carbonation
nothing
really
stands
out
just
another
irish
stout
then
again
i
didnt
come
here
for
a
stout
pours
a
rich
dark
chocolate
with
a
dense
creamy
off
white
head
long
lasting
retention
and
thick
sheets
of
lacing
weak
aroma
of
mild
roast
malt
and
coffee
with
light
hops
in
the
finish
dry
creamy
body
with
roast
malt
and
mild
coffee
not
bad
but
a
little
boring
and
one
dimensional
dr
very
drinkable
and
affordable
id
have
it
again
strange
for
a
stout
all
things
considered
it
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
however
o
the
flavors
were
ok
but
he
body
was
not
up
to
rr
standards
this
is
one
of
the
many
beers
that
i
wonder
what
it
would
taste
like
out
of
a
normal
co2
tap
or
even
better
out
of
a
cask
im
just
not
the
biggest
fan
of
nitro
setups
with
that
said
this
is
still
a
nice
dry
stout
cheers
cheers
you
may
think
hops
when
you
think
russian
river
but
thats
not
the
case
here
this
is
a
pretty
traditional
irish
stout
led
by
roasted
barley
and
malt
subtleties
and
its
really
creamy
with
the
nitro
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
had
great
depth
and
richness
and
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
the
addition
of
the
hop
flavor
really
worked
well
here
o
a
great
tasting
and
highly
drinkable
stout
the
low
alcohol
makes
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
again
and
again
the
aroma
was
loaded
with
roasted
malts
though
not
as
heavy
as
one
would
expect
given
the
big
look
of
it
light
hope
notes
were
also
noticed
in
here
with
a
small
plum
or
raisin
like
note
almost
like
some
dark
belgian
yeast
was
used
as
it
warmed
some
light
cocoa
started
to
show
as
well
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
started
out
with
a
nice
bit
of
roasted
malts
which
then
careened
off
into
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
lots
of
cocoa
and
light
licorice
hints
swirling
around
in
the
background
giving
it
some
nice
depth
very
nice
feel
rich
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
that
led
to
never
a
dull
moment
and
something
that
would
be
best
categorized
as
not
very
dry
at
all
a
solid
if
unexceptional
stout
theres
good
flavour
here
but
there
are
certainly
better
beers
on
the
menu
good
not
a
must
have
overy
easy
drinking
its
definitely
better
than
an
average
dry
stout
but
i
think
it
lacks
some
serious
or
unique
flavor
to
me
this
is
good
but
it
has
a
long
way
to
go
before
it
makes
a
lasting
impression
like
other
craft
dry
stouts
have
done
beer
is
super
smooth
and
medium
in
body
there
is
a
little
sweetness
up
front
and
some
midpalate
hoppiness
to
it
that
is
followed
up
by
some
really
nice
bitterness
from
the
roast
with
a
moderately
dry
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
a
nitro
a
cask
version
would
also
be
quite
good
so
silky
smooth
rr
should
triple
the
alcohol
and
stick
this
in
a
bourbon
barrel
for
6
months
kidding
its
fine
the
way
it
is
had
on
nitro
tap
at
russian
river
brewing
nice
compact
2
fingers
of
head
very
blackdark
brown
reminiscent
of
what
guinness
looks
like
on
tap
smells
very
toasty
chocolatey
does
not
have
that
sour
watery
smell
that
youd
get
out
a
guinness
very
toasty
coffee
and
chocolatey
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
light
everything
an
irish
stout
should
be
fin
amazing
goes
down
like
an
iced
coffee
can
it
please
overall
a
tasty
stout
drinkability
meh
i
didnt
finish
it
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
nitro
making
for
a
creamy
head
on
black
coffee
roast
aroma
flavour
chocolate
a
little
watery
and
can
only
drink
so
much
of
it
sessionable
stout
a
guiness
sub
but
even
a
guiness
fan
did
not
like
it
good
for
a
change
of
pace
but
not
the
specialty
of
the
house
i
only
realized
this
was
on
nitro
as
they
brought
it
out
to
me
at
first
i
was
bummed
because
the
only
nitro
beer
ive
enjoyed
is
murphys
and
ive
tried
a
few
theres
over
a
finger
of
solid
tan
head
thats
clearly
not
going
anywhere
the
beer
is
black
opaque
with
nothing
pulling
through
in
terms
of
light
aromas
are
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
are
similar
with
an
emphasis
on
the
espresso
great
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
melding
together
mouthfeel
is
light
with
low
carb
which
is
nitros
biggest
downfall
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
delicious
beer
with
the
only
bummer
being
the
lighter
undercarbonated
body
drinkability
it
was
really
good
usually
everything
they
have
is
awesome
i
order
this
a
few
times
a
year
it
is
a
good
version
of
the
style
that
is
usually
overlooked
with
so
many
other
offerings
worth
a
try
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
from
rr
d
4
8
are
you
kidding
me
this
is
a
freaking
fantastic
beer
to
sit
with
all
damn
day
long
nicely
blended
not
very
filling
and
goes
down
way
smooth
d
this
is
a
great
sessioneasy
drinking
stout
the
flavors
are
nice
and
the
alcohol
is
low
providing
a
beer
that
you
can
easily
have
several
of
throughout
the
night
draught
at
the
brewpub
deep
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
light
creamy
cocoa
aroma
the
flavor
is
dry
and
roasty
with
some
acidic
dark
malt
and
a
bitter
dry
and
lightly
acidic
finish
light
and
flat
mouthfeel
on
the
bitteracidic
side
of
the
style
which
makes
it
interesting
but
also
still
not
that
great
d
the
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
but
there
was
really
nothing
special
about
the
taste
of
this
one
had
this
on
nitrotap
at
the
russian
river
pub
the
board
says
that
its
currently
at
4
15
poured
black
with
brown
highlights
very
creamy
tan
head
as
should
be
expected
from
a
nitro
pour
the
head
sticks
around
quite
well
and
leaves
some
fine
lacing
smells
quite
roasty
with
some
light
earthy
hops
tastes
a
little
on
the
thinner
side
with
some
sour
graininess
some
medium
roastiness
and
a
fairly
bitter
earthy
finish
smooth
and
roasty
in
the
mouth
could
be
a
tad
creamier
enjoyable
for
bing
so
low
abv
d
one
of
the
finest
nitro
pours
ive
ever
been
served
very
good
dry
irish
stout
with
an
emphasis
on
the
roast
yet
it
also
packs
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
the
nutty
character
also
adds
more
depth
making
for
a
tasty
brew
if
i
hadnt
already
sampled
all
the
sours
here
i
probably
would
have
ordered
several
more
of
these
especially
for
dessert
taste
mouthfeel
roasty
and
dry
chocolate
and
coffee
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
but
very
creamy
on
the
tongue
dry
and
bitter
in
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
this
is
surely
a
step
up
from
most
irish
dry
stouts
more
aromatic
more
flavorful
but
still
light
in
body
and
alcohol
a
great
alternative
to
guinness
d
isnt
masking
a
particularly
high
abv
but
is
drinkable
for
a
stout
the
beer
looks
great
its
a
very
dark
brown
or
black
with
a
head
that
just
refuses
to
dissipate
the
nose
was
mostly
malt
but
a
bit
weak
there
were
some
lurking
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
in
the
aroma
the
beer
delivered
more
taste
than
the
smell
indicated
it
has
a
light
roasted
malt
flavor
than
is
better
balanced
and
more
interesting
than
most
beers
of
this
style
the
beer
was
still
somewhat
lightbodied
for
me
i
probably
would
have
loved
this
beer
back
when
i
was
primarily
drinking
guinness
but
ba
has
happily
ruined
those
days
for
me
its
a
drinkable
stout
with
a
great
flavor
and
a
light
body
on
tap
at
the
rr
brewpub
pours
pitch
black
with
a
dark
beige
head
nose
dark
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
very
dry
and
roasty
with
wood
and
smoky
undertones
the
nitro
is
not
overbearing
in
adding
creaminess
this
dry
stout
is
true
to
its
name
and
is
thinner
in
body
than
expected
a
real
brewing
feat
low
in
carbonation

slides

and

however
the
flavour
then
thins
rapidly
becoming
a

weak
and
watery
before
picking
up
a
little
for
the
finish
which
unfortunately
is
marred
by
the
light
burntmoldyskunky
quality
i
noticed
in
the
aroma
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
flavorful
stout
that
checks
in
at
only
4

abv
i
could
see
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
seating
on
nitro
tap
at
the
russian
river
pub
poured
um
black
with
a
nice
creamy
light
tan
head
the
beer
was
creamy
and
contained
a
lot
of
sweetness
the
roastiness
was
still
there
but
not
in
huge
amounts
and
a
lot
of
chocolate
came
through
the
mouthfeel
was
very
slick
but
airy
i
really
liked
this
stout
sometimes
the
roastiness
is
too
much
for
me
but
that
was
not
the
case
here
drinkability
i
guess
this
could
be
sessionable
not
a
bunch
of
flavor
that
jumps
out
at
you
though
the
flavors
are
smoke
and
roasted
malts
not
my
favorites
also
it
was
kind
of
watery
another
attribute
i
dont
like
this
was
definitely
my
least
favorite
beer
from
russian
river
wow
i
was
so
unimpressed
by
this
beer
i
love
russian
river
beers
perhaps
because
it
was
on
cask
at
the
san
diego
real
ale
fest
it
may
have
tasted
different
than
what
it
was
meant
to
on
draft
or
in
a
bottle
beer
was
dark
no
head
could
be
because
of
cask
mouthfeel
was
light
for
a
stout
taste
was
rather
boring
also
nothing
spectacular
i
will
review
it
again
when
i
have
a
chance
to
try
a
different
version
overall
this
was
the
first
beer
that
i
ever
had
at
russian
river
brewing
company
and
i
swear
i
can
recollect
every
single
aspect
of
it
it
is
too
easy
to
pass
this
one
over
in
the
wake
of
all
of
the
other
great
brews
but
this
too
is
a
very
charismatic
stout
one
of
the
regular
beers
that
comes
out
of
rrbc
and
rarely
seen
out
of
the
brewery
tap
dont
make
the
mistake
of
overlooking
and
missing
this
one
sláinte
on
tap
at
rr
brewpub
in
santa
rosa
wonderful
creamy
appearance
dark
roasted
and
smooth
as
hell
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
disappointing
right
away
lacks
the
body
youd
expect
from
a
stout
other
than
that
great
roasted
flavours
chocolate
and
espresso
like
a
delicious
iced
coffee
easy
to
drink
a
great
session
stout
solid
brown
nitro
top
adds
a
dark
solid
color
contrast
between
the
black
body
and
brown
top
aromas
of
mild
vanilla
and
cappucino
this
beer
mimics
and
perfects
the
fluid
cold
smoothness
that
guinness
also
does
well
seemed
to
be


you
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
and
not
get
drunk
it

that
begs
to
be

taprussian
river

this
is
a
good
guinness
clone
only
this
is
much
much
better
soft
and
dry
coffeed
texture
lightly
roasted
decently
long
finish
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
pretty
much
the
perfect
session
stout
good
robust
flavour
but
not
too
heavy
flavor
is
initially
coffe
with
corny
notes
and
a
strong
roast
that
dries
out
the
niddle
malt
as
a
large
hop
bitterness
finally
throws
through
to
a
good
dry
finish
being
nitrogenated
this
is
one
smooth
stout
and
very
easy
on
the
palate
the
light
carbonation
is
just
enough
to
make
it
dance
on
the
tongue
without
being
anywhere
near
fizzy
all
in
all
a
well
crafted
brew
and
something
im
sure
ill
be
coming
back
for
again
and
again
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
simple
a
medium
body
that
holds
its
own
no
watery
finish
this
stout
goes
down
easy
carbonation
is
mild
and
one
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
off
of
the
cask
this
stout
poured
an
opaque
black
color
with
light
brown
foam
that
clinged
and
coated
the
glass
a
bit
impressive
for
a
beer
on
cask
the
smell
was
slightly
sweet
and
malty
very
roasted
with
notes
of
cocoa
the
taste
was
roasted
malt
with
elements
of
cocoa
and
oats
very
delicious
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
mediumfull
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
it
was
dry
with
only
hints
of
light
sweetness
it
was
relatively
clean
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
and
was
one
of
the
best
beers
offered
at
the
real
ale
fest
the
beer
pulls
from
the
cask
an
onyx
color
the
head
thick
and
tall
the
color
chocolate
brown
the
texture
creamy
with
the
lace
a
glutinous
sheet
to
cling
mightily
to
the
glass
nose
was
sweet
chocolate
coffee
with
a
rich
toasted
grain
aroma
to
end
it
all
start
was
ambrosia
rich
in
malt
and
the
top
full
and
creamy
finish
was
gentle
in
it
acidity
the
hops
perfection
somewhat
bittersweet
and
dry
aftertaste
i
voted
this
the
hit
of
the
fest
at
least
for
me
and
just
missed
by
a
frog
hair
of
getting
some
at
obriens
damn
well
better
luck
next
time
this
light
colored
stout
it
leans
more
towards
brown
than
black
left
some
of
the
best
lacing
i
have
encountered
a
solid
coating
really
added
to
the
ambience
this
beer
had
a
strong
roasty
aroma
taste
profile
seemed
to
have
some
strong
licorice
notes
to
it
almost
imparted
a
medicinal
taste
a
well
made
stout
that
just
didnt
quite
make
it
with
me
taste
wise
could
grow
on
you
though
ful
bodied
and
enjoyable
if
you
can
adapt
to
the
different
taste
o
my
first
moylans
beer
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
for
the
style
this
is
good
easy
to
drink
and
has
real
nice
roasted
qualities
worth
trying
just
dont
pay
too
much
for
it
mmmm
overall
quite
a
decent
dry
stout
plenty
of
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
at
around
au12
a
bottle
an
equivalent
case
of
24
x
330ml
being
around
130
this
is
cheaper
than
other
topend
brews
from
moylans
heretic
etc
but
it
is
also
not
the
best
topend
beer
i
have
ever
had
overall
a
decent
dry
stout
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
average
at
best
rjt
a
bit
too
onedimensional
and
not
really
all
that
irish
dry
stout
seeming
the
variable
milkiness
again
is
illapplied
that
aside
this
is
drinkable
as
an

overall
a

smooth
drinkable
dry

overall
with
a

thicker
and
creamier

this
would
be
slightly
above
average
as
it
is
however
it
is
not
worth
a
second
look
black
color
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
foamy
tan
head
that
is
stable
for
a
few
minutes
with
medium
amounts
of
lacing
smells
and
tastes
of
lightly
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
all
the
usual
suspects
but
doesnt
really
promote
any
of
them
as
aggressively
as
it
could
to
make
it
more
memorable
amongst
other
irish
dry
stouts
although
the
body
is
light
crisp
and
clean
in
execution
it
also
seems
at
time
to
be
as
thin
as
the
flavor
within
id
call
it
a
good
beginners
introduction
to
their
first
dry
stouts
its
just
not
quite
as
complex
as
others
but
that
makes
it
accessible
pours
a
black
body
with
thick
tan
head
smell
is
pronounced
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
something
sugary
there
is
definitely
something
sweet
and
fruity
in
there
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
otherwise
its
very
dry
indeed
kind
of
thin
despite
the
creamy
head
i
guess
thats
how
the
style
goes
i
liked
it
but
probably
wouldnt
reach
for
it
again
overall
not
bad
flavor
but
too
thin
for
a
stout
if
this
was
a
little
thicker
and
creamier
this
would
be
great
id
get
it
again
a
little
roast
barley
with
a
dishwater
aftertaste
no
detectable
smell
some
black
malt
but
mostly
a
lager
sort
of
flavor
maybe
its
tired
from
the
st
patricks
weekend
could
only
be
better
in
the
bottle
b
o
an
ok
example
of
the
style
with
some
excellent
aromas
unfortunately
the
main
body
of
the
drink
was
a
little
too
thin
which
let
it
down
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
tasting
stout
it
just
isnt
a
special
one
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
more
robust
fullbodied
and
complex
just
average
i
have
to
remind
myself
after
so
much
brewed
in
american
fashion
which
is
a
good
thing
that
while
this
is
a
stout
its
not
a
mindblowingly
massive
ris
its
got
a
fullish
body
but
teeters
on
the
edge
of
it
and
is
smooth
but
not
especially
robust
without
lacking
richness
the
feel
is
dry
stopping
just
short
of
chalky
its
on
par
for
an
irish
dry
not
sn
american
or
bigger
poured
an
excellent
black
with
some
very
nice
head
and
good
lacing
throughout
deep
and
dark
malty
scent
with
good
roasted
grain
aromas
quite
a
bit
of
coffee
maybe
too
much
and
a
nice
earthy
grounding
good
flavors
as
well
with
a
huge
coffee
flavor
nice
roastiness
and
a
nice
earthyneutral
hop
finish
goes
down
extremely
well
very
dry
and
slightly
bitter
nice
and
creamy
a
very
excellent
dry
irish
stout
with
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
much
coffee
o
ok
for
the
style
not
my
cupobeer
though
the
beer
pours
fairly
handsome
a
very
dark
color
with
a
hefty
cap
of
creamy
tan
foam
above
it
the
aroma
is
light
chocolate
the
beer
slinks
across
the
palate
with
a
creamy
texture
the
flavor
is
mainly
a
sprinkling
of
cocoa
powder
the
creamy
texture
along
with
the
cocoa
conjures
of
thoughts
of
milk
chocolaty
drinks
the
palate
is
left
a
bit
dry
as
it
should
be
not
a
bad
beer
overall
well
done
irish
dry
this
is
a
style
that
often
falls
off
into
boring
and
onenote
brews
but
a
well
made
one
is
a
thing
of
beauty
rich
and
full
but
still
true
to
style
my
only
gripe
is
that
this
is
only
sold
in
bombers
sixers
of
this
would
make
this
a
regular
purchase
overall
im
letdown
by
this
ale
not
dark
roast
malted
enough
for
my
taste
more
like
a
porter
ive
had
more
flavorful
dry
stouts
o
an
easy
drinking
crisp
stout
the
bomber
was
an
easy
finish
for
me
solo
i
wont
be
buying
this
again

nothing

i
really
enjoyed

for

just
about

b
i
like
the

it
looks
divine

wise
i
have
other

in

that
said
i
would
have
no

downing
a

of
these
overall
a
onedimensional
irish
dry
stout
that
delivers
pretty
well
on

no
surprises
with
this
one
decent
goto
beer
for

dont
go
into

nothing
to

in

liking
the

in

flavors
are

with

have

which
eventually
totally
dissipated
color
is
clear
dark
burnt
umber
brown
smell
is
coffee
and
dark
roasted
malts
taste
is
more
of
the
same
and
also
has
a
slight
hint
of
cocoa
if
i
were
using
guinness
as
a
benchmark
for
stouts
and
compared
the
two
id
say
guinness
has
the
better
body
and
mouthfeel
but
moylans
has
more
flavor
so
all
in
all
a
quality
stout
which
holds
its
own
overall
good
stout
not
as
dry
as
i
was
expecting
but
tasted
good
o
overall
i
would
rank
this
beer
above
average
it
fits
the
style
well
it
is
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
would
like
and
i
wish
it
was
less
carbonated
the
drinkability
suffers
a
little
because
of
this
after
all
thats
what
a
dry
stout
is
for
the
pour
was
nice
enough
very
dark
brown
basically
black
with
no
light
shining
through
on
this
one
at
all
rich
looking
head
of
tan
on
the
top
hung
around
for
most
of
the
session
the
aroma
was
a
bit
light
lots
of
roasted
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
cocoa
underneath
it
really
dry
taste
but
a
little
bland
for
me
light
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
but
it
lacked
alot
of
depth
to
put
it
over
the
top
into
another
cateogory
still
though
it
was
a
decent
little
stout
with
a
nice
feel
and
a
3
5
percent
very
drinkable
not
sure
i
would
go
here
again
though
i
actually
had
it
with
a
baked
potato
which
brought
out
the
bacon
flavor
from
the
bits
that
i
topped
the
spud
with
quality
beer
for
an
inexpensive
bottle
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
examples
of
the
style
o
not
bad
i
would
try
again

are
better

out
there
tho

be

or
yon
appears
trim
and
clean

and
wiry

hits
you
with

it
is
indeed
a
punch

with
it

lots
of
elements
not
so
much
harmony
as
a
result
does
not
deliver
high
scores
on
general
drinkability
from
the
aroma
i
thought
this
would
be
a
winner
but
with
the
watery
taste
it
is
only
average
d
great
beer
doesnt
any
better
i
love
stouts
and
ive
had
some
good
stuff
from
moylans
but
this
one
was
disappointing
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
very
thick
creamy
head
pretty
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
looks
like
a
stout
and
looks
good
smell
is
somewhat
subtle
but
has
a
very
malty
sweet
character
vanilla
and
chocolate
are
pretty
obvious
but
i
cant
pick
out
the
rest
taste
is
kind
of
subdued
very
creamy
and
definitely
vanilla
is
the
main
taste
not
much
bitter
flavor
or
hops
though
pretty
low
for
a
stout
it
was
somewhat
medium
to
light
bodied
and
not
very
carbonated
its
alright
but
there
are
much
better
stouts
out
there
im
disappointingly
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
given
that
moylans
is
one
of
my
favourite
breweries
and
irish
dry
stout
is
one
of
my
favourite
beer
styles
needs
a
little
work
this
one
brendan
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
an
overall
dry
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
great
low
abv
great
tasting
very
aromatic
drinkability
doesnt
get
any
better
if
only
hopsickle
were
this
good
pours
a
dark
black
brew
with
a
foamy
lingering
beige
head
that
stays
around
roasted
goodness
in
the
aroma
with
a
big
chocolatecocoa
presence
in
the
background
the
taste
is
roasty
with
some
smoke
in
the
mix
a
little
hoppy
on
the
swallow
with
minimal
carbonation
some
coffee
characteristics
linger
in
the
aftertase
and
leaves
the
mouth
salivating
at
only
5
this
was
a
nice
sipping
beer
to
fully
enjoy
the
bomber
an
excellent
take
on
the
irish
dry
stout
and
the
label
states
it
was
brewed
in
the
irish
tradition
i
feel
the
irish
would
be
proud
despite
the
carbonation
its
very
drinkable
a
great
beer
and
a
pretty
darn
good
representation
of
the
style
i
wondered
how
this
usually
hopheavy
brewery
was
going
to
handle
a
beer
like
this
and
it
is
certainly
less
west
coast
than
all
the
other
beers
ive
had
by
them
its
not
my
favorite
style
and
not
my
favorite
moylans
beer
but
im
glad
for
the
experience
all
the
same
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
lacked
originality
probably
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
of
irish
dry
stouts
a
simple
roasted
character
is
dominate
which
is
very
enjoyable
not
overly
astringent
or
oxidized
like
i
have
found
with
many
moylans
stouts
just
enjoyable
something
i
would
recommend
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
stout
i
could
drink
regularly
and
not
tire
of
because
of
its
balanced
flavor
its
one
drawback
is
its
faint
smell
i
want
a
little
more
on
the
nose
pours
a
pitch
black
colour
with
thin
head
and
minimal
lacing
smells
of
coffee
mild
chocolate
with
some
mild
fruit
and
roasted
malt
i
notice
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
flavour
with
the
sweet
malt
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
but
nice
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
stout
drinks
easy
a
serviceable
enough
dry
stout
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
m
thinner
than
expected
dvery
drinkable
irish
dry
stout
which
for
the
record
is
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
drinkability
is
quite
nice
as
well
flavorful
without
ever
wearing
on
the
palate
had
this
one
been
packed
into
a
beer
with
a
slightly
lower
abv
say
4
it
would
have
been
a
perfect
5
very
nice
beer
from
moylans
very
impressive
this
is
a
promising
interpretation
of
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
styles
a
deep
ebony
with
hues
consistent
with
creme
brulee
in
the
head
and
lacing
s
just
as
it
should
be
cocoa
carob
a
hint
of
licorice
earthy
blackened
maltiness
t
strong
character
of
smoky
peat
and
slightly
acrid
grains
and
a
medicinal
composition
up
front
with
an
incredibly
dry
clean
disappearing
finish
mf
excellent
coats
the
palate
without
being
overpowering
allows
for
lingering
transition
between
the
assertive
first
punch
and
the
phantom
finish
d
very
high
for
a
dry
stout
more
complexity
that
many
dry
irish
stouts
without
affecting
the
drinkability
each
sip
begs
to
be
followed
by
another
as
the
evaporative
character
leaves
the
drinker
wanting
yet
another
imbibition
very
good
stuff
i
would
love
to
sample
this
on
draft
or
dare
i
say
it
on
cask
not
nearly
as
sessionable
as
a
guinness
murphys
or
beamish
nor
should
it
be
solid
as
the
military
unit
whose
name
it
bears
d
comparing
beers
is
a
necessary
evil
when
reviewing
so
i
have
to
contrast
the
sharpness
of
dragoons
with
the
rich
creaminess
of
murphys
though
the
former
is
certainly
drinkable
id
rather
session
with
the
latter
and
while
were
on
the
topic
of
comparing
beers
one
sniff
of
a
ukborn
and
bred
dry
irish
stout
transports
me
right
to
london
dragoons
gets
me
on
the
plane
serves
me
a
beer
from
the
beverage
cart
and
then
drops
me
off
back
in
my
living
room
poured

with
a

poor

spotty

smelled
of

toffee

caramel
same
in
the
taste
nicely
blended
with
a
semisweet
finish
on
the
thin
side
with
little
carbonation
a
little
too
sweet
of
a
finish
for
an
irish
stout
for
me
but
still
a
drinkable
beer
this
beer
isnt
overly
flavorful
but
its
got
enough
to
keep
ones
attention
it
succeeds
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
due
to
the
abv
and
low
viscosity
nice
beer
to
try
and
again
a

another

example
of
a
classic
style
from
the

braintrust
overall
impression
while
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
ubiquitous
nitro
irish
stouts
this
could
use
a
little
cleaning
up
quite
enjoyable
as
is
though
overall
not
as
big
subtle
smooth
or
rich
as
guinness
extra
stout
which
not
even
being
brewed
in
ireland
anymore
isnt
a
good
indication
of
this
beers
quality
not
a
bad
beer
in
any
way
but
not
nearly
close
enough
to
the
leaders
of
this
style
to
be
worth
spending
much
time
or
money
on
a
pretty
underwhelming
beer
wow
taste
is
nearly
a
milk
stout
and
less
a
irishstyle
stout
pretty
sweet
and
malty
all
the
way
through
lots
of
dark
malty
flavours
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
deep
down
and
indeed
a
bit
of
milkiness
like
mackesons
not
as
assertive
in
the
sugar
department
as
mackeson
but
it
does
taste
similar
mouthfeel
has
a
great
weight
to
it

only

i
was
unsure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
it
certainly
did
not
fail
to
please
even
though
this
did
not
drink
like
the
style
in
which
it
is
supposed
to
be
irish
dry
its
still
a
very
well
crafted
stout
good
job
moylans
while
this
isnt
terribly
complex
it
is
tasty
and
very
drinkable
if
it
didnt
flatten
out
so
much
as
it
warmed
it
would
rate
a
lot
higher
d
a
nice
pint
on
st
patricks
day
one
of
the
best
irish
dry
stouts
out
there
and
its
made
in
ca
mouthfeel
has
a
slick
creamy
texture
guinness
is
the
standard
for
a
dry
irish
stout
this
version
has
more
body
and
flavor
than
guinness
solid
stout
and
enjoyable
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
i
was
pretty
disappointed
this
bottle
could
be
old
or
the
flavors
could
be
off

more

the

came
out
more
as

a

just
some
to
round
out
the

pretty

decent

recommended
pours
a
nearly
opaque
blackbrown
with
a
nice
finger
of
khaki
head
that
unfortunately
dies
away
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
primarily
coffee
with
a
dash
of
cream
and
some
plums
and
figs
squatting
in
there
as
well
the
taste
generally
follows
with
those
coffee
nots
dominating
and
the
dark
fruits
pushed
all
the
way
back
to
the
finish
and
there
joined
by
some
red
berries
as
well
the
heavily
medium
body
leaves
a
baseline
chalkiness
behind
and
the
carbonation
feels
overly
upratcheted
forcing
down
the
drinkability
from
what
wouldcould
have
been
decently
tall
heights
dvery
easy
drinking
and
a
nice
taste
the
huge
butterscotch
nose
actually
threw
me
off
at
first
the
roasted
and
coffee
malts
really
came
through
in
the
taste
though
with
a
nice
balancing
of
big
roasted
malts
and
a
little
hop
backbone
poured
a
thickish
black
with
minor
tan
head
that
died
quickly
a
great

covers

of
sweetness
such
as
vanilla
caramel
molasses
syrup
dark
chocolate
hints
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
mediumbodied
and
smooth
this
is
a
simple
beer
with
chocolate
sweetness
even
stickiness
mixing
with
some
roasted
malt
for
a
sweet
beer
more
than
chocolate
to
note
that
finishes
a
tad
dry
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
for
with
enjoyability
open
a
bottle
and
just
down
this
bc
it
is
real
goo
aroma
is
smoky
with
a
firm
overtone
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
a
roast
coffee
undertone
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
sable
that
is
just
a
shade
above
black
and
has
a
thick
finebubbled
fairly
persistent
buff
head
flavor
is
smoky
and
fairly
chocolaty
not
sweet
and
just
a
teeny
bit
yeasty
texture
is
fairly
smooth
a
bit
chalky
and
fairly
fizzy
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
but
not
disappointing
md
lighter
body
but
high
carbonation
easy
to
down
and
can
i
have
another
please
lightly
carbonated
and
drinkable
enough
not
my
favorite
style
in
the
world
but
this
is
a
worthy
version
d
overall
this
didnt
seem
like
a
balanced
beer
one
flavor
dominated
burnt
on
cask
at
coles
cask
fest
black
with
caesar
with
a
white
bubby
head
stout
aroma
but
above
average
mouthfeel
a
bit
sourness
in
it
drinkable
but
still
not
that
great
a
stout
what
can
i
do
im
not
a
great
fan
of
the
style
and
i
do
not
get
it
on
tap
d
i
think
that
i
can
count
the
number
of
dry
stouts
ive
had
on
1
hand
this
one
is
top
notch
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
definetly
recommend
this
taste
is
also
great
plenty
of
charred
grain
flavors
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
and
more
malted
milk
balls
with
a
very
mild
black
licorice
molasses
flavor
in
the
background
this
is
not
overwhelming
though
no
nagging
off
flavors
no
over
abundance
of
charred
burnt
flavors
this
is
spot
on
for
the
style
i
guess
its
because
ive
had
so
many
terrible
dry
stouts
in
the
past
i
have
been
turned
off
to
the
style
as
a
whole
but
now
the
tables
have
turned
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
in
the
style
that
ive
enjoyed
more
even
though
it
could
be
considered
an
american
stoutdry
irish
stout
hybrid
well
worth

i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
strong
oak
taste
was
a
little
much
for
me
looked
and
smelled
great
however
almost
black
with
a
milkchocolate
head
this
seems
to
be
a
slow
drinker
might
be
good
with
a
cigar
or
cured
meats
and
strong
cheese
also
seems
a
bit
weak
on
the
alcohol
side
unique
stout
and
worth
a
try
all
and
all
a
good
stout
not
as
thick
and
thus
a
bit
easier
to
drink
than
some
others
i

this
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
west

version
of
dry
stout
shakespeare
from
rogue
is
not
a
dry
stout
in
my
book
d
no
feature
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
except
maybe
the
smell
once
warm
but
not
too
warm
cant
dwell
on
that
though
main
takeaway
regardless
whether
you
love
it
its
impossible
not
to
at
least
like
this
beer
utterly
drinkable
but
never
boring
id
have
no
problem
giving
some
to
my
coorsswilling
friends
looking
to
branch
out
into
craft
brews
yet
id
also
recommend
it
to
my
alcoholshy
mom
worth
revisiting
if
the
price
is
right
d
low
abv
as
expected
with
these
stouts
and
taste
isnt
exceedingly
overwhelming
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
and
clear
liquid
into
the
glass
i
chilled
the
beer
a
bit
more
than
i
would
normally
as
it
was
a
hot
day
the
only
real
downside
is
that
the
beer
is
just
a
bit
sweet
something
i
typically
dont
care
for
in
a
beer
better
than
most
stouts
except
for
a
few
chocolate
stouts
ive
had
this
stout
had
a
bit
of
choc
itself
quite
a
nice
dry
stout
fairly
roasty
and
chocolatey
with
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
for
a
5
stout
pours
very
dark
brown
near
black
with
a
creamy
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
smells
roasty
creamy
and
a
touch
nutty
but
all
in
balance
and
not
too
assertively
roasted
but
enough
to
create
a
nice
toasty
note
taste
is
similar
especially
creamy
and
a
bit
nutty
with
just
enough
roastiness
to
give
it
some
flavor
a
bit
of
light
lingering
bitterness
as
well
extremely
creamy
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
very
pleasant
session
beer
and
quite
a
nice
dry
stout
drinkability
paired
well
with
the
movie
the
quiet
man
though
id
like
to
see
how
this
fares
under
a
nitrotap
its
still
enjoyable
in
bomber
bottle
form
id
prefer
a
hair
more
body
and
creaminess
but
its
acceptable
as
is
at
least
it
isnt
guilty
of
what
so
many
selflabeled
dry
stouts
are
having
almost
no
flavor

this
is

overall
this

has
good
flavor
for
a

abv
stout
the
kinda
thing
that
should
be
able
to
put
guinness
in
its
place
but
never
will
definitely
lacks
any
chalkiness
or
earthy
tones
from
the
hops
but
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
not
sure
if
the
flavors
would
come
on
too
strong
to
session
the

possibly
keeps
some
of

this
is
a
very

sessionable
stout

its
even
better
on

overall
this
was
a
very
solid
low
alch
stout
that
is
very
easy
drinking
much
better
from
the
nitro
tap
at
the
brewery
not
only
does
it
make
it
feel
thicker
and
creamier
on
the
mouth
but
i
think
it
brings
more
to
the
nose
and
perhaps
the
taste
dominated
with
roasted
coffee
a
slight
bit
of
smoke
and
some
cocoa
the
taste
has
an
underlying
caramel
cocoa
and
coffee
with
some
smoke
and
a
bit
of
burnt
flavor
from
black
patent
the
mouthfeel
is
greatly
improved
from
the

overall
a
very
good
stout
what
is
most
impressive
is
the
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
o
incredibly
drinkable
stout
packs
a
punch
in
both
smell
and
taste
especially
for
such
a
small
beer
in
terms
of
abv
fresh
from
a
trip
to
the
uk
i
can
confidently
say
that
onward
is
as
good
as
any
sessionable
stout
that
i
sampled
while
there
drinkability
is
fantastic
easy
going
and
inviting
this
one
just
begs
for
a
second
glass
before
the
first
is
even
halfway
done
an
entire
growler
of
this
over
the
course
of
an
evening
would
be
no
problem
very
happy
with
this
one
d
pretty
good
it
has
a
pretty
smooth
taste
flavorful
with
a
clean
finish
could
have
a
few
of
these
i
would
personally
like
to
see
yazoo
do
an
oatmeal
stout
rather
than
the
irish
stout
but
it
certainly
is
good
easily
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
ever
had
its
a
shame
this
hasnt
made
it
to
widespread
distribution
and
is
only
available
at
the
taproom
and
a
few
bars
around
nashville
its
easily
one
of
yazoos
better
brews
i
was
terribly
disappointed
that
there
was
no
way
to
take
any
home
with
me
drinkability
is
a
tough
one
it
is
quite
flavorful
i
want
to
rate
this
as
being
very
drinkable
but
i
need
to
have
more
than
1
and
12
of
these
to
judge
if
the
flavor
becomes
too
much
although
rich
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
i
only
wish
i
could
have
left
with
a
few
growlers
of
it
however
i
was
told
that
due
to
it
being
a
nitro
stout
that
they
were
unable
to
do
so
fairly
nondescript
here
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
either
just
ok
md
thin
bodied
and
an
almost
flat
feeling
just
does
not
feel
like
a
stout
in
the
mouth
decent
taste
which
does
make
it
drinkable
but
i
feel
it
is
much
better
on
standard
tap
thanks
for
introducing
me
to
the
yazoo
brewing
company
unclejedi
little
to
no
head
in
the
one
i
tried
but
i
think
that
was
because
the
bartendress
over
filled
it
i
did
get
a
tan
ring
to
form
dark
in
color
but
you
can
pick
up
a
little
ruby
color
even
in
its
center
yep
it
looks
irish
anyway
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
it
almost
seems
like
a
darker
roast
that
is
in
some
stouts
the
coffee
malt
was
quite
bitter
i
think
that
is
what
stood
out
most
about
this
beer
to
me
there
is
a
slight
hop
zing
in
the
background
i
felt
like
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
gritty
no
so
much
chewy
or
creamy
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
i
would
put
this
beer
in
the
worth
a
try
category
but
i
wouldnt
revisit
it
a
lot
of
all
the
beers
in
the
sampler
served
at
their
taproom
i
anticipated
liking
this
one
the
most
and
was
sorely
disappointed
the
beer
poured
with
an
opacity
and
creamy
tan
head
that
were
true
to
the
stout
stylealthough
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
dry
irish
stout
the
predominant
smell
was
one
of
charcoal
which
was
my
first
hint
that
i
would
not
care
for
this
beer
no
other
scents
could
be
detected
due
to
the
overall
burnt
character
both
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
ive
tasted
and
enjoyed
smoked
porters
and
stouts
before
but
they
were
much
milder
than
this
it
literally
tasted
as
though
liquid
smoke
was
added
to
the
glass
i
dont
think
storage
temperature
or
age
were
to
blame
as
it
was
sampled
at
the
brewers
taproom
so
i
have
to
assume
that
it
was
a
legit
representation
of
their
beer
im
much
more
a
porterstout
fan
than
a
hophead
and
i
literally
had
to
choke
down
the
small
sampler
glass
i
spent
2
weeks
in
ireland
last
summer
and
through
exhaustive
personal
research
really
got
a
feel
for
what
a
proper
pint
of
irish
stout
should
taste
like
this
wasnt
it
stick
with
the
sly
rye
porter
dos
perros
or
the
pale
ale
when
visiting
yazoo
i
will
be
in
nashville
soon
and
will
give
it
a
2nd
chance
ill
update
if
hopefully
change
is
noted
drinkability
i
hate
to
rain
on
this
parade
of
accolades
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
local
beers
but
this
is
an
unimpressive
stout
really
more
like
a
porter
if
the
truth
be
told
i
had
high
expectations
and
saved
this
one
for
the
last
of
the
four
yazoo
brews
i
tasted
on
my
nashville
trip
but
i
cannot
say
that
any
one
of
them
passed
muster
in
my
view
a
real
shame
as
the
brewery
is
trying
some
unusual
recipes
but
all
of
their
beers
seem
to
lack
body
drinkability
a
good
drinker
that
i
would
have
a
few
times
a
week
i
could
easily
drink
a
growler
of
this
stuff
and
never
get
bored
some
beers
i
feel
like
the
full
impact
of
them
is
only
on
the
first
sip
and
smell
this
one
keeps
on
challenging
the
palate
and
rewarding
subsequent
pours
onward
stout
what
can
be
said
about
this
beer
that
will
serve
it
justice
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
it
has
a
nice
tan
head
and
is
almost
jet
black
in
appearance
it
has
got
a
great
coffee
flavor
and
exceptional
mouth
feel
i
know
a
lot
of
people
try
this
at
the
flying
saucer
but
if
you
get
a
chance
try
it
from
the
source
you
will
be
even
more
impressed
by
this
amazing
beer
a
very
tasty
stout
not
the
best
ive
tried
but
definitely
worth
drinking
another
time
very
interesting
stout
certainly
not
as
heavy
as
an
imperial
but
quite
complex
very
smooth
with
strong
coffee
and
malt
tastes
it
almost
reminded
me
of
a
cup
of
espresso
especially
in
the
little
5oz
glass
in
the
buildyourown
sampler
at
nashvilles
flying
saucer
appearance
was
a
nice
dark
black
but
the
subdued
lighting
in
the
bar
made
it
difficult
to
discern
subtleties
about
the
appearance
smell
was
not
as
strong
as
i
normally
enjoy
but
a
larger
glassful
in
a
quieter
setting
may
be
more
revealing
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
certainly
recommend
if
you
can
find
it
had
this
on
tap
in
nashville
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
chocolate
and
a
little
coffee
good
malt
character
the
brewer
told
us
he
uses
english
pale
malt
roasted
barley
black
patent
and
flaked
barley
for
this
one
along
with
ekgoldings
and
target
hops
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
has
a
great
finish
great
beer
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
creamyness
and
dry
tartness
spoton
for
the
style
a
very
prominent
smoked
malt
flavor
ive
never
had
an
opportunity
to
smell
burning
peat
so
i
dont
know
if
that
is
what
was
used
but
this
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
hardwood
smoke
maple
burned
in
a
fireplace
comes
to
mind
the
smoked
malt
while
fairly
assertive
is
not
overdone
and
adds
a
nice
depth
to
the
beer
very
nicely
done
this
irish
stout
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
short
lived
tan
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
robust
blend
of
chocolate
coffee
and
malt
it
is
reminiscent
of
guiness
not
the
bottle
but
fresh
and
on
tap
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
more
porter
than
stout
the
flavor
is
a
typical
stout
quality
but
has
a
metallic
quality
that
is
a
turn
off
this
is
good
and
if
pushed
a
touch
further
could
be
great
get
the
publican
porter
instead
if
you
can
overall
good
beer
not
a
very
heavy
beer
but
this
beer
still
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
being
a
lighter
beer
you
get
more
of
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
that
is
crisp
but
not
so
heavy
and
full
like
a
stronger
stout
o
not
really
any
noticeable
flaws
here
pretty
spot
on
for
the

very

a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
this
was
a
bit
too
burnt
or
smoky
for
my
taste
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
want
a
stout
with
a
lower
abv
overall
decent
brew
from
shorts
nothing
i
could
get
excited
about
but
good
to
have
around
st
pats
day
o
well
i
bought
i
impulse
bought
this
to
support
a
local
brewery
and
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
personally
and
my
loyalty
did
not
disappoint
me
one
bit
recommended
by
me
overall
not
the
most
impressive
beer
but
by
no
means
bad
if
you
can
get
it
on
draft
or
a
single
bottle
give
it
a
go
great
representation
of
the
style
i
am
not
the
worlds
biggest
stout
fans
and
when
i
do
partake
i
prefer
milkier
stouts
but
the
flavor
here
is
spot
on
especially
appreciable
on
a
cold
late
winter
day
in
michigan
my
only
real
complaint
which
may
be
erroneous
is
that
the
beer
is
a
bit
fizzy
i
always
associate
stouts
with
a
flatter
feel
anyway
a
great
choice
for
a
classic
stout
a
super
solid
beer
that
like
others
have
said
is
better
than
guinness
in
every
aspect
except
maybe
the
appearance
its
hard
to
beat
guinness
in
my
opinion
uncle
steves
is
just
a
solid
stout
all
around
try
it
if
you
havent
already
great
session
beer
seen
this
at
local
meijers
store
on
sale
and
picked
up
a
six
pack
this
beer
has
rich
dark
stout
flavor
with
almost
chocolate
back
end
taste
to
it
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
you
could
easily
enjoy
this
paired
with
fish
and
chips
as
i
did
overall
a
bit
better
than
i
remember
it
being
i
could
knock
back
six
of
these
no
problem
a
tasty
irish
style
stout
with
a
nice
bitter
roast
aroma
and
flavor
this
is
a
nice
hearty
stout
seems
a
bit
too
hearty
for
the
style
nice
roasted
tones
with
a
thick
body
good
complexities
i
still
think
its
a
bit
too
much
for
the
style
again
another
shorts
beer
that
is
quite
good
but
doesnt
quite
fit
to
style
a
magnificent
dry
stout
and
definitely
a
beer
id
recommend
o
this
is
a
nice
irish
stout
uncle
steve
should
be
happy
with
this
beer
is
very
true
to
the
style
full
of
roast
and
biscuit
with
a
slight
hop
this
comes
out
a
black
cola
color
with
dark
cocoa
foam
very
tight
bubbles
and
a
thick
strong
coffee
roast
aroma
on
the
nose
the
coffee
dominates
but
it
is
not
exclusively
so
balanced
out
by
chocolate
the
flavor
is
all
about
dark
chocolate
dark
roast
coffee
and
a
sharp
hop
bitterness
for
definition
its
full
bodied
thick
and
robust
i
dig
it
fantastic
i
thought
the
easiest
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
to
compare
it
to
a
guiness
which
i
would
consider
the
standard
for
an
irish
stout
if
it
truly
is
i
have
no
idea
i
think
this
brew
from
shorts
stacks
up
favorably
there
are
many
similar
characteristics
the
malt
aroma
bitterness
is
all
very
similar
i
would
say
this
beer
has
a
bit
more
going
for
it
the
head
is
frothy
rather
than
creamy
and
the
taste
is
a
little
more
acidic
rather
than
smooth
it
has
a
nuttiness
to
it
almost
like
roasted
pecans
the
moutfeel
is
medium
and
drinkable
i
let
this
beer
warm
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
and
its
flavor
profile
held
true
throughout
i
will
say
that
it
became
softer
with
warmth
more
drinkable
but
thats
not
to
say
it
was
boozy
from
the
start
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
great
every
day
stout
im
glad
they
come
in
six
packs
overall
a
great
stout
from
another
recent
favorite
of
michigan
beers
o
while
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
still
pretty
good
for
the
money
o
flavor
profile
is
nice
but
the
high
carbonation
reduces
the
overall
enjoyment
still
pretty
good
though
o
not
really
a
fan
it
seemed
a
bit
thin
and
i
just
didnt
really
like
the
flavor
combination
made
well
just
not
for
me
o
shorts
didnt
screw
up
with
this
brew
but
they
made
what
i
would
consider
one
of
their
most
average
offerings
i
enjoyed
it
without
dobut
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
o
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
flavorful
yet
drinkable
its
screaming
to
get
matched
with
irish
fare
i
could
sit
down
and
put
back
a
bunch
of
these
a
very
sociable
drink
i
had
some
initial
worries
that
this
might
be
a
bit
out
of
season
and
bottling
this
style
seems
to
ruin
it
for
me
any
worries
were
laid
to
rest
definitely
exceded
expectations
o
a
very
delightful
drink
relaxing
brew
i
would
love
to
see
this
brew
come
in
a
can
good
brew
in
a
good
trade
thanks
another6pack
cant
wait
until
round
two
overall
this
is
my
first
from
shorts
due
to
where
i
live
and
im
very
impressed
this
is
a
flavorful
and
drinkable
treat
o
quite
good
i
didnt
have
any
expectations
when
i
went
in
but
i
was
impressed
by
what
a
flavorful
beer
this
turned
out
to
be
o
this
beer
was
a
fantastic
surprise
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
little
offness
to
it
in
a
good
shorts
kind
of
way
and
found
a
well
balanced
beer
the
abv
is
a
nice
lower
number
so
enjoying
a
sixer
of
this
is
very
much
in
the
cards
another
great
beer
from
shorts
the
cpj
pours
black
very
little
fading
in
color
topped
with
a
thin
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
this
beer
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
follows
quite
nicely
more
bitter
chocolate
nice
amount
of
roast
and
a
dab
of
coffee
medium
body
mediumlow
carbonation
and
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
a
tasty
stout
and
sessionably
smooth
update
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
the
2012
release
its
one
awesome
beer
and
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
irish
dry
stout
i
am
going
to
have
to
stockpile
some
before
they
are
all
gone
overall
good
not
great
smoke
a
bit
too
forward
for
my
taste
o
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
style
and
this
was
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
nothing
earthshattering
here
but
still
a
nice
sessionable
drinker
pretty
decent
brew
not
anything
that
stands
out
as
amazing
but
was
worth
having
d
very
drinkable
would
be
a
great
session
stout
not
too
strong
and
for
someone
who
loves
stouts
would
go
down
smoothly
i
see
that
it
has
overall
listed
instead
of
drinkability
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
when
it
comes
to
an
american
brewery
making
an
irish
dry
stout
i
would
recommend
avery
out
of
bounds
stout
over
this
ook
overall
slightly
heavier
than
i
was
expecting
d
id
take
a
guinness
but
nice
to
try
a
different
offering
from
the
style
this
version
of
the
style
really
works
for
me
nice
body
flavor
and
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
d
i
think
i
got
an
infected
bottle
but
this
one
just
tasted
bad
i
feel
like
every
other
bottle
i
get
from
shorts
is
infected
i
would
never
drink
this
again
drinkability
because
it
is
lighter
bodied
it
is
damn
easy
to
quaff
i
was
not
expecting
much
going
into
this
beer
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
though
it
isnt
my
favorite
stout
it
is
definitely
worth
a
drink
d
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
taste
is
good
i
am
always
excited
to
try
a
beer
from
shorts
that
ive
never
had
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
i
would
try
it
again
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
very
good
either
too
thin
and
weak
i
think
my
review
is
actually
being
kind
because
i
dont
really
like
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
definitely
bordering
in
on
black
light
and
thin
tan
head
that
recedes
pretty
quickly
with
only
a
bit
of
lace
to
show
for
it
the
nose
brings
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
along
with
a
bit
of
roasted
coffee
the
taste
is
really
highly
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
small
dose
of
coffee
nice
dry
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
given
that
i
have
come
to
expect
beers
from
shorts
to
be
so
i
was
unsurprised
by
the
infection
in
this
bottle
it
actually
sort
of
works
here
as
well
not
bad
and
if
you
want
to
taste
a
dark
sour
beer
that
sort
of
works
then
give
this
one
a
go
if
you
want
a
nice
irish
stout
then
i
can
only
recommend
that
you
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
at
least
it
is
interesting
this
beer
tastes
extremely
good
for
the
style
more
like
an
imperial
dry
stout
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
a
little
bit
sweet
in
the
front
and
a
long
aftertaste
of
roast
and
cafe
thicker
than
normal
body
but
not
as
thick
as
say
your
average
ris
i
liked
this
overall
more
than
many
of
the
shorts
beers
ive
tried
lately
overall
a
solid
stout
but
needed
a
little
more
punch
to
make
it
last
in
my
mind
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
huge
3
finger
fluffy
tan
head
that
is
very
slow
to
settle
aroma
that
i
get
out
of
this
is
a
little
bit
of
coffee
but
also
leather
and
roast
matls
mediumlight
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
big
leather
and
slightly
bitter
ending
ends
rather
crisply
and
dry
but
the
flavors
linger
on
a
bit
good
lace
left
on
the
glass
has
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
taste
hmm
not
a
huge
fan
but
not
terrible
either
pretty
carbonated
definitely
a
different
take
on
an
irish
stout
here
with
the
tart
fruity
tang
of
this
really
standing
out
it
wasnt
necessarily
unpleasant
but
just
different
as
the
other
aspects
of
this
were
mostly
well
done
im
curious
as
to
just
how
different
this
one
ended
up
being
in
the
bottle
overall
drink
this
beer
semi
cold
i
through
my
first
one
in
the
freezer
for
10
minutes
when
it
was
already
somewhat
cold
and
it
had
a
funky
fruity
sour
taste
when
it
warms
up
this
beer
has
potential
it
just
walks
a
thin
line
really
dry
will
never
buy
this
again
ill
give
irish
dry
stouts
another
try
but
if
theyre
all
like
this
then
im
good
d
not
sure
im
feeling
the
style
very
much
maybe
the
beer
had
to
still
chill
for
a
bit
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
dont
need
to
seek
this
one
out
jet
black
color
though
somewhat
muddy
looking
nice
head
and
leaves
a
layer
of
lace
at
each
sip
mellow
somewhat
roasted
and
mildly
cocoa
aroma
decent
flavoragain
mild
roasted
and
cocoa
flavors
pleasantly
dry
with
a
definate
grainy
taste
to
it
licoricesourness
flavors
come
thru
near
the
end
and
tend
to
be
too
much
overall
solid
mouthfeel
decent
stout
though
the
somewhat
off
taste
of
whatever
flavor
i
am
getting
would
make
too
many
of
these
hard
to
swallow
pours
black
with
big
initial
beige
foam
that
tapers
off
to
leaving
some
thick
lace
in
the
glass
coffee
astringency
up
front
sourness
on
the
back
end
with
sugar
more
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
dry
aftertaste
flavours
going
on
and
that
keeps
me
drinking
for
interest
some
anise
big
burping
carbonation
yet
this
is
8
months
aged
you
sold
iti
rate
it
and
the
sourness
may
be
attributable
to
an
oops
infection
batch
and
it
is
more
evident
in
the
aromas
at
the
end
of
the
glass
along
with
roast
overall
a
decent
dry
stout
however
i
think
that
this
one
went
a
bit
sour
pretty
drinkable
just
sour
in
the
aftertaste
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
toss
back
a
few
with
ease
uncle
steve
knows
whats
happening
worth
a
shot
overall
an
decent
irish
dry
stout
wasnt
in
love
with
this
beer
but
worth
a
try
if
you
are
partial
to
the
style
12
oz
bottle
into
my
rochefort
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
not
black
but
you
could
be
fooled
that
it
is
light
tan
head
gone
right
away
super
light
aroma
a
little
light
coffee
but
thats
it
the
taste
is
super
light
and
sweet
on
the
front
on
the
finish
some
very
light
coffee
just
not
a
ton
of
flavor
here
a
light
coffee
sessional
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
typical
opaque
dark
with
beige
head
the
real
joy
of
this
beer
is
in
the
aroma
rich
musky
roasted
malt
house
blend
coffee
a
touch
of
cocoa
powder
flavor
is
pleasant
and
mild
of
java
and
dry
chocolate
cake
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
and
a
little
metallic
in
the
finish
this
makes
the
beer
quite
drinkable
pretty
drinkable
nothing
outstanding
but
one
i
would
drink
again
worth
a
try
for
sure
a
dark
black
pour
with
a
foamy
light
tan
head
leaving
some
jagged
lacing
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
coffee
coco
powder
roasted
malt
and
earhty
hops
flavor
is
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
light
coffee
lots
of
roasted
malt
coco
powder
and
earthy
hops
light
body
oily
feel
with
a
short
dry
roasty
finish
drinkable
and
sessionable
but
not
my
favorite
style
shorts
makes
some
good
beers
but
they
are
too
hit
and
miss
in
the
quality
control
department
for
me
if
they
can
start
putting
out
beers
that
arent
infected
they
will
move
up
in
my
book
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
that
i
received
from
tastetester
and
hope
that
it
isnt
infected
like
this
one
was
d
i
could
drink
this
one
again
irish
stouts
arent
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
good
from
notes
deep
dark
brown
pour
with
eggshell
head
and
some
nice
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
dark
malts
and
a
bit
of
smoke
smooth
first
sip
is
smooth
with
a
mellow
dark
roast
and
some
with
a
nuttiness
a
bit
dry
with
a
touch
of
smoke
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
medium
bodied
smooth
and
a
bit
dry
overall
an
interesting
take
on
an
irish
stout
but
i
wouldnt
expect
less
from
shorts
second
bottle
consumed
on
92110
has
been
in
the
fridge
and
has
a
very
pronounced
sourness
from
start
to
finish
definitely
takes
away
from
the
irish
stoutness
but
makes
this
stout
a
little
more
refreshing
on
a
summers
day
d
ya
i
am
definitely
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
6
pack
of
it
i
usually
really
shorts
beer
but
this
is
a
big
miss
for
me
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
a
long
shot
but
not
my
favorite
definitely
sessionable
and
ill
have
no
trouble
drinking
the
other
five
in
my
fridge
d
the
smooth
and
lightness
of
the
stout
lends
to
a
very
good
drinkability
the
avg
abv
would
make
this
a
good
session
beer
especially
for
the
prest
pattys
weekend
good
easy
drinking
irish
stout
highly
carbonated
and
very
roasty
bascially
tasted
just
like
it
smells
with
a
bit
more
in
the
way
of
dark
fruit
body
is
light
and
watery
like
all
irish
stouts
such
a
boring
style
but
okay
once
a
year
has
a
low
abv
and
is
pretty
drinkable
and
seems
very
smooth
a
decent
irish
stout
but
not
quite
up
to
some
other
shorts
brewery
stouts
all
in
all
this
brew
smelled
a
lot
better
than
it
tasted
it
had
a
lot
of
potential
brewer
just
needs
to
work
on
the
flavors
a
little
more
good
brew
to
try
once
but
not
worth
hunting
down
if
you
cant
get
it
locally

this
is
just
about
as
easy
to
drink
but
tastier
than
guinness
very
well
done
i
was
a
bit
nervous
to
get
a
seriously
infected
bottle
but
luckily
enough
it
wasnt
too
bad
a
good
offering
from
shorts
and
i
trust
they
will
fix
the
qc
issues
in
the
future
edit
just
drank
another
bottle
of
this
one
and
it
was
very
good
no
sign
of
the
sourness
in
the
earlier
bottle
and
a
nice
highly
roasted
stout
d
low
abv
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
a
sold
irish
dry
stout
while
i
had
a
poor
experience
with
this
beer
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
shorts
brewings
response
to
these
qc
issues
i
am
not
telling
anyone
that
this
beer
is
horrible
as
much
as
this
batch
had
its
share
of
problems
i
look
forward
to
another
batch
and
an
updated
review
thanks
to
shorts
for
reaching
out
and
offering
to
make
this
right
classy
act
for
sure
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
smooth
and
tasty
a
nice
irish
stout
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
easy
drinking
stout
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
for
the
style
but
real
nice
roasty
flavours
going
on
thanks
russ
d
while
its
not
terrible
its
gonna
be
a
drain
pour
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
infection
crap
from
them
despite
their
best
efforts
at
a
good
beer
which
otherwise
it
would
be
taste
was
over
the
top
roastymalty
with
a
long
finish
this
is
way
too
much
stout
for
a
style
exemplified
by
guiness
murphys
reminded
me
of
a
misplaced
homebrew
d
very
good
stout
very
drink
able
its
really
nice
to
see
a
brewery
get
that
amount
of
flavor
in
a
beer
without
going
crazy
on
the
alcohol
very
roasty
almost
burnt
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
dark
bitter
malt
character
slightly
lactic
and
creamy
with
a
lot
of
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
oatmeal
toffee
roasted
coffee
bean
and
burnt
wood
theres
also
a
very
prominent
hop
bitterness
especially
toward
the
end
of
the
palate
which
lingers
into
a
very
acrid
dry
finish
sweet
alcohol
is
present
mid
palate
lasting
through
the
finish
but
there
is
a
bit
of
silky
viscous
burnt
chocolate
maltiness
in
the
end
of
the
swallow
this
beer
isnt
as
smooth
or
creamy
as
it
claims
to
be
and
overall
this
beer
has
a
really
harsh
acridburnt
character
that
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
one
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
this
one
at
least
has
some
flavor
though
like
most
the
mouthfeel
is
off
for
beer
and
it
appears
to
be
infected
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
d
this
beer
would
be
great
to
drink
several
of
while
watching
rugby
darts
soccer
or
some
other
western
european
sport
d
a
good
stout
that
definitely
satisfies
when
guinness
is
just
not
enough
nice
job
shorts
overall
im
liking
dry
stouts
more
and
more
and
this
one
fits
right
in
mouthfeel
too
thin
a
nice
little
dry
stout
from
shorts
irish
stouts
are
rarely
as
robust
as
their
bigger
brethren
but
uncle
steves
provides
plenty
of
interest
for
its
unaggressive
profile
a
tasty
winter
session
option
dlow

better
than
the
imported
guinness
es
cheers
d
a
great
example
of
a
dry
irish
stout
well
done
but
not
extraordinary
dark
rich
malts
and
bakers
chocolate
flavors
are
the
first
to
introduce
themselves
in
the
flavors
in
the
middle
it
takes
on
something
akin
to
dark
fruits
and
green
apple
the
finish
is
quite
interesting
with
a
cool
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
but
still
finishes
with
a
dryness
that
is
expected
from
any
proper
irish
stout
for
a
seasonal
it
may
be
somewhat
appropriate
but
for
such
a
rare
thing
to
find
in
bottle
form
it
seems
somewhat
lackluster
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
just
not
at
all
worth
its
price
tag
overall
a
classic
interpretation
on
an
irish
dry
stout
deadon
chalky
dryness
with
enough
malt
traction
to
keep
ones
stout
satisfaction
level
at
a
high
mark
great
stout
from
shorts
indeed
simple
and
classic
d
quite
drinkable
and
spot
on
for
the
style
alcohol
is
nonexistent
in
the
taste
taste
is
not
very
complex
or
interesting
however
had
this
after
a
cup
a
joe
so
it
was
a
bit
tough
to
compete
though
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
it
is
an
excellent
beer
d
irish
dry
stouts
arent
always
my
favorites
but
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
totally
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
it
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
at
holiday
market
in
royal
oak
im
not
usually
a
dry
stout
fan
but
figured
id
give
this
a
shot
and
it
didnt
disappoint
pours
a
drystoutdarkbrown
with
a
fair
bit
of
tan
head
smells
of
burnt
charred
malts
taste
is
as
expected
quite
dry
again
those
burnt
malts
a
tad
of
caramel
and
dark
roasted
coffee
mouthfeel
is
that
astringent
dry
quality
youd
expect
from
a
dry
stout
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
great
for
a
cold
winter
night
d
a
good
drinking
beer
that
doesnt
seem
to
pack
too
big
of
a
punch
clean
and
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
the
drinkability
is
good
with
all
style
points
considered
not
every
enthusiast
can
sit
down
and
serially
consume
a
stout
of
any
style
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
thumbs
up
for
shorts
below
the
increasing
quality
of
recent
saranac
beers
this
one
a
thin
and
slightly
off
irish
stout
not
as
dry
as
it
should
be
lacking
any
meaty
body
and
frankly
just
not
all
that
appealing
lighter
brown
for
the
style
more
of
a
brown
ale
really
or
a
light
porter
than
a
true
irish
stout
in
looks
and
the
flavor
is
similarly
watered
down
the
body
is
real
thin
and
there
is
a
peculiar
metallic
bitterness
all
the
way
through
it
i
may
be
a
little
biased
as
this
was
my
last
beer
in
an
evening
of
several
world
class
ones
but
i
was
still
let
down
by
this
seemingly
lazy
offering
anyone
who
sips
this
notices
inadequacies
right
away
namely
the
lack
of
body
but
also
the
longer
semi
sweet
finish
the
minimal
carbonation
and
the
partially
oxidized
taste
in
the
finish
saranac
has
really
been
coming
out
with
some
top
notch
stuff
lately
inventive
and
well
executed
but
this
is
the
worst
ive
had
from
them
in
some
time
and
is
probably
at
least
part
of
the
reason
true
beer
geeks
keep
bashing
this
brand
barely
passable
as
the
style
it
proclaims
to
be
just
a
bit
better
as
a
dark
ale
but
not
one
i
need
to
try
again
for
awhile
notes
a
decent
looking

balanced
finishes
dry
and
subtly
tangy
and
roasty
overall
impressive
there
are
a
lot
of
breweries
that
have
taken
a
stab
at
the
style
and
many
have
missed
the
mark
not
saranac
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
works
well
in
this
mix
pack
to
provide
some
variation
wouldnt
seek
it
out
on
its
own
but
is
one
of
the
quickest
to
go
in
the
pack
overall
decent
very
smooth
and
drinkable
would
like
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
since
this
beer
is
a
tad
more
sweeter
and
then
most
irish
stouts
a
little
weak
in
flavor
overall
but
still
enjoyable
this
looks
a
bit
better
than
it
tastes
but
its
not
super
underwhelming
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
through
and
through
but
still
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
the
taste
is
basically
the
same
in
the
roasted
department
but
adds
a
piney
bitterness
to
it
also
interestingly
enough
the
drink
is
dry
but
its
also
slightly
watery
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
by
itself
although
i
did
enjoy
it
poured
into
mug
pours
dark
and
thick
looking
nice
amount
of
head
that
fades
quickly
light
caramel
aroma
with
chocolate
and
booze
flavor
has
a
bit
of
bacon
ashy
a
little
hoppy
a
bit
of
a
wet
finish
has
a
nice
bite
to
it
its
a
bit
harsh
with
alcohol
burn
for
such
a
low
percentage
o
a
great
dry
stout
should
be
dry
and
substantial
this
is
just
dry
as
a
guinness
alternative
this
is
solid
as
an
alternative
to
other
craft
stouts
this
comes
up
short
overall
it
is
a
tasty
brew
but
seems
more
of
cross
between
dry
stout
and
american
stout
a
fairly
dry
roasty
beer
with
lots
of
malt
dominance
theres
a
bit
of
an
acrid
character
that
is
a
touch
offputting
overall
good
beer
to
have
wouldnt
replace
my
usual
irish
stouts
but
definitely
not
a
disappointment
salud
this
was
a
basic
dry
stout
i
was
a
little
taken
back
by
just
how
thin
the
body
was
it
seemed
on
the
edge
of
almost
being
a
schwarzbier
with
some
extra
dryness
notes
fun
easy
to
drink
a
winner
for
matt
brewing
imo
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
browntoblack
coloring
with
light
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
and
a
thin
sparse
light
tan
coating
on
the
surface
aromas
of
mocha
coffee
with
a
slight
sugary
ribbon
to
the
chocolate
character
and
a
touch
of
earthy
characteristics
flavors
of
roast
and
char
initially
with
a
slick
bitter
coffee
backbone
quickly
following
some
bitter
chocolate
highlights
but
not
as
much
as
the
nose
would
lead
you
to
believe
aftertaste
is
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
strong
bitter
undertone
light
dry
body
with
a
slick
quick
finish
true
to
the
style
but
a
little
more
chocolatey
and
rich
than
you
may
be
used
to
tasty
personal
rate
3
5
bottom
line
good
decent
stout
but
it
doesnt
take
it
to
the
next
level
a
solid
effort
o
this
beer
has
two
things
working
against
it
coming
out
of
the
gate
first
its
an
irish
dry
stout
a
style
of
beer
that
most
americans
dont
seem
to
understand
or
appreciate
second
its
brewed
by
saranac
a
brewery
that
doesnt
get
a
lot
of
love
and
has
a
reputation
in
the
craft
world
for
underachieving
and
making
mediocre
beer
for
these
reasons
i
dont
expect
it
to
get
a
lot
of
love
that
would
be
a
damn
shame
though
because
this
is
an
excellent
beer
in
fact
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
to
date
attractive
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
very
tasty
and
textbook
for
the
style
its
everything
you
could
ever
want
a
case
might
be
in
order
next
st
patricks
day
overall
a
solid
irish
stout
great
balance
of
roasted
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
overall
a
real
good
example
of
the
style
very
smooth
and
easy
drinkability
o
decent
stout
probably
will
have
again
in
the
future
very
dark
brown
basically
black
with
no
light
shining
through
on
this
one
at
all
rich
looking
head
of
tan
on
the
top
hung
around
for
most
of
the
session
the
aroma
was
a
bit
light
lots
of
roasted
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
cocoa
underneath
it
really
dry
taste
but
a
little
bland
for
me
light
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
but
it
lacked
alot
of
depth
to
put
it
over
the
top
into
another
cateogory
still
though
it
was
a
decent
little
stout
with
a
nice
feel
and
a
5
5
percent
very
drinkable
not
sure
i
would
go
here
again
though
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
dark
brown
color
its
almost
black
in
color
the
head
was
a
nice
creamy
looking
tan
color
and
left
a
decent
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
the
musty
earthy
roasted
aromas
going
on
the
taste
was
nicely
toasted
and
left
a
pretty
nice
bitterness
behind
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
overall
i
feel
that
the
beer
was
decent
the
body
could
have
been
a
bit
darker
it
was
almost
see
through
just
about
everything
was
mediocre
but
drinkable
d
this
is
my
first
offering
from
the
matt
brewing
company
its
a
solid
irish
dry
stout
but
perhaps
not
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
certainly
worth
a
try
and
im
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
it
o
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
especially
for
the
price
done
very
well
for
the
style
as
well
not
sure
on
the
age
of
this
but
it
still
seems
ok
to
me
maybe
not
for
long
though
probably
a
little
better
fresher
black
with
red
to
dark
amber
highlights
and
a
one
finger
head
smells
chocolatey
with
no
real
hop
presence
as
expected
for
style
pretty
dry
from
begining
to
end
roasty
but
not
smokey
taste
lingers
just
long
enough
a
little
thin
for
the
style
but
that
didnt
bother
me
so
much
because
that
made
it
more
of
a
hot
weather
stout
which
is
quite
appropriate
at
the
time
of
this
review
id
get
it
again
good
inexpensive
beer
which
i
would
buy
definitely
again
o
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
irish
stout
id
get
some
more
for
a
good
inexpensive
sessionable
stout
a
sweeter
version
of
a
dry
irish
stout
black
body
with
a
creamy
head
a
whiff
of
smoke
not
so
dry
and
in
fact
a
decent
tastiness
and
drinkability
half
decent
mouthfeel
a
tad
watery
and
a
bit
of
caramel
to
give
it
some
feel
if
stuck
i
would
have
it
again
thanks
radek
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
enjoyable
stout
that
i
would
definately
buy
again
overall
i
loved
this
beer
and
give
it
an
a
minus
i
compare
it
to
a
guiness
stout
but
a
much
better
price
and
it
is
brewed
locally
here
in
ny
omaybe
i
was
ruined
by
the
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
but
this
is
ok
at
best
d
very
drinkable
nice
balance
of
smooth
and
creamy
elements
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
weak
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
its
st
patricks
day
so
what
better
to
review
than
an
irish
stout
poured
pitch
black
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
a
foamy
cream
head
has
good
retention
and
leaves
bits
of
lace
the
hyper
fizzy
body
masks
the
flavors
a
bit
letting
the
beer
breathe
helps
calm
things
down
flavors
are
not
that
great
to
me
bitter
coffee
is
the
theme
here
roasted
flavors
dominate
but
arent
helped
by
much
else
things
get
acidic
in
the
finish
overall
this
didnt
do
it
for
me
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
overall
considering
the
trainwreck
that
the
imperial
stout
is
i
was
skeptical
trying
this
one
out
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
well
done
this
one
is
by
saranac
its
not
overly
chocolately
like
many
american
micros
and
seems
to
have
a
trueness
to
the
irish
stout
authentisty
with
well
balance
and
not
going
over
the
top
like
us
yank
brewers
tend
to
do
nice
job
saranac
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
packs
in
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
d
good
drinkability
and
def
could
drink
a
few
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
dry
and
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
and
a
great
light
aftertaste
that
is
there
for
a
short
time
then
is
gone
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
the
what
ales
you
mixed
12pk
pours
a
black
body
with
dark
brown
highlights
smells
like
a
guinness
dark
chocolate
roast
with
a
tinge
of
sourness
tastes
very
much
like
guinness
too
roasty
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
notes
with
nut
and
caramel
notes
in
the
background
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
not
bad
spoton
for
the
style
for
sure
a
tastier
and
cheaper
domestic
alternative
to
guinness
products
and
the
like
d
a
decent
stout
worthy
of
a
try
but
not
anything
particularly
world
class
not
as
strong
in
flavor
as
a
sierra
nevada
stout
but
does
have
its
own
set
of
rewarding
characteristics
making
it
a
worthy
brew
for
any
stout
lover
cheers
d
it
is
one
of
the
smoother
drinkable
stouts
that
i
have
had
i
would
drink
three
of
four
in
a
night
i
would
like
to
see
what
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
could
offer
like
any
saranac
these
are
worth
drinking
if
they
are
a
good
value
this
is
one
of
saranacs
better
offerings
and
a
great
take
on
a
lesser
loved
style
decent
drinkability
d
basically
if
you
were
to
compare
it
to
guinness
id
describe
it
as
essentially
the
taste
of
draught
with
almost
the
body
of
extra
a
nice
middle
ground
will
buy
this
again
coffee
flavors
up
front
then
carbonation
hits
in
the
back
with
some
bitter
spice
notes
followed
by
a
chocolate
coating
then
finishing
dry
with
a
hint
of
anise
appearance
is
that
of
a
solid
black
may
seem
even
more
so
than
guinness
but
not
as
creamy
looking
very
little
head
smells
of
mild
toasted
malt
and
mild
chocolate
and
espresso
taste
is
actually
drier
like
the
style
suggests
than
expected
but
full
of
roasted
malt
and
mild
coffee
mild
hops
help
this
beer
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
is
pretty
medium
bodied
and
drink
ability
is
also
very
good
since
i
love
stouts
a
very
solid
brew
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thick
long
lasting
tanned
head
nose
is
of
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malt
medium
very
sharp
body
roasted
malt
some
dark
fruit
and
some
off
sour
notes
fill
the
mouth
long
espresso
like
finish
so
so
stout
as
everything
from
saranac
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
pretty
decent
mild
stout
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
at
this
point
its
unlikely
that
the
matt
brewing
company
will
surprise
me
in
either
direction
irish
stout
is
a
serviceable
irish
dry
stout
that
was
worth
a
single
bottle
purchase
a
second
bottle
no
thanks
decent
stout
above
average
i
would
say
i
would
drink
this
again
maybe
too
heavy
to
drink
a
lot
of
though
pretty
drinkable
very
similar
to
sa
cream
stout
doesnt
have
the
drinkability
of
other
irish
drys
like
guinness
though
drinkability
could
have
two
or
three
of
these
one
of
saranacs
better
offerings
nice
dry
and
true
to
style
d
pretty
drinkable
a
lot
like
guinness
without
the
body
its
a
very
approachable
stout
there
are
no
overwhelming
flavors
that
would
turn
someone
away
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
coffee
taste
is
like
the
smell
roasted
malts
and
coffee
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
fine
quality
beer
d
the
smokey
flavor
makes
this
a
very
different
brew
worth
drinking
one
of
these
is
enough
i
love
a
good
stout
but
this
one
is
taken
over
completly
by
its
bitter
taste
overall
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
more
impressed
with
this
one
however
if
you
are
a
fan
of
irish
beer
or
irish
stouts
i
would
say
give
this
one
a
dry
it
has
a
little
less
alcohol
by
volume
than
i
expected
in
the
6
range
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
and
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
dark
ebony
with
a
whipped
creamt
tan
head
that
melts
slowly
leaving
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
good
black
malt
and
coffee
roastiness
the
flavor
is
spot
on
for
the
style
rich
roasty
black
malts
with
a
dry
coffee
like
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
and
slightly
chalky
with
a
dry
finish
slightly
harsh
carbonation
is
the
only
minor
complaint
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
an
easy
drinker
although
you
can
do
better
much
better
than
some
of
the
brewpub
ive
had
from
the
tap
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
and
nice
to
use
as
a
comparison
to
others
middle
of
the
road
but
actually
ok
drinkability
rates
high
certainly
more
flavorful
than
guinness
but
lacks
the
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
expected
for
the
style
still
quite
good
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
lighter
body
than
many
would
suspect
very
drinkable
irish
stout
from
a
perennial
favorite
brewery
of
mine
notes
overall
this
was
good
solid
dry
stout
i
am
a
fan
of
saranac
but
this
one
still
surprised
me
i
would
take
this
over
a
guinness
draught
any
day
d
not
bad
not
hefty
so
quite
sessionable
for
a
dry
stout
ok
but
very
mediocre
at
best
will
not
buy
again
d
sits
like
an
irish
stout
would
and
should
pretty
solid
take
on
this
style
by
saranac
theres
room
for
improvement
in
the
general
body
but
nothing
to
sweat
over
overall
a
very
good
dis
i
wish
this
was
a
year
round
offering
as
i
fear
i
enjoyed
one
of
the
last
kegs
around
in
any
event
it
is
good
to
see
a
saranac
beer
of
tap
on
long
island
as
they
are
few
are
far
between
happy
st
patrickss
day
d
a
nice
drink
again
maybe
not
as
dry
per
style
but
then
again
i
think
it
plays
to
its
advantage
drinkability
wise
giving
this
a
juicy
and
sweet
flair
on
the
tongue
that
gave
me
incentive
towards
the
next
sip
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
and
think
matt
did
a
good
job
picked
up
a
case
from
shangys
for
25
and
shared
it
with
friends
around
st
pats
day
saranac
did
a
good
job
of
brewing
a
tasty
guinnesslike
beer
but
ive
had
better
irish
stouts
while
theres
a
respectable
sourbitter
tang
i
would
have
liked
more
roast
and
chocolate
flavor
im
not
saying
it
needed
a
lot
im
just
saying
there
was
hardly
any
still
for
the
price
its
totally
worth
trying
if
you
like
stouts
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
more
complex
in
the
malt
taste
i
am
stretching
it
a
bit
pulling
all
sorts
of
things
out
of
its
simple
roasted
taste
i
could
see
this
being
better
with
slight
hints
of
caramel
vanilla
and
dark
chocolate
through
and
through
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
simple
stout
not
as
creamyperfect
as
you
know
what
but
quite
similar
this
has
a
little
more
bite
but
still
quite
mellow
and
drinkable
carbonated
to
keep
it
a
bit
more
crisp
than
expected
in
a
nice
way
but
still
smooth
and
creamy
i
like
the
snappy
bite
on
the
finish
a
bit
sour
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
adds
something
different
enough
to
stand
out
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
an
alright
stout
pours
a
very
dark
nearly
opaqe
brown
with
about
a
finger
of
tan
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
soapy
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
light
coffee
toffee
and
dark
wheat
the
taste
follows
straightforwardly
with
the
coffee
taking
a
darker
turn
and
placing
itself
further
toward
the
van
while
the
dark
malts
and
wheat
march
in

behind
the
finish
features
a
slight
cranberry
flavor
not
unlike
the
finish
youd
find
from
a
guinness
the
body
is
decidedly
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
smooth
dry
texture
overall
a
solid
if
somewhat
ordinary
stout

overall
good
beer
probably
best
one
ive
tasted
from
the
saranac
variety
pack
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
and
strong
tan
head
a
very
nice
looking
stout
some
roasted
grain
chocolate
cream
soda
sweetened
coffee
and
that
standard
saranac
musty
aroma
in
the
nose
light
in
body
with
a
semi
creamy
almost
buttery
texture
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
a
slight
bitterness
late
palate
does
its
job
into
the
finish
no
complaints
with
this
one
here
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
saranac
offering
very
drinkable
absolutely
sessionable
thought
the
irish
red
was
good
another
very
strong
seasonal
effort
from
saranac
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
12
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
and
creamy
black
malt
scent
thats
earthy
and
coffee
like
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
stiff
black
malt
bitterness
thats
dry
and
earthy
it
goes
down
smooth
and
relatively
light
and
finishes
bone
dry
with
a
creamy
coffee
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
irish
stout
its
not
gonna
blow
you
away
but
its
true
to
style
and
damn
drinkable
notes
i
bought
the
what
ales
you
12pack
after
grabbing
a
sixer
of
this
and
putting
it
back
wishing
now
id
bought
that
sixpack
and
had
more
than
one
remaining
might
just
be
the
best
saranac
beer
ive
had
as
far
as
nailing
the
style
goes
the
lacing
was
mediocre
at
best
but
this
was
a
very
good
stout
that
was
very
drinkable
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
like
stouts
as
this
is
spot
on
for
this
style
another
solid
addition
to
the
saranac
seasonal
collection
a
friend
brought
a
12
mix
pack
over
for
the
usacan
hockey
game
the
irish
stout
was
the
first
one
i
grabbed
as
i
dont
think
ive
tried
this
one
before
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
nice
fluffy
white
head
good
amount
of
lacing
a
great
start
to
the
first
beer
of
the
day
from
saranac
smell
had
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
taste
was
great
as
it
was
dry
and
crisp
but
also
had
a
bit
of
sweetness
of
cocoa
powder
and
sugary
coffee
not
as
thick
as
some
stouts
but
had
enough
body
to
satisfy
me
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
a
moderate
abv
id
buy
this
for
any
st
pattys
day
if
it
came
in
six
packs
deep
dark
appearance
it
does
let
some
ruby
highlights
through
when
held
toward
the
light
tan
khaki
head
builds
up
and
lasts
for
a
quite
a
few
minutes
before
dwindling
after
my
fist
sip
even
layers
of
fine
lacing
form
and
continue
to
trend
after
each
sip
aromatics
are
coming
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
bringing
out
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
tones
nothing
about
it
is
overbearingly
sweeet
maybe
a
slight
sour
mash
and
an
herbal
hop
presence
flavor
has
iced
coffee
like
presence
with
herbal
hops
and
a
hint
of
chicory
dark
dry
bakers
chocolate
and
a
tart
sour
dough
finish
this
is
an
excellent
dry
irish
stout
im
glad
fx
matt
attempted
this
drinkability
is
solid
i
hope
to
see
full
sixers
of
this
god
knows
we
love
the
pricing
of
their
beers
especialy
in
wv
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
quarter
inch
tan
head
that
faded
to
a
ring
and
a
modest
lace
smell
was
light
and
slightly
sweet
of
roasted
malt
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
good
carbonation
and
light
to
medium
body
a
lighter
version
of
a
guinness
extra
stout
would
be
a
good
session
beer
for
me
cheers
this
is
a
pretty
good
irish
stout
from
saranac
would
like
it
to
have
a
bit
more
roasted
character
which
is
overshadowed
on
the
tongue
by
the
hoppiness
of
the
beer
a
touch
out
of
balance
but
not
too
shabby
by
any
means
drinkability
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
besides
the
bottle
of
course
at
5
5
sis
is
a
little
higher
abv
than
this
style
usually
tops
out
at
with
that
being
said
it
is
still
very
drinkable
mfd
medium
bodied
and
creamy
went
down
well
i
would
have
this
one
again
matt
brewing
did
well
with
the
saranac
irish
stout
even
mouthfeel
not
too
full
a
bit
tingly
and
tannic
tasty
beer
pretty
drinkable
all
things
considered
i
think
this
is
excellent
only
loses
a
couple
points
in
the
head
retention
department
really
felt
the
need
to
review
this
beer
as
i
was
surprised
by
this
solid
offering
from
saranac
their
high
peaks
line
is
quite
good
but
everything
else
to
me
has
been
quite
average
this
irish
stout
surprised
me
in
all
regards
the
color
is
pitch
black
with
only
a
thin
amount
of
head
on
top
holding
in
a
slight
coffeenutty
scent
the
taste
is
of
toasted
barley
and
coffee
and
is
balanced
extremely
well
the
carbonation
is
barely
there
in
the
mouth
as
i
like
my
stouts
what
is
truly
great
is
the
drinkability
the
fourth
beer
is
just
as
tasty
as
the
first
what
will
put
this
above
other
stouts
for
me
is
the
price
easily
as
good
as
other
crafts
that
are
4
more
per
six
pack
style
wise
overall
a
decent
effort
from
saranac
ill
give
it
another
shot
but
wont
actively
seek
it
out
drinkability
a
well
balanced
brew
with
no
overpowering
flavours
everything
i
would
expect
of
a
beer
in
this
style
the
medium
to
light
body
and
sheer
silkiness
of
this
beer
lead
to
the
ability
to
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
enjoy
what
saranac
has
done
in
creating
this
generic
but
very
drinkable
well
made
tasty
brew
drinkability
for
a
stout
this
is
very
drinkable
not
as
heavy
as
others
but
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
to
warm
up
with
during
the
winter
overall
a
bit
lightbodied
and
thin
but
tasty
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
bit
light
but
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
easy
to
drink
picked
this
brew
up
for
a
try
new
offering
from
saranac
in
the
past
been
hit
and
miss
with
the
new
releases
so
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
poured
to
nice
black
color
and
if
held
to
a
light
source
you
get
some
dark
ruby
color
has
a
nice
medium
tan
colored
head
quite
creamy
great
legs
and
tons
of
lacing
the
aroma
comes
off
more
roasted
and
toasted
than
burnt
with
a
slight
sweet
scent
lactose
overall
a
excellent
aroma
coming
from
this
one
the
flavor
is
excellent
while
not
complicated
it
has
a
nice
roasted
malts
flavor
very
faint
astringent
note
slight
sweetness
in
the
middle
has
a
similar
profile
probably
from
the
yeast
that
i
get
in
the
other
offering
from
saranac
that
flavor
works
here
in
some
of
the
other
brews
it
does
not
again
this
one
is
not
overly
complicated
but
it
works
extremely
well
for
a
sessional
brew
slight
watery
but
i
feel
the
same
about
most
of
the
major
irish
dry
stouts
now
i
might
be
called
crazy
but
for
me
this
brew
was
just
as
good
as
the
guinness
or
murphys
i
have
had
actually
like
the
consistence
of
this
one
better
maybe
this
is
me
being
a
homer
i
must
say
that
some
of
the
saranac
offerings
have
been
lack
luster
as
of
late
but
this
one
is
very
good
imo
d
i
would
say
i
could
def
drink
this
often
tastes
like
the
typical
irish
stout
plus
with
its
price
you
cant
go
wrong
although
i
feel
that
this
is
better
than
saranacs
mocha
stout
oatmeal
stout
or
vanilla
stout
ive
never
tried
their
traditional
stout
i
would
still
suggest
either
their
imperial
stout
or
black
tan
over
this
saranac
irish
stout
is
a
solid
black
ale
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
toasty
and
malty
aroma
that
seems
a
touch
sweet
its
mediumlight
bodied
a
little
bubbly
dry
and
crisp
with
a
clean
finish
its
a
pretty
mellow
flavor
thats
well
balanced
it
tastes
a
little
roasty
and
the
finish
is
pretty
green
its
a
decent
session
beer
