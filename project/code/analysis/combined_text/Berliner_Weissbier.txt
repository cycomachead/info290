poured
into
my
teku
glass
mouthfeel
is
light
and
pleasant
overall
not
sure
what
to
say
i
have
little
experience
with
the
combination
of
sour
and
smokey
its
definitely
interesting
and
i
would
say
its
well
made
but
it
may
not
be
my
style
this
beer
is
ripe
unique
and
full
of
incredible
flavor
what
a
winner
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
heavy
on
the
smoke
and
wheaty
on
the
finish
id
say
the
tartness
of
a
berliner
weisse
is
absent
here
so
thats
a
bit
of
a
strike
against
it
otherwise
its
an
enjoyable
beer
for
summer
months
o
a
tasty
unique
beer
definitely
will
try
this
again
light
orange
in
color
slightly
hazy
small
head
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
is
wheat
grass
a
slight
sour
citrus
note
flavor
is
tart
yeast
and
smoke
at
first
grains
intertwine
with
the
sourness
very
appealing
a
slight
smoky
saltiness
sits
on
the
tongue
on
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
treat
to
the
taste
buds
lighter
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
up
to
this
point
recommended
to
fans
of
berliners
and
rauchbiers
overall
this
is
a
light
bodied
tangy
weissbier
im
not
rooting
around
for
my
bullhorn
to
let
the
neighborhood
know
about
my
great
find
if
you
stumble
across
it
at
the
packie
and
you
feel
like
trying
something
new
grab
a
bottle
i
just
wouldnt
seek
it
out
over
another
favorite
weiss
or
lager
the
flavor
is
very
interesting
and
has
lots
of
malt
complexity
yet
only
light
sweetness
more
earhty
and
high
smoke
presence
with
aromatics
of
wood
in
the
taste
and
not
charred
or
overly
heavy
like
a
briquette
or
campfire
smokiness
a
very
well
integrated
smoke
in
the
malt
which
has
a
nice
caramel
accent
which
adds
to
the
yeast
flavor
with
tangy
taste
yet
there
is
a
mild
herbal
quality
with
dry
toasty
layers
of
wood
in
the
finish
overall
i
loved
this
i
think
it
is
great
since
it
combineds
some
of
the
elements
of
a
sour
wheat
with
a
smoked
beer
in
a
way
that
enhances
the
blend
with
sourdough
bread
with
smoked
grain
kind
of
complexity
and
it
is
just
excellent
with
lots
of
interesting
and
complex
elements
that
work
well
together
i
recommend
this
overall
i
am
really
impressed
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
not
hugely
smokey
or
aggressively
sour
just
very
even
and
refined
and
full
of
delicate
notes
that
are
plentiful
and
tasty
im
buying
more
of
this
beer
no
questions
asked
one
of
the
most
original
beers
i
have
tasted
in
awhile
the
base
of
a
good
hefe
soured
and
then
smoked
the
sour
notes
balance
the
banana
flavours
of
the
hefe
and
then
the
smoke
comes
through
in
the
finish
and
the
nose
it
all
works
as
the
balance
is
there
and
such
the
drinkability
is
maintained
i
have
never
tasted
a
combination
such
as
this
and
i
applaud
german
brewers
who
step
outside
the
tried
and
true
styles
that
dominate
the
country
worth
adding
to
your
palate
but
there
is
not
enough
smokey
character
though
really
great
all
around
not
nearly
as
much
smoke
presence
as
id
expected
but
far
more
complex
well
balanced
and
very
easy

i

i
would
take
another
stab
at
this
interesting
brew
overall
a
style
i
am
a
little
familiar
with
and
this
beer
is
like
a
rauchbier
and
berliner
weiss
mixed
in
him
delicious
and
interesting
might
not
be
for
some
people
but
i
enjoyed
it
o
the
smoked
malt
is
nice
but
they
need
to
let
the
lacto
do
its
work
here
not
nearly
acidic
enough
quite
sour
flavor
little
wheat
taste
the
body
is
a
bit
watery
in
both
body
and
carbonation
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
cranberry
juice
overall
i
cant
advise
to
try
this
i
even
find
the
smoky
flavor
to
be
distracting
poured

week
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
with

that
dssipates
to
patchy

and
a
ring
around
the
glass
mild
aroma
of
lemon
white

and
slight

faint
smoke
flavor
is
tart
lemon
apple
and
grape
juice
up

very
tart
at
first
but
soon
ameliorated
by
smoky
dry
light
fruit
light
bodied
an
interesting
take
on
the
berliner
style
the
flavor
was
almost
to
tart
at
first
but
does
mellow
in
the
finish
althoug
it
leaves
a
lingering
lactic
tart
and
smoke
aftertaste
flavors
are
tart
but
not
intense
although
tart
beers
are
not
my
style
i
enjoyed
this
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
smoke
presence
although
the
smoke
does
make
this
beer
stand
out
interesting
and
different
o
ive
never
had
a
beer
be
both
sour
and
smokey
so
this
was
a
nice
first
experience
to
the
lichtenhainer
weisse
substyle
im
generally
a
fan
of
both
sours
and
smoked
beers
and
this
delivered
on
both
ends
worth
a
stab
if
youre
into
either
individual
styles
this
is
a
gangly
creation
a
learning
experience
of
sorts
i
found
myself
wishing
for
some
mild
cheese
to
smooth
out
the
sharp
edges
and
make
it
more
drinkable
lacking
this
i
left
some
in
the
glass
absolutely
happy
i
had
the
experience
wouldnt
and
couldnt
drink
a
ton
of
it
on
one
setting
but
would
certainly
have
a
glass
again
must
try
i
like
the
argument
that
lichtenhainer
should
be
its
own
style
as
apparently
it
was
historically
and
not
any
sort
of
berlinerweiss
there
is
no
hint
of
lactobacillus
it
has
just
a
touch
of
the
hefe
spice
but
a
distinct
malty
grainy
flavor
with
some
perfumey
notes
this
is
vastly
more
drinkable
than
any
berliner
ive
had
in
any
case
and
i
say
if
you
see
it
you
ought
to
try
it
from
the
500
ml
bottle
purchased
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
i
dont
know
that
id
get
another
but
damn
strange
one
blown
away
by
this
one
amazing
brew
o
the
nice
wheat
flavor
with
good
smoke
flavor
is
complimented
by
some
funk
tart
hints
every
thing
is
balanced
and
mellow
making
this
interesting
and
very
tasty
and
sessionable
definitely
a
strange
idea
but
it
works
well
here
nice
balance
and
the
flavors
dont
clash
nice
and
refreshing
the
smoke
really
didnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
tartness
like
i
thought
it
would
the
nose
was
muted
and
didnt
amaze
me
clean
flavors
with
a
solid
finish
good
beer
for
food
pairing
o
well
i
didnt
realize
this
this
was
a
smoked
berliner
when
i
ordered
it
and
i
probably
wouldnt
have
tried
it
if
i
did
the
smoke
was
a
surprise
and
diminished
what
was
otherwise
a
tasty
beer
but
i
cant
ding
the
beer
too
much
for
tasting
like
what
its
supposed
to
i
finished
it
without
a
problem
but
wont
be
having
another
a
smoked
german
beer
with
some
tartness
to
it
this
combination
of
flavors
isnt
going
to
cause
a
revolution
but
they
work
out
better
than
i
imagined
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
a

the
beer

very
interesting
take
on
a
berliner
the
lacto

smoke
dominate
the
front
and
back
with
a
nice
bright
fruit
flavor
overall
nice
and
has
some
slightly
weird
things
going
on

a
try

not
likely
to

filtered

gotta
give
it
up
for
the
resurrection
of
sorts
of
a
nearlylost
style
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mildlytart
lemon
zest
light
coriander
light
black
pepper
light
cracked
wheat
and
a
hint
of
beech
smoke
in
the
background
i
may
or
may
not
get
a
hint
of
juniper
in
there
as
well
but
its
hard
to
tell
for
sure
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
that
smoke
is
a
bit
more
intense
now
not
very
much
frankly
its
still
just
a
minor
pall
on
the
absolute
range
but
its
enough
to
effectively
color
the
second
half
of
the
proceedings
here
normally
im
all
for
smoke
like
this
often
even
stronger
but
here
it
begins
as
a
clashing
partner
with
the
lemony
bits
and
then
as
a
silencer
a
deadener
of
the
same
things
just
dont
work
all
that
well
together
on
my
tongue
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
but
one
that
just
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
overall
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
hated
it
i
had
it
again
more
recently
and
actually
really
enjoyed
it
not
sure
if
my
palate
just
changed
or
what
but
this
is
definitely
and
interesting
and
excellent
brew
its
a
great
modern
take
on
a
very
ancient
and
forgotten
style
possibly
the
most
interesting
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
revives
in
a
way
a
forgotten
style
and
in
that
way
its
unique
because
its
so
different
from
almost
all
of
the
other
beers
on
the
market
there
are
hundreds
of
years
of
german
brewing
history
behind
us
and
id
love
to
see
more
of
these
styles
revealed
hedonistically
the
beer
is
also
a
treat
it
offers
both
tartness
and
smokiness
two
fairly
unique
characteristics
these
days
but
at
moderate
very
accessible
levels
its
interesting
and
entertaining
as
well
as
refreshing
and
satiating
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
what
a
tasty
unique
and
refreshing
beer
the
smoke
and
the
tartness
are
both
in
check
without
being
overdone
i
really
expected
this
to
be
more
sour
so
it
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
its
still
a
really
tasty
nicely
balanced
and
refreshing
beer
just
not
very
sour
overall
holy
cow
ive
never
had
a
beer
with
this
much
funk
its
got
a
bit
of
a
its
so
bad
its
good
thing
going
on
at
times
i
want
to
drainpour
but
then
i
keep
going
back
cant
say
id
ever
drink
this
again
but
interesting
to
try
once
interesting
mix
of
smokey
tart
and
fruity
flavors
along
with
a
persistent
grainy
malt
note
certainly
not
brewed
to
style
but
a
solid
beer
none
the
less
opoints
for
uniqueness
it
is
drinkable
though
maybe
not
as
much
as
other
german
sours
i
recommend
anyone
to
try
this
enjoyed
while
attending
cantillon
zwanze
day
2012
at
avenue
pub
as
a
pregame
to
the
event
served
from
tap
into
a
duvel
sampler
poured
a
hazy
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
smoke
sour
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
toasted
malt
smoke
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
this
brew
really
had
quite
a
bit
of
potential
the
aroma
was
about
the
only
letdown
here
as
it
was
rather
weak
i
basically
had
to
bury
my
nose
into
the
beer
to
pick
up
on
anything
while
this
was
a
little
bit
of
a
buzzkill
the
flavor
did
recover
from
this
the
toastiness
actually
went
decently
with
the
sour
note
i
picked
up
on
the
smokiness
just
took
it
to
another
level
on
top
of
that
a
really
well
done
brew
that
i
would
definitely
take
the
time
to
explore
again
bottle
poured
a
light
hazy
pale
yellow
color
weisse
with
a
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
lactic
sour
notes
with
light
subtle
smoky
flavour
are
quite
interesting
taste
is
a
good
mix
between
some
lactic
sour
notes
with
some
subtle
smoky
notes
which
are
really
not
overpowering
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
well
brewed
with
nice
light
touch
of
wheat
notes
so
at
the
end
this
revieuw
is
not
for
people
who
like
rauchbeers
i
just
didnt
aroma
and
flavor
go
hand
in
hand
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
with
the
lemony
tartness
and
smoke
which
is
certainly
present
but
not
overbearing
wheat
spice
pepper
funk
all
play
a
lesser
subtler
role
a
sour
rauchbier
that
stops
short
of
the
full
smoked
sausage
effect
but
should
appeal
to
fans
of
both
styles
really
unique
and
fun
i
quite
enjoyed
this
definitely
memorable
o
german
craft
beer
thats
right
german
craft
beer
certainly
not
in
line
with
tradition
but
this
one
escaped
that
rule
for
a
pretty
good
reason
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
combination
of
the
smokey
flavors
and
smells
with
the
tartness
of
the
berliner
weissbeir
is
quite
complementary
the
smokey
flavors
do
not
overpower
as
i
had
feared
they
might
easy
to
drink
even
though
this
is
an
imperial
berliner
weissbier
and
the
alcohol
is
still
well
hidden
i
would
definitely
try
another
of
these
this
is
unique
like
no
other
so
bonus
points
there
it
is
a
smoked
berliner
weiss
which
as
far
as
i
know
hasnt
been
done
too
commonly
it
pours
hazy
light
brown
without
much
head
a
little
watery
and
kind
of
yellow
to
weird
the
nose
is
rauchbier
smokey
intense
in
that
way
over
the
lemon
peel
acidic
bitterness
of
a
normal
berliner
weiss
an
odd
fusion
of
styles
for
certain
the
flavor
is
overly
smoked
dominates
the
subtle
fruit
notes
acid
and
smoke
are
also
strange
bedfellows
and
im
not
sure
it
works
feel
works
though
maybe
a
little
thin
on
body
even
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
isnt
as
bright
as
id
like
it
to
be
i
appreciate
the
attempt
here
but
it
didnt
exactly
click
in
my
opinion
the
smokey
citrus
tart
beer
is
an
odd
blend
worth
a
try
though
i
suppose
because
there
is
nothing
else
like
it
out
there
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
even
though
its
an
imperial
berliner
weissbier
coming
in
at
6
abv
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
present
in
the
taste
i
think
that
the
smoke
was
very
well
incorporated
into
this
beer
because
its
not
overpowering
and
you
can
still
taste
the
sourness
and
other
flavors
in
this
beer

d
well
rounded
tasty
brew
this
is
an
instance
in
which
combining
two
things
i
like
if
a
huge
success
pretty
mild
on
the
tartness
and
slightly
acidic
on
the
back
of
the
tounge
the
taste
seems
to
fade
out
towards
the
end
light
bodied
and
boldly
carbed
up
if
it
tasted
better
and
the
abv
was
lowered
a
bit
this
would
make
it
easy
for
a
few
maybe
the
addition
of
peatsmoke
ingredients
is
what
upped
the
alc
on
a
session
type
beer
very
enjoyable
if
you
are
adventurous
different
complex
and
balanced
love
that
after
all
of
the
pieces
you
get
wheat
at
the
end
worth
trying
fuller
bodied
than
expected
but
even
more
one
dimensional
than
the
nose
suggests
only
sligtly
sour
with
an
overwhelming
lactic
funk
presence
very
funk
and
cheesy
with
an
unpleasant
dairy
flavor
that
overpowers
the
mustiness
light
fruit
and
other
notes
again
im
not
picking
up
any
smokiness
wheat
or
citrus
just
all
lactic
funk
o
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
including
the
smoke
element
in
a
wheat
beer
just
adds
to
the
autumn
appeal
ill
have
this
again
its
always
nice
to
come
across
a
beer
that
is
interesting
unique
and
good
plus
for
the
odd
flavor
combination
its
actually
quite
easy
to
drink
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
2
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
foamy
rings
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
wheat
and
smoke
aromas
taste
is
actually
pretty
sour
with
a
nice
balance
between
wheatgrain
flavors
and
smoke
flavors
up
front
there
are
some
flavors
of
banana
and
spices
on
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
really
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
very
interesting
beer
to
try
a
unique
take
on
the
style
for
sure
id
a
like
a
bigger
sour
kick
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
bit
of
a
surprise
to
come
across
b
t
opens
with
a
nice
tartness
of
lemon
and
granny
smith
apples
leaves
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
maybe
a
hint
of
white
nectarine
and
grapefruit
finishes
tart
with
just
a
hint
of
smokiness
on
the
way
out
feels
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
but
a
really
good
beer
nonetheless
its
all
there
the
smoke
banana
clove
sourness
bubblegum
apple
all
creating
a
ton
of
complexities
for
such
a
refreshing
beer
2nd
glass
different
keg
seemed
a
bit
less
funky
and
the
tartness
was
in
the
background
compared
to
the
mild
smoked
grain
character
d
i
had
multiple
pours
and
i
found
this
pretty
easy
to
quaff
even
at
6
would
really
like
to
try
the
original
version
as
i
can
imagine
itd
be
even
more
drinkable
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
very
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
everything
about
this
brew
is
bigger
than
the
abraxas
the
carbonation
the
residual
malt
inclusion
the
alcohol
etc
the
smoke
and
tartness
are
just
as
evident
as
the
other
version
but
this
one
just
seems
to
be
a
bit
better
blended
the
smoke
transitions
to
tart
a
bit
better
with
the
more
solid
grain
inclusion
that
is
here
for
6
though
the
alcohol
is
still
masked
pretty
well
i
enjoyed
both
of
these
very
much
and
for
different
reasons
if
i
had
to
pick
one
and
only
one
though
i
would
choose
the
abraxas
over
abraxxxas
d
the
imperial
version
here
is
way
more
interesting
but
perhaps
less
easily
enjoyed
than
the
regular
more
straightforward
incarnation
d
and
overall
impression
not
something
i
would
have
again
overall
the
smoke
does
not
work
with
this
beer
regular
abraxus
blows
this
out
of
the
water
skal
in
short
a
smokeveil
dressed
berliener
weisse
and
one
of
the
the
most
refreshing
brews
youll
ever
come
across
a
very
interesting
berliner
weissesour
ale
hybrid
the
aroma
is
that
of
funk
fruit
and
grass
very
complex
reminiscent
of
a
dewy
field
there
is
a
major
shock
upon
taking
the
first
sip
as
the
taste
and
smell
differ
vastly
the
taste
has
a
strong
berliner
muskiness
upfront
and
a
thin
lactic
finish
hints
of
smoke
and
dryness
in
the
mouthfeel
very
curious
brew
would
love
another
go
at
this
i
found
the
beer
interesting
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
perhaps
not
as
good
as
the
cerise
theres
a
touch
too
much
seed
and
bitter
pit
presence
in
this
one
still
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
displays
the
qualities
of
the
fruit
perfectly

in
this

notes
ruby

pink
frothy

good

that
doesnt
carry
into
the
flavor
which
displays
a
clean
sharp
sourness
dry
no
bitterness
needed
for
fans
of
sour
beers
this
one

are
my

fruit
so
i
may
be
biased
exit
stage

the
light
bodied
ale
lifts
from
the
tongue
and
evaporates
in
an
instance
allowing
for
a
highly
clean
refreshing
and
palatestripping
taste
with
virtually
no

it
was
going

tart
wheaty
sour

all
in
admirable
balance
easy
to

that
is
if
you
dont
mind
the
strippeddown
nature
of
the
titular
fruit
each
sip
daring
you
to
immediately
have
another
go
oone
of
my
most
soughtafter
beers
at
the
festival
actually
one
of
my
more
sought
after
beers
raspberry
berliner
weiss
oh
yes
an
absolute
stunner
exceeded
rather
high
expectations
o
this
is
a
fruit
beer
i
can
get
along
with
not
that
overly
chemically
artificial
mess
that
fruit
beers
usually
end
up
as
recommend
to
someone
who
believes
fruit
beers
are
a
boring
style
as
i
once
did
o
awesome
berliner
sour
great
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
got
as
an
extra
from
franklinn
nice
moderately
high
carbonation
o
would
love
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
really
awesome
lambic
style
berliner
od
guess
what
this
is
a
sour
wheat
beer
brewed
with
raspberries
just
like
the
bottle
says
this
was
pretty
decent
cant
say
it
was
worthy
of
the
hype
and
my
expectations
but
not
too
shabby
at
all
and
seemingly
well
put
together
one
and
done
for
me
though
overall
this
would
be
really
great
if
not
for
that
weird
flavor
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
great
flavors
and
aromas
o
fantastic
beer
from
the
nose
to
the
start
and
through
the
finish
this
is
full
tribute
to
raspberries
the
taste
is
again
raspberries
tart
but
unfortunately
slightly
one
dimensional
tart
and
very
light
o
awesome
its
out
of
control
raspberry
i
would
imagine
that
this
beer
is
best
served
fresh
and
i
am
a
massive
fan
bonkers
this
is
too
much
raspberry
said
no
one
ever
o
a
bright
and
tangy
brew
true
to
the
flavour
of
raspberries
light
and
dry
like
a
palette
cleanser
it
offers
a
tangy
and
refreshing
drink
to
liven
the
palette
thankfully
void
of
the
artificially
sugary
cough
drops
profile
while
delivering
of
a
full
sophisticated
scent
and
flavor
simply
delicious
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
dry
crisp
clean
refreshing
and
downright
impressive
i
could
drink
this
by
the
quart
if
given
the
opportunity
an
awesome
representation
of
the
style
very
impressive
how
much
raspberry
character
is
present
without
any
sweetness
for
being
at
least
a
year
or
2
old
bottle
thank
you
very
much
heath
for
sharing
overall
very
nice
doesnt
taste
a
lot
like
a
berliner
to
me
but
i
like
it
o
not
really
familiar
with
berliner
weissbiers
but
judging
by
the
style
description
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
flavoured
variety
where
the
colour
and
smell
really
show
off
the
beer
but
the
berry
flavour
then
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
sour
wheat
beer
characteristics
a
perfect
summer
sipper
not
too
sour
but
enough
so
to
be
refreshing
and
as
with
all
ddc
very
well
made
not
a
beer
youre
expecting
when
you
crack
the
bottle
but
leaves
you
wishing
you
got
more
than
just
1
four
pack
for
the
entire
summer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
big
thanks
goes
out
to
oldp0rt
for
sending
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
semirecent
trade
shared
this
one
on
the
one
year
anniversary
of
my
accidentsurgery
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
half
finger
pink
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
fruit
funk
earth
and
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
strawberry
funk
subtle
earth
tart
and
sour
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
if
i
am
honest
i
have
to
say
that
this
was
one
of
the
best
berliners
that
ive
had
todate
the
raspberry
boomed
through
on
each
sip
and
kept
me
begging
for
more
the
tart
and
sour
aspect
worked
really
well
with
the
fruity
sweetness
this
made
for
a
unique
and
downright
tasty
combination
if
i
am
honest
a
really
well
done
brew
that
im
glad
i
got
to
experience
overall
just
a
fantasic
beer
i
could
drink
this
every
week
and
probably
never
get
tired
of
it
lived
up
to
my
expectation
and
then
some
so
glad
that
i
have
a
couple
more
to
savour
of
a
style
i
dont
get
nearly
enough
of
bottle
poured
a
light
pinkish
color
beer
with
a
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
tart
raspberries
with
some
light
brett
notes
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
tart
notes
with
fresh
raspberries
and
light
residual
sugar
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
well
brewed
with
right
mix
between
fresh

and
funky
notes
i
wish
this
would
be
available
on
a
more
regular
basis
cost

i

i
had
a

of
in

another
excellent
beer
from
ddc
overall
not
sure
if
i
had
a
bad
bottle
the
but
smell
was
really
offputting
with
this
beer
im
all
for
funky
scents
in
beer
but
this
one
smelled
like
burnt
rubber
or
at
least
burnt
raspberries
thankfully
it
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
o
surprise
beer
of
the
night
i
had
no
clue
what
this
was
before
i
tasted
it
and
was
completely
blown
away
i
want
more
now
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
berliner
do
it
recommend
note
one
of
the
two
bottles
i
opened
had
a
diacetylesque
note
to
it
so
there
appears
to
be
some
bottle
variation
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
but
mileage
may
vary

it

the
opportunity
overall
i
like

beers
i
love
being

by
new
beers
this
beer
is
no
exception
when
luk
gave
it
to
me
as
an
extra
i
decided
to
hold
off
for
a
bit
to
try
it
knowing
i
would
probably
enjoy
it
i
am
very
happy
i
was
not
let
down
i
can
only
hope
this
beings
to
be
imported
to
the
united
states
i
believe
it
is
only
available
in
canada
as
of
now
if
so
i
would
buy
as
much
of
this
as
i
could
fantastic
couldnt

this
beer
pours
a
super
vibrant
red
with
shades

and
appears
more
red
than
gambrinus
or
any
other
beer
with
raspberries
that
ive
seen
the
smell
and
taste
are
the

in
terms
of
fruit
foward
raspberries
as
it
almost
seems
youre
drinking
carbonated

there
is
some

well

the

refreshing

combined
with
the
perfectly
ripened
raspberry
flavor
i
dont
normally
like
to
compare
within
a
review
but
this
beer
is
basically
what
i
had
expected
bottleworks
xii
to
be
instead
it
is
simple
but
simply
delicious
overall
one
of
my
favorite
ddc
beers
raspberries
are
my
favorite
fruit
and
this
beer
really
lets
them
shine
while
certainly
tart
it
still
is
a
worldclass
brew
and
is
worth
driving
2
hours
round
trip
to
the
brewery
to
get
good
stuff
brilliant
red
body
with
a
pinkish
thin
head
huge
raspberry
nose
it
smells
exactly
like
real
raspberries
taste
is
killer
perfect
raspberries
right
up
front
and
super
strong
again
real
pure
raspberry
taste
very
tart
and
delicious
thin
bodied
phenomenal
drinkability
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
wound
up
ordering
a
second
i
really
enjoy
the
dieu
du
ciel
beers
and
tried
many
others
this
past
weekend
this
one
was
far
and
away
my
favorite
this
is
a
refreshing
and
sour
a
step
from
what
i
would
call
a
framboiseits
delightful
taste
whoh
this
stuff
is
tangtastic
lipsmacking
like
pure
unsweetened
cranberry
juice
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
i
seriously
believe
that
its
impossible
to
make
a
beer
more
refreshing
than
this
light
wheaty
body
and
a
dry
mead
aftertaste
this
stuff
is
kick
ass
it
is
quite
an
experience
to
try
im
thinking
of
making
the
drive
from
so
nh
to
montreal
just
to
have
this
brew
this
is
an
interpretation
of
the
berliner
weisse
style
done
avec
fruit
strawberry
raspberry
or
blueberry
with
this
lovely
example
being
enhanced
by
the
raspberry
strikingly
beautiful
rose
red
color
with
pinkish
head
tart
can
i
hear
ya
say
hell
ya
freshly
picked
raspberries
run
bonedry
through
the
finish
this
isnt
for
the
faint
of
heart
a
definate
nono
for
nonba
women
drinkers
looking
for
one
of
them
funkyass
sweet
fruit
brews
i
hope
that
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
and
may
try
again
someday
as
i
am
generally
a
fan
of
this
flavor
profile
this
beer
was
falsely
advertised
as
an
intensely
sour
wild
ale
but
the
beer
isnt
sour
at
all
i
mean
not
one
bit
of
tart
was
tasted
the
pour
is
nice
without
foam
and
the
beer
is
still
a
smooth
one
if
youre
looking
for
a
sour
skip
this
brew
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
day
time
or
summer
beer
then
this
one
is
a
go
tastes
like
the
after
taste
of
a
war
head
very
bitter
easy
drink
low
alc
level
no
complaints
but
not
blown
away
either
45
is
a
fair
assessment
almost
tastes
like
champagne
if
i
want
to
continue
my
night
cant
go
for
9
so
its
a
very
solid
option
at
one
mile
house
a
really
wonderful
berliner
weisse
murky

not
much

smell
yeast

lemon

serving
type
bottle
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
fairly
refreshing
with
an
interesting
funk
inclusion
of
brett
this
was
a
good
beer
it
just
misses
the
berliner
style
a
little
with
its
focus
on
funk
for
an
american
wild
its
solid
for
a
berliner
i
was
happy
with
just
one
pour
overall
a
nice
beer
great
for
summer
corked
and
caged
750ml
poured
into
a
tulip
surprisingly
clear
with
just
a
slight
haze
to
the
straw
gold
body
mild
carbonation
produces
a
thin
mat
of
white
head
subtle
and
soft
lactic
sourness
hits
the
nose
and
palate
first
lemon
juice
grass
and
a
background
note
of
earth
and
herb
from
the
lemon
verbena
a
smooth
vein
of
musky
funk
runs
through
the
beer
and
adds
a
nice
complexity
another
wave
of
tartness
hits
the
back
of
the
palate
on
the
swallow
really
nice
and
refreshing
but
still
plenty
complex
certainly
inspired
by
berliner
weiss
but
this
beer
brings
a
little
something
else
well
done
o
more
of
a
wild
than
i
expected
and
would
certainly
encourage
fans
of
the
wild
ales
to
give
this
one
a
try
i
would
love
to
have
more
access
to
it
and
will
be
picking
up
a
case
for
the
summer
next
chance
i
get
this
is
a
formidable
beer
but
with
some
complexity
overall
a
joy
to
drink
as
the
daytime
highs
have
jumped
from
40s50s
one
day
to
over
80
degrees
the
next
this
was
just
the
refreshing
easytodrink
tipple
i
needed
b
o
overall
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
and
it
doesnt
look
great
but
the
nose
and
taste
are
very
good
would
certainly
have
it
again
overall
an
outstanding
summer
beer
to
beat
the
heat
citrus
refreshment
and
not
much
else
more
more
tart
than
sour
and
not
as
complex
but
enjoyable
non
the
less
o
a
very
well
balanced
brew
definitely
one
worth
revisiting
this
was
my
first
ever
sour
beer
at
least
that
was
what
id
call
it
it
has
its
moments
but
im
sure
others
must
be
better
maybe
ill
go
back
to
this
after
i
try
a
few
others
ahhhh
i
love
this
style

i
really

love
the
idea
of

i
think
the
lactic
notes
of
a
berliner
weiss
work
very
well
i
think
this
works
quite
well
it
retains
the
refreshing
nature
of
a
wheat
beer
but
adds
some
funky

55despite
the
style
its
under
per
ba
but
it
is
not
a
creamy
wheat
taste
from
a
normal
wheat
ale
that
part
disapointed
my
drinking
buddy
i
got
some
brett
and
its
just
a
hunch
tart
doughy
malt
to
give
off
a
lemon
pastry
impression
bready
with
some
light
spice
as
well
medium
bodied
with
some
spritzy
bubbles
while
this
isnt
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
interesting
beverage
nonetheless

of
this
one
i
hope
that
people
try
this
beer
and
realize
that
its
a
style
that
has
the
potential
for
returning
to
popularity

took
a

to

one

crispy
beer
overall
an
ok
berliner

and
easy
to
acquire
great
for
a
simple
warm
day
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
if
you
can
handle
the
sourness
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
a
dash
of
raspberry
or
woodruff
would
definitely
make
it
more
palatable
nonetheless
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
tasty
though
surprisingly
sharp
i
suspect
the
acidity
has
increased
while
it
was
sat
in
my
garage
the
flavour
is
most
reminiscent
of
unsweetened
yoghurt
with
a
tartness
similar
to
grapefruit
juice
earthy
yeast
dominates
with
subtle
grain
and
wheat
taking
a
back
seat
light
but
refreshing
and
would
certainly
be
nice
on
a
warm
day
its
a
simple
beer
and
i
find
it
very
drinkable
preferably
without
the
syrup
that
the
germans
insist
on
adding
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
a
very
sour
tasting
beer
with
citrus
and
some
wheat
but
other
than
that
there
isnt
a
lot
to
report
on
this
one
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
after
the
initial
acidity
and
sourness
settled
down
slightly
i
felt
like
taking
an
effervescent
c
vitamin
interesting
but
didnt
fell
like
asking
another
one
though
not
knowing
what
i
was
drinking
ahead
didnt
help
overall
i
have
only
had
a
few
of
this
style
so
i
am
no
expert
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
thirst
quencher
would
be
outstanding
on
a
hot
afternoon
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this

that
gradually

a
broken
slick

is
bready
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
follows
nose
however
a
bit
more
citrus
forward
in
the
flavor
profile
tartness
is
present
but
a
little
masked
by
the
other
qualities
there
is
also
a
residual
yeasty
character
at
the
finish
that
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
pleasant
citrus
astringency
and
an
assertive
carbonation
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
however
perhaps
a
little
too
bready
flavor
for
my
general
sensibilities
overall
a
good
beer
bit
too
sour
for
me
to
drink
alot
of
though
overall
a
classic
and
interesting
alternative
the
the
average
beer
drinkers
beer
it
has
the
low
alcohol
that
makes
this
an
easydrinking
beer
but
has
the
complexity
from
the
sourness
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
nicely
blended
lambic
i
am
impressed
dr
too
strange
even
for
the
style
o
my
first
berliner
weisse
i
can
see
why
this
isnt
considered
a
great
one
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
and
it
definitely
gives
me
the
urge
to
try
more
good
sourness
but
just
a
little
weak
on
the
edges
worth
picking
up
if
you
stumble
across
it
o
i
dig
this
beer
every
time
i
have
it
4
this
is
a
light
bodied
offering
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
perhaps
just
a
touch
less
carbonation
than
most
other
takes
on
the
style
but
still
well
done
this
brew
is
very
clean
and
excessively
drinkable
with
a
crisp
finish
i
pounded
down
nearly
half
my
glass
before
even
starting
to
think
about
what
i
was
doing
if
this
brew
was
readily
available
to
me
i
would
purchase
this
nonstop
throughout
the
summertime
o
this
is
pretty
much
a
standard
of
the
style
but
certainly
not
the
best
out
there
this
beer
was
really
not
what
i
expected
a
whopping
3
abv
i
suppose
that
since
the
word
kindl
is
in
name
of
the
beer
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
lighter
brew
for
the
younger
folks
in
germany
this
beer
is
the
proper
color
for
the
style
its
a
lightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
flavor
had
a
bit
of
a
tartness
to
it
perhaps
lemon
either
way
this
beer
was
a
little
too
light
for
me
and
not
that
good
despite
its
imperfections
this
berliner
weisse
is
growing
on
me
its
very
refreshing
simple
and
really
easy
to
drink
if
one
is
accustomed
to
sour
beer
berliner
kindl
is
also
one
of
the
classics
for
the
style
o
different
and
interesting
but
disappointing
its
just
basically
too
sour
i
could
just
suck
on
a
lemon
drinkability
ok
it
is
refreshing
but
it
does
not
make
me
feel
wanting
for
more
my
opinion
may
change
if
i
had
this
in
30c
weather
now
its
15c
nose
of
wheat
more
or
less
light
for
a
beer
of
this
type
and
a
smell
of
fresh
earth
mouth
full
with
an
amazing
return
suret
and
acid
with
a
touch
of
lactic
acid
very
surprising
not
to
mention
the
key
wheat
however
slight
to
recall
that
this
is
a
weizenbier
while
the
course
is
light
but
has
a
very
good
performance
of
mouth
plus
a
fruity
and
makes
this
very
special
brew
d
this
is
no
favourite
of
mine
to
acidic
for
my
taste
a
good
summer
quencher
to
my
tastes
but
you
have
to
know
what
youre
getting
into
the
sour
taste
can
be
overpowering
at
times
but
i
did
drink
this
much
faster
than
i
thought
i
would
and
really
enjoyed
it
notes
i
had
it
without
any
syrup
and
enjoyed
it
not
something
i
would
necessarily
want
everyday
but
i
could
see
wanting
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
is
extremly
light
both
in
alcohol
and
body
but
really
packs
quite
a
flavorful
sour
punch
the
main
critic
point
is
that
the
sourness
is
enjoyable
and
i
find
the
flavor
intruging
but
seems
a
bit
one
note
i
would
like
a
bit
more
complexity
from
the
tartnessbut
that
being
said
a
very
traditional
style
made
to
be
enjoyed
without
too
much
debate
over
the
subtle
complexities
very
refreshing
i
wasnt
sure
i
would
like
this
style
but
now
im
intrigued
to
try
more
theres
something
incredibly
refreshing
about
this
berliner
weiss
and
the
sourness
brings
up
fond
memories
of
lambics
im
not
sure
how
this
beer
compares
to
the
rest
of
the
style
but
it
gets
a
thumbs
up
from
me
its
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
does
have
its
charms
not
my
type
of
beer
but
does
have
some
positives
most
notability
the
subtle
floral
taste
which
unfortunately
to
a
certain
extent
is
masked
not
what
i
was
expecting
maybe
my
own
ignorance
i
thought
i
was
going
to
get
a
wheat
beer
but
its
really
more
of
a
sour
than
anything
else
its
typically
served
with
soda
or
fruit
infusion
but
i
got
it
plain
it
would
have
been
better
if
thats
what
i
was
looking
for
not
great
with
food
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
especially
the
refreshment
it
provided
on
a
hot
june
day
in
the
middle
of
berlin
d
low
abv
so
you
can
drink
all
day
but
the
flavor
is
only
moderatlty
good
and
would
get
boring
after
a
few
this
beer
is
not
like
its
traditional
bavarian
counter
parts
it
has
a
very
pale
yellow
colored
body
with
lots
of
bubbles
to
support
its
white
head
the
taste
and
smell
are
both
sweet
but
more
tart
the
aroma
is
a
little
earthy
and
citric
it
still
has
a
wheat
like
taste
but
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
a
sour
and
sort
of
like
a
wit
it
has
a
very
fruity
taste
im
not
quite
sure
what
fruit
to
compare
it
to
well
just
leave
it
at
fruity
the
body
is
thin
and
easy
to
drink
there
arent
many
berliner
weiss
beers
out
there
but
i
really
enjoy
the
ones
i
have
sampled
thanks
to
bill
for
knocking
another
of
the
list
for
me
appreciated
bill
thanks
again
this
is
definitely
different
from
anything
ive
had
up
until
now
and
being
one
who
likes
tartsour
brews
this
one
satisfied
me
and
is
very
drinkable
the
label
says
made
with
water
gerstenmalz
weizenmalz
hop
extract
and
wheat
i
wont
argue
with
that
md
superlight
bodied
the
hyper
carbonation
doesnt
help
a
lot
but
the
overall
clean
palate
is
certainly
welcomed
all
in
all
a
brand
new
drinking
experience
for
me
this
is
and
really
gets
me
closer
to
the
picture
of
wheat
beer
mixed
with
a
young
lambic
or
something
totally
more
weird
than
this
the
german
girl
looked
at
me
funny
for
drinking
it
plain
but
it
aint
bad
really
good
summer
drink
ill
have
to
try
it
with
the
syrups
overall
not
bad
i
like
it
for
sure
and
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
all
in
all
i
dont
really
feel
qualified
to
review
this
as
i
dont
think
i
know
enough
about
the
style
to
form
an
intelligent
opinion
i
like
it
kind
of
but
it
doesnt
really
conform
to
my
personal
expectations
of
beer
i
cant
say
id
drink
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
the
tartness
will
give
one
a
bad
stomach
ache
as
i
have
one
coming
on
now
for
a
3

abv
brew
this
is
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
mass
quantities
of
tastes
bitter
and
weak
sort
of
like
quinine
mixed
in
with
some
malt
and
a
lot
of
water
i
believe
this
is
appropriate
for
the
style
but
i
really
just
dont
get
it
has
a
mouthfeel
like
tap
water
i
think
this
is
headed
for
the
drain
i
cant
really
get
more
than
a
couple
sips
in
the
tiny
bottle
is
so
cute
hey
i
got
jipped
here
oh
well
pours
a
cloudy
gold
sunshine
color
with
a
weak
head
smells
of
green
apple
and
fruity
taste
is
acrid
acidic
with
lots
of
carbonation
with
some
fruitiness
mostly
sour
apples
and
a
hint
of
raspberry
syrup
takes
some
getting
used
to
and
not
expected
from
a
weissbier
but
maybe
the
berliner
style
has
something
to
do
with
it
isnt
that
a
jelly
doughnut
what
jfk
so
humorously
admitted
to
being
to
taste
again

d
this
is
really
a
desert
beer
the
sweetness
of
the
syrup
really
would
put
you
off
any
food
had
this
without
the
syrup
before
but
not
reviewed
will
need
to
do
this
however
if
i
had
to
choose
which
syrup
i
would
choose
the
waldmeister
over
himbeere
himbeere
is
too
sweet
d
very
good
extremely
low
in
alcohol
makes
this
a
good
summer
refresher
and
one
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
d
i
will
crave
this
terrific
little
beer
extremely
drinkable
its
evocative
of
the
belgian
gueuze
style
which
i
really
like
in
its
crisp
tartness
though
lighter
in
the
mouth
and
more
approachable
i
read
in
michael
jacksons
great
beer
guide
that
napoleons
troops
dubbed
this
beer
the
champagne
of
the
north
i
can
see
the
similarities
though
at
just
2
5
abv
this
wont
go
straight
to
your
head
like
champagne
at
least
i
hope
not
highly
recommended
drinkability
very
high
if
you
like
sourtart
beers
taste
has
the
tart
snappy
crispness
from
the
bacteria
present
with
a
bready
overtone
cant
really
pick
out
any
hops
syrup
adds
a
raspberry
seed
fruitiness
and
compliments
the
drink
well
suprisingly
good
carbonation
tart
but
not
especially
dry
on
the
palate
one
is
good
it
seems
like
more
of
a
dessert
beer
bartender
relayed
the
tale
that
this
was
originally
developed
as
a
lowalcohol
beer
for
children
in
germany
overall
impression
definitely
an
interesting
beer
pretty
expensive
but
i
was
happy
to
get
the
opportunity
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
first
trial
this
is
only
the
second
berliner
weisse
ive
had
but
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
enjoyed
the
first
too
but
i
am
a
big
fan
of
sour
so
i
might
be
slightly
upwardly
biased
toward
this
beer
the
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
very
little
head
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
in
the
aroma
but
what
little
there
was
faintly
fruity
with
just
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
though
was
entirely
different
there
was
a
great
light
fruitiness
just
a
little
wheat
and
lots
of
sour
the
best
part
was
that
no
matter
how
long
you
held
the
beer
in
your
mouth
the
sour
flavor
seemed
to
stick
around
the
finish
leaves
a
sourness
in
the
bottom
of
your
jaw
that
makes
you
salivate
very
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
beer
and
ill
continue
to
look
for
other
berliner
weisse
brews
up
to
this
point
i
thought
that
only
american
berliner
weisses
were
sour
and
that
european
beers
of
this
style
were
somehow
more
traditional
and
boring
this
beer
has
provided
me
a
central
point
of
what
the
real
deal
is
like
for
this
style
11
1
oz
bottle
color
of
clear
yellow
with
a
frothy
head
nose
of
white
wine
vinegar
straw
hay
and
eggish
thing
going
on

taste
of
brine
hay
dry
straw
and
red
wine
vinegar
body
light
medium
carbonation
and
acidic

aftertaste
of
vinegar
and
acidic
notes
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
others
within
this
style
i
think
ill
steer
clear
a
tart
tasting
light
beer
is
what
it
tasted
like
and
it
really
just
doesnt
fit
well
together
i
would
probably
prefer
this
with
the
syrup
and
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
some
i
would
try
this
again
for
now
straight
up
pass
less
character
than
i
expected
but
possibly
more
drinkable
as
a
result
unfortunately
disappointing
for
the
most
famous
berliner
weiss
but
ill
try
it
sometime
fresh
in
berlin
had
this
at
zekes
in
dowagiac
served
in
a
weiss
glass
with
raspberry
syrup
in
a
small
shot
glass
on
the
side
looked
golden
and
slightly
flat
with
a
fleeting
white
head
after
the
syrup
went
in
it
looked
like
kool
aid
odor
was
sweet
and
had
a
slight
sour
wheatiness
syrup
added
a
raspberry
odor
unremarkably
taste
without
syrup
was
sour
and
fizzy
and
tartly
wheaty
syrup
added
a
slight
fruitiness
and
toned
down
the
tartness
but
otherwise
didnt
change
much
bubbly
mouthfeel
altogether
it
was
a
nice
drink
id
even
have
it
again
if
i
saw
it
and
knew
it
was
fresh
curious
to
try
it
in
berlin
now
d
delicious
a
definite
summer
refresher
which
my
wife
and
i
enjoyed
on
a
mild
winters
day
for
what
it
is
though
this
is
as
good
an
example
to
be
found
pours
pale
straw
colour
with
a
slight
cloudiness
it
is
in
fact
bottleconditioned
with
a
modest
sediment
the
bubbly
head
soon
declines
to
minor
lace
hinting
of
its
claim
as
the
champagne
of
the
north
the
aroma
is
sour
slightly
candyish
and
bready
also
suggesting
this
claim
tart
but
smooth
honeyish
undertones
and
slightly
woody
and
vegetal
the
result
of
a
complex
fermentation
involving
both
topfermenting
and
lactic
strains
of
yeast
no
hops
detected
although
hop
extract
is
used
in
moderation
a
most
enjoyable
finish
that
is
lengthy
and
complex
theres
a
crisp
green
apple
quality
with
tastes
of
yeastand
bonedry
white
wine
the
tartness
persists
throughout
but
is
always
softened
by
underlying
honeyed
tones
a
refreshing
taste
of
brewing
history
and
well
worth
the
search
further
notes
i
made
a
red
raspberry
syrup
for
this
beer
i
added
just
a
bit
about
a
tablespoon
to
the
glass
first
then
poured
the
beer
into
it
it
was
a
spectacular
red
with
a
huge
pink
foamy
head
that
never
went
away
the
sweetness
balanced
the
tartness
a
bit
but
not
completely
and
the
raspberries
contributed
only
mere
hints
of
their
flavor
i
definitely
like
it
better
by
itself
but
its
worth
giving
a
raspberry
syrup
a
try
note
drank
a
lot
of
himbeerweiss
before
i
reached
the
age
of
majority
may
be
predisposed
towards
thinking
this
beer
is
awesome
this
beer
was
my
2nd
at
the
brick
store
in
atlanta
and
i
picked
it
mainly
for
the
low
abv
since
i
had
a
fairly
strong
beer
earlier
they
served
it
in
the
bottle
with
a
wide
mouth
glass
containing
a
shot
of
raspberry
juice
i
poured
the
beer
and
evaluated
it
without
the
raspberry
a
definite
green
apple
tartness
was
evident
it
was
very
crisp
with
good
carbonation
i
added
the
shot
of
juice
to
it
and
the
character
changed
dramatically
the
tartness
of
the
beer
balanced
very
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
raspberry
juice
this
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
served
this
way
without
the
shot
the
beer
was
good
but
my
tastes
dont
tend
too
much
toward
the
tartness
that
this
beer
displayed
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
in
mass
quantities
mouthfeeldrinkability
crackly
and
swift
the
mouthfeel
here
is
very
much
alive
yet
the
soft
fruity
palate
eases
its
effects
and
it
feels
totally
appropriate
when
i
read
the
abv
was
2
5
i
was
amazed
to
find
a
beer
this
low
in
strength
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
in
the
way
of
character
however
this
is
delicious
and
quenching
with
effortless
drinkability
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
this
is
probably
not
a
beer
i
will
have
again
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
very
good
if
you
are
a
cider
drinker
and
looking
for
an
introduction
into
good
beer
this
would
be
a
great
starting
point
i
can
imagine
that
this
can
be
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summernight
but
for
me
it
is
just
a
bit
too
acidic
and
empty
cheers
the
himbeer
gave
it
a
smoothness
and
sweet
raspberry
fruitness
and
added
some
complexity
to
it
prost
beertracker
i
like
this
beer
more
each
sip
its
not
great
but
its
good
and
very
light
this
would
make
a
wonderful
summer
lawnmower
brew
berliner
kindl
weisse
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
33cl
bottle
lactic
acid
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
well
now
thats
completely
different
from
any
beer
ive
tried
quite
sour
but
not
in
an
offensive
way
not
something
id
drink
often
but
quite
interesting
definitely
worth
a
try
your
mileage
may
vary
on
this
one
edit
after
looking
around
the
apartment
for
a
while
i
found
some
fruit
punch
and
added
about
two
shots
worth
into
my
mostly
full
glass
im
quite
impressed
how
well
this
little
amount
of
sweet
juice
woke
up
this
beer
despite
the
addition
of
the
fruit
flavors
this
really
allows
the
yeast
and
wheat
flavors
to
come
through
since
the
tartness
has
disappeared
much
improved
with
the
little
addition
of
sugar
a
fantastic
summer
time
refresher
although
for
the
uninitiated
it
doesnt
seem
like
beer
at
all
a
sour
tart
beer
generally
served
in
a
squat
glass
with
red
raspberry
or
green
woodruf
sauce
to
offset
the
tartness
this
is
the
beer
to
give
to
people
who
find
most
beer
too
bitter
i
have
seen
different
methods
for
pouring
the
beer
and
the
sauce
generally
with
the
sauce
going
in
first
followed
by
the
beer
i
prefer
it
poured
with
a
thick
head
and
the
sauce
over
the
beer
stays
a
little
more
tart
while
you
get
a
slightly
sweeter
head
the
two
mix
in
your
mouth
for
a
subtle
difference
over
the
sauce
first
method
one
of
my
favorites
from
way
back
i
would
drink
this
beer
anyday
i
love
this
beer
with
a
capitol
l
but
none
of
my
friends
cared
for
it
at
all
more
for
me
a
perfect
summertime
sipper
and
at
2
5
abv
you
can
drink
all
you
want
cheers
extremely
drinkable
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
with
the
low
abv
it
is
a
great
hot
weather
beer
ill
often
start
out
a
night
at
the
brickstore
in
atlanta
with
one
of
these
just
to
quench
my
thirst
and
prime
my
palate
for
some
serious
lambics
bar
none
there
is
no
beer
id
rather
session
on
a
hot
summer
day
perfectly
clean
and
crisp
refreshing
and
enjoyable
the
perfect
beer
for
summer
and
better
without
syrup
in
my
opinion
although
pricey
well
worth
the
refreshment
when
the
temperature
climbs
my
biggest
regret
is
not
buying
this
the
first
time
i
saw
it
at
a
local
shop
it
can
be
very
hard
to
find
even
in
larger
cities
i
have
never
had
schultheiss
but
i
will
definitely
pick
it
up
if
i
have
the
chance
some
have
claimed
it
has
a
more
complicated
set
of
flavors
but
ill
have
to
see
for
myself
drinkability
is
ok
it
would
be
a
great
cooler
in
the
summer
heat
this
is
not
my
first
choice
taste
but
some
may
have
it
it
was
not
foul
or
offensive
just
not
a
style
i
like
at
first
kind
of
like
corona
or
an
american
wheat
with
lots
of
lemon
i
would
try
it
again
mk
overall
a
refreshing
low
abv
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
however
the
tartness
diminishes
the
drinkability
light
mouth
with
prickly
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
i
will
buy
more
as
this
could
be
the
ultimate
summer
session
brew
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
this
but
i
suppose
i
like
it
it
certainly
is
quite
the
session
brew
though
i
couldnt
deal
with
a
night
of
drinking
fruit
beer
its
not
something
id
drink
often
but
im
headed
to
germany
this
summer
and
i
can
imagine
the
appeal
of
sipping
this
in
a
cafe
at
lunch
edit
tried
this
from
a
bottle
without
syrup
very
interesting
sour
flavor
i
prefer
it
with
just
a
small
amount
of
the
green
syrup
as
opposed
to
raspberry
id
be
interested
to
try
this
with
raspberry
or
woodruff
syrup
but
honestly
i
wouldnt
be
expecting
much
its
just
a
light
refreshing
substitute
for
water
or
a
wine
cooler
basically
this
is
a
novelty
thats
only
made
for
beer
nerds
still
interesting
in
trying
the
style
an
endangered
species
kept
alive
at
a
the
beer
zoo
sharp
acidic
aroma
apple
or
grapelike
fruity
aromas
hint
of
hard
cider
but
not
exactly
perhaps
better
described
as
floral
basically
clear
with
slight
haze
pale
yellow
color
small
lingering
head
tastes
like
it
smells
sharp
sourness
with
light
fruitiness
sourness
lingers
well
into
the
finish
and
as
the
sourness
fades
it
gives
way
to
a
bready
wheat
flavor
no
hop
character
whatsoever
mediumlight
body
high
carbonation
and
acidity
seems
to
increase
perception
of
mouthfeel
all
in
all
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
before
and
might
never
have
the
chance
again
i
enjoyed
it
it
was
definitely
an
experience
to
remember
i
dont
think
id
buy
a
case
of
the
stuff
but
it
might
be
nice
to
sample
on
occasion
i
mixed
the
last
few
gulps
with
a
few
drops
of
raspberry
liqueur
now
that
was
tasty
still
very
sour
but
the
little
sugar
helped
balance
out
some
of
the
acidity
thats
the
way
to
drink
it
its
good
on
its
own
but
better
with
some
flavor
to
balance
out
the
sourness
pale
dull
yellow
slight
off
white
head
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
looks
to
be
present
aroma
is
lemony
tart
citric
and
tangy
wow
is
this
some
interesting
stuff
only
2
5
the
flavor
is
tart
and
a
little
sour
but
not
overly
so
it
adds
some
refreshing
qualities
tangy
wheats
add
some
quenching
ability
as
well
lemony
qualities
carbonation
is
nice
body
is
almost
medium
this
is
pretty
good
i
keep
drinking
it
this
brew
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
greenish
tint
and
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
the
head
is
twofingers
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
the
aroma
is
sour
and
almost
lambic
like
with
some
tartness
too
the
taste
is
quite
impressive
for
a
beer
with
so
little
alcohol
quite
impressive
for
any
beer
actually
it
is
like
a
mild
unblendedlambic
with
equal
parts
sour
and
tart
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
brew
i
hate
to
tell
my
friend
that
i
think
his
beer
is
soured
although
deliberate
this
is
soured
beyond
what
sour
beers
normally
display
lemony
and
musky
in
the
aroma
with
a
sharp
and
thin
scent
flavors
of
lemonheads
and
lemon
rinds
with
a
vineous
astringency
thin
and
light
on
the
palate
with
a
puckering
sensation
all
through
the
mouth
highly
carbonated
and
dry
despite
the
low
alcohol
clean
and
crisp
yet
tough
to
drink
a
murky
yellow
high
carbonated
beer
with
a
whallop
of
a
punch
a
treat
for
the
serious
beer
drinker
move
along
first
time
trying
this
style
how
many
of
this
type
could
this
be
at
2
5
abv
im
not
sure
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
think
the
tartness
would
get
to
me
before
that
however
dry
and
to
the
point
this
could
be
a
favorite
among
those
looking
for
a
half
beer
half
wine
cooler
cool
looking
bottle
body
is
razor
thin
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
but
it
just
feels
like
club
soda
in
my
mouth
airey
light
texture
i
could
see
this
as
a
summer
quencher
nothing
else
my
first
berliner
weisse
i
have
tried
not
the
season
for
them
but
availablepoured
a
lighter
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
quick
to
vanish
head
hmm
quite
lactic
and
tart
like
green
grapes
aroma
wise
almost
a
guezelikeness
to
it
with
the
grapeskin
and
lactic
thing
going
onquite
sour
upfront
on
the
palate
with
a
touch
of
iron
but
drys
out
in
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
wheat
not
fond
of
the
fizzythin
mouthfeel
i
know
its
very
low
in
alc
a
summer
quencher
yeah
i
can
see
it
but
not
something
i
would
try
again
drinkability
berliner

abv
making
this
an
easy
session
beer
when
paired
with
himbeer
getrankesirup
raspberry
syrup
this
is
the
authentic
german
syrup
available
at
wells
discount
liquors
this
ale
takes
on
a
much
sweeter
character
in
which
the
syrup
balances
out
the
lactose
this
one
certainly
caught
me
off
guard
as
i
was
totally
unfamiliar
with
this
style
part
of
the
beeradvocate
experience
is
the
adventure
of
sampling
new
styles
such
as
this
one
a
low
alcohol
bier
that
is
totally
different
than
any
other
style
yet
is
well
made
and
quite
enjoyable
lemony
and
green
apple
tartness
with
airy
carbonation
and
a
light
body
give
this
one
an
excellent
drinkability
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
little
bottle
of
berliner
kindl
weisse
now
thats
its
gone
im
still
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
i
like
sour
in
all
its
forms
but
this
beer
seemed
to
lack
something
essential
probably
the
syrup
im
glad
for
curiositys
sake
that
i
gave
it
a
try
but
i
doubt
there
will
be
any
more
berliner
weissbiers
in
my
future
overall
i
can
see
sucking
back
many
of
these
on
a
warm
day
despite
the
beers
diminutive
size
2

abv
there
is
a
load
of
flavor
to
go
around
a
very
charming
beer
330
ml
bottle
the
joy
of
trying
a
new
style
of
beer
the
berliner
kindl
weiss
pours
out
a
a
very
clear
light
color
with
a
rapidly
diminishing
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
with
sour
apple
fruitiness
sour
lemony
flavor
so
that
at
first
you
can
just
barely
taste
the
wheat
tart
apple
skins
more
wheat
flavor
in
the
finish
no
hop
flavor
at
all
a
little
bit
salty
fuller
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
great
drinkability
i
would
think
that
fans
of
sour
beers
would
enjoy
this
i
would
like
to
try
another
example
of
the
style
for
comparison
330

abv
is

i
had
no
raspberry
syrup
available
so
i
drank
it
straight
extremely
pale
straw
coloured
nearly
clear
just
a
very
slight
haziness
enormous
to
moderate
head
unusual
funky
aroma
sea
water
seaweed
notes
of
barnyard
horseblanket
and
rotting

very
sour
acidic
flavour
but
not
as
extreme
as
i
expected
lemony
notes
light
bodied
watery
mouthfeel
despite
the
acidity
refreshing
but
i
find
very
little
complexity
here
moderate
lemony
aftertaste
i
give
it
high
drinkability
i
like
this
stuff
i
could
do
lots
of
it
and
with
an
abv
of
2
5
it
would
be
easy
berliner
weisse
are
classic
thirst
quenchers
and
thus
popular
in
summer
highly
sour
and
refreshing
since
napoleon
invaded
berlin
some
200years
ago
it
seems
to
have
the
nick
berlin
champagne
not
sure
the
reference
was
made
to
the
same
beer
berliner
kindl
is
the
bigger
of
the
two
big
berlin
breweries
their
weisse
has
a
hoppy
smell
and
tastes
somewhat
like
tangerines
kept
in
a
saucer
full
of
fresh
lemon
juice
mix
it
with
woodruff
of
rasberry
syrup
and
you
have
the
perfect
drink
for
a
summer
afternoon
d
this
is
a
very
dynamic
beer
for
having
only
2
5
abv
it
has
lots
of
characteristics
that
are
not
common
to
most
beers
it
has
some
good
wild
beer
notes
but
it
would
be
nice
to
see
more
of
them
i
do
prefer
them
red
or
green
with
the
syrups
but
it
is
refreshing
on
its
own
an
interesting
beer
that
i
must
try
again
on
a
really
hot
day
the
expense
of
this
beer
makes
it
hard
to
justify
buying
a
whole
6
pack
light
gold
in
colour
and
well
carbonated
with
a
slightly
floral
aroma
along
with
some
white
grapefruit
notes
very
sour
citrus
flavor
with
a
lactic
note
and
a
short
finish
light
mouthfeel
i
normally
enjoy
sour
flavors
and
weizens
are
a
favorite
style
of
mine
but
this
one
was
a
little
too
astringent
to
fully
enjoy
and
didnt
have
much
complexity
either
sourness
acidity
confirmed
tart
lemony
tinge
throughout
quick
dry
finish
with
a
little
bit
of
flintiness
oddly
refreshing
light
spritzy
a
thirst
quencher
i
wish
there
were
more
versions
of
this
style
available
in
the
states
but
this
is
the
only
one
ive
come
across
i
guess
this
could
easily
be
considered
a
childs
drink
especially
if
you
mix
with
syrups
but
id
still
like
to
see
where
else
this
could
go
man
this
is
an
odd
brew
really
different
poured
out
to
a
nice
light
yellow
color
with
a
touch
of
cloudiness
no
lace
but
the
head
hung
around
for
a
bit
odors
of
sweet
malt
and
grain
were
noted
flavor
was
very
odd
sour
and
tart
this
beer
is
sometimes
mixed
with
flavored
syrup
and
i
can
see
why
as
on
its
own
its
not
that
great
finished
like
balsamic
vinegar
i
would
try
this
beer
again
if
i
had
some
of
those
syrups
ive
heard
about
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
worth
a
try
when
you
want
to
sample
something
different
because
of
the
high
acidity
the
head
went
poof
but
the
slightly
sour
nose
was
always
prominent
i
tried
the
beer
straight
with
woodruff
syrup
and
raspberry
syrup
the
straight
beer
is
straw
yellow
and
very
sour
with
that
lacto
finish
the
woodruff
has
a
cloying
medicinal
flavour
and
i
found
hard
to
finish
the
raspberry
is
the
most
pleasing
with
the
sweetness
helping
overcome
the
tartness
to
be
honest
this
is
a
hard
to
love
style
of
beer
as
the
high
acidity
plays
havoc
with
your
digestion
and
finding
the
syrups
is
difficult
at
best
pours
with
just
a
little
more
pigment
than
a
michelob
ultra
which
places
it
just
on
the
yellow
side
of
water
half
inch
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
nose
was
mellow
with
just
a
hint
of
the
wheat
used
to
brew
this
ah
the
flavor
first
taken
sans
syrup
my
lips
folded
into
my
mouth
as
the
alum
forced
a
major
pucker
very
very
lemony
i
ordered
with
an
apple
syrup
flavor
also
the
blend
was
very
smooth
sweet
and
sour
mix
like
a
beery
soft
drink
i
could
see
the
flavored
version
being
a
favorite
quencher
in
lieu
of
a
heavier
beer
or
an
overly
fruity
lambic
mouthfeel
w
syrup
is
medium
and
satisfying
drinkability
w
syrup
is
very
good
i
recommend
that
you
at
least
give
one
a
sip
without
the
syrup
but
to
really
enjoy
do
as
the
locals
apparently
do
and
add
the
flavor
i
drank
this
in
the
absence
of
any
flavouring
as
is
traditional
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
it
was
my
first
experience
with
the
style
and
overall
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
raspberry

and

with
a
sour
character
and

flavor
very
little
wheat
to
be
found
the
finish
is
dry
fruity
and
astringent
below
average
all
around
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
the
low
abv
and
refreshing
nature
of
the
beer
make
it
drinkable
but
i
think
after
more
than
a
couple
the
acidity
and
sourness
might
wear
on
the
palate
overall
i
would
recommend
this
especially
on
a
hot
day
thin
silky
head
on
a
grey
yellow
color
body
the
smell
seems
like
a
mix
of
straw
whole
milk
and
citrus
with
notes
reminiscent
of
a
barn
intriguing
and
interesting
the
taste
is
fresh
citric
with
a
dry
malty
character
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
velvety
reminding
me
of
oatmeal
after
the
specific
berliner
taste
thats
sour
acidic
and
slightly
vinegary
but
controlled
and
enjoyable
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
grainy
like
in
many
german
pilsners
but
i
find
it
quite
enjoyable
here
as
it
adds
to
the
refreshing
character
of
the
brew
surprizingly
drinkable
amazingly
some
tartness
still
comes
through
in
this
beer
despite
the
sweet
raspberry

and
satisfying

that
dies
off
quickly
there
is

lacing
the
smell
is
slightly
spicy
and
has
some
tart

character
to
it
the
taste
is
fairly
tart
with
lots
of
sweet
maltiness
trying
to
balance
it
out
almost
puckering
sour
but
very
refreshing
i
think
it
would
match
nicely
with
pizza
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
something
you
wouldnt
expect
for
this
type
of
beer
especially
with
only
2
5
abv
the
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
low
alcohol
and
cooling
sensation
that
it
brings
to
the

decent

big
fizz

and
puckering
a

abv
this
prototypical
classic
berliner
weisse
is
an
incredibly
refreshing
and
drinkable
ale
its
just
slightly
hazy
straw
gold
body
displays
its
delicately
effervescent
bubbles
beneath
a
short
head
of
bright
white
the
head
retention
is
limited
but
it
does
leaves
some
nice
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
offers
lightly
tart
wheat
and
nothing
else
which
is
basically
whats
found
in
the
flavor
theres
very
little
bitterness
at
all
but
its
not
needed
as
the
mild
acidity
dries
it
out
its
basic
but
interesting
and
absolutely
thirst
quenching
and
drinkable
it
has
a
lovely
sourness
like
good
apple
cider
vinegar
right
off
the
bat
im
surprised
with
the
body
its
certainly
a
light
beer
but
it
has
great
presence
on
the
palate
good
mouthfeel
it
has
a
mineral
taste
reminiscent
of
club
soda
the
sourness
doesnt
linger
some
ceylon
cinnamon
wow
this
is
quenching
quaint
and
quaffable
a
new
beer
family
for
me
and
i
like
it
no
i
love
it
i
really
need
to
drink
a
case
of
this
at
2
5
i
could
and
then
i
would
try
the
syrup
my
first
berliner
weisse
so
lets
see
what
this
has
in
store
for
me
i
tried
to
order
this
at
the
german
place
in
town
but
they
insisted
that
i
have
a
syrup
in
it
and
i
wanted
to
have
it
without
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
top
the
nose
is
slightly
grainey
slightly
lemoney
tart
okay
the
flavor
is
pretty
darn
interesting
lemoney
sourtart
hits
first
with
an
understory
of
grainey
but
not
harsh
flavors
interesting
beer
i
find
it
very
refreshing
the
feel
is
thin
with
a
very
big
carbonation
i
could
sit
down
to
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
night
enjoyable
smooth
easy
to
drink
nice
brew
well
this
is
interesting
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
a
beer
into
which
you
are
supposed
to
pour
syrup
poured
into
its
own
special
glass
flat
bottom
extremely
wide
and
short
green
or
raspberry
syrup
on
the
side
the
sour
smell
is
very
sour
which
i
was
warned
about
tried
it
without
the
syrup
yup
very
sour
so
experimented
with
the
syrup
the
green
poured
some
in
swished
around
tasted
hum
alittle
more
try
again
ok
alittle
more
well
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
really
dont
know
how
to
score
the
taste
as
it
was
not
good
too
sour
but
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
alittle
too
sweet
in
between
it
was
good
plenty
bubbly
felt
good
too
but
just
too
damn
much
work
to
be
drinkable
drinkability
well
i
guess
no
need
to
try
anymore
of
this
style
or
at
least
this
brand
too
out
there
more
me
almost
tasted
a
bit
salty
overall
as
i
said
its
an
interesting
flavor
although
i
cant
imagine
having
this
one
again
any
time
in
the
near
future
sure
glad
i
tried
it
though
nose
is
sour
grainy
and
greenmalty
alltogether
intresting
and
good
for
the
low
amount
of
alcohol
taste
is
also
sour
malty
clean
but
without
to
much
body
what
influences
the
mouthfeel
negative
aftertaste
is
good
fresh
and
litle
sourish
again
but
not
overdone
good
beer
for
warm
sunny
days
overall
my
first
for
the
style
striking
similiarity
to
geuze
but
lighter
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
it
is
a
verrry
sour
apple
taste
not
much
else
to
it
i
wouldnt
even
be
able
to
begin
to
pick
apart
the
maltinesshoppiness
of
it
all
not
to
mention
the
different
yeast
esters
and
whatnot
since
the
sour
apple
was
all
i
could
taste
i
was
hoping
for
something
much
more
drinkable
especially
considering
the
extremely
low
abv
i
had
a
bad
enough
time
trying
to
finish
the
bottle
though
i
had
hoped
to
move
on
from
belgians
to
german
beer
but
i
dont
think
this
was
the
right
choice
for
the
job
i
could
easily
say
this
is
the
second
most
disgusting
beer
ive
had
next
to
the
petrus
pale
ale
but
only
because
i
was
able
to
finish
this
one
since
it
was
slightly
less
acidic
tasting
i
dont
know
what
ill
do
with
the
remaining
5
perhaps
try
to
pawn
them
off
on
my
friends
or
of
course
i
would
trade
to
somebody
on
this
sight
who
actually
likes
it
afterall
this
is
one
of
the
last
batches
of
of
the
berliner
kindle
weisse
you
will
likely
see
and
id
rather
somebody
who
enjoys
it
have
the
pleasure
of
finishing
the
last
batch
this
is
a
nice
beer
poured
clear
bright
and
light
yellowy
light
and
golden
color
thin
head
at
first
then
dissapeared
the
aroma
has
a
distinctive
sour
lemony
hay
note
very
pleasant
and
appetizing
like
a
lemon
lime
spritzer
the
taste
is
light
and
appealing
i
once
had
this
beer
in
berlin
with
raspberry
juice
and
it
was
burned
into
my
memory
as
one
of
my
favorite
beer
experiences
this
brings
me
back
a
little
the
sourness
in
the
taste
is
refreshing
its
just
right
not
too
puckering
or
overwhelming
it
borders
on
lambicville
overall
this
is
another
fine
beer
experience
maybe
better
enjoyed
as
a
hot
day
thirst
quencher
and
not
a
cold
snowy
day
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
light
white
head
that
leaves
just
a
slight
lace
green
apples
mixed
with
a
tart
and
sour
tone
make
up
the
aromas
of
this
brew
initial
flavors
are
a
spritzy
mix
of
sour
apples
and
slight
wheat
tones
with
a
tart
and
slight
acidic
finish
the
mouthfeel
to
this
brew
was
somewhat
dissapointing
because
the
body
was
quite
thin
but
this
is
probably
due
to
the
low
alcohol
levels
of
this
brew
and
its
usage
as
a
thirst
quencher
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
for
a
hot
summers
day
but
this
isnt
currently
doing
it
for
me
considering
it
is
4
degrees
outside
right
now
yep
its
a
little
puckering
lambicguezelike
in
its
tart
sourness
kinda
like
lemon
juice
too
i
can
see
why
the
berlin
folk
often
add
syrup
but
at
the
same
time
im
glad
to
be
trying
this
in
its
raw
form
stays
tart
but
a
traces
of
mellow
wheatcereal
malt
poke
through
before
and
into
the
finish
lacks
complexity
but
i
guess
its
only
2
5
abv
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
would
be
quite
refreshing
if
it
werent
so
tart
i
wouldnt
drink
this
every
day
but
i
do
like
it
the
first
and
only
as
of
yet
berliner
style
weiss
ive
had
incredibly
drinkable
all
i
can
think
of
is
a
hot
summer
day
forget
those
pilsners
much
more
drinkable
than
belgian
wits
yet
lighter
than
regular
german
weiss
beers
there
is
zero
hints
of
those
expected
phenols
from
german
wheat
beers
which
i
love
yet
i
was
fully
satisfied
with
what
this
beer
had
to
offer
not
much
head
to
speak
of
nor
much
aroma
only
a
slight
citrussour
note
a
bit
tart
this
beer
is
delicious
toms
of
flavor
tart
citrus
such
as
grapefruit
lemon
with
a
lovely
sourdry
finish
lingers
in
your
mouth
begging
for
one
more
probably
one
of
the
best
hot
day
session
beers
ever
i
will
keep
in
mind
to
try
more
beers
of
this
style
drink
this
badboy
cold
as
it
warmed
it
became
almost
too
acidic
odd
little
beer
but
i
might
drink
again
kind
of
like
zotz
candy
in
a
beer
drinkability

this
is
not
even
close
to
what
i
was
expecting
i
dont
know
why
i
even
finished
the
bottle
what
a
strange
brew
pours
out
a
very
pale
yellowgolden
color
with
a
nice
head
that
wears
off
eventually
smell
consisted
of
lemon
aromas
some
slight
yeast
sour
like
almost
on
the
border
of
geuzelambic
with
the
sour
aromas
taste
was
a
little
weird
huge
lemon
flavors
rush
towards
the
palate
with
some
tart
flavors
mixing
in
as
well
finishes
on
the
clean
side
to
my
surprise
a
little
spritzy
as
well
i
have
to
try
a
few
of
these
to
see
if
i
like
this
beer
or
not
a
really
out
there
style
this
is
one
of
two
beers
i
pored
out
in
my
life
due
to
taste
two
friends
also
refused
to
adopt
the
glass
after
they
tasted
it
it
seems
that
many
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
will
not
be
visiting
it
again
nor
can
i
recommend
it
what
is
the
intent
of
this
beer
i
could
see
draining
a
few
after
a
brisk
summer
hike
but
the
sourness
might
tear
your
throat
up
quick
perhaps
a
rinse
for
potatoe
salad
cold
brats
and
mustard
with
deli
havarti
melted
onto
crusty
bread
lecker
my
first
berliner
weisse
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
too
poured
slightly
cloudy
and
somewhat
grassy
yellowish
color
a
bone
white
very
compact
head
with
tight
little
bubbles
of
carbonation
flavor
was
almost
nonexistant
with
just
a
slight
fruitiness
to
it
no
real
grain
flavor
but
i
detected
a
little
oxidation
so
im
not
sure
of
the
freshness
but
it
was
well
within
the
drink
by
date
on
the
bottle
crisp
spritzy
mouthfeel
that
ended
with
a
sourtart
bite
not
that
impressed
but
its
probably
better
when
fresh
and
i
will
seek
out
others
within
the
style
pours
a
lightly
hazy
yellowstraw
color
and
is
topped
by
a
white
head
and
a
fairly
low
level
of
carbonation
a
sour
lemony
aroma
rises
up
to
my
nose
there
is
a
hint
of
complexity
in
the
nose
some
herbal
grassiness
perhaps
this
is
very
dry
and
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
was
hoping
it
is
quite
soft
up
front
but
has
a
sharp
sourness
in
the
finish
that
is
reminiscent
of
fresh
lemonade
though
light
bodied
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
creamy
fullness
to
this
beer
certainly
this
is
nice
and
refreshing
but
lacks
a
certain
complexity
that
i
like
and
can
be
found
in
schultheiss
version
the
beer
after
disemboguing
from
the
11
1
ounce
light
brown
bottle
into
my
berlin
kindl
weisse
glass
a
somewhat
luteolous
color
the
head
is
modest
in
size
and
evaporates
quickly
leaving
a
velum
like
film
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
citrus
crisp
sweet
and
sour
light
hints
of
yeast
start
is
quite
sour
as
i
tried
it
with
out
the
syrup
light
malt
profile
the
top
skimpy
in
its
feel
finish
is
astringent
dry
as
a
desert
bleached
bone
the
hops
quite
mild
all
in
all
not
a
bad
maybe
i
need
to
add
a
touch
of
raspberry
syrup
as
i
was
advised
drinkability
is
low
for
me
perhaps
high
for
others
but
this
isnt
my
thing
i
have
no
interest
into
delving
deeper
into
this
beer
style
this
seems
one
dimensional
and
i
dont
care
for
that
dimension
more
power
to
you
if
you
enjoy
this
style
its
just
not
for
me
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
true
to
style
and
a
decent
example
from
what
ive
read
thie
beer
pours
very
light
in
color
although
it
is
more
amber
than
it
is
hoegaarden
gold
it
has
a
medium
frothy
head
and
smells
of
wheat
and
alcohol
it
tastes
of
medium
bitnerness
with
a
heavy
wheat
flavor
like
an
excellent
american
wheat
but
not
really
like
most
belgian
whites
that
i
have
had
weisse
is
very
light
and
drinkable
though
and
i
will
probably
have
another
on
account
of
its
smoothness
i
had
to
try
this
beer
after
reading
some
about
the
style
i
dont
know
if
there
will
be
another
time
when
i
get
to
try
this
style
the
beer
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
went
down
to
a
mm
size
above
the
beer
lots
of
bubbles
raced
to
the
top
and
they
continued
to
do
that
for
almost
the
whole
time
the
smell
was
quite
sour
and
a
bit
wheaty
the
taste
was
not
near
as
sour
as
the
smell
i
still
noticed
the
sourness
but
it
wasnt
like
a
gueze
the
body
was
extremely
light
and
airy
that
left
for
an
odd
sensation
of
lightness
combined
with
a
sour
aspect
i
have
never
really
experienced
that
there
was
a
slighly
wheaty
undertone
to
this
beer
as
well
i
actually
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommene
everybody
to
try
this
once
personally
i
dont
see
how
the
syrup
would
help
this
beer
at
all
it
is
so
light
that
it
seems
like
syrup
would
oversweeten
it
imo
the
only
true
drawback
to
this
beer
is
the
price
3
29
for
11
2
oz
is
that
normal
seemed
a
little
outrageous
esp
for
a
2
5
abv
beer
still
i
am
glad
i
had
it
it
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
like
i
said
though
just
understand
before
drinking
it
that
it
is
a
sour
mashed
brew
id
recommend
you
try
this
beer
as
long
as
you
know
what
to
expect
really
an
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
just
for
summer
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
id
buy
it
with
some
regularity
mouthfeel
is
excellent
as
the
low
level
of
carbonation
just
prickles
through
to
provide
some
respite
from
the
acidity
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
very
modest
malt
content
very
drinkable
and
in
quantity
a
really
pleasant
companion
for
fatty
sausage
or
cold
cuts
330

poured

became
light
chartreuse
with
a
full
white
head
and
fine
carbonation
head
dies
quickly
and
there
is
little
lace
the
aroma
is
tart
and
yeasty
with
some

hops
the
flavor
is
tart
and
lemonade
like
but
low
one
sweet
some
hop
bite
follows
up

tart
and

a
fun
and
refreshing

well
this
is
interesting
small
bottle
small
alcohol
content
served
with
raspberry
syrup
is
this
really
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
did
not
get
much
lace
though
could
not
find
much
of
a
smell
the
taste
is
primarily
one
sensation
sour
this
stuff
will
make
you
pucker
i
could
say
however
that
it
was
refreshing
this
would
be
good
to
revisit
in
the
summer
even
though
it
was
so
sour
i
found
it
to
be
drinkable
the
syrup
was
a
nice
touch
but
i
could
have
this
plain
this
was
a
very
interesting
experience
this
beer
can
make
you
appreciate
the
wide
arrays
of
taste
that
beer
has
to
offer
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
with
syrup
i
drank
this
beer
with
a
sour
apple
syrup
its
kind
of
hard
for
me
to
say
what
i
think
about
this
beer
since
its
not
really
the
conventional
beer
also
i
have
only
tried
it
once
and
with
the
syrup
so
i
couldnt
tell
you
how
it
tastes
straight
from
the
bottle
the
taste
of
it
the
way
i
had
was
sour
and
obviously
fruity
it
basically
tasted
like
candy
and
not
like
a
beer
i
do
however
like
sour
drinks
and
cant
knock
the
taste
it
was
good
for
the
experience
but
ill
have
to
try
it
without
the
syrup
next
time
small
11
1
oz
bottle
this
is
the
first
time
i
had
a
beer
of
this
style
poured
a
nice
fill
head
that
lasted
a
few
minutes
very
clear
pale
yellow
color
not
much
smell
picked
up
some
malt
as
it
warms
tastesour
not
bitter
more
like
a
lemon
it
almost
makes
you
pucker
up
you
lips
on
a
hot
day
you
would
think
youre
drinking
lemonaide
after
you
get
past
the
initial
sour
shock
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
the
low
abv
this
could
be
a
good
hot
day
drink
more
then
a
few
beer
source
liquid
solutions
pours
a
light
golden
and
crystal
clear
liquid
the
head
is
a
puffy
white
initially
towering
foam
the
head
quickly
settles
into
stillness
aroma
is
an
intense
and
familiar
wheat
beer
twang
lemon
rind
and
citrus
are
quite
serious
in
the
smell
taste
is
slightly
sour
throughout
very
refreshing
light
sprtzy
and
very
drinkable
this
would
be
fantastic
on
a
dusy
dry
hot
day
this
is
the
epitome
of
berliner
weiss
light
blond
active
liquid
with
a
big
bubbled
head
a
faint
scent
of
wheat
and
corn
husks
sugary
sweet
corn
and
butter
the
flavor
starts
kind
of
like
white
vinegar
and
gets
some
wheat
and
grain
on
it
in
the
middle
but
then
tarts
up
like
crazy
and
eventually
leaves
a
bit
of
dry
white
wine
flavors
pinot
g
or
dry
reisling
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
filling
active
and
refreshing
i
didnt
use
any
syrups
or
added
flavorings
but
that
might
be
a
good
idea
this
was
one
unique
beer
i
had
to
think
that
the
drinkability
was
average
depending
on
the
mood
when
are
you
going
to
get
in
this
mood
maybe
never
but
it
was
a
good
beer
all
said
and
done
drank
clean
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
rushes
to
leave
nothing
behind
aroma
is
strongly
sour
and
citric
flavor
follows
with
a
mouthpuckering
sourness
and
bone
dry
finish
the
sourness
of
this
medium
bodies
brew
sticks
around
forever
i
can
see
this
being
somewhat
refreshing
if
mixed
with
a
syrup
or
something
to
offset
the
overpowering
sourness
with
raspberry
syrup
for
sodascoffee
just
a
little
splash
made
it
nice
and
smooth
though
pinkish
of
course
the
tartness
remaining
gave
it
an
edge
over
most
raspberry
beers
probably
might
even
be
well
matched
with
a
7up
wow
never
ever
thought
id
review
a
2
5
abv
beer
bright
white
foamy
head
fades
fast
leaves
no
head
incredibly
clear
light
wheat
colored
beer
smells
a
little
sour
tart
lemon
flavor
is
dominant
theres
a
light
weisse
flavor
in
there
somewhere
the
body
is
very
thin
and
the
aftertaste
is
dry
definitely
wasnt
expecting
the
tart
flavor
but
its
quite
enjoyable
cheers
this
beer
poured
a
clear
fizzy
yellow
color
with
tall
creamy
white
foam
that
clung
to
the
glass
a
little
bit
the
smell
was
citrusy
with
wheat
malt
and
a
very
faint
hint
of
sulfur
overall
not
an
unpleasant
aroma
the
taste
was
souttart
with
light
malt
and
a
light
fruitiness
and
some
citrus
there
was
no
hop
presence
detectable
there
was
a
lingering
slight
tartness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
tart
with
thin
body
but
good
carbonation
this
was
a
fairly
refreshing
wheat
beer
but
with
thin
body
i
would
like
to
sample
it
with
some
added
fruit
syrup
with
the
addition
of
the
traditional
raspberry
syrup
the
beer
was
nicely
completed
only
a
sour
and
even
beer
like
this
could
handle
the
addition
of
a
high
concentration
and
not
throw
strange
flavors
though
id
prefer
without
originally
sampled
on
22
february
2003
i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
it
poured
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
the
lightest
colored
beer
ive
ever
seen
w
a
big
white
head
fully
of
tiny
bubbles
the
flavor
starts
out
very
tart
but
finishes
smoothly
its
an
interesting
beer
to
try
one
of
these
days
ill
try
it
w
the
syrup
squat
bottle
with
glass
that
is
not
quite
brown
and
not
quite
green
olive
should
have
gone
with
brown
aroma
had
a
slightly
skunked
smell
but
not
enough
to
be
offputting
hazy
straw
color
my
first
true
sour
wheat
style
although
ive
had
some
wheats
that
turned
out
that
way
unintentionally
lemony
mouthpuckering
sour
like
wheat
beer
dosed
with
ascorbic
acid
or
sweettart
candy
but
i
like
it
perfect
for
afternoon
lounging
on
the
patio
very
refreshing
despite
the
sourness
it
finished
quite
clean
and
dry
and
was
most
drinkable
a
touch
of
the
lightstruck
aspect
turned
up
again
at
the
finish
but
im
sure
this
would
not
be
the
case
with
a
sample
handled
with
more
respect
during
shipping
i
dont
really
know
what
to
make
of
this
that
subtle
hit
of
sour
is
pretty
much
the
only
thing
i
liked
about
this
very
light
texture
with
little
development
of
any
flavour
like
sour
lemonade
with
a
touch
of
grainy
malt
my
first
berliner
weisse
and
im
a
bit
let
down
and
confused
my
wife
is
from
germany
and
this
is
the
only
bier
she
drinks
except
for
an
altbier
with
fruit
in
it
which
is
known
as
an
altbier
bowle
anyway
i
tried
one
in
germany
a
couple
years
ago
dut
didnt
really
remember
it
that
well
until
tonight
when
i
finally
located
a
six
pack
and
the
authentic
raspberry
syrup
that
is
served
with
it
the
beer
is
very
light
in
color
and
looks
almost
like
an
american
lager
i
tried
it
first
without
the
raspberry
and
found
it
very
tart
and
sour
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
apple
not
really
refreshing
in
anyway
for
me
next
we
added
the
syrup
and
mixed
it
up
about
2
oz
seemed
like
the
right
amount
the
combination
of
tartness
and
sweetness
is
a
nice
blend
this
time
i
taste
green
apples
this
is
a
most
unusual
drink
and
is
worth
trying
once
it
is
also
served
with
a
green
syrup
made
with
the
herb
woodruff
my
scoring
is
based
on
the
beer
with
raspberry
syrup
added
i
like
it
this
poured

lightly
fruity
and
sharp
smelling
with
fresh
overtones
taste
is
shockingly
tart
with
up
front
acidity
i
chose
to
review
it
straight
up
without
added
fruit
syrup
and
a
short
musty
note
that
came
and
went
fleeting
bit
of
malty
mouthfeel
but
that
too
quickly
fades
finishes
fast
and
clean
with
a
refreshing
quality
with
no
one
dominant
feature
taking
charge
very
pale
not
as
pale
as
a
belgian
wit
but
paler
than
most
other
german
wheat
beer
styles
the
head
is
bright
white
and
builds
easily
but
fades
to
nothing
just
as
easily
this
really
is
a
tart
beer
as
tart
as
an
average
lambic
maybe
not
quite
the
tartness
fades
quickly
to
a
wheaty
finish
clean
crisp
dry
in
flavor
but
wet
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
easydrinking
and
light
but
not
exciting
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
orange
hue
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
down
the
glass
aroma
is
filled
with
tangy
citrus
and
wheat
nice
wheat
flavor
with
a
dry
finish
some
sweet
grapefruit
is
event
but
very
subdued
goes
down
real
easy
an
enjoyable
brew
but
there
are
better
beers
out
there
im
with
venom
on
this
one
who
needs
syrup
i
had
the
grenadine
at
the
ready
but
theres
no
way
it
ever
hit
the
glass
and
its
hardly
a
beer
with
2
5
abv
ill
stick
with
the
better
tasting
full
flavored
hefes
in
the
summertime
the
sourness
is
amazing
on
this
berliner
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
sour
power
clean
finish
really
makes
you
want
to
keep
drinking
it
refreshing
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
grain
and
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
fantastic
overall
its
a
plain
berliner
so
theres
not
much
to
look
for
its
mostly
clean
and
easy
to
drink
something
in
the
back
is
off
though
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
berliners
ive
ever
had
its
everything
i
want
in
a
bw
it
has
bright
crisp
clean
flavors
a
nice
tart
punch
good
lacto

is

light

true

the
style
im
happy
i
tried
it
and
would
have
more
3
0
d
its
tasty
but
it
falls
close
to
average
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
very
cool
and
interesting
beer
definitely
the
most
fruity
citrusy
version
of
the
style
i
can
remember
having
but
pretty
good
as
well
all
in
all
a
nice
drinkable
berliner
weissbier
and
one
i
would
order
again
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
which
is
quite
low
for
the
style
it
is
easy
drinking
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
seemingly
no
inclusion
of
alcohol
in
this
brew
i
really
appreciated
the
chance
to
give
this
brew
a
try
and
really
enjoyed
this
second
attempt
at
the
style
more
so
than
the
first
keep
it
up
brad
each
try
gets
better
and
better
golden
orange
color
with
a
the
slightest
haze
not
much
carbonation
a
few
whispy
white
bubbles
pop
up
here
and
there
aromas
are
of
tart
peach
and
lemon
very
citrusy
sour
aromas
flavor
is
cool
light
apricot
fruit
sweetness
up
front
with
an
evolving
sour
rush
of
tart
citrus
and
funky
dried
fruits
finish
is
quick
and
light
a
little
hint
of
a
metallic
note
pops
out
but
washes
back
away
in
the
funk
and
lingering
fruit
flavors
a
really
good
beer
hope
it
is
around
for
regular
brewpub
drinking
in
the
future
if
only
there
were
no
chlorine
notes
o
an
enjoyable
summer
beer
im
a
fan
lots
of
orange
citrus
very
refreshing
and
a
nice
level
of
tart
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
at
4
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
in
the
future
poured
into
a
jester
king
snifter
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
straw
color
fairly
clear
with
just
a
hint
of
bright
white
head
smells
a
bit
off
with
a
lemon
chemical
scent
and
some
grains
taste
is
lacking
as
well
and
somewhat
off
not
much
sourness
or
tartness
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
appreciate
this
is
a
summery
beverage
but
this
is
a
style
that
i
greatly
enjoy
and
there
are
far
better
examples
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
this
is
the
type
of
stuff
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
beer
does
not
improve
in
the
mouth
it
is
mildly
sour
on
the
finish
but
the
front
half
is
candy
like
and
sweet
with
caramel
notes
and
a
pretty
heavy
body
for
a
berleiner
oh
well
they
cant
all
be
winners
the
beer
is
transparent
and
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
full
of
lemon
flavors
with
a
slight
mustiness
about
it
while
the
flavor
wasnt
bad
i
found
it
a
bit
lacking
the
absence
of
any
lactic
sour
funky
notes
kept
this
beer
from
being
special
the
flavor
is
basically
a
light
summery
ale
with
lemon
flavors
and
a
subtle
musty
finish
i
really
enjoy
berliner
weissbier
but
this
one
came
up
a
bit
short
in
my
opinion
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
mikesgroove
for
sharing
this
one
at
an
impromptu
hobo
tasting
7
which
turned
out
to
be
a
good
time
in
an
ingles
parking
lot
out
of
the
trunk
of
my
audi
with
my
ar15
incheck
to
keep
the
haters
out
served
from
growler
into
a
southern
tier
tulip
poured
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
funk
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
funk
cherries
and
dark
fruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
yes
funk
yes
please
this
one
worked
really
well
together
and
came
together
nicely
the
funk
aspect
added
to
the
flavor
profiles
of
a
good
berline
weiss
are
quickly
becoming
a
favorite
for
me
and
this
one
is
no
exception
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
on
this
one
are
exceptional
i
could
easily
down
a
lot
of
this
one
in
one
sitting
with
no
problem
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
i
hope
to
sample
more
in
the
future
hint
hint
traders
overall
not
the
most
typical
version
of
the
style
but
it
really
worked
quite
well
the
extra
bit
of
tartness
really
came
across
very
nicely
and
gave
it
a
nice
little
punch
at
the
end
that
was
much
needed
another
classic
really
starting
to
love
this
brewery
pours
a
nice
semicloudy
light
apricot
color
with
a
good
thin
white
head
little
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
a
nice
amount
of
lactic
character
with
just
a
touch
of
light
funk
lingering
in
the
background
nice
tartness
comes
through
along
with
a
smidgen
of
grain
everything
is
light
and
airynothing
is
overwhelming
and
all
is
in
great
balance
moderate
carbonation
and
a
beautifully
dry
and
lactic
finish
well
done
i
talked
to
brad
about
this
and
read
the
description
and
found
this
beer
to
be
very
close
to
the
traditional
berliners
ive
had
despite
its
very
nontraditional
composition
brad
said
there
are
still
a
few
minor
tweaks
hed
like
to
give
this
beer
to
dial
it
in
perfectly
if
you
ask
me
this
one
is
about
perfect
already
the
beer
is
not
real
sour
but
it
is
an
easy
drinker
pours
a
light
murky
yellowish
orange
with
a
bit
of
nice
crisp
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
nicely
tart
and
sweet
a
light
funkiness
that
floats
over
a
wheaty
smell
tastes
lit
and
wheaty
with
a
twrtrness
that
is
very
subtle
and
melds
well
with
the
beer
overall
the
flavours
are
very
complimentary
it
aint
no
fritz
briem
but
im
really
starting
to
love
berliner
weiss
beers
onot
one
of
their
best
but
definetly
worth
a
try

okwas
expecting

still
not

what
to

the

as
a

and
i
am
not
sure
if
i
like
it
or
not
on

najas

im
not
sure
that
this
is
brewed
with

as
is
the
case
with
gose
but
it
certainly
has
a
saline
twang
mouthfeel
is

with
medium

prickly
crisp

if
you
liked
sweet

you
will
most

give
this

athletes
could
substitute
this
for
gatorade
overall
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
some
woodruff
syrup
is
a
must
with
this
style
of
beer
almost
over
the
top
citric
taste
i
was
not
wild
about
d
its
a
cool
fall
october
day
so
perhaps
this
style
is
out
of
season
my
plans
consist
of
watching
a
2
hour
freddie
mercury
documentary
with
my
pregnant
wife
so
a
750ml
bottle
at
only
3
is
the
perfect
match
enough
beer
to
last
the
movie
and
no
unwanted
buzz
to
sweeten
it
up
a
bit
i
am
adding
1oz
per
pour
of
framboise
liqueur
the
beer
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
but
the
extra
sweetness
as
suggested
by
the
bottle
really
elevates
the
beer
to
another
level
this
could
be
a
go
to
for
the
style
especially
at
10
a
bottle
a
light
and
highly
enjoyable
sour
beer
less
corny
and
more
complex
than
some
of
the
others
out
there
this
is
a
great
rendition
well
done
beer
from
the
bruery
4

overall
very
decent
and
balanced
brew
i
could
crush
a
pint
and
carry
on
my
day
i
couldnt
do
pint
after
pint
though
the
funk
could
get
too
much
this
brew
is
worthy
cheers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp

this
will
likely
never
be
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
fine
albeit
overpriced
for
what
it
is
o
refreshingly
easy
to
drink
seems
simple
in
description
but
so
complex
on
the
palate
low
abv
you
wont
get
bombed
on
this
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
simply
to
enjoy
a
great

hottenroth
feels
like
the
bruery
going
hard
on
some
william
eggleston
grind
full
spectrum
of
emotional
color
here
nestled
amongst
the
many
hued
sunsets
and
supermarket
promontories
and
prewar
lamps
tossing
their
many
hued
lights
there
is
something
pristinesinister
that
feels
utterly
appropriate
and
inextricable
from
the
total
composition
a
real
glassfull
of
considerate
juxtaposition
and
moral
play
overall
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
and
tartness
wellrounded
in
its
tart
and
funky
base
parameters
and
overall
a
decently
drinkable
and
even
refreshing
at
times
version
of
the
style
ive
not
had
many
chances
to
try
the
real
deal
so
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
sounds
like
something
thats
actually
in
this
beer
i
suppose
i
should
try
mixing
this
as
is
typically
suggested
but
for
some
reason
im
all
out
of
woodruff
pours
a
cloudy
deep
straw
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
the
aroma
is
sour
and
fruity
even
had
a
ketchup
like
smell
in
the
taste
lactic
tartness
sour
lemon
cooked
veggie
and
stale
wheat
bread
the
tart
refreshing
nature
of
this
beer
is
quite
remarkable
as
well
as
the
amount
of
flavor
in
a
3
1
abv
beer
medium
bodied
ale
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
berliner
weisse
not
the
cleanest
but
has
unique
character
worth
sharing
and
a
good
choice
for
those
fond
of
sour
ale
o
an
outstanding
berliner
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
it
certainly
leans
towards
the
sour
side
of
the
style
with
emphasis
taken
away
from
the
biscuity
wheat
qualities
traditionally
found
in
these
beers
wheat
notes
are
there
but
the
early
mid
through
the
finish
is
one
big
puckery
kiss
of
lemon
strawberry
and
even
some
tart
cherry
fairly
complex
flavor
profile
for
the
style
still
some
traditionalists
wont
enjoy
the
acidity
in
play
here
nevertheless
i
dig
this
beer
quite
a
bit
packing
an
inordinate
amount
of
flavor
pucker
and
complexity
into
a
tight
little
sub4
abv
package
the
bruerys
hottenroth
is
a
welcome
addition
to
my
summer
lineup
o
might
have
been
a
bad
bottle
but
the
label
does
say
it
is
a
berlin
style
tart
wheat
ale
and
tart
it
is
to
the
point
of
making
your
mouth
pucker
and
your
eyes
close
and
your
face
wince
the
label
also
says
souryum
not
here
an

me
this
a

notes

tastes
on
this
beer
this
a

the
rapidly

yeast
and
tonic
you
can
smell
the
sour
taste
is
very
light
like
drinking
tonic
water
with
lemon
zest
some
grassy
notes
and
wheat
decently
sour
but
not
puckeringly
so
feel
is
great
this
is
light
refreshing
easy
to
dink
with
high
carbonation
that
enhances
the
sour
taste
great
beer
super
easy
to
drink
good
pizza
beer
this
is
a
very
underrated
beer
i
think
because
of
the
price
point
and
abv
level
everyone
seems
to
give
big
points
to
rare
beers
just
because
they
are
rare
and
high
in
abv
i
think
this
is
my
summer
fishing
beer
for
the
future
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
it
has
a
perfect
amount
of
sour
to
it
and
drinks
very
refreshing
i
also
enjoyed
the
nose
a
lot
next
time
you
see
it
give
it
a
try
it
is
a
wonderful
berliner
weiss
m
lighter
bodied
superiorly
drinkable
boy
was
i
reluctant
to
pay
9
bucks
for
12
ounces
of
3
beer
but
the
bruery
is
the
bruery
and
i
am
a
sucker
so
i
let
it
rip
down
at
jakes
in
downtown
littleton
not
as
pale
as
most
berliners
its
got
just
a
hint
of
darker
malt
color
to
it
and
a
lacey
little
white
head
smells
lacto
sour
lemons
and
acid
but
i
smell
more
than
wheat
as
a
grain
maybe
a
touch
of
rye
or
something
in
the
copper
family
making
it
just
a
little
more
interesting
than
the
generic
wild
yeast
and
bacterial
fermentation
are
obvious
from
the
outset
citric
funk
dominates
above
the
lightest
grain
bill
ever
what
i
like
though
is
that
touch
of
something
other
than
white
wheat
it
gives
the
beer
a
desirability
all
of
its
own
i
dont
need
woodruff
or
cherry
syrup
for
this
i
want
it
on
its
own
ultra
light
in
body
carbonated
like
soda
this
is
a
really
odd
sensation
so
acidic
and
low
in
alcohol
it
would
be
a
chore
to
get
drunk
from
it
but
i
guess
thats
the
point
authentic
with
a
twist
another
winner
from
the
bruery
o
not
blown
away
but
i
enjoyed
this
more
sour
than
the
german
versions
ive
tried
and
not
a
whole
lot
of
typical
wheat
smellsflavors
not
terribly
complex
or
particularly
pretty
to
look
at
but
drinks
nicely
refreshing
overall
impressed
given
the
abv
nice
light
sour
not
a
bad
deal
for
8
very
ideal
session
bier
othe
low
alcohol
content
is
phenomenal
a
good
beer
at
an
amazing
abv
o
nice
welldone
berliner
with
a
restrained
level
of
tartness
its
not
in
the
same
class
as
tartare
or
the
fruited
floridaweisses
available
but
a
really
enjoyable
drink
nevertheless
recommended
o
a
great
summer
beer
very
low
alcohol
sessionable
o
a
light
crisp
lowalcohol
beer
with
a
refreshing
sourness
its
not
a
complex
beer
but
they
style
is
geared
for
that
i
really
do
appreciate
a
lot
of
the
beers
the
bruery
releases
but
they
should
really
consider
doing
4pk
releases
or
even
2pk
of
12oz
bottles
sometimes
you
feel
obliged
to
drink
the
full
bottle
in
one
sitting
when
you
dont
have
any
friends
around
and
even
a
light
beer
like
this
feels
like
too
much
for
the
palate
for
one
to
drink
all
by
themselves
a
great
berliner
weiss
for
sure
but
id
rather
have
multiple
servings
of
it
in
smaller
quantities
othis
is
an
interesting
flavorful
take
on
the
berliner
style
the
lemony
sourness
is
quite
puckering
but
it
works
well
against
the
full
body
of
this
beer
the
brew
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
for
just
over
3
and
doesnt
need
any
syrup
to
keep
it
interesting
that
being
said
this
berliner
is
the
lightest
or
most
refreshing
i
have
had
because
of
the
big
taste
and
body
overall
i
really
really
like
this
o
i
am
happy
to
have
found
this
on
tap
and
it
was
delicious
the
slight
tartness
was
refreshing
for
the
palate
and
not
sour
at
all
for
me
great
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
o
amazing
brew
taste
light
sweet
malt
quickly
taken
over
by
lemon
peel
and
unsweetened
apples
and
some
grape
juice
to
almost
a
wine
character
this
beer
is
dry
very
dry
tartness
is
big
but
not
over
whelming
o
smell
taste
pucker
up
repeat
this
is
a
great
berliner
weiss
ive
had
a
few
samples
of
this
in
the
past
that
tasted
like
vegetable
broth
this
bottle
did
not
instead
it
has
some
nice
wheat
lemon
and
tart
aspects
not
the
best
in
the
style
but
worth
a
try
ive
tried
this
several
times
and
never
had
a
consistent
experience
this
is
delightful
pours
a
cloudy
straw
with
a
head
that
fades
quickly
no
lacing
aroma
of
fresh
cut
tart
green
apples
nice
earthiness
notes
follow
tartness
hits
the
palate
front
and
center
with
nice
lemon
notes
finishes
dry
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
overall
this
might
be
the
best
summer
brew
on
the
market
bracingly
tart
and
very
refreshing
o
a
great
beer
very
light
and
refreshing
with
lots
of
sour
tartness
and
yeasty
wheat
characteristics
i
could
drink
this
all
day
o
i
have
limited
experience
with
this
style
that
being
said
i
have
had
better
this
is
an
enjoyable
style
though
so
with
only
having
had
a
handful
of
beers
in
this
style
i
have
liked
them
all
so
far
bottle
poured
in
teku
pours
straw
yellow
very
clear
two
finger
white
head
with
some
big
bubbles
once
they
fade
the
beer
looks
like
a
chardonnay
smell
is
slightly
funky
bready
some
citrus
taste
hits
you
with
pucker
right
up
front
sour
lemon
some
wheat
some
nice
sweetness
the
texture
is
very
light
leaves
your
mouth
watering
for
more
this
beer
is
very
good
an
easy
drinking
sour
thats
abv
is
close
to
water
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
great
sour
o
light
and
refreshing
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
tartnesssourness
not
intensely
tartsour
so
an
approachable
berliner
weissbier
to
get
started
with
enjoyable
and
definitely
one
i
would
have
again
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
hints
of
citrus
mostly
lemon
over
the
wheat
overall
just
a
nice
refreshing
beer
that
i
enjoyed
in
the
sun
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
that
i
have
tasted
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
unless
you
are
trying
to
get
drunk
as
it
is
only
3
1
alcohol
the
beer
is
a
light
cloudy
straw
typical
in
color
of
any
berliner
weisse
the
head
is
white
but
very
weak
in
substance
with
big
bubbles
fading
quickly
the
lacing
is
light
the
aroma
is
light
with
a
light
tartness
some
citrus
and
lots
of
bready
yeast
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
sour
the
taste
is
a
light
too
a
little
lemon
citrus
on
the
front
followed
by
a
little
muted
tartness
the
feel
is
medium
but
very
drinkable
overall
a
decently
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
but
not
tart
enough
to
be
an
awesome
berliner
o
overall
fantastic
berliner
exactly
what
you
want
from
the
style
great
summer
day
beer
total
4350
overall
this
is
the
best
berliner
weisse
ive
had
and
i
think
it
would
stand
up
to
comparison
to
most
belgian
sours
out
there
not
quite
the
sour
punch
of
a
lambic
but
the
quality
is
every
bit
as
good
as
a
cantillon
or
3f
odpretty
tasty
its
got
some
neat
stuff
going
on
at
3
1
its
very
agreeable
and
i
dont
really
have
anything
bad
to
say
about
it
just
happy
to
have
copped
a
bottle
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
bw
style
beer
to
date
ive
also
had
bells
oarsman
professor
fritz
briem
1809
and
dh
festina
peche
the
3
1
abv
also
makes
it
easy
to
polish
off
a
full
750
without
getting
sloppy
so
thats
nice
i
will
definitely
have
to
seek
out
additional
bottles
of
this
wonderful
sour
beer
from
the
bruery
the
more
i
have
their
beers
the
more
impressed
i
become
the
bruery
hottenroth
berliner
weisse
3
55
d
a
really
good
take
on
the
style
without
necessarily
trying
a
plethora
of
germanmade
examples
of
this
style
i
think
this
is
one
hell
of
an
american
stab
at
it
get
some
cheers
overall
im
bumping
this
up
because
when
mixed
with
a
fruit
beer
like
rubaeus
it
is
actually
very
nice
perhaps
a
fruit
syrup
mixed
with
this
as
in
traditional
for
the
style
would
make
this
a
more
complete
beer
strong
sour
presence
also
its
very
dry
its
as
if
someone
added
unsweetened
lemon
juice
the
aftertaste
is
lipsmackingly
tart
relatively
watery
and
the
high
carbonation
accentuates
the
thinness
overall
45
hottenroth
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
its
super
refreshing
lighter
and
has
a
nice
tart
berrycitrus
thing
going
on
it
is
a
onetrick
pony
but
as
far
as
domestic
berliner
weisses
go
its
of
very
high
qualityas
to
be
expected
from
the
bruery
good
stuff
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
refreshing
and
tasty
as
usual
the
berliner
style
is
perfect
for
the
summer
weather
would
definitely
have
again
o
its
super
hot
and
humid
tonight
so
this
is
perfect
i
love
this
style
more
and
more
with
each
example
i
try
this
one
is
world
class
as
far
as
i
can
tell
especially
for
an
american
brewer
this
particular
style
is
about
to
blow
up
its
already
popping
up
at
more
breweries
and
is
building
a
following
who
doesnt
love
a
refreshing
funky
low
abv
beer
ive
been
searching
for
this
beer
for
a
few
years
and
didnt
really
know
why
i
just
had
a
feeling
now
i
know
my
instincts
were
spoton
o
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
fun
beer
to
try
another
good
bruery
offering
o
my
second
berliner
weiss
lighter
and
more
sour
than
the
ng
version
very
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
over
all
decent
berliner
weiss
cost
7
99
for
a
750
ml
bottle
o
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
most
tart
berliner
weisses
i
have
tried
the
stickiness
at
the
end
makes
a
whole
750ml
a
little
tough
to
finish
this
is
a
fantastic
berliner
9
60
for
a
sour
that
you
can
drink
all
day
right
on
o
not
complex
very
simple
and
downright
enjoyable
to
drink
all
of
those
imposing
aromatics
arent
as
harsh
on
the
palate
as
you
might
expect
mild
citrus
with
a
gueuze
like
tartness
a
delicious
candidate
for
a
brunch
beer
a
big
10
bottle
of
berliner
weissbier
that
actually
stands
up
to
good
german
versions
flavor
and
palate
feel
are
excellent
must
try
if
you
like
the
style
probably
only
fitting
i
am
drinking
this
great
beer
on
the
official
first
day
of
summer
so
hitting
the
spot
right
now
o
this
is
crazy
enjoyable
and
at
3
1
you
could
drink
it
all
day
long
throughout
the
whole
bottle
it
doesnt
get
cloying
at
all
and
is
super
drinkable
all
the
way
through
910
would
buy
again
especially
at
the
price
overall
these
straight
berliners
suffer
from
simplicity
but
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
truly
refreshing
beer
its
easy
drinking
and
depending
on
the
price
could
be
cheaper
than
professor
fritz
1809
i
prefer
that
beer
but
for
a
bruey
beer
if
you
can
find
the
right
price
i
recommend
this
m
light
leading
to
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
only
issue
i
have
with
this
beer
and
it
is
a
small
issue
is
the
amount
of
lactic
acid
in
the
finish
i
feel
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
beer
with
low
alcohol
and
nice
big
flavor
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
overall
a
big
let
down
would
grab
new
glarus
or
bells
berliner
before
this
very
very
nice
berliner
super
refreshing
and
insanely
drinkable
but
i
guess
thats
pretty
expected
for
the
style
a
little
different
than
many
berliners
in
terms
of
the
higher
hoppage
but
its
not
enough
to
inject
unwanted
bitterness
or
distract
from
the
nice
zesty
fruits
and
soft
wheat
flavors
very
well
executed
thanks
again
to
cocoapuph
for
this
i
might
be
asking
him
for
more
pretty
soon
overall
a
really
great
refreshing
summer
beer
i
cant
stop
drinking
this
and
im
not
taking
little
sips
im
taking
full
gulps
overall
one
of
the
best
berliners
ive
had
nice
tartness
without
but
not
mouthpuckeringly
sour
extremely
refreshing
and
i
would
definitely
seek
this
out
again
the
only
drawback
is
the
price
and
the
fact
that
its
only
sold
in
large
format
bottles
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
put
in
6
packs
a
very
refreshing
classic
take
on
the
berliner
weisse
this
seems
to
be
more
to
style
than
a
lot
of
the
berliners
we
see
around
the
states
these
days
overall
perfect
for
summer
and
at
only
3
1
you
could
enjoy
this
all
day
if
you
so
desired
loved
it
this
was
a
nice
light
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
this
was
a
refreshing
light
beer
that
was
a
bit
tart
but
still
highly
drinkable
this
would
definitely
be
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
on
a
very
hot
day
overall
a
very
impressive
berliner
weiss
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
i
enjoy
it
without
any
syrup
as
the
flavor
of
the
beer
alone
is
wonderful
m
light
carbonation
tart
dryness
fantastically
dry
and
painfully
delicious
it
invites
sip
after
sip
with
a
mouth
stripping
sour
dryness
so
tart
so
delicious
its
better
than
candy
ever
could
be
its
a
sadomasochistic
dream
of
a
beer
drink
the
750ml
to
yourself
but
its
better
shared
with
friends
after
all
how
much
fun
is
sadomasochism
by
yourself
o
overall
an
incredibly
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
allows
you
to
maintain
your
sobriety
overall
this
is
my
second
or
third
berliner
weiss
and
its
the
best
ive
had
yet
super
drinkable
on
a
warm
day
like
today
if
i
could
get
this
regularly
in
the
summer
id
drink
it
all
day
especially
at
3
1
beer
is
light
in
body
with
carbonation
levels
of
high
intensity
resulting
in
a
beer
thats
fizzy
at
first
then
gradually
becoming
foamy
and
smooth
on
the
palate
rather
soda
or
champagnelike
closes
quite
dry
with
little
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
o
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
day
the
tartness
is
nice
and
the
flavors
are
light
yet
still
apparent
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
hazy
straw
color
with
an
airy
frothy
purewhite
head
sour
lemony
funk
aroma
met
with
grainy
wheat
tart
lemon
and
light
lactic
sourness
over
fresh
cereal
grain
continue
into
the
flavor
light
dry
and
puckering
mouthfeel
just
a
very
refreshing
easy
to
consume
truetostyle
berliner
quite
enjoyable
yep
o
though
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
a
3
1
berliner
weisse
i
was
at
least
looking
forward
to
a
more
lively
drink
this
is
just
a
limp
version
of
the
style
only
the
second
beer
from
the
bruery
that
i
found
to
be
less
than
great
the
other
was
white
oak
which
was
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
in
terms
of
alcohol
and
flavor
where
there
was
too
much
of
both
verdict
a
quintessential
berliner
weissbier
the
flavors
are
light
yet
impactful
and
it
has
a
great
refreshing
finish
the
simplicity
of
this
style
is
executed
wonderfully
a
really
nice
beer
to
share
with
friends
d
great
berliner
weiss
great
balance
with
good
funky
yeast
character
o
the
aroma
on
this
was
great
but
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
over
the
off
flavor
described
its
not
bad
but
not
one
of
the
better
berliner
weisses
ive
had
o
had
a
feeling
i
would
like
this
one
and
i
was
right
a
perfect
summer
beer
all
the
way
thanks
again
lance
o
overall
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
berliner
it
is
sour
and
funky
but
not
overly
in
either
direction
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
berliner
to
give
to
someone
getting
introduced
to
the
style
as
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
lightly
sourfunky
beer
without
being
overwhelming
would
like
to
have
it
again
overall
i
am
not
particularly
enthralled
with
this
beer
the
sour
twang
notes
are
a
bit
too
light
and
the
mouthfeel
could
use
a
slight
carbonation
bump
flavor
profile
was
not
too
far
from
an
undersweetened
lemonade
o
a
very
nice
berliner
weisse
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
tartness
is
spoton
in
typical
bruery
fashion
and
the
bacteria
provide
some
nice
complexity
great
stuff
overall
a
great
berliner
weiss
love
the
style
loved
this
beer
another
nice
one
bruery
i
am
not
a
seasoned
drinker
of
this
style
in
fact
this
is
only
the
third
one
i
have
had
i
reviewed
the
beer
straight
from
the
bottle
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
also
tried
one
with
both
of
the
traditional
syrups
added
waldmeister
woodruff
and
himbeer
raspberry
while
adding
these
sweet
additions
does
tend
to
make
it
more
softdrinklike
if
overdone
i
think
everyone
should
try
it
they
work
really
well
with
this
particular
beer
especially
when
you
just
add
a
dash
the
aftertaste
is
to
die
for
i
hope
to
burp
for
a
long
time
the
very
low
alcohol
is
nice
for
a
change
the
balance
is
kept
but
it
could
stand
more
malt
and
the
resultant
kick
this
is
highly
recommended
overall
very
good
nice
beer
and
the
tartness
works
well
o
very
quaffable
and
nice
complexity
for
a
3
abv
beer
very
refreshing
o
this
beer
is
not
as
sour
as
ive
heard
it
was
and
is
instead
a
tart
thirst
quencher
and
is
a
well
crafted
version
of
the
style
that
doesnt
stray
outside
of
the
lines
like
the
brusry
usually
does
picked
up
a
couple
bottles
of
this
at
provisions
yesterday
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
bruery
offerings
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
wheat
color
with
an
inch
of
white
head
refreshing
scent
of
lemon
freen
apple
and
a
nice
grainy
quality
pleasant
tartness
on
the
palate
sourness
level
is
perfect
for
my
taste
nice
wheat
character
along
with
lemons
perfect
beer
for
a
summer
day
would
love
to
see
this
distributed
in
colorado
pure
to
style
with
low
alcohol
and
nice
mix
of
tart
and
funky
flavor
really
comes
out
as
it
warms
but
i
could
see
taking
it
a
bit
colder
for
a
hot
july
afternoon
nice
beer
overall
i
wouldnt
have
minded
a
touch
more
tartness
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
dont
know
that
ive
had
a
better
american
berliner
nice
wheat
flavors
and
new
mown
grass
smells
lemon
white
pepper
lactic
acid
some
orange
zest
and
bready
into
the
finish
very
light
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
but
maybe
a
little
too
light
however
this
is
only
3
abv
a
nice
beer
one
of
the
better
berliners
ive
had
the
green
apple
gives
a
nice
contrast
to
the
normal
lemon
and
funk
wonderful
complexity
for
a
beer
barely
over
3
definitely
glad
this
one
will
be
back
soon
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
quite
awhile
back
during
a
tasting
at
his
house
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
hazy
straw
slightly
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
fresh
cut
grass
and
a
nice
hint
of
sour
apple
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
subtle
funk
and
a
nice
tart
characteristic
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
am
personally
a
big
fan
of
this
style
so
i
am
quite
picky
when
i
try
them
however
this
one
was
pretty
solid
as
far
as
berliners
go
all
of
the
right
components
are
here
for
a
solid
brew
but
i
just
wish
they
were
a
little
more
intense
than
they
were
this
did
make
it
easier
for
the
novice
to
the
style
to
drink
but
as
someone
who
appreciates
the
style
it
was
a
little
on
the
weak
side
still
a
very
solid
brew
that
i
wish
i
would
have
gotten
many
more
of
this
is
a
good
example
for
the
style
the
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
funk
work
really
well
with
white
meat
or
on
its
own
i
can
see
picking
this
up
for
a
summer
evening
i
hope
to
have
both
again
soon
poured
out
as
a
bright
yellowish
color
with
a
touch
of
haze
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
wheat
and
what
could
have
been
lime
the
beer
smelled
sour
for
the
most
part
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
light
but
has
a
pretty
good
amount
of
sour
flavors
in
it
to
make
you
wanna
pucker
a
little
bit
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
fairly
refreshing
overall
this
beer
was
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
be
in
my
opinion
overall
a
good
berliner
weisse
that
always
works
when
i
want
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
i
need
to
pick
this
up
more
often
o
at
first
i
hated
it
in
sipping
more
i
found
it
to
be
more
and
more
wonderful
strange
beer
would
try
again
for
sure
light
in
body
easy
to
drink
not
quite
as
tartsour
as
i
was
hoping
but
thats
just
me
subtle
lemon
tartness
very
light
without
being
thin
or
watery
well
done
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
b
skål
o
best
berliner
weiss
ive
had
to
date
great
balance
and
flavor
profile
also
extremely
sessionable
after
extolling
the
virtues
of
this
style
to
a
customer
earlier
i
figured
id
try
out
a
new
bweiss
myself
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
shortlived
couple
o
fingers
o
fizzy
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
lemon
zest
sour
yeast
yeah
its
bacteria
but
for
some
reason
saying
sour
bacteria
doesnt
sound
right
in
my
head
and
light
wet
wheat
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
tartness
really
blooming
right
up
front
this
is
shortlived
though
as
things
die
away
completely
just
after
the
midway
point
leaving
a
very
dry
and
empty
tongue
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
bweiss
but
one
that
ultimately
leaves
me
wanting
in
some
vague
sense
i
cant
explain
it
its
still
good
just
not
as
good
as
it
probably
could
be
i
think
o
i
like
this
one
alot
but
just
wish
it
was
at
least
around
5
that
being
said
this
would
be
a
nice
one
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
md
puckering
wish
i
had
some
of
the
syrup
the
bottle
suggests
to
try
definitely
quality
regardless
but
like
most
sours
you
have
reeeaaaally
like
sours
overall
very
tasty
the
best
light
beer
ive
ever
had
very
complex
very
drinkable
meh
not
the
best
bruery
beer
out
there
o
well
this
is
the
4th
berliner
weiss
ive
tried
and
probably
second
only
to
the
fritz
briem
berliner
weiss
this
is
a
fascinating
beer
that
comes
from
a
fascinating
style
that
is
in
need
of
more
accessibility
hopefully
more
breweries
will
start
to
brew
berliner
weissbiers
this
was
a
solid
beer
for
me
one
i
would
purchase
again
in
the
future
but
hopefully
will
find
it
fresh
o
between
berliner
weiss
and
gose
two
hard
to
find
styles
in
mainly
by
different
brewers
yet
are
my
favorites
mouthfeeloverall
lack
of
acid
makes
it
pretty
wet
in
the
mouth
thin
body
and
thin
carbonation
still
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
my
ideal
for
the
style
and
you
wont
hear
me
complaining
about
3
1
alcohol
by
volume
what
a
gift
do
effortlessly
drinkable
the
strong
wheat
component
here
is
unexpected
in
such
a
lowgravity
beer
but
definitely
compelling
it
is
a
strange
sour
fresh
rather
than
woody
or
musty
as
is
typical
for
various
other
styles
possibly
with
potential
as
a
gateway
while
remarkably
clean
a
word
of
warning
is
in
order
do
not
follow
other
beers
with
this
one
unless
you
like
your
sour
beer
to
taste
like
stomach
acid
overall
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresher
version
but
for
a
rare
style
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
a
wonderful
berliner
weiss
id
love
to
have
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
poured
a
whiteish
and
hazy
straw
yellow
good
sized
white
head
sits
atop
a
heavy
film
of
head
is
retained
nose
has
straight
lemons
wheat
and
a
bit
of
funk
uncomplicated
distinct
and
to
the
point
taste
is
tart
through
and
through
lemons
with
some
light
wheat
and
breadiness
on
the
backend
puckering
finish
and
a
relatively
quick
mouthfeel
very
light
body
very
drinkable
and
the
best
berliner
ive
come
across
in
some
time
extremely
quenching
and
one
where
i
wouldve
love
to
have
tried
the
blueberry
and
raspberry
variationsmaybe
with
some
woodruff
syrup
too
if
available
incredibly
drinkable
a
very
light
easy
drinking
beer
the
mild
sourness
adds
some
nice
character
to
the
subtle
wheat
notes
hazy
pale
golden
colour
light
white

subtle
lacing
smell
is
funky
tart
lemons

and
pretty
yeasty
taste

very
nice
high
prickly
carbonation
you
can
feel
all
across
the
tongue
good
feel
nice
weight
very
nice
stuff
here
very
drinkable
i
think
we
knocked
off
the
bottle
in
about
34
minutes
would
welcome
again
gladly
notes
solid
mildly
tart
and
a
little
funky
glad
i
have
a
second
bottle
coming
from
darthkostritzer
so
i
can
see
a
little
more
development
wonderful
drinkability
if
sour
or
tart
is
in
your
repertoire
cloudy
yellow
with
a
big
soapy

funky
lemony
yeast
aroma
smooth
mouthfeel
despite
tartness
drying
finish
hits
the
bullseye
lots
of
flavour
for
very
low
abv
sessionable
great
by
itself
or
with
food
light
bodied
but
i
think
filling
from
the
heavy
carbonation
still
wife
and
i
will
have
no
problem
downing
this
750
overall
a
better
beer
than
my
review
likely
indicates
i
wouldnt
want
this
on
a
cold
winter
day
but
a
fantasticly
refreshing
summer
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
whitewinelike
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
disappears
slowly
scent
is
tart
lemon
with
some
wheat
and
grain
in
the
nose
nice
citrus
aromas
with
bright
tart
fruit
notes
taste
is
initially
like
a
very
light
wheat
beer
that
lacks
in
all
the
clove
and
coriander
flavors
which
is
a
good
thing
and
is
replaced
by
tart
lemon
and
citrus
notes
pleasant
yeast
flavors
make
the
tart
flavors
more
mellow
than
they
want
to
be
finishes
with
lovely
lemon
and
wheat
flavors
mouthfeel
is
extremely
light
and
airy
perfect
for
this
style
in
beer
drinkability
is
extremely
high
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
that
represents
this
style
to
a
tee
with
such
low
abv
and
such
high
drinkability
this
beer
is
perfect
for
session
drinking
and
hot
summer
daysnights
ontap
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
smells
of
sour
candy
hops
lemon
and
wheat
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
lemon
peal
wheat
and
a
very
strong
tart
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
light
good
carbonation
and
good
balance
of
smoothness
with
the
tartness
this
is
one
of
the
few
berliner
weisse
beers
i
have
had
and
it
has
convinced
me
to
explore
the
style
deeper
overall
exemplary
refreshing
a
delightful
burst
of
refreshment
only
gripe
is
i
wish
i
had
about
30
more
bottles
of
this
nectar
mouthfeel
and
taste
very
light
bodied
crisp
and
tingly
carbonation
matches
with
subtle
acidity
for
a
very
refreshing
flavour
lemony
minerally
and
quite
dry
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
very
much
delicious
nice
bottle
aroma
lots
of
funk
white
wine
cat
piss
lemon
weird
but
nice
appearance
milky
yellow
with
small
head
its
far
from
cute
but
it
is
so
unusual
i
kinda
like
it
taste
packed
with
flavors
i
cant
believe
it
lots
of
lemon
brett
this
is
very
dry
and
very
tart
i
love
it
palate
dry
thin
overall
this
is
the
more
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
ive
ever
had
this
3
berliner
weisse
couldnt
have
been
better
executed
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
tag
and
availabilty
thatd
be
my
go
to
summer
beer
best
surprise
in
a
long
time
tart
with
a
refreshing
lemon
zing
the
wick
of
lactic
sour
lit
in
my
mouth
the
head
of
the
beer
is
so
sexy
it
pours
sparkles
away
you
can
hear
the
head
dissipate
into
the
air
a
mystic
wonder
this
is
an
excellent
version
of
it
alcohol
content
spot
on
the
true
working
class
beer
in
spite
of
the
talent
and
patience
it
must
take
to
make
cheers
to
the
rue
in
all
of
you
poured
a
light
yellow
and
a
bit
fizzy
slightly
hazy
this
had
the
best
aroma
of
any
weisse
ive
had
with
a
more
fruity
aroma
as
opposed
to
a
lactic
spoiled
milk
smell
ive
noticed
in
some
other
berliners
tart
enough
for
the
style
but
certainly
not
mouthpuckering
sour
very
light
in
body
with
a
dry
finish
which
normally
would
make
a
beer
very
quaffable
but
the
sour
character
actually
had
me
sipping
this
beer
the
very
low
alcohol
content
made
this
very
refreshing
after
moving
some
furniture
absolutely
spectacular
representation
of
the
style
certainly
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
tried
this
brewing
masterpiece
o
im
not
too
used
or
into
this
vicinity
of
style
but
i
actually
found
this
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
it
would
actually
be
interesting
to
try
these
with
some
of
the
recommended
syrups
if
lighter
german
styles
are
your
thing
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
you
wont
love
this
o
a
nice
brew
very
refreshing
it
comes
off
a
bit
mellow
on
the
palate
but
maybe
thats
why
the
style
invites
the
addition
of
syrups
i
was
more
than
happy
to
enjoy
it
plain
and
i
got
a
real
sense
of
the
subtly
lagerchampagne
fusion
enjoyment
of
this
brew
is
highly
contextual
for
me
in
a
warm
climate
i
can
see
this
being
a
very
enticing
alternative
to
a
great
many
ales
id
grab
a
bottle
or
two
for
a
nonbeerdrinker
get
together
and
enjoy
my
craft
beer
without
sticking
out
like
a
sore
thumb
points
for
refreshing
points
for
craft
but
im
not
sure
how
true
this
is
to
the
style
im
very
curious
to
try
more
in
style
now
good
beer
for
what
it
is
but
if
you
arent
in
a
warm
climate
this
might
come
off
a
bit
strange
o
i
love
a
great
berliner
weisse
and
this
is
one
of
them
i
just
wish
it
were
a
little
more
affordable
overall
ive
said
from
time
to
time
that
although
i
love
craft
beer
i
still
think
a
light
american
lager
is
the
most
refreshing
beer
during
the
summer
well
im
eating
my
words
big
time
with
this
one
highly
sessionable
and
highly
recommended
i
just
wish
it
were
more
readily
available
o
yeah
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
the
first
time
i
tried
it
no
one
could
get
past
one
sip
this
is
slightly
better
but
not
by
much
incredibly
disheartening
overall
very
drinkable
and
tasty
in
the
summertime
well
brewed
beer
pours
a
murky
white
wine
color
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
whatsoever
smells
of
wheat
and
sour
lactic
notes
taste
is
of
mild
wheat
with
a
nice
sour
puckering
quality
a
high
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasting
good
beer
but
the
appearance
and
smell
are
not
that
good
with
a
low
abv
this
is
a
beer
you
could
easily
drink
all
night
ive
had
better
low
abv
beers
the
alchemists
shut
the
hell
up
comes
to
mind
overall
i
could
imagine
drinking
a
couple
glasses
of
this
outside
in
the
heat
but
the
price
is
a
turnoff
i
feel
like
i
am
paying
for
the
bottle
and
that
the
presentation
works
against
this
particular
bruery
beer
a
46pack
would
be
prefered
pour
is
as
expected
yellow
top
of
the
bottle
is
clear
bottom
is
a
bit
of
cloudiness
not
much
after
brewing
these
im
come
across
two
different
types
of
berliner
the
low
fg
dry
this
dryness
working
as
the
backbone
of
the
palate
and
the
thicker
wheat
core
with
a
sour
twist
this
is
the
first
quite
filtered
lack
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
weak
protein
formation
nose
of
lemon
grass
and
yogart
zesty
palate
is
lacto
also
salty
the
perfect
bbq
beer
when
without
fruit
syrup
i
can
see
it
cutting
sweetness
wonderfully
palate
of
yogart
hints
and
minimal
wheat
intense
tart
dryness
but
not
offensive
a
quick
finish
a
bit
of
lemon
pulp
and
teeth
grinding
a
novelity
of
sort
but
sours
are
in
so
it
works
in
the
end
a
tad
heavy
for
the
aby
but
good
to
see
people
are
making
a
style
i
like
cant
wait
to
have
mine
flavor
has
a
bit
of
grape
sweetness
as
well
before
the
wave
of
dry
tart
crabapple
crispness
blasts
the
palate
very
dry
and
effervescent
clean
and
simple
aftertaste
of
grain
and
a
hint
of
clean
wild
yeast
very
quenching
easily
sipped
or
gulped
pairs
well
with
food
or
as
an
apertif
to
whet
the
appetite
if
you
know
someone
who
likes
dry
champagne
offer
them
this
its
no
coincidence
this
is
known
as
the
champagne
of
the
north
like
a
previous
review
not
sure
the
bottle
was
quite
worth
the
810
price
tag
lighter
body
higher
carbonation
tingly
and
refreshing
on
the
senses
i
could
probably
take
down
an
entire
bottle
of
this
without
much
effort
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
at
the
same
time
add
in
that
this
is
3
1
and
youve
got
a
winner
especially
if
you
like
berliner
weiss
bruery
hottenroth
is
probably
the
palest
beer
ive
ever
hadprobably
1
srm
if
that
its
lighter
in
color
than
lemonade
and
the
first
pour
is
almost
crystal
clear
whereas
the
second
is
hazier
the
beer
foams
up
with
a
thick
white
head
that
quickly
fizzes
out
the
beer
smells
a
little
funky
sour
not
entirely
like
an
american
wild
but
like
spoiled
milk
and
a
little
lemony
it
also
smells
a
bit
doughy
the
beer
is
tart
upfront
with
good
round
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
sour
this
is
not
a
very
complex
beer
pretty
bland
sour
with
a
little
lemony
bite
and
a
clean
aftertaste
one
of
the
better
versions
of
this
somewhat
elusive
style
for
me
most
are
simply
not
tart
or
lactic
enough
this
one
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
an
almost
greenish
cast
finely
beaded
pure
white
head
smells
soft
and
slightly
grainy
with
an
almost
barnyard
note
as
well
some
lactic
tartness
particularly
at
the
end
the
taste
is
much
more
lactic
and
tart
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
nice
lemony
sourness
almost
cutting
at
first
and
then
turning
more
into
a
lemon
peel
bitterness
with
some
lemon
juiciness
hanging
in
there
a
touch
of
lactic
tanginess
not
quite
creamy
makes
a
brief
appearance
really
nice
beer
o
berliner
weisse
beers
put
drinkability
above
all
else
and
hottenroth
is
no
exception
i
love
its
big
flavor
and
low
abv
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
evening
o
this
is
a
very
tart
and
sour
beer
mouth
puckering
sour
and
delicious
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
sours
i
can
see
me
getting
beer
quite
a
few
more
times
the
dryness
acidity
and
some
of
the
taste
remind
me
very
much
of
white
wine
t
very
light
but
has
a
great
taste
lemon
tart
green
apple
vinegar
and
a
touch
of
baby
aspirin
tart
but
not
exactly
sour
like
it
restrains
itself
before
it
gets
so
sour
that
it
makes
you
pucker
up
a
great
take
on
the
style
and
the
perfect
summer
beer
the
only
thing
i
complain
is
the
price
my
bottle
says
1350
which
is
920
in
my
eyes
far
too
expensive
for
such
a
beer
its
a
good
beer
but
here
in
europe
you
wont
even
sell
it
for
half
of
it
o
quite
nice
berliner
weissbier
i
can
see
how
its
highly
rated
easy
drinking
good
flavors
and
some
nice
tartness
overall
dont
look
for
this
one
to
blow
you
away
with
appearance
smell
or
taste
but
it
is
fantastic
to
the
style
perfect
thing
for
a
hot
day
especially
with
the
3
1
abv
you
can
drink
these
all
day
if
you
can
afford
it
will
definitely
buy
some
more
and
share
them
with
the
non
craft
crowd
see
if
i
can
sway
a
few
overall
my
first
of
this
style
this
is
exceptionally
like
the
ba
description
a
fantastic
beer
ill
enjoy
this
often
over
this
summer
absolutely
fantastic
d
not
bad
for
a
summer
sipper
pours
a
pale
clear
yellowsilver
with
a
lively
head
that
leaves
quickly
without
a
trace
looks
like
champagne
and
the
carbonation
is
right
on
par
with
that
too
the
nose
is
subtle
with
a
slightly
sour
vinous
quality
along
with
cherry
and
a
touch
of
earth
along
with
a
funky
minerality
the
taste
is
spot
on
champagne
dry
nice
acidity
chalky
with
a
slight
sourness
and
almost
a
french
terrior
of
minerals
and
earth
very
good
to
drink
just
not
a
fan
if
its
considered
a
beer
as
it
could
trick
most
into
being
champagne
and
though
i
like
it
to
style
its
just
not
there
this
is
a
wheat
beer
so
someone
correct
me
if
im
wrong
but
i
dont
worry
about
the
sediment
in
this
one
as
much
pours
a
slightly
hazy
glowing
whitegold
with
a
white
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
and
manages
to
leave
little
bits
of
lace
lots
of
lemon
on
the
nose
as
well
as
a
good
deal
of
almost
salty
minerality
some
haywheat
a
touch
of
funk
and
fruit
pear
skin
taste
is
just
barely
tart
lemon
rind
hits
right
away
but
everything
is
extremely
wellbalanced
and
works
together
fantastically
well
soft
light
and
zippy
mouthfeel
very
clean
with
no
aftertaste
overall
a
welldone
refresher
that
makes
for
great
summertime
schwill
always
happy
when
this
comes
out
god
bless
bruery
im
newly
infatuated
with
this
style
and
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
really
very
refreshing
and
light
and
quaffable
my
favorite
from
the
bruerys
regular
lineup
ill
be
sipping
these
all
summer
o
nice
beer
on
a
warm
sunny
day
easy
to
sip
quite
sessionable
were
it
not
a
bit
on
the
pricy
side
i
like
this
on
its
own
and
i
dont
find
it
necessary
to
add
flavored
syrup
it
is
a
perfect
choice
when
you
want
a
low
alcohol
yet
very
refreshing
beer
d
excellent
this
is
my
favorite
berliner
weisse
the
nose
is
a
little
off
but
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
after
reviewing
half
a
bottle
with
a
few
friends
we
poured
a
second
round
to
try
it
berlinerstyle
with
flavored
syrup
the
best
was
a
jerryrigged
apricot
syrup
made
from
apricot
jam
brown
sugar
and
enough
water
to
redissolve
the
pectin
and
thin
it
out
the
juicy
and
lightly
tart
apricot
flavor
paired
exceptionally
well
with
the
bright
lemoncitrus
of
the
beer
d
pretty
good
berliner
nice
tart
character
mixed
with
the
citrus
i
wish
the
nose
would
have
been
a
littler
more
interesting
solid
nonetheless
dits
definitely
an
easy
drinker
but
the
taste
isnt
exactly
something
i
want
a
whole
lot
of
the
corn
flavor
isnt
very
desirable
to
me
overall
theres
not
a
great
deal
to
be
said
since
it
as
a
style
is
not
that
complicated
i
do
like
that
there
is
the
brett
funk
thats
thrown
in
to
give
it
a
bit
more
complexity
than
it
might
otherwise
have
its
pretty
refreshing
has
to
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
in
terms
of
style
this
is
really
great
it
has
a
ridiculous
drinkability
due
to
the
mellow
abv
and
smooth
mouthfeel
all
the
while
having
a
great
sour
bite
to
fulfill
any
sour
heads
desire
at
least
temporarily
this
bottle
did
not
last
long
i
would
not
mind
getting
a
case
of
this
for
the
summertime
super
refreshing
ddidnt
really
do
it
for
me
might
just
be
how
this
style
is
but
this
mostly
tasted
like
water
with
lemon
juice
squeezed
into
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
much
flavor
or
a
very
desireable
flavor
at
that
will
try
others
of
the
same
style
but
prob
wont
get
this
one
again
drinkability
is
fantastic
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
but
wanted
to
save
my
moneyalcohol
intake
for
pty
hottenroth
is
one
of
the
bruerys
better
efforts
and
is
almost
as
good
as
the
best
berliner
weissbiers
to
have
ever
entered
my
glass
professor
fritz
briem
1809
and
dfh
festina
peche
bottom
line
traditional
berliner
weiss
with
a
wild
ale
twist
that
works
definitely
belgianesque
very
interesting
for
its
style
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
snow
white
foam
smells
of
sweet
esters
and
lemon
rind
the
taste
is
lemon
zest
sweet
esters
and
chardonnay
very
nice
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
im
really
enjoying
this
one
its
very
refreshing
and
the
white
wine
characteristics
that
im
getting
lend
a
complexity
to
the
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
great
on
a
cold
rainy
winter
one
today
ill
be
seeking
this
out
in
the
future
d
pretty
decent
berliner
weiss
brew
that
was
drinking
good
with
a
good
amount
of
tart
character
the
cpj
tart
sour
snappy
crisp
this
would
be
a
great
summertime
brew
especially
coming
in
at
3
1
this
beer
is
light
in
feel
there
is
a
rather
low
abv
but
has
a
well
craft
flavor
profile
that
also
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
with
little
effort
or
afterthought
d
i
think
i
am
going
to
down
the
entire
750
by
myself
this
is
one
fantastic
brew
and
will
get
it
again
for
sure
d
extremely
drinkable
its
light
and
enjoyable
its
kind
of
a
mixed
bag
overall
for
me
but
all
in
all
im
glad
i
tried
it
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
pure
white
head
with
good
retention
and
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
sour
and
tart
notes
are
very
well
balanced
with
solid
malt
notes
taste
is
dominated
by
tart
notes
thought
not
overwhelming
with
great
notes
of
malt
and
no
acidity
notes
body
is
full
for
style
with
good
carbonation
very
refreshing
with
great
drinkability
factor
probably
one
of
the
bets
beer
i
tasted
from
this
brewery
with
great
balance
and
refreshing
factor
edit2
had
a
growler
of
it
on
memorial
day
while
4wheeling
and
cave
spelunking
just
awesome
this
beer
keeps
rising
d
an
outstanding
example
of
one
of
the
most
fascinating
styles
of
brew
i
highly
recommend
this
to
any
fan
of
sour
brews
as
it
is
quite
delicious
drink
i
finished
the
bottle
if
all
sours
are
like
this
then
i
dont
think
they
are
for
me
drinkable
but
i
didnt
order
a
second
berliner
weisse
production
notes
mashed
hops
into
grain
hops
not
boiled
will
impede
the
pedicocci
and
lactobacillus
which
imparts
flavors
to
this
sour
wheat
beer
50
wheat
popular
in
the
19th
century
napoleon
liked
it
germans
cut
it
with
syrup
raspberry
overall
one
would
expect
any
3
1
abv
beer
to
be
easy
to
drink
but
this
beer
combines
the
crisp
sharpness
of
the
carbonation
and
the
sour
tartness
to
provide
great
drinkability
regardless
of
abv
the
taste
is
lightly
tart
with
a
nice
wheat
base
some
lighter
stone
fruits
and
green
apple
come
through
with
a
bit
of
sourness
light
mouthfeel
with
very
nice
sourness
levels
and
a
good
overall
carbonation
base
drinks
incredibly
well
either
plain
or
with
the
woodruff
d
at
just
above
3
this
is
about
as
sessionable
as
they
get
great
taste
and
really
thirstquenching
i
feel
like
i
could
never
get
enough
of
this
solid
representation
of
a
great
style
do
beers
get
any
easier
to
drink
than
this
i
think
not
another
top
score
it
is
55
this
is
my
first
beer
from
the
bruery
and
id
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
awhile
despite
the
low
abv
it
poured
a
very
carbonated
and
crisp
pale
pale
straw
yellow
in
color
with
a
great
deal
of
white
quickly
dissipating
foam
it
looks
like
pear
juice
or
watered
down
apple
juice
and
is
very
light
in
color
the
only
thing
i
can
really
smell
is
the
sourness
and
tartness
of
a
good
berliner
weiss
the
taste
is
excellent
it
reminds
me
of
a
sour
light
apple
or
pear
cider
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
very
very
crisp
due
to
good
carbonation
i
find
this
to
be
insanely
drinkable
probably
because
its
only
3
1
the
only
drawback
is
the
price
of
9
99
for
a
low
abv
beer
but
otherwise
its
definitely
worth
trying
overall
a
very
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderately
high
level
of
carbonation
that
fits
the
style
overall
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
think
there
are
a
few
others
out
there
which
are
a
bit
better
value
for
the
money

d
overall
pretty
mediocre
but
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
brings
up
the
drinkability
quite
a
bit
if
at
all
possible
this
must
be
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
bruery
i
think
it
can
also
be
found
at
stone
on
tap
i
like
sours
and
i
still
didnt
like
this
one
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
or
it
is
a
little
too
intense
for
me
picked
up
a
bottle
on
my
way
back
from
the
beach
over
the
weekend
cracked
it
open
before
dinner
tonight
poured
a
pale
hazy
straw
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
ultra
white
head
that
fizzed
down
pretty
quick
leaving
no
lace
smells
of
light
grains
wheat
with
some
tart
lemon
zest
taste
is
nice
and
wheaty
with
some
nice
lactic
tartness
again
lemon
and
sour
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
nice
carbonation
level
with
a
nice
tart
zing
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
d
this
is
a
good
brew
but
simple
too
tart
to
get
a
really
high
drinkablity
score
saying
that
berliner
weisses
are
drinkable
is
obvious
but
this
one
is
particularly
downable
and
its
fun
to
take
the
ride
from
sour
bite
to
wheaty
coat
i
also
love
the
low
abv
which
will
allow
for
a
full
day
of
sober
sipping
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
grapefruit
like
color
with
a
tiny
bubble
white
head
the
arome
is
funk
wheat
with
a
slight
touch
of
citric
notes
also
reminds
me
slightly
of
a
belgian
the
first
sip
is
tart
and
sour
that
transitions
to
a
wheat
beer
aftertaste
not
overly
sour
by
any
means
slightly
acidic
at
only
3

you
dont
pick
up
the
alcohol
notes
at
all

great

time
low
abv
beer
interested
to
see
how
this
will
be
with
a
year
down
in
the
cellar
here
is
a
beer
that
i
think
people
have
a
hard
time

without
the
proper
exposure
to
the
style
having
tried
about
7
different
berliner
weisse
brews
from
commercial
breweries
and
many
many
homebrew
attempts
i
think
this
beer
is
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
the
smell
is
clean
with
a
touch
of
wheatgrain
yet
you
still
get
that
touch
of
lacto
vinegar
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
well
rounded
and
features
citric
acid
and
light
grains
it
is
the
perfect
level
of
sour
and
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
i
love
this
beer
and
could
drink
it
all
day
the
only
part
that
isnt
perfect
is
the
head
which
didnt
seem
to
last
long
but
who
cares
about
that
with
a
stellar
berliner
like
this
all
in
all
this
is
probably
the
single
most
refreshing
beer
ive
ever
consumed
my
first
of
the
style
so
i
dont
have
much
of
a
baseline
for
rating
but
its
hard
to
imagine
a
berliner
weiss
that
can
be
much
better
than
hottenroth
being
light
nice
and
tart
not
heavy
at
all
not
really
sweet
some
nice
toasty
malts
and
wheat
nice
raspberry
and
the
nice
toasty
barnyard
funk
not
brett
funk
a
special
belgian
yeast
great
mouth
feel
and
drink
ability
extremely
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
just
a
flat
out
tasty
beer
wish
i
still
lived
close
enough
for
growler
fills
light
body
spritzy
carbonation
is
there
really
alcohol
in
here
very
refreshing
with
a
bit
of
complexity
very
well
made
this
is
the
first
time
ive
spent
8
on
a
3
1
beer
abv
does
not
always
equal
flavor
berliner
weisse
is
a
style
that
will
really
make
one
reconsider
lower
abv
brews
especially
when
youre
tired
of
big
sweet
flavor
bombs
the
hottenroth
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
fizzy
2
finger
head
and
minimal
retention
very
brilliant
looking
pour
nose
is
very
citrusy
and
some
bananas
wheat
is
noticeable
as
well
as
some
funk
taste
is
sour
from
lemony
tastes
also
yeast
is
pronounced
on
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
well
carbonated
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
i
am
digging
this
style
d
this
is
an
awesome
beer
with
a
damn
good
sour
taste
at
a
super
sessionable
abv
making
it
easy
to
drink
the
750
on
your
own
worth
hunting
down
to
try
sometime
poured
a
lovely
light
straw
yellow
slightly
hazy
as
its
supposed
to
be
with
a
1
white
short
lived
head
very
nicely
tart
and
citrusy
in
the
aroma
hint
of
biscuit
and
a
pronounced
wheat
twang
flavor
is
a
touch
more
complex
than
expected
lemony
tart
touch
of
yeast
puckering
finish
with
a
layer
of
barnyard
funk
but
this
is
almost
hidden
crisp
and
light
this
beer
is
best
served
chilled
slightly
above
refrigeration
temperature
in
a
flute
or
a
weizen
glass
outstanding
beer
perfect
for
florida
weather
you
better
enjoy
sour
tart
things
before
you
tackle
this
bottle
because
its
a
large
one
i
will
be
sharing
the
rest
with
my
wife
who
always
enjoys
when
i
break
out
a
sour
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
even
better
it
was
just
perfect
for
this
hot
day
i
will
chalk
up
another
win
for
the
bruery
and
their
beers
they
always
seem
to
impress
me
since
this
is
a
rarely
made
st
lye
of
beer
i
would
definitely
say
you
should
give
it
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
just
for
the
experience
it
was
sour
tart
winy
and
refreshing
and
should
not
be
overseen
when
you
go
looking
for
a
great
summer
beer
d
definitely
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
dont
be
a
sissy
and
drink
it
with
syrup
though
poured
with
a
fine
white
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
very
pale
yellow
aroma
is
tart
and
a
bit
of
funky
barnyard
flavor
is
tart
forward
with
hints
of
berries
and
lemon
plus
some
grass
body
is
a
little
more
soft
than
a
couple
of
the
german
versions
ive
had
carbonation
is
good
finish
is
good
fairly
clean
and
on
the
short
side
with
woodruff
syrup
very
good
too
d
this
was
a
very
tart
beer
but
not
in
the
same
way
as
a
wild
ale
or
lambic
it
was
interesting
to
try
and
i
could
certainly
understand
why
its
traditionally
drunk
with
fruit
syrup
added
recommended
only
for
experimentation
purposes
or
if
youre
a
huge
fan
of
this
unique
style
as
it
seems
to
be
a
good
representation
drinkability
though
i
am
a
little
disappointed
in
the
fading
carbonation
keep
the
pours
small
to
preserve
the
bubbles
this
is
a
refreshingly
tart
summertime
drink
got
a
bottle
of
this
as
a
gift
from
a
friend
and
just
opened
it
today
very
light
straw
color
and
very
cloudy
very
light
head
in
color
and
amount
flavor
is
typical
for
a
berlinerweiss
good
sourness
with
a
slight
bready
character
aroma
is
very
good
a
little
fruity
i
love
everything
ive
had
from
this
brewery
drinkability
man
this
is
an
excellent
summertime
brew
that
really
really
is
refreshing
the
bruery
i
thank
you
and
ding
im
a
fan
of
berliner
weisse
beers
just
not
this
one
i
was
really
hoping
it
was
just
me
this
beer
just
seems
to
be
lacking
in
content
to
me
d
very
tart
and
refreshing
perfect
on
a
hot
day
i
threw
back
a
couple
of
these
one
day
while
painting
my
kitchen
definitely
helped
make
it
bearable
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
a
fairly
uncommon
beer
style
that
i
love
to
introduce
nonbeer
drinkers
to
berliner
weisse
is
probably
one
of
those
loveitorhateit
styles
im
a
big
fan
and
dont
see
many
examples
of
the
style
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
thanks
to
blake
for
the
bottle
exceptionally
well
balanced
lemony
tartness
enough
to
be
pleasantly
tangy
but
not
mouthpuckeringly
sour
like
some
lemon
and
clean
grain
notes
great
hot
weather
quencher
and
as
per
the
style
low
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
hard
to
imagine
a
more
drinkable
beer
very
well
done
im
going
to
have
to
find
some
woodruff
syrup
the
next
time
i
try
this
style
d
this
is
a
great
hot
weather
beer
easy
to
pound
away
while
sitting
on
the
deck
great
stuff
d
if
you
like
sourness
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
although
you
could
add
some
fruit
syrup
to
make
it
a
little
more
palate
the
beer
is
very
light
and
refreshing
overall
this
beer
was
an
excellent
departure
from
what
i
usually
drink
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
great
beer
recommended
drinkability
very
good
for
the
style
and
my
favorite
from
the
bruery
i
could
sip
on
this
all
day
not
a
starter
sour
but
more
of
a
medium
one
wish
i
could
find
this
more
easily
d
i
wouldnt
drink
these
all
the
time
but
this
was
just
what
i
was
looking
for
today
tart
refreshing
and
cool
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
i
must
admit
these
would
not
be
very
sessionable
for
me
due
to
its
sour
nature
but
still
a
good
beer
nonetheless
the
finish
is
nice
and
dry
drank
the
glass
before
i
even
realized
it
drinkability
so
many
people
in
the
craft
beer
community
rail
against
beers
they
call
fizzy
yellow
water
this
is
fizzy
yellow
and
about
as
close
to
the
feel
of
water
as
youre
likely
to
find
in
a
beer
and
its
great
delicious
refreshing
and
very
unique
it
was
worth
the
effort
it
took
me
to
track
it
down
d
super
quaffable
super
refreshing
drink
it
straight
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
definitely
covet
a
750ml
bottle
for
myself
in
a
sitting
its
a
very
refreshing
and
easytodrink
beer
sour
fans
seeks
this
one
out
dbig
flavors
and
very
light
body
easy
session
beer
but
the
tartness
makes
me
not
want
to
keep
drinking
it
d
a
drinkable
if
somewhat
odd
beer
d
like
most
berliner
weissbiers
hottenroth
is
low
in
alcohol
and
long
on
tartness
at
least
for
a
spell

a

very

otherwise
a
fine
offering
for
a
style
we
see
rarely
here
in
the
us
d
really
drinkable
as
far
as
abv
goes
but
turns
into
a
sipper
due
to
sweet
and
tartness
of
it
enjoyed
on
a
sunny
day
and
seems
nice
for
such
a
setting
probably
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
i
have
had
at
roughly
3
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
i
would
love
to
have
a
growler
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
on
the
golf
course
amazing
brew
for
sure
simply
a
must
try
update
starting
to
love
this
style
and
this
beer
re
rate
i
will
note
that
i
was
drinking
out
of
my
tulip
while
my
girlfriend
was
drinking
out
of
a
regular
glass
and
the
difference
was
noteworthy
the
appearance
and
taste
were
noticable
the
taste
has
a
bracing
sourness
up
front
when
its
cold
but
subsides
and
smoothes
out
as
it
warms
its
crisp
and
lemony
not
very
complex
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
this
is
an
after
work
hot
day
slammer
and
it
does
a
great
job
of
that
the
body
is
very
light
with
such
a
high
carbonation
which
makes
this
the
ultimate
summer
refreshment
i
dont
have
a
huge
familiarity
with
this
style
but
this
one
hits
all
the
notes
for
me
d
a
solid
berliner
weissebier
but
a
slightly
muted
and
subdued
version
doesnt
pack
the
flavor
or
potency
that
i
was
expected
easy
drinking
and
still
highly
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
memorable
not
super
complex
kind
of
relies
on
2
notes
but
interesting
nonetheless
good
but
challenging
ones
enough
for
an
evening
drinkability
is
great
light
well
balanced
and
super
drinkable
a
great
refreshing
summer
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
very
refreshing
i
need
to
do
one
of
these
for
home
great
berliner
thanks
mike
sharply
tart
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
without
a
lot
of
unpleasant
souring
character
this
was
a
rather
good
take
on
a
berlinerwiess
i
believe
that
i
actually
enjoyed
this
a
bit
more
in
the
bottle
than
i
did
on
tap
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
crisp
with
tiny
carbonation
nice
i
think
this
is
my
first
berliner
weiss
overall
i
am
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
it
has
encouraged
me
to
seek
out
other
similar
beers
i
feel
like
this
would
be
an
excellent
warm
weather
beer
and
would
pair
up
wonderfully
with
light
salads
fruit
and
grilled
chicken
and
seafood
this
beer
is
sour
but
it
lacks
the
intense
sourness
that
would
slow
you
down
if
you
were
drinking
a
wild
ale
combine
that
with
a
balancing
wheat
flavor
and
a
very
low
abv
and
the
bruery
has
put
together
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
d
this
is
a
great
berliner
its
tart
but
it
has
a
good
yeastiness
to
back
it
up
the
body
is
goodbut
a
hair
thinwhich
is
to
be
expected
in
a
brew
that
is
3
1
abv
well
done
overall
by
the
bruery
excellent
huge
thanks
to
viggo
for
bringing
this
to
the
epic
bruery
tasting
perhaps
my
most
anticipated
beer
and
it
wasnt
a
letdown
d
great
drinkability
this
a
beer
that
is
not
overpowering
but
has
great
very
subtle
flavor
it
seems
like
a
great
springsummer
beer
to
sip
on
on
a
nice
evening
it
has
a
nice
amount
of
sour
but
is
not
overwhelming
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
a
night
which
i
think
it
great
super
drinkable
i
wish
more
people
were
making
this
style
the
top
part
of
the
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
straw
colour
with
a
shortlived
fizzy
white
cap
smells
a
bit
sour
wet
hay
faint
tart
berries
fruity
as
it
warms
light
and
tart
in
flavour
quite
fruity
throughout
not
overly
acidic
nicely
balanced
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
up
front
a
bit
earthy
with
some
straw
and
grass
notes
light
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
enough
heft
to
keep
from
feeling
thin
carbonation
was
moderate
pretty
nice
overall
and
easier
drinking
than
some
other
beers
in
the
style
due
to
the
balanced
acidity
decently
done
i
guess
but
not
for
me
little
too
thin
and
a
little
too
sour
well
done
though
one
day
when
i
have
this
again
ill
surely
introduce
syrups
into
the
beverage
next
time
i
will
be
prepared
as
it
is
i
could
drink
it
everyday
of
the
summer
even
in
alaska
its
a
berliner
weissbier
and
only
3
10
it
poured
a
bright
yellow
it
smelled
a
bit
funky
brett
not
too
tart
but
with
a
bit
of
lemon
it
tasted
like
sour
lemons
green
apples
then
turns
to
yeast
it
is
very
light
and
i
learned
from
some
fabulous
east
bayers
that
it
is
meant
to
be
drunk
with
sweeten
syrups
which
i
would
love
to
try
sometime
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
carbonation
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
for
a
warm
day
ive
only
had
a
few
beers
of
this
style
but
so
far
ive
really
enjoyed
the
ones
ive
had
and
look
forward
to
drinking
this
more
often
during
the
summer
this
is
beyond
drinkable
the
abv
is
silly
low
the
flavors
are
just
enough
to
keep
interest
and
its
very
refreshing
i
really
wish
i
had
bought
like
5
of
these
now
pours
a
hazy
very
light
straw
with
creamy
two
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
lace
for
a
half
inch
or
so
smell
spicy
rye
and
a
slight
sour
funk
along
with
some
cornbread
taste
big
time
lemon
tart
with
a
little
sour
lemon
candy
thrown
in
there
too
something
a
bit
undercooked
yeasty
doughlike
about
the
finish
its
refreshing
and
sourtart
which
is
nice
but
the
750
is
certainly
enough
drinkability
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
ever
come
across
its
light
crisp
has
an
enjoyable
bit
of
tartness
to
it
all
with
a
very
sessionable
3
1
abv
i
could
easily
see
myself
enjoying
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
in
an
evening
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
drinkability
this
is
the
third
drainpour
i
have
had
out
of
over
900
different
beers
sampled
it
was
just
very
sour
with
no
other
characteristics
that
would
give
it
at
least
some
personality
the
two
friends
i
shared
it
with
totally
agreed
this
is
quite
to
style
which
calls
for
clean
with
a
solid
tartness
the
promise
of
brettanomyces
on
the
label
has
me
wishing
for
more
funkiness
as
this
is
on
the
low
side
but
it
does
have
a
nice
gripping
sourness
and
it
is
quite
clean
and
light
this
is
most
definitely
refreshing
and
a
testament
to
the
style
i
could
wish
for
more
funk
and
complexity
here
despite
the
fact
that
the
style
doesnt
call
for
it
in
the
end
this
is
still
a
really
really
nice
beer
i
wonder
if
the
brettanomyces
will
contribute
more
character
over
time
there
is
only
one
way
to
tell
and
i
have
a
couple
bottles
to
lay
down
and
try
the
process
out
d
awesome
at
3
1
it
doesnt
get
much
better
for
a
session
great
beer
for
a
summer
afternoon
for
sure
im
happy
i
bought
more
on
a
whim
when
i
was
in
wisconsin
awesome
drinkability
the
carbonation
was
a
little
light
for
the
style
which
is
supposed
to
be
highly
carbonated
around
4
volumes
this
felt
more
like
2
5
similar
to
an
american
pale
to
me
good
lighthearted
drink
relaxing
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
but
very
drinkable
for
the
style
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
the
head
fades
quickly
this
brew
is
lightly
carbonated
pleasing
sour
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
complex
tart
taste
with
massive
lemon
highlights
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easily
due
to
acidic
nature
of
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
average
one
or
two
glasses
will
do
when
all
is
said
and
done
this
is
a
good
brew
d
im
glad
beers
like
this
are
available
the
bruery
deserves
credit
for
taking
a
shot
at
this
rare
style
great
beer
for
warm
weather
and
also
for
sourlovers
who
want
something
sour
but
not
quite
at
the
same
level
as
a
lambic
drinkability
low
abv
and
ok
mouthfeel
but
flavor
profile
doesnt
make
me
want
more
with
a
very
good
taste
and
low
abv
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
m
d
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
snappy
carbonation
and
that
wonderful
dryness
that
i
always
appreciate
in
sour
brews
drinkability
is
rather
subjective
i
suppose
its
light
enough
in
alcohol
to
go
down
very
easily
but
tart
enough
that
its
not
really
appropriate
to
guzzle
all
that
aside
its
a
very
fine
brew
albeit
perhaps
something
of
a
mood
drink
nicely
done
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
had
this
on
tap
in
august
2009
at
baileys
taproom
in
portland
oregon
the
colour
was
a
very
light
straw
with
thin
head
the
aroma
was
redolent
of
tangy
citrus
and
yeast
on
the
palate
wow
quite
sour
more
so
than
i
expected
for
a
berliner
weisse
tangy
and
citrusy
with
a
very
refreshing
quick
finish
d
high
especially
given
the
low
abv
the
more
i
get
into
this
style
the
more
i
enjoy
it
d
this
is
damn
tasty
and
would
make
a
great
summer
quencher
and
nice
lawn
mower
beer
would
have
never
guessed
it
was
3
1
d
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
overall
however
i
can
appreciate
that
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinking
one
at
such
a
low
abv
sours
of
this
manner
really
just
arent
my
favorite
pours
the
palest
yellow
ive
ever
seen
in
a
beer
with
a
large
white
fluffy
head
that
left
little
lacing
a
lot
of
raw
wheat
in
the
aroma
grainy
husky
light
sourness
taste
is
more
sour
than
the
aroma
lets
on
light
funk
in
there
grassy
lemony
with
a
lovely
wheaty
twang
and
a
dry
finish
crisp
body
easy
to
drink
never
becomes
too
sour
really
not
digging
the
raw
wheat
aroma
when
i
take
a
sip
as
i
it
takes
away
from
the
good
flavor
i
try
to
hold
me
breath
wish
i
had
some
raspberry
syrup
to
pour
in
this
thing
not
bad
but
theres
still
no
berlinerweiss
that
can
hold
a
candle
to
ngs
unplugged
version
drinkability
very
drinkable
indeed
i
love
tartsour
beers
they
pique
the
tongues
interest
enough
that
when
the
flavor
fades
you
just
want
more
d
this
is
my
first
example
of
this
style
somewhat
thin
and
tart
i
personally
would
have
liked
a
fuller
body
to
this
beer
but
certainly
one
to
enjoy
a
few
pints
of
this
is
an
interesting
beer
from
the
bruery
it
is
very
light
and
refreshing
and
basically
tastes
like
lemonade
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
warm
day
like
today
or
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
whoa
this
is
sour
and
has
an
aftertaste
of
wheat
thats
unfortunate
the
sour
flavors
are
fine
but
the
cereal
rears
up
late
in
the
beer
and
kind
of
ruins
the
good
tartness
in
the
corners
of
my
mouth
no
sweetness
no
real
bitterness
to
it
drinkability
is
ok
mouthfeel
is
ok
overall
i
dont
really
care
for
it
though
d
i
love
sour
beers
but
im
new
to
the
berliner
weiss
while
i
prefer
belgian
sours
more
this
was
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
mit
schuss
raspberry
syrup
becomes
sweet
and
sour
and
not
as
dry
of
a
finish
poured
a
pale
gold
color
with
good
carbonation
nose
is
funk
and
spice
taste
is
grass
spice
funk
and
hardly
any
booze
at
all
so
much
flavor
and
so
little
alcohol
nice
a
little
tartness
fruits
but
mainly
citrus
a
very
good
low
abv
brew
with
good
taste
well
done
overall
a
very
nice
sour
i
prefer
more
complex
intensely
sour
beers
but
the
maltly
character
of
this
beer
is
quite
good
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
at
3
alcohol
it
is
a
definate
session
beer
and
a
replacement
to
any
light
beer
out
on
the
market
you
can
mix
this
with
different
flavored
syrups
and
make
it
taste
even
better
also
just
very
easy
drinking
palate
is
fairly
light
dry
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
exceptionally
high
awesome
for
the
style
and
really
good
overall
well
done
again
patrick
this
is
only
my
second
berliner
weiss
but
very
well
done
more
malty
and
less
tart
than
a
traditional
german
berliner
weisse
still
a
great
interpretation
i
loved
how
the
alcohol
is
only
3
1
yet
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
feel
thin
at
all
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
drinkability
is
high
jm
aboutto
drink
the
whole
750
myself
i
could
drink
sever
pints
at
a
bar
d
wasnt
sure
how
to
grade
this
as
its
the
first
of
the
style
ive
had
quote
unique
but
just
missing
something
can
understand
why
its
historically
flavored
with
syrups
would
love
to
try
it
the
traditional
way
d
all
day
long
super
easy
drinking
just
wish
it
was
a
little
bit
more
tart
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
kept
at
a
reasonable
level
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
and
for
the
style
is
even
better
a
weak
aftertaste
and
bit
of
wateriness
are
the
only
things
keeping
it
from
an
a
rating
for
me
we
bought
and
sampled
several
beers
that
night
and
used
this
one
as
a
palate
cleanser
between
ipas
i
recommend
that
you
pick
some
of
these
up
for
your
next
ipa
party
the
beer
by
itself
is
not
bad
but
it
is
a
bit
boring
i
dont
have
any
woodruff
but
i
found
some
raspberry
syrup
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
with
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
the
syrup
adds
a
nice
dimension
of
fruit
to
the
aroma
that
works
well
with
the
sourness
that
was
already
there
the
syrup
seems
to
boost
the
acidity
in
the
flavor
while
also
adding
a
bit
to
the
body
of
the
beer
i
only
added
a
little
bit
of
the
syrup
so
that
it
wouldnt
sweeten
the
beer
too
much
and
it
does
nothing
to
mask
the
nutty
wild
yeast
character
i
would
definitely
recommend
tasting
the
beer
straight
but
i
found
it
more
drinkable
with
the
added
complexity
of
the
fruit
d
drinkability
is
good
the
low
alcohol
and
abundance
of
flavors
make
this
a
very
interesting
choice
i
can
see
this
beer
being
very
good
in
warmer
weather
along
with
also
being
a
nice
compliment
to
a
hearty
winters
meal
this
is
one
of
a
few
times
that
i
can
easily
agree
with
the
750
ml
bottle
size
even
at
that
size
the
bottle
disappears
quickly
i
think
ill
be
hunting
down
more
examples
of
the
style
based
on
this
brew
another
good
beer
from
the
folks
at
the
bruery
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
maybe
a
tad
overdone
but
thats
par
for
the
course
with
bruerys
yearround
offerings
ive
had
this
one
is
not
extremely
complex
but
it
is
unbelievably
drinkable

a
clear

of

slight

light

flavor
is
initially
sweet
and
tart
with
a
bready
wheaty
finish
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
although
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
have
liked
mouthfeel
was
good
crisp

is
exceptional
its
so
pleasant

refreshing
it
goes
down
effortlessly
pours
yellow

the
aroma
is
very
tart
with
some
citrus
the
flavor
is
sour
wheat
lemon
other
citrus
and
some
spices
very
drinkable
and
a
light
bodied
beer
for
3
1
percent
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
flavor
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
albeit
tart
poured
into
a
berliner
kindl
weisse
pokal
formed
a
14
bright

over
the
cloudy
golden
brew
head
is
promptly
down
to
an
uneven

is
earthy
citric
tartness
taste
starts
lightly
tart
then
comes
full
on
lemon
in
the
middle
and
then
ends
dry
and
clean
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
for
such
a
sour
brew
and
drinkability
is
great
i
have
to
admit
that
im
very
surprised
with
this
one
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
bruery
event
and
was
not
impressed
at
all
after
sampling
this
bottle
i
have
to
say
that
hottenroth
is
probably
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
had
yet
i
was
recommended
this
from
my
local
retailer
and
i
am
a
fan
of
sour
acidictart
beers
including
this
style
it
could
use
a
splash
of
woodruff
or
raspberry
syrup
as
tradition
dictates
decent
beer
its
nice
to
see
someone
attempting
this
style
at
all
in
the
u
s
good
atmosphere
appearance
is
not
extravagant
but
very
nice
nose
is
powerful
but
not
offputting
flavor
is
very
tart
but
not
sweet
very
interesting
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
drinkability
immensely
refreshing
made
all
the
moreso
with
its
mere
hint
of
alcohol
at
3
8
its
good
to
see
somebody
over
here
trying
to
keep
this
style
alive
this
would
serve
as
a
fine
summertime
beverage
but
did
just
fine
as
a
kick
start
to
a
local
christmas
gathering
drinkability
is
quality
in
limited
quantities
i
love
sour
ales
my
limited
runs
with
berliner
weisse
thus
far
has
been
a
great
experience
time
to
try
some
german
versions
ive
only
had
nodding
head
and
dfh
versions
at
8
99
its
a
bit
much
for
a
session
ale
but
the
complexity
and
experience
made
it
worth
it
for
a
one
time
visit
id
have
see
this
one
more
readily
to
try
it
again
anytime
soon
next
stop
i
have
to
try
the
saison
rue
or
orchard
white
so
far
in
ohio
theres
only
like
4
or
5
at
the
most
varieties
of
the
bruerys
wares
around
overall
a
decently
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
but
not
tart
enough
to
be
an
awesome
berliner
a
style
we
dont
get
to
drink
often
so
thanks
to
the
bruery
for
giving
it
a
shot
this
brew
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
cloudy
and
even
lighter
than
a
lite
beer
the
head
is
frothy
and
white
but
goes
away
quickly
aroma
is
lemony
and
herbal
with
a
slight
funk
taste
is
the
same
lots
of
lemon
pepper
and
with
a
nice
sour
kick
that
brings
this
brew
together
still
a
little
thin
but
i
think
thats
the
point
of
this
brew
might
want
to
hit
1809
for
a
slightly
more
robust
version
all
in
all
very
tasty
hopefully
i
can
grab
a
couple
bottle
come
summer
d
pretty
decent
you
would
never
guess
this
beer
to
be
only
3
1abv
in
nature
which
had
a
huge
offering
of
flavor
and
sourness
making
this
a
decent
summer
time
quencher
a
bomber
suffices
here
due
to
its
fairly
strong
acidity
and
sour
nature
enjoyable
and
recommendable
d
at
only
3
1
as
light
as
youd
expect
quite
refreshing
overall
a
solid
representation
of
a
style
that
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
this
one
admittedly
not
my
favorite
style
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
could
see
myself
putting
back
gallons
of
this
on
a
hot
day
clear
light
golden
pour
with
a
thick
but
short
lived
white
head
smell
is
an
odd
mix
of
fresh
corn
lemon
zest
fresh
baked
bread
and
a
slight
touch
of
funk
taste
is
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
based
on
the
only
2
other
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
1809
and
festina
peche
tartness
and
acidity
is
very
mild
and
does
not
linger
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
drinkability
is
out
of
the
park
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
with
the
low
abv
it
would
be
perfect
for
just
that
at
9
00
a
bottle
though
it
would
make
for
a
long
and
expensive
night
md
very
light
in
body
and
quite
sessionable
could
have
been
a
bit
more
adventurous
in
the
sourfunk
department
but
a
good
berliner
for
the
uninitiated
very
very
light
on
the
palate
with
a
pleasant
but
fairly
non
descript
taste
it
is
tart
and
acidic
with
fruity
notes
but
all
a
bit
too
light
perhaps
on
a
very
hot
day
it
would
taste
better
it
is
certainly
not
bad
but
not
really
good
either
new
glarus
makes
a
significantly
better
version
everything
just
fell
away
once
i
took
a
sip
this
beer
ends
up
thin
bare
and
empty
maybe
this
is
a
berliner
weisse
which
really
requires
syrup
to
give
it
any
character
or
rather
to
cover
the
weak
but
unpleasant
characters
it
has
it
was
promising
on
the
nose
and
it
looked
the
part
but
it
couldnt
hold
its
end
up
when
it
counted
a
shame
great
session
beer
perfect
for
many
thirstquenching
occasions
nice
to
see
a
brewer
take
this
under
appreciated
style
and
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
mouthfeel
was
nice
carbonation
appropriate
not
terribly
drinkable
it
could
be
a
lot
better
for
its
abv
but
this
one
is
surprisingly
funky
and
too
much
so
to
be
able
to
gulp
down
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
chalice
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
it
smells
like
wheat
breaddough
lemon
and
also
a
bit
of
an
herbal
aroma
i
cant
identify
the
aroma
isnt
tart
at
all
however
that
all
changes
in
the
taste
tart
lemon
and
apple
flavors
show
up
first
and
theres
also
some
wheatgrain
and
herbs
noticable
in
the
taste
also
has
a
nice
lingering
tart
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
light
and
thin
and
it
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
its
crisp
refreshing
smooth
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
the
abv
being
just
3
1
going
through
a
bottle
of
this
is
pretty
easy
this
would
really
be
a
great
summer
beer
this
is
the
first
bruery
beer
ive
tried
and
it
certainly
wont
be
the
last
i
would
love
to
have
a
taste
of
what
a
chef
could
build
around
this
beer
drinkability
very
light
in
the
stomach
low
low
low
abv
and
not
overly
sour
not
problem
killing
the
whole
bottle
barely
felt
it
flavors
could
be
a
little
more
pronounced
but
overall
pretty
good
liked
it
better
than
the
1809
berliner
weiss
overall
this
is
a
decent
berliner
wiesse
a
few
adjustments
could
make
it
much
better
but
as
it
sits
it
is
good
to
see
this
style
emerging
more
on
the
us
made
front
an
ok
representation
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
maybe
buy
again
a
nice
beer
drinkability
fine
served
in
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
poured
a
translucent
pale
yellow
with
copious
tiny
bubbles
effervescing
in
solution
pour
generated
a
half
inch
loose
and
frothy
bright
white
head
that
quickly
dispersed
into
a
bubbly
skim
that
coalesced
around
the
edges
a
strong
doughy
aroma
was
revealed
off
the
cap
pop
with
a
lemony
quality
that
follows
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
breadiness
lightly
lingering
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
pleasant
background
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
pleasantly
refreshing
and
enjoyable
doesnt
beat
an
1809
but
still
very
good

commendable
drinkability
this
should
be
the
archetype
session
beer
for
any
occasion
although
one
might
find
it
most
refreshing
during
the
warmer
months
the
diminutive
volume
of
alcohol
levitates
the
drinkability
too
i
could
see
hottenroth
as
a
portal
into
the
craft
radius
a
refreshing
sour
beverage
which
would
serve
as
a
nice

for

good

a
fairly

of

something
a

i
do
have
a

a

though
all
descriptors
i
could
use
would
sound
kind
of
disgusting
the
first
thing
you
get
is
burnt
garbage
it
reminds
me
of
wild
yeast
that
i
caught
in
my
own
house
not
overpoweringly
sour
and
tart
and
the
taste
is
just
challenging
and
enjoyable
enough
that
i
could
drink
this
a
lot
when
everyone
asks
what
beer
would
you
choose
if
it
could
only
be
one
for
the
rest
of
your
life
assuming
that
it
wasnt
going
to
be
your
last
by

if
this
is
a

thing

really
wasnt

fizzy
with
a
small
white
head
sour
and
this
is
not
quite
right
its
not
horrible
well
and
you
do
have
taste
buds
its
also
an
easy
beer
to
blend
if
something
goes
astray
ive
never
had
another
beer
from
the
bruery
so
i
cant
judge
it
against
anything
else
theyve
done
hopefully
what
i
had
was
just
a
bad
batch
oh
a
nice
subdued
wheatiness
with
a
very
faint
fruitiness
wonderful
full
bodied
sour
maybe
a
bit
of
malic
acid
taste
could
also
be
lactic
acid
taste
in
any
event
its
kind
of
like
the
stuff
they
sprinkle
on
those
super
sour
gummie
worms
pale
yellow
pour
hazy
with
a
tiny
bubbly
head
that
disappeared
pretty
much
completely
leaving
no
lacing
on
the
glass
not
unusual
for
the
style
aroma
was
pretty
muted
light
scents
of
soured
grains
and
sweet
corn
the
taste
was
predominantly
grainy
toasted
wheat
light
sweetness
some
lemony
tartness
midpalate
with
a
big
grainy
finish
body
was
light
carbonation
was
low
mouthfeel
was
less
lively
than
i
prefer
for
a
berliner
not
bad
overall
but
nothing
id
go
back
for
very
drinkable
light
body
wellcarbonated
goes
down
really
easily
im
thinking
if
they
just
bottled
it
with
double
the
carbonation
it
would
be
a
bit
better
its
just
too
flat
and
one
dimensional
for
me
im
a
big
fan
of
peekskill
bc
but
this
one
just
didnt
hit
the
mark
for
me
o
being
nice
and
light
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
exhibits
some
refreshing
properties
overall
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
starts
tart
fades
fast
into
thin
refreshing
citrus
with
a
mildly
sour
finish
outstanding
sour
beer
o
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
light
in
flavor
and
body
makes
this
one
real
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
super
refreshing
wonderful
beer
of
saisons
hefes
and
summer
styles
this
is
what
i
would
love
to
drink
granted
i
would
like
a
wheat
hefe
with
its
malt
maybe
sometimes
but
this
really
pushes
the
other
way
and
is
just
lovely
great
intro
to
the
world
of
sours
type
of
beer
o
overall
a
very
nice
berliner
the
nose
is
great
full
of
sour
fruits
and
funk
while
the
taste
isnt
quite
on
par
it
is
very
good
as
well
would
definitely
have
it
again
and
glad
to
see
another
good
beer
from
peekskill
this
is
a
pretty
intense
berliner
weisse
probably
more
so
than
others
that
seem
to
carry
less
body
and
more
citrus
this
also
seems
more
wheat
forward
than
anything
else
i
will
also
say
it
seems
more
one
dimensional
than
i
would
like
kind
of
a
punch
and
then
thats
what
you
get
o
such
an
enjoying
beginning
to
a
tart
brew
that
chief
will
build
upon
really
like
this
and
hope
its
year
round
this
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
it
to
be
a
simple
sour
as
its
name
implies
that
could
be
the
base
beer
for
some
dynamite
things
to
come
delicious
glad
i
brought
home
four
growlers
to
share
overall
the
22oz
bottle
is
a
little
much
for
one
person
find
a
friend
with
some
cheese
and
crackers
and
enjoy
a
little
happy
hour
overall
nice
sour
beer
twentytwo
ounces
is
a
little
much
at
once
for
a
beer
so
tart
but
ask
yourself
how
much
tart
can
you
take
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
moderately
tart
taste
falls
away
to
a
more
yeasty
dry
finish
almost
breadlike
aftertaste
at
times
i
love
this
beer
so
tart
and
so
dry
o
light
crisp
sour
refreshing
ill
grab
more
of
this
if
i
see
it
next
summer
as
it
would
be
perfect
on
a
warm
summer
day
its
a
different
flavor
interesting
for
a
sour
but
not
my
thing
i
havent
had
many
berliner
weisses
but
this
is
the
best
among
those
ive
tried
with
others
ive
felt
the
need
to
mix
it
with
something
to
get
a
little
more
flavor
ginger
beer
is
a
favorite
but
white
birchs
attempt
is
flavorful
enough
on
its
own
kudos
for
a
great
summer
beer
this
is
highly
underrated
what
a
great
beer
overall
a
decent
tasting
beer
pretty
drinkable
but
it
seems
to
be
too
sweet
for
a
berliner
weisse
without
wheat
beer
qualities
dense
looking
presence
or
wheat
flavors
yellowishbeige
in
color
very
cloudy
opaque
a
small
white
head
when
poured
that
immediately
disappears
without
a
trace
while
initially
lots
of
small
carbonation
is
apparently
it
dies
down
quickly
and
then
the
beer
seems
quite
flat
overall
not
much
in
terms
of
appearance
faint
sour
smell
not
much
aroma
taste
starts
off
very
acidic
and
citrusy
progresses
to
a
lemonlike
sour
taste
then
progresses
to
a
smooth
wheat
flavor
and
ends
with
a
slightly
sour
and
dry
finish
i
must
admit
it
is
very
very
refreshing
it
was
nice
on
a
warm
summer
evening
light
to
medium
in
body
starts
with
a
definite
frizzy
feeling
in
your
mouth
followed
by
a
tart
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
light
sour
though
nothing
spectacular
i
would
drink
again
especially
on
a
warm
summer
day
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
not
something
that
i
am
likely
to
buy
again
i
like
berliners
to
be
much
more
tangy
and
sour
i
bought
this
to
compare
to
jamils
berliner
that
i
just
brewed
white
birchs
rendition
is
far
superior
and
thats
no
fault
of
jamil
truly
a
weird
take
on
the
classic
berliner
darker
in
looks
than
most
maybe
something
more
than
wheat
or
more
roast
on
it
or
some
crystal
added
tough
to
tell
really
heady
though
nice
and
white
and
lasting
obviously
well
carbonated
the
nose
is
straight
parmesan
cheese
never
smelled
this
in
a
beer
before
but
its
unmistakable
and
distinctly
parmesan
all
grated
and
stinking
thats
all
there
is
to
the
nose
cheese
the
flavor
starts
lighter
with
the
wheat
malt
than
it
looks
like
it
should
for
the
color
it
moves
quickly
to
the
parmesan
thing
again
so
odd
in
beer
i
get
some
fruitiness
in
the
finish
ripe
pears
white
grapes
and
even
some
green
apple
but
there
comes
the
cheese
again
and
i
really
cant
get
past
it
not
unpleasant
at
first
but
getting
less
and
less
tolerable
as
i
drink
on
it
and
finally
devolving
into
downright
weird
not
a
beer
i
care
to
really
drink
again
but
its
uniqueness
is
memorable
fine
carbonation
and
a
nice
frothy
feel
that
works
really
well
with
spicy
food
but
the
parmesan
cheese
finish
is
more
than
i
care
to
revisit
bottle
share
at
proof
courtesy
of
sconnell
pours
a
clear
straw
almost
no
head
or
collar
aroma
is
grassy
funky
and
some
white
grape
taste
is
tart
light
lemon
some
faint
earth
mediumhigh
carbonation
despite
the
lack
of
head
or
collar
good
light
crisp
body
it
does
hide
the
5
5
well
o
i
like
this
beer
nice
and
balanced
with
a
tartness
that
is
not
overpowering
good
quaffer
well
not
everything
was
perfect
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
few
more
bubbles
would
have
jacked
up
my
score
really
turned
this
into
a
nice
postlawnmower
beer
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
slight
head
and
no
real
lacing
despite
plenty
of
carbonation
nose
is
very
fruity
not
much
else
yeasty
raspberry
flavor
a
little
light
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
not
fully
matured
seems
this
beer
was
rushed
out
the
door
before
it
had
a
chance
to
really
develop
certainly
does
not
compare
to
schells
star
of
the
north
overall
a
refreshing
beer
thats
a
bit
more
sour
than
a
typical
beer
of
the
style
i
dig
it
though
overall
would
not
buy
again
its
not
a
terrible
tasting
beer
but
its
just
not
to
style
i
was
expecting
a
brewedtostyle
berliner
weisse
and
instead
i
got
something
that
was
not
this
is
truly
an
awful
waste
of
5
o
man
ive
given
out
a
lot
of
mediocre
scores
these
past
couple
of
days
havent
i
anyways
im
0
for
2
when
it
comes
to
berliners
and
this
one
didnt
even
have
any
sourness
to
it
instead
this
seems
like
an
odd
cider
drinkable
yes
but
not
particularly
good
ill
have
to
blow
more
to
really
gauge
whether
white
birch
deserves
its
status
as
a
memetic
joke
brewery
though
overall
tasty
but
a
sweeter
berliner
weisse
it
reminds
me
of
a
cider
almost
or
a
drier
asti
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
its
still
nice
bright
and
refreshing
id
certainly
enjoy
having
it
again
i
dont
know
what
happened
to
this
beer
but
the
brewery
should
seriously
consider
decontaminating
their
equipment
before
bottling
more
of
this
or
any
other
beer
white
birch
berliner
weisse
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
the
aroma
is
fairly
sour
and
grainy
but
not
overpowering
the
flavor
is
quite
tart
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
sourness
hits
right
away
and
lingers
the
beer
is
quite
dry
overall
there
is
an
odd
sour
wortiy
character
in
the
finish
but
its
mild
and
im
guessing
is
a
by
product
of
the
lacto
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
the
style
but
this
is
the
best
commercial
example
im
had
22
ounce
bottle
bottled
summer
2013
5

abv
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
didnt
stay
around
for
too
long
there
isnt
much
lacing
aroma
is
light
it
smells
like
apricots
bready
maltwheat
and
some
lemon
peel
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
apple
juice
adds
some
sweet
flavors
in
this
brew
and
green
apples
i
think
the
brew
has
more
tartness
compared
to
the
aroma
however
the
tartness
isnt
exactly
strong
at
all
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
coating
and
easy
enough
to
drink
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
not
one
of
the
better
berliner
weisses
ive
tried
i
cant
complain
too
much
at
4

a

its

a
try
at

price

and

the
drinkability
isnt
very
pleasant
definitely
not
a
very
good
presentation
of
the
berliner
weiss
style
this
is
another
typical
white
birch
brew
that
bombs
for
me
ive
had
way
too
many
bottles
from
these
guys
in
the
past
that
werent
much
better
o
4
00
tart
puckering
berliner
weisse
ive
definitely
had
better
but
love
the
style
and
still
enjoying
this
one
as
i
type
o
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
most
enjoyable
i
visited
the
brewery
today
and
it
was
closed
to
my
dismay
however
an
employee
inside
spotted
me
and
opened
up
the
store
so
i
could
buy
a
few
bottles
have
to
give
a
shout
out
to
white
birch
brewing
for
that
kind
of
awesome
customer
service
odwas
expecting
better
here
i
bet
this
beer
was
great
in
its
infancy
batch
1
or
2
now
i
just
dont
see
how
this
is
a
relatively
desired
beer
its
not
bad
but
its
probably
the
worst
berliner
i
have
had
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
and
murky
yellow
its
body
is
completely
opaque
though
it
does
allow
light
to
come
through
and
a
slight
run
of
carbonation
bubbles
can
be
seen
running
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
beer
pours
with
a
very
soapy
looking
head
made
of
big
loose
bubbles
but
this
quickly
fades
away
to
nothing
on
the
nose
this
beer
smells
gross
like
rubbing
alcohol
and
cleaning
products
with
a
strong
touch
of
pine
sol
i
feel
like
the
lacto
may
have
been
given
too
much
time
to
run
free
in
this
beer
gross
fruity
alcohol
is
really
the
only
character
i
get
on
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
much
better
than
the
smell
with
very
metallic
sour
notes
and
not
a
lot
else
the
beer
begins
with
clear
and
brutal
lactic
sour
with
a
touch
of
chalk
this
brutal
sour
opens
into
slight
lemon
and
the
faintest
whisper
of
wheat
bread
make
it
into
the
finish
and
aftertaste
but
for
the
most
part
there
is
just
clear
lactic
sour
running
through
this
beer
which
is
much
more
pleasing
than
the
smell
but
still
a
little
too
sour
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
prickly
and
puckering
yet
with
a
medium
light
body
the
mouth
is
left
pouring
with
saliva
from
the
sour
and
a
chalky
film
covering
the
rest
of
the
mouth
overall
im
not
quite
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
i
appreciate
the
lactic
flavors
and
they
have
clearly
grown
strong
since
the
beer
was
bottled
in
august
but
they
are
little
too
brutal
on
the
tongue
and
there
really
isnt
anything
else
going
on
in
the
taste
i
want
more
of
the
faint
bread
on
the
taste
and
perhaps
there
is
more
when
this
beer
is
fresh
in
conclusion
i
wouldnt
try
and
age
this
beer
for
longer
than
3
months
but
i
would
be
interested
to
try
it
fresh
o
the
one
major
disappointment
i
had
with
this
beer
was
according
to
the
bjcp
style
guidelines
a
berliner
weisse
should
fall
between
2
83
8
abv
this
beer
is
double
that
at
6
8
abv
while
i
am
not
usually
one
to
complain
about
a
high
abv
or
a
beer
pushing
the
boundaries
of
the
style
guidelines
i
was
looking
to
enjoy
an
expertly
crafted
nuanced
meticulously
malted
3
weisse
the
increased
abv
does
not
take
anything
away
from
the
flavor
or
any
of
the
characteristics
but
it
is
outside
of
the
style
guidelines
it
is
a
little
to
high
to
be
a
fine
sessionable
weisse
i
understand
it
may
be
hard
to
sell
a
beer
that
is
low
in
abv
but
i
digress
this
beer
is
impressive
and
has
been
loved
dearly
by
someone
who
has
the
skill
and
heart
to
pull
off
such
a
gutsy
brew
kudos
to
white
birch
for
making
a
sour
lover
pucker
with
joy
bottle
labeled
batch
1
o
i
cant
get
past
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
good
but
the
aroma
is
enough
that
i
would
avoid
this
one
although
it
does
have
some
nice
tart
lemonlemonade
character
overall
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
it
seems
to
me
as
they
should
be
using
better
quality
water
flavours
are
spot
on
but
you
can
taste
crappy
water
aftertaste
o
though
im
not
really
into
this
beer
i
cant
say
too
much
about
it
since
it
is
my
first
one
of
this
style
id
probably
only
revisit
to
compare
to
others
of
this
style
but
will
say
this
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
o
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
white
birchs
berliner
weisse
is
the
perfect
refresher
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
delicious
sour
power
for
any
other
time
its
wellbalanced
and
nicely
sour
without
being
too
mouthpuckering
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
a
style
thats
getting
much
more
attention
o
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
is
getting
low
marks
maybe
there
is
huge
variation
in
how
the
wild
yeast
strains
treated
it
or
how
it
was
stored
for
the
past
few
months
since
being
brewed
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
how
the
style
should
taste
its
a
very
refreshing
and
tasty
brew
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
i
will
decline
future
offerings
of
this
beer
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
grain
funk
stinky
cheese
and
some
distinct
vomit
aromas
taste
is
of
sour
wheat
tart
lemon
and
a
slight
funk
flavor
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
based
on
taste
only
but
i
must
say
this
one
has
a
pretty
horrible
aroma
that
made
me
not
even
want
to
take
a
sip
o
as
with
the
other
high
gravity
berliner
ive
had
this
beer
really
gets
away
from
the
spirit
of
the
style
interesting
sure
but
not
really
that
good
o
very
simple
a
bit
tart
but
very
refreshing
pretty
strong
for
a
berliner
but
no
indication
as
to
the
alcohol
content
refreshing
and
crisp
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
from
a
berliner
from
batch
two
dated
april
2012
no
1428
sampled
on
may
27
2012
this
is
one
of
white
birchs
main
releases
it
has
a
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
small
shotlived
head
and
it
is
cloudy
the
aroma
is
pungent
with
lemon
zest
and
citrus
with
a
notable
yeast
ester
and
a
less
forward
wheat
sensation
the
body
is
light
and
creamy
the
taste
is
also
alive
with
lemon
zest
and
sour
lingering
aftertaste
the
wheat
is
much
more
subdued
in
the
flavor
than
on
the
nose
this
a
style
that
you
have
to
really
like
to
appreciate
the
work
that
white
birch
put
into
it
lighter
body
high
carbonation
lingering
and
dry
on
the
tongue
i
really
like
berliner
weiss
beers
but
this
really
wasnt
that
good
kind
of
a
bummer
overall
just
a
blah
bland
beer
o
this
was
a
crappy
beer
and
lived
up
to
the
reputation
that
white
birch
has
established
not
a
good
beer
still
looking
for
that
quality
white
birch
brew
not
the
worst
beer
of
theres
ive
ever
had
but
that
would
be
so
hard
to
do
its
not
saying
a
whole
lot
d
this
isnt
offensive
like
many
of
the
other
white
birch
offerings
ive
tried
but
its
not
very
good
either
just
kind
of
boring
with
excessive
albeit
wellhidden
alcohol
for
the
style
overall
its
like
a
saison
or
watery
wild
o
an
excellent
berliner
weisse
kudos
to
white
birch
for
putting
their
distinctive
spin
on
an
underappreciated
style
while
not
quite
up
to
hottenroth
standards
i
would
certainly
pick
up
more
of
this
if
available
doest
look
exactly
like
a
berlinner
weiss
clearer
than
it
should
be
pale
golden
straw
with
a
wispy
white
head
aroma
is
horrible
nail
polish
remover
pepper
and
lacto
flavor
is
a
mild
redemption
sour
and
lemon
yeasty
and
watery
finish
more
like
a
hefesaison
hybrid
than
what
i
expect
from
the
style
keeps
with
the
trend
of
failing
like
every
other
wb
beer
ive
enjoyed
cheers
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
its
just
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
4
5
d
a
solid
berliner
weiss
extremely
thirst
quenching
and
crisp
a
great
example
from
the
states
d
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
can
see
why
this
style
was
referred
to
as
the
champagne
of
the
north
great
sour
notes
with
a
refreshing
finish
and
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
if
its
the
temperature
outside
or
my
new
dive
into
the
sour
realm
but
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
the
cpj
md
light
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
as
well
as
crisp
and
refreshing
like
this
one
a
lot
dvery
drinkable
love
the
sour
after
taste
would
not
have
guessed
abv
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
pure
white
head
as
bubbles
aggressively
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
the
top
looks
very
much
like
a
slighted
more
yellow
carbonated
lemonade
the
smell
is
sour
funky
fruit
with
a
bit
of
breadiness
in
the
background
there
is
also
a
slight
dirty
barnyard
earthiness
to
it
reminiscent
of
a
saison
taste
is
puckering
lemon
upfront
follow
by
a
smoky
bread
character
that
is
very
unique
there
is
a
also
a
chalky
yeast
flavor
but
other
than
that
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
mouth
is
dry
and
bubbly
and
goes
down
pretty
easily
lacing
a
funky
lemon
taste
in
the
mouth
i
could
have
one
or
two
of
these
but
its
not
one
of
the
best
berliner
weisse
ive
had
d
eaaaasy
drinking
dangerously
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
and
refreshing
but
would
probably
sneak
up
on
me
at
6
4
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
easy
would
also
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
by
the
pool
d
decently
drinkable
not
really
much
going
on
with
this
one
though
i
dunno
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
more
if
it
didnt
bring
up
memories
of
another
bottle
of
it
that
broke
in
one
of
my
suitcases
i
dunno
ive
had
other
takes
on
this
style
that
i
enjoyed
more
d
good
the
best
thing
i
have
had
from
white
birch
the
feel
of
this
beer
seems
light
but
its
complex
flavor
seems
to
be
handled
with
two
hands
there
is
a
lot
to
pay
attention
to
in
this
beer
and
can
go
unnoticed
if
you
are
not
looking
hard
enough
other
than
shandy
style
beers
this
is
pretty
much
adult
lemonade
for
the
summertime
this
beer
was

drinkability
was
very
nice
for
a
light
wheat
beer
with
a
dash
of
tartness
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
with
some
age
on
it
also
highly
drinkable
beer
this
would
be
fantastic
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
sitting
in
an
outdoor
cafe
in
the
city
watching
all
the
pretty
people
wish
they
were
drinking
my
beer
alcohol
is
a
little
high
for
the
style
but
it
really
doesnt
come
through
this
is
my
first
white
birch
beer
but
i
have
to
say
theyve
got
this
one
down
cold
if
you
like
berliner
weisse
on
the
bigger
sourer
side
like
i
do
then
this
is
one
to
seek
out
nicely
done
chaps
thanks
to
todes
and
bobby8405
for
sharing
an
incredible
example
of
drinkability
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
incredibly
refreshing
i
would
love
to
drink
this
again
got
this
1
9
pint
for
4
99
as
a
seasonal
clearance
saw
it
again
today
for
10
it
is
pretty
much
cost
prohibitive
for
me
to
get
this
at
full
price
still
very
very
good
d
awesome
no
alcohol
detected
great
for
any
season
particularly
hot
weather
taste
is
light
and
crisp
the
carbonation
that
did
not
provide
any
head
is
present
in
the
mouthfeel
and
is
assertive
lightly
sour
and
not
overwhelming
good
lemony
zest
to
it
the
strength
is
not
evident
in
the
taste
but
at
6
7
it
is
way
too
strong
for
a
berliner
weisse
otherwise
its
a
good
bw
to
drink
bubbly
carbonation
with
a
great
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
for
a
sour
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
haze
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
some
lemon
and
green
apples
the
taste
is
slightly
sour
with
lactic
character
and
some
tartness
very
very
mild
funk
comes
through
feel
is
light
with
slight
sourness
the
drinkability
is
okay
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
either
a
bit
plain
pours
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
vanishes
leaving
no
lace
clear
pale
yellow
green
color
remarkably
like
urine
strong
carbonation
and
very
light
bodied
lemon
and
yeast
nose
flavor
is
fizzy
tart
lemon
and
yeast
hops
are
hidden
this
would
be
a
good
lawnmower

md
mouthfeel
is
light
with
ample
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
perhaps
the
most
refreshing
sour
i
have
had
to
date
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderately
high
level
of
carbonation
quite
drinkable
there
are
no
issues
finishing
a
glass
at
more
than
6
abv
this
is
really
stretching
the
limits
for
the
style
but
the
alcohols
character
is
hidden
well
enough
until
the
brew
gets
too
warm
if
you
were
going
to
anticipate
this
experience
based
off
the
way
this
brew
looks
you
are
going
to
be
in
for
a
real
surprise
lots
of
flavor
going
on
inside
this
brew
despite
the
fact
that
it
honestly
looks
like
it
doesnt
have
much
to
offer
well
done
taste
is
super
tart
i
guess
its
ok
for
the
style
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
it
at
all
its
just
too
sharp
and
harsh
ive
had
a
couple
of
the
style
and
this
is
just
too
harsh
d
my
first
beer
from
white
birch
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
i
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
not
my
favorite
berliner
weisse
but
it
is
a
great
attempt
at
one
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
very
easy
drinking
i
am
enjoying
this
one
i
like
the
funk
meeting
the
sour
in
this
one
bottle

super
rare
batch
1
at
that
i
can
taste
the
rarity
already
god
bless
white
birch
and
their
small
bottle
count
the
smell
is
wheaty
with
some
lemon
zest
type
notes
slighlty
funky
smelling
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
whiteish
straw
color
with
a
tight
white
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
good
carbonation
a
very
clean
tasting
beer
very
light
wheat
taste
with
a
nice
little
zesty
lemon
taste
ends
very
cleany
i
actually
am
pretty
surprised
i
think
this
is
a
good
rendition
of
a
berliner
light
mouthfeel
no
real
pickup
of
the
6
4
alcohol
d
a
little
strong
for
a
berliner
weisse
no
either
way
the
citric
bite
is
enough
to
bring
me
to
the
table
d
goes
down
easily
minor
kick
very
tart
in
comparison
to
the
other
berliner
weisse
but
not
bad
for
a
pint
or
two
dthis
is
slightly
off
notes
of
rubber
throughout
the
flavor
the
sourness
is
rather
well
done
enough
to
be
present
and
enjoyable
pretty
good
still
think
new
glarus
made
the
best
berliner
weiss
though
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
12
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
and
refreshing
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
some
acidic
tart
yeast
esters
there
are
some
musty
barnyard
smells
as
well
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
sour
wheat
malt
flavor
along
with
some
lactobacillus
character
its
light
and
easy
drinking
with
a
stiff
sourness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
the
yeast
character
is
very
refreshing
making
this
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
beer
white
birch
berliner
weisse
was
a
huge
disappointment
for
me
as
i
was
excited
to
try
something
from
white
birch
the
flavors
were
off
and
the
abv
is
way
too
large
for
the
style
pours
a
murky
and
hazy
pale
lemonade
color
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
wheaty
and
lemony
citrus
yeast
and
lacto
tart
dominate
the
taste
with
a
funky
curdled
astringency
not
a
bad
thing
mildly
sweet
with
a
faint
flowery
quality
that
is
challenging
to
identify
a
soapy
slickness
adds
to
the
thin
mouthfeel
crisp
tart
and
refreshing
overall
interesting
thanks
to

bottle

pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
bright
white
halfinch
head
that
quickly
dissipates
clarity
is
semihazy
nose
is
predominantly
yeasty
with
light
citrus
lemons
and
some
light
herbal
nuances
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
theres
also
a
slightly
milky
quality
and
citric
acid
present
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
an
easy
palate
cleansing
carbonation
and
just
a
kiss
of
astringency
that
slightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
wellhidden
abv
at
6
40
somewhat
high
for
the
style
unfortunately
the
limited
distribution
and
9
99
price
tag
make
this
a
little
tough
to
swallow
that
being
said
a
very
solid
beriner
weiss
overall
super
sad
face
md
super
sour
true
to
style
the
more
berliner
weisses
i
try
the
more
i
like
them
well
done
a
fine
introduction
for
me
to
white
birch
well
done
quite
drinkable
d
the
berliner
weisse
style
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beer
styles
and
this
brew
fits
the
bill
perfectly
refreshingly
tart
light
crisp
refreshing
and
rather
low
in
abv
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
sip
all
day
long
indeed
a
suitable
summer
libation
an
odd
but
still
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
why
is
the
abv
so
high
thats
a
little
offstyle
not
too
good
overall
i
am
very
pleased
to
have
picked
this
up
at
granite
in
the
past
week
the
color
is
like
most
of
the
white
birch
beers
i
have
tried
it
is
straw
colored
and
cloudy
with
a
minimal
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
tart
lemons
and
grains
the
taste
is
a
sharp
sour
lemon
tang
grass
and
straw
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
the
carb
levels
are
kinda
sharp
with
tiny
bubbles
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
and
would
love
to
drink
this
all
summer
long
d
a
very
refreshing
interpretation
of
a
warm
weather
classic
god
i
have
been
digging
the
berliner
weiss
lately
stoked
to
see
this
on
the
shelf
of
my
local
beer
store
granite
rules
poured
into
a
portsmouth
tulip
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
no
head
after
a
semiaggressive
pour
sour
lemon
wheat
and
a
bit
of
plastic
on
the
nose
taste
is
tart
lemon
grassy
fairly
dry
mouthfeel
good
interpretation
of
the
style
even
with
the
heightened
abv
great
summer
sipper
this
beer
pours
out
looking
a
lot
like
still
lemonade
sort
of
a
cloudy
yellow
color
the
aroma
is
tart
and
a
little
fruity
theres
little
to
no
carbonation
more
a
little
fizzy
thin
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
mostly
dominated
by
tartness
with
a
little
bread
wheat
one
the
backside
finish
is
quite
dry
somewhat
refreshing
but
please
note
that
this
is
certainly
not
a
beer
for
beginners
overall
a
great
interpretation
of
this
style
and
an
immediate
favorite
summer
beer
for
me
this
is
my
sixth
or
seventh
bottle
already
and
i
plan
on
having
more
highly
recommended
as
an
update
i
received
a
bottle
of
this
in
a
recent
trade
i
opened
it
and
the
same
flavor
profile
exists
so
its
certainly
not
an
isolated
incident
overall
wierd
beer
not
sure
if
its
truely
a
berliner
weisse
hmmm
ok
this
is
a
very
unusual
style
for
me
im
therefore
going
to
rate
this
beer
based
on
its
style
and
characteristics
and
not
on
if
i
like
it
or
not
i
will
say
that
i
dont
hate
it
its
just
very
strange
it
seriously
tastes
like
im
drinking
a
hotdog
with
ketchup
at
a
baseball
game
wheat
and
yeast
is
prominent
obviously
mixed
with
the
funky
sourness
a
mild
earthy
tone
resides
booze
is
not
a
factor
at
all
carbonation
is
high
and
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
not
my
idea
of
a
refreshing
beer
but
very
interesting
this
is
a
fantastic
representation
and
one
of
the
best
sour
beers
that
ive
had
white
birch
is
producing
some
amazing
brews
with
the
only
downside
being
the
high
pricepoint
that
is
typically
associated
with
quality
small
batch
brewing
d
incredibly
delicious
beer
with
a
great
feel
light
crisp
clean
and
extremely
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
and
humid
day
like
today
bought
a
bottle
after
tasting
it
tonight
and
talking
with
the
brewerowner
bill
great
guy
who
really
puts
a
great
deal
of
effort
and
thought
into
his
brewing
and
it
shows
i
could
drink
this
very
regularly
and
be
quite
happy
with
keeping
this
on
hand
consistently
great
job
guys
overall
simply
amazing
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
come
across
hands
down
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
have
this
all
the
time
but
on
these
hot
days
it
is
a
must
big
thanks
to
my
buddy
bradford
for
sharing
this
with
me
poured
this
into
a
white
birch
goblet
pours
a
pale
yellow
white
color
kind
of
looks
like
lemonade
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
dissipated
in
seconds
smell
hits
me
with
a
big
lemon
tart
funky
yeast
and
it
finishes
with
sulfuric
smell
reminds
me
of
hard
boiled
eggs
taste
is
tart
upfront
lots
of
lemon
with
a
hint
of
heavy
spices
cloves
with
a
bit
of
wheat
at
the
end
decent
mouth
feel
on
this
nice
carbonation
and
light
body
the
abv
and
light
body
makes
it
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
enjoying
this
well
enough
to
start
the
night
j
id
be
really
interested
to
see
where
this
one
went
with
some
time
in
a
barrel
with
brett
d
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
especially
in
the
heat
of
summer
excellent
as
a
refresher
and
thirst
quencher
alcohol
is
a
bit
high
for
the
style
but
doesnt
detract
from
its
drinkability
given
what
im
used
to
drinking
the
level
really
isnt
that
high
when
compared
to
some
of
the
best
berliner
weisse
beers
out
there
this
seems
to
be
missing
a
little
bit
thinking
its
a
lack
of
lemony
aspects
this
definitely
has
lemon
character
but
pretty
straight
forward
missing
some
of
the
nuances
also
the
malt
seems
a
bit
subdued
in
the
flavor
profile
and
the
aroma
is
light
overall
too
i
feel
like
im
being
too
critical
here
because
it
is
quite
good
but
just
missing
some
of
the
special
aspects
of
the
best
examples
d
really
easy
to
drink
like
you
would
expect
surprisingly
high
in
alcohol
for
the
style
about
double
the
usual
but
even
at
6
not
really
noticeable
pretty
solid
berliner
weisse
i
actually
wrote
on
my
notes
i
wish
i
had
more
to
say
about
this
but
its
just
a
solid
well
put
together
example
of
the
style
that
about
sums
it
up
light
refreshing
mouthfeel
d
good
stuff
would
like
to
drink
some
more
of
this
a
bit
unusual
even
for
the
style
although
im
not
an
expert
but
it
works
for
me
perfect
in
this
heat
overall
enjoyable
for
the
style
definitely
looking
forward
to
more
of
this
d
what
a
great
summer
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
great
summer
session
beer
overall
it
seems
that
white
birch
gets
better
with
every
beer
they
put
out
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
this
a
true
berliner
weisse
but
it
is
a
tasty
sour
wheat
ale
like
the
bottle
says
very
refreshing
and
the
sourness
is
about
perfect
fun
to
drink
pick
a
couple
up
if
you
can
smells
of
tart
lemons
grainy
malts
spicy
wheat
and
a
hint
of
funk
taste
is
much
more
tart
than
the
nose
suggested
with
lemons
piercing
my
taste
buds
with
every
sip
tart
lemons
up
front
some
wheat
malt
sends
some
spice
through
mid
way
a
little
funk
in
there
and
a
long
lingering
lemon
pie
in
the
finish
crisply
sharp
carbonation
with
a
light
body
and
a
tangy
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
refreshing
warm
weather
drink
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
maybe
a
little
strong
for
the
style
abv
wise
but
it
certainly
didnt
affect
my
enjoyment
of
this
brew
great
job
bill
the
beer
is
very
light
well
carbonated
and
crisp
the
acidic
lemon
tartness
and
the
dry
finish
make
this
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
perfect
for
summertime
at
almost
6
5
it
packs
a
better
punch
than
other
berliner
weisses
i
have
had
but
its
welcome
as
the
alcohol
doesnt
hinder
the
flavor
or
drinkability
whatsoever
grabbed
a
few
of
these
at
berts
today
along
with
some
of
their
other
new
releases
this
is
bottle
779
out
of
1458
from
the
first
batch
the
pour
reveals
a
hazy
barely
pale
straw
colored
ale
with
two
fingers
of
white
heading
the
smell
is
full
of
sour
funk
light
citrus
fruit
think
lemons
something
sort
of
egg
like
and
more
funk
the
wheat
is
more
apparent
in
the
taste
with
the
sour
character
backing
it
up
nicely
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
but
with
more
body
than
other
examples
i
have
had
drinkability
is
perfect
for
really
hot
summer
days
like
this
one
certainly
a
well
made
berliner
weiss
we
have
here
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
this
get
distributed
to
the
massachusetts
market
o
very
mellow
and
well
integrated
flavors
subtle
overall
but
fairly
complex
i
got
something
new
with
every
sip
overall
its
a
little
more
interesting
than
a
standard
berliner
brett
and
oak
help
it
out
pour
is
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
small
amount
of
white
head
nose
is
heavy
leather
brett
lactic
notes
tons
of
green
apple
oily
hops
taste
is
off
like
the
nose
the
green
apple
is
completely
out
of
place
the
body
is
syrupy
and
slick
lactic
acid
is
low
not
delicate
or
to
style
o
very
good
berliner
weisse
heavier
on
the
oak
barrels
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
4
loved
how
the
bretta
and
how
it
balanced
against
the
tartness
great
beer
o
base
beer
for
some
of
the
fw
sours
standing
alone
this
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
although
there
is
a
nice
tartness
but
not
too
crazy
33
53
53
253
5
more
or
less
a
berliner
style
beer
just
more
brett
than
lacto
still
the
same
pale
wheat
base
listed
on
the
hops
and
pie
draft
list
at
4
9
abv
which
is
far
more
sizable
than
the
listed
content
here
seems
light
though
and
so
pale
hazy
in
color
caucasian
looking
beer
here
creamy
and
rich
and
pale
and
peachy
the
nose
is
familiar
white
wheat
malt
in
healty
dose
and
subtle
brett
c
type
yeast
along
with
mild
and
immature
lacto
which
if
left
to
get
weird
probably
would
before
too
long
some
sturdy
oak
on
this
too
sweet
and
woodsy
even
a
hint
of
sap
to
it
richer
than
any
berliner
weisse
on
the
market
but
in
the
same
family
albeit
loosely
the
development
of
the
wild
side
of
this
is
extremely
pleasant
up
there
with
the
other
firestone
beers
and
not
all
that
different
from
lil
opal
although
i
think
i
like
that
one
a
bit
more
this
one
sits
a
little
heavy
at
room
temperature
and
never
really
gets
to
the
sour
level
supremely
well
made
though
and
this
would
surely
satisfy
any
drinking
of
the
lighter
side
of
wild
ale
it
certainly
works
for
me
thanks
to
hops
and
pie
on
tennyson
for
making
this
come
to
life
for
me
scrumptious
rarity
i
was
largely
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
and
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
function
of
how
its
marketed
or
if
its
just
not
that
great
as
a
berliner
weisse
its
not
very
good
its
fairly
flat
and
watery
with
minimal
tartness
notes
of
straw
overtake
any
pleasant
maltiness
or
sour
bite
it
might
have
had
the
brett
funkiness
is
pleasing
but
eclipses
some
of
the
other
notes
usually
present
in
a
berliner
weisse
perhaps
i
expected
too
much
and
maybe
i
should
have
adjusted
my
expectations
for
something
less
a
berliner
weisse
and
more
a
slightly
tart
saison
which
even
then
this
wouldnt
be
a
very
good
example
of
its
worth
tasting
but
i
wouldnt
return
to
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
malt
grain
spice
lemon
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
malt
and
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
fairly
watery
and
lacking
in
sourness
d
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
appreciate
the
sub5
abv
too
as
there
are
too
many
of
these
6
berliners
popping
up
probably
more
appropriate
for
the
summertime
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
beer
was
solid
for
the
style
delivered
on
the
sour
and
passionfruit
front
would
order
again
overall
nice
berliner
the
passionfruit
aroma
belied
a
much
more
intense
beer
that
never
materialized
a
mild
and
interesting
fruited
sour
beer
rough
around
the
edges
but
a
starter
beer
for
those
just
getting
into
sours
as
the
casual
drinker
can
easily
pick
out
the
fruit
handle
the
sour
and
begin
to
search
out
the
funk
and
yeast
involved
not
bad
not
wild
in
a
good
way
little
lactic
acid
and
bad
yeast
amazing
pour
is
clear
pale
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
tight
white
head
nose
has
some
rich
rounded
honey
grains
and
doughy
malt
the
fruits
are
more
red
tropical
punch
and
more
clean
grain
taste
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
no
off
flavor
grains
arent
nearly
as
strong
but
there
notes
of
honey
a
fuller
body
than
you
would
normally
see
on
a
berliner
sugary
fruitiness
and
tropical
punch
faint
citrus
and
low
acidity
slightly
sour
and
high
carbonation
disappears
from
your
glass
excellent
balance
between
passionfruit
and
sour
everything
is
in
proportion
here
and
works
well
together
lightly
sour
a
little
fruit
sweetness
and
finishes
clean
and
refreshing
similar
to
a
grapefruit
mimosa
without
the
overload
of
sweetness
nor
presence
of
high
alcohol
o
poor
looking
but
excellent
nonetheless
light
golden
color
slight
head
smell
of
slightly
tart
fruit
with
wheat
overtones
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
and
balanced
fruit
is
pronounced
and
theres
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
kick
finish
is
lasting
with
tartness
and
makes
the
beer
truly
stand
out
great
job
guys
the
sourness
of
the
passion
fruit
melds
well
with
the
sourness
of
the
lactic
acid
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
rich
overall
quite
good
overall
really
enjoying
this
i
dont
get
nearly
enough
berliners
and
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
great
job

overall
a
delightful
little
berliner
fresh
clean
and
drinkable
very
citrus
smell
with
west
but
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
a
good
beer
if
you
like
german
wheat
beers
a
tart
lemon
barnyard
weisse
beer
i
really
like
this
as
it
is
refreshing
if
definitely
seek
this
out
again
nice
and
tart
and
tasty
i
like
it
a
lot
a
nice
delicious
beer
the
outstanding
flavor
profile
is
reasonably
intense
not
very
complex
but
is
perfectly
balanced
and
allows
the
effervescence
to
showcase
the
flavor
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
tart
lemon
that
coats
the
tongue
until
the
middle
where
a
light
biscuit
sweetness
creeps
in
underneath
hops
make
a
slightly
bitter
appearance
as
the
middle
ends
the
finish
is
slightly
sour
at
first
then
fades
into
a
slight
tart
sweetness
and
finishes
dry
the
5
may
disappoint
the
hop
heads
as
will
the
lack
of
a
hoppy
presence
but
if
you
call
yourself
a
beer
drinker
you
should
let
this
brew
show
you
how
things
can
be
funky
aromas
of
barnyard
hay
and
lemon
drop
candies
bright
effervescence
tickles
the
tip
of
the
tongue
sweet
flavors
of
candy
citrus
and
lemongrass
along
the
mid
palate
a
bright
twang
of
tart
flavor
with
a
just
a
touch
of
sour
acidity
underneath
the
tongue
and
along
the
gums
that
makes
the
mouth
water
body
is
super
light
and
bubbly
with
a
certain
silkiness
about
it
finish
is
surprisingly
very
dry
balancing
the
acidity
of
the
beer
with
lots
of
lingering
flavors
the
tart
qualities
that
make
this
style
unique
are
in
check
enough
to
allow
light
biscuity
and
grainy
notes
from
the
malt
present
themselves
on
the
finish
as
they
linger
on
the
palate
delicate
and
refreshing
an
addicting
amazing
german
beer
not
to
sour
just
right
for
hot
summer
day
this
may
be
my
first
authentic
german
version
of
the
style
i
must
say
i
prefer
the
more
powerful
americanized
ones
but
for
what
it
is
its
quite
good
balanced
and
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
honey
yellow
with
thin
white
head
smells
of
apricot
belgian
yeast
and
dried
fruits
sweet
orange
chardonnay
and
wheat
nice
effervescence
and
chardonnay
aftertaste
medium
light
body
goes
nicely
with
the
style
pours
slightly
hazy
light
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
smell
has
light
fruity
banana
aromas
along
with
a
crisp
clean
tart
lemon
aroma
taste
follows
the
nose
with
night
crisp
clean
lemon
tartness
and
some
light
wheat
and
banana
flavors
to
compliment
mouthfeel
is
thin
crisp
light
refreshing
with
high

for

use
too
o
really
good
i
was
left
wanting
just
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
department
overall
though
its
a
great
representation
of
the
style
meow
beer
o
tart
lemony
at
times
outright
sour
its
what
i
expected
in
my
first
shot
at
this
style
its
got
that
classic
chasethedragon
thing
going
where
you
taste
almost
all
sour
but
just
a
hint
of
sweet
then
as
time
passes
after
a
drink
your
mouth
starts
watering
and
you
instinctively
start
reaching
for
another
sip
to
quench
your
thirst
and
look
for
more
of
that
tantalizing
sweet
more
of
a
summerhot
weather
style
and
its
chilly
out
but
i
needed
a
break
from
big
hops
and
big
stouts
and
this
is
doing
the
trick
fresh
this
is
a
great
beer
locally
i
stumbled
across
a
stash
that
was
610
years
old
nobody
knew
for
sure
and
they
were
really
amazing
brews
tart
light
sparkling
and
super
drinkable
o
not
quite
what
i
expected
in
my
first
berliner
weisse
as
the
tart
is
fairly
mild
in
comparison
to
the
standard
in
the
style
however
this
is
an
excellent
tasty
very
refreshing
beer
that
i
could
go
back
to
over
and
over
again

9
oz
bottle
into
a

o
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
of
this
style
although
it
is
much
less
tart
than
many
others
i
have
tried
probably
a
good
choice
for
those
new
to
the
style
or
sour
flavored
styles
in
general
like
goses
lambics
flemish

american

etc
this

this
is
a
well

with
great

and
seems
to
hit
all
the
marks
for
the

i
prefer
hottenroth
a

but
this
one
is
much
easier
to
find
on
the
shelves
florida
overall
this
one
is
exceptionally
good
and
a
fantastic

i
highly
recommend
it
and
cant

to
get
more
cloudy

backed
by
mild

and
biscuit
light
bodied
with
medium

near
perfect
example
of
the
style
this
beer
reminds
me
why
i
love
this
style
its
the
perfect
thing
to
drink
on
a
summer
afternoon
clean
and
crisp
with
just
a
hint
of
lemon
and
acidity
to
take
the
edge
off
very
nice
o
out
of
the
berliner
weissbiers
ive
rated
not
a
single
one
has
scored
higher
than
a
3
from
me
this
though
is
actually
quite
solid
beers
like
these
are
exactly
why
i
never
give
up
on
a
style
i
dislike
this
would
also
make
a
great
introduction
to
those
whove
never
had
the
style
before
my
beer
guru
brought
this
one
over
to
split
ourstanding
appearance
very
good
smell
and
unreal
taste
would
describe
it
as
a
sour
but
lighter
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
clean
on
the
finish
i
really
wish
we
could
get
more
of
this
style
here
in
maryland
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
provides
a
very
unique
and
different
spin
on
what
flavors
can
be
found
in
beer
i
highly
recommend
just
wish
this
could
be
found
more
easily
in
maryland
ive
never
seen
it
anywhere
a
truly
great
ale
that
anyone
would
be
privileged
to
enjoy
cheers
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
sour
lemons
and
wheat
tastes
great
will
be
a
great
choice
for
in
the
summer
o
not
my
style
of
beer
but
nicely
done
probably
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
so
far
its
more
dynamic
than
the
others
but
with
less
lacto
presence
pours
a
golden
opague
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
to
more
or
less
a
lacing
of
head
around
the
top
smell
of
light
hay
with
zest
first
taste
has
a
bright
lemon
sourness
that
is
washed
away
by
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
clean
dry
finish
a
pleasant
funk
lightly
lingers
in
the
back
end
a
great
example
of
the
style
total
3750
overall
solid
beer
but
this
berlinner
weisse
does
not
have
that
level
of
cheesygreek
yogert
funkiness
that
you
get
from
the
lactobacillus
it
does
have
saison
like
qualities
and
its
still
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
it
is
a
beer
thats
definately
worthy
of
revisit
during
the
heat
of
the
summer
hot
weather
session
beer
for
sure
also
a
great
consideration
as
a
entry
level
berlinner
weisse
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
this
specific
beer
style
this
pours
light
straw
and
translucent
a
thick
fine
bubble
head
slowly
retreats
to
a
minimal
rim
no
laces
it
takes
a
while
to
settle
excellent
clarity
the
smell
is
mainly
dusty
grain
with
a
little
sourness
the
taste
however
is
very
different
fairly
tart
with
a
light
malt
presence
minor
notes
of
white
grapes
oak
and
wheat
high
carbonation
light
body
and
mostly
smooth
this
is
a
great
summer
time
and
or
lunch
ale
i
highly
recommend
this
ale
if
you
are
a
fan
if
sours
tall
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
nothing
with
no
lacing
cloudy
straw
yellowlemonade
color
smell
is
lactic
acid
lemon
and
bready
and
the
taste
mostly
follows
this
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
a
nice
example
of
the
berliner
weisse
style
this
is
a
dry
refreshing
slightly
lemony
beer
which
would
be
an
excellent
lawn
mower
beer
definitely
worth
trying
more
jobs
for
lactobacilli
this
would
make
for
an
excellent
summer
drink
but
its
really
not
my
preferred
style
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
wheaty
fairly
sour
crisp
and
refreshing
has
good
character
and
makes
for
an
enjoyable
drink
though
in
the
depths
of
winter
at
the
time
of
this
writing
it
makes
me
yearn
for
a
few
of
these
in
a
cooler
outside
in
the
summer
this
is
a
berliner
weissea
sour
wheat
bear
that
used
to
be
in
the
1800s
the
most
popular
beer
in
northern
germany
syrups
are
sometimes
added
to
this
style
of
beer
to
cut
the
sourness
napoleon
himself
praised
this
beer
as
the
champagne
of
the
north
its
a
cross
between
champagne
and
beer
sharp
rather
tart
and
very
very
bubbly
the
citrus
is
light
and
delicious
a
greatand
funsummer
drink
sip
dont
gulp
this
one
i
love
berliner
weisses
and
have
been
actively
seeking
them
out
and
decided
it
was
time
i
revisit
this
brew
id
first
had
about
a
year
ago
i
have
to
say
that
others
in
the
style
that
ive
tried
recently
have
been
a
bit
more
interesting
on
the
tongue
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
and
could
drink
plenty
of
it
during
the
summer
months
especially
overall
excellent
beer
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
put
it
up
there
with
any
unflavored
berliner
weisse
that
ive
tried
i
would
definitely
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
massive
billowy
white
cloud
head
that
overflows
the
glass
luckily
it
dissipates
pretty
quickly
aromas
of
granny
smith
apples
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
taste
begins
with
some
mouth
puckering
green
apple
then
a
hint
of
grain
and
finishes
with
a
dry
grassy
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
overall
a
fantastic
berliner
weiss
i
wish
we
got
more
of
these
over
here
overall
if
you
think
berliner
weiss
you
think
this
beer
beer
is
with
carbonation
of
high
intensity
leading
to
a
very
fizzy
painfully
so
ultrafoamy
mouthfeel
thats
just
too
much
for
the
style
and
the
beer
itself
as
well
closes
semidry
with
light
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
poured
into
a
beer
flute
the
white
champagnelike
head
gradually
dissipates
leaving
minimal
lacing
the
hazygolden
color
is
maybe
a
little
on
the
dark
side
for
what
is
supposed
to
be
a
lighter
style
of
weissbier
aromas
of
lemon
and
wheat
abound
with
hints
of
yeast
wonderful
flavor
like
a
glass
of
fizzy
lemonade
nice
lactic
character
but
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
with
its
aciditymaking
it
quite
quaffable
on
a
hot
day
it
is
light
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
bubbly
mouthfeel
slightly
heftier
than
most
berliner
weisse
though
i
really
do
like
this
beer
despite
its
high
alcohol
content
for
its
style
berliner
weisse
should
be
closer
to
2
53
0
abv
but
alas
disregarding
style
characteristics
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
sour
wheat
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
interested
in
the
style
as
it
is
easier
to
find
and
better
than
34
of
the
usproduced
berliner
weisse
o
this
is
pleasant
but
more
acidity
would
be
nice
i
realize
that
the
trend
nowadays
with
berliners
is
a
light
hand
with
the
bacteria
but
this
is
lighter
than
most
o
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
berliner
weissbiers
but
i
do
like
the
style
and
this
probably
the
best
one
ive
had
in
the
style
pours
an
extremely
cloudy
light
yellowstraw
color
with
a
huge
head
that
recedes
quickly
smell
was
more
subtle
than
i
expected
but
i
picked
up
some
wheat
lemon
and
clove
in
the
taste
theres
also
the
wheat
lemon
and
clove
and
it
is
sour
and
tart
as
the
style
dictates
the
5
abv
is
actually
high
for
the
style
and
the
crispness
from
the
high
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
produce
a
bit
of
bite
in
the
mouthfeel
but
the
thin
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
nice
late
summer
choice
for
being
as
thin
as
it
is
the
mouthfeel
worked
quite
well
and
the
high
carbonation
was
everything
but
distracting
overall
im
not
experienced
in
the
style
and
so
i
dont
have
much
with
which
to
compare
this
its
simple
elegant
and
refreshing
if
youre
into
a
tart
beer
and
i
like
it
overall
absolutely
delicious
must
be
experienced
to
be
truly
understood
as
theres
nothing
quite
like
a
berliner
weisse
a
little
confusing
on
the
nose
since
it
lacked
the
sour
aroma
that
would
have
prevented
it
from
smelling
like
a
hefeweizen
overall
a
super
refreshing
tasty
beer
like
a
slightly
sour
hefeweizen
with
a
bit
less
banana
and
clove
sweetness
very
enjoyable
i
want
more
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
since
i
havent
really
had
a
berliner
weissbier
before
but
this
beer
is
awesome
has
a
light
acidity
that
makes
it
dry
and
refreshing
not
sweet
nor
bitter
just
very
pleasant
and
palatable
i
could
definitely
see
this
paired
with
chicken
or
maybe
even
fish
entrees
since
the
lightness
of
the
beer
would
enhance
without
competing
with
the
flavors
this
is
also
a
beer
i
would
be
comfortable
sharing
with
nonbeer
geekscraft
beer
novices
as
well
as
beer
snobs
i
could
see
how
some
more
experienced
beer
geeks
might
find
this
beer
a
bit
too
subtle
but
i
find
this
beer
to
be
extremely
well
crafted
light
body
with
high
carbonation
and
a
slightly
sour
feel
this
is
a
nice
traditional
beer
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
others
ive
had
and
definitely
not
as
tart
as
the
others
out
there
but
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
introduction
into
the
style
for
some
people
willing
to
expand
their
tastes
1809
is
a
very
nice
berlinerstyle
weissibier
although
i
havent
heard
of
many
berliners
reach
levels
of
5
abv
crazy
i
know
this
stuff
would
go
down
like
water
if
it
wasnt
for
the
explosively
prickly
mouth
feel
that
almost
forces
you
to
take
it
slow
at
first
certainly
not
bad
though
considering
you
can
get
this
almost
anywhere
o
3
75
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
months
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
wheat
beer
but
the
added
sournesstartness
makes
it
something
different
and
quite
a
bit
better
in
my
opinion
a
bit
pricey
at
616
9oz
bottle
but
something
ill
probably
come
back
to
one
or
two
more
times
before
the
hot
weather
subsides
my
first
try
with
berliner
weissbier
and
i
love
it
super
refreshing
o
delightful
my
first
berliner
weissbier
crisp
refreshing
nice
clean
aftertaste
this
was
not
terribly
complex
it
had
exceptional
balance
and
poise
well
turned
out
and
sparkling
vivacious
and
enlivening
a
terrific
beer
with
a
low
abv
that
is
the
perfect
thirst
quencher
for
a
hot
day
would
compliment
almost
any
food
o
a
good
beer
but
not
one
worth
hunting
down
i
prefer
the
american
bws
which
seem
to
be
a
bit
more
tart
i
like
this
beer
and
wish
to
try
more
in
the
style
this
is
refreshing
in
the
heat
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
almost
a
chunky
white
with
a
small
half
fingers
width
head
of
tiny
bubbles
that
fizzle
away
slowly
the
beers
head
leaves
a
lacing
of
thin
sheets
on
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
deeply
hazy
and
cloudy
with
plenty
of
bubbles
racing
up
through
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
clean
and
lightly
wheaty
with
a
very
light
hint
of
tartness
on
the
nose
the
smell
is
not
really
overpowering
and
is
quite
one
dimensional
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
lightly
tart
with
sweet
bready
wheat
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
tart
citric
lemonlime
which
quickly
moves
into
creamy
wheat
bread
flavors
and
then
wheat
flakes
the
finish
is
citric
lemon
tart
and
lively
like
sprite
in
the
mouth
with
and
the
aftertaste
is
light
to
nonexistent
with
just
a
touch
of
wheat
flakes
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
in
body
with
prickly
sodalike
carbonation
that
scrubs
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
full
of
acid
neutralizing
saliva
and
a
light
tingle
from
the
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
light
beer
that
is
thirst
quenching
but
begging
for
a
syrup
or
something
to
be
added
to
it
this
is
a
beautiful
canvas
beer
to
be
experimented
with
and
is
refreshing
to
drink
but
rather
one
dimensional
i
think
it
is
great
that
they
are
recreating
this
style
with
historical
accuracy
but
personally
i
think
this
beer
needs
something
to
add
some
zing
to
the
taste
a
great
beer
to
add
things
too
o
what
an
interesting
beer
the
sour
notes
and
minerality
are
lively
and
enjoyable
overall
good
but
not
amazing
while
its
not
completely
true
to
style
its
one
of
the
better
easily
available
berliner
options
out
there
o
i
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
berliner
weisse
in
germany
so
while
i
cant
vouch
for
the
authenticity
of
this
beer
i
can
say
this
is
about
as
spot
on
a
berliner
as
i
could
imagine
tart
but
not
sour
with
a
strong
lemony
taste
well
done
o
this
is
a
weird
style
of
beer
its
hard
to
rate
because
i
cant
compare
it
to
anything
but
pickles
and
malt
vinegar
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
leaves
a
dry
sticky
feeling
in
the
mouth
with
a
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
after
two
disappointing
berliner
weissbiers
i
found
this
one
which
i
like
quite
a
bit
had
very
pleasent
citrusy
tartness
didnt
hit
you
in
the
jaw
like
a
lambic
but
had
a
nice
sour
taste
highly
carbonated
and
refreshing
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
o
very
light
and
refreshing
less
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
but
still
extremely
good
i
would
drink
this
for
hours
during
the
summer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
54
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
lemon
hops
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
and
slight
herbs
fits
the
style
of
a
berliner
weissbier
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
there
is
also
an
appropriate
level
of
tartness
tastes
of
lemon
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
slight
sugar
hint
of
herbs
and
a
hint
of
hops
overall
good
appearance
aroma
and
blend
my
scores
were
based
on
the
pure
nonsyruped
drink
for
reference
i
also
used
a
nonstandard
passion
fruit
concentrate
but
even
generous
amounts
of
it
did
not
mitigate
the
overwhelming
lactic
character
again
it
was
expected
but
too
evident
on
this
beer
it
helped
the
appearance
though
as
i
could
finally
see
a
white
neck
just
for
a
few
seconds
a
very
mild
and
refreshing
beer
overall
this
one
feels
authentic
simple
clean
not
overdone
in
any
way
the
taste
is
perfectly
simple
refreshing
and
delicious
with
a
little
tweaking
on
the
carbonation
this
could
be
a
perfect
summer
beer
overall
this
was
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
it
just
tasted
like
a
boring
fizzy
wheat
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
tartness
ill
conclude
that
i
prefer
the
modern
american
berliners
with
a
more
robust
lacto
component
than
this
traditional
berliner
o
a
nice
easy
drinker
that
has
a
nice
lactic
quality
and
a
solid
wheat
presence
great
for
a
summer
anytime
beer
o
like
it
and
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
enjoy
this
rather
like
a
lambic
refreshing
crisp
unique
love
the
bottle
that
has
lots
of
writing
on
it
love
the
history
it
gives
on
the
beer
overall
a
very
quality
beer
as
noted
its
refreshing
enough
that
i
could
see
myself
kicking
back
several
out
in
the
sun
on
a
lazy
weekend
drinkable
and
pleasant
poured
from
tap
at
avenue
pub
nola
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
little
bit
of
white
foamy
head
great
hefe
banana
and
clove
aromas
with
a
nice
dose
of
sour
taste
is
fantastic
banana
hefe
wheat
with
a
burst
of
sour
finishes
with
a
chocolate
like
note
and
smooth
its
amazing
how
the
tartness
just
finishes
out
leaving
the
maly
characteristics
behind
really
a
fantastic
brew
o
this
is
everything
you
want
from
a
german
beer
it
is
simple
and
easy
to
drink
yet
full
of
flavor
the
slight
but
not
overwhelming
tartness
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
gueuze
this
is
one
you
could
drink
all
summer
long
while
sitting
out
on
the
porch
and
enjoying
the
sun
overall
i
like
it
drinkability
is
the
biggest
factor
i
can
drink
this
with
or
without
food
a
no
fuss
refreshing
beer
one
of
the
best
bw
styles
ive
had
tart
flavors
as
well
the
lemon
is
more
of
a
persimmon
on
the
tongue
white
grape
hints
of
pine
very
green
this
beer
drinks
remarkably
well
even
though
it
does
have
a
tartness
that
some
may
not
favor
very
nice
overall
quite
good
while
i
do
not
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
them
i
really
like
the
berliner
weisse
style
and
this
strikes
me
as
quite
a
good
one
infinitely
drinkable
great
next
to
a
slice
of
pizza
othis
is
a
solid
aboveaverage
berliner
the
whole
package
was
nicely
balanced
in
terms
of
feel
and
flavor
but
nothing
jumped
out
and
made
me
say
wow
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
sour
beers
for
the
uninitiated
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
standard
berliner
nothing
crazy
added
like
so
many
of
the
floridaweisses
around
now
but
very
solid
overall
finally
satified
my
curiosity
about
one
of
the
last
styles
i
havent
tried
no
doubt
this
is
the
real
stuff
a
couple
of
us
brewed
attempts
i
had
were
just
watery
and
bland
by
comparison
this
is
extremely
refreshing
and
would
be
better
than
lemonade
on
a
summer
day
i
know
beer
snobs
recoil
at
the
idea
of
putting
syrup
in
beer
but
i
made
my
own
woodruff
syrup
and
a
couple
spoonfulls
really
tied
things
together
after
i
wrote
the
review
above
wouldnt
drink
this
again
without
the
syrup
o
refreshing
beer
was
expecting
more
tart
or
sourness
but
very
little
is
present
a
very
true
to
style
berliner
weiss
here
pours
cloudy
lemon
colored
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
fades
out
after
just
a
minute
or
two
the
smell
is
very
sour
and
citrusy
acidic
for
sure
and
refreshing
there
is
a
lot
of
lemon
in
the
flavor
tart
like
lemon
juice
from
concentrate
and
the
wheat
malt
does
little
to
calm
that
down
there
is
also
a
funk
sort
of
yeast
almost
saisony
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
too
its
got
more
carbonation
than
the
appearance
shows
and
the
body
is
super
light
the
acidity
at
the
end
is
a
little
harsh
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
be
just
right
its
not
one
of
those
beers
id
want
to
get
drunk
on
though
too
much
acidity
would
turn
the
stomach
around
it
is
a
very
refreshing
berliner
though
one
of
the
better
versions
ive
had
really
and
for
under
7
bucks
a
bottle
its
a
nice
buy
solid
and
nice
to
have
a
bottled
berliner
around
when
i
have
a
craving
for
one
but
better
examples
exist
overall
this
beer
is
a
never
fail
shot
to
get
a
nice
tart
bite
with
some
flavors
minus
the
funk
that
you
might
find
in
a
gueuze
really
helps
scratch
that
itch
when
i
dont
want
to
drop
12
on
a
bottle
of
black
label
or
open
something
from
the
cellar
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
got
it
because
ive
been
wanting
to
try
one
and
because
of
the
good
reviews
definitely
not
disappointed
and
would
love
to
seek
more
of
these
out
and
ive
seen
some
random
ones
popping
up
at
domestic
breweries
i
just
really
appreciate
all
the
flavors
that
come
through
in
this
despite
the
sour
twang
which
sometimes
tends
to
overpower
for
me
on
the
palate
its
a
mix
of
tart
and
sweet
not
overly
sour
but
a
nice
bit
of
lemony
pucker
and
healthy
dose
of
juicy
fruit
sweetness
alongside
light
in
the
body
and
quite
refreshing
overall
a
nice
slightly
tart
beliner
that
makes
for
a
nice
quick
sour
fix
without
palate
busting
kick
out
of
other
sour
styles
o
a
very
nice
berliner
incredibly
easy
drinking
extremely
crisp
and
refreshing
with
just
a
spot
of
lactic
sourness
a
tasty
little
treat
o
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
may
be
the
perfect
warm
weather
beer
best
ive
had
of
the
style
professor
fritz
briem
1809
berliner
weisse
is
good
beer
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
am
enjoying
this
bottle
is
it
the
worlds
best
representation
of
the
style
it
could
be
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
one
to
try
out
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
note
i
reviewed
this
beer
straight
from
the
bottle
though
i
also
tried
it
both
with
himbeer
syrup
and
waldmeister
syrup
the
traditional
manner
it
was
excellent
with
both
quite
enjoyable
i
would
drink
it
on
the
regular
a
spritely
lively
beer
light
and
zesty
in
character
a
great
beer
for
warm
weather
patio
or
biergarten
lounging
big
fan
of
this
beer
fizzy
overflow
upon
popping
the
cap
big
ol
white
head
sits
atop
a
liberally
carbonated
hazy
yellow
body
hard
to
fault
the
appearance
of
this
one
stunning
in
a
curvy
hefe
glass
with
a
an
even
pancake
of
a
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
long
haul
has
the
musty
sort
of
lactic
aroma
associated
with
many
wheatbelgian
styles
its
citric
and
theres
an
aromatic
sandalwood
type
smell
the
carbonation
jolts
my
throat
flavor
is
subtle
but
refreshing
light
bodied
lemony
tart
and
dry
nice
id
give
it
an
83100
overall
a
drinkable
refreshing
beer
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
pricey
at
11
bucks
a
bottle
but
its
definitely
a
great
summertime
treat
o
a
bit
thick
and
wheaty
for
a
berliner
weisse
but
still
quite
nice
drink
took
a
long
time
to
finally
see
one
of
these
bottles
and
its
a
damn
fine
beer
clean
crisp
refreshing
ill
have
to
get
another
1809
berliner
weisse
pours
am
opaque
light
yellow
with
about
two
fingers
of
white
foam
crowning
the
beer
the
head
hangs
out
for
a
minute
or
two
before
fading
cleanly
down
the
glass
the
nose
has
some
nice
citric
acidity
theres
also
a
musty
earthy
almost
mushroomlike
aroma
present
that
as
someone
whos
not
fond
of
mushrooms
im
not
crazy
about
the
citrus
is
more
prominent
flavor
wise
a
bright
note
of
lemon
juice
thats
not
too
tart
theres
a
distinct
grainy
wheat
flavor
there
too
and
that
earthy
musty
quality
is
a
bit
more
muted
and
has
lost
some
of
its
mushroom
edge
the
body
is
nice
and
light
but
i
think
the
carbonation
could
stand
to
be
just
a
little
more
lively
i
havent
necessarily
been
a
fan
of
most
of
the
berliner
weisses
ive
had
in
the
past
but
this
is
definitely
a
great
one
and
a
beer
id
welcome
in
my
glass
again
im
quickly
getting
into
the
berlinerweisse
style
and
this
is
a
big
reason
why
a
simple
yet
almost
flawless
beer
crisp
refreshing
balanced
and
super
drinkable
hard
not
to
like
this
one
tried
this
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
nice
beer
i
would
have
expected
more
tartness
out
of
this
the
lemon
comes
through
huge
and
ends
up
being
more
of
a
lemon
hefeweizen
more
then
anything
else
no
funk
but
some
sour
from
the
lemon
flavor
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
yeast
hanging
around

notes
poured
into
a

pokal
pours
a
medium
cloudy
yelloworange
lively
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
taste
is
wheat
light
fruit
and
lemon
weizen
spicing
sour
with
citrus
flavors
interacting
with
carbonation
light
wheat
in
the
middle
and
sour
lemon
finish
refreshing
flavor
a
bit
sour
for
me
but
to
style
and
i
still
enjoyed
this
well
made
weizen
o
this
was
incredibly
refreshing
given
the
circumstances
that
was
a
major
selling
point
i
would
gladly
buy
another
bottle
the
warmer
and
longer
it
sits
the
more
tart
the
lemon
gets
making
this
even
better
imo
this
is
how
a
bw
should
appear
smell
and
taste
highly
recommended
this
is
a
must
try
for
likers
of
the
style
t
the
flavor
opens
gradually
and
moves
towards
a
medium
lacticlemony
twang
some
green
apple
light
funk
and
wheat
on
the
finish
probably
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style

o
a
really
nice

that
is
easy

definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
and
start
seeking
out
more
berliner
weissbiers

i
havent
had
many
chances
to
grab
an
authentic
berliner
so
i
snapped
this
up
light

good

smells
tart
lemon
wheat
flavor
was
wheat
cracker
very
subtle
lemon
so
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
could
kill
a
lot
of
these
if
given
the
chance
solid
beer
cheers
o
a
nice
offering
refreshing
on
these
hot
summer
days
o
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
a
warm
spring
or
summer
day
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
tart
i
can
see
me
getting
into
berliner
weisss
pours
a
light
golden
straw
color
moderately
hazy
prickly
white
bubbles
scent
leads
with
a
touch
of
lactic
tartness
follows
up
with
light
fruit
such
as
apple
and
citrus
faintly
musty
dried
grain
taste
brings
moderate
lactic
tartness
a
nice
bit
of
tart
apple
grape
lemon
musty
dried
grain
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
refreshing
a
nice
berliner
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
some
toned
down
tartness
sampled
the
last
few
ounces
with
woodruff
very
nice
o
super
great
summer
beer
best
berliner
ive
ever
had
definitely
pick
up
a
couple
bottles
if
you
see
it
o
easy
drinker
especially
on
a
hot
day
good
for
a
few
o
its
a
good
beer
but
its
not
a
good
berliner
weisse
o
awesome
beer
glad
i
was
able
to
find
a
bottle
will
probably
pick
one
up
everytime
i
see
it
overall
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
and
it
invites
you
to
keep
drinking
more
o
this
is
beyond
any
berliner
ive
come
across
this
is
just
magnificent
in
all
aspects
o
this
is
a
solid
berliner
weiss
that
is
oh
so
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
could
easily
see
downing
two
or
three
of
these
o
so
this
is
what
a
real
berliner
weisse
should
taste
like
i
like
it
much
better
than
dfhs
neo
berliner
weisse
festina
peche
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
with
with
a
nontraditional
flavor
thought
i
read
it
is
usually
served
with
a
sweet
syrup
will
drink
again
maybe
with
a
little
fowl
a
very
good
wessbier
that
was
surprisingly
funky
pours
a
clouded
light
grainy
yellow
with
a
loose
vibrant
three
fingers
of
white
foam
this
falls
over
5
or
so
minutes
to
leave
a
solid
sheet
lots
of
funky
brett
on
the
nose
with
some
wheat
and
yeast
and
peppercorn
notes
dont
really
anticipate
sourness
very
lightly
tart
with
a
solidly
wheaty
flavor
and
some
hints
of
metal
the
brett
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
lactic
acid
there
are
plenty
of
subtle
tones
in
the
beer
and
i
would
hesitate
to
put
syrup
in
this
one
as
its
fairly
refreshing
as
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
hi
carb
and
semi
dry
finish
nice
beer
better
than
last
time
just

overall
nice
beer
but
i
have
to
admit
im
a
little
underwhealmed
i
think
br
tartare
has
ruined
me
forever
as
far
as
this
style
goes
solid
example
of
the
style
one
that
everyone
should
try
verdict
light
simple
sour
excellent
berliner
wiesse
and
one
i
can
find
almost
anywhere
at
nearly
5
abv
it
could
actually
be
called
an
imperial
berliner
weisse
as
most
beers
in
this
style
hang
around
the
2
to
3
mark
this
is
a
superb
looking
beer
a
pale
whitegolden
color
with
a
large
head
that
retains
for
days
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
sour
the
taste
is
good
its
got
a
nice
wellbalanced
tartness
that
is
rather
quaffable
fruit
flavors
and
a
touch
of
yeast
and
wheat
provide
a
supporting
role
very
wellcomposed
if
not
fascinating
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
beer
quite
this
fizzy
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
its
a
solid
introduction
to
the
berliner
weisse
its
not
quite
as
interesting
as
some
of
the
things
that
florida
breweries
are
doing
with
the
style
but
remains
a
great
reference
point
for
those
who
are
interested

there
is
a

as
well
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
and
refreshing
beer
and
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
tried
so
far
o
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
it
it
brings
in
a
lot
of
flavors
and
goes
down
easily
a
well
crafted
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
look
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
refreshing
tastes
kind
of
like
a
sour
lemon
drop
but
the
tartness
never
becomes
overwhelming
very
nice
on
a
warm
day
overall
a
very
tasty
berlinerweisse
fairly
complex
highly
drinkable
good
balance
o
this
is
a
go
to
berlinner
its
widely
available
and
is
just
fantastic
it
may
not
be
elite
but
for
the
price
and
the
availability
do
it
this
is
not
something
i
could
have
on
a
regular
basis
it
seems
like
it
would
be
a
very
interesting
conversation
piece
if
it
were
to
be
served
at
a
social
gathering
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
leaving
it
in
the
glass
for
a
little
bit
seems
to
let
this
open
up
much
better
dry
white
wine
really
begins
to
take
over
o
very
different
and
excellent
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
it
i
think
this
would
be
even
better
on
a
hot
day
in
the
summertime
o
such
a
refreshing
beer
lightly
tart
good
carbonation
and
light
body
a
really
delightful
style
and
one
id
love
to
have
much
more
of
o
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
would
have
been
interesting
to
sample
this
with
the
red
and
green
syrups
as
well
as
on
its
own
like
i
did
when
i
was
in
berlin
last
fall
very
refreshing
and
very
sessionable
easy
to
drink
in
the
cold
or
in
the
heat
would
easily
pair
with
lots
of
different
foods
mvery
light
and
refreshing
i
am
brewing
this
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
heat
of
summer
cant
wait
overall
delicious
quenching
refreshing
one
of
my
favorites
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
wish
more
breweries
were
doing
a
berliner
weiss
hopefully
they
will
be
soon
1809
is
fantastic
oa
great
take
on
a
sour
beer
has
definitely
become
one
of
my
staples
whenever
i
can
find
one
o
so
its
been
that
long
since
ive
been
here
that
drinkability
now
starts
with
an
o
but
yeah
this
is
a
delicious
stand
out
beer
that
deserves
a
place
in
every
serious
beerdrinkers
fridge
its
challenging
to
dissect
but
also
a
pleasure
to
drink
berliner
weissbier
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
unfortunately
it
is
all
too
rare
so
when
i
was
picking
up
a
few
bottles
for
a
friend
i
couldnt
resist
grabbing
this
bottle
as
soon
as
i
noticed
it
for
myself
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
5
abv
seemed
a
bit
high
but
now
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
overall
this
was
a
great
berliner
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
amount
of
sour
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
amazing
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
initially
sharp
and
acidic
with
a
bit
of
musty
damp
cellarlike
aroma
a
bit
grainy
with
some
tart
yeasty
aromas
apples
white
grapes
and
hay
nice
complex
aroma
taste
is
just
slightly
astringent
with
lovely
green
apple
and
grape
flavors
somewhat
champagnelike
perfect
amount
of
tartness
for
this
style
puts
festina
peche
to
shame
up
there
with
hottenroth
a
bit
of
clove
and
banana
with
wheat
and
grain
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
with
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
not
typically
the
right
weather
to
be
drinking
such
a
beer
but
damn
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
outstanding
beer
o
really
good
example
of
the
style
its
no
limbic
but
its
really
tasty
and
certainly
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
had
and
one
of
the
most
affordable
and
price
appropriate
a
bright
sweet
tart
and
refreshing
love
it
a
highly
refreshing
and
relaxing
beer
this
could
easily
be
a
sessionable
beer
for
one
to
take
their
time
drinking
the
character
develops
with
time
rather
than
progressing
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
it
is
extremely
refreshing
its
very
light
and
crisp
which
combined
with
the
slight
tartness
and
higher
carbonation
give
the
beer
an
excellent
pleasant
bite
it
was
very
enjoyable
early
on
a
saturday
afternoon
when
it
was
about
34
degrees
outside
my
guess
is
that
its
even
better
when
enjoyed
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
notes
light
in
body
with
a
very
soft
mouthfeel
this
is
one
thirstquenching
brew
almost
like
a
lambicwild
ale
yet
without
the
brett
funk
remarkably
easy
to
drink
as
i
will
be
seeking
this
beer
out
again
in
the
warmer
months
to
come
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
great
deal
the
complex
flavors
and
supreme
drinkability
had
the
two
of
us
thinking
a
day
after
brewing
our
first
batch
when
we
ought
to
brew
a
berliner
weiss
notes
highly
quaffable
with
dynamic
flavors
and
a
pleasant
complex
acidity
balanced
and
well
put
together
makes
me
wish
more
berliners
were
made

days

sure
this

overall
a
nice

id
like
to
try
again
and
seek
some
more
examples
of
overall
this

tart
refreshing
easy
to
drink
wheat

sourness
lends
as
great
deal
of
palette
interest
and
the
light
bodyhigh
carbonation
reinforce
the
crispness
my
first
example
of
the
style
but
id
say
its
very
well
done
o
a
great
beer
for
a
light
meal
or
on
a
hot
day
overall
very
interesting
almost
like
a
mix
of
a
dry
champagne
and
sugarless
european
citrus
soda
with
some
wheat
grounding
it
in
beer
territory
while
i
am
willing
to
try
this
style
again
i
found
the
dry
sourness
to
be
a
bit
intense
luckily
i
was
able
to
pair
this
with
some
food
baked
salmon
but
i
do
not
think
i
would
drink
this
without
food
o
im
not
all
that
familiar
with
berliner
weisse
as
a
style
but
i
would
venture
to
say
that
this
is
a
solid
example
of
what
a
traditional
berliner
weisse
is
supposed
to
be
i
enjoyed
the
elegant
character
of
this
ale
but
im
not
sure
that
i
would
be
all
that
keen
on
revisiting
this
one
until
ive
tried
some
other
berliner
weissbiers
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer

overall
a
really
awesome
beer
that
i
love
to
keep
around

house
its

its
pretty
easy

anything
else

say

it

highly

by

highly
drinkable
considering
tastes
like

the

is
very

i
find

wasnt
really
thinking
itd
be
like
that
but
it
was
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
also
a
little
tart
but
subtle
they
offered
some
woodruff
syrup
to
add
into
the
brew
and
i
found
that
to
be
interesting
i
liked
the
beer
more
with
the
syrup
which
is
probably
frowned
upon
by
some
people
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
refreshing
overall
the
beer
was
refreshing
the
tartness
was
tolerable
and
would
probably
be
most
enjoyed
on
hot
days
knapp85may

but
i
prefer
consuming
it
with
food
where
the
acidity
can

would

well
with

the
head
appeared
to
consume
itself
before
setting
as
a
light
white
lacing
around
the
edges
of
my
snifter
its
probably
the
clearest
berliner
weiss
ive
seen
to
date
the
aroma
is
of
light
yeast
with
the
lightest
of
tartness
it
definitely
isnt
as
aromatic
as
the
other
berliners
ive
had
the
flavor
is
very
subtle
and
very
light
it
gives
off
slightly

this
is
all

barley
and
yeast
with
virtually
no
hops
the
appearance
is
hazy
with
gold
color
and
a
nice
head
the
flavor
is
sour
but
not
overly
so
and
very
much
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
but
just
right
overall
its
close
to
being
good
notes
from
and
tasted
on
61207
this
was
a
more
citrusy
and
carbonated
brew
as
apposed
to
the
bayerischer
berliner
which
was
more
bready
and
smoother
they
both
were
good
though
d
this
is
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
it
is
extremely
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
brew
all
night
long
recommended
d
quite
an
excellent
beer
the
perky
character
of
the
style
is
nice
to
enjoy
and
the
lower
abv
makes
this
very
easy
to
do
dive
had
festina
peche
but
this
is
my
first
real
berliner
when
i
tried
brooklynschneider
i
imagined
a
real
berliner
to
taste
like
this
this
is
exactly
what
i
expected
and
it
is
very
gooda
style
i
wish
more
brewers
would
pick
up
the
acidity
gets
to
ya
after
a
little
bit
but
its
one
i
would
definately
trade
for
again
my
first
berliner
weisse
im
a
fan
too
bad
this
was
exceptionally
expensive
12
50
for
a
0
5l
bottle
from
toronado
i
wish
this
was
more
widely
available
a
great
refreshing
light
bodied
beer
drinkability
the
crispness
from
the
carbonation
and
the
tartness
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
light
and
refreshing
for
sour
beer
lovers
this
is
a
must
try
if
i
can
find
this
again
it
will
most
definitely
make
its
way
into
my
shopping
cart
tartsour
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
sweet
theres
a
fruitiness
that
makes
this
one
not
need
the
fruit
syrup
that
modern
interpretations
of
the
style
often
have
perhaps
a
bit
too
acidic
and
tart
to
drink
all
day
long
pours
a
peachyyellow
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
falls
off
after
a
short
while
somewhat
cloudy
laces
brokenly
smells
of
lactic
sourness
wheat
gooseberries
alcohol
taste
is
mostly
a
thin
wheaty
flavor
up
front
with
a
distinct
tartness
and
growing
sour
quality
alcohol
present
too
which
i
find
surprising
and
out
of
character
for
the
style
ethanol
actually
distracts
from
the
flavor
and
reduces
the
complexity
of
the
sour
flavors
didnt
have
any
syrup
to
add
so
i
wasnt
able
to
see
how
it
improved
the
beer
but
i
feel
like
even
a
b
w
should
be
reviewed
based
on
how
it
tastes
straight
thin
bodied
kind
of
watery
ive
had
a
few
berliner
weisses
and
this
has
been
both
the
least
interesting
and
the
least
palatable
drinkability
if
you
dont
mind
the
tartness
this
is
a
refreshing
easily
drinkable
beer
authentic
and
true
poured
a
16
9oz
bottle
into
my
unibroue
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
2
inch
white
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
what
reminds
me
of
sweet
tarts
definite
sour
notes
with
a
little
grain
and
just
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
sour
wheat
malt
it
seems
to
me
to
be
really
1
dimensional
just
tart
with
a
bit
of
what
reminds
me
of
green
veggies
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
while
drinkable
i
find
it
just
a
little
to
tart
for
a
beer
thats
not
a
sour
this
beer
gets
more
drinkable
everytime
i
try
it
mmmm
wish
i
saw
it
available
more
often
d
for
a
sour
beer
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
still
not
one
that
i
have
all
the
time

from
ledgers
liquors
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hazy
gold
with
a
large
white
head
expectedly
fizzy
due
to
the
sourness
aroma
is
wheaty
banana
with
a
meringue
note
flavor
is
raw
tart
lemonade
with
wheaty
maltiness
and
banana
esters
some
apple
a
touch
of
clove
very
drinkable
and
crisp
d
this
brew
was
decent
enough
but
in
the
end
it
was
a
little
bland
and
boring
its
uniqueness
lies
in
the
sourness
which
doesnt
hold
my
interest
very
long
while
very
refreshing
and
crisp
it
doesnt
do
much
to
engage
the
senses
though
it
isnt
mild
enough
to
sip
on
all
night
very
nice
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
an
authentic
german
version
of
the
style
this
will
have
to
go
into
my
regular
summer
rotation
its
a
shame
the
end
of
the
season
is
coming
soon
overall
very
unusual
beer
but
highly
enjoyable
they
said
on
the
bottle
it
is
mash
hopped
and
uses
no
wort
boil
strange
i
think
im
a
fan
of
the
style
now
overall
it
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
think
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
no
problem
prost

drink
extremely
easy
im
definitely
happy
living
in

but
all
700
of
berlins

century
weissbier
breweries
probably
made
a
compelling
argument
that
life
was
certainly
worth
living
before
electricity
the
label
claims
napoleon
and
his
troops
called
this
style
lively
and
elegant
it
has
a

gives
off

fading
into

sticky

wonderfully
bold
acidity

flavors
kind
of
like

light
in

overall
not
bad
but
not
what
i
expected
little
watery
decent
sour
and
more
toasty

o
overall
i
enjoyed
it
very
soft
and
subtle
recommended
only
because
im
not
sure
what
it
cost
anything
over
9
and
im
not
sure
its
a
good
value
misses
style
only
slightly
very
refreshing
brew
for
a
hot
winter
day
o
this
had
all
the
components
for
a
great
berliner
except
for
the
one
that
is
arguably
most
important
taste
ill
give
jk
a
pass
as
this
is
the
most
disappointing
ive
had
but
still
not
bad
a
little
above
average
overall
ill
try
again
next
year
if
released
again
but
wont
trade
my
life
away
to
obtain
it
big
thanks
goes
out
to
funkydelic
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
past
random
sunday
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
lemon
citrus
tart
sour
and
lemon
rine
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
citrus
earth
hop
spice
bell
pepper
and
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
upon
taking
in
the
aroma
i
was
thinking
that
i
was
in
for
something
special
however
the
flavor
was
a
little
bit
lacking
as
compared
to
the
aroma
while
it
was
still
good
it
just
didnt
have
quite
the
amount
of
complexity
and
acidity
that
i
got
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
was
a
good
bit
more
earthy
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
finally
try
this
one
and
wouldnt
mind
doing
so
again
in
the
future
to
see
how
it
develops
over
time
very
light
and
thin
with
a
weak
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
in
seconds
almost
no
smell
with
just
a
whiff
of
maybe
something
has
turned
in
the
fridge
even
the
flavor
of
rare
cant
help
this
one
water
with
a
touch
of
plain
yogurt
and
powdered
vitamin
c
o
funky
acidic
and
citrus
with
a
sweet
bready
finish
o
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
rated
it
higher
than
i
would
because
the
last
one
i
had
was
so
much
more
sour
either
way
its
a
fun
beer
to
have
i
just
prefer
it
to
be
more
sour
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
but
it
is
definitely
lacking
the
tartness
that
i
was
expecting
its
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
a
wheat
beer
and
a
berliner
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
light
and
easy
drinking
but
displays
just
a
bit
too
much
focus
on
malt
and
not
enough
tartness
the
residual
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
and
it
overall
is
lacking
the
tartness
and
crisp
snap
to
the
finish
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
as
a
summertime
beer
it
is
fitting
and
something
i
could
throw
back
pretty
effortlessly
but
considering
the
trouble
getting
it
and
the
price
tag
there
are
others
out
there
i
would
opt
for
instead
of
this
one
o
great
session
beer
i
enjoy
austin
beerworks
einhorn
a
little
better
but
this
hit
the
spot
for
an
after
work
predinner
drink
i
apologize
for
how
hard
this
is
to
describe
but
i
realllly
wanna
find
some
more
like
this
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
is
a
really
polarizing
beer
though
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
jk
pretty
solid
brew
all
around
glad
i
tried
it
edit
tried
this
on
tap
at
jester
king
in
early
12
and
it
was
much
better
gave
it
a
45
as
a
had
though
im
not
the
most
experienced
in
berliners
this
was
just
boring
and
lacked
a
lot
o
very
light
refreshing
great
beer
for
the
warm
weather
o
another
solid
offering
from
jk
liked
this
one
a
lot
carbonation
might
come
up
a
little
more
with
bottle
conditioning
but
that
is
one
of
my
only
knocks
on
it
o
all
around
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
to
a
hot
august
day
please
make
this
many
more
times
jester
king
o
not
a
style
i
have
a
ton
of
familiarity
with
but
i
found
this
very
enjoyable
great
evident
sourness
but
not
completely
mouth
puckering
wish
this
was
available
in
4
or
6
packs
rather
than
750s
this
is
a
great
beer
and
an
even
greater
summer
beer
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
for
an
enjoyable
and
refreshing
drinking
experience
o
another
fantastic
job
by
jester
king
bonnie
the
rare
is
well
done
the
beer
is
truly
in
the
style
of
a
berliner
weiss
has
all
the
characteristics
of
that
style
there
is
an
interesting
play
going
on
between
the
tart
citrus
flavors
and
the
malt
with
the
tartness
winning
out
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
delight

out
of
a
can
before
i
might
have
to
pick
some
of
these
up
for
the
summer
if
they
arent
too
expensive
overall
a
splendid
example
of
the
style
should
go
well
if
you
prefer
to
add
a
dash
of
himbeer
or
waldmeister
syrup
o
a
bit
of
an
underwhelming
sour
especially
at
this
rice
point
one
dimensional
towards
the
tartness
with
only
the
mild
breakfast
cereal
character
giving
any
complexity
could
definitely
stand
some
increased
esters
or
funk
that
said
its
an
easy
drinker
and
the
six
pack
shouldnt
last
long
as
the
days
get
warmer
very

salty

made
my
mouth
pucker
up
a
bit
harsher
acidity
than
id
like
a
touch
of
dms
creamed
corn
in
aroma
and
flavor
overall
if
you
enjoy
exceptionally
tart
and
quenching
berlinner
weisse
this
beer
is
for
you
the
sourness
was
outstanding
and
perfectly
pucker
but
also
quite
drinkable
pretty
much
fell
in
love
o
an
impressive
weisse

from

what

it
was
so
loud
that
it
awakened
all
of
the
little
critters
on
my
kitchen
the

hopes
that
the
kitten
was
not
aroused
what
was
aroused
was
the

the

of

holy

i
cant
unpucker
my
lips
and
i
am
supposed
to
play
the
trumpet
tonight
my
duck
face
is
not
of
my
own
free
will
finish
was
dry
puckering
and
everything
that
was
intended
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
a
berliner
weiss
and
i
think
it
would
make
for
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
time
this
beer
has
nice
drinkability
its
smooth
a
little
refreshing
a
little
acidic
a
little
crisp
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
the
acidity
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
just
a
nice
true
example
of
the
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
i
wish
the
head
and
lacing
were
better
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
sour
beer
and
especially
if
you
like
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
just
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
and
i
think
its
nice
that
more
breweries
are
making
this
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
evil
twin
beers
ive
had
and
i
think
its
above
average
for
the
style
good
job
guys
this
is
a
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
keep
up
the
hard
work
very
sour
like
an
unflavored
lambic
i
dont
detect
any
wheat
whatsoever
in
the
flavor
lip
smackingly
sourlong
lasting
aftertaste
but
not
necessarily
pleasant
very
soda
like
and
thin
on
the
body
almost
feels
like
water
if
not
for
some
noticable
hints
from
the
wheat
and
berliner
influence
kind
of
a
berlinersoda
hybrid
almost
strong
sour
tones
really
biting
with
a
sharp
lemon
influence
grabbed
a
can
at
astoria
bier
cheese
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
no

its
fruity
and
tart
with
an
earth
bitterness
the
fruit
tastes
like
a
mix
of
cherry
and
banana
with
lemon
squeezed
for
the
sour
tang

a

the
beer
does
not
explode
out
of
the
glass
but
it
is
supremely
drinkable
and
addicting
o
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
that
would
lend
to
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
why
drink
beer
with
no
flavor
when
you
can
drink
this
evil
twin
is
a
hit
or
miss
this
one
a
miss
tasty
berliner
basically
like
a
tart
lemonade
flavor
had
side
by
side
with
bu
weisse
couldnt
hold
up
to
that
but
still
nice
this
was
really
enjoyable
the
tartness
was
just
right
and
had
a
nice
funk
i
would
have
this
beer
again
in
a
heartbeat
the
taste
is
very
good
some
lactic
qualities
that
bring
to
mind
lemony
juicy
flavor
with
some
wheat
to
add
sweetness
with
light
funk
and
mild
brinyrindlike
tropical
fruity
flavor
with
some
mild
sweetness
in
general
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sour
wheat
ale
witth
tangy
fruit
with
easy
to
drink
strength
i
like
this
canned
berliner
recommended
the
feel
is
refreshing
even
with
the
acidic
nature
not
harsh
to
drink
at
all
the
body
is
a
little
stronger
than
the
light
soft
texture
it
should
display
but
not
overdone
much
it
keeps
up
a
good
dryness
on
the
palate
even
with
the
juiciness
m
mediumlow
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
and
mostly
stylistically
appropriate
berliner
weisse
its
solid
but
just
a
little
lacking
could
be
a
bit
more
crisp
and
the
carbonation
is
there
but
fairly
low
for
the
style
as
far
as
this
being
a
berliner
weisse
im
not
that
sure
it
taste
an
awful
lot
like
a
westbrook
gose
variation
than
a
true
berliner
weisse
i
know
westbrook
brewed
this
beer
for
evil
twin
and
westbrook
is
one
of
my
favorite
regional
breweries
but
they
didnt
try
too
hard
to
make
it
different
from
their
gose
all
that
being
said
i
still
like
this
beer
as
a
gose
and
rated
it
as
such
very
good
berliner
i
could
drink
this
everyday
if
i
could
i
would
buy
this
quite
often
sets
a
standard
of
its
own
odd
with
the
sushirice
tastes
which
make
it
just
an
average
brew
i
probably
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
sour
tang
but
i
cant
really
find
too
much
wrong
with
this
beer
it
just
doesnt
excite
me
at
its
price
point
probably
one
six
pack
is
enough
for
purchase

sourness
refreshes
the
palate
with
ease
and
provides
a
light
body
and
crisp
texture
with
a
quick
echo
of
wheat
bread
the
beer
dissolves
from
the

with
utter

its
a
masterful
taste
with
powerful
sourness
that
never
lingers
or
fatigues
the
palate
perfect
for
hot
summer
days
i
wish
this
was
one
of
those
enjoyed
this
straight
and
as
such
its
an
ok
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
with
some
syrup
im
surprised
at
the
amount
of
mediocre
reviews
fantastic
take
on
a
bw
especially
if
you
like
em
with
heavy
lacto
and
very
sour
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
but
again
hits
the
style
on
the
head
and
has
terrific
smell
feel
and
taste
from
top
to
bottom
a
big
thanks
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
lemons
grains
taste
is
tart
lemons
grains
a
bit
funky
finishes
dry
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
the
nomader
wit
that
was
a
bit
boring
but
this
one
is
not
without
its
flaws
either
a
real
quick
lacto
kettle
sour
on
the
nose
funky
and
apple
forward
just
sour
enough
in
the
aroma
the
wheat
malt
feels
heavy
even
in
this
really
light
beer
and
the
stinky
souring
process
is
not
matured
out
of
this
beer
its
gross
to
those
who
are
unaware
how
these
beers
are
made
i
get
a
green
apple
character
in
here
that
im
not
all
the
way
in
love
with
and
a
heavier
feel
because
its
so
cloudy
and
raw
the
carbonation
is
also
below
average
for
the
style
i
like
these
to
be
a
bit
brighter
in
that
aspect
so
this
one
was
a
weird
beer
a
session
style
that
i
only
want
one
of
not
too
often
that
happens

abv
beer
overall
this
is
your
typical
berliner
weissbier
it
actually
is
nice
because
it
sheds
things
down
to
the
bare
bones
there
is
no
gimmick
and
there
is
no
hook
the
beer
presents
itself
solely
offering
a
serious
take
on
a
rare
style
despite
the
grapey
fruity
and
tart
suggestions
from
the
nose
you
get
hit
with
that
bright
bittering
pucker
in
the
flavoring
that
you
might
not
be
expecting
this
acts
to
both
surprise
and
cleanse
the
palate
making
way
for
this
beer
and
nothing
but
this
beer
nomader
weisse
supports
a
pleasant
philosophy
one
of
sharpness
cleanliness
and
relaxation
this
is
a
philosophy
that
is
easy
to
get
behind
and
you
can
hopefully
truly
see
where
theyre
coming
from
once
you
sample
this
beverage
they
hit
the
style
well
and
make
the
decision
to
revisit
this
beer
an
easy
one
pour
is
clear
cold
with
a
dense
puffy
white
head
nose
is
heavy
candied
lemon
and
sugar
with
a
hint
of
wheat
and
lacto
taste
follows

overly
sweet
lots
of
candied
lemon
a
bit
of
grain
and
a
light
metallic
finish
syrupy
body
softer
carb
fleshy
feel
one
of
the
best
berliner
weisses
ive
had
not
quite
sure
why
the
score
isnt
higher
for
my
taste
this
is
right
up
there
with
bahnhof
poured
from
a
can
into
an
euler
stange
poured
a
light
straw
amber
with
golden
tint
and
a
half
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
little
trace
aroma
of
lemon
citrus
with
light
wheat
a
hint
of
funk
flavor
follows
quite
lemony
and
tart
with
hints
of
wheat
tapering
off
quickly
to
lemon
rind
and
lemon
extract
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
despite
the
lackluster
head
a
good
lemony
berliner
weissbier
that
left
me
wishing
for
a
bit
more
wheat
character
refreshing
and
moderate
tart
not
my
style
but
a
pleasant
refreshing
summer
beer
i
appreciate
the
restrained
sourness
a
very
tasty
and
thirst
quenching
berliner
very
middleoftheroad
this
berliner
really
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
maybe
itd
be
a
good
candidate
for
imparting
some
fruit
overall
nice
tartness
but
theres
an
offflavor
in
here
that
i
dont
love
something
about
that
dankish
sweetness
that
said
there
is
a
tartly
refreshing
element
here
which
i
do
like
o
not
the
best
berliner
i
have
tried
but
i
am
very
happy
that
i
was
able
to
pick
this
up
nose
is
fairly
weak
but
the
taste
is
not
o
different
styles
but
mikkeller
won
this
round
of
first
can
releases
whoops
i
forgot
about
hipster
but
i
havent
had
that
so
they
are
at
least
the
first
cans
for
me
from
the
respective
brewers
a
let
down
and
i
was
excited
to
be
having
another
berliner
weisse
the
label
art
is
pretty
bland
and
boring
as
well
pale
cloudy
blond
with
a
rapidly
dissipating
head
pretty
standard
berliner
appearance
nose
is
largely
lactic
and
lemony
decent
enough
though
theres
a
rubbery
off
note
that
im
not
particularly
thrilled
by
the
palate
doesnt
differ
a
lot
from
the
aroma
moderate
lacto
some
spiciness
some
bicycle
tire
its
hard
to
get
past
that
note
of
rubber
it
isnt
overt
but
its
just
noticeable
enough
that
the
beer
is
hard
to
enjoy
o
overall
a
good
berliner
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
like
the
nose
a
little
bit
better
than
the
taste
but
both
have
lots
of
lemon
and
some
sourness
to
them
and
are
good
worth
checking
out
a
refreshing
beer
to
drink
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
hazy
gold
color
taste
is
hard
for
me
as
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
but
it
is
fairly
sour
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
finish
mild
aroma
not
much
lacing
and
a
head
that
leaves
pretty
quickly
it
was
nice
to
find
a
single
in
a
can
as
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
style
hazy
yellow
gold
with
an
attractive
pillow
of
white
foam
on
top
leaving
behind
sticky
lacing
light
lactic
aroma
lemon
and
creamy
grainy
wheat
refreshingly
tart
flavor
with
some
lemon
and
a
slight
metallic
twinge
i
wish
the
wheat
spoke
up
more
to
compliment
the
sour
very
drinkable
dry
and
crisp
straightforward
but
good
too
expensive
to
drink
in
large
quantities
unfortunately
o
just
enough
tartness
to
keep
me
wanting
to
drink
it
and
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
here
in
nc
tastes
authentic
to
the
style
and
definitely
one
that
i
would
get
again
nice
light
mouthfeel
and
extremely
well
hidden
alcohol
considering
it
is
on
the
higher
end
for
the
style
a
fine
berliner
weiss
normally
im
not
a
fan
of
sour
or
fruit
beers
my
husband
ordered
this
at
a
local
gastro
pub
and
decided
he
didnt
like
it
as
someone
who
hates
to
see
beer
go
to
waste
i
decided
to
finish
it
up
for
him
surprisingly
i
actually
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
open
the
first
taste
you
get
a
bit
of
dry
sourness
but
then
it
turns
into
a
round
juicy
flavor
that
i
rather
enjoyed
i
might
need
to
rethink
sour
beers
now
a
rather
forgettable
beer
not
very
good
not
very
bad
drinkability
a
sour
cidery
beer
without
much
blueberry
flavor
wow
i
have
had
my
eyes
on
this
beer
for
a
while
and
someone
recently
recommended
it
to
me
boy
am
i
glad
i
finally
tried
it
tons
of
blueberry
flavor
not
something
i
expected
at
all
very
sour
and
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sours
but
i
thought
the
blueberry
taste
would
make
it
a
sweeter
more
palatable
beer
not
my
favorite
berliner
weiss
style
very
sweet
tastes
like
smarties
i
commend
evil
twin
for
getting
an
authentic
fairly
strong
blueberry
flavor
into
a
beer
but
for
me
it
seems
like
there
is
a
divide
between
the
fruit
and
the
berliner
and
they
dont
ever
find
a
complete
marriage
raul
recommended
lots
of
peeps
be
all
like
waaaaa
not
enough
blueberry
blah
blah
blah
well
too
bad
chock
full
of
tart
blueberry
flavor
bub
super
tasty
pretty
pink

too
that
make
all
the
ladies
go
ohhhh
look
at
that
manly
man
drinking
a
pink
beer
waz
his

almost
drinks
like
a
cider
with
that
yummy
lacto

would
drink
again
pour
is
a
dark
copper
with
a
ruby
hue
and
a
lot
of
off
white
head
nose
is
fleshy
and
meaty
blueberry
followed
by
a
dirty

a
lot
of
sugars
and
a

of
lime
taste
is
hot
fake
meaty

dirty

o
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
try
but
i
was
hoping
for
much
more
blueberry
than
i
got
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
for
anyone
that
enjoys
the
style

im
a

nearly
perfect
summertime
aperitif
i
found
this
to
be
a
refreshing
beer
nice
high
carbonation
suits
the
flavours
well
overall
simply
dreadful
packaging
but
the
beer
was
fairly
nice
o
this
was
more
like
a
gueze
than
a
berliner
weiss
the
blueberries
are
barley
noticeable
in
this
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
otherwise
just
ok
smelled
tart
sweet
and
slight
like
blueberries
taste
at
first
was
very
tart
whith
a
solid
sweettart
blueberry
taste
to
it
at
first
it
was
a
little
less
tart
than
i
hoped
for
until
i
poured
the
rest
of
the
bottle
into
my
cup
with
all
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
that
kicked
it
up
a
notch
and
was
much
more
mouth
puckering
tarty
with
sour
blueberry
tones
solid
berliner
and
would
like
to
drink
again
super
drinkability
if
this
wasnt
so
bloody
expensive
id
drink
this
all
summer
not
100
married
to
the
style
but
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
and
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
expect
it
poured
a
hazy
purple
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
and
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
funky
blend
of
lemon
blueberries
and
yeast
mouth
was
light
and
refreshing
there
is
no
coating
effect
and
the
flavor
aside
from
the
bite
only
lasts
as
long
as
the
sip
the
flavor
is
quite
tart
and
acidic
lots
of
lemon
even
more
so
than
the
blueberries
of
which
there
are
an
abundance
of
virtually
no
alcohol
bite
and
absolutely
no
malt
this
is
different
not
sure
its
my
cup
of
tea
but
refreshing
and
interesting
none
the
less
22
ounce
bottle

pours
slightly
hazy
deep
orange
copper
color
with
a
12
finger
fairly
dense
light
pink
head
with
solid
retention
that
reduces
to
ring
of

slight
spotty

all
around

and
very

to

a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
i
totes
paid
13
for
a
bottle
of
carbonated
blueberry
water
oh
well
at
least
it
has
justin
bieber
on
it
wait
thats
not
justin
bieber
on
the
bottle
what
the
fuuuck
dies
overall
its
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
in
a
warm
sunny
day
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
do
recommend
trying
it
out
but
dont
get
the
bomber
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
this
style
very
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
d
this
was
an
ok
berliner
weisse
but
no
blueberry
was
noticeable
it
was
more
like
a
subpar
gueuze
with
an
uninteresting
scent
and
taste
and
body
the
finish
was
a
bit
harsh
too
so
must
be
sipped
age
may
help
but
this
was
really
not
worth
buying
in
the
first
place
pours
a
blueberry
almost
blood
orange
hue
with
a
creamy
three
finger
and
some
considerable
clingy
lacing
very
nice
lookingthe
smell
is
like
blueberry
pie
with
a
nice
sourness
aswellthe
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
and
has
tastes
of
sour
blueberriestart
wheat
and
finished
like
a
sour
ribena
just
full
of
blueberries
and
overall
yes
i
love
this
and
would
buy
again
fans
of
farmhouse
ales
and
all
of
their
close
cousins
will
enjoy
o
the
blueberries
add
a
great
little
contrast
dont
turn
your
nose
up
at
it
or
write
it
off
as
a
gimmick
this
is
a
seriously
tasty
and
refreshing
quaff
i
dare
these
guys
to
sixpack
this
in
the
summer
overall
this
beer
was
above
average
but
pretty
one
note
very
puckering
with
nothing
to
balance
the
flavors
at
all
not
the
best
sour
beer
ive
had
o
this
is
my
first
berliner
weissbier
so
i
dont
have
much
reference
to
compare
it
except
for
sours
and
goses
from
which
ive
already
had
westbrooks
gose
and
this
feels
much
more
subtle
in
terms
of
tartiness
not
sure
if
i
would
call
it
a
summer
beer
but
i
can
imagine
being
a
great
entree
beer
for
a
night
of
seafood
and
shrimp
cocktails
bottle
from
gator
beverage
pours
pinkish
purplish
red
hazy
with
a
on
finger
pink
fluffy
and
spritzy
head
aroma
of
good
lord
what
the
hell
is
this
straight
vinegar
and
maybe
some
nail
polish
remover
really
awful
honestly
flavor
is
some
blueberry
up
front
sourness
very
light
flavor
and
rather
watered
down
finishes
with
some
metallic
blueberry
skin
lingering
wheaty
sourness
on
the
palate
meh
extremely
light
bodied
with
very
high
carbonation
this
has
no
redeeming
qualities
drainpour
city
overall
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
beer
is
a
great
reflection
of
what
the
style
should
be
however
was
hoping
for
stronger
berry
flavors
on
the
taste
and
aroma
cheers
o
its
not
that
its
offensive
or
anything
but
this
doesnt
even
approach
some
of
the
truly
good
berliners
or
sours
around
im
feeling
let
down
by
this
one
not
tart
enough
nor
enough
fruit
i
havent
had
too
many
berliners
to
say
if
this
is
to
style
or
not
but
i
enjoyed
it
didnt
get
much
blueberry
but
has
a
nice
lactic
feel
and
sourness
id
drink
this
again
overall
a
very
good
fruited
version
of
a
berliner
this
one
is
somewhere
in
between
a
berliner
and
a
fruited
lambic
as
far
as
flavor
and
tartness
goes
its
worth
a
try
even
if
a
little
expensive
for
what
youre
getting
hard
to
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
what
a
great
blueberry
sour
pink
and
cloudy
in
color
without
much
head
true
to
limbic
in
looks
the
nose
is
really
lactic
and
tart
more
acid
than
berries
over
a
wheat
malt
base
it
seems
vinegary
from
the
nose
and
the
flavor
follows
that
sour
all
the
way
into
my
jaw
i
really
love
the
flavor
the
blueberries
come
out
a
lot
more
in
the
finish
than
at
first
even
after
the
swallow
and
they
blend
well
with
a
biscuity
cookie
malt
finish
sour
as
they
come
this
is
a
puckery
beer
to
say
the
least
i
would
like
a
little
more
blueberry
through
the
beer
but
i
understand
most
of
their
flavor
is
sugars
that
are
fermented
out
in
the
brew
brightly
carbonated
this
beer
really
pops
maybe
too
acidic
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
splitting
a
bomber
with
a
friend
is
a
good
dose
cool
beer
from
evil
twin
with
a
great
comical
label
o
an
unbalance
sour
with
a
decent
amount
of
berry
flavors
i
enjoy
the
assertive
tartness
even
it
gets
a
bit
out
hand
pours
a
cloudy
orangepink
color
13
inch
head
of
an
slightly
pink
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
fruits
floral
hint
of
tartness
slight
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
and
some
astringency
fits
the
style
of
a
berliner
weissbier
mouth
feel
is
tart
dry
sharp
and
crisp
there
is
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
citrus
slight
sweet
malt
sour
notes
hint
of
hop
and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
overall
very
good
beer
good
appearance
aroma
body
and
complexity
at
4
5
it
is
quaffable
balanced
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
with
a
real
nice
wheat
base
to
it
blueberry
is
authentic
and
doesnt
come
across
to
fake
or
sweet
i
feel
as
though
it
is
more
than
appropriate
that
evil
twins
justin
blåbær
elicits
the
same
sort
of
affecting
charming
fraught
aggressive
and
occasionally
wonderfully
dumbfounded
impressions
that
i
imagine
could
also
very
well
be
evoked
by
the
dating
of
selena
gomez
overall
this
might
be
my
favorite
bw
style
that
has
fruit
added
within
the
brewing
process
rather
than
as
a
syrup
afterwards
i
like
the
fact
that
it
is
fruity
but
maintains
that
tart
biting
mouthfeel
that
wakes
up
your
palate
its
probably
also
my
favorite
beer
out
of
the
few
ive
had
from
evil
twin
overall
i
wouldnt
know
justin
timberlake
from
the
back
street
boys
nor
do
i
want
to
but
this
is
one
enjoyable
beer
i
once
had
blabaer
fever
and
this
beer
cured
my
ails
meaning
i
no
longer
have
any
interest
in
tracking
this
one
down
after
having
it
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
and
is
full
of
quickly
disappearing
foam
theres
some
blueberryish
sentiment
that
settles
and
floats
at
the
bottom
which
trust
me
doesnt
make
much
scientific
sense
to
me
either
the
nose
is
pretty
flat
in
my
opinion
some
lemon
acidity
and
a
touch
of
that
berliner
wiesse
its
pretty
tart
and
sour
up
front
with
just
a
touch
of
those
blueberries
present
on
the
medium
part
of
the
swallow
and
they
disappear
quickly
i
really
wish
there
was
just
a
bit
more
of
that
fruit
component
in
the
flavor
the
beer
finishes
with
a
dry
biscuit
and
puckery
end
mouthfeel
its
nicely
carbonated
and
light
i
guess
i
just
expected
a
bit
more
in
terms
of
blueberry
its
a
pleasant
beer
and
not
too
funky
or
lactic
but
nothing
outstanding
either
the
flavor
has
a
distinct
fruity
taste
with
a
lot
of
wildyeast
and
lactic
tanginess
with
more
fruit
tartness
coming
forward
with
subtle
wheat
backing
up
the
bacteria
in
the
flavor
with
mild
fruit
skin
and
low
acid
in
the
middle
the
lemon
and
berry
cohesive
taste
is
impressive
i
find
myself
going
back
for
additional
tastes
as
there
is
a
mix
of
sweetness
left
on
the
palate
after
the
initial
tangy
almost
sour
flavor
subsides
this
is
a
great
beer
and
very
quenching
at
the
same
time
i
was
pleased
to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
bottle
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
berliner
weissbier
a
very
drinkable
quaffable
and
satisfyingly
great
sour
wheat
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
fire
orange
with
hints
of
pinkish
hues
topped
by
an
inch
of
fluffy
white
foam
that
settles
into
a
sparse
blanketing
within
a
minute
the
nose
has
huge
bready
notes
hints
of
tart
fruit
citrus
and
dog
spittle
the
taste
leaves
a
more
distinct
blueberry
impression
than
the
nose
but
the
heavy
yeast
presence
is
truly
the
highlight
of
this
beer
it
has
a
lightmedium
body
thats
characterized
as
being
bready
semidry
tart
fruity
and
finishes
with
a
potent
funkiness
that
lingers
i
definitely
think
this
beer
would
be
a
really
tasty
berliner
wo
the
fruit
but
the
blueberry
really
takes
this
beer
into
a
new
category
of
deliciousness
good
priceavailability
i
will
likely
get
again
pours
cloudy
a
bit
nose
is
very
mild
on
blueberries
flavor
is
kind
of
a
sour
blueberry
thing
the
blueberries
are
definitely
dominant
and
any
berliner
weisse
character
that
might
otherwise
be
here
is
blown
out
by
the
fruit
its
always
nice
to
pick
up
a
new
berliner
weisse
i
wouldnt
mind
one
with
a
bit
more
punch
on
it
though
theres
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
but
its
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
i
could
definitely
see
this
as
my
go
to
berliner
o
a
refreshing
and
quaffable
berliner
with
a
great
dose
of
blueberry
not
the
most
dominating
blueberry
beer
out
there
but
this
is
quite
good
overall
this
is
a
berliner
weisse
alright
continuing
to
remind
me
why
its
one
of
my
favorite
sour
styles
so
very
refreshing
thrilled
to
finally
get
a
chance
to
try
this
one
although
i
have
to
admit
i
might
be
more
thrilled
to
have
that
amazing
label
included
in
my
collection
overall
i
dont
get
much
blueberry
but
its
a
tasty
berliner
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
justin
blabaer
tasty
but
not
overpowering
the
berries
were
nicely
balanced
here
hazy
pinkish
color
with
a
ton
of
bubbly
whitishpink
head
no
real
collar
or
lacing
but
not
typical
for
this
style
anyway
taste
is
a
nice
refreshing
tartness
some
blueberry
and
a
touch
of
lemon
and
some
barnyard
funk
high
carbonation
and
light
body
really
great
brew
light
body
and
pleasantly
carbonated
very
refreshing
overall
despite
the
poor
bottle
art
which
turned
me
away
from
this
beer
a
few
times
i
finally
caved
for
the
try
and
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
an
excellent
sour
for
beginners
has
all
the
complex
flavors
berliner
weisses
promise
but
in
subtle
tones
would
buy
again
o
this
is
the
first
time
ive
actually
wanted
a
sour
beer
to
be
more
sour
the
fruit
in
it
is
very
nice
but
i
feel
it
could
be
accented
with
more
lactic
acid
just
seems
to
be
lacking
character
easy
to
drink
though
and
i
could
see
myself
knocking
back
plenty
on
a
hot
summer
day
one
could
say
its
an
entry
level
sour
the
flavor
follows
with
tart
and
sourness
in
the
front
and
then
it
moves
onto
a
grainy
malt
flavor
there
is
a
hint
of
blueberry
and
sweetness
with
a
clean
flavor
aftertaste
its
a
decent
beer
but
could
use
a
bit
more
of
an
interesting
punch
lots
of
carbonation
to
keep
the
beer
light
and
refreshing
pours
a
hazed
cherry
brown
hue
with
a
thin
pinkish
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
a
couple
sips
a
lot
of
barrel
funk
on
the
nose
cabernet
dried
hay
lemon
zest
and
a
faint
hint
of
bready
malt
a
lot
of
fruit
up
front
seems
like
its
going
to
be
sweeter
than
i
hoped
then
the
sour
funk
seeps
in
has
moments
of
an
oude
bruin
but
remains
much
more
tart
throughout
finishing
with
a
dry
and
bitter
mouthfeel
would
definitely
satisfy
any
lover
of
sourwild
ales
o
very
tasty
and
a
treat
to
drink
o
a
very
fun
beer
for
sour
beer
lovers

o
ive
also
had
it
from
the
bottle
and
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
either
one
its
good
but
i
wish
it
was
more
fruit
forward
cheers
the
beer
pours
like
watery
pink
grapefruit
juice
with
pink
and
pale
yellow
notes
and
a
lot
of
murkiness
the
beer
pours
with
a
small
head
of
fizzing
soda
bubbles
that
burst
away
into
nothing
in
body
this
beer
is
like
swamp
water
murky
opaque
and
possessing
a
couple
of
floating
particles
on
the
nose
the
beer
is
initially
yeastylike
a
bread
doughbut
then
the
fresh
fruit
breaks
through
on
the
nose
with
mashed
blueberries
slight
apple
skin
and
citric
lemon
and
lemongrass
with
a
touch
of
blueberry
pie
that
is
just
delicious
to
smell
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
lipsmackingly
tart
with
a
little
balancing
sweetness
from
the
wheat
malt
and
the
blueberry
fruit
citric
acid
is
huge
in
this
beer
and
puts
a
nice
pucker
on
the
lips
this
beer
is
puckering
and
tart
but
the
balance
is
enough
that
it
is
not
painful
and
gives
the
beer
some
wonderfully
refreshing
qualities
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
in
body
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
that
gives
way
to
a
little
bit
of
oiliness
on
the
finish
carbonation
tingles
nicely
over
the
tongue
at
a
rate
on
the
plus
side
of
medium
and
the
mouth
is
left
full
of
acidcanceling
saliva
in
flavor
the
beer
is
very
light
with
its
blueberry
character
the
beer
begins
as
sharp
citric
lemon
juice
slowly
moving
into
lemon
grass
with
a
touch
of
yogurt
which
is
rounded
out
by
sweet
blueberry
pie
with
some
nice
wheat
flake
flavors
moving
into
the
finish
the
finish
is
lighter
but
refreshing
with
a
last
burst
of
fruity
lemon
and
blueberry
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
with
wheat
malt
and
a
touch
of
yogurt
overall
this
is
an
american
weissefruited
weissemiami
weisse
that
is
closer
to
the
original
berliner
weisse
style
it
has
some
great
wheat
and
lacto
flavors
along
with
some
lovely
nuances
from
the
blueberries
this
is
a
great
beer
to
put
back
during
the
summer
unfortunately
is
was
just
released
by
me
and
it
is
distinctly
the
fall
now
crisp
refreshing
sessionable
and
delicious
a
great
weisse
to
try
at
the
low
abv
and
easy
drinkable
quality
this
is
a
very
accessible
yet
easy
drinking
blueberry
sour
blueberries
contain
just
the
right
tart
level
and
acidity
to
make
them
a
perfect
addition
to
sour
beers
and
i
really
wish
more
people
were
doing
things
with
it
rather
than
usually
going
for
cherries
or
currants
good
stuff
definitely
one
of
the
more
memorable
beers
ive
had
from
evil
twin
in
a
while
and
trust
me
its
not
just
because
of
the
label
poured
into
my
reissdorf
stange
appearance
is
purplishpink
with
a
dense
white
head
and
smells
of
grapes
lemon
zest
and
funk
upfront
the
taste
is
intensely
tart
but
quickly
evens
out
into
a
bright
funky
floral
berliner
with
a
bunch
of
fresh
blueberries
in
the
finish
nicely
carbonated
quite
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
not
regret
buying
this
again
decent
beer
would
drink
again
but
dont
know
if
its
worth
buying
after
the
bottle
is
forcefully
discarded
what
remains
in
the
beer
is
outstanding
the
beer
doesnt
get
in
the
fruits
way
and
the
fruit
doesnt
get
in
the
ales
way
and
this
creates
a
harmonious
blend
and
is
still
wellinfused
o
a
pretty
good
berliner
i
honestly
thought
it
tasted
more
like
a
straightup
fruit
beer
overall
a
nice
berliner
weisse
good
balance
of
flavors
and
decent
complexity
i
bet
the
barrel
aged
version
is
really
nice
im
sure
the
barrel
character
adds
a
lot
poured
into
snifter
pours
a
reddish
purple
with
a
bit
of
haze
not
much
head
with
a
vigorous
pour
no
retention
the
nose
starts
with
a
fresh
tart
wave
of
blueberry
followed
by
lemon
zest
wheat
and
some
acidic
notes
towards
the
end
the
taste
starts
just
like
the
nose
with
ripe
blueberries
paired
with
wheat
and
lemon
the
combination
of
flavors
are
seamlessly
integrated
and
makes
for
an
extremely
refreshing
drink
there
is
tartness
present
mid
palate
nothing
overwhelming
a
nice
note
of
citrusy
zest
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
a
delicious
berliner
that
is
very
refreshing
o
this
beer
isnt
as
sour
and
tart
compared
to
some
of
the
other
beers
in
this
style
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
this
would
probably
make
for
a
good
introduction
to
a
berliner
weissbier
for
someone
who
is
trying
the
style
for
the
first
time
the
beer
is
hazy
and
grapefruit
hued
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
offers
light
blueberries
pie
crust
subtle
funk
light
in
body
with
zesty
carbonation
simple
and
straightforward
mild
but
present
blueberry
character
with
a
delicate
blend
of
funk
and
fruit
sweetness
solid
overall
this
is
great
and
stupid
easy
to
drink
o
the
nose
is
lacking
a
bit
but
aside
from
that
its
a
nice
example
of
a
fruited
berliner
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
love
the
label
its
quite
hilarious
that
alone
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
count
me
a
belabaeri
mean
a
believer
nice
pinkish
cloudy
color
with
lots
of
head
an
amazing
aroma
of
sweetness
sourness
strawberries
and
especially
blueberries
an
inyourface
blueberry
explosion
of
sweet
alcohol
fine
mouthfeel
that
supports
but
does
not
overpower
the
flavors
just
a
superbly
done
and
tasty
beer
from
start
to
finish
yum
o
a
good
berliner
weisse
overall
simple
but
tart
a
little
sour
and
refreshing
i
would
like
a
little
more
depth
but
whats
there
is
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expectedprefer
for
the
style
slightly
tart
and
funky
with
a
subtle
blueberryvinous
dark
fruit
character
lingering
into
a
slightly
acetic
dry
finish
blueberries
are
there
but
not
as
prominent
as
in
the
nose
tastes
more
organic
than
cloyingly
sweet
or
artificial
a
nice
touch
of
fresh
berry
along
with
lactic
funk
bready
yeast
citrus
zest
and
acidity
a
light
and
refreshing
fruited
berliner
that
stays
true
to
style
without
becoming
overly
sweet
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
drinkable
refreshing
tasty
awesome

flavorful

i
am
very
interested
in
trying
the
original
evil
twin
version
for
comparison
o
lots
of
blueberries
a
touch
of
barrel
and
tartness
a
god
awful
label
o
i
love
the
label
the
appearance
and
the
nose
but
the
blueberries
are
severely
lacking
in
the
taste
even
still
its
all
kind
of
delicious
and
drinkable
so
pumped
i
was
able
to
find
this
on
a
shelf
m
lighter
side
of
medium
prickly
and
zesty
this
one
is
nice
carbonation
pop
giving
my
palate
a
workover
easy
and
delicate
drinkable
to
the
max
mild
blueberry
flavor
and
not
sweet
at
that
tart
slightly
acidic
and
a
bit
drying
light
funk
flavor
profile
that
scratches
where
i
itch
easy
beer
to
like
here
nice
work
i
want
more
and
my
wife
loved
it
as
well
the
hazy
pinkishred
liquid
that
comes
out
of
the
bottle
is
intriguing
and
not
just
because
of
the
ridiculous
name
and
bottle
the
beer
smells
strongly
of
blueberries
and
lacks
any
type
of
head
really
lingering
behind
in
the
aroma
is
some
tartness
and
blueberry
pie
crust
in
the
taste
theres
not
as
much
blueberry
as
i
was
expecting
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
actually
the
smell
had
me
a
little
worried
theres
just
enough
sweetness
and
a
nice
tartness
thats
mellowed
out
by
the
berries
nice
light
malt
backbone
true
to
the
berliner
style
and
good
carbonation
all
in
all
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
very
solid
berliner
weisse
o
overall
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
almost
a
drain
pour
because
the
nose
was
so
screwy
still
not
an
epic
fail
overall
despite
the
gimmicky
name
and
label
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
addition
of
the
blueberries
compliment
and
add
to
the
base
beer
perfectly
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
pours
a
murky
light
orangered
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
blueberry
and
other
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
only
slightly
sour
blueberry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
blueberry
presence
is
fairly
subdued
all
around
goofy
name
and
bottle
very
nice
sour
brew
i
might
just
grab
one
for
the
cellar
poured
into
a
warsteiner
pokal
pours

medium
caramel
amber
with
a
white
head
with
pinkish

that
dissipates
moderately
quickly
to
a
thick
film
no
lacing
aroma
is
raspberry
juice
and
not
much
else
similar
to
a
light
lambic
flavor
follows
with
very
light
biscuit
malt
berry
juice
faint
wheat
finishes
dry
with
some
light
berliner
weissbier
tartness
and
more
clearly
identifiable
blueberry
light
bodied
with
active
carbonation
a
nice
light
refreshing
fruit
beer
it
is
not
as
tart
and
lactic
as
a
traditional
berliner
which
is
actually
fine
with
me
but
might
bother
traditionalists
who
would
aviod
this
just
from
the
label
i
suspect
fun
to
drink
and
crazy
presention
but
one
of
the
things
i
like
about
evil
twin
is
that
they
sometimes
have
weird
names
and
presentations
but
most
of
the
time
the
beer
is
unusual
and
great
to
drink
this
is
one
of
those
odd
that
the
initial
berry
aroma
and
taste
is
closer
to
raspberries
than
blueberries
maybe
ill
have
it
again
at
a
sunday
brunch
outside
of
that
ill
stick
with
something
heartier
light
purple
pink
in
color
little
head
no
lacing
smells
like
a
berliner
weiss
mild
lactic
quality
mild
sulfur
and
a
hint
of
fruity
blueberry
taste
is
more
if
the
same
weak
blueberry
wheat
a
slight
lactic
tartness
light
sweetness
balanced
with
a
mild
sweetness
lighter
bodied
light
tartness
good
carbonation
o
solid
berliner
but
not
mind
blowing
certainly
worth
trying
and
i
appreciate
that
the
blueberry
flavor
while
light
is
not
artificial
tasting
like
many
blueberry
beers
very
good
berliner
not
very
sour
or
tart
but
solid
berliner
characteristics
and
enough
blueberry
to
notice
it
o
refreshing
inviting
great
berliner
weiss
with
blueberries
a
great
evil
twin
westbrook
cbx
collaboration
85100
high
b
o
incredibly
drinkable
and
delivers
on
the
tart
blueberry
flavor
o
a
nice
blueberry
beer
well
balanced
worth
price
would
like
to
pick
anything
bottle
d
its
a
wellcrafted
berliner
with
a
nice
accent
of
blueberry
to
it
a
tad
expensive
for
what
it
is
but
eminently
drinkable
and
enjoyable
looking
forward
to
trying
the
wine
barrelaged
version
odgreat
name
and
label
but
boy
the
beer
is
no
slouch
either
not
just
a
gimmick
this
is
one
of
the
best
berliners
i
have
had
love
the
blueberry
flavor
must
try
o
this
is
an
awesome
berliner
weissbier
it
fits
all
the
characteristics
of
a
good
berliner
plus
it
has
a
nearly
perfectlydone
blueberry
character
this
is
how
i
wish
all
fruit
beers
would
be
you
have
a
welldone
base
beer
that
is
made
better
by
the
subtle
addition
of
fresh
fruit
really
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
beer
drinker
but
especially
berliner
weissbier
fans
bonus
points
for
the
awesome
label
tart
blueberry
taste
some
crisp
lactic
sourness
clean
finish
with
a
little
bit
of
residual
fruit
skins
moderate
carbonation
a
little
bit
gassy
a
quick
swirl
brings
back
a
finger
of
foam
right
away
minerally
wheat
crisp
fruity
blueberry
is
distinctive
and
a
clear
common
thread
from
the
color
to
the
aroma
and
the
taste
even
the
lulzy
goofball
label
i
was
sold
when
i
saw
westbrook
on
the
label
and
this
one
is
legit
easy
drinking
tart
and
refreshing
the
blueberries
were
a
nice
touch
to
balance
everything
out
a
really
nice
berliner
o
really
awesome
berry
aroma
here
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
overly
frothy
and
there
could
be
more
acidity
though
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
on
the
blueberry
end
as
is
this
is
a
pretty
standard
berliner
with
a
touch
of
berry
added
pretty
good
beer
poured
a
cloudy
pink
with
minimal
head
and
lace
but
lots
of
carbonation
a
strong
blueberry
aroma
with
some
tart
and
sour
notes
as
well
i
find
the
beer
to
have
a
good
balance
between
sharp
sourness
and
lively
carbonation
and
both
funky
and
tart
blueberries
although
i
must
add
the
blueberries
give
off
a
touch
of
sweetness
at
times
easy
to
drink
with
a
light
body
ive
not
had
too
many
beers
of
this
style
but
this
one
is
a
keeper
verdict
very
nice
berliner
from
evil
twin
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
berliner
with
fruit
the
blueberry
comes
across
nicely
a
great
summer
beer
o
my
first
of
the
style
very
fruity
and
refreshing
just
enough
tartness
to
make
it
go
down
fast
o
its
basically
a
beer
version
of
grapefruit
juice
its
descent
but
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
o
on
the
whole
this
is
an
interesting
well
made
take
on
the
berliner
weissbier
style
definitely
drinkable
foggy
glowing
reddish
peach
color
with
a
very
small
fleeting
white
head
smell
is
plenty
of
blueberry
juice
tartness
and
freshly
cracked
grain
increased
fruity
tartness
in
the
mouth
but
far
from
any
sort
of
artificial
or
cloying
characteristics
blueberries
gentle
acidity
and
a
long
fresh
grainy
finish
dry
clean
mineral
and
puckering
in
the
mouth
seems
to
me
like
the
base
beer
would
hold
up
as
a
good
berliner
on
its
own
pretty
simple
but
it
stays
away
from
being
a
one
note
wonder
with
a
pleasant
complimentary
grainy
wheat
component
nicely
done
wish
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
o
pretty
awesome
more
would
be
very
welcome
o
ill
be
honest
i
got
this
because
it
made
me
laugh
when
i
first
heard
about
it
and
as
a
label
collector
this
one
is
a
must
have
that
being
said
who
wouldve
guessed
that
the
contents
would
be
so
spot
on
really
well
done
for
my
tastes
thanks
to
evil
twin
for
killing
it
on
the
inside
and
on
the
outside
on
this
one
o
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
light
and
refreshing
as
a
big
fan
of
the
berliner
weissbier
i
would
gladly
have
this
one
again
blueberry
is
a
good
seasonal
fruit
for
the
addition
to
the
style
light
bodied
and
lively
carbonated
but
not
quite
effervescent
this
is
one
of
the
most
blueberry
forward
brews
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
it
is
downright
crushable
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
as
far
as
berliners
go
this
one
at
times
feels
a
bit
watery
however
it
is
a
perfect
summertime
offering
that
i
am
nitpicking
here
could
use
a
bit
more
tartness
regardless
i
enjoyed
the
grain
backing
and
how
clean
this
was
i
want
more
this
is
an
incredible
beer
its
vibrant
bright
and
exciting
the
blueberries
zip
around
the
palate
and
the
wheat
helps
to
balance
this
juiciness
stopping
it
from
becoming
overly
fruity
the
tartness
in
the
back
is
gentle
and
gradual
not
too
sharp
its
so
refreshing
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
i
need
to
buy
more
o
im
not
hugely
into
the
style
but
this
is
almost
certainly
the
best
one
ive
had
im
still
waiting
for
one
with
the
big
sourness
that
i
hear
about
anyways
id
def
drink
this
one
again
which
is
actually
a
pretty
high
compliment
for
me
when
talking
about
a
berliner
weisse
a
collaboration
between
evil
twin
brewing
westbrook
brewing
co
the
charleston
beer
exchange
overall
an
exceptional
berliner
weiss
that
you
should
immediately
grab
if
you
see
one
love
it
o
overall
this
is
certainly
a
good
berliner
and
one
of
the
better
evil
twin
beers
that
ive
had
i
think
the
nose
is
fantastic
super
sour
super
fresh
and
some
light
funk
adding
complexity
it
might
sound
like
i
didnt
like
the
taste
which
is
not
the
case
the
taste
is
good
its
just
that
after
the
nose
this
beer
had
i
was
hoping
for
it
to
be
a
little
more
flavorful
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
can
get
a
bottle
and
id
certainly
have
it
again
overall
this
was
a
really
great
berliner
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
right
amount
of
tartness
o
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
i
had
this
just
a
few
days
after
hunahpu
day
where
i
tried
a
lot
of
great
berliners
from
funky
buddha
and
this
beer
is
definitely
on
par
with
a
lot
of
the
best
florida
berliners
i
had
only
had
big
stouts
from
evil
twin
before
so
it
was
also
cool
to
see
jeppe
do
such
a
different
style
and
to
totally
nail
it
this
is
a
great
beer
definitely
seek
this
out
aroma
of
citrus
zest
mango
peach
apricot
faint
honey
green
tea
taste
stone
fruit
mild
earthiness
shape
citrus
finish
nice
overall
this
just
is
not
my
style
i
may
have
to
try
a
more
traditional
berliner
wiessbier
to
ensure
it
just
wasnt
this
particular
flavor
but
this
was
too
sour
and
funky
for
me
i
rated
it
like
i
did
because
according
to
the
description
this
is
how
these
beers
are
supposed
to
be
well
if
thats
the
case
i
dont
like
them
but
i
didnt
want
my
personal
view
to
cloud
my
reviewing
judgement
drink
at
your
own
risk
overall
a
really
enjoyable
sour
fruit
berlinerweisse
would
drink
this
pretty
often
if
it
were
available
to
me
thanks
again
lambicpentameter
for
sending
this
one
my
way
better
than
the
reviews
imply
interesting
beer
and
i
did
enjoy
it
but
just
not
one
that
i
will
seek
out
again
the
beer
is
a
light
pink
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
collar
aromas
of
grassy
funk
herbal
tea
peach
peach
skin
kombucha
moderate
tartness
with
stone
fruit
and
a
mild
earthiness
some
floral
notes
with
a
hint
of
berries
the
finish
offers
a
light
puckering
sensation
with
a
moderate
acetic
quality
complex
and
enjoyable
the
peach
character
was
more
prominent
the
fist
time
i
had
this
and
nearly
absent
on
the
second
occasion
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
definitely
worth
a
try
d
definitely
not
true
to
style
but
delicious
with
the
addition
of
tea
which
adds
just
a
mild
amount
of
sweeter
floral
notes
to
the
nose
and
palate
extremely
drikable
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
very
good
with
lemony
tangy
and
gentle
tealike
herbal
flavors
with
light
wheat
in
the
middle
and
slight
toasted
grain
with
gentle
lactic
element
playing
nicely
with
the
tropical
tea
blend
with
a
nice
sour
finish
overall
i
really
liked
this
but
consider
it
a
great
berliner
with
subtlety
enough
sour
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
and
the
tea
adds
to
the
blend
of
tastes
well
flavor
is
much
he
same
despite
the
papaya
front
and
center
on
the
label
it
just
doesnt
come
across
still
as
a
hibiscus
berliner
its
pretty
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
light
bodied
crisp
and
tart
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
pucker
its
not
bad
just
was
hoping
for
more
tropical
fruit
and
complexity
flavor
starts
off
with
a
sharp
yet
light
tartness
as
expected
from
the
style
there
is
some
nice
fruity
tartness
and
sweetness
that
attempts
to
show
up
but
is
quite
mild
and
light
as
expected
the
tea
notes
seem
more
prominent
in
the
flavor
with
herbal
and
grassy
notes
mixed
in
with
the
tartness
yummy
and
refreshing
brew
the
tea
gives
the
brew
a
nice
dimension
even
though
everything
is
very
light
and
refreshing
a
rad
take
on
a
classic
berliner
tropical
fruit
all
through
it
but
ever
losing
its
lactic
sourness
or
bright
refreshing
carbonation
pink
tinted
murky
but
still
bright
because
of
the
bubbles
and
the
airy
white
head
it
has
a
nose
of
tart
tropical
fruit
maybe
passion
fruit
seeds
white
wheat
in
high
dose
and
a
familiar
lacto
profile
truer
to
the
style
here
at
its
base
than
many
american
incarnations
flavors
of
guava
and
papaya
come
up
in
the
middle
of
an
otherwise
very
classic
berliner
there
is
a
floral
element
sort
of
in
the
yeast
that
really
comes
out
in
the
finish
that
is
awesome
with
the
sourness
its
about
mid
scale
on
the
sour
spectrum
just
right
for
session
drinking
this
is
the
ultimate
summer
beer
this
year
i
think
and
at
under
10
bucks
a
bomber
its
super
reasonable
instead
of
adding
funny
fruit
or
botanical
syrups
to
the
berliner
i
like
this
with
the
fruit
added
for
me
its
in
perfect
proportion
not
too
sweet
different
enough
and
very
genuine
good
bubbles
light
body
but
frothy
in
feel
not
dumbed
down
dialed
in
even
by
perennials
high
standards
this
is
elegant
and
delicious
beer
sure
to
be
a
crowd
pleaser
peach
to
amber
in
color
with
a
bit
of
haziness
head
is
virtually
nonexistent
aroma
of
tropical
tea
with
a
hint
of
wheat
mango
and
passion
fruit
are
present
the
body
is
light
and
this
is
meant
to
be
fairly
drinkablebut
the
sweetness
prevents
that
from
happening
the
beer
pours
very
cloudy
was
a
little
turbid
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
felt
like
it
was
more
like
that
and
it
had
a
kind
of
creamyheavy
mouth
feel
because
they
used
real
peaches
in
the
brew
so
there
was
pulp
in
it
smelled
like
peaches
surprise
it
was
more
sour
than
any
other
berliner
weisse
ive
ever
had
and
it
lacked
a
funkyness
characteristic
that
i
get
when
i
drink
1809
so
i
dont
know
if
i
would
really
call
this
a
berliner
but
i
would
compare
it
more
to
pizza
boy
peach
funker
which
is
an
american
wild
because
of
the
sourness
and
mouth
feel
if
you
see
this
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
not
the
best
peach
sour
ive
had
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
overall
a
nice
light
drinkable
berliner
o
this
one
was
recommended
by
several
people
so
i
finally
caved
as
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
anything
sour
it
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
the
tart
lacto
was
much
more
subdued
than
is
normal
for
the
style
the
buttered
popcorn
and
candied
peach
really
complemented
each
other
nicely
i
thought
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
at
some
point
this
was
a
pretty
interesting
beer
ive
never
had
a
peach
beer
or
berliner
weiss
that
tasted
like
this
if
you
like
peaches
and
cream
id
say
seek
this
out
while
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
did
not
get
as
much
peach
as
i
would
have
liked
perhaps
the
overcarbonation
removed
some
of
the
peach
but
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
hazy
golden
orange
body
pours
into
a
chalice
with
great
effervescent
head
fine
speckled
bubbles
left
behind
as
it
settles
down
a
bit
aroma
has
pungent
acidity
chalky
yeast
notes
and
earthy
peach
pits
with
a
bit
of
flesh
evident
of
actual
fruit
flavor
just
think
very
tart
and
refreshing
peach
tea
tannin
notes
with
peach
pit
notes
and
dry
acidity
lactic
fruit
yogurt
maybe
a
chobani
dries
the
palate
from
every
direction
i
popped
some
nexium
earlier
and
im
glad
that
i
did
effervescent
well
done
carbonation
levels
carries
this
lively
tart
lower
abv
ale
across
my
palate
nicely
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
bone
dry
finish
overall
impressed
with
the
use
of
fruit
so
subtle
where
they
used
loads
of
real
peaches
in
a
classic
german
berliner
weisse
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
but
it
was
kind
of
a
let
down
didnt
pick
up
any
peach
flavor
more
traditional
style
with
less
sourness
and
more
wheat
favors
in
the
for
front
not
terrible
but
didnt
meet
expectations
the
peach
flavors
are
spectacular
the
base
berliner
weiss
is
fairly
tame
but
i
suppose
its
just
there
to
set
the
stage
for
the
peach
definitely
worth
a
try
its
mild
and
delicate
and
done
just
right
a
bit
off
to
style
but
its
delightful
and
the
peach
is
true
and
real
ill
take
another
overall
seemed
an
accurate
to
style
and
very
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
well
done
nice

a

dots

slide
quickly
back
into
the
beer
color
is
what
you
would
expect
blonde
hazy
pinkish
hues
just
like
a
ripe
peach
smells
like
a
ripe
peach
too
no
guessing
here
this
beer
is
what
it
claims
to
be
first
sip
is
undeniable
refreshing
fresh
peaches
medium
low
sourness
sweetness
from
the
peaches
soft
and
drinkable
great
beer
not
a
lot
of
depth
but
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
on
a
warm
summer
evening
thumbs
up
pour
is
pale
hazed

with
a
white

a

lots

with
a
strong

light

with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
good
i
served
this
on
a
wonderful
spring
easter
sunday
with
the
sun
ashining
and
70f
now
i
started
out
drinking
ipas
before
this
berliner
and
might
i
say
this
berliner
started
out
like
a
sour
mess
so
i
put
it
away
trying
it
again
i
thought
its
pretty
tasty
and
came
to
a
conclusion
that
this
style
cannot
be
mixed
with
others
or
at
least
drink
this
first
imo
i
appreciate
the
effort
of
hundreds
of
pounds
of
michigan
peaches
added
to
this
but
to
be
fair
i
really
didnt
get
a
lot
of
peach
anyway
tasty
nonetheless
overall
really
awesome
berliner
weisse
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
just
a
little
bit
more
peach
flavor
might
make
it
stand
out
from
other
great
examples
of
the
style
a
light
poppy
ale
that
would
be
very
refreshing
in
warm
weather
pretty
good
although
i
have
had
better
bws
but
its
nice
to
see
more
breweries
experimenting
with
the
style
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
it
at
a
decent
price
yet
another
berliner
that
is
slightly
off
the
authenticity
track
but
tastes
darn
good
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
right
now
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
festina
peche
from
dogfish
than
the
true
berliners
hazy
pale
yellow
color
soda
bubbles
sweet
and
fruity
nose
with
plenty
of
yeast
to
balance
the
sweet
more
funk
than
tart
or
sour
but
a
clean
low
acid
feel
to
it
the
flavor
features
prominent
peach
fresh
and
ripe
a
nice
use
of
the
fruit
wheat
malt
is
in
abundance
and
there
is
a
tartness
but
its
subtle
and
its
after
the
swallow
i
like
the
lightness
and
brightness
of
this
the
feel
really
works
aggressive
carbonation
cuts
the
sweet
of
the
fruit
and
aids
the
funky
finish
but
i
expect
quite
a
bit
more
lactic
tartness
is
my
berliner
weiss
than
this
still
another
fun
and
tasty
brew
from
perennial
who
seems
to
be
really
exploding
into
the
colorado
market
lately
good
for
them
good
for
us
overall
not
bad
but
the
strange
aftertaste
keeps
this
one
from
being
really
good
if
it
were
cheaper
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
but
at
its
price
point
i
would
pass
on
it
in
the
future
overally
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
and
one
that
can
be
used
for
people
who
dont
necessarily
prefer
sours
but
are
interested
in
trying
more
or
learning
to
like
them
in
fact
this
bottle
was
shared
with
several
people
who
would
say
they
werent
fans
of
sour
beer
but
each
one
of
them
liked
this
beer
its
a
crossover
a
mindopener
if
you
will
overall
quite
different
than
most
peach
beers
and
even
berliner
weisses
ive
had
but
theres
not
much
peach
to
this
and
ive
had
better
berliners
perhaps
not
as
tart
as
some
of
the
originals
but
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
with
the
peach
character
i
am
not
reaching
for
some
sort
of
syrup
to
be
able
to
quaff
it
back
very
well
done
o
there
was
a
pleasant
tartness
to
this
beer
but
not
quite
the
light
sourness
that
i
expected
for
the
style
though
that
is
fine
and
i
found
the
addition
of
the
peaches
to
be
a
really
nice
touch
very
easy
ti
drink
enjoyable
and
refreshing
o
this
beer
is
nice
and
peachy
but
is
easy
to
drink
because
it
is
hardly
sour
and
this
masks
ut
any
sweetness
from
the
peaches
7
610
overall
quite
nice
surprised
how
well
the
blend
of
peach
flavors
and
sour
berliner
weiss
flavors
went
together
a
very
nice
beer
but
a
little
lacking
on
the
sour
aroma
the
peach
came
through
very
well
and
the
berliner
weiss
eventually
came
through
on
the
flavor
nicely
o
overall
i
was
floored
by
this
beer
so
peachy
and
berliner
it
is
just
so
balanced
and
tasty
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
overall
wish
it
were
sour
good
peach
aroma
though
peach
berlinerweisse
is
best
served
cold
as
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
i
like
to
drink
it
with
dinner
during
the
ever
more
frequent
heatwaves
in
the
midwest
july
2012
108
degrees
in
stl
this
beer
is
light
and
tasty
very
peachy
lighter
body
decent
carbonation
juicy
and
thin
on
the
tongue
pretty
solid
fruitbased
berliner
but
theres
some
much
better
examples
out
there
right
now
ie
funky
buddha
o
this
was
okay
nothing
offensive
but
it
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
much
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
and
a
huge
letdown
after
how
much
i
loved
perennial
at
fobab
this
tastes
like
a
light
lager
and
ive
never
had
a
berliner
before
that
was
this
bad
not
remotely
tart
just
a
bad
all
around
beer
hopefully
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
andor
perennial
will
start
bottling
their
better
stuff
soon
o
this
is
a
pleasant
and
sufficiently
peachy
berliner
very
nice
the
first
offering
ive
had
from
this
brewery
really
solid
overall
but
the
price
tag
20
is
a
bit
much
for
this
berlinerweisse
itd
be
my
go
to
if
it
was
more
affordable
though
definitely
worth
trying
o
overall
a
pretty
decent
berliner
the
nose
has
some
peach
but
is
pretty
average
isnt
sour
at
all
and
not
much
funk
the
taste
has
more
of
both
though
still
light
and
is
pretty
nice
and
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
a
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
based
on
the
actual
beer
itself
but
would
never
buy
again
for
that
price
hard
to
justify
paying
2021
for
a
bottle
of
a
decent
berliner
when
there
are
better
beers
out
there
for
cheaper
would
pass
at
this
price
but
maybe
try
it
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
for
a
decent
price
o
light
and
easy
drinking
definitely
some
peach
there
but
a
little
light
for
what
i
was
hoping
for
would
have
liked
a
touch
more
tartness
as
well
its
enjoyable
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
paid
20
for
this
bottle
in
nyc
and
am
disappointed
that
it
was
this
much
of
a
let
down
from
the
price
just
like
risgoop
ive
had
this
before
ontap
but
the
experience
was
kinda
iffy
on
my
part
so
im
glad
to
have
a
second
chance
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
wan
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
white
grape
cinnamon
and
light
wheat
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
peach
white
grape
lemon
juice
and
light
wheat
not
really
much
tartness
at
all
which
is
a
decent
disappointment
considering
the
style
in
question
the
body
straddles
the
line
between
discord
and
rhyi
mean
heavy
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
berliner
with
littletono
tartness
and
the
same
amount
of
peach
really
its
not
overly
offensive
necessarily
but
theres
nothing
about
it
that
makes
me
want
to
drink
it
ever
again
o
this
is
a
very
light
but
rather
refreshing
beer
whose
delicate
and
simplistic
flavor
profile
would
probably
be
better
enjoyed
on
a
hot
summer
day
that
said
i
remember
having
this
at
gtmw
and
dont
recall
it
being
an
overly
exciting
beer
on
that
summer
day
either
poured
into
glass
appearance
is
pale
and
bubbly
with
white
head
reminds
me
of
pouring
a
glass
of
champagne
the
nose
is
fruity
with
pithy
peach
lemon
and
dry
notes
of
wheat
bread
the
taste
is
relatively
tart
up
front
with
plenty
of
fruit
in
the
middle
this
is
light
and
refreshing
probably
better
served
on
a
hot
summery
day
outdoors
the
peach
doesnt
make
a
huge
appearance
but
overall
a
solid
version
of
the
style
d
had
this
at
great
taste
and
loved
it
strange
that
the
peach
seemed
stronger
on
draft
without
the
nutmeg
i
am
getting
now
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
light
and
easy
drinking
and
an
overall
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
the
natural
peach
flavoring
here
that
at
times
seemed
to
add
its
own
level
of
tartness
to
the
already
present
lacto
that
was
lemonlike
overall
solid
balance
with
enough
sweet
cereal
grain
inclusion
to
keep
this
one
very
easy
drinking
i
would
partake
in
this
again
its
just
ok
a
bit
underwhelming
for
the
premium
they
are
charging
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
although
it
really
bends
the
definition
of
berliner
weiss
style
this
beer
is
really
really
really
drinkable
very
light
and
smooth
and
at
4
2
you
could
drink
it
for
days
excellent
for
these
last
summer
days
o
umm
very
refreshing
beer
not
very
educated
on
berlinerweisss
but
i
thought
it
would
be
more
sourtart
it
is
still
a
nice
refreshing
light
beer
that
has
some
fruit
and
sour
notes
overall
this
is
a
super
beer
ridiculously
drinkable
due
to
the
low
abv
balanced
fruit
and
sour
flavor
profile
and
just
overall
delicious
flavor
a
great
balance
of
fruit
and
sour
session
ale
pretty
good
offering
by
the
guys
at
perennial
i
like
what
they
are
accomplishing
over
there
crisp
clean
lactic
tartness
in
the
taste
bright
and
quenching
fruity
peach
note
is
tart
with
no
sweetness
sort
of
in
the
background
less
fruity
and
sour
than
festina
peche
very
light
bodied
dry
finish
clean
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
fruit
overall
its
highly
drinkable
and
a
great
beer
to
quench
thirst
in
the
summer
heat
hope
to
see
this
on
draft
around
town
before
summer
is
over
d
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
by
perennial
i
havent
had
one
with
fruit
before
and
really
enjoyed
it
tart
refreshing
flavorful
low
abv
yes
please
super
bready
nose
crisp
tart
clean
tastes
like
summertime
love
this
beer
poured
from
bomber
into
a
snifter
crisp
flavor
with
a
nice
gentle
sour
after
taste
a
near
perfect
example
of
a
berliner
wiess
with
the
added
benefit
of
a
bit
more
abv
22oz
bottle
that
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
about
six
months
hazy
yellow
color
small
head
aroma
was
wheaty
and
hinted
at
tartness
mildly
tart
really
good
flavor
had
this
right
after
a
snarling
badger
and
this
was
mile
ahead
of
that
one
nice
stuff
overall
the
beer
is
dry
crisp
tart
and
refreshing
excellent
summer
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
berliner
weisse
style
it
drinks
like
a
standard
berliner
weiss
despite
the
abv
being
higher
than
true
to
style
no
frills
here
and
i
appreciate
that
verdict
a
very
refreshing
beer
from
three
floyds
and
easily
one
of
the
simplest
beers
theyve
made
fairly
true
to
style
although
much
higher
abv
although
youd
hardly
notice
the
difference
between
this
and
a
23
abv
berliner
perhaps
a
bit
too
acidic
but
thirst
quenching
nonetheless
pours
a
clear
gold

13
inch

decent
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
lemon
pale
malt
hops
slight
sweet
malt
yeast
and
a
hint
of
sourness
fits
the
style
of
a
berliner
weissbier
mouth
feel
is
strong
tartness
crisp
sharp
and
high
carbonation
tastes
of
sweet

pale

overall
weaker

than
the

o
very
good

and

all
around
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
heaviest
berliners
ive
had
extremely
delicious
though
thanks
for
including
this
paul
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
with
malt
grain
fruit
funk
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
grain
fruit
and
acidic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
not
only
one
of
my
favorites
but
also
one
of
the
best
from
3f
crisp
refreshing
flavorfull
just
amazing
should
you
come
across
any
bombers
stock
up
on
as
many
as
you
can
you
will
want
to
savor
deesko
as
frequently
as
possible
an
odd
take
on
the
style
thats
not
without
its
good
and
unique
qualities
as
a
berliner
its
strange
and
abnormally
high
in
abv
as
a
post
run
sour
beer
it
hits
some
positive
notes
overall
not
what
i
expect
from
a
berliner
some
of
these
flavors
dont
belong
the
beer
is
clear
and
light
golden
with
a
small
white
head
scents
include
lemons
ornage
peel
light
funk
lactic
sourness
stone
fruit
nice
flavor
with
everything
coming
together
nicely
puckering
finish
with
lingering
tart
citrus
my
chief
complaint
is
the
abv
which
i
feel
could
be
lower
making
the
beer
more
refreshing
and
quaffable
still
a
solid
offering
from
fff
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
sour
berliner
weissbier
really
with
i
some
raspberry
syrup
to
put
in
this
i
feel
that
would
be
really
good
overall
not
a
fan
since
im
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
its
about
on
par
with
new
glaruss
berliner
weisse
that
ive
tried
looks
like
a
dark
apple
juice
nice
nose
on
this
lots
of
citrus
phenolic
acid
smells
just
like
a
berliner
should
huge
tartness
upfront
and
mellows
out
with
a
wheat
malt
finish
very
nice
carbonation
on
this
quite
refreshing
could
see
myself
drinking
a
ton
of
this
in
the
summer
o
maybe
a
touch
more
grainy
than
i
like
my
berliner
weisse
but
true
to
style
puckeringly
tart
and
very
crushable
a
great
summer
quaff
the
first
sour
ale
that
i
have
ever
tried
the
taste
was
rich
and
full
of
flavor
it
is
quite
sour
but
personally
i
like
that
i
have
had
other
sours
but
deesko
is
still
the
best
one
ive
ever
tried
unfortunately
3
floyds
does
not
brew
this
often
if
youre
looking
to
try
your
first
sour
then
i
recommend
this
beer
strongly
it
will
change
your
life
overall
the
beer
is
the
right
amount
of
tartness
sourness
dry
yet
easydrinking
with
a
clean
aftertaste
a
great
beer
berliner
weisse
review
26
its
lightbodied
but
this
one
might
be
an
example
of
a
beer
that
should
have
a
little
more
body
just
to
carry
thh
big
flavors
through
a
bit
more
wheaty
heft
not
much
it
might
be
a
bit
more
of
a
break
from
tradition
but
it
seems
necessary
just
to
a
small
degree
as
it
is
its
nicely
crisp
bright
and
acidic
but
still
smooth
o
tart
from
begining
to
end
with
hints
of
bread
and
citrus
not
the
mostt
drinkable
beer
but
im
glad
i
was
able
to
snag
a
bottle
at
the
brewery
o
nice
tart
and
refreshing
berliner
it
isnt
too
complex
but
it
gets
the
light
tart
profile
just
right
definitely
a
beer
to
sit
on
the
porch
and
drink
during
the
hotter
months
i
liked
this
more
and
more
everytime
i
tried
it
it
is
not
the
starter
sour
beer
as
some
berliners
have
been
hailed
to
be
but
great
if
you
cant
get
enough
of
the
sour
like
me
wonder
what
the
gobbledygook
is
this
not
normal
berliner
weisse
is
a
tart
and
refreshing
liquid
homage
to
euro
culture
sure
why
not
i
doubt
that
this
is
being
consumed
in
any
desk
or
nazi
tanks
unless
its
euroculture
fashion
to
drink
feline
urinary
sauvignonblancy
vegetal
grassy
wild
and
yeasty
and
everso
crazy
othe
initial
tart
notes
are
great
but
the
bread
finish
throws
off
the
balance
and
ruins
the
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
like
a
straight
shot
of
sour
and
this
provided
doesnt
stay
true
to
the
berliner
style
based
on
the
other
berliners
ive
tried
but
great
otherwise
overall
refreshing
and
a
very
sour
version
of
the
berliner
weiss
style
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
its
too
bad
fff
isnt
selling
more
of
it
right
now
at
the
pub
because
i
would
buy
a
couple
of
these
they
are
like
a
nonfarmhouse
geuze
and
plenty
sour
which
is
what
ive
been
in
the
mood
for
lately
really
loving
the
hell
out
of
this
one
again
fff
nails
yet
another
style
down
to
the
t
a
pleasant
american
wild
alesour
but
this
didnt
really
resemble
a
berliner
much
at
all
quite
tasty
at
colder
temperatures
but
it
began
to
fall
apart
as
it
warmed
a
bit
of
a
whitegreen
grape
character
is
present
along
with
moderate
sourness
throughout
some
vinegar
a
decent
sour
from
three
floyds
but
an
unrepresentative
berliner
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
there
is
a
sticky
was
that
comes
from
the
sour
that
is
not
like
that
of
a
hop
stickiness
at
all
however
light
feel
and
carbonation
keep
it
refreshing
an
excellent
effort
from
the
floyds
this
is
really
hittin
the
spot
yea
im
pretty
sure
my
face
is
going
to
stick
this
way
overall
an
interesting
brew
the
higher
abv
gives
this
brew
some
uniqueness
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
or
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
reviewed
from
notes
pours
a
relatively
clear
gold
with
minimal
head
the
nose
is
a
tad
funky
with
heavy
lemon
character
up
front
followed
by
wheat
bread
and
acidity
the
taste
is
basically
exactly
what
the
o
promises
waves
of
citric
tartness
balanced
by
grainy
wheat
character
the
body
is
super
light
ith
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
well
balanced
and
refreshing
d
i
think
this
is
basically
the
same
as
i
3
deesko
although
the
bottles
seem
to
have
significantly
more
spritz
to
them
than
the
draft
version
i
tried
its
not
subtle
but
its
far
and
away
3
floyds
best
sour
beer
i
think
m
stomach
would
melt
if
i
tried
to
finish
a
22oz
bottle
on
my
own
somehow
im
always
transported
back
to
seventhgrade
german
class
when
i
hear
disco
pronounced
this
way
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
lightly
hazy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
lemon
zest
sour
green
apple
lactic
wheat
and
soft
powdered
sugar
when
all
of
the
sourness
has
passed
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
that
tart
citrus
really
rocking
the
initial
tastes
a
mild
vinegar
character
peeks
in
at
times
as
well
but
never
stays
long
to
chat
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bweiss
one
that
definitely
brings
the
tart
without
overdoing
it
light
hay
colored
with
a
head
that
left
faster
than
a
fart
on
a
windy
day
seems
fitting
adjective
for
funky
beers
yogurt
in
the
aroma
tells
me
itll
be
lactic
so
i
am
excited
tart
and
grassy
and
very
light
and
fleeting
but
manages
to
leave
an
impression
quite
dry
good
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
capped
with
a
one
finger
white
head
fruity
notes
a
bit
of
apple
and
light
citrus
including
lemon
accents
and
some
funk
similar
to
that
found
in
yogurt
or
cheese
on
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
nose
slightly
bitter
apple
light
lemony
citrus
some
grain
accents
and
mild
tart
funkiness
light
bodied
with
light
bubbly
carbonation
the
depth
of
flavor
in
this
brew
doesnt
match
some
others
in
the
style
however
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
an
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
that
keeps
this
light
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
overall
it
fits
the
bill
for
the
style
but
it
falls
slightly
in
the
middle
when
compared
to
other
takes
on
the
style
there
are
some
kinks
that
could
be
worked
out
to
make
it
overall
more
enjoyable
but
asis
it
isnt
bad
by
any
stretch
ok
and
perfectly
drinkable
but
falls
well
short
of
what
i
prefer
out
of
a
berliner
o
i
wasnt
wowed
but
it
was
interesting
to
try
i
liked
bear
republics
tartare
much
better
im
considering
tossing
in
some
flavoring
syrup
for
the
hell
of
it
not
sure
if
the
ontap
syrup
option
is
throwing
this
beer
off
cause
i
have
not
tried
that
but
on
its
own
i
think
its
great
nice
refreshing
light
bodied
beer
with
good
tartness
a
little
sip
went
a
long
way
for
me
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
could
put
them
down
fast
without
a
little
self
restraint
o
light
tart
citrus
wheat
and
corn
sweetness
keep
up
smell
and
taste
have
champagnelike
characteristics
sharp
on
the
nose
and
a
quick
bite
on
the
tongue
before
the
flavor
eases
into
a
tingle
despite
the
bite
overal
flavor
is
mild
to
weak
had
a
pint
of
this
up
north
good
tart
and
refreshing
brew
that
im
sad
is
no
more
one
finger
head
that
sticks
around
pretty
good
then
dwindles
down
to
nothing
lemon
grass
tartness
that
ends
kind
of
dry
good
stuff
im
proud
of
these
hoosiers
d
this
beer
has
no
characteristics
of
a
berliner
weiss
but
had
a
good
head
and
light
mouthfeel
where
are
the
wild
sour
notes
im
glad
i
didnt
get
any
syrup
added
and
why
do
you
served
a
3
abv
beer
in
a
chalice
this
is
certainly
an
easy
drinking
beer
light
carbonation
light
sweet
flavor
and
a
firm
body
if
youre
bringing
your
mom
or
someone
else
to
3f
and
want
them
to
try
something
aside
from
pbr
have
them
give
this
a
go
a
great
crossover
beer
mouthfeel
was
commendable
3
fs
manged
to
make
a
farely
light
beer
have
some
decent
body
and
drinkability
added
a
touch
of
lime
flavoring
and
really
accentuated
the
tartness
a
bit
nice
to
see
a
diverse
style
i
want
to
try
this
one
with
no
syrup
what
a
berliner
weisse
from
an
american
brewpub
thats
kickass
amber
copper
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
carbonation
atop
which
maintains
itself
a
bit
of
a
wheat
aroma
with
some
lime
citric
notes
and
some
rustic
yeastyness
to
it
flavor
is
tart
but
not
real
tart
so
i
stayed
sans
syrup
as
i
think
the
syrup
would
ruin
this
delicate
beer
more
of
a
lemony
citric
tartness
a
slight
grain
coats
the
tartness
and
the
yeast
comes
in
towards
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
spice
maybe
cloves
finish
is
drying
and
a
bit
acidic
quite
refreshing
i
didnt
know
this
was
3
but
that
is
what
one
would
expect
from
a
berliner
weisse
easy
drinking
refrshing
palate
cleansing
if
not
the
most
daring
of
offerings
nice
changeup
mouthfeel
pretyy
sharp
acidity
with
some
syrupy
sweetness
to
balance
everything
out
i
thought
i
would
appreciate
this
style
more
now
that
i
like
sours
but
its
still
not
my
thing
still
brewing
a
berliner
weiss
takes
a
few
special
steps
which
require
skilled
hands
obviously
jacks
abby
is
more
than
adept
for
reasons
entirely
unclear
to
me
the
style
has
yet
to
catch
on
and
sightings
can
be
few
and
far
between
as
result
its
become
a
sort
of
sacred
treat
i
reserve
for
those
days
so
sunny
youre
happy
just
to
be
alive
and
indeed
this
one
fit
the
bill
i
bought
this
last
summer
and
forgot
about
it
in
my
closet
but
i
do
not
think
the
passage
of
time
would
make
this
any
less
tart
funky
or
complex
its
very
good
for
what
it
is
but
its
very
basic
i
mean
that
quite
literally
as
i
could
see
this
acting
as
a
base
for
other
funky
offerings
every
time
i
have
a
beer
from
these
guys
it
forces
me
to
think
about
what
styles
really
mean
their
ability
to
lager
everything
and
add
that
new
element
to
beers
we
thought
we
knew
everything
about
is
special
and
almost
always
successful
i
love
these
guys
i
seek
their
beer
out
and
i
learn
something
every
time
i
have
one
the
berliner
braun
blew
my
mind
and
this
is
close
to
that
always
though
the
ale
yeast
was
part
of
its
very
complexion
but
this
shows
that
the
souring
can
benefit
from
a
slow
cold
fermentation
without
declining
in
intensity
its
like
a
normal
berliner
in
many
ways
but
less
juvenile
more
refined
and
about
average
in
the
pucker
department
hazy
very
pale
straw
colored
brew
with
a
dainty
white
head
nose
and
taste
of
tart
green
apple
and
white
wheat
light
lemon
pucker
in
the
finish
but
it
isnt
sour
not
sure
i
could
definitely
pick
this
out
as
a
lager
not
knowing
the
sour
overpowers
the
lager
yeast
flavor
and
because
of
that
the
finish
isnt
all
that
quick
still
knowing
what
it
is
allows
me
to
look
for
and
then
find
its
differences
and
appreciate
them
more
power
to
these
guys
redefining
the
lager
game
yet
again
i
love
it
one
of
the
better
sours
ive
had
from
ja
but
thats
not
saying
much
drinkable
but
definitely
has
a
bit
of
that
lactobile
thing
going
on
might
be
a
good
candidate
for
the
traditional
syrup
treatment
good
not
great
bottle
poured
a
lightly
hazy
blonde
color
berliner
weisse
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
tart
notes
is
a
bit
onedimensional
taste
is
also
dominated
by
simple
tart
notes
with
light
wheat
malt
also
noticeable
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
berliner
with
limited
amount
of
complexity
overall
i
found
this
one
tasty
it
does
not
have
any
funk
and
almost
no
tartness
but
it
is
a
refreshing
and
tasty
lighter
beer
worth
checking
out
but
dont
expect
it
to
be
too
tart
or
funky
thin
and
light
with
a
slightly
skunky
overtone
and
wonderfully
sour
o
interesting
berliner
hard
to
place
it
it
doesnt
taste
like
your
typical
berliner
at
all
but
its
very
crisp
clean
and
drinkable
at
the
same
time
simple
and
light
of
course
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
nice
balancy
of
sweet
grains
and
light
tartness
indeed
very
sour
i
dont
much
care
for
these
slight
green
tint
i
havent
had
many
berliner
weissbiers
but
i
dig
this
sour
beers
are
trendy
right
now
and
so
much
focus
and
some
pretension
is
being
given
to
belgian
examples
that
its
a
really
nice
change
of
pace
to
embrace
germanys
sour
styles
not
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
but
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
grab
when
available
overall
pretty
nice
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
still
refreshing
and
enjoyable
for
a
nice
summer
beer
a
miss
from
jacks
abby
unfortunately
pours
the
color
of
pale
straw
and
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
one
finger
head
of
fizzy
white
foam
that
falls
off
fast
the
nose
is
tart
with
a
bit
of
lactic
sour
perhaps
a
hint
of
something
lemony
a
bit
of
hop
floral
and
a
hint
of
malt
the
wheat
scent
is
hard
to
miss
and
i
personally
love
it
in
a
beer
smells
like
the
color
of
sunshine
golden
the
taste
is
perfect
a
slightly
sharp
bite
of
acidity
greets
the
palate
with
all
the
tartness
of
a
lemon
that
has
been
slightly
sweetened
by
the
wheat
malt
presence
the
malt
in
this
one
is
a
gentlemanly
compliment
like
in
a
ballet
where
the
man
stands
tall
yet
firm
while
the
girl
dances
beautifully
around
him
sour
tart
and
a
bit
of
pucker
no
hop
bitterness
light
body
clean
dry
finish
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
day
on
tap
at
new
york
pizza
pours
a
cloudy
light
straw
color
with
very
little
head
zero
lacing
very
tart
aroma
of
lemon
wheat
and
lime
the
taste
is
sour
lemon
wheat
funk
and
maybe
a
hint
of
pepper
finishes
with
a
nice
tartness
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
thanks
in
part
to
the
low
abv
obviously
very
interesting
twist
on
an
existing
style
but
that
is
what
jacks
abby
does
well
so
it
is
not
surprising
overall
good
summer
brew
ill
look
for
again
oi
love
jacks
abby
and
this
was
further
proof
that
they
are
likely
to
stand
out
in
any
crowd
of
beers
more
sour
on
the
tongue
very
very
spritzy
but
the
body
is
decent
the
aftertaste
is
tart
but
not
overly
so
a
light
tart
and
a
slightly
salty
sour
wet
sock
finish
but
in
a
good
way
as
to
not
overpower
could
drink
this
all
day
love
this
beer
my
official
brew
of
summer
light
and
refreshing
with
just
the
right
amount
of
pucker
for
a
sour
sad
it
wont
be
back
this
year
but
hoping
the
new
sour
is
even
better
golden
straw
with
a
pinkish
hue
to
it
tons
of
active
carbonation
thin
light
pink
head
fades
fast
and
leaves
no
lacing
tart
in
the
nose
lemon
sour
apple
berry
and
a
little
funk
tart
on
the
taste
lemon
sour
apple
and
a
hint
of
mulberry
in
the
finish
straight
forward
but
great
sharp
carbonation
carries
that
tart
flavor
and
gives
a
highly
carbonated
feel
all
the
way
through
the
finish
and
some
dryness
at
the
end
great
beer
for
the
style
with
a
nice
twist
with
the
mulberry
decent
didnt
do
it
for
me
but
i
do
like
the
effort
to
get
different
styles
out
to
the
people
liked
it
up
front
but
the
finish
lingered
a
bit
too
long
o
a
nice
light
berliner
weisse
serving
type
can
can
shared
at
the
swamp
head
batch

release
pours
a
purplish
pink
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
on
top
aroma
of
mulberries
sour
vinegar
wheaty
malts
and
berliner
like
yeastiness
flavor
follows
with
big
notes
of
mulberrieswow
they
go
really
well
in
this
stylewheat
malts
yeasty
tart
berliner
notes
some
lemon
peel
and
some
floral
notes
really
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
while
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
generally
this
was
very
nice
i
would
have
it
again
for
sure
overall
a
versatile
and
complex
sour
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
mulberries
play
well
and
plenty
of
other
fruit
and
sweet
malts
throughout
create
an
exciting
experience
for
the
drinker
i
think
this
brew
would
play
well
with
a
newbie
to
sours
or
a
hardened
fan
of
the
tart
well
done
o
i
havent
had
too
many
carton
beers
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
if
not
the
best
boat
is
awesome
as
well
would
definitely
recommend
this
batch
perfect
for
a
nice
summer
day
pourded
into
a
wine
glass
pinkish
hued
in
color
with
a
half
of
finger
of
large
white
bubbled
head
smells
of
wheat
and
not
much
else
easy
drinking
thats
for
sure
a
slight
sour
crispness
to
it
super
duper
crushable
dont
know
what
a
mulberry
taste
like
but
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
berry
taste
to
it
this
was
really
nice
summer
beer
not
super
tart
but
definitely
an
above
par
berliner
bottom
line
enjoyable
beer
o
was
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
but
i
would
say
it
wasnt
terrible
i
guess
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
not
to
hard
to
drink
but
just
something
i
didnt
enjoy
first
beer
ive
ever
had
with
mulberry
and
its
a
low
alcohol
summer
berliner
how
perfect
cleverly
thought
out
and
well
executed
this
pinkish
purple
pale
blonde
white
beer
smells
like
tart
fruit
juice
and
a
heavy
sour
lacto
mash
its
white
wheat
low
body
high
refreshment
maximum
drinkability
this
is
a
perfect
summer
drink
tart
enough
to
be
refreshing
without
being
sour
enough
to
sit
weird
in
the
belly
or
be
caustic
when
it
warms
up
a
little
the
low
abv
makes
it
an
all
day
beer
and
i
think
the
pint
can
is
a
nice
format
for
it
a
touch
of
white
white
acidity
in
the
finish
along
with
the
fruit
which
i
wouldnt
immediately
identify
as
mulberry
but
it
is
a
little
different
from
other
fruits
really
juicy
and
tart
carbonation
is
medium
but
its
enough
with
how
light
the
body
is
overall
a
really
fun
beer
and
a
little
something
different
a
great
first
impression
from
these
guys
as
well
worth
seeking
out
o
it
was
a
threehour
oneway
drive
from
my
house
to
the
brewery
to
try
this
as
well
as
the
other
brews
ontap
i
also
worked
in
a
hike
at
the
beach
at
nearby
sandy
hook
and
then
drove
back
home
i
brought
back
this
brew
boat
and
077xx
all
are
very
good
but
from
a
uniqueness
standpoint
this
stands
above
the
others
i
think
my
wife
is
really
going
to
like
this
one
when
she
tries
it
i
certainly
do
overall
tasty
refreshing
and
crushable
sightly
weird
aftertaste
kept
it
from
scoring
higher
but
this
is
still
a
great
summer
beer
the
beer
is
a
bit
light
on
flavor
has
a
tartness
of
apple
cider
but
also
some
funk
and
wheat
of
a
berliner
weiss
had
a
glass
at
good
beer
in
the
east
village
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
havent
tried
many
good
americanmade
berliners
usually
theyre
all
bite
without
much
flavor
this
beer
however
had
a
light
creamy
malt
character
with
touches
of
fruit
in
addition
to
the
wellbalanced
tart
bike
very
cool
beer
i
hope
to
find
more
of
this
in
the
summer
o
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
afternoonevening
i
really
enjoy
this
one
and
could
really
see
myself
enjoying
quite
a
few
of
these
definitely
sessionable
excellent
interesting
tasty
berliner
would
happily
drink
again

very
well
together
decent
berliner
weisse
very
much
in
the
organic
school
of
beers
cheers
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
but
very
well
carbonated
highly
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
as
i
drink
it
i
think
it
would
also
act
as
an
excellent
base
for
some
summer
punch
o
this
is
an
excellent
berliner
im
not
overly
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
one
impresses
its
a
great
balance
between
tartness
funk
wheat
sweet
its
low
abv
and
crispness
make
this
an
excellent
summer
beer
strong
offering
here
from
carton
and
im
happy
to
have
found
this
on
tap
at
a
local
store
o
really
enjoyed
this
8oz
pour
drank
it
in
near
record
time
on
this
hot
nyc
night
medium
bodid
with
some
tart
puckering
acidity
up
front
thats
countered
by
citrus
fruit
and
sourdough
bread
notes
flavors
fall
off
midpalate
and
there
is
an
odd
metallic
adjunct
flavor
that
overpowers
doesnt
have
traditional
characteristics
associated
with
the
style
lacking
in
bready
yeast
fullness
in
body
lactic
funk
and
wheat
beer
notes
kind
of
bland
really
with
some
lactic
funk
and
sour
lemon
acidity
up
front
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
this
beer
goes
down
easily
and
is
very
sessionable
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
after
the
fact
edit
freaking
mulberries
never
would
have
guessed
that
based
on
how
it
didnt
impart
any
discoloration
in
the
brew
o
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
an
easy
to
drink
berliner
that
was
very
reasonbably
prices
not
overly
sour
or
funky
but
could
definitely
have
a
few
glasses
of
it
and
would
like
to
again
pours
straw
gold
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
tart
peaches
and
apples
with
a
slight
barnyard
ish
funk
taste
is
slightly
tart
green
apples
up
front
that
mellows
out
to
a
very
nice
funky
wheat
base
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
very
on
point
for
the
style
overall
probably
the
most
refershing
thing
i
could
have
ordered
on
this
94
degree
nyc
day
and
at
3
9abv
i
think
i
can
drink
it
all
day
carton

chased
the

a
slightly
hazy
goldenrod
with
a
wispy
bit
of
white
foam
lingering
for
a
minute
before
dissipating
the

has
plenty
of
lactic
tartness
along
with
a
light

aroma
the
flavor
profile
opens
with
a
touch
of
wheaty
grainy
sweetness
a
big
lactic
sour
and
funk
note
comes
in
next
and
fills
in
the
majority
of
the
beer
the
finish
where
most
berliner
weissbiers
lose
me
is
saved
by
a
subtle
fresh
berry
note
that
works
very
nicely
with
all
that
came
before
it
the
body
is
appropriately
light
and
the
carbonation
which
doesnt
leap
out
of
the
glass
has
a
certain
pep
to
it
monkey
chased
the
weasel
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
berliner
weissbiers
ive
had
the
addition
of
mulberries
really
helps
it
shine
over
more
traditional
offerings
o
overall
a
fantastic
berliner
weiss
crisp
flavorful
drinkable
and
refreshing
its
so
nice
to
see
a
local
brewery
doing
a
berliner
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
this
is
a
very
nice
understated
sour
not
terribly
complex
but
a
great
beginner
sour
beer
insanely
drinkable
lighter
medium
body
crisp
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
highly
refreshing
i
was
waiting
since
march
to
try
this
and
im
definitely
excited
about
this
one
nice
balance
between
low
alcohol
tartness
and
fruit
i
want
another
growler
overall
this
is
a
super
flavorful
beer
for
being
so
light
in
abv
i
normally
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
at
all
but
the
addition
of
mulberries
has
added
a
freshing
dynamic
that
elevates
this
beer
to
a
new
level
so
impressed
by
carton
and
superpsyched
to
see
more
great
local
beer
from
nj
never
drank
a
beer
that
i
had
to
pour
out
after
3
sips
this
smells
awful
o
flavor
is
pretty
good
but
the
look
is
off
overall
a
great
berliner
weisse
the
aroma
is
so
unique
but
a
great
quality
that
allows
you
to
understand
this
beers
progression
from
fermentation
pours
a
finger
of
furiously
fizzy
head
with
a
very
pale
straw
color
almost
diluted
lemonaide
like
nose
is
off
some
lactic
acidity
and
tart
lemons
with
a
super
funky
and
ripe
brett
makes
ne
think
of
vitamins
and
dog
food
tastes
better
than
the
nose
lots
of
tart
lemons
and
lactic
acid
with
that
odd
funk
in
the
background
prickly
carbonation
with
a
little
bit
of
lip
smacking
easy
drinking
aside
from
that
odd
funk
overall
its
a
decent
take
on
the
style
not
sure
whats
up
with
that
nasty
funk
overall
big
and
lemony
tart
and
sour
a
very
interesting
brew
which
even
while
puckering
is
still
somewhat
refreshing
a
very
interesting
try
will
review
again
when
i
have
the
beer
on
its
own
overall
decent
beer
but
not
great
worth
a
try
but
no
need
to
seek
out
o
overall
there
is
a
good
level
of
tart
and
spicy
flavor
here
packagaed
in
a
4
0
abv
that
many
can
not
claim
that
just
may
surprise
you
quickly
dissipating
head
pale
straw
color
sour
fruitiness
tart
and
spicy
flavor
all
within
the
general
guidelines
of
style
making
for
a
good
berliner
not
many
american
breweries
attempt
to
brew
such
a
style
o
very
different
brew
maybe
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
exact
style
but
i
like
its
uniqueness
and
especially
good
on
hot
summer
evening
this
is
very
german
in
style
almost
soda
like
i
have
to
say
sourness
is
definitely
there
grabs
at
the
mouth
and
pulls
very
onpoint
it
could
be
rounded
out
a
bit
puns
but
for
what
it
is
i
like
it
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
stop
by
and
try
this
one
this
poured
out
as
a
milky
looking
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
definitely
tart
lots
of
citric
acid
aromas
dominate
this
brew
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
in
fact
a
lot
like
a
fresh
lemonade
makes
the
taste
buds
tingle
and
almost
makes
the
lips
pucker
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
carbonated
with
a
very
light
body
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
liked
it
better
once
the
raspberry
syrup
was
added
but
thats
because
i
am
not
a
big
sour
beer
fan
still
worth
a
try
o
super
solid
offering
from
a
new
local
brewery
that
alone
makes
this
beer
a
winner
for
me
will
also
note
that
my
bottle
says
4
abv
yet
both
this
site
and
their
site
lists
it
as
3
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
tart
slightly
puckering
sourness
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
into
a
dry
finish
strog
lactic
funk
woth
again
a
strong
cheesymilky
flavor
theres
also
some
musty
bret
thats
countered
by
sweet
citric
acid
and
a
sourdough
bred
flavor
lots
of
lemon
peelcitrus
flavor
but
the
cheesy
funk
is
a
bit
overpowering
light
body
solid
carbonation
goes
down
super
easy
totally
sessionable
tarter
and
funkier
than
most
american
berliners
ive
tried
recommended
but
only
to
those
who
dont
mind
a
little
funky
foot
cheese
wafting
all
up
in
their
grills
pretty
mild
on
the
tartness
and
slightly
acidic
on
the
back
of
the
tounge
the
taste
seems
to
fade
out
towards
the
end
light
bodied
and
boldly
carbed
up
the
low
abv
makes
it
easy
for
a
few
i
hope
to
find
some
six
packs
some
day
a
nice
incredibly
drinkable
berliner

style
i
enjoy
this
is
a
must

its

54this
was
highly
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
wanting
to
try
a
sour
for
the
first
time
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
this
newer
brewery
xhopeaterxmay
01
and
whenever
a
brewer
decides
to
make
one
not
frequently
enough
it
seems
looked
and
smelled
great
then
downhill
path
as
once
i
began
to
drink
it
i
got
a
very
thin
watery
mouth
feel
having
tried
other
sara
beers
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
bottom
beers
they
have
to
offer
nice
lemon
zest
flavor
and
crisp
but
just
not
enough
mouth
feel
or
other
flavors
come
through
750
ml
bottle
part
of
fall
2014
batch
my
bottle
was
quite
sour
strong
on
lemon
and
wheat
with
surprisingly
low
carbonation
almost
flat
not
the
most
complex
sour
beer
youll
ever
have
but
fresh
characterful
and
highly
drinkable
light
lemon
tart
and
sour
taste
the
most
recent
batch
is
4
abv
pour
is
a
transparent
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
immediately
and
then
sits
still
nose
is
a
bit
sharp
loads
of
dustiness
moderate
lacto
and
a
fair
bit
of
lemon
taste
is
a
bit
more
lemony
lacto
mid
palate
but
gentle
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
still
fairly
dusty
up
front
with
notes
of
grains
lighter
body
a
bit
slick
mid
palate
strong
carb
o
very
refreshing
berliner
not
the
most
complex
or
interesting
i
have
to
imagine
that
adding
fruit
to
this
would
get
this
up
to
the
next
level
though
o
nice
but
not
great
honestly
this
is
on
the
lower
end
of
the
sara
brews
ive
tried
in
terms
of
my
enjoyment
its
clean
light
drying
and
very
drinkable
so
its
a
fine
example
of
its
style
that
said
new
glarus
just
does
it
better
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
they
do
it
for
14
the
price
and
in
a
much
more
accessible
way
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
bottles
unless
they
were
for
someone
else
pours
a

is
much
the

flavors
on
the

there
is

mild

this
beer
has
a

with
a

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
o
tart
and
acidic
take
on
a
german
low
abv
very
drinkable
and
nice
overall
pretty

contributing
just
enough
fruit
and
acidity
without
taking
over
o
i
think
i
like
this
better
than
their
blueberry
berliner
the
fruit
is
a
bit
better
integrated
and
a
more
balanced
yet
refreshing
profile
overall
my
only
complaint
is
it
borderlines
as
a
fruit
lambic
versus
a
purer
berliner
weiss
crushable
o
i
actually
like
blue
lady
a
bit
better
than
this
but
this
is
still
tasty
and
worth
picking
up
when
you
can
find
it
m
light
leading
to
medium
due
to
malts
sweetness
pretty
good
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
four
berliners
but
as
already
mentioned
im
slightly
biased
towards
raspberries
nice
fruity
flavor
nice
upfront
tartness
and
very
easy
to
throw
back
refreshing
crispy
tasty
very
clear
vibrant
pink
with
a
big
lightly
pinkish
head
lots
of
raspberry
aroma
and
taste
with
light
dry
earthy
brett
notes
tart
but
not
excessively
despite
the
amount
of
raspberry
flavor
moderate
carbonation
light
and
crisp
easy
to
drink
a
favorite
of
the
day
bright
pink
with
a
pinkish
white

moderate
retention
and
decent
lacing
nose
has
bright
fresh
raspberry
notes
yogurt
and
lactic
character
sharp
wheat
as
well
taste
has
sharp
tartness
off
the
bat
and
tart
raspberrycranberry
juice
sharp
wheat
character
comes
through
mid
palate
with
gentle
fruit
character
and
mild
tartness
well
into
the
finish
medium
light
palate
high
carbonation
a
very
nice
fruited
berliner
and
having
this
in
the
dead
of
winter
probably
doesnt
do
this
justice
overall
this
beer
really
surprised
me
and
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
the
focus
is
definately
on
the
raspberries
i
would
seriously
consider
this
beer
as
an
alternative
to
a
table
beer
that
would
normally
hold
up
to
alot
of
different
and
deverse
food
pairings
from
appetizers
cheese
salads
light
pasta
dishes
sushiseafood
and
even
some
desserts
i
dont
know
alot
about
a
berliner
wiess
style
beer
but
this
beer
has
captured
my
interest
pipeworks
did
a
good
job
with
this
beer
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
beer
its
a
creative
concept
that
pipeworks
had
here
to
just
brew
the
berliner
wiess
with
raspberries
instead
of
serving
it
with
the
traditional
raspberry
syrup
199th
o
this
was
a
bit
of
an
odd
beer
i
descibed
it
as
a
good
palate
cleanser
to
the
tasting
group
overall
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
bws
by
pipeworks
everything
is
in
line
with
a
solid
bw
the
smell
makes
me
think
of
frankenberry
or
a
box
of
special
k
red
berries
cereal
pours
a
murky
light
red
with
a
foamy
reddishwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
raspberries
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
vomit
or
bile
note
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
flavor
on
the
finish
throws
me
off
a
bit
will
definitely
buy
this
again
next
summer
o
this
is
a
nice
crisp
fruity
beer
with
hints
of
berliner
weisse
funk
very
drinkable
o
well
done
berliner
wish
more
of
the
awesome
raspberry
aroma
was
also
found
in
the
taste
but
this
is
very
good
o
a
well
balanced
berliner
with
just
the
right
amount
of
fruit
the
raspberries
were
not
overpowering
but
definitely
at
the
front
there
was
also
a
slight
wheat
component
that
really
helped
balance
this
beer
nicely
it
has
a
perfect
clean
crisp
tartness
that
youd
want
in
a
bw
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
610
sourness
very
nice
beer
more
tart
than
i
expected
and
enjoyed
with
some
raspberry
notes
to
balance
the
sour
mash
o
greatly
refreshing
with
the
right
amount
of
raspberry
sweetness
and
tartness
the
wheat
played
a
nice
role
in
balancing
out
the
fruit
as
well
d
i
easily
drank
a
750ml
bottle
on
my
own
its
a
solidly
executed
berliner
that
could
use
a
bit
more
ripe
raspberry
flavor
for
my
tastes
thankfully
it
didnt
suffer
from
the
cheese
aroma
that
blue
lady
did
so
im
confident
the
pipeworks
guys
have
figured
out
their
problems
o
recommended
especially
if
you
are
a
raspberry
fan
you
wont
be
disappointed
the
final
beer
of
the
day
from
clybourn
to
mundelein
damn
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
magenta
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
pinkwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
raspberry
must
and
a
touch
of
what
seems
like
vague
wheat
way
the
hell
in
the
background
make
no
mistake
the
raspberries
are
the
stars
here
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
tartness
overshoots
the
berryness
creating
a
feeling
of
just
straight
and
general
tartness
i
was
looking
forward
to
some
actual
raspberry
flavor
but
was
stymied
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
berliner
but
the
raspberries
despite
being
in
control
dont
exert
their
berryforward
selves
throughout
still
enjoyable
though
o
overall
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
and
while
its
not
the
best
berliner
ive
had
its
certainly
not
the
worst
ample
tartness
seedy
raspberry
tannin
dry
finish
middle
is
wheaty
and
clean
but
the
feel
is
a
little
watery
could
be
more
crisp
its
a
little
thin
bodied
at
first
but
not
out
of
place
for
the
style
tart
raspberry
through
and
through
fruity
and
drinkable
some
light
minerals
and
sourdough
from
the
yeast
a
berliner
with
the
classic
himbeere
flavor
built
right
in
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
slightly
fizzy
15
then
becoming
somewhat
foamy
15
and
otherwise
smooth
35
generally
fairly
crisp
and
dry
closes
dry
with
light
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
oa
pretty
nice
bw
good
flavor
the
sediment
was
excessive
and
really
needed
decanting
unfortunately
i
was
very
turned
off
by
the
appearance
i
think
something
went
wrong
with
this
bottle
because
i
am
not
seeing
any
other
complaints
i
drank
it
but
i
was
so
caught
up
with
the
sediment
that
i
wouldnt
let
myself
enjoy
it
to
its
fullest
extent
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
but
it
was
just
a
miss
for
me
if
i
could
drink
it
down
without
being
preoccupied
it
would
be
a
very
refreshing
beer
on
a
warm
day
batch
99
bottle
picked
up
about
a
week
ago
in
a
chicago
trip
enjoyed
from
a
pipeworks
berliner
weiss
glass
beer
poured
such
a
pale
yellow
that
it
looked
almost
white
it
had
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
fizzed
away
quick
smell
is
super
tart
and
super
tangy
lemon
rind
and
some
sour
egg
fairly
cheesy
which
is
a
bit
off
putting
thankfully
the
cheese
is
gone
in
flavor
taste
is
relatively
nice
lemon
sourness
some
egg
but
all
in
all
a
very
nicr
berliner
perfect
for
a
summer
afternoon
nice
fizziness
and
crisp
body
o
my
first
berliner
so
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
his
is
one
beer
that
i
would
not
buy
again
to
be
honest
its
simply
too
bland
definitely
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
style
but
i
have
a
strong
inclination
that
this
is
weak
for
its
style
o
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
nice
sour
notes
good
lemongrass
and
wheat
backbone
taste
just
a
really
well
done
berlinerweisse
so
glad
to
see
more
us
breweries
venturing
into
this
style
and
pipeworks
have
been
pumping
out
some
good
ones
i
suggest
picking
this
up
as
an
intro
into
sours
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
grain
and
slight
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
better
taste
over
smell
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
to
lower
level
of
carbonation
than
what
is
expected
in
the
style
overall
it
is
not
bad
it
is
not
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
nor
even
close
to
the
worst
nicely
done
i
look
forward
to
trying
pipeworks
other
berliner
iterations
but
seriously
what
the
hell
is
going
on
in
the
bottom
of
that
bottle
o
this
is
a
nice
tart
beer
but
is
much
softer
than
its
cousins
from
berlinne
it
has
some
nice
flavor
but
im
not
sure
a
3
4
abv
bomber
is
worth
10
00
it
was
also
frustrating
that
i
couldnt
even
drink
the
second
glass
something
different
fof
pipeworks
americos
bottle
great
hoppy
aroma
a
creamy
head
on
dark
brown
some
chocolate
roasty
taste
with
citrus
in
the
finish
was
expecting
more
significant
sourness
in
the
style
i
can
only
speculate
that
they
purposely
concentrated
on
these
other
elements
o
its
ok
the
fruited
one
is
better
overall
this
is
another
great
berlinner
weissbier
by
pipeworks
i
like
it
more
than
blue
lady
but
its
just
not
near
as
good
as
well
red
temptress
great
to
see
a
brewery
in
illinois
brewing
this
beer
style
and
trying
different
spins
on
a
berlinner
especially
since
you
just
dont
see
that
many
berlinners
on
the
shelfs
in
craft
beer
stores
this
beer
is
very
interesting
as
basically
a
naked
berliner
the
tartness
attacks
your
tongue
then
some
sweetness
and
bright
flavors
surround
its
very
light
and
appealing
for
warm
weather
if
this
is
your
style
then
it
should
satisfy
if
this
isnt
then
this
would
be
a
solid
version
to
try
and
see
if
you
can
develop
a
taste
for
it
overall
so
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
the
sourness
is
very
balanced
does
not
overpower
this
brew
like
other
sours
another
very
unique
style
that
pipeworks
knocks
out
of
the
park
hazy
strawyellow
color
with
a
healthy
fluffy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
crisp
wheat
notes
in
the
nose
lemongrass
mineral
similar
taste
lightly
toasted
wheat
and
crackery
pale
malts
lemon
zest
with
a
touch
of
tartness
grassy
a
little
mineral
in
the
taste
as
well
light
body
thin
but
appropriate
for
a
3
5
beer
champagnelike
carbonation
crisp
and
clean
refreshing
easily
drinkable
d
a
nice
session
option
i
was
able
to
finish
the
bomber
with
minimal
effort
nice
berliner
and
you
get
50
more
for
the
same
price
as
the
german
ones
available
here
would
love
to
see
this
ontap
in
the
summer
as
i
can
imagine
putting
back
a
few
glasses
such
an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beer
yet
packed
pretty
well
with
aroma
and
flavor
given
its
low
alcoholic
content
i
could
put
down
a
bunch
of
these
and
still
be
feeling
fine
keep
them
coming
o
the
acidity
level
here
is
at
just
the
right
amount
and
the
mouthfeel
is
on
point
as
well
i
really
hope
the
pipeworks
guys
make
this
often
as
this
is
one
of
the
better
berliners
ive
had
in
a
while
o
i
quite
like
this
one
particularly
when
its
hard
to
find
a
good
example
of
this
style
in
the
states
truer
to
the
style
than
their
blueberry
variant
which
to
me
felt
more
like
an
american
wild
ale
than
berliner
at
only
3
5
abv
sign
me
up
for
many
more
once
the
weather
starts
to
warm
up
and
i
was
happy
with
the
9
99
price
tag
per
bottle
drink
i
thought
it
was
good
above
average
but
needed
a
bit
more
i
dont
know
if
i
like
the
naked
version
of
the
other
berliner
weisses
i
will
keep
drinking
and
see
how
it
goes
if
they
werent
already
doing
a
good
enough
job
of
it
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
write
copy
for
pipeworks
labels
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
pale
grapefruit
juice
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
a
simple
blast
of
tart
and
juicy
lemon
zest
things
go
from
straight
withintherind
fruit
to
lightlysweetened
lemonade
the
taste
is
more
singleminded
keeping
to
the
tart
and
sour
track
with
a
hunkahunka
burnin
vengeance
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
and
refreshing
little
berliner
good
times
nuff
said
get
some
a
great
americanbrewed
berliner
o
a
nice
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
o
an
enjoyable
berliner
i
must
say
that
i
enjoy
the
fruited
berliners
from
pw
more
but
this
was
a
great
take
on
the
style
and
very
true
extremely
easy
drinking
and
id
love
for
a
rebrew
in
the
summer
months
to
enjoy
on
a
90
degree
chicago
day
o
wasnt
sure
at
first
how
this
was
going
to
be
at
first
glance
and
sniff
but
another
tasty
berliner
from
pw
still
enjoy
their
fruit
berliners
more
but
still
solid
o
this
is
awesome
it
hits
the
style
perfectly
and
imo
is
way
better
without
any
fruit
added
to
it
this
is
a
really
refreshing
and
delicious
beer
glad
i
picked
up
two
of
these
and
will
try
to
grab
a
couple
more
for
when
spring
finally
rolls
around
i
get
whats
trying
to
be
done
its
just
over
done
on
the
lemongrass
not
much
ginger
present
not
my
thing
couldnt
palette
this
beer
extreme
medicinal
taste
first
sour
beer
i
ever
had
took
me
a
while
to
get
use
to
it
but
now
i
love
it
tasted
in
4
ounce
size
at
night
shift
taproom
taste
was
reminiscent
of
lysol
could
not
drink
more
than
a
few
sips
omg
that
is
delicious
thick
straw
yellow
opaque
sour
as
hell
great
ginger
root
and
lemon
grass
lemonade
a
little
salty
phenomenal
love
this
beer
very
tart
very
refreshing
another
excellent
example
of
why
night
shift
is
known
for
its
sours
lemon
grass
and
other
citrus
flavors
and
aroma
are
striking
over
a
biting
slightly
astringent
sourness
barnyard
aromas
are
detectable
under
the
heavy
citrus
aroma
suggesting
that
this
beer
was
made
with
a
small
brett
component
in
addition
to
the
more
common
souring
techniques
for
berliner
weisse
this
may
have
arisen
through
contamination
from
their
american
wild
ales
or
been
deliberately
added
the
resulting
flavoraroma
seems
out
of
place
in
this
beer
though
it
remains
one
of
the
better
berliner
weissebiers
i
have
had
surprised
this
is
rated
this
low
very
unique
berliner
its
not
on
par
with
ever
weisse
but
certainly
pretty
good
tastes
of
lemonscented
soap
and
chemicals
smells
mildly
of
regurgitated
lowgrade
thai
food
mixed
with
cheap
floor
cleaner
this
beer
is
undrinkable
and
one
of
the
worst
ive
ever
had
sour
but
not
too
harsh
slight
hint
of
lemon
the
flavors
are
strong
and
distinct
lots
of
citrus
ginger
and
lemon
the
ginger
and
lemon
are
fighting
each
other
rather
than
working
together
then
you
add
in
the
citric
acid
and
this
gets
to
be
a
mess
and
disgusting
i
think
there
is
a
good
idea
in
there
but
you
have
to
get
the
ginger
and
lemon
to
play
on
the
same
team
pour
is
a
deeper
yellow
with
a
good
bit
of
white
head
nose
is
huge
musky
sweat
ginger
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
spicy
tang
taste
is
very
sweet
tons
of
sweaty
ginger
tangy
citrus
chlorine
like
mineral
in
the
back
bigger
body
a
bit
juicy
softer
carbonation
the
spice
is
so
strong
i
just
cant
handle
it
extremely
tart
even
for
this
style
batch
15
seems
from
other
reviews
that
this
was
off
much
harsher
than
i
expect
from
a
berliner
the
other
review
comparing
it
to
cider
vinegar
is
apt
though
the
lemongrass
and
a
big
ginger
bite
come
through
its
not
foul
but
its
not
balanced
either
literally
the
sourness
on
first
drink
took
my
breathe
away
and
rendered
me
temporarily
incapable
of
speech
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
had
a
really
overpowering
gingermedicinal
quality
that
just
made
drinking
it
a
chore
might
be
worth
a
try
if
youre
really
into
ginger
but
otherwise
i
would
avoid
im
a
huge
fan
of
sours
but
this
is
one
note
all
the
way
it
would
be
cheaper
to
buy
apple
cider
vinegar
and
drink
that
since
this
is
what
youre
getting
with
somer
weisse
i
dont
know
if
this
batch
went
bad
or
its
meant
to
be
like
this
but
this
isnt
a
refreshing
berliner
weissbier
o
extremely
quaffable
and
refreshing
crisp
light
and
flavorful
allaround
thanks
a
ton
kevin
wow
this
beer
has
a
crazy
amount
of
harsh
acetic
acid
so
much
so
it
destroys
almost
all
of
the
other
flavors
very
strong
acetonesolvent
chemical
flavor
completely
overpowering
everything
else
theres
some
sour
lemon
acidity
and
bready
yeast
as
well
but
they
are
hard
to
pick
up
underneath
all
of
the
solventvinegar
complete
acetone
bomb
with
harsh
rough
solvency
impossible
to
finish
all
but
one
person
at
our
tasting
poured
this
down
the
drainaka
ryans
stomach
oa
good
beer
that
could
become
much
better
if
the
balance
improved
o
wow
i
like
this
beer
maybe
my
favorite
out
of
ma
i
might
no
have
left
had
the
state
been
brewing
beers
like
this
eight
years
ago
sideline
note
i
heard
there
is
plenty
of
batch
variation
here
and
this
one
being
batch
17
seems
to
be
the
most
timid
one
to
date
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
malt
grain
lemon
and
ginger
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
lemon
and
ginger
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
quite
refreshing
nicely
done
but
a
bit
too
damn
sour
for
a
berliner
as
a
sour
head
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
cant
believe
this
is
so
lowly
rated
sure
ever
weiss
and
mainer
weiss
are
better
but
this
beer
is
better
than
people
give
it
credit
for
overall
another
nice
sour
from
nightshift
i
feel
that
this
would
actually
be
a
better
colder
weather
beer
as
opposed
to
a
summer
beer
tart
but
warming
and
still
refreshing
ginger
flaws
this
but
it
is
still
pretty
drinkable
has
that
nice
tart
balance
i
expect
from
the
night
shift
weisses
but
its
so
ginger
heavy
its
distracting
a
perfect
summer
refresher
though
this
is
really
weird
and
really
interesting
there
are
some
huge
lemon
and
ginger
notes
here
with
some
big
funk
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
i
cant
take
all
this
ginger
everything
else
is
pretty
nice
o
fantastic
easily
the
best
berliner
weisse
ive
ever
had
if
this
is
available
to
you
go
buy
it
now
thanks
again
kris
for
this
awesome
extra
odby
far
one
of
the
oddest
beers
i
had
at
night
of
the
funk
first
sip
i
didnt
like
then
the
second
one
grew
on
me
well
worth
a
try
overall
another
great
sour
by
nightshift
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
light
with
still
a
but
of
funkiness
as
well
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
that
fades
very
quickly
smells
of
lemon
ginger
citrus
and
a
little
vinegar
taste
is
lemongrass
and
ginger
and
is
fairly
tart
good
amount
of
carbonation
great
berliner
would
definitely
have
this
again
m
light
bodied
high
carbonation
o
interesting
sour
with
the
ginger
that
adds
a
nice
heat
and
spice
to
a
berliner
o
overall
while
not
a
traditional
berliner
it
is
still
very
nicely
executed
with
the
ingredients
great
for
a
warm
summer
day
o
another
fantastic
sour
from
night
shift
good
for
summertime
drinking
good
for
anytime
drinking
im
sold
a
really
good
beer
nice
in
the
summer
but
drinkable
any
time
the
beer
pours
a
chalky
pale
yellow
with
hints
of
light
orange
and
green
the
beer
pours
with
a
nice
head
of
sodalike
white
bubbles
in
body
the
beer
is
very
cloudy
and
impenetrable
to
the
eye
though
light
and
bubbly
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
beautifully
funky
almost
like
a
lambic
with
leather
and
cherry
hints
beside
bright
citric
lemon
and
a
touch
of
spicy
ginger
the
more
you
stick
your
nose
in
the
beer
the
richer
the
funk
smell
becomes
and
the
more
nuances
you
detect
it
smells
delectable
and
complex
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
tart
and
puckering
with
big
acidity
at
the
forefront
of
the
taste
as
the
beer
moves
over
the
tongue
however
a
nice
balancing
sweetness
blankets
the
tongue
and
cushions
it
from
the
harsher
bite
of
the
acid
faint
herbal
saltiness
can
also
be
detected
on
the
edges
of
the
palate
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
huge
citric
lemon
with
deep
fruity
notes
that
lightly
hint
at
cherry
but
mostly
suggest
the
complexity
of
a
wellcrafted
lemonade
subtle
ginger
spice
tingles
across
the
middle
of
the
swallow
and
brings
some
really
nice
ginger
alelike
flavors
to
the
finish
alongside
tart
lemon
and
light
wheat
flake
flavors
that
quench
down
the
tartness
the
aftertaste
is
lightly
citric
with
lemon
fruit
and
soft
wheat
flake
flavors
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
in
body
but
sharp
in
carbonation
with
a
good
strong
scrub
and
a
solid
pucker
from
the
acid
the
mouth
is
left
with
a
light
ringing
pucker
and
some
nice
balancing
saliva
that
doesnt
completely
flood
the
mouth
with
fluid
overall
this
is
a
supremely
crafted
american
weisse
with
a
great
amount
of
berliner
weisse
in
it
the
citrus
and
wheat
flavor
of
the
classic
berliner
are
still
in
this
beer
but
it
is
far
fruitier
and
more
complex
than
a
traditional
berliner
weisse
making
the
beer
fascinating
to
drink
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
and
makes
one
hell
of
a
summer
beer
try
it
poured
a
cloudy
white
peach
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
layer
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
citrus
musty
mildly
acetic
wellrounded
taste
clean
and
fresh
would
be
good
in
the
summer
though
i
did
have
this
in
the
winter
lemongrass
citrus
zest
a
twinge
of
tartness
pale
malts
and
a
dash
of
gingery
spice
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
very
enjoyable
overall
my
favorite
of
the
ns
brews
i
sampled
overall
this
is
quite
nice
im
not
sure
this
is
a
true
berliner
weiss
but
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
tasty
sour
overall
this
beer
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
clean
simple
combination
of
some
new
ingredients
i
really
look
forward
to
what
night
shift
offers
in
the
future
would
i
buy
it
again
absolutely
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
ginger
but
i
love
me
a
solid
berlinerweisse
and
this
one
delivers
a
little
weird
and
takes
a
bit
getting
used
to
but
it
works
for
some
reason
worth
a
try
this
is
my
second
nighshift
beer
and
im
not
just
impressed
im
in
awe
now
teddie
isnt
the
only
good
thing
to
come
from
everett
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
berlinner
weisse
i
feel
like
the
ginger
and
lemongrass
really
overpower
everything
and
can
become
too
much
too
handle
some
lighter
touch
with
the
spice
notes
would
do
wonders
the
sour
component
is
pretty
nice
but
hardly
ever
shines
definitely
a
unique
beer
unlike
anything
ive
ever
tasted
bottle
shared
with
a
few
friends
thanks
guys
very
cloudy
yellow
color
no
real
head
minimal
lacing
tons
of
ginger
in
the
nose
taste
really
does
hit
you
with
a
load
of
lemongrass
and
ginger
mouthfeel
is
very
tart
yet
refreshing
and
light
love
that
twang
left
on
the
palate
nice
beer
to
sip
but
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
inviting
to
look
at
from
the
beginning
looks
like
pee
appropriate
for
style
i
suppose
smells
like
ginger
overwhelmingly
tastes
like
ginger
and
water
and
a
hint
of
lemon
hops
are
present
only
a
little
but
grassy
sticky
finish
worth
a
mild
tartness
thats
vey
appropriate
for
the
style
malts
and
mouthfeel
medium
rather
than
thin
and
the
5
2
abv
is
a
little
high
still
enjoyable
thigh
especially
for
a
summer
beer
i
hope
they
make
more
of
this
thanks
mike
their
berliner
weiss
also
shines
in
the
flavor
department
i
picked
up
lots
of
citrus
and
ginger
but
also
green
mango
as
well
as
a
mellow
agreeable
sourness
that
i
wanted
to
find
in
the
first
place
mediumbodied
with
some
acidity
somer
weisse
finishes
clean
and
paired
well
with
an
indonesian
rendang
in
general
its
tart
profile
makes
it
a
great
companion
to
southeast
asian
food
great
job
night
shift
o
definitely
sour
but
not
overpoweringly
so
simple
crisp
and
refreshing
combination
of
citrus
and
wheat
good
hot
weather
beer
for
sure
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
rather
flat
but
the
flavor
is
terrific
overall
a
very
nice
and
flavorful
take
on
the
berliner
tastes
quite
similar
to
ng
strawberry
rhubarb
but
with
a
bit
more
funk
in
a
good
way
thanks

finish
shared
at
the
batch
600
release
in
the
swamp
head
parking
lot
pours
orangish
red
colored
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
some
strawberry
and
floral
notes
wheaty
berliner
and
yeasty
sour
notes
flavor
follows
with
lightly
tart
notes
and
strawberry
floral
flavors
wheaty
berliner
finish
is
there
but
subdued
light
bodied
and
high
carbonation
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
this
was
pretty
solid
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
again
thanks
for
the
share
o
i
quite
liked
this
one
a
nicely
down
fruited
bw
really
an
outstanding
beer
that
is
top
notch
all
the
way
through
decent
complexity
and
as
drinkable
as
the
style
should
be
definitely
worth
seeking
out
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
harsh
acidity
and
slight
acetonesolvent
character
very
sour
with
lots
of
funky
bugs
citric
acidity
and
lactic
funk
along
with
some
dry
toothpicky
oak
and
light
fruit
sweetness
hints
of
strawbery
and
cream
with
some
cherry
and
other
sweet
berries
well
integrated
sweetness
and
a
decent
amount
of
sourness
but
this
beer
is
a
bit
harsh
with
too
sting
of
a
solvent
presence
for
my
preference
o
interesting
take
on
a
berliner
fruit
was
much
more
apparent
in
the
nose
than
the
taste
but
was
a
welcome
addition
thinking
that
cellaring
this
one
for
almost
a
year
maybe
wasnt
the
best
idea
was
probably
a
bit
more
balanced
when
the
fruit
was
a
little
more
potent
having
said
that
very
good
take
on
the
style
nice
work
night
shift
o
bright
and
easy
to
drink
kiwi
is
subtle
but
strawberry
adds
a
nice
sweetness
delicious
thanks
again
kevin
a
pretty
good
beer
that
could
be
better
the
sourness
becomes
fatiguing
and
doesnt
allow
the
fruits
to
showcase
themselves
nearly
enough
i
enjoyed
this
but
i
think
it
has
the
opportunity
to
be
a
pretty
great
beer
its
just
not
there
now
this
is
light
bodied
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
unique
and
quite
tart
but
almost
too
bitey
to
the
point
where
it
hinders
the
overall
drinkability
i
think
these
guys
are
on
the
verge
of
greatness
with
their
berliners
the
fruit
combinations
are
fantastic
its
just
a
little
too
sharp
and
the
wild
character
doesnt
always
work
very
interesting
very
complex
sour
berliner
weiss
very
enjoyable
highly
recommend
overall
a
nice
beer
and
close
to
home
to
boot
nicely
wheaty
like
a
berliner
weiss
should
be
but
i
dont
get
much
of
the
fruit
solid
overall
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
pink
hue
with
a
nice
white
head
the
beer
has
great
carbonation
which
helps
my
enjoyment
of
this
style
there
is
only
light
fruit
on
the
nose
loads
of
yogurty
tartness
on
the
nose
the
first
drink
is
fairly
lactic
and
acidic
then
the
fruit
comes
through
very
well
you
get
fresh
strawberry
and
even
a
bit
of
the
kiwi
very
well
made
berliner
with
plenty
of
tartness
but
good
fruit
flavor
pours
a
nice
pinkish
with
very
little
haziness
and
a
one
inch
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smell
is
strawberry
and
kiwi
some
lactic
sourness
and
hint
of
the
hibiscus
taste
is
pretty
tart
and
dry
i
get
some
of
the
strawberry
and
kiwi
a
little
lemon
mouthfeel
is
lighter
with
medium
to
high
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
very
clean
and
refreshing
overall
i
dont
love
the
sourness
in
this
kinda
weird
decent
fruit
though
m
light
bodied
high
carbonation
clears
palate
mildly
hazy
pink
color
reminiscent
of
grapefruit
juice
with
a
frothy
light
pink
head
that
dissipates
relatively
rapidly
without
much
lace
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
mostly
strawberries
with
a
lot
of
noticeable
lactic
sourness
and
a
good
amount
of
brett
mustiness
the
flavor
on
the
other
hand
look
out
this
thing
is
mouthpuckeringly
sour
strawberry
and
kiwi
are
prevalent
with
tons
of
sour
acidity
at
the
finish
an
earthy
floral
taste
comes
out
that
may
be
the
hibiscus
and
an
earthy
musty
and
funky
flavor
that
has
to
be
some
brett
the
mouthfeel
is
tough
to
appreciate
just
because
this
thing
is
so
sour
but
its
lightmediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
while
this
is
too
sour
to
fit
into
the
berliner
weisse
category
it
is
a
delicious
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
ahold
of
it
especially
after
seeing
brewery
only
on
the
label
thank
you
so
so
much
for
giving
me
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
jared
cheers
o
this
is
a
tart
berliner
that
has
a
nice
sweet
and
fruit
presence
that
balances
but
does
not
diminish
the
tartness
youd
expect
from
a
berliner
d
this
was
quite
enjoyable
and
i
could
imagine
having
many
a
glass
on
a
hot
summer
day
perhaps
a
bit
too
sour
for
stylistic
authenticity
but
a
very
nice
fruited
american
sour
ale
otherwise
will
have
to
keep
night
shift
on
my
radar
as
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
this
was
a
great
summer
beer
pleasantly
tangy
sweet
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
o
very
good
and
enjoyable
sour
beer
i
would
call
this
a
bit
too
sour
to
fit
well
into
the
berliner
weiss
category
nice
fruity
flavors
to
complement
the
sour
touch
of
funk
just
a
very
good
sour
beer
this
stuff
is
simply
awesome
beautiful
hazy
bright
ruby
red
with
a
frothy
but
shortlived
light
pink
head
huge
aromas
of
fresh
fruit
yeast
and
funk
crazy
carbonation
probably
one
of
the
most
carbonated
beers
ive
ever
had
in
a
good
way
great
flavor
and
fantastic
body
you
get
the
strawberries
kiwi
and
hibiscus
if
you
search
hard
enough
i
could
drink
this
every
day
for
many
days
at
a
time
refreshing
delicious
sour
wellcrafted
high
quality
beer
in
general
and
even
better
for
the
style
d
wish
i
had
more
than
the
one
bottle
a
wonderful
light
refreshing
complex
brew
the
fruit
and
added
flavors
work
wonderfully
and
add
great
complexity
found
this
at
bermans
in
arlington
couple
of
bottles
left
comes
to
the
table
a
light
pinkamber
color
with
an
almost
no
existent
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
funky
and
a
bit
lactic
with
lots
of
strawberry
dripping
through
my
nose
hairs
the
flavor
is
lightly
fruity
with
strawberries
and
hints
of
sour
cherries
poking
through
lightly
sweet
brown
sugar
and
a
whole
lot
of
lactic
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
i
typically
dont
enjoy
a
berliner
but
gussied
up
with
strawberry
and
kiwi
and
it
works
for
me
i
enjoyed
this
with
some
brisket
and
a
vinegar
sauce
ordered
from
the
sour
reserve
program
and
picked
up
by
caguiar65
thanks
chris
enjoyed
from
a
night
shift
wine
glass
brew
pours
a
majestic
ruby
with
a
nice
fizzy
head
that
fizzed
away
almost
immediately
leaving
spotty
lacing
at
best
great
pinkish
orange
color
smell
is
soft
soury
egg
with
fruit
you
definitely
get
the
strawberry
and
kiwi
with
hints
of
floral
notes
subtle
sourness
flavor
matches
the
nose
with
great
fruitiness
and
just
the
right
amount
of
eggy
funk
and
floral
almost
brett
like
sweetness
super
easy
drinker
and
a
pleasure
in
this
beautiful
summer
day
really
glad
to
have
another
bottle
and
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
hopefully
get
a
chance
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
to
enjoy
all
summer
cheers
night
shift
well
done
o
awesome
so
sour
and
fresh
and
fruity
good
for
june
i
like
that
it
reflects
the
season
for
the
ingredients
my
favorite
weisse
from
night
shift
to
date
tart
and
funky
but
uses
fruit
to
great
effect
planning
on
cleaning
up
with
a
case
on
the
next
release
could
drink
an
entire
bottle
but
it
would
probably
crack
your
tongue
ever
weisse
is
an
amazingly
interesting
and
complex
berliner
weisse
that
makes
terrific
use
of
the
added
flavors
this
breweryonly
release
is
reason
enough
to
make
the
trip
to
night
shift
overall
really
good
beer
for
a
fruit
sour
but
as
a
berliner
weiss
its
not
quite
there
im
all
for
pushing
the
bounds
of
styles
but
this
is
way
too
far
out
there
very
very
barely
even
resembling
a
berliner
weiss
but
as
a
sour
strawberry
beer
its
awesome
o
overall
i
fucking
loved
this
beer
so
much
berry
with
this
brew
its
a
potent
fruit
but
works
nicely
with
this
style
very
drinkable
rush
i
could
have
gotten
more
of
this
o
this
is
my
first
beer
from
night
shift
and
i
am
really
impressed
i
will
definitely
be
back
at
this
brewery
as
for
their
beer
itself
it
does
live
up
to
my
expections
but
it
does
not
blow
me
away
the
strawberry
and
kiwi
flavors
are
there
but
i
wish
it
was
not
so
harsh
and
vinegary
with
that
being
said
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
o
huh
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
great
berliner
its
tart
and
funky
but
not
horrifying
has
enough
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
somewhat
but
not
completely
strawberry
and
kiwi
are
great
fruits
for
such
a
concoction
i
think
great
job
night
shift
beer
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
pink
almost
like
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
it
pours
with
a
fizzy
eggshell
white
head
of
big
soapy
bubbles
that
fades
away
slowly
the
head
leaves
a
very
light
lacing
of
thin
sticky
bubbles
that
form
clouds
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
beers
body
seems
clean
of
particles
but
hazy
with
no
site
of
the
other
side
of
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
like
ripe
and
jammy
strawberry
it
is
thick
on
the
nose
and
beautifully
fruity
and
though
it
is
one
dimensional
with
pure
strawberry
and
maybe
just
a
kiss
of
citric
kiwi
it
is
still
a
big
and
beautiful
smell
that
is
rich
and
complicated
in
its
own
right
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
tartly
acidic
and
then
fruity
sweet
with
a
lingering
pucker
but
no
traces
of
bitterness
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
puckering
citric
sour
but
then
blossoms
into
huge
strawberry
flavors
with
touches
of
fuzzy
sweet
kiwi
fruit
and
a
very
faint
hint
of
savory
hibiscus
the
finish
and
aftertaste
bring
more
of
the
subtle
hibiscus
flavors
into
the
mouth
alongside
ripe
strawberry
skin
and
acidic
kiwi
fruit
the
malt
in
this
of
course
is
light
but
does
give
a
faint
touch
of
grainy
breadiness
the
aftertaste
softly
rings
with
lingering
hibiscus
and
even
fainter
touches
of
strawberry
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
sharply
citric
but
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
the
real
weight
in
the
beers
body
comes
from
the
real
fruit
that
was
added
to
the
beer
and
which
oddly
enough
can
be
felt
as
a
slight
graininess
on
the
tongue
the
carbonation
is
sharp
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
working
to
keep
in
order
the
massive
ripe
and
sweet
fruit
flavors
of
the
beer
and
it
achieves
this
nicely
the
mouth
is
left
puckering
from
the
sourness
of
the
beer
and
also
begging
for
more
beer
overall
this
is
a
beautiful
example
of
the
burgeoning
american
weisse
style
it
is
fruity
sour
and
very
refreshing
while
still
being
puckeringly
refreshing
this
beer
tastes
great
it
is
what
all
fruit
beers
should
be
with
its
beautiful
fresh
fruit
flavors
and
its
thirst
quenching
beer
touches
try
this
beer
for
sure
oda
really
neat
brew
beautiful
looking
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
may
not
be
the
most
complex
sour
but
the
combo
of
kiwi
and
strawberry
is
pretty
awesome
a
treat
overall
pretty
nice
twist
on
a
berliner
weisse
the
fruit
addition
and
hibiscus
is
coil
as
it
gets
will
look
more
for
this
in
the
future
i
love
fruited
berliners
and
this
is
a
really
stellar
example
of
an
oft
overlooked
style
wish
it
were
made
in
larger
quantities
absolutely
seek
it
out
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
berry
and
floral
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruity
and
acidic
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
super
easy
to
drink
would
i
buy
it
again
absolutely
o
this
was
a
nice
surprise
from
a
local
brewery
thats
still
fairly
new
to
the
craft
beer
scene
in
my
opinion
this
is
definitely
the
best
beer
theyve
brewed
yet
and
a
nice
berliner
i
definitely
recommend
checking
it
out
if
you
like
sours
o
a
great
release
from
the
upstart
brewery
apparently
they
only
brewed
one
batch
so
i
feel
lucky
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
they
were
selling
it
at
a
local
tasting
event
delicious
and
balanced
complex
enough
to
savor
but
refreshing
enough
to
satisfy
one
of
the
best
weisses
ive
had
beautiful
but
something
in
the
nose
is
very
very
odd
most
beautiful
beer
ive
seen
in
a
while
something
was
a
tiny
bit
off
in
the
nose
though
sadly
a
lot
of
vinegar
and
cinnamon
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cranberry
juice
with
a
loose
head
that
dissipates
into
a
tight
band
around
the
shoulders
the
nose
pretty
much
smells
like
potpourri
the
taste
on
this
beer
is
weird
i
feel
like
im
drinking
one
of
those
spiced
candle
tart
warmers
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
an
even
carbonation
and
a
slight
astringency
overall
i
love
the
style
because
of
its
subtleties
however
this
beer
lacked
those
aspects
hopefully
it
was
just
an
offbatch
i
love
the
night
shift
berliner
series
and
this
beer
is
a
great
representative
of
it
fruit
forward
good
balance
and
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
trying
very
good
moderately
sour
light
fruit
beautiful
color
bottle
like
ever
weisse
by
them
this
beer
is
absolutely
gorgeous
pours
a
reddish
purple
body
is
clear
almost
the
color
of
pinot
noir
blueberry
juice
color
for
sure
soft
airy
head
that
fizzles
away
quickly
the
color
is
a
pretty
pinkish
purple
the
aroma
brings
forth
some
incoming
tartness
acidic
scent
tart
fruit
some
wheat
that
reminds
me
of
a
blueberry
pie
or
other
blueberry
pastry
soft
cinnamon
almost
unnoticeable
at
first
when
very
cold
the
bottle
tells
me
to
drink
it
at
45
degrees
so
i
patiently
wait
for
it
to
warm
up
and
the
aroma
becomes
more
intense
slightly
less
sour
and
displays
more
cinnamon
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
a
big
zap
of
tart
berries
not
just
a
blueberry
flavor
its
a
unripe
berry
medley
its
very
sour
acidity
is
very
high
leaving
my
lips
tasting
sour
as
well
the
cinnamon
is
soft
at
first
but
grows
with
warmth
finishes
with
a
pastry
wheatiness
that
complements
the
berries
not
sure
what
batch
this
is
but
the
label
says
5
6
and
was
bottles
on
122214
body
is
light
and
its
fairly
dry
high
carbonation
lingering
tartness
i
thought
this
one
was
a
great
success
their
weisse
series
has
been
great
and
more
than
makes
up
for
a
few
duds
along
the
road
drank
a
batch
7
bottled
11182013
on
192015
had
lost
all
of
its
bluepurple
color
and
was
a
golden
color
instead
thus
the
low
appearance
score
and
was
excessively
lactic
with
out
any
discernible
fruit
flavor
was
still
a
nice
if
extremely
sour
berliner
weisse
but
was
not
special
as
expected
overall
got
to
love
how
the
sweet
maine
blueberries
balance
out
the
tart
and
pucker
notes
definitely
worth
trying
this
one
again
a
little
more
cinnamon
character
would
be
good
since
it
was
hard
to
detect
vinegar
not
great
slightly
watery
reminded
of
blueberry
yogurt
didnt
really
pick
up
on
the
cinnamon
sticks
very
interesting
and
look
forward
to
trying
it
in
the
future
overall
refreshing
beer
in
multiple
senses
do
not
know
who
else
brews
anything
similar
or
would
as
well
with
the
task
serving
type
bottle
pour
is
faintly
hazed
pure
orange
with
no

nose
has
a
ton
of
plastic
very
off
aromas
odd
spice
def
not
cinnamon
no
blueberry
in
the
nose
whatsoever
tons
of
acetic
taste
is
root
beer
that
burns
faint
cinnamon
plastic
sweet
sugars
and
citric
acid
high
carb
heavier
body
extremely
sour
and
burning
around
the
outside
of
the
mouth
tart
and
puckering
with
strong
sour
acidity
and
slight
acetone
character
not
too
harsh
or
solvent
like
though
spicy
cinnamon
adds
a
nice
touch
to
the
breadyeast
wheat
and
acidic
flavors
slight
mineral
quality
in
the
finish
but
again
im
not
picking
up
much
blueberry
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
the
cinnamon
is
a
nice
touch
and
a
unique
take
on
the
style
slightly
harsh
but
decently
drinkable
disappointed
by
this
new
release
tasted
fishy
to
me
overall
too
intense
in
the
wrong
areas
for
me
berliners
are
night
shift
doing
what
they
do
best
and
this
is
no
exception
despite
the
lack
of
blueberries
the
play
between
tart
and
cinnamon
was
unique
and
pleasant
o
this
is
the
second
berliner
weiss
of
theirs
that
ive
tried
and
i
really
really
like
them
an
outstanding
new
england
beer
o
an
excellent
and
refreshing
sipper
clean
flavorful
and
smooth
overall
blueberry
isnt
prominent
but
the
cinnamon
adds
an
interesting
touch
thanks
again
autumnbeerlove
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
very
sour
brew
yet
fruity
and
uniqueinteresting
the
acedic
aspects
coupled
with
brine
and
vinegar
make
this
more
harsh
than
drinkable
unfortunately
easier
to
enjoy
all
the
individual
flavour
components
compared
to
somer
weiss
which
was
less
complex
very
acidic
and
tart
for
the
berliner
style
which
i
really
dont
mind
would
recommend
this
over
somer
weiss
and
fallen
apple
but
ever
weiss
is
the
best
of
them
all

tart
apple

feel
is
medium

with
a

not
nearly
overly
sour
but
more
spiced
than
i
would
have
thought
tasty
early
afternoon
drinker
but
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
blueberry
notes
as
noted
in
my
introduction
this
was
the
last
of
three
bottles
of
mainer
weisse
purchased
at
the
brewery
release
party
in
midoctober
while
i
enjoyed
the
first
and
second
bottles
i
found
them
to
be
almost
tonguebucklingly
sour
with
the
potency
of
the
sourness
overshadowing
the
complexity
of
the
beers
other
flavors
with
the
extra
bit
of
time
on
this
particular
bottle
however
some
of
that
brash
sourness
has
disappeared
allowing
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
to
come
out
of
hiding
and
have
their
turn
in
the
spotlight
a
tart
refreshing
and
nuanced
berliner
very
nice
night
shift
very
nice
indeed
sweet
and
tart
to
me
one
of
their
tartest
i
thought
the
cinnamon
worked
well
this
is
quite
a
charming
berliner
weiss
its
tart
and
funky
with
some
nice
blueberry
notes
at
times
this
kind
of
walks
the
line
between
a
sour
and
a
berliner
weiss
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
its
my
definition
of
a
dessert
beer
tart
but
the
cinnamon
adds
a
nice
element
that
evokes
some
kind
of
blueberry
dessert
delightful
and
assertively
tart
overall
its
hard
to
drink
it
has
so
much
sour
and
acidic
bite
nice
tartness
and
funk
a
bit
too
much
on
the
gym
sock
funk
too
nice
tart
fruit
but
not
a
lot
of
blueberry
just
so
hard
to
really
like
this
despite
how
good
it
could
be
beautiful
pink
body
this
beer
looks
like
a
peeled
blueberry
i
was
very
excited
to
get
into
this
beer
all
i
got
on
the
nose
and
from
the
taste
was
unripened
blueberry
tartness
this
one
was
a
little
more
acidic
than
i
would
expect
from
a
fruited
berliner
my
favorite
part
of
the
taste
was
the
finish
of
slightly
sweetened
cinnamon
on
the
very
back
end
i
kept
drinking
just
for
that
it
was
so
interesting
i
was
hoping
for
more
blueberry
and
less
lemony
tartness
in
the
taste
personally
the
beer
pours
a
murky
pinkishyellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
but
does
leave
a
nice
ring
of
white
bubbles
around
the
glass
the
head
leaves
a
thin
stringy
lacing
around
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
opaque
and
cloudy
on
the
nose
this
beer
smells
of
tart
lemon
green
apple
and
yogurt
there
is
a
faint
touch
of
blueberry
indiscriminate
spice
and
wheat
flakes
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
very
tart
and
acidic
with
just
a
wisp
of
sweet
fruitiness
and
not
much
else
as
the
beer
warms
the
harshness
mellows
slightly
but
this
beer
is
not
very
balanced
and
leans
too
heavily
on
its
sourness
compared
to
other
weisses
that
night
shift
offers
this
beer
is
a
little
out
of
whack
in
flavor
the
beer
tastes
sour
apple
sour
lemon
yogurt
and
chalk
the
faintest
touch
of
blueberry
can
be
sensed
but
i
honestly
think
that
is
because
i
know
there
is
blueberry
in
the
beer
no
cinnamon
can
be
sensed
but
i
do
pick
touches
of
indiscriminate
hot
spice
on
the
tongue
the
finish
is
quick
and
muted
with
sour
fruit
and
the
aftertaste
is
of
puckering
lemon
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
carbonation
is
a
little
fiercer
than
a
medium
level
but
the
beer
is
puckering
and
fierce
in
mouthfeel
with
a
touch
of
slickness
the
mouth
is
left
full
of
saliva
and
puckering
from
the
sour
shock
of
this
beer
overall
i
am
disappointed
with
this
beer
night
shift
has
really
impressed
me
in
the
past
with
their
sour
futures
program
and
the
fruited
weisses
that
they
can
pump
out
this
beer
however
is
just
too
sour
the
acid
bulls
over
any
other
nuance
that
the
beer
might
have
and
makes
the
beer
harder
to
drink
night
shift
usually
does
an
amazing
job
of
bringing
fresh
fruit
flavors
into
their
beer
but
they
missed
the
mark
with
this
vintage
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
but
its
a
little
too
unbalanced
for
me
this
beer
pours
a
blueish
purple
color
with
a
pink
head
the
smell
is
lactic
sour
with
a
definite
blueberry
smell
and
hints
of
cinnamon
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
sourness
coming
through
the
most
with
hints
of
blueberry
and
just
a
touch
of
cinnamon
i
was
not
sure
how
cinnamon
was
going
to
work
in
this
sour
but
it
integrated
really
well
with
the
blueberries
the
mouthfeel
is
lite
dry
very
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
while
not
a
traditional
take
on
the
style
i
am
beginning
to
enjoy
the
fruited
berliners
more
and
more
just
saves
the
time
of
adding
syrup
o
very
well
crafted
berliner
love
night
shifts
entire
weisse
series
and
this
is
no
exception
dry
tart
and
fruity
love
the
cranberries
in
this
looks
like
cheap
flavored
vodka
but
tastes
great
tart
clean
wonderful
pour
is
insanely
cloudy
and
murky
dark
peach
with
pale
peach
edges
and
a
white
head
nose
has
a
bit
of
lactic
acid
musky
fruits
light
rubber
faint
berry
taste
is
cleaner
just
a
hint
of
lacto
cream
lots
of
peach
skin
mixed
with
hint
of
tart
cranberry
creamy
body
moderate
carbonation
not
really
dry
body
is
a
bit
creamy
beautiful
hazy
pink
body
that
had
loads
of
head
as
this
bottle
was
a
gusher
like
so
many
from
the
2014
batch
have
been
the
smell
is
pretty
yogurty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
fairly
one
note
loads
of
lactic
tartness
and
yogurty
flavor
you
get
a
slight
hint
of
cranberry
at
the
very
back
end
when
this
warms
a
bit
the
tartness
is
dialed
back
a
bit
this
season
from
ns
on
this
berliner
but
there
are
just
so
many
better
berliners
on
the
market
i
wanted
something
beyond
lactic
tartness
and
a
bit
more
fruit
there
are
a
lot
of
great
nonfruited
berliners
available
so
the
fruit
really
needs
to
shine
in
my
opinion
overall
really
good
stuff
the
cranberries
are
integrated
very
well
with
the
base
beer
and
add
some
additional
complexity
without
overwhelming
the
base
beer
drinkability
is
insanely
high
as
well
i
could
and
likely
will
kill
the
entire
750ml
in
fairly
short
order

o
overall
another
winner
in
the
weisse
category
for
night
shift
these
beers
are
all
great
pours
a
murky
light
red
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
malt
grain
cranberry
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
grain
and
cranberry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
slightly
sour
cranberry
aspect
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
pours
the
color
of
ruby
grapefruit
juice
with
a
hazy
clarity
and
a
voluminous
pinktinted
head
nose
expresses
yeast
bready
notes
and
a
suggestion
of
citrus
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
tart
cranberry
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
quite
a
bit
of
astringency
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
i
prefer
my
berlinnerweissbiers
a
bit
cleaner
and
lemony
overall
this
is
the
final
nightshift
berlinner
weiss
that
i
have
yet
to
try
out
of
these
seasonal
nightshift
brews
this
is
the
2nd
best
only
behind
ever
weiss
nightshift
and
made
some
unique
berlinner
weisse
beer
and
it
was
an
awesome
ride
getting
to
try
all
4
of
these
seasonal
beers
by
nightshift
nightshift
is
a
great
east
coast
brewery
for
sure
they
make
some
of
my
favorite
berlinner
weisse
beers
brewed
in
the
usa
this
is
a
great
berliner
weiss
to
start
and
the
cranberries
adds
some
nice
flavor
this
is
nicely
tart
and
nicely
refreshing
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
easy
drinking
and
light
closer
to
a
real
berliner
than
the
other
night
shift
weisses
soft
and
solid
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pinkish
red
with
an
opaque
body
and
a
tiny
spritzy
head
of
white
bubbles
there
seems
to
be
white
cloudy
pulp
within
the
beers
haze
which
i
suspect
is
just
the
particles
of
cranberry
and
orange
peel
the
beer
smells
excellently
citrusy
with
a
lactopop
and
a
touch
of
yogurt
it
also
sports
a
nice
touch
of
cranberry
though
that
is
regrettably
muddled
with
the
citrus
scents
strong
scents
of
wheat
flakes
come
through
as
well
heralding
the
amped
up
malt
bill
that
was
used
for
this
beer
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
beautifully
tart
and
acidic
with
a
light
fruity
sweet
balance
that
helps
the
beer
to
pop
in
the
mouth
but
not
pucker
in
comparison
to
mainer
weisse
night
shifts
last
weisse
release
the
sour
is
much
more
under
control
and
balanced
and
the
flavors
are
just
beautiful
this
beer
sits
very
close
to
a
classic
berliner
in
my
mind
but
also
has
the
terrific
fruit
funk
that
establishes
it
as
an
american
weisse
the
beer
features
strong
lemon
flavors
that
morph
into
beautiful
orange
juice
with
a
pop
of
tart
cranberry
lime
and
just
a
touch
of
plastic
acidity
that
i
sometimes
find
in
fruited
weisses
running
strongly
underneath
all
these
flavors
and
building
as
you
sip
is
the
delicious
flavor
of
wheat
flakes
which
is
far
stronger
than
in
any
other
night
shift
weisse
this
wheat
flavor
blends
with
the
fresh
fruit
and
provides
a
jammy
taste
though
not
as
much
so
as
everweisse
did
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
heavy
side
of
light
in
body
with
a
strong
carbonation
and
effervescence
that
adds
to
the
beers
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
more
weight
than
most
other
weisses
ive
tried
but
i
like
that
and
wish
more
of
the
american
weisses
sported
this
weight
on
the
tongue
the
subtle
jam
flavors
are
also
delicious
and
while
the
cranberry
is
a
bit
light
in
overall
flavor
i
still
love
its
additions
as
well
as
the
orange
peels
this
is
another
great
american
weisse
from
night
shift
and
one
that
i
would
happily
sip
in
the
heat
of
summer

means
youll
last

had
this
in

at

in

yes
bells
you
nailed
it
it
doesnt
light
the
world
on
fire
but
it
doesnt
need
to
an
excellent
example
of
crafting
beer
with
finesse
decent
beer
but
i
have
enjoyed
other
berliners
much
more
mildly
sour
but
not
heavy
love
it
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
very
pale

nearly
clear
smells
light
slight
sour

effervescent
wheat
flavor
and
a
little
green
apple

sessionable
too
we
have
a
winner
id
place
this
somewhere
between
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
a
true
berliner
weisse
bells
gets
major
props
for
packaging
this
in
six
packs
not
many
other
breweries
that
distribute
to
my
area
do
so
this
goes
down
easy
for
those
hot
summer
days
of
which
we
have
a
lot
in
southern
california
and
it
is
extremely
thirst
quenching
wheat
slight
tart
lemon
flavor
and
a
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
slightly
tart
finish
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
if
youre
expecting
tons
of
flavors
look
elsewhere
actually
dont
you
should
still
try
this
and
maybe
open
your
palate
up
to
the
subtle
finesse
of
a
nicely
executed
beer
that
wont
destroy
you
in
100
degree
heat
and
pairs
excellently
with
any
food
not
my
favorite
style
doesnt
work
for
me
o
good
taste
a
very
easy
light
drinker
with
some
complexity
from
the
sourness
would
make
an
excellent
summer
beer
overall
it
rings
true
on
some
notes
but
falls
flat
on
others
not
really
sour
enough
to
be
called
a
berliner
weisse
more
of
a
light
american
wheat
beer
very
refreshing
good

the

from

beautifully

easy

sour
if
i
had
one
complaint
i
would
say
that
it
the
flavor
doesnt
last
just
drink
and
taste
and
then
gone
not
a
bad
thing
especially
when
coupled
with
food
just
seems
a
but
thin
just
ok
probably
never
drink
again
just
not

really

good

loved

this

then
never

again
my

picked
this

up

in

a
wonderful
session
beer
in

very
balanced
and
flavorful
could
have
this
beer
anytime
anywhere
any
reason
if
there
is
anything
to
knock
it
its
only
because
of
fizziness
in
the
body
and
the
finish
is
a
touch
on
the
dry
side
and
not
as
smooth
and
cleansing
as
some
other
ones
from
same

ive
always
read
about
this
and
was
curious
scored
some
at
a
backwoods
fire
and
believe
this
would
be
a
summer
refresher
for
next
year
but
hey
it
sure
did
work
here
in
early
autumn
deep
in

pours
a

of
a

weisse
it
is
lemony
dry
tart
and
refreshing
it
lacks
1809s
barnyard
funk
and
the
carbonation
is
not
quite
as
champagne
like
or
tart
as
the
two
german
interpretations
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
much
cheaper
than
either
german
beer
for
someone
looking
for
something
light
refreshing
and
not
a
traditional
american
light
lager
this
is
worth
a
try
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
spend
a
day
on
a
boat
with
a
12
oz
pour
at
world
of
beers
in
cary
nc
on
91814
while
the
look
and
feel
appear
to
be
on
the
smell
and
taste
are
where
this
beer
is
lacking
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
very
muted
in
particular
there
is
less
citrus
and
acid
than
one
would
expect
from
this
style
while
it
drinks
very
clean
from
start
to
end
the
flavor
seems
to
fade
toward
the
finish
very
light
reminiscent
of
a
gose
with
less
tartness
certainly
no
berliner
the
beer
pours
white
and
small
bubbles
as
part
of
the
head
but
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
hazy
and
a
pale
straw
color
the
beer
has
a
tart
smell
mixed
with
a
banana
yeast
notes
and
orange
hop
notes
however
the
smell
appears
to
be
a
little
weak
the
taste
has
a
strong
sourtart
note
with
banana
notes
from
the
yeast
the
orange
hop
flavor
is
still
present
but
each
of
the
notes
taste
a
bit
watery
the
beers
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
and
light
bodied
with
smooth
and
light
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
but
falls
to
the
trap
that
the
style
needs
something
else
and
stronger
to
make
it
good
o
well
done
brew
though
nothing
overly
defining
about
it
craft
beer
berliner
meets
assembly
line
leaving
a
minimalist
brew
to
style
that
is
refreshing
and
smooth
without
abrasive
characteristics
i
love
that
its
sessionable
and
somewhat
accessible
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
least
tart
berliners
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
this
is
not
detrimental
but
i
think
even
a
hint
more
tarts
would
do
wonders
solid
but
suprassed
by
other
modern
examples
of
this
style
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
rated
to
style
its
abv
and
hoppiness
is
too
high
for
a
berliner
weisse
and
its
missing
the
big
fruity
bananalike
esters
of
an
american
pale
wheat
or
a
hefeweizen
wherever
it
lies
stylistically
its
drinkable
but
far
from
exceptional
i
guess
some
people
just
dont
understand
this
type
of
beer
it
achieves
everything
id
want
in
a
summer
beer
light
drinkable
yet
still
offering
a
number
of
diverse
flavors
its
damn
goodd
and
dont
let
anyone
tell
you
different
o
refreshing
berliner
weisse
great
overall
beer
refreshing
sour
for
the
summertime
a
light
ale
appearance
with
a
nice
sour
bite
at
the
end
something
i
could
drink
a
few
of
and
not
have
trouble
im
new
to
trying
sour
beers
and
this
one
is
making
me
a
fan
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
a
hot
day
a
big
fan
of
bells
brewery
and
will
be
buying
this
beer
again
this
had
no
visible
carbonation
but
was
very
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
it
was
easily
sessionable
and
was
fuller
than
the
watery
complexion
o
an
awesome
summer
brew
and
is
so
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
goes
down
easy
and
is
light
so
you
wont
get
tanked
overall
pretty
sure
this
is
my
first
berliner
weiss
and
i
gotta
say
im
digging
it
really
nice
lemon
zing
that
comes
across
as
very
genuine
perfect
summer
brew
corona
with
lime
wedge
eat
your
heart
out
not
the
best
berliner
weiss
out
there
but
a
good
showing
from
bells
especially
considering
the
low
price
and
high
availability
in
my
area
this
would
be
nice
to
drink
all
day
long
at
the
beach
very
sessionable
and
very
refreshing
ill
probably
buy
this
again
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
sunday
a
solid
brew
from
bells
and
one
of
the
better
brews
from
them
truly
a
good
summer
brew
compared
to
their
oberon
o
this
is
a
very
solid
berliner
and
i
suspect
very
close
to
the
traditional
style
theres
only
hints
of
tartness
as
opposed
to
outright
sour
acidity
bouquet
and
flavor
are
very
similar
to
a
german
pilsner
but
the
lacto
tartness
and
the
wheat
lend
a
creaminess
more
appropriate
of
the
berliner
style
the
reviews
on
this
are
understandably
muted
this
is
so
easy
drinking
so
straight
forward
and
so
wellintegrated
that
it
almost
comes
off
boring
but
its
anything
but
this
is
a
wonderful
piece
of
first
class
craft
and
an
absolute
treat
for
the
warmer
months
in
a
world
of
over
the
top
sours
oarsman
aims
for
classic
simplicity
and
makes
its
mark
cheers
o
not
bad
just
lacking
the
amount
of
character
needed
for
it
to
be
a
repeat
buy
the
buzz
word
sour
made
me
go
for
this
one
pours
piss
yellow
more
neon
than
a
bmc
brew
smell
is
almost
nonexistant
but
it
honestly
smells
like
puke
the
flavor
is
better
than
the
nose
but
its
mostly
lemon
like
the
sour
part
of
lemon
not
necessarily
the
citrus
flavor
anyway
this
could
be
refreshing
if
i
was
sweating
my
ass
off
on
a
hot
day
but
it
wasnt
exactly
the
best
way
to
end
the
night
after
having
a
few
beers
overall
ill
definitely
enjoy
this
brew
again
good
for
a
springsummer
brew
and
can
have
a
few
with
its
light
abv
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
clear
yellow
color
plenty
of
bubbles
and
a
foamy
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
lemon
and
wheat
taste
is
lemon
wheat
and
a
nice
touch
of
tartness
the
beer
has
a
light
to
medium
body
feel
and
crisply
refreshing
this
was
a
surprise
to
me
i
was
expecting
something
light
and
uninteresting
but
got
something
much
more
enjoyable
pours
gold
in
appearance
with
a
small
white
head
served
in
a
pint
glass
overall
a
light
refreshing
berliner
weiss
perfect
for
a
hot
day
it
could
have
been
a
bit
more
flavorful
but
its
still
solid
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
the
sour
taste
is
exactly
what
i
like
of
course
i
didnt
know
it
until
i
tasted
it
i
have
drank
a
good
number
of
these
beers
and
a
little
pre
drink
advice
before
you
pop
the
top
flip
the
beer
upside
down
and
tilt
it
and
spin
it
to
get
all
the
goodies
off
the
bottom
it
makes
the
first
drink
as
sour
as
the
last
on
the
whole
an
uncomplicated
but
refreshing
and
sessionable
beer
that
i
fear
i
have
not
done
justice
to
by
waiting
to
drink
it
as
it
stands
this
was
a
perfectly
pleasant
drinking
experience
but
id
love
to
revisit
a
fresher
bottle
at
some
point
taste
is
very
simple
and
straight
forward
crisp
and
effervescent
tart
lemon
and
a
light
grain
sweetness
it
is
not
mouth
puckering
but
it
is
dry
and
palate
cleansing
its
mild
and
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
a
perfect
beer
for
a
warm
day
for
the
beach
a
lawnmower
beer
light
and
drinks
so
very
easily
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
gold
color
body
with
a
fizzy
head
to
it
the
aroma
has
a
light
maltyness
to
it
the
taste
has
a
tart
flavor
and
some
sweetness
to
it
it
also
has
a
little
bit
of
malt
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
like
champagne
overall
this
is
i
think
my
first
sour
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
bottom
line
buy
if
youre
looking
for
a
refreshing
and
semitraditional
berliner
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
sours
dont
bother
if
you
easily
have
access
to
other
berliner
weisse
styles
unless
you
wanna
try
a
new
one
overall
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
real
interesting
flavor
that
sets
this
one
apart
from
the
other
session
beers
on
the
market
sure
its
not
as
tart
as
some
berliner
weissbiers
can
be
but
the
malt
backbone
is
solid
enough
to
gain
this
some
more
points
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
perfect
on
a
warm
summer
day
i
enjoy
it
just
fine
on
this
cold
winter
evening
i
dont
know
maybe
its
the
style
that
i
dont
like
way
to
tart
for
me
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
no
head
and
no
lace
the
scent
had
almost
a
chardonnay
flare
the
taste
was
tart
much
like
a
white
wine
the
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
with
subtle
carbonation
overall
its
ok
probably
better
summer
beer
than
a
late
fall
beer
o
a
pleasant
surprise
although
nothing
worldbeating
about
it
im
not
usually
a
sour
beer
fan
but
this
one
was
not
too
bad
and
could
be
really
good
in
the
right
circumstances
a
hot
day
out
on
the
deck
not
the
most
flavorful
of
this
style
that
so
many
brewers
are
making
more
traditionally
and
also
with
decided
american
twists
very
tasty
and
i
recommend
it
if
you
like
this
style
and
prefer
it
less
tart
and
grainy
than
traditionally
brewed
more
lemons
on
the
palate
moderate
puckering
sourtartness
bright
and
fairly
refreshing
also
wheat
hay
and
a
gentle
eartyness
come
to
mind
still
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
could
see
enjoying
another
bottle
of
this
on
a
warm
summer
day
with
some
some
cheese
bread
and
salad
its
scary
how
bad
this
beer
is
ive
tried
it
bottled
on
2
different
occassions
and
i
was
shocked
both
times
at
the
overwhelming
sour
taste
overall
bells
is
one
of
my
top
five
favorite
breweries
but
this
one
is
a
solid
miss
a
definite
drain
pour
on
this
one
o
i
like
the
acidity
while
not
that
complex
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
and
a
nice
alternative
to
a
shandy
o
mild
aromas
but
delivers
on
taste
really
drinkable
with
fun
refreshing
tartness
a
summer
essential
o
what
little
ive
sampled
of
the
style
i
havent
liked
this
is
definitely
the
closest
ive
come
to
liking
a
berliner
it
still
has
its
fair
share
of
flaws
which
keep
that
from
happening
poor
aroma
ugly
look
and
undefined
flavors
mean
im
not
going
to
get

it

to

its

quite
unique

overall
im
new

the

i
do
like
the
1809

better
i
must
say
because
of
its
more
appealing
appearance
and
mouthfeel
this
is

but
it
isnt
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
mouthfeel
is
medium

a

o
a
good
beer
and
i
believe
a
good
example
of
the
style

overall
i
wasnt

with
this
its
certainly
not
bad
by
any

and
if
youre
a
fan
of

its
probably
worth
a

this
wont
be
a

overall
a
tasty

certainly
could
be

nothing

is
not
a
style
that
ive
tried
many
beers
from
but
its
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
rotation
of
ipas
and
porters
ill
definitely
be
drinking
some
more
of
this
one
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
a
super
easy
drinking
beer
could
toss
a
few
back
in
one
sitting
going
to
try
and
add
some
fruit
to
this
the
next
time
to
add
a
little
more
flavor
to
it
and
counteract
some
of
the
sourtart
flavor
to
it
overall
not
very
good
o
a
refreshing
beer
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
o
a
thin
beer
low
on
flavor
i
found
it
about
as
refreshing
as
a
glass
of
water
possibly
a
serviceable
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
i
found
this
one
lacking
in
every
department
o
not
very
tart
for
a
berliner
weissbier
it
kind
of
tastes
more
like
a
wheaty
saison
pale
ale
a
bit
refreshing
but
overall
lackluster
to
me
however
the
age
on
it
might
have
hurt
it
a
bit
o
pretty
straight
forward
classic
berliner
nice
tart
and

characteristics
make
this
a

this
is
a
good
introduction
to
sour
beers
it
refreshes
the
palate
but
isnt
overwhelmingly
sour
it
finishes
crisp
and
clean
it
has
hints
of
ripe
fruit
like
sour
apple
but
still
has
a
grainy
backbone
it
is
great
to
drink
when
the
weather
is
warm
or
if
you
like
a
change
of
pace
from
heavy
stouts
or
hopped
up
ipas
it
wont
knock
you
out
of
your
chair
but
i
think
that
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
definitely
shows
the
characteristics
of
a
berliner
weissbier
while
i
havent
tried
many
of
the
style
im
so
far
not
used
to
their
sour
flavors
making
it
a
bit
difficult
to
gauge
its
quality
overall
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
a
good
beer
to
just
sit
and
sip
aroma
taste
light
malt
and
straw
notes
with
some
grapefruit
and
pineapple
light
fizzy
mouthfeel
with
moderate
acidity
the
acidity
gives
the
beer
a
sour
taste
that
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
overall
this
is
a
great
way
to
get
your
sour
fill
in
a
cheap
and
easy
to
find
beer
great
if
not
ideal
example
of
the
style
the
perfect
summer
lawnmower
beer
if
shandies
arent
your
thing
this
beer
has
a
pleasantly
tart
citrusy
aroma
it
has
a
bright
light
gold
appearance
the
beer
was
at
first
crisp
and
refreshing
followed
with
a
tart
citrus
taste
almost
like
a
weak
lambic
very
light
mouthfeel
makes
it
very
refreshing
and
clean
this
beer
would
be
a
perfect
one
to
end
the
day
with
an
excellent
summer
session
ale
great
to
drink
while
grilling
the
low
avb
will
lead
to
fewer
fires
love
how
light
and
refreshing
it
is
this
beer
makes
a
great
all
day
drinking
beer
since
its
also
a
lighter
abv
an
excellent
starter
sour
beer
for
those
that
arent
too
familiar
with
sours
would
like
to
be
able
to
drink
all
through
the
summer
though
which
sometimes
doesnt
happen
as
its
apparently
a
fall
seasonal
the
fact
that
people
havent
caught
on
to
how
nice
this
sour
is
makes
it
last
longer
at
retail
locations
though
which
is
a
plus
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
lightness
and
ease
of
drinkability
the
aroma
introduced
a
serious
sourness
and
tartness
while
the
flavoring
via
crisp
grain
and
citric
inclusions
smashed
smoothed
and
blended
things
into
a
concise
easy
final
product
no
one
component
ever
became
overwhelming
and
the
wheat
stayed
right
where
it
needed
to
be
to
ensure
the
strength
of
the
base
if
we
are
being
picky
the
flavoring
does
ease
up
a
bit
too
much
at
the
end
of
the
sip
and
at
times
can
feel
watered
through
this
however
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
this
is
one
clean
refreshing
and
sessionable
beer
not
for
me
once
is
enough
the
beer
pours
a
spritzy
golden
orange
with
a
small
egg
shell
white
head
of
tight
bubbles
that
quickly
fizzles
into
a
rim
on
the
glass
the
beers
body
is
misty
but
clear
of
particles
and
chock
full
of
a
torrential
river
of
carbonation
bubbles
that
are
constantly
racing
up
the
glass
for
lacing
the
beer
leaves
small
slippery
strings
that
do
not
stay
on
the
glass
long
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
deeply
of
cereal
wheat
almost
like
a
meaty
wheat
flake
there
is
the
faintest
hint
of
tartness
in
the
beginning
of
the
nose
but
that
is
quickly
eaten
up
by
the
thick
bready
caramel
wheat
smell
that
makes
me
think
this
beer
is
heavier
than
it
is
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
lightly
acidic
with
a
nice
sweet
wheat
malt
roundness
to
the
taste
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
tart
almost
citric
acid
that
washes
quickly
over
the
tongue
and
is
replaced
by
light
chewy
lemon
wheat
bread
without
the
acid
and
a
touch
of
citric
orange
the
finish
is
of
light
lemon
and
orange
water
mixed
in
with
a
touch
of
sweet
wheat
malts
as
the
beer
warms
a
wheat
flake
flavor
does
enter
the
beer
throughout
the
taste
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
tingly
similar
to
how
the
mouth
feels
after
a
light
tea
or
flavored
water
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
a
step
above
light
in
body
with
a
strong
prickly
carbonation
that
never
grows
out
of
control
and
helps
to
punctuate
the
flavor
notes
on
the
palate
the
mouth
is
left
fairly
clean
with
only
the
faintest
feeling
of
carbonation
burn
and
a
touch
of
sticky
malt
candy
covering
the
mouth
overall
this
beer
is
nice
and
could
definitely
be
a
great
all
day
beer
its
light
spritziness
makes
it
refreshing
and
interesting
but
i
kind
of
wish
there
was
more
tartness
to
this
beer
its
simple
and
nice
but
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
and
it
really
just
leaves
me
desiring
a
fuller
flavor
a
great
session
beer
for
sure
if
you
want
something
light
but
you
can
find
more
flavorful
beers
for
the
abv
level
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
expect
more
from
a
worldclass
brewery
like
bells
theres
just
not
much
going
on
here
as
if
oarsman
is
made
to
have
syrup
added
to
it
theres
more
interesting
beers
in
the
style
though
this
is
still
worth
trying
clocking
in
at
4
0
abv
this
is
wonderful
for
drinking
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
effervescent
and
light
enough
to
pair
well
with
the
tartness
the
low
abv
keeps
this
one
being
refreshing
its
my
easytoget
fix
for
my
berliner
cravings
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
standard
shaker
may
2012
pours
a
pale
hay
colored
yellow
with
a
little
haze
to
it
very
thin
head
but
very
active
bubbles
rushing
up
from
the
bottom
smells
heavy
of
yeast
and
fresh
bread
with
a
cutting
smell
of
acid
and
lemon
rind
as
well
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
was
very
clean
like
a
standard
lager
but
with
good
body
and
obvious
wheat
sweetness
to
it
it
did
get
a
little
cloying
after
a
little
bit
and
almost
tasted
like
a
lemon
jolly
rancher
the
abv
says
sessionable
but
it
was
just
a
little
too
sweet
to
me
o
average
berliner
with
very
mild
sourness
and
a
thinner
feel
than
others
i
have
had
verdict
a
bit
lacking
for
such
a
simple
style
the
balance
of
flavors
seems
to
be
a
touch
out
of
whack
and
its
lacking
brightness
and
vibrancy
that
makes
this
style
really
enjoyable
o
was
not
aware
this
is
a
sour
upon
purchasing
that
is
my
fault
for
not
reading
the
back
of
the
bottle
i
just
read
ale
anyhow
i
tried
to
judge
fairly
based
on
the
fact
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
the
initial
pour
did
not
look
like
a
high
end
beer
to
me
the
heavy
carbonation
and
yellow
color
reminded
me
of
a
cheaper
light
beer
the
lack
of
foam
and
lacing
added
to
this
however
actually
tasting
the
beer
turned
it
around
for
me
the
tartness
and
carbonation
played
well
with
each
other
and
created
a
beer
that
is
reminiscent
of
something
like
white
wine
the
aftertaste
and
smell
of
vinegar
are
sort
of
a
turn
off
for
me
i
imagine
that
for
people
that
enjoy
sours
this
is
a
pretty
decent
one
however
it
is
not
for
me
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
not
huge
of
flavor
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
option
for
a
summer
beer
i
am
not
a
flemish
sour
fan
yet
im
still
working
to
develop
a
taste
for
sours
but
the
tartness
of
this
lightlooking
beer
was
just
enough
to
be
interesting
but
not
sour
i
had
a
fourounce
taster
of
the
beer
so
i
dont
know
if
it
would
have
held
my
interest
for
a
full
12
or
16ounce
serving
o
really
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
nice
example
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
creamy
white
head
aromas
of
tart
fruit
and
a
hint
of
vinegar
taste
is
an
initial
sour
tart
fruit
beginning
followed
by
a
light
cracker
middle
and
a
hint
of
earthiness
in
an
otherwise
super
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
abv
overall
a
great
true
session
beer
its
a
shame
there
arent
more
berliner
weiss
available
in
america
o
this
is
my
first
berliner
weissbier
its
definitely
not
my
favorite
style
but
not
bad
at
all
i
prefer
beers
with
more
alcohol
though
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
slightly
sour
up
front
with
a
citrusy
fruit
flavor
lots
of
bread
flavor
in
the
backbone
this
would
be
good
during
the
summer
months
but
right
now
im
not
really
feeling
it
light
body
high
carbonation
sour
yet
refreshing
not
my
favorite
maybe
good
with
a
meal
but
not
just
as
a
casual
drink
1st
time
trying
this
style
its
not
going
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
and
easy
drinker
if
you
dont
mind
the
puckering
sourness
didnt
try
it
with
the
addition
of
flavored
syrup
like
they
do
in
berlin
would
be
interesting
to
see
what
that
does
for
it
i
like
this
one
and
think
bells
has
a
winner
here
overall
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
refreshing
overall
a
very
great
take
on
this
style
probably
buy
a
case
of
this
one
every
year
would
suit
an
acidic
salad
magnificently
a
good
beer
for
food
pairing
in
general
overall
i
think
ive
had
this
before
but
i
couldnt
remember
so
i
picked
it
up
i
doubt
id
pick
it
up
again
but
if
there
were
a
cooler
of
this
at
a
party
id
drink
the
hell
out
of
it
on
a
hot
day
o
very
good
berliner
weiss
but
was
not
surprised
it
was
just
a
tad
too
grainy
i
read
the
description
of
the
style
which
says
tourists
in
berlin
will
often
order
on
as
a
berliner
weisse
mit
schuss
himbeere
luckily
we
have
raspberry
syrup
lying
around
the
house
about
one
tablespoon
or
little
less
is
just
perfect
it
cuts
the
sourness
i
put
the
syrup
in
the
glass
and
pour
the
beer
over
it
and
the
result
is
a
very
nice
foamy
head
this
is
the
way
to
drink
the
beer
o
this
beer
was
okay
pretty
average
good
tart
taste
though
its
an
ok
beer
not
a
good
drink
for
the
colder
months
but
would
be
money
as
a
hot
weather
session
beer
id
look
forward
to
one
of
these
after
doing
anything
to
work
up
a
sweat
easy
to
drink
wont
land
you
in
jail
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
bright
white
one
and
a
half
finger
head
which
quickly
dissipates
grass
and
flora
light
sour
citrus
notes
and
a
very
light
accent
of
funk
on
the
nose
green
tea
fresh
grassiness
slight
tart
light
lemon
and
bready
yeast
midpalate
that
finishes
dry
slightly
tart
and
refreshing
light
body
mild
carbonation
the
concept
behind
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
less
intense
berliner
weissstyle
beer
bells
is
successful
in
accomplishing
that
oarsman
ale
is
a
good
introduction
beer
however
it
may
seem
to
be
a
bit
lacking
to
those
fairly
familiar
with
the
style
and
other
sour
styles
o
i
guess
this
is
well
done
to
the
style
but
its
really
just
not
for
me
probably
a
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
some
people
sessionable
but
too
tart
to
really
be
all
that
sessionable
although
althoughi
am
liking
it
more
at
the
end
of
bottle
2
maybe
ill
be
a
rootin
tooting
booster
before
too
long
poured
this
12
oz
weissbier
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
cloudy
straw
color
and
produced
an
average
white
head
featured
average
retention
and
it
left
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
base
of
malted
wheat
lemon
rind
medium
in
body
this
brew
had
a
classic
malted
wheat
base
and
the
tart
flavor
of
lactic
acid
due
to
the
sour
mash
process
that
was
used
to
brew
this
beer
by
far
not
the
best
sour
beer
that
i
have
had
but
is
an
excellent
gateway
into
the
category
nice
session
beer
excellent
summer
beer
i
would
order
this
again
o
refreshing
no
notable
metallic
notes
here
pretty
basic
berliner
good
and
sour
wheat
beer
i
might
have
to
pick
this
up
again
very
bready
with
lemon
and
citrus
tones
but
with
an
excellent
mix
of
characteristics
that
lets
a
lot
of
things
show
through
and
lets
no
one
thing
hijack
the
ride
berliner
weisse
characteristics
abound
good
feel
very
easily
drinkable
i
could
actually
go
for
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
a
really
excellent
production
imo
pours
a
semi
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
very
slight
head
scent
is
grassy
and
grainy
with
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
light
refreshing
and
very
easy
sipping
with
its
grassy
earth
taste
overall
a
very
smooth
and
light
beer
i
was
really
shocked
by
how
light
tasting
this
was
from
being
a
bells
brew
great
for
summer
but
dont
expect
the
bold
bells
taste
youre
accustomed
to
overall
i
really
really
like
this
beer
for
what
it
is
i
would
love
this
in
cans
overall
another
excellent
beer
after
a
long
day
of
hiking
not
as
good
as
the
german
counterparts
i
have
had
but
certainly
a
beer
i
could
do
a
six
of
wish
the
smell
was
a
bit
stronger
here
oa
nice
easy
drinking
beer
not
as
tart
as
i
was
expecting
but
it
would
be
a
nice
intro
to
tart
brews
nice
body
thats
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
sweet
bright
citric
fruits
with
a
tarty
dried
fruit
aspect
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
very
nice
actually
with
the
right
amount
of
balance
between
sweetness
acidity
and
sourness
the
sourness
is
a
little
stronger
than
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
but
is
rounded
out
by
a
faint
creaminess
for
being
7
months
old
the
beer
held
up
quite
well
and
retains
amazing
qualities
that
a
berliner
weiss
should
have
now
to
find
a
fresh
one
very
good
brew
o
not
nearly
as
enjoyable
as
i
recall
from
my
first
sixer
around
a
year
back
but
hey
everyones
palette
progresses
i
will
not
be
revisiting
this
one
o
i
really
really
liked
this
beer
ive
not
had
significant
experience
with
the
berliner
weiss
but
reading
the
label
on
the
bottle
i
think
bells
hit
right
on
with
what
they
were
trying
to
do
im
very
much
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
soon
and
will
update
my
review
when
i
do
3
5
d
super
easy
to
drink
with
good
flavors
but
could
use
some
more
depth
and
complexity
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
shouldnt
be
overlooked
d
very
drinkable
nice
berliner
weissbier
with
really
nice
balance
and
some
good
acidic
tart
and
funky
flavors
not
an
amazing
beer
by
any
measure
but
give
it
a
chance
and
you
realize
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
with
the
zesty
tartness
to
keep
you
interested
works
well
in
the
summer
heat
too
this
isnt
some
bigtime
heavy
barrel
aged
super
rare
and
expensive
beer
its
a
mild
berliner
weisseish
that
delivers
what
youd
expect
it
to
deliver
very
refreshing
to
drink
one
of
these
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
more
quenching
than
a
cup
of
iced
tea
or
lemonade
a
good
beer
to
keep
stocked
for
the
hot
season
no
doubt
on
tap
at
bar
louies
in
ann
arbor
cloudy
yellow
pour
creamy
white
head
on
top
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
aroma
is
sour
lemons
yeast
tart
taste
like
sour
urine
a
bit
watered
down
unpleasant
finish
slightly
puckering
was
not
impressed
with
this
one
and
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
in
general
ill
stick
to
dfh
festina
instead
as
this
is
the
only
one
of
the
style
that
i
found
tolerable
12oz
bottle
i
picked
up
at
beverage
world
in
ft
oglethorpe
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
berliner
based
on
the
label
though
it
did
metion
sour
mash
technique
light
orange
color
hints
of
malt
and
tartness
flavor
was
refreshing
slightly
tart
but
had
a
hint
of
what
seemed
like
stale
malt
easy
to
down
but
i
might
need
a
fresher
sample
this
is
only
the
second
berliner
weissbier
ive
had
the
other
being
dogfish
head
festina
peche
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
but
i
dont
know
if
its
because
i
liked
the
flavor
or
because
i
knew
what
to
expect
if
memory
serves
i
think
that
the
dfh
offering
is
a
little
more
sour
than
this
one
ill
have
to
try
them
together
sometime
to
verify
unfortunately
those
two
might
be
the
only
beers
of
this
style
i
can
easily
get
its
a
shame
since
these
beers
are
incredibly
good
thirstquenchers
poured
into
a
wine
glass
it
has
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
oarsman
has
a
nose
of
lemon
pepper
and
wheat
sipping
on
this
and
i
taste
bread
yeast
spice
and
citrus
it
is
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
as
one
would
hope
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
with
nice
carbonation
some
dryness
in
the
finish
it
is
not
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
but
pretty
good
and
some
folks
have
easy
access
to
it
this
beer
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
rahter
lage
white
head
and
a
slight
haze
to
it
the
nose
has
some
floral
citrus
as
well
as
some
wheat
and
a
lager
feel
taste
of
the
beer
is
about
the
same
and
it
also
has
a
slight
sourness
to
it
the
beers
flavors
are
well
balanced
but
lack
strength
and
complexity
it
is
rather
easy
drinking
and
accessible
to
just
about
anybody
not
bad
but
quite
average
not
a
conventional
berliner
weiss
as
i
understand
them
this
one
pours
a
bit
darker
hazy
orange
honey
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
smells
a
touch
sour
like
just
a
tad
of
brettanomyces
in
there
but
i
dont
think
there
is
tart
lemony
notes
as
well
with
a
funky
ale
yeast
flavor
is
yeast
forward
with
a
really
cool
wheat
malt
profile
the
sourness
comes
from
the
yeast
i
think
very
citrusy
this
is
a
pretty
solid
summer
brew
lots
going
on
but
lighter
in
body
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
not
boring
at
all
my
only
disappointment
was
not
in
the
beer
at
all
but
in
the
fact
that
my
waitress
told
me
this
was
a
sour
beer
it
isnt
but
it
is
quite
good
for
what
it
is
still
never
had
a
bells
brew
i
didnt
adore
o
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
im
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
the
description
of
it
being
a
session
beer
i
think
the
sourness
would
get
a
little
overpowering
after
2
i
enjoy
sipping
on
just
one
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
grain
and
some
wheat
but
not
too
much
of
the
tartness
i
expected
that
changes
a
little
bit
in
the
flavor
i
get
a
lot
of
wheat
with
a
very
light
amount
of
tartness
and
some
grain
thin
watery
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
decent
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
the
extra
age
didnt
seem
to
hurt
this
bottle
at
all
easy
to
drink
o
its
a
very
refreshing
and
light
beer
nothing
impressive
or
anything
but
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
long
during
a
hot
summer
day
lightly
hazy
yellow
thin
head
with
a
film
of
retention
and
a
collar
nose
has
a
light
tartness
some
graininess
a
bit
crackery
and
doughy
perhaps
a
bit
of
lemon
citrus
but
this
is
quite
mild
not
a
ton
of
flavour
initially
but
opens
up
into
some
tart
lemon
and
wheat
and
pale
malts
again
crackery
and
light
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
there
too
flavour
disappears
almost
as
soon
as
it
came
not
much
else
too
this
light
and
refreshing
and
i
could
easily
put
back
many
of
these
on
a
hot
patio
o
good
but
there
are
better
berliners
note
for
myself
i
forgot
i
reviewed
this
one
already
had
it
out
of
a
bottle
and
my
review
notes
were
almost
identical
other
than
the
beer
was
much
more
clear
in
appearance
than
it
was
on
tap
o
not
my
favorite
beer
memorable
beer
because
of
the
fact
i
havent
had
one
like
it
yet
it
will
give
me
something
to
compare
to
may
buy
one
here
and
there
just
for
fun
d
im
a
huge
fan
of
berliner
weissbier
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
average
at
best
in
all
facets
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
lacks
the
refinement
nuance
and
character
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
d
nice
berliner
weiss
from
bells
super
sessionable
and
nice
to
have
an
easytofind
american
version
the
mouthfeel
is
light
as
youd
expect
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
its
meant
for
quaffing
and
it
does
the
trick
overall
this
is
an
average
at
best
berliner
wiesse
but
its
a
refreshing
beer
that
id
never
turn
down
this
would
be
a
superb
pairing
with
pizza
m
light
bodied
and
wonderfully
bubbly
o
this
beer
really
cleanses
your
palate
similar
to
what
you
would
expect
from
a
light
sorbet
between
courses
at
dinner
o
very
light
and
refreshing
quite
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
sessionable
it
has
an
almost
palate
cleansing
quality
like
a
sorbet
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
it
definitely
one
to
get
again
o
not
a
bad
example
of
a
hard
to
find
style
but
kind
of
meh
overall
id
place
the
oarsman
somewhere
between
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
a
berliner
weiss
light
and
refreshing
it
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
another
winner
from
bells
overall
a
very
good
beer
outside
of
my
comfort
zone
but
it
makes
me
curious
to
try
others
in
the
style
i
first
tried
this
about
a
year
ago
and
i
remember
it
being
more
flavorful
if
youre
looking
for
a
refreshing
lighter
craft
beer
go
with
oarsman
there
are
plenty
of
other
low
alcohol
beers
that
are
more
flavorful
if
youre
looking
for
a
great
session
beer
i
will
probably
try
it
again
in
hopes
that
we
got
a
bad
batch
but
man
this
was
the
first
bells
letdown
ive
had
o
bells
has
done
a
fine
job
with
this
beer
regardless
of
the
style
it
gets
me
more
excited
to
try
other
versions
of
the
style
seems
to
be
a
good
introductory
sour
for
nonsour
drinkers
because
its
light
on
the
sour
and
abv
but
big
on
flavor
it
poured
a
hazy
offwhite
light
yellow
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
plenety
of
sour
notes
with
each
sip
but
it
was
not
too
overwhelming
nice
use
of
hops
and
some
crisp
and
dry
malt
backbone
with
each
sip
this
is
nice
intro
to
the
style
i
must
admit
overall
it
is
a
very
clean

i

im
liking
the
fact
that
they
made
this
one
a

rounder
in
six
packs
i
dont

of
many
brewers

up

overall
an
interesting
beer
feels
somewhat
like
a
berliner
weisse
but
not
quite
as
flavorful
or
tart
would
definitely
be
a
nice
compliment
to
a
hot
summer
day
or
as
a
thirst
quencher
after
a
big
bike
ride
definitely
drinkable
but
may
not
be
the
first
thing
i
go
for
d
well
i
have
had
many
american
pale
wheats
lately
and
this
one
is
definitely
unique
upon
first
taste
of
this
beer
it
was
presented
as
a
berliner
weisse
i
can
see
why
but
this
beer
just
lacks
the
tartness
to
really
fit
into
that
style
as
a
pale
wheat
i
think
this
i
s
a
great
summer
brew
nice
and
crisp
im
not
sure
but
i
dont
think
this
is
a
pale
wheat
ale
however
if
it
is
then
a
score
of
average
is
incredibly
generous
oarsman
definitely
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
nothing
special
it
is
just
a
slightly
sour
incredibly
refreshing
beer
i
have
been
enjoying
this
beer
with
my
lunch
lately
and
i
do
not
feel
a
buzz
i
just
feel
refreshed
it
tastes
similar
to
a
macro
but
has
a
solid
finish
that
sold
me
it
goes
down
very
well
also
but
nonetheless
i
cannot
really
justify
buying
it
again
unless
the
price
drops
because
9
99
for
this
is
just
a
bit
much
overall
worth
trying
hrmmm
not
my
idea
of
a
good
beer
i
know
bells
is
going
for
a
palatable
light
ale
for
hot
summer
days
but
id
pass
on
this
one
and
have
a
budweiser
instead
honestly
drinkability
refreshing
and
tart
very
very
simple
but
certainly
quite
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
too
sour
for
me
to
repeatedly
drinkable
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
amount
of
sediment
that
was
easy
to
pull
up
off
the
bottle
a
crisp
white
head
with
a
wheat
heffe
smell
seemingly
subtle
on
the
malts
pow
a
citrus
taste
right
up
front
very
limey
lemon
feels
good
for
a
wheat
beer
with
so
much
citrus
flavor
not
too
much
tart
i
was
surprised
by
this
i
thought
it
would
taste
less
then
it
does
cheers
drinkability
this
is
definitely
an
all
day
kind
of
beer
really
with
no
weight
to
it
and
an
especially
small
abv
great
refreshing
flavors
that
dont
overwhelm
the
sense
and
still
provide
refreshment
this
beers
got
a
great
thing
going
for
it
it
is
interesting
but
like
many
american
pale
wheat
ales
it
leaves
something
to
be
desired
it
goes
down
like
water
a
delicious
low
alcohol
beer
for
drinking
on
the
deck
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
get
to
excited
about
just
a
very
mild
sour
pours
a
pale
murky
gold
with
about
two
fingers
of
white
head
i
smell
lemon
citrus
and
wheat
tastes
like
it
smells
some
lemon
slight
grass
and
a
nice
sour
finish
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
definitely
see
this
being
a
session
beer
for
me
especially
on
hot
summer
days
d
refreshing
summer
beer
not
as
tart
as
advertised
but
still
drinkable
not
sure
i
would
buy
again
but
would
drink
if
offered
at
a
bbq
drinkability
good
could
drink
these
all
day
especially
on
a
sunny
summer
day
like
today
very
pale
light
yellow
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
little
while
before
settling
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
not
sure
what
the
brewers
intent
was
here
brew
a
berliner
weiss
type
of
beer
or
a
boring
flavorless
wheat
beer
this
beer
definately
landed
on
the
boring
side
grainy
wheat
aroma
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
sour
lemon
if
it
wasnt
for
the
slight
sourness
in
this
beer
it
would
be
a
completely
pointless
thing
to
drink
but
it
still
is
barely
enough
to
get
me
to
continue
to
drink
this
beer
just
a
little
flavor
from
the
wheat
but
lacks
any
spice
or
fruity
esters
zero
bitterness
no
off
flavors
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
light
body
as
expected
and
pleasantly
carbonated
this
beer
needed
more
charactor
seems
like
it
was
a
lackluster
attempt
at
producing
a
berliner
weiss
or
gose
tart
and
tangy
with
lemon
and
wheat
bubbly
light
and
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
relatively
low
4
0abv
and
easy
drinkability
would
make
this
a
great
warm
weather
session
beer
this
beer
is
easier
to
gulp
than
sip
perhaps
would
get
better
ratings
if
under
a
different
style
category
d
no
thanks
ill
stick
with
two
hearted
man
this
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
struggled
with
the
one
bottle
i
had
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
retains
ok
aroma
has
some
tart
green
apple
notes
upfront
along
with
wheat
and
hay
egg
bread
dough
and
little
else
the
flavor
has
some
wheat
and
hay
notes
initially
as
well
as
granny
smith
apple
lime
juice
bread
dough
and
some
cracker
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
without
being
watery
and
drinkability
is
exceptional
this
isnt
a
particularly
complex
beer
but
it
does
what
it
does
very
well
and
could
be
a
perfect
summer
beer
very
refreshing
and
makes
a
perfect
summer
beer
i
am
however
disappointed
in
this
when
i
first
had
this
on
tap
in
march
it
was
more
tart
had
more
depth
and
body
and
was
an
overall
unique
and
awesome
beer
i
feel
like
now
its
a
good
berliner
weisse
which
its
not
even
listed
as
anymore
its
worth
trying
but
its
not
what
it
used
to
be
its
a
simple
sessionable
sour
ale
its
not
for
everyone
but
i
enjoyed
it
t
the
flavor
is
unique
and
refreshing
at
sip
1
i
am
not
sure
if
i
like
it
but
sip
5
it
is
working
well
still
it
leave
a
bit
of
a
sour
flavor
in
the
mouth
that
isnt
wholly
pleasant
not
a
fan
of
this
one
but
a
great
gateway
beer
for
some
i
suppose
a
pretty
pale
gold
color
that
has
smallish
fizzy
white
head
head
quickly
recedes
to
a
thin
ring
aroma
is
pretty
malty
actually
some
big
wheaty
notes
in
there
that
smell
authenticinteresting
nose
taste
is
pretty
good
has
a
lemony
tart
kick
midpalate
that
i
enjoy
wheaty
finish
clean
flavor
a
bit
of
corn
in
there
too
fizzy
in
the
mouth
though
smooth
finish
dryish
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
a
good
take
on
wheat
beer
but
still
not
a
style
i
am
particularly
fond
of
this
is
a
super
drinkable
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
its
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
edit
almost
a
year
later
i
had
another
six
pack
of
this
for
the
weekend
of
the
fourth
now
that
ive
had
some
other
beers
that
are
sour
i
understand
this
one
a
good
deal
more
and
enjoy
it
d
this
beer
is
a
light
crisp
easy
drinking
beer
but
a
bit
more
tartness
or
some
brett
character
or
something
would
have
made
it
much
more
drinkable
pretty
weak
effort
from
bells
in
my
opinion
i
love
many
of
their
beers
but
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
its
good
to
see
this
is
no
longer
listed
as
a
berliner
weisse
as
describing
the
beer
as
such
would
be
rather
misleading
d
this
seems
to
have
some
of
the
characteristics
that
it
should
with
the
style
being
a
berliner
weissamerican
pale
wheat
hybrid
but
i
found
it
not
pleasurable
to
drink
and
even
in
hot
weather
probably
not
anything
that
id
be
reaching
for
again
d
im
not
so
sure
about
this
one
it
is
very
refreshing
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
in
a
row
in
every
regard
this
beer
vaguely
resembles
a
berliner
weiss
but
the
end
result
is
a
mellow
pale
wheat
ale
with
sharp
amount
of
carbonation
and
mild
tart
zing
appearance
is
relatively
clear
and
pale
grassy
lemon
yellow
colored
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
maintains
a
consistent
thick
ring
of
bubbles
and
film
with
no
lacing
aroma
is
very
mild
and
unremarkable
blend
of
wheat
grass
and
are
those
peanuts
wtf
doesnt
really
smell
much
like
any
berliner
or
pale
wheat
ignoring
the
flavor
the
body
is
very
crisp
tart
and
refreshing
with
extremely
sharp
carbonation
the
flavor
is
exceptionally
wheaty
lemony
and
grassy
with
a
lingering
mild
tartness
i
ended
up
really
enjoying
this
even
though
i
was
disappointed
it
wasnt
a
more
traditional
berliner
as
others
have
mentioned
its
like
a
bizarre
oberon
lite
mixed
with
something
to
me
this
is
somewhere
between
an
american
pale
wheat
and
berliner
weiss
probably
why
it
has
flipped
classification
on
tap
at
the
thirsty

fest
pours
a
slight
hazy
golden

with
minimal
head
aroma
of
lemon
and
other
citrus
does
not
finish
well
finishes
with
an
off
bitter
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
not
a
good
representation
of
a
berliner
weisse
the
only
real
good
quality
was
the
mouthfeel
everything
else
falls
short
d
this
was
a
decent
beer
perfect
for
summer
sitting
on
the
porch
sipping
away
as
i
mentioned
the
blast
of
citrus
was
really
nice
served
from
growler
into
a
coast
imperial
pint
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
fruit
and
malt
with
a
skunk
aroma
upon
warming
up
the
flavor
was
of
subtle
fruit
and
malt
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
nice
brew
to
enjoy
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
was
refreshing
and
had
very
subtle
flavors
however
in
my
humble
opinion
i
think
the
aroma
and
flavor
was
lacking
a
little
complexity
for
me
still
nice
and
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
probably
wont
have
it
again
d
a
middlingtoshameful
effort
by
a
great
brewery
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
d
after
i
got
past
the
powdery
nose
and
boring
start
i
enjoyed
the
ale
a
nice
beach
beer
from
bells
i
love
bells
but
this
one
was
not
what
i
has
hoping
it
would
be
dreally
easy
drinking
and
a
great
summer
beer
i
wish
this
would
replace
oberon
as
their
summer
goto
beer
but
this
this
is
just
kinda
there
the
malt
is
weak
even
for
a
berliner
and
the
sour
overrides
it
but
the
sour
itself
isnt
especially
complex
or
interesting
you
got
some
light
nodes
of
raspberries
and
then
in
the
back
a
little
bit
of
citrus
hops
thats
it
its
neatit
really
is
kind
of
like
a
whole
new
wave
of
easy
drinking
sessionsbut
its
not
neat
enough
to
make
a
fuss
over
very
drinkable
with
the
low
abv
this
is
quite
a
session
beer
d
light
easy
drinking
and
crisp
its
great
for
a
hot
day
but
is
not
as
tart
as
i
was
hoping
enjoyable
brew
but
not
worth
going
crazy
over
i
would
drink
this
again
especially
in
this
brutal
sc
summer
beer
is
also
thin
bodied
and
mildly
lactic
i
got
scolded
by
the
rep
for
telling
people
it
was
a
berleinerweiss
he
told
me
some
incorrect
facts
about
how
this
beer
was
made
and
how
berleiners
were
made
and
then
instructed
me
to
tell
them
that
it
was
a
lemony
wheat
beer
i
got
some
lemons
in
the
taste
but
not
a
lot
it
is
about
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
come
across
this
is
definitely
not
my
first
choice
in
a
style
of
beer
however
the
oarsmen
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
they
are
spoton

the

this
was
definitely
a
worthwhile
growler
and
experience
i
could
drink
one
of
these
a
daywith
the
flavoring
nice
and
mild
great
dessert
or
break
between
different
styles
of
beers
to
clean
the
palette
served
up
a
hazy
murky
yellow
with
absolutely
no
head
the
aroma
was
tart
and
wheaty
with
some
fruity
notes
of
lemon
zest
and
some
pear
the
flavor
was
not
as
sour
as
the
other
examples
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
but
it
definitely
has
some
pucker
power
wheaty
lemony
grassy
and
slightly
astringent
not
a
whole
lot
of
depth
here
but
the
flavors
seem
well
proportioned
and
are
enjoyable
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
had
a
clean
light
finish
that
made
it
very
refreshing
pretty
drinkable
but
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
still
a
nice
beer
and
a
decent
take
on
a
hard
to
find
style
had
a
pint
with
brunch
at
the
sidecar
in
philly
this
turned
out
to
be
a
tasty
replacement
for
a
mimosa
and
made
a
nice
compliment
to
my
huevos
rancheros
the
beer
appeared
an
opaque
yellow
with
a
slice
of
lemon
the
beer
while
not
very
tasty
had
a
wonderful
mix
of
creamy
bread
with
toast
and
wheat
cracker
flavors
there
were
mild
hints
of
citrus
but
on
the
whole
it
was
a
bit
clean
for
the
style
still
a
very
tasty
beer
and
worth
checking
out
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
overall
not
as
sour
as
most
berliners
and
a
lot
more
wheat
beer
forward
was
happy
to
see
this
on
the
menu
at
mad
mex
today
you
dont
see
this
style
around
too
often
i
think
there
should
be
more
examples

overall
i
was

down
by
this

the

there

it

more

to
round
everything
out
not
one
to
avoid
but
not
one
to
seek
out
overall
a
rather
average
offering
from

i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
i
have
to
admit
d
nicely
done
berliner
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
if
they
were
available
in
bottles
love
seeing
a
lighter
sort
of
a
rare
style
done
this
nice
d
lite
in
taste
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
tartness
solid
but
not
great
d
extremely
drinkable
the
low
alcohol
content
light
body
and
citrusy
character
makes
this
one
easy
to
drink
mow
the
lawn
and
have
a
few
bells
oarsman
ontap
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
some
head
and
lace
a
bit
hazy
in
appearance
smell
is
vague
just
some
citrus
pulling
through
taste
follows
the
nose
with
some
lemon
rind
lemontea
like
hops
and
pale
malt
touch
of
wheat
is
also
there
uberrefreshing
and
went
great
with
some
wings
this
is
another
beer
that
begs
for
warmer
weather
to
be
enjoyed
fully
i
have
to
say
this
was
a
pleasing
beer
and
it
was
gone
too
fast
drinks
very
easy
a
pretty
accessible
but
a
semi
faithful
take
on
the
style
went
great
with
my
pizza
d
while
this
would
be
highly
drinkable
in
the
summer
i
would
always
choose
an
1809
first
d
pretty
drinkable
the
lack
of
tartness
may
actually
make
it
more
so
but
its
not
one
i
will
miss
the
flavor
is
slightly
tart
not
sour
at
all
but
a
good
flavor
of
oranges
hits
the
tongue
thicker
mouthfeel
than
most
berliner
weiss
ive
tried
moderate
carbonation
also
creates
a
decent
mouthfeel
for
how
exclusive
and
rare
this
is
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
overall
impression
this
is
the
second
berliner
weisse
ive
had
in
the
past
4
days
i
really
enjoyed
it
even
after
having
3
other
bells
beers
prior
to
this
it
was
not
quite
as
good
as
the
1809
i
had
a
few
days
back
but
it
was
pretty
dam
close
d
this
is
pretty
decent
overall
for
drinkability
i
dont
consider
it
the
best
berliner
i
have
had
it
is
kind
of
lactic
but
doesnt
hold
to
the
finish
light
cloudy
yellow
straw
color
fizzy
white
head
good
retention
yet
minimal
lacing
smell
is
of
hay
and
straw
wheat
and
white
bread
with
a
touch
of
lemon
taste
starts
a
with
a
slightly
tart
and
sour
lemon
profile
moving
on
to
the
straw
and
bread
components
noted
in
the
smell
the
finnish
has
a
little
yeasty
and
another
sour
kick
to
it
light
bodied
good
carbonation
recomended
to
drink
as
liquid
approached
room
temperature
to
get
more
of
the
interesting
flavors
very
light
tasting
when
cold
a
turbid
yellow
color
almost
the
color
of
wheat
not
too
much
of
a
smell
outside
of
a
bit
of
a
sour
note
very
refreshing
to
drink
dry
was
the
first
and
the
main
sensation
there
was
a
bit
of
a
citrusysour
flavor
but
not
so
much
as
other
flavored
berliner
weisses
i
have
had
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
low
abv
even
though
its
standard
for
this
style
was
appreciated
overall
not
overly
sour
just
smooth
and
well
done
overall
i
am
having
a
hard
time
understanding
that
this
is
a
bweissse
either
that
or
i
just
dont
know
the
style
well
enough
it
was
light
in
flavor
and
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
great
session
beer
d
this
is
a
very
nice
berliner
weiss
its
only
my
second
but
it
was
quite
delicious
i
would
drink
it
again
but
probably
not
run
out
and
specifically
look
for
it
i
could
drink
this
till
the
cows
come
home
low
alcohol
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
heres
to
hoping
some
bottling
goes
on
with
the
oarsman
dont
pass
this
up
its
good
its
real
good
my
first
experience
with
a
sour
wheat
quite
interesting
and
mind
opening
poured
a
cloudy
grassy
yellow
with
minimal
head
smell
is
tart
with
some
vinegar
like
aromas
very
citrusy
and
bitter
smelling
taste
is
mouth
puckering
with
the
finish
of
a
wheat
beer
quite
complex
like
sucking
on
a
lemon
and
then
eating
a
scoop
of
cereal
rushes
on
the
tongue
and
delivers
a
citrus
punch
that
puckers
the
tongue
and
opens
the
nasal
cavity
great
wheat
finish
to
slow
things
down
great
beer
but
considering
its
my
first
step
into
sours
i
dont
understand
the
drinkability
yet
very
crisp
and
refreshing
though
on
tap
at
stub
n
herbs
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
the
haze
probably
coming
from
the
wheat
no
head
and
no
lacing
which
is
expected
of
the
style
but
still
rather
dull
looking
smell
is
light
and
citrusy
really
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
aroma
but
a
light
sourness
can
be
detected
taste
is
sharp
crisp
and
lightly
tart
flavors
of
citrus
light
acidity
and
mild
sugary
sweetness
light
to
medium
bodied
fizzy
somewhat
refreshing
not
a
bad
berliner
weissbier
but
ive
had
much
better
note
according
to
this
site
it
was
only
brewed
once
i
hope
larry
bell
and
crew
decide
to
make
this
one
again
its
pretty
amazing
a
beer
this
light
and
tasty
is
very
drinkable
the
sourness
could
get
to
some
after
more
than
one
of
these
though
i
could
definitely
drink
another
and
i
did
drinkability
very
drinkable
nice
flavor
fast
clean
finish
with
a
little
sour
and
grain
easy
to
throw
back
it
isnt
always
on
tap
and
they
dont
sell
it
so
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
a
nice
crisp
beer
that
you
can
drink
all
night
the
beer
went
well
with
the
peanuts
this
was
decent
some
moderate
full
flavors
and
a
crisp
body
made
for
some
good
sessionalbility
with
this
plus
i
think
that
this
was
their
cheapest
offering
at
the
cafe
running
around
3
for
a
20
oz
pint
good
deal
d
very
drinkable
great
outdoor
summer
drink
overall
overwhelmingly
sour
without
the
flavor
to
back
it
up
o
for
my
first
taste
of
de
garde
this
was
pretty
disappointing
but
i
already
knew
this
is
considered
one
of
the
lesser
rated
ones
got
to
start
somewhere
right

on

has
a
good
level
of

with
a

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
the
blueberry
presence
in
this
one
is
fairly
subtle
the
palate
opens
with
a
big
fruity
flavor
bright
jammy
blueberries
mildly
tart
and
with
a
blend
of
skin
bitterness
and
seed
tannins
the
berliner

follows
with
a
very
yogurty

mildly
buttermilklike
flavor

with
a
blend

on

the
lingering

amazing
sourness
is

the
funk
i
picked
up
on

present
to
a

lending
a
touch
of
spice
to
complement
the
lactic
sourness
and
the
fruit
excellent
stuff
oregon
has
the
best
blueberries
ive
ever
had
and
this
beer
captures
their
essence
marvelously
head
and
shoulders
above
other
fruited
berliners
ive
had
recently
750
bottle
amuses
me
that
they
call
something
that
5

imperial
bright
yelloworange
almost
looks
like
it
could
be
apricot
purée
in
my
glass
intense
apricot
aroma
very
sour
taste
but
mixes
well
with
the
fruit
really
good
stuff
brightly
sour
with
great
but
not
overpowering
apricot
presence
the
amazing
de
garde
creation
of
the
imperial
bu
base
beer
shines
through
very
nicely
sublime
very
tart
which
i
like
yet
challenging
tons
of
sediment
not
an
improvement
over
the
nonimperial
version
spectacular
pure
apricot
nectar
most
apricot
forward
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
tmo
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
having
this
beer
a
few
times
in
the
past
along
with
a
bunch
of
other
bus
and
imperial
bus
and
this
is
one
of
my
favs
really
nice
apricot
with
a
hint
of
eggy
sourness
the
ultimate
in
refreshment
overall
there
is
a
lot
of
hype
around
degarde
but
for
good
reason
this
is
one
of
the
many
shining
examples
of
why
everyone
is
so
degarde
crazy
holy
crap
awesome
one
of
the
better
apricot
beers
i
have
had
cost
10
for
a
750
ml
bottle
the
nose
is
heavy
apricots
tart
tropical
fruit
a
little
chalk
and
candy
the
flavor
is
pretty
sour
puckering
dominated
by
apricots
other
tropical
fruit
a
little
grass
and
some
lemon
the
finish
is
clean
fresh
fruit
but
very
tart
and
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
alot
of
this
at
once
a
bit
intense
tartness
wise
first
had
this
at
de
garde
winter
release
an
was
not
impressed
was
an
older
bottle
release
today
i
had
this
on
tap
from
the
recent
release
and
wow
much
more
apricot
flavor
and
aroma
beautiful
beer
o
apricot
character
was
definitely
stamped
all
over
this
beer
youd
expect
this
to
be
top
notch
and
it
is
definitely
beats
out
the
foufoune
i
had
recently
on
tap
having
said
that
i
did
feel
that
it
lacked
wood
and
i
personally
would
have
like
a
little
more
residual
sweetness
owow
this
was
spot
on
if
it
was
a
tad
more
sour
the
beer
would
have
been
perfect
as
this
might
have
been
the
best
apricot
beer
ive
ever
had
pours
a
murky
whitishorange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly

fresh
apricot
and
apricot

aromas
taste
is
much
the

with
slightly
sour
apricot
fruit
and
apricot
nectar
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild

of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
very
tasty
but
has
a
slightly
better
apricot
presence
in
the
aroma
to
me
popping
the
cap
revealed
a
goopy
ring
of
what
was
presumably
apricot
residue
around
the
rim
of
the
bottle
mouth
pouring
yielded
an
orangecopper
color
murky
but
bright
with
pours
past
the
middle
of
the
bottle
giving
quite
a
large
amount
of
pulpy
apricot
floaties
a
fluffy
white
head
receded
to
a
small
ring
lacing
the
glass
nicely
in
the
nose
apricot
dominated
with
lesser
notes
of
oak
and
wildflowers
lightly
toasted
wheat
the
taste
was
no
joke
apricots
and
lots
of
them
more
pronounced
than
in
any
other
apricot
beer
ive
ever
tasted
a
mix
of
fresh
apricot
meat
and
candied
apricot
more
sugary
sweet
than
tartsour
secondary
flavors
of
fresh
oak
toasted
wheat
and
some
hay
funk
medium
body
juicy
mouthfeel
overall
amazing
i
would
foamdome
this
all
day
every
day
if
i
could
overall
this
beer
is
fairly
sour
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
distracting
this
really
reminds
me
of
an
adult
lemonade
perfect
for
quenching
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
the
kiwi
gives
the
base
berliner
an
added
level
of
complexity
and
really
improves
the
overall
flavor
of
the
beer
the
aroma
on
this
is
interesting
but
ultimately
slightly
off
putting
still
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
milky
clouded
pale
yellow
with
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
white
head
lemony
nose
slightly
sour
and
yogurt
with
some
light
tropical
notes
fairly
sour

some
kiwi
fruit
green
and
lemony
wheat
and
light
yeast
medium
thick
highly
carbonated
body
with
a
puckering
milky
finish
overall
smells
pretty
bad
but
the
kiwi
sourness
is
nice
simple
beer
the
beer
is
a
simple
and
well
crafted
one
two
punch
of
kiwi
fruit
and
tart
berliner
o
solid
not
mindblowing
but
actually
a
pretty
good
expression
of
what
i
imagine
kiwi
in
a
sour
beer
to
be
better
than
upland
kiwi

sure

de
garde
has
been
hitting
home
runs
with
their
bu
program
and
this
is
a
grand
slam
verdict
a
delicious
berliner
from
de
garde
one
of
the
truer
and
jammier
fruit
expressions
ive
tried
from
them
the
balance
is
nice
though
quite
sour
and
with
a
more
aggressive
texture
but
the
bright
flavors
and
supremely
refreshing
nature
of
this
make
it
another
winner
o
very
nice
berliner
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
this
again
one
of
my
favourite
bus
from
de

this
beer
was
awesome
easily
put
down
the
750ml
myself
i
cant
wait
to
see
the
other
fruited

from

pour
is
dark
pink
with
an

light

lots
of

tight

nose
is
big

bright

with
tons
of

raspberry
the
raspberry
are
very
pithy
seems
very
sour
and
tart
flavor
is
a
bit
less
seedy
more
cherry
with
a
balanced
raspberry
a
lot
less
tart
than
i
would
have
thought
but
still
has
a

of

moderate

very
dry
light

bottle
by
special
delivery
by
a

who
visited
oregon
this
beer
smells
great
think
smucker
cherry
pancake
syrup
and
the
cherrry
aroma
is
intense
on
the
palate
i
get
the
expected
cherry
sour
component
with
some
underlying
vanilla
as
well
the
is
very
light
on
its
feet
but
you
would
expect
that
given
the
abv
pours
a
bright
pinkishpurple
with
white
head
and
some
clarity
such
a
nice
appearance
from
the
fruit
the
nose
is
predominantly
fresh
picked
raspberry
paired
with
lactobacillus
the
cherry
doesnt
seem
to
make
much
noise
here
perhaps
it
adds
to
the
acidic
undercurrent
the
flavor
is
straight
raspberry
and
lacto
tartness
juicy
fruits
up
front
nice
puckering
tartness
to
follow
a
touch
of
grainy
wheat
on
the
finish
the
barrel
isnt
detectable
on
my
palate
but
that
does
not
detract
from
how
tasty
this
beer
is
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
light
overall
a
delicious
fruited
berliner
one
of
the
best
bus
so
far
so
much
fruit
overall
a
fantastic
stone
fruited
light
sour
for
me
a
perfect
balance
of
juicy
fruit
and
sourness
not
the
most
complex
but
that
is
consistent
with
the
style
far
too
sour
for
a
berliner
weiss
berliners
should
be
tart
not
palatedestroyingly
sour
o
my
new
favourite
beer
from
de
garde
everything
that
apricot
bu
was
but
even
more
delicious
hands
down
the
best
apricot
sour
we
had
at
our
intensive
tasting
of
the
style
a
fellow
beard
shared
this
with
me
and
the
rest
of
the
house
after
i
did
the
same
with
a
different
bottle
at
the
de
garde
tasting
room
the
apricot
seemed
to
be
there
a
bit
more
than
the
peach
but
both
were
so
there
stellar
stuff
the
best
of
the
day
which
is
saying
a
lot
we
also
joked
that
a
beardless
man
has
probably
never
stepped
in
the
place
virtually
true
im
sure
d
cheers
the
palate
opens
with
a
pleasant
fruity
tartness
and
flavor
glorious
in
how
bright
it
is
focused
heavily
on
the
apricot
it
approaches
foufoune
in
intensity
semiripe
peach
character
is
present
on
the
midpalate
with
a
mild
peachy
vanilla
like
character
yogurt
and
buttermilk
are
present
towards
the
finish
the
palate
is
just
a
shade
green
but
thats
driven
by
how
driven
it
is
by
the
apricot
flavors
i
occasionally
get
a
mild
sulfury
note
from
stone
fruit
especially
if
i
eat
too
much
too
soon
and
this
beer
has
those
characteristics
light
in
body
crisply
but
not
overly
so
carbonated
this
beer
is
a
treat
on
the
palate
highly
recommended
given
my
love
for
apricots
i
think
i
just
might
prefer
this
over
the
also
excellent
berry
bu
that
preceded
it
much
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
easy
drinking
summer
shandy
nice
fresh
fruit
flavor
overall
straight
up
beer
mimosa
this
beer
is
world
class
nice
but
subtle
stone
fruit
a
bit
acetic
bitter
pit
flavor
on
the
finish
overall
mixed
some
great
points
but
some
not
so
great
very
little
berlinerweiss
flavours
but
great
fruit
serving
type
bottle
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
i
get
a
lot
of
tropical
fruit
up
front
on
the
palate
mostly
peach
i
would
say
but
the
beer
dries
out
quickly
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
lightly
sour
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
appreciated
the
dialed
down
sour
and
easy
drinkability
very
nice
beeer
verdict
a
very
nice
berliner
weissbier
from
de
garde
easy
to
see
how
it
serves
as
a
great
base
for
all
the
fruited
variants
on
its
own
though
its
refreshing
and
simple
very
crushable
would
make
for
a
great
summer
stand
by
smells
like
canned
corn
and
beets
faded
as
it
warmed
not
much
carbonation
and
the
flavor
is
mealy
and
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
meh
pass
starts
lemon
and
other
citrus
flavors
little
bit
of
citrus
though
nice
tartness
however
it
is
very
light
and
watery
the
body
was
light
and
crisp
with
a
finish
drier
than
the
sahara
desert
drinkability
was
so
excellent
i
didnt
even
mind
the
usually
despise
22oz
format
bottle
overall
a
great
beer
a
must
try
ive
only
recently
learned
about
de
garde
which
is
apparently
only
an
hour
south
from
where
i
live
and
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
make
it
down
yet
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
walked
into
hondos
and
found
this
in
the
cooler
this
is
a
really
well
priced
beer
at
least
here
in
portland
but
its
sadly
not
a
real
standout
to
me
especially
considering
the
ratings
that
im
seeing
up
here
lemons
lemons
lemons
lemons
everywhere
very
nice
lemon
flavor
and
crisp
acidity
very
easy
drinking
and
light
on
the
palate
1st
de
garde
beer
and
would
def
look
for
again
overall
this
is
a
good
sour
beer
it
is
surprisingly
refreshing
for
how
sour
it
is
like
it
bottle
that
froze
during
shipping
and
the
cap
popped
a
little
because
beer
was
frozen
only
lost
about
a
third
a
bit
flat
but
i
can
taste
the
promise
as
good
as
the
nose
is
the
palate
is
a
whole
different
beast
this
is
thoroughly
unconventional
lacking
in
the
clean
bready
lactic
sourness
of
the
traditional
berlinerweisses
and
in
its
stead
it
has
a
potent
and
inspired
juicy
fruit
tartness
with
a
blend
of
preserved
lemons
pineapple
heavily
soured
yogurt
if
youve
had
yogurt
in
a
tropical
country
in
the
summer
you
know
what
i
mean
moderate
funk
a
little
bit
of
earth
and
mushroom
are
present
along
with
a
hint
of
bread
the
midpalate
continues
the
exploration
of
fruit
as
an
expression
in
a
berlinerweiss
with
semiripe
white
grapes
a
blend
of
sourness
stone
fruit
and
some
citrus
light
in
body
moderately
carbonated
this
beer
has
a
long
tart
finish
moderately
yogurty
and
mostly
fruity
while
this
beer
is
not
a
pure
berlinerweiss
it
is
an
inspired
and
an
enjoyable
beer
highly
recommended
not
the
best
berliner
five
wow
for
the
abv
there
is
tons
of
flavor
the
tartness
is
unmistakeable
just
plain
bu
is
awesome
and
crushable
really
has
a
nice
lemon
acidic
thing
going
on
up
front
then
finishes
with
a
good
depth
of
flavor
and
crispy
sourness
a
bit
more
sour
than
most
other
of
the
style
but
also
much
cleaner
without
that
grainy
soggy
wheat
flavor
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
to
moderate
amount
of
fizzy
feel
and
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
berliner
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
my
only
gripe
is
that
my
idealistic
berliner
is
one
that
i
could
crush
glass
after
glass
of
in
the
summertime
this
one
has
some
serious
bite
to
it
and
while
sour
heads
might
rejoice
i
am
left
wishing
the
second
pour
didnt
feel
so
much
like
a
chore
you
have
to
be
a
real
fan
of
sour
and
farmhouse
ales
to
like
this
one
if
those
are
up
your
alley
this
is
a
really
good
beer
almost
kambuchaesque
the
way
it
smells
like
vinegar
but
tastes
sour
and
fruity
very
unique
and
different
this
brewery
came
out
of
nowhere
and
i
have
enjoyed
everything
they
make
not
a
beer
for
the
masses
though
o
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
especially
if
its
dialed
in
a
little
bit
so
that
the
taste
becomes
cleaner
still
at
2
1
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
here
couple
of
thoughts
about
this
beer
im
not
a
big
sour
fan
so
maybe
thats
part
of
the
problem
but
i
really
felt
the
sour
component
in
this
beer
was
completely
over
the
top
im
assuming
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
lactic
acid
in
this
beer
as
it
struck
me
as
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
give
me
an
upset
stomach
pretty
quickly
were
i
to
try
to
drink
a
bunch
of
it
the
bartender
indicated
he
liked
the
beer
quite
a
bit
but
admitted
it
was
hard
to
imagine
drinking
very
much
of
this
he
agreed
that
drinking
a
lot
of
this
would
probably
give
a
lot
of
people
a
stomach
ache
de
garde
seems
to
be
well
thought
of
so
ill
definitely
give
some
of
their
other
beers
a
try
but
imho
this
was
not
an
exceptionally
impressive
effort
on
their
part
overall
rough
acidity
unpleasant
good
fruitiness
though
o
very
imperessed
i
would
like
morwe
of
this
first
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
cant
wait
to
see
what
they
do
next
overall
at
2ishthe
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
all
night
and
all
day
and
you
get
the
point
besides
the
color
really
a
deliteful
beer
i
look
forward
to
try
more
from
de
garde
drinkability
is
high
if
you
like
it
super
tart
which
i
do
nice
to
see
such
a
big
flavor
low
alcohol
session
ale
basically
the
definition
of
drinkability
my
second
12oz
of
this
particular
beer
and
one
of
my
overall
favorites
so
refreshing
low
alcohol
content
but
delicious
taste
if
you
like
tart
smell
is
pleasing
but
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
too
bubbly
for
my
preference
what
an
excellent
berliner
this
is
wonderful
stuff
this
beer
has
a
nice
fruity
tartness
and
does
seem
a
bit
simplistic
in
my
description
but
it
is
a
great
summer
beer
that
is
very
quaftable
it
has
enough
interesting
character
to
make
it
worth
a
session
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
good
finger
foamy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
very
thin
layering
after
awhile
with
lots
of
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
sediment
is
seen
around
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
some
light
streaking
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
but
not
a
bunch
the
aroma
is
of
tart
citrus
zest
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
is
it
is
slightly
sour
but
good
as
this
is
the
style
of
brew
this
is
totally
different
type
of
brew
but
good
actually
no
bitter
or
hoppy
aftertaste
just
makes
you
puckerup
some
lighter
bodied
with
high
carbonation
but
seems
to
work
for
this
one
overall
kinda
like
this
one
overall
i
would
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
in
the
summer
months
i
got
this
as
an
extra
from
a
very
solid
trader
and
i
do
appreciate
this
cheers
man
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
very
nicely
done
and
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
try
it
out
not
bad
for
a
sour
type
bottle
as
a
nice
trade
extra
thanks
pours
light
yellow
mostly
clear
with
a
giant
fluffy
bubbly
head
on
too
that
recedes
quickly
aroma
is
lots
of
vinegar
lemon
peel
wheat
malts
dry
funky
tartness
flavor
is
lightly
tart
wheat
malt
some
hay
dry
funk
and
a
bit
of
a
dirty
finish
something
that
always
happens
for
me
with
the
style
very
light
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
overall
pretty
standard
berliner
going
on
here
plenty
drinkable
but
there
seems
to
be
something
missing
from
this
and
i
dont
know
what
lemon
heads
its
quite
flavorful
o
a
satisfying
beer
good
for
a
chicken
dinner
or
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
a
stick
to
your
ribs
beer
but
very
thirst
quenching
the
nose
is
lactic
acid
citrus
lemon
yeast
berry
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
tart
citrus
lemon
a
little
salt
white
pepper
it
isnt
mouth
puckering
more
like
noticeably
tart
this
is
pretty
simple
clean
easy
to
drink
almost
zero
alcohol
present
pretty
good
overall
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
sour
would
not
recommend
for
those
looking
for
a
very
tart
beer
but
if
you
are
just
getting
into
sours
this
is
one
to
try
as
it
has
the
beginnings
of
a
sour
parings
mcrib
overall
this
is
a
really
mellow
berlinner
and
i
really
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
i
would
crush
a
ton
of
this
beer
during
the
summer
time
so
many
layers
of
flavors
for
such
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
off
colors
best
beer
that
is
available
in
4
packs
i
hope
to
revisit
this
beer
many
many
times
in
the
future
conclusion
very
tasty
representation
of
this
classic
style
my
first
beer
from
off
color
and
the
first
i
have
seen
of
them
in
colorado
bottle
from
maltitude
pours
hazy
gold
aroma
of
funk
and
wheat
taste
of
bread
and
funk
very
lippuckering
sour
sour
aftertaste
not
too
shabby
serving
type
bottle
good
god
this
is
amazing
an
excellent
example
of
a
berliner
fiercely
tart
yet
robustly
malty
easily
in
my
top
3
examples
of
the
style
this
didnt
really
strike
me
as
a
particularly
sour
berliner
weisse
but
it
was
still
very
tasty
its
becoming
too
easy
and
too
widely
known
how
to
whip
up
a
quick
berliner
its
not
as
special
as
it
used
to
be
and
there
are
lot
of
real
average
or
even
poor
ones
being
acclaimed
by
people
who
are
just
thirsty
for
a
sour
beer
so
its
nice
to
have
a
more
careful
one
here
super
light
maybe
the
lightest
example
of
the
style
i
have
seen
looks
like
milky
wheat
beer
fizzy
white
but
cant
hold
a
head
a
fruity
nose
thats
tart
but
short
of
sour
white
wine
aromatics
puckerly
lemon
flavor
with
a
fruity
middle
and
a
body
thinner
than
water
carbonation
is
high
and
that
helps
a
lot
i
like
that
its
as
simple
as
it
is
not
trying
to
overdo
it
the
esters
are
there
and
the
lacto
mash
or
kettle
sour
aspect
is
there
sweaty
and
meaty
but
the
fruitiness
balances
it
all
out
i
still
think
the
apex
is
the
best
beer
from
off
color
that
i
have
had
but
this
is
a
solid
berliner
just
hate
paying
per
bottle
prices
like
this
for
a
beer
that
should
be
in
an
affordable
twelve
pack
of
cans
lemon
lactic
and
acetic
acid
dominate
the
aroma
accompanied
by
grain
and
light
floral
notes
flavor
reveals
a
light
clean
base
of
crackery
pilsner
malt
along
with
a
touch
of
wheat
in
the
finish
lactic
acid
lies
beneath
in
an
interesting
way
it
hits
upfront
and
dissipates
as
soon
as
the
mouth
is
opened
but
it
can
linger
as
long
as
the
mouth
is
closed
notes
of
lemon
and
acetic
acid
surface
in
the
aftertaste
excellent
beer
great
restraint
in
the
sour
character
as
compared
to
most
released
these
days
but
still
a
flavor
punch
bottle
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
well
built
head
thicker
and
white
random
lacing
smells
of
lacto
tartness
sour
lemons
wheat
good
aromatic
intensity
flavor
starts
off
with
initial
tartness
its
pretty
tart
but
there
is
a
level
of
balance
with
the
other
flavors
whet
and
grains
after
the
tartness
has
a
cider
element
to
it
one
of
the
more
drinkable
takes
on
the
style
the
sourness
isnt
parching
like
other
berliners
a
good
amount
of
body
for
such
a
minimal
beer
ive
been
working
this
one
over
pretty
good
over
the
last
couple
months
a
great
summer
drinker
hell
one
ill
probably
drink
well
into
the
fall
as
long
as
its
around
o
well
done
napoleonicera
berliner
weisse
solid
bb
amazing
on
hot
summer
days
reminds
me
a
lot
of
1809
berliner
but
with
more
spice
and
less
general
flavor
overall
wellmade
i
always
have
trouble
reviewing
base
berliners
because
they
just
cant
be
that
interesting
but
they
can
still
be
very
good
off
color
brewing
fierce
45
off
color
tends
to
lean
toward
styles
rarely
seen
on
the
shelves
and
they
also
seem
to
nail
each
and
every
one
the
wheat
is
substantial
as
it
should
be
with
a
bright
lemon
acidity
thats
makes
the
drinkability
ridiculous
honestly
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
buy
you
some
verdict
a
very
nice
berliner
weissbier
from
off
color
it
has
a
nice
delicate
feel
and
a
gentle
softness
that
is
very
enjoyable
definitely
a
nice
refresher
of
a
beer
that
arrived
just
in
time
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
for
someone
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
such
as
myself
on
a
hot
humid
summer
daysuch
as
today
its
perfect
it
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
more
of
these
laying
around
my
fridge
however
its
a
bit
pricey
at
8
99
tax
for
four
12
oz
bottles
i
am
aware
the
style
generally
boast
a
lower
abv
but
i
mean
come
on
i
spend
that
kinda
money
i
want
to
at
least
get
near
a
proper
buzz
and
the
thing
while
quite
tasty
doesnt
immediately
signal
beer
to
me
im
a
heavyweight
not
no
featherweight
thats

bready

a

its
dry

leads
to
a

aftertaste
leaving
behind
a
bright

taste
thats
beautifully
sour
and
brilliantly
clean
echoes
of

long
after

really
well

berliner
that
is

this

it

it
is
also
higher
in

aftertaste
that
reminds
of
sucking

a

throughout

a
bit
of

a

rough
on
the
palate
intergalactic
acid
may
not
be
one
of
the
more
intense
berliner
weissstyle
beers
on
the
market
but
it
was
tasty
and
quite
refreshing
nevertheless
available
for
under
4
a
bottle
i
can
definitely
see
this
becoming
a
summer
staple
thumbs
up
oi
havent
run
into
a
berliner
with
more
flavor
intergalactic
acid
is
impressive
in
its
pungency
at
such
a
low
level
of
alcohol
i
may
not
have
loved
the
flavor
but
that
is
just
personal
preference
i
can
see
people
becoming
absolutely
smitten
with
this
one
overall
not
bad
nice
sourness
tart
lemon
and
fruit
lactic
acid
crackery

very
refreshing
pour

with
a
deep

some

hints

but
a
huge
sulfur
flavor
takes
over
and
lingers
through
the
finish
body
is
a
bit
fuller
than
id
presser
with
strong
carbonation
and
a
puckering
finish
milky
yellow
with
a
brown
tint
in
color
when
poured
opaque
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
i
did
not
find
the
appearance
appealing
in
my
opinion
the
smell
however
was
very
appealing
sweet
citrus
scent
with
lemon
being
prominent
tart
and
somewhat
wheaty
the
taste
matched
up
well
with
the
aroma
tart
lemony
wheat
and
smooth
very
refreshing
at
the
end
of
a
warm
spring
day
light
to
medium
body
with
nice
light
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
great
summer
beer
as
it
has
a
refreshing
quality
it
will
be
picking
up
some
more
for
sure
overall
this
is
terrific
its
a
great
sour
and
session
beer
im
happy
the
tap
brewing
is
2
blocks
from
me
ill
be
going
to
get
this
on
draft
and
more
bottles
it
will
be
great
by
the
pool
all
day
cant
wait
for
that
the
beer
pours
a
milky
pale
yellow
with
a
small
sized
head
of
eggshell
white
bubbles
in
body
the
beer
is
cloudy
and
opaque
leaving
nothing
of
the
other
side
of
the
glass
to
be
seen
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
soggy
wheat
flakes
light
lemons
thick
yogurt
and
a
pool
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
of
a
middling
tart
bight
and
then
a
bready
sweet
finish
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
tart
lemon
moving
into
lemon
yogurt
then
chlorine
and
then
a
nice
bready
finish
of
wheat
flakes
and
very
soft
lemon
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
in
body
with
a
strong
carbonation
yet
a
slightly
smooth
yet
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
berliner
weisse
with
some
good
wheat
malt
and
yogurt
flavors
its
neither
the
tartest
nor
the
tamest
but
the
chlorine
flavors
do
effect
the
experience
a
little
i
like
the
yogurt
flavor
but
i
like
this
one
more
mit
schuss
a
decent
berliner

cheers
o
a
well
crafted
and
true
to
form
berliner

glad
i
have
a
bomber
of
it
light
crisp
and
refreshing
for
the
stellar
price
of
4
50
a
bottle
ill
likely
pick
up
a
few
more
to
help
combat
the
heat
wave
this
is
a
stellar
berliner
weiss
its
tart
funky
crisp
refreshing
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
someone
tried
to
brew
vegetable
broth
and
the
bottle
was
only
5
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
charming
concoction
overall
it
is
memorable
and
a
day
later
i
am
still
trying
to
decide
if
i
like
it
enough
to
get
it
again
very
interesting
beer
but
i
have
had
way
better
in
the
style
on
the
positive
this
is
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
seen
really
nice
job
with
the
presentation
o
425
i
really
dig
berliners
and
this
is
an
excellent
one
perfect
for
summer
would
really
like
to
try
this
with
some
woodruff
pours
a
pale
hazy
gold
with
a
white
head
smells
like
green
apples
lemon
zest
and
hay
taste
is
funky
and
tart
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
refreshing
fairly
crisp
although
slightly
undercardbed
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
those
hot

days

overall
a
great
quencher
for
hot
houston
summers
very
glad
to
find
more
breweries
moving
towards
lower
alcohol
with
full
flavors
o
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
i
crushed
the
22oz
before
realizing
it
wish
this
had
more
carbonation
but
that
is
a
minor
gripe
slightly
cloudy
straw
colored
pour
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
light
yeast
and
lemon
initial
taste
has
a
really
nice
sour
edge
with
a
bit
of
lemon
very
light
bodied
with
a
bit
of
grain
coming
out
towards
the
end
finishes
crisp
and
sour
to
the
point
of
almost
being
more
of
a
sour
nice
stab
at
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
there
was
only
one
of
these
in
the
fridge
at
the
local
grocery
store
and
the
label
was
partly
ripped
off
so
i
kinda
bought
it
blind
but
st
arnold
always
does
a
good
job
and
im
certainly
not
disappointed
even
tho
that
first
blast
of
sour
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
good
job
again
tho
st
arnold
a
cool
little
berliner
right
here
very
delicate
lightly
flavored
and
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
saint
arnold
beers
ive
had
recently
its
real
pale
in
color
white
laced
straw
color
some
yeasty
haze
and
a
nose
of
light
lemon
lacto
and
plain
wheat
malt
rather
simple
but
thats
what
i
want
in
hot
weather
something
to
just
open
up
and
drink
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
those
i
wish
it
hard
a
little
more
sourness
to
it
more
acidity
and
tartness
especially
to
tidy
up
the
finish
and
add
that
refreshment
factor
but
the
body
is
super
minimal
and
the
carbonation
is
there
so
it
still
drinks
real
easy
but
its
not
quite
as
quenching
as
others
quick
finish
with
a
lemon
taste
to
it
like
a
wedge
in
a
wheat
beer
the
lacto
character
isnt
very
developed
a
more
approachable
berliner
than
many
good
for
those
who
are
unsure
if
they
like
these
sorts
of
beers
i
have
no
idea
what
a
bottle
costs
because
this
was
shared
with
me
but
if
it
was
5
or
6
bucks
a
bottle
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
all
summer
long
any
more
than
that
and
you
have
better
options
out
there
pours
yellowgolden
colored

quickly
dissipates

on
the
end
crisp
fruity
taste
highly
carbonated
strong
funky
taste
on
the
end
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
type
of
beer
it
is
very
light
and
refreshing
i
am
impressed
so
far
i
poured
this
into
a
standard
pint
glass
its
a
crystalclear
pale
gold
color
with
a
slight
head
the
nose
is
a
grainy
malt
slightly
sweet
flavor
does
offer
appropriate
lactic
sourness
but
not
much
else
its
all
grainy
sourness
and
not
very
interesting
solid
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
will
revisit
it
much
overall
a
solid
offering
from
saint
arnold
and
im
glad
we
have
a
cheap
locally
available
berliner
this
could
probably
benefit
from
some
fruit
syrup
though
modest
tartness
leads
into
a
grainy
almost
lagerfeeling
middle
and
is
followed
by
a
cruising
sour
finish
its
light
mouthfeel
helps
accentuate
the
mild
sourness
from
the
lacto
its
not
going
to
blow
away
anyone
looking
for
a
sour
fix
but
it
is
pretty
true
to
the
style
and
is
very
refreshing
i
could
take
down
a
bottle
of
this
with
much
rapidity
im
glad
saint
arnold
made
this
and
look
forward
to
crushing
more
of
these
over
the
summer
onice
bw
easy
drinking

but
overall
perfectly

crackerlike

bright

clean

seriously
the
cleanest
beer
that
st
arnold
could
ever
hope
to
produce
mouthfeel
has
a
surprising
weight
of
body
considering
the
3

imimpressed
this
is
not
the
best
berliner
weisse
but
certainly
my
favorite
st
arnold
beer
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
theirs
i
want
to
drink
this
all
the
damned
time
id
be
curious
to
have
this
mit
schuss
o
a
great
shot
at
an
excellent
beer
style
although
the
recipe
could
do
with
some
tweaking
here
and
there
it
still
makes
for
a
great
sessionable
wheat
beer
and
probably
even
better
for
a
year
round
offering
overall
cant
believe
ill
be
able
to
have
this
yearround
this
will
probably
be
in
my
fridge
this
summer
as
much
as
hg
zoe
which
says
a
lot
great
beer
st
arnold
overall
this
is
my
first
berliner
weisse
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
against
however
judging
from
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
i
plan
to
seek
out
this
style
specifically
i
really
really
dig
this
beer
will
be
a
great
edition
to
the
texas
hot
summers
its
nice
to
finally
have
really
available
berliner
in
houston
even
if
i
was
limited
to
only
two
bottles
at
a
certain
store
in
downtown
first
impressions
are
indeed
good
if
available
i
will
always
be
grabbing
a
ton
of
bottles
this
will
be
perfect
for
the
summer
but
also
enough
character
that
i
can
enjoy
anytime
if
all
you
want
is
a
sourness
and
acidity
to
dominate
this
is
not
for
you
otherwise
grab
this
by
the
case
fairly
hazy
very
pale
yellow
practically
white
in
color
forms
a
fizzy
white
head
that
slowly
reduces
to
a
creamy
surface
coating
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
standard
for
the
style
slightly
tart
wheat
and
a
light
bit
of
lemon
taste
is
also
pretty
much
on
the
mark
for
a
berliner
mostly
wheat
with
a
slight
lemony
tartness
lighter
bodied
heavier
carbonation
good
stuff
the
taste
really
is
great
with
tangy
yet
not
extremely
tart
flavors
with
subtle
lemony
tinge
and
nice
foundation
of
wheat
malt
for
a
lactic
acidity
which
brings
you
back
with
light
sweet
cereral
flavor
and
honeylemon
quality
overall
a
pretty
great
canned
berliner
probably
the
only
i
have
had
i
would
drink
this
anytime
it
is
sour
enough
to
be
truly
drinkable
without
crossing
the
trheshold
of
to
tart
the
epitome
of
what
the
style
should
be
thanks
again
for
the
share
adam
not
a
pretty
beer
but
a
sensational
summer
drink
i
am
not
sure
the
conventional
rating
system
is
fair
to
this
beer
is
it
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
of
course
not
but
as
a
purpose
built
lawn
mower
beer
outta
this
world
i
did
a
berliner
weiss
beer
bakeoff
betwee
this
and
ng
bw
and
this
was
narrowly
the
winner
i
had
2
cans
now
they
are
gone
and
its
getting
hot
that
makes
me
sad
more
berliner
weiss
across
the
board
please
nebco
are
my
heros
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
berliner
i
could
see
heaving
these
cans
at
targets
floating
down
the
apple
river
fifteen
years
ago
ok
twenty
well
made
beer
for
the
cheery
days
of
summer
not
that
minnesota
is
likely
to
see
that
anytime
soon
extremely
drinkable
really
really
enjoyed
this
one
even
at
below
freezing
temperatures
thanks
a
bunch
woosterbill
o
this
was
a
nice
simple
standard
berliner
weiss
id
love
to
see
nebco
put
some
fruit
in
this
at
some
point
it
might
also
be
interesting
to
try
again
with
some
fruited
syrup
added
overall
its
nothing
that
i
would
go
crazy
for
but
if
you
are
into
the
style
then
and
dont
mind
a
little
acidity
it
is
definitely
worth
the
try
the
crack
revealed
yet
another
brimful
craft
can
and
the
inverted
glug
released
a
sour
cheesy
odor
into
the
air
i
had
a
brief
finger
of
bonewhite
head
that
fizzed
its
way
out
of
existence
very
quickly
almost
like
pop
color
was
a
cloudy
lightyellow
srm

and
the
serving
wench
in
her
drindl
wanted
to
know
mit
schuss
nein
cheers
who
knew
you
could
get
such
a
good
berliner
weiss
in
a
can
o
pretty
nice
overall
a
little
doughy
for
my
liking
but
pretty
nice
overall
put
this
right
around
weisse
weisse
baby
for
american
berliners
another
seriously
good
berliner
weisse
im
glad
to
see
this
style
exploding
recently
lots
of
beautiful
sour
and
fruity
flavors
with
ridiculously
low
levels
of
alcohol
perfect
combination
if
you
ask
me
i
quite
enjoyed
nebcos
take
on
the
style
i
wish
this
was
available
to
me
id
have
a
case
of
it
stocked
in
the
fridge
for
the
remainder
of
the
summertime
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
berliner
weiss
and
it
comes
in
a
can
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
clean
and
a
solid
take
on
the
style
if
this
is
nebcos
first
shot
at
a
berliner
i
applaud
that
effort
and
really
hope
more
is
in
the
works
throwing
this
in
a
can
was
awesome
but
if
only
the
can
was
oh
i
dont
know
24oz
instead
of
12
overall
a
very
solid
offering
from
a
very
solid
brewery
of
an
up
and
coming
style
thats
getting
more
and
more
popular
this
is
certainly
one
to
try
12oz
can
bought
at
the
brewery
pours
a
very
pale
translucent
straw
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
no
lacing
almost
looks
like
a
carbonated
glass
of
white
wine
smells
funky
and
sour
with
lemon
and
wheat
aromas
the
taste
is
a
big
sour
punch
of
lemon
up
front
with
some
sweetness
as
well
almost
like
a
sour
candy
some
wheat
flavor
followed
by
more
sour
lemon
at
the
finish
extremely
refreshing
and
insanely
drinkable
virtually
no
alcohol
presence
the
can
the
low
abv
and
the
drinkability
make
this
an
ideal
summer
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
every
sip
is
just
a
refreshing
burst
of
sour
lemon
and
wheat
i
was
hesitant
to
get
a
4
pack
at
the
brewery
because
this
isnt
a
style
i
drink
often
but
i
took
a
chance
anyways
and
im
glad
i
did
fantastic
brew
that
i
hope
gets
made
again
but
if
not
im
glad
i
bought
some
o
this
was
a
good
berliner
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
sour
for
its
own
good
i
like
my
berliners
to
be
consumable
and
relativity
easy
drinking
this
is
damn
tasty
stuff
and
really
feeding
my
sour
itch
but
multiples
of
this
would
just
seem
daunting
and
tums
inducing
another
nebco
home
run
really
need
to
seek
out
more
of
the
style
verdict
a
nice
berliner
from
bend
brewing
perhaps
a
bit
too
sour
for
my
tastes
but
the
hibiscus
is
showcased
well
decently
balanced
but
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
pomegranate
in
this
all
in
all
this
is
quite
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
definitely
would
be
a
go
to
if
i
was
local
for
summer
sessions
pour
is
darker
amber
lightly
hazed
tons
of
bubbly
white
head
that
sits
forever
nose
is
very
little
grain
heavy
lacto
a
bit
of
dusty
brett
lots
of
lemon
a
bit
sugary
flavor
is
also
too
sweet
again
virtually
no
grain
not
as
lactobrett
heavy
but
becomes
even
sweeter
lemon
and
candied
sugar
body
isnt
super
light
carb
is
pretty
spot
on
gets
a
little
juicy
this
is
excellent
and
real
unique
beer
i
think
the
pomegranate
comes
through
more
in
this
neon
pink
colored
berliner
weisse
than
in
any
other
beer
made
with
the
fruit
i
have
had
the
hibiscus
is
an
accent
flavor
and
aroma
rather
than
something
perfumy
and
overbearing
the
two
actually
go
quite
well
together
and
this
beer
is
very
sour
its
got
a
puckery
tart
nose
lactic
acid
and
lemon
notes
for
sure
and
then
the
fruit
and
flowers
over
the
top
of
it
the
sourness
is
really
developed
in
the
taste
too
insanely
tart
in
the
finish
especially
refreshing
but
my
one
real
critique
of
this
thing
is
that
it
cant
hold
a
head
and
that
its
carbonation
is
super
light
it
just
doesnt
feel
like
a
berliner
for
that
reason
ive
said
before
i
really
prefer
my
wild
ales
to
be
effervescent
not
that
its
flat
but
it
just
doesnt
sing
like
it
could
and
give
life
to
the
unique
flavors
great
fruit
flavor
though
and
a
really
interesting
finish
this
is
a
beer
unlike
most
others
and
probably
my
favorite
fruited
berliner
i
can
recall
a
refreshing
palate
pleaser
oh
i
wish
i
lived
in
bend
overall
what
a
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
i
love
finds
like
this
picked
up
at
random
at
a
grocery
store
in
bend
and
i
find
a
delicious
treat
bam
pours
a
hazy
light
red
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remainig
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
malt
grain
fruit
and
hibiscus
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
hibiscus
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
light
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
is
the
business
i
want
more
ching
ching
it
is
more
of
a
sour
beer
than
a
berlinner
weisse
but
i
have
no
complaints
about
the
overall
picture
in
reguards
to
ching
ching
this
beer
was
brewed
with
pomegranates
and
hibiscus
i
didnt
feel
that
either
of
those
elements
translated
into
the
nose
or
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
but
i
do
not
really
care
at
all
because
it
that
great
of
a
beer
my
advice
to
bend
brewing
company
is
dont
change
a
thing
with
this
beer
dark
ruby
red
pour
with
a
nice
head
smell
is
slightly
tart
cherries
taste
borders
between
a
berliner
weiss
and
an
american
fruit
sour
tartness
much
more
than
sour
and
id
give
the
nod
to
the
berliner
weiss
side
but
its
awesome
and
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
beer
every
day
if
available

me

an

the

going

a
little

soapy
but
thats
probably
not
the
beers
fault
it
has
been
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
several
months
that
said
the
tartness
really
held
up
here
in
the
taste
and
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
puckering

was
excellent
overall
a
very
very
good
brew
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
and
certainly
worth
some
effort
to
get
pours
a

a
medium

brings
out
fresh
tart

is
very

moderately

and
pomegranate
and
light

super
fruity
quite
tart
and
extremely
refreshing
great
depth
to
this
and
very
flavorful
very
good
overall
this
suffered
from
being
late
in
a
tasting
but
its
clean
and
tasty
id
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
berliner
and
i
love
night
shift
second
bottle
ive
had
the
pink
color
looks
amazing
you
can
detect
the
fruit
and
tartness
on
the
nose
almost
like
a
flavored
lemonade
the
body
is
just
so
quenching
and
easy
to
drink
this
tastes
like
pomegranate
juice
with
a
squeeze
of
lime
this
beer
won
gold
for
a
reason
clear
orange
amber
with
a
thin
pinkish
head
that
falls
off
to
a
ring
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
a
riot
hibiscus
floral
notes
fruity
pomegranate
lactic
tartness
some
pomegranate
seeds
bitterness
and
a
mild
bread
note
the
palate
opens
fruity
floral
with
the
hibiscus
flavors
rose
juice
working
really
well
with
pomegranate
and
the
sourness
there
is
a
sharpness
to
the
palate
clearly
lactic
but
with
a
touch
of
white
wine
vinegar
as
well
sharp
lactic
sourness
like
really
sharp
yogurt
on
the
finish
with
minimal
wheat
flavors
fruity
as
well
touch
of
seed
bitterness
light
in
body
moderately
carbonated
this
is
crisp
and
incredibly
refreshing
among
the
better
berliners
ive
had
recently
m
light
bodied
high
carbonation
very
nice
beer
from
the
folks
at
bend
brewing
incredibly
tasty
fruited
berliner
o
a
very
nice
sour
beer
exploding
with
big
fruit
flavors
especially
berry
fruits
such
an
easy
drinker
despite
the
pretty
intense
sourness
o
this
hits
all
the
right
points
to
be
a
very
good
beer
kudos
to
bend
for
turning
out
a
complicated
style
like
this
o
so
i
confess
that
i
thought
this
was
a
sour
ale
and
not
a
bw
at
first
and
its
funny
how
reading
the
label
drastically
changed
my
perception
of
this
its
a
great
beer
that
showcases
the
pomegranate
and
hibiscus
well
even
nicer
that
i
get
touches
of
raspberries
even
if
they
arent
actually
present
in
the
beer
i
dare
say
you
wont
be
disappointed
what
a
great
beer
i
sat
near
the
window
and
watched
the
wind
bring
in
autumn
the
leaves
sailing
down
the
street
in
one
hand
my
glass
held
the
nectar
the
nectar
that
sours
strive
to
be
ching
ching
it
wasnt
the
empty
can
rolling
down
the
road
it
was
the
incredible
beer
that
was
in
my
hand
i
smiled
at
the
beer
and
it
kissed
my
palate
overall
impressive
o
light
and
tart
fruity
and
pleasant
one
finger
pinkish
white
head
fairly
big
bubbles
ultraquick
dissipation
on
top
of
lovely
rouge
colored
hazy
body
this
beer
just
wont
drop
clear
i
know
this
frustrated
tonya
on
v
1
very
little
visible
carbonation
just
a
few
bubbles
clinging
to
side
of
tulip
glass
and
once
those
were
gone
it
was
pretty
flat
the
floral
notes
from
hops
and
hibiscus
were
prominent
in
the
nose
along
with
huge
dose
of
pomegranate
syrup
taste
is
features
the
fruit
up
front
more
tart
than
sour
to
they
make
pomegranate
sweet
tarts
and
the
hibiscus
dried
out
the
finish
not
a
lot
of
effervescence
present
in
the
fairly
light
mouthfeel
pretty
refreshing
a
fairly
unique
tasting
experience
not
for
pomegranate
playerhaters
a
real
sipper
refreshing
an
okay
beer
the
flavours
are
pleasant
but
it
lacks
depth
overall
is
really
good
an
excellent
summer
offering
glad
i
have
another
one
of
these
i
expect
fruit
infused
beers
to
still
have
an
authentic
beer
like
character
while
i
found
this
interesting
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
wine
cooler
and
less
of
a
fruit
beer
and
i
am
a
fan
of
berliner
weisse
and
a
variety
of
fruit
ales
sorry
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
overall
this
is
ok
well
made
but
the
cherry
is
the
highlight
and
it
isnt
that
fantastic
just
the
right
amount
of
sourness
mixed
with
a
touch
of
delicious
cherry
not
too
sweet
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
as
with
all
of
these
from
schells
i
enjoy
them
the
base
flavors
seem
amazingly
consistent
and
fortunately
i
enjoy
them
glad
these
are
around
has
a
big
cherry
nose
with
a
trace
of
tartness
it
pours
brilliant
effervescent
cherry
red
with
a
quickly
dissipating
1
white
foam
cap
big
cherry
flavors
dominate
the
palate
with
lemon
in
the
background
and
very
faint
grain
flavors
it
finishes
tart
and
dry
it
is
a
very
refreshing
light
and
drinkable
beer
not
syrup
or
cloying
in
anyway
o
im
a
cherry
fan
im
always
up
for
this
flavor
in
my
beer
including
sours
very
glad
i
grabbed
this
one
sour
red
not
much
carbonation
tart
really
cherry
taste
o
tasty
tart
take
on
a
classic
german
sour
style
of
beer
really
enjoyed
the
tart
cherry
flavors
august
schell
has
really
impressed
me
and
this
beer
doesnt
disappoint
a
unique
and
very
tasty
berliner
black
forest
cherry
pours
a
cloudy
dark
reddish
color
with
a
very
small
non
lacing
head
there
is
a
strong
tart
cherry
flavor
the
taste
is
tart
slightly
sour
big
fresh
cherry
flavors
nice
body
good
feel
not
too
sweet
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
with
great
hints
of
cherry
this
beer
really
benefits
with
a
little
breathing
the
cherry
opens
up
wide
and
the
experience
overall
is
more
enjoyable
this
is
a
good
take
on
a
cherry
forward
berliner
from
the
fine
people
at
schells
it
doesnt
quite
match
the
lofty
expectations
of
the
original
but
its
still
excellent
and
sitting
even
shouldered
with
the
other
two
releases
worth
drinking
without
a
doubt
tart
cherries
lots
of
funk
some
lemon
dry
finish
better
as
it
warms
up
eh
not
too
thrilled
especially
at
the
unschelllike
price
point
it
is
dare
i
say
it
boring
decent
but
after
not
enjoying
2
in
the
series
either
i
think
ill
look
to
wi
for
my
berliner
fix
o
this
works
pretty
well
i
could
even
be
convinced
that
there
is
some
smoky
chocolate
in
here
too
4
overall
another
very
good
wheat
beer
in
this
series
good
taste
of
cherries
and
funk
with
a
nice
balanced
sweetness
light
bodied
lively
carbonation
easy
drinking
this
is
far
better
than
most
american
fruit
wheat
beers
if
you
want
a
very
tart
cherry
brew
and
can
find
this
get
it
before
it
is
gone
overall
an
exciting
beer
if
youre
at
all
into
traditional
beers
and
especially
berliners
schell
has
gone
to
great
lengths
and
you
can
taste
it
here
i
would
recommend
chilling
but
then
letting
it
warm
up
in
the
bottle
for
1520
minutes
i
thought
it
was
just
ok
and
very
thin
when
ice
cold
but
quite
delicious
as
it
warmed
up
this
is
a
great
way
to
get
those
friends
who
love
new
glarus
belgian
red
to
jump
over
into
more
authentic
sours

schell
in
star
of
the
north
probably
makes
my
favorite
berliner
weiss
that
i
have
yet
to
come
across
its
not
the
newfangled
sour
6ers
but
a
traditional
berliner
style
wheat
with
low
alcohol
loads
of
flavor
and
a
brightness
with
no
end
buy
this
beer
if
you
see
it
it
holds
up
very
well
sorry
schells
brewing
but
this
beer
is
not
good
its
not
my
style
i
realize
this
beer
is
made
specifically
to
taste
the
way
it
does
but
i
did
not
like
it
my
poor
rating
wont
hurt
though
because
there
is
a
pretty
strong
group
that
likes
star
of
the
north
its
the
only
offering
from
schells
i
havent
enjoyed
so
theres
plenty
of
options
for
me
o
quite
tasty
maybe
not
my
favorite
base
berliner
out
there
but
very
well
done
recommended
for
a
nice
summery
drink
overall
a
well
made
berliner
with
a
really
nice
level
of
sour
overall
simple
and
well
brewed
to
style
o
excellent
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
love
this
only
3
5
but
its
got
enough
complexity
where
you
can
sip
and
enjoy
great
job
here
m
lighter
side
of
medium
fairly
high
carbonation
do
clean
and
traditional
quite
refreshing
although
it
seems
a
bit
lifeless
after
it
is
allowed
to
sit
it
is
nice
to
see
a
domestic
berlinerweisse
executed
by
the
numbers
star
of
the
north
is
a
real
treat
only
3
5
percent
abv
not
to
worry
this
thing
is
packed
with
tangy
sweet
and
sour
flavors
that
work
wonderfully
together
please
make
this
again
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
berliner
thats
pretty
crushable
if
this
were
available
locally
id
buy
it
regularly
i
dig
the
authenticity
with
the
wood
fermentation
vessels
and
wild
yeast
and
theres
tons
of
flavor
here
for
a
3
5
beer
hope
schells
makes
this
a
regular
star
of
the
north
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
doesnt
quit
there
is
a
flowery
pale
aroma
the
taste
is
fruity
light
and
crisp
very
tart
mellow
fruity
flavors
good
full
flavors
great
body
overall
its
a
very
nice
drinking
light
berliner
weissbier
im
liking
this
lots
good
choice
on
schells
part
to
put
it
in
a
large
bottle
at
a
high
price
not
everyones
going
to
want
to
down
this
by
the
12pack
hardly
anyone
actually
and
also
cheers
to
them
for
actually
brewing
such
a
thing
one
of
the
better
american
berliner
weisse
examples
out
there
hope
they
continue
making
this
in
the
future
overall
this
is
the
best
berlinner
weiss
that
i
have
ever
drank
its
a
true
bench
mark
of
the
beer
style
its
a
timeless
beer
that
i
dont
think
that
i
could
ever
get
tired
of
it
this
is
the
first
and
only
beer
that
august
shell
has
brewed
that
really
impressed
me
this
is
a
go
to
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
to
quench
your
thirst
better
than
water
i
think
that
this
beer
has
a
niche
similiar
to
a
table
beer
because
it
will
hold
up
well
with
any
meal
or
food
you
could
think
of
this
beer
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
a
few
more
bottles
of
it
this
is
the
best
berliner
weiss
ive
ever
had
beats
out
new
glarus
offering
for
sure
its
fuller
bodied
with
much
stronger
flavours
with
a
puny
3
5
abv
hit
i
strongly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
berliner
weiss
style
overall
a
really
good
take
on
the
berliner
weissbier
style
good
fruity
and
acidic
wine
presence
with
an
interesting
kick
from
the
brett
nicely
done
very
solid
berliner
weisse
and
extremely
authentic
for
the
style
one
of
the
funkier
ones
out
there
for
sure
wet
blankets
and
bales
of
old
hay
left
and
right
balanced
by
a
great
tartness
that
only
imparts
tingling
levels
of
acidity
in
your
throat
mmmmmm
good
the
second
time
i
had
this
with
doug
we
mixed
in
some
raspberries
and
simple
syrup
i
recommend
this
as
well
overall
berliner
weiss
is
an
interesting
style
and
schells
is
a
very
good
example
tart
lemony
with
a
dry
finish
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
the
summer
to
mix
in
among
the
pilsners
wheats
and
pales
ok
this
is
my
first
review
but
when
i
opened
the
bottle
and
started
to
drink
this
beer
i
ran
right
away
to
see
what
this
stuff
was
i
was
very
surprised
to
see
how
highly
this
was
rated
here
i
am
not
a
beer
expert
necessarily
but
i
drink
beer
in
the
1018
12
pack
so
i
dont
drink
swill
either
i
expected
this
to
be
like
other
wheat
beers
i
have
had
and
enjoyed
namely
a
paulaner
hefe
or
others
that
i
have
had
i
do
not
want
to
be
too
harsh
because
this
may
very
well
be
and
by
the
reviews
i
believe
it
is
exactly
how
this
beer
should
look
and
taste
but
i
have
to
say
this
tastes
similar
to
stomach
bile
to
me
specifically
the
taste
of
regurgitating
beer
when
having
a
few
too
many
so
anyway
this
did
not
agree
with
my
palette
and
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
for
those
of
you
who
like
this
i
say
awesome
and
thanks
for
supporting
my
local
brewer
as
noted
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
well
done
now
to
do
with
with
some
syryp
overall
delicious
and
refreshing
an
excellent
beer
o
a
very
nice
berliner
weisse
everything
in
perfect
balance
great
sour
that
comes
cork
and
caged
by
schells
brewing
considering
its
the
first
of
its
kind
by
them
overall
great
smell
and
tastes
very
light
and
crisp
slight
sour
taste
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable
i
am
looking
forward
to
more
like
this
from
this
brewery
beautifully
crafted
beer
i
totally
understand
why
people
are
digging
it
very
good
bordering
on
excellent
doubtless
one
of
the
top
5
3
5
abv
brews
in
the
milky
way
a
really
nice
berliner
weisse
has
a
great
green
midsummer
wheat
feel
and
the
touch
of
sour
makes
it
all
the
more
refreshing
wow
second
berliner
weisse
i
have
ever
tried
and
this
was
amazing
bready
goodness
with
clean
crisp
lemony
lactic
acidity
that
fills
the
pallet
slight
funk
but
no
horse
leather
funk
that
comes
with
brett
fermented
beers
very
champagne
like
extrememly
enjoyable
had
with
some
improvised
rasberry
simple
syrup
and
was
superb
with
and
without
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
golden
yellow
with
about
an
inch
of
pure
white
head
medium
retention
with
little
lacing
some
bready
malt
sweetness
on
the
nose
but
mostly
a
lacticcitric
tart
aroma
smells
great
when
you
first
drink
there
is
some
malt
sweetness
that
is
slightly
bready
and
even
slightly
fruity
although
i
found
it
hard
to
nail
this
down
this
was
replaced
very
quickly
though
by
a
clean
tartness
that
i
found
very
well
balanced
and
by
no
means
over
whelming
thinking
green
apples
and
champagne
nice
dry
finish
the
tart
lingers
nicely
and
there
is
a
touch
of
funk
in
the
after
taste
that
could
be
attributed
to
either
the
yeast
or
the
old
cypress
tanks
the
beer
was
aged
in
the
body
is
light
and
easy
drinking
although
perhaps
under
carbonated
this
beer
is
fantastic
both
my
wife
and
i
loved
it
a
great
summer
beer
for
a
schells
product
i
was
floored
not
that
they
are
a
bad
brewery
but
this
is
far
above
the
bar
for
them
i
am
headed
back
to
the
bottle
shop
for
a
few
more
of
these
kudos
to
jace
marti
and
crew
at
schells
in
new
ulm
minnesota
o
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
and
the
best
berliner
ive
had
to
date
i
really
dont
know
if
this
beer
could
be
any
better
a
perfect
summer
beer
and
a
perfect
berliner
in
my
opinion
i
dont
even
like
too
many
schells
beers
they
are
usually
a
one
and
done
company
for
me
i
buy
things
to
try
their
new
beers
and
then
never
really
try
it
again
this
beer
was
different
a
day
after
trying
it
i
bought
all
of
it
i
could
find
try
this
beer
and
buy
a
lot
they
need
to
keep
this
one
overall
nice
to
finally
have
a
more
authentic
example
of
the
style
as
bells
oarsman
and
dogfish
head
festina
pecha
hardly
count
and
the
only
german
one
i
had
was
heavy
up
on
brett
which
was
very
good
but
this
is
just
fantastic
refreshingly
tart
and
ridiculously
drinkable
i
am
excited
to
see
where
schell
takes
this
new
noble
star
series
as
it
essentially
give
them
a
line
of
sours
albeit
germanstyle
sours
and
this
is
a
great
switch
up
from
the
now
familiar
belgian
varieties
what
i
love
even
more
is
how
schells
a
brewery
that
recently
failed
the
craft
brewery
label
test
is
putting
this
out
they
brew
wonderful
representations
of
german
styles
and
never
try
to
be
anything
theyre
not
they
dont
even
brew
a
pale
ale
let
alone
an
ipa
i
am
proud
to
have
these
guys
in
mn
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
can
find
it
and
this
definitely
worth
trading
for
if
you
cant
cheers
light
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
has
a
tart
lemon
aftertaste
and
finishes
dry
this
is
a
very
nice
berliner
weissbier
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
not
just
in
summer
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
love
the
tart
lemon
characteristics
very
well
made
berliner
but
again
i
have
not
had
to
many
berliners
to
compare
it
to
im
a
fan
overall
a
wonderful
beer
and
if
more
people
drank
it
it
could
turn
them
on
to
the
style
i
love
finding
refreshing
and
crisp
beers
that
are
full
flavored
and
sessionable
can
have
a
few
and
not
stumble
around
well
done
schells
overall
this
beer
is
spot
on
i
know
i
am
not
a
bweisse
expert
but
this
tastes
very
german
and
authentic
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
provides
way
more
flavor
than
you
would
expect
from
a
3
5
beer
a
must
try
easily
my
favorite
berliner
to
date
schells
keep
it
crafty
down
there
in
new
ulm
otasty
and
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
love
this
style
with
not
alot
of
offerings
on
the
shelf
happy
that
schells
did
a
proper
berliner
weissbier
instead
of
the
halfhearted
attempts
by
most
other
brewers
i
am
definitely
going
to
pick
up
another
bottle
and
let
it
sit
for
a
year
or
two
as
i
think
this
will
develop
into
a
real
fascinating
beer
overall
perfectly
balanced
fresh
and
clean
with
just
enough
bread
cracker
and
sour
apple
to
make
it
interesting
seems
like
a
good
pairing
would
be
any
cheese
with
penicillin
a
good
crisp
pale
cracker
and
a
slice
of
granny
smith
or
mulberries
at
three
percent
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
this
is
a
great
tart
beer
tart
citrus
berliner
style
could
knock
back
a
6er
of
this
on
a
summer
day
easily
o
tart
would
be
more
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
than
with
the
3
feet
of
snow
im
staring
at
not
much
to
look
at
like
most
berliner
weissbiers
not
much
head
or
lacing
nice
smell
you
get
the
citrus
more
of
a
lemon
with
some
funk
excellent
flavor
similar
to
the
smell
some
citrus
and
very
tart
very
low
on
the
abv
but
this
would
be
an
unbelievable
summer
hot
weather
beer
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
nice
and
more
tart

your
average
berliner

while
this
one
is
definitely
in
the
realm
of
a
sour
very
good
but
an
unexpected
amount
of
pucker
o
i
enjoyed
this
but
found
some
of
the
flavors
and
sensations
to
be
slightly
off
i
have
found
many
berliner
weisses
lately
that
surpass
this
so
the
competition
is
getting
stiffer
o
not
awesome
but
nice
to
find
an
example
in
this
style
that
is
assumedly
close
to
the
original
style
of
the
beer
bought
at
bruisin
ales
asheville
drank
at
deerfield
beach
fl
o
i
enjoyed
the
surprising
balance
between
lacto
and
malt
flavors
here
many
domesticallyproduced
examples
seem
to
focus
on
the
wild
qualities
and
eschew
malt
flavors
essentially
making
the
beers
flat
and
dry
i
could
do
this
one
again
recommended
poured
into
a
new
glarus
pils
glass
it
was
convenient
and
somewhat
appropriate
for
the
style
hazy

a
small

that
sank

in

tartness
slightly
acidic
apple
skin
cereal
grains
sourdough
honey
the
latter
of
which
came
out
a

the

warmed
in
the
aroma
and
taste
leaving
a
residual
sweetness
in
the
finish
lightbodied
crisp
and
enjoyable
overall
overall
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
it
is
fabulous
and
i
actually
appreciate
the
low
abv
it
makes
it
easy
just
to
kick
back
and
have
a
beer
with
a
great
deal
of
flavor
and
complexity
and
still
be
able
to
go
about
doing
stuff
without
feeling
a
bit
fuzzy
oa
decent
berlinner
weisse
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
an
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
that
i
had

i
really
wish
i
could
have
done
it
justice

a
bottle
o
unlike
many
other
berliner
weisses
this
beer
is
all
about
the
bacteria
and
features
very
little
wheatmalt
or
yeast
character
id
prefer
a
bit
more
wheat
character
but
this
is
pretty
nice
fast
forward
to
tonight
230am
on
a
september
saturday
night
i
pop
open
a
bottle
i
ended
up
ordering
online
and
every
single
thing
i
remembered
from
this
beer
came
back
immediately
absolutely
my
favorite
in
a
style
i
was
not
really
a
fan
of
this
made
me
fall
in
love
i
first
tried
this
backtoback
with
the
bretted
version
but
that
was
a
while
ago
and
i
only
have
this
bottle
now
cool
story
bro
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
lightly
hazy
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mildlytart
lemon
zest
a
twist
of
tart
orange
zest
some
light
sweet
flowers
and
a
touch
of
mild
sweet
biscuit
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
tartness
throughout
however
due
to
its
incredible
lightness
and
crispness
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
only
lasts
a
short
time
leaving
a
small
squad
of
tartness
to
linger
for
a
bit
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
damn
solid
berliner
something
that
can
deliver
some
sour
without
tearing
the
enamel
from
your
teeth
and
can
do
so
on
a
nicely
regular
interval
pretty
good
berliner
overall
i
plan
on
getting
some
more
perfect
for
summer
overall
nice
berliner
could
use
a
little
more
pop
it
pours
a
murky
yellowbrown
color
kind
of
like
straw
theres
one
fingers
worth
of
head
and
it
disappears
within
seconds
no
retention
and
no
lacing
whatsoever
theres
citrus
on
the
nose
with
some
yeasty
bread
as
well
but
not
much
going
on
the
first
thing
that
hits
me
is
the
carbonation
which
is
very
aggressive
then
the
tartness
hits
me
its
very
tart
and
the
depth
of
flavour
isnt
quite
there
to
balance
it
out
or
back
it
up
i
find
that
im
puckering
more
than
im
savoring
it
theres
some
lemon
and
orange
going
on
and
overall
its
a
refreshing
berliner
but
thats
about
all
it
has
going
for
it
its
a
onetrick
pony
and
far
from

extremely
smooth

were
the
winner
vs
the

this
was

quite
good
way
way
too
easy
to

i
killed
my
glass
in
under
ten
minutes
its
really
too
bad
the
style
is
hard
to
find
and
expensive
this
would
get
swilled
during
the
summertimes
an
interesting
berliner
lower
abv
than
ive
seen
in
one
of
these
the
pour
looks
like
lemonade
really
pale
yellow
almost
white
really
with
a
lot
of
haze
and
not
much
head
the
nose
is
very
lemony
but
also
a
little
more
wheat
malt
to
this
than
i
expected
based
on
the
color
also
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
apparently
to
counteract
the
intense
acidic
and
citrus
bitterness
the
flavor
doesnt
really
hold
onto
much
of
that
malt
character
or
the
sweetness
maybe
just
a
touch
of
floral
perfume
essence
amidst
the
piquant
sour
flavor
lemon
zest
and
acid
in
the
finish
typical
of
the
style
its
a
very
good
version
but
it
comes
through
a
little
thin
even
for
this
genre
also
soda
like
carbonation
may
be
a
little
over
the
top
still
the
beer
is
yummy
and
refreshing
i
will
enjoy
this
even
more
come
summer
weather
which
has
to
be
about
due
right
i
think
the
gose
from
these
guys
was
a
bit
more
refined
but
both
are
solid
choices
if
you
can
find
them
overall
supereasy
to
drink
and
given
the
abv
you
could
make
a
night
of
these
if
i
ever
see
these
for
sale
around
me
i
havent
yet
i
would
buy
a
case
o
its
definitely
a
nice
berliner
fairly
easy
to
find
in
the
area
and
not
overly
expensive
not
earth
changing
for
the
style
but
really
no
complaints
not
the
cleanest
berliner
fairly
sharp
and
acidic
at
every
turn
but
it
definitely
packs
a
little
punch
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
at
3abv
thats
a
welcomed
sign
should
have
this
one
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
nice
maybe
ill
try
it
with
some
sort
of
syrup
next
time
overall
lacks
balance
but
a
very
tart
and
refreshing
beer
in
general
i
like
sour
beers
and
this
is
a
good
take
on
the
style
flavor
is
much
better
than
appearance
thank
goodness
its
a
decent
bweiss
but
no
where
near
the
best
or
top
recommended
but
at
512oz
think
twice
could
use
more
carbonation
although
the
sourness
does
a
good
job
of
creating
a
prickling
sensation
anyway
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
and
a
good
intro
into
sours
id
buy
this
again
only
if
it
was
the
only
berliner
weisse
on
the
shelf
with
that
being
said
i
can
imagine
the
brett
l
version
of
this
being
fantastic
medium
bodied
and
thankfully
more
interesting
than
the
aroma
suggests
with
a
nice
balance
of
funk
and
citric
acidity
its
still
light
and
pretty
tame
for
the
style
but
you
can
at
least
pick
up
the
wheat
beer
characteristics
only
slightly
tart
with
more
of
a
lactic
presence
than
expected
countered
by
sweet
citrus
bready
yeast
and
mild
spicy
faint
peppery
clove
flavor
countered
by
hints
of
lemon
juice
and
sourdough
bread
not
too
exciting
but
well
balance
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
a
decent
brew
with
parts
i
really
like
and
a
few
things
missing
still
i
would
have
this
again
bottle
poured
alight
hazy
color
weisse
with
a
large
slightly
offwhite
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
some
great
lacing
aroma
consists
of
slightly
tart
nose
with
some
salty
notes
and
light
herbal
finish
taste
is
a
weird
mix
between
some
light
tart
notes
with
some
distinct
salty
notes
body
is
about
average
with
a
smooth
texture
and
great
carbonation
must
be
me
but
i
felt
too
much
salt
in
this
beer
and
not
enough
tart
notes
o
enjoyable
on
a
warm
late
afternoon
easy
to
drink
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
lightly
funky
on
the
nose
popcorn
grass
lactobacillus
and
some
lemon
a
bit
of
lemon
peel
wheat
bread
and
hints
of
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
quite
crisp
dry
and
tart
lots
of
lactic
acidity
lemon
and
lemon
peel
some
straw
a
touch
of
unripe
strawberry
grass
and
a
light
malt
sweetness
with
a
definite
wheat
and
popcorn
character
its
pretty
dry
very
clean
it
is
enjoyable
as
long
as
you
dont
think
about
how
much
you
paid
for
it
a
great
option
on
a
hot
day
and
limitless
wallet
o
the
taste
is
significantly
better
than
the
very
faint
nose
but
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
acidity
its
quite
dry
and
tart
but
there
is
no
real
acidic
punch
the
spicy
aftertaste
is
a
bit
offputting
too
crisp
and
light
with
a
bit
of
a
creamy
flow
the
feel
is
good
and
refreshing
at
that
i
think
i
waited
a
bit
long
on
this
one
as
the
malts
are
kind
of
stale
good
thing
there
isnt
much
of
them
haha
there
is
a
nice
sourness
to
it
that
is
light
and
refreshing
this
would
be
an
absolutely
perfect
beer
to
have
after
mowing
the
yard
after
having
more
than
a
handful
of
berliners
i
think
i
prefer
the
ones
that
have
a
little
more
malt
and
alcohol
to
them
like
the
1809
and
the
dfh
festina
very
good
though
and
would
love
to
try
a
fresher
sample
light
sourness
and
acidity
but
very
palatable
this
is
perfect
for
a
hot
humid
summer
day
the
3
alcohol
only
makes
this
easier
to
drink
some
straw
and
light
bread
in
the
malt
character
but
the
fermentation
and
yeast
drive
this
o
this
is
a
great
brew
that
fits
into
a
style
more
people
need
to
make
the
berliner
is
sooo
good
for
summer
and
worth
every
penny
buy
this
beer
if
you
see
it
and
if
you
like
berliners
because
its
worth
it
delightful
decent
enough
and
incredibly
drinkable
though
the
wheat
flavors
dominate
and
i
was
wishing
for
more
lemonapplesour
flavors
simple
pours
a
lively
light
yellow
ale
with
four
fingers
of
lingering
white
foam
smells
of
light
lactic
acid
and
almost
a
sour
milk
smell
actually
quite
pleasant
when
paired
with
the
wheat
tones
flavor
is
mealy
with
some
nice
subdued
lactic
sourness
and
hints
of
a
yogurt
tone
honestly
its
okay
but
nothing
special
medium
bodied
with
hi
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
nice
beer
not
as
good
as
their
gose
imo
very
refreshing
big
on
sour
lemon
with
a
nice
surprising
finish
i
drank
a
lot
of
beers
to
get
to
500
reviews
and
this
was
not
one
of
the
better
ones
not
exactly
forgettable
because
i
will
definitely
remember
how
subpar
this
one
was
oh
well
live
and
learn
i
suppose
d
i
find
the
sour
oj
aromatastes
rather
offputting
after
it
subsides
the
brew
becomes
rather
refreshing
and
enjoyable
like
many
other
berliner
weisses
also
i
have
read
these
brews
typically
have
no
head
on
them
so
i
am
a
little
unsure
what
to
think
of
the
frothy
head
that
came
with
this
brew
meh
sort
of
middle
of
the
road
in
my
opinion
simple
refreshing
strong
flavored
beer
gimme
another
give
it
here
easy
to
get
always
on
shelf
i
know
that
shouldnt
matter
but
light
and
easy
to
drink
would
pair
well
with
salad
or
fish
pours
a
moderatelight
golden
color
with
a
short
white
head
and
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
nose
carries
some
bready
malt
and
a
very
faint
acidity
not
much
going
on
the
flavor
has
a
light
breadiness
and
no
real
acidity
perhaps
a
touch
if
i
imagine
it
this
really
does
not
get
into
the
style
light
body
and
crisp
carbonation
acidity
is
near
negligible
boring
and
way
too
plain
o
overall
a
decent
berlinerweiss
not
the
sourest
out
there
but
considering
you
can
just
buy
it
off
the
shelf
worth
checking
out
lightly
sour
in
the
nose
and
moreso
in
the
taste
well
this
is
the
lowest
abv
berliner
weisee
ive
had
recently
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
and
the
low
acidity
would
make
it
that
much
easier
to
do
i
wish
it
was
summer
surprisingly
i
cant
find
this
particular
bw
in
the
philly
area
which
is
odd
mpretty
full
bodied
for
a
low
abv
beer
really
just
the
aftertaste
that
bothers
me
but
makes
this
hard
to
drink
i
will
buy
another
and
re
review
o
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
super
easy
to
drink
quite
sessionable
and
at
3
0
abv
you
could
probably
put
down
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
setting
with
no
adverse
effects
i
would
describe
the
beer
as
refreshing
i
was
definitely
hoping
for
more
out
of
this
beer
but
it
scored
high
marks
in
the
worst
2
areas
ill
sip
this
one
without
the
syrup
next
time
just
to
know
whats
going
on
with
the
beer
by
itself
but
as
far
as
the
style
goes
with
syrup
its
excellent
overall
a
very
nice
berliner
weisse
an
acceptable
sour
for
those
with
the
palette
for
it
sours
native
to
germany
may
even
predate
the
lambics
of
belgium
two
words
actually
is
drain
pour
still
two
words
or
is
it
one
now
drain
pour
anyway
ouch
not
one
of
my
favourite
berliner
weisses
and
one
which
makes
me
question
the
genre
yet
again
probably
just
really
needs
that
woodruff
syrup
oaverage
b
quality
nothing
special
but
glad
to
compare
it
to
the
style
overall
impression
not
my
favorite
and
for
the
price
i
paid
for
it
not
worth
it
i
was
about
to
become
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
at
all
no
sourness
to
it
at
all
and
just
really
tasted
like
a
european
light
brew
or
a
czech
pilsner
with
a
bit
of
lemon
im
going
to
be
inquiring
about
more
top
of
the
line
brews
that
are
in
this
price
range
before
making
a
purchase
next
time
live
and
learn
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
i
like
the
low
abv
and
the
refreshing
qualities
it
isnt
my
favorite
and
i
probably
will
not
seek
it
out
again
but
it
was
decent
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
nothing
but
a
slight
ring
and
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
aromas
of
tart
green
apple
lemon
zest
wheat
and
yogurt
dominates
very
crisp
and
lactic
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
the
yogurt
character
stands
out
the
most
imagine
a
lemon
yogurt
with
wheat
granola
and
you
have
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
inviting
with
a
thin
body
and
sharp
spritzy
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
berliner
weiss
that
bring
a
lot
to
the
table
with
its
high
level
of
lactic
character
a
really
good
beer
which
is
a
nice
satisfying
session
funk
poured
a
3
white
head
slightly
hazy
lemonade
yellow
colored
body
smells
of
spice
and
banana
taste
has
a
general
fruitiness
but
also
an
interesting
combination
of
sweet
sour
and
downright
tart
its
surprisingly
fresh
for
an
import
all
in
all
id
say
this
is
indeed
a
standout
of
a
weisse
although
i
personally
dont
go
for
high
on
the
tart
and
sour
side
meh
not
impressed
somehow
too
delicate
for
the
style
which
is
odd
i
know
but
not
nearly
enough
tartness
compared
to
the
gems
ive
had
in
the
style
if
this
is
the
style
a
for
making
a
beer
in
that
style
however
i
now
can
decide
that
its
a
terrible
style
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
this
has
some
seriously
odd
flavor
i
detect
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
much
stronger
than
anticipated
it
is
a
sour
type
of
flavor
but
it
is
not
an
acidic
sourness
like
sour
ales
this
is
a
pleasanttasting
and
mostly
inviting
berlinerweisse
while
i
like
and
mostly
prefer
stronger
variations
on
the
style
i
do
like
this
and
wouldnt
mind
having
another
o
great
summer
sour
beer
and
a
good
interpretation
of
this
style
o
i
am
pretty
sure
i
bought
an
old
bottle
which
might
be
the
price
one
pays
for
loving
such
an
unappreciated
style
still
the
style
generally
holds
up
well
to
aging
so
the
review
will
stand
hopefully
i
find
some
fresh
bottles
and
have
reason
to
revise
this
review
i
was
told
i
was
hard
core
for
refusing
syrup
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
fizzy
high
level
of
carbonation
it
is
super
crisp
and
refreshing
no
indication
of
alcohol
inclusion
and
one
just
isnt
enough
yes
sir
may
i
please
have
another
clear
light
golden
colored
the
beer
has
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
fruity
and
slightly
musty
aroma
the
beer
lacks
the
funky
andor
lactic
presence
i
have
come
to
enjoy
in
beers
of
this
ilk
the
body
is
thin
with
light
carbonation
subtle
zestiness
average
difficult
to
finish
the
bottle
i
wont
order
this
again
dvery
easy
drinking
and
i
could
see
this
being
a
real
staple
in
the
summer
months
if
only
i
could
find
a
local
example
of
this
one
to
have
around
in
the
fridge
regularly
d
i
could
drink
a
beer
like
this
all
night
not
huge
but
very
flavorful
on
the
palate
and
the
low
abv
makes
this
unbeatable
good
stuff
i
really
enjoyed
it
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
lift
and
sip
savoring
the
sour
complex
notes
of
varying
sourness
battling
on
my
tongue
very
light
bodied
and
packed
full
of
flavor
i
didnt
realize
this
was
going
to
be
so
lovely
not
at
all
disappointed
here
ill
be
revisiting
sooner
or
later
very
pale
yellow
with
a
silver
hue
no
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
a
pleasant
lactc
sourness
on
the
nose
along
with
sour
cherry
buttermilk
is
prevalent
the
taste
reveals
sourdough
starter
with
tart
citrus
and
more
lactic
acid
notes
nice
for
the
style
but
i
did
a
bit
more
than
a
3
beer
at
6
49
a
bottle
great
balance
of
tartness
in
this
beer
some
wheat
character
but
as
appropriate
the
citric
character
is
center
stage
not
as
lemony
and
more
of
a
generaized
citrus
note
tangy
but
not
jaw
clenchingly
sour
and
the
tart
note
did
not
grow
or
become
too
much
as
the
beer
progressed
one
of
the
few
of
this
style
that
i
could
session
overall
it
is
definitely
a
unique
hefe
but
the
abv
is
oddly
low
that
makes
it
taste
too
much
like
a
juice
to
me
one
is
enough
and
id
probably
pass
on
it
the
next
time
i
saw
it
pours
a
very
murky
and
watery
brown
with
absolutely
zero
head
very
spotty
strands
of
lace
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
wheat
slight
lemon
and
very
faint
vinegar
taste
is
of
wheat
and
weak
lemon
very
little
tartness
for
this
beer
which
is
odd
for
this
style
good
carbonation
with
a
light
easy
drinking
body
this
beer
isnt
too
good
i
was
hoping
for
a
tartness
that
just
wasnt
there
i
would
not
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
overall
this
is
a
nice
middleoftheroad
berlinerweiss
nothing
stands
out
as
exceptional
but
its
something
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
especially
in
warmer
weather
worth
a
shot
d
as
i
mentioned
earlier
i
wouldnt
feel
bad
drinking
this
for
breakfast
and
then
showing
up
to
work
its
almost
nonalcoholic
by
some
standards
and
i
can
see
why
its
popular
that
said
its
not
particularly
complexabout
as
interesting
as
apple
juice
some
woodruff
or
raspberry
syrup
really
would
help
i
appreciate
the
style
but
this
one
needs
a
bit
more
the
cpj
i
must
say
that
they
served
it
with
some
cherry
syrup
which
i
added
to
a
small
amount
of
the
beer
i
preferred
the
beer
as
is
though
so
drank
most
of
it
without
any
additive
taste
is
light
yeasty
funkiness
up
front
then
lightly
fruity
character
with
pear
and
lemon
then
light
aromatic
grain
lightly
tart
and
citric
it
is
not
full
of
flavour
and
rather
on
the
thin
bland
side
but
still
good
and
refreshing
poured
a
pale
golden
with
a
frothy
white
head
aromas
of
granny
smith
apple
lemons
and
kinda
bready
tasted
much
the
same
with
a
pleasant
tartness
light
carbonation
super
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
long
on
any
summer
day
very
drinkable
beer
good
summertime
thirst
quencher
overall
very
refereshing
beer
great
for
a
summer
afternoon
that
being
said
i
still
enjoyed
the
beer
even
thought
its
in
the
teens
outside
will
drink
the
beer
again
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
despite
the
mild
amount
of
sourness
the
beer
is
very
sessionable
given
its
low
alcohol
content
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
lots
of
haze
a
quick
dissipating
head
the
nose
reminds
me
of
straw
and
wheat
i
was
hoping
for
more
tartness
the
taste
is
full
of
wheat
and
pale
malts
and
with
a
tart
and
sour
bite
to
it
that
is
mellowed
by
the
wheat
sharp
carbonation
rather
thin
and
thirst
quenching
this
is
something
i
could
quaff
all
day
in
copious
amounts
during
the
hot
summer
months
trying
a
new
berliner
weiss
is
always
fun
there
arent
enough
of
these
brewed
ill
probably
be
drinking
this
one
again
in
the
future
lets
be
honest
any
berliner
weisse
can
be
drinkable
but
this
one
just
so
happens
to
do
its
own
thing
as
well
its
a
beer
worthy
of
cookout
chug
sessions
and
thoughtful
afterdinner
sipping
i
cant
think
of
a
higher
compliment
than
that
cheers
dvery
drinkable
i
was
somewhat
expecting
something
sour
but
this
isnt
close
drinkable
though
nonetheless
overall
this
is
an
average
wheat
beer
which
would
be
truly
awesome
on
a
hot
day
after
a
long
bike
ride
its
also
one
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
on
draft
i
wouldnt
recommend
seeking
it
out
but
if
you
run
across
a
bottle
and
like
berliner
weisse
id
give
it
a
shot
drinkability
was
amazing
i
was
astounded
by
how
much
flavor
could
be
packed
into
a
3
abv
beer
i
could
only
wish
this
style
would
become
americas
new
goto
summer
brew
this
beer
is
yellowishbrownish
color
with
a
few
centimeters
of
white
foam
the
aroma
is
new
leather
vinegar
fruit
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
light
airy
and
carbonated
the
flavors
are
sour
tart
fruity
its
dryness
becomes
apparent
through
the
center
and
it
finishes
bone
bone
dry
refreshing
and
appetizing
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
d
perfect
in
this
heat
i
could
throw
back
a
few
of
these
good
stuff
with
a
bit
of
fruit
syrup
wow
what
a
delight
this
beer
is
a
not
a
great
berliner
in
my
opinion
the
acidic
tartness
is
present
but
it
is
toned
down
to
the
point
where
much
of
the
wheat
beer
flavor
is
present
and
you
can
almost
taste
the
hops
this
makes
it
taste
closer
to
a
lager
than
a
wheat
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
looks
really
pretty
taste
isnt
bad
by
any
means
but
i
prefer
a
stronger
sour
taste
still
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
on
a
day
like
today
drinkability
great
summer
ale
and
good
for
its
purpose
d
an
easy
drinking
low
alcohol
beer
for
sure
summertime
in
lieu
of
lemonade
this
would
be
a
good
choice
though
its
considerably
more
expensive
than
the
better
hottenroth
berliner
style
weisse
is
highly
drinkable
but
it
was
definitely
not
worth
the
price
tag
and
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
i
am
not
sure
what
a
classic
example
of
the
style
should
taste
like
as
i
have
only
had
the
bruerys
hottenroth
to
compare
this
one
too
but
i
prefer
the
bruerys
version
much
more
than
this
one
brightly
citrus
and
lactic
flavors
not
as
sour
as
most
berlinerweisses
ive
sampled
lately
light
body
lots
of
carbonation
overall
its
pretty
good
but
ive
had
better
recently
d
this
is
a
very
light
beer
with
a
clean
lactic
sourness
being
the
defining
flavor
characteristic
somewhat
less
sour
than
i
expected
it
is
still
tart
and
refreshing
but
more
drinkable
than
other
examples
of
the
style
it
doesnt
need
the
syrup
that
berliner
weisse
is
often
served
with
11
2oz
bottle
served
in
a
tank
7
tulip
bottle
conditioned
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
with
two
fingers
plus
of
white
head
plenty
of
carbonation
tart
and
fruity
aroma
very
light
bodied
not
as
tart
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
but
it
becomes
more
so
as
it
warms
some
berry
flavors
fairly
refreshing
but
not
really
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
d
at
3
0
this
is
practically
alcohol
free
sampling
this
after
the
first
lawn
mowing
of
the
season
does
the
trick
as
a
thirst
quenching
post
work
drink
almost
by
definition
this
style
is
very
drinkable
and
this
is
no
exception
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
great
version
of
this
style
but
i
definitely
could
drink
this
all
day
long
this
can
be
a
very
refreshing
drink
especially
cold
and
at
3
abv
one
could
drink
a
lot
likely
a
drink
in
which
one
usually
mixes
syrup
not
a
go
to
or
food
beer
it
was
difficult
to
find
an
appropriate
score
for
drinkability
on
one
hand
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
has
almost
no
alcohol
so
it
would
be
easy
to
chug
it
all
day
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
which
made
me
actually
want
to
go
back
and
have
another
overall
id
say
this
beer
is
worth
a
look
if
you
like
this
style
found
this
little
11
2oz
baby
sitting
at
one
of
my
favorite
local
bottle
shops
being
one
never
to
shy
a
way
from
a
berliner
weiss
they
are
like
totally
awesome
i
dropped
the
3
29
and
put
it
in
the
sack
popped
the
cap
and
was
instantly
hit
with
a
mild
lactic
twang
along
with
uh
oh
wet
cardboard
this
beer
has
a
slight
oxidized
aroma
to
it
hopefully
it
wont
be
to
prevalent
in
its
makeup
there
also
is
a
slight
lemon
zest
and
grassy
hop
aroma
that
hides
the
slight
oxidization
the
flavor
profile
is
much
the
same
except
for
one
big
difference
the
infection
in
the
berliner
weiss
isnt
entirely
lactic
in
nature
there
is
definitely
something
else
in
there
it
reminds
me
of
sour
yogurt
pushing
on
the
tail
of
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
crisp
and
clean
as
most
berliner
weiss
but
as
a
berliner
style
weiss
i
cant
really
fault
it
this
isnt
my
favorite
berliner
that
ive
had
but
its
drinkable
drinkable
beer
but
not
that
great
d
fine
if
you
are
considering
it
a
summer
thirst
quencher
but
not
a
good
rendition
of
a
great
and
nearly
dead
beer
style
the
citizens
of
berlin
only
have
one
offering
in
a
city
that
consumed
over
a
million
hl
of
it
at
the
turn
of
the
19th
to
the
20th
centuries
a
shame
d
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
10
of
these
especially
considering
the
low
abv
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
one
again
i
might
have
a
few
sips
of
someone
elses
if
they
bought
a
bottle
just
to
revisit
the
bizarre
flavor
of
this
brew
but
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
want
to
venture
another
glass
drinkability
is
decent
a
good
starter
into
the
berliner
weiss
style
but
it
ends
up
flat
and
without
any
distinct
characteristics
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
best
suited
for
a
hot
summer
day
worth
a
shot
11
2oz

bready

with
some

taste
consistent

also
has
a
slight

a
mild
lemony

is
lightbodied
and
mildly
effervescent
with
a
kiss
of
citrus
astringency
at
the
the

ends
fairly
crisp
and
mostly
clean
except
for
some
residual
breadiness
only
my
second
berliner
weissbier
1809
being
my
first
and
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
it
interesting
but
im
not
loving
this
one
particularly
at
the
4
99
price
tag
it
has
the
color
of
a
witbier
washed
out
straw
color
slightly
hazy
and
a
tall
bubbled
head
stand
on
top
with
good
head
retention
the
aroma
is
sharp
its
like
smelling
raspberries
with
a
hint
of
cereals
tastes
like
the
aroma
as
well
slightly
tart
raspberries
are
the
dominant
flavor
with
a
touch
of
wheat
touching
down
on
the
palate
and
settling
into
the
aftertaste
make
no
mistake
though
there
is
some
sourness
here
lemon
creeps
into
the
overall
picture
more
flavor
emerges
as
i
go
along
very
light
bodied
but
not
watery
its
a
very
easy
brew
to
knock
down
but
if
you
plan
to
knock
down
a
few
be
aware
that
it
is
expensive
5
49
for
a
330
ml
bottle
drinkability
if
you
dont
mind
a
sour
beer
i
think
this
is
highly
drinkable
packs
plenty
of
flavor
for
a
low
alcohol
level
beer
certainly
a
new
experience
in
beer
for
me
id
been
interested
in
trying
a
berliner
weiss
for
some
time
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
giving
this
a
try
everything
is
improved
including
lacing
with
a
dash
of
sugar
and
raspberry
syrup
the
score
reflects
that
slightly
drinkability
the
taste
was
a
let
down
on
2
counts
it
never
got
to
the
level
of
the
nose
and
the
finish
put
me
off
and
pretty
much
spoiled
the
session
still
for
a
brew
this
low
in
abv
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
you
might
infer
from
my
comments
and
as
always
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
d
low
abv
and
not
offensive
easy
to
drink
enjoyed
with
velveeta
mac
and
cheese
for
some
reason
worked
well
a
good
beer
that
i
would
like
to
enjoy
again
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
a
pretty
good
beer
that
definately
favors
the
milder
end
of
the
styles
spectrum
very
fruity
and
less
challenging
than
most
clean
and
drinkable
very
refreshing
highly
recommended
especially
for
those
unaccustomed
to
this
unique
wonderful
style
cheers
overall
a
very
well
made
berliner
weisse
if
not
for
mild
flaws
in
the
taste
this
one
would
be
top
notch
very
traditionally
made
and
accurately
so
the
subtle
tartness
and
mouthfeel
are
fantastic
this
one
really
could
be
a
very
amazing
beer
if
they
can
just
get
that
damn
wierd
corny
taste
out
of
the
middle
a
good
beer
but
ill
grab
1809
over
this
one
nearly
every
time
33cl
bottle
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
billowing
white
head
that
eventually
recedes
to
leave
a
collar
smells
tart
with
citrus
character
as
well
as
notes
of
damp
hay
and
a
bit
of
honey
notes
reminiscent
of
grappa
tastes
of
lemon
and
grain
some
sourness
but
not
incredibly
strong
the
flavors
are
rather
weak
light
body
with
heavy
carbonation
very
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
summer
beer
but
not
a
great
berliner
weisse
drinkability
i
couldnt
even
finish
the
beer
also
such
a
low
abv
seems
like
it
will
be
good
for
people
who
love
lemons
but
not
suggested
for
most
very
nice
pour
with
a
nice
head
that
sits
and
eventually
ends
up
a
ring
on
the
glass
light
lace
color
of
light
yellow
murky
quite
light
and
not
murky
but
cloudy
even
smell
is
tart
and
a
mild
sweet
there
is
a
light
aspect
of
yogurt
and
this
carries
over
into
the
creamy
aspect
of
the
body
mild
sweet
wheat
malt
apricot
grass
predominant
tart
quality
apple
combining
into
a
fruit
acid
and
lactic
acid
that
give
the
sour
multiple
dimensions
excellent
drinkability
as
the
low
alcohol
complex
yet
sessionable
flavor
and
soft
mouthfeel
make
this
an
nice
summer
beer
for
beer
geeks
the
body
is
light
but
not
as
dry
as
would
have
liked
some
yeasty
leaves
a
chalky
off
aftertaste
in
the
finish
overall
a
decent
berliner
weisse
but
i
suppose
my
us
expectations
expects
a
bit
more
acidic
notes
very
interesting
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
pours
a
hazy
very
pale
yellow
color
1
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
wheat
sweet
malt
sourness
and
some
slight
fruit
fits
the
style
of
a
berliner
weissbier
mouth
feel
is
slightly
thick
with
high
carbonation
levels
and
high
level
of
sourness
very
sour
almost
burns
the
tongue
another
first
for
me
tastes
sour
first
then
the
sweet
malt
and
wheat
come
through
the
fruit
and
more
sourness
is
in
the
finish
wow
this
is
hard
to
describe
its
a
mix
between
sour
drop
candy
lemonade
and
a
decent
wheat
beer
i
agree
that
the
sour
level
is
too
much
and
that
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
since
this
is
the
desired
affect
though
they
nailed
it
as
far
as
i
can
tell
worth
a
try
if
just
to
sample
the
style
mouthfeel
is
crisply
but
softly
carbonated
very
light
bodied
d
highly
drinkable
for
pure
raw
apple
taste
this
blows
more
apple
flavororiented
brews
like
unibroue
ephemere
apple
out
of
the
water
d
a
very
good
drinker
very
easy
to
drink
and
have
several
as
it
is
low
in
alcohol
even
for
a
light
beer
it
packs
enough
interesting
flavor
to
make
it
a
good
choice
overall
interesting
nice
touch
with
the
sourness
but
not
quite
something
i
would
get
again
if
they
raised
the
abv
and
it
had
a
smooth
alcohol
burn
aftertaste
i
would
probably
get
it
again
very
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
very
pale
straw
color
with
about
2
fingers
of
pillowy
white
head
aroma
is
very
subdued
a
bit
of
wheat
some
lemon
and
a
distinct
although
not
terribly
potent
sourness
overall
it
was
a
bit
like
white
wine
taste
is
just
as
subdued
as
the
aroma
initially
there
is
a
very
dominant
sourness
but
after
the
first
sip
the
sourness
lessens
considerably
the
sourness
is
the
main
flavor
component
here
with
and
it
builds
into
the
finish
there
is
a
soft
wheat
flavor
that
supports
the
sourness
there
is
no
hop
presence
to
speak
of
whatsoever
and
no
is
expected
no
hop
flavor
no
hop
bitterness
the
sourness
that
was
so
strong
initially
returns
after
a
few
sips
and
is
quite
welcome
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
the
sourness
is
the
dominant
flavor
but
not
too
strong
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
that
i
really
did
enjoy
and
im
glad
that
i
was
able
to
give
it

refuse
to

with
a

dash
of

or
a

especially
a
straw
as
it
destroys
the
wonderful

maybe
its
because
my

is
lebanese

i
enjoy
a
pleasing

i
really

very

quite
acidic

also
very
drinkable

smooth
this
brew
was
very
empty
in
flavor
but
i
heard
that
berliner
weisses
were
supposed
to
be
the
most
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
could
see
it
drinkability
i
said
i
would
never
try
this
style
again
but
now
that
i
can
handle
sour
beers
i
appreciate
this
style
very
crisp
and
drinkable
a
most
unusual
beer
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
down
very
much
of
this
but
it
was
certainly
tolerable
and
interesting
to
sample
however
i
felt
like
i
needed
a
good
dopple
afterward
to
clean
and
refresh
my
palate
d
not
great
scores
but
this
is
a
refreshing
quaffable
little
beer
as
summer
draws
to
an
end
this
is
a
perfect
warm
day
quencher
ive
had
better
berliners
still
this
deserves
a
try

tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not

good
representation

this
is
a
very
mild
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
sourness
and
you
want
low
abv
this
is
quite
drinkable
i
do
enjoy

ounce

the
aroma
is
a
bit
malty
and
very
lemony
and
even
a
bit
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
pretty
carbonated
the
taste
is
very
lemony
tart
sour
and
refreshing
wow
this
is
what
they
should
be
selling
instead
of
that
cheladawine
coolerlikeshandymalternative
junk
this
is
the
real
deal
as
far
as
a
light
refreshing
well
made
beer
im
not
sure
its
really
to
style
its
not
as
intense
as
the
other
german
berliner
weisse
ive
tried
but
i
really
like
it
carbonation
is
actually
a
little
too
low
here
resulting
in
a
lessthanoptimal
palate
sticky
and
not
very
crisp
for
a
style
thats
intended
to
be
refreshing
body
is
as
thin
as
can
be
making
this
quite
drinkable
d
wish
i
didnt
give
the
other
one
away
tasty
and
very
refreshing
i
would
have
liked
a
little
bit
more
sourness
but
thats
just
me
drinkability
after
a
while
this
beer
grew
on
me
and
i
enjoyed
the
light
but
complex
flavors
refreshing
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
or
had
anticipated
a
huge
head
of
bright
white
foam
rises
up
as
you
pour
it
beneath
a
hazy
whitishgold
body
releases
delicate
pinpoint
bubbles
the
nose
is
a
touch
grainy
wheatish
yeasty
and
even
subtly
sweet
its
subdued
as
is
the
flavor
again
its
got
some
grainy
malt
and
yeast
character
but
its
also
veiled
in
a
thin
tartness
its
far
from
mouthpuckering
and
overall
this
is
a
very
restrained
version
of
the
style
that
however
leaves
it
imminently
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
its
low
alcohol
content
and
tartness
its
almost
like
a
lemon
seltzer
perfect
for
summer
edit
i
must
brew
this
the
ultimate
lawnmower
beer
no
need
for
gatorade
with
this
one
no
doubt
an
all
day
enjoyable
brew
as
long
as
its
hot
d
very
light
you
could
drink
a
ton
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
are
more
suited
for
such
notes
got
this
one
from
dyan
thanks
im
starting
to
really
like
this
style
of
beer
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
b
b
b
g
g
co
have
created
a
kinder
gentler
version
of
this
classic
style
its
much
more
enjoyable
and
infinitely
more
drinkable
this
way
syrups

poured
at

port
bottle
shop
into
a
snifter
glass
poured
a
pale
clear
straw
color
with
a
little
white
head
smell
is
dominated
by
wheat
citrus
and
a
slight
sour
lactic
scent
taste
is
lemon
citrus
with
a
little
sour
flavor
but
not
much
and
a
semi
dry
finish
very
light
body
beer
bodering
on
the
lightness
of
water
with
a
moderate
to
low
carbonation
this
is
my
second
berliner
weissbier
and
while
not
as
good
to
me
as
the
1809
ilike
the
sourness
and
funk
of
that
beer
its
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
none
the
less
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
style
thats
for
sure
poured
into
my
cup
and
received
a
very
light
gold
could
see
through
it
clearly
when
held
to
light
body
with
minimal
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
little
lacings
a
mild
citrus
smell
with
some
hops
and
yeast
in
it
a
sour
taste
a
little
too
sour
for
my
liking
the
sourness
overrode
the
wheat
coming
and
ruined
some
of
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
there
was
no
backbite
to
me
because
of
the
sourness
when
first
hit
on
the
tongue
still
a
somewhat
flavorful
brew
that
with
some
citrus
and
wheat
that
was
noticeable
and
it
did
go
down
alright
at
3
i
wouldnt
session
this
though
too
weak
just
not
my
style
i
guess
and
mine
is
much
more
sour
11
2oz
bottle
pours
a
pale
and
cloudy
whitish
yellow
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sour
with
wheat
and
yeast
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
like
the
aroma
is
a
bit
tart
with
some
wheat
and
yeast
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
thin
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
it
is
nothing
special
but
would
be
nice
and
refreshing
and
would
be
a
pretty
nice
session
brew
on
a
hot
day
edit
i
added
the
yeast
after
finishing
about
34
of
the
beer
doing
so
let
the
yeast
some
through
in
the
nose
rounded
the
mouthfeel
out
but
also
got
rid
of
some
of
the
nice
clean
sourness
id
recommend
trying
it
both
ways
to
see
which
you
prefer
i
have
had
other
berliners
and
this
one
is
pretty
true
to
form
overall
a
delicious
soured
slightly
wheaty
beer
d
the
unusually
low
alcohol
in
no
way
distracts
or
hinders
from
flavor
or
enjoyability
as
this
is
a
prime
example
per
style
and
goes
down
nicely
from
the
smooth
sourness
i
really
like
this
its
very
very
drinkable
and
at
3
0
i
could
down
a
6er
of
these
way
too
easily
on
a
summer
day
id
like
to
try
one
with
syrup
as
is
traditional
with
berliner
weisse
i
tried
this
one
with
and
without
the
yeast
and
while
the
difference
is
subtle
i
prefer
mine
without
it
tended
to
add
a
little
bitterness
poured
out
a
very
light
straw
color
very
foamy
head
this
beer
is
actually
pretty
nice
to
look
at
lemony
on
the
nose
strawyeastthis
may
sound
funny
but
i
am
a
country
boy
and
this
beer
smells
just
liked
freshly
shucked
sweet
corn
light
yeast
lacing
now
that
beer
is
poured
out
very
tart
lemony
flavor
very
light
nice
aperitif
clean
mouthfeel
i
like
it
oelergud
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
the
smell
is
of
wheat
malt
and
lemony
citrus
the
taste
is
very
light
kind
of
like
lemon
seltzer
a
slight
malt
base
to
distinguish
this
beer
from
water
the
feel
is
light
and
moderately
fizzy
finishes
very
neutral
almost
water
like
im
not
an
expert
on
this
style
but
knowing
what
it
should
be
i
would
have
to
say
this
doesnt
hit
the
mark
it
is
barely
tart
or
sour
and
adding
any
sweet
syrup
to
this
brew
would
make
it
grossly
over
balanced
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
the
beer
was
moderately
carbonated
a
slight
sweetness
on
the
front
palate
that
was
follow
by
a
refreshing
tartness
on
the
mid
to
back
palate
reminds
me
of
pink
grapefruit
reminisent
of
a
flemish
sour
or
in
the
wine
world
a
sauvignon
blanc
d
this
is
a
very
good
example
flavorful
low
abv
3
very
sessionable
and
refreshing
i
could
probably
drink
this
often
and
not
get
bored
a
slightly
lighter
version
of
the
style
than
i
am
used
to
but
stands
up
just
fine
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
however
there
are
more
unique
berliner
weisses
out
there
if
you
like
the
style
you
should
give
this
a
try
but
if
you
want
better
versions
you
should
try
weihenstephaners
1809
or
the
dfh
festiva
peche
both
of
which
are
fuller
in
body
and
character
still
this
one
is
nice
and
certainly
refreshing
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
like
today
and
at
3
abv
its
something
you
can
enjoy
all
afternoon
ohhh
based
on
another
reviewers
comments
i
tried
adding
some
woodruff
and
i
have
to
say
the
beer
improves
dramatically
still
not
the
best
of
the
style
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
id
bump
the
taste
up
to
a
solid
three
with
the
woodruff
easy
to
drink
and
very
thrist
quenching
this
beer
is
at
the
light
end
of
the
spectrum
for
the
style
but
still
maintains
the
most
important
characteristics
definitely
one
to
try
for
berliner
fans
this
is
the
palest
beer
ive
ever
had
i
believe
somewhere
between
clear
and
very
pale
golden
very
slightly
hazy
with
an
initial
head
that
fades
completely
the
smell
has
faint
lemon
and
grassiness
the
taste
is
similar
very
very
lightlemon
and
a
hint
of
grassiness
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
soft
and
the
body
is
very
light
somewhat
drinkable
but
so
light
and
with
a
washed
out
citrus
taste
that
is
somewhat
distracting
this
is
a
nothing
beer
and
dissappointingly
soft
for
a
berliner
weisse
i
like
way
more
zing
in
the
style
donteven
think
of
adding
syrup
to
this
one
it
would
overwhelm
what
little
flavor
the
beer
has
completely
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
berliner
im
surprised
by
the
dryness
of
the
body
it
gives
the
impression
of
a
sour
champagne
the
brett
and
the
yeast
are
definitely
more
present
in
the
nose
than
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
sourbut
its
pretty
simple
rather
than
complex
im
definately
looking
for
more
wheat
characteristics
in
a
berliner
too
o
dthe
nose
was
shy
but
the
flavor
really
crazy
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
a
ton
of
flavor
at
3
what
a
cool
beer
o
as
someone
who
really
enjoys
this
style
and
sourness
to
a
beer
in
general
i
am
impressed
with
the
amount
of
flavors
packed
into
this
beer
considering
the
low
abv
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
a
day
so
refreshing
overall
lots
of
mouth
puckering
sour
flavour
going
on
but
it
still
remains
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
even
its
a
little
one
dimensional
taste
wise
but
still
a
solid
beer
lightly
hazed
pale
blonde
one
finger
of
white
head
that
went
to
nothing
in
seconds
no
lace
at
all
smell
is
full
on
funk
brett
fruity
lemons
acidic
and
almost
lambic
like
on
the
nose
seriously
funky
stuff
taste
is
funky
and
very
tart
apple
lemon
and
other
fruits
as
well
some
brett
mustiness
acidic
and
sour
with
a
suprisingly
bready
malt
aftertaste
high
carbonation
dry
and
lightly
syrupy
i
had
no
idea
how
good
this
was
going
to
be
had
no
idea
what
this
even
was
at
first
really
impresive
stuff
here
o
this
is
a
quality
berliner
im
not
sure
i
picked
up
a
lot
of
brett
funk
in
the
flavor
but
i
didnt
have
the
base
beer
to
compare
as
a
side
note
before
the
last
quarter
of
the
glass
i
added
a
small
amount
of
the
green
syrup
to
compare
the
sweetness
completely
hid
the
sour
and
tart
aspects
of
the
beer
which
to
me
ruined
the
appeal
of
the
brew
i
would
not
add
the
syrup
again
but
it
was
an
interesting
service
per
the
bartender
it
is
served
that
way
in
germany
to
make
the
sour
beer
more
appealing
to
children
oh
yes
gimme
gimme
that
brett
nice
funky
tones
but
mild
ones
some
banana
wrapped
up
in
there
super
smooth
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
nice
berliner
weisse
too
bad
we
cant
have
more
of
them
like
this
or
just
more
of
them
period
bottle
poured
a
hazy
pale
yellow
ale
with
a
large
pure
white
bubbly
head
with
strong
carbonation
but
not
much
retention
or
lacing
aroma
of
funky
barnyard
notes
and
sour
notes
are
more
dominant
then
expected
taste
is
a
complex
mix
between
loads
of
brett
with
some
tart
and
sour
notes
with
a
dry
finish
body
is
about
average
with
strong
carbonation
interesting
though
maybe
a
tad
too
sour
to
be
an
everyday
type
of
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
very
tasty
drinkable
berliner
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
see
it
o
probably
the
best
commercial
berliner
ive
tried
since
the
brett
was
so
prominent
im
pretty
sure
this
has
a
bit
of
age
on
it
not
as
drinkable
as
others
of
the
style
though
due
to
the
intense
sourness
i
remember
having
this
backtoback
with
the
unbretted
version
but
i
never
got
around
to
getting
my
thoughts
together
here
we
go
arectifyin
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
rind
wheat
light
brett
and
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
light
but
distinct
cut
of
tart
lemon
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bweiss
one
that
seems
helped
a
touch
by
the
brett
addition
this
is
quite
simply
an
enjoyable
beer
which
i
think
is
accessible
even
to
those
who
dont
much
care
for
the
style
case
in
point
is
my
wife
who
doesnt
generally
like
sours
but
enjoyed
this
one
thoroughly
drink
this
was
all
over
the
place
with
its
individual
parts
all
that
mattered
is
that
it
tastes
good
probably
would
want
a
bottle
but
wont
actively
seek
it
out
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
berliner
not
super
sour
or
anything
but
the
taste
has
some
light
sourness
and
funk
to
it
which
i
liked
a
lot
worth
checking
out
and
i
would
have
it
again
incredibly
pale
yellow
color
with
a
huge
white
head
the
nose
is
very
light
and
lactic
lemon
peel
straw
and
a
light
funkiness
very
minimal
malt
or
wheat
aromas
the
flavor
is
somehow
even
lighter
very
spritzy
light
lemon
peel
a
touch
of
grass
and
the
lightest
flavors
of
wheat
just
a
hint
of
tartness
on
the
finish
berliner
weisses
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
although
this
example
was
quaffable
and
refreshing
it
could
have
benefitted
from
more
complexity
d
very
drinkable
powerfully
funky
and
tart
but
extremely
tasty
really
nice
complexity
o
i
was
a
bit
weary
based
on
the
look
and
smell
of
this
beer
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
just
spot
on
and
thats
far
more
important
to
me
this
is
a
perfect
late
springearly
summer
beer
refreshing
but
still
complex
and
interesting
plus
at
3
you
can
drink
in
the
summer
heat
without
worrying
too
much
about
getting
wasted
or
dehydrated
im
definitely
going
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
of
these
while
i
can
on
tap
at
blue
monk
a
good
tartness
akin
to
an
unsweetened
lemonade
with
a
little
brett
and
i
believe
malt
to
make
it
drinkable
very
good
drinkability
suitable
carbonation
yellow
body
with
a
small
white
head
a
good
representation
of
what
is
often
a
yummy
style
this
beer
is
perfect
for
almost
everybody
a
must
buy
if
you
see
it
a
pleasant
surprise
ive
been
on
a
big
berliner
weiss
kick
lately
and
this
has
easily
been
the
best
i
have
had
the
addition
of
brett
and
the
amount
of
tartness
present
here
just
cannot
be
beat
awesome
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
bash
this
one
for
being
overly
sour
as
it
is
a
berliner
weisse
i
just
wish
is
held
on
to
the
hint
of
malt
that
you
get
just
before
the
finish
pear
juice
like
colour
murky
yellow
with
a
real
transient
head
no
retention
or
lacing
as
expected
nose
is
super
lactic
lemon
weird
funk
notes
maybe
some
urine
and
wheat
taste
has
a
shredding
lactic
sourness
wheat
and
paler
malt
character
mild
lemon
a
really
ripping
tartness
within
the
style
not
on
the
level
of
some
lambics
however
that
takes
a
bit
of
time
to
acclimatize
to
some
green
apple
skins
as
well
light
watery
body
and
a
puckering
lingering
drying
mouthfeel
a
solid
berliner
refreshing
if
often
overpowering
would
love
to
try
this
with
some
syrups
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
head
nose
is
sour
lemons
with
a
bit
of
bretty
funk
taste
is
sharp
sour
lemons
up
front
that
move
to
a
bit
of
a
funkiness
then
a
lot
more
sourness
really
nice
berliner
spritzy
carbonation
leaves
a
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
berliner
best
i
have
had
to
date
highly
recommended
overall
a
great
refreshing
beer
brett
angle
hits
on
the
nose
but
is
sort
of
lost
after
repeated
sips
no
complaints
still
solid
and
quite
a
fun
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
straw

another

from

overall
great
beer
for
this
sunny

light
refrshing
and
delicious
pours
a

slowly
fades
away
to
nothing
pleasant
funky

lactic
nose

light

with

slightly
grassy

and
a
pleasant

medium

with

dry

note
do
not
drink
an
entire
growler
of
this
beer
in
a
oneday
session
you
will
regret
it
based
on
the
ph
imbalance
in
your
stomach
you
have
been
warned
o
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
going
into
this
beer
i
did
not
think
that
so
much
flavor
and
tartness
could
be
packed
in
such
a
low
abv
beer
simply
wonderful
this
is
really
tasty
nice
blend
of
malt
and
yeast
flavor
overall
a
fantastic
berliner
weis
i
am
iso
more
of
this
for
sure
this
is
delicious
crisp
tart
and
wonderfully
refreshing
as
mentioned
above
id
like
the
carbonation
to
be
a
bit
lower
and
the
sourness
in
the
flavor
to
be
more
balanced
but
all
around
a
very
nice
berliner
weiss
the
cpj
i
would
pay
a
shitton
to
buy
4
or
6
packs
of
this
it
would
rival
snpa
as
my
go
to
beer
in
the
summer
i
think
i
like
it
more
than
even
hottenroth
gasp
o
really
tasty
probably
my
favorite
example
of
this
style
that
ive
come
across
all
in
all
if
this
was
not
5
beans
a
bottle
this
would
be
an
all
day
beer
the
yeast
works
wonders
to
an
average
beer
and
takes
it
there
easy
to
gulp
down
and
it
wont
get
you
drunk
had
this
on
tap
fresh
when
it
hit
the
docks
and
i
enjoyed
this
semi
aged
bottle
a
bit
better
taste
starts
out
with
a
sour
tartness
on
the
tongue
makes
you
pucker
a
bit
but
isnt
overwhelming
brett
funk
seeps
in
on
the
aftertaste
finishes
dry
and
clean
carbonation
is
a
touch
high
but
is
expected
with
a
thin
body
quite
refreshing
pours
a
hazy
bright
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
very
tart
almost
like
a
wild
but
with
some
more
regular
light
german
beer
flavor
lingering
in
the
background
taste
is
very
light
and
tart
very
refreshing
almost
like
a
cross
between
beer
and
lemonade
but
not
in
the
terrible
way
that
combination
actually
tastes
mouthfeel
is
very
lightbodied
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
really
fantastic
basically
a
perfect
berliner
a
great
beer
very
nice
overall
if
you
like
tart
easy
drinking
beers
this
one
is
a
winner

all

aroma
first
sip
is

obviously
lactic
acid
that
coats

and
doesnt
linger
too
long
aftertaste
is
distinct
cherry
pie
brettanomyces
lambicus
flavor
tartness
is
just
a
bit
more
that
normal
for
a
berlinerweizen
lactobacillus
doesnt
get
lost
though
wheat
body
is
depleted
in
fermentation
thin
and
dry
as
expected
but
the
wheat
flavor
isnt
lost
this
beer
holds
up
amazingly
for
a
3er
kind
of
a
tooth
melter
my
teeth
hurt
after
drinking
this
one
but
very
worth
while
this
beer
kicks
ass
this
is
my
first
sampling
of
this
style
so
i
may
be
way
off
the
mark
on
this
review
it
was
pretty
good
but
not
very
complex
to
me
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
almost
like
an
american
unfiltered
wheat
with
tons
of
lem
juice
in
it
o
a
very
good
berliner
weisse
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
if
i
were
to
find
it
locally
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
definitely
one
to
give
a
try
this
is
a
really
good
berliner
one
of
the
better
i
have
ever
had
at
3
more
please
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
no
lacing
the
smell
is
just
sour
with
some
grassy
notes
maybe
a
little
grain
the
taste
is
clean
and
sour
and
crisp
though
a
tad
yeasty
with
a
sharp
mineral
edge
to
it
obviously
some
nice
water
its
thin
and
bright
in
the
mouth
with
a
little
slickness
from
the
yeast
a
delicious
and
drinkable
beer
thanks
to
mandark
for
this
one
overall
this
was
a
really
solid
example
of
the
style
and
quite
flavorful
for
such
a
low
abv
offering
really
nothing
amazing
about
it
though
maybe
it
is
just
the
style
for
me
i
appreciated
tasting
it
but
have
no
need
to
again
anytime
soon
o
absolutely
amazing
i
would
drink
this
every
day
if
given
the
opportunity
dont
miss
it
if
you
spot
it
in
a
bottle
store
overall
i
didnt
read
any
reviews
on
this
prior
to
trying
so
i
was
expecting
funk
and
a
touch
of
sour
but
no
this
is
probably
the
sourest
of
sours
ive
had
its
mouth
puckering
and
i
actually
teared
up
nothing
complex
about
it
but
a
must
try
if
you
like
intense
sours
o
a
truly
great
beer
pricey
but
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
o
light
refreshing
and
fizzy
with
a
sour
twist
delicious
could
drink
this
all
day
o
a
very
good
berliner
weisse
very
dry
with
a
good
amount
of
tart
flavor
mixed
with
wheat
and
citrus
o
it
was
refreshing
and
easy
to
get
down
but
i
felt
that
it
was
a
bit
onenoted
as
the
tartness
dominated
all
other
flavors
in
the
taste
i
think
with
a
bit
more
age
there
will
be
a
better
balance
o
unique
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
not
something
id
crave
often
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
o
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
d
an
amazing
sour
berliner
weisse
that
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
very
drinkable
yet
i
want
to
sip
smaller
and
smaller
sips
as
the
glass
empties
extremely
tasty
and
tart
and
an
excellent
little
sour
beer
im
going
back
to
the
beer
store
i
saw
these
at
in
sc
to
clean
them
out
tomorrow
fantastic
this
beer
smells
lovely
very
funky
and
fruity
the
taste
is
very
dry
and
tart
with
a
definite
brett
character
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
o
great
berliner
weisse
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
had
this
on
tap
and
was
amazed
and
its
still
just
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
if
looking
for
a
sour
forward
berliner
weisse
this
is
perfect
o
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
it
was
the
highlight
of
a
night
that
included
brews
such
as
black
tuesday
and
sour
in
the
rye
and
this
one
is
only
3
i
still
cant
beleive
that
pick
this
one
up
if
you
can
hazy
white
gold
with
a
white
head
that
pops
and
fizzes
nose
is
the
amazing
and
beautiful
pineapple
upsidedown
cake
scent
that
comes
from
the
mix
of
wheat
and
brett
lambicus
taste
is
tart
mildly
sweet
preserved
lemon
on
pineapple
upsidedown
awesome
touch
of
flint
mineralwell
stone
in
the
back
end
lemonade
like
body
i
love
love
love
this
version
more
please
overall
i
am
not
sure
i
have
mentioned
that
this
is
tart
oh
and
this
is
3
abv
impressive
o
this
beer
is
intense
a
little
overwhelming
at
first
but
the
more
you
get
into
it
the
better
it
gets
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
will
be
nice
to
pick
up
from
time
to
time
ill
be
back
for
more
this
a
delicious
sour
wheat
beer
given
the
intensity
of
the
carbonation
some
people
may
be
put
off
but
to
pack
that
much
flavor
into
a
beer
with
3abv
is
truly
the
work
of
an
skilled
brewmaster
thanks
matthias
keep
sending
your
leipzig
sour
beers
to
the
united
states
and
they
will
find
their
way
into
my
glass
a
good
one
overall
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
a
very
nice
find
o
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
really
enjoyed
the
initial
intense
sourness
followed
by
the
normal
wheat
qualities
really
enjoyable
beer
the
finest
berliner
i
have
tried
get
it
if
you
see
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
one
of
my
favorite
beers
mouthpuckeringly
sour
refreshing
as
hell
and
packed
full
as
flavor
for
something
at
3
the
light
fruit
flavors
combine
well
with
the
wheat
and
grass
creating
a
citrus
and
grain
sour
bomb
while
more
intense
than
your
average
berliner
style
weiss
its
still
the
peak
of
the
style
phenomenal
a
delicious
sour
german
wheat
beer
with
a
plethera
of
complexity
packed
into
a
3
beer
more
of
these
beers
are
welcome
in
my
glass
overall
very
easy
to
drink
tart
and
refreshing
i
could
literally
drink
this
all
night
long
yummm
this
is
an
absolute
treat
great
stuff
overall
nice
super
sour
move
fruits
and
malts
great
display
of
the
lambicus
wild
yeast
without
anything
else
really
stepping
in
but
seems
to
lack
much
profile
other
than
the
sour
fruit
o
i
dig
it
but
not
more
than
the
classic
o
the
aroma
was
a
bit
hard
to
get
past
and
made
me
not
want
to
drink
this
but
im
glad
i
did
nice
use
of
brett
and
it
works
very
well
in
this
wheat
beer
flavors
really
pop
in
this
one
and
the
crispness
of
this
drink
from
all
of
the
carbonation
help
make
it
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
overall
the
beer
let
out
a
loud
hiss
when
i
popped
the
cap
as
if
it
were
going
to
gush
all
over
the
place
no
problems
though
maybe
ive
just
not
acquired
a
nose
for
this
one
yet
but
the
aroma
is
the
second
favorite
quality
i
enjoy
in
any
beer
after
taste
of
course
while
this
beer
rocked
in
every
other
category
i
just
couldnt
get
into
the
smell
of
it
aside
from
smell
this
one
has
everything
i
could
ask
for
in
a
berliner
weisse
holy
bootsy
collins
greg
this
ones
got
the
funk
o
an
amazingly
complex
take
on
one
of
my
favorite
oddball
styles
its
ridiculous
how
much
flavor
is
coaxed
out
of
a
3
abv
beer
thanks
to
sean
for
this
light
cloudy
gold
nice
head
that
forms
quickly
and
stays
a
while
nice
lacing
a
light
sourness
with
some
wheat
and
a
hint
of
grape
skins
taste
is
light
sour
yummy
totally
drinkable
nice
moutfeel
and
super
easy
to
drink
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
a
hot
day
aroma
is
light
sour
and
acidic
tartness
green
apples
with
a
mix
of
light
hay
and
sour
grapes
simply
remarkable
as
it
warms
the
crisp
and
clean
sour
flavor
really
starts
to
come
through
quite
nicely
as
the
light
nature
of
it
really
becomes
apparent
as
you
take
the
first
sip
remarkable
that
this
much
flavor
is
coming
through
crisp
clean
refreshing
and
light
the
nature
of
this
throws
me
for
a
loop
as
if
it
simply
could
not
get
any
better
crisp
green
apples
dominate
the
flavor
with
a
light
grassy
note
coming
in
the
finish
along
with
an
amazing
dryness
o
very
refreshing
i
wouldve
liked
a
bit
more
tartsour
but
this
was
quite
enjoyable
light
yellow
with
a
a
dense
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
this
looks
good
the
nose
is
super
stinky
and
farty
mildly
shitty
with
time
this
is
fruity
tart
and
mildly
vinous
and
very
lactic
still
this
is
extremely
sulfury
the
palate
opens
with
a
clean
lactic
sourness
tart
and
low
level
of
funk
sulfur
is
moderate
on
the
palate
lingering
on
the
finish
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
this
is
decent
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
tight
carbonation
up
front
and
a
tart
funky
bret
presence
that
lingers
throughout
into
a
lingering
dry
finish
although
its
dry
and
funky
its
still
light
crisp
and
refreshing
very
tart
and
dry
without
being
too
acidic
underneath
the
dry
funky
bret
there
are
hints
of
earthy
grass
and
straw
as
well
as
some
spicy
clove
banana
and
lemon
juice
its
pretty
tart
but
not
as
unpleasantly
funky
as
the
aroma
suggests
decently
balanced
and
once
you
get
over
the
initial
palate
shock
its
pretty
refreshing
and
quaffable
im
so
glad
this
masterpiece
made
its
way
to
philly
its
certainly
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
and
the
addition
of
brettanomyces
adds
a
new
dimension
without
overshadowing
the
masterful

the

tart
citric
and
altogether
enticing
the
beer
is
teeming
with
flavor
and
at
a
mere
3
abv
quite
impressive
the
feel
is
thin
and
watery
on
the
palate
in
a
pleasant
and
refreshing
way
the
flavor
also
brings
forth
the
tantalizing
tart
citrus
and
funky
brettanomyces
found
in
the
aroma
this
would
be
an
ideal
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
wish
i
had
a
keg
of
it
at
home
really
hazy

pretty
overcarbed
with
big
bubbles
wet

brett

some

and
a

the

suggests

but
the
flavor
is
predominantly
sour
and
tart
very
quenching
and
refreshing
flavor
of
lemons
wheat
and
sharp
lactic
sourness
kind
of
thin
and
really
carbed
a
great
refresher
for
the

superbly
executed

to

not
overpowering
i
am
picking
up
some
wet

in

enjoying
the
taste
quite
a
bit
tart
refreshing
like
fresca
for
a

geek
nice
and

i
think
this
would
be
a
nice

between

i
guess
you
could
call
this
a
nice
piece
of
cheese
thanks
to
7ways
for
throwing
this
in
the
box
beer
is
wet
and
thin
easy
drinking
i
could
kill
a
keg
of
this
in
a
single
day
its
like
tart
grainy
water
super
refreshing
im
dinging
it
on
the
score
because
the
brett
l
character
is
a
little
muddled
i
think
this
beer
should
be
aged
on
unroasted
oak
to
improve
the
back
flavors
with
more
tannic
flavors
on
the
finish
ive
got
one
more
of
these
and
ill
drink
it
soon
too
squat
bottle
poured

in

loads
of

serious
amounts
that
dissipate
quickly
and
transition
to
nice
lacing
color
is
very
nice
cloudy
golden
the
nose
is
mostly
sour
peach
flavor
is
slightly
sour
with
loads
of
peach
and
melon
overall
the
flavor
is
not
overpowering
and
lends
itself
to
food
high
carbonation
and
light
flavor
adds
to
the
drinkability
o
an
improvement
over
the
original
but
maybe
a
bit
too
intense
im
not
sure
im
terribly
qualified
to
judge
perfectly
to
the
style
as
ive
had
only
a
few
examples
but
this
is
good
and
will
teach
you
all
about
bretts
various
characteristics
because
there
isnt
too
much
else
distracting
from
it
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
just
wish
it
tasted
a
little
more
like
it
smelled
as
there
was
a
pronounced
dropoff
in
complexity
and
intensity

character
tart
and
crisp
nearly
watery
seemingly
less
complex
than
the
bottled
version
would
put
it
behind
1809
in
overall
scores
but
leaving
bottle
scores
unchanged
here
overall
a
really
delightful
light
and
enjoyable
beer
for
sour
lovers
d
very
enjoyable
and
so
easy
to
drink
its
such
a
perfect
summer
time
brew
ultra
chugable
but
something
you
want
to
enjoy
recommend
the
beer
tastes
quite
dry
which
is
accentuated
by
a
lactic
acid
tartness
the
fact
that
it
is
so
light
bodied
and
that
it
has
a
spritzy
carbonation
all
in
all
this
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
brew
somehow
this
seems
milky
i
am
not
sure
why
but
it
seems
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
lactic
acidity
this
really
doesnt
seem
any
different
than
the
regular
version
of
this
beer
to
me
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
bright
straw
yellow
in
color
with
a
massive
three
finger
self
destructing
very
fluffy
white
head
it
took
about
three
minutes
to
diminish
to
a
root
beer
float
like
poof
it
essentially
looks
like
pale
pear
juice
it
has
the
nice
dry
crisp
sour
notes
with
granny
smith
apple
like
aromas
mixed
with
some
strange
funk
the
funk
is
just
strange
its
as
if
the
brett
hasnt
found
its
place
the
flavors
arent
as
numerous
as
the
aromas
the
flavor
is
pretty
light
and
instantly
a
watery
tart
apple
it
kind
of
refoams
in
your
mouth
and
goes
down
like
youre
drinking
foam
its
just
a
little
strange
this
beer
was
ok
but
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
the
porticus
the
brett
took
away
from
what
i
really
appreciate
in
a
berliner
weiss
the
body
is
very
light
with
an
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
it
truly
is
impressive
the
amount
of
flavors
a
skilled
brewer
can
pack
into
such
a
small
beer
i
challenge
anyone
who
thinks
a
beer
with
less
than
5
abv
cant
be
packed
with
flavor
to
try
this
beer
its
just
so
delicious
easy
drinking
and
just
an
overall
pleasant
experience
and
the
best
part
is
i
can
have
3
or
4
or
5
and
hardly
feel
a
buzz
o
this
brew
is
tits
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
to
date
ill
be
having
a
few
of
these
philly
is
the
best
beer
town
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
that
is
a
little
thicker
in
the
feel
for
the
typical
berliner
weisse
pushing
medium
bodied
possibly
due
to
the
extra
yeast
in
suspension
making
it
feel
creamier
it
has
an
excessively
aggressive
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
a
touch
too
much
even
for
this
style
which
is
expected
to
be
lively
it
is
tart
enough
that
it
creates
the
minor
puckering
quality
that
yogurt
has
as
it
seeming
strips
the
moisture
out
of
your
mouth
it
finishes
crisp
and
refreshing
this
style
is
the
epitome
of
summertime
refreshment
and
this
offeringtake
on
the
style
is
awesome
drinkable
as
all
hell
i
actually
had
to
open
a
second
bottle
just
to
finish
the
review
because
i
had
the
first
glass
gone
before
i
even
wrote
anything
about
the
taste
this
lambicus
example
offers
a
unique
opportunity
to
experience
the
different
types
of
brettanomyces
instead
of
the
typical
funked
horsey
barnyard
notes
this
type
of
brett
offers
up
more
of
a
unique
sourness
with
light
fruit
notes
that
provide
an
awesome
addition
to
this
style
of
brew
well
done
it
was
my
intension
to
drink
and
share
a
couple
of
these
before
setting
some
in
the
cellar
to
try
and
forget
about
to
see
how
the
brett
further
developes
that
obviously
isnt
going
to
happen
now
i
like
this
beer
too
much
and
its
not
going
to
last
long
i
need
to
get
some
more
of
these
very
drinkable
i
could
have
this
all
night
a
delicious
refreshing
beer
i
think
this
would
be
amazing
after
a
hot
day
mowing
the
lawn
even
overall
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
beer
after
enjoying
the
nonbrett
version
however
the
brett
didnt
meld
as
much
as
id
hoped
an
interesting
beer
but
one
i
wouldnt
seek
out
again
if
only
this
stuff
was
mass
bottled
and
sold
for
a
cheap
price
it
would
utterly
destroy
bud
light
overall
a
good
berliner
weisse
but
southampton
still
is
the
gold
standard
for
me
just
not
enough
lactic
sourness
for
me
also
was
missing
some
distinctive
flavors
of
apples
lemons
etc
that
i
so
much
enjoyed
in
shs
version
regardless
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
berliner
fan
d
pretty
good
but
wish
it
was
more
funky
tasting
and
more
sour
cheers
d
ahhh
very
good
d
an
interesting
brew
and
very
drinkable
d
im
starting
to
believe
berlinerweisse
might
be
the
most
drinkable
style
out
there
well
worth
the
5
99
price
for
a
12
oz
bottle
d
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
the
funk
of
the
brettanomyces
is
enough
to
highlight
the
nice
lactic
tang
of
the
beer
without
getting
in
the
way
d
the
aroma
is
really
quite
over
the
top
with
a
funk
character
that
borders
on
foul
fortunately
the
flavor
is
much
more
pleasant
and
surprisingly
restrianed
the
acidity
is
much
milder
than
i
expected
based
on
the
aroma
and
despite
is
champagne
like
character
is
maintains
a
certain
creamy
malt
quality
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
the
beer
is
gone
very
drinkable
and
quite
an
interesting
take
on
the
historical
possibilities
of
this
beer
scored
a
six
pack
of
bombers
from
a
friend
that
aged
them
for
2
years
drink
by
date
of
912
because
he
didnt
like
them
but
didnt
want
to
throw
them
away
needless
to
say
this
beer
has
aged
very
well
poured
from
650
ml
bomber
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
o
this
bottle
is
over
a
year
old
but
ive
heard
of
berliners
lasting
up
to
a
couple
of
years
at
least
the
ones
that
actually
use
brett
this
did
not
hold
up
but
even
still
i
doubt
it
was
very
good
in
the
first
place
not
tart
enough
and
seriously
lacking
substance
all
around
atmosphere
is
okay
no
real
head
or
lacing
nose
is
light
tropical
fruit
and
bread
yeasty
with
a
little
tart
and
sweet
fruit
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
i
like
this
beer
i
see
why
it
might
be
a
summer
style
i
find
it
refreshing
and
good
where
to
start
the
malt
seems
a
little
too
biscuity
and
not
crisp
enough
and
the
beer
flavors
in
the
background
are
quite
watery
not
nearly
sour
enough
either
just
a
light
lemon
squeeze
is
all
i
am
getting
its
more
like
an
unsweetened
radler
and
less
like
a
berliner
ill
easily
finish
my
bomber
but
even
at
the
modest
price
of
5
i
wont
be
going
back
for
more
a
shame
too
because
i
would
loooove
to
have
an
affordable
decently
sour
berliner
available
here
c
fruity
smell
fizzy
tart
finish
pretty
crisp
for
sure
not
sure
what
occasion
this
seasonal
beer
is
for
a
wedding
new
years
i
am
sure
this
one
has
a
cult
following
but
i
am
far
away
for
sure
think
champagne
gone
bad
or
some
incomplete
cider
i
would
pour
it
for
friends
just
for
fun
to
see
their
reaction
tart
and
slightly
woody
plenty
of
suds
as
you
sip
quite
drinkable
but
not
much
complexity
i
have
to
admit
that
it
does
seem
to
suggest
adding
something
fruity
and
flavorful
or
maybe
mix
it
5050
with
a
saison
that
needs
some
spritz
or
a
hefeweizen
thats
on
the
sweet
side
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
and
typical
of
the
style
its
not
all
that
good
a
beer
to
drink
straight
its
not
sour
enough
to
be
interesting
and
doesnt
offer
much
else
would
like
to
try
this
with
woodruff
syrup
though
sourcing
purchased
at
heb
in
texas
for
4
19
plus
tax
for
a
twentytwo
ounce
bottle
amazing
price
point
for
a
bomber
and
comes
through
with
some
nice
character
a
pretty
good
go
at
the
style
fun
to
drink
though
i
wish
it
popped
a
bit
more
on
the
palate
crispness
and
tartness
all
in
all
a
decent
example
of
the
style
o
i
dont
mind
fluffing
this
beer
i
really
enjoy
it
as
a
session
able
sour
drinker
the
thing
that
makes
it
really
outstanding
is
the
price
5
bucks
a
bottle
for
a
22oz
sour
that
is
well
made
and
refreshing
and
sessionable
gets
my
vote
one
of
my
favorite
full
sails
pouring
a
hazy
murky
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
that
falls
off
to
a
ring
leaving
little
lacing
this
looks
like
any
other
bw
the
nose
is
extremely
grainy
and
wheaty
smelling
almost
wholly
of
wheat
with
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
some
grape
notes
the
palate
opens
moderately
tart
with
a
yogurty
lactic
tartness
with
plenty
of
wheat
and
grain
husk
extremely
disjointed
and
utterly
lacking
in
structure
this
is
a
very
poor
example
of
the
style
a
touch
of
sulfur
is
present
light
in
body
and
crisply
carbonated
this
beer
has
a
drying
yogurty
lactic
finish
meh
this
ale
has
a
nice
crystal
clear
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
thick
white
head
that
quickly
thins
into
a
layer
of
bubbles
surrounded
by
some
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
filled
with
malts
and
grass
tones
with
a
nice
touch
of
citrus
fruits
it
does
smell
light
and
refreshing
its
light
bodied
and
refreshing
and
very
sour
and
thats
about
all
i
get
maybe
some
granny
smith
apples
and
very
very
mild
wheat
it
does
go
down
well
and
is
pretty
refreshing
overall
not
the
best
berliner
weiss
but
serviceable
wouldnt
buy
another
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
surprisingly
malty
and
lacking
in
tartness
for
the
style
there
is
no
alcohol
inclusion
which
is
fitting
but
just
not
enough
positive
things
to
say
about
this
this
was
quite
a
let
down
and
had
some
things
both
going
on
and
missing
about
it
to
make
it
not
worth
seeking
out
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
but
i
would
not
drink
it
again
and
it
pains
me
to
say
that
the
price
point
is
nice
on
this
bottle
it
just
isnt
fitting
for
thr
style
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
sparse
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
and
grain
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
wheat
and
sour
lemonlike
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
smell
is
lacking
any
indication
of
sourness
and
what
sourness
is
coming
across
in
the
flavor
is
fairly
subdued
d
like
any
good
berliner
weisse
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
one
doesnt
think
before
reaching
for
another
sip
its
reflexively
drinkable
though
i
would
be
more
interested
in
a
beer
that
was
less
objectionable
more
tart
and
perhaps
more
funky
with
a
little
brett
character
yet
this
is
a
berliner
weisse
for
the
masses
and
one
cant
fault
a
beer
with
that
label

i
got
fizzed
like
the
dickens
but
not
for
too
long

i
got

into
a

has
a
strong

yeasty
overtone

it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
solar
yellow
with

thick
if
not
too
persistent
fluffy
white
head
flavor
is
quite
tart
mainly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
malt
drinks
more
like
a
cider
than
a
beer
still
crisp
and
refreshing
texture
has
average
body
and
fizz
ok
not
full
sails
best
but
a
decent
effort
do
easy
to
drink
this
beer
tastes
like
a
slightly
malty
soft
drink
rather
than
a
real
sour
ale
it
is
saved
by
its
smell
which
seems
respectable
from
top
to
bottom
appearance
is
golden
light
supporting
a
thin
crisp
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lace
smell
is
light

nose
with

and
lemon
citrus
taste
has
the
malt

and
a
sour

that
chases
to
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
with

certainly
wakes
the
mouth
up

that
punch
of
tart

overall
considering
it
is
over
2
months
old
thanks
fucking
sls
i
believe
it
is
not
fair
to
really
judge
this
one
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
and
i
have
to
get
in
the
fucking
business
to
start
checking
out
fuckn
labels
in
the
state
liquor
stores
their
such
fucking
assholes
perhaps
this
is
a
true
connoisseurs
beer
i
wont
know
till
later
overall
not
a
great
weissbier
just
okay
overall
this
beer
has
some
flaws
but
it
has
a
good
tartness
and
a
decent
feel
overall
its
an
ok
berliner
weisse
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
odcouldnt
pass
up
on
a
cheap
berliner
full
sail
did
a
great
job
on
this
unique
style
at
under
5
a
bomber
this
was
a
decent
deal
too
i
thought
this
was
pretty
awesome
underrated
o
a
refreshing
summer
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
a
decent
beer
but
very
one
dimensional
overall
a
bit
disappointing
o
great
blend
of
fruit
flavors
in
this
beer
with
a
really
nice
tartness
this
would
be
a
great
introductory
sour
beer
the
body
of
this
beer
is
super
light
great
on
a
really
hot
day
but
on
any
other
day
the
body
could
be
underwhelming

right

i
wonder
if
this
would
go
good
with
some
cordialsyrups
as
it
is
its
acceptable
o
this
is
a
refreshing
and
tasty
berliner
weiss
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
sour
slightly
in
the
flavor
lemon
peach
apricot
and
other
summer
fruits
its
crisp
refreshing
a
great
lawnmower
beer
lots
of
carbonation
dances
and
clears
the
palate
and
finishes
very
dry
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
not
blowing
up
my
skirt
overall
i
found
it
to
be
both
pleasant
and
quite
refreshing
which
was
what
i
was
looking
for
in
this
beer
i
cant
positively
say
how
close
this
is
to
the
berliner
kindl
that
i
used
to
drink
back
in
the
mid80s
when
living
in
berlin
but
its
seems
like
a
faithful
stab
at
the
style
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
perhaps
about
more
sour
than
the
kindl
but
definitely
hitting
the
style
description
as
listed
in
ba
a
nice
alternative
to
a
traditional
german
hefeweizen
ok
this
is
a
little
too
clean
for
a
berliner
weiss
but
its
a
tasty
summer
beer
nevertheless
the
aroma
is
soft
and
bready
with
a
toasted
edge
light
caramel
and
more
freshbaked
bread
malts
fill
the
flavor
theres
a
mild
sour
tang
and
its
pleasant
enough
but
this
beer
is
too
clean
to
be
a
true
example
of
the
style
of
course
you
can
just
call
it
the
american
wheat
version
of
a
berliner
weiss
and
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
decent
overall
though
im
a
firm
believer
that
berliners
should
be
fruited
funky
buddha
has
spoiled
me
drinkability
is
fine
its
a
guzzler
very
refreshing
just
not
one
to
instill
much
reflection
i
really
like
this
style
but
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
not
bad
but
not
great
taste
is
flat
and
empty
compared
to
others
ive
had
hazy
weisse
dark
straw
color
as
expected
very
quick
head
but
well
carbonated
hard
to
tell
this
is
a
berliner
by
the
aroma
very
light
tart
note
same
with
the
flavor
very
mild
for
a
berliner
its
hard
to
even
describe
it
as
sour
or
tart
maybe
a
bit
tangy
but
thats
it
i
did
notice
some
unusual
salty
and
sweet
notes
as
it
warmed
up
which
were
interesting
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
a
disappointed
berliner
for
me
pours
a
pale
straw
with
good
amount
of
white
head
and
good
retention
sour
nose
with
wheat
malt
and
hint
of
apple
taste
follows
with
sourness
and
apple
flavor
apple
is
less
appealing
than
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
sour
is
welcome
on
this
hot
summer
night
overall
a
good
attempt
at
a
berliner
weiss
o
something
quite
interesting
i
would
drink
it
on
occasion
not
a
session
beer
or
one
i
would
seek
out
its
a
solid
beer
for
sure
and
i
like
the
tartness
to
it
its
not
soured
by
any
means
but
contains
that
nice
lemonlike
zingy
flare
with
a
nice
grainy
wheat
edge
good
representation
of
the
style
though
i
would
love
to
see
it
unfiltered
and
ready
for
a
dash
of
syrup
perhaps
o
flavors
are
pretty
good
though
light
making
this
very
drinkable
im
not
getting
any
citrus
i
easily
went
through
the
entire
22oz

well
with
food

bright
yellow
with
a

smell
is
a
mix
of
cardboard
and
wheat
flavor
is
the
most
subtle
tarness
wheat
hint
of
lacto
surely
not
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
as
far
as
the
style
this
is
disappointing
overall
oh
well
at
least
it
was
cheap
overall
i
like
this
its
not
as
good
as
other
berliner
weisses
out
there
but
at
least
its
a
good
prologue
to
the
anchorage
galaxy
white
ipa
im
about
to
indulge
in
this
is
quite
sessionable
and
its
the
only
full
sail
i
find
myself
liking
cheers
the
bartender
confirmed
that
the
beer
has
not
sold
well
at
beermongers
and
has
not
been
a
popular
beer
with
his
customers
i
can
see
why
ive
been
a
big
fan
of
fs
beers
over
the
years
especially
the
brewmaster
reserve
series
this
is
easily
the
worst
beer
i
can
ever
recall
having
from
fs
o
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
quite
dark
for
the
style
when
compared
with
other
offerings
doesnt
really
taste
authentic
to
the
style
a
little
too
full
bodied
and
malty
enjoyable
but
not
as
light
and
refreshing
as
others
in
the
style
and
expectation
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
sessionable
o
i
could
easy
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
it
is
a
nice
sessionable
beer
for
the
summer
months
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
but
the
lemony
flavors
almost
make
it
seem
like
fruit
syrup
has
already
been
added
to
the
beer
easy
drinking
fairly
refreshing
however
its
average
for
the
style
and
rather
boring
super
easytodrink
offering
that
offers
a
simple
flavor
profile
with
a
very
refreshing
crisp
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
light
orange
straw
amber
minimal
head
but
a
ring
around
the
glass
with
slight
slippery
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
light
citrus
and
a
lactic
hint
flavor
starts
with
tart
lemony
wheat
and
develops
into
a
light
biscuit
malt
wheat
and
lemon
the
tartness
is
dominant
and
other
flavors
are
subdued
light
bodied
but
nice
mouth
feel
with
sharp
active
carbonation
a
refreshing
understated
weissbier
with
a
balanced
amount
of
lactic
tartness
one
finger
white
rapidly
dissipating

over

gold
clear

champagne

effervescence
quickly
leading
to
some
clinging
bubbles
on
side
of

and
a
few
small
bubbles
rising
from
bottom
of
etched
glass
the
lacto
is
fairly
prevalent
in
the
nose
wet
hay
and
a
bit
of
sourness
taste
is
a
bit
more
tart
than
sour
though
the
finish
will
make
you
pucker
up
lemony
clean
light
wheat
no
hops
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
well
on
the
light
side
of
medium
about
right
for
style
decent
effervescence
could
have
used
some
more
conditioning
but
at
this
price
point
certainly
a
good
value
worth
a
try
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
berlinerweiss
cool
to
see
them
doing
things
like
this
the
nose
is
definitely
a
bit
funky
while
the
taste
has
more
sour
citrus
and
lemon
wheat
is
present
throughout
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
would
have
it
again

the

surprisingly
transient
the
finish
is
longer
than
i
had
anticipated
with
grain
and
grass
with
a
hint
of
dry
tartness
like
i
just
swallowed
some
plain
yogurt
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
with
moderate

and
a
wet
finish
clocking
in
at

this
is
on
the
low
end
for
us
berliners
but
the
high
end
for
berlin
i
like
this
version
although
im
guessing
it
isnt
natural
lacto
nor
is
there
any
brett
so
the
beer
really
does
merit
a
best
by
nonetheless
im
not
put
out
by
the
offering
certainly
worth
the
5
i
paid
o
not
the
most
complex
berliner
in
the
world
but
it
is
very
much
to
style
in
abv
and
taste
plus
at
less
than

a
bomber
the
price
is
right
for
those
who
want
to
get
into
this
style
which
for
some
reason
is
much
more
expensive
than
it
should
be
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
apples

fresh
cut
lemons
pours
a
tantalizing
straw
color
thick

retention
as
per
the
foam

gushes

an
emphasis
on
a
restrained

some

solid

definitely
would

this
again
in

o
i

this
came
in
cans
because
i
would
drink
a
case
of
this
on
all

i
love
me
a

o
interesting
brew
this
is
not
one
of
my
normal
styles
but
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
overall
really
glad
i
got
this
in
a
trade
as
an
extra
fun
beer
and
quite
delicious

for

twinge

a
very
crisp
finish
and
without
the
dirty
wheat
that
i
usually
find
unpleasant
at
the
end
of
the
sip
for
this
style
some
definite
white
wine
notes
that
were
picked
up
even
before
reading
on
the
label
that
reislings
were
used
extremely
light
bodied
and
almost
spritzy
carbonation
really
more
of
a
sour
golden
ale
than
a
wheaty
berliner
lucky
for
me
that
is
more
to
my
tasting
good
stuff
as
usual
from
new
glarus
if
we
really
want
to
call
this
a
berliner
i
dont
think
there
is
anything
close
to
this
yum
this
is
a
brew
that
will
be
best
enjoyed
in
the
heat
its
light
and
a
very
nice
offering
from
the
wizards
of
brew
at
new
glarus
the
only
thing
i
would
poke
at
a
bit
is
the
overthetop
carbonation
and
i
had
to
wait
longer
to
enjoy
the
beer
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
do
not
reccomend
though
unless
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
tart
and
refreshing
are
probably
the
key
words
for
this
brew
the
body
is
light
but
it
is
extremely
fluffy
and
the
high
carbonation
lets
the
fruity
acidic
flavors
shine
o
a
perfect
warm
weather
refresher
the
taste
is
quite
complex
for
such
a
lightbodied
beer
but
it
works
magnificently

for
me
hacker
pschorr
is
how
a
weiss
beer
should
be
ive
tried
many
many
weiss
beers
its
one
of
the
great
things
in
summer
i
couldnt
drink
this
got
a
bottle
from
a
friend
and
im
very
grateful
this
is
among
the
best
berliner
weiss
ales
domestic
or
import
ive
tried
the
aroma
has
a
tart
orange
and
raspberry
character
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
cream
the
flavor
expands
with
grainy
oak
barrel
touches
that
join
the
vanilla
with
sharp
acidic
white
grapes
this
is
a
subtle
but
crisp
beer
with
an
impressive
depth
of
flavor
and
a
wonderfully
balanced
sour
tang
to
the
light
bready
sweetness
find
this
beer
wow
this
is
quite
nice
complex
esp
in
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
are
very
good
too
and
an
easy
drinker
perfect
for
humidity
i
love
this
beer
well
done
as
usual
new
glarus
ps
bottlecap
shows
dark
spots
mold
under
the
seal
however
not
in
a
spot
that
it
would
infect
the
beer
allegedly
being
3
abv
its
not
a
good
candidate
for
extended
aging
anyway
o
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
perfect
for
the
summer
months
delicious
summer
beer
a
little
less
lemon
than
other
weissbeers
with
more
of
a
grassy
saison
profile
ng
bw
is
built
for
endurance
drinking
on
a
hot
day
i
could
drink
this
forever
i
did
find
this
to
be
a
pip
behind
weiss
trash
culture
but
this
is
still
a
terrific
all
day
hot
day
beer
glad
more
is
a
short
ride
away
overall
one
of
the
best
berliners
in
the
world
and
possibly
the
best
brewed
in
the
states
its
a
shame
that
this
one
wont
be
available
to
purchase
unless
you
hit
up
a
shop
within
a
few
days
worth
trading
for
even
if
youre
risking
an
exploding
bottle
in
transit
definitely
not
infected
the
recall
is
in
no
way
qualityrelated
this
beer
is
slightly
wild
and
benefits
from
it
o
great
beer
ill
drink
it
all
summer
overall
another
homerun
from
new
glarus
their
execution
of
difficult
styles
is
elite
in
every
way
and
rarely
rivaled
this
beer
has
great
balance
of
yeast
malt
tartness
and
bright
fruits
there
is
sort
of
a
chardonnay
feeling
to
this
brew
a
lovely
change
of
pace
for
the
drinker
who
gets
stuck
in
traditional
styles
overall
one
of
the
most
flavorful
berliner
weiss
ive
had
real
nice
o
a
nice
berliner
for
sure
not
overly
sour
at
all
but
still
tart
enough
with
just
a
bit
of
funk
to
suffice
i
dont
know
that
its
spectacular
enough
to
really
hunt
down
but
if
this
were
available
on
the
shelves
around
me
it
would
be
nearly
a
constant
fixture
in
the
refrigerator
o
a
very
easy
drinker
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
intensity
but
overall
a
positive
drinking
experience
overall
i
think
this
beer
has
mellowed
just
a
bit
since
its
been
bottled
the
smell
is
a
little
on
the
weak
end
and
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
tart
and
fruity
as
id
like
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
i
wish
i
got
to
it
sooner
but
still
a
good
berliner
o
a
nice
refreshing
berliner
with
subtle
flavors
and
a
wellcontrolled
tartness
the
only
thing
that
might
make
it
better
is
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
be
interested
in
trying
a
fresher
bottle
o
very
nice
and
would
definitely
have
again
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
of
a
sour
bite
o
had
this
beer
fresh
and
it
was
tremendous
i
layed
a
few
away
and
i
am
sad
to
say
this
was
my
last
bottle
it
was
still
very
delicious
after
a
yr
i
am
hoping
new
glarus
brings
this
one
back
soon
pour

a

this
beer
would
be
sessionable
for
me
overall
another
great
beer
from
new
glarus
incredibly
tasty
and
refreshing
if
this
were
more
easily
available
it
would
be
the
perfect
beer
to
have
on
had
at
all
times
during
the
summer
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
and
also
a
great
intro
beer
to
those
new
to
sours
o
overall
this
was
a
delicious
berliner
tastes
like
they
berlinered
up
their
apple
ale
they
have
either
used
riesling
grapes
in
this
or
barrels
because
there
is
that
unmistakeable
taste
well
done
o
a
very
nice
berliner
as
stated
carb
is
a
bit
high
which
makes
this
a
little
less
easy
drinking
and
masks
some
of
the
complexity
a
bit
but
it
does
have
a
nice
sour
pucker
to
go
along
with
the
grainy
wheat
notes
thumbs
up
poured
into
a
proper
ng
pokal
a
golden
color
with
hardly
any
haze
at
all
topped
with
an
unexpectedly
longlasting
cap
of
bubbly
white
head
champagnelike
carbonation
blipping
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
promised
some
tartness
notes
of
lemon
and
toasted
wheat
the
flavor
reflected
the
nose
lemony
with
a
nice
tang
to
it
sour
white
grapes
toasted
wheat
crackery
malts
and
some
haylike
funk
underneath
this
is
pretty
much
what
berliners
are
all
about
body
was
light
to
lightmedium
very
easily
drinkable
and
smooth
enough
in
the
mouthfeel
that
even
if
you
dont
like
sour
beers
id
venture
to
say
youd
be
able
to
handle
this
one
very
nice
overall
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
as
complex
a
berliner
weisse
as
youll
find
this
along
with
every
other
new
glarus
beer
i
try
lately
is
nothing
short
of
outstanding
o
a
refreshing
example
of
the
style
creamier
and
more
vinous
than
others
ive
tried
would
be
excellent
with
a
splash
of
syrup
very
very
good
o
a
very
nice
berliner
tart
then
some
sweet
wheat
crisp
and
refreshing
o
while
snow
may
be
falling
outside
my
window
this
beer
is
a
crisp
refreshing
reminder
of
how
much
i
love
the
warm
weather
a
soft
easy
drinking
berliner
what
berliners
arent
with
everything
in
the
right
place
extremely
well
done
i
hope
this
one
continues
and
i
hope
to
have
a
case
in
my
fridge
for
when
the
snow
clears
very
refreshing
with
a
little
funk
that
was
just
right
a
great
summertime
beer
honey
and
citrusy
notes
great
color
head
was
a
nice
color
and
held
well
for
the
style
some
lacing
but
just
right
for
the
style
aroma
was
a
little
weak
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
o
the
best
berliner
weiss
ive
ever
had
love
the
style
love
this
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
tart
berliner
weiss
beers
in
existence
id
drink
it
all
day
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
definitely
sour
but
i
did
not
find
it
to
be
overpoweringly
sour
it
strikes
a
nice
chord
with
the
sour
lactic
flavors
one
expects
in
this
style
and
the
soft
bready
flavors
of
the
wheat
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
malt
grain
lemon
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
grain
and
lemon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
low
b
overall
a
wonderfull
beer
and
one
that
i
may
have
to
make
a
point
of
acquiring
for
next
summer
there
really
is
nothing
beer
than
tipping
back
a
nice
tart
and
refreshing
bw
in
warm
weather
id
really
like
to
know
what
the
alc
is
for
this
one
so
ill
need
to
do
a
little
research
i
suppose
i
dont
feel
the
booze
affect
so
if
they
jammed
all
this
flavor
in
a
session
brew
im
even
more
impressed
very
well
done
hits
all
the
marks
with
flying
colors
great
lactic
aroma
with
plenty
of
tartness
on
the
palate
this
one
has
enough
acidity
to
burn
he
teeth
a
bit
worth
seeking
out
overall
not
sure
whats
going
on
with
the
smell
but
a
good
tasting
and
looking
beer
d
nice
xample
of
the
style
clean
refreshing
dry
and
firing
on
all
cylinders
o
not
my
favorite
berliner
but
its
a
great
one
could
drink
this
one
all
day
every
day
o
deliciously
refreshing
and
drinkable
very
balanced
with
a
nice
subtle
fruitiness
definitely
enjoyed
more
of
this
guy
oh
the
new
glarus
one
shots
good
and
then
gone
overall
an
outstanding
interpretation
of
the
style
beautiful
looking
beer
with
an
awesome
tart
punch
the
grapes
added
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
to
the
nose
and
taste
the
label
mentioned
barrel
fermentation
but
i
got
no
barrel
notes
whatsoever
overall
a
great
summer
beer
that
is
highly
recommended
o
i
guess
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
this
compared
to
most
peeps
here
still
it
was
a
good
drinker
just
not
the
berliner
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
the
beer
is
light
golden
and
transparent
with
a
thin
pure
white
head
the
aroma
offers
grain
pilsner
malt
fruity
esters
the
flavor
is
ok
cereal
grains
with
a
hint
of
sourdough
bread
a
bit
underwhelming
zesty
carbonation
with
fruity
hop
notes
this
was
ok
but
i
dont
see
myself
returning
to
this
beer
again
i
remember
thoroughly
enjoying
this
stuff
at
barrington
brew
fest
2013
so
i
was
pleased
to
get
another
shot
at
it
at
tonights
tasting
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
sunrise
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
lemon
zest
backed
by
a
mildlysweet
twinge
of
cracked
wheat
i
think
i
get
some
coriander
in
there
but
it
might
just
be
a
figment
of
my
imagination
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
sourness
really
shining
through
without
becoming
oerwhelming
the
body
is
a
rather
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
damn
solid
berliner
one
that
makes
me
wish
we
had
easier
access
to
new
glarus
down
here
good
times
overall
solid
base
berliner
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
overall
incredibly
refreshing
beer
tart
up
front
wonderfully
balanced
white
wine
notes
fantastic
mouth
feel
extremely
impressed
with
this
even
my
mother
and
wife
who
are
non
craft
beer
enthusiast
loved
this
beer
o
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
the
most
flavorful
or
tart
berliner
weiss
that
ive
had
but
it
was
a
very
good
traditional
interpretation
of
the
style
that
was
quite
sessionable
with
subtle
complexities
i
probably
wouldnt
say
this
is
my
favorite
berliner
but
it
was
well
balanced
and
definitely
a
treat
to
drink
id
definitely
say
this
is
worth
trying
but
not
necessarily
a
beer
that
should
be
extremely
sought
after
i
really
love
this
thing
tart
crisp
funky
and
filled
with
an
array
of
flavors
the
low
alcohol
and
firm
carbonation
that
lasts
throughout
makes
this
a
wonderful
session
beer
unlike
any
ive
ever
had
i
want
these
every
summer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
if
possible
truly
great
stuff
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
new
glarus
this
was
a
fantastic
example
of
a
berliner
weissbier
poured
a
lovely
pale
golden
with
decent
lacing
it
was
light
crisp
a
hint
of
sour
and
dare
i
say
sessionable
cant
imagine
what
i
would
change
about
it
o
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
a
berliner
weissbier
its
light
crisp
mildly
sour
crazy
drinkable
and
wonderfully
tasty
this
really
cant
get
much
better
if
you
love
berliner
weisses
check
this
one
out
thanks
for
the
fantastic
beer
jared
cheers
o
drinks
really
nice
but
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
is
too
much
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
but
im
assuming
in
the
3
range
reminds
me
a
lot
of
champagne
havent
had
much
experience
with
this
style
but
im
assuming
this
is
near
the
top
of
the
class
i
definitely
recommend
picking
up
a
4pk
of
this
for
those
who
can
acquire
it
if
you
are
looking
for
a
more
sour
feel
then
id
recommend
their
other
seasonal
right
now
wild
sour
ale
but
this
is
not
to
be
overlooked
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
levels
of
carbonation
intensity
resulting
in
a
perfectly
foamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
that
complements
the
beer
quite
nicely
closes
semidry
with
surprisingly
substantial
stickiness
on
the
lips
and
palate
would
get
again
o
i
always
look
forward
to
what
dan
at
new
glarus
will
put
out
next
and
i
have
looked
forward
to
them
putting
this
back
out
for
quite
some
time
now
and
it
does
not
disappoint
in
any
way
there
is
no
better
beer
to
consume
on
a
hot
summers
day
than
this
beer
alot
of
this
will
be
consumed
this
summer
for
sure
o
i
didnt
come
into
this
beer
with
any
expectations
and
i
was
pleased
for
my
first
experience
with
new
glarus
this
beer
is
really
quite
good
and
is
also
quite
different
from
anything
ive
had
before
to
be
fair
this
is
an
entirely
new
style
to
me
so
i
cannot
comment
on
this
beer
against
others
in
a
fair
way
but
this
has
been
a
really
nice
treat
id
drink
this
again
and
since
duffman929
kindly
sent
two
bottles
im
pretty
sure
i
will
drink
it
again
o
an
interesting
delicate
beer
with
no
rough
edges
perfect
for
a
warm
nc
evening
overall
this
is
the
ultimate
in
beerrefreshment
love
it
for
what
it
is
and
enjoying
it
now
not
sure
it
would
have
the
same
effect
on
a
5
degree
chicago
winter
day
though
try
this
this
summer
if
you
can
o
again
first
time
with
this
style
and
i
have
to
admit
that
i
loved
it
i
received
this
as
an
extra
and
im
not
sure
of
the
availability
but
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
more
of
this
style
and
hopefully
can
land
some
more
from
new
glarus

is
at

off
their

with
this

nailing
the
berliner

almost
flawlessly
its
crisp

make
it
the
perfect

beer
to
indulge
and
to
change
it
up
try
it
with

simulate
the
way
germans
add

between
this
and
now
the
wild
sour

dan
carey
is
knocking
the
thumbprint
releases
out
of
the
park
looks
like
a
berliner
with
light
yellow
color
three
ever
growing
fingers
of
bone
white
suds
from
the
continuous
column
of
bubbles
from
the
most
inferior
aspect
of
the
glass
smells
like
lemons
white
grape
skins
some
funk
a
little
metal
some
grain
and
lacto
sharpness
soon
as
the
head
dies
down
a
hair
im
gonna
taste
it
nice
lightly
crisp
ale
with
some
pear
some
lemon
sweetened
a
grain
and
rice
mix
some
light
tartness
and
a
bit
of
almost
sweetness
on
the
finish
looks
light
but
feels
heavier
than
i
had
anticipated
nice
razor
carb
and
a
wet
finish
i
like
this
beer
i
would
drink
all
day
from
the
can
on
the
lakes
overall
really
a
nice
stab
at
the
style
i
almost
left
wisconsin
without
a
bottle
and
i
am
glad
i
didnt
d
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
drinking
on
a
hot
day
but
one
maybe
two
would
be
quite
enough
cost
10
99
for
a
four
pack
great
summer
beer
high
overall
for
a
tasty
drinkable
low
abv
beer
verdict
a
delightful
berliner
weiss
from
new
glarus
insanely
refreshing
and
light
yet
remarkably
satisfying
this
is
definitely
the
perfect
summer
beer
and
one
of
the
best
american
made
takes
on
the
style
d
overall
this
is
a
solid
berliner
weiss
especially
made
in
america
the
low
abv
flavors
and
price
make
this
a
very
tough
beer
to
beat
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
than
6
of
them
this
is
not
the
most
wild
or
most
interesting
berliner
weiss
that
ive
had
but
it
may
be
the
most
refreshing
and
the
most
drinkable
if
this
were
easier
to
get
i
would
be
buying
a
lot
o
glad
i
saw
this
in
the
store
during
my
trip
to
the
land
of
cheese
given
space
in
my
suitcase
id
take
home
a
case
of
these
light
crisp
and
a
bit
tart
like
that
lil
hottie
that
raul
pulled
from
the
make
your
own
succulent
party
raul
likes
it
but
he
defi
has
had
better
berliner
weisses
and
like
said
lil
hottie
raulsky
prob
wont
be
calling
this
one
back
o
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
if
only
i
lived
in
wisconsin
o
this
is
super
refreshing
beer
for
warmer
weather
this
is
only
one
of
two
bws
that
ive
had
but
it
is
a
wellcrafted
brew
o
need
to
start
with
the
nose
i
dont
want
to
present
the
wrong
idea
it
isnt
bad
just
isnt
there
very
faint
grapewheat
with
a
touch
of
carmel
has
the
mouth
and
taste
of
a
champagne
crisp
tartness
very
pleasant
one
note
this
must
be
drunk
moderately
warm
60
degrees
too
cold
and
youre
going
to
miss
all
the
flavor
certainly
a
celebration
beer
i
did
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
sour
tho
i
think
i
liked
this
one
more
than
even
hottenroth
wow
call
it
one
of
the
greatest
beers
for
summer
ever
made
holy
crap
this
beer
is
amazing
i
was
out
off
by
the
initial
smell
which
was
really
reminiscent
of
a
really
brut
champagne
but
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
scent
of
sweet
white
wine
took
over
glorious
the
slightly
cloudy
pale
brew
has
delightful
carbonation
and
a
wonderfully
mouthfilling
flavor
unique
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
perfect
for
summer
sipping
it
could
also
be
paired
with
cheeses
much
like
a
fine
white
wine
a
remarkable
brew
o
ive
had
some
berliner
weisses
that
i
thought
were
okay
and
some
that
i
did
not
like
this
one
is
very
good
delicate
but
full
of
flavor
and
extremely
drinkable
o
beautiful
looking
berliner
weiss
big
white
head
hangs
on
longer
than
expected
smell
was
deceiving
by
holding
back
that
acidity
before
unraveling
it
big
in
the
taste
a
very
fun
brew
to
kickoff
my
summer
very
mellow
but
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
not
intense
in
any
way
so
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
think
i
need
more
o
overall
this
is
not
the
beer
i
will
drink
again
not
a
big
champagne
fan
but
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
try
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
poured
into
a
goblet
the
beer
was
a
straw
color
with
an
intense
bubbly
white
head
as
the
bubbles
receded
lacing
streaked
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
little
on
the
mild
side
with
notes
of
lemon
and
wheat
on
the
initial
taste
one
gets
bright
lemon
lemon
rind
biscuit
and
some
muted
earthy
tones
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
sticks
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
in
a
manner
that
makes
you
want
to
scrape
the
taste
off
with
your
tongue
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
eating
a
granny
smith
apple
the
carbonation
was
fairly
intense
so
the
flavor
does
not
last
exceptionally
long
carbonation
brushes
away
the
lemony
notes
fairly
quickly
the
is
not
my
favorite
edition
of
the
unplugged
series
but
i
would
drink
it
again
light
and
refreshing
too
bad
this
is
a
one
off
and
also
that
im
not
around
wi
to
get
ng
beers
overall
a
pretty
good
fruity
wheat
beer
has
many
white
wine
characteristics
but
enough
wheat
and
grain
to
make
it
a
beer
o
nothing
ground
breaking
and
honestly
ive
had
home
brews
that
were
better
but
this
is
still
a
really
solid
berliner
i
would
love
to
have
regular
access
to
this
as
it
would
probably
never
leave
my
fridge
during
the
summer
the
sourness
in
this
beer
is
subdued
and
not
overpowering
making
this
is
a
refreshing
easy
to
drink
berliner
weiss
the
fruitiness
adds
a
nice
touch
to
this
beer
although
different
then
most
beers
of
this
style
with
its
subdued
sourness
and
stronger
fruity
character
i
really
like
it
for
its
drinkability
and
mix
of
malt
yeast
sour
and
fruit
purists
of
the
style
likely
to
be
disappointed
o
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
sours
but
this
one
might
just
convince
me
otherwise
really
a
well
done
brew
and
possibly
my
favorite
thumbprint
yet
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
berliner
weiss
and
if
this
is
a
true
example
of
the
style
it
may
be
my
last
wow
this
is
some
sour
sour
stuff
it
is
clearly
a
well
crafted
beer
with
its
fine
carbonation
beautiful
light
body
champagne
like
mouthfeel
and
dryness
but
i
cant
get
past
the
sour
taste
enough
to
really
enjoy
the
complexities
of
this
beer
dan
carey
is
a
great
brewer
and
i
am
a
big
fan
of
many
of
his
creations
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
for
this
one
again
although
i
might
an
incredible
americanbrewed
berliner
i
am
in
love
o
overall
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
berliner
not
overly
sour
or
funky
but
has
notes
of
both
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
mind
blowing
but
considering
it
is
not
hard
to
trade
for
and
they
sell
it
for
about
114
pack
well
worth
the
investment
to
me
a
good
summer
beer
glad
to
have
another
few
bottles
of
it
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
carbonated
dry
reisling
it
is
a
key
summer
brew
it
really
hit
the
spot
after
a
day
of
mowing
very
light
lemon
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
you
can
smell
the
tartness
on
the
nose
and
it
invites
you
in
like
a
cold
lemonade
the
taste
is
bright
and
effervescent
highly
recommend
tastes
fantastic
though
beautiful
crisp
and
tart
on
the
palate
pushing
sour
nice
fermented
wheat
flavors
a
little
white
grape
and
lemongrass
nice
overall
this
is
a
great
berlinner
weiss
that
dan
brewed
here
bravo
dan
i
get
the
feeling
that
you
are
going
to
have
a
banner
year
in
wisconsin
craft
beer
this
year
dan
never
dissapoints
when
he
has
brewed
a
german
beer
style
glancing
at
the
reviews
i
guess
im
in
the
minority
this
is
pretty
good
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
the
way
for
good
grilling
beer
softball
beer
fishing
beer
certainly
refreshing
but
not
up
to
the
high
standards
of
new
glarus
imho
edit
after
a
couple
months
of
aging
this
beer
just
gets
better
a
bit
more
acidity
pushes
this
thing
over
the
edge
very
nice
and
refreshing
with
lovely
complexity
for
a
beer
thats
so
light
so
easy
to
drink
the
bottle
was
gone
in
seconds
it
seemed
and
i
could
easily
crush
a
six
pack
of
this
without
even
thinking
about
it
a
very
nice
summer
beer
to
have
by
your
side
not
exactly
a
traditional
berliner
what
with
the
white
grapes
and
barrel
fermenting
and
all
but
its
so
damn
delicious
iso
a
case
of
this
every
time
the
weather
gets
warm
chris
lemke
of
wisconsinbrewreview
com
o
great
beer
very
drinkable
i
will
defiantly
be
picking
more
of
this
up
for
the
summer
perhaps
the
best
lawnmower
beer
ever
new
glarus
berliner
weiss
nails
everything
you
look
for
in
a
berliner
slight
funk
cleanliness
and
a
high
drinkability
one
of
the
few
unpluggedthumbprints
i
havent
had
up
until
tonight
thanks
for
picking
this
up
for
me
egrace84
o
this
is
a
perfect
hot
summer
day
beer
light
crisp
tart
and
refreshing
well
this
is
a
summer
beer
i
can
get
behind
nice
and
complex
but
clearly
in
session
abv
standards
could
drink
this
all
day
if
it
were
not
9
bucks
a
4
pack
i
still
might
though
m
refreshing
quenching
and
wellmade
o
from
beginning
to
end
just
a
really
great
beer
cant
wait
to
drink
the
others
i
have
highly
suggest
searching
this
out
if
you
like
the
style
4
50
overall
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
this
this
the
quintessential
summer
craft
brew
imo
the
3rd
best
thumbprint
behind
iipa
and
enigma
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
sourness
to
it
but
leaving
it
light
definitely
makes
it
a
bit
more
unique
and
probably
will
attract
more
beer
drinkers
will
be
a
huge
memorial
day
weekend
hit
o
dan
carey
i
bow
to
your
greatness
on
producing
delicious
quality
beer
overall
very
refreshing
great
summer
beer
its
not
full
of
flavour
like
an
dipa
or
imperial
stout
is
but
it
has
an
incredibly
refreshing
hydrating
quality
to
it
the
tartness
and
sweetness
of
this
beer
makes
this
feel
like
an
actual
beer
rather
than
just
a
watered
down
hefeweizen
its
more
of
a
champagne
than
a
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
out
more
beers
of
this
style
4
25
if
you
are
a
fan
of
wine
you
will
love
this
o
complex
flavor
that
doesnt
get
borring
refreshing
and
not
to
pricey
in
wi
if
you
like
sours
you
wont
be
disapointed
overall
dan
carey
killed
this
beer
based
on
my
very
limited
experience
with
other
berliner
weisses
this
is
not
only
the
best
ive
had
but
the
one
that
seems
to
best
meet
the
style
definitely
seek
this
out
im
picking
up
a
case
o
this
was
a
nice
treat
seeing
as
the
age
on
the
bottle
was
unknown
the
grapes
did
a
great
job
adding
and
keeping
their
characteristics
havent
felt
compelled
to
do
a
review
in
quite
some
time
but
this
beer
brought
me
out
of
retirement
absolute
perfection
in
a
glass
berliners
arent
a
glamorous
style
but
this
one
is
the
best
of
the
lot
super
fluffy
head
and
great
lacing
as
far
as
looks
go
tart
refreshing
lemony
crisp
and
clean
just
really
delightful
the
only
downside
is
that
its
ten
bucks
a
four
pack
but
i
guess
thats
not
too
bad
i
only
mention
it
because
im
going
to
drink
the
shit
out
of
it
this
weekend
and
the
entire
case
will
be
gone
you
wont
find
a
better
berliner
o
cant
grade
this
on
a
typical
metric
for
the
style
that
aside
its
really
remarkable
and
very
unique
at
over
three
years
old
it
shows
no
signs
of
its
age
and
is
shining
brilliantly
another
dan
carey
success
4
55
obviously
not
you
typical
berliner
weiss
grapes
with
barrel
aging
once
in
a
while
i
run
into
a
beer
that
wows
me
this
is
one
of
them
overall
this
was
definitely
a
fun
experiment
my
first
venture
into
berliners
the
tartness
really
won
me
over
this
is
something
i
could
drink
for
a
while
overall
damn
trying
not
to
quaff
this
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
again
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
and
if
they
ever
make
it
again
doubtful
i
will
pick
up
many
for
sure
im
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
from
the
looks
of
it
a
couple
years
old
hot
damn
im
enjoying
this
from
a
bottle
pours
light
gold
with
a
large
eggshell
head
not
as
spritzy
as
some
examples
of
this
style
nose
is
quite
grainy
with
a
touch
of
lightly
sweet
stone
fruit
quite
tart
in
the
mouth
oddly
sweet
in
the
middle
with
a
bit
of
yeast
in
the
finish
very
sour
kind
of
sulfuric
at
times
quite
a
bit
of
wet
stone
and
mineral
in
there
as
well
the
mineral
aspect
of
this
is
not
entirely
pleasant
and
its
a
touch
too
sour
for
me
flavor
profile
is
just
kind
of
off
but
im
naturally
comparing
it
to
southamptons
which
just
destroys
this
a
decent
but
not
great
example
of
this
style
this
beer
looks
the
part
of
tart
it
is
just
a
shade
darker
then
lemon
and
hazy
as
all
get
out
only
a
thin
collar
is
left
around
the
edge
aroma
took
some
deep
nosing
for
me
to
really
get
into
a
faint
vinegar
and
funky
grape
aroma
however
the
flavors
really
hit
hard
in
the
green
granny
smith
apple
department
refined
lemon
tartness
that
finishes
with
a
dry
grape
note
superb
daniel
makes
so
many
beers
that
need
to
be
brewed
regularly
please
id
buy
cases
of
this
in
750s
enigma
too
pours
a
light
hazy
blonde
the
head
is
pretty
with
big
bubbles
but
goes
away
and
leaves
a
champagne
like
carbonation
aromas
are
lightly
funky
and
fruity
the
grapes
add
to
the
flavor
of
this
very
nicely
and
the
overall
flavor
is
dry
with
a
nice
sourness
taste
is
nicely
tart
light
and
airy
refreshing
is
an
understatement
mildly
sour
but
mostly
tart
unmalted
grains
creamy
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
insanely
fine
i
could
easily
drink
a
whole
12pack
of
this
at
a
summer
party
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
style
my
fullbottle
serving
was
gone
before
i
could
even
write
a
proper
review
muy
delicioso
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
lighter
golden
color
with
a
coastered
white
head
nice
lace
already
wheat
bread
aroma
with
a
light
toast
some
sourness
in
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
is
light
and
refreshing
starts
with
a
sweet
tart
apple
flavor
with
an
underlying
wheat
flavor
light
mouthfeel
some
lemon
notes
as
well
very
nice
slightly
tartfunky
earthy
flavor
with
a
good
bit
of
citrus
sweetness
for
balance
hints
of
grapefruit
lemon
peel
and
pepperclove
spice
medium
bodies
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
there
is
very
subtle
earthy
oak
and
a
tartness
providing
balance
to
the
sweeter
flavors
refrshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
bland
for
my
liking
easily
my
favorite
from
the
unplugged
series
so
far
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
one
tasty
beer
with
a
little
more
than
2
years
of
age
the
sourness
has
developed
quite
nicely
and
the
beer
itself
could
probably
still
go
for
another
year
or
two
the
nose
could
be
a
little
stronger
but
the
overall
experience
is
still
very
enjoyable
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
berliners
what
i
wouldnt
give
right
now
for
some
waldmeister
sirup
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
tint
light
white
head
and
a
tad
bit
of
lacing
nose
brings
some
very
light
fruits
as
well
as
a
bit
of
lactic
sourness
taste
is
light
lemon
and
peach
with
some
slight
sourness
and
a
bit
of
grain
slightly
tart
feel
with
good
carbonation
and
a
light
body
drinks
really
really
well
and
certainly
doesnt
need
any
syrup
the
beer
pours
a
yellowstraw
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
get
a
lot
of
tart
wheat
some
lemon
notes
and
surprisingly
some
cherries
the
flavor
is
cherries
wheat
lemons
and
oranges
the
beer
is
fairly
tart
and
very
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
even
as
the
glass
nears
being
empty
there
are
still
rapidly
rising
bubbles
of
carbonation
breaking
the
surface
of
this
brew
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
would
be
something
to
return
to
time
and
time
again
during
the
summer
my
only
gripe
about
this
beer
is
that
the
mild
fruity
skin
notes
of
apple
and
pear
really
stand
out
in
the
flavor
of
this
brew
and
i
would
have
liked
them
to
be
a
bit
more
subtle
other
than
that
overall
it
was
pretty
darn
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bigger
than
other
berliners
ive
tried
its
also
a
little
less
fizzy
than
id
like
this
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
brewday
but
i
wouldnt
have
had
another
one
due
to
the
acidic
feeling
i
got
in
my
throat
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
yellowgolden
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
wheat
sour
yeast
grape
straw
and
tart
flavor
is
sweet
malt
wheat
acidic
sour
apples
tart
lemons
and
straw
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
dry
acidic
and
refreshingly
complex
good
beer
puckering
d
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
ngs
id
probably
rather
drink
totally
naked
overall
nicely
drinkable
brew
not
exactly
like
the
german
berliner
weisses
that
i
have
had
but
a
nice
twist
that
i
enjoyed
pours
a
very
murky
yellow
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
nice
enough
retention
and
lacing
it
has
this
lemon
tangytart
smell
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
flavour
has
the
same
quite
unique
but
probably
fitting
for
the
style
love
the
carbonation
on
this
beer
makes
for
an
excellent
drinker
comments
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
and
i
am
really
impressed
with
the
style
it
definitely
deserves
the
title
napoleon
bestowed
upon
it
it
is
nice
to
see
a
respected
brewery
like
new
glarus
having
a
try
at
it
high
on
the
sour
fruity
linger
aspects
this
was
my
first
time
trying
a
berliner
weiss
i
hope
it
was
true
to
the
style
until
im
able
to
try
another
brewers
interpretation
of
this
very
distinctive
and
strange
beer
it
was
definetly
an
experience
d
really
tasty
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
night
the
smell
is
a
funky
yeast
yet
not
offputting
a
yellow
body
with
lots
of
white
head
a
little
tart
an
understated
lemoness
a
little
mineral
a
light
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
some
sweet
fruit
in
secondary
not
too
many
of
this
syle
about
and
worth
a
try
citric
green
apple
and
white
wine
finish
candidly
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
new
glarus
brews
this
one
however
is
just
wonderful
real
easy
to
drink
id
love
to
know
the
abv
of
this
very
light
and
very
fun
overall
such
a
fun
beer
id
like
to
have
more
beers
in
this
style
to
see
if
they
are
all
like
this
so
tasty
but
light
and
flavorful
as
the
bottle
says
perfect
for
a
summer
night
im
curious
where
this
one
will
go
with
some
more
age
i
am
a
fan
of
berliner
weissbiers
and
there
are
definitely
not
enough
of
them
brewed
glad
i
picked
up
a
bunch
of
these
before
they
were
gone
for
good
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
norm
every
once
in
a
while
the
body
was
good
light
and
crisp
and
was
perfect
for
my
after
dogwalk
beer
on
a
warm
spring
day
drinkability
was
very
good
id
have
23
of
these
in
a
row
too
bad
this
beer
isnt
being
brewed
any
more
id
like
more
ill
seek
out
other
examples
of
the
style
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
d
wish
i
had
more
of
this
to
figure
out
how
drinkable
it
truly
was
i
think
the
tartness
might
get
to
me
after
a
little
while
d
one
of
the
best
beers
that
ive
ever
had
across
any
style
this
one
really
is
a
winner
in
my
book
in
almost
every
way
nose
flavor
and
feel
are
so
clean
and
fresh
it
tastes
like
a
perfectly
crafted
tart
apple
cider
but
better
new
glarus
has
never
disappointed
but
this
beer
is
on
a
level
all
its
own
seek
it
out
its
amazing
i
am
a
fan
of
new
glarus
their
cherry
stout
is
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
cant
wait
to
get
some
raspberry
tart
but
this
beer
just
plain
sucked
too
me
like
watching
how
to
lose
a
guy
in
10
days
the
notebook
sleepless
in
seattle
and
any
freddy
prinze
jr
movie
all
in
the
same
day
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
slightly
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
fairly
tart
but
has
some
nice
fruit
flavors
in
it
pretty
good
beer
overall
4
5
d
tasty
brew
i
must
say
i
like
it
a
lot
but
unfortunately
this
will
likely
be
my
first
and
only
of
this
retired
brew
d
i
like
it
great
summer
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
explore
the
style
further
d
ya
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
during
the
hot
summer
months
well
i
have
had
2
new
glarus
beers
so
far
and
they
both
have
been
phenomenal
the
pour
is
a
light
golden
color
with
a
fairly
thin
head
that
is
well
retained
with
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
lemon
honey
and
a
bit
of
grape
the
taste
very
much
follows
the
nose
except
the
grape
is
stronger
than
the
honey
really
great
beer
thanks
to
jedwards
for
breaking
this
one
out
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
half
inch
bright
white
head
clarity
is
a
bit
hazy
head
dissipates
into
a
skim
that
coalesces
around
the
edges
nose
is
light
and
lemony
with
the
merest
suggestion
of
breadiness
taste
follows
nose
but
a
little
less
bready
clean
lemony
and
white
grapes
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
a
champagnelike
effervescence
and
a
clean
finish
a
really
nice
beer
flavorful
and
refreshing
i
just
wish
more
brewers
would
market
this
style
interesting
take
on
the
style
by
new
glarus
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
another
winner
from
new
glarus
a
great
aroma
nice
palate
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
weeknight
quite
easy
and
enjoyable
on
the
palate
despite
the
tart
though
i
feel
this
beer
is
starting
to
decline
slightly
still
a
solid
brew
pours
a
nice
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
twofinger
plus
foamy
white
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some

this

a
light

a
very
white
bubbly

that
settled
into
a
thin
cap
but
the
very
active
carbonation
was
visibly
present
for
the
entire
brew
the
aroma
is
very
sweet

white

some
hints
of
banana
light

sweet

man
the
tart
flavor
just
blows
up
in

this

i
was
very
lucky
to
get
it
in
a
mixed
unplugged
pack
from
my
bro
for
christmas
excellent
find
but
too
bad
retired
brew
the
unplugged
series
is
hit
or
miss
while
this
one
isnt
too
bad
it
isnt
a
stalwart
of
the
style
overall
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
love
to
have
again
easily

the
best

anywhere
made

excellent
d
an
extremely
drinkable

definitely
my
favorite
for
the

will
have
to
trek
back
up
to
wi
and
pray
that
i
can
find
some
more
of
this

i
really
dig
the

im
sad
this
is

im
glad
i
bought
a
handful
to
keep
in
the
cellar
d
as
usual
for
a
berliner
weiss
amazing
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
a
bunch
of
to
drink
during
the
warm
months
which
we
have
plenty
of
in
southern
california
a
great
beer
that
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
was
my
first
example
of
the
style
besides
dfh
festina
peche
and
i
really
love
this
beer
i
have
a
lot
of
it
was
only
made
once
and
my
wife
is
in
love
with
it
so
i
had
to
buy
plenty
of
it
when
i
could
find
it
a
really
solid
beer
and
a
style
i
want
to
explore
deeper

glarus
unplugged
berliner
wiess
poured
a
cloudy

the
taste
was
super

full

lemon
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thick
drinkability
was
nice
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
deal
wish
that
the
style
was
easier
to
find
d
another
great
new
glarus

i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
and
be
off
to
a
great
night
ill
have
to
seek
out
more
mouthfeel
is
extremely
light
thin

refreshing
this
is
a
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
nice
beer
its
a
very
interesting
combination
probably
not
classic
for
style
but
really
enjoyable
nonetheless

well
carbonated
the
perfect

overall
great

nice

great
beer
not
just
sour
but
funky
and
sweet
too
d
this
one
is
so
tart
on
the
first
sip
it
doesnt
seem
like
high
drinkability
could
really
be
a
quality
it
possesses
however
it
also
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
that
quickly
leads
to
watering
which
makes
taking
another
sip
an
imperative
each
drink
makes
me
want
more
damn
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
in
the
fridge
drinkability
maybe
a
bit
too
sour
to
be
sessionable
throwing
in
a
little
of
your
favorite
flavoring
syrup
might
help
out
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
this
would
be
intensely
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day

also
there
is
a
high

overall
a
decent
berliner

d
very
easy

i
should
have
bought
more
then
the
two
bottles
i
picked
up
in
the
sample
pack
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
after
the
last
bottle
is
finished
the
taste
is
whats
special
here
and
its
very
unique
it
is
a
tart
vinegar
at
first
but
upon
further
reflection
it
really
is
similar
to
eatting
a
granny
smith
apple
overall
its
a
great
taste
that
is
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
good
md
medium
bodied
and
lively
on
the
tongue
from
bountiful
carbonation
of
course
will
be
too
sour
for
some
but
it
is
quite
tasty
update
2010
this
is
the
champagne
of
bottled
beers
for
those
who
remember
that
ad
from
way
back
this
is
a
wonderful
refresher
for
those
hot
summer
days
but
also
would
work
with
heavier
fall
or
even
winter
meals
the
acidity
helping
to
cut
through
the
heavy
fats
the
a
idity
level
may
be
a
little
high
for
drinking
by
itself
for
too
long
but
i
could
definitely
have
one
with
salad
appetizer
and
entree
if
the
dessert
paired
well
i
couldtalk
myself
into
one
for
that
as
well
drinkability
is
stellar
im
not
sure
what
the
abv
on
this
is
but
i
cant
imagine
getting
tired
of
this
on
a
nice
hot
day
well
done
taste
mouthfeel
tart

dry
upfront
bready
and
wheaty
midpalate
tart
white

and

sharp
effervescence
and
a
light
body
make
for
one
ridiculously
refreshing
beer

and
crisp
finish
with
a
mild
lingering
sourness
this
is
an
exceptionally
good
american
take
on
this
undertheradar
style
awesome
a
really
drinkable
great
beer
ive
liked
just
about
everything
that
ive
tried
from
new
glarus
but
the
berliner
weiss
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
conclusion
im
definitely
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
we
paired
it
with
a
couple
of
different
crostini
peargorgonzola
and
brie
and
it
was
quite
nice
im
a
big
fan
of
1809
as
well
but
ngs
version
is
quite
different
instead
of
the
bright
citrus
and
chalkyyeasty
notes
the
addition
of
white
grapes
here
makes
this
one
light
and
champagnelike
a
treat
to
get
to
try
this
one
for
sure

exceptionally
dry
and
very
very
refreshing
although
i
must
say
it
is
not
as
complex
or
deep
as
id
hoped
d
freakishly
addicting
im
not
a

fan
but
this
is
fantastic

not
painfully
sour
though
its
crisp

clean
in
the
mouth
highly
carbonated
too
acidic
to
gulp
but
very
nice
id
like
to
try
more
in
the
style
now
you
know
why
i
grabbed
a
case
its
that
good
drinkability
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
this
is
an
excellent
brew
to
make
especially
with
no
hops
i
love
hops
but
i
have
also
fallen
in
love
with
this

to
it
mouthfeel
is
almost
medium
drinkable
and
moderately
refreshing
my
only
real
criticism
of
this
beer
is
that
its
not
a
regular
offering
might
be
a
good
competitor
for
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
and
a
little
more
appealing
to
craft
beer
fans
id
love
to
see
this
beer
make
it
into
new
glaruss
regular
seasonal
lineup
highly
drinkable
but
probably
too
expensive
to
session
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
jump
on
this
if
it
were
a
regular
release
d
well
this
would
be
a
great
go
to
beer
on
a
hot

night
as
is
delicous
d
this
is
a

i
think
it
could
use

is

eric
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
it
is
a
lot
sourer
than
i
expected
i
will
stick
to
one
of
these
for
the
night
and
move
onto
another
beer
after
this
one
nice
berliners
are
definitely
an
acquired
taste
but
this
one
does
a
great
job
of
keeping
things
tart
and
not
souring
crisp
fruity
and
very
quaffable
this
is
definitley
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
i
just
got
to
try
this
last
week
since
ive
read
its
retired
im
not
sure
how
i
was
able
to
buy
it
locally
ive
also
heard
from
my
husband
that
this
is
not
the
best
i
could
try
but
i
really
liked
it
d
i
can
handle
the
sourness
and
funky
tartness
but
barely
mere
mortals
might
not
be
able
to
finish
this
this
beer
came
from
unclejedi
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
color
is
a
cool
golden
orange
with
a
good
amount
of

tart
green
apples
get
things
started
in
the
smell
then
some
musty
notes
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
jolly
rancher
taste
is
a
perfect
mix
of
tart
and
sweet
again
some
green
apple
maybe
a
little
melon
flavor
as
the
label
indicates
there
is
a
nice
champagne
quality
to
it
in
the
body
it
is
wonderfully
crisp
refreshing
and
drinkable
a
great
summer
thirst
quencher
a
light
bodied
beer
i
could
sit
back
and
drink
this
all
day
new
glarus
cannot
do
any
wrong
in
my
book
i
only
wish
i
had
more
cheers
this
one
isnt
among
the
best
of
the
unplugged
lineup
but
it
is
a
solid
effort
at
a
style
you
dont
see
too
often
in
the
states
bravo
to
mr
carey
for
the
effort
berliner
weiss
isnt
the
best
beer
of
this
style
that
ive
ever
had
brauerei
weihenstephan
1809
holds
that
honor
its
still
a
decent
effort
but
that
old
dan
carey
magic
isnt
there
this
time
around
like
it
is
with
most
of
the
unplugged
beers
drinkability
well
that
was
tasty
certainly
not
a
straightup
textbook
representative
of
the
style
what
with
the
inclusion
of
white
wine
grapes
but
thats
why
its
properly
housed
in
the
unplugged
series
come
on
other
breweries
lets
see
some
berliner
weiss
out
there
they
dont
even
have
to
be
packed
with
grapes
really
poured
into
a
flute
glass
bright
yellow
but
a
shade
darker
than
your
bmc
lager
lively
carbonation
huge
head
even
with
a
slow
pour
it
could
be
the
temperature
pretty
chilled
but
theres
not
much
in
the
smell
sour
green
apples
lemon
some
wheat
a
little
musty
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
it
tasted
much
more
sour
than
it
smelled
i
cant
decide
if
its
more
of
a
lactic
or
acetic
sourness
but
the
vinegary
quality
is
subtle
hops
are
imperceptable
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sour
fruit
reminds
me
of
green
apples
and
pear
the
most
but
definitely
some
lemony
citrus
in
there
too
the
beer
ends
with
a
subtle
taste
of
wheat
really
dry
very
similar
to
cider
or
champagne
mediumlight
bodied
i
could
definitely
do
more
than
one
of
these
but
the
sourness
prevents
it
from
being
a
highly
drinkable
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
d
only
my
third
example
of
a
berliner
weiss
but
the
best
one
i
have
had
by
far
this
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
one
that
kept
me
interested
for
sure
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
d
not
an
overly
drinkable
style
given
the
sourness
levels
this
one
isnt
quite
as
sour
as
im
used
to
ends
up
making
it
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
great
summer
time
beer
sitting
outside
in
the
warm
weather
wow
this
one
blew
me
away
way
beyond
my
expectations
this
is
by
far
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
tried
yet
i
only
regret
not
buying
two
four
packs
on
my
recent
trip
i
cant
drink
the
hell
out
of
beers
like
this
but
i
do
like
them
and
this
one
is
another
in
the
unplugged
series
that
is
uniquely
superior
and
enjoyable
a
very
nice
take
on
a
berliner
d
this
is
a
very
nice
berliner
weiss
the
tartness
was
not
to
strong
no
to
weak
and
there
was
a
good
complexity
to
the
flavor
with
some
wild
notes
in
there
aswell
as
fruit
and
the
bit
of
hops
really
complimented
the
other
flavors
d
my
girlriend
and
i
both
agree
that
we
could
kick
these
back
all
night
tried
a
bottle
with
a
himbeere
style
syrup
well
actually
my
grandmothers
raspberry
marmalade
something
she
made
and
puts
in
her
tea
interesting
to
say
the
least
just
a
little
bit
gave
it
a
grassy
note
and
the
sugar
interaction
is
quite
pleasant
wouldnt
be
surprised
in
someone
comes
out
with
something
similar
to
the
feste
peche
but
with
raspberries
in
the
near
future
blipped
the
drunk
song
by
ich
bin
ein
berliner
d
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
was
kinda
scared
to
try
it
but
i
wound
up
really
enjoying
it
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
the
four
pack
instead
of
a
single
flavor
starts
off
with
a
quick
sweet
note
of
grape
juice
and
wheat
before
the
tart
sets
in
and
oh
what
a
tart
it
is
sour
white
grapes
lemon
peel
and
granny
smith
apples
all
combine
to
pucker
the
back
and
sides
of
the
mouth
but
thankfully
the
acidity
doesnt
seem
to
wear
out
the
palate
give
this
one
some
time
and
allow
its
complexities
to
unfold
across
the
palateit
will
reward
your
patience
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
dry
and
extremely
carbonated
just
as
a
good
weissbier
should
be
as
ive
come
to
realize
new
glarus
has
the
incredible
knack
for
taking
a
lesser
known
andor
underrated
style
and
producing
a
beer
that
exceeds
expectations
unplugged
berliner
weiss
is
no
exception
pours
a
straw
yellowwheat
like
look
with
a
decent
head
and
lacing
its
nice
the
smell
is
apple
and
melon
somewhat
tart
i
detect
malt
clove
and
hops
also
secondary
the
taste
is
of
a
fruity
belgian
ale
it
hits
you
with
apple
and
melon
somewhat
champagne
in
taste
but
good
it
fills
the
mouth
with
a
belgian
like
taste
with
a
little
hop
spice
and
malt
to
round
things
out
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
more
than
once
and
i
really
liked
it
i
will
buy
some
singles
as
long
as
its
around
drinkability
this
would
be
perfect
in
the
summer
on
a
hot
night
it
is
complex
light
and
interesting
sip
after
sip
a
perfect
session
beer
drank
with
whiterascal
d
ive
got
a
fever
and
the
only
prescription
is
more
tartness
tart
tart
and
puckery
that
is
the
best
description
for
this
beer
a
nice
straw
colored
beer
with
low
alcohol
could
use
a
shot
of
woodruff
syrup
to
balance
out
the
acidic
pallette
definitely
not
a
beer
that
you
will
drink
a
lot
of
if
you
like
sour
lambics
than
you
will
enjoy
this
tart
acidic
german
wheat
very
light
and
drinkable
just
not
very
beer
like
i
could
see
pairing
it
with
some
pasta
with
a
cream
sauce
d
thanks
to
imperialking
for
the
chance
to
try
this
it
was
perfectly
sessionable
i
wish
i
had
a
lot
more
another
unplugged
beer
that
did
not
disappoint
i
have
not
had
many
beers
of
this
style
but
this
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
would
like
to
drink
again
highly
sessionable
too
recommended
d
great
drinkability
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
keep
it
coming
great
wellcrafted
beer
with
lots
of
character
single
bottle
either
sent
by
dirts
or
smuggled
back
quite
drinkable
when
its
this
tasty
its
always
quite
drinkable
hazy
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
skim
of
bright
white
bubbles
and
a
soapy
collar
good
head
retention
for
whats
there
bit
of
stickiness
aromas
of
tart
apples
raw
wheat
floral
honey
crackers
earthy
light
sourness
and
a
hint
of
yeast
and
spice
light
bodied
with
medium
plus
carbonation
quite
dry
nearly
creamy
texture
lots
of
fruity
tartness
up
front
lots
of
apple
character
here
some
sour
lemony
wheat
midpalate
along
with
mild
breadiness
then
a
hint
of
salt
towards
the
end
tart
from
start
to
finish
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
room
for
other
flavours
very
refreshing
pours
a
semitransparent
pale
yellow
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
thin
but
patchy
netting
banana
runts
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
in
the
aroma
category
a
little
sweet
lemon
skin
and
subtle
mint
leaves
alive
this
beer
is
an
eye
opener
lots
of
tiny
bright
carbonation
bubbles
bring
the
tartness
and
feel
of
acidity
of
this
beer
to
life
its
very
lemonsour
not
so
much
sour
patch
kids
sour
if
that
makes
any
sense
im
enjoying
every
sip
light
bodied
but
very
coating
on
the
mouth
most
especially
the
back
of
the
throat
outstanding
beer
nonetheless
i
loved
it
and
would
highly
recommend
it
light
to
medium
light
body
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
im
not
very
familiar
with
berliner
weissbiers
but
if
this
is
any
indicator
of
what
to
expect
i
need
to
try
some
more
this
is
very
delicious
i
cant
stop
taking
sips
almost
addictive
in
that
regard
consequently
this
beer
is
crazy
style
drinkable
i
fear
four
bottles
just
wont
cut
it
and
sadly
this
will
be
off
store
shelves
fore
long
definiately
not
a
session
beer
unless
you
like
sourtartbitter
beers
for
me
its
the
benchmark
of
the
style
and
i
wish
more
breweries
would
make
attempts
at
this
given
the
2008
hop
shortage
d
due
to
the
bitter
nature
of
the
beer
this
does
drink
a
bit
slower
then
other
styles
but
still
very
easy
to
drink
while
im
very
glad
ive
gotten
to
try
all
these
new
glarus
takes
on
german
styles
im
getting
the
sense
that
theyre
not
really
my
thing
i
guess
i
better
not
move
to
germany
any
time
soon
is
tell
anyone
with
an
interest
in
the
funk
to
get
this
its
super
nice
pours
out
a
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
gigantic
white
head
that
laces
nicely
smells
like
a
field
of
wheat
touched
with
slight
a
orange
spiciness
notes
of
lemon
and
a
funky
off
odor
as
well
taste
is
a
huge
smack
in
the
face
very
fruity
upfront
followed
by
a
huge
tartness
that
lingers
into
lemony
sour
notes
some
grassywheat
going
on
in
it
as
well
very
nice
taste
starts
like
a
radler
and
finishes
like
a
lemonhead
this
is
one
ridiculous
brew
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
wish
it
was
50
degrees
warmer
right
now
drinkability
something
a
little
bit
different
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
anything
from
new
glarus
is
worth
a
try
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
champange
like
head
that
leaves
no
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
very
sweet
with
a
tangy
tart
like
smell
and
also
a
bit
of
slight
cascade
smell
taste
is
simply
amazing
with
a
tarty
carbonated
sour
taste
to
it
that
goes
down
very
smooth
this
beer
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
has
such
a
high
drinkablity
which
is
simply
simply
impressive
d
i
find
this
to
be
a
really
good
berliner
its
a
shame
it
was
only
released
once
because
this
would
make
a
nice
mildly
tart
session
ale
very
good
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
so
far
overall
a
fantastic
offering
in
the
unplugged
series
completely
refreshing
with
a
nice
lemon
tartness
d
this
is
a
great
weiss
beer
but
the
sourness
is
too
much
to
rate
it
any
higher
good
for
style
beer
md
light
and
crisp
very
lively
in
the
mouth
due
to
very
high
carbonation
not
overcabonated
in
anyway
though
incredibly
refreshing
and
drinkable
temptation
overall
this
is
different
from
anything
ive
ever
tried
and
it
is
great
if
you
love
beer
but
also
have
an
affinity
for
white
whine
or
champagne
i
suggest
you
find
this
however
you
can
even
if
youre
not
that
big
on
champagne
you
should
try
this
brew
its
an
experience
i
love
new
glarus
and
as
much
as
i
wish
they
distributed
to
minnesota
the
fact
that
they
dont
makes
it
a
special
occasion
each
time
i
have
one
748416
3
95
new
glarus
is
a
great
brewery
and
i
will
continue
to
try
everything
they
make
but
this
one
did
not
work
for
me
i
guess
maybe
i
dont
like
the
style
until
i
read
the
description
on
the
bottle
after
we
drank
it
i
thought
maybe
it
had
been
infected
had
a
hard
time
drinking
this
bottle
from
brigadier
thanks
man
pour
is
a
hazy
golden
with
a
big
fizz
white
head
aroma
is
a
zesty
lemon
grapes
and
wine
like
flavor
is
very
lively
and
tart
but
not
sour
very
dry
nicely
carbonated
and
refreshing
would
be
a
great
brew
for
a
summer
day
ive
had
very
little
exposure
to
the
berliner
weiss
but
ive
really
enjoyed
the
ones
ive
tried
i
love
the
style
and
the
fact
that
there
can
be
so
much
complexity
to
a
beer
this
light
bodied
and
with
such
low
abv
lemon
tart
acidity
weighs
in
right
away
not
quite
puckering
but
assertively
and
refreshingly
tart
lemon
peel
mixes
with
granny
smith
apple
sweettart
midpalate
sourdough
wheat
backbone
finishes
with
a
little
lemonade
sweetness
accompanied
by
the
tartness
deliciously
refreshing
with
a
light
body
and
lively
effervescence
would
be
really
nice
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
received
in
trade
from
buckeyenation
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
thanks
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
very
little
head
smells
like
lemon
icebox
pie
tart
lemon
lemon
zest
and
sweet
creamy
meringue
the
taste
is
remarkably
true
to
the
aromas
more
lemon
fruit
zest
and
sweet
cream
just
like
a
lemon
icebox
pie
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
on
the
creamy
side
rather
than
the
tart
side
and
although
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
for
me
its
a
bit
too
creamy
for
the
style
i
like
my
berliner
weisses
a
good
deal
zestier
and
more
tart
and
acidic
drinkability
outstanding
i
picked
up
a
4
pack
of
this
stuff
just
because
it
said
new
glarus
and
unplugged
turns
out
its
pretty
much
the
most
quaffable
beer
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
i
love
wild
ales
and
this
is
sort
of
a
badass
morphling
of
one
i
guess
hell
i
dont
know
its
freaking
good
though
thank
the
lord
im
hitting
up
new
glarus
soon
and
can
grab
more
than
my
fair
share
of
this
damn
i
almost
wish
i
had
not
tried
this
one
makes
me
sad
now
that
i
only
got
one
bottle
absolutley
my
favorite
beer
of
the
last
few
weeks
and
one
of
the
best
of
any
style
i
have
ever
had
i
would
just
absolutley
love
to
get
ahold
of
this
one
again
any
day
very
well
executed
one
of
the
most
drinkable
styles
out
there
in
my
opinion
golden
pour
with
no
orange
hints
lively
and
passively
foamy
sweet
lemon
tartness
in
the
aroma
is
unmistakable
at
first
then
layers
of
fresh
strawberry
spring
fauna
and
dry
white
wine
follow
through
insanely
drinkable
with
lightness
and
fizz
big
on
tart
flavor
up
front
prosecco
comes
to
mind
immediately
finishing
oaky
with
a
pronounced
yet
controlled
lactic
smoothness
this
beer
delivers
what
festina
peche
attempted
and
halfdid
right
i
wish
it
was
still
warm
out
id
be
seeking
this
out
by
the
case
nice
and
clean
wheat
on
the
finish
grassy
slightly
herbal
some
pear
some
other
citrus
aspects
a
perfect
summer
beer
maybe
drinkability
my
first
berliner
weissbier
makes
it
difficult
to
judge
against
others
of
th
style
while
it
was
quite
tasty
i
cant
say
i
would
seek
another
one
out
soon
unusual
and
enjoyable
something
different
which
is
nice
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
it
exceeded
on
all
accounts
ill
try
to
dig
up
some
more
of
this
when
i
get
back
to
wisconsin
over
the
holidays
what
a
wonderful
beer
d
one
fine
example
of
this
quintessentially
drinkable
style
after
some
leafraking
this
mild
november
afternoon
this
was
a
perfect
quencher
im
thankful
for
buddies
like
mnwagsmetalmonk
for
sending
even
more
thankful
for
a
second
bottle
courtesy
rorygilmore
very
nice
job
by
new
glarus
and
definitely
recommended
d
i
have
not
many
beer
of
this
style
so
this
is
somewhat
of
a
learning
experience
or
a
palate
experience
i
like
the
sourness
and
i
also
like
the
fact
i
could
pair
this
with
a
nice
chicken
dish
or
seafood
if
i
wasnt
allergic
and
it
really
hitting
the
spot
i
love
this
style
and
wish
they
were
more
abundant
nothing
better
than
a
berliner
weiss
on
a
hot
summer
day
so
drinkable
my
favorite
is
still
festina
peche
though
maybe
that
will
change
when
i
have
an
1809
this
weekend
mouthfeel
is
light
and
just
barely
there
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
id
drink
a
4pack
every
day
cheers
a
delicious
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
hope
will
grow
beyond
wisconsin
new
glarus
is
definitely
on
my
short
list
of
top
american
brewers
outside
my
region
a
great
example
of
an
up
and
coming
style
ive
had
very
little
experience
with
this
style
and
was
not
expecting
the
tartness
to
this
extent
it
was
good
but
not
one
ill
go
back
to
often
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
it
finishes
on
the
sour
side
with
some
light
spiciness
and
the
head
retention
and
lacing
superb
new
glarus
brews
always
seem
to
have
that
trait
at
least
in
the
brews
of
theirs
that
i
tried
another
winner
here
ultimately
new
glarus
berliner
weiss
would
fit
right
at
home
in
northern
germany
its
briny
salty
and
citrusy
taste
begs
for
more
than
just
sauerbraten
wheres
the
mussels
mouthfeel
is
light
and
biting
drinks
very
easily
superb
thirst
quencher
super
drinkability
a
damn
good
take
on
the
style
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
good
beer
if
youre
into
sour
beers
not
sure
i
could
drink
to
many
of
them
in
a
row
though
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
interesting
to
say
the
least
has
a
champagne
consistency
with
a
dry
wine
flavor
overall
strange
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
most
drinkable
berliner
weiss
ive
ever
had
likely
alcohol
is
just
fine
and
its
not
overwhelmingly
tart
overwhelmingly
dry
overwhelmingly
anything
its
just
a
perfectly
pleasant
beer
recommended
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
beer
with
a
fizzy
white
head
with
minimal
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
tart
note
is
dominating
taste
is
also
dominated
by
tart
note
with
some
light
sour
peak
full
body
with
average
carbonation
i
thought
this
was
very
refreshing
and
tart
but
not
in
an
extreme
manner
which
means
i
would
like
to
have
this
has
a
session
beer
more
regularly
easily
the
best
american
attempt
at
a
berliner
weisse
ive
had
so
far
can
new
glarus
do
wrong
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
there
was
a
decent
sized
white
head
on
it
that
dropped
off
rather
quickly
milder
aroma
but
what
is
there
is
nice
notes
of
tart
fruits
and
actually
a
bit
of
a
white
wine
note
also
the
flavor
is
a
little
tart
and
dry
fruit
notes
apple
mainly
a
little
spiciness
and
once
again
an
almost
white
wine
flavor
in
there
also
this
is
really
good
good
stuff
this
was
truly
a
unique
version
of
a
unique
style
of
beer
new
glarus
really
pushed
the
envelope
with
this
release
and
came
up
with
a
winner
once
again
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
again
although
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
it
just
like
a
dry
white
wine
cold
the
sharp
sourness
of
this
beer
hts
hard
almost
gueuzelike
quite
nice
the
effect
mellows
a
bit
as
it
warms
and
vinous
notes
come
through
wheaty
graininess
as
well
a
very
crisp
and
tart
brew
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
or
a
with
food
it
would
have
been
more
fun
to
drink
this
from
a
stemmed
glass
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
champagne
of
the
north
moniker
thanks
again
to
maximum12
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
and
if
you
see
this
around
be
sure
to
give
it
a
shot
m
d
a
bit
of
pucker
and
a
nice
drying
on
the
finish
soft
medium
body
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
id
like
to
look
into
the
style
further
quite
good
and
recommended
d
i
like
this
but
i
think
one
is
my
limit
thanks
highly
quaffable
there
are
no
faults
that
i
can
detect
in
fact
this
beer
improves
upon
the
berliner
weisse
tradition
german
examples
for
this
beer
are
often
so
sour
that
syrup
must
be
added
not
so
with
this
beer
excellent
this
is
yet
another
winner
from
new
glarus
hopefully
we
can
see
a
lot
more
berliner
weiss
styled
beers
come
along
here
in
the
near
future
i
have
to
give
a
nod
to
new
glarus
for
yet
another
unique
beer
with
the
use
of
pinot
grapes
to
add
more
depth
very
nice
light
and
refreshing
sharply
acidic
and
sour
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
or
hoppiness
a
great
session
beer
right
on
the
spot
for
the
style
d
12
124pak
is
really
expensive
maybe
its
that
im
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
i
drank
one
and
gave
the
other
3
away
had
a
hard
time
drinking
the
whole
beer
i
like
new
glarus
products
but
this
one
does
nothing
for
me
except
make
me
want
to
stay
away
from
it
nice
and
refreshing
sour
without
being
funky
nice
different
beer
on
a
hot
day
d
amazingly
drinkable
great
flavor
and
body
and
such
a
great
example
of
the
style
probably
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
d
im
surprised
my
wife
allowed
me
to
share
this
one
with
her
because
she
loves
berliner
weiss
and
she
only
brought
back
a
4pack
from
new
glarus
outstanding
effort
its
a
shame
this
is
a
onceanddone
brew
id
definitely
pick
this
one
up
often
at
least
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
and
they
produced
it
regularly
poured
into
a
wine
glass
bright
yellow
with
a
bubbly
head
and
nice
carbonation
aroma
of
sour
grapes
and
a
sweet
underlying
note
taste
of
sweet
tart
grapes
lemon
peel
very
citrusy
slightly
dry
and
very
refreshing
nice
balance
between
the
crisp
dry
flavor
and
creamy
mouthfeel
my
first
of
this
style
and
i
dig
it
sour
beers
are
quickly
becoming
some
of
my
favorites
pours
light
golden
with
a
light
white
head
aroma
is
nice
barnyard
funk
sour
and
light
fruitiness
flavor
is
refreshing
and
tart
with
a
light
earthy
undertone
that
adds
a
little
complexity
finishes
clean
and
tart
and
makes
it
hard
to
stop
drinking
solid
brew
must
get
more
dif
this
kind
of
beer
is
your
thing
you
will
likely
enjoy
this
seems
to
have
the
qualities
i
expected
with
some
interesting
touches
with
the
grapes
and
oaky
notes
ovr
though
not
my
favorite
unplugged
good
refreshing
and
a
unique
flavor
for
me
it
tastes
like
a
yeasty
sparkling
pinot
grigio
with
some
sourness
mixed
in
tastes
very
very
similar
to
dfh
festina
peche
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
definitely
one
of
germanys
most
exotic
styles
and
this
one
by
new
glarus
is
a
fantastic
interpretation
as
close
to
fine
champagne
as
beer
will
get
track
it
down
before
its
gone
forevernew
glarus
unplugged
beers
are
brewed
once
with
no
promise
theyll
ever
be
brewed
again
too
bad
as
id
love
to
see
this
one
year
round
pours
a
mildly
hazey
sunshine
straw
very
light
yet
bright
white
lacing
that
disappears
rather
quickly
very
light
and
small
bubbling
very
clear
pinot
grigio
and
pilsner
malt
bill
the
taste
is
a
dry
malt
bill
with
some
tart
dry
wine
grapes
and
a
touch
of
some
of
those
sweeter
riesling
grapes
the
palate
is
a
vibrant
tartness
with
unripened
green
apple
skins
this
bee
really
envigorates
the
senses
great
wake
up
beer
pours
a
somewhat
murky
pale
yellow
hue
with
a
chunky
bubbled
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
some
spotty
lacing
but
not
a
whole
lot
smell
is
light
and
fruity
grapes
apricots
and
lemongrass
an
interesting
but
fitting
leather
aroma
finds
its
way
in
the
nose
as
well
a
unique
aroma
for
sure
but
one
i
enjoy
taste
begins
very
tart
with
white
grapes
and
crisp
sour
apples
sweet
wheat
with
honey
and
sugar
midway
on
the
tongue
aftertaste
is
very
puckering
with
an
acidic
lemon
flavor
light
and
crisp
body
with
a
strong
and
lively
carbonation
very
refreshing
for
this
warm
out
of
season
september
night
in
syracuse
i
could
see
why
some
wouldnt
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
love
it
a
perfect
summer
brew
for
sure
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
festina
peche
which
is
the
only
other
of
the
style
that
ive
had
but
this
one
is
leaps
and
bounds
above
dogfish
heads
offering
a
great
beer
experience
for
sure
glad
i
have
a
few
more
to
enjoy
thanks
to
deuane
for
bringing
this
back
from
wi
pours
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
tumbler
of
the
same
size
wow
pours
like
7up
very
effervescent
appears
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
good
three
fingers
of
white
foam
that
quickly
dwindles
down
to
about
half
an
inch
or
so
aroma
is
of
citrus
fruits
and
is
a
bit
bready
with
some
grapes
thrown
in
for
good
measure
taste
is
nicely
tart
with
flavors
of
lemon
wheat
apple
and
grape
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
moderate
carbonation
over
the
past
two
summers
this
style
has
quickly
become
my
favorite
thirst
quenching
goto
beer
check
it
out
if
you
have
the
chance
i
have
to
admit
this
beer
is
truly
unique
i
will
definitely
pick
up
another
four
pack
this
is
a
great
brew
to
sip
and
relax
with
i
am
not
used
to
this
style
but
it
is
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
pretty
drinkable
sadly
i
dont
have
any
others
thanks
to
asmokingoat
for
the
bottle
pours
a
very
light
golden
hue
with
a
thin
head
on
top
this
beer
is
lively
and
the
name
champagne
of
the
north
is
indeed
quite
fitting
an
effervescent
nose
with
apple
sourness
hild
hoppiness
and
grassy
notes
tastes
pretty
good
a
nice
rounded
sourness
to
it
with
some
hoppiness
as
well
and
with
apple
flavors
predominant
a
nice
crisp
and
somewhat
clinging
feel
that
goes
into
a
long
seductive
apple
finish
with
the
sourness
becoming
smoother
nothing
too
special
but
a
solid
job
by
new
glarus
and
an
enjoyable
and
quirky
beer
no
doubt

finishes
short
tart
and
very
dry
another
great
beer
from
new
glarus
thanks
jed
the
light
body
makes
this
beer
easy
to
finish
however
the
tartness
and
the
sourness
make
it
more
of
a
challenge
to
open
a
second
bottle
d
the
ale
tastes
heavy
and
active
but
isnt
terribly
strong
this
is
a
style
that
shouldnt
go
the
way
of
the
dodo
so
im
glad
to
see
new
glarus
give
it
proper
treatment
d
this
one
begs
to
be
drank
in
number
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
sure
how
strong
it
is
but
seems
quite
sessionable
this
is
my
first
time
trying
a
berliner
weiss
but
ill
make
it
a
point
to
grab
another
sometime
soon
a
great
example
of
an
endangered
style
yet
another
wonderful
unplugged
overall
a
perfect
berliner
weiss
imho
balanced
but
still
tart
citrusy
and
soft
clean
and
tangy
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
case
of
this
but
my
remaining
three
will
be
cherished
great
job
mr
dan
carey
drinkability

mostly
a

flavor
sour
but
very
refreshing
wonderful
crisp

effervescent
leaves
a
light
fruity
aftertaste
i
really
would
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
night
highly
carbonated
head
that
you
can
hear
crackle
across
the
room
after
pouring
settles
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
light
straw
appearance
the
nose
isnt
giving
up
too
much
some
lemon
and
a
little
funk
that
i
cant
describe
the
taste
in
a
word
lemons
with
a
winelike
acidic
kick
that
slides
along
the
sides
of
your
mouth
the
flavors
last
pretty
long
on
your
palate
very
refreshing
and
invites
you
back
quickly
for
another
sip
glad
i
bought
a
4pack
to
try
this
is
a
very
unique
style
although
i
doubt
i
will
run
out
for
more
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
humid
day
update

been
a
while
since
i
had
the
original
but
based
on
previous
review
the
new
riesling
only
version
seems
to
have
more
winegrape
notes
to
it
still
really
tasty
especially
on
warm
summer
day
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
rather
weak
there
is
some
green
apple
but
not
much
else
the
taste
has
a
nice
sourness
with
lots
of
green
apple
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
berliner
weiss
i
would
like
to
get
more
in
the
nose
but
it
is
drinkable
nonetheless
picked
up
a
4
pack
over
the
border
to
give
this
style
a
try
since
new
glarus
makes
excellent
wheat
beers
it
was
definitely
an
interesting
experience
probably
the
dryest
beer
ive
ever
had
the
tart
and
sour
citrus
was
a
first
for
me
in
a
beer
drinkability
is
great
the
brew
is
mellow
and
easygoing
but
there
is
enough
active
flavor
here
for
most
palates
to
enjoy
essentially
a
mellow
version
of
a
flemish
sour
this
brew
remains
refreshing
and
light
bodied
cheers
mark
my
words
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
this
style
becomes
widely
popular
how
can
it
not
it
is
refreshingly
tart
enjoyably
funky
shares
characteristics
with
already
popular
wines
and
lends
itself
to
mixing
with
syrups
thanks
to
new
glarus
many
on
this
continent
are
already
no
longer
strangers
in
the
ways
of

a

thanks
scott
mouthfeel
is
light
and
arid
with
steady
fast
moving
carbonation
it
does
almost
seem
champagne
like
as
it
goes
down
i
could
see
this
being
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
beach
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
havent
had
many
berliner
weiss
beers
before
but
i
do
enjoy
this
one
with
its
solid
tartsour
kick
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
very
sessionable
as
well
d
poundable
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
color
of
pale
brass
slightly
cloudy
in
appearance
a
good
but
not
longlasting
head
aroma
has
vague
funk
good
a
hint
of
oxidation
which
i
always
get
from
this
style
so
i
doubt
its
really
oxidation
im
detecting
in
any
case
not
really
a
problem
great
sourtart
flavor
hints
of
lemon
sour
but
very
clean
finish
though
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
this
style
id
say
it
was
pretty
good
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
berliner
weiss
damn
near
perfect
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
insanely
drinkable
on
this
warm
summers
day
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
the
wine
enthusiast
as
well
as
to
showcase
the
variety
of
flavours
possible
in
beer
also
highly
recommended
for
those
interested
in
trying
some
tart
brews
although
the
grapes
really
balance
the
tartness
quite
nicely
i
would
love
to
see
this
brew
every
summer
as
it
is
such
a
pleasant
somewhat
crisp
and
highly
refreshing
drink
get
it
while
you
can
lemon
yellow
sun
to
quote
eddie
vedder
hazy
thin
dirty
white
head
dissipates
to
a
thin
collar
and
the
lace
is
sporadic
nice
aroma
of
lime
grape
juice
barrel
funk
and
lemon
rind
starts
with
a
definite
tart
presence
but
it
gets
washed
away
rather
quickly
with
a
front
of
sweet
lemon
drops
and
grapes
the
reisling
character
appears
throughout
with
a
soft
sweetness
but
tart
crisp
wheat
character
presides
and
is
the
main
player
im
no
expert
on
this
style
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good
its
refreshing
and
intricate
pours
pale
golden
with
excellent
clarity
and
two
finger
snow
white
head
and
good
lacing
nose
faint
wheat
malt
and
noticeable
white
grapes
taste
grapes
and
oak
initially
white
a
dry
tart
finish
the
grain
from
the
wheat
malt
is
strong
in
the
finish
citrus
and
sprtizy
on
the
palate
as
well
not
overly
complex
but
refreshing
an
interesting
beer
with
the
grape
influence
i
would
not
really
characterize
this
as
a
berliner
weiss
i
really
wonder
what
the
alcohol
is
on
this
as
it
at
least
drinks
a
little
bigger
than
your
typical
example
of
the
style
this
is
by
no
means
a
big
beer
though
but
i
do
wish
a
bit
more
wild
complexity
and
funkiness
came
through
rather
than
the
grape
flavors
which
are
quite
expressive
i
must
admit
though
that
the
flavors
that
the
grapes
contribute
are
quite
nice
it
is
just
i
was
expecting
a
reasonable
facsimile
of
a
berliner
weiss
given
the
name
of
this
beer
and
this
has
definitely
moved
in
another
albeit
derivative
direction
still
ill
happily
consume
share
my
other
bottles
of
this
brew
initially
i
felt
this
was
a
good
thirstquencher
and
gulped
it
down
the
alcohol
content
though
not
listed
seems
to
be
relatively
low
i
drank
two
bottles
but
the
tartness
became
cloying
to
me
on
the
second
bottle
ive
had
new
glarus
take
on
sour
brown
ale
and
was
pleased
but
i
feel
this
one
could
use
a
little
more
than
sourness
to
keep
it
interesting
despite
using
two
kinds
of
grapes
wheat
malt
and
5
kinds
of
yeast
according
to
the
label
it
ultimately
seems
onedimensional
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
and
i
probably
will
to
get
more
acquainted
with
this
style
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
could
enjoy
these
all
day
long
on
nice
summer
day
while
bbqing
with
friends
family
this
blows
me
away
but
i
guess
its
no
surprise
that
new
glarus
would
pull
out
another
wheated
trump
card
havent
had
many
of
this
style
but
this
must
be
one
of
the
best
its
crazy
its
tart
but
its
damn
good
new
glarus
can
really
work
wonders
with
fruit

woohoo
only
took
a
couple
months
because
it
is
a
rare
bier
please
go
out
and
find
one
of
these
and
enjoy
clear
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
somewhat
sour
but
also
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
white
wine
had
some
lemon
as
well
as
some
bread
notes
seems
to
have
a
touch
of
oak
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
however
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
actually
saw
any
oak
in
addtion
to
the
aforementioned
oak
it
also
has
tastes
of
lemons
grapes
without
the
skin
and
sour
dough
bread
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
an
easily
drinkable
beer
that
is
great
for
the
summer
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
touch
but
still
cool
im
a
fan
of
sours
and
this
beer
is
sour
very
lemony
light
and
drinkable

this
beer
really
delivers
a
perfect
summer
sipper
overall
this
is
a
very
sour
berliner
weisse
for
fans
of
puckering
sour
beers
only
for
this
is
one
of
the
most
intense
ive
had
overall
berliner
weissbiers
i
usually
think
of
as
a
gateway
to
sour
beers
this
one
is
easy
an
exception
it
is
intensely
sour
but
the
flavors
are
so
strong
and
complex
this
is
a
must
have
for
all
who
like
sour
beers
and
the
style
pours
an
extremely
pale
straw
color
with
no
head
but
still
appropriately
carbonated
the
aroma
is
very
tart
smelling
nice
lactic
aroma
lemony
and
tangy
delicious
beer
very
lactic
and
tangy
with
lemon
and
yogurt
flavors
creamy
and
tart
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonation
excellent
beer
hazy
pale
straw
topped
with
a
minimal
wispy
white
head
that
vanishes
leaving
the
beer
looking
rather
still
smells
like
bigtime
acetic
lactic
lemon
flavor
is
sour
like
warheads
sour
lactic
acidic
crisp
lemon
juice
tartness
that
obscures
whatever
other
flavors
might
be
trying
to
poke
through
dont
get
me
wrong
this
was
fun
to
try
i
enjoyed
it
like
i
do
overly
spicy
food
its
just
one
great
big
sour
kick
in
the
teeth
without
any
grainy
wheat
for
depth
light
crisp
puckering
too
intensely
acidic
and
one
dimensional
for
the
style
and
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
maybe
10
oz
expensive
too
which
in
addition
to
the
crushing
sourness
makes
the
whole
thing
seem
more
of
a
novelty
than
a
truly
sessionable
berliner
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
love
this
beer
try
it
whenever
and
however
you
get
a
chance
o
not
bad
but
not
a
great
representation
of
the
style
had
a
10
oz
pour
with
dinner
mouth
feel
was
sharp
and
tart
light
hazy
yellow
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
flavors
were
of
lemon
and
straw
very
dry
there
is
no
malt
in
the
flavor
at
all
it
is
all
about
the
tartness
like
a
very
dry
wine
went
well
with
my
pork
loin
with
a
cherry
sauce
a
classic
german
sour
wow
was
like
drinking
liquid
lemon
heads
in
a
good
way
smelled
extremely
tart
and
lemony
and
tasted
the
same
extremely
mouth
puckeringly
tart
with
very
powerful
acidic
and
sweet
lemon
favors
just
how
i
like
my
berliners
overly
tart
one
draft
of
this
is
enough
for
but
boy
was
it
good
wave
after
wave
of
tart
acidic
candied
lemons
but
was
still
refreshing
would
love
to
have
again
one
of
the
sourest
most
acidic
beers
ive
ever
had
a
10
ounce
pour
of
this
was
close
to
way
too
much
for
me
as
a
sour
beer
or
as
something
different
i
like
it
a
lot
but
as
a
berliner
its
terrible
berliners
are
tart
session
what
beers
there
is
nothing
sessionable
about
this
beer
from
bear
republic
its
blonde
and
sour
as
the
come
clear
and
with
a
little
body
the
head
is
soapy
white
and
an
inch
tall
but
its
dead
in
just
seconds
and
the
beer
appears
still
at
that
point
the
nose
on
it
is
caustic
lactic
acidity
and
wheat
malt
simple
but
enormously
sour
the
flavor
is
the
same
extremely
one
dimensional
and
that
dimension
is
sourness
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
will
score
highly
with
sour
lovers
and
i
like
it
in
that
context
but
its
an
over
the
top
berliner
for
me
and
was
hard
to
get
through
frankly
a
medium
body
too
seems
big
but
its
slippery
on
the
palate
prickly
and
stinging
from
the
acidity
like
sucking
on
a
lemon
wedge
times
ten
at
8
or
9
bucks
a
pour
down
at
hops
and
pie
once
was
enough
for
me
it
hurt
my
stomach
and
sent
it
somersaulting
for
hours
i
appreciate
it
respect
it
and
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
its
just
too
much
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
bright
yellow
color
mostly
clear
hardly
any
head
whatsoever
aroma
is
indicative
that
this
will
be
tart
vinegar
and
i
could
almost
swear
a
note
of
tartar
sauce
but
that
could
be
the
power
of
suggestion
the
flavor
is
extremely
sour
lemons
and
vinegar
it
didnt
taste
bad
but
i
have
never
had
a
berliner
that
was
this
sour
most
of
the
berliner
weisse
beers
i
have
tasted
are
only
mildly
tart
if
you
are
looking
for
a
palate
crushing
sour
than
look
no
further
but
i
felt
this
deviated
a
little
too
far
from
the
style
o
to
me
this
hits
on
all
that
i
expect
and
want
from
the
style
being
a
relatively
newer
style
to
me
my
palate
might
evolve
but
for
now
this
gets
a
high
rating
o
this
is
spot
on
for
the
type
bear
republic
nailed
it
note
imbibed
at
the
cellar
reserve
party
from
batches
that
would
go
on
to
the
various
festivals
thus
ensuring
the
beer
was
in
its
prime
oi
have
somewhat
mixed
feelings
on
this
beer
on
the
one
hand
i
feel
like
this
is
the
type
of
sour
lemon
bomb
that
is
overdone
and
scouring
in
its
highly
citric
lemony
acidic
glory
on
the
other
hand
this
beer
needs
no
elderberry
syrup
because
it
packs
plenty
of
flavor
on
its
own
a
no
holds
barred
berliner
i
guess
im
ok
with
that
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
a
beer
like
this
from
bear
republic
but
they
nailed
the
style
with
this
brew
verdict
a
delicious
berliner
weissbier
and
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
to
be
made
in
america
this
has
long
been
the
benchmark
of
the
style
and
its
deserved
one
of
the
more
refreshing
but
more
importantly
delicate
examples
available
overall
solid
beer
very
good
a
must
try
if
you
like
the
style
or
maybe
even
if
you
dont
overall
an
excellent
sour
offering
from
bear
republic
i
had
cuvee
de
bubba
once
and
it
was
a
bit
disappointing
this
one
however
was
quite
good
reminds
me
of
love
from
new
belgium
and
strikes
me
as
more
of
a
wild
ale
instead
of
a
berliner
total
4650
the
pour
is
nothing
to
look
atsuper
yellow
almost
looks
like
lemonade
smell
is
super
tart
and
lots
of
sourness
awesome
lemony
grainy
and
a
bit
of
ever
so
salty
flavor
tart
finish
with
a
huge
sourness
unlike
any
berliner
weiss
ive
had
this
is
way
more
tart
and
sour
than
most
but
simply
awesome
probably
the
best
bw
ive
ever
had
i
hope
to
have
this
again
one
day
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
collapses
quickly
juxtaposed
with
the
cantillon
iris
grand
cru
the
wheat
in
this
beer
is
really
pronounced
plenty
sour
sharp
lactic
with
some
acetic
notes
as
well
this
is
cidery
fruity
white
grapes
a
little
husky
and
yummy
the
palate
opens
very
sour
with
a
little
bit
of
solvent
and
nail
polish
remover
harshly
so
unripe
grapes
some
wheat
and
raw
lemons
round
out
the
palate
drying
sour
and
with
some
oak
on
the
finish
this
is
a
little
disappointing
the
antithesis
of
what
a
berlinerweisse
should
be
o
a
great
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
recommended
but
be
warned
it
is
sour
tartare
is
a
very
unique
take
on
an
already
interesting
style
of
beer
given
its
low
abv
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
on
a
hot
day
i
really
hope
bear
republic
decides
to
bottle
this
sometime
soon
light
crisp
refreshing
like
watching
lily
aldridge
using
a
loofa
raul
can
get
used
to
this
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
sour
ales
or
this
style
at
all
but
this
was
one
of
the
better
beers
not
just
of
this
style
but
of
all
styles
that
i
have
had
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
onefinger
head
and
minimal
lace
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
is
mostly
sour
and
tart
with
touches
of
sharp
spicy
citric
smooth
lightbodied
easy
to
drink
tastes
like
the
smell
with
an
extremely
sour
puckering
citrusy
vibe
with
some
funk
and
tartness
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
the
exact
tastes
finishes
real
crisp
and
dry
and
dont
know
if
i
could
session
this
as
the
sourness
could
wear
but
definitely
a
must
try
to
have
at
least
one
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
come
across
this
get
it
and
savor
it
the
aroma
was
properly
tart
with
a
nice
wheat
base
same
on
the
tongue
the
expected
mix
grain
and
sourness
with
any
particular
aspects
that
made
it
stand
out
the
body
was
on
the
light
side
but
still
had
a
subtle
substance
and
a
dry
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
on
a
summers
day
except
for
the
unrealistic
price
overall
a
very
good
and
enjoyable
brew
and
one
thats
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
stomach
the
price
o
excellent
interpretation
of
a
base
berliner
this
one
has
some
serious
tartness
this
is
probably
the
most
enjoyable
nonfruited
berliner
ive
ever
had
and
this
is
coming
from
someone
with
access
to
cigar
city
pegs
and
wakefields
stuff
excellent
and
highly
recommended
i
must
get
more
delivered
on
tap
at
pi
bar
san
francisco
ca
the
beer
appears
a
light
yellow
to
pear
color
with
little
to
no
head
whatsoever
no
hoppy
aroma
but
upon
further
sniffing
one
can
get
a
slight
tinge
of
the
sourness
upon
sipping
an
instantly
and
somewhat
overwhelmingly
sour
flavor
hits
the
palate
but
in
an
appreciable
and
exciting
way
low
alcohol
flavor
and
invites
you
to
drink
bigger
sips
wonderful
delicate
mouth
feel
provides
contrast
to
the
strong
sour
flavor
good
to
see
bear
republic
really
trying
to
make
something
special
and
i
wholeheartedly
approve
o
4
5
couple
of
thoughts
and
observations
im
not
a
huge
sour
fan
but
ive
enjoyed
the
german
versions
of
this
style
because
the
sour
component
generally
doesnt
smack
you
over
the
head
this
clearly
does
i
guess
this
beer
is
remarkable
for
the
level
of
flavor
you
get
in
a
4
beer
but
i
just
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
to
this
beer
than
sour
sour
sour
the
couple
next
to
me
at
bs
were
drinking
a
flight
of
left
over
sour
beers
from
puckerfest
and
i
was
surprised
they
hadnt
gotten
a
sample
glass
of
the
tartare
the
guy
told
me
that
he
was
a
huge
sour
fan
while
his
wife
gf
said
she
was
a
fan
but
not
to
the
extent
her
husband
was
so
i
happily
gave
them
my
glass
the
woman
indicated
that
the
beer
was
too
sour
for
her
while
the
gentleman
indicated
that
he
enjoyed
it
but
that
it
was
on
the
boundary
of
just
how
much
sour
he
could
tolerate
dont
believe
ill
be
ordering
this
one
again
a
very
good
berliner
weissbier
that
i
would
definitely
try
again
low
a
color
of
pale
straw
and
cloudyalmost
looks
like
fresh
farm
stand
lemonade
smells
lactic
with
light
hints
of
peach
and
citrus
lots
of
lacto
up
front
at
first
taste
with
notes
of
apricot
and
lemon
peel
little
to
no
wheatiness
good
mouthfeel
but
no
lacing
on
the
glass
whatsoever
finishes
very

is
overwhelmingly
tart
grassy
lemon
rind
sugar
im
somewhat
of
a
novice
in
the
style
but
this
was
pretty
staggering
easily
one
of
the
tartest
beers
ive
ever
consumed
sugars
lemon
wheat
lactic
pretty
intense
stuff
and
from
the
looks
of
it
a
whale
o
an
amazing
berliner
probably
the
best
i
have
had
great
sourtartness
for
style
with
plenty
of
fruit
flavor
not
sure
why
this
is
a
berliner
weiss
scored
as
that
it
would
be
much
lower
since
its
too
tart
and
oaky
with
not
nearly
enough
grainy
wheat
that
is
standard
for
the
style
as
an
american
wild
it
is
sublime
and
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
had
so
ive
scored
it
as
such
if
you
want
a
great
american
wild
try
this
beer
if
you
want
a
traditional
berliner
look
elsewhere
though
o
berliner
traditionalists
would
probably
cringe
upon
trying
this
brew
but
i
quite
enjoyed
it
for
the
enamel
and
esophagus
eating
qualities
that
i
experienced
huge
thanks
to
yourefragile
for
sharing
this
growler
served
in
a
cervoise
the
nose
is
fairly
tart
with
a
bit
of
wheat
in
the
background
but
mostly
sourness
and
light
stone
fruits
flavor
is
similar
its
quite
tart
and
unfortunately
doesnt
have
much
dry
wheat
character
like
a
great
berliner
instead
its
more
of
an
american
wild
though
a
good
one
at
that
o
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
but
takes
a
long
time
to
sip
given
the
heavy
amount
of
sourness
this
poured
out
as
a
muddy
looking
yellow
color
there
was
no
head
retention
on
this
or
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
obviously
sour
its
got
a
potent
amount
of
tart
aromas
coming
off
of
this
one
the
taste
is
also
very
tartsour
it
reminded
me
of
limes
or
lemons
almost
it
over
powers
the
malt
base
entirely
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
a
little
watery
its
refreshing
and
dry
all
at
the
same
time
overall
its
not
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
but
it
was
nice
to
try
tartare
pours
a
burnt
gold
yellow
and
is
totally
opaque
thanks
to
the
wheat
the
glass
arrives
without
a
bit
of
head
on
it
the
nose
has
a
sharp
citric
acidity
to
it
with
just
a
little
bit
of
grainy
wheat
appreciable
as
well
the
flavor
follows
through
on
that
blueprint
the
beer
is
highlighted
by
a
bright
lemon
tartness
which
is
just
kept
in
balance
by
the
flavor
of
the
wheat
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
body
contribution
from
the
wheat
and
its
the
only
thing
that
keeps
the
beer
from
coming
across
as
watery
meaning
the
beer
is
perfectly
light
bodied
the
effervescent
carbonation
lends
credence
to
the
styles
nickname
of
the
champagne
of
the
north
berliner
weiss
is
a
hit
and
miss
style
for
me
but
tartare
is
probably
the
best
of
the
bunch
that
ive
had
very
pale
straw
color
in
the
glass
nearly
a
pastel
shade
it
was
somewhat
hazy
and
glowed
when
held
to
the
light
thin
layer
of
white
foam
on
the
surface
that
stuck
around
for
the
first
couple
sips
aroma
had
a
whiff
of
sulfur
at
first
but
this
blew
off
fairly
quickly
revealing
sour
lemon
sharp
lacto
and
faint
supporting
notes
of
grainy
wheat
in
the
background
extremely
tart
more
of
an
explosive
sourness
that
builds
quickly
and
vanishes
just
as
fast
very
crisp
and
clean
puckering
lemon
and
dry
like
champagne
in
the
finish
a
well
crafted
berliner
weisse
much
more
sour
than
most
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
low
abv
was
welcome
and
it
certainly
stood
out
as
a
memorable
beer
early
on
preceeding
a
night
full
of
booze
monsters
beer
is
very
sour
almost
one
note
sour
very
lactic
mildly
succinic
an
interesting
and
grainy
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
nice
berliner
for
sure
i
do
enjoy
it
and
glad
i
got
to
try
it
while
perhaps
not
the
most
authentic
this
is
probably
the
best
and
most
memorable
example
of
the
style
ive
tried
to
date
seek
this
one
out
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
dull
and
slightly
hazy
yellowpineapplejuice
color
with
no
head
other
than
a
thin
ringlet
of
bubbles
that
fizzled
out
in
a
couple
minutes
tart
and
lactic
in
the
nose
funky
and
slightly
floral
this
is
reflected
in
the
taste
quite
tart
and
puckering
at
first
lemon
and
grapefruit
citric
and
lactic
acid
not
so
much
acetic
though
there
was
a
slight
vinegary
presence
in
there
secondary
flavors
of
biscuity
malts
white
grapes
and
grassy
funk
but
the
sournesstartness
was
clearly
in
charge
here
medium
body
quite
good
for
the
style
definitely
a
tasty
brew
worth
revisiting
highly
acetic
just
how
i
like
my
sours
tartare
may
be
too
intense
for
some
but
i
would
happily
drink
this
all
day
long
given
the
chance
fantastic
execution
of
the
style
please
bottle
this
o
i
know
this
is
a
berliner
weiss
and
ive
only
ever
had
one
other
by
comparison
this
beer
probably
doesnt
fit
the
standard
mold
but
who
cares
rating
to
style
would
take
away
from
how
great
this
beer
is
so
i
am
rating
based
on
my
experience
which
was
outstanding
maybe
my
favorite
beer
of
the
day
o
this
is
hands
down
the
best
berliner
ive
ever
had
the
previous
record
holder
was
funky
buddhas
passionfruit
and
this
one
beats
it
handily
i
didnt
know
this
one
was
barrel
aged
but
after
reading
the
description
i
can
totally
see
how
the
chardonnay
barrel
helped
this
one
out
would
love
to
have
again
relative
to
other
beers
in
the
style
i
couldnt
give
this
beer
anything
but
a
5
pours
like
a
beautiful
cloudy
pinot
grigio
with
a
moderate
head
smells
of
lemon
juice
dominate
the
nose
taste
an
absolute
sour
bomb
this
sourness
of
this
beer
rivals
if
not
exceeds
the
most
sour
of
gueuzes
and
will
satisfy
those
who
seek
that
kind
of
experience
however
to
me
its
too
sour
for
the
style
like
drinking
apple
cider
vinegar
cut
with
perrier
still
it
had
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
like
a
stellar
berliner
weiss
should
in
small
doses
this
is
an
excellent
experience
as
for
a
full
glass
maybe
a
little
too
much
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
it
very
tangy
and
sour
for
a
berliner
which
cuts
back
quite
a
bit
on
its
overall
drinkability
fans
of
sours
will
absolutely
love
this
brew
i
surprisingly
did
not
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
this
is
really
a
take
on
the
style
that
exceeds
the
upper
limits
of
how
tart
a
berliner
should
be
it
is
worth
trying
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
glass
of
this
at
a
time
if
the
style
was
changed
to
american
wild
id
increase
my
rating
across
the
board
but
for
a
berliner
this
one
is
brutal
this
is
a
very
rare
occurance
where
adding
woodruff
would
have
appealed
to
me
o
tartare
is
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
berliner
weiss
style
and
easily
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
due
to
the
fairly
sharp
acidity
but
a
must
try
for
any
fan
of
the
style
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
with
some
measured
creativity
on
display
from
the
exposure
to
wood
overall
quite
nice
good
tartness
fruit
and
citrus
acidity
lighter
on
the
funk
and
bready
mts
though
nice
oak
too
o
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
super
sour
and
creamy
this
really
shines
in
many
levels
o
very
enjoyable
but
only
for
someone
that
truly
appreciates
the
style
or
sour
beers
this
is
probably
the
most
sour
beer
that
i
have
had
in
the
style
not
super
easy
to
drink
but
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
poured
from
draft
into
a
9
oz
snifter
pours
a
mountain
dewesque
shade
with
minimal
head
and
zero
lacing
nose
is
fairly
subdued
but
a
powerwhiff
reveals
the
heart
of
this
beast
lactic
sour
madness
the
taste
is
akin
to
liquid
sour
like
if
sour
were
an
extract
the
mouth
is
thin
with
a
further
tart
finish
solid
beer
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
outstanding
berliner
im
struggling
to
think
of
one
i
liked
much
better
than
this
i
had
never
heard
of
it
and
assumed
it
was
a
new
br
hoppy
beer
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
look
it
up
and
see
it
was
a
berliner
and
even
more
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
it
actually
live
up
to
the
reviews
and
score
tons
of
sour
fruit
and
lemon
with
some
funk
in
the
taste
too
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
i
dont
know
if
this
is
deserving
of
being
the
1
ranked
berliner
that
being
said
this
is
different
than
any
other
beer
ive
had
from
the
style
super
tart
and
juicy
and
very
refreshing
surely
worth
trying
great
stuff
tartare
looks
real
pretty
in
the
glass
right
off
the
tap
there
is
no
bubbles
to
be
seen
at
all
its
all
liquid
a
bright
gold
color
with
some
yellow
surroundings
some
swirls
bring
the
faintest
amount
of
trying
to
survive
bubbles
that
die
no
stick
smell
on
this
sucka
is
wonderful
i
get
some
nice
wheat
base
with
some
lactic
quality
some
pear
apple
white
wine
characteristics
some
tart
lemon
spritz
in
here
as
well
integrated
and
bold
nose
wonderful
to
get
into
tartare
is
one
of
the
more
tart
forward
berliners
out
there
this
is
eye
opening
lemon
apple
lacto
wheat
pale
malt
white
wine
sour
patch
kids
flavors
are
well
integrated
body
is
light
lactic
sourness
very
lightly
carbed
hardly
at
all
while
the
flavor
was
intene
and
mind
blowing
to
say
the
least
it
took
me
some
time
to
clear
my
glass
the
pucker
is
a
bit
overbearing
but
oh
so
awesome
this
is
easily
the
best
most
in
your
face
tart
berliner
i
have
experienced
a
winner
in
all
aspects
this
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
golden
color
with
tight
bubbles
atop
it
big
tart
aroma
grapefruit
juice
freshly
squeezed
and
justjuiced
lemon
the
kind
that
will
sting
your
eyes
when
you
first
take
a
bite
the
flavor
has
a
light
and
delicate
tartnessmore
tart
than
bitter
but
it
seems
like
theres
some
bitterness
midpointand
a
dry
crisp
finish
good
one
id
like
to
see
this
in
bottles
t
im
quickly
falling
in
love
with
this
style
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
ive
had
lemon
warhead
sour
upfront
with
a
ton
of
lactic
sourness
tastes
like
biting
into
a
lemon
some
light
wheat
on
the
finish
amazing
stuff
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
frothy
white
foam
atop
and
much
higher
clarity
than
i
had
anticipated
nose
is
lacto
grain
hints
of
soil
and
hay
a
bit
of
lemon
and
green
grape
skins
flavor
packs
a
punch
nice
and
sour
with
lemon
and
citrisy
acidity
nice
and
refreshing
with
crispy
carbonation
and
a
thin
body
off
dry
finish
that
quickly
makes
me
salivate
this
one
is
probably
the
best
american
version
ive
had
to
date
really
fine
job
so
excited
to
see
this
on
tap
at
this
years
bluesapalooza
festival
and
not
too
many
people
knew
they
were
tapping
it
so
i
got
to
have
like
6
tasters
of
it
i
loved
it
appearance
was
a
strawlike
lemonade
yellow
color
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
scent
is
verywheat
forward
with
a
ton
of
funky
sour
aromas
going
on
picking
up
a
lot
of
lacto
and
acidic
aromas
a
lot
of
lemon
as
well
taste
is
wow
way
more
sour
than
i
was
expecting
definitely
the
most
sour
berliner
ive
ever
had
sour
lemon
flavors
with
white
wine
vinegar
and
sour
white
grapes
a
lot
of
wheat
and
funky
lacto
acidic
flavors
puckering
mouthfeel
was
very
light
puckering
and
refreshing
drinkability
was
very
high
overall
my
favorite
beer
of
the
night
so
much
sour
with
such
high
drinkability
my
gums
did
feel
like
they
were
ruined
after
my
6
taster
glasses
though
overall
excellent
unfruited
berliner
im
spoiled
in
florida
but
this
is
quite
good
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
your
a
sour
head
this
thing
packs
a
ton
of
pucker
actually
to
much
for
me
to
really
have
more
than
another
o
a
highlight
of
the
event
sitting
under
a
tree
listening
to
the
fake
stream
flow
past
in
the
garden
very
nice
indeed
cloudy
but
bright
golden
yellow
bubbly
and
prickly
white
head
decent
retention
and
some
sticky
lacing
scent
hits
me
across
the
face
with
tart
lactic
sourness
beneath
lies
notes
of
earth
grain
and
watery
fruit
taste
brings
huge
tartness
as
nose
promised
it
has
some
good
earthy
grainy
and
fruit
charachter
but
its
really
all
about
the
tartness
and
funk
big
bold
and
bright
aggressive
yet
refreshing
dry
yet
quenching
in
my
quest
to
drink
as
many
berliner
weiss
as
i
can
this
summer
ive
had
one
that
range
from
lightly
tart
and
graininy
to
this
big
bold
tart
and
sour
one
fantastic
please
for
the
love
of
god
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
super
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
lemon
and
lactic
acid
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
fantastic
mouth
watering
flavor
and
an
acidic
finish
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
awesome
and
refreshing
beer
and
by
far
the
best
beer
in
the
style
that
i
have
tried
so
far
in
my
beer
tasting
journey
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
best
berliner
weisse
that
i
have
been
able
to
try
i
will
definitely
order
this
again
if
i
see
it
this
is
on
the
level
tart
and
mildly
lactic
and
thankfully
not
too
much
so
has
that
sticky
kind
of
thick
feel
to
it
that
fits
to
what
ive
experienced
of
the
style
in
the
past
if
youve
never
had
this
type
of
beer
before
you
may
not
be
prepared
for
it
though
if
youve
had
legitimate
lambics
and
gueuzes
youll
probably
be
okay
regardless
this
is
an
intense
beer
that
does
not
cut
corners
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
light
body
with
some
decent
zesty
carbonation
makes
this
very
refreshing
what
a
surprisingly
excellent
sour
beer
from
bear
republic
pours
a
bright
hazy
straw
golden
with
a
a
few
fingers
of
white
creamy
head
fades
a
to
collar
with
spots
of
lacing
grainy
bready
nose
blends
with
lacto
sourness
and
mild
citrus
light
earth
and
floral
notes
in
the
finish
light
effervescent
refreshing
body
with
prickly
carbonation
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
sour
and
tart
lemon
acidity
with
a
strong
sourdough
bread
presence
mid
palate
lemon
sourness
builds
through
the
finish
with
light
floral
notes
occasionally
emerging
oak
dries
out
the
surprisingly
clean
finish
damn
bear
republic
this
was
a
surprise
i
cant
believe
i
have
never
had
this
style
before
and
i
love
sours
such
a
great
beer
and
style
i
hope
more
american
breweries
start
pumping
out
berliner
weissebiers
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
amount
of
sour
acidity
that
lingers
over
the
sweet
citrus
and
bready
yeast
into
a
lingering
acetic
vinegary
finish
kind
of
like
a
sour
kvass
with
lots
of
bread
citrus
acidity
and
funk
well
this
was
certainly
interesting
its
hard
to
take
this
one
as
a
straight
up
berliner
weiss
experience
as
the
barrel
and
funkiness
definitely
took
this
to
an
another
place
still
im
glad
to
say
that
ive
tried
it
its
a
woodaged
berliner
weiss
for
crying
out
loud
the
taste
is
like
tart
lemon
juice
with
the
rind
ground
up
and
thrown
in
for
extra
astringency
wout
any
sweet
flavors
to
balance
kind
of
funky
with
subtle
carbonation
level
and
very
dry
bitter
taste
with
tannic
presence
and
not
really
any
wheat
i
can
gather
simply
sour
and
acidic
with
citrus
bite
and
mildly
acetic
taste
with
earthy
jolt
of
sour
and
light
nutty
finish
of
wood
overall
not
the
most
drinkable
of
the
style
and
just
sour
taste
after
sour
flavor
with
the
bile
like
bite
which
i
found
to
be
just
a
bit
harsh
on
the
palate
i
could
not
see
having
more
than
one
which
is
not
what
i
like
from
a
berliner
the
pour
is
a
pale
straw
hue
with
a
short
lived
white
head
an
excellent
tartness
to
the
aroma
very
sharp
lactic
acidity
to
go
along
with
plenty
of
wheat
a
little
bit
of
lemon
peel
and
maybe
some
popcorn
the
flavor
is
similarly
enjoyable
great
lemon
peel
and
lemon
juice
tartness
with
an
undertone
of
sweetness
from
the
wheat
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
well
done
beer
o
pretty
outstanding
overall
blown
away
by
this
one
nice
and
sour
unlike
some
berliner
weisses
ive
had
before
even
at
8
for
10oz
i
had
to
have
a
second
glass
wishing
i
had
bought
a
growler
wow
a
nice
sour
from
bear
republic
for
a
change
on
tap
at
toronado
hazy
straw
hued
body
with
a
thin
head
that
doesnt
provide
much
stickage
great
lacto
and
grain
aroma
a
bit
sourdoughlike
little
funkiness
too
bright
sharp
acidic
palate
pretty
citrusy
with
a
pleasant
lacto
profile
thats
extremely
refreshing
touch
of
pineapple
grain
not
much
oak
or
barrel
to
speak
of
brief
thirst
quenching
finish
drank
a
few
of
these
and
could
have
had
more
low
abv
with
a
ton
of
flavor
drank
this
side
by
side
with
cable
car
2010
and
found
this
better
finishes
bright
and
dry
with
lingering
tart
overall
a
very
good
berliner
weiss
dont
pass
this
up
if
you
enjoy
the
style
o
very
tart
but
great
flavor
super
lemon
flavor
and
clean
thanks
again
for
bringing
the
growler
mike
ive
gotta
hand
it
to
bear
republic
they
usually
win
me
over
with
their
hoppy
beers
e
g
racer
x
mach
10
but
this
beer
takes
the
cake
tartness
hits
the
tongue
and
refuses
to
let
go
but
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
with
sour
acidity
lemon
sourdough
and
vinous
funk
are
equally
in
effect
mouthfeel
is
ultimately
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
the
4
is
perhaps
the
crowned
jewel
of
this
beer
so
flavorful
yet
entirely
sessionable
all
the
while
highly
recommended
o
a
really
good
and
impressive
berliner
weisse
maybe
not
completely
to
style
but
this
was
one
good
beer
bear
republic
is
a
very
good
brewery
though
it
is
not
known
for
sour
ales
so
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
everybody
that
this
came
out
of
headlesburg
this
is
a
beer
that
should
turn
some
heads
awesome
beer
i
had
this
on
draft
today
at
the
pub
and
it
blew
me
away
unfortunately
so
did
a
couple
of
their
other
beers
and
i
opted
for
a
different
growler
i
regretted
not
getting
this
one
the
minute
i
left
i
can
only
hope
i
will
be
able
to
try
it
again
o
super
drinkable
and
nice
and
complex
lots
going
on
with
this
beer
and
i
went
back
for
a
couple
servings
well
made
berliner
that
i
would
drink
often
straw
color
with
a
quickly
fading
white
foam
smells
of
peaches
and
wheat
the
taste
is
just
okay
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
peach
flavor
but
you
do
taste
subtle
fruitiness
upfront
very
well
carbonated
but
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
i
liked
the
second
beer
more
than
the
first
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
o
the
peche
in
the
name
had
me
expecting
a
lambic
but
this
is
berliner
all
the
way
should
have
named
it
pfirsich
a
great
beer
for
a
summer
afternoon
sitting
in
a
garden
the
fact
i
can
see
it
as
an
excuse
for
the
next
few
weeks
of
very
sour
and
delicious
try
it
if
you
can
another
outstanding
beer
from
delaware
just
enough
peach
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
not
overwhelmingly
peachy
just
enough
fruity
without
being
wimpy
goes
great
with
summer
way
too
sour
and
hardly
any
peach
very
disappointing
pale
straw
color
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
massive
white
head
a
little
barnyard
funk
cut
grass
and
a
hint
of
peach
on
the
nose
nice
mouthpuckering
tartness
slight
creaminess
and
again
just
a
touch
of
peach
in
the
flavor
not
my
favorite
berliner
weisse
but
not
bad
this
ones
pretty
easy
to
find
and
still
scratches
that
itch
this
was
a
good
beer
a
little
weak
for
dfh
overall
3
55
pretty
good
a
little
bland
but
would
be
a
good
choice
in
a
bar
a
little
tart
for
my
taste
but
overall
pretty
solid
due
to
the
fizziness
and
foaminess
of
the
pour
i
opted
to
drink
this
from
the
bottle
instead
the
peach
flavor
and
foaminess
come
together
as
a
a
good
substitute
for
sparkling
wine
otherwise
definitely
a
summer
timebbq
beer
light
and
fizzy
could
use
more
flavor
its
ok
great
summer
beer
by
dfh
the
peach
flavor
is
tremendous
i
understand
that
this
is
a
session
beer
but
i
wish
the
abv
was
a
tad
higher
great
sour
beer
tasty
and
only
slightly
acidic
clean
crisp
and
delicious
v
not
really
worth
purchasing
a
weisse
beer
that
is
absolutely
reminiscent
of
a
white
wine
effervescent
fizzy
carbonation
with
a
light
sourness
was
expecting
a
puckering
of
the
lips
but
found
this
to
be
softened
out
by
the
addition
of
the
peach
would
absolutely
go
well
with
most
food
items
especially
meats
or
seafood
very
enjoyable
i
love
this
brew
perfect
for
a
hot
day
this
is
one
of
the
few
berliner
style
brews
available
to
me
in
a
4
pack
all
other
options
are
expensive
bombers
will
drink
again
so
peachy
good
light
and
crisp
smells
good
and
tastes
better
reminiscint
of
a
fuzzy
navel
wine
cooler
my
teenage
years
i
know
fuzzy
navel
thin
bodies
nice
clean
lagerlike
finish
at
4
5
very
drinkable
refreshing
prickly
appetizing
definitely
worth
a
try
very
tardy
and
almost
explodes
when
it
hits
your
mouth
so
it
does
have
a
nice
fizz
to
it
also
very
light
reminds
me
of
a
peach
cider
with
a
dry
finish
flavor
wise
its
sweet
and
very
tardy
and
i
dont
pick
up
too
much
of
the
aroma
not
crazy
about
it
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
does
it
need
to
be
anything
else
no
absolutely
not
insanely
addictive
i
remember
when
dfh
first
came
out
with
this
beer
i
was
worried
about
how
much
i
would
see
it
on
the
shelves
luckily
it
has
become
a
staple
i
see
it
all
the
time
now
and
deservedly
so
as
i
am
writing
this
review
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
over
a
month
but
as
soon
as
i
feel
consecutive
90degree
days
again
ill
be
going
to
it
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
fruit
flavored
beers

overall

o
a
decent
berliner
weiss
i
dont
pick
up
much
peach
in
the
flavor
but
still
very
refreshing
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
from
dogfish
head
it
definitely
wasnt
the
classic
that
i
was
hoping
for
but
it
had
enough
going
for
it
to
keep
things
interesting
and
enjoyable
particularly
because
ive
frequently
found
berliner
weisse
beers
a
little
too
strong
and
overpowering
at
times
the
beer
had
a
pleasant
citrus
and
peach
taste
to
it
that
went
down
relatively
easily
particularly
after
it
settled
down
and
opened
up
some
its
one
well
worth
trying
but
id
probably
opt
for
something
else
over
this
one
if
i
ever
came
across
it
in
future
festina
pêche
brewed
by
dogfish
head
brewery
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
4
5
this
brew
pours
out
a
light
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
this
is
an
unfiltered
brew
you
can
not
see
though
it
the
smell
is
sweet
with
fruits
and
spices
the
taste
is
sour
with
sweetness
this
brew
is
different
from
any
brew
i
have
ever
had
this
brew
is
bitter
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
bitter
sweet
i
like
how
this
brew
is
different
from
the
rest
on
the
market
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
75
out
5
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
try
festina
pêche
dogfish
head
brewery
overall
a
4
for
festina
pêche
dogfish
head
brewery
i
really
enjoyed
the
diversion
of
sweet
wheat
brew
for
this
sour
one
i
may
pick
this
brew
up
again
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
thick
fluffy
white
head
the
head
seemed
to
last
quite
a
long
time
and
left
some
very
nice
lacing
to
the
end
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
peach
up
front
with
some
tartness
and
wheat
notes
and
just
a
touch
of
yeasty
funk
the
taste
was
nice
peachy
tartness
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
light
but
in
a
very
nice
way
as
it
combined
with
the
carbonation
to
really
set
the
flavors
off
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
very
refreshing
after
a
workout
and
very
sessionable
nice
job
dfh
light
saisonlike
taste
with
subtle
hints
of
fruit
and
layered
flavors
beer
has
a
light
sour
finish
low
alcohol
content
adds
to
the
beers
high
drinkability
delicious
lighter
on
the
tartness
but
the
peaches
come
through
crisp
dry
finish
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
great
springsummyer
brew
the
scent
reminded
me
of
a
dry
smell
you
get
with
fruit
fermentation
and
had
a
taste
similar
to
a
wine
the
bubbles
tingle
joyfully
on
my
tongue
decided
to
try
this
after
getting
tired
of
ever
hoppier
ipa
which
i
love
but
hey
gott
go
the
other
way
sometimes
i
was
impressed
by
the
relative
lack
of
sweetness
it
is
flavorful
and
redolent
of
peaches
but
refreshing
and
tart
has
a
very
clean
finish
too
and
is
an
attractive
orangeyellow
head
is
pretty
minimal
and
carbonation
pretty
high
a
very
pleasant
surprise
o
good
sour
i
dont
pick
up
on
the
peach
crisp
would
definitely
buy
again
interesting
peach
weissbeer
color
is
very
pale
and
slightly
cloudy
with
constant
bubbles
rising
aroma
is
light
and
peachy
taste
is
pretty
interesting
lots
of
carbonation
tart
peach
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
also
the
wheat
flavor
is
there
overall
very
refreshing
and
tangy
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
sour
very
pleasant
and
refereshing
the
taste
is
great
the
aroma
is
on
the
light
side
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
very
little
head
it
has
an
interesting
and
sour
aroma
of
peaches
and
a
hint
of
apple
overall
a
weak
fruity
aroma
the
aroma
resembled
more
of
a
hard
cider
rather
than
an
ale
there
were
a
few
flavors
that
managed
to
surface
through
the
overpowering
sourness
there
was
not
as
much
peach
flavor
as
expected
but
there
was
a
very
acidic
apple
flavor
there
were
flavors
resembling
that
of
a
sparkling
white
wine
overall
i
was
not
too
pleased
with
this
beer
but
it
will
please
palates
fond
of
sour
flavors
and
hard
ciders
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
peach
taste
was
quite
flavorful
nice
example
of
the
berliner
weissbier
style
another
stellar
seasonal
by
dfh
i
actually
had
to
throw
this
beer
away
first
time
that
has
ever
happened
no
peach
aroma
at
all
and
so
sour
it
was
undrinkable
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
i
am
super
disappointed
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
found
myself
swinging
at
a
curve
ball
here
having
tried
a
number
of
summertime
peach
brews
with
a
favorable
impression
i
had
nothing
but
great
expectations
fron
dfh
but
low
behold
i
was
pretty
disappointed
listed
as
weisseer
i
figured
there
would
be
a
hint
of
dry
or
citrus
but
all
i
got
was
a
medium
body
rather
bland
beer
with
a
syrupy
overlay
on
the
tongue
more
contrived
than
complex
neither
refreshing
nor
bright
ill
stick
to
the
north
carolina
guys
for
this
style
next
time
peachy
syrup
and
tart
pale
golden
hued
with
a
fingernail
of
eggshell
white
foam
hazy
complexion
is
present
perfume
sweetness
of
peaches
is
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
nose
the
flavor
is
extremely
sweet
almost
to
the
point
of
being
cloying
this
is
like
a
peach
candy
i
bet
this
would
be
more
appealing
with
a
scoop
or
two
of
vanilla
ice
cream
the
mouth
is
slightly
sticky
and
mildly
carbonated
a
good
change
of
pace
refreshing
sourness
i
liked
it
enough
but
at
the
same
time
glad
i
just
got
a
single
bottle
o
this
was
a
different
type
of
beer
than
i
am
use
to
but
it
wasnt
terrible
lots
of
flavors
a
refreshing
brew
and
well
balanced
as
well
very
nice
the
appearance
was
a
light
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
full
of
peach
and
sour
notes
the
taste
was
full
of
sour
flavors
that
balanced
well
with
the
sweetness
from
the
peach
as
well
as
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
malt
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
finishes
the
beer
off
very
well
for
those
who
love
a
bit
of
sweet
and
sour
this
is
a
very
bubbly
and
fruity
beer
fairly
low
in
abv
in
comparison
to
many
dogfish
head
brews
this
is
more
like
a
simplistic
champaign
offering
lovely
peach
notes
and
carbonation
great
in
a
fat
tulip
glass
or
perhaps
even
a
flute
its
extremely
tasty
and
bold
in
color
probably
the
ne
plus
ultra
of
fruit
beers
a
category
i
usually
dislike
on
account
of
the
oft
sickly
sweetness
sam
caligione
gets
it
right
letting
the
yeast
eat
up
all
the
residual
sugars
and
leaving
behind
just
the
flavor
not
the
sweet
tart
like
a
lambic
but
without
the
brett
funk
i
can
see
why
some
beer
drinkers
might
balk
its
not
really
beery
and
reads
more
like
a
dry
cava
on
the
palate
crazy
good
with
seafood
especially
shellfish
great
with
a
plate
of
raw
oysters
and
a
lobster
roll
used
a
bottle
to
steam
some
mussels
and
clams
awesome
a
knockout
if
not
the
most
beery
of
beers
mouthfeel
a
light
refreshing
beer
not
quite
the
peach
i
was
looking
for
but
a
good
balance
between
fruit
and
sour
poured
into
a
tulip
thin
white
head
dissipates
almost
immediately
very
thin
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
straw
yellow
and
slightly
cloudy
aroma
is
sour
apples
with
wild
yeast
dominant
the
tart
yeast
profile
is
predominant
in
the
flavor
with
very
little
fruit
noticeable
until
the
sip
is
gone
really
mellow
peach
aftertaste
combined
with
the
residual
sweetnees
gives
this
more
of
a
tangerine
and
clementine
flavor
than
peach
very
drinkable
but
id
like
to
have
a
version
of
this
where
the
fruit
shines
more
and
isnt
so
muted
by
the
yeast
im
a
huge
fan
of
wild
yeast
in
beers
but
i
expected
more
fruit
intensity
even
for
a
berliner
weisse
for
a
fruit
beer
its
very
good
well
balanced
and
refreshing
o
a
good
foreplay
to
the
concert
could
session
this
one
after
a
bout
with
the
yard
o
an
excellent
berliner
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
body
the
standard
berliners
do
with
the
sweet
sugary
peach
notes
dominating
its
also
not
quite
as
tart
as
the
more
modern
examples
of
the
style
what
it
is
though
is
wellmade
closer
to
the
classic
style
than
most
examples
these
days
while
i
definitely
would
have
enjoyed
a
bit
more
graininess
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
delicious
there
arent
enough
berliners
today
in
my
opinion
festina
peche
demonstrates
why
brewers
should
visit
this
style
more
often
outstanding
brew
here
o
not
bitter
and
not
sweet
slightly
sour
another
great
beer
from
the
best
brewery
in
the
us
i
would
drink
many
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
3
75
definitely
an
interesting
and
fun
beer
for
summer
not
something
i
would
feel
the
need
to
hunt
down
but
its
refreshing
and
tasty
some
more
tartness
and
carbonation
would
take
this
beer
from
good
to
great
considering
not
many
folks
make
this
style
the
peaches
are
subtle
and
are
not
boozy
or
cloying
think
the
pulp
at
the
pit
pf
a
peach
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
the
heat
of
the
south
at
4
7
you
can
have
a
few
and
not
look
like
the
town
drunk
this
is
a
widely
available
berliner
the
only
berliner
i
like
better
is
new
glarus
out
of
wisco
recommended
vintage
fresh
do
not
age
o
im
a
huge
fan
of
peach
beers
done
well
and
while
festina
peche
isnt
a
knockyoursocksoff
peach
beer
the
light
peach
nuance
behind
the
classic
tart
acidity
of
a
berliner
is
an
amazing
combination
this
beer
is
superbly
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
overall
well
done
brew
by
dfh
here
the
peaches
certainly
dominate
but
they
really
fit
within
the
style
nice
malt
and
yeast
notes
pull
the
style
through
the
wheat
character
comes
through
a
bit
more
after
each
sip
as
dogfish
head
says
this
is
a
sessionsour
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
brew
that
is
very
refreshing
brew
to
quaff
back
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
couldnt
get
past
the
sour
i
ended
up
breaking
my
own
rule
never
dump
a
beer
that
is
the
first
beer
in
my
life
i
ever
purposely
dumped
down
the
drain
sorry
dogfish
ogreat
berlinner
that
is
tart
and
refreshing
highly
recommend
o
i
found
this
beer
hard
to
drink
because
it
was
very
carbonated
and
tart
almost
reminded
me
of
a
mix
between
a
soda
and
hard
cider
it
was
very
unique
to
say
the
least
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
but
for
its
originality
i
think
it
is
average
to
good
just
a
great
beer
and
a
top
notch
interpretation
of
the
style
made
right
here
in
murica
overall
much
better
than
the
ratings
indicated
although
i
do
have
a
slight
bias
towards
dfh
this
one
is
a
pleasant
surprise
pleasantly
briny
minerally
and
balanced
to
perfection
with
the
acidity
of
dried
lemon
and
lime
the
strong
lactic
acid
tanginess
of
the
ale
provides
the
palate
with
a
high
rate
of
refreshment
clean
and
crisp
throughout
with
brief
echoes
of
peach
and
waferthin
wheat
in
the
beers
postfinish
era
perfect
for
all
those
hot
and
hazy
days
of
summer
o
refreshing
berliner
weisse
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
very
smooth
beer
i
would
understand
why
it
may
not
please
everyones
palate
but
it
hit
me
right
for
a
mid
fourth
of
july
treat
overall
a
pretty
solid
twist
on
a
berliner
weiss
good
bready
wheat
presence
with
a
nice
sour
kick
of
peaches
my
beer
guru
left
this
one
for
me
as
he
knows
i
love
sours
a
little
light
looking
but
a
mixed
bag
has
some
haziness
at
least
initially
and
pretty
fluffy
head
that
did
not
stick
to
the
glass
not
much
to
the
nose
although
i
was
working
outside
so
maybe
allergy
limited
outstanding
flavor
got
that
nice
sour
touch
but
not
overwhelming
very
clean
and
smooth
absolutely
perfect
after
some
work
in
the
yard
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
am
surprised
is
not
getting
better
ratings
thanks
beer
guru
hadnt
even
heard
of
this
one
and
i
like
dogfish
will
be
looking
for
it
in
future
im
a
big
fan
of
dfh
ive
had
many
of
their
other
beers
and
am
never
disappointed
until
i
came
to
this
beer
it
tastes
more
like
cider
or
sparkling
wine
than
beer
someone
did
tell
me
to
mix
it
with
their
90min
ipa
so
i
guess
ill
give
it
another
shot
o
a
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
four
pack
of
this
one
despite
the
15
99
price
point
it
would
have
been
worth
it
overall
light
and
refreshing
its
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
its
more
like
champagne
but
a
good
warm
weather
beer
i
would
definitely
purchase
this
beer
again
pours
a
beautiful
light
gold
with
just
a
hint
of
haze
the
head
has
minor
retention
after
coming
out
a
creamy
white
minor
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
blend
between
the
traditional
wheat
beer
yeast
light
fruit
and
a
tart
quality
that
tart
quality
comes
through
loud
and
clear
in
the
taste
dominating
the
wheat
beer
aspects
if
you
like
tartsour
this
one
will
probably
be
right
up
your
alley
it
does
mellow
out
a
little
as
it
breathes
it
has
a
normal
weight
to
the
body
for
the
style
all
in
all
i
dont
prefer
sour
beers
but
this
is
a
wellmade
example
of
the
style
o
not
my
style
but
very
well
done
o
a
light
on
another
approach
to
fruit
beers
the
peach
offers
a
delicious
counterpoint
to
the
grain
and
yeast
but
sour
notes
are
probably
the
main
flavor
element
here
very
light
on
the
tongue
it
makes
for
a
real
contrast
to
its
more
syrupy
fruit
beer
counterparts
o
purchased
at
room
temp
i
only
had
this
in
the
fridge
about
an
hour
before
cracking
open
kinda
wishing
it
had
been
colder
its
a
pleasant
drink
for
sure
a
nice
variation
or
take
on
the
style
just
perhaps
a
little
too
safe
and
accessible
a
fantastic
beer
this
pours
a
fairly
pale
yellow
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
a
hint
of
grain
and
peaches
in
the
mix
the
taste
is
really
different
than
you
would
expect
from
the
look
and
aroma
its
sweet
with
a
decent
flavor
of
grain
and
peaches
the
texture
is
smooth
and
light
that
make
for
an
easy
summer
drinking
brew
not
and
big
and
bold
as
most
dogfish
head
beers
but
delicious
just
the
same
i
didnt
use
all
my
characters
so
i
had
to
add
more
to
my
review
i
really
wish
dogfish
head
would
start
bottling
the
raison
dêtre
again
my
go
to
favorite
after
pouring
it
in
a
glass
the
clear
faint
gold
color
reminded
me
of
a
dessert
wine
texture
was
on
par
color
was
on
par
and
very
little
carbonation
was
produced
when
i
tasted
it
it
was
like
a
carbonated
chardonnay
there
was
hardly
any
taste
of
wheat
or
hops
although
some
hints
lingered
i
dont
know
if
dhb
is
trying
to
achieve
this
effect
but
for
sure
festina
peche
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
it
is
either
amazing
or
a
flop
o
there
is
a
high
degree
of
variability
on
the
reviews
for
this
beer
for
those
who
are
not
acquainted
with
sour
beers
this
may
be
a
bit
of
a
shocker
for
those
well
acquainted
this
may
leave
some
to
be
desired
for
me
personally
i
think
that
dfh
nailed
this
interpretation
of
a
berliner
and
am
thrilled
to
drink
this
beer
every
time
and
i
am
generally
a
stoutporter
head
o
its
alright
i
picked
it
up
4
for
a
4
pack
i
may
try
it
again
if
i
ever
see
it
on
draft
overall
there
no
beer
here
mostly
just
canned
peaches
tasty
though
and
plenty
of
peach
but
why
make
it
a
beer
i
can
just
go
to
the
store
and
buy
canned
peaches
and
pour
some
vodka
in
it
and
call
it
a
day
overallcomments
wow
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
brew
that
was
very
well
done
as
well
as
being
very
unique
in
its
flavor
profile
i
think
this
would
be
great
ice
cold
on
a
warm
summer
day
i
suggest
trying
this
one
classified
as
a
berliner
weissbier

o
my
friend
gave
this
to
me
insisting
that
this
years
festina
was
the
best
thus
far
and
i
gotta
say
i
agree
while
this
still
isnt
my
idea
of
a
fantastic
berliner
weisse
they
really
got
the
peach
flavor
to
shine
this
time
around
still
lacks
carbonation
and
the
complexity
of
a
sour
but
its
perfect
to
introduce
someone
to
the
concept
of
sourness
in
beer
maybe
one
day
theyll
figure
out
how
to
make
it
as
good
as
one

dissapointment

this
simple
but
surprisingly
sharp
little
beer
doesnt
need
to
be
categorized
just
drank
i
dont
know
why
this
isnt
in
the
fruitflavoured
beer
category
but
whatever
either
way
its
biggest
problem
is
carbonation
its
way
overcarbonated
so
overcarbonated
that
it
gets
too
foamy
for
the
refreshing
fruity
characters
to
do
their
job
its
hard
to
call
foam
refreshing
otherwise
i
think
its
really
great
im
not
often
into
these
kinds
of
things
but
this
is
decent
for
fruit
beers
i
like
shiners
prickly
pear
beer
better
but
this
beats
the
hell
out
of
new
belgiums
attempt
at
frambozen
bier
i
like
how
the
dry
character
does
not
detract
from
the
peachiness
and
how
the
peachiness
goes
well
with
this
sour
beer
with
a
slightly
biscuity
backbone
its
a
good
alternative
to
fruit
flavoured
beers
that
have
more
of
a
sweet
yeasty
backbone
maybe
not
the
best
choice
for
my
first
review
since
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
but
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
will
have
to
try
more
of
the
style
to
get
more
of
a
feel
for
it
didnt
knock
me
out
of
my
seat
however
perhaps
i
will
try
it
again
next
summer
because
it
seems
like
a
very
nice
summer
beer
this
was
on
clearance
for
the
end
of
the
season
and
had
caught
my
eye
a
few
times
before
so
i
figured
id
get
it
before
its
gone
not
an
authentic
berliner
but
kind
of
interesting
in
its
own
right
would
choose
another
example
of
the
style
for
next
time
though
overall
i
like
it
the
four
pack
is
expensive
so
i
probably
will
not
purchase
again
it
is
a
fun
twist
on
the
berliner
weisse
style
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
but
i
dont
see
myself
adding
it
to
the
regular
lineup
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
its
a
super
easy
drinking
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
on
a
porch
in
the
heat
or
on
the
beach
on
a
boat
anywhere
really
where
its
warm
and
preferably
sandy
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
it
that
way
in
order
to
appreciate
it
its
not
going
to
warm
you
up
in
the
winter
or
fill
you
up
like
a
stout
thats
not
what
this
beer
was
intended
to
do
and
it
makes
no
bones
about
it
the
festina
peche
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
was
bready
and
malty
with
a
slight
tartness
and
bit
of
peach
the
taste
started
with
a
light
tartness
up
front
that
gives
way
to
ripe
peach
flavors
that
has
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
the
wheat
beer
flavors
were
subtle
but
came
through
on
the
end
and
lingered
on
my
palate
the
festina
peche
is
not
an
overly
sweet
beer
but
the
peach
adds
a
subtle
sweetness
to
this
sour
beer
overall
the
it
was
a
good
berliner
weisse
that
highlights
and
is
accentuated
by
the
peach
flavors
overall
nicely
crafted
very
refreshing
perfect
for
summer
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
cool
down
on
a
hot
day
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
but
i
could
drink
it
again
o
excited
to
see
a
fruit
version
of
an
underrepresented
style

nice

of

with
solid

and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
and
very
sessionable
offering
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
definitely
one
of
the
better
berliner
weisse
beers
out
there
however
it
did
let
me
down
a
bit
given
the
hype
not
quite
the
beer
of
the
summer
but
definitely
worth
getting
several
times
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
refreshing
summer
beer
a
great
start
to
what
should
be
a
beaut
of
a
weekend
tried
this
based
on
a
recommendation
from
the
beer
store
employee
i
wont
be
doing
that
again
the
appearance
on
the
pour
was
fine
everything
went
down
hill
and
fast
at
the
smell
needless
to
say
it
smelled
like
vomit
and
literally
tasted
like
it
to
be
fair
i
had
the
girlfriend
and
an
unsuspecting
neighbor
try
it
to
validate
my
opinion
the
neighbor
was
compensated
for
the
agony
consensus
was
the
same
all
the
way
around
save
your
money
and
appetite
try
something
else
o
i
gotta
say
this
is
a
disappointing
beliner
i
get
not
real
tartsour
and
the
overall
is
just
like
a
flavored
soda
water
not
a
fan
i
wanted
to
like
this
and
i
know
that
people
like
syrup
to
cut
the
sourness
but
this
feel
flat
for
me
sorry
dogfish
head
festina
pêche
45
i
was
confused
when
i
saw
on
beer
advocate
that
the
style
is
berliner
weissbier
ive
had
a
berliner
and
this
was
nothing
like
it
dogfishs
festina
peche
is
well
crafted
but
not
necessarily
something
im
going
to
seek
out
specifically
because
of
the
sour
taste
onot
as
tart
as
i
would
like
for
a
berliner
weisse
peach
flavor
is
nice
though
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
too
fizzy
and
too
much
peach
the
sweetness
from
the
peach
detracts
a
bit
from
the
tartness
yes
that
is
the
point
but
not
to
my
preference
overall
this
is
probably
not
the
best
example
of
a
berliner
weiss
but
its
an
overall
enjoyable
experience
this
is
one
of
the
few
peach
beers
i
have
had
that
were
not
cloyingly
sweet
the
balance
between
tart
and
sweet
flavors
is
just
right
i
would
also
claim
that
this
is
a
great
beer
for
introducing
people
to
the
style
and
perhaps
one
that
can
satisfy
a
staunch
wine
drinker
overall
a
fruit
ale
that
doesnt
skimp
on
peach
flavour
refreshing
and
crisp
perfect
compliment
for
the
summer
season
overall
a
personal
favorite
and
one
i
hope
stays
in
the
seasonal
rotation
overall
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
its
just
a
little
too
sour
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
im
not
going
to
be
looking
for
more
this
isnt
a
bad
berliner
i
enjoy
the
aggressive
maltiness
theres
decent
tartness
and
the
peach
is
subtle
but
pleasant
this
enters
my
very
tiny
list
of
dogfish
head
biers
i
actually
thought
tasted
good
and
werent
just
interesting
ideas
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
greenish
yellow
pretty
translucent
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
peach
with
very
slight
grain
tastes
of
peaches
but
not
fresh
ones
more
like
canned
ones
with
fizzy
water
beer
is
light
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
with
heavy
carbonation
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
mouthfeel
has
a
big
carbonation
typical
for
the
style
big
sticky
body
from
the
malt
and
sour
ojust
not
my
thing
o
im
not
sure
why
im
not
digging
this
it
has
the
fruitforward
tartness
i
like
from
a
good
sour
without
the
ridiculous
price
point
i
dont
know
this
one
doesnt
come
together
the
way
i
wanted
it
to
my
first
sampling
of
the
style
and
it
wont
be
my
last
this
one
though
i
dont
need
to
have
again
taste
like
pilsner
malt
with
tart
peach
finishes
like
yeast
not
a
fan
overall
a
very
poor
beer
o
it
seems
like
this
used
to
be
a
lot
better
theres
not
much
fruit
flavor
and
that
doesnt
help
the
acidity
not
too
bad
but
very
average
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
like
fresh
cut
hay
head
is
white
and
about
a
thumbs
width
theres
hardly
any
lacing
and
it
smells
strongly
of
peaches
very
sweet
and
musty
smelling
theres
also
some
wheat
and
funky
aromas
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
tart
at
first
then
predominantly
peachy
the
tartness
level
is
not
very
strong
but
its
enough
i
think
its
a
lot
less
funky
than
the
aroma
and
is
very
refreshing
overall
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
berliner
and
a
pretty
successful
one
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
my
jester
king
snifter
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
very
fizzy
translucent
gold
aroma
is
tart
peach
and
biscuit
taste
is
disappointing
very
thin
with
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
the
poach
flavor
tastes
almost
fake
beer
is
dry
but
needs
more
tartness
to
cut
through
the
underwhelming
old
bread
finish
the
look
and
mouthfeel
are
above
average
poured
out
a
32oz
growler
into
my
bhb
tulip
glass
pours
a
nice
clean
yellow
color
fizzy
white
head
that
is
gone
fairly
quickly
smell
is
clean
some
sour
notes
but
not
a
ton
of
peach
on
the
nose
flavor
is
very
tart
sour
nice
not
a
ton
of
peach
flavor
coming
through
but
i
kind
of
welcome
the
subtle
nature
of
it
once
the
sour
flavors
back
off
there
is
a
really
biscuit
tone
to
the
finish
of
the
beer
i
really
like
this
tart
refreshing
great
finish
not
as
tart
or
dry
as
some
and
a
bit
heavy
and
hot
for
the
style
but
a
great
departure
from
the
usual
styles
and
pretty
refreshing
flavor
is
a
little
more
peach
than
expected
but
pretty
good
as
a
whole
o
pretty
nice
and
refreshing
a
bit
more
tartness
like
that
in
perennials
peach
berliner
would
bring
it
up
but
i
dont
mind
this
at
all
sometimes
i
enjoy
dfh
beers
which
are
different
but
not
great
this
beer
is
great
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
and
find
it
to
be
damn
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
your
way
to
seek
this
one
out
what
a
fantastic
pour
the
effervescent
nature
of
festina
is
the
first
thing
that
caught
my
senses
it
had
a
longer
than
average
burst
of
carbonation
looking
more
like
champagne
than
beer
the
head
was
a
fantastic
2
fingers
of
white
clouds
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
discern
any
peach
in
the
aroma
although
i
did
find
peach
and
a
citrus
punch
with
my
first
sip
this
is
an
easy
drinker
not
very
bitter
at
all
with
a
lingering
semisour
finish
the
peach
flavor
definitely
comes
to
life
at
the
end
wine
enthusiasts
would
love
this
one
on
a
side
note
my
wife
just
had
a
sip
and
her
entire
face
puckered
up
shes
not
a
fan
of
anything
sour
overall
a
wonderful
summer
beer
but
perhaps
not
the
one
for
you
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
a
bit
of
a
pucker
factor
still
highly
refreshing
and
drinkable
ill
look
forward
to
my
second
bottle
with
nothing
to
base
the
beer
on
for
the
style
im
left
with
my
own
personal
tastes
its
defiintely
good
and
interesting
the
peach
is
a
little
much
at
times
almost
cloying
but
i
gather
that
is
sort
of
how
its
supposed
to
be
so
i
guess
thats
good
do
i
like
it
sure
do
i
love
it
nah
will
i
try
more
berliner
weiss
absolutely
great
hot
day
beer
a
nice
berliner
weisse
tart
and
nicely
peachy
a
great
summer
beer
low
abv
great
refreshment
on
a
hot
day
kudos
to
dogfish
head
for
another
interesting
brew
i
dont
really
see
the
problem
with
this
beer
a
really
fun
take
on
the
berliner
weisse
a
great
summer
beer
overall
was
ok
wont
buy
it
again
was
expecting
more
sweet
peach
then
sour
unripe
over
carbonated
o
i
had
this
one
a
couple
times
and
did
not
like
it
but
i
feel
like
the
sour
peach
is
not
as
strong
as
i
remember
nothing
i
would
seek
out
but
not
terrible
either
almost
a
mild
sour
beer
with
a
good
acidity
peach
was
at
a
perfect
level
enjoyable
overall
despite
the
poor
appearance
its
a
very
nice
summer
beer
overall
for
what
it
is
it
delivers
and
it
probably
delivers
better
than
most
others
of
this
style
but
this
is
not
one
that
i
would
personally
seek
out
again
o
i
think
this
might
be
my
first
berliner
weissbier
interesting
definitely
a
nice
summer
beer
another
good
one
from
dfh
i
think
it
might
be
my
favorite
of
their
seasonals
overall
i
love
peaches
but
i
cannot
stand
overly
sweet
peach
beers
this
was
not
that
and
outstanding
this
could
very
well
become
a
go
to
brew
for
our
6
month
summers
bravo
o
its
always
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
one
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
and
this
entry
doesnt
disappoint
this
is
an
exuberant
drink
its
not
explosive
in
its
fruit
character
but
it
is
clean
and
tart
the
fruit
did
sweeten
as
the
beer
warmed
but
not
to
the
measure
of
an
ipa
the
strong
wheat
based
malt
character
gave
enough
bread
to
create
a
balance
you
could
literally
observe
i
would
call
it
a
liberated
taste
othis
is
a
fairly
simple
but
decenttasting
summer
beer
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
berliner
weiss
tartness
to
offset
the
sweet
peach
flavor
but
this
brew
is
not
syrupy
or
cloying
the
light
body
and
chunky
carbonation
make
for
easy
drinkability
and
solid
refreshment
fruit
beers
arent
always
my
thing
but
this
is
not
a
bad
effort

beers

but
this
is

the
smell
is
of
a
dry
peach
and
it
almost
looks
like
a
champagne
with
the
light
color
and
little
bubbles
the
beer
has
a
forward
flavor
of
a
sour
peach
followed
up
by
a
pilsner
malt
aside
i
dont
think
thats
the
style
of
it
but
has
that
note
the
mouthfeel
is
odd
both
thick
and
thin
but
overall
worth
a
try
for
a
neat
summer
experience
simply
put
this
was
basically
a
cider
to
me
from
the
color
to
the
taste
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
the
smell
was
the
best
part
of
this
even
that
was
slightly
underwhelming
the
first
beer
from
dfh
i
can
say
i
will
not
try
again
135
calories
4
5
abv
peach
fruit
flavor
and
aftertaste
is
a
good
level
under
this
category
i
enjoyed
trying
something
out
of
the
ordinary
the
price
is
a
bit
much
though
at
only
4
bottles
for
9
this
is
a
seasonal
beer
and
worth
a
try
but
not
one
i
would
list
on
my
top
10
which
is
determined
by
taste
abv
and
cost
the
pour
was
interesting
when
done
pouring
it
almost
reminded
me
of
a
champaign
with
the
carbonation
streaming
up
from
the
botom
of
the
taster
glass
with
no
head
what
so
ever
the
aroma
to
me
was
almost
bready
with
a
slight
hint
of
peach
the
taste
was
more
like
a
very
dry
peach
cider
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
at
all
and
think
dfh
missed
the
mark
but
kudos
for
trying
overall
its
not
my
favorite
was
expecting
more
than
just
an
onslaught
of
peaches
glad
i
only
got
1
bottle
lightly
tart
and
dry
on
the
tongue
this
beer
just
comes
together
very
nicely
altogether
creamy
and
consistently
crisp
with
a
flowing
smoothness
underneath
before
upping
the
dryness
a
touch
into
the
finish
the
feel
is
surprisingly
good
pours
like
a
light
wit
beer
decent
white
head
and
looks
pretty
fizzy
you
can
smell
the
peach
instantly
along
with
a
sort
of
musty
smell
tastes
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
it
does
have
almost
a
chardonnay
tangy
finish
which
im
not
wild
about
but
it
doesnt
ruin
it
im
not
a
fruit
in
the
beer
type
drinker
but
on
a
hot
day
id
reach
for
this
over
a
peach
tea
the
abv
is
great
since
it
doesnt
eat
up
much
beer
credits
i
cant
see
having
this
regularly
but
it
might
be
something
i
offer
at
bbqs
in
the
summer
not
bad
enjoyed
this
from
a
tulip
12oz
for
3
49
appearance
is
reminiscent
of
white
wine
with
a
stark
white
head
that
retained
longer
than
expected
this
offering
is
effervescent
with
a
body
more
winelike
than
beerlike
the
peaches
are
distinctly
present
in
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
the
sour
peach
taste
is
refreshing
and
light
but
distinct
as
well
this
beer
delivers
on
its
promise
and
is
a
good
example
of
style
poured
this
berliner
weissbier
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
produced
an
average
white
head
featured
nice
retention
just
a
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
ale
was
very
nice
bursting
with
fresh
peach
nectar
some
suggestions
of
malted
wheat
medium
bodied
this
ale
features
a
baseline
of
malted
wheat
that
gives
way
to
a
sour
peach
nectar
and
granny
smith
apples
the
favorite
part
of
this
beer
for
me
is
the
sour
bite
you
get
about
midway
through
that
sour
bite
gives
way
to
a
dry
finish
that
leaves
you
ready
for
the
next
sip
very
nice
session
beer
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
thanks
dogfish
another
winner
prost
o
fizzy
refreshing
dry
peach
beer
appeared
more
like
an
extra
dry
peach
wine
for
me
except
for
the
lower
abv
of
course
a
pleasant
experience
definitively
worth
trying
but
not
really
my
type
of
beer
o
a
really
neat
light
fruity
beer
that
captures
the
character
of
peaches
without
being
obnoxious
this
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
to
share
with
friends
that
dont
care
for
more
bitter
beers
havent
tried
too
many
of
this
style
but
i
looking
forward
to
it
o
i
had
this
beer
once
at
the
brewery
and
really
enjoyed
it
it
seems
that
some
time
in
the
bottle
has
made
this
seem
a
little
less
bright
and
refreshing
but
it
still
holds
a
lot
of
juicy
peach
flavors
a
nice
warmweather
type
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
although
my
problem
is
a
slightly
medicinal
and
chalkiness
that
i
prefer
to
not
have
in
my
beers
good
tartness
and
sweetness
throughout
although
the
peach
flavoring
can
come
of
as
impure
or
contrived
still
decent
though
o
this
is
one
of
my
goto
summer
brews
very
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
fantastic
representation
of
peaches
never
disappoints
highly
recommended
o
a
very
easy
drinking
berliner
probably
the
only
one
i
have
found
that
i
could
drink
as
a
session
however
it
is
not
exactly
as
tart
as
i
expect
i
have
had
this
one
before
and
would
definitely
seek
it
out
again
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
for
a
change
of
pace
overall
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
an
excellent
beer
for
the
summer
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
and
would
seek
it
and
recommend
it
the
next
time
i
buy
it
the
next
summer
perhaps
also
like
i
said
being
highly
drinkable
you
could
have
a
whole
4
pack
in
a
single
session
after
a
good
meal
or
just
to
cool
down
in
a
hot
afternoon
its
entirely
possible
thanks
to
its
low
ibu
and
lower
abv
taste
peachy
bitterness
ascorbic
acid
dry
and
active
carbonation
peach
lingers
on
the
palate
lambic
bitterness
little
citrus
pinch
when
visiting
a
dogfish
head
alehouse
i
was
given
the
recommendation
to
mix
the
festina
peche
with
their
90
minute
ipa
this
is
perhaps
the
wisest
thing
i
have
ever
done
and
my
wife
greatly
appreciated
it
for
most
people
that
do
not
drink
a
lot
of
ipa
they
are
turned
off
by
the
excessive
hop
taste
being
from
seattle
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
such
thing
with
mixing
in
the
festina
peche
it
cut
away
at
the
excessive
hop
flavor
without
taking
away
from
the
essence
of
the
ipa
it
was
easy
on
the
palette
yet
went
down
like
an
ipa
i
liked
it
so
much
i
got
a
growler
filled
with
23
90
minute
ipa
and
13
festina
peche
o
crisp
tart
flavors
push
the
profile
over
the
safety
line
of
common
summer
brews
and
im
glad
for
it
overall
a
great
beer
i
think
peach
is
my
favorite
fruit
flavor
for
a
beer
and
this
beer
has
inspired
me
to
try
some
peach
lambics
just
a
great
summertime
brew
gracias
dogfish
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
berliner
weissbier
style
im
a
big
fan
of
lambics
oud
bruins
and
the
like
i
didnt
find
it
quite
as
refreshing
as
other
reviewers
o
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
again
there
ar
eother
peach
flavored
beers
i
prefer
more
rj
rockers
son
of
the
peach
and
ccb
peach
jaialai
i
poured
this
oddball
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
and
watched
a
big
white
creamy
head
appear
then
i
watched
the
big
white
creamy
head
go
away
the
beer
was
cloudy
unfiltered
looking
and
very
blond
extreme
sour
peach
taste
blows
the
taste
buds
away
but
not
really
in
a
bad
way
it
certainly
is
different
and
im
sure
that
was
the
intent
pretty
decent
for
a
taste
chance
on
a
hot
summer
day
make
sure
the
beer
is
colder
than
45
o
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
afternoon
easy
drinking
the
peach
aroma
is
good
o
good
beer
but
for
the
price
and
it
being
dfh
a
little
annoying
lightly
haze
pale
blonde
colour
one
finger
of
white
head
with
some
lace
smell
is
heavy
on
sweet
peaches
a
bit
like
a
fuzzy
peach
gummy
with
some
lemon
malts
and
acidic
apple
notes
taste
is
quite
peachy
and
lightly
tart
some
fruity
apple
and
lemon
flavours
a
little
maltystraw
points
with
more
peach
in
finish
medium
carbonation
lightmedium
body
nice
mouthfeel
not
bad
and
fairly
easy
drinking
but
that
being
said
one
was
good
for
me
while
something
i
could
drink
i
probably
wont
be
buying
much
of
this
overall
well
marketed
to
the
american
summer
crowd
but
its
not
really
working
for
me
although
berliner
weissbers
arent
generally
my
cup
of
tea
so
take
my
rating
with
a
grain
of
salt
not
particularly
light
or
refreshing
and
im
not
getting
much
peach
although
i
applaud
dfh
for
trying
perhaps
im
spoiled
by
jester
kings
bonnie
the
rare
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
its
an
awesome
introduction
to
berliner
weissbiers
it
is
perfectly
tart
and
not
overwhelmingly
sour
at
all
very
tasty
drinkable
and
refreshing
perfect
for
the
summer
this
pours
a
very
bright
very
light
gold
color
with
a
creamy
halfinch
head
peaches
come
through
very
clearly
in
the
nosewith
nothing
else
detectable
flavor
is
very
nice
though
i
am
very
happy
its
not
overly
sweet
in
fact
despite
the
pear
flavor
theres
no
accompanying
sweetness
really
its
very
wellattenuated
with
a
nice
lactic
tartness
a
really
delightfully
refreshing
beer
tastes
of
the
same
fruit
malt
beverage
of
the
type
very
nice
flavor
of
peach
with
a
tart
hit
and
then
dries
juicy
my
second
try
of
this
beverage
i
like
it
better
this
time
fine
line
between
fruit
and
vinegar
if
you
can
imagine
but
i
dig
i
poured
this
one
into
a
tall
pint
glass
it
has
a
pale
straw
color
body
with
no
head
or
lace
to
it
the
smell
is
of
nice
peach
and
wheat
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
tartness
first
then
the
peach
flavor
comes
in
it
has
a
dry
finish
to
italmost
like
a
white
wine
its
mouth
feel
is
a
little
rough
on
the
tonuge
with
a
little
bit
of
a
after
taste
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
o
tasty
although
best
enjoyed
when
paired
with
cheese
and
crackers
like
you
would
with
a
dry
white
wine
rather
than
consumed
on
its
own
for
unpaired
consumption
it
is
just
a
little
too
tart
but
since
i
am
a
big
cheese
fan
i
will
be
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
the
next
chance
i
get
review
from
82010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
light
orangestraw
amber
light
fruit
and
wheat
aroma
sour
up
front
phasing
into
an
acidic
wheat
flavor
wheat
and
light
peach
flavors
in
the
middle
ends
tart
interesting
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
too
sour
for
me
although
true
to
style
fizzy
yellow
pour
but
not
a
regular
fizzy
type
beer
upon
closer
inspection
there
is
some
cloudiness
in
the
appearance
vs
what
you
might
see
from
other
beers
of
similar
color
smell
is
light
citrusy
and
not
your
typical
dfh
beer
great
change
of
pace
and
perfect
for
summer
sessions
low
abv
crisp
purposely
slight
sour
and
definite
peach
on
the
backend
should
be
very
well
respected
for
the
combination
of
taste
yet
no
compromise
on
ingredients
i
can
not
say
i
am
a
guru
of
berliner
weissbier
since
this
is
literally
the
only
one
in
texas
i
can
get
my
hands
on
but
what
i
have
had
is
plenty
of
sours
in
general
this
beer
is
not
as
over
the
top
in
sourness
as
you
see
a
lot
instead
it
is
mellow
highly
refreshing
and
fruity
it
really
almost
drinks
like
a
soda
highly
addicting
the
peach
definately
adds
a
nice
balanced
flavor
to
it
o
a
great
summer
time
brew
refreshing
and
perfect
for
beating
the
heat
well
rounded
and
lightly
tart
this
delicious
peachiness
could
be
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
on
a
90
summer
day
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenlimeyellow
colour
with
fluffy
white
head
tastes
of
peach
up
front
with
some
slight
lemon
and
bready
malts
coming
through
in
the
finish
didnt
find
this
to
be
that
sour
overall
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
an
insane
sessionable
beer
glad
i
have
two
bottles
of
this
left
overall
not
to
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
great
for
summer
like
the
bottle
says
the
peach
juice
adds
some
nice
distinct
characterisitcs
to
the
beer
a
refreshing
sessionable
beer
for
a
hot
day
dogfish
head
takes
a
very
under
appreciated
style
from
germany
and
puts
their
own
unique
stamp
on
it
the
naturally
tart
berliner
weissbier
style
is
traditionally
sweetened
in
the
bar
with
woodruff
or
raspberry
syrup
so
dogfish
saves
you
the
trouble
and
ferments
the
beer
with
peach
juice
i
personally
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
tart
and
sour
but
the
beer
definitely
serves
its
purpose
of
being
a
perfectly
refreshing
summer
drink
recommended
anyone
who
wants
to
try
a
summer
seasonal
that
definitely
separates
itself
from
the
trite
myriad
of
summer
beers
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
didnt
know
it
was
a
sour
and
thought
it
was
an
awful
beer
its
funny
what
expectations
can
do
to
you
senses
i
thought
of
a
summer
peach
wheat
thing
and
was
disappointed
fast
forward
a
few
years
ive
learned
what
sours
are
learned
to
love
them
and
learned
to
read
the
description
now
i
look
forward
to
getting
a
pack
or
two
of
this
beer
when
its
released
taste
follows
the
smell
peach
is
heavy
and
tartness
is
pronounced
tartness
mellows
toward
the
end
and
finishes
more
sweet
peach
mouth
feel
is
very
crisp
and
fruity
very
refreshing
and
light
on
the
tongue
a
very
good
fruit
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
looks
like
a
white
beer
aromas
are
funky
peachy
wheaty
grassy
herbal
tastes
are
sour
grape
peach
wheatcrab
apple
and
super
tart
especially
on
the
finish
body
is
light
with
extra
carbonation
finishes
crisp
tart
and
dry
overall
not
one
id
go
back
to
for
a
third
time
but
it
was
good
to
go
back
to
it
and
realize
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
initially
thought
it
was
its
definitely
a
love
it
or
hate
it
beer
a
hazy
sandy
color
with
a
white
head
an
aroma
of
some
peach
wheat
and
hay
flavor
followed
suit
with
some
tartness
some
sweetness
from
the
peach
and
some
funky
hayearthiness
in
the
finish
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
i
tend
to
not
be
much
of
a
fan
of
dogfish
heads
offerings
but
i
definitely
was
a
fan
of
this
one
would
happily
drink
again
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
yet
to
sample
but
i
still
cannot
quite
get
behind
it
other
beers
simply
offer
more
beerlike
flavor
in
my
opinion
for
a
lover
of
peaches
regardless
of
their
beer
palette
this
is
one
they
are
destined
to
try
mouthfeel
lighter
body
with
fizzy
tickling
carbonation
drying
finish
peach
tartness
throughout
its
nothing
over
the
top
nor
does
it
have
much
complexity
but
its
unique
and
thats
what
dfh
does
checked
old
reviews
first
time
ive
tried
since
the
08
batch
which
i
apparently
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
o
a
very
good
beer
and
one
ill
most
definitely
seek
out
again
given
low
abv
light
tart
taste
and
nice
mouth
feel
i
could
easily
see
buying
a
4
pack
of
these
for
a
long
hot
summer
afternoon
session
my
first
dfh
experience
and
a
very
good
one
12
oz
bottle
pours
golden
with
a
short
lived
white
head
and
champaign
like
carbonation
aroma
is
of
peach
wheat
malt
some
funky
yeast
body
is
medium
and
very
acidic
taste
is
very
sour
yeast
peach
and
pale
malt
long
acidic
finish
tough
to
drink
without
a
syrup
o
great
session
beer
for
a
hot
day
the
sweet
fruit
flavor
would
make
this
great
with
a
chopped
or
grilled
chicken
salad
maybe
even
a
ricotta
cheesecake
will
definitely
have
it
again
when
i
can
smells
like
wet
grass
tastes
like
sorrel
know
what
sorrel
tastes
like
yep
sweetarts
o
tastes
like
alcoholic
peach
soda
i
love
peaches
but
this
is
a
little
too
weird
for
me
usually
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
dfh
saves
the
style
for
me
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
creamy
white
head
aroma
of
sour
lemons
wheat
some
peach
sweetness
the
peaches
come
out
nicely
in
this
to
balance
out
the
sour
flavor
but
do
not
overpower
or
make
it
syrupy
flavor
is
sweet
and
sour
with
light
body
and
medium
high
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
would
go
nicely
on
a
summer
day
mouthfeel
drinkability
perfectly
sour
and
delightfully
fresh
ive
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
but
this
is
the
freshest
bottle
i
believe
ive
had
the
peaches
are
truly
fresh
and
delicious
active
carbonation
all
throughout
o
i
must
admit
i
went
into
this
beer
prepared
not
to
like
it
i
also
must
admit
that
i
was
wrong
for
a
style
that
just
doesnt
bring
much
to
the
table
dfh
did
this
one
right
easy
drinking
very
summer
friendly
and
with
a
nice
taste
to
boot
i
think
this
will
find
its
place
in
my
damn
its
hot
and
im
thirsty
rotation
well
done
m
light
bodied
and
refreshing
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
appreciate
this
one
and
certainly
recommend
it
to
those
looking
for
a
lighter
different
style
on
a
summer
afternoon
i
guess
i
was
just
expecting
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
and
kick
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
there
are
much
better
things
to
try
this
summer
o
great
beer
i
am
not
familar
with
berliner
weissbier
this
is
my
second
one
and
i
kind
of
like
it
perfect
summer
drink
imo
odthis
beer
does
not
get
the
credit
it
deserves
i
would
say
i
only
like
one
of
every
five
or
six
dogfish
head
beers
i
try
this
is
undoubtedly
one
of
their
best
offerings
in
my
opinion
natural
peach
flavors
and
even
some
decent
tartness
this
is
easily
a
top3
dfh
beer
by
far
for
me
all
in
all
not
the
best
offering
for
dfh
but
still
a
nice
creative
effort
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
it
down
again
but
definitely
wouldnt
say
no
to
a
glass
o
highly
sessionable
at
4
5
abv
this
is
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
overall
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
it
isnt
bad
just
doesnt
do
an
awful
lot
for
me
somewhat
hohum
so
while
there
are
worse
things
to
drink
its
not
one
ill
be
seeking
out
again
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
easier
drinking
berliner
weisse
that
is
very
nice
for
the
summer
months
when
you
are
looking
for
something
sour
and
tart
o
one
of
the
perfect
summer
beers
it
manages
to
be
light
yet
very
flavorful
it
really
amazes
me
as
to
how
much
dogfish
head
packs
into
this
beer
it
is
uses
the
peach
well
to
make
this
an
approachable
berliner
and
beer
overall
not
the
best
peach
beer
i
have
had
but
definitely
a
thirst
quencher
factoring
in
this
scorching
heat
this
summer
has
started
with
have
a
glass
on
me
salud
o
a
nice
and
refreshing
summer
beer
from
dogfish
head
thats
a
little
bit
different
but
still
very
good
this
is
a
very
fine
brew
one
of
dfhs
best
imo
refreshing
and
perfect
for
a
100
degree
day
this
beer
pleasantly
surprises
me
i
feared
the
peach
overwhelming
the
other
elements
of
the
beer
but
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
the
peach
is
present
but
not
dominant
overall
a
very
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
and
one
of
my
first
of
this
style
id
like
to
try
out
some
more
and
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
poured
a
foggy
yeasty
pale
gold
with
lots
of
head
smell
was
slightly
pungent
and
at
the
same
time
dry
and
a
little
fruity
taste
was
very
light
peach
flavor
dry
and
not
bitter
with
a
softly
sour
finish
i
expected
more
on
the
fruit
but
it
was
very
faint
for
me
not
a
big
sour
fan
so
my
score
is
on
the
low
side
mouthfeel
was
great
but
this
was
a
one
and
done
for
me
thanks
to
my
local
store
manager
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
o
a
very
tasty
low
abv
fruit
beer
definitely
worth
having
again
o
pretty
good
theres
more
of
a
lemon
yogurt
like
tartness
than
peach
its
not
very
sweet
though
i
was
expecting
more
peach
sweetness
its
a
good
summer
session
beer
since
its
relatively
light
and
low
abv
the
thing
about
dogfish
is
that
for
the
price
im
paying
10
and
change
for
a
4
pack
it
should
be
more
memorable
still
pretty
good
o
overall
it
was
pretty
good
it
has
the
light
body
youd
expect
from
a
berliner
weiss
but
the
beer
is
too
safe
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
refreshing
subtle
in
flavor
fruity
tangy
perfect
for
a
hot
day
if
youre
expecting
something
like
aprihop
dont
this
is
very
subtle
and
not
hoppy
im
surprised
this
beer
is
so
lowly
rated
after
all
sam
has
his
face
on
every
beer
magazine
and
even
a
now
cancelled
nationally
sindicated
show
doesnt
that
make
the
beer
rate
higher
nonetheless
the
beer
is
still
very
enjoyable
it
had
subtle
sour
and
subtle
peach
flavors
i
didnt
pick
up
much
berliner
weissesqu
yeastiness
but
i
found
this
beer
thirstquenching
on
a
hot
day
a
summer
goto
beer
can
be
consumed
by
the
case
perfect
for
daydrinking
finishing
up
my
glass
before
430pm
a
perennial
classic
and
one
of
best
from
dfh
cheers
this
is
an
odd
beer
for
me
its
not
great
when
held
up
against
other
beers
of
the
style
but
its
very
enjoyable
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
tart
pale
ale
than
a
berliner
weisse
very
nice
summer
beer
overall
a
different
but
enjoyable
beer
not
sure
it
is
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
it
is
refreshing
in
hot
weather
and
a
nice
alternative
to
typical
wheat
beers
o
not
as
tartsour
as
many
of
the
other
beers
in
this
style
the
peach
really
helps
to
balance
that
out
still
it
is
a
good
example
of
an
easily
accessible
berliner
weissbier
i
find
this
beer
especially
easy
to
drink
on
hot
summer
days
and
it
is
quite
refreshing
taste
is
of
wheaty
malty
peach
its
refreshing
light
and
nice
tasting
one
of
the
best
fruity
berliner
weissbiers
i
have
ver
had
one
or
two
is
good
but
i
cant
do
much
more
nice
summer
brew
though
the
infusion
of
peach
flavor
into
a
berlinerweiss
works
well
as
the
peach
flavor
complements
the
tartness
very
nicely
botg
70
a
new
beer
available
to
houston
dont
think
we
have
gotten
this
in
bottle
form
before
now
on
shelves
poured
from
bottle
into
dfh
snifter
pours
a
really
light
yelloworange
color
some
cloudiness
but
the
carbonation
is
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
looks
really
effervescent
not
much
head
this
is
dfhs
take
on
a
berliner
weiss
as
far
as
i
know
smell
peach
sweet
ripe
peach
skins
like
you
had
a
very
fresh
peach
sitting
in
the
palm
of
your
hand
taste
nice
tart
somewhat
sour
start
followed
by
the
peach
sweetness
nice
dry
finish
with
tight
carbonation
this
beer
is
absolutely
perfect
for
a
summer
day
and
a
really
interesting
take
on
the
berlinerweiss
style
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
dfh
always
an
interesting
interpretation
and
spin
on
things
ill
buy
this
a
lot
this
summer
if
it
stays
around
good
stuff
o
its
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
not
quite
offcentered
enough
for
me
to
come
back
to
this
one
o
this
to
me
is
not
the
best
beer
from
dogfish
head
it
just
doesnt
hit
the
spot
that
i
was
hoping
this
beer
is
very
nice
though
after
working
outside
all
day
o
a
true
sour
no
a
refreshing
and
superior
alternative
to
the
offerings
from
macro
lagers
yes
another
wellcrafted
and
exceptional
offering
from
dogfish
head
another
purchase
is
in
order
before
the
season
is
exhausted
overall
its
an
ok
beer
at
best
again
i
got
a
very
sour
aspect
and
that
was
about
the
extent
of
it
makes
a
great
summer
beer
its
an
easy
drinker
o
one
of
the
best
and
most
interesting
summer
beers
i
have
had
o
a
refreshing
beer
i
could
drink
100
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
day
peach
is
about
as
fruity
as
id
care
for
in
a
real
beer
but
done
very
well
it
is
a
real
fruit
flavor
and
it
feels
like
it
fits
in
with
the
beer
not
like
more
beers
which
feel
like
theyve
added
fruit
as
an
afterthought
overall
impressions
while
not
quite
a
berliner
weisse
a
damn
good
offering
from
dfh
love
this
as
a
summer
seasonal
pours
very
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
bubbles
rising
fast
from
the
bottom
of
my
tulip
smells
like
white
wine
tart
and
clean
with
robust
peach
notes
flavor
is
very
peachy
but
not
sweet
or
anything
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
the
malt
profile
is
very
light
which
makes
this
very
drinkable
the
essence
of
peaches
is
beautiful
in
this
beer
nothing
artificial
about
it
at
all
feel
is
very
very
dry
in
the
mouth
refreshing
though
just
the
same
and
effervescently
carbonated
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
wish
they
would
put
in
6packs
instead
of
4packs
always
looking
for
one
or
two
more
when
i
buy
this
a
really
lovely
summer
beer
i
did
review
this
in
2010
and
gave
it
a
3
73
and
after
tasting
it
this
year
i
thought
it
was
better
than
my
old
review
stated
o
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
the
taste
is
great
but
the
nose
is
a
little
too
funky
for
me
it
has
great
peach
flavor
and
is
great
for
grilling
or
sitting
on
the
deck
though
i
think
ill
drink
the
last
3
out
of
the
bottle
to
lose
that
nose
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
2012
edition
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
short
lived
smaller
white
head
the
smells
are
definitely
of
peaches
not
much
else
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
little
sour
which
is
nice
plenty
of
peaches
good
stuff
o
i
know
its
not
as
tart
as
other
berliners
but
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
is
a
top
5
summer
day
option
for
me
a
solid
take
on
the
style
and
definitely
deserves
to
be
in
the
summer
rotation
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
have
only
had
bells
oarsmen
before
so
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
style
but
this
is
the
first
one
i
have
tried
that
i
actually
enjoyed
so
that
speaks
for
itself
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
with
some
interesting
flavors
to
hold
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
warm
day
outside
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
solid
all
the
way
around
and
had
no
real
weak
points
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
price
its
a
little
to
pricey
to
buy
a
lot
of
and
it
wont
stay
on
the
shelf
long
i
might
buy
another
before
they
are
all
gone
but
for
the
price
i
might
be
more
interested
in
something
a
little
darker
or
stronger
but
i
do
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
this
was
another
good
and
solid
beer
from
dogfish
head
they
take
a
lot
of
risks
but
it
always
results
in
more
hits
then
misses
and
while
this
isnt
a
beer
that
i
just
have
to
have
its
nice
to
know
that
theres
no
reason
to
ignore
this
style
just
because
i
had
one
mediocre
experience
good
job
guys
this
is
one
tasty
beer
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
the
peach
is
nice
and
its
very
well
done
with
no
negatives
nice
light
refreshing
with
great
fruit
flavor
and
good
balance
but
at
a
high
cost
perfect
for
summer
but
its
a
beer
i
want
more
than
4
of
these
sessionable
low
abv
bad
boys
for
8
99
which
affects
the
score
a
tad
o
im
not
a
sours
fan
but
this
is
actually
pretty
tasty
id
like
more
peach
flavor
a
very
nice
refreshing
peach
berliner
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
overall
a
good
light
beer
with
a
good
flavor
that
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
would
be
great
for
warm
summer
days
and
will
pair
well
with
lighter
meals
sampled
from
a
sniffer
edit
this
beer
was
noticeably
different
when
it
was
issued
in
2013
the
sweetness
was
much
higher
the
funkiness
was
reduced
and
the
dry
finish
wasnt
as
dry
anymore
consequently
i
found
it
to
be
less
refreshing
and
less
interesting
overall
and
while
not
bad
by
any
means
i
knocked
the
score
down
a
little
bit
to
reflect
these
changes
a
great
summer
beer
or
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
darker
winter
beers
o
very
interesting
to
drink
this
with
so
much
age
seems
to
have
digressed
to
a
belgium
sour
but
unlike
anything
ive
tasted
before
while
delicious
and
unique
given
the
novelty
factor
i
still
prefer
this
style
fresh
otrue
to
style
with
a
nice
change
of
pace
going
to
the
peach
side
i
have
a
keg
of
homebrew
bw
in
the
basement
waiting
for
summer
maybe
i
will
add
fresh
peaches
the
beer
is
certainly
quaffable
but
does
not
flow
into
the
wheat
category
well
also
not
particularly
fruity
although
moreso
than
some
absolutely
not
a
berliner
weissbier
i
would
drink
again
and
this
is
probably
my
fifth
time
having
this
beer
but
i
would
simply
tell
most
folks
this
is
a
fruit
beer
that
is
slightly
tart
not
a
berliner
weissbier
it
is
thin
and
without
redeeming
quality
o
lots
of
flavor
and
thankfully
sour
enough
to
meet
my
needs
my
wife
likes
it
a
lot
too
we
talked
about
how
we
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
more
than
the
monks
cafe
flemish
red
which
is
sweeter
i
cannot
even
finish
the
bottle

overall
just
as
unmemorable
and
blah
as
i
remembered
from
the
bottle
even
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
less
than
enjoyable
pass
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
would
be
great
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
beer
is
pretty
odd
but
if
you
enjoy
fruitier
dry
beers
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
i
will
be
purchasing
more
o
as
i
said
average
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
nothing
too
amazing
but
very
drinkable
overall
impression
very
refreshing
berliner
weiss
the
peaches
were
fun
in
here
but
almost
gave
it
too
much
sweetness
if
it
wasnt
for
the
nice
puckeringgood
acidity
in
this
one
it
wouldnt
have
been
marked
so
highly
by
myself
if
available
in
mo
i
would
keep
a
fresh
1
or
2
of
these
in
the
fridge
for
the
ladies
to
enjoy
or
myself
o
good
a
or
so
not
excellent
but
certainly
one
to
pick
up
when
its
in
season
malt
beverage
brewed
with
peach
concentrate
o
great
beer
not
the
greatest
berlinerweissestyle
beer
out
there
for
sure
but
i
find
it
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
extremely
refreshing
during
the
hot
days
of
the
summer
the
peach
puree
blends
well
into
the
beer
adding
flavor
while
not
oversweetening
it
dr
drinkable
and
low
abv
but
also
low
quality
its
a
bankrupt
attempt
at
a
bankrupt
style
id
avoid
this
one
even
if
youre
a
hardcore
fan
of
either
the
brewery
or
the
style
o
the
smell
on
this
beer
is
wonderful
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
id
like
a
bit
more
juiciness
from
the
peach
and
a
bit
more
dry
and
sour
a
solid
beer
though
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
because
i
was
interested
in
it
however
im
glad
i
got
it
on
tap
i
would
never
pay
the
price
they
charge
for
a
4
pack
this
is
a
tough
style
to
nail
and
although
dfh
usually
can
put
down
those
trickier
styles
this
one
is
just
a
bit
uninspired
of
all
the
efforts
by
dogfish
head
i
believe
this
is
the
most
disappointing
drink
its
still
a
new
style
to
me
flavorful
and
new
i
am
a
big
dfh
fan
though
slightly
cloudy
and
a
very
light
yellow
with
a
small
head
tiny
bubbles
receding
into
a
wispy
ring
with
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
like
peaches
tastes
a
little
sweet
but
mostly
like
sour
peaches
its
not
musty
like
belgian
sours
which
i
think
is
the
reason
my
girlfriend
likes
it
too
i
wish
id
tried
this
before
they
switched
from
fresh
peaches
to
concentrate
but
its
still
a
great
light
refreshing
fruity
beer
o
first
of
the
style
for
me
have
yet
to
try
the
traditional
style
this
is
fantastic
and
refreshing
pours
a
light
golden
color
almost
like
strawblonde
wonderful
inch
of
foam
sits
atop
this
with
tight
even
bubbles
theres
a
big
peach
nose
on
this
or
what
id
imagine
peach
flowers
smell
likemuch
more
delicate
than
peaches
but
with
its
essence
preserved
comes
across
on
the
palate
as
well
very
light
carbonated
almost
champagnelike
mouthfeel
refreshing
and
delicious
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
dogfish
heads
best
offering
nice
to
enjoy
on
a
patio
o
o
have
always
been
on
the
fence
when
i
drink
this
style
sometimes
i
like
it
sometimes
im
not
a
fan
this
wasnt
bad
nice
tart
taste
but
not
overpowering
would
have
liked
some
more
flavor
from
the
peaches
though
not
a
bad
drink
not
sure
if
i
would
have
to
have
it
again
overall
3
0
maybe
im
an
idiot
but
i
remember
festina
pêche
being
much
much
tastier
in
the
past
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
actually
relatively
enjoyable
just
not
what
i
remember
or
was
expecting
i
imagine
this
is
more
like
what
a
straightahead
berliner
weisse
tastes
like
but
maybe
not
wish
there
was
some
more
ripe
sweet
peach
action
going
on
here
try
serving
it
in
place
of
champagne
sour
mouth
awesome
beer
odidnt
think
i
would
like
it
but
it
was
a
nice
summer
beer
the
appearance
was
nice
with
good
head
and
a
slightly
cloudy
light
yellow
colour
the
smell
i
got
was
citrus
peach
of
coarse
and
a
sourness
i
enjoyed
the
flavour
of
this
beer
because
there
was
just
hints
of
fruit
and
wheat
not
an
overpowering
taste
sour
finish
very
refreshing
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
would
say
its
very
good
for
a
fruit
beer
me
being
not
a
very
big
fan
of
those
types
overall
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewer
if
youre
like
me
and
avoided
it
because
it
might
be
too
fruity
you
should
try
it
this
is
a
very
sessionable
summer
beer
i
wish
i
had
picked
some
up
at
the
start
of
summer
od
not
bad
a
nice
tart
low
abv
beer
the
peach
flavour
is
fairly
light
but
works
well
to
compliment
the
acidity
and
lift
up
the
flavour
worth
a
shot
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
overall
a
decent
beer
either
a
hit
or
miss
if
its
in
your
local
market
pick
it
up
it
isnt
half
bad
poured
a
cloudy
light
golden
yellow
color
with
quick
disappearing
head
smells
faintly
of
peaches
taste
sour
and
tart
with
a
minimal
peach
flavor
this
beer
would
be
way
better
if
the
peaches
could
have
shined
through
just
a
tad
bit
more
goes
well
with
spicy
food
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
o
great
summertime
brew
crisp
while
still
flavorful
nice
tartness
that
i
really
enjoy
o
did
not
expect
a
berliner
weisse
style
from
this
beer
thought
it
was
different
but
not
really
anything
i
would
normally
drink
oive
tried
this
a
lot
the
first
few
times
i
didnt
enjoy
it
but
for
some
reason
i
kept
trying
it
im
glad
i
did
because
i
eventually
started
to
really
like
this
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
quaffable
beer
it
sure
is
thirst
quenching
notes
dfh
colored
a
little
bit
outside
the
lines
on
this
one
but
that
is
what
they
do
best
it
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
and
quite
creative
what
a
great
idea
for
a
summer
seasonal
festina
peche
started
out
pretty
well
but
then
ended
on
a
very
weird
and
funky
note
not
the
good
funk
either
but
the
strange
puckering
feeling
of
biting
into
a
peach
that
just
isnt
quite
fit
for
consumption
yet
i
know
dfh
has
a
reputation
for
pushing
the
envelope
so
i
dont
think
i
should
take
festina
peche
as
a
yardstick
of
what
a
berliner
weissbier
should
be
overall
im
just
so
so
on
this
beer
i
mean
its
nice
but
i
was
expecting
more
sour
and
more
peach
seems
like
a
good
midday
pickmeup
during
the
dog
days
of
summer
low
enough
in
alcohol
to
be
negligible
quenching
and
presumably
restorative
enough
funk
to
make
things
interesting
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
brazen
tartness
while
it
was
well
within
the
guidelines
of
the
style
this
beer
produced
flavoring
that
really
made
the
palate
sing
and
pucker
the
lactic
sourness
and
fruity
tartness
were
again
appropriate
but
effectively
took
away
from
the
peach
character
which
would
have
made
a
good
beer
even
better
if
given
the
chance
i
would
have
never
figured
a
berliner
would
have
over
a
thousand
reviews
thank
you
dogfish
head
for
making
that
possible
o
i
enjoy
this
one
on
hot
summer
nights
and
id
like
to
see
what
its
like
aged
for
a
year
or
so
it
is
somewhat
onedemensional
but
and
interesting
take
on
a
style
we
dont
get
much
of
in
the
states
its
really
easy
to
drink
and
i
like
the
sessionability
of
it
an
interesting
brew
just
wish
the
price
wasnt
so
high
for
a
4
5
beer
overall
i
guess
i
dont
have
the
fancy
palate
of
a
gueuze
or
lambic
drinker
one
who
enjoys
cantillon
to
appreciate
this
still
i
guess
its
a
cheap
offering
to
those
ridiculous
offerings
so
to
all
who
like
it
enjoy
o
i
honestly
dont
have
too
much
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
an
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
a
summer
evening
outside
i
also
dont
have
any
reason
to
love
this
beer
strong
showing
from
dfh
that
a
wheat
beer
fan
will
enjoy
overall
like
a
beer
version
of
a
bellini
a
refreshing
unique
summer
beer
will
drink
this
again
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
about
an
inch
of
pure
white
bubbly
head
smells
of
straw
faint
peach
citrus
some
sugar
and
a
slight
funk
honestly
not
as
much
peach
as
i
had
hoped
for
tastes
of
wheat
straw
tart
peach
and
some
lemon
the
emphasis
is
on
the
peach
and
this
carries
over
into
the
tart
dry
finish
again
i
had
hoped
for
more
peach
but
this
is
still
a
good
brew
overall
a
refreshing
offering
that
id
gladly
have
again
especially
in
this
inescapable
summer
heat
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
i
would
have
again
overall
once
again
dogfish
head
impresses
with
a
unique
beer
full
of
character
it
is
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
summer
beer
and
certainly
an
interesting
interpretation
of
a
lesserknown
style
my
only
qualm
with
it
is
that
the
sourness
does
impede
a
bit
on
the
beers
drinkability
however
i
havent
had
many
berliner
weissbiers
so
this
may
be
on
par
with
the
style
nevertheless
it
is
a
great
beer
and
definitely
something
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
i
will
definitely
drink
again
a
perfect
summer
evening
on
the
porch
type
of
beer
reminds
me
of
a
cider
but
far
more
interesting
and
quite
dry
a
very
nice
effort
from
the
boys
girls
at
dfh
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
yellowwhite
color
with
a
tiny
head
the
aroma
is
the
weak
part
it
mostly
smells
of
musty
fruits
the
taste
is
much
better
though
with
very
tart
fruit
being
the
primary
flavor
its
also
slightly
sour
with
a
bit
of
graininess
on
the
finish
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
wellcarbonated
and
goes
down
easily
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
a
delicious
and
very
unique
brew
its
really
not
quite
a
berliner
weiss
but
still
worth
consuming
enmasse
overall
i
was
sadly
disappointed
with
this
beer
but
its
nevertheless
still
dogfish
head
quality
brewing
its
more
on
the
sweetened
side
than
the
fruity
side
and
im
always
a
larger
fan
of
the
latter
very
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
otherwise
makes
me
long
to
try
berliner
weissbiers
over
in
germany
someday
i
thought
this
was
pretty
interesting
it
is
very
true
to
the
style
but
im
not
sure
this
is
for
me
d
its
a
poundable
session
beer
at
a
notverysessionable
price
i
could
only
imagine
the
peach
is
more
pungent
as
it
is
super
fresh
simple
beer
not
bad
at
all
o
this
is
an
extremely
unique
summer
seasonal
it
is
rather
mouth
puckering
and
i
feel
it
could
benefit
from
being
a
little
less
tart
and
having
more
peach
flavors
there
is
a
decent
complexity
though
the
drinkability
is
unfortunately
low
for
me
on
this
one
o
this
isnt
terrible
but
it
comes
off
very
messy
too
many
aspects
of
this
beer
collide
to
negate
flavors
and
sensations
some
nice
light
juicy
flavors
but
they
feel
contaminated
by
the
pickled
flavors
furthermore
the
mouth
plays
cleanup
by
drying
up
the
flavors
quickly
and
entirely
the
body
of
a
crisp
brew
without
the
crisp
clean
flavors
good
concept
beer
but
the
concentrated
flavors
tax
this
too
heavily
served
ontap
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
pale
yellow
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
slight
ring
of
film
around
the
glass
very
light
aromas
of
toasted
oats
and
the
slightest
hint
of
peach
sweetness
flavors
are
light
and
the
carbonation
keeps
it
very
crisp
semisour
flavor
with
very
mild
fruit
highlights
the
aftertaste
is
tangy
and
sour
and
the
finish
is
a
little
slick
and
a
little
sharp
very
interesting
brew
and
the
fruit
doesnt
overpower
like
other
fruit
beers
tend
to
do
very
light
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
the
sour
beers
and
this
one
follows
suit
im
sorry
dogfish
head
its
just
not
very
good
this
is
a
decent
berliner
weiss
with
the
focus
on
the
acidity
as
it
should
be
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
fruit
presence
overall
though
its
a
touch
watery
and
lacking
in
complexity
thirst
quencher
for
sure
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
drinkability
this
is
a
tart
malty
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
mouthfeel
is
light
clean
and
crisp
with
mild
carbonation
ive
had
this
couple
of
times
this
summer
and
it
seems
to
taste
better
the
hotter
the
weather
well
its
better
than
my
initial
impression
now
that
ive
had
a
year
more
experience
and
a
broader
horizon
for
appreciating
sours
and
fruit
beers
for
the
price
point
quite
a
decent
lambic
does
it
qualify
as
such
but
the
carbonation
and
bad
smell
are
kind
of
a
turnoff
this
is
a
very
gentle
sour
not
very
acidic
or
harsh
at
all
makes
a
good
introduction
for
a
friend
into
the
world
of
sours
later
on
they
can
ramp
up
the
pucker
and
acidity
if
they
feel
up
for
it
o
this
is
my
first
berliner
weissbier
review
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
too
but
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
its
basically
a
lighter
more
drinkable
version
of
a
peach
lambic
i
might
have
to
buy
some
more
before
this
is
gone
overall
this
beer
is
definetly
not
for
everyone
it
has
a
nice
sour
taste
but
its
not
a
typical
sour
its
as
if
they
used
green
peaches
to
brew
this
the
flavor
feels
really
artificial
im
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
again
its
definetly
different
than
all
the
other
summer
ales
i
have
tried
before
but
not
in
a
good
way
overall
almost
like
a
dry
peach
champagne
aroma
is
great
and
i
didnt
find
any
offnotes
in
the
flavor
something
seemed
to
be
missing
in
this
one
though
the
flavor
profile
was
a
tad
bit
onedimensional
while
the
co2
was
probably
a
bit
over
the
top
definitely
a
good
tasty
beer
though
so
please
give
it
a
try
to
see
what
you
think
t
very
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
peach
flavor
a
slight
wheat
taste
on
the
finish
to
me
it
didnt
taste
like
a
berliner
weiss
as
much
as
it
did
a
lambic
or
even
a
cider
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
quite
as
light
as
ive
come
to
expect
and
the
beer
lacked
that
delicate
tartness
that
said
i
still
enjoyed
it
a
lot
o
well
its
no
monks
flemish
sour
ale
yes
i
know
its
a
different
style
where
the
tartness
is
followed
by
a
bit
more
complexity
but
this
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
its
extremely
outside
the
box
i
will
probably
be
purchasing
my
own
pack
of
this
since
this
was
only
a
12oz
sample
as
far
as
summer
beers
go
this
was
definitely
refreshing
literally
and
figuratively
overall
this
is
very
nice
id
have
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
if
needed
2
50
a
single
is
ok
considering
the
nice
flavors
and
high
drinkability
o
a
really
great
of
the
style
it
actually
grows
on
me
a
lot
light
and
fun
unlike
some
other
berliner
weissbiers
the
tartness
is
never
overbearing
recommended
would
drink
again
o
definitely
not
my
thing
but
like
i
said
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
had
a
hard
time
rating
because
this
is
not
a
style
i
enjoy
i
wont
have
another
but
if
you
like
berliner
weissbiers
might
as
well
go
for
it
pours
a
nice
yellow
with
a
large
white
fluffy
lasting
head
aroma
of

not

with

on

overall
an
interesting
and
well
done
easy
drinking
brew
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
the
first
sour
i
have
ever
had
and
thought
it
was
a
good
summer
session
beer
very
light
and
easy
drinking
o
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
makes
you
scratch
your
head
not
pleased
with
the
smell
okay
appearance
but
with
a
unique
interesting
sour
lemonmango
taste
it
is
sure
to
please
aftertaste
is
all
sour
and
slightly
fruity
this
is
where
the
fruit
comes
out
to
play
if
you
can
make
it
through
the
initial
assault
youll
experience
what
this
beer
is
really
all
about
one
of
the
first
dfh
beers
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
it
tasted
like
someone
poured
canned
peach
juice
into
an
effervescent
wit
bier
ive
had
previous
iterations
of
this
beer
and
this
seasons
was
just
off
tasted
more
like
a
wine
cooler
than
it
did
a
beer
surprisingly
two
cases
of
this
flew
out
of
the
fridge
at
my
bbq
yesterday
im
thinking
everyone
else
enjoyed
it
far
more
o
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
the
body
and
the
sourness
of
it
balance
nicely
as
they
battle
back
and
forth
in
your
mouth
dogfish
head
has
done
it
again
pours
a
orange
amber
with
carbonation
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
and
very
little
head
you
can
immediately
detect
the
peach
concentrate
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
tart
in
the
finish
the
sweetness
from
the
peach
compliments
the
tartness
of
this
beer
nicely
crisp
and
well
carbonated
i
find
this
to
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
summer
brews
but
the
tartness
keeps
me
from
having
too
many
before
now
i
think
i
placed
absolute
trust
in
anything
that
was
made
by
dogfish
head
thus
i
picked
it
up
on
blind
faith
alone
going
to
try
really
hard
to
forget
this
beer
final
thought
fun
to
try
a
bottle
but
4
only
of
my
kids
wanted
peach
juice
but
still
lots
of
flavor
and
fun
to
drink
need
to
try
this
guy
on
tap
let
me
state
right
off
the
bat
that
i
did
not
like
this
beer
and
that
it
may
have
been
the
first
berliner
weissbier
ive
ever
had
after
reading
the
description
of
the
style
on
this
site
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
find
that
it
almost
perfectly
described
this
particular
beer
i
have
to
give
it
reasonably
high
marks
because
based
on
the
description
it
seemed
like
a
very
good
representative
of
this
style
i
may
revise
this
review
once
ive
had
a
chance
to
try
a
few
others
but
the
taste
was
awful
totally
sour
very
off
putting
i
think
i
like
this
beer
more
every
time
i
try
it
different
beer
from
dogfish
head
definitely
worth
a
try
it
was
a
good
summer
beer
if
not
at
least
refreshing
but
i
cant
let
the
peach
thing
go
oill
have
to
revisit
this
beer
after
i
introduce
my
palate
to
a
few
more
sour
beers
overall
the
beer
was
what
they
promised
but
im
still
not
convinced
they
should
put
peach
in
the
name
theres
a
bottle
of
lindemans
peche
lambic
in
the
fridge
and
im
looking
forward
to
it
i
havent
got
my
peach
fix
from
the
festina
beer
pours
a
very
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
vigorous
head
that
disappears
quickly
yeasty
wheat
laced
aroma
in
the
front
followed
by
ripe
peach
flavor
starts
with
the
maltiness
of
the
wheat
followed
by
a
pervasive
peach
nectar
flavor
very
tart
but
very
refreshing
the
tartness
is
not
overpowering
in
any
way
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
is
nice
to
get
a
summer
seasonal
that
is
a
little
different
your
dont
see
a
ton
of
berliner
weissbiers
around
and
thats
too
bad
this
beer
is
really
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
o
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonals
dogfish
rarely
fails
to
please
o
a
decent
fruit
beer
but
not
too
much
else
speaks
for
it
not
a
real
big
step
up
from
magic
hat
9
and
thats
not
saying
much
not
bad
i
like
this
a
little
more
than
i
think
i
did
last
year
though
maybe
less
than
2
years
ago
but
memories
can
be
hazy
not
the
most
impressive
looking
beer
in
the
world
bubbly
yellow
not
much
head
even
less
retention
smells
like
concentrated
peach
and
not
much
else
but
hints
of
wheat
but
damn
that
tartness
just
makes
this
beer
surprising
and
super
enjoyable
too
much
wheat
in
a
beer
can
sometimes
hinder
drinkability
for
me
and
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
maintaining
a
wheat
flavor
but
not
letting
it
take
over
the
tart
fruit
is
the
star
of
the
show
here
refreshing
crisp
and
enjoyable
a
great
summer
brew
thanks
dfh
overall
a
delicious
berliner
weiss
bier
from
dogfish
head
it
packs
a
lot
of
taste
into
a
dangerously
drinkable
4
5
beer
i
dont
know
much
better
with
style
like
this
but
this
seems
to
be
status
quo
from
what
i
gather
d
3
i
had
much
higher
hopes
for
this
brew
as
id
previously
enjoyed
aprihop
and
some
other
dfh
seasonals
i
suppose
i
wouldnt
have
found
out
without
trying
it
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
it
may
be
more
appealing
to
those
that
like
wine
or
other
fruit
beers
and
could
be
nice
and
refreshing
for
others
but
it
wasnt
my
cup
of
brew
overall
i
am
not
sure
i
am
a
big
fan
i
can
see
where
this
might
have
a
niche
market
but
for
the
money
refreshment
factor
and
overall
satisfaction
ill
be
sticking
with
bud
light
limes
this
summer
its
an
interesting
beer
i
like
sour
beers
and
food
in
general
but
prefer
to
have
it
balanced
out
with
some
sweetness
id
probably
really
like
this
beer
if
i
could
add
some
peach
syrup
or
one
of
the
traditional
berliner
weisse
syrups
to
it
as
it
is
its
a
bit
rough
although
maybe
i
could
get
used
to
it
the
price
was
reasonable
though
for
a
sour
beer
tartness
dominates
the
mouthfeel
but
leaves
a
tingle
dryness
bouncing
with
flavor
bread
and
peach
culls
a
desire
for
more
a
sharp
tart
bite
hits
up
front
giving
way
to
some
chewy
bread
notes
and
finishes
with
tart
peach
fully
covering
the
whole
mouth
there
is
some
sweet
bread
lingering
aftertaste
which
is
quite
nice
and
subtle
thanks
to
will
futura123
for
this
extra
active
carbonation
meets
a
rather
thin
body
for
a
wheat
ale
given
the
low
abv
the
body
size
works
overall
this
is
a
good
session
fruit
beer
its
tart
enough
to
satisfy
a
sour
craving
for
me
and
its
4
5
abv
makes
this
a
great
summer
drinking
candidate
if
this
were
available
in
my
distribution
area
then
id
be
buying
it
by
the
case
do
appearance
was
a
big
turnoff
from
the
start
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
would
like
to
try
a
newer
batch
sometime
o
a
pretty
decent
brew
very
refreshing
overall
solid
beer
overall
nothing
spectacular
here
but
nothing
offensive
in
any
way
either
i
would
recommend
giving
this
one
a
shot
dogfish
head
rarely
disappoints
very
carbonated
although
not
too
much
head
very
effervescent
while
sipping
o
if
sour
is
an
iffy
subject
this
is
probably
not
for
you
of
my
friends
with
me
3
of
the
4
said
they
couldnt
drink
a
whole
glass
because
of
the
sour
terrific
flavor
and
4
5
abv
is
perfect
for
a
session
i
havent
loved
all
the
other
dogfish
ive
tried
but
this
is
a
total
winner
in
my
book
m
light
bodied
nicely
carbonated
to
help
clean
the
palate
not
much
of
a
lasting
impression
with
this
brew
but
at
an
abv
of
4
5
it
is
very
sessionlike
o
overall
a
decent
and
refreshing
beer
at
10
a
4pack
its
a
bit
pricy
for
a
low
gravity
sessionable
beer
still
lots
of
tart
fruit
flavors
make
it
welcome
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
good
summer
brew
the
peach
flavor
is
good
but
not
over
the
top
summer
wheat
flavor
with
the
peach
flavor
coming
in
second
but
getting
stronger
with
more
tastes
overall
i
think
it
is
a
quality
summer
beer
but
lacks
some
depth
and
complexity
the
peach
again
doesnt
taste
authentic
sour
is
distracting
from
otherwise
quality
beer
taste
is
tart
and
sweet
with
a
very
nice
refreshing
bite
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
tasty
delightful
summer
beer
o
dogfish
head
is
usually
hit
or
miss
from
me
i
enjoy
a
lot
of
their
stuff
but
wouldnt
have
this
again
o
not
a
bad
summer
beer
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
again
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
conclusion
ive
had
three
different
ages
with
this
beer
fresh
last
years
batch
over
the
spring
and
a
four
year
old
bottle
i
actually
really
liked
it
with
almost
a
year
on
it
it
became
even
tarter
and
more
sour
fresh
is
pretty
nice
too
but
four
years
is
just
overkill
for
this
beer
overall
a
decent
summer
offering
from
dfh
thats
something
different
i
love
the
tartness
of
this
beer
and
the
fruit
flavor
it
is
not
too
overpowering
or
too
sour
that
it
isnt
enjoyable
dogfish
can
pull
this
beer
off
but
i
am
sure
it
is
not
everyones
favorite
pours
a
soft
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
has
characteristics
of
apple
juice
as
well
as
fresh
tart
apples
but
it
veers
off
beyond
being
just
tart
to
the
point
of
being
a
bit
musty
and
sour
the
flavor
is
more
appealing
with
the
tart
apple
character
being
complemented
by
some
light
wheat
and
the
peaches
add
a
nice
light
sweet
fruitiness
the
light
and
active
carbonation
further
complements
this
light
sweettart
flavor
overall
the
earthy
wheat
applelike
acidity
and
sweet
peaches
combine
to
make
this
beer
an
interesting
and
refreshing
changeofpace
first
time
i
can
say
i
did
not
fall
in
love
with
a
beer
from
dfh
to
me
this
is
way
way
too
sweet
maybe
because
they
used
a
peach
extract
ive
never
had
this
before
but
other
told
me
it
is
much
sweeter
than
normal
would
love
to
try
an
older
one
to
see
if
this
is
the
case
has
a
nice
yellowishcopper
color
with
a
nice
peachy
smell
to
it
that
didnt
completely
throw
me
off
when
i
dove
my
nose
into
my
dogfish
snifter
to
smell
all
the
fruit
just
cant
see
anybody
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
i
could
see
splitting
a
bottle
with
someone
while
having
a
dessert
in
place
of
a
port
have
2
bottles
left
at
the
house
think
that
is
what
i
will
use
them
for
overall
the
beer
seems
to
fit
the
description
of
a
berliner
weissbier
quite
well
based
both
on
appearance
and
taste
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
wouldnt
want
more
that
one
of
in
a
sitting
im
happy
i
gave
it
a
shot
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
o
not
terrible
but
not
their
best
work
3
5
a
interesting
beer
worth
watching
how
it
develops
over
the
years
o
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
summer
offering
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
develops
over
months
and
over
the
years
all
around
a
very
nice
berliner
weiss
i
have
talked
to
many
people
on
this
style
from
germany
and
they
all
tell
me
that
berliner
weiss
should
be
mixed
with
a
splash
of
raspberry
syrup
but
the
addition
of
the
peach
in
this
brew
comes
close
to
the
authentic
representation
of
the
classic
style
overall
this
is
a
nice
light
fruity
change
from
many
of
the
beers
i
am
used
to
definitely
worth
a
try
though
i
do
not
have
the
experience
of
having
had
this
beer
in
the
past
so
this
is
the
first
batch
i
have
tried
overall
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
it
fits
well
with
summer
time
foods
and
activities
i
think
it
may
be
a
beer
you
love
or
will
just
try
and
may
not
try
again
overall
a
cross
between
a
sahti
and
a
wheat
beer
price
10
99
for
a
sixpack
at
whole
foods
m
very
light
flavor
transition
has
a
snap
to
it
and
it
is
almost
watery
in
places
drink
it
if
you
must
but
expect
something
unlike
youve
ever
tasted
and
not
necessarily
in
the
good
way
depending
on
your
taste
overall
this
is
a
change
very
intersting
brew
as
this
is
one
of
the
two
bws
ive
tried
i
found
it
refreshing
and
interesting
however
i
wouldnt
really
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
light
mouthfeel
that
is
plesant
to
drink
especially
if
you
like
any
sour
brews
which
i
do
great
summer
offering
and
the
light
abv
almost
makes
this
an
excellent
replacement
for
lemonade
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
for
those
that
like
peach
flavor
in
their
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
slightly
sweet
at
first
yet
not
like
peach
syrup
as
it
begins
to
have
a
lactic
sour
edge
and
hold
until
the
carbonation
starts
to
seem
like
a
spice
combined
with
the
wheat
flavor
which
has
a
slight
toastiness
and
is
gently
grainy
i
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
it
is
refreshing
yet
full
of
flavor
with
so
much
happening
in
such
a
relatively
low
alcohol
wheat
i
recommend
this
to
those
who
enjoy
peaches
and
wheat
and
sour
candy
o
damn
good
beer
for
summer
or
hot
weather
perfect
balance
of
sourness
and
fruit
for
the
style
and
although
outside
of
abv
range
for
b
w
it
is
something
i
would
definitely
drink
again
this
would
be
good
for
someone
starting
in
on
sour
beers
also
o
great
and
easy
summer
drinker
that
goes
down
nice
and
easily
but
has
that
sourness
that
keeps
you
on
your
toes
a
nice
mixup
from
the
usual
summer
beer
o
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
refreshing
and
great
for
a
summer
day
a
definate
goto
summer
beer
for
me
o
d
a
good
easy
drinking
summer
beer
a
bit
pricey
if
i
recall
correctly
but
this
is
a
nice
and
interesting
and
refreshing
drink
notes
refreshing
its
the
name
of
the
game
for
this
beer
and
it
fufills
it
to
the
max
a
phenomenal
summer
seasonal
and
ill
probably
end
up
buying
a
case
of
this
next
year
as
well
worth
trying
nice
light
feel
with
crisp
carbonation
this
one
overall
isnt
bad
i
actually
remember
liking
it
a
lot
more
before
they
changed
the
recipe
a
bit
to
tone
down
the
sourness
of
it
i
liked
it
better
two
years
ago
but
its
still
solid
a
few
off
aromas
and
off
flavors
but
even
with
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
some
what
enjoyable
maybe
just
not
my
style
2011
batch
seems
to
have
more
acidity
than
the
2010
batch
but
not
as
much
as
the
2009
batch
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
peach
juice
didnt
overpower
the
beer
for
me
and
the
lactic
acid
they
add
in
the
brew
kettle
was
very
balanced
overall
making
it
a
real
easy
drinker
the
price
seems
steep
for
a
simple
4
5
abv
beer
but
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
just
sour
enough
to
not
make
you
think
youre
drinking
a
lindemans
peche
good
stuff
and
very
drinkable
and
fairly
light
a
nice
take
on
a
berliner
wiesse
but
with
more
bready
malts
and
sweetness
than
i
would
like
gets
heavy
in
some
areas
tartness
and
crisp
feel
were
excellent
however
definitely
worth
a
try
and
one
of
the
more
unique
seasonals
out
there
the
color
when
poured
was
a
hazy
wheat
yellow
with
very
little
foam
and
some
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
acidic
citrus
was
the
only
aroma
that
was
evident
the
taste
had
a
the
components
of
a
bittersouracidicsemisweetsalty
citrus
flavor
but
i
couldnt
taste
the
peach
in
fact
i
couldnt
taste
anyone
type
of
citurs
not
one
of
their
better
brews
thanks
steve
o
this
has
good
drinkability
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
it
is
a
nice
new
twist
on
what
most
breweries
put
out
as
a
summer
beer
it
is
light
refreshing
and
they
didnt
go
overboard
with
the
fruit
also
with
it
only
being
4
5
abv
i
could
drink
these
all
day
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
d
a
great
summer
brew
very
refreshing
outdoors
as
well
as
indoors
in
my
case
buy
it
by
the
case
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
am
kind
of
kicking
my
self
for
just
getting
into
it
now
i
had
this
on
draft
a
year
ago
and
didnt
think
much
of
it
either
that
was
a
bad
pour
or
my
palette
has
really
changed
m
nice
bit
of
pucking
tartness
with
a
unexpected
semidry
finish
not
full
bodied
of
course
but
not
thin
not
knowing
anything
about
this
beer
the
sourness
surprised
me
it
appealed
to
my
love
of
sours
showing
me
a
style
i
did
not
know
existed
oi
had
this
last
year
and
was
blown
away
but
never
reviewed
it
coming
back
to
it
a
year
later
with
a
much
more
expanded
palate
sure
changes
things
it
still
tastes
interesting
worth
a
try
but
not
as
good
as
memory
led
me
to
believe
sour
is
the
first
taste
that
comes
to
mind
its
very
tart
like
a
sweettart
candy
in
the
front
and
then
syrupy
on
the
back
like
a
cola
the
taste
profile
is
all
about
the
sourness
of
the
peach
and
lemon
flavors
the
finish
is
ultradry
like
champagne
but
it
has
the
added
sour
bite
in
the
aftertaste
that
makes
it
different
its
not
at
all
like
a
traditional
beer
but
its
also
not
like
any
beer
ive
ever
had
before
and
im
always
down
to
try
new
styles
and
beers
especially
those
by
dogfish
im
enjoying
this
more
than
i
expected
i
would
and
im
glad
i
bought
it
nice
summery
beer
with
the
dry
finish
that
makes
you
crave
more
o
this
beers
not
bad
but
its
in
a
style
that
in
my
opinion
should
focus
more
and
subtlety
and
balance
neither
of
which
this
possess
still
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
reach
for
it
even
though
its
barely
average
for
its
style
well
done
dfh
a
summer
beer
that
is
super
drinkable
with
an
abv
that
wont
make
you
fall
over
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
beer
i
will
stock
for
the
summer
to
enjoy
on
those
hot
days
and
not
so
hot
days
o
a
nice
thirst
quencher
and
a
change
from
the
typical
cant
see
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
day
though
mouthfeel
seems
fine
maybe
a
little
slicker
than
other
berliners
not
as
dry
but
good
by
my
standard
drinks
extremely
easily
but
i
dont
know
if
id
have
more
than
one
just
cause
of
its
fruitiness
no
ones
drinks
cup
after
cup
of
oj
or
at
least
i
dont
definitely
an
interesting
idea
by
dfh
but
id
prolly
only
buy
2
four
packs
for
the
entire
summer
tops
o
a
nice
affordable
and
interesting
twist
on
the
berliner
weissbier
style
definitely
very
peach
forward
a
great
summer
beer
this
has
amazing
drinkablilty
overall
a
nice
summer
beer
perhaps
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
not
bad
overall
i
cracked
this
open
at
1230
pm
after
a
soccer
game
on
a
95
degree
day
and
man
it
hit
the
spot
i
dont
really
care
how
much
flavor
is
hasdoesnt
have
it
is
quenching
and
refreshing
i
plan
on
drinking
a
more
authentic
berliner
weisse
tomorrow
and
will
maybe
change
my
opinion
of
this
beer
o
another
interesting
beer
from
dogfish
head
i
love
how
they
use
different
ingredients
in
their
beer
this
beer
quenches
my
thirst
i
great
seasonal
beer
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
one
the
peach
flavor
comes
through
like
peach
from
concentrate
the
color
is
rather
strange
an
odd
bright
orangeyellow
and
the
bitterness
overwhelms
the
taste
of
the
beer
perhaps
the
only
thing
i
really
liked
was
the
finish
since
the
flavor
finally
blended
into
a
tolerable
taste
the
labeling
was
really
well
done
as
well
p
this
is
a
light
refreshing
beverage
thats
good
for
the
summer
and
its
probably
the
only
beer
with
peaches
ive
ever
had
im
not
really
sure
what
to
compare
it
to
its
got
a
bit
more
flavor
but
a
lot
less
sour
than
a
regular
berliner
weisse
o
dfh
cant
do
anything
simply
and
i
applaud
them
for
it
this
is
a
really
nice
summer
beer
but
not
one
ill
want
to
get
more
than
one
more
four
pack
of
overall
this
is
an
odd
beer
for
me
its
my
third
year
picking
up
a
4
pack
or
2
in
the
summer
expecting
it
to
knock
my
socks
off
it
doesnt
but
its
still
a
good
albeit
unusual
beer
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
great
sourness
but
not
overpowering
and
great
peach
flavor
super
sessionable
and
great
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
oh
and
this
years
version
seems
almost
identical
to
last
years
another
great
job
by
dfh
really
tasty
and
very
drinkable
on
a
mind
numbingly
hot
day
like
today
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
orange
with
thin
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
sea
foam
lace
it
looks
the
part
for
its
style
the
smell
is
dominated
by
peach
a
tart
lemony
citrus
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
and
metallic
notes
the
taste
will
wake
the
taste
buds
up
with
a
tart
peach
lemon
citrus
domination
bready
and
grainy
malts
in
the
back
slight
peachy
sweetness
like
a
remnant
that
didnt
ferment
out
a
nicely
balanced
tart
sour
but
refreshing
crisp
clean
beer
very
different
as
to
be
expected
from
dogfish
head
o
if
you
dont
enjoy
tart
things
simply
dont
try
this
beer
i
bought
this
because
my
wife
wanted
to
try
it
but
i
wound
up
drinking
it
on
this
100
degree
day
while
she
was
napping
it
was
refreshing
and
good
but
i
dont
see
how
i
could
ever
crave
it
looks
like
a
oneshot
deal
i
dont
see
how
i
can
recommend
this
on
hot
days
with
weihenstephaner
being
such
an
easy
find
but
if
you
want
to
try
i
wont
stop
you
o
very
much
a
oneanddone
type
refresher
for
me
but
man
this
beats
lemonade
on
a
scorching
hot
day
any
time
the
4
5
abv
means
you
could
drink
it
all
day
but
festina
peche
likens
itself
to
a
quenching
sipper
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
tart
sour
flavors
you
might
right
this
brew
too
poorly
pop
a
pepcid
and
relax
in
the
sun
with
this
interesting
neoberliner
weiss
never
had
festina
peche
nor
a
berliner
weisse
before
so
this
was
a
new
experience
for
me
only
just
begun
dipping
my
toes
into
sour
styles
and
i
found
this
one
to
be
rather
tart
and
puckering
overall
i
have
not
had
this
style
before
or
a
traditional
berliner
weiss
say
from
the
old
original
country
i
would
love
to
try
one
for
comparison
but
this
i
think
is
just
one
of
those
things
in
craft
where
sam
and
company
have
struck
gold
and
hell
yeah
its
nothing
like
it
out
of
the
bottle
its
fantastic
on
tap
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
rapidly
disappearing
head
slightly
cloudy
the
beer
has
a
very
sour
aroma
sort
of
like
lemon
meringue
pie
but
breadier
and
not
as
lemony
if
there
is
any
peach
profile
to
this
beer
it
is
in
the
aroma
even
then
one
must
use
imagination
to
detect
it
taste
is
very
tart
i
can
only
imagine
what
this
beer
might
have
tasted
like
without
the
peach
extract
the
sour
finish
lingers
and
finishes
clean
medium
high
carbonation
with
some
bite
on
the
tongue
body
is
light
texture
is
acidic
this
beer
is
interesting
because
it
is
the
first
of
this
style
for
me
i
will
drink
another
but
early
in
the
evening
with
a
light
crisp
salad
perhaps
the
taste
is
great
yogurty
and
slightly
sour
fantastic
control
on
that
a
light
nondistinguished
fruit
tartness
lays
in
the
back
i
know
its
supposed
to
be
peach
but
i
dont
think
its
that
distinct
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
could
down
this
for
a
long
time
on
a
hot
day
gotta
love
those
sours
o
would
be
great
if
it
was
significantly
more
sour
but
is
is
this
is
still
a
good
beer
a
bit
low
on
the
wheat
for
a
berliner
weiss
the
peach
presence
is
nice
but
would
be
much
better
if
there
was
much
more
lacto
pours
a
light
golden
orange
with
the
smallest
hint
of
haze
very
lively
head
pours
tall
but
leaves
shortly
thereafter
with
no
lacing
nose
is
milky
sour
withsimple
notes
of
apricot
and
peach
taste
is
almost
creamy
with
lacto
sourness
and
really
just
straight
peach
very
refreshing
with
lively
carbonation
and
nice
puckering
acidity
i
had
a
2010
about
a
month
ago
and
found
it
to
be
more
complex
and
sour
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
with
more
age
i
realize
berliners
arent
ment
to
be
aged
but
it
seemed
to
work
into
my
dfh
pint
glass
on
6
6
11
this
pours
a
clear
and
faded
dirty
yellow
gold
color
under
a
thin
film
head
certainly
looks
crisp
and
refreshing
spritzy
and
tart
lemon
citrus
aroma
over
a
crisp
wheat
malt
backdrop
immediately
fills
the
nose
a
sharp
sweet
and
sour
lemon
note
hits
the
tip
of
the
tongue
at
first
and
refreshingly
glides
over
the
palate
with
a
solid
tart
feel
into
a
somewhat
dry
and
sticky
lemon
zesty
citrus
finish
ending
notes
of
moderately
sour
peach
and
lemon
juice
seem
held
back
enough
by
malt
character
to
makes
this
taste
more
like
a
sweetart
than
a
war
head
the
flavor
on
this
is
wonderful
at
first
i
got
a
light
peach
taste
and
then
sour
when
i
swishes
it
around
the
aftertaste
is
a
light
tart
taste
i
enjoyed
this
in
a
glass
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
really
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
and
im
eager
to
pick
up
more
not
too
boozy
so
its
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
at
a
bbq
i
lost
track
of
how
many
of
these
i
actually
consumed
considering
that
whenever
i
went
back
to
the
bar
to
get
another
the
full
glass
i
had
on
my
table
was
mysteriously
halffull
by
the
time
i
got
back
oh
well
i
guess
my
friends
liked
it
too
overall
i
would
say
that
the
beer
is
good
i
wouldnt
run
out
and
stock
up
on
this
one
but
im
glad
that
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
sours
overal
i
wish
the
fruitiness
came
out
a
bit
more
as
it
seemed
a
little
muted
for
my
taste
but
overall
a
very
refreshing
drink
and
at
around
4
5
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
to
relax
with
overall
kudos
to
dogfish
head
for
putting
out
a
summer
beer
that
is
outside
the
box
tart
fresh
and
refreshing
nice
summer
brew
all
around
o
overall
an
extremely
pleasant
beer
for
the
good
weather
works
well
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
given
the
uncharacteristically
low
abv
4
5
for
a
dfh
brew
i
didnt
know
quite
what
to
expect
from
this
one
before
i
tried
it
i
didnt
know
whether
it
would
be
more
beer
or
cider
it
very
much
comes
across
like
a
cider
but
this
is
in
no
way
a
bad
thing
its
extremely
drinkable
its
got
a
big
taste
and
balances
the
tart
and
sweet
flavours
nicely
would
be
fantastic
for
those
hot
summer
days
i
like
it
a
lot
but
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
what
happens
when
you
leave
chicken
stock
in
a
walkin
cooler
for
too
long
you
get
this
sourness
in
the
nose
and
maybe
im
just
biased
and
influenced
by
my
past
experiences
with
sour
chicken
stock
but
this
reminds
me
too
much
of
it
to
be
as
enjoyable
as
it
could
that
being
said
i
think
its
incredibly
well
balanced
and
it
doesnt
tread
too
closely
to
being
a
juicysweet
fruit
beer
very
nice
little
number
o
again
i
should
have
grabbed
a
bottle
with
a
bottling
date
that
was
clearly
legiable
o
the
addition
of
peaches
helps
to
balance
off
the
sourness
associated
with
this
style
much
like
fruit
syrups
are
added
to
other
berliner
weissbiers
to
make
them
more
palatable
its
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
and
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
very
sessionable
if
you
can
handle
the
light
amount
of
sourness
o
not
a
big
fan
of
wildsour
ales
but
i
have
tried
a
few
including
this
on
numerous
occasions
which
i
feel
like
i
enjoyed
more
previously
still
enjoyed
this
beer
a
bit
and
tried
to
rate
in
comparison
with
the
style
and
not
my
personal
tastes
would
have
gotten
a
cb
for
my
taste
but
i
have
had
numerous
sour
and
wild
ales
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
overall
i
think
its
slightly
above
average
my
fiancee
says
that
she
begs
to
differ
and
claims
this
is
one
of
her
favorite
beers
agree
to
disagree
i
suppose
its
not
my
bag
but
i
can
definitely
respect
this
brew
anyway
thanks
to
hophead101
for
giving
me
a
bottle
of
2007
to
try
o
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
in
my
opinion
its
not
awful
but
its
a
little
bit
too
sour
doesnt
seem
to
have
a
good
balance
i
probably
wouldnt
revisit
this
beer
willingly
although
i
wouldnt
keep
someone
else
from
trying
it
im
sure
some
people
will
find
this
beer
rather
pleasant
o
pretty
good
i
dont
think
i
will
mind
drinking
the
rest
of
this
4
pack
it
comes
as
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
considering
the
usual
quality
of
dogfish
head
but
i
guess
no
one
is
always
perfect
mfo
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
prickle
from
the
carbonation
tart
finish
and
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
probably
the
only
dogfish
head
brew
ive
had
so
far
that
i
did
not
care
for
it
is
a
weissbier
brewed
with
peach
with
the
option
at
the
bar
to
add
mango
concentrate
which
i
opted
not
to
do
i
dont
know
if
the
tap
was
bad
or
what
but
this
beer
was
sodafizzy
and
tasted
watered
down
poured
hazy
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
bitter
hop
aroma
and
kind
of
funky
thin
watery
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
stale
wood
light
and
fairly
easily
drinkable
but
not
too
much
flavor
or
character
which
is
not
what
i
expect
from
dogfish
head
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
brew
i
usually
really
enjoy
dogfish
however
this
one
was
not
for
me
too
sweet
and
too
sour
one
of
these
would
be
all
i
could
have
probably
wont
visit
this
again
anytime
soon
im
sure
some
like
it
so
they
can
have
my
share
as
it
warmed
it
became
more
tolerable
overall
wasnt
expecting
that
strong
sourness
but
it
was
a
cool
surprise
would
love
to
try
another
on
a
hot
day
while
camping
bottled
review
like
most
beer
nuts
i
love
this
brewery
and
i
consider
myself
quite
lucky
that
at
anytime
i
could
take
a
3
hour
road
trip
to
dfh
and
have
a
lot
of
wonderful
brews
but
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
enjoy
this
brew
specifically
when
i
received
a
4
pack
from
my
family
as
a
gift
i
was
really
excited
to
try
it
because
it
was
new
at
the
time
i
poured
my
first
one
into
a
glass
and
everything
looked
good
it
smelled
a
little
funky
but
that
didnt
bother
me
it
was
the
taste
it
was
really
not
my
cup
of
tea
to
this
day
i
cant
figure
out
why
i
think
this
beer
tastes
like
vomit
to
me
i
feel
really
bad
that
i
cant
enjoy
this
brew
like
a
lot
of
other
people
do
but
this
is
one
that
i
cant
get
passed
my
lips
anymore
smells
like
peach
candy
and
citrus
tastes
like
lemon
pulp
and
grass
with
a
little
bitter
peach
i
was
expecting
something
like
a
peach
lambic
but
this
is
so
much
more
not
the
sort
of
thing
id
get
for
leisurely
drinkingits
too
fancy
and
sweet
for
that
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
with
dessert
or
as
an
aperitif
the
cpj
d
low
alcohol
content
really
makes
the
citruspeach
favors
stand
out
i
thought
it
was
a
good
fruit
flavored
beer
unique
good
summer
drink
pours
a
pretty
clear
super
fizzy
golden
color
with
a
very
small
fizzy
head
with
absolutely
no
lacing
smells
of
peach
and
a
little
tartness
and
some
malts
tastes
a
little
of
peaches
and
a
little
watered
down
amber
ale
mixed
together
almost
like
a
lindemans
peche
with
very
little
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
huge
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
low
abv
and
pleasant
tastemouthfeel
lead
to
very
good
drinkability
i
liked
this
more
than
i
expected
but
still
wouldnt
want
very
often
an
interesting
concept
to
blend
peaches
with
this
style
good
but
i
like
the
traditional
better
still
a
must
try
for
its
uniqueness
this
is
the
2010
brew
if
youre
interested
so
looking
at
the
below
review
i
will
be
aging
my
other
bottles
for
a
few
years
thanks
to
stan
for
sharing
this
treat
poured
from
a
2004
750
ml
bottle
there
was
still
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
it
showed
with
a
nice
finger
worth
of
tiny
white
bubbles
that
sat
at
the
top
of
the
snifter
for
a
while
the
color
reminded
me
of
a
peach
or
apricot
the
aromas
of
peach
juice
and
funk
were
still
very
prevalent
in
the
nose
i
have
had
this
fresh
but
this
aged
bottle
was
fantastic
in
the
flavor
department
it
was
tart
with
a
hint
of
peach
sweetness
coming
thru
to
make
this
thing
superbly
drinkable
we
sipped
at
this
bottle
for
a
good
hour
and
enjoyed
every
drop
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
great
carbonation
for
your
tongue
i
would
not
have
thought
to
age
this
one
that
long
but
i
will
be
doing
a
few
bottles
for
myself
it
really
just
mellowed
down
the
sourness
and
made
this
a
great
brew
on
tap
at
dfh
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
white
head
aroma
is
sour
citrus
that
overpowers
what
little
sweet
malt
is
there
flavor
is
sour
lemons
and
peach
concentrate
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
just
couldnt
get
into
this
one
pours
an
absolutely
uniquelooking
clear
light
whitishyellow
looks
like
a
champagne
nice
head
retention
smells
peachy
and
light
malty
with
the
taste
unripened
peaches
mixed
with
some
unripened
grapes
as
well
there
is
nothing
predominating
except
for
the
sourness
flat
feel
sour
finish
im
gonna
sample
this
one
from
the
bottle
because
it
just
didnt
do
it
at
all
for
me
on
tap
cheers
m
light
bodied
with
some
good
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
and
clean
beer
and
probably
a
real
treat
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
enjoyed
though
its
one
of
dogfishs
lighter
less
bold
brews
d
though
i
think
this
beer
is
definitely
not
a
berliner
weisse
as
it
is
missing
that
essential
ascorbic
flavor
it
is
super
tasty
and
tart
love
the
away
the
peaches
come
through
so
that
they
taste
complete
and
integrated
at
the
same
time
good
drink
will
have
again
when
i
see
it
ive
had
it
in
the
bottle
and
i
thought
it
was
flabby
and
dull
ontap
however
it
was
delicious
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
and
never
stopped
to
consider
drinking
anything
else
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
wine
cooler
not
a
beer
dfh
does
amazing
things
but
this
is
not
it
not
to
diss
anyone
who
enjoys
this
beer
but
if
there
was
ever
a
girly
beer
this
is
it
standard
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
had
little
to
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
sour
peaches
smelled
wonderful
it
tasted
sour
than
i
expected
but
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
it
it
was
super
easy
to
drink
and
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
crave
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
poured
a
very
light
yellow
almost
like
a
sparkling
white
grape
juice
that
is
a
little
hazy
there
is
tons
of
carbonation
i
dont
get
much
peach
in
the
scent
as
i
expected
but
that
may
not
be
a
bad
thing
necessarily
the
taste
had
a
good
peach
flavor
that
gave
it
a
sourness
it
isnt
a
sour
and
didnt
have
the
sourness
i
want
when
going
that
route
and
it
wasnt
malty
or
hoppy
the
flavor
seemed
a
bit
lost
if
you
ask
me
it
isnt
bad
i
am
just
disappointed
d
a
well
made
interesting
take
on
the
berliner
weissbier
drinkable
very
good
worth
trying
dm
strong
carbonation
tingle
sweetness
really
makes
it
a
joy
to
drink
and
isnt
in
any
way
a
turn
off
drinks
very
smooth
and
light
l
s
m
and
d
seem
to
be
exactly
per
style
the
peach
flavor
is
nice
though
i
dont
know
if
i
would
pick
peach
out
if
it
were
not
on
the
label
i
may
have
guessed
a
citrus
mix
this
is
a
carbonated
refreshing
beer
but
is
so
light
i
am
not
inclined
to
seek
it
out
again
the
syrupy
fruity
flavor
just
does
not
have
enough
texture
to
make
it
interesting
there
is
a
little
bit
of
grassy
flavor
at
the
finish
but
this
still
drinks
close
to
a
soda
than
i
prefer
with
a
beer
this
has
a
pretty
accessible
level
of
sour
to
it
thus
is
a
nice
introduction
to
sourer
beer
flavors
i
have
limited
experience
with
this
style
and
i
thank
dfh
for
expanding
my
beer
culture
with
it
but
it
will
be
low
on
my
list
going
forward
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
i
was
not
impressed
i
am
now
for
its
style
its
a
really
good
brew
this
is
okay
but
nothing
ill
ever
want
to
revisit
one
thing
ill
always
say
about
dogfish
head
is
that
their
penchant
for
experimentation
not
only
makes
them
one
of
the
most
interesting
brewers
in
the
business
but
that
sort
of
lets
trying
everything
and
anything
sometimes
produces
lessthanspectacular
results
cest
la
vie
theyre
still
one
of
the
best
breweries
ever
i
have
to
say
though
that
im
a
little
disappointed
that
dogfish
head
of
all
breweries
wouldnt
chose
to
develop
the
lactic
quality
and
peach
flavor
naturally
why
not
use
lactobacillus
instead
of
lactic
acid
why
not
whole
peaches
instead
of
peach
concentrate
dfh
has
the
resources
they
have
sourced
water
from
antarctica
for
crying
out
loud
sam
seems
to
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
his
ingredients
and
processes
so
why
the
lapse
with
this
beer
quite
nice
far
from
traditional
and
with
enough
complexity
and
flavor
in
some
sort
of
harmony
to
make
this
an
appealing
seasonal
beverage
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
finish
needs
some
work
and
more
flavour
ive
said
this
before
but
dfh
has
my
respect
for
their
experimental
nature
only
their
beers
themselves
just
never
really
manage
to
get
me
into
bed
d
if
it
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
maybe
it
would
have
faired
better
also
considering
that
i
am
drinking
this
beer
out
of
season
i
am
worried
that
i
have
picked
up
a
rather
old
bottle
not
a
beer
for
me
really
i
havent
had
a
really
pleasant
berliner
weisse
from
outside
germany
and
this
is
yet
another
subpar
example
the
peach
character
tries
its
hardest
to
give
something
to
the
beer
but
it
fails
in
my
opinion
not
a
great
beer
dogfish
head
again
try
something
different
and
i
love
them
for
trying
but
yet
again
they
fall
short
d
super
drinkable
i
really
like
the
peach
flavor
and
the
funkiness
and
tartness
really
enhances
it
a
lot
fantastic
beer
its
also
worth
noting
that
while
this
beer
is
understandably
sold
as
a
summer
seasonal
mine
worked
just
as
well
on
a
crisp
november
afternoon
i
paired
it
with
an
egg
and
bacon
sandwich
as
my
first
beer
of
the
day
this
would
be
perfect
if
youre
looking
for
a
champagne
substitute
at
brunch
d
its
drinkable
refreshing
and
beer
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
a
nice
change
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
superbly
pale
of
straw
color
with
simply
no
head
to
be
found
the
aroma
is
as
promised
there
is
a
nice
peach
syrup
aroma
that
has
a
slightly
sour
undertone
that
really
is
the
extent
of
the
aroma
still
good
though
the
taste
is
both
peachy
and
sour
this
neoberliner
style
weissbier
style
seems
to
be
fiercely
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
would
have
expected
its
still
not
horrible
mouthfeel
is
seemingly
overcarbonated
not
too
bad
its
drinkable
but
i
really
dont
like
it
too
much
its
an
decent
beer
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
d
what
a
refreshing
summer
sipper
this
would
be
fp
is
very
sessionable
at
4
5
but
i
think
the
sweetness
would
get
to
me
after
awhile
d
works
great
when
paired
with
a
thick
soup
would
probably
be
a
great
summer
beer
as
well
a
girlfriend
beer
yet
the
tartness
and
peach
are
complex
enough
for
any
enthusiast
of
craft
beer
sessionable
at
4
5
if
not
for
the
tartiness
that
would
limit
me
to
a
4
pack
but
for
its
intended
purpose
a
great
summer
poolside
beer
poured
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
had
tropical
fruit
juice
and
tart
esters
very
carbonated
which
attacked
the
palate
nicely
with
layers
and
textures
very
sweet
and
fruity
flavors
and
very
sour
towards
the
finish
with
a
finish
the
finish
tasted
of
yeast
tones
i
could
taste
the
peach
a
little
but
definitely
not
over
bearing
i
feel
in
the
bottled
versions
the
peach
is
more
evident
and
concentratedlike
however
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
d
this
is
like
a
lower
carbonated
izze
soda
kudos
to
dogfish
head
though
for
trying
styles
that
no
one
else
would
dare
come
near
drinkability
low
abv
and
easy
to
knock
a
couple
back
the
only
thing
that
might
keep
me
from
downing
a
case
is
the
tartness
not
sure
how
long
i
could
go
without
it
becoming
a
little
overbearing
d
light
and
refreshing
but
the
sourness
leaves
me
to
only
wanting
one
of
these
at
a
time
good
for
a
change
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
peach
flavoring
dreally
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
with
an
interesting
flavor
profile
crisp
clean
and
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
drinkable
and
refreshing
d
pretty
good
beer
some
of
its
characteristics
were
a
bit
disappointing
but
overall
a
decent
beer
a
little
on
the
high
side
pricewise
8
99
for
a
four
pack
is
a
bit
much
so
i
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
insanely
drinkable
id
drink
a
six
pack
by
the
pool
without
even
thinking
about
it
very
refreshing
and
tasty
maybe
the
perfect
summer
beer
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
summer
i
love
this
beer
it
is
my
summer
brew
d
it
was
more
of
a
novelty
one
time
thing
for
me
i
cant
imagine
drinking
this
again
overall
it
was
decent
i
dont
think
i
wouldve
spent
the
3
bucks
on
this
brew
going
in
if
i
knew
what
it
tasted
like
this
isnt
at
all
your
typical
dfh
brew
unlike
many
other
dfh
beers
this
one
is
very
very
light
there
is
very
little
foam
and
what
seems
to
be
a
high
level
of
carbonation
also
it
is
very
dry
and
fruity
due
to
the
addition
of
peaches
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
had
expected
but
i
should
have
known
better
because
sweet
fruit
always
produces
a
dry
ciderlike
characteristic
that
being
said
it
is
a
good
beer
and
a
great
change
of
pace
for
the
dfh
regular
but
its
just
not
my
cup
of
teaor
beer
in
this
case
poured
fairly
yellow
a
little
fizzy
but
not
too
much
head
smells
a
little
bit
like
peach
expected
but
overall
mostly
sweet
taste
is
moderately
sweet
maybe
a
little
tart
but
not
sour
the
beer
was
refreshing
and
left
a
reasonable
tastefeel
in
my
mouth
the
overall
drinkability
isnt
bad
however
there
are
plenty
of
things
i
would
choose
over
it
its
actually
not
bad
as
a
person
who
likes
sour
beverages
such
as
lemonade
i
cant
say
that
i
found
this
displeasing
at
all
the
tart
nature
was
definitely
there
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
puckering
the
soft
wheat
at
the
end
was
a
nice
finish
awesomely
sessionable
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
to
me
is
off
the
charts
super
refreshing
nice
balanced
flavor
and
with
a
nice
finish
on
it
like
said
before
best
summer
beer
ever
edit
the
2009
version
is
the
bomb
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
very
little
head
looks
like
ginger
ale
to
me
smell
is
grainmalt
and
a
lemon
zest
odor
taste
is
tart
and
sour
with
a
grain
and
malt
then
a
tart
fruit
overall
taste
its
crisp
and
carbonated
with
very
little
peach
taste
mouth
feel
is
thin
but
it
is
crisp
tartand
sour
this
is
made
as
a
berliner
should
be
as
far
as
characteristics
of
one
its
just
to
thin
tasting
for
me
i
would
like
it
more
full
bodied
d
so
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
perfect
light
summer
beer
first
time
with
the
style
as
im
sure
is
the
case
for
many
reviewing
this
so
not
sure
how
to
rate
for
a
beer
that
pushes
the
peach
id
expect
to
taste
it
more
pleasant
tart
thirstquencher
though
light
bodied
highly
carbonated
beer
cleanses
the
palate
well
easy
drinker
with
light
alcohol
taste
if
you
dont
mind
the
sourness
this
can
be
a
session
beer
overall
i
found
this
brew
quite
interesting
it
is
now
on
the
buy
again
list
as
well
as
a
note
to
try
others
of
the
style
m
d
very
carbonated
and
the
bubbles
tickle
my
tongue
i
could
drink
this
all
day
good
but
not
great
d
considering
my
negative
opinion
of
most
fruited
beers
i
wasnt
sure
about
this
one
but
i
rather
unexpectedly
ended
up
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
light
and
refreshing
with
only
a
hint
of
peach
considering
dfhs
typical
inyourface
style
this
one
was
very
subdued
pours
a
really
light
straw
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
wheaty
glow
to
it
aroma
of
dried
apricot
and
banana
bread
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
very
refreshing
flavor
is
of
tart
peach
soft
almost
hefeweizenlike
mouthfeel
ages
amazingly
well
served
from
bottle
into
a
dogfish
head
shaker
poured
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
none
almost
instantly
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
evident
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
peach
and
a
bitter
note
the
flavor
was
of
peach
malt
with
a
nice
peach
followthrough
on
the
palate
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
that
bad
for
the
style
i
have
had
a
few
from
this
style
and
hated
them
but
this
one
was
quite
drinkable
maybe
one
day
i
will
find
one
that
blows
me
away
but
this
one
was
a
good
start
i
do
not
enjoy
pouring
money
down
the
drain
so
no
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
any
more
of
this
tonight
or
ever
this
beer
has
its
place
however
in
the
same
way
that
smirnoff
ice
and
lethal
injection
have
their
place
i
really
was
excited
and
wanted
to
enjoy
this
unique
style
but
hell
no
where
is
the
appeal
pour
some
old
lemon
juice
on
a
slice
of
bread
squeeze
it
into
a
cup
add
a
tablespoon
of
blech
and
you
have
festina
peche
anyways
not
too
much
else
to
say
this
brew
is
not
for
everyone
but
it
suits
me
fine
nonbas
in
the
family
will
usually
even
add
an
ice
cube
or
two
to
this
one
and
chug
away
lady
loves
the
belgian
sours
and
will
swill
this
one
without
a
problem
festina
peche
is
also
quite
a
bit
cheaper
than
those
examples
if
you
are
on
a
budget
and
want
to
taste
something
sour
and
refreshing
d
good
due
to
the
light
body
and
refreshing
taste
low
abv
helps
as
well
only
thing
working
against
it
is
that
the
tartness
could
grow
old
a
refreshing
interesting
summer
brew
a
nice
departure
from
the
witbiers
and
pale
wheat
ales
that
are
standard
during
the
season
very
nice
ive
literally
been
drinking
this
beer
all
summer
and
marvel
at
its
drinkability
on
a
daily
basis
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
this
excellent
session
ale
and
its
really
nice
to
see
a
berliner
weisse
get
wide
distribution
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
and
it
is
by
far
the
worst
dogfish
head
beer
that
ive
had
i
went
out
on
a
limb
and
tried
this
festina
peche
but
better
fruity
beers
are
still
out
there
i
e
sweetwater
blue
and
a
local
one
ive
had
from
r
j
rockers
dont
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
im
just
not
a
fan
d
very
drinkable
especially
at
4
5
abv
and
on
a
hot
summer
day
pretty
wellbalanced
between
the
wheat
and
the
tartness
its
so
cool
to
me
that
a
large
brewery
like
dfh
would
release
an
oddball
style
of
beer
like
berliner
weiss
to
the
masses
overall
a
very
unique
beer
and
a
perfect
example
of
the
offcentered
brews
coming
out
of
dfh
bottle
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
hue
that
had
a
really
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipates
leaving
a
wispy
collar
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
straight
peach
on
this
followed
by
some
wheaty
undertones
initial
sip
gives
way
to
the
sweet
subdued
peach
taste
with
a
tart
feel
to
it
some
citrus
as
well
slight
bitterness
in
the
end
very
smooth
drinking
a
nice
summertime
drink
would
be
nice
with
a
touch
more
tartsour
light
medium
mouthfeel
dall
in
all
a
very
sessionable
summer
beer
due
to
the
low
abv
if
you
like
these
style
of
beers
very
light
and
refreshing
this
was
fun
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
several
and
not
be
bored
crap
very
drinkable
and
super
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
style
of
beer
has
been
at
the
forefront
of
my
attention
this
year
i
am
not
picking
up
on
the
peach
addition
at
all
in
this
brew
but
if
you
let
your
imagination
wonder
there
is
some
very
minor
resemblence
to
peach
skins
included
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
was
different
for
sure
im
glad
for
tasteing
it
but
i
prolly
wouldnt
buy
it
again
as
a
side
note
peaches
come
through
a
lot
more
when
it
warms
dr
fairly
balanced
and
refreshing
great
summer
brew
d
super
easy
to
drink
however
it
is
kinda
heavily
carbonated
so
i
would
find
it
hard
to
imagine
putting
down
more
than
a
couple
of
these
nice
for
a
relaxing
summer
day
should
be
much
more
drinkable
for
it
being
only
4
5
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
this
is
light
but
not
refreshing
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
again
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
summer
i
think
this
represents
the
style
well
the
peach
however
could
be
bumped
up
some
if
in
the
mood
for
a
bw
this
would
be
a
good
choice
d
goes
down
fast
and
easy
this
is
a
fairly
simple
thirst
quencher
that
is
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
something
interesting
to
drink
from
timetotime
as
a
nice
change
of
pace
an
interesting
taste
experience
nonetheless
2010
production
poured
with
almost
no
head
and
a
strawyellow
like
color
a
bit
of
haze
to
it
as
well
sour
fruits
peach
mostly
on
the
nose
slight
peach
taste
to
it
and
has
a
small
puckering
effect
on
your
mouth
this
was
the
first
of
the
festina
peches
that
ive
had
from
dogfish
head
so
i
dont
have
previous
years
to
compare
it
to
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
i
will
have
no
trouble
finishing
this
4pack
a
really
unique
brew
that
would
be
great
for
summer
parties
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
an
american
take
on
an
underappreciated
style
and
i
think
its
a
good
session
beer
for
summer
i
get
why
t
drinks
this
all
the
time
shes
a
smart
girl
with
great
tastes
in
both
beer
and
men
d
it
grows
on
you
if
very
cold
refreshing
with
an
open
mind
while
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
and
a
bit
apprehensive
i
was
fairly
impressed
and
though
it
is
not
something
i
will
seek
out
regularly
i
am
very
happy
that
i
gave
this
a
try
and
would
very
much
enjoy
trying
a
couple
more
very
very
drinkable
guzzleable
if
cold
in
fact
might
have
to
try
mixing
this
with
a
pale
andor
some
fruitier
brew
just
for
fun
nonclear
golden
color
with
virtually
no
head
you
can
lightly
smell
the
tart
fruit
and
malt
a
smoother
tartness
on
tap
with
light
fruit
and
malt
flavor
the
peach
is
not
in
the
forefront
its
blended
nicely
with
the
malts
the
tartness
is
the
main
thing
dfh
dialed
back
the
tartness
a
bit
for
2010
and
i
think
it
is
perfect
now
lovely
mouthfeel
for
summer
high
drinkability
since
its
so
light
and
tart
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
all
in
all
this
brew
disappointed
not
much
going
on
to
make
this
brew
worth
tying
i
love
many
dfh
brews
but
this
is
not
one
of
em
not
worth
your
time
poured
from
a
bottle
into
my
favorite
pint
glass
appearance
was
light
and
bright
smell
was
wheaty
and
peachy
nice
bright
smell
the
taste
was
light
as
well
with
a
small
amount
of
nice
peach
flavor
the
sourness
was
really
nice
as
well
my
favorite
was
the
mouthfeel
the
bubbles
were
very
tiny
and
smooth
drinkability
was
up
there
as
well
id
have
this
again
reviewed
blind
for
the
blind
beers
bif
here
we
go
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
straw
topped
by
some
white
foam
that
dies
faster
than
the
cubs
chances
for
a
title
the
nose
comprises
lemon
pulp
coriander
mandarin
oranges
sweet
corn
and
a
tiny
bit
o
flowers
the
taste
starts
with
some
nice
bitingly
tart
lemon
wedge
then
moves
into
some
green
apple
cardamom
coriander
and
a
late
sweetness
like
that
found
after
a
sour
patch
kid
has
been
in
your
mouth
awhile
the
body
is
light
with
a
moderately
active
carbonation
and
a
dry
almost
sticky
finish
i
was
thinking
wit
for
most
of
the
tasting
but
the
tartness
destroyed
that
possibility
i
had
forgotten
about
berliner
weisses
it
was
interesting
that
i
didnt
get
too
much
in
the
way
of
peaches
but
there
is
a
possibility
this
was
a
slightly
vintage
bottle
so
that
could
have
influenced
things
a
bit
good
times
regardless
but
right
now
its
like
100
degrees
and
im
having
a
hell
of
a
time
thinking
of
anything
else
that
would
be
working
better
overall
tasty
tart
and
very
drinkable
this
will
be
going
in
to
heavy
rotation
in
my
fridge
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
dr
very
good
nice
dessert
two
would
be
max
i
think
d
luckily
it
was
only
a
sample
i
gave
the
rest
to
soupedupdiesel
very
dinkable
d
not
bad
im
not
a
really
big
fan
of
it
but
i
like
the
novelty
and
would
be
willing
to
try
it
again
this
is
pretty
ideal
concoction
for
the
season
as
everything
is
super
crisp
and
light
im
not
sure
why
so
many
people
wrote
such
awful
reviews
as
if
they
were
blown
away
by
the
tart
and
fruit
aspects
being
this
is
a
berliner
weiss
inspired
brew
either
way
its
another
hit
from
dfh
for
me
good
for
a
hot
day
if
you
are
looking
for
an
alcoholic
peach
alternative
to
unsweetened
lemonade
it
does
not
drink
like
a
beer
at
all
at
least
in
the
traditional
sense
of
hops
and
malt
or
any
beer
ive
ever
had
pours
like
a
soda
with
a
sourtart
smell
tastes
sour
with
a
sour
finish
some
peach
flavor
there
but
more
lemony
citrus
than
peach
to
dfhs
credit
the
front
of
the
label
lists
it
as
a
malt
beverage
with
peach
concentrate
it
also
describes
it
as
unique
tart
and
refreshing
which
is
mostly
spot
on
it
also
seems
to
follow
much
of
the
berliner
weisse
description
in
terms
of
look
and
taste
so
i
cant
really
knock
it
i
just
wont
drink
it
when
i
want
a
beer
afternotes
not
at
all
surprised
to
see
the
style
hadnt
even
heard
of
it
i
had
heard
of
the
beer
though
and
just
hadnt
gotten
around
to
drinking
it
after
reading
the
description
of
the
style
this
fits
it
perfectly
now
i
just
have
to
try
more
within
the
style
to
find
out
this
beers
true
style
ratings
this
is
a
very
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
a
perfect
summertime
drink
this
beer
is
a
dead
ringer
on
appearance
for
the
style
definition
on
the
site
the
head
is
effervescent
the
color
is
pale
straw
and
it
is
clear
the
aroma
falls
a
bit
short
but
the
smell
of
peaches
does
come
through
very
strong
when
it
comes
to
taste
the
sourness
from
the
lacto
culture
complements
the
peaches
very
well
and
there
is
a
grainy
wheat
character
that
backs
both
up
the
carbonation
is
plentiful
and
appropriate
adding
to
the
light
body
of
this
beer
d
a
sessionable
sour
ale
for
8
a
4pk
ill
take
it
i
heard
they
changed
the
recipe
this
year
so
ill
have
to
get
a
newer
bottle
and
compare
i
hope
they
didnt
stray
too
far
as
this
is
a
good
one
a
great
summer
session
beverage
much
like
a
shandy
or
a
radler
added
to
my
outdoor
activity
menu
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
head
that
evaporates
immediately
as
is
the
style
characteristic
the
aroma
is
sour
patch
tart
with
a
hint
of
peach
and
some
grainy
wheat
aroma
the
flavor
is
quite
tart
up
front
with
an
acidic
bite
that
is
very
refreshing
it
also
has
a
very
wheaty
malt
flavor
as
well
as
some
peach
and
pear
notes
in
the
background
this
beer
is
quite
interesting
in
that
it
is
kind
of
like
a
berliner
weisse
mit
schuss
but
with
the
syrup
peach
in
this
case
built
in
i
was
skeptical
when
i
heard
about
this
at
first
but
it
works
quite
well
the
body
is
light
with
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
spiky
mouthfeel
that
is
quite
refreshing
it
is
also
one
of
the
lowest
abv
beers
that
dfh
makes
and
is
a
great
bbq
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
day
and
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
other
summer
wheat
beers
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
how
sweet
it
is
but
it
still
would
be
hard
to
have
multiple
of
these
d
ridiculously
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
the
tartness
stellar
summer
beer
but
there
are
many
that
id
buy
before
solid
overall
d
with
the
low
abv
the
just
right
level
of
tartness
and
the
natural
peach
flavors
this
downs
easy
and
you
could
probably
handle
a
fourpack
in
a
short
evening
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
strong
of
peaches
taste
starts
off
with
lots
of
peaches
then
becomes
tart
and
somewhat
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
overall
a
decent
drinkable
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
nothing
mind
blowing
for
a
bweisse
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
tartness
pretty
drinkable
if
you
can
get
by
the
artificial
peach
flavors
high
abv
for
style
and
mighty
good
drinkability
it
is
however
quite
boring
for
a
berliner
based
on
the
limited
few
examples
ive
had
if
anything
i
would
expect
dogfish
to
do
a
more
exteme
example
oh
well
poured
from
a
bottle
into
the
signature
dogfish
head
glass
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
little
head
to
speak
of
and
it
quickly
disappears
smell
is
strong
citrus
little
malt
underlying
peaches
taste
is
pleasantly
sour
and
tart
with
a
strong
lingering
orange
flavor
very
high
carbonation
but
it
works
here
as
it
increases
the
refreshment
very
drinkable
but
i
wonder
if
the
sweetness
would
be
a
bit
much
past
2
or
3
this
is
my
last
bottle
of
my
first
ever
4
pack
of
this
beer
i
will
buy
again
this
summer
and
will
make
it
a
summer
staple
from
this
year
forward
good
beer
edit
just
went
out
and
bought
a
case
of
this
beer
something
i
rarely
do
this
stuff
is
awesome
d
this
is
really
different
and
really
good
in
my
opinion
its
easily
one
of
the
most
refreshing
summer
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
its
an
easy
one
to
keep
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
picked
up
a
growler
for
a
cookout
it
seemed
like
a
good
choice
for
a
refreshing
summer
afternoon
brew
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
orange
very
light
with
an
almost
nonexistent
head
very
fizzy
though
aroma
was
dominated
by
wheat
and
peaches
ruhroh
what
have
i
done
taste
was
surprisingly
enjoyable
compared
to
the
bland
fruity
aroma
wheat
grains
with
some
peach
starchiness
with
a
puckering
sour
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
that
crisp
sour
finish
is
what
saved
this
beer
for
me
pretty
drinkable
but
its
definitely
something
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
to
have
again
the
peach
sweetness
gets
a
little
old
after
a
couple
worth
a
try
though
drinkability
not
a
bad
summer
drink
especially
on
a
day
like
today
when
it
was
over
100
outside
the
sweetness
is
too
much
to
really
have
numerous
bottles
of
this
at
one
sitting
im
a
huge
fan
of
dogfish
head
and
festina
peche
is
one
of
those
beers
that
can
only
be
drank
when
in
the
mood
american
sour
peach
beer
very
interesting
nice
beer
just
very
different
this
is
the
2010
batch
pours
a
very
cloudy
applecider
color
in
the
nose
i
pick
up
peaches
and
some
interesting
sweetness
i
also
pick
up
sour
notes
and
maybe
a
bit
of
green
apple
wow
this
is
a
lot
different
than
the
2009
version
i
had
not
too
long
ago
the
2009
had
a
lot
more
sourness
the
peach
is
much
more
detectable
here
and
im
having
a
hard
time
deciding
which
version
i
enjoyed
more
immediately
im
getting
a
bit
of
sourness
followed
quickly
by
strong
peach
and
nectarine
flavors
then
ending
with
a
very
subtle
sour
taste
i
take
that
back
this
beer
really
isnt
even
sour
anymore
just
mellowly
tart
i
must
say
this
version
may
have
better
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
and
crisp
i
know
for
sure
this
will
get
more
people
liking
this
beer
converting
sour
haters
a
bit
interesting
change
in
flavor
dogfish
still
not
sure
which
version
i
like
better
but
both
are
very
good
not
much
in
the
appearance
to
this
one
the
fizzy
head
faded
out
rather
quickly
leaving
no
lace
beer
itself
is
a
cloudy
golden
straw
color
not
sure
whats
going
on
in
the
smell
catagory
the
only
thing
i
got
was
a
faint
hint
of
malt
not
much
else
taste
was
better
more
malt
and
slightly
sour
with
a
hint
of
peach
its
a
nice
light
beer
great
for
the
hot
summers
down
here
probably
wouldnt
be
to
bad
at
the
beach
either
as
usual
a
unique
experience
from
dfh
that
must
be
tried
it
certainly
wasnt
much
to
look
at
but
it
has
a
nice
refreshingly
sour
quality
to
it
its
not
overly
fruity
but
it
was
a
little
like
sipping
a
soda
i
also
would
have
rated
it
higher
but
it
had
a
fairly
salty
finish
which
usually
would
come
with
some
sort
of
herbal
accompaniment
but
i
couldnt
quite
pick
anything
out
so
it
became
more
like
a
seltzer
water
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
nice
variation
on
a
wheat
the
dry
sweetness
lent
by
the
fruit
balanced
by
the
hops
make
it
an
easy
drink
to
come
back
to
its
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
one
id
be
inclined
to
drink
regularly
d
not
my
favorite
everyday
drinking
beer
but
this
is
a
welcome
change
from
the
many
strong
bold
flavored
beers
i
regularly
drink
i
do
however
vaguely
remember
liking
last
years
batch
better
but
this
is
fairly
delicious
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
has
good
flavor
and
is
low
in
alcohol
content
its
a
decent
session
beer
it
makes
me
sad
that
this
is
the
only
berliner
weissbier
i
can
get
my
hands
on
ive
only
ever
had
one
other
back
when
founders
had
one
in
their
repertoire
but
that
was
long
ago
and
lost
to
the
fog
of
beer
drinkability
pleasantly
surprised
that
the
peach
was
not
overdone
making
it
cloying
not
my
favorite
summer
beer
but
refreshing
nonetheless
this
is
a
great
summer
seasonal
that
isnt
done
often
enough
why
didnt
i
find
this
earlier
you
gotta
try
this
d
a
solid
summer
refresher
i
dont
know
how
many
i
could
have
in
one
sitting
but
one
bottle
sure
hit
the
spot
d
i
couldnt
help
but
think
this
was
misclassified
from
a
lambic
on
flavor
alone
but
after
research
i
found
it
actually
nailed
the
style
thatll
teach
me
to
assume
i
know
what
im
getting
my
wife
enjoyed
it
very
much
beer
is
thin
and
mildly
sour
its
very
drinkable
and
there
is
some
nice
carbonation
in
the
mouth
that
accents
the
peach
flavors
well
im
in
good
company
when
i
say
that
this
is
not
exactly
a
berleinerweiss
but
its
a
decent
sour
wheat
with
fruit
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
had
the
luck
to
find
it
on
tap
at
whole
foods
was
not
even
expecting
much
from
it
except
a
drinkable
summer
drink
but
it
turned
out
great
slightly
sour
aromatic
tasty
as
hell
and
perfect
for
a
summer
drink
not
sweet
but
not
at
all
bitter
exceptional
warm
weather
drink
pours
a
pale
yellow
without
too
much
head
a
very
sweet
peach
smell
with
some
lemon
too
i
think
flavour
has
lots
of
peach
but
i
get
a
mild
pleasant
bitterness
too
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bit
thin
but
still
a
really
nice
summer
beer
id
never
turn
this
down
but
i
am
unlikely
to
seek
out
again
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
color
which
when
poured
the
head
disappears
immediately
after
the
pour
there
is
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
citrus
smell
with
some
sweet
notes
and
a
hint
of
peach
the
taste
is
tart
and
sour
up
front
with
a
light
champagne
type
taste
at
the
backend
a
peach
sweetness
is
present
the
mouthfeel
is
stingy
and
crisp
like
a
sparkling
wine
with
a
low
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
the
taste
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
for
the
style
a
very
solid
selection
it
pours
a
very
light
gold
with
no
head
whatsoever
it
smells
a
bit
sour
with
a
nice
hint
of
the
peaches
when
i
taste
it
it
is
tart
and
makes
me
pucker
up
just
a
bit
in
a
good
way
next
comes
the
peach
flavors
which
are
subtle
and
the
finish
is
crisp
after
i
had
the
glass
it
made
me
salivate
and
yearn
for
more
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
to
try
once
yes
it
is
a
sour
beer
and
america
needs
to
get
used
to
the
style
it
is
such
an
amazing
style
of
beer
mild
aroma
of
yeast
and
a
bit
of
bright
lemon
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pleasantly
full
mouthfeel
the
taste
bursts
immediately
with
citrus
peach
and
a
surprising
sourness
the
finish
leaves
a
lingering
tart
green
apple
flavor
interesting
and
drinkable
though
one
was
plenty
summer
brew
i
am
a
big
fan
of
other
dogfish
beers
the
90
minute
is
simply
amazing
but
they
really
need
to
stop
making
this
beer
all
together
if
you
are
into
sweetlight
beers
there
are
many
others
with
better
flavor
that
you
can
choose
from
dogfish
black
blue
allagash
white
or
even
a
leines
summer
shandy
all
i
feel
are
more
drinkable
d
my
first
experience
with
this
style
and
im
very
pleased
with
dfhs
version
i
can
see
knocking
back
a
four
pack
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
dfh
has
packed
some
crazy
flavor
into
a
4
5
abv
beer
very
drinkable
summer
pool
side
beer
drinkability
is
enjoyable
for
a
nice
light
tart
summer
brew
tastes
like
summer
not
the
summer
you
went
to
mexico
and
came
back
with
the
trots
and
sores
on
your
mouth
the
summer
that
was
actually
completely
awesome
pours
a
pale
cloudy
yellow
faint
peachy
aroma
tart
flavor
hits
right
away
peach
green
apple
and
hints
of
lemon
semi
sour
can
feel
it
back
in
your
jaw
finishes
with
a
little
caramel
and
honey
malt
also
noticed
some
bready
salty
and
toasted
notes
deep
in
the
beer
a
lot
of
flavors
combining
very
light
mouthfeel
and
very
carbonated
d
goes
down
easily
not
filling
nice
beer
that
really
hit
the
spot
light
summer
beer
that
you
can
sit
with
for
a
decent
period
of
time
dits
light
and
low
alcohol
but
its
not
sessionable
for
me
unless
im
out
out
in
the
sun
for
a
long
time
but
i
cant
really
see
myself
drinking
this
all
day
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
the
year
and
i
want
to
keep
putting
them
down
much
better
on
tap
than
in
bottle
tastes
sour
almost
mouth
puckering
tart
is
a
better
word
finishes
with
a
slight
peach
aftertaste
this
one
leaves
your
thirst
quenched
and
longing
for
more
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
sparkling
all
in
all
leaving
this
beer
one
of
the
most
unique
sessionhotsummerday
beer
i
have
ever
tried
i
wish
i
could
get
it
in
a
12pk
in
my
area
love
this
beer
d
low
drinkability
ive
now
had
a
few
of
these
and
wish
i
would
have
had
fewer
without
a
doubt
the
worst
berliner
weisse
ive
had
by
a
long
long
shot
it
si
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
the
dfh
offering
is
too
uneven
and
the
best
ive
had
wasnt
good
enough
ive
now
given
them
a
few
chances
and
am
done
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
its
a
light
tart
refreshing
beer
that
i
can
definitely
relate
to
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
isnt
a
style
that
i
encounter
too
often
and
it
was
pretty
decent
but
there
were
a
few
others
ive
tried
that
i
liked
better
really
like
that
they
make
a
summer
beer
that
is
so
different
then
all
the
others
though
taste
in
your
face
sour
apple
thats
definitely
on
the
light
and
crisp
side
without
the
depth
of
complexity
of
a
sour
belgian
the
fizzy
carbonation
combined
with
the
sourness
really
perks
up
your
tongue
and
is
very
intense
once
acclimated
to
the
sour
bite
caramel
and
bread
come
through
without
even
a
modicum
of
bitterness
or
hop
presence
malts
come
through
a
bit
more
in
the
middle
honey
and
caramel
playing
the
role
of
sweet
opposite
the
everpresent
sour
fresh
fruits
make
an
appearance
as
well
mostly
peach
with
lemon
finish
is
lemon
juice
that
has
a
blunted
sour
character
caramel
which
lingers
with
an
almost
herbal
undercurrent
to
the
sour
note
notes
very
drinkable
mainly
because
it
is
so
light
and
relatively
devoid
of
any
major
flavor
o
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
is
brewed
to
style
a
very
nice
summertime
session
beer
no
noticeable
defects
recommend
drink
very
fresh
d
ill
stick
to
one
and
honestly
probably
wont
purchase
anytime
soon
but
its
interesting
d
this
is
a
tough
one
casual
drinkers
would
probably
take
one
sip
of
this
and
spit
as
would
most
novice
craft
drinkers
i
think
i
can
appreciate
this
style
id
buy
again
though
i
dont
know
if
i
will
this
season
definitely
an
interesting
experience
with
my
first
sour
the
fizziness
dances
in
your
mouth
and
the
light
mouthfeel
is
very
refreshing
if
not
for
the
high
carbonation
you
could
easily
chug
this
beer
and
then
come
back
for
many
more
without
much
of
an
effect
d
love
this
beer
my
favorite
summer
seasonal
ive
ever
had
actually
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
it
but
the
best
thing
is
just
how
refreshing
this
is
lovely
beer
pours
a
hazy
transparent
yelow
color
with
little
to
no
head
little
to
no
lacing
and
flat
carbonation
peachy
fruity
smell
which
was
expected
looks
almost
more
like
juice
than
beer
peachy
seltzer
like
flavor
that
was
very
enjoyable
light
body
that
had
a
fizzy
sweet
and
tart
finish
and
taste
thin
slick
texture
and
average
flavor
duration
definitely
something
different
than
your
average
beer
very
good
would
definitely
drink
again
the
body
was
ok
light
and
crisp
with
the
remaining
carbonation
providing
some
life
across
the
tongue
drinkability
was
ok
as
well
not
great
not
terrible
overall
a
kind
of
bland
take
on
the
style
over
all
a
good
session
sour
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
d
drinks
extremely
easy
its
very
refreshing
im
drinking
this
after
a
loooong
day
of
fishing
in
the
hot
warmer
sun
bright
and
acidic
mouthfeel
nice
and
puckering
without
being
overwhelming
smooth
and
crisp
but
maybe
a
bit
thin
overall
a
nice
and
refreshing
change
of
pace
for
a
summer
beer
the
fruit
is
subtle
but
it
has
a
nice
range
of
flavors
throughout
d
festina
is
something
different
i
give
dfh
credit
for
staying
committed
to
this
style
you
can
drink
many
of
these
and
still
let
out
a
sour
smile
i
will
always
seek
out
some
of
these
during
the
summer
days
because
they
can
be
pounded
ridicuosly
well
drinkability
theres
really
not
a
lot
to
this
beer
its
easy
to
drink
has
a
simple
refreshing
taste
to
it
and
its
going
pretty
well
with
the
summer
afternoon
it
isnt
great
but
it
isnt
bad
either
id
say
if
youre
a
fan
of
dfh
that
its
worth
a
try
but
to
be
honest
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
trying
to
score
a
sixer
of
this
d
style
wise
i
think
i
can
see
why
the
germans
mix
it
with
sweet
syrups
d
this
is
another
unique
beer
from
dfh
nice
refreshing
brew
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
preferred
last
years
version
when
it
was
more
tart
and
less
wheaty
d
not
a
very
good
beer
the
nose
was
non
existent
and
the
taste
had
tart
and
very
little
peach
taste
my
girlfriend
usually
likes
fruitier
beers
but
neither
of
us
enjoyed
this
one
wouldnt
try
again
md
it
is
thin
and
light
very
easy
to
drink
it
works
well
as
a
summer
beer
and
great
on
a
hot
day
out
in
the
back
yard
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
really
wasnt
a
huge
fan
but
am
finding
myself
enjoying
it
more
and
appreciating
the
style
more
as
well
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
peaches
with
some
light
tartness
and
some
wheat
the
flavor
is
wheat
and
peaches
with
only
a
little
bit
of
tartness
light
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
but
i
wish
the
beer
was
a
little
more
tart
d
very
drinkable
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
with
even
bitter
for
the
rest
of
the
balance
play
some
allman
brothers
while
drinking
this
one
preferably
somewhere
sunny
at
first
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
with
this
beer
but
then
i
reviewed
the
style
berliner
weissbier
and
found
it
very
true
to
form
not
my
favorite
beer
from
dogfish
head
but
kudos
to
them
for
brewing
a
style
that
is
a
bit
offcentered
cheers
mediumlight
body
with
moderately
high
carbonation
fairly
light
and
somewhat
crisp
refreshing
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
hot
day
would
try
again
drinkability
is
alright
i
woul
enjoy
some
more
sweetness
and
peach
flavors
but
then
again
this
is
my
first
for
the
style
d
goes
down
real
smooth
a
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
i
cant
get
enough
of
these
not
bad
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
though
it
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
overall
there
is
not
a
lot
here
barely
any
sour
tart
fruit
or
otherwise
just
kind
of
blah
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
thin
fast
fading
white
head
leaving
a
couple
blobs
of
coarse
lace
smell
a
little
hay
and
green
grass
peach
nectarine
it
smells
dry
taste
wheat
cracker
tart
slightly
sweet
unripe
peach
nectarine
definite
lactic
character
but
its
got
a
good
dose
of
sweetness
quite
light
with
a
tart
drying
finish
pretty
straightforward
but
enjoyable
the
fruit
both
complements
and
mitigates
the
tartness
so
this
would
be
a
good
intro
to
the
style
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
a
beer
of
this
style
it
is
nice
and
pretty
refreshing
very
fruity
but
it
works
here
unlike
some
beers
outside
of
the
usual
lambics
and
unibroue
offerings
while
it
isnt
so
much
my
thing
though
i
might
get
it
again
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
others
who
are
curious
i
really
liked
this
and
its
okay
when
someone
might
not
i
feel
its
worth
having
and
it
a
great
representation
of
the
style
dogfish
head
festina
peche
poured
a
hazy
color
with
a
small
head
that
disapated
quickly
it
smelt
and
tasted
very
much
the
same
tart
and
very
peachy
there
were
no
beer
flavors
it
was
like
drinking
peach
juice
i
couldnt
finish
one
if
you
love
peaches
you
will
probailly
enjoy
this
beer
however
if
you
do
not
love
peaches
its
not
very
good
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
beer
no
real
flaws
that
prevent
me
from
ordering
a
2nd
glass
from
pint
glass
poured
out
a
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
slight
fizziness
no
head
that
abruptly
died
off
there
is
a
citrusy
aroma
and
a
very
subtle
hint
of
peach
that
could
very
well
go
unnoticed
to
me
this
beer
was
reminiscent
of
a
shandy
or
a
radler
it
tastes
like
a
very
light
wheat
beer
with
a
little
lemonade
concentrate
mixed
in
i
was
looking
foward
to
a
nice
summer
replacement
for
my
beloved
aprihop
but
to
no
avail
i
can
see
how
this
beer
can
be
slammed
back
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
so
can
michelob
ultra
lime
for
the
same
reasons
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
dogfish
head
d
not
a
style
i
am
familiar
with
at
all
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
interesting
flavors
and
i
really
like
the
level
of
tartness
in
this
one
refreshing
would
be
great
for
a
hot
day
goes
down
rather
well
not
quite
sour
not
quite
sweet
not
quite
malty
not
quite
hoppy
but
overall
not
bad
either
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
overall
first
time
trying
this
beer
style
poured
cloudy
copper
orange
half
a
finger
of
head
with
short
lived
white
foamy
head
aroma
of
weat
grassy
barn
yard
wet
hay
and
some
fruit
starts
off
bubbly
in
the
tip
of
the
tongue
exploding
into
a
sour
mash
party
i
wasnt
expecting
the
sour
taiste
but
it
lended
to
the
fruity
tones
but
no
peach
similar
to
bad
pineapple
interesting
overall
pours
an
almost
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
an
impressive
couple
inches
of
dense
white
foam
on
top
aromas
of
white
peaches
chardonnay
and
lactic
sourness
there
is
a
slight
sourness
on
the
palate
with
some
wheat
some
sweetness
apples
and
peaches
alright
but
nothing
earthshattering
going
on
here
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thinnish
bubbly
white
head
that
disappears
almost
instantly
staring
into
the
glass
this
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
smells
of
light
sweet
malts
tart
and
sour
fruit
and
juicy
peaches
sweet
fruits
appear
at
first
sip
then
fade
quickly
taste
is
a
bit
tart
with
the
lactic
piercing
the
tongue
with
lemons
sweet
and
tart
in
the
mouth
medium
carbonation
and
body
light
highly
quaffable
brew
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
these
on
a
hot
day
clear
pale
straw
gold
in
color
highly
carbonated
wheaty
slightly
lactic
peach
aroma
flavor
is
light
sour
and
quite
tangy
slightly
funky
wonder
what
kind
of
yeast
they
use
very
effervescent
awesomely
refreshing
a
summer
favorite
of
mine
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
festina
peche
is
a
nice
straw
yellow
color
but
im
disappointed
by
the
complete
lack
of
any
head
formation
and
thus
no
lace
either
this
is
my
first
berliner
weiss
and
i
know
not
to
expect
much
in
the
way
of
a
head
but
id
like
something
the
nose
is
largely
of
peaches
but
it
seems
fairly
mutedweak
and
i
havent
had
a
problem
picking
up
aromas
from
my
other
beers
tonight
a
few
sips
raise
my
opinion
of
this
beer
greatly
as
dogfish
head
absolutely
nailed
it
with
how
tart
they
made
this
beer
it
stops
just
a
bit
short
of
becoming
overwhelming
the
peach
flavor
is
a
fantastic
balance
to
the
sourness
and
really
rounds
out
the
beer
well
the
body
is
light
and
festina
peche
is
highly
carbonated
which
works
well
with
this
beer
its
almost
ridiculous
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
especially
given
the
sour
aspect
id
love
to
spend
a
summer
afternoon
leisurely
working
through
a
few
of
these
drinkability
refreshing
and
flavorful
d
i
am
impressed
with
the
fact
that
fp
delivered
a
taste
of
the
berliner
weisse
and
even
more
so
with
the
fact
that
it
was
accomplished
without
bacteria
this
is
the
best
fruit
beer
ive
had
by
far
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
berliner
weisse
d
not
a
big
fan
of
the
berliner
weiss
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
id
like
to
give
a
fresh
batch
of
this
a
try
as
the
sourness
was
very
compelling
this
isnt
meant
to
age
this
long
but
i
think
it
held
up
reasonably
well
worth
the
mix
6
add
for
sure
d
well
this
definitely
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
styles
out
there
at
least
for
me
and
this
is
no
exception
light
lively
carbonation
and
a
great
sourtart
flavor
throw
in
a
low
4
5
alcohol
level
and
heres
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
all
day
think
ill
be
grabbing
more
of
this
in
the
summer
when
this
will
really
shine
drinkability
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
really
couldnt
get
into
it
but
now
i
feel
i
can
appreciate
and
enjoy
it
i
would
find
this
quite
refreshing
in
the
summer
and
with
the
low
abv
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
but
would
limit
it
two
probably
two
because
of
the
acidity
d
goes
down
easy
with
a
little
tartness
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
pairings
sunshine
paella
sushi
and
grilled
poultry
overall
i
think
they
hit
their
mark
im
just
left
to
wonder
why
d
not
much
drinkability
here
its
ok
for
what
it
is
a
sour
but
i
wouldnt
sit
down
and
drink
a
sixer
of
this
or
anything
fairly
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
not
really
something
i
will
seek
out
this
brew
is
like
a
hybrid
of
a
cider
and
a
wild
ale
its
sour
and
then
sweet
and
of
course
back
to
sour
again
very
tasty
but
i
definitely
couldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
d
hot
hot
hot
weather
malt
beverage
you
need
to
be
overheated
and
sweaty
to
really
enjoy
this
thirst
quencher
its
perfect
for
those
conditions
but
certainly
not
an
everyday
brew
a
good
drink
for
the
right
mood
im
trying
this
one
after
a
session
in
the
salt
water
but
it
has
taken
me
six
weeks
to
drink
three
out
of
the
four
pack
overall
i
will
probably
buy
this
again
a
solid
berliner
that
deserves
a
try
4
0
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
simple
brew
but
it
isnt
half
bad
and
quite
refreshing
though
one
might
be
enough
d
excellent
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
easy
going
beer
i
just
tried
this
for
the
first
time
recently
but
i
can
say
with
certainty
that
this
will
be
a
frequent
go
to
beer
for
the
hot
southern
california
months
ahead
overall
very
very
easy
drinking
people
who
only
like
one
style
or
are
new
to
craft
beer
will
not
be
shocked
and
appalled
by
this
it
is
beerlike
but
the
sour
note
will
throw
them
off
worth
trying
this
one
if
new
to
the
style
well
they
cant
all
be
winners
my
wife
picked
this
out
thinking
a
fruit
beer
would
be
a
nice
thing
to
try
and
we
fuckin
hated
it
its
a
pretty
dark
gold
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
peach
with
lots
of
hops
the
taste
is
godawful
it
stings
and
is
super
sour
i
almost
couldnt
swallow
it
because
it
was
so
bad
and
it
left
an
awful
aftertaste
three
sips
was
enough
before
it
went
down
the
drain
absolutely
never
again
with
this
one
tasty
and
extremely
refreshing
beer
here
id
love
to
see
more
american
brewers
give
this
style
a
chance
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
dogfish
head
rarely
lets
me
down
poured
a
hazy
orange
thick
looking
color
smell
was
subdued
peaches
that
werent
fake
like
out
of
a
can
with
a
slight
sour
note
taste
was
clean
peachy
not
overwhelming
but
not
very
complex
the
wheat
showed
through
as
well
as
a
little
yeast
with
a
tart
finish
not
bad
and
possibly
my
first
for
this
style
my
first
time
drinking
the
berliner
weissbier
style
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
although
dfh
rarely
does
what
one
expects
pours
a
very
light
hazed
straw
color
with
a
very
quickly
dissipating
film
like
head
a
lot
of
white
wine
sauv
blanc
like
aromas
with
light
peach
sweet
yeast
and
apples
taste
is
really
really
tart
whew
lemon
juice
green
apples
faint
peach
some
cider
qualities
very
interesting
champagne
carbonation
mouthfeel
a
little
too
tart
for
me
right
now
but
i
could
drink
em
on
new
years
as
a
champagne
sub
poured
a
golden
wheat
yellow
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
decent
retention
smell
was
earthy
then
strong
citrusy
lemon
and
very
bitter
peach
taste
was
similar
light
wheat
then
moving
to
strong
citrusy
taste
almost
like
biting
into
a
lemon
not
a
particularly
balanced
beer
imo
not
bad
but
not
my
style
drinkability
raise
the
drinkability
also
because
this
was
so
refreshing
and
the
abv
is
nice
and
low
yet
it
packs
so
much
flavor
easlily
went
through
the
4
pack
drinkability
for
as
tart
as
this
is
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
given
time
now
that
i
am
typing
this
out
i
know
what
this
reminds
me
of
taste
wise
growing
up
for
some
odd
reason
i
use
to
steal
the
lemon
juice
from
our
fridge
and
try
to
concoct
lemonade
with
it
by
adding
sugar
it
never
turned
out
right
and
you
would
always
drink
nine
tenths
of
the
watersugarlemon
juice
mixture
before
getting
any
sweetness
hence
for
most
of
the
time
you
were
drinking
bitter
tasting
water
that
is
what
this
beer
tastes
like
it
reminds
me
of
lemon
juice
and
a
hint
of
peach
flavor
added
to
it
that
is
the
puckering
effect
i
am
remembering
from
when
i
was
a
child
making
that
drink
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
beer
but
i
would
probably
not
seek
it
out
in
the
future
an
interesting
experience
indeed
d
pretty
sessionable
for
the
style
would
be
great
during
the
summer
heat
d
the
taste
is
light
and
fresh
so
its
definitely
a
good
summer
beer
however
the
sour
flavor
lingers
in
the
mouth
and
im
not
sure
i
would
be
able
to
drink
this
for
an
extended
period
of
time
or
number
of
beers
it
would
be
great
with
a
light
and
fresh
summer
meal
to
balance
out
the
strong
accents
of
the
beer
d
i
love
this
style
and
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
i
have
had
the
peach
gives
it
just
enough
sweetness
this
would
go
great
with
just
about
any
meal
overall
its
not
a
style
im
overly
familiar
with
and
must
admit
to
being
taken
aback
just
a
little
bit
but
i
believe
its
grown
on
me
though
unique
it
would
probably
benefit
better
from
warmer
weather
pours
very
clear
pale
yellow
with
almost
no
carbonation
at
all
just
slightly
hazy
otherwise
it
looks
like
any
pilser
or
macro
the
smell
is
very
nonsescript
maybe
a
hint
of
malt
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
mouth
puckering
sour
wow
its
like
chewing
on
a
fresh
lime
refreshing
but
so
sour
it
reminds
me
of
overstrong
lemonade
hey
i
say
give
it
a
try
drinkability
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
i
feel
like
it
would
be
out
of
place
neither
at
a
fashionable
soirée
nor
a
barbecue
good
stuff
d
edit
the
new
version
2010
sucks
not
sour
it
is
a
peach
fruit
beer
booo
hiss
pppbbbfff
i
give
it
the
bronx
cheer
apparently
festina
pêche
is
fairly
true
to
style
and
the
style
is
not
for
me
i
am
hoping
for
some
improvement
after
it
warms
up
but
i
hope
in
vain
just
plain
bad
tasted
sour
off
the
first
taste
slowly
tasting
of
sour
peaches
and
a
nice
wheat
body
on
it
slightly
watery
as
most
wheat
beers
seem
to
taste
but
a
great
light
beer
i
think
this
could
be
very
drinkable
if
it
were
not
for
the
hefty
price
tag
nice
and
refreshing
in
the
end
overall
and
interesting
beer
im
glad
i
tried
probably
wont
purchase
again
a
less
sour
and
watery
2010
festina
peche
recieves
a
new
score
of
3

brew
in
2011
drinkability
you
know
i
love
peach
one
of
my
favorite
flavors
but
this
beer
is
so
complex
and
just
entirely
different
that
im
torn
i
am
impressed
in
its
complexity
and
characteristics
however
it
needs
to
be
sipped
and
then
should
be
paired
with
food
to
help
deal
with
the
sugar
i
would
say
you
need
heavy
chocolate
to
compliment
it
bottom
line
is
its
a
great
beer
but
not
one
to
have
over
and
over
again
d
great
wonderful
overall
a
really
good
beer
for
the
berliner
style
overall
impressions
certainly
works
well
for
warm
weather
and
is
better
very
cold
very
champagnelike
to
drink
ok
beer
but
i
have
no
need
to
buy
it
again
simply
not
my
preference
d
a
tasty
tart
brew
this
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
tart
cantillon
gueuze
but
not
at
that
level
of
quality
if
you
dont
like
sour
tasting
things
this
one
probably
wont
be
for
you
if
you
do
like
them
however
im
pretty
sure
youll
enjoy
this
this
is
the
first
berliner
weissbier
ive
had
but
based
on
the
description
this
seems
to
be
true
to
style
im
going
to
try
to
find
more
beers
in
this
style
now
especially
in
the
summer
d
good
goes
down
smoothly
reminds
me
sort
of
a
champagne
tartness
is
very
refreshing
hazed
pale
blonde
with
a
fine
lean
white
head
that
leaves
blobs
of
sliding
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
super
concentrated
peach
with
a
wisp
of
wheat
malt
tart
and
acidic
mouth
puckering
lemon
juice
and
a
touch
of
peach
to
take
the
edge
off
not
my
favorite
but
the
flavors
fit
the
style
definition
to
a
tee
light
bodied
and
super
carbonated
this
beer
is
for
people
who
like
extremely
bitter
flavors
with
little
to
no
sweetness
to
balance
color
is
a
pale
yellow
with
an
almost
nonexistent
white
head
aroma
is
a
mild
sourness
not
very
inviting
taste
is
extremely
sour
and
tart
with
little
discernable
malt
reminds
me
of
nerds
or
sour
patch
kids
not
sure
if
that
is
what
they
were
going
for
but
if
it
is
they
nailed
it
body
is
light
to
medium
with
somewhat
high
carbonation
although
this
is
a
bit
like
sucking
a
lemon
it
grew
on
me
as
i
worked
through
it
nevertheless
this
is
not
my
style
and
i
will
not
be
revisiting
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
pale
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
large
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
of
tart
peaches
and
yeast
the
taste
is
also
tart
peaches
and
yeast
with
a
tart
aftertaste
light
bodied
decent
carbonation
dry
and
fairly
drinkable
i
have
really
liked
everything
i
have
had
from
dogfish
head
until
now
but
this
one
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
overall
this
may
not
have
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
first
time
i
had
it
but
it
has
since
become
one
of
my
go
to
summer
seasonal
staples
so
refreashing
on
a
warm
day
and
reasonably
priced
my
least
favorite
brew

decants
hazy
cloudy
yellow
with
a
generous
frothy
white
cap
with
good
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
heavily
yeasty
with
sour
lemonslimes
and
grapefruit
and
a
barnyardwet
blanket
sort
of
profile
and
a
smidgen
of
apricot
the
taste
is
full
on
tart
yeasty
peaches
with
white
grapes
hay
and
a
sour
funk
finishes
astringent
puckering
bitter
and
tart
creamy
yet
dry
low
in
alcohol
and
as
a
result
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
excellent
thanks
mike
drinkability
its
drinkable
but
more
of
an
acquired
taste
not
something
id
seek
out
if
you
can
stand
the
sour
this
is
quite
drinkable
if
not
then
you
may
end
up
with
a
drain
pour
im
trying
my
best
to
avoid
doing
that
but
this
beer
is
just
too
much
for
me
i
kind
of
wish
they
had
indicated
on
the
label
just
exactly
what
this
beer
is
all
about
my
first
sip
came
as
quite
the
shock
very
refreshing
first
sip
just
finished
a
workout
so
definitely
appreciated
the
tart
flavor
is
overwhelming
the
peach
but
truly
delicious
there
is
a
bit
of
a
champagne
tastefeel
in
there
just
like
the
smell
i
really
wish
i
had
saved
more
of
this
for
the
winter
i
have
one
more
left
so
if
it
keeps
well
i
will
get
a
case
or
more
next
year
to
hold
onto
through
the
cooler
months
taste
cheekpuckering
tartness
peach
comes
through
nicely
and
is
a
good
pairing
for
the
sour
of
the
berliner
weissbier
style
the
wheat
malt
is
only
really
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
not
what
i
like
to
drink
to
me
its
more
a
soda
beverage
with
some
beer
added
to
it
very
tart
and
smells
like
rubber
very
thin
head
disappearing
quickly
i
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
wish
to
try
this
beer
again
this
would
be
a
really
nice
beer
if
it
didnt
smell
so
bad
i
dont
understand
it
at
all
because
it
didnt
taste
anything
like
it
smelled
oh
well
id
rather
it
smell
funky
but
taste
good
than
the
other
way
around
yet
another
interesting
creation
from
dogfish
head
this
beer
may
be
lacking
in
color
looks
like
miller
high
life
and
smell
literally
has
none
but
in
my
opinion
it
has
a
great
refreshing
taste
to
it
im
shocked
its
only
averaging
a
b
it
has
a
great
tartsour
feel
for
it
that
makes
it
almost
close
to
a
lambic
or
sour
this
paired
with
a
nice
peach
taste
and
great
drinkability
makes
it
an
altogether
very
solid
beer
very
pale
yellow
color
that
is
easily
seen
through
very
small
head
that
dissipated
almost
immediately
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
very
wheaty
and
citrusy
the
taste
is
very
sour
lemony
and
peachy
it
is
very
tarty
and
that
overwhelms
the
beer
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
is
very
unique
very
drinkable
and
a
good
buy
during
summer
i
love
sour
things
like
lemons
pickles
and
green
apples
i
love
beer
i
love
dfh
no
brainer
hey
this
beer
is
one
i
could
keep
in
my
fridge
all
year
round
especially
the
summer
ive
had
limited
berliners
and
need
to
add
them
to
my
brewing
collection
d
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
brew
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
dfh
thus
far
very
drinkable
the
kings
of
hop
overall
its
a
very
interesting
beer
not
the
best
berliner
weis
ive
ever
had
but
pretty
decent
too
d
extremly
high
you
just
cant
help
but
not
get
this
one
down
fast
tart
refreshing
this
would
be
fantastic
on
a
hot
day
working
in
the
backyard
havent
had
any
other
berliner
weissbiers
but
this
one
seems
to
hit
on
every
note
mentioned
in
the
description
for
some
reason
i
love
what
this
beer
is
and
cant
wait
to
try
more
in
this
style
d
vinegary
taste
is
a
little
too
dominant
for
me
to
ever
want
another
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
peachflavored
beer
but
im
not
disappointed
either
this
is
my
first
berliner
weisse
and
only
my
2nd
dogfish
head
beer
i
am
intrigued
and
will
seek
out
both
the
style
and
the
brewery
again
12oz
bottle
served
at
47
degrees
in
a
standard
pint
glass
bottled
in
2009
indicated
on
the
bottle
poured
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
half
inch
bright
white
head
that
reduced
its
volume
by
half
in
less
the
15
seconds
before
settling
into
a
small
slick
with
a
tight
band
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
no
lacing
on
this
one
mild
nose
prickly
citrus
and
light
fruity
esters
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
citrus
is
expressed
more
as
citric
acid
than
any
definable
fruit
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
wheat
comes
out
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
and
very
lively
with
a
great
deal
of
astringency
that
puckers
the
cheeks
and
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
before
culminating
in
a
tart
dry
finish
just
starting
to
explore
this
style
and
i
found
festina
peche
to
be
quite
drinkable
flavorful
and
refreshing
abv
makes
it
quite
sessionable
but
astringency
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
after
more
than
a
couple
nonetheless
a
great
example
of
the
style
my
only
complaint
is
that
on
moving
this
to
largescale
production
they
stopped
souring
with
natural
bacteria
i
say
this
because
the
sour
character
is
slightly
harsher
and
more
onedimensional
compared
with
other
sour
beers
and
compared
to
when
they
first
brewed
this
at
their
brewpub
it
also
lacks
some
of
the
aromas
generated
by
natural
bacterial
souring
drinkability
this
is
definitely
an
above
average
effort
from
an
under
appreciated
category
review
from
notes
taken
on
91009
quenching
and
refreshing
thats
for
sure
and
best
to
drink
it
on
the
colder
side
still
nothing
too
remarkable
here
but
it
delivers
what
its
supposed
to
moderate
carbonation
and
light
mouthfeel
make
this
a
very
freshing
beerespecially
after
a
hard
days
work
i
drank
this
from
the
bottle
and
smelling
inside
the
bottle
its
aroma
was
like
a
regular
dogfish
head
beer
so
i
was
quite
taken
back
by
my
first
taste
tasted
very
carbonated
even
though
it
didnt
have
a
carbonation
look
it
was
also
very
sour
and
tasted
more
like
a
wine
ive
never
described
my
beer
as
dry
before
but
that
is
just
the
word
for
this
beer
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
near
the
end
found
myself
getting
a
little
tired
of
the
sour
taste
still
a
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
and
would
be
great
with
something
grilled
or
marinated
its
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
serve
my
friends
who
prefer
winecocktails
over
beer
notes
a
common
mistake
ive
witnessed
a
few
times
with
this
is
expecting
or
demanding
it
to
be
something
that
it
is
not
for
instance
ive
seen
a
beer
staffer
at
a
wellknow
store
telling
another
customer
that
this
is
only
good
as
a
paint
stripper
and
better
stick
to
son
of
a
peach
as
a
fruit
ale
of
choice
different
beers
and
different
styles
this
is
quite
a
nice
brew
for
a
berlin
weissbier
and
purism
aside
if
one
thinks
of
the
hints
of
peach
it
is
actually
quite
true
to
style
nice
refreshing
tart
and
a
great
addition
to
seasonal
brew
offerings
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
d
its
a
different
kind
thats
for
sure
its
a
beer
that
one
wouldnt
randomly
pick
one
up
and
drink
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
different
this
is
certainly
different
not
a
terrible
beer
not
most
peoples
styles
though
i
feel
but
if
you
like
the
kind
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
an
interesting
change
of
pace
but
im
not
likely
to
purchase
again
theres
just
nothing
good
going
on
here
dfh
have
turned
a
beer
sour
but
theres
no
character
behind
it
just
an
overly
sweet
lactobomb
slightly
hazy
deep
straw
in
color
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
of
frozen
peach
ice
cream
and
lemon
zest
dominate
the
slight
aroma
this
beer
gives
off
taste
is
tart
and
to
the
point
this
is
just
as
you
expect
a
berliner
weiss
from
dfh
to
taste
not
up
there
with
the
greats
but
pretty
friggin
close
highly
drinkable
on
a
summer
day
although
too
many
and
the
sweetness
overpowers
no
need
for
syrup
in
this
bad
boy
tastes
quite
tart
with
a
lemon
zing
and
very
little
noticeable
wheat
after
a
decent
amount
of
time
the
wheat
and
yeast
become
slightly
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
i
am
honestly
not
really
getting
any
peach
on
this
at
all
which
is
somewhat
unfortunate
the
combination
of
lemon
juice
and
carbonation
hop
along
your
tongue
which
is
an
intriguing
mouthfeel
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
and
is
well
suited
for
the
summer
months
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
nose
has
subtle
peaches
tart
citrus
and
wheat
taste
also
has
a
nice
sour
yeast
presence
along
with
bready
malts
lemon
white
grapes
and
again
a
soft
peach
flavor
crisp
body
is
well
carbonated
very
refreshing
feel
this
ended
up
being
much
better
than
i
expected
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
ages
notes
this
is
an
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
dogfish
head
makes
offcentered
beer
for
offcentered
people
and
i
consider
myself
to
be
a
bit
offcentered
but
me
and
this
beer
must
be
on
opposite
sides
of
the
center
because
i
just
didnt
enjoy
it
all
that
much
ive
only
had
the
chance
to
try
a
couple
dfh
brews
with
60
minute
and
palo
santo
marron
being
my
favorites
i
gotta
give
them
respect
for
being
so
creative
and
quirky
as
it
takes
some
serious
balls
to
take
the
kind
of
risks
they
do
with
such
offthewall
beers
i
just
wasnt
feeling
this
little
quirky
creation
a
solid
dry
fruit
beer
the
tartness
not
overwhelming
a
refreshing
end
of
summer
quaff
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
white
head
it
is
a
hazy
pale
yellow
it
smells
kind
of
like
an
adjunct
lager
with
a
hint
of
peach
it
tastes
tart
it
reminds
me
of
green
apples
more
than
peach
it
is
dominated
by
the
tartness
i
could
probably
have
another
but
that
would
be
about
it
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
style
of
beer
to
try
it
again
notes
had
recently
missed
a
chance
to
catch
this
on
tap
a
few
months
ago
so
when
i
saw
the
bottle
i
snatched
it
up
i
wonder
if
it
would
have
presented
significantly
different
on
tap
more
investigation
may
be
required
again
here
i
very
much
appreciate
dfh
willingness
to
explore
lots
of
styles
and
even
create
seemingly
new
ones
at
times
d
like
i
said
very
refreshing
and
different
goes
down
easy
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
i
think
its
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
still
a
very
interesting
beer
that
proves
yet
again
that
dfh
is
always
willing
to
push
the
envelope
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
drinking
in
114
degree
az
sun
tart
but
not
overly
sour
mouthfeel
is
light
and
spritzy
and
fits
the
character
of
this
beer
the
best
it
can
drinkability
is
good
this
fits
only
a
hot
summer
day
its
refreshing
acidity
spritzy
mouthfeel
and
light
body
are
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
not
much
else
very
refreshing
but
i
feel
it
would
be
great
only
in
small
quantities
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
one
comment
from
a
taster
was
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
it
tastes
like
a
cocktail
i
give
it
pretty
high
marks
for
drinkability
wish
there
were
more
of
the
style
to
compare
it
to
d
a
very
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
poured
a
hazy
pale
straw
yellow
color
into
my
mason
jar
pint
glass
i
was
vacationing
in
a
cabin
and
these
were
the
glasses
du
jour
smelled
of
peaches
with
a
hint
of
sour
apple
pretty
tart
which
i
liked
but
there
really
wasnt
much
beer
taste
to
me
the
peach
was
more
of
a
background
flavor
i
actually
liked
the
acidy
tartness
that
lingered
after
each
drink
it
went
well
with
the
light
fizzy
mouthfeel
i
ordered
this
being
naive
to
the
peach
theme
because
i
dont
speak
the
french
and
am
a
bit
slow
on
the
uptick
mostly
just
wanted
a
lighter
beer
because
its
the
summer
its
hot
out
and
the
evening
was
just
getting
started
got
the
glass
it
looked
good
but
the
smell
was
fruity
and
strange
bheilman
devilish
man
that
he
is
then
filled
me
in
on
the
dirty
little
secret
peaches
my
friend
peaches
immediately
revulsion
filled
my
head
but
you
know
what
it
was
pretty
good
it
was
light
and
refreshing
and
had
a
fruit
taste
but
the
beer
part
of
this
beer
was
still
front
and
center
i
wont
run
back
to
get
this
but
i
enjoyed
it
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
hotter
the
day
the
better
or
the
cooler
basically
i
really
like
this
one
alot
and
find
it
tough
to
make
it
last
more
than
56
sipsgulps
every
time
i
have
one
recommended
other
i
was
really
let
down
by
this
beer
i
love
dfh
and
i
love
fruit
beers
but
something
about
the
style
or
flavor
just
wasnt
for
me
that
doesnt
mean
another
wont
like
it
but
i
dont
plan
on
ever
drinking
one
again
d
this
was
my
first
experience
with
the
style
i
must
say
that
it
was
just
above
average
on
a
tasting
scale
for
me
i
have
nothing
to
compare
this
beer
to
so
maybe
it
is
great
for
the
style
i
am
not
typically
into
sour
beers
but
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
id
like
to
check
out
a
few
more
of
this
style
first
though
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
perfumy
light
thin
and
dry
lemony
with
hints
of
peach
and
grapes
it
has
a
light
crackergrain
element
that
takes
over
in
the
aftertaste
overall
it
is
too
fruity
dry
and
thin
and
does
very
little
for
me
drinkability
is
real
good
since
the
alcohol
content
is
low
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
flavor
isnt
overpowering
you
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
get
too
tired
of
it
or
too
drunk
first
off
how
many
american
breweries
are
making
the
berlinerweiss
style
im
having
a
hard
time
coming
up
with
any
very
cool
in
my
opinion
that
dfh
would
even
try
to
attempt
a
beer
like
this
in
the
glass
this
bee
is
a
hazey
dul
hay
color
with
some
chunks
of
yeast
in
the
bottom
massive
foamy
head
rise
quick
and
falls
fast
signalling
high
carbonation
the
smell
is
yeasty
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
some
tropical
fruit
the
flavor
is
mostly
tart
slightly
lactic
and
nicely
flavored
by
the
peaches
most
fruit
beers
i
find
are
very
sweet
and
fruity
but
this
one
is
fairly
dry
and
very
well
done
i
could
not
put
this
beer
down
after
the
first
sip
quenching
and
quite
addictive
this
beer
was
ordered
at
the
local
old
chicago
when
it
first
came
to
the
table
the
roasted
golden
beer
had
a
good
deal
of
head
and
reduced
to
wisps
of
lacing
the
aroma
of
peaches
and
citrus
hits
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
surprise
as
it
is
a
tarter
beer
then
what
i
thought
that
they
peach
sugars
would
give
overall
a
good
change
within
the
summer
months
a
real
great
summer
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
light
alcohol
content
make
this
one
of
my
favorites
for
an
afternoon
barbeque
or
just
if
youre
lookin
for
something
light
d
havent
had
this
style
before
for
that
reason
a
bit
hard
to
judge
it
properly
dont
have
something
to
compare
it
against
and
not
entirely
sure
what
i
was
looking
for
in
the
taste
though
given
what
ive
read
about
the
style
it
seems
pretty
close
to
what
the
style
ought
to
be
overall
its
better
than
i
expected
more
sour
too
in
a
day
when
sours
are
all
the
rage
i
would
expect
this
one
to
do
better
on
ba
its
underrated
if
you
ask
me
great
beer
for
the
summer
i
enjoyed
it
on
a
gray
portland
or
afternoon
but
ill
remember
to
have
one
next
time
it
is
hot
a
tart
hefeweizen
steffie
cheldelin
i
love
this
beer
for
summer
it
strikes
a
good
balance
between
sweet
tart
and
drinkablility
between
festina
and
aprihop
im
a
happy
clam
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
the
quality
is
up
there
with
the
best
sour
beers
i
like
the
light
body
presented
here
as
well
as
the
playful
mouthfeel
and
bitter
fruitiness
dogfish
heads
brews
are
among
my
favorites
especially
their
crowdpleaser
indian
brown
however
the
festina
pêche
though
creative
and
quite
different
is
a
facescrunching
tart
experience
that
wont
be
revisited
i
wish
this
were
available
in
my
state
it
is
the
ultimate
summer
beer
im
not
sure
why
this
doesnt
get
higher
reviews
this
is
something
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
and
would
have
again
but
not
sure
how
soon
the
abv
makes
it
drinkable
but
i
havent
had
any
experience
with
tart
beers
at
all
so
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
multiple
initially
i
didnt
like
the
beer
but
after
i
took
a
few
more
sips
and
got
used
to
the
flavor
profiles
i
became
more
intrigued
and
kept
drinking
it
definitely
has
a
pretty
refreshing
aftertaste
and
feel
to
it
if
and
probably
when
i
try
some
again
i
would
like
to
do
so
in
the
middle
of
a
hot
afternoon
i
dont
really
know
what
to
think
here
i
believe
that
this
may
be
my
first
berliner
weiss
i
like
it
and
i
am
enjoying
it
i
would
like
it
again
i
just
dont
know
how
often
mmmmm
gets
a
solid
3
5
drinkable
overall
the
tartness
and
peach
flavors
are
done
very
well
this
beer
manages
to
avoid
overdoing
the
fruit
additions
which
cannot
be
said
for
many
worth
a
shot
drank
this
out
of
the
bottle
but
shared
this
with
a
friend
who
poured
it
into
a
glass
appearance
was
a
white
almost
pale
yellow
smell
was
a
burst
of
peachapple
with
a
hint
of
watermelon
nothing
faint
about
the
power
of
the
smell
almost
a
little
to
dominating
the
initial
first
taste
of
this
beer
is
a
trip
if
you
have
never
tried
it
before
it
reminds
me
of
some
type
of
a
sour
fruit
juice
you
get
a
sweet
sugar
peach
taste
mixed
with
a
sour
apple
backbone
quite
odd
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
any
point
from
start
to
finish
aftertaste
is
a
sour
tart
malt
that
doesnt
seem
to
linger
and
fades
quickly
mouthful
is
ok
if
your
into
sour
taste
but
may
not
be
enjoyable
for
those
who
arent
for
me
drinkability
would
be
ok
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
4
pack
in
a
session
though
overall
i
could
see
where
alot
of
people
would
think
this
to
be
way
to
sour
or
tart
however
being
that
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
the
rating
goes
up
higher
the
taste
vs
price
ratio
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
on
this
and
i
dont
think
i
will
be
buying
another
4
pack
anytime
soon
this
is
best
to
drink
when
really
cold
seems
a
little
funky
once
it
warms
up
pours
a
very
cloudly
light
pee
colored
yellow
with
a
two
finger
head
that
is
very
fizzy
not
very
creamy
and
disappears
rather
quickly
no
head
or
lacing
is
left
after
a
minute
just
some
fizz
around
the
very
outside
of
the
top
of
the
beer
small
carbonation
can
be
seen
slowly
rising
up
the
beer
in
the
glass
smells
of
malts
and
fruits
very
acidic
sour
fruits
peach
can
be
found
in
the
scent
too
the
taste
is
very
sour
of
fruits
acidic
ones
some
peach
can
be
found
once
the
sour
leaves
the
tongue
malty
aftertaste
on
this
one
definately
reminds
me
of
some
malt
liquor
i
have
had
in
the
past
kind
of
tastes
like
a
sour
kids
drink
or
something
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
heavier
than
water
with
good
carbonation
that
helps
balance
out
the
flavor
a
bit
still
cant
get
over
this
candy
sour
taste
drinkability
is
not
very
high
for
me
on
this
one
due
to
the
taste
the
sourness
tires
me
out
and
i
would
not
wanna
experience
it
too
often
no
other
tastes
in
the
beer
make
up
for
it
not
bad
not
great
i
would
rather
spend
the
cash
on
a
bottle
of
1809
this
beverage
really
does
have
its
place
and
time
summer
for
example
sharing
novel
beers
with
friends
might
be
an
ideal
such
setting
its
too
tart
to
pound
or
even
enjoy
regularly
but
its
such
a
unique
production
that
you
really
want
to
have
it
in
any
versatile
collection
typical
dogfish
excellence
this
time
on
the
weak
and
kinda
girly
side
of
the
spectrum
conclusion
beautiful
fruit
beer
drinkability
is
not
good
i
will
have
to
push
these
onto
someone
else
not
my
cup
of
tea
drinkability
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
like
this
but
i
could
only
have
1
or
2
at
the
most
d
while
the
abv
is
higher
than
it
should
be
for
the
style
i
can
still
drink
a
ton
of
this
and
have
at
certain
places
the
inconsistency
in
the
bottles
really
hurts
this
beers
average
imo
which
is
really
a
shame
since
this
is
probably
most
peoples
first
taste
of
the
style
nothing
beats
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
though
d
very
drinkable
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
side
rant
if
sam
adams
is
going
to
catch
hate
for
using
extracts
in
their
beer
instead
of
real
fruit
i
have
to
heap
some
on
dfh
as
well
a
little
bit
of
peach
in
a
wheat
beer
could
have
been
refreshing
and
enjoyable
instead
this
is
a
peach
bomb
that
i
cant
believe
made
it
out
of
the
brewpub
the
peach
is
neither
sweet
not
overbearing
and
i
like
that
just
rides
along
in
the
backseat
occasionally
reminding
you
that
its
there
taste
is
peachy
and
acidicly
sour
wonderful
tasting
beverage
i
think
the
year
in
the
cellar
did
this
beer
quite
well
refreshingly
tart
i
wish
there
were
more
berlinerweiss
beers
to
compare
to
but
it
compares
favorably
to
1809
although
weihenstephaners
version
is
better
i
am
enjoying
this
much
more
than
i
remember
last
year
when
i
had
it
fresh
if
you
like
sours
without
much
sweetness
give
this
one
a
try
drink
a
bit
too
sour
for
a
good
session
beer
hell
even
for
a
tasting
but
i
guess
it
is
worth
a
try
i
personally
find
the
dogfish
head
seasonals
to
be
the
weakest
part
of
their
overall
lineup
but
of
the
four
i
think
i
have
drank
this
one
the
most
as
it
really
is
a
nice
summer
refresher
not
complex
or
outstanding
by
anymeans
this
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
it
makes
me
want
to
try
more
of
this
particular
style
as
it
is
not
very
common
run
away
from
this
poor
effort
perhaps
it
takes
a
few
of
these
to
impress
it
upon
you
but
this
is
a
very
big
beer
in
terms
of
depth
and
flavor
and
purpose
there
is
very
little
sweetness
in
the
beer
it
is
boatloads
of
sour
tartness
with
malt
underlying
and
wheatiness
coming
in
for
the
finish
this
is
the
way
they
wanted
big
juicy
tart
refreshing
drinkable
complex
i
just
dont
get
the
negative
reviews
its
supposed
to
be
a
bit
thinner
than
you
are
used
tobut
the
tart
juice
creates
a
big
mouthfeel
its
supposed
to
be
low
alcohol
and
tart
and
to
me
that
makes
a
perfect
summer
seasonal
drinkability
is
great
very
fresh
and
perfectly
proportioned
this
light
easy
going
brew
has
the
perfect
amount
of
sourness
while
not
taking
away
from
its
other
qualities
all
this
comes
together
into
a
dangerously
drinkable
weiss
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
for
a
session
out
at
night
cheers
d
i
dont
believe
i
will
be
able
to
finish
off
the
rest
of
this
4pack
i
bought
easily
every
sip
i
take
is
one
of
regret
no
offense
to
the
brewery
it
is
something
different
however
its
not
a
favorite
of
mine
d
i
guess
if
i
enjoyed
it
more
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
light
and
watery
d
this
is
in
its
own
way
a
summer
refresher
it
would
be
good
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
when
just
hanging
out
with
friends
i
dont
mind
it
but
would
pick
something
else
if
i
had
the
chance
its
pretty
cool
that
dfh
makes
a
beer
in
the
berliner
weisse
style
and
add
a
little
something
to
make
it
more
drinkable
the
peach
juice
poure
kinda
hazy
and
orange
with
sediment
floating
in
the
bottom
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
sour
yet
fruity
with
is
very
right
for
the
style
i
liked
the
dry
tartness
that
follows
each
sip
the
peaches
are
really
only
there
to
balance
the
acidity
but
in
no
way
could
you
call
this
a
sweet
fruit
beer
very
refreshing
and
with
a
low
abv
very
much
the
apertif
for
the
patio
party
drinkability
is
high
cant
have
too
much
recommended
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
this
style
beer
but
it
doesnt
mean
i
dont
appriciate
it
it
was
very
much
enjoyed
a
very
interesting
beer
pours
like
a
macro
big
and
bubbly
peegolden
color
big
foamy
head
without
much
retention
like
a
champagne
macro
almost
no
insult
to
the
high
life
p
smells
like
tart
peach
like
a
jolly
rancher
thats
what
the
flavor
is
too
a
slightly
sweet
peachflavored
jolly
rancher
the
tartness
isnt
too
extreme
and
coats
the
mouth
nicely
very
light
and
airy
very
drinkable
for
the
summer
i
think
this
is
actually
spoiled
a
bit
for
me
as
at
acbf
i
tried
haverhills
berliner
weisse
and
it
just
blew
the
pants
off
of
this
one
though
especially
for
an
underrepresented
style
it
is
quite
nice
this
is
an
interesting
headturning
beer
from
dfh
would
you
expect
less
it
definitely
isnt
for
everyone
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
peaches
but
im
glad
for
their
presence
in
this
beer
because
they
added
some
sweetness
to
cut
through
the
decidedly
tart
edge
of
this
berliner
weiss
worth
trying
but
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
think
i
would
reach
for
first
or
purchase
regularly
dont
get
me
wrong
it
wasnt
a
bad
it
just
isnt
something
i
would
drink
regularly
maybe
have
one
occasionally
just
to
shake
things
up
which
is
exactly
what
dfh
did
pours
a
pale
yellow
very
carbonated
im
just
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
here
the
label
says
malt
beverage
with
peach
flavors
so
is
it
suppose
to
be
like
a
smirnoff
ice
or
more
like
a
fruit
beer
to
me
its
neither
has
a
very
watery
feel
taste
of
a
bad
sour
candy
not
really
any
peach
flavor
every
sip
is
very
mouth
puckering
i
suppose
some
may
like
this
flavor
it
could
be
ok
on
a
real
hot
day
but
overall
this
was
a
drainpour
for
me
notes
having
this
aged
is
an
experience
of
its
own
the
tartness
and
acidity
thin
out
over
time
and
produce
a
much
more
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
also
i
prefer
the
bottle
to
the
tap
it
felt
very
light
and
watery
in
the
mouth
but
i
suppose
if
you
can
get
over
the
taste
some
may
find
it
refreshing
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
the
beer
is
pretty
consistent
with
the
style
its
light
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
mouthfeel
it
seems
just
a
tad
thin
but
i
cant
fault
it
much
for
that
overall
this
beer
is
an
enjoyable
berliner
weiss
i
love
this
style
and
i
wish
that
more
breweries
would
produce
it
bone
white
in
color
irregular
pockmarked
head
of
mixed
bubble
sizes
dissipates
down
to
a
thin
layer
across
the
surface
with
virtually
no
lacing
prodigiously
cloudy
flat
yellow
color
fully
opaque
the
nose
is
comprised
of
bitter
grass
wheat
germ
white
mineral
dust
supersour
white
grapefruit
to
lemon
pith
barely
a
suggestion
of
peach
or
any
other
fruit
for
that
matter
wheres
waldo
wheres
the
malts
too
light
to
mediumbodied
however
so
sour
that
it
hardens
in
the
mouth
halfway
through
the
sip
close
to
bone
dry
as
a
result
retains
an
emphasis
on
the
desiccated
white
grapefruit
lemon
citrus
the
carbonation
is
finely
bubbled
and
has
a
mostly
upfront
prickle
once
more
have
to
ask
where
the
peach
flavor
is
at
best
its
like
sucking
on
a
peach
pit
from
yesterday
stony
pebbly
not
earthy
nor
minerally
just
sucking
on
stones
lots
of
wheat
raw
grains
and
grass
it
is
indeed
refreshing
but
if
served
blindly
you
would
not
come
close
to
guessing
what
it
is
labeled
as
body
is
light
and
this
is
very
drinkable
i
feel
as
though
this
beer
is
really
holding
back
on
the
sourness
for
the
style
the
peach
is
also
not
as
prominent
as
i
would
have
suspected
it
to
be
particularly
in
the
aroma
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
a
pleasant
lowgravity
surprise
from
dogfish
head
bought
a
12
ounce
bottle
as
part
of
a
mixasix
poured
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
light
straw
body
with
minimal
head
to
it
festina
peche
smells
tart
sweet
and
a
combination
of
apple
and
peach
in
my
opinion
upon
taking
a
sip
the
first
word
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
sour
i
do
enjoy
sour
beers
from
time
to
time
so
this
one
works
i
also
taste
some
of
that
peach
mentioned
in
the
beers
name
carbonation
is
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
tart
good
idea
to
have
a
glass
of
water
after
this
drinkability
is
decent
could
have
another
one
this
is
a
good
beer
and
would
most
certainly
be
a
big
step
in
the
right
direction
if
you
were
trying
to
ween
someone
off
drinking
a
hard
or
whatever
those
folks
at
bmc
put
out
with
some
sweetness
to
it
this
isnt
anything
amazing
but
it
is
a
pretty
solid
drinkable
beer
overall
if
youre
looking
for
an
interesting
take
on
a
fairly
difficult
to
find
style
id
say
go
for
it
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
what
it
was
but
think
that
on
the
whole
ill
stick
with
the
gueuze
when
looking
for
a
tart
thirst
quencher
bottle
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
head
fades
fairly
quickly
produces
decent
lacing
has
a
sour
fruity
aroma
has
a
decent
carbonation
the
flavor
is
on
the
sour
side
has
a
decent
lemon
peach
taste
to
it
has
a
dry
texture
like
a
tart
lemonade
a
light
body
the
finish
is
strong
and
tart
lingering
aftertaste
is
not
bad
if
there
is
a
fault
to
this
beer
its
that
it
doesnt
come
standard
in
six
ounce
flutes
both
hard
to
take
down
and
a
total
delight
this
is
a
cerebral
beer
that
lights
an
mri
orange
and
green
its
a
thoughtful
and
thoughtinducing
beer
that
tastes
like
decent
champagne
and
overmarinated
ceviche
tart
as
all
get
out
with
the
taste
of
granny
smith
apples
a
hint
of
coconut
and
yeah
peach
it
finishes
grainy
like
any
good
weiss
should
truth
is
its
likely
too
sour
for
most
anyone
reminiscent
of
tame
lambic
but
what
i
love
is
the
interaction
of
wheaty
malt
citrusy
hops
and
dry
white
peaches
you
dont
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
what
you
do
is
more
than
beer
its
a
message
maybe
even
propaganda
one
you
learn
from
accept
but
dont
have
the
freedom
to
question
i
love
a
nice
berliner
weiss
straight
or
with
syrup
and
this
one
is
pretty
good
it
is
quite
dry
and
not
as
crisp
or
balanced
as
i
would
want
for
such
a
low
abv
session
beer
this
should
scream
out
drink
another
but
it
doesnt
i
was
not
expecting
to
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
i
am
a
really
big
fan
of
dogfish
heads
brewery
and
most
of
their
beers
but
generally
i
am
not
into
really
fruitforward
beers
for
example
dfhs
black
and
blue
is
a
truly
wonderful
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
because
it
is
just
too
fruity
this
beer
is
not
a
onedimensional
peach
beer
it
is
instead
its
own
truly
complex
style
of
beer
i
am
not
reviewing
this
beer
while
i
drink
it
unfortunately
but
i
have
purchased
a
4
pack
of
these
3
of
the
past
4
nights
working
at
the
liquor
store
has
its
benefits
i
will
be
back
for
more
and
i
hope
that
no
one
else
gets
to
them
before
i
do
d
good
brew
i
would
drink
another
just
hoped
for
more
peach
bought
at
total
wine
more
in
glendale

fizz
and
fuzz

initially
poured
into
hotel

died
too
quickly
two
minutes
later

at

poolside
in
summer
sun
yeah
sure
why
not
do
it
again
maybe
but
have
others
that
prefer
in
similar
style
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
to
get
into
light
in
body
but
complex
in
flavour
it
would
make
a
great
summer
refresher
reminds
me
a
bit
of
kombucha
except
theres
booze
in
it
drinkability
a
nice
easy
drinking
sour
never
had
this
style
so
its
hard
to
compare
liked
it
though
d
ill
say
that
ive
never
had
a
berliner
weissbier
but
from
what
ive
read
this
is
right
on
the
money
i
thought
it
would
have
more
peach
presence
this
isnt
a
traditional
beer
but
i
didnt
really
mind
im
gonna
call
this
a
sipper
as
others
have
said
one
is
probably
enough
for
me
in
a
sitting
its
a
good
one
my
mouth
just
has
to
get
used
to
the
sour
very
interesting
d
at

this
beer
will
make
a
great
summer
refreshment
with
a
nice
amount
of
fruity
tartness
thatll
be
welcome
on
a
hot
day
i
loved
it
as
a
summer
sipper
but
nobody
else
i
have
forced
a
sip
upon
has
yetill
have
to
keep
trying
i
recommend
decent
beer
might
be
great
on
a
very
hot
day
seems
crisp
leaves
a
sour
aftertaste
that
makes
me
crave
for
water
a
bit
syrupy
where
to
start
piss
lemons
and
acid
this
is
a
terrible
beer
no
malt
backbone
and
taste
of
lemons
mixed
with
piss
no
head
and
a
total
lack
of
carbonation
i
have
sined
and
actually
poured
the
rest
of
it
down
the
drain
sorry
next
time
ill
pass
on
this
poor
choice
d
extremely
thirstquenching
and
very
easy
to
drink
although
the
abv
is
fairly
low
i
was
still
blown
away
by
how
refreshing
this
beer
was
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
made
for
drinking
on
a
warm
summers
day
or
evening
the
lemony
tartness
and
hints
of
peach
sweetness
refresh
without
cloying
given
the
abv
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
for
hours
i
liked
this
beer
so
much
when
i
first
sampled
it
that
i
bought
an
entire
case
on
the
spot
my
impressions
have
not
changed
and
this
beer
is
now
on
my
permanent
summer
to
buy
list
d
refreshing
yes
this
is
almost
has
nothing
in
it
that
tells
me
its
a
beer
its
like
alcoholic
fruit
juice
however
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
it
is
trying
to
be
and
i
salute
it
for
that
i
want
to
give
it
another
try
and
get
a
much
fresher
bottle
over
a
year
of
age
on
this
did
not
do
it
justice
drinkability
my
first
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
few
sours
i
have
tried
the
tartness
is
refreshing
without
being
overly
biting
nice
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
spring
seasonal
certainly
something
id
revisit
drinkability
very
sessionable
and
this
is
rare
for
me
to
say
that
about
any
of
dogfish
heads
concoctions
but
this
is
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
anytime
anywhere
the
sour
taste
might
bother
some
people
but
i
actually
think
it
makes
this
very
interesting
and
a
bit
out
of
the
box
like
the
rest
of
their
brews
i
can
definetley
see
having
this
one
on
the
beach
this
summer
for
sure
an
awesome
yet
strange
brew
that
must
be
tried
in
order
to
appreciate
props
to
dfh
for
keeping
things
unorthodox
as
usual
this
is
my
new
favorite
summer
seasonal
drinkability
light
crisp
refreshing
the
peach
isnt
overwhelming
and
it
balances
out
well
with
the
wheat
tartness
is
also
well
done
d
this
is
a
superb
warmweather
beer
low
enough
in
alcohol
to
be
a
perfect
session
beer
but
complex
and
tasty
enough
to
keep
you
interested
a
musttry
for
fans
of
the
style
fans
of
dogfish
head
or
someone
looking
for
a
unique
summer
brew
this
beer
is
not
for
everyone
it
is
sour
but
at
least
worth
a
try
d
very
tart
one
of
these
was
enough
for
me
its
oddly
refreshing
in
a
way
but
still
too
much
tartness
for
me
to
enjoy
not
my
favorite
from
dfh
d
this
is
a
quirky
little
beer
from
dogfish
head
quite
refreshing
on
a
summer
afternoon
i
enjoy
sour
flavors
peach
especially
so
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
definitely
worth
a
try
the
mouthfeel
is
again
a
perfect
balance
between
sweet
cloying
and
tart
sourness
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
excellent
beer
this
is
my
favorite
dfh
beer
overall
i
liked
this
version
of
a
berliner
weiss
though
i
could
not
have
more
than
one
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
fantastic
summer
beer
if
you
like
tart
and
sour
beers
be
sure
to
swirl
and
ad
the
yeast
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
to
the
glass
in
order
to
impart
the
yeast
complexity
and
to
temper
the
tartness
leave
out
the
dregs
for
a
cleaner
even
more
tart
version
pours
a
cloudy
orangishyellowish
color
quite
hazy
and
with
visible
carbonation
that
looks
like
seltzer
bublles
smells
a
bit
spicey
fruity
with
peach
obviously
a
bit
tart
and
yeasty
flavor
is
fruity
and
quite
tart
above
all
fairly
complex
actually
the
spiciness
and
tart
qualities
create
an
interesting
complexity
mouth
is
lightbodied
with
strong
carbonation
and
that
tartness
again
like
sweet
tarts
or
such
its
quite
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
quite
sessionale
as
long
as
you
like
tart
fruitiness
granted
i
had
a
one
year
old
bottle
but
this
beer
should
age
well
and
its
really
not
that
great
if
i
find
it
fresh
i
will
try
it
again
but
other
than
that
i
dont
expect
it
to
be
a
regular
for
me
wonderful
in
the
heat
this
is
simple
and
refreshing
low
alcohol
not
a

so
mouthpuckering

light

tart
that
is
what
i
wrote
before
knowing
what
a
berliner
weisse
beer
actually
was
in
a
sense
seamed
to
be
a
bit
over
carbonated
so
that
makes
this
beer
fairly
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
nice
representation
of
this

you

and
looks
like

personally
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
smells
similar
to
a
pilsener
the
first
sip
is
quite
tart
and
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
the
peaches
are
more
prominent
now
and
even
a
nice
turn
from
my
hefes
i
wish
the
peach
were
a
little
more
assertive
just
an
overpowering
lemon
flavor
the
feel
is
light
and
very
fizzy
the
sourness
drys
the
mouth
and
is
cloying
i
actually
contemplated
drinking
a
bud
to

these
flavors
this

this

beers
of
choice
clean
crisp

refreshing
o
love
this
style
right
now
this
one
isnt
bad
but
not
the
best
ive
had
however
it
was
much
cheaper
than
most
berliners
ive
had
its
soft
and
fluffy
on
the
tongue
but
not
exactly
crisp
the
acidity
hits
nicely
but
it
a
touch
brief
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
of
their
better
new
beers
surprised
ratings
are
so
low
on
this
one
a
little
simple
but
executed
well
and
refreshing
would
like
to
have
it
again
reminds
me
slightly
as
a
sour
gose
worth
checking
out
the
flavor
has
tangy
yeast
with
light
toasted
wheat
flavor
and
mild
acidity
in
the
feel
with
wheat
present
in
the
taste
with

lemony
juiciness
and
dry
taste
with
slight
tanginess
in

overall
a
pretty
easy

exceptional
but
decent

beer
in
general
terms
overall
a
tasty
rendition
of
the
style
clean
and
easy
take
just
tart
enough
typically
solid
ithaca
sour
o
a
bit
simple
but
very
refreshing
especially
with
the
low
alcohol
and
high
acidity
not
a
style
im
particular
fond
off
but
its
pretty
good
first
impressions
mild
cloudiness
to
the
eye
a
crisp
and
clean
slight
citrus
aroma
and
to
the
taste
a
well
balanced
wheat
with
a
level
of
sour
not
to
overpowering
and
flavor
hints
of
apple
lime
and
orange
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
you
can
drink
a
few
without
getting
overall
at
my
surprise
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
style
not
overly
impressed
with
the
mild

seems
like
its
awfully
light
and
mild
for
the
style
im
going
to
seek
out
this
style
to
compare
to
this
one
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
think
it
is
one
of
ithacas
better
beers
super
sessionable
it
tastes
like
a
good
pilsner
mixed
with
a
berliner
weiss
nice
light

refreshing
this
is
a

seems
to
be
kind
of
a
grainy
tone
to
things
though
the
sour
and
tart
seems
mild
and
is
in
no
way
abrasive
naturally
i
could
deal
with
a
sharper
amount
of
it
all
it
does
seem
to
be
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
up
aas
it
is
its
a
pretty
decent
example
of
the
style
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
a
nice
berliner
weisse
could
be
more
tart
and
sour
but
still
enjoyable
o
ok
mild
refreshing
not
a
ton
of
flavor
wouldnt
turn
it
down
wouldnt

it

on

nothing
really
stands
out
as
being

either
for
the
style
or
in

works
for

not
as

as
id

from
a

but
makes
for

damn
refreshing
beer
o
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
love
berliner
weisse
beers
and
wasa
excited
to
see
a
lowcost
prevalently
available
beer
of
this
style
unfortunately
it
just
didnt
hit
the
mark
significantly
less
carbonation
than
most
berliners
and
barely
any
sour
notes
tasted
like
a
fairly
plain
wheat
beer
standard
weisse
flavors
of
light
wheat
tangy
lacto
tartness
lemon
and
theres
some
more
added
phenolics
not
as
grassy
as
the
nose
but
those
herbaceous
qualities
are
there
thinbodied
with
a
good
combo
of
carbonation
rustle
and
esophagus
tartness
sting
more
acidic
feeling
than
it
is
sour
likeable
just
not
all
that
good
it
was
kind
of
boring
pours
a
clear
but
pale
straw
with
a
small
quickly
dissipating
head
looks
like
ginger
ale
just
what
im
craving
on
this
warm
sunny
day
smells
incredibly
fresh
and
clean
with
light
citrus
notes
especially
lemon
and
maybe
even
a
subtle
hint
of
the
ginger
ale
that
is
fitting
from
the
appearance
taste
is
not
what
i
would
expect
much
lighter
and
more
tart
theres
no
banana
or
clove
but
tons
of
citrus
ginger
lemongrass
along
with
green
apple
a
slightly
herbaceous
grassy
note
toward
the
end
with
long
smooth
tones
of
wheat
present
throughout
that
gets
more
pronounced
toward
the
end
the
finish
is
packed
with
wheat
with
the
lingering
taste
of
lemon
clean
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
typically
expect
from
a
weisse
but
welcomevery
light
crisp
and
refreshing
im
realizing
this
is
a
berliner
weisse
my
first
in
a
long
while
which
is
distinct
from
the
hefeweizens
most
hailing
from
southern
germany
such
as
the
area
around
munich
and
belgian
witbiers
upon
which
i
had
been
basing
my
expectations
perfect
summer
beer
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
like
mildly
dehydrated
piss
forming
an
eggshell
white
head
of
sodalike
bubbles
that
quickly
fizzle
to
a
scrim
in
body
the
beer
is
supremely
clean
and
clear
with
a
mellow
trickle
of
carbonation
bubbles
moving
through
the
beer
the
clarity
is
honestly
a
little
odd
for
the
style
where
is
all
the
wheat
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
tart
lemon
yogurt
and
granola
and
a
smooth
wheat
bread
smell
on
the
back
of
the
sniff
this
is
a
very
clean
and
crisp
smell
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
refreshingly
tart
with
a
balancing
bready
sweetness
that
moves
in
with
the
middle
of
the
sip
yet
the
finish
is
elegantly
dry
and
refined
there
might
be
a
touch
of
salinity
if
i
really
dig
into
the
flavors
but
really
this
beer
is
a
simple
tart
and
sweet
which
is
exactly
what
it
should
be
in
flavor
it
begins
as
tart
lemon
juice
which
moves
into
greek
yogurt
flavors
that
become
rich
with
just
a
touch
of
salinity
and
then
some
sweet
fruity
green
apple
the
finish
is
a
lovely
blend
of
wheat
dough
with
hints
of
wheat
flakes
and
just
a
touch
of
lemon
juice
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
in
body
with
a
crisp
effervescent
carbonation
a
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
tremendous
drinkability
when
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
wet
from
acidty
yet
clean
and
refreshed
making
this
beer
awesome
for
summer
thirst
quenching
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
an
excellent
sixpack
berliner
weisse
simple
flavors
mesh
together
for
just
enough
to
interest
the
sip
while
mouthfeel
makes
the
beer
very
crushable
this
is
a
great
day
drinker
and
would
probably
pair
very
well
with
a
syrup
if
you
go
that
way
this
is
a
great
sessioning
berliner
weisse
people
need
to
make
more
sixpack
berliners
pours
a
light
straw
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
a
fat
head
of
white
foam
looks
very
inviting
the
nose
is
citric
and
has
a
bit
of
lemon
on
it
also
has
a
delightful
bit
of
faint
cracker
its
a
touch
funky
but
not
too
much
taste
is
light
and
has
a
bit
of
cracker
on
the
tongue
the
fruit
is
tart
and
the
lactic
sourness
makes
you
pucker
a
bit
simple
refreshing
plentiful
and
active
carbonation
gives
it
s
sprtizy
feel
i
think
ithaca
has
made
a
wonderful
berliner
here
as
it
drinks
its
dry
and
even
a
touch
woody
very
simple
and
easy
to
drink
