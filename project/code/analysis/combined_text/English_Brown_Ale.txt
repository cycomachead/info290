the
color
is
a
beautiful
rubyamber
the
smell
has
strong
toasted
nut
aroma
and
after
an
initial
shockwave
on
the
tongue
it
mellows
out
and
balances
very
nicely
ales
are
not
typically
my
favorite
but
this
beer
is
unique
and
great
for
what
it
is
the
toasted
nut
flavor
on
the
aftertaste
is
quite
pleasant
i
think
this
beer
is
underrated
not
a
lot
of
head
but
it
has
a
deep
mahogany
color
you
can
smell
the
pecan
and
it
has
a
subtle
nutty
taste
im
a
fan
great
tasting
beer
very
unexpected
good
brown
ale
nothing
bad
to
say
i
would
recommend
a
touch
sweet
for
my
taste
but
still
pretty
good
def
worth
a
try
this
was
surprisingly
a
pretty
good
beer
really
smooth
nice
genuine
pecan
taste
id
recommend
a
very
good
brown
ale
with
a
subtle
pecan
flavor
this
was
a
one
sip
drain
pour
and
the
girlfriend
felt
the
same
way
i
cant
even
specifically
say
why
it
was
synergistically
bad
3
295
not
a
world
beater
but
very
approachable
and
easy
to
drink
this
glass
is
so
cold
i
may
over
rated
this
nice
pecan
taste
not
much
lacing
very
tasty
theres
nothing
bad
about
this
ale
but
it
doesnt
have
anything
that
will
make
me
come
back
for
more
theres
almost
no
pecan
taste
to
it
the
main
reason
anyone
would
initially
try
it
i
can
barely
smell
any
pecan
aroma
either
the
few
things
that
i
did
like
is
it
doesnt
linger
theres
almost
no
bitterness
and
its
got
a
good
color
id
take
newcastle
over
this
any
day
on
tap
pours
clear
light
brown
with
no
head
aromas
of
malt
nut
certainly
comes
through
on
the
flavor
with
smooth
sweet
malt
slight
pecan
aroma
very
light
pecan
taste
not
much
alcohol
but
smooth
and
tasty
looks
pretty
but
the
flavor
was
bland
and
too
sweet
god
damnit
jesus
made
this
beer
o
i
believe
you
should
give
it
a
try
very
smooth
wish
i
had
another
overall
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
nutty
brown
ale
that
has
a
nice
balanced
flavor
seems
pretty
underappreciated
on
here
though
i
did
have
it
on
tap
in
mississippi
smooth
ale
with
a
balanced
nutty
flavor
brewed
in
good
taste
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
possessing
good
if
subtle
flavors
of
nuttiness
malt
and
sweetness
all
nicely
balanced
but
not
pronounced
it
was
certainly
worth
a
try
and
id
certainly
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
i
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
on
my
own
overall
not
a
bad
beer
no
bitterness
but
theres
just
not
enough
nutty
flavor
to
market
this
as
a
pecanish
beer
it
was
drinkable
but
i
expected
much
more
flavor
didnt
give
what
the
label
said
no
pecan
in
smell
or
taste
ok
but
not
a
stand
out
in
anyway
didnt
really
do
much
for
me
no
aroma
tasted
like
a
regular
brown
ale
with
just
a
hint
of
pecan
pours
clear
copper
with
small
white
head
smells
of
pecan
malt
caramel
and
yeast
tastes
nutty
with
maltiness
and
slight
hops
average
mouthfeel
overall
below
what
i
had
hoped
for
but
not
bad
at
all
i
probably
wouldnt
spend
my
hard
earned
money
on
this
but
would
gladly
drink
one
anytime
definitely
notice
the
pecan
flavor
good
bit
of
malt
flavor
and
sweetness
for
the
low
abv
rather
tasty
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
session
brown
that
is
tasty
enough
to
enjoy
and
drink
all
night
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
light
in
body
but
the
pecan
and
brown
ale
flavors
are
very
pronounced
excellent
brew
nice
red
color
the
pecan
definitely
comes
through
gets
better
as
you
drink
it
but
it
should
be
better
what
a
disappointment
this
is
my
first
lazy
magnolia
beer
im
hoping
it
gets
better
just
a
solid
beer
in
any
weather
overall
very
drinkable
very
nutty
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
really
like
this
this
is
a
beer
great
for
people
who
love
beer
and
even
those
who
dont
sweet
but
not
syrupy
and
its
a
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
beer
perfect
to
have
when
firing
up
the
grill
in
the
summer
nothing
special
ok
english
brown
a
nice
pecan
nutty
flavor
in
a
milder
brown
ale
well
balanced
and
just
a
nice
little
beer
though
as
i
keep
drinking
this
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
overpronounced
its
like
a
cumulative
sweetness
it
lingers
in
my
mouth
and
every
sip
becomes
a
touch
sweeter
thats
disappointing
in
a
smaller
quantity
this
was
excellent
my
guess
is
the
low
hopping
means
theres
nothing
to
counteract
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
had
high
hopes
for
this
but
began
the
let
down
spiral
on
pour
not
much
head
at
all
even
with
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
no
lacing
to
speak
of
either
nose
was
nearly
nonexistent
save
for
a
whiff
of
toasted
malts
but
not
much
a
whiff
at
that
taste
was
at
best
boring
nothing
pecan
or
intriguing
about
this
at
all
even
that
which
made
it
a
brown
ale
was
not
really
good
body
was
thin
just
not
something
that
i
enjoyed
obviously
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a

smell
is

bready
taste
is
of
pecans
malts
mild

easy
drinking
feels
medium

in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
as
bitter
as
expected
lightly
sweet
not
very
hoppy

is
not

a
very
small

on
this
beer
that
has
very
few
hops
for

the
flavor
to
me
makes
this
beer
special
you
can
really
taste
the
pecans
with
a
very
nice
malty
flavor
has
some
yeast
and
very
little
bitterness
can
almost
taste
a
little
buttery
i
think
which
can
be
the
oils
from
the
pecans
gives
the
beer
a
nice
creaminess
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
light
one
of
the
first
beers
from
mississippi
i
have
ever
had
being
from
mississippi
this
is
by
far
the
most
common
local
beers
and
very
solid
choice
for
any
occasion
when
i
think
of
mississippi
this
is
the
beer
i
go
to
a
friend
brought
these
to
have
round
the
campfire
had
it
out
the
bottle
mild
smooth
and
pecany
usually
im
bored
by
browns
so
this
is
a
nice
alternative
would
have
again
overall
3
68
a
decent
beer
deserving
of
a
c
rating
theres
a
time
and
place
for
this
beer
but
id
certainly
have
it
again
overly
sweet
aroma
and
taste
this
beer
is
thinner
than
one
would
expect
for
the
sugary
content
small
head
but
decent
spots
for
lace
no
notable
hop
cloy
aftertaste
of
white
cane
sugar
thin
head
low
carbonation
sweet
finish
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
not
sure
what
to
say
about
this
beer
has
little
flavor
do
taste
and
smell
pecans
dark
brown
no
head
light
drinkable
but
nothing
memorable
no
hoppyness
or
bitterness
thought
it
was
bland
and
unfulfilling
just
there
no
bad
not
great
either
mouthfeel
light
body
but
slightly
gritty
this
a
smooth
lighter
tasting
brown
ale
taste
is
mildly
bitter
with
a
nutty
finish
pleasant
after
taste
lingers
and
you
really
pick
up
the
pecan
on
the
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
great
either
great
beer
overall
a
solid
allaround
brew
the
additions
of
pecan
do
well
to
add
a
distinct
pecan
flavor
so
thats
a
plus
overall
its
a
bit
lighter
than
what
i
like
in
a
brown
but
as
an
english
style
its
to
be
expected
id
likely
buy
it
again
if
i
ever
saw
it
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
or
making
a
trade
to
get
it
again
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
o
3
cloyingly
sweet
at
times
its
not
bad
but
nothing
i
would
get
again
overall
drinkability
sounded
like
a
very
promising
beer
but
by
the
end
i
feel
like
it
fell
short
like
a
pecan
soda
with
alcohol
in
it
i
dont
think
ill
have
again
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
good
one
and
i
like
pecans
oh
well
overall
a
very
pleasant
drinking
experience
it
is
quite
good
for
the
price
its
sold
at
in
nola
i
almost
always
have
a
bottle
somewhere
in
the
house
since
its
such
a
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
it
has
depth
and
complexity
but
not
to
the
extent
where
drinking
it
is
a
task
to
focus
on
cheers

overall
theres
no
doubt
about
it
you
have
to
like
a
nutty
flavor
to
like
this
beer
but
i
think
its
definitely
worth
a
try
excellent
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
a
good
break
from
some
standard
beers
it
has
a
sweet
taste
that
makes
it
a
very
good
dessert
beer
or
just
a
change
of
pace
from
some
others
im
typically
a
hoppy
beer
lover
but
this
one
surprised
me
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
permanent
fixture
in
my
fridge
but
it
is
a
welcome
visitor
nice
overall
beer
but
lack
the
advertised
pecan
taste
very
similar
to
other
nut
brown
ales
but
was
looking
for
the
pecan
to
be
a
difference
i
served
this
beverage
at
38
degrees
and
that
may
have
been
a
little
to
cold
so
i
will
try
it
later
this
week
at
42
degrees
to
see
if
the
pecan
flavor
stands
out
the
low
ibus
at
19
makes
this
beer
good
for
a
social
setting
because
their
is
not
bitter
hops
its
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
dont
think
the
sweetness
is
overpowering
but
rather
straightforwardly
brash
the
pecan
flavor
plays
into
the
novelty
and
so
does
the
fact
i
think
it
a
fitting
beer
for
a
saturday
matchup
between
ole
miss
and
auburn
pours
a
deep
amber
brownish
color
with
nice
clarity
a
bit
on
the
reddish
side
for
a
brown
ale
no
head
at
all
present
the
nose
starts
with
some
brown
bread
oatmeal
and
light
nutty
notes
not
sure
that
i
would
pick
the
nuttiness
out
as
pecan
but
there
is
definitely
some
influence
from
the
adjuncts
taste
is
watery
with
nutty
notes
and
hints
of
grain
no
hops
noted
in
the
flavor
but
some
bitterness
at
the
finish
makes
for
an
unpleasant
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
low
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
not
well
executed
it
tastes
like
a
really
light
watery
beer
with
some
adjunct
flavors
added
would
not
return
to
this
beer
overall
an
easy
drinking
nut
brown
ale
that
is
pretty
average
nothing
really
outstanding
but
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
the
dry
and
powdery
aspects
build
up
a
little
to
ease
off
the
strong
sweetness
in
the
middle
of
every
sip
and
makes
for
a
much
more
pleasurable
finish
than
it
seems
destined
to
have
in
its
medium
body
i
must
say
that
you
have
to
try
the
tap
if
you
are
going
to
rate
this
beer
i
had
bottled
first
and
was
disappointed
it
seemed
like
another
lazy
porter
at
best
i
was
reluctant
to
try
it
at
a
gulfport
pizza
joint
but
since
it
was
on
tap
there
i
went
for
it
it
seems
to
be
popular
in
the
area
and
i
wanted
to
give
it
proper
test
and
was
i
pleased
this
beer
is
so
good
on
tap
the
pecan
really
shines
in
this
nutty
ale
another
party
at
the
table
said
they
had
had
it
before
and
was
unimpressed
so
i
told
them
my
experience
they
decided
to
try
it
on
tap
here
and
they
agreed
that
it
was
decisively
better
onice
nutty
brown
ale
id
gladly
drink
more
of
this
one
o
not
bad
but
not
my
normal
cup
of
tea
either
probably
will
not
attempt
again
unless
free
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
nutty
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
in
the
taste
light
nuttiness
sweet
dough
light
herbal
hop
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
with
pecan
in
the
finish
light
bodied
a
little
watery
but
easily
drinkable
and
good
flavor
this
is
a
good
ale
and
holds
up
nicely
in
the
warm
weather
poured
from
355
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted

overall
a
very
nice
session
ale
and
delicious
on
a
pleasantly
cool
fall
day
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
special
but
worth
a
try
the
sharpacidic
bite
is
offputting
but
great
depth
of
nutty
flavor
truly
a
unique
beer
a
hint
of
diacetyl
in
the
aftertaste
drives
the
nutty
presence
home
overall
a
reasonable
brown
ale
not
my
goto
style
for
sure
would
like
more
some
pecan
in
the
taste
pours
a
brilliant
mahogany
brown
with
a
1inch
tan
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
settling
in
at
116th
inch
caramel
with
hints
of
roasted
nuts
and
restrained
malt
in
the
nose
with
an
eversoslight
sour
note
mediumlight
body
with
suggestions
of
cocoa
and
toasted
bread
very
little
hops
expecting
more
pecan
on
the
palate
slight
pleasant
lingering
with
restrained
but
balanced
malt
and
hop
notes
no
belgian
lace
nice
brown
ale
unfortunately
it
is
not
as
moreish
as
would
be
expected
of
a
brown
ale
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
i
guess
thats
all
that
truly
matters
as
the
other
parameters
seemed
weak
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
overall
i
liked
it
but
not
in
my
regular
rotation
wouldnt
turn
it
down
at
all
great
introduction
beer
this
is
a
shame
because
i
did
really
like
this
beer
also
had
on
tap
recently
so
this
review
is
sort
of
a
review
of
both
although
the
final
review
is
from
a
bottle
i
had
this
at
the
atlanta
airport
pours
light
brown
with
white
head
taste
is
nutty
earthy
nose
has
some
brown
sugar
root
beer
bread
crust
but
artificially
sweet
flavor
is
the
same
frankly
artificially
sweet
brown
sugar
root
beer
root
veg
sweet
finish
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
nut
brown
type
flavor
however
i
thought
this
was
not
good
i
would
not
drink
this
again
overall
the
style
is
a
bit
boring
to
me
and
this
one
is
about
par
for
the
course
i
dont
like
pecans
so
initially
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
but
this
beer
is
really
good
its
almost
dessertlike
also
the
couple
that
started
the
brewery
are
the
perfect
combination
for
this
business
one
is
an
electric
engineer
and
the
other
is
a
chemical
engineer
overall
for
my
first
pecan
infused
beer
lazy
magnolia
delivers
the
right
roasted
nut
and
malt
flavour
very
enjoyable
beer
with
all
the
right
elements
o
an
ok
beer
its
not
bad
just
nothing
special
i
was
really
looking
foward
to
trying
this
beer
but
was
dissappointed
on
a
positive
note
one
could
definately
put
back
seera
lof
these
in
one
session
overall
a
decent
beer
overall
not
particularly
flavorful
or
aromatic
but
definitely
smooth
and
easy
drinking
it
is
refreshing
to
have
a
beer
everyone
once
in
a
while
that
doesnt
punish
your
palate
or
blow
your
mind
this
one
is
just
that
nothing
wrong
with
it
nice
bready
notes
and
pecan
hints
and
a
little
residual
sweetness
bottle
appearance
redish
brown
aroma
some
malt
very
faint
nut
taste
slightly
sweet
palate
light
body
somewhat
flat
has
a
slightly
sweet
finish
overall
i
dont
pick
up
the
pecans
at
all
and
it
ends
up
being
a
fairly
nondescript
sweetish
brown
ale
o
while
its
not
necessarily
an
unpleasant
beer
its
just
not
worth
drinking
when
there
are
so
many
better
options
out
there
purchased
from
the
total
wine
store
in
pembroke
pines
fl
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
chestnut
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
sweet
pecans
and
caramel
and
the
taste
is
also
of
sugar
coated
pecans
a
very
malt
forward
brew
here
overall
not
a
bad
offering
from
lazy
magnolia
cant
see
myself
ever
drinking
this
again
o
to
be
honest
i
think
its
good
not
great
this
is
a
really
sweet
beer
so
if
youre
not
into
sweet
beers
stay
away
sweet
malt
and
carbonation
dominate
this
beer
i
think
id
like
it
a
little
more
if
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
less
carbonated
not
bad
though
an
alright
pub
beer
theres
a
degree
of
originality
in
the
sweetness
and
oilyness
but
its
a
bit
uneventfulflat
for
me
and
i
just
dont
care
for
the
taste
i
actually
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
wish
it
wasnt
1500
miles
between
me
and
another
one
thanks
to
metter98
and
his
parents
for
bringing
this
one
back
to
ny
for
me
o
overall
yah
get
no
pecans
here
and
that
metallic
tinge
to
it
not
a
fan
lastly
like
some
beers
i
have
tasted
before
there
is
a
distinct
metallic
taste
to
this
beer
another
mark
against
it
o
a
fantastically
balanced
brown
ale
there
is
nothing
overpowering
or
understated
it
all
works
together
ive
been
waiting
to
try
a
lazy
magnolia
offering
and
im
impressed
cheers
overall
it
was
good
and
paired
well
with
salty
tortilla
chips
its
a
good
casual
snack
beer
but
not
much
else
overall
nutty
flavors
are
the
highlight
so
much
that
its
the
only
flavor
really
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
dissipates
in
a
matter
of
seconds
with
a
smell
of
wheat
barley
minimal
to
no
pecan
smell
flavor
reminded
me
a
lot
of
sam
adams
boston
lager
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
but
barely
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
this
an
ale
because
it
tasted
so
much
like
a
lager
an
overall
good
and
safe
beer
to
have
however
i
was
expecting
more
than
safe
but
rather
an
unusual
hint
of
pecan
since
i
havent
had
pecanbrewed
beer
before
tasted
like
many
other
good
lagers
not
ales
ive
had
before
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
dark
amber
the
beer
poured
a
small
head
that
was
gone
pretty
fast
the
beer
did
have
killer
lacing
though
a
nice
caramel
smell
oozed
from
the
tumbler
and
when
i
took
that
first
hit
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
nice
sweet
hit
but
not
overbearing
sorta
like
a
handful
of
kracker
jacks
i
reall
did
not
get
much
of
a
pecan
taste
but
that
might
be
a
good
thing
i
liked
this
one
and
would
buy
again
o
this
is
a
damn
tasty
nut
brown
ale
id
put
it
right
up
there
with
sam
smiths
this
poured
out
as
a
much
lighter
color
than
i
expected
its
a
light
brown
basically
a
deep
orange
there
is
a
decent
looking
tan
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
roasted
and
has
a
subtle
nuttiness
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
very
gentle
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
lighter
bodied
and
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
brew
would
recommend
for
fans
of
the
style
this
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
beige
head
not
really
getting
much
for
pecans
in
the
aroma
just
a
mild
scent
of
malts
the
taste
is
mellow
and
slightly
sweet
not
at
all
complex
this
is
a
simple
nut
brown
ale
actually
if
it
wasnt
for
the
label
i
would
have
never
guess
there
were
pecans
in
the
beer
it
finishes
very
smooth
and
clean
overall
on
of
my
southern
favorites
very
happy
to
have
gotten
this
on
a
trade
to
enjoy
again
pours
clear
dark
amberlight
caramel
with
mimimal
offwhite
head
nose
is
filled
w
sweet
caramel
vanilla
banana
clove
malts
it
smells
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
it
aint
christmas
afterall
surprised
by
the
taste
which
is
better
than
i
would
have
expected
minimal
bitterness
clean
crisp
on
the
front
which
fades
to
caramel
malts
fortunately
all
of
that
aroma
isnt
indicative
of
the
taste
usually
the
english
style
is
a
bit
too
bitter
harsh
for
me
but
this
is
very
drinkable
carbonation
mouthfeel
are
on
the
mark
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
in
this
beer
and
regardless
it
isnt
very
good
i
have
no
need
to
finish
my
bottle
regardless
of
what
i
think
about
this
beer
i
am
very
thankful
to
finally
try
it
thanks
mindy
for
the
bottle
ive
now
tried
and
reviewed
a
beer
from
mississippi
49
states
sampled
i
need
to
try
a
beer
from
north
dakota
o
not
much
going
on
in
the
beer
the
pecan
flavor
is
nice
but
thats
about
it
o
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
nut
brown
ale
with
a
nice
little
twist
of
pecans
it
might
have
been
nicer
if
it
wasnt
as
sweet
and
had
more
nutty
flavors
this
might
be
a
better
dessert
type
beer
aroma
and
appearance
werent
as
good
as
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
for
me
decent
beer
with
some
light
flavors
but
in
the
end
it
was
an
easy
drinking
beer
o
all
around
a
good
brown
ale
would
have
this
again
overall
nothing
too
special
about
this
one
probably
wont
try
again
possibly
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
the
state
of
mississippi
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
brown
ale
either
maybe
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
it
pours
real
light
brown
in
color
but
its
more
tan
or
bronze
in
color
because
of
its
radiance
and
the
penetrating
light
theres
a
nice
slowly
fading
lace
head
on
top
the
nose
is
quite
nutty
but
also
lighter
on
the
malt
roast
than
i
expect
in
a
brown
ale
no
yeast
or
hops
to
speak
of
at
all
but
i
do
smell
what
must
be
the
pecans
and
they
are
sweet
and
woody
the
flavor
is
equally
light
with
the
pecans
really
beign
featured
a
lot
more
than
the
abita
version
which
is
the
only
other
pecan
beer
ive
had
i
like
that
this
isnt
spiced
at
all
just
flavored
with
the
nuts
which
are
tasted
more
on
the
back
end
of
the
trip
really
light
in
body
id
say
too
much
so
but
in
the
context
of
a
steamy
mississipps
swamp
or
somethiing
sorry
for
the
stereotype
i
think
its
lightness
would
be
a
pro
rather
than
a
con
which
it
was
in
a
denver
january
smooth
feel
though
relaxed
carbonation
and
overall
a
beer
and
a
brewery
id
really
like
to
drink
more
of
who
knew
o
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
relax
with
on
a
warm
florida
afternoon
i
could
have
two
or
three
of
this
beer
without
getting
tired
of
it
it
has
just
enough
of
a
twist
to
make
it
different
from
your
typical
brown
ale
brownishdark
amber
pour
small
offwhite
head
sank
to
a
ringlet
leaving
just
a
few
spots
behind
on
the
glass
malty
nose
toasty
bready
nutty
simple
but
nonoffensive
taste
was
similar
bready
malts
hinting
towards
caramel
toasted
nuttiness
light
notes
of
yeast
and
fruit
rinds
body
was
about
medium
kind
of
lagerish
not
great
but
pretty
easily
drinkable
overall
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
will
definitely
try
again
enjoyed
the
pecan
tastesmell
good
beer
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
and
fairly
enjoyable
overall
not
really
as
nut
forward
as
i
was
hoping
for
or
expecting
in
either
the
flavor
or
the
aroma
the
fruity
english
yeast
aspects
really
came
out
here
and
elevated
the
candy
sweet
malt
base
almost
too
a
fault
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
toasted
nut
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
fairly
mild
and
drinkable
edit
while
i
have
been
reading
others
reviews
of
this
beer
i
have
been
savoring
the
aftertaste
from
the
one
i
had
been
drinking
while
reviewing
the
aftertaste
may
be
the
best
ive
ever
had
in
a
beer
for
that
reason
im
bumping
up
my
rating
and
opening
up
another
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
for
reviewing
purposes
offwhite
head
low
to
moderate
retention
on
a
mahogany
body
looks
almost
like
an
amber
more
than
a
brown
lacing
is
soapy
and
slides
down
the
glass
aroma
includes
caramel
malts
some
nuttiness
i
suppose
and
a
slight
roast
taste
is
caramel
maltiness
slightly
sweet
again
with
a
slight
nuttiness
and
roast
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
as
expected
after
viewing
the
beer
not
jam
packed
with
flavor
but
nothing
offputting
and
very
agreeable
to
the
average
person
lightish
body
with
medium
high
assertive
carbonation
that
robs
the
beer
of
any
smoothness
or
creaminess
i
enjoy
in
the
better
brown
ales
falls
a
little
on
the
watery
side
ultimately
unsatisfying
not
terrible
but
totally
unexceptional
o
this
beer
could
have
been
decent
but
comes
off
as
mediocre
and
forgettable
not
nearly
as
well
made
as
holy
citys
pecan
dream
the
sweetness
is
initially
cloying
and
rather
simple
in
nature
some
obvious
nutty
and
grainy
notes
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
thicker
in
texture
than
most
from
this
style
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
improve
the
drinkability
certainly
interesting
maybe
even
unique
but
not
very
good
from
a
session
drinking
perspective
craft
brew
still
in
its
infancy
in
mississippi
served
from
growler
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
pecan
slight
roasted
malt
and
bread
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
pecan
roasted
malt
subtle
milk
chocolate
and
bread
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
the
pecan
aspect
of
the
one
really
managed
to
carry
through
which
is
surprising
due
to
the
intensity
of
them
this
really
made
the
brew
enjoyable
on
my
palate
as
im
a
huge
fan
of
them
the
aroma
wasnt
quite
as
great
as
it
was
kind
of
hard
to
pick
up
on
just
about
anything
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
again
in
a
different
format
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
a
mixed
feeling
for
this
english
nut
brown
ale
good
or
bad
depends
popped
this
bottle
open
cold
into
a
glass
and
gave
it
time
to
breathe
first
taste
i
was
expecting
pecans
but
was
presented
with
an
overly
sweet
caramel
syrup
that
put
me
off
nevertheless
this
quickly
fades
away
to
a
mild
nutty
taste
and
nice
smooth
finish
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
specialty
style
brown
ale
that
should
be
tried
at
least
once
odliked
it
once
either
way
i
was
happy
to
try
it
consistency
is
key
this
beer
seems
pretty
inconsistant
this
is
my
third
time
to
taste
this
beer
and
i
have
to
say
it
is
probably
the
worst
of
the
three
times
i
must
preface
that
this
was
bottled
10
months
ago
and
although
that
may
have
been
a
part
of
why
it
didnt
fare
well
even
with
the
others
doing
the
tasting
tonight
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
mild
contamination
it
seemed
to
have
a
metalic
aftertaste
like
the
ph
spiked
please
dont
judge
this
beer
by
this
review
because
i
have
enjoyed
it
in
the
past
but
this
batch
was
definitely
not
what
lazy
magnolia
should
be
proud
of
light
brown
color
which
was
lighter
than
expected
very
little
head
and
poor
retention
seemed
far
too
highly
carbed
mettalic
finish
which
suggests
some
sort
of
contamination
to
me
or
a
high
ph
kind
of
issue
with
the
beer
then
i
checked
the
bottle
and
it
was
dated
december
since
it
is
october
now
this
must
be
a
distribution
problem
or
some
organization
issue
within
the
brewery
itself
as
the
store
i
purchased
the
beer
from
is
less
than
a
month
old
solid
beer
really
enjoyed
the
nuttiness
very
enjoyable
english
brown
ale
odliked
it
once
hated
it
the
second
time
maybe
the
second
keg
was
screwy
either
way
i
was
happy
to
try
it
but
would
probably
avoid
it
if
i
ever
saw
it
again
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
and
it
turned
out
a
bit
flat
on
draft
at
vellos
in
gainesville
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
aroma
is
slight
nut
maybe
a
little
grain
and
some
skunkiness
unfortunately
thin
mouthfeel
a
little
watery
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
flavor
is
lacking
with
watered
down
grains
no
sweetness
and
a
finish
that
is
a
bit
unpleasant
i
wouldnt
go
after
this
again
maybe
worth
a
try
once
for
the
mississippi
tick
overall
nice
for
a
pint
or
too
but
could
get
cloying
after
a
few
o
an
interesting
concept
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
a
bit
stronger
everything
seems
a
bit
contained
this
would
serve
as
a
pretty
good
dessert
beer
as
it
is
very
sweet
it
overpowers
the
nuttiness
a
bit
this
beer
pours
an
absolutely
beautiful
deep
deep
amber
with
a
fluffy
1
12
finger
head
leaving
extensive
lacing
the
smell
was
very
citrus
and
i
did
detect
some
nuttiness
but
it
was
buried
beneath
the
fruit
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
but
nothing
special
the
taste
was
very
average
i
expected
more
nuttiness
since
this
beer
was
brewed
with
pecans
but
i
mostly
tasted
sweet
malt
with
grapefruit
signatures
and
some
hops
worth
a
taste
but
nothing
too
special
taste
isnt
much
better
as
english
yeast
imparts
its
typically
dry
profile
over
the
subpar
malt
base
some
nuttiness
creeps
in
to
impart
a
small
amount
of
alternate
flavor
but
nothing
can
save
this
from
mediocrity
not
worth
your
money
o
not
too
bad
but
a
little
more
malt
character
would
help
this
out
a
lot
still
an
interesting
beer
overall
i
really
like
this
brown
ale
i
think
the
pecans
are
a
nice
touch
i
just
wish
it
were
a
littttle
more
fullbodied
although
it
definitely
comes
as
advertised
this
beer
was
not
for
me
body
is
weak
almost
watery
with
a
decent
carbonation
load
some
albeit
slight
warming
this
is
their
first
recipe
and
should
be
revisited
revamped
or
recycled
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
amber
with
a
tall
biege
head
that
dissipates
quickly
lacing
is
not
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
the
head
dissipates
there
are
roasted
malts
and
pecans
in
the
aroma
the
nutty
smell
is
prominent
and
theres
a
mild
sweetness
as
well
sweet
bready
malts
and
pecans
come
through
in
the
taste
there
are
some
hops
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
is
also
quite
clean
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
low
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
smooth
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
and
refreshing
beer
flavor
is
crisp
and
juicy
with
english
yeast
esters
and
toffeenutty
maltiness
still
not
getting
much
pecan
per
say
but
for
the
style
this
is
highly
quaffable
thin
body
medium
carbonation
with
fine
bubbles
southern
pecan
is
an
easy
drinker
but
i
dont
get
much
pecan
they
should
take
a
line
from
512s
pecan
porter
and
crank
that
flavor
up
o
an
interesting
beer
but
it
doesnt
live
up
for
the
name
i
didnt
get
any
pecan
flavor
or
aroma
just
a
common
brown
ale
give
it
a
try
3
485
00
rjt
this
was
a
decent
beer
i
thought
the
brown
sugar
was
a
little
too
much
though
overall
its
decent
and
an
interesting
concept
i
feel
though
that
the
beer
needs
a
stronger
more
robust
body
to
support
the
pecan
more
roasted
malt
might
work
perhaps
even
some
chocolate
malts
now
the
beer
remains
a
curiosity
it
was
nice
to
try
it
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
it
taste
i
gave
just
above
average
because
of
its
uniqueness
it
tastes
of
that
macro
style
malt
we
all
love
but
i
do
taste
the
pecans
well
its
closer
to
roasted
peanuts
to
me
either
way
its
different
and
1
on
that
overall
drinkable
but
no
award
winning
brew
for
me
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
nuttiness
is
appreciable
and
a
nice
difference
maker
for
this
beer
overall
not
a
bad
brown
ale
but
ive
certainly
had
better
i
might
give
it
another
shot
soon
and
hope
that
i
just
grabbed
a
bad
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
mediumbodied
it
thickens
up
pretty
good
if
you
swish
it
around
your
mouth
very
sweet
no
dryness
here
overall
this
brown
ale
is
pretty
meh
to
me
despite
its
fairly
unique
quantity
of
nut
flavor
a
true
nut
brown
ale
but
lacking
in
depth
and
character
in
spite
of
its
innovations

pint
glass
that
i

is
a
clear

just
a

ruby
topped
with
spongy
rocky
light
brown
head
that
devolves
into
a
nice
longlasting
film
leaving
moderate
lacing
smells
and
tastes
perhaps
a
little
estery
it
could
be
that
this
is
related
to
the
vanilla
or
green
apples
others
have
noticed
although
id
say
more
akin
to
bananas
caramel
is
the
main
aroma
english
hops
present
as
well
the
taste
i
like
better
nutty
and
crackery
grains
at
first
but
tart
and
fruity
again
banana
as
well
as
faintly
black
peppery
as
it
settles
with
nuttiness
and
hops
strongest
on
the
aftertaste
accentuated
by
the
warming
the
dark
chocolate
that
others
have
noticed
i
think
can
be
parsed
out
to
these
other
tastes
although
it
is
definitely
present
this
ones
a
smooth
medium
bodied
rich
moderately
carbonated
only
mildly
astringent
brew
not
overwhelming
on
the
palate
despite
its
cornucopia
of
flavors
and
sensations
so
i
could
easily
drink
the
whole
pint
and
more
in
one
sitting
although
i
chose
to
save
what
wouldnt
fit
into
my
first
pour
for
later
good
smooth
taste
and
very
mellow
but
too
expensive
o
the
vanilla
caught
me
by
surprise
i
like
the
vanilla
but
it
doesnt
really
match
the
style
very
subtle
but
wonderful
taste
i
want
a
barrel
the
nuttiness
is
too
pronounced
for
my
taste
it
was
ok
nothing
special
overall
this
is
light
drinkable
brew
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
engaged
its
missing
the
nuttier
flavors
i
normally
find
in
a
brown
ale
but
that
doesnt
diminish
its
quality
any
mild
coffee
caramel
toffee
malt
then
a
sweet
brown
sugar
that
throws
off
the
balance
overall
at
only
5
alcohol
there
is
a
ton
of
flavor
packed
into
this
beer
really
nice
complexities
in
the
malt
ranging
from
sweet
caramel
nuttiness
and
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
from
a
roasted
malt
the
earthy
hops
add
a
nice
balance
but
almost
add
a
bit
too
much
spice
in
the
finish
also
relatively
speaking
this
was
surprisingly
bitter
especially
at
first
but
that
fades
a
little
with
warmth
overall
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
and
one
that
will
a
go
to
for
the
style
when
i
want
a
brown
ale
a
smooth
nutty
taste
this
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
biers
its
a
good
transition
beer
this
is
what
an
english
brown
ale
is
supposed
to
be
pours
dark
brown
with
a
2
12
finger
head
that
does
not
hold
long
nutty
and
flavorful
ive
rated
ca
650
beers
of
all
types
and
this
is
one
of
the
most
overrated
ive
tried
overall
i
love
to
have
this
beer
in
winter
and
watching
the
end
of
this
winter
classic
hockey
game
makes
it
perfect
booyah
overall
a
world
class
beer
for
sure
perhaps
the
standard
by
which
all
other
english
style
nut
browns
should
be
judged
nutty
toasty
slightly
sweet
malt
with
specialty
malt
fruitiness

overall
good

not

come

dark

nice

this

an
exceptional

with
the
perfect

will
always
come

to

exceptionally
long

throughout
brown
colored

exactly
like
the

the
toffee
notes
are
the
focal
point
a
little
hint
of
caramel
perhaps
a
little
hazelnut
like
nutella
very
easy
to
drink
no
one
flavor
overwhelms
the
palette
light
bodied
with
a
gentle
hop
kick
not
thick
at
all
which
is
remarkable
surprisingly
refreshing
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
ill
definitely
revisit
i
would
say
i
really
agree
with
the
overall
ratings
this
one
has
gotten
from
this
site
another
delicious
beer
from
sam
smith
finish
hoppy
at
first
with
a
lingering
malty
roastiness
still
coats
the
mouth
after
5
minutes
between
sips
this
is
a
contemplative
beer
meant
for
enjoyment
with
friends
and
exciting
food
with
lots
of
flavor
and
spice
o
i
went
in
with
a
completely
open
mind
on
this
one
and
am
glad
i
did
this
brew
is
more
for
research
purposes
anyways
as
i
am
planning
on
brewing
a
similar
style
of
brown
ale
but
with
a
hint
of
peatsmoked
malt
thrown
in
i
think
the
peat
would
go
well
with
this
one
though
very
good
brew
food
match
stilton
cheese
game
such
as
roast
grouse
pheasant
partridge
roast
duck
and
guinea
fowl
yeah
i
read
from
the
label
again
my
first
english
brown
ale
i
found
it
only
vaguely
comparable
to
various
american
brown
ales
ive
had
while
not
partial
to
brown
ales
i
was
very
fond
of
rogues
hazelnut
brown
and
dfhs
indian
brown
ales
and
while
you
would
never
confuse
this
with
them
i
would
consider
it
on
par
this
is
the
blueprint
for
brown
ales
and
i
can
see
why
overall
i
expected
it
to
be
darker
and
sweeter
but
still
a
great
brown
ale
poured
a
wonderful
brown
color
with
amber
around
the
edges
when
held
to
light
and
a
two
fingers
of
gorgeous
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
receded
leaving
abundant
lacing
it
looks
fantastic
scents
of
sweet
malt
rich
yeasty
fresh
bread
caramel
alongside
some
hints
of
toffee
and
nuttiness
a
very
appealing
rich
maltdominated
aroma
that
is
still
quite
light
very
nicely
executed
and
extremely
true
to
style
flavor
begins
with
toasted
malt
and
slight
caramel
flavors
alongside
a
mediumlight
malt
sweetness
and
light
bitterness
moving
into
a
nutty
toasted
biscuity
malt
flavor
with
moderate
bitterness
and
hints
of
toffee
finish
is
semidry
with
notes
of
toasted
malt
nutty
flavors
toffee
and
faint
hints
of

aftertaste
is
semidry
with
notes
of

and

flavors
with
a

a
very
good
flavor
profile
that
is
true

and
very
pleasant
to

mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
slightly
chalky
feel
very
nice
quite
true
to
style
and
a
good
example
of
an
english
pub
ale
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
classic
northern
english
brown
ale
it
is
true
to
style
and
excels
in
every
regard
and
is
quite
the
nice
treat
i
cannot
find
better
brown
ale
anywhere
samuel
smith
made
what
newcastle
couldnt
even
dream
of
brewing
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
is
the
price
this
is
certainly
a
fantastic
brown
ale
but
i
dont
think
it
is
significantly
better
than
many
regular
priced
local
brews
the
craft
brewery
pricetag
is
a
little
steep
but
of
course
this
ale
deserves
a
lot
of
praise
rich
full
and
smooth
flavor
and
all
said
and
done
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
o
a
fantastic
malty
beer
with
low
bitterness
and
a
great
price
point
one
of
the
best
beer
values
out
there
o
dynamite
its
the
definition
of
the
style
for
a
reason
pours
a
nice
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
great
head
that
lasts
forever
very
good
lacing
smells
nice
and
malty
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
not
too
thin
or
too
thick
very
good
flavor
has
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
nutty
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
o
this
is
not
your
typical
brown
there
are
articulated
flavors
of
nut
and
malt
and
a
subtle
bitterness
that
keeps
the
beer
from
becoming
cloying
or
heavy
a
good
brown
is
often
hard
to
find
and
this
is
a
very
good
brown
tasty
great
example
of
the
style
tho
i
expected
a
dustier
feel
and
less
dark
fruit
o
an
outstanding
beer
that
is
easy
enough
to
find
here
in
chicago
o
very
underwhelmed
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
doesnt
taste
good
either
it
is
just
bland
love
this
stuff
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
i
went
through
a
period
a
while
back
when
i
was
hooked
on
english
brown
ales
like
newcastle
also
at
the
time
i
was
brewing
my
own
using
kits
this
was
far
better
than
anything
i
ever
made
a
sweet
taste
not
hoppy
at
all
good
with
food
and
i
say
that
as
someone
who
rarely
drinks
while
eating
o
this
is
to
me
the
definitive
brown
ale
i
expected
a
lot
and
got
it
here
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
i
almost
want
it
to
cling
a
little
more
prost
lampertland
o
the
smell
is
wonderful
very
enticing
plays
like
a
lightweight
dubbel
with
a
decent
portion
of
its
profile
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
creamier
with
a
fuller
body
i
think
it
provides
a
more
pleasing
experience
closer
to
room
temperature
overall
its
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
if
it
crosses
my
path
again
ill
drink
it
o
this
is
a
shining
example
of
an
english
nut
brown
ale
sessionable
easy
drinking
mild
style
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
english
ales
it
has
everything
an
english
brown
ale
should
and
then
some
do
yourself
a
favor
pour
this
brew
and
try
it
cold
but
let
it
warm
and
take
another
sip
every
few
minutes
to
fully
appreciate
the
complexity
of
this
supreme
being
httpyoutu
beoz0hssyly70
i
see
this
one
in
the
stores
a
lot
so
i
decided
to
have
a
go
well
i
cant
say
it
was
the
most
impressive
nut
brown
ive
had
the
caramel
color
and
aroma
of
nut
and
molasses
are
rather
nice
but
the
flavor
and
body
seem
a
tad
watered
down
for
the
price
ive
paid
it
goes
down
ok
but
has
an
earthy
after
taste
that
comes
back
after
an
hour
that
made
me
want
to
brush
my
teeth
i
cant
say
this
will
be
a
repeat
buy
o
a
fine
quality
brown
ale
tasty
from
start
to
finish
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
nearly
opaque
earthy
brown
color
and
a
foamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
onenote
with
a
dry
nutty
minerallike
quality
and
only
a
little
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
creeping
in
the
sweetness
is
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
but
the
dry
nuttiness
dominates
again
and
the
fine
but
active
carbonation
keeps
the
beer
relatively
light
and
dry
maybe
im
just
missing
some
of
its
nuance
but
this
beer
is
merely
solid
in
my
mind
overall
the
malty
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
beer
are
outstanding
the
slight
hoppy
finish
keeps
it
from
becoming
overly
sweet
making
a
beer
with
heavy
dark
roasted
malts
clean
smooth
and
very
pleasant
a
well
made
traditional
ale
that
is
a
pleasure
to
have
more
than
one
of
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
a
samuel
smith
beer
and
that
includes
with
this
beer
an
easytofind
gem
of
a
beer
o
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
i
could
easily
enjoy
several
pints
of
this
in
an
evening
and
not
be
upset
there
is
something
comfortable
and
workmanlike
about
this
beer
and
that
is
not
to
say
it
is
common
it
is
quite
nice
i
will
revisit
this
beer
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
auburn
color
with
a
creamy
looking
tan
head
of
about
14
its
retention
is
excellent
as
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
for
the
aroma
theres
scents
of
caramel
molasses
and
a
very
bready
toasted
malt
presence
the
taste
is
unbelievably
smooth
with
butterscotch
and
walnut
notes
and
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
the
balance
achieved
here
is
second
to
none
its
got
a
very
full
mouthfeel
but
relatively
light
body
the
finish
pleasantly
lingers
perfect
for
drinking
with
a
nice
dinner
o
this
is
what
a
nut
brown
ale
should
taste
like
it
hits
every
note
excellent
brown
ale
flavorful
and
very
easy
to
drink
for
all
tastes
o
great
english
brown
ale
glad
to
have
tried
it
to
use
as
a
bench
mark
for
other
microbrewers
in
the
area
only
concern
i
have
is
not
knowing
how
fresh
my
bottle
was
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
im
glad
i
found
it
after
years
of
not
having
any
since
my
youth
an
old
school
brown
with
nothing
fancy
or
clever
about
it
just
good
ingredients
and
blended
well
then
left
alone
to
sort
its
self
out
final
grade

a
very
respectable
a
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
perfectly
balanced
moderately
complex
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
is
the
sort
of
ale
that
is
made
for
sessioning
not
my
favourite
beer
from
this
brewery
but
still
a
superb
brown
that
all
english
ale
fans
should
give
a
shot
or
three
hopefully
the
single
bottles
will
make
their
way
here
eventually
overall
really
glad
i
followed
by
curiosity
and
got
this
since
it
is
delicious
full
flavored
but
light
enough
that
more
than
one
could
be
consumed
in
a
sitting
would
recommend
this
to
all
types
of
beer
drinkers
a
very
good
beer
with
some
slightly
different
tastes
adding
to
the
nutty
chocolate
taste
well
worth
a
try
ohad
a
very
good
finish
yet
was
not
too
sweet
overall
3

a
good
beer
and
probably
a
reliable
goto
choice
however
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
legendary
beer
at
any
level
it
is
dry
and
somewhat
flavorless
at
some
taste
levels
there
is
a
good
balance
here
and
it
is
probably
amazing
with
food
but
this
beer
simply
does
not
stand
on
its
own
nor
make
enough
of
an
impression
to
be
a
brew
i
would
consider
sessionable
nonetheless
worth
a
try
if
you
have
never
had
it
before
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
16
oz
champaign
flute
developed
a
good
1
12
to
2
head
that
gradually
reduced
and
made
nice
lacing
several
ounces
had
to
wait
in
the
bottle
for
a
while
medium
dark
amber
in
color
and
clear
aroma
is
toffee
malt
and
hops
flavor
is
subtle
initially
malt
amd
toffee
then
the
hoppy
bitterness
builds
after
a
sip
and
ends
on
a
grapefruit
note
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
overall
i
think
i
prefer
stouts
over
this
style
so
that
may
be
why
i
dont
score
it
as
high
as
others
do
yes
i
too
think
it
compare
well
with
sierra
nevada
tumbler
as
mentioned
below
overallcomments
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
every
had
i
rank
this
right
next
to
tumbler
from
sierra
nevada
on
my
list
of
brown
ales
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
classified
as
an

brown
ale

overall
there
is
wonderful
contrast
between
the
strong
tastes
but
relative
lightness
of
the
beer
this
is
a
great
introduction
to
nut
browns
and
also
a
good
option
for
an
ale
that
is
dark
and
flavorsome
but
not
too
strong
and
filling
would
buy
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
fabio
out
a
very
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
packed
with
malty
goodness
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
overall
much
better
than
other
brown
ales
that
i
have
tested
in
north
england
refreshing
beer
too
overall
a
very
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
i
prefer
one
of
sam
smiths
stouts
but
this
is
an
excellent
alternative
if
you
like
a
beer
that
has
a
flavor
with
more
hops
this
is
the
perfect
celebratory
beer
absolutely
made
for
special
occasions
when
i
bought
it
they
only
had
two
left
and
i
wished
i
had
bought
the
second
a
friend
who
drank
guinness
in
irish
pubs
said
it
was
wonderful
there
and
nothing
like
the
guinness
shipped
to
the
us
so
i
have
some
backing
on
my
thesis
here
i
highly
recommend
you
try
this
a
reddishbrown
hue
that
looks
like
a
nut
brown
should
look
the
nut
aroma
really
comes
through
along
a
some
sweet
overtones
that
smells
like
caramel
the
taste
is
far
and
above
any
other
brown
ales
i
have
tried
it
follows
the
smell
with
a
full
rich
nuttiness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
forever
mouth
feel
smooth
and
silky
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
outstanding
there
may
be
other
nut
browns
out
there
that
top
this
one
but
i
have
yet
to
find
it
iconic
example
of
a
northern
english
brown
pours
amber
brown
with
about
four
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
aroma
is
invitingly
woodsy
nutty
fruity
with
some
peanut
butter
and
toffee
taste
is
an
earthy
nutty
integration
where
individual
components
are
somewhat
difficult
to
pick
out
but
there
is
slowly
developing
sultana
raisin
walnut
oil
peanut
butter
to
match
the
aroma
a
salty
mineral
medicinal
bitterness
subtle
sweet
caramel
a
sourness
shows
up
as
you
go
as
well
i
find
this
one
to
be
less
sweet
than
other
browns
and
theres
almost
a
bit
citrus
in
the
sour
finish
mouthful
fits
the
style
with
some
oil
and
lingering
syrupy
sweetness
nearing
the
end
faint
bourbon
notes
nice
classic
beer
worth
seeking
out
bright
acidic
malts
fairly
lean
hoppier
than
expected
and
just
sharper
and
lighter
than
most
brown
ales
screams
for
a
meatandpotatoes
dinners
to
lift
and
cut
through
i
dont
know
that
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
or
the
best
example
of
the
styles
insofar
as
it
is
a
style
search
zythophile
brown
ale
but
it
does
tick
all
the
boxes
and
drink
fairly
easy
this
beer
is
truly
exceptional
and
one
that
really
got
me
hooked
on
english
style
ales
back
in
the
day
i
cant
believe
its
so
hard
to
find
nowadays
i
was
excited
when
i
bought
this
beer
boy
was
i
disappointed
afterwards
though
sam
smiths
brown
ale
looks
amazing
when
you
poor
it
into
a
nice
pint
glass
the
brown
and
reddish
color
looks
great
and
tasty
when
i
took
my
first
sip
i
was
very
disappointed
im
not
sure
what
it
was
about
this
brown
ale
but
it
didnt
sit
well
with
me
i
feel
like
this
beer
didnt
have
enough
toffee
or
caramel
taste
for
me
something
seemed
to
be
missing
from
the
taste
i
kept
drinking
the
beer
hoping
something
would
change
but
it
never
did
i
drank
my
whole
pint
because
i
didnt
want
to
waste
it
but
ill
probably
never
buy
this
again
overall
impression
a
nice
northern
english
brown
exhibiting
strong
bready
and
dark
malt
character
with
nuttiness
and
fruitiness
on
the
earth
overall
a
fantastic
beer
a
credit
to
brown
ales
and
to
english
brewing
overall
it
exceeded
my
expectations
a
great
brew
for
fall
and
winter
reminiscent
of
a
rainy
and
cool
english
autumn
day
full
of
taste
and
body
perhaps
the
finest
of
the
english
brown
ales
i
look
forward
to
sampling
further
brews
from
samuel
smith
overall
solid
beer
that
doesnt
really
work
for
my
palate
around
a
3
75
in
my
estimation
but
im
guessing
it
would
be
closer
to
a
4
if
the
style
suited
me
would
get
again
without
hesitation
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
a
decent
aftertaste
with
too
much
bitterness
and
metallic
taste
in
the
forefront
mouthfeel
is
pretty
dissapointing
as
well
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
wouldnt
turn
downbut
wouldnt
seek
out
again
o
this
is
essentially
the
category
defining
beer
for
an
english
style
nut
brown
many
american
nut
browns
have
moved
towards
more
sweetness
while
samuel
smith
maintains
the
ideal
rich
malt
and
mellow
hop
balance
god
is
there
nothing
samuel
smith
cant
do
ive
heard
for
a
while
that
this
was
one
of
their
staples
but
as
someone
who
tends
to
avoid
brown
ales
i
never
went
for
it
right
away
how
i
missed
out
while
i
feel
some
of
their
other
beers
are
more
satisfying
in
a
session
this
remains
hearty
flavorful
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
staple
in
the
style
at
hand
and
perhaps
given
the
affordable
and
widespread
value
the
best
in
the
style
excellent
stuff
i
will
never
turn
one
down
if
offered
o
a
very
wellrounded
brown
ale
samuel
smith
never
disappoints
o
a
refreshing

slick

is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
english
brown
ale
great
balance
and
complexity
of
robust
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
certainly
a
classic
for
the
style
smooth
but
rustic
and
nutty
respect
for
the
old
school
is
required
here
even
if
it
isnt
your
thing
after
trying
it
which
everyone
should
my
personal
favorite
was
always
the
old
brewery
pale
ale
and
i
will
be
sure
to
grab
one
of
those
to
review
on
my
next
trip
to
the
beer
store
o
pretty
decent
beer
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
as
it
was
highly
pricey
and
despite
the
high
reviews
for
me
it
was
forgettable
but
still
pretty
good
nothing
stood
out
but
it
fell
inline
quiet
nicely
overall
this
is
what
an
english
brown
should
taste
like
absolutely
blows
newcastle
away
in
terms
of
flavor
aroma
and
mouthfeel
if
only
this
beer
was
the
price
of
newcastle
it
would
be
a
regular
staple
in
my
fridge
o
if
this
thing
laced
up
and
down
the
glass
itd
be
straight
across
the
board
5s
because
lacing
really
makes
a
beer
pop
in
my
opinion
i
dock
it
just
a
bit
the
bottom
line
if
you
like
malt
this
is
it
such
a
great
english
ale
and
my
personal
favorite
break
from
the
massive
hopcrazy
american
beers
this
one
is
arguably
better
than
samuel
smiths
old
brewery
pale
ale
which
for
me
is
a
stalwart
of
a
beer
overall
a
true
classic
that
i
have
enjoyed
over
the
years
best
nut
brown
ale
on
the
planet
goes
down
incredibly
easily
this
one
is
smooth
well
balanced
and
with
a
basic
but
very
nice
taste
the
drink
started
to
fade
ever
so
slightly
at
the
very
end
but
this
was
not
really
that
noticeable
and
it
is
still
a
very
nice
beer
not
only
is
this
my
favorite
brown
ale
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
truly
a
world
class
hard
to
knock
classically
good
and
solid
a
very
traditional
and
humble
example
o
excellent
beer
the
price
for
such
a
quality
sample
of
the
style
is
nearly
second
to
none
highly
recommended
even
for
newcomers
as
this
isnt
nearly
as
intimidating
as
many
other
toprated
beers
as
good
as
advertised
and
super
cheap
for
the
quality
i
cant
believe
how
long
i
waited
to
try
this
what
was
i
thinking
the
pour
is
a
remarkably
clear
dark
maple
syrup
color
with
a
bubble
bath
head
of
tan
foam
that
wont
quit
the
nose
is
the
weakest
like
smells
like
malty
ale
yeast
rather
bland
really
the
flavor
through
really
opens
up
this
is
a
caramel
almondy
malt
bomb
but
it
isnt
sweet
if
you
can
imagine
that
its
got
a
bitter
dry
finish
more
akin
to
cashews
or
something
unsalted
of
course
with
some
mild
chocolate
essence
and
this
only
gets
more
dramatic
as
it
warms
up
not
incredibly
complex
but
more
of
a
simple
elegance
vibe
here
did
i
mention
this
beer
looks
sexy
im
down
to
my
last
swig
and
the
head
is
as
big
as
it
was
when
i
poured
it
some
45
minutes
ago
just
astonishing
lovely
mouthfeel
as
well
cleanish
in
the
finish
with
a
flatly
medium
body
and
that
casky
english
ale
carbonation
nice
and
mellow
this
is
a
really
drinkable
brown
too
glorious
without
all
those
residual
sugars
i
always
knew
sam
smith
wash
high
quality
stuff
but
i
think
its
wide
availability
made
me
overlook
it
in
favor
of
some
of
the
rarer
american
craft
stuff
with
two
delicious
offerings
from
these
guys
in
the
last
week
i
will
no
longer
walk
past
their
shelf
i
will
be
grabbing
up
the
other
varieties
as
quick
as
i
can
now
this
stuff
is
the
nectar
the
second
i
started
drinking
this
beer
i
did
not
want
to
stop
there
are
nice
flavors
in
here
and
has
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
im
definitely
going
to
drink
it
again
solid
beer
a
great
beer
and
should
be
at
the
top
of
this
category
oi
was
disappointed
a
bit
by
this
however
it
was
still
very
good
i
must
have
had
my
expectations
too
high
in
the
end
it
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
version
of
newcastle
i
just
got
home
from
jiujitsu
and
drank
one
of
these
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
its
light
but
with
enough
flavor

you
arent

abv

my
review
may
sound
a
bit
bizarre
or
show
my
lack
of
a
palate
but
when
i
first
tried
the
beer
today
i
felt
it
was
overly
nutty
so
i
was
not
totally
please
with
it
however
i
continued
to
drink
it
while
i
noshed
on
homemade
tortilla
chips
salted
and
avocado
with
a
homemade
spicy
sauce
then
the
beer
took
a
totally
different
taste
it
immediately
made
happy
to
know
that
some
beers
go
great
with
certain
foods
and
tastes
yes
people
say
this
all
the
time
in
essence
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
with
food
overall
samuel
smith
nut
brown
ale
presents
itself
as
an
excellent
choice
for
those
nights
when
you
seek
a
good
english
brown
ale
o
a
decent
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
has
a
few
unique
attributes
glad
i
finally
ticked
this
ubiquitous
ale
flavors
of
dark
roasted
malts
minerals
slight
coffee
toffee
carob
pecans
slight
bitterness
burnt
brown
sugar
theres
some
richness
and
body
modest
malts
light
hops
dry
finish
not
bad
but
not
particular
smooth
or
tasty
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
but
will
continue
to
try
other
nut
browns
english
but
not
insane
sam
smiths
was
one
of
my
introductions
to
craft
beer
start
here
and
you
cant
really
go
wrong
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
fluffy
biscuit
colored
head
developed
which
lasted
and
some
what
laced
well
aroma
was
mild
with
caramel
and
malt
tones
appearance
was
a
clear
dark
amber
almost
a
brown
red
color
taste
was
very
smooth
with
caramel
notes
and
a
light
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
slightly
carbonated
aftertaste
was
dry
and
mild
overall
a
great
brown
ale
i
will
have
another
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
45
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
decent
retention
the
smell
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
some
toffee
and
a
fruity
note
the
taste
follows
from
the
smell
its
sweet
but
not
overly
so
im
getting
a
slight
fruity
note
along
with
some
caramel
the
finish
is
full
of
slightly
sweet
grain
the
beer
is
dry
seems
slightly
chalky
smooth
carbonation
o
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
this
style
and
this
is
amongst
the
best
of
them
o
great
brown
ale
lots
of
flavor
sweet
very
candy
like
alway
enjoyable
always
availble
whats
not
to
love
about
sammy
smiths
the
deep
brownreddish
color
with
a
slightly
tanned
neck
makes
the
appearance
of
this
beer
very
pleasing
in
the
smell
we
can
detect
some
caramellike
idea
but
not
too
exuberant
the
taste
is
wellbalanced
yet
subtle
in
many
ways
the
hopness
body
and
carbonation
are
all
from
low
to
medium
the
last
specially
in
the
body
very
good
nut
brown
was
expecting
a
bit
more
of
a
bite
but
it
was
very
mellow
good
blend
of
caramel
nuts
toffee
and
bread
excellent
overall
taste
and
appearance
not
tremendously
filling
which
is
a
good
thing
recommended
and
will
def
drink
again
nice
looking
reddish
brown
in
the
glass
with
light
tan
head
smell
for
me
is
predominately
brown
sugar
still
get
the
brown
sugar
in
the
taste
but
not
so
pronounced
otherwise
its
a
nice
malt
and
nutty
bread
taste
which
is
absolutely
delicious
im
a
big
fan
of
browns
and
this
one
is
right
there
at
the
top
worthy
of
all
the
raving
o
really
nice
nutty
brown
ale
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
get
this
again
sam
smith
has
a
brown
ale
that
displays
great
session
ability
and
versatility
with
various
dishes
while
more
oomph
would
be
appreciated
its
still
a
big
step
up
from
the
likes
of
newcastle
othis
is
slightly
disappointing
but
its
a
decent
brown
ale
and
has
plenty
of
taste
for
a
5
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
their
porter
but
not
much
is
o
beautiful
and
unique
taste
profile
the
best
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
o
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
admittedly
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
fine
take
on
it
with
a
nice
if
occasionally
overly
sweet
mix
of
flavors
c
overall
a
easy
drinking
nut
brown
not
the
smoothest
of
flavor
transitions
and
a
little
weak
in
body
but
still
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
o
sell
your
soul
for
just
a
taste
of
this
beer
if
i
had
to
drink
one
beverage
for
the
rest
of
my
life
other
than
water
this
would
be
it
a
meal
in
itself
but
a
perfect
partner
with
nearly
anything
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
meal
with
which
this
doesnt
go
perfectly
the
best
beer
on
the
planet
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
versatile
offering
from
samuel
smith
i
like
the
flavors
and
it
did
a
good
job
of
warming
me
up
on
a
winter
evening
in
fact
for
a
winter
treat
i
would
prefer
this
brew
rather
than
samuel
smiths
winter
seasonal
the
nut
brown
is
a
good
addition
to
samuel
smiths
lineup
though
not
quite
as
good
as
their
famous
oatmeal
stout
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
really
good
and
impressive
english
brown
ale
so
far
i
really
like
samuel
smiths
hope
to
have
more
given
the
previous
reviews
and
my
own
expectations
i
expected
a
stronger
nut
flavor
that
i
didnt
pick
up
on
if
anything
there
was
more
of
a
caramel
sweet
flavor
i
wasnt
at
all
expecting
bottle
poured
at
satches
in
gainesville
pours
light
brown
with
a
small
head
aroma
of
very
slight
nut
and
something
i
can
only
describe
as
liquor
the
flavor
follows
with
a
watered
down
nuttiness
and
hints
of
roast
and
hops
strangely
mixed
in
my
second
english
style
brown
and
not
sure
that
i
am
a
fan
somewhat
rich
malt
and
highly
carbonated
glad
i
tried
it
o
overall
this
beer
was
wayyy
too
damn
sweet
i
doubt
id
have
it
again
poured
from
750
ml
bottle
into
pint
pours
a
nice
brown
almost
clear
color
with
nice
white
head
great
sweet
malts
and
a
deffinite
nutty
aroma
taste
is
just
spot
on
sweet
nutty
malts
it
has
a
great
bitter
nutty
finish
to
balance
this
brew
out
fantastically
smooth
and
flavorful
this
is
what
a
nut
brown
should
be
o
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
easy
to
find
quite
delicious
and
well
balanced
as
well
great
stuff
mouthfeel
zest
through
carbonation
perhaps
and
some
bitterness
but
also
smooth
with
some
thickness
the
nut
flavor
is
in
the
after
taste
and
sits
on
the
tongue
for
a
good
bit
popped
the
top
and
poured
into
a
cold
glass
mug
with
a
good
sniff
the
strong
rich
malts
are
lovingly
over
powering
after
letting
this
ale
breathe
for
a
minute
the
taste
is
as
you
would
expect
from
world
class
high
quality
nut
brown
ale
this
one
delivers
fullbodied
and
somewhat
bitter
with
strong
flavor
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
again
enjoyable
but
not
tremendously
exciting
at
least
not
anymore
for
this
longtime
samuel
smiths
fan
poured
a
rubyorangeishbrown
clear
with
some
effervescing
bubbles
rising
from
the
center
og
the
glass
and
a
tan
twofinger
head
smell
is
minimal
with
maybe
an
oatmeal
scentthe
taste
is
very
well
balanced
a
little
sweet
on
the
front
but
a
little
bitter
as
it
leaves
light
and
minimally
carbonated
it
has
that
taste
that
some
of
the
sweet
caramelly
commercial
german
octoberfests
possess
but
is
a
cleaner
version
and
much
easier
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
should
be
kept
as
a
standby
in
case
youre
trying
a
new
brew
which
turns
out
nasty
the
low
abv
necessitates
a
side
of
a
good
whiskey
or
bourbon
though
a
disappointing
beer
makes
me
think
i
got
an
old
bottle
no
date
listed
on
the
label
since
i
get
very
little
brown
ale
malt
sweetness
in
the
taste
looks
and
aroma
promised
good
things
but
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
anticipation
i
have
had
better
bottles
of
this
beer
in
the
past
unfortunately
this
is
the
one
i
happened
to
review
and
so
it
goes
with
drinking
imported
beer
without
any
bottling
information
o
another
amazing
beer
from
samuel
smith
very
crisp
and
easy
going
but
still
has
ample
amounts
of
flavor
not
over
bearing
a
must
try
o
one
of
if
not
the
iconic
english
brown
this
is
one
i
come
back
to
occasionally
and
enjoy
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
almost
transcends
the
category
of
beer
and
belongs
to
the
work
of
art
category
it
pours
an
absolutely
beautiful
clear
molassses
or
mahogany
color
with
a
fluffy
light
tan
two
finger
head
retention
is
excellent
and
the
lacing
is
among
some
of
the
best
and
most
elaborate
i
have
ever
seen
smell
is
pine
roasted
nuts
honey
and
maybe
a
little
hint
of
soy
sauce
meant
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
full
and
pleasing
taste
is
a
pleasing
lemon
on
the
front
followed
by
roasted
nuts
on
the
finish
it
is
perfectly
balanced
drinking
this
beer
is
almost
like
meeting
the
girl
of
your
dreams
where
have
you
been
all
of
my
life
overall
a
classic
brown
and
one
of
the
great
ones
at
that
wonderful
allaround
beer
to
go
along
with
a
great
flavor
profile
everything
newcastle
tries
to
be
but
falls
short
not
a
big
brown
guy
but
this
is
one
of
a
handful
id
gladly
drink
with
regularity
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
definitely
would
come
back
to
o
one
of
the
first
craft
brews
i
ever
tried
returning
to
it
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brown
that
is
worthy
of
a
try
particularly
for
those
who
are
nuts
for
nuts
hehe
odnice
brew
didnt
strike
me
as
awesome
still
plenty
fine
wouldnt
buy
it
again
a
decent
time
however
enjoy
o
this
beer
deserves
the
acclaim
it
has
received
over
the
years
from
michael
jackson
to
beer
advocate
its
malty
nutty
flavor
is
simply
one
of
the
best
that
can
be
found
in
the
world
for
brown
ales
if
i
am
to
raise
any
question
the
mouthfeel
might
be
a
bit
creamier
and
i
am
nitpicking
overall
a
nicely
put
together
ale
but
the
overpowering
nut
and
metallic
flavours
are
unpleasant
at
least
to
me
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
carameltoffee
and
some
nutty
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
burnt
carameltoffee
slight
nuts
and
some
slight
fruity
flavors
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
that
lingers
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
that
makes
it
quite
easy
to
drink
o
a
nice
nut
brown
but
the
strong
mineral
character
throws
things
off
for
me
a
bit
o
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
drank
thus
far
o
very
drinkable
good
example
of
the
style
a
classic
that
is
a
benchmark
compare
others
to
d
this
had
a
very
nice
smell
with
good
taste
and
ok
body
it
had
a
smooth
finish
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
solid
classic
brew
but
not
super
delicious
o
an
excepcional
world
class
example
of
an
brown
ale
o
this
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
i
have
been
enjoying
english
brown
ales
lately
as
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
excellent
hop
bombs
produced
here
in
n
cal
so
many
brews
so
little
time
o
pretty
dang
good
a
good
late
summer
and
fall
beer
i
had
it
a
little
too
early
in
the
summer
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
i
have
been
meaning
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
experience
the
ale
was
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
generous
head
of
approximately
34
of
an
inch
the
aroma
spoke
volumes
of
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
while
still
giving
hints
of
sour
to
come
in
the
initial
taste
i
noticed
the
malts
with
a
sour
taste
in
the
front
the
backbone
of
the
taste
was
a
sweet
candylike
flavor
that
reminded
me
of
twizzlers
licorice
the
promised
nuttiness
dances
amid
the
tastes
giving
it
a
wellrounded
experience
in
the
aftertaste
the
sour
of
this
brown
ale
stands
alone
it
is
a
pleasant
sour
that
sticks
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
allows
the
flavor
to
linger
i
believe
the
ale
was
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
but
this
was
not
a
big
mark
against
the
beer
overall
this
is
a
flavorful
brown
that
is
a
standard
bearer
for
the
style
overallthe
english
know
how
to
brew
an
excellent
beer
i
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
who
wants
a
full
flavored
fullbodied
and
sessionable
brew
great
quality
and
wellbalanced
this
tastes
great
with
bbq
brats
and
potatoes
cheers
overall
another
great
brew
from
samuel
smith
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
was
very
enjoyable
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
dark
brown
with
a
frothy
light
tan
head
plenty
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
transparent
at
the
ends
of
the
glass
where
it
is
reddish
brown
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
sticky
lacking
on
the
side
of
the
glass
i
can
pick
up
smells
of
dark
roasted
barley
malts
and
nuts
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
nut
bread
smell
the
taste
follows
the
nose
theres
a
rich
maltiness
to
this
beer
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
the
nuttiness
blends
well
with
the
malt
flavor
i
can
also
pick
up
some
mild
toffee
and
vanilla
flavors
in
this
beer
as
well
the
body
is
medium
with
plentiful
carbonation
for
as
rich
as
the
beer
tastes
the
feel
is
much
lighter
than
the
taste
its
slightly
watery
and
very
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
most
excellent
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
this
is
a
great
example
of
this
style

session
beers
dont
get
any
more
easygoing
than
this
and
this
beer
has
a
nice
almond
and
walnut
undertone
without
feeling
too
light
or
nutty
the
body
could
have
been
a
bit
more
filling
but
the
taste
was
enjoyable
and
even
if
its
not
fall
this
was
about
as
good
as
a
brown
ale
gets
medium
body
with
solid
effervescence
slightly
watery
at
the

but
fills
out
midsip
and
beyond
slight
warming
at
the

smooth
and
delicious
a
standard
bearer
fro
the
style
o
i
dont
know
if
the
condition
of
this
bottle
was
ideal
but
i
think
there
are
other
brown
ales
that
surpass
this
one
its
a
classic
version
of
the
style
that
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
head
with
flavor
but
eases
its
way
into
your
heart
pours

not

favorites
either
kinda

reminds
me

newcastle
like
drinkin
ice

not
very
exciting
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
beer
drink
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
unique
in
flavor
and
feel
i
love
this
beer
for
the
pricepoint
and
its
only
5
definitely
different
than
the
typical
american
style
which
tends
to
be
dryer
and
less
sweet
more
like
a
watered
down
porter
this
is
super
fruity
sweet
almost
like
a
dubbel
or
doppelbock
but
with
an
english
biscuity
nutty
malty
backbone
and
earthy
hops
really
an
interesting
beer
and
highly
recommend
o
very
solid
beer
and
an
old
one
that
stands
up
to
all
comers
quality
on
every
sip
o
another
oldie
but
goodie
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
since
the
mid1990s
and
it
has
always
been
solid
probably
the
quintessential
english
brown
ale
very
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
and

definitely
one
to
get

pack
o
very
enjoyable
obviously
wellcrafted
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
love
the
nuttiness
about
it
i
have
been
on
a
english
brown
kick
as
of
late
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
in
show
almost
all
5s
i
did
smell
one
better
brown
ale
so
i
will
reserve
the
perfect
score
but
that
is
nitpicking
if
you
havent
tried
this
it
is
a
must
dark
brown
with
a
medium
thick
to
thick
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
behind
sweet
yet
sour
malt
aroma
with
a
nutty
hoppiness
in
the
background
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
sweet
chocolate
malt
flavor
witha
nutty
hop
background
and
a
chocolatey
finish
medium
bodied
overall
i
bought
this
in
a
three
pack
recently
read
absolutely
nothing
about
it
and
dont
regret
a
penny
nor
time
consuming
it
it
might
come
off
a
notch
sweet
to
some
taste
buds
but
very
hard
to
compare
this
and
call
any
other
brown
ale
better
hope
you
all
enjoyed
salud
o
overall
im
not
sure
on
this
one
the
first
few
sips
i
was
thinking
not
but
kept
finding
myself
wanting
another
sip
by
the
end
of
the
beer
i
found
myself
wishing
i
had
a
second
still
not
sure
though
o
the
hops
arent
noticeable
as
this
one
centers
around
the
great
malt
character
a
classic
english
ale
thats
great
to
relax
with
forgot
how
good
this
one
is
o
aaaand
samuel
smith
with
the
win
this
time
for
english
brown
ales
this
brew
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
nuttier
version
of
samuel
smiths
imperial
stout
its
just
as
satisfying
in
nose
taste
and
feel
and
just
as
perfect
as
the
quintessential
beer
for
the
style
o
a
perfect
example
of
english
brown
ale
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
would
be
sessionable
if
not
for
the
large
bottle
overall
a
beautiful
beer
that
has
some
good
flavor
and
aromatic
complexity
and
for
10
along
with
the
glass
and
two
other
offerings
an
absolute
bargain
o
this
beer
sets
the
standard
for
nut
brown
ales
although
not
the
most
popular
style
this
be
deserves
a
try
just
to
completely
understand
how
a
brown
ale
should
taste
another
solid
brew
from
samuel
smith
cheers
overall
very
underwhelming
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
an
old
one
as
i
cant
locate
a
date
o
really
good
i
typically
find
the
english
styles
lacking
but
this
highlighted
the
some
good
brewing
that
makes
you
work
a
bit
but
well
worth
it
start
it
at
50
degrees
and
let
it
warm
this
brown
ale
is
a
very
true
brown
color
the
hold
is
light
like
most
english
style
beers
the
carbonation
is
also
low
the
aroma
is
mild
with
a
roasty
background
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
it
is
almost
like
water
when
you
first
sip
it
it
is
not
very
bitter
and
leaves
a
slightly
sweet
taste
in
your
mouth
pours
a
dark
cloudy
caramel
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
toasted
caramel
malts
with
some
dark
fruity
esters
and
some
cacao
notes
fill
the
senses
taste
of
some
sweet
toasted
dark
malts
with
a
nice
cacao
and
nutty
flavor
and
light
hops
some
yeasty
notes
in
the
flavor
as
well
palate
is
a
full
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouth
feel
and
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
toasted
caramel
malts
some
yeast
and
ending
with
a
slightly
bitter
hops
cacao
nutty
aftertaste
overall
a
very
good
flavorful
and
enjoyable
brew
o
a
wonderful
and
clean
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
a
brown
ale
should
be
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
im
sure
that
the
beer
is
consistently
good
and
reliable
i
like
it
but
i
dont
intend
to
try
it
again
in
my
view
the
beer
doesnt
meet
the
promise
that
i
was
hoping
for
but
its
still
a
great
brown
ale
overall
another
brilliant
beer
from
samuel
smiths
high
quality
in
all
areas
and
very
sessionable
brown
ales
are
a
style
im
growing
to
like
and
this
one
is
certainly
worthwhile
overall
very
straightforward
and
pleasant
beer
to
drink
with
a
depth
and
richness
of
flavour
that
puts
it
ahead
of
many
nut
brown
ales
overall
another
great
sammy
smith
beer
great
for
drinking
on
any
occasion
just
like
having
your
cake
and
eating
it
too
o
the
sweetness
factor
here
was
just
too
much
for
me
overall
just
a
superb
brown
ale
the
kind
of
thing
that
sam
smith
is
so
good
at
there
is
nothing
obscure
or
wild
about
this
beer
it
is
just
made
with
basic
ingredients
using
old
fashioned
methods
and
the
the
result
is
a
legendary
nut
brown
ale
this
is
surely
regarded
as
a
classic
to
many
and
i
will
advocate
for
the
same
so
wonderfully
simple
and
yet
so
unique
sam
smith
is
a
hell
of
a
brewery
conclusion
another
great
beer
from
samuel
smiths
o
not
a
big
fan
of
this
to
be
frank
though
i
dont
hate
it
at
all
probably
my
least
favorite
samuel
smith
beer
to
date
and
not
something
id
willingly
go
for
in
the
future
unless
i
caught
it
on
draft
o
definitely
gets
better
as
it
warms
may
have
had
this
one
too
cold
overall
not
all
that
bad
may
be
an
acquired
taste
do
not
get
the
world
class
rating
to
each
his
own
in
my
opinion
this
one
smells
way
better
than
it
tastes
poured
from
a
550
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
decent
off
white
head
the
smells
are
of
caramel
and
toffee
malts
with
a
hint
of
nuts
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
little
nutty
flavor
lots
of
malts
i
really
want
more
nut
like
elements
here
this
beer
is
extremely
one
dimensional
even
for
the
style
i
suspect
a
fresher
bottle
would
bring
in
some
more
complexity
and
and
give
some
more
balance
to
the
malt
sadly
i
cant
really
seek
out
fresher
versions
of
this
living
in
the
states
o
great
balance
very
interesting
flavors
and
pleasing
smell
definitely
a
favorite
i
dont
see
the
appeal
to
this
beer
to
be
honest
o
i
like
the
flavor
a
lot
and
see
this
beer
as
a
reliable
choice
when
you
seek
something
of
the
type
im
not
too
familiar
with
nut
brown
ales
so
dont
relish
this
one
as
much
as
other
reviewers
but
i
like
this
beer
and
will
buy
it
again
o
a
great
beer
for
the
cooler
weather
defiantly
in
my
top
five
nut
browns
and
readily
available
too
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
dense
creamy
khakicolored
head
that
hangs
around
for
some
time
eventually
settling
to
a
nice
cap
leaves
lots
of
craggy
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
sweet
malty
aromas
of
roasted
nuts
caramel
and
baked
bread
similar
to
the
nose
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malt
roasted
nuts
baked
bread
and
toasted
grains
delicious
and
so
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
moderately
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
sets
the
standard
for
an
english
brown
ale
amazing
beer
o
i
found
this
beer
was
good
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
was
good
the
taste
certainly
got
better
as
it
warmed
it
felt
a
little
to
light
though
still
a
good
buy
i
give
it
an
overall
of
5
0
o
a
very
good
brown
ale
nice
nutty
flavor
mingles
with
sweet
maltiness
without
overpowering
the
other
flavors
a
good
heavy
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
mild
meal
another
great
beer
from
samuel
smiths
overall
its
very
pleasing
to
smell
and
taste
i
really
enjoy
it
have
not
tried
this
before
so
its
a
new
find
for
me
that
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
if
you
like
beers
like
this
please
try
it
and
it
should
be
enjoyable
for
you
i
had
a
bottle
of
ss
nut
brown
ale
last
night
at
dinner
at
bstreet
in
newton
poured
into
a
tall
pils
glass
dark
brown
color
but
has
a
clear
body
not
opaque
minimal
head
and
not
much
lacing
smell
had
a
roasted
chestnut
aroma
lurking
in
the
glass
i
enjoyed
the
taste
very
much
there
was
mostly
malt
dominating
here
lightly
toasted
it
gave
this
beer
warm
rich
flavors
of
toffee
and
caramel
mouthfeel
was
smooth
for
a
brown
ale
but
had
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
at
the
end
this
was
a
flavorful
beer
and
it
paired
well
with
a
thick
glazed
pork
chop
o
this
is
easily
the
best
english
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
if
you
have
yet
to
try
this
one
make
a
point
of
doing
so
in
the
very
near
future
o
this
is
okay
but
i
dont
think
i
care
much
for
brown
ales
they
all
tend
to
be
a
bit
bland
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
though
and
maybe
one
day
my
palate
will
appreciate
it
better
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
id
say
its
probably
the
best
english
browns
of
which
im
partial
ive
ever
had
there
isnt
much
i
would
addomit
tofrom
this
beer
in
beer
fantasy
land
its
damn
near
perfect
if
you
like
english
browns
this
is
the
quintessential
example
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
that
really
didnt
impress
me
too
much
i
had
pretty
high
hopes
for
this
highly
acclaimed
english
brown
ale
but
there
were
a
couple
things
about
this
beer
that
really
werent
for
me
and
left
me
disappointed
it
went
down
somewhat
smooth
but
for
me
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
made
this
beer
not
too
drinkable
i
am
glad
i
am
splitting
this
with
my
brother
it
might
be
a
chore
for
me
to
finish
the
bottle
by
myself
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
look
it
looked
pretty
damn
good
especially
in
the
brewerys
signature
pint
glass
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
aroma
it
smelled
very
similar
to
sherry
with
a
little
bit
of
apple
juice
and
the
taste
was
way
too
sweet
with
not
enough
nutty
flavor
to
it
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
enjoy
american
versions
of
english
brown
ales
much
more
then
this
beer
i
think
they
have
a
better
malt
profile
better
body
and
a
better
nut
flavor
in
most
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
to
see
where
you
stand
on
the
traditional
take
on
a
brown
ale
but
if
you
are
use
to
the
american
versions
this
might
be
a
bit
too
sweet
like
it
was
for
me
i
had
very
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
it
just
didnt
live
up
to
them
it
was
too
sweet
and
not
nutty
enough
for
a
beer
labeled
as
a
nut
brown
after
reading
some
other
reviews
i
think
this
beer
might
be
a
little
old
but
with
no
bottling
date
i
cant
be
sure
and
i
dont
think
an
old
beer
would
would
be
the
cause
of
the
high
level
of
sweetness
that
made
this
beer
a
little
hard
to
drink
its
safe
to
say
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
hope
the
other
two
from
the
holiday
pack
are
much
better
then
this
one
was
o
i
cant
really
get
past
the
sour
taste
but
everything
else
is
great
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
perfect
carbonation
for
allowing
the
taste
to
come
through
first
basically
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
goes
down
the
throat
like
a
whisper
the
taste
stays
with
me
o
im
a
huge
fan
of
samuel
smith
and
this
is
my
goto
brown
ale
nothing
about
this
beer
is
muted
its
full
of
wonderfully
sweet
flavors
that
balance
out
well
and
never
over
the
top
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
made
into
a
full
bodied
experience
this
brew
is
unusually
thinbodied
and
very
light
yet
full
of
flavor
initially
this
comes
across
as
sweet
up
front
with
an
almost
sour
hops
finish
overall
an
easytodrink
brown
ale
but
not
as
good
as
id
hoped
its
better
than
average
but
not
quite
good
there
are
no
major
flaws
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
o
one
of
my
favorites
also
one
of
the
first
real
craft
beers
i
got
into
this
was
the
one
that
cost
a
bit
more
but
was
worth
the
taste
perfect
with
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
this
was
a
very
good
ale
bordering
on
perfect
for
my
taste
the
smell
was
a
wonderful
sweet
malted
barley
smell
color
was
a
dark
brown
coffee
color
matching
its
complex
odor
the
taste
was
an
amazing
mix
of
dark
malt
and
a
bitter
sweet
hoppiness
that
drove
the
flavor
home
the
feel
in
the
mouth
was
silky
and
a
after
taste
was
a
wonderful
nutty
like
flavor
that
the
title
bears
the
ales
name
nut
brown
ale
o
the
finest
brown
ale
ive
ever
tasted
the
epitome
of
its
class
id
drink
this
a
couple
of
times
a
week
but
for
the
price
if
i
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
on
tap
be
sure
that
id
pay
handsomely
for
the
chance
d
definitely
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
yet
striking
a
great
balance
between
rich
sophisticated
malt
flavour
and
the
sessionability
of
dark
milds
hearty
and
moreish
its
worth
seeking
out
for
anyone
who
likes
english
ales
and
a
perfect
example
of
north
countrystyle
brown
ale
o
one
the
greats
that
i
have
tried
so
far
nothing
bad
to
report
just
overall
a
great
among
nut
browns
o
great
nut
brown
ale
smooth
and
tasty
and
went
down
way
to
easy
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
overall
brown
ales
arent
my
favorite
beer
style
but
this
one
is
balanced
perfectly
and
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
the
low
abv
would
make
this
a
great
session
beer
for
the
malt
lovers
out
there
overall
a
very
wellcrafted
brown
ale
i
will
admit
that
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
there
have
been
a
few
pleasant
surprises
for
me
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
them
o
pretty
good
beer
but
not
something
i
am
going
to
actively
seek
out
solid
just
not
overly
exciting
o
this
is
actually
my
first
sam
smith
im
generally
a
fan
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
but
i
might
have
it
again
o
i
always
feel
like
samuel
smith
products
feel
a
little
thin
maybe
it
just
feels
like
this
because
of
the
lack
of
alcohol
content
it
just
doesnt
offer
the
kick
that
i
truly
desire
this
is
far
from
a
bad
drink
but
why
are
they
holding
back
on
that
alcohol
content
hopefully
with
their
other
drinks
i
will
not
react
this
same
way
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
rust
color
with
thin
foam
and
lasting
lace
its
aroma
is
nutty
toast
biscuits
and
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
the
flavor
is
complex
beginning
with
caramel
nuts
biscuits
and
toffee
with
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
maple
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
an
oily
medium
full
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
is
a
very
good
beer
great
on
a
cool
fall
night
highly
recommended
m
not
a
terribly
easy
drinker
due
to
the
strong
maltiness
and
low
carbonation
compared
to
the
medium
viscosity
a
very
well
made
beer
with
great
consistency
highly
drinkable
and
easy
going
that
fits
the
style
wonderfully
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
this
is
one
of
those
fancy
imports
that
seems
to
crop
up
at
tourist
locations
but
not
my
local
grocery
ive
seen
it
at
multiple
shops
in
yellowstone
and
hot
springs
national
parks
this
one
i
picked
up
at
world
market
for
2
the
simple
yet
elegant
bottle
with
gold
foil
certainly
gives
the
initial
impression
of
a
regal
brew
and
this
beer
delivers
the
flavor
is
rich
and
smooth
and
is
paired
with
an
exceptionally
creamy
body
this
would
be
my
ideal
session
beer
if
i
could
find
it
locally
at
a
reasonable
price
but
alas
neither
condition
is
met
i
guess
ill
only
get
to
partake
during
special
occasions
or
roadtrips
notes
i
used
to
rank
this
beer
much
higher
it
is
a
good
and
tasty
beer
but
i
no
longer
consider
it
one
of
the
best
sweet
on
the
front
of
the
palate
but
not
overly
so
molasses
and
caramel
are
there
with
just
a
smidge
of
that
fruitiness
from
the
nose
a
small
but
notable
hit
of
hops
touches
the
middle
of
the
palate
spicing
it
up
the
back
of
the
palate
plays
the
caramel
malts
up
showing
off
a
sweetness
that
rounds
everything
out
superbly
a
nutty
taste
resides
in
the
back
of
the
palate
as
well
sticking
around
with
the
linger
as
well
this
gives
the
beer
the
full
balance
and
as
it
drinks
smoothly
and
finishes
dryly
you
are
left
wanting
another
sip
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
with
high
drinkability
and
a
great
taste
sam
smith
always
has
great
beers
brewed
to
style
and
never
with
any
off
flavors
giving
them
the
longevity
that
they
have
prospered
from
one
of
the
best
and
most
consistent
browns
a
daily
drinker
if
there
ever
was
one
nice
clean
smell
and
the
taste
was
the
same
not
overpowering
but
very
pleasant
with
a
definite
nuttiness
a
good
drinking
beer
or
goes
well
with
a
steak
i
will
have
again
and
again
o
this
beer
was
surprisingly
tasty
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
absolutely
worth
all
of
the
praise
it
receives
overall
very
delicious
brown
ale
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
proving
that
flavorful
beer
doesnt
always
have
to
be
accompanied
by
a
high
abv
fullbodied
with
the
slightest
amount
of
bittering
hops
balanced
as
expected
from
an
english
brewery
with
the
malts
winning
overall
and
id
be
remiss
to
not
mention
that
samuel
smiths
has
yet
to
let
me
down
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
but
the
malt
character
is
solid
this
is
one
ive
had
several
times
and
when
looking
for
something
authentic
its
a
go
to
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
simple
straightforward
brown
ale
exemplar
of
the
english
brown
ale
style
outstanding
beer
the
texture
was
incredible
find
some
now
for
yourself
o
a
solid
easily
drinkable
english
brown
nothing
earthshattering
i
prefer
more
malt
flavors
and
a
thicker
body
personally
but
solid
the
appearance
is
what
it
is
nut
brown
ale
being
a
nubeit
looked
like
i
invisioned
hoping
it
wasnt
going
to
look
dirty
and
it
didnt
robust
dark
wood
color
with
a
smoked
hickory
smell
but
also
fruity
sweet
smell
too
the
taste
expecting
to
be
kinda
of
bitterbut
not
at
allnor
dry
refreshing
zesty
fruity
tastemalty
and
at
the
end
another
sweet
taste
kinda
of
honey
not
sure
whatbut
very
good
i
loved
this
beer
o
very
well
done
brown
ale
tastes
like
it
would
pair
with
a
lot
of
foods
quite
well
its
a
solid
beer
which
i
believe
promises
more
than
it
delivers
the
nuttiness
is
present
but
not
as
prominent
as
i
feel
it
should
have
been
and
i
prefer
my
brown
ales
with
more
body
higher
mashing
temperature
and
some
brown
malt
would
benefit
this
ale
in
my
opinion
o
a
wellmade
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
the
butterscotch
aroma
and
creaminess
is
awesome
the
beer
even
got
better
as
it
warmed
a
bit
i
liked
this
one
and
wish
i
had
tried
it
sooner
will
have
to
try
some
more
beers
from
this
brewery
as
well
theres
a
reason
that
this
beer
is
the
benchmark
for
the
northern
english
brown
style
its
an
excellent
beer
i
dont
think
much
more
needs
be
said
o
delicious
beer
with
excellent
flavor
and
feel
will
definitely
enjoy
another
of
these
nice
brew
oh
well
o
pretty
good
nutty
brown
not
exactly
a
fan
or
expert
with
brown
ales
but
this
is
a
good
ale
in
its
own
right
from
the
12
flo
oz
bottle
this
is
the
brown
ale
that
brewers
emulate
when
they
brew
a
brown
ale
the
pour
is
a
clean
mahoganybrown
with
a
delicate
thin
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
nuttiness
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
crisp
clean

overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
the

i
really
like
this
brewery
and
this
beer
is
highly
recommended
o
great
beer
to
drink
a
few
of
while
staying
entertained
by
it
man
this
beer
gets
better
and
better
as
it
warms
its
a
must
try
for
all
considering
the
price
drinkability
and
accessibility
of
this
brown
ale
you
have
no
excuse
the
beer
is
brown
with
a
foamy
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
cap
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
web
like
lacing
smells
of
bread
hay
and
perhaps
slightly
medicinal
tastes
perfectly
balanced
of
rye
bread
butter
grass
and
coffee
more
of
a
harty
beer
this
beer
is
food
fantastic
overall
i
guess
i
really
am
a
sucker
for
brown
ales
and
this
one
will
be
the
beer
i
use
to
grade
all
other
brown
ales
from
here
on
out
a
really
wonderful
beer
you
must
try
o
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
the
best
respresentation
of
this
beer
seems
a
bit
uncharacteristic
of
other
reviews
but
for
what
it
is
worth
it
is
okay
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
tastes
are
subtle
they
start
with
the
typical
english
ale
fruitiness
maybe
some
plum
or
grape
followed
by
a
touch
of
almond
nothing
overbearing
a
straightforward
example
of
the
style
and
another
solid
offering
from
samuel
smiths
overall
this
is
good
fare
and
far
more
accessible
than
many
of
its
peers
drinkers
unfamiliar
with
the
style
will
find
this
nut
brown
ale
easy
to
quaff
also
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
this
is
amazingly
better
at
room
temp
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
is
deep
in
the
roots
of
what
is
a
british
beer
really
well
made
but
nothing
spectacular
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
is
easy
drinking
and
not
too
overpowering
while
having
subtle
complexity
overall
this
was
and
still
is
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
it
might
be
a
5
for
me
if
it
had
a
more
vibrant
and
nutty
aroma
overallexcellent
beer
that
is
well
worth
every
penny
o
blows
newcastle
out
of
the
water
its
got
depth
of
flavor
and
a
full
body
i
like
it
550ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
almond
brown
with
offwhite
head
that
lasts
awhile
smells
sweet
almost
like
toffee
light
on
the
tongue
not
overly
complex
but
very
smooth
and
tasty
notes
of
burnt
nuts
light
hops
malts
and
toffee
it
is
not
overly
carbonated
which
i
enjoyed
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
even
if
it
is
slightly
less
complex
than
some
of
the
others
if
a
beer
is
skunked
dont
review
it
underwhelmed
by
this
highlypraised
beer
not
nutty
enough
for
me
or
just
not
in
the
right
vein
a
bit
of
a
dud
for
me
at
least
the
price
is
right
o
after
trying
this
and
the
imperial
stout
i
need
to
try
more
from
this
brewing
company
this
was
a
lovely
ale
with
a
good
deal
of
drinkablity
maybe
not
as
good
as
the
imperial
stout
but
thats
more
for
personal
preference
its
still
worth
it
just
to
smell
the
nice
flavors
it
has
to
offer
easy
drinking
and
very
approachable
and
full
of
flavor
lingering
finish
well
done
my
only
problem
is
it
went
down
too
easily
not
a
sipping
beer
unless
you
have
more
discipline
than
i
have
this
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
reddish
tinge
the
head
is
tan
in
color
fluffy
and
lasts
pretty
long
the
smell
is
sweet
caramel
malty
and
inviting
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
with
sweet
caramel
malts
up
front
and
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
the
best
nut
brown
i
have
had
overall
i
am
really
not
a
brown
ale
advocate
i
will
most
certainly
drink
it
reflect
on
it
happily
but
its
not
among
my
top
10
styles
i
reviewed
this
beer
as
competently
as
i
could
in
terms
of
style
its
a
solid
brown
ale
especially
if
you
like
nuttytoffee
flavors
that
said
i
dont
know
that
ill
be
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
its
fine
but
not
really
memorable
in
any
way
theres
just
something
about
the
nut
brown
that
turns
me
off
from
the
start
but
that
nose
man
anyway
the
beer
is
just
mediocre
at
best
oh
well
hopefully
we
will
only
have
a
couple
more
of
these
samuel

on
the
list

didnt
the

use

be
clear
drinkability
is
good
this
isnt
a

overpowering
brew

more
restrained
it
is
smooth
and
mild
which
is
true
to
a
good
nut
brown
ale
the
taste
seems
watered
down
at
first
but
the
flavors
show
themselves
and
the
complexity
as
the
drinker
familiarizes
hisherself
with
it
a
solid
example
of
a
nut
brown
ale
not
a
huge
fan
of
english
browns
but
i
am
trying
to
keep
it
from
skewing
my
review
overall
from
what
i
have
had
so
far
this
one
is

is

with
the

a
very

and
satisfying
beer
drinkability
is
good
the
beer
is
good
there
is
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
and
its
not
very
complex
it
is
tasty
however
not
overwhelming
in
hops
or
malts
but
does
provide
a
distinct
taste
it
is
very
drinkable
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
i
can
not
quite
figure
out
exactly
what
im
tasting
in
beer
but
im
not
complaining
its
definitely
an
ale
no
misleading
there
i
would
recommend
the
beer
for
you
i
used
to
drink
this
often
then
moved
away
from
brown
ales
as
my
hophead
nature
came
to
the
fore
if
as
the
brothers
say
brown
is
the
new
black
and
probably
the
best
english
brown
ive
had
apart

the

this
beer
is
very
drinkable
easy
to
enjoy
a
pint
just
about
anytime
this
one
is
very
easy
drinking
and
i
can
easily
polish
off
the
550ml
bottle
i
wish
i
had
more
it
poured
out
beautifully
the
head
didnt
last
too
long
though
it
smelled
quite
good
except
something
in
there
did
seem
a
bit
off
which
made
me
a
little
worried
that
it
was
going
to
be
skunky
however
upon
tasting
it
was
definitely
not
as
for
the
taste
you
know
when
when
cartoon
characters
fight
and
there
is
a
ball
of
dust
with
arms
and
legs
poking
in
and
out
well
thats
what
it
seemed
like
was
going
on
in
my
mouth
34
different
nutty
and
earthy
tastes
were
fighting
with
each
one
taking
its
turn
to
jut
out
and
show
its
flavor
all
in
fast
succession
multiple
different
tastes
going
on
at
once
but
they
worked
very
well
together
for
me
i
could
drink
a
few
in
one
night
but
it
seems
best
to
save
and
savor
with
only
one
per
night
overall
a
nice
and
very
drinkable
brown
ale
not
a
flavor
explosion
but
very
nicely
done
picked
this
up
at
a
fresh
harvest
store
in
nacogdoches
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
is
a
unique
brown
ale
to
me
in
both
taste
and
color
this
one
poured
from
the
bottle
with
plenty
of
creamy
foamy
head
that
dissolved
into
thin
lacing
the
color
is
great
a
deep
brown
almost
ruby
color
the
smell
is
definitely
diacetyl
strong
butterscotch
maybe
a
little
citrusy
this
thing
is
very
complex
on
the
taste
nutty
for
sure
chewy
very
filling
the
hops
come
through
at
the
end
to
end
with
a
crisp
note
i
could
drink
this
one
forever
beer
is
proof
that
god
loves
man
benjamin

from

stouts

i
will
have
to
sample
the
porter
as
i
only
drank
it
out
one
night
at
a
concert
at
the
downstairs
at
the
world
cafe
live
in
university
city
philadelphia
yes
a
nice
beer
selection
there
not
fitting
for
a
rating
after
having
multiple
60
minute
ipas
very
drinkable
could
probably
have
quite
a
few
over
a
couple
hours
it
doesnt
leave
me
craving
another
though
md
both
ok
i
dont
find
this
to
be
the
most
interesting
beer
so
i
would
have
to
force
myself
to
not
only
want
to
finish
an
entire
bottle
but
also
drink
more
than
1
there
is
nothing
really
offensive
about
it
though
d
23
in
any
one
setting
the
sweetness
does
it
in
for
me
i
prefer
to
to
be
killed
by
roughness
when
it
comes
to
brews
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
since
it
was
the
top
rated
brown
ale
however
i
was
a
bit
let
down
maybe
it
was
a
bad
batch
or
maybe
the
glass
i
poured
it
into
hadnt
been
cleaned
well
enough
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
25oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
forming
a
medium
12
inch
head
slight
spots
of
lace
along
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
slight
sweet
malts
and
raisins
not
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
very
much
the
same
very
light
sweet
malt
followed
by
a
lessthanpleasant
raisinprune
taste
medium
mouthfeel
easy
finish
and
low
alcohol
content
would
make
this
an
easy
session
ale
overall
i
must
have
had
a
bad
batch
because
this
was
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
i
expected
i
will
definitely
be
trying
this
brew
again
nice
appearance
thick
and
persistent
head
if
you
get
this
in
a
bottle
beware
because
it
fizzes
like
allgetout
aroma
is
simply
heavenly
with
strong
molasses
overtone
and
some
burnt
hints
taste
does
not
quite
match
the
aroma
but
i
did
let
the
bottle
sit
for
a
bit
before
drinking
the
flavor
is
very
good
malty
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
also
a
hint
of
sweetness
thick
smooth
it
is
a
delight
to
drink
mouthfeel
awesome
malty
body
with
some
caramel
and
the
hops
are
about
medium
with
a
great
balance
to
the
malt
earthy
nutty
and
besides
the
price
per
bottle
would
be
a
goto
beer
any
day
a
good
froth
on
the
palate
does
not
change
much
and
the
nuttines
comes
out
a
just
a
little
more
fist
ss
i
have
had
in
the
new
dark
brown
bottle
d
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
very
smooth
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
very
well
done
when
i
think
of
an
english
brown
this
is
the
beer
that
comes
to
mind
overall
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
somewhat
often
i
can
imagine
overlooking
some
of
the
subtle
flavors
if
someone
were
to
drink
it
too
quickly
in
fact
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
when
i
first
started
drinking
this
beer
combined
perhaps
with
the
beer
warming
up
there
was
a
lot
more
standing
out
there
is
a
certain
talent
in
knowing
how
to
drink
beer
i
guess
so
drinkable
i
really
loved
this
beer
the
nut
flavors
are
delicious
taste
is
like
fresh
baked
whole
grain
bread
there
is
a
nice
nutty
flavor
there
is
a
touch
of
sweet
brown
sugar
and
just
a
tad
of
hops
pretty
well
balanced
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
pleasantly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
for
sure
a
classic
brown
ale
and
one
that
originally
turned
me
onto
the
style
poured
from
a
550ml
bottle
into
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
frothy
one
finger
head
with
light
lacing
the
initial
smell
is
of
nuts
and
hops
and
the
first
taste
shares
that
with
additions
of
caramel
and
a
light
toast
taste
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
seemingly
no
warming
behind
it
with
little
feel
of
carbonation
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
the
beer
opens
up
with
a
fuller
body
and
fuller
warmth
than
the
first
taste
a
nice
buy
which
i
would
like
to
have
again
i
could
drink
this
again
and
again
overall
this
is
a
classic
nut
brown
with
awesome
flavor
the
flavors
are
bold
balanced
and
complex
a
personal
favorite
easily
one
of
the
best
nut
brown
ales
out
there
drinkability
ok
ive
never
had
it
happen
before
but
it
seems
ive
finally
encountered
a
skunked
sammy
smith
bottle
i
really
wish
there
was
a
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
so
i
could
see
just
how
long
this
has
been
sitting
disappointing
d
this
is
a
great
beer
very
easy
to
consume
and
enjoy
the
flavors
truely
a
great
brew
if
anything
the
clean
finish
makes
it
more
drinkable
very
good
i
think
there
is
a
faint
tast
of
apples
but
im
not
sure
hmm
the
appearance
rocks
but
im
not
getting
much
else
from
this
bottles
perhaps
it
needs
to
warm
up
not
so
much
this
ale
just
doesnt
come
alive
for
me
theres
a
nutty
caramel
malt
flavor
but
its
too
subtle
its
also
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
in
aroma
and
flavor
almost
like
sugar
was
added
i
can
imagine
this
might
be
better
by
cask
but
i
was
sold
a
bottle
alas
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
average
head
with
steady
lacing
smell
of
dark
malt
chocolate
hints
as
well
tastes
amazing
complex
and
full
just
a
great
beer
all
around
i
can
drink
this
stuff
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
or
winter
day
or
night
best
part
is
that
it
is
easy
to
get
my
hands
on
and
is
relatively
inexpensive
comments
another
hit
from
samuel
smiths
this
may
be
one
of
my
faves
alongside
the
oatmeal
imperial
stouts
d
very
flavorful
beer
follow
this
one
with
a
porter
or
a
stout
d
its
smooth
and
sweet
finish
along
with
the
touch
of
nut
flavor
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
for
a
long
time
overall
really
a
great
beer
i
know
i
could
have
a
couple
in
a
sitting
d
a
good
brown
ale
but
not
the
best
offering
from
samuel
smiths
well
as
youd
expect
its
brown
it
has
a
very
nutty
aroma
interweaved
with
rich
sweet
malts
imagine
going
to
one
of
those
buffets
with
the
soft
serve
ice
cream
machine
and
filling
your
bowl
with
the
assorted
sticky
toppings
mixed
with
peanuts
it
also
has
a
little
alcohol
kick
at
the
end
of
each
sip
more
so
as
the
beer
gets
warmer
the
hops
keep
the
sweet
taste
in
check
from
being
too
sweet
and
it
makes
for
an
overall
pleasent
drinking
experience
pours
one
finger
head
tan
deep
brown
red
color
sweet
malty
odor
some
nuts
and
mild
spices
light
coffee
taste
is
mostly
nuts
and
malt
up
front
some
mild
spicy
hops
to
close
a
little
drying
a
good
amount
of
salt
okay
flavor
although
fairly
uneventful
given
the
stronger
aromas
carbonation
for
me
is
too
strong
definitely
overpowering
the
flavor
overall
an
okay
beer
but
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
samuel
smith
that
would
be
the
oatmeal
stout
id
definitely
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
although
not
sure
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
too
much
carbonation
too
little
flavor
poured
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
left
average
lacing
big
nose
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
mouthfeel
nice
and
rich
and
flavor
followed
he
nose
and
there
was
a
nice
bitter
finish
with
a
hint
of
hops
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
that
is
one
of
the
better
browns
i
have
seen
i
could
drink
this
brew
for
any
occasion
and
want
more
after
finishing
each
one
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
brew
which
if
just
wanted
to
sit
around
and
have
a
beer
is
the
one
i
would
choose
pours
dark
amber
with
two
finger
off
white
head
very
pleasent
malty
nutty
carmel
flavor
bitter
dry
finish
medium
body
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
in
others
words
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
in
my
opinion
sets
standard
for
this
style
drinkability
this
beer
is
refreshing
as
hell
very
light
flavors
but
nothing
bad
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
id
like
to
give
it
another
go
overall
this
is
just
what
i
expected
a
solid
nut
brown
with
many
redeeming
qualities
that
i
would
never
turn
down
in
a
social
setting
d
good
drinkability
very
enjoyable
sweetness
is
low
enough
that
i
could
go
for
3
or
4
of
these
brown
in
nature
brown
in
color
small
head
on
my
pour
cream
color
smells
sweet
and
malty
tastes
like
caramel
and
maybe
chocolate
nothing
here
tastes
nutty
to
me
carbonic
mouthfeel
light
on
the
tongue
but
more
on
the
back
upper
roof
of
the
mouth
almost
the
throat
drinkable
as
a
sipper
on
a
snowy
night
and
luckily
this
is
one
selected
for
such
an
occasion
and
pleased
with
the
choicesetting
will
investigate
other
smuel
smith
beers
jurys
still
out
here
i
really
like
this
not
so
distinguished
beer
the
classic
nut
brown
malt
chocolate
and
smoky
nut
flavors
while
this
may
be
a
bit
thin
for
the
purist
this
is
a
great
everyday
beer
with
a
good
combination
of
alcohol
bitterness
and
blend
of
ingredients
a
good
card
playing
brew
if
there
ever
was
one
good
malt
character
with
some
caramel
overtones
on
the
tongue
bitter
on
the
backend
sweet
throughout
with
linger
flavors
long
after
its
gone
d
really
a
very
nutty
beer
good
all
around
and
fun
to
drink
stylistic
accuracy
excellent
this
is
smooth
stuff
it
goes
down
so
easily
it
also
seems
to
satisfy
my
appetite
as
well
as
quench
my
thirst
for
me
this
is
one
of
those
complete
package
beers
it
tastes
and
smells
great
isnt
too
light
or
strong
and
can
be
enjoyed
any
time
this
is
the
first
brown
ale
i
tried
years
ago
and
none
other
has
been
able
to
compare
to
it
this
brown
ale
is
heavy
on
taste
and
everything
else
poured
a
dark
amber
with
generous
lacing
and
head
malt
aromas
dominate
while
some
roasted
characters
come
through
taste
was
sweeter
than
expected
but
well
rounded
out
by
the
cool
ale
profile
some
tree
nut
flavors
coem
from
slightly
roasted
malts
on
the
verge
of
chocolate
somewhat
sticky
on
the
mouth
and
heavier
than
most
brown
ales
but
very
flavorful
this
beer
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
lot
of
red
highlights
it
has
decent
off
white
head
which
laces
a
bit
the
smell
is
of
wood
biscuit
butterscotch
toasted
malt
hazelnut
walnut
and
hops
almost
a
bit
of
a
brandy
smell
in
there
too
the
taste
is
rich
maltiness
it
is
not
sweet
but
not
overly
bitter
either
the
nut
flavor
comes
through
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
for
a
brown
ale
rich
and
deep
with
medium
levels
of
carbonation
the
beer
leaves
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
drinkability
is
very
good
im
a
brown
ale
fan
to
begin
with
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
an
english
brown
should
be
normally
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
not
this
particular
beer
this
one
was
not
up
to
snuff
i
know
it
is
better
than
this
and
i
hope
to
review
a
fresher
one
soon
i
wouldnt
submit
this
review
at
all
but
samuel
smith
and
his
crew
need
to
be
taken
to
task
for
their
bottle
coloring
this
happens
way
to
often
i
was
also
recently
burned
by
a
heavily
oxidized
4pack
of
the
winter
welcome
shape
up
boys
or
people
will
start
thinking
your
beer
actually
does
taste
like
dollar
bills
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
decent
tan
head
leaving
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
almost
coffee
like
buttery
toffee
the
taste
is
of
toffee
roasted
malt
earthy
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
fizzy
no
bitter
aftertaste
a
bit
dry
this
beer
is
quite
good
nice
complex
flavors
great
balance
final
statment
a
quaffable
english
brown
ale
with
a
nice
flavour
and
not
too
heavy
i
recommend
this
with
some
pub
fare
d
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
on
the
planet
would
make
a
great
session
brew
also
would
pair
very
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
current
benchmark
for
the
brown
ale
style
well
done
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
brew
i
feel
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
would
make
a
great
brew
to
introduce
an
eager
novice
to
the
potentials
of
malts
darker
than
standard
macro
fare
ive
enjoyed
this
one
before
and
will
gladly
enjoy
it
again
drank
a
large
bottle
of
this
before
a
football
game
sunday
this
beer
pours
a
copperamber
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
nice
looking
smells
immediately
like
nuts
and
sugars
i
worried
it
may
actually
be
too
sweet
after
the
smell
wrong
it
as
a
nice
taste
some
nuts
and
a
slight
spice
with
a
mild
bitter
ending
this
one
has
a
strong
finish
leaving
an
aftertaste
that
you
do
not
want
to
wash
down
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
the
beer
would
benefit
greatly
from
a
brown
bottle
to
get
rid
of
that
odd
egg
note
but
other
than
that
the
beer
is
a
fine
mild
nut
brown
ale
returning
to
this
beer
after
over
two
years
its
apparent
that
sometimes
it
takes
experience
to
appreciate
a
simple
beer
like
this
one
back
then
i
didnt
know
what
to
think
but
now
i
appreciate
it
for
its
simplicity
it
is
exactly
what
it
should
be
however
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
i
didnt
find
this
beer
all
that
compelling
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
brownreddish
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
like
nuts
toasted
malt
and
caramel
it
tastes
the
same
way
to
me
except
that
theres
some
butterscotch
i
can
taste
along
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
overall
its
a
good
brown
ale
one
id
definitely
drink
again
note
one
of
the
craft
brews
ive
been
drinking
for
over
a
decade
so
this
one
gets
sentimental
points
from
me
mouthfeel
drinkability

not
much
hop
flavor
here
full
creamy
body
pleasant
sweetness
on
the
finish
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
nice
to
see
this
in
a
brown
bottle
now
pours
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
nice
tan
head
which
it
retains
quite
well
aroma
is
bread
like
malts
malty
nutty
flavor
with
some
roasted
malt
flavors
mild
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
nice
flavor
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
drinkability
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
the
flavor
it
has
makes
me
want
another
large
sip
as
soon
as
i
set
it
down
it
really
does
leave
a
lingering
flavor
of
fresh
nuts
ive
yet
to
have
a
brown
ale
that
can
beat
this
one
pours
a
very
deep
ruby
red
that
goes
brown
if
viewed
from
an
angle
perfectly
clear
and
with
a
big
and
frothy
mediumlight
tan
head
that
lasts
very
well
leaving
lots
of
thick
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
faint
light
roasted
malts
and
breadiness
a
hint
of
alcohol
mild
chocolate
and
hazelnut
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
light
caramel
and
breads
take
the
lead
not
much
else
slight
bitterness
rather
metallic
and
a
dry
finish
with
little
of
the
nuttiness
that
id
been
waiting
for
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
perhaps
a
bit
flat
and
drinkability
is
good
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
from
sam
smiths
im
a
big
fan
of
their
beers
but
this
is
rather
middling
and
doesnt
really
make
an
impression
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
from
a
brown
bottle
finally
hopefully
i
never
see
another
bottle
of
sam
smith
in
a
clear
bottle
the
beer
pours
with
a
tiny
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
as
i
empty
my
glass
and
fill
my
gut
the
aroma
is
minimal
with
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
honestly
not
much
there
in
terms
of
aroma
a
little
swirl
brings
out
some
more
sweet
malty
aroma
the
flavor
brings
on
more
sweet
malt
bread
some
roastiness
and
a
slight
acidity
mouthfeel
is
what
one
might
expect
in
a
brown
ale
not
terribly
heavy
but
not
light
either
this
one
goes
down
smooth
not
quite
silky
or
creamy
but
definitely
smooth
drinkable
yup
i
can
finish
a
bomber
without
much
effort
and
could
probably
down
another
overall
not
a
bad
beer
though
not
anything
id
deem
special
either
i
must
say
yay
for
brown
bottles
after
a
few
skunked
sam
smith
beers
id
resigned
to
only
buying
their
gift
boxes
to
get
the
nicely
protected
beer
inside
so
i
was
very
happy
to
see
that
they
had
switched
to
brown
bottles
this
one
definitely
doesnt
disappoint
another
fine
brew
from
sam
smith
no
element
of
nut
brown
ale
stands
out
as
being
wonderful
alternatively
there
are
no
flaws
all
the
flavors
compliment
each
other
and
are
modest
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
everyday
d
would
enjoy
another
especially
if
in
the
mood
for
an
english
brown
but
there
are
some
other
sam
smith
varities
id
prefer
nevertheless
a
quality
offering
pours
a
dark
deep
slightly
transparent
brown
with
small
off
white
head
smells
of
rich
toffee
hazelnut
and
almost
caramel
immediately
jump
from
this
beer
has
strong
nuttychocolatecaramel
flavors
with
a
rich
malt
finish
not
much
in
the
way
of
hoppiness
which
is
typical
of
a
nut
brown
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
sugary
in
the
palate
feeling
like
they
added
molasses
at
the
end
good
beer
nonetheless
notes
my
local
grocery
store
just
started
carrying
samuel
smiths
so
if
you
live
in
the
university
area
of
charlotte
nc
check
out
he
lowes
food
store
on
davis
lake
to
get
this
treat
dgood
a
solid
brown
ale
glad
i
bought
this
gift
pack
decent
beer
from
a
good
brewery
perhaps
it
is
the
old
style
of
brewing
but
this
just
has
way
too
much
diacetylbutterscotch
for
me
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
agian
a
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
brown
ale
overall
quite
drinkable
the
beer
has
a
nice
balance
that
will
not
offend
good
session
beer
also
goes
nice
with
a
variety
of
food
e
g
veal
burgers
etc
d
very
drinkable
not
too
strong
not
too
bold
not
too
weak
not
at
all
boring
great
beer
for
anytime
slainte
d
this
is
the
strong
point
of
this
one
for
me
easy
to
drink
being
neither
too
sweet
nor
dry
and
tasty
without
being
over
the
top
a
great
beer
and
certainly
one
of
the
pinnacles
of
the
english
brown
ale
style
a
nice
ale
one
id
definitely
get
again
pours
a
deep
rich
syrupyhoney
like
appearance
into
the
mug
with
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
perfect
of
a
light
sweetness
mixed
with
toffee
malts
syrup
and
nutty
flavors
the
taste
is
rich
and
pure
with
smoky
toffee
malts
and
just
a
slight
bit
of
bitterness
for
a
nice
balance
mild
in
the
mouth
with
good
crisp
balance
this
is
very
drinkable
you
have
to
be
careful
to
pace
yourself
so
that
you
can
enjoy
it
and
not
gulp
it
down
one
of
many
great
samuel
smith
brews
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
beer
very
good
beer
and
yet
another
great
product
from
samuel
smith
i
recommend
this
one
easy
to
drink
classic
english
session
ale
appearance
is
deep
brown
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
thick
tan
creamy
head
and
excellent
lacing
aromas
are
sweet
and
nutty
with
a
hint
of
toast
tastes
much
like
it
smells
big
toasty
nut
malt
flavor
up
front
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
worth
storing
in
my
memory
bank
as
solid
beer
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
semi
malty
aroma
with
a
white
head
that
would
have
been
bigger
if
i
didnt
fill
my
pint
glass
to
the
brim
a
solid
standard
for
this
style
of
beer
medium
bodied
biscuity
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
another
beer
that
makes
me
reevaluate
the
need
for
extreme
beers
sometimes
simple
is
just
as
enjoyable
i
just
noticed
that
this
is
my
50th
review
and
im
glad
that
i
had
such
a
fascinating
beer
on
this
mildly
important
occasion
cheers
very
sharp
and
crisp
this
is
one
fine
brew
from
the
lads
across
the
pond
pity
the
importing
raises
the
price
of
this
drinker
to
2
50
for
a
12
0z
brew
this
would
be
a
great
session
brew
at
810
dollars
for
a
sixer
this
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
small
but
persistent
head
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
definite
hazelnut
characteristic
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
slightly
chewy
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
appropriate
on
most
occasions
a
personal
favorite
overall
this
is
quite
a
darn
good
little
brown
ale
it
paired
quite
well
with
my
extra
sharp
cheddar
i
love
the
nutty
character
it
has
that
rides
with
the
very
mellow
bready
malt
character
definitely
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
or
similar
note
to
self
ranked
1
english
brown
ale
when
i
tried
it
550
ml
clear
bottle
orangetinted
chestnut
with
an
impressive
undulating
sandy
foam
cap
very
nice
head
retention
slowlyrising
sparse
carbonation
an
earthy
and
toasted
character
forms
the
base
of
the
aroma
but
im
surprised
to
detect
a
considerable
amount
of
leafy
and
grassy
smelling
hops
a
sweetish
hazelnut
aroma
appears
as
well
unfortunately
i
dont
pick
up
any
of
the
famed
nuttiness
of
this
ale
in
the
flavor
at
first
more
than
anything
i
taste
slightly
sour
doughy
malts
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
bracing
finish
of
hardasnails
burton
water
however
as
the
beer
warms
the
soft
nuttiness
slowly
emerges
as
does
a
demure
leafy
hop
flavor
greatly
improves
as
it
warms
lesson
learned
dont
chill
this
beer
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
velvety
smooth
after
more
time
a
pleasant
fruitiness
comes
through
in
the
flavor
when
served
properly
i
e
only
slightly
cool
this
is
a
fine
sessionable
ale
my
guess
is
that
this
one
must
be
outstanding
from
a
cask
d
drinkable
if
not
particularly
complex
solid
beer
i
did
this
in
a
side
by
side
comparison
with
sweetwaters
sweet
georgia
brown
they
are
very
similar
but
i
think
the
sgb
is
slightly
better
and
then
when
you
compare
the
price
7
for
6
of
sgb
compared
to
9
for
4
of
the
sam
smith
sgb
is
the
clear
winner
but
this
is
one
i
would
still
pick
up
from
time
to
time
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
malt
character
to
it
the
interesting
malt
tapestry
that
this
beer
weaves
is
its
selling
point
it
is
quite
easy
drinking
and
i
am
enjoying
it
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
oomph
or
even
a
bit
more
character
not
bad
and
certianly
a
touch
better
than
the
pale
ale
from
the
same
brewery
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
nicely
carbonated
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
definetly
a
session
beer
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
picked
one
up
at
half
time
in
ny
pours
a
beautiful
brown
and
the
smell
is
sweet
with
hints
of
nuts
toffee
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
with
a
small
foamy
white
head
the
taste
is
sweet
it
goes
down
smooth
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
but
would
probably
take
a
brookln
brown
over
it
pours
brownmaroon
with
excellent
clarity
two
and
a
half
finger
pale
biege
head
sinks
to
one
finger
of
dense
soap
bubbles
and
holds
well
leaves
light
spotty
lacing
toasted
pale
malt
and
crystal
nose
nutty
aroma
is
prominent
with
faint
english
hops
in
the
background
sweet
crystal
malt
flavor
some
pale
malt
and
roasted
chestnuts
the
semidry
aftertaste
presents
appropriate
fuggles
flavor
and
just
enough
hop
bitteness
to
keep
the
mild
diacetyl
note
a
pleasent
accent
in
the
overall
tone
low
carbonation
and
mediumlow
body
very
smooth
with
an
unrivaled
drinkability
mild
finish
lingering
malt
sweetness
but
nonresidual
and
a
balancing
herbal
hop
character
this
the
first
beer
that
comes
to
mind
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
and
also
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
can
think
of
i
loved
the
way
this
beer
looked
a
very
nice
dark
red
color
with
a
little
head
from
the
pour
just
beautiful
the
smell
wasnt
overwhelming
to
me
and
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
much
out
of
it
which
left
me
a
little
disappointed
that
disappointment
was
gone
once
i
got
a
taste
of
this
though
i
could
definitely
see
why
this
beer
was
called
a
nut
brown
ale
you
can
definitely
taste
some
roasted
nuts
along
with
some
other
fairly
sweet
undertones
combine
that
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
you
get
a
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
more
often
in
summary
an
excellent
representation
of
a
nut
brown
by
far
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
ive
been
impressed
with
other
nut
brown
ales
before
as
well
as
other
samuel
smith
beers
but
this
is
exceptional
great
smell
great
taste
etc
definitely
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
if
you
like
darker
ales
and
a
bit
of
hops
too
cheers
a
nice
brown
ale
will
have
to
rereview
it
and
hope
for
a
better
bottle
next
time
pours
a
very
dark
clear
copper
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
nutty
aroma
with
malt
and
caramel
taste
starts
out
sweet
and
finishes
dry
and
nutty
there
are
also
some
caramel
and
buttery
flavors
as
well
in
there
this
is
truly
a
delicious
beer
i
really
enjoy
dry
malty
brews
and
this
one
sure
does
not
dissapoint
very
good
beer
all
around
quite
sessionable
too
overall
an
excellent
beer
very
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
only
they
would
do
away
with
the
clear
glass
bottle
pours
a
clear
and
very
dark
brownamber
with
a
small
but
persistant
slightly
offwhite
head
aroma
is
heavy
nutty
and
malty
flavor
starts
with
sweet
malt
and
finishes
a
bit
nutty
with
some
dry
spicy
hop
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
with
heavy
carbonation
quite
smooth
very
nice
flavor
but
is
a
little
heavy
to
be
very
drinkable
eric
drinkability
yes
it
goes
down
easily
but
for
me
personally
im
just
not
that
into
the
taste
so
im
not
going
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
overall
i
would
rate
this
beer
as
a
great
session
beer
one
that
i
would
definately
drink
again
but
again
one
that
i
could
not
drink
all
the
time
lest
i
get
spoiled
on
the
taste
overall
impression
solid
brew
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
samuel
smiths
and
their
nut
brown
in
particular
finally
coming
back
around
to
review
it
i
can
see
why
wonderful
balance
that
lets
each
taste
come
through
simple
and
clean
an
easy
session
beer
nice
to
come
back
to
visit
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
bascially
a
standard
defining
for
its
style
it
is
palebrown
in
appearance
slight
head
smell
is
kind
of
sweet
and
carmely
the
taste
well
all
i
have
to
say
about
it
is
sweet
nutty
goodness
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
a
weak
point
lower
carbonation
not
really
watery
but
something
like
that
quite
drinkable
a
good
inbetween
season
beer
a
fantastic
english
brown
ale
kind
of
expensive
but
worth
the
cost
drinkability
is
above
ave
this
is
an
anytime
beer
quench
your
thirst
wash
down
a
meal
or
just
savor
the
flavors
slowly
in
your
big
chair
drinkability
is
high
its
a
good
thing
this
comes
in
a
550
ml
bottle
because
just
one
12
oz
serving
wouldnt
be
enough
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
definitely
one
of
my
long
time
favorites
for
the
style
i
plan
to
continue
drinking
this
one
whenever
the
chance
comes
along
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
and
next
time
i
might
not
share
d
this
beer
had
a
good
strong
nutty
flavor
which
many
nut
brown
ales
lack
that
was
a
very
nice
part
of
the
beer
but
there
were
some
slight
off
flavors
in
the
toasted
malt
and
i
dont
think
the
clear
glass
bottles
helped
d
the
definition
of
a
flavorful
session
beer
low
alcohol
good
carbonation
level
clean
finish
mmm
overall
a
tasty
brown
ale
that
slighty
pulls
its
punches
youll
not
be
disappointed
very
nutty
taste
upfront
followed
by
outstanding
hops
character
this
is
a
nice
nutty
brown
ale
my
only
problem
with
it
is
it
is
way
overpriced
9
bucks
for
4
beers
at
5
is
outrageous
i
dont
mind
paying
that
amount
for
belgians
or
a
great
dipa
but
enough
of
that
this
beer
is
good
but
a
little
boozy
considering
the
low
alcohol
content
whiskyish
finish
and
very
dry
a
good
beer
overall
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
reddish
hues
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
creamy
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
thin
layer
of
lacing
that
covers
the
whole
glass
the
aroma
is
of
milk
chocolate
caramel
with
a
touch
of
samuel
smiths
house
aroma
but
not
as
much
of
it
as
other
sameul
smith
beers
the
taste
is
well
it
is
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
aroma
the
caramel
and
the
house
taste
are
still
there
but
the
chocolate
isnt
the
mouthfeel
is
what
would
be
expected
from
a
brown
ale
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
might
not
be
the
best
brown
ale
in
the
world
but
it
is
damn
good
nonetheless
a
credit
to
its
style
and
a
beer
that
screams
attention
for
its
being
mmmm
i
love
finding
a
sam
smiths
beer
without
their
trademark
scentflavor
that
licorice
or
herbal
quality
this
is
definitely
missing
that
and
benefits
from
being
without
it
poured
a
crystal
clear
deep
mahagony
color
with
large
creamy
tannish
head
attractive
lacing
as
the
head
slowly
fell
to
a
thin
surface
coating
smell
is
extremely
nice
with
strong
notes
of
ripe
fruit
caramel
toffee
and
toasted
malt
very
pleasant
mixture
taste
is
slightly
malty
with
a
bit
of
caramel
suprisingly
dry
with
a
very
strong
bitterness
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
but
too
much
hoppiness
and
bitterness
for
my
liking
it
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
little
red
a
big
frothy
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
nutty
and
malty
just
as
one
might
expect
the
taste
really
cant
get
much
better
wellrounded
flavors
and
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
it
had
sufficient
body
and
a
decently
long
finish
very
enjoyable
drinkability
excellent
flavor
although
a
bit
stiff
tasting
in
terms
of
alcohol
rich
nuttiness
accumulates
on
the
tongue
producing
a
finer
and
finer
taste
not
at
all
filling
superb
this
beer
poured
with
a
thick
frothy
head
it
is
a
deep
rown
color
the
smell
is
of
similar
to
coffee
with
cream
the
taste
is
a
little
sharp
for
a
brown
ale
there
is
a
lingering
bitterness
not
too
bad
though
the
drinkability
is
fair
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
this
one
is
mid
pack
i
could
drink
again
if
need
be
overall
an
average
brew
mouthfeel
is
nice
full
and
creamy
very
smooth
and
drinkable
also
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
by
far
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
before
you
jump
on
that
sam
smith
is
in
a
clear
bottle
and
should
be
boycotted
wagon
consider
this
i
have
never
had
a
skunked
bottle
this
one
was
no
different
a
very
sexy
beer
in
my
opinion
a
nice
dark
brown
body
still
tansparent
and
all
and
a
really
thick
creamy
tan
head
on
top
i
poured
it
into
my
favorite
imperial
pint
with
just
enough
head
to
allow
the
aroma
to
form
smells
grassy
and
nutty
i
love
the
taste
of
this
one
very
well
balanced
and
an
excellent
kick
of
nutty
aroma
i
get
a
lot
of
vanilla
type
flavors
and
something
i
best
describe
as
butterscotch
it
has
a
syrupy
body
a
very
nice
beer
to
just
chill
out
with
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
aroma
was
a
difficult
one
to
judge
as
i
am
a
little
congested
from
allergies
right
now
but
it
seemed
to
be
a
quite
mild
aroma
on
the
malty
side
flavor
was
good
with
that
usual
samuel
smiths
aftertaste
in
the
swallow
a
good
english
brown
ale
with
a
dryness
in
the
finish
that
enhances
the
drinkability
with
no
real
offending
trademarks
a
pleasant
flavor
and
mouthfeel
low
abv
and
fairly
wide
availability
this
can
only
be
considered
easily
drinkable
very
straightforward
brown
ale
that
doesnt
leave
much
for
the
imaginative
drinker
to
interpret
but
thats
cool
it
is
what
it
is
drinkabilitymouthfeel
this
beer
is
really
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
balanced
in
terms
of
malt
and
hops
and
have
a
wonderful
finish
its
not
one
i
pick
up
too
often
but
when
i
do
i
am
always
happy
i
havent
had
a
ny
samuel
smith
products
in
like
forever
this
is
what
a
nut
brown
ale
should
taste
like
its
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
some
nice
lacing
it
has
a
chocolate
malt
odor
and
a
coffee
taste
with
a
small
bit
of
hoppiness
good
body
not
thin
tasting
very
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
it
is
a
bit
to
bitter
for
my
taste
but
i
would
say
it
is
certainitly
average
as
far
as
drinkablitly
very
drinkable
certainally
had
better
nutbrowns
but
this
was
my
first
still
shines
as
great
example
of
the
style
id
drink
it
again
but
probably
rather
try
some
other
brown
ales
mouthfeeldrinkability
disappointingly
mundane
in
that
the
carbonation
is
too
weak
to
keep
the
beer
exciting
it
is
consistent
not
dying
off
into
nothing
but
a
boring
kind
of
consistent
for
an
english
brown
is
drinks
easily
and
the
low
abv
promotes
session
drinking
aroma
is
fairly
strong
with
heavy
malt
sweetness
nuts
and
caramel
almost
make
this
smell
like
desert
medium
body
with
a
fairly
carbonated
mouthfeel
goes
down
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
toward
the
end
taste
is
sweet
nutty
toasted
malt
with
a
bitter
dose
of
hops
to
balance
things
out
lots
of
flavor
and
depth
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
not
too
sweet
like
american
browns
tend
to
be
i
like
this
beer
for
its
great
appearance
and
bold
flavor
another
great
offering
from
tadcaster
is
this
the
best
premium
brewery
out
there
the
beer
pours
a
clear
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
14
inch
head
that
lingers
in
the
glass
and
leaves
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
too
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
caramelly
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
i
could
taste
a
light
hop
bitterness
this
beer
was
smooth
on
the
palate
and
quite
drinkable
it
reminds
me
of
a
stronger
english
mild
quite
tasty
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
head
that
diminished
but
a
good
portion
of
it
stuck
around
the
whole
time
a
good
amount
of
lacing
also
an
excellent
flavor
nuttymalty
ever
so
slightly
fruity
not
too
heavy
and
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
nothing
special
but
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
that
i
could
drink
year
round
very
pleased
and
will
definately
buy
again
appeared
a
dark
rust
color
in
my
pint
glass
with
a
soft
offwhite
colored
head
that
left
quickly
and
left
behind
some
lacing
low
level
of
carbonation
is
present
aromas
of
pine
nuts
peanuts
and
fruit
juice
seemed
apparent
to
me
the
taste
was
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
expected
with
fruity
undertones
that
contrasted
nicely
with
the
bitter
flavors
in
the
beer
relatively
thin
in
my
mouth
without
a
comprehensive
texture
or
feel
a
bit
sour
in
the
aftertaste
i
had
one
of
these
and
thats
all
i
wanted
for
quite
awile
this
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
with
a
nice
frothy
off
white
head
that
dissapates
but
leaves
a
thin
film
for
a
while
which
eventually
dissipates
the
smell
is
priarily
roasted
nutty
malts
with
hints
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
the
spotlight
of
the
beer
the
taste
here
is
primarily
hazlenut
roasted
malts
this
is
a
fantastic
flavor
in
a
brown
ale
there
is
a
good
thickeness
here
with
a
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
i
would
certainly
prefer
rogues
hazlenut
brown
nectar
but
other
than
that
brown
ales
do
not
get
much
better
than
this
mouthfeel
is
mid
bodied
and
lively
perhaps
just
a
tiny
bit
thick
this
is
a
light
playful
but
still
very
complex
beer
i
could
drink
gallons
of
notes
i
will
have
to
hook
up
my
friends
with
this
one
when
they
come
up
to
visit
this
is
the
standard
for
brown
ales
everywhere
while
this
is
a
good
beer
and
perhaps
the
standard
by
which
many
brewers
judge
their
own
brown
nutbrown
ales
it
certainly
doesnt
reach
out
and
seduce
me
this
is
more
of
your
casual
sipping
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
lazy
evening
drinkability
suffers
a
little
in
this
respect
this
my
friends
is
my
favorite
beer
samuel
smith
does
not
disappoint
this
beer
pours
an
amber
or
chestnut
color
with
foamy
off
white
head
smells
of
floral
sweetness
undertones
of
malts
sweet
grape
smells
and
bits
of
butterscotch
clean
malty
tastes
with
a
buttery
taste
there
is
still
a
dryish
sweetness
to
this
beer
that
reminds
me
of
grapes
medium
body
with
earthy
tastes
and
an
aftertaste
that
is
dry
and
a
little
bitter
very
drinkable
beer
and
right
on
the
spot
for
a
nut
brown
slightly
dry
creamy
smooth
and
very
drinkable
one
wont
be
enough
i
had
two
in
about
15
minutes
it
was
good
not
my
favorite
nut
brown
ale
but
im
also
starting
to
think
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
well
made
and
decent
but
not
top
notch
for
me
extremely
drinkable
possibly
addictive
extremely
easy
to
drink
this
beer
for
any
one
who
likes
brown
ales
or
wants
to
develop
a
greater
appreciate
for
the
style
you
cant
afford
to
pass
this
one
up
its
not
the
best
brown
ale
out
there
but
it
is
widely
considered
a
classic
and
is
at
least
my
opinion
the
example
to
which
all
others
of
the
style
should
be
compared
recommended
opinion
i
am
a
pretty
big
fan
of
sam
smiths
beers
but
this
particular
one
is
not
my
favorite
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
too
light
for
the
water
and
ingredients
they
use
i
believe
that
the
water
has
something
to
do
with
the
harsh
flavor
you
get
from
this
beer
i
prefer
to
stick
to
sam
smiths
darker
beers
overall
another
wonderfully
pleasant
samuel
smith
offering
and
one
ill
keep
drinking
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
sam
smith
especially
the
nonstout
sam
smiths
once
you
get
used
to
the
yeast
character
at
least
that
is
what
i
think
i
am
tasting
with
the
must
it
is
great
really
grows
on
you
d
a
nice
beer
to
drink
both
as
a
session
quaffer
and
one
that
has
enough
going
on
to
make
you
want
to
sip
very
balanced
smooth
and
drinkable
an
almost
flawless
nut
brown
delicious
a
very
good
nut
brown
ale
a
little
better
than
newcastle
but
the
difference
is
not
huge
in
my
opinion
pours
with
a
thin
wispy
white
head
nose
is
malty
accented
with
overtones
of
toffee
and
caramel
the
same
characteristics
follow
through
in
the
taste
hops
are
in
the
background
here
the
big
maltiness
takes
the
lead
role
here
toffee
caramel
a
bit
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
but
fits
the
style
well
a
tasty
nut
brown
ale
thats
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
smell
is
quite
nutty
and
slightly
roasty
as
compared
to
say
newcastle
also
has
a
bit
of
the
sweet
buttery
toffee
aroma
that
seems
to
be
a
trademark
british
flavor
particularly
with
brown
ales
the
taste
is
very
much
the
same
adding
a
small
bit
of
a
caramel
flavor
to
the
toffee
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
of
the
english
variety
perhaps
a
fresher
sample
would
favor
a
better
offering
not
bad
though
finish
did
it
for
me
somewhat
this
was
a
slightly
above
average
brown
it
has
some
interesting
characteristics
that
do
bring
to
mind
the
more
english
style
which
this
most
certainly
is
i
think
that
this
is
the
cookie
cutter
for
nut
brown
ales
this
is
the
one
other
breweries
base
their
beers
on
this
one
if
you
arent
sure
what
a
nut
brown
should
be
give
this
a
go
and
dont
be
surprised
if
you
fall
in
love
good
stuff
d
very
drinkable
moderately
full
body
carbonation
would
prohibit
the
consumption
of
multiple
gallons
pours
a
bronzish
color
which
has
ruby
delicate
ruby
tones
in
the
light
head
is
high
and
lasts
with
sticky
lacing
everywhere
taste
is
oh
so
nice
hitting
the
mouth
with
a
surprising
and
delightful
milkiness
which
is
uncommon
in
a
beer
that
looks
like
this
one
taste
is
spot
on
for
the
style
smooth
rich
and
full
of
complex
flavor
components
ranging
from
strong
cinnamon
type
spices
to
malty
butterscotch
and
definitely
nuts
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
definitely
reccomend
trying
this
a
bit
warmer
than
normal
because
it
really
allows
the
depth
of
the
flavors
to
be
on
display
probably
a
bit
rich
to
sit
and
make
a
night
of
this
beer
but
the
first
one
goes
down
so
fast
that
youll
have
to
drink
at
least
one
or
five
more
a
fantastic
example
of
the
syle
a
superior
brew
as
is
expected
from
this
brewery
which
almost
never
seems
to
miss
the
mark
had
this
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
in
fort
worth
appearance
was
good
deep
brown
with
some
red
highlights
and
a
nice
foamy
head
with
a
few
minutes
of
staying
power
aroma
is
sweet
and
nutty
hazelnut
maple
syrup
malt
perhaps
a
bit
of
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
taste
is
a
bit
syrupy
with
definite
nuttyness
i
would
say
mostly
hazelnut
or
chestnut
some
dark
spices
floating
on
top
of
a
yeasty
undercurrent
a
bit
lighter
than
one
would
think
in
the
mouth
somewhat
overcarbonated
maybe
because
it
was
ontap
i
could
have
one
of
these
but
its
not
something
i
would
like
to
drink
several
of
goes
down
easy
a
little
to
easy
i
like
this
much
better
than
all
the
other
nut
brown
ales
ive
tried
im
actually
pissed
that
i
split
the
bottle
with
my
wife
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
to
date
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
this
beer
is
more
filling
than
i
would
have
guessed
not
my
favorite
style
at
all
but
certainly
not
a
bad
brew
if
you
like
newcastle
try
this
this
is
my
first
reveiw
of
a
beer
all
and
all
i
have
to
say
it
tastes
much
like
most
brown
ales
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
it
is
drinkable
but
so
are
all
brown
ales
i
gave
it
an
average
rateing
because
nothing
deffertiates
this
beer
from
the
others
ive
tried
although
until
recently
my
experience
has
been
whofully
limited
i
can
honestly
i
dont
yet
understand
all
the
terms
that
most
of
you
use
but
it
looks
a
dark
brown
amber
in
the
glass
it
smells
like
it
tastes
its
bitter
when
it
first
touches
the
tongue
and
then
becomes
smother
the
longer
its
held
there
as
for
drinkability
i
would
choose
this
before
some
but
after
some
please
bare
with
my
reveiws
as
i
am
new
to
this
overall
this
is
above
average
but
nothing
really
to
talk
about
reminds
me
of
many
other
brown
ales
and
doesnt
have
enough
to
push
it
above
the
pack
drinkability
if
someone
offered
me
this
beer
i
would
not
refuse
its
a
nice
nutty
earthy
beer
but
the
beautiful
color
raises
your
expectations
only
to
dissapoint
with
an
average
taste
edit
this
is
absolutely
divine
with
gruyere
this
would
effect
the
taste
and
how
it
pours
always
does
pours
great
does
not
have
much
to
any
head
and
with
some
bubbles
at
the
end
of
each
bottle
the
stone
effect
would
also
awsomely
increase
the
flavor
and
tastes
as
well
for
as
samuel
smiths
but
brown
does
still
remain
one
of
the
bests
not
a
session
brew
but
a
very
good
and
malty
brown
ale
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
fairly
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
nicely
drinkable
but
for
8
i
felt
a
bit
disappointed
to
be
sure
drinkability
sure
its
easy
drinking
but
im
just
not
thrilled
by
it
while
i
would
not
hesitate
to
have
the
oatmeal
stout
this
one
i
will
not
rush
out
to
get
again
somewhat
disappointed
by
it
smells
light
aley
and
deliscious
almost
nutty
very
enticing
the
head
is
tightly
and
loosely
bubbled
at
the
same
time
with
an
offwhite
hue
and
it
lasts
quite
a
while
the
flavor
is
light
with
sweet
malt
and
light
but
present
hopping
somewhat
of
a
nutty
aftertaste
that
begs
you
take
another
sip
not
an
overly
complex
flavor
but
quality
recommended
still
a
good
beer
even
on
its
worst
days
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
impression
very
enjoyable
brew
very
distinctive
from
other
nut
browns
i
have
tried
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
full
and
easy
to
drink
hoppiness
reduces
overall
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
although
i
know
not
everyone
will
agree
man
this
is
the
epitome
of
what
a
good
nut
brown
ale
should
be
poured
out
to
a
brown
color
with
a
nice
13
inch
head
no
lacing
in
the
glass
mediumlow
carbonation
aromas
of
roasted
nuts
grain
toasted
malt
and
molassas
taste
was
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
few
unexpected
flavors
complexity
is
abound
flavors
of
nuts
hops
mild
malts
and
a
touch
of
butterscotch
sweetness
great
aftertaste
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
good
but
couldnve
been
a
bit
thicker
nonetheless
very
nice
all
around
high
drinkability
i
will
be
seeing
more
of
this
beer
recommended
d
excellent
this
is
what
good
beer
should
taste
like
complexity
on
the
palate
with
a
strong
but
not
overpowering
finish
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
all
night
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
nice
carbonation
small
head
a
little
bit
of
lacing
afterwards
from
a
clear
bottle
scents
of
malt
sweet
caramel
nice
taste
sweet
malty
and
nutty
medium
body
with
a
dry
finish
at
5
abv
would
make
a
good
session
brew
the
clear
bottle
throws
me
off
pours
a
very
deep
ruby
red
colour
an
average
offwhite
head
quickly
settles
and
laces
the
glass
like
a
champ
all
the
way
down
smells
of
sweet
maltiness
with
caramel
and
faint
traces
of
coffee
tastes
like
heaven
sweet
and
creamy
maltiness
up
front
is
gorgeously
followed
by
a
clean
and
dry
finish
absolute
luxurious
mouthfeel
smooth
as
a
babys
ass
and
smooth
as
all
hell
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
every
day
the
best
nut
brown
money
can
buy
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
one
of
the
best
brews
out
there
no
head
as
poured
at
bar
i
can
tell
this
is
going
to
be
a
redundant
review
for
poured
from
the
tap
is
pretty
similar
to
from
the
bottle
dark
brown
body
with
a
tan
head
toasted
malt
nose
flavor
is
sophisticated
toasted
malt
and
hops
with
good
bitterness
mouth
is
watery
leading
to
good
drinkability
theres
a
nice
bitter
finish
a
good
bitter
ale
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
nutty

good

brown
ale

to
a
dark
brown
color
reminiscent
of
cola
the
thick
creamy
head
helps
reinforce
that
image
the
nose
suggests
lightly
roasted
malt
and
the
palate
is
very
malty

somewhat
nutty
hence
the
name
with
a
unique
mushroomy
character
almost
akin
to
a
ringwood
ale
theres
a
touch
of
butter
albeit
a
light
one
and
a
surprisingly
fruity
finish
which
strongly
hints
at
melon
and
pear
a
light
toffee
character

subtle
roastiness
permeate
the

skunked
with

mellow
toasted

aroma
no
real
sweetness
is

the
flavor
is
okay
i
get
good
nutty
flavors
with
some
light
grapeskin
flavors
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
i
find
it
to
be
an
okay
brew
the
skunkyness
in
the
initial
aroma
was
not
all
that
nice
there
is
someting
in
the
flavor
that
is
not
doing
it
for
me
i
cant
place
it
but
its
a
little
harsh
on
the
finish
not
bad
not
great
after
drinking
a
lot
of
high
gravity
beers
lately
its
nice
to
have
a
lower
bodied
beer
with
the
roasted
complexity
well
brewed
matured
and
handled
beer
thats
more
easily
drinkable
and
less
alcoholic
the
look
is
of
solid
brown

deep
amber

and
flavors

good

barley
malt

roasted

toasted

roasted

bitter

with
the
lightest
hint
of

i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
little
more
caramel
malt
nutty
character
it
all
seemed
a
little
too
subtle
for
me
but
ive
found
this
to
be
the
case
with
most
of
the
british
ales
ive
tried
american
micros
just
tend
to
have
the
balls
to
try
new
and
exciting
things
in
old
traditional
styles
like
the
brown
ale
rather
drinkable
overall
but
nothing
phenomenal
here
there
are
certainly
more
interesting
american
examples
out
there
notes
sole
us
distributor
merchant
du
vin
after
completing
the
550ml
bottle
im
craving
more
this
is
truly
an
exceptional
beer
that
has
most
likely
taken
alot
of
timecarerespect
to
produce
from
the
way
it
starts
it
should
be
a
better
brew
most
of
the
beers
ive
had
from
sam
smith
seem
to
have
a
strangely
astringent
finish
ill
give
it
another
go
sometime
in
the
future
this
one
is
a
good
beer
i
found
myself
most
dissapointed
with
the
head
of
all
things
but
i
also
have
no
way
of
knowing
just
how
old
the
sample
i
acquired
from
the
store
is
because
the
bottle
lacked
a
drink
by
or
freshness
date
of
any
kind
the
taste
is
not
over
powering
and
neither
is
the
abv
too
high
i
could
find
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
at
sitting
if
the
mood
struck
me
a
very
enjoyable
beer
appearance
is
a
dark
mahogany
with
good
foam
and
lacing
aroma
is
indeed
nutlike
with
some
rich
scents
of
caramel
initial
taste
is
composed
of
creamy
smooth
yeast
balanced
by
bitter
hops
that
work
well
finish
leaves
a
pleasant
taste
on
the
tongue

dry
and
creamy
like
baileys
irish
cream
well
done
an
average
dark
brown
slightly
cloudy
brown
ale
did
have
a
pretty
even
white
head
and
excellent
lacing
smells
earthy
musty
dank
and
alcoholic
mostly
just
tastes
sweetly
alcoholic
though
its
called
a
nut
brown
ale
the
only
nuttiness
in
this
is
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
by
far
the
most
pleasant
part
of
my
experience
with
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
the
tommyknocker
imperial
nut
brown
but
that
at
least
had
a
10
abv
to
explain
its
unpleasantness
i
really
dont
understand
why
this
is
rated
so
highly
apparently
i
just
dont
get
this
particular
kind
of
brown
ales
note
half
an
hr
later
i
developed
an
allergy
could
it
be
the
nuts
in
it
dunno
i
had
to
drink
more
beers
later
during
the
night
so
to
rest
assured
that
its
not
related
to
beer
in
general
still
this
was
ok
overall
more
drinkable
than
a
newcastle
but
nothing
id
seek
out
in
a
bar
drinkability
due
to
the
low
alcohol
content
this
would
make
a
good
session
drink
this
is
a
very
common
brown
ale
that
exerybody
should
try
and
something
that
i
would
buy
again
keep
up
the
good
work
samuel

overall

very
smooth
easy

a

color
that
kinda
looks
like

its
topped
with
a
1
inch
tan
head
that
keeps
a
thin
blanket
throughout
but
doesnt
leave
lace
on
the
glass
sweet

and
hops
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
sweet

even

the

leave
a
nice
bitterness
and
leafyfloral
flavors
it
has
a
medium
body
and
very
nice
carbonation
wow
it
is
complex
and
delicious
constantly
reminding
me
of
the
flavors
in
rochefort
10
ive
had
this
once
before
but
it
wasnt
near
this
good
i
think
the
first
one
may
have
had
some
skunk
due
to
the
clear
bottle
i
had
this
beer
out
of
the
clear
bottle
the
beer
was
a
redbrown
and
smelled
sweet
with
a
nutty
tone
to
it
and
formed
a
decent
head
the
taste
was
very
nutty
the
carbonation
was
low
very
flavorful
but
with
little
emphasis
if
that
makes
any
sense
a
very
creamy
and
smooth
drink
not
very
crisp
but
quite
delicious
highly
recommended
i
was
very
impressed
with
my
first
samuel
smith
it
has
a
very
pleasant
smell
and
appearance
with
its
dark
brown
color
in
its
clear
glass
bottle
made
it
very
tempting
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
end
the
first
taste
is
of
a
well
brewed
ale
with
a
touch
of
roasted
almonds
and
brown
sugar
then
finishes
smoothly
with
alittle
spice
and
a
bit
of
bite
a
very
good
beer
for
the
winter
season
and
an
excellent
beer
to
ponder
it
is
available
in
a
case
of
twenty
four
or
a
four
pack
of
twelve
ounce
bottles
just
enough
beer
to
come
up
with
your
own
review
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
is
classic
beer
i
can
imagine
a
better
version
but
i
dont
know
that
ive
had
a
better
version
there
is
very
little
wrong
with
this
one
and
im
sorry
it
took
me
so
long
to
find
that
out
im
grateful
to
be
able
to
add
another
beer
to
the
depressingly
too
short
list
of
locally
available
worthies
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
a
darn
good
nut
brown
pours
a
deep
redbrown
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
sweet
and
nutty
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
upfront
fading
into
a
dry
hazelnut
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
with
a
rather
low
carbonation
level
this
is
as
good
of
a
english
brown
ale
ive
had
but
theres
just
something
about
the
style
that
comes
up
short
for
me
a
super
easydrinking
brown
ale
very
nice
session
beer
drinkability
is
ok
if
one
can
tolerate
the
slight
astringent
finish
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
not
too
bitter
and
not
too
heavy
actually
i
am
surprised
it
is
not
rated
higher
i
think
its
quite
good
smaller
clear

without
any
freshness
dating

a

sure
definately
something
one
should
have
around
at
all
times

dominating
and
an

smooth

even
a
buttery

drinkable
oh
hell
yes
ill
be
buying
this
beer
and
this
style
more
often
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
the
palate
clean
also
despite
the
looks
this
is
not
a
heavy
beer
and
seems
medium
to
light
bodied
drinkability
is
good
this
would
go
well
with
foods
but
i
dont
see
this
as
a
session
beer
as
the
flavour
would
grow
a
bit
weary
after
a
few
drinkability
nice
complex
flavors
make
it
wonderfully
drinkable
serving
it
too
cold
robs
it
of
most
of
its
good
flavors
and
complexity
it
sits
well
with
food
ss
nut
brown
is
dark
reddishbrown
with
an
averagesized
brown
head
head
is
creamy
and
has
above
average
retention
the
aroma
has
a
light
malty
sweetness
with
touches
of
nuttiness
and
spice
the
taste
has
the
malt
profile
of
a
good
brown
ale
with
a
subtle
nutty
flavor
hops
provide
just
a
tiny
hint
of
drying
and
spice
drinkability
is
great
however
i
was
expecting
more
from
samuel
smith
with
this
beer
and
i
was
hoping
that
nut
brown
would
be
more
robust
its
brown
alright
reddish
brown
auburn
a
decent
head
which
lingers
a
bit
then
leaves
a
bit
of
clottage
the
aromas
are
of
caramel
sweet
malts
a
flowery
grassy
note
nutty
of
course
or
toasted
grain
the
taste
is
simultaneously
clean
and
earthy
roasted
malt
and
a
pervasive
gentle
bitterness
yeasty
and
buttery
medium
bodied
and
smooth
it
all
works
together
to
deliver
a
heavenly
brew
session
beer
absolutely
medium
bodied
good
drinkability
pours
a
clear
dark
reddishbrown
with
small
and
slow
carbonation
bubbles
making
their
way
up
a
small
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
smells
of
zuchini
bread
with
a
whiff
of
cola
malty
taste
of
molasses
and
walnuts
with
a
very
pleasant
creamy
texture
medium
bodied
finish
of
a
light
coffee
bitterness
and
a
deep
nuttiness
the
beer
poured
a
robust
dark
amber
with
a
wonderful
ruby
glow
and
developed
a
small
tan
head
the
aroma
was
classic
samuel
smith
it
had
plenty
of
malt
and
hops
and
got
you
ready
for
what
was
to
come
the
taste
was
pretty
straightforward
and
again
classic
samuel
smiths
it
had
a
rich
malty
taste
up
front
with
just
a
dab
of
sweetness
to
it
then
rounded
out
into
a
nicely
balanced
hop
finish
that
small
sweet
kick
was
really
all
that
i
saw
different
between
the
nut
brown
and
the
tadcaster
ale
so
loving
the
one
i
had
to
love
the
second
in
fact
that
slight
difference
might
put
me
in
the
nut
brown
column
instead
of
the
taddy
it
had
a
nice
medium
body
to
it
and
as
usual
you
got
a
nice
quenching
and
satisfying
fullness
to
the
taste
and
feel
samuel
smith
consistently
delivers
really
quality
beers
that
you
can
truly
enjoy
the
taste
and
feel
show
excellence
in
both
the
brewing
and
the
ingredients
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
would
show
anyone
the
light
of
quality
beers
i
received
the
gift
box
containing
3
samuel
smith
beers
this
is
the
first
time
i
am
trying
this
brand
the
ale
poured
beautifully
into
the
pint
glass
provided
in
the
gift
set
a
nice
foamy
light
brown
head
not
a
huge
head
but
very
foamy
looking
if
that
makes
sense
a
very
woodyroasted
nut
smell
and
a
clean
pleasant
taste
a
decent
mouth
feel
but
almost
that
of
a
cold
soda
its
a
nice
beer
to
sip
but
not
to
drink
too
fast
the
head
disappears
rather
fats
and
leaves
a
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
but
maybe
not
one
i
would
go
searching
for
pours
chestnut
brown
with
red
hues
and
lots
of
frothy
tan
head
which
dimishes
rather
quickly
to
a
layer
of
bubbles
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
some
nuts
in
the
aroma
taste
is
very
nicely
balanced
with
the
sweet
malts
and
the
nutty
flavours
developing
to
a
nice
subtle
hopped
finish
not
too
overboard
on
the
nuts
which
is
good
considering
some
of
the
poorly
balanced
nut
browns
ive
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
overly
carbonated
for
my
palate
a
little
less
in
that
regard
maybe
bottleconditioned
could
be
an
improvement
all
in
all
a
tasty
pint
and
a
decent
brown
ale
from
sam
smith
pours
a
very
dark
copper
color
with
a
full
tan
rocky
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
smells
of
roasted
coffee
and
faint
hop
aroma
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
strong
coffee
flavors
and
hops
predominate
with
a
nice
bitter
and
dry
finish
it
is
not
really
that
drinkable
overall
it
reminds
me
of
a
much
smoother
and
lighter
version
of
their
imperial
stout
another
winner
from
sam
smith
i
used
to
think
this
was
the
nut
brown
ale
the
past
two
bottles
havent
wowed
me
though
i
mean
it
is
very
good
but
i
still
think
theres
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
good
representation
of
its
style
though
550
ml
clear
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
simply
satisifying
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
healthy
head
it
tastes
as
billed
the
caramel
malts
are
balanced
with
a
subtle
nut
flavor
this
one
is
the
hoppiest
of
the
sammy
smiths
which
isnt
saying
much
the
balance
is
simply
elegant
the
hop
finish
is
slight
enough
to
add
a
refreshing
crispness
without
detracting
from
the
more
prominent
malt
flavor
as
solid
as
they
come
cheers
verdict
another
excellent
brew
from
samuel
smith
samuel

beers
are
widely
available

i
can
always
count
on
this
brewery
whenever
i
need
an
interesting
goto
brew
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
a
kind
of
regular
no
huge
tastes
that
are
good
bland

dont
know
but
i
dont
really
enjoy

brown
ale
a
clean
brown
colored
beer
with

highlights
has
a

with

the
aroma

sweetness
and
some
carmel
in
the
background
a
good
roasted
malt
flavor
at
the
start
with
some
bitterness
along
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
a
smooth
bitter
and
toffee
sweet
finish
this
is
a
deep
chestnut
brown
ale
that
has
a
hint
of
caramel
and
chocolate
in
its
complexity
its
not
as
great
as
some
small
batch
brown
ales
but
is
really
top
notch
for
a
more
largely
produced
one
the
flavor
is
deep
the

is

and
it
is
significantly
better
than

12oz
bottle
from
northend
superette
manchester
nh
mmmm
this
for
me
is
the
signature
brown
ale
very
quaffable
this
beer
looks
smells
and
tastes
great
has
the
best
head
out
of
all
the
sam
smith
beers
and
has
some
of
the
best
aromas
on
a
side
note
theres
a
flavor
here
i
just
couldnt
figure
out
and
now
after
writing
my
review
and
reading
a
few
others
another
reviewer
made
me
realize
what
it
was
root
beer
not
the
major
component
of
the
flavor
but
its
in
there
all
in
all
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
samuel
smith
makes
consistently
good
beers
this
beer
has
a
nice
brown
color
with
reddish
hues
only
a
small
head
that
goes
away
very
quickly
on
the
nose
i
get
some
faint
maltiness
maybe
some
nutty
characteristics
pretty
much
what
i
would
expect
to
find
in
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
pretty
good
i
get
the
nuttiness
with
some
malt
and
a
nice
hoppy
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
oily
and
bubbly
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
smell
is
leafy
and
minty
kind
of
grassy
too
the
taste
is
nutty
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
i
will
try
another
when
they
cool
more
and
possibly
update
this
review
not
as
good
as
other
i
have
sampled
from
smith
smooth
drinking
not
too
fizzy
would
make
a
good
session
beer
but
a
bit
pricey
to
buy
in
quantity
comes
in
a
550ml
bottle
tasty
and
smooth
drinking
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
thick
tan
head
that
never
completely
goes
away
and
laces
very
well
aroma
of
malt
and
some
hops
nothing
much
else
but
thats
good
taste
was
a
great
toffee
malt
with
a
buttery
feel
and
nice
hoppy
finish
hints
of
chocolate
and
nuttiness
as
well
this
would
be
great
session
beer
if
it
were
more
readily
available
around
here
this
brew
pours
to
a
dark
but
clear
brown
color
with
a
huge
frothy
tan
colored
head
that
breaks
down
very
slowly
and
leaved
incredible
thick
clump
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
is
a
fine
looking
brew
the
aromas
are
intoxicating
scents
of
malt
sweet
toffee
caramel
with
a
nutty
scent
that
goes
perfectly
together
this
is
a
very
nice
pure
smelling
brew
the
taste
is
very
nice
a
heavy
malty
taste
that
leads
to
a
sweeter
sensation
in
the
mouth
not
overly
a
very
nice
balance
along
with
a
nutty
taste
and
a
modest
hoppyness
together
with
the
flavors
that
this
brew
has
it
is
a
simply
incredible
tasting
brew
and
one
that
is
extremely
well
balanced
if
you
have
not
tried
this
brew
give
it
a
whirl
i
am
sure
you
will
not
be
disappointed
this
is
a
fine
english
brown
ale
it
pours
from
the
bottle
as
a
rather
dark
brown
color
the
head
was
some
what
disappointing
in
being
both
small
and
short
lasting
the
smell
was
certainly
pleasing
as
was
the
taste
a
pleasant
malty
sweetness
with
a
nice
nutty
undertone
definitely
a
beer
to
search
out
and
enjoy
it
poured
a
beautiful
translucent
blackbrown
and
had
a
decent
head
that
over
topped
my
ss
glass
the
nose
contained
hints
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
puncuated
with
nobel
english
hops
the
taste
was
everything
that
the
smell
promised
and
more
the
only
thing
that
detracted
from
this
beer
was
a
metallic
taste
the
came
through
in
the
after
taste
i
guess
the
english
water
around
yorkshire
has
more
than
i
am
used
to
very
delightful
to
drink
and
not
heavy
on
the
alcohol
these
beers
would
make
for
a
good
night
of
drinking
deep
red
moderately
aromatic
fruity
and
fresh
with
a
strong
fragrance
of
hazelnut
along
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
fruit
taste
begins
with
a
note
of
browned
red
apple
immediate
midpalate
flavors
of
caramel
take
place
followed
by
a
long
and
satisfying
finish
with
notes
of
hazelnut
and
vanilla
a
wonderful
tasting
brew
and
a
pinnacle
for
its
style

samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
is
an
excellent
beer
and
its
a
shame
i
hadnt
tried
this
beer
before
truly
an
excellent
brown
ale
and
one
i
wish
wasnt
sold
only
as
a
single
a
wonderful
session
beer
pours
a
burnt
amber
ruby
color
with
a
nice
sized
almond
head
that
literally
coats
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
deep
caramel
and
bready
malts
and
floral
english
hops
the
taste
is
a
remarkable
blend
of
toffeeish
malts
and
floral
herbal
hops
quite
hoppy
especially
in
the
finish
theres
a
great
crisp
a
fruity
yeastyness
as
well
as
a
pleasan
subtle
diacytel
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
a
lingering
caramel
hop
bitterness
and
fruity
yeast
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
this
is
one
hell
of
a
good
brown
ale
its
definitely
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
anyone
who
likes
english
ales
should
like
this
smells
like
roasted
malt
and
caramel
tastes
the
same
nuts
and
malt
up
front
a
more
dry
caramel
malt
in
the
back
just
sweet
enough
but
not
very
complicated

smooth

very
light

a
the
local
grocery
store
pours
with
a
ncie
head
and
medium
carbonation
a
little
too
amber
colored
to
remind
me
of
a
nut
brown
smells
of
strong
hops
and
no
nuttiness
to
speak
of
a
bit
too
bitter
almost
tastes
like
an
esb
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
each
time
ive
tried
to
be
impressed
but
its
just
not
making
the
grade
in
comparison
to
other
local

browns

with
a
small

that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
smells
of
toasted
malts
and
sweet

taste
is
toasted
malt
nutty
with
a
little
carmel
sweetness
also
some
mildly
fruity
esters
make
a
welcome
appearance
and
just
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
tasty
good
session
beer
i
liked
it
a
lot
although
this
beer
calls
itself
a
nut
brown
i
would
call
is
more
of
a
dark
amber
has
an
off
white
head
sitting
on
top
smell
is
of
malt
and
esters
but
there
is
a
sulfury
note
reminincent
of
wine
and
an
unpleasant
one
at
that
taste
is
of
roasty
malt
throughout
hops
are
there
for
bitterness
only
there
is
a
slight
fruity
ester
with
a
winey
acidic
twang
but
very
mild
moderately
carbonated
and
thick
syrupy
body
as
it
is
very
mild
on
the
palate
it
could
make
a
great
session
beer
overall
a
good
brown
ale
and
definitely
one
worth
trying
but
the
clear
bottles
have
a
tendency
to
leave
some
euroskunk
from
time
to
time
and
until
the
brewery
changes
their
ways
i
cant
give
this
any
higher
marks
drinkability
the
carbonation
limits
my
appetite
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
but
overall
it
is
a
very
nice
brew
very
complex
but
not
very
exciting
pours
a
nice
brown
with
tan
head
lacing
will
mark
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
hazelnuts
and
cream
a
hint
of
cinnamon
lurks
caramel
and
chewy
thickness
reside
in
the
glass
the
taste
is
a
dark
chewy
sweet
with
nut
thickness
a
hint
of
lightly
toasted
grain
not
bad
had
better
poures
a
rich
reddish
brown
color
with
a
a
thin
offwhite
head
i
think
that
i
got
a
skunked
one
as
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
heineken
with
a
skunky
musky
aroma
the
taste
was
nothing
like
the
aroma
as
it
was
full
of
light
sweet
malt
in
the
front
which
segues
to
a
dry
nutty
lingering
malt
flavor
the
dry
finish
of
the
malt
flavors
is
accentuated
by
a
low
carbonation
level
and
i
believ
that
they
use
a
bit
of
kettle
sugars
in
the
recipe
the
hops
are
present
but
only
as
a
balance
to
the
initial
malt
sweetness
dry
in
the
finish
yet
sweet
in
the
begining
allows
this
beer
to
be
very
flavorful
and
very
refreshing
malt
is
the
flavor
that
gets
showcased
in
this
brew
yet
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
that
gives
it
a
complexity
not
normally
found
in
malt
oriented
beers
an
excellent
session
beer
as
well
as
a
very
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
as
long
as
you
can
avoid
a
skunked
one
clear
bottles
are
cheap

only
be
used

taste

with
a
ripe

i
was
truly
sad
when
i
took
my
last
sip
must
buy
more
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
a
nut
brown
by
samuel

pleasant

color
with
a
nice

as
for
the
smell
it
was
hard
to
tell
since
i
had
been
using
spray
paint
part
of
the
day
it
was
not
as
rich
or
smooth
as
i
am
used
to
with
other
brown
ales
it
did
go
down
quite
well
though
i
think
that
i
will
revisit
this
beer
again
soon

give
this
an
almost
creamy
feel
overall
this
is
one
great
nut
brown
a
true
classic
and
standard
notes
right
now
this
isnt
something
i
want
to
drink
all
the
time
but
i
definitely
want
to
try
it
again
when
im
a
more
experienced
ba
very
tasty
brown
ale
with
some
malty
sweetness
and
a
dry
completion
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
minimal
in
the
overall
profile
of
the
beer
poured
into
previously
acquired
samuel
smiths
imperial
pint
glass
my
new
favorite
beer
word
is
garnet
because
its
kind
of
that
clearish
deep
ruby
red
with
tendencies
towards
brown
or
at
least
the
way
ive
been
describing
it
this
is
how
this
one
pours
with
the
ever
so
slight
head
so
much
for
that
but
its
proper
and
has
a
really
really
nice
colour
the
nose
is
this
coffee
caramel
kind
of
like
the
way
candy
caramel
smells
but
much
more
subtle
moving
onto
taste
i
kind
of
have
to
take
issue
because
it
tastes
like
watered
down
coffee
in
a
good
and
bad
way
its
kind
of
like
a
gasp
light
porter
the
roasty
caramel
flavour
wraps
itself
around
ones
tongue
and
the
bitterness
finishes
off
by
sticking
itself
to
the
tongue
it
has
sort
of
portsherry
overtones
i
know
ive
been
saying
this
a
bit
lately
but
its
kind
of
like
yeah
like

as
with
all
smith
beers

beer
poured
with
a
very
thick
head
it
had
a
slightly
roasty
aroma
and
flavor
not
overly
syrupy
like
other
nut
browns
i
think
i
may
have
got
an
older
bottle
and
enjoyable
not
but
i
had
forgotten
just
how
good
it
is
a

has
a
bitter

a
bit
much
for
my
liking
average
to
lower

overall
wasnt
real
pleased
with
this
one
overall
this
is
a
good
flavored
beer
not
as
hoppy
or
hearty
as
some
but
good
toasted
malts
this
beer
by
itself
is
just
okay
it
would
be
much
more
enjoyable
if
paired
with
some
food
o
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
nut
brown
ales
this
is
what
i
would
consider
a
malt
forward
comfort
food
smooth
and
light
very
different
from
the
color
you
wouldnt
expect
cleansing
ale
properties
from
this
brew
but
thats
exactly
what
you
get
the
undertones
are
nutty
so
its
not
too
overbearing
its
enjoyable
and
sessionable
you
can
have
more
than
a
few
there
isnt
too
much
of
any
one
characterstic
in
this
brew
overall
i
love
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of

brown

a
brownish
color
with
a
very
small

there
is
a
light
nutty

lots

the
taste
has
strong
yeast
flavors
with
light
hints
of
nuts
there
is
a
rather
stale
taste
watery
stale

overall
a
disappointment
overall
this

an
excellent
brown
ale
nice
and
malty

full

damn
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
like
this
brew
because
it
is
light
enough
to
have
a
few
and
neutral
interesting
enough
to
have
with
wings
burgers
and
other
pub
type
fare
it
paired
well
with

made

for
it

a

offering
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
o
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
easily
drinkable
brown
ale
i
love
the
nuttyness
this
is
my
goto
for
easy
drinking
time
when
i
dont
want
anything
heavy
pours
brown
with
a
ruby
hue
on
the
edges
there
is
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
mildly
nutty
the
upfront
flavor
profile
is
dark
bread
with
a
very
light
touch
of
malty
sweetness
there
is
a
tingly
yet
soft
dry
bitterness
on
the
finish
o
clearly
above
average
for
style
notes
goose
island
shows
once
again
that
they
can
give
quality
english
beers
a
run
for
the
money
this
is
a
world
class
beer
in
my
opinion
and
is
stellar
in
every
way
will
become
a
winter
staple
for
sure
a
decent
brown
ale
but
lacking
in
the
complexity
and
body
to
make
it
a
more
american
brown
seems
to
be
much
more
in
line
with
a
classic
english
brown
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
not
gonna
get
it
again
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
si
a
decent
brown
ale
to
drink
for
a
while
o
balance
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
remarkably
so
a
good
beer
from
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
nice
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
smell
held
roasted
notes
and
carmel
hints
with
brown
sugar
depth
the
taste
followed
suit
with
a
solid
rich
roasted
malty
flavor
sweetness
a
contrasting
bitter
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
right
on
target
as
its
thick
enough
to
be
hearty
but
is
so
easy
to
drink
it
could
be
a
everyday
beer
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
again
soon
pretty
good
it
goes
down
easily
enough
plenty
of
dark
malt
notes
along
with
some
chocolate
and
a
residual
sweetness
the
aroma
is
satisfyingly
complex
while
the
flavour
seems
a
little
muted
by
comparison
the
body
is
slightly
thin
and
where
has
the
carbonation
disappeared
to
overall
a
decent
malty
brew
that
suits
the
colder
months
of
the
year
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
overall
a
really
delightful
nutty
brown
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
pint
after
pint
of
this
with
a
good
book
in
front
of
a
roaring
fireplace
the
mouth
feel
is
really
good
and
overall
a
really
good
brown
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
id
be
down
for
another
basically
any
time
had
a
bottle
of
this
and
poored
into
a
pint
glass
smell
is
very
nutty
and
chocolate
like
taste
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
smell
this
is
by
far
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
the
first
time
i
tryed
this
was
at
a
bar
and
my
friend
bought
me
one
of
these
bad
boys
and
wow
i
was
amazed
how
great
of
a
beer
it
was
big
props
to
goose
island
on
this
one
very
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
quite
tasty
brew
it
is
sweet
roasty
and
nutty
quite
an
easy
drinker
well
what
i
say
very
surprise
by
the
beer
what
a
great
color
in
my
glass
and
the
best
tasteing
brown
i
ever
taste
woth
chocolate
and
honey
how
can
you
go
wrong
well
you
this
beer
will
put
a
smile
on
your
face
doesnt
leave
an
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
and
it
has
a
great
pour
your
mouth
will
start
watering
when
you
see
it
so
sit
back
drink
a
few
oh
so
good
this
is
how
i
want
my
browns
to
taste
sweet
and
flavorful
while
still
remaining
very
easy
drinking
o
why
dont
i
see
this
as
much
in
ny
maybe
the
inbev
deal
will
change
that
because
this
matches
up
well
with
any
fall
seasonal
out
there
ill
have
another
paired
with
the
monster
burger
and
sweet
potato
fries
o
another
winner
from
goose
island
this
brew
really
treads
the
line
of
sweetness
chocolate
and
maltiness
very
well
while
providing
some
interesting
hop
character
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
brown
ales
considering
how
low
the
abv
is
most
sessionable
brown
ales
are
super
watery
and
flavorless
but
this
is
quite
enjoyable
and
something
i
would
definitely
revisit
down
the
road
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
color
a
light
tan
colored
head
on
top
with
a
good
retention
and
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
beer
had
a
big
malt
nose
with
a
healthy
amount
of
roasted
nuts
also
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
yeast
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
nicely
roasted
its
sweet
too
up
front
and
finishes
with
a
good
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
creamy
and
smooth
subtle
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
quite
good
in
my
opinion
i
would
enjoy
this
one
over
and
over
again
i
think
overall
my
favorite
brown
ale
easily
o
a
decent
and
easily
drunk
brown
not
a
robust
brown
but
still
interesting
enough
i
really
bought
this
for
cooking
but
i
drank
what
wasnt
used
in
the
recipe
so
dark
mahogany
color
nearly
opaque
in
the
dim
light
but
still
clear
with
a
lasting
fizzy
tannish
head
toasted
grains
on
the
nose
and
not
much
else
taste
of
toasted
grains
light
caramel
cocoa
powder
earth
leading
to
an
uncomfortable
metallic
twinge
that
turned
to
chalk
in
my
mouth
not
bad
at
first
but
just
really
turned
bland
and
almost
sour
quickly
its
no
secret
that
im
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
and
this
one
wasnt
among
the
better
ive
had
decent
and
drinkable
for
the
style
in
general
at
least
it
went
to
good
use
in
my
marinade
o
a
nice
mild
brown
ale
cocoa
is
a
nice
touch
its
pretty
mild
but
nicely
balanced
with
a
great
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
not
a
bad
offering
from
gi
try
it
as
i
said
and
as
many
others
have
said
the
goose
island
nut
brown
ale
is
a
very
good
representative
of
the
english
brown
ale
style
which
granted
may
be
in
rather
low
demand
as
americans
tend
to
favor
the
hoppier
styles
the
nuttiness
is
there
but
its
not
the
mark
of
the
beer
more
of
a
stylish
accessory
if
you
will
o
im
a
big
fan
of
goose
island
and
always
have
been
this
is
a
classic
for
me
as
ive
had
many
of
these
in
the
past
glad
to
get
around
to
a
well
deserved
review
the
beer
is
a
very
good
but
brown
but
what
keeps
it
from
being
great
is
its
thickness
it
is
smooth
enough
but
when
i
think
nut
brown
ale
i
want
that
stick
to
your
mouth
thickness
and
this
is
a
little
thin
in
that
regard
however
the
flavor
aromas
and
color
of
this
ale
are
dead
on
and
its
a
very
very
good
brew
without
question
a
brew
every
brown
ale
fanatic
should
have
goose
island
have
a
little
underrated
gem
here
its
worth
the
buy
finger
plus
head
of
airy
evenly
surfaced
foam
which
dissipates
very
quickly
like
nothing
left
at
all
the
lacing
is
wispy
at
best
and
likewise
there
and
gone
clear
brown
colored
liquid
soft
orange
tint
and
then
yellow
further
towards
the
rims
good
amount
of
active
tiny
bubbles
which
are
widely
dispersed
extremely
sweet
nose
of
caramel
chocolate
toffee
and
creamed
coffee
notes
of
candied
nuts
there
are
some
cereal
grains
and
scone
in
there
but
nothing
offered
which
could
stiffen
the
feel
and
counterbalance
the
sugary
aspects
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
finely
grained
so
to
speak
but
does
stir
things
about
the
mouth
here
you
get
more
bread
yeast
nuts
and
anise
to
temper
the
excesses
of
the
chocolate
caramel
coffee
hint
of
orange
peel
does
not
produce
any
metallic
nor
roasted
notes
nor
anything
remotely
herbaceous
while
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
there
is
a
general
cleanliness
to
it
minimal
residue
at
the
end
in
many
regards
simple
but
better
put
as
pure
of
purpose
nothing
more
needs
be
said
o
good
beer
nice
example
of
the
style
worth
a
try
o
goose
island
nut
brown
ale
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
it
is
highly
drinkable
i
bought
a
case
immediately
after
my
first
draft
experience
shortly
after
gi
came
to
pa
as
a
plus
those
who
are
quick
to
dismiss
dark
beers
will
even
find
this
one
to
be
very
approachable
o
nice
beer
subtle
yet
complex
and
most
improtantly
flavorful
good
showing
o
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
not
getting
as
much
nuttiness
as
other
nut
browns
but
a
good
brown
ale
nonetheless
another
fine
beer
by
goose
island
thanks
to
thebishopco
for
this
one
o
a
really
nice
brown
ale
which
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
is
my
goto
brown
here
in
chicago
and
im
so
happy
its
around
to
grab
whenever
im
in
the
mood
pours
dark
brown
with
offwhite
head
thats
fades
faint
scent
of
nuttiness
caramel
and
honey
tastes
of
caramel
hazlenut
honey
and
slight
cinnamon
with
a
clean
bitterness
some
malt
sweet
ess
stays
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
good
brown
ale
i
was
hoping
to
say
more
but
there
really
isnt
much
else
to
say
passable
but
nothing
memorable
or
desirable
for
this
style
too
bad
things
seemed
to
start
off
quite
well
this
nut
brown
ale
from
goose
sports
a
nutty
brownish
color
that
has
light
shades
of
black
from
afar
a
nice
inch
of
loosely
coiled
tan
foam
goes
up
and
than
down
leaving
small
spots
smell
has
a
weird
hay
scent
to
it
on
first
sniffs
but
more
investigation
i
pick
out
light
melted
chocolate
nutty
appeal
some
caramel
scent
with
some
earthy
hops
light
yet
to
the
point
taste
is
well
balanced
with
the
malt
mixing
in
with
light
nuts
minus
the
salt
some
cocco
powder
taste
along
with
light
tootsie
roll
and
faint
roast
nicely
rounded
again
feel
is
very
smooth
with
low
carb
and
no
bitterness
body
is
less
than
medium
and
easy
sipper
all
in
all
its
a
simple
style
without
nuts
and
bolts
and
this
is
a
good
representation
of
it
good
spring
time
weather
beer
i
find
the
goose
islands
nut
brown
to
be
a
wellrounded
brown
ale
its
a
fine
example
of
a
brown
ale
in
all
facets
it
looks
robust
in
a
glass
and
boasts
the
bready
scent
of
a
good
english
beer
imagine
the
taste
of
a
light
molasses
mixed
with
a
bit
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
and
youve
got
a
good
idea
of
what
this
nut
brown
ale
is
all
about
i
wouldnt
describe
the
mouthfeel
as
being
particularly
watery
but
its
far
from
being
creamy
either
there
exists
a
good
balance
here
its
a
good
beer
its
a
brown
ale
that
will
not
disappoint
now
i
just
have
to
find
myself
a
plate
of
bangers
and
mash
o
a
decent
drinkable
englishamerican
brown
ale
hybrid
oexcept
for
the
mouthfeel
a
decent
brown
ale
however
the
beer
is
too
on
the
watery
side
o
a
solid
brown
recommended
first
try
from
this
brewery
hope
they
make
it
down
to
nc
someday
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
had
served
on
tap
and
for
2
50
worth
the
price
of
the
pour
will
seek
out
other
goose
island
offerings
opretty
good
brown
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
anytime
o
this
is
only
ok
imho
at
least
it
is
fairly
light
and
goes
down
easy
final
note
i
recall
the
draft
version
being
significantly
better
than
its
bottled
counterpart
so
please
dont
pass
judgment
on
this
beer
until
youve
had
it
on
tap
very
good
way
to
make
an
impression
we
just
barely
got
goose
island
in
vt
o
this
beer
is
average
but
it
is
redeemable
in
the
fact
that
it
would
make
a
perfect
session
ale
due
to
the
mouthfeel
and
alcohole
percentage
o
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
really
shines
in
gooses
style
great
english
inspired
bitters
and
brown
ales
this
is
a
beer
that
is
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
and
fresh
but
what
disappoints
is
the
lack
of
a
rich
mouthfeel
more
leinenkugal
thanthree
floyds
for
sure
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
color
that
has
some
ruby
hues
when
held
to
the
light
a
pretty
vigorous
pours
yields
just
over
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
fairly
short
retention
and
leaves
some
scattered
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
nice
bit
of
toasted
malt
sweetness
and
some
nuttiness
most
notably
hazelnut
there
are
also
some
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
and
there
is
just
a
little
bit
of
hop
presence
poking
through
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
and
hazelnut
flavor
there
are
some
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
present
as
well
also
there
is
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
coming
through
not
much
but
its
there
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
nutty
flavors
on
the
palate
this
has
medium
body
that
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
and
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
really
creamy
feel
to
it
there
is
some
sweetness
here
not
much
else
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
low
abv
and
creamy
feel
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
personally
i
like
a
little
more
hop
presence
in
my
brown
ales
i
think
this
beer
is
worth
checking
out
if
you
come
across
it
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
im
bummed
that
it
is
no
longer
bottled
this
along
with
the
oatmeal
stout
is
incentive
enough
for
me
to
get
to
the
brewery
really
one
of
the
better
nut
brown
ales
buy
it
up
if
you
see
it
despite
its
age
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
outstanding
and
one
of
the
best
session
ales
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
i
would
love
to
see
brewers
turn
more
to
doing
things
like
this
as
it
really
shows
off
what
can
be
done
without
going
to
the
extreme
this
is
for
the
price
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
that
i
know
of
it
has
a
satisfying
taste
and
heaviness
and
is
highly
sessionable
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
is
desirable
once
the
carbonation
fades
and
that
doesnt
take
so
long
its
a
shame
that
its
no
longer
being
brewed
drinkability
its
relatively
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
but
the
flavor
just
does
not
pop
its
a
smooth
session
beer
but
there
are
better
browns
out
there
flavor
brings
some
nutty
characteristics
along
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
a
light
earthiness
is
present
as
well
good
body
with
nice
carbonation
this
is
quite
nice
and
its
too
bad
that
gi
wont
be
bottling
this
any
longer
drink
i
could
have
a
few
2
or
3
but
wouldnt
want
much
more
than
that
at
a
sitting
md
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
low
abv
balanced
full
flavored
yet
excellent
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
styles
well
crafted
by
goose
island
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
get
it
while
it
lasts
in
bottles
d
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
but
i
think
the
flavor
is
a
bit
to
odd
to
drink
all
time
i
will
be
cutting
myself
off
after
one
or
two
3
5
d
even
though
the
mouthfeel
sucks
this
isnt
that
bad
of
a
drinker
decent
taste
if
they
mashed
higher
this
would
have
some
good
potential
dgood
drinkability
with
this
beer
pours
with
a
three
finger
dark
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer

a
good

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
i
prefer
smuttynoses
old
brown
dog
as
a
english
brown
ale
over
this
one
but
i
hadnt
had
this
before
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
id
certainly
suggest
trying
it
nut
brown
ale
has
held
up
well
after
several
months
quite
enjoyable
its
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
a
descent
brown
ale
nothing
too
special
but
a
nice
brew
to
start
the
night
off
with
this
beer
is
brown
it
smells
dry
and
nutty
with
some
acidityalcohol
there
is
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
this
beer
tastes
good
it
tastes
like
nuts
dark
malt
and
some
dry
alcohol
think
sam
smiths
nut
brown
but
less
expensive
to
buy
or
think
newcastle
with
added
nut
flavor
and
an
actual
taste
this
beer
is
full
for
a
brown
ie
no
wateriness
that
is
usually
an
unfortunate
staple
of
the
style
yet
still
simple
and
drinkable
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
easily
drinkable
now
if
only
gi
would
bring
back
the
bottled
oatmeal
stout
the
taste
is
not
far
off
the
indicators
in
the
aroma
there
are
plenty
of
dark
malts
roasted
notes
some
nutty
flavors
but
nothing
too
assertive
in
that
department
very
sweet
chocolate
and
a
honeyed
sweetness
probably
from
dextrin
added
things
tighten
up
a
bit
in
the
finish
but
overall
this
is
a
too
sweet
nut
brown
ale
with
some
nice
caramel
and
toffee
notes
but
not
enough
nutty
flavors
and
too
much
of
the
cloying
sweetness
its
a
decent
beer
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
this
is
not
a
sam
smiths
by
a
long
mile
d
very
drinkable
would
be
great
with
thanksgiving
dinner
too
bad
its
not
going
to
be
bottled
anymore
dthis
is
a
pleasant
brown
ale
its
a
shame
that
gi
has
decided
to
discontinue
this
brew
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
sessionable
it
would
definitely
pair
well
with
food
as
the
flavors
in
the
taste
are
not
very
overpowering
d
its
pretty
easy
going
down
although
after
a
while
it
tastes
like
whole
wheat
crackers
more
than
anything
else
i
bet
it
would
be
good
with
hummus
and
carrots
or
maybe
something
creamy
d
very
drinkable
good
sessionability
a
nice
and
easily
accessible
brew
will
miss
having
this
widely
distributed
not
as
much
as
the
oatmeal
stout
though
d
yes
malty
goodness
at
a
relatively
low
abv
interesting
enough
to
have
more
than
one
pours
a
copper
colour
with
foaming
white
head
malty
aroma
average
mouthfeel
maltyincluding
chocolate
maltscaramel
making
it
easily
drinkable
and
not
too
sweet
some
nut
flavour
offsets
as
well
as
some
decent
hops
suitable
carbonation
refreshing
drinkability
i
heard
this
beer
was
now
going
to
be
no
longer
bottled
so
i
hunted
for
it
and
got
a
bottle
but
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
the
appearance
is
great
but
it
smellstastes
like
someone
was
smoking
when
it
was
brewed
maybe
it
is
meant
to
simulate
a
smoky
english
pub
im
not
getting
it
though
the
description
sounds
so
good
on
the
bottle
but
this
is
sadly
a
disappointment
not
awe
inspiring
but
not
bad
at
all
for
my
taste
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
chocolate
and
fruit
character
to
compliment
and
counter
the
huge
body
respectively
drinkability
one
of
the
better
traditional
english
brown
ales
around
or
it
was
one
of
the
better
until
they
foolishly
decided
to
axe
it
just
a
shame
i
had
read
today
that
this
beer
is
no
longer
going
to
be
bottled
while
at
the
liquor
store
tonight
i
saw
a
six
pack
and
thought
i
should
pick
one
up
before
its
too
late
poured
into
standard
pint
glasses
dark
brown
color
with
just
a
hint
of
ruby
red
towards
the
center
very
nice
sized
white
head
not
a
lot
of
lacing
smell
reminded
me
of
slightly
burnt
coffee
beans
taste
was
very
pleasing
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
honey
in
the
background
slight
chocolate
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
what
i
have
been
craving
from
other
brown
ales
some
heartiness
is
exactly
what
i
like
to
have
in
this
type
of
beer
and
gi
delivers
borderline
almost
as
thick
as
a
porter
low
abv
great
taste
and
even
better
mouthfeel
all
add
up
to
one
great
brown
ale
too
bad
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
one
but
better
late
than
never
drinkability
this
was
a
beer
i
drank
in
college
back
when
it
was
called
hex
nut
might
go
out
and
buy
some
more
since
it
will
not
be
made
again
nothing
too
special
pretty
straightforward
the
name
change
minus
the
hexdoesnt
mean
the
flavor
did
still
maltynutty
and
a
slight
hop
finish
pours
great
and
the
flavor
changes
for
the
best
as
it
warms
just
like
a
good
american
brown
ale
should
not
as
rich
and
thick
as
some
american
browns
dogfish
head
indian
bells
best
brown
avery
ellies
best
brown
etc
but
this
is
on
my
list
to
buy
when
i
come
across
it
i
think
i
taste
black
patent
malt
it
is
darker
tasting
brown
ale
closer
to
a
stout
in
some
ways
the
aftertaste
is
long
lasting
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
the
body
is
as
expected
i
admit
that
nut
brown
ales
are
seldom
on
my
radar
but
this
is
worth
sampling
again
nice
job
taste
sturdy
for
a
brown
ale
not
a
thin
brown
ale
minimal
hop
presence
but
smooth
mouthfeel
for
the
ample
malt
background
very
easy
drinking
not
my
style
of
beer
but
easy
to
acknowledge
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
price
is
average
for
what
you
get
drinkabilty
even
though
it
is
a
darker
beer
dont
let
that
fool
you
it
goes
down
nicely
but
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
after
you
have
had
two
or
three
you
are
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
it
is
an
ok
brew
and
like
the
rest
of
this
pack
it
seems
like
a
generic
representation
of
the
style
is
it
good
sure
could
it
be
better
of
course
i
would
say
that
of
the
four
beers
out
of
this
sampler
this
would
be
one
that
i
would
probably
avoid
in
the
future
overall
robust
and
flavorful
a
nice
brown
goin
down
maybe
im
crazy
for
picking
up
dark
fruit
flavors
here
i
did
have
a
few
beers
before
this
but
the
unique
nature
of
this
brown
is
enjoyable
as
i
havent
discovered
too
much
variation
in
this
style
before
this
md
great
tasting
english
brown
from
goose
island
nice
dark
chocolate
coffee
flavor
sweet
tasting
but
not
overpowering
very
easy
to
drink
and
to
share
i
will
keep
this
on
my
radar
for
purchasing
again
has
a
coffeelike
appearance
dark
brown
as
a
whole
but
with
hints
of
red
in
smaller
quantities
head
was
darker
tan
smell
was
a
mix
of
sweet
nuts
and
malts
tasted
initially
like
a
somewhat
sweet
stout
but
as
i
went
on
the
nuts
and
caramel
started
to
become
more
apparent
not
too
carbonated
goes
down
smooth
pretty
good
beer
to
go
with
a
dessert
d
a
solid
but
not
very
exciting
brown
ale
pretty
par
for
the
course
gi
always
does
a
good
job
making
solid
brews
that
will
be
widely
accepted
and
widely
distributed
in
the
chicago
area
and
this
fits
that
bill
a
brew
you
can
rely
on
if
you
find
it
but
not
one
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
with
a
good
pour
it
produced
little
head
but
the
head
was
nice
and
caramel
left
great
lacing
down
the
glass
and
was
carbonated
until
the
end
it
was
a
dark
amber
brown
color
that
looked
great
in
the
pint
glass
the
smell
wasnt
strong
but
what
there
was
there
was
a
nice
roasted
malt
smell
and
strong
nut
flavor
i
picked
up
a
little
spice
too
with
what
seemed
like
was
almost
a
hint
of
orange
the
taste
was
a
fresh
nutty
flavor
with
a
nice
finish
of
toasted
malts
it
went
down
smooth
with
plenty
of
carbonation
but
seemed
a
bit
little
too
thin
it
was
a
great
beer
to
drink
overall
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
day
another
great
beer
by
goose
island
drink
very
drinkable
not
so
fullflavored
as
some
other
american
ales
labeled
nut
brown
closer
to
traditional
english
brown
ales
the
12
ounce
bottle
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
rose
a
2
finger
head
and
was
brown
it
smelled
a
bit
of
toasted
pecans
and
some
malt
the
tasted
was
mostly
malt
with
a
hint
of
nut
rounded
out
by
a
nice
bitterness
the
nuttiness
was
not
what
i
had
expected
i
wanted
more
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
but
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
it
would
go
nice
with
some
foods
and
is
a
solid
beer
d
easy
to
drink
one
or
two
but
not
interesting
enough
to
have
any
more
than
that
i
got
this
as
part
of
the
goose
island
mixed
12
pack
and
i
find
this
to
be
the
weakest
beer
in
it
d
very
nice
good
example
of
the
style
goose
island
has
been
slowly
sending
an
increased
variety
of
beers
to
our
area
and
theyre
turning
up
in
more
and
more
stores
theyre
welcome
here
the
pale
and
the
ipa
were
great
so
i
figured
the
brown
one
of
my
favorite
styles
would
be
a
winner
i
was
right
easily
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
hadat
least
in
a
bottle
gorgeous
deep
brown
in
the
glass
with
ruby
highlights
a
thick
tan
head
that
nearly
flowed
over
the
top
and
laced
nicely
all
the
way
down
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
and
the
same
in
the
initial
taste
coupled
with
a
touch
of
sweet
and
a
hint
of
coffee
dry
in
the
finish
though
not
bitter
as
i
expected
and
really
very
drinkable
i
may
look
for
a
case
of
this
stuff
a
tad
rich
for
a
session
beer
but
a
welcome
if
somewhat
less
complex
addition
to
my
fridge
malty
chocolate
note
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
thats
not
overbearing
nor
artificaltasting
tasty
and
enjoyable
stuff
pours
clear
and
light
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
with
a
light
tan
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
hints
of
toasted
malt
the
light
body
is
moderately
carbonated
and
is
packed
with
toastednutty
flavors
from
the
malt
no
hop
presence
is
noticeable
but
the
beer
is
well
balanced
the
finish
is
light
and
smooth
and
fades
away
slowly
with
the
flavor
of
sweet
toasted
nuts
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
could
do
two
or
three
no
problem
decent
drinking
beer
enjoyed
it
d
enjoyed
this
beer
might
be
a
little
better
if
fresh
would
gladly
take
another
on
if
i
had
it
in
the
fridge
good
nut
brown
which
i
find
hard
to
come
by
in
this
style
i
will
definitely
drink
this
one
again
pours
a
dark
rather
clear
brown
with
reddish
highlights
throughout
a
small
tan
head
rises
and
falls
quickly
and
leaves
dots
of
lace
in
its
wake
the
aroma
is
not
very
prominent
subtle
notes
of
caramel
nuts
and
toffee
the
burst
onto
the
palate
is
of
mild
earthy
hops
with
full
flavored
malts
quickly
in
tow
toffee
and
nuts
with
sticky
slightly
syrupy
caramel
medium
bodied
warm
and
inviting
highly
drinkable
any
time
of
the
year
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
d
high
one
of
the
better
nut
browns
i
have
had
a
treat
but
i
could
have
more
than
one
d
fair
it
has
decent
flavor
but
the
watery
feel
is
offputting
ill
probably
try
it
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
nice
caramel
lacing
and
moderate
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
smells
of
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
bean
taste
is
right
for
a
nut
brown
and
shows
a
hint
of
creaminess
which
i
think
is
this
beers
greatest
aspect
medium
in
body
good
carbonation
abv
nonexistent
for
the
most
part
very
drinkable
and
could
be
made
into
a
session
if
one
was
in
the
mood
a
stellar
beer
from
a
brewery
in
which
im
just
starting
to
enjoy
d
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
goose
island
very
easy
drinking
and
this
is
one
i
will
probably
come
back
to
fairly
often
good
stuff
pours
a
deep
brown
with
off
white
head
smells
of
coffee
roasted
malt
and
toffee
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
another
solid
offering
from
goose
island
also
very
drinkable
got
this
as
a
part
of
a
variety
pack
with
honkers
ale
oatmeal
stout
and
ipa
great
value
for
good
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
good
puffy
34
head
leaves
behind
some
lacing
nice
dark
brown
color
little
bit
of
red
very
roasted
smell
of
coffee
tastes
like
toasted
nut
toffee
and
coffee
has
a
nice
caramelly
aftertaste
not
too
sweet
though
carbonation
is
good
drinkability
is
quite
nice
i
think
some
one
who
doesnt
necessarily
like
beer
would
have
to
enjoy
this
i
would
say
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
look
forward
to
in
a
multipack
but
i
wouldnt
actually
go
out
and
by
a
sixpack
of
it
its
fine
but
goose
has
better
beers
honkers
oatmeal
stout
ipa
nice
easy
to
drink
brown
ale
here
personally
i
would
reach
for
a
newcastle
over
this
if
it
wasnt
as
burnt
tasting
it
would
be
great
still
a
solid
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
am
lucky
to
have
a
local
brand
that
has
the
ability
to
take
this
style
on
and
execute
it
properly
that
said
if
you
are
local
as
i
am
this
is
one
beer
that
can
cellar
for
a
short
time
to
improve
my
first
reaction
was
that
this
beer
was
a
little
underwelming
but
after
trying
a
second
bottle
a
week
later
it
grew
on
me
it
poured
out
brown
with
slightly
red
highlights
what
little
head
there
was
quickly
fizzled
away
it
smelled
mostly
of
nutty
malt
with
underlying
caramel
as
it
warmed
the
caramel
moved
forward
and
swirling
it
brought
out
a
hint
of
dates
and
other
dark
fruit
the
flavor
matched
with
nuts
caramel
and
malt
though
not
with
any
great
complexity
the
finish
was
ok
though
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
these
flavors
are
not
robust
and
diminish
if
served
cold
drinkablility
a
good
nut
brown
ale
that
i
will
drink
again
very
drinkable
indeed
a
nice
sessionable
brew
that
is
easy
on
the
palate
d
man
this
is
a
solid
darker
medium
bodied
ale
perfect
for
the
autumn
weather
tasty
and
satisfying
anyone
hot
for
new
castle
brown
ought
to
try
this
as
a
fresh
alternative
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
looking
body
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
toffee
caramel
and
toasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
flavors
of
toasted
bread
and
nuts
lead
to
a
sweet
finish
very
nice
beer
for
a
brisk
fall
day
pretty
nice
atmosphere
decent
appearance
and
really
solid
nose
slight
complexity
in
flavor
and
good
balance
and
combination
of
components
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
pretty
drinkable
beer
d
lovely
brew
it
reminds
me
of
a
nut
brown
i
used
to
drink
back
in
college
in
the
uk
22
years
ago
i
love
it
when
a
low
abv
and
simple
beer
is
well
done
and
has
some
character
d
left
me
wishing
my
buddy
had
brought
more
than
one
would
be
a
great
session
brew
ill
get
it
again
if
i
get
the
chance
md
this
one
is
smooth
and
silky
very
sessionable
beer
d
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
not
very
dull
but
not
inyourface
with
flavors
i
havent
had
this
in
a
couple
of
years
and
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
it
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
lighter
brown
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
23
inch

of
a
pale
tan
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
yeast
hints
of
coffee
and
a
slight
citrus
aroma
raisin
fits
the
style
of
an
english
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
hops
sweet
malt
and
brown
sugar
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
good
appearance
and
aroma
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
personal
tastes
but
otherwise
a
solid
beer
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
set
lips
to
if
there
ever
was
a
perfect
beer
this
is
it
if
i
lived
in
illinois
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
and
i
am
not
sure
i
could
go
back
to
the
somewhat
good
beers
this
is
a
connoisseurs
beer
i
cant
give
enough
praise
for
it
bar
none
one
of
the
best
beers
and
breweries
in
this
country
usa
that
is
conclusion
decent
english
brown
but
nothing
really
makes
it
memorable
i
love
gi
but
this
is
not
one
of
their
better
brews
imo
they
just
put
the
cask
on
today
so
this
may
be
the
first
time
it
has
been
in
cask
form
perhaps
why
there
are
no
other
cask
reviews
chicagoans
should
definitely
check
this
one
out
i
posted
a
review
of
this
beer
from
notes
and
thought
i
did
it
an
injustice
so
i
decided
to
redo
a
review
with
a
fresh
beer
poured
into
my
samuel
smith
pint
glass
wow
i
love
this
beer
from
goose
island
taste
and
drinkability
are
definitely
the
highlights
of
this
brown
ale
on
a
recent
visit
to
the
chicago
area
i
drank
this
beer
and
three
floyds
gumballhead
and
i
couldnt
have
been
happier
give
this
gi
beer
a
chance
youll
be
glad
you
did
bad
mouth
ab
if
you
want
but
you
cant
diss
goose
island
for
making
one
hell
of
a
brown
a
dark
brown
color
with
three
finger
head
had
a
somewhat
strong
smell
including
a
bit
of
a
nut
smell
tasted
like
nuts
with
a
bit
of
a
hops
taste
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
especially
before
head
was
completely
gone
had
a
pretty
decent
drinkability
really
liked
it
i
wish
i
were
a
better
more
descriptive
reviewer
so
i
could
do
this
beer
justice
this
dark
brown
ale
pours
with
one
finger
tan
head
and
the
blossoming
aroma
of
roasted
hazelnuts
and
pecans
and
even
nutmeg
it
greets
the
pallet
with
mild
sweet
malts
and
finishes
with
more
nut
flavors
has
a
slight
oiliness
that
coats
the
tongue
and
helps
those
wonderful
nutbread
flavors
linger
with
limited
malt
sweetness
and
a
modest
abv
this
beer
can
be
a
great
session
ale

a
touch

and
a
slight
bitter

fairly
active
with
a
slightly
astringent

pretty
solid

drinkable
these
are
easy
to
go
through
quickly
and
beg
for
more
one
of
the
better
gi
offerings
that
ive
had
notes
a
good
beer
to
have
with
burger
and
fries
decent
in
every
aspect
and
worth
having
from
time
to
time
easy
drinker
a
very
solid
brown
thats
going
in
the
rotation
this
summer
i
can
drink
these
often
its
no
sam
smiths
but
its
more
affordable
this
one
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
very
light
lacing
the
smell
is
definitely
of
nuts
with
underlying
malt
sweetness
and
a
toasty
grain
background
the
taste
is
malty
with
typical
caramel
sweetness
that
isnt
overbearing
a
toasty
nut
taste
finishes
and
very
light
herbal
and
fruit
notes
lurk
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
malty
with
a
pretty
full
body
the
smell
and
taste
arent
especially
complex
but
theyre
wellbalanced
and
rich
its
nothing
particular
or
extravagant
but
its
a
wellcrafted
brew
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
very
good
rendition
by
the
guys
at
goose
island
taste
expected
a
little
bit
heavier
beer
but
i
would
say
it
is
still
a
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
carmel
sweetness
but
less
pronounced
then
the
smell
with
a
slight
toasted
taste
there
is
not
a
very
strong
aftertaste
and
for
the
most
part
is
fairly
sweet
without
being
too
sweet
when
i
drink
brown
ale
im
looking
for
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
this
had
more
of
a
coffee
flavor
goose
island
nut
brown
ale
poured
a
nice
brownruby
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
smell
was
of
sweet
nuts
and
hints
of
hops
could
have
smelled
a
bit
stronger
taste
was
nice
lots
of
chocolate
and
hints
of
nuts
mouthfeel
was
a
little
think
for
me
drinkability
was
good
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
d
could
have
ten
tonight
tasty
and
nice
without
too
much
to
think
about
taste
leans
heavily
toward
the
sweet
malty
side
of
things
but
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
toasty
malts
and
floral
hop
bitterness
i
like
the
fact
that
i
can
pick
out
the
nuttiness
kind
of
an
almond
and
pecan
flavor
its
all
a
tad
too
muted
i
would
like
it
a
bit
more
inyourface
but
that
is
being
picky
basically
it
is
a
great
session
beer
that
wont
get
boring
to
fast
d
get
me
10
of
these
i
can
keep
drinking
these
all
night
d
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
well
made
and
consistent
with
the
style
i
like
the
depth
of
flavor
and
the
way
the
different
flavor
elements
compliment
each
other
imo
this
is
one
of
the
stand
out
brews
from
goose
island
a
little
too
sweet
and
roasty
to
be
sessionable
still
an
enjoyable
beer
though
drinkability
is
awesome
on
this
beer
goose
island
created
an
english
brown
ale
that
has
great
taste
to
it
that
is
all
balanced
out
in
a
nice
way
i
would
be
happy
to
sit
back
with
one
of
these
beers
or
take
down
a
good
amount
in
a
drinking
session
this
is
a
fine
english
style
ale
that
has
strong
flavors
yet
is
very
easy
to
enjoy
d
a
good
flavor
along
with
a
good
alcohol
content
makes
for
a
sessionable
ale
nothing
really
exciting
or
new
with
this
beer
just
a
reliable
brown
ale
worth
drinking
notes
i
will
stick
with
samuel
smith
for
my
nut
brown
ale
but
this
is
adequate
it
looks
pretty
with
its
shiny
dark
brown
body
and
thin
tan
head
the
mild
carbonation
is
perfect
for
a
heavier
beer
but
the
taste
was
just
not
that
good
overall
a
really
solid
beer
from
gi
ive
only
had
a
few
of
them
and
that
was
mainly
about
45
years
but
they
have
always
impressed
me
gonna
have
to
get
some
more
of
them
to
try
recommend
if
you
can
easily
get
good
session
beer
smooth
and
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
a
delight
to
drink
it
feels
good
on
the
tongue
and
really
works
to
whet
your
appetite
for
another
beer
nikki
drinkability
not
a
great
session
beer
but
good
to
drink
after
a
meal
drinkability
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
far
superior
examples
of
nut
browns
out
there
to
choose
from
makes
for
an
okay
quaffer
pours
a
brown
with
some
light
peeking
through
at
the
edges
the
tall
creamy
brown
head
is
leaving
a
lot
of
lacethis
looks
better
than
i
anticipated
the
nose
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
toffee
some
nutty
flavorsbut
more
along
the
lines
of
caramelchocolate
sweetness
some
nice
hop
bitterness
and
subtle
watered
down
coffee
flavors
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
fuller
matching
the
flavor
profile
better
nicely
carbonated
and
a
sugary
sticky
coating
lingers
after
the
pallet
is
dry
a
nice
nbanot
one
of
my
favorite
stylesbut
this
one
delivers
drinkability
is
very
high
simple
tasty
nothing
crazy
complex
nice
brown
ale
thanks
wadsey
for
the
opportunity
overall
not
to
bad
of
a
job
one
of
the
better
nut
brown
ales
i
have
tried
mouthfeel
is
inconsistent
and
watery
the
only
real
drawback
to
this
beer
drinkability
is
goodthis
is
not
asammy
smiththisisthebestbrownaleever
kind
of
english
alenothing
really
spetacular
but
good
nonetheless
d
i
had
two
before
i
finished
this
review
and
thats
only
happened
a
couple
of
time
so
id
have
to
say
pretty
damn
drinkable
it
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
little
bit
of
redness
to
the
hue
it
is
opaque
looking
for
the
most
part
almost
stout
or
porter
looking
it
has
a
tan
head
and
lace
it
has
malty
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
nuts
honestly
it
is
bland
in
the
aroma
there
is
some
decent
lace
it
had
a
nice
head
but
it
disappeared
quickly
slight
flavor
is
slightly
nutty
but
i
would
go
with
more
of
a
toffee
flavor
almost
like
a
porter
at
the
end
it
has
a
sweet
chocolaty
bitter
flavor
smooth
body
ive
only
had
a
few
beers
identified
as
a
brown
ale
and
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
i
am
loving
goose
island
more
and
more
for
what
they
do
i
can
see
these
in
my
future
nothing
horrible
here
but
nothing
really
special
either
this
would
go
better
with
a
big
burger
to
hold
it
up
just
not
enough
character
or
body
to
stand
alone
lightly
carbonated
and
pretty
smooth
this
beer
is
going
down
fairly
nicely
a
little
more
on
the
bitter
side
than
most
of
what
i
have
tried
thus
far
but
it
doesnt
affect
the
drinkability
much
for
me
the
feel
is
medium
and
to
style
very
drinkable
and
would
works
well
with
the
changing
of
the
leaves
outside
pairs
great
with
stews
and
roasted
meat
good
brown
ale
one
of
my
favorates
i
really
like
brown
ales
and
this
one
is
pretty
good
representation
of
they
style
all
in
all
a
good
brown
ale
nicely
done
but
not
spectacular
deasy
to
drink
and
overall
a
good
brew
ill
reach
for
this
one
again
for
a
solid
brown
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
a
big
roasted
malt
character
that
hits
the
spot
perfectly
this
is
really
not
a
complex
beer
but
one
that
i
easily
enjoy
d
goes
down
very
easy
this
is
a
highly
quaffable
nut
brown
ale
and
one
i
will
enjoy
in
the
future
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
smooth
and
semimellow
drinking
brew
that
has
a
pleasant
warming
quality
perfect
for
an
autumn
evening
cheers
this
is
a
fine
english
style
ale
that
has
strong
flavors
yet
is
very
easy
to
enjoy
thin
is
a
nice
malty
englishstyle
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
very
sessionable
very
nice
and
not
overpriced
draft
at
goose
island
clybourn
brewpub
a
very
dark
brown
little
head
or
carbonation
weak
aroma
decent
maltiness
in
the
flavour
this
was
a
reasonable
brew
and
fits
in
well
with
their
profile
of
low
carbonation
beers
i
was
pretty
happy
with
the
range
of
beers
from
this
brewery
this
evening
d
excellent
easy
drinking
wellrounded
brown
ale
d
very
nice
brown
ale
that
is
extremely
drinkable
awesome
session
brown
ale
poured
a
rich
dark
brown
color
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
thin
head
that
remained
for
the
duration
and
the
lacing
was
modest
at
best
very
aromatic
brew
giving
off
hints
of
dark
roasted
malts
the
aroma
was
malty
sweet
nutty
and
even
a
tad
bit
hoppy
drinks
easily
and
is
very
smooth
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
chock
full
of
good
flavors
that
meld
together
very
well
good
finish
which
makes
this
dark
ale
easily
drinkable
the
flavor
of
this
seems
to
lean
closer
to
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
but
either
way
this
is
simply
fantastic
very
good
brown
ale
just
the
way
i
like
them
like
many
of
the
other
goose
island
beers
its
highly
drinkable
poured
to
a
good
slight
brown
head
ale
was
brownish
black
in
color
had
some
decent
lacing
that
left
rings
around
glass
with
every
swallow
a
little
head
stayed
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
had
a
nutty
sweet
chocolate
smell
with
a
slight
coffee
smell
maybe
a
hint
of
alcohol
tasted
of
malt
and
caramel
i
thought
it
was
also
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
flavor
of
burnt
coffee
hung
around
for
a
while
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonaation
was
right
i
dont
think
i
could
make
this
a
session
beer
but
i
will
buy
this
again
d
really
good
and
delicious
easy
to
drink
id
enjoy
many
more
of
these
if
i
had
them
this
beer
will
only
improve
with
some
increase
in
temperature
i
would
recommend
letting
this
bottle
warm
before
pouring
it
to
a
glass
to
get
the
most
enjoyment
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
small
head
on
a
very
dark
brown
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
smell
caramel
and
perhaps
honey
a
smooth
beer
on
the
tongue
featuring
nicely
the
caramel
coffee
and
nuttiness
typically
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
one
is
quite
good
glad
i
picked
it
up
very
drinkable
brew
could
throw
these
back
all
night
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
1
12
in
cream
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
rich
with
honey
nutmeg
and
some
slight
burnt
caramel
the
flavor
is
subtle
with
notes
of
caramel
sweetness
from
honey
and
dark
malts
i
dont
notice
the
chocolate
i
expected
in
the
flavor
a
little
more
burnt
malts
medium
body
light
carbonation
this
is
a
good
session
brew
very
enjoyable
overall
this
was
a
good
nut
brown
from
goose
island
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
this
isnt
too
bad
the
flavor
is
too
weak
though
and
although
this
is
easy
to
drink
i
wish
the
flavor
were
more
robust
it
took
a
little
while
to
finish
this
and
i
dont
think
id
revisit
it
just
based
on
personal
preference
especially
considering
its
a
style
i
like
it
gets
points
for
being
unique
but
its
not
my
thing
a
good
ale
i
would
look
for
it
again
goos
island
scores
again
this
is
one
i
wont
pass
by
any
longer
why
ive
overlooked
the
excellent
goose
island
wares
i
have
no
idea
ive
sampled
lots
of
different
beers
somewhat
at
the
expense
of
a
very
good
local
brewery
no
more
for
goose
island
continues
to
accrue
points
in
my
ledger
prefect
drinkability
would
be
good
to
session
the
nose
of
the
beer
smells
of
a
dark
chocolate
with
hints
of
something
sweet
probably
caramel
the
beer
tastes
like
chocolate
with
a
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
dark
roasts
the
sweetness
is
hidden
under
the
chocolate
and
its
quite
pleasing
it
has
a
nice
bittering
taste
that
makes
you
want
to
have
another
drink
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
but
it
isnt
too
bad
the
beer
is
a
bit
creamy
as
well
very
drinkable
living
in
chicago
we
often
take
goose
island
for
granted
especially
something
like
this
nut
brown
ale
but
really
it
is
a
special
beer
or
at
least
this
sample
is
if
you
paired
this
with
pecan
pie
youd
have
yourself
one
helluva
great
dessert
give
it
a
try
recommended
md
relatively
light
mouthfeel
like
i
said
before
its
not
overwhelmingly
strong
nor
is
it
too
carbonated
so
its
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
d
i
found
myself
drink
this
really
quickly
so
maybe
it
has
some
good
qualities
but
it
doesnt
make
me
want
to
have
another
after
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
offer
anything
special
and
is
a
bit
weak
in
flavor
and
body
good
carbonation
medium
body
good
beer
maybe
could
do
a
session
i
will
get
this
mix
pack
again
in
the
future
follows
style
mfd
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
not
a
bad
beer
it
went
down
well
i
just
wish
it
had
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
drinkability
a
very
pleasant
ale
not
remarkable
in
any
sense
but
has
no
outright
flaws
it
fits
the
bill
well
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
ton
of
this
bottle
courtesy
of
indybigtom
poured
a
clear
deep
brown
color
ale
with
good
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
subtle
notes
of
nuts
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
nutty
caramel
malt
with
a
dry
ending
with
limited
hops
presence
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
well
done
session
ale
the
taste
is
really
earthy
with
tons
of
caramel
malt
and
that
same
nice
nuttiness
its
integrated
well
if
theres
one
thing
i
hate
about
brown
ales
its
that
theyre
often
basically
simple
roasted
malt
with
horrible
nutty
twang
the
beer
has
some
sweetness
to
it
also
which
balances
well
dthis
is
a
good
drinking
englishstyle
brown
ale
a
bit
lacking
in
total
depth
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
tasted
on
21208
pours
a
rusty
orangeish
brown
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
is
completely
gone
within
thirty
seconds
smells
of
sweet
and
roasty
malts
with
a
mild
tinge
of
chocolate
medium
bodied
but
it
is
a
tad
thinner
than
id
like
taste
is
sweet
caramel
roasty
bit
of
chocolate
bit
of
coffee
mild
hops
with
a
dry
finish
highly
drinkable
for
a
sweet
beer
relative
to
the
limited
world
of
nut
brown
ales
this
is
a
good
brew
that
is
not
too
pricey
certainly
worth
a
taste
if
you
like
the
style
basically
black
with
a
hint
of
ruby
brown
and
a
fluffy
beige
head
nice
fairly
complex
smell
for
a
brown
nice
mild
roastiness
touch
of
coffee
cream
and
nutty
taste
is
quite
nice
with
same
flavors
coming
through
smooth
a
touch
watery
yet
almost
creamy
at
the
same
time
couldnt
decide
where
the
mouthfeel
stood
exactly
but
the
beer
overall
was
quite
good
and
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
ive
had
pours
a
deep
amber
brownish
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
nutty
and
sweet
hints
of
caramel
in
the
taste
sweet
nutty
maltiness
and
a
small
stickiness
a
medium
bodied
and
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
nutty
and
malty
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
brown
non
offensive
a
nice
big
nutty
presence
good
beer
all
of
gis
standards
are
solid
dig
the
mouthfeel
i
would
drink
this
hometowner
anytime
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
shows
some
light
head
is
very
thick
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
forms
on
the
way
down
flavor
is
smooth
noticeable
sweet
edge
almost
like
honey
upon
first
impression
nice
malted
aspects
as
well
nothing
really
crazy
going
on
here
but
it
is
definitely
smooth
good
feel
on
all
levels
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
notes
great
session
beer
pairs
well
with
many
foods
usually
on
the
blander
side
although
i
suppose
it
can
hold
its
own
in
a
lot
of
situations
damn
good
beer
d
i
am
enjoying
this
one
good
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
sweet
but
not
too
much
i
could
drink
a
couple
in
a
row
better
than
bmcs
though
there
are
better
english
browns
just
as
accessible
in
chicago
with
the
big
liquor
stores
opening
up
all
i
can
say
is
ive
had
worse
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
good
nut
flavor
d
complex
flavors
and
a
low
abv
make
this
very
sessionable
ive
been
drinking
this
since
the
early
days
of
goose
island
when
this
was
known
as
hex
nut
brown
ale
and
i
have
to
say
this
has
gotten
much
better
as
time
has
marched
on
nut
brown
is
a
good
way
to
describe
this
one
as
roasted
nut
flavor
dominates
the
palate
there
is
a
musty
sweetness
here
as
well
and
bitterness
is
kept
to
a
minimum
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
and
is
mediumfull
a
quality
brown
ale
that
lives
up
to
its
name
poured
a
nice
attractive
brown
color
with
garnet
highlights
and
tan
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
aroma
was
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
was
also
of
chocolate
coffee
and
also
some
nuttiness
to
it
at
first
i
found
this
a
tad
thin
but
remembered
this
is
not
a
porter
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
with
great
drinkability
d
this
one
is
a
smooth
brown
ale
that
goes
down
fairly
easy
drinkability
is
good
was
hoping
for
a
nuttier
presence
in
this
but
still
this
is
actually
one
of
the
better
nut
browns
that
ive
tried
eminently
drinkable
and
sessionable
if
i
could
get
this
in
tn
i
would
drink
this
nice
beer
the
beer
has
a
solid
malt
backbone
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
finish
is
ever
so
slighty
bittersweet
it
has
a
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
a
nice
satisfying
beer
d
this
beer
is
niether
overly
sweet
or
bitter
its
pretty
well
balanced
in
all
aspects
but
they
seem
to
blend
together
a
bit
to
much
where
it
takes
quite
a
bit
of
work
to
seperate
the
things
happening
on
your
pallate
a
complex
beer
to
be
sure
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
progression
from
sweet
to
bitter
rather
than
it
happening
all
at
the
same
time
d
good
beer
nice
and
light
with
good
flavor
pours
a
very
dark
color
color
with
a
brownish
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
coffee
the
taste
is
good
once
again
goose
island
gives
us
another
all
around
good
beer
has
a
good
malty
taste
alcohol
is
balanced
well
mouthfell
is
good
has
a
full
body
to
it
but
the
best
part
is
the
drinkability
ive
gone
through
4
in
like
2
hours
easy
drinking
good
beer
with
a
good
taste
recommended
mouthfeel
average
carbonation
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
overall
a
session
beer
for
sure
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
too
subtle
for
me
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
lighter
beer
its
not
bad
seems
a
little
pricey
for
what
seems
like
a
jazzed
up
macro
d
delicious
robust
but
smooth
rich
but
not
too
filling
this
is
one
nice
session
beer
i
felt
it
had
too
much
flavor
for
a
nut
brown
actually
reminded
me
more
of
a
porter
or
a
mini
stout
full
flavor
medium
bodied
pours
an
opaque
black
has
some
chocolatey
notes
and
some
nuts
not
to
mention
coffee
nice
on
a
november
day
watching
some
thanksgiving
football
with
the
roasted
almonds
this
is
a
nice
offering
pours
a
rich
brown
with
little
head
into
a
small
snifter
aroma
is
of
roastednutty
malts
and
not
much
else
smells
tasty
taste
is
more
of
the
same
malt
flavors
a
little
sweetness
then
a
nice
dry
finish
with
good
mouth
feel
and
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
little
brown
ale
a
nice
chocolate
dark
brown
color
to
it
when
it
pours
very
opaque
as
not
much
light
filters
through
it
has
a
bought
a
thumb
of
thick
milky
brown
frothy
head
can
smell
a
little
bit
of
the
chocolate
coming
through
the
beer
goes
down
pretty
smooth
not
a
very
thick
brew
good
taste
too
it
kind
of
a
sweet
taste
almost
a
bit
caramely
in
my
opinion
leaves
a
nice
smooth
feeling
on
the
tongue
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
definitely
has
some
character
to
it
and
i
could
see
having
a
couple
after
a
heavy
dinner
pours
a
nice
small
head
that
receeds
quickly
with
little
lace
that
disappears
unlike
other
gi
this
one
doesnt
hold
foamy
head
and
lace
like
others
very
dark
brown
ale
smell
is
of
toffee
coffee
mollassis
it
also
smells
creamy
if
it
can
smell
creamy
taste
is
creamy
for
sure
with
coffee
on
palate
this
brown
ale
puts
samual
smith
and
new
castle
to
shame
my
favorite
nut
brown
i
have
tasted
yet
very
drinkable
session
beer
that
goes
well
with
a
chicago
bears
victory
dits
okay
a
little
more
complexity
and
hop
character
would
be
welcome
this
is
one
of
my
fav
styles
of
beer
and
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
brew
just
as
i
am
not
really
impressed
with
many
of
goose
islands
brews
served
in
a
pint
glass
a
deep
brown
liquid
with
an
off
white
head
that
left
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
i
taste
what
i
smell
coffee
roasted
malt
and
slight
hop
taste
finished
dry
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
i
would
and
have
sessioned
this
i
dont
really
know
the
difference
between
an
english
brown
ale
or
an
american
brown
ale
but
my
reference
for
a
perfect
brown
ale
to
date
is
mt
carmel
nut
brown
ale
that
one
is
categorized
as
an
american
brown
ale
drinkability
flavorful
and
quite
drinkable
this
is
what
i
want
in
a
brown
ale
d
very
drinkable
nothing
too
overwhelming
just
alot
of
flavor
balanced
just
right
into
a
beer
that
tastes
like
it
should
be
lighter
in
color
very
drinkable
even
people
that
dont
like
darker
beers
should
give
this
one
a
shot
because
its
so
pleasantly
sweet
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
brew
with
a
big
light
brown
head
that
stayed
pretty
well
down
to
a
solid
ring
at
the
end
some
lace
a
big
warm
aroma
of
molassesbrown
sugar
and
as
advertized
some
toasted
nuts
i
smell
a
hint
of
raisins
as
well
the
flavor
is
fairly
true
to
the
aroma
a
little
more
toward
malt
and
caramel
the
carbonation
died
a
little
early
i
thought
so
it
got
a
bit
watery
near
the
end
a
solid
flavor
and
reasonably
drinkable
a
pretty
pleasant
taste
experience
but
it
didnt
finish
as
well
as
i
would
have
hoped
drinkability
is
very
high
not
a
strong
overpowering
ale
nor
is
it
watery
and
tasteless
very
impressed
could
be
a
session
beer
if
one
truly
enjoys
brown
ales
this
is
one
beer
i
picked
up
by
chance
and
will
look
for
it
more
than
once
more
very
drinkable
beer
and
good
winter
beer
one
of
my
faves
and
the
first
five
in
my
book
smell
is
very
malty
and
a
bit
earthy
almost
smells
like
a
glass
of
unsweet
tea
with
perhaps
some
ground
oats
in
it
taste
too
is
very
very
malty
with
loads
of
toasted
cereal
profiles
this
seems
bereft
of
any
hops
at
all
in
fact
it
is
also
quite
sweet
which
is
why
i
placed
drinkability
at
3
0
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
that
i
like
very
much
and
could
perhaps
be
sessionable
if
by
sessionable
you
mean
around
three
the
sweetness
on
the
finish
in
this
one
would
most
likely
prevent
me
from
having
more
than
four
of
these
at
the
most
in
a
sitting
i
did
really
enjoy
it
though
deep
brown
ale
almost
dopplebock
brown
the
body
is
a
bit
more
present
than
id
like
although
its
still
quite
enjoyable
and
refreshing
carbonation
fades
after
about
10
minutes
nutty
and
malty
with
a
gentle
noble
bitterness
slightly
tangy
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
lift
the
body
a
little
this
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
hair
very
english
interpretation
of
the
style
right
down
to
the
estery
yeast
this
would
make
a
great
candidate
for
the
hand
pump
very
good
although
perhaps
a
bit
too
filling
to
be
a
session
ale
cheers
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
just
a
little
lacing
scent
is
good
lots
of
nutty
malt
some
spices
and
a
little
hops
taste
catches
you
first
with
the
roasted
nuts
and
malt
some
mild
spiciness
a
little
bit
of
a
watery
taste
shows
up
every
so
often
but
overall
a
good
flavor
that
roasted
malt
taste
sits
throughout
feel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
overall
a
good
beer
that
wont
knock
you
over
with
its
flavor
but
it
aint
too
bad
either
good
session
overall
a
decent
beer
just
not
really
my
style
like
this
and
remember
when
it
was
hex
nut
i
think
will
read
other
stuff
to
confirm
have
another
yes
i
will
thank
you
not
too
great
in
the
taste
department
its
balanced
alright
i
wouldnt
be
angry
with
a
few
more
hops
but
the
taste
is
pretty
minimal
not
a
bad
english
version
of
the
style
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
darker
than
most
brown
ales
ive
seen
lacing
is
good
but
the
head
retention
isnt
it
smells
like
caramel
roasted
maltgrains
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
it
tastes
like
caramel
nuts
and
roasted
malt
i
think
it
has
a
good
mix
of
sweet
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
but
not
watery
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
i
think
this
is
an
ok
beer
good
but
not
great
but
its
certainly
drinkable
overall
impression
browns
dont
impress
me
but
this
one
stands
out
i
liked
the
malt
complexity
and
the
aroma
this
is
interesting
and
highly
sessionable
if
there
were
more
examples
out
there
like
this
id
be
a
much
bigger
fan
of
english
browns
strongly
recommended
lowmedium
body
a
really
nice
clean
session
beer
this
one
seems
to
have
been
made
as
an
easydrinker
a
patio
session
ale
that
might
appeal
to
a
wider
market
especially
since
the
brown
ale
style
is
fairly
unassuming
much
of
the
time
and
can
be
used
as
a
decent
stepping
stone
into
ales
many
thanks
to
rudge75
and
fisherman34
for
the
sample
smell
is
muted
what
is
there
is
malty
and
sweet
taste
is
sort
of
like
almonds
i
guess
thats
where
the
nut
part
comes
from
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
just
a
very
average
beer
although
i
would
say
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
it
does
sit
a
little
thin
as
it
lacks
points
in
the
smell
and
taste
arena
if
you
can
get
past
the
subtilty
this
could
be
sessioned
easily
decent
mouthfeel
but
overall
i
expected
more
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
lightly
carbonated
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
could
easily
be
sessioned
i
am
not
an
expert
by
any
means
but
it
seems
to
be
just
about
an
average
beer
for
this
style
very
dark
brown
almost
opaque
less
than
a
finger
of
tan
head
aroma
is
full
or
chocolate
with
a
little
coffee
and
caramel
smells
like
this
could
be
warmed
and
served
at
starbucks
rich
malty
flavor
with
a
strong
coffee
aftertaste
there
is
some
chocolate
in
the
flavor
too
along
with
some
toast
and
nuts
full
creamy
mouthfeel
and
lightly
carbonated
this
is
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
nut
brown
ales
that
ive
had
and
look
forward
to
having
some
more
of
these
a
pretty
good
showing
overall
and
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
goose
island
very
dark
amber
minimal
lacing
and
head
their
ipa
is
growing
on
me
more
and
more
but
the
aftertaste
on
this
one
is
a
little
off
for
me
heavy
malt
more
metallic
than
nutty
its
a
quality
beer
just
not
my
taste
id
take
their
honkers
over
this
it
also
feels
a
bit
watered
down
easy
to
drink
but
not
exactly
remarkable
beer
was
almost
hazlenut
colored
which
i
suppose
would
be
fitting
for
a
nut
brown
ale
smell
was
nutty
slightly
yeasty
with
a
certain
sharpness
to
it
taste
was
nutty
slightly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
yeastyness
the
carbonation
was
almost
too
much
but
that
may
just
be
for
my
personal
tastes
mouthfeel
wasnt
bad
beer
felt
light
despite
the
somewhat
intense
flavor
only
real
downside
was
the
sharpness
and
carbonation
whlie
the
beer
was
certainly
drinkable
the
downsides
hurt
the
drinkability
a
bit
i
could
see
some
people
loving
this
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
im
not
in
any
rush
to
try
this
one
again
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
brown
with
a
offwhitetan
onefinger
milky
head
smell
is
slightly
nutty
carmel
and
toasted
malts
also
present
taste
is
initially
sweet
with
the
nutty
toasted
carmel
notes
comming
out
balanced
nicely
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
smooth
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
with
a
good
amount
of
creamy
carbonation
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
probably
my
favorite
so
far
by
goose
island
a
very
solid
nut
brown
ale
over
all
it
was
a
smooth
nut
brown
but
it
lacked
flavor
another
good
product
from
goose
island
but
not
one
of
their
best
it
is
semisweet
richly
malted
with
strong
brown
sugarcaramel
over
tones
its
appearance
is
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
very
light
and
minimal
foam
it
has
a
very
strong
roasted
coffee
caramel
smell
it
drinks
easily
lightly
carbonated
and
finishes
semisweet
that
being
said
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
are
going
to
strongly
like
or
not
it
has
a
strong
character
another
trade
from
jhammerly
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
some
carbonation
not
much
of
a
head
basically
no
lacing
at
all
scents
of
sweet
malts
slight
hops
roasted
nuts
some
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
of
roasted
sweet
nutsmalts
nice
little
bitter
bite
in
the
finish
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
little
brew
from
gi
d
this
is
another
great
session
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
tap
the
next
time
im
a
little
further
north
d
another
solid
session
brew
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
without
my
palate
yelling
mercy
very
enjoyable
beer
from
goose
island
was
advised
that
this
was
an
exceptional
brown
ale
as
far
as
browns
go
this
one
is
ok
but
i
wouldnt
say
exceptional
pours
a
deep
mohagany
brown
with
thin
tan
head
and
minimal
lacing
smells
strong
of
expresso
nuts
and
a
hint
of
tobacco
the
taste
is
very
coffee
flavored
with
tobacco
hints
rolling
along
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
but
decent
overall
not
something
i
would
purchase
regularly
but
a
solid
brown
the
pours
is
deep
brown
very
little
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
which
was
surprising
the
aroma
is
nice
combination
of
bitter
and
sweet
flavors
are
a
very
enjoyable
blend
of
chocolate
and
a
presence
of
honey
a
mellow
caramel
flavor
is
present
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
sweet
drinkablity
is
also
good
overall
this
is
a
fine
nut
brown
ale
another
winner
from
goose
island
i
could
have
a
couple
but
i
most
definitely
must
be
in
the
mood
a
change
of
pace
type
brew
although
there
are
other
brown
ales
id
purchase
before
this
one
like
a
lot
of
goose
island
beers
this
one
isnt
over
the
top
but
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
ill
definately
enjoy
it
again
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
this
opportunity
i
wouldnt
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
but
like
one
every
now
and
again
worth
trying
nothing
too
great
though
drinkability
this
is
very
good
ale
and
very
sessionable
a
very
drinkable
brown
that
would
make
quite
a
nice
session
brew
too
bad
i
only
have
one
roasted
coffee
with
cream
and
sugar
accompanied
by
peanut
overtones
dominate
the
palate
in
this
smooth
and
creamy
nut
brown
which
resembles
a
porter
to
my
mouth
highly
drinkable
and
very
interesting
there
is
enough
going
on
here
to
keep
me
interested
for
the
duration
of
more
than
one
beer
but
nothing
overpowers
the
senses
a
sessioner
for
sure
this
is
a
top
brown
ale
imo
goose
island
keeps
on
impressing
me
and
so
close
to
home
overall
a
decent
brown
that
i
like
to
pick
up
every
once
in
a
while
but
you
would
not
want
drink
a
bunch
in
one
sitting
as
it
is
sort
of
rich
d
a
tasty
brew
no
doubt
but
too
rich
to
drink
a
lot
of
at
one
time
but
certainly
worth
having
on
hand
pours
a
very
clear
deep
rubybrown
with
redorange
highlights
creamy
three
finger
head
offwhite
shows
good
retention
that
leaves
sticky
patches
of
lace
malty
aroma
of
mild
and
brown
malt
toasted
crystal
and
some
faint
leafy
english
hops
in
the
background
sweet
crystal
and
pale
malt
upfront
some
roasted
notes
and
an
earthy
fuggles
hop
flavor
slight
drying
in
the
aftertaste
english
hop
bitterness
is
assertve
but
fairly
balanced
the
medium
body
and
carbonation
give
it
a
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
that
is
devoid
of
diacetyl
but
not
overly
dry
and
is
properly
dried
by
a
fresh
hop
presence
finishes
mild
with
hints
of
toasty
brown
malts
and
herbal
hops
very
drinkable
an
excellent
american
interpretation
of
the
style
not
a
bad
ale
the
cloying
sweetness
subtract
from
drinkability
points
the
heavy
use
of
roasted
malts
almost
takes
this
ale
out
of
the
brown
ale
category
just
the
same
the
complexity
and
smoothness
are
very
pleasant
making
this
a
nice
after
dinner
ale
pours
a
deep
brown
with
slight
amounts
of
red
coming
through
the
filtered
light
head
is
minimal
perhaps
i
poured
it
too
gingerly
but
the
head
retention
is
very
good
considering
the
minimal
head
that
initially
occupied
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
great
i
love
it
immediately
i
notice
a
smell
of
chocolate
and
perhaps
hazelnut
tastes
pretty
good
slightly
too
heavy
to
drink
too
much
of
but
definately
a
nice
beer
to
drink
to
enjoy
the
taste
rather
than
the
effects
of
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
unpleasant
thing
about
this
beer
to
me
as
it
is
very
carbonated
and
gives
that
miller
high
life
like
slight
burn
mfd
mouth
is
slightly
drying
but
overall
pretty
moderate
and
smooth
overall
i
would
say
this
is
way
too
malty
and
not
very
balanced
but
it
is
interesting
enough
to
be
enjoyable
everynow
and
then
ordered
this
ontap
at
goose
island
in
chicago
poured
a
clear
reddishbrown
with
a
mediumsized
offwhite
head
head
heavy
lacing
smelled
nutty
and
malty
hints
of
lightroasted
coffee
overall
sweet
quality
to
the
aromas
as
well
as
the
flavors
dominate
tastes
of
the
malt
plus
a
light
nutty
character
hints
of
sweet
sugar
or
caramel
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
adds
up
to
a
very
smooth
and
pleasant
flavor
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
this
one
went
down
really
easy
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
i
would
say
a
very
good
choice
for
a
couple
of
beers
on
the
patio
notesdrinkability
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
brown
ale
one
of
the
best
i
have
partaken
of
in
quite
awhile
well
worth
the
pick
up
and
is
my
favorite
goose
island
beer
to
date
but
its
the
taste
that
wins
this
beer
gets
you
at
hello
and
you
dont
want
it
to
stop
talking
to
you
until
youve
had
a
fully
engaging
conversation
with
it
by
then
your
glass
is
half
empty
deliciouslybut
not
overlysweet
with
warm
suggestions
of
honey
and
chocolate
a
very
slight
suggestion
of
coffee
and
the
vaguest
hint
of
an
oreo
cookie
generously
swiped
through
a
jar
of
nutella
in
fact
given
all
the
parallels
this
beer
comes
deceptively
close
to
the
stoutstyle
save
the
color
this
beer
from
goose
island
triggers
memories
of
a
longtime
favorite
of
mine
trader
joes
stockyard
stout
and
it
has
been
purported
on
this
website
that
goose
island
does
the
actual
brewing
and
bottling
of
tjs
ss
there
are
many
similarities
in
flavor
between
the
two
minus
graham
crackers
minus
port
wine
cheese
plus
smoked
chipotle
peppers
plus
grilled
pork
tenderloin
with
peachmango
salsa
minus
pours
a
dark
browngarnet
with
a
scant
khaki
head
nose
is
chiefly
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
earthiness
taste
starts
off
with
burnt
darkcoffee
malts
earthy
nuttiness
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
milky
toffee
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
and
a
little
overly
crisp
but
still
remains
a
drinkable
brown
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
tried
after
newcastle
got
me
off
the
american
macroswill
a
tasty
little
brown
indeed
if
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
pretty
drinkable
but
fairly
onedimensional
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
a
solid
brew
that
doent
have
anything
to
offend
drinkability
not
bad
except
for
the
distracting
carbonation
level
i
enjoyed
it
at
the
old
chicago
in
manhattan
ks
verdict
the
body
is
fine
but
it
doesnt
have
a
rich
depth
of
malt
flavor
the
hops
and
the
estery
flavors
end
up
sticking
out
the
most
a
deep
dark
brown
color
that
is
slightly
transparent
it
has
a
lite
caramel
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
the
sweet
smell
of
malt
is
very
strong
folowed
by
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
of
each
scent
the
taste
is
very
good
the
seet
malt
and
the
nuttiness
from
the
roasted
barley
blend
well
together
in
the
mouth
it
feels
a
tad
rich
and
bit
chewy
but
is
very
good
goin
down
the
only
down
fall
is
maybe
a
tad
to
much
carbonation
the
beer
overall
is
very
good
it
makes
want
to
order
some
welsh
rabbit
and
sit
in
an
english
style
pub
pours
ruby
brown
with
a
moderate
head
and
only
some
hints
of
lacing
aroma
is
grainy
kinda
like
biscuits
toasty
taste
is
malty
kind
of
rich
minerally
if
thats
a
word
nothing
outstanding
but
better
than
a
newcastle
i
do
find
this
beer
to
be
rather
highly
carbonated
and
that
is
disracting
to
me
but
it
does
strike
me
as
a
very
sessionable
beer
to
enjoy
pretty
decent
beer
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
burnt
toffee
and
caramel
its
smooth
with
a
dry
nutty
aroma
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
dry
yet
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
victory
malts
its
full
of
malty
flavor
but
its
a
little
too
dry
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
brown
ale
its
got
a
nice
malty
taste
and
a
wonderful
aroma
drinkability
the
beer
is
a
very
solid
drinker
this
beer
has
remained
in
my
drinking
line
up
for
a
long
time
dwonderful
i
love
this
beer
due
to
the
chocolate
that
i
could
taste
and
will
return
often
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
good
sized
persistant
head
which
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
a
few
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
which
adds
complexity
and
bitterness
there
are
some
faint
chocolate
and
fruit
notes
this
beer
has
a
nice
medium
body
and
is
quite
drinkable
mouthfeel
for
a
darker
beer
this
was
a
very
light
to
maybe
medium
bodied
beer
definetly
a
session
beer
for
me
d
i
would
drink
it
again
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
like
most
other
beers
id
drink
it
again
if
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
it
or
if
i
were
in
a
bar
and
there
were
nothing
better
on
tap
it
goes
down
well
and
is
very
satisfying
but
i
do
crave
more
flavor
and
more
booze
an
allaround
great
brown
ale
tasty
and
easying
drinking
id
really
like
to
try
this
ontap
drinkabilty
superbly
drinkable
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
worth
seeking
out
d
good
brew
from
goose
exceeded
my
expectations
and
ill
probably
be
drinking
more
of
it
this
is
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
them
in
a
bottle
thats
not
in
the
reserve
series
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
to
drink
when
you
want
something
a
little
sweet
the
sweetness
dominates
initially
but
the
bitterness
balances
out
after
the
first
sip
d
having
only
one
of
these
in
my
fridge
was
a
bummer
i
really
did
want
another
maybe
2
as
quick
as
it
goes
down
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
very
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
small
beige
head
and
small
flecks
of
oily
lacing
smell
is
very
faint
roasted
malts
and
light
coffee
accents
taste
follows
suit
with
a
bit
more
robust
flavor
than
i
expected
but
still
has
a
pretty
light
mouthfeel
overall
ive
never
been
too
impressed
by
the
style
but
ive
had
better
nut
browns
than
this
not
unoffensive
in
any
aspect
but
nothing
to
write
home
to
mom
about
worth
a
try
sure
why
not
my
wife
brought
this
one
along
with
some
other
goose
island
beers
back
to
pa
after
a
family
visit
in
illinois
this
one
was
brownish
in
color
with
ruby
red
hues
little
head
when
poured
and
little
lacing
as
i
drank
it
malts
are
sweet
smelling
along
with
nutty
and
caramel
aromas
dark
fruits
are
also
present
prunes
and
raisins
but
also
a
little
metal
somewhat
like
a
kitchen
sink
taste
is
very
nutty
but
some
caramel
taste
gives
it
a
little
sweetness
seems
thin
but
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
exited
the
bottle
and
displayed
a
brilliant
deep
brown
colour
a
moderately
aggressive
poor
yielded
about
a
finger
of
sticky
looking
tan
head
the
head
held
fast
for
some
time
as
i
examined
the
properties
of
appearance
the
nose
was
not
overly
aromatic
but
it
held
some
subtle
and
pleasant
scents
of
chocolate
and
musty
nuttiness
the
taste
was
very
mild
and
soothing
as
i
find
most
brown
ales
to
be
chocolate
and
caramel
tones
were
notable
as
proclaimed
on
the
label
soft
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
overtones
of
graininess
filled
the
air
as
well
there
was
also
an
oily
nut
character
that
combined
well
with
the
other
flavours
the
mouthfeel
was
fluffy
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
oily
slickness
very
drinkable
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
creaminess
and
active
carbonation
this
one
goes
down
easily
and
packs
in
plenty
of
flavor
as
well
i
could
easily
see
myself
sitting
down
to
a
session
with
this
one
another
tasty
goose
brew
that
i
have
neglected
for
too
long
a
smooth
rich
brew
lightly
effervescent
it
flows
across
the
palate
tongue
and
leaves
behind
a
wonderfully
rich
malty
dark
chocolate
aftertaste
absolutely
fabulous
beer
perfectly
balanced
and
amazingly
complex
full
bodied
thick
with
a
carbonation
kick
just
a
strong
performer
in
the
english
brown
ale
arena
a
good
brown
ale
but
id
go
for
arcadia
instead
poured
out
to
a
dark
cherry
brown
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
was
of
an
off
white
color
aromas
were
light
and
hard
to
detect
but
traces
of
caramel
and
sweet
malts
were
detected
taste
was
better
than
mass
produced
brown
ales
new
castle
but
lacked
character
and
depth
flavors
of
lightly
roasted
nuts
medium
bodied
malts
and
mild
herbs
and
watery
coffee
seemed
to
be
the
extent
of
what
i
could
make
out
mouthfeel
was
good
and
medium
bodied
a
good
level
of
drinkability
i
just
expected
more
flavor
and
depth
from
a
brewery
as
good
as
goose
island
worth
a
try
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
light
not
quite
white
head
solid
malt
aroma
with
good
earthy
hop
tones
the
malt
has
decent
complexity
with
some
slight
chocolate
and
some
good
toasted
bread
accents
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
as
well
bitterness
is
there
hops
are
there
yeasty
finish
and
of
course
some
malt
not
overly
sweet
grainy
and
slightly
burnt
bread
the
body
is
solid
i
dont
get
a
nutty
finish
as
much
as
i
do
toasty
a
well
made
brown
ale
a
far
tastier
choice
than
newcastle
this
beer
pours
a
very
nice
deep
dark
red
color
with
a
small
tan
head
beautiful
color
the
smell
is
mainly
chocolate
and
caramel
with
some
malt
present
as
well
very
nice
it
tastes
similar
to
the
smell
mostly
caramel
and
malt
with
a
little
tartness
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
as
well
nice
and
medium
bodied
there
is
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
but
it
adds
nicely
to
it
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
they
sold
it
in
my
state
as
id
gladly
enjoy
one
now
and
again
a
straightforward
and
immensely
enjoyable
ale
the
texture
is
quite
smooth
and
velvety
with
a
medium
body
a
slight
bitterness
envelops
the
mouth
from
the
nutty
earthy
roastiness
and
maybe
even
some
hops
though
none
are
immediately
identifyable
drinkable
though
probably
not
a
brown
i
will
be
buying
again
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
lagre
creamy
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
creamy
nutty
and
sweet
it
is
very
pleasant
but
rather
faint
the
taste
is
of
cream
and
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
but
leans
toward
the
thinner
side
of
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
it
will
do
if
nothing
better
is
available
dthis
beer
is
nice
to
drink
ice
cold
but
as
it
warms
slightly
more
of
the
harsher
malt
qualities
come
through
it
has
a
little
tanginess
to
it
in
the
finish
and
the
watery
mouthfeel
comes
through
stronger
good
body
and
limited
carbonation
very
smooth
in
flavor
but
limited
malt
taste
it
has
an
american
feel
than
more
of
a
traditional
dark
ale
good
taste
and
enjoyable
although
not
a
very
complicated
brew
it
gets
the
job
done
very
drinkable
a
good
nut
brown
however
i
think
i
got
an
expired
bottle
opens
up
with
nich
roasted
aroma
followed
by
hop
chocolate
and
pecan

most
of
which
were

try
a

really
like
this
beer
nice
flavors
and
aromas
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
its
beers
like
this
that
proves
that
goose
island
is
a
great
brewery
the
fact
that
they
can
consistently
produce
beers
like
this
even
as
they
grow
larger
shows
that
it
can
be
done

im
not
a

fan
despite
it
being
the
most
readily
available
micro
in

but
all
things
considered
this
is
quite
a
nice
ale
pours
an
attractive
dark
caramel
color
catches
the
light
well
good

smells
like
cooked

cabbagelike
tastes
the
same
upfront
but
with
a
really
nice

husk
bitterness
to
save
it
from
being
completely
dull
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
more
before
i
started
trying
a
bunch
of
different
kinds
of
brown
ales
its
a
good
jumpingoff
point
this
poured
a
nice
dark
caramelchocolate
with
hints
of
crimson
and
had
a
nice
fluffy
tanbeige
head
with
large
bubbles
the
aroma
was
of
toasted
malt
caramel
honey
and
a
slight
astringency
on
the
end
it
had
a
taste
of
roasted
malt
molasses
burnt
caramel
charcoal
and
oak
but
when
i
wasnt
looking
it
hit
me
with
the
flavor
of
a
very
creamy
chocomochachino
ice
cream
the
mouthfeel
was
very
slick
and
creamy
light
on
the
pallette
with
little
carbination
overall
this
is
a
very
topnotch
nut
brown
ale
id
enjoy
this
as
a
session
beer
also
due
to
its
low
abv

a

well
carbonated
i
havent
had
an
opportunity
to
try
anything
from
this
brewery
in
the
past
as
they
dont
ship
to

however
im
in
indiana
and
picked
up
a
6pack
i
will
definately
be
buying
some
more
to
take

nice
on

the
feel
was
a

with

this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
it
was
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
nice
beer
all
around

with
a
frothy
beige

a

some

not

be
fooling

is
roast

at

nice

also

a

finish
hops
is
barely
noticeable
if
its
even
in
there
mouthfeel
is
quite
bold
especially
given
the
mildness
of
the
brew
this
is
very
drinkable
and
a
fine
session
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
seemingly
about
any
preferences
this
ale
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
minimal
tan
head
i
smelled
roasted
malt
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
i
was
surprised
to
find
less
roasted
taste
than
smell
it
finishes
with
a
bit
of

it

not

for
the

but
who
cares
when
it
tastes
good
solid
drinkable
brew
seems
to
be
closer
to
american
brown
ale
in
flavor
though
drinkability
this
is
a
fine
brown
ale
one
i
will
definitely
have
again
and
will
have
to
let
friends
try
to
introduce
them
to
the
style
in
addition
to
the
empyrean
version
this
beer
is
a
brilliantly
clear
deepdark
rubyamber
color
the
head
is
frothy
and
a
tan
color
the
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malt
notes
sweet
caramel
coffee
and
grain
husks
the
taste
is
full
and
malty
sweet
and
has
lots
of
caramelized
malt
notes
to
it
this
beer
is
also
nicely
fruity
with
notes
of
raisin
and
fig
interestingly
enough
this
beer
is
not
nearly
as
roasty
in
character
as
the
aroma
suggested
it
has
a
bit
of
lightly
toasted
graininess
to
it
and
a
hint
of
roasted
grain
husks
but
these
are
far
from
being
dominant
characteristics
of
this
beer
from
about
the
middle
onward
there
is
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
that
tickles
the
tongue
yet
relinquishes
its
grip
after
the
beer
disappears
down
my
throat
this
is
another
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
by
goose
island
an
almost
perfectly
fizzy
mouthfeel
helps
this
beer
go
down
smooth
hex
nut
brown
ale
from

island
is
a
good

from
the
windy
city
one
that
i
will
visit
again
i
am
sure
overall
simple
but
effective
also
available
in
bottles
but
if
you
are
in
chicago
and
are
able
to
visit
either
brewpub
do
it
not
only
is
the
beer
and
food
amazing
but
the
servers
are
always
more
than
happy
to
get
into
the
details
of
the
process
involved
in
this
or
any
of
their
great
beers
when
drinking
this
beer
at
either
of
their
locations
its
best
served
in
a
12oz
pint
glass
its
the
best
to
experience
the
aroma
that
hits
your
nose
perfectly
before
letting
the
beer
hit
the
back
of
your
tongue
just
another
winner
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
overall
not
a
bad
brown
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
certainly
wouldnt
say
no
to
having
another
one
a
pleasantly
solid
brown
ale
id
like
to
find
more
of
this
lovelly
brown
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
very
drinkable
and
it
only
cost
me
3
99
a
sixer
i
would
definately
have
another
if
i
had
one
thanks
to
oldcrustacean
for
the
bottle
appearance
tawny
ruby
brown
hue
with
a
creamy
toffee
tan
head
leaves
retains
well
as
it
slowly
dwindles
leaves
behind
thick
patches
of
scattered
lacing
not
bad
aroma
a
nutty
chocolate
toned
edge
in
the
forefront
with
creamy
milky
sweetness
in
the
finish
with
roasted
edges
i
feel
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
an
english
style
nut
brown
ale
taste
smooth
flowing
wave
of
darker
roasted
malt
sweetness
tailed
by
a
touch
of
bitterness
characteristics
that
shine
is
the
toasted
nut
with
caramel
edges
very
nice
chocolate
creaminess
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
medium
body
very
silky
texture
light
carbonation
allows
this
very
quaffable
drinkability
nice
brew
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
and
enjoying
this
side
by
side
with
sammy
smiths
version
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
smells
malty
nutty
and
slightly
of
chocolate
taste
are
remeniscent
of
chocolate
nuts
and
caramel
very
malty
this
is
almost
a
desert
beer
fairly
easy
drinking
and
in
my
eyes
would
be
a
great
session
beer
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
good
job
gi
a
damn
good
nut
brown
ale
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
and
an
offwhite
tan
head
of
foam
that
lasts
for
the
long
haul
the
aromas
are
of
sweet
caramel
milk
chocolate
light
coffee
and
some
general
nut
flavors
the
taste
is
nutty
up
front
with
some
coffee
flavors
in
the
middle
and
some
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
for
a
nut
brown
but
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
reminds
me
of
sam
smiths
nut
brown
a
bit
and
that
is
definately
a
good
thing
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
sweet
english
style
nut
brown
ale
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
but
was
suprised
its
not
a
complex
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
to
be
very
refreshing
beer
that
is
perfect
to
drink
regularly
final
opinion
its
like
a
modified
version
of
newcastle
brown
ale
a
little
more
complexity
in
it
very
pleased
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
the
touch
of
smoked
malt
really
adds
character
my
type
of
brown
ale
brown
but
not
pansyass
like
newcastle
a
very
good
chicago
beer
with
wide
availability
this
is
one
malty
beast
im
not
a
huge
fun
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
makes
the
cut
in
my
book
pours
a
nice
lucid
brown
with
a
creamy
frothing
head
smell
is
very
malty
and
full
of
caramel
and
the
taste
matches
the
nose
well
very
malty
with
just
a
slightly
sweet
finish
which
is
good
because
i
still
have
yet
to
gain
an
appreciation
for
super
sweet
beers
drinkability
is
decent
as
well
good
beer
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
yet
leaves
a
partial
layer
on
top
smells
faintly
of
carmel
and
burnt
notes
not
much
of
a
hops
presence
taste
is
very
onenote
not
much
of
a
flavor
transition
or
it
is
just
that
well
balanced
roasted
malt
flavaors
again
not
much
of
a
hops
aftertaste
an
ok
beer
if
not
slightly
above
average
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
rubybrown
color
it
is
also
clear
there
is
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
linger
very
long
aroma
is
nutty
with
some
roastiness
and
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
is
somewhat
nutty
and
sweet
with
some
chocolate
roastiness
in
there
a
hair
watery
a
good
compliment
to
the
honkers
ale
ng
goose
island
hex
nut
brown
ale
tastes
like
i
hoped
it
would
i
prefer
porters
and
stouts
but
this
one
hits
all
of
its
style
marks
right
on
the
nose
this
is
a
quality
brew
that
ill
be
sure
to
look
for
again
a
nice
beer
definately
drinkable
id
recommend
it
and
love
to
try
it
on
tap
it
tastes
good
theres
brown
nuts
from
start
to
finish
with
very
wellblended
hop
content
recommended
any
complaints
ive
had
should
be
considered
minor
overall
a
pretty
great
beer
flavor
and
presentation
are
top
notch
an
excellent
brown
ale
in
all
respects
another
fine
brew
by
the
folks
at
goose
island
clear
brownmahogany
hue
with
a
graceful
ruby
highlights
the
beige
head
reached
a
hearty
finger
before
it
faded
slowly
to
half
that
size
then
it
depressed
to
a
loose
cap
laces
in
a
spotty
fashion
as
the
beer
was
consumed
the
potency
of
the
nose
is
very
modest
a
little
too
much
so
in
my
opinion
hard
whiffs
invokes
toasty
malts
and
toasty
caramel
notes
and
grain
hints
of
chocolate
the
aromas
are
indicative
of
a
brown
ale
yet
i
am
not
pressed
to
drink
it
the
palate
doesnt
have
much
going
on
this
is
said
as
a
fan
of
both
brown
ales
and
goose
island
frankly
hex
nut
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
maltiness
is
small
there
isnt
a
richness
in
the
taste
some
disjointed
sweetness
the
toastiness
is
faint
and
there
is
little
in
the
way
of
caramel
influences
traces
of
nuts
conclude
this
portion
of
the
beverage
the
hops
are
modest
appropriately
so
but
the
flavor
they
impart
are
ordinary
pleasantly
dry
throughout
this
is
easy
drinking
but
i
can
do
better
when
i
have
the
urge
to
drink
a
brown
ale
like
third
stone
for
instance
medium
in
body
low
modest
carbonation
maybe
a
little
too
much
so
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
slick
and
it
is
lacking
in
substance
the
aftertaste
is
lightly
nutty
and
sweet
yes
it
is
drinkable
but
is
it
flavorful
no
so
much
ill
drink
my
other
sample
but
ill
skip
it
in
the
future
purchased
in
sioux
falls
sd
goose
islands
hex
nut
brown
ale
tasted
like
a
classic
brown
ale
actually
it
tasted
like
our
home
brew
but
a
tad
milder
it
was
fairly
balanced
it
wasnt
overwhelmingly
hoppy
malty
or
sweet
it
was
what
a
brown
ale
should
taste
like
it
was
clear
maybe
a
bit
light
in
color
i
liked
it
its
low
abv
makes
it
an
easy
drink
heres
a
decent
brown
ale
from
goose
island
good
dark
caramelred
color
no
head
to
speak
of
no
lacing
nice
refreshing
taste
not
overbearing
at
all
much
of
what
youd
expect
from
a
brown
ale
its
like
newcastle
but
not
as
spicy
id
give
it
a
shot
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
you
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
this
one
poured
a
watery
copper
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
the
smell
was
a
nice
combination
of
nuts
caramel
and
toastiness
but
the
flavor
was
weak
it
tasted
watered
down
and
too
shallow
in
complexity
for
my
liking
water
was
the
main
flavor
here
followed
by
slight
malt
which
included
caramel
and
other
weak
flavors
this
does
go
down
easy
but
i
feel
they
made
this
to
suffice
the
public
when
they
could
have
stepped
it
up
a
notch
if
they
wanted
to
thats
fine
but
i
just
feel
it
had
to
potential
of
being
better
another
solid
player
in
the
goose
stable
finished
well
and
enjoyed
several
wow
what
a
nice
beer
to
be
finding
at
your
local
jewel
pours
a
nice
head
thats
just
a
little
offwhite
complex
chocolate
with
other
flavors
your
dads
pipe
smoke
nuttiness
is
implied
more
than
overt
take
this
one
home
with
you
and
itll
respect
you
in
the
morning
im
not
really
a
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
seemed
better
than
a
lot
of
others
that
ive
had
this
is
the
best
american
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
the
reason
i
think
it
is
so
good
is
that
it
is
very
similar
to
an
altbier
nice
tannish
head
on
a
dark
brownish
black
body
nutty
aromas
mix
in
with
flowery
hop
aromas
sweet
malt
is
nutty
in
flavor
and
slick
in
mouthfeel
and
the
hops
are
bitter
enough
to
balance
and
give
it
a
quick
dry
ending
this
is
more
of
an
altbier
than
their
sticke
altbier
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
without
changing
to
another
style
i
like
this
and
will
buy
more
of
this
this
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
borders
on
porterish
beats
the
heck
out
of
newcastle
just
like
the
label
says
this
one
is
brown
and
really
rather
nutty
good
patchwork
of
retained
lace
throughout
the
beer
is
alll
about
nuttiness
as
is
picked
up
immediately
on
the
nose
in
the
mouth
a
pronounced
sweet
oily
and
even
a
tad
savory
roasted
peanut
flavor
chimes
in
the
sensation
is
like
that
of
eating
a
resess
peanut
butter
cupsweet
then
chocolatey
then
salty
then
roasted
aftertaste
sensations
another
session
styled
offering
from
goose
and
a
decent
nut
to
bust
for
cool
weather
season
here
in
the
city
deep
brown
and
very
clear
a
slight
malty
aroma
is
basked
in
the
glow
of
bittersweet
chocolate

but
a
bit
thin
and
lacking
in
depth
bready
cookielike
malt
flavor
and
feel
a
roasted
presence
on
the
tongue
becomes
the
outstanding
feature
through
the
carmelized
and
burnt
sugar
finish
minus
its
roasty
chocolatey
character
this
brew
is
a
bit
normal
as
it
is
its
a
highly
drinkable
ale
with
a
little
bit
of
unique
character
bottlepoured
a
very
small

notes

with

with
you
in

for
a

i
would
have
this
one
again
goose
island
brews
represent
some
of
the
best
values
in
microbrews
today
they
are
rarely
exceptional
but
pretty
solid
overall
and
not
expensive
this
brew
pours
a
dark
tawny
brown
with
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
doesnt
leap
out
at
you
but
theres
some
definite
maltiness
and
faint
roasted
grain
the
taste
is
malt
dominated
with
toffee
a
bit
of
cafe
latte
and
a
finish
of
roasted
grainbarley
flavor
a
good
easydrinking
foodfriendly
brew
although
it
seems
a
bit
thin
and
watery
pours
a
dark
brown
with
copper
highlights
topped
by
a
tan
head
that
is
relatively
thick
and
fades
to
a
malty
film
of
foam
nice
caramel
and
a
slightly
nutty
aroma
perhaps
a
hint
of
choclate
along
with
the
light
hoppiness
the
taste
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
very
nice
nutty
finish
the
light
sweetness
is
balanced
well
by
the
bitter
hops
on
the
finish
chocolate
covered
caramel
flavors
intertwine
with
the
nut
and
slightly
roasted
malt
flavors
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
slightly
complex
beer
which
makes
it
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
enough
carbonation
to
lighten
the
presence
on
the
palate
drinakbility
is
very
good
as
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
finishes
almost
neutral
with
just
a
slight
lingering
hops
and
nut
aftertaste
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
better
browns
available
none
better
come
to
mind
at
the
moment
maybe
averys
ellies
brown
for
6
a
sixer
this
will
be
hard
to
beat
i
will
buy
a
bit
more
on
my
next
trip
towards
the
heartland
the
epitome
of
a
4
0
beer
in
every
category
it
is
above
average
just
not
much
above
average
the
appearance
is
dark
amber
with
a
malty
nutty
aroma
the
flavor
is
typical
of
a
brown
ale
light
nutty
and
better
when
not
too
cold
the
only
hoppy
flavors
come
out
when
this
is
just
colder
than
room
temp
i
recommend
decanting
and
leaving
for
at
least
a
half
hour
then
the
flavor
is
nutty
and
warming
to
the
throat
very
enjoyable
with
good
drinkability
for
the
money
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
beat
hex
nut
brown
ale
is
dark
reddish
brown
in
appearance
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
moderately
sweet
and
earthy
in
flavor
at
first
with
a
slightly
astringent
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
then
somewhat
bitter
finish
hoppy
aroma
and
delicious
flavor
but
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
nut
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
hex
nut
brown
ale
is
more
like
a
stout
in
many
ways
its
far
roastier
and
hoppier
than
say
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
to
me
hex
nut
brown
ale
seems
a
little
unusual
for
the
style
but
its
still
very
good
i
hope
to
try
more
offerings
from
goose
island
soon
yummy
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
though
i
like
brown
ales
to
be
nuttier
and
with
the
nut
in
the
title
i
thought
i
had
that
coming
anyway
still
a
very
good
beer
dark
dark
brown
appearance
and
roasty
smell
goes
down
very
smooth
i
could
drink
it
all
night
and
im
pretty
sure
i
did
i
definately
recomend
but
not
my
fav
brown
ale
a
really
deep
dark
mahogany
brew
that
is
just
great
in
initial
appearance
nice
tan
head
that
fades
far
too
quickly
and
leaves
only
faint
traces
of
lace
strong
nose
has
delicate
malt
notes
and
perhaps
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
body
is
medium
to
light
and
a
bit
watery
flavors
come
across
as
a
sweet
start
with
a
mildly
bitter
ending
in
the
front
that
lingers
for
an
instant
then
disappears
leaving
behind
a
very
dry
finish
very
drinkable
ale
for
sure
a
good
beer
if
youre
into
coffee
style
beers
this
ones
for
you
comes
out
with
about
an
inch
of
a
nice
light
brown
head
smelling
like
a
stroll
through
colombia
the
part

herbasiding
all
the
time

city
with
this
stuff
excellent
coffee
tone
with
a
strong

and
caramel
roastyness
the
smell
of
this
stuff
was
sooo
gooood
tastes
just
as
wonderful
as
it
smells
echoing
all
the
aromas
with
superb
balance
of
sweet
caramel

some
chestnut

thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
bottle
overall
a
very
nice
brown
ale
for
the
person
i
e
me
who
really
doesnt
like
brown
ales
that
much
much
sweeter
and
richer
than
most
brown
ales
but
balanced
not
cloyingly
sweet
would
like
to
see
a
wee
bit
more
hop
flavor
come
through
in
the
finish
i
dont
sample
many
nut
brown
ales
throughout
the
year
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
of
the
american
variety
poured
a
very
rich
darkish
brown
darker
than
i
had
anticipated
smelled
of
rich
malt
with
some
toastiness
the
finest
and
bare
minimum
of
lacing
surrendering
everywhere
but
the
very
edges
of

has
the
nutty

also
an

and
full
of

great

like
this
really
show
up
the
naked
emperors
of
the
big
beer
world
like
the
dismal
thin
newcastle
overall
not
bad
i
have
had
it
before
and
think
i
enjoyed
it
more
that
time
however
appearance
was
very
dark
brown
with
a
little
amber
coloring
the
head
was
dissappointing
lasting
for
only
a
minute
or
two
the
aroma
was
very
strong
with
caramel
malts
and
maybe
some
chocolate
very
little
nut
taste
for
a
nut
brown
ale
but
still
very
good
very
little
hops
to
speak
of
one
of
the
best
nut
brown
ales
ive
tried
especially
for
the
price
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
goose
island
products
hex
nut
brown
from
goose
island
in
chicago
a
very
brown
beer
with
not
much
of
a
head
i
do
recall
that
at
one
time
i
was
not
much
of
a
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
does
appear
that
it
has
grown
on
me
not
much
head
but
the
taste
is
fairly
decent
very
malty
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
all
in
all
a
nice
brew
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
has
a
light
brown
head
with
good
lacework
has
a
toasted
malt
aroma
as
well
as
a
nutty
aroma
the
flavors
are
of
sweet
toastroast
malt
chocolate
and
nutty
flavors
weave
their
way
through
this
brew
the
hop
bitterness
is
way
in
the
background
on
this
one
the
carbonation
is
at
a
low
level
with
this
lightmedium
bodied
beer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
with
various
nutty
and
toasty
malt
flavors
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again

an

consisted
of

taste
is
of

and
a

the
finish
kept
reminding
me
of
the
taste
of
a
fullbodied
cigar
very
complex
and
satisfying
brown
ale
deep
mahogany
with
a
thin
tan

that
settles
quickly

aroma

nutty
at
all
a
lot
of
roasted
chocolate
flavor
light
to
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
a
very
solid
beer
but
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
at
you
a
good
session
ale
after
a
few
tastings
of
this
beer
over
time
i
feel
it
is
best
after
it
has
aged
for
a
bit
after
all
it
is
bottleconditioned
so
can
afford
to
be
a
workmanlike
brew
solid
all
around
but
not
memorable
in
any
special
way
more
enjoyable
than
newcastles
version
but
a
little
more
pricey
as
well
i
tasted
a
hint
of
nutmeg
andor
brown
sugar
i
dont
know
my
spices
that
well
and
this
ale
managed
to
be
both
smooth
and
robust
at
the
same
time
good
stuff
this
is
one
of
those
all
body
beers
but
a
pretty
decent
stab
at
an
english
brown
ale
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
depth
of
flavour
pours
dark
amber
with
small
fleeting
head
aromas
are
present
though
hard
to
describe
upon
tasting
it
i
would
describe
the
smell
as
i
would
the
tastesweet
rather
smooth
yet
with
a
hint
of
maltiness
and
darkness
toward
the
end
smooth
and
drinkablea
fine
midline
brew
this
beer
poured
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
and
formed
a
light
tan
head
that
subsided
quickly
and
left
some
lace
it
had
an
aroma
of
hops
caramel
and
malt
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
caramel
the
finish
was
medium
slightly
creamy
with
a
defininate
caramel
aftertaste
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
others
but
still
a
good
beer
a
good
drinking
brown
ale
more
of
an
english
style
sweet
brown
ale
if
you
are
into
malty
brown
ales
this
one
will
do
you
right
good
pairing
with
chocolate
and
or
caramel
sweets
hex
nut
is
a
good
name
with
hints
of
roasted
nuts
chocolate
and
almost
coffee
like
is
it
a
porter
or
almost
stoutlike
i
was
surprised
by
this
dark
rubybrown
brew
with
a
tan
shortlived
head
and
lace
i
found
it
a
cool
brew
with
a
cool
name
that
fits
i
had
this
beer
while
traveling
it
was
served
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
disappeared
slightly
malty
roasted
grain
aroma
very
mild
subtle
taste
seemed
to
be
well
made
with
no
flaws
but
not
very
interesting
seems
more
like
a
porter
nice
and
mealy
roasted
nuts
and
chocolate
dark
color
with
a
hint
of
auburn

light

my
favorite
available
nut
brown
clear
dark
ruby
brown
in
color
light
nutty
and
bready
malt
in
aroma
just
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
a
mellow
but
earthy
willamette
hop
nose
is
there
as
well
lightly
bodied
w
an
agreeable
mouthfeel
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
slight
chocolate
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
are
most
noticeable
since
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
is
quite
mild
very
clean
overall
with
nothing
outstanding
or
offensive
in
taste
finishes
with
slight
caramel
sweetness
hex
nut
is
innocuous
drinkable
but
perhaps
a
bit
bland
it
could
easily
pass
for
a
mild
impressive
very
dark
brown
color
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
faint
notes
of
caramel
chocolate
molasses
prunes
and
other
dark
fruit
tease
the
nose
along
with
some
hops
moderate
body
the
taste
backs
up
what
the
nose
has
already
detected
delicious
crisp
in
the
finish
with
some
hops
just
to
balance
also
seemed
like
a
porter
to
mevery
chocolaty
and
malty
like
one
somewhat
nutty
undertonescant
drink
to
many
somewhat
heavybut
well
crafted
would
like
to
try
on

one
of
my
favorite
browns
very
nutty
taste
that
makes
up
for
the
styles
tendency
to
blandness
nice
persistent
character
even
evolves
in
nutiness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
fresh
smell
and
nice
clean

especially
for
a
bottle
conditioned
brew
predominantly
malt
aroma
with
just
a
shot
of
fruit
scent
to
it
rather
small
head
that
stayed
very
thin
very
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
and
seemed
clear
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
with
some
sweetness
plus
fruitiness
qualities
in
middle
and
finish
some
bitterness
to
balance
and
a
little
to
the
finish
medium
fullness
with
more
carbonation
than
i
would
have
expected
another
good
beer
from
a
respectable
brewery
very
mild
with
restrained
hops
bittering
the
somewhat
nutty
malt
struck
me
as
being
more
like
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
very
pleasant
smells
like
baked
beans
in
a
glass
on
tap
2nd
favorite
brew
from
this
establishment
pours
brown
with
a
tan
clingy
head
all
malt
and
caramel
in
the
nose
flavors
are
the
same
sweet
smooth
malty
goodness
with
a
characteristic
common
to
most
of
their
brews
that
others
have
noted
maple
really
works
for
me
finish
leaves
me
wanting
more
this
is
what
i
pick
for
a
growler
to
go
had
in
st
j
vt
carbonation
distracts
from
the
malts
but
room
temperature
brings
out
some
nice
dark
flavors
the
sweet
finish
is
also
compromised
by
the
carbonation
still
tasty
and
could
grow
on
a
person
overly
carbonated
with
a
very
dry
finish
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
tend
to
prefer
but
its
very
drinkable
definitely
a
good
barbecue
beer
this
is
a
nice
easy
clean
drinkable
brown
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
interesting
flavor
the
lower
alcohol
makes
this
a
very
nice
session
beer
overall
i
have
enjoyed
this
a
lot
over
the
years
and
i
had
forgot
how
could
it
tasted
ill
have
it
more
often
nice
work
on
this
beer
this
is
my
favorite
brown
ale
i
hope
i
can
get
up
to
lincoln
for
the
beer
fest
at
the
end
of
june
and
pick
up
some
more
pigs
ear
so
if
you
go
leave
a
few
behind
please

overall
ok
beer
not
my
first
pick
but
credit
is
due
for
thosr
that
might
be
more
into
the
browns
than
me
this
is
just
a
solid
brown
ale
its
obviously
no
where
near
rouges
hazelnut
bron
nectar
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
brew
supper
cheap
in
the
new
england
area
id
recommend
it
anyone
that
lives
in
new
england
for
sure
nothing
about
the
pigs
ear
brown
is
real
offputting
my
pour
got
me
a
finger
of
fizzy
lightbrown
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
rubygarnet
highlights
nose
was
quite
malty
reminiscent
of
something
that
eluded
me
but
perhaps
it
will
come
did
i
sense
a
slight
buttery
quality
i
usually
have
a
blind
spot
when
it
comes
to
diacetyl
so
i
may
be
mistaken
plus
i
really
do
not
mind
such
a
flavor
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
much
more
chocolaty
than
i
had
experienced
on
the
nose
it
had
a
powdery
taste
like
hersheys
cocoa
powder
right
out
of
the
tin
and
into
the
mouth
do
they
even
make
that
any
more
i
knew
precisely
where
it
was
stored
in
my
maternal
grandmothers
house
and
used
to
love
it
straight
as
a
child
i
sprinkled
it
on
peanut
butter
to
make
a
phenomenal
sandwich
thats
what
the
nose
reminded
me
of
ovaltine
great
gar
but
this
beer
really
takes
me
back
i
saw
where
newcastle
brown
is
the
standard
bearer
for
the
style
but
this
is
drier
than
that
the
finish
was
semisweet
with
the
yeast
having
converted
most
of
the
fermentable
sugar
to
alcohol
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
little
piggy
this
may
be
my
favorite
brown
ale
poured
a
2
beige
head
with
long
life
the
body
is
a
deep
burnt
umber
brown
and
held
to
the
light
its
a
clear
lively
maroon
nice
light
smell
of
roasted
malt
taste
matches
the
smell
richer
than
i
expected
buttery
and
with
some
bitter
hops
coming
through
finish
us
a
little
sweet
pours
a
dark
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
before
leaving
some
spotty
lace
on
the
way
down
smells
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
tart
fruit
earth
roast
and
butter
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
and
butterscotch
with
an
earthy
hop
bite
that
provides
some
balance
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
bubbly
mouthfeel
so
far
this
is
the
only
brew
ive
had
where
i
feel
the
diacytyl
actually
adds
something
to
the
beer
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
woodstock
but
its
still
just
an
average
beer
this
is
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
i
would
get
this
again
for
sure
overall
its
a
nice
beer
all
around
style
nice
malts
decent
hops
with
a
nice
bitter
kick
very
drinkable
perfect
beer
for
almost
any
weather
and
always
a
good
beer
to
grab
a
pint
of
at
a
bar
o
overall
not
bad
would
drink
again
but
there
are
better
brown
ales
out
there
oda
nice
little
brown
ale
will
not
wow
you
but
i
drank
my
glass
very
quickly
i
love
the
nutty
aspect
of
this
brew
a
decent
sip
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
february
28
2012
the
pour
is
mahogany
brown
with
a
conspicuous
amount
of
foamy
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
it
has
a
nutty
malted
quality
as
well
as
sweet
the
body
is
smooth
the
taste
is
higher
on
the
bitterness
than
in
the
aroma
with
a
sharp
lingering
hop
note
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
drink
a
lot
and
i
am
surprised
that
it
took
so
long
for
me
to
review
it
o
overall
this
beer
makes
a
great
impression
it
is
flavorful
and
drinkable
while
being
very
low
in
alcohol
content
allowing
to
you
have
pint
after
pint
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
4
3
category
i
have
had
i
bet
this
would
go
great
with
a
nice
burger
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
dark
chestnut
colored
body
thin
white
head
with
a
look
of
creaminess
in
composition
somewhat
soapy
hop
aroma
which
caught
my
attention
in
a
bad
way
taste
was
on
the
good
side
though
very
malty
bready
and
hearty
very
tiny
bit
of
english
hops
in
the
background
quite
a
smooth
mouthfeel
which
was
the
standout
character
of
this
beer
low
abv
made
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
pigs
ear
is
a
nononsense
brown
ale
that
gives
you
what
you
want
from
a
brown
ale
flavor
and
drinkability
d
a
sweeter
and
darker
brown
nice
fairly
character
malt
base
with
plentiful
accent
notes
makes
for
a
good
wellrounded
and
flavorful
brown
good
drinking
especially
on
a
fall
day
almost
rich
enough
to
have
a
holiday
feel
but
with
an
easy
abv
standard
brown
ale
appeasing
tasty
and
good
looking
sits
well
after
a
good
meal
goes
well
with
a
steak
or
some
other
kind
of
grilled
meat
originally
bought
a
case
from
the
woodstock
inn
brewery
and
went
through
it
in
a
day
with
the
roommates
we
enjoyed
it
so
much
its
a
very
neutral
tasting
beer
that
can
be
drunk
at
anytime
the
makers
succeeded
in
making
a
great
brown
a
good
addition
to
anyones
collection
or
to
drink
list
for
the
week
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
unique
the
nutty
flavor
and
feeling
lasts
forever
and
that
is
definitely
the
highlight
of
it
not
the
best
but
a
really
good
session
beer
o
very
good
brown
ale
that
i
highly
recommend
if
you
can
find
it
o
theres
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
in
this
beer
for
the
abv
i
really
wish
i
liked
this
beer
more
overall
a
good
brown
ale
that
has
good
balance

one

that
left
some
lacing
it
has
a
nice
aroma
caramel
malt
molasses
faint

and
a
hint
of

the
taste
is
good
nutty
dry
faint

nice

an
easy
drinker
overall
quite
refreshing
for
a
brown
ale
and
one
i
could
easily
have
again
some
other
time

i
wish
i
could
get
this
locally

would
defiantly
put
it
in
the
rotation

friend

is
in

had
alittle
too
much
sweetness
and
not
much
going
on
in
this
brown
ale
was
hoping
for
alittle
bit
more
all
in
all
a
solid
brown
ale
i
particularly
enjoy
the
vanilla
undertones
mentioned
above
md
good
on
the
palate
and
quite
drinkable
id
have
another
d
nothing
too
bad
but
nothing
too
exciting
could
certainly
have
a
few
more
but
with
better
beers
in
this
world
why
bother
db
solid
brown
ale
for
sure
full
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
maybe
just
a
tad
bit
too
nutty
for
me
but
i
like
it
this
is
an
average
brown
ale
enjoyable
but
not
one
that
stands
out
i
poured
from
the
straight
from
the
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
color
was
medium
brown
with
small
white
laced
head
it
did
not
have
the
greatest
head
retention
but
not
the
worst
by
any
means
the
aroma
was
a
faint
maplebread
with
very
little
hop
character
the
taste
was
decent
but
nothing
super
there
is
a
bit
of
a
nutty
breadlike
taste
that
lingers
on
the
way
down
this
beer
has
high
drinkability
because
it
is
very
smooth
if
you
like
nut
brown
ales
then
it
is
worth
a
try
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
best
part
full
bodied
rich
and
smooth
carbonation
level
is
well
done
very
drinkable
depends
on
how
you
want
to
drink
it
though
this
beer
is
worth
a
couple
of
chances
but
i
like
it
on
tap
better
so
far
as
for
the
bottle
id
save
it
for
fall
or
winter
drinkability
can
pound
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
its
a
full
bodied
beer
that
is
not
too
filling
had
a
few
of
these
samples
at
the
acbf
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
was
very
excited
to
have
had
a
beer
that
i
couldnt
get
down
here
while
i
was
up
there
think
syrupy
body
with
a
slight
nutty
hint
no
dry
effects
on
pallet
color
was
a
nice
medium
brown
no
a
lot
of
head
though
very
pleasant
and
had
me
wanting
a
second
helping
anxious
to
try
more
from
the
folks
at
woodstock
inn
im
kind
od
a
bock
guy
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
worth
a
try

its
better

is

notes

at
first
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
was
ready
for
a
better
tasting
cold
beer
sitting
back
in
the
room
chappycubsfanmar
13
with
a
really
nice
small
bubbled
mouthfeel
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
with
a
lighter
dark
brown
pour
with
thin
tan
head
color
is
excellent
smell
is
mild
malt
and
slightly
nutty
taste
is
also
a
bit
underwhelming
with
a
sweetness
that
quickly
fades
to
a
clean
nut
finish
only
real
nit
is
it
seems
a
bit
overcarbonated
otherwise
very
drinkable
in
quantity
its
crisp
all
the
way
and
moderately
smooth
in
a
dry
medium
body
it
thins
a
little
into
the
finish
o
an
easydrinking
english
brown
with
a
nice
signature
nuttiness
good
for
a
small
session
what
an
extremely
accurate
name
its
nutty
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
sweet
almost
like
a
hint
of
honey
making
it
a
perfect
complement
for
some
fiery
wings
or
even
some
of
the
sweeter
flavors
of
wings
available
at
some
pubs
carbonation
is
a
bit
higher
than
average
but
its
pretty
well
balanced
with
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
before
i
even
finished
my
first
bottle
i
was
thinking
about
picking
up
another
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
purchase
again
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
amber
color
and
it
smelled
really
good
i
had
high
hopes
for
the
beer
the
beer
had
a
nice
bready
smell
however
the
taste
was
just
not
there
watery
weak
coffee
hit
lacing
was
good
but
thats
about
all
the
good
i
can
give
it
no
nut
did
i
get
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
taste
ok
with
nothing
that
really
stands
out
to
make
me
want
to
buy
it
again
my
favorite
out
of
the
12
pack
sampler
that
i
purchased
i
always
saw
peak
organic
on
the
shelf
but
was
never
inclined
to
throw
it
in
the
shopping
cart
with
my
budget
a
little
tighter
now
than
years
past
i
tend
to
search
out
reasonably
priced
twelve
packs
instead
of
pricey
six
packs
peak
organic
is
a
great
tasting
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
although
i
just
snagged
the
magic
hat
summer
scene
sampler
for
a
little
variety
another
offering
from
this
brewer
that
implies
lazy
shortcuts
and
a
dumbed
down
target
audience
the
nuttiness
of
the
title
is
just
too
understated
and
the
whole
affair
is
altogether
restrained
too
afraid
of
putting
it
all
out
there
for
the
world
to
see
becoming
nothing
more
than
a
mote
in
the
proverbial
dust
in
the
wind
just
weak
pass
on
this
one
o
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
years
but
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
remember
its
oddly
hoppy
and
bitter
with
what
tastes
like
a
strong
noble
hop
presence
this
hop
presence
is
at
odds
with
the
buttery
house
ringwood
taste
but
the
biggest
problem
is
that
its
desperately
in
need
of
a
beefedup
malt
bill
there
just
isnt
enough
backbone
to
hold
everything
together
overall
this
a
tasty
one
and
probably
my
favorite
in
the
mix
pack
i
got
could
use
some
more
body
but
it
is
one
you
can
sip
on
all
afternoon
this
is
a
poor
example
of
nut
brown
ale
it
is
watery
flat
and
has
no
body
it
is
very
similar
to
trout
river
scottish
ale
which
is
the
worst
dish
water
not
worthy
of
being
called
a
beer
known
to
man
at
10
00
six
pack
i
can
think
of
a
whole
bunch
of
better
ways
to
use
10
bucks
the
take
away
here
is
that
there
is
a
lot
of
room
to
start
a
micro
brewery
because
this
sucks
this
is
lousy
and
there
are
better
ways
to
make
a
quality
beer
o
i
think
the
only
drawback
to
this
beer
is
that
theres
nothing
overly
exciting
or
impressive
about
it
that
being
said
its
a
decent
session
ale
and
one
of
the
better
organic
offerings
ive
had
this
beer
poured
a
relatively
light
brown
shade
a
bit
translucent
its
head
was
there
and
then
it
was
gone
it
did
not
over
power
you
with
its
scent
but
there
were
some
nutty
burnt
brown
sugar
notes
just
not
many
taste
was
solid
again
nothing
overwhelming
here
but
some
coffee
and
some
dry
bitter
sweetness
can
be
detected
mouthfeel
was
on
the
dry
side
it
did
not
leave
any
lingering
aftertaste
either
overall
this
is
a
solid
english
brown
and
can
be
easily
drunk
overall
actually
a
pretty
tasty
and
successful
nut
brown
ale
id
have
this
again
overall
perhaps
a
little
too
bitter
to
be
really
sessionable
but
still
pretty
tasty
i
wont
rush
out
to
get
more
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
its
a
bit
dry
which
effects
the
flavor
and
the
drinkability
for
those
getting
into
the
style
or
are
new
to
craft
beer
this
would
be
a
good
offering
another
beer
from
peak
that
does
nothing
in
particular
special
other
than
having
been
competently
made
and
organic
o
a
decent
beer
not
great
it
has
some
good
flavors
that
just
come
through
as
being
rather
muted
i
wish
the
maltiness
was
more
potent
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
but
not
very
exciting
peak
organic
nut
brown
ale
is
a
clear
sparkling
copper
ale
with
a
lumpy
beige
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
malt
and
caramel
with
a
sharp
grassy
note
its
medium
bodied
and
foamy
with
a
very
dry
slightly
abrasive
finish
there
really
isnt
much
flavor
there
is
a
little
malt
thats
almost
sweet
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
nutty
and
chocolatey
its
not
a
very
exciting
beer
but
not
unpleasant
at
all
o
the
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
goes
down
very
easily
i
would
have
no
problem
having
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
would
only
drink
another
if
all
other
choices
were
bud
or
something
of
the
same
ilk
a
dark
brown
color
with
slightly
yellowed
edges
with
a
decent
egg
shell
colored
head
and
speckled
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
malty
nutty
vanilla
and
thick
brown
bread
much
stronger
than
expected
and
pretty
good
the
taste
offers
thin
charcoal
molasses
with
raisin
brown
bread
and
pear
i
pick
up
some
sour
fruit
as
well
its
on
the
acqueous
side
light
to
medium
bodied
with
very
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
somewhat
gutsy
brown
ale
while
being
plenty
drinkable
ive
grown
a
bit
weary
of
this
style
as
a
general
rule
but
this
wasnt
bad
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
dark
auburnbrown
coloring
vibrant
and
crisp
with
no
head
aromas
are
rich
and
bready
with
strong
caramel
nut
and
molasses
characteristics
very
inviting
nose
flavors
are
roasty
with
nut
and
toffee
profiles
and
a
hint
of
dark
roast
coffee
the
body
is
very
light
and
crisp
with
a
hazelnut
flavor
creeping
in
good
clean
crisp
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
i
cannot
stress
enough
how
much
i
love
peak
organic
beer
expect
to
see
many
more
of
their
beers
on
active
beer
geek
for
they
are
worth
their
weight
in
gold
o
decent
for
the
style
but
i
actually
liked
this
enough
to
probably
have
it
again
i
like
this
one
its
a
solid
brown
ale
peak
organic
continues
to
win
me
over
overall
a
very
forgetful
nut
brown
ale
but
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
just
forgetable
really
disappointed
with
this
beer
had
it
on
tap
at
kinsale
in
boston
thought
the
appearance
was
pretty
watery
though
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
much
so
in
terms
of
taste
it
was
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
nut
brown
malty
caramel
notes
definite
nuttiness
little
bit
of
toffee
however
the
killer
for
me
was
the
aftertaste
i
just
couldnt
shake
a
horrible
lingering
of
cigarcigarette
smoke
in
the
aftertaste
had
my
gf
try
the
beer
and
she
didnt
notice
it
as
much
but
i
couldnt
get
past
it
every
sip
pretty
much
ruined
the
beer
for
me
id
probably
prefer
newcastle
to
this
medium
body
excellent
carbonation
semidry
finish
o
a
good
brown
ale
nice
middle
of
the
road
d
strange
brew
smells
and
looks
like
a
brown
the
first
shot
is
brown
and
then
everything
just
shuts
down
a
little
disappointing
brown
in
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
seriously
this
had
to
have
looked
better
then
damn
near
anything
else
i
have
run
across
recently
aroma
is
dark
fruits
lots
of
sweet
brown
sugary
notes
hints
of
clove
and
light
earthy
hops
all
mixing
together
nearly
perfectly
at
this
point
in
time
nice
smooth
even
carbonation
and
feel
here
now
as
well
really
well
placed
i
have
to
admit
rich
warm
flavor
here
nice
mix
of
pear
light
spice
hints
at
brown
sugar
and
a
nice
even
caramel
flavored
dry
finish
overall
very
refreshing
and
the
nutty
finish
made
me
crave
more
this
beer
has
a
better
aroma
that
newcastle
brown
ale
but
i
was
pretty
disappointed
in
the
head
oits
a
solid
but
unspectacular
beer
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
there
are
others
id
rather
have
d
a
perfectly
decent
brown
ale
i
have
no
objections
and
cant
really
come
up
with
any
suggestions
to
improve
the
beer
it
is
kind
of
a
hard
style
to
review
but
this
has
as
much
depth
as
any
other
brown
ale
that
i
have
had
with
multiple
shades
of
brown
malt
and
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
balanced
and
drinkable
grabbed
a
bottle
at
euromarket
along
with
all
my
weird
eastern
european
beers
there
was
a
big
nutty
cocoa
aroma
and
flavor
sort
of
a
sessionstrength
dessert
beer
i
like
it
theres
malty
caramel
in
the
background
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
that
carry
through
the
finish
the
body
is
a
little
light
and
oddly
acidic
but
its
nearly
full
enough
without
approaching
heavy
you
could
certainly
enjoy
a
few
bottles
after
dinner
o
very
good
beer
with
just
enough
complexity
not
to
distract
the
drinker
from
its
pleasures
great
for
drinking
on
a
warm
late
spring
day
nothing
bad
all
all
but
quite
mellow
and
lacking
in
any
robust
flavors
really
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
brown
ale
o
i
want
to
like
this
but
it
just
misses
the
mark
if
you
blindfolded
me
and
told
me
this
was
an
american
amber
craft
lager
i
wouldnt
doubt
you
at
all
db
one
of
the
lightest
brown
ales
i
can
think
of
the
flavor
feels
a
bit
diluted
or
something
appears
more
of
deep
amber
than
an
actual
brown
color
head
billows
with
chunk
cream
colored
lacing
left
clinging
to
the
sides
of
my
imperial
pint
after
each
sip
aroma
has
some
cereal
grain
sweetness
roasted
malts
are
evident
with
a
hint
of
toasted
nuts
hanging
around
no
real
hop
accents
just
a
hint
of
underlying
earthiness
coming
through
flavors
are
light
restrained
some
caramel
maltdarker
earthiness
with
cereal
grains
and
a
but
of
husk
character
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
levels
the
peak
organic
brews
as
a
whole
have
confused
me
twist
off
bottles
certified
organic
decent
beer
overall
just
nothing
awe
inspiring
thats
never
been
done
before
theres
no
point
in
drinking
this
except
if
you
really
want
organic
even
though
the
hops
probably
arent
actually
organic
verdict
im
not
incredibly
knowledgeable
about
brown
ales
yet
but
this
one
is
acceptable
on
several
levels
the
taste
is
lightly
roasted
with
flavor
the
mouthfeel
sticky
dry
the
appearance
was
also
pretty
good
this
beer
did
a
pretty
good
job
at
impressing
me
its
a
worthy
drink
especially
in
the
limited
range
of
the
organic
beer
department
b

d
i
enjoyed
this
brown
ale
the
sweet
smell
mild
could
have
several
in
a
row
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
brown
ales
i
had
hops
were
nice
and
flavor
was
natural
and
creamy
overall
a
great
brown
ale
that
is
mighty
tasty
d
a
decent
beer
overall
but
the
hop
flavor
is
a
tad
high
for
the
style
it
seems
as
though
there
was
an
unnecessary
hop
addition
around
the
middle
of
the
boil
that
gave
this
way
too
much
emphasis
on
the
hop
flavor
overall
not
bad
but
the
recipe
needs
tweaking
drinkability
great
brew
has
a
complex
evolving
taste
that
makes
the
nuttiness
of
the
beer
a
subtle
flavor
to
search
for
rather
than
one
that
smacks
you
in
the
mouth
i
would
buy
a
few
of
these
d
very
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
and
not
feeling
too
full
goes
down
very
smooth
no
real
aftertaste
o
very
nonoffensive
plus
side
of
the
thin
mouth
feel
is
that
it
isnt
a
meal
in
a
bottle
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
thought
it
a
great
representation
of
the
nut
brown
style
it
warms
the
body
from
the
first
sight
of
the
color
after
it
is
poured
to
the
last
drop
gliding
across
the
tongue
drinkability
a
nice
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
very
solid
tasty
and
highly
sessionable
d
inviting
for
repeats
overallignoring
the
politics
this
is
well
done
another
keeper
not
outstanding
but
holds
up
to
other
versions
of
the
style
i
find
the
flavor
similar
to
troegs
nut
brown
ale
a
nice
beer
to
be
similar
too
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
12
oz
bottle
this
beer
treads
a
very
fine
line
between
amber
and
brown
in
my
opinion
especially
when
held
up
to
the
light
when
you
do
so
it
has
nothing
to
hide
with
excellent
clarity
in
the
initial
pour
there
is
a
light
offwhite
creamy
colored
head
that
slowly
fades
throughout
the
session
small
amounts
of
lace
slowly
tread
and
trickle
back
to
the
liquid
after
each
sip
the
smell
is
good
like
most
in
this
style
its
well
malted
slight
hints
of
toffee
hops
make
themselves
known
but
dont
exactly
jump
out
at
you
some
slight
herbal
tea
aromas
as
well
tastes
better
than
it
smells
again
well
malted
possibly
some
chocolate
malts
here
i
think
there
are
certainly
some
blended
malts
here
both
roasted
and
smoked
possibly
peat
but
as
strong
as
it
tends
to
be
like
english
browns
the
malts
outweigh
the
hops
but
hops
are
present
and
provide
a
good
combination
of
all
the
flavors
burps
up
nice
too
the
mouthfeel
is
good
slightly
lighter
than
i
expected
but
still
good
i
find
some
of
this
style
to
be
a
little
buttery
at
times
but
this
one
is
mostly
clean
well
certainly
finishes
that
way
drinkablility
is
good
overall
this
is
an
easydrinking
brown
but
its
just
not
robust
enough
to
make
it
above
average
md
medium
body
appropriate
carbonation
dry
finish
fairly
drinkable
pretty
unremarkable
nothing
great
not
much
to
say
about
it
a
bit
of
a
letdown
compared
to
other
peak
brews
ive
had
d
i
liked
it
but
at
8
50
a
6
pack
or
34
00
a
case
it
will
remain
just
a
brew
that
i
tried
to
add
another
one
to
my
reviews
and
to
broaden
my
beer
horizons
one
of
the
lightest
nut
brown
ales
i
can
recall
but
still
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
its
not
the
most
exciting
beer
but
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
d
overall
it
doesnt
really
live
up
to
a
nut
brown
ale
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
it
just
shouldnt
bill
itself
as
something
it
is
not
certainly
passable
easy
to
drink
and
without
a
doubt
an
easy
session
beer
but
theres
no
wow
here
nothing
to
set
it
apart
from
other
brown
ales
besides
the
fact
that
its
organic
pair
this
one
with
a
nutty
canadian
cheddar
on
herbed
water
crackers
or
baste
a
free
range
chicken
and
root
vegetables
pours
a
pretty
clear
copperymahogany
with
an
average
light
beige
head
aroma
is
yeasty
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
flavor
is
strongly
yeasty
perhaps
too
yeasty
with
a
bitter
overtone
and
a
malty
undertone
ok
if
no
great
shakes
texture
is
fairly
smooth
a
little
tingly
maybe
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
leaves
a
slightly
tinny
but
not
unpleasant
aftertaste
4
across
the
board
good
beer
this
beer
is
typical
brown
with
with
a
dark
amber
color
it
starts
with
a
good
white
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
starts
with
a
sweet
maltyness
and
ends
with
a
slight
chocolaty
maltyness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
wanted
more
nuttyness
as
the
name
indicated
i
want
to
try
this
beer
on
draft
as
their
reviews
seem
to
be
much
better
d
a
nice
approachable
brown
ale
a
sessionable
easy
drinker
sometimes
its
nice
having
a
basic
option
like
this
brown
ales
are
a
somewhat
forgotten
and
neglected
bunch
but
this
is
worthwhile
d
because
of
the
flavor
i
only
got
a
couple
of
sips
into
this
one
before
it
went
down
the
drain
given
the
other
reviews
im
chalking
this
one
up
to
a
bad
batch
and
ill
pick
up
another
to
review
again

review
from
notes
taken
on
101109
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
smells
of
warm
buttered
toast
the
flavors
are
initially
bitter
a
woody
earthy
bitterness
that
gives
way
to
a
very
pleasant
sweet
finish
this
is
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
its
genre
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
overall
quite
mild
for
a
brown
ale
their
amber
ale
is
more
intense
than
this
but
the
brown
is
still
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
drinkability
not
a
bad
lil
brown
really
and
one
i
could
cheerfully
consume
a
lot
of
on
the
plus
side
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
probably
be
a
good
session
beer
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
good
beer
you
would
drink
in
college
but
when
you
go
back
to
try
it
again
it
isnt
anything
special
this
poured
a
brown
srm22
clear
with
a
persistent
light
tan
head
supported
by
a
moderate
carbonation
very
sweet
malty
aroma
with
little
hops
noted
malty
brown
sugartoffee
flavor
that
is
sweet
without
being
cloying
and
a
low
hop
bitterness
moderate
body
and
a
clean
finish
very
drinkable
d
a
pretty
mild
english
brown
that
would
be
sessionable
for
the
organic
fan
i
prefer
wolavers
to
this
but
its
not
all
that
bad
hopefully
a
better
taste
comes
from
the
bottle
id
like
to
give
it
another
shot
sometime
t
crisp
almost
watery
which
is
probably
a
sin
for
a
beer
but
its
a
decent
flavor
its
just
tastes
too
clean
for
a
beer
slight
smokeyness
to
it
malt
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
a
good
beer
if
you
like
the
style
ive
been
eager
to
try
an
organic
beer
but
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
i
was
pleased
but
not
blown
away
a
very
good
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
very
classic
recommended
d
a
decent
brown
but
not
a
standout
the
taste
is
not
bad
there
is
nuttiness
to
it
and
a
sort
of
burnt
sweet
aftertaste
that
turns
ashen
over
time
on
the
other
hand
it
also
seems
actually
chemically
imbalanced
it
has
a
sort
of
soapy
feeling
that
leaves
my
lips
and
throat
feeling
parched
and
scratchy
rather
than
simply
dry
i
found
this
increasingly
distracting
as
i
finished
my
glass
i
would
not
seek
out
another
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
drink
first
the
aroma
is
toasted
with
some
chocolate
nuts
malt
and
vinegar
the
appearance
is
medium
red
brown
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
and
not
to
my
liking
the
palate
is
smooth
but
the
finish
is
acidic
and
astringent
it
is
like
sucking
on
a
bar
of
soap
overall
its
not
even
average
redbrown
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
that
left
a
bit
of
lacing
caramel
malt
aroma
some
nuttiness
also
the
taste
was
not
as
strong
as
the
aroma
suggested
caramel
and
hazlenut
but
in
a
muted
way
a
little
bit
of
hops
i
would
say
mediumbodied
an
ok
beer
d
i
would
seek
out
another
brown
ale
as
there
are
many
better
exmaples
the
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
caramel
and
dark
malts
slight
nuttiness
to
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
of
a
solid
malt
base
with
a
nice
nutty
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
some
malty
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
great
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
the
beer
is
a
solid
feeling
without
being
filling
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
this
is
the
first
organic
beer
that
i
have
tried
and
am
impressed
thusfar
anyways
that
rant
aside
this
brew
came
off
as
a
decent
enough
brown
ale
the
coffee
aftertaste
that
comes
in
brown
ales
is
usually
what
turns
me
off
i
think
in
this
brew
the
coffee
taste
isnt
so
bad
sort
of
muted
by
a
decent
mouthfeel
i
would
drink
this
again
aside
from
that
i
dont
see
much
else
to
add
i
mean
everything
else
is
there
in
this
ale
really
standard
no
frills
no
special
features
d
a
decent
brew
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
drinkability
improves
as
it
warms
pours
a
nice
chestnut
color
with
almost
rubylike
highlights
decent
sized
foamy
tan
head
dissipates
slowly
leaves
a
few
patches
of
lacing
on
the
glass
big
caramel
nose
on
this
beer
some
faint
cocoa
powder
flavors
are
pretty
robust
chocolatey
brown
bread
faint
coffee
mediumbodied
with
some
busy
little
bubbles
this
is
tasty
easytodrink
and
a
nobrainer
at
the
dinner
table
good
stuff
d
great
start
with
looks
and
smell
but
once
i
really
got
to
know
this
beer
its
palatability
went
downhill
great
for
a
one
night
stand
but
not
a
longterm
relationship
a
nice
beer
one
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
overall
a
nutty
brown
ale
thats
a
bit
watery
for
the
style
the
color
seems
a
bit
golden
or
bronze
and
shimmering
to
be
a
nut
brown
smells
like
wonderbread
no
hops
sense
at
all
really
which
is
fine
with
a
light
malty
smell
that
strengthens
a
bit
on
the
tongue
mineral
taste
and
smell
as
wella
bit
off
not
bad
but
nothing
id
order
a
second
beer
ofthe
bottle
seems
a
little
stale
as
well
so
a
trying
a
fresh
draft
some
time
is
in
order
if
i
get
the
chance
some
day
overall
quite
tasty
for
an
organic
and
went
well
with
my
cheese
and
herb
flatbread
definitely
would
drink
again
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
it
isnt
the
most
complex
nut
brown
ale
out
there
but
a
solidlyexecuted
example
of
the
style
recommended
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
beer
i
bought
this
bottle
at
woodmans
in
oak
creek
wi
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
in
this
style
easy
drinkability
due
to
the
lack
of
cloying
flavors
and
relatively
low
abv
however
as
far
as
the
organic
factor
is
concerned
it
was
hard
to
appreciate
it
in
the
taste
i
would
not
buy
this
again
and
for
those
of
you
who
disagree
i
will
tell
you
that
my
beer
was
fresh
and
why
bother
with
some
beers
when
there
are
other
beers
in
the
style
that
have
more
to
offer
i
am
done
with
being
diplomatic
about
soso
beers
life
is
short
and
i
do
not
have
time
to
buy
beer
that
does
not
satisfy
my
taste
if
you
like
this
beer
then
i
say
to
each
his
own
d
very
good
drinkability
with
a
great
malty
backbone
spiciness
makes
this
a
great
drinking
brown
that
was
truly
delicious
perfect
to
sip
by
the
campfire
earthy
woody
making
for
a
true
organic
experience
pours
with
good
clarity
and
a
dark
chestnut
color
with
a
few
lighter
highlights
collar
of
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
pleasing
coffee
element
along
with
a
sweetness
that
is
almost
lactosederived
in
character
slight
hops
and
a
touch
of
graininess
but
the
aroma
seems
a
touch
disjointed
and
a
tad
sour
on
the
palate
smooth
chocolatey
malts
start
things
off
then
some
hard
carbonation
and
hop
oils
provide
for
a
tough
almost
astringent
flavor
and
mouthfeel
its
not
soft
at
all
and
for
some
reason
i
think
that
a
brown
ale
ought
to
be
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
an
emphasis
on
the
malt
not
the
hop
dark
caramel
and
some
nut
flavors
hazelnuts
not
much
though
not
as
satisfying
as
other
nut
browns
ive
had
in
the
past
a
little
over
carbonated
for
my
taste
in
an
english
style
beer
dont
drink
and
review
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
isnt
the
most
interesting
or
complex
brown
ale
youre
likely
to
find
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
brown
with
some
tan
creamy
head
some
retention
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
caramel
buttery
perhaps
a
little
toasted
or
slightly
roasted
grain
as
well
the
beer
is
a
light
to
medium
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
toasted
malts
caramel
a
slightly
burnt
brown
sugar
flavor
some
hops
in
the
finish
and
a
slight
nut
flavor
or
maybe
butterscotch
in
the
background
this
isnt
a
particularly
complex
brew
but
it
is
light
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
and
has
no
distinctive
aftertaste
one
way
or
another
this
a
fairly
good
english
brown
ale
not
too
complex
and
it
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
id
still
buy
this
beer
again
pours
a
true
brown
with
tinted
head
that
is
full
foamy
and
holds
a
bit
aroma
smells
like
candy
so
odd
not
bad
in
and
of
itself
just
not
a
beer
smell
possibly
there
are
only
early
addition
hops
so
the
aroma
is
all
malt
aromas
and
residual
sugars
taste
is
very
sweet
and
likable
at
first
sip
but
too
sweet
and
the
lack
of
hops
reveals
the
roasted
charred
malt
as
a
detectable
flavor
in
and
of
itself
as
opposed
to
having
some
hops
in
there
for
a
clean
finish
to
mask
the
charred
flavor
directly
where
it
would
instead
be
part
of
the
mix
of
flavors
that
adds
to
the
complexity
and
smoothness
two
extremes
syrupy
sweetnutty
and
charred
malt
sad
the
more
i
drink
the
less
i
like
it
good
in
a
sample
size

is
standard
mediumlight
drinkability
this
could
be
impressive
if
tweaked
and
any
hops
at
all
were
present
in
the
flavor
im
no
hophead
but
i
mean
this
is
not
even
english
kind
of
hop
amounts
its
more
like
theres
hops
in
here
not
a
winner
pretty
light
and
crisp
this
wouldnt
be
a
half
bad
choice
on

d
a
pretty
drinkable

i
just

definitely
if

the
flavor
here
is
a

smoky

brew
even
the

a

just
ok
an
nice
enjoyable
brown
ale
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
even
close
to
being
my
favoriate
nut
brown
it
did
have
a
nice
brown
appearance
with
a
decent
head
but
that
was
its
best
attribute
the
scent
was
fine
but
nothing
spectacular
an
all
right
malty
scent
it
had
a
good
flavor
but
i
wish
there
wouldve
been
a
more
nutty
aspect
to
it
that
it
was
organic
was
a
nice
touch
though
pours
a

with
nearly
an
inch
of
offwhite

nutty

nutty

at

with

roasty
coffee
and
chocolate
quality
emerging
toward

finish
a
slight
astringency
toward
the

too
very
drinkable
one
sip
definitely
invites

wow
what
a
good
brown
ale
a
new
favorite
for
the
style
dhighly
drinkable
a
delicious
nut
brown
beer
the
sourness
lends
it
a
unique
touch
which
will
lead
me
to
seek
it
out
when
i
am
in
a
mood
for
roasted
malt
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
was
definately
translucent
had
a
foamy
head
that
lasted
a
few
minutes
but
then
left
a
small
layer
of
bubbles
as
well
as
tracings
down
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
was
of
oatmeal
and
wheat
bread
tasted
earthy
and
had
a
sweet
ending
to
the
taste
felt
way
to
watery
in
the
mouth
and
left
a
bitterness
that
wasnt
noticable
anywhere
else
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
almost
goes
down
to
quick
i
had
this
on
tap
with
dinner
at
rubys
oyster
bar
in
rye
ny
the
appearance
was
ok
dark
reddish
brown
hue
somewhat
clear
with
a
thick
and
fragile
looking
white
foam
the
aroma
had
all
kinds
of
things
in
it
hard
to
distinguish
from
a
porter
in
my
opinion
there
was
a
little
bit
of
nuttiness
go
figure
the
name
probably
put
that
in
my
head
and
some
chocolate
and
also
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
chocolate
and
caramel
but
not
as
good
as
those
two
descriptors
would
imply
still
those
are
the
first
adjectives
which
came
to
mind
no
real
bitterness
detected
in
the
aftertaste
whatever
hops
are
in
here
are
for
balance
alone
pretty
well
done
overall
but
i
just
dont
get
the
organic
thing
when
it
comes
to
beer
beer
is
already
pretty
organic
i
think
the
ingredients
are
pretty
simple
and
actually
sound
hippyish
and
organic
on
their
own
very
tasty
very
drinkable
lots
of
flavor
and
pretty
complex
without
getting
extreme
in
any
respect
and
without
trying
to
knock
anyone
down
with
malt
or
hops
or
alcohol
overall
a
tasty
brown
ale
the
flavor
profile
was
a
bit
light
however

oz
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
that
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
english
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
solid
malt
base
with
a
nice
nutty
flavor
it
also
has
quite
a
bitter
finish
that
is
a
bit
out
of
character
for
this
style
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
some
malty
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
a
bit
out
of
style
but
not
a
bad
session
beer
one
of
the
better
organic
beers
ive
had
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
color
topped
by
a
light
brown
thick
head
there
is
some
pretty
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
accompanied
by
apricot
caramel
apples
and
berries
the
taste
is
nutty
and
bready
with
some
decent
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
malts
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
i
couldnt
finish
this
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
english
brown
and
this
didnt
taste
like
one
to
me
if
it
were
a
blind
tasting
where
i
didnt
have
a
style
in
mind
i
would
give
it
another
chance
its
not
terrible
just
not
very
good
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
head
that
seems
too
fizzy
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
almost
like

taste
is
also
too
fizzy
hints
of

and
some
coffee
notes
come
out
of
the
taste
not
much
else
follows
the
bottle
is
good
until
august
of
this
year
so
i
have
no
idea
why
it
seems
so
carbonated
somewhat
dull
overall
though
i
could
drink
several
in
a
sitting
and
go
away
happy
ill
buy
more
but
i
like
the
peak
pale
ale
a
bit
more

a

the
organic

doesnt

to

up
to
the

d
an

good

tasty
enough
to

i

about
the

when

simple
as
that
this
was
a
fabulous
beer
more
bitter
than
the

brown
and
finished
with
a

nutty
flavor
the
bitterness
was
balanced
perfectly
by
how

it
has
characteristics
similar
to
both
the

if

with

really
satisfying

easy

would
make
a

for

my

overall
nice
beer
good
flavors
of
bready
roasted

nicely
blended
with
some

sweetness
and
slightly
bitter

recommended
to
all
malt
fans
o
near
average
for
style
o
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
but
as
brown
ales
go
this
one
is
okay
o
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
enough
complexity
and
character
to
be
appreciated
notesif
this
were
a
richer
maltier
brew
it
would
be
outstanding
in
flavor
lack
of
lacing
is
a
problem
despite
some
flaws
this
is
still
a
good
beer
the
taste
didnt
measure
up
to
the
great
look
and
smell
of
the
beer
overall
not
being
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
shipyard
has
done
a
nice
job
of
packing
an
interesting
blend
of
malty
flavors
into
this
brew
i
liked
this
one
i
am
not
typically
a
brown
ale
fan
but
this
one
had
nice
body
to
and
perfect
carbonation
the
breadiness
and
caramel
and
toffee
melded
well
together
to
make
an
altogether
well
rounded
beer
that
pleased
my
palate
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
i
liked
it
pretty
good
thoroughly
drinkable
beer
and
a
couple
of
notches
above
the
usual
in
this
category
from
the
12
oz
bottle
overall
pretty
good
brew
from
shipyard
here
nice
twist
on
a
classic
english
brown
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
o
this
strikes
me
as
unusual
for
a
brown
ale
the
roasty
finish
pushes
the
envelope
but
overall
it
is
balanced
and
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
decent
american
brown
ale
that
i
might
have
again
depending
upon
what
else
was
served
overall
this
is
an
average
brown
ale
comparable
to
newcastle
overall
i
would
without
a
doubt
recommend
trying
this
beer
it
has
a
fantastic
flavor
o
i
love
how
the
smell
of
this
beer
blends
perfectly
with
the
taste
smelling
as
you
sip
gives
you
a
glimpse
of
beer
harmony
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
very
nice
beer

creamywith
al
lot

brown
ale
is
a
very
clear
solid
brown
ale
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
film
and
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
sweet
aroma
like
caramel
mostly
there
may
be
a
hint
of
nuttiness
and
a
hint
of
coffee
but
its
mostly
caramel
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
lively
the
finish
is
dry
and
pretty
crisp
it
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
slightly
astringent
feel
it
doesnt
taste
sweet
like
it

its
pretty
malty
with
a
touch
of
coffee
and
perhaps
nuttiness
theres
a
fair
amount
of
leafy

chocolate
and
alcohol
are
in

this
is
a
solid
american
brown
ale
i
just
noticed
the
blue
star
on
the
orange
background
on
the
label
is
that
supposed
to
make
me
think
of
newcastle
because
i
prefer
this
to
newcastle
i
think
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
the
pour
was
wonderful
rich
brown
in
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
stayed
on
top
forever
seriously
this
had
to
have
looked
better
then
damn
near
anything
else
i
have
run
across
recently
no
joke
just
perfect
aroma
is
dark
fruits
lots
of
sweet
brown
sugary
notes
hints
of
clove
and
light
earthy
hops
all
mixing
together
nearly
perfectly
at
this
point
in
time
nice
smooth
even
carbonation
and
feel
here
now
as
well
really
well
placed
i
have
to
admit
rich
warm
flavor
here
nice
mix
of
pear
light
spice
hints
at
brown
sugar
and
a
nice
even
caramel
flavored
dry
finish
hints
of
plums
pick
up
as
i
finish
the
glass
now
as
well
again
well
placed
and
nicely

factor

this
went
wonderfully

everything
after
shipyard
brewery
is
a
good

brewery
with

picked
up
this
one
as
the
new
seasonal
poured
a
tantalizing
mahogany
brown
with
a
cola

the
smell
was
sweet

seductive
with

and
dark
chocolate
candied
fruits
the
taste
was
rich
and
creamy
with
hints
of
fresh
brewed
coffee
nutty
peanut
butter
and
dusty
chocolate
last
time
i
checked
this
was
a
brown
ale
not
a
porter
but
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
questionable
summer
seasonal
yet
a
good
beer
overall
overall
enjoyed
this
one
bba
does
a
very
good
job
at
just
being
a
simple
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
fairly
stock
brown
ale
nothing
outstanding
but
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
it
overall
very
different
taste
than
i
was
expecting
even
after
the
smell
interesting
in
general
and
not
too
bad
for
the
style
i
think
tell
anyone
in
the
uk
that
they
are
drinking
an
original
brown
ale
and
they
wont
bat
an
eye
lash
except
for
the
slightly
elevated
alcoholic
kick
there
is
no
discernible
difference
this
wasnt
all
that
bad
really
its
clean
and
very
easy
to
drink
its
got
some
attitude
for
what
it
is
yes
sir
i
like
it
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
brown
color
with
good
clarity
on
the
edges
a
2
finger
off
white
to
tan
head
fades
but
leaves
a
small
head
that
lingers
smells
of
fresh
nuts
roasted
malts
some
toffee
candy
and
bready
yeast
no
sweetness
on
the
taste
some
nuts
and
malts
come
through
but
really
not
much
going
on
with
the
taste
this
is
missing
the
sweet
brown
sugar
that
is
in
some
brown
ales
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
overall
this
is
mediocre
quite
sessionable
with
the
taste
being
decent
and
middle
of
the
road
abv
d
it
is
very
okay
extremely
okay
even
not
my
favorite
english
brown
i
prefer
the
oak
pond
or
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
pick
this
one
out
of
a
blind
tasting
if
it
was
side
by
side
with
its
english
counterparts
a
real
treat
for
malt
lovers
or
anyone
who
leans
toward
the
english
flavors
of
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
a
bit
of
nuts
taste
is
good
hops
nutty
a
touch
of
caramel
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
beer
nose
is
a
but
nutty
and
of
roasted
grain
and
a
bit
of
cocoa
while
the
taste
follows
suit
it
becomes
a
bit
too
arid
and
dry
roasted
notes
are
dry
and
smoky
in
an
ashen
sense
like
the
morning
after
coals
of
a
bonfire
average
feel
and
body
but
the
charred
smoke
notes
return
on
the
finish
and
keep
the
drinkability
in
check
a
bit
of
a
burden
to
drink
and
could
use
a
bit
more
residuals
to
carry
through
the
palate
better
f
still
somewhat
sweet
with
some
spicy
flavors
a
little
sweet
brown
sugar
and
almost
corn
syrup
not
sticky
sweet
however
a
little
roasty
flavor
just
barely
more
of
that
bad
bitterness
too
a
drinkable
beer
but
has
some
bad
bitter
flavors
and
not
much
too
the
beer
in
general
tasty
it
would
make
a
nice
fall
beer
as
well
just
a
seasonal
for
the
spring
would
make
a
great
addition
all
year
long
nice
one
from
the
people
at
shipyard
picked
up
a
six
pack
on
sale
for
7
99
poured
into
standard
pint
glasses
dark
brown
color
fairly
good
sized
white
head
lacing
only
at
the
top
of
the
glass
nowhere
farther
down
smell
was
malty
and
leatherlike
taste
was
better
than
expected
nice
dose
of
malt
with
a
brown
sugar
aftertaste
borderline
watery
but
just
enough
body
to
keep
it
above
average
low
in
abv
and
smooth
to
drink
both
help
make
it
very
drinkable
it
may
get
a
tad
boring
after
a
while
but
i
polished
off
three
fairly
easily
a
nice
offering
from
shipyard
and
brewed
to
be
a
nice
session
beer
drinkability
is
what
this
beer
was
built
for
flavors
are
deep
but
subtle
so
you
could
really
drink
the
stuff
all
night
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
a
hard
time
with
brown
ales
becasue
they
tend
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
i
think
shipyards
is
actually
quite
tasty
the
beer
poured
like
it
should
a
real
nice
brown
color
that
wasnt
too
dark
the
head
was
thin
and
dissipated
quickly
the
taste
was
something
i
wasnt
expecting
definite
hints
of
brown
sugar
mollasses
caramel
maybe
a
little
orange
and
coffee
to
but
it
wasnt
terribly
sweet
it
was
extremely
well
balanced
by
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
they
added
there
wasnt
one
flavor
that
was
too
overpowering
and
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
was
great
definitely
a
beer
ill
have
again
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
2010
issue
expiration
date
sept
2010
sampled
on
february

2010
the
pour
is
a
decent
looking
rubybrown
tone
with
a
shortlived
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
typical
of
brown
ales
with
a
significant
malty
sensation
followed
by
butterscotch
or
something
otherwise
as
sickly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
unexciting
the
taste
resounds
with
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
background
of
fresh
hops
overall
not
bad
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
poured
much
darker
than
i
expected
looks
almost
black
until
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
its
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
lighter
brown
highlights
the
beer
has
a
tan
colored
head
with
very
little
lacing
on
it
just
a
small
ring
around
the
surface
the
smell
is
pretty
good
too
very
heavy
on
the
malts
notes
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
hops
fill
in
after
its
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
but
the
hops
are
not
as
prevalent
in
the
flavor
as
the
smell
still
heavy
malted
with
same
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
a
molasses
taste
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
its
very
heavy
and
full
almost
chewy
stoutesque
no
carbonation
bite
or
alcohol
there
is
only
a
slight
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
reasonably
drinkable
beer
more
of
a
sipper
for
a
nice
cool
day
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
i
guess
this
is
going
to
be
a
seasonal
now
with
shipyard
the
pour
is
dark
brown
with
a
slight
head
and
decent
lacing
very
sweet
aromas
the
taste
is
refreshing
yet
cloying
if
that
makes
sense
at
first
the
sweetness
and
malt
balances
alright
but
your
left
with
this
weird
aftertaste
kind
of
sour
green
apple
like
more
hops
and
rounded
out
a
bit
more
this
could
be
alright
as
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
overall
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
but
nothing
great
shipyards
beers
tend
to
have
a
strong
yeast
note
that
does
not
settle
right
with
me
and
this
is
little
exception
the
fact
is
i
find
the
flavor
profile
to
jsut
be
unappealing
d
very
easy
and
very
good
but
since
its
a
limited
edition
whats
the
point
part
of
a
twelver
i
picked
up
for
12
99
a
virtual
steal
twisting
of
the
top
this
brew
has
a
great
brown
sugar
and
malt
smell
a
hint
of
spiciness
but
not
sure
what
pours
to
a
well
brown
albeit
light
brown
with
a
huge
multifaceted
head
taste
is
rather
light
as
i
would
detect
looking
at
the
ac
but
it
is
not
light
on
flavor
or
body
the
taste
is
a
very
steady
balanced
slightly
toasted
ale
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
although
the
taste
is
steady
throughout
the
mouthfeel
gets
a
little
thin
on
the
finish
the
bitterness
is
really
not
evident
only
a
little
more
prominent
at
the
end
where
it
is
still
remains
subdued
and
flat
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
if
you
didnt
tell
me
it
was
an
english
brown
i
would
peg
it
for
an
altbier
this
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
no
foam
the
smell
seems
to
be
very
malty
almost
tangy
taste
wise
i
am
not
terribly
impressed
the
beer
has
a
strong
honey
flavor
but
is
otherwise
unremarkable
its
not
bad
just
seemingly
very
plain
mouth
feel
is
actually
pretty
decent
this
beer
has
some
fairly
good
thickness
to
it
definitely
one
of
the
better
if
not
best
beers
shipyard
makes
d
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
suggest
this
to
someone
experimenting
with
craft
beers
most
closely
resembles
a
michelob
for
a
macro
beer
md
medium
co2
and
body
perhaps
a
little
sticky
but
still
quit
refreshing
drinkability
til
next
time
up
the
ante
on
the
hops
presence
increase
the
carbonation
and
make
it
fuller
dammit
however
this
beer
is
not
nearly
as
disappointing
as
it
may
sound
in
actuality
its
quite
decent
its
just
that
i
expect
more
from
a
brewery
like
shipyard
i
guess
this
is
an
american
interpretation
of
the
english
brown
ale
style
but
there
are
not
enough
of
sweet
creamy
malt
and
too
much
of
oddtasting
hoppy
flavours
for
me
d
a
very
nice
brown
ale
with
a
nice
nutty
carachter
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
i
would
reccommend
it
to
any
beer
conisseur
the
taste
is
very
enjoyable
very
light
very
mild
and
at
4
abv
you
can
certainly
enjoy
a
few
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
and
has
a
surprising
almondy
nut
like
flavor
lurking
underneath
the
beer
isnt
complex
and
there
are
the
slightly
diacetyl
toffee
flavors
there
is
a
slightly
prickly
mouthfeel
very
characteristic
of
the
english
style
there
is
some
roasted
notes
some
bready
malt
flavors
a
tinge
of
hop
on
the
back
end
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
none
too
complex
brown
ale
that
is
simple
yet
very
good
the
prickly
mouthfeel
and
the
diacetyl
detract
some
points
but
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
lchaim
off
the
tap
this
beer
was
a
pale
copper
color
with
good
clarity
the
slightly
beige
head
was
not
much
more
than
a
skim
but
it
left
very
good
torncurtains
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
faint
caramel
malt
and
biscuity
malt
the
flavors
were
very
washed
out
caramel
malt
weak
hops
and
a
hint
of
nuts
of
the
finish
super
boring
like
a
light
brown
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
averagesmooth
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
good
totally
forgettable
d
very
drinkable
with
a
flavor
profile
that
can
be
nicely
searched
and
enjoyed
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
recommended
drinkability
this
is
not
a
favorite
compared
to
the
browns
i
have
been
drinking
lately
this
is
not
overly
complex
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
d
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
brown
ale
more
like
an
irish
dry
stout
an
overpriced
one
at
that
overall
a
disappointment
this
is
the
strangest
looking
brown
ale
ive
poured
instead
of
a
nice
dark
brown
you
get
a
lighter
colored
one
sort
of
tan
not
too
inviting
aroma
is
lacking
as
well
but
the
taste
is
pretty
spot
on
being
a
brown
ale
and
low
in
abv
it
goes
down
almost
too
easy
with
a
nutty
taste
could
improve
though
the
beer
poured
with
a
wonderfully
sized
head
and
a
dark
redbrown
look
to
it
aromas
had
mixtures
of
nuts
esperro
malts
and
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
wicked
good
and
probably
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
nicely
sweetened
but
nothing
too
overpowering
doughy
malts
with
some
nutty
flavoring
mouthfeel
wonderfully
compliments
the
drink
making
it
somewhat
creamy
and
somewhat
carbonated
overall
a
great
brown
ale
3162005
ive
never
really
been
a
big
fan
of
shipyard
but
this
is
one
of
their
better
ones
5
a
six
pack
is
a
very
affordable
price
too
this
pours
a
dark
brownamber
color
and
topped
with
a
nice
amount
of
foamy
head
malty
aroma
with
a
malty
slightly
sweet
toasty
flavor
notes
of
chocolate
as
well
i
guess
this
is
a
brand
new
beer
that
is
going
to
be
released
on
a
limited
basis
in
the
northeast
that
started
february
2005
medium
to
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
very
quickly
diminishing
head
and
no
lacing
what
it
lacks
in
appearance
it
makes
up
for
in
aroma
and
flavor
lots
of
sweet
malt
with
that
trademark
buttery
goodness
mouthfeel
is
alright
i
like
my
browns
a
bit
thicker
and
creamier
flavor
is
good
nice
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bittering
hops
light
caramel
and
buttery
goodness
round
out
this
one
if
it
wasnt
for
the
flavor
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
brown
ale
its
decent
but
thats
about
it
a
very
easy
drinking
brown
not
too
sweet
not
too
heavy
no
overwhelming
or
cloying
flavors
and
finishes
clean
one
of
the
better
ones
from
shipyard
d
better
then
average
drinkability
slightly
different
dim
sure
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
though
it
would
not
be
my
choice
to
worth
a
shot
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
a
smooth
beer
and
goes
down
with
ease
but
leaves
behind
that
chestnut
flavor
roast
on
my
tongue
it
is
good
beer
not
the
best
but
a
good
beer
a
sixpack
would
be
good
overall
just
an
average
brown
ale
nothing
outstanding
to
separate
it
from
the
others
very
easy
to
drink
nice
and
refreshing
i
guess
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
becuase
it
also
seems
pretty
weak
in
alcohol
way
too
much
diacetyl
kills
this
beer
for
me
was
this
intentional
boy
i
hope
its
just
a
bad
batch
although
i
wont
have
it
again
to
find
out
and
boy
am
i
sick
of
typing
diacetyl
bottle
poured
a
clear
brown
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
better
then
average
retention
aroma
of
grain
with
some
roasted
flavour
taste
is
really
malt
but
with
more
dry
notes
then
sweetness
some
light
bitter
notes
at
the
end
with
a
weird
yeasty
finish
body
is
a
slightly
watery
with
some
adequate
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
refreshing
brown
ale
but
something
seems
off
with
the
yeast
first
sip
reveals
a
lite
yet
silky
smooth
body
with
mild
carbonation
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
advertising
lots
of
malt
but
not
overly
powerful
i
get
some
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
with
toffee
too
a
little
bit
of
harsh
burnt
flavor
could
have
just
averted
severe
problems
with
the
beer
there
is
no
real
hop
presence
and
abv
is
buried
too
i
think
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
beer
and
not
be
bored
or
hammered
a
decent
brown
ale
i
hurt
the
appearance
due
to
gusher
action
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
disappears
into
a
thin
top
smells
hoppy
and
slightly
sweet
tastes
slightly
sweet
with
a
good
hoppy
bite
and
a
sort
of
smoky
flavor
kind
of
thin
in
the
mouth
small
carbonation
keeps
it
interesting
overall
a
good
brown
ale
but
nothing
too
spectacular
im
greeted
with
a
very
loud
pop
when
i
pry
off
the
cap
the
some
foam
then
almost
makes
it
out
of
the
bottle
before
i
can
even
pour
it
into
my
glass
great
thock
beige
head
that
leaves
a
thick
foam
that
stays
throughout
all
12oz
good
deep
yet
clear
brown
shoepolish
hue
great
bubbling
and
lacing
just
an
awesome
looking
brown
ale
the
aroma
is
filled
with
very
rich
toasted
and
medium
rosted
mlats
mixed
with
some
english
and
american
smelling
hops
the
great
great
blending
of
hops
and
malt
give
this
beer
a
roasted
nut
flavor
with
some
toffee
notes
as
well
more
like
bitter
toffee
smooth
clean
palate
this
is
a
great
session
beer
md
supersmooth
what
a
great
beer
so
smooth
at
the
end
this
beer
would
make
an
amazing
session
beer
nicely
layered
and
complex
well
done
shipyard
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
thats
notably
clear
theres
almost
no
head
on
this
one
at
all
and
the
carbonation
is
very
low
this
gives
the
beer
an
unappealing
stillness
the
aroma
is
pretty
nicea
soft
maltiness
with
some
caramel
and
chocolate
theres
a
slight
nut
and
grain
character
as
well
the
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
with
just
a
faint
hop
bitterness
not
much
hop
flavor
to
go
along
with
the
bitterness
medium
to
light
in
body
with
some
smoothness
i
generally
like
brews
with
low
carbonation
but
it
doesnt
serve
this
beer
well
at
all
this
is
a
simple
beer
its
okay
but
thats
about
as
far
as
it
goes
the
beer
pours
a
light
brown
color
a
bit
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
it
has
a
thin
off
white
head
the
smell
is
pretty
powerful
it
smells
of
sweet
caramelly
maltiness
the
taste
matches
the
smell
it
is
very
malty
with
heavy
caramel
overtones
there
are
only
detectable
hops
on
the
back
end
of
the
taste
and
they
are
mild
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
low
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
in
general
i
like
malty
caramel
flavors
and
this
beer
does
it
nicely
shipyard
brown
is
many
nautical
miles
from
being
a
great
brown
ale
but
it
is
still
good
enough
to
try
its
a
little
lighter
than
i
prefer
but
there
is
enough
good

to
make
it
worth
an
occasional

with
an
average

and
vrry
little
lacing
smelled
sweet
malts
some
roasted
notes
with
coca
and
light

the
taste
is
a
more
astringent
brown
ale
than
i
am
used
to
but
it
balances
with
some
citrus
and
nuttiness
a
weird
combo
i
know
that
gives
this
beer
a
certaun
strange
quality
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
as
i
said
is
astringent
on
the
palate
which
hinders
the
little
flavors
and
makes
the
stronger
ones
more
pronounced
in
my
eyes
though
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
not
really
ideal
for
sessions
fun
and
a
more
summer
style
brown
ale
this
beer
lacks
some
depth
that
makes
this
a
great
brown
ale
very
tasty
overall
but
begs
the
question
what
would
alan
pugsley
do
not
terrible
but
as
with
their
other
beers
the
strong
diacetyl
seems
a
bit
stronger
than
it
should
d
there
is
a
good
malt
flavor
but
it
is
very
thin
and
could
use
more
depth
and
character
it
just
needs
more
of
what
it
already
has
and
it
would
be
tasty
this
beer
is
a
little
off
the
beaten
path
in
my
opinion
the
odd
musty
metalic
sweetness
thing
isnt
bad
just
different
a
worthwhile
effort
i
would
drink
this
again

special

by
the

token
it
is
a
tasty
brown
ale
that
kept
me
interested
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
overall
its
a
decent
enjoyable
brew
thats
more
american
than
english
in
style

with
some
clearly
english
components
this
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogony

is
full
of

this

i

im
being
kind
in
this
review
hm
not

it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
it
took
ones
fancy
hoppy

ornery
for
a
brown

dry
and
light

just
way
too
over
carbonated
im
not

about
having
this
one
again

but
i
would
not
turn
one
down
either
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
seems
a
cut
above
the
average

product
it
was
a
dark
redbrown

seem

this

this
is
a
welcome
change
this

much
more

than
other
spring
offerings
very
rich
brown
color

is
bursting
with
malts
and
hops
medium
body
and
not
as
heavy
as
the
winter
ales
but
has
just
as
much
flavor
and
appeal
very
enjoyable
and
will
be
missed
when
it
is
off
the
shelves
sure
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
were
decent
but
not
enough
to
say
id
drink
this
again
even
jwd
hb
seems
like
a
better
choice
this
beer
pours
a
nice
shade
of
copper
from
a
twelve
ounce
brown
bottle
it
smells
a
bit
hoppy
taste
is
quite
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
would
expect
for
the
style
the
malt
is
apparent
but
at
times
seems
overwhelmed
by
the
hops
not
actually
a
bad
thing
but
also
not
really
true
to
style
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
i
do
think
its
pretty
good
and
definitely
worth
a
try
definitely
gets
good
marks
for
drinkability
it
was
truly
an
enjoyable
experience
a
clean
dark
brown
beer
with
ruby
highlights
has
a
big
foamy
beige
head
a
smooth
easy
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
carmel
and
coffee
a
quick
burst
of
coffee
in
the
start
of
the
taste
followed
by
some
carmel
sweetness
and
a
dry
hop
finish
that
gains
momentum
thru
the
glass
overall
a
good
year
round
brew
mouthfeel
is
smooth
at
the
start
and
finish
medium
bodied
the
aftertaste
has
some
caramel
and
butter
riding
the
tongue
briefly
i
found
this
to
be
drinkable
despite
the
strong
butter
tones

abv
a
good
session
beer
diacetyl
flavors
are
hidden
a
bit
if
you
like
ringwood
beers
this
is
the
one
to
try
its
not
as
dark
as
i
would
expect
a
brown
ale
to
be
but
it
is
very
falvorful
for
a
mild
brown
definatly
worth
a
try
if
youre
at
federal
jacks
or
in
the
kennebunk
area
i
notice
what
i
wrote
five
years
ago
still
holds
up
except
that
the
carbonation
is
very
high
now
its
almost
spritzy
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
but
the
overcarbonation
is
a
major
distraction
seems
out
of
kilter
for
style
but
not
a
bad
beer
very
little
hops
presence
very
smooth
and
creamy
brown
ale
juicy
caramel
malts
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
the
buttery
tastes
are
nice
in
this
brew
from
shipyard
with
some
of
their
beers
the
ringwood
can
be
out
of
control
in
this
case
it
appears
the
diacetyl
is
controlled
well
balanced
with
a
nice
hop
snap
bite
on
the
finish
very
good
drinkability
that
could
work
as
a
nice
session
beer
pours
an
offwhite
threefingered
head
fades
slowly
and
leaves
some
lace
medium
carbonation
and

bodied

malty

nice

83
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
cumberland
farms
convenience
greenland
nh
this
brown
ale
isnt
really
brown
dark
amber
maybe
brownish
tints
but
thats
it
smells
sweet
and
a
little
malty
but
mostly
just
sugary
and
sweet
taste
is
not
what
i
expect
from
a
solid
brown
ale
tastes
a
little
fruity
and
i
guess
a
little
malty
but
not
roasty
or
toasty
like
i
was
hoping
hops
dont
really
play
a
big
role
in
this
beer
as
for
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
too
light
bodied
to
be
a
brown
ale
even
an
english
brown
ale
very
watery
smooth
yes
but
not
very
substantial
as
a
side
note
i
bought
a
shipyard
mixed
12
pack
and
the
brown
ale
ipa
and
export
ale
all
tasted
very
similar
and
equally
uninteresting
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
ill
look
for
again
poured
a
red
tinted
brown
as
the
name
might
suggest
to
those
sound
of
mind
head
was
limited
but
there
was
a
bit
of
lace
that
draped
itself
out
as
the
beer
level
in
the
glass
was
depleated
the
smell
was
of
wheats
and
malts
and
i
found
a
distinct
woodsy
nutty
flavor
to
it
there
was
also
a
distinct
buttery
sharp
smell
and
a
small
hop
bitterness
lingered
in
the
back
a
very
interesting
smell
overall
the
taste
was
a
dry
burnt
woody
taste
with
some
small
citruisy
flavors
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
which
tastes
more
like
a
tart
chalky
apple
than
hops
but
very
subdued
i
like
the
flavor
although
i
find
it
hard
to
pinpoint
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
smoky
without
the
actual
smoked
flavor
and
pleasantly
carbonated
when
i
see
the
alcohol
content
i
can
see
that
this
beer
lets
you
know
its
slightly
less
alcoholic
that
a
regular
beer
but
its
certainly
not
dramatically
evident
very
drinkable
drinkability
decent
version
of
the
style
with
the
caramel
flavoring
setting
it
aside
from
other
brown
ales
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
a
pint
or
two
though
the
beer
pours
an
actual
brown
color
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
few
really
brown
ales
the
head
is
thin
but
laces
nicely
the
aroma
is
great
there
is
a
strong
roasted
malt
presence
here
the
taste
is
also
malty
really
malty
it
tastes
sweet
but
not
in
a
bad
way
there
are
a
number
of
caramel
malts
in
this
one
a
real
treat
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
has
a
medium
body
on
it
i
find
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
in
turn
very
drinkable
some
may
find
this
to
be
too
malty
but
i
feel
that
this
is
a
true
brown
ale
not
only
in
color
but
also
in
aroma
and
taste
pours
a
deep
brownamber
color
with
a
light
to
medium
head
that
dissapates
quicklyaroma
is
sweet
and
a
little
chocolaty
with
light
earthy
tones
taste
is
pretty
sweet
and
chocolaty
maybe
a
little
to
sweet
not
enough
earthy
tones
for
me
in
this
beer
could
only
have
one
thought
it
was
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
tastes
of
sweet
malt
with
medium
body
a
little
overly
sweet
not
too
many
flavors
kind
of
like
a
sweeter
newcastle
needs
less
sweet
and
many
more
nut
flavor
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
not
being
a
fan
of
the
style
i
was
surprised
by
the
hoppiness
of
this
beer
i
would
venture
to
guess
this
is
why
i
like
this
one
so
much
on
tap
at
federal
jacks
in
kennebunkport
decent
dark
brown
color
thin
tan
head
smell
was
sweet
enough
and
malty
but
had
a
slighly
sour
off
nose
to
finish
taste
was
a
little
dissapointing
syrupy
like
sweetness
but
a
wierd
slippery
finish
lingers
unbalanced
sweet
and
thin
i
think
i
expected
more
out
of
this
maybe
it
was
the
bottom
of
the
keg
i
bought
a
couple
bottles
to
bring
home
and
try
out
as
well
but
the
first
one
i
had
tasted
the
same
call
in
mr
puggsley
this
one
needs
a
little
work
a
solid
nicelybalanced
example
of
a
strong
ale
in
fact
riggwelter
forms
my
mental
template
of
the
style
looks
alright
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
have
a
rich
malt
presence
accompanied
by
a
considerable
hop
bitterness
subtle
roasty
and
fruity
notes
mingle
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
could
be
slightly
more
substantial
wellcrafted
and
traditional
shame
its
filtered
as
i
imagine
live
yeast
would
add
an
extra
dimension
to
the
character
doubtless
a
cracker
on
cask
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
this
has
a
big
body
for
a
brown
particularly
an
english
brown
though
it
doesnt
stray
from
its
purpose
it
has
depth
in
the
feel
too
with
dryness
underneath
a
sweeter
overtone
and
a
certain
richness
to
it
crispness
is
light
but
firm
and
consistent
from
first
hitting
the
tongue
to
the
back
of
the
throat
in
every
sip
while
it
goes
creamy
smooth
for
the
duration
o
enjoyable
beer
to
relax
with
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
the
import
price
is
well
reasonable
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
oatmeal
cookie
dough
and
a
spiced
rum
alcohol
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
toasted
bread
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
fairly
tasty
but
i
think
this
one
has
a
slightly
better
smell
going
on
notes
malty
all
the
way
through
a
good
example
of
an
english
brown
ale
cheers
starts
off
slow
but
gradually
opens
up
and
grows
on
you
with
the
aroma
becoming
more
noticeable
and
the
taste
was
pretty
good
throughout
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
one
that
id
have
again
unique
and
very
tasty
another
score
for
black
sheep
deep
brown
excellent
volume
to
the
head
youll
have
to
wait
it
out
to
pour
the
whole
thing
the
smell
is
more
evident
at
room
temperature
roasted
coffee
as
others
have
noted
and
sweet
carob
good
earthy
flavor
with
more
than
a
touch
of
umami
and
a
whole
lot
of
english
yeastiness
and
malt
i
guess
coffee
and
malt
are
the
predominant
characteristics
it
is
a
little
astringent
but
i
wouldnt
say
bitter
in
the
least
robust
is
a
great
word
to
describe
this
beer
the
roasted
malt
stays
with
you
long
after
the
last
sip
certainly
an
english
brown
with
character
o
decent
smokey
ok
nice
carbonation
if
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
leave
a
flawed
beer
that
still
remains
quite
drinkable
thanks
to
its
positive
elements
poured
a
brownish
body
with
onefinger
head
and
lace
patches
a
hearty
aroma
of
dry
roasted
bready
malts
as
well
as
a
touch
of
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
along
with
a
leafy
grainy
hop
presence
the
roasted
malts
and
bitter
hops
give
this
beer
a
dry
roughish
edge
even
slight
coffee
notes
hit
my
tongue
medium
to
full
body
a
heavier
brown
ale
that
places
the
emphasis
on
dry
malts
and
bitter
hops
as
thats
the
predominant
taste
and
it
finshes
with
a
sry
crisp
bite
some
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
in
there
for
sweetness
but
theyre
overpowered
the
carbonation
and
dryness
made
a
few
sips
rather
unpleasant
or
else
wouldve
given
this
beer
higher
rating
o
another
stand
out
english
ale
and
to
be
more
specific
by
black
sheep
nice
strong
flavors
well
hidden
alcohol
and
very
easy
to
drink
as
it
warms
it
becomes
even
better
i
let
this
review
linger
over
an
hour
which
i
never
normally
do
i
very
highly
recommend
this
one
and
consider
this
to
be
amongst
the
great
english
brews
overall
not
crazy
about
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
but
the
taste
smell
and
appearance
work
out
to
a
nice
english
brown
ale
on
the
bitter
side
of
flavor
but
it
works
well
with
this
beer
paired
well
with
a
burger
for
dinner
and
good
by
itself
after
the
meal
o
so
english
and
just
a
tasty
brew
cant
believe
i
havent
had
this
in
5
years
just
as
fullflavoured
and
exciting
as
the
last
time
i
had
it
d
very
nice
brown
ale
and
one
i
will
drink
again
with
out
hesitation
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
stout
more
brown
than
black
dark
coffee
roast
color
small
foaming
head
with
smell
of
metal
barrel
dark
roast
coffee
with
espresso
taste
to
it
an
overall
good
beer
the
smell
wasnt
the
greatest
but
i
would
drink
it
again
drinkability
an
excellent
session
beer
flavourful
enough
to
keep
me
interested
nothing
too
overpowering
warms
you
up
nicely
i
would
love
to
try
this
with
a
nice
hearty
stew
and
biscuits
o
the
flavors
are
interesting
enough
to
sip
and
savor
although
it
doesnt
go
down
easily
enough
to
be
considered
sessionable
nice
blend
of
bitter
and
sweet
smooth
mouthfeel
and
an
all
around
good
beer
carbonation
is
too
high
for
these
flavours
and
cuts
out
the
finish
unnecessarily
drinkability
not
a
bad
yorkshire
ale
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
this
is
an
extremely
hig
quality
brown
ale
and
probably
the
bench
mark
for
me
overall
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
fruit
and
dark
caramel
malt
mix
very
well
an
excellent
beer
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
see
this
categorized
as
a
brown
ale
im
getting
a
lot
of
complex
malt
but
nothing
screams
to
me
brown
ale
this
could
easily
be
called
an
esb
a
very
nice
english
brown
ale
that
i
would
like
to
keep
around
in
the
fridge
feels
astringent
at
first
with
lightness
in
the
midpalate
finishes
dryly
this
makes
it
a
good
drinking
ale
as
there
is
no
cloying
stickiness
at
the
back
d
quite
i
finished
the
bottle
pretty
quickly
and
wanted
more

i
cant
give
you
a
reason
to
not
try
this
beer
if
you
have
a
second
one
will
be
up
to
you
ive
had
this
beer
several
time
after
the
first
time
i
reviewed
it
and
each
time
ive
had
this
beer
i
love
it
a
little
bit
more
this
has
become
one
of
my
personal
favorite
beers
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
d
the
nice
soft
toffee
and
toasted
malt
flavors
are
nice
but
im
not
sure
if
the
tartness
and
woody
notes
suggest
this
is
old
or
just
the
traditional
flavor
of
this
beer
a
little
more
depth
would
have
been
nice
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
note
seemed
kind
of
like
a
lighter
and
earthy
stout
and
was
quite
enjoyable
overall
its
a
quite
nice
brew
that
is
certainly
drinkable
just
a
slight
cut
above
average
but
without
anything
to
define
it
as
being
anything
great
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
as
usually
the
cool
labels
sometimes
mask
a
hohum
beer
but
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
english
brown
ale
full
of
flavor
and
complex
to
match
and
a
cool
upside
down
sheep
to
gaze
out
during
the
session
drinkability
an
above
average
brown
but
not
among
my
favorites
i
could
have
two
the
leafytobacco
taste
i
get
here
sets
this
apart
from
others
in
the
style
d
pretty
tasty
goes
down
easily
a
touch
light
on
the
tongue
but
other
than
that
a
fine
beer
to
sit
with
for
a
few
pints
notes
very
drinkable
and
while
dark
very
refreshing
i
picked
this
up
randomly
at
my
local
bevmo
and
it
was
very
nice
though
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
not
quite
sure
if
its
worth
the
price
4
50
but
very
tasty
glassware
weihenstephan

the
taste
is
toasty
and

dark

with
a
bitter
sweet
finish
drinkability
this
was
really
good
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
i
wouldnt
rush
to
buy
it
again
but
for
the
style
it
was
a
tasty
brew
some
of
this
review
is
crossposted
on
my
blog
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
amazing
fall
beerwinter
beer
and
the
flavor
makes
it
easy
to
put
a
few
away
d
very
thirst
quenching
for
such
a
full
flavored
brew
and
maybe
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
to
date
the
brewery
calls
it
an
english
strong
ale
and
as
for
that
i
dont
know
i
could
drink
this
until
im
on
my
back

lots
of
nuttiness
some
roast

light
peatyness
some

hints
of

but
very
minimal
finish
just
a
slight
bite
not
sure
how
to
classify
it
pretty
good
drinkable
brown
but
not
outstanding
worth
trying
though
for
sure
im
sure
for
a
real
english
style
this
pales
in
comparison
but
for
us
in
the
states
a
good
english
brown
md
smooth
low
creamy
perfect
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
be
very
happy
lots
of
flavor
but
it
is
gentle
and
treats
your
tongue
like
a
lady
drinkability
personally
i
like
this
more
than
i
loke
most
english
brown
ales
but
it
really
isnt
to
style
id
say
give
it
a
whirl
lots
of
complex
parts
here
dark
roasted

strong

bitterness
up

some
sourness
followed
by
some
very
slight

lingering
dryness
and
bitterness
the
finish
for
something
which
a
high
abv
i
found
it
to
be
quite
watery
yet
fizzy
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
be
inclined
to
seek
out
again
as
a

needlessly
for
the
first
time
since
my
dads
last
visit
im
saying
i
am
glad
he
left
this
beer
at
my
house
recommended
good
beer
got
this
bottle
last
week
at
sams
in
chicago
poured
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
and
a
little
lace
lots
of
aroma
malty
roasty
caramel
toffee
dark
and
medium
fruit
chocolate
and
other
stuff
seems
like
i
could
almost
go
on
forever
if
i
wanted
to
color
is
an
almost
hazy
dark
amber
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
is
some
creaminess
there
from
mild
carbonation
leaves
a
mild
brandyish
finish
could
be
a
session
beer
if
i
were
going
slow
as
it
is
a
bit
rich
d
moderate
definitely
not
a
session
beer
one
to
two
pints
is
enjoyable
but
it
is
by
no
means
the
best
english
ale
ive
ever
had
english
brown
ale
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
english
bitter
oh
well
body
is
medium
the
flavor
is
rich
pretty
dry
finish
bitter
for
a
brown
pretty
easy
drinker
i
had
no
trouble
putting
this
away
quality
brew
future
outlook
well
this
was
ok
but
nothing
really
to
make
me
feel
the
need
to
seek
it
out
again
smells
like
whiskey
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
decent
head
the
beer
is
a
bit
sour
but
still
very
tasty
the
scent
is
the
strongest
point
of
this
beer
in
my
mind
it
is
unusual
but
not
so
off
beer
smelling
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
a
fair
balance
of
hops
but
more
in
a
sour
flavor
than
a
fruit
or
citrus
flavor
i
dont
love
the
aftertaste
buts
its
not
all
that
bad
it
does
go
down
fairly
easy
but
not
my
favorite
style
so
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
too
much
of
this
in
a
sitting
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
overall
the
best
brew
ive
had
so
far
from
black
sheep
its
highlight
was
its
aroma
nicer
head
retention
and
a
bit
more
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
would
have
made
this
an
excellent
english
brown
ale
riggwelter
is
still
a
great
ale
that
i
would
definately
pick
up
over
black
sheeps
other
offerings
down
here
clear
amber
with
a
very
fine
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
the
nose
is
of
herbal
tea
tobacco
and
toasted
grain
with
some
chocolatey
malt
this
is
a
good
tasting
eba
lots
of
soft
but
complex
flavors
going
on
malty
and
herbal
with
subtle
hop
bittering
light
bodied
and
crisply
refreshing
lingering
tealike
bitterness
in
the
finish
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
available
to
me
fairly
drinkable
ale
and
certainly
worth
trying
for
fans
of
the
style
it
is
fairly
assertive
yet
a
tasty
enough
brew
while
i
probably
wont
be
rushing
out
to
try
this
again
im
glad
i
did
and
would
certainly
recommend
it
thin
bodied
with
a
sharp
but
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
its
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
a
couple
i
loved
the
color
of
this
beer
sometimes
there
is
a
lot
of
reddish
hues
in
brown
ales
but
this
one
has
none
of
that
just
brown
and
beautiful
surprisingly
light
bodied
substantial
carbonation
plays
well
with
the
roasted
characteristics
fairly
easy
drinking
but
the
heavy
flavor
keeps
it
from
being
up
there
when
i
discovered
that
this
was
the
riggwelter
i
wasnt
surprised
its
pretty
average
both
as
a
beer
and
a
representative
of
its
style
theres
just
too
little
of
interest
going
on
to
justify
purchasing
it
again
taste
is
of
cocoa
wheat
a
touch
of
coffee
malt
some
spice
in
the
back
and
dark
fruits
overall
not
the
most
drinkable
brew
ive
every
had
the
strong
and
dominating
hop
bitter
aftertaste
is
slightly
offensive
and
would
make
it
hard
to
drink
this
in
great
quantities
i
didnt
look
forward
to
the
next
sip
i
could
see
someone
who
loves
strong
dominating
bitter
hop
aftertastes
really
enjoying
this
but
i
prefer
a
bit
more
malt
ballance
in
my
beer
drinkability
although
the
molasses
character
in
the
nose
and
initially
in
the
taste
nearly
turned
me
off
at
the
outset
im
glad
i
took
the
chance
to
see
it
through
the
bitterness
disappears
after
a
few
drams
replaced
by
a
complex
dynamic
flavour
definitely
one
to
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
to
sip
and
savour
another
respectable
offering
from
the
uks
black
sheep
brewery
very
rich
creamy
and
syrupy
mouthfeeel
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
i
have
nothing
to
complain
about
here
average
right
down
the
line
no
major
faults
but
no
charm
or
likeability
either
forgettable
a
solid
beer
of
a
frequently
bland
style
enough
character
to
be
interesting
bitter
with
some
licorice
and
brandy
notes
dry
with
little
carbonation
tastes
fresh
but
not
all
that
interesting
to
me
i
mostly
liked
the
black
sheep
on
his
back
on
the
label
and
the
accompanying
explanation
of
riggwelter
ive
also
had
this
brewers
black
sheep
ale
which
was
nothing
id
try
twice
mfd
a
great
overall
ale
would
be
great
in
a
session
poured
a
nice
clear
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
hung
around
for
a
few
minutes
aroma
is
earthy
woody
creamy
sweet
and
malty
the
body
is
crisp
but
creamy
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
nice
frutiness
to
the
brew
the
buttery
diacetyl
flavor
is
pleasant
as
i
drink
it
it
becomes
slightly
bitter
the
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
comes
out
a
would
have
a
few
pints
of
this
easily
a
great

this
beer
has
a
lot
more
caramel
flavors
lots
more
malted
toffee
and
lots
more
pale
malt
flavors
there
is
less
astringency
for
sure
there
some
leafy
hop
in
the
background
some
very
subtle
charred
flavors
this
beer
just
got
bumped
up
a
notch
it
is
quite
good
drinkability
fairly
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
from
a
brown
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
or
carbonation
smells
of
sweet
caramelized
malts
with
lust
a
tad
of
light
hops
first
sip
is
very
sweet
with
caramel
notes
and
very
little
hops
finishes
with
a
welcome
bitterness
well
under
carbonated
not
much
happening
here
worth
skipping
this
one
one
of
my
favorite
recent
beers
without
a
doubt
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
in
the
future
d
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
the
bitter
is
just
strong
enough
in
the
aftertaste
to
make
you
want
to
take
another
pull
real
soon
just
to
get
back
that
honey
roasted
nut
flavor
i
see
this
bottle
disappearing
fast
conclusion
in
my
opinion
the
best
english
or
englishstyle
ale
out
there
pure
and
simple
every
time
i
have
this
i
discover
something
new
to
like
about
it
its
complex
robust
and
quite
unique
this
beer
was
a
mainstay
on
my
trip
to
yorkshire
and
the
black
sheep
brewery
is
fantastic
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
go
this
beer
is
absolutely
perfect
for
a
chilly
fall
afternoon
after
raking
leaves
or
a
cold
winter
night
by
the
fire
definitely
in
my
top
10
beers
of
the
world
superb
feel
with
great
carbonation
and
a
truly
quaffable
drink
the
english
love
to
make
dark
strong
ales
like
this
pretty
good
i
honestly
dont
know
what
to
think
of
this
one
i
loved
the
aroma
and
appearance
but
i
didnt
care
for
the
most
important
part
of
the
beer
the
taste
id
might
buy
it
again
for
the
aroma
and
appearance
but
not
the
taste
of
it
its
worth
a
shot
drinkability
not
a
session
beer
but
nice
enough
to
drink
d
a
highly
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
overall
warmth
and
good
blend
of
a
lot
of
delicious
flavors
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
cap
of
offwhite
foam
which
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
toffee
caramel
hay
and
butterscotch
definitely
malty
with
biscuit
and
butterscotch
notes
there
is
also
a
light
mineral
twang
and
some
nuttiness
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
roasted
malt
comes
across
near
the
finish
smooth
and
medium
bodied
this
is
definitely
an
english
brew
and
a
good
one
at
that
i
tried
this
beer
on
february
11
2008
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
reddish
brown
into
the
glass
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
that
lingered
the
aroma
is
primarily
malt
with
a
little
skunkiness
the
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
creamy
with
some
carbonation
the
flavour
is
also
malty
very
english
overall
a
solid
english
ale
bt
nothing
special
keep
this
stuff
away
from
the
welsh
the
picture
of
a
sheep
on
its
back
may
be
giving
them
too
many
ideas
d
good
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
borwn
ales
i
have
had
i
definitely
recommend
it
a
tad
too
sweet
and
syruoy
just
bit
too
heavy
handed
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
nice
enough
as
a
one
off
drinkability
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
a
good
beer
overall
a
pretty
standard
but
good
brown
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
good
on
the
drinkability
scale
that
is
what
english
ales
are
for
mouthfeel
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
me
kind
of
slippery
doesnt
do
a
fantastic
job
of
blending
the
alcohol
it
tastes
stronger
than
its
5
7
an
okay
beer
pretty
rough
around
the
edges
good
creamy
mouthfeel
with
an
ultraeasy
level
of
drinkability
leads
to
an
allaround
easily
drinkable
outstanding
brew
definitely
worthit
and
certainly
recommended

the

caramel
dark

scotch

this
is
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
yet
had
taste
has
a
sharp
almost
acrid
bitterness
that
lessens
as
you
progress
through
the
beer
this
is
what
many
will
notice
first
off
but
after
a
while
you
realize
its
balanced
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
again
caramel
and
toffee
some
vanilla
this
is
a
wildly
complex
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
bubbles
are
a
bit
sharp
particularly
for
an
english
ale
500ml
bottle
purchased
from
lcbo
in
toronto
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
the
aroma
is
lemony
perhaps
a
bit
metallic
flavour
is
a
balanced
maltiness
and
of
a
decent
strength
its
all
decent
stuff
i
suppose
but
im
finding
it
a
bit
boring
really
i
suppose
its
just
not
my
style
overall
decent
brew
different
than
american
brown
ales
where
this
one
is
very
strong
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
american
versions
are
malty
and
sweet
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
lacy
tan
head
it
has
a
very
sweet
aroma
of
deep
roasted
malts
and
it
even
has
almost
a
minty
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
really
good
it
is
a
creamy
sweet
malty
base
with
some
hops
mixed
superbly
at
the
end
to
even
out
the
taste
it
even
has
almost
a
mintyscotchy
aftertaste
that
is
really
pleasent
and
relaxing
it
has
a
velvety
mouthfeel
and
is
perfectly
carbonated
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
am
glad
it
comes
in
a
real
pint
as
opposed
to
a
12oz
bottle
if
you
get
a
chance
to
pick
up
this
beer
do
it
appears
a
brown
caramel
hue
with
an
abundant
amount
of
beige

thick
and
rises

dose
mild

touch

naturally
carbonated

no
cloying
qualities
at
all
drinkability
is
session
material
all
the
way
im
glad
to
have
local
access
to
this
ale
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
im
not
really
enjoying
the
way
it
was
hopped
that
much
too
grassy
and
a
bit
astringent
i
unfortunately
have
a
cold
right
now
but
this
beer
still
tastes
great
and
is
also
a
bit
of
a
restorative
imo
notes
of
fruits
slightly
sour
caramel
malt
tobacco
and
a
dry
somewhat
bitter
finish
great
beer
to
have
on
a
fall
day
or
when
you
have
a
cold
dark
chocolate
brown
with
good
clarity
stout
like
nose
some
burnt
malty
notes
with
a
slightly
hard
edge
quite
light
bodied
in
the
mouth
seems
like
a
true
cross
between
a
stout
and
an
ale
very
nice
feel
although
the
malt
does
drop
off
a
little
just
lacks
a
bit
of
excitement
not
sur
ehow
or
why
this
thng
is
rated
so
well
drinkability
is
great
nicely
balanced
solid
and
tasty
english
brown
over
all
a
good
beer
although
the
taste
was
a
bit
stronger
than
i
thought
at
first
it
wasnt
an
unpleasant
surprise
mouth
feel
was
good
very
easy
to
drink
taste
was
a
good
combo
of
hops
and
malt
like
an
ale
should
be
i
was
impressed
i
would
like
to
try
more
from
the
black
sheep
brewery
this
is
the
first
yorkshire
ale
i
have
ever
drank
so
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
the
smell
was
good
but
it
almost
smelled
like
a
porter
which
from
the
reviews
i
have
read
thats
about
what
to
expect
the
taste
was
a
strong
but
not
overpowering
of
mault
overall
a
very
drinkable
ale
just
not
quite
as
strong
or
think
as
a
porter
but
i
think
i
would
have
been
confused
if
not
for
knowing
what
it
was
when
i
bought
it
ill
have
to
drink
more
to
get
a
better
idea
of
what
it
should
be
nice
drinkability
though
d
not
terribly
impressed
with
this
one
feels
overly
boozy
and
somewhat
one
dimensional
i
love
this
brewery
so
far
ive
yet
to
have
a
beer
from
them
that
wasnt
short
of
amazing
poured
in
the
glass
a
strong
brown
colour
sort
of
an
ales
ale
of
colour
bit
of
dark
amber
and
ruby
show
through
when
held
to
the
light
big
firm
head
peaks
up
and
settles
down
to
about
2
12
fingers
strong
malt
smell
with
some
sweet
brown
sugar
black
berries
and
floral
hops
strong
malt
flavour
with
some
dark
berries
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
smooth
butter
to
even
out
the
strong
flavour
the
mouithfeel
oh
wow
if
this
had
no
flavour
i
would
drink
it
for
the
mouthfeel
alone
pleasantly
coarse
raw
and
granular
something
ive
never
yet
experienced
in
a
beer
i
will
be
stocking
up
on
this
at
5
7
a
tad
strong
for
a
session
beer
and
dangerous
too
you
do
not
detect
the
alcohol
however
its
nothing
short
of
delicious
on
the
palate
it
isnt
powerful
and
moving
but
it
does
give
a
somewhat
smooth
sweet
and
deep
flavor
and
overall
that
is
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
it
it
wont
take
a
place
among
my
all
time
favorites
but
it
is
worth
trying
for
the
smooth
flavor
in
itself
and
on
a
total
side
note
the
cap
has
a
cool
design
i
thought
i
collect
them
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
an
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
notes
of
caramel
with
some
dry
malt
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
dry
malt
with
some
subtle
notes
of
caramel
and
what
i
believe
to
be
a
fuggles
hops
ending
average
body
with
some
medium
carbonation
well
done
and
easy
to
drink
d
a
good
drinker
my
impression
is
of
an
excess
amount
of
malt
that
throws
the
brew
off
balance
so
its
unbalanced
like
the
riggwelter
that
its
named
after
the
beer
was
certainly
crafted
this
way
and
likely
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
find
it
unpleasant
for
the
most
part
so
i
reflected
that
in
my
scores
i
didnt
like
this
nearly
as
much
as
the
black
sheep
ale
i
enjoyed
recently
from
the
same
brewery
usually
in
good
supply
at
the
lcbo
a
very
nice
strong
which
hides
its
alcohol
has
a
silky
mouth
feel
and
is
both
drinkable
and
satisfying
d
overall
a
very
quaffable
brew
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
pours
a
darkish
brown
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
malty
at
the
same
time
with
a
small
hint
of
raisin
and
caramel
the
taste
is
fullbodied
and
malty
with
a
very
nice
aftertaste
that
is
just
right
lets
review
again
fullbodied
malty
smooth
and
a
nice
aftertaste
this
is
definitely
what
i
like
in
a
brown
ale
very
very
drinkable
subtle
nothing
too
fancy
excellent
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
lovely
ruby
highlights
that
only
show
under
direct
light
aromas
of
banana
esters
caramel
malts
and
some
toasty
brown
notes
some
cinnamon
and
gentle
earthy
hops
round
things
out
on
the
palate
brisk
hop
bitterness
jumps
up
first
with
some
bananas
and
spice
then
arriving
on
the
tongue
the
midpalate
shows
off
some
smooth
caramel
malts
and
then
a
sourish
yorkshire
finish
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
but
a
bit
heavy
with
some
sharp
carbonation
that
resists
being
overdone
well
done
beer
here
a
bit
heavy
for
a
brown
ale
designation
but
very
nice
not
a
bad
beerbut
not
highly
consumablevery
nice
aroma
but
a
little
dissapointing
in
the
flavorkinda
bland
with
some
hints
of
the
flavoring
coming
thrubut
i
really
was
expecting
more
d
easy
flavors
make
for
easy
drinking
but
something
about
the
hop
profile
doesnt
seem
to
mesh
well
with
the
sweet
malt
it
seems
as
though
the
question
isnt
whether
or
not
there
are
too
much
hops
but
rather
the
flavor
presence
not
complementing
the
malt
well
enough
still
a
mild
ale
worthy
of
a
sip
d
a
greatlooking
beer
with
overpowering
coffee
flavor
that
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
like
this
beer
definitely
would
recommend
it
a
very
enjoyable
brown
on
the
dry
and
toasted
side
of
things
satisfying
but
i
think
id
only
consume
one
at
a
time
not
a
session
ale
for
me
ale
pours
a
very
deep
amber
with
a
small
tightly
packed
head
smells
of
malt
overly
ripe
bananas
and
raisin
the
initial
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
but
then
gets
taken
over
by
a
nice
roastiness
a
touch
of
smoke
very
flavorful
smooth
in
the
mouth
almost
a
bit
slick
a
solid
beer
i
will
def
drink
again
pours
a
dark
mahogony
with
a
huge
tan
foamy
head
the
head
leaves
great
lacing
making
this
a
real
nice
looking
beer
the
smell
is
all
about
dark
fruit
there
is
alittle
bit
of

fine

to
say
the
least
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
rigged
and
mighty
tasty
malty
overall
drinkability
a
full
flavored
brown
ale
but
i
would
not
have
guessed
it
for
the
english
style
of
a
brown
ale
very
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
i
think
i
could
easily
have
another

it
seems

theres

going

the
can
led
on
tastes
more
like
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
delicious
a
little
bitter
but
very
pleasant
what
i
compare
all
honey
nut
brown
ales
against
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
folks
delicious
tastes
like
breakfast
cereal
overall
we
are
thankful
to
have
this
recommended
to
us
by
benjamin
at
the
brick
oven
bistro
in
sandusky
ohio
we
had
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
him
a
week
or
so
back
and
he
was
able
to
offer
us
some
of
the
premier
beverages
available
in
central
to
western
ohio
this
was
among
the
top
on
his
list
and
we
are
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
the
nose
is
incredibly
sweet
and
rich
akin
to
the
liking
of
southern
tiers
crème
brule
but
to
a
slightly
more
subdued
extent
the
flavoring
on
the
other
hand
showed
a
much
more
bittered
and
even
smoky
approach
allowing
for
a
serious
side
to
this
brown
ale
that
was
otherwise
not
yet
appreciated
this
is
an
exciting
beer
for
a
small
brewery
and
it
leaves
us
wishing
they
had
wider
distribution
to
keep
us
warm
through
the
winter
months
pours
a
slightly
darker
brown
nose
is
great
on
this
one
strong
nut
tones
with
brown
ale
as
well
flavor
is
nice
good
nut
tones
with
malty
brown
ale
aspects
fairly
smooth
and
well
done
easy
to
drink
typically
brown
ales
are
not
really
my
thing
but
this
ended
up
being
a
nice
one
from
jackie
os
great
malt
character
i
dont
get
much
of
the
honey
but
its
a
nice
fairly
complex
malty
ale
the
metallic
character
somewhat
offputting
as
it
warms
aromas
of
acetone
emerge
houston
i
think
we
have
a
problem
drink
cold
and
quickly
the
chomolugma
english
brown
from
jackie
o
is
decent
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
opaque
brown
with
thin
ecru
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
carries
maple
sugar
and
subtle
sweetness
the
taste
starts
as
a
typical
brown
bready
then
transitions
to
bitter
with
a
nuetra
sweet
like
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
brown
and
well
worth
a
try
pours
a
ruddy
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
malty
a
bit
toasty
and
nutty
and
also
some
floral
hops
in
the
taste
mildly
nutty
with
a
good
dose
of
medicinal
hops
not
getting
much
honey
which
is
fine
im
guessing
it
fermented
out
light
alcohol
flavor
light
watery
body
decent
ale
but
only
just
that
4
5
d
really
solid
beer
maybe
ill
actually
order
it
next
time
im
at
jos
the
honey
certainly
adds
that
sweetness
that
makes
this
beer
a
bit
sweeter
and
more
robust
than
other
brown
ales
o
first
offering
ive
had
from
jackie
os
outside
of
their
pub
and
i
must
say
its
a
pretty
darn
good
brown
ale
there
is
nothing
mind
blowing
about
it
as
the
can
may
suggest
but
it
is
top
shelf
quality
and
a
good
ale
to
enter
their
canned
lineup
ill
buy
again
for
certain
and
i
look
forward
to
experiencing
more
offerings
from
the
ever
expanding
jackie
os
brewery
hoo
hah
the
crack
awoke
kong
king
chomolungma
with
its
loudness
setting
off
an
avalanche
in
which
we
hid
in
the
same
crevasse
to
escape
its
wrath
ol
boy
was
looking
at
me
with
all
four
of
his
eyes
until
i
inverted
him
and
began
a
heavyhanded
glug
it
didnt
help
matter
that
he
was
another
craft
brimful
can
but
i
got
him
upturned
all
the
same
the
pseudocascade
was
quick
to
subside
creating
a
dense
finger
of
lighttan
head
as
its
result
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
srm
44
allowing
only
minimal
light
penetration
at
the
edges
nose
smelled
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
peanuts
fudge
it
reminded
me
of
my
latepops
favorite
ice
cream
rocky
road
mouthfeel
was
big
full
and
creamy
and
the
flavors
melded
together
so
nicely
that
it
could
have
been
rocky
road
or
a
liquified
reeses
peanut
butter
cup
but
either
way
it
was
totally
evocative
of
my
late
old
man
he
really
got
sent
by
the
chocolatepeanut
butter
combo
and
went
for
tastykake
peanut
butter
tandytakes
as
well
chomolungma
was
not
really
happy
with
the
way
i
was
describing
him
so
i
began
to
back
away
and
make
my
way
up
and
out
of
the
crevasse
the
finish
left
me
with
notes
of
leather
smoke
and
more
of
that
choconut
flavor
that
had
been
its
trademark
throughout
no
wonder
jackie
os
has
the
solid
stellar
rep
that
they
do
if
this
is
indicative
of
their
beers
i
am
a
selfavowed
hophead
and
yet
i
really
want
more
of
this
one
especially
on
saturday
01
feb
for
the
annual
hula
in
the
coola
day
taste
is
rich
and
chocolaty
with
the
sweetness
pretty
dominant
though
it
never
gets
cloying
as
a
nutty
tannic
flavor
melds
with
some
hop
bitterness
to
clean
it
up
pretty
quick
on
the
back
end
there
is
a
little
mouthfeel
is
really
rich
for
a
brown
ale
but
thats
certainly
better
than
the
alternative
nice
beer
certainly
different
than
your
typical
but
it
works
pretty
well

very

o
an

with
a
little
extra
hop
bite
not
big
mind
you
just
enough
to
notice
the
honey
that
is
advertised
isnt
apparent
but
thats
ok
with
me
beer
with
honey
can
be
too
sweet
to
try
to
convey
the
honey
notes
not
the
case
here
my
first
jackie
os
offering
i
can
only
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
others
and
that
they
live
up
to
how
well
done
this
is
overall
i
havent
had
many
beers
from
this
brewery
but
this
is
one
solid
brown
ale
i
picked
up
a
few
more
canned
offerings
and
i
look
forward
to
them
o
a
flavorful
and
distinctive
brown
ale
in
a
can
recommended
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
solid
brown
with
lots
of
unique
character
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
thank
you
heath
for
gifting
me
with
this
o
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
and
underrated
imo
full
flavored
with
nice
chocolaty
notes
id
gladly
purchase
this
again
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
brown
ale
but
jackie
os
makes
a
nice
attempt
at
a
rather
hard
style
for
me
to
judge
even
with
its
honey
infusion
much
of
that
floral
nature
gets
covered
up
by
malt
and
alcohol
complexities
as
its
sweetness
is
well
attenuated
for
dryness
but
after
that
first
sip
we
dont
care
about
the
honey
we
favor
the
taste
thats
most
present
in
the
ale
and
those
are
effortless
and
complex
super
drinkable
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
it
leaves
a
little
coating
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
finishes
slightly
dry
overall
very
good
brown
ale
overall
if
brown
ales
are
your
thing
strongly
recommend
checking
this
out
tastemilk
chocolate
toasted
malt
faint
coffee
with
cream
subtle
honey
sweetness
and
gentle
roastiness
a
nice
tasty
brown
recommended
overall
not
bad
and
not
infected
the
aftertaste
is
excellent
too
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
i
will
need
to
get
some
jackie
os
nails
this
brown
ale
it
hits
the
brown
ale
right
in
every
direction
not
typically
huge
on
brown
ales
this
however
is
excellence
in
a
can
beautiful
nearly
black
but
it
lets
enough
light
to
create
a
crimson
mahogany
light
tan
head
velvet
textured
fine
even
lacing
aroma
explodes
when
you
open
the
can
toasted
nuts
with
creamy
chocolate
notes
hint
of
honey
and
cereal
grains
its
good
enough
to
put
your
nose
in
the
glass
flavor
wise
so
smooth
perfect
cohesion
no
clash
of
off
flavors
this
is
complex
brown
ale
at
its
best
with
a
nutty
caramelized
sugar
from
the
toasted
malts
the
wildflower
honey
is
full
fermented
out
no
residual
sweetness
you
find
in
most
honey
beers
this
is
a
flagship
beer
for
a
reason
it
goes
great
with
a
romeo
y
julieta
reserva
im
smokin
adding
cedar
and
spicy
republica
de
domincana
tobacco
to
the
mix
i
cant
help
but
enjoy
every
sip
earthy
hops
finish
the
taste
leaving
a
balanced
brown
ale
on
the
table
smooth
even
keeled
carbonation
cleanses
the
palate
medium
bodied
brown
with
enough
abv
too
give
it
more
complexity
on
the
palate
at
6
5
overall
an
anytime
beer
that
im
proud
to
buy
local
in
steubenville
ohio
at
valley
wine
cellar
beer
drinkers
keep
this
stuff
moving
off
the
shelves
maybe
we
will
catch
an
expansion
of
their
brewing
operations
to
see
some
of
their
sours
move
into
mainstream
distribution
im
still
planning
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
brewery
maybe
next
weekend
there
is
a
bottle
release
the
feel
is
balanced
in
a
medium
body
verging
light
as
a
tealike
note
tames
it
down
its
got
crispness
and
creaminess
in
moderation
a
little
thin
and
herbal
in
the
end
overall
nice
light
brown
ale
not
overly
strong
flavors
but
smooth
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
nice
hop
flavor
at
the
finish
works
well
with
the
nutty
malts
and
caramels
worth
a
drink
for
brown
ale
fans
o
i
will
buy
many
more
6

glad
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
8
99
a
6pack
this
beer
was
much
darker
than
i
expected
it
still
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
although
a
little
different
from
other
brown
ales
ive
had
this
isnt
to
say
it
was
bad
it
seemed
more
smooth
or
velvety
than
other
brown
ales
ive
had
the
taste
was
great
probably
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
so
far
a
little
spicy
with
noticeable
bite
but
smooth
enough
for
the
style
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
it
is
the
best
ive
had
from
jackie
os
so
far
nice
english
brown
ale
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
expect
an
english
style
to
showcase
but
really
nothing
wrong
with
this
overall
a
really
nice
take
on
a
solid
base
beer
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
found
this
one
fairly
easy
to
drink
the
aroma
was
really
very
well
done
i
have
to
say
rich
notes
of
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
chocolate
were
riddled
throughout
really
a
very
big
aroma
here
with
some
nice
touches
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
a
woodsy
peat
like
aroma
the
flavor
was
very
nice
as
well
warming
with
a
rich
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
very
coating
though
i
have
to
admit
it
did
come
across
a
touch
light
on
the
feel
for
me
overall
impression
enjoyable
complexity
and
wellcrafted
a
pretty
good
nut
brown
i
really
like
the
coffee
notes
found
in
this
beer
but
there
is
just
something
keeping
it
from
being
stellar
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
touch
of
head
vry
crisp
and
clear
on
the
corners
of
the
glass
smells
lightly
of
roast
and
coffee
a
touch
of
sweet
malts
with
a
semisweet
chocolate
aroma
by
light
on
the
tongue
but
full
of
flavour
tons
of
coffee
and
roast
a
hint
of
chocolate
sme
nice
almost
caramel
as
well
solid
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
so
thin
if
you
can
even
say
that
vry
nice
overall
fo
good
beer
nice
mix
of
coffee
and
chocolate
on
tap
the
pub
poured
into
a
tulip
medium
brown
pour
nice
red
in
the
middle
nice
light
tan
carbonation
the
aroma
is
malty
caramel
bread
honey
a
hint
of
cherry
a
little
nut
yummy
and
complex
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
sweet
notes
of
honey
cherry
and
nuts
but
a
little
coffee
to
balance
this
out
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
out
this
organic
brew
but
it
came
together
really
well
my
favorite
non
bottled
beer
of
the
weekend
this
is
a
very
drinkable
tasty
rendition
of
the
style
one
worth
drinking
and
even
seeking
out
nice
looking
beer
good
dark
color
a
nice
sweet
smell
to
the
beer
malty
but
not
much
else
there
taste
gives
off
a
sudden
blast
of
sweet
brown
sugar
a
decent
brown
ale
a
great
balance
and
mouthfeel
gives
a
crisp
splash
of
carbonation
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
which
is
a
nice
taste
good
beer
drinkability
my
second
offering
from
jackie
os
and
another
solid
beer
you
can
definitely
taste
the
same
roasted
barley
and
earthy
flavors
in
both
of
their
beers
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
o
a
nicely
done
english
style
brown
ale
o
very
much
an
american
style
brown
ale
robust
roast
robust
sweetness
robust
bitterness
topnotch
still
not
quite
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
brown
ale
smooth
for
7
abv
with
a
balanced
profile
of
nutty
toasted
and
sweet
malt
notes
hints
of
roast
and
sweetness
but
nothing
really
interrupts
the
brown
aspects
of
this
one
outlier
review
too
much
carbonation
for
me
a
solid
all
round
brown
ale
pours
a
deep
rich
brown
with
a
foamy
head
toasted
nut
on
the
nose
which
really
comes
through
on
the
palate
smooth
mouthfeel
disguises
the
7
well
here
good
but
not
the
best
overall
this
beer
is
mild
and
sweet
without
being
cloying
and
very
easy
to
drink
you
would
never
surmise
the
7
abv
boffo
brown
ales
delectable
nutty
malty
notes
make
it
the
beer
version
of
pringles
once
you
pop
you
cant
stop
heck
i
tried
to
resist
but
next
thing
i
knew
the
whole
bottle
was
gone
of
course
this
also
makes
it
pretty
mainstreamfriendly
too
nearly
as
unremarkable
as
it
is
nice
taj
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
small
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
little
bit
of
lacing
around
the
edges
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
molasses
with
roasted
nuts
and
chocolate
a
hint
of
booze
the
taste
is
rather
similar
sweet
roasted
chocolate
malts
molasses
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
hint
of
caramel
as
well
has
a
nice
earthiness
to
it
some
lightly
roasted
nuts
has
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
and
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
medium
bodied
a
bit
thick
and
chewy
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
style
but
one
of
the

was
interested

in

when

popped
the

my
pour
was
rather
light
so
as
not
to
stir
them
up
there
was
nothing
but
wisps
as
a
result
so
i
employed
a

stirred
it
up

american

a
hearty

this

is

and
thankfully
this
is
a
nearunqualified
hit
it
doesnt
hit
all
of
my
buttons
perfectly

it
is

had

the
taste
was
a

nutty
some
toffee
flavors
with
licorice
flavors
flavors
were
a

would
repurchase
odeasily
in

for
the
prestigious
worst

ever

looks
like
a

i
digress
the
beer
was
cool
but
jesus
that
label
the
nose
has
a
medium
maltiness
to
it
some
bread
and
a
little
sweetness
but
there
are
also
hints
of
wood
and
bourbon
this
continues
into
the
flavor
but
with
more
intensity
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
medium
caramel
malty
drink
with
huge
bourbon
and
oak
notes
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
it
is
possibly
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brown
it
has
some
good
subtle
qualities
that
you
wont
find
in
the
big
corporate
brands
pours
a
deep
unclear
brown

creamy
nutty
aromas

followed
by
malted
milk
toasted
grain
and

lightly
sweet
chocolate
and
dark

flavors
and
a
bit
of
nutty
roasted
coffee
as
well
some
earthy
hops
join
in
and
linger
into
the
finish
along
with
a
dark
fruitiness
not
as
impressive
as
other
malty
dark
horse
beers
but
this
still
manages
to
stand
out
from
the
pack
overall
its
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
the
only
complaint
would
be
that
none
of
the
taste
such
as
the
toffee
or
nutty
upfront
are
gig
enough
seems
like
you
get
some
nice
small
tastes
then
they
fad
quickly
i
would
pick
this
beer
up
again
if
it
were
in
my
area
o
just
a
touch
too
strong
to
be
sessionable
but
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
i
could
see
myself
going
to
this
one
more
regularly
if
it
was
more
easily
acquired
available
across
the
river
in
nyc
but
not
super
easy
to
find
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
coloring
with
chestnut
highlights
and
a
creamy
dense
low
profile
head
that
clings
to
everything
aromas
of
cream
and
nut
sweet
with
a
touch
of
roast
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
with
a
hazelnut
sweetness
and
a
bitter
roast
undertone
bitterness
helps
to
balance
the
brew
smooth
creamy
body

a
light
sweet
nut
aftertaste
slightly
lingering
filmy
finish
but
pleasant
o
a
top
notch
brown
ale
loaded
with
character
and
well
balanced
between
nutty
sweetness
dry
roast
and
earthy
hops
carries
an
ethereal
bigness
that
belies
a
relatively
low
abv
this
is
a
maltbomb
and
i
like
it
this
a
simple
beer
in
the
sense
that
it
doesnt
offer
layers
of
flavor
but
what
it
does
offer
is
really
good
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
but
this
is
one
i
could
definitely
drink
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
stumbled
upon
but
what
else
could
someone
expect
from
dark
horse
a
tasty
brown
ale
id
love
a
head
and
some
lacing
on
this
beer
but
you
cant
have
it
all
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
smooth
easy
drinking
solid
abv
and
most
importantly
tastes
good
overall
it
must
be
because
it
follows
the
style
of
an
english
brown
ale
that
i
dont
like
this
it
is
the
worst
brown
ale
ive
ever
tried
but
im
used
to
mostly
drinking
american
browns
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
some
red
highlights
the
head
is
cream
colored
and
thin
just
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
and
not
much
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
sweet
malt
aromas
and
hints
of
fresh
wood
the
smell
is
decent
i
just
wishing
it
had
a
little
more
of
something
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
decent
toasted
flavor
with
a
subtle
coffee
note
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
decent
carbonation
very
drinkable
overall
its
a
good
brown
ale
o
id
have
this
again
not
a
standout
but
yet
another
good
beer
made
in
michigan
this
is
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
not
sure
why
ba
lists
it
as
an
english
brown
though
when
the
company
lists
it
as
an
american
brown
ale
besides
the
higher
abv
this
is
your
traditional
brown
ale
right
here
its
fine
but
not
as
interesting
as
i
remembered
mouthfeel
is
overly
watery
o
well
done
coffee
roast
taste
without
that
roast
bitterness
id
get
it
again
overall
a
very
roasty
nutty
bready
malty
brew
solid
offering
perfect
for
cold
winter
weather
not
to
style
but
tasty
overall
an
odd
beer
some
of
the
bottles
tasted
off
in
the
mix
pack
i
tasted
from
but
the
brown
was
consistently
sweeter
and
lightly
sour
o
really
good
brown
ale
very
well
balanced
i
recommend
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
still
a
nice
mild
yet
complex
and
enjoyable
pour
im
impressed
by
the
finish
but
i
kind
of
wish
it
was
a
little
sweeter
up
front
to
balance
it
out
just
a
bit
more
o
a
good
brown
especially
if
you
like
your
browns
on
the
dry
side
with
some
smoke
and
mild
sweetness
this
beer
was
a
hazy
brown
dark
amber
color
that
i
couldnt
see
through
the
nose
is
mild
and
barely
does
the
taste
justice
there
is
a
light
amount
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
in
this
brown
ale
it
also
has
a
lot
of
an
earthy
spice
there
is
a
bunch
of
nutty
flavors
in
this
beer
as
well
as
quite
a
bit
of
toffee
the
english
aspect
of
this
beer
shines
though
in
the
yeast
and
i
think
the
crisp
yeast
flavor
compliments
the
flavors
quite
well
the
mouth
feel
could
be
a
bit
heavier
in
my
opinion
but
its
still
quite
nice
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
about
on
par
with
bells
best
brown
the
complexities
of
the
beers
alcohol
makes
me
read
boldness
and
betterness
but
the
grain
flavor
and
texture
exposes
it
a
bit
and
makes
me
think
its
pushing
a
bit
too
hard
despite
the
nitpick
the
beer
has
won
me
over
as
one
that
straddles
averys
ellies
brown
ale
and
dogfish
head
india
brown
ale
in
the
bottle
this
has
a
deep
sweet
chocolate
quality
with
some
earth
and
some
lively
fine
granulated
sugar
a
shame
that
that
such
a
gorgeous
beer
to
smell
diliutesd
so
much
once
it
hits
the
glass
still
it
looks
great
in
the
glass
being
extremely
dark
brown
with
an
easy
effortless
2
inchg
rocky
tan
head
and
rings
of
lacing
with
every
sip
there
is
an
interesting
deep
damp
sweet
taste
here
with
some
dry
earth
bittereness
and
a
trace
of
the
forementioned
granulated
sugar
not
at
all
heavily
bodies
but
there
is
a
siggestion
of
some
weight
there
which
brings
something
enveloping
and
dominant
to
the
mouthfeel
very
interesting
and
thought
provoking
but
funnily
not
a
beer
which
really
goes
for
pleasure
i
tried
this
beer
at
the
midwest
brewfest
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
and
a
little
murky
with
some
reddish
highlights
a
thin
tan
collar
formed
during
the
pour
the
beer
looked
a
little
flat
as
it
was
filling
the
glass
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
malty
aroma
big
bread
taste
with
brown
sugar
with
some
roast
and
caramel
fairly
astringent
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
it
was
ok
what
a
nice
brown
ale
really
smooth
and
good
character
the
complexities
dont
stretch
too
far
but
they
do
take
a
very
nice
ride
with
all
the
stuff
out
on
the
market
brown
ales
seem
to
be
taking
the
back
seat
as
far
as
attention
given
through
the
brewing
process
hearty
and
deep
and
not
thin
at
all
this
is
a
really
nice
brown
ale
gotta
give
some
love
to
dark
horse
overall
a
decent
brown
o
this
is
a
very
good
and
very
simple
dark
beer
it
has
a
very
few
flavors
and
those
flavors
blend
together
to
create
a
very
pleasant
taste
it
has
a
very
good
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
without
much
malt
sweetness
and
the
creaminess
of
the
body
is
something
that
makes
this
beer
standout
from
other
dark
beers
one
of
the
better
browns
around

very
drinkable

the

overall
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
it
brings
a
good

of
fruitiness
that
is
really
pleasant
and
different
i
checked
some
of
the
other
reviews
and
no
one
seems
to
be
getting
the
fruitiness
i
noticed
wonder
if
i
have
a
semiinfection
going
this
is
a
bit
old

damn
if
that
fruitiness
isnt

folks
out

wow
this
is
one

the
top
browns
i
have
had
i
would
love
to
have
this
next
to
samuel

to

what
is

stands
out

here
great
flavor
great
drinkability
othis
is
a
decent
rendition
of
an
american
brown
ale
meaning
i
get
a
pretty
substantial
amount
of
hops
for
an
english
brown
ale
moderate
vanilla
toast
booze
and
earthy
malt
notes
but
mostly
woody
hops
might
be
considered
a
black
pale
ale
not
what
i
expected
and
i
was
between
a
3
and
a
3
5
for
overall
but
the
willingness
to
do
something
different
in
an
increasingly
stagnant
category
should
be
rewarded
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
pretty
looking
khaki
cap
of
dense
foam
that
settles
quickly
to
a
skim
rich
and
malty
cocoa
and
roasty
coffee
like
notes
in
the
aroma
nice
flavors
of
fudge
cocoa
powder
and
a
roastiness
bordering
on
porter
territory
full
bodied
for
the
style
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
chalky
bitter
aftertaste
a
really
flavorful
and
well
made
brown
ale
o
a
good
brown
ale
overall
just
a
few
things
that
i
liked
and
didnt
like
good
nose
lacing
and
others
appearance
traits
but
it
was
pretty
booze
heavy
for
a
brown
ale
i
typically
think
of
brown
ales
as
lighter
on
the
alcohol
and
a
little
thicker
bodied
than
this
one
was
o
while
it
has
a
bit
more
roasted
character
than
is
typical
of
english
brown
ales
it
is
quite
tasty
it
is
balanced
well
with
the
sweeter
caramel
malt
flavors
balancing
out
what
i
keep
thinking
is
roasted
barley
and
that
gives
it
a
pleasant
complexity
that
a
lot
of
brown
ales
lack
complex
malt
aromas
toast
and
caramel
nuts
and
grain
husks
slight
sweetness
at
first
tempered
by
mild
bitterness
that
lasts
into
the
finish
subtle
dried
fruit
sneaks
in
and
intertwines
with
nutty
walnut
notes
dry
and
almost
chalky
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
good
while
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
a
light
carbonation
level
overall
pretty
enjoyable
a
sleeper

creaminess
nice
roasted
aspect

a
bit
of
nuttiness
overall
4
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
but
lacking
some
body
and
sweetness
i
really
like
the
malt
notes
but
its
just
a
bit
too
thin
will
have
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
thick
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
1
inch
caramel
head
quickly
fades
with
some
residual
lace
smell
right
off
is
chocolate
spice
and
caramel
taste
is
almost
coffee
like
very
nice
actually
with
a
good
hoppy
after
taste
this
was
very
smoothe
somewhat
thick
but
not
overally
so
at
all
its
seems
very
drinkable
and
i
was
suprised
many
thanks
to
kzoobrew
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
poured
from
bottle
into
dfh
snifter
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
opaque
color
nice
thick
chewy
looking
head
recedes
and
a
light
tan
ring
remains
and
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
this
looks
like
a
great
beer
barely
any
light
gets
through
smell
nutty
toffee
faint
brown
sugar
taste
warm
nutty
caramel
contrasted
by
a
bitter
roasted
malt
that
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
maybe
just
a
slight
bit
of
astringency
but
it
works
well
with
the
balance
carbonation
is
a
little
sharp
and
makes
it
a
little
difficult
to
get
all
the
flavors
overall
im
a
fan
a
nice
beer
from
dark
horse
that
i
would
have
again
o
a
very
good
brown
ale
good
combination
of
flavors
nothing
overpowering
well
balanced
a
little
thicker
body
and
it
would
be
a
solid
a
or
even
an
a
i
think
excellent
creamy
but
more
importantly
an
incredibly
creamy
drinkable
brown
ale
my
lord
dark
horse
is
just
another
example
of
quality
michigan
brewing
kudos
overall
i
love
a
good
brown
ale
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
darkhorse
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
and
i
love
what
they
do
with
maly
forward
beers
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
bold
ruby
shade
showing
up
in
the
light
half
inch
tan
head
and
lace
till
the
end
are
also
present
the
aroma
is
of
hot
chocolate
coffee
and
light
smoke
the
flavor
is
complex
with
dark
chocolate
mild
coffee
and
sweet
roasted
malt
notes
similar
to
a
doppelbock
with
a
hop
tang
its
mouthfeel
is
medium
dark
horse
boffo
brown
ale
is
a
very
good
beer
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
highly
recommended
o
a
very
different
kind
of
brown
ale
to
me
anyway
i
enjoyed
it
though
pours
a
very
dark
amber
small
off
white
head
aroma
of
caramel
and
earthy
hops
in
the
taste
mellow
burnt
caramel
toasted
malt
even
bitterness
with
tea
like
hops
nutty
with
light
coffee
flavor
in
the
finish
with
some
residual
chalky
yeast
medium
bodied
brew
nice
full
rich
malty
body
hop
presence
is
mild
a
very
nice
brown
ale
overall
quite
impressive
overall
its
all
right
im
happy
to
finish
the
glass
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
again
o
as
the
beer
warmed
it
got
better
when
i
first
opened
this
and
took
a
drink
it
screamed
infection
though
it
wasnt
infected
it
did
have
intense
flaws
that
unfortunately
overtook
the
majority
of
the
drinking
experience
brown
body
with
a
thin
layer
of
tan
head
nose
is
nutty
bread
and
some
unsweetened
chocolate
flavor
is
a
mix
of
roasted
malts
and
a
sharp
caramel
sweetness
there
is
a
sharp
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
is
metallic
and
has
a
hint
of
floral
hops
beer
has
a
light
body
and
overall
the
flavor
was
alright
but
the
finish
was
off
overall
the
aroma
and
taste
was
pretty
solid
ill
have
to
give
this
one
another
try
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
replete
with
finely
nuanced
and
wellcrafted
flavors
that
burst
delightfully
on
the
tongue
o
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
if
this
is
your
style
id
say
pick
this
one
up
for
sure
d
ive
been
very
impressed
with
a
lot
of
dark
horses
offerings
and
this
one
certainly
did
not
let
me
down
a
relatively
low
abv
yet
packed
with
bold
flavor
i
would
recommend
this
to
my
craft
beer
drinking
friends
any
day
of
the
week
o
this
beer
is
pretty
boring
but
its
nonoffensive
something
you
can
pretty
much
drink
and
not
notice
not
going
to
try
to
find
this
again
nothing
that
will
excite
the
tastebuds
but
pleasant
and
well
balanced
for
the
style
dark
brown
and
a
little
murky
with
some
reddish
highlights
a
thin
tan
collar
formed
during
the
pour
the
beer
looked
a
little
flat
as
it
was
filling
the
glass
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
malty
aroma
bread
and
brown
sugar
with
some
roast
caramel
and
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
leafy
bitterness
with
sweet
malts
up
front
caramel
and
bread
dry
roastiness
in
the
finish
nutty
fairly
astringent
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
6
5
abv
is
a
little
high
and
keeps
it
from
being
a
good
session
beer
for
me
which
is
how
i
tend
to
like
my
brown
ales
overall
ehh
i
pretty
much
had
this
since
i
had
most
of
dark
horses
other
offerings
and
its
clear
that
its
a
well
made
brown
ale
but
something
i
wouldnt
get
again
will
stick
with
their
stouts
since
i
love
em
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
brown
ale
it
has
the
classic
brown
ale
taste
and
is
well
balanced
with
a
very
nice
texture
this
is
very
drinkable
and
would
make
a
good
beer
to
have
with
friends
while
chatting
about
old
times
overallfirst
few
sips
werent
all
that
bad
but
started
tasting
pretty
awful
look
and
taste
is
pretty
unimpressive
ill
pass
on
this
for
now
on
brown
ale
is
a
style
i
approach
with
hesitancy
because
there
are
so
many
terrible
brown
ales
on
the
market
today
mostly
watery
bitter
pale
ales
with
brown
coloring
fortunately
this
beer
comes
across
with
some
muscle
but
not
so
much
that
it
terrifies
the
children
or
causes
old
women
to
pass
out
on
the
sidewalk
the
aroma
and
taste
both
approach
ukstout
territory
quite
fruity
with
an
emphasis
on
oranges
yet
with
a
dry
finish
plenty
of
charcoal
and
roasted
whateveritis
provide
enough
complexity
without
much
intellectual
hooey
a
fine
accompaniment
to
a
big
plate
of
pancakes
the
beer
is
very
creamy
and
very
smooth
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
the
taste
has
all
the
great
characteristics
for
the
style
but
there
is
a
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
that
may
be
warranted
perhaps
no
im
just
really
enjoying
the
creamy
roasted
notes
and
the
bittering
cooking
chocolates
and
then
bam
this
really
leafy
bittering
hop
and
drying
punch
hits
you
in
the
finish
its
okay
but
im
marking
it
down
as
a
flaw
in
the
beer
although
some
folks
may
like
it
the
punch
lasts
well
into
the
finish
and
is
just
more
than
i
wanted
the
beer
is
quite
good
i
just
wish
the
finish
were
lest
impactful
o
not
a
bad
drink
but
nothing
great
either
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
dark
horse
beer
while
dark
horse
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
think
ill
stick
with
bells
best
brown
ale
or
michigan
bcs
nut
brown
ale
when
it
comes
to
drinking
an
english
brown
ale
nice
beer
worth
trying
boffo
indeed
overall
this
is
a
very
underwhelming
beer
for
me
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
watery
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
had
just
about
everything
i
look
for
in
a
brown
ale
and
its
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
tried
it
had
a
heavier
roast
then
most
brown
ales
but
i
thought
it
worked
well
in
this
brew
and
i
liked
it
it
went
down
smooth
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
drink
it
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
this
style
dark
horse
has
one
solid
brown
ale
on
their
hands
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
thin
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lots
of
caramel
some
toffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
easy
drinking
nothing
aggressive
or
out
of
place
overall
this
is
a
very
smooth
brown
ale
that
seems
a
little
more
heavily
roasted
than
typical
for
the
style
quite
delicious
and
one
of
the
better
english
brown
ales
i
have
had
drinkability
was
pretty
good
nice
smelling
and
tasting
pretty
good
but
the
bubbly
quality
takes
it
down
a
hair
still
its
a
mighty
fine
brown
pours
coffee
brown
with
everlasting
off
white
head
brown
sugar
with
some
brownies
in
the
aroma
brownies
brown
sugar
spice
gingerbread
and
tang
towards
the
finish
heavy
body
with
medium
carbonation
mild
in
flavors
not
so
aggressive
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
had
this
ondraft
3
a
pint
night
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
chocolate
brown
with
a
light
head
tones
of
nut
and
coal
clean
and
crisp
flavor
of
coffee
nut
and
coal
no
after
taste
goes
down
nice
and
easy
my
brother
sisupride
would
love
this
beer
my
first
brew
i
have
had
from
dark
horse
brewing
co
and
they
did
great
michigan
is
truly
a
great
place
for
hand
crafted
beers
on
tap
last
night
at
canary
sq
in
jp
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
some
lacing
smell
had
a
nice
nutty
coffee
aroma
to
it
flavor
was
very
tasty
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
just
a
bit
of
toffee
were
blended
in
there
nicely
mouthfeel
was
decent
not
thick
but
not
watery
i
thought
this
was
an
easy
beer
to
drink
at
6
5
a
well
made
brown
ale
that
id
have
again
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
browns
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
quick
diminishing
head
scents
of
sweet
cocoa
with
some
coffee
hints
very
robust
malts
that
again
have
the
taste
of
cocoa
and
coffee
very
flavorful
as
it
basically
a
step
below
the
bold
taste
of
a
stout
if
youre
into
dark
and
heavy
beers
thois
is
a
must
try
on
tap
at
churchkey
in
washington
dc
poured
into
snifter
glass
served
in
near
room
temperature
which
is
the
norm
at
churchkey
pours
a
soft
brown
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
quickly
fizzles
but
retains
thin
lacing
throughout
the
drinking
session
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
bready
with
plenty
of
chocolate
malt
and
a
nice
toasted
grain
note
flavor
is
sweeter
with
an
even
bigger
chocolate
character
a
bit
of
a
burnt
roasted
note
but
mostly
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
and
a
subtle
but
present
earthy
hop
balance
in
the
finish
medium
body
and
a
bit
of
a
sharper
carbonation
pretty
good
english
brown
ale
imo
certainly
a
great
brown
ale
to
have
on
tap

d
pretty

lots
of
what
i
like
in

if
it
was

sweeter
and
creamier
dark

a
finger

dark
brown
brew
the
nose

inviting
semisweet
chocolate
with
a
little

that
note

brown
ales
tend
to
get
overlooked
everybodys
running
after
their
ipas
belgians
or
the
newestweirdest
barrelaged
concoction
people
tend
to
forget
how
good
a
brown
ale
can
be
packing
a
lot
of
flavor
in
what
is
still
a
pretty
modest
easy
drinking
beer
just
like
this
one
md
on
the
lighter
side
with
moderate
carbonation
and
slightly
creamy
overall
its
ok
have
had
better
but
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
dark
horse
does
not
dissapoint
the
dark
horse
website
tells
me
this
is
actually
6
5
which
is
fine
but
as
a
session
beer
lover
i
wish
this
brown
were
a
tough
lighter
and
less
alcoholic
not
that
im
complaining
thats
just
personal
preference
this
is
a
mighty
fine
brown
ale
drinkability
an
average
english
brown
i
could
have
a
couple
but
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
i
would
have
first
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
overly
memorable
either
da
really
pleasant
sessionable
drinker
overall
a
pretty
standard
but
good
brown
ale
worth
a
try
d
pretty
drinkable
but
your
typical
brown
ale
very
smoky
and
roasty
for
a
brown
ale
but
i
like
it
would
definitely
drink
it
again
d
not
your
typical
maltysweet
brown
ale
welcome
levels
of
roast
smoke
and
bitterness
classy
drinkability
is
solid
very
good
flavors
low
abv
great
mouthfeel
d
good
overall
but
i
probably
wont
be
stocking
up
on
it
this
is
a
really
solid
all
around
brown
and
another
winner
from
dark
horse
lots
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
as
well
i
could
tip
back
a
couple
of
these
with
ease
pours
a
nice
brown
color
that
is
slightly
opaque
off
white
head
with
a
pretty
good
amount
of
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
the
nose
brings
sweet
malt
caramel
toffee
a
bit
of
fruit
and
some
nice
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
good
blend
of
hops
and
malt
with
the
combination
really
shining
through
in
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
quite
good
and
it
was
a
nice
brew
on
my
first
trip
finally
to
the
brewery
this
beer
pours
with
a
lot
of
head
on
it
too
much
if
you
ask
me
but
the
nice
taupe
head
caps
off
a
beautiful
deep
dark
brown
color
that
has
faint
ruby
twinges
when
closely
examined
the
smell
is
coffeelike
in
nature
but
with
a
blend
of
toffee
mixed
in
as
well
as
some
cocoa
powder
the
flavor
of
the
cocoa
powder
is
strongest
on
the
palate
but
there
is
some
molasses
character
coming
through
as
well
there
might
be
a
hint
of
toffee
all
of
the
flavors
are
really
mellow
in
this
beer
nothing
is
potent
or
overwhelming
which
also
means
that
there
isnt
any
distinct
character
as
well
the
cocoa
flavor
on
the
mouthfeel
actually
almost
dried
out
the
tongue
but
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
actually
made
it
still
a
good
drinking
beer
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
and
something
i
would
definitely
look
for
again
on
tap
overall
would
be
a
great
food
beer
this
is
a
delightful
brown
ale
big
and
chewy
with
a
great
supporting
hop
bitterness
great
drinkability
for
a
darker
heavier
beer
i
will
say
though
the
first
few
bottles
were
a
bit
flat
if
you
buy
it
fresh
give
them
a
few
weeks
in
the
bottle
and
they
carb
up
nicely
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
is
unsettling
and
inexplicable
what
does
it
mean
this
brown
ale
pours
very
dark
brown
to
mostly
black
its
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
hints
of
coffee
and
mocha
with
an
apparent
sweetness
its
taste
follows
its
aroma
directly
there
is
an
almost
cloying
sweetness
at
the
beginning
but
it
fades
into
a
nicely
bitter
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
finish
taste
roasted
malts
dark
fruit
more
bitterness
than
you
normally
find
in
a
brown
ale
this
beer
kinda
walks
the
line
between
brown
ale
and
porter
in
my
opinion
another
outstanding
brew
from
the
guys
at
dark
horse
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
is
excellent
but
there
isnt
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
toasted
and
bready
malt
nuts
toffee
and
caramel
taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
and
theres
the
addition
of
a
bit
of
chocolate
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
thought
it
was
a
good
overall
brown
ale
now
im
sorry
i
just
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
id
definitely
buy
this
again
well
done
notes
very
elegant
brown
ale
has
a
lagerlike
crispness
and
drinkability
to
it
awesome
brown
ale
this
is
one
that
becomes
more
enjoyable
as
you
drink
boffo
falls
right
behind
best
brown
and
bender
as
my
third
favorite
brown
ale
very
solid
beer
all
the
way
are
and
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
flavor
is
packed
into
a
relatively
smaller
beer
i
dont
drink
brown
ales
too
often
but
if
i
did
this
one
would
be
a
staple
beautiful
deep
chestnut
in
color
poured
into
my
new
dfh
pint
glass
with
a
thin
foamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
nuttiness
and
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
malty
with
tones
of
caramel
cocoa
and
molasses
and
just
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
a
nice
brown
ale
creamy
and
smooth
light
bodied
for
an
american
brown
but
one
i
would
get
again
drinkability
no
problem
whatsoever
glad
i
bought
a
sixpack
this
brown
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
beigeblack
cherry
head
almost
a
stout
like
appearancetons
of
sticky
clinging
lace
smell
is
toffee
burnt
sweet
caramel
baked
bread
and
hops
taste
is
simply
delicious
its
toffeefollowed
by
burnt
caramel
and
baked
bread
then
you
get
some
roasted
coffee
notes
with
great
hops
and
grapefruit
notes
mouth
feel
is
robust
and
full
this
is
one
tasty
brown
that
drinks
like
a
light
stoutporter
its
excellent
so
tasty
very
recommended
d
goes
down
ok
not
much
of
a
kick
ok
representation
of
style
there
was
something
slightly
off
with
the
blending
of
flavoring
in
this
beer
there
are
better
offerings
out
there
of
the
style
d
this
beer
was
a
good
above
average
try
from
dark
horse
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
sixer
of
it
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
the
style
is
really
not
for
me
d
meh
its
average
at
best
not
doing
much
for
me
its
not
bad
at
all
its
just
average
d
a
very
unique
brown
ale
the
more
i
get
into
it
the
better
it
gets
i
will
be
getting
this
again
d
good
complex
flavor
nothing
overwhelming
but
it
feels
like
somethings
missing
its
very
fruity
and
sweet
but
it
almost
feels
too
sweet
some
stronger
hop
presence
or
maybe
a
big
dose
of
coffee
might
make
this
a
superb
beer
just
thoughts
d
a
good
beer
that
really
fell
apart
just
before
the
finish
for
me
feel
is
great
though
and
nose
complements
the
flavor
very
well
worth
a
try
for
a
twist
on
the
brown
ale
style
its
fairly
drinkable
pretty
light
and
sessionable
but
that
touch
of
briny
salt
at
the
end
knocks
down
a
bit
of
the
drinkability
the
flavor
has
far
more
hop
presence
than
the
smell
indicates
wellbalanced
with
a
dry
cocoa
malt
taste
thin
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
the
weakest
aspect
of
this
beer
id
also
note
a
few
reviews
called
it
too
sweet
try
it
a
bit
colder
i
prefer
it
a
bit
on
the
chill
side
and
i
think
thats
its
best
balance
dark
horse
malts
up
their
stoutsso
you
can
fine
tune
to
taste
by
having
them
a
bit
colderor
warmer
bells
best
brown
is
still
the
best
brown
ale
in
michigan
but
this
dark
horse
brew
is
good
beer
in
its
own
right
whether
or
not
you
think
boffo
is
boffo
will
most
likely
depend
on
how
much
you
like
brown
ales
grab
a
single
or
a
sixer
and
judge
for
yourself
d
nice
roasted
flavor
with
some
subtle
hops
support
there
is
not
much
depth
but
this
beer
is
very
quaftable
not
as
heavy
as
a
porter
and
it
would
be
nice
to
see
this
on
cask
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
bodied
and
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
happily
drink
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
an
excellent
mix
of
toasted
caramel
malts
victory
nuttiness
and
a
dry
roasted
finish
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
flavor
with
a
subtle
caramel
feel
it
goes
down
quick
and
bone
dry
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
im
not
sure
whats
causing
that
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
brown
ale
but
nothing
exceptional
drinkability
a
very
nice
english
brown
that
verges
on
porter
territory
this
is
terrific
and
leans
on
the
side
of
porter
in
my
book
really
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
ill
need
to
seek
this
out
again
nice
and
roasted
but
lacks
some
sensation
worth
sessioning

not

of

no

brown
a
recent
trip
to
columbus
proved
the
fact
that
dark
horse
is
in
full
effect
in
the
state

ohio
i
saw
shot

tap
handles
in
every
fine

bar
we
stopped
at

appeared
locally
so
i
had
to
go
with
it
and
a

one
of
the
most
approachable
brown
ales
ive
come
across
in
quite
some
time
this
is
some
tasty
stuff
strong

has
overtone

and
just
a
hint
of
fruit
texture
is
pleasingly
smooth
with
a
nice
subtle
tingle
worth
hunting
down
first
flavor
to
come
out
is
that
of
sweet
but
not
overtly
sugary
cream
the
mouthfeel
of
the
brew
also
has
a
light
cream
to
it
as
well
now
that
im
mentioning
it
right
behind
it
is
caramel
malts
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
the
finish
has
something
of
a
porter

to
it
with
a

of
bitters
and
bakers
chocolate
dgreat
session
brown
ale
nicely
done

this

had
im
still
glad
they
decided
to
bottle
this
d
this
is
a
really
good
brown
ale

definitely
give
this

d
the

reddish
brown
and
clear
with
a
ring
of
a

some
noble

and
not

aggressive
mmmm
a
nice

fades
into
a

this
let
me
down
big
time
tasted
watered
downabout
the
only
thing
i
got
out

was
a
touch
of

on

anyplace
i
dont
know
how
old
this
is
mouth
takes
a
hit
from
the
pungent
acidity
but
otherwise
pretty
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
and
formed
an
off
white
head
that
slowly
faded
the
aroma
was
of
malt
coffee
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
malt
with
a
elements
of
both
the
coffee
and
the
caramel
the
body
was
rather
light
for
the
style
and
the
finish
a
touch
bittersweet
not
a
bad
brown

not
great
either
this
is
an
easy

poured
out
to
a
muddied
brown
in
the
glass
with
virturally
no
head
aroma
is
that
of
light
malt
taste
was
disappointing
this
was
a
very
thin
brown
ale
with
nearly
no
carbonation
i
am
thinking
it
mightve
been
a
bad
bottle
not
as
complex
as
newcastle
even
which
is
very
thin
in
its
own
right
i
will
have
to
resample
this
one
but
overall
it
was
disappointing
this
beer
poured
very
dark
darker
than
most
brown
ales
pour
and
was
quite
low
in
carbonation
the
smell
was
semisweet
but
that
was
about
it
the
taste
was
simply
an
upfront
maltiness
with
nothing
to
back
it
up
i
cant
find
any
hops
or
alcohol
or
yeast
or
anything
other
than
a
caramel
flavored
malt
too
thin
too
bland
this
should
be
a
macro
a
very
nice
english
brown
ale
hits
the
spot
light
chocolate
caramel
toast
and
a
hint
of
plum
on
the
nose
pours
brilliant
brown
under
a
1
offwhite
foam
cap
with
a
slight
brown
tint
the
palate
follows
the
nose
with
traces
of
nuts
and
chocolate
over
lightly
toasted
grain
and
bright
fruit
a
semisweet
beginning
leads
to
a
drying
finish
very

thought
this
one
was
gonna
be
a
tanker
for
sure
guess
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
appearance
is
obviously
the
weakest
link
in
this
chain
but
the
other
categories
more
than
make
up
for
that
its
a
great
beer
worthy
of
a
sixer

is
a
bold

nice

big

and
subtle
hints

good
body
overall
a
very
nice
creamy
and
flavored
brown
ale
overall
i
am
often
dissapointed
with
brown
ales
because
they
will
deliver
a
simple
maple
sweetness
without
depth
or
complexity
this
brown
ale
however
has
scrumptuous
depth
to
its
sweet
complex
flavor
i
would
definitely
have
more
of
this
in
fact
i
think
ill
have
more
now
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
but
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
screams
at
you
for
attention
brown
ales
are
far
from
my
favorite
style
but
i
try
and
review
to
the
style
so
keep
that
in
mind
easy
to
drink
and
inoffensive
worthy
of
consideration
but
their
are
better
browns
avaiable
would
definitely
try
it
again
and
maybe
get
a
session
in
with
it
to
really
test
drive
it
if
i
would
get
the
opportunity
o
a
bit
sweet
particularly
for
the
english
variety
this
is
a
brown
that
has
been
very
well
done
living
in
wisconsin
makes
it
hard
to
find
thankfully
minnesota
is
just
an
hour
away
worth
the
drive
to
pick
up
a
few
cases
of
this
beer
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
that
has
me
wanting
more
and
more
it
feels
a
little
grainy
in
the
mouth
but
has
a
great
finish
not
to
bitter
overall
a
beer
i
am
surprisingly
digging
brown
ales
arent
the
most
sexy
beer
of
all
times
but
this
one
comes
across
with
a
fantastic
mix
of
sweet
malt
bread
and
grain
to
make
an
exceptional
beer
overall
this
one
was
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
smells
quite
nice
but
i
dont
think
id
look
this
way
again
if
i
want
a
brown
o
for
a
random
single
this
provided
loads
of
flavour
and
was
definitely
fitting
of
the
style
a
true
sessionable
brown
ale
that
packs
a
little
extra
abv
that
goes
completely
undetected
well
worth
a
try
a
tasty
ale
indeed
i
was
surprised
at
how
dark
this
poured
out
of
the
bottle
head
was
minimal
initial
nose
was
malty
indicating
that
this
wouldnt
be
some
newcastle
knockoff
indeed
this
thing
is
full
of
delicious
malt
its
well
balanced
with
its
hops
and
very
drinkable
th
final
is
just
like
the
start
malty
all
in
all
a
surprisingly
good
beer
will
bring
a
couple
more
six
packs
home
when
im
in
mn
o
i
might
have
a
new
favorite
beer
very
approachable
dark
beer
something
you
could
have
at
the
end
of
dinner
for
dessert
or
in
the
afternoon
sitting
in
the
sun
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no
bottle
dating
pours
with
instant
head
that
takes
forever
to
settle
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
very
dense
2
finger
off
white
head
with
insane
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
nice
thick
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
streaming
up
this
is
probably
infected
aromas
of
huge
apple
skins
caramel
molasses
toasted
malt
bread
light
chocolate
and
light
herbal
hops
way
over
the
top
apple
notes
makes
finding
anything
else
difficult
taste
of
chocolate
caramel
biscuit
toast
nuttiness
brown
sugar
light
herbal
hops
and
light
fruitiness
no
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
chocolate
biscuit
caramel
toast
nuttiness
and
light
herbal
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
good
balance
of
malty
flavors
with
no
cloying
sweetness
low
noticeable
infection
traits
in
the
flavor
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
after
the
finish
noticed
overall
despite
the
obvious
infection
this
was
still
a
pretty
tasty
brown
ale
good
balance
of
some
pretty
robust
flavors
and
quite
easy
to
drink
i
am
sure
this
is
a
great
beer
without
bugs
in
it
unique
well
crafted
example
of
the
style
overall
i
liked
the
nose
the
best
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
dropped
off
a
bit
very
average
o
happy
with
this
one
great
blend
and
nice
new
flavors
a
good
pour
from
brau
bros
pours
a
dull
brown
with
no
head
whatsoever
some
dots
of
lace
strewn
about
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
toasted
oak
biscuit
malt
and
nuts
this
is
a
malt
bomb
with
subtle
earthy
notes
from
the
fuggles
on
the
palate
the
same
notes
come
through
only
with
some
cocoa
powder
and
berries
the
feel
is
thin
light
body
with
mild
carbonation
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
this
is
a
tame
take
on
the
style
but
good
nonetheless
nuts
and
toasted
oak
linger
with
a
mild
berry
sweetness
this
is
definitely
one
i
wouldnt
turn
away
if
given
the
opportunity
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
o
this
is
a
nice
english
brown
ale
a
solid
brew
from
brau
brothers
dr
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
almost
refreshing
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
on
nitro
if
its
available
the
cream
in
particular
is
lovely
hides
its
abv
well
give
her
a
spin
especially
if
youre
fond
of
brown
ales
the
beer
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
few
centimeters
of
smallbuble
creamy
sticky
foam
the
aroma
has
a
distinct
earthy
and
nutty
characteristic
with
some
bitter
chocolate
lingering
in
the
background
this
theme
continues
to
play
out
on
the
palate
the
medium
to
full
body
of
the
beer
has
a
creamy
texture
but
retains
a
bite
through
a
pleasing
level
of
carbonation
the
faint
kick
of
hops
at
the
end
is
a
welcome
counter
point
to
the
roasted
malt
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
wow
what
a
pleasant
brown
ale
very
full
tasting
a
great
fall
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
o
a
wellmade
tasty
brown
ale
so
far
its
my
recommendation
from
brau
brothers
overall
an
enjoyable
english
brown
ale
id
buy
it
if
it
was
available
locally
the
taste
starts
with
sweet
malts
caramel
and
toffee
with
quite
a
bit
of
nuts
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
as
well
mouth
is
fairly
thin
12
oz
bottle
aroma
is
malty
caramel
slight
chocolate
cake
notes
slightly
roasted
not
much
hops
here
but
very
fiantly
detectable
with
light
grassy
notes
appearance
is
a
muddy
brown
with
a
medium
to
low
tan
head
that
diminishes
into
a
soapy
film
taste
is
sweet
malts
with
a
slight
graininess
lightly
bitter
and
more
of
the
chocolate
and
caramel
note
coming
out
in
the
backing
palate
is
medium
bodies
creamy
and
slightly
thick
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
overall
nice
offering
as
a
brown
ale
i
would
drink
this
agian
cheers
overall
i
am
very
partial
to
brown
ales
but
this
one
wasnt
nearly
what
i
was
hoping
for
or
expecting
there
is
certainly
a
nice
brown
ale
base
but
it
just
kind
of
goes
downhill
from
there
i
am
willing
to
give
this
one
another
go
sometime
down
the
road
because
i
usually
enjoy
brau
brothers
offerings
but
for
now
ill
have
to
call
it
a
disappointment
overall
a
well
made
beer
if
not
my
favorite
style
d
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
the
flavors
tend
to
build
a
bit
on
the
palate
but
it
is
unique
and
tasty
drinkability
malty
flavorful
sweet
and
smooth
a
good
malty
brown
ale
to
session
with
the
dark
fruit
flavors
are
nice
as
well
this
is
a
good
one
from
brau
brothers
brewing
my
pour
resulted
in
a
finger
of
dense
mediumtan
head
with
reasonable
retention
on
a
humid
evening
color
was
a
deep
garnetrubyred
with
nequality
clarity
i
am
in
love
nose
was
very
malty
more
truth
in
advertising
the
biscuit
malt
was
definitely
in
the
forefront
but
with
pecan
undertones
i
thought
of
lazy
magnolias
pecan
beer
for
a
moment
mouthfeel
was
medium
approaching
creaminess
with
the
chocolateraspberry
flavors
the
immediate
senses
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
nuttiness
that
i
had
not
achieved
earlier
wow
not
to
be
sexist
but
this
might
have
been
the
night
to
have
capt
midnite
a
counterperson
at
my
local
minimart
who
often
gets
to
close
at
0000
over
for
a
drink
man
but
this
was
super
sweet
and
certainly
a
dessert
beer
chicks
seem
to
dig
this
sort
of
thing
finish
had
a
melange
of
nuttiness
and
raspberry
but
the
chocolate
seemed
to
fade
initially
before
making
a
reappearance
on
the
extreme
finish
hoo
i
may
need
some
insulin
after
all
of
this
sugar
it
was
wild
and
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
my
earlier
experiment
but
i
would
not
want
a
steady
diet
thereof
m
nice
carbonation
very
drinkable
despite
the
fruit
sweetness
its
not
cloying
very
refreshing
on
an
unseasonably
warm
day
in
early
april
compliments
watching
the
final
round
of
the
masters
quite
well
taste
is
pretty
simplistic
in
its
maltiness
but
what
is
there
is
extremely
deliciouss
cocoa
kripies
keep
coming
to
mind
as
it
is
very
smooth
and
chocolaty
i
could
easily
sit
down
and
drink
2
or
3
pints
of
this
in
a
row
no
problem
my
first
brau
brothers
beer
has
impressed
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
overall
a
quality
example
of
a
brown
ale
with
great
nutty
smelltaste
and
a
balanced
load
of
chocolate
supporting
flavors
will
definitely
drink
again
wellhidden
abv
at

80
as
alcohol
does
not
come
through
on
taste
finish
grass
notes
hover
with
a
very
small
about
of
hops
in
the
background
d
well
done
brown
ale
and
well
hidden
abv
the
aroma
invites
with
a
variety
of
flavors
on
the
nose
from
fruitlike
cherry
to
more
bourbony
and
rich
like
caramel
or
coffee
the
taste
feels
like
there
is
more
going
on
than
most
browns
almost
like
a
triple
d
awesome
could
session
in
nearly
any
circumstance
a
good
beer
a
little
thin
but
a
good
quaff
malt
comes
through
nicely
as
it
warms
skål
o
brau
bros
consistently
puts
out
quality
product
but
rarely
transcendent
this
one
fits
the
mold
malty
and
sweet
but
the
earthy
and
woody
qualities
bring
some
balance
not
bad
easy
to
drink
solid
english
brown
d
yeah
it
was
not
the
greatest
beer
but
i
found
it
hard
to
criticize
i
dont
think
it
was
overly
drinkable
d
i
like
this
pretty
solid
brown
ale
so
far
best
beer
from
the
sampler
d
this
beverage
is
one
of
my
favorites
normally
the
browns
are
fall
beverages
but
this
one
is
good
anytime
of
the
year
by
far
brau
brothers
finest
offering
an
american
brown
aleenglish
not
bloody
likely
that
is
quite
possibly
one
of
the
top
browns
ive
enjoyed
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
in
quite
a
long
time
right
up
there
with
new
glarus
fat
squirrel
surly
bender
and
rogue
hazelnut
overall
this
is
decent
drinkable
but
mostly
average
d
a
nice
offering
from
brau
bros
alcoholy
but
pleasant
and
nice
for
sipping
md
medium
to
lighter
body
lighter
carbonation
fairly
smooth
feel
as
it
rolls
around
the
tongue
drinkability
is
not
the
greatest
i
grow
tired
of
this
pretty
quick
too
much
fake
chocolaty
and
fruity
flavoring
an
interesting
twist
on
an
englishstyle
brown
according
to
label
fuggles
hops
used
it
is
an
englishstyle
brown
with
a
tart
raspberry
undertone
and
is
higher
in
alcohol
that
shows
somewhat
than
is
typical
its
a
creative
take
on
a
traditional
style
nice
d
wonderful
tasty
and
damn
drinkable
did
not
even
know
this
brewer
existed
its
a
win
for
me
and
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
malty
brews
probably
ties
the
whirly
bird
as
my
favorate
brau
beer
purchased
at
blue
max
liquors
in
burnsville
mn
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
body
with
an
off
white
head
that
caps
the
beer
aroma
of
milk
chocolate
toasted
bread
and
nutty
toffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
flavors
of
chocolate
covered
dried
cherries
first
greet
you
then
transition
to
a
smooth
and
sweet
finish
great
drinkability
i
happened
across
this
at
a
beer
tasting
event
for
3m
i
had
never
heard
of
the
brau
bros
and
even
at
the
end
of
the
night
12
breweries
60
labels
many
samples
this
one
stuck
out
as
the
clear
best
while
the
rest
just
faded
together
i
knew
that
i
had
to
try
this
one
again
with
a
clear
head
and
it
turned
out
even
better
for
the
price
and
the
quality

this
is
likely
to
become
my
fridge
beer
of
choice
who
says
you
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
england
for
a
good
nut
brown
nice
solid
brown
ale
makes
for
a
nice
cool
weather
beer
if
the
earthiness
was
a
bit
toned
down
this
would
be
even
better
i
will
have
this
again
drinkability
both
full
flavored
and
easy
drinking
at
the
same
time
maybe
the
best
english
brown
ale
i
have
had
i
suppose
that
i
should
try
this
fresh
because
it
touts
autumn
hunting
season
in
sw
mn
the
mouthfeel
is
firm
a
little
creamy
but
slightly
harsh
with
carbonation
as
of
this
bottle
im
not
impressed
yet
again
with
bbb
but
im
willing
to
accede
that
this
is
close
to
an
interesting
take
on
the
english
brown
style
a
good
offering
from
brau
brothers
its
full
of
flavor
and
smooth
for
a
6
8
abv
a
little
more
body
may
have
been
nice
but
thats
not
to
take
away
from
a
good
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
english
brown
ale
i
havent
had
an
english
brown
in
awhile
and
it
was
nice
to
revisit
the
style
this
brew
is
very
sweet
and
has
a
strong
flavor
it
would
be
perfect
for
making
bread
with
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
da
drinkable
brew
enjoyable
to
enjoy
on
occassion
as
the
sweetness
of
the
toffeecaramelly
malt
can
become
a
bit
much
d
goes
down
nice
and
easy
my
first
sampling
of
brau
bros
which
i
know
is
a
shame
as
i
live
in
minneapolis
but
wow
there
couldnt
be
a
better
beer
to
start
with
i
am
impressed
i
will
be
looking
for
more
from
the
brau
bro
d
good
drinkability
id
certainly
reach
for
another
one
if
i
had
it
available
ring
neck
braun
shows
that
brau
brothers
can
brew
good
beer
if
they
put
their
minds
to
it
their
standard
lineup
borders
on
awful
at
times
but
this
first
offering
in
the
single
batch
series
is
something
to
celebrate

the
best
offering
i

had
from
brau

i
would
definately
have
this
one
again
the

drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
beer
it
is
a
shame
this
is
party
of
their

series
i
wouldnt
mind
adding
this
to
my
regular
line
up
in
the
fridge
grab
it
if
you
can
but
quite
good
as
an
autumnal
seasonal
not
bad
at
all
i
can
feel
the
warmth
already
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
versatile
i
e
with
food
or
stand
alone
this
one

this
pours
a
clear
dark

color
the
smell
is
sweet
and
nutty
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nutty
caramel
flavor
with
minimal
hops
theres
nothing
overly
complicated
about
this
beerit
just
tastes
good
in
the
style
of
an
english
brown
ale
the

is
smooth

drinkable

flavor
starts
with

very
good
all
around

this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
was
going
to
save
the
remaining
two
for
another
night
but
they
are
going
down
the
hatch
tonight
to
me
that
is
drinkability
when
you
cant
wait
to
drink
it
again
my
overall
score
may
seem
high
but
to
me
this
is
a
dandy
i
wish
i
could
buy
more
about
the
only
drawback
is
the
yeasty
aroma
i
noted
and
which
is
evident
in
most
of
the
beers
i
have
tried
in
this
one
it
blends
with
things
nicer
and
does
not
bother
me
as
much
as
say
in
their
pilsner
or
pale
ale
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
ruby
hues
around
the
edges
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
strong
caramel
nuts
toffee
a
hint
of
butter
the
taste
is
as
bold
as
the
aroma
caramel
and
toffee
round
dominate
the
flavor
with
a
slight
yeasty
note
that
seems
to
be
common
to
brau
brothers
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
i
would
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
and
can
only
hope
it
is
brewed
again
someday
the
chocolate
malt
really
comes
through
with
some
nuttiness
and
nice
hop
bitterness
to
balance
everything
out
i
would
say
it
is
medium
bodied
but
the
fizzyness
of
the
carbonation
makes
it
seem
lighter
this
is
a
really
good
beer
just
needs
to
be
more
active
on
pour
with
better
head
retention
overall
the
only
other
brau
bros
beer
i
have
tried
was
their
strawberry
wheat
and
i
tell
you
what
this
one
was
much
more
impressive
billed
as
a
double
nut
brown
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
big
beer
more
like
a
strong
brown
i
really
liked
how
they
brought
out
the
chocolaty
and
nutty
flavors
together
i
will
probably
have
to
grab
another
6er
or
two
before
this
single
batch
is
gone

fairly
biscuity
malt
characteristics
esp
chocolate
malt
are
nicely
expressed
theres
even
some
tannins
here
and
of
course
a
touch
of
diacetyl
that
works
for
the
style
as
with
several
of
the
ales
in
the
brau
lineup
ring
neck
braun
is
a
touch
grainy
chewy
and
with
an
agreeable
bready
characteristic
oaty
oilyunctious
in
the
best
way
and
fairly
fruity
with
notes
of
berry
and
plum
although
this
one
is
truly
maltfocused
and
rich
it
is
also
fairly
amply
hopped
to
balance
out
its
malt
sweetness
quite
drinkable
and
altogether
fairly
weighty
after
a
couple
of
pints
i
didnt
feel
like
switching
to
another
brew
but
almost
felt
like
tackling
a
hoppier
beast
or
for
that
matter
some
food
this
one
seems
to
just
beg
for
a
pairing
with
something
in
the
rich
and
meaty
category
finish
leans
toward
the
dry
side
and
the
malt
character
really
lingers
ring
neck
braun
ale
is
described
by
brewer
dustin
brau
as
a
double
nut
brown
ale
and
in
that
sense
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
an
imperial
nut
brown
ale
i
enjoyed
earlier
this
year
edit
tommyknocker
and
although
it
doesnt
reach
such
boozy
heights
it
is
still
onstyle
despite
its
strength
rather
impressive
overall
and
i
look
forward
to
repeat
visits

some
faint

some

the
flavors
are
all
pretty
subtle

artfully
constructed

with
mild

this
entire

exhibits
great
balance
with
the
moderate

pleasant

gentle
flavors
this
would
make
a
spectacular
session
beer
i
am
typically
not
a
fan
of
the
brown
ales
that
ive
sampled
from
throughout
the
united
states
but
this
one
got
my
attention
simple
tasty
and
uncontroversial
many
american
browns
have
gone
too
far
with
the
hops
and
in
my
humble
opinion
it
takes
away
from
what
makes
them
delicious
its
good
to
see
another
east
coast
brewery
that
puts
the
carolinas
on
the
map
unsure
of
age
but
know
it
was
bottled
this
year
nutty

toasted
brown

flavor
is
fairly
sweet
and
underattenuated
with
toasted
nutty
malt
dominating
finishing
sugary
sweet
but
then
countered
by
hop
bitterness
which
borders
on
piney
there
are
light
chocolatey
notes
that
make
me
think
this
would
go
very
well
with
a
peanut
butter

clean
giving
just
a
bit
of
dryness
to
counter
the
sweet
while
maintaining
a
firm
crispness
and
being
quite
smooth
not
a
bad
brown
ale
overall
it
grew
on
me
a
bit
as
it
went
down
o
nothing
overly
spectacular
here
but
its
definitely
drinkable
worth
a
look
this
beer
is
what
turned
me
over
to
stouts
while
it
isnt
a
stout
its
just
dark
enough
to
get
you
interested
in
darker
beers
at
least
that
was
the
case
with
me
i
have
found
that
this
is
a
good
middle
ground
beer
for
my
friends
and
me
they
like
light
beer
while
i
drink
stouts
now
bad

is
so
yummy
i
dont
see
why
anyone
wouldnt
like
it

the

it

some
getting
in

up

with
an
overall
roasted

remains

characteristics
build
towards

and
are
joined
by
a

the

the

that
provides
a
clean
and
dry
finale
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
it
looks
awesome
the
smell
is
uninviting
and
the
flavor
eventually
becomes
offensive
i
suspect
this
bottle
is
past
its
prime
so
i
will
stay
open
minded
i
think
this
one
deserves
an
asterisk
overall
nothing
special
but
its
enjoyable
not
bad
anyway
its
worth
a
visit
to
check
out
the
brewery
if
youve
never
had
their
beers
but
imho
theres
too
many
other
good
breweries
in
nc
that
i
would
try
first
o
not
a
fan
of
this
at
all
i
think
there
is
a
process
problem
maybe
a
very
high
fermentation
temp
to
get
that
nose
o
delicious
nothing
earthshattering
and
not
going
to
win
a
hype
contest
but
just
a
good
all
around
beer
to
sit
down
and
relax
with
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
not
really
anything
special
i
would
have
appreciated
a
little
more
aroma
to
the
beer
another
brew
found
at
margauxs
restaurant
in
raleigh
nc
this
one
shows
a
dark
brown
mahogany
color
nearly
opaque
the
head
is
a
modest
offwhite
cover
with
respectable
lacing
the
aroma
brings
pretty
standard
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
burnt
wood
ash
mild
but
pleasant
enough
the
first
mouthful
delivers
a
somewhat
diluted
brown
bread
maltcharcoal
medley
well
blended
but
kind
of
watery
without
being
unlikeable
there
is
a
bit
of
tart
swampy
hop
going
on
here
sort
of
cider
like
maybe
but
the
roasted
malt
charcoal
lead
the
way
on
flavor
as
i
get
used
to
this
i
pick
up
some
honey
sweetness
and
leafy
edges
this
brown
ale
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
subtle
tingly
carbonation
and
somewhat
aqueous
feel
not
bad
at
all
a
little
weak
for
my
tastes
but
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
deep
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
were
moderate
but
nothing
too
exciting
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
of
some
nice
roasted
malt
aromas
with
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
nose
as
well
there
is
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
nuts
on
the
nose
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
toasted
its
got
a
decent
dry
bitterness
to
it
in
the
finish
also
there
are
subtle
elements
of
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
pretty
standard
nothing
too
crazy
going
on
overall
its
a
good
drinkable
beer
a
little
more
bite
than
say
newcastle
but
still
a
good
craft
beer
o
bad
penny
isnt
outstanding
by
any
stretch
of
the
word
but
damn
if
it
isnt
sessionable
and
smooth
this
beer
is
unlike
the
label
a
rather
plain
jane
which
will
definitely
satisfy
in
the
autumn
months
overall
i
like
worty
so
its
ok
by
me
but
certainly
not
the
classic
example
of
a
brown
ale
nice
balance
easy
to
drink
and
savory
enough
to
enjoy
one
or
more
o
i
was
surprised
at
how
flavorful
this
beer
was
i
came
in
expecting
boring
and
i

poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutty
and
powdered
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
powdered
chocolate
dark
chocolate
and
nutty
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
i
really
liked
the
chocolate
aspect
to
this
one
that
came
across
in
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
the
aroma
was
quite
pleasant
on
this
one
but
the
flavor
just
fell
a
little
short
a
solid
brew
that
i
would
drink
again
and
if
you
havent
i
suggest
you
do
bolder
than
most
other
brown
ales
ive
had
without
taking
on
the
qualities
of
a
porter
or
stout
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
my
last
beer
of
2011
a
little
disappointing
with
the
pour
very
small
off
whitetan
head
that
faded
quick
and
left
no
traces
smell
was
very
underwhelming
some
nutty
malts
and
a
small
bit
of
chocolate
taste
is
where
this
picked
up
a
bit
something
about
the
coffeechocolate
stout
characteristics
mixed
with
the
nuttycarmel
brown
hit
the
spot
on
this
one
a
pretty
complex
taste
which
made
it
hard
to
sit
down
not
too
schooled
on
the
ebas
and
perhaps
that
is
where
the
stout
qualities
come
in
but
this
was
very
smooth
and
full
flavored
feel
was
decent
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
stout
like
silk
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
tastes
better
than
it
looks
and
smells
complex
and
rich
i
will
be
hitting
another
one
soon
theres
a
solid
chocolate
undertone
to
it
with
a
nutty
overall
taste
definitely
a
stout
the
taste
is
mild
but
theres
something
refreshing
about
it
it
has
a
carbonated
tingly
feel
theres
a
zestyness
there
that
some
stouts
lack
its
good
if
not
forgettable
the
beer
is
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
beige
cap
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
offering
subtle
hints
of
bready
malts
biscuits
fruit
light
bodied
with
moderately
low
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
generally
unexciting
some
toffee
and
caramel
notes
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
over
all
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
local
brewery
doing
a
great
job
and
it
may
change
until
they
feel
the
brew
is
right
but
right
now
big
boss
is
doing
just
fine
drinkability
is
ok
its
a
pretty
full
flavored
brown
ale
a
bit
heavy
for
my
taste
in
the
style
especially
when
the
abv
doesnt
really
match
bad
pennys
one
of
my
goto
favorites
the
beer
pours
dark
chocolate
brown
with
very
little
head
and
has
a
malty
aroma
that
smells
like
chocolate
with
a
slightly
nutty
undertone
the
taste
yields
the
same
and
it
proves
to
be
a
very
malty
beer
which
is
exactly
what
i
like
in
my
browns
all
in
all
a
great
beer
to
try
on
tap
or
from
the
bottle
its
my
favorite
of
the
big
boss
offerings
kudos
to
big
boss
brewing
for
marking
the
bottled
date
a
vigorous
poor
from
the
bottle
straight
down
the
middle
of
the
glass
yielded
a
pitiful
halffinger
wide
head
atop
a
dark
brown
liquid
the
large
bubbles
that
composed
the
head
faded
within
a
minute
and
left
no
lacing
not
a
very
appealing
start
the
smell
was
an
improvement
over
the
appearance
with
a
pleasant
combination
of
caramel
nuts
and
citrus
the
taste
is
wellbalanced
between
malt
and
hops
im
picking
up
some
chocolate
nuts
and
some
fruity
earthiness
hops
are
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
a
good
tasting
beer
just
close
your
eyes
when
drinking
not
bad
but
could
use
a
little
more
body
in
my
opinion
overall
a
drinkable
beverage
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
this
isnt
even
a
particular
favorite
style
of
mine
but
i
would
have
many
others
over
this
thing
in
this
style
by
a
country
mile
aka
dookieball
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
worth
seeking
out
easy
going
down
and
has
all
the
requirement
for
a
good
brown
overall
definitely
a
good
tasting
brew
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
nice
lingering
aftertaste
just
right
for
the
brown
ale
category
had
this
at
fuel
pizza
in
charlotte
a
brown
color
obviously
not
a
great
head
on
the
pour
i
was
actually
tilting
the
bottle
straight
up
in
down
to
try
and
get
one
not
much
of
a
smell
from
what
i
could
get
out
of
it
carmelly
it
does
have
the
taste
of
coffee
and
chocolate
probably
the
combination
from
a
chocolate
malt
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
the
carbonation
was
fine
and
so
the
mouthfeel
nothing
specatular
nothing
bad
just
average
the
best
thing
was
the
drinkability
it
could
have
more
of
these
if
i
had
my
choice
of
brown
beers
at
the
store
i
would
probably
choose
something
else
but
this
does
well
in
a
pinch
when
there
isnt
much
of
a
selection
i
should
note
that
this
bottle
was
dated
july
2010
so
i
will
be
interested
to
try
a
fresher
sample
to
see
if
my
impression
changes
at
all
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
di
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
because
i
just
didnt
like
the
beer
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not

me

cant
understand
anyone
grading
this
beer
below
an
a
the
smell
and
the
taste
is
just
threw
the
roof
i
have
already
hooked
4
other
people
on
this
beer
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
have
had
on
tap
and
then
found
in
a
bottle
that
was
even
close
to
its
draft
flavor
this
has
become
my
new
favorite
the
only
issue
so
far
is
i
cant
drink
less
than
3
of
these
in
a
session
and
this
is
truley
a
session
beer
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
tasting
brown
ales
out
there
im
glad
i
grabbed
it
at
bruisin
ales
in
asheville
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
and
light
carb
give
a
creamy
finish
drinkability
was
nice
i
would
try
this
again
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
a
very
drinkable
brown
that
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
beer
i
would
make
a
regular
in
my
cooler
oooo
weee
d
while
not
offensive
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
for
it
flavors
are
just
to
weak
i
wont
mind
finishing
the
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
track
this
down
personally
not
very
drinkable
for
me
too
many
good
beers
out
there
to
settle
for
this
one
consumed
on2242010
d
super
easy
drinking
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
a
nice
session
beer
thanks
for
the
opportunity
overall
we
find
that
this
is
an
average
to
good
beer
reasonably
priced
and
worth
drinking
from
time
to
time
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
was
lucky
to
have
experienced
its
malty
deliciosness
on
tap
when
i
ordered
the
server
asked
if
i
liked
newcastle
which
i
do
but
this
beer
is
much
better
the
only
similarity
is
their
style
she
brought
out
my
pint
and
i
had
to
first
notice
the
dark
color
and
limited
head
the
flavor
is
what
blew
me
away
it
is
technically
an
english
brown
but
it
tasted
very
american
i
say
that
because
of
the
intense
roasted
malt
flavor
and
hearty
feel
this
isnt
a
thick
beer
but
it
was
definitely
heartier
than
a
typical
brown
i
loved
it
overall
not
bad
pours
with
minimal
head
light
cream
tan
color
the
foam
wasnt
there
long
enough
to
really
be
able
to
leave
any
lacing
behind
hazy
reddish
brown
almost
mudlike
has
a
more
metallic
red
hue
around
the
rims
admits
a
bit
of
light
the
nose
is
almost
completely
chocolate
actually
smells
like
a
german
chocolate
cake
caramel
pudding
whipped
cream
touch
of
roasted
chestnuts
minimal
if
any
fruit
citrus
scents
any
hopsbased
elements
hiding
better
than
alqueda
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
semisluggish
and
doesnt
add
texture
as
the
weight
is
shed
swiftly
more
chocolate
caramel
toffee
whipped
cream
molasses
manages
to
come
across
as
sweet
but
not
necessarily
sugary
pinch
of
apricot
and
cherry
fruit
as
well
as
cereals
granola
overall
its
an
innocuous
quaff
hits
your
belly
solidly
especially
if
you
like
a
sweeter
beer
i
dont
know
that
id
purchase
it
again
but
would
easily
down
it
if
handed
one
a
dark
brown
color
with
mahogany
highlighting
around
the
edges
a
thin
cap
of
lace
and
a
rim
around
the
top
but
not
much
head
retention
a
pleasantly
strong
aroma
with
some
roasted
grains
jumping
out
first
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
doesnt
really
seem
to
deliver
what
the
aroma
promised
granted
the
roasted
flavors
are
there
and
in
particular
a
flavor
of
bittersweet
chocolate
but
it
seems
a
little
onedimensional
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
the
feel
is
surprisingly
more
carbonated
than
i
expected
it
had
a
decent
scrubbing
bubbles
thing
going
on
but
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
softer
and
more
coating
than
cleansing
perhaps
that
would
have
allowed
some
more
flavors
to
come
out
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
raleigh
area
its
certainly
drinkable
and
makes
a
decent
session
beer
but
there
are
certainly
nicer
brown
ales
on
the
market
the
lighter
carbonation
on
this
helps
add
to
an
already
smooth
mouthfeel
and
aids
in
making
this
brew
incredibly
easy
to
drink
very
nice
and
flavorful
without
going
overboard
with
any
of
the
individual
components
very
nice
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
flavorful
english
browns
or
any
brown
for
that
matter
i
can
remember
having
definitely
worth
a
shot
medium
to
light
body
enjoyable
aftertaste
with
this
brown
ale
would
prefer
over
a
newcastle
my
favorite
beer
prior
to
entering
the
craft
beer
hobby
great
drink
during
a
cool
summer
night
with
friends
bad
penny
the
woman
may
have
a
tarnished
reputation
but
purchasing
bad
penny
the
beer
makes
a
lot
of
cents
for
those
who
appreciate
a
finely
crafted
english
brown
for
my
money
bad
penny
is
definitely
good
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
out
of
this
brew
but
im
happy
with
what
i
got
this
is
my
second
brew
from
big
boss
and
an
enjoyable
one
at
that
thanks
for
the
bottle
rusty
i
will
definitely
have
another
go
at
this
one
to
give
it
a
fair
shakemy
bottle
is
less
than
amonth
old
but
maybe
one
of
us
is
having
an
off
night
i
always
say
i
dont
like
brown
ales
and
then
i
realize
ive
had
a
lot
of
really
good
ones
bad
penny
included
oddly
enough
i
got
this
inside
a
sixpack
of
hells
bellesomeone
had
either
mixed
it
up
or
done
an
opposite
switcheroo
with
a
6
of
bad
penny
turns
out
i
like
bad
penny
better
than
hells
belle
a
cool
surprise
definitely
check
it
out
if
your
down
with
the
brown
the
mouthfeel
has
a
drop
of
metallic
coppery
taste
to
it
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
starting
off
only
to
dry
out
in
the
finish
altogether
this
brew
is
sweet
and
polished
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
want
another
a
damn
fine
beer
da
nice
beer
to
pound
back
a
lil
overcarbonation
to
havemore
than
3
because
they
will
fill
you
up
smooth
crisp
and
nice
to
have
as
a
choice
on
tap
12
oz
real
nice
dark
brown
pour
white
bubbly
head
aroma
is
of
heavy
malt
with
some
yellow
raisin
taste
has
some
malt
brown
sugar
raisin
but
is
then
overwhelmed
by
a
cardboard
like
flavor
not
sure
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
some
woody
characteristic
but
it
is
not
good
like
if
you
let
your
mcdonalds
soda
sit
for
a
day
then
try
and
drink
it
mouthfeel
is
ok
with
some
carbonation
might
be
drinkable
if
not
for
this
large
problem
also
i
love
this
beer
from
big
boss
great
beer
a
new
favorite
in
dark
ales
easy
to
drink
for
anyone
who
likes
a
dark
ale
it
tastes
like
beer
that
was
grown
in
the
woods
and
later
mixed
with
some
dark
chocolate
in
a
building
made
of
old
bricks
but
thats
mostly
a
good
thing
oh
and
it
looks
like
a
glass
of
death
its
so
damn
dark
i
love
that
but
it
was
not
too
overcarbonated
for
me
in
fact
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
it
slid
down
my
raspy
throat
surprisingly
easy
overall
a
good
beer
i
normally
dont
care
for
this
style
but
this
was
good
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
sometime
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
very
dark
nearly
black
and
poured
a
tan
head
that
was
quickly
gone
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
the
lacing
was
gone
or
nearly
non
existant
the
taste
was
pleasant
though
and
i
liked
it
it
was
kinda
coffeish
nuttyish
and
i
will
ejoy
again
overall
could
drink
all
day
notes
from
122906
drinkability
very
easy
and
smooth
for
a
brown
ale
d
im
glad
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
the
ale
is
a
solid
brown
ale
that
packs
a
nice
flavor
although
it
starts
creamy
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
over
carbonated
not
sure
i
could
drink
another
one
of
these
fairly
average
brown
ale
and
i
cant
quite
put
a
finger
on
what
went
wrong
nice
drinkable
session
ale
that
id
have
again
but
there
are
better
brown
ales
available
drinkability
is
decent
but
not
anything
special
im
glad
i
have
better
browns
to
choose
from
locally
tastes
wet
sweet
with
drying
woody
and
soured
caramel
tang
nutty
and
thin
yet
bitter
coffee
flavor
not
good
astringent
dry
finish
with
carbonation
acrid
chiming
in
as
an
unpleasant
counterpoint
light
body
and
strong
carbonation
dumper
life
is
too
short
to
drink
lousy
beer
the
drink
is
almost
colalike
thin
and
crisp
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
is
a
very
easy
drinker
not
please
with
this
one
everything
was
slightly
off
but
not
horrible
i
cant
recommend
this
in
good
faith
decent
mouthfeel
was
and
wonderful
appearance
but
those
were
about
the
only
redeeming
qualities
in
this
letdown
the
body
is
moderate
to
light
carbonation
is
light
but
ok
there
is
a
slickness
that
i
usually
associate
with
dms
but
not
really
perceivable
in
the
taste
reminds
me
more
of
a
mild
but
still
pretty
good
on
tap
at
the
restaurant
attached
to
the
souther
season
in
chapel
hill
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
thin
almond
colored
head
atopmuted
aromas
of
dark
roast
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
mainly
pretty
standard
for
the
style
on
the
palatesomwehat
sweet
up
front
with
bitter
chocolate
flavors
with
pretty
hefty
roasted
coffeelike
base
underneath
thru
to
the
finish
not
bad
but
like
i
said
pretty
basic
stuff
here
overall
a
bit
watery
on
the
end
what
i
call
the
american
curse
much
like
a
cold
irish
coffee
rather
dark
for
a
brown
ale
almost
a
light
porter
nice
work
really
brown
ales
are
not
usually
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
could
session
this
one
all
day
long
every
day
this
is
a
mighty
fine
brown
ale
and
i
cant
believe
it
does
not
get
better
scores
if
anyone
ever
wants
to
send
me
more
of
this
feel
free
probably
not
for
everyone
its
certainly
less
practical
then
say
a
newcastle
brown
but
fans
of
the
style
will
enjoy
this
one
well
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
this
style
nothing
spectacular
and
like
last
few
reviews
said
no
one
will
probably
rate
this
particularly
high
but
a
very
nice
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
one
all
the
time
all
night
excellent
little
session
brew
this
is
one
of
the
session
brews
that
everyone
wants
but
then
they
dont
review
well
bull
shit
this
is
a
great
american
brown
id
take
it
over
the
mass
produced
browns
any
day
it
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
big
offwhite
head
quickly
dissolved
to
a
small
ring
that
stuck
around
smelled
of
sweet
malty
goodness
with
a
hint
of
toasty
nuttiness
tasted
like
a
typical
brown
ale
big
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
minimal
nutty
taste
and
very
small
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
silky
and
added
a
lot
to
the
overall
experience
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
as
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
this
wasnt
a
bad
brown
ale
form
big
boss
but
nothing
seemed
to
really
jump
out
at
you
it
went
down
easy
enough
though
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
tan
head
is
medium
sized
and
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
surface
aroma
is
faint
chocolate
with
some
toastiness
roaste
malt
dominates
light
coffee
notes
little
sweetness
some
light
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
pretty
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
from
this
small
carolina
brewery
single
bottle
from
whole
foods
raleigh
notched
as
bottled
in
december
2007
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
not
the
best
brown
ale
out
there
but
when
in
the
triangle
drink
local
beers
alcohol
is
slightly
too
high
5
5
to
be
a
session
beer
but
i
could
easily
have
several
with
a
pizza
recommended
a
good
pretty
interesting
brown
wouldnt
mind
trying
some
more
from
them
thanks
again
limesmut
very
dark
brown
with
caramel
and
crimson
highlights
the
beige
head
drops
quickly
but
its
got
one
of
those
creamy
bubbly
caps
that
i
love
freshly
crushed
maltiness
in
the
aroma
hints
of
creamy
chocolate
and
nuts
with
a
certain
earthiness
all
around
the
flavor
is
malty
in
a
creamy
sort
of
way
nutty
lightly
sweet
and
chocolaty
easy
going
medium
body
makes
it
nice
and
drinkable
this
is
nothing
overthetop
its
a
well
constructed
session
beer
overall
a
nice
session
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
md
pretty
high
amount
of
carbonation
kind
of
throws
it
off
but
ive
heard
others
complain
of
lack
of
carbonation
so
they
may
still
be
working
some
kinks
out
of
the
bottling
line
boby
is
mediumfull
and
drinkability
is
fine
this
beer
was
formerly
known
as
uncle
nuts
brown
ale
and
it
could
easily
be
found
in
bottles
in
many
groceries
and
beer
bars
i
had
it
on
tap
this
evening
at
horniblows
tavern
in
raleigh
it
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
and
the
color
was
expected
nut
brown
the
tan
head
was
shortlived
a
thin
lacing
was
left
after
a
few
moments
the
aroma
wasnt
very
strong
but
hints
of
toasted
malts
caramel
and
a
bit
of
hops
can
be
detected
the
flavor
is
on
the
mild
side
but
it
certainly
comes
across
as
a
decentif
not
specialenglish
brown
ale
it
is
a
little
heavily
carbonated
for
my
taste
and
it
is
mediumbodied
i
suppose
i
prefer
brown
ales
with
a
heavier
mouthfeel
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
may
choose
something
else
if
other
brown
ales
are
available
the
taste
is
a
bit
bland
with
some
toffeecaramel
malts
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
really
not
much
else
even
once
my
food
arrived
the
flavor
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
as
for
mouthfeel
its
a
bit
thin
and
watery
with
a
low
carbonation
level
and
an
okay
finish
it
is
refreshing
however
and
quite
easy
to
drink
ill
probably
try
this
again
sometime
and
hopefully
itll
impress
me
more
than
it
did
today
the
first
miss
of
the
normally
delicious
big
boss
beers
ive
tried
flavor
was
quite
good
this
would
be
a
good
beer
o
cook
with
not
overthetop
malty
but
with
a
slight
hop
presenc
balancing
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
within
the
malts
there
was
a
strong
presence
of
candied
hazelnuts
and
chestnuts
even
some
slight
hints
of
spices
this
would
make
a
nice
winterchristmas
beer
medium
mouth
body
which
was
nice
because
it
was
not
particularly
filling
woul
definitely
order
again
formerly
known
as
edentons
uncle
nut
this
will
be
one
of
four
beers
to
be
bottled
year
round
by
big
boss
the
beer
was
served
a
decent
crisp
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
diminished
to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
of
dark
malts
with
some
undertoned
pine
hops
the
taste
was
well
balanced
with
a
slight
nut
texture
the
beer
was
light
and
crisp
an
enjoyable
brown
ale
nice
and
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
over
the
summer
but
my
palate
in
changing
for
the
better
heck
id
recommend
this
to
someone
if
the
other
options
were
wither
unknown
or
terrible
its
worth
a
drink
i
suppose
serving
type
bottle
pours
to
a
permanent
head
that
laces
well
aroma
is
brown
crystal
and
chocolate
malts
with
nutty
roasty
notes
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
nice
balancing
lowimpact
hop
bitterness
that
is
distinctly
english
dry
crisp
nutty
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
co2
is
on
the
high
side
for
style
overall
a
pleasing
brown
a
fair
though
unexciting
brown
ale
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
appear
on
the
weak
side
of
things
and
lacks
a
certain
oomph
as
far
as
overall
impact
the
beer
doesnt
fail
as
far
as
coming
across
as
a
brown
ale
just
lacks
depth
and
distinction
i
was
heavyhanded
in
my
pour
until
i
realized
that
this
one
held
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
i
had
to
back
down
fairly
quickly
i
still
got
a
pseudocascade
which
settled
into
two
fingers
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
lighter
shade
of
brown
than
in
the
messiah
srm
17

but
with
nequality
clarity
and
copper
highlights
nose
had
a
distinct
cocoa
powder
quality
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
fairly
sweet
like
chocolate
peanut
butter
and
marshmallow
you
might
think
that
i
would
dislike
this
being
a
resident
hophead
but
i
actually
thought
that
this
was
more
aligned
with
the
style
i
liked
it
more
than
i
did
with
messiah
frankly
the
finish
was
relatively
sweet
but
it
is
what
i
expect
in
the
style
it
was
mostly
chocolate
but
i
was
still
getting
a
nuttiness
especially
on
the
extreme
finish
its
pretty
good
beer
poured
a
rich
semiclear
amber
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
quite
nice
looking
very
true
to
style
scents
of
nutty
faint
caramel
and
bready
malt
along
with
a
slight
hint
of
toasted
bread
a
light
and
malty
aroma
true
to
style
but
not
the
best
flavor
begins
moderately
malty
sweet
with
nutty
and
slight
caramel
malt
flavors
balanced
with
a
mediumlow
level
of
bitterness
with
a
low
floral
hop
character
this
moves
into
toasted
malt
flavors
and
some
toffee
along
with
nutty
flavors
balanced
again
by
a
mediumlow
bitterness
finish
is
toasted
and
nutty
malt
flavors
with
the
same
mediumlow
level
of
bitterness
and
some
slight
floral
hop
flavors
offsetting
some
malty
sweetness
aftertaste
is
nutty
and
toasted
malt
with
a
mediumlow
bitterness
a
good
malthop
balance
throughout
malty
sweet
with
a
balance
of
mediumlow
bitterness
not
bad
good
and
true
to
style
but
not
the
best
flavor
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
the
body
is
true
to
style
but
the
light
carbonation
hurts
the
feel
still
nicely
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
english
brown
ale
that
fits
the
style
well
enough
it
just
doesnt
do
enough
to
stand
out
still
a
good
session
ale
and
i
dont
regret
having
it
the
flavors
work
but
are
on
the
faint
side
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
get
excited
about
here
this
is
overall
a
pretty
forgettable
beer
but
one
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
offered
something
good
enough
to
drink
while
doing
other
activities
low
d
o
this
beer
is
quite
malty
but
is
easy
to
drink
because
it
doesnt
have
that
heavy
of
a
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
a
lovely
reddishbrown
color
to
it
there
wasnt
much
head
on
the
pour
and
it
didnt
stick
around
too
long
theres
a
nice
toffee
and
roasted
malt
smell
to
this
beer
theres
a
good
toffeenut
flavor
initially
after
you
let
it
sit
for
a
minute
you
get
a
bit
of
sweetness
out
of
it
the
carbonation
is
nice
on
this
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
lasting
throughout
something
enjoyable
in
the
mouth
o
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
this
was
my
first
santa
fe
brew
a
good
solid
brown
ale
not
too
sweet
or
roasty
but
lacking
a
bit
in
the
mouthfeel
thanks
blueokie
for
the
opportunity
almost
an
excellent
session
beer
o
would
be
much
better
without
the
bitterness
but
thats
what
you
get
in
an
english
nut
brown
overall
a
nice
drinking
beer
thats
a
bit
above
average
always
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
a
new
brewery
o
nothing
special
about
this
brew
beer
is
medium
in
body
nutty
and
tobacco
on
the
palate
an
interesting
beer
with
a
nice
nonbitter
finish
not
the
best
brown
out
there
but
great
on
the
flavor
profile
dark
caramel
brown
in
color
with
a
reddish
hue
and
hazy
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
roasted
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
nuts
and
charred
malt
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
feel
through
the
middle
and
a
tangy
crisp
dry
finish
sweet
roasted
and
toasted
malt
flavors
from
beginning
to
through
the
middle
bitter
hop
flavors
just
before
the
crisp
dry
finish
a
solid
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
with
nice
flavors
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
unfortunately
that
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
poured
a
brownish
amber
body
with
a
thin
14
inch
head
the
head
lasted
fifteen
seconds
and
there
is
no
lacing
of
the
glass
whatsoever
the
taste
is
i
think
unintentionaly
sour
with
notes
of
maybe
alkaseltzer
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
drain
pour
it
was
a
good
beer
overall
just
smooth
and
consistent
wanted
to
bump
it
a
few
of
the
ratings
up
a
bit
but
i
couldnt
pull
the
trigger
a
lighter
very
drinkable
english
brown
pours
a
see
through
weak
coffee
color
thin
in
appearance
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
quick
smells
quite
nutty
hazelnuts
and
even
almonds
in
the
nose
and
taste
flavor
is
rounded
out
by
a
great
roasty
malt
body
with
plenty
of
earthy
characteristics
the
finish
is
on
the
dry
side
with
a
nice
hazelnut
aftertaste
im
not
sure
ive
ever
loved
a
beer
from
santa
fe
brewing
co
but
this
one
is
maybe
as
close
as
ive
gotten
very
light
in
body
and
so
extremely
drinkable
not
too
heavy
for
summer
drinking
affordable
and
a
bit
different
than
most
nut
brown
ale
pours
a
translucent
almost
transparent
brown
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
there
is
a
malty
nutty
smell
not
very
strong
there
is
a
nice
full
taste
a
subtle
malty
flavor
but
a
nice
hazelnut
flavor
not
overpowering
and
rather
easy
to
drink
and
could
easily
go
for
another
overall
i
found
this
very
enjoyable
its
not
overpowering
it
has
a
great
blended
taste
and
the
nut
flavors
fit
very
nicely
overall
drinkability
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
a
fine
and
average
brown
ale
a
medium
brown
tone
with
slight
head
a
very
smooth
and
subtle
flavor
profile
to
this
one
sweet
and
roasty
malts
are
the
emphasis
with
a
touch
of
nuttiness
to
the
flavor
a
creamy
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
very
simple
but
smooth
brown
ale
easily
drinkable
though
not
bold
and
not
very
memorable
oan
easy
to
drink
quick
finishing
brown
ale
with
some
nice
toasted
sweet
character
not
overly
complex
but
a
nice
clean
beer
overall
id
say
this
is
too
mellow
i
like
my
brown
ales
to
be
a
little
more
robust
and
memorable
no
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
just
not
something
to
chase
after
overall
drinkability
the
off
characters
of
this
beer
really
detract
from
this
beers
profile
very
drinkable
but
unremarkable
12oz
bottle
purchased
for
1
50
light
brown
color
short
wispy
head
smells
very
faintly
like
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
equally
faint
weak
malty
but
just
not
much
there
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavor
is
so
lacking
why
bother
ive
noticed
the
bottled
santa
fe
offerings
are
not
as
good
as
the
canned
beers
i
wonder
why
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
malts
leading
the
charge
on
this
one
hints
of
nuts
and
a
touch
of
molasses
as
well
had
me
going
right
away
as
it
warmed
we
then
were
able
to
pick
up
some
notes
of
bready
malts
nice
rush
of
sweet
caramel
and
this
was
quickly
coating
the
inside
of
the
mouth
leaving
everything
with
a
nice
sweet
film
to
it
as
it
passed
the
aftertaste
gave
in
to
much
of
the
nuttiness
that
i
had
been
looking
for
a
nice
vinous
like
bitter
bite
to
it
very
interesting
indeed
some
notes
of
bready
malts
and
grain
in
the
back
and
a
nice
slightly
hopped
and
a
touch
dry
finish
to
it
the
appearance
was
good
i
think
for
a
nut
brown
aleagain
im
a
nube
its
funny
how
different
the
same
beer
can
be
to
everyone
it
difinitely
tells
me
to
always
give
someone
or
something
a
second
chance
my
bottle
poured
a
good
head
and
very
good
lace
i
could
smell
a
maltynuttyfruity
odor
that
also
is
in
the
tastebut
theres
a
bitter
hoppy
taste
that
followed
i
liked
the
fullness
and
bodybut
a
little
too
much
hop
overall
i
would
try
this
again
and
again
the
beer
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
sweet
toffee
with
a
little
bit
of
hazelnuts
or
pecans
mixed
in
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
grass
from
the
hops
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
nuttyness
in
there
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
basic
nut
brown
ale
not
bad
impressive
looks
and
a
good
nose
although
admittedly
weak
but
all
in
all
this
is
only
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
the
beer
came
off
flat
and
a
tad
off
the
mark
in
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
just
not
something
memorable
enough
to
warrant
shelling
out
8

a
six
nice
warming
flavors
of
roasted

small
head
in
the
pint
glass
dark

color
touch
of

actually
does
taste
like
filberts
but
also
a
touch
of
wood
light

note
more
more
bitterness
from
the
grainy
dark
fired
malt
quite
agreeable
quaff
for
summer
on
the
patio
at
cowgirl
in
santa
fe
could
use
more
carbonation
but
is
quite
drinkable
better
than
lots
of
others
in
this
style
o
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
ale
it
seemed
true
to
style
but
the
flavor
profiles
were
really
lacking
not
an
overwhelming
amount
of
flavor
probably
wouldnt
order
again
unless
regs
beers
were
the
only
other
option
good
choice
certainly
seems
brown
enough
for
me
d
this
is
an
ok
if
not
great
english
brown
it
fits
the
style
fairly
well
its
lightness
makes
for
easy
drinking
just
when
i
thought
my
new
mexico
stockpile
was
dry
i
find
two
more
this
one
pours
a
clear
russet
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
light
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
a
nicely
mild
melange
of
flowers
greens
wood
and
walnuts
with
what
i
think
to
be
toffee
hanging
in
the
rafter
waiting
for
the
chance
to
spook
some
ghost
hunters
wannabes
the
taste
tacks
on
a
nice
bit
o
maple
syrup
and
brown
sugar
rounding
things
out
rather
nicely
i
must
say
this
is
some
tasty
nut
brown
goodness
baby
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
very
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
nice
and
tasty
nut
brown
the
best
of
the
nm
bunch
ive
had
so
far
that
marble
reds
got
a
lot
to
live
up
to
i
dont
think
id
put
it
on
tap
at
home
but
id
certainly
love
a
case
of
it
good
drinkability
flavor
etc
d
solid
drinkability
tasty
solid
and
pretty
drinkable
its
a
good
drinker
not
hard
at
all
but
its
not
the
greatest
of
te
style
d
admit
this
is
not
a
favorited
style
pleasing
malty
flavor
but
quite
muted
hops
character
underwhelming
all
that
said
an
easy
drinker
d
wouldnt
rule
out
trying
again
nice
drinking
brown
with
a
solid
complexity
and
a
subtle
english
touch
slightly
hazed
and
reddish
brown
topped
by
a
beige
cap
looks
good
sheets
of
sticky
lace
very
malty
aroma
almost
bocklike
and
not
a
lot
of
depth
taste
was
better
mild
bitterness
with
sweet
caramel
lots
of
malt
and
a
bit
nutty
towards
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
decent
texture
not
too
bad
overall
but
the
malt
character
particularly
in
the
aroma
didnt
work
for
me
taste
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
seems
like
a
hodgepodge
style
of
a
bock
and
an
ale
good
sour
feel
not
much
for
hops
malt
bill
was
a
little
thinner
than
the
appearance
nothing
discernable
changes
downbottle
expensive
for
what
it
is
meh
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
it
reminds
me
of
a
bad
bottle
of
fat
tire
nothing
here
to
recommend
d
this
is
a
solid
nut
brown
ale
it
doesnt
bring
a
potent
hop
bite
but
i
dont
think
this
style
should
it
is
a
very
quaffable
brown
ale
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
im
digging
the
shape
of
the
label
quite
unique
the
brown
ale
appears
a
clear
chestnut
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
medium
toasted
grain
hazelnuts
walnuts
caramelized
malt
toasted
bread
earthy
hops
a
bit
thin
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
worth
a
try
drinkability
average
at
best
a
relatively
lighter
easydrinking
brown
ale
with
its
biggest
fault
being
the
fact
its
just
so
timid
so
hohum
id
shout
an
enthusiastic
inspiriting
bring
it
to
santa
fes
nut
brown
ale
but
it
would
probably
either
faint
or
crap
its
pants
tsk
tsk
d
good
sweet
drinker
without
anything
offensive
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
faded
quickly
did
not
smell
right
kind
of
musty
and
smelled
well
a
little
bit
like
urine
this
had
a
sweet
tangy
metallic
flavor
that
did
not
settle
well
i
noticed
that
there
were
crystals
and
gunk
all
under
the
cap
and
around
the
top
of
the
bottle
probably
shouldnt
had
tried
it
after
i
saw
this
had
to
dump
this
one
out
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
a
dark
brown
pour
finishes
off
with
a
huge
tan
head
some
garnet
hues
skirt
the
edges
retention
is
good
but
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
smells
of
stale
nuts
mixed
in
with
some
hops
and
pine
a
certain
mustiness
pervades
the
aroma
tastes
of
slightly
toasted
malts
sour
apples
roasted
nuts
and
some
hops
way
in
the
back
body
is
a
little
thinned
out
and
watery
as
is
typical
with
this
style
not
digging
on
this
one
notes
this
one
had
potential
but
the
sour
coppery
taste
is
not
good
and
the
mouthfeel
isnt
doing
it
for
me
either
im
not
planning
on
buying
this
again
pour
medium
dark
brown
color
1
finger
head
that
was
light
brown
getting
just
a
little
bit
of
a
nut
aroma
but
not
much
taste
is
just
a
bit
nutty
again
but
has
a
stronger
metallic
taste
than
anything
and
oddly
enough
kinda
of
tart
or
sour
taste
going
on
pretty
light
even
for
a
brown
ale
light
mouthfeel
this
is
just
okay
nothing
special
at
all
probably
the
worst
brown
ale
i
have
tried
actually
this
is
only
my
second
offering
from
santa
fe
but
neither
were
impressive
drinkability
blek
not
much
good
about
this
one
just
pretty
bland
pretty
sour
pretty
broken
maybe
a
fresh
bottle
would
be
better
and
perhaps
this
one
was
bad
but
still
the
mouth
was
not
too
thin
but
was
far
from
substantial
still
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
while
you
are
in
or
around
the
santa
fe
area
especially
at
the
ski
resorts
during
a
mid
afternoon
break
flavor
is
a
big
letdown
on
this
one
thin
and
watery
with
almost
an
almond
extract
flavor
goes
down
easy
enough
but
is
a
pretty
unexciting
beer
from
an
already
basic
beer
style
bitterness
is
there
toastiness
is
there
but
it
is
lacking
on
roastiness
and
sweet
malty
flavor
also
could
use
more
body
this
brew
pours
up
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
foamy
tan
head
the
nose
is
faint
metallic
malts
and
a
lil
bit
of
booze
the
taste
is
subtle
dry
chocolate
malts
and
slight
chewy
malts
in
the
finish
which
i
do
enjoy
in
my
nut
brown
ales
light
bodied
low
carbo
a
clean
finish
kinda
boring
but
decent
nonetheless
i
can
drink
them
and
im
sure
ill
put
some
more
down
in
the
future
its
pretty
cheap
here
but
id
probably
go
for
a
sierra
blanca
nut
brown
or
something
a
bit
stronger
if
i
had
the
choice
small
beige
head
cloudy
dark
coffee
brown
color
aroma
is
light
buttery
caramel
sweet
almost
like
a
candy
bar
taste
is
also
light
chocolate
toffee
caramel
and

somewhat
watery

light

slightly
toasty
finish
alcohol
slightly
warming
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
pretty
bland
almost
like
a
dark
beer
flavored
soda
water
its
not
awful
but
ill
pass
on
this
next
time
overall
i
didnt
really
like
this
beer
unbalanced
the
malts
were
far
too
overpowering
for
me
to
really
enjoy
this
brew
i
had
this
in
taos
new
mexico
over
the
holidays
and
really
enjoyed
it
had
a
great
dark
brown
color
descent
head
and
great
taste
maybe
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
not
much
drinkability
was
also
pretty
descent
with
this
brew
i
would
for
sure
give
this
beer
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
a
deep
reddish
brown
hue
a
thick
head
but
dissolves
quickly
the
aroma
is
malty
earthy
caramel
with
nutty
hints
the
tastes
is
a
nice
nutty
roasted
malty
taste
with
a
smooth
finish
very
east
to
drink
but
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
thin
will
drink
again
bottle
thanks
to
mmmbeer
my
first
brew
form
new
mexico
pours
a
dark
ruby
hue
with
a
small
white
head
that
goes
down
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
malts
and
fruit
the
taste
really
reminds
me
rogue
hazel
nut
brown
nectar
smooth
and
rich
malts
some
chocolate
a
ton
of
fruit
and
nutty
flavors
almost
akin
to
grapes
really
smooth
and
nice
i
enjoyed
this
one
d
a
damn
fine
brew
with
more
flavors
as
you
drink
this
brew
has
a
delicious
smell
of
peanut
brittle
and
roasted
malts
pours
to
a
deep
metallic
brown
with
a
huge
foamy
head
this
one
pours
like
a
tv
beer
taste
is
a
deep
bitterness
balanced
with
a
very
roasted
malt
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
has
way
too
much
carbonation
and
detracts
from
the
smoothness
of
the
flavor
upon
the
start
of
the
review
this
beer
appeared
to
have
great
potential
but
fell
short
reviewing
the
hometown
brewery
at
last
off
the
tap
this
beer
was
a
dark
brown
with
a
sandycolored
tan
head
the
retention
was
not
much
to
speak
of
nor
was
there
much
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
pleasant
mix
of
light
hops
malt
and
nuts
the
flavors
were
muted
however
caramel
malt
roasted
malt
and
some
nuttiness
but
all
of
them
too
subtle
the
hops
presence
is
also
lacking
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
could
have
been
a
bit
heavier
in
body
hate
to
hate
on
the
hometown
but
i
know
that
crew
does
better
than
this
d
easy
to
mash
were
it
only
available
more
this
beer
poured
quite
a
bit
darker
than
i
was
expecting
it
looked
more
like
a
porter
than
a
brown
almost
modest
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
maybe
somewhat
butterscotchy
it
was
flavorful
and
packed
much
more
off
a
punch
than
i
anticipated
noticeable
hop
presence
browns
should
be
a
little
more
subtle
in
my
opinion
but
not
bad
d
this
beer
has
no
offensive
flavors
just
no
real
flavor
at
all
even
when
it
warms
quite
a
bit
another
good
showing
from
santa
fe
something
you
can
have
a
couple
of
while
sitting
outside
at
night
with
your
friends
d
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
nothing
about
it
really
got
me
excited
if
it
had
a
stronger
taste
and
smell
with
a
little
thicker
body
it
would
be
way
better
pours
a
pretty
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
is
sweet
and
nutty
but
leans
more
towards
the
nutty
side
at
first
then
it
switches
to
a
earthy
tone
though
the
sweet
still
remains
flavor
carries
a
sweet
nutty
tone
as
well
not
overly
complex
or
severely
robust
but
its
noticeable
and
nice
enough
the
carbonation
here
really
attacks
my
mouth
in
a
way
that
makes
it
a
bit
unpleasant
its
almost
like
a
carbonation
aftertaste
liquid
is
standard
overall
a
nice
nut
brown
ale
the
carbonation
is
the
only
thing
that
is
off
santa
fe
nut
brown
ale
is
lazy
beer
its
a
lackluster
version
that
could
stand
an
infusion
of
just
about
everything
more
malt
especially
and
more
hops
would
be
great
places
to
start
bottom
line
forgettable
d
reminds
of
new
castle
but
not
quite
as
good
d
nice
easy
drinking
brown
ale
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
all
in
all
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
consume
many
in
a
session
but
i
wouldnt
this
is
the
most
uninspired
brown
ale
ive
had
to
date
its
drinkable
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
none
of
the
right
if
you
like
watered
down
one
trick
flavors
this
is
your
beer
drinkability
it
was
an
easy
enough
beer
to
drink
but
it
was
just
an
average
experience
this
is
not
necessarily
something
that
i
will
look
to
go
back
to
again
this
is
drinkable
enough
and
a
decent
session
beer
but
there
are
better
brown
ales
out
there
i
discharged
the
contents
of
the
bottle
into
a
large
wine
glass
producing
a
small
dirty
white
head
there
was
some
lacing
as
the
glass
emptied
but
not
much
dark
brown
chocolate
color
and
smelled
extremely
yeasty
with
very
small
hint
of
almonds
nothing
jumped
out
at
me
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
some
roasted
maltyness
but
other
than
that
noting
too
extraordinary
easy
drinking
beer
and
could
easily
empty
a
few
bottles
of
this
in
one
sitting
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
melts
into
a
thin
layer
after
a
few
seconds
aroma
is
slightly
nutty
duh
and
then
goes
into
a
sweet
malty
aroma
taste
is
slightly
chocolaty
with
nuts
and
cream
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
this
is
an
extremely
sessionable
brown
ale
sante
fe
nut
brown
ale
isnt
anything
amazing
but
that
is
what
makes
it
so
drinkable
its
smooth
and
not
too
malty
or
overly
bitter
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
that
is
mild
enough
for
the
most
novice
of
drinkers
but
also
interesting
enough
to
keep
beer
savants
into
it

quite
dark

with
a
fairly
healthy

settles
to
a
ring
very
roasty
smelling
a
bit
more
than

for

characteristic
some
sweet
malt
in

background

there

a

a
fairly
dsolidd
brown
ale
tasted
on
21908
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
very
black
and
since
i
ama
nut
brown
nut
i
was
ver
hopeful
of
this
new
beer
thetaste
was
a
littlr
malty
with
a
nuttiness
ever
so
slightly
the
taste
was
faintly
sweet
it
was
an
okay
beer
but
tasted
fake
to
me
like
not
real
flavours
i
will
not
buy
again
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
brown
ale
but
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
not
that
i
particularly
enjoyed
any
of
it
it
just
went
down
rather
quickly
so
it
has
that
going
for
itself
a
fine
representation
of
a

easy
drinking

this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
if
this
beer
ever
makes
it
to
the

be
a
session
beer
for
me
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
witha
short
offwhite
head
that
laces
the
glass
a
little
bit
all
the
way
down
it
had
an
aroma
of
deep
roasted
malts
some
faint
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
nuts
the
taste
was
really
good
it
had
flavors
of
roasted
earthy
roasted
malts
layered
with
some
very
faint
hops
followed
by
an
aftertaste
of
nuts
the
mouthfeel
had
a
nice
crisp
and
smooth
feeling
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
beer
like
this
the
drinkability
is
good
as
i
would
definatley
have
a
few
of
these
before
the
night
was
over

there

should
be

very

make

beer
flavor
is
much
more
of
the
same
with

and
a
slightly
sticky
finish
not
too
much
to
detract
from
the
brew
12
oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
small
coat
of
head
over
top
that
dissipates
to
islands
over
top
there
is
good
clarity
in
this
one
and
very
few
bubbles
seen
in
the
brew
i
woulld
like
a
larger
head
with
the
aggressive
pour
i
gave
it
but
otherwise
it
looks
nice
the
aroma
is
solid
with
nice
caramel
and
nut
coming
through
behind
a
fairly
solid
roasted
malt
the
roast
is
a
little
dominant
in
this
one
for
a
nut
brown
the
flavor
brings
more
of
what
i
am
looking
for
there
is
a
decent
nuty
sweetness
with
some
caramel
notes
laying
below
that
what
i
find
interesting
is
that
these
flavors
really
take
a
long
time
into
the
aftertaste
to
really
come
through
initially
this
one
just
comes
through
as
bubbly
and
neutral
i
would
like
to
be
hit
with
more
on
the
start
and
not
have
to
wait
for
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lower
end
of
moderate
with
a
modertae
bunch
of
very
fine
bubbles
attacking
my
tongue
not
too
bad
overall
this
brew
is
servicable
to
me
the
flavor
really
needs
to
come
through
stronger
initially
it
could
use
a
little
boost
all
around
i
think
pours
out
a
dark
hazelnut
with
constant
cascading
bubbles
and
a
thick
khaki
head
that
leaves
some
raised
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
walnuts
dried
fruits
and
just
lots
of
fruity
esters
in
general
caramel
is
really
big
in
the
nose
i
think
i
get
some
melon
in
there
as
well
the
darker
malts
dont
hold
much
presence
in
the
flavor
aside
from
a
fleeting
chocolate
character
in
the
finish
mostly
what
i
taste
is
a
mix
of
stone
fruits
and
nuts
maybe
a
little
maple
syrup
too
hops
quietly
appear
in
the
aftertaste
finishes
kind
of
sweet
mouthfeel
is
fulsome
and
the
carbonation
is
really
smooth
drinkability
is
just
fine
theres
not
much
special
about
this
beer
but
it
would
be
good
for
just
when
you
want
a
couple
okay
not
highly
flavorful
shows
some
of
those
northern
english
brown
qualities
could
be
more
solid
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
info
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
mahogany
highlights
the
head
was
just
over
1
finger
and
tannish
it
settled
to
a
collar
with
a
constant
carb
fountain
in
the
center
the
smell
was
toasted
malts
with
an
underlying
nuttiness
the
taste
was
above
average
and
had
a
good
nutty
bite
but
was
a
bit
bland
its
not
an
overwhelmingly
flavorful
beer
but
does
go
down
smooth
it
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
a
session
probably
even
for
your
friends
who
live
the
macros

outstanding
fyi
after
revisiting
santa
fe
a
few
times
i
have
to
mention
that
this
beer
is
much
better
on
tap
actually
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
on
draft
this
beer
goes
from
pretty
good
to
virtually
stellar
just
a
heads
up
for
anyone
visiting
the
area
luckily
this
is
like
the
santa
fe
version
of
fat
tire
you
can
find
it
anywhere
and
everywhere
there
drinks
pretty
good
not
a
great
brown
but
not
bad
ive
had
this
before
when
it
wasnt
too
fresh
id
say
this
was
an
improvement
d
good
drinkability
i
like
the
full
body
and
the
chocolatey
flavor
on
this
one
a
little
sweet
looks
just
like
what
everyone
else
says
but
really
when
did
you
last
have
a
brown
ale
that
you
took
a
drink
of
and
thought
hmmm
tasty
pretty
average
brown
ale
seems
a
little
thin
and
not
bursting
with
any
flavor
or
complexity
d
this
brew
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
seems
to
me
there
are
just
not
too
many
good
brown
ales
out
there
ill
pass
over
this
one
unless
i
could
try
it
fresh
from
the
brewery
until
then
ill
be
just
fine
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
overall
impression
british
overtones
some
enjoyable
mild
tastes
but
the
metallic
edge
and
grainy
husky
notes
coupled
with
the
light
fizzy
texture
really
didnt
float
my
boat
i
would
look
at
water
chemistry
or
exposed
metal
in
the
system
and
drop
the
mash
temp
website
lists
a
high
mash
temp
to
address
the
husky
note
not
trying
to
play
brewer
just
trying
to
give
some
positive
feedback
decent
brown
ale
quite
drinkable
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
fruity
mix
of
raisin
and
cherry
notes
a
sort
of
nutty
malt
note
is
quickly
followed
by
the
hint
of
cheesiness
that
was
found
in
the
aroma
though
luckily
it
is
a
bit
more
muted
in
the
flavor
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
it
keeps
it
easy
drinking
but
seems
like
it
could
use
a
bit
more
richness
especially
for
a
nut
brown
this
beer
is
riding
the
line
between
being
good
and
not
worth
trying
again
if
it
picked
up
a
bit
more
body
and
got
rid
of
the
stale
cheesy
note
i
would
be
happy
drink
a
pint
or
so
of
this
beer
again
just
an
average
brown
ale
almost
newcastlelike
no
real
hop
presence
pours
passable
brown
amber
with
a
medimthick

slightly
at
toasted

going
down
in

another
great
beer
from
cigar
city
brewing
i
hope
this
company
expands
their
distribution
to
new
england
excellent
brews
overall
when
i
tried
this
with
some
coworkers
everyone
liked
it
easy
to
turn
people
into
craft
beer
drinkers
with
this
one
too
bad
its
only
available
in
florida
an
awesome
more
traditional
brown
ale
but
still
with
some
perfectly
tweaked
twists
awesome
stuff
as
usual
from
cigar
city
final
thoughts
the
drier
aspects
of
this
beer
really
lend
it
towards
fish
or
moist
rich
chocolate
deserts
i
think
the
picture
on
this
beer
really
speaks
volumes
to
what
it
is
i
would
want
to
drink
it
at
the
same
that
i
would
want
to
have
a
cigar
typically
in
the
twilight
hours
after
dinner
or
during
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
ive
been
so
far
pleased
with
everything
cigar

has
offered
appearance
deep
brilliant

a
really

one

my
new
favorites
super

no

malty
coffee
taste
builds
into
sweet
chocolate
and
ends
with
a
dry
malty
flavor
much
like
newcastle
mouthfeel
seemed
thin
for
the
style
and
flavor
which
was
disappointing
overall
an
above
average
brown
ale
that
would
do
good
for
sipping
with

not

some
sweetness
but
not
too
much
no
coffee
but
there
is
something
darker
and
roasted
smooth
and
very
good
texture
not
sure
what
brown
ale
is
supposed
to
taste
like
ideally
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer

great
by

one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
fantastic
beer
worldclass
brown
ale
o
keep
sending
cigar
city
brewing
to
upstate
new
york
for
the
first
time
i
found
their
stuff
in
my
area
tonight
and
i
sincerely
hope
more
is
on
the
way
i
had
heard
great
things
about
these
brews
and
they
do
not
disappoint
if
you
are
a
fan
of
brown
ales
this
needs
to
be
on
your
list

tastes
to
me
like
a
cross
between
a
porter
and
a
brown
ale
not
bad
but
nothing
exceptional
has
a
rather
light
feel
to
it
with
a
good
carbonation
to
it
o
rather
more
like
a
coffee
porter
than
an
english
brown
flavor
is
dominated
by
increasingly
bitter
coffee
rather
than
caramel
malt
ok
as
such
but
not
a
favorite
for
the
style
overall
dont
get
me
wrong
i
cut
my
teeth
on
this
style
of
beer
but
after
having
so
many
beers
in
varying
styles
over
the
years
this
style
has
become
kind
of
boring
and
commonplace
however
this
one
is
better
than
most
i
do
appreciate
this
extra
in
the
trade
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
again
cigar
city
does
makes
some
above
average
beers
but
this
one
is
in
my
opinion
solidly
average
not
my
top
brown
ale
but
i
will
certainly
purchase
it
again

feels
like
fused

poop
solid
coffee
tasting
beer
from
a
kickass
brewery
on
sight
cigar
city
brewing
maduro
pours
a
bright
mahogany
thats
relatively
clear
with
a
tannish
head
the
head
dissipates
relatively
quickly
but
the
brew
gives
off
a
deep
scent
of
caramel
toffee
nuts
and
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
scent
is
deep
complex
and
adds
notes
of
woodsy
elements
molasses
espresso
and
cigar
wrapper
being
able
to
draw
something
off
the
top
isnt
a
stretch
but
it
is
wonderful
in
its
complexity
on
the
palate
it
starts
out
a
little
light
and
maintains
a
slightly
thin
body
the
flavors
are
balanced
between
nutty
flavors
and
the
more
sugary
malt
notes
like
brown
sugar
caramel
and
molasses
theres
an
underlying
bitterness
thats
vaguely
coffee
inspired
on
the
end
it
finishes
quickly
with
just
touches
of
caramel
and
cigar
wrapper
really
kinda
average
aroma
was
outstanding
lots
of
big
roasts
then
the
flavor
was
rather
bitter
and
ashy
almost
o
a
milder
brown
ale
punctuated
with
roasty
coffee
it
kind
of
ends
up
as
an
inbetweener
i
like
it
but
not
that
excited
by
it
still
a
good
brown
ale
one
finger
off
white
head
that
slowly
dissipated
aroma
of
coffee
and
chocolate
tastes
as
it
smells
but
with
some
smoky
flavor
and
maybe
some
oak
much
maltier
than
i
would
expect
from
your
average
brown
mediumlight
body
with
smooth
mouth
feel
taste
of
dark
chocolate
lingers
on
the
palate
probably
one
of
the
best
browns
i
have
tried
very
good
brown
ale
better
ccb
beers
though
too
much
molasses
flavor
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
in
bottles
not
sure
if
the
can
is
a
different
recipe
but
its
still
very
tasty
stuff
a
world
class
brown
ale
for
sure
poured
from
a
can
medium
brown
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
little
lacing
id
like
to
try
a
draft
nitro
version
of
this
one
the
aroma
gives
a
hint
of
mocha
and
is
very
pleasing
the
taste
is
to
me
what
an
english
brown
ale
should
be
it
combines
nuttiness
with
traces
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
low
hop
presence
very
drinkable
top

in
brown
ales

to
drink
but
lives

of
meal
beer
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
if
i
find
it
available
i
jump
at
the
chance
to
buy
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
minimal
head
the
nose
features
moderate
roasted
malts
light
coffee
notes
and
some
creamy
oatmeal
character
the
taste
mild
up
front
with
increasingly
strong
roasted
barley
as
it
passes
the
palate
chocolate
and
oatmeal
present
with
mild
hop
bitterness
towards
the
end
moderate
to
high
carbonation
with
lightish
body
overall
good
flavors
just
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
in
terms
of
flavor
overall
a
really
nice
beer
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
when
your
enjoying
a
nice
smoked
brisket
or
something
similar
or
when
the
weather
is
a
little
cooler
o
nice
malt
heavy
brown
good
flavors
of
nuts
omuch
sweeter
than
i
expected
and
juicy
its
an
interesting
brown
ale
not
as
boring
as
some
but
i
usually
like
the
caramel
malts
to
be
featured
a
little
more
nice
twist
on
the
nuttiness
in
here
as
well
though
worth
a
try
but
nothing
you
should
go
out
of
your
way
for
mouthfeel
is
smooth
velvety
came
to
mind
overall
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
brown
overall
beautiful
example
of
an
english
brown
ale
i
cant
wait
to
have
it
at
a
cookout
rich
and
complex
enjoyable
interesting
and
repeatable
would
go
great
with
dessert
after
dinner
would
definitely
try
this
again
a
good
friend
of
mine
had
this
beer
to
split
with
my
beer
guru
and
me
they
both
liked
it
so
my
expectations
were
high
typically
i
am
kinda
luke
warm
on
browns
but
really
liked
this
one
i
would
have
to
put
it
right
there
with
samuel
smiths
as
my
favorite
brown
i
will
certainly
look
to
buy
this
one
again
in
the
future

nothing

nothing
great
about

just
ok
for
a
brown
with
a
slightly
bland

confusing
mix

almost
mahogany

o
glad
to
try
this
and
a
very
different
beer
from
the
core
maduro
brown
this
bottle
had
a
good
year
of
age
on
it
so
a
fresher
bottle
might
be
a
bit
different
pours
dark
brown
with
nice
head
the
smell
doesnt
really
smell
like
a
nut
brown
kind
of
doesnt
smell
much
like
anything
ive
had
actually
luckily
the
taste
came
through
and
was
very
good
kind
if
heavy
and
thick
with
some
chocolate
notes
coming
through
very
smooth
on
the
tough
overall
i
enjoyed
it
might
not
be
world
class
but
its
definitely
one
that
i
enjoyed
od
very
much
what
they
tried
to
put
together
i
think
a
nice
beer
that
was
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
the
nose
is
rich
with
notes
of
notes
chocolate
and
molasses
the
palate
mainly
follows
the
nose
but
is
sadly
less
expressive
a
bit
faint
with
not
much
length
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
but
a
bit
thin
o
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
which
is
the
same
thing
i
said
about
maduro
i
do
believe
the
more
i
have
from
cigar
city
the
more
i
think
they
really
know
what
the
hell
theyre
doing
down
there
in
florida
o
this
was
a
very
nice
higher
octane
brown
ale
i
could
see
myself
reaching
for
this
one
on
occasion
if
it
were
available
here
in
wisconsin
glad
to
recommend

huge

with
good

and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
theres
definitely
loads
of
malt
here
but
the
allaround
package
is
just
bad
ive
never
encountered
dms
at
this
level
in
a
bottled
production
brewerys
product
but
if
i
had
to
guess
thats
what
this
one
is
displaying
quality
control
please
this
never
should
have
even
made
it
into
the
bottles
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
definitely
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
crisp
and
strong
with
a
sweet
feel
that
still
makes
you
appreciate
quality
salud
o
definitely
infected
but
actually
still
pretty
decent
just
different
than
intended
a
bit
of
a
twang
on
the
tongue
but
some
smokey
and
roasty
and
earthy
malt
still
comes
thru
a
bit
dry
overall
from
the
infection

this
a
truly
outstanding
beer
for
the
style

easy
to
drink
really
excellent
brown
ale
yum
not
my
favorite
offering
from
ccb
but
still
very
good
a
bit
like
a
stronger
version
of
maduro
with
more
of
a
roasted
peanut
taste
o
bolita
may
be
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
ever
tasted
the
presence
of
sour
flavor
compliments
all
the
extensive
flavors
in
this
brew
i
need
cigar
city
to
come
to
syracuse
asap
cheers
d
pretty
decent
double
brown
i
wish
the
weird
flavors
werent
present
because
i
could
tell
what
was
under
them
was
a
really
nice
brown
ale
dark
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
slowly
recedes
leaving
light
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
toffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
nutty
and
chocolately
with
some
carbonic
bite
and
a
raisiny
finish
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
sipper
thats
heavy
but
not
too
boozy
it
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
heavierbodied
to
match
the
taste
but
overall
this
is
quite
good
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
a
ruby
hue
against
light
mostly
clear
massive
rocky
foamy
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
with
soapy
lacing
slightly
tart
fruity
nose
lurks
under
the
robust
brown
ale
notes
molasses
peanut
brown
sugar
and
ash
syrupy
thick
body
highly
carbonated
and
fizzy
much
more
berry
fruit
in
the
flavor
and
tartness
in
the
finish
i
assume
there
is
a
nice
imperial
brown
ale
hiding
here
i
get
some
milk
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
peanuts
in
the
flavor
but
the
infection
ruins
it
o
wish
this
was
available
to
me
in
ny
a
fantastic
take
on
the
classic
english
brown
ale
big
alcohol
bite
wonderful
warming
cocoa
and
charred
wood
and
spice
really
nice
creaminess
with
a
surprising
hoppy
punch
o
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
hat
seems
to
work
really
well
for
this
beer
still
has
elements
of
a
traditional
brown
ale
just
amped
up
a
bit
o
very
pleasurable
o
what
a
treat
its
mild
like
most
browns
yet
has
several
subtly
interesting
and
pleasant
things
going
on
nice
gentle
buzz
really
a
great
beer
they
say
it
would
pair
well
with
a
cigar
and
theyre
right
ive
never
heard
of
a
double
brown
but
im
so
on
board
with
the
idea
now
turns
out
its
exactly
what
i
wanted
this
brewery
continues
to
impress
o
fine
tasting
beer
if
you
like
sweet
ones
for
me
the
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
due
to
the
thick
sweet
body
really
nice
nut
flavors
come
through
sweet
base
o
this
beer
was
decent
but
not
my
favorite
i
definitely
prefer
the
maduro
i
liked
the
smoothness
and
creaminess
of
the
beer
however
it
was
slightly
too
nutty
and
the
chocolate
taste
was
a
little
bit
too
syrupy
the
abv
was
well
hidden
and
the
beer
was
easily
drinkable
the
only
improvement
they
could
make
is
to
take
a
little
bit
of
the
chocolate
syrup
flavor
out
overall
a
good
beer
but
some
improvements
could
be
made
o
strange
beer
to
me
because
it
came
across
much
sweeter
than
expected
the
sweetness
was
interesting
but
i
wanted
more
malt
alcohol
was
well
hidden
well
and
i
did
enjoy
drinking
it
however
in
a
bar
situation
one
pint
probably
would
have
been
enough
o
terrific
unusual
style
to
be
hoppy
for
a
brown
ale
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
oxidizedwoodpaper
notes
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
disappointing
o
liked
this
quite
a
bit
loved
the
heavy
chocolate
aroma
and
flavors
on
the
heavier
side
for
style
but
makes
up
for
it
in
terms
of
taste
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
the
flavor
is
excellent
and
complex
it
loses
some
points
because
the
nose
wasnt
particularly
appetizing
but
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
though
more
like
a
stout
than
a
brown
ale
still
it
smells
great
and
tastes
good
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
just
a
flavor
bomb
and
nice
warming
effect
along
with
it
i
want
to
say
its
like
a
good
brown
ale
met
a
good
strong
ale
this
might
be
my
first
double
brown
ale
but
bolita
seems
to
capture
the
idea
of
the
style
nicely
a
bit
sweet
but
it
shows
off
some
decent
brown
flavors
not
a
ton
of
experience
with
this
style
especially
the
doubleimperial
version
but
im
really
digging
this
one
sam
smith
was
my
fave
english
brown
until
some
crazy
brewery
from
fl
decided
to
make
a
double
version
yum
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
on
the
mark
i
dont
think
i
would
change
anything
about
this
beer
o
a
b
overall
average
huh
i
thing
by
now
i
know
a
great
beer
in
a
particular
style
when
i
taste
see
and
smell
it
i
based
on
that
im
going
to
give
this
one
my
highest
recommendation
bottle
poured
a
deep
cloudy
brown
color
ale
with
a
nice
light
brown
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
caramelized
nutty
malt
with
light
dry
hops
is
very
interesting
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
caramelized
malt
with
balanced
level
of
sweetens
and
a
light
dry
hoppy
finish
body
is
full
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
easily
drinkable
brew
with
nice
level
of
complexity
i
cant
give
1s
across
the
board
because
i
know
this
beers
actual
potential
hopefully
ccb
has
done
a
little
better
with
their
quality
control
since
the
time
i
purchased
this
brew
i
had
heard
stories
of
random
infections
in
ccb
brews
but
this
beer
confirmed
it
this
pours
a
cloudy
espresso
consistancy
with
a
beautiful
coffee
cream
colored
lacing
the
foam
head
lasted
a
few
minutes
and
from
then
on
had
a
thin
lacing
the
aroma
that
comes
off
this
has
sweet
coffee
malty
and
herbal
hop
notes
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
english
yeast
notes
along
with
a
beautiful
sweet
coffee
and
herbal
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
thick
with
a
medium
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
so
far
it
is
really
rich
and
malty
along
with
a
nice
herbal
hoppiness
this
also
very
drinkable
and
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
45
in
one
sitting
on
a
side
note
this
would
very
good
with
a
nice
steak
because
it
would
bring
out
the
nice
caramelized
flavors
of
the
steak
this
beer
is
very
good
and
very
drinkable
750ml
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
but
see
through
brown
colorn
with
nice
nice
thick
creamlike
dark
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
sweet
caramel
this
is
a
complex
smell
i
get
some
different
ever
time
i
smell
i
even
get
some
like
woddy
shell
like
smell
taste
isnt
too
sweet
like
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
i
get
a
roasty
nut
flavor
with
some
bitter
sweet
chocolate
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
this
was
a
good
complex
beer
and
not
too
boozy
considering
the
alcohol
cheers
overall
a
very
drinkable
complex
brown
ale
i
was
quite
surprised
by
the
complexity
and
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
can
get
their
hands
on
some
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
and
carbonation
is
low
overall
in
its
current
state
it
was
a
pretty
bad
beer
this
unfortunately
seems
to
be
a
trend
with
too
many
cigar
city
beers
ive
tried
the
rest
of
this
one
is
getting
poured
out
after
this
review
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
a
very
good
beer
hard
to
say
that
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
style
since
they
call
it
a
double
nut
brown
but
it
has
some
of
the
nut
brown
character
this
reminds
me
of
a
dryer
less
sweet
version
of
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
without
the
massive
chocolate
by
that
i
mean
there
is
a
lot
of
richness
that
i
dont
associate
with
an
english
brown
or
porter
but
the
flavors
match
pretty
well
with
a
brown
i
would
not
mind
a
sixer
of
this
on
occasion
but
a
750ml
is
too
pricyhard
to
drink
highly
recommended
definitely
worth
trying

it

like
it
lacks
something
to
take
it
to
the
next
level
overly
spiced
perhaps
maybe
a
pleasant
and
interesting
double
brown
ale
nonetheless
there
are
all
the
flavours
there
of
a
thick

bomb
but
it
just
falls
short
on
the
wham
factor
that
i
otherwise
expected
jasons

another

rich

yeasty

funky
sour

right
there
decent
drinkability
but
another
cc
i
would
have
only
once
full
mouthfeel
nice
beer
but
i
wish
i
loved
it
more
it
has
a
lot
of
nice
characters
but
its
missing
cohesion
for
me
please
cigar
city
come
to
new
jersey
overall
its
not
too
bad
not
too
drinkable
for
me
though
its
quite
a
thick
mouth
feel
a
little
much
to
me
its
my
first
real
rodeo
w
this
style
i
enjoyed
the
first
glass
by
itself
then
paired
this
w
a
piece
of
riesen
chocolate
that
really
helped
get
ride
of
some
of
the
burn
seemed
to
play
w
each
other
really
well
drink
it
was
90
degrees
outside
and
poured
into
a
foam
cup
good
times
this
was
actually
my
first
beer
from
ccb
not
counting
marron
nice
beer
o
ill
definitely
rereview
this
beer
but
as
for
now
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
its
got
the
full
sticky
ccb
body
that
i
know
and
love
and
the
drinkability
is
downright
dangerous
for
the
abv
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
marred
only
slightly
by
a
bit
of
offtaste
on
the
finish
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
from
the
next
batch
to
see
if
its
just
batch
variation
pours
a
brownish
to
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
nuttiness
and
a
small
roast
in
the
taste
a
small
roast
nutty
and
a
small
alcohol
and
boozy
flavor
in
the
end
a
small
alcohol
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
nut
and
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
a
big
brown
ale

hints

it
sneaks
up

you

d
count
me
as
a
big
fan
o
this
beer
is
almost
creating
a
new
genre
id
call
it
a
nut
brown
stout
it
was
a
really
enjoyable
experience
even
though
i
was
drinking
it
on
my
balcony
on
a
nice
summer
night
this
is
more
of
a
winter
sipper
o
a
great
beer
that
doesnt
quite
hide
its
imperial
strength
well
enough
o
i
had
a
hard
time
reviewing
this
one
i
bought
this
bottle
last
december
and
just
decided
to
finally
open
it
up
this
one
was
not
infected
in
any
way
but
i
just
wasnt
in
the
mood
for
such
a
deep
heavy
beer
on
a
summer
day
also
if
you
were
to
rate
this
beer
to
the
style
it
doesnt
fit
it
in
the
least
but
it
really
doesnt
claim
to
either
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
rather
enjoyable
complex
but
not
overly
so
very
well
balanced
and
quite
flavorful
o
i
may
have
gotten
this
at
the
beginning
of
an
infection
or
maybe
its
just
overcarbonated
and
the
tartness
is
supposed
to
be
there
either
way
i
enjoyed
the
bottled
i
had
will
have
to
grab
another
bottle
in
the
future
and
compare
it
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
boasting
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
despite
the
green
character
surrounding
it
with
a
light
tingle
of
alcohol
that
keeps
things
in
check
it
poured
a
dark
dark
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
beige
colored
head
the
beer
poured
full
in
body
and
was
very
viscous
it
smells
of
lightly
roasted
malts
moderate
sweet
chocolate
light
nuttiness
and
some
cream
it
tastes
of
sweet
chocolate
light
roast
and
has
a
nice
nutty
finish
that
isnt
too
much
and
finishes
quite
sweet
like
their
other
beers
that
come
in
750s
that
ive
had
so
far
it
drinks
very
very
smoothly
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
but
after
awhile
it
does
get
to
be
a
little
sweet
thats
keeping
me
from
rating
it
higher
its
a
solid
beer
and
from
what
i
understand
a
steal
for
the
price
im
a
big
enough
cigar
city
fan
to
be
almost
counted
a
homer
but
im
grossly
disappointed
with
backtoback
bad
bottles
good
thing
there
were
a
hellacious
amount
of
other
excellent
beers
in
that
box
mike
o
great
tasting
allaround
beer
o
well
this
is
one
bad
beer
totally
infected
and
barely
consumable
im
fighting
my
way
through
the
glass
but
im
not
sure
if
i
can
do
it
good
medium
body
on
this
bordering
a
bit
on
the
heavier
side
nice
soft
carbonation
here
too
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
probably
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
ones
of
the
style
that
ive
had
tone
down
the
yeast
and
this
one
is
rock
solid
i
like
this
but
i
wish
it
had
a
little
less
yeast
spice
the
malt
flavors
are
nice
o
very
happy
with
this
take
on
a
brown
ale
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
almost
any
in
its
category
a
fine
offering
from
cigar
city
as
they
continue
to
impress
me
i
took
an
8oz
sample
from
1
750ml
bottle
and
poured
into
snifter
on
04252011
dark
brown
and
black
topped
by
a
mocha
head
great
retention
and
good
lace
my
nose
immediately
picks
up
an
off
flavor
not
much
else
going
on
here
this
is
bad
i
taste
a
metallic
off
flavor
slight
malty
caramel
a
bitterness
bites
the
tongue
an
inspection
of
the
bottle
shows
rust
on
the
cap
and
on
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
which
could
explain
the
bad
taste
full
body
with
decent
carbonation
clearly
i
had
a
bad
bottle
and
a
definite
drain
pour
i
will
try
again
with
another
bottle
in
the
future
and
edit
my
review
o
ccbs
bolita
brown
is
a
really
killer
interpretation
of
a
fairly
played
out
style
good
drinking
all
around
one
of
the
best
browns
on
the
market
oat
first
i
was
drinking
this
amazed
thinking
of
how
lucky
i
was
being
able
to
sip
on
such
a
fantastic
brew
but
then
i
remembered
i
bought
this
for
7
99
at
a
world
market
to
me
thats
an
amazing
price
for
a
perfect
ccb
750ml
beer
and
to
find
it
at
a
world
market
no
less
this
is
an
amazing
brown
ale
it
is
so
completely
drinkable
beer
is
thinner
than
i
expected
and
boozier
than
i
expected
the
flavors
are
dominantly
sweet
malt
followed
by
ethanol
followed
by
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
almost
tastes
like
it
was
aged
in
a
barrel
but
not
quite
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
booziness
got
to
be
after
a
bit
id
have
a
small
amount
again
tons
of
roasted
nuttiness
unbelievably
smooth
and
creamy
i
could
drink
6
of
these
massive
pint
bottles
and
still
want
more
a
seasonal
brew
with
no
specific
release
timewhenever
they
feel
its
ready
i
guess
if
you
can
find
this
i
highly
highly
recommend
it
my
first
cigar
city
beer
fell
a
little
short
for
me
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
will
not
be
trying
more
of
them
the
sweetness
is
just
a
little
too
over
the
top
for
me
dark
brown
with
off
white
head
nice
lacing
and
retention
the
smell
is
sweet
fruity
with
notes
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
nutty
some
cocoa
characteristics
sweet
malts
dark
fruit
some
woody
and
roasted
notes
simple
but
good
earthy
hops
in
the
back
with
a
little
floral
character
thick
and
a
bit
syrupy
overall
very
drinkable
do
started
on
this
without
knowing
as
much
as
what
style
it
was
it
grew
on
me
over
11
ounces
to
be
blunt
recommended
for
brown
ale
fans
my
first
cigar
city
rich
dark
brown
pour
just
menacing
looking
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
just
towered
over
the
top
of
the
glass
fading
slowly
it
left
behind
tons
of
side
glass
lacing
and
a
huge
amount
of
spider
like
webs
aroma
was
sweet
and
spicy
at
the
same
time
notes
of
rye
brown
sugar
molasses
like
touches
and
hints
of
coffee
are
all
coming
through
very
clearly
each
sip
now
seem
to
get
a
bit
more
complex
then
the
one
before
it
really
very
well
done
here
rich
chocolate
notes
blending
well
now
with
huge
malts
and
a
touch
of
rye
that
are
just
fantastic
light
suagry
finish
with
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
back
just
enough
to
push
it
over
the
edge
for
me
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
had
no
issues
at
all
with
polishing
this
one
off
picked
up
a
large
bottle
at
abes
for
9
50
and
split
ti
with
a
friend
i
generally
love
cigar
city
beers
but
this
one
fell
flat
for
me
there
was
a
big
fruity
winelike
character
with
a
little
roast
and
chocolate
but
it
was
disappointingly
simple
the
body
was
heavy
and
smooth
for
the
most
part
with
just
balancing
bitterness
for
the
weight
of
this
brown
ale
id
expect
more
varied
notes
maybe
it
just
needs
time
is
a
cellar
or
has
had
too
much
either
way
i
like
this
brewery
enough
to
give
this
another
shot
eventually
to
be
continued
d
very
drinkable
great
blend
of
roasted
malts
and
sweetness
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
i
would
get
this
brew
again
o
a
delicious
english
brown
ale
with
interesting
flavor
profiles
the
lack
of
noticeable
abv
makes
this
dangerously
drinkable
though
this
has
got
to
be
a
clichè
i
could
really
see
enjoying
this
with
a
cigar
cant
wait
to
try
other
cigar
city
brews
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
but
i
still
prefer
the
regular
maduro
brown
from
cigar
city
because
of
availability
and
sessionable
abv
definitely
a
great
beer
with
zero
indication
of
the
9
abv
this
is
worth
trying
if
available
i
dont
need
to
revisit
it
and
you
dont
have
to
break
you
back
to
get
it
but
still
recommended
the
beer
was
very
nice
some
very
nice
well
put
flavors
my
only
problem
was
the
molasses
flavor
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
of
a
little
annoying
definitely
a
unique
and
tasty
take
on
the
classic
style
overall
i
thought
i
remembered
enjoying
this
beer
more
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
thought
it
was
good
and
i
would
have
it
again
the
flavors
im
picking
up
with
the
malt
are
nice
together
not
sure
i
really
ever
fully
understood
or
completely
enjoyed
this
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
im
just
not
sure
there
is
anything
really
right
with
it
either
db
i
suppose
it
does
feel
like
a
double
nut
brown
huge
all
around
brown
ale
flavors
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
though
there
seems
to
be
a
really
rich
satiating
tasty
beer
here
somewhere
but
that
is
slowly
being
consumed
by
something
that
shouldnt
be
here
this
is
still
not
full
blown
infected
yet
but
it
is
on
its
way
and
with
all
the
residual
sugars
these
bottles
might
get
quite
explosive
basically
a
brown
ale
on
steroids
at
the
time
i
didnt
know
this
was
an
english
style
nut
brown
that
explains
alot
this
may
be
the
nuttiest
beer
ive
had
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
definitely
a
beer
to
split
but
good
very
good
beer
it
balances
nicely
very
rich
a
good
buy
for
sure
o
eh
the
booziness
comes
off
pretty
strongly
and
i
dont
like
how
the
combination
of
flavors
really
jives
all
that
much
its
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
chewy
tasty
and
sweet
this
is
a
huge
dessert
of
a
beer
i
will
enjoy
every
one
of
the
25
ounces
in
this
bottle
drinkability
is
really
good
here
despite
the
high
abv
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
falls
a
bit
short
on
drinkabilty
for
the
style
but
in
general
its
a
tasty
treat
that
i
could
find
room
for
50oz
of
drinkability
this
was
a
treat
while
justina1
and
i
werent
too
impressed
with
bolita
double
nut
brown
early
on
it
really
grew
on
us
as
it
warmed
delicious
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
deep
brown
pour
with
a
slight
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
has
chocolate
toffee
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
like
the
nose
chocolate
and
toffee
with
a
lingering
nuttychocolate
finish
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
adequete
carbonation
well
hidden
alcohol
even
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
did
like
this
beer
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
i
would
try
this
again
as
it
is
an
interesting
example
of
the
style
dthis
beer
really
falls
flat
it
really
does
smells
and
tastes
like
dirt
not
recommended
overall
a
very
nice
brew
from
ccb
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
in
the
world
as
is
the
case
for
many
ba
however
i
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
will
be
able
to
finish
the
750ml
bottle
no
problem
overall
very
good
beer
overall
this
reminded
me
more
of
a
milk
stout
than
a
brown
ale
but
since
imperial
brown
ale
isnt
a
real
style
i
wont
deduct
any
points
for
that
this
is
a
beer
that
is
worth
trying
another
good
offering
from
cigar
city
shared
with
my
brewing
partner
pours
super
dark
brownish
black
amazing
looking
creamy
head
chestnut
in
color
so
dense
it
leaves
lacing
reminicent
of
guiness
aroma
is
nutty
with
some
wafts
of
alcohol
taste
is
chocolate
and
hazelnut
forward
with
a
medium
long
roasty
finish
highly
drinkable
and
smooth
for
such
a
big
beer
creamy
and
smooth
over
the
palate
i
dont
like
brown
ales
i
keep
telling
myself
that
but
this
beer
begs
the
question
do
i
d
a
pretty
good
imperial
brown
ale
with
light
bitter
hopping
and
a
lot
of
attention
to
the
nut
side
of
the
flavor
equation
i
liked
ccbs
standrad
brown
ale
about
as
much
but
i
am
glad
i
could
try
this
one
ultimately
its
one
id
revisit
upon
aging
because
the
malt
character
seems
to
be
pretty
interesting
and
could
develop
some
nice
roasty
notes
plus
the
guy
on
the
bottle
is
old
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
even
more
so
as
it
warms
up
average
drink
good
for
a
tasting
but
not
for
everyday
use
i
think
it
tastes
like
a
jackedup
maduro
lots
and
lots
of
roast
coffee
nuts
with
more
obvious
thickness
and
alcohol
good
but
id
probably
rather
have
a
maduro
as
i
find
its
flavor
profile
similar
with
less
alcohol
mouth
is
wonderfully
smooth
without
being
too
heavy
or
chewy
while
not
the
most
intricate
ccb
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
a
typically
under
appreciated
style
this
would
make
a
great
candidate
for
an
addition
to
ccbs
six
pack
lineup
very
interesting
and
good
beer
subtle
flavors
that
blend
well
together
m
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
viscous
chewy
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
for
9
and
a
very
good
brown
ale
highly
recommended
d
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
the
750
went
down
with
no
trouble
at
all
another
solid
offering
from
cigar
city
a
likely
repeat
purchase
cheers

i
dont
because
i
like
it
and
may

issues
with
self
control
the
body
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
it
has
substance
without
feeling
like
a
meal
it
does
have
a

anything
double

should
the
carbonation
is
good
as
well
overall
a
great
brew
from
cigar
city
also
a
great
nut
brown
a
style
i
feel
has
been
lacking
in
quality
examples
my
entire
drinking
career
drinkability
abv
be
damned
this
is
an
all
night
kind
of
beer
really
great
set
of
flavors
and
a
body
that
isnt
too
heavy
or
thick
or
chewy
or
anything
fullbodied
rich
and
creamy
very
light
effervescence
see
above
smooth
with
a
slight
coating
an
extremely
good
brew
this
beer
pours
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
its
a
very
complex
beer
with
little
aroma
im
surprised
that
will
this
big
and
complex
a
beer
the
aroma
isnt
more
the
taste
makes
up
for
this
though
its
a
bit
sweet
chocolate
molasses
and
brown
sugar
dominate
the
taste
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
night
this
will
warm
you
up
another
hit
for
cigar
city
drinkability
the
alcohol
makes
itself
known
in
this
brew
overall
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
does
pack
a
punch
d
great
brown
very
easy
to
drink
63rd
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
end
my
long
day
with
i
feel
like
brown
ales
get
a
bad
wrap
becuase
they
rarely
wow
people
but
i
would
say
that
this
was
a
great
version
of
the
style
if
you
come
across
this
or
get
a
chance
to
trade
for
it
id
say
go
for
it
becuase
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
the
ccb
line
up
draft
pours
a
clear
darker
reddish
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
nutty
dark
malt
aroma
in
the
nose
along
with
some
cerealbread
notes
with
a
touch
of
cocoa
good
lace
left
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
this
down
sweet
chocolate
nut
at
the
start
balanced
with
a
nice
roast
bitternss
quality
slight
hop
finish
and
ends
rather
dry
medium
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
d
definitely
a
sipper
because
it
is
thick
and
almost
too
boozy
very
enjoyable
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
in
one
sitting
d
not
the
easiest
drinker
in
the
world
but
quite
tasty
and
worth
a
try
for
sure
another
great
offering
from
cigar
city
d
once
again
i
am
absolutely
amazed
by
the
craftsmanship
exhibited
by
ccb
i
normally
dont
indulge
in
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
a
masterpiece
absolutely
worth
checking
out
overall
this
is
still
a
great
beer
seek
it
out
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
beer
probably
one
of
my
biggest
disappoinments
from
cc
funny
it
was
followed
by
one
of
my
biggest
good
surprises
from
cc
anyway
id
say
try
this
if
you
like
other
cc
stuff
just
to
give
their
lineup
a
try
if
you
do
not
like
the
black
licorice
taste
then
avoid
another
great
beer
from
ccb
awesome

bottling
thanks
to
grant
for
bringing
a
growler
of
this
to
one
of
our
gatherings
pours
dark
brown
with
only
a
slight
head
smells
of
tobacco
cocoa
cherry
hoppy
citrus
there
are
notes
of
leather
and
tobacco
on
the
finish
as
well
as
a
light
roastiness
i
love
the
fact
that
these
guys
have
a
house
style
and
that
it
comes
through
so
often
in
their
beers
yet
everything
is
still
so
fresh
and
interesting
the
taste
is
a
nice
combo
of
cherry
tobacco
and
vanilla
progressing
to
notes
of
cocoa
roastiness
and
wet
earth
a
tad
sweet
in
the
mouth
but
the
earthy
notes
help
balance
things
another
nice
beer
from
this
quite
interesting
brewery
f
finishes
pretty
dry
despite
the
initial
sweetness
but
leaves
some
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
as
well
as
syrupy
slight
stickiness
then
more
porter
like
dark
roast
coffee
with
a
little
chewy
malt
lingering
more
creamy
oatmeal
and
very
porter
like
tasty
finish
the
wild
contamination
is
practically
gone
at
this
point
it
started
out
on
the
finish
but
quickly
fades
except
for
the
spicy
dry
finish
that
most
likely
came
from
the
wild
yeast
a
slight
bitterness
comes
through
as
well
despite
the
wild
yeast
contamination
its
delicious
i
can
see
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
and
what
it
is
now
and
both
are
delicious
either
way
i
actually
love
it
the
way
it
is
and
if
they
said
they
did
it
on
purpose
i
would
believe
them
pours
a
nice
rich
muddy
brown
color
with
decent
cap
of
khaki
head
scent
is
of
chocolate
carmel
toffee
roasted
nuts
fresh
bread
taste
is
more
agressive
then
scent
dictates
with
a
nice
big
sweet
chocolate
and
toffee
taste
backed
with
a
solid
roasted
nut
background
perfect
level
of
hopping
medium
bodied
smooth
and
clean
a
very
good
brown
ale
d
a
very
savory
brew
high
abv
which
kind
of
sneaks
up
on
you
as
theres
not
much
heat
from
the
9
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
drinkability
not
too
shabby
the
awkward
tartness
in
the
nose
sort
of
threw
me
think
infection
but
it
didnt
translate
to
the
taste
the
hops
may
be
a
tad
too
much
for
a
nut
brown
but
all
it
all
its
pretty
tasty
thanks
much
joe
drinkability
i
dont
think
that
this
was
the
brett
infected
batch
but
it
has
some
elements
to
it
that
i
wasnt
crazy
about
the
cedar
and
nut
skin
elements
were
negatives
to
my
palate
bolita
was
unexpectedly
fruity
almost
like
some
of
the
belgian
styles
and
delivered
quite
a
bit
more
complexity
than
i
was
expecting
out
of
a
nut
brown
however
after
reading
more
about
the
english
brown
ale
style
it
makes
sense
not
your
typical
brown
ale
but
one
to
sit
back
and
savor
like
all
of
the
cigar
city
beers
i
have
had
this
was
wellcrafted
and
unique
d
i
thought
this
was
a
very
interesting
ale
i
thought
it
was
an
odd
combination
of
smells
and
tastes
but
it
was
still
pleasant
would
try
again
what
stood
out
for
me
about
this
brew
is
the
aromas
and
flavors
burst
with
a
variety
of
nuts
including
walnut
almond
pecan
and
hazelnut
hints
of
earth
and
alcohol
and
just
an
undeniable
presence
throughout
the
finish
is
dry
and
not
without
hops
really
a
fine
beer
as
long
as
you
share
it
drinkability
for
this
one
is
near
perfect
like
a
beautifully
put
together
dark
chocolate
bar
with
hazlenuts
and
coffee
beans
only
the
very
light
alcohol
keeps
this
from
a
perfect
5
in
this
category
d
this
was
really
cedary
but
it
worked
better
in
this
beer
than
it
did
for
the
cedaraged
zhukov
everything
was
well
harmonized
and
delicious
a
great
offering
drinkability
too
damn
strong
for
what
id
call
an
english
style
brown
ale
something
i
should
be
able
to
drink
in
fairly
large
quantities
and
not
find
myself
feeling
buzzed
yeah
ive
had
strong
esbas
before
and
thought
the
same
thing
about
them
but
this
particular
beer
combined
with
the
strange
tartness
brings
the
drinkability
down
big
time
im
super
happy
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
but
it
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
drink
in
a
pint
glass
at
chilled
level
overall
tasty
had
the
ba
version
and
happy
to
have
tried
the
regular
which
i
actually
prefer
d
likable
drink
a
pleasing
sipper
that
ended
a
relaxed
wednesday
evening
subtle
warmth
goes
to
the
head
a
little
too
noticeably
but
an
otherwise
fine
nightcap
glad
to
have
a
second
bottle
thanks
to
fine
florida
ba
sebastien
d
excellent
ccb
has
taken
this
style
to
a
whole
new
level
poured
from
a
large
bottle
into
an
ommegang
glass
cloudy
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
the
double
nut
gives
it
more
body
thickness
to
the
beer
superb
flavors
mollases
spice
the
nuttyness
of
course
and
a
nice
finish
hard
to
get
but
i
live
close
to
the

second
pouring
from

ml
was
quite
muddy
actually
nutty
and
toasted
aroma
slight
lactic
or
sour
tinge
to
it
beefy
malt
upfront
with
quite
a
pronounced
nuttiness
and
woody
flavor
lingering
cocoa
notes
again
has
a
lactic
twang
going
on
grainy
tasting
decent
enough
body
overall
an
ok
beer
double
brown
doesnt
strike
me
as
an
easy
style
to
pull
off
would
rather
try
some
other
cigar
city
beers
going
forward
drinkabilty
the
mouthfeel
and
the
abv
are
a
bit
of
a
challenge
but
i
think
i
could
get
through
a
750ml
myself
d
strong
flavor
profile
would
limit
but
it
hides
the
9
well
i
think
this
was
a
great
beer
and
another
winner
by
ccb
hoping
i
make
it
to
tampa
at
some
point
to
check
these
guys
out
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
roasted
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
light
english
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
very
rich
crystal
malt
flavor
along
with
some
mild
hops
and
a
bit
of
esters
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
and
provides
a
bit
of
heat
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
cant
say
that
ive
had
too
many
imperial
brown
ales
that
said
i
feel
this
would
be
a
fine
example
of
the
style
reviewed
on

bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
nuts
light
roasted
malt
caramel
malt
and
light
fruits
apple
fig
flavor
has
a
nice
smokeyoaky
edge
with
roasted
nuts
roasted
malt
smoked
apple
and
maybe
a
touch
of
coffee
i
like
the
smoked
aspect
of
this
beer
very
tasty
robust
palate
and
creamy
too
however
it
gets
slightly
wearing
and
a
little
acidic
as
you
go
through
the
beer
overall
a
brown
ale
i
actually
enjoyed
d
scary
smooth
for
9
i
am
really
enjoying
this
one
and
im
glad
my
first
ccb
beer
has
turned
out
to
be
a
winner
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
styles
from
this
brewery
and
would
recommend
this
one
no
doubt
about
it
another
nice
big
bold
cigar
city
brew
much
enjoyed
i
genuinely
enjoyed
the
nose
i
really
did
the
palate
otoh
is
a
bit
of
an
infected
mess
right
now
with
some
of
the
rich
chocolate
toffee
and
nutty
sweetness
clashing
rather
poorly
with
the
mild
funk
thats
grassy
with
wet
hay
despite
all
the
negativity
here
im
really
digging
the
malt
complexity
in
this
beer
and
would
love
to
try
an
uninfected
version
of
this
beer
drying
on
the
finish
with
some
nougat
and
chocolate
this
is
solid
carbonation
is
a
little
high
for
such
a
big
brown
ale
but
thats
probably
due
to
the
infection
the
body
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
and
compliments
the
flavors
quite
well
sourness
is
low
its
more
funk
than
sour
not
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
but
i
drank
about
half
the
bottle
which
isnt
bad
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
tan
head
with
some
nice
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is

the
taste
is

lots
of

going
on
slight

medium

very
nice
slight

finish
you
would
never
know
this
was

brew
very
drinkable
an
awesome
brew
highly
recommended
medium

with
a
lot
of
smokey
roasted

notes

a

taste
is
the
same
with
some
added
roast
and
some
barley
somewhere
in
the
medium
area
carb
is
nice
and
the
alcohol
is
out
of
the
way
i
had
no
idea
this
was
9
till
i
looked
i
thought
it
was
in
the
6
area
a
nice
strong
brown
that
does
not
stray
far
at
all
from
the
style
at
best
this
is
a
somewhat
better
then
average
brown
ale
cant
imagine
why
id
want
to
order
this
beer
again
this
is
a
good
brown
edit
upon
examining
this
beer
a
little
more
i
get
some
vinegar
and
wild
funky
notes
i
really
didnt
expect
this
but
in
reality
it
is
quite
obvious
not
something
i
like
very
much
coming
from
the
style
i
gotta
take
the
drinkilibilty
down
a
bit
because
i
just
dont
feel
it
drinkability
another
world
class
beer
from
cc
so
far
everything
i
had
from
them
has
been
fabulous
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
tight
tan
colored
head
that
settled
into
a
chunky
ring
the
aroma
is
of
mocha
and
milk
chocolate
wet
wood
and
pepper
the
taste
is
big
on
the
milk
chocolate
and
mocha
light
roasted
malt
some
smoke
and
nut
flavors
has
to
be
one
of
the
tastiest
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
nice
moderate
body
with
semisoft
carbonation
give
the
brew
a
silky
feel
sweet
yet
with
a
bitter
edge
perhaps
a
touch
sticky
in
the
end
abv
well
hidden
this
is
a
mighty
fine
brew
big
and
bold
for
a
brown
but
very
drinkable
a
great
brew
here
good
to
see
more
brews
flowing
from
florida
now
i
just
need
to
get
my
hands
on
them
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
certainly
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
a
long
time
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
beer
is
an
excellent
beer
but
this
one
is
no
slouch
either
i
got
a
bottle
of
the
ba
bolita
to
age
and
actually
i
should
have
got
another
one
of
these
too
a
very
complex
and
interesting
brown
ale
very
tasty
md
palate
is
fairly
light
for
the
abv
adding
to
the
drinkability
you
really
dont
notice
the
9
at
all
this
is
a
great
beer
750ml
bottle
shared
by
mfielden
recently
thanks
mark
dark
hazy
brown
appearance
with
two
fingers
of
tan
head
that
retains
well
an
attractive
brown
ale
nutty
malty
toasty
aroma
nice
but
honestly
a
bit
muted
for
a
9
beast
of
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
inexplicably
mellow
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
i
would
guess
that
this
was
a
standard
5
brown
ale
whether
thats
a
good
or
bad
thing
im
not
sure
but
im
impressed
with
how
deceptive
it
is
how
does
it
actually
taste
then
nice
but
very
basic
toasted
grain
and
nuts
light
roastiness
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
the
finish
smooth
from
the
oats
but
perhaps
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
the
style
the
finish
is
dry
and
yeasty
with
a
mild
lingering
roastiness
pretty
good
stuff
one
of
the
better
cigar
city
beers
ive
tried
so
far
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
the
other
treatments
but
still
a
great
beer
this
dark
brown
ale
had
an
enticing
aroma
with
very
little
head
as
we
poured
it
for
a
small
group
tasting
in
bellport
last
night
the
big
bodied
ale
appeared
to
be
very
dense
in
the
glassware
and
the
first
taste
further
explained
the
commotion
around
its
arrival
in
my
area
it
had
a
very
enjoyable
taste
that
one
could
pick
out
a
variety
of
stronger
ale
notes
such
as
elements
of
coffee
smoke
bourbon
and
caramel
the
dry
chalky
aftertaste
also
reminded
me
of
cocoa
bars
and
i
thought
a
little
partagas
cigar
might
go
well
with
this
ale
overall
a
nice
double
brown
and
very
enjoyable
wasnt
disappointed
with
this
brew
really
nice
d
bolita
isnt
a
beer
that
you
are
going
to
drink
all
night
long
but
it
is
a
very
complex
and
tasty
sipper
that
seems
like
it
would
be
the
perfect
beer
pairing
with
a
cigar
overall
yet
another
fantastic
brew
from
cigar
city
keep
em
coming
guys
very
excited
to
find
this
bottled
d
wow
this
is
a
thick
rich
malty
beer
that
has
enough
hop
presence
in
the
finish
to
balance
and
keep
it
drinkable
i
dont
really
get
much
nuttiness
from
the
malt
but
the
surprisingly
dark
chocolate
and
tobacco
notes
are
better
anyway
not
exactly
a
session
beer
but
pretty
drinkable
nonetheless
a
complex
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
huge
here
it
dosent
at
all
feel
like
a
9
brew
overall
yet
another
top
notch
offering
from
ccb
kudos
again
to
joey
and
wayne
skal
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
with
a
decent
sized
creamy
medium
tan
head
which
slowly
fades
with
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
a
deliciously
sweet
maltiness
strong
molasses
sugary
caramel
toffee
and
some
cola
as
well
a
bit
of
woodiness
and
dark
ripe
fruit
too
taste
follows
and
lives
up
to
the
aroma
big
malty
beer
sweet
caramel
and
sugary
toffee
mixes
with
some
nutty
and
earthy
qualities
molasses
in
the
finish
big
and
creamy
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
hoppiness
balances
with
a
slight
peppery
feel
on
the
tongue
and
a
very
nice
dryness
in
the
finish
very
good
brown
the
alcohol
is
well
balanced
and
it
drinks
way
too
easy
for
a
9
beer
delicious
and
sweet
hope
this
one
gets
bottled
some
day
one
of
the
few
browns
that
i
would
definitely
keep
in
the
cellar
big
thanks
to
jay
for
the
sample
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
things
for
a
brown
ale
and
ive
probably
describe
this
one
more
as
an
imperial
brown
than
a
traditional
english
brown
either
way
its
tasty
and
ive
enjoyed
both
the
brown
ales
ive
had
from
ccb
overall
this
is
a
very
good
imperial
brown
that
melds
a
bunch
of
flavors
together
very
well
certainly
worth
a
shot
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
i
have
had
di
which
i
had
ordered
a
second
instead
of
the
ipa
that
ordered
when
my
food
came
i
also
cant
wait
until
ccb
starts
bottling
the
bolita
brown
so
i
can
take
it
back
home
with
me
this
brown
ale
pours
a
nice
comforting
deep
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
aromas
are
of
warm
malts
fruity
esters
and
a
hint
of
cantaloupe
mouth
feel
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
creamy
and
substantial
roasty
slightly
sweet
malts
dominate
the
flavor
with
hints
of
almonds
and
pecans
and
just
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
at
the
finish
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
ale
and
a
definite
must
try
if
youre
looking
for
worthy
brews
from
florida
pours
clear
but
quite
dark
brown
thinner
tanish
head
after
letting
it
sit
out
for
a
short
while
i
get
toffee
on
the
nose
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
minor
roasted
and
coffee
tones
but
the
sweet
character
stays
dominant
here
feel
has
a
pretty
vibrant
carbonation
on
there
and
the
liquid
is
thicker
on
the
body
this
is
a
pretty
thick
beer
brown
ale
sure
i
guess
seems
like
an
imperial
brown
ale
if
you
ask
me
thick
and
hearty
not
a
traditional
interpretation

nice
ale
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
the
fact
i
can
see
it
as
an
excuse
for
the
next
few
weeks
of
a
sudden
it
was
the
best
of
the
day
before
i
get
a
follow
back
on
my
way
home
from
work
to
be
the
first
half
of
the
year
and
i
dont

that
i

to
go

i
dont
great

head

nice

coffee

cocoa
taste
is
also
nice

flavors
of
expresso
and
chocolate
are
less
pronounced
finish
is
smooth
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
hints
of
nuttiness
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
experienced
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
a
little
thin
in
my
opinion
but
then
i
like
chewy
beers
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
too
but
then
that
might
be
another
way
of
saying
i
like
heavy
chewy
beers
definite
coffee
caramel
and
malt
with
maybe
some
raisins
or
prunes
in
the
background
another
one
in
the
plus
column
for
cigar
city
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
with
a
great
coffee
taste
that
doesnt
overpower
a
definite
must
try
taste
is
chocolate
up
front
with
a
burnt
caramel
middle
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
bitterness
mouth
feel
is
largely
a
malt
bomb
with
a
lively
carbonation
had
this
beer
many
times
always
delicious
pours
dark
like
a
stout
and
smells
chocolatey
lots
of
chocolate
flavors
along
with
vanilla
oatmeal
and
toffee
probably
my
favorite
brown
ale
to
date
seriously
like
this
beer
we
have
a
different
label
dont
think
its
the
oatmeal
but
this
is
a
damn
good
brown
ale
very
sexy
low
level
of
carbonation
keeps
it
smooth
but
still
enough
to
leave
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
good
tasting
beer
easy
to
drink
another
nice
one
from
cigar
city
nice
tasting
if
a
tad
thin
ale
nice
bitterness
and
hints
of
spices
overshadow
the
oatmeal
flavors
glad
i
have
more
pours
out
an
opaque
brown
with
a
rich
creamy
long
lasting
head
significant
lacing
throughout
the
taste
and
aroma
are
of
rich
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
and
toffee
the
finish
is
quite
clean
the
feel
is
slightly
thin
but
not
enough
to
detract
from
the
fine
flavor
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
brown
ale
that
i
will
buy
many
times
and
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
this
style
a
little
high
in
alcohol
for
a
session
beer
but
a
couple
wont
knock
you
out
either
my
favorite
brown
ale
for
sure
out
of
a
can
into
a
plastic
cup
at
a
booth
in
epcot
virtually
no
head
but
a
nice
dark
brown
color
very
nice
taste
and
smell
solid
brown

you
may
not

your

on

but
you
can
easily
get
your

on
a

brown
and
why
not
this
is
well
worth
drinking
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
a
light
approachable
take
on
a
style
that
is
usually
a
lot
less
palatable
im
not
sure
how
often
ill
buy
it
but
im
glad
its
out
there
a

hit

the

most

is

overall
really
nice
malty
brown
ale
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
simply
a
great
ale
brown
or
otherwise
poured
dark
brown
in
color
with
slight
ruby
highlights
no
head
whatsoever
that
left
no
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
a
combination
of
grains
and
brown
sugar
were
noticeable
upfront
in
the
nose
alongside
hidden
coffee
mild
sugar
and
traces
of
vanilla
the
brown
sugar
character
is
just
as
potent
on
the
palate
with
oatmeal
grain
flavor
and
a
touch
of
coffee
the
brew
was
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
very
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
malty
finish
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
o
good
doesnt
blow
me
away
a
bit
too
thin
in
feel
poured
from
a
can
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
with
lingering
notes
of
coffee
malts
and
chocolate
easily
enjoyable
in
any
setting
where
caramelized
malts
that
are
roundeed
out
with
hints
of
tobacco
and
leather
are
desired
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
wonderfully
sessionable
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
malt
backbone
overall
a
real
gem
for
a
style
that
doesnt
get
much
respect
probably
one
of
the
best
browns
ive
ever
had
pretty
good
british
brown
although
i
do
seem
to
pick
up
a
bit
of
tartness
that
doesnt
belong
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
modest
lite
brown
foamy
thick
head
that
soon
all
but
disappears
and

almost

very
fragrant

are
about
perfect

is
like
flavor
has
a
few
medicinal
qualities
that
linger
and
is
overall
very
drinkable

not
too
sweet

not

the

holds
more
barley

even
lighter

and
some

the
flavor
was
a
tinge
weak
with
a
wateriness
that
pushed
into
the
feel
the
moderate
carbonation
adds
a
smooth
feel
but
the
wateriness
detracts
a
bit
rjt
oa
really
good
brown
ale
the
only
real
drawback
is
that
it
was
a
tad
watery
fluffy

which
diminishes
relatively
quickly

leaves

brown

with
a

feel
due
to
the
additional
of
oatmeal
pours
deep
brown
with
amber
hues
along
the
outside
of
the
glass
when
held
up
to
a
light
source
the
head
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
with
very
little
retention
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
haha
wow
as
soon
as
i
smelled
this
one
i
totally
got
the
artwork
on
the
can
tons
of
tobacco
and
cigar
box
on
the
nose
truly
amazing
actually
dates
and
figs
are
also
present
in
the
nose
a
bit
of
smokiness
sweet
and
earthy
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
a
big
mouthful
of
dark
chocolate
a
hint
of
espresso
tobacco
leaves
very
earthy
and
enjoyable
no
hops
in
the
mix
what
so
ever
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
not
complaining
but
i
wouldnt
be
bummed
if
they
beefed
up
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
carbonation
is
light
and
perfect
for
the
style
overall
i
was
totally
blown
away
by
this
one
not
expecting
much
especially
after
the
underwhelming
appearance
and
it
was
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
so
earthy
and
sweet
just
like
a
fine
cigar
is
this
a
dark
brown
ale
or
a
light
porter
i
honestly
dont
have
enough
experience
with
the
style
to
say
i
have
enough
experience
with
madurowrapped
cigars
to
say
that
this
beer
doesnt
particularly
remind
me
of
one
however
i
imagine
it
would
pair
quite
well
with
a
good
dark
cigar
or
dessert
andor
dinner
for
that
matter
o
underwhelming
to
me
it
tasted
good
but
the
flavors
alone
are
not
enough
to
carry
this
brew
o
maduro
is
a
solid
brown
after
all
the
hype
on
this
one
i
wanted
to
like
it
a
lot
more
than
i
did
it
seems
flat
and
not
as
distinct
as
it
was
in
my
head
it
had
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
buried
rusty
glow
and
an
inch
of
off
white
head
that
disappears
instantly
and
does
not
come
back
sitting
flat
in
my
glass
after
just
a
minute
the
nose
is
probably
the
best
feature
its
dry
caramel
forward
english
malt
and
a
lathery
chocolate
body
with
burnt
sugar
and
slight
smoke
notes
the
flavor
hits
on
all
of
these
but
they
just
dont
come
together
into
a
cohesive
experience
for
me
im
not
getting
the
nutty
tobacco
or
coffee
notes
everyone
else
seems
to
find
in
this
i
just
get
chocolate
malt
and
an
earthy
soil
element
i
like
it
dont
get
me
wrong
but
this
didnt
blow
my
doors
off
maybe
ill
have
to
try
it
a
little
closer
to
the
source
not
sure
how
well
this
traveled
to
colorado
not
quite
enough
carbonation
a
little
thin
on
the
body
and
not
as
drinkable
or
unique
as
i
imagined
maybe
a
victim
of
my
own
expectations
on
this
one
o
3

this
beer
has
a
good
blend
of
all
the
flavors
going
on
its
nothing
i
would
see
out
but
i
would
have
it
again
nice
very
smooth
very
understated
and
consistent
to
the
point
it
could
be
overlooked
for
cigar
citys
other
outstanding
brews
dark
mahogany
with
basically
little
to
no
head
and
average
smell
but
the
flavor
is
amazing
lower
abv
as
well
so
while
not
quite
a
session
could
have
a
few
and
none
the
wiser
thinner
mouthfeel
as
well
makes
this
a
good
any
season
type
offering
well
done
overall
excellent
brown
ale
that
i
could
drink
all
day
thanks
and
cheers
o
a
simple
yet
solid
brown
ale
its
pretty
straight
forward
but
very
approachable
would
pair
well
with
certain
foods
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
delicious
brew
from
cigar
city
and
definitely
one
to
try
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
but
this
was
more
reminiscent
of
a
porter
or
an
oatmeal
stout
given
its
nature
o
a
pleasant
overall
brown
it
has
an
interesting
nose
and
is
sweet
but
not
overly
overall
good
beer
for
the
style
feels
like
its
been
open
for
an
hour
but
only
10
mins
good
but
not
amazing
thanks
jim
overall
not
a
bad
beer
kind
of
a
mix
of
a
stout
and
a
brown
nothing
too
extreme
of
complex
like
a
strong
chocolate
milk
with
some
coffee
cant
wait
for
ccb
to
open
up
their
distribution
outside
of
florida
too
highly
carbonated
lower
carbonation
might
let
the
flavours
shine
a
bit
more
too
o
this
sounded
pretty
good
but
it
isnt
very
interesting
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
this
seems
darker
than
most
brown
ales
the
aroma
on
this
is
busting
with
toffee
and
espresso
this
is
hands
down
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
loads
of
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
great
aftertaste
everything
you
could
want
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
offering
o
a
light
but
smooth
espresso
toffeechocolate
flavor
with
a
load
of
peanuts
at
the
finish
not
what
i
expected
but
very
enjoyable
o
my
favorite
brown
ive
had
yet
great
qualities
similar
to
a
stout
love
ccb
atmosphere
is
good
large
head
settles
quickly
though
and
no
real
lacing
nose
is
full
of
character
coffee
malt
with
sweet
notes
fall
spice
and
chocolate
oaty
and
grainy
roasted
coffee
malt
with
a
little
dark
chocolate
with
a
pungent
finish
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
its
a
very
refreshing
brown
ale
that
packs
a
lot
of
flavour
and
aroma
a
very
similar
profile
to
a
good
porter
like
edmund
fitzgerald
or
black
butte
but
the
beer
is
on
the
thinner
side
and
incredibly
quaffable
its
like
you
crossed
the
flavouraroma
profile
of
edmund
fitzgerald
with
the
body
and
drinkability
of
an
aal
i
like
this
one
a
lot
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
when
they
first
started
making
it
o
i
loved
this
not
bitter
in
the
least
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
an
great
brew
that
i
would
certainly
have
again
given
the
flavor
balance
and
mouthfeel
it
seems
like
the
type
of
brew
you
could
enjoy
at
anytime
meal
sporting
event
etc
goodness
after
enjoying
this
beer
for
over
a
year
im
finally
reviewing
it
sipping
from
the
can
at
the
moment
however
i
know
this
beer
has
a
fantastic
hazy
brown
color
it
smells
heavily
of
toffee
and
chocolate
with
a
good
amount
of
caramel
and
coffee
the
taste
is
mainly
the
toffee
closely
followed
by
coffee
and
then
the
roasted
malts
what
really
makes
this
beer
for
me
is
the
mouthfeel
superbly
creamy
i
cant
recall
if
they
actually
employ
oats
in
the
brewing
process
but
it
certainly
feels
like
it
maduro
coats
the
tongue
and
mouth
and
i
love
that
about
it
no
homo
6
pk
for
7
49
fail
overall
this
is
a
really
good
brown
a
little
too
dry
for
my
taste
but
the
flavor
is
great
i
suppose
that
comes
with
the
territory
of
an
eba
though
in
any
event
it
kicks
the
tail
out
of
newcastle
overall
this
is
decent
enough
but
too
carbonated
ill
try
it
again
some
time
in
a
smoother
form
where
im
sure
it
will
be
rather
pleasant
overall
nice
beer
for
sure
i
can
see
why
its
a
popular
regular
offering
it
could
be
a
touch
creamier
perhaps
especially
for
an
oatmeal
ale
but
this
is
a
flavorful
and
enjoyable
brew
love
me
some
ccb
cheers
bring
overall
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
and
it
smelled
like
a
hefeweizen
and
drank
like
a
stout
od
very
much
a
well
put
together
brown
ale
doesnt
knock
the
ball
out
of
the
park
but
it
does
what
it
intends
to
do
very
well
highly
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
overall
a
real
tasty
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
would
be
phenomenal
to
pair
with
a
cigar
overall
for
a
style
that
isnt
my
fav
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
could
see
myself
easily
putting
back
a
bunch
of
these
around
the
campfire
overall
i
had
heard
that
this
was
a
beer
to
seek
out
while
in
fl
it
definitely
didnt
disappoint
it
was
fun
to
drink
and
went
well
with
food
a
big
burger
fords
garage
in
ft
myers
fl
i
will
look
for
this
again
while
in
florida
poured
a
brownish
body
with
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
and
left
some
lace
aroma
hit
several
minor
notes
of
caramel
bitter
chocolate
toffee
coffee
some
roasted
malts
touchs
of
other
sugar
sweetness
and
a
tad
of
grainy
hops
or
breadiness
something
akin
to
those
but
nothing
spectacular
taste
of
the
beer
is
more
of
the
same
while
it
is
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
drying
sensation
on
the
finish
there
is
nothing
spectacular
about
the
beer
there
is
a
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
dry
roasted
malts
as
well
as
a
touch
of
hops
but
i
really
cant
say
this
beer
is
too
sweet
or
has
a
peculiar
drynessbreadinesshopiness
to
it
to
classify
it
as
something
else
a
good
beer
but
one
that
for
me
at
least
is
just
slightly
under
par
with
some
other
better
brown
alesoatmeal
stouts
which
i
really
didnt
get
any
taste
or
feel
of
oats
although
it
would
explain
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
57
had
this
beer
on
tap
smooth
finish
the
chocolate
and
the
roasted
components
are
very
well
balanced
you
can
taste
the
oats
in
the
after
taste
the
color
is
okay
and
had
a
decent
head
to
it
overall
its
pretty
good
tastes
great
so
far
cigar
city
hasnt
failed
to
impress
overall
excellent
beer
perhaps
a
great
dessert
beer
but
i
can
drink
this
on
any
occasion
its
not
a
session
beer
but
its
one
of
my
favorite
just
to
have
as
a
standalone
between
this
and
the
rogue
hazelnut
i
have
been
fully
converted
to
loving
brown
ales
the
oatmeal
aspect
of
it
i
did
not
really
notice
d
easy
to
drink
while
5
5
abv
its
on
the
higher
end
of
abvs
for
the
style
pours
a
dark
sherry
brown
hue
with
a
creamy
one
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
sherryoakchestnuts
and
a
touch
of
chocolatethe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
and
has
tastes
of
chocolateroasted
nutstobaccooak
and
finished
with
a
toffee
bittersweetness
and
overall
its
easy
to
drink
but
could
have
a
fuller
feel
cheers
overall
i
usually
love
cigar
city
but
i
am
not
wowed
by
this
one
the
other
cans
in
this
sixer
were
all
nice
but
i
am
not
getting
as
much
flavor
from
this
one
it
is
good
flavor
but
just
really
diminished
a
superior
brown
ale
recommended
for
both
florida
vacations
and
home
consumption
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
outside
the
box
brown
ale
i
would
drink
this
again
in
a
second
and
seek
it
out
a
really
great
brown
ale
its
hard
to
come
by
an
impressive
one
but
this
and
ellies
brown
ale
by
avery
are
my
top
2
i
think
bottom
line
i
would
buy
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
was
available
overall
a
good
robust
brown
ale
flavorful
enough
to
satisfy
light
and
clean
enough
to
refresh
o
cigar
city
could
have
called
this
an
oatmeal
porter
and
i
wouldnt
have
batted
an
eyelash
thats
a
compliment
its
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
a
quick
drinker
but
its
richness
belies
its
5

abv
would
make
a

beer

thanks
to

thanks
man
soft
brown
color
with
a
quickly
disappating
head
aroma
is
ok
mostly
malt
and
a
touch
of
sugar
flavor
is
about
the
same
decent
beer
but
nothing
id
go
seeking
out
a
second
time
still
i
was
thankful
to
get
the
opportunity
to
tick
this
very
tasty
and
well
worth
what
i
paid
for
the
6
pack
overall
mouthfeel
isnt
great
but
it
has
a
taste
that
keeps
it
interesting
throughout
the
glass
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
with
some
many
other
great
beers
out
there
overall
a
little
more
hopped
then
im
used
to
but
had
a
pretty
good
balance
in
both
flavor
and
mouthfeel
overall
good
nice
rendition
of
the
style
not
a
thrilling
beer
but
flavourful
and
something
that
you
could
readily
drink
quite
a
lot
of
a
bit
disappointing
for
a
brown
ale
maduro
brown
ale
is
a
surprisingly
dry
and
effervescent
dark
ale
thats
focused
in
its
toasty
taste
aroma
and
texture
delicious
and
effortless
on
the
palate
ideal
for
nutty
parmesean
slices
or
softer
earthen
cigars
o
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
by
ccb
but
its
at
least
a
nice
and
sessionable
brown
ale
d
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
brown
ale
from
cigar
city
it
has
nice
complexity
and
a
really
nice
interplay
between
the
different
flavors
i
would
love
to
try
some
of
the
other
variations
of
this
beer
but
just
being
able
to
try
this
base
version
makes
me
happy
enough
bottled
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
pretty
brown
clear
with
red
light
throughout
and
1
finger
tan
head
with
good
retention
fluffy
nice
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
malts
on
the
front
palate
with
espresso
tobacco
earthy
hops
on
the
middle
and
very
toasted
peanuts
or
burnt
bread
at
the
back
end
moderate
body
modlow
carbonation
a
bit
thinwet
mouthfeel
a
fantastic
brown
has
great
drinkability
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smell
is
not
quite
what
id
expect
from
a
brown
ale
its
got
that
sweet
caramel
malt
presence
but
also
a
good
amount
of
dark
fruit
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
not
quite
as
wellintegrated
flavor
incorporates
that
fruitiness
from
the
aroma
in
a
mellow
way
and
combines
it
with
some
nuttiness
and
roasted
malt
its
unique
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
its
sweeter
and
less
bitter
than
most
brown
ales
mouthfeel
is
thinmedium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
but
a
little
too
thin
for
the
sytle
overall
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
brown
ale
that
works
fairly
well
its
not
a
great
beer
but
its
certainly
a
good
one
a
good
tasting
brown
beer
with
a
nutty
flavor
nicely
hopped
and
fairly
low
abv
decent
beer
for
drinking
and
enjoying
with
food
but
not
highly
remarkable
o
typical
run
of
the
mill
brown
ale
maybe
a
bit
sweeter
than
others
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
one
but
i
was
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
its
nice
to
see
someone
take
a
basic
style
and
knock
it
out
of
the
park
i
dont
typically
seek
out
browns
but
i
will
after
stumbling
upon
this
one
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
o
technically
not
sessionable
at
5

this
is
still
the
kind
of
brown
ale
you
could
drink
all
night
there
profile
is
solid
slightly
sweet
delicious
on
the
front
end
and
the
back
lots
of
roasted
nutty
goodness
great
brown
ale
offering
up

ellies
for

beer
dated

are
the
hops
gone
after
6
months
very
much
more
on
the
english
side
of
things
no
citrus
here
and
some
interesting

too
fizzy
and
a

too
bitey
thanks

o
excellent
brown

great
balanced
brew
o
i
did
not
finish
this
beer
five
sips
and
i
was
done

pours
a
deep
darker
brown
amber
topped
with
a
two
finger
cream
colored

biscuity
and
nutty
on

opens
with

hints
of

and
biscuity
yeast
and
finishes
with
roasted
nuts
including
hints
of
cashew
peanuts
and
almond
medium
body
smooth
and
a
pleasant
level
of
gentle
carbonation
one
of
the
better
american
brewed
english
brown
ales
i
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
from
a
bottle
before
they
started
canning
this
one
smells
of
chocolate
and
looks
the
part
with
a
dark
brown
color
creamy
cream
colored
head
taste
follows
with
mostly
chocolate
some
nice
nuttyness
and
a
clean
light
finish
a
little
bite
this
is
a
thinner
brown
ale
than
i
have
had
before
but
it
doesnt
sacrifice
the
flavor
for
the
drinkability
a
good
brew
that
goes
well
in
summer
or
winter
time
overall
great
from
the
bottle
i
suspect
outstanding
on
draft
the
odd
in
a
good
way
smokiness
makes
me
crave
a
cigar
although
i
dont
smoke
cigars
o
its
ok
but
really
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
me
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
one
if
my
options
were
limited
at
a
bar
but
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
not
my
favorite
ccb
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
i
dont
think
it
shows
the
malt
complexity
of
the
best
northern
english
brown
ales
for
example
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
but
the
hop
character
must
certainly
appeal
to
a
lot
of
american
drinkers
o
having
had
this
after
the
cubano
espresso
i
probably
didnt
appreciate
this
guy
as
much
a
nice
soft
drinking
brown
ale
that
pairs
well
with
a
good
burger
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
wish
their
beers
were
available
where
i
live
o
very
solid
brown
ale
not
too
sweet
but
great
flavor
final
thoughts
definitely
not
the
best
brown
ale
out
there
it
would
probably
go
well
with
a
cigar
as
there
isnt
enough
flavor
here
to
really
make
it
stand
on
its
own
overall
an
excellent
brown
ale
highly
recommended
the
tan
head
disappears
very
quickly
after
the
pour
with
minimal
lacing
color
is
a
deep
reddishbrown
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
the
carbonation
was
too
high
for
my
liking
especially
for
this
style
of
beer
i
wanted
to
smoothly
savor
the
roastyness
of
this
beer
but
the
carbonation
level
interfered
with
this
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
great
one
either
i
was
excited
to
try
a
cigar
city
beer
while
vacationing
in
south
florida
but
this
offering
was
a
bit
disappointing
an
hour
later
the
carbonation
settled
the
tang
and
effervescent
disappeared
score
reflects
that
flavor
and
aroma
and
body
appearance
not
head
o
an
unfortunate
bottling
error
with
the
carbonation
leaves
this
brew
with
a
relatively
muteddull
flavor
profile
o
overall
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
beer
really
like
the
almost
stoutporter
qualities
this
beer
has
very
tasty
eric
drinkability
high
with
only
5
5
abv
i
can
see
putting
back
quite
a
few
of
these
at
a
sitting
odi
enjoyed
this
one
if
i
could
get
this
regularly
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
a
lot
i
could
see
this
going
perfectly
in
several
different
scenarios
would
pair
well
with
a
ton
of
food
too
o
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
needs
to
be
available
in
ohio
this
is
very
complex
and
easily
one
of
the
best
browns
i
have
had
by
the
way
do
as
the
label
says
try
this
with
a
cigar
bliss
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
nutty
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
in
my
opinion
overall
a
brew
that
is
an
exquisite
representation
of
this
style
with
the
oats
giving
it
a
nice
smooth
creamy
feel
and
a
great
drinkability
most
definitely
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
tasted
to
date
ooverall
this
is
a
good
malty
brown
ale
if
you
like
bown
alesbrown
ales
are
not
my
favorite
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
good
beer
it
is
worth
giving
it
a
try
if
you
never
had
it
ive
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
cigar
city
o
it
started
out
good
then
came
that
burnt
popcorn
taste
maybe
this
is
old
im
not
sure
why
i
got
that
taste
i
had
better
try
another
damn
enjoyable
beer
nice
1
finger
tan
color
head
nice
deep
brown
with
a
red
tint
color
easy
to
drink
not
thick
at
all
tasted
a
tad
strong
towards
malty
ness
but
that
was
expected
nice
after
taste
overall
a
quality
and
much
enjoyed
beer
6
pack
was
not
enough
cigar
citys
classic
brown
ale
here
in
miami
where
i
live
this
is
a
regular
in
any
good
craft
beer
store
it
is
also
a
regular
in
my
refrigerator
it
is
sessionable
and
delicious
this
is
a
unusual
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
and
complexity
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
to
enjoy
nice
cigar
because
the
flavors
would
compliment
each
other
so
well
for
my
first
cc
beer
i
was
not
disappointed
but
not
overly
impressed
i
look
forward
to
my
next
one
o
a
very
nice
session
brew
served
it
at
my
wedding
with
our
cuban
themed
meal
fit
perfectly
enjoyed
at
the
end
of
the
night
with
a
nice
cigar
highly
recommended
cheers
a
good
brown
ale
with
just
enough
roast
and
grainy
malt
balance
would
definitely
recommend
this
and
have
it
again
when
visiting
ccbs
distribution
area
certainly
doesnt
rank
above
my
favs
smutty
old
brown
dog
sixpoint
brownstone
but
its
a
better
than
normal
brown
ale
with
a
interesting
twist
the
oatmeal
best
brown
ale
ever
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
light
thick
bubbly
head
that
recedes
leaving
clear
glass
behind
smell
is
of
caramel
and
oatmeal
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
very
little
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
active
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
but
not
as
distinctive
as
many
of
their
other
beers
o
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
nice
mix
of
spicyness
and
flavors
i
could
def
see
myself
sitting
down
at
a
smoke
shop
with
one
of
these
in
hand
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
also
smells
dry
good
it
has
a
balanced
feel
to
it
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
by
the
camp
fire
in
the
fall
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
probably
the
whole
greener
grass
thing
from
not
getting
cigar
city
in
my
hometown
but
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
if
not
an
outstanding
one
a
bit
less
than
a
full
finger
of
medium
brown
head
over
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
body
needed
to
hold
up
closely
to
light
to
see
several
streams
of
small
rising
bubbles
nose
is
fairly
complex
some
light
roasted
floor
malt
tobacco
caramel
and
floral
hops
taste
mirrors
nose
easy
drinking
personified
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
effervescence
not
bad
i
need
a
cubano
sandwich
to
fully
enjoy
this
would
be
interested
in
trying
the
more
complex
versions
of
this
base
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
with
a
white
head
and
fair
lacing
a
sweet
aroma
of
caramelized
sugar
oats
and
bready
malt
i
usually
find
the
aroma
of
browns
to
be
lacking
but
found
the
oat
component
really
gave
some
substance
to
this
ones
smell
flavor
is
expectedly
on
the
sweet
side
as
well
with
some
caremalized
brown
sugar
molasses
nutty
some
oatiness
and
the
slightest
touch
of
roastiness
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
slight
carbonation
overalli
love
oatmeal
stouts
and
was
stoked
to
finally
try
this
oatmeal
brown
really
glad
i
didas
it
totally
lived
up
to
and
surpassed
my
expectations
overall
this
was
a
nice
gift
from
the
lady
a
few
months
finally
happy
to
be
enjoying
this
lovely
treat
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
had
a
beer
from
the
brewery
and
am
not
dissapointed
one
bit
wish
i
had
more
o
a
great
brown
ale
mellow
and
sessionable
id
love
to
have
this
on
cask
itd
be
wonderful
o
this
is
a
really
good
english
brown
cigar
city
continues
to
impress
me
the
medium
body
seems
just
right
considering
the
5
5
abv
it
is
easily
palatable
and
quaffable
having
an
almost
gulpable
drinkability
the
carbonation
just
barely
noticeable
doing
little
to
interfere
with
the
flavors
the
swallow
is
a
very
foamy
but
this
only
adds
a
creaminess
at
the
end
malty
aroma
has
notes
of
caramel
and
cinnamon
it
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
a
thick
finebubbled
light
cinnamontan
head
lively
malty
flavor
has
notes
of
cinnamon
cloves
and
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
horehound
smooth
fairly
firm
texture
is
a
bit
powdery
and
has
a
good
amount
of
fizz
in
all
honesty
there
are
some
nice
nuances
in
this
beer
theres
an
intriguing
spice
rack
presence
which
is
neither
way
offbase
nor
onthemoney
theres
a
little
sweetness
from
the
grains
but
overall
balanced
and
even
slightly
bitter
its
not
a
prize
but
its
a
pretty
decent
example
3
5
sixteen
overall
a
damn
good
brown
ale
more
chocolate
and
roast
than
many
browns
but
overall
it
has
great
balanced
complexity
not
recommended
drink
a
nice
brown
a
bit
unique
even
for
a
base
version
i
would
have
this
one
again
lush
and
semi
creamy
and
presented
with
a
good
layering
in
the
middle
overall
very
smooth
and
pleasant
brown
ale
had
really
expected
more
but
maybe
later
a
try
to
find
out
if
there
really
was
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
medium
bodied
is
the
name
of
the
game
it
isnt
sticky
doesnt
leave
a
film
and
isnt
particularly
drying
when
a
sip
is
taken
it
flows
very
smoothly
allowing
you
to
get
the
flavors
and
refreshes
washing
down
clean

very

almost
black

the

to
pick
out

a

pretty

for
the
most

with
a

this
was
a
great
brown

nice
nutty
taste
balanced
with
a

one
of
the
better
brown

ive
tried
but
probably
not
my
all
time
favorite
easily
drinkable
and
definitely
recommended
would
buy
again
when
im
in
florida
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
low
in
abv
but
big
in
flavor
and
feel
the
nose
wasnt
as
good
as
the
taste
but
the
flavor
made
up
for
the
lack
of
aroma
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
could
possibly
be
my
new
session
beer
give
it
a
whirl
and
taste
for
yourself
cheers
pretty
nice
from
start
to
finish
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
roasted
malts
caramel
faint
coffee
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
flavor
is
light
to
medium
body
sweet
throughout
smooth
and
creamy
and
clean
but
somewhat
dry
in
the
finish
pretty
good
brown
ale
very
sessionable
im
a
newcomer
to
florida
craft
brewing
but
if
this
is
how
they
do
it
down
here
im
a
fan
i
recommend
picking
up
this
brown
it
is
a
very
good
get
o
just
an
average
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
nothing
special
here
overall
i
am
kind
of
stunned
this
has
such
great
reviews
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
so
maybe
it
is
that
good
but
it
seems
very
similar
to
voodoos
brown
ale
with
a
low
abv
wow
a
real
treat
to
drink
only
great
things
about
this
beer
still
very
very
good
but
slightly
better
on
tap
o
really
a
nice
beer
and
worth
a
try
its
very
smooth
and
dark
with
the
malts
never
getting
heavy
or
too
roasty
something
initially
held
me
back
from
giving
it
a
higher
rating
i
think
it
was
the
exceptional
smoothness
it
doesnt
go
over
the
top
anywhere
and
thats
what
a
brown
ale
should
be
imo
coaxed
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
glass
dark
mud
brown
cant
see
through
it
nice
head
that
slowly
sinks
down
carbonation
does
hang
around
though
coffee
hit
right
away
with
chocalte
in
the
background
this
is
a
deep
complex
beer
no
doubt
very
filling
youll
be
dammed
to
finish
the
whole
six
pack
i
m
not
sure
what
to
pair
it
with
cause
it
stands
out
so
much
on
its
own
but
i
guess
a
tbone
would
go
well
with
it
takin
this
one
down
without
a
nice
maduro
cigar
it
pours
a
deep
rubybrown
topped
by
a
finger
at
best
of
sandy
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
coffee
roasted
malts
toasted
bread
cant
pick
out
what
kind
of
bread
though
and
a
touch
of
light
char
the
taste
holds
notes
of
roasted
malts
light
maple
syrup
toasted
caramel
toasted
oats
brown
sugar
and
light
coffee
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
vaguely
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
robust
brown
something
i
wish
i
had
access
to
at
all
times
round
here
good
times
very
inexpensive
beer
with
tremendous
drinkability
the
beer
offers
a
new
experience
in
regards
to
brown
ales
and
i
cant
wait
to
pair
it
with
a
cigar
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
most
people
and
would
love
to
try
it
aged
on
cedar
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
brown
ale
i
like
the
woody
cigarlike
notes
and
i
like
the
brown
sugar
notes
as
well
the
flavor
profile
is
great
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
which
makes
the
flavor
leave
the
palate
a
little
early
overall
a
great
brown
ale
o
easy
drinkability
not
a
lot
going
on
glad
to
try
it
once
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
a
very
nice
brown
ale
certainly
an
aboveaverage
take
on
the
style
great
stuff
id
revisit
any
day
thanks
wayne
o
pretty
good
id
get
it
again
pretty
straight
forward
overall
excellent
brown
ale
very
good
flavor
profile
seek
this
one
outif
this
is
a
stlye
you
like
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
solid
brown
ale
overall
a
good
solid
beer
but
could
have
used
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
dept
its
surprisingly
drinkable
for
what
i
get
out
of
it
in
taste
and
feel
it
seems
like
the
alcohol
should
be
higher
but
its
good
as
is
o
a
really
nice
brew
delicious
pretty
clearly
high
quality
ingredients
big
fan
o
strange
a
very
nice
beer
but
im
having
difficulties
to
call
this
a
brown
ale
my
guess
would
have
been
a
messedup
but
still
a
porter
o
great
work
easily
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
out
there
appearance
of
this
brown
ale
from
ccb
is
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
the
smell
has
chocolate
malts
and
nuts
its
taste
has
raisins
caramel
molasses
and
some
bread
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
a
creamy
texture
this
is
a
very
nice
tasting
brown
ale
a
style
that
i
do
not
frequent
but
this
one
is
worth
your
time
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
the
roast
malt
and
toffee
work
for
me
o
a
good
brown
ale
overall
with
a
nice
mix
of
nutty
and
chocolaty
flavors
and
aromas
its
a
bit
watery
and
doesnt
have
much
depth
but
is
still
tasty
for
a
beer
with
a
relatively
low
abv
oa
potent
example
from
a
respected
southern
brewery
i
bet
the
have
some
delicious
barrel
age
beers
d
drinkability
highly
drinkable
cigar
city
has
added
a
degree
of
excitement
to
an
otherwise
rather
mundane
style
an
excellent
take
on
an
american
brown
ale
o
its
a
funky
example
of
a
brown
i
could
picture
drinking
this
while
chewing
on
a
cohiba
cigar
i
caught
no
banana
esters
or
diacetyl
apple
on
my
bottles
no
signs
of
infection
overall
a
very
funky
darn
brown
its
got
a
great
balance
of
nuttiness
oatmeal
toasted
flavors
and
bite
o
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
it
taste
so
good
and
i
wish
i
could
get
ahold
of
a
lot
more
of
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
just
a
hint
of
red
medium
offwhite
head
scent
is
quite
interesting
not
like
a
typical
brown
ale
i
get
some
distinct
green
apple
and
melon
aromas
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
very
malty
and
a
little
funky
at
the
same
time
taste
is
yep
im
thinkin
i
understand
the
strange
aroma
im
thinkin
this
beer
is
a
bit
infected
initially
i
get
a
slightly
funkytart
green
apple
flavor
immediately
followed
by
some
earthy
hops
then
i
get
some
very
nice
malt
flavors
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
melon
and
tropical
flavors
with
just
a
bit
of
nutty
and
coffee
flavors
at
the
end
if
this
beer
is
infected
i
think
it
should
stay
this
way
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overly
carbonated
kinda
like
club
soda
drinkability
is
high
overall
american
brown
ales
are
not
really
my
thing
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
possible
infection
could
be
key
to
me
liking
this
one
so
much
overall
this
does
not
taste
like
an
american
brown
so
i
cant
reccomend
it
to
someone
who
is
looking
for
that
this
is
plain
mislabeling
however
oh
what
the
hell
im
not
a
bjcp
judge
this
is
a
solid
albeit
weirdass
beer
i
dont
find
any
hops
and
the
abv
is
low
in
and
unnoticeable
the
beer
is
well
crafted
and
tasty
not
super
complex
but
it
is
good
solid
brown
ale
i
would
recommend
this
to
friends
as
a
tasty
malt
lovers
beer
that
you
could
have
a
few
of
in
a
session
thanks
to
hopking311
for
this
one
m
light
to
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
very
smooth
o
4

one
of
the
better
browns
ive
tasted
highly
recommended
especially
for
lovers
of
the
style
light
brown
with
an
orange
hue
to
it
there
was
some
retention
to
the
one
finger
of
beige
head
and
it
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
some
light
cider
to
the
nose
which
is
a
bit
odd
for
this
style
the
upfront
taste
is
bready
but
surprisingly
thin
especially
in
the
finish
this
was
my
first
cigar
city
offering
i
have
heard
positive
things
about
this
brewery
but
this
beer
left
me
a
bit
disappointed
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
quaffable
and
full
of
flavor
bright
and
complex
reminds
me
of
alesmiths
nautical
nut
brown
in
a
way
though
finishing
with
a
bit
more
sweetness
not
a
bad
brown
a
little
sweet
but
pretty
solid
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
ive
had
better
but
this
was
decent
i
could
have
done
with
a
little
less
bitterness
and
a
little
more
body
i
wouldnt
mind
pairing
it
with
a
cigar
like
the
label
suggests
its
probably
strong
enough
to
stand
up
to
one
its
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
serving
type
500ml
glass
o
is
it
my
favorite
ccb
beer
no
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
not
great
plus
it
serves
as
the
backbone
to
several
ccb
offerings
a
must
try
for
the
style
for
sure
eh
its
ok
definitely
tastes
better
than
the
smell
but
very
malt
forward
with
little
oatmeal
character
probably
wont
go
back
to
this
one
overall
i
think
this
a
decent
brown
but
its
not
a
favorite
of
mine
body
is
a
nearly
opaque
brown
color
a
large
2inch
frothy
khaki
colored
head
develops
and
remains
for
some
time
smells
of
alcohol
oats
clove
and
sugar
some
faint
nuts
and
grains
are
detectable
in
the
rear
it
tastes
of
sweet
sugar
grains
faint
hops
various
nuts
oats
and
some
nicely
toasted
malt
in
the
rear
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
with
a
faint
alcohol
bite
towards
the
end
overall
a
great
brown
ale
not
quite
as
good
as
jai
alai
for
certain
but
one
could
do
worse
than
getting
a
bottle
or
two
of
oatmeal
brown
good
steady
overall
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
however
this
comes
at
a
price
it
seems
to
lack
any
real
malty
pop
this
would
not
be
my
first
suggestion
from
cigar
citys
line
of
beers
o
very
subtle
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
darker
malts
are
showcased
very
well
highlighting
brown
sugar
molasses
cocoa
and
earth
a
solid
brown
ale
12oz
bottle
have
had
this
one
a
couple
times
now
it
pours
into
a
glass
a
browish
red
clear
color
with
a
small
head
the
left
quickly
the
smell
is
bitter
sweet
chocolate
with
a
oatmeal
smell
finish
the
taste
is
sweet
on
the
front
with
a
bitter
roasty
almost
coffee
like
after
taste
nicely
balanced
with
a
nice
bitter
after
taste
that
makes
you
want
another
sip
not
too
much
going
on
going
on
in
this
beer
but
it
is
still
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
on
to
the
next
one
cigar
city
is
in
columbus
ga
very
cool
cant
wait
to
try
the
imp
stouts
o
extremely
drinkable
quite
tasty
a
great
brown
ale
pours
a
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
there
is
a
nice
one
finger
tan
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
a
thin
ring
of
head
does
stay
though
smell
is
mostly
roasted
malts
and
nuts
smells
wonderful
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
as
the
smell
just
not
at
robust
i
get
coffee
and
some
kind
of
nut
on
the
taste
there
is
also
minimal
dark
chocolate
coming
through
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
medium
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
brown
ale
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
thicker
mouthfeel
but
that
is
nitpicking
i
am
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
delicious
this
6pack
should
be
gone
within
a
few
days
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
lasts
aroma
of
sweet
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
follows
the
nose
easy
drinking
but
it
has
a
different
mouthfeel
it
almost
leaves
a
film
in
my
mouth
its
still
really
tasty
i
really
like
this
brew
d
very
easy
to
drink
for
sure
great
beer
would
love
to
drink
again
overall
a
nice
competent
malty
brown
ale
its
no
wonder
they
use
it
as
the
base
for
seemingly
hundreds
of
varieties
of
alternations
tweaks
and
addons
overall
very
good
beer
unique
taste
and
flavor
definitly
will
enjoy
this
one
again
overall
very
drinkable
complex
flavors
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
thank
you
miamichael2
for
the
trade
o
havent
had
a
cigar
city
offering
yet
that
wasnt
impressive
many
brown
ales
rely
too
much
on
overbearing
sweetness
this
beer
doesnt
overdo
it
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
this
the
first
cigar
city
beer
ive
had
this
is
a
fine
example
of
their
brewing
i
must
say
cracked
this
bottle
open
and
took
a
whiff
of
this
beers
fine
malty
roasted
nutty
aroma
i
must
add
that
the
taste
is
similiar
to
the
smellbut
smoother
hint
of
treats
of
roasty
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
this
appeared
at
first
to
look
like
a
porter
taste
is
close
to
a
porter
but
is
a
fine
brown
ale
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
ya
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
tastes
less
intense
than
it
smells
but
more
pleasantly
rough
you
got
some
nutty
and
chocolately
nodes
up
front
moving
into
rough
and
lightly
sour
oatmeal
and
bitter
barley
middle
finishing
on
a
lightly
vinous
taste
of
tobacco
caramel
and
peat
moss
fantabulous
taste
is
nice
but
not
spectacular
i
feel
i
bit
flatness
in
this
beer
nothing
really
excels
i
get
a
bit
of
a
watery
mouthfeel
yet
still
drinkable
o
i
dont
know
if
this
is
an
old
bottle
or
if
something
happened
to
it
on
its
journey
to
my
palate
but
its
definitely
not
how
this
beer
was
intended
to
taste
overall
a
very
flavorful
and
well
balanced
brown
ale
of
the
four
cigar
city
beers
ive
had
this
is
the
best
in
my
opinion
a
great
take
on
the
average
brown
ale
overall
my
first
nitrotap
brew
and
it
was
great
maduro
is
a
delicious
complex
brew
cigar
city
never
disappoints
and
they
just
keep
them
coming
cheers
maybe
my
favorite
ccb
beer
so
far
but
i
havent
had
hanuphu
or
cracked
my
marshall
zhukovs
yet
really
nice
delicious
take
on
this
style
thats
somehow
true
to
it
while
being
very
original
at
the
same
time
o
another
wonderful
brew
from
ccb
i
wish
they
distributed
to
colorado
overall
pretty
tasty
brown
ale
would
probably
be
better
if
it
was
smoother
but
not
bad
as
is
its
pretty
decent
not
my
favorite
style
but
would
like
a
bit
more
roastbitter
chocolate
to
balance
the
sweetness
o
we
dont
get
cigar
city
in
wisconsin
so
i
was
pretty
excited
about
this
six
pack
it
turns
out
this
was
not
worth
the
effort
or
the
extra
money
involved
i
tried
a
second
bottle
and
the
results
were
the
same
i
was
still
skeptical
so
i
had
a
few
other
people
sample
this
before
i
completed
the
review
the
results
were
the
same
i
am
admittedly
disappointed
but
i
am
chalking
this
up
to
the
beer
going
bad
and
bad
beer
karma
on
my
part
im
not
sure
what
i
did
to
have
caused
this
bad
beer
karma
but
i
will
proceed
with
caution
in
any
case
i
love
brown
ales
and
would
like
to
try
this
again
im
guessing
it
would
be
better
and
i
would
gladly
add
an
addendum
to
this
review
o
a
really
solid
brown
ale
one
of
my
favorites
in
recent
memory
carbonation
is
fine
body
could
use
a
lift
and
some
girth
a
little
too
light
and
watery

o
solid

with
excellent
character
its
an
okay
beer
but
i
dont
need
more
o
i
would
definitely
get
a
case
of
this
to
share
if
only
it
werent
900
miles
away
o
a
very
solid
beer
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
but
definitely
a
very
good
brew
nice
job
cigar
city
o
very
tasty
and
flavorful
brown
ale
with
contrasting
sweet
followed
by
bitter
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
will
have
many
moreif
i
can
get
some
o
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
its
other
flavored
offerings
but
still
a
very
decent
beer
from
ccb
overall
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brown
im
going
to
give
a
little
bonus
here
because
as
the
brew
warms
up
further
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
taking
on
some
darker
fruitier
characteristics
almost
like
its
heading
for
belgian
territory
d
base
of
beer
is
ok
though
it
feels
somewhat
incomplete
nice
mouthfeel
and
body
any
nuances
were
hidden
by
the
unfortunate
metallic
bitter
flavor
at
end
i
am
not
sure
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
my
bottle
but
i
wonder
i
did
drink
the
whole
bottle
if
there
was
anything
strange
going
on
it
was
minor
m
very
thin
with
a
medium
carbonation
would
like
a
slightly
bigger
mouthfeel
but
feels
okay
overall
this
is
good
for
a
musky
kind
of
brown
i
keep
getting
cigar
in
it
quite
the
coincidence
considering
the
brewer
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
unfortunately
for
cigar
city
there
are
better
brown
ales
out
there
this
is
a
solid
offering
but
it
is
on
the
boring
side
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
there
was
great
flavor
and
it
was
perfectly
balanced
i
would
drink
this
again
cheers
overall
i
love
this
beer
and
cannot
wait
to
try
others
from
ccb
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
really
tasty
brown
a
little
bolder
than
i
like
for
a
brown
ale
but
it
is
so
good
i
dont
hold
that
against
it
i
love
brown
ales
and
i
love
this
brown
ale
like
a
child
its
not
my
sisters
stupid
imaginary
kids
who
are
cute
but
every
one
of
their
flaws
is
a
pain
the
tuches
its
one
of
my
imaginary
kids
in
this
brown
ale
family
and
i
shouldnt
choose
a
favorite
overall
this
may
be
my
second
favorite
brown
first
being
brookyln
brown
i
really
liked
this
one
and
would
like
to
try
more
of
their
other
beers
that
use
this
as
its
foundation
taste
is
up
front
with
malts
the
sweetness
that
the
smell
hinted
at
is
missing
dark
fruits
come
in
somewhere
and
disappear
just
as
quickly
what
sticks
around
is
the
malt
obeing
a
floridian
im
always
glad
when
a
florida
brew
exceeds
my
expectations
and
ccb
has
done
an
excellent
job
at
creating
a
delicious
brown
ale
that
does
just
that
overall
a
great
oatmeal
brown
poured
an
attractive
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
lasted
for
a
good
while
aroma
was
of
bourbon
tobacco
and
caramel
malt
had
a
thinner
mouthfeel
than
i
was
expecting
taste
was
good
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
good
beer
would
definitely
have
again

i
spoke
to
a
friend
who
had
this
on
tap
last
weekend
in
philly
and
he
too
claims
that
it
was
infected
pours
a
rich
brown
color
with
a
yellowish
off
white
head
and
little
lace
aroma
is
malty
with
suggestions
of
candied
pecans
in
the
flavor
robust
maltyness
nutty
and
rich
for
a
brown
ale
this
packs
in
lots
of
flavor
hops
come
accross
oh
so
lightly
just
a
small
wood
note
and
a
distant
earthyness
brown
sugar
roast
oats
and
burnt
caramel
medium
to
full
bodied
feel
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
brown
ale
and
quite
possibly
the
best
ive
come
accross
o
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
as
i
said
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
could
drink
this
one
on
occasion
this
bottle
may
be
in
the
early
stages
of
an
infection
not
sure
as
this
is
my
first
ever
maduro
still
pretty
good
but
there
are
some
off
notes
this
will
soon
be
available
in
georgia
so
when
it
comes
in
i
will
check
one
out
again
and
rerate
if
necessary
overall
pretty
good
not
typically
a
brown
ale
fan
but
i
like
this
one
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
faint
reddish
highlights
when
held
to
light
smallish
off
white
head
dissipates
quickly
to
a
cap
smell
is
kind
of
fruity
with
dark
pitted
fruit
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
slight
earthy
aroma
and
hints
of
chocolate
round
out
the
nose
nicely
taste
is
fruity
and
caramel
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
ethanol
slightly
dry
finish
with
a
lingering
fruity
ethanol
taste
medium
body
ans
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
this
sample
was
certainly
better
than
the
infected
version
but
its
still
an
unremarkable
beer
my
score
will
reflect
this
bottle
o
i
liked
this
one
the
nutty
aftertaste
was
especially
nice
will
drink
again
a
solid
beer
very
sessionable
and
satisfying
medium
body
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
the
flavor
profile
didnt
seem
quite
as
pronounced
as
the
aroma
but
this
was
still
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
in
recent
memory
very
straightforward
brown
that
hits
all
the
appropriate
notes
pretty
good
brew
o
a
good
brown
ale
one
of
the
better
cigar
city
beers
actually
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
browns
that
ive
had
in
some
time
its
good
taste
makes
it
easy
to
drink
worth
picking
up
to
try
sometime
if
you
see
it
around
a
very
tasty
somewhat
sweet
though
well
balanced
brown
ale
id
drink
more
of
it
and
keep
it
stocked
in
my
beer
fridge
if
i
had
access
to
it
o
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
like
the
only
other
cigar
city
beer
ive
had
at
this
point
maduro
tastes
somewhat
unfinished
with
the
mouthfeel
coming
into
its
own
yet
still
creamy
the
aftertaste
lingers
on
and
on
for
quite
some
time
nice
first
experience
with
cigar
city
hoping
my
mom
can
pick
me
up

and
i
felt
the
feel
and
look
to
be
quite
underwhelming
as
well
sigh
ccb
cant
be
perfect
every
time
got
this
on
a
recommendation
from
another
patron
in
the
tasting
room
i
enjoyed
it
drinks
like
a
porter
o
lovely
wish
it
were
year
round
totally
awesome
tasted
just
like
coffee
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
minimal
quickly
disappearing
head
huge
freshly
ground
coffee
aromas
dominate
honestly
thats
all
i
can
find
in
the
aroma
big
coffee
flavors
with
bits
of
caramel
vanilla
ans
chocolate
again
huge
coffee
flavors
dominate
great
beer
flavored
iced
coffee
one
of
the
best
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
great
my
only
complaint
is
the
lack
of
body
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
be
a
lot
better
if
it
had
a
bit
more
body
or
some
viscosity
to
the
mouth
otherwise
it
is
a
solid
and
tasty
brew
fort
myers
fl
easy
drinking
beer
with
an
incredibly
smooth
finish
very
good
balance
with
incredible
finish
good
segway
for
casual
beer
drinkers
into
complex
beers
i
always
get
at
least
one
at
the
brewery
or
tap
house
that
serves
it
when
its
available
interesting
flavor
a
once
in
a
while
beer
o
certainly
a
wellmade
coffee
beer
but
pretty
straightforward
with
no
real
surprises
but
theres
a
lot
to
be
said
for
doing
this
style
well
total
3650
overall
a
very
good
brown
ale
but
i
wouldnt
hunt
this
one
down
unless
you
are
seeking
the
great
aroma
also
interesting
that
the
coffee
is
very
mild
despite
the
can
describing
it
as
dominating
45
o
easily
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
excluding
palo
santo
maroon
which
i
dont
consider
a
brown
ale
definitely
worth
seeking
out
4
5
i
think
the
appearance
and
aroma
of
this
beer
set
it
up
for
failure
i
had
high
expectations
after
each
but
the
body
and
flavor
couldnt
quite
match
its
a
decent
beer
as
i
drink
more
of
this
from
my
growler
the
taste
becomes
ever
so
nice
it
still
is
not
in
the
45
outstanding
but
its
better
than
an
average
beer
also
i
loved
that
ybor
attempted
to
take
a
brown
ale
and
work
it
with
heavy
flavors
does
any
one
else
do
this
or
has
any
one
attempted
to
do
this
so
i
think
they
deserve
a
special
mention
for
being
daring
to
try
and
innovate
the
industry
but
a
45
makes
me
want
to
shout
out
loud
and
share
the
good
news
with
everyone
else
this
beer
did
not
raise
my
shout
out
loud
meter
o
really
well
done
brew
not
overpowering
on
the
cuban
espresso
chocolate
or
cocoa
qualities
that
were
added
but
a
great
creative
concept
got
this
at
whole
foods
near
west
palm
beach
drank
in
deerfield
beach
july
17th
2014
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
tan
head
really
smell
the
coffee
and
hints
of
vanilla
taste
is
similar
not
as
bold
as
i
thought
it
would
be
could
have
been
a
little
better
but
no
complaints
very
tasty
and
refreshing
another
winner
from
ccb
in
my
opinion
nicely
done
and
im
thankful
i
got
to
try
it
o
this
beer
is
outstanding
one
of
the
best
done
coffee
beers
i
have
had
i
would
not
of
expected
a
brown
coffee
ale
to
be
so
complete
but
cigar
city
did
a
great
job
wish
i
could
get
it
in
mi
overall
hands
down
one
of
the
best
coffee
beers
that
ive
ever
had
so
damn
tasty
eric
well
i
certainly
went
into
this
thinking
it
was
a
stout
as
its
a
brown
ale
i
figured
it
would
be
like
comparing
apples
and
smaller
weak
tasting
less
flavorful
apples
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
the
roast
aroma
is
rich
and
rounded
and
becomes
more
so
as
it
warms
if
theres
cocoa
or
vanilla
in
there
its
either
so
subtle
as
to
elude
taste
or
its
balanced
perfectly
with
the
espresso
complementing
and
enhancing
the
coffees
roast
rather
than
overpowering
it
theres
some
toffee
on
the
back
end
but
the
major
player
here
is
wonderfully
wellmade
coffee
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
i
feel
the
mouthfeel
would
benefit
from
a
bit
more
richness
or
perhaps
a
little
less
carbonation
but
then
again
this
seems
to
be
the
norm
for
brown
ales
all
in
all
id
have
this
again
not
right
now
but
tomorrow
good
stuff
bottle
poured
a
medium
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
light
brown
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
strong
dry
coffee
notes
with
some
roasted
notes
and
floral
coffee
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
strong
dry
coffee
notes
with
some
floral
undertones
and
lots
of
roasted
notes
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
interesting
but
closer
to
drinking
a
cup
of
coffee
than
a
beer
overall
really
solid
coffeeinfused
brew
delivers
more
than
just
a
cold
coffee
experience
my
heart
tells
me
a
deeper
roasted
flavor
would
be
nice
but
my
brain
tells
me
this
is
a
brown
so
i
shouldnt
expect
that
a
fine
brown
it
is
o
if
you
like
coffee
it
is
going
to
be
hard
to
find
fault
in
this
beer
breakfastdessert
im
not
sure
where
this
works
best
coffee
is
intense
but
there
is
noticeable
caramel
sweetness
in
there
too
and
i
get
a
thick
fudgy
chocolate
aspect
as
well
that
never
causes
this
to
approach
mocha
but
rather
causes
this
to
slip
into
a
coffee
infused
dark
chocolate
cake
like
dessert
character
i
like
this
one
a
lot
a
light
body
which
fits
the
abv
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
those
who
want
a
coffee
fix
overall
a
good
beer
one
i
would
consider
drinking
in
the
morning
on
one
of
my
rare
days
off
overall
my
girlfriend
usually
hates
all
the
beer
i
drink
and
actually
liked
this
so
that
alone
impresses
me
this
is
just
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
would
definitely
drink
again
cheers
overall

oh
hell
yes
i
love
this
beer
had
it
for
the
first
time
a
little
over
three
years
ago
loved
it
then
didnt
have
it
again
until
a
few
days
ago
and
still
love
it
this
is
at
its
heart
a
clean
simple
and
relatively
dry
american
brown
that
pulls
in
an
extremely
tasteful
coffee
component
integrates
it
flawlessly
and
becomes
that
much
better
for
it
seek
it
out
its
worth
it
plus
at
5
5
abv
you
can
have
a
couple
without
a
problem
d
its
tough
to
emulate
a
good
cafe
cubano
and
ccb
does
a
fine
job
with
it
definitely
one
to
seek
out
o
cigar
city
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
once
again
overall
a
great
brew
this
hit
exactly
what
they
wanted
it
to
be
great
brew
with
great
flavors
i
could
easly
drink
this
in
the
morning
before
work
haha
m
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
i
expected
especially
for
a
brown
ale
sitting
at
5
5
its
no
ris
of
course
but
its
still
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
feels
good
sipping
on
this
beer
and
i
sip
because
the
flavors
are
really
nice
m
lightish
bodied
a
bit
too
much
carb
o
i
dont
drink
coffee
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
depth
and
complexity
overall
definitely
let
this
one
warm
up
as
it
is
much
better
lots
of
espresso
and
chocolate
with
some
caramel
thrown
it
kind
of
a
mix
between
a
porter
and
a
brown
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
its
got
a
more
authentic
vanilla
flavour
mixed
in
with
a
nice
coffee
flavour
and
its
all
supported
at
the
base
by
the
base
brown
ale
yet
another
well
crafted
beer
from
cigar
city
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
cigar
city
knows
how
to
brew
up
some
tasty
brown
ales
its
kind
of
an
under
appreciated
style
but
if
you
have
the
chance
to
give
this
one
a
try
do
not
hesitate
it
is
unique
and
quite
tasty
o
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
sits
at
the
top
compared
to
the
rest
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
and
one
i
would
recommend
and
seek
out
perfect
with
a
cigar
just
drinking
away
only
knock
on
it
to
me
was
i
wish
it
was
higher
in
abv
and
made
more
of
a
sipper
the
higher
abv
would
of
lent
a
great
hand
into
the
mix
of
some
perfectly
tasting
and
balanced
ingredients
that
are
already
present
none
the
less
an
enjoyable
brew
i
left
this
beer
wanting
a
little
more
for
what
it
is
its
fantastic
a
nice
flavorful
brown
ale
the
nose
carries
this
insane
strong
coffe
smell
so
you
expect
something
deep
and
rich
but
its
not
either
the
carbonation
got
in
the
way
and
the
lack
of
depth
definitely
give
this
beer
a
try
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
again
though
i
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
for
breakfast
o
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
was
good
to
bad
you
have
to
jazz
it
up
for
me
to
dig
it
best
espresso
aroma
of
any
beer
ive
had
pours
a
deep
brown
with
very
little
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
so
good
deep
rich
coffee
aroma
with
sweet
malt
and
a
rich
earthiness
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
coffeetoffee
front
with
a
back
sweetness
from
the
malt
it
almost
has
the
superb
mouth
feel
of
maduro
where
i
think
there
might
be
some
rolled
oats
to
increase
the
creaminess
but
i
get
much
less
oat
than
i
do
in
maduro
really
enjoy
this
beer
when
it
comes
out
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
instead
of
just
crushing
the
4
pack
in
a
few
days
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
coconut
coffee
brown
sugar
a
hint
of
smoke
and
some
distant
hoppiness
taste
is
rich
and
dominated
by
a
fruity
coffee
taste
wood
pine
and
maple
take
over
after
the
coffee
makes
its
statement
finish
is
sweet
and
sticky
a
nice
beer
overall
the
beer
is
fantastic
however
the
coffee
seems
to
mask
the
flavor
of
brown
ale
its
almost
like
iced
black
coffee
i
love
coffee
but
still
want
to
taste
the
beer
a
great
beer
for
any
coffee
lover
nice
easy
drinking
would
get
again
it
is
a
nice
way
to
finish
the
night
after
some
heavy
hitters
i
had
this
beer
in
the
bottles
before
and
thought
it
was
better
than
this
the
draft
really
brought
out
the
weak
espresso
beans
really
nice
appearance
rich
espresso
aroma
but
weak
taste
ill
stick
to
the
bottles
taste
the
malt
and
coffee
blend
very
well
together
nothing
overpowering
this
is
not
a
coffee
forward
beer
but
its
nice
and
smooth
making
it
a
very
drinkable
brown
and
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
guy
its
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
most
browns
but
its
also
got
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
which
is
a
good
twist
overall
very
well
done
and
very
enjoyable
dated
may

sooo
not
fresh
at
all
being
almost
exactly
two
years
old
pours
a
dark
brown
body
that
lets
some
light
through
huge
mocha
foam
head
forms
instantly
over
flowing
the
glass
cools
down
into
one
fingers
worth
the
smell
is
surprisingly
still
coffee
heavy
cold
pressed
espresso
with
some
metallic
notes
the
taste
is
much
better
with
faded
espresso
beans
and
some
lightly
roasted
malts
a
bitter
coffee
bean
aftertaste
somewhat
creamy
mouth
feel
i
hate
reviewing
a
coffee
beer
with
two
years
on
it
but
its
not
as
terrible
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
coffee
is
still
hanging
on
o
definitely
a
coffee
lovers
beer
with
bold
flavors
and
a
nice
hazelnutvanilla
kick
as
bold
as
these
flavors
are
they
balance
out
nicely
really
enjoyed
this
one
oeverything
was
downhill
after
the
nose
still
good
but
was
expecting
more
the
beer
pours
a
light
roast
coffeebrown
slightly
like
synthetic
pancake
syrup
and
it
sits
in
the
glass
as
a
very
dark
syrupy
brown
it
pours
with
about
a
quarters
finger
width
of
very
slightly
tanning
head
that
fades
from
the
middle
of
the
beer
but
stays
consistent
on
the
sides
the
beer
leaves
a
slight
lacing
of
dry
splotchy
bubble
sheets
the
beers
body
is
dark
and
slightly
hazy
but
seems
clean
of
particles
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
phenomenally
of
thick
bitter
chocolaty
espresso
it
has
that
sortof
stale
coffee
bean
scent
that
is
really
quite
inviting
it
has
a
grainy
yet
slightly
milked
coffee
bean
smell
to
it
that
i
am
just
loving
the
superb
slight
creamy
chocolate
nuances
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
then
builds
into
a
lovely
coffee
bitter
the
flavor
begins
as
sweet
cacao
chocolate
flavors
that
slowly
roast
in
the
mouth
and
become
sweet
creamy
espresso
with
a
touch
of
bitter
instant
coffee
the
finish
is
beautiful
mocha
espresso
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
of
slight
bitter
coffee
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
with
a
creamy
lattefoam
feel
to
the
carbonation
the
mouth
is
left
feeling
slightly
dry
from
the
encroaching
roast
of
the
coffee
beans
and
some
slight
acidneutralizing
spittle
presumably
also
from
the
coffee
beans
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
this
is
a
superb
coffee
beer
and
a
superb
coffee
brown
ale
i
love
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
and
i
absolutely
love
the
balance
between
the
bitter
coffee
and
the
creamy
sweet
vanilla
and
chocolate
flavors
this
beer
thrives
on
superb
balance
and
is
fully
worth
sampling
this
is
probably
the
best
nonestout
coffee
beer
ive
ever
tried
try
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
and
a
kahki
half
finger
head
aroma
is
more
in
you
face
coffee
than
i
have
ever
experienced
like
snorting
ground
up
eapresso
beans
with
a
touch
of
sweet
flavor
is
all
coffee
earthy
bitter
up
front
with
a
hint
od
vanilla
on
the
finish
easy
drinking
with
prickly
carbonation
lighter
mouthfeel
than
i
had
expectedz
an
excellent
brown
ale
overall
a
flavourful
easy
drinker
which
isnt
swamped
with
sweetness
like
so
many
beers
with
these
types
of
flavours
going
on
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
on
a
side
note
yes
it
is
flavours
i
am
canadian
and
thats
how
we
roll
neighbour
thanks
again
tobey
overall
another
great
cigar
city
beer
they
make
some
damn
good
brown
ales
and
this
is
right
on
par
a
must
try
for
any
coffee
beer
fan
a
good
change
from
the
stronger
stouts
not
too
rich
or
sweet
by
any
means
its
kind
of
watery
but
still
contains
large
doses
of
flavor
a
finely
crafted
brew
from
ccb
and
one
id
crave
at
anytime
o
the
smell
is
incredible
as
a
coffee
lover
but
would
have
liked
to
see
that
carry
over
into
the
taste
the
sweetness
either
just
overpowers
any
espresso
there
might
be
in
it
somehow
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
nonimperial
coffee
beers
ive
had
poured
into
a
snifter
coffee
whew
lots
of
it
pours
dark
with
a
large
tanwhite
head
clings
to
glass
exceptionally
well
smells
of
nothing
other
than
coffee
in
the
nose
espresso
taste
in
the
beginning
then
moves
to
vanilla
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
before
returning
back
to
a
more
bitter
coffee
finish
props
again
to
ksurkin
irecieved
this
in
a
recent
stout
bif
served
in
a
ccb
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
coffee
brown
good
head
solid
lacing
the
best
smelling
coffee
beer
i
have
ever
sampled
pure
esspresso
beans
taste
like
it
smells
he
beer
is
light
and
easy
drinking
well
made
all
around
imo
more
of
a
stout
than
a
brown
ale
but
who
cares
damn
tasty
o
i
really
like
this
beer
it
smells
and
tastes
exactly
like
how
i
would
imagine
expresso
beer
would
taste
like
i
am
very
impressed
it
is
only
okay
in
the
other
aspects
but
the
smell
and
taste
more
then
make
up
for
that
get
this
beer
if
you
can
a
must
try
for
any
coffee
drinker
or
fan

the
retention
is
very
good
along
with
the
lacing

and
some
chocolate

nicely
carbonated

smooth

and
drinkable

suggest

out
another
great
beer
by
cigar
city
o
a
really
tasty
beer
and
not
a
bad
price
11
for
4
i
think
this
is
tasty
enough
to
just
savor
and
sip
at
but
i
could
knock
these
back
pretty
easily
too
a
nice
goto
coffee
beer
if
i
loved
down
by
cigar
city
i
would
buy
a
lot
of
this
o
amazing
a
great
beer
and
im
not
a
brown
ale
fan
great
infusion
of
coffee
vanilla
and
cocoa
another
hit
from
ccb
wow
this
was
one
amazing
beer
after
going
to
miami
and
actually
having
legit
cafe
cubanos
in
calle
ocho
i
had
an
idea
what
i
was
looking
for
i
honestly
dont
think
you
could
get
any
closer
of
a
representation
in
a
beer
it
was
spot
on
the
smell
has
that
sweet
roasted
bean
body
to
it
unreal
taste
was
similar
maybe
a
little
more
vanilla
still
amazes
me
how
close
to
the
real
thing
it
is
the
closer
it
got
to
room
temperature
the
better
it
got
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
some
red
highlights
small
tan
head
decent
lacing
aroma
is
a
soft
chocolate
and
a
light
malt
and
nice
coffee
flavor
is
a
mellow
coffee
with
a
nice
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
subtle
roast
fantastic
flavor
of
coffee
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
a
very
well
done
beer
o
mightbe
my
new
favorite
from
ccb
if
bottles
make
their
way
up
here
im
in
coffee
lovers
need
to
try
this
one
sweet
hazelnuts
and
espresso
greet
my
nose
up
front
candied
coffee
leads
to
a
slightlywatery
brown
ale
base
supported
by
espresso
beans
nose
and
taste
are
constructed
very
nicely
smooth
drinking
totally
sessionable
hard
to
believe
this
is
the
same
beer
because
i
really
like
it
id
happily
drink
this
regularly
provided
theres
no
infection
o
a
goodbut
not
great
coffe
beer
from
cigar
city
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
lighter
version
of
coffee
bender
overall
i
did
think
the
vanilla
added
a
nice
sweetness
to
the
beer
that
prevented
it
from
having
too
much
bitterness
from
the
espresso
poured
a
very
cloudy
cedar
brown
color
with
a
small
cap
of
tannish
head
that
retained
as
a
ringlet
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nutty
aroma
rife
with
coffee
grounds
taste
of
coffee
grounds
as
promised
by
the
nose
nutty
caramel
malts
toasted
grains
grassy
and
slightly
astringent
in
the
finish
body
was
about
medium
a
little
thintasting
but
generally
pretty
drinkable
not
something
id
go
out
of
the
way
for
again
cigar
city
has
yet
another
delicious
brown
ale
with
a
nice
floridian
twist
this
is
a
delicious
brew
this
is
unique
among
the
coffee
beers
ive
had
in
that
its
not
a
stout
and
the
coffee
is
cuban
coffee
its
a
really
good
combination
of
two
of
my
favorite
drinks
and
is
the
beer
that
originally
made
me
take
notice
of
cigar
city
a
couple
of
years
ago
o
way
way
way
better
than
my
previous
review
its
still
not
gonna
be
a
favorite
beer
of
mine
but
i
am
quite
pleased
to
have
tried
it
again
o
it
gave
me
the
impression
of
drinking
strong
cold
unsweetened
coffee
something
that
they
might
have
been
going
for
but
not
necessarily
what
i
was
looking
for
some
of
those
flavorsaromas
desirable
in
coffee
came
across
as
being
a
little
off
in
this
beer
i
think
id
prefer
this
with
a
more
pronounced
chocolate
malt
presence
im
trying
to
be
fair
but
this
one
just
didnt
really
bowl
me
over
my
fiancee
enjoyed
it
but
she
doesnt
have
an
account
on
here
so
o
i
am
in
love
this
beer
has
a
very
easy
drinking
quality
and
with
an
abv
that
is
quite
manageable
this
beer
is
something
i
could
have
all
day
the
flavors
exhibited
in
this
beer
are
masterful
espresso
dominates
but
never
overshadows
any
of
the
other
flavors
if
i
could
by
cases
of
this
beer
i
would
o
very
solid
and
rich
in
flavor
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
a
tad
lower
for
me
though
cost
7
99
for
a
four
pack
overall
this
was
a
very
unique
one
drank
more
like
a
porter
than
any
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
and
i
loved
the
sweetness
of
it
this
is
an
amazing
beer
for
a
style
i
could
take
or
leave
this
brew
nailed
down
the
most
important
objectivehaving
a
quality
coffee
and
vanilla
taste
so
many
coffeevanilla
beers
fall
prey
to
being
too
sweet
having
no
standout
malts
or
hops
having
artificial
flavors
cigar
city
made
an
exquisite
coffee
brown
here
very
much
recommended
4
5
o
really
nice
tasting
brown
ale
the
carbonation
in
the
bottle
was
completely
ridiculous
after
is
gushed
out
of
my
glass
i
put
the
bottle
down
and
it
started
gushing
out
of
that
a
little
hectic
id
like
to
try
another
bottle
again
without
it
blowing
up
in
my
face
and
computer
7
a
4
pack
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
a
nice
play
on
a
brown
ale
the
flavor
is
complex
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
at
any
given
time
the
taste
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
me
the
5
5
abv
should
have
been
at
least
10
for
a
more
balanced
taste
i
am
really
surprised
this
beer
has
such
a
good
rating
not
my
favorite
o
this
is
great
id
drink
this
a
lot
if
i
could
find
it
its
really
an
awesome
beer
that
brings
coffee
into
a
smooth
lighter
beer
thats
not
heavy
like
a
stout
overall
ive
never
been
into
coffee
beers
because
the
idea
never
really
appealed
to
me
after
having
this
beer
i
can
easily
say
that
ive
gotten
over
my
unwillingness
to
try
coffee
beers
its
rich
flavorful
and
the
coffee
flavor
isnt
overpowering
at
all
those
who
have
cigar
city
available
in
your
area
i
envy
you
the
taste
is
really
coffee
forward
but
after
youve
become
accustomed
to
the
coffee
you
really
feel
am
underlying
sweetness
and
smoothness
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
beer
this
is
one
interesting
beer
they
definitely
nail
that
espresso
flavor
i
just
finished
a
bottle
and
im
headed
to
the
fridge
for
another
i
have
only
had
a
few
coffee
brown
ales
so
its
not
hard
to
say
that
this
one
is
the
best
the
cacao
and
vanilla
additions
make
this
beer
great
get
one
o
the
notes
of
coffee
and
vanilla
compliment
the
standard
roasty
and
smooth
character
of
the
standard
maduro
brown
ale
very
nicely
this
is
a
well
executed
play
on
an
already
great
maduro
brown
ale
and
also
a
great
digression
from
the
standard
coffeestout
combination
im
sold
on
coffeeoatmeal
brown
ales
fantastic
smooth
everything
i
want
in
a
brown
ale
recommended
overall
i
do
actually
like
the
flavors
of
the
beer
but
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
makes
this
beer
undrinkable
hey
cigar
city
figure
it
out
overall
not
bad
considering
i
dont
care
for
very
many
brown
ales
and
coffee
beers
are
quickly
falling
out
of
favor
for
some
reason
that
said
i
was
grateful
to
receive
this
as
an
extra
and
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
if
you
dont
like
coffee
dont
try
this
beer
stick
with
regular
maduro
coffee
fans
seek
this
one
out
o
cigar
city
reinventing
beer
one
project
at
a
time
ok
beer
as
im
a
fan
of
espresso
but
objectively
its
pretty
onenote
i
do
like
the
creaminess
the
oatmeal
adds
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
but
i
doubt
ill
seek
it
out
actively
o
loved
this
gave
a
bottle
to
my
noncraft
roommate
on
a
work
trip
and
he
instantly
wrote
down
some
info
on
the
beer
and
asked
how
he
can
get
it
back
in
nashville
i
think
that
really
speaks
to
the
quality
and
drinkability
of
this
great
beer
o
a
great
brown
ale
with
wonderful
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
and
aromas
the
main
drawback
is
the
slightly
watery
body
even
so
good
beer
lesser
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
perhaps
but
its
parts
are
all
very
very
good
o
not
a
bad
beer
i
liked
it
i
didnt
love
it
the
coffee
was
great
it
was
just
too
light
in
body
to
really
make
me
fall
for
it
overall
i
feel
that
this
was
an
excellent
offering
from
cigar
city
i
feel
that
due
to
the
sweetness
and
coffee
notes
its
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
desserts
however
its
versatile
and
can
be
enjoyed
at
any
time
heck
id
drink
this
with
breakfast
being
a
really
big
fan
of
coffee
beers
it
was
nice
to
try
a
different
take
on
one
typically
coffee
is
associated
with
stouts
but
cigar
city
clearly
was
able
to
reach
an
equally
complex
beer
without
adding
all
of
the
alcohol
when
making
this
one
hands
down
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
coffee
beers
heavy
coffee
flavor
but
easy
drinking
pours
a
clear
deep
ruby
color
with
a
one
finger
head
aroma
is
straightup
cuban
coffee
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
the
bottles
says
that
vanilla
and
caoco
was
added
but
i
only
get
coffee
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
quite
watery
overall
very
interesting
and
unique
this
tastes
like
cuban
coffee
with
carbonation
not
quite
as
good
as
the
base
maduro
but
still
great
for
a
brown
ale
overall
this
is
the
closest
brew
to
coffee
ive
had
its
like
drinking
carbonated
coffee
very
delicious
this
is
a
coffee
lovers
must
have
cheers
looked
like
the
date
code
said
june
11
so
i
was
worried
this
wasnt
going
to
be
in
good
shape
glad
i
was
wrong
pour
was
a
mahoganyish
brown
with
a
lightly
tanned
head
that
really
held
well
and
left
very
attractive
splotches
of
lace
nose
reminded
me
of
whoppers
chocolate
malt
balls
and
south
beach
cuban
bakeries
chocolate
malt
and
dark
roasty
cuban
style
espresso
con
leche
with
tobacco
vanilla
and
oak
well
done
cigar
city
pastries
and
a
kiss
of
hop
in
there
its
all
there
in
the
taste
but
hits
me
reverse
of
what
i
expected
chocolate
malt
and
tobacco
come
quickly
at
first
but
are
knocked
out
by
a
huge
wallop
of
espresso
that
leaves
with
a
faint
hoppiness
that
blends
the
two
styles
of
bitter
and
some
ashiness
very
light
medium
body
for
all
the
flavor
going
on
not
sticky
but
slick
indeed
and
very
minimal
aftertaste
cigar
city
brewing
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
maduro
treatments
impressive
to
begin
with
the
espresso
definitely
does
it
justice
and
evokes
a
sense
of
place
cant
wait
for
my
next
trip
to
fl
o
not
a
bad
brown
ale
but
like
i
said
one
has
to
be
a
coffee
lover
o
a
very
well
done
brown
ale
with
a
nice
espresso
kick
if
this
is
a
sign
of
what
cigar
city
does
i
am
looking
forward
to
some
more
overall
a
good
beer
and
with
a
light
body
and
mouthfeel
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
extremely
drinkable
and
very
good
if
you
like
coffee
go
for
this
you
wont
be
disappointed
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
definitely
my
first
letdown
from
ccb
i
checked
other
reviews
for
this
beer
and
only
found
one
other
case
where
the
ba
also
had
an
infected
bottle
either
i
had
extremely
bad
luck
or
other
recipients
of
this
batch
decided
not
to
review
im
putting
this
out
here
for
informational
purposes
both
for
the
brewer
and
my
fellow
bas
i
hope
this
is
a
rare
occurrence
for
what
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
coffee
is
too
strong
and
thus
no
balance
o
a
solid
brown
ale
with
a
very
nice
coffee
presence
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
make
this
easy
drinking
cheers
cigar
city
o
its
a
nice
light
brown
ale
definitely
easy
drinking
overall
another
infected
cigar
city
porter
booo
overall
not
as
good
as
the
other
maduro
treatments
its
just
a
lot
of
coffee
and
it
doesnt
blend
so
well
with
the
other
flavors
could
be
better
but
its
drinkable
o
a
fine
beer
nothing
special
its
nothing
special
in
the
end
a
decent
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
well
enough
to
be
a
great
beer
cheers
o
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
beer
if
you
enjoy
brown
ales
personally
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
which
maybe
hindering
my
review
a
bit
o
good
coffee
flavor
that
isnt
too
overpowering
great
mouthfeel
well
i
liked
this
one
so
much
i
might
have
to
take
shots
of
espresso
daily
very
well
done
o
good
beer
if
you
are
into
coffee
beers
you
need
to
seek
this
one
out
has
a
strong
espresso
taste
and
smell
very
enjoyable
beer
o
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
you
enjoy
drinking
coffee
and
espressos
and
youre
a
beer
fan
this
brew
is
made
for
you
overall
an
excellent
beer
the
espresso
is
just
the
right
strength
and
the
grouping
of
the
flavors
is
excellent
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
in
a
while
and
it
may
well
be
the
best
american
brown
ive
ever
had
the
bottle
has
been
cooling
down
for
most
of
the
day
and
i
cannot
resist
any
longer
my
pour
created
a
dense
finger
of
deeptan
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
limited
light
penetration
and
only
amber
highlights
at
the
edges
nose
took
me
back
to
la
maddalena
sicily
c
1985
and
sunday
late
morningsafternoons
learning
how
to
play
bocce
from
the
natives
you
can
call
it
cubanstyle
all
you
want
but
espresso
is
espresso
the
world
over
and
i
readily
recognize
the
scent
giuseppe
guillermo
was
the
name
of
the
old
man
who
took
me
under
his
wing
put
a
cuppa
in
my
left
nonthrowing
hand
a
pallino
in
my
right
hand
and
a
parodi
in
my
mouth
mouthfeel
was
big
full
and
tasted
like
cold
coffee
you
had
best
brace
yourself
for
the
flavor
of
tobacco
charcoal
and
simple
roastiness
if
you
plan
to
indulge
in
this
gem
i
no
longer
smoke
anything
due
to
adultonset
asthma
but
this
made
me
want
to
light
up
for
you
cigar
aficionados
i
recommend
a
maduro
if
you
catch
my
drift
the
finish
left
me
feeling
like
i
had
just
finished
a
bocce
match
my
mouth
was
dry
and
laden
with
a
taste
of
charcoal
smoke
and
my
heart
was
racing
good
times
brothers
good
times
say
did
i
just
remember
there
is
another
bottle
awaiting
my
attention
serve
this
to
friends
and
youll
definitely
have
a
talking
point
its
very
distinctive
this
beer
was
courtesy
of
phisigben
from
a
recent
in
person
trade
thanks
ben
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
rich
mahogany
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
one
finger
beige
colored
head
it
looks
a
little
lighter
than
i
remember
maduro
it
smells
like
big
sound
of
all
things
mixed
with
a
shot
of
espresso
it
gives
aromas
of
chocolate
sweet
malt
cream
with
a
light
coffee
bitterness
the
flavors
presented
are
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
bitter
coffee
the
chocolate
doesnt
come
in
as
well
as
it
did
in
the
nose
and
the
overly
appealing
scotch
esque
malt
isnt
present
either
the
flavor
is
also
short
lived
and
not
as
strong
as
it
could
or
should
be
it
drinks
a
little
thin
and
thinner
than
maduro
and
just
doesnt
feature
the
same
complexity
as
the
base
beer
overall
its
a
solid
beer
but
maduro
is
far
superior
in
my
opinion
o
nice
beer
thanks
matt
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
the
beer
is
brown
and
somewhat
hazy
with
a
thin
beige
collar
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
behind
the
aroma
consists
of
coffee
beans
tobacco
smoke
roast
leather
and
some
mustiness
jeff
nailed
it
this
beer
smells
like
john
wayne
the
flavor
is
more
coffee
forward
than
the
nose
would
indicate
with
less
intricacies
than
were
presented
to
the
olfactory
senses
the
base
beer
is
still
distinguishable
and
not
overrun
by
the
often
dominating
coffee
scents
the
feel
is
somewhat
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
a
decent
brew
and
quite
interesting
not
my
favorite
coffee
brew
but
intriguing
and
worth
a
try
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
i
liked
the
original
version
better
for
sure
cheers
eh
cigar
city
is
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
and
a
brewery
i
always
welcome
and
look
forward
to
trying
more

this
is
not
one
of
their
better
offerings

leaving
the
slightest
hint
of

the

hits
you
with
straightforward
creamy
espresso
chicory
along
with
the
slightest
note
of
sour
funk
and

the
taste

mouthfeel

a
nice
bitter

edge
keeps
the
sweetness
in
balance
again
there
is
a
touch
of
sourness
in
this
beer
a
very
straightforward
pleasant
tasting
and
easy
drinking
beer
o
nothing
id
have
again
unless
this
bottle
has
just
turned
somehow
thanks
again
blueokie
overall
very
good
drink
here
however
provides
more
of
a
chocolate
bent
than
coffee
surprisingly
but
hey
nobody
is
complaining
o
this
is
my
second
favorite
maduro
variation
so
far
right
behind
oak
and
beans
this
is
a
candycoffeetoffee
lovers
delight
overall
cigar
city
met
their
goals
here
its
a
very
nice
coffee
flavored
brown
ale
and
i
am
impressed
with
the
flavor
they
packed
in
to
a
5
5
abv
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
sessionable
version
of
their
maduro
brown
but
i
was
expecting
more
to
be
honest
i
really
love
the
original
and
the
oatmeal
cookie
version
but
the
espresso
addition
really
doesnt
add
much
here
also
the
body
seems
thin
to
me
an
enjoyable
brown
ale
nonetheless
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
love
coffee
and
spice
in
my
beers
this
was
the
perfect
mix
of
both
without
being
too
heavy
or
boozy
this
beer
is
delicious
and
its
one
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
and
again
fuller
medium
body
medium
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
and
soft
on
the
tongue
i
enjoyed
the
addition
of
espresso
to
the
already
tasty
base
beer
keep
these
variations
coming

this

could
have

i
didnt
enjoy
this

much
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
one
id
be
happy
to
drink
again
in
the
future
probably
the
strongest
coffee
flavored
brew
i
have
encountered
thus
far
quite
an
enjoyable
experience
and
would
definitely
try
again
overall
definitely
worth
a
try
for
a
beer
with
coffee
beans
added
its
a
little
too
aggressive
on
the
coffee
flavor
maybe
with
a
little
age
on
it
maybe
68
months
it
would
really
shine
as
it
is
its
worth
finding
and
drinking
light
bodied
with
a
bit
too
much
aggressive
and
prickly
carbonation
for
my
liking
for
a
5
5
abv
beer
there
is
a
good
amount
of
flavor
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
this
more
often
poured
a
thin
1
finger
head
that
dissipates
into
a
paper
thin
lining
over
the
beer
aroma
of
strong
roasted
coffee
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
taste
follows
the
nose
and
then
some
freakin
delicious
coffee
balances
with
malts
well
mouthfeel
is
right
where
i
want
it
carbonation
may
be
a
little
high
but
nothing
crazy
overall
its
an
amazing
coffee
brown
ale
ive
said
it
before
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
brown
ales
but
when
you
mask
it
with
tons
of
espresso
it
makes
them
a
whole
ton
better
poured
ontap
at
the
cigar
city
brewing
tasting
room
in
tampa
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
has
the
same
body
and
color
of
maduro
brown
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
light
thin
foamy
head
smells
like
i
dove
into
a
double
espresso
smelling
this
made
the
hair
on
my
chest
stand
up
bravo
flavor
is
very
heavy
in
the
coffee
and
tastes
like
i
am
eating
coffee
beans
slight
sweetness
helps
balance
the
bitterness
from
the
liquid
juan
valdez
the
aftertaste
is
like
wearing
a
used
folgers
filter
around
your
neck
with
some
light
sweet
malty
and
spiced
flavors
dry
crisp
finish
very
tasty
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
are
big
bold
and
tasty
its
really
hard
not
to
be
impressed
by
this
my
first
cigar
city
beer
and
it
wasnt
too
bad
o
so
so
beer
for
me
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
and
note
the
best
sue
of
coffee
ok
beer
overall
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
balance
to
it
i
taste
the
coffee
but
i
can
also
taste
the
elements
that
make
it
a
brown
ale
id
have
another
o
all
in
all
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
or
coffee
beers
i
have
tried
there
are
many
better
try
if
you
like
cigar
city
stuff
or
light
thin
brown
ales

the
mouthfeel
here
is
great
its
got
just
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
the
drinkability
is
amazing
this
one
never
lasts
very
long
in
front
of
me
overall
i
really
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
great
beer
i
love
my
coffee
and
i
love
my
beer
and
this
is
a
perfect
intersection
between
the
two
oi
like
this
a
lot
of
intense
brown
ales
seem
to
borderline
a
porter
or
a
stout
but
this
is
definitely
a
brown
ale
the
body
of
it
is
so
light
it
makes
this
possible
to
quaff
easily
for
a
lower
abv
brown
ale
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
i
think
anyone
would
enjoy
this
o
the
flavor
doesnt
line
up
with
the
aroma
on
the
other
hand
id
probably
get
it
again
to
try
on
tap
i
am
just
loving
all
of
the
ccb
beers
i
have
tried
i
am
a
big
fan
of
coffee
brewed
beers
and
enjoy
a
rich
taste
cubano
espresso
poured
a
shade
lighter
than
a
midnight
black
fresh
brewed
cup
of
espresso
i
kept
expecting
to
see
steam
wafting
up
instead
of
the
small
head
the
smell
was
nice
and
inviting
with
a
roasty
bakers
chocolate
and
espresso
aroma
the
taste
was
big
bold
and
refreshing
with
huge
fresh
brewed
espresso
and
minty
hops
dancing
in
the
background
to
give
it
a
good
balance
its
a
real
eye
opener
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
onefinger
light
coffee
colored
head
big
time
espresso
aroma
bold
coffee
beans
and
a
bit
of
maduro
cigar
wrapper
cuban
style
coffee
definitely
shines
in
the
flavor
big
bitter
and
bold
unsweetened
powdery
chocolate
taste
some
nuttiness
and
what
is
a
solid
kick
of
maduro
cigar
wrapper
in
the
finish
o
another
in
the
long
line
of
cc
brews
that
i
really
enjoy
this
is
a
winner
and
a
great
drinker
makes
me
feel
like
im
in
little
havana
eating
some
guava
pastries
and
sipping
espresso
overall
boom
for
cigar
city
i
have
yet
to
be
dissapointed
with
their
fine
craftsmanship
this
beer
is
certainly
no
exception
awesome
coffee
infusion
usually
experienced
for
me
in
a
stout
now
tasted
in
a
bomb
ass
brown
ale
overall
had
to
keep
reminding
myself
that
this
is
based
off
their
brown
ale
and
is
not
meant
to
have
the
full
body
and
added
complexity
of
a
porter
although
the
cuban
style
espresso
smell
and
taste
are
just
crying
for
more
those
with
adverse
effects
to
caffeine
need
not
apply
color
is
reddish
brown
and
pours
very
clear
despite
the
yeast
sediment
head
is
minimal
but
leaves
a
pretty
pattern
of
lacing
smell
is
pure
espresso
has
a
creamy
feel
with
a
medium
weight
that
just
glides
effortlessly
across
the
palate
taste
is
again
pure
espresso
there
is
some
hops
and
malts
in
the
finish
a
fantastic
brew
thatll
leave
you
running
laps
around
the
househello
espresso
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorite
brews
perfect
for
those
lazy
sunday
mornings
delicious
excellent
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
coffee
beers
ive
ever
tasted
masterfully
balanced
the
chocolate
really
sets
this
one
apart
well
done
o
a
nice
beer
from
a
company
i
truly
respect
greatly
up
to
this
point
cigar
city
has
beers
that
are
phenomenal
and
then
a
few
that
miss
for
me
and
then
a
lot
of
solid
beers
this
being
in
the
solid
category
nice
overall
a
really
nice
coffe
beer
some
can
be
over
the
top
due
to
lack
of
balance
but
really
well
done
with
coffeemalthop
balance
o
there
is
a
strange
funk
in
this
beer
but
i
end
up
liking
it
in
the
end
the
coffee
and
chocolate
are
good
but
possibly
a
bit
too
much
in
the
end
pretty
decent
brew
when
all
is
considered
pours
a
dark
coffee
brown
with
a
small
brown
head
that
vanishes
pretty
quick
decent
lacing
coats
the
sides
of
the
glass
but
doesnt
stick
smell
is
of
strong
coffee
beans
and
that
is
about
it
taste
is
rather
good
if
you
like
coffee
style
beers
strong
notes
of
coffee
but
not
to
overpowering
mouthful
is
too
thin
and
almost
no
carbonation
is
present
overall
this
beer
is
decent
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
but
this
isnt
something
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
o
great
brew
would
love
to
have
again
i
did
not
care
for
the
body
of
the
brew
as
i
felt
it
was
to
thin
for
the
type
and
amount
of
flavor
that
was
powering
through
would
have
to
pass
on
this
one
in
the
near
future
o
over
all
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
definitely
a
must
try
but
compared
to
some
i
have
tried
very
unique
overall
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
amazing
but
pretty
good
o
like
an
espresso
this
is
a
slow
drinker
that
will
take
a
while
to
get
through
i
think
i
would
really
like
this
beer
if
it
were
better
balanced
and
not
so
dominated
by
the
espresso
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
beer
they
really
got
some
great
espresso
flavors
in
there
and
managed
to
get
them
very
clean
and
drinkable
the
malt
helped
balance
a
little
but
didnt
add
a
ton
of
flavor
overall
loved
the
flavor
to
it
overall
and
one
of
the
best
coffee
infused
beers
ive
had
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
of
the
beer
flavor
coming
through
though
pours
a
deep
amberbrown
with
a
thick
tan
head
great
lacing
as
i
swirl
it
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
straight
espresso
roasted
coffee
beans
slight
caramel
sweetness
flavor
follows
the
nose
roastycaramel
malt
backbone
with
a
strong
coffeetobacco
presence
throughout
and
in
the
finish
very
strong
coffee
profile
slight
astringency
in
the
finish
almost
slightly
acidic
medium
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
very
well
put
together
brown
ale
overall
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
sure
if
i
would
try
and
get
my
hands
on
it
again
d
a
very
nice
brown
ale
and
yet
another
successful
twist
on
a
classic
from
ccb
d
really
liked
this
one
as
much
as
the
regular
version
would
def
have
more
often
if
i
was
closer
to
ccb
but
im
not
oh
sad
oh
well
very
enjoyable
this
was
the
shock
of
our
taster
and
well
worth
trying
a
big
improvement
on
maduro
d
bartender
ill
have
another
and
another
and
another
bravo
cigar
city
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
maduro
oatmeal
brown
ale
series
i
hope
its
as
good
in
the
bottle
bc
im
on
a
quest
to
find
some
more
such
a
unique
take
on
coffee
beer
d
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
in
fact
i
drank
half
the
growler
id
drink
it
again
too
if
it
wasnt
so
difficult
to
get
in
new
york
id
recommend
this
for
after
dinner
i
ordered
it
before
then
ended
up
getting
other
beers
while
i
sipped
on
this
and
drank
a
majority
of
it
for
dessert
its
a
great
replacement
for
the
postdinner
espresso
if
your
in
tampa
area
go
to
ccb
and
have
some
beers
this
was
an
enjoyable
beverage
makes
me
want
to
head
to
a
cigar
shop
for
a
montecristo
strong
coffee
a
taste
of
cuba
d
a
great
brew
without
a
doubt
but
a
little
attention
is
needed
in
regards
to
the
head
and
nose
nonetheless
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
coffee
brews
ive
had
to
date
keep
up
the
good
work
ccb
pours
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
tints
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
eith
great
lacing
smells
very
chocolatey
and
espresso
heavy
the
chocolate
malt
is
probably
the
single
most
prominent
feature
tastes
very
chocolatey
and
some
hints
of
bitter
roasted
flavours
there
is
definitely
some
coffee
background
but
mostly
chocolate
overwhelms
thick
solid
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
a
nice
enough
beer
definitely
for
the
coffeeholic
have
to
say
i
prefer
the
regular
maduro
d
a
musttry
for
coffee
brew
fiends
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
a
lot
the
aroma
really
tugs
you
in
and
the
flavor
and
feel
hold
serve
with
authority
d
with
a
low
abv
and
a
great
flavor
i
can
easily
drink
a
lot
of
these
had
it
with
brunch
once
and
it
was
amazing
this
beer
is
pretty
good
on
its
merits
it
is
medium
bodied
no
real
carbonation
in
the
mouth
finish
is
mildly
bitter
not
dry
nice
midpalate
flavors
of
tobacco
and
some
late
coffee
roast
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
fine
beer
i
would
have
more
of
this
in
the
future
drinkability
i
think
that
is
has
great
drinkability
i
would
session
this
beer
even
though
it
is
just
over
the
abv
level
it
was
all
around
very
enjoyable
pour
is
a
dark
crimson
light
brown
with
a
lacey
dirtytan
head
major
coffee
aroma
roasted
coffee
beans
light
cocoa
and
caramel
notes
this
is
a
big
coffeeheavy
brew
not
strong
but
the
coffee
really
dominates
taste
is
light
and
filled
with
roast
espresso
the
coffee
flavor
really
pops
in
a
weaker
abv
beer
like
this
instead
of
getting
snowed
under
by
the
alcohol
real
coffee
lovers
beer
here
overall
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
the
best
flavor
ive
ever
gotten
from
a
coffee
infused
beer
i
really
like
that
cigar
city
went
a
different
direction
and
blended
the
coffee
with
a
brown
ale
instead
of
a
stout
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
especially
coffee
lovers
spot
on
for
the
style
with
a
nice
coffee
twist
a
local
brew
for
me
i
hope
they
keep
releasing
this
in
bottles
i
would
have
this
again
but
made
sure
i
didnt
drive
anywhere
i
instantly
passed
out
after
having
this
two
kids
screaming
in
the
background
too
really
nice
variation
of
the
brown
ale
style
with
tons
of
subtle
flavors
there
d
my
favorite
cc
brew
so
glad
they
decided
to
bottle
it
a
bit
filling
but
there
is
no
need
to
slam
a
bunch
of
these
beers
better
to
savor
every
drop

this
is
pretty
easy
to
have
a
few
rounds
slightly
warming
fairly
fullbodied
very
light
effervescence
very
good
a
decent
coffee
note
without
being
overwhelming
and
i
dont
like
coffee
at
all
had
this
one
on
tap
in
the
tasting
room
in
tampa
this
is
a
modified
version
of
cigar
citys
maduro
brown
ale
to
which
theyve
added
you
guessed
it
coffee
the
appearance
is
a
medium
brown
with
some
red
hues
coming
through
bubbly
white
head
great
aroma
the
coffee
really
comes
through
i
forgot
to
ask
exactly
what
the
method
for
adding
the
coffee
was
when
i
was
on
the
tour
grinds
vs
brewed
etc
but
the
aroma
is
very
full
and
roasty
the
taste
finds
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
from
the
roasted
maltscoffee
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
i
had
expected
but
this
actually
makes
it
much
more
drinkable
i
only
wish
we
could
buy
cigar
city
in
buffalo
as
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
would
make
a
winter
day
much
more
bearable
d
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
any
coffee
lovers
the
light
abv
makes
this
one
pretty
drinkable
as
well
smhas
the
thickness
of
the
maduro
oatmeal
brown
but
with
the
added
kick
of
the
espresso
this
was
a
surprisingly
great
beer
i
dont
know
why
but
i
went
into
this
not
expecting
coffee
to
go
with
a
brown
ale
but
the
base
is
the
oatmeal
brown
ale
and
the
thickness
of
the
oatmeal
gives
the
brown
ale
what
it
is
missing
for
me
overall
and
this
one
has
a
touch
of
a
stout
thing
with
the
espresso
well
worth
the
try
if
you
can
come
by
this
one
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
but
like
the
nonespresso
brew
a
bit
on
the
heavy

small
white

aroma
of
light
coffee
roasted
nuts
roasted
malt
flavor
of
intense
coffee
with
some
malt
in
the
background
but
mostly
its
just
all
about
the
coffee
as
i
continue
to
drink
some
peanut

and
oreo
cookie
notes
start
to
come
out
reminds
me
of
a
peanut

pie
all
i
can
say
is
yum
taste
is
fantastic
a
very
good
split
between
a
brown
ale
and
espresso
flavor
the
brown
ale
malt
complements
the
coffee
flavor
and
vice
versa
a
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
the
drinkability
is
great
for
a
coffee

the
mouthfeel
is
a

this
is
a
fantastic

all
the

not
the

d

am
completely
enjoying
this
brew
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown

that
borders
on
being
a
light
small
oatmeal
stout
served
from
tap
into
a
dogfish
head
stout
glass
enjoyed
with
jackthebear
on
a
recent
trip
to
athens
ga
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
big
espresso
coffee
and
cream
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
espresso
coffee
beans
cream
and
chocolate
it
had
a
mediumheavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
quite
excellent
since
i
personally
dont
drink
coffee
i
could
see
this
as
being
a
damn
fine
substitute
had
an
excellent
aroma
and
flavor
on
this
one
very
well
balanced
even
for
a
noncoffee
drinker
the
aroma
was
almost
intoxicating
it
was
so
rich
also
it
went
down
nice
and
smooth
leaving
you
craving
more
very
nice
brew
ccb
thanks
to
rtratzlaff
for
bringing
this
one
my
way
32oz
growler
into
a
hopus
tulip
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
frothy
off
white
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
loads
of
fresh
ground
espresso
in
front
of
brown
malts
and
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
a
more
subtle
balance
of
fresh
coffee
and
dark
malts
with
a
nice
lingering
bitter
coffee
finish
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
with
smooth
carbonation
and
an
interesting
kick
from
the
coffee
this
is
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
i
want
more
certainly
an
amazing
beer
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
3
maduros
ive
tried
so
far
while
the
expresso
flavor
is
great
it
really
drowns
out
all
the
other
flavors
of
this
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
thin
with
no
carb
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
from
a
growler
smells
like
freshly
ground
coffee
beans
like
i
had
a
cold
cup
of
the
strongest
espresso
ive
ever
had
tastes
like
coffee
really
fresh
coldpressed
coffee
right
on
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
but
its
suppose
to
be
like
coffee
right
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
coffee
beer
very
true
to
the
style
reviewed
from
my
notes
sampled
from
a
fresh
growler
i
split
with
blessedbebeer
this
beer
is
mostly
opaque
brown
but
it
appears
translucent
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
im
drinking
this
out
a
maine
beer
co
flute
it
has
a
tan
soapy
head
as
i
consume
the
beer
it
leaves
behind
some
good
lacework
and
film
it
has
a
huge
coffee
aroma
almost
as
if
someone
dumped
some
coffee
into
the
growler
before
sealing
it
all
kinds
of
roasted
malts
will
greet
your
nose
when
you
take
the
aroma
in
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
sweetness
up
front
it
reminds
me
of
granular
sugar
maybe
because
that
is
what
i
would
put
in
coffee
to
sweeten
it
up
the
coffee
flavors
come
in
at
the
finish
and
last
a
long
time
there
is
a
lot
of
coffee
bitterness
in
effect
its
like
drinking
an
alcoholic
cup
of
coffee
it
has
a
lighter
body
and
low
carbonation
there
is
almost
no
coating
left
behind
in
terms
of
texture
but
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
that
remains
in
my
mouth
after
i
swallow
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
there
is
a
lot
of
coffee
flavor
probably
more
than
in
any
other
beer
ive
tried
the
32oz
growler
that
cigar
city
offers
is
perfect
for
this
beer
any
more
of
it
and
youll
want
some
friends
to
share
with
d
if
i
wanted
beer
and
coffee
this
is
it
theres
nothing
offensive
and
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
brown
ale
highly
recommend
d
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
a
couple
of
us
finished
off
the
growler
pretty
quickly
the
low
abv
helps
here
even
though
the
beer
is
pretty
flavorful
biggest
point
of
comparison
is
coffee
bender
but
i
think
i
might
like
the
surly
offering
a
touch
more
poured
of
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jacksonville
a
small
tan
head
quickly
disipates
to
a
rim
around
the
glass
dark
almost
black
in
color
smell
is
all
coffee
taste
is
expresso
and
hop
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
at
5
5
percent
very
pleased
and
will
be
back
for
more
another
great
cigar
city
brew
had
this
is
pint
glass
big
espresso
nose
before
you
even
see
the
glass
this
one
is
completely
opaque
but
not
black
it
is
more
of
a
dark
brown
with
little
head
the
alochol
is
hidden
in
the
coffee
aroma
and
taste
a
night
capper
of
a
brew
because
of
the
overpowering
astingence
of
the
coffee
not
their
best
offering
served
in
a
snifter
it
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
redness
about
that
looks
to
be
a
very
deep
ruby
color
when
held
to
the
light
a
finger
of
creamy
head
covers
the
top
of
the
brew
and
coats
the
glassware
aroma
of
this
brew
has
a
roasty
nose
of
fresh
espresso
blended
with
some
smokey
notes
dare
i
say
it
actually
is
reminescent
of
a
cigar
taste
includes
coffee
blended
with
the
cigartobacco
flavors
previously
indicted
by
the
nose
this
tobacco
flavor
lingers
in
the
mouth
this
brew
has
a
light
feel
with
a
mild
level
of
carbonation
at
times
it
feels
a
bit
watery
but
it
makes
up
for
it
with
lots
of
flavor
d
at
5
50
this
might
not
qualify
as
a
session
beer
but
it
sure
is
drinkable
this
growler
will
be
empty
in
no
time
flat
i
could
drink
this
with
a
nice
breakfast
or
anytime
really
its
great
that
this
is
gonna
be
on
full
time
at
cigar
city
now
if
they
would
only
bottle
it
as
well
this
is
absoutely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
drinkability
is
quite
high
if
you
like
espresso
d
easy
going
down
makes
a
good
after
dinner
drink
a
delicious
brown
ale
i
was
just
hoping
for
a
bit
more
complexity
pours
a
muddy
brown
color
with
some
tan
head
and
lacing
scent
is
of
a
fresh
cup
of
espresso
dark
roasted
coffee
not
quite
burnt
with
touches
of
sweet
cream
taste
follows
scent
no
real
grainy
or
hop
notes
to
speak
of
not
quite
as
powerful
as
it
could
be
medium
bodied
which
makes
this
one
a
little
more
drinkable
than
your
typical
thick
espresso
stout
drinkability
good
despite
the
burnt
roast
flavor
that
i
dont
enjoy
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
tobacco
chocolate
coffee
and
sin
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
i
can
taste
large
amounts
of
tobacco
and
coffee
mixed
to
a
bit
of
sweet
hop
bitterness
slight
carbonation
really
adds
to
the
great
texture
and
flavor
overall
this
is
a
very
impressive
offering
and
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
cigar
city
is
simply
putting
out
amazing
brews
d
very
tasty
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
another
masterfullycrafted
brew
from
ccb
d
quite
good
if
you
are
in
it
for
the
nose
flavor
is
subdued
enough
to
make
it
an
easy
drinker
fairly
low
unnoticeable
abv
but
an
aroma
that
makes
you
want
to
have
enough
drink
interesting
to
say
the
least
but
a
little
thin
in
the
flavor
department
drinkability
most
other
brewers
blend
coffee
with
stout
or
porter
but
cigar
city
has
gone
in
a
different
direction
using
a
brown
ale
base
extraordinarily
different
the
beer
smells
better
then
it
tastes
but
ultimately
im
kind
of
impressed
with
what
cigar
city
seems
to
be
trying
to
accomplish
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
american
brown
ales
but
these
guys
are
starting
to
make
me
stop
and
take
notice
of
the
style
impressive
d
this
one
is
quite
simple
to
sum
up
its
a
better
than
average
american
brown
ale
with
a
tinge
of
coffee
i
wouldnt
turn
down
the
opportunity
to
drink
again
but
im
not
sure
youre
missing
much
if
you
arent
able
to
procure
a
glass
for
your
self
growler
shared
courtesy
of
andrew
pours
a
rusty
copper
color
with
a
browntan
head
not
too
big
but
nice
retention
on
it
smells
of
espresso
vanilla
chocolate
malt
roasted
malt
and
cream
tastes
of
cocoa
coffee
beans
vanilla
toasted
marshmallows
and
toasty
malts
medium
to
lighter
in
body
but
the
carbonation
matches
it
low
and
mellow
enhancing
the
complex
but
mild
flavors
as
such
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
and
i
would
have
been
inclined
to
drink
a
pint
of
this
if
it
were
readily
available
i
have
had
more
than
a
few
varieties
of
maduro
brown
but
this
one
is
superior
to
the
rest
overall
pretty
drinkable
being
so
thin
it
does
go
down
easy
but
i
would
rather
drink
less
and
have
the
beer
be
a
bit
thicker
in
mouthfeel
a
great
job
by
the
folks
at
cc
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
and
dry
d
quite
a
tasty
brown
ale
overall
and
certainly
not
too
heavyhanded
with
the
coffee
character
the
addition
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
hop
bitterness
kept
this
brew
from
becoming
too
onedimensional
enjoyable
but
not
mindblowing
ok
this
is
another
one
of
those
i
think
i
might
accidentally
attempt
to
order
this
beer
at
starbucks
instead
of
at
a
bar
straight
coffee
on
this
one
although
it
is
very
refreshing
and
light
bodied
unlike
the
wake
n
bake
from
terrapin
this
beer
is
smooth
light
and
not
very
filling
there
is
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
lingering
around
the
taste
of
the
beer
this
bee
is
pretty
dangerous
d
smooth
with
lots
of
complex
coffee
and
caramel
character
the
coffee
is
assertive
but
well
balanced
by
the
malt
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
this
is
a
very
nicely
made
beer
the
coffee
highlights
the
best
qualities
of
the
base
beer
without
overwhelming
it
overall
this
is
another
tasty
iteration
of
the
maduro
series
well
worth
a
shot
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
others
overall
a
very
sessionable
brown
i
could
easily
throw
back
a
few
pints
of
this
stuff
certainly
not
retired
this
was
a
uniquely
delicious
beer
i
almost
always
associate
intense
coffee
flavors
and
aromas
with
dark
roasty
smoky
stouts
this
brew
was
quite
different
however
i
would
love
to
see
other
brewers
try
their
hand
at
making
a
seemingly
small
beer
packed
with
such
intensity
this
is
stellar
stuff
d
unless
you
hate
coffee
or
are
caffeine
sensitive
this
is
way
drinkable
d
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
from
ccb
that
ive
had
great
coffee
flavors
to
go
along
with
the
sweetness
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
this
is
some
great
stuff
a
little
light
in
body
and
mouthfeel
lacking
depth
of
complexity
however
extremely
quaffable
sweet
dark
malts
with
espresso
on
the
finish
some
light
nutty
character
good
roastiness
on
the
finish
as
well
that
must
be
from
the
coffee
nice
beer
but
was
expecting
more
from
the
what
the
aroma
suggested
definitely
a
coffeeforward
aroma
but
its
not
a
really
oily
french
roast
or
anything
its
more
of
a
hazelnut
blend
type
of
thing
going
on
a
little
brown
sugar
and
some
grainy
malt
in
the
background
taste
mirrors
this
and
the
brown
ale
base
is
a
bit
more
evident
with
some
lightly
toasted
nuts
and
toffee
good
amount
of
malt
sweetness
really
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
which
is
definitely
thick
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
but
works
well
for
this
beer
really
drinkable
and
i
wish
that
i
had
gotten
more
than
a
16oz
growler
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
ccbs
brown
ales
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
this
one
on
tap
if
i
come
across
it
again

congratulations
on
a
job
well
done
pours
a
clear
almost
ruby
brown
color
with
a
tight
clingy
head
that
left
a
sheet
of
lacing
as
it
dissipated
the
aroma
is
of
a
big
bready
malt
nice
earthy
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
and
cocoa
powder
the
taste
is
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
powder
very
light
coffee
flavor
grassy
hops
and
a
lemon
sourness
towards
the
end
the
brew
has
a
very
earth
quality
to
it
which
is
nice
in
brown
ales
the
feel
is
surprisingly
thin
with
fairly
soft
carbonation
finishes
slightly
bitter
another
very
tastey
brew
from
cigar
city
solid
brown
ale
base
with
oatmeal
to
make
the
ale
very
smooth
nice
powedery
chocolate
flavor
gives
this
an
appealing
earthy
quality
i
appreciate
the
5
5abv
d
this
beer
is
wonderful
this
is
what
a
brown
ale
should
be
it
smells
amazing
it
tastes
great
now
i
know
why
cigar
city
has
the
name
it
does
drinkability
im
still
waiting
for
cc
to
miss
on
a
beer
seems
like
they
are
perfect
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
nice
beige
head
sticks
around
for
just
a
moment
aroma
is
strong
of
dark
toasted
malts
and
coffee
coffee
and
more
coffee
taste
follows
suit
with
some
mild
sweetness
somewhere
in
the
background
great
balance
upon
tasting
not
too
over
the
top
on
the
coffee
and
just
a
great
balanced
brown
with
a
twist
along
with
the
typical
cigar
city
complexity
the
cuban
espresso
treatment
is
delicious
and
wonderful
im
still
waiting
for
cigar
city
to
make
a
less
than
world
class
beer
it
may
never
happen
d
very
high
drinkability
damned
tasty
stuff
i
really
like
what
the
coffee
did
to
the
brown
it
was
pretty
good
regular
but
the
coffee
really
adds
a
nice
dimension
that
was
missing
from
the
regular
i
dont
think
it
quite
has
the
zing
of
coffee
bender
but
its
still
damned
good
drinkability
the
body
seems
just
a
hair
thin
to
me
but
the
flavor
is
definitely
there
which
for
me
is
the
important
part
overall
an
enjoyable
brown
ale
drinkability
is
great
excellent
balance
nice
depth
even
better
than
the
regular
maduro
with
the
extra
added
character
and
complexity
from
the
espresso
as
a
coffee
lover
this
one
hit
the
spot
im
definitely
torn
between
this
one
and
the
original
which
i
loved
the
espresso
is
so
dominant
in
this
one
that
it
may
take
away
slightly
from
the
complexity
and
balance
of
the
underlying
maduro
that
said
its
still
head
and
shoulders
above
most
brown
ales
out
there
and
astoundingly
robust
for
the
low
abv

huge
coffee

unlike
any
coffee
beer
i
have
had
as

other
than
weasel
that
make
coffee
work
this
well

the
freshest
and
most
roasted
taste
imaginable
super
dry
very
roasted
and
almost
chewy
mouthfeel
medium

moderate
carbonation
that
allowed
this
beer
to
feel
absolutely
perfect
on
the

very
very
long
time
could
have
drank
this
and
another
growleramazing

like
some
with
my
breakfast

was
hands
down
my
favorite
of

russ
who
wants
to
trade
me
the
vanilla
now
d
and
overall
impression
i
am
a
coffee
lover
so
i
think
the
drinkability
is
impressive
noncoffee
lovers
will
disagree
given
the
sheer
amount
of
espresso
beans
in
this
one
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
by
wayne
and
joey
over
at
ccb
so
smooth
and
at
5
5
breakfast
is
a
great
spot
for
this
one
as
far
as
the
american
brown
ales
i
have
tried
this
one
ranks
right
at
the
top
great
skal
overall
great
blend
of
flavors
here
reminded
me
in
some
ways
of
the
percolator
dopplebock
in
the
range
of
coffee
notes
very
impressed
with
what
is
going
on
down
in
tampa
and
cannot
wait
to
get
home
and
try
the
vanilla
one
tonight
as
i
sip
my
mouth
is
filled
with
everything
i
like
about
a
good
morning
meal
huge
coffee
presence
that
warms
and
soothes
following
this
is
a
mild
breadiness
that
finishes
sweet
and
satisfying
theres
definite
bitterness
in
here
that
is
pleasant
but
the
sweetness
and
the
coffee
are
kings
this
is
an
excellent
brown
i
realize
that
it
is
limited
in
its
release
but
get
some
if
you
can
pours
an
amber
brown
in
color
fairly
clear
with
a
good
sized
light
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
with
a
little
lacing
left
behind
aroma
is
a
nice
fresh
ground
coffee
aroma
nice
and
roasty
a
little
earthy
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
some
colalike
and
light
caramel
sweetness
in
the
nose
blend
with
the
coffee
qualities
taste
follows
the
aroma
fairly
well
some
nice
espresso
characteristics
slightly
bitter
and
dry
but
balanced
by
a
sweeter
cola
and
nutty
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
some
malty
creaminess
mid
taste
and
dry
and
bitter
in
the
finish
i
love
a
good
brown
and
this
definitely
fits
that
description
very
drinkable
delicious
brown
great
for
a
session
and
the
coffee
notes
work
very
well
with
it
very
natural
and
proportionate
thanks
to
jay
for
the
opportunity
keep
doing
what
you
do
guys
d
put
this
one
on
ice
cream
or
in
a
big
gulp
i
can
kick
back
and
gulp
it
until
the
cows
come
home
this
the
bench
mark
for
coffee
brown
ales
like
the
original
maduro
im
still
not
giving
this
offering
high
true
to
style
grades
however
it
does
get
a
high
grade
in
tasty
the
vanilla
adds
a
real
nice
touch
to
this
already
exceptional
brown
ale
and
to
have
it
from
the
nitro
tap
was
awesome
cool
little
taphouse
in
stuart
florida
called
the
crafted
keg
its
so
creamy
looking
darker
than
i
remember
it
from
the
can
and
holding
its
luxurious
milky
head
leaving
rings
at
every
sip
in
the
pint
glass
it
smells
vanilla
heavy
but
not
artificial
at
all
but
some
of
the
roast
seems
tamed
by
the
sweetness
it
brings
the
flavor
holds
true
to
that
and
while
the
vanilla
brings
an
awesome
new
flavor
wrinkle
some
of
what
made
the
original
base
beer
special
is
lost
to
it
just
a
bit
still
its
a
great
base
beer
for
vanilla
and
i
think
the
dosage
is
appropriate
except
the
sweetness
that
it
brings
lingers
on
the
palate
maybe
aided
by
the
nitro
feel
less
aggressive
bubbles
to
wash
the
mouth
clean
fuller
bodied
like
a
porter
more
than
a
brown
ale
as
we
know
them
its
not
a
negative
it
just
limits
how
much
of
this
is
desirable
to
drink
couple
of
pints
tops
for
me
where
regular
maduro
i
was
good
for
a
sixer
no
problem
cool
tweak
less
nutty
more
sweet
equally
delicious
o
easy
drinker
and
i
mean
easy
this
goes
down
smoothly
and
tastes
wonderful
i
had
three
of
these
down
in
a
blink
of
the
eye
never
would
have
thought
a
vanilla
beer
would
be
good
but
this
beer
proved
me
wrong
it
had
a
perfect
balance
of
vanilla
that
was
not
overpowering
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
had
the
chance
this
is
a
surprising
ale
coming
from
florida
i
would
have
never
expected
this
craft
beer
to
come
out
the
way
it
has
it
is
smooth
tasting
and
you
can
even
get
the
vanilla
taste
without
it
being
overwhelming
goes
down
nice
and
no
weird
after
taste
i
had
it
on
nitro
at
nona
tap
room
in
orlando
and
i
felt
that
on
nitro
it
had
a
much
better
feel
and
finish
but
it
is
certainly
a
good
beer
either
way
overall
too
much
vanilla
for
me
o
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
like
the
base
beer
but
this
is
much
better
well
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
on
tap
also
tried
the
nitro
version
way
better
smoother
and
creamy
and
hints
of
vanilla
on
this
one
overall
an
interesting
twist
but
the
base
beer
seems
to
have
much
more
complexity
the
nut
flavors
in
the
base
beer
are
replaced
here
by
fruit
and
vanilla
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
deviation
from
the
maduro
worth
trying
at
least
once
would
recommend
over
abitas
vanilla
double
dog
brown
ale
single
finger
head
with
some
retention
and
excellent
lacing
on
a
murky
deep
amber
brown
body
aroma
is
a
bit
mild
with
toffee
caramel
malts
nuts
and
a
nice
vanilla
presence
flavor
follows
well
with
nuts
chocolate
malts
and
burnt
toast
initially
then
moving
to
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
not
too
sweet
and
well
balanced
this
one
gets
better
as
it
is
enjoyed
too
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
o
i
like
the
base
beer
and
i
thought
this
vanilla
varient
was
really
nice
dont
have
much
to
complain
about
here
really
its
a
solid
session
beer
with
some
complex
flavor
try
some
if
you
get
a
chance
o
good
not
great
maduro
has
never
been
my
favorite
personal
preference
here
as
an
example
of
style
or
for
someone
that
is
seeking
out
an
oatmeal
brown
i
would
highly
recommend
one
but
i
thought
id
give
the
vanilla
variant
a
shot
i
probably
prefer
it
slightly
to
the
base
beer
light
body
light
effervescence
watery
great
taste
but
wtf
with
the
body
i
thought
my
first
cask
would
be
a
no
brainer
given
the
quality
of
brew
in
the
past
o
liked
it
a
lot
didnt
quite
love
it
though
like
i
did
the
cubano
espresso
style
maduro
i
would
absolutely
get
this
again
and
wouldve
taken
a
growler
if
it
was
allowed
sweet
vanilla
finish
really
broke
everything
up
making
this
complex
and
balanced
o
disappointing
i
prefer
the
regular
madura
oits
a
nice
twist
on
what
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
base
beer
still
its
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
dessert
type
beers
on
cask
at
the
tap
room
in
the
pint
glass
a
cloudy
dark
brown
reddish
tinted
with
one
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
spotty
lace
left
behind
smell
a
lot
of
vanilla
overwhelms
chocolate
and
a
slight
nuttiness
taste
vanilla
ice
cream
in
caramel
syrup
lightly
roasted
backdrop
silky
feel
drying
finish
where
some
earthiness
emerges
this
does
a
great
job
of
featuring
vanilla
its
loaded
with
vanilla
but
its
one
note
compared
to
the
awesomeness
that
is
regular
maduro
but
the
vanilla
does
add
to
the
body
and
its
still
drinkable
as
anything
so
so
tasty
just
probably
not
worth
the
extra
cost
of
production
to
put
on
vanilla
ill
take
original
cheers

very
strong
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
oak
chocolately
and
some
roasted
malt
in
the
smell
too
quite
a
sweet
beer
i
found
i
enjoyed
the
first
half
of
the
pint
more
than
the
2nd
half
as
it
was
a
lot
of
vanilla
still
tasted
nice
though
i
appreciate
how
the
vanilla
aging
is
subtle
and
not
overpoweringoverdone
but
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
more
tweaked
and
interesting
also
the
oatmeal
and
brown
aspects
of
it
were
lost

pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
the
slightest
tinge
of
red
to
it
great
foamy
tan

the
aroma
is
very
similar
to
the
regular
version
but
with
a
strong
vanilla
smell
that
takes
center
stage
other
notes
of
dark
malt
subtle
sweetness
cocoa
take
a
back
seat
the
taste
is
all
vanilla
for
the
first
second
then
slowly
transitions
to
the
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
flavors
lingering
taste
of
vanilla
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
an
interesting
addition
in
flavor
to
the
regular
version
very
good
beer
i
could
waste
time
and
space
expounding
on
this
brew
but
why
bother
its
world
class
and
makes
me
wish
i
lived
in
tampa
very
good
beer
overall
im
impressed
with
the
use
of
vanilla
bean
in
that
it
adds
another
dimension
to
a
great
base
beer
without
totally
overwhelming
it
expert
handling
of
the
vanilla
aging
it
really
takes
this
beer
from
pretty
damn
good
to
outstanding
i
might
have
to
drive
down
every
weekend
now
poured
from
growler
into

impressive
brown
with
ruby
color

nice
thick

of
dark
chocolate
roasted

slight

is
spot
on
big
and
roasty
with
chocolate
tobacco
a
hint
of
spice
from
the
hop
and
just
a
slight
faint
taste
of
vanilla
overall
another
impressive
offering
from
cigar
city
its
almost
unfair
to
classify
this
as
a
brown
ale
but
if
you
do
its
great
for
the
style
drinkable
and
really
enjoyable
overall
not
my
favorite
treatment
of
the
maduro
brown
d
delicious
stuff
that
i
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
try
again
my
pint
was
gone
way
too
quick
i
could
see
the
vanilla
being
a
little
much
after
a
couple
pints
though
its
quite
strong
d
almost
perfect
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
again
and
again
overall
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
will
be
getting
this
again
some
time
if
it
is
available
low
abv
thinnish
texture
enhance
the
chug
factor
still
not
my
favorite
treatment
overall
im
not
so
sure
i
dont
like
this
better
without
the
addition
of
vanilla
beans
however
thats
not
to
say
the
addition
isnt
interesting
worth
a
shot
on
tap
at
cigar
city
takes
nyc
event
at
rattle
n
hum
raters
at
my
table
were
not
so
oyyoyyoy
about
the
vanilla
but
i
appreciated
the
vanills
edge
and
smoothnessa
rising
above
the
chocolate
and
making
it
a
decent
drinker
owing
to
it
being
more
on
the
sweeter
side
very
dark
with
a
whisp
of
a
head
suitably
carbonated
d
as
previously
mentioned
i
was
expecting
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
but
was
actually
quite
surprised
by
the
amount
of
vanilla
my
only
complaint
was
the
level
of
sweetness
that
it
provided
but
otherwise
i
found
it
to
be
quite
nice
haha
crazy
32oz

barely
translucent
dark
mahogany
brown

fades
slowly
leaving
sheets
of

behind

like
rich
malty

with
a
vanilla
chaser
it
carries
over
to
the
taste

this
is
a
great

i
would
have
preferred
a
more
vanilla
forward
beer
drinkability
low
abv
medium
body
delicious
flavor
really
drinkable
brew
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
although
high
will
be
limited
by
the
sweetness
from
the
vanilla
overall
yet
another
good
treatment
of
an
already
great
beer
cant
wait
to
see
what
joey
and
wayne
can
come
up
with
next
skal
drinkability
is
great
excellent
balance
nice
depth
even
better
than
the
regular
maduro
with
the
extra
added
character
and
complexity
from
the
vanilla
ill
admit
that
im
generally
not
a
big
fan
of
vanilla
so
i
was
definitely
not
expecting
to
like
this
one
as
much
as
the
other
two
but
it
has
definitely
won
me
over
and
was
my
favourite
of
the
three
this
one
is
a
real
winner
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
ccb
though
i
probably
prefer
the
original
maduro
to
this
one
its
definitely
sweeter
and
less
roasty
but
this
coffeelover
prefers
the
espresso
version
in
the
headtohead
as
well
sweet
vanilla
almost
creamer
in
a
coffeelike
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
caramel
and
light
molasses
starts
off
with
sweeter
caramel
than
the
other
two
versions
vanilla
domiantes
the
middle
with
almost
a
root
beer
or
cream
soda
feel
pretty
bubbly
and
sweet
rounded
the
finish
has
more
vanilla
mixed
with
nuts
and
caramel
it
never
gets
overly
sweet
which
is
nice
instead
it
enhances
what
is
already
there
is
the
brown
ale
and
provides
a
creamier
overall
feel
slightly
sweet
roasted
and
malty
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
moderate
to
high
carbonation
and
especially
for
a
growler
taste
lingers
quite
well
without
being
overbearing
could
have
drank
a
lot
of
this
very
smooth
and
light
feeling
good
drinkability
for
any
kind
of
beer
containing
chocolate
or
vanilla
would
drink
again
worth
trying
pours
a
clear
dark
orangebrown
some
reddish
hints
thin
light
tan
head
forms
settles
down
to
a
thick
ring
touch
less

than
the
regular
but
still
looks
good
smell
is
insane
good
very
fresh
vanilla
tobacco
and
earthy
caramel

sweeter
than
the

nice

is
amazing
big
vanilla
at
first
sweet

nuts
woody

almost
tastes

a

great
vanilla
character
mouthfeel
is
the
same
as
regular
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
insanely
smooth
and
drinkable
wow
this
stuff
is
good
has
a
fine
cigar
and
vanilla
character
to
it
that
i
really
liked
best
of
the
three
we
had
thanks
russ
thanks
again
to
you
fogdog
for
hooking
me
up
with
a
nice
haul
of
ccb
stuff
hopefully
my
return
package
picks
you
up
just
as
much
overall
probably
my
favorite
ccb
beer
yet
overall
very
very
solid
great
use
of
vanilla
here
and
the
light
body
of
the
brown
ale
underneath
still
shines
through
i
would
not
mind
having
this
one
every
once
and
a
while
on
tap
at
a
ccb
event
at
brass
tap
tampa
fl
pours
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
and
thin
offwhite
head
that
settles
quickly
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
lots
of
vanilla
and
notes
of
chocolate
roast
brown
sugar
nuts
and
caramel
flavor
is
also
sweet
and
malty
with
notes
of
vanilla
chocolate
coffee
wood
molasses
caramel
and
some
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
nuts
medium
body
with
a
pleasing
malty
finish
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
be
great
all
night
a
tasty
surprise
during
my
crash
course
in
ccb
at
the
brass
tap
pours
a
deep
rich
brown
color
with
a
tan
one
finger
head
as
i
noticed
in
every
ccb
brew
nice
lacing
is
left
around
the
glass
the
vanilla
hits
you
right
in
the
nose
and
does
so
just
right
it
doesnt
overwhelm
but
it
is
present
and
is
at
the
forefront
the
sweet
caramel
malt
smell
is
still
there
though
vanilla
once
again
dominates
the
taste
but
it
really
works
well
here
this
brown
ale
at
its
core
is
far
more
robust
than
other
brown
ales
i
have
had
there
is
a
strong
malt
backbone
providing
caramel
chocolate
and
even
some
coffee
hints
this
richness
is
paired
perfectly
with
the
vanilla
as
previously
stated
this
is
a
bit
richer
than
your
average
brown
ale
so
a
bit
denser
but
still
highly
drinkable
the
resulting
sweetness
is
about
the
only
thing
that
holds
you
back
from
going
for
too
many
of
these
d
ok
lots
of
vanilla
keeps
me
at
one
or
two
pints
tasty
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
espresso
maduro
i
had
a
few
nights
ago
at
datz
fun
to
sample
but
could
not
drink
a
pint
forgot
to
rate
this
pour
number
50000
or
something
at
hunahpu
day
2013
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
aroma
of
cinnamon
nuts
and
you
guessed
it
oatmeal
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
cinnamon
oatmeal
flavor
with
a
hint
of
raisins
in
the
background
pretty
easy
drinking
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
at
most
maybe
even
light
for
the
style
medium
carbonation
cool
beer
but
i
start
wondering
if
this
is
just
made
with
artificial
flavoring
certainly
tastes
like
they
say
it
will
though
m
goes
down
easy
with
bready
follow
through
o
solid
beer
that
tastes
just
like
an
oatmeal
cookie
it
has
a
slight
bite
to
it
from
the
brown
ale
o
i
wasnt
sure
how
much
i
was
going
to
like
this
beer
im
a
fan
of
oatmeal
raisin
cookies
but
was
skeptical
that
this
was
going
to
remotely
taste
like
one
fortunately
cigar
city
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
very
reminiscent
of
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
without
being
overly
sweet
or
artificial
tasting
a
fun
beer
to
try
and
one
i
would
certainly
be
happy
to
have
again
it
sounds
like
a
cheap
novelty
beer
to
increase
sales
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
one
this
is
a
great
sweet
tasting
beer
it
smells
like
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
tastes
like
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
but
its
not
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
its
hard
to
put
down
and
very
easy
to
buy
another
pint
the
beer
pours
a
clear
mahogany
brown
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
a
subtle
oatmeal
cookie
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
cinnamonnutmeg
spice
vanilla
extractmarshmallow
and
raisins
the
taste
is
a
relatively
sweet
but
not
cloying
followed
by
an
exact
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
mildmedium
bodied
flat
with
a
lingering
brown
sugar
sweetness
this
definitely
lives
up
to
its
name
but
needs
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
body
o
orc
is
a
really
good
brown
ale
with
all
the
right
flavors
of
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
exceptionally
drinkable
and
tasty
as
can
be
overall
this
brown
ale
is
something
special
well
done
cigar
city
and
thank
you
matt
i
could
never
forget
this
one
the
beer
is
brown
with
minimal
head
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
oatmeal
cookies
all
the
way
cinnamon
brown
sugar
cookie
dough
sweet
malt
delectable
and
delicious
shockingly
reminiscent
of
a
real
genuine
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
the
name
doesnt
lie
a
bit
of
a
one
trick
pony
however
this
becomes
cloying
quickly
a
small
sample
is
perfect
light
and
delicate
flavor
profile
slight
sweetness
along
with
artificial
raisin
and
oatmeal
malt
lends
a
cookielike
flavor
as
well
low
carbonation
and
a
light
velvety
mouthfeel
great
novelty
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
body
to
it
overall
it
really
does
smell
like
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
unfortunately
the
taste
isnt
great
its
more
of
a
novelty
beer
and
not
something
youd
want
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
worth
trying
once
for
sure
o
a
good
and
enjoyable
brew
but
nothing
that
id
actively
seek
out
good
but
not
worth
trading
for
overall
this
was
very
well
done
despite
the
miniscule
body
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
32
ounce
growler
in
secret
halloween
2011
the
pour
is
reddish
brown
with
a
beutiful
white
head
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
figs
raisins
the
beer
is
definitely
sweet
raisins
figs
the
beer
has
a
lingering
sweetness
to
it
it
has
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
a
nice
take
on
a
brown
ale
enjoyable
o
a
really
nice
brown
ale
and
unique
too
ccb
is
really
good
at
these
maduro
variants
and
this
one
may
be
the
best
definitely
worth
trying
any
time
you
get
the
chance
overall
very
different
and
very
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
two
back
to
back
cheers
o
ccbs
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
wasnt
quite
what
id
hoped
for
yet
it
was
a
pretty
reasonable
attempt
at
a
unique
boutique
beer
i
would
very
much
like
to
have
this
again
from
a
properly
carbonated
tap
and
not
immediately
following
a
generous
pour
of
isabelle
proximus
overall
this
was
a
good
one
to
try
a
little
too
much
oatmeal
raisin
for
my
tastes
deep
mohagony
brown
with
a
nice
khaki
colored
foam
definitely
smell
the
maduro
brown
base
some
of
the
brown
sugars
bit
raisiny
some
cookie
crust
notes
never
would
have
guessed
but
the
label
tells
all
tastes
just
like
an
oatmeal
cookie
damn
light
somewhat
creamy
tasting
just
cant
get
the
cookie
impression
off
my
mind
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
had
me
wanting
more
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
darker
beers
like
this
brown
ale
but
i
must
say
i
was
very
impressed
and
wouldnt
mind
giving
this
beer
another
go
at
all
highly
recommended
gfunk
o
drink
it
for
what
it
is
it
tastes
like
a
cookie
not
like
beer
hardly
beer
but
awesome
for
what
it
is
the
mouth
has
just
the
right
amount
of
thickness
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
a
twofinger
light
tan
head
aroma
of
cinnamon
raisons
and
a
hint
of
maduro
wrapper
i
find
in
all
of
cigar
citys
brown
ales
flavor
is
oatmeal
raison
cookie
spot
on
a
bit
heavier
on
the
spices
than
the
sweetness
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
raisons
primarily
finishes
with
the
sweetness
hints
of
vanilla
which
bring
the
cookie
flavor
all
the
way
around
o
after
trying
a
lot
of
ccbs
nontraditional
offerings
this
one
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
mainly
because
there
is
no
other
beer
out
there
like
it
and
the
quality
that
is
is
made
to
perfect
flavors
make
this
an
any
time
of
dayyear
beer
overall
pretty
good
not
as
amazing
as
i
was
hoping
but
it
could
be
because
of
the
beginnings
of
an
infection
or
age
but
not
sure
the
nose
was
great
but
the
dry
light
yeast
and
fruit
like
taste
takes
a
bit
from
the
taste
but
otherwise
nice
and
maybe
slightly
over
carbonated
but
its
awesome
i
like
overall
impression
perhaps
its
a
bit
kitschy
but
cigar
city
has
done
pretty
well
at
emulating
a
cookie
in
a
beer
its
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
want
it
all
the
time
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
this
isnt
a
disgusting
beer
but
i
was
unable
to
find
any
signs
of
raisin
and
the
overall
beer
seems
to
have
some
flaws
its
more
of
a
curiosity
than
an
actual
solid
beer
solid
brown
ale
different
yet
solid
o
i
was
a
little
worried
at
first
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
smell
at
all
but
thankfully
the
taste
saved
it
this
stuff
really
is
like
drinking
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
thats
worth
picking
up
if
you
ever
see
it
oim
not
a
brown
ale
fan
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
brings
back
so
many
memories
of
childhood
that
it
is
hard
not
to
love
this
o
this
beer
is
weird
i
dont
really
like
oatmeal
raisin
cookies
so
im
not
surprised
i
dont
like
this
but
the
flavor
just
seems
too
strange
to
fit
with
beer
o
obsessed
with
this
beer
cant
get
enough
of
it
wish
they
could
distribute
to
ca
i
would
spend
every
last
penny
on
this
brewery
d
brown
ales
arent
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
pretty
darn
good
the
one
bottle
i
had
went
down
way
too
easily
and
i
could
put
down
several
more
if
they
were
available
next
time
i
come
across
these
there
wont
be
any
left
on
the
self
its
just
a
fun
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
i
hope
cigar
city
gets
their
qc
issues
fixed
flat
zhukov
infected
maduro
now
infected
raisin
cookie
at
least
hunahpu
lives
up
to
the
hype
poured
ontap
at
the
cigar
city
brewing
tasting
room
in
tampa
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
has
the
same
body
and
color
of
maduro
brown
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
light
thin
foamy
head
smells
like
an
oatmeal
creme
pie
which
made
this
fat
kid
very
happy
my
poor
pregnant
wife
hates
me
right
now
slight
cinnamon
aroma
too
and
the
smell
is
amazing
the
taste
is
great
the
flavor
has
a
baked
sugary
sweetness
cinnamon
spicing
and
creamy
undertones
wow
all
of
this
while
remaining
light
bodied
brownsugar
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
quick
clean
finish
delicious
would
make
a
wicked
milkshake
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
abv
is
hidden
perfectly
in
this
brew
quite
drinkable
with
a
pleasant
contrast
of
flavors
i
didnt
quite
pick
up
on
the
oat
quality
i
was
anticipating
in
this
brew
but
the
spiced
and
raisin
flavors
were
quite
fitting
of
the
name
certainly
worth
a
try
cigar
city
continues
to
impress
me
this
beer
looks
like
any
other
maduro
but
its
not
the
aroma
is
that
of
cinnamon
oats
and
large
grains
of
sugar
and
boy
oh
boy
is
the
best
yet
to
come
i
know
this
kind
of
sentiment
is
tossed
around
a
lot
on
ba
but
i
have
never
drank
anything
that
is
closer
to
a
liquified
dessert
than
this
it
absolutely
captures
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
of
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
without
any
of
the
crumbs
big
molasses
sweetness
cinnamon
raisin
grain
this
to
me
is
the
perfect
example
of
what
a
brown
ale
can
aspire
to
be
bravo
cigar
city
this
is
the
maduro
to
try
medium
body
medium
carbonation
slightly
thin
but
still
coating
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
little
unusual
but
delivers
exactly
whats
advertised
d
mission
accomplished
id
say
this
is
a
liquid
cookie
seriously
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
the
taste
and
smell
make
you
want
that
chewy
oatmeal
texture
in
every
sip
o
a
nice
novelty
beer
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
but
just
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
pours
a
very
deep
burgundy
brown
with
a
bit
of
head
from
the
start
but
the
head
dies
off
almost
instantly
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
barely
visible
to
see
through
but
it
is
not
like
its
motor
oil
stout
relative
smells
at
first
like
it
has
a
dark
cherry
and
a
slight
vanilla
bean
flavor
infused
into
it
and
then
a
cinnamon
warmness
follows
taking
deeper
inhales
it
almost
smells
like
an
apple
pie
with
tons
of
cinnamon
infused
into
it
admittedly
brown
ales
never
muster
much
a
smile
from
my
face
because
they
all
seem
rather
bland
to
me
but
this
one
is
surprisingly
tasty
taste
is
a
very
nutty
brown
ale
with
just
a
touch
of
some
dark
stone
fruits
the
cinnamon
and
raisin
contributions
are
very
light
to
the
taste
and
play
really
nicely
into
the
overall
flavor
of
the
beer
with
more
and
more
sips
you
realize
there
is
a
nice
tingling
in
your
throat
i
think
partly
to
the
subtle
carbonation
but
also
from
the
cinnamon
cigar
city
really
set
the
bar
with
this
brown
ale
to
make
it
interesting
to
the
palatein
a
rather
boring
field
but
to
also
balance
the
spice
profile
and
not
make
it
a
bomb
of
cinnamon
the
mouthfeel
is
light
due
to
the
not
over
robust
carbonation
and
as
mentioned
before
the
nice
light
play
from
the
spice
added
to
the
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
for
the
style
and
wish
more
brown
ales
tasted
as
good
as
this
one
i
wouldnt
pass
on
them
as
much
then
overall
interesting
brew
but
ones
enough
for
me
pretty
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
because
it
really
is
quite
unique
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
high
i
liked
the
thicker
mouthfeel
but
the
carbonation
didnt
fit
for
me
overall
it
was
an
interesting
beer
but
a
not
very
drinkable
one
it
felt
pretty
sweet
overall
which
i
guess
should
be
expected
given
the
name
the
spices
in
the
finish
were
a
little
overpowering
and
the
tart
fruity
flavors
didnt
fit
either
again
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
id
want
to
drink
very
often
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
oatmeal
raisin
cookies
but
doesnt
so
much
smell
like
it
if
you
like
those
flavors
then
definitely
try
overall
a
great
way
to
finish
the
night
it
was
like
dessert
in
a
glass
otastes
stay
through
the
entire
glass
for
a
brown
ale
this
is
just
amazing
and
unique
everyone
needs
to
get
some
of
this
thanks
again
dolfan84
overall
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
with
a
twist
a
nice
take
on
a
desert
beer
and
i
would
love
to
have
another
in
the
future
overall
its
a
one
try
for
me
i
cant
get
past
the
burnt
malty
taste
mouthfeel
is
great
and
smell
could
have
been
more
complex
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
lighter
brown
mahogany
edging
decent
light
tan
head
that
was
retained
for
a
few
minutes
minor
lacing
this
beer
does
smell
like
cookies
mostly
hot
raisins
cinnamon
and
vanilla
there
is
a
nice
roastiness
to
the
flavour
along
with
what
i
smelled
in
the
nose
the
raisins
come
through
as
well
as
the
other
spices
mainly
cinammon
nutmeg
and
vanilla
mouth
was
a
touch
over
carbonated
in
my
opinion
medium
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
i
liked
the
concept
the
cookie
recipe
wasnt
played
up
and
was
a
nice
mix
of
spices
and
smells
aroma
is
both
fruiter
and
nuttier
than
the
original
maduro
brown
is
a
dash
of
spice
and
some
chocolate
rounds
out
a
solid
brown
ale
nose
flavor
picks
up
some
cinnamon
that
accentuates
a
dry
finish
a
nutty
and
slightly
chocolatey
malt
base
backs
up
a
sweet
mid
palate
with
a
grape
like
flavor
coming
from
the
raisins
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
the
exotic
ingredients
seem
to
be
added
with
a
very
gentle
hand
as
this
doesnt
taste
over
the
top
at
all
the
flavors
of
cookies
are
all
there
but
it
doesnt
come
together
to
actually
taste
like
the
cookie
still
a
nice
treat
with
some
freshly
baked
oatmeal
raisin
cookies
pours
a
dark
raisin
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
bubbled
off
quickly
but
the
rush
of
carbonation
bubbles
from
the
bottom
kept
a
small
part
afloat
for
a
good
while
the
beer
also
left
a
great
ring
of
lacing
around
the
glass
the
beer
smelled
almost
identical
to
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
not
sure
if
the
name
clouded
my
judgment
but
the
smell
was
right
on
point
to
a
fresh
out
of
the
oven
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
also
faint
smells
of
vanilla
and
ginger
the
taste
was
very
sweet
reminded
me
of
an
oatmeal
cookie
with
a
vanilla
icing
with
cinnamon
sprinkled
on
top
the
biggest
let
down
of
the
beer
was
the
thin
body
that
held
this
back
from
being
a
top
tier
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
another
great
offering
from
cigar
city
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
cigar
city
beers
in
the
future
d
not
bad
for
a
brown
ale
had
no
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
at
least
give
it
a
try
but
a
pretty
solid
beer
by
cigar
city
overall
one
of
the
great
offerings
from
ccb
loved
the
chance
to
try
this
one
on

o

redhook
puts
out
a
brew
that
is
drinkable

not

o
nice

for
the

nothing
too
fancy
pours
a
hazy
dark

with

foamy

taste
is

same
with
toast
and
nutty
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
some
decent
aromas
and
flavors
for
the
style
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
one
what
a
nasty
beer
it
smells
funny
and
finding
out
its
a
english
brown
ale
is
a
big
dissappointment
it
lack
the
bite
the
taste
ande
makeup
to
be
called
a
english
brown
ale
fails
big
time
doesnt
even
look
good
in
a
glas
i
love
english
brown
ales
this
doesnt
even
close
to
any
of
them
skip
it
and
drink
anpther
because
no
effect
was
put
into
this
this
beer
had
its
moments
but
it
was
missing
something
a
bit
more
flavor
i
would
have
rated
it
higher
than
a
3
5
which
may
have
a
bit
generous
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
displayed
a
clear
medium
brown
brew
with
a
half
finger
head
the
aroma
picked
up
was
roasted
sweetness
and
a
little
malt
background
taste
was
simple
with
nothing
stepping
forward
roasted
malts
sugar
and
a
little
hint
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
nice
and
overall
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
ive
had
worse
and
ive
had
much
better
was
looking
to
try
this
for
a
while
but
its
not
something
id
seek
out
but
then
again
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
a
slightly
more
aggressive
brown
ale
than
the
usual
suspects
that
touch
of
burnt
barley
helps
it
stand
out
there
is
something
too
sweet
and
fruity
with
that
woodsy
bitterness
to
be
very
drinkable
in
the
22
oz
bottle
from
del
mission
liquor
on
washington
near
hillcrest
in
san
diego
which
has
a
suprisingly
good
and
fresh
supply
of
craft
beers
an
enjoyable
brown
ale
dammit
why
cant
we
have
clean
respectful
political
dialogue
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunrise
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlyfunky
wheat
stuck
in
an
old
semidried
pool
of
maple
syrup
the
taste
holds
notes
of
old
maple
syrup
dry
toffee
light
brown
sugar
light
cocoa
powder
and
a
twinge
of
sweet
biscuit
theres
a
vague
sense
of
candied
orange
peel
throughout
but
it
never
settles
long
enough
for
me
to
get
a
good
enough
idea
of
its
existence
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
fluid
feel
overall
a
weak
bit
of
englishstyle
sweetness
that
doesnt
meld
well
within
itself
much
less
on
my
tongue
overall
not
a
bad
brown
from
red
hook
here
in
fact
its
pretty
darn
solid
something
id
give
thought
to
buying
again
especially
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
which
is
rare
overall
pretty
enjoyable
and
a
fine
option
if
you
kinda
want
a
brown
ale
but
arent
sure
that
you
want
a
really
brown
ale
overall
well
its
not
offensive
and
it
is
ok
but
its
lack
of
smooth
transitions
and
its
rather
weak
mouthfeel
would
likely
prevent
me
from
recommending
this
one
to
others
just
ok
overall
not
nearly
as
rich
as
its
name
may
imply
and
is
in
fact
a
highly
accessible
drinkable
beer
which
may
be
best
enjoyed
in
warmer
weather
o
this
ones
kind
of
a
stinker
not
tasty
not
fitting
the
style
just
odd
eh
decent
brown
but
not
really
anything
overly
exciting
feel
is
overall
smooth
overall
super
easy
to
drink
even
if
it
is
a
little
too
lightly
flavored
for
my
taste
still
i
would
buy
again
sometime
when
i
just
want
a
mild
brown
ale
at
a
good
price
o
not
well
aquainted
with
the
nut
brown
ale
style
but
if
this
is
average
to
good
then
i
like
em
o
a
decent
enough
brown
serviceable
and
sessionable
i
certainly
prefer
this
beer
over
newcastle
but
with
the
grainysweet
taste
and
texture
the
dryness
and
alcohol
that
i
would
have
normally
applauded
seems
to
highlight
the
waivering
malt
body
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
reminds
me
of
a
crisp
spring
morning
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
40
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
great
big
tan
head
the
beer
had
a
red
color
to
it
also
the
beer
had
a
slightly
sweet
taste
and
unfortunately
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
also
or
after
taste
i
should
say
i
will
not
buy
again

at

to
drink

a
nice

brews

yourself
off

brews

its
in
no
way
a
fluffly
prance
through
a
spring

its
coming
up
the
middle
on
the
edge
of
a
knife
the
color
is
a
smashing

color
the
smell
is
a
mildly
smokey
chocolate
barley
the
taste
is
a
rich
smokey
chocolate
i
thinl
mud
slinger
is
more
spacifically
an
end
of
winter
beginning
of
spring
ale
unless
you
are
just
hardcore
and
wanna
drink
the
rich
stuff
year
round
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
an
out
of
the
box
way
to
embrace
spring
ales
o
a
better
than
average
beer
overall
they
were
shooting
for
a
spring
brown
ale
and
they
did
a
good
job
they
still
used
those
caramel
flavors
that
you
expect
from
an
english
brown
but
managed
to
create
a
drinkable
beer
i
popped
the
cap
gave
it
a
pour
and
had
the
briefest
finger
of
lighttan
head
in
a
while
color
was
a
garnetred
with
ne
quality
clarity
nose
was
very
sweet
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
so
for
this
hophead
caramellike
in
its
intensity
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
had
a
caramel
sweetness
in
the
mouth
but
not
overwhelming
as
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
finish
was
sweet
but
again
not
overwhelmingly
so
i
would
not
want
a
steady
diet
of
this
but
as
an
occasional
changeup
sure
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
overall
a
easy
session
beer
no
flaws
noted
a
nice
clean
simple
beer
o
very
clean
taste
with
not
much
aftertaste
its
a
simple
beer
seems
to
be
well
crafted
and
id
grab
this
for
the
springsummer
months

its

theres
nothing

enough
to

worth
trying
at
all
mo
a
great
beer
for
the
price
and
pretty
good
overall
i
would
definitely
go
to
this
one
again
oa
nice
brown
ale
i
would
like
a
little
less
hop
astringency
and
maybe
less
carbonation
and
a
heavier
mouthfeel
but
this
is
a
good
value
for
the
price
lighter
bodied
than
expected
but
moderately
drinkable
overall
not
bad
just
not
great
dont
really
hate
this
but
there
are
many
better
overall
i
will
be
doing
no
mud
slinging
here
i
liked
it
sure
you
dont
get
a
vastly
complex
malt
character
or
a
sizzling
hop
profile
and
theres
no
room
or
real
need
for
any
wild
barrelaging
im
totally
fine
with
that
its
just
a
simple
decent
balanced
brown
d
an
interesting
if
mild
brown
yet
drinkable
enough
toasty
but
not
overly
nutty
malts
are
quite
dry
are
balanced
against

hops
play
a
supporting
but
noticeable
role
a
solid
offering
o
drinkable
malty
brown
ale
slightly
underwhelming
would
be
very
tasty
with
a
grilled
cheese
sandwich

its
an

i
was

a

from
this

from
other
reviews
i
wasnt

impressed
by
it
this
is
my
first
redhook
ale
beer
and
im
a
little
skeptical
about
buying
a
different
brew
from
them
d
at
first
i
didnt
see
this
as
a
spring
ale
but
when
put
with
grilling
bbq
and
outdoors
it
makes
sense
a
good
campfire

sure

mudlsinger
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
considering
i
had
it
at
a
bar
that
has
limited
options
in
the
good
beer
department
i
certainly
didnt
complain
overall

it
doesnt

again

the

i
was
surprised
in
its

for
me
it
made
it

i
dont

overly

it
had

i
could
have

i

the

really
dont
interest
me
in

is
a

i
probably
wouldnt

goodtasting
and
easy

on

than
i
expected
also
it
seems
to
be
highly
carbonated
which
is
in
stark
contrast
to
the
appearance
the
beer
seems
thinner
because
of
this
the
overall
flavor
is
relatively
weak
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
interesting
or
complicated
d
well
the
light
body
lends
to
drinkability
pretty
decent
overall
and
met
my
expectations
for
a
redhook
brew
thinbodied
and
certainly
drinkable
but
an
average
offering
at
best
d
decent
beer
not
overly
complex
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
my
glass
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
as
someone
else
said
this
will
be
okay
for
a
backyard
bbq
because
its
drinkability
and
low
abv
will
make
it
sessionable
if
its
paired
with
some
heavily
bbqd
chicken
but
if
you
have
some
nice
steaks
id
go
with
something
else
and
make
a
meal
out
of
it
d
a
nice
refreshing
brew
with
a
good
aroma
good
for
kicking
back
grilling
out
in
the
cold
drinks
okay
this
is
a
hohum
kind
of
brown
i
expected
not
much
from
rad

glads
this
was
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
otherwise
i
wouldve
passed
if
you
like
brown

ales
in

give
this
a
try
d
a

american
brown
ale
with
not
a

straddles
the
fence
between
being

robust
and
flavorful
to
compete
with
the
crisp
simple
spring
seasonals
of
the
world
and
being

light
and
crisp
to
be

what
must
be

is
a
deep
burgundy
with

that
remains
for
a
while
mud
slinger
smells
malty
hops
and
just
a
hint
of
nuttiness
its
lightly
sweet
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
the
malts
the
mouth
feel
is
lightly
carbonated
chewy
and
viscous
the
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
from
the
hops
is
the
last
thing
on
your
palate
honestly
the
flavour
could
be
more
nutty
since
it
aspires
to
be
a
brown
ale
and
the
finish
keeps
this
otherwise
good
offering
from
being
great
good
drinkability
refreshing
and
subtle
but
i
didnt
detect
any
nuttiness
maybe
mine
was
a
bit
past
its
prime
d
good
hoppy
session
beer
without
giving
you
ipa
funk
on
the
tongue
overall
this
beer
is
has
a
bold
malty
notes
with
a
subtle
hoppy
tones
it
has
a
really
nice
flavor
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
like
it
for
being
a
mass
marketed
brew
however
im
a
sucker
for
that
warm
cereal
smell
even
if
it
seems
out
of
place
on
this
mahoganycolored
beer
too
bad
the
rest
of
this
one
is
too
blasé
to
bother
with
there
is
really
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
was
a
strawberry
fruit
smoothie
not
usually
a
good
thing
for
a
nut
brown
ale
light
malts
are
pushed
to
the
background
by
a
light
fruity
flavor
which
really
implies
it
has
no
strong
flavor
aspect
at
all
yea
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
again
it
is
not
that
hard
to
stand
out
against
the
totally
unimpressively
light
malt
body
flavor
and
mouthfeel
this
was
an
impulse
sixpack
purchase
a
couple
days
ago
and
i
am
already
thinking
how
to
dispose
of
the
remaining
four
bottles
i
am
sure
someone
will
drink
them
but
it
sure
as
hell
wont
be
me
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
not
quite
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
caramel
and
not
much
else
it
is
a
very
simple
aroma
for
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
boringly
simple
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
this
is
a
nice
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
is
everything
i
have
come
to
expect
from
redhook
mediocrity
while
it
isnt
horrible
i
cant
see
myself
turning
to
this
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
spring
offering
that
pretty
much
sums
it
this
pretty
much
has
a
cloying
sweetness
that
really
detracts
there
is
nothing
here
that
resembles
a
brown
ale
with
a
name
like
mudslinger
i
was
expecting
something
more
roasted
with
some
chocolate
for
some
reason
nothing
like
that
here
not
the
worst
thing
ever
but
nothing
to
seek
out
i
would
not
recommend
this
overall
if
they
called
this
a
dark
pale
ale
the
number
scores
would
have
been
a
little
higher
but
whats
the
purpose
not
a
horrible
beer
but
not
one
i
can
recommend
either

overall
this
beer
wasnt
a
let
down
because
i
wasnt
expecting
much
this
beer
just
didnt
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
it
is
drinkable
since
it
is
so
small
but
nothing
i
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
d
very
sessionable
since
its
such
an
easygoing
beer
this
is
on
the
good
side
of
inoffensive
not
interesting
but
drinkable
d
despite
my
grievances
about
the
mouthfeel
the
light
flavors
and
thin
body
helped
this
beer
go
down
very
easily
i
drank
four
before
i
realized
how
fast
i
was
putting
them
away
a
fairly
good
session
beer
and
it
would
be
even
easier
to
drink
in
warmer
weather
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
its
reasonably
sessionable
if
you
can
get
past
the
slight
cloying
nature
with
deschutes
buzzsaw
recently
retired
this
one
fills
that
early
spring
brown
ale
void
pretty
well
it
may
be
the
best
redhook
brew
i
have
had
ill
probably
pick
up
some
more
of
this
in
season
especially
on
sale
a
little
early
for
a
springer
beer
in
mid
january
but
i
wont
let
that
stop
me
appearance
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
fair
head
and
good
lace
smell
of
malt
caramel
a
little
molasses
and
nutty
taste
is
woodsy
with
the
caramel
malt
having
a
low
hop
to
it
and
there
is
something
else
there
that
i
just
cant
put
my
buds
on
but
leaves
a
cloying
mouthfeel
is
medium
that
goes
down
slick
with
the
low
carbonation
still
has
a
little
heaviness
to
it
that
makes
me
call
it
more
of
a
late
winter
than
a
spring
beer
d
a
mellow
beer
probably
built
around
drinkability
but
the
bottle
i
had
was
pretty
bland
smell
is
of
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
roast
with
a
light
citrus
finish
unfortunately
the
taste
does
not
carry
through
as
pleasantly
the
beer
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
with
mud
actually
added
in
an
unfortunate
theme
for
what
i
was
hoping
would
be
a
decent
ale
glad
i
bought
just
the
one
bottle
d
fairly
drinkable
at
5
2
but
the
malt
and
fruit
becomes
a
little
cloying
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
clear
brown
with
an
orangereddish
hue
and
a
thin
skim
of
a
cap
mostly
just
a
collar
around
the
glass
sweet
aroma
nutty
and
brown
sugar
bread
and
biscuit
the
flavour
was
thin
bitterness
was
higher
and
more
aggressive
than
the
malt
could
balance
notes
of
grass
and
mint
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
coarse
not
something
ill
go
in
search
of
but
not
all
bad
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
pretty
standard
english
brown
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
would
prefer
some
more
earthy
characteristics
pours
a
clear
copper
with
no
head
or
lace
the
aroma
is
caramel
with
hints
of
nuts
and
wood
the
flavor
is
caramel
and
nutty
with
root
beer
barrel
candy
flavor
in
the
finish
theres
also
a
mild
hop
bite
at
the
front
that
fades
as
it
warms
its
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
redhook
nut
brown
is

12oz
bottle
pours
a
nutty
medium
brown
color
with
no
head
zero
lacing
aromas
of
earth
brown
sugar
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
a
sweet

up

with
some
earth
and
hints
of
chocolate
liight
thin

caramel
malt
aftertaste
not
much
elsee
to
say
about
this
one
overall
nothing
special
and
no
need
to
have
it
again
this
one
pours
out
a
redbrown
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
weak
and
primarily
chocolatey
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
nuttiness
a
bit
thin
smelling
the
taste
is
that
of
a
solid
brown
ale
a
solid
malty
backbone
a
bit
of
chocolate
a
slight
amount
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
on
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
smooth
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
overall
its
an
alright
and
fairly
enjoyable
beer
but
theres
nothing
here
to
hook
into
you
overall
just
another
twist
on
a
style
that
isnt
well
respected
i
love
a
well
constructed
brown
ale
as
they
can
be
delicious
this
isnt
one
of
them
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
nothing
overly
special
to
note
about
the
flavor
or
aroma
of
this
beer
though
the
nuttiness
is
pleasantly
pronounced
overall
a
pretty
basic
beer
which
was
actually
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
special
this
beer
poured
a
caramel
colored
body
with
a
small
head
and
a
small
umbrella
of
lacing
smell
was
on
the
weak
side
other
then
some
roasted
nuts
caramel
and
a
slight
hop
aroma
taste
followed
closely
behind
but
the
finish
is
somewhat
unpleasing
my
guess
is
it
was
overpowered
by
the
spices
still
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
an
overall
decent
beer
o
looks
and
feels
good
but
lacks
taste
and
smell
o
well
made
nice
flavour
just
wish
there
was
something
more
to
it
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
its
easy
drinking
and
decent
tasting
but
i
expected
better
from
redhook
it
could
have
a
deeper
flavor
and
thicker
mouthfeel
pours
a
rusty
brown
color
with
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
trace
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
artificial
chocolate
and
caramel
tastes
are
more
of
the
artificial
chocolate
flavorings
somewhat
medicinal
with
some
caramel
brown
sugar
and
faint
nuttiness
in
the
mix
finishing
with
some
herbal
hops
thin
body
decent
carbonation
overall
nothing
special
going
on
here
kind
of
bland
and
i
cant
get
over
the
artificial
flavors
im
getting
a
medium
bodied
ale
with
a
light
nut
roasted
malt
dryish
aftertaste
i
think
this
is
a
really
great
beer
that
is
largely
underrated
it
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
especially
great
for
the
value
i
paid
7
49
for
a
12
pack
i
love
buying
cool
expensive
beer
but
its
nice
to
find
a
great
tasting
reasonably
priced
beer
i
may
be
biased
as
a
lover
of
brown
ales
but
i
think
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
my
only
critique
is
that
it
might
be
a
tiny
tiny
bit
too
sweet
other
than
that
the
taste
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
nutty
malty
with
a
tad
bit
of
sweet
chocolateyness
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
not
bad
overall
an
okay
brown
that
is
pretty
drinkable
but
id
choose
another
option
given
the
chance
overall
as
a
whole
this
is
a
decent
nut
brown
ale
it
feels
a
little
too
light
bodied
but
it
has
a
good
taste
profile
and
is
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
although
theres
nothing
overly
special
in
the
taste
except
for
it
being
quite
nutty
very
light
carbonation
easy
drinker
nice
taste
nicely
done
o
smell
is
better
than
the
taste
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
warming
it
is
is
sufficient
however
the
alcohol
bite
not
well
hidden
and
is
too
much
for
me
d
more
akin
to
a
euro
dark
lager
considering
the
body
and
relative
straight
laced
grain
only
flavor
profile
not
offensive
however
and
pretty
drinkable
head
to
head
with
sammy
or
hobgoblin
or
any
english
brown
and
most
american
offerings
this
one
would
be
a
figgity
fizzail
or
fizzale
d
its
got
some
read
hints
of
potential
though
as
is
its
not
good
at
all
ill
pass
in
the
future
i
have
to
ask
where
do
the
nuts
come
in
its
not
nutty
at
all
overall
not
a
bad
brown
ale
although
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
overall
this
is
a
quite
tasty
and
pleasing
brown
ale
understated
yet
interestingly
complex
its
stylistically
spoton
and
pretty
tasty
too
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overpowering
i
consider
this
an
enjoyable
and
representative
brown
ale
welldone
cool
old
style
bottle
i
liked
this
one
pours
a
lighter
shade
for
a
brown
ale
can
tell
its
an
english
style
right
away
decent
off
white
head
good
aroma
of
medium
roasted
malts
flavor
is
well
blanced
lighter
than
a
lot
of
browns
but
a
nice
palate
a
little
bittersweet
in
the
finish
like
mild
hops
meets
semisweet
chocolate
chips
its
pleasant
and
subtle
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
for
a
brown
in
my
book
but
it
works
just
fine
here
nice
carbonation
and
a
good
finish
an
underrated
beer
on
here
in
my
opinion
very
sessionable
o
smooth
full
bodied
a
decent
brown
ale
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
id
drink
again
love
the
antique
bottle
look
it
doesnt
really
hit
the
brown
ale
category
fairly
average
ale
overall
a
sessionable
beer
but
very
lackluster
for
the
style
pouts
a
transparent
hazelnut
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
composed
of
fairly
large
bubbles
head
retention
is
less
than
average
slight
lacing
is
left
in
my
glass
aroma
is
roasty
sweet
and
earthy
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
the
style
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
roasted
malt
nuttiness
earthy
hops
carbonation
is
average
i
think
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
it
doesnt
stack
up
against
the
leading
brown
ales
however
if
you
just
want
an
enjoyable
amberbrown
beer
red
hooks
nut
brown
would
be
a
great
choice
definitely
worth
buying
twice
can
not
argue
with
the
price
these
folks
are
converting
large
numbers
and
are
due
some
respect
d
pretty
good
take
on
the
style
and
an
easy
drinker
i
havent
seen
this
one
around
lately
though
i
hope
they
dont
stop
making
it
the
pour
was
simply
great
rich
dark
brown
in
color
with
some
nice
bits
of
light
shining
through
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
smallish
head
rises
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
gradually
settles
down
into
a
thin
but
nicely
placed
pad
of
foam
aroma
is
caramel
malts
hints
of
roasted
nuts
and
a
nice
shot
of
piney
hops
well
put
together
and
definitly
more
robust
then
i
thought
it
would
be
as
i
take
the
first
sip
a
light
to
medium
body
washes
over
me
and
thoroughly
impresses
with
its
depth
caramel
bready
tones
hints
of
light
hops
all
seem
to
come
together
nearly
perfectly
as
it
fades
in
and
out
of
the
palate
really
easy
to
drink
and
superbly
sessionable
i
had
no
issue
at
all
with
finishing
this
one
off
drinkability
very
nice
beer
i
would
buy
again
goes
down
nice
without
the
overbearing
citric
flavor
redhook
has
had
in
previous
styles
nitro
can
often
mask
the
aroma
of
a
beer
and
by
extension
its
taste
that
might
appear
to
be
the
case
here
as
this
ale
has
very
little
flavor
to
speak
of
and
this
leaves
some
unfulfilled
expectations
for
the
style
all
that
can
really
be
tasted
is
a
dry
allpurpose
flour
and
water
mix
with
a
sawdusted
finish
it
might
be
said
that
the
minimal
flavor
at
least
achieves
a
certain
benign
cleanliness
but
theres
nothing
sweet
or
nutty
here
and
the
malts
lend
no
enticement
or
pizzazz
opinion
this
beer
is
alright
i
am
a
big
malthead
so
i
like
that
it
is
malt
balanced
however
it
is
really
underattenuated
i
think
that
it
could
be
a
good
bit
more
dry
and
leave
out
the
roast
but
that
is
just
my
opinion
ill
certainly
finish
my
glass
but
this
isnt
one
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
in
the
future
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
but
it
is
not
anything
special
cheers
thought
it
was
pretty
decent
beer
just
weak
in
comparison
to
what
i
expect
a
good
brown
ale
to
be
malty
for
sure
with
a
light
caramelly
toffee
malt
base
and
a
mild
nutty
chocolatey
undertone
balanced
with
bittering
hops
but
no
real
flavor
or
aroma
from
hops
medium
body
but
thins
toward
the
end
finishes
pretty
clean
and
crisp
for
a
malty
beer
weak
looking
similar
to
a
cola
without
the
fizziness
head
retention
wanted
to
stick
around
but
wasnt
really
able
to
would
have
again
but
wont
go
far
out
of
the
way
for
it
pours
an
amberish
light
brown
with
about
half
of
an
inch
in
rather
thick
foam
head
on
top
the
head
is
a
nice
treat
actually
not
expected
strong
nutty
aromas
permeate
the
nostril
cavities
along
with
a
touch
of
caramel
toffeeness
its
not
a
sockloser
but
no
disappointment
either
mouthfeel
is
average
if
a
bit
thin
without
being
too
watery
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
sweet
buttery
toffee
and
a
slight
background
of
nuttiness
finishing
the
swig
is
enough
hop
character
to
be
noticed
not
really
expecting
more
than
that
for
this
style
all
in
all
seems
to
be
a
well
balanced
brew
for
the
style
falls
short
of
the
brews
from
england
but
is
also
cheaper
than
those
brews
so
theres
a
reason
to
try
it
other
than
a
slightly
above
average
session
brew
here
i
think
i
could
have
stood
for
a
little
more
carbonation
in
there
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
hints
of
hazlenut
fig
and
roasted
malt
no
noticeable
hops
not
overly
complex
but
good
and
smooth
hence
a
drinkable
beer
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
solid
deep
brown
color
with
a
light
head
over
top
that
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
go
away
clarity
is
excellent
with
a
healthy
carbonation
cascading
up
from
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
helping
maintain
that
head
nose
is
caramel
and
brown
sugar
sweet
with
a
underlying
nuttyness
and
melanoidan
toastyness
that
meld
well
together
its
a
good
balance
of
roasttoast
and
sweet
flavor
is
more
dominated
by
the
nutty
charcter
but
with
a
light
brown
sugary
sweetness
there
to
balance
it
finishes
very
nutty
with
a
mild
toasty
melanoidan
character
i
like
how
the
flavor
really
stays
on
into
the
finish
its
very
clean
with
nothing
in
there
to
get
in
the
way
as
i
drink
more
of
it
and
it
warms
up
there
is
an
almost
orange
tinge
to
it
that
i
could
do
without
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
i
could
stand
a
touch
more
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
feeling
too
thick
and
break
things
up
a
bit
its
not
bad
just
what
i
would
do
differently
drinkability
on
this
one
is
good
for
me
id
like
that
orange
character
to
not
be
there
otherwise
this
is
a
nice
brew
i
am
not
the
best
judge
of
a
nut
brown
but
i
would
put
this
one
up
there
with
bells
brewerys
nut
brown
it
has
a
lot
going
on
and
a
fantastic
kick
at
the
end
i
would
encorage
people
to
try
it
im
a
big
fan
and
i
hope
to
have
more
chances
to
tast
it
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
this
spring
i
didnt
buy
it
with
too
many
expectations
but
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
this
is
not
your
average
nut
brown
it
has
more
of
a
herbal
refreshing
taste
to
it
than
a
nutty
carmel
flavor
it
is
great
for
what
it
is
labeled
for
enjoying
on
a
spring
day
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
i
love
a
good
brown
ale
e
g
hex
nut
and
i
really
love
redhooks
esb
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
probably
wont
buy
again
dan
o
k
brown
ale
glad
i
tried
it
but
doubt
i
will
have
it
again
after
i
finish
this
6
pack
d
very
easy
drink
i
can
drink
alot
of
these
i
would
not
buy
this
again
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
overall
i
dont
know
about
this
one
im
a
fan
of
their
esb
and
it
tastes
they
use
the
same
hops
but
i
just
think
this
one
falls
short
of
the
style
not
bad
though
and
i
will
enjoy
my
other
five
but
dont
think
i
will
get
this
one
again
perhaps
next
year
this
was
a
fairly
good
beer
it
was
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
tiny
bit
of
red
it
had
a
thick
coffeecolored
head
with
good
lacing
it
had
a
nutty
sweet
smell
the
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
it
was
mostly
just
sweet
with
a
minimal
amount
of
hops
i
couldnt
discern
the
coffeechocolate
flavor
that
the
banner
claimed
was
there
still
an
ok
beer
never
one
of
my
most
favorite
beers
but
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
pours
a
threefingered
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
trace
of
lace
nice
clear
deep
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
nutty
nose
starts
on
the
sweet
side
with
hops
in
background
and
finishes
fairly
smooth
1
25
for
a
12
oz
bottle
from
capital
convenience
cocord
nh
the
beer
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
toastey
nut
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
bisquit
and
victory
malts
its
dry
with
a
slight
malty
sweetness
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
light
yet
malty
flavor
that
is
smooth
on
the
way
down
and
dry
on
the
finish
it
has
a
light
crystal
malt
sweetness
and
a
nutty
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
prefer
a
maltier
beer
with
less
carbonation
but
this
has
good
flavor
and
aroma
as
well
as
being
quite
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
easy
but
is
played
out
nicely
by
excellent
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
i
think
this
one
is
groing
on
me
the
more
i
drink
of
it
definitly
worth
a
try
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
has
ok
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
toasted
malts
and
some
nuttiness
along
with
a
good
bit
of
hops
smells
ok
the
flavor
is
a
little
disappointing
as
it
seems
dulled
down
some
toasted
flavors
and
a
little
but
of
nuttiness
but
its
just
not
very
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
the
drinkaibility
is
good
just
needs
some
more
flavor
drinkability
body
is
light
and
the
hoppy
crispness
makes
it
pretty
quaffable
the
only
thing
is
its
rather
boring
and
i
probably
wouldnt
bother
to
have
more
than
1
or
2
unless
somebody
brought
a
box
of
this
to
a
picnic
and
nothing
else
aroma
is
sweet
and
cola
tinged
and
even
that
is
very
low
intensity
dark
brown
body
with
reddish
tinting
holds
a
wispy
pinky
sized
head
fruity
malt
sweetness
in
the
fore
tastes
very
much
like
licking
the
frosting
off
a
cheap
711
pastry
im
not
getting
the
nutty
flavors
that
are
supposed
to
be
here
just
a
sweet
malty
mildly
yam
tasting
melange
i
really
want
to
like
redhook
and
i
always
buy
their
stupid
seasonals
but
they
just
always
seem
to
mail
it
in
with
their
beers
d
the
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
pedestrian
brown
ale
not
bad
not
great
the
mouth
feel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
and
has
just
enough
carbonation
pours
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
kakhi
head
with
decent
head
retention
pretty
good
lacing
i
might
add
taste
is
sourish
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
sorta
sticky
drinkability
is
quite
good
just
as
long
as
you
like
the
taste
i
liked
their
esb
better
but
this
is
not
impressive
to
me
i
would
say
i
like
turbodog
or
even
petes
wicked
as
far
as
english
brown
ales
go
it
is
more
intense
than
turbodog
by
far
overalll
this
is
a
pretty
damned
decent
beer
a
little
too
cloying
for
me
to
drink
all
night
long
but
its
good
id
drink
more
than
a
couple
poured
a
very
deep
mahagony
color
with
slightly
offwhite
puffy
head
that
feel
to
a
thin
ring
left
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
and
was
easily
revived
with
gentle
swirling
smell
is
very
mild
with
only
a
light
maltiness
present
taste
is
pleasant
enough
with
a
light
roasted
maltiness
and
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
background
finish
is
also
very
mild
with
a
light
maltiness
and
light
dryness
to
be
found
a
very
middleofthe
road
beer
that
is
not
offensive
but
not
very
exciting
this
beer
pours
a
nice
transparent
reddishbrown
color
with
a
light
offwhite
twofinger
head
that
drops
quickly
to
a
very
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
fruity
almost
like
stale
nut
and
malt
hrrm
no
its
not
expired
flavor
is
a
bit
creamy
and
nutty
with
an
aftertaste
that
lingers
and
reminds
me
of
a
macrobrew
attempt
at
a
nut
brown
not
terribly
pleasing
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
borderline
watery
its
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
that
id
want
to
drink
much
of
this
i
have
three
bottles
that
i
need
to
pass
off
on
friends
not
remarkable
however
its
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
i
actually
picked
this
up
on
a
really
spring
feeling
day
and
it
actually
fit
in
pretty
well
pours
a
very
clear
dark
mahogany
with
orangeruby
highlights
one
finger
head
semidensenot
much
retention
and
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
a
nice
blend
of
english
hops
caramel
and
a
nutty
aroma
packed
with
crystal
malt
flavor
and
a
mild
nut
taste
in
the
back
the
aftertaste
shows
both
herbal
english
hop
flavor
and
dry
american
citrus
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
smooth
and
even
carbonation
clean
finish
and
a
good
balance
of
sweet
malt
to
fresh
hops
makes
this
a
great
session
ale
body
is
lacking
and
feels
barely
above
light
with
a
forced
carbonation
mouthfeel
and
smooth
crisp
texture
a
nobrainer
and
easy
to
drink
red
hook
has
succeeded
in
creating
an
american
version
of
a
british
classic
with
a
beguiling
taste
and
aroma
that
could
be
just
what
you
are
looking
for
when
sweater
weather
comes
around
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
from
the
redhook
folks
but
nothing
to
rave
about
id
drink
it
again
but
its
not
something
to
pick
up
on
a
regular
basis
not
a
bad
american
nut
brown
but
nothing
special
either
rich
brown
amber
color
with
a
nice
tan
lace
for
a
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
roasted
malt
and
a
sweet
nuttiness
the
taste
is
mild
nothing
is
over
done
a
good
blend
of
maltiness
and
grains
has
a
toasted
malt
semidry
aftertaste
meduim
mouthfeel
with
a
little
carbonation
good
drinkablility
and
is
a
great
session
beer
will
i
buy
it
again
sure
a
good
beer
nothing
extra
special
nothing
objectionable
nut
brown
is
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
nicesized
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
rather
weak
and
clean
just
a
touch
of
hops
and
nuttiness
are
noted
taste
is
very
much
of
nutty
malts
with
an
almost
sugary
sweet
finish
mild
hops
are
noted
and
give
the
beer
a
little
more
personality
the
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
that
stands
out
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
this
beer
goes
down
really
easy
however
this
isnt
interesting
enough
to
make
me
come
running
back
for
more
overall
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
of
the
better
from
red
hook
this
is
one
mellow
brew
and
while
this
means
its
easygoing
and
drinkable
it
also
makes
it
somewhat
unremarkable
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
all
things
considered
its
not
that
bad
recommended
but
only
barely
drinkability
easy
to
put
down
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
use
to
introduce
a
mainstream
beer
drinker
to
brown
ales
might
help
them
get
past
the
fear
of
darker
beers
since
this
one
doesnt
taste
very
deep
and
dark
good
but
nothing
special
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
and
has
a
tan
head
that
leaves
a
bunch
of
lace
this
is
a
very
mild
brown
ale
a
favorite
of
mine
because
of
its
outstanding
drinkability
when
it
warms
it
gradually
becomes
more
flavorful
nutty
flavors
abound
this
beer
is
definitely
better
at
cellar
temperatures
it
is
a
great
winter
session
beer
for
the
nights
when
you
want
a
mellow
brown
ale
overall
impression
very
poundable
no
off
tastes
to
slow
down
a
session
but
some
nice
depth
and
subtleties
to
keep
you
interested
i
like
the
hop
presence
that
started
low
but
seemed
to
build
as
i
got
deeper
in
the
glass
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
offering
so
far
from
redhook
id
happily
drink
some
more
poured
out
to
a
beautiful
brownred
color
with
a
lacey
off
white
creamy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
scent
of
sweet
roasted
nuts
was
most
noted
complex
sweet
flavor
of
nuts
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
slightly
sour
after
taste
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
i
would
recommend
to
those
who
like
oatmeal
stouts
and
other
brews
of
this
sort
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
taking
into
mind
that
this
was
brewed
under
a
semimass
produced
guise
im
very
impressed
not
so
bad
if
you
want
a
lighter
interpretation
of
the
style
just
not
very
complex
at
all
nice
looking

you
in

i
think
there
is
a
distant
hop
presence
but
it
doesnt
really
matter
hops
wont
help
here
once
again
i
just

a
hint
of

taste
is
murky
with

and
minute

body
is
way
too

reedhook
nut
brown
pours
a
brown
color
with
a

head
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
flavor
is
by
no
means
overpowering
but
the
nutty
and
malty
taste
are
quite
pleasant
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
gives
it
a
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
definitely
one
of
redhooks
better
offerings
a
decent
brown
ale
with
an
excellent
mouthfeel
not
being
a
fan
of
the
style
in
general
this
was
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
tried
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
the
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
that
left
a
little
lace
here
and
there
the
smell
was
very
nutty
and
good
the
flavor
was
very
nice
with
great
nutty
taste
and
a
sturdy
malt
backbone
the
hops
did
not
shine
through
that
much
but
the
smootheness
of
the
beer
made
up
for
the
lack
of
bitterness
a
good
offering
from
redhook
a
bottle
from
acme
bar
and
pizza
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
moderate
head
the
aroma
was
nutty
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
nutty
it
lacked
the
hop
kiick
that
i
was
looking
for
but
it
was
malty
not
bad
but
not
great
something
i
would
buy
if
i
was
limited
on
choice
i
should
have
gone
with
the
ubu
on
tap
poured
into
a
redhook
nut
brown
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
over
the
smell
is
malty
and
nutty
not
too
much
hops
present
the
aromas
arent
very
strong
the
taste
is
more
on
the
malty
side
just
a
little
nuttiness
coming
through
only
a
small
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
just
an
average
nut
brown
poured
into
a
pint
glass
formed
a
12
light
brown
head
on
top
of
a
clear
brown
hued
brew
aroma
is
malty
with
the
scent
of
hops
evident
as
well
taste
shows
lack
of
body
but
does
illustrate
an
attempt
at
a
malty
flavor
with
little
bitterness
present
this
is
not
as
good
as
the
sample
i
remembered
having
on
tap
last
spring
but
i
have
to
review
what
i
have
in
front
of
me
it
is
easy
drinking
and
smooth
but
seems
to
be
lacking
in
that
brown
ale
heartiness
that
one
might
expect
appearance
ruby
chestnut
brown
tone
with
a
nice
sized
creamy
tan
head

slight

easy
drinking
could
have
a
few
was
glad
to
try
it
but
nothing
will
keep
reeling
me
back
to
this
one
just
a
decent
beer
this
beer
pours
smoothly
and
through
my
pint
glass
looks
almost
as
if
it
were
maple
syrup
it
may
be
psychological
but
it
seems
to
have
a
wonderful
nutty
taste
almost
like
a
snickers
bar
its
not
too
heavy
like
some
darker
ales
it
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
bitter
for
how
dark
of
an
ale
it
is
though
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
brown
ale
is
it
earthshattering
no
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
might
function
as
an
introductory
dark
ale
for
someone
who
equates
dark
with
bitter

no

behind
the
beer
has
a
clear
chestnut
brown
appearance
with
more
than
ample
carbination
too
much
in
my
opinion
for
this
style
has
a
slightly
nutty
toffeeish
malty
aroma
up
front
the
malt
disappears
fast
in
the
middle
and
is
overtaken
by
herbal
hops
the
finish
leaves
some
of
the
nuttyness
behind
i
feel
that
the
body
is
way
too
thin
and
the
hops
and
carbination
are
taking
centerstage
where
the
malt
should
be
it
would
be
something
i
could
drink
if
i
had
a
limited
choice
between
this
and
macros
but
not
something
i
will
go
out
and
pay
for
again
a
mellow

a
very
nice

off
the

this
beer
poured
to

also
very

theres
definitely
nuts
of
a
brown
variety
evident
in
the
taste
it
tastes
a

rich

the
flavor
is
decent
it
seemed

the

is

taste
is
not
even
in
the
same
ballpark
as
the
other
great
brown
ales
out
there
tasted
a

just
not

the

the
strong

some

taste

mild
with
a
good
sense

with

this

will
be
a

drinkability

this
is
really
so
far
the
only
redhook
offering
that
ive
liked
it
is
flavorful
easy
on
the
mouth
deadon
for
the
style
and
with
the
low
abv
makes
a
great
session
ale
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
session
beer
unfortunately
when
i
went
back
for
more
i
was
told
it
was
no
longer
being
produced
at
least
i
got
to
have
one
dark
brown
color
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
nutty
a
lighter
bodied
brown
ale
malts
are
slightly
roasted
nutty
and
somewhat
sweet
hops
are
mild
slightly
bitter
and
a
touch
citrusy
taste
is
a
little
thin
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
really
very
interesting
thats
not
meant
to
be
a
rip
its
a
nice
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
have
any
distinguishing
character
to
it
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
a
pretty
nice
beer
if
a
little
dull
a
good
party
beer
something
to
drink
when
you
want
flavor
but
are
more
concerned
with
being
social
rather
than
paying
attention
to
your
beer
okay
i
stayed
away
from
this
one
as
long
as
time
permitted
because
i
was
reluctant
to
respond
to
the
numerous
and
mostly
positive
reviews
i
heard
regarding
this
particular
red
hook
brew
too
sweet
for
a
nut
brown
maybe
thats
just
me
but
samuel
smith
n
b
more
accurately
summarizes
what
im
looking
for
in
a
nut
brown
ale
nose
is
sweet
caramel
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
sweet
and
syrupy
i
hate
to
reduce
myself
to
making
such
statements
but
this
is
a
chick
beer
at
best
i
might
have
enjoyed
this
a
little
more
if
it
was
the
first
beer
of
the
evening
a
tasty
little
brown
ale
perfect
session
beer
a
dark
red
brown
color
gave
off
to
an
ok
white
head
the
head
fades
fast
with
very
little
lace
a
malty
slightly
nutty
aroma
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
butterscotch
in
there
a
slightly
nutty
taste
with
an
all
malt
finish
i
thought
the
taste
was
a
bit
week
over
all
a
close
to
average
brew
served
a
translucent
reddishbrown
longlasting
excellent
retention
beige
head
loads
of

eyecandy
in
a
glass
clean
malty

sort
of

malty

clean

faint
bitterness
and
kind
of
dry
with
only
minor
lingering
sweetness
mediumlight
body
thin
creamy
mouthfeel
aboveaverage
but
nothing
id
seek
out
drinkable
id
have
it
again
in
a
pinch
the
beer
is
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
nice
head
but
it
pops
away
quickly
to
almost
nothing
seems
to
be
very
carbonated
smells
woodsy
and
a
little
like
chocolate
taste
not
enough
umph
but
malty
and
smooth
weighty
but
not
thick
keeps
the
palate
clean
nearly
perfect
weight
and
aftertaste
very
appealing
and
highly
drinkable
poured
a
beautiful
dark
brown
to
an
almost
dark
red
in
color
maintained
a
half
inch
thick
solid
white
head
i
was
very
surprised
at
the
appearance
for
being
a
redhook
beer
showed
a
good
amount
of
lacing
while
still
retaining
some
head
the
aroma
had
a
breadyearthyand
very
malty
smell
leaves
a
long
bitter
after
taste
fullbodied
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
nothing
watery
about
this
oneits
plenty
thick
the
overall
taste
isnt
too
appealing
to
me
it
has
a
strange
finish
that
i
cannot
make
out
as
far
as
taste
the
appearance
really
impressed
me
though
the
only
time
i
drink
anything
from
redhook
is
either
at
a
hockeybaseballor
football
game
edit
i
had
to
reduce
my
rating
a
bit
on
4905
this
brew
is
a
bit
thinner
than
the
last
time
i
rated
it

after

still
its
one
of

brews

a

this

a

theres

happened
by
accident
as
i
was
cleaning
my
kitchen
first
off
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
smelled
this
bad
while
tasting
so
good
it
had
a
caramel
scent
with
very
heavy
undertones
of
wet
dog
at
this
point
i
was
sure
id
hate
it
even
though
it
looked
pretty
appetizing
nice
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
healthy
head
anyhoo
bottoms
up
surprisingly
the
brew
tasted
pretty
good
chocolate
and
hazelnut
flavors
combine
to
form
a
smooth
tasty
beer
maybe
i
should
actually
drink
this
from
the
bottle
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
light
tan
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
pretty
well
smell
is
caramely
with
some
roasted
malt
in
the
background
roasted
malt
and
some
light
hops
are
the
first
to
hit
the
tongue
the
hops
are
soon
subdued
by
the
caramel
and
background
nutty
flavor
smooth
across
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
brewery
they
dont
ever
make
anything
that
blows
my
mind
but
all
of
their
beers
are
at
least
great
session
brews
consistent
quality
and
very
widely
available
this
or
another
redhook
brew
are
often
what
i
fall
back
on
when
i
am
at
a
bar
with
poor
choices
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint

glass
clear
mediumbrown
that
poured
a
twofinger

and
held
a
serious
lace
big
time
malt
nose
malt
start
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
an
underlying
roasted
barley
flavor
finishes
with
bitter
hops
wellbalanced
and
toasty
a
touch
of
roasted
barley
mixed
in
with
the
sweet
malts
give
this
beer
its
nutty
taste
a
fine
american
brown
im
honestly
surprised
the
average
review
is
as
low
as
it
is
this
is
a
mighty
tasty
brown
imo
looks
good
in
the
glass
smells
like
well
beer
not
a
terrible
malty
brew
with
hops
barely
peeking
its
head
now
and
again
im
not
real
big
or
real
experienced
with
brown
ales
but
i
like
this
one
as
an
easy
drinking
beverage
i
love
the
toastiness
of
the
malt
not
overly
sweet
either
and
after
binging
on
doppels
the
past
month
this
hits
the
spot
nicely
not
a
powerhouse
of
flavor
but
pretty
tasty
for
a
brown
easy
drinking
with
a
twinge
of
hop
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tounge
seems
very
balanced
and
easy
drinking
i
really
think
this
is
pretty
good
compared
to
the
handfull
of
brown
ales
ive
tried
drinkable
not
harsh
at
all
but
thin
it
is
more
or
less
riding
on
the
lightness
with
a
slight
toasted
malt
flavour
there
are
far
better
brown
ales
out
there
notes
very
drinkable
an
excellent
ale
for
light
beer
drinkers
that
want
a
little
more
ruby
colored
with
a
light
tan
head
smells
of
raisins
molasses
and
burnt
bread
crust
a
bit
of
that
continues
in
the
taste
but
the
addition
of
caramel
is
what
stands
out
as
well
as
some
stale
hop
bitterness
that
i
found
a
little
offputting
surprisingly
light
bodied
compared
to
the
strong
aroma
its
good
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
in
the
body
to
match
the
amazing
aroma
overall
perfect
fall
beer
picked
up
3
bottles
to
compare
to
a
clone
i
tried
to
make
definetely
picking
out
the
chocolate
malt
in
the
flavor
and
black
malt
in
aroma
and
perhaps
the
sugar
additions
gives
it
that
molasses
flavor
a
little
surpised
at
the
light
booziness
pretty
sure
its
there
but
perhaps
just
my
palate
tonight
great
brown
ale
smooth
sweet
at
times
hoppy
balanced
looks
dark
and
seems
like
it
should
be
heavier
but
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
up
there
with
dfh
brown
and
smuttynose
for
me
ill
be
grabbing
this
again
soon
best
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
not
really
into
the
style
but
this
beer
just
plain
ol
rocks
o
i
like
the
comforting
earthy
qualities
of
this
beer
while
i
find
it
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
still
think
i
would
pick
a
sam
smiths
nut
brown
over
this
but
this
will
definitely
slake
my
thirst
of
the
style
overall
i
liked
this
a
little
unsure
of
the
sediment
i
allowed
by
storing
on
its
side
but
its
got
a
very
beautiful
color
to
it
the
color
alone
drew
me
in
the
taste
is
certainly
not
the
typical
brown
taste
and
i
really
like
that
for
a
change
good
beer
but
15
a
pop
here
in
california
is
a
killer
for
me
especially
at
5
9
o
a
very
nice
english
style
brown
ale
however
there
are
cheaper
options
of
quality
in
this
category
woodstock
inns
pigs
ear
remains
my
favorite
english
brown
at
about
half
the
price
of
st
bs
so
despite
enjoying
it
i
would
probably
not
buy
this
again
the
ale
is
an
effortless
ale
to
drink
as
it
is
highly
rewarding
in
flavor
but
crisp
and
semiclean
and
palatable
to
finish
the
22oz
bottle
was
no
match
for
this
thirsty
guy
drink
this
one
fresh
its
not
worth
aging
it
o
explosive
somewhat
complex
english
flavors
i
really
enjoyed
this
whatever
style
it
may
be
easily
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
definitely
the
best
example
of
the
beer
ive
had
o
a
very
nice
english
brown
ale
not
the
most
complex
but
thats
not
what
most
english
or
englishstyle
ales
are
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
quaffable
pretty
things
also
never
disappoints
with
their
price
point
recommended
if
youre
into
the
style
overall
would
buy
again
a
light
clean
malty
odor
floats
up
from
this
nicelyturbid
mediumbrown
ale
saint
botolphs
has
a
rustic
character
indeed
with
sharp
veryslightly
sour
notes
effervescing
above
the
rich
sweetness
of
the
malt
ive
had
darker
browns
but
perhaps
not
truer
the
roasting
is
exquisite
and
not
at
all
overdone
like
some
browns
nor
is
it
overly
rich
or
sweet
or
in
any
other
sense
trying
too
hard
to
hit
the
brown
mark
im
a
fan
of
this
style
and
this
crisp
clean
softly
piquant
offering
is
one
of
the
best
iterations
ive
tried
the
only
downside
is
it
isnt
sold
in
sixpacks
deep
chestnut
brown
very
nice
head
and
lacing
the
mild
and
pleasant
toasty
raisin
smell
leads
nicely
to
the
first
sip
and
becomes
more
noticeable
thereafter
if
malt
can
be
described
as
nectar
this
comes
close
not
so
much
because
it
is
thick
or
too
sweet
but
because
the
sweetness
is
so
well
integrated
with
the
aroma
so
are
the
yeasts
the
herbal
hops
the
roasted
flavors
this
is
a
remarkable
brown
ale
though
it
is
bitter
this
is
a
textbook
example
for
me
at
least
of
how
elegantly
bitter
flavors
can
be
integrated
into
the
overall
picture
amazing
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
even
if
you
arent
enamored
with
the
style
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
in
fact
everyone
at
the
table
enjoyed
it
and
most
people
ordered
a
second
glass
with
lunch
poured
a
hearty
dark
brownish
color
with
minimal
head
but
some
decent
lace
that
stuck
around
picking
up
slight
hops
in
the
aroma
along
with
roasted
and
bready
malts
touches
of
something
like
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
maybe
something
burnt
andor
toffeeish
not
real
specific
i
know
thicker
fullerbodied
than
most
browns
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
just
a
tad
off
for
me
the
sweetness
from
the
beer
seems
to
derive
from
dark
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
yeast
and
is
balanced
with
not
only
a
largerthannormal
earty
hoppiness
but
roasted
toasted
possibly
burnt
malts
and
a
crackerlike
dry
breadiness
that
almost
creates
a
chewey
sensation
unfortunately
as
i
slowly
sipped
the
beer
and
it
warmed
the
taste
i
wont
say
the
abv
bc
it
is
not
even
at
6
seemed
to
go
towards
the
dryer
parts
of
this
beer
and
the
smoothness
dipped
a
little
so
basically
the
beer
became
dry
and
husky
and
the
sweetness
and
the
touch
of
hops
subdued
a
good
beer
but
not
my
personal
favorite
for
this
style
i
highly
recommend
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
red
small
amount
of
head
smell
is
a
fruity
caramel
malt
but
not
overly
sweet
a
fruity
brown
ale
bit
nutty
with
a
bitter
finish
the
bitterness
is
on
the
intense
side
just
a
touch
of
toffee
poured
from
22oz
botle
into
tulip
nice
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
off
white
head
great
toffee
and
sweet
malt
aromas
taste
is
sweet
english
style
malts
toffee
and
a
bit
of
honey
really
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
to
noble
hop
really
nice
this
is
a
really
nice
english
style
brown
ale
for
the
style
there
isnt
much
better
offered
in
the
states
i
highly
recommend
it
o
great
brown
ale
highly
recommended
and
would
have
again
one
of
the
best
browns
ive
encountered
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
caramel
brown
like
a
light
roast
coffee
with
a
light
creamy
head
that
sits
at
a
sticky
half
of
a
fingers
width
and
leaves
a
thin
sticky
wall
of
spatterwork
lacing
the
beers
body
is
dark
but
seems
clean
and
there
are
lots
of
bubbles
coming
up
the
sides
from
carbonation
the
beer
smells
richly
malty
with
a
nice
lactic
souring
to
the
back
of
the
smell
the
nose
is
reminiscent
of
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
or
craizens
cranberry
raisins
there
are
faint
roasty
notes
but
the
lactic
sour
overpowers
them
swiftly
and
is
a
little
offputting
the
beer
tastes
wonderfully
roasty
and
nutty
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
biscuity
malts
the
tastes
begins
with
faint
lactic
sours
and
then
opens
up
into
big
roasted
nut
flavors
before
closing
back
to
roasted
burn
with
hints
of
lactic
sugars
like
in
a
milk
stout
i
am
of
course
aware
that
these
arent
really
lactic
sugars
or
sours
that
i
taste
but
that
is
the
best
i
can
do
to
describe
them
so
bare
with
me
the
sour
gives
hints
towards
slight
pear
raisin
and
apple
flavoring
before
it
is
burnt
away
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
kissing
the
tongue
with
barely
any
hint
of
prickly
carbonation
and
only
a
smooth
blanket
of
chewy
beer
the
tongue
is
left
quite
dry
and
slightly
burnt
as
the
beer
leaves
which
definitely
encourages
more
liquid
to
calm
it
down
there
is
also
a
slight
tea
astringencytightness
to
the
tongue
reminiscent
of
hops
bitters
but
different
and
slightly
earthy
overall
this
is
a
tremendously
odd
ale
that
perfectly
defies
definition
in
true
pretty
things
style
it
is
a
delightful
sipper
weighing
in
just
above
a
session
ale
but
goes
down
nicely
another
great
beer
from
pretty
things
and
worthy
of
a
sip
though
i
liked
collaboration
3
with
boulevard
brewing
more
in
terms
of
similar
beers
overall
45
pretty
things
saint
botolphs
town
is
a
solid
brown
ale
one
that
i
think
is
pretty
unique
in
its
hoppy
dryness
and
rustic
earthy
tones
while
i
favor
dogfish
heads
indian
brown
this
is
also
a
very
good
american
interpretation
of
a
traditional
english
style
perhaps
not
the
best
pretty
things
beer
but
a
good
choice
as
the
seasons
change
and
the
cool
fall
air
settles
in
o
this
was
really
yumy
nothing
over
the
top
just
very
well
balanced
and
all
around
delicious
i
will
deffinatly
be
drinking
this
one
again
and
again
in
fact
the
finish
is
quite
bitter
and
even
becomes
dry
this
drinks
really
like
a
coffeechocolate
liqueur
with
a
hint
of
the
creaminess
of
baileys
as
much
like
a
liqueur
as
a
beer
but
not
as
thick
o
delicious
and
unique
beer
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
entire
bomber
the
differences
between
english
and
american
ales
are
such
a
gift
to
beer
drinkers
i
love
the
contrasts
of
the
styles
on
each
side
of
the
pond
original
review
on
09102010
the
body
is
full
and
smooth
with
soft
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
solid
one
of
the
better
browns
on
the
market
taste
is
much
less
interesting
or
satisfying
than
the
aroma
promised
it
is
spicyraisiny
slightly
burnt
prunes
fermented
brown
bread
spicy
woody
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
vague
toasted
brown
bread
and
some
prune
it
has
too
much
of
a
burntbitter
spicy
quality
that
tends
to
dominate
too
much
and
ends
up
after
initial
promises
of
complexity
being
rather
onedimensional
and
thin
of
character
whilst
at
the
same
time
being
rather
heavy
it
settles
on
very
much
a
simple
but
heavy
burnt
breadprune
character
with
vague
spicy
bitterness
and
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
beer
it
was
very
flavorful
but
also
pretty
easy
drinking
very
good
version
of
the
style
as
well
o
to
be
fair
not
my
favorite
style
but
an
enjoyable
brown
would
not
mind
having
again
poured
a
clear
extremely
deep
amber
with
2
fingers
of
tan
head
smells
of
grapes
plum
chocolate
a
very
nice
roasty
flavor
with
a
delicious
caramelnutfruity
backbone
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
like
autumn
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
feel
nice
amounts
of
lacing
on
the
glass
this
is
a
very
solid
and
enjoyable
dessert
beer
but
for
me
tonight
this
is
my
dinner
a
very
filling
sweet
brown
ale
with
a
very
traditional
feel
to
it
malty
fruity
sweet
and
roasty
this
really
is
a
pretty
thing
found
at
the
wild
horse
in
beverly
massachusetts
this
brown
ale
is
a
dark
brown
with
yellowish
edges
and
a
light
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
brings
malty
coffeeecharcoal
with
some
nice
citrus
hop
nuances
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
grapefruit
blended
with
the
brown
bread
malt
theres
a
nutty
brown
bread
backbone
that
evolves
into
more
coffeee
this
is
a
medium
body
brew
with
an
easy
drinking
and
low
carbonation
feel
flavorful
for
sure
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
in
a
lonf
while
o
nice
example
of
a
brown
ale
not
as
nutty
as
some
its
focused
more
on
the
toastedroasted
malt
character
well
balanced
smooth
and
tasty
starts
nutty
and
chalky
on
the
palate
then
turns
rich
and
fruity
before
finishing
hoppy
and
nutty
again
strong
almost
metallic
minerals
pure
malted
barley
dry
roasted
peanuts
bitter
greens
almost
mustardy
or
radishy
honey
oak
and
tobacco
all
check
in
the
overall
impression
is
toasty
fortified
and
brown
but
also
dry
and
somehow
light
and
it
leaves
a
long
fruity
woody
aftertaste
very
interesting
and
unique
without
being
odd
a
beer
for
all
seasons
and
one
you
can
drink
if
you
cant
decide
between
something
english
something
belgian
or
something
american
easy
flowing
combined
with
improving
quality
with
warmth
makes
this
a
great
choice
for
a
second
or
third
round
however
at
almost
6
abv
one
should
take
their
time
with
this
beer
while
the
yeast
isnt
a
hugely
obvious
or
brash
factor
the
whole
thing
is
such
a
classy
blend
of
complex
rich
malts
and
yeast
that
i
am
almost
totally
charmed
o
overall
i
found
this
beer
pleasant
but
not
really
notable
would
be
hard
pressed
to
buy
again
at
6
a
22oz
bottle
one
of
the
best
nonbal
browns
ive
had
after
the
aroma
was
afraid
this
would
be
a
malt
bomb
but
its
very
well
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
overall
a
good
brown
ale
on
the
hoppy
and
higher
alcohol
side
for
an
english
brown
but
quite
good
for
what
it
is
o
a
really
nice
brown
ale
could
drink
lots
of
this
this
is
a
big
malty
english
brown
ale
with
plenty
of
malt
backing
despite
the
relative
size
of
this
it
is
still
decently
easy
to
drink
with
the
nutty
sharpness
at
the
end
doing
a
great
job
in
counteracting
the
sweetness
quite
nice
for
a
big
english
brown
pretty
good
brown
we
have
here
i
think
it
represents
the
northern
england
style
brown
ale
nicely
because
of
the
lite
cloying
and
toffee
aspect
o
love
this
beer
sweet
smell
big
malty
taste
with
a
fun
funky
bitterness
oi
def
think
this
is
better
than
the
other
sampling
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
i
could
drink
all
night
cheers
nice
save
pretty
things
overall
this
is
a
solid
sessionable
brown
ale
full
of
flavor
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
more
flavorful
brown
ales
i
have
had
in
a
while
o
great
price
points
on
this
one
i
think
i
paid
5
99
for
this
bomber
and
would
have
gladly
paid
a
dollar
or
two
more
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
by
pretty
things
o
4
i
wonder
if
this
really
needs
to
be
fresh
to
be
so
good
this
had
some
pleasant
characters
but
everything
was
muted
mild
and
a
little
flat
this
helped
it
all
integrate
but
also
made
me
shrug
a
little
bit
as
well
so
what
overal
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
big
fan
browns
great
very
rich
flavor
however
i
wish
the
carbonation
was
less
or
slightly
less
bitterness
these
two
things
with
strong
mineral
character
make
a
sharpness
that
take
away
from
flavor
for
me
as
i
let
the
glass
sit
and
release
carb
its
gets
really
good
recieved
in
a
trade
i
think
6
bottle
an
amazing
brew
a
brown
this
big
but
this
tight
almost
never
happens
pours
a
very
deep
amber
with
a
thick
tan
head
which
slowly
recedes
some
lacing
white
chunky
sediment
appears
at
the
bottom
looks
awesome
except
for
this
smell
is
subtle
sweet
caramel
some
cherry
and
not
much
else
perhaps
due
to
its
age
taste
it
good
not
too
forward
subdued
sweet
caramel
malts
slight
nuttiness
not
much
bitterness
to
speak
of
a
cherry
and
raisin
aftertaste
ends
a
little
stale
medium
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
ok
flavors
are
subtle
and
work
well
i
definitely
want
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
odthis
is
one
of
the
better
pretty
things
brews
smooth
complex
and
begs
to
be
imbibed
i
have
pushed
off
trying
this
one
because
i
have
minimal
interest
and
experience
in
the
specific
style
of
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
o
a
nice
offering
from
pretty
things
a
nice
clearly

that
was
clean

iam
a

who

extreme

wowed
me
being
an
english
brown
wich
i
think
has
never

great

a

bitter
enough
to
be

at

poured

botolphs
is
a
dark
dark

with

the
aroma
is
simple
and
clean
with
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
roastiness
a
large
sip
reveals
earthy
roasted
malt
flavors
with
the
warm
alcohol
from
the
aroma
in
flavor
this
time
tastes
like
a
belgian
style
yeast
considering
the
pronounced
phenolic
presence
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
with
a
moderate
carbonation
level
it
finishes
with
lingering
bitter
roasted
malts
overall
a
nice
beer
for
a
cool
evening
the
phenolicwarming
alcohol
presence
hampers
the
drinkability
and
for
me
leaves
this
as
a
once
in
a
while
cool
weather
sipper
to
share
with
a
friend
a
nice
hearty
beer
but
drinkability
leaves
something
to
be
desired
for
me
just
a
lovely
ale
for
a
cool
evening
very
nice
overall
a
superb
example
of
a
brown
ale
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
definitely
recommended
overall
a
good
brown
ale
with
lots
of
character
o
a
very
good
brown
ale
well
balanced
great
flavors
and
very
drinkable
this
brew
is
quite
nice
the
pour
comes
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
light
tan
head
on
it
the
lacing
was
minimal
but
still
not
too
bad
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
bit
on
the
nutty
side
but
also
had
a
subtle
sweetness
on
the
nose
the
taste
had
a
light
hoppy
character
in
there
along
with
some
chocolate
too
really
interesting
tasting
brown
ale
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
had
a
smooth
richness
to
it
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
pretty
things
ive
had
really
worth
checking
out
the
bottle
was
pretty
much
the
same
but
with
a
little
more
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
on
the
malt
end
of
the
spectrum
drink
pretty
good
old
feeling
brown
ale
this
had
a
nice
balance
and
symmetry
to
all
the
flavors
wasnt
a
complete
roast
beer
and
one
sided
had
a
nice
creamy
feel
and
it
was
a
little
chilly
in
so
cal
last
night
so
this
was
a
good
choice
in
my
new
dimpled
mug
o
a
decent
english
brown
but
nothing
that
stands
out
if
you
like
the
style
it
is
worth
trying
otherwise
it
is
average
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
very
nutty
with
some
lovely
malt
and
grain
aromas
a
bit
of
a
roasted
chestnut
aroma
taste
is
initially
very
malty
then
a
shitload
of
nut
flavor
comes
in
hints
of
espresso
linger
throughout
each
sip
as
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
surprisingly
crisp
finish
drinkability
is
fairly
high
overall
if
brown
ales
were
my
thing
im
sure
this
beer
would
get
all
5s
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
even
though
i
cant
see
myself
ever
getting
real
into
them
but
im
gonna
rate
this
one
for
its
style
o
not
a
gigantic
brown
guy
but
this
thing
is
pretty
good
see
what
i
did
right
there
o
nice
drinker
but
nothing
that
stood
out
to
me
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
but
felt
it
was
a
bit
too
dark
and
heavy
more
like
a
porter
and
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
a
brown
ale
should
be
it
was
also
a
bit
pricey
o
i
really
love
this
beer
beers
like
this
are
why
i
revere
brown
ales
as
the
ultimate
session
brews
during
the
fall
overall
what
a
great
take
on
the
english
brown
ale
very
well
balanced
with
some
great
malts
that
shine
through
and
a
great
roast
bitterness
with
some
tartness
thrown
in
for
good
measure
another
pretty
thing
in
the
pretty
things
beer
ale
project
o
overall
a
nice
english
brown
ale
nothing
too
crazy
pretty
much
just
good
across
the
board
not
mind
blowing
o
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
a
hard
style
to
distinguish
yourself
in
but
pretty
things
does
a
memorable
job
its
so
roasty
and
thick
its
a
borderline
porter
and
it
is
complemented
by
a
spicy
sweetness
i
associate
with
belgian
styles
very
enjoyable
dont
hesitate
to
try
it
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
of
a
bummer
considering
the
assumed
cost
to
make
it
compared
to
others
in
their
lineup
but
i
am
glad
i
drank
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
with
a
good
deal
of
complexity
well
worth
a
shot
o
not
bad
i
guess
i
really
need
to
drink
an
english
brown
next
to
an
american
one
so
i
can
experience
the
differences
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
saint
botolphs
town
is
my
favorite
beer
by
pretty
things
and
by
far
its
rich
toasty
and
a
bit
chocolaty
with
some
nice
fig
flavor
to
round
it
out
the
bodys
medium
and
its
creamysmooth
once
its
warmed
a
bit
it
reminds
me
of
an
englishstyle
old
ale
rather
than
just
a
simple
brown
ale
its
got
a
kind
of
brown
malt
character
going
on
and
its
got
a
lot
of
dark
caramel
that
borders
on
being
almost
like
burnt
sugar
its
a
hint
sweetish
but
theres
a
fairly
solid
bitterness
behind
it
and
a
hint
of
dark
malt
acidity
as
well
which
lends
to
the
balance
and
leads
into
a
dry
finish
where
the
leafy
hops
finally
appear
you
can
drink
it
straightforward
or
you
can
relax
and
sip
it
quite
charming
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
sweet
with
a
mildly
dry
finish
overall
nice
but
ive
had
better
browns
id
have
this
again
lots
of
esters
in
the
midpalate
overy
nice
stuff
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
in
the
future
notes
nice
brown
ale
rich
and
with
a
long
sense
now
would
i
have
it
again
sure
is
it
worth
getting
out
of
ones
way
to
reach
for
it
not
so
sure
about
that
but
that
is
me
o
my
first
from
pretty
things
a
really
good
brown
ale
that
made
a
good
first
impression
reminds
me
a
lot
of
alesmith
nautical
nut
brown
overall
this
is
a
pretty
beer
to
be
drinking
and
hits
the
spot
just
wished
it
felt
a
little
better
drinkability
this
beer
is
quite
incredible
balance
across
the
board
deep
dark
fruits
and
a
unique
charred
character
it
reminds
me
of
the
dark
fruity
characters
of
a
belgian
quadruple
a
pretty
bold
brown
ale
and
a
homerun
for
pretty
things
the
complexity
may
be
appealing
but
it
is
a
very
intellectual
pleasure
i
find
no
sensuality
here
this
beer
is
a
surprise
i
bought
it
because
id
tasted
two
of
their
beers
a
while
back
and
had
liked
them
but
i
was
really
just
guessing
on
what
it
would
be
like
memory
of
beer
after
tasting
so
many
being
what
it
is
it
is
an
excellent
fullflavored
beer
something
im
always
looking
for
these
days
having
tired
of
the
massive
overhopping
of
american
craft
beers
this
is
a
beer
with
a
strong
malt
profile
more
aggressive
in
its
flavoring
than
most
of
the
english
ales
it
takes
as
its
progenitors
were
i
drinking
it
in
a
pub
with
lots
of
beers
id
be
ordering
it
over
and
over
again
d
an
outstanding
english
brown
ale
beyond
solid
in
all
facets
i
will
gladly
stock
up
on
more
bottles
of
this
this
really
shouldnt
be
a
surprise
and
pretty
things
continues
to
impress
me
with
each
and
every
offering
o
a
very
nice
english
brown
ale
kept
in
line
with
tradition
by
withholding
the
heavy
hand
of
american
hops
a
bit
jacked
up
still
at
nearly
6
abv
this
brown
ale
has
smoky
sweet
flavors
that
played
nicely
off
the
bbq
brisket
sandwich
and
spicy
horseradish
sauce
i
had
id
definitely
pick
up
a
bottle
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
lightbodied
pricklyfeel
on
the
tongue
a
good
and
wholly
interesting
beer
a
very
flavorful
and
balanced
english
brown
one
of
the
better
versions
ive
had
in
a
while
o
loved
this
beer
from
the
second
i
popped
the
cap
i
have
yet
to
be
discouraged
from
pretty
things
o
nicely
done
beer
that
im
glad
that
i
picked
up
if
im
in
a
mood
for
a
different
type
of
english
brown
ale
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
very
easy
to
drink
perhaps
12
at
a
time
you
can
obviously
smell
and
taste
the
british
influence
on
pretty
things
beer
this
is
probably
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
great
beer
overall
pretty
good
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
decent
hop
addition
light
but
earthy
just
a
touch
of
a
briny
taste
but
a
decent

od
it
wont

you
away
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
very
solid
offering
by
pretty
things
might
have
to
pick
up
a
bomber
overall
an
excellent
brew
one
of
the
most
complex
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
so
much
going
on
that
really
clicks
together
very
nice
o
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
would
probably
be
a
great
dinner
or
social
beer
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
great
flavor
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
my
first
beer
by
pretty
things
and
im
excited
to
try
more
i
would
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
d
very
drinkable
smooth
and
balanced
flavors
and
though
they
are
a
touch
mild
it
is
different
and
interesting
very
nice
nutty
flavors
o
one
of
the
finer
sessionable
brown
ales
there
is
loaded
with
great
earthy
and
nuttysmoky
flavors
while
the
alcohol
is
almost
completely
hidden
this
would
probably
become
a
staple
brown
ale
for
me
if
only
it
was
locally
available
awesome
brown
ale
drank
about
a
bombers
worth
ontap
theres
not
too
much
to
speak
of
as
far
as
looks
go
but
looks
arent
everything
great
malty
smell
with
a
light
spicy
hop
scent
and
dark
fruits
everything
compliments
everything
in
this
beer
theres
a
touch
of
booze
in
here
as
ive
come
to
know
and
like
in
many
brown
ales
english
or
american
i
never
knew
how
many
excellent
brown
ales
there
were
out
there

really
nice
beer
i
love
how
the
beer
has
all
the
makings
and
flavor
of
a
sort
of
englishbelgium
dark
ale
but
its
not
sweet
at
all
and
very
dry
and
balanced
its
super
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
id
be
really
interested
to
try
a
super
fresh
one
just
for
comparisons
sake
thanks
very
much
adam
drinkability
is
good
a
lot
more
dark
fruit
than
you
usually
see
in
a
brown
even
an
english
one
but
i
suppose
they
call
it
a
rustic
dark
ale
i
certainly
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
i
was
offered
good
stuff
thanks
again
for
sharing
doopiejeffomar

and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
particularly
with
a
burger
or
steak
or
some
other
grilled
meat

this

the
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
bit
medium
bodied
but
never
knocks
you
off
balance
there
is
a
nice
even
feel
to
this
beer
it
seems
to
just
go
down
so
well
overall
brown
ales
are
usually
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
of
beer
they
tend
to
be
bland
and
somewhat
boring
this
beer
from
pretty
things
beer
and
ale
project
changes
all
of
that
this
is
a
terrific
beer
with
tons
of
amazing
flavors
and
mouthfeel
im
completely
impressed
with
this
beer
and
will
seek
out
more
asap
i
highly
reccomend
trying
this
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
hmm
just
noticed
some
mold
or
something
under
the
cap
great
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
affect
on
it
though
has
a
bitter
finish
this
is
very
dark
for
a
brown
ale
not
bad
though
not
great
as
there
really
isnt
much
here
roasty
etc
but
all
seem
a
bit
subdued
not
bad
for
a
session
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
beer
and
i
think
is
has
to
do
with
the
hop
choice
something
harsh
and
even
medicinal
makes
for
a
weird
tactile
experience
you
know
this
thing
is
fading
but
endures
it
can
be
experienced
as
blackcurrant
in
the
hops
right
up
until
the
end
when
it
gets
a
little
iffy
yet
it
is
still
only
so
offensive
mediumplus
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
lot
heavier
a
body
than
i
was
expecting
a
bit
creamy
pretty
drinkable
although
i
can
see
myself
getting
bored
after
a
couple
all
in
all
a
really
respectable
beer
especially
in
a
style
i
dont
necessarily
seek
out
as
far
as
english
brown
ales
go
this
one
is
thick
enough
and
loaded
with
enough
flavor
to
remind
one
of
a
good
complex
porter
a
thick
mouthfilling
malty
character
takes
over
at
the
first
sip
while
the
aftertaste
and
subsequent
sips
give
way
to
the
flavor
of
raisins
and
brown
sugar
balanced
by
a
mildlybitter
hop
taste
a
very
nice
sipper
especially
around
the
fall
season

d
it
has
alot
going
on
for
something
that
i
thought
would
be
simpler
so
i
would
not
want
to
sit
and
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
but
if
i
could
drink
one
daily
i
would
more
dnotes
a
full
robust
earthy
brown
ale
from
a
top
shelf
brewery
d
i
really
am
impressed
with
this
one
pretty
things
makes
some
good
stuff
its
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
while
im
not
rushing
to
track
down
another
bottle
im
glad
that
i
had
this
one
ill
drink
this
again
sometime
but
now
ill
search
for
some
other
beer
from
pretty
things
d
very
good
top
notch
brown
ale
pours
dark
brown
thick
looking
with
offwhite
head
malty
and
some
roast
aromas
very
tasty
malt
job
supporting
by
light
roast
yeast
is
there
and
that
taste
builds
up
over
a
few
samples
very
drinkable
made
even
more
so
by
its
sweetness
recommended
d
great
drinkability
complex
enough
but
enjoyable
all
the
way
pours
a
very
pretty
deep
rich
brown
with
red
highlights
its
got
some
haze
to
it
and
really
looks
classic
to
the
style
really
dark
body
yields
a
light
brown
fluffy
2finer
head
that
is
thick
and
rich
really
looks
like
a
dubbel
to
me
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nice
also
with
sweet
malts
toffee
caramel
and
hazelnuts
up
front
a
fruity
ester
takes
over
on
the
back
end
and
lightens
this
beer
up
nicely
the
taste
is
near
perfect
iconic
to
the
style
this
has
the
body
of
a
belgian
dubbel
and
the
flavors
of
a
really
nice
american
brown
ale
rich
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
coffee
and
toasted
almonds
and
hazlenuts
on
the
palate
has
a
real
buttery
finish
that
coats
the
palate
nicely
mouthfeel
is
very
full
bodied
a
real
food
friendly
beer
nice
on
a
cool
night
and
will
definitely
be
making
another
appearance
in
my
fridge
really
love
the
the
alcohol
is
restrained
on
this
one
would
love
to
finish
this
bomber
and
maybe
another
by
myself
highly
drinkable
and
worth
seeking
out
this
was
a
very
smooth
beer
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
could
find
this
in
maine
d
a
decent
brown
ale
would
give
another
shot
d
very
smooth
and
very
favorful
i
was
very
pleased
by
this
beer
and
am
hoping
to
investigate
more
from
pretty
things
the
bottle
describes
the
brew
as
a
rustic
dark
ale
but
their
website
describes
it
as
a
yorkshireinspired
big
malty
brown
ale
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
has
some
toasted
notes
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
medium
body
the
malt
character
dominates
the
taste
with
toasted
sweet
caramel
and
slightly
burnt
flavors
dthis
is
a
tasty
brew
with
great
drinkability
not
a
lot
happening
and
pretty
singular
malts
and
more
roasted
malt
pours
a
deep
rich
brown
with
a
pleasant
creamy
head
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
but
not
cloying
underlying
hops
contribute
to
a
pleasant
bitterness
and
surprisingly
clean
finish
i
would
not
mind
seeing
the
abv
increased
a
touch
to
give
it
a
little
more
bite
which
might
also
tame
the
malt
just
a
touch
more
overall
very
good
its
delicious
and
superbly
drinkable
now
and
perhaps
a
delicate
tweak
or
two
away
form
being
masterful
served
cool
in
a
16oz
pint
glass
hazy
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
very
small
tan
head
smell
was
of
an
english
yeast
strain
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
was
velvety
smooth
toasted
malt
flavor
with
a
ripe
fruit
middle
and
finish
hint
of
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
super
rich
and
smooth
very
low
carbonation
excellent
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
to
have
on
cask
even
though
it
was
slighty
cloudy
with
yeast
da
solid
offering
whose
body
of
work
equals
up
to
one
mighty
fine
drinking
brown
ale
plenty
of
flavour
and
a
pleasant
smoothness
makes
this
one
go
down
easy
quite
a
tasty
beer
with
plenty
of
character
to
offer
the
palate
great
traditional
brew
d
well
rounded
fairly
complex
for
the
abv
and
well
balanced
easily
just
found
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
this
has
rapidly
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
has
a
powerful
but
not
overwhelming
malty
taste
and
a
very
clean
finish
there
is
not
a
lot
of
competition
between
hoppy
and
malty
tastes
so
each
flavor
can
be
savored
separately
an
extremely
fine
and
drinkable
beer
this
is
definitely
a
mashup
english
brown
old
ale
and
it
captures
the
hallmarks
of
either
style
perfectly
stylistic
nonsense
aside
this
is
a
wellenvisioned
recipe
that
is
also
brewed
well
with
a
kind
of
voodoo
magic
that
few
can
fathom
the
flavors
are
intense
and
wellintegrated
everything
about
this
beer
screams
excellence
to
me
d
this
was
a
very
nice
brown
ale
definitely
on
the
english
side
with
all
the
malts
and
very
little
hops
the
low
abv
makes
it
sessionable
and
i
liked
the
chocolate
flavors
as
well
as
the
balance
of
the
beer
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
left
good
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
great
roasted
malt
aromas
with
caramel
and
nutty
accents
there
was
also
slight
faint
toffee
and
hop
notes
the
roasted
malts
dominate
the
flavor
with
a
nice
almond
nutty
accent
and
faint
caramel
toffee
and
slight
hop
character
the
beer
was
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
sweet
nutty
and
slight
hop
bitter
finish
this
beer
style
reminds
me
of
high
school
cause
i
use
to
drink
lots
of
english
brown
ales
it
still
drank
pretty
good
and
took
me
back
to
the
good
old
days
the
beer
did
justice
for
the
style
drinkability
was
quite
good
this
is
a
tasty
well
balanced
brown
ale
with
a
rather
intriguing
flavor
profile
it
would
likely
pair
well
with
most
any
pub
fare
d
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
before
knowing
the
style
i
thought
it
could
have
passed
for
an
english
mild
and
could
easily
drink
this
like
it
was
bartender
was
very
enthusiatic
about
this
so
i
hated
to
let
him
down
when
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
so
fantastic
poured
with
a
thick
foamy
frothy
tan
head
and
plenty
of
lace
color
was
an
opaque
brown
black
aroma
was
very
malty
a
bit
roasty
and
a
bit
of
sour
flavor
was
the
same
tartness
seemed
inappropriate
unless
it
woulda
been
a
flemmish
brown
body
was
good
and
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
i
was
noticing
the
tart
more
not
a
session
drinkabilityits
a
bit
too
dark
and
bitter
and
its
flavors
a
tad
too
strong
to
be
considered
very
drinkable
especially
when
compared
to
others
of
its
style
it
drinks
slower
than
average
at
least
for
me
anyway
d
fairly
low
abv
plus
a
pleasant
mild
taste
makes
it
very
drinkable
given
the
opportunity
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
on
cask
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
looks
fantastic
but
a
little
light
on
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
mild
and
well
rounded
my
only
real
complaint
is
the
lingering
dryness
m
d
very
good
full
mouthfeel
a
little
tingly
finishes
a
bit
tannic
tasty
and
drinkable
good
beer
excellent
this
is
pretty
complex
for
an
english
brown
it
brings
a
ton
to
the
table
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
i
will
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
again
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
reddish
tint
head
was
a
light
caramel
color
that
clung
extremely
well
but
didnt
last
long
at
all
aroma
was
of
molasses
and
burnt
sugar
with
small
amouts
of
acidic
bitterness
taste
was
slightly
sweet
rich
vanilla
flavor
reminded
me
a
burnt
rye
or
other
strong
grain
mellowed
out
very
nicely
coated
well
a
bit
thin
and
perhaps
slightly
overcarbonated
but
not
bad
a
very
drinkable
beer
needs
a
few
minutes
to
mellow
out
and
breathe
before
drinking
d
bigger
bolder
flavors
then
im
used
to
with
brown
ale
complex
but
very
drinkable
strength
of
flavors
makes
it
a
slower
drink
for
me
db
great
price
for
22oz
awesome
brown
ale
flavors
i
really
like
the
blend
of
the
flavors
the
only
flaw
is
the
semiweak
aroma
not
a
session
beer
strong
flavors
but
a
good
one
worth
trying
again
on
tap
drinkability
a
really
surprising
ale
that
covers
a
range
of
styles
and
is
just
gosh
darn
good
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
botoplphs
pours
a
dark
brown
that
turns
ruby
at
the
edges
when
held
up
to
light
theres
a
large
toffee
head
that
leaves
behind
a
good
amount
of
lace
the
smell
is
off
bready
malts
and
a
hint
of
yeast
spiciness
thats
very
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
beer
this
is
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
with
some
malty
sweetness
and
the
aforementioned
spiciness
that
show
up
in
the
nose
as
well
as
some
earthy
hop
flavors
lurking
in
the
background
its
like
a
well
done
blend
of
a
brown
ale
and
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
the
carbonation
is
nice
stopping
appropriately
short
of
being
prickly
but
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
i
find
myself
wishing
it
was
a
little
creamier
all
in
all
though
a
quality
beer
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
pretty
things
thats
disappearing
remarkably
quickly
from
my
glass
d
very
enjoyable
i
love
a
nice
6
ale
that
delivers
flavor
this
is
up
there
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
despite
the
poor
attenuation
works
quite
well
in
a
balance
manner
there
is
an
ample
fruitiness
here
a
product
of
hop
malt
and
yeast
a
rich
rustic
malt
character
and
a
supporting
though
substantial
hop
character
as
well
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
one
that
i
find
quite
easy
to
finish
off
a
22oz
of
while
preparing
dinner
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
and
would
not
recommend
to
try
by
the
way
i
do
like
brown
ales
and
have
nothing
against
them
i
just
thought
this
was
not
a
good
representation
of
how
good
this
style
of
beer
can
taste
like
overall
a
somewhat
enjoyable
beer
but
not
great
drinkable
at
least
d
nice
and
sessionable
this
ale
gave
me
an
old
school
feeling
its
been
awhile
since
i
really
explored
english
brown
ale
offhand
i
remember
liking
sam
smith
and
smuttynose
i
know
that
i
didnt
find
any
i
liked
as
much
as
this
one
drinking
it
actually
reminded
me
of
the
first
time
i
tried
ayinger
celebrator
i
recognized
some
of
the
flavors
and
thought
this
is
emphatically
not
up
my
alley
but
i
love
this
beer
an
eyeopener
to
how
certain
flavors
can
work
very
well
done
pretty
things
has
impressed
me
so
far
but
this
beer
is
merely
average
not
sure
why
its
so
highly
rated
maybe
it
needs
to
be
fresher
started
off
as
another
regular
brown
ale
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
developed
into
a
complex
beer
with
all
sorts
of
interesting
yeasty
notes
and
different
tastes
of
caramel
and
nuts
like
most
pretty
things
beers
nothing
is
by
the
book
and
this
is
a
most
unique
brown
ale
serving
type
ontap
extremely
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
got
through
a
bomber
without
a
moments
hesitation
chocolate
malt
and
suggestions
of
cherry
and
other
red
fruits
a
lot
of
balance
and
pleasant
flavors
cant
really
pick
up
anything
harsh
or
unsatisfactory
definitely
has
a
chocolate
milk
lingering
in
the
back
of
the
throat
very
pleased
with
this
brew
like
every
other
pretty
things
brew
d
one
of
the
better
english
brown
ales
ive
tasted
at
5
9
abv
this
brew
is
dangerously
quaffable
plus
it
is
interesting
enough
to
warrant
a
second
and
third
pint
taste
starts
out
malty
but
then
the
hops
take
over
and
you
are
left
with
a
very
dry
roasted
coffee
end
little
to
no
carbonation
medium
thick
mouthfeel
with
some
malt
and
hops
lingering
in
your
mouth
another
really
great
beer
by
pretty
things
from
a
22
ouncer
that
was
bottled
dec
2009
and
comes
from
batch
four
sampled
on
march
16
2010
the
pour
is
a
handsome
mahogany
with
ruby
and
pine
hues
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
light
puffy
head
is
about
three
inches
thick
and
it
eventually
simmers
down
nice
clarity
though
right
after
i
removed
the
cap
i
got
this
instant
burst
of
fruitiness
on
the
nose
then
when
i
began
to
pour
it
the
aroma
segued
into
a
toasted
bready
creamy
yeasty
and
neutral
hopped
balance
i
was
sold
before
i
even
tasted
it
fortunately
the
taste
was
just
as
endearing
with
a
bold
body
and
a
sharp
bitterness
nutlike
quality
concluding
with
a
pleasant
dry
hop
finale
this
beer
really
hit
all
the
pressure
points
in
a
good
way
and
is
highly
recommended
d
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
i
split
the
22
oz
bottle
three
ways
but
wish
i
had
not
it
was
just
right
for
this
60
degree
afternoon
with
spring
right
on
the
horizon
a
very
solid
brown
ale
bordering
on
being
a
brown
porter
nice
layers
of
flavors
throughout
rich
creaminess
works
wonderfully
with
everything
most
brown
ales
i
find
are
one
noted
and
fairly
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
not
one
of
those
beers
another
solid
effort
from
pretty
things
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sugary
semi
sweet
flowery
and
slick
in
the
finish
mellow
yet
with
unexpected
depth
this
is
a
pleasant
example
of
the
style
looks
nice
light
brown
cap
of
fine
bubbles
capping
a
chestnut
brown
beer
malty
aroma
roasty
and
nutty
dry
cocoa
light
notes
of
dried
fruit
and
spice
moderate
bitterness
throughout
really
giving
some
balance
to
the
brown
sugar
and
milk
chocolate
sweetness
up
front
more
of
a
caramel
and
bittersweet
chocolate
flavour
towards
the
finish
with
a
fair
bit
of
clove
spiciness
hidden
behind
the
malts
less
roast
and
fruit
in
the
flavour
but
theyre
there
smooth
texture
carbonation
was
a
little
rough
to
start
but
mellowed
as
the
beer
warmed
medium
to
full
bodied
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
is
quite
nice
flavor
keeps
you
coming
back
and
only
the
lingering
bitterness
strings
it
out
some
tasty
either
way
very
dark
deep
brown
with
a
retentive
pillowy
tan
head
aroma
is
very
nice
for
a
brown
dark
fruits
roasted
malt
mild
hops
some
clove
spiciness
all
nicely
balanced
rich
full
body
for
a
brown
malty
dark
fruit
hops
in
the
finish
and
some
surprising
chocolatecoffee
roast
flavors
mix
in
too
another
interesting
slightly
different
take
on
a
familiar
style
from
pretty
things
i
still
havent
found
one
im
crazy
about
but
ill
keep
on
trying
any
new
ones
i
come
across
pours
a
nice
chestnut
brown
color
off
white
head
leaving
decent
lacing
smell
is
of
roasted
grain
and
nuts
with
a
presence
of
dark
dried
fruit
plum
and
raisin
carmel
and
a
lsight
herbal
quality
taste
is
an
exception
blend
of
roasted
grain
roasted
nuts
crust
bread
and
dried
dark
fruit
a
nice
carmely
sweet
backbone
does
not
approach
bitter
as
many
in
the
style
do
nice
medium
body
with
perfect
carbonation
for
the
style
a
great
finely
crafted
english
brown
with
lots
of
flavor
and
charachter
pours
a
milk
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
big
pillowy
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
of
a
musty
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
brown
sugar
adds
some
sweetness
to
the
aroma
which
is
followed
by
a
lemony
citrus
twang
the
first
sip
is
lightly
roasty
and
woody
almost
like
a
schwarzbier
this
is
followed
by
a
sweet
brown
sugar
flavor
and
a
dry
bitter
hop
in
the
end
the
malt
comes
back
out
reminding
you
that
this
is
indeed
an
english
brown
ale
it
has
that
drylemony
malt
that
i
find
in
a
lot
of
english
ales
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
tingly
to
soft
carbonation
finishes
slightly
dry
and
bitter
a
good
english
brown
ale
nice
flavor
profile
not
the
best
one
that
i
have
tried
but
still
quite
good
yet
another
great
beer
from
the
pretty
things
pours
kind
of
murky
cloudy
and
very
thick
bodied
initial
smell
is
of
roasted
nuts
caramel
and
some
maltiness
or
coffee
taste
is
definitely
roasted
but
not
overdone
the
coffee
flavor
comes
out
and
an
aftertaste
of
something
like
sambuca
or
black
licorice
with
hints
of
earthiness
adds
to
its
complexity
as
it
goes
down
and
warms
can
definitely
taste
the
yeast
combo
used
which
adds
to
the
flavor
rather
creamy
and
smooth
as
befits
its
abv
coffee
and
toffee
up
front
cereal
toast
and
carob
very
roasty
almost
burnt
in
a
subtle
and
pleasant
way
hints
of
leafy
hops
and
minerals
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
for
the
style
which
makes
the
body
seem
a
tad
thin
the
yeast
profile
is
unusually
prominent
giving
the
beer
a
fruity
undertone
finishes
lightly
hoppy
and
roasty
with
a
big
coffee
kick
and
a
faint
mineral
aftertaste
its
a
tasty
beer
no
doubt
and
i
would
say
is
a
more
complex
version
of
dogfish
head
iba
very
good
beer
st
botolphs
town
is
a
good
beer
and
interesting
at
that
clearly
a
unique
brown
ale
and
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
well
worth
your
time
saint
botolphs
town
may
not
be
the
best
english
brown
ale
to
have
entered
my
glass
on
second
thought
it
might
be
its
definitely
the
most
interesting
this
is
a
brewery
to
keep
an
eye
on
make
that
two
eyes
and
a
nose
and
a
tongue
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
nice
thickcreamy
twofinger
light

with
some
awesome

behind
the
nose

malty
nice
little
touch
of

light

the
taste
is
awesome
sweet
malty
with
a
nice
touch

toffeecaramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
brew
really
surprised
me
an
awesome
eba
thanks
john
it
is
a
great
drinking
brew
easy
to
finish
and
i
was
left
wanting
for
more
drinkability
i
had
tried
this
first
on
tap
at
a
local
homebrew
shop
and
liked
it
after
picking
up
a
bottle
rather
dissapointed
i
didnt
get
a
second
at
the
same
time
every
beer
from
pretty
things
is
a
good
one
so
far
they
manage
to
be
subtle
and
versatile
in
way
that
few
other
american
breweries
can
manage
definitely
worth
your
attention
overall
a
decent
beer
a
bit
sweet
but
tasty
overall
im
impressed
with
this
ale
definitely
looking
forward
to
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
next
time
i
head
to
whole
foods
for
lunch
overall
really
a
superb
superb
offering
here
not
really
sure
how
to
classify
it
totally
but
superb
simply
this
is
a
crazy
messy
but
complex
brown
ale
d
suprisingly
refreshing
has
a
balanced
flavor
of
sweet
and
light
bitterness
but
at
the
same
time
is
clean
tasting
and
goes
down
really
easy
md
light
to
medium
bodied
very
lively
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
nothing
spectacular
in
the
taste
but
a
very
solid
beer
balance
is
seen
across
the
board
here
event
the
level
of
charred
grain
is
perfect
not
massive
or
in
your
face
yet
this
is
of
demiepic
material
love
it
cheers
overall
what
a
great
beer
bomber
is
the
perfect
size
as
you
are
glad
there
is
more
to
come
after
the
pint
is
drained
will
be
trying
more
from
these
folks
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
sure
ive
ever
had
one
that
was
so
all
over
the
board
a
bit
tough
to
drink
for
the
style
but
heavenly
on
the
nose
very
odd
but
leaves
me
happy
d
what
an
excellent
brown
ale
it
truly
was
hard
for
me
to
put
this
beer
down
once
i
started
drinking
it
excellent
balance
between
dry
bitter
spicy
fruity
and
whatever
else
you
choose
to
draw
out
of
this
one
im
officially
hooked
on
pretty
things
beer
md
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
shifting
complex
flavor
a
very
nice
beer
this
ptbap
is
brewing
some
impressive
beers
cant
wait
for
them
to
expand
into
their
own
place
so
they
can
experiment
not
typically
a
style
i
go
after
but
im
glad
to
have
sampled
this
offering
from
pretty
things
as
far
as
an
english
brown
ale
goes
it
does
well
not
sure
id
actively
search
this
one
out
but
i
did
enjoy
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
a
good
brown
ale
seems
to
be
more
of
a
stand
alone
ale
or
desert
beer
to
me
i
cant
imagine
what
i
would
pair
this
with
pretty
things
is
an
understatement
this
beer
is
gorgeous
bomber
from
batch
2
april
09
pours
dark
slightly
cloudy
mahogany
with
a
huge
creamy
head
great
lacing
dark
roasted
malt
on
the
nose
with
chocolate
light
molasses
tastes
more
impressive
than
it
smells
toasty
malt
and
chocolate
again
a
slight
bit
of
dark
fruit
very
dry
finish
with
slight
astringency
fairly
full
body
very
nice
brown
ale
over
all
my
least
favorite
of
their
beers
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
brown
ales
are
not
one
of
my
favorites
if
you
like
the
style
you
are
going
to
really
like
this
one
a
beer
for
boston
ya
gotta
love
that
i
also
love
the
fact
that
pretty
things
beers
can
change
drastically
between
batches
so
that
it
is
almost
like
you
are
drinking
a
new
beer
with
every
release
this
is
batch
3
brewed
last
month
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
not
close
to
black
but
as
dark
as
brown
gets
big
and
creamy
tanned
heading
with
some
staying
potential
in
the
appearance
in
the
nose
one
gets
some
caramel
cocoa
powder
freshly
baked
bread
and
many
other
interesting
complexities
sweet
brown
bread
with
powdered
sugar
comes
to
mind
first
in
the
aroma
followed
by
christmas
pudding
and
all
sorts
of
spiced
cookies
overall
much
sweeter
than
previous
batches
about
medium
to
heavy
and
it
feels
much
larger
than
it
is
alcohol
is
virtually
untraceable
which
is
a
little
disappointing
for
me
only
because
that
was
one
of
the
qualities
i
really
liked
in
the
older
versions
overall
this
is
a
bad
ass
brown
that
is
on
the
threshold
of
the
porter
style
it
has
lost
some
of
the
rustic
qualities
from
other
batches
but
this
is
still
really
well
crafted
and
a
brew
that
they
should
serve
at
all
boston
pubs
not
just
for
the
nod
to
boston
but
for
the
overall
quality
cheers
botolph
has
a
dark
brown
body
that
does
not
quite
make
it
to
black
a
small
dark
tan
head
stuck
around
for
a
few
minutes
before
capping
leaving
some
sticky
lace
the
smell
consists
of
dark
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
and
some
old
coffee
the
taste
is
huge
on
the
malts
with
alot
of
nuttiness
some
coffee
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
to
round
it
out
the
feel
could
of
been
a
tad
fuller
as
i
found
this
to
be
a
bit
lightwatery
the
carb
was
not
so
high
also
i
enjoyed
my
glass
and
drank
it
in
no
time
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
nutty
brown
ales
so
this
will
do
for
me
im
thinking
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
rainy
cold
new
england
fall
afternoon
now
we
just
need
them
to
brew

quite
artisanal

from

project
d
very
easy
drinking
and
the
bomber
went
down
way
to
fast
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
there
is
also
nothing
memorable

somewhat
flat
woody
campfire

compliments
a
black

bitter

brown

this

alright
the

cost
it
points
in
drinkability
flavor
d
great
representation
of
the
english
brown

style
they
really
nailed
it
with
a
great
nutty
taste
poured
into
an
imperial

with

ohso
easy
let
it
warm
a
touch
out
of
the

and
youve
pretty
much
got
a
casklike
experience
yay
the

features
the
same
top
quality
all
other
aspects
of
the
beer
carries
pretty
things
crafted
this
brown
ale
nicely
and
ensured
that
the
mouthfeel
fell
somewhere
a
little
bit
more
robust
than
most
brown
ales
but
not
as
heavy
as
say
a
smoked
porter
or
a
stout
there
is
a
really
whole
beer
mouthfeel
to
this
ale
in
the
sense
that
what
you
can
tell
just
by
the
mouthfeel
alone
is
that
the
entire
bottle
and
all
that
has
gone
into
making
this
ale
is
nothing
short
of
brilliant
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
that
support
he
tan
head
beautifully
the
aroma
is
caramely
malt
all
the
way
im
wondering
if
the
color
and
aroma
was
from
the
grain
or
carmalization
in
an
extended
boil
very
tasty
either
way
the
sweet
tasty
malt
flavor
works
well
with
the
roasted
malt
astringency
the
medium
body
and
good
co2
make
this
a
really
drinkable
brown
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
nutty
feel
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
nice
dry
roasted
feel
with
a
light
crystal
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
brown
but
nothing
too
special
the
taste
is
quite
good
and
surprisingly
mild
given
the
nose
on
the
beer
the
beer
is
sweet
a
touch
cloying
so
there
are
definite
molasses
notes
caramel
notes
some
brown
sugars
some
dark
chocolate
notes
some
raisin
flavors
some
spices
maybe
a
touch
in
the
coriander
family
this
is
a
substantial
brown
ale
very
nice
not
too
carbonated
medium
bodied
reasonably
complex
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
d
a
very
wellcrafted
brown
ale
nice
balance
with
no
one
element
coming
to
the
fore
and
overshadowing
the
others
i
would
love
this
brew
with
bbq
beef
brisket
or
spicy
pulled
lamb
with
this
brew
would
make
you
very
happy
d
very
drinkable
ive
tried
the
entire
line
since
the
acbf
they
are
a
solid
brewery
reviewed
on
06042009
bottle
at
pprbsg09
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
it
has
an
aroma
of
indistinct
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
of
super
sweet
caramel
malt
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
bland
overall
and
much
too
sweet
for
me
like
many
poorly
made
brown
ales
the
feel
is
smooth
at
first
then
dry
earthy
and
ashy
on
the
back
end
its
a
decent
dark
ale
sugary
sweet
and
grainily
dark
i
find
the
brew
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
ease
to
drink
full
smooth
flavor
ease
on
the
palate
its
a
rustic
dark
session
ale
it
borders
on
so
many
styles
without
deciding
to
choose
any
one
style
not
my
favorite
of
danns
new
beers
but
a
killer
session
beer
for
sure
picked
up
a
bottle
from
abes
cold
beer
after
enjoying
their
saison
this
beer
unfortunately
is
less
impressive
i
suppose
its
a
little
rustic
in
the
sense
that
the
malts
have
an
earthy
dry
bitter
taste
thats
certainly
not
unpleasant
still
this
beer
just
seems
to
linger
between
and
brown
ale
and
a
porter
for
the
dry
roasted
malt
that
consumes
the
aftertaste
the
aroma
has
more
of
a
candy
dark
chocolate
character
but
the
flavor
and
feel
is
very
dry
i
guess
that
aspect
is
more
belgian
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
im
just
not
sure
whats
going
on
an
excellent
beer
i
came
back
to
this
after
a
few
months
and
found
it
to
hold
up
to
my
lofty
expectations
and
hazy
memory
well
worth
seeking
out
this
is
an
brown
ale
with
some
balls
i
am
not
talking
extreme
just
a
bigger
beer
with
loads
of
flavor
yet
still
remains
easy
to
drink
a
pleasure

the

a

some
more

as
it

i
noticed
something

in
there
as
well
maybe
some

goes
quite
well
with
dinner
tonight
sirloin
tips
on
the
heavier
side

while
lacking
the
density
of
a
porter

nice
and
drinkable

had
a
bit
of
funkiness
at
first
i
hope
pretty

becomes
a
new
england
staple
dann
deserves
it
overall
really
good

nice
roasty

and
a
nice

has
some
really

perhaps

some
roasted

also
come
out

a

at

carbonation
nice
english
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
particularly
in
terms
of
the
abv
too
bad
its
not
available
in
sixers
it
would
make
a
great
session
brown
oh
the
glee
when
i
saw
this
first
batch
dan
paquette
brew
st
botolph
aka
boston
like
the
great
label
depicts
well
from
the
colonial
period
nice
big
bottle
that
poured
an
unfiltered
opaque
hazy
ruddybrown
leaving
a
thin
whitish
head
for
a
short
bit
an
aroma
full
of
wet
grasses
dry
grains
sour
fermenting
and
lemon
peel
the
aroma
had
a
bit
more
of
a
nutty
malt
to
it
and
a
nice
mildly
sour
rustic
farm
ale
taste
hearty
and
full
of
denseness
i
really
shouldve
brought
out
the
stein
for
this
one
now
to
find
it
on
draught
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
big
bubbly
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
before
sticking
itself
to
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
caramel
brown
sugar
and
sweet
malts
tastes
is
sweet
malts
with
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
has
a
hint
of
spicy
yeast
in
there
as
well
crisp
carbonation
medium
body
light
syrupy
mouthfeel
great
little
session
brown
i
wish
they
put
this
in
a
six
pack
id
buy
it
all
the
time
enjoyed
on
tap
at
vee
vee
where
i
believe
it
has
a
permanent
home
pours
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
some
lace
deep
cloudy
amber
color
some
yeast
settles
out
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
earthy
nose
flavor
is
a
strange
grainy
coffee
some
sweetness
burnt
coffee
finish
6
45
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
this
is
solid
but
not
outstanding
brown
ale
dense
yet
a
fluffy
tan
head
rests
on
the
surface
for
a
good
long
time
rather
hoppy
aroma
with
some
citrus
and
flowers
with
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
was
overall
rather
unbalanced
rather
perhaps
it
was
too
balanced
there
was
no
differentiating
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
for
me
so
there
was
no
real
flavor
one
way
or
the
other
it
was
just
beer
i
expected
something
malty
and
instead
got
something
not
so
malty
but
not
so
hoppy
either
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
live
in
ma
and
want
to
support
your
local
brewery
i
preferred
the
pt
saison
over
this
one
sorry
i
hope
chapter
3
of
the
pretty
things
book
is
a
ore
enjoyable
one
another
successful
offering
from
pretty
things
that
makes
2
for
2
thus
far
this
brew
has
a
good
malt
profile
and
sweetness
the
malts
are
balanced
by
a
good
roasted
component
that
still
leaves
a
nice
lingering
sweetness
in
the
finish
this
is
an
easy
drinking
tasty
brown
ale
im
a
sucker
for
a
brown
ale
with
some
character
and
this
has
it
id
certainly
have
this
again
pretty
things
is
now
2
for
2
in
my
book
its
got
a
nice
drinkability
to
it
plenty
of
interesting
things
going
on
but
mellow
refreshing
and
very
approachable
an
excellent
beer
and
im
not
even
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
im
officially
really
looking
forward
to
the
next
release
from
pretty
things
nice
one
on
cask
would
be
a
treat
id
love
to
try
this
in
a
flight
of
browns
i
think
it
would
fare
well
overall
a
good
brown
ale
or
old
ale
complex
but
not
necessarily
memorable
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
hard
to
catagorize
but
definitely
one
to
toss
into
the
mix
when
it
comes
to
beer
wine
and
cheese
parties
drinkability
a
very
good
and
interesting
beer
which
i
will
have
again
not
as
tasty
as
some
english
browns
i
have
had
but
it
is
a
winner
mouthfeel
is
good
and
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
another
quality
beer
from
pretty
things
that
will
keep
me
picking
up
their
offerings
in
the
future
again
you
need
to
know
the
intentions
behind
the
brew
its
not
really
meant
to
be
a
typical
english
brown
dann
paquette
actually
said
that
this
uses
an
altbier
yeast
and
is
finished
with
a
relatively
neutral
belgian
strain
this
would
certainly
explain
the
fruit
and
spice
characters
d
very
inviting
and
drinkable
i
imagine
as
a
session
beer
different
notes
and
subtleties
would
come
out
this
drinks
pretty
well
for
the
flavor
profile
another
wellconstructed
effort
from
the
gentlemen
in
holyoke
picked
up
a
bomber
at
the
bauer
tasting
for
5
99
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
huge
creamy
tan
head
very
dark
brown
in
color
slight
carbonation
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
smelled
like
a
whiff
of
cocoa
powder
taste
was
quite
pleasant
but
mild
there
was
quite
a
lot
of
malt
with
a
nice
flavor
of
chocolate
biscuits
flavors
did
not
stand
out
immensely
but
i
can
see
how
that
would
help
to
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
did
not
really
notice
the
abv
after
hearing
what
mr
paquette
had
to
say
this
evening
i
can
really
see
his
british
brewing
style
influenced
here
as
well
as
his
idea
to
brew
an
oldschool
style
historical
bostoninspired
brew
pours
much
darker
than
i
expected
beautiful
reddish
highlights
when
held
up
to
light
very
smooth
mouth
feel
with
tastes
of
toffee
carmel
and
nuts
dries
to
a
very
light
hops
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
great
brown
ales
poured
an
amber
brown
with
a
thick
light
brown
creamy
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
leaves
no
lacing
smells
warm
and
of
toffee
malt
and
some
roasted
nuts
taste
is
great
with
the
toffee
coming
through
at
first
then
the
roasted
nuts
and
some
hint
of
hops
to
a
finish
that
doesnt
linger
very
smooth
and
light
feel
overall
great
beer
even
for
those
who
normally
avoid
dark
beers
i
think
they
might
still
find
this
accessible
its
remarkably
easy
to
drink
and
for
those
who
are
looking
for
a
little
more
flavor
in
their
beer
its
still
here
nicely
done
nice
toffee
notes
decent
body
my
favorite
duclaw
i
use
to
think
sweet
baby
jesus
was
their
best
but
i
think
this
is
more
enjoyable
to
more
people
great
in
every
way
o
overall
this
beer
is
flavored
as
advertised
but
is
not
overly
sweet
which
i
was
worried
about
easy
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
and
pretty
enjoyable
smells
much
better
than
it
tastes
o
a
flavorful
americanstyle
brown
listed
as
an
english
brown
but
tastes
too
hoppy
although
also
listed
as
only
22
ibus
seems
like
at
least
double
that
go
figger
with
both
a
high
degree
of
carameltoffee
malt
sweetness
and
balancing
hop
bitterness
pleasing
o
not
gonna
get
this
again
but
it
was
decent
i
would
really
like
to
see
the
toffee
in
a
bigger
form
along
with
the
nuttiness
of
a
good
brown
amp
up
the
alcohol
too
pours
a
medium
cloudy
brown
with
no
head
aroma
and
taste
is
sweet
caramel
with
a
mildly
toasted
toffee
and
nutty
flavor
and
mild
bitterness
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
on
the
palate
finishes
with
toasted
caramel
malt
toffee
with
some
nutty
undertones
and
mild
bitterness
overall
a
good
drinking
brew
tasty
and
easy
going
down
very
toffee
forward
nice
sweet
and
malty
and
certainly
something
i
would
get
again
if
i
was
in
the
area
that
said
of
all
the
duclaw
beers
i
had
on
my
trip
this
is
the
one
that
did
not
blow
me
away
decentlooking
beer
offwhite
head
quickly
and
fully
diminishes
smell
is
well
very
much
as
the
label
implies
toffee
also
nutty
with
a
little
chocolate
light
vanilla
taste
follows
suit
almost
exactly
no
surprises
from
the
initial
smell
the
body
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
and
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
forced
but
its
better
than
i
expected
doubt
id
seek
it
out
again
but
not
bad
overall
a
rather
decent
and
much
drier
then
anticipated
nut
brown
ale
fairly
nice
an
outstanding
brown
ale
great
taste
of
tofffe
and
carmel
puts
a
big
smile
on
my
face
so
enjoy
the
beer
a
welcome
addition
to
the
brown
ale
family
taste
it
drink
it
love
it
just
a
great
beer
that
wont
disappiont
so
pick
some
up
and
enjoy
av
great
brown
color
with
a
taste
smooth
brown
ale
that
will
asking
for
another
this
is
grossly
underrated
and
possibly
the
best
brew
ive
had
from
these
guys
whos
beer
i
always
seem
to
taste
past
its
prime
and
is
always
seemingly
somewhat
oxidized
or
stale
but
not
this
one
extremely
english
in
nature
this
is
a
sweet
brown
ale
with
an
impressive
toffee
aspect
that
while
adding
sweetness
to
an
already
sweet
grainy
beer
also
adds
a
detail
and
a
layer
not
usually
seen
in
the
straightforward
nut
brown
and
to
me
at
least
its
memorable
hazy
pale
brown
color
not
as
clean
as
most
in
the
style
but
holding
a
pretty
solid
inch
of
white
head
and
passing
aromas
of
brown
butter
caramel
sweet
copper
malt
and
english
ale
yeast
the
flavors
all
gel
real
well
with
the
toffee
element
playing
a
prominent
role
not
sure
if
there
are
curious
additives
in
this
beer
such
as
toffee
itself
but
the
grain
bill
does
a
nice
job
of
conveying
one
of
my
favorite
confections
in
the
flavor
here
and
the
english
biscuity
yeast
makes
the
finish
far
more
palatable
and
balanced
that
is
appears
to
be
heading
for
earlier
on
just
a
thin
like
of
sweetness
remains
at
the
finish
carbonation
could
be
ramped
up
a
little
bit
but
i
see
this
one
more
in
a
cask
setting
than
anything
else
and
doesnt
really
need
a
huge
bubble
life
deserves
better
here
on
ba
in
my
humble
opinion
overall
very
drinkable
and
pretty
good
brew
its
nothing
amazing
but
still
something
id
enjoy
to
drink
again
the
smell
is
the
best
part
toffee
kilned
malt
turbinado
brandy
and
tangy
dark
bitter
fruits
in
the
finish
kind
of
simple
but
good
dextrinous
feel
could
be
a
tad
fuller
but
on
par
for
most
brown
ales
carbonation
is
appreciatively
mellow
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
and
hazy
with
a
wisp
of
tan
head
the
aroma
offers
toffee
malt
bread
brown
sugar
a
touch
of
sweet
toffee
among
brown
bread
and
caramel
malt
notes
moderately
low
carbonation
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
back
a
decent
brew
but
not
something
i
feel
compelled
to
have
again
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
sessionable
by
any
standard
this
one
can
hold
its
own
with
any
brown
ale
ive
had
it
may
not
be
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
but
its
very
good
and
ill
certainly
be
buying
more
for
future
consumption
overall
this
brown
ale
was
a
bit
too
sweet
not
as
refreshing
as
i
would
like
in
the
style
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
caramel
color
smell
is
nutty
with
ale
characteristics
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
is
one
you
can
do
with
a
marathon
session
i
typically
enjoy
brown
ales
but
this
one
has
a
very
nice
nutty
finish
with
the
hint
of
caramel
and
sweetness
had
this
on
tap
at
duclaw
this
summer
and
it
is
much
better
on
tap
than
bottle
as
are
their
other
beers
i
believe
duclaw
has
the
greatest
difference
in
taste
between
their
tapped
vs
bottled
products
than
other
breweries
dont
know
if
they
can
improve
that
but
i
would
drink
a
lot
more
of
their
bottled
offerings
if
they
could
the
taste
is
light
with
low
malt
toastiness
and
gentle
sweetness
kind
of
like
a
mild
as
it
has
such
low
flavor
there
is
a
light
yeast
and
diacteyl
taste
as
the
nose
indicates
but
even
as
it
warms
it
is
very
faint
there
is
more
carbonation
than
anything
driving
the
taste
overall
it
is
not
terrible
but
not
great
since
it
is
not
hard
to
enjoy
more
than
1
but
the
lack
of
flavor
makes
you
lose
interest
no
matter
how
sessionable
it
is
overall
a
thinner
brown
ale
with
good
nutty
flavor
o
everything
about
this
brew
is
nice
nothing
more
nothing
less
like
most
brown
ales
it
feels
safe
normally
safe
isnt
good
but
considering
some
of
the
duds
ive
had
from
this
brewery
in
the
past
oh
hai
serum
i
guess
for
once
ill
say
better
safe
than
sorry
this
ones
on
the
pile
of
beers
id
gladly
drink
again
as
long
as
i
dont
have
to
buy
a
6pack
of
it
i
dont
know
what
to
think
about
this
beer
certainly
nowhere
near
the
most
interesting
of
brown
ales
out
there
weird
that
there
is
alcohol
heat
in
a
4
8
beer
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
but
it
was
certainly
worth
trying
once
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
and
unlike
any
other
brown
ale
that
ive
had
instead
of
being
either
malt
of
hop
forward
its
very
nutty
and
toffeelike
even
more
than
some
nut
brown
ales
that
ive
had
very
very
good
ill
certainly
be
getting
this
again
this
is
a
well
crafted
example
of
a
difficult
style
to
brew
simple
yet
interesting
quite
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
again
with
friends
overall
nice
seriously
nutty
take
on
an
english
brown
easy
to
drink
but
pleasantly
complex
euphoria
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
nutty
and
toffee
enriched
aroma
the
taste
is
creamy
sweet
lots
of
nut
flavors
finished
with
a
sweet
candy
like
toffee
flavors
good
medium
body
like
no
flavors
are
overpowering
overall
its
a
very
nice
rich
and
flavor
brown
much
underrated
overall
id
never
reach
for
this
again
anyway
poured
nice
int
my
pint
glass
big
ass
frothy
head
that
you
could
float
a
bottle
cap
on
it
as
the
dude
from
sam
adams
would
say
i
couldnt
really
smell
much
but
no
offense
i
dont
smell
very
well
it
lacks
body
which
i
think
really
hurts
this
beer
i
expected
a
little
more
malt
balance
in
this
on
but
its
just
not
there
i
pick
up
the
toffee
a
little
coffee
vanilla
and
then
it
just
fades
to
nothing
o
a
unique
twist
on
a
nut
brown
color
and
malt
body
certainly
trend
more
on
the
amber
side
which
make
the
beer
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
filling
its
good
to
see
smaller
beers
like
duclaw
trying
different
offerings
and
trying
to
find
their
niche
in
the
market
loads
of
coffee
on
the
nose
clean
light
brown
color
really
nice
lacingsome
roasty
notes
on
the
nose
as
well
flavor
is
upfront
and
maple
syrup
smoked
complexity
coffee
starts
with
a
creamy
midpalate
that
transfers
to
a
pleasant
grainyness
and
a
hint
of
peanut
shells
sweet
come
finish
overall
by
far
the
best
nut
brown
i
ever
had
overall
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
brown
ale
but
there
is
not
to
much
the
make
it
stand
out
about
this
brew
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
a
bit
underwhelming
very
tasty
and
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
this
seems
like
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
to
pick
up
as
a
6pk
like
it
gets
better
as
the
session
continues
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
reddish
brown
colored
body
with
a
small
head
that
hangs
for
a
while
then
lays
down
to
a
thin
lace
on
top
the
smell
has
a
roasteynutty
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
a
rich
nutty
flavor
with
some
chocolate
to
it
it
has
some
sweetness
to
it
and
detect
the
toffee
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
really
good
and
overall
a
really
good
brown
ale
o
this
beer
tasted
good
but
the
ridiculous
head
and
nose
kind
of
put
me
off
average
overall
lighter
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
little
thin
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
i
enjoyed
the
cocoa
and
vanilla
flavors
that
seem
to
shine
through
the
thinner
backbone
o
not
bad
but
very
easy
drinking
tastes
a
lot
different
from
the
bottle
than
on
tap
imo
overall
this
is
not
impressing
me
for
the
first
offering
from
this
brewery
a
shame
since
i
got
singles
of
every
beer
the
house
of
1000
offered
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
very
easy
going
down
but
not
something
i
found
to
be
terribly
enjoyable
either
the
nose
was
the
best
aspect
of
this
with
the
flavor
just
not
working
out
too
well
d
a
great
aroma
with
a
slightly
disappointing
flavor
and
a
grassy
character
that
is
a
little
off
putting
half
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
clear
copper
body
aroma
just
as
advertised
caramel
malts
toffee
and
nuts
flavor
follows
this
as
well
with
toffee
prevalent
providing
excellent
sweetness
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
and
nice
creamy
body
overall
a
very
flavorful
beer
which
each
flavor
noticed
and
no
clashing
o
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
strongly
recommend
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
one
at
bwi
whenever
i
have
time
it
is
pretty
light
not
too
heavy
though
not
sweet
and
has
a
load
of
dry
roasted
nuttiness
meh
flavors
taste
a
little
artificial
not
bad
overall
i
guess
i
prefer
more
nuanced
flavors
d
a
very
solid
respectable
english
brown
ale
lots
of
flavor
and
character
for
4
8
abv
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
even
if
it
is
a
slightly
above
average
english
brown
ale
o
this
is
an
excellent
toffee
nut
brown
ale
very
smooth
flavor
and
aftertaste
o
nice
drinkable
brown
ale
but
nothing
new
or
exciting
got
this
in
the
rep
your
region
if
pours
with
short
head
with
no
lacing
and
only
a
bit
of
retention
aroma
is
nutty
toasty
biscuit
with
some
coffee
flavor
has
a
bit
more
roast
and
coffee
with
a
nice
mild
caramel
sweetness
really
enjoyable
coffee
is
a
really
nice
complement
to
a
bit
of
a
mild
nuanced
nutty
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
fine
carbonation
happy
the
growler
held
up
so
well
o
im
ok
with
it
it
was
a
huge
hit
with
my
gf
reddishbrown
in
color
with
an
orange
hue
and
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
short
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
toffee
nuts
and
dark
sweet
malt
aromas
with
molasses
and
vanilla
smooth
creamy
feel
with
refreshing
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
toffee
and
molasses
flavors
up
front
with
a
bit
of
metallic
edge
nut
flavors
come
through
the
middle
as
the
sweet
dark
caramel
malt
backbones
continues
from
beginning
to
end
a
touch
of
spicy
floral
hop
flavor
near
the
finish
as
this
finishes
clean
and
dry
o
very
tasty
and
full
flavored
for
a
low
abv
beer
perfect
session
beer
that
offers
good
complexity
of
flavor
and
faint
malt
o
wow
this
was
a
winner
i
havent
had
the
base
euforia
but
this
was
awesome
the
addition
of
the
gingerbread
really
added
something
like
i
said
this
was
christmascookie
in
a
glass
t
almoust
like
the
smell
but
lighter
than
expected
it
shows
a
medium
body
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
brown
liquid
the
head
is
soapy
and
light
tan
colored
the
smell
had
a
light
nuttiness
to
it
and
had
heavier
amount
of
coffee
on
then
anything
else
the
taste
has
a
subtle
amount
of
roasted
nut
flavors
the
coffee
dominates
most
of
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
carbonation
kind
of
on
the
flatish
side
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
pretty
good
and
was
nice
to
try
keep
up
the
good
work
duclaw
dnice
flavor
but
light
mouthfeel
not
too
sweet
but
not
a
flavorful
as
i
would
have
liked
presented
with
absolutely
no
head
an
appealing
mahogany
color
toffee
and
butterscotch
aroma
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
in
the
nose
toffee
and
nutty
flavors
begin
leading
to
some
sweetness
that
is
just
balanced
enough
by
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
a
bit
thin
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
this
particularly
with
the
nice
aroma
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
drinkability
enjoyable
flavor
but
light
mouthfeel
without
being
sweet
made
this
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
rich
very
rich
and
oh
so
smooth
looked
great
in
the
glass
dark
amber
almost
black
but
with
golden
highlights
small
head
that
lasted
awhile
the
toffee
scent
hits
you
as
you
raise
the
glass
begging
you
to
taste
it
the
flavor
is
coffee
carmel
and
sweet
fantastic
flavor
but
i
couldnt
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
excellent
afterdinner
drink
drinkability
good
drinkability
although
the
flavors
could
get
too
intense
i
brought
home
a
growler
i
liked
it
so
much
i
am
with
the
brothers
on
this
one
i
sure
wish
it
was
still
available
here
in
central
fl
this
brown
ale
is
scrumptious
o
very
good
brown
ale
excellent
profile
and
flavors
overall
classic
english
brown
ale
not
big
on
browns
like
these
but
its
better
than
newcastle
just
not
enough
interesting
flavors
going
on
here
overall
im
glad
to
get
through
this
sampler
pack
although
the
sale
of
this
beer
provides
some
funding
to
a
local
burn
foundation
it
doesnt
make
the
beer
any
better
mouth
feel
is
about
medium
lighter
than
the
dark
color
might
indicate
o
i
have
never
had
a
english
style
brown
and
this
beer
wants
to
make
me
try
some
other
to
better
understand
the
style
it
has
some
of
the
same
qualities
of
a
good
porter
or
stout
overall
this
a
good
beer
and
for
a
fireman
themed
brewery
i
was
impressed
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
the
dry
malty
character
mixes
well
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
one
o
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
well
rounded
taste
of
malts
hops
and
carmel
would
like
it
to
have
a
little
more
flavor
and
some
bite
but
a
decent
effort
and
an
easy
drinking
brown
would
have
another
overall
a
very
unexpected
treat
from
this
brewery
i
have
another
beer
by
them
and
hopefully
its
as
good
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
again
im
not
much
on
beers
like
this
but
it
was
still
good
and
it
supports
firefighters
which
since
i
am
one
is
always
awesome
o
the
smell
promised
a
lot
but
the
beer
failed
to
deliver
it
is
just
weak
not
enough
substance
to
it
either
flavor
or
mouthfeel
wise
to
balance
out
the
initial
punch
of
flavor
total
disappointment
not
bad
just
not
very
good
or
worth
drinking
12
oz

d
i
had
more
than
one
and
would
again
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
clean
looking
brown
color
the
head
is
a
shade
of
tan
that
doesnt

much
retention
the

the

3
5
overall
its
a
good
beer
could
have
a
few
of
these
easily
and
would
be
in
the
fridge
if
it
was
available
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
batch
it
seemed
to
work
better
in
their
mixed
offering
pass
on
this
one
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
would
buy
this
anytime
great
job
however
it
had
great
mouthfeel
and
i
felt
like
i
could
sit
and
drink
this
all
day
pours
a
deep
amber
hue
flirting
with
brown
but
when
backlit
is
ruby
red
the
aroma
is
strictly
caramel
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
flavor
is
also
packed
with
caramel
with
a
dash
of
buttery
toast
it
light
in
body
and
pretty
bland
overall
more
representative
of
an
english
brown
having
little
bitterness
light
on
hops
and
just
not
enough
depth
for
me
the
first
time
i
had
backdraft
brown
i
was
blown
away
i
still
am
its
an
insanely
tasty
brown
ale
it
has
all
of
the
characteristics
i
look
for
in
the
style
highly
recommended
an
easy
to
drink
brown
ale
will
definitely
consider
it
again
taste
is
somewhat
light
and
creamy
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
up
front
and
some
nutty
notes
on
the
finish
sweet
notes
are
more
evident
on
the
finish
than
elsewhere
on
the
palate
a
light
bitterness
peaks
through
briefly
feel
is
a
bit
full
yet
a
bit
sweet
which
keeps
the
drinkability
in
check
a
decent
brown
ale
yet
quite
simple
in
nature
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
but
very
crisp
a
little
too
highly
carbonated
however
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
until
i
took
a
sip
mildly
drinkable
but
not
particularly
memorable
d
this
has
a
great
look
and
smell
but
the
thin
body
and
uninteresting
taste
disappointed
me
served
in
a
pint
glass
color
is
a
moderatelydark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
persists
for
a
bit
before
falling
nose
is
quite
plain
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
bread
the
taste
is
bready
with
some
light
sweetness
decent
body
with
normal
carbonation
levels
really
just
dont
have
too
much
to
say
about
this
one
nice
balance
of
caramel
and
coffee
notes
hoppy
but
not
overdone
finished
with
a
pleasing
coffee
taste
to
bad
it
was
only
a
tasting
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
mostly
due
to
the
fact
that
it
drank
nicely
and
is
only
4
5
i
could
see
this
as
an
anytime
of
the
year
beer
but
i
think
i
would
prefer
this
in
the
fall
to
winter
even
at
4
5
it
made
me
feel
very
comfortable
drinkability
wish
i
could
walk
into
any
bar
find
this
on
tap
id
drink
several
pints
sleep
like
a
baby
pretty
good
not
great
this
isnt
a
great
brown
ale
but
its
a
very
good
one
for
something
which
is
named
after
a
type
of
fire
which
is
supposed
to
catch
you
by
surprise
backdraft
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
so
that
more
than
compensates
for
this
shortcoming
i
would
definitely
get
this
beer
again
even
if
it
isnt
an
excellent
one
drinkability
this
is
an
outstanding
brown
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
had
very
drinkable
flavorful
and
sessionable
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
d
goes
down
smooth
and
having
another
one
could
very
easily
be
done
drinkability
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
extremely
sessionable
beer
and
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
i
could
definitely
see
myself
getting
this
again
and
really
enjoying
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
toffee
taste
is
good
malts
toffee
and
nuts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
quality
brew
hook
ladder
backdraft
brown
is
overall
pretty
tasty
mouthfeel
is
lacking
but
the
flavors
are
right
on
carbonation
is
complimentary
not
stand
out
but
what
brown
ale
is
i
think
they
definitely
nailed
the
style
low
alcohol
good
flavor
and
really
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
brown
ale
overall
this
was
a
decent
brown
ale
that
i
would
have
no
problem
revisiting
in
the
future
poured
a
darkclear
with
a
decent
head
aroma
i
thought
smelled
like
a
cleaning
solution
and
first
sip
was
a
little
metalic
or
soapy
kinda
hard
to
describe
it
was
a
clean
glass
too
but
once
it
warmed
up
a
touch
it
was
a
whole
new
beer
dark
roasted
malt
with
what
seems
to
be
a
spicy
dark
belgian
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
brown
but
wait
for
a
warmer
brew
maybe
upper
40s
i
wouldnt
go
too
far
out
of
my
far
this
one
its
not
bad
at
all
just
nothing
tremendously
noteworthy
i
have
to
give
the
company
a
nod
for
their
charity
concept
this
is
a
more
well
crafted
beer
than
their
golden
thumbs
in
the
middle
for
me
on
this
one
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
average
for
an
english
brown
ale
the
unbalanced
flavor
and
overcarbonation
make
it
a
tough
one
to
drink
nice
looking
clear
auburn
body
thin
beige
head
spotty
lace
pretty
weak
aroma
light
brown
malts
and
light
roasted
notes
toffee
based
malt
flavor
gives
the
beer
a
nice
base
a
little
roastiness
and
some
light
candied
flavors
give
this
beer
a
little
depth
unique
and
decent
enough
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
a
brown
ale
is
right
up
my
alley
but
not
as
dark
as
i
prefer
poured
an
iced
tea
color
with
a
fair
head
smell
of
faint
caramel
nuttiness
and
a
slight
hop
pine
taste
is
smooth
but
kind
of
one
dimensional
with
a
nutty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
back
certainly
a
step
up
from
their
golden
ale
d
well
im
not
blissfully
impressed
but
this
will
be
some
decent
stuff
for
the
next
few
days
in
the
absence
of
any
porters
or
stouts
at
our
local
beer
store
lately
d
a
nice
tasting
brown
ale
it
certainly
is
worth
a
try
brown
ale
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
it
is
a
good
one
for
a
session
style
and
hook
ladder
has
a
quality
brown
ale
to
fit
the
bill
i
like
this
beer
have
only
tried
it
a
couple
of
times
but
i
could
easily
see
myself
revising
my
rating
to
boost
it
up
a
little
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
drink
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
good
beer
if
you
want
to
have
more
than
a
few
d
low
to
easy
drinking
abv
the
flavors
are
just
a
bit
edgy
for
me
to
session
a
hair
filling
the
carbonation
bite
is
bit
unpleasant
at
times
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
enjoyed
a
lot
d
delicious
english
brown
thats
ohsodrinkable
i
have
to
compliment
hook
ladder
on
how
easy
this
goes
down
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
roastiness
or
thin
body
of
this
brown
decent
atmosphere
appearance
is
pretty
solid
although
not
all
that
exciting
and
nose
is
pretty
basic
and
subtle
but
pleasing
good
flavor
again
nothing
complex
but
nice
combination
of
components
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
will
definately
have
this
beer
again
it
has
some
very
nice
elements
for
a
great
price
d
great
brown
ale
i
like
how
it
starts
sweet
then
goes
slightly
bitter
and
has
a
short
lasting
sweet
aftertaste
an
all
around
solid
brown
ale
a
sessionable
treat
a
decent
brown
ale
brown
ales
are
not
my
favorite
and
this
one
is
okay
review
notes
taken

very
tasty
great
take
on
the
style
good
drinkability
ive
had
it
on
tap
as
well
and
like
most
ales
it
goes
down
better
on
draft
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
think
everyone
should
at
least
buy
a
single
if
available
drinkability
a
good
brown
ale
not
a
total
standout
but
certainly
a
sessionable
beer
pours
a
dark
ruddy
mahogany
brown
hue
with
a
light
beige
head
that
forms
thick
and
dwindles
slowly
chunks
of
scattered
lacing
are
left
clinging
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
a
roasted
caramel
accent
about
it
with
light
herbal
hops
with
a
nutty
finish
to
it
all
flavors
are
a
muddled
watery
mess
of
roasted
malt
and
weird
chocolate
caramel
coated
fruit
no
real
hops
the
finish
tastes
like
muddy
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
pretty
thin
for
a
brown
but
finishes
with
the
cloying
residual
sugar
muddled
mess
i
tried
to
describe
in
the
flavor
im
guessing
this
is
a
contract
brew
by
high
falls
but
im
not
sure
drinkability
overall
is
pretty
weak
not
something
i
will
ever
look
for
again
pretty
bland
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
not
bad
but
nothing
to
really
recommend

very
nice

on
of
my
favorite
styles
thanks
to
my
pal
chaz
over
at
realbeer
for
this
bottle
poured
into
my
sly
fox
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
medium
chestnut
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
lingering
light
ecru
foam
aromas
and
flavors
are
of
medium
roasted
grains
lightly
nutty
hazelnuts
milk
and
bittersweet
chocolate
nicely
roasted
and
subtly
smokey
coffee
beans
a
good
dose
of
caramel
malt
backdraft
is
approaching
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
adequate
carbonation
a
tasty
example
of
an
english
brown
newcastle
should
be
ashamed
d
pretty
good
brown
easy
drinking
and
smooth
with
enough
hops
to
add
spark
not
at
all
boring
but
not
super
complex
either
d
smooth
brown
ale
with
enough
malt
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
i
could
go
for
a
few
pints
of
this
d
a
nice
beer
for
any
time
it
could
go
really
well
with
some
bratwurst
and
sauerkraut
i
read
the
beeradvocate
review
with
this
beer
and
agree
very
interesting
beer
will
buy
again
and
spend
more
time
with
it
i
think
hook
ladder
are
on
to
something
with
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
good
low
carbonation
a
nice
chewy
body
still
just
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
very
nice
plus
some
of
the
proceeds
go
helping
burn
victims
nice
pours
out
a
dark
brown
beer
with
ruby
tones
when
viewed
through
lights
has
a
decent
malty
smell

itno
hop
aroma
to
mention
taste
is
malty
but
dryno
sweetness
to
mentionslightly
astringentvery
little
in
the
way
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nicenot
too
much
or
too
little
very
drinkable
i
like
this
one
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
the
head
stuck
around
a
short
while
i
had
this
after
the
ember
amber
from
hook
and
ladder
and
i
am
much
happier
with
this
brew
its
everything
a
brown
ale
should
be
really
i
can
taste
the
hops
ever
so
slightly
and
its
roasted
malty
flavor
is
mild
as
well
its
not
an
overbearing
taste
at
all
nor
does
it
have
an
offensive
smell
some
improvements
could
be
the
overall
taste
however
its
not
a
severe
problem
notes
overall
nice
beer
and
a
standout
from
the
mixed
12pack
very
light
flavor
watery
the
chocolate
is
just
about
the
only
noticeable
flavor
and
even
thats
watery
im
not
impressed
good
looking
beer
but
its
all
downhill
after
that
hopefully
ember
amber
fares
better
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
one
which
would
flow
easily
one
after
the
other
or
on
just
about
any
evening
eric

the

that
average
flavor
for

maltly
semisweet
maybe
a
little
chocolate
hint
minimal

bitterness
the
beer
has
a
nice
feel
and
easy
to
drink
in
quantity
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
but
with
no
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
nice
scent
hints
of
malt
but
no
deep
earthy
aroma
or
real

nice
taste
malty
very
little
hint
of
the
citrus
hop
presence
they
promised
on
the
label
with
cascalde
hops
not
the
deep
earthy
ent
draught
i
like
as
a
brown
ale
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
with
a
tiny
sweet
finish
not
the
best
brown
ale
although
i
would
never
turn
one
down
either

with
little
or
no
head
dark
brown
colored
liquid
aromas
of
sweet
malts
but
not
much
else
typical
brown
ale
flavor
slightly
sweet
and
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
i
would
call
this
medium
to
light
bodied
and
kind
of
thin
average
mouthfeel
good
drinkibility
smooth
sessional
poured
brown
with
some
ruby
red
tints
when
held
to
the
light
average
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
were
slightly
malty
sweet
but
rather
faint
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
average
for
the
style
flavors
were
of
mild
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
hints
of
dry
grass
little
hop
character
although
balance
seems
ok
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
one
didnt
do
much
for
me
it
was
drinkable
and
not
at
all
bad
but
its
nothing
i
could
recommend
as
a
good
brown
ale
drinkability
light
crisp
and
moderately
flavorful
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
not
a
stellar
beer
but
one
ill
definitely
consider
when
im
not
looking
for
something
more
expensive
this
one
just
needs
some
more
flavor
drinkability
very
drinkable
solid
session
beer
overallnothing
about
this
beer
really
wowed
me
an
ok
beer
but
not
great
disappointed
overall
its
decent
and
drinkable
final
thoughts
hook
ladder
provides
a
decent
entry
into
the
brown
ale
category
but
it
lacked
individuality
or
flare
in
a
world
of
micro
brews
beers
like
this
can
get
lost
the
price
point
worked
well
6

for
a
six
pack
which
will
make
me
give
some
more
of
these
brews
a
second
chance
i
will
grab
a
couple
more
of
thse
in
the
future
i
was
not
to
impressed
overall
so
i
will
not
go
out
looking
for
this
beer
in
the
future
d
not
a
great
beer
but
nothing
terribly
wrong
with
it
either
i
would
not

id
drink
this

overall
much
better

i
would

the

fits
the

other

detractors
there
is
something
of
a
drinkability
maybe
its
general
mildness
overall
a
lackluster
brown
d
probably
one
of
the
better
browns
i
can
recall
the

you
certainly

with

with

smells
of
roasted

vanilla
it
tastes
of
the

roasted

hints

with
a
somewhat
buttery

the

just
a

nice
with
the

halfway
done
with

i
start
to
taste
green
apple
skins
so
slight
hops
but
just
barely
a
hint
the
mouth
feel
is
good
it
goes
down
nice
could
drink
a

of

and
not
get
bored
overall
a
pretty
good
nut
brown
the
mouth
starts
well
but
thins
a
bit
at
the
end
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
for
the
wrong
reasons
i
expected
more
flavor
from
such
a
complex
smell
this
beer
tricked
me
d
not
a
bad
brown
but
there
are
many
more
out
there
that
i
would
rather
spend
my
money
on
drinkability
i
had
3
or
4
of
these
and
it
was
certainly
a
highly
sessionable
brew
especially
if
youre
into
the
style
nothing
mindblowing
but
pretty
good
overall
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
in
body
well
lighter
than
it
should
have
been
the
beer
has
an
overall
watery
quality
to
it
just
not
much
there
easy
to
drink
probably
a
good
session
beer
but
i
feel
it
definitely
lacks
in
body
needs
something
more
this
is
one
that
ill
not
be
picking
up
nice
to
try
but
again
im
glad
i
didnt
spend
money
on
it
nothing
comdem
it
but
nothing
redeeming
either
hook
ladder
backdraft
brown
not
only
didnt
set
my
world
ablaze
it
left
me
cold
i
think
its
great
when
breweries
give
a
portion
of
their
proceeds
to
such
worthy
causes
as
local
fire
and
rescue
teams
it
would
be
even
better
if
they
would
maximize
those
charitable
contributions
by
brewing
beer
that
people
want
to
buy
a

was

appropriately

brown
color
the
head
was
impressive
pillowy
two
fingers
thick
and
it
both
retained
and
laced
well
the
aromas
were
very
faint
toasted
malt
and
an
illdefined
toffeecaramel
sweetness
the
flavors
were
toasted
malt
and
nuts
at
first
but
a
little
floral
hops
showed
up
later
rather
simple
but
not
unlikable
the
mouthfeel
was
average
but
it
does
come
off
as
quite
sessionable

a
smooth

flavor
initially
mocha

a
damn
good
brown
ale
this
beer
poured
a
deeper
brown
than
i
anticipated
it
was
actually
almost
opaque
there
was
about
an
inch
off
white
colored
head
that
quickly
disappeared
there
is
definitely
a
malt
scent
to
the
beer
and
a
very
slight
metallic
after
taste
the
drinkability
is
definitely
there
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
recommended
with
a
good
burger
or
marsala
steak
pours
a
nice
light
beige
head
of
over
two
fingers
width
great
sasparilla
brown
with
clear
garnet
highlights
good
sticky
lacing
thearoma
has
good
roasted
and
even
faintly
smoked
malts
then
some
very
subtle
coffee
and
shitty
chocolate
notes
that
would
come
from
an
american
advent
calendar
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
for
any
brown
ale
light
roasted
malts
maybe
a
touch
of
coffee
grounds
very
watery
the
hops
are
the
only
flavor
that
lingers
mixed
with
some
burnt
malt
flavors
would
be
sessionable
if
it
had
more
flavor
really
nothing
special
from
this
brew
as
far
as
a
brown
ale
goes
it
doesnt
compare
to
any
of
the
more
wellestablished
in
the
style
nothing
bad
just
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
amongst
the
crowd
i
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
but
its
worth
a
try
served
in
a
pint
glass
at
bohemian
pizza
in
litchfield
ct
this
brew
has
a
dark
root
beer
color
with
a
thin
but
steady
light
tan
head
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mild
coffee
malt
with
a
touch
of
citrus
wheat
the
taste
is
a
fairly
bright
and
aqueous
walnut
and
sour
apple
some
light
malt
and
floral
hops
spritely
carbonation
easy
drinking
some
caramel
sweetness
at
the
finish
not
bad
not
great
drinkability
very
good
brown
ale
easy
drinking
would
try
this
again
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
good
beer
it
didnt
reinvent
the
wheel
but
its
drinkable
notes
decenti
would
have
it
again
slightly
thin
mouth
feel
with
some
creamy
texture
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
a
sessionable
beer
solid
cb
brown
ale
cheers
bitches
d
its
ok
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
dark
brown
colored
ale
with
a
thick
foamy
head
aroma
is
toasted
almond
taste
is
nutty
with
a
slight
aftertaste
of
coffee
very
creamysmooth
and
drinkable
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
again
and
would
recommend
to
my
buddiesgood
job
by
hook
and
ladder
brewing
company
this
tasting
was
from
the
last
bottle
of
a
six
pack
and
may
have
suffered
from
age
i
do
remember
very
much
enjoying
the
first
sample
but
ill
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
and
you
can
judge
this
one
for
yourself
had
a
sample
of
this
last
night
at
the
beer
tent
at
taste
of
syracuse
deep
clear
chestnut
appearance
with
a
tan
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
hazlenuts
and
butterscotch
taste
is
balanced
and
smooth
the
hop
bitterness
is
there
but
the
flavor
is
never
overpowering
again
hazlenuts
and
butterscotch
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
medium
bodied
with
good
drinkability
d
nice
brown
ale
and
i
would
have
rated
this
a
4
5
but
it
almost
became
too
sweet
towards
the
end
overall
a
very
good
beer
while
the
hops
and
the
malts
are
each
very
pronounced
its
almost
like
theyre
fighting
for
supremacy
with
each
taking
their
turn
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
offering
good
crystal
and
chocolate
malts
are
featured
in
the
initial
taste
excellent
hop
balance
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
would
suggest
but
not
exactly
dry
either
the
bitter
hop
balances
the
beer
during
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
wellbalanced
with
some
dry
mocha
flavors
and
mild
hop
the
body
is
this
beers
weak
pointit
is
far
thinner
than
a
typical
aba
good
carbonation
taste
follows
with
the
same
but
without
the
tin
thank
god
very
light
malts
and
a
decent
amount
of
hops
altogether
an
easy
drinking
brown
ale
that
has
decent
balance
the
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
12
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
roasted
and
caramel
malt
thats
a
bit
sweet
yet
dry
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
very
dry
roasted
flavor
that
is
quite
thin
and
watery
it
has
some
caramel
flavor
as
well
but
its
faint
at
best
the
mouthfeel
is
average
also
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
co2
this
is
an
average
brown
ale
it
needs
more
crystal
malt
flavor
and
more
body
its
too
highly
carbonated
with
little
malt
character
this
is
a
very
pleasant
brown
ale
nothing
exotic
or
overly
complex
but
a
very
solid
beer
it
pours
a
ruby
dark
color
that
is
far
from
opaque
plenty
of
light
makes
its
way
through
the
beer
is
very
clear
with
a
tannish
and
smallish
head
hardly
any
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasted
malts
with
some
sweetish
cherry
notes
as
the
beer
warms
the
sweet
malts
make
themselves
more
pronounced
at
things
settle
there
might
be
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
aroma
as
well
but
you
need
to
let
things
settle
down
first
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
some
sweeter
caramels
some
slightly
burnt
malts
a
little
brown
sugar
toffee
with
a
bit
of
dryish
hoppiness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
slightly
medium
bodied
beer
a
touch
creamy
on
the
tongue
with
some
charred
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
either
the
taste
is
a
plesant
malt
with
a
nice
balance
of
the
hops
very
drinkable
but
also
equally
predicatable
which
could
go
both
ways
depending
on
your
disposition
for
me
im
more
than
happy
to
go
back
for
number
two
body
is
a
touch
thin
i
tend
to
like
my
browns
with
a
thicker
mouthfeel
seems
to
mesh
better
with
the
flavor
profile
otherwise
a
highly
drinkable
ale
well
balanced
pour
a
reddishblack
like
a
porter
with
a
decent
but
quickevaporating
head
the
aroma
is
also
porterlike
with
a
strong
dark
malt
character
perhaps
black
patent
malt
the
flavor
is
likewise
dark
with
a
slight
smokiness
a
trace
of
cherry
the
mouthfeel
is
disappointingly
watery
considering
the
powerful
color
and
dark
aroma
id
call
this
more
of
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
it
is
drinkable
but
not
one
to
lose
sleep
over
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
well
blended
between
the
hops
and
malts
so
nothing
really
stands
out
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
very
deep
brown
almost
opaque
one
inch
khaki
colored
head
quickly
disappeared
smells
of
roasted
malt
tastes
of
roasted
malt
with
some
bready
notes
and
a
hint
of
caramel
faint
metallic
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
brown
ale
this
is
a
great
all
around
beer
i
had
with
a
bowl
of
chili
and
enjoyed
every
second
of
it
a
decent
session
ale
but
too
tame
to
be
anywhere
near
remarkable
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
borderline
black
with
a
fluffy
two
finger
tan
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
spotty
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
pretty
nutty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
a
fair
amount
of
citrus
hops
find
their
way
in
the
nose
as
well
if
you
stick
your
nose
down
there
deep
enough
you
can
catch
a
nice
coffee
aroma
too
taste
begins
with
a
light
nut
flavor
and
some
toasted
grains
some
earthy
hops
and
molasses
with
a
woody
aftertaste
pretty
basic
flavor
overall
nothing
too
impressive
the
feel
is
fairly
smooth
with
some
bite
here
and
there
light
to
medium
body
with
a
full
carbonation
nice
drinkable
brown
ale
ive
had
better
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
my
final
thoughts
this
beer
came
out
swinging
and
had
me
very
impressed
at
first
but
as
i
sipped
i
lost
interest
and
thought
of
it
as
a
regular
local
brew
which
it
isnt
my
hats
off
to
all
firefighters
currently
or
formally
in
uniform
cheers
very
drinkable
could
be
nice
to
session
flavorful
without
going
too
far
at
this
point
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
maybe
ill
try
another
i
hate
to
knock
down
a
local
but
this
is
pretty
bad
d
easy
to
drink
and
not
very
impressive
over
all
to
me
it
tasted
like
a
old
boston
lager
with
cascade
hops
i
sampled
a
pint
of
this
brew
ontap
during
a
recent
trip
back
to
the
usa
its
a
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
whispy
tan
head
its
really
a
fairly
averagelooking
brown
ale
the
aroma
is
of
faintly
roasted
grains
and
a
little
malt
very
little
hop
aroma
the
taste
though
is
more
intense
with
the
roastedness
really
coming
through
theres
a
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
a
lot
of
grain
throughtout
the
taste
a
very
low
crabonation
helped
the
beer
medium
to
full
in
body
this
is
a
drinkable
and
very
applealing
if
not
extraordinary
beer
the
drinkability
is
great
i
will
look
for
more
of
this
and
spread
the
word
prosit
mk
call
me
easy
to
please
but
this
was
one
tasty
beer
gorgeous
deep
brown
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
left
quickly
and
laced
the
glass
a
bit
as
it
emptied
carmel
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
cascade
hops
smelled
like
a
nice
german
dunkel
taste
was
roasted
malt
and
a
mild
bitterness
from
the
hops
that
balanced
the
taste
nicely
smooth
is
the
operative
word
here
very
tasty
a
touch
sweet
but
definitely
not
too
much
rich
mouthfeel
and
a
flavor
that
was
consistent
throughout
really
a
great
goto
brown
drinkable
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
isnt
really
a
bad
beer
but
it
certainly
wouldnt
be
the
first
brown
ale
that
i
would
select
deep
copper
brown
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
of
light
caramel
and
nuts
very
light
the
taste
was
some
slightly
roasty
malts
a
little
more
caramel
and
a
somewhat
distracting
sour
acidic
note
perhaps
it
was
the
soapy
taste
from
their
pale
ale
that
in
this
instance
was
masked
somewhat
by
darker
malts
but
im
not
sure
medium
body
and
i
am
sure
that
i
did
not
care
for
this
beer
and
did
not
finish
it
d
this
could
work
as
a
session
beer
because
it
is
not
offensive
in
any
respect
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
first
one
left
me
wanting
to
have
another
nice
brown
smooth
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
bite
but
overall
very
nice
and
balanced
standard
pint
at
crystal
city
sports
bar
alexandria
started
out
good
but
then
came
up
short
this
one
may
be
good
for
those
who
like
a
lighter
brown
ale
but
thats
not
for
me
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
sessionable
as
a
brown
ale
balanced
with
no
overpowering
notes
maybe
not
as
strong
as
others
of
this
style
but
very
solid
pours
with
a
four
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
almost
black
hints
of
mahogany
highlights
the
nose
is
roasted
coffee
light
carbonation
and
medium
body
flavor
is
roasted
coffee
with
some
hoppiness

still
a

nice

caramel

way

just
not

beer
for

im
gonna
feed
them
to
my
soninlaw
man
whats
up
with
these
beers
ive
tried
all
three
and
they
reek
of
minerals
and
phenols
its
like
the
brewing
water
is
all
out
of
whack
the
flavor
has
a
bitter
chocolate
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
but
the
medicinal
phenol
taste
throws
everything
off
it
seems
like
there
might
be
a
decent
brown
ale
hidden
under
the
massive
phenols
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
from
the
bottle
with
a
tall
and
thick
tan
colored
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
then
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
it
smells
of
deep
roasted
malts
and
balanced
out
with
a
piney
hoppy
bitterness
for
a
nice
ale
aroma
it
tastes
pretty
good
too
with
a
deep
roasted
malt
taste
and
a
nice
bitter
and
piny
hoppy
taste
to
balance
out
the
flavor
it
had
a
nice
somewhat
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
i
would
most
likely
get
it
again
because
for
7
for
a
6pack
it
really
isnt
a
bad
choice
at
all
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
still
worth
buying
again
this
brew
is
just
slightly
lacking

one
sip
most
definitely
invites
another
an
excellent
brown
ale
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
that
works
quite
well
being
enjoyed
in
the
winter
months
but
is
a
bit
more
full
than
it
should
be
i
was
a
sucker
for
this
beer
because
of
the
firefighting
theme
it
pours
a
deep
redbrown
with
a
frothy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
bits
of
chocolate
caramel
and
other
dark
malts
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
fairly
dry
with
some
of
the
same
malty
flavors
as
in
the
aroma
the
maltiness
is
overpowered
a
bit
by
the
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
overally
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
the
charitable
donation
isnt
bad
either
taste
starts
off
malty
and
smooth
upfront
with
a
lingering
mild
hop
bitterness
and
roasty
taste
a
second
sip
detects
the
cascades
better
upfront
with
only
a
slight
hint
of
roastiness
quite
drinkable
for
a
brown
ale
not
quite
my
choice
though
but
i
could
drink
this
in
a
session
great
microbrew
from
a
maryland
brewpub
surprised
to
find
it
here
in

but
damn
glad
it
was

i
could

a

it

a
light
coating
on

a

with

it

nice

brown

flavor
is
malty

to
it
roastiness
is
a

underdone
so
this
beer
comes
off
a
bit
too
much
like
a
pale
ale
the
balance
is
nice
with
only
light
hopping
and
mild
estery
flavors
but
boring
and
a
little
too
plain
body
is
medium
with
rather
high
carbonation
not
terrible
but
not
up
to

with
the
others
in
the
tasting
12

gotta
like

was
pleasant
toasted

nutty

just
a

of

no
off
flavors
for
me
creamy
and
rich
for
the
first
half
of
the
glass
it
just
got
a
touch
watery
on
the
finish
but
maybe
i
didnt
drink
it
fast
enough
for
that
reason
i
gave
it
3
5
drinkability
i
would
reach
for
this
one
again
a
local
company
is
starting
to
put
these
in
florida
beer
stores
fine
idea
by
me
its
worth
a
try
very
simialer
to
smuttynoses
old
brown
dog
ale
and
thats
saying
something
the
pour
a
deep
clear
brown
with
a
decent
sized
head
frothy
in
texture
and
a
light
tan
in
color
the
lace
forms
a
decent
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
is
malt
dominated
crisp
fresh
and
sweet
with
the
start
also
sweet
and
nicely
malted
top
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
finish
is
strongly
acidic
hops
are
plentiful
and
spicy
dry
lingering
aftertaste
a
drinkable
beer
but
just
a
bit
more
body
need
to
please
me
notes
i
could
definitely
vision
myself
sitting
down
and
making
this
a
session
brew
every
once
in
a
while
a
beer
comes
along
and
tweaks
my
fancy
this
is
one
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
colored
head
on
the
nose
the
aromas
were
of
toffee
and
caramel
and
slightly
nutty
on
the
palate
you
get
more
toffee
and
caramel
slight
sweet
coffee
flavor
hint
of
chocolate
hop
bitterness
overall
a
very
good
brown
ale
very
good
definitely
give
it
a
try
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
not
very
hoppy
at
all
introduction
is
light
and
energetic
though
not
much
linger
the
finish
is
somewhat
stronger
where
smokey
notes
play
midtongue
the
honey
is
downplayed
which
is
good
i
was
expecting
the
sweetness
to
overpower
the
palette
the
stark
bubble
works
well
with
the
light
almost
crispness
good
beer
i
enjoy
it
a
lot
not
favorite
bit
great
it
was
good
would
probably
go
with
the
lucky
town
pub
ale
if
im
drinking
a
brwon
ale
id
drink
it
again
great
smell
and
body
but
taste
flavored
instead
of
infused
enjoyable
smooth
brown
ale
sweetness
does
not
bother
me
but
may
be
too
much
for
some
looks
like
iced
tea
in
the
glass
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
iced
tea
like
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
honey
taste
is
bready
nutty
honey
is
present
but
not
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
bit
different
but
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
better
than
its
ratings
but
maybe
im
partial
or
feel
nostalgic
or
overly
stoked
because
this
is
im
pretty
darn
sure
my
first
beer
from
the
curious
state
of
alabama
cool
a
decent
brown
ale
sure
maybe
its
a
bit
thin
in
grain
character
for
the
style
but
the
english
ale
yeast
is
nice
and
the
honey
works
really
well
its
vibrant
and
sweet
and
floral
in
the
nose
adds
a
richness
to
a
light
beer
and
brings
the
abv
up
just
enough
it
looks
nice
albeit
a
bit
light
but
it
holds
its
tan
head
well
and
the
nose
presents
chocolate
malt
and
a
nuttiness
that
makes
me
think
almond
the
honey
goes
great
with
that
and
its
a
cool
mix
of
textures
and
flavors
overall
carbonation
is
high
and
its
almost
refreshing
with
how
light
the
body
is
a
clean
finish
with
just
a
little
of
the
english
yeast
character
well
made
maybe
boost
up
the
dark
grain
a
touch
but
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
overall
not
spectacular
but
drinkable
enough
o
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
batch
based
on
previous
comments
but
it
was
a
pure
butter
bomb
i
struggled
through
34
of
a
pbr
before
i
couldnt
take
it
any
more
o
found
this
one
in
montgomery
al
and
drank
in
decateur
al
i
love
to
try
local
brews
id
say
its
good
not
typical
for
the
style
and
as
some
off
flavours
otherwise
its
got
a
great
label
on
the
bottle
and
is
really
not
bad
overall
a
very
nice
brown
ale
the
honey
taste
is
very
slight
which
i
think
is
actually
a
good
thing
or
else
the
beer
would
probably
be
just
too
sweet
theres
also
a
nice
nuttiness
which
i
would
expect
for
a
brown
ale
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
and
theres
a
slight
bit
of
pleasant
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
the
head
on
it
isnt
so
great
and
the
smell
i
wish
was
stronger
but
it
tastes
great
and
has
a
really
good
presence
about
it
bottled
on
date
is
december

2013
pours
out
to
a
quickly
dissipating
head
and
pale
brown
color
aroma
is
very
weak
there
is
some
honey
and
nuts
in
there
flavor
is
very
subtle
and
laid
back
reminds
me
of
a
homebrew
with
a
bit
of
a
twang
and
slight
oxidation
note
of
cardboard
not
bad
but
not
good
either
no
real
fresh
malt
or
hops
evident
balanced
bitter
and
sweet
so
another
plus
for
being
on
style
mouthfeel
is
light
and
co2
is
appropriately
restrained
overall
a
boring
brown
drinkable
but
not
exciting
in
the
least
think
southern
pecan
without
the
pecans
beats
a
newcastle
though
it
pours
out
amber
but
there
is
no
head
to
speak
of
and
what
is
there
disappears
quickly
i
got
a
sniff
of
citrus
but
not
much
else
the
taste
is
nothing
special
but
it
does
drink
well
on
the
palate
medium
with
an
upfront
fizz
that
is
not
too
long
i
couldnt
taste
the
honey
anywhere
except
maybe
in
the
smell
a
rather
weak
attempt
at
a
drinkable
version
of
the
style
everything
just
seems
wan
and
uninteresting
to
the
point
of
serious
ennui
the
honey
is
a
nice
idea
but
barely
makes
a
dent
in
the
overall
impression
of
this
offering
if
you
see
this
particular
honey
giving
you
the
eye
check
yourself
and
simply
walk
away
truck
stop
honey
brown
ale
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
english
brown
ale
style
but
consumers
should
know
that
it
is
not
a
robust
brown
ale
if
that
is
what
you
want
then
you
should
look
elsewhere
for
this
beer
is
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
however
it
is
not
watery
and
has
enough
good
qualities
going
for
it
to
warrant
a
sample
it
is
much
like
other
back
40
beer
products
nothing
amazing
but
imminently
drinkable
and
with
enough
good
points
to
recommend
overall
its
definitely
a
light
easydrinking
brown
ale
im
down
for
that
but
anyone
looking
for
high
hopping
or
a
thicker
heavier
brown
might
do
best
to
look
elsewhere
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
graham
cracker
than
probably
any
other
beer
i
have
had
honey
is
not
as
apparent
on
the
flavor
and
finishes
drier
than
expected
with
a
little
bit
of
toast
and
a
decent
amount
of
hops
i
am
digging
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
would
like
to
see
as
well
and
the
malt
depth
could
use
a
boost
but
overall
i
think
this
is
a
fine
brown
ale
that
i
will
definitely
seek
out
again
next
time
i
am
in
alabama
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
good
english
brown
ale
though
this
one
could
fit
just
as
well
as
an
american
brown
me
thinks
both
back
forty
offerings
i
have
had
have
been
impressive
keep
up
the
good
work
overall
i
like
this
beer
maybe
its
because
of
my
local
pride
maybe
not
cheers
trying
the
truck
stop
honey
at
the
pie
factory
in
florance
al
the
beer
poured
a
clear
brownis
h
amber
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
scent
carries
hints
of
honey
the
taste
his
a
nice
combination
of
biscuit
and
honey
the
m
outhfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
o
tasty
and
not
overly
sweet
but
marred
but
an
inexplicably
harsh
feel
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
by
dating
on
bottle
poured
an
almost
tea
color
with
an
initial
onefinger
white
head
that
receded
into
a
thin
cap
thin
oily
lacing
was
present
nose
is
full
of
malty
bread
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
sweet
bready
flavor
and
some
pepper
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
less
than
medium
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
overall
one
of
bamas
best
offerings
is
one
of
my
gotos
if
you
enjoy
brown
ales
this
is
an
alabama
special
i
find
it
very
hard
to
believe
that
brown
by
good
people
is
so
highly
acclaimed
when
i
much
prefer
the
truck
stop
honey
brown
give
it
a
try
i
guarantee
youll
enjoy
its
tough
to
find
so
dont
hesitate
if
the
opportunity
presents
oa
good
brown
ale
definitely
the
best
one
brewed
in
alabama
try
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
found
this
previously
unknown
brown
ale
floating
in
the
mixed
six
section
at
a
winn
dixie
in
meridian
mississippi
this
was
a
medium
bodied
brown
with
a
balanced
flavor
and
slender
body
that
was
certainly
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
probably
get
much
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
the
honey
and
clove
in
the
nose
translate
well
into
the
taste
and
the
hops
are
just
noticeable
enough
to
give
it
some
character
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
thin
texture
a
distinctive
take
on
the
style
but
i
dont
drink
a
ton
of
brown
ales
myself
this
offering
pours
up
a
nice
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
not
much
retention
and
leaves
little
to
no
lacing
the
nose
is
pine
honey
and
biscuit
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
almost
watery
taste
is
pretty
watery
too
on
the
front
though
the
finish
is
respectable
i
honestly
expected
more
from
this
however
it
is
very
drinkable
if
perhaps
a
little
one
dimensional
o
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
here
although
id
categorize
it
as
an
english
version
i
could
see
this
being
my
goto
beer
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
recommended
o
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
brown
ale
this
tastes
more
like
a
weak
american
brown
the
honey
gives
it
a
rich
smooth
feel
but
i
wish
there
was
more
to
it
picked
up
a
sixer
from
the
piggy
wiggly
in
anniston
al
poured
into
a
tulip
good
brown
redish
color
with
decent
head
you
can
smell
light
hints
of
honey
and
malt
taste
pretty
darn
good
im
a
fan
of
brown
ales
and
i
think
brewing
this
one
with
honey
was
a
great
addition
the
carbonation
is
on
point
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
the
taste
of
honey
is
present
all
throughout
the
entire
experience
way
to
go
back
forty
an
overall
great
brewery
from
gadsen
al
overall
not
a
bad
brew
and
fairly
interesting
pours
more
of
very
dark
amber
than
brown
with
a
fairly
creamy
offwhite
head
that
fades
after
a
few
minutes
lightly
hoppy
in
the
nose
with
some
herbal
notes
a
touch
of
sour
graininess
and
a
a
very
very
light
roasty
note
end
with
a
bit
of
honeyed
sweetness
not
a
very
robust
brown
the
taste
is
similar
with
not
enough
body
or
roastiness
but
a
thin
slightly
sour
graininess
and
some
late
sweetness
substituting
for
those
flavors
a
slight
herbal
hoppiness
helps
things
a
bit
too
thin
too
sour
not
enough
bite
or
lacking
that
roastiness
even
some
honest
maltiness
would
be
welcome
here
fairly
pedestrian
overall
this
was
a
decent
enough
beer
although
its
not
something
i
would
seek
in
the
future
o
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
kind
of
boring
had
this
on
tap
recently
at
dram
whiskey
bar
in
mountain
brook
village
nice
brown
coppery
color
no
discernable
head
whatsoever
could
have
been
the
bartender
not
pouring
out
of
the
tap
correctly
notes
of
toffee
and
slightly
nutty
in
the
aroma
taste
was
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
tasted
a
slight
nuttiness
along
with
biscuity
malt
not
much
of
a
hope
presence
which
is
understandable
in
this
style
slightly
sweet
which
may
be
due
to
the
honey
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
as
a
good
sessionable
local
brew
beer
is
thin
and
mildly
sweet
with
a
toffee
like
finish
to
it
a
little
cidery
mildly
bitter
the
more
i
drink
the
second
was
better
than
the
first
the
third
was
the
same
as
the
second
overall
its
light
and
easy
drinking
nothing
to
see
here
though
an
average
brown
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
hints
of
roast
and
honey
low
hop
profile
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
mild
sweet
malt
slightly
watery
hints
of
earthy
hops
sweet
honey
faint
chocolate
note
light
toast
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
quite
nutty
creamy
but
light
texture
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
quite
sessionable
clean
tasting
beer
with
a
nutty
slight
roastiness
to
it
just
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
in
the
flavor
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
making
it
a
nicely
balanced
brown
ale
not
a
ton
of
unique
character
and
no
trace
of
honey
but
a
drinkable
brown
ale
that
could
be
sessionable
d
overall
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
the
flavor
is
good
and
it
goes
down
smooth
but
it
could
look
a
bit
better
and
i
would
prefer
if
it
werent
so
light
bodied
i
guess
this
is
being
brewed
by
lazy
magnolia
at
the
moment
so
perhaps
theyll
tweak
the
recipe
a
bit
ifwhen
they
end
up
brewing
in
bham
also
while
i
like
lms
beers
consistency
hasnt
exactly
been
one
of
their
hallmarks
fairly
easy
to
put
away
overall
tasty
not
too
sweet
or
filling
and
a
surprisingly
decent
rendition
of
a
brown
d
too
drinkable
a
well
crafted
beer
and
obviously
didnt
go
unnoticed
picking
up
silver
medal
at
great
american
beer
festival
this
past
year
welldeserved
not
all
that
complex
but
not
a
bad
brown
ale
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
overall
i
liked
the
brew
and
it
was
an
easy
brown
ale
to
drink
but
it
did
come
off
as
a
rather
average
brown
ale
to
me
d
i
would
drink
this
beer
a
lot
its
easy
sipping
interesting
drinking
and
goes
down
swell
would
buy
again
recommended
this
is
an
excellent
beer
from
a
very
small
brewery
the
added
honey
makes
a
unique
twist
that
is
characteristic
to
the
beer
it
is
hard
to
find
but
if
you
see
it
you
need
to
try
it
this
lightbodied
sweet
brown
ale
is
easy
to
drink
in
one
session
its
color
is
a
thin
brown
close
to
amber
the
smell
is
nonobtrusive
but
not
revealing
either
the
taste
is
light
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
brewed
with
local
wildflower
honey
so
its
good
for
my
allergies
im
glad
to
see
another
style
from
back
40
as
the
pale
ale
is
such
a
tough
category
to
start
in
i
have
enjoyed
this
6pack
enough
to
have
finished
it
in
two
days
congrats
to
back
40
its
a
nicely
balanced
beer
thats
not
complicated
but
still
interesting
enough
and
which
offers
enough
richness
to
leave
it
satisfying
without
becoming
too
much
given
the
price
1
17
single
bottle
its
hard
to
beat
as
an
occasional
semisweet
dark
ale
good
stuff
nice
full
flavor
brew
cant
go
wrong
with
a
beer
you
can
actually
taste
overall
a
relatively
simple
al
that
has
a
nice
roasted
flavor
easy
to
consume
dark
brown
with
relatively
small
head
caramely
malt
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
smooth
albeit
not
as
smooth
as
a
velvet
merlin
but
also
roasty
has
kind
of
a
rusty
quality
to
it
pleasant
but
id
opt
for
a
velvet
merlin
if
its
at
the
local
trader
joes
instead
for
an
extra
couple
of
dollars
per
sixpack
o
enjoyable
and
economical
dark
ale
that
straddles
the
brown
ale
light
porter
categories
improved
with
warming
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
kind
of
a
hybrid
between
an
english
brown
ale
and
an
english
porter
but
one
that
i
found
to
be
mostly
successful
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
overall
a
very
flavorful
beer
from
trader
joes
for
a
good
price
point
i
would
recommend
this
to
drinkers
who
like
malty
beers
good
brown
or
dark
ale
loved
the
malts
body
is
medium
and
its
pretty
darn
drinkable
no
real
complaints
but
its
also
not
going
to
make
front
page
it
plenty
drinkable
tho
overall
very
nice
brown
ale
would
have
again
a
good
brew
for
the
cold
months
but
also
would
work
on
warm
day
if
chilled
and
the
price
cant
be
beat
well
i
will
not
seek
this
out
thankful
for
the
bring
over
but
that
is
all
the
taste
is
generally
on
the
sweet
and
malty
side
but
it
does
not
go
overboard
nuts
malts
and
the
most
modest
of
a
hop
finale
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
the
style
poured
into
pint
glass
from
a
bottle
purchased
at
trader
joes
in
carmel
mountain
ca
amberish
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
retains
excellent
lacing
as
you
sip
on
the
brew
smells
like
toffee
caramel
pretty
swet
scent
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
the
nose
is
deceptive
was
expecting
a
sweeter
taste
but
this
is
very
balanced
earthy
and
malty
in
taste
first
time
trying
anything
from
black
toad
brewing
this
was
a
pleasent
brew
overall
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
beer
everything
about
it
is
incredibly
complex
especially
for
a
brown
ale
in
all
honesty
it
tastes
more
like
a
light
bodied
stout
than
a
brown
to
me
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
in
the
future
a
lot
more
the
dark
dried
fruit
flavors
in
black
toad
certainly
do
make
it
a
distinctive
dark
i
e
brown
ale
ill
be
revisiting
this
beer
soon
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
brown
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
the
flavors
are
good
but
not
bold
enough
to
really
make
a
statement
or
impression
of
any
kind
a
few
folks
around
here
seem
to
like
it
well
enough
give
her
a
try
and
see
what
you
think
i
thought
this
was
fine
a
step
above
newcastle
but
there
are
much
better
brown
ales
around
overall
drinkability
one
is
enough
for
me
i
could
not
drink
another
by
itself
with
food
maybe
another
one
per
evening
but
its
still
quite
sweet
might
make
a
very
interesting
base
for
a
vanilla
ice
cream
float
though
still
a
good
fullflavor
beer
just
make
sure
youre
ready
for
the
sweetness
when
you
pop
one
open
rjt
a
very
solid
brown
that
i
would
have
again
great
price
and
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
this
paired
exceptionally
well
with
a
carlos
toraño
reserva
decadéncia
cigar
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
nuttiness
seems
to
me
like
a
brown
ale
with
a
little
extra
char
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
outstanding
amazing
beer
for
the
price
i
think
i
paid
1
00
for
this
guy
at
trader
joes
sweet
nutty
flavor
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
some
very
subtle
toffee
notes
in
there
not
overly
complex
in
flavor
but
it
really
hits
the
spot
if
your
looking
for
a
slightly
sweet
smooth
dark
ale
the
verdict
good
rich
and
malty
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
trader
joes
josephsbrau
label
overall
drinkability
not
great
initially
but
this
is
actually
a
very
good
session
nothing
outstanding
but
the
feel
makes
it
enticing
surprisingly
good
taste
considering
the
price
head
appearance
and
smell
a
nice
regular
house
beer
to
have
if
you
are
on
a
budget
or
plan
on
drinking
quite
a
few
in
one
night
notes
its
not
goose
island
nut
brown
ale
but
it
is
easy
drinking
and
for
the
price
a
good
value
would
buy
again
not
knocking
my
socks
off
this
one
is
in
the
ok
zone
a
beautiful
brown
with
spectacular
redamber
highlights
reminiscent
of
a
late
night
sunset
poured
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
with
considerable
lacing
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
hidden
inside
the
amber
notes
float
a
moderate
amount
of
bubbles
aroma
screams
of
nutty
goodness
hints
of
chocolate
and
raisins
are
also
present
no
hops
make
an
appearance
flavor
is
malt
dominated
with
a
complexity
of
bitter
chocolate
toffee
dark
fruits
and
toasted
nuts
a
sweet
caramel
tone
lingers
along
with
a
very
slight
butterscotch
flavor
there
is
also
a
slight
roasted
bitterness
and
just
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
carbonation
leans
toward
the
low
side
combine
this
with
the
residual
sweetness
and
it
makes
for
a
medium
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
combination
of
flavors
this
is
one
of
the
cheap
beers
from
trader
joes
its
not
bad
at
all
for
not
much
more
than
1
a
bottle
very
malty
tastes
more
like
an
oktoberfest
than
a
brown
ale
more
chocolate
and
toast
than
anticipated
decidedly
sweet
but
fairly
flavorful
very
malt
dominant
given
the
relatively
low
abv
and
the
budget
pricepoint
this
is
proving
to
be
quite
the
autumn
session
ale
in
my
home
one
of
the
best
values
on
offer
from
trader
joes
definitely
inspired
by
a
number
of
northern
style
english
browns
this
beer
quietly
bests
a
number
of
them
poured
into
a
maudite
snifter
pours
a
dark
ruddy
brown
amber
with
a
one
finger
fine
medium
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
slippery
lacing
aroma
of
toasted
malt
brown
bread
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
of
toasted
and
biscuit
malt
butterscotch
and
mild
nuts
and
chocolate
finishes
with
light
sweet
toasted
malt
and
caramel
pretty
darn
good
for
a
cheap
low
abv
brown
ale
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
mild
flavors
but
i
like
it
o
i
have
to
round
this
one
up
a
bit
simply
for
the
fact
this
is
probably
the
best
budget
micro
ive
come
across
very
solid
malty
brown
ale
for
bmc
cost
well
done
the
body
was
typically
decent
for
the
style
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
stickysweet
finish
drinkability
was
good
as
brown
ales
usually
tend
to
be
overall
an
ok
beer
one
thats
worth
grabbing
a
sixer
of
as
a
budget
option
a
trader
joes
perennial
a
different
take
on
the
other
brown
ale
so
popularly
debased
by
newcastle
overall
this
beer
is
an
excellent
member
of
the
genre
its
a
touch
watery
in
the
flavor
otherwise
really
nice
beer
high
c
o
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
darker
and
more
malty
than
i
expected
i
grabbed
it
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
next
time
i
will
grab
a
full
six
pack
of
this
overall
this
is
a
beer
ive
purchased
a
few
times
over
the
years
and
i
wonder
why
i
dont
buy
it
more
often
probably
due
to
its
trader
joes
exclusivity
at
5
99
per
sixer
its
certainly
one
of
the
better
bargain
beers
to
be
had
pours
a
clear
crimson
brown
with
a
12
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
drip
back
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
burnt
carameltoffee
aromas
taste
is
of
roast
malt
bread
caramel
and
a
slightly
nutty
and
herbal
hop
finish
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
light
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
roasty
aromas
and
flavors
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
but
pretty
good
all
around
a
solid
a
try
it
or
buy
a
case
worth
for
your
next
party
food
pairing
id
pair
this
with
bacon
wrapped
steak
cubes
and
roasted
baby
red
potatoes
o
for
the
price
its
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
agreeable
and
inexpensive
brown
ale
by
way
of
trader
joes
o
a
real
good
beer
at
a
buck
a
bottle
actually
feels
bigger
than
5
3
which
is
a
boon
at
this
price
point
a
decent
english
brownporter
d
definitely
an
interesting
brown
ale
much
like
a
stout
in
flavor
o
just
a
hell
of
a
tasty
brown
ale
tastes
like
england
this
is
one
toad
i
could
lick
again
and
again
this
beer
was
surprisingly
enjoyable
it
had
been
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
so
i
decided
to
drink
it
it
pours
pretty
dark
the
slightest
light
is
able
to
get
through
a
very
dark
brown
smells
of
oats
and
dark
chocolate
the
first
thing
that
struck
about
the
taste
was
its
sweetness
and
relative
thickness
for
an
abv
of
about
5
i
was
not
expecting
big
flavors
this
is
a
good
brew
simple
no
frills
and
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
expecting
a
canned
mushroom
brown
ale
this
is
way
better
than
many
of
the
english
browns
that
i
have
tried
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
dark
brown
ale
it
pours
coffee
colored
with
a
nice
head
and
smells
like
coffee
and
chocolate
it
has
a
rich
malty
taste
that
tastes
a
lot
like
it
smells
it
has
a
deeper
coffee
bite
than
a
lot
of
browns
probably
because
its
so
dark
quite
a
nice
brown
ale
for
5
99
a
six
at
trader
joes
this
is
good
value
for
a
well
made
brown
ale
that
has
a
big
mouthfeel
and
a
good
long
finish
not
the
most
complex
of
brown
ales
this
still
works
well
with
a
big
malty
taste
and
a
little
on
the
sweetness
side
i
will
add
this
to
the
mission
st
pale
ale
and
ipa
as
my
fave
tjs
beers
poured
12oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
ok
i
will
not
do
my
typical
review
for
this
this
has
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
with
good
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sweet
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
the
same
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
good
carbonation
nice
body
overall
good
but
not
great
i
would
drink
this
again
but
again
its
a
bit
sweet
so
i
could
not
drink
this
often
clear
brown
with
a
coppery
hue
and
a
soapy
tan
cap
decent
head
retention
with
clumpy
lacing
brown
sugar
and
pearapple
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
a
little
bready
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
very
similar
flacour
profile
just
a
little
less
potent
low
grassy
bitterness
with
brown
sugar
and
fruit
bread
and
faint
dark
malt
creamy
texture
lightish
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
pretty
enjoyable
with
some
nice
english
character
i
have
never
given
this
beer
to
somebody
who
didnt
like
it
it
is
definitely
a
popular
beer
at
parties
and
for
the
price
its
hard
to
complain
definitely
a
buy
definitely
something
to
keep
in
stock
it
has
a
nice
brown
nut
ale
flavor
to
it
the
roasted
barley
is
great
my
fiance
got
this
for
me
from
trader
joes
i
need
her
to
get
me
some
more
overall
a
nice
dark
ale
presenting
and
showcasing
many
of
the
standard
flavors
of
the
style
but
doing
so
with
a
class
and
subtletyas
well
as
with
larger
flavorsthan
many
of
its
peers
a
very
surprising
beer
that
looks
heavier
than
it
is
and
is
actually
quite
light
and
drinkable
bordering
on
a
session
beer
for
malty
beer
fans
the
price
of
a
six
pack
makes
this
even
more
sessionable
so
thank
you
trader
joes
o
very
tasty
and
i
downed
this
pretty
quick
def
would
rec
a
sixer
overall
an
enjoyable
lighter
ale
good
for
the
summer
months
when
craving
a
darker
beer
but
want
something
less
heavy
than
a
stout
or
porter
very
enjoyable
beer
for
a
name
like
black
toad

is
at
trader
joes
another
excellent
brew
if
you
are
on
a
budget

pours
a
dark
brown
that
shows
some
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
light
the
beer
is
topped
by
an
offwhite
diminishing
head
the
aroma
has
some
dark
malt
characteristics
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
somewhat
well
balanced
however
theres
something
just
a
bit
off
dark
malts
and
chocolate
blend
well
with
some
light
citrus
hops
but
its
far
from
the
best
the
beer
is
light
and
mildly
carbonated
this
beer
is
drinkable
at
92
cents
a
bottle
from
trader
joes
but
id
rather
spend
the
extra
change
for
something
better
this
is
a
good
entrance
into
the
dark
ale
style
a
value
priced
ale
at
trader
joes
i
have
had
some
beer
from
trader
joes
that
would
take
varnish
off
a
bar
top
so
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
poured
almost
black
dark
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
nose
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
smooth
flavor
of
caramel
chocolate
and
toffee
a
little
nuts
in
the
finish
this
is
a
good
value
from
trader
joes
nice
brown
the
taste
first
hit
me
with
a
slight
nutty
malt
flavor
followed
by
barley
hops
chicory
and
some
coffee
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
refreshing
and
smooth
with
an
aftertaste
that
tried
its
best
to
stick
around
but
just
couldnt
get
the
job
done
carbonation
levels
were
lackluster
overall
it
wasnt
a
bad
buy
for
a
buck
at
trader
joes
its
not
a
standout
brew
by
any
means
but
its
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
d
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
an
absolutely
perfect
sessions
porterenough
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
but
easy
drinking
as
well
very
drinkable
recommend
you
pick
this
up
the
point
of
origin
suggests
to
me
that
its
brewed
by
goose
island
satisfying
surprisingly
complex
flavor
with
figs
or
maybe
prunes
mixing
with
the
base
coffee
tones
and
a
bit
of
smoked
meat
and
a
general
creaminess
mouthfeel
could
stand
thickening
but
certainly
doesnt
embarrass
itself
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
and
definitely
will
be
a
regular
when
i
make
pilgrimages
up
to
cary
for
organic
fruit
and
tofurky
md
not
very
drinkable
slightly
off
putting
taste
with
some
coffee
goodness
but
not
well
blended
or
balanced
weird
they
only
brew
one
beer
a
decent
brew
black
toad
lives
up
to
its
name
being
clearly
dark
ale
opaque
brown
to
black
with
a
light
brown
head
on
it
good
solid
roast
smell
in
the
nose
but
not
complex
and
not
much
else
to
go
with
it
it
losing
some
of
the
roast
the
taste
wo
adding
any
complexity
and
the
body
is
definately
watery
good
training
stout
if
someone
is
moving
into
the
style
for
the
first
time
nothing
wrong
with
drinking
one
but
this
will
be
my
last
drinkability
it
didnt
wow
me
but
i
enjoyed
the
hoppy
character
i
tuned
to
throw
the
bottle
away
and
the
head
was
gone
never
a
good
way
to
start
chocolate
and
bitter
hops
take
over
the
flavor
perhaps
ive
been
ruined
by
stouts
but
this
was
just
too
watery
but
saying
that
it
was
still
pleasant
and
a
good
candidate
for
a
session
beer
this
ale
pours
a
very
dark
near
stout
color
with
nice
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
and
is
nice
the
taste
is
solid
with
a
good
nuts
and
chocolate
quality
that
doesnt
finish
harshly
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
for
my
tastes
but
all
in
all
this
ale
drinks
well
and
i
enjoy
it
on
occasion
dark

poured
into
an

pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
nice
thick
offwhite
head
and
grainy
cocoalike
aroma
the
first
sip
is
smooth
with
some
light
roasted
malt
flavors
balanced
by
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
lightly
bitter
hops
the
bottle
may
say
dark
ale
but
this
beer
has
me
thinking
black
lager
instead
of
porter
as
it
is
very
clean
tasting
the
finish
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
pleasant
roasted
character
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
dark
beer
and
a
good
buy
fours
all
around
this
beer
to
me
was
very
consistent
the
coke
dark
color
and
creamy
but
thin
head
was
nice
smell
was
loaded
with
toasted
chocolate
with
a
little
coffee
as
well
taste
just
like
smell
medium
bodied
with
just
enough
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
strangely
this
is
a
fairly
filling
beer
given
the
aforementioned
watery
quality
but
neither
of
those
things
keeps
it
from
being
very
pleasing
this
feels
like
one
of
those
find
beers
something
i
would
have
never
guessed
to
be
as
good
as
it
is
at
a
great
trader
joes
price
still
not
sure
if
its
an
ale
or
a
porter
really
it
tasted
like
a
mix
of
the
two
but
it
couldnt
matter
less
at
this
point
hooray
for
contract
brewing
another
baragin
at
trader
joes
in
cambridge
at
5
29
a
six
the
quality
was
really
surprising
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
very
nice
creamy
head
smell
is
distinctly
malty
yet
there
was
a
definite
hop
note
taste
is
malty
with
a
smoky
quality
light
hop
notes
on
the
finish
smooth
and
easy
to
quaff
on
the
drinkability
scale
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
smooth
with
a
nice
creamy
quality
first
taste
didnt
sit
to
well
a
bit
acidic
and
a
bit
too
tart
second
sip
a
little
better
with
a
generic
dark
flavor
slightly
thick
and
coats
the
mouth
drinkable
but
boring
this
beer
was
rather
easy
drinking
and
quite
reasonably
priced
as
well
eric
this
dark
ale
looked
more
like
a
root
beer
maybe
a
little
darker
it
smelled
roasty
and
coffee
it
also
tasted
the
same
quite
nutty
and
plenty
of
coffee
present
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
for
a
porter
it
lacked
any
sort
of
wow
character
there
are
better
selections
that
i
would
make
if
i
came
across
this
again
apparently
its
cheap
which
is
good
it
would
be
cool
to
see
this
fill
the
same
niche
as
yuenglings
porter
which
is
better
in
the
empty
market
of
cheap
dark
beer
were
this
available
at
bars
priced
like
its
grocery
store
counterparts
it
would
be
excellent
for
putting
a
few
back
while
focusing
on
conversation
and
not
paying
attention
to
beer
as
is
its
pretty
lackluster
for
a
porter
maybe
should
be
reviewed
as
an
english
brown
ale
ala
abita
turbo
dog
especially
since
it
claims
to
be
a
dark
ale
might
fare
better
in
that
company
i
give
it
a
3
in
that
company
i
think
poured
into
a
clean
bar
glass
produced
a
thick
head
which
disappeared
almost
as
soon
as
the
bottle
was
set
down
nice
dark
colawithcoffee
color
enjoyed
the
smell
of
it
at
first
or
more
to
the
point
enjoyed
the
anticipation
of
drinking
it
overall
not
displeasing
to
the
nose
or
eye
now
for
the
mouths
opinion
one
good
sip
swirl
around
the
tongue
ehh
is
this
a
carbonated
batch
of
coffee
water
run
through
a
dirty
filter
a
second
time
with
beer
flavoring
added
plus
some
alcohol
thin
and
metallic
like
the
saliva
drained
out
from
the
bottom
of
a
trumpet
chilled
and
artificially
colored
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
not
improved
by
observing
the
noxious
black
amphibian
illustrated
on
the
label
however
not
to
be
dismissed
completely
it
is
scads
better
than
the
sea
dog
porter
or
trader
joes
winterfest
bock
reviewed
during
this
same
tasting
session
i
dont
think
ill
be
trying
this
one
again
much
prefer
trader
joes
black
hart
stout
for
a
dry
stout
and
tjs
stockyard
oatmeal
stout
for
a
desert
sweet
stout
all
of
these
three
are
at
the
same
price
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
malt
qualities
and
some
nice
hop
qualities
but
it
lacks
interest
some
qualities
of
a
bock
some
of
a
brown
ale
and
some
of
an
adjunct
lager
made
it
a
little
confusing
and
they
all
kind
of
washed
together
an
incredibly
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
dark
that
represents
well
enough
in
taste
to
forgive
the
lack
of
body
that
connesouers
of
porters
and
the
like
come
to
expect
but
then
again
thats
part
of
the
charm
right
poured
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
decent
head
initially
nose
is
of
roasted
malts
and
not
much
else
taste
starts
off
malty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
finishes
smoothly
mouthfeel
is
adequately
full
and
fresh
drinkability
is
ok
as
this
brew
is
definitely
better
than
your
average
macro
but
does
not
present
a
lot
of
complexity
to
be
a
top
notch
porter
got
this
at
trader
joes
just
to
try
didnt
have
super
high
hopes
but
i
liked
the
label
pours
brown
but
not
opaque
nice
head
great
long
lacing
smalls
yeasty
like
bread
also
some
malty
odor
taste
is
like
roasted
males
at
first
then
nutty
a
hint
of
molasses
and
caramel
and
a
rich
chocolate
aftertaste
tastes
a
bit
like
a
watered
down
stout
but
in
a
good
way
smooth
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
present
but
not
striking
slides
easily
down
the
throat
great
drinkability
this
is
a
session
beer
if
ive
ever
had
one
not
sure
if
i
would
call
this
a
porter
though
thats
not
the
exact
style
i
would
select
although
im
not
sure
exactly
what
i
would
call
it
if
i
was
reviewing
it
as
a
porter
it
would
get
lower
marks
i
think
definitely
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
craemy
and
nutty
palate
the
nuts
stay
with
the
tongue
the
longest
a
little
dry
as
well
another
trader
joes
associated
beer
that
is
offered
at
a
great
price
for
the
product
a
decent
offering
poured
out
to
a
medium
brown
black
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
medium
level
of
carbonation
lacing
was
minimal
not
much
of
a
smell
but
notes
of
roasted
malts
and
herbs
were
noted
taste
was
pretty
good
flavors
of
malts
light
coffee
and
some
nuts
seemed
to
go
together
quite
well
mouthfeel
was
good
as
the
carbonation
seemed
to
really
keep
the
palate
occupied
decent
drinkability
this
is
a
deal
at
4
99
a
sixer
at
trader
joes
for
that
price
this
beer
is
a
recommended
brew
another
budget
trader
joes
buy
pours
a
dark
coloralmost
black
with
a
slight
tannish
head
pretty
basic
porter
style
appearance
here
smells
of
roasted
malt
caramel
and
nut
pretty
full
and
pretty
well
balanced
tastes
rather
bland
for
a
porter
roasted
malt
is
notable
but
not
terribly
strong
hops
are
also
part
of
the
flavor
but
there
is
nothing
special
at
all
here
mouthfeel
is
not
great
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
but
no
real
substance
on
the
tongue
a
bit
fizzy
and
watery
very
surprising
for
the
style
overall
this
beer
isnt
great
and
it
isnt
too
bad
either
weak
for
my
tastes
average
is
probably
a
good
way
to
describe
it
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
due
to
the
weaker
flavor
especially
if
other
porters
tend
to
be
too
strong
for
you
general
quality
seems
okay
if
not
spectacular
nothing
is
skunky
or
really
off
just
not
really
tasty
when
compared
to
some
other
really
nice
porters
out
there
that
only
cost
2
more
a
6
pack
if
you
are
short
a
couple
bucks
this
will
do
in
a
pinch
otherwise
go
for
a
deschutes
black
butte
its
a
drinkable
ale
but
is
this
really
a
porter
toad
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
fairly
nice
thick
head
but
leaves
minimal
lacing
behind
very
nutty
and
roasty
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
consists
of
the
same
qualities
but
with
a
fairly
strong
bitter
finish
almost
like
a
brown
ale
or
a
esb
carbonation
level
is
adequate
but
overall
it
was
a
tad
to
bitter
for
me
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
coffee
and
chocolate
than
that
bitter
beer
face
this
one
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
very
frothy
tan
head
that
leaves
lots
of
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
very
faint
nutty
and
a
bit
earthy
the
taste
is
not
bad
slightly
bitter
and
slightly
malty
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
session
beer
that
could
be
sampled
several
times
it
is
pretty
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
it
is
drinkable
but
why
would
i
ever
want
another
one
of
these
blah
completely
forgettable
i
poured
out
the
last
quarter
of
my
glass
this
is
a
decent
stab
at
a
american
porter
it
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
good
brown
head
that
left
a
good
ammount
of
lace
on
my
glass
the
smell
was
kind
of
sweet
but
not
in
a
good
way
there
were
also
traces
of
chocolate
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
was
not
bad
at
all
with
a
good
hop
bitterness
to
go
along
with
the
semi
sweet
chocolate
flavor
and
roated
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
sturdy
and
this
beer
was
a
suprise
for
sure
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
a
couple
at
a
time
would
not
hurt
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
not
quite
as
dark
as
a
solid
stout
black
a
mediumsized
an
head
appears
and
then
just
as
quickly
vanishes
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
roasty
malty
almost
smoky
flavor
is
almost
amberale
like
malty
sweetish
easy
drinking
with
a
slight
hop
bite
at
the
back
of
the
throat
a
drinkable
brew
found
at
the
local
trader
joes
nothing
exciting
nothing
terrible
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
good
head
that
fades
at
an
average
rate
the
smell
is
chocalatey
and
very
malty
these
arent
bad
smells
but
they
seem
to
be
too
dominating
and
any
other
smells
that
might
be
there
are
lost
it
is
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
you
do
get
a
bit
of
that
chocolate
but
a
lot
of
the
malt
with
not
much
aftertaste
this
beer
feels
thicker
than
it
is
definitely
a
filling
beer
boring
dark
brown
clearish
black
body
and
nearly
no
head
yo
nose
is
wet
and
dank
with
some
piney
spruce
sharpness
that
reminded
me
of
wet
forest
tastes
are
burnt
and
roasty
seems
to
have
the
rudiments
of
the
porter
but
woefully
thin
body
and
garish
mineral
carbon
after
really
put
the
hurt
on
this
one
certainly
belowaverage
if
at
tjsavoid
this
got
another
bargin
from
trader
joes
84
cents
poured
ruby
with
a
small
off
light
tan
head
that
stay
around
along
time
with
some
good
lacing
aroma
malts
molasses
some
coffee
flavor
weak
malts
coffee
some
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
not
to
bad
for
the
price
will
buy
this
one
again
drinkability
was
okay
it
tasted
decent
and
smelled
fine
but
the
feel
was
just
not
quite
right
for
the
style
im
not
sure
what
style
this
beer
really
is
it
seemed
awfully
light
for
a
porter
though
it
might
work
as
an
entrylevel
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
darker
colored
beers
black
toad
will
certainly
disabuse
a
neophyte
of
the
notion
of
dark
beer
equals
heavy
beer
as
for
me
one
will
be
enough
thanks
overall
another
one
of
those
oddball
singles
from
trader
joes
that
was
a
nice
excursion
but
never
a
complete
detour
worth
a
try
for
the
money
and
an
interesting
change
of
pace
but
it
has
to
do
a
lot
to
get
me
to
pick
it
up
again
a
little
weird
all
told
i
dont
know
about
the
nutty
flavor
but
is
a
dark
chestnut
color
and
there
was
a
taste
of
roasted
malts
not
to
bad
but
i
would
not
purchase
this
ale
again
this
ale
had
a
nutty
bittersour
taste
and
that
was
the
turn
off
pours
a
thick
coarse
head
which
quickly
fades
into
a
lasting
15
in
rim
smells
faintly
like
opening
a
box
of
wheaties
or
some
other
multigrain
cold
cereal
taste
begins
with
smooth
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
ice
coffee
burnt
toast
rounds
out
the
finish
with
a
surprising
but
not
wholly
unpleasant
aftertaste
of
cigarettes
in
the
mouth
not
ashtrayey
but
approaching
that
no
bitterness
at
all
which
i
believe
might
strengthen
this
beers
profile
an
easy
drink
its
got
a
lighter
body
cf
guiness
stouts
than
most
porters
certainly
a
good
beer
but
theres
too
many
porters
in
the
english
or
american
style
that
surpass
black
toads
modest
presence
easy
to
drink
but
they
could
turn
down
the
carbonation
one
notch
i
wanted
to
like
black
toad
but
unlike
burnt
marshmallows
this
burnt
product
is
not
pallatable
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beverage
good
with
food

pack
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
ill
look
for
again
black
toad
a
dark
ale
not
too
bad
of
a
looking
beer
from
trader
joes
and
a
huge
step
up
from
the
first
one
i
sampled
brownishred
reddishbrown
with
an
off
white
head
without
much
staying
power
the
taste
was
actually
not
half
bad
strong
coffee
flavors
with
a
rolling
taste
of
molasses
at
the
end
and
it
did
have
a
nutty
flavor
as
well
particularly
as
it
warmed
up
not
bad
not
great
but
not
bad
another
77
cent
trader
joes
beer
this
one
actually
was
not
too
bad
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
an
ultrathin
light
beige
head
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
nutty
and
malty
flavor
is
malty
smooth
with
some
hops
and
a
nutty
finish
all
of
these
attributes
are
in
small
quantities
though
and
it
was
on
the
bland
side
overall
i
think
this
is
a
weak
attempt
at
a
schwarzbier
notes
a
solid
beer
to
be
had
and
at
4
99
a
six
pack
it
is
a
steal
perhaps
a
beginners
dark
beer
or
a
beer
geeks
session
brew
overall
a
fine
brown
ale
its
easy
to
drink
and
hits
the
taste
and
look
well
moderately
dark
brown
ale
pours
very
little
to
no
head
smell
is
of
smoke
and
malt
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
a
little
smokiness
maybe
a
little
fruit
mouth
feel
is
thin
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
an
above
average
brown
ale
enjoyable
i
havent
experienced
many
brown
ales
other
than
newcastle
brown
ale
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
different
deep
brown
in
the
glass
with
sweet
nutty
and
malty
aromas
taste
was
mostly
dominated
by
sweetness
with
malt
flavours
but
otherwise
a
little
bit
thin
mouthfeel
fine
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
have
many
reference
brown
ales
to
compare
it
to
id
drink
it
again
but
probably
wont
remember
it
in
a
month
i
think
that
sums
it
up
for
me
o
cant
say
i
was
expecting
much
from
this
one
but
it
actually
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
drinkable
brown
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
its
surprising
in
how
much
roasted
flavors
of
coffee
and
subtle
smoke
there
is
like
i
said
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
tasty
pours
to
a
generous
beige
head
and
patchy
lacing
deep
ruby
brown
color
aroma
is
english
toffee
nuts
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
caramel
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
nice
balancing
subtle

mouthfeel
is

and

overall
some
interesting
elements
but
walks
a
strange
thin
line
between
flavorful
and
flavorless
that
ultimately
makes
it
forgettable
the
secret
in
this
beer
is
the
wonderful
smell
and
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
good
moderately
high
carbonation
could
be
a
little
higher
this
is
my
second
lost
coast
beer
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
better
than
the
other
i
think
its
a
good
session
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
its
not
good
enough
to
be
satisfying
if
you
are
only
going
to
have
one
its
just
doesnt
have
enough
in
any
category
medium
body
near
medium
effervescence
with
just
the
right
amount
of
tangtingle
to
it
easy
to
drink
and
not
heavy
at
all
good
stuff
o
very
good
brown
ale
almost
as
good
as
averys
ellies
brown
ale
good
stuff
and
a
great
beer
when
you
consider
the
price
o
excellent
overall
aroma
and
flavor
one
of
my
go
to
brown
ales
easy
to
find
at
a
good
beer
store
and
very
consistent
quality
o
its
nice
and
malty
but
clean
not
oversweet
as
well
this
makes
a
good
seasonal
transition
beer
coming
out
of
those
strong
dark
winter
beers
and
hopping
right
on
pales
and
ipas
can
be
a
bit
shocking
this
brew
carries
you
gently
into
the
spring
o
refreshing
and
tasty
i
normally
dont
go
for
brown
ales
so
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
still
a
solid
beer
the
flavors
were
malty
with
strong
undertone
of
nuts
more
nutty
than
i
expected
but
not
harsh
or
overpowering
this
was
the
best
beer
of
the
day
and
i
immediately
sought
it
out
at
the
local
total
wine
for
home
consupmtion
following
then
the
taste
also
drew
me
into
much
warmer
climates
with
regards
to
both
body
and
seoul
with
hints
of
hops
which
are
unfortunately
lacking
in
many
of
the
korean
lagers
so
prevalent
in
these
parts
dark
but
not
heavy
downtown
brown
as
with
all
good
beers
was
able
to
transport
me
to
a
time
and
place
far
removed
from
my
current
set
of
local
circumstances
a
reliable
goto
back
home
in
killa
cali
and
now
for
some
blessed
trade
clause
here
in
south
korea
too
really
good
beer
great
aroma
and
flavor
mouthfeel
was
pretty
pretty
disappointing
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
its
simple
in
taste
and
smell
so
it
wont
win
any
awards
for
being
bold
dramatic
and
different
but
sometimes
you
just
want
to
drink
something
nice
and
easy
this
is
what
this
beer
provides
and
it
does
a
really
good
job
at
it
overall
a
good
brown
ale
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
great
it
lingers
on
for
a
good
three
minutes
its
dry
and
has
a
burnt
chocolate
flavor
to
it
for
as
cheap
as
this
beer
is
i
would
totally
buy
this
again
just
to
experience
that
aftertaste
the
brewmaster
made
this
beer
to
pair
well
with
food
i
can
totally
see
where
this
would
pair
well
with
pork
or
beef
well
done
ladies
overall
drinkability
not
the
best
brown
ale
but
its
pleasant
enough
overall
simple
tasting
brown
ale
but
its
still
good
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
brown
certainly
as
a
session
beer
in
fact
it
may
be
too
sweet
with
not
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
but
thats
alright
overall
a
very
good
above
average
brown
ale
i
would
actually
prefer
this
beer
over
newcastle
definitely
worth
picking
up
and
trying
one
of
my
favorites
cheers
overall
a
nicely
done
sweet
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
id
have
this
again
and
may
seek
it
out
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
sweeter
brew
is
a
good
sessionable
brown
that
i
am
enjoying
very
much
has
nice
flavor
and
is
a
good
brew
case
worthy
o
not
bad
but
a
bit
unremarkable
id
still
have
this
over
newkie
brown
any
day
o
a
decent
brew
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
but
it
certainly
didnt
offend
id
be
happy
if
i
were
served
this
again
although
its
not
one
ill
be
seeking
out
tasty
and
greatfeeling
nut
brown
ale
and
my
first
from
lost
coast
thanks
to
brian
for
letting
me
have
one
from
his
stash
as
this
is
one
of
his
favorite
session
ales
heard
a
lot
of
great
things
happy
to
have
finally
tried
it
i
poured
this
nice
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
magnificent
head
that
was
very
tan
looking
almost
brown
itself
the
beer
was
a
nice
mahogany
color
the
beer
also
produced
heavy
lacing
beer
smelled
slightly
nutty
but
was
not
really
all
that
fragrant
taste
was
warm
and
inviting
with
just
a
slight
sweet
finish
i
liked
it
and
would
buy
again
o
certainly
a
decent
beer
but
given
a
choice
of
english
brown
ales
i
would
opt
for
duclaws
euphoria
instead
doa
over
all
i
liked
it
way
more
then
the
first
time
i
would
get
it
again
no
doubt
i
think
it
could
be
a
little
more
crisp
but
what
the
hey
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lace
its
aroma
is
coffee
and
caramel
the
flavor
has
notes
of
roasted
malt
caramel
with
honey
and
a
hint
of
pepper
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
drinkable

with

is
also
full

some

different

tasty

easy

feels

in

and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
a
decent
to
good
brown
sessionable
at
the
very
least
its
a
shame
because
it
has
a
great
flavor
profile
but
its
watered
down
character
detracts
from
what
could
be
a
great
beer
o
smell
was
right
on
target
for
the
style
loses
points
in
flavor
for
lacking
solid
malt
structure
refreshing
enough
for
a
summer
cookout
single
finger

on
a
clear
brown
body
with
lots
of

is
mostly
sweet

is
more

with
a
stronger

smokey
presence
medium

overall
drinkable
and
unique
for
the
genre
o
kind
of
malty
no
flavors
that
stand
out
really
which
i
think
would
be
good
for
a
newbie
id
probably
drink
this
again
overall
a
tasty
brown
ale
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
o
not
a
bad
brown
ale
at
all
this
one
stands
just
above
average
for
me

some

taste
is
of

and
some

flavor
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
with
some
nice
toasty
and
nutty
flavors
going
on
o
decent
brown
this
one
lacks
the
depth
of
flavor
or
the
fullness
of
body
of
some
of
the
better
brown
ales
on
the
market
probably
my
favorite
brown
ale
right
now
notes
medium
in
body
and
has
a
soft
mouthfeel
flavors
are
wellbalanced
and
the
finish
is
clean
nothing
real
exciting
about
this
beer
but
nonetheless
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
in
numbers
its
definitely
a
session
brown
o
pretty
good
brown
ale
id
get
this
again
my
favorite
at
lost
coast
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
probably
more
enjoyable
in
the
summer
very
smooth
and
even
with
caramel
undertones
trying
the
down
town
brown
from
the
lost
coast
the
beer
has
a
good
appearance
poured
deep
clear
brownish
amber
with
creamy
thin
white
head
that
is
not
really
lacing
the
smeel
includes
deep
sweet
malts
the
taste
flowws
the
scent
sweet
malty
goodness
with
good
hop
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
and
certainly
recommend
it
o
the
beer
that
started
it
all
for
me
like
your
favorite
recliner
downtown
brown
can
show
you
a
good
time
regardless
of
the
situation
i
will
be
always
ready
to
head
downtown
i
again
have
to
fault
the
nose
for
making
this
beer
seem
less
than
it
is
because
it
really
does
taste
great
and
drink
very
easy
enjoy
overall
im
probably
going
to
keep
this
in
the
fridge
all
winter
long
its
sweet
probably
the
sweetest
brew
ive
had
but
i
like
that
solid
brown
ale
from
lost
coast
up
in
eureka
this
beer
pours
a
light
brown
and
smells
like
hazel
nut
with
other
sweet
aromas
and
taste
great
goes
down
smooth
with
not
too
much
bitterness
i
would
try
this
one
again
and
i
would
alsi
like
to
try
there
other
brews
but
the
taste
does
not
last
to
long
in
your
mouth
this
is
one
of
those
middleofthe
road
browns
hits
most
of
the
points
but
doesnt
really
wow
me
probably
will
pick
up
a
bottle
now
and
again
but
wont
make
a
fuss
if
it
becomes
unavailable
initially
i
catch
a
touch
of
smokiness
the
flavor
becomes
a
mild
dark
crystal
malt
with
a
lightly
sweet
touch
low
hop
that
comes
forward
during
the
swallowappropriate
for
the
style
thinnish
body
but
with
a
lower
carbonation
level
o
this
was
a
very
drinkable
brown
that
quenched
my
thirst
nicely
would
drink
again
overall
not
the
best
but
respectable
would
like
more
balance
to
the
beer
its
very
malt
forward
the
color
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
was
a
clear
medium
dark
brown
with
a
nominal
amount
of
tan
foam
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
was
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
caramel
with
a
touch
of
coffee
a
nicely
balance
ale
that
did
not
have
a
bitter
finish
pleasant
tasting
overall
a
bit
odd
dont
afree
with
the
molasses
in
the
smell
plenty
of
other
stuff
there
to
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
inconsistent
average
beer
that
could
be
better
o
if
youre
looking
for
a
pretty
good
brown
to
enjoy
while
watching
the
game
or
sitting
around
the
fire
pit
this
is
a
solid
option
picked
this
up
a
few
years
back
on
a
road
trip
with
my
dad
at
a
gas
station
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
in
northern
california
packs
more
flavors
and
complexity
than
many
brown
ales
ive
had
but
the
limp
mouthfeel
and
lackluster
appearance
leave
something
to
be
desired
however
i
could
see
this
making
for
an
excellent
session
beer
due
to
the
low
carbonation
and
great
taste
sweetness
is
helpin
me
with
yet
another
random

overall
this

is
no

very
quaffable
easy

enough
more

would
showcase
the

better

thats
probably
a

without
increasing

a

then
average
brown

pours
a
clear
distinct
brown
with
an
almost
non

head
and
zero
lacing
the
nose
is
of
your
basic
brown
ale
variety
but
with
a
bit
more
coffee
and
nutmeg
showing
up
the
taste
is
a
little
muddled
and
specific
flavors
are
hard
to
distinguish
however
it
is
very
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
as
there
are
no
badharsh
off
flavors
and
the
smoothnessread
light
carbonation
of
the
brew
is
excellent
o
if
it
was
a
little
more
on
the
creamy
vs
carbonated
side
i
would
really
love
this
beer
but
its
still
a
great
beer
o
highly
recommended
brew
for
beer
drinkers
of
all
tastes
d
i
feel
really
let
down
with
this
brew
nothing
else
to
note
really
decent
at
best
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
nutty
brown
coloring
that
is
semitranslucent
when
held
up
to
the
light
moderate
amount
of
bubble
action
in
the
glass
so
the
carbonation
appears
to
be
up
the
beer
started
with
a
shortstack
head
but
that
beat
feet
before
i
could
even
sit
down
with
the
beer
the
nose
is
caramel
and
nut
sweetness
but
not
overpowering
some
earthy
sweet
as
it
sits
for
a
bit
too
in
mouth
the
beer
is
a
nice
light
balance
for
the
flavors
the
brew
showcases
the
beer
is
toffee
and
nutty
sweetness
almost
like
eating
a
rolo
very
flavorful
and
does
a
decent
job
of
not
being
overpowering
with
all
the
sweet
characteristics
the
body
takes
on
a
creamy
texture
as
it
warms
while
still
remaining
light
in
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
all
nut
almost
like
a
little
nutella
only
liquid
form
the
finish
is
fairly
smooth
and
leaves
no
overbearing
trace
of
the
flavors
decent
beer
i
could
see
this
pairing
up
with
just
about
anything
but
especially
spicy
foods
where
the
sweetness
can
really
take
over
and
help
sooth
your
tastebuds
easy
to
down
too
if
your
in

kind

this
would
be
a
great

football
season
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
with
the
crisp
air
of
fall
and
some

would
be
fabulous
a
beer
that
you
could
enjoy

have

why
it

the

chocolate
flavors
i
expected
it
is
a
unique
brown

with

is
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
sticky

around

i
drink
the
beer

smell
is
sweet

with
hints
of
chocolate
and
dark

the
taste
is
a

sweeter
than
i
expcted

it
is
packed
with
roasted
malts
with
a

flavor
that
lingers
over

not
seemingly
missing
anything
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
this
beer
isnt
going
to
change
the
world
but
its
a
plenty
serviceable
warm
weather
brown
and
thats
all
good
in
my
book
smooth
great
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
overall
this
is
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
beers
sweetwater
offers
not
exactly
smooth
or
enjoyable
sweet
chocolate
comes
through
not
much
else
nothing
special
here
i
have
tried
brown
ales
every
chance
i
get
these
guys
make
the
absolute
best
i
have
ever
had
so
smooth
and
light
tasting
my
rating
2
80
why
cant
i
just
give
a
numeric
value
overall
a
really
good
english
brown
if
you
like
newcastle
you
will
love
this
beer
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
right
now
i
love
brown
ales
and
this
is
the
best
ive
had
i
buy
it
regularly
i
am
from
georgia
and
of
english
decent
so
im
basically
who
this
beer
was
made
for
plus
this
is
readily
avialible
in
my
area
thanks
sweetwater
it
really
looks
beautiful
in
a
glass
clear
ruby
red
and
brown
satisfying
from
the
first
taste
to
being
plastered
this
aint
sipping
ale
bulldog
in
jackson
ms
hefty
lacing
that
quickly
dissipated
smooth
with
hints
of
molasses
and
caramel
delicious
brown
ale
reminds
me
of
km
brown
can
i
get
some
more
one
of
the
better
sweetwater
beers
ive
had
pours
a
1
inch
head
smells
richly
of
malt
and
chocolate
sweet
tasting
chocolate
and
caramelish
flavors
really
stand
out
moderate
lacing
no
bitter
aftertaste
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
has
tried
other
browns
and
come
away
unsatisfied
will
definitely
be
buying
this
beer
again
smc
overall
decent
brown
ale
that
could
us
a
little
more
hops
andor
nuttiness
to
combat
the
sweet
malts
overall
wheres
the
toast
and
nut
comes
off
like
a
neutral
beer
which
is
even
more
surprising
for
a
brown
ale
o
this
actually
reminded
me
more
of
a
porter
but
nevertheless
it
was
enjoyable
and
certainly
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
overall
ok
nothing
too
special
but
a
decent
drinkable
brown
ale
that
slight
herbal
raw
molasses
flavor
and
corn
syrup
like
similar
aroma
are
the
real
things
that
detract
from
it
but
still
pretty
tasty
still
wish
there
were
a
bit
more
hops
and
bitterness
good
malt
character
english
hops
floral
notes
are
a
nice
change
though
the
fruity
malt
character
is
slightly
overdone
pint
with
supper
at
the
pirates
house
in
charleston
awesome
beer
dont
drink
it
cold
overall
a
nice
american
brown
good
to
the
style
and
full
of
flavor
ill
have
another
pint
when
i
find
myself
with
another
layover
in
atlanta
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
its
pretty
sweet
and
thin
and
it
goes
down
very
smooth
this
would
be
a
perfect
session
brew
not
my
favorite
from
sweetwater
but
nonetheless
this
is
a
very
good
brew
overall
an
average
brown
ale
highly
drinkable
non
craft
beer
enthusiats
would
love
this
very
accesible
flavor
profile
not
a
whole
lot
happening
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
would
buy
again
but
no
need
to
seek
this
out
or
anything
this
offering
from
sweetwater
pours
a
medium
mahogany
brown
with
about
a
one
finger
taupe
colored
head
and
not
a
whole
heap
of
lacing
smell
is
bread
nuts
and
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
pretty
satisfying
taste
is
pretty
mild
sweet
and
malty
upfront
followed
by
a
nutty
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
maybe
too
sweet
if
anything
not
a
bad
choice
for
our
last
night
in
atlanta
bringing
it
with
sweetwater
brewing
but
this
was
a
little
too
ordinary
of
a
brown
ale
overall
nice
degree
of
sweetness
nice
aroma
with
the
taste
less
complex
the
taste
just
falls
in
line
with
the
smell
the
dry
nutty
flavors
are
hidden
by
the
slick
and
sweet
malt
i
actually
really
like
the
flavors
although
its
not
overly
complex
its
a
simple
easy
to
drink
slightly
sweet
nut
brown
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
not
spectacular
by
any
means
but
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
o
fantastic
brown
ale
one
of
my
favorites
criminally
underrated
enjoyed
this
one
while
building
a
browning
m2
machine
gun
and
tripod
d
served
from
bottle
into
a
shaker
poured
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
nutty
and
cream
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
cream
and
nutty
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
i
was
really
quite
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
the
nice
roastiness
mixed
with
the
dark
chocolate
in
this
one
i
really
did
not
expect
it
to
be
there
the
aroma
was
pretty
much
the
same
story
with
a
nice
well
balanced
profile
going
on
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
or
are
lucky
enough
to
receive
this
one
as
an
extra
during
a
trade
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
mediocre
beer
and
a
pretty
average
english
brown
ale
there
were
no
off
flavors
but
it
didnt
have
enough
of
those
great
english
brown
ale
flavors
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
and
it
wasnt
filling
but
the
flavor
couldnt
hold
my
attention
so
one
is
all
i
would
want
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
the
slight
hazelnut
aspect
to
this
beer
they
were
the
highlight
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
the
light
body
and
the
lack
of
head
and
lacing
they
were
both
out
of
wack
and
need
some
work
to
make
this
beer
compete
with
some
of
the
better
english
brown
ales
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
i
would
get
this
beer
it
wasnt
a
memorable
english
brown
ale
and
i
dont
really
recommend
trying
this
beer
it
isnt
hard
to
find
some
better
english
brown
ale
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
it
just
felt
too
watery
and
the
flavors
were
a
little
bland
and
didnt
stick
out
like
they
should
i
am
starting
to
like
this
georgia
brewery
but
this
beer
failed
to
impress
me
better
luck
next
time
guys
i
know
you
can
do
better
growler
fill
at
gbx
poured
into
a
snifter
nice
solid
deep
brown
with
a
decent
1
finger
off
white
head
adequate
lacing
and
retention
smell
is
nice
roasted
malts
and
some
hints
of
nuts
and
a
touch
of
carmel
to
add
to
the
aroma
taste
follows
the
nose
and
mixes
malts
and
hops
quite
well
a
fairly
complex
eba
imo
sits
well
on
the
tongue
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
medium
feel
which
is
nice
a
creamy
overall
its
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
has
a
very
balanced
taste
with
some
sweet
and
some
bitter
a
soild
effort
by
sweetwater
and
i
would
hit
another
one
of
these
its
pretty
sessionable
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
not
bad
might
buy
again
when
i
visit
the
south
pours
to
a
thin
tan
head
and
brown
color
aroma
is
chocolate
malt
smoky
malt
and
earthy
hops
flavor
is
hershey
syrup
followed
by
mellow
hops
and
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
this
beer
is
easily
accessible
due
to
low
hop
bitterness
and
maltiness
mass
appeal
recommended
drink
a
nice
small
brown
ale
had
good
layers
of
flavors
and
overall
very
smooth
non
grainular
like
most
and
not
overly
malty
i
would
like
a
couple
bottles
of
this
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
its
flavorful
complex
drinkable
refreshing
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
and
an
easy
drinker
beer
has
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
is
well
bodied
overall
it
was
an
alright
beer
that
i
dont
think
i
would
put
in
to
my
personal
rotation
overall
a
pretty
straight
forward
brown
ale
bold
and
tasty
but
with
no
surprises
most
definitely
a
brew
you
could
drink
a
few
of
tastes
sweet
mildly
roasty
caramely
and
touch
of
chocolate
no
hops
at
all
for
balance
this
is
a
pretty
straightforward
american
brown
ale
no
surprises
in
the
flavor
but
no
flaws
either
not
as
much
in
the
nose
however
just
some
lightly
roasted
malt
more
aroma
wouldnt
hurt
medium
bodied
and
wellcarbonated
the
beers
color
is
on
the
border
between
light
brown
and
dark
amber
and
the
light
tan
head
settles
to
a
ring
a
few
small
patches
of
lace
are
left
on
the
glass
decent
but
not
amazing
thebeeralmanac
com
this
beer
has
a
unique
taste
that
i
have
never
experienced
in
a
brown
ale
or
any
other
beer
for
that
matter
there
is
a
sweet
sugary
taste
that
is
typical
of
brown
ales
however
there
is
also
a
fruity
and
maybe
somewhat
tangy
flavor
that
follows
this
sweetness
the
hop
profile
is
not
as
noticeable
though
it
may
be
there
and
just
covered
up
by
the
other
bold
flavors
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
i
would
recommend
at
least
trying
i
personally
like
it
though
i
feel
that
not
everyone
will
like
this
different
combination
compared
to
other
brown
ales
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
with
no
objectionable
qualities
these
beers
are
always
mild
and
wellbehaved
and
are
probably
not
what
most
beer
fans
reach
for
however
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
dont
pass
this
one
up
o
a
decent
to
good
brown
worth
a
try
ehh
i
could
probably
drink
it
again
but
really
not
my
type
o
excellent
for
style
o
a
nice
take
on
a
english
brown
ale
and
very
drinkable
i
could
see
this
being
very
enjoyable
on
a
cold
fall
night
i
quite
liked
this
brown
although
i
wish
it
had
had
a
slightly
fuller
body
on
it
but
thats
ok
with
me
light
mouthfeel
not
too
exciting
but
not
a
bad
brown
overall
pours
a
cloudy
amberbrown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
resilient
film
and
leaves
some
lace
aroma
of
wet
dog
roasted
malts
mud
rain
water
wet
grass
and
soggy
cereal
flavor
of
toasted
malts
nuts
root
beer
lots
of
earth
and
a
lingering
woodsy
note
lightmedium
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
a
wet
earthy
mouthfeel
bad
smell
on
a
brown
ale
this
one
is
off
d
highly
drinkable
relaxing
quality
brew
just
enough
body
without
being
too
heavy
o
thisns
a
year
rounder
for
sure
very
tasty
excellent
balance
o
liked
the
malt
character
and
overall
balance
o
good
brown
ale
that
falls
back
to
the
middle
of
the
pack
but
still
offers
good
flavor
im
not
usually
a
brown
ale
guy
much
less
an
english
brown
ale
guy
but
this
is
really
good
i
ordered
one
at
a
restaurant
on
tap
the
other
day
but
my
wife
was
in
a
hurry
so
i
didnt
really
get
a
chance
to
enjoy
it
but
i
vowed
to
pick
up
a
sixer
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
im
glad
i
did
dark
brown
with
a
big
khaki
head
did
i
just
write
khaki
lots
of
lace
and
stickiness
in
my
sierra
nevada
becker
darker
and
richer
than
many
bignamed
porters
like
bells
and
sierra
nevada
delicious
caramel
aroma
and
taste
not
too
thin
on
the
palate
again
better
than
a
lot
of
porters
not
a
lot
of
hops
but
after
all
it
is
an
english
brown
ale
i
really
liked
it
and
it
was
very
fresh
consume
by
072011
a
great
rich
malty
brown
ale
that
is
better
than
many
porters
i
see
a
lot
of
these
in
my
future
when
i
dont
want
a
lot
of
hops
not
bad
more
fruity
similar
to
their
porter
d
very
good
i
could
have
numerous
of
this
beer
as
a
matter
of
fact
anytime
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
georgia
brown
it
is
the
flavor
on
this
one
is
solid
but
not
too
special
that
said
this
is
a
good
very
drinkable
brown
alei
would
be
happy
to
stick
with
this
for
a
few
pints
and
it
wouldnt
fatigue
the
palate
o
it
is
an
above
average
brown
ale
i
tend
to
prefer
more
malt
and
toasted
flavors
than
the
fruity
esters
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
quality
beer
for
those
that
tend
to
the
fruitier
side
smells
malty
with
a
little
nose
hoppiness
pours
thin
and
brown
with
a
light
tannish
head
notes
of
nuts
and
roast
in
the
malts
slightly
hoppier
finish
than
a
typical
brown
as
is
typical
with
most
sweetwater
products
i
dont
enjoy
the
hops
in
this
brew
they
just
dont
balance
this
brew
out
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
american
brown
i
tried
bells
brown
today
as
well
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
one
is
a
little
easier
drinkin
i
can
definitely
appreciate
the
balance
and
think
that
this
would
make
a
pretty
good
regular
session
beer
if
i
lived
in
the
area
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
and
would
recommend
that
you
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
your
brown
ales
more
on
the
malty
side
like
i
do
a
nice
brown
that
i
liked
well
enough
to
order
a
few
times
during
my
trip
to
ga
refreshing
and
tasty
overall
probably
the
sweetest
brown
ive
ever
had
i
could
see
this
being
a
decent
english
brown
if
they
balanced
it
a
bit
more
but
as
it
is
it
is
way
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
the
malt
flavors
are
good
though
and
would
make
this
a
good
sessionable
brew
if
they
scaled
it
back
a
bit
cheers
d
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
sweet
beers
but
this
was
pretty
drinkable
smooth
and
quite
refreshing
not
my
style
i
wont
buy
it
but
id
drink
another
one
from
the
fridge
with
a
nice
beef
brisket
d
fairly
heavy
on
the
palate
id
get
again
if
i
could
find
it
the
beer
was
a
brownish
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
left
some
good
lacing
on
the
glass
i
could
smell
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
and
toasted
bread
when
i
took
a
sip
i
first
tasted
the
sweet
malt
just
like
it
smells
toasty
bready
with
hints
of
sweet
fig
it
has
a
medium
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
just
a
little
too
sweet
but
still
a
worthy
drink
d
pretty
good
beer
here
i
had
it
with
a
lamb
shank
and
it
seemed
to
pair
pretty
well
i
enjoyed
it
however
i
think
i
would
go
with
something
else
by
sweetwater
next
time
d
easy
to
drink
interesting
but
a
little
on
the
biscuity
side
for
my
taste
overall
really
very
well
done
and
i
would
have
no
trouble
at
all
with
polishing
off
a
couple
of
these
d
one
of
the
worst
brown
ales
ive
ever
tasted
thats
a
shame
but
i
had
liked
every
sweetwater
brew
i
had
ever
tried
up
to
that
point
d
nicely
drinkable
and
entrylevel
like
most
brown
ales
nicely
sessionable
this
beer
is
a
fairly
clear
mahogany
brown
with
umber
shadows
the
head
isnt
shy
about
leaving
sticky
bubbles
everywhere
the
aroma
is
simple
but
in
a
beer
like
this
that
is
just
fine
its
nicely
balanced
with
an
earthy
nuttiness
and
spicy
hops
on
the
back
the
flavor
is
just
about
the
same
a
nice
even
nuttiness
lays
an
earthy
base
under
a
spicy
hopping
dashes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
are
interspersed
d
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
smooth
sweet
brown
ale
this
is
a
good
option
very
drinkable
mellow
and
refreshing
overall
not
something
id
purposefully
purchase
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
this
is
a
plenty
tasty
easydrinking
brown
ale
not
too
shabby
maybe
this
would
fare
better
as
an
american
brown
ale
docked
a
bit
for
style
verdict
straight
up
the
best
sweetwater
product
i
have
tried
so
far
it
is
plentiful
with
flavor
and
both
tastes
and
feels
great
any
improvements
to
this
beer
would
need
to
be
in
the
appearance
factor
or
the
smell
to
bring
it
up
to
the
level
of
the
superb
taste
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
regardless
of
the
beer
types
they
enjoy
great
flavor
balance
its
all
around

very
good

a

beer
simple

very

helps
this
beer
very
drinkable
d
overall
sweetwater
georgia
brown
is
a
solid
brown
ale
that
is
worth
a
try
d
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
has
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
if
you
like
browns
and
can
get
it
im
afraid
it
is
hard
for
me
to
be
more
evocative
about
this
beer
than
to
simply
say
it
was
average
moderate
malt
with
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
although
little
hopping
is
expected
for
the
style
what
there
was
seemed
watered
down
mouthfeel
was
midrange
with
a
little
sugaryness
drinkablity
probably
not
something
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
a
nice
but
run
of
the
mill
brown
d
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
gotten
in
the
club
this
was
an
above
average
brown
ale
lots
of
caramel
and
toasted
malts
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
very
easy
to
drink
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
would
have
again
the
last
time
i
had
georgia
brown
was
at
the
sweetwater
brewery
2
years
ago
so
i
did
not
remember
much
the
pour
yields
a
transparent
watered
down
coffee
look
with
minimal
head
that
dissapates
quickly
aroma
and
taste
are
up
front
nutty
and
malt
forward
with
minimal
hop
presence
nothing
out
of
this
world
goes
down
smooth
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
quite
high
and
would
be
easy
to
drink
quite
a
few
not
as
good
as
big
boss
bad
penny
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
overall
impression
could
use
a
tweak
or
two
but
goes
down
just
fine
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
bunch
of
sweet
malt
notes
with
chocolate
and
caramel
cafe
mocha
sweet
cream
toasted
pecans
earthy
hops
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
upfront
along
with
caramel
and
toffee
toasted
pecans
honey
wheat
bread
and
some
earthy
hops
to
keep
things
in
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
really
easy
drinking
brown
ale
that
has
enough
going
on
to
keep
you
interested
perfect
fall
beer
you
can
prob
drink
these
all
night
long
with
little
abv
drinkability
3
a
night
one
night
a
month
overall
this
is
in
need
of
fleshing
out
but
you
could
do
worse
and
the
brewing
process
seems
spot
on
notes
definitely
not
the
best
sw
offering
or
brown
ale
but
this
is
sessionable
glad
i
tried
it
nice
medium
brown
color
with
frothy
light
tan
head
and
good
carbonation
light
nutty
aroma
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
exactly
what
a
good
sessionable
brown
ale
should
be
smooth
and
drinkable
my
thanks
to
glid02
for
this
one
d
very
drinkable
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
a
modest
abv
making
it
a
pretty
sessionable
brown
ale
mild
and
easydrinking
this
is
quite
the
quaffer
a
great
example
of
the
style
plain
and
simple
though
best
served
at
cellar
temperature
to
bring
out
its
best
and
truest
qualities
i
must
say
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
from
sweetwater
maybe
it
was
produced
to
have
a
beer
in
the
style
in
order
to
meet
demand
but
it
doesnt
go
as
far
out
as
some
of
the
other
sweetwater
beers
the
head
quickly
dissipates
from
thin
to
void
unless
you
put
on
a
heavy
pour
the
off
white
head
provides
the
caramel
to
the
nose
but
not
the
hops
this
easy
drinking
beer
seems
to
be
built
for
sixpack
drinking
rather
than
some
thing
as
extreme
as
dank
tank
still
good
enough
for
me
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
and
flavor
but
it
is
just
very
muted
looks
good
smells
good
and
tastes
good
but
leaves
me
wanting
a
little
more
d
overall
too
onedimensional
to
be
a
great
beer
with
the
dominating
roastiness
and
no
malt
to
round
it
out
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
watereddown
stout
than
an
authentic
english
brown
i
appreciate
the
attempt
at
a
style
that
is
not
copied
much
commercially
in
the
states
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
this
beer
is
another
point
in
sweetwaters
favor
well
done
guys
over
all
this
is
good
brown
ale
but
i
wonder
if
this
six
pack
was
a
little
old
i
believe
fresh
this
would
be
amazing
the
mouth
feel
is
not
too
thin
or
heavy
bottle
into
pint
glass
sampled
22710
pours
a
solid
brown
color
with
a
small
creamy
head
that
falls
fast
nose
is
heavy
with
molasses
and
caramel
and
a
hint
of
a
toast
in
the
mix
there
is
very
little
hint
of
hops
both
in
the
nose
and
the
flavor
a
smooth
drink
it
tended
to
the
sweet
side
but
was
overall
rather
pleasant
a
decent
session
beer
but
you
might
find
yourself
reaching
for
something
with
a
little
more
bite
to
complement
the
sweetness
of
this
one
thanks
to
my
friends
who
brought
this
back
from
atlanta
its
a
simple
brown
with
toasty
dark
bread
crust
and
hint
of
toffee
its
a
touch
sour
but
the
label
says
its
good
for
another
month
so
it
might
just
be
a
little
black
grain
worth
a
try
if
you
dig
brown
ales
excellent
brew
the
appearance
was
like
the
bsp
from
sweetwater
it
has
a
nice
lace
that
definetly
sticks
to
the
glass
the
whole
way
down
the
smell
is
of
malts
and
full
of
hops
the
taste
wow
i
was
not
expected
the
sweet
caramel
taste
but
man
it
is
good
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
very
nice
which
makes
for
a
great
drinkability
goes
down
so
smooth
i
think
this
definetly
worth
having
the
wonderful
state
of
georgia
in
its
name
i
advise
you
to
try
any
of
the
sweetwater
brews
beings
that
i
have
not
found
one
that
is
bad
yet
d
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
has
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
if
you
like
browns
and
can
get
it
overall
a
decent
beer
and
about
what
youd
expect
to
get
in
these
botm
clubs
got
as
a
gift
not
a
purchase
safe
middle
of
the
road
to
appeal
to
the
masses
and
not
push
any
boundaries
recommend
if
you
can
get
one
from
a
friends
fridge
rotation
not
available
here
in
tx
if
here
wouldnt
make
the
rotation
nn
bye
drinkability
i
thought
these
were
pretty
good
to
drink
the
flavors
of
anything
special
really
didnt
blow
me
away
but
thats
okay
id
pick
one
up
again
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
the
second
bottle
of
this
beer
was
better
when
i
just
drank
it
from
the
bottle
and
didnt
sip
and
savor
it
as
in
the
review
style
its
just
one
of
those
beers
thats
just
better
to
drink
than
analyze
the
taste
and
smell
di
think
this
is
a
pretty
solid
english
brown
ale
i
really
like
the
aroma
and
taste
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
during
a
hot
summer
bbq
of
indonesian
pork
satay
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
however
it
didnt
leave
a
lasting
impression
mouthfeel
is
decent
enough
lighttomedium
bodied
doesnt
just
lay
there
this
was
a
weird
one
for
me
started
off
well
enough
but
i
dont
understand
the
transformation
in
the
smell
the
taste
was
not
blowing
me
out
of
the
water
anyway
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
id
be
happy
to
edit
my
review
in
the
future
if
i
find
this
was
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
with
this
beer
i
figured
i
have
been
in
atlanta
long
enough
that
i
should
give
this
beer
a
try
and
it
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
really
a
plain
old
no
frills
brown
ale
thats
a
little
shallow
maltwise
but
is
a
nice
smoothdrinking
beer
that
goes
down
easy
d
good
session
beer
if
you
are
looking
to
drink
without
really
paying
much
attention
to
the
flavor
wont
wow
you
or
disgust
you
i
got
this
as
part
of
my
botmc
paleclear
brown
in
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
slight
lacing
there
is
a
breadiness
on
the
nose
maybe
some
damp
hay
the
beer
is
light
and
sweet
the
beer
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitter
hop
very
slight
the
beer
is
on
the
thin
side
a
very
easy
drinking
non
descript
brew
cheers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
this
is
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
with
a
good
flavor
that
would
be
even
better
if
there
was
more
substance
to
the
body
not
bad
drinkability
is
okay
its
a
generic
american
brown
ale
good
enough
but
forgettable
notes
while
this
isnt
as
good
as
an
actual
english
english
brown
ale
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
recreation
it
stays
true
to
the
style
of
mild
earthy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
than
some
light
english
style
browns
but
it
makes
this
beer
better
pours
a
clear
amber
color
13
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
pale
hops
slight
citrus
and
slight
yeast
fits
the
style
of
an
englsih
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
hops
pale
hops
and
slight
citrus
overall
a
good
body
blend
a
little
more
like
an
americna
brown
ale
but
still
good
overall
a
decent
beer
glad
i
tried
it
but
will
not
cry
if
i
dont
try
it
again
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
twofinger
thick
head
very
enjoyable
balanced
brew
i
dont
have
too
much
to
say
its
simply
a
pretty
good
beer
it
doesnt
take
many
risks
but
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
wrong
either
simply
a
wellrounded
ale
if
this
on
tap
at
a
restaurant
itll
probably
be
my
goto
d
nice
easy
flavor
with
just
enough
kick
sweet
roasty
and
balanced
drinkable
but
for
a
brown
ale
not
up
to
expectations
pretty
easy
to
drink
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
doubt
id
have
another
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
not
flat
but
not
carbonated
although
there
is
effervescence
bubbles
present
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
nil
this
beer
is
different
there
are
grassystraw
note
in
the
beer
that
give
the
beer
some
harness
to
it
i
really
cant
explain
it
d
i
really
like
the
flavors
but
i
cant
help
feeling
that
they
went
a
little
halfassed
with
this
one
what
im
smelling
and
tasting
is
excellent
i
just
wish
i
could
smell
and
taste
more
of
those
aspects
but
this
is
intended
to
me
a
mild
brew
based
on
the
style
so
i
really
cant
fault
it
for
that
this
is
a
tasty
but
underpowered
a
decent
session
choice
though
the
feel
is
creamy
and
substantial
but
not
thick
minor
fizz
but
smooth
too
a
good
beer
overall
easy
to
slug
down
but
not
wimpy
its
a
complex
malty
concoction
i
had
this
beer
before
bedtime
last
night
and
im
surprised
it
didnt
give
me
nightmares
this
beer
was
just
plain
awful
it
had
a
freshness
date
of
52209
so
it
wasnt
out
of
date
but
there
wasnt
very
much
good
about
this
beer
smell
taste
mouthful
and
drinkability
were
way
under
par
for
what
i
believe
a
sweetwater
brew
should
offer
i
really
felt
i
was
sniffing
the
glass
of
a
macro
and
mouthful
i
found
to
be
very
thin
and
unappetizing
i
will
definitely
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
d
id
say
this
was
drinkable
but
it
lacked
any
depth
and
i
really
wanted
more
from
it
i
didnt
find
this
offering
unpleasant
nor
pleasant
not
my
favorite
brown
but
it
is
still
drinkable
and
worth
at
least
one
try
poured
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
small
modest
head
frothy
in
texture
and
the
lace
adequate
to
coat
the
glass

mostly
malt
sweet

pleasant
enough
start
is
ambrosial
nicely
malted
and
the
top
middling

is
stinging
in
its
acidic
bite
the
hops
moderate
in
presence
and
bite
dry
lingering
aftertaste
overall
very
solid
drinking
and
i
would
not
have
trouble
taking
a
few
of
these
down
as
part
of
a
session
decent
solid
but
not
a
brainbuster
pick
it
up
if
convenient
it
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
heavy
malt
taste
with
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
middle
before
a
slight

a
tasty
english
brown
ale
on
tap
at
pub
71
atlanta
ga
brown
in
appearance
with
a
slight
white
head
that
was
not
well
retained
it
had
a
very
light
roasted
malt
aroma
to
it
but
again
very
weak
the
taste
pretty
well
followed
the
nose
a
light
roasted
malt
flavor
pretty
simple
and
not
much
flavor
to
it
it
had
a
light
body
to
it
seemed
almost
a
little
watered
down
still
if
you
can
get
past
that
the
beer
was
smooth
and
about
average
drinkability
i
probably
will
not
order
again
and
this
beer
does
not
appear
to
do
the
style
justice
lets
see
it
definitely
has
what
i
would
expect
for
the
style
english
brown
ale
which
involves
a
bit
more
hoppiness
and
not
too
much
emphasis
on
malt
it
could
almost
pass
for
a
barleywine
as
well
i
conclude
that
its
drinkable
and
one
could
enjoy
quite
a
few
in
a
sitting
without
having
to
turn
it
in
for
the
night
drinkability
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
some
fresh
cut
garlic
fries
this
is
my
first
beer
from
sweetwater
and
im
not
overly
impressed
hopefully
the
next
one
will
be
better
the
drinkability
of
sweetwaters
georgia
brown
in
my
opinion
is
somewhat
low
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
to
it
for
a
brown
ale
and
a
bit
more
of
an
emphasis
on
the
faint
roasted
flavors
in
the
beer
could
have
made
this
offering
a
real
winner
the
crafting
of
georgia
brown
is
just
too
loose
and
light
in
nature
to
really
impress
as
a
top
notch
brown
ale
drinkability
not
good
this
was
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
hope
to
come
across
this
one
again
as
i
had
3
bottles
from
the
microbrew
beer
of
the
month
club
i
will
try
more
brown
ales
because
i
liked
this
so
much
notes
a
successful
brown
ale
i
recommend
it
fairly
clear
amber
brown
beer
with
a
one
finger
cap
of
offwhite
bubbles
that
quickly
settled
to
a
collar
just
a
bit
of
lacing
caramel
and
brown
sugar
aroma
nutty
with
some
butterscotch
same
in
the
flavour
bitterness
was
present
but
restrained
bread
crust
and
mild
fruity
notes
definitely
balanced
towards
malt
with
hop
flavour
just
out
of
focus
medium
to
light
bodied
average
carbonation
fairly
smooth
quite
drinkable
and
easy
on
the
palate
im
a
fan
of
this
one
very
nice
brown
ale
drinkability
is
good
on
this
brew
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
big
bowl
of
cheddar
soup
wish
i
had
a
few
more
for
the
rest
of
the
day
md
very
thin
almost
water
mouthfeel
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
which
knocks
the
drinkability
down
a
step
not
a
horrible
beer
but
nothing
great
either
the
weakest
offering
i
have
sampled
from
sweetwater
d
this
is
a
pretty
average
english
brown
and
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
personal
tastes
for
a
sessionable
beer
d
very
high
drinkability
with
the
moderate
alcohol
and
balanced
taste
another
sample
poured
by
the
busty
black
girl
at
the
juke
joint
in
that
atlanta
airport
off
the
tap
this
beer
displayed
a
mediocre
tan
head
of
midsize
bubbles
and
a
copper
colored
liquid
leaning
towards
the
red
side
it
laced
like
a
jigsaw
puzzle
all
the
way
down
my
glass
too
no
visible
carbonation
rising
in
the
beer
as
for
the
aroma
where
is
the
aroma
musty
malt
and
faint
grains
too
subtle
in
my
opinion
malts
are
the
most
distinct
flavors
in
the
beer
with
a
bready
quality
in
particular
some
nuttiness
and
again
that
horsesaddle
mustiness
a
farmhouse
style
flavor
palate
feisty
carbonation
neutralized
some
of
the
flavors
not
as
deep
as
it
could
be
for
a
brown
but
above
average
for
an
airport
beer
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
one
id
seek
when
i
head
down
south
thi
i
would
weakly
recommend
this
beer
i
got
this
bottle
from
the
microbrew
of
the
month
club
folks
this
has
elements
of
a
porter
but
overall
it
is
a
crystal
malt
tasting
beer
there
is
balancing
hop
in
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
good
rich
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
tasty
brown
deep
leather
brown
some
have
suggested
chestnut
color
in
the
glass
slight
haze
small
head
that
disappeared
quickly
malty
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
something
hops
that
when
tasted
leaves
a
veggie
caramel
nutty
aftertaste
nothing
bad
just
difficult
to
classify
carbonation
is
mild
with
decent
mouthfeel
all
in
all
a
decent
brown
but
the
more
you
sip
the
more
you
wonder
what
youre
tasting
probably
better
on
tap
for
a
hot
muggy
day
in
the
southeast
this
could
be
good
nice
light
malty
flavor
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
exciting
here
but
very
quaffable
easy
drinking
brown
ale
due
to
the
lightness
of
the
brew
its
okay
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
drinkability
is
moderate
low
alcohol
makes
this
brew
easy
to
consume
but
flavor
is
lacking
and
uninspiring
d
it
would
be
more
drinkable
if
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
improved
but
this
is
still
a
decent
brown
ale
the
flavor
has
some
real
potential
it
just
needs
to
be
allowed
to
develop
better
without
all
the
carbonation
still
a
good
beer
that
would
make
a
nice
casual
session
d
a
good
brown
ale
no
doubt
i
prefer
rogue
hazelnut
brown
nectar
over
this
but
it
is
something
i
would
buy
again
d
the
best
beer
by
sweetwater
in
my
opinion
good
brew
for
a
southern
brewery
and
worthy
of
a
try
another
soso
brew
from
sweetwater
terrapin
is
passing
sweetwater
pretty
quickly
in
my
opinion
anyway
onto
the
review
pours
a
murky
brown
without
a
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
sweet
smell
cant
pick
anything
out
of
it
though
taste
is
mediocre
at
best
a
watery
sweetish
mixture
that
doesnt
deliver
overall
a
watered
down
brew
that
is
pretty
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
or
brew
beer
pours
a
very
a
nice
chestnut
color
topped
off
by
a
decent
head
that
left
a
trail
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
some
nuttiness
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
again
malty
and
nutty
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
the
flavor
comes
across
as
a
tad
weak
but
not
too
bad
smooth
and
medium
bodied
one
could
easily
stick
with
this
beer
for
the
entire
night
thanks
to
maria
for
picking
this
up
for
me
during
her
travels
drinks
fairly
easy
a
decent
not
great
brown
ale
was
looking
for
roastyness
or
some
nuttyness
i
could
put
2
or
3
down
before
boredom
set
in
12
oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
brown
color
mine
had
a
pretty
good
size
offwhite
head
on
it
but
didnt
leave
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
little
nuttiness
in
there
also
the
taste
is
also
pretty
decent
malty
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
very
drinkable
another
good
beer
from
these
guys
d
not
particularly
interesting
but
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
plenty
of
malt
but
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
is
fairly
bitter
as
well
if
there
are
any
flaws
here
they
would
be
a
slight
harshness
to
the
bitterness
and
flatness
to
the
hop
aroma
but
neither
are
a
big
deal
in
a
brown
ale
ontap
at
the
brewpub
another
sweet
brown
beer
clearly
a
malt
play
carameland
on
the
sweet
side
even
a
bit
thin
though
sitable
carbonation
some
soapy
head
and
lacing
was
nice
kind
of
a
root
beer
with
licorice
unnnecessary
as
the
blue
gives
all
the
sweet
beer
drinkers
their
fill
overall
my
first
sweetwather
brew
and
it
is
pretty
drinkable
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
was
rather
enjoyable
if
i
ever
saw
it
on
tap
i
would
order
it
without
any
reservations
ok
what
to
say
this
beer
pours
a
fading
copper
brown
with
minimal
head
there
is
some
lacing
and
the
beer
appears
to
be
a
little
high
on
the
carbonation
appearance
is
alright
nose
not
alot
here
a
little
buttery
toffee
nuts
and
malt
on
the
nose
but
barely
detectable
which
could
be
a
sign
of
conservatismhappens
alot
with
this
style
taste
yep
not
alot
going
on
here
like
the
nose
a
little
butter
toffee
a
little
sweet
roasty
maltedness
unfortunately
it
all
leaves
like
a
leer
jet
and
zero
aftertaste
and
not
so
high
on
the
mouthfeel
not
all
negative
though
not
much
taste
but
also
not
any
bad
stuff
in
here
just
not
enough
character
a
very
clean
tasting
highly
drinkable
brown
ale
that
is
light
in
every
way
for
the
style
you
could
go
through
alot
of
these
but
stylewise
i
prefer
a
flavorful
lager
just
as
underwhelming
i
know
but
for
the
same
price
id
rather
have
a
red
stripe
overallabove
average
for
cleanliness
and
drinkability
but
nothing
to
write
home
to
ma
about
i
can
smell
and
taste
the
slightest
hint
of
a
mrgoodbar
with
this
but
if
you
want
a
noholdsbarred
but
still
yet
drinkable
for
the
style
brown
try
columbus
nut
brown
ale
thin
like
this
clean
like
this
but
much
higher
on
appearance
and
taste
and
it
tastes
like
the
mr
goodbar
is
actually
in
there
ahng
overall
i
give
this
slightly
more
than
a
passing
grade
a
good
effort
definitely
a
beer
you
could
sit
and
have
several
of
while
talking
to
friends
or
to
have
with
supper
since
it
is
a
southern
brewery
and
perhaps
the
nearest
to
me
i
think
i
will
be
having
these
frequently
a
good
solid
beer
easily
read
freshness
dating
on
the
bottle
is
always
a
plus
to
me
as
well
i
wish
they
all
did
although
like
i
said
its
not
what
i
expected
its
a
quaffable
brew
i
would
imagine
being
60
miles
from
the
source
helps
in
the
freshness
dept
as
it
does
taste
very
fresh
no
stale
flavors
detected
d
very
drinkable
and
easy
going
down
a
very
nice
session
brew
for
sure
i
have
had
it
bottled
before
but
this
was
the
first
time
on
tap
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
hope
to
have
it
again
soon
nice
aromas
of
coffees
toffee
and
caramel

all
subtle
tasty
pop
of
a
raspy
woody
and
earthy
dry
brown

english
style
a
fine
drinker
she
went
down
smooth
and
easily
d
with
both
the
brown
and
the
ipa
sweetwater
is
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
a
good
session
beer
with
a
crisp
flavor
and
a
manageable
alcohol
body
d
an
easy
to
drink
and
well
made
brown
very
average
and
nothing
phenomenal
but
very
quaffable
and
worth
a
try
nevertheless
taste
was
balanced
well
between
mild
hops
and
the
malts
overall
a
good
beer
this
is
a
good
dinner
beer
or
something
casual
to
have
when
wanting
to
relax
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
call
for
a
casual
beer
found
this
quite
by
accident
at
the
tgif
in
terminal
b
at
the
atlanta
airport
big
old
fashioned
microphone
tap
handle
spoke
out
for
a
try
i
was
quite
pleased
the
appearance
is
a
solid
chocolate
brown
brew
with
a
sturdy
head
that
held
firm
to
the
very
end
of
my
22
ounces
lacing
is
also
decent
aroma
is
modest
but
is
a
bit
of
brown
bread
and
malt
the
flavor
jumps
out
as
brown
sugar
and
charcoal
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
there
is
a
slight
orange
tang
at
the
tip
somewhat
aqueous
with
friendly
carbonation
throughout
a
very
nice
mild
drinkable
beer
which
i
will
certainly
sample
again
when
given
the
chance
on
tap
at
the
vortex
atlanta
this
is
a
very
nice
nonoffensive
beer
nothing
outlandish
or
unusual
about
it
just
simple
and
nice
standard
to
all
english
browns
this
pours
with
a
tactile
quality
promising
creaminess
and
texutre
with
moderate
carbonation
and
is
well
headed
faint
aromas
of
chocolate
malt
and
toast
flavors
rely
on
sweet
barley
malts
followed
up
by
chocolates
bready
toastiness
hop
balance
and
a
touch
of
lactose
mild
textures
of
smoothness
and
richness
makes
the
brew
pleasant
to
drink
yet
round
enough
to
keep
from
thinning
a
light
alchohol
cooling
and
a
lingering
sweetness
fades
into
cleanlines
late
d

this
beer
is
non
offensive
but
interesting
enough
to
want
more
goes
down
easy
aroma
has
a
hint
of
molasses
and
is
beery
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
color
is
a
pretty
brown
taste
is
malty
and
mild
with
a
smoky
undertone
and
hints
of
caramel
this
beer
works
by
itself
or
as
a
party
drink
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
nice
meal
a
good
session
beer
but
a
bit
light
on
flavor
quite
drinkable
a
very
nice
fall
session
beer
overall
i
would
avoid
this
generic
brown
ale
as
anything
other
than
a
gateway
beer
for
your
macro
friends
drinkability
the
combination
of
clean
feel
and
low
abv
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
hopefully
other
newer
bottles
had
more
pleasant
carbonation
levels
overall
a
solid
but
forgetable
beer
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
but
could
live
without
it
good
beer
when
i
have
a
sugar
tooth
i
did
this
in
a
side
by
side
comparison
with
sam
smiths
nut
brown
ale
they
are
very
similar
but
i
think
this
beer
is
slightly
better
and
then
when
you
compare
the
price
7
for
6
of
sgb
compared
to
9
for
4
of
the
sam
smith
sgb
is
the
clear
winner
above
average
from
one
of
my
favorite
out
of
reach
breweries
drinkability
i
really
didnt
want
to
admit
it
to
myself
but
i
had
no
choice
at
that
point
i
threw
down
my
pint
glass
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
yelled
with
every
last
bit
of
energy
i
had
left
this
is
the
white
bread
of
brown
ales
pours
to
a
bright
copper
color
with
a
hint
of
red
medium
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
okay
aroma
of
malty
nuts
and
honey
flavor
somewhat
on
the
toffee
side
and
this
beer
ahd
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
not
bad
for
a
brown
ale
which
im
not
a
real
fan
of
this
one
has
set
in
my
cellar
for
some
time
a
year
i
have
had
it
medium
to
thin
bodied
with
a
good
deal
of
crispness
easy
to
put
down
quite
refreshing
i
can
see
why
so
many
locals
pick
this
up
its
a
good
transitional
brew
that
can
break
the
summer
heat
very
drinkable
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
its
not
so
nutty
like
other
style
english
browns
are
defineitely
worth
another
visit
the
mouth
is
a
trifle
thin
but
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
worth
a
try
for
sure
clear
brown
beer
with
a
big
head
with
very
little
retention
slight
lacing
sweet
malty
nose
with
a
pinch
of
nuts
and
dark
fruit
smooth
feel
coupled
with
the
sweet
malt
and
nutty
taste
there
is
a
hint
of
ripe
fruit
in
the
finish
balanced
with
a
bitter
note
on
the
way
down
this
is
probably
my
favorite
brown
ale
to
date
great
local
brew
for
me
good
to
see
beers
like
this
coming
out
of
the
south
east
small
and
medium
tan
bubbles
form
a
modest
head
atop
the
burnished
copper
liquid
there
are
but
a
few
sporadic
carbonation
streams
the
head
is
sticky
and
slowly
settles
to
a
thin
skim
coat
the
smell
is
of
sweet
roasted
malt
nut
meats
with
hints
of
honey
and
coffeetoffee
the
taste
is
vacant
up
front
just
plain
empty
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
some
hints
of
roasted
malt
but
none
of
the
rich
flavors
suggested
by
the
smell
there
was
even
a
touch
of
sour
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
body
and
light
mouthfeel
modest
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
one
left
me
wanting
more
i
had
this
beer
in
a
standard
pint
glass
it
is
a
deep
rich
brown
with
very
little
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
early
in
the
session
the
smell
is
a
very
light
malty
chocolate
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
weight
and
fizzy
on
the
edges
of
the
tongue
the
taste
is
a
smooth
light
malty
flavor
with
a
very
light
hoppiness
the
finish
is
of
chocolate
and
lingers
for
a
while
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
great
beer
from
sweetwater
all
round
good
brown
ale
superior
to
newcastle
brown
that
makes
it
to
the
usa
a
very
good
beer
to
convert
a
macro
drinker
with
moderate
mouthfeel
leads
to
a
fairly
decent
overall
drinkability
score
this
ones
straight
3s
all
the
way
down
to
paraphrase
miles
from
sideways
ive
learned
never
to
expect
greatness
from
a
brown
ale
and
this
is
no
exception
a
pity
given
how
much
i
love
sweetwaters
ipa
and
420
pale
ale
aroma
is
almost
citrusy
with
hints
of
almoand
and
cake
ambercopper
hued
with
a
slowly
diminishing
thumb
thick
tan
head
fore
is
mildly
hoppy
then
the
smooth
malts
come
in
some
nuttiness
but
more
sweetness
and
very
mild
toasted
bread
flavor
int
he
finish
very
good
brown
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
instantly
forgettable
thanks
andy
if
i
was
looking
for
a
traditional
english
brown
ale
i
would
probably
choose
this
however
it
is
a
fairly
drinkable
and
unique
brew
as
the
top
of
the
page
already
told
you
its
worth
a
try
comments

thanks
to
uncle
flip
for
including
this
in
his
wtf
bif
package
to
me
it
was
a
thoughtful
gesture
and
made
me
almost
gasp
when
i
saw
it
in
the
box
as
i
had
always
wondered
how
i
could
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
cheers
mate
pours
as
describeda
brown
ale
but
pretty
average
in
the
looks
dept
i
do
like
the
45
rpm
record
holder
logo
no
lace
or
head
to
speak
of
smell
is
brown
sugarry
malt
slight
woody
hoppiness
a
decent
brown
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
deteriorates
as
you
drink
more
of
this
beer
not
in
a
hurry
to
buy
more
of
this
one
thanks
anways
to
rajendra82
for
the
shipment
thanks
again
to
lostbearbrew
for
the
generous
shipment
pours
a
dark
amber
and
the
head
is
thin
and
quick
to
leave
the
scene
the
smell
is
of
sweeter
malts
with
dark
fruits
and
a
wee
bit
of
chocolate
coming
through
though
very
lightely
these
tastes
come
through
on
the
palate
as
well
as
it
is
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
nutty
but
not
overly
so
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
dark
mild
than
a
brown
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
malts
are
subdued
it
finishes
very
clean
with
very
little
of
the
lingering
flavors
i
would
like
to
see
in
the
beer
it
has
potential
it
just
needs
to
have
the
volume
turned
up
sweetwater
can
do
better
although
it
is
hard
to
pin
this
to
a
style
i
would
love
a
full
keg
of
this
in
my
house
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
thin
slightly
off
white
headi
had
to
wait
for
my
bottle
to
warm
a
little
to
start
to
pick
up
on
the
aromas
mainly
of
caramel
malt
and
roasted
nuts
flavors
are
mainly
intune
with
aromas
caramel
and
roasted
nuts
mainly
somewhat
earthy
in
the
finish
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
really
thought
this
beer
was
quite
watery
and
i
think
that
took
away
from
itnothing
horrible
but
not
something
i
would
search
out
agin
overall
a
decent
brew
that
i
would
occasionally
buy
again
if
i
had
the
opportunity
with
just
some
minor
changes
it
could
be
an
outstanding
beer
picked
this
up
at
a
beer
store
in
athens
ga
for
1
59
a
bottle
had
friends
over
for
dinner
tonight
and
a
young
lady
wanted
to
try
something
dark
and
different
im
glad
she
enjoyed
this
and
allowed
me
to
pour
a
taster
tastes
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
almost
as
good
as
the
cottonwood
low
down
brown
this
affirms
my
ultimate
preference
for
english
brown
ales
acquired
via
trade
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
medium
thin
offwhite
head
very
thin
lacing
aroma
of
mild
malt
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
mediumbodied
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
roasty
grain
character
with
malt
caramel
and
nut
flavors
the
finish
is
mildly
sweet
with
just
enough
hops
to
make
it
nicely
drinkable
from
start
to
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
it
isnt
big
in
the
flavor
department
but
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
beer
is
good
happy
beering
not
the
kind
of
thing
id
turn
to
too
often
but
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
overall
not
for
me
pours
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lace
light
carbonation
clear
copper
color
smooth
good
mix
of
hops
and
malts
not
a
heavy
beer
could
be
a
good
summer
drink

medal
winner
at
the
2001
great
american
beer
festival
for
english
style
brown
no
abv
in
sight
a
decent
nut
brown
but
ive
had
better
i
drank
another
the
next
day
at
a
different
temperature
by
warming
it
under
tap
water
at
near
room
temperature
the
unpleasant
notes
in
the
smell
disppeared
and
it
became
a
much
better
session
beer
still
not
the
best
brown
ale
but
much
more
passable
tasted

al
medium

color
of
brown
clear

and
not

and
dark
like
i
like
much
lighter
than
i
expected
and
lighter
than
most
brown

i
have
had
medium
nutty
sweet
smells
some

good
combination
of
the

smells
nice

not

very
easy

remains

the

immediately
offered
caramel
chocolate

with
a
slight
hint
of

i
rated
the
taste
a
little
lower
because
the
aroma
promised
so
much
while
still
a
great
taste
of
malts
and
hints
of
caramel
with
a
smooth
finish
it
just
didnt
live
up
to
the
smell
good
brown
but
would
be
great
if
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
pretty
average
for
a
brown
ale
not
sweetwaters
best
offering
see
their
exodus
porter
and
ipa
overall
an
average
brown
ale
that
seems
to
need
help
in
its
balance
to
sweet
imho
the
beer
is
a
cloudless
copper
color
on
the
pour
with
a
modest
head
frothy
in
texture
and
the
lace
adequate
to
coat
the
glass
nose
is
mostly
malt
sweet
fresh
and
pleasant
enough
start
is
ambrosial
nicely
malted
and
the
top
middling
in
feel
finish
is
stinging
in
its
acidic
bite
the
hops
moderate
in
presence
and
bite
dry
lingering
aftertaste
malty
with
some
caramelly
aspects
too
light
in
color
and
too
thin
in
flavor
an
palate
to
be
a
good
brown
after
drinking
rogue
nutbrown
and
boyne
river
brown
this
cant
get
much
over
average
for
a
brown
this
beer
is
delicious
it
has
a
great
dark
amber
taste
and
the
caramel
and
oaky
flavors
really
shine
through
its
dark
but
not
too
heavy
great
choice
for
all
seasons
nice
rich
malt
flavor
smooth
very
tasty
brown
ale
o
a
solid
brown
tasty
malty
and
simple
in
the
best
way
possible
im
not
a
brown
ale
fan
but
this
was
pertty
good
overall
this
is
a
great
go
to
brown
ale
that
can
easily
get
possible
brown
ale
fans
start
drinking
brown
ales
great
balanced
beer
pours
clear
with
a
small
creamy
head
light
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
has
a
mild
malt
smell
with
a
hint
of
honey
or
molasses
in
the
background
has
a
malt
taste
with
the
molasseshoney
coming
through
mild
carbonation
with
a
nice
finish
a
very
good
brown
ale
with
quite
a
lot
of
depth
really
a
fantastic
brown
much
more
dynamic
and
drinkable
than
most
reds
and
browns
bells
is
up
there
in
quality
in
the
craft
scene
love
bells
not
the
biggest
brown
ale
fan
admittedly
open
minded
i
like
to
think
poured
from
a
pint
can
into
a
pint
glass
can
was
dated
but
i
couldnt
read
it
sweet
ass
owl
on
the
can
clear
brown
with
a
full
finger
of
tan
head
medium
bubbles
and
good
retention
aromas
of
bready
rich
malts
mild
nose
pretty
clean
on
the
palate
nutty
flavors
on
the
midpalate
bready
note
on
the
end
no
noticeable
hops
as
advertised
however
this
had
balance
in
spades
mouthfeel
was
top
notch
extremely
smooth
this
was
by
far
the
best
brown
ale
that
i
have
tried
in
terms
of
browns
this
was
excellent
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
brown
ale
great
balance
between
malt
and
sweetness
and
hops
id
certainly
get
it
again
basic
brown
ale
ok
drinking
beer
a
well
balanced
beer
has
a
nice
level
of
toastiness
balanced
with
some
hops
this
is
a
great
brown
for
any
time
and
it
will
go
good
with
any
food
my
sample
was
fully
four
months
old
and
it
is
just
fine
i
think
i
had
this
before
as
i
remember
it
being
exactly
the
same
great
quality
stuff
that
is
very
drinkable
i
dont
know
why
my
review
is
an
outlier
smooth
fragrant
ale
strong
hops
pleasant
brown
ale
my
favourite
brown
richly
malty
but
surprisingly
bitter
like
most
bells
beers
very
well
balanced
o
this
is
one
of
my
winter
goto
beers
delicious
o
a
good
beer
to
tip
back
over
a
cold
afternoon
in
fall
this
is
a
decent
subtle
take
on
the
english
brown
o
very
good
brown
ale
not
quite
as
good
as
smuttynose
old
brown
dog
imo
overall
my
second
try
at
bells
and
i
was
impressed
great
quality
in
a
bottle
and
as
i
said
earlier
good
brown
ales
need
no
additional
flavorings
o
easydrinking
crowdpleasing
brown
not
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
but
a
solid
entry
very
pleasant
and
balanced
brown
ale
quite
faithful
to
the
english
style
with
controlled
hop
addition
nice
drinkability
as
well
typical
brown
ale
very
drinkable
and
a
definite
drink
again
overall
this
is
an
average
ale
for
me
bells
is
usually
killing
every
beer
style
they
try
but
this
was
average
to
me
overall
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
coming
from
the
aroma
the
aroma
gives
off
very
sweet
scent
and
you
think
youre
in
for
a
very
deep
roasty
sweet
flavor
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
hop
flavor
upfront
like
it
is
nonetheless
its
a
great
beer
just
not
what
i
had
expected
a
wonderfully
done
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
but
still
full
of
flavor
should
be
a
year
round
for
bells
love
this
beer
a
brown
that
is
as
smoothe
as
it
is
delicious
not
nutty
and
not
obnoxiously
brown
a
perfect
expression
of
a
brown
ale
o
super
solid
beer
a
go
to
brown
ale
toasty
nutty
malts
the
whole
way
through
however
the
deep
brown
body
had
some
floatiesresidue
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
overall
id
be
happy
to
have
this
beer
again
but
not
one
of
bells
better
brews
a
very
satisfying
brown
nothing
more
nothing
less

you
can

it
there
is
a

going

you
pick
up
on
rich
spices
and
malts
also
some
sweetness
in
this
brew
the
taste
is
rich
with
hops
and
grains
but
it
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
with
flavor
with
a
clean
smooth

overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
25
out
of
5
this
was
better
than

would
buy

feels
a

ridiculous
saying
for

were
a
letdown
such
as
the

still

be
revisiting

i
have
had
this
one
before
i
wanted
to
give
it
more
time
and
give
it
a
review
i
love
that
they
are
now
including
it
in
the
16
oz
cans
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
really
the
best
no
pun
of
the
brown
ales
i
have
had

but
it
has
enough
bitterness
in
there
to
balance
it
out
i
love
bells
i
have
had
just
about
every
beer
they
have
made
and
liked
almost
all
of
them
this
one
is
a
great
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
its
reasonably
priced
and
made
with
quality
ooverall
a
very
nice
brown
ale
awesome
for
a

o

a
nice

decent
value
at
under
9
for
the
4pack
of
16
oz
cans
a
touch
of
hops
signify
its
time
to
take
another
pull
very
drinkable
im
really
liking
this
style
lately
and
bells
best
brown
ale
is
one
ill
be
coming
back
to
a
mellow
and
easy
drinking
brown
o
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
that
will
always
be
welcome
in
my
glass
highly
recommend
j
one
of
my
favorite
beers
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
dark
beer
i
wish
this
beer
wasnt
seasonal
small
notes
of
cocoa
characterize
the
flavor
of
this
dark
beer
and
allow
for
the
caramel
flavors
to
be
recongized
overall
a
must
try
for
any
beer
drinker
decent
malt
character
but
the
bitterness
is
a
little
dominant
for
my
liking
o
a
solid
straight
forward
brown
from
bells
nothing
fancy
just
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
defiantly
like
it
overall
i
recommend
this
beer
for
any
relaxing
day
when
an
ipa
is
just
too
much
overall
a
solid
straight
forward
brown
from
bells
nothing
fancy
just
a
great
example
of
the
style
pours
a
pretty
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
in
color
with
a
a
1finger
beige
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
then
settles
down
to
a
thin
head
decent
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
maple
malts
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
even
better
with
a
toffee
and
caramel
hint
as
well
perfect
carbonation
goes
down
easy
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
beer
is
that
is
seasonal
it
comes
out
in
the
fall
and
is
gone
by
the
beginning
of
winter
from
the
smell
to
the
taste
i
cant
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
it
has
the
perfect
hint
of
coacoa
and
open
up
your
taste
buds
enough
and
you
get
the
caramel
ive
also
had
it
out
of
the
mini
keg
but
still
prefer
the
bottle
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
out
of
a
brown
ale
nothing
too
fancy
straight
to
the
point
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
in
a
good
way
overall
another
great
high
quality
beer
from
bells
who
are
probably
my
favorite
brewery
at
this
point
so
i
might
just
be
biased
with
sierra
nevadas
tumbler
being
discontinued
this
might
become
my
go
to
fall
seasonal
beer
overall
i
do
not
like
this
beer
it
seems
to
have
taken
the
brown
ale
tradition
and
forced
it
down
the
american
ale
cascade
hop
road
to
attempt
to
make
it
taste
like
many
of
the
woefully
unbalanced
american
craft
beers
out
there
that
favor
bitter
over
balance
overall
this
may
not
be
the
most
exciting
bells
offering
and
i
blame
that
on
everyones
love
of
big
styles
of
beer
this
is
quite
the
offering
for
the
autumn
seasons
made
for
a
crisp
autumn
evening
with
friends
and
loved
ones
nice
amber
brown
hue
head
is
minimal
and
slowly
fades
good
carbonation
amber
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
is
inviting
fairly
carbonated
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
leaves
a
lingering
tingle
on
your
tongue
theres
plenty
of
amber
malt
and
caramel
flavor
a
pretty
straightforward
session
beer
o
another
fine
product
from
bells
its
not
the
absolute
best
brown
ale
ive
tasted
but
it
would
not
be
out
of
place
at
any
pub
in
england
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
one
pretty
straightforward
brown
ale
that
does
not
disappoint
i
love
this
brown
ale
it
isnt
my
favorite
but
a
close
2nd
and
you
will
understand
why
if
you
had
koko
brown
by
kona
simply
the
best
that
bells
has
to
offer
nice
brown
color
and
a
nice
tan
lace
taste
is
irresistable
only
the
koko
brown
hais
more
of
an
addictive
flavor
and
i
consider
best
brown
and
koko
brown
in
the
same
category
the
taste
is
so
similar
its
uncanny
but
i
love
coconut
i
want
to
people
to
know
thiese
two
beers
are
almost
hand
and
hand
and
bells
in
my
area
is
big
i
live
in
indiana
not
too
far
from
the
michigan
line
kudos
kudos
kudos
a
hazy
medium
brown
the
creamy
off
white
head
leaves
a
thin
sheen
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
a
sweet
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
malt
forward
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
and
hops
thinner
feel
is
good
with
the
overall
sweetness
of
the
beer
a
nice
brown
ale
that
doesnt
overawe
but
doesnt
disappoint
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
brown
ale
it
has
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
hop
and
roast
to
make
for
an
easy
drinking
and
tasty
brew
i
dont
know
if
it
is
truly
the
best
brown
but
very
good
and
worth
getting
again
overall
nice
for
when
the
weather
is
getting
colder
solid
beer
that
represents
the
brown
ale
category
well
overall
its
okay
but
i
would
not
buy
again
i
think
its
categorized
as
an
english
brown
but
its
too
hoppy
for
that
the
caramel
malt
and
earthy
hops
do
not
mesh
well
in
this
beer
the
ingredients
do
not
complement
each
other
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
guess
you
could
have
it
in
the
warmer
or
colder
months
but
i
personally
would
rather
have
a
nice
stout
or
the
aforementioned
winter
solstice
glad
i
tried
it
but
dont
imagine
ill
be
buying
six
packs
of
it
o
a
fairly
typical
brown
ale
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
its
just
not
very
impressive
or
inspiring
to
drink
wouldnt
buy
it
again
most
likely
overall
fond
of
this
as
a
fall
beer
wellbalanced
bitterness
and
sweet
flavors
i
will
go
back
to
this
cheers
the
feel
is
dry
ever
so
slightly
astringent
and
relatively
easy
on
the
stomach
o
one
of
my
favorite
autumn
brown
ales
it
has
everything
needed
to
give
you
a
nice
warming
experience
when
the
days
start
getting
shorter
and
the
nights
longer
a
real
classic
brown
ale
that
finds
its
way
to
my
fridge
every
fall
oa
pretty
good
brown
ale
the
nose
is
fantastic
and
wellblended
but
the
taste
could
be
improved
the
earthy
notes
nutty
oaky
mix
well
with
the
sweetness
and
is
why
brown
ales
are
so
delicious
but
this
one
finished
with
an
uncanny
acidic
taste
still
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
dependable
brown
ale
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
character
in
the
flavor
profile
but
ill
definitely
have
it
again
as
its
readily
available
here
in
michigan
this
beer
should
go
well
with
many
foods
it
struck
me
that
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
but
the
abv
is
a
little
high
5
8
for
this
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
its
flavor
and
its
drinkability
really
what
is
most
remarkable
about
this
beer
is
how
appropriate
it
is
for
the
season
it
is
hearty
enough
in
the
grain
and
sweetness
to
keep
you
happily
sipping
as
the
air
starts
to
cool
and
the
leaves
start
to
change
the
aroma
was
a
bit
dull
but
fit
generally
well
into
the
big
picture
of
it
all
to
note
the
feel
was
also
surprisingly
creamy
and
this
definitely
had
a
good
part
in
why
we
had
such
a
positive
experience
with
this
one
so
go
grab
a
sixpack
and
share
with
some
close
friends
because
this
guy
will
hit
the
spot
right
about
now
o
really
a
solid
brew
that
is
a
perfect
compliment
to
an
octoberfest
on
a
fall
day
overall
not
a
favorite
especially
for
bells
maybe
my
expectations
were
too
high
o
a
good
brown
ale
that
fits
right
in
with
fall
easy
drinking
with
crisp
light
roast
flavors
pours
a
nice
even
brown
with
a
1
12
finger
khaki
head
that
sits
awhile
lacing
is
everywhere
as
you
drink
lots
of
roasted
caramel
up
front
in
the
aroma
some
toffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
are
also
present
very
sweet
nose
to
this
the
taste
is
also
very
roasted
in
nature
the
caramel
and
toffee
stick
out
the
most
the
feel
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
maybe
a
tad
to
thin
but
still
not
bad
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
one
that
may
be
the
perfect
for
the
fall
not
a
whole
lot
of
oily
stickiness
from
the
hops
but
the
deep
carmel
malt
body
keeps
it
nice
and
rich
carbonation
is
moderate
which
makes
it
slightly
creamy
update

had
put
away
the
second
bottle
in
basement
storage
and
forgot
about
it
until
recently
when
i
reviewed
storage
to
find
brews
i
had
saved
for
winter
bottled
1713
so
its
now
over
a
year
old
only
things
about
my
review
id
change
are
the
aroma
was
caramel
malty
it
had
more
body
and
a
definite
hop
presence
which
mellowed
out
still
think
its
a
c
4
0
brew
outstanding
but
not
moreso
than
a
number
of
ne
brews
in
the
same
category
which
i
can
buy
regularly
if
i
want
more
bells
ill
have
to
go
to
pa
or
western
n
y
and
probably
pay
a
premium
these
i
bought
in
michigan
last
june
in
a
mixed
six
for
1
69
each
i
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
in
south
carolina
after
attempting
and
failing
the
ocean
course
at
kiawah
island
really
just
an
excellent
brown
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
nutty
burnt
caramel
flavor
i
cant
comment
on
the
appearance
because
i
had
this
straight
out
of
the
bottle
at
night
so
ive
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
this
review
that
it
probably
looks
similar
to
most
other
browns
solid
after
dinner
beer
o
solid
brown
ale
not
too
bold
but
not
lacking
any
desired
qualities
o
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
fairly
sessionable
despite
the
alcohol
content
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
heavy
winter
ale
it
is
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
d
exactly
what
it
ought
to
be
but
nothing
memorable
super
approachable
and
about
as
middleoftheroad
as
you
can
get
o
overall
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
it
had
a
wonderful
flavor
that
made
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
do
recommend
it
and
i
would
obviously
drink
it
again
this
brown
ale
has
a
bit
more
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
than
youll
probably
find
in
most
other
browns
it
is
not
overdone
in
this
respect
but
takes
a
backseat
on
the
palate
after
you
taste
the
light
caramel
and
toast
flavors
12
ounce
bottle
into
signature
pint
glass
bottled

pours
fairly
cloudy
brown
copper
color
with
a
nice
12

light
khaki
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice

that
lasts
nice
spotty
soapy

clings
down
the
glass
aromas
of

toast
light
cocoa
brown

brown

lingering

on

for
a

balance
and
complexity
of
flavors
with
a
fair
amount
of
robustness
with
zero
cloying
flavors
present
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
lightly
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
nice
balance
with
fairly
robust
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
pleasantly
enjoyable
offering
o
a
serviceable
brown
ale
nothing
more
nothing
less
brown
ales
tend
to
be
low
on
my
list
but
rating
this
among
other
beers
in
its
style
i
found
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
not
something
id
get
again
but
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
enjoyed
with
the
man
who
put
humpty
dumpty
back
together
again
my
orthopedic
trauma
surgeon
served
from
bottle
into
a
flared
pilsner
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutty
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
toasted
malt
nutty
nutmeg
and
subtle
caramel
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
was
really
quite
intrigued
by
this
one
once
i
smelled
the
dark
chocolate
notes
in
it
however
to
my
slight
disappointment
this
note
did
not
carry
over
into
the
flavor
despite
this
it
did
not
kill
the
brew
at
all
this
one
was
rather
easy
drinking
and
quite
enjoyable
definitely
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
in
awhile
as
most
are
hitandmiss
that
ive
had
recently
with
other
flavors
infused
into
them
worth
your
time
trying
without
a
doubt
had
this
with
lunch
at
the
westwood
tavern
in
schaumburg
nice
transparent
brown
with
good
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
smells
of
brown
sugar
and
tastes
the
same
fairly
solid
brown
ale
nothing
mind
blowing
some
nuttiness
easy
drinker
i
like
a
good
brown
and
this
is
good
but
a
bit
of
a
let
down
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
knock
every
style
they
take
on
out
of
the
park
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brown
ale
yet
another
great
offering
by
bells
o
i
always
enjoy
best
brown
whenever
its
available
i
dont
necessarily
drink
a
lot
of
browns
but
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favs
when
im
in
the
mood
o
overall
it
was
exremely
average
i
could
have
it
at
the
the
bar
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
for
the
home
nothing
frilly
just
a
really
well
done
brown
ale
the
balance
is
great
theres
no
hop
smell
but
they
nicely
cancel
out
the
sweetness
that
could
easily
be
in
this
beer
given
the
amount
of
grains
they
pack
in
i
think
the
taste
is
great
but
personally
i
think
its
almost
on
the
verge
of
a
porter
in
darkness
and
alcohol
content
not
quite
as
light
as
most
of
the
brown
ales
im
used
to
nevertheless
this
is
a
great
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
no
frills
well
done
brown
pours
brown
with
a
bit
of
a

the
aroma

and
a
bit
of
fruit
on
the
finish
nice
easy
drinker
good
beer
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
a
little
light
for
my
tastes
but
enjoyed
the
one
bottle
i
bought
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
good
representation
of
the
style
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
nice
in
the
winter
and
i
suspect
year
around
overall
i
believe
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
now
ive
always
been
impressed
by
bells
beers
in
general
and
this
ale
is
no
different
highly
recommended
best
brown
ale
pours
a
cloudy
copper
to
brown
color
with
a
nice
cap
of
creamy
foam
the
nose
is
light
and
grainy
fitting
for
a
brown
ale
the
aroma
that
it
does
produce
is
a
pleasant
darkly
roasted
malt
with
nutty
overtones
the
brown
malt
theme
continues
on
the
palate
with
a
creamy
smooth
malt
texture
a
slight
bitterness
provides
balance
toward
the
end
this
brew
has
all
the
makings
of
good
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
the
hops
and
the
cocoa
make
this
beer
an
interesting
and
palatable
brown
this
is
more
an
american
brown
style
wise
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
has
quite
complex
flavors
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style

this
was
pretty
good
i
loved
it
when
i
first
started
tasting
beers
but
now
that
im
trying
it
again
it
is
just
a
little
too
light
for
my
tastes
i
would
certainly
drink
it

offered

again

nice
good
but
not
for
me
bells
best
brown
is
an
awesome
beer
allaround
this
being
my
first
brown
ale
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
i
feel
like
this
tastes
a
good
bit
like
a
porter
but
it
doesnt
rely
quite
as
heavily
on
the
coffeechocolate
notes
its
just
a
big
malty
beer
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
surprising
bells
knows
what
theyre
doing
this
was
a
solid
brown
ale
very
flavorful
but
still
sessionable
this
beer
would
pair
extremely
well
with
your
typical
holiday
fare
like
ham
or
turkey
o
really
flavorful
i
tend
to
find
brown
ales
too
dull
and
boring
but
this
has
a
real
nice
flavor
to
it
o
overall
it
might
not
be
the
best
brown
ale
that
is
out
there
but
its
pretty
darn
good
buy
it
and
try
it
oa
decent
brown
ale
could
have
used
a
better
hop
presence
balance
was
good
though
great
beer
definitely
buy
some
if
you
have
the
opportunity
overall
nothing
about
this
beer
really
stands
out
its
just
an
average
beer
i
dont
see
any
need
to
seek
it
out
but
if
you
see
it
around
and
want
to
try
something
different
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
personally
want
more
sweetness
or
nuttiness
out
of
a
brown
ale

a
very
good
example
of
the
style
nice
balance
and
highly
drinkable
o
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
just
satisfies
my
palate
everything
from
a
sweet
tooth
to
a
need
for
complexity
full
flavor
drinkability
and
memorable
character
it
reminds
me
of
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
theres
just
something
so
sweet
and
savory
about
it
very
very
solid
brown
ale
perfect
for
the
days
transitioning
from
the
fall
to
the
winter
this
beer
tastes
like
the
holidays
pours
a
slightly
translucent
brownamber
with
a
dark
brown
head
that
fades
to
about
one
fingers
and
settles
out
to
almost
nothing
nose
is
caramel
brown
sugar
molasses
burnt
sugar
and
there
also
seems
to
be
just
a
hint
of
piney
hops
the
taste
isnt
nearly
as
malty
and
heavy
as
the
nose
there
are
caramel
flavors
that
are
immediately
overpowered
by
piney
slightly
citrusy
hops
then
it
fades
into
a
slightly
bitter
molasses
flavor
it
fades
out
with
the
hops
still
sitting
on
the
tongue
and
some
slight
hints
of
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
kind
of
a
heavy
feel
behind
it
the
carbonation
is
perfect
for
this
type
of
brew
im
usually
not
too
big
on
a
lot
of
bells
daytoday
brews
except
for
two
hearted
but
this
one
is
actually
pretty
delicious
this
offering
from
bells
pours
up
a
ruby
redbrown
with
about
a
two
finger
head
and
minimal
lacing
nose
is
primarily
pine
and
floral
accents
mouthfeel
is
pleasing
but
not
much
carbonation
taste
is
fairly
mild
with
some
malt
and
coffee
flavors
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
this
is
a
good
beer
as
youd
expect
from
bells
but
honestly
it
is
fairly
indistinctive
i
prefer
samuel
smiths
esb
to
this
d
an
outstanding
world
class
english
brown
ale
this
is
something
that
ill
make
sure
i
invest
in
each
fall
when
it
is
released
no
weaknesses
very
good
in
all
facets
and
off
the
charts
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
highly
recommended
solid
brown
ale
overall
o
this
is
a
really
nice
brown
ale
i
think
the
additions
of
cocoa
caramel
and
complementary
hops
give
this
beer
some
nice
nuances
that
not
many
brown
ales
have
all
the
usual
toasted
and
nutty
malt
flavors
are
there
plus
more
bells
doesnt
disappoint
overall
i
liked
this
dont
want
to
overstate
but
its
a
little
too
meh
good
but
better
browns
out
there
for
sure
the
appearance
was
an
inch
of
head
and
a
dark
brown
in
color
the
smell
is
dark
fruits
with
malts
nice
nose
the
taste
is
an
expressocoffee
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
this
is
a
decent
brown
if
i
was
a
coffee
drinker
this
offering
would
be
even
more
attractive
to
me
but
since
im
not
this
is
one
that
i
could
have
again
but
will
not
go
out
of
the
way
to
have
o
bells
always
makes
some
of
my
favorites
and
this
brown
ale
is
another
good
beer
from
them
definitely
one
of
the
best
for
the
money
bottle
to
nonick
pint
solid
two
finger
foam
with
good
lacing
color
reminds
me
of
sweet
tea
but
i
poured
the
whole
bottle
cold
so
it
clouded
up
a
bit
notes
of
caramel
maybe
toast
and
just
a
very
slight
bit
of
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
caramelly
body
is
ok
nothing
great
or
bad
here
but
it
does
finish
smooth
beer
improved
significantly
as
it
warmed
up
a
clean
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
decidely
moreish
do
thirst
quenching
for
sure
just
a
nice
sessionable
malty
brown
ale
its
nice

have

mediumfine
frothy

a

a

tastes

the

very
much
a
generally
pleasing
ale
i
could
see
how
this
would
be
a
crowd
pleaser
no
notable
overarching
notes
on
first
taste
that
arent
uncommon
for
an
ale
great
aftertaste
though
a
little
vanilla
and
oddly
a
little
melon
very
smooth
flavorpacked
forget
newcastle
my
notes
say
this
is
the
shit
overall
bells
brown
ale
is
a
switch
up
from
the
average
english
brown
ale
the
carbonation
is
what
threw
me
off
i
guess
i
am
used
to
the
traditional
lightly
carbonated
almost
chewy
in
body
brown
ales
but
never
the
less
bells
brown
ale
is
a
tasty
dark
brew
meh
this
is
far
from
the
best
an
average
nut
brown
one
of
the
better
browns
that
i
have
had
i
really
enjoyed
the
way
the
aroma
and
flavor
complemented
each
other
perfect
for
a
fall
bonfire
and
readily
available
in
the
akron
area
nice
brew
theres
a
lot
to
be
said
for
a
sturdy
brown
ale
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
plus
the
bottle
had
an
owl
on
the
label
and
owls
are
awesome
bells
best
brown
pours
a
very
nice
mahogany
with
plenty
of
red
highlights
the
cream
colored
foam
quickly
billows
up
to
over
three
fingers
in
height
before
slowly
creeping
down
the
lacing
is
left
behind
in
sheets
and
if
the
head
retention
were
just
a
little
more
impressive
the
looks
would
be
perfect
the
nose
has
plenty
of
caramel
and
toasted
nuts
but
the
spicyherbal
hop
aroma
is
just
a
little
too
intensemisplaced
my
comments
for
the
flavor
profile
would
be
largely
the
same
some
of
the
classic
flavors
from
the
style
are
nicely
rendered
but
the
hops
which
the
website
calls

i
thought
this
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
english
brown
ale
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
this
style
but
so
far
this
beer
seems
to
be
the
closest
example
i
have
had
to
a
true
english
brown
ale
the
flavors
were
nice
and
malty
and
had
a
really
nice
nutty
complexity
that
really
made
this
beer
stick
out
from
the
other
english
brown
ales
i
have
tried
it
went
down
really
smooth
and
combined
with
having
no
bitterness
at
all
makes
this
beer
have
some
great
drinkability
everything
was
pretty
spot
on
and
the
extra
nuttiness
put
this
beer
over
the
top
bells
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
and
i
honestly
expect
something
with
a
little
more
complexity
and
depth
from
such
an
accomplished
brewery
recommended
to
any
bells
fan
or
ba
new
to
malty

bells
does

their
brown
hits
the

once

o
one
of
my
favorite
goto
browns
for
the
style
immensely
drinkable
and
flavorful
o
not
a
bad
brown
ale
it
just
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
on
but
i
guess
you
could
say
that
about
most
brown
ales
o
excellent
brown
ale
i
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
almost
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
less
than
onefinger
offwhite
head
lace
was
tight
and
clingy
the
nose
was
well
more
malty
than
hoppy
more
like
bread
taste
was
very
grassy
intially
with
phenols
definitely
noticeable
medium
bodied
with
taste
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
with
average
carbonation
still
waiting
to
try
hopslam
but
this
one
is
not
that
memorable
from
bells

i
like
bells

this
might

wo
being

for

i
much
prefer
the

entry
m
medium
carbonation
medium

i
ended
up
drinking
a
single
from
my
six
pack
and
letting
the
rest
sit
for
2
months
i
can
say
that
there
was
a
big
improvement
in
the
taste
which
is
represented
in
the
score
much
sweeter
with
a
slight
nutiness
caramel
brown
sugar
and
toffee
made
this
brown
ale
much
more
balanced
and
enjoyable
o
pretty
decent
beer
i
dont
like
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
as
i
move
to
other
more
interesting
things
there
are
a
couple
more
browns
that
i
like
better
than
this
o
pretty
good
no
offflavors
just
a
simple
sweet
toasted
caramel
malt
flavor
no
nuttiness
to
speak
of
this
one
is
more
fruity
and
sweet
t
i
can
dig
this
can
you
dig
it
brown
beer
that
has
a
beige
head
that
left
behind
a
tiny
bit
of
spots
and
lace
it
smells
of
caramel
and
sugar
with
some
raisins
or
figs
or
other
type
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
about
the
same
and
quite
pleasant
really
focuses
on
the
brown
sugar
aspect
mouthfeel
is
slightly
over
carbonated
but
not
bad
this
is
an
above
average
brown
i
would
drink
again
hard
to
go
wrong
with
bells
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
one
of
the
better
browns
that
ive
had
beers
of
this
style
dont
really
stand
up
and
draw
attention
to
themselves
the
good
ones
are
meant
to
be
tame
mild
and
wellbehaved
like
this
one
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
chilly
rainy
afternoon
like
this
one
overall
nice
easy
drinker
with
plenty
of
flavors
low
alcohol
adds
to
drinkibilty
slighty
sweeter
then
typical
english
brown
ales
but
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
another
quailty
beer
from
bells
btw
i
skipped
using
the
spoon
overall
it
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
it
does
not
stand
out
as
amazing
but
id
buy
it
again
o
almost
tastes
like
too
much
water
was
used
in
the
sparge
o
solid
english
brown
ale
easy
drinking
and
pretty
sessionable
for
a
style
that
can
be
bland
bells
does
a
good
job
here
light
to
medium
in
body
a
bit
syrupy
almost
has
a
belgian
like
feel
to
it
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
come
back
to
overall
a
really
fine
brown
ale
thats
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
have
no
problem
buying
this
again
very
good
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
overall
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
forgettable
the
flavor
profile
is
just
not
on
par
with
other
brown
ales
i
have
had
recently
english
brown
ales
arent
supposed
to
be
as
malty
and
fullbodied
as
american
ones
so
i
guess
they
accomplished
their
goal
of
creating
a
fairly
tasty
sessionable
brown
ale
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
anytime
soon
overall
a
good
brown
maybe
not
the
best

a

nice
brown
ale
a
touch
on
the
dry
side
with
lots
of

an

roasty

towards

the

is
light
and
does
not

in

it
is
sufficient
to

the

goes
down

and
still
has
enough
flavor
and
darkness
to
it
to
qualify
it
as
an
autumn
beverage
i
tore
through
two
of
these
over
lunch
so
its
a
session
beer
for
certain
deep
brown
with
a
onefinger
tan
head
it
falls
away
quickly
but
leaves
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
could
have
looked
nicer
but
definitely
not
bad
the
aroma
was
malty
but
faint
a
modest
amount
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
intertwined
with
a
hop
aroma
the
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
downer
as
id
hoped
for
more
of
a
malt
presence
but
got
more
hop
bitterness
there
was
also
an
astringent
grainy
character
that
didnt
really
add
anything
to
the
beer
this
is
the
first
offering
from
bells
that
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
with
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
and
once
of
the
easiest
drinking
brown
ales
i
have
had
another
great
beer
form
bells
this
is
an
autumn
beer
for
sure
its
a
very
pleasant
brown
ale
its
not
very
complex
but
it
works
for
what
it
is
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
it
iis
fairly
smooth
but
it
does
have
some
crispness
to
it
overall
i
would
drink
it
again
in
fact
i
have
five
more
at
least
to
drink
a
good
but
not
great
brown
ale
thats
worth
trying
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
very
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
not
too
harsh
on
the
palate
d
i
wish
larry
would
brew
this
one
yearround
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
one
that
i
can
sip
on
time
after
time
this
was
the
first
bells
best
brown
ale
ive
had
i
wont
necessarily
be
seeking
out
more
not
all
that
more
interesting
than
killians
red
fairly
light
bland
overall
one
of
the
better
english
brown
ales
i
have
had
very
nice
flavors
to
it
very
hoppy
as
well
so
it
was
well
balanced
easy
drinking
beer
gotta
love
bells
in
cooking
and
barbeque
sauces
cheers
this
is
very
drinkable
i
dont
doubt
that
the
nose
would
really
pick
up
and
the
body
would
firm
up
a
little
from
the
bottle
d
a
little
heavier
than
most
browns
but
tasty
and
smooth
enough
to
session
through
if
its
fall
bells
brown
is
back
as
a
seasonal
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
as
most
bells
brews
have
it
had
a
nice
beige
ring
with
lacing
til
the
end
the
smell
was
malts
and
toffee
some
chocolate
and
some
roasted
coffee
the
taste
was
the
same
chocolate
and
coffee
dominate
with
hops
and
malt
its
kinda
like
a
lite
stout
this
is
a
tasty
brew
for
the
fall
one
i
look
forward
to
a
tasty
brown
for
sure
its
a
winter
warmer
d
perfect
as
far
as
a
simple
uncomplicated
sessionable
ale
is
concerned
this
is
one
to
be
admired
not
in
spite
of
but
because
of
its
simplicity
mediumfull
body
soft
texture
smooth
easy
drinker
yet
another
winner
from
bells
a
nice
sessionable
brown
ale
from
bells
was
a
perfect
companion
with
pepperoni
lovers
pizza
drinkability
a
slightly
above
average
to
average
english
brown
the
mix
of
hops
to
malts
is
fine
but
this
beer
is
indistinguishable
from
others
i
have
tried
one
that
i
would
have
again
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
but
nothing
i
search
for
overall
not
to
shabby
of
a
brown
ale
no
samuel
smiths
but
worth
a
try
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
semitransparent
chocolaty
brown
with
a
finebubbled
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
of
average
strength
malty
and
slightly
chocolaty
rich
malty
flavor
has
cocoa
undertone
along
with
nutty
and
caramel
hints
as
well
as
just
a
whisper
of
fine
coffee
texture
is
thick
fairly
smooth
and
nicely
fizzy
d
a
good
to
solid
brown
ale
for
the
fall
season
when
you
tire
of
oktoberfests
or
wethopped
beers
nothing
fancy
just
classic
drinking
poured
a
cloudy
medium
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
that
slowly
faded
to
a
solid
skin
unfortunately
my
nose
has
failed
me
again
and
i
didnt
get
anything
the
taste
was
nutty
sweet
safe
and
comfortable
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
sufficient
carbonation
drinkability
was
quite
good
best
brown
was
a
good
beer
that
doesnt
require
you
to
be
a
risk
taker
to
enjoy
that
said
its
not
very
exciting
either
i
would
definitely
drink
again
reminds
me
of
newcastle
mfd
mediumfull
in
body
lingering
nutty
finish
drinkability
very
solid
example
of
a
traditional
brown
ale
if
it
wasnt
for
the
aftertaste
this
would
be
topnotch
this
is
a
highly
quaffable
brew
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
satisfying
d
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
brown
ales
the
style
is
not
the
most
complex
but
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
beer
appearance
is
a
medium
deep
brown
with
some
haziness
and
little
floaties
from
the
bottle

good
carbonation
and

retention

breadybicuity
characteristics
rise
up

some

and
coffee
tones
feels
creamy
with
a
little
carbonation
bite
at
the
end
really
like
this
brown
ale
overall
not
my
favorite
bells
beer
or
example
of
the
style
but
pretty
solid
nonetheless
worth
a
try
for
sure
drinkability
this
is
pretty
good
i
could
certainly
get
this
again
and
enjoy
it
but
i
think
i
would
prefer
something
that
is
a
little
more
balanced
for
my
tastes
overall
it
seems
to
me
that
this
brown
ale
is
almost
too
heavy
for
mass
comsumptionboth
on
the
wallet
and
the
stomach
flavors
were
really
nice
and
has
a
good
american
hoppy
characteristic
that
i
like
though
would
like
this
one
to
be
less
filling
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
because
i
prefer
the
milder
taste
instead
of
overpowering
burntcaramelized
flavors
associated
with
most
brown
ales
slightly
watered
down
with
a
subtle
smoked
maltiness
along
with
some
oatmeal
chocolate
malt
hazelnut
and
subtle
hop
notes
finish
is
slightly
dry
pretty
drinkable
session
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
supposedly
a
seasonal
fallwinter
beer
but
available
midjuly
the
brown
ale
pours
a
beautiful
clear
brown
with
a
tancolored
thick
mousselike
head
the
head
persists
and
leaves
intricate
belgian
lace
when
sipped
the
nose
is
both
delicate
and
noticeable
with
hints
of
toasted
bread
toffee
malt
and
ginger
the
malt
notes
are
light
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
on
the
palate
the
ale
has
a
medium
body
perfect
balance
and
a
wonderful
lingering
finish
that
wants
you
to
go
back
for
this
ale
is
totally
moreish
the
carbonation
pleasant
and
the
alcohol
is

bells
best

is

ale
with

dense
frothy
coffeecream
colored

thats
elastic

it
coats

the

with

that
only
sticks
around
for

minimal

on

as
noted
from

it
has
the
familiar
particles
floating
in

near

of

pleasant

aroma
slight

that

with

slightly
more
bitter

it

it
invites

in
for

next
sip
very
drinkable
and
a
fine
beer
overall
poured
from

to
the
trusty

in

things
out

good
interpretation
on

sometimes
underwhelming
style
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
i
just
might
being
that
we
dont

what

was
all
about

d
this
is
one
that
i
could

keep

was

you
expect

it

a

i
could

the
beer
goes
easy
on
the
hops
but
throws
in
enough
other
great
flavors
to
keep
the
beer
interesting
a

winner

makes

that
dissipates
quickly
there
is
not
a

what
is

a

very

stays
on

citrus
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
smooth
medium
bodied
lightly
carbonated
with
flavors
of
light
caramel
malt
some
citrus
zest
and
a
touch
of
pecans
maybe
a
hint
of
grass
finish
is
smooth
creamy
with
a
more
malty
aftertaste
than
any
bitterness
very
quaffableand
quite
enjoyable
d
i
wished
i
had
bought
more
than
1
i
look
forward
to
trying
again
its
not
so
heavy
as
their
slowsipping
stout
or
any
stout
really
and
that
could
make
it
a
good
session
beer
if
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
nice
medium
bodied
brown
maybe
a
little
hot
for
the
style
but
what
do
i
know
i
guess
its
on
the
high
end
really
a
very
drinkable
and
quality
brown
ale
of
course
it
is
malty
roasty
and
flavorful
but
it
has
a
nice
hop
balance
to
it
very
smooth
and
drinkable
its
crisp
with
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
just
a
hint
of
fruitiness
adds
to
the
complexity
a
most
delicious
session
beer
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
pours
a
decent
light
brown
color
getting
lighter
as
the
beer
drains
some
good
head
and
lacing
nothing
great
nice
scent
very
sweet
and
malty
but
not
as
earthy
as
i
like
great
taste
though
fairly
deep
nice
maltiness
with
a
great
hoppy
bite
towards
the
end
fading
to
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
goes
down
quite
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
but
conservative
staple
even
example
of
the
style
a
very
fine
example
of
all
that
can
be
wonderful
about
this
style
a
very
solid
and
thoroughly
delicious
brown
ale
that
should
not
be
overlooked
in
the
presence
of
bigger
beers
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipates
small
is
of
a
light
nut
smell
i
let
it
warm
up
as
i
thought
is
was
too
cold
from
the
fridge
to
start
getting
a
rightful
taste
test
of
this
a
decent
nut
taste
but
a
bit
too
weak
a
decent
brew
to
drink
if
you
dont
feel
like
spending
the
money
on
sam
smith
nut
brown
ale
d
pretty
good
could
be
mistaken
for
a
session
beer
even
i
would
say
if
i
just
tasted
it
something
i
would
buy
again
huge
whipped
up
head
looks
like
the
foam
sealant
you
use
to
insulate
cracks
light
brown
in
hue
with
tenacious
lacing
opaque
mud
brown
which
drops
off
to
redder
brick
and
then
orange
at
the
rims
lightening
just
enough
to
see
the
active
beads
at
times
sherrylike
nose
of
nuts
dates
figs
followed
on
by
caramel
and
brown
sugar
root
beer
never
slumps
nor
loses
pacing
but
hard
to
credit
the
absent
hops
for
this
simply
sticks
to
a
smaller
array
of
scents
and
deepens
them
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
level
is
fine
and
allows
for
flavor
saturation
coffee
toffee
milk
chocolate
on
hand
but
too
watered
down
for
much
effect
that
root
beer
thing
remains
more
grain
oats
here
texturally
tightens
towards
the
finish
hazelnut
and
brazil
nut
too
creamy
soft
texture
appealing
but
cannot
make
up
for
how
the
flavors
drop
up
through
the
midpalate
nothing
wrong
with
a
beer
aiming
to
be
tactful
but
you
still
need
a
reason
to
pop
another
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
nice
caramel
brown
color
with
a
tall
off
white
head
that
leaves
great
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
full
of
malt
character
with
hints
of
roasted
almonds
light
chocolate
and
some
burnt
caramel
the
taste
was
a
little
thin
but
full
of
flavor
this
has
a
nice
balance
and
a
good
finish
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
the
taste
is
a
little
underwhelming
and
lacking
in
complexity
but
overall
a
quite
drinkable
beer
i
would
definitely
have
another
although
this
is
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
unfortunately
im
having
this
in
february
instead
of
late
fall
when
i
could
see
this
going
well
with
blankets
and
a
campfire
poured
beer
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
and
dark
reddish
brown
color
first
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
hardly
any
hops
mild
sweetness
continues
in
the
taste
and
the
hops
becomes
a
little
more
present
medium
mouth
feel
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
nice
drinkable
beer
has
enough
character
to
stand
out
from
other
english
browns
but
still
true
to
form
though
abv
at
6
60
may
be
a
little
high
for
the
style
definitely
a
solid
beer
to
have
around
i
think
the
flavor
of
this
would
be
awesome
to
give
to
a
bmc
drinker
as
a
gateway
overall
bells
makes
solid
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
browns
no
pun
intended
ive
ever
had
pick
it
up
drinkability
very
drinkable
because
of
the
balance
of
flavors
the
alcohol
is
not
very
high
but
newcastle
drinkers
will
be
surprised
by
it
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
on
tap
at
a
little
bar
just
south
of
wisconsin
bells
is
truly
back
in
il
poured
a
hazel
brown
minimally
cloudy
with
a
thin
head
only
some
lacing
throughout
the
smell
was
of
fresh
dark
bread
and
toasted
nuts
this
carried
into
the
taste
which
was
of
rustic
brown
bread
and
caramelmalt
some
hopspice
gave
a
plesant
balance
none
of
which
was
overly
strong
it
was
satisfyingly
full
on
the
tongue
but
marred
by
an
overabundance
of
carbonation
ill
blame
the
bar
not
a
style
i
normally
reach
for
first
but
thoroughly
enjoyable
through
2
pints
6
6abv
is
a
slight
caution
against
drinking
these
all
night
especially
with
friends
having
4
4
macros
three
fingers
of
tan
creamy
head
sit
atop
this
deep
redbrown
beer
the
head
last
for
awhile
leaving
lacing
throughout
the
duration
of
the
drink
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
with
a
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
in
the
background
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
added
to
it
mouthfeel
was
exceptional
very
smooth
with
a
decent
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
a
definite
recommendation
drinkability
great
session
beer
poured
to
a
big
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
head
was
offwhite
in
color
also
had
some
good
lacing
lacing
left
its
marks
with
every
swallow
ale
was
brown
in
color
with
reddish
highlights
very
light
smelling
just
of
some
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
slight
alcohol
smell
tasted
of
chocolate
malt
butter
or
perhaps
butterscotch
had
a
slight
pine
flavor
with
that
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
right
this
is
going
to
be
my
brew
for
superbowl
i
plan
on
staying
home
and
enjoying
a
few
great
choice
for
a
fall
day
i
could
imagine
myself
buying
again
on
a
60
degree
night
d
another
winner
from
bells
even
if
it
isnt
in
its
upper
tier
still
a
good
one
to
go
to
for
brown
ale
lovers
drinkability
is
decent
as
the
sweet
buttery
taste
mat
become
overwhelming
after
a
few
good
drinkablility
tasty
enough
to
enjoy
throughout
an
evening
enough
alcohol
to
act
as
a
social
lubricant
yet
low
enough
alcohol
to
not
destroy
you
a
good
albeit
on
the
high
end
session
beer
notes
great
wellbalanced
brown
nothing
over
the
top
everything
in
balance
great
beer
to
get
someone
to
move
from
pales
to
something
with
more
character
d
a
wellputtogether
brown
ale
good
sessionability
good
flavor
without
being
too
complex
or
demanding
drinkability
somewhat
more
a
typical
brown
ale
than
anything
i
cant
detect
much
that
distinguishes
this
otherwise
d
drinkability
was
ok
but
the
flavors
would
not
make
me
want
to
have
it
often
about
my
least
favorite
bells
beer
so
far
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
another
great
one
from
bells
oh
how
i
wish
they
were
available
here
in
the
great
beer
desert
of
texas
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
bells
i
brought
back
will
definitely
pick
up
more
of
this
the
next
time
im
in
indy
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
a
little
light
brown
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
smelled
malty
but
not
too
strong
really
had
a
nice
medium
body
and
good
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
really
good
a
malt
kick
but
its
not
something
more
some
sort
of
spiciness
perhaps
that
really
makes
a
nice
finish
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
not
sure
why
i
took
so
long
to
try
this
one
of
bells
but
im
glad
i
finally
did
drinkability
suffers
from
lack
of
taste
beer
was
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
had
a
dark
brownweak
coffee
color
with
a
foamy
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipated
smells
like
roasted
malts
yeast
and
nuts
flovour
is
heavy
on
malts
and
nuttiness
some
hints
of
yeast
and
bread
in
there
too
goes
down
easy
had
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
right
before
and
the
bells
best
brown
seemed
way
less
interesting
average
drinkability
for
me
on
this
one
d
drinkability
is
good
not
doubt
its
sessionable
pours
a
solid
brown
with
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
small
mocha
head
sticks
around
for
a
bit
smells
of
chocolate
and
a
earthy
nutty
bready
kind
of
thing
going
on
tastes
malty
chocolaty
faint
bread
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
creamy
body
is
a
little
thin
carbonation
on
the
low
side
great
little
sessionable
brown
ale
pours
a
dark
copper
brown
with
a
somewhat
small
head
aroma
is
very
light
toasty
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
has
a
nice
malty
character
with
just
a
slight
background
sweetness
toasty
and
a
bit
bready
some
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
easily
drinkable
overall
a
very
solid
and
pleasant
brown
ale
overall
hmmm
a
very
well
balanced
creamy
and
delicious
brown
ale
not
a
bad
beer
not
sure
i
would
get
again
but
wouldnt
deny
a
free
one
d
fine
enough
once
again
certainly
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
id
say
broad
appeal
just
not
a
stand
out
brown
ale
for
me
perhaps
my
palate
has
changed
in
time
as
i
try
more
and
more
beers
and
ive
moved
on
from
the
brown
ale
style
not
sure
if
thats
it
ill
have
to
try
more
beers
to
be
sure
i
could
by
this
stuff
by
the
case
a
wonderful
winter
beer
tasty
but
just
the
slightest
bit
too
big
to
be
an
endlessly
sessionable
beer
but
it
is
really
easy
to
knock
off
not
only
a
glass
of
this
stuff
but
a
couple
bottles
as
well
could
definately
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
no
matter
the
season
very
tasty
nice
sweetness
that
doesnt
overwhelm
dont
get
one
get
the
6
pack
youll
wish
you
had
more
than
one
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
i
do
think
there
are
several
components
that
could
have
been
better
but
as
expected
bells
produced
another
good
beer
and
i
will
drink
it
again
definitely
tasty
and
sessionable
a
good
spin
on
the
brown
ale
style
and
a
solid
fall
seasonal
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
wanting
to
switch
nice
flavor
and
low
abv
makes
this
one
very
sessionable
d
very
drinkable
a
nice
representation
of
an
english
brown
ale
nice
sessionable
beer
finally
after
reviewing
several
beers
from
quickly
scribbled
notes
its
time
to
review
beer
thats
sitting
in
front
of
me
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
orange
highlights
with
lots
of
suspended
particles
and
a
tan
head
that
recedes
slowly
leaving
some
above
average
lacing
lightly
toasted
malt
aroma
backed
up
by
some
toffee
and
caramel
notes
and
slightly
fruity
a
faint
metallic
aroma
is
in
the
background
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
nose
some
light
toffee
flavors
light
fruitiness
some
caramel
and
faintly
metallic
medium
mouthfeel
leaving
a
little
to
be
desired
not
a
bad
brown
ale
but
pretty
onedimensional
notes
from
102305
d
i
used
to
drink
this
on
draft
when
i
lived
in
indiana
and
it
is
nice
to
see
this
brown
ale
out
in
the
mid
atlantic
region
good
brownie
by
bells
aroma
is
of
delicate
caramel
and
toasted
dark
malt
lighter
brown
pour
with
a
sizable
light
tan
head
and
spotty
lacing
rich
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
slightly
creamy
and
oh
so
smooth
this
is
a
pleasant
easy
drink
good
malt
flavor
lightly
hopped
sweet
malts
with
a
nutty
affect
good
dose
of
caramel
with
a
sprinkling
of
coffee
recommended
for
everybody
this
beer
should
easily
appeal
to
all
medium
body
with
a
crispdry
finish
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
left
over
from
the
caramel
malts
after
drinking
several
very
hopped
up
beers
this
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
its
smooth
malt
dominate
beer
it
smells
like
a
day
in
the
forest
and
looks
like
a
pile
of
freshly
raked
leaves
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
am
sad
to
drink
the
last
of
them
d
a
very
nice
brown
ale
almost
bordering
on
a
porter
i
was
able
to
drink
a
few
d
very
easy
going
down
good
everyday
drinker
the
beer
is
smooth
and
has
no
taste
of
sour
hops
are
evident
the
mouthfeel
is
not
overly
heavy
yet
not
crisp
it
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
if
you
can
find
this
one
give
it
a
shot
even
if
you
dont
like
say
new
castle
brown
ale
overall
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
that
doesnt
overdo
things
it
is
light
and
airy
but
gets
the
job
done
a
solid
english
brown
from
the
folks
at
bells
easy
to
drink
after
a
long
day
overall
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
its
not
as
complex
as
others
that
ive
tried
but
it
does
what
it
does
very
well
worth
a
shot
its
a
hazy
medium
shade
of
brown
with
no
head
on
it
it
smells
like
carmel
and
biscuits
it
is
light
and
refreshing
but
there
is
a
certain
thickness
to
it
that
hides
well
an
odd
sweetness
sticks
out
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
it
is
also
a
spicyness
to
it
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
drinkability
as
solid
an
english
brown
as
ive
ever
had
definitely
bells
best
brown
at
least
abv
is
reasonable
and
fine
for
the
style
its
really
not
that
great
i
made
a
homebrew
that
i
tasted
side
by
side
and
mine
was
similar
but
better
my
friend
agreed
in
a
blind
taste
test
this
stuff
is
good
but
id
rather
drink
goose
island
nut
brown
but
im
still
enjoying
it
even
as
im
in
the
middle
of
a
summer
heat
wave
highly
recommended
to
those
who
like
brown
ales
disappointing
it
does
follow
with
a
nice
charcoal
toffee
taste
though
i
detect
midland
cabonation
and
find
it
to
be
very
drinkable
theres
a
hint
of
orange
and
chocolate
nuttiness
bitter
grassy
hops
in
the
back
the
hops
tend
to
dominate
toward
the
end
as
is
the
case
most
of
the
time
but
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer

overall
this
feels
a
bit
of
a
hybrid
of
an
english
pale
ale
and
a
brown
ale
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
floral
hop
bitterness
upfront
and
finished
with
a
good
roasted
character
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
thats
sort
of
a
catchall
this
could
work
in
a
wide
variety
of
situations
whether
you
wanted
something
bitter
or
malty
and
this
could
pair
with
a
lot
of
different
foods
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
had
a
decent
light
brown
color
with
a
short
head
not
too
bad
for
a
spring
beer
decent
flavor
with
decent
body
not
too
much
flavor
goes
down
easy
and
was
very
nice
to
drink
but
nothing
too
spectacular
as
i
was
expecting
more
ogreat
flavor
great
balance
and
a
good
beer
o
my
favorite
brew
so
far
from
saint
arnold
and
probably
my
favorite
beer
to
date
it
isnt
bad
chilled
but
you
get
a
much
more
rounded
experience
after
it
warms
slightly
overall
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
browns
personally
but
this
one
is
ok
not
really
anything
special
in
my
opinion
o
solid
brown
ale
nothing
especially
great
or
earthshattering
but
very
good
beer
to
try
if
you
come
across
it
i
wouldnt
target
this
as
a
must
buy
its
a
very
good
beer
cheers
malty
and
bready
really
makes
me
recall
why
they
call
beer
liquid
bread
nice
sweetness
with
a
dryer
than
expected
finish
overall
an
average
representation
of
an
english
brown
ale
worth
a
try
id
pick
it
up
every
now
and
then
rjt
poured
from
the
bottle
the
beer
was
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
the
aroma
was
a
slightly
tinny
malty
scent
in
others
words
it
smelled
kind
of
like
the
inside
of
a
brewery
the
initial
taste
was
a
smooth
malty
sweetness
with
note
of
chocolate
and
toasted
nuts
the
aftertaste
was
a
slightly
sour
wheat
with
a
medinelike
quality
at
times
that
stays
nicely
on
the
back
of
the
throat
the
moderate
thickness
and
low
carbonation
aided
the
staying
power
that
was
even
equipped
with
a
slight
warming
sensations
overall
this
is
a
pretty
middleoftheroad
brown
ale
nothing
is
spectacular
about
it
yet
it
is
very
drinkable
even
though
the
appearance
is
very
average
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
brown
ale
it
manages
to
be
fairly
dark
and
sweet
without
having
an
overpowering
taste
of
chocolate
or
coffee
might
be
going
into
my
regular
rotation
liked
the
label
story
about
saint
arnold
the
bishop
of
metz
nice
rich
milk
chocolate
sweetness
was
coming
through
and
really
sweetining
it
up
there
was
then
some
hints
of
caramel
malts
in
the
back
coming
up
and
really
letting
you
know
this
was
a
sweet
little
brown
ale
the
next
flavor
rocking
on
the
nose
was
some
subtle
coffee
notes
and
tons
of
earthy
grains
sugary
caramel
and
some
light
chcocolate
notes
are
predominant
here
with
a
nice
touch
of
earthy
grains
making
up
the
backround
very
nicely
somel
ight
hints
of
wood
and
vanilla
come
through
as
it
warms
up
and
really
deepen
the
profile
while
keeping
it
sufficiently
light
the
finsi
hwas
dry
as
could
be
at
first
but
no
hint
of
hops
at
all
a
very
sweet
dry
finish
smell
is
like
a
caramel
like
and
sweet
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
maybe
coffee
or
chocolate
feels
very
smooth
and
rich
as
it
goes
down
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
overall
and
highly
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
non
existent
with
great
flavor
aroma
this
is
a
very
nice
cozy
beer
that
could
be
greatly
enjoyed
on
a
cold
night
watching
the
game
i
will
look
for
this
next
time
im
in
the
states
and
i
give
this
my
recommendation
overall
a
very
light
brown
ale
that
can
only
be
fully
appreciated
when
you
understand
the
region
it
comes
from
houston
is
damn
hot
and
most
of
the
year
it
is
really
hard
to
drink
a
heavy
beer
so
this
is
a
brown
ale
that
is
not
very
heavy
and
actually
very
refreshing
you
could
sit
out
by
the
lake
on
a
90
degree
summers
evening
and
knock
back
a
few
there
are
very
few
other
beers
with
this
kind
of
taste
that
can
be
enjoyed
like
that
so
well
done
saint
arnolds
you
made
a
damn
good
brown
ale
figured
this
would
be
a
good
brew
to
accompany
the
inaugural
episode
of
the
new
season
of
breaking
bad
dunno
why
it
pours
a
clear
garnetrusset
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
light
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
is
pretty
weak
barely
comprising
light
maple
syrup
and
brown
sugar
this
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
taste
amps
up
the
aforementioned
maple
syrup
and
brown
sugar
and
adds
a
light
touch
of
cocoa
light
molasses
green
apple
toffee
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
things
have
definitely
improved
from
the
smell
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brown
something
i
wouldnt
mind
sipping
on
regularly
if
given
the
chance
saint
anrold
brown
ale
poured
a
ruddy
brown
in
my
tulip
glass
the
body
of
the
beer
is
visually
dense
so
i
could
not
see
any
carbonation
the
head
was
about
23
inch
tall
and
off
white
the
smell
is
of
toasty
and
nutty
malts
as
i
taste
it
i
first
get
that
roasted
flavor
followed
by
some
nuttiness
the
finish
includes
a
good
bit
of
earthy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carbonation
was
present
but
not
aggressive
overallsaint
arnolds
seems
to
be
doing
big
things

is

in
a

and
their
adding
a
hefeweizen
on
that
note
the
brown
ale
is
nothing
special
but
is
very
reasonable
and
easy
to
get
could
definitely
drink
4
or
5
of
these
when
im
in
the
mood
d
tasty
brown
ale
but
not
overly
sweet
nice
malty
bodied
with
little
hop
bitterness
i
would
drink
this
brew
again
and
would
recommend
it
this
beer
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
bit
still
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
poured
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
into
a
tulip
glass
this
holds
a
semi
clear
dark
amber
color
that
reaches
for
brown
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
lightly
roasted
nut
and
the
sugared
candyesque
backbone
ive
found
common
with
other
saint
arnold
beers
fills
the
nose
here
with
regards
to
taste
this
carries
the
roasted
malt
character
of
a
brown
ale
but
has
a
distinguishing
sweetness
that
separates
it
from
others
ive
sampled
perhaps
thats
characteristic
to
the
brewerys
yeast
of
choice
all
in
all
this
is
a
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
bright
flavored
treat
with
a
malt
sweet
finish
cheers
d
this
is
quite
the
sessionable
beer
has
a
very
balanced
profile
mixing
sweet
roasty
and
bitter
flavors
everything
seems
to
blend
together
really
well
overall
impression
is
that
of
smoothness
i
cant
really
say
that
i
think
this
is
truly
an
english
brown
ale
color
is
off
hops
are
off
seems
to
be
a
hybrid
of
a
couple
of
american
interpretations
of
style
all
this
being
said
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
as
an
everyday
drinker
well
done
overall
an
interesting
brown
ale
very
hoppy
kind
of
drinkable
but
i
was
a
bit
surprised
with
this
one
d
drinkable
for
an
ale
but
still
couldnt
have
to
many
and
be
comfortable
alcohol
over
5
but
not
a
big
factor
for
me
in
having
another
the
body
was
mediumlight
none
too
thick
the
carbonation
was
lively
keeping
things
moderately
interesting
its
certainly
an
easy
to
drink
pleasant
beer
but
it
could
use
some
extra
spunk
md
didnt
wow
me
with
big
flavors
but
this
went
pretty
good
with
bacon
and
eggs
pours
a
clear
light
orangebrown
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
dried
fruits
taste
is
a
light
grape
flavor
up
front
with
a
toasted
bread
middle
and
a
earthy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
low
carbonation
good
drinkability
a
bit
lighter
roasted
flavor
than
many
brown
ales
but
i
would
drink
this
again
my
motto
beer
is
like
food
you
dont
want
the
same
thing
everyday
and
you
cant
live
without
it
overall
a
simple
and
decent
brown
ale
id
suggest
grabbing
one
if
you
see
it
wow
this
beer
is
really
average
actually
compared
to
most
other
brown
ales
ive
had
its
below
average
i
spent
a
few
days
in
houston
and
the
beer
scene
in
tx
seems
pretty
lackluster
despite
the
fact
i
loved
the
divine
reserve
5
i
think
that
the
warm
tx
whether
tends
to
lighten
the
popular
craft
beers
produced
there
that
thought
neatly
explains
this
particular
beer
it
looks
and
smells
a
lot
like
a
lager
but
does
have
some
dark
roastiness
that
tastes
like
caramel
and
molasses
and
brings
it
into
line
with
other
brown
ales
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
watery
pours
a
clear
light
brown
color
with
a
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
toffee
caramel
malt
and
a
light
nuttyness
the
flavor
is
light
caramel
malts
light
roasted
malts
some
nuttyness
and
a
light
hop
character
the
overall
flavor
is
pretty
sweet
light
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pours
an
amber
brown
not
a
deep
dark
brown
i
was
expecting
with
a
thin
tan
head
foam
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
small
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
malt
caramel
honey
sweetness
similar
flavor
sweetish
caramel
malt
a
touch
bitterness
to
balance
at
the
end
lots
of
carbonation
and
bubbles
but
not
enough
to
maintain
a
head
a
bit
tingling
on
the
tongue
pretty
smooth
easily
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
was
a
ready
hoping
for
when
compared
to
some
other
brown
ales
d
relatively
easy
drinking
but
points
off
again
for
the
lack
of
flavor
spoiling
my
potential
enjoyment
of
this
brew
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
again
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
saint
arnold
is
up
on
the
top
of
my
favorite
texas
brewers
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
very
drinkable
another
accurate
representation
of
its
style
from
saint
arnold
i
really
like
what
this
brewery
is
doing
d
smooth
and
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
different
than
i
expected
after
a
nice
smell
from
this
beer
the
taste
did
not
disappoint
a
slight
bit
of
toasted
malt
breaks
through
the
beer
giving
it
the
brown
ale
taste
not
overpowering
at
all
the
beer
is
light
and
goes
down
smooth
pretty
good
drinkability
all
in
all
has
pretty
good
flavor
isnt
too
high
in
alcohol
content
and
actually
left
me
wanting
another
not
the
best
brown
ale
but
a
pretty
interesting
interpretation
i
would
have
to
say
d
all
in
all
i
will
keep
this
local
favorite
on
hand
for
most
guests
as
it
is
a
peoplepleaser
this
seemed
just
a
tad
more
hopped
up
than
your
traditional
english
brown
but
i
didnt
mind
in
the
least
as
it
brought
a
nice
spiciness
and
needed
balance
to
a
fairly
malty
profile
i
enjoyed
this
had
out
of
a
chimay
glass
pours
kind
of
an
amberbrown
lighter
than
i
had
hoped
smells
like
caramel
slightly
and
a
lot
of
earthy
metallic
hops
theres
a
bit
of
that
caramel
flavor
when
you
taste
it
a
long
with
some
brown
sugar
like
sweetness
the
english
hops
flavor
cleans
it
up
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
id
hoped
but
thats
just
nit
picking
of
their
year
round
offerings
this
is
probably
my
favorite
toasty
and
nutty
this
brown
is
with
a
good
balance
of
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
profile
on
it
is
not
really
doing
it
for
me
though
i
want
my
browns
to
be
chuggably
smooth
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
chocolaty
this
beer
is
none
of
that
it
feels
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
its
not
bad
by
any
means
and
is
a
well
crafted
beer
but
there
are
many
better
browns
out
there
that
are
more
to
my
liking
verdict
saint
arnold
brown
ale
is
just
a
little
thin
for
me
id
love
to
see
a
little
more
oomph
in
the
malt
backbone
but
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
tasty
and
sessionable
little
brew
well
worth
a
try
overall
im
very
pleased
with
this
one
and
for
a
brown
ale
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
as
it
is
one
of
the
better
english
browns
i
have
had
once
again
not
awful
but
nothing
i
would
drink
again
if
there
was
something
else
decent
available
pours
a
clear
reddishbrown
clear
colored
body
with
a
big
creamy
offwhite
colored
head
with
good
lacing
and
lasting
has
a
somewhat
nutty
aroma
some
hops
okay
aroma
nice
malty
nutty
taste
tasty
very
nice
atmosphere
is
ok
but
a
solid
distinctive
nose
does
stand
out
good
balanced
flavor
and
a
subdued
feel
good
quaff
overall
another
great
beer
from
saint
arnolds
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
their
amber
ale
except
with
a
caramel
flavoring
good
beer
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice

creamy
tan

with
some
nice
sticky

follow
the

slight

the

is

malty
slight
smokeroast
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brew
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
but
not
something
i
would
go
to
regularly
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
or
something
good
to
have
with
dinner
not
necessarily
a
oneoff
drink
like
i
had
though
a
worthy
beer
overall
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
smooth
great
session
beer
browns
dont
have
the
blow
you
away
flavor
like
a
hop
bomb
but
they
do
a
lot
with
what
they
have
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
recommend
worthy
of
a
sixer
couple
times
a
year
brown
ale
especially
with
respect
to
flavor
is
on
the
light
end
of
the
style
spectrum
a
little
more
chocolate
malt
might
have
made
it
better
but
its
hard
to
argue
with
the
beer
that
saint
arnold
has
created
under
the
cap
mashtronaut
dont
really
think
id
hunt
this
one
down
again
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
would
recommend
troegs
rugged
trail
drinkability
is
good
on
this
brew
i
can
say
i
have
enjoyed
every
brew
from
these
guys
that
i
have
tried
so
far
d
drinks
quick
and
easy
but
not
much
to
savor
pours
a
dark
amber
that
has
an
bright
orange
tint
when
held
up
to
the
light
doesnt
look
much
like
a
brown
ale
really
the
head
is
small
and
shortlived
and
leaves
a
ring
with
no
lacing
it
doesnt
smell
much
like
a
brown
ale
either
with
a
dominant
candy
apple
sweetness
very
fruity
with
little
dark
malt
or
hop
aroma
at
all
super
sweet
taste
as
well
with
more
caramel
and
toffee
than
the
aroma
suggests
there
is
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
though
not
much
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
unique
take
on
a
brown
ale
though
its
probably
not
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
is
stingy
aroma
is
of
chocolate
malts
and
some
citrusy
hops
smell
is
really
balanced
between
hops
and
malts
taste
shows
more
malt
than
hops
with
some
cocoa
and
some
caramel
with
a
orangey
grapefruity
hop
bite
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
creamyoily
body
is
medium
to
thin
decent
session
brew
looks
a
bit
light
for
a
brown
ale
but
drinks
great
md
a
think
light
to
medium
bodied
feel
decent
carboantion
and
decent
brown
but
nothing
spectacular
not
a
terrible
beer
but
one
that
falls
short
of
interesting
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
not
one
i
feel
compelled
to
buy
again
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
ive
had
there
are
definitely
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
pours
a
rubycopper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
hazlenuts
caramel
and
malt
taste
to
match
quite
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
present
finishes
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
with
decent
drinkability
good
example
of
the
style
just
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
anymore
as
i
tend
to
prefer
the
hoppier
beers
tastemouthfeel
lots
of
malty
caramel
sweetness
but
not
much
of
the
toasted
flavors
that
i
normally
associate
with
brown
ales
mild
malty
sweetness
is
present
throughout
without
a
lot
of
change
in
the
finish
this
is
a
pretty
simple
brew
but
its
not
half
bad
d
vary
tasty
beer
sweet
tasting
with
nothing
really
overly
strong
to
chase
people
away
everyone
should
be
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
d
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
one
that
i
would
really
drink
much
this
is
a
very
offcentered
brew
but
it
is
also
unique
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
could
drink
all
night
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
worth
having
sometime
pours

a

some

touch
the
palate
right
as
a
very
nice
enjoyable
orange
citrus
finish
takes
over
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the

very

great

nice
and
malty
not
much
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fizzy
to
start
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
not
overly
complex
this
brown
is
very
drinkable
i
do
not
buy
this
as
much
as
the
other
saint
arnolds
super
drinkability
near
perfect
a
dang
good
brown
pretty
average
overall
i
use
to
really
like
this
i
tried
it
again
recently
and
either
my
tastes
have
changed
or
the
beer
has
worth
a
try
but
not
very
exciting
smooth
creamy
mouth
adds
to
the
drinkabilty
i
liked
it
d
this
beer
has
become
a
staple
in
my
collection
it
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
anytime
and
it
is
something
that
i
have
been
able
to
get
my
shiner
drinking
friends
to
enjoy
this
will
be
a
brown
i
reach
for
when
im
in
the
mood
for
sure
pours
out
a
dark
copper
much
like
an
esb
with
a
sizeable
head
that
fizzles
out
to
being
thin
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
i
get
minimal
aromas
of
nuts
and
chocolate
with
mostly
just
a
vague
sweet
smell
has
the
typical
weird
saint
arnold
overbearing
fruitiness
honestly
this
tastes
like
a
really
fruity
esb
with
a
little
added
chocolate
malt
and
a
halt
put
on
the
hops
finishes
dry
but
then
feels
cloying
in
the
aftertaste
weird
mouthfeel
is
not
too
weighty
but
the
carbonation
needs
to
ease
up
a
bit
this
isnt
horrible
jus
kind
of
wonky
for
a
brown
ale
drinkability
an
easy
going
down
drinker
i
only
had
a
six
if
it
was
local
i
would
probably
purchase
this
again
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
st
arnold
brown
ale
is
brewed
using
five
different
malts
and
three
different
varieties
of
pacific
northwest
hops
it
is
a
good
tasting
brown
ale
with
a
good
deal
of
complexity
but
a
few
small
problems
prevent
this
beer
from
being
better
it
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
prefer
and
im
not
too
crazy
about
the
traces
of
diacetyl
flavor
take
these
two
small
flaws
away
and
you
would
have
a
world
class
product
still
st
arnold
brown
is
a
beer
worth
trying
it
offers
a
nice
assortment
of
flavors
and
the
chocolate
malt
flavor
is
enjoyable
if
i
said
it
was
brown
youd
be
shocked
im
sure
but
it
is
some
gold
red
tints
but
brown
it
is
the
head
is
tan
thin
the
smell
is
strangely
lacking
maybe
ive
got
it
too
cold
but
i
get
nothing
but
a
thin
metallic
smell
the
taste
is
much
improved
over
the
smell
tastes
of
hazlenut
with
a
dry
finish
not
much
sweetness
in
there
at
all
really
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
has
a
nice
smoothness
to
it
like
a
summer
silk
really
or
not
really
but
whos
counting
drinkability
is
very
good
the
taste
is
well
balanced
the
alcohol
low
enough
at
least
by
my
belgianfavoring
standards
to
qualify
this
one
as
a
session
beer
in
my
book
d
i
do
enjoy
this
brew
but
they
never
have
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
so
im
stuck
to
drinking
it
out
of
the
bottle
plus
none
of
the
bars
here
ever
carry
this
one
typically
just
the
amber
lawnmower
and
seasonal
which
is
disappointing
because
this
is
a
fine
brew
closer
to
an
amber
ale
than
a
brown
ale
fairs
well
but
could
do
with
a
bit
more
kick
or
complexity
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
no
head
and
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
nutty
with
the
flavor
very
much
the
same
nice
medium
mouthfeel
making
the
beer
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
brown
ale
definitely
a
session
ale
drinkability
i
could
knock
a
few
of
these
back
easy
to
drink
pours
kind
of
a
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
is
carmel
like
malt
flavor
taste
is
sweet
malts
carmel
and
some
toasted
malts
hop
bitterness
isnt
prominant
medium
mouthfeel
noticeable
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
enjoy
this
one
but
there
are
better
brown
ales
available
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
is
pretty
good
maybe
just
a
little
on
the
thin
side
good
drinkability
and
certainly
good
enough
for
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
beer
presents
well
and
smells
good
but
bland
comes
to
mind
with
everything
else
there
are
better
brown
ales
out
there
for
the
price
maybe
a
good
session
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
minimal
14
tan
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
orangey
amber
brew
head
is
down
to
swirls
and
rimmed
bubbles
in
moments
with
some
smallbubbled
lacing
aroma
is
hearty
grains
with
a
bit
of
a
fruity
tinge
taste
is
kind
of
damp
cardboard
with
some
malt
notes
and
a
light
fruitiness
in
the
middle
and
close
that
try
to
make
me
forget
the
beginning
mouthfeel
is
okay
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
not
so
great
for
me
would
recommend
most
of
their
other
brews
over
this
one
d
decent
drinkability
the
brown
ale
is
average
at
best
cheers2beers
overall
not
my
favorite
st
arnold
just
a
bit
too
sweet
carbonation
level
seems
too
low
which
gives
an
odd
mouthfeel
and
the
smell
has
traces
of
dms
id
recommend
the
amber
over
this
one
of
saint
arnolds
yearround
brews
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
copperyamber
in
color
fairly
low
carbonation
not
a
lot
of
aroma
fairly
subdued
actually
nice
mellow
malt
flavor
low
hop
bitterness
great
finish
of
caramel
like
sweetness
good
body
for
style
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
might
be
a
tad
sweet
for
a
brown
ale
but
i
find
it
quite
enjoyable
thanks
mushroomcloud
drinkability
is
ok
a
decent
brown
ale
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
worth
a
try
thanks
go
to
txbeer
for
this
one
a
sweet
malt
prescence
is
key
here
but
the
turnoff
is
the
signature
saint
arnolds
dirty
malt
finish
perhaps
a
bit
of
aging
will
help
this
along
fom
the
bottle
poured
and
copper
amber
with
a
medium
sized
off
white
head
aroma
the
molasses
jumped
right
out
there
than
came
the
malts
brown
sugar
chocolate
flavor
a
nice
sweetness
comes
out
with
the
caramel
and
chocolate
and
got
hints
of
malts
and
hops
not
to
bad
pours
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
sits
atop
a
brown
beer
that
shows
a
hazy
ruby
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
fruity
notes
of
cherry
toasted
malt
a
light
astringent
burnt
grain
note
really
the
fruity
note
dominates
though
the
taste
is
light
and
sweet
up
front
with
a
finish
of
stale
malt
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
fruitiness
here
with
notes
of
cherry
dominant
the
finish
is
lightly
phenolic
and
astringent
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
as
well
for
some
reason
this
does
not
jive
with
my
tastebuds
oh
well
a
mediocre
brown
ale
the
taste
was
initially
on
the
sweet
side
but
during
the
glass
moved
to
more
of
a
bland
mediocre
taste
color
was
a
good
dark
brown
and
very
rich
but
the
lack
of
head
makes
the
appearance
average
at
best
like
other
saint
arnolds
beers
its
not
bad
but
not
good
as
ive
said
in
my
other
reviews
of
their
beers
its
cb
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkability
good
stuff
from
st
arnolds
belongs
on
the
short
list
of
st
as
brews
to
try
if
you
visit
the
houston
area
medium
brown
color
and
slightly
cloudy
had
a
thin
head
with
adequate
carbonation
smelled
of
caramel
spice
and
yummy
malt
hints
of
fruit
in
the
nose
tasted
of
smooth
malt
caramel
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
gummy
should
have
brought
some
crackers
or
nuts
like
most
everyone
else
did
finished
with
good
hoppy
dryness
had
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
recommended
this
ale
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
but
is
a
wee
bit
undercarbonated
for
a
brown
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
with
mexican
food
drinking
this
tonight
im
struck
with
how
similar
this
tastes
to
their
christmas
ale
brown
ale
is
copper
in
color
with
typical
for
saint
arnold
a
short
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
spiced
taste
is
much
the
same
maybe
just
a
bit
too
sugary
sweet
this
is
a
good
enough
beer
but
i
think
it
could
be
improved
upon
not
an
exceptional
beer
but
not
unpleasant
one
good
thing
about
beeradvocate
is
its
making
me
go
back
and
try
beers
i
havent
tasted
in
years
like
this
one
makes
a
decent
foodaccompanying
beer
i
think
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
murky
medium
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
dies
off
quickly
there
is
just
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
rich
and
nutty
lots
of
dark
roasted
malt
a
touch
of
hops
in
there
the
taste
has
lots
of
sweet
malt
some
toffee
in
there
with
some
toasted
biscuit
malt
a
nice
flavor
the
body
is
nice
and
thick
yet
smooth
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
a
nice
brown
ale
thanks
again
to
hardtarget
for
the
tasty
treat
still
its
light
and
refreshing
id
drink
this
as
a
summer
beer
and
love
it
this
is
an
inoffensive
beer
that
could
be
a
good
introduction
for
the
macro
brew
drinker
its
pretty
good
but
nothing
i
would
actively
pursue
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
can
imagine
it
being
a
nice
session
choice
thank
you

the

not

only
a

12

ale
i
reviewed
medium
brown

smells
are
noticable
sweet
and
ok
with
me
for
the
style
nice
full
taste
of
molasses
brown
sugar
carmel
malt
not
much
hops
to
notice
if
any
sweet
aftertaste
still
slick
like
the
other
one
but
not
bad
at
all
hints
of
hazelnut
and
corn
syrup
still
light
carbonation
slick
and
watery
feel
lingers
but
better
than
the
amber
i
think
id
like
to
try
something
else
from
texas
next
maybe
the
broken
spigot
imperial
stout
i
give
this
one
another
try
as
well
when
im
sure
of
its
freshness
this
is
another
fine
brew
from
the
gang
at
st
arnolds
if
you
ever
get
to
visit
be
sure
to
look
up
jesse

that
man
loves
his
job
smell
is
sweet
and
almost
caramellike
taste
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
maybe
coffee
or
chocolate
feels
very
smooth
and
rich
as
it
goes
down
an
excellent
american
brown
ale
imho
pours
a
brownish
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
and
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
nose
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
chocolate
the
roasted
malt
and
hops
clearly
come
through
in
the
taste
along
with
notes
of
coffee
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
an
average
to
nice
brown
ale
pours
a
dark
amber
tea
color
with
a
small
tan
head
with
staying
power
and
leaves
a
lace
down
the
glass
it
has
a
sweet
bread
smell
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
burnt
malt
with
a
trace
of
chocolate
and
finishes
thin
with
a
bread
aftertaste
in
this
lightbodied
brew
one
of
the
better
ones
from

cheers
from
texas
pours
a
dark
mahogony
brown
with
a
full
tan
head
that
all
too
soon
vanishes
well
carbonated
with
decent
lace
strong
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
the
flavor
begins
with
some
maltiness
less
than
i
expected
followed
by
coffee
and
bitter
cocoa
flavors
and
a
strong
hop
finish
also
a
bit
watery
not
as
good
as
some
other
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
so
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
to
be
had
this
was
a
disapointing
beer
from
the
getgo
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
and
bigbubble
carbonation
like
a
soda
the
aroma
wasnt
too
bad
with
a
nice
citrusy
hop
presence
a
grapefruitlike
hop
presence
shows
up
first
in
the
flavor
but
then
is
followed
by
a
watery
thinness
that
leaves
you
wishing
there
was
more
to
the
beer
would
have
been
better
as
a
lightly
hopped
pale
ale
instead
of
a
brown
browns
need
more
body
than
this
good
brown
ale
12
oz
bottle
this
beer
is
above
average
molasses
rules
the
day
for
me
a
taste
not
usually
associated
with
a
brown
head
was
huge
4
fingers
on
the
pour
too
much
carbonation
the
head
settles
to
a
5
finger
head
of
thicker
foam
that
lasts
the
finish
of
this
beer
is
not
great
ooh
great
flavor
earthy
roast
toffee
malts
light
roast
coffee
chicory
root
earl
grey
tea
and
a
finishing
minerality
very
easy
to
drink
and
appropriately
tasty
maybe
exceedingly
tasty
for
an
american
brown
mouthfeel
lacks
from
a
blandness
of
low
levels
of
carbonation
and
a
wet
medium
body
zapped
needs
some
chew
or
some
foam
to
cut
through
otherwise
a
brown
ale
that
is
more
than
trustworthy
i
would
go
to
this
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
was
filled
with
flavors
of
nutty
malts
but
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
this
would
make
for
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
burger
if
you
are
looking
to
pair
it
with
a
meal
lacing
still
appeared
on
the
glass
despite
looking
pretty
weak
and
thin
but
the
aroma
and
taste
really
pull
this
one
up
there
is
a
lot
of
caramel
and
semisweet
chocolate
notes
in
this
one
pretty
good
job
of
presenting
the
malt
highlights
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
mahogany
coloring
that
is
vibrant
under
light
with
a
frothy
light
offwhite
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
sparse
coating
aromas
of
rich
nutty
sweetness
with
hints
of
hazelnut
and
almond
very
sweet
on
the
nose
flavors
are
rich
and
sweet
on
a
light
crisp
body
nut
sweetness
is
cut
by
the
beers
body
and
the
roastiness
is
all
that
carries
over
into
the
aftertaste
flavors
fall
off
a
bit
and
there
is
a
semisweet
slightly
watery
finish
to
the
brew
thanks
to
greg
for
this
one
overall
the
only
draw
back
here
is
the
price
since
pittsburgh
doesnt
distribute
these
guys
i
found
the
single
for
3
50
at
the
house
of
1000
it
was
good
but
not
over
3
bucks
a
pop
good
cheers
overall
this
is
an
ok
brown
ale
i
am
not
personally
a
fan
of
browns
but
i
enjoy
this
one
o
i
like
this
beer
it
may
not
be
one
of
the
best
browns
but
it
still
does
the
trick

the
pour
is
a
nice
looking
brown
tone
with
good
clarity
but
little
in
the
way
of
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
tends
to
be
on
the
malty
side
with
the
kind
of
bitterness
more
frequently
associated
with
brown
ales
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
nuttiness
but
mainly
malts
with
a
backup
shaker
of
hops
the
malts
are
key
still
a
nice
enough

a
highly
drinkable

would
be
good

notes

this
is
a
good
looking
solid
american
made
english
brown
ale
it
is
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
it
lacks
the
characteristic
nutty
flavors
and
complexity
of
classic
english
brown
ales
nothing
worth
seeking
out
but
a
good
buy
if
you
see
it
my
sample
is
from
a
22ounce
bottle
purchased
about
a
month
ago
during
a
trip
to
portland
it

not

no

there
is
a
mild
nuttiness
but
nothing
comparable
to

apparent
taste
is
hearty

with
some
light

character
and
finishes
with
a
slight
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
of
sunflower
seeds
odd
but
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth

presentation
22
oz
bottle
a
vigorous
pour
yielded
a
dark
brown
color
with
areas
of
light
red
when
held
to
the
light
large
carbonation
bubbles
rose
to
the
surface
and
a
very
big
foamy
head
billowed
over
the
glass
nice
lacing
a
heaver
malt
smell
was
present
although
a
touch
of
floral
hops
was
evident
after
considerable
wafting
somewhat
plain
simple
smell
to
this
one
the
taste
was
a
deep
malt
with
traces
of
hops
on
the
edges
and
in
the
aftertaste
slightly
better
than
average
for
the
style
full
mouthfeel
from
a
medium
body
a
creamy
texture
was
also
felt
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
overall
a
fairly
good
brown
ale
i
could
have
several
of
these
and
be
happy
not
bad
but
not
awesome
pour
was
a
medium
dark
amber
pretty
clear
big
frothy
head
died
down
but
it
has
taken
it
a
long
time
ive
had
this
beer
in
the
glass
for
well
over
an
hour
and
theres
no
foam
or
froth
left
no
lace
whatsoever
i
can
hear
the
bubbles
popping
as
they
still
come
up
in
the
glass
aroma
is
slightly
toffeelike
with
some
roasted
coffeetype
notes
the
taste
is
where
things
start
to
be
less
than
they
should
i
find
the
mouthfeel
thin
almost
watery
and
theres
some
metallic
notes
as
well
theres
some
maltiness
to
be
found
but
also
an
overabundance
of
small
tight
carbonation
that
wraps
itself
around
your
tongue
theres
also
something
a
bit
off
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
something
else
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
makes
this
just
an
average
micro
maybe
some
kind
of
peanut
or
other
nut
note
that
just
seems
off
not
bad
just
off
a
very
pleasant
brown
ale
in
a
distinctly
british
style
soft
and
mild
with
a
very
drinkable
appeal
that
would
make
for
several
enjoyable
pints
flavorful
with
pleasant
goldings
flavor
when
you
burp
another
superb
beer
from

very
fizzy

lightly

followed
by

some
smoky
flavors
as

taste
followed
by
a
smooth

aftertaste
very
light
hints
of
chocolate
and
nuts
as
well
but
not
sweet
i
cant
get
over
how
clean
this
tastes
but
not
very
impressed
because
it
not
as
complex
as
i
hoped
drinkable
this
ale
has
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
a
thin
beige
head
sits
atop
the
beer
the
aroma
is
of
caramelized
malt
the
flavor
is
initally
of
malt
sweetness
then
a
fizzy
slighlty
roasted
flavor
takes
over
there
is
very
little
discernable
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fizzy
for
the
style
however
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale

is

and
is

after
a

paltry

emerges
and
manages
to
offset

to

it
from
becoming

perceptibly
leafy

is

brew
intermediate

character
between

it
has
the
malt
sweetness
of
an
english
but
the
clean
esterless
character
of
an
american
yeast
strain
nothing
inherently
outstanding
here
but
that
seems
to
be
the
intention
thanks
to
bennybrew
for
the
delivery
from
maine
i
exspected
the
beer
to
come
flying
out
of
the
bottle
when
i
uncapped
it
like
its
namesake
thank
goodness
it
didnt
a
nice
brown
clolor
the
taste
was
semisweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
almost
a
porter
but
not
quite
this
was
quite
a
tasty
beverage
the
taste
was
malt
milk
chocolate
butterscotch
mild
espresso
mild
grapefruit
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
oily
with
light
fizzy
carbonation
it
finished
with

mild

and
light
dry

a

example
of
a

a
good
one
to
give
to
macro
drinkers
looking
to
start
venturing
forth
into

overall
a
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
brown
ale
smooth

malty
without
being
over

heavy
this
brown
ale
is
a

pours
a
dark

with
a
creamy
tan

that
lasts
till
the
end
and
laces
on
the
way
down
taste
is
spicy
with
subtle
roasted
grain
and
bready
flavors
hops
are
rounded
and
in
the
background
but
contribute
to
the
balance
and
drinkability
with
a
smooth

this
is

excellent
beer
my
first
time
with
this
bier
wasnt
sure
about
it
but
was
suprised
at
the
smoothness
and
taste
would
recommend
i
had
it
i
liked
it
i
didnt
think
it
was
over
6
alcohol
in
fact
this
was
my
present
from
my
fiance
when
she
went
to
nola
for
a
bachlorette
party
does
this
mean
she
got
into
trouble
and
is
trying
to
make
me
forget
about
it
by
bringing
me
beer
love
this
one
has
some
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
super
drinkable
a
fine
chewy
brown

toffee
and
molasses
notes
in
here
along
with
some

the
body
is
fairly
smooth
medium

creamy
dry
on

man
this
is
one
tasty
beer
i
like
this
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
liked
this
beer
problem
for
me
was
the
vanilla
porter
i
had
right
before
this
so
my
palate
was
a
little
off
overall
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
id
happily
have
another
one
of
these
great
dark
ale
smooth
and
tasty
i
just
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
and
it
is
amazing
i
have
had
abita
beers
before
and
have
liked
them
fine
but
this
this
is
something
special
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
is
alaskan
amber
so
this
isnt
a
huge
derivation
still
where
can
i
find
a
keg
of
this
nice
dark
beer
not
too
bitter
kinda
heavy
its
a
dark
ale
with
a
good
strong
taste
it
doesnt
have
an
overpowering
flavor
and
its
not
too
heavy
coming
out
of
the
tap
this
was
indeed
an
excellent
beer
but
coming
out
of
the
bottle
it
just
isnt
the
same
in
fact
i
dont
intend
to
waste
my
time
getting
bottles
of
this
theres
only
so
much
time
in
life
for
beer
drinking
and
while
this
is
okay
its
just
not
as
super
fantastic
as
it
was
from
the
tap
whenever
i
go
back
to
that
place
i
always
get
this
though
very
smooth
great
hops
could
have
a
heavier
body
still
a
favorite
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
that
being
said
turbo
dog
is
a
huge
exception
it
reminds
me
less
of
a
brown
ale
and
more
of
a
porter
without
being
too
heavy
and
full
bodied
1010
would
drink
again
great
dark
brown
ale
great
aroma
and
nice
mud
look
tan
head
adds
to
the
color
love
the
toffeechocolate
taste
and
not
bitter
at
all
would
def
drink
this
again
overall
turbodog
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
beers
i
love
the
great
malty
and
sweet
flavors
perfectly
balanced
with
some
slightly
bitter
hops
delicious
see
what
i
did
there
overall
excellent
tasty
brown
ale
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
heard
great
things
about
turbodog
and
went
to
my
local
market
which
has
a
build
your
own
6pack
thing
for
9
99
i
got
a
turbodog
purple
haze
couple
shock
tops
and
a
cherry
chocolate
beer
i
refridgerated
my
turbodog
and
anglestraight
poured
it
into
a
20
oz
mug
the
head
is
incredible
super
retention
very
foamy
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
was
great
hints
of
chocolate
malt
no
cloying
bit
of
sweetness
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
i
drank
the
first
gulp
heaven
no
over
the
top
alcohol
taste
despite
it
having
a
higher
abv
than
most
beers
i
felt
no
biting
carbonation
and
the
sweetness
was
not
overpowering
i
recommend
turbodog
to
everyone
a
o
solid
english
ale
really
balanced
balanced
malt
and
hops
and
an
interesting
aroma
like
red
wine
which
i
find
really
nice
easy
to
drink
and
very
pleasant
poured
out
a
deep
clear
brown
with
a
nice
ruby
tint
the
head
is
foamy
and
settles
in
at
about
one
fingers
worth
light
tan
in
color
and
leaves
some
nice
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
average
with
only
slight
nondescript
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
much
more
robust
with
nice
nutty
notes
and
additions
of
caramel
theres
a
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
but
it
has
an
overall
smooth
mouthfeel
and
finish
a
solid
brown
ale
this
is
a
good
rendition
of
an
english
brown
ale
meets
all
the
criteria
i
didnt
care
for
it
when
i
first
had
it
in
2006
and
i
still
dont
not
my
cup
of
tea
im
not
sure
what
happened
to
this
beer
but
1015
years
ago
it
was
excellent
the
stuff
they
call
turbodog
now
just
does
not
taste
the
same
this
was
the
beer
that
put
abita
on
the
map
but
now
i
find
it
undrinkable
and
lacking
in
the
malty
complexity
it
once
held
the
abita
turbo
dog
was
ok
it
was
not
that
bad
the
taste
was
ok
and
the
smell
was
not
too
bad
this
beer
was
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
was
ok
the
smell
was
ok
as
well
it
was
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
was
worth
trying
i
am
not
one
hundred
percent
sure
of
how
it
tasted
because
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
tried
this
beer
but
i
am
willing
to
try
it
again
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
brown
ale
style
seems
a
little
too
burnt
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
at
a
party
unless
there
were
other
options
but
cant
see
buying
one
of
these
mine
was
a
gift
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
which
is
almost
black
in
color
actually
that
has
a
good
halffinger
beige
head
with
decent
lacing
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
roasted
malts
for
the
most
part
the
taste
has
more
going
on
with
roasted
malts
hint
of
chocolate
toffee
and
coffee
in
the
mix
a
slight
tart
finish
which
is
nice
perfect
carbonation
makes
this
good
brew
more
enjoyable
a
tasty
brew
i
had
a
few
other
styles
of
brew
from
this
brewery
and
all
have
been
good
kept
seeing
this
at
my
fav
bottle
shop
decided
to
go
ahead
and
give
it
a
go
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
brew
it
is
very
malty
and
if
anything
would
go
well
with
a
good
ol
fashioned
bbq
dinner
maybe
even
make
a
good
marinade
with
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
i
bought
not
putting
it
downjust
had
hoped
it
would
live
up
to
the
hype
i
have
experienced
and
price
was
a
little
on
the
high
side
not
the
best
review
i
know
but
was
not
passionate
enough
to
do
it
overall
roasty
hefty
bitter
sweet
not
an
english
brown
ale
at
all
but
too
light
to
be
a
porter
this
is
really
versatile
good
on
its
own
great
with
food
just
a
little
too
dark
for
the
season
early
summer
i
look
forward
to
returning
to
this
in
the
fall
pretty
much
spot
on
for
american
dark
brown
ale
the
closest
thing
i
have
mind
to
compare
this
to
is
great
lakes
edmund
fitzgerald
but
less
roasty
or
bitter
than
glef
and
much
sweeter
o
not
very
complex
but
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
pretty
standard
brown
ale
nothing
spectacular
here
but
decent
a
decent
beer
lots
of
malt
but
the
balance
seems
to
be
a
little
out
for
my
taste
o
it
has
some
nice
warm
caramel
notes
but
wasnt
dark
or
full
enough
to
make
it
a
worthy
stout
this
one
would
be
great
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
a
solid
take
on
a
brown
ale
good
biscuity
malt
presence
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
the
flavor
was
good
but
it
could
have
stranded
out
a
little
bit
more
very
drinkable
tho
i
would
have
this
again
turbo
dog
is
a
good
beer
with
no
real
defects
that
i
can
see
its
just
an
average
but
good
beer
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
with
well
hidden
alcohol
not
complex
but
very
enjoyable
overall
i
really
love
this
one
from
abita
excellent
flavor
look
and
aroma
o
if
you
like
sweet
dark
beers
with
minimal
hopping
this
one
is
for
you
overall
it
is
an
great
and
balanced
beer
smell
is
nice
and
clean
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
carbonated
and
adequately
full
not
too
sweet
bitter
or
dark
but
a
good
balance
of
all
three
fairly
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
got
a
growler
full
of
it
o
so
far
my
favorite
abita
low
abl
so
its
kinda
like
a
dark
sweet
session
beer
nice
change
up
if
you
are
getting
hopped
out
while
there
are
better
representations
of
this
style
this
beer
is
typically
a
great
value
pick
ive
had
pecan
harvest
from
abita
and
thought
it
was
decent
and
i
feel
the
same
about
this
beer
its
a
decent
brew
that
is
interesting
enough
to
warrant
maybe
drinking
a
couple
of
but
thats
about
it
theres
a
nice
caramelchocolateroast
combination
going
on
with
a
fairly
high
carbonation
that
makes
turbodog
an
easy
drinker
but
nothing
made
me
too
excited
about
it
i
must
say
im
shocked
the
bros
gave
this
a
90
rating
because
its
almost
the
very
definition
of
an
average
beer
to
my
taste
buds
hey
different
strokes
id
have
it
again
if
offered
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
a
pretty
average
brown
ale
thats
not
alltoo
satisfying
but
hey
the
price
is
right
brown
bottoms
up
pours
out
dark
as
night
and
certainly
darker
that
i
would
expect
a
brown
ale
to
be
has
a
nice
brown
two
finger
head
and
thats
being
conservative
definitely
some
nice
lacing
here
too
smell
is
much
more
like
a
brown
ale
with
some
nice
mellow
malts
a
little
sweetness
and
a
tiny
smell
of
hops
but
no
bitterness
this
is
more
malt
forward
too
be
sure
on
the
nose
taste
is
quite
malty
as
in
the
nose
with
the
sweetness
i
found
in
the
nose
but
really
nothing
i
can
taste
from
the
hop
bill
this
is
just
your
basic
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
actually
quite
thick
or
more
so
than
i
expected
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
so
to
be
honest
i
might
not
be
the
best
to
rate
this
beer
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
anything
overwhelming
in
taste
smell
etc
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
however
this
is
close
to
style
but
just
not
anything
special
the
feel
is
good
though
the
medium
body
goes
somewhat
thin
at
times
and
while
crisp
later
it
starts
off
just
fizzy
it
does
smooth
out
and
it
goes
semidry
from
beginning
to
finish
overall
an
excellent
tasting
beer
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
12
oz
bottles
from
my
local
grocery
store
and
they
are
clearly
marked
with
a
freshness
date
from
the
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
out
pours
a
dark
brown
ale
with
a
mahogany
hue
swirling
the
tan
head
around
the
glass
reveals
a
thin
sticky
lacing
a
good
inhale
detects
notes
of
a
dark
crystal
malt
in
a
brew
of
caramel
chocolate
dark
fruits
kiwi
fig
prune
or
plum
and
a
hops
spice
the
taste
has
a
rich
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
darkstickysweet
malty
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
are
dominant
with
a
light
crisp
hops
bitterness
that
cleanses
the
pallet
to
profile
this
english
brown
ale
its
not
far
off
from
todays
stouts
and
porters
very
similar
to
a
full
sail
session
black
without
the
liquorice
or
a
distant
relative
of
samuel
smith
nut
brown
ale
one
that
lives
just
down
the
road
i
had
this
quite
a
few
times
years
back
when
i
was
in
texas
so
when
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
today
i
just
had
to
grab
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
brown
with
bodacious
ruby
highlights
and
a
huge
crop
of
fluffy
tan
head
aromas
of
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
earth
and
toffee
the
flavor
is
a
bit
fruity
with
english
yeasty
esters
dominating
caramel
toffee
and
chocolate
maltiness
off
set
with
a
hint
of
earthy
hop
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
creamy
bubbly
mouthfeel
i
was
worried
that
my
palette
may
have
changed
in
all
these
years
but
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
english
style
ale
overall
cant
believe
i
hadnt
tried
this
to
date
as
it
is
a
classic
american
craft
beer
in
the
minds
of
many
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
worth
trying
and
honestly
one
of
abitas
better
offerings
its
an
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
light
and
crisp
enough
to
enjoy
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
certainly
not
lacking
in
complex
flavor
o
a
solid
english
brown
that
doesnt
get
boring
after
a
few
pints
m
very
creamy
and
smooth
nice
on
the
tongue
o
not
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
out
there
but
its
a
good
session
beer
if
youre
craving
something
darker
had
this
with
a
very
spicy
pizza
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
dark
almost
opaque
color
with
mild
carbonation
a
decent
head
that
did
not
last
very
long
but
very
nice
lacing
i
noted
more
toffee
than
chocolate
notes
in
aroma
and
taste
also
a
noticeable
roasted
malt
flavor
this
is
a
good
malty
ale
right
in
line
with
other
stouts
and
porters
i
would
buy
it
again
overall
a
nicelyconstructed
brown
ale
that
achieves
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
i
feel
it
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
flavor
up
front
but
its
not
bad
at
all
a
good
ale
to
make
a
stew
with
dark
almost
opaque
color
with
mild
carbonation
and
decent
head
toffee
and
chocolate
notes
in
aroma
very
carbonated
with
a
noticeable
roasted
flavor
perhaps
carbonated
too
much
not
much
depth
or
complexity
but
it
is
an
ale
chocolate
malt
notes
also
in
summary
a
malty
ale
its
flavors
would
be
better
suited
to
a
stout
or
porter
overall
a
good
solid
brown
ale
nice
balance
very
balanced
brown
ale
not
sweet
with
pleasant
coffee
notes
good
exemplar
of
its
style
its
a
pretty
average
brown
ale
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
or
unexpected
but
is
definitely
pleasant
and
sessionable
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
pours
a
chocolate
brown
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
dissipated
quickly
toffee
notes
are
present
in
the
nose
the
upfront
flavor
is
bready
and
malty
with
a
mildy
bitter
finish
this
offering
is
enjoyable
but
only
above
average
as
english
browns
go
o
a
unique
hybrid
between
an
amber
and
brown
ale
having
disticnt
flavor
characteristics
from
both
clearly
a
popular
beer
which
fills
a
nice
niche
and
is
available
nation
wide
a
solid
offering
from
abita
o
not
terrible
but
the
flavors
dont
quite
mesh
and
the
metallic
taste
is
a
definite
turnoff
oddly
this
beer
paired
very
well
with
chocolate
covered
marshmallow
easter
candy
o
overall
its
a
really
good
beer
some
of
the
flavors
arent
as
pronounced
as
they
smell
and
roasted
bitterness
dominates
overall
it
might
even
be
a
bit
too
bitter
but
it
is
a
tasty
mellow
beer
its
not
something
id
rave
about
but
i
would
like
to
drink
it
again
poured
dark
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
mocha
head
aroma
of
caramel
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
flavor
is
of
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
not
very
hoppy
which
is
a
plus
not
real
complex
but
a
good
flavor
none
the
less
to
me
this
is
a
good
solid
dark
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
to
put
it
in
the
superior
category
overall
a
deep
but
not
overly
complex
brew
the
hops
are
understated
in
the
presence
of
the
rich
coffee
flavor
o
a
good
brew
from
abita
that
i
used
to
think
more
of
but
after
revisiting
it
a
few
times
its
not
as
great
as
i
once
thought
it
was
still
for
the
price
its
a
good
choice
i
really
like
this
beer
definitely
a
go
to
beer
for
a
fall
or
winter
day
o
based
on
guidelines
this
beer
straddles
northern
southern
english
brown
characteristics
and
the
drinker
is
the
winner
a
very
smooth
mellow
yet
robust
beer
great
balance
of
sweet
and
roasted
malts
if
you
crave
a
brown
and
this
is
available
give
it
a
go
overall
not
a
bad
beer
worth
a
try
but
pretty
average
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
overall
a
good
session
beer
and
a
solid
example
of
this
style
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
tasted
like
all
the
things
i
enjoy
about
ipas
without
the
crazy
bitterness
the
taste
had
hints
of
chocolate
and
toffee
which
makes
it
ideal
for
a
dessert
beer
ill
probably
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
to
enjoy
after
meals
in
the
very
near
future
aromas
of
chocolatey
malt
with
some
nuttiness
some
sweet
molasses
as
well
taste
is
moderately
toffee
sweet
fairly
dry
in
the
finish
with
just
the
slightish
bit
of
astringency
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
with
somewhat
simple
but
nice
flavor
a
better
newcastle
gave
this
to
a
friend
that
was
a
big
newcastle
fan
and
now
he
has
switched
to
this
o
a
decent
brown
ale
that
is
easy
drinking
hops
are
nice
and
the
blend
was
well
done
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
a
great
weekend
beer
to
run
through
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no

dating
pours
slightly
hazy
dark

overall
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
malt
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
great
balance
and
extremely
drinkable
nothing
is
overbearing
which
makes
it
highly
sessionable
chestnut
colored
decent
maltiness
but
just
a
rather
bland
beer
very
little
going
on
here
nothing
offensive
just
boring
like
many
other
abita
beers
its
the
standard
run
of
the
mill
beer
that
doesnt
offend
yet
theres
nothing
spectacular
about
it
i
wouldnt
call
it
complex
but
this
beer
has
a
lot
to
offer
great
sessionable
englishstyle
ale
chocolate
and
toffee
make
an
intriguing
combo
not
exactly
used
to
it
an
enjoyably
easy
twelveouncer
to
slam
back
between
other
beers
o
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
sweet
and
some
nice
fruit
to
it
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
mind
blowing
but
could
revisit
at
a
bar
with
not
a
lot
of
craft
options
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
noticing
a
deep
almost
opaque
reddishbrown
color
and
a
modest
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
of
foam
but
i
left
the
room
for
a
minute
right
after
pouring
when
i
returned
i
was
welcomed
back
to
my
seat
by
a
wave
of
rich
caramel
sweetness
unfortunately
the
wonderful
sweetness
somehow
seemed
to
evaporate
with
the
head
and
my
first
deliberate
smell
of
the
beer
yielded
nothing
but
dull
combination
of
mild
lactoselike
sweetness
some
musty
hops
and
an
afternote
of
dry
cocoa
the
flavor
is
marginally
better
but
still
sadly
bland
with
a
light
sweet
blend
of
milk
chocolate
and
a
mildest
noticeable
toffee
character
although
each
characteristic
seems
to
develop
nicely
as
the
beer
warms
the
texture
is
good
enough
with
a
nice
medium
body
that
is
lightened
by
a
fine
carbonation
overall
although
certainly
drinkable
the
superficial
flavor
profile
leaves
much
to
be
desired
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
mostly
just
boring
and
bland
bottom
line
id
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
brown
with
two
fingers
thick
tan
colored
head
settles
to
a
quarter
inch
leaving
a
spray
of
lace
behind
smell
not
much
going
on
mild
herbal
and
earthy
hopping
mild
nuttiness
and
bakers
chocolate
not
unpleasant
just
not
enough
there
taste
somewhat
nutty
and
tannic
pecan
seems
closest
toffee
into
an
earthy
and
very
slightly
citric
hopping
with
some
vague
fruitiness
then
a
fleeting
hit
of
dark
chocolate
towards
the
finish
body
is
light
feel
is
cottony
slick
and
not
terribly
pleasant
at
the
end
of
the
sip
the
pale
malt
base
is
almost
the
only
thing
left
which
is
disappointing
as
there
are
some
decent
things
going
on
here
best
by
313
a
good
brew
nothing
special
but
definitely
drinkable
somewhat
one
dimensional
o
the
ultimate
in
inoffensive
beer
theres
nothing
bad
or
good
here
really
it
just
exists
in
the
market
place
like
white
bread
exists
in
a
grocery
store
and
money
no
object
would
you
rather
have
white
bread
or
the
artisanal
9grain
stuff
thought
so
overall
all
in
all
a
boring
beer
nothing
stands
out
here
nothing
to
really
write
about
just
a
standard
brown
beer
bland
i
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
again
i
would
drink
it
though
for
free
overall
a
decent
brew
has
a
great
semibitter
taste
but
easily
could
be
sessionable
very
light
no
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
that
is
smooth
and
balanced
on
all
fronts
it
doesnt
grab
your
palate
and
brutalize
it
it
just
allows
you
to
experience
and
have
a
good
time
this
beer
is
the
perfect
dessert
beer
creamy
yet
light
i
ate
a
slice
of
pound
cake
while
i
sipped
this
beer
and
found
myself
smiling
right
up
til
the
last
drop
overall
i
found
it
was
a
good
beer
i
didnt
find
it
mind
blowing
by
any
standard
but
it
was
a
solid
dark
ale
would
buy
again
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drive
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
this
is
pretty
good
had
it
in
a
stein
poured
from
a
bottle
the
initial
appearance
is
very
very
dark
almost
opaque
with
a
red
tint
the
smell
was
lacking
but
that
could
just
be
me
the
taste
is
at
once
very
strong
with
a
bitter
bite
only
to
immediately
smooth
out
into
a
really
delicious
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
especially
nice
with
strong
carbonation
in
a
tight
space
almost
reminiscent
of
dr
pepper
overall
a
fantastic
beer
over
all
a
fitting
beer
for
the
style
it
represents
but
nothing
rave
about
it
this
brew
poured
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
which
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
body
was
a
dark
brown
with
moderate
visible
carbonation
on
it
the
nose
had
notes
of
coffee
even
aly
picked
this
up
and
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
on
the
brew
was
almost
exactly
like
the
nose
except
the
coffee
overwhelmed
the
other
flavors
a
bit
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
were
detectable
but
definitely
took
back
seat
to
the
coffee
the
finish
lingered
with
the
coffee
flavor
the
body
was
moderately
thin
decently
carbonated
and
the
alcohol
was
obviously
on
the
lower
end
as
i
sipped
the
beer
i
may
have
gotten
a
hint
of
sweetness
as
well
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
detect
this
was
a
very
flavorful
brown
ale
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
wood
polish
brown
mixed
with
orange
and
red
hues
good
webbed
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
the
nose
is
nutty
offering
up
notes
of
toffee
crisp
too
and
turbodogs
flavor
is
nutty
as
well
nutty
with
a
side
of
graininess
a
kiss
of
hops
and
a
vague
crispness
with
a
lighter
medium
body
this
ends
up
as
a
respectable
working
mans
brown
ale
this
is
my
first
beer
from
abita
it
pours
up
a
nice
deep
brown
with
a
fluffy
two
finger
caramel
head
there
is
decent
retention
and
plenty
of
lacing
the
nose
is
roasted
barley
bread
nuts
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
full
with
the
carbonation
not
at
excessive
levels
taste
basically
follows
the
nose
i
detect
toffee
cola
licorice
chocolate
coffee
and
some
bready
qualities
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
and
not
a
tremendous
amount
of
hoppiness
for
a
beer
of
this
nature
but
definitely
a
satisfying
beer
im
looking
forward
to
some
more
of
abitas
offerings
a
nice
beer
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
i
like
the
nutty
chocolate
character
served
too
cold
which
probably
explains
the
lack
of
appreciable
aroma
flavor
saves
this
beer
brings
out
a
distinctiveness
and
decent
taste
served
at
a
proper
ale
temp
may
bring
about
a
better
rating
but
a
good
enough
beer
as
presented
and
liked
it
then
im
sure
the
quality
and
potential
for
a
more
favorable
impression
remains
ill
have
to
review
it
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
over
all
this
was
a
solid
brown
with
some
high
drinkability
it
seemed
more
like
an
entry
level
brew
but
definitely
well
crafted
and
very
tasty
turbodog
the
bottle
says
turbodog
is
a
dark
brown
ale
brewed
with
pale
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
and
willamette
hops
this
combination
gives
turbodog
its
rich
body
and
color
and
a
sweet
chocolate
toffeelike
flavor
somewhat
thin
for
the
scent
not
quite
watery
but
wish
it
were
a
bit
heavier
still
this
is
one
i
could
offer
friends
willing
to
try
a
dark
beer
that
actually
has
flavor
im
not
a
big
abita
fan
but
id
pick
this
one
up
again
for
sure
very
easy
drinking
tasty
english
brown

it

dark

a

malty

close

an
interesting

but
misses
the
mark
light

and
low
abv
ok
but
not
noteworthy
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
welcome
again
im
glad
to
have
found
a
bit
of
lousiana
up
here
in
maine
and
wouldnt
mind
trying
some
other
products
of
abita
o
not
great
but
quite
good
a
solid
english
style
brown
ale
the
flavors
balance
well
with
none
overpowering
id
certainly
pick
up
another
pack
as
long
as
its
reasonably
priced
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
it
has
a
nice
slightly
sweeter
flavor
and
a
good
mouthfeel
onot
a
bad
brew
would
definitely
get
it
again
overall
this
is
really
quite
a
pleasant
beer
a
different
take
on
an
english
brown
ale
that
really
holds
up
something
i
would
definitely
seeks
out
again
served
from
tap
into
an
rj
rockerscribbs
kitchen
shaker
poured
a
dark
redbrown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
milk
chocolate
powdered
chocolate
cream
and
very
subtle
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
milk
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
cream
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
it
was
really
nice
what
i
found
going
on
in
the
aroma
in
this
one
however
i
was
disappointed
with
the
flavor
that
i
found
as
it
was
nowhere
near
as
complex
as
the
aroma
while
the
aroma
was
complex
it
still
wasnt
in
the
next
tier
for
the
style
worth
trying
if
you
are
in
a
pinch
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
out
at
a
bar
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
quite
sessionable
what
it
lacks
in
aggressive
flavor
it
makes
up
for
in
lively
mouthfeel
this
might
just
be
abitas
best
and
i
would
gladly
drink
this
beer
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
start
my
day
it
has
all
the
qualities
of
drink
anytime
anywhere
beer
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
buttery
biscuit
toffee
middle
it
has
the
round
fullness
of
flavor
that
you
would
expect
from
a
big
beer
with
a
lighter
abv
finishes
with
a
dry
plumb
flavor
winelike
o
one
of
my
favs
that
reminds
me
easily
of
new
orleans
and
hot
weather
and
bar
hopping
in
the
french
quarter
this
is
a
nice
solid
beer
that
i
turn
to
whenever
its
on
tap
not
overdone
in
any
one
realm
its
beautifully
balanced
excellent
drink
still
it
is
a
nice
quaff
for
anyone
subject
to
the
swampy
louisiana
summers
oi
actually
like
this
much
more
than
most
brown
ales
i
think
it
would
be
better
at
about
1
less
alcohol
oda
nice
beer
something
anyone
could
enjoy
mellow
but
still
flavorful
enough
to
not
be
a
bore
o
i
love
a
brewery
that
has
a
unique
flagship
i
mean
come
on
an
english
brown
ale
and
one
thats
done
well
respect
abita
respect
poured
from
bottle
into
glass
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
nich
bubble
head
smells
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
maybe
somewhat
nutty
taste
is
deff
of
sweet
caramel
malts
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
slight
nutty
flavor
its
a
very
good
brown
not
the
most
amazing
but
a
great
brew
to
end
my
stay
in
louisiana
one
thing
to
say
about
abita
in
general
people
in
louisian
love
their
local
brew
while
options
are
very
limited
here
i
think
its
great
how
loyal
they
are
with
abita
and
how
top
shelf
they
are
regarded
here
cheers
nola
othis
beer
is
great
with
a
good
steak
off
the
grill
i
will
buy
it
again
overall
these
beer
gos
great
with
wild
game
roasting
on
an
open
flame
great
for
camping
the
bottom
line
is
that
if
you
are
visiting
louisiana
and
dining
on
a
spicy
seafood
dish
you
should
wash
it
down
with
this
local
product
i
am
away
a
lot
and
i
never
feel
like
ive
arrived
back
home
until
i
can
get
this
into
gut
overall
another
somewhat
watered
down
like
flavor
from
an
abita
beer
i
think
the
flavor
and
aromas
of
their
beers
are
fairly
good
but
they
lack
on
the
bodymouthfeel
of
their
beers
d
a
very
nice
session
brew
a
solid
offering
from
abita
o
i
found
the
turbodog
to
be
a
delightful
beer
and
one
of
the
strongest
in
abitas
normal
lineup
its
a
tasty
sweet
beer
one
that
i
would
recommend
overall
a
decent
flavour
and
very
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
or
different
just
a
standard
well
made
english
brown
i
would
probably
reach
for
something
else
next
time
in
hopes
of
finding
something
extraordinary
interesting
brew
like
a
hybrid
between
a
dry
irish
red
ale
a
malty
english
porter
and
an
american
brown
ale
its
got
a
little
something
for
everyone
pours
a
flat
looking
brown
color
with
just
the
slightest
amber
glow
to
it
minimal
off
white
head
smells
malty
and
sweet
english
malts
milk
chocolate
bittering
hops
only
flavor
is
really
strange
because
of
all
the
malts
in
here
its
sweet
above
all
else
but
it
isnt
heavy
its
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
but
could
probably
stand
a
bit
more
carbonation
went
pretty
well
with
a
smoked
brisket
sandwich
but
its
not
howd
i
would
classically
define
an
english
brown
ale
at
all
oa
nice
little
brown
ale
drinks
more
like
a
winter
seasonal
to
me
though
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
nothing
horrible
about
it
however
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
dynamic
all
the
pieces
seemed
to
be
there
but
nothing
stood
out
color
was
amazing
and
the
flavors
that
did
come
through
fit
the
style
it
just
seems
like
it
could
have
been
more
pronounced
o
nice
a
bit
more
agressive
than
others
in
the
class
but
not
overly
so
o
i
had
this
beer
during
mardi
gras
2012
it
made
me
feel
in
the
spirit
as
i
paired
it
with
some
jambalaya
a
sessionable
brown
ale
with
pronounced
chocolate
flavors
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
and
a
slight
nuttiness
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
brown
with
an
abundant
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
chocolate
malt
and
toffee
the
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
come
through
theres
some
bitterness
and
herbal
flavor
of
the
hops
which
helps
balance
this
beers
flavor
profile
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
average
which
helps
this
beer
drink
very
well
this
was
always
one
of
my
favorites
from
abita
and
it
still
is
this
is
an
excellent
beer
tasty
enough
as
a
session
ale
but
not
one
id
look
for
either
d
an
interesting
profile
but
a
bit
lacking
for
richness
and
depth
but
then
that
does
go
along
with
it
being
easy
to
drink
i
am
not
sure
it
is
really
cult
following
worthy
but
it
is
a
fairly
nice
little
brown
if
somewhat
different
overall
drinkability
definitely
a
great
beer
classic
fruity
english
aroma
and
flavor
but
with
a
bit
more
american
heft
more
roast
more
chocolate
more
body
and
even
some
american
hops
like
a
newcastle
on
steroids
lower
carbonation
medium
body
and
just
the
right
intensity
of
flavor
make
this
super
drinkablesessionable
delicious
brown
id
probably
put
it
over
downtown
brown
i
dont
prefer
this
as
a
goto
brown
nothing
is
terribly
unique
but
it
does
the
job
drink
very
drinkable
the
lightness
of
an
english
brown
with
the
robust
flavors
of
a
stout
i
figure
it
would
be
great
as
a
session
beer
o
the
best
abita
brew
i
have
had
a
true
brown
ale
and
a
nice
refreshment
after
a
good
trail
ride
on
the
mtn
bike
oa
decent
brown
ale
with
nothing
that
really
stands
out
o
good
brown
ale
nothing
is
bad
about
it
but
very
little
is
great
would
try
again
overall
a
somewhat
bold
and
flavorful
brew
that
has
a
slightly
spicier
and
more
aggressive
northwest
american
hop
profile
than
the
typical
uk
version
overall
an
ok
drinkable
beer
not
one
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
good
brew
to
wash
down
a
mess
of
steamed
crawdads
or
some
jambalaya
doa
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
appearance
with
the
following
aroma
being
quite
inviting
and
warm
ultimately
the
beer
is
pleasant
and
warming
itself
but
it
lacks
a
punch
and
depth
of
flavor
that
we
expected
easy
to
drink
beer
pairs
well
with
dinner
lighter
than
expected
from
appearance
nothing
too
impressive
but
one
looks
more
impressive
to
others
with
this
darkish
beer
a
satisfying
english
brown
ale
nothing
to
get
superexcited
about
but
not
bad
overall
a
bold
robust
full
tasting
brew
that
had
just
a
light
hint
of
hops
which
offset
everything
rather
nicely
in
most
natural
viewing
situations
this
brew
appears
black
clear
deep
brownamber
if
you
play
sherlock
motha
fuggin
holmes
smell
was
sweet
chocolatey
and
the
like
taste
was
also
initially
sweet
with
some
earthy
essence
coming
in
at
the
end
mouthfeel
seemed
thin
overall
enjoyed
this
beer
much
will
partake
again
d
its
o
k
but
not
at
all
one
id
have
again
c
o
a
good
sessionable
brown
ale
with
nice
malty
and
earthy
notes
not
overly
bitter
and
relatively
smooth
overall
a
decent
english
brown
sessionable
even
better
on
draft
helped
make
the
red
beans
and
rice
pretty
tasty
i
took
notes
on
my
phone
so
im
not
writing
this
as
i
drink
it
d
exemplary
brown
ale
and
one
full
of
flavor
and
not
watery
for
this
style
it
remains
interesting
throughout
and
beckons
one
to
try
more
o
a
nice
session
beer
my
first
abita
i
was
impressed
id
much
rather
spend
a
little
more
and
get
the
similar

my
opinion

i

it

i
wouldnt

it
was

nothing

this

for

first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
was
down
in
new
orleans
at
a
place
called
mollys
i
wonder
if
its
still
there
this
was
several
years
ago
i
was
so
happy
to
be
able
to
drink
a
local
beer
and
always
remembered
it
when
i
saw
it
at
the
store
this
weekend
i
picked
it
up
and
recalled
that
time
unfortunately
this
beer
may
have
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
a
little
longer
than
i
would
have
hoped
it
didnt
taste
as
fresh
as
the
first
time
i
had
it
too
bad
i
remember
loving
it
but
this
one
may
have
traveled
in
the
heat
up
here
and
it
lost
a
bit
of
quality
in
the
transport
the
coffee
seems
to
come
through
more
when
drinking
than
it
had
in
the
aroma
and
there
is
still
a
decent
roasted
malt
quality
to
it
the
aftertaste
is
a
light
sweet
dry
which
was
pretty
good
itself
a
pretty
good
brown
beer
o
my
favorite
beer
from
abita
rich
creamy
and
simple
with
moments
of
intriguing
complexities
notes
much
darkerroasted
than
i
was
expecting
a
lot
like
a
porter
fairly
balanced
with
the
sweet
and
bitter
quite
chocolatey
and
roasted
on
the
taste
i
thought
it
was
fine
but
not
something
i
would
normally
get
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
id
order
it
again
for
sure
overallvery
drinkable
and
satisfying
brown
ale
nothing
about
this
beer
says
turbodog
to
me
so
i
have
no
idea
where
that
name
came
from
and
quite
frankly
its
a
pretty
big
turnoff
it
sounds
like
some
sort
of
alcoholic
energy
drink
made
to
compete
with
red
bull
vodka
or
something
anyway
the
twinge
of
hop
bitterness
here
almost
made
me
think
i
had
a
secret
esb
on
my
hands
but
layer
after
layer
of
malts
suppresses
it
too
much
still
despite
the
awful
name
this
is
a
rich
smooth
and
likeable
beer
the
rest
ive
had
this
on
tap
quite
a
few
times
and
now
that
im
reviewing
it
from
a
bottle
not
in
a
bar
i
dont
like
as
much
as
i
though
i
did
its
a
decent
beer
but
its
a
bit
too
chalky
to
be
a
good
brown
ale
drank
from
pilsner
glass
appearance
is
very
dark
with
a
carmel
colored
head
that
starts
out
about
two
fingers
thick
than
slowly
dissapates
to
lacing
around
the
edge
has
a
very
weak
smell
for
the
dark
appearance
taste
a
slight
vanilla
and
for
some
reason
i
get
a
smoky
after
taste
which
i
couldnt
think
of
anything
to
compare
it
to
its
a
very
smooth
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
a
brown
ale
overall
not
a
bad
beer
very
happy
i
tried
this
but
not
something
i
will
be
looking
to
order
again
anytime
soon
basically
just
becuase
there
wasnt
really
that
wow
factor
thanks
to
sully
for
sending
this
to
me
nice
brownish
head
of
about
two
inches
and
wonderful
lacing
deep
brown
colour
smells
wonderful
like
a
mocha
chocolate
float
taste
is
great
too
but
not
less
filling
full
bodied
and
creamy
and
malty
sweetness
with
some
bitter
smoothing
still
feeling
the
coffee
and
chocolate
in
flavour
overall
a
nice
beer
better
than
most
english
brown
ales
much
more
complex
and
striking
thanks
mike
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
lower
carbonation
and
medium
body
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
but
with
nice
flavor
o
went
well
with
a
meal
and
was
pretty
solid
all
around
above
average
o
a
good
brown
ale
worth
keeping
around
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
m
light
body
light
to
moderate
carbonation
extremely
well
balanced
quaffable
and
very
tasty
brown
brew
the
best
abita
has
to
offer
turbodog
pours
darker
than
most
browns
with
a
thick
mat
of
bone
colored
whip
drying
chocolate
malt
is
front
and
center
giving
it
a
character
more
in
line
with
english
porter
dark
fruit
and
burnt
sugar
form
the
backbone
while
hops
are
mostly
earthy
and
balance
the
malt
evenly
the
english
brown
tag
seems
a
bit
off
but
this
a
nice
everyday
drinker
and
great
value
thanks
abita
for
the
best
before
dating
probably
one
of
the
best
offerings
one
can
enjoy
from
abita
this
brew
pours
up
a
deep
dark
chocolaty
brown
body
and
sports
a
rich
foamy
tancolored
head
scents
of
espresso
caramel
roasted
malts
and
even
those
of
a
well
aged
bourbon
flavors
of
slowroasted
coffee
dark
chocolates
and
bits
of
toffee
also
mixed
in
this
complex
brew
are
dark
fruits
akin
to
plums
o
im
a
huge
abita
fan
for
what
it
is
solid
entry
level
craft
beer
im
knocking
this
beer
some
points
because
the
smell
isnt
what
it
could
have
been
and
the
inital
intense
sweetness
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
around
8
99
for
a
sixer
tough
to
beat
for
a
decent
craft
beer
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
disappointing
taste
from
the
abita
brands
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
red
cranberry
hues
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
head
is
pillowy
thick
and
khaki
colored
smells
of
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
there
is
also
a
slight
cookie
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
with
burnt
coffee
smoke
a
bitter
dark
chocolate
the
beer
is
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
caronation
is
soft
and
it
has
a
nice
bitter
finish
overall
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
it
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
people
who
arent
used
to
dark
beers
since
its
definitely
not
intimidating
or
overwhelming
overall
this
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
without
much
to
think
about
lightless
brown
hue
with
offwhite
head
that
disappears
aroma
stands
out
beautifully
hazelnut
chocolate
cinnamon
and
brown
sugary
earth
smooth
flavors
of
hazelnut
cocoa
cinnamon
vague
caramel
and
a
lingering
brown
sugar
cookie
note
with
ever
so
light
tang
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
great
english
brown
pick
this
one
up
overall
a
solid
decent
brown
ale
not
the
fullest
of
dark
beers
but
a
good
transition
beer
if
youre
wanting
to
get
into
darker
beers
o
when
i
turned
21
this
was
the
darkest
beer
i
had
ever
set
eyes
on
now
its
a
great
brown
and
one
id
love
to
have
in
the
fridge
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nowhere
near
the
elite
of
the
style
still
a
worthy
and
tasty
brew
from
my
notes
turbodog
was
my
favorite
beer
for
years
and
years
until
i
learned
the
joys
of
hops
and
american
brown
ales
still
ill
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
the
brew
not
the
bestlooking
pint
dark
brown
with
a
cheap
fizzy
head
nose
is
slightly
sweet
with
solid
chocolate
notes
and
turbodog
doesnt
hold
the
same
mystique
of
flavor
now
unfortunately
but
the
requirements
for
a
solid
brown
ale
do
show
up
chocolate
and
a
mild
coffee
bite
modest
bitter
finish
with
subtleties
of
mocha
and
hops
thin
texture
hinders
the
malts
not
my
favorite
anymore
but
still
worth
the
occasional
roll
in
the
hay
o
i
can
almost
always
find
this
in
six
packs
and
i
enjoy
a
darker
beer
often
so
this
is
totally
drinkable
ive
drank
through
the
rest
of
six
pack
on
another
night
its
a
very
good
beer
and
abita
hasnt
dissapointed
me
yet
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
little
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
think
lace
around
the
edge
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
some
dark
fruits
coming
threw
the
taste
starts
of
of
some
dark
fruits
like
plums
or
figs
then
it
gets
a
nutty
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
overall
this
is
a
ok
beer
i
was
bored
and
this
beer
has
been
in
the
store
for
a
year
i
bet
but
can
find
a
date
not
to
bad
wonder
what
it
taste
like
fresh
pours
black
which
is
good
had
a
stale
taste
so
from
that
i
like
it
not
a
bad
taste
or
smell
so
try
it
not
hoppy
its
dark
and
i
ilke
it
overall
impression
good
english
brown
ale
im
used
to
american
brown
ales
so
this
was
fantastic
to
try
a
mild
brown
ale
the
nutty
flavor
was
great
in
this
beer
and
really
enjoyed
a
little
tough
on
the
drinkability
but
i
finished
the
rest
after
my
meal
chicken
and
bean
nachos
its
a
pretty
well
rounded
ale
very
enjoyable
not
a
beer
id
probably
buy
but
a
fairly
well
made
example
ofthe
style
o
this
was
a
gateway
beer
for
me
always
like
this
guy
for
the
memories
o
abita
was
my
entry
into
craft
beer
and
this
was
my
favorite
offering
from
them
for
a
darker
beer
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
can
sit
a
little
heavy
after
4
or
5
while
i
dont
drink
this
as
much
as
i
used
to
its
always
nice
to
revisit
what
peaked
your
interest
into
the
hobby
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
my
hats
off
to
the
craft
brewers
down
there
in
louisiana
o
an
easy
drinker
when
diggin
for
browns
this
is
a
pretty
good
choice
there
are
better
out
there
but
this
is
worthy
of
a
pint
glass
i
like
this
one
but
im
not
entirely
sure
how
often
id
drink
it
if
it
was
a
little
less
roasty
id
probably
like
it
a
bit
more
drinks
a
bit
like
a
chocolate
stout
honestly
which
i
like
but
still
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
still
cant
decide
if
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
maybe
i
should
give
this
one
another
shot
again
sometime
this
beer
has
a
good
bit
of
flavor
but
in
my
opinion
could
use
more
alcohol
not
just
because
i
like
beers
that
are
strong
but
because
a
beer
of
this
style
i
think
would
do
better
in
higher
ranges
of
alcohol
that
alcohol
needs
to
be
there
tell
some
flavors
to
take
a
step
back
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
but
can
feel
light
from
sip
to
sip
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
can
leave
you
scratching
your
head
trying
to
really
understand
where
this
beer
is
placed
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
its
nice
and
smooth
and
quite
sweet
but
is
balanced
enough
not
to
make
one
sick
of
it
too
quickly
not
an
incredible
brown
ale
but
a
very
good
one
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
where
it
would
probably
be
even
more
flavorable
so
im
disappointed
for
the
style
body
is
lacking
and
for
10
bucks
a
six
pack
after
you
get
past
the
initial
smell
that
promises
good
things
to
come
you
realize
youve
been
had
dont
get
me
wrong
you
can
easily
put
away
quite
a
bunch
of
these
but
the
same
thing
can
be
said
of
lots
of
decent
beers
that
cost
less
d
overall
i
was
surprized
by
this
beer
didnt
think
it
would
be
that
good
but
i
really
liked
this
was
a
tad
watered
down
but
not
too
much
and
had
alot
of
nice
flavors
comming
through
and
is
very
drinkable
for
even
beer
noobs
will
get
this
again
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
if
you
want
something
dark
and
different
but
dont
want
a
heavy
stout
in
my
opinion
it
resmbles
more
of
a
porter
get
it
if
you
want
something
tasty
but
not
something
too
heavy
pours
black
with
a
small
tan
head
smells
of
malts
roasted
malts
smells
alright
taste
is
pretty
smooth
malts
of
a
brown
ale
good
balance
of
sweetness
as
in
not
too
sweet
and
just
a
touch
of
bite
in
the
finish
decent
i
guess
has
good
carbonation
and
a
relatively
thin
mouthfeel
really
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
nice
alterative
to
the
bmc
flowing
around
bourbon
street
not
great
but
decent
and
doable
pretty
much
the
definition
of
average
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
on
the
outer
edges
average
tan
head
that
produces
a
pleasant
earthy
roasted
caramel
and
malty
aroma
laces
the
glass
nicely
flavor
is
rich
with
some
tasty
malt
toffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavors
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
to
balance
the
sweet
malt
average
finish
light
to
medium
body
its
a
little
watery
but
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
beer
wow
i
have
been
passing
this
brew
by
for
so
many
yearsim
really
glad
i
finally
tried
it
nice
take
on
the
classic
english
brown
ale
via
louisiana
pours
a
very
pretty
dark
brown
with
reddish
notes
nice
offwhite
head
that
produced
some
slight
lacing
but
lasted
the
whole
glass
the
scent
of
the
beer
is
malt
some
burnt
sugar
light
hops
and
coffee
the
taste
of
the
beer
mimics
the
nosewith
a
bit
more
nicely
balanced
bitternesstouch
of
sweetness
malt
is
definitely
dominate
i
get
nice
coffee
cola
cocoa
notes
on
the
palate
all
this
being
said
its
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
one
that
even
a
lighter
beer
drinker
may
enjoy
if
you
have
been
passing
it
by
try
it
turbodog
may
put
a
smile
on
your
face
o
better
than
any
commercial
mass
production
beer
but
ive
tasted
a
lot
of
better
brown
ales
12oz
bottle
at
the
dish
in
ormond
beach
fl
review
from
notes
taken
shortly
after
tasting
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
two
fingers
of
beige
head
which
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
ring
a
couple
spots
of
lacing
line
the
footed
pilsner
glass
smell
and
taste
are
toast
milk
chocolate
roasted
nuts
toffee
caramel
mild
coffeelike
bitterness
slightly
watery
finish
with
a
vanishing
aftertaste
almost
no
hops
this
is
a
malty
hohum
brown
ale
with
a
mediumcreamy
mouthfeel
its
quaffable
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
needs
a
big
addition
to
the
malt
profile
to
find
its
way
back
to
my
fridge
o
not
very
impressed
by
this
one
i
get
what
they
were
trying
to
do
but
it
feels
like
they
need
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
to
pull
this
one
off
its
a
bit
fizzy
and
sodalike
but
it
goes
down
easy
a
drinkable
brown
ale
for
sure
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
as
great
12
ounce
bottle
best
by
812011
bought
as
a
single
at
world
market
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
with
an
inch
frothy
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
roasted
malt
toffee
bittersweet
chocolate
and
some
nuts
and
coffee
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
except
that
theres
a
bit
of
hops
noticable
in
the
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
smooth
with
good
carbonation
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
6
pack
of
this
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
i
enjoyed
it
its
one
of
the
better
abita
brews
ive
had
o
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
with
nice
balance
highly
drinkable
and
the
spicy
notes
really
add
some
character
to
this
ale
mouthfeel
is
slightly
on
the
dry
side
with
a
light
carbonation
that
acidiclly
cuts
through
the
sweet
grains
despite
a
lack
of
flavor
hops
it
sure
feels
like
there
are
some
bittering
hops
after
each
sip
i
feel
like
i
am
loosing
a
layer
of
enamel
on
my
teeth
a
solid
brew
not
my
favorite
but
a
good
drinker
and
one
id
have
again
and
again
color
is
a
good
transparent
brown
with
a
good
malt
back
bone
in
the
flavor
some
light
hops
in
the
mix
turbodog
has
a
good
following
i
havent
been
able
to
really
understand
it
i
like
the
fact
that
abitas
flagship
brew
is
a
brown
ale
and
not
a
lager
or
pale
ale
i
think
that
says
something
for
them
ill
need
to
try
this
brew
again
sometime
though
because
the
one
and
only
time
i
had
it
i
hadnt
chilled
it
fully
and
it
was
a
little
on
the
warm
side
yet
o
easy
drinking
for
sure
nice
intro
to
better
beer
then
bmc
a
bit
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
man
i
havent
had
this
since
my
passport
at
chumleys
back
in
my
purdue
days
i
wonder
how
ill
receive
it
now
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
brown
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
toffee
biscuit
grass
and
light
flowers
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
mild
combo
of
toffee
and
biscuits
then
strikes
hard
and
fast
with
strongerthanbefore
grass
flowers
orange
peel
and
cedar
its
all
a
bit
much
with
the
nicer
malts
getting
drowned
out
by
a
blunt
herbal
bitterness
but
in
its
defense
things
never
get
truly
out
of
hand
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
little
brown
not
necessarily
something
i
would
readily
reach
for
but
also
not
something
i
would
cringe
at
if
offered
me
medium
body
thick
and
creamy
like
a
lighter
stout
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
i
dont
think
its
the
most
traditional
but
its
still
good
notes
turbodog
is
a
medium
bodied
brown
and
quite
flavorful
while
it
lacks
slightly
on
the
nose
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
rocksolid
example
of
this
particular
style
this
is
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
evening
or
with
a
rich
meal
i
would
come
back
for
more
what
i
liked
most
about
this
brew
was
how
it
managed
to
have
a
good
deal
of
dark
flavors
but
still
be
somwhat
light
on
its
feet
making
it
a
great
pair
for
cajun
cuisine
it
poured
a
brilliant
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
finger
offwhite
head
which
clung
somewhat
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
rich
with
malty
flavors
of
baked
peach
light
roast
coffee
and
peanut
butter
cup
while
the
palate
was
lightlymedium
boded
with
a
rich
dark
malt
character
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
pecan
and
a
nice
balance
of
hops
finish
is
moderate
with
more
chocolate
and
molassas
notes
finish
coffee
lingers
with
the
hoppy
bitterness
still
in
the
cheeks
d
i
could
knock
down
a
few
of
these
happily
pretty
nice
balance
of
everything
here
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
amberbrown
crystal
in
color
with
middensity
tan
colored
head
aromas
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
dark
molasses
characteristics
bold
flavors
of
dark
roasted
coffee
with
some
chocolate
highlights
and
semisweet
toffee
flavors
also
the
brew
is
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
and
the
flavors
remain
very
crisp
slight
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
with
a
reasonably
quick
finish
smooth
and
tasty
this
one
is
easy
going
down
d
i
love
turbodog
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
enjoys
a
good
alcohol
beverage
and
who
doesnt
want
that
this
is
a
well
done
dark
dessert
beer
and
expect
that
while
drinking
it
ill
be
honest
english
browns
arent
generally
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
as
it
were
but
this
is
very
well
done
subtly
balanced
nice
sweetness
without
being
cloying
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
without
it
being
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
s
slightly
sweet
finish
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
first
review
with
the
new
kitties
in
the
house
i
could
hear
them
pattering
around
upstairs
in
their
room
color
is
a
very
dark
brownishred
bordering
on
burgundy
the
tan
head
was
thin
only
about
one
fingers
width
and
faded
quickly
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
scent
of
cocoa
was
weak
but
nice
i
had
to
take
a
few
good
sniffs
to
full
catch
it
the
taste
was
much
the
same
quite
malty
with
cocoa
raisin
and
subtle
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
or
herbal
taste
i
dont
care
for
carbonation
was
mild
enjoyable
but
nothing
outstanding
going
on
here
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
nothing
really
special
but
decent
for
the
price
considerably
drinkable
sessionable
d
this
is
my
3rd
abita
from
a
holiday
variety
pack
this
one
drinks
nice
and
easy
i
like
it
the
best
so
far
d
very
simple
seems
like
i
would
be
able
to
have
a
couple
of
these
final
notes
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
rich
sweet
and
malty
with
just
a
touch
of
sourness
and
bitterness
to
keep
things
interesting
ill
be
coming
back
for
more
verdict
not
too
bad
but
certainly
not
very
interesting
worth
a
shot
but
like
the
other
abita
i
had
falls
short
of
the
competition
be
wary
c
2
95
o
a
pretty
lackluster
brew
nothing
about
it
makes
me
want
to
have
another
one
ive
had
it
from
the
bottle
and
now
on
tap
and
neither
have
been
to
my
liking
im
moving
on
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
reddish
translucence
and
a
quickly
fading
head
aromas
are
of
nuts
stale
coffee
chocolate
wet
cardboard
and
slightly
rotten
potatoes
coffee
comes
through
strongly
as
a
flavor
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sourness
to
it
that
compliments
the
earthy
flavors
still
it
is
a
bit
thin
and
doesnt
really
go
anywhere
ive
become
addicted
to
abita
lately
with
restoration
being
my
favorite
but
this
is
the
complete
opposite
of
the
spectrum
for
me
its
ironic
because
this
was
the
first
abita
beer
i
heard
about
but
im
really
not
impressed
yeah
its
drinkable
for
a
brown
ale
especially
only
coming
in
at
5
6
abv
means
i
could
have
a
couple
without
it
getting
too
heavy
would
probably
pass
in
the
future
for
something
i
enjoy
a
little
more
overall
a
very
clean
and
unidimensional
schwarzbier
it
drinks
and
sessions
well
and
nothing
else
d
this
is
a
case
of
a
beer
being
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
find
it
again
if
i
were
ever
down
around
them
there
parts
drinkability
if
you
enjoy
the
taste
which
might
be
asking
a
lot
the
turbodog
might
make
a
good
session
beer
with
an
almost
complete
lack
of
flavor
and
a
low
alcohol
content
this
brown
ale
wont
be
meeting
my
friends
anytime
soon
notes
it
had
been
such
a
long
time
that
i
just
felt
compelled
to
revisit
it
when
i
first
came
to
the
us
years
ago
this
was
one
of
the
easily
available
and
enticing
brews
that
seemed
to
be
out
of
the
mainstream
at
the
time
pretty
beer
uneducated
and
in
that
context
it
also
shares
for
me
some
of
that
iconic
micro
status
all
in
all
it
is
something
that
having
a
choice
id
probably
wont
revisit
in
a
long
while
but
it
remains
pretty
drinkable
and
all
kinds
of
decent
id
always
welcome
it
crossing
my
path
again
as
i
move
through
the
south
or
elsewhere
in
the
future
d
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
the
first
half
had
disappeared
almost
before
i
noticed
however
the
noticeable
alcohol
which
came
out
as
it
warmed
limits
the
overall
experience
fourthbeer
potential
average
as
there
are
many
brown
ales
with
more
body
but
for
a
light
closer
this
might
do
the
trick
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
the
thinness
of
it
hurts
this
beer
the
most
im
not
expecting
it
to
have
stoutlike
qualities
but
at
times
it
seemed
like
water
overall
though
its
a
everso
slightly
above
average
brown
ale
ill
reach
for
some
oak
pond
first
if
i
get
a
craving
for
the
style
an
ok
brown
ale
smells
better
than
it
tastes
i
love
the
english
brown
ale
as
with
most
of
my
contemporaries
my
first
introduction
to
the
genre
was
with
newcastle
and
as
such
i
base
most
comparisons
of
ebas
on
that
beer
that
being
said
this
one
shines
above
newcastle
its
more
flavorful
and
similarly
priced
given
the
choice
i
would
choose
turbodog
from
now
on
over
newcastle
while
serious
beer
drinkers
may
be
slightly
underwhelmed
with
this
beers
showing
it
is
undoubtedly
a
phenomenally
balanced
beer
it
would
be
a
great
almostsession
brew
for
a
dark
beer
lover
or
a
great
intro
brew
for
the
dark
beer
skeptic
feels
medium
in
body
with
an
oily
slickness
except
the
brew
leaves
the
palate
a
little
dry
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
finally
gave
this
one
a
try
this
beer
finishes
a
bit
dry
and
lingers
on
the
palate
but
in
a
good
way
good
balance
over
all
a
must
try
for
any
beer
drinker
drinkability
is
solid
multiples
would
be
easy
had
this
beer
at
my
brothers
and
i
know
that
i
have
seen
these
sit
on
shelves
at
bevmo
for
a
while
here
so
it
is
very
possible
i
just
had
one
that
was
past
its
prime
would
try
fresh
and
rereview
if
possible
drinkability
above
average
i
found
it
quite
good
overall
drinkability
is
above
average
as
i
wouldnt
mind
putting
away
a
couple
of
pints
of
this
in
a
sitting
i
just
wish
there
there
was
a
bit
more
oomph
to
it
but
im
not
going
to
fuss
so
much
over
it
a
solid
drinkable
brew
from
abita
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
decent
level
of
carbonation
very
solid
offering
cheers
the
mouth
is
a
little
abrasive
at
first
but
quickly
mellows
along
with
the
taste
edit
gave
this
another
try
saturday
at
luckys
pub
downtown
and
i
swear
it
tasted
like
watered
down
hot
chocolate
word
to
the
wise
never
judge
a
beer
on
how
it
tastes
when
youre
already
drunk
dark
reddishbrown
color
a
moderate
tan
head
with
noticeable
carbonation
roasty
malts
in
the
aroma
a
tinge
of
chocolate
but
mostly
burnt
coffee
which
was
kind
of
a
turn
off
taste
full
of
dry
cocoa
and
burnt
coffee
not
too
appealing
somewhat
thin
and
highly
carbonated
bitter
burnt
aftertaste
overall
not
very
drinkable
due
mainly
to
the
burnt
taste
and
subsequent
unpleasant
aftertaste
12

lasting

roasted

flavor
begins
with
espresso
and

but
ends
as
spoiled

may
be
it
was
a
bad
bottle
not
sure
if
i
will
try
it
again
d
id
say
soso
a
good
beer
but
the
bitterness
overshadows
the
malts
in
a
disappointing
way
poured
a
big

head

took
quite
a
while
to
dissipate
but
when
it
did
hardly
left

and
held

and
taste

the
finish
is
a
pretty
long
caramel
ride
really
quite
the
quality
beer
for
the
reasonable
price
turbodog
is
a
dark
hazelnut
color
with
crimson
highlights
the
head
is
a
half
inch
thick
has
good
retention
and
leaves
ample
lacing
the
appearance
is
fabulous
the
aroma
is
mild
containing
malt
subtle
sweetness
and
an
earthy
scent
the
beer
is
very
malty
with
minimal
if
any
hop
bitterness
definitely
in
accordance
with
the
style
the
beer
is
simple
and
straightforward
with
no
detectable
flaws
or
shortcomings
the
feel
is
full
bodied
especially
given
the
low
alcohol
content
of
the
beer
i
had
no
problem
enjoying
two
pints
of
this
brew
i
have
never
had
it
in
the
bottle
so
i
cant
vouch
for
it
there
but
served
fresh
and
on
draft
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
d
nothing
impressive
earthy
taste
brings
drinkability
down
easy
enough
to
drink
but
would
prefer
not
to
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
seems
a
bit
1dimensional
decent
price
snagged
6
for
9
bucks
d
theres
a
bit
tartness
in
this
originally
that
i
found
detracted
from
the
beer
although
it
definitely
improves
as
the
beer
warms
my
first
impression
which
stood
out
through
the
entire
bottle
was
a
toffee
carmel
flavor
with
just
malted
edge
to
it
that
was
nice
and
though
i
thought
it
would
it
failed
to
turn
bitter
at
any
point
the
bottle
was
sevred
up
nice
and
cold
and
this
bottle
went
down
nice
and
quick
a
perfect
change
of
base
beer
for
a
nice
day
drinkability
average
not
as
much
to
be
savored
in
the
flavor
as
some
of
the
herbed
or
flavored
varieties
not
what
i
expected
from
a
dark
brown
ale
too
straightforward
to
be
quaffed
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
nice
two
fingered
tan
head
with
some
light
lacing
aromas
of
grainy
sweet
malts
predominated
the
entire
sampling
on
the
palette
burnt
molasses
semisweet
chocolate
and
malt
with
a
slight
metallic
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
nothing
to
write
home
about
for
this
brew
this
beer
pours
a
nice
mahogany
with
twinges
of
orange
a
decent
frothy
beige
head
this
smelled
of
some
nice
malty
orange
and
hints
of
the
hops
peek
through
but
are
drowned
out
by
the
stronger
chocolate
malt
notes
the
taste
is
notably
lackluster
not
by
any
means
bad
but
there
is
hints
of
roast
and
im
fairly
certain
i
can
taste
the
water
in
this
beer
which
i
dont
find
normal
for
a
brown
ale
as
you
may
figured
out
this
beer
by
proxy
seems
watery
to
me
all
things
considered
this
is
still
a
good
beer
and
if
it
was
given
to
me
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
it
its
a
very
unimpressive
beer
but
solid
for
its
style
something
about
that
combination
of
mineralitybitterness
and
lack
of
sweetness
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
12
ounce
stubby
bottle
really
dark
brown
color
bordering
on
black
nice
off
white
head
with
some
good
amount
of
foam
as
well
good
lacing
aroma
is
okay
decent
mouthfeel
with
light
bitterness
and
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
darned
good
it
starts
with
toasted
malts
followed
by
light
bittersweet
chocolate
with
earthy
hop
character
in
the
background
enjoyable
and
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
american
brown
that
ive
had
i
was
hoping
to
feel
the
exhilaration
of
spooling
up
to
2
5
bars
and
being
launched
into
next
week
by
some
greyhound
of
the
future
but
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
lofty
for
an
english
brown
either
way
the
name
seems
irrelevant
and
the
beer
is
good
but
forgettable
still
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
pleasure
to
drink
yes
sir
i
like
it
english
browns
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
find
this
one
very
well
done
more
flavorful
than
most
not
a
huge
beer
but
tasty
could
definitely
see
repeat
performances
my
favorite
from
the
regular
abita
lineup
quite
drinkable
the
beer
has
a
creamy
carb
but
very
light
body
finish
is
sweet
with
a
touch
of
lingering
soy
sauce
a
good
beer
for
a
college
boy
but
not
the
best
brown
ale
for
a
working
man
pours
that
dark
and
tepidly
translucent
brown
of
a
brown
ale
nice
tan
foamy
head
smell
is
like
a
song
of
sweet
dark
malts
very
nice
first
taste
is
blended
ohsowell
nutty
with
a
twang
of
hops
at
the
end
carbonated
beautifully
well
finish
is
smooth
as
pudding
drinkability
is
pretty
good
even
if
the
abv
seems
higher
than
it
actually
is
a
brown
ale
that
i
really
like
pretty
good
brew
that
went
perfect
with
the
jambayla
pours
quite
dark
with
a
real
roasty
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
but
very
drinkable
i
liked
the
way
it
worked
with
the
food
and
i
wanted
another
one
fairly
soon
hope
this
beer
makes
it
up
to
bc
one
day
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
but
im
not
a
stout
fan
still
like
it
enough
worth
a
shot
to
people
new
to
stoutporter
styles
drinkable
enough
i
suppose
i
bought
this
as
a
single
at
world
market
and
wont
be
running
back
to
get
a
6
pack
of
it
drinkability
i
finished
about
23rds
of
this
before
the
aftertaste
got
to
me
and
i
dumped
the
rest
shame
this
could
have
been
good
i
wouldnt
be
adverse
to
trying
it
again
i
could
have
a
bad
bottle
since
my
head
was
nearly
nonexistent
d
wow
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
low
abv
and
good
flavors
make
this
a
nice
session
brew
but
it
also
can
be
a
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
kind
of
beer
great
mix
of
things
yeah
i
gotta
call
it
watery
its
really
really
thin
but
that
makes
it
chuggable
gone
in
an
instant
d
not
a
bad
brown
ale
and
probably
the
best
abita
brew
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
will
it
satisfy
a
big
flavorful
brew
need
no
but
it
is
a
good
solid
drinkable
brown
ale
that
will
not
offend
it
just
isnt
going
to
make
you
sayholy
sht
at
5
6
alcohol
it
will
definitely
make
for
a
good
session
dsessionable
went
well
with
the
jambalaya
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
keep
these
around
when
friends
are
over
whom
seem
to
like
this
i
do
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
i
recommend
this
beer
for
anyone
who
wants
to
have
a
very
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
however
not
in
the
same
league
as
rogue
hazelnut
brown
or
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
the
smell
sums
this
beer
up
for
me
its
got
things
going
on
chocolate
barley
a
little
bitter
but
it
dies
off
a
little
short
same
with
the
taste
ends
up
slightly
on
the
watery
side
despite
keeping
it
real
most
of
the
way
this
also
brings
down
the
points
for
mouthfeel
its
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
me
however
you
cant
forget
that
its
an
ale
so
despite
the
fact
that
it
leans
towards
stout
oh
yeah
its
up
front
about
the
ale
factor
which
explains
the
wateryness
all
in
all
a
super
solid
brew
especially
for
the
price
and
one
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
of
in
one
night
will
buy
again
dabove
average
drinkability
quite
sessionable
cheers
d
i
must
say
had
this
in
a
bottle
and
was
good
had
it
on
tap
and
was
better
a
great
offering
from
abita
nice
to
see
all
the
way
up
here
a
more
drinkable
and
nuanced
brown
ale
than
i
am
used
to
but
still
really
good
abita
turbodog
is
a
very
dark
berrybrown
colored
ale
with
a
sand
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
film
and
leaves
pretty
nice
lacing
it
has
a
faint
grainy
aroma
it
smells
roasty
and
a
touch
sweet
its
pretty
light
bodied
pretty
smooth
and
a
little
watery
at
the
finish
its
lightly
flavored
with
a
smooth
roastiness
there
are
notes
of
chocolate
and
malt
balls
its
a
little
sweet
without
much
bitterness
its
very
simple
and
pretty
easy
drinking
this
is
the
second
brown
ale
ive
tried
after
newcastle
and
i
definitely
like
turbodog
more
it
doesnt
seem
as
bland
or
thin
abita
did
right
with
this
one
its
good
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
nice
job
on
the
style
interpretation
a
easy
smooth
drink
mostly
drinkable
big
strong
flavors
and
a
strong
mouth
feel
may
turn
off
some
d
a
nice
quaffable
brew
with
good
malty
flavors
a
nice
hop
flavor
profile
id
sit
down
with
23
pints
sometime
but
nothing
id
buy
again
i
was
kinda
looking
for
just
a
bit
more
toffee
in
the
flavor
but
not
bad
at
all
its
worth
a
try
d
nice
beer
but
id
like
the
flavor
kicked
up
just
a
bit
and
the
hops
taken
down
a
notch
other
then
that
decent
brown
ale
d
the
brew
drank
alright
and
i
thought
the
smokiness
was
really
good
and
added
dimension
to
the
beer
abita
turbodog
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
the
same
color
as
the
auburn
bottle
it
comes
in
the
caramel
colored
head
seems
to
be
thick
and
frothy
the
head
was
still
hanging
out
in
the
middle
of
my
pint
glass
when
i
was
half
way
through
this
beer
nice
it
smells
of
rich
sweet
brown
sugar
that
is
very
welcoming
and
a
little
leathery
its
a
lot
softer
than
i
imagined
i
guess
the
black
label
and
the
big
name
always
lead
me
to
believe
this
was
a
huge
stout
however
it
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
with
hints
of
molasses
and
a
soft
tobacco
on
the
finish
it
does
linger
on
the
palate
a
bit
longer
then
i
would
like
what
more
can
i
say
its
good
d
decent
brown
ale
that
hides
the
abv
well
good
for
12
at
the
most
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
although
i
wouldnt
necessarily
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
on
its
own
id
definitely
like
to
try
this
again
with
a
meal
some
sweet
rubbed
baby
back
ribs
perhaps
i
recommend
this
beer
for
anyone
who
wants
to
have
a
very
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
there
are
other
browns
i
enjoy
better
brooklyn
rogues
moose
drool
but
a
very
solid
brown
for
a
style
that
i
particularly
like
and
appreciate
again
since
i
am
from
louisiana
i
have
to
show
a
little
bias
but
i
actually
really
like
this
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
about
a
finger
worth
of
beige
head
when
you
bring
the
glass
up
to
smell
you
will
almost
immediately
notice
the
faint
aroma
of
chocolate
has
a
very
good
taste
going
down
with
a
clean
finish
mildly
carbonated
and
decent
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
at
the
flying
saucer
in
memphis
tn
poured
a
carbonated
cloudy
dark
brown
with
one
finger
of
beige
head
and
decent
lacing
smelled
very
malty
with
small
traces
of
milk
chocolate
tasted
very
bland
dominated
by
maltiness
and
again
only
a
touch
of
chocolate
very
thin
for
a
brown
ale
and
very
carbonated
not
a
fan
d
refreshing
to
drink
and
definitely
easy
going
down
unfortunately
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
smell
and
appearance
not
the
greatest
example
of
a
brown
ale
but
definitely
not
the
worst
either
good
beer
just
not
great
if
i
want
a
malt
fix
going
to
a
scotch
ale
d
im
just
not
into
this
one
at
all
nothing
to
point
out
in
terms
of
flavor
here
i
just
had
this
beer
for
the
1st
time
the
other
night
on
tap
my
local
watering
hole
it
has
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
a
little
head
it
had
a
light
chocolate
aroma
the
taste
was
smiler
to
the
smell
it
was
a
light
chocolate
flavor
but
not
too
sweet
with
some
toffee
hops
just
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
overall
a
average
to
good
beer
but
i
was
ready
to
move
on
to
a
different
beer
rather
than
have
another
drinkability
is
very
high
due
to
the
lightness
and
interesting
flavors
for
some
reason
this
beer
seems
like
more
of
a
black
lager
than
a
brown
ale
both
in
color
and
flavor
profile
nonetheless
a
solid
and
refreshing
ale
check
it
off
as
drinkable
but
otherwise
it
seems
unremarkable
the
name
is
fun
to
say
though
solid
at
the
most
notes
an
excellent
strong
ale
with
the
balance
and
pedigree
of
a
great
brown
ale
d
overall
a
decent
beer
just
not
too
impressive
smell
is
not
strong
sweet
caramel
notes
flavor
is
along
the
same
lines
but
surprisingly
weak
tastes
almost
watered
down
not
sure
id
want
a
second
one
drinkability
ok
i
have
had
way
better
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
abita
hit
vermont
today
and
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
any
of
their
beer
i
had
purple
haze
hated
it
had
their
ipa
thought
it
was
decent
this
one
is
pretty
good
though
i
usually
cant
stand
brown
ales
but
this
has
got
a
very
nice
malt
profile
this
is
a
lot
like
a
german
double
bock
but
much
easier
to
drink
fairly
sweet
and
somewhat
smokey
the
mouthfeel
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
its
very
smooth
and
silky
overall
a
very
nice
brew
d
it
smells
like
an
adjunct
drinkable
beer
but
ended
up
being
an
overly
bitter
beer
with
not
a
lot
of
flavor
d
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
i
would
buy
again
i
really
enjoyed
it
d
drinking
this
beer
is
a
breeze
and
its
very
sessionable
im
not
big
on
brown
ales
so
if
you
are
dont
take
my
word
for
it
its
good
for
a
taste
but
ill
move
on
to
more
flavorful
pastures
dense
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
not
overly
heavy
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
but
im
assuming
the
beer
is
a
little
better
than
im
rating
it
drinkablity
is
good
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
and
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
it
would
make
a
good
session
brew
although
its
not
the
most
flavorful
example
of
the
style
i
would
have
it
again
if
it
happened
to
be
around
reminded
me
of
a
weak
stout
or
washed
up
porter
not
overly
impressed
and
being
part
irish
there
is
no
substitute
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
expiration
date
checked
off
on
the
label
sampled
on
may
13
2010
it
pours
brown
with
some
ruby
red
hues
and
about
a
half
an
inch
of
silky
light
brown
head
there
are
a
variety
of
light
hops
in
the
aroma
but
nothing
in
particular
stands
out
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
thin
chocolate
malts
along
with
a
pleasing
backdrop
of
hops
a
fairly
likeable
beer
i
could
drink
these
for
hours
great
with
steak
or
just
to
relax
with
the
carbonations
is
on
the
money
and
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
can
drink
this
all
day
everyday
d
i
think
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
since
they
dont
overload
and
stay
on
the
palate
much
this
really
seems
like
a
beer
that
you
drink
with
heavily
flavored
food
and
would
work
well
at
a
bbq
however
it
seems
that
it
is
just
a
little
bit
too
heavy
on
its
own
to
go
with
pizza
with
which
beer
is
mandatory
for
me
this
is
a
difficult
category
since
i
find
that
many
of
my
favorite
beers
are
very
strongly
flavored
and
only
one
or
two
max
should
be
consumed
at
a
time
this
is
not
a
fast
drinking
beer
it
is
not
refreshing
and
i
dont
think
it
is
supposed
to
be
d
very
drinkable
one
of
the
lightest
beers
though
i
wouldnt
recommend
to
convert
a
bmc
drinker
not
sure
why
that
came
to
mind
but
i
just
dont
think
it
would
work
poured
into
guinness
glass
very
dark
brown
with
reddish
hues
smells
like
chocalatecovered
rye
crackers
to
me
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
tastes
good
somewhat
like
newcastle
only
richer
i
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
next
winter
i
could
see
myself
having
this
again
i
would
have
again
given
the
similar
circumstances
d
not
a
bad
brew
for
one
or
two
thanks
to
the
fair
malt
and
hop
balance
but
not
a
chart
topping
brown
due
to
the
lack
of
a
really
punchy
flavor
and
mouthfeel
enjoyed
at
papa
mojos
in
durham
nc
this
brew
shows
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
strong
tan
colored
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
suggests
a
mild
rye
malt
and
maybe
even
an
illusion
of
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
brings
light
charcoal
and
sweet
licorice
malt
with
some
rain
water
crispness
and
mild
carbonation
plenty
drinakable
near
medium
bodied
a
tad
lifeless
but
smooth
and
a
little
tingly
on
the
tongue
i
pick
up
some
skunkiness
with
leafygrass
hop
edges
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
perhaps
but
its
more
toward
the
brown
sugar
in
the
final
analysis
worth
a
try
but
not
anything
to
cause
uncontollable
salivation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
the
cult
status
seems
to
be
quite
well
deserved
cheers
dthe
mouthfeel
really
throws
me
off
some
good
flavors
are
there
but
i
really
am
looking
for
something
that
stays
on
the
tongue
longer
i
would
likely
pass
on
this
in
the
future
whats
a
turbodog
youd
maybe
imagine
bulldogs
on
choppers
or
beagles
piloting
prop
planes
this
beer
however
is
such
a
letdown
i
instead
see
images
of
droopy
dog
muffled
and
depressed
boohoo
mouthfeel
is
chewy
hoppy
and
evenly
balanced
to
sum
3
words
goto
beer
d
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
i
was
not
too
sure
what
i
would
be
getting
with
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
would
definitely
purchase
this
one
again
cheers
had
on
tap
at
old
chicago
in
uptown
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
ring
and
some
good
lacing
it
looked
like
a
scotch
ale
the
smell
was
faint
in
malts
some
chocolate
some
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
was
better
then
the
smell
it
had
some
hops
mixed
with
roasted
malts
some
toast
some
bitter
hops
and
some
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumthin
for
an
english
brown
overall
it
was
ok
tasty
not
one
i
will
buy
a
sixer
of
but
it
was
ok
to
try
on
tap
slightly
recommended
mouthfeel
was
overly
carbonated
and
fairly
thinl
i
was
underwhelmed
drinkability
was
not
great
didnt
seek
another
one
out
while
in
nola
dont
know
that
i
will
for
another
couple
years
d
a
descent
beer
but
nothing
amazing
it
would
be
sessionable
but
it
was
just
a
bit
heavy
for
me
and
lacks
the
complexity
id
like
taste
is
a
very
malty
without
any
of
the
subtle
sweetness
i
expected
from
the
nose
and
style
there
is
a
little
bit
of
toffee
but
this
mostly
is
a
toasted
flavor
finish
is
a
little
bit
bitter
but
not
so
much
as
to
distract
from
the
drink
strong
medium
body
that
is
rich
and
enjoyable
i
did
expect
more
spicy
earthy
hop
flavors
id
be
happy
if
i
knew
how
old
this
bottle
was
cough
cough
abita
use
the
label
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
again
given
the
more
flavorful
options
in
the
price
range
and
in
styles
i
prefer
mediumlight
bodied
and
carbonated
appropriately
for
style
a
delicious
beer
for
sure
its
easily
drinkable
this
beer
has
a
very
interesting
texture
and
flavor
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
but
i
must
admit
this
is
a
brew
i
recommend
people
give
a
try
drinkability
is
high
goes
down
easy
seems
like
it
would
pair
well
with
rich
or
spicy
food
not
sure
if
i
want
to
just
drink
one
but
with
some
jambalaya
heck
yeah
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
with
not
a
lot
of
overpowering
flavors
or
alcohol
by
nature
this
wasnt
the
smoothest
drinkability
but
it
was
more
than
smooth
enough
for
a
dark
brown
md
way
too
thin
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
its
drinkable
and
id
have
one
if
i
were
in
new
orleans
and
there
was
nothing
else
around
but
overall
its
pretty
bland
and
uninteresting
very
dry
and
lively
for
a
brown
its
also
got
a
remarkably
full
body
and
smooth
finish
almost
like
it
was
poured
from
a
nitro
tap
like
everything
else
from
abita
this
is
quite
well
brewed
d
i
would
track
down
a
reasonably
priced
sixer
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
biscuits
very
nice
nutty
coffee
flavor
a
good
flavor
somewhere
between
a
guinness
and
a
newcastle
has
a
clean
mouthfeel
for
a
brown
ale
nice
and
sweet
very
drinkable
would
be
a
nice
session
brown
ale
would
definately
order
again
when
looking
for
a
nice
light
brown
ale
rjt
the
feel
is
okay
this
seems
to
be
a
cross
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
porter
it
isnt
bad
bad
i
wouldnt
look
for
it
again
tasty
nice
brew
drinkable
beer
is
medium
in
body
smooth
slight
really
subtle
roast
in
the
back
overall
well
balanced
drinkability
high
good
carbonation
on
the
palate
some
sweetness
in
there
as
well
second
taste
sweetness
first
no
real
bitterness
mouthfeel
good
i
like
this
beer
thank
you
abita
you
have
redeemed
yourself
again
d
nice
and
easy
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
pretty
much
anytime
this
beer
surprised
me
as
it
was
a
rowdy
frat
boy
that
suggested
it
to
me
very
nice
head
stood
up
to
the
test
of
time
and
even
though
it
was
served
slightly
warm
the
flavor
was
still
decent
chocolaty
taste
with
hints
of
a
nuttiness
to
it
drank
from
a
standard
pint
glass
and
lacing
was
not
present
at
all
that
i
could
see
much
lighter
than
expected
for
this
style
dark
raisin
bread
and
cocoa
powder
flavors
are
rich
there
is
a
persistant
hop
freshness
finish
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
i
appreciate
this
beers
delicate
nature
highly
drinkable
overall
definitely
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
abita
subtle
and
tasty
would
be
a
fine
session
brew
or
a
nice
pairing
with
a
burger
or
grilled
steak
not
anything
im
going
out
of
the
way
to
try
again
this
is
a
polar
opposite
in
quality
of
their
andygator
that
i
had
at
the
beginning
of
the
night
pours
with
a
dark
brown
color
fizzy
head
that
diminishes
quickly
has
a
pungent
smell
roasted
malts
and
coffee
are
the
most
prominent
has
a
mostly
coffee
taste
i
didnt
really
think
the
blend
mixes
well
for
an
ale
overall
is
a
sharp
beer
that
finishes
lighter
than
i
expected
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
i
would
want
to
drink
all
night
had
this
beer
at
o
cs
the
dark
deep
brown
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
smelled
more
of
a
malty
style
of
beer
with
tints
of
caramel
when
tasting
the
beer
it
is
well
established
malt
taste
with
a
slight
cooking
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
plums
as
i
neared
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
bitter
taste
was
present
overall
a
decent
beer
to
have
with
pizza
but
nothing
that
i
would
drink
alone
without
a
pairing
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
not
particularly
strong
but
seems
more
malty
than
hoppy
a
bit
of
caramel
and
bread
crust
the
taste
again
is
malt
dominant
a
light
generalized
roasted
flavor
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
dates
the
carbonation
is
appropriate
and
the
body
is
a
bit
light
compared
to
the
appearance
i
would
not
classify
this
beer
as
an
english
brown
at
all
it
resembles
more
of
an
american
black
lager
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
easily
drink
several
more
if
in
the
mood
d
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
drinkability
i
never
want
another
one
of
these
if
someone
offers
it
to
me
ill
say
no
thanks
but
i
will
take
a
glass
of
water
at
least
its
not
a
heavy
beer
its
motto
should
be
bad
taste
less
filling
abita
turbodog
is
very
sessionable
which
is
typical
with
most
abita
beers
although
this
particular
beer
is
very
complexed
in
flavors
overall
it
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
well
worth
trying
i
though
it
was
a
porter
but
brown
is
definitely
a
better
description
very
drinkable
dark
brown
lowish
carbonation
but
in
general
a
very
decent
brown
ale
the
beer
is
translucent
and
has
a
dark
ruby
color
it
reminds
me
of
cranberry
juice
there
was
no
head
but
it
was
poured
for
me
by
a
bartender
who
doesnt
look
like
a
beer
guy
i
e
someone
who
probably
thinks
head
bad
there
is
a
slightly
malty
aroma
but
i
cant
detect
must
else
as
i
said
above
this
beer
is
very
cold
so
that
may
be
a
limiting
factor
the
beer
tastes
like
sweet
dark
fruit
there
is
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
cant
taste
much
else
but
as
i
said
it
has
been
served
way
too
cold
it
has
an
above
medium
body
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
despite
it
not
performing
well
when
served
at
a
cold
temperature
the
turbodog
is
a
good
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
and
could
order
a
few
of
them
but
probably
not
at
this
bar
if
i
get
the
chance
to
have
another
ill
submit
a
new
review
of
the
beer
at
the
correct
serving
temperature
drinkability
while
this
beer
is
somewhat
tasty
i
feel
like
its
acidity
is
really
going
to
impact
how
much
of
it
i
can
drink
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
consumed
with
soda
bread
or
somesuch
value
pricey
for
what
it
is
this
poured
a
dark
caramellike
color
it
held
an
inchthick
creamy
caramel
colored
head
for
about
2
minutes
nice
lacing
it
smelled
hoppy
but
also
with
a
hint
of
roasted
nuts
and
chocolate
it
was
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
i
was
expecting
something
thicker
the
taste
is
worth
the
expense
and
it
is
definately
an
easy
drink
i
really
enjoyed
the
aftertaste
smokey
chocolatey
my
take
give
it
a
whirl
another
offering
from
abita
that
offers
a
somewhat
tentative
approach
to
the
style
nice
yet
a
bit
inconspicuous
though
likely
befitting
of
the
climate
of
louisiana
turbodog
is
not
overly
complex
but
it
totally
fits
the
bill
of
an
english
brown
flavorwise
and
sessionability
not
outstanding
within
the
world
of
extreme
beers
but
overall
just
a
tasty
easy
drinking
brown
ale
which
i
would
consider
a
success
d
i
found
this
beer
a
bit
odd
on
the
pallet
but
i
would
drink
again
d
its
not
hard
to
drink
but
the
taste
is
just
offensive
enough
with
that
much
sugar
to
keep
me
from
doing
a
lot
of
it
overall
i
feel
really
neutral
about
this
one
i
found
the
slight
sourness
strange
but
tolerable
i
didnt
some
out
with
high
expectations
and
thats
how
it
turned
out
d
im
actually
pretty
impressed
by
this
beer
this
to
me
anyways
should
be
the
flagship
of
the
abita
line
i
enjoyed
this
beer
immensely
and
will
be
picking
more
up
in
the
future
drinkability
very
drinkable
smooth
personally
there
are
times
i
crave
a
nice
mild
brown
ale
that
isnt
overwhelming
to
the
palate
this
beer
fills
the
bill
smells
mildly
of
chocolate
the
beer
itself
tastes
grassy
with
hints
of
nuttiness
and
chocolate
drinkability
is
ok
but
its
finish
was
sort
of
bland
found
out
afterr
freezing
the
bottle
this
is
one
to
rink
warm
might
have
to
rereview
it
after
drinking
a
sort
of
warm
bottle
brownish
pour
cant
really
identify
any
identifiable
aroma
or
smell
not
the
typical
chocolate
or
coffee
flavors
you
might
see
in
darker
colored
beers
not
really
a
sweet
beer
just
kind
of
bland
sorry
guys
overall
drinks
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
but
i
would
return
again
and
i
have
since
writing
this
review
a
solid
b
nice
dark
brow
color
smaller
head
with
brown
tint
good
roasted
malt
smell
and
taste
with
a
decent
sweetness
but
lacks
finish
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
good
and
strong
while
in
the
mouth
but
very
faint
and
lacking
taste
after
you
swallow
overall
a
decent
beer
but
fell
short
of
my
high
hopes
one
of
abitas
best
but
i
usually
lose
interest
at
about
1
12
due
to
sugar
overload
certainly
an
interesting
beer
flavors
all
over
the
place
that
works
well
for
me
in
a
eba
from
a
12
oz
bottle
courtesy
of
a
trading
partner
in
illinois
this
poured
a
muddy
brown
color
with
as
moderate
sized
brown
head
and
light
lacing
nose
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
some
floral
hops
light
aroma
overall
mouthfeel
is
light
and
just
short
of
watery
flavor
shows
coffee
and
chocolate
and
a
little
ripe
fruit
not
much
in
the
finish
while
this
is
quite
drinkable
i
like
my
browns
to
not
be
quite
so
bland
purchased
at
beer
store
very
dark
brown
color
with
some
red
tint
showing
through
thick
dark
tan
head
aroma
was
of
yeast
bread
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
caramel
very
pleasant
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
flavor
was
bread
caramel
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
very
tasty
finish
was
smooth
and
well
balanced
with
no
aftertaste
overall
a
teriffic
beer
drinkability
a
pretty
tasty
brown
ale
looks
and
smells
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
but
still
not
bad
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
purple
haze
but
this
is
pretty
nice
i
would
definately
grab
it
again
this
a
beer
i
would
drink
anytime
i
felt
like
a
brown
i
dunno
i
used
to
really
like
this
one
and
its
still
a
decent
beer
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
it
on
tap
at
the
bars
and
not
spend
money
to
bring
them
home
drink
oh
ya
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
i
want
a
lot
more
of
these
the
taste
is
light
pruneraisin
alcohol
slightly
caramelised
whole
wheat
bread
light
earthyleafy
bitterness
with
light
sweetness
overall
its
tasty
but
rather
bland
and
a
bit
nondescript
it
has
the
faintest
hint
of
coffee
lightly
sweet
up
front
it
has
a
finish
leaning
slightly
to
the
bitter
side
with
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
the
feel
is
good
firm
but
not
thick
or
oily
and
yet
not
quite
lively
this
beer
is
new
orleans
turbodog
has
a
great
rich
flavor
a
deep
musky
aroma
and
a
hugeass
head
yet
with
all
that
it
goes
down
as
smoothly
as
any
lite
beer
strange
no
found
at
basically
any
cajun
restaurant
this
is
a
great
sidearm
to
bring
into
battle
with
that
spicy
jambalaya
or
spicy
anything
for
that
matter
turbodog
quenches
thirst
like
fucking
gatorade
even
though
its
one
of
the
darker
brewskis
i
enjoy
i
can
still
put
back
more
than
a
few
because
of
its
superior
drinkability
bud
lites
got
nothing
on
this
baby
poured
from
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
shaker
glass
appears
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
good
inch
of
fluffy
light

and
flavors
consist
of
milk
chocolate
toffee
caramelized
malt
medium
roasted
grains
cocoa
powder
faint
hints
of
coffee
decent
somewhat
rich
body
for
the
style

pretty
nice
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch

smell
is
mild
a
bit
malty
taste
is
of
malts
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
feels
good
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
pretty
good
choice
d
a
solid
to
great
brown
ale
that
is
surprisingly
smooth
simply
tasty
and
an
easy
drinking
beer
when
you
want
something
a
bit
darker
than
the
norm
nice
overall
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
there
is
not
much
going
on
here
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
respectable
head
with
good
retention
looked
good
for
a
fast
start
no
aroma
ok
a
lot
of
good
beers
dont
slowed
going
into
the
first
corner
what
no
taste
either
alright
there
is
some
coffee
but
not
much
almost
came
to
a
stop
in
the
second
turn
feel
is
barely
medium
with
decent
carbonation
limping
through
the
third
turn
drinkability
who
cares
no
kick
left
for
the
finish
overall
not
horrible
but
bland
and
disappointing
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
close
to
black
color
with
a
tan
frothy
head
with
some
nice
lacing
to
the
glass
you
can
see
the
dark
brown
on
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
smells
of
chocolate
aroma
and
roasted
malts
similar
to
a
porter
but
not
very
strong
taste
again
much
similar
to
the
smell
slight
smokey
taste
at
the
end
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
quite
pleasant
on
this
beer
very
crisp
and
refreshing
for
such
a
dark
colored
brew
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
in
this
beer
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
the
waitress
told
me
it
was
a
porter
when
she
brought
it
and
a
good
one
at
that
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
its
really
an
english
brown
ale
i
enjoyed
it
overall
it
looks
and
tastes
very
similar
to
a
porter
but
certainly
has
the
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
of
an
ale
could
be
quite
the
neutral
crowdpleaser
at
a
gathering
of
picky
beer
drinkers
d
brewed
for
drinkability
this
brown
ale
has
it
going
on
the
appearance
and
flavor
are
there
putting
it
into
the
drinkallday
category
another
good
brew
from
abita
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
lacks
alot
of
complexity
but
overall
is
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
an
interesting
all
around
beer
for
sure
a
session
lover
indeed
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
not
in
the
least
bit
overcarbonated
drinks
easy
and
i
would
definitely
see
myself
buying
this
one
in
the
future
pours
a
dark
brown
colored
body
clearish
in
the
light
huge
foamy
tan
colored
head
very
lasting
roasty
aroma
some
nuttiness
some
funky
dusty
aroma
reminiscent
of
all
abitas
beers
maybe
the
spring
water
some
fruitiness
too
not
a
strong
aroma
fruity
taste
maybe
strawberry
along
with
some
maltiness
nuttiness
too
some
roasted
flavors
watery
palate
some
fruitiness
like
strawberry
tasty
t
probably
not
the
greatest
example
of
a
brown
ale
but
a
solid
one
and
personally
there
is
not
a
better
beer
out
there
to
match
up
with
a
bowl
of
gumbo
or
a
crawfish
boil
very
easy
to
drink
pairs
well
with
food
d
while
there
are
better
browns
out
there
this
was
solid
and
i
enjoyed
it
probably
the
best
abita
beer
i
have
had
so
far
d
good
beer
caught
between
a
brown
ale
and
stout
i
wouldnt
return
specifically
for
the
beer
but
the
food
was
really
good
now
they
just
need
to
serve
a
beer
that
can
stand
up
to
the
spice
and
flavor
brown
in
color
with
substantial
foam
on
the
head
slight
bit
of
prickle
very
faint
malt
nose
but
almost
undetectable
the
attack
is
refreshing
and
pretty
clean
with
a
quick
presentation
of
the
malt
flavor
there
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
anise
there
is
some
odd
quality
to
the
malt
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
other
beers
that
i
have
tried
i
cannot
quite
place
it
but
it
distracts
me
a
bit
overall
however
i
find
the
beer
to
be
pretty
standard
and
average
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
drinks
very
well
definite
session
goodness
pours
clear
dark
redbrown
with
a
huge
lingering
head
with
thick
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malts
flavor
is
nothing
surprising
with
medium
body
and
carbonation
notes
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
overall
not
bad
at
all
just
not
really
my
thing
probably
better
consumed
a
little
colder
than
i
typically
drink
dark
beers
visuals
are
a
dark
brown
virtually
opaque
smell
molases
woodiness
toasty
hints
of
coffee
taste
is
close
to
smell
the
woodiness
flavor
is
more
pronounced
with
a
bitter
chocolate
backbone
hints
of
malt
and
very
little
after
taste
very
little
lacing
with
just
a
rim
head
drinkabilty
is
somewhat
decent
but
doesnt
have
the
burst
of
taste
like
the
stronger
abv
drinks
do
however
the
overall
consumption
is
smoother
with
a
nice
chocolaty
finish
this
is
no
means
on
my
top
list
but
is
a
nice
interpetation
of
a
nice
brown
ale
d
i
like
this
beer
but
i
can
only
have
one
of
these
in
a
seating
d
my
first
abita
a
pretty
average
experience
very
different
brown
unique
in
its
own
way
and
i
enjoyed
it
as
such
still
this
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
chocolatey
for
my
taste
thus
its
probably
not
a
brew
id
recco
going
out
of
your
way
for
still
if
youre
looking
for
something
unique
and
its
in
your
area
give
it
a
shot
d
a
little
too
bitter
to
drink
a
lot
without
feeling
sick
great
for
desert
and
maybe
a
cold
winter
day
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
for
much
else
d
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
in
the
end
it
just
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
stout
instead
the
lack
of
body
is
obvious
and
really
detrimental
to
the
brew
i
am
having
a
hard
time
seperating
my
own
preferences
on
this
one
i
think
that
abita
may
have
just
taken
the
style
a
little
too
far
would
not
drink
another
one
all
in
all
this
is
a
highly
palateable
dark
brew
if
more
were
like
this
id
drink
them
more
often
d
we
did
a
blind
tasting
of
7
browns
and
this
tied
for
3rd
drinkability
this
is
a
very
different
tasting
brown
and
i
wanted
to
like
it
better
than
i
ultimately
did
a
deep
amberbrown

grainy
with
lots
of
unsweetened
choclate
flavor
is
mostly
of
slightly
burnt
unsweetened
choclate
with
a
little
kiss
of
hop
spice
and
a
bit
of
toffee
at
the
end
a
somewhat
watery
body
but
very
nice
feeling
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beers
body
is
light
carbonation
is
active
but
works
really
well
with
the
beer
the
beer
left
my
glass
quickly
i
could
easily
spend
an
evening
drinking
nothing
but
turbo
dog
a
good
dark
ale
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
this
is
a
musttry
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
in
a
row
bitterness
shows
up
quite
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
as
the
sweetness
subsides
and
the
cocoa
and
toasty
notes
become
more
pronounced
its
pretty
good
but
feels
like
something
is
missing
or
out
of
balance
here
perhaps
too
much
toasty
malt
and
not
enough
nuttiness
and
sweetness
not
bad
but
the
flavors
dont
really
do
it
for
me
d
not
bad
for
a
brown
ale
i
would
probably
stick
to
my
other
favorites
rather
than
have
this
one
again
however
it
is
what
it
is
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
decent
drinker
but
nothing
that
really
impressed
me
mfd
medium
bodied
went
down
well
a
quality
brown
ale
very
nice
looking
beer
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
got
a
nice
little
creamy
head
with
a
dark
brown
body
smells
nice
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
molasses
taste
is
nice
roasty
caramel
flavor
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
it
wasnt
as
robust
of
a
flavor
as
i
was
expecting
mouthfeel
was
carbonated
and
light
in
body
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
creamy
feel
to
it
this
beer
is
nicely
sessionable
and
the
5
6
is
not
apparent
decent
beer
but
it
wont
be
part
of
my
regular
line
up
overall
this
was
an
ok
beer
that
i
dont
think
lived
up
to
all
the
hype
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
again
m
very
smooth
with
a
medium
weight
leaves
the
mouth
slightly
dry
drinkability
is
high
enough
that
i
drink
it
after
runs
i
had
the
beer
with
a
fish
stick
sandwich
and
peas
a
poor
mans
fish
and
chips
minus
the
chips
and
this
beer
i
think
goes
better
with
beef
or
poultry
rich
in
flavor
rather
than
fish
still
very
good
and
since
i
have
a
six
pack
ill
have
to
try
it
with
some
other
meals
and
see
how
it
does
d
like
i
said
this
was
an
interesting
beer
that
means
it
would
be
good
for
a
couple
beers
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
session
this
i
enjoyed
it
for
one
bottle
but
i
doubt
this
will
be
a
regular
for
me
theres
dates
along
the
edges
of
the
back
label
but
nothing
is
actually
marked
how
useless
poured
a
dark
reddishbrown
body
almost
black
one
finger
head
the
color
of
cocacola
fizz
slowly
drops
it
smells
a
bit
like
caramel
and
tootsie
rolls
sweet
thin
bodied
with
a
nice
floral
hop
presence
and
a
light
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
didnt
exactly
knock
my
socks
off
but
id
still
recomend
trying
it
pretty
good
but
i
feel
the
beer
is
looking
for
a
home
like
a
lost
porter
mixed
with
a
weak
stout
married
to
a
strong
brown
ale
d
this
is
where
this
one
really
suffers
just
not
something
id
like
to
have
more
than
one
of
although
it
does
have
some
fine
points
d
drinkable
did
drink
six
of
them
just
hanging
out
i
may
have
to
give
it
a
second
chance
d
sweet
and
full
of
flavor
yet
has
a
very
drinkable
quality
found
in
many
brown
ales
d
a
very
light
brown
ale
i
could
drink
a
million
of
these
because
of
the
little
carbonation
it
is
drinkable
goes
down
easy
there
are
some
bumps
which
are
appreciated
but
still
disappointed
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
batch
drinkability
i
have
to
say
i
truely
believe
i
had
bad
batch
here
i
had
this
on
tap
recently
and
i
really
liked
it
this
one
was
not
very
drinkable
at
all
but
i
will
with
out
a
doubt
give
it
one
more
shot
bummer
not
fun
to
waste
8
bucks
to
be
re
reviewed
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
abita
beers
that
ive
had
second
only
to
their
jockamo
ipa
worth
a
shot
not
bad
good
rendition
of
english
brown
pours
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
head
looks
very
inviting
good
head
retention
the
head
is
actually
quite
amazing
this
is
a
really
sweet
brown
ale
lots
of
toffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
moutfeel
suffers
from
being
too
sodalike
and
definitely
not
very
british
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
at
the
brewpub
fresh
and
probably
a
nice
intro
beer
to
new
craft
beer
drinkers
i
have
to
give
this
beer
credit
for
being
complex
i
just
think
this
ones
a
little
bit
too
complex
for
me
the
chocolate
malt
is
very
prevalent
and
the
taste
is
a
mixture
of
coffee
and
chocolate
aftertaste
is
very
smooth
but
the
initial
taste
has
some
bitter
flavors
that
i
didnt
like
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
pretty
impressive
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
however
smells
like
roasted
coffee
overall
its
a
decent
brew
but
not
something
i
would
buy
d
3
5
almost
bock
like
a
good
rich
example
of
the
style
i
also
like
the
new
orleans
memories
that
come
with
an
abita
brew
turbo
dog
leads
the
pack
not
my
favorite
style
so
my
drinkability
score
is
lower
than
it
could
be
a
full
beer
with
some
bite
but
its
the
bite
of
something
bitter
maybe
the
coating
of
an
aspirin
the
beer
looks
thick
and
frothy
like
a
mouthfull
of
sea
foam
and
the
first
time
i
had
it
was
at
a
local
bar
here
in
town
my
friend
recommended
it
so
i
tried
it
and
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
so
i
went
back
for
more
recently
but
this
time
it
was
coming
in
fresh
not
following
another
beer
and
this
time
well
it
stood
up
as
a
strong
brown
bitter
beer
but
maybe
a
bit
overboard
on
the
strong
beer
part
beer
is
good
but
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
would
have
liked
a
thicker
body
with
bolder
flavors
but
overall
goes
down
easily
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
one
i
could
drink
all
night
possibly
a
good
session
beer
poured
into
12oz
glass
poured
a
very
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
over
an
inch
of
deep
tan
head
that
left
a
moderate
amount
of
semisticky
lacing
solid
malt
aroma
that
has
roast
notes
upfront
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
flavor
meets
the
expectations
that
the
aroma
sets
with
the
roasted
grain
flavors
dominating
a
slightly
sweet
finish
full
wellrounded
body
that
goes
down
smoothly
easily
drinkable
having
several
will
leave
you
happily
satisfied
try
this
beer
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
light
body
and
lot
of
carbonation
the
finish
is
bitter
and
is
medium
i
have
been
worried
about
trying
this
beer
from
what
i
have
heard
from
other
people
i
know
that
is
not
an
excuse
to
drink
a
beer
i
am
sorely
disappointed
in
this
beer
the
nose
on
this
beer
was
awesome
and
made
my
mouth
wate
i
was
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
but
the
taste
is
nothing
like
the
nose
it
is
not
malty
or
sweet
like
an
english
brown
ale
oh
well
life
goes
on
fairly
dark
brown
with
light
brown
head
smell
the
malts
not
real
strong
though
med
mouthfeel
taste
malts
but
not
real
heavy
on
them
so
not
real
sweet
some
bitter
hops
in
there
make
it
pretty
balanced
nice
brew
nothing
that
sets
this
apart
as
exceptional
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
pretty
good
for
the
price
point
also
a
dark
rich
midnight
black
in
color
pour
showed
a
small
head
decent
lacing
and
retention
this
one
smelled
of
caramel
nutmeg
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
espresso
bean
taste
was
a
bit
metallic
dont
know
if
it
was
the
bottle
or
what
but
it
tasted
a
bit
like
licking
the
side
of
a
bridge
although
the
good
properties
of
the
beer
are
the
nice
maltiness
and
the
small
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
overall
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
this
too
much
because
of
that
metallic
afterburn
if
it
was
just
the
bottle
i
had
then
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
you
should
seek
out
it
has
a
very
malt
and
chocolate
taste
to
it
its
got
a
bitterness
to
it
that
turns
somewhat
sour
i
had
it
off
the
tap
in
the
past
and
felt
it
was
better
in
a
bottle
its
ok
drinkability
this
brown
ale
is
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
it
tasted
like
a
wannabe
oatmeal
stout
a
turbo
brown
still
its
a
decent
brew
this
beer
really
caught
me
by
surprise
i
pulled
it
out
of
a
mishmash
box
and
didnt
really
expect
too
much
the
label
is
not
particularly
intriguing
in
fact
there
is
nothing
really
to
indicate
youd
be
drinking
anything
but
an
average
beer
i
didnt
go
in
with
respect
for
the
beer
having
prejudged
it
and
carelessly
threw
down
a
swig
i
immediately
realized
my
error
a
delicious
sweet
chocolaty
taste
that
is
far
from
overbearing
with
a
medium
carbonation
and
moderate
but
effective
aftertaste
traditional
malty
smell
but
not
particularly
roasted
quite
the
undervalued
and
overlooked
beer
the
pour
looked
good
a
dark
brown
with
amber
hues
and
a
nice
fluffy
darktan
head
the
smell
was
of
dark
malts
nuts
especially
chestnuts
and
a
pinch
of
bitter
hops
the
smell
was
strong
and
pleasant
and
i
could
catch
a
whiff
of
it
with
the
glass
sitting
on
the
table
a
few
feet
away
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
a
great
mix
of
malts
which
were
simultaneously
dark
chocolate
nutty
and
sweet
toffee
and
brown
sugar
plus
a
dash
of
hop
bitterness
to
round
it
off
and
balance
the
flavor
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
smooth
tasty
not
filling
and
refreshing
d
good
tasty
and
smooth
well
not
as
easy
to
drink
as
newcastle
but
probably
more
tasty
if
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
style
it
might
be
better
but
as
is
it
is
a
very
decent
if
unspectacular
brew
d
good
light
in
heft
yet
with
solid
browntype
flavors
make
this
one
easily
sessionable
id
definitely
get
this
again
as
a
session
brown
drinkability
this
is
one
of
abitas
better
offerings
that
i
have
tasted
so
far
if
the
abv
was
not
as
high
i
would
session
it
i
will
be
getting
this
again
a
excellent
example
of
a
english
brown
ale
drinkability
a
nice
brown
ale
not
as
sweet
as
ive
come
to
find
in
brown
ales
but
very
enjoyable
first
impressions
on
this
one
are
mixed
it
looked
great
in
my
glass
but
the
taste
for
me
anyway
was
fairly
unremarkable
still
this
strikes
me
as
a
decent
cold
weather
brew
one
of
the
easier
brown
ales
to
put
back
not
too
sweet
as
many
are
the
over
6
abv
isnt
apparent
so
be
careful
however
i
drank
this
before
dinner
so
it
went
down
exceptionally
quickly
d
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
which
i
did
while
watching
football
nikki
a
good
dark
ale
malt
flavor
is
tasty
pretty
brown
color
smell
is
very
pleasing
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
in
carbonation
not
a
favorite
style
but
it
seems
like
a
solid
choice
d
this
is
a
good
drinkable
brown
to
me
so
far
this
seems
to
be
the
best
of
the
bunch
bottle
pour
into
shaker
brown
with
moderate
tan
head
good
lacing
throughout
roasted
sweet
malts
caramel
chocolate
flavors
a
bit
above
average
maybe
i
this
beer
was
touted
too
much
by
a
few
family
members
but
to
me
it
was
nothing
special
they
have
2
bottles
of
this
in
the
party
pack
and
thats
about
where
i
would
cap
it
off
on
this
one
between
this
and
the
other
flagships
offered
in
the
pack
amber
light
purple
haze
id
say
this
is
my
favorite
nothing
overly
special
but
still
nice
to
have
1
or
2
of
every
now
and
then
probably
one
of
abitas
better
offerings
though
not
the
best
it
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
it
is
one
of
the
best
from
abita
that
i
have
tried
d
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
a
nice
rich
fairly
complex
flavor
that
is
well
rounded
and
very
very
drinkable
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlightswhen
held
up
to
a
light
the
head
is
about
2
fingers
of
white
fluff
when
it
recedes
it
leaves
thick
lacing
all
over
the
pint
the
aroma
is
very
light
a
bit
of
a
roasted
character
is
all
i
detect
the
flavor
is
mostly
bitter
sweet
chocolate
not
overly
sweet
the
finish
is
crisp
the
brew
is
light
in
body
and
highly
carbonated
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
go
well
with
most
foods
m
great
mouthcoating
good
medium
body
only
drawback
is
a
slight
sting
on
the
tongue
pours
with
minimal
head
but
does
leave
some
lacing
behind

to
dark
brownorange
in

seem
opaque

sweetness

with
only
a
breeze
of

however
comes
across
as
watery
and
semidilute
very
initial
impression
of
warm
chocolate
cake
coffee
and
marzipan
falls
off
a
cliff
by
the
midpalate
solid
jolt
of
carbonation
tries
to
waken
the
patient
also
appears
to
shuffle
towards
an
uptick
of
bitterness
at
the
end
but
doesnt
quite
get
there
decent
graininess
not
flawed
or
nothing
just
boring
this
beer
poured
a
ruby
brown
color
and
was
topped
off
with
a
very
creamy
good
carbonation
theres
some
roastiness
and
caramel
notes
in
the
aroma
but
overall
weak
in
that
regard
is
this
a
porter
or
a
brown
ale
im
not
sure
i
could
distinguish
but
it
doesnt
matter
because
the
flavor
is
very
pleasant
roasted
chocolate
toffee
burnt
coffee
come
through
with
a
nice
underlying
bitterness
very
drinkable
and
well
made
i
would
buy
this
again
and
would
love
to
session
it
highly
recommended
beer
and
i
will
make
a
it
a
staple
cant
understand
the
b
rating
its
a
easy
a
this
beer
surprised
me
and
was
very
interesting
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
and
try
it
again

a
nice
beer
overall
in
all
not
a
bad
beernot
one
ill
go
far
and
wide
to
get
but
i
say
that
as
much
about
the
style
which
has
never
been
very
high
on
my
list
as
about
the
beer
not
bad
and
worthy
of
a
shot

not
too
persistent
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
miso
and
fruit
maybe
lemon
flavor
lives
up
to
the
promise
of
the
aroma
and
color
being
fairly
strong
and
malty
with
an
undertone
of
caramel
and
just
a
slip
of
sweetness
texture
is
tingly
and
smooth
leaving
a
satisfying
finish
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
black
color
that
is
amber
when
held
to
the
light
one
inch
head
that
goes
down
quick
with
no
lacing
very
malty
aroma
that
smells
like
chocolate
and
bread
also
has
tastes
of
chocolate
caramel
and
toasted
grains
the
beer
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
it
is
one
of
the
only
nonwatery
abita
beers
easy
to
have
3
or
4
in
a
sitting
being
a
lover
of
brown
ales
this
is
a
goto
beer
for
me
its
not
overly
complex
but
it
packs
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
for
such
a
small
ale
im
almost
surprised
that
this
isnt
classified
as
an
aba
id
like
to
see
an
imperial
version
of
this
beer
called
turbogod
btw
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
a
brown
ale
although
i
would
probably
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
it
again
nothing
about
the
beer
jumps
out
at
me
as
being
particularly
memorable
not
bad
not
great
just
okay
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
this
brew
has
good
atmosphere
and
alot
of
flavor
complex
nose
really
good
drinkability
good
quaff
abv
might
be
a
bit
high
for
the
style
drinkability
is
quite
good
the
tastiest
abita
product
thus
far
all
in
all
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
especially
since
i
picked
this
one
up
without
even
reading
the
label
or
knowing
the
style
i
tried
turbodog
at
the
bourbon
street
distillery
in
downtown
indy
it
is
a
great
place
to
have
a
beer
before
the
colts
game
this
brew
is
malty
it
is
very
dark
in
color
with
a
rich
flavor
and
brisk
hop
finish
its
so
good
we
came
back
and
had
another
d
a
decent
beer
and
probably
one
of
the
few
brown
ales
that
i
like
well
enough
to
have
again
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
scent
is
toasted
malts
with
faint
chocolate
the
taste
is
strong
of
coffee
chocolate
toasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
more
carbonated
than
i
expected
not
real
thick
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
thats
not
too
filling
however
the
high
carbonation
is
a
little
much
d
grows
on
you
as
it
warms
in
your
glass
getting
a
bit
more
spicier
as
it
warms
a
great
brew
try
one
on
the
aroma
roasty
and
nutty
the
taste
was
crisp
up
front
then
finished
with
a
malty
sweetness
in
the
mouth
it
was
pretty
lively
then
left
maltiness
on
the
tongue
not
a
bad
english
brown
but
a
step
below
the
samuel
smiths
d
this
beer
really
tasted
good
although
it
was
not
what
i
expected
when
i
saw
a
brown
ale
none
the
less
it
was
good
still
i
have
to
dock
points
for
the
carbonation
levels
in
this
beer
best
of
the
abita
beers
d
drinkable
but
not
overly
memorable
enjoyable
and
i
would
gladly
welcome
another
pint
though
im
not
sure
ill
seek
out
to
purchase
notes
from
122807
the
aroma
has
toasted
malt
raisins
caramel
paper
and
basement
smells
the
appearance
is
dark
red
brown
with
a
large
foamy
head
the
flavor
has
toasted
malt
chocolate
nuts
and
some
paper
a
nice
beer
overall
but
the
palate
is
a
little
thin
and
the
taste
has
paper
to
distract
from
the
positive
qualities
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
as
ive
already
stated
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
can
now
see
why
this
is
abitas
flagship
beer
turbodog
has
a
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
that
fits
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
nothing
outstanding
about
the
way
that
this
one
feels
nothing
wowing
just
averagegood
as
it
should
be
this
is
one
that
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
again
a
great
beer
easy
to
drink
nice
to
session
and
one
of
the
better
abita
beers
in
my
opinion
i
believe
that
this
is
their
best
beer
i
can
see
why
my
wife
liked
this
so
much
i
like
it
too
overall
if
they
were
to
ever
make
a
soupedup
version
of
this
ale
and
call
it
an
old
ale
or
a
barleywine
id
be
over
the
moon
turbodog
is
great
though
surprisingly
easydrinking
for
its
heaviness
and
its
strength
dynamite
with
a
range
of
foods
too
everything
from
ovenroasted
eggplant
to
white
chocolate
challah
bread
pudding
purchased
a
single
in
solvang
california
poured
dark
brown
with
a
small
frothy
head
head
disappeared
after
the
first
miniute
or
so
it
smells
and
tastes
of
chocolate
and
toffee
with
some
woodiness
i
thought
finshes
somewhat
smooth
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
browns
taste
and
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
though
short
on
flavor
it
has
the
feel
and
taste
of
a
flat
cola
without
the
sugar
and
all
the
acid
this
is
my
first
tasting
of
an
abita
beer
and
it
will
no
doubt
be
the
last
time
i
buy
a
beer
from
them
serving
bottle
12oz
bottle
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
body
with
a
thin
film
of
light
tan
head
smells
very
malty
with
caramel
toffee
and
brown
sugar
ruling
very
pleasing
tastes
like
caramel
toffee
and
brown
sugar
with
some
hints
at
chocolate
and
coffee
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
definitely
disappears
before
im
ready
to
see
it
go
a
flavorful
quaffable
easy
drinking
beer
one
ill
definitely
be
getting
again
one
of
the
finest
brown
ales
ive
had
and
definitely
makes
me
think
twice
about
the
quality
of
beers
in
the
south
awesome
brew
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
cant
really
find
anything
wrong
here
this
is
one
that
we
used
to
enjoy
in
college
as
a
special
treat
and
it
still
doesnt
disappoint
d
this
is
my
first
official
review
of
the
style
that
being
said
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
affordable
widely
distributed
and
something
i
could
drink
with
some
regularity
certainly
worth
checkin
out
if
you
can
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
smell
is
of
ripe
fruit
taste
is
quite
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
tobacco
there
is
also
a
touch
of
earthy
flavor
from
the
hops
nice
bitterness
that
clings
to
your
tongue
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
slightly
high
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
good
beer
a
nice
example
of
an
english
brown
ale
but
a
bit
on
the
high
side
of
abv
notes
one
of
my
personal
favorites
and
my
go
to
english
brown
ale
a
pleasure
to
have
dquite
good
its
too
bad
i
lost
so
much
on
the
kitchen
floor
d
imo
it
is
a
great
brown
ale
and
perfect
for
a
quality
session
needless
to
say
even
better
on
tap
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
back
in
the
day
and
just
seeing
the
bottle
or
hearing
the
name
gives
me
a
good
vibe
perhaps
my
personal
history
coupled
with
the
region
lend
me
to
be
a
little
bias
however
for
these
personal
reasons
and
the
fact
i
firmly
believe
it
is
a
solid
around
beer
i
would
proudly
put
it
in
my
top
ten
additionally
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
very
accessible
and
unique
beer
from
a
great
brewery
from
the
depths
of
the
south
came
this
bottle
of
suds
into
my
pint
glass
it
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
the
nose
was
semisweet
like
chocolate
chips
accompanied
by
some
bread
toffee
and
caramel
notes
the
flavors
were
similar
but
the
sweetness
took
a
back
seat
biscuit
malt
and
bittersweet
chocolate
a
la
baking
along
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
a
good
beer
for
the
style
an
english
brown
ale
and
quite
sessionable
flavor
though
is
quite
nice
though
this
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
quite
nicely
a
very
nice
chocolate
toffee
creamy
goodness
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
all
around
i
would
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
candy
indeed
i
enjoyed
this
one
with
a
spicy
bowl
of
jumbalaya
you
should
too
fairly
mouth
filling
but
not
cloying
in
any
way
good
carbonation
present
i
enjoyed
it
but
with
the
selection
at
hand
i
went
on
to
a
different
brew
i
think
i
could
do
a
couple
but
thats
it
very
good
beer
overall
the
hoppiness
reminds
me
more
of
an
american
brown
than
an
english
one
as
does
the
slightly
elevated
alcohol
content
a
good
beer
with
the
veggie
pizza
i
ate
with
it
though
a
more
traditional
brown
ale
would
probably
have
paired
better
still
turbodog
is
a
decent
quaffer
and
is
duly
wellknown
abroad
here
in
the
us
drinkability
a
nice
overall
chill
and
unwind
beer
served
in
a
tumbler
poured
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
at
the
base
of
the
glass
1
5
inch
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
gradually
collapsed
into
a
dense
half
inch
cap
in
under
a
minute
before
settling
into
a
mere
slick
some
strands
of
lacing
which
gradually
slid
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
back
into
the
brew
nose
is
predominantly
chocolate
malt
with
perhaps
a
light
floral
hops
aroma
at
the
back
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
chocolate
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
insinuated
pleasantly
bittersweet
and
earthy
mouthfeel
falls
between
lightand
mediumbodied
with
a
balanced
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
to
remind
you
what
you
just
drank
nice
example
of
the
style
and
very
drinkable
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
tints
that
you
could
see
when
held
up
to
light
a
semitan
onefinger
head
that
died
at
a
medium
pace
and
left
some
lacing
a
sweet
smell
like
coffee
cocoa
caramel
honey
toffee
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
hint
of
hop
spice
too
a
tad
syrupy
as
it
passed
my
tongue
but
id
still
say
it
had
a
strong
medium
body
that
wasnt
overpowering
and
had
some
mild
sweetness
in
it
definitely
some
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffeeroasted
malt
for
a
semidry
backbite
although
the
backbite
also
had
a
little
fruitiness
to
it
hit
me
like
a
chewy
bready
doughy
goodness
that
backbite
did
a
good
beer
and
better
than
the
overhyped
purple
haze
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
think
ill
revisit
it
some
time
grape
juice
this
beer
tastes
like
grape
juice
not
entirely
but
thats
the
dominant
flavor
i
checked
the
label
to
see
if
maybe
this
beer
was
past
the
bestby
but
the
date
markings
on
the
edge
of
the
label
were
unnotched
oh
well
in
addition
to
the
concorde
grapes
theres
also
a
dry
cocoa
flavor
so
really
this
beer
tastes
like
welchs
grape
juice
with
nestle
quik
this
beer
is
a
nice
dark
brown
and
looks
chocolatey
on
its
pour
the
nose
and
taste
follow
suit
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
flavor
or
aroma
but
what
is
there
is
choclatey
and
malty
the
taste
is
sort
of
darkbitter
dry
chocolatey
and
has
malty
notes
the
hop
balances
this
off
though
and
keeps
it
from
approaching
the
toosweet
range
though
the
hops
used
arent
anything
known
for
writing
home
about
the
mouth
is
pretty
moderate
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
you
really
notice
the
bitter
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
drinkability
is
just
a
bit
above
average
its
def
not
bad
but
doesnt
really
make
you
want
to
drink
more
the
restraint
on
the
chocolate
and
sweetness
is
really
its
most
impressive
point
d
a
nice
beer
overall
worth
a
revisit
down
the
road
medium
bodied
brew
but
it
came
across
a
little
flat
overall
a
fairly
good
beer
that
im
not
so
sure
i
got
the
best
representation
of
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
d
a
flavorful
brew
but
the
mouthfeel
didnt
wholly
suit
the
tastes
going
on
and
the
bitterness
was
a
little
rougher
than
what
id
look
for
in
a
brown
ale
its
a
dark
malty
beer
with
a
lessfilling
profile
easily
drinkable
would
go
nicely
with
a
steak
a
yummy
brown
ale
drinkability
very
easy
drink
and
great
interpretation
of
the
style
a
must
try
brown
ale
this
poured
up
a
nice
muddy
brown
with
some
dark
red
highlightsa
thick
milk
chocolate
looking
head
builds
to
a
fingers
worth
before
deflating
to
a
thin
coveringwith
no
lace
left
behind
the
nose
is
thin
and
malty
with
some
very
faint
vinilla
notes
this
has
some
good
nutty
flavors
as
well
as
bitter
chocolate
and
subtle
dry
oat
tendencies
the
body
is
a
bit
to
thin
as
well
as
some
understated
carbonation
makes
it
just
slightly
above
average
at
best
the
alcohol
seems
well
hiddeni
was
a
bit
suprised
to
see
the
avb
above
six
a
decent
offering
to
enjoy
once
or
twice
maybenever
going
to
be
a
regular
in
my
glass
cheers
its
a
dark
malty
beer
with
a
lessfilling
profile
easily
drinkable
would
go
nicely
with
a
steak
d
decent
a
little
too
overwhelming
to
consume
regularly
d
notes
as
someone
previously
said
in
a
review
a
nice
little
session
beer
i
would
agree
easy
to
drink
and
the
price
is
right
d
its
ok
this
is
a
brown
ale
that
will
deliver
on
expectations
of
the
english
brown
ale
style
yet
probably
will
not
surprise
anyone
with
a
resounding
wow
or
anything
like
that
a
solid
example
of
the
style
it
is
refreshing
and
i
will
buy
more
di
like
it
quite
easy
to
drink
i
am
impressed
because
i
am
not
drawn
to
this
style
drinkability
its
crisp
for
such
a
malty
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
entirely
manageable
but
the
flavors
and
complexities
arent
too
terribly
interesting
again
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
and
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
the
feel
of
the
drink
is
on
the
thin
side
of
mediumbodied
with
a
clean
finish
easy
drinker
this
is
a
smooth
fullbodied
beer
that
is
a
little
sweet
and
nicely
balanced
as
a
dark
brown
ale
drinkability
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
that
i
would
enjoy
again
mouthfeel
is
great
with
some
zesty
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
cant
believe
its
above
6
what
does
this
brew
normally
cost
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
reasonably
flavorful
this
one
is
easy
to
share
at
parties
a
gateway
beer
a
great
combination
of
flavor
variety
and
character
balanced
make
this
highly
drinkable
only
downside
is
just
a
notch
too
low
of
flavor
intensity
for
my
liking
which
also
seemed
to
contradict
the
appearance
not
as
fullflavored
as
some
of
the
other
abita
offerings
but
decent
d
not
bad
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
it
pretty
much
drinks
like
a
lighter
beer
but
looks
like
a
porter
its
rather
odd
in
my
opinion
d
a
decent
drinkable
brew
flavorful
and
smooth
brown
ale
very
nice
smell
hazelnut
coffee
chocolate
nice
red
color
thick
head
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
with
tastes
of
chocolate
malt
candy
sugar
some
ripe
fruits
finish
has
a
slight
taste
of
hops
nice
smooth
brown
ale
very
nutty
very
good
not
too
shabby
d
the
light
body
makes
it
quite
drinkable
but
the
lackluster
flavor
development
is
disappointing
still
ive
almost
put
the
whole
thing
down
in
3
minutesa
quaffable
brown
ale
for
sure

drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
the
alcohol
is
relatively
low
and
flavors
are
pretty
easy
to
consume
a
nice
little
session
beer
ok
folks
this
hits
a
southern
english
brown
well
some
off
flavors
too
strong
in
abv
and
a
bit
hoppy
for
that
style
but
hey
this
is
a
very
clean
tasting
brew
purhaps
its
the
pristine
artisian
waters
the
brewery
claims
to
use
whatever
it
is
its
a
nice
effect
overall
i
thought
this
brew
was
surely
unique
and
did
enjoy
it
however
couldnt
drink
more
than
couple
d
easy
to
put
this
down
which
surprises
me
i
like
it
but
i
have
had
better
dark
brews
d
because
it
is
so
thin
it
is
easily
drinkable
the
abv
will
catch
up
with
you
after
a
few
but
i
can
drink
this
it
is
nothing
spectacular
but
it
is
a
good
beer
o
i
actually
found
this
one
to
be
pretty
easy
drinking
a
solid
offering
and
a
good
example
of
an
americanmade
brown
simple
and
unoffensive
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
nice
pour
with
a
12
inch
tan
head
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
toffee
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
followed
by
a
decent
nutty
flavor
creamy
mouth
feel
with
minimal
carbonation
nice
drinkable
beer
definitely
worth
trying
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
beer
out
there
within
the
style
will
finish
this
six
pack
off
but
will
probably
not
pick
up
again
d
i
am
not
a
bit
english
brown
ale
fan
so
i
had
to
fight
not
to
abuse
the
brewer
for
my
taste
buds
however
i
felt
the
watery
mouthfeel
thin
and
unbalanced
flavors
and
sour
aftertaste
took
away
from
what
could
have
been
an
interesting
beer
it
was
a
beauty
coming
out
of
the
bottle
but
that
was
the
highlight
jarlsberg
and
wildflower
cheddar
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
upon
first
glance
this
beer
was
very
dark
nearly
black
held
up
to
the
light
i
saw
a
lovely
ruby
red
hue
very
nice
head
that
stuck
around
smells
sweet
with
a
hint
of
fruit
kind
of
like
a
fruity
coffee
but
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
a
little
on
the
boring
side
the
most
noticable
taste
seems
to
be
that
of
the
alcohol
not
bad
but
i
expected
a
little
more
flavor
from
this
brown
ale
that
being
said
it
is
not
too
heavy
in
the
mouth
and
not
too
light
overall
not
bad
i
could
see
it
as
a
good
session
beer
for
a
dark
ale
dark
brown
colored
ale
with
a
thick
foamy
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
nuttiness
taste
is
nuttybiscuit
and
toffee
this
ale
is
as
smooth
as
ice
from
the
first
to
last
sip
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
i
will
definetly
buy
this
again
and
recommend
to
my
buddies
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
worth
a
try
d
the
smell
and
color
are
nice
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
undrinkable
d
this
is
an
easy
drinker
the
first
craft
brews
that
i
liked
were
brown
ales
and
i
still
dont
mind
kicking
them
back
drinkability
yeah
could
drink
a
few
but
there
are
other
things
out
there
a
dark
caramel
brown
color
topped
off
with
a
tad
of
foam
the
aroma
is
light
but
pleasing
with
a
mixture
of
graininess
and
roasted
malt
slightly
toasted
flavors
of
caramel
and
coffee
there
is
an
underlying
bitterness
which
provides
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
a
very
drinkable
and
subtly
pleasant
beer
very
nice
probably
will
give
it
one
more
try
then
write
it
off
not
a
bad
beer
though
that
odd
metallic
flavor
that
i
have
noticed
in
other
abita
beers
is
present
but
this
is
something
to
look
for
if
in
the
texas
or
louisiana
areas
good
drinkability
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
and
the
subtelty
of
the
taste
go
well
for
dinner
with
ribs
or
something
of
the
sort
nice
to
finally
try
one
after
hearing
so
much
about
it
lived
up
to
the
reputation
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
the
head
was
average
and
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
quite
faint
i
pick
up
some
light
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
wood
the
taste
is
surprising
light
for
such
a
dark
beer
some
light
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
touch
smokeywoody
the
feel
is
fairly
light
and
quite
fizzy
reminds
me
of
carbonated
water
the
brew
finishes
quite
neutral
and
balanced
no
great
aroma
or
flavors
but
this
is
a
damn
easy
drinking
brew
i
found
it
very
refreshing
since
the
turbodog
is
so
heavy
it
would
be
difficult
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
would
go
well
with
a
hearty
meal
on
a
cold
day
very
tasty
too
over
the
top
in
abv
and
all
these
areas
to
be
even
a
northern
english
brown
but
you
slap
american
brown
on
the
label
or
in
your
mind
when
drinking
this
and
youve
got
a
pretty
good
beer
some
nice
notes
in
this
and
when
followed
up
with
pizza
wash
down
duties
it
worked
out
well
d
this
is
a
really
nice
and
surprising
brown
theres
some
interesting
complexity
of
malt
and
hops
going
on
here
that
are
very
subtle
it
really
toes
the
line
between
the
english
browns
and
some
of
the
hoppier
american
varieties
as
well
this
would
be
really
great
with
roasted
or
grilled
foods
its
kind
of
a
goofy
name
but
its
pretty
good
ale
this
is
a
decent
and
drinkable
brown
ale
but
not
my
favorite
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
i
love
this
brew
especially
for
only
7
506p
i
have
to
exercise
some
control
when
drinking
it
because
of
the
body
its
so
delicious
but
too
many
and
im
doubled
over
and
altogether
asleep
for
the
night
very
drinkable
for
the
first
one
or
two
and
an
awesome
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
hop
bite
in
a
good
american
brown
ale
enjoy
d
i
drink
a
sixer
of
these
quite
often
with
no
problem
its
the
best
available
brew
in
my
area
and
i
have
fond
memories
of
drinking
these
during
various
trips
to
nola
especially
during
jazzfest
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
abita
brews
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
down
here
in
the
south
a
good
beer
but
going
into
i
was
told
it
was
a
chocolate
stout
i
couldnt
taste
any
chocolate
nice
to
say
ive
had
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
d
deffinetly
one
of
the
best
abita
has
to
offer
a
great
taste
and
not
too
hard
on
the
tongue
or
on
the
stomach
i
say
a
6pack
will
do
a
good
beer
for
dark
ale
lovers
d
a
nice
drinkable
brown
sort
of
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
a
beer
that
would
pair
nicely
with
a
freshly
cooked
steak
easytodrink
brown
ale
and
average
for
an
english
brown
ale
i
think
the
one
i
was
served
was
perhaps
a
bit
past
best
by
date
only
because
it
was
a
chain
restaurant
where
most
people
probably
dont
ask
for
it
still
i
liked
what
i
had
even
if
it
was
maybe
a
little
funky
pours
out
a
dark
clear
ruby
red
with
a
decent
though
looseish

is
roasty
and
fruity
for
the
most
part
with
a
healthy
dose
of
nuttiness
as
well
flavour
is
not
quite
as
roasty
as
expected
but
still
has
some
of
that
toasty
character
including
nuts
and
some
coffee
overall
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
brew

i
just

i
wasnt
impressed
with
this

very
mild
carbonation
theres
nothing
like
a
nice
malty
brown
ale
this
one
smells
like
tootsie
rolls
i
will
attribute
that
to
the
crystal
and
chocolate
malts
as
i
start
to
drink
it
i
can
see
some
lacing
begin
to
form
the
flavor
is
rich
round
and
full
toasted
chocolate
malt
with
a
nice
dry
touch
of

mouthfeel

i
would
compare
this
to
sammy

extemly
drinkable
very
tasty
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
had
to
date
an
underrated
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
starts
off
well
enough
but
closes
weak
would
have
probably
been
better
fresher
is
my
guess
but
isnt
that
always
the
case
pours
out
a
wonderful
brown
color
very
opaque
but
not
too
dark
a
nice
head
with
good
lacing
as
well
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
to
it
at
first
but
becomes
more
hoppy
as
you
get
into
it
a
very
good
brown
ale
flavor
with
a
slight
caramel
hint
it
goes
down
fairly
well
but
a
little
rough
notes
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
many
others
overemphasize
the
nuttiness
which
is
characteristic
of
this
ale
turbodog
is
more
balanced
and
smooth
an
easy
drinker
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
the
more
highend
browns
but
this
could
be
a
good
one
all
evening
would
be
perfect
for
a
cookout
dthe
best
abita
i
have
had
and
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
it
is
thick
without
being
heavy
d
quenching
and
carbonated
with
a
mellow
relaxed
flavor
a
bit
restrained
but
still
drinkable
a
good
brown
but
not
really
one
that
seems
to
fit
the
name
turbodog
i
guess
that
is
the
sign
of
how
beer
evolves
since
i
remember
enjoying
this
more
years
ago
when
i
first
got
into
craft
beer
smells
malty
tastes
malty
then
chocolate
then
a
bit
of
hops
followed
by
a
lingering
sweetness
all
very
pleasant
tastes
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
but
a
little
lighter
than
i
would
prefer
quite
drinkable

going
to
have
to
try
other
abita
brews

di
am
impressed
im
wrapping
up
a
sampler
of
abita
beers
that
i
have
been
reviewing
the
past
week
and
this
clearly
is
the
crown
jewel
of
what
i
have
tried
borders
on
porter
land
as
it
is
very
rich
and
tasty
a
must
try
beer
for
anyone
who
likes
this
style
and
even
if
you
dont
its
still
worth
trying
now
i
have
to
admit
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
going
into
this
as
i
had
stared
at
it
on
the
shelf
for
years
but
never
really
gave
it
a
try
had
no
inclination
as
to
what
kind
of
style
it
was
so
i
was
essentially
flying
blind
into
this
one
poured
a
nice
deep
hazelnut
brown
with
a
very
fluffy
and
frothy
off
white
colored
head
that
grew
to
a
height
of
around
two
inches
or
so
a
gradual
fade
left
behind
some
nice
side
glass
lace
as
well
as
a
touch
of
frothy
stuff
over
the
top
it
was
somewhat
cloudy
obscuring
most
of
the
view
of
the
interior
smell
was
interesting
i
definitely
picked
up
a
hop
presence
some
touches
of
orange
and
grapefruit
however
they
were
very
light
and
were
mostly
overpowered
by
a
sugary
caramel
aroma
lots
of
malt
here
with
even
a
slightly
noticeable
roasted
nut
aroma
the
taste
followed
suit
nicely
for
a
light
brown
ale
main
backbone
consisted
of
earthy
grain
type
flavors
that
were
lightened
up
with
a
healthy
dose
of
sugar
there
was
definitely
some
nice
hops
added
in
as
there
was
a
good
little
bite
to
it
in
the
front
and
it
gave
a
nice
long
drawn
out
finish
great
feel
as
there
was
more
then
ample
carbonation
in
this
one
and
it
hung
around
until
the
very
end
no
slickness
and
a
good
medium
to
light
body
an
excellent
session
ale
it
was
neither
overpowering
nor
too
light
to
be
noticed
overall
i
actually
thought
this
was
rather
nice
it
was
pretty
much
a
nice
normal
light
brown
ale
that
had
some
hops
thrown
in
for
balance
only
but
stayed
pretty
much
true
to
its
roots
this
was
an
excellent
little
brew
and
i
would
surely
have
one
again
would
probably
be
top
notch
on
tap
and
i
will
need
to
find
that
out
one
day
but
definitely
a
good
call
and
one
you
should
try
pours
a
dark
brown
with
light
ruby
highlights
small
off
white
head
aroma
was
of
slight
nuttiness
and
roasted
malt
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
taste
was
simple
some
grains
roasted
malt
and
nuts
theres
a
bit
of
nuttiness
on
the
very
end
a
decent
brown
ale
nonetheless
oddly
enough
my
freakin
hot
wife
who
likes
michelob
ultra
thought
this
stuff
was
pretty
good
go
figure
d
easy
to
drink
several
of
this
one
nothing
complex
about
it
but
it
is
a
good
satisfying
session
beer
an
easy
drinker
though
probably
nothing
to
rave
about
wellcrafted
but
i
could
live
if
i
never
had
one
again
overall
this
is
fine
it
has
nice
flavors
easily
drinkable
as
it
isnt
too
rich
its
gonna
go
well
with
lunch
today
smooth
enough
vaguely
drinkable
better
than
macrobrew
swill
so
i
guess
ill
finish
it
nice
dark
brown
with
amber
glares
pours
out
a
thick
frothy
head
that
oddly
disappears
rather
quickly
chocalate
malt
dominated
the
smell
and
there
is
little
to
no
hop
character
the
first
two
out
of
the
six
pack
did
not
impress
me
but
the
third
which
i
have
right
now
in
the
pilsner
in
front
of
me
has
definatley
made
its
review
alot
better
its
probably
the
mouthfeel
and
the
smooth
sweet
after
taste
that
has
changed
my
mind
about
this
one
another
six
pack
might
do
the
trick
a
thick
offwhite
head
formed
on
the
pour
with
nice
lacing
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
glow
and
nice
clarity
the
aroma
is
chocolately
mediumhigh
and
there
is
a
mediumlow
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
slightly
roasted
moderate
chocolate
and
has
moderate
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
rather
dry
and
a
little
alcohol
warmth
kicks
in
at
the
swallow
the
body
is
mediummediumfull
and
carbonation
moderate
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
i
especially
like
the
way
it
finishes
ill
need
to
upgrade
from
a
single
to
a
6er
the
beer
pours

color
with
a
very
nice
chocolaty
and
coffee
aroma
the
taste
is
very
close
to
the
smell
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
the
coffee
with
a
tinge
of
caramel
flavor
in
there
finishes
nice
and
smooth
with
a
little
bite
on
it
and
a
good
aftertaste
i
drank
the
beer
a
little
warm
because
i
was
a
bit
impatient
when
i
got
home
to
get
it
cold
but
i
think
if
it
were
a
little
bit
colder
it
would
be
good
d
very
high
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
somewhere
second
to
bells
best
brown
give
it
a
try
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
good
sized
off
white
head
nose
is
sweet
chocolately
and
somewhat
bready
an
odd
combo
but
it
is
pleasant
taste
is
of
sweet
chocolate
malts
with
a
very
slight
hop
balanced
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
would
not
have
guessed
it
was
above
6
abv
but
there
you
go
this
is
a
smooth
highly
drinkable
beer
which
probably
explains
a
lot
of
my
college
behavior
that
i
recommend
to
fans
of
brown
ales
its
not
as
creamy
or
fullbodied
as
some
but
its
quite
nice
and
goes
down
easy
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
not
much
lacing
smell
was
coffee
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
alittle
smoke
taste
was
the
same
predominantely
sweet
malts
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
lighter
than
expected
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
which
was
surprisingly
refreshing
for
the
style
would
like
to
try
more
from
this
line
worth
a
shot
drink
this
one
was
pretty
easy
to
put
back
it
was
near
100
outside
yesterday
too
usually
i
shy
away
from
brown
ales
during
the
hot
summer
days
but
this
one
didnt
make
me
feel
over
full
d
i
could
definitely
see
drinking
this
again
probably
not
too
often
but
its
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace

that
has
a
good
amount
of

the

the
taste

much
of
the
same
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
that
were
present
in
the
aroma
with
a
slightly
bitter

the
mouthfeel
is
heavily
carbonated
and
slightly
fizzy
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
that
is
definitely
recommended
very
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
longlasting
head
nice
lacing
on
glass
rich
taste
of
roasted
malt
good
mouth
feel
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
i
know
some
people
lump
abita
beers
with
bmc
but
that
is
unfair
this
is
a
good
tasty
beer
would
pair
well
with
the
fare
at
the
abita
brew
pub
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
the
initial
aroma
is
like
fairly
strong
coffee
followed
by
some
bitterness
i
really
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
taste
but
is
not
too
strong
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
definite
coffee
taste
and
some
bitterness
at
the
end
has
a
fairly
heavy
mouthfeel
to
it
and
does
not
have
all
that
much
carbonation
despite
this
it
is
not
very
hard
to
drink
at
all
and
has
a
very
interesting
taste
to
it
as
i
stated
before
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
worth
trying
only
microbrew
ive
had
with
twistoff
bottle
caps
pours
a
dark
brown
with
offwhite
head
that
it
did
not
retain
for
long
minimal
carbonation
very
smooth
and
drinkable
with
light
body
and
mouthfeel
reminded
me
a
bit
of
newcastle
but
not
as
sweet
i
liked
it
not
much
aroma
overall
a
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
brown
ale
d
probably
very
drinkable
once
it
settles
and
decarbonates
a
little
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
and
would
suspect
its
a
lot
more
drinkable
inquantity
on
tap
a
great
brown
ale
thats
maybe
a
bit
sugary
and
slightly
heavy
but
otherwise
a
great
beer
d
not
the
most
flavorful
brown
but
no
slouch
a
nice
flavor
and
feel
interesting
brown
ale
lots
more
character
than
most
very
soft
palate
silky
smooth
but
with
some
burrs
here
and
there
somehow
good
body
and
thin
at
the
same
time
poured
with
a
dnice
light
tan
head
and
just
a
little
lace
nice
mild
aroma
tasty
chocolately
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
licorice
and
ripe
dark
fruit
mild
carbonation
easy
finish
d
a
good
beer
i
became
reaquainted
with
it
has
been
years
since
i
tasted
this
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
more
mahogany
than
brown
in
color
and
has
a
creamy
bubbly
lightbrown
head
very
nice
looking
the
smell
is
also
quite
nice
caramel
and
biscuit
notes
which
produce
a
slightly
sweet
malty
nose
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
very
malty
and
the
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
no
discernable
hoppiness
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
in
body
with
a
creamy
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
is
a
decent
offering
d
this
is
a
great
drink
flavorful
yet
mild
with
a
sweet
malty
body
i
am
disappointed
that
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
around
to
this
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
pretty
good
drinkability
is
good
far
from
a
session
beer
but
it
goes
down
easy
overall
its
a
pretty
good
offering
for
the
style
id
drink
it
again
d
the
light
chocolate
malt
flavors
and
interesting
mouthfeel
make
this
a
highly
drinkable
brew
i
like
it
although
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
my
mind
got
this
one
after
running
through
the
other
60
beers
at
fox
and
the
hound
my
local
pours
a
fairly
average
brown
with
some
highlights
a
little
bit
of
respectable
lacing
that
follows
a
small
head
nose
is
very
mild
a
hint
of
malt
taste
is
likewise
fairly
good
malt
and
maybe
a
touch
of
nuttiness
feel
is
too
thin
overall
not
a
bad
one
but
not
a
great
one
either
go
for
the
troegs
rugged
trail
instead
turbo
dog
seems
an
overaggressive
name
for
whats
fundamentally
a
gentle
and
sweet
mild
but
give
these
guys
some
credit
for
working
up
something
truly
special
quite
easy
to
drink
nothing
spectacular
but
quite
pleasant
ill
enjoy
this
beer
again
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
it
doesnt
take
you
breath
away
but
its
a
good
beer
nonetheless
d
because
it
saturates
the
tongue
with
maltflavor
it
is
hard
to
drink
too
many
and
still
enjoy
what
flavor
is
there
pours
a
dark
woody
red
with
a
tanned
head
that
fizzles
out
to
a
ring
in
mere
seconds
aroma
is
of
sweaty
socks
herbal
hops
caramel
cheap
white
wine
and
grain
flavors
start
off
overbearingly
sweet
with
that
good
ol
abita
sweet
n
low
flavor
there
is
some
hinted
at
chocolate
in
the
malts
but
it
gets
too
grainy
too
quick
has
a
weird
taste
of
yeast
that
one
would
find
in
shitty
homebrew
finishes
with
hints
of
robutussin
and
rubber
bands
mouthfeel
is
thin
extremely
slick
and
lacking
carbonation
no
thanks
drink
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
brown
ales
nice
complex
malt
flavor
that
is
not
overly
complicated
very
smooth
and
drinkable
but
just
a
little
light
bodied
compared
to
some
other
browns
tasty
and
what
i
thought
was
sessionable
until
i
saw
the
abv
level
which
is
obviously
wellhidden
a
solid
example
of
the
style
d
not
a
bad
brown
ale
it
doesnt
look
overly
impressive
but
it
delivers
a
good
taste
probably
one
of
my
favourite
brown
ales
and
brown
ales
arent
really
my
bag
had
in
bottle
quite
a
few
times
but
i
honestly
love
it
on
tap
in
nawlins
it
has
a
very
friendly
taste
and
it
looks
stunning
with
its
dark
brown
body
and
thick
proud
head
is
somewhat
roasty
and
very
drinkable
i
prefer
it
served
real
cold
so
as
it
warms
so
do
you
whats
that
raspberries
in
the
aroma
yeah
and
in
the
quaff
too
although
thin
and
weak
just
a
offside
note
of
chocolate
and
coffee

but
way
off
dry
and
crisp
this
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
on
but
i
suppose
it
would
make
a
good
summer
session
brew
down
south
if
youre
buying
ill
have
another
dpretty
smooth
and
frefreshing
could
drink
several
in
a
row
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
i
could
down
this
all
night
im
glad
i
decided
to
try
this
a
second
time
when
i
had
it
ontap
it
wasnt
bad
but
seemed
more
bland
that
this
while
i
tend
to
choose
porters
and
stouts
more
than
brown
ales
id
definitely
drink
this
again
i
have
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
for
a
while
but
hadnt
had
it
in
at
least
six
months
the
beer
was
served
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
head
that
slowly
diminished
but
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
strong
on
black
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
toffee
the
taste
was
also
strong
on
toffee
and
chocolate
with
plenty
of
black
malt
present
as
well
this
beer
is
almost
on
the
borderline
between
a
porter
and
a
brown
ale
the
beer
is
nice
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
and
the
6
is
well
hidden
i
have
always
found
this
as
a
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
redish
highlights
and
large
three
finger
light
tan
head
that
holds
to
about
a
half
inch
with
not
a
lot
of
lacing
some
fruity
aromas
along
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
a
slightly
bitter
chocolate
is
there
as
well
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
a
standout
drinkability
fairly
easy
to
drink
its
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
good
finish
but
the
carbonation
hides
that
a
little
bit
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
on
the
back
label
poured
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
had
a
good
sized
tannish
head
the
smell
was
very
weak
almost
undetectable
the
taste
pretty
much
followed
the
smell
i
kept
thinking
man
this
is
watery
and
without
taste
mouthfeel
was
watery
got
to
say
id
rather
have
a
miller
lite
than
this
ive
liked
other
abitas
but
this
misses
the
mark
by
a
mile
dont
recommend
even
to
knock
off
list
2
na
ml
n
a
sweet
english
brown
or
light
american
brown
its
okay
i
dont
need
another
pours
a
bit
darker
than
most
browns
ive
had
a
small
but
clingy
tannish
head
sticks
around
for
a
bit
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
not
much
else
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
coffee
the
taste
isnt
much
more
complex
but
thats
not
to
say
it
isnt
a
smooth
enjoyable
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
browns
but
this
one
i
did
enjoy
appearance
is
a
deep
dark
chocolate
with
a
reasonable
sticky
head
smell
is
espresso
roasted
malt
and
not
a
lot
more
the
malt
profile
is
a
nice
balance
of
caramel
and
coffee
and
a
modest
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
substantive
but
it
is
betrayed
by
a
slightly
overbearingly
crisp
bubbliness
this
notwithstanding
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
a
decent
brown
that
could
be
used
to
hook
macrodrinkers
without
scaring
them
off
im
a
bit
late
posting
this
in
honor
of
mardi
gras
but
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
from
the
louisianan
abita
like
most
abitas
however
this
is
where
the
goodness
ends
the
taste
is
of
dull
nutty
malts
and
lackluster
hop
notes
theres
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
not
much
feel
to
this
beer
in
the
way
of
complexity
its
somewhat
crisp
and
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
overall
it
misses
the
mark
but
still
a
decent
effort
by
the
la
brewery
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
forming
a
12
inch
head
that
left
medium
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
imo
is
like
a
cross
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
stout
light
nutty
flavor
but
with
the
taste
of
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
interesting
but
i
love
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
being
about
right
for
the
style
maybe
slightly
heavier
than
normal
overall
this
would
be
a
great
session
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
recommended
a
mild
perfume
type
aroma
a
minimal
frutiness
and
malty
taste
with
a
burnt
caramel
finish
quite
dry
and
scratchy
going
down
too
bad
i
dont
have
anything
else
to
say
this
is
a
good
beer
but
if
you
want
something
substantial
this
is
not
really
it
taste
goes
well
with
food
beats
macros
but
i
can
think
of
other
brown
ales
that
have
more
going
for
them
cheers
p
s
this
was
excellent
with
a
wedge
of
wellaged
parm
of
course
the
nutty
notes
found
in
both
aged
parm
and
brown
ale
are
always
excellent
together
but
i
was
pleased
with
the
two
together
here
once
again
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
tan
bubbly
head
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malts
graze
the
nose
creamy
large
and
massive
carbonation
yet
simplistic
for
the
style
caramel
malts
and
cocoa
with
light
roasted
coffee
beans
in
the
initial
sips
the
body
is
bland
a
touch
of
nutty
flavorings
somewhat
watereddown
with
toffee
malts
and
traces
of
oats
incredibly
boring
skip
this
overrated
beer
the
second
beer
of
the
party
pack
that
im
trying
and
the
second
beer
that
im
not
all
that
fond
of
pours
a
nice
thick
creamy
head
taste
more
like
a
stout
than
a
ale
if
you
like
stouts
its
ok
but
it
is
not
something
that
i
will
be
bringing
home
at
every
oppurtunity
i
think
the
name
targets
the
younger
crowd
i
think
i
will
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
more
coffee
and
roasted
malt
across
the
bow
of
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
nicely
thick
and
surprisingly
smooth
if
blindfolded
i
would
never
know
this
was
an
abita
brew
its
not
stupendous
nor
is
it
a
brown
ale
but
it
tastes
good
and
goes
down
very
easy
if
youre
down
on
the
pelican
states
big
gun
give
this
dog
a
shot
i
think
i
might
have
developed
a
bias
towards
abita
beers
though
ill
have
to
try
them
again
in
a
blind
tasting
this
was
my
first
time
trying
a
beer
from
abita
i
will
ave
to
make
a
greater
effort
into
locating
more
of
their
products
i
got
this
12
ounzer
from
the
abita
party
pack
at
kunda
bev
and
poured
it
into
a
large
20
ounze
glass
from
there
i
found
that
there
wasnt
much
head
the
retention
was
also
rather
fast
there
wasnt
even
a
speck
of
lace
i
am
finding
out
that
these
are
charateristics
of
most
abita
brews
the
smell
hinted
at
coffee
or
something
of
that
nature
the
taste
was
a
bit
malty
but
not
to
powerful
the
thickness
of
the
brew
lead
to
a
nice
mouthfeel
a
drinkable
brew
dont
drink
and
review
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
flavor
personally
i
am
not
a
fan
of
chocolaty
flavors
overall
a
good
brown
ale
recommended
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
color
and
has
an
off
white
head
the
head
is
pretty
decent
and
lacing
was
average
chocolate
type
smell
kind
of
reminds
me
of
hot
cocoa
chocolate
theme
carries
over
in
the
taste
department
and
has
a
nice
even
smooth
flow
going
down
one
of
the
better
dark
beers
ive
had
very
very
drinkable
excellent
session
beer
particularly
for
its
price
around
66pack
d
a
very
good
brown
ale
i
could
easly
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
upon
first
glance
this
beer
was
very
dark
nearly
black
held
up
to
the
light
i
saw
a
lovely
ruby
red
hue
very
nice
head
that
stuck
around
smells
sweet
with
a
hint
of
fruit
kind
of
like
a
fruity
coffee
but
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
a
little
on
the
boring
side
the
most
noticable
taste
seems
to
be
that
of
the
alcohol
not
bad
but
i
expected
a
little
more
flavor
from
this
brown
ale
that
being
said
it
is
not
too
heavy
in
the
mouth
and
not
too
light
overall
not
bad
i
could
see
it
as
a
good
session
beer
for
a
dark
ale
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
tonight
alone
more
than
i
have
in
the
past
at
the
pubs
i
think
i
had
better
selections
to
choose
from
on
tap
and
it
never
lived
up
in
flavor
to
the
others
certainly
very
drinkable
but
there
are
better
combinations
of
flavors
for
my
tongue
notes
so
far
i
believe
this
is
their
best
offering
of
the
5
ive
tried
browns
are
not
usually
high
on
my
list
of
favorite
styles
but
when
done
well
i
can
appreciate
the
quality
this
is
far
from
touching
some
of
the
better
browns
but
its
decent
and
worthy
of
a
purchase
poured
with
some
head
that
dismantled
quickly
left
a
thin
line
of
lacing
a
dark
body
but
with
some
highlights
to
the
colour
fairly
deep
for
the
style
an
almost
scotch
ale
like
aroma
comes
across
as
american
not
like
the
classic
british
renditions
the
combination
of
malts
make
for
a
rough
ended
flavour
non
too
harmonious
in
the
least
a
cocacola
like
character
initially
sticky
mouthfeel
fades
with
the
use
of
spring
water
the
alt
yeast
comes
through
on
the
finish
and
leaves
a
lingering
distinctness
from
the
initial
flavour
impressions
the
flavours
hold
together
quite
well
but
just
dont
blend
as
a
medley
more
of
high
school
garage
band
practice
i
appreciate
the
makeup
smart
work
but
a
dissatisfying
result
thanks

the

with
the
many
flavors
and
smells
mixing
perfectly
this
may
be
the
best
english
brown
ale
brewed
in
america
cheers
overall
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
on
pour
into
nonic
glass
it
produced
med
carbonation
and
a
two
finger
head
that
collapsed
to
about
12
but
was
persistentclinging
color
was
a
deep
brown
aroma
was
a
pleasing
sourness
i
think
the
alt
yeast
at
work
here
coffee
notes
taste
was
exceptional
i
immediately
detected
fruit
stone
fruits
plum
and
then
bitter
chocolate
nice
hop
finish
with
the
williamette
being
a
good
choice
for
this
ale
a
more
citricflowery
variety
would
have
detracted
from
the
above
flavor
components
drinkability
enhanced
by
the
smoothness
of
this
ale
a
distinct
slider
i
think
this
is
a
unique
beer
in
that
it
has
some
english
brown
ale
qualities
but
the
alt
yeast
gives
it
more
complexity
an
overall
good
beer
a
good
contrast
to
the
american
brown
ale
style
as
this
is
the
sweeter
maltier
english
version
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
perhaps
a
good
introduction
for
coffee
drinkers
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
deep
shades
of
red
shining
through
when
held
to
the
light
a
sturdy
tan
head
forms
on
top
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
caramel
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
medium
to
light
body
and
mouthfeel
a
sweet
malty
flavor
gives
way
to
a
light
cocoa
and
coffee
flavor
as
it
warms
these
flavors
give
a
bigger
showing
a
good
brown
ale
that
almost
borders
on
a
porter
would
definitely
buy
again
and
probably
will
the
next
time
the
bbq
is
sparked
up
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
chocolate
malt
and
toffee
are
predominant
but
they
give
way
to
a
coffee
finish
a
bit
heavier
even
for
a
brown
ale
but
it
goes
down
very
well
unfortunately
i
tried
it
on
a
hot
day
id
definitely
prefer
it
on
a
crisp
autumn
evening
a
very
solid
beer
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
abitas
main
3
beers
a
big
plus
is
that
its
relatively
cheap
around
here
so
i
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
d
very
drinkable
as
a
session
and
relatively
inexpensive
with
a
good
depth
of
flavor
a
delicious
english
brown
ale
that
stays
true
to
the
style
abita
does
not
dissapoint
with
this
one
this
beer
poured
a
nice
deep
black
color
with
a
persistent
head
the
smell
was
slightly
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
was
a
combination
of
malt
coffee
sweetness
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
heavy
and
chewy
i
consider
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
but
could
be
biased
because
i
grew
up
near
the
brewery
and
on
this
beer
beautiful
deep
rich
brown
but
you
can
still
see
through
it
nice
head
deep
color
tight
bubbles
fair
lasting
power
good
lacing
smells
deeply
malty
nice
sweet
caramel
tastes
hmm
deeply
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
you
get
darker
malts
chocolate
coffee
maybe
a
hint
of
burnt
caramel
as
well
as
the
caramel
definitely
not
overbearingly
caramel
or
sweet
nice
medium
mouth
could
be
a
good
drinker
all
year
ive
heard
a
lot
of
people
buzzing
about
this
beer
so
i
thought
i
would
try
it
now
that
ive
found
it
somewhere
grabbed
a
six
pack
of
bottles
today
the
beer
is
a
nice
looking
brown
with
a
fairly
decent
head
and
lace
the
smell
is
a
bit
faint
but
has
a
chocolate
wheat
much
expected
from
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
suprisingly
good
some
brown
ales
are
just
a
bit
too
sweet
or
too
much
this
one
is
a
nice
light
crispy
tasting
mix
of
chocolate
and
toffee
wheat
without
being
sticky
or
boggy
its
refreshing
and
thats
not
something
you
can
say
of
a
brown
ale
very
often
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
for
a
brown
ale
but
is
absolutely
nothing
to
complain
about
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
on
a
hot
muggy
day
served
ice
cold
this
is
made
for
all
the
people
who
want
something
refreshing
after
a
hard
days
work
but
cant
stand
the
pilsners
nice
beer
worth
a
try
overall
a
nice
surprise
a
good
uppermiddle
class
brown
ale
a
solid
brown
ale
nothing
outstanding
but
very
pleasant
to
drink
mostly
harmless
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
light
creamy
head
chocolate
toasted
malt
smell
with
hints
of
grainy
hops
a
nice
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
a
fruity
bite
to
the
finish
the
feel
is
slightly
creamy
and
fresh
not
the
cleanest
finish
but
not
a
bad
after
taste
so
its
ok
in
all
its
not
the
most
refreshing
beer
but
the
flavor
is
good
its
a
great
example
of
brown
ale
its
certainly
worth
a
drink
d
great
with
a
poboy
or
some
seafood
perfectly
drinkable
yearround
a
nice
effort
by
abita
probably
the
best
of
their
regulars
pours
out
with
about
2
inches
of
head
has
a
dark
brown
color
to
it
darker
than
most
in
this
style
smell
comes
out
with
slights
amount
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
is
detected
the
taste
starts
off
with
rich
malty
taste
the
malts
make
for
a
sweet
beginning
to
a
drink
with
caramel
undertones
again
the
end
has
a
nice
bite
of
hops
this
is
appreciated
the
mouthfeel
feels
a
little
bit
too
much
like
water
but
is
not
like
a
bud
light
by
any
means
this
is
a
beer
a
guygal
could
session
on
all
night
long
i
do
enjoy
browns
for
being
what
they
are
simple
tasty
and
versatile
this
brown
does
better
than
most
at
that
drinkable
ill
just
say
that
im
not
happy
that
ive
still
got
5
of
these
left
in
the
fridge
overall
a
brew
that
gets
the
basic
taste
right
but
lacks
in
intensity
a
quick
pour
yields
a
two
finger
head
which
falls
to
one
and
lasts
the
head
is
the
color
of
heavily
creamed
coffee
the
body
is
deep
black
showing
only
hints
of
garnet
when
backlit
appears
more
like
a
stout
than
a
brown
smells
roasty
and
sweet
with
bits
of
toffee
and
caramel
could
be
richer
taste
is
mellow
but
dominated
by
roast
to
the
point
of
the
beer
being
more
a
porter
than
a
brown
an
enjoyable
bitterness
though
mouth
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
lend
a
nice
smoothness
a
drinkable
possibly
miscategorized
beer
that
i
dont
think
ill
be
reaching
for
again
drinks
okay
reminds
be
of
new
castle
brown
but
with
more
flavor
well
worth
a
try
havent
had
a
whole
bunch
of
abita
but
this
one
is
my
favorite
beautiful
brown
color
smell
is
not
very
appealing
nice
and
strong
but
a
little
sour
tastes
strongly
of
coffee
with
a
little
chocolate
behind
it
average
mouthfeel
for
a
dark
beer
extremely
drinkable
another
solid
offering
from
abita
but
i
wish
they
would
have
done
a
little
more
with
this
this
brown
ale
pours
to
a
brownish
amber
color
with
thick
tan
head
that
quickly
shrinks
to
a
tan
ring
around
the
glass
and
good
lacing
malty
aroma
with
some
nut
and
caramel
although
it
was
hard
to
pick
out
any
particular
flavor
the
overall
taste
was
good
finish
was
slightly
watery
but
good
and
long
lasting
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
12
oz
bottle
this
doesnt
look
much
like
a
brown
ale
dark
brown
off
white
head
not
much
aroma
at
all
faintly
like
chocolate
taste
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
maybe
a
little
carmel
the
hops
are
overwhelmed
by
the
roasted
malt
seems
lighter
bodied
than
i
would
expect
and
the
carbonation
really
stands
out
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
as
it
seems
a
little
unusual
but
it
wont
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
a
darker
brown
ale
with
slivers
of
light
shining
through
and
a
small
light
tan
head
the
smell
was
not
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
not
a
whole
lot
besides
some
caramel
and
malty
sweetness
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
than
the
smell
with
a
good
amount
of
the
caramel
malt
pulling
through
and
balanced
well
with
the
hops
of
the
brown
ales
ive
tried
this
was
certainly
not
my
favorite
but
it
was
still
quite
good
i
could
go
for
this
again
sometime
although
this
style
isnt
my
favorite
its
one
where
im
rarely
disappointed
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
turbo
dog
pours
a
mahogany
color
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
it
has
a
nice
aroma
with
some
toffee
and
chocolate
like
smells
nice
flavor
too
chocolate
like
flavors
maybe
some
toffee
flavor
too
i
like
this
beer
its
definitely
worth
a
try
had
this
on
tap
at
crawdaddys
in
milwaukee
wi
this
ale
was
very
dark
brownblack
with
brown
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
it
had
a
pleasant
roastedchocolate
scent
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
watery
overall
not
as
thick
as
it
looked
but
still
pretty
good
for
an
american
brown
ale
it
had
no
hop
presence
that
i
could
taste
but
perhaps
the
extreme
maltiness
was
overpowering
the
hops
flavor
the
flavor
was
exquisite
i
tasted
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
i
thought
this
was
an
amazing
beer
its
definitely
near
the
top
of
my
list
as
far
as
must
haves
drinkability
is
ok
better
browns
are
available
not
really
bad
but
nothing
to
make
you
want
to
try
it
again
in
my
opinion
atleast
not
when
its
sitting
beside
a
good
brown
at
my
grocery
store
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
light
comes
through
as
ruby
red
minimal
tan
head
quickly
recedes
smell
is
a
mixture
of
cocoa
sweet
and
hops
bitter
taste
is
nutty
and
malt
up
front
but
finishes
with
some
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
well
balanced
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
ok
beer
but
doesnt
really
grab
me
pours
a
deep
redbrown
color
with
an
epic
head
of
cocoa
nose
is
very
malty
with
mollasses
and
roasted
nut
accents
nice
aroma
palate
is
thick
and
sweet
upfront
strong
roasted
malt
flavors
along
with
the
sweetness
override
the
hops
finished
surprisingly
dry
though
has
a
medium
feel
but
id
say
its
on
the
lighter
side
when
contemplated
longer
this
one
isnt
bad
really
and
an
appropriate
brew
for
the
restaurant
for
sure
the
cajun
tuna
steak
was
the
highlight
here
though
not
the
beer
give
it
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
th
menu
good
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
small
hoppy
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
and
it
is
a
great
brown
ale
id
imagine
this
is
highly
drinkable
good
flavor
nice
finish
too
bad
i
only
had
one
a
favorite
among
the
patrons
at
the
c
b
they
almost
always
have
a
tap
on
this
and
always
fresh
you
come
on
wednesdays
its
5
liter
night
and
i
always
get
a
liter
of
turbodog
perfect
example
of
a
brown
appears
a
dark
mahogany
brown
with
ruby
highlights
has
a
nice
tan
cream
head
leaves
behind
sparse
lacing
aroma
has
herbal
hops
with
a
chocolate
nutty
edge
to
it
very
nice
mix
of
dark
toasted
malts
and
a
light
hop
profile
taste
contains
caramel
chocolate
tones
from
the
excellent
malt
profile
this
is
definitely
an
old
stand
by
from
the
brown
ale
category
herbal
hop
finish
very
definitively
one
of
the
best
browns
ive
tasted
straight
outta
louisiana
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
syrupy
texture
that
stays
on
the
palate
a
bit
longer
than
the
typical
craft
ale
drinkability
is
wonderful
challenging
to
the
senses
yet
groundbreakingly
good
and
refreshing
on
multiple
levels
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
and
definitely
the
local
beer
i
go
for
when
visiting
the
crescent
city
body
pours
a
deep
nearopaque
brown
with
a
solid
tan
head
smells
clean
dry
a
little
metallic
taste
starts
a
little
sweet
but
thats
followed
quickly
by
a
sharp
roasty
bite
a
little
fuzzy
and
drytoasty
feeling
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
but
that
sharp
roast
really
jumps
out
turbodog
is
a
serviceable
brown
ale
but
nothing
outstanding
the
caramel
and
malt
profiles
are
a
bit
week
but
its
rather
true
to
the
style
very
dark
reddishbrown
with
1
cm
of
creamy
tan
slowly
diminishing
head
smell
is
mostly
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
light
sweetness
and
some
fruit
dark
bread
toffee
brown
sugar
caramel
and
nuts
the
taste
follows
suit
with
dark
bready
malts
taking
centerstage
supported
by
a
very
light
hops
presence
and
a
touch
of
earthy
yeast
it
has
a
mediumfull
mouthfeel
lightly
syrupy
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
quite
enjoyable
probably
my
favorite
of
the
abita
mix
case
so
far
final
thought
this
beer
is
unbelieveable
it
tastes
like
a
hybrid
porterale
and
is
one
to
be
purchased
when
seen
without
a
doubt
i
am
a
member
of
the
beer
of
the
month
club
and
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
that
came
in
the
first
month
i
have
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
ever
since
i
enjoy
the
slight
chocolate
smell
and
taste
of
the
beer
i
was
never
a
dark
beer
drinker
until
i
tasted
turbo
dog
i
now
cant
get
enough
of
the
dog
i
have
turned
on
quite
a
few
on
my
friends
to
this
tasy
beverage
now
too
it
is
hard
to
find
this
beer
where
i
am
from
but
when
i
do
get
some
it
is
a
very
welcome
treat
i
havent
been
really
impressed
by
the
other
abita
beers
this
beer
however
was
a
welcome
suprise
this
beer
begins
with
a
deep
rich
smell
dark
and
malty
looking
it
poured
average
but
really
shines
on
the
initial
taste
good
amount
of
flavor
with
nice
roasted
undertones
medium
carbonation
and
mediumlight
body
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
good
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
kind
of
weak
but
nice
chocolate
malt
with
toffee
and
some
wierd
ripe
funk
that
isnt
altogether
bad
taste
has
a
bready
malt
character
with
chocolate
hints
some
toffee
decent
medium
body
and
a
little
action
on
the
tongue
overall
pretty
decent
brown
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
rich
amber
hues
and
a
decent
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
laces
nicely
the
smell
is
mild
nuttiness
and
coffee
aromas
same
flavors
appear
as
in
the
smell
and
they
are
once
again
mild
its
a
little
watery
but
not
too
bad
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
better
brown
ales
out
there
although
this
one
is
like
a
cross
between
a
porter
and
a
brown
ale
probably
most
similar
to
harpoons
munich
type
dark
but
not
as
good
this
beer
was
well
before
the
date
of
caution
and
i
had
my
wife
smell
and
taste
it
and
she
agreed
it
was
rank
my
conclusion
is
that
the
bottle
i
bought
was
infected
down
the
drain
it
went
actually
served
a
bit
too
cold
to
make
out
much
of
the
character
but
still
its
pretty
good
a
bit
of
spiciness
in
the
tan
foam
make
me
think
briefly
of
a
christmas
ale
a
general
hop
bitterness
is
apparent
at
the
first
taste
then
i
caught
some
good
chocolate
malt
with
very
little
astringency
looks
good
tastes
good
poured
a
small
head
with
only
a
ring
to
show
for
itself
even
after
a
hard
pour
color
was
a
well
highlighted
rubybrown
mix
this
color
allowed
some
cool
lacing
to
be
seen
when
held
to
the
light
the
smell
was
of
faint
bready
and
toasted
malts
with
an
aura
of
an
english
meadow
but
take
what
i
just
said
and
taint
and
water
it
down
a
lot
the
taste
was
of
burnt
toast
mixed
with
a
dickens
style
grool
please
sir
i
dont
want
some
more
i
shouldnt
say
that
this
beer
was
alright
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
to
get
an
idea
if
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
think
it
neesds
further
investigation
i
get
home
after
a
rough
day
at
class
and
open
my
fridge
for
something
to
drink
and
there
is
a
turbo
dog
staring
me
in
the
face
so
i
pop
the
top
and
pour
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
very
little
head
maybe
a
pinky
finger
which
disolved
into
thin
film
there
is
minor
lacing
the
beer
is
dark
brown
which
has
some
redish
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
malt
the
slightest
hint
of
chocolate
some
roasted
nut
sweetness
and
the
smallest
drop
of
some
hops
were
in
the
nose
the
first
part
of
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
some
sweetness
followed
by
some
nutty
chocolate
flavors
and
finishes
with
a
small
amount
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
very
little
carbonation
is
in
this
beer
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
beer
but
as
it
has
been
said
by
previous
reviewers
it
lacks
some
excitement
that
would
change
it
from
good
to
great
still
you
can
drink
many
of
them
without
a
problem
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
went
surprisingly
well
with
blueberries
and
strawberries
for
dessert
alas
it
is
not
all
that
interesting
nor
terribly
balanced
so
im
fine
with
one
or
two
of
these
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
huge
offwhite
foamy
head
with
better
then
average
retention
aroma
of
chocolate
malt
is
quite
distinctive
and
very
pleasant
taste
is
also
dominated
by
roasted
malt
with
some
chocolate
note
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
overall
this
is
probably
better
then
90
of
brown
ale
out
there
but
it
is
still
a
brown
ale
which
just
doesnt
get
me
excited
all
in
all
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
havent
been
really
impressed
by
the
othe
abita
beers
i
have
has
so
far
so
this
beer
was
a
welcome
suprise
this
beer
begins
with
a
deep
rich
smell
dark
and
malty
looking
it
poured
average
but
really
shines
on
the
initial
taste
aftertaste
lingers
very
short
so
that
finish
is
clean
appearance
is
almost
opaque
but
not
quite
with
ruby
tints
the
chocolate
malt
in
this
brew
is
evident
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
taste
a
little
toasty
too
i
feel
like
it
could
have
benefited
from
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
mallt
not
a
bad
beer
fairly
drinkable
i
liked
this
beer
much
more
than
i
remembered
it
i
bought
a
6pack
the
other
nighton
sale
for
5
99
and
it
poured
a
thick
blackishbrown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
left
a
lacing
around
the
glass
the
smell
of
of
slightly
sweet
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
very
faint
smell
nothing
that
really
stood
out
but
good
none
the
less
the
first
taste
to
hit
your
tongue
is
of
malt
chocolate
and
maybe
toffee
or
carmel
malts
too
lightly
hoped
in
the
body
the
after
taste
is
what
does
it
for
me
a
nice
dark
chocolatey
after
taste
that
is
slightly
bitter
mouthfeelis
thick
and
wonderful
the
light
hops
mellows
the
malt
and
makes
it
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
brown
ale
but
a
very
dark
one
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
cheap
craft
brewsyou
can
find
it
in
charleston
for
like
6
99or
less
all
the
time
d
this
had
some
interesting
dark
malt
notes
that
were
nice
but
there
wasnt
enough
depth
or
character
to
them
the
hops
were
present
but
they
just
didnt
have
the
characteristics
of
hops
in
the
floral
and
aroma
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
on
tap
quite
often
at
a
restaurant
in
my
home
town
and
many
of
my
beer
bros
like
it
good
thing
i
like
it
since
it
is
around
quite
a
bit
i
am
not
sure
how
this
for
the
style
i
have
never
had
an
english
brown
ale
taste
like
this
pours
dark
brown
with
a
browntinged
head
short
and
foamy
smells
of
toasted
malts
mocha
grains
taste
is
pretty
good
coffees
slight
chocolates
maltiness
along
with
sweet
dark
wheats
and
maybe
a
hint
of
fruit
raisin
crisp
good
drinkability
probably
the
best
beer
that
abita
makes
its
a
medium
brown
hue
with
promising
head
retention
aromas
are
lightly
malty
toasty
nutty
and
caramelly
though
flavors
are
modest
they
are
clean
and
of
same
characteristics
in
the
nose
the
beer
waters
significantly
into
the
body
and
finish
it
looses
the
creaminess
and
maltiness
finishes
a
tacky
sweet
and
a
little
less
than
clean
though
not
great
its
fair
the
mouth
is
just
thick
enough
and
the
beer
is
interesting
enough
to
be
very
a
good
session
option
i
guess
emerile
knows
a
bit
about
beer
every
beer
from
the
abita
party
packed
has
sucked
so
now
i
will
try
the
only
one
with
the
cool
label
actually
some
really
nice
graphic
design
goin
on
here
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
good
mocha
colored
inch
deep
head
the
smell
isnt
that
much
different
than
the
other
abita
beers
why
do
they
all
smell
the
same
there
are
differet
styles
here
kinda
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
contains
that
same
abita
essence
that
the
other
abita
beers
also
except
this
one
has
a
hint
of
toasted
malts
there
is
some
decent
hoppage
at
the
end
that
saves
the
day
the
hint
of
coffee
is
nice
lightmedium
body
could
use
more
carbonation
but
not
bad
too
bitter
to
be
really
drinkable
fairly
unpleasant
fans
of
brown
ales
should
look
elsewhere
light
mouthfeel
with
heavy
carbonation
like
a
soda
heavy
coffee
flavors
with
a
balancing
chocolate
sweetness
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
not
incredibly
complex
or
rich
but
a
satisfying
balanced
flavor
goes
well
with
almost
any
dinner
d
a
really
like
this
one
a
very
good
brown
ale
drank
the
three
that
i
had
in
one
night
and
was
wanting
a
few
more
overall
this
is
one
i
should
get
more
often
than
i
do
i
think
its
the
best
regular
abita
beer
man
i
dont
know
what
it
is
with
abita
but
this
looked
and
smelled
great
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
and
sweat
chocolate
and
nuts
but
then
the
taste
is
just
a
train
wreck
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
it
can
go
from
smelling
and
looking
so
good
to
falling
short
so
fast
i
think
i
am
done
with
abita
they
cant
say
i
didnt
give
them
a
chance
though
not
a
bad
brew
especially
since
i
just
bought
it
because
of
the
name
will
try
some
others
from
abita
if
i
can
get
them
to
see
how
it
goes
beer
is
drinkable
would
be
more
enjoyable
in
the
summer
i
dont
agree
with
the
style
classication
the
malt
and
hops
spell
brown
ale
but
the
yeast
is
a
alt
really
you
could
just
say
the
hops
are
wrong
because
you
could
sub
the
malt
for
an
alt
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
burgundy
highlights
and
a
thin
film
of
off
white
head
smelled
of
smoky
chocolate
malts
with
a
touch
of
sourness
tasted
of
sweet
honey
and
a
slight
molasses
blended
into
a
delicate
crisp
and
dry
hops
this
was
followed
with
a
very
clean
sour
and
dry
finish
mouth
feel
was
light
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonation
the
flavor
is
very
simple
but
well
done
and
it
goes
down
very
easy
drinkability
i
have
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
since
joining
ba
years
ago
it
is
an
ok
brown
ale
but
i
have
had
many
better
very
good
basic
beer
honestly
i
didnt
notice
all
the
depth
of
flavors
that
were
going
on
in
this
but
definitely
smooth
and
hits
the
hell
out
of
the
spot
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
heavy
at
all
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
a
few
but
its
drinkability
wears
on
me
after
a
while
good
looking
brown
beer
with
a
shortlived
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
malty
odor
with
hints
of
nuts
strong
malt
and
chocolate
taste
with
lingering
aftertaste
weird
mouthfeel
thick
and
carbonated
good
drinkability
a
six
pack
wouldnt
last
long
in
my
fridge
although
i
dont
know
how
often
i
would
buy
it
nearly
opaque
dark
plumbrown
body
with
a
1finger
tan
head
low
retention
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
nose
of
chocolate
malt
slightly
nutty
and
offset
by
a
bit
of
hop
moderately
aggressive
carbonation
in
a
medium
body
slightly
acridic
toffee
and
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
slight
uplifting
hop
bitterness
thin
flavor
profile
for
the
style
but
easygoing
and
pleasant
making
it
easily
sessionable
this
beer
is
a
deep
molases
color
with
a
frothy
toasted
tan
head
the
nose
is
rasted
nut
with
a
hint
of
coacoa
the
taste
starts
bitter
with
hints
of
chocolate
before
going
to
a
more
roasty
nut
toffee
finish
this
is
probably
abitas
best
offering
one
is
great
but
there
is
something
which
keeps
this
from
being
very
drinkable
drinkability
while
this
brew
ended
up
being
merely
good

so
i
figured
id
give
this
dark
looking
brew
a
taste
you
could
easily
give
this
to
a
nonaledrinking
pal
and
have
them
polish
it
off
as
easily
as
a
domestic
light
beer
its
tasty
but
im
not
sure
those
cajuns
care
i
could
see
others
making
a
session
out
of
this
and
carbonated
for
my
taste
not
a
bad
taste
or
aftertaste
i
think
that
it
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style

it

that
this

really

better

at

of

with

smells
of

malt
with
some
slightly
nutty
hints
and
a
noble

finish
the
taste
is
very
nice
although
a
little
metallic
when
i
had
one
too
cold
as
it
warms
the
malt
comes
back
to
life
and
the
gentle
hop
finish
is
a
delight
good
drinker
with
maybe
just
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
a
few
tweeks
here
and
there
could
make
this
a
winner
the
samoset

me
has

a

taste

a

this
is

the
body
could
use
a
little
more
meat

otherwise
a
pretty
solid

drinkable
brew

poured
a
translucent
mediumbrown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
left
behind
some
nice
lacing
the
head
was
only
13
mm
thick
but
remained
for
some
time
aromas
of
burnt
toast
roasted
malt
and
salted
nuts
the
taste
was
dry
with
roasted
flavors
pairing
nicely
with
the
bitter
finish
subtle
flavors
of
nuts
biscuits
came
out
as
the
beer
warmed
slightly
chewy
texture
but
good
for
the
style
the
lack
of
pronounced
flavors
lends
it
to
be
had
a
few
times
with
ease
this
beer
is
much
bettter
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
though
im
not
sure
why
i
had
such
low
expectations
it
sits
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
light
a
fluffy
two
fingered
head
forms
and
gently
recedes
to
film
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
brown
sugar
on
top
of
a
fairly
nice
malt
bed
the
taste
is
full
of
a
very
complex
malt
base
with
a
nice
blast
of
brown
sugar
there
is
a
nuttiness
in
the
background
coming
from
the
malt
no
discernible
hop
element
it
finishes
much
the
way
it
starts
but
with
maybe
a
touch
of
a
metallic
taste
to
it
there
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
a
surprisingly
strong
burst
of
carbonation
holds
everything
together
drinkability
is
great
because
the
brown
sugar
and
malt
base
never
become
too
sweet
a
common
problem
in
browns
especially
without
a
hop
element
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
would
probably
be
sublime
on
cask
this
is
a
style
im
not
very
fond
of
but
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
it
again
pours

color

carbonation
huge
bubbles
like
you
see
in
carbonated
water
the
head
was
about
1
inch
but
quickly
fizzled
away
to
nothing
the
smell
reminds
me
of
toasted
bread
the
taste
also
has
a
toasty
flavor
which
has
some
burnt
notes
also
some
sweetness
too
mouthfeel
is

except
for
the
carbonation

this

aromas

wet
earth
some

taste
is

side
flavors
of
mild
malt
husk
grain
and
some
sweet
sugar
cane
blend
well
but
are
kind
of
uninspired
mouthfeel
was
accentuated
by
the
excellent
level
of

very

a
good
level
of
drinkability
i
dont
think
id
have
any
issues
having
a
few
of
these
a
good
session
beer
give
it
a
try
this
pours
a
dark
red
ruby
with
a
large
foamy
head
the
smell
has
some
malt
sweetness
and
fruitbut
it
is
not
very
strong
or
that
attractive
the
taste
has
some
sweet
malt
and
alot
of
carbonationbut
little
else
the
mf
is
light
with
a
taste
that
is
very
watery
this
is
a
beer
that
i
was
very
disappointed
in
the
smell
and
taste
are
very
slight
and
that
makes
this
beer
one
that
i
will
pass
on
in
the
future
this
is
decent
but
is
rough
around
the
edges
i
bet
its
pretty
damn
good
on
tap
when
fresh
this
bottle
has
a
best
by
date
on
it
but
alas
is
not
notched
drinkability
and
overall
a
nicely
balanced
brown
ale
that
is
easily
drinkable
definitly
one
id
recommend
to
anyone
who
wants
a
tasty
slightly
complex
session
brew
i
could
probably
drink
more
of
these
but
i
probably
wont
drinkability
is
verry
high
here
so
i
enjoyed
more
than
just
one
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
yeilding
a
very
nice
and
thick
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
nicely
toasted
malt
and
herbal
hops
in
the
nose
nice
clear
dark
copper
body
even
if
it
is
bottle
conditioned
toasted
malt
with
some
caramel
malt
in
the
front
with
decent
hops
backing
it
up
but
drops
off
the
deep
end
afterwards
the
finish
leaves
me
flat
kinda
disappointing
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
with
a
bit
of
hop
bite
to
finish
it
off
not
awesome
but
complex
and
tasty
id
like
to
see
them
kick
up
the
malt
a
bit
to
balance
the
with
the
hops
but
this
is
still
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
english
browns
beer
is
very
drinkable
good
the
grilled
chicken
sandwiches
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
a
gorgeous
deep
brown
ale
that
is
clear
and
clean
but
hard
to
see
through
due
to
the
rich
darkness
a
spitty
tan
head
caps
it
off
for
a
moment
but
ends
up
deflated
and
spattered
atop
the
lovely
juice
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
occasional
fat
bubbles
pop
off
here
and
there
but
overall
it
is
a
pretty
calm
brew
the
nose
is
very
pleasing
and
mild
a
somewhat
oaken
ambiance
supports
brown
sugar
and
nuttiness
a
bit
of
hop
character
comes
through
in
the
nose
as
well
lending
a
fresh
air
of
peaty
earth
the
flavour
is
very
pleasing
and
mild
also
the
sweetness
of
malt
and
brown
sugary
texture
make
up
the
brunt
of
the
taste
hops
lend
a
nice
subtlety
and
tip
the
scales
to
equilibrium
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
and
feels
a
bit
creamy
at
times
a
great
brown
i
had
forgotten
how
nice
these
could
be
i
thought
this
might
be
a
mild
and
im
really
surprised
it
surpassed
the
5
abv
level
pours
a
clearer
mohagany
color
with
a
moderate
airy
tan
head
aroma
is
nutty
and
sweet
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
then
some
roasted
malts
taste
begins
with
the
roasted
malt
flavor
then
goes
into
a
sweeter
brown
sugar
taste
earthy
hops
come
in
and
provide
excellent
balance
a
biscuity
yeast
flavor
lies
underneath
along
with
some
notes
of
almonds
finish
is
moderate
and
balanced
the
flavors
dont
really
last
but
each
provides
their
input
moderate
body
lighter
in
weight
yet
good
flavor
all
around
and
nothing
off
at
all
this
would
make
great
session
material
pours
a
translucent
deep
orange
with
reddish
highlights
topped
by
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
lingers
a
bit
nice
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
oak
and
light
coffee
mixed
in
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
palate
is
again
quite
roasty
on
the
front
mellowing
into
a
more
balanced
profile
as
the
hops
come
out
midpalate
finish
is
slightly
smoky
but
disippates
quickly
body
is
a
tad
foamy
but
still
nice
and
sturdy
not
exactly
phenomenal
but
then
again
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
though
readily
available
where
i
live
pours
well
very
little
head
on
it
and
carbonation
tastes
a
little
malty
at
first
then
the
hopss
kick
in
but
not
too
strong
a
very
dark
ale
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
malty
but
i
cant
really
complain
about
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
touted
as
a
real
ale
this
beer
looks
great
with
its
deep
auburn
color
and
filmy
thin
head
small
bits
of
carbonation
speckle
the
glass
the
aroma
is
appealing
with
a
sweet
malt
nose
and
a
sour
fruity
tang
hiding
in
there
somewhere
the
taste
is
almost
perfectly
balanced
bitter
earthy
hops
interlace
well
with
the
malt
base
a
somewhat
hearty
beer
but
remains
very
drinkable
an
almost
earl
grey
like
bitter
tea
sting
remains
in
the
back
of
the
throat
very
nice
and
a
fine
beer
on
all
counts
pours
a

i
would
have
again
i
agree
that
its
worth
a
try
a
few

drinkability
great
flavor
makes
great
drinkability
here
definitely
a
brew
to
find
and
enjoy
a
pleasant
surprise
to
find
in
a
local
story
nicely
done
this
brew
is
a
cherry
cola
color
with
a
medium
light
tan
head
thin
lacing
that
sticks
to
the
glass
pretty
well
the
aroma
is
very
nutty
along
with
some
malt
and
caramel
thin
at
times
and
fairly
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
smoked
character
nutty
and
sweet
malt
flavor
is
decent
but
shortlived
mildly
hoppy
finish
a
decent
session
beer
dn
nothing
really
jumps
out
as
being
either
good
or
bad
this
is
just
a
forgettable
ale
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
dark
ruby
color
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
has
some
roasted
malt
character
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
even
maybe
some
molasses
too
the
taste
has
more
of
that
roasted
malt
sweetness
its
not
too
strong
and
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
almost
a
touch
of
pecan
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
really
good
as
well
a
solid
brown
ale
medium
red
with
a
nice
head
of
offwhite
aromas
of
fresh
biscuity
british
malts
and
slightly
spicy
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
more
malty
than
hoppy
and
very
simplistic
and
uklike
as
many
maine
brews
are
this
reminds
me
of
a
quality
mildbitter
as
it
should
taste
is
malty
with
a
hop
kick
on
the
back

drinkability
is
good

i

this
one
ontap
at

deweys
color
is
a
dark
amberlight
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
retention
is
decent
and
there
are
a
few
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
a
nice
roasty
malt
really
comes
out
in
the
smell
accompanied
by
a
sweet
caramel
backing
notes
of
nuttiness
also
taste
follows
suite
with
a
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
over
a
sweet
backbone
it
is
also
nutty
and
bitter
pretty
flavorful
stuff
here
finishes
with
a
biscuity
malt
and
a
bit
of
roastiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
there
is
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
here
nice
drinkability
as
well
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
good
bit
of
complexity
to
it
while
remaining
easy
drinking
thanks
to
secret
santa
and
quarre
for
the
bottle
drinkability
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
so
im
ready
to
move
on
one
of
those
beers
where
you
play
guess
the
style
since
the
bottle
doesnt
identify
it
poured
a
dark
chestnut
pegged
this
as
a
brown
ale
right
off
the
bat
the
finish
to
this
brew
makes
up
for
it
with
a
crisp
bread
and
biscuit
like
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
bitter
spiciness
from
the
hops
carbonation
was
a
little
over
the
top
to
this
brew
which
took
away
a
bit
of
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
to
this
brew
overall
this
brew
was
fairly
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
get
that
carbonation
under
control

was
eager
to
try
out
this
one
and
review
it
and
some

in
there
as
well

was

it
was
rich

actually
had
a

it

i
have
always
loved
that
this
is
atlantics

beer
they
didnt
make
a
pale
ale
or
a
light
lager
to
sell
to
the
tourists
like
many
other
maine
breweries
they
made
their
signature

a

not
the

but
very
good
some
raw

qualities
which
taste
infinitely
more

than
they
sound
despite
big

presence
this
beer
is
not
at
all
cloying
hops
step
in
at
the
right
moment
to
cleanse
the
palate
and
leave
you
with
a
bitter

out
for
another
sip
this
is
a
serious
beer
for
serious
maine
weather
a
bright
summery
day
like
this
without
any
hops
jumping
out
at
you
this
beer
is
all
about
tase
sweet
and
malty
the

skinny
in
feel
to
the

finish
has
a

primarily
the

are
what
give
it

ahhh
trad
its
entirely
possible
that
ive
consumed
more
traditional
ale
than
any
other
beer
brewed
in
alberta
the
more
i
think
about
it
im
positive
that
is
the
case
im
reviewing
this
based
on
my
most
recent
tasting
during
the
intermission
of
the
best
of
banff
film
festival
along
with
distinct
palate
memory
trad
is
far
from
the
best
brown
ale
you
can
buy
it
pours
nicely
smells
like
yeast
and
malt
and
has
a
lovely
caramilk
and
walnut
flavour
to
it
its
the
granddaddy
of
alberta
craft
beer
and
still
a
solid
choice
30
years
later
overall
a
very
solid
if
unremarkable
english
brown
ale
i
would
recommend
it
one
of
the
first
non
yellow
fizzy
beers
i
had
this
beer
will
always
be
a
fav
it
has
a
nice
malt
flavour
and
is
always
available
in
a
pinch
pours
a
light
caramel
to
brown
light
for
the
style
with
two
fingers
of
butterscotch
foam
aroma
is
sweet
grainy
malt
artificial

extract
a
faint

mellow
toasty

carnival
peanuts
some
treacle
vanilla
toffee
notes
faint
earthy
hops
mouthful
is
quite
nice
actually
silky
smooth
and
decent
body
some
chewy
malts
an
underachieving
brown
ale
that
is
a
decent
sessional
if
one
is
in
an
old
school
pub
mood
lacks
nutty
punch
and
swings
way
towards
sweet
but
mellow
malt
not
a
remarkable
english
brown
ale
seems
to
be
an
ok
beer
i
havent
been
a
fan
of
brown
ales
ever
but
this
beer
does
not
lean
me
towards
them
any
further
pours
a
very
nice
translucent
dark
brown
however
my
pour
had
very
minimal
head
smells
malty
with
some
caramel
hints
good
flavor
of
deep
complex
malts
however
it
feels
very
thin
in
the
mouth
with
very
little
carbonation
for
me
this
is
the
biggest
downfall
of
the
beer
greetings
from
canada
pours
up
to
a
fizzy
buff

and
clear
light
brown
color
aroma
is
a
pleasing
blend
of
toasty
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
a
complex
blend
of
with
a
toasted
malts
caramel
nuts
butterscotch
and
enough
nondescript
hops
to
balance
the
whole
thing
out
mouthfeel
is
light
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
would
have
some
on
hand
at
all
times
if
i
could
also
noteworthy
was
that
this
beer
was
sampled
in
calgary
where
it
was
likely
just
days
from
the
brewery
so
it
was
very
fresh
tasting
overall
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
big
rock
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
balanced
taste
i
wont
rush
out
to
buy
more
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
its
along
the
same
lines
as
the
creemore
springs
beer
overall
4
my
favorite
local
brown
ale
and
a
flagship
beer
for
big
rock
great
value
for
the
price
having
a
very
enjoyable
taste
while
still
bring
extremely
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
session
ale
its
miles
ahead
of
the
newcastle
i
just
had
ill
have
to
remember
to
have
this
more
often
when
i
go
out
in
calgary
for
a
conference
and
tried
the
big
rock
traditional
ale
the
appearance
was
quite
good
a
rich
amber
color
and
thin
white
head
that
laced
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
little
undescripted
could
smell
the
hints
of
malt
the
taste
was
really
nice
a
good
malt
and
caramel
character
made
this
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
this
made
the
mouthfeel
very
easy
and
could
session
this
beer
with
no
problem
d
certainly
the
most
enjoyable
big
rock
brew
ive
come
across
yet
simple
but
flavorful
taste
and
easy
to
drink

the

the
taste
of
sweet

this
was
a
smooth
creamy
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
overall
a
local
brewery
that
i
would
support
if
all
beers
were
of
this
quality
cool
having
a
beer
from
alberta
though
did
the
trip
to
the
beer
store
for
this
and
i
just
might
pick
up
another
6
next
time
i
go
d
this
is
probably
my
favorite
offering
from
big
rock
so
far
but
thats
not
saying
a
whole
lot
their
beers
arent
bad
but
they
arent
anything
special
this
one
had
the
most
complex
flavor
and
aroma
compared
to
the
other
ones
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
and
a
good
choice
in
a
bar
full
of
macro
beers
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
with
some
decent
characteristics
this
is
a
worthy
beer
from
big
rocks
collection
well
carbonated
medium
body
make
for
a
nice
drinkable
fresh
glass
of
draught
nothing
outstanding
bus
as
one
of
the
most
commonly
found
taps
in
alberta
you
could
do
far
worse
on
tap
at
the
imperial
pub
in
toronto
pours
an
amberbrown
colour
with
very
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
pretty
quickly
leaving
almost
no
lacing
smells
of
sweet
caramel
toasted
barley
and
very
mild
hop
aroma
flavour
is
quite
sweet
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
as
i
used
to
drink
this
when
i
was
a
teenager
in
alberta
but
going
back
to
it
i
realize
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
objectively
not
worth
drinking
again
emotionally
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
drinkable
a
very
sessionable
beer
albeit
very
average
big
rock
traditional
was
in
fact
at
the
top
of
my
drinking
playlist
on
a
recent
trip
to
alberta
part
of
that
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
it
was
so
widely
available
in
particular
in
establishments
that
otherwise
didnt
offer
halfway
decent
beer
but
hey
in
the
world
of
widely
distributed
commercial
beers
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
a
lot
worse
d
quite
drinkable
one
of
the
better
brews
from
big
rock
d
drinks
quite
easily
wouldnt
be
a
bad
session
beer
drinkability
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
not
boring
i
can
pack
several
of
these
away
with
no
issues
nice
to
get
the
nutritional
information
on
the
box
as
well
actually
a
good
little
ale
great
for
a
session
i
had
no
problems
drinking
this
and
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
my
6
pack
not
the
best
brown
pale
out
there
but
certainly
a
fine
brew
overall
seems
like
an
average
eba
at
best
appearance
and
drinkability
are
the
highlights
but
both
the
nose
and
taste
are
watered
down
and
bland
theres
plenty
of
room
to
pack
more
flavour
in
for
sure
much
rather
have
rogue
black
oak
or
garrisons
eba
offering
final
thoughts
im
noticing
a
trend
with
big
rock
and
that
is
that
funky
malt
flavor
all
in
all
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
say
i
was
impressed
by
it
by
any
means
and
would
not
buy
this
beer
if
it
wasnt
in
the
mix
pack
worth
a
try
but
not
much
more
trad
is
the
industrys
standard
here
in
calgary
nothing
worth
bragging
about
but
nothing
too
be
ashamed
of
either
body
between
light
and
medium
low
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
put
back
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
poured
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
disappeared
quite
quickly
to
a
haze
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
body
was
very
clear
and
dark
amber
in
color
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
light
malt
and
hops
with
something
else
quite
pleasant
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
body
was
light
to
medium
on
the
palate
and
slightly
oilycreamy
with
lively
carbonation
nice
flavor
that
starts
off
slightly
sweet
but
finishes
with
a
light
bitterness
yet
short
duration
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
that
would
make
a
good
session
ale
although
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion
from
different
sources
over
exactly
what
class
of
beer
this
is
d
ill
need
to
pick
this
up
again
and
add
a
proper
appearance
note
but
as
for
the
other
aspects
of
this
beer
i
was
very
impressed
im
certain
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
but
i
find
this
beer
to
be
so
damnned
drinkable
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
anything
from
big
rock
big
rock
calls
this
an
english
brown
and
i
think
that
is
a
better
description
than
apa
it
compares
well
with
newcastle
maybe
a
touch
better
overall
it
is
fairly
average
but
a
safe
bet
it
is
available
everywhere
in
alberta
and
a
good
alternative
to
the
big
macros
overall
the
beer
is
on
my
growing
list
of
decent
but
sessionable
canadian
micros
this
beer
is
pleasant
to
drink
inoffensive
middleoftheroad
but
tasty
nonetheless
ill
note
that
im
not
reviewing
this
as
an
apa
as
the
brewer
doesnt
consider
it
one
its
closer
to
an
englishstyle
brown
and
it
hits
pretty
square
in
the
middle
for
that
style
its
characterful
enough
to
be
interesting
but
no
so
much
as
to
impede
drinkability
a
rather
easy
to
put
away
if
not
overly
complex
brown
ale
consistent
with
all
of
my
university
drinking
years
in
the
90s
i
will
credit
big
rock
with
providing
the
gateway
experience
that
allowed
me
to
enter
the
beerdrinking
world
without
first
having
to
endure
the
typical
smalltown
fate
of
bmconly
hegemony
and
while
i
will
always
prefer
it
on
tap
the
lower
carbonation
just
lends
itself
to
the
heady
malt
flavours
not
to
mention
the
memories
of
6
dollar
shared
pitchers
the
singleserve
packaging
is
just
as
enjoyable
right
here
and
now
d
if
you
are
looking
for
a
cheap
apa
with
an
unterrible
taste
this
is
the
beer
for
you
otherwise
stick
with
a
snpa
which
is
pretty
affordable
and
has
much
more
to
offer
d
while
i
like
this
beer
and
think
big
rock
has
done
a
decent
job
here
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
enjoy
this
all
night
as
it
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
however
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
say
bbqd
ribs
with
s
milder
sauce
as
well
this
would
do
nicely
as
an
after
dinner
drink
a
decent
brew
d
this
is
actually
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
big
rock
imho
but
still
far
from
fantastic
and
too
sweet
to
make
it
easily
drinkable
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
drinkable
beer
but
you
would
probably
be
looking
for
something
with
a
bit
more
flavour
in
your
next
one
a
decent
apa
from
an
unexpected
brewery
like
all
big
rocks
brew
overly
carbonated
i
sort
of
enjoyed
it
but
i
could
see
getting
pretty
sick
of
it
after
the
first
one
pours
a
nice
deep
mahogney
reddish
color
with
1
finger
tan
head
that
turns
to
a
thin
collar
and
stays
put
till
the
endsome
mild
lacing
nice
malty
smell
comes
at
you
with
some
sweet
fruits
blending
in
there
somewhere
and
some
caramel
and
prunes
taste
is
kinda
sweetish
to
start
and
the
malts
and
fruitness
kicks
in
along
with
a
tinge
of
caramel
and
some
mild
bitterness
and
finishing
off
dryvery
good
tasting
and
quite
enjoyable
medium
body
feel
to
this
one
and
some
mild
carbs
all
going
down
easilywould
make
for
a
good
session
beer
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
one
i
had
at
moxysthe
big
life
aleboth
made
by
big
rock
hmmmi
wonder
a
dark
brown
colour
with
a
light
brown
head
settled
with
some
lacing
moderate
carbonation
smells
of
rye
bread
caramel
mild
hops
nothing
to
write
home
about
bitter
in
the
mouth
with
a
bitter
finish
a
bit
of
a
cleansing
sensation
hints
here
and
there
of
caraway
seeds
and
melba
toast
not
great
not
bad
either
just
soso
d
kind
of
an
average
brew
not
macroboring
but
a
very
basic
beery
beer
that
doesnt
offend
this
beer
is
almost
reddish
in
colour
the
aroma
is
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
at
best
i
can
describe
slightly
malty
it
felt
perky
on
the
tongue
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
flavour
tasted
a
little
malty
with
hints
of
grass
and
orange
it
went
down
quite
well
however
pours
a
translucent
auburn
with
a
little
bit
of
head
not
much
creaminess
nose
is
fairly
hoppy
and
floral
as
well
as
noticeable
graininess
with
a
slight
bit
of
malts
taste
is
alright
mostly
hops
and
not
much
character
imho
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
an
ok
beer
this
is
a
common
beer
for
me
when
im
out
at
a
pub
that
has
mostly
macros
it
is
a
good
fallback
id
say
it
is
in
the
wrong
style
category
even
on
the
can
it
is
listed
as
an
english
brown
and
that
seems
about
right
to
me
may
explain
some
of
the
lower
scores
too
as
some
people
might
have
been
looking
for
a
hoppy
apa
final
statement
very
basic
sessional
ale
not
offensive
not
remarkable
good
companion
to
my
chilli
as
a
whole
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
characteristics
to
recommend
it
to
others
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
i
was
offered
one
last
notei
find
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
too
watery
pours
a
clear
reddish
copper
thin
white
head
forms
settles
to
a
decent
layer
no
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
citrus
and
toffee
not
much
going
on
some
grass
but
not
offensive
taste
is
stale
malt
figs
fruits
little
bit
of
citrus
kind
of
lemony
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
not
good
not
bad
just
kind
of
on
the
low
end
of
mediocre
but
as
expected
from
big
rock
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
very
small
light
tan
head
that
fades
quite
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
smell
is
very
malty
loads
of
caramel
and
nuttiness
but
not
a
whole
lot
else
taste
is
bready
at
first
touch
of
caramel
and
a
faint
metallic
note
barely
noticeable
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
slightly
undercarbonated
and
not
very
satisfying
and
drinkability
is
decent
about
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
big
rock
macro
quality
beer
in
micro
packaging
drinkability
as
ive
said
this
is
my
usual
so
i
think
it
is
highly
drinkable
awsom
with
sharp
cheese
or
nachos
i
think
this
is
the
best
of
the
big
rock
beers
that
i
had
on
my
trip
to
banff
dark
copper
colored
pale
ale
it
may
be
a
little
dark
for
style
but
a
strong
malty
base
give
the
beer
a
good
mouthfeel
sometimes
hard
to
find
in
canadian
beer
very
reminiscent
of
northwest
pale
ales
like
sierra
nevada
a
strong
aromatic
hop
but
not
overly
assertive
compared
to
the
fruity
esters
and
malty
base
of
the
beer
in
many
of
the
bars
this
became
my
back
up
beer
of
choice
and
on
tap
it
opens
up
a
bit
more
compared
to
the
can
i
am
reviewing
now
if
you
see
a
row
of
big
rock
and
sleeman
on
the
tap
go
traditional
decent
mouthfeel
with
some
good
cleansing
and
medium
bodied
overall
this
beer
is
ok
not
bad
in
a
pinch
nothing
too
exciting
appeared
more
like
an
amber
ale
with
a
translucent
copper
color
and
a
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
behind
moderate
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
enriched
milk
syrup
and
burnt
toast
not
very
appealing
the
combo
that
is
the
taste
was
mostly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
flavors
of
smoked
roasted
sugars
seemed
to
come
out
a
bit
astringent
though
and
somewhat
chalky
in
my
mouth
had
a
pint
of
this
and
i
didnt
want
another
seems
like
some
artifical
flavoring
was
added
to
this
one
with
the
subtle
taste
of
syrup
drinkability
an
easy
to
drink
and
easily
likeable
pa
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
local
drinkability
nothing
special
here
drank
half
of
it
and
used
the
rest
to
cook
our
pork
roast
in
regardless
this
ale
is
well
done
though
not
outstanding
it
makes
a
good
session
ale
and
is
easy
to
drink
a
nice
copper
coloured
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
tend
to
think
of
this
one
as
a
kind
of
supedup
and
less
adjunct
ladden
labatt
50
well
balanced
hop
and
breadymalt
flavor
and
the
carbonation
makes
it
quite
refreshing
tastes
quite
fresh
even
though
it
came
out
of
a
can
a
bit
watery
but
still
a
good
everyday
beer
bottled
samples
ive
had
have
been
a
little
inconsistent
but
the
can
and
draft
samples
have
been
far
more
reliable
d
more
flavour
than
a
macro
but
not
a
lot
it
shouldnt
offend
the
average
drinker
tastes
nice
and
toasty
bready
caramel
toasty
notes
and
a
good
bits
of
hops
at
the
finish
incredibly
drinkable
with
buddies
one
friend
commented
when
sharing
the
pitcher
i
have
to
stop
myself
it
just
dissappears
if
i
just
get
talking
and
forget
not
to
drink
very
true
i
had
two
of
these
one
each
on
seperate
nights
and
each
time
they
tasted
slightly
different
the
one
night
it
seemed
quite
bland
and
slightly
sweet
the
other
night
it
seemed
very
sweet
the
truth
is
probably
somewhere
in
the
middle
while
this
isnt
something
that
reaches
out
and
grabs
you
it
is
a
decent
beer
and
worth
drinking
on
occasion
d
i
really
thought
of
this
more
as
an
american
brown
ale
than
an
apa
it
had
much
more
malt
depth
with
hops
playing
a
nice
supporting
roll
it
was
a
nice
session
beer
when
sitting
in
the
canadian
rockies
it
has
a
great
tan
and
foamy
head
that
lasts
for
probably
34
of
the
way
down
and
laces
the
glass
nicely
thx
355
ml
can
probably
the
most
popular
big
rock
product
color
is
a
coppery
red
almost
no
head
leaves
a
patchy
cap
of
surface
foam
small
amount
of
lacing
first
smell
is
sweet
sugary
malt
with
slight
caramel
taste
is
sweet
and
grainy
light
bitter
to
finish
but
overall
well
balanced
and
no
after
taste
medium
body
and
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
expecting
a
traditional
ale
you
might
be
dissapointed
because
it
is
somewhat
characterless
has
no
overpowering
strong
points
just
good
all
around
poured
with
almost
no
head
at
all
but
retained
a
small
lace
through
the
whole
glass
brown
colour
not
very
pale
at
all
malt
and
nuts
on
the
nose
taste
is
nutty
with
mild
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
isnt
spectacular
but
i
like
the
taste
so
i
give
this
a
higher
drinkability
rating
as
i
find
it
a
very
good
session
beer
i
much
prefer
it
on
tap
as
i
have
had
many
times
on
visits
to
calgary
i
usually
start
to
crave
this
beer
in
the
autumn
when
i
want
something
a
little
darker
but
not
very
not
a
bad
offering
from
big
rock
very
clear
coppery
red
colour
offwhite
head
quickly
subsided
to
a
thin
lace
malty
aroma
with
some
caramel
and
light
nuttiness
the
flavour
was
a
bit
disappointing
with
some
grainy
sweetness
to
start
and
finishing
with
a
very
light
bitterness
its
almost
as
if
the
flavour
disappears
part
way
through
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
light
body
with
almost
no
aftertaste
acid
is
also
the
key
shes
giving
me
stomachaches
worthy
however
with
the
drinkability
of
a
sam
adams
lager
maybe
that
should
be
different
for
this
style
but
get
past
the
divergence
with
its
proclaimed
style
and
its
worth
drinking
pours
a
dull
dark
copper
color
with
a
crackly
head
that
fades
fast
soft
malts
and
some
floral
hops
make
up
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
malts
and
some
funny
yeast
taste
the
hops
are
not
very
noticeable
this
beer
was
a
dissapointment
to
me
its
seriously
lacking
in
the
hop
department
and
has
a
very
bland
run
of
the
mill
flavor
the
finish
is
clean
but
way
too
watery
this
beer
is
like
an
amateur
extract
hombrew
some
decent
malt
then
bit
of
hopbitterness
and
aftertaste
medium
texture
and
watery
rather
bland
not
much
hops
canadian
relying
on
balance
water
and
sugar
slight
fizz
and
yeast
midsip
the
type
to
have
cold
as
refreshing
as
you
are
not
missing
anything
its
drinkable
and
unthreatening
i
guess
thats
why
soooo
many
people
drink
trad
here
in
calgary
its
not
a
pale
ale
and
its
not
a
great
beer
but
its
not
bad
had
this
on
tap
in
many
calgary
and
edmonton
pubs
flows
like
water
here
as
br
has
sewed
up
the
draft
market
locally
tapped
a
crystal
clear
darker
amber
slight
white
cap
that
doesnt
last
long
slight
hints
of
citrusy
and
grassy
hop
boiled
grains
in
the
aroma
starts
light
and
rather
timid
for
a
traditional
english
dark
ale
ale
but
then
the
fuller
body
kicks
in
midway
with
the
well
balanced
hop
and
malt
departure
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
lingering
bread
after
taste
as
commercial
canuck
ales
go
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
lot
but
still
lacking
its
another
attempt
to
canadianize
a
traditional
ale
style
for
the
mass
market
it
is
always
a
compromise
but
as
compromises
go
this
one
has
retained
a
modicum
of
ale
character
to
make
it
king
of
the
commercial
canuk
ales
sorry
cant
recommend
this
one
a
nice
cloudless
amber
color
as
it
sets
in
the
glass
head
is
adequate
frothy
and
a
winsome
beige
color
as
is
disappears
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
is
left
behind
to
hide
the
glass
all
malt
nose
sweet
and
clean
a
satisfactory
sniffer
sweet
malt
start
once
again
a
bit
thin
on
top
for
me
but
nothing
i
cant
live
with
finish
is
sternly
acidic
the
hops
pleasant
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
and
a
fine
drinking
beer
especially
in
the
hot
summer
months
this
is
the
first
microbrew
i
ever
tasted
way
back
in
the
day
it
was
also
my
standard
as
a
teenager
and
in
my
early
college
days
i
was
a
beer
snob
even
back
then
better
than
anything
else
available
at
the
time
i
strayed
away
over
the
years
in
pursuit
of
new
brews
and
feel
i
have
come
full
circle
its
good
to
come
home
been
a
while
since
i
sampled
a
trad
now
i
can
fully
appreciete
it
pours
out
a
clear
reddishamber
tone
decent
heat
to
begin
with
but
it
fades
away
to
a
lacy
ring
in
time
nose
is
of
rich
malt
intense
hops
wood
smoke
a
hint
of
spice
and
an
even
fainter
hint
of
melon
taste
is
an
impressive
balance
of
malt
and
hops
one
receeding
behind
the
other
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
smooth
the
golden
standard
of
big
rock
it
lets
you
know
what
real
ale
should
taste
like
a
perfect
session
ale
it
leaves
one
satisfied
a
close
2nd
behind
their
mcnallys
extra
ale
for
top
quality
recomended
counterparts
cheers
a
good
standard
example
of
an
american
ale
worth
drinking
it
is
readily
available
in
alberta
both
in
bottles
and
ontap
i
have
heard
they
are
exporting
to
california
though
im
not
sure
which
styles
i
really
liked
this
one
not
as
much
as
gl
but
close
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
and
might
even
be
better
on
tap
worth
trying
at
any
point
would
buy
again
if
only
in
a
mixed
6
pack
because
i
like
to
try
a
variety
at
5
6
abv
this
is
one
of
the
lightest
weyerbacher
beers
its
good
beer
to
enjoy
because
of
that
easy
to
drink
nothing
superspecial
about
it
but
it
isnt
bad
the
flavor
profile
is
disappointing
there
is
some
light
caramel
and
a
roasted
malt
nuttiness
underneath
a
somewhat
metallic
off
flavor
the
finish
is
a
lingering
continuation
of
the
off
flavor
im
glad
this
6
pack
was
a
gift
because
the
rest
is
going
in
the
garbage
nothing
special
another
winter
ale
the
worst
winter
ale
ive
ever
had
cheap
bitter
taste
with
disagreeable
bitter
aftertaste
goods
overall
tasting
winter
beer
overall
this
is
another
solid
delicious
beer
from
weyerbacher
which
is
fastly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
east
coast
breweries
great
strong
notes
of
roasted
malt
and
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
accented
with
spice
and
beautifully
balanced
hops
malt
fans
will
love
this
beer
i
expected
a
winter
warmer
style
beer
not
an
english
brown
ale
not
gross
but
really
no
good
t
not
as
rich
as
the
aroma
implies
fairly
dark

dark
coffee
and
dark
fruit
are
most
prominent
light

pours
a
deep
clear
brown
with
a
thicker

head
the
head
quickly
settles
down
leaving
nice
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
with
some
generic
dark
and
caramel
malt
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
little
better
with
some
nice
nutty
notes
and
a
little
sweetness
but
not
much
else
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
there
is
too
much
carbonation
for
me
great
mouthfeelbeautiful
ruby
colorrich
slightly
malty
with
a

great
winter
beer
without
the
high

very
good
winter
ale
not
too
heavy
not
bitter
nice
and
rich
not
sweet
or

just
beer
would
be
nice
with
fish

chips

nachos

for
the

o
not
the
best
winter
warmer
also
ran
overall
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
brown
ale
until
i
poured
it
the
dark

took
me
by
surprise
i
like
brown
ales
it
has
very
good
overall
flavors
and
aromas
above
average
id
say
good
beer
id
buy
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
winter
ale
and
i
liked
the
dark
lustrous
nature
of
it
as
well
as
the
pleasing
but
not
overpowering
berry
flavors
it
settled
well
on
the
tongue
and
i
would
definitely
get
it
again

a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
not
overly
carbonated
and
not
something
i
could
see
chugging
more
of
a
sit
back
and
relaxer
o
its
rare
that
i
dump
a
beer
but
i
wrote
the
review
drinking
half
of
the
glass
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
i
usually
like
weyerbachers
beers
quite
a
bit
but
this
was
a
disappointment
overall
a
very
lackluster
beer
way
too
much
metal
and
watery
underwhelming
all
around
overall
this
accomplishes
what
it
set
out
to
accomplish
but
this
is
nothing
to
brag
about
overall
i
am
drinking
this
in
july
as
i
got
the
6er
for
a
1
99
what
the
heck
right
i
got
about
34
through
it
and
drain
poured
the
rest
will
give
the
rest
away
may
try
it
fresh
to
see
if
its
any
different
overall
the
w
brand
has
settled
slightly
with
its
alcohol
overload
mission
and
seems
to
have
attempted
a
more
restrained
approach
here
the
winter
may
need
more
distinguishable
notes
but
its
serviceable
at
house
parties
and
before
the
fireplace
meh
a
beer
to
drink
in
a
pinch
not
really
worth
a
revisit
in
the
future
either
just
very
average
and
too
much
sweetness
for
a
winter
ale
a
very
unoffensive
beer
the
best
attribute
is
its
color
a
nice
rich
brown
however
the
taste
is
very
average
no
discernable
flavors
jump
out
i
would
almost
call
it
an
amber
beer
the
smell
is
nonexistant
a
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
for
a
beer
enthusiast
o
meh
pretty
unremarkable
in
every
way
its
not
bad
its
easy
to
drink
but
it
comes
off
as
out
of
balance
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
really
worth
drinking
a
big
letdown
from
weyerbacher
whos
beers
are
generally
stellar
a
winter
ale
an
english
brown
a
beer
a
rather
lifeless
mostly
clear
colabrown
body
odorless
mostly
flavorless
some
chocolate
malt
a
bitter
dryness
in
the
finish
really
just
nothing
to
say
about
this
one
weyerbacher
tends
to
be
all
over
the
map
this
is
a
low
point
pours
a
redish
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
abit
of
retention
and
a
nice
lace
aroma
is
of
toasty
grainy
caramel
malts
and
brown
sugar
body
is
light
with
some
carbonation
taste
ia
toasty
with
hints
of
fruity
sugars
and
bready
malts
smooth
finish
not
badbut
far
from
outstanding
dark
cherrycolored
ale
with
a
sudsy
beige
head
about
one
finger
thick
aromas
of
brown
sugar
tart
fruit
and
bread
mild
fruit
and
caramel
flavor
the
taste
is
somewhat
bland
and
disappointing
given
the
decent
aroma
it
has
weyerbacher
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
offers
some
exceptional
styles
of
beer
unfortunately
this
isnt
one
of
them
a
fairly
decent
ale
a
bit
bland
in
the
flavor
but
otherwise
nothing
to
complain
about
easily
drinkable
but
potentially
unmemorable
would
have
it
again
in
the
future
depending
on
the
alternatives
it
is
not
terrible
just
a
disapointing
effort
from
weyerbacher
my
god
what
a
great
beer
if
you
love
english
brown
ale
with
some
chcolate
in
it
this
beer
for
you
smooth
tasty
wow
the
taste
jumps
out
in
the
beer
and
its
so
good
looks
great
in
glass
and
love
it
what
can
i
say
its
english
a
brown
ale
and
has
chcolate
dont
walk
to
the
store
run
to
it
great
beer
nice
winter
brown
ale
with
a
chocolatey
taste
i
poured
it
into
a
frosted
mug
and
saw
it
was
a
rich
dark
coppery
color
though
it
quickly
disappeared
smooth
finish
left
me
wanting
more
lower
abv
allows
that
unlike
its
cousin
the
merry
monk
by
weyerbacher
read
now
that
this
is
an
english
brown
which
explains
a
lot
o
not
a
flavor
explosion
but
very
surprisingnice
flavor
mixed
with
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
really
nice
to
drink
really
smooth
gone
in
5
minutes
after
letting
it
sit
for
1520
definitely
getting
more
of
this
much
better
than
i
remember
in
years
past
new
label
new
deliciousness
very
average
which
is
not
characteristic
of
this
brewery
avoidable
o
another
underwhelming
offering
from
weyerbacher
nothing
specifically
bad
other
than
their
typical
yeast
profile
which
i
dont
really
care
for
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
feels
almost
full
bodied
on
the
palette
and
is
quite
drinkable
drinks
like
it
should
have
a
higher
abv
this
is
a
pretty
simple
typical
english
brown
ale
the
nose
wasnt
impressing
but
the
flavor
hits
most
of
the
right
notes
anyone
who
likes
an
english
brown
ale
will
probably
enjoy
this
one
o
this
is
the
best
winterchristmas
brew
ive
had
so
far
this
year
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
i
only
got
one
bottle
but
now
im
wishing
id
gotten
more
o
weyerbachers
winter
ale
doesnt
do
much
to
suggest
winter
to
me
or
even
offer
a
nudge
towards
the
season
with
spice
or
alcohol
warmth
for
that
matter
its
certainly
not
an
awful
beer
but
the
roasted
malt
flavor
which
comes
out
of
nowhere
adds
a
poor
metallic
flavor
to
it
that
strikes
me
particularly
hard
an
average
brown
ale
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
close
to
no
head
just
a
think
layer
of
light
brownish
tan
across
the
surface
swiftly
gone
virtually
zero
lacing
as
well
the
liquid
is
murky
enough
to
achieve
opacity
otherwise
some
brightness
to
the
reddish
brown
color
some
lighter
orange
tones
further
out
only
the
merest
trace
of
bubbles
the
nose
emphasizes
soft
sweetness
in
the
form
of
caramel
molasses
brown
sugar
roasted
nuts
and
soda
bread
some
carob
and
cinnamon
like
spices
too
no
real
fruit
or
citrus
presence
you
get
more
oats
and
general
grains
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
its
fullbodied
somewhat
bottom
heavy
paucity
of
carbonation
does
not
help
this
situation
just
sort
of
lays
there
until
it
suddenly
loses
weight
through
the
finish
ends
short
more
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
here
hints
at
a
sort
of
burnt
quality
there
are
softening
vanilla
hazelnut
caramel
toffee
nutmeg
creamed
coffee
and
some
cola
bean
notes
as
well
as
that
soft
baked
dessert
goods
quality
given
the
general
sweetness
of
the
flavors
curious
how
texturally
dry
it
is
nothing
which
meaningfully
bespeaks
the
presence
of
hops
flavorful
cant
say
theres
anything
wrong
with
it
per
se
but
you
forget
youre
even
holding
a
half
full
glass
not
a
good
sign
cheers
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
with
very
tiny
bubbles
has
very
little
smell
mostly
a
little
sweet
with
some
spice
what
spice
i
have
no
idea
taste
is
fairly
bland
medium
body
and
decent
to
low
carbonation
there
are
better
xmas
ales
out
there
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
not
something
id
pick
up
again
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
very
mild
bland
not
something
i
expected
from
weyerbacher
honestly
but
i
guess
they
cant
all
be
perfect
again
its
not
terrible
and
i
guess
it
was
worth
the
experience
of
tasting
it
to
learn
it
wasnt
great
if
that
makes
sense
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
winter
warmer
and
all
i
got
was
a
watered
down
bland
brown
ale
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
my
pour
was
initially
creating
so
much
head
that
there
was
a
cascading
action
at
the
junction
between
where
the
head
ended
and
the
beer
began
that
i
backed
off
it
eventually
settled
into
a
little
over
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
garnetbrown
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
spicy
like
cinnamon
andor
cloves
had
been
used
along
with
a
lightly
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
and
the
taste
was
like
spiced
cocoa
chocolate
with
cinnamon
interesting
finish
was
semidry
and
nicely
refreshing
not
bad
very
dark
brown
with
a
light
sand
colored
single
finger
froth
head
medium
retention
and
lacing
smells
lightly
of
blended
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
mostly
and
a
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
just
about
exactly
as
predicted
from
the
nose
but
also
has
an
aspirinlike
bitterness
on
the
finish
lighter
side
of
medium
body
and
carbonation
levels
overall
it
could
have
used
some
amplification
and
slightly
more
sweetness
for
my
palate
very
like
able
overall
d
easy
drinking
lightly
spiced
malty
winter
warmer
with
an
easily
manageable
abv
o
a
nice
tasty
winter
warmer
that
serves
its
purpose
well
great
if
you
like
malty
beers
or
winter
brews
in
general
o
decent
winter
ale
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
pretty
darn
good
and
very
enjoyable
poured
this
beer
from
a
bottle
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
half
inch
head
which
dissipated
fairly
quickly
very
nice
copperybrown
color
a
bit
of
caramelnut
aroma
no
overtly
strong
spice
flavors
typically
found
in
a
winter
ale
nice
clean
dry
finish
i
personally
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
nicest
brown
ales
ive
had
though
it
is
not
specifically
a
brown
ale
very
enjoyable
oan
ok
winter
beer
most
likely
will
never
buy
it
again
but
id
gladly
drink
it
again
if
offered
o
really
delicious
reminds
me
of
a
fest
beer
mixed
with
a
residual
sweetness
the
flavors
work
ok
but
im
not
100
on
board
with
its
vibe
a
decent
beer
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
next
time
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
tiny
head
that
retains
well
aroma
is
a
nice
deep
caramel
maltiness
with
a
bit
of
spicing
and
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
very
nice
it
is
a
well
balanced
winter
warmer
with
a
strong
warming
caramel
maltiness
taking
center
stage
the
spices
play
a
supporting
role
instead
of
overwhelming
harpoon
im
talking
to
you
theres
some
herbal
hops
finishing
this
guy
up
too
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
a
solid
winter
warmer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
wont
do
you
wrong
this
is
nice
i
would
grab
a
sixpack
of
this
to
bring
to
someones
house
the
beer
poured
with
a
pitch
black
appearance
with
a
bubblerich
head
that
faded
quickly
the
aroma
had
a
dull
sweet
smell
with
general
flavors
that
are
fruit
with
a
slight
roast
of
nuts
to
it
the
taste
was
bittersweet
and
had
more
of
a
roasty
nut
flavor
than
i
could
sense
with
my
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
nicely
carbonated
but
nice
and
light
making
it
relatively
refreshing
compared
to
its
somewhat
heavy
roast
taste
overall
a
relatively
enjoyable
winter
drink
overall
nothing
special
here
its
worth
a
try
but
not
a
beer
i
would
pine
for
o
this
is
an
okay
winter
warmer
certainly
worth
a
try
from
a
great
brewery
o
theres
not
much
to
this
beer
but
thats
why
its
great
a
very
straightforward
and
sessionable
winter
warmer
i
will
try
this
again
just
to
see
if
i
had
a
bad
batch
or
if
this
beer
really
is
this
bad
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
disappointing
not
much
going
on
at
all
and
there
are
much
better
winter
options
available
overall
this
tastes
like
a
watered
down
winter
warmer
would
have
liked
more
flavor
but
what
is
there
isnt
bad
ugh
too
sweet
odd
characteristics
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
flavor
but
it
just
gets
lost
by
everything
else
i
cant
figure
out
what
this
is
just
weird
and
not
very
good
for
a
brewery
i
tend
to
really
like
i
dont
understand
the
b
rating
this
beer
has
highly
drinkable
with
good
flavor
would
make
for
an
awesome
winter
session
beer
o
not
the
winter
warmer
i
would
look
for
or
buy
certainly
drinkable
but
an
average
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
not
enough
flavor
or
body
to
make
it
interesting
medium
bodied
with
a
balance
of
roasted
malt
peppery
spice
and
dark
fruit
theres
a
slight
syrupy
medicinal
presence
along
with
some
dark
cherry
and
plum
the
spice
adds
a
slight
dryness
that
balances
the
sweetness
and
compliments
the
subtle
roasted
chocolate
malt
character
decent
but
kind
of
pedestrian
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
spices
taste
is
also
somewhat
malty
some
spice
and
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
a
very
interesting
beer
well
done
i
think
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
many
times
before
the
winter
goes
away
o
its
not
bad
but
it
seems
underpowered
and
not
plain
but
average
drinkable
but
not
compelling
i
tend
to
forget
about
the
beer
while
im
doing
things
even
typing
this
review
not
recommended
dark
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
light
carmel
malts
taste
is
the
same
carmel
maltsbread
and
toffee
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
doesnt
wow
but
gets
the
job
done
i
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
and
id
probably
purchase
again
we
did
a
large
christmas
and
winter
beer
tasting
panel
and
this
was
one
of
the
many
that
we
tried
most
of
the
beers
we
tried
we
solid
including
this
one
that
the
panel
liked
the
body
is
medium
and
theres
a
good
creaminess
to
it
building
off
a
nice
crispness
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
sharp
o
i
liked
this
better
than
the
dundee
descent
winter
warmer
poured
dark
brown
with
less
than
a
finger
of
head
and
no
retention
there
is
an
unpleasant
astringent
smell
to
this
offering
dark
roasted
malt
is
present
in
this
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
winter
warmer
there
is
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
may
be
the
highlight
of
the
experience
for
this
one
kind
of
boring
little
flavor
little
body
little
aroma
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
o
a
pretty
good
winter
ale
not
the
best
ive
had
this
year
but
still
worth
a
try
overall
would
possibly
drink
this
one
again
but
perhaps
even
more
surprised
at
how
well
this
goes
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
a
long
days
work
after
having
this
now
i
couldnt
imagine
it
being
better
in
the
winter
the
body
was
very
light
and
made
it
for
an
easy
drinking
it
might
have
ery
well
been
past
its
prime
but
hell
it
still
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
pours
dark
brown
with
chestnut
and
mahogany
highlights
throughout
two
plus
fingers
of
khaki
head
falls
to
a
nice
layer
with
mild
lace
nose
has
dried
dark
fruits
light
raisin
and
plum
some
light
brown
sugar
taste
has
the
same
dark
fruits
but
with
a
lower
intensity
than
the
nose
suggested
dry
grapes
and
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
medium
feel
but
almost
a
flat
dry
and
dead
palate
lacks
any
real
complexity
moderate
drinkability
but
not
enticing
enough
to
warrant
another
go
underwhelming
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
that
has
a
pretty
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
spicy
with
seasonal
herbs
in
the
mix
with
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
pretty
good
there
is
a
sweet
malt
start
to
it
that
finishes
off
with
the
spices
kicking
in
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thicker
side
not
oily
but
kind
of
heavy
which
makes
this
a
pretty
nice
winter
brew
weyerbacher
winter
ale
is
a
dim
cloudy
redbrown
beer
with
a
dirty
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
faint
malty
aroma
thats
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
soy
sauce
its
pretty
full
bodied
and
syrupy
a
chewy
finish
leaves
the
mouth
slick
it
has
a
mellow
well
balanced
flavor
with
notes
of
coke
syrup
and
herbs
its
just
a
touch
sweet
there
are
hints
of
fruitcake
and
oregano
its
pretty
substantive
warming
and
very
smooth
overall
3
not
too
bad
for
free
much
more
like
a
brown
ale
or
dark
lager
even
than
a
winter
warmer
no
spicing
just
malty
goodness
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
it
paired
well
with
barbq
sauce
pretty
good
english
strong
ale
better
than
i
expected
to
be
honest
nothing
special
and
just
a
decent
winter
ale
would
like
to
see
more
spices
in
this
rather
then
toastedness
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
in
the
taste
department
its
too
thin
and
has
a
watery
feel
not
a
fan
of
this
one
although
weyerbacher
makes
many
amazing
beers
this
isnt
one
of
them
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
two
to
three
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
and
a
skim
head
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
nuttiness
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
toastiness
and
nuttiness
with
a
caramel
malt
backbone
no
hop
presence
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
slightly
thin
the
drinkability
is
okay
it
is
for
sure
an
easy
drink
but
the
complexity
and
taste
leave
you
wanting
something
that
it
doesnt
provide
i
like
this
as
a
winter
brew
more
malt
less
spice
its
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
i
only
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
bottle
next
year
a
six
pack
at
least
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
caramelized
malt
with
very
light
toffee
notes
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
of
caramelized
malt
with
light
warming
notes
of
toffee
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
brewed
with
great
drinkability
factor
i
dont
know
if
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
because
i
spend
a
couple
hours
at
the
ring
before
but
it
is
quite
tasty
the
overall
mouthfeel
goes
well
with
the
rest
the
carbonation
mixes
well
with
the
spices
and
allows
them
to
linger
to
linger
on
the
tongue
as
it
goes
down
i
would
and
have
drink
a
few
of
these
hence
why
i
bought
the
case
while
it
is
not
the
best
of
the
style
it
is
still
a
great
buy
for
the
price
i
got
it
for
very
enjoyable
d
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
stands
out
to
make
me
want
to
try
it
again
the
labels
cartoonish
snowmen
are
cute
but
while
weyerbacher
winter
ale
tries
to
be
a
hearty
warming
spicy
winter
ale
it
has
a
little
growing
up
to
do
before
it
can
really
be
taken
seriously
although
a
more
than
acceptable
quaff
and
an
overall
endearing
beer
its
simply
not
one
bold
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
cold
canadian
winter
next
time
ill
pass
dont
be
shy
weyerbacher
do
a
photoshop
trick
and
saturate
the
colors
in
this
some
i
promise
youll
get
me
to
try
this
again
maybe
even
buy
a
sixer
d
a
very
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
this
is
a
murky
hazy
dark
brown
color
small
head
tan
in
color
the
smell
is
very
malty
toasted
and
brown
malts
somewhat
chocolaty
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
up
front
finishes
a
little
drier
the
beer
is
full
in
body
with
a
medium
carbonation
roasty
nutty
and
engaging
the
beer
though
doesnt
really
have
a
wow
factor
d
high
i
could
have
another
one
of
these
good
offering
from
weyerbacher
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
creamy
with
a
nice
lower
alchohol
so
you
can
enjoy
more
d
hard
to
identify
a
distinguishing
characteristic
that
inspires
repeated
drinking
quality
ingredients
seem
present
but
lacking
cohesion
would
drink
this
if
it
was
all
that
was
available
but
wouldnt
look
for
it
this
recipe
is
off
and
atypical
of
its
named
style
db
pretty
much
the
sort
of
flavor
you
would
expect
in
the
style
but
with
a
weak
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
compliment
the
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
decent
example
of
the
style
like
i
said
this
beer
wont
wow
you
but
its
a
nice
one
to
enjoy
in
the
cold
weather
bakers
chocolate
and
coffe
tones
make
the
flavor
decent
enough
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
and
finishes
clean
thin
and
uncarbonated
in
mouthfeel
which
is
a
plus
here
understated
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
this
one
will
get
you
through
the
night
d
decent
tasting
and
highly
drinkable
offering
from
weyerbacher
the
winter
alewarmer
style
isnt
exactly
the
most
appealing
to
me
and
this
one
may
not
be
the
best
of
the
style
but
its
still
an
ok
beer
gets
a
4
because
you
can
deffinitely
session
this
but
better
taste
wouldve
brought
this
up
a
lot
d
this
ale
is
one
that
i
will
drink
again
d
this
is
a
very
onedimensional
brown
ale
not
what
i
would
consider
a
holiday
beer
but
rather
the
appropos
named
cool
weather
brown
ale
this
however
would
not
be
my
first
choice
this
is
an
interesting
beer
with
good
flavor
and
creaminess
making
for
high
drinkability
lacks
the
body
or
high
abv
found
in
more
traditional
winter
ales
not
the
best
warmer
out
there
but
this
was
an
interesting
beer
from
weeyerbacher
and
i
enjoyed
picking
out
some
ofthe
more
unique
flavors
here
d
well
i
will
have
to
get
a
sixer
if
this
is
still
around
after
the
holidays
but
a
really
solid
winter
warmer
which
seems
to
not
have
any
spice
only
slightly
less
better
than
east
end
snow
melt
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
though
its
not
the
best
winter
warmer
im
glad
i
grabbed
a
sixer
to
enjoy
over
the
holidays
with
friends
family
seems
to
be
a
hit
with
the
noncraft
crowd
no
winter
spice
that
sometimes
dominates
or
destroys
winter
warmers
depending
on
your
opinion
i
for
one
like
em
not
heavily
spiced
feels
more
like
a
big
brownporter
than
a
winter
warmer
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
a
decent
winter
ale
but
coming
from
weyerbacher
i
expect
more
id
like
to
see
them
retire
this
beer
and
come
out
with
something
a
little
more
complex
and
assertive
for
the
holiday
season
d
goes
down
easy
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
around
the
house
in
winter
for
people
who
arent
die
hard
craft
beer
enthusiasts
drinkable
yes
but
not
for
me
d
nice
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
winter
warmers
as
a
atyle
but
this
is
a
really
drinkable
one
its
very
subtle
and
not
overly
spiced
which
is
what
i
like
about
it
good
work
again
weyerbacher
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
memorable
if
youre
looking
for
a
winter
warmer
great
lakes
christmas
ale
or
sierra
nevada
celebration
are
much
better
not
bad
but
not
stellar
im
a
little
bit
disappointed
as
i
find
that
most
weyerbacher
offerings
are
pretty
damn
good
if
youre
looking
for
an
interesting
winter
warmer
or
christmas
ale
look
elsewherethis
ones
not
that
impressive
weyerbacher
winter
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
at

its
very
drinkable
but
im
not
sure
its
a
beer
id
grab
again
with
all
the
great
winter
beers
on
the
market
weyerbacher
is
just
a
middle
of
the
road
winter
warmer
while
easy
to
drink
i
would
rank
this
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
quality
beverages
that
this
category
consists
of
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
body
is
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
1
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
a
little
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
pepper
and
has
a
little
of
a
bitter
finish
to
it
this
one
has
a
decent
mouth
feel
and
is
drinkable
i
really
wasnt
expecting
what
i
got
from
this
but
it
was
really
good
the
flavor
is
simple
yet
refreshing
no
way
i
would
call
this
a
winter
warmer

easy
to

due
to
its
light
feel
no
much
flavor
though
while
i
enjoy
the
bigger
winter
beers
i
also
can
appreciate
a
well
made
tasty
medium
weight
effort
like
this
years
schells
snowstorm
this
one
though
is
just
simple
unremarkable
i
like
a
lot
of
weyerbachers
stuff
and
was
looking
forward
to
this
but
came
away
very
disappointed
d
fine
one
is
enough
have
enjoyed
some
of
the
other
beers
from
weyerbacher
more
so
than
this
one
and
certainly
better
winter
warmers
out
there
drinks
ok
solid
offering
for
small
session
nothing
overpowering
or
mindblowing
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
highlights
there
is
about
a
twi
finger
tan
bubbly
head
head
dissapates
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
trace
of
lacing
on
the
glass
throughout
nose
has
some
hints
of
light
roasted
coffee
and
cocoa
aromas
but
most
overwhelming
is
the
bitter
scent
to
it
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
flavorwith
mild
coffee
the
beer
itseld
is
slightly
dry
and
is
rather
light
bodied
for
a
winter
ale
i
was
rather
disappointed
with
this
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
pick
up
agian
this
isnt
quite
what
i
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
but
had
some
nice
character
but
overall
would
probably
opt
for
something
else
if
nothing
else
it
would
be
a
nice
easy
drinker
that
i
would
reccomend
to
others
getting
in
to
the
style
that
dont
want
an
overwhelming
around
of
spice
i
would
also
like
to
try
this
again
a
little
warmer
to
see
it
the
flavors
would
pop
a
little
more
d
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
it
tastes
great
and
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
well
the
aroma
almost
put
me
off
because
i
thought
who
wheres
this
abv
taking
me
but
the
flavor
mitigated
that
concern
though
it
still
carries
a
bit
more
oomph
than
one
might
expect
that
said
the
overall
profile
lends
to
a
nice
drinking
warming
brew
that
fits
well
on
a
cold
night
maybe
not
a
first
choice
but
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
six
either
a
very
nice
beer
from
weyerbacher
i
suspect
having
it
on
cask
greatly
improves
it
could
hinder
some
a
good
beer
that
may
not
excitebut
hits
the
spot
a
pretty
drinkable
winter
warmer
dark
roasty
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
recommended

ontap
a
good
classic

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
this
pours
out
a
dark
clear
cocacola
brown
with
a
light
tan
finebubbled
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
is
appetizing
and
has
a
strong
overtone
of
cloves
and
cinnamon
flavor
is
pleasant
malty
with
hints
of
sweetness
and
spice
and
just
a
hint
of
molasses
texture
is
smooth
so
it
goes
down
the
hatch
easily
pours
to
a
dark
winter
brown
with
a
medium
thick
offwhite
head
that
lingers
well
and
leaves
okay
lacing
mild
coffeecaramel
nose
with
a
tingly
mouth
and
a
flavor
that
resembles
the
nose
this
is
capped
off
by
a
finish
that
is
of
reasonable
duration
slightly
dry
and
somewhat
bittersweet
not
a
great
winter
warmer
but
not
bad
either
i
would
most
likely
not
get
this
beer
again
color
is
purple
sort
of
a
rosy
brown
not
all
that
attractive
taste
is
sort
of
like
a
confused
homebrew
basically
tastes
like
a
watered
down
version
of
magic
hats
odd
notion
you
definitely
notice
the
separation
of
the
beers
flavor
with
the
underlying
mouthfeel
i
always
think
that
when
you
can
notice
the
flavor
as
being
distinct
from
the
mouthfeel
something
is
definitely
wrong
this
is
sort
of
a
confused
beer
it
was
the
first
i
had
from
weyerbacher
so
i
was
a
tad
disappointed
d
a
nice
creamy
beer
but
i
couldnt
put
down
a
sixer
of
this
in
a
weekend
i
would
feel
full
after
two
d
very
drinkable
the
lighter
body
makes
this
really
easy
to
put
down
and
not
on
the
counter
drinkability
i
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
more
mmph
here
but
i
still
dug
it
ultimately
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
enjoy
with
an
overall
pleasing
sweet
maltiness
d
easy
to
drink
and
cleantasting
overall
a
solid
winter
warmer
but
not
anything
spectacular
vaguely
representative
of
style
in
my
experience
though
perhaps
more
in
common
with
a
brown
ale
worth
a
try
easy
to
drink
winter
warmer
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
very
little
lacing
smell
is
a
vague
coco
other
flavors
are
not
pronounced
at
all
i
usually
appreciate
the
beers
that
weyerbacher
makes
even
with
the
very
high
alcohol
associated
with
most
of
there
products
this
one
just
seems
like
a
failed
attempt
at
what
could
have
been
a
good
beer
tastes
watered
down
dont
know
what
they
were
thinking
with
this
one
dark
brown
color
very
light
carbonation
smell
doesnt
really
exist
i
guess
if
i
were
to
nit
pick
i
could
smell
a
hint
of
chocolatemalts
tastes
like
a
watery
shitty
guiness
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
is
easy
to
drink
however
if
you
like
watery
shitty
guiness
drinkability
is
good
perhaps
due
to
the
light
body
and
the
understated
spicing
i
believe
this
beer
would
go
well
with
a
number
of
dishes
from
traditional
thanksgivig
fare
to
barbecue
pours
a
clear
fairly
dark
brown
light
tan
head
maltt
nutty
nose
flavor
is
a
bit
bitter
with
a
sweet
tang
that
im
not
too
fond
of
really
it
isnt
all
that
bad
really
decent
enough
earthy
leafy
tones
feel
has
a
slight
bite
on
the
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
fairly
thick
overall
not
bad
middle
of
the
road
really
pours
a
dark
garnet
color
with
a
fairly
nice
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
ring
and
swirly
cap
smells
slightly
spicy
a
bit
malty
and
with
a
whiff
of
grain
sourness
the
taste
loses
the
grainy
sourness
picks
up
some
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
licorice
and
some
bitterness
up
front
to
balance
the
light
sweetness
fairly
decent
body
and
i
find
this
pretty
drinkable
if
nothing
remarkable
still
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
pours
a
cleanclear
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
offwhite
head
not
much
sticky
lacing
on
this
one
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
spiced
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
slightly
spicy
medium
body
drinkable
not
too
much
going
on
with
this
brew
but
still
is
tasty
d
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
i
let
this
one
sit
for
a
while
as
im
trying
it
in
september
and
i
think
it
did
it
good
d
having
a
winter
ale
on
the
4th
of
july
at
a
bbq
some
things
are
meant
to
go
together
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
and
would
have
again
session
away
overall
the
label
was
more
interesting
than
the
beer
itself
it
would
have
been
average
if
the
aroma
wasnt
so
odd
once
the
winter
season
rolls
around
back
again
next
year
i
fully
doubt
ill
be
looking
for
this
winter
warmer
this
one
is
a
root
beer
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
modest
lacing
i
can
pick
up
a
maltlicorice
aroma
with
a
little
coffee
the
flavor
brings
out
malt
and
coffee
and
some
nutty
highlights
its
somewhat
aqueous
for
the
style
sprite
carbonation
i
think
its
very
drinkable
i
note
a
little
peppery
flavor
with
some
grassy
wheat
and
a
charcoal
finish
its
interesting
but
not
so
bold
as
i
expected
good
enough
but
not
great
d
very
drinkable
this
ale
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
you
wont
be
disappointed
this
beer
is
okay
i
probably
will
look
elswhere
for
my
warmers
next
year
i
could
easily
polish
off
a
few
of
these
but
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
beer
i
would
grab
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
typical
winter
seasonal
drinkability
is
ok
i
could
have
one
more
if
i
had
a
hot
tub
in
the
winter
not
a
bad
beer
very
well
drinkable
but
not
that
great
for
a
winter
warmer
tasting
this
soon
after
reviewing
the
house
ale
im
finding
it
difficult
to
find
a
drastic
difference
between
the
two
this
might
fit
well
within
the
amber
ale
guidelines
better
than
within
a
winter
warmer
i
once
heard
someone
say
that
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
complex
just
good
this
definitely
isnt
the
former
but
im
not
quite
sure
if
its
the
latter
i
guess
it
serves
me
right
for
drinking
a
winter
warmer
when
the
temperatures
in
philly
in
midfebruary
were
in
the
60s
there
are
a
ton
of
really
good
winter
warmers
this
beer
isnt
one
of
them
its
a
perfectly
drinkable
average
beer
which
is
sometimes
all
you
ever
want
in
a
beer
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
overall
so
so
at
best
this
is
a
solid
malty
beer
nothing
that
turns
me
off
about
it
easy
enough
to
drink
a
decent
beer
a
quality
very
drinkable
beer
taste
is
pretty
roasted
and
sweet
malt
front
with
a
strong
enough
bitterness
one
of
the
more
drinkable
offerings
from
weyerbacher
as
most
of
their
beers
tend
to
be
quite
high
in
alcohol
content
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
on
a
cold
winters
day
the
spice
is
perfectly
done
and
that
is
much
appreciated
good
body
and
nice
slick
mouthfeel
im
all
over
this
one
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
better
it
gets
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
reddishbrown
with
a
half
of
a
finger
offwhite
head
that
quickly
subsided
into
a
thin
consistent
layer
of
foam
some
lacing
but
not
much
scent
was
malty
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
fruit
not
sure
what
taste
presented
as
a
bit
nutty
with
a
slight
hops
presence
that
gives
the
brew
a
little
bite
at
the
end
fairly
effervescent
in
the
mouth
leaving
a
surprisingly
clean
finish
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
very
reminiscent
of
a
brown
session
ale
in
many
ways
the
beer
shows
off
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
almost
guinness
like
head
smells
of
weyerbacher
there
is
some
roasted
malt
sweetness
in
the
nose
but
little
else
up
front
the
carbonation
is
full
and
noticeable
starts
off
sweet
and
midway
through
moves
to
a
slight
fruity
hop
taste
finishes
with
a
roasted
acidic
quality
and
semi
dry
notes
of
molasses
and
spices
throughout
comes
off
as
a
poterlite
i
cant
say
i
look
forward
to
this
each
winter
but
it
doesnt
turn
me
off
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
this
comes
off
a
little
over
carbonated
for
my
taste
in
short
i
find
the
beer
to
be
okay
and
simple
poured
into
an
imperial

smell
had
hints

orange

sugar
sweetness
along
with
some
nutmeg
and
wheat
taste
was
very
bland
with
only
slight
wheat
flavors
that
were
noticeable
after
the
sip
and
also
some
bitterness
felt
like
it
would
coat
the
mouth
well
until
actually
swallowed
then
it
felt
very
watery
easy
to
drink
the
wateriness
made
it

d
a

taste

between

and
a

flavor
the

is
very
easy

and
overall
and
very
good
beer
this
beer
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
smallish
head
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
reminiscent
of
chocolate
and
a
small
amount
of
spiciness
the
spice
which
i
took
as
mainly
clove
came
through
more
in
the
taste
i
also
thought
it
was
more
on
the
sweet
side
kind
of
an
average
beer
it
is
what
it
is
another
solid
interpretation
of
a
winter
warmerolde
style
ale
there
isnt
really
anything
that
makes
this
stand
out
and
the
carbonation
takes
a
little
away
from
what
this
beer
could
be
i
still
recommend
almost
anything
weyerbacher
but
some
of
their
other
offerings
are
definitely
standouts
while
this
one
kind
of
fades
into
the
holiday
background
brought
to
the
table
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
reddish
body
and
a
nice
thick
head
that
sat
on
top
of
the
glass
for
a
good
period
of
time
smell
was
of
caramel
malt
and
some
spices
but
it
really
did
not
resemble
a
winter
warmer
taste
was
muted
as
well
with
some
spice
coming
through
i
found
it
to
be
overly
carbonated
as
well
there
are
far
too
many
other
winter
beers
out
there
that
this
one
pales
in
comparison
to
hope
for
a
better
faring
next
year
decent
brown
pour
into
a
pint
glass
little
head
to
speak
of
some

in
the
smell
some
malted
milk
taste
is
borderline
metalic
with
the
chocolate
maybe
some
anise
not
too
tasty
mouthfeel
is
another
downfall
seems
thin
and
watery
to
me
drinkablity
is
ok
if
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
not
considered
sorry
to
say
i
didnt
even
finish
this
one
life
is
too
short
to
drink
mediocre
beer
next
could
it
be
that
ive
found
a
winter
beer
that
i
dont
like
final
note
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
ales
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
brew
before
spring
overall
i
think
its
worth
a
try
along
with
your
other
winter
ales
pours
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
one

ok
dont
think
ill
buy
this
one
again
md
maybe
a
tad
high
on
carbonation
body
is
medium
but
a
little
on
the
thin
side
drinkability
is
fine
not
quite
what
i
would
think
of
as
winter
warmer
but
something
that
is
easily
downed
its
kind
of
like
a
sweet
porter
with
some
other
weird
stuff
going
on
the
smell
is
pretty
offputting
bummer
this
is
better
than
the
spanish
peaks
one
in
that
at
least
it
has
some
body
to
it
the
flavor
is
a
bit
weird
but
you
could
always
just
call
that
seasonal
yeah
well
ok
for
now
well
im
not
convinced
that
this
is
a
true
winter
warmer
dominated
by
cinnamon
a
small
bitter
but
i
think
weyerbachers
house
yeast
is
holding
them
back

there

from
the
12

in

this

a

a
thick

o
roasted

light

and
a
dash
of

on

back
that
makes
this
a
rather
easily
quaffable
brew
moderate
carbonation
and
a
solid
improvement
with
warmth
not
overly
sweet
this
is
a
solid
example
and
an
excellent
brew
to
pair
with
a
spicy
meal
very
nice
pours
a
semiclear
brown
color
with
average
head
and
extra
nice
lacing
aroma
is
very
light
and
hard
to
pick
up
any
concise
elements
taste
is
light
with
malt
light
almond
and
a
considerable
amount
of
sweetness
overall
a
light
brown
ale
with
not
a
lot
of
bold
flavors
or
components
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
i
prefer
browns
less
sweet
than
this
one
by
bluegrass
it
was
difficult
to
detect
nuttiness
apart
from
slightly
resembling
a
marzens
character
and
although
carbonation
held
i
couldnt
keep
from
wondering
what
it
would
be
like
to
find
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
not
at
the
front
like
the
mm
standby
melt
in
your
mouth
not
in
your
hand
i
wanted
the
sweetness
to
find
me
not
smack
me
at
the
onset
practically
before
id
raised
my
handheld
beverage
to
sip
this
is
just
a
nice
brown
ale
color
is
a
murky
brown
with
decent
enough
head
retention
both
the
smell
and
taste
are
what
youd
expect
very
mild
with
caramel
malt
dominating
very
low
bitterness
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
very
sweet
finish
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
brown
ale
this
one
is
worth
a
try
o
allowed
to
warm
before
serving
but
not
enough
it
continued
to
improve
with
further
warming
3
25
d
not
the
best
but
its
tasty
enough
to
recommend
giving
it
a
try
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
nut
brown
has
some
nice
character
to
it
with
a
bit
of
a
vanilla
tone
that
i
find
unique
the
drawback
is
that
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
from
my
point
of
view
still
pretty
nice
though
frankly
if
only
a
few
more
things
were
tweaked
on
this
beer
itd
be
smokin
for
now
though
it
will
remain
decent
o
an
easy
drinking
ale
with
a
complexity
i
didnt
expect
very
smooth
and
very
flavorful
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
o
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
after
drinking
so
many
ba
imperial
stouts
and
dipas
its
hard
to
drink
thin
watery
stuff
like
this
but
it
has
its
place
and
i
think
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
tasty
session
beer
not
outstanding
but
solid
pours
a
medium
bright
brown
color
there
isnt
much
head
and
it
is
a
bright
white
this
beer
smells
a
little
sweet
and
almost
fruity
not
a
lot
on
the
nose
it
tastes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
bit
of
a
maltynutty
aftertaste
light
bodied
drinkable
just
not
much
flavor
i
guess
i
am
getting
used
to
the
american
style
brown
ales
overall
i
believe
this
average
at
best
this
would
be
a
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
is
just
starting
to
get
into
microbrews
because
of
the
lack
of
complexity
and
the
fact
that
its
rather
light
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brown
ale
and
one
that
i
would
seek
out
tasty
and
drinkable
d
a
little
up
and
down
and
all
around
this
brew
smells
great
but
i
thought
the
taste
couldnt
match
the
expectations
set
overall
a
quaffable
brown
but
not
exceptional
hazelnut
color
and
a
light
offwhite
head
that
capped
the
top
with
vigorous
carbonation
throughout
aroma
is
sweet
lots
of
caramel
and
roasted
nuts
hints
of
bready
grains
touches
of
light
earthy
hops
really
quite
nicely
done
i
have
to
admit
moving
forward
there
is
a
clean
crisp
feel
to
it
smooth
medium
body
is
well
deserving
and
shows
off
the
overall
profile
very
very
well
i
was
quite
impressed
with
how
easy
this
was
flavor
is
dominated
by
caramel
and
roasted
nuts
overall
a
very
satisfying
nut
brown
ale
very
solid
flavors
and
an
eastmy
drinker
to
boot
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
will
leave
you
wanting
more
after
each
sip
i
was
concerned
this
beer
might
be
a
bit
too
old
at
right
around
6
months
since
bottling
but
it
tasted
just
fine
it
seemed
to
open
up
with
more
flavors
as
it
warmed
overall
a
solid
brown
o
i
dont
think
i
would
get
this
one
again
but
it
was
style
worth
my
sobriety
just
this
once
despite
the
crazy
head
to
begin
with
the
beer
doesnt
feel
overly
carbonated
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
am
sorta
glad
that
i
gave
two
of
them
away
full
bodied
malty
ale
good
beer
but
nothing
overly
amazing
o
a
good
brown
ale
thars
worth
the
price
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
o
i
like
this
beer
very
easy
drinking
and
the
caramel
and
nut
flavor
was
really
good
the
hints
of
chocolate
was
a
nice
addition
drinkability
very
easy
beer
to
drink
due
to
its
smoothness
and
decent
flavor
it
could
use
a
little
more
depth
but
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
but
there
was
nothing
terribly
offputting
not
worth
seeking
out
but
not
worth
avoiding
either
drinkability
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
this
brown
ale
sufficed
for
tonight
id
be
interested
to
try
it
fresh
d
the
beer
is
good
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
nutty
molasses
tasting
beers
i
myself
find
it
far
too
heavy
on
the
malts
and
light
on
the
hops
to
drink
more
than
one
it
just
coats
my
mouth
and
tastes
sickly
sweet
after
just
a
couple
of
sips
there
is
some
that
this
beer
does
well
but
the
nutty
taste
is
just
off
and
that
really
hurts
the
enjoyability
of
it
i
stopped
trying
to
finish
my
6
pack
a
nice
complex
but
drinkable
craft
beer
worth
seeking
out
for
those
in
the
area
very
nice
interpretation
of
a
traditional
english
style
overall
very
pleasant
and
surprising
experience
i
expected
a
stereotypical
american
brown
beer
but
was
treated
with
a
complex
yet
drinkable
craft
beer
this
beer
would
be
ideal
while
watching
an
old
english
show
monty
python
red
dwarf
and
dr
who
come
to
mind
or
perhaps
during
a
board
game
involving
lots
of
pondering
and
backstabbing
drinkability
enjoyable
but
overall
a
little
too
sweet
the
sugarcandy
like
sweetness
was
excessive
and
not
counterbalanced
by
enough
of
a
malt
backbone
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
little
brown
ale
not
the
best
but
definitely
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
solid
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
it
seems
that
every
bluegrass
brewing
co
beer
i
have
had
lacks
a
bit
with
the
head
and
head
retention
however
malted
milk
chocolate
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
when
i
smell
this
beer
and
maybe
some
nut
like
hazelnut
actually
it
smells
a
lot
like
nutella
weird
medium
mouthfeel
roasted
malt
taste
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
no
realy
hop
bitterness
to
speak
of
subtle
sweetness
and
pretty
smooth
very
light
taste
of
light
roast
coffee
as
well
d
i
pickedup
a
six
pack
drank
that
in
an
evening
and
still
wanted
more
this
beer
is
ok
and
blended
good
d
a
very
good
offering
from
bbc
deep
rich
flavors
and
a
great
smoothness
makes
this
a
good
brew
d
very
sweet
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
a
dessert
beer
a
little
heavier
than
most
ales
but
lighter
than
a
porter
or
stout
poured
a
deep
clear
brown
with
reddish
highlights
the
head
was
tan
and
creamy
the
aroma
was
largely
malty
sweet
the
initial
flavor
was
thickly
malty
with
some
faint
hop
bitterness
coming
through
there
was
a
faintly
licorice
and
woody
taste
with
some
syrup
flavor
while
it
was
not
cloying
the
combination
of
above
flavors
kept
this
one
from
being
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
chewy
with
moderate
carbonation
this
was
far
from
my
ideal
brown
ale
drinkability
this
one
is
just
light
enough
to
drink
a

and
tasty

bluegrass

exceptions

im

could

of
these

version
of

but
a

profile
this
one
isnt

bad
but
the
main
issues
are
the
thinness
and
the
watery
taste
and
feel
and
it
could
be
better
balanced
for
sure
id
give
it
a
try
just
to
check
it
out
but
i
would
pick
a
better
nut
brown
for
a
regular
if
you
are
looking
for
something
complex
then
this
is
not
your
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
different
but
not
too
out
there
then
this
is
a
good
choice
to
mix
it
up
a
bit
d
this
is
an
awesome
nut
brown
that
i
wish
i
could
get
more
of
it
has
a
very
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
get
the
chance
this
one
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
a
little
nuttiness
the
taste
is
just
as
sweet
there
is
no
hop
presence
and
the
nutty
flavor
just
isnt
strong
enough
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
but
little
carbonation
there
is
little
alcohol
to
this
one
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
greatest
of
the
style
there
are
many
other
great
nut
brown
ales
i
would
pick
up
before
this

average
beer
brown
ales
always
seem
boring
to
me
so
this
basically
fits
the
bill
easy
to
drink
with
a
suprisingly
creamy
mouthfeel
a
good
brown
ale
the
taste
is
light
and
simple
but
very
pleasant
with
chocolate
nuts
leaves
plus
a
hint
of
cola
the
flavours
are
simple
and
light
but
good
and
persistent
the
feel
is
a
little
flat
from
low
carbonation
but
still
has
some
zestiness
to
it
and
a
hint
of
oiliness
it
has
light
sweetness
and
practically
no
bitterness
but
has
a
finish
that
is
nicely
somewhat
dry
leafy
and
nutty
it
has
enough
character
and
complexity
and
these
hold
up
enough
to
keep
it
tasty
and
interesting
as
well
as
very
drinkable
it
does

roasty
brown
malts
and
some
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
heavily
roasted
malts
but
theres
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
coming
in
at
the
end
im
not
sure
if
its
the
hops
or
something
else
an
alright
beer
but
there
are
much
better
browns
to
drink
da
nice
nut
brown
that
actually
manages
to
taste
fairly
nutty
very
drinkable
i
am
sure
i
could
knock
a
few
back
overall
nah
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
too
sweet
and
cloying
very
little
flavor
other
than
some
malt
and
chocolate
pass
on
this
1
d
overall
this
is
a
great
nut
brown
not
my
favorite
and
not
as
good
as
some
others
ive
tried
but
still
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
beer
is
mediumheavy
on
the
palate
and
has
low
levels
of
carbonation
giving
it
an
authentic
english
style
feel
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
palate
i
really
dont
see
anything
wrong
with
this
brew
at
all
everything
seems
to
be
a
positive
if
you
ask
me
this
is
one
id
definitely
pick
up
again
great
deal
for
the
price
and
great
beer
overall
as
i
mentioned
above
this
is
one
of
the
best
local
brews
ive
had
in
a
while
overall
great
beer
if
youre
in
the
area
pick
this
up
and
support
the
brewery
so
theres
no
real
head
and
the
palatal
presence
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
still
the
aroma
and
flavor
combine
to
bail
out
the
other
shortcomings
so
my
overall
satisfaction
is
higher
than
the
score
might
indicate
indeed
its
those
two
qualities
that
end
up
making
this
very
drinkable
and
very
pleasant
to
experience
so
the
stutters
dont
blur
the
massage
which
means
the
intent
is
safe
its
tasty
m
d
a
little
sparkling
carbonation
livens
it
up
a
bit
medium
body
and
reasonably
smooth
going
down
not
mindblowing
but
a
decent
and
worthy
drink
worth
checking
out
d
this
beer
has
it
all
except
a
taste
to
match
all
the
other
goodness
maybe
im
missing
something
here
beautiful
color
nice
aroma
and
great
mouthfeel
are
nearly
worthless
to
me
without
flavor
eric
d
better
than
average
drinkability
but
not
by
a
lot
could
definitely
have
two
in
a
night
but
wouldnt
be
having
many
more
bbcs
nut
brown
ale
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
hanging
out
on
top
the
nose
is
slightly
roasty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
trace
of
piny
hops
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
with
almonds
and
roastiness
showing
up
in
the
middle
this
beer
is
very
sweet
for
the
style
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
and
some
nice
toasty
breadiness
showing
up
a
bit
after
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
thin
to
me
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
though
sweeter
than
usual
my
lips
were
a
bit
sticky
aferwards
d
a
very
good
brown
ale
especially
with
sweet
brown
lovers
who
arent
afraid
of
a
little
hops
not
my
favorite
bbc
offering
although
im
very
impressed
with
that
brewery
they
make
some
good
stuff
the
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
sweet
roasted
malt
scent
its
almost
chocolatey
in
nature
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
thin
burnt
caramel
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
a
slight
nutty
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
nut
brown
but
nothing
special
the
aroma
is
awesome
but
the
taste
didnt
live
up
the
smell
had
a
nutty
sweetness
which
really
came
through
in
the
taste
the
sweetness
was
very
evident
which
made
for
a
very
nice
finish
without
any
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
but
overall
the
beer
was
very
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
it
would
make
a
very
nice
session
beer
id
definately
have
this
brew
again
if
it
was
cheap
and
on
tap
i
dont
think
i
would
go
hunting
for
it
though
ill
have
to
try
it
on
tap
the
next
time
im
down
in
louisville
i
picked
up
a
single
of
this
from
biggs
in
western
hills
oh
i
cannot
slam
this
beer
to
bad
because
it
is
from
the
bluegrassmy
alba
mater
is
nku
go
norse
this
brew
seemed
watery
thin
with
little
mouthfeel
the
taste
was
a
bit
chocalatey
but
not
very
pronounced
the
head
was
impressive
and
lacing
was
present
in
glass
it
drinks
ok
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
will
give
other
beers
from
this
little
gem
in
the
bluegrass
a
shot
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
one
of
the
better
nut
brown
ales
i
have
had
very
drinkable
beer
final
thought
this
is
a
oneofakind
brew
with
all
of
the
flavors
just
bursting
into
your
mouth
i
just
wonder
if
this
was
experimental
for
a
flavorful
and
tasty
brew
or
not
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
on
the
overall
but
not
great
and
probably
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
still
a
good
solid
brew
if
its
available
d
very
drinkable
and
would
probably
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
not
overly
flavorful
but
still
a
nice
beer
a
great
session
beer
from
bbc
that
i
would
put
up
against
a
lot
of
the
other
english
browns
on
the
market
today
its
also
nice
to
have
a
brown
ale
taste
so
nutty
without
being
full
of
fake
extract
like
so
many
others
im
talking
to
you
rogue
very
nice
overall
and
ill
be
buying
it
again
appearance
is
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
little
head
the
smell
is
pleasant
with
toasted
malt
and
an
earthy
scent
the
taste
is
a
mild
blend
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
nuttiness
the
aftertaste
is
rather
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
to
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
good
because
of
the
lightness
overall
a
decent
beer
but
lacks
character
this
is
not
among
my
favorite
brown
ales
drinkability
a
slightly
above
ale
here
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
slightly
dull
beer
worth
a
look
beer
poured
a
mahogany
brown
with
no
head
nose
is
of
toasted
chocolate
malts
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
chocalte
coffee
and
a
very
light
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
going
down
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
twist
on
the
brown
style
it
is
crossing
the
line
towards
a
stout
in
some
respects
it
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
for
brownstout
fans
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
to
a
tumbler
at
50
degrees
this
beer
was
a
nice
mahoganny
color
but
that
was
all
that
was
nice
about
it
it
had
a
thin
head
that
was
gone
in
30
seconds
the
smell
was
sour
and
the
taste
was
flat
there
was
no
indication
this
was
a
nut
brown
which
is
my
favorite
beer
type
in
fact
this
tasted
like
nothing
maybe
it
was
just
a
bad
example
but
i
will
not
purchase
again
drinkability
theres
nothing
exciting
about
this
brown
ale
but
it
might
be
worth
a
shot
especially
to
brown
ale
fans
very
easy
to
drink
and
almost
seems
a
bit
silky
this
was
built
for
quaffing
nice
example
of
the
stlye
nothing
overwhelming
just
a
nice
nutty
flavor
well
done
it
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
with
ruby
hints
around
the
edges
decent
offwhite
head
and
lacing
powerful
dark
chocolate
aroma
with
hints
of
roasted
coffee
and
nuts
quite
appealing
really
the
flavor
is
much
fainter
and
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
of
the
aroma
the
notverysweet
chocolatecoffee
notes
are
there
but
overall
the
flavor
is
very
weak
slight
nut
flavor
with
a
thin
barely
bitter
finish
its
watery
in
the
mouth
especially
the
carbonation
hardly
registers
im
really
disappointed
in
the
end
after
such
a
promising
start
drank
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
march
2009
bestby
date
pours
a
clean
opaque
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
no
retention
smells
of
toasted
barley
caramel
nuts
tastes
of
the
nuts
dark
chocolate
nice
balance
of
the
dark
sweet
flavors
with
a
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
for
this
style
but
not
too
much
so
an
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
fine
example
of
the
nut
brown
ale
a
perrinial
favorite
in
my
region
on
tap
therefore
this
is
my
first
bottle
review
certainly
as
high
quality
as
expected
but
lacks
the
nuances
that
i
find
on
tap
or
cask
that
make
it
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
still
looks
a
solid
brown
color
with
ruby
light
transmittance
impressive
creamy
head
retention
and
lacing
aromas
even
warm
didnt
give
me
the
malt
chocolate
character
that
i
usually
find
on
tap
lightly
woodsy
nutty
and
pungent
peatey
but
without
the
firm
body
to
support
the
flavors
as
well
as
i
expect
flavors
follow
suit
with
quality
malts
chocolates
walnuts
just
not
as
intense
as
i
like
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
sweet
and
less
thirst
quenching
that
at
the
pub
even
with
the
criticism
its
still
a
great
brown
ale
but
given
a
preference
ill
try
it
on
cask
any
day
12
ounce
bottle
says
its
best
before
february
2007
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
nuts
caramel
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
malt
taste
is
the
same
as
it
smells
it
starts
off
a
bit
sweet
and
finishes
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
i
was
hoping
there
would
be
some
more
substance
to
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
as
its
very
smooth
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
its
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
but
with
that
being
said
i
could
still
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
its
a
decent
sessionable
beer
and
id
buy
it
again
d
i
find
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
sweeterthannormal
brew
its
a
unique
tasting
brown
ale
and
not
just
a
newcastle
imitator
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
mild
grainy
astringency
lots
of
nutty
grainy
residue
brushing
along
the
palate
behind
the
slightly
thin
swallow
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
clean
session
beer
drinkability
on
the
short
list
for
sessionables
in
my
book
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
thick
off
white
head
very
clear
head
fades
quickly
no
lacing
nice
roasted
nut
smell
hints
of
molasses
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
slighly
bitter
roasted
nut
taste
this
beer
also
has
some
sort
of
chocolate
malt
chocolate
lactose
taste
kinda
sour
it
has
a
tootsie
roll
like
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
me
decent
amount
of
carbonation
easy
too
drink
this
is
just
not
my
favorite
style
of
brew
not
bad
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
all
in
all
its
a
drinkable
but
unchallenging
brown
ale
its
competently
executed
with
no
overpowering
notes
or
underlying
sourness
but
calling
this
a
nut
brown
ale
calls
for
comparison
to
other
nut
browns
and
theres
really
no
comparison
even
with
the
somewhat
thin
body
this
is
still
a
very
nice
brown
ale
i
would
gladly
drink
several
more
the
flavor
is
mild
overall
and
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
could
be
sessionable
as
it
is
not
huge
and
is
not
overly
sweet
worth
trying
chestnut
brown
with
tinged
ruby
highlight
hint
of
cocoa
powder
in
the
aroma
moderate
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
distinctive
chocolate
malt
note
in
the
middle
low
hops
bittering
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
seemed
a
little
on
the
thin
side
which
was
the
primary
detraction
not
quite
enough
to
hold
my
interest
for
a
session
beer
but
a
pleasant
beer
nonetheless
a
redish
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
the
scent
of
carmel
sweetness
and
some
nuttiness
comes
through
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
scent
sweetness
and
nutty
flavor
with
a
hoppy
finsh
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
very
smooth
going
down
i
would
like
to
have
less
hoppiness
at
the
and
more
of
the
nutty
flavor
still
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
think
i
will
go
have
another
one
right
now
this
one
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
has
ok
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
nutty
with
caramel
notes
and
faint
hints
of
fruit
smells
pretty
good
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
the
taste
is
mostly
caramel
flavors
with
some
nutty
notes
some
chocolate
and
it
has
a
slightly
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
body
and
a
stronger
caramel
flavor
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
ill
probably
buy
this
one
again
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
sparkling
clear
ruby
mahogany
body
with
a
small
beige
head
which
falls
into
a
lasting
collar
with
some
minimal
patch
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
toasty
and
nutty
malts
accented
by
some
golden
apple
and
ripe
pear
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
with
medium
carbonation
taste
has
a
touch
of
smooth
chocolate
toasted
malt
a
hint
of
ripe
pears
and
a
vague
nutty
character
that
seems
hazelnut
hops
are
restrained
but
add
a
delicate
bitterness
that
provides
a
nice
balance
light
bodied
and
tasty
enough
to
be
very
sessionable
but
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
of
the
tap
version
i
sampled
a
few
months
ago
at
the
brewpub
still
a
pretty
good
kentucky
brewed
brown
ale
pours
a
deep
deep
mahogony
color
with
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
modest
coat
over
top
nose
is
awesome
in
my
book
big
toasted
nuttyness
with
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
deeper
roast
very
well
balanced
and
very
enticing
flavor
is
very
good
as
well
dominated
with
the
toasty
nut
character
with
light
chocolate
hanging
behind
it
flavor
is
not
as
full
as
i
expected
feel
is
a
light
moderate
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
could
use
a
touch
more
body
definately
a
drinkable
beer
here
very
good
example
of
the
style
imo
balance
is
great
very
glad
to
see
this
one
in
bottles
ill
be
having
this
one
again
the
best
beer
of
the
day
here
and
should
have
stuck
with
htis
vs
trying
their
alt
tried
a
glass
of
this
at
the
bbc
in
the
cincinnati
airport
this
was
a
lot
better
than
the
last
time
i
tried
it
this
was
their
current
seasonal
selection
clear
dark
brown
with
a
medium
thick
beige
head
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nutty
along
with
a
touch
of
malt
nicely
smooth
with
a
roasty
and
nutty
character
malt
and
hops
are
also
present
in
the
flavor
the
finish
is
crisp
and
nutty
overall
my
experience
with
the
beer
this
time
around
was
much
more
favorable
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
rarely
drink
a
nut
brown
ale
so
i
had
this
beer
as
part
of
a
flight
of
4
ounce
tasters
it
looks
spot
on
for
an
english
ale
and
has
a
good
nutty
smell
the
taste
was
the
best
ive
ever
had
for
the
style
it
was
nutty
and
malty
in
perfect
balance
a
nice
smooth
finish
and
goes
down
really
easily
solid
brew
had
on
tap
perfect
to
style
dark
mahogany
with
large
tan
head
nutty
bready
malt
aroma
light
and
slightly
creamy
with
the
same
nutty
malt
taste
youd
expect
from
the
smell
could
use
a
little
more
bite
in
the
aftertaste
but
very
nice
overall
im
a
huge
fan
of
english
style
beers
and
brown
ales
so
taking
that
into
effect
this
is
a
great
example
let
it
warm
and
youll
find
that
the
smooth
cocoa
is
perfectly
integrated
into
the
beer
mouth
was
creamy
and
smooth
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
but
up
there
its
available
and
decently
cheap
homerun
amazing
taste
like
a
sweeter
new
castle
love
this
brown
ale
smooth
and
satisfying
the
way
a
brown
should
be
try
this
one
it
is
worth
it
overall
first
a
disclaimer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
nut
brown
ales
to
my
pallet
these
beers
lack
character
and
body
alesmiths
rendition
is
no
different
its
fine
for
what
it
is
now
im
going
to
go
drink
a
good
bitters
yeah
what
he
said
ill
have
another
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
made
versions
of
an
english
nut
brown
ale
that
ive
ever
had
its
absolutely
delicious
fans
of
brown
ales
should
definitely
give
it
a
try
im
certainly
going
to
get
some
more
of
this
flavors
of
dark
malt
cocoa
notes
of
molasses
and
licorice
slight
metallic
note
a
raisin
note
lingers
thin
mouthfeel
a
bit
slick
decent
beer
but
i
expected
more
from
this
world
class
brewer
verdict
a
nice
example
of
the
english
brown
ale
from
alesmith
its
simple
but
balanced
and
very
sessionable
at
just
5
abv
i
dont
often
crave
this
style
but
for
those
nice
crisp
fall
days
this
will
definitely
do
the
trick
o
a
decent
nut
brown
but
the
weakest
offering
ive
had
from
this
fine
brewery
appearance
is
brown
with
copper
edges
and
a
finger
of
fluffy
beige
head
that
stuck
around
for
eternity
and
left
thick
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
nutty
and
bready
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
but
it
is
not
as
bold
as
the
very
best
beers
of
this
style
the
body
is
not
quite
hearty
but
not
thin
either
the
finish
was
very
mildly
dry
and
bitter
dark
walnut
with
a
very
nice
creamy
head
on
the
surface
smells
nutty
as
the
name
would
suggest
toasted
malt
grainy
chocolate
toffee
and
leather
all
with
a
charred
edge
flavor
is
similarly
malty
but
with
more
of
an
earthy
hop
presence
dark
chocolaty
malt
nutty
coffee
and
just
a
bit
of
fruit
to
brighten
things
up
not
rich
more
bittersweet
and
clean
mediumlight
bodied
slightly
creamy
and
quite
drinkable
i
like
it
dark
brown
reddish
glow
where
the
light
hits
and
small
head
but
nice
lacing
aroma
is
cocoa
roasted
coffee
hazelnut
creamy
toffee
slightly
flowery
faint
bit
of
lemon
soap
and
other
nut
varieties
nice
basic
nut
brown
aromas
with
a
little
extra
character
of
its
own
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
chewy
biscuit
caramelly
malt
grains
soft
bitterness
and
flavors
of
malty
bread
nuts
and
again
coffee
and
cocoa
nicely
done
for
this
style
of
beer
which
i
find
i
dont
regularly
crave
very
easy
drinking
which
makes
it
appropriate
all
year
long
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
this
beeralthough
labeled
as
a
brown
ale
tastes
closer
to
a
porter
probably
the
earthiestsmokiest
and
least
sweet
brown
ive
had
to
date
small
amount
of
sweet
carmelmalt
to
start
and
finishes
with
a
smoke
or
burnt
steak
kinda
taste
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
that
is
still
seethru
with
a
very
slight
amber
hue
in
the
light
lacing
very
apparent
flavor
is
very
robust
for
only
5
low
alcohol
content
is
probably
why
the
bottle
describes
the
beer
as
sessionable
i
would
agree
with
that
but
only
during
cold
weather
months
if
your
a
porterstout
person
who
doesnt
like
browns
then
this
beer
would
probably
be
ok
with
you
overall
a
quality
beer
o
brown
ales
are
never
going
to
score
high
with
me
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
it
also
pairs
really
well
with
beef
like
really
well
id
buy
it
again
if
it
were
readily
available
in
my
region
alas
its
not
o
very
good
for
a
brown
ale
definitely
has
the
englishstyle
malt
taste
very
easy
drinking
yet
robust
im
surprised
its
only
5
percent
tasty
as
hell
though
well
packaging
sure
has
changes
on
this
since
the
one
shown
but
the
beer
in
the
bottle
remains
one
of
the
quintessential
american
made
examples
of
the
style
and
for
the
price
probably
the
best
at
least
to
my
knowledge
love
this
stuff
earth
tones
and
cocoa
of
the
semisweet
variety
are
the
primary
smell
and
flavor
elements
of
this
thin
looking
light
brown
beer
as
red
amber
as
it
is
brown
really
not
a
long
enough
lasting
head
for
me
but
it
shows
well
on
first
pour
add
to
the
cocoa
and
the
earthy
nuttiness
a
mild
vanilla
complex
a
minerality
in
the
water
profile
a
cola
weirdness
a
toffee
dessert
vibe
and
a
yeast
that
shows
elements
of
both
burton
and
california
ale
and
you
have
an
elegant
yet
sturdy
complex
yet
drinkable
bold
yet
forgiving
nut
brown
that
does
everything
i
want
it
to
and
nothing
i
dont
when
i
consider
that
this
bomber
is
widely
available
and
costs
between
6
and
7
dollars
i
realize
that
if
these
types
of
brown
are
your
jam
this
is
clearly
your
jelly
the
only
brown
ale
i
really
need
for
quite
some
time
rich
dark
brown
in
color
with
great
clarity
a
thin
layer
of
white
foam
rests
on
top
brussels
lacing
luscious
nutty
aroma
along
the
lines
of
hazelnut
and
caramel
greets
me
delicious
hazelnut
dominates
the
dark
malt
flavor
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
silky
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
great
for
the
style
and
something
id
certainly
have
again
o
longing
for
more
flavor
to
give
this
beer
a
higher
score
o
i
love
nut
brown
ales
and
this
is
definitely
an
example
why
extremely
rich
feeling
without
being
high
in
abv
good
flavor
and
excellent
texture
i
dont
generally
like
brown
ales
but
i
made
porcini
mushroom
risotto
and
someone
recommended
a
brown
ale
with
mushroom
risotto
so
i
got
it
great
decision
complimented
the
earthy
subtle
mushroom
flavors
with
a
mild
roasted
malt
flavor
crisp
from
the
appropriate
use
of
hops
and
cleansing
for
the
palate
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
darker
brew
that
doesnt
have
too
much
of
a
flavor
impact
great
tasting
maltcentric
brown
ale
somewhat
surprising
with
a
relatively
light
feel
and
color
but
the
head
and
the
flavor
really
standout
some
hop
bitterness
lurks
in
the
background
but
overall
this
is
a
fairly
sweet
and
nutty
brown
ale
that
should
please
most
fans
of
this
style
overall
above
average
to
mostly
good
beer
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
lot
more
interesting
than
a
lot
of
the
american
examples
that
ive
had
i
would
recommend
trying
this
alesmiths
nut
brown
ale
is
simply
what
newcastle
wants
to
be
when
its
all
grown
up
a
solid
brown
ale
that
feels
somewhat
thicker
than
most
sessionable
for
sure
good
but
not
great
enjoyable
brown
ale
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
but
very
smooth
creamy
and
sessionable
with
a
great
brown
ale
flavour
profile
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
at
4
99
a
bomber
its
a
solid
purchase
if
you
enjoy
brown
ales
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
brown
ale
good
toasty
malt
presence
with
good
notes
of
chocolate
biscuit
and
nuts
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
finishes
dry
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
example
of
an
english
style
brown
ale
overall
a
solid
drinkable
nutbrown
that
hits
all
the
benchmarks
of
the
style
roasty
nutty
with
hops
upfront
and
nutty
flavors
backing
it
up
22oz
bottle
brown
color
decent
head
aroma
is
a
bit
of
malt
vinegar
and
malts
more
malt
vinegar
in
the
flavor
but
this
is
what
i
usually
get
from
nut
brown
ales
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
in
fact
i
might
just
have
a
fucked
up
palate
overall
this
was
just
ok
and
while
i
am
glad
alesmith
came
to
co
i
will
be
buying
the
ipa
and
extra
pale
and
not
this
o
nice
toasted
tree
nut
flavor
and
a
light
sessionable
body
d
great
example
of
the
style
overall
a
really
enjoyable
brown
ale
im
glad
this
brewer
finally
distributes
in
colorado
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
soon
othis
is
a
welldone
brown
the
smell
in
particular
is
really
inviting
and
exhibits
great
intensity
and
balance
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
but
it
is
close
again
nice
balance
of
malty
flavors
with
just
the
right
kick
of
hops
the
feel
is
a
bit
odd
and
maybe
a
bit
light
but
it
actually
makes
the
beer
more
drinkable
than
other
browns
a
really
nice
session
or
almostsession
beer
at
5
abv
overall
an
easy
to
quaff
brown
ale
that
is
a
bit
hearty
along
with
a
strong
flavor
profile
this
beer
was
super
fresh
on
tap
and
it
really
shines
all
in
all
this
a
terrific
nut
brown
ale
thats
got
a
low
abv
so
its
great
for
sessioning
its
a
good
beer
for
cooler
weather
when
a
fruity
hoppy
beer
is
not
what
you
really
want
the
balance
is
perfection
as
per
usual
with
alesmith
beers
and
this
one
grants
enough
sweetness
to
reward
the
palate
and
enough
bitter
to
keep
you
wanting

i
go
for
but

with

overall
a
very
smooth
tasty
brown

with
a
great

overall
this

is
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
a

by

and
finished
with
a

and
overall
its
quite
enjoyable
and
i
have
to
admit
spot
on
to
the
english
style
you
dont
get
many
brews
that
claim
it
and
pull
it
off
but
these
guys
do
cheers
d
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
theres
lot
of
good
stuff
going
on
here
especially
the
aroma
however
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
could
use
a
little
more
umph
with
a
couple
of
minor
tweaks
this
one
could
be
elevated
from
very
good
to
excellent
o
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
yet
still
manages
to
pack
in
a
ton
of
flavors
of
nutty
malts
it
is
quite
sessionable
and
also
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
this
style
supremely
drinkable
very
english
in
flavor
great
malt
profile
poured
from
tap
into
pint
at
papago
in
scottsdale
pours
a
nice
brown
with
tan
head
and
good
lacing
nice
sweet
nutty
aroma
taste
is
really
nice
perfectly
malty
and
nutty
slight
sweetness
and
nice
balance
with
the
slight
hop
overall
a
damn
near
perfect
nut
brown
nice
brew
poured
an
excellent
dark
brown
with
off
white
head
that
looks
ruby
red
when
held
up
to
a
light
the
scent
was
excellent
rich
roasted
malt
toffee
nutty
notes
and
a
bit
of
dark
coffee
were
all
present
on
the
nose
very
enticing
the
flavor
delivered
on
this
promise
beginning
with
a
hit
of
roast
malt
moving
into
toffee
and
roast
malt
and
finishing
with
rich
nutty
notes
and
a
slight
coffee
like
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
carbonation
that
made
the
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
the
body
was
mediumlight
which
contributed
to
this
ease
an
all
around
excellent
brown
ale
easily
the
best
ive
tried
as
of
this
date
a
decent
beer
but
it
is
a
little
dry
and
fizzy
for
the
style
i
dont
mind
it
thanks
jay
for
picking
this
up
downstate
great
stuff
this
so
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
especially
at
the
price
4
or
5
99
i
think
very
tasty
brown
ale
well
worth
seeking
out
a
bottle
from
lets
pour
pours
dark
brown
with
large
white
head
admittedly
overaggressive
pour
nutty
malty
smell
bit
of
darker
fruits
but
nothing
to
call
home
about
hoping
the
flavor
offers
more
as
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
nice
chocolatey
and
nutty
flavor
very
light
and
easy
drinking
with
a
smoothness
that
creates
some
thickness
ok
brown
ale
but
would
have
liked
a
tad
more
bold
flavor
and
aroma
they
are
there
but
a
bit
light
artfully
crafted
as
alesmith
beers
usually
are
the
malt
choice
is
perfect
for
creating
a
beer
that
is
delightfully
complex
in
flavor
and
sessionable
in
body
so
happy
that
this
beer
made
it
to
bottles
and
it
deserves
a
shot
to
make
it
into
your
fridge
when
allowed
to
warm
up
to
cellar
temperature
this
beer
shines
opening
with
a
blend
of
caramel
and
toasted
bread
drizzled
with
burnt
sugar
and
brown
sugar
this
is
wellconstructed
flavors
of
vanilla
and
oatmeal
are
also
present
mediumlow
hop
character
is
present
mostly
as
bitterness
with
a
little
flavor
with
the
earthy
notes
and
green
bitterness
blending
harmoniously
with
the
burnt
sugar
bitterness
and
the
toffee
flavors
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
faint
fruit
note
moderate
toast
and
burnt
sugar
flavors
this
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
moderately
carbonated
and
excellent
on
the
palate
so
soft
and
creamy
i
imagine
this
is
a
treat
on
cask
highly
recommended
overall
i
am
so
floored
that
this
beer
has
made
it
to
bottles
as
i
have
always
wanted
to
sample
this
offering
from
alesmith
i
am
really
fond
of
a
quality
brown
or
amber
ale
but
there
are
so
few
quality
made
ones
these
days
because
breweries
just
mail
them
in
and
focus
on
their
next
imperial
or
barrelaged
creation
this
is
a
perfect
food
session
or
anytime
beer
for
its
balanced
flavor
profile
and
extremely
high
drinkability
this
may
be
the
best
american
made
english
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
if
not
definitely
in
the
top
3
o
this
is
a
very
nice
nut
brown
light
refreshing
and
loaded
with
great
flavor
very
nicley
done
i
would
recommend
this
brown
ale
to
anyone
overall
a
very
enjoyable
sessionable
nut
brown
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
it
is
up
there
i
will
certainly
pick
this
one
up
again
makes
for
a
great
fall
beer
one
of
the
very
best
browns
ive
ever
had
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
nice
billowy
foamy
tan
head
that
settled
down
after
a
bit
to
a
light
cover
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
cherry
with
a
couple
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
cocoa
old
leather
tobacco
flavors
slightly
sweet
with
a
very
good
balance
between
that
bitter
and
carbonic
tang
also
malt
cocoa
and
a
bit
of
roast
body
is
just
right
full
yet
very
drinkable
and
great
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
session
and
just
plain
very
tasty

nice
2
finger
fairly
dense
light
khaki
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
aromas
of
big
caramel
biscuit
toffee
toast
nuttiness
chocolate
molasses
light
dark

excellent
aromas
with

lingering
notes
of

biscuit
toast
nuttiness
chocolate
and

on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
nicely
robust
flavors
with
good
balance
no
cloying
sweetness
at
all
on
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
creamy
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
zero
warming
noticed
on
the
finish
as
expected
of
5
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
nice
robustness
and
balance
of
flavors
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
all
around
great
and
well
put
together
taste
is
nutty
and
sweet
to
start
a
touch
tart
in
the
middle
and
the
grain
flavors
really
come
out
with
a
light
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
yet
another
good
alesmith
brew
overall
not
that
memorable
for
a
brown
ale
unfortunately
more
nutty
than
the
smell
indicates
lots
of
chocolate
initially
on
the
tongue
better
hop
presence
on
the
swallow
but
it
is
still
light
like
a
traditional
brown
ale
aftertaste
is
not
potent
but
it
lasts
a
long
time
richer
than
most
brown
ales
which
i
typically
find
to
be
too
thin
overalls
real
nice
brown
very
drinkable
perfect
fall
evening
companion
gone
too
soon
nut
brown
ale
is
an
interesting
beer
from
alesmith
its
not
a
big
beer
at
all
but
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
lofty
standards
alesmith
has
set
for
itself
this
is
one
tasty
english
brown
ale
if
youre
looking
for
something
malty
delicious
and
not
too
big
give
this
one
a
shot
it
rocks
o
a
solid
nut
brown
ale
this
is
a
style
i
like
brown
ales
in
general
especially
during
octoberfest
time
unfortunately
there
arent
a
lot
of
good
ones
that
readily
come
to
mind
and
at
the
price
i
paid
for
this
i
think
it
was
6
99
for
the
bomber
which
would
be
a
20
sixer
ounceforounce
i
wont
be
coming
back
to
it
with
any
regularity
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
overall
a
nice
beer
well
done
nut
brown
ale
one
of
the
first
beer
styles
i
really
liked
when
i
first
got
into
beer
its
hard
to
find
a
good
nut
brown
beer
these
days
doesnt
seem
like
anyone
really
makes
it
outside
of
england
its
a
nice
type
of
beer
for
cooler
style
weather
a
rainy
day
or
when
you
need
a
nice
malty
beer
without
a
big
profile
and
sweetness
its
a
well
done
nut
brown
too
so
cheers
to
alesmith
for
continuing
to
makes
some
great
beers
and
lesser
made
styles
o
would
get
this
again
classic
nut
brown
ale
that
is
really
smooth
and
enjoyable
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
englishstyle
brown
ale
easily
rivals
hazelnut
brown
nectar
in
the
brown
ale
category
and
is
just
generally
delightful
i
rarely
come
across
a
beer
which
so
wonderfully
represents
its
claimed
style
and
is
simply
supertasty
to
boot
there
are
almost
certainly
recipe
tweaks
which
could
make
this
beer
better
but
i
sure
cant
tell
you
what
they
are
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
a
dark
mahogany
amber
a
fine
one
finger
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
toasted
malt
nuts
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
follows
with
nuts
toasted
and
caramel
malt
slightly
sweet
finishes
with
nuts
and
a
hint
of
char
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
a
very
nice
nut
brown
ale
im
glad
that
alesmith
has
made
it
up
to
seattle
pours
a
dark
brownish
amber
color
with
a
taupe
colored
head
nutty
earthy
chocolaty
and
grassy
aromas
comprise
the
bouquet
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
full
and
creamy
as
the
nose
had
led
my
palate
to
anticipate
it
is
a
little
thin
and
on
the
watery
side
the
flavor
was
even
more
of
a
disappointment
some
nuttiness
but
nothing
extraordinary
some
lactose
and
coffee
acidity
plus
this
beer
seems
to
drink
more
like
a
stout
than
a
brown
pretty
unremarkable
not
a
good
effort
by
alesmith
o
great
english
brown
ale
relatively
light
but
oh
so
creamy
and
smooth
makes
it
super
drinkable
great
balance
of
flavors
this
might
vie
for
the
throne
that
is
samuel
smith
nut
brown
exceedingly
drinkable
just
the
right
amount
of
nuttytoasted
aftertaste
nice
odyessir
i
have
begun
to
really
enjoy
brown
ales
this
one
is
excellent
mild
yet
complex
long
finish
plenty
of
different
flavor
components
i
could
drink
this
and
be
thoroughly
satisfied
most
days
of
the
week
alesmith
is
one
of
those
breweries
that
does
no
wrong
with
me
wanted
to
love
this
one
but
i
guess
my
memory
was
kind
i
have
had
much
better
brown
ales
though
its
important
to
stress
that
this
one
is
not
at
all
bad
just
a
welldone
example
that
sticks
to
the
middle
of
the
road
o
a
really
nice
brown
ale
nut
flavors
are
done
very
well
super
drinkable
stuff
doa
this
is
a
good
beer
nut
brown
is
an
excellent
american
take
on
an
english
brown
ale
it
gives
a
pleasant
spin
to
the
style
without
overly
challenging
the
palate
and
still
packing
each
sip
and
whiff
with
flavor
this
probably
isnt
a
beer
that
will
ever
be
part
of
a
fad
or
have
legions
of
fans
and
thats
understandable
however
it
is
exactly
the
sort
of
beer
that
one
could
happily
drink
day
in
and
day
out
o
a
lighter
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
versatile
to
pair
with
a
range
of
entrees
and
desserts
the
bottled
version
is
new
having
been
introduced
may
30
2012
according
to
the
brewery
it
is
listed
at
5

on
the
usual

type
of
label
that
alesmith
uses

in
giant
letters
cheers
a
terrific
brown
o
solid
brown

with
a
very
nice
roast
characteristic
without
having
that
roast

off
the
sweetness
some

and
cocoa
notes
medium

slightly
mouth
coating
prefect
carbonation
level
kept
thinking
of
dogfish
indian
brown
the
entire
time
and
needed
to
remind
myself
of
the
disparity
in
abvs
while
not
quite
as
complex
still
full
flavored
a
very
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
even
bodied
den
drinking
and
outright
delicious
in
the
swallow
oa
tasty
brown
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
could
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
overall
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
but
this
one
could
get
me
to
change
my
opinion
too
many
brown
ales
lack
the
body
that
i
like
in
a
beer
this
isnt
the
case
here
big
bold
flavors
a
very
well
done
take
on
the
style
nautical
nut
brown
ale
has
a
dark
brown
body
that
does
not
quite
make
it
to
black
a
small
dark
tan
head
stuck
around
for
a
few
minutes
before
capping
leaving
some
sticky
lace
the
smell
consists
of
dark
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
and
some
old
coffee
the
taste
is
huge
on
the
malts
with
alot
of
nuttiness
some
coffee
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
to
round
it
out
the
english
yeast
strain
jumps
out
here
and
there
making
this
even
more
layered
the
feel
was
just
about
as
full
as
needed
to
be
a
bit
chewy
towards
the
end
which
expanded
the
feels
depth
the
carb
was
pretty
spot
on
as
wel
i
enjoyed
my
glass
and
drank
it
in
no
time
im
not
a
big
fan
of
nutty
brown
ales
but
i
could
easily
drink
some
more
of
this
full
of
flavor
and
life
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
some
nutty
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
toasted
nuts
and
slight
coffee
on
the
finish
a
nice
mild
roasty
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
with
an
awesome
flavor
to
it
dr
drinkable
but
underwhelming
especially
for
the
brewery
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
if
other
alesmith
beers
were
available
brown
ale
fans
will
be
satisfied
on
tap
at
stone
bistro
a
very
good
brown
rich
and
malty
rather
very
good
for
the
style
nutty
flavourfull
chocolate
malt
smooth
middling
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
when
you
are
up
for
a
sessionable
beer
that
is
not
ultrahoppy
it
all
helps
to
have
understated
carbonation
t
lots
of
nutty
malts
some
day
old
coffee
grounds
hazelnut
and
roasted
malt
something
about
the
taste
told
me
this
beer
was
old
it
seemed
faded
and
i
remember
liking
it
a
lot
more
the
last
time
i
tried
it
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
might
be
a
bit
tough
in
the
grading
of
this
one
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
rich
brown
in
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
stayed
on
top
forever
seriously
this
had
to
have
looked
better
then
damn
near
anything
else
i
have
run
across
recently
no
joke
just
perfect
aroma
is
dark
fruits
lots
of
sweet
brown
sugary
notes
hints
of
clove
and
light
earthy
hops
all
mixing
together
nearly
perfectly
at
this
point
in
time
nice
smooth
even
carbonation
and
feel
here
now
as
well
really
well
placed
i
have
to
admit
rich
warm
flavor
here
nice
mix
of
pear
light
spice
hints
at
brown
sugar
and
a
nice
even
caramel
flavored
dry
finish
solid
nut
brown
with
everything
you
pretty
much
expect
in
a
brown
ale
not
too
rich
but
not
thin
drinkable
and
refreshing
drink
it
wasnt
the
best
brown
ale
but
still
pretty
good
a
bit
watery
and
just
a
bit
small
id
like
to
give
this
another
go
with
a
full
pint
to
see
how
it
changes
with
temp
o
highly
drinkable
brown
sessionability
super
high
red
berry
flavors
do
the
nuts
justice
sweet
cranberry
flavors
up
the
ease
of
drinking
not
a
typical
brown
but
good
on
draft
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
small
light
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
good
almond
nuttiness
some
caramel
light
brown
sugar
some
light
peanut
and
some
light
coffee
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
some
brown
sugar
then
a
strong
almond
nuttiness
the
finish
has
a
light
coffee
bitterness
medium
body
medium
carbonation
personally
i
would
prefer
something
with
more
hop
factor
but
really
done
to
perfection
by
alesmith
i
could
drink
this
brew
anytime
overall
with
this
full
rich
flavored
and
light
body
beer
i
could
drink
this
year
round
tastes
are
cashews
almonds
brown
malt
an
esb
mixed
with
some
rye
caramel
trail
mix
and
peanuts
smells
like
a
good
time
at
the
pub
with
all
your
friends
buying
beer
right
there
with
you
i
like
this
one
because
its
a
good
brown
from
a
great
brewing
company
do
this
englishstyle
brown
ale
by
alesmith
is
exactly
what
one
would
hope
for
in
such
a
beer
with
an
excellent
and
full
flavor
profile
but
no
misplaced
attempt
to
reinvent
or
modify
the
style
nutty
malts
are
showcased
here
and
are
so
satisfying
to
the
palate
acidity
is
careful
to
stay
hidden
never
felt
or
tasted
in
a
distracting
way
the
smell
seems
a
bit
anemic
compared
to
the
taste
imitating
it
without
really
advertising
effectively
the
reality
of
brown
alesespecially
those
produced
in
brewpubsis
often
a
letdown
so
this
contribution
from
alesmith
is
muchneeded
to
shore
up
the
reputation
of
the
style
anyone
that
enjoys
a
porter
of
average
abv
would
find
this
beer
satisfying
nice
feel
perhaps
a
bit
dry
from
the
roasted
influence
and
lacking
the
brightness
of
a
samuel
smith
yet
solid
nonetheless
pleasant
carbonation
and
well
balanced
somewhat
dry
and
smoky
for
the
style
for
the
mild
beer
drinker
you
may
be
scared
off
by
the
look
of
nautical
nut
brown
its
very
dark
however
its
not
thick
its
not
too
rich
its
just
right
and
has
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
brown
ale
if
you
dislike
porters
or
maybe
even
stouts
dont
be
afraid
to
try
this
its
not
too
powerful
overall
compare
to
new
belgium
fat
tire
with
more
mouthfeel
and
highlighting
individual
flavors
a
good
afternoon
beer
light
enough
to
not
be
overwhelming
heavy
enough
to
taste
and
enjoy
the
flavors
overall
i
would
call
this
a
session
ale
admit
it
is
above
4
but
by
american
expecations
and
standards
it
has
the
ease
of
going
down
smooth
the
low
abv
to
easily
have
more
than
one
and
a
complexity
that
is
delicious
d
very
drinkable
on
a
cool
southern
california
evening
this
is
a
great
brown
brew
and
cant
wait
to
try
it
from
a
bottle
d
it
drank
very
good
and
went
pretty
damn
good
paired
with
some
cajun
style
gumbo
this
is
a
great
offering
from
alesmith
and
i
hope
one
day
i
will
see
it
in
a
bottle
carbonation
is
just
right
for
a
strong
medium
bodied
brew
i
could
gladly
drink
a
few
of
these
d
nicely
balanced
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
i
do
enjoy
a
good
brown
ale
and
this
is
definitely
one
that
is
worth
sitting
with
all
night
d
very
drinkable
tasty
session
brown
d
overall
its
a
good
everyday
sort
of
brown
ale
nothing
mind
blowing
just
a
good
beer
thats
worth
picking
up
sometime
to
try
on
tap
at
stone
appears
dark
brown
with
a
frothy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
malt
with
a
decided
nuttiness
and
a
restrained
yet
elegant
sweetness
the
flavor
portrays
a
light
sweetness
with
a
moderate
toasted
nut
and
a
toasted
malt
presence
theres
a
light
earthy
hop
presence
and
bitterness
the
full
flavor
belies
the
modest
abv
a
truly
great
beer
especially
when
considering
the
low
abv
perfect
for
one
of
the
two
allowable
drinking
periods
in
england
that
were
imposed
on
shell
production
workers
during
world
war
i
this
is
one
of
those
draftonly
alesmith
releases
that
i
always
seem
to
pass
up
on
visits
to
san
diego
but
im
really
glad
that
i
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
this
time
around
while
not
overly
complex
this
had
a
full
richness
of
flavor
to
it
that
really
made
this
a
pleasant
quaff
nicely
done
d
im
not
always
the
biggest
fan
of
brown
ales
as
they
tend
to
be
a
bit
sweet
but
this
had
a
nice
combination
of
nutty
and
toasted
flavors
that
i
found
inviting
they
took
their
time
when
they
crafted
this
beer
maltiness
and
roast
are
spot
on
i
cant
tell
you
how
many
people
ive
switched
from
newcastle
to
nautical
if
im
in
a
joint
for
the
first
time
and
i
see
this
on
tap
i
know
that
im
safe
i
may
look
for
others
that
i
havent
tried
first
but
i
know
that
i
can
always
have
a
nautical
and
be
completely
satisfied
not
much
carbonation
and
very
smooth
the
nutty
smoothness
is
a
little
dangerous
because
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
toasty
smell
and
lingering
malt
are
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
brown
ale
and
this
brew
always
exceeds
my
needs
an
absolute
staple
at
my
bar
i
was
glad
to
try
this
tap
only
offering
that
never
makes
it
up
north
it
is
a
well
crafted
brown
ale
deep
brown
with
a
thin
tan
cap
good
head
retention
and
there
was
a
bit
of
spotty
lace
that
clung
to
the
glass

there
was

light
bodied
with

texture
and

draught
at

office
dark
brown
with
a
medium
beige
head
toasted
bread
light
roast
coffee
and
light
spicy
hop
aromas
the
flavor
has
light
toffee
and
sweet
caramel
with
coffee
and
light
burntroasted
flavors
and
some
dark
chocolate
mediumlight
body
with
overly
fizzy
carbonation
the
flavor
profile
is
spot
on
but
the
malt
could
be
a
little
more
substantial
and
the
carbonation
was
too
high
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
recall
having
a
solid
brown
that
doesnt
try
and
overpower
the
subtle
flavors
certainly
worth
a
shot
for
the
record
i
am
not
100
certain
that
i
understand
what
is
meant
by
average
here
for
a
brown
ale
is
that
newcastle
sam
smith
downtown
brown
or
is
this
average
in
overall
beers
with
its
low
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
for
the
record
i
am
a
devout
alesmith
fan
tod
keep
it
up
i
blame
the
distro
i
love
your
work
poured
like
milk
from
a
growler
the
only
way
to
get
head
from
a
growler
it
produces
on
fingers
worth
of
head
this
beer
separates
the
light
into
three
darker
ambers
like
an
out
of
focus
monochrome
abstract
beatifull
or
maybe
ive
allready
had
too
much
its
smell
is
like
fire
roasted
nuts
and
a
slight
maltiness
taste
is
similar
to
a
smoked
porter
but
lighter
and
there
are
definitely
some
nuts
in
there
somewhere
i
just
cant
get
to
them
light
carbonation
and
very
dry
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
i
am
sessionning
it
to
my
wifes
dismay
gotta
love
the
alesmilth
guys
and
gals
poured
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
nuts
malts
and
caramel
taste
is
so
smooth
caramel
maybe
some
syrup
and
nuts
a
slight
cocoa
roastiness
on
the
end
with
caramel
maple
syrup
and
more
nuts
a
very
good
nut
brown
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
at
4
6
abv
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
pretty
tasty
good
drinkability
overall
average
abv
for
a
brown
ale
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
and
not
too
bitter
either
i
think
i
still
prefer
newcastle
over
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
pass
up
on
the
opportunity
for
a
little
more
nautical
brown
ale
went
to
alesmith
today
to
fill
my
growler
tasted
a
few
and
the
nautical
was
my
last
maybe
could
have
weakened
my
palate
a
bit
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
the
brown
and
usually
browns
i
dig
nice
color
smelled
better
than
tasted
it
did
have
some
good
nutty
flavors
and
a
mild
hoppy
finish
but
that
is
what
alesmith
strives
for
was
hoping
that
it
tasted
as
good
as
my
olfactory
sensed
but
fell
a
little
short
i
would
have
it
again
but
not
in
the
top
ranks
of
browns
i
love
tap
obriens
pours
clear
brown
with
a
shortlived
offwhite
head
aroma
of
nuts
and
caramel
more
nuts
in
the
taste
almonds
hazelnuts
peanuts
nice
blend
of
caramel
and
cocoa
and
a
slightly
smoky
finish
im
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ale
but
this
was
very
good
good
complex
brew
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
not
all
year
count
it
had
this
bad
boy
on
tap
at
the
yard
house
in
brea
arrived
with
a
minimal
head
nice
dark
brown
with
auburn
highlights
the
beer
was
poured
way
to
cold
which
the
yard
house
is
infamous
for
doing
so
initial
smell
and
taste
are
dulled
upon
letting
the
beer
warm
i
am
greeted
by
a
nice
array
of
nutty
smells
and
malts
the
taste
is
smooth
and
complex
i
get
hints
of
roasted
hazelnuts
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
sweet
malts
mothfeel
is
nice
decent
amount
of
carbonation
very
easy
drink
i
am
not
surprised
tht
alesmith
of
all
people
would
put
out
a
beer
like
this
pours
a
clear
brownish
orange
coppery
in
the
light
thin
tan
head
forms
settles
to
a
ring
some
chunks
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
quite
nutty
and
toasty
some
caramel
biscuits
grain
light
floral
not
much
going
on
kind
of
subdued
taste
is
similar
nuts
and
toast
light
fruits
biscuits
and
bread
caramel
bit
of
floral
hopping
not
much
again
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
for
exciting
even
for
a
nut
brown
try
it
if
you
see
it
but
it
didnt
do
much
for
me
on
tap
at
stone
world
brewing
bistro
and
gardens
pours
dark
brown
almost
opaque
with
a
nice
thin

roasted

flavor
begins
sweet
and
then
becomes
roasty
and
carmelly
sweet
flavors
of
crisp
malt
and
cocoa
dominate
the
palate
by
far
the
best
brown
ale
out
there
this
beer
arrived
a
dark
leatherly
brown
with
shimmering
hues
of
ruby
red
the
aroma
is
sweet
lots
of
toffee
and
some
butterscotch
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
sweet
upfront
then
the
toffee
and
butterscotch
comes
on
in
while
a
minor
note
of
hops
plays
second
fiddle
unlike
a
number
of
americanmade
brown
ales
this
one
hs
an
excellent
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
just
plain
easy
to
drink
and
i
wish
they
bottled
this
brew
had
oncask
at
hamiltons
brown
like
you
would
expect
with
no
head
smells
faintly
of
malt
caramel
and
nuts
taste
is
all
about
caramel
and
nuts
excellent
flavors
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
and
creamy
this
beer
seems
to
really
benefit
from
being
served
from
a
cask
as
ive
also
had
it
ontap
and
it
wasnt
quite
as
good
the
other
great
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
factor
its
low
in
alcohol
and
goes
down
incredibly
easy
definitely
something
you
could
drink
all
night
good
but
im
still
not
a
brown
ale
believer
if
i
only
had
one
beer
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
fit
the
bill
nicely
d
at
under
5abv
this
is
a
standout
brown
session
ale
that
is
smooth
and
delicious
i
recently
drank
about
6
pints
over
the
course
of
a
few
hours
at
a
local
lounge
and
was
feeling
fine
all
night
long
this
is
one
of
only
two
core
styles
that
alesmith
doesnt
bottle
but
i
look
forward
to
drinking
it
whenever
i
stumble
upon
it
at
fine
sd
bars
and
eateries
rich
creamy
and
full
bodied
for
4
8
would
definitely
try
again
also
saw
this
at
the
tap
room
in
san
diego
i
love
that
place
just
in
case
you
were
wondering
a
little
light
on
body
but
not
distractingly
so
a
great
tasting
beer
that
you
can
go
through
several
pints
of
d
a
great
sessionable
ale
a
great
choice
ontap
by
alesmith
if
you
can
find
it
and
want
a
lighter
but
still
fullflavored
beer
a
very
solid
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
highly
recommended
i
look
forward
to
getting
it
again
drinkability
this
is
extremely
sessionable
stuff
its
fullflavored
but
light
on
the
alcohol
and
not
so
onedimensional
that
it
would
get
boring
very
quickly

easy

touches

and
full
of

yet
having

something
that
makes
this

considering
the

i
guzzled
this
down
and
would
gladly
choose
this
if
i
could
only
drink
one
beer
for
the

of
my

overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
with
the
low
alcohol
i
wish
it
was
more
available
it
is
a
winner
drinkability
was
quite
high
but
i
was
a
warm
day
a
decent
brown
d
good
i
would
have
liked
to
get
a
growler
of
this
for
further
review
but
when
presented
with
all
the
other
options
at
alesmith
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
get
the
brown
as
far
as
a
nut
brown
style
this
is
a
hard
one
to
beat
tasty
stuff
cheers
caught
alesmiths
nut
brown
ontap
at
obriens
down
in
san
diego
it
had
a
nice
brown
look
and
a
solid
head
nothing
in
the
scent
department
jumped
out
at
me
but
it
had
a
nice
nutty
but
not
overwhelming
taste
its
got
a
pretty
long
lingering
aftertaste
though
that
didnt
agree
with
me
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
there
was
nothing
else
i
wanted
to
try
on
draught
alesmith
brewing
company
medium
brown
with
a
large
head
of
very
light
tan
a
great
brown
ale
overall
with
a
lovely
aroma
showing
hints
of
toasty
roasty
and
caramel
malts
and
a
zesty
hearty
rich
and
meaty
malt
accented
flavor
tasty
tasted
this
brown
ale
at
the
alesmith
brewery
while
visiting
san
diego
area
this
brew
was
very
dark
brown
when
poured
with
a
fair
amount
of
tan
foam
and
loads
of
lace
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
was
very
evident
with
a
mild
aroma
of
hops
and
just
a
hint
chocolate
the
smell
and
aroma
is
just
what
i
got
nice
smooth
feeling
on
the
palate
what
a
mellow
brown
ale
well
balanced
with
a
rich
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
palate
i
could
have
sworn
this
was
a
porter
lots
of
burnt
smell
coffee
dark
brown
appearance
yet
light
on
the
palate
i
didnt
encounter
the
nuttiness
i
desired
with
this
style
it
was
there
but
hidden
deep
in
the
brew
i
hate
to
compare
but
the
samuel
smith
variety
stomps
all
over
this
in
my
opinion
as
it
shares
the
nuttiness
and
has
a
high
drinkability
along
with
refreshing
the
alesmith
brewery
is
outstanding
and
this
beer
is
recomended
as
it
stretches
the
edge
of
a
style
i
liked
the
fluid
body
as
it
easily
slid
down
to
paydirt
i
was
so
sure
it
was
a
porter
i
had
the
barkeep
pour
me
a
shot
glass
of
it
while
i
watched
and
sampled
it
yep
it
was
the
right
brew
still
good
taste
is
understated
simple
and
perfect
for
the
beer
dancing
the
line
between
dry
sour
malt
and
rich
chocolate
this
beer
is
smooth
and
doesnt
have
a
single
off
taste
theres
a
nice
chocolate
nuttiness
without
being
excessive
and
it
has
a
dry
finish
hops
are
unnoticable
in
this
beer
which
i
suppose
is
true
to
style
though
they
never
hurt
the
best
nut
brown
ive
had
since
samuel
smith
the
apperance
was
great
with
a
dark
chocolate
brown
color
and
slightly
off
white
head
the
smell
was
great
with
a
smell
of
nutella
and
malt
the
flavor
was
very
smoothe
and
refreshing
with
a
great
blend
of
nuttiness
malts
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
hops
in
the
finnish
a
excelent
brown
and
extremly
drinkable
this
beer
rests
in
my
glass
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
a
bright
brown
color
this
beer
has
a
subtle
nutty
aroma
to
it
there
is
a
nice
caramel
malt
sweetness
here
that
is
backed
up
by
toasted
malt
flavors
and
a
nuttiness
that
is
found
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
packed
with
solid
malt
flavors
that
just
jump
out
of
my
glass
this
is
one
of
the
best
nut
brown
ales
that
i
have
ever
had
probably
is
the
best
it
is
just
so
enjoyable
and
so
well
integrated
the
beer
as
it
spills
for
the
keg
into
the
appropriate
container
a
transparent
brown
the
head
prodigious
in
size
and
the
texture
spumous
the
color
a
toothsome
tan
with
the
lace
a
thick
and
sticky
sheet
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
slightly
floral
nice
nutty
malt
sweetness
fresh
and
crisp
with
the
start
somewhat
sweet
thickly
malted
and
the
top
fair
to
middling
in
feel
finish
has
a
nice
moderate
carbonation
and
the
hops
pleasingly
spicy
as
the
beer
warms
to
the
room
and
the
glass
quite
dry
and
a
decent
drinking
beer
certainly
not
the
worst
brown
ale
ive
tasted
but
do
like
most
all
the
other
alesmith
beers
better
than
this
one
still
worth
a
sample
whilst
not
as
memorable
as
some
of
the
other
alesmith
offerings
this
is
nevertheless
a
very
good
brown
ale
that
has
exceptional
drinkability

a
nice

overall
hoppy

whats
not
to
like
smooth
and
tasty
good
balanced
malt
taste
hmm
i
am
not
sure
i
like
the
fact
that
esb
is
on
the
label
to
me
this
is
a
wellmade
american
brown
ale
with
hefty
malts
and
a
good
deal
of
hops
working
off
of
those
grains
a
good
beer
but
the
label
threw
me
off
initially
dark
brown
color
and
yet
still
somewhat
penetrable
to
light
a
quarter
inch
of
tightly
knit
beige
head
sits
on
top
brussels
lacing
i
smell
dark
malt
and
just
a
faint
whiff
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
dark
malt
toffeeand
caramel
the
mouth
is
slightly
creamy
and
smooth
o
good
example
of
the
style
its
at
least
as
good
as
honkers
ale
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
the
balance
of
crisp
and
smooth
that
works
for
this
brown
ale
right
in
the
median
between
sweet
and
dry
oh
yes
i
like
hoppy
alternative
beers
such
as
black
ipas
or
india
browns
this
is
in
that
category
or
nice
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
has
fresh
hops
that
lean
towards
pine
with
hints
of
bitter
citrus
the
taste
is
even
through
the
entire
drink
there
is
presence
of
sweet
malt
with
bitter
hops
with
touches
of
pine
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
i
would
try
this
again
and
it
would
be
a
great
fall
session
beer
o
overall
a
good
beer
not
really
a
brown
but
i
imagine
they
were
aiming
for
their
own
style
i
buy
it
from
time
to
time
and
will
drink
it
again
dammit
a
lot
of
potential
wasted
for
love
of
a
dank
green
bud
there
are
worse
faults
i
guess
save
it

visit
i
loved
the
dark
rich
flavor
the
apperance
was
beautiful
felt
great
on
the
mouth
the
smell
made
me
want
more
wish
i
could
get
to
the
point
of
brewing
a
beer
like
this
some
people
are
comparing
this
to
a
good
homebrew
and
i
would
agree
its
a
wellbalanced
interesting
beer
that
could
be
sessioned
or
enjoyed
alongside
dinner
body
is
good
its
the
only
thing
about
this
beer
that
i
would
consider
above
average
sorry
bitch
creek
i
didnt
really
enjoy
you
i
didnt
dislike
you
either
but
damn
if
you
werent
boring
overallthis
one
drinks
like
an
imperial
red
not
a
bad
brew
especially
if
you
like
burnt
caramel
but
i
have
had
better
from
the
brewery
overall
well
this
beers
just
a
hot
mess
reminds
me
of
bad
generic
hoppy
american
amber
homebrew
sharp
poor
balance
and
well
gross
bottle
conditioning
gone
wrong
i
hope
the
amount
of
sediment
in
the
beer
is
actually
pretty
shocking
and
its
definitely
trub
and
hop
particulate
very
bad
i
feel
no
regrets
about
pouring
this
out
other
than
the
1
75
i
spent
on
the
bottle
all
that
and
it
wasnt
even
the
dark
englishstyle
esb
it
was
advertised
as
two
shades
more
caramel
and
this
would
definitely
be
classified
as
an
american
ipa
off
for
the
style
and
completely
undrinkable
i
rate
it
4
25
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
its
very
delicately
balanced
while
maintaining
a
very
full
and
forthright
flavour
profile
whats
more
its
remarkably
easy
to
drink
and
oddly
moreish
im
a
big
fan
bitch
creek
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
nice
long
lasting
head
their
is
a
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
a
harsh
sweetness
the
taste
has
a
malty
flavor
and
a
bit
harsh
with
a
slightly
hoppiness
that
comes
through
at
the
end
full
flavor
but
a
strange
harsh
sweetness
to
it
overall
not
a
bad
beer
worth
another
go
overall
interesting
take
on
an
esb
with
a
nod
to
a
brown
o
good
beer
interesting
take
on
the
style
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
the
6pack
othis
was
a
drinkable
and
slightly
different
take
on
the
brown
style
with
decent
flavor
and
a
concentrated
smell
i
would
have
preferred
more
malt
in
the
flavor
profile
but
nothing
here
was
completely
out
of
place
it
paired
nicely
with
the
chili
i
was
eating
overall
a
good
fairly
interesting
brew
a
lot
more
hop
character
than
i
expected
definitely
a
beer
id
consider
trying
again
though
its
not
high
on
my
priority
list
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
think
it
may
fit
better
in
the
brown
ale
category
albeit
with
a
few
more
hops
than
the
usual
example
picture
a
brown
ipa
because
of
this
its
characteristics
are
kind
of
out
of
the
ranges
of
good
esb
characteristics
id
like
to
see
more
sweet
caramel
and
less
toasted
and
nutty
malts
this
would
also
lighten
the
color
into
a
more
esbappropriate
range
id
also
like
to
see
more
earthy
and
floral
hops
rather
than
citrus
and
pine
some
earthiness
was
definitely
present
in
the
taste
but
not
so
much
in
the
aroma
regardless
of
all
of
this
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
and
its
certainly
drinkable
i
just
think
that
this
beer
would
be
better
suited
in
a
different
category
i
think
grand
teton
could
make
a
better
beer
that
would
be
much
better
suited
for
the
esb
style
i
like
it
its
a
nice
mix
of
an
esb
and
a
brown
ale
oa
decent
brown
that
is
neither
great
nor
horrible
much
preferred
to
a
newcastle
but
there
are
better
options
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
unconventional
hoppy
brown
ale
the
pour
is
a
decadent
looking
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
lively
off
white
head
as
tall
as
you
want
it
to
be
aroma
is
hop
heavy
on
top
of
well
roasted
chocolate
malt
and
an
ale
yeast
that
lends
some
seasonal
vibe
to
it
flavor
is
great
i
think
the
heavy
hops
on
top
of
a
sturdy
brown
ale
is
just
what
the
early
fall
is
calling
for
its
perfect
really
i
love
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
grappling
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
its
got
a
great
bite
in
the
finish
as
well
feel
is
fuller
bodied
for
sure
but
the
carbonation
is
rather
bright
and
the
combination
is
great
its
a
little
filling
but
its
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
get
some
medium
brown
color
and
is
somewhat
hazy
pours
with
an
enormous
head
smell
is
different
than
a
typical
brown
ale
chocolate
malts
present
but
a
hint
of
sour
taste
incorporates
the
chocolate
malt
and
the
sour
smell
may
be
derived
from
a
citrus
hop
mouthfeel
is
great
with
fine
bubbles
that
probably
contribute
to
the
large
head
pours
kind
of
cloudy
well
not
kind
of
cloudy
id
say
a
bit
too
much
so
really
this
one
is
pretty
earthy
with
bark
tones
to
it
when
you
let
it
warm
up
much
more
pleasant
than
i
was
anticipating
only
draw
back
is
a
mild
bitter
and
citric
thing
that
strikes
me
as
slightly
not
right
but
not
really
so
much
that
it
even
matters
this
is
a
nice
beer

throughout

the

the

was

roasted

nutty
dark

subtle

it
had

overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
i
was
really
quite
surprised
by
this
one
based
on
the
flavor
there
was
really
a
lot
going
on
in
this
one
that
i
usually
dont
find
in
this
style
that
was
a
very
welcomed
change
the
aroma
on
the
other
hand
could
have
used
a
little
work
as
it
was
quite
simple
nicely
done

that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
in
the

a

this

not

overall
this
brown
ale
is
just
a
bit
too
heavy
for
me
i
definitely
dont
regret
trying
it
but
one
is
enough
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
the
finish
is
better
than
the
mid
but
its
not
as
good
as
the
immediate
attack
well
balanced
with
a
good

overall
i
liked
this
i
am
not
a
huge
brown
fan
but
this
one
has
enough
to
keep
my
interest
and
consume
multiples
i
can
definitely
see
why
the
awards
keep
coming
to
this
ale
definitely
worth
a
shot
nice
offering
but
nothing
special
seems
to
be
more
of
a
brown
ale
than
an
esb
as
stated
on
the
label
o
this
beer
is
very
good
in
a
classic
way
not
overly
impressive
in
the
sense
that
it
wows
me
but
definitely
a
solid
output
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
too
often
however
if
it
was
offered
to
me
i
would
very
gladly
take
it
serving
type
bottle
o
great
taste
to
it
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
but
its
a
real
nice
blended
taste
different
than
other
brown
ales
ive
had
but
still
a
good
choice
especially
since
it
was
on
sale
when
i
got
it
the
taste
was
very
good
hoppy
for
a
brown
ale
taste
was
like
smell
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
d
nice
little
brown
ale
with
a
good
hop
profile
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
with
a
nice
transition
from
slightly
sweet
and
nutty
to
hoppy
and
slightly
bitter
overall
not
bad
o
a
good
beer
with
nice
balance
one
on
which
i
enjoyed
the
smell
more
than
the
taste
good
drinkability
4
medium
bodied
and
on
the
low
side
of
carbonation
overall
perfect
dark
nutty
beer
for
a
wintery
day
such
as
today
is
interesting
beer
but
not
for
me
seems
like
a
black
ipa
to
me
rather
then
a
brown
ale
opretty
well
balanced
brown
ale
that
could
be
and
excellent
everyday
beer
overall
a
good
beer
not
a
typical
brown
but
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
beer
with
some
very
rich
flavors
that
dont
come
off
as
bitter
or
artificial
which
alone
makes
this
an
excellent
brown
ale
if
youre
into
brown
ales
and
are
looking
for
some
flavor
to
your
beer
this
is
the
beer
for
you
loved
the
xx
version
of
this
high
hopes
for
the
everyday
version
it
pours
a
deep
russetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
light
maple
syrup
very
light
toasted
bread
pine
greens
and
plenty
of
cilantro
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
then
finishes
with
a
strong
bittercharryleather
character
that
malingers
for
a
while
and
ruins
any
good
that
precedes
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry

a
decent
brew
that
turns
all

with
a
nice
2
finger
tan
head
adequate
lacing
that
remains
throughout
very
good
looking
brown
not
an
overpowering
smell
but
notes
of
carmel
citrus
and
a
mix
of
malts
and
hops
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
a
strong
fruity
initial
surge
followed
off
by
subtle
hops
a
good
combination
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
full

maybe
a
bit
too
strong
on

end
feels
great
on

with

silky
and

with

a
solid
aba
with
an
interesting

good
mix

and
a

would
not
turn

down
tasty
poured
this
american
brown
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
brown
ale
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
it
produced
a
nice
tan
head
below
average
retention
it
does
leave
some
rings
of

spicy

finish
awesome
session
beer
nice
way
to
get
away
from
the
run
of
the
mill
brown
ales
that
are
out
there
o
a
tasty
beer
but
it
needs
more
on
the
nose
and
i
might
change
the
hops
up
a
bit
to
add
more
flavor
and
less
just
general
bitterness
the
beer
pours
out
mahogany
in
color
with
a
light
brown
head
on
top
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
largely
hoppy
54
ibus
of
pacific
northwestern
hops
but
it
has
some
underlying
sweet
malty
tones
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
of
roasty
biscuity
malts
with
a
splash
of
hop
bitterness
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
bitch
creek
finishes
surprisingly
dry
but
has
a
lingering
amount
of
hop
oil
left
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
sturdy
american
brown
ale
o
definitely
an
above
average
brown
which
are
hard
to
find
these
days
stressing
the
serving
temperature
as
it
makes
a
big
difference
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
a
bee
i
really
otherwise
wouldnt
have
had
but
i
have
no
intention
of
drinking
the
other
two
out
of
my
sampler
bitch
creek
definitely
will
bitch
slap
the
taste
out
of
your
mouth
with
the
herbal
bitterness
they
could
definitely
tone
that
down
and
this
would
be
a
great
beer
medium
to
light
consistency
in
the
mouthfeel
that
works
well
just
a
rock
solid
brew
overall
and
ill
be
looking
for
more
beers
from
this
brewery
i
have
a
hard
time
liking
some
browns
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
american
brown
ale
i
go
for
the
nutty
english
browns
usually
because
the
hops
that
brewers
choose
for
american
browns
just
dont
go
together
but
grand
teton
brewing
pulled
it
off
for
some
reason
this
reminds
me
of
a
dfh
ale
very
hoppy
and
experimental
without
being
an
ipa
im
going
to
have
to
remember
to
get
a
sixer
of
this
when
i
want
to
mix
it
up
in
the
winter
when
the
malts
are
king
wow
good
beer
here
i
like
it
and
i
got
a
ballcap
from
the
rep
to
boot
o
quite
surprised
by
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
so
i
made
it
a
point
to
grab
a
pack
at
the
store
when
i
got
the
chance
its
definitely
better
on
tap
but
i
am
enjoying
the
pack
at
a
leisurely
pace
especially
since
it
came
off
the
rotating
tap
at
gastropub
i
promised
myself
i
wouldnt
write
this
when
i
bought
the
bottle
but
im
so
impressed
by
it
that
i
just
cant
help
myself
bitch
creek
is
one
bitchin
ale
now
that
ive
gotten
that
out
of
my
system
a
more
serious
note
there
arent
many
american
brewers
anymore
who
can
grasp
the
english
pubstyle
ale
and
most
who
do
cant
often
pull
it
off
but
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
offering
that
tempts
men
to
sneak
out
of
the
house
for
cheeky
pint
overall
impression
great
brown
like
always
wish
it
wasnt
called
an
esb
but
for
those
who
drink
this
know
what
it
really
is
the
finish
is
where
you
get
just
a
hint
of
the
hops
for
me
there
is
just
a
touch
of
citrus
on
the
finish
that
really
completes
this
one
i
keep
licking
my
lips
afterwards
like
i
just
took
a
bit
of
sundae
it
may
sound
like
the
sweetness
is
over
the
top
but
it
is
not
this
nails
the
line
between
bittersweet
and
over
the
top
very
drinkable
wish
i
could
get
it
here
in
texas
oenjoyable
beer
good
taste
would
recommend
not
taking
to
small
of
sips
to
get
the
most
complex
flavors
o
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
the
nose
was
impressive
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
wish
we
could
get
bitch
creek
esb
without
first
taking
a
trip
of
several
hundred
miles
overall
this
a
great
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
crush
a
six
pack
easy
this
is
an
everyday
beer
that
should
be
at
every
bar
overall
a
very
nice
glass
of
beer
though
maybe
a
bit
out
of
place
in
the
heat
of
nc
right
now
o
very
impressed
by
this
beer
would
definitely
buy
again

ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
limited
lacing
aroma
consists
of
dry
caramelized
sugar
with
nice
notes
of
biscuit
taste
is
dominated
by
a
solid
malt
backbone
of
dry
caramelized
sugar
with
a
nice
biscuit
finish
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
brewed
though
it
doesnt
really
fall
close
to
a
particular
style
do
this
is
an
interesting
brown
ale
that
serves
as
grand
tetons
workhorse
dark
beer
its
combination
of
qualities
give
the
impression
of
a
blend
between
an
englishstyle
pale
ale
and
a
really
good
american
porter
it
is
fullflavored
and
obviously
wellcrafted
but
it
may
struggle
to
stand
out
amongst
their
strong
series
of
seasonal
offerings
and
oneoff
bottlings
biggest
flavor
right
off
the
bat
was
a
caramel
that
you
caught
right
up
front
along
with
a
burnt
or
roasted
wood
flavor
almost
had
a
touch
of
oaked
flavor
in
it
some
hoppiness
in
the
finish
but
nothing
distracting
from
the
primary
notes
a
good
solid
brown
ale
flavor
as
best
as
i
can
describe
it
finish
was
a
little
nutty
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
brings
down
what
started
very
well
still
worth
trying
but
i
would
rather
see
something
this
light
more
towards
5
percent
definitely
worth
a
try
but
more
for
curiosity
than
to
fulfill
your
brown
ale
fix
low
score
mainly
because
this
isnt
even
close
to
what
a
brown
is
it
tastes
decent
but
its
just
an
odd
combination
in
my
book
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
happily
drink
it
again
o
i
expected
a
blend
between
esb
and
brown
ale
and
ended
up
with
a
hoppy
brown
ale
think
a
slightly
subpar
dfh
indian
brown
ale
o
i
was
kinda
dissapointed
with
this
one
the
whole
extra
special
name
kinda
got
my
hopes
up
but
really
its
just
a
pretty
descent
brown
ale
i
do
like
how
the
hop
tastecreeps
up
in
the
aftertaste
that
was
kinda
special
drinkability
is
ok
not
outstanding
though
just
ok
on
the
take
home
scale
a
six
paxk
on
hand
for
all
occasions
o
decent
beer
pretty
attractive
aroma
a
bit
lacking
but
an
easy
drinking
beer
interesting
for
this
style
but
not
for
me
its
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
i
would
crave
or
desire
to
have
again
d
this
is
my
third
time
buying
bitch
creek
i
am
impressed
with
the
simplicity
and
taste
of
this
beer
i
find
this
a
staple
in
my
fridge
good
work
grand
teton
high
quality
brown
but
not
as
outstanding
as
other
browns
ive
had
in
the
past
paired
well
with
a
rich
lamb
burger
d
definitely
an
unusual
take
on
a
brown
ale
that
wont
always
appeal
to
fans
of
the
style
i
for
one
thought
it
was
very
drinkable
hazy
dark
and
brown
pour
solid
tan
head
that
builds
strong
then
sticks
around
aroma
is
thick
and
hoppy
like
an
ipa
or
apa
lots
of
citrus
pine
and
cocoa
in
the
nose
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
like
an
english
brown
ale
but
the
hops
and
bitterness
come
on
strong
and
fast
definitely
a
hopheads
brown
ale
it
gives
dogfish
heads
indian
brown
a
run
for
its
money
as
hoppiest
american
brown
ale
a
great
and
tasty
brew
d
this
one
is
heavy
a
meal
in
a
glass
for
me
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
even
though
it
is
only
6
abv
it
wears
it
on
its
sleeve
you
know
youre
drinking
alcohol
d
usually
hoppy
browns
are
not
my
style
but
this
is
going
down
pretty
easy
overall
a
great
surprise
from
a
beer
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
definitely
plan
on
buying
more
of
this
from
time
to
time
worth
a
shot
if
available
at
your
local
store
but
i
wouldnt
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
aromas
of
roasted
malt
caramel
and
citrus
hops
rich
toasted
caramel
malt
flavors
predominate
moderate
hop
bitterness
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
traces
of
semisweet
chocolate
and
cocoa
on
the
finish
artfully
balanced
between
roasted
malts
and
bitter
hops
full
flavored
and
complex
bitch
creek
is
one
bitchingly
sessionable
esb
just
a
tad
of
richness
and
a
slight
sharpness
to
the
hops
decrease
the
final
category
but
having
another
is
not
a
problem
it
is
decent
overall
good
stuff
for
a
brown
ale
i
would
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
even
though
it
isnt
normally
my
style
im
looking
forward
to
the
pursuit
of
hoppiness
a
gift
from
joshman
for
xmas
2010
poured
into
stemmed
glasses
from
the
bottle
the
color
was
dark
brown
with
a
medium
sized
head
smell
had
a
nice
aroma
of
dark
biscuits
taste
had
some
nice
flavors
of
fig
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
malt
the
problem
was
that
all
of
the
flavors
were
so
subtle
i
was
expecting
a
much
more
hearty
presentation
of
flavor
from
this
bottled
format
was
there
a
bit
of
oak
aging
here
i
got
just
a
slight
taste
of
it
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
drinkability
was
just
fine
for
a
brown
ale
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
nothing
earth
shattering
to
report
here
taste
starts
sweet
strong
citrus
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
grain
husk
malt
and
a
light
lemony
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
although
the
lemon
does
get
a
bit
dominant
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
interesting
brew
that
has
me
enjoying
at
one
sip
cursing
the
lemon
at
the
next
and
back
again
m
a
very
full
brown
ale
a
great
drinkability
that
makes
this
ale
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
fairly
harsh
the
mineralness
was
quite
strong
im
assuming
its
from
the
amount
of
hops
in
this
beer
not
a
fan
needs
to
be
simpler
the
body
is
medium
to
light
with
a
lightly
carbonated
chalky
feel
its
smooth
as
smooth
gets
the
light
hearted
body
makes
for
carefree
drinking
awesome
effort
here
serving
type
bottle
the
hops
caught
me
a
little
offguard
as
this
was
my
first
american
brown
it
grew
on
me
not
too
shabby
overall
maybe
this
was
towards
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
but
it
was
a
rather
underwhelming
brown
ale
i
have
been
pretty
impressed
by
grand
teton
but
this
did
not
do
much
for
me
there
are
much
better
browns
out
there
overall
this
was
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
it
was
a
step
above
what
i
expected
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
definitely
an
option
worth
consideration
d
not
incredibly
complex
but
taste
was
good
and
i
can
definitely
drink
lots
of
it
d
i
find
this
a
decent
beer
now
and
plan
to
review
again
in
the
future
i
know
have
enjoyed
on
subsequent
occassions
since
this
review
and
feel
as
thought
an
update
may
be
in
order
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
by
it
stands
up
well
in
its
own
category
of
brew
for
sure
overallnotes
so
i
must
plead
ignorance
here
i
did
some
quick
shopping
and
bought
this
thinking
it
was
an
extra
special
bitter
needless
to
say
i
was
caught
completely
offguard
when
i
drank
it
it
isnt
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
i
dont
think
its
quite
up
my
alley
dnot
the
most
drinkable
brown
but
i
didnt
have
any
problems
with
the
bottle
serving
type
bottle
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
one
enjoyable
and
drinkable
enough
very
light
for
a
brown
but
nothing
especially
noteworthy
for
me
good
but
not
too
memorable
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
to
a
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
grapefruity
hops
almost
ipa
like
in
the
taste
a
nice
citrus
to
pine
hop
and
a
nice
dry
malt
all
the
way
through
a
bitter
to
smooth
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
drysmall
citrus
hop
in
the
aftertaste
almost
an
ipa
but
i
can
dig
it
for
a
brown
ale
this
was
too
bitter
while
the
malt
profile
was
good
the
drynessbitterness
took
over
as
the
main
flavor
it
poured
nice
at
first
extremely
heady
and
looked
great
its
smell
was
weak
and
did
not
match
the
first
tastes
for
an
esb
this
was
not
soothing
although
if
your
a
fan
of
extra
hoppy
browns
this
may
be
for
you
served
with
a
nice
large
foamy
frothy
light
tan
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
brown
aroma
is
malt
n
hops
flavor
is
like
american
brown
pushing
the
limits
in
fact
maybe
too
far
too
me
the
hop
is
at
least
equal
to
the
malt
and
dominates
it
in
some
ways
that
crosses
it
over
into
some
other
beer
style
body
is
good
and
good
carbonation
but
the
jacked
up
bitterness
is
more
astringent
and
pucker
in
the
mouth
finish
is
a
little
on
the
sharp
side
but
still
overall
a
great
drinking
beer
just
a
little
outside
aba
oh
and
the
esb
moniker
needs
to
go
not
witty
or
clever
at
all
seems
to
me
a
cheesy
attempt
at
humor
or
marketing
guys
got
to
get
canned
conclusion
i
feel
that
this
take
on
the
style
missed
the
mark
i
dont
have
any
problem
with
hopping
up
a
style
that
usually
doesnt
display
major
hops
but
doing
so
at
the
expense
of
the
original
heart
and
soul
of
the
beer
ends
up
being
a
trade
off
without
benefits
if
the
hops
balanced
a
more
with
the
malts
this
could
be
beneficial
pours
a
nice
moderate
brown
color
with
some
copper
streaks
white
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
strong
and
nice
good
notes
of
pine
grapefruit
and
some
other
citrus
hops
light
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
nose
the
flavor
has
a
nice
hop
bouquet
along
with
a
bit
of
light
caramel
and
bread
pretty
good
body
with
a
nice
level
of
bitterness
and
a
good
finish
drinks
quite
well
and
was
a
solid
nice
first
beer
from
idaho
the
scent
is
punctuated
by
grapefruit
and
pine
hops
backed
up
and
balanced
by
caramel
malts
that
balance
is
lost
somewhat
in
the
taste
with
the
hops
bitterness
taking
over
but
thats
what
an
esb
is
all
about
its
supposed
to
be
overbalanced
in
favor
of
the
bitterness
hence
the
name
id
pan
any
other
style
for
that
excess
but
this
seems
just
about
right
for
the
style
and
will
satisfy
just
about
any
hophead
or
bitter
bitch
highly
drinkable
beer
but
a
little
heavy
for
a
session
beer
a
little
over
the
edge
for
what
i
would
consider
sessionable
bought
a
single
in
missouri
and
it
was
on
the
bottom
rack
with
all
the
other
lone
single
that
they
didnt
have
multiples
of
it
has
a
section
for
when
it
was
bottled
on
but
no
information
there
suspecting
that
it
is
a
bit
old
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
one
id
love
to
always
have
around
they
came
close
to
hitting
a
home
run
by
bringing
out
some
of
the
brown
ale
characteristics
a
little
more
they
wouldve
done
it
as
it
is
i
would
classify
it
as
a
delicious
extremely
unorthodox
ipa
d
an
excellent
beer
which
ill
be
having
more
of
4
note
6
0
and
54
ibus
per
bottle
drinks
appropriately
the
odd
title
extra
special
brown
is
fitting
here
its
a
bit
odd
but
nicely
complex
for
a
brown
overall
i
liked
the
beer
but
not
as
much
as
i
figured
i
would
the
bittering
hops
seems
a
little
over
the
top
for
the
style
a
little
less
bittering
hops
for
me
would
make
this
beer
taste
better
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
unique
beer
and
im
glad
i
bought
it
but
i
probably
will
not
buy
another
six
pack
of
it
drinkability
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
taste
but
decently
complex
and
goodtasting
bitch
creek
ends
up
being
a
quite
tasty
oldschool
microbrew
style
which
we
really
dig
if
you
are
looking
for
a
fullflavored
biggerbodied
session
beer
here
it
is
got
on
tap
in
a
sampler
at
the
burger
bar
in
vegas
and
was
impressed
enough
to
come
back
for
a
pint
advertised
as
a
brown
ale
but
definitely
has
the
feel
of
a
bitter
in
several
respects
beautiful
garnet
brown
color
surprisingly
thick
head
sticks
well
to
the
glass
maybe
not
the
best
pairing
with
their
complex
burgers
maybe
an
ipa
but
a
strong
showing
could
use
a
little
more
roast
but
this
is
still
a
decent
sessionable
brown
ale
faintly
bland
for
the
style
but
still
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
i
definitely
would
have
had
another
if
i
had
one
its
reasonably
good
but
not
great
by
any
means
and
certainly
not
my
kind
of
beer
this
is
a
more
bitter
style
of
brown
ale
perhaps
it
could
be
described
as
a
brown
ipa
a
great
combination
for
a
superior
beer
d
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
think
they
did
a
worthy
job
i
would
try
again
love
the
balance
the
pleasant
bitterness
and
the
finish
of
this
beer
one
of
my
goto
b
six
packs
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
its
affordable
and
comes
in
six
packs
which
is
nice
i
always
thought
it
only
came
in
bombers
until
i
saw
this
single
at
my
notsolocal
liquor
store
i
paid
1
60
for
the
beer
so
thats
not
that
bad
at
all
it
finishes
with
a
little
spicy
hop
flavor
some
more
earthy
and
herbal
hops
but
they
get
a
little
spicy
here
and
are
somewhat
bitter
but
not
heavy
bitterness
it
dries
a
bit
quite
a
bit
but
leaves
a
slight
sticky
sweetness
feel
some
lingering
malts
and
even
a
touch
of
minerality
it
has
a
slight
creamy
feel
to
it
at
this
point
as
well
drinks
well
tasty
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
came
in
with
no
expectations
no
history
with
grant
teton
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
will
drink
bitch
creek
again
without
a
doubt
overall
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
bitter
but
it
was
a
brown
so
i
rated
it
as
a
brown
and
it
still
wasnt
that
good
i
just
wasnt
very
happy
with
this
offering
not
to
drinkable
d
awesome
with
some
good
abv
and
great
flavors
final
notes
now
i
know
why
they
call
it
an
extra
special
brown
think
of
this
as
a
cross
between
an
actual
esb
and
a
brown
ale
rather
interesting
flavor
to
say
the
least
very
sessionable
and
easy
drinking
drinks
pretty
good
i
might
be
done
after
4
or
so
of
these
a
decent
session
beer
but
it
might
lay
a
little
heavy
in
the
stomach
after
awhile
a
great
tasteing
beer
non
the
less
and
if
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
a
hold
of
for
me
i
might
drink
it
more
not
really
distributed
in
my
regionwell
not
that
i
know
of
but
seriously
this
is
what
an
ideal
esb
made
in
the
traditional
english
style
should
taste
like
my
one
qualm
about
this
review
is
that
its
miscategorized
this
beer
is
not
at
all
a
brown
ale
but
an
esb
that
is
what
im
basing
my
review
upon
had
enough
hops
to
be
interesting
but
not
as
sharp
as
an
ipa
a
warmth
to
the
flavor
for
some
reason
the
carbonation
fascinated
me
large
bubbles
settled
into
a
soft
smooth
head
with
interesting
topographic
features
i
would
have
thought
this
beer
might
have
a
little
more
heft
but
it
was
an
interesting
try
d
a
decent
brew
a
cross
between
an
esb
with
some
extra
hop
bite
and
an
english
brown
ale
dark
brown
colored
body
very
big
khaki
colored
head
leaves
some
stickiness
on
the
glass
dark
malt
scent
almost
seems
more
like
a
brown
than
a
esb
dark
malt
front
some
bittering
hops
balancing
it
out
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
very
wet
drink
its
not
really
a
bad
beer
but
like
i
said
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
brown
ale
which
is
probably
my
least
favorite
style
out
of
the
commonly
found
styles
of
beer
drinkability
is
quite
average
especially
for
the
price
not
that
impressed
with
this
one
drinkability
not
a
true
esb
as
it
is
called
an
extra
special
brown
it
really
is
a
cross
between
an
english
brown
ale
and
some
kind
of
bitter
american
beer
i
would
call
it
an
american
brown
ale
quite
good
but
the
mixture
is
just
slightly
offputting
medium
bodied
resinous
and
properly
carbonated
another
nice
beer
from
grand
teton
brewing
one
very
dark
esb
dark
chestnut
color
that
i
cannot
see
through
two
fingers
of
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
not
much
for
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
a
lot
caramel
malt
slight
citrus
and
floral
notes
the
flavor
is
on
the
sweeter
side
a
lot
of
caramel
and
some
citrus
the
body
is
also
fuller
than
others
in
the
style
well
carbonated
quite
filling
a
bigger
esb
that
drinks
nicely
but
the
bigger
body
and
higher
abv
lowers
drinkability
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
tasty
beer
albeit
a
little
too
sticky
and
very
easy
to
drink
its
not
clear
despite
the
careful
pour
and
relatively
strong
and
quite
sticky
anyway
its
tasty
but
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
the
bitterness
doesnt
fit
that
well
with
my
perception
of
esb
the
flavor
doesnt
fit
that
well
with
brown
ale
finally
it
is
too
highly
carbonated
these
add
up
to
a
beer
that
isnt
particularly
drinkable
though
id
be
happy
to
sip
one
again
as
it
definitely
deserves
further
contemplation
my
current
preference
would
be
for
less
caramel
malt
flavor
little
lower
gravity
less
stickiness
lower
carb
and
if
any
was
used
perhaps
less
sulfate
or
whatever
is
accentuating
the
hop
bitterness
perhaps
it
is
just
the
hop
variety
the
current
version
reminds
me
of
a
homebrew
we
made
called
wtf
where
we
combined
many
many
different
things
and
made
a
unique
flavorful
but
not
particularly
drinkable
beer
overall
not
a
bad
little
beer
i
enjoyed
the
heavy
maltiness
more
than
i
would
have
predicted
maybe
because
it
was
paired
with
such
a
big
hop
hit
the
flavours
hung
around
for
a
pleasant
aftertaste
my
taste
buds
liked
it
but
i
couldnt
have
another
my
mission
was
only
just
starting
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beers
limited
bigger
brother
the
xx
bitch
creek
and
this
beer
is
similar
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
mahogany
a
nice
deep
color
full
of
promise
with
a
good
ecru
head
the
aroma
is
bright
and
hoppy
a
bit
more
floral
than
most
esbs
but
lots
of
mineral
hoppiness
too
theres
a
big
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
backbone
the
flavor
is
rather
bitter
and
a
bit
surprising
it
could
use
some
more
malty
sweetness
to
bring
out
more
depth
but
its
a
mild
complaint
if
i
recall
correctly
the
xx
version
had
that
depth
and
it
was
quite
successful
the
beer
has
a
fairly
creamy
feel
probably
better
on
tap
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
the
style
and
dont
mind
a
bit
of
american
innovation
d
moderate
interesting
and
enjoyable
id
revisit
it
would
prob
pair
well
with
food
lots
of
interesting
flavors
going
on
mouthfeel
i
liked
the
beer
more
as
i
got
used
to
it
settled
down
picked
up
more
bitter
feel
but
still
a
little
heavier
than
i
like
my
esb
decent
price
just
kind
of
one
of
those
middle
of
the
road
beers
pours
a
brown
slightly
hazy
color
with
a
tan
head
i
smell
fruit
toffee
caramel
some
biscuit
notes
some
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
hops
and
malt
a
little
bitter
with
some
toffee
and
malt
some
fig
and
brown
sugar
the
mouth
feel
is
robust
like
a
brown
ale
maybe
its
ok
drinkable
its
just
not
my
style
or
one
that
ill
buy
i
will
say
try
it
if
you
like
browns
esb
or
wee
heavys
you
might
like
this
one
worth
a
try
overall
a
solid
effort
from
idaho
the
6
5
may
make
it
hard
to
session
but
im
willing
to
try
d
not
to
drinkable
in
my
opinion
maybe
12
pints
with
an
appetizer
not
too
much
balance
for
me
i
would
of
liked
more
malts
in
both
aroma
flavor
there
was
this
sharp
citrus
that
sorta
cut
through
anything
in
its
path
gets
a
little
better
when
warmed
but
still
not
great
in
my
opinion
i
would
recommend
looking
for
something
i
know
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
adequate
carbonation
a
good
beer
with
the
perfect
taste
in
my
opinion
for
its
style
d
bitch
creek
esb
is
a
good
beer
but
there
were
certain
things
about
it
i
just
couldnt
get
past
its
worth
trying
though
it
may
look
scary
with
all
that
sediment
but
after
that
you
get
yourself
into
a
good
esb
well
done
drinkability
id
have
this
one
again
for
sure
just
be
careful
as
its
6
5
abv
will
not
make
it
a
session
beer
but
if
youve
had
a
hard
day
at
the
office
this
one
will
feel
real
nice
going
down

esb
is
a
much
better
esb
just
saying
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
at
6
5
its
a
little
too
strong
to
be
a
session
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
i
think
its
a
little
too
hoppy
for
an
esb
but
its
tasty
enough
that
i
would
drink
this
again
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
creamy
beige
head
aroma
is
big
i
mean
like
barleywine
big
esb
my
ass
smells
like
caramel
and
toffee
and
citrus
hops
and
earth
and
fruitcake
flavor
is
equally
robust
earthy
and
sweet
malts
blend
with
candied
orange
and
grapefruit
hops
dusted
with
cocoa
powder
and
lead
into
a
bready
bitter
finish
54
ibus
seems
too
low
for
what
im
tasting
mouthfeel
joins
every
other
aspect
of
this
beer
in
being
nottostyle
as
the
heaviness
on
the
palate
detracts
from
the
expected
drinkability
of
an
esb
so
does
a
dose
of
astringency
im
pretty
perplexed
by
this
beer
on
ba
its
a
brown
ale
and
has
won
several
awards
in
gabf
under
that
category
and
on
rb
and
the
label
its
an
esb
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
either
india
brown
ale
unimperial
barleywine
whatever
its
pretty
good
pours
deep
mahogany
with
a
white
head
darker
than
most
esbs
ive
had
the
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
a
faint
white
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
earthy
english
hops
and
a
bit
of
roasted
caramel
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
rich
maltiness
up
front
and
then
a
bitterness
kick
at
the
end
the
yeast
seems
to
be
american
and
not
english
it
imparts
a
more
fruity
taste
than
bready
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
which
i
prefer
with
this
style
overall
pretty
drinkable
and
nice
american
interpretation
of
the
esb
bold
and
fullbodied
on
the
palate
opening
with
flavors
of
coffee
herbal
hops
toffee
pine
and
orange
peel
wellhopped
but
balanced
by
a
substantial
malt
backbone
nutty
biscuitlike
finish
with
herbal
hop
bitterness
drinks
easy
despite
the
full
body
and
rich
flavor
very
good
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
there
is
a
lighter
red
along
the
edges
and
bottom
of
the
glass
also
there
is
suspended
sediment
evident
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
sweet
malt
and
slight
caramel
fits
the
style
of
an
esb
not
quite
sure
why
it
is
called
a
brown
on
this
site
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slight
creamy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
it
is
also
fairly
bitter
tastes
of
pale
hops
strong
hops
slight
roasted
malt
slight
citrus
and
some
sweet
malt
overall
one
of
the
better
esbs
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
theres
a
great
balance
of
ingredients
good
body
good
aroma
and
easy
drinkability
surprisingly
robust
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
on
this
one
i
can
say
its
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
style
a
nice
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
look
to
for
sessioning
notes
despite
what
this
beer
is
rated
if
youre
a
fan
of
big
bold
beers
dont
pass
this
one
up
this
is
brown
ale
is
fantastic
d
this
beer
has
a
great
rich
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
fizzy
and
hop
finish
that
cleans
up
the
beer
there
is
good
depth
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
cask
this
is
a
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
its
all
over
the
board
with
hop
and
malt
flavors
the
aroma
starts
with
lemon
and
floral
grapefruit
with
dark
bread
crust
and
caramel
in
the
background
the
flavor
get
a
whole
lot
earthier
with
leather
and
herbal
chocolate
with
graham
crackers
upfront
the
hops
enter
with
more
lemon
citrus
and
grapefruit
that
soon
turns
to
fruit
rind
and
bitter
flowers
this
is
clearly
a
complex
beer
and
worthy
of
consideration
doh
so
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
and
i
could
see
myself
having
several
on
a
sitting
mouth
is
heavy
for
a
esb
and
incredibly
well
carbonated
drinks
well
but
not
too
fast
because
of
the
abv
whoa
good
it
has
a
dark
body
and
a
rocky
dark
tan
head
there
is
a
lot
of
sediment
in
the
body
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
malt
there
was
a
little
bit
of
a
chemical
like
aroma
too
i
thinking
maybe
i
have
a
bad
bottle
i
am
going
to
rate
it
anyway
but
i
want
to
try
this
one
again
the
flavor
is
very
toffee
and
coffee
like
it
is
pretty
bitter
it
reminds
me
of
more
of
a
porter
i
like
the
flavor
creamy
mouthfeel
with
good
amount
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
to
it
but
not
overpowering
pretty
good
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
drinkable
yeah
sure
there
wasnt
anything
memorable
about
this
but
it
wasnt
a
bad
choice
for
the
warm
weather
either
i
wish
that
were
more
beers
of
this
style
brewed
here
in
the
states
but
this
is
a
good
launching
point
nevertheless
just
dont
know
when
ill
get
back
out
to
bitch
creek
again
medium
bodied
smooth
and
very
drinkable
notes
bbcsd0907sean
overall
i
like
the
complexity
of
this
beer
and
would
drink
again
if
i
have
the
chance
try
it
out
with
an
open
mind
d
very
drinkable
especially
in
colder
weather
a
perfect
compliment
to
mn
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
good
character
very
much
worth
trying
d
overall
this
is
one
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
beer
if
was
available
around
me
it
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
of
beers
worth
trying
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
rusty
brownish
red
the
head
is
plentiful
and
a
creamy
beige
color
a
nice
ring
of
lace
is
left
behind
after
the
head
slowy
recedes
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
malt
and
hops
the
hops
are
much
more
aggresive
of
the
two
but
not
overdone
theres
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
is
slightly
piney
with
a
bit
of
sour
fruit
and
a
bread
like
maltiness
in
the
finish
seems
kind
of
funny
to
have
bitter
in
the
name
when
the
beer
isnt
really
bitter
medium
body
not
much
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
the
style
is
still
a
bit
of
a
mystery
to
me
i
will
have
to
try
a
few
more
esb
beers
to
get
a
handle
on
them
drinkability
very
drinkable
could
easily
do
a
session
with
this
one
especially
in
fall
or
winter
love
the
complex
flavors
in
this
one
a
beautiful
example
of
the
esb
style
easily
my
favorite
of
the
grand
teton
beers
ive
tried
but
the
sweetgrass
ipa
is
nice
too
this
is
a
great
esb
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
grand
teton
did
it
right
i
enjoyed
this
with
lunch
at
yelloystone
national
park
highly
recommended
my
first
sip
was
all
bitter
tasting
it
grabbed
my
tongue
and
held
tight
but
as
i
sipped
more
the
more
flavors
came
out
there
is
actually
a
lot
of
completxity
and
big
flavors
to
be
had
here
once
you
get
past
the
initial
bitter
shock
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
when
first
poured
the
head
of
the
beer
was
decent
not
to
ambitious
sedimentation
is
present
when
pouring
the
last
of
the
beer
out
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
great
floweral
hoppy
and
coriander
is
present
the
taste
of
the
beer
good
bitterness
a
hoppy
sweetness
to
the
tastebuds
overall
a
really
great
beer
the
body
was
good
typical
for
the
style
the
drinkability
was
good
as
well
overall
a
solidly
decent
beer
that
if
it
were
more
regularly
available
to
me
id
mix
into
my
regular
rotation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
the
first
esb
ive
reviewed
you
get
the
best
of
both
worlds
if
youre
a
maltlover
or
hophead
di
love
this
beer
ill
have
to
reach
for
it
more
frequently
smooth
and
easy
whle
also
a
little
bit
different
dthis
is
a
pretty
big
esb
i
was
surprised
with
the
color
and
the
profile
overall
an
esb
to
savor
and
enjoy
rather
than
to
session
with
dgood
beer
sessionable
and
enjoyable
blipped
lifes
a
bitch
by
motorhead
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
definite
session
beer
nice
esb
that
is
worth
trying
d
the
extremes
of
this
beer
make
it
less
drinkable
for
the
average
beer
drinker
but
extreme
beer
lovers
with
love
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
the
best
on
my
yellowstonegrand
tetonslc
trip
a
great
take
on
an
esb
from
grand
teton
at
first
i
was
concerned
this
beer
was
just
a
mediocre
brew
with
a
catchy
name
but
then
i
tasted
it
this
is
my
favorite
esb
right
now
all
in
all
a
good
drinkable
esp
this
could
use
a
little
more
body
though
still
a
beer
worth
trying
and
quite
sessionable
this
beer
was
a
nice
surprise
and
one
id
have
again
this
beer
was
a
gift
from
a
friend
who
had
been
to
idaho
im
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
esbs
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
dark
brown
with
nice
creamy
head
bottle
poured
into
imperial
pint
glass
excellent
lacing
smells
malty
earthy
taste
reminds
me
of
a
brown
but
with
somewhat
of
a
bitter
finish
really
not
what
i
expected
from
an
esb
mouthfeel
was
heavy
again
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
esb
drinkability
diminished
because
it
is
very
heavy
cant
see
finishing
two
pours
a
clear
red
with
a
nice
foamy
medium
beige
head
aroma
is
light
malt
with
a
little
orange
hop
flavor
is
initially
quite
malty
followed
by
a
blast
of
bitter
hops
the
finish
is
long
and
kind
of
bready
quite
drinkable
and
a
decent
example
of
an
esb
d
good
and
tasty
still
pissed
about
the
pour
though
it
was
an
absolute
mess
d
good
but
needs
to
be
creamier
the
color
is
a
little
dark
and
the
alcohol
content
is
high
for
the
style
d
this
was
my
first
grand
teton
and
though
it
was
heavy
for
an
esb
it
was
a
damn
good
ale
i
would
now
like
to
try
many
other
grand
teton
beers
as
well
as
have
some
more
of
this
one
drinkability
my
first
beer
from
grand
teton
and
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
have
never
seen
a
beer
with
such
a
resinous
sticky
head
and
lacing
pours
amber
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
some
retention
and
very
nice
laceing
aroma
is
bready
with
hints
of
carmel
body
is
lighter
than
i
expected
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
breadyand
malty
with
some
hops
in
the
finish
very
good
stuff
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
complex
malt
scent
that
screams
burnt
toffee
and
bisquits
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
crystal
malt
and
hops
taste
thats
mildly
bitter
and
a
bit
thin
in
the
finish
the
aroma
suggests
a
heavier
warmer
beer
but
it
doesnt
carry
over
to
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinker
its
complex
yet
thin
and
easily
quaffable
excellent
brew
i
havent
had
an
esb
yet
that
could
hold
a
candle
to
it
but
now
im
going
to
have
to
start
looking
harder
poured
a
weird
orangebrown
red
with
a
non
existent
head
aroma
is
of
strong
of
hay
and
rabbit
pellets
im
glad
this
doesnt
taste
how
it
smells
flavor
is
of
earthy
bitter
hops
and
weirdness
feel
is
tingly
from
the
carbonation
the
oddness
of
this
beer
will
prevent
me
from
ever
buying
another
there
are
much
better
esbs
out
there
d
goes
down
really
easy
would
love
this
on
a
summer
night
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
enjoyed
this
beer
m
d
soft
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
tingling
carbonation
noted
later
in
the
mouth
medium
body
easier
drinking
not
bad
at
all
and
id
be
happy
to
try
it
again
d
very
drinkable
esb
well
balanced
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
one
of
the
nicest
esbs
out
there
thanks
donkeyrunner
plain
and
simple
the
best
esb
ive
ever
had
very
complex
and
flavorful
but
still
retains
subtlety
that
is
characteristic
of
style
d
not
quite
a
session
beer
however
the
alcohol
is
very
well
camoflauged
very
very
tasty
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
esb
after
having
fullers
esb
last
night
i
have
to
say
this
one
lies
between
that
and
an
american
ipapale
ale
still
a
nice
beer
that
shows
off
some
caramel
malts
and
a
nice
mixture
of
bitter
and
flavorful
hops
certainly
more
aggressive
in
the
bitterness
department
than
its
english
counterparts
this
was
ok
but
at
a
place
like
romans
it
wouldnt
be
in
the
first
5
beers
id
recommend
medium
bodied
lightly
lingering
finish
tasty
stuff
id
drink
one
againfor
sure
flows
well
with
mild
bubbles
and
nice
finish
i
could
probably
drink
another
2
or
5
of
these
because
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
quality
to
it
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
d
drinks
really
easy
with
malts
hops
and
carbonation
in
pleasing
balance
might
be
a
bit
stronger
than
al
lot
of
esbs
but
very
tasty
fairly
drinkable
beer
something
i
enjoyed
trying
for
sure
for
the
style
i
consider
it
very
drinkable
this
is
the
second
esb
ive
tried
this
week
i
wasnt
expecting
much
in
the
way
of
drinkability
but
i
was
surprised
on
both
accounts
craft
beer
from
idaho
why
not
d
goes
down
smooth
for
being
as
hoppy
as
it
is
very
drinkable

d
on
the
hoppy
side
tasty
goes
down
easy
drinkability
a
solid
esb
a
little
strange
in
places
but
interesting
nonetheless
alcohol
may
be
a
little
high
for
the
style
but
it
doesnt
really
matter
the
spiciness
of
this
one
gives
it
a
unique
twist
thats
worth
it
give
this
one
a
shot
idaho
done
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
makes
for
an
okay
session
a
little
stronger
than
most
esbs
but
still
tasty
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
revist
to
a
beer
i
used
to
hate
still
not
crazy
about
it
but
it
is
growing
on
me
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
a
very
good
esb
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
daily
sippers
i
am
glad
i
have
access
to
this
beer
d
what
a
pleasant
beer
great
flavors
balanced
nicely
i
could
drink
like
18
of

really
more
of
an
american

on
the
esb

for
a
second
jk
a
very
nice
beer
and
the

this
is
a

drinkable
very
sessionable
esb
a
little
more

a
very

for

lovers

that

ibus
does
as
much
for
you
as
it
does
for
me
d
slightly
higher
than
average
abv
but
overall
a
good
tasting
esb
with
a
nice
nutty
aftertaste
wow
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
an
esb
this
was
really
good
its
a
style
ive
have
to
look
into
revisiting
more
often
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
drinks
good
you
must
not
crave
extreme
hops
for
hate
dark
fruit
though
an
okay
esb
certainly
an
american
frankenstein
on
the
style
a
good
enough
drinker
though
its
so
full
and
thick
that
it
goes
down
slow
d
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
so
much
im
not
hopaverse
by
any
means
but
i
do
like
more
balance
in
an
esb
than
this
one
offered
also
its
6
5
abv
raises
it
above
being
sessionable
i
e
even
if
i
really
liked
this
one
i
couldnt
go
for
more
than
a
couple
at
a
sitting
may
give
it
another
try
somewhere
down
the
road
if
you
love
the
hop
though
youll
be
well
satisfied
and
you
gotta
love
the
name
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
and
has
some
good
caramel
tones
to
it
you
get
a
very
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
not
much
in
the
mouth
it
is
light
and
carbonation
is
pretty
low
overall
a
nice
beer
but
i
will
have
to
stick
with
the
brutal
very
nice
and
smooth
yet
with
more
character
than
most
esbs
ive
had
and
much
more
memorable
a
very
tasty
and
different
ale
this
is
my
first
grand
teton
experience
and
its
been
a
good
one
i
honestly
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
an
esb
crafted
in
idaho
but
its
good
the
nose
could
stand
some
work
other
than
that
its
a
fine
effort
its
a
little
left
of
center
from
most
esbs
out
there
and
im
a
fan
d
nice
as
a
session
beer
or
with
food
poured
into
a
snifter
nice
amber
color
with
some
ruby
hints
tan
head
on
top
with
a
nice
retention
level
bitch
creek
has
a
bitter
hoppy
aroma
which
smells
like
kent
goldings
along
with
this
is
slightly
sweet
apple
aroma
from
the
malts
as
for
taste
very
nice
malt
backbone
followed
by
some
great
mild
bitters
from
the
hops
some
apple
flavors
but
mostly
just
a
wellbalance
of
english
hops
and
crystal
malts
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
damn
near
perfect
for
this
style
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
very
nice
drinking
esb
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
d
i
like
it
i
would
say
its
growing
on
me
my
initial
impression
was
just
another
esb
but
i
now
feel
it
is
solidly
above
average
nice
hop
kick
the
malt
and
hops
pair
well
together
highly
drinkable
d
it
was
a
pleasant
brew
that
was
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
anticipated
but
reasonably
well
balanced
and
a
pleasure
to
sample
i
could
easily
see
spending
some
time
drinking
this
brew
i
dont
know
how
well
this
fit
the
style
but
it
was
interesting
enough
to
be
enjoyed
worth
a
try
this
beer
continues
to
grow
on
me
as
i
drink
i
dont
visit
this
style
too
often
and
truthfully
im
not
sure
why
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
would
make
a
great
quaffer
if
the
abv
wasnt
so
high
the
6
5
is
unnoticeable
edit
as
it
warms
it
is
really
reminding
me
of
recent
tasting
of
stones
8th
anniversary
an
aged
imperial
mild
simply
very
good
and
very
balanced
pours
a
dark
ruby
amber
with
a
nice
tan
two
finger
head
that
slowly
dies
down
stickiness
is
great
very
full
all
over
the
sides
smell
is
a
big
caramel
malt
with
an
earthy
hop
mix
great
nose
for
this
style
very
inviting
taste
is
quite
bready
with
good
malt
flavors
of
caramel
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
licorice
could
use
some
more
hop
flavor
but
pretty
good
balance
overall
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
for
this
style
im
liking
it
carbonation
is
fairly
mild
as
well
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
brew
i
really
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
i
have
the
waxed
fliptop
maibock
waiting
for
a
special
occasion
thanks
again
dan
tangy
with
shades
of
an
oily
finish
this
was
a
great
way
to
start
off
the
2007
nfl
season
this
would
be
a
great
six
pack
afternoon
sipper
d
a
great
esb
came
right
out
of
left
field
i
never
had
anything
from
this
brewery
before
so
i
continue
to
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
brews
in
the
future
thanks
to
hitimes
for
finally
having
some
of
their
brews
in
single
bottles
so
i
can
try
them
a
great
find
if
you
are
in
the
west
reviewed
from
notes
this
is
a
stellar
brew
i
always
wondered
about
this
style
i
used
to
feel
that
pale
ales
and
ipas
really
covered
the
necessary
requirement
for
these
beers
and
that
esbs
just
blended
in
either
way
boy
was
i
wrong
this
esb
is
definitely
hoppier
than
a
pale
ale
and
has
much
better
malt
background
than
most
ipas
furthermore
it
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
fluffy
two
inch
head
i
had
this
about
a
year
ago
at
a
friends
house
in
denver
but
couldnt
find
it
here
in
the
springs
i
finally
was
able
to
acquire
a
handful
and
will
savor
each
and
every
one
mouthfeel
is
a
solid
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
bitter
slightly
drying
finish
thanks
to
boolshot
for
this
bottle
i
would
grab
this
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
smooth
easy
drinker
a
delicious
esb
and
one
that
should
not
be
missed
mediumfull
body
fairly
low
carbonation
coats
as
it
goes
down
but
not
syrupy
balance
is
good
even
though
both
malt
hops
are
very
prominent
neither
overpowers
the
other
id
rate
drinkability
as
good
and
could
easily
see
downing
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
from
boolshot
for
my
anny
bombing
other
notes
nothing
wrong
with
it
really
i
am
having
it
again
as
i
write
this
review
and
i
shall
have
it
again
it
has
a
body
that
is
toward
the
medium
side
of
things
drinkability
very
quaffable
and
highly
refreshing
but
after
a
couple
im
ready
for
something
different
drinkability
very
good
a
very
abv
to
give
you
the
opportunity
to
drink
more
normal
got
a
very
pleasent
taste
and
a
lightness
to
it
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
surprise
i
usually
dont
like
esbs
but
this
is
a
lot
fruitier
with
the
west
coast
hops
its
more
like
a
weak
barleywine
or
arrogant
bastard
bright
citrusy
floral
leafy
grassy
piney
and
metallic
hops
leap
out
at
you
in
bitch
creeks
esb
almost
challenging
you
to
take
a
sip
theres
also
some
berrylike
yeasty
fruitiness
and
some
mild
chocolate
and
dark
caramel
malt
underneath
giving
it
quite
a
round
and
welcoming
nose
the
body
is
medium
and
its
delicate
median
carbonation
caresses
the
tastebuds
the
deep
chestnut
body
has
a
crimson
and
ruby
cast
thats
reminiscent
of
old
polished
leather
furniture
and
the
creamy
tan
head
holds
long
enough
to
make
an
impression
and
then
continues
to
leave
walls
of
spotty
lace
once
its
dropped
rich
caramelized
sugars
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
dominate
the
malty
side
of
the
flavor
juicy
yeasty
fruitiness
livens
it
apples
red
berries
prunes
pear
and
citrusy
leafy
grassy
mineralish
floral
and
subtly
pineyminty
hops
round
it
out
with
a
raspy
edge
a
bold
bitterness
anchors
it
but
theres
enough
girth
to
the
maltiness
that
it
doesnt
appear
as
bitter
it
finishes
drying
as
the
sweetish
and
distinctly
caramelish
maltiness
fades
and
the
piney
and
resinous
hops
rise
both
softened
along
the
way
by
a
soft
smooth
cushion
of
underlying
orangelike
citrus
nice
good
drinkability
really
nothing
turns
me
off
about
this
beer
its
pretty
straightforward
and
easy
to
put
down
d
not
what
i
expected
from
an
esb
but
the
bitterness
showed
after
i
drank
more
most
enjoyable
one
ive
had
from
grand
teton
and
it
would
make
for
an
excellent
session
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
dark
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
awhile
nice
islands
and
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
brew
the
scent
is
malty
hoppy
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweetmalty
with
a
very
nice
bittercaramel
finish
medium
body
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
esb
one
of
the
best
ive
had
highly
recommended
12oz
bottle
poured
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
large
off
white
head
that
stuck
to
the
glass
big
caramel
malt
aroma
lots
of
malt
in
the
taste
some
caramel
and
burntroasted
flavors
also
with
a
bit
of
a
watery
taste
and
old
stale
hop
presence
in
the
back
ground
mouth
feel
like
the
taste
seems
thin
and
watery
this
one
is
so
thin
it
goes
down
easy
but
the
stale
hop
taste
is
not
pleasing
and
kills
the
drink
ability
esb
means
extra
special
bitter
and
bitter
is
what
bitch
creek
is
all
about
nice
coppery
color
and
a
subtle
aroma
waft
up
from
the
glass
low
head
and
moderate
carbonation
are
to
style
the
bitterness
is
a
little
pronounced
even
a
little
astringent
the
brewers
may
want
to
spend
a
week
in
london
putting
back
a
few
real
pints
of
the
bitter
to
see
what
the
taste
is
all
about
beer
poured
a
nice
looking
deep
ruby
red
but
had
no
head
nose
is
nice
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
taste
is
a
wonderful
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
citrusy
hops
mouthfeel
is
lively
on
the
palate
with
a
medium
to
full
body
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
american
esb
style
a
friend
gave
me
this
i
was
wary
since
he
said
it
tasted
metallic
and
i
dislike
metallic
tasting
beers
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
though
the
bitterness
came
through
more
like
tea
than
metal
so
it
was
pretty
good
pours
dark
translucent
mahogany
reminds
me
of
coke
no
head
not
lacing
lightly
carbonated
almost
looks
flat
smell
consists
of
slightly
sweet
caramel
malts
but
is
overpowered
by
stinky
hops
and
alcohols
taste
isnt
as
gross
as
i
would
have
expected
from
the
smell
surprisingly
balanced
compared
to
the
nose
again
light
caramels
not
very
malty
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
and
some
alcohol
peeking
through
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
watered
down
stout
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
would
have
thought
2004
gabf
gold
american
brown
ale
great
drinkability
excellent
example
of
the
style
d
yeah
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
esb
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
dont
know
this
brewer
although
ive
seen
several
offerings
at
bevmo
but
you
know
what
this
is
one
of
the
better
esbs
ive
ever
had
a
nice
cloudy
redclay
brown
with
a
small
but
decent
head
with
aromas
of
slightly
sweet
roasty
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
bitter
but
the
flavor
retains
these
nice
aromas
with
a
solid
but
not
overwhelming
hop
bite
that
really
brings
it
all
together
i
really
like
this
one
glad
i
got
a
sixer
i
may
need
to
get
some
more
looks
like
flat
coke
with
a
hint
of
red
when
it
pours
not
very
appetizing
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
quite
good
perfect
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
some
nice
fruity
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
but
that
only
detracts
the
slightest
bit
a
very
quaffable
esb
that
i
would
enjoy
having
the
pleasure
to
sip
throughout
the
day
doesnt
fit
the
style
guidelines
strictly
but
it
is
very
good
deep
brown
in
color
but
with
some
attactive
ruby
highlights
large
frothy
cream
colored
head
forms
drops
a
bit
but
sits
on
top
pretty
well
caramel
malty
aroma
with
resinousearthy
hops
in
the
taste
the
hops
are
quite
resinous
as
well
piney
and
flora
with
just
a
little
lingering
citrus
there
is
a
crisp
sweetness
from
the
malt
crystal
andor
red
malt
flavors
some
apple
like
sweetness
as
well
pretty
darn
good
esb
d
tasty
easytodrink
not
very
filling
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
this
style
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
but
this
particular
beer
is
one
of
the
better
esbs
that
ive
had
may
be
my
favorite
of
esbs
very
bright
and
clean
tasting
with
great
drinkability
and
some
incredible
complexity
for
this
style
revisiting
this
one
after
several
months
just
makes
it
better
thanks
to
bitterbill
for
this
one
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
really
nice
thick
creamy
tan
head
the
nose
has
lots
of
floral
bitter
hops
but
a
good
amount
of
malt
too
i
pick
up
a
litle
caramel
as
well
on
a
last
sniff
there
is
plenty
of
those
hops
when
i
take
my
first
taste
theres
some
balance
provided
by
some
nicely
roasted
maly
again
a
little
caramel
the
beer
itslef
is
a
little
mouth
heavy
along
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
makes
this
too
big
for
an
all
night
type
of
beer
but
it
is
otherwise
really
enjoyable
pours
with
a
tannish
yellow
head
that
is
fluffy
thick
like
the
top
of
clouds
and
fell
with
a
solid
lace
this
a
clear
american
interpretation
of
the
british
style
seemingly
doubling
up
on
the
malt
and
hops
very
solid
hop
smell
but
balance
by
an
equally
strong
malt
presence
full
of
fruity
estersraison
and
caramel
along
with
the
citrusy
hop
character
thick
mouthfeel
makes
is
very
fun
to
drink
though
clearly
overhopped
for
an
esbdont
try
to
turn
a
macro
drinker
on
this
one
give
him
a
redhook
d
good
stuff
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
bottle
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
a
onefinger
head
fine
streams
of
small
bubbles
and
some
lacing
aroma
was
mild
caramel
and
toffee
and
a
barely
noticible
hop
aroma
taste
was
primarily
caramel
malt
with
some
hop
flavor
it
was
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
for
picking
this
up
for
me
while
on
his
travels
i
found
it
to
be
a
pleasurable
experience
and
will
refer
to
it
the
next
time
i
pick
up
an
esb
thanks
to
bditty187
for
this
one
its
just
as
good
as
you
said
it
was
pours
a
nice
copper
red
hue
with
medium
crown
it
is
a
little
bit
hazy
with
a
few
rising
streams
of
bubbles
head
retention
is
average
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
is
good
with
a
bit
of
malt
at
the
front
and
a
nice
hoppy
finish
to
balance
it
out
quite
nicely
this
also
gives
the
beer
a
nice
layering
effect
its
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
i
would
definately
drink
more
but
unfortunately
i
only
have
one
a
super
quaffable
i
think
this
leans
towards
an
english
style
esb
with
american
style
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
one
of
the
best
esbs
ive
had
this
is
extremely
drinkable
again
screw
the
style
i
could
buy
a
sixpack
and
go
to
town
i
bet
this
would
be
great
with
burgers
or
any
grilled
meat
oh
my
i
just
thought
how
great
this
would
be
on
cask
lordy
anyway
i
sought
out
this
beer
because
i
wanted
to
crossoff
idaho
from
my
must
try
a
beer
from
all
50
states
list

i
did
but
this
beer
is
more
memorable
than
that
this
is
really
good
thank
you
bitterbill
taste
was
similar
nice
balance
the
citrus
cuts
the
chocolate
apart
so
that
the
thickness
is
clean
remains
a
bit
thin
however
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
region
good
beer
great
with
italian
food
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
and
hits
my
taste
buds
just
right
sweet
caramel
tones
in
the
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
with
the
hops
good
stuff
the
carbonation
is
light
which
is
expected
also
there
was
a
medium
body
that
blended
well
good
beer
i
should
make
a
clone
of
this
beer
and
call
it
son
of
a
bitch
otherwise
a
good
standby
beer
with
an
interesting
hop
character
go
try
it
at
least
once
one
inch
of
dense
tan
head
leaves
lots
of
small
sticky
spots
the
beer
is
clear
dark
red
nice
sweet
pruney
aroma
tangy
with
dark
malt
almost
a
little
barleywineish
tangy
and
chocolatey
in
front
rich
thick
big
chocolate
malt
in
the
middle
with
a
fruity
bitter
chocolate
finish
overall
tasty
with
very
dark
malt
and
bitter
chocolate
but
i
dont
really
get
the
esb
out
of
this
more
like
a
chocolate
brown
ale
i
gotta
admit
i
didnt
expect
a
brew
quite
this
good
id
never
sampled
anything
from
this
brewery
before
tonight
and
i
just
had
the
sweetgrass
ipa
followed
by
this
impressive
brew
theyve
left
quite
the
good
impression
glad
my
local
store
is
going
to
have
this
on
stock
from
now
on
well
worth
trying
if
you
find
it
this
beer
pours
a
brownish
red
with
a
tan
head
the
head
fades
slowly
leaving
thick
laces
this
beer
smells
piney
the
hop
aroma
is
strong
but
not
overwhelming
behind
the
piney
slightly
floral
aroma
i
detect
some
caramel
malty
aromas
this
beer
does
not
taste
as
hoppy
as
the
aroma
leads
you
to
believe
it
is
actually
rather
malty
the
hop
flavor
is
there
but
just
not
the
strongest
the
blend
of
hops
and
malts
balance
quite
nicely
it
has
slight
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavors
also
this
beer
is
carbonated
quite
nicely
it
goes
down
smooth
leaving
a
sweet
but
also
hoppy
aftertaste
i
think
this
beer
would
make
a
great
session
beer
it
is
not
too
high
in
alcohol
and
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
mild
i
am
glad
that
this
beer
has
recently
been
made
available
to
my
area
i
will
more
than
likely
buy
this
one
again
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
overall
a
solid
thumbs
up
cant
wait
to
try
another
from
this
brewer
dark
singed
amber
body
with
a
small
yet
persistent
guaze
of
light
brown
head
darker
than
expected
and
looks
great
nose
is
quite
malty
with
sticky
brown
sugar
and
a
whiff
of
cotton
candy
mixed
with
toffee
fresh
hop
aromas
back
it
up
slightly
citrusy
but
mostly
resinous
and
herbal
toasted
malt
flavors
up
front
sweetish
toffee
makes
a
fleeting
appearance
midpalate
followed
by
swelling
hops
bitter
herbal
resinous
and
slightly
minty
oh
and
delicious
medium
bodied
with
a
minerally
to
slightly
creamy
feel
a
big
esb
in
the
vein
of
belks
nice
this
bitch
creek
ale
was
a
pleasant
surprise
when
poured
in
the
glass
it
was
an
amber
color
with
very
little
foam
the
smell
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
filled
the
nose
with
a
very
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
was
very
evident
with
a
hint
of
a
caramel
flavor
like
i
said
what
a
pleasant
surprise
this
ale
was
watch
out
here
i
come
for
a
case
next
purchase
the
taste
was
also
predominantly
malted
though
it
was
complimented
but
a
robust
bitterness
perfect
for
a
summer
afternoon
there
was
a
slight
sweetness
to
the
beer
but
most
of
the
profile
was
of
older
thicker
malt
flavors
the
malt
also
imparted
a
slightly
sour
astringent
youd
get
with
an
amber
and
complimented
by
the
bitterness
it
had
a
crisp
flavor
decent
beer
though
and
an
odd
option
in
san
francisco
overall
impression
this
is
a
bit
bigger
than
many
of
the
esbs
i
have
tried
before
but
it
is
very
well
done
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
could
be
dangerous
with
the
relatively
high
abv
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
nice
name
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
this
one
this
one
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
as
it
should
be
but
i
think
they
used
american
hops
in
here
flavor
is
right
on
slightly
strong
bitter
with
a
good
malt
backing
to
balance
out
the
flavors
drinkability
is
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
right
on
good
brew
this
one
was
brought
back
from
idaho
on
a
trip
a
few
months
back
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
rubied
brown
color
a
bit
too
dark
for
my
liking
much
darker
than
expected
the
nose
is
mostly
grapefruity
hop
with
some
dirty
hops
playing
in
the
background
as
well
i
think
it
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
a
nice
burst
of
citrus
hop
followed
with
a
touch
of
caramel
finishing
with
a
nice
bitter
kick
i
do
like
it
wow
a
really
nice
beer
the
feel
is
a
little
thin
well
below
a
moderate
feel
to
me
drinkability
is
awesome
the
nice
residual
bitter
that
the
hop
leaves
keeps
me
wanting
more
and
more
pours
to
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
diminishes
to
just
a
ring
the
aroma
is
citrusy
and
fruity
with
a
sweet
malt
backbone
the
flavor
is
malty
and
citrusy
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
is
medium
in
body
and
easy
drinking
better
than
i
was
expecting
this
beer
is
not
a
british
esb
and
to
my
judgement
leans
far
too
heavily
on
the
american
hops
it
is
an
interesting
beer
which
i
would
call
an
american
brown
ale
or
an
american
ipa
rather
than
an
esb
ive
been
impressed
by
grand
teton
sweetgrass
ipa
was
a
good
one
and
i
still
have
teton
ale
apa
to
sample
if
things
hold
true
to
form
itll
be
a
keeper
as
well
many
thanks
to
ragsdale
for
a
trio
im
hoping
of
wonderful
idaho
beers
consumed
in
october
2004
my
girlfriend
bought
this
back
for
me
from
montana
but
she
was
unaware
of
my
dislike
of
esb
beers
im
not
sure
why
i
dont
like
them
i
love
ipas
and
double
ipas
and
similar
bitter
beers
but
i
have
had
a
few
esbs
and
usually
can
barely
get
them
down
maybe
i
just
need
to
experiment
it
pours
very
nicely
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
and
with
a
big
head
that
just
now
went
away
after
about
5
minutes
the
lacing
is
very
nice
too
you
can
smell
the
bitterness
some
piney
hops
as
well
afraid
to
try
here
it
goes
hmmm
definitely
an
esb
and
it
was
hard
to
swallow
that
first
gulp
definite
pine
hop
taste
and
huge
toffee
or
burnt
coffee
taste
with
a
dry
stout
like
finish
the
aftertaste
wont
go
away
kinda
like
that
cigar
aftertaste
it
just
lingers
i
guess
for
an
esb
its
not
too
bad
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
will
rate
it
accordingly
different
and
if
i
did
like
esbs
ill
bet
i
would
like
it
one
of
the
guys
at
brewers
of
south
suburbia
brought
over
this
bottle
to
our
meeting
interesting
yellowbrown
color
and
a
fizzy
head
pretty
tasty
actually
overhopped
for
a
bitter
but
at
least
its
not
aggresive
not
aggresive
like
an
american
ipa
ruddy
garnet
hue
with
a
light
haze
burly
two
fingered
dogged
tan
head
leaves
intricate
lace
notes
of
orange
zest
drizzled
with
pine
sap
hit
the
nose
at
first
following
are
gentle
wafts
of
lightly
buttery
dark
toffee
and
trace
plum
ester
hints
quite
appetizing
and
well
rounded
aromawise
dominant
in
flavor
is
a
balanced
combination
of
sweet
grainy
biscuit
juicy
ripe
tangerine
and
moderate
citrus
pith
notes
dark
lovibond
caramel
malt
with
a
drying
toasty
edge

as
the
beer
warms
mellow
red
apple
like
ester
add
subtle
complementary
fruit
hints
dextrinous
with
an
agreeably
creamy
viscous
yet
brisk
mouthfeel
apple
character
augments
late
and
tartens
slightly
but
this
only
aids
the
drinkability
and
isnt
at
all
obtrusive
finishes
with
marmalade
and
burnt
toast
hints
fading
quickly
a
delicious
brew
with
both
american
ipa
and
traditional
esb
elements
very
well
crafted
unique
and
superbly
drinkable
indeed
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
and
its
pretty
salty
bottle
pours
brown
thin
tan
head
smell
is
mild
some
sweetness
and
bread
brown
malt
smells
like
a
brown
ale
smells
no
frills
nothing
new
flavor
is
also
particularly
restrained
it
lacks
richness
and
the
flavors
seem
thin
bread
meager
chocolate
caramel
toast
and
the
like
body
is
rather
light
and
also
thin
medium
carbonation
wasnt
good
wasnt
horrible
enjoyed
a
4
oz
pour
at
homegrown
brewhouse
in
summerville
sc
even
in
the
sample
glass
it
pours
with
a
nice
frothy
2
finger
head
the
transparent
light
brown
brew
demonstrates
a
nice
degree
of
clarity
the
cream
colored
head
has
just
a
hint
of
brown
color
and
it
lingers
throughout
great
head
retention
after
every
sip
residual
soapy
lacing
also
clings
to
the
little
glass
the
smell
of
pecan
nuttiness
toasted
grain
greets
the
nose
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
biscuit
like
backdrop
round
out
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
and
nutty
with
an
earthy
toasted
character
it
finishes
pretty
clean
perhaps
the
best
element
of
this
beer
is
the
texture
its
incredibly
smooth
creamy
and
easy
on
the
palate
the
understated
carbonation
enhances
the
mouthfeel
while
theres
nothing
exceptionally
remarkable
about
this
one
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
very
sessionable
very
accessible
experienced
or
intermediate
drinkers
can
enjoy
this
with
equal
measure
years
ago
prior
to
reviewing
beers
id
tried
another
brown
ale
offering
from
rj
rockers
bald
eagle
brown
not
sure
if
this
is
the
same
stuff
rebranded
with
a
more
clever
name
but
i
seem
to
enjoy
this
iteration
more
than
the
other
a
short
head
forms
on
the
pour
and
even
that
drops
to
a
thin
lacing
on
top
below
is
a
beer
that
is
darker
than
mahogany
the
aroma
captures
my
attention
with
a
sweet
nuttiness
toffee
dates
and
overall
joy
its
a
malty
beer
no
question
about
that
with
a
maltiness
which
doesnt
tip
the
balance
for
this
afternoon
brown
eyed
squirrel
hits
the
mark
i
thought
the
beer
was
better
than
the
name
pretty
middle
of
the
road
othis
has
a
good
finish
that
leaves
a
good
a
good
taste
in
your
mouth
rjt
this
brew
is
best
of
the
variety
pack
that
i
picked
up
better
flavors
and
presence
but
poor
presentation
ok
feel
o
not
a
bad
brown
by
any
means
just
missing
the
mark
to
me
brown
ales
are
best
in
fall
and
it
kinda
makes
you
feel
the
season
if
you
get
me
but
this
one
has
off
center
traits
that
pull
it
away
from
being
great
mf
medium
light
bodied
thin
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
seems
contradictory
i
know
o
the
foam
is
a
deal
breaker
for
me
everything
else
is
fine
but
i
dont
like
having
to
wait
ten
minutes
to
finish
filling
a
glasss
o
this
style
is
known
for
being
uninteresting
when
it
comes
to
flavor
but
this
one
is
quite
complex
bready
malty
fruity
and
nutty
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
and
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
typical
bland
brown
ale
not
trying
to
pileon
this
brew
its
my
first
rjr
review
i
like
the
initial
flavor
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
too
reddish
metal
bitter
for
my
liking
a
lack
of
earthiness
smell
was
average
taste
was
very
decent
i
would
very
much
drink
this
one
again
overall
i
like
r
j
rocker
other
beers
but
this
one
i
will
not
be
looking
to
get
again
im
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
brew
it
has
an
interesting
smell
and
taste
however
its
quite
light
in
both
regards
and
perhaps
too
blandly
balanced
there
is
a
slight
hollowness
or
watery
taste
that
makes
this
appear
rather
weak
its
a
decent
drink
however
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
as
a
big
brown
ale
fan
i
cant
say
this
one
really
grabbed
my
attention
pours
a
murky
super
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
cocoa
and
some
nutty
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
burnt
cocoa
and
slight
nutty
flavors
there
is
a
mild
medicinallike
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
with
a
good
smell
but
a
somewhat
disappointing
flavor
overall
it
does
some
things
very
well
but
drops
the
ball
in
other
areas
there
are
better
browns
regardless
of
whether
you
prefer
sweet
or
dry
browns
and
yet
they
got
the
taste
mostly
right
c
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
and
combined
with
the
flavor
results
in
an
extremely
satisfying
beer
o
drinkability
is
high
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
but
the
presence
of
a
lot
of
chunky
floaters
detracts
from
the
appearance
the
aroma
is
light
and
nutty
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
some
chocolate
the
flavor
likewise
has
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
some
dark
caramel
sweetness
but
there
is
also
a
substantial
astringency
that
distracts
and
detracts
from
the
dryly
sweet
flavor
profile
the
thinmedium
body
and
fine
prickly
carbonation
do
little
to
mask
these
problems
overall
although
aspects
of
this
beers
character
are
fine
the
totality
of
the
drinking
experience
is
not
something
to
back
for
super
toasted
malt
mixes
with
a
walnutty
yeast
and
malt
flavor
mix
palate
is
a
little
thin
but
this
beer
is
a
great
session
brew
that
i
wish
i
could
get
in
il
overall
a
pretty
average
brown
ale
i
would
get
again
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
feel
it
has
a
weird
cinnamon
presence
that
dominates
it
looks
good
feels
good
and
tastes
good
but
maybe
not
a
six
pack
i
bought
a
single
bottle
worth
a
try
o
the
beer
is
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
and
pairs
particularly
well
with
burgers
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
i
would
prefer
the
flavor
to
be
sweeter
on
the
back
end
it
has
a
pretty
dry
finish
for
my
taste
but
its
really
good
anyway
o
this
si
a
nice
beer
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
other
rj
rockers
brews
d
glad
its
made
in
my
home
state
so
i
can
just
go
down
the
road
for
a
six
pack
stable
solid
brew
here
pick
one
up
a
goto
brown
ale
o
solid
session
beer
here
nothing
crazy
just
simple
and
good
d
its
not
one
of
rj
rockers
best
in
my
opinion
but
its
fairly
easy
drinking
theres
a
bit
missing
that
is
typically
characteristic
of
the
style
and
its
not
overly
balanced
but
its
still
pretty
enjoyable
i
visit
sc
several
times
a
year
and
this
is
one
that
i
drink
frequently
while
im
there
not
bad
at
all
but
not
great
look
i
am
a
local
and
i
love
local
beers
i
buy
them
and
want
them
to
do
well
if
i
were
honest
however
i
can
say
avoid
this
one
its
average
at
best
the
appearance
has
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
brown
ale
the
smells
okay
what
i
would
expect
from
a
brown
ale
tastewise
uninspired
okay
yes
it
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
but
nothing
really
interesting
nothing
different
from
anything
else
mouthfeel
is
fine
with
okay
carbonation
overall
i
just
have
yet
to
be
wowed
by
an
rj
rockers
brew
they
dont
blow
my
socks
off
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
rust
color
with
orange
in
the
light
halfinch
head
and
lasting
lace
its
aroma
is
fruity
nutty
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
flavor
is
begins
with
caramel
and
a
fruity
malt
sweetness
quickly
taken
over
by
a
hop
bitterness
that
lasts
through
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
r
j
rockers
bald
eagle
brown
is
an
ok
beer
not
recommended
o
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
i
preferred
this
beer
to
their
patriot
pale
its
a
good
brown
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
make
a
fantastic
pitcher
to
order
amongst
friends
bald
eagle
brown
is
pretty
much
par
for
the
course
when
it
comes
to
rj
rockers
beer
in
other
words
its
slightly
better
than
average
but
does
nothing
that
would
elevate
it
into
the
realm
of
even
remotely
special
sparrow
brown
the
more
appropriate
name
would
be
unlikely
to
sell
as
well
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
easy
drinking
and
a
decent
representation
for
the
style
it
comes
together
with
the
favorable
aspects
slightly
edging
out
but
overall
trying
it
once
was
enough
for
me
i
probably
wouldnt
return
to
this
brew
again
pretty
good
example
of
an
english
brown
here
very
strong
nutty
quality
to
the
aroma
and
taste
dark
maltiness
with
hints
of
cocoa
aspects
and
the
merest
hint
of
hops
easy
drinking
brew
not
mind
blowing
by
any
means
but
a
good
go
to
beer
for
pizza
or
pasta
md
medium
bodied
maybe
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
creamy
feel
and
very
easy
drinking
all
in
all
a
nice
example
of
a
brown
ale
bald
eagle
has
session
ale
written
all
of
over
it
with
its
downtoearth
style
hard
to
tell
if
it
was
brewed
in
the
us
or
not
which
shows
that
this
is
a
damn
good
brown
ale
served
from
bottle
into
a
shaker
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
good
lacing
thoughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
and
nutty
notes
the
flavor
followed
the
nose
with
light
roasted
malt
and
nutty
characters
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
brew
however
the
flavors
of
this
one
were
quite
muted
for
some
odd
reason
as
it
warmed
up
they
came
out
a
little
more
but
were
still
not
pronounced
still
a
nice
brown
ale
that
is
worth
trying
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
and
better
fresh
on
tap
i
could
actually
drink
a
few
of
these
pours
a
nice
dark
slightly
hazy
mahogany
with
a
very
thick
tan
head
my
sample
fizzed
like
crazy
decent
aroma
is
malty
fruity
and
a
little
yeasty
malty
flavor
has
a
faint
caramel
undertone
as
well
as
cloves
and
cinnamon
hints
texture
is
smooth
and
somewhat
fizzy
leaving
a
tingly
and
malty
finish
bald
eagle
brown
fits
nicely
with
the
style
and
is
unassuming
i
wish
it
were
more
memorable
but
still
it
is
very
easy
going
down
and
one
could
make
a
long
afternoon
with
this
and
friends
perhaps
while
playing
pickup
football
fairly
aggressive
pour
only
gets
you
half
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
gone
in
a
flash
with
zero
lacing
left
behind
filminess
deepens
the
mahogany
brown
color
stronger
orange
tones
come
out
around
the
edges
along
with
more
clarity
the
nose
has
a
light
touch
caramel
maple
evidence
of
the
malts
yet
theres
also
a
somewhat
bitter
grassiness
to
it
almost
a
saline
quality
too
blanched
almonds
whiff
of
mixed
white
citrus
thats
about
it
lightbodied
the
light
carbonation
not
doing
much
to
activate
whats
there
again
starts
off
with
caramel
toffee
chocolate
powder
and
maple
syrup
here
the
grapefruit
lemon
citrus
component
more
pronounced
the
roastiness
is
generalized
more
feel
than
flavor
the
leafy
hops
keep
it
clearly
on
the
dry
side
of
things
a
few
notes
of
cherry
or
blackberry
fruit
mild
clenching
through
the
finish
not
horrible
by
any
means
just
not
something
id
be
interested
in
tasting
again
overall
a
very
very
good
offering
from
them
this
could
be
a
regualr
session
beer
for
sure
aromas
of
nutty
toasty
malt
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
earthy
leafy
hops
toasty
and
smooth
on
the
palate
showing
very
light
hop
bitterness
with
light
notes
of
molasses
finishes
dryish
and
earthy
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
soft
overall
not
bad
but
could
use
a
bump
in
depth
and
body
its
better
than
some
of
their
other
beers
id
never
heard
of
this
beer
or
brewery
but
heard
a
complete
stranger
recommend
it
as
one
of
the
best
browns
out
there
took
a
chance
and
tried
it
so
glad
i
did
ive
not
found
a
brown
ale
that
i
like
as
much
as
this
one
smooth
low
carbonation
and
nice
coffeecaramel
richness
d
not
bad
but
not
as
smooth
and
drinkable
as
others
great
job
rockers
keep
doing
what
you
are
doing
i
poured
this
beer
ito
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
brown
color
with
with
a
tan
head
the
beer
looked
good
at
first
but
then
the
head
really
went
away
fast
the
beer
did
have
good
lacing
though
which
was
odd
since
the
head
wet
away
fast
the
taste
was
too
hoppy
for
me
to
be
a
brown
ale
thats
just
my
opinion
so
my
opinion
is
that
i
will
not
buy
this
again
d
fine
for
a
few
or
a
session
drinkability
again
this
is
a
middleoftheroad
beer
that
doesnt
pull
any
surprises
it
is
solid
but
not
spectacular
a
worthwhile
session
brew
i
guess
i
made
this
beer
seem
awful
and
it
isnt
actually
not
outstanding
but
not
terrible
so
while
i
would
rate
it
fairly
low
on
any
particular
category
i
find
the
sum
is
better
than
the
parts
and
the
drinkability
is
fairly
high
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
slightly
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
brown
ales
that
i
would
choose
first
its
drinkable
yet
forgettable
not
much
in
the
way
of
depth
here
mediumbodied
with
a
thicker
mouthfeel
the
roasted
bitter
taste
lingers
on
your
tongue
and
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
which
i
would
gladly
do
its
still
a
little
heavy
and
awkward
though
i
would
drink
many
of
these
a
very
solid
rendition
of
an
english
style
brown
ale
with
a
bit
of
an
american
twist
a
little
more
malt
and
a
little
more
hops
to
balance
it
nicely
done
d
a
good
looking
and
good
smelling
brown
ale
that
falls
a
little
short
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
departments
drinkable
but
not
memorable
not
bad
but
there
are
many
a
better
brown
ale
out
there
d
nothing
wrong
with
this
offering
from
rjr
although
i
like
their
1
5
apa
a
bit
better
this
one
could
benefit
from
some
more
dedicated
malting
to
produce
even
a
finer
brew
well
carbonated
and
finishes
easy
but
not
great
a
bit
of
residue
on
the
back
end
and
a
bit
too
watery
of
a
finish
pulled
from
a
variety
12pack
i
picked
up
at
state
line
in
maryland
appears
a
clear
redbrown
in
glass
with
a
tall
head
that
quickly
disappears
while
i
thought
the
patriot
pale
was
a
good
simple
beer
i
think
this
is
a
bad
simple
beer
the
flavor
is
a
little
watery
which
is
a
kiss
of
death
when
youre
looking
for
a
great
session
beer
instead
of
being
fullflavored
yet
drinkable
its
a
little
thick
and
not
very
tasty
the
aroma
has
a
pleasant
dry
cocoa
note
but
the
flavor
is
just
simple
dark
bread
crust
with
a
touch
of
juicy
caramel
not
much
else
id
pass
nothing
spectacular
here
but
a
crisp
easydrinking
brown
ale
this
beer
has
some
body
smooth
and
creamy
feel
and
all
around
tasty
an
easy
session
beer
choice
any
time
of
year
id
go
back
to
it
for
sure
drinkability
i
love
brown
ales
and
i
highly
recommend
this
as
a
shining
example
of
the
style
if
you
can
get
this
beer
try
it
this
is
a
very
plain
brown
ale
it
fits
the
profile
very
well
but
nothing
exceptional
nice
malty
body
with
a
cleaner
hops
finish
grades
as
average
in
aroma
and
appearance
with
a
nice
medium
brown
color
with
cream
head
and
predominately
malt
scent
with
some
caramel
a
decent
beer
good
for
non
micro
folks
being
introduced
to
new
beers
ive
had
a
few
different
rj
rockers
beers
recently
and
i
think
they
are
much
improved
overall
this
brown
is
solid
for
the
style
relatively
understated
but
balanced
and
tasty
pours
a
coppery
brown
with
a
moderate
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
nice
color
but
the
head
could
be
a
bit
thicker
nice
dry
toasty
aroma
with
some
nuttiness
quite
dry
similar
in
taste
with
a
nice
nutty
dryness
some
nice
moderate
toastiness
and
a
touch
of
coppey
metal
in
the
finish
quite
nice
smooth
medium
bodied
and
drying
on
the
finish
in
the
mouth
quite
respectable
i
enjoyed
this
poured
to
a
light
brown
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
lingered
awhile
and
left
little
lacing
nose
was
a
combination
of
malty
nuts
and
chocolate
and
the
taste
represented
the
same
motuhfeel
was
flat
and
somewhat
watery
ut
the
finish
was
smooth
im
going
against
the
grain
some
on
this
one
in
that
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
especially
for
a
beer
i
had
never
heard
of

is
a

drinkable
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
browns
out
there
with
fuller

really
enjoyed
this
as
a
session
beer
good
character
and
good
flavors
on
every
level
blah
d
this
is
nice
english
brown
that
pushes
the
style
envolope
just
enough
to
give
it
some
character
yet
still
remains
true
goes
down
a
little
too
easy
enough
to
be
dissappointed
when
its
finished
ive
been
exploring
english
browns
and
this
is
my
personal
favorite
so
far
not
the
best
brown
ale
but
its
certainly
decent
and
one
of
the
better
offerings
i
have
had
from
r
j
rockers
drinkability
sure
its
very
drinkable
but
i
certainly
would
appreciate
a
heft
to
both
its
body
and
overall
malt
character
d
this
is
a
very
approachable
beer
and
i
could
definitely
see
drinking
it
again
its
faults
are
really
just
that
it
doesnt
quite
bring
enough
flavor
to
the
table
otherwise
it
is
a
fair
enough
little
beer
drinkability
i
had
more
than
one
cheers
clear
brownamber
color
distinct
nutty
flavor
went
down
very
easy
no
offtastes
like
i
have
experienced
with
newcastle
for
instance
i
would
choose
the
patriot
or
the
bell
ringer
from
r
j
rockers
before
the
bald
eagle
but
nevertheless
an
enjoyable
beer
the
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
dissipates
to
whisps
of
foam
leaving
some
lace
sweetness
dominates
the
aroma
with
smells
of
caramel
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
also
full
of
caramel
with
some
bitter
roasty
characteristics
the
body
is
just
under
medium
slightly
thin
but
the
carbonation
is
nice
it
is
a
easy
drinking
sessionable
brown
but
nothing
overly
complex
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
but
it
misses
the
mark
stylistically
the
yeast
needs
more
time
to
clean
up
its
byproducts
and
a
little
more
specialty
malt
needs
to
be
in
there
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
nutty
caramel
smooth
perhaps
a
bit
underattenuated
as
residual
sweetness
seems
to
be
bordering
on
cloyingly
sweet
d
not
bad
at
all
good
balance
nice
robust
toastiness
modest
abv
guessing
here
that
its
around
5
id
have
this
one
again
thanks
for
sending
jeff
and
for
helping
me
check
another
state
off
the
list
36
down
good
dark
brown
color
the
fun
ends
there
decent
chocolate
caramel
smell
weak
thin
watery
malt
flavor
this
beer
is
unimpressive
i
could
knock
them
back
all
night
because
of
the
lack
of
mouthfeel
and
the
all
around
wateriness
but
i
could
do
the
same
with
bud
light
poured
a
nice
crisp
semidark
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
aroma
is
dark
malts
and
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
burnt
caramel
mild
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
dried
fruits
and
coffee
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
with
low
carbonation
while
i
could
see
this
making
for
a
decent
session
its
just
not
anything
id
usually
seek
out
that
often
i
am
glad
to
taste
some
good
stuff
out
of
sc
however
overall
pretty
good
with
great
balance
average
mouthfeel
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
not
balanced
enough
may
be
fine
for
others
but
i
will
pass
this
is
a
great
beer
that
is
easy
to
session
and
just
may
be
my
favorite
rj
rockers
beer
this
beer
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
with
a
slight
head
the
smell
was
caramel
like
the
taste
was
somewhat
like
brown
sugar
this
beer
was
very
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
hopefully
r
j
will
start
distributing
in
nc
soon
not
crazy
about
this
one
its
too
close
to
soda
could
be
a
fine
brown
ale
the
recipe
just
needs
some
tweaking
its
as
if
the
brewery
is
holding
back
it
needs
more
personality
or
character
or
something
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
r
j
rockers
patriot
pale
ale
that
i
received
in
the
same
trade
d

a
good
thirst
quencher
due
to
its
light
wateriness
but
still
a
great
flavor
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
and
maybe
a
good
beer
for
starters
in
hops
and
a
good
representation
of
a
english
brown
ale
pours
a
clear
medium
shade
of
brown
with
a
thinner
white
head
that
s
gone
pretty
quickly
no
lace
behind
as
it
settlesearthy
unsweetened
chocolate
dominate
the
aromas
with
a
touch
of
brown
suger
very
basic
brown
ale
flavors
bitter
chocolate
and
a
little
nutty
with
a
dryer
abrupt
finish
a
basic
straight
to
the
point
brown
alenothing
out
of
the
ordinary
flavor
wise
not
bad
for
the
style
but
wouldnt
seek
out
again
quaffed
a
few
at
abbys
restaurant
in
spartanburg
sc
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
no
lacing
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
rich
chocolate
malt
flavor
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
tastes
like
a
bass
used
to
taste
only
better
drinkability
a
very
nice
brown
ale
with
a
surprising
degree
of
chocolate
flavor
i
just
feel
sorry
for
the
poor
souls
in
the
restaurant
who
i
saw
ordering
bottles
of
the
macros
they
had
no
idea
was
was
so
close
and
how
much
better
it
was
modeled
after
a
traditional
deep
brown
english
brown
ale
pours
a
deep
brown
couldnt
judge
the
head
because
i
was
tasting
in
a
2
5
oz
shot
glass
has
a
nose
of
chocolate
and
malt
has
a
taste
of
malt
chocolate
and
a
slight
hops
for
balance
great
beer
great
color
and
finish
also
has
a
better
than
average
carbonation
level
for
a
brown
i
am
an
ipa
and
brown
ale
lover
which
effects
my
score
i
poured
it
down
the
drain
after
a
half
of
glass
something
i
never
do
had
this
from
12
oz
bottle
a
very
nice
brown
ale
with
more
complexity
than
most
should
appeal
to
most
dark
amber
color
with
mild
head
and
very
little
carbonation
strong
nutty
aroma
hints
of
burned
wood
and
toasted
malt
hop
flavors
that
i
did
not
expect
sweet
mild
flavor
tart
with
a
spice
at
the
of
the
sip
easy
to
drink
not
the
worst
but
there
are
better
out
there
poured
into
a
kansas
city
royals
pint
glass
but
do
not
worry
the
mediocrity
of
the
team
does
not
affect
the
beer
in
this
case
the
beer
was
just
mediocre
thin
thin
thin
and
only
slightly
flavorful
light
brown
in
appearance
is
this
darker
on
tap
and
no
head
to
speak
of
luckily
i
only
had
one
bottle
of
this
in
a
mixandmatch
6er
wont
try
again
from
the
bottle
fair
head
for
a
brown
with
some
lingering
lacing
on
the
glass
color
is
very
clear
for
a
brown
a
very
mild
nutty
aroma
not
impressive
taste
and
mouth
feel
are
extremely
thin
theres
really
not
much
here
to
satisfy
given
arcadias
strong
distribution
in
michigan
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
them
this
is
way
too
bland
pass
it
up
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
brown
almost
reminded
me
of
a
lighter
bock
at
times
id
like
to
have
it
fresh
to
truly
give
a
definite
say
tastefeel
average
is
as
average
does
it
tastes
like
the
smell
light
on
the
aroma
light
on
the
taste
easy
drinking
but
its
just
a
middleoftheroad
brown
thats
just
not
that
interesting
arcadia
doesnt
make
the
best
beer
but
they
make
typical
examples
of
styles
without
trying
to
change
the
rules
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers

spotty

thanks
btw
im
sure
the
hops
have
faded
out
a
bit
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
coppergarnet
color
with
a
thin
khaki
head
ok
retention
as
a
collar
and
the
lacing
was
consistent
in
thin
bands
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
notably
nutty
with
toasted
malt
caramel
malt
and
a
light
floral
hops
presence
the
flavors
were
at
first
a
flash
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
soon
followed
by
doughy
malt
then
the
toasted
malt
nuts
and
a
long
bitter
finish
that
coated
my
tongue
provided
by
the
hops
similar
to
coffee
but
not
quite
so
biting
a
nice
flavor
arc
and
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
perfect

a

light
of

aroma
is
great
but
could
just
be
a
little
stronger
taste
is
dominated
by
a
heavy
dose
of
dark
crystal
malt
a
little
pleasant
alcohol
around
the
edges
but
nothing
extreme
pretty
sparing
on
any
chocolate
maltroasted
barley
which
keeps
it
nicely
in
the
realm
of
a
true
british
brown
mouthfeel
is
dead
on
with
a
great
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
light
on
the
tongue
but
prickly
and
cleansing
down
the
throat
a
very
drinkable
nut
brown
the
kind
you
just
want
more

another

brew
from

this
is
one
of
the
best

ales
ive
had
since
they
made
the
newcastles
in
brown
stubbies
nice

nothing
to
get
you
really
excited
the
taste
is
cider
again
but
a
nice
nutty
finish
evidences
the
reason
for
the
name
its
overcarbonated
and
too
light
bodied
for
a
session
but
the
nutty
finish
is
nice
d
relatively
average
brown
ale
good
but
far
from
great
d
i
dont
really
care
for
this
one
thats
what
my
wife
tells
me
to
say
in
public
instead
of
this
sucks
big
fat
hairy
goat
balls
once
i
told
her
in
front
of
herfamily
that
her
aunts
root
vegetable
salad
tasted
like
disease
instead
i
should
have
just
said
i
really
care
for
this
how
can
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
smell
so
offensive
and
taste
so
mediocre
da
very
mild
dark
ale
which
makes
for
enhanced
session
drinking
this
is
the
first
experiance
with
arcadia
and
while
its
nothing
spectacular
will
probably
try
again
d
not
over
powering
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
so
it
becomes
a
decent
session
beer
nothing
above
and
beyond
pretty
mediocore
dthis
is
a
decent
brew
at
bestnot
something
i
would
seek
outbut
not
one
to
avoid
either
pours
a
very
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
opague
head
lots
of
foam
from
t
his
beer
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
hoppy
for
a
nut
brown
ale
while
it
of
course
has
some
malty
aroma
it
has
some
nice
mild
hop
aromas
too
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
aroma
a
nice
mixture
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
taste
is
good
overall
if
it
were
more
readily
available
it
probably
would
be
a
go
to
for
me
prosit
mk
beer
produced
a
good
two
finger
head
with
decent
lacing
throughout
the
duration
of
the
drink
the
high
point
of
the
beer
was
that
it
has
a
nice
dark
amber
color
smell
was
somewhat
lacking
some
faint
nuttiness
but
almost
seemed
like
a
metallic
smell
taste
was
nothing
exciting
once
again
the
nuttiness
made
an
appearance
but
nothing
really
stands
out
beer
was
a
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
the
drinkability
was
okay
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
though
d
not
bad
complex
but
not
as
overall
balanced
as
i
would
have
liked
the
nuttiness
is
there
in
spades
malt
bitterness
as
well
not
a
beer
to
suck
down
but
a
good
beer
overall
enjoyable
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
soapy
twofinger
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
the
smell
is
very
light
not
much
to
say
about
it
i
think
i
can
smell
a
bit
of
biscuity
character
and
floral
hops
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
i
had
expected
from
a
nut
brown
ale
it
seems
to
lack
the
toasted
nutty
character
that
one
might
expect
from
such
an
ale
there
really
isnt
much
of
a
hop
presence
to
speak
of
either
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
difficult
to
classify
in
that
it
doesnt
really
have
any
discernable
qualities
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
carbonation

of
this
one
is
pretty
high
but
i
dont
think
i
would
call
it
a
nut
brown
ale
beautful
deep
ruby
brown
pour
out
of
the
12oz
bottle
in
to
my
imperial
pint
glass
foming
with
a
white
head
carmel
malt
sweetness
mixed
in
with
a
roasted
nuttyness
wafes
forth
from
the
glass
this
medium
bodied
brew
has
a
nice
hop
bite
ballenced
by
a
toasty
toffie
and
carmel
malt
profile
theres
a
nice
play
with
the
tofie
hops
and
sweetness
drinkability
this
will
probably
be
a
drain
pour
i
have
had
other
arcadia
ales
and
enjoyed
them
so
i
can
only
assume
something
is
wrong
with
this
beer
but
nearly
my
entire
mixed
12
pack
has
had
carbonation
issues
maybe
they
are
having
some
qc
issues
truth
be
told
this
is
a
fairly
standard
completely
average
brown
ale
it
is
a
bit
watery
but
thats
not
even
too
distracting
all
of
your
roasted
nut
flavors
burnt
caramel
a
slight
hop
bite
are
here
all
doing
their
job
adequately
enough
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
then
again
theres
nothing
too
exciting
about
it
either
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
genre
and
have
one
at
your
disposal
go
for
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
one
arcadia
beer
seems
to
be
hit
london
porter
imperial
stout
hopmouth
dipa
or
miss
all
the
rest
unfortunately
nut
brown
ale
fits
squarely
into
the
latter
category
i
dont
know
if
the
sourness
is
intended
or
not
but
it
isnt
a
characteristic
that
complements
very
many
styles
better
browns
shouldnt
be
too
hard
to
find
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
less
than
average
it
has
a
contaminated
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
sour
spoiled
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
less
than
average
as
well
it
has
a
weak
and
watery
brown
ale
flavor
that
goes
down
quick
butt
sours
in
the
finish
there
is
definately
some
contamination
here
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
ones
going
down
the
drain
i
really
cant
believe
that
a
brewery
would
distribute
all
over
the
country
beer
that
is
clearly
subpar
and
bacteria
exposed
wheres
the
quality
control
pours
a
nice
dark
brownish
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
some
nic
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
sour
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
sourtangy
dark
fruits
and
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
theres
a
pattern
with
these
arcadia
brews
that
im
not
really
liken
so
far
of
the
three
ive
had
so
far
today
there
is
a
tendency
to
be
sour
when
not
called
for
in
my
opinion
maybe
bad
bottles
or
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
so
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
so
far
my
guess
is
that
this
is
not
intended
but
they
should
do
this
to
more
of
their
brown
ales
and
package
them
under
a
different
name
as
an
english
brown
id
have
to
score
this
one
quite
low
as
a
sour
brown
the
scores
would
be
near
jolly
pumpkin
levels
but
as
a
beer
it
was
only
nice
light
and
tangy
on
the
tongue
plenty
carbonated
and
a
mild
yet
sharp
finish
not
much
smoothness
and
rather
uncharacteristic
of
the
style
good
though
very
interesting

good

while
including
a
twist
to

a

different
its
a
very
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
an

medium

bit
boringnothing
here
to
make
me
want
to
drink
more
of
it
a
decent
offering
in
the
style
this
one
is
great
to
enjoy
with
a
pork
chop
dinner
worth
the
try
especially
if
you
can
get
the
mixed
pack
t
sample
a
few
other
offerings
from
the
brewer
overall
nothing
special
happening
here
just
a
sweet
light
brown
ale
refreshing
though
d
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
nice
hazelnut
notes
at
first
glance
of
this
beer
in
my
glass
it
was
a
brownamber
color
darker
than
i
expected
after
pouring
there
was
nary
a
head
to
mention
the
smell
was
not
overpowering
yet
not
underwelming
either
definitley
a
hint
of
nuts
along
with
a
maltyhoppy
smell
at
first
taste
i
must
admit
i
was
not
a
big
fan
mostly
because
of
what
i
was
drinking
before
but
as
i
consumed
more
of
this
tasty
beverage
my
feelings
started
to
change
it
was
very
hoppy
a
hint
of
caramel
and
malt
as
well
the
more
i
consumed
the
better
it
tasted
it
had
a
very
clean
and
crisp
taste
to
it
all
and
all
a
good
beer
and
they
have
a
fan
in
me
if
you
live
near
the
downtown
bk
area
i
recommend
that
you
stop
in
and
enjoy
this
delicious
brew
while
its
still
being
offered
in
their
cask
selection
this
is
a
decent
brown
it
pours
a
rich
brown
with
a
very
small
head
yellow
in
color
smells
of
just
a
hint
of
hop
with
toasty
malt
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
tastes
just
about
the
same
a
real
dry
nut
flavor
is
present
it
is
a
clean
drinker
average
all
round
beer
quite
easy
to
quaff
not
as
smooth
as
it
could
be
but
overall
it
isnt
bad
but
there
are
other
browns
out
there
worth
drinking
more
than
this
overall
a
good
drinkable
brown
ale
sessionable
for
sure
but
for
the
most
part
uneventful
poured
into
a
pint
glass
deep
brown
with
a
moderately
sized
fluffy
tan
head
good
retention
smells
malty
with
a
slight
touch
of
caramel
maybe
a
little
nut
as
well
taste
is
nutty
and
malty
kind
of
creamy
however
it
stills
feel
thin
too
much
carbonation
not
enough
of
the
creamy
texture
not
the
most
drinkable
but
nothing
to
throw
down
the
drain
either
give
it
a
shot
drinkability
i
like
it
enjoyable
sessionable
affordable
d
this
beer
has
some
good
flavors
but
has
some
off
flavors
that
balance
it
very
approachable
and
companionable
this
a
mellow
and
wellcrafted
brown
ale
that
anyone
can
be
comfortable
with
a
solid
effort
from
arcadia
drinkability
average
to
slightly
above
average
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
most
weather
goes
great
with
veggie
burgers
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
good
clean
white
head
there
is
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
of
roasted
malt
and
nut
there
is
also
a
bit
of
hop
presence
nothing
too
bold
flavor
is
mostly
malt
and
nut
it
is
also
pleasantly
sweet
moreso
than
i
remember
most
brown
ales
being
well
balanced
and
very
nice
in
the
mouth
arcadia
brown
is
pretty
full
and
sweet
there
is
moderate
carbonation
and
a
ton
of
sweetness
overall
i
was
mildly
surprised
by
this
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
rendition
of
a
nut
brown
ale
that
to
my
mind
is
a
step
above
typical
newcastle
clones
an
inoffensive
and
pleasant
brew

malty
and
fine
for
style
seems
to
be
a
wellbrewed
example
from
arcadia
and
among
their
better
beers
in
my
opinion
from
tasting
notes
on
my
blog
pilgrims
pub
this
beer
pours
a
paper
bag
brown
with
two
and
a
half
finger
tan
head
that
spills
over
my
glass
from
vigorous
pour
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
the
taste
is
toasted

a
light
almond

nuttiness
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
medium

really
easy
and
delicious

great
session
beer
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
good
giving
off
a
nuttish
aroma
the
taste
and
mouthfeeldrinkability
was
exceptional
if
i
was
able
to
distinguish
detailed
scents
and
flavors
at
this
time
i
would
be
more
discriptive
good
brew
bottom
line
here
ya
go
colin
this
ones
for
you
poured
out
to
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
huge
off
white
head
that
calmed
down
after
a
few
moments
lace
litters
the
interior
of
the
glass
aromas
of
roasted
nuts
and
sweet
earth
fills
the
nose
nice
taste
is
high
on
the
yum
scale
flavors
of
roasted
nuts
mild
malts
sweet
spices
and
young
hops
blend
together
very
well
this
is
a
much
better
sample
than
my
last
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
bodied
and
smooth
goes
down
very
nice
a
good
level
of
drinkability
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
thank
my
pal
sopor
for
providing
a
fresh
sample
recommended
moderate
body
and
pleasant
carbonation
make
this
pretty
refreshing
not
a
seesion
brew
and
not
super
quaffable
but
i
could
easilly
see
myself
keeping
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
around
if
i
had
my
perfect
cellar
uhoh
i
suspected
trouble
when
i
opened
the
bottle
took
a
whiff
and
checked
to
make
sure
i
didnt
accidently
open
a
bottle
of
grape
soda
the
two
smells
are
indistinguishable
so
then
i
pour
it
into
a
glass
and
become
downright
suspicious
with
a
gentle
pour
i
was
left
with
a
glass
entirely
filled
with
foam
this
must
be
a
bad
bottle
right
but
it
was
part
of
a
sampler
and
the
other
beers
were
fine
ok
not
very
good
but
fine
so
now
im
pretty
convinced
that
this
is
how
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
after
several
minutes
of
settling
this
beer
has
a
nice
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
as
stated
is
sweet
and
fruity
like
grape
juice
the
flavor
is
not
far
off
from
grape
juice
either
its
sweet
fruity
and
tangy
the
yeast
tastes
sour
another
weak
beer
from
a
brewery
that
is
really
failing
to
impress
i
would
like
another
of
these
but
i
only
purchased
one
i
had
avoided
this
just
on
looks
for
the
longest
time
i
think
arcadia
could
use
a
new
label
maker
as
i
truly
believe
it
would
help
their
cause
as
unfair
as
it
seems
good
soup
served
in
a
dirty
bowl
doesnt
always
get
the
credit
it
deserves
this
beer
has
possibly
the
worst
bottle
design
ive
ever
seen
its
so
incredibly
bland
and
amateurish
that
i
think
ive
unconsciously
put
off
trying
the
couple
of
bottles
i
got
from
sopor
in
a
trade
simply
because
of
the
awfulness
of
the
label
thankfully
the
label
is
by
far
the
worst
part
pours
a
nice
redtinted
dark
brown
with
a
pretty
beige
head
and
really
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
drink
not
a
whole
lot
of
scent
a
little
roasty
a
little
mapley
but
nothing
jumps
out
the
taste
is
really
good
a
bitter
roasted
base
with
sweet
mapley
overtones
aftertaste
is
quite
pleasant
bitter
with
a
little
bit
of
the
maple
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
this
beer
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
goes
exceedingly
well
with
the
flavors
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
smooth
beer
sort
of
a
lighter
version
of
a
porter
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
i
could
use
some
more
body
here
carbonation
is
nice
and
works
well
there
was
nothing
that
really
stood
out
to
me
here
a
decent
brown
ale
that
almost
comes
off
as
a
lager
to
me
not
one
ill
be
seeking
out
in
the
future
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
to
ruby
brown
color
with
a
small
ring
of
head
the
nose
is
mostly
caramel
wtih
a
slight
nutty
quality
but
not
enough
roastedness
for
me
the
flavor
is
not
all
that
good
it
starts
out
with
a
slightly
chemically
artificial
flavor
that
moves
to
a
slightly
roasted
nuttyness
wtih
an
astringent
aftertaste
that
really
detracts
from
the
brew
the
feel
is
thin
to
light
moderate
with
an
active
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
that
i
have
been
less
than
impressed
with
the
flavor
and
feel
really
dont
do
well
for
this
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
received
as
selection
of
brew
tour
beer
of
the
month
club
poured
a
nice
brown
color
with
minimal
head
and
smell
of
roasted
coffee
it
had
a
nice
taste
but
nothing
extraordinary
left
a
dry
taste
in
the
mouth
that
was
not
unpleasant
probably
will
not
try
again
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
i
find
that
it
would
make
a
nice
drink
on
occassion
probably
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
brew
ill
try
another
bottle
and
see
if
i
get
more
carbonation
throws
a
dark
red
accompanied
by
a
decent
yet
thin
brown
head
that
will
maintain
a
nice
little
sheet
over
this
brew
nose
is
very
weak
yet
some
malts
and
toasted
wheat
crackers
are
detectable
floral
hops
and
toffee
are
noted
up
front
this
brown
is
quite
sweet
nutty
based

some
toffee
and
light
coffee
bean
flavorings
a
bit
overcarbonated
with
fresh
baked
bread
tastings
left
on
the
palate
all
in
all
a
decent
brown
this
beer
is
nothing
earth
shattering
but
is
an
easy
drinking
brown
ale
id
say
this
is
a
good
alternative
for
your
newcastle
drinker

lots

is
full
of

there
is
a
slight
nuttiness
to
the
flavor
which
balances
well
with
a
slight
cocoaish
malt
taste
not
overly
rich
but
this
means
the
beer
could
be
a
good
session
brew
nice
medium

is
also
present
worth
a
shot
in
my
opinion
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
light
brown

and
decent
lace
smell
is
a
nice

also
a
nice
roasted
malt
with
nutty
overtones
slight
coffee
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
a
bit
dry
with
a
medium
heaviness
a
nice
alternative
when
a
porter
is
a
bit
much
good
drinkability
for
a
cool
evening
a
fairly
simple
brown
ale
but
done
right
a
decent
brown
easy
to
drink
but
not
particularly
exciting
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
citruicy
hops
red
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
heat
that
quickly
recedes
to
nothing
flavor
is
good
if
not
overly
engaging
malty
and
a
touch
sweet
with
a
hint
of
caramel
hopping
is
noticable
without
standing
out
too
much
pours
a
dark
amber
clear
liquid
with
a
nice
off
white
foamy
head
good
lace
on
the

as
the
brew
disappears
the
smell
is
somewhat
of
a
sweet
caramel
with
a
hint
of
a
toasted
nuts
tasteis
a
nice
nutty
flavor
with
some
sweetness
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
a
good
toasty
flavor
comes
out
in
the
end
decent
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
there
is
nothing
that
really
blew
me
away
about
this
beer
but
then
again
nothing
that
would
drive
me
away
a
good
session
brown
ale
alas
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
and
for
some
reason
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
a
lot
more
than
id
expect
for
a
5

abv
brown
ale
mild
lemon
and
lime
bitterness
and
a
taste
of
pear
bandy
round
out

authentic
nut
brown
style
a
bronze
body
is
topped
with
a
very
full
offwhite
head
decent
lacing
from
the
residual
and
lots
of
very
nice
aromas
come
from
the
rich
malting
the
nut
sense
is
there
along
with
some
decent
fruit
notes
as
well
the
somewhat
thin
body
gives
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
and
the
fruit
comes
into
the
taste
as
well
as
it
did
in
the
smell
good
drinkability
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
as
one
would
expect
aroma
was
malt
with
some
nutty
notes
along
with
a
faint
hint
of
roasted
barley
head
was
thick
and
off
white
in
color
taste
was
mainly
caramel
with
a
nut
finish
highlighted
by
just
a
touch
of
bitterings
felt
a
little
bit
weak
in
the
mouht
beer
seemed
a
little
thin
for
some
reason
the
balance
of
malt
nut
and
bitter
just
didnt
seem
to
work
for
me
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
truly
seek
out
overall
a
slightly
better
than
average
example
of
the
style
while
not
horrific
there
are
a
number
of
better
brown
ales
to
be
found
and
savored
nothing
overwhelming
about
this
brew
pretty
solid
and
well
balanced
has
a
nutty
flavor
walnuts
along
with
some
caramel
a
bit
of
hops
that
seem
to
provide
little
flavor
in
the
beer
i
dont
notice
any
alcohol
taste
in
it
pretty
ordinary
but
easy
to
drink
and
still
tastes
good
just
not
great
its
pretty
murky
brown
in
color
and
the
head
is
tan
and
medium
sized
the
aroma
is
a
little
bit
of
nuts
and
caramel
flavors
are
smooth
and
pretty
enjoyable
nutty
caramel
and
some
hop
character
in
the
finish
seemed
a
little
overly
sweet
at
times
and
not
well
balanced
its
pretty
enjoyable
though
worth
a
try
but
there
are
many
better
nut
brown
ales
out
there
this
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
virtually
no
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
malt
with
hints
of
nuts
the
flavor
was
a
smooth
maltiness
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
nuts
like
most
brown
ales
ive
had
it
isnt
very
heavily
hopped
and
would
probably
benefit
from
more
of
a
hop
flavor
overall
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thin
but
persistant
head
that
produces
some
lace
on
the
glass
nose
is
buscuity
and
nutty
predominantly
malt
but
with
a
bit
of
herbal
hop
backing
flavor
is
malty
with
bread
nuts
and
a
backing
touch
of
coffee
finishes
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
has
a
meduim
body
and
low
carbonation
this
is
an
average
or
slightly
above
average
brown
ale
moderately
carbonated
reddishmahogany
liquid

with
small
bubbles
forming
a
thin
beige
head
which
tends
to
stay
around
nose
is
dominated
by
chocolate
raisins
and
prunes
similar
to
a
strong

or

malty
sweetness
and
mild
flavor
hops
gives
way
to
cocoa
and
round
english
hops
in
the
wet
finish
very
little
astringency
and
a
somewhat
firm
syrupy
mouthfeel
not
being
a
big
fan
of
american
style
brown
ales
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
complexity
of
this
beer
however
i
would
much
prefer
bells
best
brown
over
any
other
beer
of
this
style
deep
mahogany
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
keeps
a
very
nice
collar
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
expresses
a
sweet
cocoaish
maltiness
and
a
floral
hoppiness
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
that
caresses
the
tongue
the
flavor
consists
of
a
semisweet
chocolatey
malt
thats
well
infused
with
floral
and
lightly
citrusy
hop
flavor
it
becomes
sweeter
with
more
cocoaish
toffee
notes
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
but
theyre
quickly
pushed
aside
by
a
rising
solid
bitterness
that
ushers
in
a
dry
finish
more
grassy
hop
flavor
lingers
in
the
finish
very
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
and
hops
working
together
but
also
appearing
seperately
throughout
the
tasting
well
done
i
found
it
more
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
and
bitterness
gave
way
to
more
of
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
definitely
an
american
brown
ale
part
of
and
arcadia
sampler
this
was
a
pretty
good

brown
poured
a
dark
brownishamber
with
virtually
no
head
or

strong

aroma
flavor
was
not
very
rich
but
was
nutty
with
some
malt
lightly
bitter

nutty

the
top
thin
the
finish
is
discriminatingly
hopped
and
discerningly
acidic
the
aftertaste
dry
and
long
lasting
drinkable
but
pretty
much
an
average
nut
brown
but
then
thats
nothing
to
get
upset
about
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
pours
out
to
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
light
nutty
caramel
taste
the
hops
dont
overpower
this
but
really
make
it
finish
nice
i
could
see
making
a
session
or
two
or
three
out
of
this
one
pours
medium
brown
with
a
tinge
of
dark
maroon
a
good
colored
dark

unfortunately
dissipated
very
quickly
deep
aromas
of
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
sweet

taste
was
underwhelming
some
roasty
sweet
depth
but
not
much
small
amounts
of
bitterness
and
no
alcohol
bite
which
was
good
feel
was
creamy
but
with
medium
high
carbonation
which
was
offputting
overall
a
fair
brown
ale
it
met
the
standard
of
brown
ales
well
just
left
a
little
to
be
desired
in
richness
and
depth
easy
drinking
but
not
bold
enough
does
not
feel
like
a

i
really
like
a
couple
of
the
other
real
ale
beers
o
this
is
a
substantial
thick
and
malty
brown
ale
in
the
english
style
it
is
very
close
to
a
porter
in
many
ways
which
is
just
fine
by
me
extremely
clean
and
wellmade
i
highly
recommend
it
this
beer
seems
like
the
halfway
point
between
bud
and
guinness
not
sure
if
thats
a
compliment
or
not
o
very
black
ipalike
not
an
english
brown
ale
too
many
hops
its
not
bad
just
mislabelled
stylewise
a
brew
definitely
worth
investigating
and
for
the
price
not
bad
at
all
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
more
americanstyle
brown
ale
c
o
certainly
ok
nonoffensive
beer
but
wont
be
looking
for
any
more
o
a
very
dry
brown
kinda
gives
it
a
bland
flavor
that
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
still
a
nice
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
brown
very
good
for
a
brown
ale
smooth
and
delicious
on
the
whole
this
is
better
than
some
brown
ales
ive
had
but
for
the
english
style
its
nothing
to
brag
about
on
tap
at
crickets
in
lubbock
from
notes
overlooked
after
11072012
tasting
served
in
a
pint
glass
a
little
under
14
inch
head
dark
brownblack
color
smells
like
nuts
coffee
and
syrup
however
the
taste
and
feel
is
very
light
it
smells
heavier
than
it
feels
i
can
taste
molasses
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
subtle
smoke
the
carbonation
isnt
bad
all
and
all
not
bad
for
a
brown
ale
ill
definitely
have
this
again
overall
its
quite
enjoyable
i
have
enjoyed
beers
from
this
company
so
far
and
plan
to
try
more
of
them
when
i
can
popping
the
top
this
brew
has
a
smell
of
pancake
syrup
and
molasses
pours
to
a
root
beer
color
with
a
tan
head
taste
is
sweet
yet
with
just
the
right
bitterness
to
cleanse
the
sweetness
mouthfeel

carbonated
just
right
to
bring
up
the
dry
milk
chocolate
flavor
finish
is
well
balanced
as
well
as
it
is
flatly
sweet
wit
some
bitterness
a
very
smooth
drinker
i
shall
return
a
decent
brown
ale
although
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
nutty
taste
which
would
have
kept
it
more
true
to
style

poured
into

glass
pours
dark
toffee
brown
with
a
creamy
biege
head
the
beer
is
not
completely
opaque
because
some
ruby
brown
color
is
visible
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
leaving
no
lacing
along
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
barley
malt
with
some
nuttiness
and
chocolate
the
taste
follows
the
nose
very
well
there
are
rich
flavors
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
that
carry
some
mild
sweetness
with
the
roasty
character
really
coming
through
in
the
back
there
are
flavors
of
chocolate
in
the
front
and
that
nutty
character
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
coats
the
tongue
really
well
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
there
is
a
dry
finish
to
this
beer
it
is
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
a
satisfying
brown
ale
o
its
a
solid
smooth
brown
ale
its
very
basic
but
it
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
o
pleasant
but
wholly
plain
not
too
much
there
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
another
part
of
my
first
beer
trade
with
dolph1979
served
from
a
bottle
into
a
room
temperature
mug
nice
nutty
flavor
great
mahogany
brown
color
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
head
and
is
a
bit
fizzy
for
my
taste
but
a
good
overall
beer
some
lacing
a
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
another
go
maybe
not
a
regular
but
one
that
will
meet
a
need
in
a
pinch
overall
a
good
beer
but
this
one
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
with
a
heavy
meal
like
a
steak
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
not
very
impressive
overall
o
pretty
decent
brown
ale
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
but
nothing
setting
it
apart
either
o
i
have
had
this
beer
a
million
times
and
it
never
gets
old
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
has
different
qualities
that
you
dont
find
in
other
beers
pretty
tasty
have
to
thank
dave
for
this
one
pours
brown
with
not
much
light
getting
through
head
was
off
white
and
went
away
but
laced
a
little
smells
malty
with
no
hop
tastes
nice
and
malty
with
some
english
hop
starts
sweet
and
ends
semidry
not
bad
id
take
another
if
offered
o
would
definitely
drink
this
again
a
big
winner
for
this
beer
and
sadly
not
available
back
home
well
crafted
mvery
drinkable
with
nice
sweet
beginning
and
changing
for
a
little
bittersweetness
o
no
off
flavors
but
theres
nothing
special
about
it
either
i
cant
help
but
think
that
this
is
a
very
safe
interpretation
of
the
style
i
got
it
as
part
of
a
real
ale
sampler
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
overall
id
say
its
ok
i
am
not
really
disappointed
but
it
doesnt
really
excite
me
either
i
got
it
as
part
of
the
sampler
pack
and
i
dont
regret
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
really
buy
a
sixer
of
this
on
its
own
unless
there
wasnt
really
anything
else
to
drink
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
that
isnt
too
sweet
it
plays
everything
safe
mostly
but
still
has
an
interesting
taste
i
have
no
real
complaints
except
of
the
slightly
oxidized
character
id
buy
it
again
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
really
enjoy
the
full
flavor
and
dont
get
to
drink
to
many
browns
in
the
pnw
so
am
really
enjoying
this
well
made
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
full
bodied
and
slightly
complex
because
its
slightly
creamy
with
a
bitter
finish
well
done
overall
thanks
depechemode1983
for
the
trade
happy
to
get
to
try
a
good
brown
ale
that
isnt
available
in
my
area
o
i
liked
this
brew
good
balance
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
would
definately
try
this
brew
again
overall
drinkability
mild
astringency
stomps
all
over
any
delicacy
this
mild
beer
attempts
to
convey
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
though
i
do
find
it
to
be
more
watery
than
i
would
like
also
note
that
this
brew
will
probably
be
extremely
difficult
to
find
outside
of
texasi
only
found
it
near
the
san
antonio
area
while
visiting
my
parents
pours
opaque
brown
with
translucency
around
the
edges
with
around
1
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
to
leave
a
foamy
ring
no
lacing
nose
is
almost
nonexistent
deep
breaths
bring
about
tiny
amounts
of
coffee
notes
taste
is
slightly
toasty
and
coffeey
not
very
complex
but
also
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
actually
it
isnt
too
thin
or
dense
another
easy
drinker
by
real
ale
m
rather
good
straight
from
the
bottle
smooth
refreshing

not
overbearing

is
very
dark
mahogany
in
color
a
bit
cloudy
with
fairly
small
light
brown
head
low
carbonation
aroma
is
malty
reminds
me
of
some
baked
chocolate
dessert
taste
is
milder
than
aroma
still
chocolate
maybe
a
bit
of
coffee
and
nuts
as
well
some
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
too
much
for
my
taste
still
fairly
mild
and
very
drinkable
malts
and
hops
seem
to
diverge
at
the
end
overall
pretty
good
lots
of
nice
toasty
reddish
malts
light
hops
little
sweet
and
sticky
but
nice
drinkable
conclusion
this
beer
isnt
trying
to
blow
anybodys
mind
in
any
way
it
isnt
extreme
or
pretentious
it
is
simply
tasty
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
for
that
i
love
it
if
i
lived
in
texas
this
would
be
one
of
my
cornerstone
fall
and
winter
session
ales
o
mmm
ok
not
impressed
overalldefinitely
my
favorite
out
of
the
3
real
ales
in
the
sampler
pack
would
pick
up
a
6
pack
of
this
over
many
others
and
at
a
cheaper
price
pretty
good
brew
overall
a
decent
effort
by
real
ale
but
not
my
favorite
from
them
if
youre
ever
in
south
texas
i
recommend
real
ales
full
moon
pale
rye
ale
and
this
would
make
a
decent
maltier
companion
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
little
lace
and
poor
head
retention
light
coffee
aroma
malty
middle
and
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
on
the
dry
side
with
a
medium
body
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
mediumlight
carbonation
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
but
not
bad
overall
a
very
truetothestyle
brown
ale
not
the
best
out
there
but
there
is
certainly
worse
out
there
and
worse
for
more
money
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
one
i
could
drink
all
day
enjoyable
beer
and
above
the
average
for
its
class
i
love
getting
new
to
me
beers
like
this
as
extras
drinkability
was
pretty
good
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
certainly
much
better
than
your
typical
bmc
pours
a
dark
mocha
brown
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
roasted
malt
with
caramel
and
not
much
else
to
speak
of
taste
is
nice
with
some
sweet
caramel
up
front
and
a
nice
toasty
finish
with
hints
of
coffee
mouth
is
a
little
too
carbonated
and
slippery
for
me
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
was
a
pleasant
surprise
d
decent
drinker
quite
good
for
a
small
texas
brewery
in
a
beer
starved
state
43

d
quite
drinkable
nice
and
tasty
d
man
this
beer
was
weird
to
me
it
has
a
really
nice
appearance
and
smell
it
also
opened
up
nicely
but
finished
terribly
this
bottle
was
best
by
3611
so
i
wonder
if
age
had
something
to
do
with
this
either
way
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
it
again
i
got
this
in
the
real
ale
sample
pack
and
it
was
the
3rd
of
the
3
that
i
tried
and
midway
though
the
glass
its
my
favorite
of
the
3
poured
slowly
into
a
glass
and
had
a
small
head
that
went
away
fairly
quick
i
was
expecting
something
similar
to
a
newcastle
but
this
is
much
different
than
i
was
expecting
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
chocolaty
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
stout
with
the
deep
chocolate
smell
and
flavor
somewhat
like
a
guinness
actually
my
favorite
beer
from
real
ale
so
far
overall
damn
decent
drinkability
couples
good
d
although
browns
are
not
my
favorite
style
this
one
was
good
enough
that
i
didnt
know
where
the
beer
actually
went
not
bad
real
ale
not
bad
drinkability
sure
yeah
i
guess
but
its
one
and
done
for
me
on
this
one
brewhouse
brown
ale
is
a
beer
that
i
got
in
a
sampler
pack
from
real
ale
the
age
on
this
beer
is
fairly
good
the
color
is
obviosuly
brown
with
a
hint
of
reddish
hue
it
tastes
relatively
average
but
good
none
the
less
it
tastes
like
a
mild
dark
beer
with
a
moderate
hops
flavor
which
reminders
me
of
a
cross
between
zeigenbock
and
shiner
i
recommend
this
as
a
once
in
a
while
beer
it
isnt
anything
special
but
still
pretty
good
not
bad
but
had
better
im
curious
as
to
how
the
rest
of
the
real
ales
taste
like
an
average
brown
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
bit
below
average
drinkability
is
good
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
i
really
liked
the
roasty
nuttiness
it
brought
with
it
and
thought
that
supported
the
caramel
sweetness
nicely
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
dvery
smoothi
consider
this
as
one
of
those
types
of
brew
you
chill
out
with
watching
some
good
football
gamescheers
to
all
honestly
this
beer
is
nice
a
fine
example
of
the
style
but
its
a
little
boring
compared
to
some
of
the
other
browns
ive
had
loved
however
id
get
it
over
nonlocal
boring
browns
like
newcastle
just
cause
i
like
supporting
the
locals
its
a
solid
brown
overall
a
fairly
average
brown
nothing
to
special
or
out
of
the
ordinary
somewhat
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
good
in
addition
to
the
caramel
and
toffee
i
also
get
some
earthy
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
coffee
i
dont
get
any
coffee
in
the
flavor
but
it
was
replaced
by
chocolate
which
is
a
welcome
surprise
the
flavor
also
has
some
caramel
and
earthy
hops
lightly
toasted
malt
the
beer
has
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
great
brown
ale
pours
a
pretty
clear
brown
color
with
a
slightly
reddish
tinge
the
head
is
small
and
is
tan
nutty
malt
aroma
in
the
nose
but
not
really
a
whole
lot
more
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
slightly
bitter
end
lightmedium
mouthfeel
prety
dry
finish
a
fairly
ordinary
beer
that
somewhat
reminds
me
of
a
homebrew
d
wellconstructed
beer
with
good
flavor
profile
goes
down
easy
and
would
be
very
sessionable
overall
i
was
satisfied
with
this
beer
and
i
think
its
on
the
better
end
of
average
for
the
style
im
not
sure
if
i
would
purchase
a
6er
however
i
would
happily
order
it
again
at
a
bar
i
dont
know
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
strikes
me
as
cookiecutter
brown
ale
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
and
it
literlly
tastes
like
pretty
much
every
other
decent
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
guess
and
once
upon
a
time
i
was
a
fan
of
newcastle
brown
ale
but
these
days
there
are
just
so
many
other
interesting
options
out
there
mehhhh
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
nothing
exciting
but
drinkable
d
drinks
easy
and
is
pretty
good
just
nothing
spectacular
id
live
more
roast
and
body
but
this
is
pretty
good
very
good
beer
overall
not
outstanding
and
neither
my
favorite
brown
nor
my
favorite
beer
from
real
ale
but
not
one
id
turn
away
i
could
see
really
being
in
the
mood
for
this
one
strong
flavors
decent
moutfeel
and
a
delicious
aroma
combine
for
an
easily
drinkable
nicely
sessionable
brew
mouthfeel
is
less
carbonated
than
i
would
like
but
still
a
decent
brown
its
good
but
the
flavor
on
the
tongue
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
cheers
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
brown
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
effort
worth
a
shot
overall
a
tasty
brown
if
browns
are
your
thing
oi
have
nothing
against
them
i
just
would
rather
drink
others
beers
with
more
flavor
drinkability
highly
sessionable
with
a
relatively
full
flavor
try
it
while
id
choose
other
beers
over
this
its
pretty
good
overall
nothing
too
spectacular
or
special
id
probably
reach
for
a
newcastle
over
this
but
they
are
pretty
close
perhaps
ill
give
it
another
shot
as
my
tastes
and
palette
expands
tm
very
balanced
slight
tealike
tannins
coffee
like
bitterness
in
the
end
very
smooth
light
carbonation
medium
finish
medium
body
d
serves
its
purpose
for
a
deep
ale
fairly
filling
ive
almost
forgotten
how
good
this
beer
is
since
i
havent
had
it
in
such
a
long
time
ill
have
to
slide
this
into
rotation
again
heres
to
many
more
years
of
drinking
this
special
beer
worth
tracking
down
by
the
caseload
this
beer
is
decent
but
not
exactly
my
type
worth
a
try
pours
with
a
dark
brown
color
minimal
head
and
a
semitransparent
body
has
a
mainly
malty
smell
with
a
smidge
of
chocolate
taste
was
very
clean
although
it
was
a
darker
ale
and
hard
dark
qualities
it
had
a
nice
crisp
finish
wasnt
overpowering
or
too
bitter
it
was
a
nice
balance
compared
to
other
english
brown
ales
ive
had
im
not
a
big
fan
of
english
brown
ale
but
this
is
an
especially
tasty
and
drinkable
example
of
the
style
an
average
brown
ale
a
bit
thin
in
texture
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
in
the
nose
and
flavor
both
thanks
exiled
as
is
its
an
ok
beer
im
sure
its
much
better
when
its
not
expired
d
its
a
decent
english
brown
that
can
be
enjoyed
for
a
few
servings
with
friends
pours
a
redish
brown
with
minimal
head
that
fades
away
to
very
spotty
lace
and
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
across
the
top
smells
of
malts
molasses
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
it
has
a
slight
astringency
in
the
nose
as
well
which
unfortunately
does
appear
in
the
flavor
as
well
has
a
hearty
brown
ale
malt
taste
to
it
with
a
cloying
sweetness
there
is
slight
oxidation
and
astringency
and
sort
of
an
off
chemical
flavor
to
it
as
well
the
chemical
taste
really
stays
throughout
the
finish
and
into
the
aftertaste
i
cant
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
brown
ale
its
got
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
that
chemical
thing
thats
going
on
sort
of
kills
it
for
me
m
another
well
done
ale
from
real
ale
brewing
company
i
could
have
drank
much
more
than
the
two
of
these
that
i
had
this
could
be
a
super
sessionable
brown
if
it
werent
for
the
wateriness
taste
gets
much
better
as
a
nice
smooth
cocoa
flavor
comes
out
and
is
complimented
well
by
a
decent
amount
of
citrus
hops
makes
it
more
than
just
a
onedimensional
brown
if
not
exactly
complex
it
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
bodywise
and
the
flavors
do
feel
a
bit
muted
but
what
is
there
is
pretty
tasty
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
that
i
would
not
mind
trying
on
tap
d
this
is
the
best
beer
out
of
the
real
ale
sample
i
could
definitely
drink
six
of
these
decent
atmosphere
pretty
nice
appearance
and
a
subtle
but
full
nose
flavor
is
also
fairly
basic
but
full
and
hearty
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
d
this
is
a
basic
brown
there
is
nothing
earthshattering
here
i
like
to
keep
it
on
hand
though
it
is
a
respectable
beer
that
can
be
had
in
bunches
and
enjoyed
by
all
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
and
is
fairly
light
on
the
mouth
i
would
recommend
a
little
bit
of
a
higher
temp
so
the
flavor
comes
through
an
above
average
offering
but
i
could
use
a
little
more
verdict
brewhouse
brown
is
a
tasty
but
thoroughly
middleoftheroad
brown
ale
like
the
other
real
ale
brews
ive
tried
so
far
this
is
drinkable
and
true
to
style
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
forgettable
d
overall
its
an
average
beer
it
is
pleasant
to
drink
yet
there
does
seem
to
be
something
missing
from
the
beer
maybe
its
just
that
special
pizzazz
that
remains
nameless
d
if
the
hops
were
dialed
down
a
touch
id
drink
a
lot
more
good
beer
has
a
light
nut
smell
to
it
taste
brings
that
scent
along
with
a
nutty
taste
that
mellows
to
a
sweet
malted
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
in
carbonation
and
the
consistency
is
a
nice
balance
all
around
decent
brown
ale
here
i
think
that
i
enjoyed
the
hop
profile
of
this
the
most
as
it
played
nicely
off
the
roasted
notes
another
solid
brew
from
real
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
quickly
disappearing
white
head
sweet
smelling
caramellike
a
bit
of
earthy
metal
like
hops
in
there
too
but
the
malt
smells
dominate
sweet
caramel
flavors
mild
hop
bitterness
and
maybe
a
bit
of
roasted
flavor
not
at
all
cloying
very
well
balanced
paired
real
well
with
grilled
sausage
and
onions
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
with
fluffy
tan
colored
head
sweet
roasted
malt
mixed
with
a
nutty
fruity
aroma
also
some
earthy
hop
a
good
nutty
roasted
malt
flavor
it
starts
a
little
sweet
and
then
bitters
out
towards
the
end
there
are
some
earthy
hop
flavors
going
on
also
but
they
are
masked
by
the
roasted
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
i
noticed
a
slight
tang
and
that
is
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
about
the
beer
otherwise
its
ok
nothing
too
phenomenal
about
the
flavor
on
this
one
but
its
solid
for
the
style
a
light
peppery
caramel
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
starts
things
off
giving
way
to
a
thinbodied
finish
of
earthen
hops
and
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
has
a
hard
time
making
up
its
mind
switching
from
refreshingly
juicy
and
bubbly
at
first
to
dry
and
thin
on
the
finish
still
real
ale
has
crafted
a
tasty
drinkable
brown
ale
with
this
one
they
definitely
have
the
talent
to
take
on
more
exotic
styles
and
bigger
beers
now
if
only
theyd
employ
that
strategy
would
be
a
great
sessional
overall
impression
decent
session
beer
nothing
to
go
to
far
out
of
your
way
for
i
just
remembered
why
i
dont
like
browns
the
mouth
smacking
mediocrity
there
just
isnt
much
going
on
at
all
with
this
beer
outside
the
look
its
just
a
stripped
down
beer
no
sweetness
no
bitterness
little
malt
little
hop
its
smooth
and
drinkable
quaffing
this
thing
may
be
all
its
useful
for
outside
of
looking
at
it
but
now
im
upset
that
it
looked
so
good
only
to
be
so
lackluster
overall
impression
pretty
straightforward
brown
ale
but
that
sour
flavor
and
smell
was
a
bit
weird
theres
a
little
roughness
to
this
brown
nonetheless
it
is
easy
going
not
much
trouble
really
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
in
a
bottle
i
regularly
have
had
it
fresh
on
draft
and
it
is
way
better
the
drink
by
date
is
expired
by
11
dates
so
maybe
thats
a
reason
still
a
good
tasting
brown
ale
this
brew
pours
up
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
the
nose
is
very
faint
i
get
very
clean
lager
smelling
malts
a
bit
nutty
too
the
taste
is
nutty
subtle
malts
nice
hop
balance
medium
to
light
bodied
low
to
medium
carbo
a
decent
session
brew
i
think
thats
enough
theres
apparently
something
about
the
yeast
or
the
water
or
the
process
of
this
brewery
that
i
just
dont
care
for
no
more
for
me
thanks
thanks
bryan
bigbry
for
sending
this
clear
brownburgandy
color
thin
tan
foam
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
a
little
nutty
and
earthy
and
maybe
just
a
little
chocolate
but
mostly
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
lots
of
roasted
malt
character
which
gives
more
bitterness
than
the
hops
if
im
not
mistaken
a
seriously
drinkable
brown
ale
but
not
exactly
rich
or
deep
not
that
the
style
requires
these
characteristics
a
good
representation
of
a
style
i
dont
usually
prefer
fairly
drinkable
nothing
special
but
not
bad
either
pours
a
respectable
medium
brown
thin
whitish
head
disappears
quickly
leaving
no
lace
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
good
malt
body
good
balance
with
clean
finish
nice
and
mild
brown
excellent
session
beer
and
good

cheers2beers
real
ale
is
ready
to
explode
and
its
because
of
quality
beers
such
as
this
one
drinkable
sure
if
youre
looking
for
a
dark
beer
that
is
lighter
on
the
tastebuds
got
this
one
in
a
sample
pack
and
its
the
first
ive
tried
hopefully
the
rye
ale
and
pale
are
a
better
representation
of
what
this
place
can
brew
12
ounce
bottle
this
is
good
session
ale
regardless
of
the
weather
great
flavor
and
awesome
drinkability
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
tried
this
local
beer
i
need
to
put
it
back
in
rotation
deep

a
thin

lasting

taste
is
much
the

with

coming
in

it

poured

at

house
color
is
dark

thin

and
alluring
look
smells
of

nuts
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
thin
but
good
tastes
of
slight
nuts
malty
mildly
sweet
very
little
hops
in
this
brew
overall
a
decent
beer
i
would
have
another
one
ps
the
current
brewery
looks
just
like
this
label
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
with
a
pop
top
cap
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
clear
brown
in
hue
with
a
shinny
ruby
highlight
it
is
a
lovely
color
the
head
was
light
beige
and
very
bubbly
like
a
cola
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
two
fingers
in
height
and
then
it
faded
fairly
quickly
to
a
fizzy
cap
this
cap
lasted
forever
however
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
overall
the
appearance
is
solid
i
mean
it
is
just
a
brown
ale
what
do
you
expect
beer
porn
the
nose
is
fruity
and
slightly
acidic
from
the
roasted
malts
i
assume
largely
clean
with
some
modest
earthy
nutty
notes
i
also
detect
a
kiss
of
herbalness
the
nose
has
poor
potency
and
it
fails
to
be
articulate
what
a
shame
dammit
speak
up
and
say
something
the
palate
is
very
nice
unlike
the
nose
the
taste
is
clearly
brown
ale
in
nature
i
love
the
style
and
this
one
has
all
the
proper
flavors
fruity
with
sharp
acidity
from
a
healthy
roast
the
malt
is
like
a
small
porter
slightly
nutty
clean
it
could
use
a
little
yeasty
residue
the
hops
offer
slight
bitterness
and
some
earthiness
the
palate
is
tasty
and
it
is
puttogether
nicely
long
aftertaste
it
would
be
a
good
beer
with
a
steak
or
stew
medium
in
body
with
firm
carbonation
helps
produce
a
sturdy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
drinkable
id
sit
back
and
quaff
a
sixpack
anytime
anyplace
it
is
a
good
session
beer
plenty
simple
i
realize
this
beer
isnt
earth
shattering
but
i
like
the
style
and
this
beer
is
decent
thanks
bdc
for
the
bottle
worth
a
try
this
is
yet
another
solid
beer
from
real
ale
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
but
clean
medium
heavy
with
some
carbonation
keeping
it
from
getting
too
thick
above
average
for
the
style
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
drinkability
very
drinkable
except
that
after
one
or
two
i
think
i
would
start
craving
something
more
interesting
like
beer
from
many
small
regional
breweries
this
is
a
fine
well
crafted
beer
it
just
isnt
that
exciting
groundbreaking
or
extraordinary
but
a
boring
craft
brew
beats
the
pants
off
of
just
about
any
american
macro
nice
flavor
slightly
sweet
with
a
fairly
pleasant
malty
flavor
giving
notes
of
berries
and
roasted
malts
not
offensive
drinkability
a
well
crafted
beer
easy
to
drink
for
me
but
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
english
brown
ale
still
i
think
there
is
room
for
improvement
with
this
particular
beer
a
dark
dark
brown
beer

nuttiness

dark
cocoa
up
front
turns
thinnish
through
the
top
some
nice
chocolate
malt
goes
tangy
for
the
roasty
nutty
bitter
chocolate
toffee
finish
its
just
a
nice
tasty
roasty
chocolatey
brown
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
maybe
not
complex
enough
to
be
a
great
beer
brewhouse
brown
pours
a
nice
dark
color
with
dark
ruby
highlights
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
but
not
too
strong
the
starts
moderately
sweet
and
ends
with
some
hops
bite
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
again
but
too
many
in
a
row
would
be
a
little
too
filling
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
other
real
ale
company
offerings
taste
like
the
letdown
here
was
the
mouthfeel
the
beer
felt
way
too
thin
on
the
palette
with
an
empty
feeling
that
grew
with
each
sip
this
was
a
real
downer
as
the
taste
had
the
beginnings
of
a
good
beer
in
the
end
the
watery
mouthfeel
became
the
most
dominant
character
as
a
result
of
the
light
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
was
up
front
and
not
well
hidden
i
wish
that
they
had
worked
on
the
recopied
a
bit
more
to
get
some
more
malts
in
the
bottle
pours
a
dark
brownish
mahogany
color
with
a
short
light
tan
head
that
soon
fades
into
a
tight
lace
nose
is
chocolaty
roasted
malts
and
fresh
mocha
moderate
in
body
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
gives
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
crisp
mouthfeel
taste
picks
up
right
where
the
aroma
left
off
with
the
same
chocolaty
malts
as
well
as
a
bit
of
burnt
caramel
and
dark
fruit
some
unusual
though
not
unpleasant
earthy
mineral
notes
follow
along
with
some
mildly
bitter
hops
leaving
a
dry
finish
a
pretty
nice
brown
ale
that
needs
to
make
its
way
up
to
north
texas
thanks
to
bentley
for
the
sample
good
mouthfeel
the
initial
sample
seemed
to
be
a
bit
watery
but
this
sample
is
holding
up
better
good
smooth
finish
very
drinkable
not
quite
as
good
overall
as
the
other
real
ale
offerings
but
certainly
not
a
disappointment
in
any
way
good
stuff
its
hazy
mahogany
body
is
topped
by
a
light
tan
head
of
foam
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
jagged
and
craggy
rings
of
lace
at
the
outset
the
nose
is
yeasty
and
fruity
above
a
mildly
caramelish
and
nutty
malt
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
its
very
fine
natural
carbonation
is
lightly
zesty
in
the
mouth
chocolate
and
caramel
mingle
well
together
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
slight
fruitiness
a
light
yeast
bite
and
some
leafy
hops
its
well
balanced
by
a
lowkey
bitterness
and
it
finishes
short
and
dry
with
just
some
residual
nutty
malt
this
is
probably
quite
excellent
in
cask
conditioned
form
but
it
seems
to
fall
a
bit
short
in
the
bottle
rerevisited
im
liking
the
beer
more
and
more
each
time
i
try
it
the
mouthfeel
has
a
fairly
creamy
profile
and
the
taste
has
some
nuttiness
that
i
didnt
get
before
im
not
sure
if
they
are
playing
with
the
recipe
or
im
just
starting
to
pick
up
on
subtle
notes
thanks
kbub
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
there
is
a
thick
and
long
lived
head
with
a
moderate
malt
nose
the
flavor
is
a
well
balanced
blend
of
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfell
is
fair
and
smooth
but
not
exceptional
in
any
way
the
after
taste
is
fairly
decent
and
not
too
bitter
overall
a
better
brew
from
this
brew
house
id
like
a
touch
more
body
from
this
beer
as
several
consecutive
sips
resulted
in
my
mouth
frowning
over
the
slight
but
building
thinness
still
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
the
modest
subtlety
and
the
balance
in
this
beer
of
all
the
standard
real
ale
offerings
this
one
might
be
the
most
solid
pretty
good
dark
beer
recommend
this
one
as
a
good
sample
from
this
brewery
dark
brown
with
an
ok
head
that
fades
quickly
arome
is
nice
and
dark
with
a
hint
of
citric
hops
a
bit
like
cocoa
puff
and
grapefruit
juice
the
hops
fall
out
in
the
flavor
but
it
picks
up
a
nice
earthy
malt
a
bit
chalky
in
the
flavor
solid
brown
ale
drink
it
had
a
16
keg
of
this
and
is
very
crisp
and
drinkable
just
a
good
solid
brown
ale
overall
a
really
good
beer
from
legend
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
had
my
first
one
of
these
15
years
ago
and
its
still
one
of
my
go
to
beers
love
it
in
the
bottle
and
adore
it
on
tap
its
better
ontap
than
out
of
the
bottle
but
it
still
isnt
the
best
ale
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
still
id
order
it
again
if
i
absolutely
had
to
drink
something
i
knew
was
decent
and
if
i
wasnt
in
the
mood
for
untested
beers
outstanding
nice
upfront
caramel
flavor
roasty
light
eric
o
this
beer
is
rather
malty
but
its
lighter
mouthfeel
doesnt
make
it
seem
heavy
or
filling
and
is
therefore
relatively
easy
to
drink
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
nothing
outstanding
but
i
am
always
happy
to
see
it
on
a
menu
surprising
balanced
and
very
drinkable
very
pleasant
color
and
very
nice
thick
head
from
tap
caramel
nutty
and
sweet
notes
hops
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
like
so
many
microbrews
low
on
the
ibu
scale
the
beer
was
good
enough
for
me
to
take
the
time
to
review
it
which
is
saying
something
as
i
have
never
reviewed
a
beer
before
at
least
not
publicly
now
back
to
drinking
i
will
definitely
be
having
another
one
cheers
overall
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
o
quite
nice
brown
ale
very
balanced
great
rich
flavors
and
the
crisp
finish
really
plays
off
the
richness
well
pours
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
hues
a
thick
2inch
tan
head
with
lots
of
staying
power
the
smell
is
surprisingly
hoppy
and
brisk
the
taste
is
an
interesting
blend
of
the
hops
and
malts
citrusgrapefruit
nutty
a
little
bitter
after
taste
more
in
line
with
a
mild
ipa
but
still
a
very
good
on
the
palate
dry
and
high
carbonation
mouthfeel
overall
although
the
taste
aroma
and
mouthfeel
dont
track
with
most
brown
ales
this
brew
is
very
good
and
enjoyable
a
decent
beer
overall
but
far
from
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
ever
tried
overall
impression
a
solid
american
brown
ale
it
seemed
to
bitter
to
be
an
english
brown
even
though
thats
where
its
slotted
here
id
try
it
again
but
in
general
browns
dont
get
me
too
excited
clear
deep
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
topped
by
a
thin
beige
cap
good
head
retention
some
lacing
not
much
other
than
grapefruit
citrus
in
the
aroma
perhaps
a
bit
of
malt
and
brown
sugar
moderate
bitterness
citrus
dominates
the
flavour
fainter
notes
of
dark
malts
nuts
and
brown
sugar
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
dry
decent
overall
particularly
if
you
like
a
lot
of
citrus
in
your
brown
ales
pretty
decent
brew
nothing
amazing
but
its
satisfying
and
refreshing
i
would
try
it
again
o
an
easy
drinker
and
a
good
version
of
the
style
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
brown
ale
nicely
balanced
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
ill
certainly
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
odecent
if
not
great
brown
ale
easy
drinking
edit
as
i
have
a
bomber
and
a
tiny
glass
it
has
taken
several
refills
and
each
refill
has
caused
it
to
try
to
overflow
with
head
while
the
beer
part
stays
in
the
bottom
inch
or
so
of
the
glass
this
coupled
with
some
other
things
that
came
out
as
i
drink
make
me
wonder
if
theres
something
up
with
this
bottle
i
admittedly
dont
know
much
about
what
can
affect
a
beerwhat
effect
it
can
have
is
this
a
possibility
overall
sort
of
missing
the
nutty
character
and
malt
depth
but
its
not
a
bad
brew
though
and
certainly
not
a
horrible
brown
thats
for
sure
our
most
popular
beer
legends
is
a
full
bodied

of
a

is
wonderful
find
this
beer
and
bring
it
home
just
wonderful
happy
brewing
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
bit
nutty
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
and
malts
a
bit
of
nuts
just
a
touch
of
caramel
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
o
i
admit
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
a
bit
aromatically
its
not
much
cop
but
the
flavor
and
texture
helps
compensate
very
good
in
general
o
enjoyable
ale
that
does
not
overwhelm
taste
is
sweet
yet
subtle
at
the
end
o
i
like
this
one
the
sour
tangy
flavor
is
hard
to
place
but
it
plays
well
with
the
nuttiness
and
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
drinkability
is
ok
a
little
to
much
like
a
milky
way
candy
bar
for
my
taste
i
tired
of
the
sweetness
quickly
the
fairly
high
abv
is
well
hidden
though
overall
a
fairly
average
brown
ale
a
bit
of
a
sentimental
favorite
because
its
semilocal
and
definitely
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
pours
mostly
clear
ruby
with
a
beige
thin
head
that
has
some
retention
and
little
lacing
medium
to
light
in

smooth
finishes
with
lasting
pine
bitterness
taste
and
smell
rounded
out
by
sweet
bready
cookie
dough
with
a

d

with
a

but
could
use
more
intensity
in
the
taste
overall
very
easy
drinking
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
overall
a
very
good
brew
but
due
to
its
heaviness
couldnt
see
having
more

at
one
sitting
pours

notes

of
the
more
appetizing
aromas
for
a
brown
ale
that
i
have
come
across
praline
flavors
are
very
nice
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
pricklyin
saying
that
the
flavors
are
still
pretty
rich
and
satisying
the
abv
is
high
for
the
style
but
its
very
well
hiddena
solid
offering
from
legend
overall
not
a
very
exciting
style
but
this
beer
makes
the
most
of
it
overall
a
drinkable
very
decent
brown
ale
wont
knowck
you
socks
off
but
definitely
not
bad
overall
a
very
nice
brown
ale
would
buy
again
overall
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
i
didnt
enjoy
o
this
is
definitely
legends
most
popular
beer
and
with
good
reason
its
very
well
rounded
with
a
pleasant
flavor
aroma
and
smooth
mouthfeel
having
just
consumed
one
bottle
i
am
left
wanting
to
have
another
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
offering
from
legend
brewing
and
certainly
one
of
the
top
examples
of
the
style
big
thanks
goes
out
to
the
ba
who
sent
this
one
my
way
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
cant
remember
who
but
will
look
it
up
soon
served
from
bottle
into
a
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
five
to
six
finger
cream
colored
head
that
subsided
to
three
finger
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
subtly
roasted
malt
nutty
earth
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
tart
caramel
nutty
and
wood
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
i
was
concerned
that
this
one
was
going
to
be
infected
based
on
the
amount
of
head
that
formed
upon
being
poured
gently
into
my
glass
upon
smelling
the
brew
it
didnt
seem
like
there
was
any
infection
evident
but
on
the
flavor
there
was
the
slight
tart
note
that
one
would
not
expect
it
was
not
sharp
or
strong
but
it
was
definitely
present
still
a
fairly
easy
drinking
brown
ale
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
sometime
the
body
is
a
perfect
medium
for
me
its
light
enough
to
give
it
great
drinkability
yet
heavy
enough
to
let
you
know
youre
not
drinking
a
lite
beer
carbonation
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
headed
towards
moderate
i
really
think
this
beer
stands
out
as
a
favorite
brown
ale
overall
decent
but
not
impressive
enough
to
ask
for
another
got
as
an
extra
and
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
enjoy
overall
a
very
good
beer
for
its
style
and
an
excellent
session
brew
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
o
light
flavor
and
body
makes
this
a
rather
drinkable
ale
but
the
aroma
is
slightly
off
and
in
the
end
this
one
is
just
not
very
interesting
overallvery
drinkable
creamy
and
lightly
sweet
not
especially
flavorful
but
hard
not
to
get
along
with
o
not
bad
but
at
the
same
time
fairly
meh
overall
a
mild
tasting
and
well
balanced
brown
ale
that
possessed
an
excellent
drinkability
o
i
have
to
say
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
legend
brewing
co
as
a
richmond
local
and
a
lover
of
brown
ales
this
beer
has
been
a
favorite
of
mine
for
a
long
time
make
sure
to
try
the
porter
if
you
have
the
chance
4
0
overall
a
really
good
brown
ale
that
im
glad
to
have
gotten
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
that
id
definitely
like
to
enjoy
again
all
in
all
im
definitely
impressed
im
not
a
big
brown
fan
but
this
one
has
enough
malt
carachter
and
a
touch
of
hops
that
it
really
works
while
keeping
things
interesting
id
drink
this
by
the
growler
if
it
were
local
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
this
is
a
little
above
average
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
i
dont
find
it
legendary
o
good
beer
very
drinkable
still
not
especially
compelling
would
drink
again
in
the
right
circumstance
recommended
pours
the
color
of
root
beer
good
head
that
settles
slowly
plenty
of
malt
in
the
nose
good
sweetness
too
perhaps
caramel
taste
up
front
is
strong
perhaps
a
little
coffee
and
chocolate
the
ending
is
sweeter
but
finishes
just
right
there
is
a
small
taste
of
hops
for
balance
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
but
fits
with
the
style
this
is
quite
a
surprise
from
an
instate
brewery
never
tried
any
of
their
stuff
before
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
tried
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
tried
it
with
a
margarita
pizza
and
the
beer
complemented
the
basil
and
olive
oil
tastes
i
would
have
this
beer
again
when
in
va
pours
a
lightly
hazed
brown
with
moderate
cap
of
off
white
foam
scent
is
wonderfully
nutty
with
light
touches
of
caramel
and
roast
mild
earthy
hoppyness
with
a
kick
of
herbal
scent
taste
follows
scent
slightly
less
aggressive
then
the
nose
would
lead
to
believe
medium
bodied
lightly
creamy
but
a
faint
bit
of
wateriness
and
the
carbonation
escapes
a
nice
brown
ale
with
a
good
chunk
of
different
scents
and
tastes
still
its
a
better
than
average
example
of
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
an
amazing
e
brown
i
could
live
on
this
beer
really
o
for
being
a
local
beer
this
one
stands
up
with
most
any
brown
that
ive
had
drinkability
this
was
a
tasty
wellbalanced
brown
ale
but
certainly
was
not
best
of
breed
it
was
easy
to
drink
could
be
consumed
all
night
long
and
was
a
reasonable
value
even
at
the
restaurants
sizable
markup
id
order
it
again
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
serve
it
to
friends
o
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
brewers
craft
this
one
more
towards
the
entree
bread
dough
side
as
apposed
to
the
candy
sugary
one
this
was
a
different
kind
of
brown
ale
for
sure
good
stuff
hv
brown
in
color
nutty
rich
aroma
with
a
good
half
inch
of
head
good
carbonation
and
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
nutty
aroma
carries
over
to
the
flavor
robust
flavor
youd
expect
from
a
brown
ale
but
finishes
mild
just
shy
of
bitter
but
not
sweet
very
well
balanced
i
had
it
on
the
recommendation
a
bartender
on
tap
a
while
back
and
had
to
look
for
at
my
local
total
wine
great
beer
i
took
a
six
pack
to
a
friends
and
they
where
a
hit
even
with
the
mgd
die
hards
dark
brown
leaning
toward
amber
12
finger
head
smells
caramely
chocolate
with
some
sweet
tobacco
and
dried
fruit
tastes
sweet
with
a
semisweet
finish
nice
and
malty
with
just
enough
hop
to
bitter
adequate
carbination
and
a
creamy
mouth
feel
pretty
solid
offering
and
quite
drinkable
id
recommend
it
without
any
reservations
overall
this
one
surprised
me
a
bit
researched
legend
brewing
company
before
arriving
being
from
ca
where
it
is
not
distributed
to
my
knowledge
and
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
also
a
plus
that
i
get
to
take
one
of
these
back
to
share
with
friends
at
the
next
tasting
give
this
beer
a
chance
and
itll
be
something
you
regularly
stock
from
here
on
out
this
beer
poured
a
mahogany
brown
and
crystal
clear
with
a
short
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
smell
was
nutty
and
malty
and
although
the
aroma
was
there
it
was
light
and
humble
the
taste
was
spot
on
average
for
a
brown
ale
nutty
and
malty
nothing
to
be
too
impressed
with
but
definitely
better
than
a
newky
brown
light
on
the
body
and
easy
to
sip
this
one
you
can
definitely
drink
a
bottle
or
two
and
not
have
to
worry
about
not
making
the
evening
news
at
10
overall
my
only
issue
with
legends
brown
ale
is
the
carbonation
or
lack
there
of
it
made
for
a
weak
head
and
gave
it
an
oily
feel
in
terms
of
flavor
however
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
so
if
you
are
not
as
sensitive
to
texture
as
i
am
pick
one
of
these
up
next
time
you
find
yourself
in
richmond
va
malterrific
d
very
drinkable
matchs
with
a
lot
of
dishes
a
good
brown
ale
overall
not
amazing
but
good
enough
d
overall
drinkable
while
it
fails
to
break
the
mediocre
barrier
in
all
other
categories
its
refreshing
enough
to
drink
in
quantity
on
a
hot
day
nothing
exceptionally
or
noteworthy
about
this
beer
its
just
a
good
beer
d
if
you
have
a
hankering
for
a
brown
ale
that
brings
some
sugar
to
the
party
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
the
aroma
and
taste
make
it
a
pleasant
experience
i
had
this
beer
in
a
22oz
draft
at
the
quaker
steak
in
newport
news
va
it
was
a
good
beer
nothing
super
special
to
remark
about
but
in
a
town
where
bud
bud
light
and
yeungling
are
the
readily
available
beers
on
draft
would
drink
it
again
if
i
were
looking
for
a
good
brew
that
wouldnt
over
power
my
wings
yet
maintained
a
good
body
and
mouth
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
it
really
had
some
nice
caramel
toffee
and
nutty
flavors
to
it
thumbs
up
overall
a
tasty
and
well
done
brown
ale
d
quite
easy
makes
me
wonder
why
i
had
not
tried
it
sooner
drinkability
is
just
ridiculous
when
you
consider
the
accessible
6

the
bigness
of
the
flavor
and
the
fact
that
none
of
its
characteristics
are
cloying

most

i

until
seeing
it
hear
if
it
were

make

just
watch
yourself
a

will
put
you
in

review
from
notes
taken
on
12509
it
has
a
nice
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
that
sticks
around
not
a

of

a
little

very
thick

roasted

the

with

very
drinkable
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
one
drinkability
a
great
brown
ale
this
beer
is
complex
and
satisfying
its
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
wow
legend
makes
easily
the
best
beer
around
and
this
is
the
go
to
beer
of
their
collection
heavy
but
very
drinkable
great
smell
and
taste
its
very
sam
adams
esque
in
the
quality
but
just
has
better
drinkability
than
most
brown
ales
out
there
the
color
is
a
darkish
brown
and
has
nice
tan
lacing
just
a
fantastic
beer
on
tap
at
the
2nd
street
bistro
in
williamsburg
an
hour
from
the
brewery
so
maybe
that
helps
at
any
rate
the
bartender
described
it
as
kind
of
like
newcastle

a

from

overall
it
was

of
the

ive
had

buttery

of
malts
they
seem
to
diminish
a
touch
in
the

slight
burnt

a

quietly

the

was

this

a

favorite
example
this
is
just
god
awful
my
favorite
new
glarus
brew
great
nutty
brown
ale
stay
close
to
the
restroom
if
your
drinking
these
they
give
my
stomach
a
turn
for
the
worse
maybe
thats
because
i
have
12
of
them
in
1
sitting
i
dont
know
i
tend
to
stay
away
these
days
ng
is
better
known
for
their
fruit
beer
another
delicious
beer
from
new
glarus
i
have
to
admit
i
was
cracking
mixed
nuts
and
eating
them
while
drinking
the
beer
i
felt
corny
doing
that
but
it
was
fun
and
certainly
didnt
hurt
the
flavor
experience
overall
drinkability
a
very
nice
brown
ale
i
had
this
beer
many
years
ago
in
milwaukee
and
seem
to
remember
it
as
more
coffeelike
in
taste
but
that
was
almost
6
years
ago
now
and
my
palate
has
changed
im
still
enjoying
all
the
roasted
malt
flavors
though
went
well
with
food
stuffed
shells
with
cheese
and
butternut
squash
and
i
would
not
mind
having
another
one
but
sadly
i
only
have
the
one
bottle
a
very
good
brown
ale
new
glarus
never
disappoints
a
good
beer
to
sit
by
the
fireplace
with
the
best
overall
another
great
beer
by
new
glarus
definitely
worth
trying
o
i
am
biased
as
this
was
one
of
my
first
craft
beer
loves
but
it
still
gets
the
job
done
years
later
it
really
is
just
a
nice
simple
light
brown
ale
take
a
pale
ale
toast
the
malt
a
touch
and
back
off
the
hops
nostalgia
wins
extra
points
but
it
really
is
just
a
nice
every
day
beer
flavors
are
very
subtle
and
subdued
beer
is
ok
nothing
special
one
the
best
brown
ales
it
had
great
taste
and
feel
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
brown
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
caramel
nice
fruitiness
and
a
hint
of
nuttiness
tastes
of
fruit
with
a
tad
of
nuts
beer
is
light
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
quality
nut
brown
ale
great
toasty
flavors
and
a
rich
warm
flavor
make
this
one
seasonal
i
constantly
crave
year
round
sweet
malty
caramel
smell
light
brown
in
color
with
a
white
head
lots
of
malt
flavor
i
like
the
nuttyness
too
similar
to
fat
tire
but
much
better
at
7
a
six
pack
this
is
great
taste
is
deliciously
nutty
with
a
tinge
of
fruit
peeking
through
a
worldclass
brown
ale
and
one
id
turn
to
again
o
this
is
a
well
made
craft
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
make
this
an
everyday
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
others
give
it
a
try
overall
fairly
nice
it
is
good
but
im
not
sure
where
this
beer
would
fit
in
as
far
as
time
of
year
maybe
best
in
the
fall
id
buy
it
again
but
it
would
sit
in
the
fridge
until
i
was
feeling
squirrelly
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
the
flavors
are
solid
enough
but
the
mouthfeel
leaves
me
wanting
a
bit
more
still
very
drinkable
and
offered
at
a
great
price
overall
pretty
good
but
brown
but
nothing
special
overall
good
brown
ale
nothing
special
but
still
a
solid
beer
that
goes
for
a
good
price
point
brown
ales
fail
to
excite
a
lot
of
the
time
but
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
one
even
if
it
isnt
exciting
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
they
dont
try
to
reinvent
the
style
by
overdoing
hops
so
i
approve
overall
just
a
very
solid
english
brown
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
spot
on
yellows
and
golds
highlighting
this
light
brown
beer
sweet
malts
and
herbal
hops
equally
in
the
nose
thin
mouthfeel
sweet
caramel
flavors
marry
with
a
lighter
taste
wheat
or
maize
perhaps
gives
it
a
tang
reminiscent
of
an
all
american
lager
finishes
on
a
herbal
slightly
resiny
hop
finish
more
body
and
bolder
flavor
would
improve
this
brew
but
its
a
satisfying
and
fun
brew
as
is
oalthough
the
typical
brown
ale
flavors
were
present
they
just
were
strong
enough
or
the
could
have
meshed
better
very
bland
just
ok
again
this
beer
would
be
rated
much
higher
if
it
was
slightly
more
creamy
overall
a
very
enjoyable
tasty
and
drinkable
eba
about
as
good
as
a
brown
i
have
ever
had
the
malt
flavor
is
awesome
o
decent
decent
not
better
than
one
of
my
favorites
avery
ellies
brown
ale
but
still
quite
good
the
roastiness
is
a
bit
too
strong
for
this
type
of
ale
in
my
opinion
and
its
not
quite
sweet
enough
definitely
good
though
o
it
is
okay
i
had
a
great
nut
brown
ale
yesterday
and
it
is
still
in
my
mind
so
this
beer
suffers
a
little
because
of
that
o
im
not
loving
the
yeast
profile
on
this
beer
its
ok
i
sampled
this
beer
at
the
great
taste
of
the
midwest
in
madison
i
think
the
beer
has
a
good
taste
and
afterwards
is
also
nice
its
hard
to
go
wrong
with
any
new
glaurs
product

b
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
ive
tried
i
really
like
the
nutty
flavor
it
has
and
its
made
locally
here
in
wisconsin
ive
been
craving
it
lately
but
i
cant
find
it
on
the
shelves
of
my
liquor
store
anymore
o
pretty
solid
but
not
a
huge
winner
for
me
aroma
and
flavor
profiile
overcame
an
average
mouthfeel
i
admittedly
dont
love
browns
by
my
nature
but
overall
its
a
relatively
pleasing
and
sessionable
worth
a
shot
but
not
close
to
a
staple
this
is
interesting
in
that
it
has
a
neat
nutty
quality
to
it
the
hop
balance
is
very
very
well
done
just
enough
to
be
pleasant
i
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
i
remembered
interesting
brew
the
interplay
of
sourness
and
nuttiness
is
different
oexcellent
example
of
an
english
style
nut
brown
ale
benchmark
for
the
style
pours
brown
with
an
off
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
smells
and
tastes
like
nuts
toasted
malt
biscuit
and
light
caramel
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
worth
seeking
out
again
either
thanks
to
jessica
for
bringing
this
back
from
a
visit
home
it
poured
a
light
brown
with
a
finger
of
head
that
left
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
mild
caramel
with
some
nuttiness
a
mild
aroma
mostly
caramel
i
found
more
flavor
than
nose
caramel
again
was
number
one
followed
by
the
nuttiness
the
finish
has
some
crispness
which
i
liked
nice
mild
creaminess
on
the
mouth
feel
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
and
i
would
drink
it
again
a
solid
brown
ale
but
it
feels
a
little
unrefined
easy
drinking
and
i
definitely
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
offered
a
bottle
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
overall
drinkability
a
refreshing
brown
ale
pour
looks
like
liquid
brown
sugar
with
an
off
white
head
smell
isnt
powerful
but
is
a
nice
toasted
malt
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
malt
flavor
with
some
subtle
sweetness
a
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
and
flavor
balance
overall
a
nice
beer
great
flavor
very
sessionable
overall
this
is
easily
drinkable
but
its
also
kind
of
ordinary
and
bland
not
very
memorable
either
ideally
suited
for
standard
american
pub
fare
ill
happily
welcome
this
semirobust
ale
with
cheeseburgers
chicken
wings
and
hand
tossed
pizzas
its
a
nonoffensive
beer
that
meets
many
occasions
but
might
leave
the
beer
connoisseur
wanting
more
o
a
nice
english
brown
very
true
to
style
and
easy
drinking
a
solid
beer
overall
a
very
solid
version
of
a
brown
ale
dark
and
toasty
taste
with
a
solid
bitter
balance
investigating
the
empty
bottle
i
find
inkjetted
numbers
that
could
be
a
julian
dating
code
if
so
this
beer
was
bottled
almost
3
moths
ago
which
i
dont
consider
old
amazingly
a
somewhat
disappointing
ng
beer
as
good
as
sam
smith
nut
brownmy
standard
yes
o
this
is
a
really
nice
english
brown
ale
it
has
a
wide
breadth
of
malt
aromas
and
flavors
while
maintaining
a
solid
english
hop
presence
this
fits
the
northern
english
brown
ale
style
nearly
to
a
t
really
tasty
and
very
drinkable
so
pumped
that
i
finally
got
to
try
a
beer
from
new
glarus
overallsuper
tasty
this
would
be
a
staple
if
i
could
get
it
around
here
nothing
fancy
but
clean
and
what
i
want
in
the
style
plenty
of
nut
and
malt
and
light
hop
balance
a
nice
autumn
beer
o
a
good
beer
nothing
great
but
i
did
enjoy
it
paired
with
the
right
food
this
beer
would
be
taken
up
a
notch

d
superbly
well
rounded
tasty
and
with
a
great
mouthfeel
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
o
this
is
a
really
well
put
together
brown
ale
i
was
told
this
may
be
replaced
by
black
top
as
a
year
round
brew
from
new
glarus
it
would
be
hard
to
argue
against
that
decision
but
i
hope
this
makes
an
appearance
as
a
seasonal
if
that
in
fact
turns
out
to
be
true
this
is
really
tasty

glad
to
recommend

minimal
frothy

even
with

vigorous

be
seen
clinging
to

consistent
with

along
with
some
mild

taste
is
also
mild
consisting
of
caramel
and
nuts
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
things
out
this
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
yet
unremarkable
brew
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
much
more
if
everything
about
it
was
more
concentratedbolder
flavors
thicker
body
etc
as
it
is
it
makes
for
a
suitable
session
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
a
decent
lighter
brown
ale
it
has
decent
flavor
even
if
a
bit
subdued
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
once
but
ill
probably
seek
a
more
fullflavored

ale
in
the
future

brown
ale
and
as

a

color

most
of
every

aroma
with
only
a
slight

and
bready

noticeable
a
malty
sweetness
begins
and
grows
throughout
with
hints
of
coffee
and
nutty
flavors
cutting
through
the
sweetness
mediumfull
in
body
this
english
brown
ale
is
also
higher
in
carbonation
pairs
well
with
grilled
steaks
o
a
well
made
beer
that
fits
the
brown
ale
style
perfectly
overall
this
a
pretty
great
brown
ale
classic

nutty
character
i
love
the

impeccably
balanced
perhaps
a

this
poured

it

light
fizzy
head
on

that
left
behind
some
film
over

of
the

the
smell

people

overall
i
think
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
average
side
the
other
characteristics
are
good
overall
a
pretty
solid
and
traditional
take
on
an
english
brown
good
stuff
o
very
easy
drink
due
to
body
and
light
sweet
malt
bill
smooth
flavors
from
start
to
finish
unique
beer
overall
very
surprised
about
this
brew
have
always
passed
it
up
in
the
past
but
will
now
definitely
return
to
it
ng
makes
such
great
beers
overall
im
glad
this
tasted
much
better
than
it
smells
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
high
but
still
an
alright
beer
o
good
just
not
crazy
over
nutty
but
really
exceptional
for
the
style
nut
browns
are
an
interesting
style
since
no
nuts
are
present
in
the
grist
but
its
an
acquired
taste
ogood
all
around
brown
ale
i
wish
it
would
show
a
little
more
on
the
nose
but
will
definitely
try
to
find
when
i
am
in
wisconsin
again
o
this
is
still
my
favorite
new
glarus
staple
beer
spotted
cow
is
good
and
all
but
i
think
a
little
on
the
overrated
side
this
ones
an
underdog
that
should
really
be
making
it
on
peoples
top
lists
overall
love
this
because
it
is
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
tastes
great
in
general
but
after
consideration
it
is
a
bit
too
sour
i
still
love
new
glarus
and
they
consistently
deliver
quality
beers
very
tasty
the
malt
is
nice
and
sweet
with
plenty
of
nutty
flavors
going
on
the
hops
add
a
nice
spice
just
a
well
rounded
brown
ale
very
impressed
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
the
title
is
amusing
but
the
beer
is
pleasing
it
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
finger
of
foam
and
plenty
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
light
nutty
and
a
bit
of
malt
its
quite
tasty
with
the
nuttiness
and
caramel
mixing
together
the
body
seems
a
bit
thin
watery
it
goes
down
easy
enough
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
head
that
leaves
thin
layer
of
carbonation
on
top
scents
of
caramel
malts
and
roasted
malts
tickle
the
nose
along
with
some
toffee
hints
the
taste
is
smooth
yet
full
of
flavor
theres
the
sweet
caramel
malts
roasted
hazelnuts
and
other
nutty
flavors
drinks
smooth
and
is
a
great
year
round
beer
but
definetly
would
drink
best
in
the
colder
months
one
of
new
glarus
two
most
famous
beers
along
with
spotted
cow
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
roll
o
overall
a
good
brown
ale
and
another
good
beer
from
new
glarus
lots
of
nuts
in
the
taste
and
some
light
hops
and
easy
to
drink
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
and
this
was
sold
on
the
shelves
id
certainly
have
it
again
overall
pretty
undistinguished
a
nice
enough
ale
but
a
bit
more
prominence
in
the
malt
would
have
rounded
it
out
and
given
a
bit
of
depth
as
it
was
the
beer
was
a
touch
thin
and
leaning
toward
astringent
one
to
go
through
and
then
move
on
to
more
interesting
offerings
o
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
good
flavors
thanks
again
chris
this
beer
has
a
nice
brown
color
body
with
a
2light
brown
head
that
lays
down
pretty
quickly
to
a
think
lace
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
some
nice
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
of
malts
and
carmel
and
is
has
a
nice
nutty
flavor
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
crisp
rolls
off
the
tonuge
nicely
overall
this
is
a
good
tasting
and
well
balanced
beer
o
very
well
balanced
beer
and
the
flavors
were
subtle
but
full
at
the
same
time
great
beer
very
drinkable
delicious
an
excellent
brown
ale
diverse
enough
to
be
interesting
yet
without
too
much
going
on
that
you
feel
you
dont
know
what
youre
drinking
or
that
youre
missing
something
also
seems
like
a
great
session
beer
not
so
malty
you
feel
your
mouth
is
coated
and
balanced
enough
to
easily
have
more
than
one
would
definitely
enjoy
this
in
front
of
a
fire
be
it
indoors
or
out
o
decent
beer
nothing
to
rave
about
nothing
to
complain
about
an
interesting
beer
that
doesnt
wow
me
over
but
its
very
drinkable
pours
translucent
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
very
little
lace
smell
is
earthy
lightly
toasted
malt
and
caramels
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
bitter
light
roasted
malt
biscuits
and
tea
and
a
bit
earthy
mouthfeel
starts
creamy
and
has
good
carbonation
but
seems
watery
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
english
brown
overall
not
the
best
of
the
new
glarus
beers
its
not
bad
but
its
nothing
too
special
for
the
brown
ale
style
and
a
little
too
thin
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
this
actually
makes
me
want
a
tastier
classic
brown
ale
like
samuel
smiths
real
english
brown
ale
m
thin
body
fairly
dry
and
doesnt
linger
too
long
on
the
palate
except
for
a
mild
residual
sweetness
good
carbonation
o
nice
beer
for
an
english
brown
it
has
more
of
a
sweet
side
that
may
attribute
to
my
enjoying
it
more
than
most
english
anythings
slight
nut
flavor
is
very
nice
accent
to
malts
and
carbonation
almost
perfect
great
beer
for
a
fall
day
o
glad
its
avaialable
not
readily
but
still
available
i
enjoyed
and
will
probably
enjoy
another
soon
o
this
brown
ale
borders
on
the
sweet
side
of
the
spectrum
i
found
myself
searching
for
something
to
balance
it
out
but
it
never
did
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
misses
being
an
excellent
beer
by
lack
of
balance
do
the
new
glarus
tickathon
keeps
on
truckin
i
couldnt
remember
the
last
times
i
had
this
beer
3
4
years
either
way
great
sessionable
brew
right
here
notes
tasty
and
pretty
interesting
brown
ale
great
mix
of
flavors
and
a
nice
hoppy
undertone
good
brown
ale
that
while
maybe
not
outstanding
or
something
i
would
crave
it
is
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
the
aroma
is
as
it
should
be
mild
but
pleasant
its
pretty
brown
in
the
glass
i
already
ordered
two
so
i
like
it
more
may
be
coming
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
for
me
light
bodied
with
lower
than
expected
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
starts
to
thicken
up
but
still
not
at
the
right
point
overall
a
decent
brew
but
too
sweet
and
thin
for
me
if
youre
into
malt
bombs
go
for
it
otherwise
theres
better
things
to
pick
up
if
youre
getting
new
glarus
this
beer
pours
a
subtly
hazy
brown
with
a
big
3
inch
cap
that
disappears
into
just
a
thin
cap
massive
amounts
of
lacing
covers
the
inside
of
the
globe
nice
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
fairly
complex
for
most
brown
ales
up
front
notes
of
sweet
caramel
toasted
breads
and
just
a
hint
of
roasted
nuts
underneath
all
that
is
just
a
bit
of
sweet
cherry
as
it
warms
the
cherry
comes
through
a
bit
more
and
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
the
cherry
and
sweet
fruits
is
just
a
bit
more
pronounced
roasted
nuts
and
toasted
bread
this
is
a
tasty
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
about
perfect
for
the
style
there
is
a
nice
creamy
smoothness
at
the
front
part
of
the
mouthfeel
and
it
finishes
fairly
dry
just
about
perfect
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
new
glarus
hits
more
home
runs
then
any
other
brewery
in
my
opinion
just
like
everyone
else
that
doesnt
live
close
to
wisconsin
i
wish
i
could
get
it
here
if
not
for
the
slightly
overdone
bitter
aftertaste
this
would
be
a
standard
for
me
as
it
stands
ill
certainly
have
it
again
just
not
as
often
as
the
less
flavorful
but
also
less
bitter
sprechers
pub
brown
ale
o
quite
flavorful
and
well
constructed
impressive
decent
brown
ale
definitely
on
the
englishsweet
side
wish
more
of
that
hazelnut
thats
so
obvious
in
the
smell
were
present
in
the
flavor
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
o
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
the
sessionability
of
it
is
insane
the
flavours
are
nice
and
bold
yet
not
overwhelming
so
far
this
mixer
pack
is
nailing
it
on
every
level
exceptional
brown
ale
offering
from
new
glarus
the
roasted
malts
in
this
beer
make
for
a
very
pleasant
aroma
and
taste
this
poured
very
nicely
with
a
thick
creamy
head
the
beer
is
very
smooth
as
well
i
was
definitely
able
to
pick
up
the
hazelnut
tones
within
this
beer
that
the
brewery
marks
on
the
bottle
great
variation
of
the
style
i
love
wisconsin
this
brewery
seems
to
be
one
of
its
hidden
gems
looks
good
hefty
brown
with
good
lacing
just
the
right
amount
of
head
shell
do
smells
wonderful
like
toasted
almond
bread
grassy
hops
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
lovely
toasted
but
definately
subtle
enough
to
let
other
flavors
shine
like
mocha
and
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
surprising
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
similar
to
the
belgian
red
but
i
was
wrong
very
smooth
i
really
dont
know
how
a
brown
can
get
much
better
i
could
drink
this
247
better
off
i
stay
south
of
the
boarder
pours
a
light
brown
with
good
layer
of
head
i
did
a
different
pour
with
this
one
so
its
hard
to
comment
toasty
nut
malt
aroma
with
an
herbal
background
english
malts
some
are
saying
yummy
wow
yum
is
right
great
toasty
nut
flavor
with
a
light
bitterness
making
me
want
another
drink
now
carbonation
is
low
body
seems
adequate
reminds
me
of
fat
tire
although
technically
a
different
style
glad
i
got
this
from
my
brew
partner
the
other
day
overall
this
was
an
easy
drinking
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
a
great
anytime
beer
that
goes
well
with
an
american
meal
or
it
can
stand
on
its
own
like
it
is
right
now
its
not
a
crazy
assertive
balaged
bourbon
brandy
apple
tripel
eised
whatever
have
you
but
its
not
a
boring
beer
that
gets
a
meh
from
me
thanks
again
amanda
pours
a
medium
chestnut
some
head
vague
smell
of
almonds
and
a
little
bit
of
coffee
not
real
impressive
or
assertive
to
be
fair
maybe
i
should
have
let
it
warm
does
come
out
of
its
shell
as
i
drink
it
a
more
pronounced
nut
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
pizzaz
tasty
an
easy
drinking
beer
would
love
to
try
it
again
at
a
warmer
temperature
dark
translucent
chestnut
with
a
pretty
nougat
colored
fluffy
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
faint
coffee
sweet
malt
with
a
trace
of
evergreen
toffeelike
malt
with
a
roasty
coffee
kind
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
lean
bodied
with
scrubbing
carbonation
a
well
made
no
frills
kind
of
brown
ale
malty
and
smooth
light
tobacco
and
maple
suggestions
apple
generally
mellow
with
a
light
astringency
a
little
watery
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
reminds
me
of
autumn
nights
in
a
rural
wi
cabin
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
can
remember
tasting
which
is
all
the
more
impressive
as
a
yearround
offering
from
new
glarus
brewing
i
could
get
fat
on
these
o
a
well
crafted
truetoform
english
brown
i
would
definitely
pour
another
one
into
my
glass
do
interesting
beer
for
a
brown
with
a
nut
theme
not
really
my
style
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
an
awesome
brown
great
flavors
great
drinkability
just
a
solid
brew
right
up
there
with
hazelnut
brown
nectar
as
my
favorite
brown
cheers
drinkability
yet
another
awesome
offering
from
new
glarus
it
is
like
the
wonka
factory
for
beer
not
only
is
the
beer
true
to
style
the
aggressive
hazelnut
character
makes
it
distinctive
had
a
fat
squirrel
this
past
weekend
i
poured
the
bottle
into
my
glass
and
it
had
floaters
dmn
it
i
hate
floaters
yje
color
was
definitely
a
redamber
but
had
no
head
the
scent
was
really
nonexisitent
maybe
hints
of
malt
the
taste
was
quite
good
for
an
amber
was
full
bodies
with
nice
malt
charactered
with
a
spruce
of
caramel
this
beer
is
easy
drink
and
could
certainly
be
considered
a
session
beer
enjoy
tastes
of
lightly
toasted
hazelnuts
the
legumey
characteristics
that
unroasted
unsalted
peanuts
have
caramel
malt
hits
mid
sip
and
backs
away
hesitantly
under
cover
of
a
mild
earthen
hop
umbrella
finishes
up
dry
overall
compared
to
some
other
brown
ales
on
the
market
texture
and
body
are
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
liking
on
this
sort
of
flavor
profile
but
thats
about
all
that
is
missing
from
this
brew
o
a
solid
brown
ale
it
might
benefit
with
some
more
body
and
color
but
overall
this
is
easy
drinking
malty
and
unoffensive
o
a
nice
brew
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
this
could
pair
well
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
as
well
o
this
is
a
really
good
brown
ale
filled
with
malty
goodness
very
straight
forward
approach
to
the
style
d
good
beer
another
great
beer
from
ng
i
think
they
do
a
fantastic
job
of
blending
unique
ingredients
into
an
enjoyable
beer
a
good
english
brown
ale
o
this
is
a
lowertier
beer
for
me
of
ngs
regulars
though
still
quite
decent
for
example
i
far
prefer
snowshoe
or
spotted
cow
to
this
o
brown
ales
arent
my
favorite
so
im
slightly
biased
but
this
is
a
solid
above
average
brew
this
pours
a
nice
caramel
brown
and
has
great
foamy
retention
and
layered
lacing
this
beer
is
what
you
would
expect
in
a
brown
ale
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
i
just
dont
love
this
style
of
beer
but
this
beer
does
have
a
nice
crispness
that
takes
away
from
the
syrupiness
this
teeters
on
the
edge
of
burned
malt
red
ale
type
flavors
i
detect
some
booziness
it
has
a
decent
medium
body
and
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
i
just
dont
love
brown
ale
o
im
happy
with
this
beer
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
any
type
of
food
or
drink
on
its
own
as
a
sessionable
beer
very
good
o
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
cost
me
almost
25
bucks
a
six
pack
to
get
it
shipped
to
me
but
it
was
well
worth
it
and
id
do
it
again
clean
and
bright
a
refreshing
brown
o
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
brewery
as
it
is
my
first
from
them
and
it
didnt
disappoint
my
very
open
expectations
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
but
not
seek
out
i
think
the
shock
factor
i
experienced
was
the
sweetness
that
i
was
not
expecting
at
all
with
that
being
said
it
is
not
overly
sweet
just
didnt
expect
it
at
first
good
beer
o
good
nice
brown
malts
good
flavors
not
overboard
on
anything
nice
hop
addition
just
a
little
thin
though
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
fairly
rich
and
really
well
balanced
a
really
amazing
example
of
a
brown
ale
love
the
mix
of
sweetness
and
earthy
flavors
d
good
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
think
it
had
more
of
a
fat
tire
taste
to
it
and
i
would
prefer
one
of
them
not
a
bad
beer
very
mor
brown
very
easy
drinking
no
off
flavors
a
decent
session
brown
o
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
pretty
easy
drinker
id
actually
prefer
this
to
be
a
bit
smoother
but
that
is
only
a
minor
personal
preference
complaint
definitely
well
made
the
hit
of
american
hops
is
an
interesting
and
welcome
addition
a
bit
of
an
irony
maybe
but
it
is
what
it
is
not
an
all
time
favorite
but
i
could
easily
go
back
to
this
one
again
thought
i
didnt
like
the
style
seems
like
i
just
didnt
like
the
beers
in
the
style
that
i
have
tried
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
it
could
be
better
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
my
favorite
parts
of
the
beer
are
the
smell
and
the
packaging
pours
with
a
nice
head
not
thick
but
stays
for
a
long
time
very
nice
lacing
as
well
smells
of
citrus
and
sweetness
but
bitter
hops
are
present
upon
tasting
and
with
the
citrus
make
a
very
pleasant
drinking
experience
the
aftertaste
is
akin
to
light
roasted
coffee
fat
squirrel
ale
is
a
brew
i
definitely
enjoy
drinking
even
in
mass
quantities
this
is
on
the
sweeter
side
for
brown
ales
but
still
boasts
plenty
of
toasty
characters
aftertaste
is
caramel
sweet
very
nicely
done
but
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
new
glarus
this
beer
pours
a
darker
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
beer
there
is
a
strong
nutty
smell
to
it
the
taste
while
smooth
is
strong
and
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
with
nutty
flavors
but
a
strong
malty
bitter
taste
to
finish
full
flavor
with
nice
carbonation
overall
a
really
nice
brown
ale
very
enjoyable
would
deffently
get
another
taste
was
very
roasted
malt
with
a
little
caramel
and
some
hops
the
only
drawbackalthough
this
is
english
style
was
the
slightly
dry
or
metallic
mouth
feel
otherwise
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
slick
feel
somewhat
rather
nice
drinking
poured
into
a
glass
a
little
cloudy
copper
amber
color
not
a
ton
of
head
malty
smell
relatively
strong
sweet
malty
taste
but
of
nut
flavor
fairly
bitter
aftertaste
pretty
smooth
drinking
beer
i
dont
mind
it
although
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
too
many
of
them
in
succession
the
taste
was
great
a
very
good
brown
for
the
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
the
taste
was
the
same
as
smell
the
hop
presence
was
minimal
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
that
is
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
i
would
drink
this
again
blows
away
the
latest
version
of
newcastle
imho
d
this
is
my
third
of
four
main
ng
beers
and
they
are
getting
a
little
better
the
flavors
and
nose
on
this
beer
were
very
nice
a
hoppy
finish
is
always
nice
in
a
brown
ale
but
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
to
the
feel
serving
type
bottle
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
id
buy
6
and
order
another
d
gave
a
fat
squirrel
to
a
friend
that
loves
fat
tire
and
he
immediately
wanted
more
very
drinkable
the
sweet
from
the
finish
lingers
in
a
positive
way
im
a
huge
brown
fan
and
this
would
easily
make
the
rotation
if
i
could
get
it
regularly
overall
impression
easy
to
drink
and
easily
recommended
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
caramelly
in
the
mouth
a
very
nice
beer
all
around
its
moderately
sweet
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
overall
its
a
decent
beer
id
have
it
again
very
light
for
a
nut
brown
ale
its
really
simple
on
the
nutty
profile
with
a
lot
of
hops
compared
to
other
nut
browns
ive
had
the
smell
is
pretty
blah
with
very
little
on
the
nose
its
thin
bodies
and
highly
carbonated
very
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
overall
not
that
great
future
outlook
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
not
a
style
that
usually
demands
my
attention
but
this
one
is
so
well
put
together
that
i
must
say
well
done
nevertheless
an
out
of
state
brew
that
doesnt
come
down
here
so
probably
wont
have
this
again
soon
carbonation
is
normal
definetly
not
a
lot
body
is
lower
medium
and
it
would
make
quite
a
delicious
session
beer
i
just
wish
i
could
get
it
here
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
was
a
very
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
beer
it
had
some
nice
malty
and
nutty
flavors
to
it
and
was
very
smooth
very
nice
beer
for
the
style
and
a
very
nice
beer
overall
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
barely
sticky
i
think
its
a
pretty
solid
beer
overall
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
other
then
it
being
damn
good
a
really
interesting
and
very
very
well
crafted
ale
m
d
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
pretty
good
beer
pours
a
translucent
brownish
amber
with
an
average
foamy
off
white
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
aroma
of
toasted
nuts
some
citrus
and
malty
sweetness
flavor
of
toasted
malts
a
light
hop
bitterness
balanced
by
a
great
nutty
maltiness
decent
brown
ale
i
would
like
to
have
this
regularly
in
my
area
hint
hint
new
glarus
pours
a
light
browndark
copperamber
in
color
the
aroma
is
sparkling
sweet
malt
and
tart
hops
in
a
nice
harmony
the
flavor
is
nice
rich
roasted
malt
much
more
substantial
than
the
aroma
let
on
balanced
with
a
nice
tartness
on
the
finish
i
lived
in
scotland
for
a
year
and
this
reminds
me
of
a
really
nice
scottish
ale
d
an
exceptional
goto
save
for
its
inavailability
outside
wi
i
know
new
glarus
has
a
reason
for
it
but
it
prohibits
me
from
having
this
beer
more
often
thanks
for
bringing
this
one
back
for
me
dan
poured
into
a
shaker
dark
golden
color
almost
amber
with
a
little
tan
head
on
top
aromas
of
toffee
roasted
nuts
and
light
milk
chocolate
on
the
palate
this
one
is
fairly
fullbodied
somewhat
creamy
with
brown
sugar
dark
bread
and
a
light
chocolatecaramel
like
a
rolo
finish
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
but
too
heavy
on
the
palate
to
be
a
good
easy
drinking
session
beer
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
light
off
white
head
the
nose
brings
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
plus
slight
nutty
characteristics
taste
is
doughy
brown
that
is
slightly
nutty
and
some
light
caramel
sweetness
medium
feel
with
good
carbonation
nice
and
simple
and
drinks
well
d
a
very
sessionable
beer
thats
just
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
very
much
in
the
vein
of
new
glarus
beers
though
decent
but
not
outstanding
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
revisit
this
one
though
and
i
could
see
it
being
a
standby
for
some
d
it
is
on
the
high
side
for
a
session
beer
that
has
a
bit
more
robust
roasted
character
thanks
to
florida9
for
this
one
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
light
amber
with
a
2
finger
white
head
no
lacing
lots
of
caramel
sweetness
nuttiness
on
the
nose
taste
like
it
smells
it
finishes
clean
with
just
enough
hops
for
bitterness
well
carbonated
medium
body
easy
drinking
an
all
around
solid
brown
ale
drinkability
seems
to
be
very
drinkable
from
the
great
combination
of
simple
flavors
a
true
brown
ale
should
always
be
pretty
drinkable
and
this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
in
regard
to
drinkability
overall
i
liked
this
a
lot
better
the
first
time
i
had
it
it
actually
prompted
me
to
pick
up
ale
asylums
madtown
nut
brown
ale
which
now
ironically
makes
fat
squirrel
seem
worse
d
one
of
the
best
beers
new
glarus
produces
definitely
a
beer
you
can
throw
back
quite
a
few
and
enjoy
yourself
the
5
8
is
were
the
flavor
is
and
this
goes
great
on
an
crisp
autumn
day
another
great
time
is
early
winter
by
the
fire
worth
giving
a
go
if
you
are
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
an
excellent
brown
ale
lots
of
great
flavors
that
most
american
versions
seem
to
miss
along
with
goose
islands
nut
brown
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
made
versions
highly
recommended
d
one
of
my
favorites
of
new
glarus
regular
offerings
just
enough
flavor
to
back
the
alcohol
and
keep
it
an
easy
drinking
beer
a
beer
well
worth
picking
up
regularly
the
final
brew
taken
down
during
the
mans
weekend
for
me
at
least
it
pours
a
semihazed
ambergarnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
creamy
foam
the
nose
comprises
fish
batter
ljsstyle
seemingly
toffee
buttery
biscuits
and
some
light
orange
zest
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
walnut
light
toffee
light
orange
peel
and
some
blackened
biscuits
the
body
is
a
light
medium
or
heavy
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
grainy
feel
overall
nothing
overtly
special
but
a
decent
enough
nut
brown
a
nice
end
to
one
helluva
weekend
ride
was
able
to
pick
this
up
during
the
weekend
in
the
northwoods
it
pours
a
brownish
orange
with
light
fading
white
foam
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
hazelnuts
along
with
roasted
caramel
and
hints
of
orange
zest
the
taste
isnt
too
far
off
from
the
smell
but
it
is
far
less
complex
the
caramel
malt
is
the
main
flavor
and
the
roasted
malt
gives
it
a
slight
bitterness
the
problem
is
i
wouldnt
go
as
far
to
say
that
it
is
a
nut
brown
as
the
label
claims
i
honestly
dont
taste
the
nuttiness
that
i
was
promised
there
is
also
a
souring
from
what
i
assume
to
be
the
hops
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
weak
to
me
but
its
not
too
bad
if
you
ignore
the
fact
that
its
supposed
to
be
nutty
its
a
nice
solid
brown
ale
revisited
this
brew
after
a
few
years
and
while
id
like
just
a
little
more
malt
flavor
and
body
in
this
its
obviously
a
very
welldone
brown
ale
and
a
very
easy
drinker
no
trouble
at
all
putting
down
quite
a
few
of
these
and
continues
to
be
a
favorite
brown
ale
o
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
get
here
in
cali
or
anywhere
else
that
i
travel
ill
probably
be
trying
to
set
up
a
trade
for
more
of
this
very
soon
smooth
mouthfeel
starts
it
out
but
as
the
finish
kicks
in
a
slight
metallic
pinch
shows
up
its
not
bad
but
it
does
take
away
some
of
the
greatness
to
this
beer
mildly
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
this
is
a
tasty
beverage
well
worth
checking
out
very
drinkable
new
glarus
fat
squirrel
pours
a
redbrown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
lingers
the
aroma
is
sweet
raisiny
malt
with
some
earthy
notes
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
but
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
similar
toffee
and
dark
fruity
notes
upfront
with
some
nice
mild
herbal
and
earthy
hops
not
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
but
enough
to
balance
the
malt
pours
a
majestic
looking
brown
with
a
thin
head
hazelnut
vanilla
some
coffee
dominate
the
nose
similar
flavors
are
at
play
and
to
great
effect
in
my
opinion
malt
dominated
but
not
sweet
no
detectable
hop
bitterness
finishes
rather
dry
solid
beer
for
sure
and
very
sessionable
alewatcher
ill
be
over
soon
with
that
abt
the
mouthfeel
is
as
usual
with
new
glarus
beer
pretty
damn
good
the
body
is
about
medium
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
a
smooth
velvety
feel
almost
slick
on
my
tongue
this
is
yet
another
solid
beer
from
what
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
very
easy
drinking
i
could
gladly
drink
several
of
these
at
a
pub
somewhere
in
the
northwoods
while
nashville
skyline
played
softly
in
the
background
oh
i
actually
have
already
done
that
well
id
do
it
again
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
from
new
glarus
one
id
buy
again
ifwhen
i
return
to
wisconsin
good
beer
fun
label
what
more
could
i
ask
for
while
watching
the
hall
of
fame
game
d
overall
very
nice
very
straightforward
this
seems
like
a
nice
everyday
type
of
beer
solid
enjoyable
and
repeatable
d
a
bit
boring
but
it
is
a
fairly
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
nonetheless
d
i
think
this
to
be
a
great
drinkablity
of
the
style
subtle
flavors
are
nice
on
the
malt
forward
side
and
for
the
color
and
cream
notes
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
dmy
base
assumption
here
is
that
you
could
drink
it
over
and
over
and
you
certainly
wouldnt
end
up
in
a
horrible
shirtsoff
barstoolskootin
street
fight
but
you
might
have
trouble
driving
home
if
you
didnt
pace
yourself
so
um
high
marks
on
drinkability
with
a
slight
caution
i
say
a
decent

with
good
retention

i
also
appreciate
a
dry

aroma
4
50
t
malt
plays
the
primary
role
in
fat

some
coffee
and
nuttiness
are
the
first
flavors
to
step
up
to
the
plate
hop
bite
is
noticeable
though
in
the
background
provides
an
earthy
and
somewhat
grassy
zing

d
all

coffee
flavors
play

role

id

i

drinkable

the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
for
a
brown
ale
maybe
this
helps
to
make
fat
squirrel
plenty
drinkable
just
right
for
when
i
am
in
the
mood
to
drink
a
couple
of
beers
and
call
it
a
night
i
will
seek
this
out
again
the
next
time
i
travel
to
wisconsin
drinkability
highly
sessionable
brown
ale
that
seems
like
it
could
be
in
a
pub
in

the
only
downside
is
that
it
is
a
little
too
light
on
flavor

drinkability
got
to
hand
it
to
new
glarus
they
know
how
to
make
a
refreshing
beer
depth
of
flavor
is
a
bit
lacking
but
thats
not
their
main
focus
mindblowing
not
really
drinkable
yes
drinkability
is
good
although
this
seems
to
be
missing
a
little
something
from
a
complexity
standpoint
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
ovearll
this
is
a
pretty
decent
offering
form
new
glarus
nothing
exceptional
but
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
still
has
some
decent
flavor
id
be
interested
in
trying
this
on
cask
though
not
particularly
bitter
the
malt
dries
nicely
on
the
tongue
and
easily
avoids
being
too
sweet
and
every
bit
of
what
bitterness
it
has
shows
itself
in
the
finish
more
toast
slight
chocolate
light
caramel
carbonation
is
soft
body
perhaps
a
touch
thinner
than
id
prefer
but
not
out
of
style
and
very
very
drinkable
d
pretty
good
really
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
quite
approachable
just
not
very
interesting
flavorful
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
a
good
interpretation
of
the
nut
brownenglish
brown
ale
style
drinkability
is
quite
good
ill
definitely
enjoy
a
few
more
bottles
before
calling
it
a
night
new
glarus
beers
at
a
gas
station
heck
yeah
wisconsin
d
fairly
easy
drinking
brown
ale
d
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
could
drink
it
all
day
this
is
a
nice
craft
offering
that
highlights
the
subtle
malt
yeast
and
hop
flavours
and
balances
them
in
way
that
leaves
the
drinker
underwhelmed
yet
appreciative
of
the
style
and
the
concoction
in
from
of
them
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
going
on
to
keep
me
interested
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
this
is
a
great
spring
beer
when
the
nights
arent
as
warm
as
you
wish
they
were
pours
a
clear
reddish
chestnut
brown
with
a
light
tannish
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
with
minimal
lacing
nose
is
very
toasted
and
nutty
not
overly
complex
or
strong
but
slightly
sweet
and
pleasant
flavor
starts
with
the
nutty
flavor
again
medium
bodied
with
sharp
carbonation
and
mild
bitterness
finish
lingers
with
sweet
nuttiness
a
very
pleasant
drinkable
brown
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
but
is
nothing
remarkably
special
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
pretty
good
beer
nothing
substantial
to
detract
from
the
drinkability
nothing
is
offensive
about
this
ale
pretty
straight
forward
solid
d
this
beer
is
actually
quite
drinkable
due
to
the
light
body
and
subtle
flavors
not
overly
complex
and
pretty
enjoyable
a
nut
brown
they
say
an
amber
i
see
i
have
problems
with
this
beer
because
its
nice
and
tasty
clean
and
all
around
unoffensive
but
this
is
not
a
brown
ale
its
transparent
lightly
ambered
in
color
and
has
a
reasonable
amount
of
fizz
where
are
the
earthy
notes
and
heady
brashness
of
a
true
brown
maybe
i
am
being
overly
harsh
but
give
me
some
chutzpa
with
my
browns
this
brew
is
much
better
than
i
had
remembered
it
has
a
sweeteness
and
smooth
texture
that
make
it
worth
trying
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
before
and
practically
lived
on
it
in
college
1
mugs
of
this
all
day
every
day
at
my
favorite
bar
and
this
bottle
just
wasnt
exactly
what
i
remembered
the
date
code
only
says
it
is
about
4
months
which
isnt
terrible
but
maybe
not
ideal
this
was
my
first
craft
beer
i
ever
tasted
and
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
i
still
remember
on
the
morning
of
my
21st
birthday
going
out
with
my
friends
and
buying
a
12
pack
of
high
life
and
a
6
pack
of
fat
squirrel
i
really
hope
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
and
it
just
isnt
my
fond
memories
overlooking
the
just
above
average
beer
i
will
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
and
do
a
rerate
fat
squirrel
ale
is
probably
my
favorite
new
glarus
beer
so
far
it
was
actually
a
little
sweet
i
could
definitely
taste
the
nut
flavor
at
the
same
time
it
was
almost
like
roasted
nut
though
it
was
something
a
little
different
any
new
glarus
fan
or
english
brown
ale
fan
should
give
this
beer
a
try
the
palate
opens
quite
rich
and
nutty
again
with
a
nutty
bitterness
a
burnt
sugar
character
and
some
toffee
definitely
nutty
with
almost
a
little
astringency
this
is
solid
stuff
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
thats
earthy
and
a
little
spicy
this
mediumlight
bodied
beer
has
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
drinkable
stuff
id
like
to
try
this
on
cask
solid
english
brown
ale
not
flashy
but
no
complaints
here
the
taste
is
a
brown
ale
mixed
with
skunk
and
at
the
end
a
little
malt
this
is
not
good
by
any
means
the
feel
is
very
light
not
drinkable
di
believe
this
can
be
a
good
beer
dont
drink
too
warm
otherwise
it
can
taste
very
run
of
the
mill
okay
but
i
think
there
are
others
i
would
try
in
this
category
d
very
good
with
that
great
brown
ale
taste
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
4
5
pours
orangishbrown
with
a
white
head
not
the
color
i
was
expecting
from
a
brown
ale
the
aroma
is
very
nutty
with
some
malty
sweetness
as
well
the
flavor
is
nutty
with
some
sweetness
about
like
the
aroma
lighter
mouthfeel
and
lower
carbonation
the
taste
is
clean
and
restrained
if
this
isnt
your
style
fat
squirrel
isnt
going
to
change
your
mind
with
a
mindblowing
outofthebox
interpretation
however
if
you
like
a
nice
sessionable
english
brown
its
going
to
be
hard
for
you
to
get
much
better
although
subtle
the
flavors
are
actually
quite
complex
it
starts
with
a
walnuthazelnut
flavor
thats
gradually
supplemented
with
a
sweet
caramel
note
that
fades
into
a
bready
finish
with
some
light
hop
bitterness
underneath
in
keeping
with
the
style
none
of
the
flavors
is
particularly
strong
but
the
balance
is
impressive
making
this
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
taste
has
a
moderate
malt
sweetness
with
a
nutty
caramel
character
malts
have
a
toffeelike
character
mediumbodied
with
a
dry
finish
and
lots
of
carbonation
im
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
and
this
offering
from
new
glarus
is
quite
nice
pale
brown
and
cloudy
it
has
a
clean
malty
aroma
the
two
flavors
are
a
roasted
malt
and
a
hop
bite
both
tastes
are
very
subtle
and
seem
to
flip
flop
fat
squirrel
is
creamy
and
very
easy
drinking
this
was
my
first
new
glarus
after
reading
about
them
and
wondering
how
i
could
get
a
few
for
quite
a
while
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
thanks
to
nick
and
his
fatherinlaw
for
bringing
these
back
from
wisconsin
and
sharing
them
t
the
appearance
i
was
expecting
for
a
brown
ale
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
small
head
i
was
impressed
with
the
first
sip
has
a
creamy
easy
drink
ability
to
it
not
picking
up
too
much
nut
flavor
here
but
this
is
a
really
good
beer
alc
content
is
virtually
non
present
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
more
of
these
if
i
had
more
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
medium
pour
yielded
a
small
head
that
disappeared
but
there
was
some
really
nice
lacing
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
as
i
drank
great
brown
coloring
im
not
sure
if
it
was
the
way
i
held
it
or
what
but
it
appeared
to
be
a
bit
darker
at
the
top
then
it
was
at
the
bottom
this
had
a
strong
cider
smell
to
it
with
just
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
very
good
appearance
and
smell
overall
the
flavor
unfortunately
was
just
soso
it
had
a
nutty
earthy
flavor
to
it
that
was
just
a
little
heavy
in
the
mouth
there
was
just
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
to
it
that
seemed
to
grow
the
more
i
drank
at
first
i
thought
that
the
alcohol
flavor
may
have
been
a
bit
too
much
to
have
more
than
just
one
or
two
at
dinner
but
by
the
time
i
was
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
was
ready
for
more
so
the
drinkability
was
higher
then
my
initial
thought
so
easy
to
drink
very
delicious
beer
that
would
be
a
nice
session
brew
d
im
a
big
fan
of
anything
new
glarus
has
brewed
and
this
one
is
no
exception
an
excellent
interpretation
of
this
brew
style
and
one
i
would
recommend
to
anybody
that
enjoys
a
good
english
brown
d
light
and
easy
to
drink
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
different
types
of
cuisine
taste
very
flavorful
for
a
nut
brown
again
taste
wise
not
nut
browns
typical
blandness
seriously
one
of
the
best
tastes
ive
experienced
in
a
nut
brown
ale
a
degree
of
hop
not
the
low
ibu
or
lacking
bitterness
youll
see
new
glarus
as
usual
very
innovative
and
not
for
the
sake
of
being
weird
grows
on
ya
drinkable
indeed
drinkability
certainly
flavorful
and
interesting
enough
to
keep
one
coming
back
for
more
d
i
expect
more
from
nonsession
beers
and
this
one
delivers
quite
handily
its
incredibly
tasty
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
my
gold
standards
for
the
style
d
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
i
really
dont
love
the
style
but
occasionally
i
get
a
craving
for
one
this
satisfied
my
craving
if
im
in
the
mood
again
id
pick
it
up
if
no
dfh
indian
brown
was
readily
available
md
medium
bodied
brew
smooth
sitting
on
the
tongue
and
going
down
a
very
drinkable
english
brown
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
really
good
brew
to
share
and
introduce
to
others
not
familiar
with
the
style
overall
a
super
easy
drinker
ive
always
had
a
fondness
for
this
beer
its
served
at
many
places
around
town
so
its
a
good
go
to
when
i
cant
find
anything
i
like
served
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
significant
head
that
quickly
subsides
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
foam
and
a
very
large
amount
of
lacing
very
pleasant
aroma
featuring
maltypeaty
notes
really
nice
malty
flavor
showing
notes
of
smoke
nuts
and
rye
bread
thatbreadiness
really
comes
through
on
the
aftertaste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
full
round
and
smooth
as
is
typical
of
new
glarus
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
a
crisp
autumn
or
early
winter
evening
drinkability
very
easy
beer
to
drink
the
nuttiness
provides
enough
enjoyment
in
this
brown
ale
not
bad
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
the
carbonation
kind
of
bites
too
much
pretty
light
overall
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beers
body
is
light
the
light
carbonation
levels
work
well
with
the
beer
in
all
honesty
this
is
a
very
good
throw
back
beer
drinkabilityvery
drinkable
brew
could
throw
back
many
of
these
without
feeling
the
least
bit
guilty
due
to
the
very
low
price
and
abv
presence
typical
sessionable
brown
ale
drinkability
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
very
easy
drinking
i
enjoyed
it
d
i
drank
one
because
that
was
all
i
had
id
drink
more
but
probalby
would
go
for
something
else
decent
body
on
this
carbonation
level
is
moderate
to
low
this
is
much
more
creamy
than
i
expected
but
i
like
it
an
easy
sipper
for
sure
nice
roasted
flavors
abound
slight
nuttiness
mixed
with
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
that
is
very
pleasant
this
is
really
good
thanks
again
andy
for
the
trade
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
pale
amberbrown
color
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
with
lightly
toasted
notes
breadiness
nuttiness
and
caramel
maybe
some
toffee
the
taste
reflects
a
similar
malt
forward
profile
with
the
light
toastiness
and
caramel
showing
through
predominately
hopped
only
to
balance
no
real
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
on
the
watery
side
but
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
creamy
feel
and
it
has
a
semidry
finish
overall
a
very
sessionable
beer
not
new
glaruss
most
impressive
brew
but
a
good
drinking
ale
mouthfeel
is
creamy
a
bit
light
and
fluffy
nicely
done
d
averageplus
this
beer
is
decent
overall
but
nothing
really
stands
out
d
the
hops
help
keep
an
otherwise
malty
beer
balanced
and
drinkable
but
the
grassyness
doesnt
mesh
that
well
in
my
opinion
and
leaves
me
wanting
a
fuller
maltier
nut
brown
ale
good
beginningoffall
beer
for
the
brisk
lawn
mowing
though
12oz
poured

teaish
brown
color
with
a
nice
pillowy
offwhite
head
that
left
some
sticky
spotty
lacing
on
the

aroma
and
tastes
were
similar
sweet
toffee
toasted
grains
quite
nutty
somewhat
bready
with
some
caramel
notes
finishes
sweet
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
but
ideal
for
the
style
very
good
representation
of
the
style
with
great
drinkability
overall
for
a
brown
this
is
nothing
impressive
very
boring
but
has
the
typical
flavors
to
it
not
something
id
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
is
drinkable
d
i
would
drink
this
one
everyday
for
a
while
and
then
take
some
time
off
week
or
two
then
dive
right
back
into
it
damn
good
beer
very
drinkable
tasty
but
not
overly
sweet
goes
down
smooth
and
enjoyable
solid
brown
ale
with
a
nice
roasty
tang
to
it
and
the
spiciness
of
the
english
hops
added
some
decent
zip
i
could
definitely
see
this
being
a
quality
brown
to
enjoy
in
the
cooler
months
drinkability
pretty
sweet
tasting
brown
ale
that
goes
down
easy
i
enjoyed
one
with
some
burgers
i
grilled
up
and
the
other
while
relaxing
after
dinner
this
is
a
nice
standby
to
have
on
hand
for
all
kinds
of
beer
drinkers
a
decent
brown
ale
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
liking
d
the
perfect
brew
to
enjoy
while
relaxing
by
a
campfire
out
in
nature
the
nuttiness
combined
with
the
mapleish
malts
gives
it
a
really
nice
complexity
and
creaminess
that
i
enjoyed
alot
an
excellent
beer
for
fall
as
well
if
you
arent
in
the
mood
for
a
marzen
style
a
6
pack
of
this
would
not
last
long
at
all
drinkablity
quaffable

a

a
medium
sized
ring
around
the

a

lightly

malty

simple

good

with

nothing
special

a
solid
brown
ale
a
very
enjoyable
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
i
always
have
some
of
these
in
my
refrigerator
had
this
beer
while
in
duluth
at
a
tiki
party
for
the
first
time
not

bad

is
fine

coffee
notes
come
with
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
good
light

medium
consistency
i
would
say
just
heavier
than
new
castle
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
always
the
company
is
was
with
definitely
made
for
a
pleasurable
drinking
experience

good
sessionable

my
second
beer
from
new
glarus
brewing
not
bad
but
not
exactly
my
thing
wow
the
taste
is
pretty
darn
good
there
is
some
chocolate
in
there
with
the
brown
ale
nice
malt
and
and
finish
the
flavors
change
really
fast
in
your
mouth
from
many
different
tastes
the
finish
starts
to
give
you
a
chalky
dry
aftertaste
but
then
right
after
that
it
smooths
out
to
a
calming
slide
down
your
throat
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
nut
brown
ale
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
session
brew
as
many
other
reviews
have
already
pointed
out
another
solid
offering
from
new
glarus
great
sweet
nuttycaramel
hint
of
toffee
flavor
super
smooth
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
creamy
feel
going
down
this
is
a
very
drinkible
brew
i
wish
these
were
available
here
in
mass
a
solid
brew
would
taste
great
with
a
pork
chop
dinner
a
good
brew
to
enjoy
on
an
crisp
autumn
night
solid
every
day
offering
to
keep
on

nothing
fantastic
but
a
good
solid
brew
would
make
a
good
session
beer
d
easy
to
finish
one
of
if
not
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
bring
some
of
this
back
every
time
im
in
wi
nice
brown
color
i
bit
of
nutty
yet
bread
like
smell
this
had
a
bit
of
a
sweetness
to
it
but
it
was
balanced
out
by
the
hops
very
carbonated
a
lot
more
than
expected
and
while
i
normally
like
a
nicely
carbonated
beer
i
felt
it
was
too
much
for
the
taste
it
sort
of
distracts
from
the
flavor
wonderfully
drinkable
i
wish
these
guys
would
distribute
down
here
this
is
a
nice
little
session
beer
i
could
put
back
a
few
these
to
bad
i
only
had
one
overall
pretty
good
drinkability
the
yeasty
flavor
up
front
is
a
little
too
much
but
when
it
fades
the
remaining
flavors
are
pleasing
good
session
beer
and
good
to
have
in
the
fridge
for
those
times
you
just
want
a
basic
beer
d
refreshing
and
certainly
tasty
new
glarus
has
such
a
wide
variety
of
beers
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
what
they
have
to
offer
d
this
is
definitely
a
sessionable
everyday
kind
of
beer
this
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
d
this
is
a
very
pleasant
english
brown
while
the
flavors
dont
really
jump
out
too
much
it
lives
up
to
the
expectations
of
the
style
comment
i
really
like
this
beer
a
great
edc
beer
ive
had
it
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
and
both
are
great
its
not
a
smack
you
in
the
face
with
bold
flavors
beer
it
is
a
very
richly
mild
tasty
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
quick
dissipating
head
that
leaves
a
18
inch
copper
ring
its
just
ok
smell
it
nutty
hoppy
and
malt
i
detect
some
sour
yeast
the
taste
is
good
its
drinkable
its
a
sweet
nutty
hop
and
malt
taste
up
front
with
a
nice
balance
of
both
it
finishes
with
a
little
sour
yeast
taste
that
i
like
and
do
not
find
in
most
browns
this
brown
is
good
and
i
recommend
trying
it
i
buy
singles
frequently
of
this
one
and
will
continue
to
do
so
try
this
one
d
very
high
awesome
brown
ale
actually
i
was
about
to
give
up
on
the
regular
offerings
from
new
glarus
after
the
last
couple
ive
had
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
very
nice
beer
overall
an
excellent
example
of
style
but
nothing
particularly
special
d
not
too
bad
decent
daily
drinker
will
drink
again
pours
deep
amber
colour
with
one
finger
head
which
dissapeared
quickly
smell
roasty
malts
some
honey
raisins
perhaps
some
nutty
flavour
taste
nice
bready
flavour
upfront
slightly
yeasty
and
malty
flavours
to
follow
a
bit
spicy
finishes
fruity
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
pretty
complex
and
pleasant
flavour
creamy
and
smooth
it
has
some
spicy
kick
wich
gives
it
an
additional
character
it
would
make
a
decent
sessional
beer
i
like
it
its
good
this
is
a
drinkable
brown
but
watch
out
for
the
acidic
carbonation
that
will
stick
with
you
afterwards
overall
a
very
good
brown
if
you
love
browns
trade
for
it
or
if
you
have
easy
access
i
would
buy
this
for
sure
but
i
dont
think
i
will
waste
a
trade
on
this
one
since
i
am
not
a
huge
brown
fan
d
i
found
this
beer
a
bit
disappointing
but
far
from
bad
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
character
for
me
it
could
qualify
as
an
amber
ale
but
no
matter
the
style
its
not
a
terribly
interesting
beer
d
an
easy
drink
to
throw
back
shame
they
dont
have
this
is
chicago
bars
new
glarus
makes
some
good
beer
this
went
very
well
with
my
grilled
steak
and
potato
d
this
one
wont
burn
out
your
tastebuds
or
liver
but
my
interest
in
it
is
slightly
burnt
out
drinkability
is
great
maybe
a
little
sweet
for
too
many
in
a
row
but
overalla
great
beer
big
ups
to
ba
kplynch
for
a
quality
bonus
brew
all
in
all
a
nice
clean
english
brown
ale
easy
drinking
goes
down
fairly
smooth
and
has
just
enough
complexity
in
the
flavor
profile
to
keep
it
from
being
boring
not
outstanding
or
unbelievably
memorable
but
definitely
a
solid
drink
and
definitely
glad
i
got
to
sample
it
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
a
dark
amber
light
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
some
biscuity
malt
sugars
and
toffee
in
the
aroma
tastes
like
a
thin
version
of
a
brown
ale
a
bit
more
pleasing
to
me
some
bitterness
after
a
strong
dose
of
caramel
like
malts
in
the
flavor
thin
light
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
at
the
end
good
session
beer
thanks
to
taturbo
for
the
ng
shipment
mouthfeel
is
nice
carbonation
is
good
very
drinkable
i
have
to
say
putting
a
nice
distinct
nutty
taste
in
a
brown
ale
tastes
so
natural
very
good
beer
thanks
natasharai
in
the
end
drinkable
especially
with
fish
and
chips
with
nice
malt
vinegar

beer
is
just
sweet
enough
and
all
the
other
great
fried
foods
found
in
bars
onion
rings
shrimp
cauliflower
etc
this
also
makes
a
great
companion
for
blue
cheeses
nuts
a
more
sophisticated
pairing
dark

to
light
orange
appearance

a
one
finger

good
retention
settles
to
about
18
in
thickness
and
stays
put
smells
of
malts
slight
caramel
and
some
nutty
fruitiness
i
dont
detect
any
hop
aromas
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
clean
tastes
as
it
smells
quite
malty
with
just
a
minor
hint
of
hops
for
balance
low
carbonation
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
make
for
a
easy
to
drink
brew
this
stuff
just
glides
down
the
throat
very
sessionable
if
given
the
choice
between
this
and
spotted
cow
at
a
bar
or
restaurant
i
would
choose
this
any
day
drinkability
new
glarus
makes
some
very
good
beers
unfortunately
their
flagship
spotted
cow
is
only
middling
this
beer
is
probably
the
second
most
widespread
of
the
new
glarus
line
and
is
much
more
deserving
of
notice
a
great
beer
from
a
great
beer
crafter
deep
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
beige
head
good
lacing
and
retention
but
this
beer
is
a
little
light
in
color
aroma
is
toasted
grains
and
hazelnuts
with
some
darker
bready
notes
flavor
is
basically
identical
sweet
but
not
too
rich
light
airy
mouthfeel
and
a
lot
of
flavor
make
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
d
pretty
drinkable
i
must
say
would
probably
be
even
better
on
a
hot
summer
evening
than
a
cold
february
night

slightly
poppycockish
in
a
way
on

the

and
a

the
flavor
reveals
more
hops
than
i
picked
up
on
the
nose
which
are
herbaecious
and
the
malt
is
mild
with
the
chocolate
translating
well
overall
pretty
smooth
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
though
pretty
drinkable
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
a
very
good
brown
ale
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
i
like
the
berry
like
fruitiness
and
i
like
that
it
is
well
balanced
by
the
toasty
malt
character
this
drinks
quite
easily
and
i
could
easily
spend
an
afternoon
with
a
couple
of
these
beers
this
was
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
right
now
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
but
what
a
pleasant
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
browns
ive
ever
had
this
one
has
it
all
balance
flavor
great
lacing
soft
pillowy
feel
low
and
wellhidden
alcohol
recommended
drinkability
is
super
high
for
this
one
i
have
not
liked
brown
ales
in
the
past
at
all
including
this
one
but
my
tastes
have
grown
as
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
balanced
and
full
of
rich
flavor
this
is
as
good
as
anything
new
glarus
brews
one
of
my
new
favorites
and
a
nice
surprise
to
find
out
i
love
it
cheers
not
bad
not
sensational
but
not
bad
overall
impression
overall
i
would
seek
out
this
beer
again
although
the
flavors
are
not
overpowering
they
are
enough
to
keep
the
beer
from
being
boring
i
like
how
it
balances
a
nice
level
of
flavor
and
complexity
with
a
light
body
i
could
see
myself
sitting
back
in
the
fall
with
a
this
beer
grilling
up
some
burgers
and
enjoying
the
slight
chill
in
the
air
d
this
was
a
very
nice
nut
brown
and
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
would
love
to
try
this
again
flavor
has
great
strength
and
i
find
this
very
drinkable
looking
forward
to
trying
other
ng
beers
in
the
future
d
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
the
nuttiness
in
the
beer
is
not
overwhelming
and
the
malts
are
a
good
compliment
to
the
beer
drinkability
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
find
myself
taking
sips
far
too
often
oh
and
the
head
retention
is
excellent
and
theres
quite
a
bit
of
sticky
lacing
all
around
a
very
nice
brew
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
really
dig
this
one
it
is
cold
as
hell
here
during
my
visit
to
wisconsin
and
this
one
really
warmed
me
up
and
brought
a
smile
to
my
face
md
very
mild
easily
drinkable
beer
nothing
is
too
overpowering
and
it
is
balanced
well
i
could
take
a
case
of
this
and
be
very
happy
exceptionally
drinkable
good
for
sessioning
perfect
for
an
english
brown
this
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
has
very
smooth
finish
with
moderate
carbonation
it
feels
nice
and
smooth
going
down
and
quite
drinkable
definitely
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
albeit
probably
thinner
than
many
other
brown
ales
ive
had
but
certainly
not
lacking
in
flavor
i
pick
these
up
a
lot
especially
since
i
can
find
it
in
most
of
the
bars
around
here
one
of
my
go
to
new
glarus
beers
ill
slam
a
fat
squirrel
any
day
i
recommend
this
brown
ale
because
of
its
borwnaleiness
it
is
a
simple
and
relaxed
brown
ale
that
has
subtle
sweetness
nuttiness
hoppiness
and
a
unique
earthiness
pours
deep
copper
with
an
inch
high
head
that
stays
for
days
when
customers
ask
about
this
beer
i
tell
them
that
it
is
an
american
version
of
the
newcastle
but
earthier
try
one
youll
see
drinkability
is
good
definitely
a
tasty
brown
ale
recommended
again
everything
i
have
from
ng
is
just
great
drinks
easy
not
a
bad
brown
could
session
on
this
easily
d
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
representative
of
style
many
english
browns
have
bitter
notes
and
this
onewhich
sets
it
apartdefinitely
does
not
also
more
complex
than
the
typical
english
brown
honestly
even
though
new
glarus
is
a
quality
brewery
i
was
still
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
thanks
to
my
wife
for
bringing
this
one
back
from
madison
for
me
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
enough
to
encourage
good
drinkability
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
beer
smells
nutty
and
malty
carameltoffee
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
herevery
creamy
and
soft
in
keeping
with
the
style
which
is
achieved
very
well
here
very
little
bitterness
just
nutty
creamy
caramelized
malt
not
sweet
though
a
bit
boring
but
a
good
session
beer
well
made
like
everything
else
from
these
guys
m
d
medium
body
a
little
bit
of
weightiness
decent
brew
all
around
and
a
nice
brown
even
if
it
is
a
little
pale
not
the
best
english
brown
ale
ive
had
but
its
fairly
solid
love
the
label
as
well
plenty
of
fat
squirrels
in
maine
i
guess
the
same
is
in
wisconsin
conclusion
a
good
englishstyle
brown
ale
no
doubt
about
it
while
theres
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
the
hazelnut
and
chocolate
aromas
and
nutty
flavors
are
nice
while
the
malthop
balance
is
near
perfect
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
light
brown
color
with

that
dissipates

with

strong

dont

how
to
add

the

page
itself
taste
is
a
bit
boring
too
caramel
flavors
not
crazy
sweet
but
an
astringent
sweetness
builds
up
on
the
sides
as
you
try
to
finish
off
the
bottle
something
a
little
annoying
about
this
beer
it
cant
be
that
every
time
i
had
one
of
the
five
that
i
was
simply
just
not
in
the
mood
the
body
is
medium
but
theres
something
a
bit
syrupy
just
isnt
refreshing
and
not
interesting
enough
to
be
satisfying
d
nice
quaffable
nut
brown
from
new
glarus
i
love
the
name
of
this
brew
perfect
for
a
nut
brown
ale
d
the
beer
does
have
a
good
taste
but
wasnt
really
happy
with
it
by
the
end
of
the
glass
probably
dont
envision
having
more
then
2
at
a
time
this
is
a
very
good
english
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
good
full
flavors
but
not
too
overpowering
for
the
average
beer
drinker
one
of
the
most
impressive
likable
brown
ales
ive
had
as
with
new
glarus
many
other
aboveaverage
offerings
its
all
about
attention
to
detail
use
of
quality
ingredients
and
loyalty
to
style
while
also
putting
the
brewers
unique
stamp
on
the
final
product
per
style
ng
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
peppery
earthen
hops
immediately
envigorate
the
palate
while
english
toffee
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
buttery
alcohol
provides
an
excellent
balance
the
medium
body
provides
a
nearperfect
carbonation
level
and
a
beautiful
spicy
hop
finish
cant
wait
to
try
this
beer
again
d
very
drinkable
session
beer
this
is
beer
is
one
of
my
wifes
favorite
beers
the
nice
hop
aroma
is
appealing
the
color
is
a
nice
caramel
brown
the
taste
has
a
oat
flavor
with
a
nice
hop
finish
i
request
this
beer
anyone
who
wants
a
change
from
the
same
old
brown
ales
that
still
has
a
bite
to
it
overall
smooth
mild
and
flavorful
a
good
session
beer
thanks
mike
with
such
a
weak
aroma
i
thought
this
was
gonna
be
weak
but
that
quickly
changed
after
i
took
a
sip
very
drinkable
would
make
a
good
session
beer
if
only
i
could
get
new
glarus
stuff
around
here
not
much
carbonation
and
a
medium
bodied
beer
very
drinkable
which
is
evident
as
i
enjoyed
a
2nd
fat
squirrel
despite
the
variety
that
was
available
to
me
my
friend
mara
went
to
madison
to
visit
a
friend
and
fulfilled
my
one
request
bring
me
back
something
from
new
glarus
furthermore
she
knows
i
go
in
for
the
dark
malty
beers
and
knew
this
nutty
brown
would
be
right
up
my
alley
i
dont
think
they
actually
used
hazelnuts
but
they
sure
nailed
what
they
were
going
for
this
rich
velvety
ale
goes
down
like
carbonated
nutella
pairing
recommendation
just
that
nutella
on
toast
to
match
the
toasty
malts
if
youre
looking
for
a
breakfast
pairing
maybe
a
bowl
of
peanut
butter
capn
crunch
all
i
know
is
i
want
to
spend
some
time
in
wisc
so
i
can
try
more
of
their
beers
in
addition
to
the
bock
and
spotted
cow
mara
snuck
past
tsa
d
easy
drinking
a
good
mix
of
body
and
flavor
it
doesnt
sit
too
heavily
on
my
profile
d
very
drinkable
although
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
more
than
maybe
2
at
a
sitting

quickly

pretty
good

with
a
slight

aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
a
much
sweeter

complex
version
of
the
nose
there
is
a
huge
sweet

slug
up
front
that
flows
right
into
a
roasted

flavor
with
some
maple
syrup
sweetness
in
there
as
well
i
also
got
a
hint
of
fruits
maybe
raisins
right
before
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
extremely
crisp
despite
the
sweetness
this
is
a
very
good
nut
brown
and
the
taste
is
extremely
well
balanced
yet
unique
i
really
like
this
one
and
could
drink
it
all
night
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
this
bier
good
stuff
bitterness
is
apparent
but
hop
flavor
aroma
is
limited
or
masked
by
the
heavy
roasted
malt
flavors
which
is
pretty
true
to
style
it
has
a
dry
finish
which
helps
driknability
but
kind
leaves
me
unsatisfied
overall
a
good
interpretation
of
an
english
brown
d
nice
smooth
brown
ale
a
little
roasty
for
my
taste
but
still
quite
drinkable
the
taste
is
interesting
it
has
all
of
those
elements
from
the
nose
and
all
those
youd
expect
in
a
brown
ale
but
its
offset
by
a
surprisingly
creamy
mouthfeel
i
usually
dont
expect
a
ton
out
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
offers
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
nicely
done
d
nice
brown
but
not
the
best
out
there
worth
a
shot
if
you
havent
had
it
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
short
lived
beige
head
smell
is
nutty
and
lightly
coffee
like
along
with
a
touch
of
cream
really
nice
and
smooth
and
inviting
taste
is
very
smooth
as
well
with
a
balanced
nuttiness
as
the
nose
indicates
light
carbonation
and
a
full
mouthfeel
very
clean
nutty
flavor
that
is
superbly
balanced
and
lightly
bittered
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
without
being
overly
so
fantastic
brown
ale
this
is
a
great
standby
beer
as
its
available
nearly
everywhere
in
wisconsin
it
seems
to
hold
up
well
with
even
non
beer
drinkers
thanks

mmmm
snickers
there
was
also
a
bit
of
beef
like
meatiness
from
the
malt
that
reminded
me
of
beef
with
barley
soup
that
may
sound
weird
but
it
works
for
this
beer
the
beef
flavor
was
also
prominent
in
a
wee
heavy
called
orkney
skullsplitter
which
i
loved
not
unpleasant
at
all
light
mouthfeel
with
big
carbonation
finishes
sweet
and
lingers
for
a
bit
dquite
drinkable
although
it
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
drinkability
easy
and
light
drinking
a
good
crowd
pleaser
nothing
spectacular
but
certainly
worth
a
try
note
i
need
to
trade
with
someone
in
wisconsin
mellow
mellow
mellow
flavors
are
there
but
just
under
what
youd
want
out
of
an
english
brown
if
you
want
an
easy
drinker
this
is
a
decent
pick
if
youre
looking
for
something
thats
worthy
of
appreciative
drinking
session
id
look
for
something
with
a
bit
more
character
this
is
a
very
nicely
done
beer
well
balanced
and
interesting

up

and
dry
on
the
finish
very
slick

very

another

this

favorite

ales
as
a
good
session
beer
its
an
interesting
take
on
brown
ale
some
interesting
flavors
going
on
but
the
finish
is
a
little
off
overall
not
too
shabby
ill
have
another
sorry
i
forgot
who
you
are
so
thanks
to
the
unknown
ba
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
is
not
rich
or
heavy

does
showcase
a
solid

of
flavors
that
work
well
together

this

and
be

happy
might
have
to
put
this

back

my
wants

seems
to
be
more
of
a
traditional
brown
ale
which
unfortunately
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
the
nut
flavors
that
this
brings
to
the
table
saves
it

unmemorable

five
for
the
style
very
creamy
medium
body
nicely
carbonated
and
silky
smooth
nut
browns
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
is
nothing
special
but
its
definitely
a
very
solid
example
good
session
beer
and
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
more
of
these
body
is
medium
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
if
brown
ales
are
your
thing
this
screams
session
ale
i
got
this
as
an
extra
from
grizzlyadams
thanks
man
for
a
nutbrown
ale
this
sure
looks
a
heck
of
a
lot
like
an
amber
ale
the
head
is
like
white
cream
though
smell
is
sorta
nutty
and
then
the
taste
really
backs
that
up
with
some
serious
nutty
hazelnut
flavors
which
almost
overwhelm
the
palate
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
just
because
it
is
so
different
than
any
other
nutbrown
ale
i
have
ever
had
this
was
a
clear
deep
amber
with
chestnut
hues
and
a
creamy
tan
headlacing
quite
nice
to
look
at
nose
was
of
cola
really
quite
nutty
and
caramelly
nice
complex
malt
backbone
with
a
semidrying
finish
hops
are
in
the
background
here
spritzy
and
light
to
medium
in
body
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
body
was
fairly
thin
and
the
finish
a
bit
on
the
stale
side
or
i
would
have
rated
higher
pours
a
copper
yellowish
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
nuttiness
and
a
dry
end
in
the
taste
just
like
aroma
a
sweet
nuttiness
to
a
nice
dry
end
a
nice
smoooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
nutty
aftertaste
nice
brown
ale
sweet
and
dry
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
makes
a
solid
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
chewy
but
a
little
short
for
what
i
like
in
a
brown
not
too
creamy
and
a
little
thin
but
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
good
i
could
sit
and
enjoy
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
d
maybe
im
being
generous
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
hoppy
take
on
a
brown
ale
but
it
is
still
balanced
enough
in
the
malt
department
to
distinguish
itself
as
such
not
too
bad
it
was
quite
robust
for
an
english
brown
ale
but
delicious
anyway
dunno
what
that
alcohol
quality
was
to
it
whatever
its
still
tasty
despite
not
falling
in
line
with
its
english
counterparts
d
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
overall
a
nice
little
brown
ale
quality
ingredients
and
well
brewed
pretty
much
to
style
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
i
really
liked
how
it
made
me
think
of
caramel
apples
white
drinking
it
quite
sessionable
definitely
one
of
the
more
potent
new
glarus
brews
and
certainly
one
of
my
favorites
cheers
to
anyone
in
the
wisconsin
area
because
i
cant
even
order
their
beer
back
home
in
ohio
md
thinner
than
expected
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
is
an
easy
drinker
and
a
fully
enjoyable
beer
as
to
be
expected
with
a
beer
from
new
glarus
well
done
thanks
to
thefatkid13
for
delivering
the
goods
sampled
this
a
few
months
ago
and
just
found
the
notes
scribbled
out
on
an
old
postit
behind
the
computer
monitor
i
remember
enjoying
this
one
a
lot
though
pours
a
light
brown
with
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
smells
of
nuts
and
toasty
malt
aroma
of
hops
is
barely
discernible
through
the
malt
tasted
nutty
then
sweet
malt
then
a
crispdry
finish
malt
is
complex
must
be
several
in
there
contributing
to
the
flavor
slightly
sweet
that
fades
into
toasty
and
even
smoky
finish
nicely
carbonated
and
light
enough
to
enjoy
several
in
one
evening
great
example
of
a
nut
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
and
great
flavors
i
would
keep
this
one
on
hand
if
it
were
more
widely
available
thanks
to
bill
for
bringing
me
a
bottle
thanks
to
wasatch
for
including
this
in
our
trade
served
in
a
frosted
pint
glass
sigh
let
it
warm
up
for
a
while
translucent
brown
with
slight
orange
tint
and
a
thin
bright
white
head
that
quickly
fled
nose
was
malty
slight
hops
and
slightly
sweet
malts
nose
was
weak
some
malts
but
not
much
else
maybe
i
needed
to
let
it
warm
up
even
more
mouthfeel
was
pretty
decent
and
drinkability
was
good
a
sessionable
beer
this
beer
had
a
small
frothy
head
and
light
lacing
the
color
was
a
opaque
orange
with
grey
overtones
the
nose
had
a
yummy
hazelnut
and
bannana
aroma
sweet
caramel
mixed
with
with
a
dusty
walnuts
that
fade
into
a
spicy
clove
smoky
sweet
prune
finish
small
cream
head
tops
a
clear
copperbrown
body
thick
syrupy
malt
on
the
nose
hints
of
nuts
the
malt
dominates
the
taste
it
almost
goes
into
the
porter
malt
taste
range
nut
backround
medium
bodied
fairly
creamy
feel
not
a
major
brownhead
but
this
one
isnt
too
bad
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
good
brown
ale
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
them
and
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
in
the
style
new
glarus
is
the
current
wisconsin
boutique
brewery
everything
they
do
is
considered
way
above
average
to
great
in
my
opinion
ratings
for
this
beer
are
an
example
of
herd
mentality
its
just
not
that
great
highly
drinkable
in
my
opinion
nice
and
malty
with
enough
hops
to
compliment
the
toasted
bread
a
fine
balance
descries
this
beer
and
i
very
much
appreciate
it
a
very
easy
drinker
and
one
thats
definitely
good
for
cool
fall
days
pours
deep
copper
with
a
creamy
beige
head
with
very
nice
lacing
smell
is
moderate
with
a
bit
of
a
tinny
note
and
light
hopping
rich
nutty
malt
this
beer
has
a
good
balance
and
reminds
me
of
a
classic
oktoberfest
style
with
a
touch
more
hops
and
pronounced
nuttiness
very
nice
ale
and
quite
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
for
a
brown
ale
slight
drying
in
the
aftertaste
with
all
that
being
said
it
was
gone
before
i
wanted
it
to
be
very
easy
drinking
and
could
be
a
definite
session
beer
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
one
fingered
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
no
lacing
typical
for
new
glarus
beers
a
very
nutty
aroma
is
the
first
thing
that
i
smell
with
a
little
malt
to
follow
the
taste
is
nutty
with
a
little
toffee
and
roasted
malt
to
finish
finishes
dry
and
leaves
a
roasted
nut
aftertaste
the
beer
seems
a
little
thin
for
a
brown
ale
i
expected
something
full
bodied
and
creamy
in
texture
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
new
glarus
brews
the
drinkability
is
also
good
not
a
bad
choice
prosit
mk
i
liked
this
one
smells
malty
but
the
overall
taste
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
typical
brown
ale
like
a
brown
ale
on
the
front
end
with
a
roasted
malty
flavor
but
then
towards
the
end
delivers
a
hoppy
flavor
more
like
a
pale
ale
nice
mouthfeel
nice

mild

and
brit

ale
lovers
will
enjoy
this
one
d
a
nice
brown
session
ale
with
a
great
deal
of
complexity
this
has
enough
interesting
flavors
to
keep
me
interested
for
more
than
one
or
two
pints
and
its
thirst
quenching
enough
to
drink
with
food
i
would
like
to
take
this
on
a
camping
trip
its
very
woodsy
and
nutty
nice
copper
brown
color
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
decent
1
inch
creamy
head
but
that
doesnt
last
long
not
leaving
much
lacing
the
smell
reminds
me
of
roasting
nuts
with
slight
hints
of
spice
this
is
a
malty
beer
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
a
strong
after
taste
that
fades
quickly
not
the
typical
brown
ale
but
despite
the
85
degree
weather
outside
reminds
me
of
relaxing
by
the
fire
on
a
cool
fall
night
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
that
i
enjoyed
pours
a
nice

dark
golden

nice

nice
small
creamy

which
lasts
a
long
time
some
nice
sticky

which
lasts
the
whole
drink
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
bitter
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
bitter
slightly
dry
on
the

nice
dose

medium

drinkable
this
is
an
very
tasty
brew
recommended
very
drinkable
approachable
and
sessionable
ale
perfect
for
spring
fall
or
a
cooler
summer
night
a
great
beer
for
someone
looking
to
branch
out
from
drinking
piss
yellow
lagers
some
of
which
may
actually
be
a
damn
fine
beer
and
move
on
to
trying
something
slightly
darker
ive
come
back
to
this
brew
a
few
times
and
always
been
impressed
and
will
continue
to
come
back
to
this
one
of
my
forebears
slovenia
a
tasty
nutbrown
ale
this
beer
pours
well
a
nice
chestnut
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
largely
diminishes
it
has
a
powerful
maltiness
and
caramel
to
its
aroma
and
these
tastes
predominate
as
well
combined
with
some
subtle
roasted
nuttiness
it
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
leaving
a
slight
stickiness
on
the
tongue
although
it
is
relatively
smooth
and
creamy
d
good
thanks
to
john
wasatch
for
sending
this
one
also
pours
a
clear
dull
copper
hue
with
a
light
khaki
colored
two
finger
that
dies
down
to
a
nice
lacing
a
bit
after
pour
color
of
this
brew
doesnt
seem
to
follow
the
brown
ale
style
a
bit
light
stickiness
is
pretty
good
holds
on
to
the
glass
here
and
there
smell
is
a
sweet
toffee
like
malt
mixed
in
with
spices
quite
dull
not
much
other
than
malt
in
the
nose
starts
off
with
a
smooth
chocolate
like
malt
then
a
woody
like
flavor
follows
towards
the
end
a
bitter
nut
like
flavor
emerges
that
seems
to
come
from
the
hops
light
to
medium
smooth
body
with
little
carbonation
enjoyable
beer
nothing
extraordinary
but
i
could
session
a
few
of
these
its
light
brown
with
good
lacing
smells
of
smooth
roasted
chocolate
grains
the
taste
is
mellow
but
somewhat
complex
it
starts
with
a
creamy
black
licorice
kinda
grain
but
then
gives
way
to
more
caramel
and
cocoa
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
with
a
smooth
finish
complimented
by
a
crisp
touch
this
is
a
great
session
brew
i
stack
it
right
next
to
my
other
favorite
english
brown
the
underrated
ithaca
nut
brown
d
very
drinkable
the
beer
thankfully
lacks
an
overly
nutty
body
that
overtakes
the
rest
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
medium
body
easy
drinker
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
my
first
from
new
glarus
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
around
thanks
to
umustdrink
in
a
nice
trade
i
could
enjoy
this
fine
frosty
a
nice
brew
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
something
that
could
be
drank
from
time
to
time
drinkability
is
good
balanced
and
enjoyable
a
nice
english
brown
another
good
quality
session
brew
from
new
glarus
every
brew
i
try
of
theirs
hits
the
spot
and
this
is
no
exception
d
a
very
full
bodied
full
flavor
beer
great
things
all
around
while
nothing
much
to
look
at
or
smell
it
was
certainly
very
tasty
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
overall
could
pair
well
with
any
nonseasoned
pub
fare
and
might
make
a
great
session
beer
if
i
knew
what
the
abv
was
would
definitely
recommend
it
and
enjoy
every
opportunity
i
got
to
have
it
again
d
this
beer
has
a
some
interesting
malt
complexity
but
the
bright
cider
notes
seemed
to
get
annoying
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
and
covered
some
of
the
malt
flavors
a
very
very
mild
english
brown
possibly
a
good
intoduction
to
the
style
yes
sir
thats
one
fine
nut
brown
ale
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
head
although
not
all
that
big
very
little
lace
nice
brown
color
very
prominant
nutty
malty
toffee
nose
excellent
nut
brown
ale
flavor
better
than
almost
any
that
ive
had
anywhere
velvety
texture
with
fine
carbonation
nice
balanced
finish
perhaps
a
touch
too
rich
but
im
nit
picking
drinkability
a
super
session
beer
with
or
without
food
thanks
to
jj21
for
this
one
poured
from
a
12oz
brown
bottle
into
my
sly
fox
shaker
glass
appears
a
medium
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
minimal
lacing
left
on
the
glass
with
each
sip
smells
of
roasted
nuts
such
as
hazelnuts
and
walnuts
as
well
as
sweet
caramel
malt
tastes
of
toasted
caramel
malts
mildly
bitter
cocoa
powder
and
hazelnuts
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
with
a
satisfying
richness
drinkability
is
excellent
this
beer
will
make
you
forget
newcastle
ever
existed
recommended
the
body
seems
thick
from
all
of
the
caramel
malt
but
at
the
same
time
it
seems
like
it
has
fermented
out
very
dry
and
all
the
remaining
body
comes
from
dextrins
the
carbonation
is
very
crisp
very
easy
to
drink
i
only
wish
new
glarus
would
expand
into
iowa
so
i
could
drink
it
more
often
thanks
for
the
bottle
joe
or
dj
i
suppose
nice
sessionable
browns
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
quite
good
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
could
easily
consume
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
afternoon
or
evening
probably
would
even
make
a
good
breakfast
beer
i
was
expecting
nuttiness
but
i
got
sourness
i
will
try
to
get
a
fresher
example
in
the
future
to
see
if
my
impression
changes
not
bad
at
all
but
ive
had
better
notes
paired
with
a
good
thick
hamburger
or
barbecue
makes
this
brew
superb
a
brown
ale
that
is
assertive
but
not
syrupy
earthy
but
not
dirty
as
inviting
as
the
state
of
wisconsin
one
of
the
better
and
more
elusive
brown
ales
around
enjoy
it
with
a
lover
or
two
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
but
not
very
sticky

found
this
beer
quite
drinkable

amber
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
nothing
to
remark
on
in
terms
of
quantity
but
in
quality
has
a
fairly
pleasant
nutty
aroma
this
smell
nicely
compliments
its
flavor
which
is
pleasantly
malty
especially
for
an
ale
and
has
a
wonderful
nuttyalmost
hazelnutovertone
to
it
i
find
this
beer
to
be
remarkably
drinkable
and
one
of
new
glaruss
better
brews
this
is
an
ok
brown
ale
but
i
really
see
no
reason
to
try
this
again
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
an
english
brown
ale
well
done

another
one
for
wisconsin
semi
hazy
light
mohagany
color
with
a
medium
off
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
a
bit
like
hazelnut
coffee
toasty
some
hoppy
notes
that
toast
and
dry
it
out
taste
is
stronger
on
coffee
than
expected
but
the
nuttyness
really
dominates
sweeter
with
some
milk
chocolate
but
more
of
a
toffee
flavor
roasted
nuttiness
is
still
prevalent
dry
caramel
elements
at
the
top
good
body
but
still
could
use
a
touch
more
fullness
finish
is
a
bit

and

and
ends
clean
another
nice
offering
from

manages
to
combine
the
best

with
complexity

not

some

very
soft
and
slippery
mouthfeel
just
a

heavy
on
the

but
overall
very
smooth
a
pretty
great
stab
at
the
style
from
my
perspective

beer
to

brown

well
made
beer
the
pour
is
a
dark
amber
with
almost
a
red
tint
to
it
the
head
pours
thick
and
cream
colored
then
settles
to
a
good
lace
aroma
is
nice
as
well
with
a
mellow
malt
and
nutty
notes
flavors
are
an
excellent
blend
of
malt
giving
a
distinct
character
to
the
brew
the
finish
gives
the
perfect
bite
of
bavarian
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
lending
well
to
the
excellent
drinkabilty
overall
this
brew
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
nut
brown
ale
and
another
great
brew
from
new
glarus
which
i
might
add
is
quickly
becoming
a
staple
in
my
brew
fridge
d
its
a
nice
easy
beer
to
drink
nothing
special
but
is
a
good
decent
beer
wouldnt
mind
a
few
more
of
these
on
a
relaxed
day
this
isnt
what
id
expect
from
a
nut
brown
ale
with
a
big
fat
squirrel
on
the
label
i
was
looking
forward
to
an
homage
to
the
nut
instead
the
squirrel
stole
all
the
nuts
this
reminds
me
of
too
many
characteristics
of
an
ipa
blended
with
some
aspects
of
a
brown
ale
its
a
weird
middle
where
they
met
and
as
a
fan
of
deep
brown
ales
i
lost
out
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brownishred
color
the
head
is
twofingers
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
identical
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
lacks
any
sort
of
complexity
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
search
it
out
a
lighter
colored
brown
ale
that
pours
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
big
head
giving
off
some
wonderful
nutty
and
toasted
malt
aromas
theres
a
great
nutty
maltiness
in
this
beer
along
with
slightly
roasted
coffee
notes
amid
some
tasty
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
toffee
candy
the
hop
bitterness
seems
somewhat
restrained
with
some
bitterness
contributed
by
the
roasted
malts
this
combination
of
flavors
add
complexity
and
make
this
beer
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
a
future
world
classic
nut
brown
ale
very
nice
brown
ale
here
another
solid
brew
from
new
glarus
wish
i
had
more
frequent
access
to
this
brewery
a
petty
decent
brown
ale
certainly
worth
a
try
i
feel
this
more
of
an
americanized
version
of
a
brown
ale
however
this
is
still
a
good
brew
overall
not
to
bad
i
would
drink
this
one
again
this
ones
tasty
for
sure
im
glad
i
got
a
sixer
thanks
to
ba
doolar
for
hauling
this
one
all
the
way
from
wi
originally
reviewed
april
9
2005
on
tap
at
the
gitchee
gumee
brewfest
2005
the
aroma
was
bland
and
of
plain
malt
but
wow
the
flavors
really
bowl
you
over
theyre
simple
and
fairly
onedimensional
but
you
get
a
good
mix
of
nuts
mostly
domianted
by
roasted
hazlenut
a
personal
favorite
so
this
beer
spoke
to
me
has
a
few
other
weakness
but
pretty
exceptional
for
a
typical
brown
there
is
very
very
little
aroma
to
this
beer
at
all
perhaps
a
faint
hint
of
grains
but
thats
it
the
appearance
is
different
that
i
expected
i
wanted
something
that
was
more
towards
the
brown
and
less
amber
perhaps
it
was
my
light
the
taste
is
very
surprising
roasted
nutty
big
and
flavorful
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
i
think
this
would
be
good
on
occasion
as
a
treat
but
im
not
sure
id
want
more
than
two
at
a
time
i
will
seek
this
out
when
im
back
in
wisconsin
appearance
is
a
transparent
brown
with
some
ivory
foam
the
aroma
is
mildly
sweet
initial
taste
contains
hints
of
nutty
brown
ale
with
caramel
some
hops
rich
malt
with
a
softly
carbonated
middle
finish
has
a
nice
profile
malt
hops
and
a
nutlike
aftertaste
thanks
to
my
buddy
mike
for
leaving
a
six
pack
at
my
cabin
dits
good
but
differentid
have
another
and
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
six
pack
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
as
part
of
a
make
your
own
six
pack
while
in
wisconsin
it
was
my
first
from
new
glarus
and
thought
id
pick
it
up
for
the
funny
label
also
bought
a
shirt
later
at
the
brewery
smells
like
weak
malts
with
roasted
notes
sweet
roasted
taste
thats
very
satisfying
i
do
get
a
bit
of
haxlenut
like
it
says
on
the
label
that
i
should
but
not
a
whole
lot
sweet
roastiness
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
new
local
porter
we
have
in
south
bend
blacksnake
overall
fat
squirrel
was
quite
a
good
offering
and
we
tried
several
more
during
the
course
of
our
trip
d
i
like
this
beer
browns
usually
bore
me
but
this
one
is
more
complex
and
welcoming
than
most
common
browns
lovely
auburncaramel
in
color
with
an
impressive
tancolored
head
thick
longlasting
some
nice
lacing
of
the
glass
surprising
amounts
of
roasty
toasty
in
the
nose
toasted
assortment
of
nuts
here
some
caramel
sweetness
floats
around
as
well
flavor
has
a
firm
backbone
of
sweetness
that
nicely
balances
the
nut
flavors
dark
sugary
caramel
with
some
toasted
almost
charred
oak
notes
slight
zing
of
hop
influence
at
the
end
nice
body
good
carbonation
one
id
certainly
visit
again
pours
a
deep
golden
copper
with
a
pretty
good
head
shrinks
a
little
quick
to
thin
layer
with
minimal
lacing
down
the
glass
more
at
the
top
than
bottom
aroma
nutty
malt
and
slightly
earthy
character
and
a
slight
caramel
malt
profile
overall
a
bit
weak
taste
has
an
overriding
nuttiness
to
it
caramel
malts
too
with
a
smooth
almost
syruplike
mouth
finishes
with
a
light
hop
blending
with
sweet
malt
still
interesting
i
dont
normally
note
hops
in
brown
ales
yet
it
seems
quite
nice
here
something
ill
have
to
look
for
more
overall
quite
a
nice
selection
very
easy
to
drink
probably
one
of
my
more
favorite
browns
in
a
while
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
balance
not
the
tastiest
brew
ive
had
but
its
tasty
enough
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
new
glarus
their
fruit
beers
are
easily
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
their
more
mainstream
offerings
seem
satisfactory
at
best
pours
a
light
browndeep
amber
color
minimal
head
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
carmelly
and
nutty
nice
very
enjoyable
flavor
is
malty
up
front
some
chocolate
and
again
the
hint
of
carmel
minerally
water
taste
but
just
a
slight
bit
of
that
mouthfeel
is
okay
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
afterall
its
a
good
very
drinkable
beer
last
swigs
clean
quaffable
brown
with
a
refreshing
finish
just
lacked
an
angle
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
the
bottle
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
sort
of
like
a
nut
brown
light
and
thats
makes
it
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
wont
fill
you
up
no
hint
of
alcohol
so
i
imagine
around
5
5
or
so
but
really
no
idea
either
way
very
enjoyable
and
the
type
of
beer
you
wish
would
be
sitting
next
to
sam
adams
and
harpoon
in
your
local
bar
id
go
for
it
quite
often
drinkability
notes

easy
drinking
i
havent
had
a
good
brown
ale
in
quite
awhile
a
solid
brown
that
would
be
a
good
gateway
for
a
newcastle
drinker
pours
nicely
and
with
practise
you
can
give
it
a
full
finger
width
of
head
this
beer
smells
very
fresh
like
a
barley
field
in
summer
with
a
hint
of
coffee
flavor
it
feels
full
and
a
little
fizzy
in
my
mouth
and
leaves
a
fresh
grain
aftertaste
with
a
little
coffee
flavor
just
like
it
smells
and
ends
with
a
hint
of
hops
beer
pours
a
hazelnut
brown
with
a
beige
head
and
decent
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
slightly
nutty
taste
is
predominantly
of
nuts
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
almost
a
creamy
feel
to
it
drinkability
great
for
enjoying
just
one
with
an
evening
meal
or
many
with
friends
for
a
night
out
drinkability
quite
drinkable
the
taste
is
clean
with
a
malty
chocalate
and
nut
finish
the
aftertaste
is
pretty
thin
though
decent
mouthfeel
but
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
given
the
opportunity
drinkability
i
could
have
maybe
more
than
one
tafter
one
beer
the
sweet
is
not
cloying
and
the
nuttiness
demands
another
sampling
after
two
beers
i
think
i
would
tire
of
the
sweetness
a
bit
maybe
this
isnt
an
everyday
beer
but
it
is
enjoyable
too
damn
drinkable
for
our
own
good
bottle
from
vinnys
bar
at
la
crosse
airport
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
thin
beige
head
thin
sheets
of
lacing
aroma
of
malt
and
walnuts
medium
body
with
a
roasty
character
lots
of
nutty
and
malty
flavoring
the
finish
is
clean
and
sweet
with
more
malt
and
nut
flavors
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is
creamy
sweet
and
sour
with
an
odd
sour
note
that
seems
to
linger
at
the
end
fours
all
around
for
this
one
i
picked
it
up
while
i
was
at
my
cabin
in
wisconsin
oddly
enough
this
redneck
gas
station
in
birchwood
had
it
pours
a
nice
brown
sweet
sweet
head
and
smells
like
roasted
nuts
it
tastes
on
sweet
sweet
malts
with
roasted
nuts
and
mild
hop
character
so
far
this
is
one
of
favorites
from
new
glarus
and
will
definatly
be
picking
this
one
up
on
my
next
trip
to
the
lake
mouthfeel
is
full
moreso
than
most
of
the
style
which
tend
to
be
on
the
thin
side
drinakbility
is
pretty
darned
good
i
like
this
one
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
1
12
of
beige
head
over
the
dark
copper
brew
head
lasts
well
with
excellent
lacing
aroma
is
nutty
medium
malts
taste
is
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
nuttiness
coming
in
and
a
crisp
lightly
hoppy
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
nice
this
revisit
verifies
that
this
ones
still
good
bottle
provided
by
orbitalr0x
thanks
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
over
a
nearly
clear
brown
rust
liquid
smells
chocolate
nut
toffee
underneath
with
searching
i
get
pancakes
and
syrup
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
alcohol
tastes
toffee
to
start
then
gentle
chocolate
and
sour
then
a
stronger
and
revised
chocolate
sweeter
is
there
a
caramel
undertone
here
ending
with
a
nutty
and
chocolate
finish
some
tannins
may
appear
in
the
end
tough
to
say
as
the
carbonation
rises
a
bit
the
aftertaste
is
rich
chocolate
and
gentle
acrid
carbonation
sting
on
my
tongue
while
this
beer
is
not
complex
it
sure
is
tasty
as
i
progress
down
the
beer
what
i
thought
was
tannin
is
seeming
as
almost
a
roasted
grain
not
quite
coffeelike
but
its
bot
a
bit
of
the
burny
quality
about
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
beer
doesnt
hang
around
long
in
the
mouth
moderate
carbonation
perhaps
a
bit
more
than
id
like
opinion
this
really
isnt
too
bad
of
a
beer
i
like
the
flavor
but
i
think
that
it
is
a
bit
on
the
assertive
side
for
this
style
as
i
mentioned
it
tastes
a
bit
more
like
a
london
porter
than
a
northern
english
brown
ale
flavor
is
suprisingly
robust
for
the
color
the
dark
malts
show
up
much
better
on
the
tongue
than
they
do
to
the
eye
some
astringency
but
not
enough
to
detract
significantly
pours
a
beautiful
fiery
dark
amber
color
head
was
mearly
a
coating
of
foamy
white
a
little
disappointing
but
the
color
is
still
gorgeous
smells
of
sweet
malt
with
some
diacetyl
sour
butteriness
and
a
hint
of
nuttiness
not
outstanding
but
nice
taste
is
much
of
the
same
sweet
grainy
malts
some
hop
bitterness
to
balance
with
diacetyl
and
nutty
notes
to
round
it
off
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
fairly
high
carbonation
that
makes
it
refreshing
drinkability
is
phenomenal
definitely
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
a
solid
nut
brown
and
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
new
glarus
sorry
to
all
you
spotted
cow
fans
out
there
a
clean
beer
that
is
easy
to
enjoy
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
one
but
what
is
going
on
is
good
mouthfeel
is
fairly
average
pretty
thin
but
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
solid
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
drinkability
very
good
for
a
brown
i
would
happily
drink
this
beer
into
my
own
oblivion
the
sharp
bitter
aftertaste
my
least
favorite
character
of
the
beer
would
probably
be
considered
a
positive
by
many
people
on
this
site
the
least
interesting
part
of
the
beer
was
its
scent
odor
sounds
like
feet
new
glarus
is
badass
this
beer
pours
out
a
thin
light
brown
the
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
chocolatey
but
a
little
thin
my
hopes
were
not
high
as
i
took
the
first
sip
i
was
suprised
because
this
beer
is
pretty
good
malt
chocolate
and
nut
flavors
just
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
although
the
beer
appears
thin
the
taste
is
not
weak
very
nice
drinkability
this
is
probably
one
of
the
tastiest
brown
ales
ive
had
mouthfeel
had
a
chewy
medium
body
that
was
creamier
than
most
nut
brown
ales
ive
tried
in
the
past
easily
a
drinkable
brew
but
theres
plenty
of
others
id
choose
first
just
a
bit
too
uninspiring
to
make
me
come
back
for
more
very
light
color
for
an
eba
light
brown
clear
body
head
is
creamy
and
thick
tan
in
color
smell
is
nutty
slightly
sweet
and
backed
bylight
floral
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
nutty
creamy
and
somewhat
chocolatey
hops
are
present
but
are
always
in
the
background
mouthfeel
isnt
very
well
carbonated
and
could
use
some
more
i
like
the
beer
a
good
eba
if
not
a
little
too
normal
drinkability
on
this
is
above
average
it
would
probably
be
a
decent
session
beer
im
glad
i
gave
it
another
taste
unusually
high
carbonation
for
the
style
but
it
works
quite
well
here
crafty
balance
of
malts
and
hops
make
for
an
impressive
american
version
of
an
anglo
brown
ale
this
bottle
is
not
bad
but
different
from
most
others
ive
had
which
is
many
the
difference
is
the
hops
they
are
much
more
pronounced
than
usual
i
am
a
hop
head
so
this
isnt
a
major
problem
but
i
drank
a
nut
brown
tonight
because
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
nut
brown
tonight
oh
well
so
one
batch
is
a
bit
different
from
another
who
gives
a
shit
this
is
still
quite
good
drinakability
is
good
not
a
bad
little
beer
thanks
to
ave
for
the
sample
this
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
no
nutty
tones
here
just
sweetness
the
flavor
has
some
toasted
malts
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
hop
this
is
lacking
what
i
want
from
a
nut
brown
ale
i
really
wasnt
impressed
with
this
drinkability
is
good
and
the
body
is
ok
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
brown
amber
color
with
no
head
and
a
slight
ring
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
not
what
i
expect
from
a
nut
brown
or
english
brown
ale
lots
of
sweetness
that
i
cant
place
the
flavor
is
better
than
what
the
nose
would
say
good
roasted
malt
with
a
nice
nutty
and
roasted
coffee
flavor
nice
nice
nice
the
feel
is
right
at
moderate
maybe
a
bit
more
drinkability
is
also
very
nice
another
solid
beer
from
new
glarus
fat
squirrel
pours
a
beautiful
subtly
hazy
its
bottleconditioned
light
chestnut
body
with
a
crimson
cast
and
glowing
orange
highlights
the
frothy
ivory
head
receeds
to
a
thin
layer
of
cream
and
it
leaves
some
nice
albeit
it
mainly
transient
lace
with
each
sip
the
nose
is
loaded
with
toasty
malt
and
welcomes
you
to
take
a
sip
its
delicately
zesty
on
the
tongue
due
to
its
very
finebubbled
natural
carbonation
the
body
is
medium
and
it
becomes
a
bit
creamier
as
it
warms
toasty
and
slightly
nutty
malt
carries
through
the
flavor
from
start
to
finish
with
some
delicate
floral
and
mildly
spicy
hops
appearing
towards
the
finish
its
solid
bitterness
ushers
in
a
dry
finish
and
toasted
malt
lingers
gently
in
its
long
aftertaste
with
the
occassional
appearance
of
some
floral
and
piney
hops
enjoy
this
one
at
just
below
cellar
temperatures
to
get
the
most
out
of
it
fat
squirrel
is
a
wellcrafted
brown
ale
that
unfortunately
as
far
as
im
concerned
tastes
more
like
coffee
than
anything
else
it
isnt
overpowering
however
and
although
i
would
never
buy
it
on
a
regular
basis
it
was
fine
as
long
as
the
bottle
lasted
another
good
new
glarus
beer
for
which
i
have
skidz
to
thank
this
poured
with
a
big
tancolored
head
that
gave
off
a
malty
nutty
think
hazelnut
scent
on
the
nose
the
head
quickly
subsided
but
it
left
behind
a
light
amber
beer
the
first
sip
revealed
a
very
sweet
very
nutty
flavor
it
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
but
gave
a
great
lingering
nutty
aftertaste
i
found
it
to
be
a
great
accompaniment
to
a
meal
of
wi
brats
drinkability
an
every
day
drinker
of
decent
quality
neither
here
nor
there
but
quite
good
without
having
wowed
me
12oz

this
beer

a
fairly
clear

with
an
offwhite

it
didnt
linger
for
long
the
aroma
is
caramel
malty
with
some
roastiness
a
bit
nutty
also
the
roastiness
comes
through
in
the
taste
with
a
good
malty

behind
it
some
nuttiness

a
very

finishes
softly
with

more
of

this
beer
is
entirely
pleasant
and
perfect
for
a
drinking
session
excellent
beer
dan
and
i
though
i
was
impressed
with
the
native
alebrown
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
all
around
nice
light
syrup
brown
with
a
amber
tone
to
its
slightly
hazy
color
tall
one
inch
cream
colored
head
that
recedes
slowly
to
a
thin
skim
always
present
and
thin
whispy
web
stings
and
patches
aroma
is
dry
and
woodish
slightly
sweet
and
roasty
with
a
nice
overlay
of
nuttyness
hazel
and
almond
i
make
out
pretty
well
but
i
believe
there
is
more
here
then
im
cable
of
putting
my
nose
to
but
its
a
pretty
nice
whiffer
either
way
you
put
it
nice
taster
too
flavor
is
mild
but
stays
long
of
a
nice
little
roasty
maltyness
with
some
nutty
factions
of
almond
candybar
and
hazelnut
a
super
fine
drying
quality
just
keeps
sitting
there
on
your
palate
which
is
quite
extraordinary
the
dryness
produces
a
nice
little
woodlike
dryness
with
a
small
bready
fluffyness
thats
really
nice
solid
medium
body
bold
nearly
full
in
the
middle
lightly
creamy
in
a
way
near
the
finish
along
with
all
the
nice
little
drying
qualities
which
im
really
digging
about
this
beer
subtle
but
flavorful
with
lots
of
things
going
for
it
another
new
glarus
winner
a
session
beer
all
the
way
glad
to
have
picked
this
up
at
ciccones
my
new
favorite
place
to
venture
on
sundays
big
thanks
to
cokes
for
the
sample
smells
roasted
and
nutty
taste
is
very
subdued
roasted
and
nutty
with
some
caramel
the
best
thing
about
this
is
that
the
roasted
and
nutty
flavors
are
subdued
often
nut
browns
provide
too
much
of
these
flavors
my
first
new
glarus
experience
not
blown
away
but
a
very
nice
example
of
a
style
i
dont
particularly
like
the
subtleness
of
the
beer
is
very
much
appreciated
an
excellent
brown
ale
color
is
light
brown
with
an
impressive
vanilla
head
on
top
that
rims
the
glass
nose
is
toasty
and
nutty
flavor
is
toasty
and
nutty
as
well
also
some
caramel
and
breadiness
deepere
in
hops
complement
the
flavor
nicely
this
seems
pretty
fullbodied
for
a
brown
ale
but
still
easily
drinkable
new
glarus
does
not
brew
bad
beers
some
are
just
better
than
others
this
is
one
of
those
that
is
better
than
some
of
their
others
the
beer
is
a
dulled
hazy
copperbrown
color
a
medium
sized
airy
white
head
sits
on
top
and
sticks
around
for
the
duration
rings
are
left
on
the
glass
for
viewing
pleasure
the
aroma
is
pretty
damn
good
for
a
brown
roasted
nut
toasted
malt
and
cocoa
are
the
domineering
players
the
mouthfeel
is
so
creamy
and
nice
body
of
about
medium
toasted
malt
comes
to
the
forefront
on
the
palete
also
a
subdued
roasted
bitterness
a
little
bready
yeasty
touch
is
a
appealing
and
the
nutty
tones
comes
to
play
as
well
this
is
really
a
pleasurable
brown
ale
to
consume
the
epitome
of
a
session
beer
mellow
yet
interesting
and
quaffable
in
large
sums
this
bottle
conditioned
unfiltered
nut
brown
ale

the

a
fluffy
offwhite
light

apparent
tantalizing
aroma
consists
of
caramel
malt
roasted
nuts
and
a
touch
of
oak
the
mouthfeel
is

and
somewhat
fizzy
the
taste
has
a
nice
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
in
combination
with
a
delicious
toasted
nuttiness
midtones
consist
of
melted

in
addition
to
an
almost
pumpkin

more

slight

this
is
a
must
have
for
brown
ale
fans
another
excellent
offering
from
new
glarus
overall
very
nice
simple
tasty
brown
ale
great
for
a
cool
autumn
evening
i
had
this
with
some
vegetable
soup
and
bread
and
cheese
tasty
pairing
as
alstrom
wrote
pour
this
one
hard
into
a
big
stein
to
really
appreciate
truly
a
fallwinter
beer
well
done
the
taste
has
a
decent
sweet
malty
character
with
mild
bitterness
it
was
a
decent
enough
brew
o
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
english
style
brown
ale
and
this
beer
filled
the
void
its
nice
enough
but
certainly
doesnt
bear
the
standard
for
the
style
overall
the
drinkability
and
flavor
of
this
beer
is
good
happy
to
have
scored
this
beer
when
i
opened
up
the
fridge
here
in
old
orchard
me
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
with
a
little
more
complexity
than
is
usually
found
in
the
style
yeah
its
exactly
like
that
and
possibly
even
worse
i
refuse
to
go
back
and
find
out
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
no
matter
how
good
this
stuff
looks
it
cant
compensate
for
the
horrendousness
of
the
taste
its
just
too
much
suck
to
even
think
of
ignoring
it
this
is
some
evil
shit
right
here
my
friends
o
an
excellent
brown
ale
on
the
amtrak
o
very
good
beer
for
the
fall
season
has
all
those
dark
robust
flavors
that
get
you
in
the
mood
for
autumn
i
have
had
gearys
hampshire
special
before
this
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
the
abv
of
that
which
is
what
i
was
hoping
but
does
stay
true
to
that
harvest
style
poured
a
1
5
beige
head
with
average
life
the
body
is
dark
as
coffee
but
held
to
the
light
its
a
deep
burnt
umber
brown
it
smells
mildly
of
roasted
malt
but
really
not
much
else
the
taste
is
mildly
malty
and
has
a
slightly
burnt
aftertaste
its
ok
just
not
really
a
standout
to
me
o
a
nice
offering
from
gearys
not
too
sweet
and
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
definitely
will
have
again
next
year
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
crisp
vibrant
looking
rubyhighlighted
brown
coloring
with
a
shortstacked
head
that
quickly
vanishes
leaving
only
the
slightest
film
covering
behind
the
aromas
are
rich
and
darkly
sweet
with
chocolate
caramel
and
molasses
aromas
there
is
a
smokey
tone
throughout
the
nose
also
flavors
are
extremely
crisp
with
a
good
slightly
sweet
nutty
background
and
some
heavier
sweet
caramel
and
smokey
overtones
a
steady
roast
quality
with
some
dry
pepper
hopping
at
the
end
of
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
roast
coffee
character
and
some
dark
chocolate
flavors
as
well
as
a
slightly
charred
flavor
the
finish
is
clean
and
slick
with
a
slight
sweetness
left
behind
good
flavor
profile
and
blending
overall
making
a
tasty
beer
great
for
a
cool
night
around
a
campfire
o
the
beer
goes
down
rather
easy
and
has
a
rather
complex
taste
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
one
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
not
my
favorite
though
cheers
overall
a
decent
brown
very
unexpected
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
medium
bodied
with
sufficiant
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
a
nice
seasonal
offering
from
one
of
the
local
guys
o
most
of
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
fine
other
than
the
taste
which
is
a
big
downer
for
me
will
pass
in
the
future
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
oktoberfest
biers
and
pumpkin
ales
that
dominate
the
shelves
during
autumn
a
welldone
english
brown
ale
that
plays
up
the
malt
flavors
in
a
big
way
with
satisfying
nutty
and
earthy
flavors
to
match
those
falling
leaves
looks
a
bit
flat
and
viscous
but
take
the
bros
advice
and
give
a
hard
pour
in
a
big
glass
to
achieve
a
head
worthy
of
this
wellcrafted
fall
brew
o
this
is
a
nice
example
of
an
english
brown
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
but
it
still
has
solid
flavor
and
suits
the
season
well
i
really
enjoyed
the
aromas
and
flavors
offered
by
this
fine
fall
seasonal
categorically
the
mouthfeel
may
have
been
a
bit
off
as
mentioned
previously
this
is
certainly
a
beer
worth
a
try
though
pours
very
dark
amber
with
high
fizzy
foam
foam
sticks
but
pulls
away
strong
toffeecaramel
notes
in
the
nose
malt
too
big
malt
taste
with
sneaky
hop
finish
sweet
throughout
some
cola
taste
light
carbonation
makes
it
a
touch
syruppy
good
though
o
every
autumn
since
ive
lived
in
maine
i
always
get
this
my
go
to
autumn
brown
ale
maybe
not
a
standout
but
can
be
found
anywhere
in
maine
clear
reddish
chestnut
colour
quite
dark
with
a
short
cap
of
beige
bubbles
a
bit
of
lacing
decent
head
retention
caramel
malt
aroma
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
apple
a
bit
bready
with
faint
hops
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
nice
flavour
as
well
bitterness
was
restrained
and
let
the
malts
dominate
not
overly
sweet
though
more
of
a
caramel
meets
chocolate
and
dried
fruit
character
light
lingering
bitterness
with
a
bit
of
leafy
hops
the
texture
was
a
little
slick
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
was
slightly
coarse
not
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
on
this
overall
it
was
pretty
tasty
though
i
liked
the
malts
and
thought
the
flavours
held
together
well
drinkability
one
of
my
new
goto
autumn
beers
that
ive
had
this
one
has
all
of
the
characteristics
to
make
a
beer
perfect
for
its
season
the
toasted
malt
profile
is
nicely
balanced
against
the
spice
in
here
and
that
slight
smokey
flavor
really
puts
this
beer
over
the
top
at
5
8
its
an
easier
drinker
and
a
good
one
to
have
around
on
a
cold
autumn
night
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
doesnt
blow
you
away
definitely
one
to
order
at
the
bar
but
then
move
on
from
the
beer
is
a
bit
above
medium
bodied
it
feels
slightly
thick
there
isnt
too
much
carbonation
what
is
there
does
give
my
tongue
a
tingle
i
find
this
seasonal
to
be
quite
drinkable
ive
found
myself
having
a
number
of
bottles
in
an
evening
its
a
tad
too
strong
to
be
truly
sessionable
but
the
alcohol
isnt
very
strong
either
in
flavor
or
potency
which
allows
one
to
consume
most
of
a
six
pack
before
you
realize
what
youve
done
thats
why
i
recommend
going
straight
for
the
12
pack
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
in
my
opinion
a
session
beer
this
is
a
fine
brown
ale
if
you
like
browns
give
it
a
try
the
autumn
is
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
small
head
and
very
little
lace
in
the
glass
the
smell
brings
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
it
comes
out
in
the
beer
as
a
subtle
caramel
flavor
that
being
said
the
autumn
is
not
too
sweet
by
any
stretch
for
me
it
isnt
my
favorite
but
my
wife
loves
browns
and
she
really
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
d
im
a
huge
fan
of
gearys
pale
and
this
is
another
fine
specimen
of
their
brewery
i
would
gladly
buy
another
overall
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
to
be
enjoyed
this
time
of
year
however
nothing
about
it
really
sticks
out
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
some
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
chose
first
d
this
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
awhile
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
a
decent
to
good
autumn
english
brown
overall
i
poured
this
delicious
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
mahogany
color
and
poured
a
wonderful
fat
head
the
lacing
was
really
good
also
the
beer
was
spicy
smelling
and
had
a
really
good
hazelnut
flavor
i
really
liked
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
overall
a
solid
beer
from
a
brewery
ive
never
sampled
before
a
flavorful
brown
ale
that
doesnt
sacrifice
drinkability
for
pretty
big
flavor
d
by
the
end
of
the
beer
i
decided
i
had
enjoyed
it
little
skeptical
at
first
but
as
i
said
it
grows
on
you
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
its
a
deep
brown
like
a
dark
cherryoak
or
mahogany
color
there
is
a
dense
white
creamy
looking
head
with
very
small
bubbles
to
it
that
sticks
around
about
34ths
of
the
session
there
is
a
massive
sheet
of
lace
that
makes
its
way
back
down
to
the
liquid
after
a
few
seconds
the
smell
isnt
very
strong
at
first
its
pretty
heavy
on
the
malt
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
followed
by
some
pine
hops
the
taste
is
a
step
up
from
the
smell
like
the
smell
its
heavy
on
the
malt
accompanied
by
chocolate
and
molasses
with
a
slight
hop
finish
it
starts
off
sweet
and
finishes
off
a
little
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
well
balanced
but
full
bodied
and
the
drinkablilty
is
good
as
well
gearys
has
been
going
downhill
for
the
past
couple
of
years
though
their
pale
ale
and
london
porter
are
still
solid
beers
the
seasonal
offerings
are
underwhelming
a
fine
fine
fall
beer
recommended
d
chocolateyroast
malt
hop
finish
is
a
bit
long
for
a
strong
session
beer
but
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
very
tasty
in
general
nice
earthy
autumn
ale
with
the
leaves
were
falling
and
i
had
a
porch
to
sit
on
sipping
down
this
one
drinkability
is
such
that
i
could
devour
several
bottles
worth
in
a
sitting
the
abv
is
just
right
without
being
so
high
that
one
bottle
has
me
welded
to
my
chair
this
was
a
deliscious
beverage
alltogether
d
gearys
has
been
a
bit
hit
or
miss
in
the
past
but
this
one
is
a
big
hit
rounded
maltiness
with
spicy
hops
and
active
carbonation
compose
a
strong
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
has
some
good
characteristics
but
fails
in
the
taste
category
not
undrinkable
but
there
are
better
choices
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
offering
not
terribly
complex
but
what
brown
is
almost
seems
more
of
a
warmer
type
than
a
fall
offering
ill
have
another
any
time
drinkability
very
good
beer

easy
drink
23
medium
brown
reddish
when
held
to
light
and
very
clear
modest
head
with
some
retention
and
lacing
smell
was
on
the
faint
side
but
pleasant
grainy
malty
and
a
hint
of
something
spicy
taste
was
grainy
and
malty
but
not
as
malty
or
sweet
as
style
would
suggest
and
it
had
a
bitterness
that
came
in
through
the
middle
and
lingered
this
bitterness
was
unexpected
for
the
style
and
out
of
balance
carbonation
was
good
but
the
feel
was
benign
and
thin
drinkability
only
hampered
by
the
out
of
character
bitterness
just
good
not
very
good
not
close
to
great
not
bad
in
the
least
but
not
all
the
much
going
on
pretty
much
my
impression
of
this
beer
was
a
decent
brown
ale
its
deep
flavor
dark
hue
reminded
me
of
more
of
a
winter
seasonal
not
a
fall
seasonal
but
id
drink
it
again
like
i
said
a
decent
brown
ale
i
expected
more
complexity
in
ingredientsspice
notes
for
it
to
be
a
fall
ale
initially
strong
this
falls
apart
and
isnt
really
what
i
was
looking
for
drinkable
but
mostly
disappointing
pass
overall
this
was
a
very
solid
beer
with
a
very
solid
and
very
sweet
flavor
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
having
this
again
and
it
was
one
of
the
better
seasonal
i
had
this
week
mouthfeeldrinkability
aside
from
the
initial
few
seconds
where
the
beer
tears
into
the
front
of
the
tongue
the
texture
then
becomes
superfoam
and
couldnt
be
a
better
canvas
for
showcasing
its
flavors
unfortunately
this
beer
feels
onedimensional
with
regard
to
the
major
hopping
and
almost
nonexistent
malt
id
stick
to
gearys
better
offerings
before
ever
choosing
this
particular
brew
in
the
future
good
stuff
brew
is
right
at
the
top
of
my
list
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
head
that
lingered
through
out
the
drink
the
aroma
of
toasted
malt
and
spices
do
not
cover
up
the
hoppiness
on
the
finish
a
perfect
blend
that
should
be
available
all
year
but
for
now
ill
settle
for
a
few
by
the
fire
pit
on
cool
fall
night
overall
beer
is
not
terrible
but
not
very
good
either
not
much
in
the
flavor
department
seems
unbalanced
mouthfeel
too
thin
in
my
opinion
there
are
too
many
other
outstanding
autumn
brews
for
me
to
buy
this
again
i
was
less
impressed
with
the
taste
the
beer
is
not
much
carbonated
and
is
heavily
skewed
towards
the
sweet
malts
particularly
the
caramel
the
ringwood
yeast
is
apparent
as
is
the
roasted
flavors
the
nutmeg
spiciness
and
some
residual
tea
like
hops
this
is
one
brown
ale
that
i
can
skip
i
think
there
might
be
some
diaceytl
in
there
as
well
but
the
flat
maltiness
mixed
in
with
some
spices
in
the
allspice
family
is
just
too
much
for
my
palate
im
giving
this
one
a
miss
the
toasted
flavors
with
bitter
and
bread
make
this
a
nice
style
that
might
take
some
getting
used
to
you
get
saturated
by
caramel
flavored
nut
browns
on
the
market
and
this
kinda
takes
you
by
surprise
a
good
surprise
decent
and
worth
a
try
and
you
can
have
a
few
not
for
everyone
pretty
good
beer
pours
a
brown
color
mediumbodied
with
a
small
offwhite
head
not
a
strong
aroma
but
a
nice
amount
of
spices
malt
and
a
sweetness
in
the
flavor
some
finishing
hops
to
balance
it
out
a
solid
beer
for
the
fall
season
which
is
a
nice
time
of
the
year
in
the
northeast

nice

when
the
weather
gets
a
bit
cooler
definite
session
ale
as
several
were
quaffed
after
this
review
while
doing
some
yardwork
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
14
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
creamy
crystal
and
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
bit
of
ringwood
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
very
bitter
taste
that
screams
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
it
has
a
faint
crystal
malt
sweetness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
brown
ale
its
too
bitter
for
my
liking
the
malt
bill
doesnt
impress
me
either
a
standard
brown
ale
with
a
touch
of
warming
spice
worth
checking
out
for
the
season
got
a
six
pack
of
this
brew
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
brew
poured
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
it
had
a
good
sized
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
malt
comes
across
with
an
excellent
roasted
scent
mixed
with
a
slight
sweetness
that
highlights
caramel
toffee
and
maybe
a
bit
of
cocoa
the
taste
is
amazingly
smooth
the
flavors
highlight
the
malt
that
was
identified
earlier
the
caramel
and
what
i
think
is
chocolate
really
go
well
together
some
hop
at
the
end
but
for
me
the
malt
flavors
really
set
this
beer
off
i
do
not
do
justice
to
it
with
my
description
but
i
really
like
the
flavors
the
brew
is
extremely
easy
drinking
and
i
wish
that
this
would
be
available
year
around
i
know
i
would
get
it
if
it
were
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
to
just
a
ring
on
the
glass
with
some

aromas
of
fruit
and
spice
and
caramel
taste
fresh
coffee
caramel
with
hints

light
with

was
an
okay
brown
ale
nothing
special
about
it

nothing

this

an
ale
that

amongst
the

not

that

its

that
you
dont

too
often
pours
a
very
deep

very
appropriatley

in

all

ales
should
be
as

virtually
no

a
great

beer
goes
down
easily
seasonals
are
so
good
is
it
bad
to
wish
they
were
available
all
year
a
very
interesting
autumn
ale
and
one
of
the
hoppier
english
browns
i
can
remember
trying
this
isnt
to
say
this
is
a
brown
ipa
but
this
style
doesnt
usually
have
hops
this
noticeable
its
a
nice
change
and
this
would
be
a
brown
that
should
appeal
to
hopheads
and
a
nice
changeup
for
maltheads
can
see
this
going
great
with
aged
cheddar
beef
root
veggies
any
sandwich
on
good
bread
with
cheese
anyone
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
or
just
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
that
should
appeal
to
hop
malt
lovers
alike
should
definitely
seek
this
out
before
the
winds
of
november
blow
it
away
for
another
year
pours
from
the
12oz
bottle
a
deep
brownishmahogony
color
with
a
nice
tight
white
head
aromas
are
lacking
but
mostly
consist
of
slight
spices
and
nutty
malts
nutty
in
the
flavor
as
well
think
walnuts
mixed
with
some
pumpkin
pie
spice
a
nice
beer
overall
certianly
plenty
drinkable
in
the
autumn
months
not
sure
i
will
seek
this
out
again
but
i
was
pleases
with
the
results
deep
brown
with
an
off
white
head
you
can
smell
slight
caramel
and
almost
an
spice
kind
of
like
a
winter
warmer
the
taste
is
slight
caramel
fairly
balanced
but
it
reminds
me
more
of
an
autumn
pale
ale
than
an
english
brown
ale
all
in
all
decent
but
lacking
distinct
flavor
would
grab
again
if
nothing
else
was
available
overall
not
bad
but
the
finish
aftertaste
is
slighty
metallic
clean
this
up
just
a
bit
an
excellent
maybe
even
one
of
the
best
examples
of
an
american
autumn
js
oyster
really
good
seafood
what
a

from
the

and

best
i
have
had
of
this
beer
in
quite
a
while
good
job
ithaca
overall
terrific
brown
ale
i
got
this
in
a
mixed
six
and
would
get
a
full
six
pack
for
sure
the
perfect
beer
for
a
chilly
autumn
or
winter
night
overall
not
awful
just
not
a
stand
out
tends
toward
the
quaffable
overall
not
a
bad
pint
to
be
enjoyed
with
some
good
bbq
on
a
saturday
afternoon
it
would
make
an
fairly
decent
session
beer
on
a
cool
fall
afternoon
overall
this
is
a
style
i
tend
to
overlook
so
im
glad
i
picked
this
beer
up
very
good
example
of
the
style
although
a
little
more
body
would
have
been
ideal
o
this
was
one
of
the
4
original
beers
offered
by
ithaca
beer
no
outstanding
qualities
but
a
solid
brown
ale
hard
to
find
on
tap
but
readily
available
in
bottles
in
the
northeast
o
a
decent
nut
brown
very
easy
to
drink
the
overall
flavor
is
a
tad
too
subtle
and
the
hops
are
buried
by
the
malt
but
its
still
a
relatively
tasty
beer
notes
like
the
dundee
this
is
a
nice
simple
malty
brown
from
upstate
ny
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
easy
drinking
o
i
really
liked
the
nutty
coffee
flavors
in
this
one
probably
not
for
noncoffee
drinkers
but
i
enjoyed
it
o
i
wished
that
this
beer
could
have
been
a
little
heaver
but
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
nice
flavors
well
it
looks
great
in
a
glass
but
that
a
about
it
if
you
like
english
brown
ales
look
else
this
offers
little
to
good
drinking
beers
the
last
sip
taste
wonderful
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
lacks
my
wanting
to
drink
so
move
on
and
keep
looking
for
some
great
beers
pass
on
this
on
its
ok
i
dont
get
much
nut
out
of
it
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hazelnutey
flavor
not
that
great
but
not
bad
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
im
not
pissed
that
its
all
i
have
to
drink
during
this
blizzard
ooga
chakka
booga
filling
up
space
for
two
hundred
fifty
words
o
this
goes
down
really
easy
and
is
pleasant
in
its
unassuming
way
but
theres
no
oomph
to
it
nothing
special
easy
to
drink
and
totally
inoffensive
a
little
more
body
and
better
headcarbonation
would
go
some
ways
towards
making
it
an
entirely
average
brew
overall
great
malty
toasty
taste
with
a
touch
of
roast
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
mine
was
very
flat
o
either
i
was
just
in
the
mood
for
this
type
of
brew
or
maybe
im
just
more
of
a
fan
of
this
style
than
most
nevertheless
i
thought
this
was
tasty
impressive
aroma
of
roasted
dark
malts
with
espressocoffee
tones
and
even
a
hint
of
smoked
oak
the
flavour
isnt
as
well
balanced
as
id
hoped
the
toasted
malt
sweetness
transitions
rather
abruptly
into
a
bitter
finish
with
pleasant
nuttiness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
id
say
its
a
weak
offering
its
good
but
lacks
complexity
and
flavor
that
being
said
id
still
drink
another
probably
at
some
chain
restaurant
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
the
beer
is
an
auburnbrown
coloring
with
a
filmy
yellowish
ring
of
head
aromas
of
roasted
mocha
and
hazelnut
flavors
of
hazelnut
and
peanut
blended
with
a
coffee
backbone
that
is
dark
and
bitter
the
aftertaste
leans
more
towards
the
roasted
coffee
character
with
a
bit
of
an
amaretto
type
presence
slick
roasted
and
slightly
bitter
finish
different
the
stale
coffee
taste
kinda
ruins
this
beer
if
it
didnt
have
that
acidic
gasstation
coffee
twang
it
would
be
damn
good
mouthfeel
is
like
a
dry
stout
medium
bodied
a
little
watery
and
nope
actually
no
carbonation
i
got
a
single
bottle
of
this
and
i
wont
likely
get
it
again
o
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
loved
so
ill
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
one
no
matter
how
many
better
beers
i
try
all
biases
aside
this
is
still
awesome
smell
of
coffee
and
dito
coffee
taste
i
also
thought
that
there
were
some
hazelnuts
in
this
beer
soft
sweet
o
pretty
good
would
purchase
again
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
o
i
do
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
from
a
taste
perspective
its
also
very
drinkable
half
the
beer
is
gone
in
a
flash
but
while
it
is
very
good
it
could
have
been
great
the
dark
almost
porterlike
appearance
along
with
the
hints
of
coffee
on
the
nose
lead
you
to
believe
this
will
be
a
much
heavier
and
stronger
brew
than
it
is
the
very
thin
head
should
have
been
a
dead
give
away
that
this
would
have
a
very
light
mouth
feel
overall
it
was
very
malty
and
i
found
it
to
be
heavily
carbonated
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
there
are
light
notes
of
chocolate
primarily
in
the
aftertaste
but
theyre
easily
lost
in
what
is
an
overwhelmingly
grainy
and
molassesy
flavor
overall
one
of
my
better
favorites
already
when
it
comes
to
the
brown
ale
category
i
would
say
my
3rd
favorite
might
be
a
go
to
in
almost
any
occasion
hope
you
enjoy
cheers
to
all
ithicas
nut
brown
isnt
a
bad
example
of
the
style
at
all
smells
great
but
tastes
just
bit
too
tangy
for
me
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
for
the
style
the
roasty
coffeelike
notes
are
a
little
intense
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
a
pint
glass
the
head
on
this
beer
was
thin
upon
initial
presentation
and
didnt
really
lace
at
all
with
the
first
sniff
of
this
brown
ale
i
was
very
excited
about
the
smell
of
molasses
coffe
and
chocolate
i
am
not
going
to
say
that
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
will
tell
you
from
the
first
smell
to
the
last
drop
i
was
left
less
than
fulfilled
it
lacked
the
body
to
back
up
the
nose
this
would
be
an
okay
beer
to
finish
a
night
of
drinking
o
smells
great
but
overall
just
a
disappointment
o
the
nose
is
quite
nice
with
this
brew
but
thats
where
it
ends
the
taste
just
doesnt
add
up
very
bland
medium
carbonation
fairly
short
and
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
a
nice
brown
nothing
earthshattering
but
very
pleasant
on
a
cool
fall
evening
in
upstate
new
york
i
was
certainly
impressed
with
this
underrated
entry
into
the
brown
ale
category
its
complex
and
drinkable
making
for
one
of
the
best
of
type
available
in
my
childhood
stomping
grounds
of
central
new
york
o
nice
casual
beer
for
the
style
good
for
a
couple
o
certainly
not
a
great
brown
ale
by
any
means
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
ive
had
way
better
nothing
impressive
here
a
decent
coffeenutty
taste
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
slightly
sweet
and
a
little
nutty
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
up
front
that
fades
into
a
subtle
toasted
dry
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
has
a
good
drinkability
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
is
easy
enough
to
drink
several
in
a
sitting
if
you
choose
too
overall
disappointing
head
but
i
loved
the
aroma
and
flavor
and
found
it
to
be
very
refreshing
wish
i
had
another
bottle
skål
d
a
tad
thin
and
clean
not
really
watery
but
at
times
it
feels
that
it
is
leaning
that
direction
needs
more
malt
backbone
maybe
with
a
nice
toasty
grain
biscuity
flavor
still
it
does
grow
on
you
and
is
not
bad
overall
i
really
do
like
the
roastiness
o
its
a
great
nut
brown
definitely
one
worth
trying
if
this
is
a
style
you
enjoy
the
rest
a
decent
nut
brown
that
suffers
from
being
just
a
touch
too
thin
which
is
surprising
given
all
of
the
malt
flavor
and
aroma
in
this
beer
o
fantastic
beer
im
a
stoutporter
lover
and
this
is
right
up
my
ally
nut
brown
from
ithaca
is
a
beer
i
will
absolutely
buy
again
o
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
really
captures
the
nut
brown
malts
and
has
so
much
depth
that
it
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
and
more
great
session
beer
and
i
cant
imagine
this
on
cask
but
i
would
love
to
try
it
it
seems
like
the
bottle
was
gone
before
i
even
realized
it
o
not
had
such
a
big
roasty
presence
in
this
style
and
i
dig
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
and
a
slight
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
thin
collar
throughout
the
nose
brings
a
bit
of
lightlyroasted
malt
plus
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
the
flavor
has
some
brown
malt
and
mild
sweetness
some
caramel
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
light
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
roast
coming
through
toward
the
finish
actually
a
bit
too
dry
for
what
the
flavor
had
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
pretty
standard
brown
id
have
it
again
o
a
very
nice
english
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
style
but
that
doesnt
mean
this
wasnt
good
in
fact
it
was
excellent
othis
beer
starts
well
but
seems
to
fall
flat
as
you
continue
to
drink
it
pours
a
clear
copper
with
reddish
highlights
thin
offwhite
head
lacking
retention
moderately
toasty
caramel
malty
nose
berry
fruity
esters
very
light
in
background
milk
chocolate
moderate
bitterness
caramel
nips
and
toast
continue
through
into
palette
butterscotch
background
short
dry
finish
medium

with
a
moderatemoderate
high
carbonation
the
cpj
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
1
inch
caramel
head
quickly
fades
with
some
residual
lace
smell
right
off
is
chocolate
spice
and
caramel
taste
is
almost
coffee
like
very
nice
actually
with
a
good
hoppy
after
taste
this
was
very
smoothe
somewhat
thick
but
not
overally
so
at
all
its
seems
very
drinkable
and
i
was
suprised
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
for
the
most
part
nicely
balanced
and
i
like
the
nuttiness
in
the
beer
the
sweetness
and
roasted
flavors
are
also
really
nicely
balanced
price
4
00
at
the
stags
head
nyc
overall
nicely
nut
brown
ale
flavors
are
all
there
and
balance
well
together
d
ive
had
this
on
several
occasions
and
have
always
had
some
feelings
of
ambivalence
towards
it
but
this
review
has
opened
up
some
nice
characteristics
i
havent
noticed
before
ithaca
bc
likes
to
put
this
in
many
of
their
sampler
packs
and
is
a
fine
exhibition
of
their
work
well
done
the
reveal
ithaca
nut
brown
ale
i
get
it
its
got
nuts
and
a
backbone
any
single
ladies
would
be
best
to
jump
on
this
one
this
is
a
great
gateway
craft
beer
d
nicely
drinkable
one
of
the
better
english
brown
ales
ive
encountered
just
kinda
average
maybe
it
was
better
when
fresh
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
overall
a
pretty
average
nut
brown
the
best
part
of
this
for
me
was
the
aroma
dn
this
one
has
awesome
drinkability
its
comparable
to
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
one
of
my
favorites
beer
poured
a
medium
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
of
dark
fruits
and
coffee
promising
taste
predominantly
sour
thin
in
texture
with
a
tinny
aftertaste
ok
but
not
great
the
taste
never
delivered
the
richness
of
the
aroma
the
malts
were
not
as
predominant
as
i
had
hoped
12
oz
bottle
pours
brown
with
foamy
short
lived
brown
head
aroma
of
nuts
chocolate
malt
with
hints
of
bread
and
molasses
medium
body
slightly
crisp
some
sore
notes
nutty
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
flavor
with
some
hints
of
citrusy
hops
medium
finish
is
dominated
by
chocolate
and
sweet
dark
fruit
some
metallic
notes
throw
off
the
impression
at
the
end
otherwise
tasty
although
very
average
easy
drinking
brown
i
used
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
couple
red
meat
marinades
and
worked
out
well
there
too
drink
i
was
on
the
fence
with
this
one
i
think
it
might
have
a
little
too
much
carbonation
but
it
was
still
a
decent
beer
probably
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
tasted
it
already
a
great
winter
drinker
this
has
an
amazingly
dark
pour
i
was
very
aggressive
and
poured
into
an
guiness
glass
the
head
dissipated
very
quickly
with
a
very
nice
faint
lacing
the
taste
is
an
amazing
dark
chocolate
flavor
almost
as
if
someone
burnt
the
chocolate
finishes
kinda
nutty
but
has
a
distinct
coffee
aftertaste
i
wasnt
all
that
sold
on
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
have
too
much
carbonation
in
it
drinkability
is
normal
definatly
would
be
good
ham
or
some
other
kinda
pork
product
i
didnt
allow
this
beer
to
have
a
bitter
bottom
because
i
drank
the
last
fourth
all
together
i
did
however
think
it
finished
very
well
drinkable
enough
but
a
bit
thin
and
overly
carbonated
d
thought
this
beer
had
a
dunkely
sweetness
to
it
which
i
dont
necessarily
look
for
but
its
a
decent
fall
beer
you
could
easily
drink
a
few
if
not
for
the
thinner
mouth
feel
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
mislabeled
as
a
brown
ale
overall
it
was
okay
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
and
there
are
other
brown
ales
out
there
that
are
a
lot
better
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
will
not
have
again
once
our
six
pack
of
it
is
killed
eric
poured
very
dark
brown
with
an
average
light
brown
head
aroma
of
nuts
and
coco
taste
starts
off
with
some
unsweetened
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
nuttty
malt
kicks
in
next
a
good
deal
of
hazelnut
was
noticeable
solid
flavor
profile
well
balanced
good
nut
flavor
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
medium
to
high
this
has
some
weight
and
ingredients
that
make
it
a
but
heavier
but
one
goes
down
very
smooth
ithaca
has
better
offerings
for
sure
d
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
this
brown
has
good
potential
in
flavor
but
the
thin
body
astringent
graininess
and
lack
of
true
malt
base
leaves
the
beer
unnecessairly
harsh
roasty
bitter
and
bitey
notes
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
this
one
but
for
me
it
just
stayed
on
the
good
side
of
cloying
pours
a
dark
opaque
colour
not
much
head
or
lacing
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
and
nuts
and
some
coffee
very
nicely
mixed
a
bit
of
wateryness
but
not
much
a
bit
thin
on
the
body
but
very
easy
to
drink
it
will
be
purchased
again
probably
for
the
fall
d
good
brew
not
many
profiles
out
there
like
this
the
biggest
advantage
for
me
was
that
the
beer
stayed
true
to
its
malty
flavors
that
was
expected
i
recommend
it
off
tap
at
the
brewery
this
beer
was
a
gorgeous
garnet
color
with
two
fingers
of
khakicolored
head
the
retention
was
ok
and
the
lacing
in
thin
sheets
the
aroma
was
of
nuts
roasted
malt
and
toasted
malt
the
flavors
were
similar
with
a
delicious
kick
of
nuts
at
the
end
however
it
was
very
onesided
and
pretty
watery
a
session
beer
sure
but
not
a
good
one
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
but
a
bit
slick
the
body
mediumwatery
and
the
carbonation
mediumlow
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
ithaca
d
easy
drinking
brew
d
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
brew
but
i
was
more
than
impressed
considering
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
imperial
stouts
lately
i
am
still
impressed
with
this
beers
strong
complex
and
robust
flavor
the
only
other
browns
i
like
are
mikkeller
jackie
brown
rogue
hazelnut
and
dogfish
india
brown
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
overall
this
fits
the
case
well
as
did
the
cold
frontwarms
and
reveals
texture
as
the
glass
drains
nice
aleish
activity
at
the
finish
however
nothing
really
sets
this
beer
apart
from
its
class
or
its
competition
especially
after
cascazilla
this
one
is
completely
unimpressive
dark
brown
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
cocoa
and
nuts
taste
is
chocolateclub
soda
and
nuts
the
taste
is
kind
of
watery
and
a
bit
weak
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
beer
which
probably
will
not
wow
anybody
its
probably
nice
to
try
once
but
there
is
no
need
to
try
two
it
has
a
thin
mouth
feel
however
it
is
very
drinkable
it
is
smooth
on
the
palate
light
in
alcohol
and
very
approachable
for
both
a
malt
and
hop
lover
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
dogfish
head
snifter
this
beer
pours
a
pale
translucent
brown
with
a
slight
beige
cap
that
quickly
disappears
and
leaves
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
honestly
is
smells
watery
there
is
a
slight
toasted
grain
aroma
mixed
with
just
a
little
bit
of
unsweetened
cocoa
powder
and
a
hint
of
cola
not
much
nuttiness
or
bready
aspects
involved
really
the
cocoa
powder
is
the
i
use
this
term
loosely
dominant
aroma
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
unsweetened
cocoa
powder
just
a
slight
nuttiness
and
toasted
grains
due
to
a
rather
thin
body
for
the
beer
the
toasted
grains
give
just
a
slight
astringency
to
it
thats
noticeable
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
as
stated
before
is
rather
thin
with
a
medium
carbonation
this
is
an
ok
nut
brown
more
on
the
light
brown
side
of
things
drinkability
heady
feel
makes
it
hard
to
pound
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
this
is
a
good
nut
brown
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
nice
dark
color
to
it
with
an
off
white
head
it
has
a
plesant
nutty
taste
with
a
good
aroma
to
the
beer
it
sits
lightly
on
the
palate
and
goes
down
smoothly
i
will
compare
this
to
indian
brown
ale
by
dogfish
head
and
nut
brown
ale
of
roosterfish
brewing
in
order
i
would
drink
roosterfish
indian
brown
ale
then
ithaca
its
a
good
beer
and
not
to
far
behind
the
other
two
too
burnt
for
my
tastes
though
it
does
have
a
nut
character
mediocre
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
fnger
off
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
with
no
lacing
nutty
aromashazelnut
chestnut
with
roasted
malt
and
molasses
all
very
sweet
strong
nutty
flavor
as
well
with
toffee
light
roasted
malt
and
some
sweet
chocolate
medium
carbonation
light
bodied
there
is
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
solid
drinkability
the
aromas
and
flavors
match
really
well
enhancing
this
beer
drinkability
overall
pretty
refreshing
and
wellbalanced
cheers
dexter
we
loved
you
and
will
miss
you
my
big
brown
long
eared
friend
drinkability
i
really
really
like
this
beer
the
malty
and
roasted
flavors
make
this
an
excellent
drinker
with
plenty
of
flavor
i
will
seek
this
out
again
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
in
the
world
but
i
like
what
theyre
doing
with
this
and
could
easily
drink
a
few
especially
in
the
colder
weather
as
it
seems
like
a
good
one
for
the
upcoming
fall
since
im
now
in
new
york
just
finishing
off
this
nut
brown
with
the
label
on
upside
down
for
some
reason
and
thought
i
should
mention
it
actually
ill
give
you
points
on
the
appearance
for
that
but
with
the
dark
color
nice
highlights
and
bit
of
tan
head
thats
quickly
sinking
away
the
aroma
is
chocolate
roasted
goodness
the
taste
is
malty
with
hint
of
nut
in
the
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
but
then
its
a
brown
so
good
for
you
good
co2
a
pretty
good
drinker
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
and
has
a
nice
tight
white
head
that
leave
a
little
lacing
it
smells
like
roasted
toffey
making
you
want
to
take
a
sip
the
taste
is
pretty
good
but
the
bottle
i
have
may
be
a
little
old
it
has
a
firm
bitterness
to
back
up
the
beer
with
a
slight
bit
of
astringency
it
has
a
decent
body
and
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overalli
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
for
sure
rich
roasted
sweet
toffeeish
taste
with
sweet
dark
chocolaty
undertones
and
a
slightly
nutty
bite
also
some
notes
that
resemble
the
taste
of
a
coke
slightly
watery
as
well
the
taste
doesnt
seem
authentic
and
doesnt
mesh
with
brew
taste
is
also
not
very
true
to
the
style
and
too
sweet
at
times
some
breweries
would
brand
this
as
one
of
their
porters
light
in
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
there
are
better
nut
browns
out
there
but
there
are
also
a
lot
worse
i
would
pick
this
up
again
if
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
toasted
malt
with
a
definite
overtone
of
nuttiness
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
that
give
way
to
some
sweet
toasted
malt
with
some
hazelnuttiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
and
slippery
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
frequently
comes
up
in
my
rotation
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
dating
notched
onto
the
label
but
come
on
if
you
only
have
notches
for
months
and
nothing
about
the
friggin
year
what
good
is
that
pours
pretty
typical
brownish
amber
typical

pretty
well
in

brown
i
like
decent
beer
to
turn
on
some
newbies
with
dark
red
amber
glow
up
to
light
light
coffee
left
alone
decent
head
retains
for
most
of
the
session
barely
lacing
aroma
is
faint
light
hazelnut
and
milk
chocolate
really
have
to
dig
in
to
retrieve
it
the
taste
is
soft
notes
of
chocolate
hazelnut
hint
of
light
roast
ending
with
a
slight
tang
quite
airy
and
conservative
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
remain
positive
due
to
the
straight
line
this
ale
walks
very
english
and
not
adventurous
but
satisfying
nonetheless
d
this
beer
is
ok
it
feels
so
light
that
you
could
probably
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
there
are
better
brown
ales
m
d
a
little
sting
on
the
front
before
smoothing
out
slightly
with
a
somewhat
oily
body
the
carbonation
doesnt
even
totally
mellow
out
though
and
continues
to
have
some
bite
all
the
way
down
i
find
this
to
be
a
pretty
pleasant
and
very
approachable
nut
brown
maybe
not
the
best
of
the
nut
browns
ive
had
but
a
solid
choice
and
one
id
happily
go
back
to
without
hesitation

not

d

make
this
easily
drinkable
drinkability
i
read
a
few
of
the
recent
reviews
and
i
think
they
were
a
bit
unfair
to
this
brew
its
a
nice
nutty
brown
ale
that
really
satisfies
what
i
was
looking
for
good
drinkable
brew
that
could
be
above
average
if
it
just
had
a
little
more
body
thanks
again
to
adam
for
his
never
ending
generosity
faint
nutty
aroma
thin
on
the
palate
with
just
faint
caramel
and
nutty
taste
very
weak
did
not
even
finish
mine
disappointing
pours
a
chocolate
brown
color
fairly
light
small
to
average
tan
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
roasted
malt
a
nice
nutty
scent
and
a
hint
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
of
roasted
chestnuts
brown
bread
malt
and
a
touch
of
metal
and
lemon
the
feel
is
rather
light
and
watery
for
the
style
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
fairly
balanced
a
nice
tasting
brown
ale
good
nut
flavors
the
appearance
and
feel
are
a
bit
subpar
overall
a
decent
english
brown
ale
nice
nut
presence
typical
brown
ale
here
very
drinkable
and
full
of
nutty
goodness
this
one
seems
to
be
carbonated
sufficiently
because
ive
seen
other
brown
ales
having
problems
with
that
it
is
what
it
is
a
nice
session
beer
that
was
in
the
mixed
pack
but
im
not
sure
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
on
its
own
great
beer
and
very
nice
i
would
love
this
on
cask
the
abv
is
great
also
making
this
a
great
session
beer
d
id
drink
another
and
regret
not
drinking
this
sooner
pours
extremely
dark
for
a
nut
brown
almost
opaque
medium
head
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
but
maintains
a
fair
balance
rich
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
nuttiness
shows
up
in
the
finish
whats
weird
to
me
is
that
the
alcohol
comes
through
strongly
and
is
somewhat
harsh
not
expected
from
a
lower
abv
would
have
thought
it
was
nearer
8
or
so
thinnish
body
also
unexpected
when
considering
the
dark
appearance
overall
pretty
good
and
drinkable
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
deep
ruby
red
color
with
2
fingers
of
bubbly
tan
head
that
settles
into
1
finger
of
creamy
tan
head
and
good
lacing
smells
of
nuts
chocolate
roasted
grain
and
a
hint
of
citrus

roasty
with
a
slight

acton
ma
who
says
you
need
to
be
big
to
bring
on
the
flavor
this
beer
is
more
flavorfull
than
some
impy
stouts
ive
had
good
stuff
overall
this
particular
batch
like
i
said
was
expired
last
month
although
i
dont
know
how
much
one
months
difference
will
affect
the
taste
it
tastes
rather
washed
down
but
has
lots
of
potential
hopefully
my
next
tasting
of
this
beer
will
be
better
recommended
drinkability
maybe
not
quite
to
style
and
tastes
a
bit
like
a
really
nice
dunkel
but
still
a
very
tasty
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
brown
with
copper
highlights
not
quite
opaque
but
pretty
hard
to
see
through
quarter
inch
offwhite
head
thinned
into
a
consistent
skim
of
foam
generous
watery
lacing
with
some
spotty
adherence
scent
of
malt
and
slightly
nutty
but
fruity
esters
are
also
detectable
reminded
me
of
a
belgianstyle
brew
for
some
reason
in
the
nose
more
flavors
of
malt
caramel
flavoring
is
now
pronounced
with
a
touch
of
sweet
nutty
goodness
slightly
effervescent
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
very
good
session
brown
o
i
like
the
brews
that
ithaca
has
and
this
is
a
good
buy
in
my
case
had
a
2
oz
sample
poured
from
the
tap
at
the
brewery
into
a
glass
tasting
glass
much
better
than
the
plastic
cups
that
some
breweries
use
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
white
head
which
dissipates
minimal
to
no
lacing
aroma
of
hazlenut
and
roasted
barley
flavor
of
roasted
barley
malt
sweetness
with
the
hazlenut
and
hop
flavors
coming
through
in
the
finish
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
and
a
slight
malt
sweetness
lead
to
a
decent
drinkability
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
a
short
light
caramel
colored
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
some
nut
flavors
the
taste
is
just
that
a
sweet
malty
base
with
tones
of
caramel
and
some
nice
nut
flavoring
it
is
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
and
it
isnt
over
or
under
carbonated
i
could
drink
alot
of
these
if
i
were
so
inclined
which
makes
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
pours
a
clear
but
very
dark
ruby
with
no
head
nose
is
subdued
just
barely
a
touch
of
nut
but
not
much
else
really
going
on
flavor
is
nutty
but
oddly
sweet
at
the
same
time
there
isnt
much
going
on
with
that
either
unfortunately
feel
is
kind
of
thick
with
a
slight
syrupy
feel
when
it
first
hit
my
mouth
my
genera
reaction
was
ick
drinkable
i
guess
could
be
sessionable
but
overall
it
is
pretty
boring
and
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
i
think
this
is
the
beer
i
liked
most
out
of
my
12
pack
but
definitely
nothing
to
make
me
pick
up
that
sampler
again
d
the
low
alcohol
and
low
hop
bitterness
make
this
easily
drinkable
would
go
well
with
a
bowl
of
beef
stew
in
the
autumn
months
d
very
drinkable
with
the
5
abv
could
be
a
great
session
beer
excellent
excellent
excelllent
english
brown
ale
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
foamy
head
considerable
lacing
on
the
glass
taste
is
beautiful
with
a
chocolate
mocha
coffee
dominance
sweet
and
just
enough
of
a
bitter
kick
to
it
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
one
t
if
the
caramel
and
nut
flavors
were
stronger
in
the
middle
id
be
ecstatic
di
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
beer
its
ok
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
worth
a
try
if
you
are
curious
pours
well
with
a
deep
ruby
red
color
and
a
quickly
fading
tan
head
a
little
lacing
on
the
the
side
of
the
glass
but
the
smell
is
what
really
gets
me
excited
about
the
beer
a
delicious
malty
nutty
aroma
which
the
flavor
cant
quite
deliver
on
perhaps
a
little
too
much
bitterness
at
the
end
or
not
enough
hops
to
balance
the
malt
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
however
if
you
breathe
deep
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
trying
to
figure
it
out
a
dark
brown
pepsi
type
look
with
average
head
and
lacing
instant
smell
of
toffee
and
worthers
candiesnice
mouthfeel
was
medium
texture
but
did
fizz
on
my
tongue
was
expecting
more
mellowness
taste
was
of
toffe
and
coffe
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
sweet
but
not
overwhelming
solid
looking
forward
to
more
brown
ales
with
summer
winding
down
here
in
new
england
a
nice
dark
coffee
colored
brew
with
a
healthy
tan
head
and
average
lacing
the
smell
is
wholesome
nut
brown
ale
stuff
a
little
toffee
hint
of
chocolate
and
mostly
its
that
good
old
nuttiness
that
you
taste
a
very
smooth
feel
with
perfect
carbonation
for
the
style
refreshing
but
tastey
i
got
a
touch
of
bitter
finish
but
not
much
this
is
just
a
nice
pleasant
brown
ale
probably
a
good
introduction
for
the
uninitiated
on
the
sweet
side
very
nice
da
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
cola
brown
color
with
just
a
tint
of
red
around
the
edges
tan
head
that
dissapears
instantly
no
lacing
to
speak
of
faint
cocoa
smell
and
not
really
anything
else
taste
of
cocoa
toasted
maltyness
and
a
faintly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
also
is
a
little
flat
on
the
carbonation
side
nothing
special
with
this
one
and
i
wouldnt
really
recomend
it
drinkability
possibly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
american
brewed
nut
brown
ales
ive
come
across
the
secret
of
course
is
hops
in
my
eyes
takes
the
rough
edges
of
these
colored
malts
and
blends
them
perfectly
together
a
delicate
hard
to
pull
off
style
ithaca
has
done
a
great
job
here
go
try
one
and
compare
it
with
some
of
the
classic
versions
ie
brooklyn
sam
smiths
and
for
me
wildgoose
part
of
an
assortment
12pack
4
different
ithaca
brews
i
pickedup
at
the
beer
zoo
outside
hershey
pa
this
was
one
of
the
best
of
the
4
though
it
was
a
little
bit
onedimensional
in
the
taste
dark
brown
color
little
carbonation
though
decent
foam
on
top
didnt
last
long
moderate
mouthfeel
smooth
with
a
lot
of
carmel
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
but
thats
about
it
like
a
thick
newcastle
not
a
lot
of
complexity
drinkable
however
i
could
enjoy
this
again
and
i
guess
i
will
i
have
the
rest
of
the
12
pack
to
drink
this
is
an
easily
consumed
ale
very
flavorful
and
aromatica
beautiful
brown
deep
brown
with
a
very
small
tight
cream
head
that
is
gone
quickly
leaving
very
lasting
lace
clear
enough
that
you
can
see
through
it
with
some
light
eh
smells
sweetly
of
caramel
but
more
sweet
than
really
overbearing
caramel
yeah
tastes
well
sweet
and
caramel
but
not
like
caramel
theres
a
lot
of
other
stuff
going
on
in
there
roasted
flavors
but
none
of
the
burnt
business
and
way
light
on
chocolate
or
coffee
maybe
just
the
bit
of
a
tang
of
cascades
as
youre
starting
to
swallow
but
the
finish
is
all
that
roasty
sweetness
sorry
if
i
give
it
low
drinkability
it
just
seems
a
little
off
to
me
i
mean
i
mean
that
little
tang
and
the
aftertaste
are
a
bit
weird
and
oddly
it
seems
sweet
without
much
body
of
course
the
perception
of
sweetness
could
well
just
be
hops
d
its
nice
to
know
that
a
beer
can
be
this
nutty
its
not
all
that
nice
to
drink
more
than
one
beer
which
is
this
nutty
if
the
carbination
issue
was
fixed
i
would
enjoy
this
brew
much
more
right
now
its
more
like
an
almond
joy
corona
ive
brought
this
beer
to
a
few
gatherings
and
all
the
people
that
have
tried
it
have
enjoyed

enjoyed
despite
not
being
the
styles
biggest
fan
im
coming
around
though
prob
a
bit
too

better
than
ending
up
on
the
other

spectrum

give

the
thumbs
up

recco

that
might
be
just
because

could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
with
the
exception
of
some
brew
pub
browns
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
it
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
good
this
came
in
a
mixed
12
pack
but
i
would
almost
by
it
on
its
own
medium
thickness
quite
dry
for
a
brown
nice
feel
not
too
thick
or
bitter
smooth
and
even
a
bit
buttery
a
solid
brown
strong
but
not
too
much
healthy
meaty
but
drinkable
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
to
be
found
no
real
head
retention
but
it
had
a
decent
tan
offwhite
color
when
it
first
was
poured
no
real
lacing
present
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
a
slight
chocolate
scent
in
the
back
ground
hints
of
toffee
sweetness
and
maybe
some
caramel
tones
the
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
with
a
sweet
caramel
aftertaste
the
flavor
had
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
flavor
some
chocolate
tones
were
detected
not
a
very
full
bodied
beer
i
found
it
to
be
rather
thin
it
is
smooth
and
drinkable
no
real
outstanding
notes
it
was
enjoyable
but
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
soda
pop
sweet
brown
not
my
type
of
beer
above
average
carbonation
tiny
wisp
of
a
head
nutty
aroma
they
advertise
and
i
get
only
a
minimum
ofchocolate
malt
caramel
malt
and
four
other
malts
and
hints
of
coffee
northdown
and
fuggles
hops
but
i
do
not
get
much
hops
also
was
a
bit
lighter
on
the
tounge
that
most
porters
very
drinkable
great
with
flame
cooked
meat
its
also
a
beer
that
can
compliment
a
nice
grilled
steak

which
is
always
a
plus
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
easily
the
second
best
beer
in
ithacas
mix
12pack
behind
cascazilla
and
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
in
the
style
overall
a
good
brown
ale
not
the
best
but
good
nonetheless
also
nice
that
it
is
from
nys
had
this
on
tap
at
reds
in
seneca
falls
this
is
definitely
a
brown
ale
you
have
to
try
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
and
nuts
all
mixed
into
one
the
taste
of
this
delightful
brew
is
of
carmel
with
strong
malt
character
im
not
normally
one
for
malty
beers
but
the
drinkability
is
amazing
with
how
smooth
it
flows
down
your
throat
surprisingly
it
is
quite
refreshing
as
well
on
tap
at
mammosers
here
in
hamburgpoured
a
medium
chesnut
brown
with
a
tight
but
thinner
slight
off
white
head
mild
aromas
a
touch
of
roastiness
and
hints
of
cocoa
mainlybasic
brown
flavors
somewhat
roasted
with
a
faint
cocoa
flavor
that
lingers
nicely
fo
a
bit
and
rather
food
friendly
it
went
well
with
some
bbq
grilled
wings
a
basic
but
flavorful
brown
ale
and
it
warmed
me
up
a
bit
wich
is
always
a
plus
bottle
from
a
12pk
sampler
picked
up
at
wegmans
in
syracuse
medium
gold
brown
brew
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
off
sweet
malt
and
plummy
fruit
taste
is
nice
and
balanced
with
malt
flavors
plum
apricot
and
lightly
floral
hops
bringing
up
the
rear
nice
medium
body
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
well
made
and
a
solid
brew
nice
beer
with
good
drinkability
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
tasty
toasted
and
cocoa
flavors
amora
of
light
chocolate
malts
and
grain
just
a
good
quality
english
brown
nothing
amazing
but
a
great
session
beer
sure
beats
the
pants
off
of
newcastle
if
youre
really
into
the
syle
give
it
a
try
otherwise
dont
worry
as
for
drinkability
its
not
a
bad
brown
ale
at
all
the
nice
finish
and
sweet
malt
flavors
save
it
from
its
watery
thinness
but
as
a
fairly
lightbodied
beer
i
think
its
pretty
drinkable
overall
drinkability
is
high
crisp
taste
goes
down
easy
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
a
little
more
carbonation
than
i
would
like
to
see
for
an
english
brown
light
to
mediumbodied
this
would
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
nice
flavor
and
drinkability
seems
like
a
well
done
version
and
one
of
the
better
nut
browns
that
ive
tried
pretty
easy
to
toss
a
few
of
these
back
comments
i
truly
enjoed
this
my
first
sample
of
ithacas
lineup
very
full
flavored
without
being
too
heavy
or
cloying
very
nicely
balanced
look
out
for
this
brown
ale
its
worth
it
artificial
tasting
offensive
at
times
but
mostly
just
an
uninteresting
version
of
the
style
an
average
offering
not
worth
another
try
d
drinkable
nut
brown
but
a
bit
too
ordinary
not
many
things
stood
out
on
this
one
for
me
but
still
worth
a
try
drinkability
overall
an
above
average
beer
but
not
one
i
thought
i
could
quaff
all
day
the
mouth
is
just
thick
enough
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
mildly
sessionable
brown
ale
very
drinkable
because
this
brew
is
so
dry
you
are
forced
to
quickly
take
your
next
sip
its
going
down
fast
and
furious
nice
dark
brown
color
thin
head
that
holds
on
just
barely
throghout
you
can
see
and
hear
the
high
level
of
carbonation
when
you
pour
lots
of
bubbles
smells
earthy
and
nutty
very
satisfying
surprisingly
smooth
with
a
nice
hopmalt
balance
but
tastes
almost
a
little
syrupy
a
few
other
reviews
wondered
if
the
nut
flavor
was
natural
and
i
do
too
stays
sweet
on
the
tongue
and
the
nut
flavor
lingers
leading
me
to
believe
that
its
an
extract
a
little
too
sweet
and
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
but
not
bad
im
editing
my
score
down
a
bit
because
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
less
i
like
it
and
i
only
bought
a
6
pack
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
smallish
white
head
thats
gone
quickly
the
smell
has
coffee
aroma
thats
almost
like
a
porter
the
taste
has
a
creamy
coffee
flavor
thats
very
strong
yet
i
wonder
how
natural
the
flavors
are
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
are
well
mixed
this
is
a
decent
brown
alebut
the
strong
flavors
make
it
hard
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
not
a
bad
looking
beer
crystal
clear
brown
ale
with
nice
white
head
that
is
there
for
the
entire
beer
malty
taste
some
chocolate
nice
taste
nothing
amazin
or
actually
very
good
but
thisis
a
nice
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
be
dissapointed
if
i
had
t
drink
this
in
a
bar
had
this
at
a
real
nice
resturantbar
in
newark
ny
my
frst
impression
was
the
weak
head
how
ever
once
getting
a
wif
of
this
ale
i
couldnt
help
but
think
of
deep
rich
wanut
trees
the
lacking
mouthfeel
was
more
than
made
up
for
in
flavor
however
i
was
hoping
the
whole
time
this
was
naturally
produced
flavor
and
not
from
extract
nice
brew
worth
another
one
just
for
the
smell
as
nut
browns
go
i
feel
this
is
on
top
of
the
list
with
most
of
the
nuttys
i
have
had
this
one
is
not
to
seet
and
has
great
mouthfeel
it
is
actually
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
ever
had
dont
know
if
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
a
lot
of
them
in
one
sitting
but
still
very
very
good
its
very
drinkable
not
so
watery
that
the
flavor
seems
muted
or
diminished
but
its
easy
going
enough
for
two
back
to
back
in
a
short
period
of
time
its
good
drinking
and
while
i
like
this
beer
i
doubt
my
brown
aleloving
friends
would
enjoy
it
as
it
would
be
too
roasted
malt
for
them
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
but
it
fails
as
a
classic
brown
which
to
me
succeeds
when
it
lets
no
one
malt
type
dominates
the
flavor
or
aftertaste
this
noticeably
otherwise
ignore
the
name
and
down
a
few
of
a
tasty
brew
this
is
a
good
beer
nice
subtle
smokiness
behind
a
nice
malt
start
mouthfeel
is
good
for
a
bottled
beer
and
this
one
is
very
drinkable
ithaca
stuff
has
recently
been
introduced
to
litchfield
county
ctso
far
this
one
and
the
apricot
wheat
are
my
faves
this
one
is
a
good
version
of
an
english
brown
clear
rubychestnut
colo
with
a
beige
retiring
head
inviting
aroma
of
sweet
toasted
malt
and
some
hops
flavor
is
surprisingly
smokey
upfront
some
toasted
malt
and
resinous
powdered
cocoa
charred
bark
and
faint
hints
of
honey
and
maple
syrup
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
somewhat
tannic
moderately
carbed
surprised
by
the
smoke
in
a
nut
brown
but
its
a
decent
drinkable
beer
i
should
preface
this
by
saying
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
and
therefore
perhaps
not
the
best
authority
on
them
the
appearance
was
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
brilliant
deep
dark
clear
brown
with
some
golden
highlights
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
also
has
a
nice
head
very
pretty
the
nose
is
huge
and
grainy
with
little
complexity
not
very
appetizing
taste
is
malty
and
quite
sweet
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
hearty
with
lots
of
frothy
carbonation
quite
easy
drinking
i
would
imagine
fans
of
brown
ales
would
like
this
one
last
swigs
brown
ales
tend
to
be
boring
imho
but
this
one
actually
has
some
grainy
oatmeal
goodness
tasty
but
still
a
brown
thanks
to
ithacabaron
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
feel
is
smoothly
set
within
a
lightmedium
body
with
a
easy
carbonation
thats
not
boastful
for
a
brown
toastyness
is
light
and
paled
nuttyness
is
touched
on
with
grace
and
finishes
better
then
it
starts
a
welcomeing
little
brown
ale
drinkable
and
sessionable
with
an
open
margin
to
boredom
due
to
its
lack
of
depth
and
light
flavors
this
beer
was
just
average
for
me
pours
a
nice
brown
color
tan
head
went
away
too
quick
the
beer
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
it
has
a
dry
finish
that
left
a
chalky
taste
in
my
mouth
it
think
this
is
a
personal
taste
issue
with
me
other
folks
my
like
this
beerso
give
it
a
shot
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
roguesharbor
in
landsing
served
in
a
typical
pint
serving
tumbler
when
it
came
to
my
table
it
had
a
dull
off
white
flat
head
it
was
a
dark
rubybrown
color
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
quickly
faded
and
with
little
fanfare
not
much
lacing
it
had
a
nice
malt
smell
a
great
start
not
much
of
a
bitter
hint
to
it
at
all
although
not
much
of
a
nut
flavor
not
like
a
troegs
nut
brown
hops
were
toned
down
nicely
it
had
a
delightful
semicreamy
mouthfeel
and
went
down
way
to
easy
althoughat
this
point
there
wasnt
much
carbonation
left
dont
know
if
it
was
the
tap
system
or
the
brew
itself
overall
i
would
have
another
and
am
excited
to
try
one
out
of
the
bottle
this
weekend
a
niceyet
uneventful
product
give
it
a
shot
some
day
drinkability
is
medium
but
is
hindered
by
the
carbonation
and
is
far
too
sweet
to
be
followed
by
a
second
tasty
the
smell
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
the
head
barely
makes
it
to
half
an
inch
it
pours
a
really
nice
dark
brown
amber
color
the
taste
is
greatttt
i
noticed
chocolate
flavors
and
nutty
malts
also
a
little
coffee
it
is
smooth
and
syrupy
while
at
the
same
time
a
tad
watery
im
not
really
picking
up
the
fruityness
that
the
others
are
but
this
is
really
sweet
anyways
in
my
opinion
this
is
so
much
better
than
a
newcastle
plus
you
dont
get
that
nasty
english
sewege
smell
poured
a
transparant
browndeep
ruby
color
not
much
head
but
pretty
good
lace
smells
of
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
taste
is
of
course
roasted
malt
with
coffee
and
chocolate
tones
but
it
also
has
a
fruityness
to
it
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
its
very
unique
adds
another
dimension
to
what
would
otherwise
be
an
average
brown
ale
high
carbonation
leaves
a
nice
roasted
aftertaste
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
decent
drinkability
bender
factor
another
sweet
session
brew
from
ithaca
interesting
that
the
smell
is
so
complex
and
the
mouth
is
so
intermixed
perhaps
some
smoothing
out
in
needed
i
truly
enjoy
their
sampler
pack
now
its
available
here
in
the
blo
looking
forward
to
a
long
awaited
trip
to
ithaca
brewing
boring
probably
good
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
dark
beers
might
be
a
nice
gateway
brew
had
this
brew
last
evening
actually
finished
the
6
pack
that
i
got
a
few
weeks
ago
the
brew
poured
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
thick
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
around
the
top
half
of
the
beer
glass
the
aroma
has
what
i
call
an
earthy
tone
with
highlights
of
coffee
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
a
pretty
nice
smelling
brew
the
tastes
seem
to
be
highlighted
by
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
that
lead
to
a
nutty
like
flavor
i
do
not
notice
much
of
a
hop
taste
or
aroma
from
this
brew
over
all
i
like
it
not
a
favorite
but
it
is
a
new
york
product
so
i
have
an
interest
i
would
get
this
again
but
it
will
not
be
one
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
locate
finger
lakes
nut
brown
is
a
decent
dark
lager
but
as
an
english
brown
ale
it
falls
short
one
could
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
say
that
perhaps
the
brewers
were
shooting
for
the
light
end
of
the
style
spectrum
but
im
not
inclined
to
be
that
generous
while
not
by
a
large
margin
its
worse
than
my
average
it
may
have
been
affected
by
travel
and
storage
but
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
body
and
texture
of
the
beer
seem
bruised
dangerously
close
to
but
not
actually
syrupy
not
enough
bubbles
and
thin
in
some
unidentifiable
sense
i
remember
enjoying
the
first
bottles
of
this
sixer
a
lot
more
than
this
one
reminds
me
of
the
czech
lagers
i
had
that
tried
to
mimic
a
roasted
ales
tastes
the
chocolate
does
mix
very
well
with
the
cheese
ill
say
pours
a
coppery
brown
color
with
a
shortlived
beige
head
grassy
nutty
and
malty
aromas
with
some
hints
of
chocolatecoated
hazelnut
and
brown
sugar
initially
sweet
then
turning
oddly
astringent
in
its
malt
maybe
its
hops
though
not
completely
detectable
nuttiness
pretty
nonexistent
in
its
taste
leafy
hoppiness
showing
up
more
as
it
warms
pretty
good
but
not
the
best
example
of
its
style
first
imperial
pint
glass
pours
with
a
12
beige
head
which
laces
well
deeply
reddish
brown
brew
with
a
slightly
nutty
caramel
malt
aroma
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
caramel
malts
with
a
slightly
nutty
aspect
but
there
is
also
a
slightly
sour
fruity
flavor
mouthfeel
is
average
i
would
want
a
bit
more
heartiness
of
grain
in
a
nut
brown
drinkability
is
a
bit
better
with
some
interesting
flavors
to
catch
your
fancy
and
smooth
yet
somewhat
thin
body
that
lets
you
enjoy
one
after
another
good
malt
characteristics
slightly
nutty
though
not
overtly
little
to
no
hops
pleasant
everyday
brew
that
i
wish
i
had
had
more
of
while
up
in
ithaca
for
college
strange
that
the
flavor
could
be
so
simple
when
the
aroma
was
rather
complex
a
very
nice
beer
that
did
not
blow
me
away
but
one
that
pleased
me
quaffable
not
a
stellar
brown
ale
but
i
didnt
hate
it
i
had
this
and
their
apricot
wheat
in
the
same
sitting
and
i
actually
liked
the
wheat
ale
better
a
bit
more
body
would
help
immensely
with
a
lower
more
english
style
carbonation
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
ut
brown
its
not
bad
but
it
had
a
few
flaws
that
could
easily
be
fixed
the
taste
was
chocolate
with
a
coffee
aftertaste
i
was
slightly
bothered
by
a
slight
metalic
taste
it
kind
of
tasted
mediciney
the
colour
was
nice
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
the
smell
was
of
chocolate
i
dont
feel
good
drinking
it
i
feel
very
uncomfortable
with
it
very
dependable
brew
but
do
not
expect
something
mind
blowing
here
just
a
basic
brown
ale
color
was
dark
mahogony
with
an
offwhite
head
smell
was
roasted
without
too
much
in
the
way
of
distinction
taste
had
a
nutty
beginning
moving
more
into
a
roasted
malts
taste
in
the
middle
with
a
small
hop
bite
in
the
finish
carbonation
was
a
problem
here
as
there
was
waaaay
too
much
of
it
considering
the
style
good
beer
to
wash
down
some
bbq
with
and
i
did
just
that
the
taste
is
a
lot
of
nutty
roasted
malt
as
youd
expect
by
the
name
its
also
got
a
certain
sweetness
and
a
little
pear
at
the
end
hops
appear
to
be
an
afterthought
but
that
really
adds
to
this
beers
smoothness
carbonation
is
just
wee
bit
too
much
for
a
malty
dog
like
this
one
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
should
note
ive
heard
this
is
not
nearly
as
good
in
the
bottle
as
it
is
on
tap
since
i
live
5
minutes
from
the
brewery
ive
only
ever
had
this
ontap
i
will
buy
a
bottle
soon
and
do
another
review
for
that
so
that
i
may
address
these
questions
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
laces
the
top
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
of
toasted
malts
and
nuts
the
taste
is
good
a
nice
balance
between
pale
crystal
and
victory
malts
there
is
low
hopping
and
a
nice
brown
type
aftertaste
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
is
quite
drinkable
im
from
this
area
and
drink
this
beer
often
the
nut
brown
ale
is
one
of
their
best
sellers
and
best
tasting
beers
its
not
the
best
one
of
this
style
but
its
also
not
the
worst
bottom
line
a
good
core
offering
from
ithaca
brewing
this
is
a
good
nut
brown
that
is
rather
drinkable
and
would
definitly
buy
again
however
i
think
i
was
looking
for
stronger
malt
flavors
and
more
lacing
theres
toffee
malt
and
a
little
chocolate
in
the
nose
the
front
is
deep
and
malty
toffee
a
nice
touch
of
fruit
pops
up
in
the
middle
plums
theres
also
lots
of
chocolate
and
a
little
coffee
with
burnt
sugar
the
finish
is
fresh
leaving
toasted
grains
coffee
and
chocolate
i
really
quite
like
this
notes
not
a
bad
brown
ale
but
not
entirely
inspiring
its
basic
to
its
core
but
thats
just
fine
with
me
still
tasty
and
worth
a
try
had
this
on
a
visit
to
the
finger
lakes
overall
perception
is
of
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
grains
deep
brown
color
with
very
little
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
enjoyable
beer
a
fine
example
of
the
brown
ale
style
mediumfull
bodied
rocky
tan
head
interesting
delicate
brew
from
wells
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
think
if
they
had
gone
bigger
with
the
abv
and
had
some
more
body
it
wouldve
been
even
better
rather
sweet
with
a
very
distinct
malt
flavor
almost
drinks
like
a
semisweet
coke
or
something
mouthfeel
is
like
water
couldnt
finish
it
smooth
not
sticky
pleasant
smell
true
to
name
very
sweet
but
not
bad
i
thought
the
beer
was
entirely
to
sweet
the
ladies
enjoyed
i
will
pair
this
with
some
type
of
dessert
nice
sweet
start
but
an
artificial
aftertaste
2
5
out
of
5
taste
pleasant
toffee
flavor
nothing
else
really
not
at
all
to
my
taste
sweetbitter
and
just
too
i
dont
know
unbeer
like
had
13
of
a
bottle
and
had
to
dispose
of
the
rest
couldnt
finish
this
one
cream
sodaish
taste
was
just
a
little
too
overwhelming
not
a
fan
this
was
a
fun
beer
albeit
somewhat
unimpressive
its
a
deep
dark
caramel
color
with
a
tiny
amount
of
caramel
colored
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
cream
soda
and
vanilla
taste
is
much
the
same
its
very
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
are
super
prominent
there
is
very
little
alcohol
to
hide
in
this
one
it
feels
thick
and
creamy
again
hitting
a
serious
cream
soda
vibe
for
me
it
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
but
it
is
pretty
onenoted
and
leaves
something
to
be
desired
this
is
beer
on
training
wheels
if
you
really
like
cream
soda
and
are
interested
in
getting
into
craft
beer
but
could
never
handle
those
yucky
beerflavored
beers
meet
you
new
favorite
beverage
as
for
me
though
id
prefer
to
keep
my
pudding
and
beer
separate
from
each
other
ill
be
generous
nice
aroma
interesting
taste
drank
in
bath
tab
with
nice
girl
and
salami
i
cant
give
it
bad
mark
just
unimpressive
in
general
very
little
flavor
its
almost
like
drinking
a
beerd
version
of
brown
sugar
so
good
definitely
not
a
strong
brew
and
not
something
that
will
win
best
beer
since
it
doesnt
fit
the
stereotypical
bourbon
barrel
aged
or
india
pale
ale
mold
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
unique
this
will
fit
the
bill
o
just
like
with
the
banana
bread
beer
the
aroma
is
very
powerful
and
convincing
while
the
rest
of
the
beer
leaves
me
going
eh
not
as
bad
as
the
score
lets
on
especially
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
like
me
dont
write
this
off
try
it
original
and
balanced
enough
to
be
a
great
winter
warmer
without
too
much
alcohol
and
a
good
dessert
beer
o
2

what
a
total
let
down
this
beer
was
the
aroma
was
so
promising
this
beer
simply
needs
more
sweetness
a
lot
of
it
the
aroma
is
as
decadent
as
be
but
misleading
as
well
as
the
beer
is
hardly
sweet
at
all
bland
but
when
mixed
half
and
half
with
the
wells
banana
its
a
lot
better
very
tasty
beer
toffee
is
very
dominant
sweet
flavor
smooth
and
fairly
light
feel
m
mouthfeel
is
full
very
little
carbonation
no
head
whatsoever
and
lacing
isnt
present
average
beer
at
best
imo
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
producing
only
a
finger
of
frothy
tan
rapidly
diminishing
head
that
leaves
a
thin
cap
slim
surface
ring
otherwise
little
lacing
aroma
is
vanilla
extract
butterscotch
toffee
with
vinous
acetic
hints
in
a
brown
ale
base
taste
is
fronted
by
creme
soda
vanilla
butterscotch
toffee
on
toasted
brown
bread
a
hint
of
cocoa
mixed
in
mineral
water
with
much
less
acetic
no
vinous
hints
finishing
with
roasted
nuts
a
note
of
bitterness
thrown
into
the
mix
aftertaste
is
creme
soda
burnt
maltcola
caramel
light
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
watery
but
smooth
thinly
creamy
we
got
this
as
a
gag
and
were
quite
surprised
that
it
was
actually
rather
good
i
think
drinking
one
is
more
than
enough
but
its
kind
of
like
drinking
dessert
instead
of
eating
it
sweet
malty
beer
with
some
bitterness
but
not
too
much
toffee
is
very
discernible
not
heavy
like
i
thought
itd
be
if
you
like
sweet
beers
youll
love
this
one
the
bottle
design
isnt
top
notch
but
the
beer
itself
is
delicious
too
odd
for
my
tastes
fun
try
cola
not
much
head
less
lace
sweet
nose
taste
is
best
part
sweet
but
not
too
cloying
mouth
thin
not
very
balanced
and
a
one
off
try
body
has
a
nice
dark
walnut
color
pale
head
lacks
froth
smell
is
subdued
although
toffee
definitely
appears
above
the
bitter
english
style
hops
as
it
warms
flavor
is
very
good
from
the
start
much
like
an
english
brown
ale
solid
mouth
feel
with
a
good
balance
of
carbonation
and
viscosity
this
was
my
first
im
actually
heading
to
the
fridge
for
another
as
we
speak
good
beer
was
leery
about
trying
this
the
name
sounds
disgusting
enough
received
in
a
mix
n
match
6
pack
for
christmas
and
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
was
pleasantly
surprised
low
marks
for
appearance
because
i
couldnt
coax
a
head
out
of
this
with
the
hardest
of
pours
mouth
feel
was
rather
thin
and
disappointing
as
well
smell
was
excellent
lots
of
vanilla
but
kind
of
one
dimensional
taste
of
sweet
vanilla
no
bitterness
and
very
drinkable
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
this
thing
had
an
awful
label
tho
lol
another
great
offering
from
wells
i
am
in
love
with
their
banana
bread
beer
and
now
this
as
well
it
pours
a
deep
but
brown
color
and
immediately
you
catch
the
aroma
of
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
gives
off
a
sweet
nutty
character
but
a
dry
finish
makes
it
perfect
not
too
sweet
just
enough
i
really
enjoy
the
refreshment
of
this
beer
this
should
be
a
desert
beer
after
any
good
meal
i
highly
suggest
trying
this
one
bottle
body
of
the
beer
is
brown
but
clear
head
is
tan
and
readily
and
steadily
laces
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
sweet
and
brimming
with
sugars
caramel
breads
and
toffee
of
course
i
decide
that
one
hefty
sniff
is
enough
to
know
what
i
am
getting
into
and
dive
right
it
toffee
caramel
butterscotch
mild
chocolate
sweet
breads
generic
sugar
candy
all
sweet
body
isnt
very
heavy
but
it
feels
a
bit
sticky
and
sugargrainy
splitting
a
12
oz
was
the
right
choice
here
as
this
is
not
the
type
of
beer
that
tends
to
impress
me
that
being
beer
intended
to
solely
taste
like
a
food
or
another
liquid
hopefully
wont
be
drinking
this
again
a
little
thin
as
others
have
noted
but
surprisingly
nottoosweet
in
fact
there
is
an
overriding
bitterness
that
makes
it
all
the
more
drinkable
the
toffee
smell
hits
immediately
but
tastewise
is
not
too
cloying
nice
carbonation
good
cling
on
the
glass
mighty
impressive
for
a
uk
beer
attempting
the
craft
market
id
drink
this
more
than
i
should
too
sweet
for
a
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
light
tan
head
toffee
and
pudding
notes
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
with
some
light
sweetness
and
a
little
bitterness
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
a
pedophiles
dream
come
true
candy
in
a
bottle
wed
all
get
in
the
van
for
this
except
david
he
is
holding
out
for
ryans
buckeye
d
this
was
an
odd
brew
with
a
scent
and
taste
that
didnt
fit
the
target
character
the
body
was
weak
and
the
finish
wasnt
very
smooth
so
it
wasnt
so
easy
to
drink
this
seemed
like
the
sort
of
beer
that
an
american
brewery
like
southern
tier
could
have
nailed
but
wells
really
missed
the
mark
overall
not
a
prominent
toffee
taste
there
is
a
sweetness
with
gives
flavors
of
butterscotch
candy
and
creamy
butter
also
a
little
bitter
okay
to
try
for
a
novelty
beer
but
not
something
that
i
would
get
again
not
one
i
would
want
to
drink
all
the
time
but
not
bad
for
a
novelty
dessert
beer
very
good
not
overly
sweet
or
heavy
pours
a
dark
ruby
brownish
clear
with
a
medium
beige
head
light
lacing
a
pleasant
aroma
of
toffee
pudding
butterscotch
and
caramel
fill
the
senses
the
aroma
carries
over
to
the
taste
with
a
flavorful
sweet
toffee
butterscotch
upfront
that
slowly
mellows
out
on
the
end
with
some
caramel
malt
and
mild
bitter
notes
for
balance
on
the
end
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
some
stickiness
on
the
lips
the
finish
same
as
taste
with
some
lingering
toffee
and
butterscotch
flavor
this
is
a
good
flavorful
brew
that
actually
follows
thru
with
its
namesake
overall
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
this
was
very
very
good
too
thin
and
too
sweet
for
my
liking
not
horrible
but
not
great
wells
does
dessert
and
its
a
modest
example
its
refreshing
to
see
a
change
from
the
common
chocolate
infused
dessert
beers
on
the
market
tolerable
in
one
11
2oz
serving
but
id
not
want
to
session
this
at
least
not
without
a
dentist
appointment
to
follow
ive
never
had
a
sticky
toffee
pudding
but
if
this
is
a
good
representation
of
what
one
tastes
like
then
ill
add
it
to
the
list
of
english
foods
best
avoided
not
a
short
list
quite
disappointed
for
what
i
thought
this
would
be
worth
a
shot
but
for
only
one
time
it
taste
as
its
labeled
my
girlfriend
loves
wells
banana
bread
beer
so
i
got
this
for
her
to
try
i
had
a
sip
and
it
was
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
she
on
the
other

to

a
nicely

offering
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
o
a
nice
concept
but
the
base
beer
needs
to
be
a
little
bit
maltier
to
hold
up
to
the
sweetness
still
pretty
drinkable
though
o
not
very
good
not
worth
trying
for

a
4
pack
and
the
cigarette
butt
stays
with
you
for
a
while
amazing
reddishbrown
clear

wow
aroma
of
caramel
cream
nice
ok
head
and
average
lacing
tastes
of
coffee
toffee
and
whipped
cream
pretty
awesome
balance
and
i
think
this
is
my
dessert
feels
ok
on
the
palate
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
burnt
caramel
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
pretty
average
example
of
an
english
brown
ale
the
base
beer
was
noticeable
but
it
didnt
come
off
as
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
the
toffee
did
work
well
with
it
and
it
didnt
completely
take
it
over
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
crisp
slightly
creamy
not
too
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
i
dont
have
any
urge
to
drink
another
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
to
me
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
and
they
were
both
good
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
drinkability
they
just
werent
as
good
as
i
hoped
they
would
be
and
since
they
took
the
lighter
approach
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
flavors
that
made
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
a
little
pricey
for
what
you
get
and
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
it
may
be
worth
a
try
to
see
how
you
feel
about
it
all
in
all
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
if
the
taste
was
more
like
the
aroma
i
know
i
would
like
it
more
but
as
it
is
it
left
me
wanting
more
from
this
beer
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
or
of
the
style
i
would
say
its
right
in
the
middle
between
a
english
brown
ale
and
a
dessert
beer
and
thats
a
little
confusing
i
appreciate
you
guys
doing
something
a
little
different
but
in
the
end
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
better
luck
next
time
guys
good
taste
but
very
dry
at
the
end
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
bold
with
toffee
ans
hints
of
pudding
the
taste
is
dry
and
not
as
bold
as
i
expected
the
flavors
are
weak
bit
it
does
deliver
an
interesting
flavor
o
gimmicky
niche
not
all
that
it
could
be
its
a
shame
that
these
are
the
ilk
of
ales
that
wy
seems
to
want
to
push
over
here
double
chocolate
banana
bread
likely
by
virtue
of
their
popularity
could
this
be
construed
as
an
insult
to
americans
id
be
curious
to
talk
with
one
of
their
us
reps
to
see
whats
up
with
this
crap
not
that
ill
pass
up
a
bombardier
in
protest
any
time
soon
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
overall
its
not
too
bad
its
interesting
but
not
great
its
a
let
down
compared
to
their
banana
bread
beer
i
would
drink
it
if
someone
bought
it
for
me
but
i
wont
purchase
this
beer
again
i
was
expecting
a
thicker
sweeter
beer
its
a
tad
sharp
on
the
tongue
and
goes
down
smooth
with
a
bit
malt
i
have
no
idea
how
they
came
up
with
this
name
i
taste
no
toffee
or
pudding
its
thicker
but
i
was
expecting
more
out
if
this
overall
this
has
the
sweetness
of
a
sweet
imperial
stout
but
the
complexity
of
a
subtle
brown
ale
the
mix
is
not
entirely
a
success
for
those
who
like
dessert
beers
however
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
three
finger
khaki
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
dark
brown
color
no
highlights
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
toffee
nose
and
flavor
is
toffee
then
some
hop
bitterness
not
bad
but
a
one
time
good
deal
for
me
3
49
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
o
good
with
some
drawbacks
too
watery
mouthfeel
lacking
will
buy
again
sometime
in
the
near
future
though
glad
to
have
tried
it
3
755
overall
this
beer
is
a
huge
disappointment
considering
how
well
the
british
normally
do
maltbased
beers
i
saw
the
label
and
name
and
immediately
fell
in
love
with
a
fusion
of
my
two
favourite
things
sticky
date
sticky
toffee
pudding
and
beer
unfortunately
this
is
an
awkward
bitter
and
metallictasting
disaster
rather
than
a
sweet
and
heartmelting
beauty
add
a
price
of
au92
for
an
equivalent
case
of
24
x
330ml
bottles
and
this
one
is
a
definite
nogo
at
least
the
alcohol
wasnt
detectable
in
this
had
it
been
it
would
have
made
this
even
less
impressive
than
it
was
as
a
novelty
i
liked
this
but
it
was
hard
to
take
seriously
as
an
english
brown
ale
or
a
dessert
beer
this
would
be
be
suited
for
washing
down
something
sticky
and
toffeeflavored
but
as
is
this
was
too
weak
to
fully
enjoy
by
itself
worth
a
go
once
just
to
see
what
any
fuss
would
be
about
o
this
beer
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
the
ratings
imply
its
still
very
uneven
o
very
drinkable
but
honestly
very
average
500ml
bottle
bb110914
poured
an
enticing
bright
amber
brown
with
frothy
beige
head
aroma
of
caramel
vanilla
and
raisins
on
tasting
it
the
most
noticeable
thing
is
how
watery
it
is
an
initial
hit
of
molasses
sweetness
gives
way
to
an
unappealing
hint
of
bitterness
creamy
texture
but
the
body
is
oh
so
light
i
was
hoping
for
something
luscious
and
decadent
a
bit
like
a
sticky
toffee
pudding
instead
i
got
a
watery
english
brown
with
some
caramel
essence
not
happy
jan
overall
this
beer
elicited
a
collective
meh
from
me
and
my
coconspirator
it
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
great
either
just
mediocre
i
certainly
wouldnt
buy
it
again
and
i
am
glad
we
didnt
pay
for
it
overall
an
excellent
dessert
beer
great
for
what
it
is
but
one
and
done
unless
you
are
in
the
mood
to
sit
and
eat
an
entire
can
of
frosting
if
the
latter
is
the
case
then
you
may
want
to
bring
home
a
six
of
this
the
feel
is
the
traditional
light
medium
of
an
english
brown
some
dryness
brings
a
bit
of
slightly
chalky
character
after
a
sweet
start
though
the
sweetness
is
never
lost
its
pretty
smooth
with
a
nice
creaminess
underlying
a
soft
crispness
the
mineral
aspect
sometimes
feels
like
it
thins
out
the
body
at
points
in
some
english
ales
and
it
does
ever
so
slightly
here
well
done
though
all
said
well
this
offering
certainly
brings
the
toffee
and
a
few
of
its
less
illustrious
friends
but
eventually
succumbs
to
a
not
altogether
pleasant
and
sort
of
tackedon
drying
binge
yes
there
is
a
disjointed
thread
running
throughout
like
two
sides
that
cant
seem
to
just
get
their
shit
together
and
work
things
out
ah
well
im
sure
i
would
have
been
wanking
on
about
the
lack
of
balance
otherwise
so
damned
if
you
do
and
so
on
i
cant
imagine
drinking
bottle
after
bottle
of
this
all
night
but
its
definitely
worth
having
one
or
two
of
it
smelled
delicious
had
an
initial
taste
that
was
kind
of
bitter
then
a
really
sweet
aftertaste
that
was
exactly
like
toffee
it
was
really
weird
i
wish
i
tasted
more
toffee
when
it
was
still
in
my
mouth
the
difference
between
that
and
the
aftertaste
was
too
extreme
given
to
me
a
few
months
ago
its
sat
in
my
fridge
ever
since
until
now
very
odd
beer
i
guess
its
aimed
at
toffee
fans
overall
really
tasty
and
full
of
caramel
not
cloying
i
liked
this
a
lot
o
its
a
caramel
bomb
is
that
a
thing
i
expected
some
off
or
weird
flavors
it
is
very
unique
but
not
bad
i
think
this
would
be
a
decent
dessert
beer
i
cant
think
of
a
lot
of
other
occasions
that
would
warrant
this
beer
for
some
reason
the
taste
reminds
me
of
the
holidays
so
i
will
amend
that
and
say
that
this
might
be
nice
any
time
you
think
youd
like
to
drink
egg
nog
pours
a
dark
brown
color
14
inch
head
of
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
sugar
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
yeast
fits
the
style
of
an
english
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
pale
malt
strong
sugar
strong
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
yeast
overall
sugary
sweetness
dominates
both
aroma
and
body
this
is
a
subpar
beer
sticky
toffee
pudding
pours
a
dark
and
deep
brown
color
with
a
long
lasting
tan
head
there
is
a
sweet
creamy
aroma
with
big
sweet
toffee
notes
the
taste
has
a
bitter
and
nice
malty
bite
then
finishes
very
creamy
and
sweet
with
lots
of
toffee
flavors
near
the
end
good
creamy
flavors
good
feel
nice
flavors
overall
the
name
doesnt
lie
taste
like
toffee
pudding
o
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
its
a
combination
of
an
english
brown
and
a
watered
down
version
of
burnt
cream
soda
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
repeat
pours
a
clear
very
dark
reddish
mahogany
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
of
course
toffee
taste
begins
with
some
bittersweet
toffee
then
some
roasted
grain
and
then
some
vanilla
the
finish
is
tart
with
a
bit
of
an
odd
sweet
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
decent
beer
though
the
toffee
flavor
just
seems
out
of
place
in
a
brown
ale
poured
from
330
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
5232014
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
not
knowing
what
to
expect
from
a
beer
with
a
name
like
this
the
beer
poured
an
amber
color
and
poured
an
amber
head
the
head
was
nice
and
big
the
beer
smelled
like
vanilla
but
the
taste
of
vanilla
was
not
overpowering
like
the
vanilla
porter
i
have
had
from
another
company
toffee
also
was
in
the
smell
and
taste
with
a
bit
of
maple
taste
the
beer
had
great
lacing
and
i
love
the
taste
i
would
buy
again
its
just
a
mediocreatbest
brown
ale
with
some
fairly
subtle
toffee
pudding
sorts
of
qualities
this
beer
doesnt
taste
bad
by
any
means
its
incredibly
drinkable
and
certainly
pretty
unique
in
its
flavor
but
for
the
price
and
idea
of
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
far
different
if
somebody
like
founders
or
some
other
sort
of
critically
acclaimed
brewery
were
to
make
a
beer
like
this
it
surely
wouldnt
turn
out
like
this
again
its
not
a
bad
beer
as
its
drinkable
and
fairly
tasty
at
5
abv
but
really
3
for
a
single
bottle
wouldnt
buy
it
again
it
tastes
fairly
cheap
for
a
not
cheap
price
wow
what
a
wierd
experience
highs
and
lows
and
a
feel
that
actually
ruins
the
flavor
i
love
this
whole
craft
thing
drinkability
this
one
is
interesting
i
do
get
toffee
and
light
pudding
but
maybe
not
the
stickiness
the
taste
is
very
much
frontforward
and
is
not
as
strong
as
the
beer
lingers
i
would
get
this
again
if
it
was
offered
but
prefer
the
banana
bread
beer
this
beer
is
a
fail
it
smells
a
bit
like
the
pudding
its
supposed
to
evoke
but
the
taste
is
of
burnt
sugar
with
a
watery
aftertaste
very
thin
and
one
dimensional
and
a
disappointment
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
earthshaking
but
i
did
at
least
hope
it
would
have
some
body
and
substance
oh
well
dark
colour
mild
head
medium
carbonation
pleasant
toffee
fragrance
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
yet
peppy
good
ale
flavour
sweet
at
the
front
more
bitter
at
the
back
notes
of
toffee
caramel
a
nice
dessert
beer
crank
up
the
abv
a
point
or
two
dial
back
the
fakey
caramel
this
wouldve
been
much
better
was
hoping
for
so
much
more
poured
from
an
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
stemmed
glass
showed
a
dark
brownruby
ale
with
a
small
off
white
1
finger
head
aroma
hold
sweet
carmel
and
toasted
malts
releasing
more
as
it
warms
the
carmel
toffee
comes
out
as
it
warms
as
well
toasty
flavor
but
missing
the
creamy
pudding
anywhere
that
i
could
taste
had
a
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
as
with
brown
ales
flavors
are
there
but
i
might
have
to
revisit
this
one
again
3
more
in
the
fridge
to
have
the
toffee
and
pudding
happen
overall
a
little
let
down
with
the
total
flavor
since
the
banana
bread
beer
by
wells
was
right
on
spot
still
glad
i
picked
it
up
as
i
love
to
try
new
brews
food
match
complementing
this
with
a
sticky
toffee
pudding
would
be
interesting
otherwise
roasted
pork
or
pulled
pork
would
work
well
with
this
along
with
some
german
cuisine
like
pork
neck
or
knuckle
yeah
i
seem
to
have
a
pork
fixation
with
this
brew
for
some
reason
o
overall
its
an
alright
beer
but
its
very
misleading
when
i
read
sticky
toffee
pudding
ale
i
want
something
that
tastes
like
caramel
and
is
sweet
low
on
bitterness
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
that
sticks
to
the
tongue
this
delivers
none
of
that
overall
nothing
too
fantastic
here
sweet
and
sugary
but
way
too
weak
overall
in
body
and
feel
not
really
one
i
would
likely
go
to
again
unless
on
nitro
which
i
think
may
really
fit
this
beer
rather
nicely
a
chestnut
brew
with
a
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
lace
this
beer
is
interesting
it
has
an
enticing
aroma
toffee
sugar
sweetness
cream
caramel
not
a
normal
beer
aroma
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
leads
you
to
believe
it
has
a
mild
spiciest
and
a
more
than
expected
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
lot
lighter
than
expected
the
beer
could
do
with
a
bit
more
body
still
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
doesnt
last
long
some
light
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
very
nice
of
toffee
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
of
caramel
toffee
hits
your
tongue
up
front
a
slight
bitter
finish
is
noted
as
for
sticky
pudding
not
really
not
sweet
at
all
either
overall
it
wasnt
too
bad
the
body
is
a
dark
brown
almost
cola
like
with
no
head
to
it
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
coming
from
from
it
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
coffee
coming
through
and
some
roasty
ness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
could
be
a
nice
desert
beer
o
if
you
can
get
past
the
name
and
preconceptions
and
consider
it
as
an
englishstyle
beer
i
think
you
might
be
mildly
surprised
assuming
you
enjoy
or
appreciate
similar
beers
however
its
still
no
more
than
a
decent
balanced
per
my
definition
offering
the
taste
is
good
with
moderately
sweet
malt
flavors
which
have
both
caramel
and
dark
sugar
in
the
sort
of
nutty
way
with
some
chewy
malt
roastiness
and
slight
raisin
in
the
yeast
with
gentle
hint
of
spice
overall
i
was
glad
i
tried
this
but
probably
wont
order
this
or
pick
it
up
again
since
it
is
more
of
a
novelty
similar
to
the
double
chocolate
in
my
opinion
overall
on
the
fence
it
delivers
what
it
promises
so
if
you
expect
anything
outside
of
a
sticky
toffee
pudding
beer
youre
just
playing
stupid
although
not
quite
as
super
sweet
diabeetus
as
expected
like
southern
tier
creme
brulee
but
still
quite
sweet
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
backbone
but
the
toffee
definitely
dominates
not
overly
sweet
at
all
certainly
a
guilty
pleasure
of
a
beer
huge
toffeecaramel
aroma
initially
though
after
pouring
it
fades
quickly
to
merely
prominent
rather
than
excessive
not
much
head
retention
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
sweet
but
not
cloying
or
thick
balanced
enough
to
be
more
than
a
onetime
novelty
but
not
so
balanced
that
it
fails
to
distinguish
itself
as
a
unique
style
the
sweetness
and
aroma
make
it
appealing
to
people
who
ordinarily
dont
ilke
beer
this
is
the
first
time
my
wife
asked
for
a
bottle
of
a
beer
i
had
her
taste
while
still
being
appealing
to
people
who
do
like
beer
me
at
least
i
have
got
to
say
even
though
sweet
dessert
beers
tend
not
to
be
my
preference
i
was
excited
to
give
this
one
a
try
i
am
a
fan
of
wells
banana
bread
so
hopes
were
high
smell
is
great
sugar
toffee
even
an
aroma
that
invokes
thoughts
of
pudding
or
more
accurately
cakes
and
baked
goods
nice
lacing
of
white
foam
as
it
settles
in
a
snifter
initial
taste
is
pretty
spot
on
sweet
viscous
enough
to
make
you
think
pudding
but
not
overall
and
the
flavor
hits
second
taste
and
on
it
begins
to
lose
my
attention
the
flavors
dissipate
the
mouth
feel
begins
to
be
much
to
thin
to
carry
the
big
flavor
it
wants
to
also
carbonation
is
somewhat
tricky
it
seems
too
much
when
the
beer
tastes
thin
and
lacking
in
the
beginning
overall
interesting
and
hope
they
tweak
the
recipe
and
release
it
also
since
everyone
else
is
barrel
aging
some
nice
bourbon
barrels
might
make
a
great
beer
the
coffee
flavor
is
felt
at
the
end
of
the
drink
good
color
the
aroma
is
intense
not
a
cloying
flavor
drink
on
hot
days
is
not
advisable
i
was
not
going
to
like
me
but
its
a
very
enjoyable
drink
the
label
has
a
striking
design
the
bottle
could
be
bigger
the
price
is
very
affordable
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
sweet
and
toffeeish
immediately
almost
an
artificial
smell
to
it
so
much
so
that
i
expected
a
very
sweet
beer
beer
itself
is
not
sweet
at
all
and
so
it
makes
my
taste
buds
a
bit
confused
not
much
body
or
carbonation
feels
a
bit
thin
overall
a
nice
sweet
smelling
beer
that
is
lacking
in
taste
sticky
toffee
pudding
ale
is
a
tale
of
two
tastes
its
early
flavor
sells
its
namesake
well
while
the
promise
of
any
stickiness
pretty
nice
caramel
chocolate
cake
aroma
with
a
bit
of
cola
thrown
in
it
taste
petty
much
like
it
smells
just
to
a
lesser
extent
all
around
some
roasty
coffee
flavors
as
well
think
it
would
be
much
more
appealing
overall
if
it
was
a
bit
creamier
maybe
nitro
or
something
also
never
a
fan
of
adding
caramel
color

i

is
the

served
in

the
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby

with
almost
a
half
inch

head
retention

there
isnt

is

sweet
the
brew
smells
like
toffee
butterscotch
and
caramel
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
some
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
noticeable
too
just
like
the
aroma
its
a
very
sugary
sweet
tasting
brew

is

its
a

i
thought
this
was
ok
but
id
only
recommend
this
if
you
like
sweet
tasting
beers
2

a
single
tried
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
i
tend
to
like
sweet
beers
so
decided
to
give
it
a
run
good
looking
beer
that
has
an
interesting
smell
that
is
nothing
special
taste
was
very
good
probably
what
some
like
but
not
what
i
was
looking
for
while
a
good
beer
it
was
nothing
that
i
would
probably
buy
again
o
ive
never
had
sticky
toffee
pudding
but
the
rich
and
sticky
dessert
qualities
of
this
beer
are
not
lost
on
me
that
part
of
the
brew
comes
across
quite
obviously
the
beer
beneath
is
rather
lacking
however
if
you
have
a
big
sweet
tooth
this
might
be
a
guilty
pleasure
sort
of
beer
for
you
otherwise
theres
not
a
lot
offered
here
bottle
dated
121114
dont
know
if
thats
mmddyy
or
ddmmyy
but
either
way
thats
a
long
way
in
the
future
for
a
5
ale
overall
as
with
the
wells
banana
bread
its
another
tolerable
onetime
flavored
beer
for
me
saleswise
it
lacks
the
whaaaa
factor
of
the
banana
beer
o
everything
seemed
hastily
put
together
not
enough
caramelcream
aroma
or
flavor
too
much
hops
not
thick
or
creamy
at
all
it
did
have
moderate
components
of
toffee
pudding
but
ultimately
came
up
quite
short
stick
to
their
more
ontarget
cheaper
more
available
banana
bread
beer
if
youre
looking
for
the
alcoholic
liquid
recreation
of
desert
food
o
not
great
but
doesnt
disappoint
i
held
nothing
back
on
my
pour
and
was
rewarded
with
two
fingers
of
dense
rocky
lightbrown
head
with
decent
retention
for
my
trouble
color
was
a
deep
brown
srm
x
with
garnet
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
was
sickly
sweet
really
quite
like
sticky
toffee
pudding
butterscotch
is
not
the
precise
term
for
the
smell
but
it
drops
you
off
in
the
neighborhood
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
thankfully
the
taste
was
nowhere
nearly
as
rich
as
the
nose
led
me
to
expect
that
said
it
was
still
quite
sweet
very
much
like
liquid
caramel
or
toffee
no
hops
were
harmed
in
the
production
of
this
brew
thats
for
sure
it
was
not
cloyingly
sweet
but
the
longer
that
i
drank
through
the
330
ml
involved
the
more
that
i
was
thankful
that
there
was
not
more
of
it
the
beer
finished
in
the
semisweet
range
not
enough
to
be
considered
downright
sweet
but
still
much
more
sweet
than
i
would
ever
find
enjoyable
id
have
another
go
at
this
not
a
bad
ale
really
a
bottle
was
opened
for
sharing
at
pins
it
caught
my
eye
so
how
could
i
say
no
darker
copper
color
clear
with
a
small
tan
head
that
sank
to
a
ringlet
leaving
a
few
dots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
sweet
with
toffee
and
vanilla
taste
of
caramel
malts
sweet
toffee
butterscotch
candy
maple
syrup
toasted
cereal
grains
finished
off
a
bit
nutty
with
almost
no
hop
character
to
speak
of
at
all
body
was
lightmedium
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
with
a
residual
stickysweet
sensation
carbonation
was
on
the
lower
side
overall
id
say
its
worth
a
try
but
really
just
more
of
a
novelty
id
imagine
this
would
go
good
with
a
plate
of
belgian
waffles
though
also
would
probably
be
interesting
to
try
from
a
cellartemp
cask
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
with
butterscotch
pudding
taste
is
butterscotch
toffee
some
sweetness
unique
and
tasty
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
mouth
and
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
this
is
worth
a
shot
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
red
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
is
appropriate
lots
of
sweet
toffee
hints
of
nuts
brown
sugar
flavor
is
mild
toffee
lightly
nutty
light
caramel
malt
surprisingly
light
flavored
light
to
medium
bodied
the
flavor
is
as
expected
lots
of
caramel
and
dark
sugar
but
not
as
cloyingly
sweet
as
one
might
fear
unfortunately
the
good
choice
of
sweetness
level
seems
to
come
at
the
expense
of
flavor
intensity
it
tastes
good
but
almost
watered
down
and
finishes
rather
abruptly
although
there
is
a
mild
lingering
toffee
aftertaste
an
interesting
light
ale
with
interesting
flavor
but
needs
a
bit
more
intensity
a
pleasant
one
to
try
but
probably
not
to
revisit
body
is
too
light
for
the
flavours
appears
a
deep
crimson
brown
hue
with
a
beige
flowing
head
fine
speckled
even
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
a
candy
like
toffeecaramel
note
with
a
bready
base
ale
lying
underneath
the
flavor
additions
flavors
are
very
tame
a
dirty
muddled
roasted
malt
layer
finishing
earthy
with
a
metallic
penny
like
flavor
a
hint
of
caramelized
sugarstoffee
the
nose
carries
out
the
sticky
toffee
pudding
much
better
than
the
palate
picks
up
those
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
mild
carbonation
a
bit
of
astringent
metallic
notes
lingering
between
sips
overall
a
very
forgettable
beer
i
dont
even
think
the
same
folks
who
go
crazy
over
their
banana
bread
beer
will
think
much
about
this
offering
rjt
the
aftertaste
is
very
nice
and
caramely
followed
by
a
slightly
dry
and
roasted
feel
pours
a
clear
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
toffee
and
metallic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toasty
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
has
a
decent
caramel
and
toffee
aroma
but
the
taste
is
oddly
metallic
and
detracts
from
the
drinkability
nice
winter
beer
to
have
so
easy
to
drink
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
accurate
to
the
description
on
the
bottle
however
this
one
screams
for
a
thicker
fuller
bodied
mouthfeel
to
live
up
to
its
full
potential
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
slight
head
and
very
slight
lacing
nose
is
roasty
with
tons
of
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
a
bit
of
a
bitter
and
pungent
flavor
with
slight
hints
of
the
sweet
components
present
in
the
nose
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
prost
lampertland
surprised
to
see
this
at
my
local
was
gonna
pick
it
up
tomorrow
from
favourite
bottlo
but
couldnt
resist
the
thought
of
it
tonight
and
on
pour
its
a
very
dark
brown
hue
with
creamy
one
finger
head
and
some
subtle
lacingthe
smell
reminds
me
of
a
subdued
creme
brûlée
from
southern
tier
along
with
toffee
malts
and
a
slight
herbalnessfor
a
beer
trying
to
represent
a
pudding
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
do
it
justice
its
just
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
and
the
tastes
are
basically
a
really
malty
english
brown
ale
with
strong
tastes
of
toffeecaramelmilk
chocolatedark
malts
and
finished
with
a
watery
caramel
finish
and
overall
yeah
its
not
for
me
and
definitely
doesnt
live
up
to
what
they
say
on
the
label
and
i
wont
be
buying
again
cheers
decided
to
revisit
this
after
several
years
since
it
was
fresh
on
tap
at
the
brewery
one
word
outstanding
blew
bells
jupiter
out
of
the
water
on
tap
at
the
troegs
brewery
bit
too
dark
for
a
brown
ale
but
still
a
nice
brown
and
not
amber
color
wonderful
silky
white
foam
very
tasty
and
with
pleasing
lacing
to
the
bottom
of
the
pint
the
flavor
profile
was
robust
a
good
smooth
blend
of
grain
flavors
with
a
nice
hop
kick
the
word
was
that
the
batch
had
been
more
highly
hopped
than
in
the
past
for
rugged
trail
it
was
posted
as
5
2
abv
and
50
ibu
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
brown
its
too
bad
brown
ales
arent
the
american
beer
du
jour
these
days
happy
that
troegs
brought
this
back
so
that
i
could
finally
review
it
cheers
o
a
nice
very
palatable
brown
ale
too
acidic
and
rancid
for
true
balance
in
my
taste
but
certainly
has
a
strong
set
of
flavors
that
dont
apologize
for
each
other
bravo
for
the
effort
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
despite
shortcomings
in
its
components
this
brew
is
a
bit
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
it
can
be
drunk
rather
rapidly
as
it
is
without
offending
and
it
sits
beside
complex
foods
very
nicely
on
its
own
though
it
just
gets
a
little
mundane
back
on
tap
at
the
brewery
after
a
couple
of
years
on
hiatus
pours
a
deep
clear
ruby
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
nice
retention
that
leaves
a
rich
smattering
of
lacing
down
the
sides
the
aroma
smells
of
floral
and
green
citrus
notes
with
a
light
sprinkling
of
toasted
nuts
and
cocoa
along
the
back
the
taste
switches
things
up
being
more
sweet
and
nutty
and
just
a
smidgen
of
dark
fruit
up
front
before
giving
away
to
bitter
tingle
of
earthy
citrus
flavors
dry
and
bitter
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
firm
creaminess
to
the
carbonation
that
flows
nicely
in
the
mouth
its
good
to
have
the
rugged
trail
back
as
it
is
a
nice
and
slightly
americanized
take
on
an
english
brown
ale
id
hoping
this
is
the
first
of
many
return
appearances
for
this
beer
original
review
on
10192010
o
it
was
really
cool
they
brought
rugged
trail
back
because
i
never
had
the
chance
to
try
it
when
it
was
in
full
production
this
one
is
really
easy
to
drink
but
i
wish
there
was
more
nuttiness
or
roastiness
to
cut
the
sweetness
i
poured
this
from
a
growler
it
has
a
dark
magonay
color
body
with
a
2
tan
head
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
and
nuts
the
taste
starts
off
a
little
sweet
then
the
taste
of
roasted
nuts
come
through
on
the
middle
to
back
of
the
tongue
great
mouth
feel
and
overall
a
really
good
brown
ale
o
i
am
glad
to
see
this
one
back
around
all
be
it
for
a
short
period
of
time
i
have
missed
this
one
dearly
as
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
low
abv
make
it
very
sessionable
i
shall
get
my
fill
while
it
lasts
easy
to
drink
quite
delicious
overall
while
i
do
like
the
flavors
in
this
ale
they
seem
weak
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
a
copper
color
with
a
larger
one
finger
head
to
it
it
has
a
smell
that
contains
roasted
nuts
malts
carmel
faint
hops
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
roasted
malts
coffee
nuts
some
chocolate
mf
is
medium
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
a
decent
brown
ale
but
nothing
that
is
going
to
blow
you
away
yeah
its
a
brown
ale
not
really
my
style
at
all
pours
a
murky
walnut
brown
with
a
small
layer
of
white
bubbles
for
a
head
nutty
sweet
aroma
a
bit
buttery
toasted
malts
in
the
taste
nutty
again
sweet
diacetyl
and
a
bitter
finish
not
entirely
bad
but
just
too
sweet
for
me
perhaps
medium
body
and
not
something
id
want
to
drink
again
aka
most
brown
ales
had
this
back
on
32209
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
so
far
so
good
the
aromas
werent
bad
it
was
semi
sweet
with
some
bitterness
on
the
nose
too
the
flavor
just
wasnt
all
there
for
me
not
sure
why
it
just
didnt
seem
right
kind
of
a
little
disappointing
d
very
drinkable
lots
of
nutty
flavors
that
blend
really
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
the
beer
is
fairly
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
nicely
balanced
served
in
a
pint
glass
rugged
trail
pours
a
deep
brown
color
that
is
bordering
on
black
the
head
of
this
brew
is
about
a
halfinch
thick
foamy
and
disappears
quickly
leaving
a
small
amount
of
lingering
lacing
on
top
of
the
beer
as
the
beer
is
drank
however
it
leaves
absolutely
no
lacing
on
the
glass
which
is
quite
typical
for
the
style
this
nut
brown
ale
has
the
exact
scent
i
had
anticipated
for
the
style
with
nice
scents
of
roasted
nuts
and
a
slight
underlying
caramel
or
molasses
note
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
absolutely
spectacular
the
nut
flavor
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
slight
sweetness
and
the
roasted
character
giving
an
incredible
depth
to
the
brew
that
i
have
not
seen
in
many
other
nut
brown
ales
the
only
other
nut
brown
i
have
had
that
could
match
up
with
this
brew
is
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
which
i
thought
was
also
astoundingly
flavorful
contrary
to
what
i
had
expected
given
its
depth
of
flavor
and
distinct
character
rugged
trail
drinks
impeccably
smooth
and
light
overall
i
absolutely
loved
this
brew
and
i
must
say
im
quite
disappointed
to
find
that
it
is
retired
d
this
is
one
easy
drinking
troegs
beer
as
most
of
them
have
been
light
and
roasty
flavors
make
for
a
good
sessionable
beer
drinkability
by
no
means
bad
just
not
outstanding
this
is
one
i
would
not
seek
out
but
i
would
gladly
drink
it
if
offered
easy
to
drink
several
with
only
4
4
abv
imo
mouthfeel
does
not
impress
to
me
it
seems
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
average
carbonation
good
drinkability
however
the
fairy
tasty
inoffensive
type
of
beer
you
could
easily
take
a
few
of
pours
a
nice
clear
darktea
brown
a
tan
head
soon
becomes
a
patchy
ring
smells
good
of
brown
sugar
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
nuttiness
like
a
good
piece
of
brittle
i
detect
more
of
the
chocolatey
richness
and
bitterness
from
the
first
sip
may
be
just
a
bit
thin
but
the
taste
is
filling
and
good
nice
dry
but
smooth
finish
easy
drinkability
im
bummed
this
one
was
retired
cheers
drinkabilty
after
having
smuttynose
and
samuel
smith
i
almost
want
to
call
this
a
light
beer
its
low
alcohol
mixed
with
it
being
so
mild
and
smooth
i
could
rip
though
a
6pack
in
no
time
would
drink
again
but
there
are
better
nut
browns
out
there
and
quite
the
contrary
not
retired
just
bought
it
with
new
label
its
back
from
the
dead
just
under
a
finger
of
beige
head
body
is
dark
brownmahogany
and
theres
a
tiny
bit
of
retention
and
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
aromas
are
chocolate
maltiness
dominating
but
not
explosive
by
any
means
acidity
discernible
in
the
aromas
as
well
flavors
are
definitely
chocolate
a
nice
tang
that
balances
out
but
the
emphasis
here
is
definitely
on
the
chocolate
biscuit
malt
just
what
id
expect
from
an
english
brown
mouthfeel
is
high
carbonation
seemingly
making
whatever
acidity
is
there
pop
out
lighter
body
all
in
all
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
taste
is
nutty
with
a
decent
roast
and
touch
of
chocolate
very
good
combination
of
malty
flavors
i
like
it
quite
drinkable
and
sessionable
to
boot
at
4
4
the
nut
flavors
are
very
prevalent
and
varied
peanuts
to
brazil
nuts
to
cashews
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
creamier
body
and
more
malt
presence
but
i
am
still
digging
it
one
of
the
better
nut
browns
i
have
had
notes
my
favorite
english
brown
ale
from
this
side
of
the
pond
i
could
see
picking
up
a
6
pack
of
this
if
i
came
across
it
it
isnt
the
best
nut
brown
ive
had
but
much
better
than
i
expected
notes
sure
enough
it
may
not
be
nothing
remarkable
but
it
is
a
decent
brown
ale
rather
quaffable
pity
to
see
it
discontinued
but
luckily
tröegs
will
keep
on
brewing
something
quality
to
replace
this
one
in
their
line
up
this
was
a
very
easy
drinker
with
good
flavor
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
thin
but
was
still
tasty
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
nicely
blended
simple
well
made
very
drinkable
enjoyable
d
a
nice
brown
ale
that
isnt
overly
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
overall
overall
the
beer
was
good
the
flavor
was
well
balanced
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
and
also
tasty
its
a
drinkable
beer
that
will
probably
appeal
to
most
beer
drinkers
id
call
it
a
light
brown
ale
so
ale
drinkers
will
enjoy
and
it
isnt
too
heavy
for
any
light
beer
drinkers
i
prefer
porters
and
stouts
but
i
also
enjoyed
this
one
for
a
lighter
brown
ale
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
cap
of
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
roasted
nuts
slight
carmley
sweetness
and
earthy
hops
taste
begins
as
somewhat
carmley
sweet
prgressing
quickly
into
the
roasted
nut
territory
finished
with
some
earthy
hopyness
medium
bodied
good
level
of
carbonation
a
good
brown
ale
poured
from
the
fresh
bottle
into
a
clean
pint
glass
brown
color
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
moderate
lacing
smell
was
english
and
reminded
me
of
other
nut
browns
roasty
toasty
and
delicious
i
liked
this
one
easy
to
drink
and
made
me
want
some
fishnchips
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
thanks
again
d
i
like
this
beer
not
very
jazzy
but
traditionally
made
english
style
simple
and
quaffable
very
nice
for
pairing
with
poultry
or
maybe
a
simple
meal
of
meatloaf
and
brown
rice
i
enjoyed
it
and
feel
it
fits
the
style
well
see
you
on
the
flipside
rugged
trail
notes
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
with
nice
layers
of
roasted
maltiness
with
hop
backing
rugged
trail
goes
down
really
easily
and
the
fairly
low
abv
makes
sure
you
dont
pay
for
it
rugged
trail
was
never
my
favorite
in
the
troegs
lineup
and
when
i
bought
sampler
cases
they
always
seemed
to
be
the
last
to
go
i
like
it
but
i
dont
think
i
will
miss
it
too
much
d
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brown
ale
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
am
a
bit
disappointed
that
it
was
retired
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
not
much
offwhite
tanish
colored
head
which
went
away
quickly
vague
malty
and
nutty
smell
but
was
much
more
present
in
the
taste
very
light
for
a
darker
style
beer
in
my
opinion
this
one
could
use
a
significant
boost
to
the
abv
pretty
good
beer
but
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
troegs
beers
ive
tried
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
some
nice
albeit
simple
flavors
and
a
relatively
low
abv
makes
this
beer
very
sessionable
a
tasty
beer
from
troegs
its
a
shame
its
being
retired
if
you
can
still
find
it
i
recommend
picking
some
up
overall
this
was
a
solid
offering
from
troegs
and
i
am
a
little
sad
to
see
it
go
give
this
a
try
before
it
is
all
gone
recommended
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
sessionable
beer
if
i
can
find
a
few
more
bottles
i
will
definitely
grab
them
another
keeper
from
troegs
though
i
am
disappointed
to
see
that
this
great
brown
ale
will
be
discontinued
dthis
is
a
decent
beer
it
doesnt
have
huge
flavor
but
what
it
does
have
works
very
well
and
offers
a
nice
array
of
tastes
d
its
a
drinkable
session
beer
probably
the
worst
offering
ive
had
from
troegs
which
is
saying
something
with
how
im
grading
this
i
can
see
why
they
discontinued
it
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
a
little
light
for
troegs
standards
tröegs
rugged

nut
brown

is
a
solid
dark
brown
ale
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
leaves
solid
sheets
of
lacing
on
the

it
has
a
slightly

very
drinkable
very
flavorful
for
such
a

d
seems
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
overall
i
found
this
slightly
lacking
in
depth
of
flavor
not
bad
though
if
i
want
to
throw
a
few
back
this
isnt
necessarily
the
hardest
thing
to
drink
but
it
is
a
pretty
standard
issue
brown
ale
and
i
presume
thats
why
troegs
decided
to
retire
it
overall
rugged
trail
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
the
aroma
and
taste
are
above
average
although
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lacking
the
low
abv
4
4
makes
this
an
outstanding
selection
for
a
session
beer
especially
in
the
colder
months
of
fall
winter
im
very
disappointed
that
this
has
been
retired
by
troegs
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
and
enjoyable
to
drink
decent
and
could
kick
back
a
few
for
sure
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
clear
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
goes
into
a
ring
with
pretty
good
lacing
light
malty
aroma
but
not
much
else
very
mild
in
taste
malty
with
a
slight
sour
note
and
a
clean
finish
overall
a
pleasant
experiance
the
mild
taste
and
low
avb
make
this
an
excellent
session
beer
too
bad
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
now
that
it
will
not
be
brewed
anymore
na
zdravje
taste
is
rather
lacking
slightly
nutty
flavor
goes
down
smooth
though
with
a
decent
drinkability
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
there
is
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
but
ive
had
it
for
a
number
of
months
so
it
may
be
past
its
prime
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
not
as
dark
as
dark
chocolate
but
close
to
that
there
was
a
modest
head
of
tan
bubbles
that
quickly
settled
to
something
thats
less
than
a
skim
of
foam
just
a
few
small
bubbles
and
a
little
foam
lacing
but
i
can
see
bare
spots
as
well
swirling
the
beer
around
gives
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
theres
a
little
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
maybe
some
raisin
and
some
warm
toasted
grain
all
of
the
aromas
are
very
slight
though
the
beer
has
some
sweet
malt
flavor
up
from
to
compliment
the
aroma
this
gives
way
to
a
nutty
biting
flavor
at
first
i
thought
it
was
an
off
taste
but
after
taking
a
few
more
sips
i
like
it
the
flavor
is
a
bit
watery
for
my
tastes
and
im
the
first
to
say
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
but
i
like
this
one
this
beer
has
a
light
body
but
it
is
also
complex
the
watery
flavor
makes
it
feel
light
at
first
but
the
robust
nuttiness
in
the
finish
gives
the
beer
some
punch
as
you
swallow
very
little
mouthcoating
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
can
be
found
if
you
go
looking
for
it
this
beer
drinks
very
easy
i
cant
think
of
any
real
objections
other
than
its
not
a
challenging
beer
the
rugged
trail
will
never
command
your
full
attention
but
would
be
great
to
drink
whilst
engaged
in
other
activities
troegs
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
while
this
beer
is
a
bit
tame
the
taste
is
great
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
date
809
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
lil
head
dark
brown
color
scents
of
roasted
nuts
coffee
and
cocoa
very
little
carbonation
very
smooth
creamy
mouth
feel
slight
nutty
flavor
along
with
a
slighty
bitter
chocolate
coffee
almost
mocha
taste
pretty
drinkable
i
just
wonder
if
this
bottle
is
a
little
flat
because
of
the
bottled
on
date
cheers
this
is
definitely
very
easy
to
drink
overall
it
is
decent
but
in
a
whole
different
class
from
say
alesmith
nautical
nut
brown
drinkability
pretty
good
in
my
opinion
not
the
of
its
kind
but
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
pours
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
basically
nonexistent
possibly
some
roasted
or
caramel
malt
as
it
warmed
you
got
some
maple
syrup
aroma
but
it
was
always
very
faint
the
flavor
is
also
not
very
strong
with
some
roastyness
and
nuttyness
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
watery
and
the
carbonation
is
low
i
have
liked
the
other
beers
from
troegs
and
maybe
this
was
a
bad
bottle
but
this
one
is
a
miss
for
me
nothing
jumps
out
at
you
but
thats
what
an
english
brown
is
and
this
is
a
good
one
beer
has
a
slight
roast
character
to
the
flavor
in
the
back
of
the
palate
no
bitterness
from
hops
that
i
can
detect
a
little
caramel
in
there
overall
the
beer
is
medium
body
and
roasty
overall
i
dont
see
myself
paying
1
99
for
this
beer
again
especially
when
i
can
get
a
samuel
smith
nut
brown
ale
thats
around
5
abv
and
tastes
way
smoother
for
2
50
the
flavor
is
similarly
shy
bread
and
brown
sugar
flavors
are
in
there
along
with
a
light
bitterness
but
the
flavors
are
all
too
restrained
this
beer
isnt
awful
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
the
flavors
are
clean
and
in
balance
i
just
wanted
a
bit
more
to
chew
on
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
less
than
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
and
little
lacing
in
an
american
pint
glass
smelled
of
nuts
caramel
a
little
cocoa
powder
and
a
little
roasted
malt
the
taste
was
more
intense
with
more
nuttiness
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
even
a
little
bit
of
coffee
flavor
surprisingly
the
body
was
light
and
decently
carbonated
but
at
least
this
made
for
an
easydrinking
session
brown
ale
d
the
body
helps
a
bit
here
but
this
is
not
the
most
impressive
brew
not
enough
character
and
not
enough
flavor
this
one
is
a
bit
too
mellow
for
my
tastes
ill
pass
on
it
next
time
drinkability
looks
like
a
stout
and
would
definitely
be
one
if
the
body
were
heavier
and
it
was
more
roasted
and
a
bit
dryer
not
bad
but
thre
are
much
better
representations
of
this
style
to
be
found
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
likes
very
light
nonoffensive
beers
but
it
is
not
for
me
unfortunately
d
really
tasty
and
drinkable
didnt
realize
that
the
abv
was
this
low
4
40
i
could
easily
have
two
or
three
of
these
another
great
troegs
offering
dr
goes
down
way
easy
i
could
do
more
than
one
if
i
had
it
on
hand
last
time
i
had
this
i
did
not
find
it
to
be
that
memorable
this
time
though
im
ready
to
go
out
and
get
a
full
sixer
of
it
good
stuff
d
goes
down
easy
nice
beer
overall
a
nice
brown
not
a
big
brown
fan
but
i
could
sip
on
these
if
they
were
available
here
d
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
into
nut
ales
if
you
are
not
into
that
kind
of
beer
might
present
some
problems
with
the
smelltaste
combo
pours
a
dark
brown
color
that
appears
to
be
very
clear
judging
from
the
edges
of
the
darkness
has
less
than
a
finger
of
tanned
head
without
much
retension
and
leaves
little
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
full
of
a
malty
sweetness
and
a
touch
reminescent
of
caramel
also
includes
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
backend
blended
with
the
sweetness
taste
is
full
of
grain
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
caramel
and
finishes
quite
crisp
minorly
bitter
in
the
finish
as
well
lingering
taste
of
grain
and
hops
with
only
a
trace
of
bitterness
light
to
medium
body
feels
a
little
watered
down
but
that
may
help
the
drinkability
as
well
this
one
isnt
that
heavy
at
all
and
is
easy
to
put
away
overall
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
from
troegs
but
i
still
found
it
enjoyable
overall
this
is
nothing
special
or
out
of
the
ordinary
but
its
still
a
decent
brown
that
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
a
very
impressive
pour
pours
dark
brown
with
glints
of
mahogany
edges
brown
carbonation
cascades
upward
from
the
midbody
to
the
top
where
it
settles
in
thick
craggy
tan
head
toasted
and
earthy
aromas
as
well
as
flavors
also
tastes
of
cocoa
nibs
a
relatively
simple
beer
for
the
style
but
enjoyable
an
english
brown
ale
from
one
of
the
premier
breweries
in
the
country
pours
dark
brown
with
a
firm
one
inch
of
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
mostly
chocolate
with
hints
of
nuts
has
a
nice
milk
chocolate
flavor
with
hints
of
roasted
nuts
has
a
semisweet
finish
with
is
sort
of
unique
the
body
is
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
but
i
suppose
that
is
the
price
to
pay
for
the
low
abv
i
would
be
harsher
if
it
had
a
higher
abv
and
this
sort
of
body
carbonation
is
good
without
being
harsh
very
sessionable
i
could
put
several
of
these
away
and
not
be
tired
of
the
beer
this
was
an
okay
drink
however
i
really
like
nutty
beers
and
this
certainly
wasnt
one
of
them
so
i
was
mildly
disappointed
in
that
aspect
but
other
than
that
it
was
a
fairly
okay
beer
overall
a
bit
flat
and
light
for
the
style
but
nothing
too
off
that
i
would
object
to
drinking
this
again
decent
brown
ale
a
bit
too
bright
on
my
tongue
for
my
liking
but
not
terrible
this
beer
would
be
an
easy
sessionable
beer
however
i
dont
think
ill
revisit
it
in
the
future
as
it
is
a
little
too
bland
in
my
opinion
i
would
enjoy
it
more
if
troegs
upped
the
alcohol
a
notch
and
inserted
more
flavor
dnothing
crazy
herea
solid
simple
and
tasty
quaffer
a
well
built
easy
to
drink
brew
the
perfect
kind
of
beer
to
use
an
introduction
to
craft
beer
overall
a
fine
beer
a
little
thin
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
i
would
drink
one
again
i
bought
this
bottle
at
rileys
in
madison
wi
its
funny
how
you
might
dislike
something
at
the
bar
but
get
home
and
think
about
it
review
it
even
and
like
it
more
with
its
under
5
abv
you
got
an
almost
session
beer
here
could
drink
it
all
day
weathers
a
bit
to
warm
for
this
to
be
drank
all
day
but
after
the
sun
goes
down
drinkability
is
good
troegs
nut
brown
has
a
good
balance
and
some
good
taste
without
overwhelming
but
not
great
enough
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
this
is
an
easy
drinker
very
smooth
and
medium
bodied
very
enjoyable
disappointing
as
troegs
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
d
not
very
drinkable
could
barely
finish
one
but
i
gotta
tell
you
there
just
wasnt
much
going
on
the
bottle
it
did
have
a
nice
rounded
taste
to
it
but
it
just
didnt
go
out
of
the
way
to
impress
glad
i
tried
it
more
than
once
as
i
bought
a
6er
but
i
wont
be
going
back
is
there
a
bad
troegs
beer
just
simply
an
amazing
session
brown
i
know
my
review
doesnt
say
much
but
its
just
so
simple
yet
perfect
this
is
what
a
all
session
browns
should
taste
like
i
guess
overall
i
would
rate
the
whole
package
as
slightly
below
average
d
completely
unaggressive
very
mellow
i
can
drink
this
cold
warm
whatever
its
rather
pleasant
but
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
in
fact
i
think
its
the
weakest
beer
from
troegs
the
smell
is
decent
but
he
flavor
fails
to
deliver
almost
watery
and
thin
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
pours
a
deep
nutty
brown
color
obviously
inviting
aromas
of
caramel
some
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
the
taste
follows
with
some
definite
roasted
notes
and
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
not
awful
easy
drinking
for
sure
ive
had
3
different
troegs
beers
over
the
last
3
nights
and
have
enjoyed
each
of
them
great
brewery
recommended
pours
from
a
bottle
pours
a
nauseating
chestnut
with
absolutely
zero
head
the
faintest
hint
of
lacing
stunning
herbal
aroma
accompanied
by
sweat
and
citrus
thick
smoky
taste
with
orange
and
mango
nondescript
mouthfeel
and
slightly
dry
finish
finger
plus
head
of
light
brown
foam
mainly
larger
bubbles
fairly
full
coating
of
lacing
stays
around
for
some
time
you
get
more
cocoa
and
mocha
dust
in
the
nose
than
outandout
nuttiness
kinda
roasted
citrus
peel
notes
too
not
much
obvious
hoppy
presence
smooth
and
borderline
silky
nostril
texture
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
rises
above
the
level
of
prodding
forward
instead
kind
of
disperses
the
flavors
malt
milk
chocolate
creamed
coffee
and
then
brazil
nut
walnut
flavors
has
a
mineral
water
type
of
freshness
that
more
or
less
cancels
out
the
underlying
roasted
notes
the
lemon
and
orange
citrus
has
a
tenuous
presence
but
there
any
fruit
muted
and
woven
into
the
overall
fabric
the
hops
as
well
indistinct

0
d
decent
im
not
pissed
that
i
drank
it
but
id
rather
i
not
have
it
too
often
definately
a
beer
you
can
sit
down
with
and
craack
a
few
not
hard
to
swallow
by
any
means
reddish
brown
in
color
little
to
no
head
it
is
appealing
to
the
eye
nutty
nose
with
hints
of
malt
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
nice
and
creamy
and
has
a
good
malt
presence
the
nut
is
more
understated
than
most
nut
browns
which
i
like
the
attack
is
clean
and
the
finish
is
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
lush
and
thick
looking
at
my
notes
i
hope
that
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
get
a
free
bonus
from
being
on
the
same
list
as
some
other
less
impressive
brews
i
think
i
was
fair
though
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
this
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
nut
browns
i
wonder
if
my
numbers
will
bear
that
out
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
dark
almost
coffee
like
color
with
reddish
hues
smells
of
caramel
and
chocolate
tastes
somewhat
bitter
with
caramel
finish
creamy
in
the
mouth
kind
of
heavy
on
the
stomach
so
drinkability
is
not
so
great
maybe
nut
brown
ales
are
not
for
me
the
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
the
pint
glass
to
yeild
a
very
dark
brown
color
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
and
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
as
was
taste
which
was
sweet
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
beer
is
ok
but
needs
some
more
body
d
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
if
i
had
better
access
to
it
id
definitely
drink
more
of
it
this
was
my
first
troegs
beer
and
i
was
far
from
disappointed
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
reddish
brown
and
was
mostly
translucent
head
started
off
as
a
nice
2
finger
mocha
brown
head
that
lasted
a
few
minutes
then
clung
to
the
side
smell
was
a
sweet
nutty
brown
multi
grain
bread
taste
was
brown
sugar
and
wheat
felt
very
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
detracted
from
an
otherwise
solid
beer
very
easy
to
drink
pleasant
to
do
so
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
wet
some
mild
carbonation
on
the
tongue
flavor
of
molasses
sweet
breads
and
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
not
bad
another
good
product
from
this
brewery
the
low
abv
and
refreshing
taste
make
this
dark
brew
a
quaffer
even
for
the
hot
summer
light
to
medium
body
overall
smooth
but
moments
of
both
wateriness
and
acidic
texture
moderate
but
sometimes
fizzy
and
prickly
carbonation
there
was
not
much
to
this
beer
it
was
brown
ale
to
definition
nothing
extraordinary
easy
drinking
brown
ale
the
smell
and
taste
are
dominated
by
something
roasted
until
burnt
such
as
seeds
or
nuts
the
finish
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
but
again
roasted
dark
not
sweet
chocolate
this
does
not
have
the
sweetness
of
many
other
brown
ales
the
feel
is
smooth
if
unremarkable
which
along
with
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
tröegs
rugged
trail
nut
brown
ale
very
drinkable
overall
a
prety
good
nut
brown
ale
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
would
have
hoped
for
but
drinkable
notes
disappointed
with
this
one
there
are
better
brown
ales
out
there
just
was
flat
and
onedimensional
drinkability
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
very
much
it
seemed
pretty
plain
i
do
prefer
more
hop
orientated
beer
but
i
think
if
this
had
more
nut
flavor
or
really
just
something
exciting
in
the
taste
i
would
like
it
a
great
deal
more
it
seems
to
sticky
to
even
be
a
good
session
beer
d
very
good
session
beer
at
4
4
tastes
like
several
of
my
homebrew
attempts
with
a
heavy
maltlight
hops
mix
would
try
again
hopefully
on
tap
this
is
overall
extremely
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
at
4
4
abv
its
an
excellent
session
beer
quite
thin
almost
like
water
light
chocolate
malt
with
a
mild
hop
kicker
a
little
onedimensional
easy
to
drink
but
not
fascinating
as
far
as
troegs
lineup
is
concerned
i
dont
think
theres
a
stinker
in
the
bunch
if
there
had
to
be
id
nominate
rugged
trail
sure
its
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
but
with
so
many
better
offerings
from
this
brewery
why
would
you
if
youre
looking
for
somewhere
to
start
with
this
brewerys
diverse
and
delicious
lineup
look
elsewhere
thanks
drjay
d
exceptional
drinkability
4
40
abv
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
its
refreshing
yet
earthy
and
has
some
substance
to
it
i
think
i
have
found
my
favorite
from
troegsvery
low
abv
but
the
taste
is
simply
awesome
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
a
few
more
things
here
and
there
and
it
could
be
a
great
thing
on
tap
at
elmer
sudds
arrived
in
a
pint
glass
and
appears
a
slightly
hazed
dark
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
light
tan
foam
taste
and
nose
are
of
lightly
caramelized
malts
nuts
such
as
pecans
and
hazelnuts
cocoa
powder
very
mild
coffee
a
bit
watery
with
medium
carbonation
not
too
shabby
ill
seek
this
one
out
from
time
to
time
this
trail
is
rather
smooth
and
unrugged
hate
to
say
i
ever
drain
poured
a
troegs
but
i
just
did
this
kills
the
variety
pack
for
me
d
if
you
want
a
light
bodied
sweet
beer
with
a
low
abv
that
you
can
drink
like
cokeacola
then
look
no
further
this
troegs
for
you
if
you
want
a
rich
dark
roasty
nutty
english
brown
ale
well
try
someplace
else
this
is
about
as
obvious
as
a
session
beer
gets
4
40
abv
and
i
cant
even
feel
a
drop
of
it
sure
this
went
down
easily
but
i
prefer
my
beers
to
have
some
depth
to
them
so
i
can
sip
and
savor
them
this
is
so
light
that
it
almost
feels
like
its
carbonated
but
ya
wont
notice
that
would
involve
too
much
thought
and
this
is
just
a
typical
example
of
an
easygoing
style
drinkability
is
what
this
one
has
going
for
it
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
and
has
a
low
abv
which
makes
it
a
decent
example
of
a
session
beer
i
think
this
is
a
typical
brown
ale
good
flavor
and
easy
drinking
i
like
a
few
local
browns
better
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
pours
nice
brown
color
very
good
coloring
looks
like
a
good
quality
nut
brown
color
the
smell
has
a
slight
malt
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
a
little
weak
for
a
nut
brown
it
doesnt
have
to
deep
rich
taste
that
other
nut
browns
offer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
there
is
no
carbination
to
be
felt
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
beer
d
id
drink
alot
of
this
no
problem
low
alcohol
tasty
a
little
residual
nut
bitterness
does
build
up
over
drinking
it
like
eating
too
many
walnuts
d
very
drinkable
not
overly
sweet
or
roasty
or
thick
a
good
session
brown
d
more
sessionable
than
most
brown
ales
but
i
dont
know
if
thats
a
good
thing
in
this
caseprobably
the
least
impressive
brew
ive
had
from
troegs
brew
poured
to
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
copper
highlights
good
sized
offwhite
head
that
has
fair
retention
but
does
leave
some
lacing
tasted
malt
aroma
is
very
nice
and
seems
to
leads
to
a
slight
nuttiness
the
aroma
also
seems
to
have
a
very
subtle
chocolatecocoa
property
the
flavor
is
where
this
beer
shines
for
me
the
roasted
malts
mixed
with
a
slight
chocolate
property
really
mix
quite
perfectly
their
is
a
slight
hop
presence
at
the
tail
end
but
is
more
of
an
accompaniment
than
anything
else
has
a
slightly
different
finishing
taste
that
i
like
but
suppose
could
be
a
deterrent
for
others
this
brew
is
very
smooth
in
its
feel
extremely
drinkable
perfect
session
beer
i
am
so
impressed
with
this
brewery
thankful
we
are
seeing
their
stuff
in
ny
now
a
little
different
taste
than
the
english
beers
i
have
had
easy
beer
to
drink
would
make
a
good
session
beer
overall
i
probably
got
a
strange
bottle
i
got
straightup
marinara
sauce
out
of
this
seriously
otherwise
great
sessionability
but
low
flavor
makes
this
one
a
pass
pours
a
dark
brown
color
little
to
no
head
very
small
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
very
nutty
and
has
some
nice
roasted
aromas
to
it
taste
is
mildly
light
bodied
okay
mouthfeel
the
usual
brown
ale
nuttiness
to
it
suffers
from
a
lack
of
carbonation
very
flat
doesnt
make
the
beer
all
too
appealing
a
decent
beer
clearly
the
lowlight
of
the
mixed
12
but
it
seems
like
every
brewery
feels
obligated
to
make
a
brown
ale
ill
drink
it
but
id
rather
have
any
other
beer
from
this
brewery
d
an
easy
drinker
at
4
4
i
could
drink
a
6er
no
problem
in
a
sitting
the
flavor
profile
is
just
enough
to
keep
you
interested
while
not
being
overbearing
this
one
is
somewhat
on
the
mild
side
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
brown
ale
but
not
close
to
as
aromatic
or
flavorful
as
many
browns
out
there
rereview
may
2009
there
is
a
tad
bit
more
body
to
the
beer
than
i
initially
gave
it
credit
for
there
is
more
drying
notes
in
the
finish
and
a
creamy
smoothness
and
some
walnut
like
notes
in
the
finish
it
isnt
a
particularly
sweet
beer
but
it
is
refreshing
im
adding
some
points
drinkability
is
quite
nice
and
makes
this
one
a
geed
session
ale
drinkability
i
like
my
nut
beers
to
have
a
good
nut
taste
to
it
and
this
fits
the
bill
very
smooth
and
sessionable
i
like
the
multiple
layers
to
this
beer
and
it
stands
out
among
nut
flavored
beers
dare
i
say
this
may
be
the
best
nut
brown
i
have
had
d
very
easy
to
drink
very
low
abv
like
a
more
refined
new
castle
not
a
great
pour
my
bad
very
dark
ruby
red
almost
purple
ok
head
toasty
with
molasses
and
coffee
in
the
nose
not
especially
nutty
in
aroma
some
fruit
some
toast
and
light
hoppiness
in
the
flavour
kind
of
allaround
mild
flavours
a
bit
astringent
with
a
medium
carbonation
and
body
is
drinkable
not
particularly
exciting
but
no
off
flavours
either
solid
sessionable
brown
ale
notes
not
a
whole
lot
to
talk
about
better
than
a
newcastle
abv
is
not
issue
at
all
the
calories
from
the
sweetness
may
be
a
bit
limiting
2
of
4
in
my
troegs
sampler
12
pack
has
a
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
but
it
goes
down
extremely
easy
carbonation
is
low
but
again
it
goes
handinhand
with
this
being
a
pretty
good
not
great
session
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
some
red
undertones
looks
like
cocacola
very
little
head
that
disapates
to
nothing
nice
smell
of
malts
and
some
chocolate
hazelnut
flavor
mixed
with
some
malts
and
with
some
underlying
hops
some
chocolate
aftertaste
there
is
some
carbonation
and
it
has
a
thin
on
body
very
drinkable
and
tasty
good
seesion
beer
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
worth
a
try
i
wish
i
had
more
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
very
light
low
in
abv
and
well
balanced
it
makes
a
pretty
good
session
beer
as
well
as
a
good
beer
for
its
smoothness
d
pretty
easy
and
palatable
english
brown
nice
balance
not
a
knock
out
but
sessionable
nonetheless
this
is
a
very
nice
drinkable
session
beer
there
could
be
a
little
more
malt
body
to
balance
out
the
hop
bitterness
for
my
taste
but
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
it
isnt
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
up
that
carbonation
and
you
have
a
winner
but
until
then
i
probably
would
skip
this
one
pours
an
almost
black
body
with
minor
white
head
that
receeds
quickly
a
roasted
malt
smell
along
with
toffee
and
some
minor
sweet
malts
in
the
aroma
with
very
little
hops
present
a
thicker
fullbody
beer
that
contains
moderate
sweetness
and
hints
of
oak
and
nuts
for
a
decent
drying
backbite
while
a
tad
simple
a
solid
brown
and
perfect
to
session
a
few
while
chillin
at
the
bar
pours
a
great
dark
brown
with
some
good
garnet
flashes
with
a
nice
head
and
some
decent
lacing
nice
deep
scent
very
malty
although
not
much
else
i
loved
the
taste
deep
and
dark
malty
with
some
nice
hop
undertones
and
dry
as
well
wouldve
been
rated
a
bit
higher
but
there
is
almost
pretty
much
no
nuttiness
to
it
which
isnt
a
big
deal
except
its
in
the
name
good
thick
after
taste
too
goes
down
fine
with
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
excellent
brown
ale
d
a
decent
nut
brown
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
many
of
these
4
4
abv
makes
this
very
easy
hoping
to
finish
this
review
up
and
have
a
nice
refreshing
can
of
shlitz
beer
in
celebration
of
a
wake
forest
victory
d
had
2
pints
but
the
selection
that
night
was
not
the
best
had
on
tap
at
coles
in
buffalo
poured
a
dark
walnut
with
a
bit
of
red
around
the
edges
very
small
head
with
not
much
lacing
smelled
malty
with
hint
of
molasses
taste
was
nice
but
nothing
exceptional
with
mostly
malt
coming
through
with
hint
of
chocolate
it
was
moderate
carbonation
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
overall
a
nice
beer
that
you
could
have
a
few
and
have
a
nice
evening
drinkability
easy
drinking
as
a
nut
brown
should
be
just
a
boring
example
i
wouldnt
look
forward
to
a
second
bottle
ever
rugged
trail
was
a
darker
than
i
expected
almost
the
color
of
a
porter
or
stout
dark
mahogany
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
had
some
nuttiness
to
it
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
both
pleasant
enough
but
were
a
little
too
reminiscent
of
cola
for
my
taste
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
probably
would
not
seek
it
out
dark
brown
with
a
little
lacing
and
a
thin
island
of
head
remains
on
the
beer
after
pouring
aroma
is
a
little
different
with
the
roasted
grains
coming
in
very
clean
and
notpungent
at
all
a
little
floral
and
sweet
i
enjoyed
it
taste
starts
out
all
right
just
the
beginning
tastes
like
a
really
nice
brown
ale
or
porter
with
all
the
nice
roastyness
involved
but
it
soon
diminishes
to
just
plain
wateryness
i
was
excited
to
see
troegs
initially
when
it
first
started
getting
distributed
here
but
all
their
beers
seems
like
watery
beer
soda
save
the
time
i
had
hopback
on
tap
which
i
thought
was
great
this
was
the
last
bottle
i
bought
from
them
and
while
i
dont
find
them
all
out
bad
i
do
not
think
theyre
particularly
good
a
huge
boost
in
the
flavor
and
getting
rid
of
the
sodalike
quality
of
their
brews
would
be
a
huge
step
up
for
me
troegs
nut
brown
is
a
welcome
departure
from
traditional
english
brown
ales
as
it
has
more
flavorful
with
a
bigger
variety
of
flavors
while
still
maintaing
a
brown
ale
balance
one
of
my
favorite
browns
to
date
just
a
pretty
good
beer
over
all

d
not
an
amazing
example
of
the
style
but
definitely
drinkable
thanks
sean
for
this
overall
well
balanced
and
a
good
session
beer
due
to
its
low
alcohol
i
wouldnt
get
bored
with
this
one
d
great
example
of
a
brown
ale
very
drinkable
man
this
is
a
beer
thats
two
steps
away
from
exceptional
just
needs
a
bit
more
in
regards
to
body
that
being
said
its
still
a
damned
fine
ale
and
one
i
could
drink
regularly
due
to
the
low
abv
the
feel
is
milky
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
velvety
top
notch
its
really
one
of
the
better
browns
i
have
had
its
bitter
and
sweet
as
well
loaded
with
caramel
and
hints
of
chocolate
just
great
poured
into
the
samuel
adams
pint
glass
deep
brown
in
color
dishwater
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
soapy
ring
aroma
is
dry
with
chocolate
coffee
hops
and
all
purpose
ale
yeast
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
it
is
a
bit
lackluster
sweet
and
toasted
a
little
thin
and
a
mellow
hopping
residual
spiciness
is
slightly
unfavorable
maybe
the
hops
are
a
little
aggressive
or
the
toasted
grain
is
more
burnt
than
toasted
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
isnt
the
best
english
brown
i
have
come
across
decent
though
d
very
tasty
for
how
small
a
beer
it
is
highly
sessionable
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brownish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
caramel
and
a
bit
nutty
in
the
taste
small
watery
caramel
malt
and
a
dry
nuttiness
in
the
end
a
smooth
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
very
small
dry
nuttiness
in
the
aftertaste
ok
light
body
and
flavor
but
nice
d
sessionable
nothing
to
distinctive
or
memorable
but
nothing
detracting
either
a
very
average
brew
all
the
way
around
pours
very
thick
and
dark
looks
more
like
a
nut
black
than
a
nut
brown
virtually
no
head
and
little
carbonation
its
almost
nonexistent
aroma
is
of
sweet
biscuity
malts
the
taste
is
alright
they
definitely
went
light
on
the
malts
and
hops
its
kinda
sweet
and
not
too
nutty
it
has
a
very
light
body
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
its
a
good
session
beer
if
youre
into
that
kinda
thing
d
this
has
a
nice
roastednutty
taste
and
with
its
low
abv
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
could
drink
many
of
these
drinkability
not
a
terribly
impressive
beer
but
definitely
a
drinkable
one
a
decent
toasty
malt
profile
a
sub5
0
abv
and
nothing
too
offensive
makes
this
a
drinkable
if
not
impressive
beer
this
was
the
first
ive
heard
of
this
brewery
and
so
far
im
fairly
impressed
i
consider
this
a
very
good
english
nut
brown
and
definitely
worth
buying
again
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
forming
a
1
head
over
a
dark
walnut
colored
body
the
head
faded
pretty
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
very
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
nutlike
not
at
all
fruity
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
toasted
caramel
the
flavor
upfront
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
with
some
bread
or
biscuit
thrown
in
theres
a
very
light
hops
presence
at
the
back
earthy
nutty
and
very
well
matched
to
the
brew
it
feels
very
full
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
slight
dry
finish
this
is
the
best
of
the
four
in
their
variety
pack
imo
and
it
deserves
a
very
mark
in
drinkability
wiedersehen
not
bad
but
not
impressive
i
found
this
to
be
a
belowaverage
nut
brown
i
like
the
thickness
of
it
but
something
in
the
finish
left
me
lacking
almost
reminds
me
of
a
watereddown
hazelnut
brown
average
in
just
about
every
way
which
is
a
shame
because
of
my
love
for
the
troegs
brewery
d
very
low
abv
makes
this
beer
very
sessionable
however
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
by
troegs
much
prefer
this
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
tap
gives
more
hop
flavor
great
session
beer
and
one
i
will
seek
out
again
and
again
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
brew
smells
of
dark
chocalate
the
taste
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
is
chocolate
malty
goodness
and
ends
with
a
very
plesant
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
body
with
little
carbonation
rugged
trail
goes
down
smooth
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
marron
with
a
toffee
colored
head
nice
hazelnut
aroma
with
hints
of
bready
malt
and
hop
undertones
a
nice
hop
bitterness
upfront
developing
into
a
nutty
malty
finish
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
its
easy
to
put
away
a
case
in
an
evening
with
friends
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
could
session
while
hanging
out
and
playing
darts
this
is
worth
trying
sometime
dsimply
put
outstanding
as
i
said
before
well
rounded
and
also
eminently
drinkable
another
winner
from
troegs
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
if
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looked
and
smelled
it
would
be
a
phenomenal
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
though
drinkability
is
moderate
flavor
is
not
too
impressive
but
the
low
alcohol
makes
for
a
sessionable
brew
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
an
inch
an
a
half
frothy
tan
head
after
a
vigorous
pour
head
retention
is
average
but
the
lacing
is
pretty
good
it
smells
like
nuts
chocolate
toasted
malt
and
caramel
aroma
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
bit
weak
it
tastes
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
cherries
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
it
seems
thin
to
me
its
also
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
and
its
smooth
and
sessionable
its
a
decent
beer
but
its
not
something
i
would
buy
all
the
time
but
if
you
get
the
chance
you
should
try
it
its
not
bad
low
alcohol
makes
this
an
easily
sessionable
beer
not
too
bitter
or
sweet
dvery
dirnkable
browneasy
paring
with
food
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
drink
again
when
the
mood
for
a
brown
strikes
me
d
this
is
an
average
brown
ale
well
crafted
but
nothing
really
noteworthy
goes
down
very
easy
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
deep
translucent
brown
with
red
highlights
around
the
edges
quarter
inch
head
dissipated
almost
instantaneously
into
a
thin
inconsistent
skim
of
foam
that
coalesced
around
the
edges
scent
was
malty
sweet
with
a
pronounced
caramel
presence
and
a
slight
nutty
character
in
the
background
taste
consistent
with
nose
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
are
very
much
in
the
foreground
mouthfeel
was
light
to
mediumbodied
with
a
mild
tingle
across
the
tongue
very
sessionable
brown
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
however
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
could
be
a
bit
cloying
after
more
than
a
couple
smooth
and
easy
going
down
is
this
what
they
mean
by
a
session
beer
this
is
the
first
brown
ale
i
have
tried
being
so
i
think
i
expected
something
a
little
more
from
this
beer
overall
i
think
i
would
drink
this
again
but
after
i
tried
a
few
others
first
overall
a
very
average
brown
ale
if
they
improve
the
feel
it
would
be
much
better
d
not
a
big
nut
brown
fan
but
this
is
good
the
strong
chocolate
flavor
and
coffee
smell
make
the
beer
come
off
a
little
heavy
d
a
light
and
easy
drinking
brown
which
would
make
for
a
good
session
along
with
its
fairly
low
abv
of
4
2
didnt
really
impress
me
flavor
wise
but
the
drinkability
made
up
for
it
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
short
lived
tan
head
sweet
nutty
malt
taste
with
roasty
nutty
charred
like
malt
but
lightly
so
medium
to
full
bodied
with
some
coffee
flavors
complementing
the
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
average
to
light
carbonation
and
nicely
flavorful
on
the
whole
good
brown
ale
thanks
to
tbn2
for
trading
this
brew
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
dark
brown
colored
ale
with
a
quickly
fading
head
aroma
is
nutty
taste
is
chocolatenuts
and
slightly
metallic
this
is
not
bad
by
any
means
but
ive
drank
and
reviewed
better
brown
ales
i
would
drink
again
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
kind
of
unremarkable
overall
not
very
exciting
but
its
an
easy
drinking
ale
thats
subtleties
are
an
obvious
result
of
a
well
crafted
brew
great
session
beer
definitely
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
brownish
head
and
great
lacing
not
overpowering
in
either
the
malt
or
hops
department
but
just
the
right
amount
of
roasted
malts
and
sweetness
from
start
to
finish
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
i
could
drink
a
case
of
these
without
even
thinking
about
it
and
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
best
american
versions
of
this
style
out
there
ive
never
been
let
down
by
the
troegs
brothers
and
this
is
no
exception
definitely
in
my
top
3
every
day
casual
drinking
beers
if
for
no
other
reason
than
its
smoothness
and
drinkability
looks
like
an
extremely
dark
malty
brew
but
your
first
sip
reveals
a
smooth
light
nutty
beer
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
on
the
finish
and
a
slight
sweetness
throughout
let
me
emphasize
how
smoothly
this
beer
goes
down
on
my
first
bottle
i
took
a
sip
swallowed
thought
wow
this
is
good
immediately
took
another
sip
and
repeated
down
to
23rds
through
the
bottle
before
i
caught
myself
even
if
you
dont
normally
care
for
darker
beers
give
this
one
a
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
drinkability
decent
english
brown
and
quite
easy
to
drink
nothing
spectacular
but
good
looks
dark
redish
black
with
small
quickly
dispersing
head
smells
like
nutty
roasted
maltswith
chocolate
overtones
and
some
light
hops
tastes
pretty
much
like
the
smell
advertized
with
a
lighter
than
you
think
mouth
feel
that
makes
this
beer
very
drinkabel
these
sre
being
enjoyed
immensely
there
is
much
more
for
this
style
available
give
this
beer
a
try
poured
blackbrown
with
a
small
dark
head
that
fizzled
down
the
lace
that
blanketed
the
top
of
the
beer
looks
almost
more
like
a
stout
the
smell
was
nutty
malty
with
a
slight
hoppy
sting
but
not
very
strong
the
taste
was
dominated
by
roasted
malts
including
chocolate
malts
then
there
of
course
was
the
nuts
but
not
as
nutty
as
i
would
have
expected
or
would
have
liked
the
smallest
hint
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
like
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
was
lighter
than
the
appearance
suggested
and
it
was
well
carbonated
the
taste
was
fine
and
all
good
enough
to
give
it
a
shot
but
not
my
favorite
example
of
this
style
my
adult
kids
were
up
for
mothers
day
and
while
i
was
busy
bbqing
they
decided
to
raid
dads
beer
fridge
unfortunately
one
of
them
complained
that
there
was
no
brown
ale
to
be
had
her
favorite
so
i
apologized
and
decided
id
go
find
something
good
to
try
this
one
was
right
there
in
the
cooler
at
tdl
so
i
bought
it
tried
it
i
really
liked
it
deep
dark
brown
color
in
the
glass
and
a
rich
malty
smell
taste
of
dark
caramel
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
for
balance
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
expected
pleasant
surprise
and
extremely
drinkable
went
down
waaaay
too
smoothly
im
not
an
english
brown
fanatic
but
i
like
this
beer
ill
give
it
a
try
again
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
orange
highlights
tan
head
aroma
was
of
toffee
brown
sugar
nuts
and
a
hint
of
cola
relatively
light
body
and
delicately
sweet
with
a
nutty
note
i
also
tasted
some
nice
subdued
flowery
hop
surprisingly
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
d
a
good
session
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
a
brown
ale
english
or
american
d
probably
very
drinkable
if
its
flowing
on
tap
or
the
offering
of
the
night
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
would
certainly
never
turn
it
down
d
easy
toput
down
and
this
would
make
a
good
winter
beer
to
sit
down
with
for
a
night
nothing
too
special
though
mfd
thin
bodied
and
well
carbonated
felt
more
like
a
thin
smokey
porter
than
a
nut
brown
either
way
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
definitely
one
i
would
session
troegs
is
4
for
4
in
my
book
d
fell
quickly
definitely
worth
a
try
but
its
not
really
special
in
any
way
as
opposed
to
the
girl
who
recommended
it
drinkability
a
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
it
beer
light
and
easy
drinking
mfd
slightly
watery
and
highly
carbonated
i
guess
you
could
session
this
one
but
i
dont
think
id
bother
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
below
average
khaki
colored
head
that
left
a
light
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
light
roasted
malt
kind
of
like
weak
watery
coffee
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
chestnuts
pretty
one
sided
towards
the
malt
no
hop
flavor
or
aroma
detected
the
feel
is
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
well
balanced
it
is
a
finely
contructed
brew
but
nothing
is
spectacular
about
it
it
is
refreshing
and
at
4
4abv
you
can
make
a
night
out
of
drinking
these
this
is
a
deeply
brown
beer
bordering
on
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
subdued
but
contains
a
notable
roasted
malt
character
theres
a
little
floral
hop
smell
in
the
distance
of
the
aroma
and
also
a
little
unconverted
roasted
grain
the
taste
is
moderately
dry
with
the
roasted
grain
character
continuing
the
malt
flavor
becomes
more
restrained
through
the
drink
medium
in
body
and
a
little
rough
in
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
moderate
decent
bitterness
that
lasts
long
into
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
well
constructed
and
quite
well
balanced
all
in
all
this
is
a
fine
brew
i
dunno
theres
not
much
to
get
excited
about
here
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
but
even
for
the
style
its
lacking
troegs
brews
much
better
beers
than
this
rugged
trail
is
probably
only
for
the
insane
brown
ale
connoisseur
who
has
to
try
them
all
im
going
to
breeze
through
the
rest
of
this
bottle
and
finally
get
to
my
first
bigfoot
of
the
2008
season
a
nice
sessionable
english
brown
from
troegs
the
more
of
it
i
taste
the
more
i
like
it
m
d
this
one
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
feeling
carbonation
is
maybe
just
a
little
lower
than
what
id
expect
from
the
style
as
well
a
little
bit
lacking
all
around
it
would
be
easier
to
drink
if
the
tangy
and
metallic
notes
werent
so
noticable
i
found
the
doppelbock
to
be
rather
mediocre
as
well
so
it
is
starting
to
seem
like
hoppy
beers
are
where
the
tröeg
bros
shine
overall
not
that
big
of
a
fan
of
this
one
what
is
there
is
nice
but
there
just
aint
enough
of
it
a
bit
too
light
overall
pretty
drinkable
but
not
really
that
fantastic
aroma
and
flavor
were
a
little
weaker
than
i
was
looking
for
good
session
beer
but
not
very
interesting
d
good
for
session
light
for
a
brown
low
alcohol
and
flavors
went
great
with
mexican
not
troegs
best
but
not
bad
very
quaffable
even
with
a
couple
minor
flaws
a
great
session
beer
id
recommend
trying
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
that
shows
some
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
aroma
was
some
brown
malts
but
overall
rather
weak
the
taste
is
a
subdued
blend
of
brown
malts
and
a
mild
nuttiness
the
beer
is
very
light
bodied
and
quite
smooth
in
all
honesty
this
is
a
decent
example
of
a
style
im
not
all
that
fond
of
blufthis
is
definitely
a
good
session
ale
to
have
its
not
something
that
ill
search
out
but
its
good
for
any
night
of
the
week
average
representation
of
the
style
d
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
enough
ill
definitely
get
this
again
very
clear
dark
auburn
with
deep
red
highlights
a
half
inch
cap
of
slightly
rocky
beige
foam
appeared
after
the
pour
settling
into
a
ring
and
skim
of
fine
bubbles
just
a
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
was
nice
and
malty
chocolate
and
dark
kilned
malts
with
some
spicy
hops
thrown
in
quite
appealing
the
flavour
was
weighted
towards
malt
with
a
mild
caramel
and
chocolate
base
toasty
and
nutty
plus
a
delicate
roast
character
that
added
complexity
in
the
background
bitterness
was
restrained
yet
balanced
the
malt
and
spicy
hops
became
a
player
in
the
finish
along
with
lingering
bitter
cocoa
mediumlight
bodied
with
average
carbonation
decent
texture
overall
but
seems
just
a
little
thin
this
actually
helps
make
it
very
drinkable
and
highly
sessionable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
gladly
keep
some
on
hand
in
the
fridge
drinkability
for
some
reason
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
beer
in
the
beginning
that
all
changed
when
i
started
drinking
it
overall
it
was
a
well
rounded
nut
brown
ale
and
it
would
make
a
fine
session
nut
brown
ale
d
high
drinkability
not
a
remarkable
beer
but
like
all
the
troegs
ive
had
so
far
wonderfully
balanced
which
makes
them
very
worth
trying
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
nice
beer
with
a
lot
of
substance
that
wont
knock
you
over
thus
its
your
quintessential
session
beer
second
review
26
june
2008
i
have
revised
my
scores
up
slightly
i
am
not
sure
why
it
seemed
so
thin
last
time
i
had
it
it
seemed
a
very
pleasant
mediumlight
body
this
time
with
very
nice
flavors
like
milk
chocolate
and
whipped
cream
but
with
a
little
coffee
or
cinnamon
added
to
give
it
a
little
bitter
bite
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
an
extremely
enjoyable
mellow
beer
definitely
a
good
choice
for
anyone
wanting
an
english
brown
ale
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
some
of
the
deep
flavors
traditionally
found
in
this
style
moreys
bottom
line
im
a
fan
of
brown
ales
and
this
one
just
dosent
do
it
for
me
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
offering
from
the
troegs
brothers
to
date
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
tan
head
that
has
some
staying
power
nose
is
not
very
there
seems
mild
and
almost
dirty
very
mild
nut
quality
to
it
flavor
is
oh
my
goodness
damn
gina
such
subtle
qualities
to
it
it
doesnt
yell
and
scream
in
your
face
but
hits
you
with
multiple
layers
of
things
to
ponder
i
even
get
a
small
amount
of
raisins
here
beyond
that
the
nice
earthy
and
woody
stuff
minor
caramel
mixed
with
almost
a
woodbark
flavor
amazing
levels
of
flavor
here
but
you
really
have
to
be
ready
to
seek
them
out
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
level
of
liquid
feel
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
ebas
i
have
had
in
so
long
more
of
a
beer
to
ponder
than
just
down
i
like
d
a
nice
if
not
unremarkable
brown
ale
the
hints
of
chocolate
set
it
apart
from
others
pours
a
nice
bronze
color
with
slightly
offwhite
head
head
dissipates
really
quickly
aroma
is
not
real
prominent
but
has
somewhat
of
a
malty
character
taste
is
a
little
bland
but
the
beer
is
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
nothing
spectacular
but
very
drinkable
mild
pretty
typical
for
style
pretty
good
beer
as
a
brown
ale
is
smell
is
pretty
tame
subtle
if
you
are
being
optimistic
what
is
there
is
earthy
and
nutty
taste
is
somewhat
flat
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
i
really
did
not
like
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
carbonation
is
pretty
good
maybe
a
bit
high
overall
an
okay
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
return
to
auburn
chestnut
in
color
with
a
tan
head
an
light
lacing
smells
dominated
by
nuts
mostly
as
the
name
suggests
and
molasses
and
roasted
malt
for
taste
see
smell
mouthfeel
was
average
if
not
a
little
watery
not
bad
but
a
little
more
viscosity
would
do
nicely
good
drinkability
especially
this
time
of
year
a
nice
camp
fire
would
do
well
with
this
definitely
worth
a
try
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
fizzles
to
very
little
quickly
an
average
bit
of
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
good
a
strong
4
0
but
i
went
with
the
4
5
i
smell
coffee
molasses
and
toffee
sweetness
the
flavor
loses
a
little
adding
a
sort
of
grassy
bite
along
with
some
smoke
and
more
coffee
its
pretty
thin
stuff
a
bit
too
thin
to
me
with
lots
of
tingly
carbonation
to
liven
it
up
i
note
a
little
roasted
nuts
in
the
finish
not
bad
at
all
most
folks
should
like
this
but
it
is
a
bit
whimpy
for
a
brown
ale
to
me
very
drinkable
and
tastey
enough
but
not
the
best
i
would
gladly
drink
again
though
and
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
there
are
probably
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
but
this
will
do
the
job
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
sessionable
brown
ale
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
nice
to
be
back
in
pennsylvania
definitely
recommended
this
is
to
english
brown
ales
what
american
oktoberfests
like
sam
adams
are
to
german
oktoberfest
it
share
a
lot
of
basic
qualities
but
goes
a
little
darker
and
with
a
stronger
roasted
flavor
overall
its
darn
tasty
with
cocoa
black
roasted
grain
and
a
hint
of
walnut
the
aroma
is
a
little
tame
losing
the
great
chocolate
undertones
but
overall
this
is
a
good
looking
good
drinking
beer
yummy
deep
chestnut
colored
with
a
low
offshite
head
aromas
of
dark
malts
mixed
with
smoke
and
currant
dry
mouthfeel
a
bit
tannic
but
full
and
rich
lots
of
interesting
flavors
of
cocoa
smokey
charred
wood
molasses
caramel
and
some
ripe
cherry
very
smooth
and
balanced
flavor
nothing
too
big
tries
to
take
over
a
variety
of
flavors
move
in
and
out
reminds
me
almost
of
a
dry
stout
or
porter
really
great
beer
very
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
of
malt
with
nut
and
caramel
fragrances
easily
noted
the
taste
is
mostly
of
malt
with
nut
caramel
and
chocolate
characteristics
evident
the
body
is
medium
and
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
have
like
for
this
brew
the
finish
on
this
beer

as
with
the
other
troegs
i
have
tasted
is
quite
clean
ill
definitely
be
on
the
lookout
for
another
one
of
these
pours
a
ruby
hazlenut
brown
with
a
little
head
that
dies
pretty
quick
and
no
lacing
smells
nutty
with
a
slight
spice
and
vanilla
taste
is
simple
with
a
little
hop
and
malt
medium
in
the
mouth
with
favorable
carbonation
awesome
session
beer
that
is
good
for
all
occations
very
easy
to
drink
good
for
hanging
out
watery
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
easy
to
gulp
paired
with
vegetarian
chili
quite
nicely
nothing
spectacular
but
this
would
be
a
nice
fall
session
beer
i
usually
like
brown
ales
so
i
decided
to
give
this
troegs
a
try
it
poured
a
nice
brown
with
aromas
of
roasted
hazelnuts
and
a
hint
of
molasses
the
head
disappeared
quickly
though
on
the
palate
it
was
unfortunately
disappointing
you
still
have
the
roasted
nuts
but
too
light
of
a
body
and
not
enough
nuttiness
very
drinkable
though
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
a
bit
short
of
a
great
one
a
dark
velvet
almost
cola
tint
forms
minimal
head
syrupy
sugar
maltiness
in
the
nose
swift
thin
rush
to
the
throatdistributes
evenly
a
bit
too
fizzy
and
a
bit
too
unnutty
to
produce
high
marks
a
malt
presence
that
suggests
imbalance
with
time
the
taste
settles
in
the
tastebuds
not
among
the
better
nut
browns
but
not
a
turnoff
to
the
style
either
troegs
gets
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
normally
but
this
lacks
the
professed
toasted
tag
i
read
in
its
description
drinkability
this
was
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
friends
and
customers
flavor
is
a
lot
like
a
porter
in
many
ways
though
with
a
lighter
flavor
bakers
chocolate
hints
really
sell
this
overall
more
chocolatey
than
im
used
to
in
a
brown
ale
still
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
if
you
like
your
brown
ales
to
be
dark
and
full
flavored
like
porters
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
brown
slightly
amber
and
almost
cola
appearance
thin
tan
head
that
drops
to
a
film
right
away
the
film
does
mangage
to
leave
nice
speckled
lacing
smell
of
caramel
malt
but
the
real
highlight
of
the
smell
is
the
cocoa
the
cocoa
comes
to
the
front
in
the
taste
also
its
a
light
almost
creamy
cocoa
taste
with
very
little
bitterness
also
some
light
smokyness
and
some
toasted
nut
notes
finished
with
the
just
a
faint
earthy
bitterness
only
complaint
is
that
at
first
it
seamed
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
the
complexity
of
flavors
takes
over
and
i
loose
the
sense
that
it
is
thin
this
is
a
beer
that
ive
had
many
times
but
never
reviewed
as
expected
a
solid
offering
from
troegs
a
solidly
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
a
good
choice
any
time
deep
brown
almost
opaque
with
a
small
light
tan
head
that
is
quickly
gone
light
nose
hints
of
caramel
malts
and
very
light
crisp
hops
huge
mouth
with
caramels
but
not
sweet
and
heavy
as
in
an
eku
28
its
a
big
caramel
flavor
but
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
nuts
huh
well
if
you
say
so
i
suppose
i
get
a
little
nuttiness
out
of
it
but
it
could
just
be
the
power
of
suggestion
a
perfectly
good
session
ale
i
could
make
this
one
of
my
regular
line
up
with
no
problem
rugged
trail
is
right
up
there
with
troegenator
as
my
favorite
troegs
beers
also
makes
a
mighty
fine
pizza
dough
pours
a
rich
mahogony
with
a
one
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
dies
down
soon
after
pour
not
much
stickiness
at
all
smell
is
average
with
sweet
malty
goodness
and
some
roasted
nut
odors
as
well
taste
isnt
that
great
kind
of
bland
very
mild
caramel
flavors
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
as
well
starts
pretty
smooth
ends
up
quite
dry
very
light
mouthfeel
not
very
good
for
this
style
with
a
mild
carbonation
drinkability
would
be
pretty
good
just
because
there
is
no
alcohol
present
anywhere
but
im
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
brew
troegs
makes
amazing
beers
but
this
one
doesnt
fall
in
to
that
category
d
very
good
beer
has
a
little
more
chocolate
taste
than
most
nut
browns
notes
i
am
impressed
definitely
not
my
favorite
troegs
offering
nor
my
favorite
brown
but
to
pack
this
much
flavor
into
a
4
4
abv
is
a
testament
to
skill
of
the
brewers
at
troegs
a
nice
beer
to
sit
and
have
a
few
of
could
also
see
it
pairing
well
with
many
foods
a
decent
english
style
brown
although
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
troegs
lineup
easy
enough
to
drink
but
really
has
no
hook
in
it
to
make
me
want
a
second
one
overall
an
interesting
brown
ale
light
and
tasty
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
but
fails
to
be
great
because
its
a
little
too
thin
and
watery
id
like
some
more
body
and
more
robust
flavor
nice
though
and
easily
drinkable
pours
brown
with
a
thin
head
with
small
bubbles
smells
malty
with
a
distinct
roasted
coffee
aroma
good
malty
flavor
with
roasted
nuts
and
a
hint
of
coffee
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
and
smooth
finish
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
it
goes
great
with
snyders
hard
pretzels
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
it
has
more
character
than
many
american
browns
that
i
have
had
pours
a
very
attractive
clear
brownreddish
hightlights
thick
tan
head
forms
very
sticky
laces
nicely
with
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
and
nuts
some
chocolate
and
light
roast
maybe
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
is
nice
and
malty
some
fruits
bit
of
iron
chocolate
and
coffee
roast
caramel
nuttiness
bit
weak
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
refreshing
nice
to
drink
nice
brown
color
one
finger
head
with
big
bubbles
dissolves
pretty
quickly
no
lacing
solid
looking
alhtough
not
amazing
nose
is
pretty
subtle
toasted
malt
some
nutiness
but
pretty
mild
flavor
is
great
lots
of
sweet
malt
up
front
nuts
in
the
middle
along
with
spices
and
some
dried
fruit
gets
a
little
watery
as
it
keeps
going
feel
is
a
little
thin
especially
as
the
beers
goes
on
starts
out
really
solid
then
slips
a
little
but
still
another
good
one
from
troegs
im
a
belgian
brown
nut
and
this
beer
is
a
far
cry
from
anything
in
that
category
not
the
most
rugged
brown
that
ive
ever
tried
i
would
rather
something
with
a
bit
more
complexity
worth
a
shot
but
average
at
best
this
is
another
very
good
beer
from
troegs
i
like
this
brewery
more
and
more
every
day
drinkability
i
would
give
more
here
if
not
for
the
mild
syrupy
finish
the
subdues
flavor
helps
to
keep
you
from
getting
tired
of
this
brew
the
flavor
is
as
advertised
subdued
sweet
with
framing
bitterness
this
is
a
good
one
for
the
session
theres
a
husky
chocolateyness
too
this
beer
had
a
deep

a

make
this
a
very
drinkable

this
stands
out
to
me
as
a
superior
english
brown
it
has
a
great
character
and
good
taste

solid
leaning
more
towards
aggressive
than
subdued
in

again
what
this
beer
would
do
to
complement
a
burrito
or
tacos
with
a
side
of
refried
beans
would
be
perfection
the
low

gives
this
beer
the
opportunity
for

a

brown
ale
true
to
style
another
great
beer
from
troegs
very
restrained
british
style
and
not
nearly
as
full
as
an
american
brown
but
tasty
overall
and
quite
a
nice
session
beer
for
only
7
99
a
sixer
i
think
this
is
well
worth
the
money
and
ill
be
buying
it
again
although
my
scores
may
not
be
that
high
for
this
one
i
do
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
for
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
night
at
the
bar
especially
if
it
were
on
cask
an
aggressive
pour
yielded
a
2finger
head
that
was
tan
in
color
the
ale
itself
looked
the
color
of
cola
and
did
not
have
very
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
looked
otherwise
very
good
the
first
smells
hit
me
with
a
sweetish
almost
maple
smell
along
with
roasted
malt
the
taste
was
predominantly
the
roasted
and
burnt
malts
coming
through
watery
mouthfeel
and
almost
a
watery
taste
and
aftertaste
reminded
me
a
little
of
guiness
without
being
creamy
hardly
any
bubbling
going
on
in
the
mouthfeel
this
stuff
is
fairly
drinkable
due
to
the
low
abv
and
doesnt
hang
around
too
long
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
body
and
less
of
a
watery
aftertaste
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
head
this
quickly
faded
but
left
about
a
half
an
inch
of
frothy
cream
on
the
top
very
nice
lace
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
on
pouring
smell
could
have
been
a
bit
stronger
but
what
was
there
was
caramel
predominating
followed
by
hints
of
hazelnut
and
bread
and
yeast
tones
some
residual
grassy
hints
as
well
taste
was
rather
odd
when
cold
but
as
it
warmed
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
somewhat
muted
hoppiness
came
through
the
consistency
was
very
odd
had
a
slick
oily
feel
to
it
that
was
rather
off
and
could
also
feel
a
bit
syrupy
at
times
towards
the
end
i
seemed
to
have
found
a
bit
of
a
taste
for
it
as
it
seemed
to
start
to
come
off
better
would
like
to
try
this
again
as
it
may
have
been
a
bad
first
impression
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
when
all
is
said
and
done
d
despite
the
slightly
weak
body
still
a
good
brown
ale
definitely
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
bad
beer
just
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
the
style
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
very
dark
brown
color
almost
black
the
head
was
pretty
much
nonexistent
which
may
indicate
where
i
will
be
going
with
the
rest
of
this
review
the
small
head
also
had
very
fast
retention
which
did
not
even
yield
a
layering
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
afterwards
could
not
really
smell
anything
i
know
i
had
a
couple
so
to
double
check
i
passed
it
to
my
friend
and
she
said
she
could
not
smell
anything
either
therefore
i
deduce
a
poor
smelling
beer
which
did
not
get
me
too
excited
for
tasting
it
the
taste
was
okay
nothing
too
impressive
tasted
a
little
bit
on
the
bland
side
which
is
nto
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
english
brown
ale
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
sweetness
or
a
nutty
taste
to
it
but
neither
appeared
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
it
went
down
rather
smooth
overall
drinkability
i
would
have
to
go
with
not
too
impressed
the
lack
of
any
hint
of
character
in
taste
or
smell
does
not
really
make
a
good
beer
i
will
try
another
one
and
update
later
if
necessary
but
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
brew
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
during
an
early
fall
barbeque
not
more
than
three
or
four
as
this
beer
while
only
4
4
abv
still
is
pretty
filling
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
dont
dirnk
and
review
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
slightly
above
average
carbonation
and
much
like
water
the
main
flavor
component
of
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
waste
of
9
dollars
should
have
gone
with
the
oatmeal
stout
d
this
beer
has
a
smooth
lagered
quality
to
the
malt
flavors
but
still
has
some
nice
complexity
it
is
very
drinkable
with
no
off
flavors
drinkability
certainly
a
sessionable
brew
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
of
the
style
troegs
continues
to
prove
they
know
how
to
make
some
great
beers
this
stuff
is
very
good
there
were
3
of
the
beers
in
the
sampler
that
ide
buy
again
and
this
is
one
of
them
deff
a
browen
ale
to
try
for
anyone
looking
for
a
solid
brew
drinkability
really
enjoyed
this
brown
ale
overall
it
was
one
of
my
first
and
the
desire
for
more
sweetness
may
just
be
a
lack
of
understanding
on
my
part
of
the
style
id
definetly
have
another
and
recco
it
to
a
friend
12oz
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
and
some
slight
lacing
smells
mostly
of
roasted
malts
taste
of
a
burnt
malt
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
medium
body
mouth
feel
that
seemed
to
thicken
as
it
warmed
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
one
of
my
favorites
from
troegs
and
would
purchase
again
the
nut
brown
ale
poured
a
dark
brown
with
nice
lacing
and
a
vanishing
head
aromas
were
raosted
malts
with
a
slight
spice
taste
was
very
subtle
not
much
there
but
some
chocolate
notes
coupled
with
bready
malts
there
was
really
no
hop
flavor
to
balance
out
the
malts
to
create
a
cleaner
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
brew
tastes
watered
down
after
each
sip
with
more
flavor
and
and
a
crisper
finish
this
ale
would
be
much
better
pours
an
impressive
clear
redbrown
color
with
a
medium
head
of
large
tan
bubbles
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
light
body
whole
wheat
bread
with
a
touch
of
burnt
chocolate
malt
little
aftertaste
to
speak
of
an
enjoyable
low
alcohol
session
beer
thanks
for
the
bottle
muenchenerkindl
very
low
abv
going
on
here
so
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
definately
not
the
best
beer
from
the
troegs
boys
overall
not
too
big
of
a
fan
of
this
beer
love
their
other
ones
but
i
found
this
lacking
any
great
qualities
i
cant
help
but
keep
thinking
of
doppelbock
with
this
one
and
i
question
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
there
are
no
traces
of
skunk
or
infection
i
must
try
brown
ale
the
pour
into
my
sam
smith
pint
raises
a
creamy
two
finger
light
tan
head
over
a
dark
rubybrown
body
lacing
is
thick
and
sticky
head
retention
is
lacking
the
nose
is
full
of
molasses
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
roast
perhaps
theres
also
a
milk
chocolate
aroma
really
theres
not
much
but
its
very
nice
the
taste
is
very
balanced
between
initial
sweetness
and
ending
bitterness
there
are
chocolate
notes
floating
about
too
the
mouth
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
low
id
like
a
bit
more
fizz
personally
overall
an
easy
drinker
with
some
nice
notes
but
it
needs
more
strength
dnot
great
but
i
could
drink
a
few
this
is
a
very
drinkable
american
nut
brown
despite
being
watery
it
remains
an
awesome
session
beer
especially
during
the
fall
months
for
me
it
offers
a
pleasant
mix
of
bitter
and
sweet
nice
effort
by
troegs
not
the
greatest
but
pretty
good
its
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
watery
thinness
detracts
from
its
potential
on
the
ocassions
ive
had
this
the
bottom
line
has
always
been
an
okay
beer
pretty
much
hits
the
style
though
a
bit
thin
but
nothing
noteworthy
there
are
plenty
better
but
also
worse
brown
ales
thanks
for
letting
me
get
my
hands
on
this
one
muenchenerkindl
troegs
is
a
terrific
brewing
company
and
although
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
is
good
pour
a
dark
brown
amber
with
little
head
disappates
quickly
has
a
sweet
caramel
smell
with
a
little
coffee
nothing
offensive
about
it
at
all
can
be
drank
year
round
medium
body
with
a
sweet
spicey
taste
not
heavy
in
alcohol
so
many
can
be
consumed
in
a
session
drinkability
good
but
not
exceptional
easy
to
drink
and
inoffensive
but
there
are
better
brown
ales
out
there
drinkabilityoverall
falls
disappointingly
flat
from
its
initial
impression
has
the
nose
of
a
nice
new
glarus
fat
squirrel
with
the
thin
body
and
palate
of
a
newcastle
should
have
called
it
flat
squirrel
d
one
of
the
best
browns
i
have
ever
had
very
flavorful
compared
to
most
browns
i
have
tried
i
am
really
disappointed
this
is
not
available
to
me
locally
easy
to
drink
kind
of
standard
but
no
real
problems
drinkability
is
good
nothing
to
complain
about
but
not
a
i
cant
live
without
this
beer
also
prosit
mk
overall
an
extremely
drinkable
smooth
brew
that
is
sure
to
please
the
palate
can
be
light
at
times
but
a
good
offering
for
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
would
make
a
good
session
beer
overall
not
a
very
memorable
beer
didnt
taste
bad
but
not
much
to
say
about
it
this
beer
is
very
good
for
the
style
it
is
a
deep
brown
with
minimal
head
the
smell
has
caramel
hints
to
it
the
taste
is
smooth
there
is
no
harshness
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
nice
semibitter
finish
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
a
good
beer
from
a
brewer
i
wish
was
available
here
in
nc
this
brown
ale
is
pretty
smooth
mediumbodied
and
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
indeed
a
deep
brown
with
modest
initial
white
head
on
top
suitable
carbonated
aroma
of
nut
and
molasses
and
licorice
smooth
and
very
malty
drinkable
little
bitterness
from
hops
nice
transition
beer
good
example
of
its
style
moderate
alcohol
appreciated
as
a
session
beer
drinkability
at
4
4
abv
this
is
a
good
session
candidate
i
dont
think
session
when
i
think
brown
ale
suddenly
i
wonder
why
this
is
an
extremely
sessionable
beer
appearance
is
dark
black
little
head
to
speak
of
and
clearly
a
filtered
beer
nothing
special
there
good
enough
same
with
the
aroma
with
hints
of
a
sort
of
old
baroom
beer
smell
not
entirely
bad
per
se
just
not
a
strong
point
taste
is
good
solid
nut
brown
ale
territory
light
easy
malt
with
a
light
sweetness
no
real
prominent
taste
to
speak
of
but
nothing
adverse
to
the
taste
buds
either
more
of
a
session
beer
in
taste
than
anything
more
on
the
nutty
side
than
fruity
good
solid
mouthfeel
considering
the
overall
lightness
of
the
beer
extremely
drinkable
under
almost
any
circumstances
either
the
troeg
bros
have
been
tweaking
so
my
memory
is
faulty
but
to
me
this
is
significantly
better
than
it
was
a
couple
years
back
anyway
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
brown
ale
one
of
several
ive
rediscovered
lately
d
nice
stuff
great
session
beer
part
of
sampler
pack
drinkability
no
carbonation
that
was
that
noticable
not
filling
and
veryy
easy
to
drink
i
would
have
another
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
the
beer
has
a
dry
malty
finish
the
taste
never
really
seems
to
let
up
this
is
a
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoying
second
to
onlty
nugget
nectar
as
far
as
brews
from
this
brewery
that
i
have
had
highly
recommended
many
thanks
to
enola
for
picking
this
up
on
his
trip
to
tn
drinkability
at
4
4
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
could
theoretically
drink
them
all
night
but
at
some
point
i
might
want
something
with
a
bit
more
flavour
and
bite
drinkability
a
little
lacking
on
flavor
but
easy
to
consume
nice
session
beer
great
for
relaxing
i
could
have
a
few
more
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
into
my
pint
glass
the
aroma
i
get
is
of
toasted
malts
with
some
slight
sweetness
to
back
that
up
the
taste
is
also
nice
and
toasty
nutty
and
a
bit
sweet
this
beer
has
a
nice
full
body
after
a
few
more
sips
i
get
some
chocolate
notes
in
the
taste
very
enjoyable
beer
from
troegs
good
creamy
mouthfeel
if
slightly
watery
bit
of
metallic
flavour
upfront
but
it
goes
away
quickly
not
much
nuttiness
at
the
start
but
a
pleasant
malt
character
nuttiness
and
some
chocolate
notes
show
up
more
as
it
warms
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
for
my
liking
overall
not
bad
but
not
worth
seeking
out
again
this
is
the
best
nut
brown
ale
i
can
ever
remember
having
highly
drinkable
and
perfect
for
any
time
theres
a
modicum
of
earthiness
and
nice
flavor
but
its
thin
and
rapid
in
nature
meaning
a
blink
could
cost
you
much
of
the
experience
its
better
than
average
and
it
never
offends
but
its
like
a
shooting
star
gone
just
as
it
registers
still
it
flows
nicely
making
it
decently
drinkable
its
by
no
means
stellar
but
its
good
enough
to
not
turn
away
pours
a
dark
redtinged
brown
with
a
finger
of
foamy
beige
head
decent
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
a
light
walnut
scent
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
nice
gentle
nutty
roasty
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
on
the
sweet
side
but
balanced
with
the
slight
bitterness
of
the
roast
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
great
brown
ale
a
wonderfully
balanced
and
easy
drinking
session
beer
definitely
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
sampled
if
i
had
any
friends
in
this
godforsaken
town
i
would
invite
them
all
over
for
a
long
night
of
telling
lies
talking
smack
and
drinking
rugged
trail
nut
brown
drinkability
the
woman
at
the
store
i
purchased
from
asked
how
i
liked
this
style
of
troegs
and
i
mentioned
that
i
had
not
yet
tried
it
she
explained
that
she
particularly
liked
nut
brown
ales
and
i
suggested
hobgoblin
i
thought
this
was
even
better
well
balanced
tasty
and
as
i
would
expect
an
english
nut
brown
ale
to
taste
recommended
from
a
great
brewery
although
i
may
be
partial
as
a
close
resident
to
the
brewery
in
harrisburg
hopback
ale
is
their
masterpiece
drinkability
nothing
overly
complex
here
just
one
of
the
most
drinkable
browns
you
will
encounter
uf
the
finish
seems
british
from
the
get
go
as
a
eurostyle
hop
bite
kicks
off
a
walnut
chocolate
finishing
fade
this
beer
came
a
dark
cola
brown
with
some
reddish
orange
highlights
and
a
thin
creamy
white
head
smelled
of
roasted
caramel
and
molasses
malt
with
a
slight
sour
coffee
smelled
intimidating
sweet
tasted
of
very
sweet
burnt
caramel
with
a
pervasive
sourness
finished
clean
with
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
im
a
big
fan
of
sweeter
beers
but
this
was
a
bit
much
for
me
the
aroma
starts
out
fruity
and
nutty
with
some
sweet
caramel
after
a
while
i
detect
a
nice
buttery
aroma
followed
by
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
nice
blended
malt
flavor
that
is
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
i
can
also
taste
a
small
amount
of
warming
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
a
solid
nutbrown
rather
subdued
but
not
lacking
in
flavorahh
the
power
of
moderation
the
level
of
sweetness
is
nearly
perfect
and
wellbalanced
to
boot
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
weak
head
that
never
fully
develops
but
remains
present
for
quite
awhile
leaving
behind
a
touch
of
lacing
aromas
of
nutmeg
salted
peanuts
and
smoke
definitely
catches
my
interest
the
taste
is
mild
at
best
with
a
subtle
nutty
flavor
that
comes
out
slowly
over
time
and
blends
with
the
roasted
malts
also
present
the
relative
blandness
of
this
beer
is
not
a
bad
thing
when
paired
with
the
right
smokedgrilled
dishes
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
simple
final
thought
a
clear
step
above
goose
islands
nut
brown
ale
and
this
one
may
be
of
the
best
in
the
states
cheers
very
british
feeling
right
down
to
the
carbonation
put
this
in
a
500ml
bottle
and
id
be
fooled
quite
flavorful
and
satisfying
without
being
burdened
by
loads
of
alcohol
it
would
make
for
an
easy
session
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
coming
out
of
the
us
i
think
not
exactly
a
popular
style
but
i
like
it
a
lot
good
stuff
coming
out
of
this
brewery
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
dark
leathery
brown
with
a
1
finger
yellowtan
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
but
reduces
to
nothing
by
the
end
smells
buttery
and
nutty
with
some
gentle
hops
it
is
chocolatey
with
coffee
green
hops
and
a
mild
bitterness
with
a
medium
body
perhaps
my
least
favorite
of
their
offerings
but
still
a
good
sessionable
beer
pours
a
mediumdark
reddish
brown
with
a
mediumsized
offwhite
tight
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
thick
film
the
smell
is
wow
big
like
a
stout
with
aromas
of
chocolate
nuts
molasses
caramel
and
very
light
pine
the
taste
follows
with
more
big
roasted
malts
but
not
quite
as
big
as
the
aroma
milk
chocolate
plum
butterscotch
light
coffee
and
light
cookie
flavors
with
some
brown
sugar
and
herbal
notes
on
the
finish
it
has
a
mediumfull
body
smooth
texture
and
low
carbonation
another
very
good
offering
from
tröegs
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
this
was
one
of
the
beers
on
tap
at
my
wedding
regarding
my
mad
elf
review
hopefully
a
redo
will
be
coming
shortly
after
trying
it
on
tap
i
think
i
might
have
recd
a
bad
bottle
stay
tuned
keep
drinking
troegs
nut
brown
ales
are
not
my
favorite
in
general
but
i
guess
if
a
table
full
of
nut
browns
was
in
front
of
me
id
reach
for
this
one
mainly
because
it
is
so
mild
d
it
is
alright
it
is
too
mild
to
provoke
much
of
a
reaction
it
is
about
what
id
expect
coffee
mixed
with
seltzer
water
to
taste
like
it
is
still
fairly
good
it
would
pair
well
with
food
because
it
such
a
mild
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
extremes
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
pours
an
orangecopper
brown
with
a
thin
head
nose
is
soft
with
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
nuts
first
sip
is
nice
with
just
a
little
hops
if
you
go
searching
for
them
not
too
sweet
a
little
oak
and
walnut
appeared
late
an
easy
drinker
may
have
been
better
if
i
had
let
it
come
up
in
temp
first
but
average
was
all
that
kept
ringing
in
my
head
this
is
a
good
english
brown
its
dry
and
nutty
not
too
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
to
keep
you
interested
id
do
this
again
anytime
purchased
as
part
of

poured

i
want
to
say
this
is
the
first
beer
i
had
tried
by
troegs
more
then
5
years
ago
and
i
wasnt
impressed
then
they
can
do
better
for
sure
while
this

from
a
slightly
more
postive
review
from
18
months
ago
i
dont
see
this
being
worth
a
try
at
least
not
for
me
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
appearance
is
a
very
nice
reddishbrown
good
initial
head
but
fades
quickly
decent
lasting
lacing
smells
just
like
it
tastes
malty
rugged
trail
has
a
strong
malt
backbone
with
little
hops
contribution
some
aroma
but
i
dont
really
detect
bittering
taste
is
not
suprisingly
somewhat
sweet
and
smooth
and
coupled
with
the
relatively
low
abv
of
4
4
this
makes
for
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
brew
should
be
enjoyable
yearround
pours
a
dark
brown
with
garnet
ruby
highlights
shortlived
off
white
head
that
left
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malts
hints
of
leafy
hops
taste
is
sweet
malt
biscut
some
toffee
and
caramel
balanced
with
some
sourness
and
a
hop
essence
this
is
a
malty
brown
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
thin
though
what
one
would
expect
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
brew
and
will
definitely
buy
again
this
brew
pours
a
rubied
brown
color
with
a
small
ring
of
head
over
top
the
nose
is
caramel
and
slight
toasted
nut
kinda
weak
the
flavor
is
okay
roasted
nut
slightly
sweet
a
little
weak
the
feel
is
thin
to
moderate
nothing
really
grabs
me
overall
an
average
beer
it
doesnt
grab
me
in
any
way
overall
this
is
an
okay
brown
ale
im
not
particularly
fond
of
the
nutty
qualities
and
i
really
think
that
perhaps
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
but
i
would
probably
have
it
again
were
i
to
have
the
opportunity
12
oz

again
hops
played
hookie
this
day
too
spritzy
and
overcarbonated
for
its
style
a
little
too
burpy
just
a
bit
of
earthy
dryness
but
almost
not
noteworthy
im
guessing
this
beer
was
simply
geared
towards
being
a
sweeter
less
attenuated
beer
not
out
of
the
realms
of
its
style
not
bad
but
nothing
to
email
home
about
good
for
lovers
of
the
nut
brown
style
cant
say
id
call
this
one
a
sessioner
though
even
considering
the
reasonable
abv
dark
brown
pour
with
a
nicely
foamy
head
looks
really
tasty
smell
is
nutty
and
malty
but
not
much
else
and
very
faint
the
flavor
itself
is
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
tiny
earthy
notes
and
nutty
undertones
the
same
foam
that
makes
it
look
so
nice
lends
it
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
as
well
its
velvety
and
almost
feels
like
a
nitro
a
decent
enough
session
brew
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
nut
brown
but
the
flavors
not
bold
enough
to
really
set
it
apart
pours
a
clear
dark
colacolor
with
some
ruby
overtones
head
is
a
foamy
12
finger
wheat
color
it
sticks
around
only
briefly
before
fading
leaving
litle
lace
as
the
beer
is
consumed
the
nose
is
sweet
dark
malty
a
bit
of
nuts
or
dark
chocolate
really
not
a
lot
there
i
like
the
way
this
tastes
and
drinks
it
starts
with
sweet
dark
malt
with
subtle
but
distinct
dark
chocolate
accents
steppng
in
only
light
carbonation
yielding
silky
creamy
mouthfeel
thats
just
a
bit
thin
in
the
finish
hence
a
4
not
a
4
5
thanks
to
fish311d
for
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
one
just
sorry
it
wasnt
two
the
smell
is
good
with
sweet
roasty
malt
aromas
the
taste
is
medium
bodied
with
a
light
cocoa
roasted
flavor
very
flavorful
with
a
nice
hop
balance
overall
a
very
flavorful
but
light
enough
and
drinkable
enough
to
be
a
great
session

bitter
from

competes
with
fine
carbonation
on
my
tongue
a
bit
of
acidic
forms
later
tastes
reveal
chocolate
and
some
roast
character
that
comes
across
as
toffeelike
a
bit
more
burnt
grain
than
i
like
in
my
brown
ales
the
ending
is
dry
and
is
where
the
roast
character
makes
itself
most
noticable
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
quality
usually
found
in
oatmeal
stouts
moderately
carbonated
but
the
carbonation
thats
present
forms
sharp
fine
bubbles
on
my
tongue
the
head
quickly
settled
to
a
tiny
ring
around
the
glass
and
a
minimum
of
lacing
is
present
a
nice
beer
a
bit
too
roasty
for
me
more
umph
and
color
is
all
thats
necessary
to
make
this
offering
a
dry
porter
this
beer
has
a
dark
copper
color
but
is
transparent
there
is
not
much
head
not
much
aroma
but
what
is
there
smells
a
little
sour
great
nutty
malt
flavor
its
sweet
at
first
then
slightly
roasted
and
nutty
then
finishes
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
not
too
thick
low
in
alcohol
and
a
good
nutty
flavor
make
this
an
excellent
quaffing
beer
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
but
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
a
beautiful
rich
nutty
toffee
flavor
with
just
that
edge
of
roasted
bitterness
mild
hopiness
keeps
it
all
together
and
provides
wonderful
balance
really
lets
the
roasted
malt
come
through
pours

would

try

with
all
troegs
quite
drinkable
this
is
my
favorite
of
all
troegs
offerings
ive
tasted
unbelievably
nutty
and
chocolatey
tastes
unlike
any
other
beer
and
to
me
being
unique
is
the
most
important
characteristic
in
beer
i
love
it
thank
you
troegs
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
brown
ales
arent
usually
my
cup
of

this
was
a

and
drinkability
both
good
a
nice
representative
of
the
style
overall
i
recommend
you
try
this
beer
but
honestly
i
know
the
troeger
boys
can
do
much
better
and
have
done
much
better
id
love
to
score
some
mad

if
anyone
has
it
a
very
nice

the

light

is
medium
in

and
defintely
not
an

taste
is
nice
for
a

a

but
provide

pleasant
bittering
balance
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
the
style
is
far
from
my
favorite

is
a
fine

the

try
again

better
rugged

nut
brown
ale
is
another
good
troegs
beer
but
it
falls
short
of
very
good
even
though
id
like
to
see
a
bigger
body
the
one
that
has
been
provided
as
well
as
the
lowish
abv
means
that
drinkability
and

are
two
of
its

strengths

bit
lost
but
they
balance
the
sweetness
nicely
a
good
one
dark
reddish
brown
almost
burgundy
where
light
hits
the
corners
rather
beautiful
head
poured
thick
but
only
left
an
thin
cream
colored
ring
with
slight
lacing
light
carbination
not
too
flat
just
perfect
scent
of
coffee
toffee
caramel
the
taste
is
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
not
heavy
there
are
the
flavors
you
catch
in
the
scent
the
coffee
and
toffee
maybe
a
bit
of
dried
cherry
in
there
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
sooo
easy
very
good
brew
i
am
enjoying
this
one
tröegs
rugged
trail
nut
brown
ale
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
not
much
head
and
what
there
was
dissipated
quite
quickly
nice
aroma
very
coffee
like
with
hints
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
not
dissimilar
to
the
aroma
very
prominent
tastes
of
roasted
malts
some
sweet
malts
linger
on
the
palate
light
clean
mouthfeel
very
nice
great
bier
for
after
a
hard
days
work
highly
recommend
this
one
thanks
to
trbeer
for
continuing
to

me
excellent
east
coast
beers
a
rather
surprising
find
at
a
local
haunt
this
ambercoloured
brew
gave
me
a
light
beigetotan
head
from
the
onset
the
aroma
was
righ
of
malts
and
nuts
with
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
mixed
in
perhaps
maple
the
flavor
was
rather
smooth
and
the
nuts
again
worked
their
way
into
the
flavor
as
did
some
residual
sweetness
at
the
finish
a
solid
brew
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
dark
roasted
scent
with
some
nutty
and
chocolate
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
black
and
roasted
barley
flavor
with
some
nutty
flavors
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
with
good
mouthfeel
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
it
has
great
malt
character
and
an
awesome
nutty
brown
flavor
this
is
a
fine
sessions
ale
drinkabilitynotes
wow
this
is
a
fantastic
brown
ale
flavors
are
top
notch
alcohol
level
is
low
enough
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
newcastle
would
do
well
to
study
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
the
is
a
thinner
bodied
brown
ale
the
roasted
nuttiness
lasts
softly
on
the
tongue
for
several
seconds
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
ale
as
the
nuttiness
is
light
and
not
overbearing
this
brew
was
mildly
deceptive
ill
tell
you
why
at
the
end
of
this
review
but
lets
just
say
the
deception
could
have
been
avoided
with
a
bit
of
patience
pours
a
nice
brownish
amber
colour
with
a
decent
sized
tan
head
which
couldve
hung
around
a
bit
longer
though
it
left
a
nice
sticky
residue
on
the
glass
smells
a
bit
thin
a
first
a
little
sweet
a
little
malt
and
a
bit
nutty
but
give
it
a
few
minutes
and
youll
pick
up
some
earth
tones
and
some
chocolate
as
well
the
taste
is
more
nutty
and
earthy
than
the
smell
and
also
has
some
burnt
bread
qualities
to
it
malt
is
apparent
throughout
and
this
one
finishes
burnt
and
dry
nothing
amazing
but
one
of
the
more
complex
and
enjoyable
brown
ales
ive
sampled
the
problem
with
this
one
was
that
i
was
so
eager
to
try
it
i
poured
it
immediately
upon
returning
home
from
the
store
where
it
has
been
sitting
for
a
while
in
a
cold
cooler
let
it
sit
out
for
10
or
15
minutes
or
so
and
this
one
will
be
that
much
more
complex
i
actually
had
it
rated
a
bit
lower
based
on
the
first
cooler
half
of
the
bottle
as
it
warmed
it
certainly
improved
pours
a
deep
brown
with
some
reddish
tint
with
not
much
head
to
speak
ofthe
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
with
some
light
fruitinessto
it
flavor
had
bready
maltiness
to
it
with
some
nice
fruity
estures
with
a
light
chocolate
flavor
in
the
finishnot
your
typical
brown
in
my
opinion
neither
nutty
or
real
chocolaty
but
i
think
a
real
nice
beer
none
the
less
a
nice
clear
brownamber
color
which
when
roused
forms
a
light
amber
colored
head
there
is
a
malty
biscuit
type
aroma
that
is
accompanied
by
a
bit
of
hop
character
as
well
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
biscuit
notes
that
finishes
with
some
toasty
chocolate
notes
it
has
some
pleasing
hop
flavor
as
well
though
this
is
quite
restrained
and
a
bitter
finish
quite
a
good
brown
ale
with
some
nice
toasted
malt
flavors
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
there
is
a
malty
presence
tastey
hints
of
chocolate
and
maybe
a
bit
of
toffee
aftertaste
there
is
a
slight
nutty
taste
and
overall
it
is
quite
smooth
a
very
nice
beer
first
sip
is
sweet
and
malty
with
undertones
of
almonds
and
some
caramel
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
strange
creamy
texture
to
it
this
actually
reminds
me
of
a
dairy
product
and
is
a
little
strange
the
brew
has
average
carbonation
and
is
very
smooth
the
finish
lingers
with
a
mild
sweet
flavor
in
my
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
of
a
put
off
for
me
but
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
i
think
i
could
have
a
few
more
oh
yea
i
do
have
more
in
my
brewers
dozen
pack
very
crisp
brew
with
a
nice
medium
body
it
is
nice
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
the
backbone
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
it
is
well
balanced
with
some
light
roasty
notes
some
nutty
flavors
are
in
there
as
well
this
is
an
excellent
session
brew
it
is
not
very
heavy
but
it
does
have
a
good
amount
of
body
and
flavor
drinkability
another
decent
malty
beer
from
these
guys
great
beer
to
have
on
a
crappy
rainy
day
nice
and
hearty
would
make
a
great
session
beer
for
the
malt
lovers
among
us
dark
brown
beer
with
amber
highlights
head
fell
back
quickly
aroma
of
chocolate
and
slight
nutty
caramel
aroma
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
which
dries
out
into
a
finish
with
lasting
light
bittersweet
chocolate
the
body
is
kind
of
watery
and
light
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
color
is
a
dark
reddishbrown
almost
mahogany
with
auburn
highlights
at
edges
of
glass
when
held
up
to
light
no
head
to
speak
of
just
a
tiny
ring
of
foam
around
edge
and
a
thin
film
of
foam
at
the
center
of
the
beer
no
carbonation
no
lace
aroma
starts
out
with
dark
rich
maltiness
that
lasts
its
way
through
the
entire
nose
faint
smell
of
hops
emerges
after
agitation
otherwise
almost
entirely
a
sweet
dark
malt
scent
with
hints
of
toffee
and
perhaps
coffee
a
scent
of
hop
freshness
starts
to
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
thankfully
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
brown
ales
coffee
is
much
stronger
as
a
flavor
than
a
scent
as
are
dark
roasted
nuts
prominent
flavor
of
toasted
almond
skins
up
front
gradually
gives
way
to
a
slightly
creamy
mellower
maltiness
in
the
back
of
the
palate
that
becomes
more
apparent
as
tasting
progresses
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
slightly
syrupy
around
edge
of
palate
with
a
nice
nearcreaminess
in
midpalate
accompanying
warming
malt
drinkability
is
good
but
id
rather
have
one
or
two
of
these
with
desserti
bet
this
would
be
awesome
with
white
chocolate
and
macadamia
nuts
not
my
favorite
from
troegs
but
a
fine
beer
though
my
favorite
brown
ales
are
the
highoctane
ones
for
a
low
abv
brown
ale
this
is
excellent
much
better
than
newcastle
id
likely
have
this
one
again
this
beer
poured
out
a
very
clear
amber
to
light
brown
color
topped
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissolved
quickly
there
are
some
fruity
notes
in
the
aroma
along
with
bittersweet
chocolate
and
buttery
caramel
chocolate
and
roasted
grains
come
through
in
the
flavor
light
malt
body
that
really
thinned
out
as
the
beer
warmed
up
finishes
clean
and
has
some
flavor
but
nothing
there
that
knocks
my
socks
off
ive
had
several
troegs
beers
now
and
i
continue
to
be
impressed
i
think
there
are
better
nut
browns
out
there
but
this
one
has
to
rank
near
the
top
of
my
list
i
would
purchase
this
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
drinkability
as
said
before
this
is
a
great
session
beer
its
great
flavor
smell
and
low
alcohol
makes
it
a
beer
you
wont
get
tired
of
and
it
wont
trip
you
on
your
way
to
the
pisser
pours
a
very
deep
brown
underneath
a
huge
creamy
head
a
powerful
aroma
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
first
greets
the
senses
the
first
sip
brings
forth
a
roasted
malt
flavor
with
deep
malty
sweet
caramel
notes
the
body
is
quite
smooth
and
pairs
nicely
with
a
very
mellow
light
bitterness
flowing
throughout
color
is
a
dark
amber
brown
with
very
little
head
present
aroma
is
slightly
of
toasted
malt
no
hop
aroma
detectable
taste
is
initially
slighlty
sweet
with
some
ale
fruitiness
finishes
malty
with
toasted
hints
very
little
hop
flavor
and
low
bitterness
nice
comparitively
full
mouthfeel
for
the
gravity
a
smooth
drinking
beer
that
i
recommend
for
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
southern
english
brown
ale
style
very
dark
brownish
red
ale
with
a
nice
looking
foamy
tannish
head
smell
is
mainly
of
english
hops
nothing
overpowering
nice
chocolaty
taste
with
a
good
coffee
bitterness
that
make
for
a
nice
dry
mouthfeel
hints
of
hoppiness
in
the
taste
that
go
well
with
sweet
chocolate
maltiness
nothing
overpowering
here
just
a
pleasant
tasty
brew
thats
quite
drinkable
nice
job
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
im
not
ordinarily
a
fan
of
nut
brown
ales
but
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
an
exception
pours
a
great
looking
mahogany
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
head
which
doesnt
last
very
long
has
a
buttery
caramel
or
coffee
type
flavor
but
without
being
overpowering
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
hops
are
in
the
background
but
theyre
present
nonetheless
very
drinkable
not
at
all
heavy
although
this
review
is
for
the
bottled
version
i
have
also
recently
had
the
draft
version
and
would
have
no
changes
to
the
above
although
for
once
i
think
i
prefer
the
bottled
to
the
draft
by
a
very
thin
margin
troegs
has
come
through
again
with
this
product
i
had
this
on
tap
while
in
lancaster
county
this
weekend
it
was
served
in
a
strange
glass
similar
to
a
hurricanenot
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
brown
ale
but
i
attribute
this
to
the
fact
that
i
had
it
at
an
upscale
tavern
that
was
pretentious
and
geared
towards
fine
dining
the
beer
is
a
mahogany
brown
that
almost
looks
red
not
amber
in
the
light
there
is
a
faint
head
that
quickly
subsides
the
smells
are
nutty
and
burnt
the
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
and
mild
in
the
fashion
of
most
brown
ales
the
beer
also
had
a
certain
sweetness
to
it
while
still
offering
tastes
of
burnt
nut
almond
faint
choco
and
malt
the
beer
was
suprsingly
thin
considering
its
character
and
it
had
a
very
watery
feel
across
my
palette
this
is
not
to
say
it
was
watered
down
but
it
does
have
a
very
subdued
feel
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
the
mouth
interested
a
very
good
brown
ale
though
i
cant
really
say
how
it
stacks
up
against
the
classic
english
nut
browns
as
my
experience
is
limited
id
have
it
again
especially
in
the
late
summer
and
early
autumn
as
it
would
pair
well
with
many
seasonal
nuances
in
foods
and
atmosphere
this
brown
ale
is
great
troegs
has
done
a
nice
job
with
the
brown
ale
mild
is
the
word
for
this
brew
the
smell
is
quite
mellow
with
hints
of
raisins
or
dates
the
head
is
thin
but
resilient
making
its
way
down
the
glass
and
leaving
quite
a
lacing
behind
the
taste
has
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
hops
are
quite
subdued
and
the
malts
are
warm
and
mellow
the
carbonation
is
very
thin
and
that
makes
for
quite
a
session
beer
rugged
trail
feels
very
smooth
in
your
mouth
and
cleanses
the
palate
as
it
refreshes
it
goes
well
with
a
lot
of
foods
at
4
4
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
goes
down
great
in
any
setting
good
representation
of
the
brown
ale
style
nice
one
francisweizen
translucent
rubybrown

tiny
bubbly
beige
head
that
faded
quickly
no
lace
either
very
inviting
nose
nutty
chocolate
upfront
with
very
mild
sweetness
and
caramel
influences
at
the
end
a
smidge
onedimensional
relatively
complex
palate
for
a
brown
ale
chocolate
malts
spicy
but
subdued
hops
nutty
distant
caramel
tasty
the
body
is
too
thin
the
carbonation
is
minimal
and
this
combination
creates
a
distraction
in
the
overall
enjoyment
of
drinking
it
it
is
easy
to
drink
aside
from
chalkiness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
medium
body
the
finish
is
pleasant
the
aftertaste
is
nutty
chocolate
bitterness
grows
as
the
beer
warms
nice
touch
the
low
abv
is
a
key
in
making
this
beer
work
as
well
as
it
does
a
solid
brown
ale
this
beer
came
to
me
a
crystal
clear
mahoganynut
color
that
had
an
orange
hue
to
it
and
was
well
carbonated
it
created
a
light
tanbeige
colored
head
that
was
fairly
thick
dense
and
creamy
the
foam
left
behind
a
faint
lace
behind
that
was
spotty
in
areas
the
aromas
were
fairly
simple
and
light
roasted
nuts
and
malt
flowers
and
a
light
cocoa
powder
flavors
had
more
of
a
dimension
to
it
roasted
malts
light
floral
hops
nuts
fruit
some
sweet
malt
as
it
warmed
and
detected
in
the
mid
of
the
sip
cocoa
powder
and
burnt
chocolate
at
the
end
it
left
a
roasted
chocolate
nut
flavor
behind
on
the
tongue
light
to
medium
bodied
this
beer
became
nuttier
and
creamier
as
it
warmed
its
light
alcohol
content
makes
it
a
good
session
beer
and
its
clean
flavors
keep
it
from
getting
boring
if
you
are
just
sitting
around
and
having
a
few
with
friends
a
happily
finished
brown
no
wait
theres
a
few
ounces
left
ah
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
tone
with
a
thin
but
frothy
beige
head
and
with
each
sip
this
beer
leaves
even
patterns
of
lace
around
the
glass
aroma
consists
of
a
healthy
serving
of
malted
barley
giving
this
ale
layers
of
sweetness
entwined
with
a
nutty
almond
esque
tone
very
nice
appeasing
aroma
perfect
in
every
sniff
of
this
divine
nectar
in
the
sip
there
are
some
dark
roasts
giving
a
harsh
tone
within
the
sweet
nutty
flavors
dancing
in
this
lightly
hopped
ale
very
clean
finish
a
refreshing
wonder
for
the
style
very
well
made
beer
from
harrisburg
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
with
all
of
the
well
done
flavors
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
overall
score
that
badly
a
definite
session
nut
brown
ale
meant
to
be
enjoyed
one
after
another
a
couple
at
a
time
at

abv
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
thoroughly
f
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
the
bottle
mmmm
and
its
delicious
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
has
a
very
nice
lowcarbonated
smoothness
to
it
big
flavors
of
nuts
and
mild
chocolate
notes
and
a
surprisingly
dark
roasty
malt
flavor
quite
impressive
a
wonderful
effort
at
the
style
to
me
its
right
up
there
with
rogues
hazlenut
brown
nectar
good
lord
my
glass
is
almost
empty
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
head
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
ring
of
foam
the
aroma
is
very
nutty
and
sweet
with
a
nice
dark
chocolate
note
maybe
even
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
or
coffee
the
taste
is
very
good
with
a
great
roasted
hazlenut
taste
also
nice
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
is
present
in
the
finish
but
just
to
cleanse
the
palate
it
is
not
a
major
player
in
the
overall
taste
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
like
chocolate
covered
coffee
beans
just
a
touch
of
eathy
graininess
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
liven
things
up
a
bit
the
drinakbility
is
very
good
another
fine
brew
from
the
trogner
brothers
this
beer
makes
you
slow
down
complex
flavors
well
blended
well
this
is
brown
ale
and
that
is
the
color
it
poured
a
dark
brown
it
is
meet
with
a
small
off
white
head
on
the
top
the
head
faded
and
left
very
little
lace
the
aroma
has
hint
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
and
small
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
has
a
nutty
flavor
to
it
with
the
hints
of
coffee
and
sweet
malt
there
is
a
very
mild
hint
of
hops
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
light
and
very
drinkable
quite
nice
chocolate
nose
with
some
fruitiness
pours
an
amber
brown
color
with
a
thing
light
brown
head
that
is
quite
creamy
and
laces
nicely
chocolate
and
a
sweetness
are
evident
from
the
start
with
a
roasted
nuttiness
coming
out
as
the
beer
warms
slightly
slick
but
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
bitterness
lingers
on
the
side
of
the
tongue
for
a
while
after
each
sip
this
one
poured
out
with
a
quickly
fading
medium
tan
head
over
attractive
dark
reddishbrown
liquid
nose
is
a
nice
smelling
blend
of
light
chocolate
and
dry
coffee
aromas
mixed
with
some
malty
sweetness
quite
an
appetizing
mix
taste
is
indeed
nutty
with
a
tasty
background
chocolate
character
that
changes
to
a
malt
based
sweet
note
with
subdued
hoppiness
finishes
clean
and
a
bit
dry
on
the
palate
the
easytoquaff
character
and
relatively
light
alcohol
content
makes
for
a
super
session
ale
a
good
session
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
earthy
and
sweet
without
being
cloying
especially
because
of
the
low
carbonation
which
makes
for
a
mellow
quaffability
and
the
low

the

gently
becons
you
with

note
thats
laced
with

the
flavor
however
is

with

and
caramel
malt
thats
only
fringed
with
roastiness
and
very
mildly
infused
with
hop
character
similar
in
many
ways
to
a

dunkle
bitterness
is
kept
to
a
minimum
to
accentuate
the
malt
but
still
balances
a
soft
note
of
cocoa
lingers
on
the
palate
in
a
short
and
dry
finish
exceptional
a
really
quaffable
pint
that
still
offers
generous
amounts
of
malt
character
and
some
limited
complexity
i
love
the
look
of
a
darker
beer
and
troegs
nut
brown
delivered
this
wonderfully
it
held
a
deep
brownish
red
color
with
a
fairly
thin
head
very
little
lace
however
i
expected
a
welldeveloped
nutty
scent
from
this
ale
but
only
a
small
hint
of
burnt
nuts
and
malt
filled
my
nostrils
i
was
a
little
disappointed
but
the
smell
was
still
subtely
pleasant
the
burnt
nutty
aspect
was
also
present
in
the
taste
while
malts
and
hops
worked
intricately
before
swallowing
the
nut
character
really
becomes
apparent
immediately
afterwards
the
medium
body
makes
for
a
nice
mouthfeel
too
the
nut
brown
drinks
very
easily
like
a
lighter
ale
but
encompasses
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
good
nut
brown
id
recommend
the
troegs
to
any
fan
of
the
style
let
me
start
by
saying
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
despite
an
appetizing
name
most
do
nothing
or
worse
for
me
this
one
from
troegs
though
is
exceptional
theres
a
lot
going
on
and
it
finishes
with
a
wonderful
justright
hoppiness
not
too
big
not
too
small
just
right
whos
been
sitting
my
chair
slightly
brownish
copper
color
with
nice
head
and
lace
smells
somewhat
mute
but
fresh
clean
tasting
with
nice
hop
presence
and
slight
toasted
almondy
character
very
refreshing
with
a
alcoholic
finish
wow
another
really
fine
example
from
the
two
brothers
at
troegs
first
off
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
might
just
be
the
one
to
put
me
over
the
top
pours
a
rich
amberbrown
with
a
full
tan
head
that
never
quite
goes
away
smells
of

of

and

initial

followed
by
a

really

the

the

nothing

i
find
nauseating

doesnt

the

in
it
any
more
an
acquired
taste
which
i
never
managed
to
acquire

i

it
is
a
very
bland
beer
i
like
new

brown
ale
it
has
a
great
wheat
taste
very
fulling
but
if
your
buying
it
in
the
states
its
just
to
much
of
a
price
for
a
pint
this
is
my
grocery
bought
beer
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
sweet
taste
and
pleasant
all
around
easy
beer
to
drink
being
a
malt
beer
every
beer
guy
would
enjoy
this
everyday
after
a
long
day
at
work
my
favorite
brown
ale
as
i
read
the
previous
ratings
and
reviews
i
am
wondering
if
i
am
doing
something
wrong
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
it
is
best
on
tap
though
tons
better
then
from
the
bottle
but
isnt
that
the
way
it
is
for
most
beers
new
castle
where
is
this
castle
people
keep
talking
about
all
i
see
is
an
old
moat
of
a
beer
its
a
boring
cemical
tasting
joke
of
an
ale
never
worth
to
buy
no
complexity
at
all
easy
drinking
reasonably
enjoyable
easy
drinking
but
boring
sessionable
brown
ale
very
good
beer
o
like
so
much
a
really
enjoyable
beer
goes
down
easily
very
good
brown
ale
with
pretty
good
quality
this
was
my
brown
ale
of
choice
a
while
back
that
i
would
get
in
12
packs
before
i
got
into
all
the
dark
brown
ales
stouts
porters
etc
actually
a
decent
beer
if
you
are
quaffing
a
few
and
doing
stuff
outside
in
the
summer
its
not
the
sort
of
beer
you
really
want
to
sit
down
with
to
analyze
all
the
subtle
complexities
and
richness
nice
caramel
color
with
above
average
flavor
o
not
amazing
i
would
like
to
try
it
from
a
can
but
they
only
sell
them
in
4
packs
i
had
a
smaller
bottle
in
las
vegas
with
a
burger
and
fries
and
that
format
works
better
for
me
overall
i
find
the
newcastle
brown
ale
badly
crafted
and
stale
first
off
let
me
state
i
like
this
ale
period
i
dont
care
about
heads
or
lacing
at
all
i
drink
beer
for
two
reasons
only
the
taste
and
the
buzz
i
get
just
a
hint
of
something
floral
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bittereven
though
i
do
like
a
hoppy
beer
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
the
mouth
feel
is
silkyhonestly
the
aroma
is
rather
weak
but
i
dont
like
strong
smelling
beers
i
have
been
searching
for
my
brand
of
beer
including
making
home
brew
and
i
have
found
it
we
are
all
different
and
this
brown
ale
suits
my
taste
beautfully
we
all
have
our
opinions
this
is
mine
im
a
fan
and
because
of
the
region
i
live
in
there
really
isnt
a
lot
of
choices
and
for
the
buck
of
a
mass
produced
brew
its
for
me
a
nice
classic
people
are
too
harsh
on
this
classic
daily
beater
metallic
taste
almost
faint
hint
of
it
good
all
purpose
beer
drinkable
i
am
really
surprised
by
the
poor
reviews
on
this
beer
it
really
makes
me
question
the
experts
expertise
by
no
means
is
this
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
drank
but
it
is
a
really
good
all
purpose
beer
it
goes
well
with
food
relaxation
refreshment
and
just
to
fill
that
beer
craving
very
soft
mouthfeel
but
its
not
really
compensated
with
an
overly
crisp
and
refreshing
feel
either
its
just
kind
of
blah
the
taste
is
much
the
same
if
there
was
a
malt
liquor
that
made
a
brown
beer
this
wouldnt
be
far
from
it
very
grainy
and
unpleasant
alcohol
feel
even
though
its
quite
low
would
not
drink
this
beer
for
free
my
introduction
to
the
style
and
still
a
really
nice
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
clean
subdued
nuttiness
and
easy
drinking
good
stuff
my
go
to
beer
at
buffalo
wild
wings
overall
kind
of
an
unremarkable
beer
sort
of
flimsy
and
not
very
pronounced
in
the
flavor
department
an
ok
beer
to
have
when
everything
else
on
hand
is
bmc
or
fruitaritatype
nonsense
one
of
the
best
3
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
think
bodied
reminds
me
of
a
light
twisted
tea
nothing
really
going
on
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
with
a
little
skunkiness
that
reminds
me
off
a
heineken
not
a
great
brown
ale
most
industrial
pale
lagers
are
tastier
than
this
the
type
of
beer
you
buy
and
drink
in
large
quantities
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
cream
color
head
that
disappates
quickly
to
leave
little
lacing
aroma
is
malt
sweetness
a
bit
like
dulche
de
leche
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
a
small
hint
of
nutty
flavor
not
much
hop
bitterness
or
yeast
flavor
mouthfeel
feel
is
thin
but
drinkabke
overall
the
beer
is
average
but
holds
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
tastes
great
very
light
and
refreshing
a
relatively
aggressive
pour
results
in
a
one
inch
offwhite
head
and
a
strong
malt
aroma
wafts
up
a
gentle
pour
results
in
not
much
of
a
head
and
not
as
much
aroma
dark
brown
coffee
color
the
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
with
clinging
lacing
that
follows
the
beer
down
the
side
of
the
glass
as
you
drink
sweet
malt
aroma
if
you
take
a
whiff
with
your
nose
in
the
glass
taste
backs
up
the
aroma
with
a
dusty
english
malt
flavor
full
malt
taste
with
some
bitterness
in
the
coming
through
just
a
touch
of
hops
that
fades
quickly
the
english
yeast
does
come
through
but
i
would
have
liked
to
have
had
it
be
more
assertive
to
balance
the
malt
dominance
even
though
a
bit
onedimensional
it
is
very
flavorful
lightly
carbonated
as
is
typical
for
an
english
ale
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
youll
never
guess
malty
and
it
lingers
for
awhile
while
it
is
sweet
it
is
not
overly
or
cloyingly
so
this
ale
is
meant
to
be
consumed
at
english
pub
temperature
if
you
drink
it
too
cold
it
will
taste
thin
and
watery
it
needs
to
be
at
the
proper
temperature
to
be
fully
appreciated
so
if
you
refrigerate
it
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
the
body
and
mouth
feel
improves
noticeably
at
4
7
abv
this
does
meet
the
session
criteria
here
in
the
usa
but
it
is
a
bit
to
strong
for
that
in
the
uk
this
ale
while
pleasant
and
flavorful
it
too
onedimensional
for
me
pours
clear
deep
amber
color
very
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
hardly
any
lacing
malty
flavor
with
a
tart
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
not
bad
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
unpleasant
this
is
my
fourth
favorite
beer
fave
beer
ever
and
i
have
tried
a
lot
affectionately
known
as
the
newkie
in
my
group
of
mates
this
to
me
is
a
perfect
brew
to
have
when
having
a
chat
in
the
pub
admittedly
there
is
a
fairly
strong
initial
taste
when
first
trying
and
it
is
effectively
a
marmite
scenario
in
that
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
there
is
no
real
inbetween
on
that
front
but
in
regards
to
my
opinion
which
lets
be
fair
my
review
and
all
that
it
is
a
good
drink
to
have
when
relaxing
in
the
pub
with
mates
as
well
as
that
i
found
it
to
be
a
good
opener
before
a
night
out
but
i
would
say
dont
drink
repeatedly
all
night
as
it
has
a
tendency
to
make
you
feel
heavier
and
perhaps
more
sluggish
best
thing
out
of
newcastle
since
ant
and
dec
ive
enjoyed
this
brew
before
it
was
popular
in
the
u
s
and
will
continue
to
do
so
been
to
newcastle
best
pour
came
from
a
local
pub
with
awesome
company
overall
quite
a
nice
english
brown
ale
if
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
liking
definitely
not
a
sessional
which
is
good
at
au72
a
case
or
22
a
6pack
well
it
had
an
interesting
bottle
cap
i
guess
very
popular
not
sure
why
there
are
way
better
versions
of
this
style
out
there
one
of
my
first
imported
beers
its
a
standard
at
many
restaurants
and
pubs
now
but
its
reliable
and
delicious
its
my
go
to
brew
not
to
shabby
i
like
brown
ales
this
isnt
the
best
by
any
stretch
but
its
not
the
worst
either
very
drinkable
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
a
wonderful
memory
in
las
vegas
my
favorite
beer
a
lot
of
caramel
and
oats
o
good
beer
but
there
are
drawbacks
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
your
basic
brown
ales
and
thats
exactly
what
this
beer
is
i
suppose
it
goes
well
with
british
pub
food
but
i
can
probably
do
better
ive
always
wanted
to
try
this
beer
and
ending
up
grabbing
a
pint
of
it
from
my
local
store
the
other
day
i
was
disappointed
in
this
brew
to
begin
with
but
it
grew
on
me
has
a
distinctly
corny
smell
and
flavor
that
im
not
in
love
with
but
isnt
bad
per
se
an
unusual
aftertaste
too
maybe
due
to
the
lack
of
hops
very
sweet
ill
gladly
finish
the
pint
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
up
a
six
pack
121612
from
bottle
at
home
flavor
is
ok
but
not
much
body
would
like
to
think
that
draft
would
be
an
improvement
my
favorite
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
mysterious
but
pleasantly
sweet
aroma
nothing
special
about
the
lacing
tan
head
or
brown
body
though
overall
newcastle
is
a
very
very
easy
beer
to
drink
with
little
risk
and
little
reward
one
of
my
favorites
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
score
so
low
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
since
learned
new
castle
is
made
with
inferior
ingredients
it
is
not
very
good
quality
and
made
with
brown
coloring
it
has
become
beer
pong
beer
for
me
great
taste
tho
lacks
body
and
flavor
lots
of
adjuncts
skunked
from
the
clear
bottle
and
this
is
the
dominating
flavor
update
as
promised
i
had
to
pick
up
a
12
pack
of
this
brew
yep
its
that
smooth
a
light
beer
with
power
taste
if
only
moose
drool
was
this
good
nice
coffee
color
with
a
perfect
amount
of
head
nice
smooth
flavor
with
a
sweet
finish
not
bitter
like
your
typical
brown
ale
definitely
fly
a
good
one
pours
a
dark
brown
medium
head
which
slightly
fades
aroma
caramel
hint
of
toffee
taste
slightly
sweet
lots
of
malt
pleasantly
surprised
was
expecting
much
will
be
drinking
again
nice
sweet
caramel
flavor
with
very
good
lacing
i
call
it
the
dessert
of
beers
o
thought
it
was
better
a
few
years
back
not
sure
why
it
has
quality
control
issues
except
for
the
clear
bottle
sometimes
good
sometimes
bad
if
it
is
on
sale
at
the
local
grocery
id
still
pick
up
a
few
for
bbqs
though
from
can
a
bit
of
a
malty
hay
aroma
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
offwhite
head
light
sweet
taste
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
and
a
mild
bitter
finish
overall
nice
appearance
but
very
little
flavor
add
in
the
skunk
fault
and
i
would
not
recommend
this
overall
this
is
bad
wont
be
buying
again
wont
be
recommending
drinkability
though
not
a
great
offering
in
my
very
humble
opinion
but
solidly
drinkable
after
a
hard
days
work
however
it
did
not
go
well
with
typical
fried
appetizers
but
im
thinking
could
add
some
nice
dimension
to
fallwinter
soups
or
stews
it
may
also
cut
greasiness
of
dishes
such
as
roast
pork
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
but
im
new
to
the
craft
beer
scene
i
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
this
market
so
bear
with
me
i
hope
to
get
more
experience
as
time
goes
on
if
ya
have
any
recommendations
them
that
would
be
sweet
thanks
and
aloha
will
never
seek
out
purchase
or
even
drink
again
this
or
water
take
the
water
not
bad
kinda
reminds
me
of
budweiser
with
less
gas
little
smoother
too
this
used
to
be
my
goto
when
i
first
started
drinking
beer
but
ive
gotten
used
to
the
bitterness
of
hops
now
which
this
has
zero
of
little
malty
and
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
o
clear
bottles
equal
skunk
taste
and
smell
i
think
this
is
a
terrible
beer
it
is
probably
not
light
struck
on
draft
but
i
seldom
choose
this
beer
to
consume
i
bought
a
six
pack
to
remind
myself
of
why
i
never
drink
it
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
english
beer
o
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
review
fantastic
color
but
not
completely
correct
in
fact
nothing
about
this
beer
seems
correct
i
find
it
hard
to
give
it
a
bad
review
though
nothing
special
but
around
here
where
bottled
ales
are
hard
to
find
and
fairly
expensive
a
reasonably
priced
one
was
worth
a
shot
even
if
it
has
caramel
colouring
in
it
o
newcastle
needs
to
ditch
the
clear
bottles
i
cant
stand
skunked
beer
this
beer
would
probably
be
in
my
top
5
if
theyd
put
it
in
a
brown
bottle
this
is
what
i
like
to
call
a
two
brew
review
two
12
oz
brews
are
being
reviewed
i
do
this
to
give
you
a
honest
opinion
of
this
brew
from
start
to
finish
i
feel
this
brew
would
be
better
on
tap
or
if
it
was
in
brown
bottle
overall
this
beer
functioned
for
us
as
a
night
cap
we
had
enjoyed
dinner
trivia
night
and
some
local
michigan
craft
and
decided
to
stick
around
for
the
show
despite
taking
place
in
the
same
establishment
as
the
first
part
of
our
evening
this
was
the
closest
thing
to
craft
that
we
could
find
and
since
we
hadnt
yet
reviewed
it
we
figured
why
not
having
had
this
beer
many
times
in
the
past
im
not
sure
what
we
were
expecting
to
be
different
this
time
but
for
some
reason
now
we
found
it
to
be
much
less
enjoyable
than
in
the
past
perhaps
we
are
putting
up
our
noses
a
bit
but
nothing
seemed
authentic
about
this
beer
at
all
through
either
the
nose
or
the
mouth
this
is
fine
if
youre
just
shooting
the
breeze
and
dont
really
care
what
youre
drinking
and
likely
much
of
this
will
be
swilled
throughout
the
world
cup
events
but
turn
elsewhere
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
less
commercial
overall
a
bittersweet
2
75
if
this
were
kept
away
from
light
longer
and
not
have
turned
i
would
enjoy
this
brew
i
probably
will
not
buy
this
again
unless
on
tap
o
an
ok
beer
overall
i
really
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
thank
fuck
ive
tried
other
english
brews
because
if
this
is
all
ive
had
to
judge
english
beers
by
id
say
no
thanks
instead
of
buying
this
get
some
samuel
smiths
i
just
tried
their
imperial
stout
and
it
was
pretty
damn
good
if
you
live
in
the
midwest
you
can
find
a
lot
of
sam
smiths
easily
and
they
make
some
great
beers
this
is
probably
the
bud
light
of
english
beers
dont
let
it
skew
your
opinion
england
makes
some
great
beer
sadly
this
isnt
one
of
them
and
its
one
of
the
most
available
over
here
in
the
states
ontap
at
bww
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
mostly
malts
the
taste
is
thin
simple
and
watery
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
one
of
wellknown
brews
that
everyone
carries
that
lacks
real
depth
in
the
taste
department
oflavor
much
better
than
the
aroma
good
brown
ale
as
to
those
with
skunking
issues
check
the
code
3110y
means
the
beer
was
produced
october
31
shelf
life
of
6
months
but
im
drinking
at
7
with
no
issue
if
you
purchase
from
a
reputable
buyer
there
wont
be
an
issue
with
temperature
abuse
dont
purchase6packs
as
the
light
gets
to
them
12
or
24
only
has
a
nice
taste
more
flavor
than
most
other
light
beers
easy
to
drink
and
even
more
delicious
on
tap
it
has
a
tendency
to
get
skunky
in
the
clear
bottles
so
its
hit
or
miss
as
far
as
tasting
it
from
a
bottle
i
highly
recommend
it
on
tap
when
served
in
an
iced
glass
its
delicious
i
would
like
to
see
the
brewery
use
brown
bottles
as
it
keeps
the
light
out
and
will
give
a
truer
taste
than
it
does
in
the
clear
bottles
othis
beer
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
a
craft
brownstyle
ale
but
it
beats
the
crap
out
of
drinking
a
bud
light
the
lightly
skunked
character
did
not
hurt
things
too
much
but
the
husky
malty
flavors
werent
terribly
impressive
either
all
in
all
a
middle
of
the
road
brew
beautiful
and
brown
i
like
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
still
has
a
full
flavor
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
but
it
is
damn
good
great
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
perfect
to
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
winter
day
appropriate
for
all
climates
casual
drinkers
and
alcoholics
both
enjoy
overall
not
outstanding
but
not
bad
either
appearance
is
the
best
looking
part
with
an
obvious
brown
body
and
good
enough
head
that
has
a
bit
of
cascading
to
it
flavor
is
decent
mild
nuttiness
easy
drinking
but
pretty
ordinary
obviously
still
an
ok
selection
overall
i
would
stock
it
there
are
many
beers
around
that
id
pass
up
for
this
one
i
am
not
into
the
ipa
format
i
prefer
stout
but
i
love
how
smooth
this
beer
drinks
a
very
easy
drinking
ale
with
some
light
rather
simple
but
nonetheless
interesting
flavors
that
can
be
a
nice
break
from
the
ultra
hopped
craft
brews
or
the
typical
aal
out
there
this
is
considered
a
simple
working
mans
beer
in
england
as
i
understand
it
probably
fits
that
definition
because
i
think
this
beer
would
quench
thirst
pretty
well
overall
cant
go
wrong
with
newcastle
there
are
plenty
of
brown
ales
but
this
is
definitely
my
go
to
brown
ale
its
not
the
most
sophisticated
but
probably
a
nice
and
simple
beer
to
have
to
knock
back
and
enjoy
great
beer
to
have
any
day
of
the
week
for
any
occasion
cant
go
wrong
o
ive
had
far
worse
but
this
is
very
average
this
does
not
taste
like
an
all
malt
brew
i
think
there
are
adjuncts
in
here
maybe
corn
even
so
i
like
it
a
pretty
clean
yet
flavorful
macro
take
on
a
brown
ale
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
quite
sessionable
a
good
dark
macro
o
i
honestly
thought
i
was
drinking
a
heineken
that
someone
had
colored
brown
this
really
isnt
what
i
expect
from
a
brown
ale
not
say
it
was
bad
just
not
what
i
expected
overall
a
good
beer
and
very
accessible
too
but
by
no
means
a
world
beater
or
even
something
id
regularly
pick
up
httpyoutu
beoz0hssyly70
this
beer
just
reminds
me
of
one
of
my
favorite
gas
station
beers
and
i
can
get
it
in
illinois
unfortunately
the
closest
place
to
get
yuengling
is
ohio
so
this
would
do
in
a
pinch
able
to
put
down
a
few
easily
people
who
might
like
newcastle
are
people
willing
to
try
a
honey
brown
dos
equis
amber
or
perhaps
an
michelob
amberbock
i
had
it
in
oxford
england
while
on
a
business
trip
and
i
have
been
a
fan
ever
since
of
course
it
was
a
little
better
on
tap
in
england
then
it
is
in
a
bottle
in
the
states
it
is
smooth
and
doesnt
have
as
much
carbonation
as
most
brews
i
have
had
in
the
us
i
used
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
when
i
was
younger
but
if
you
close
your
eyes
while
drinking
this
you
will
see
it
is
actually
quite
bland
the
artificial
caramel
color
that
is
added
to
this
beer
does
deceive
your
senses
into
thinking
there
is
more
to
this
beer
than
their
actually
is
so
their
is
something
to
be
said
about
the
eyes
having
the
first
taste
since
i
cut
out
all
artificial
ingredients
in
my
diet
this
beer
will
no
longer
be
in
my
fridge
nor
ordered
while
out
and
i
also
think
its
a
shady
practice
for
a
reputable
brewery
to
be
taking
shortcuts
on
flavor
while
dosing
some
artificial
crap
to
compensate
for
lack
of
quality
i
bought
a
keg
can
5l
of
newcastle
brown
ale
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
it
has
an
iron
taste
initially
and
finishes
with
a
sweet
honey
aftertaste
this
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
and
very
smooth
i
had
a
large
creamy
head
and
it
was
a
nice
amber
brown
color
this
beer
sort
of
reminded
me
of
boddingtons
pub
ale
only
newcastle
brown
is
a
little
darker
overall
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
a
great
beer
for
sipping
or
drinking
all
night
o
a
good
not
great
brew
however
this
beer
is
nicely
drinkable
feels
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
if
only
once
in
a
while
during
summer
months
pours
a
light
brown
clear
with
a
decent
head
of
loose
white
foam
that
fell
pretty
quick
to
a
ring
and
film
on
top
light
little
ruby
blush
nose
is
shy
light
sweet
grain
and
a
fruitiness
bit
of
grass
and
toasted
grain
tatse
is
earhty
with
a
light
sweetness
and
a
very
light
mouthfeel
sweet
grain
thats
drying
in
the
middle
a
little
buttery
and
a
bit
of
fruity
flavor
the
malt
is
very
light
and
not
as
smooth
and
rich
as
some
other
browns
little
bit
of
hop
bitter
to
finish
it
the
mouhtfeel
is
a
bit
slick
and
its
crisp
with
a
bit
of
refreshment
there
is
a
slight
metallic
bit
underneath
as
it
warms
but
by
the
time
you
finish
your
pint
that
is
a
vague
memory
has
a
surprising
bit
of
refreshment
to
offer
really
very
good
and
while
ti
is
not
rich
or
expansive
in
its
malt
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
sessionable
overall
obviously
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
a
nice
classic
to
have
once
in
a
while
since
i
came
to
newcastle
i
wanted
to
taste
this
beer
because
everyone
talks
a
lot
about
it
over
here
in
my
humble
opinion
its
overrated
its
just
a
nice
ale
quite
strong
very
good
looking
bottle
but
not
as
cheap
as
it
should
be
although
the
bottle
is
500ml
drinkability
love
this
beer
my
goto
when
i
do
not
feel
adventurous
always
satisfies
my
desire
to
drink
beer
without
too
much
harshness
but
it
harsh
enough
to
feel
me
full
in
beer
terms
my
favorite
brown
ale
new
castle
brown
ale
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
around
i
dont
know
why
it
gets
poor
scores
and
ratings
nice
nutty
aroma
and
very
well
balanced
ive
started
getting
my
brother
in
law
in
this
beer
and
he
only
drinks
budweiser
although
the
abv
is
low
you
can
still
enjoy
socially
and
not
worry
about
pissing
every
5
minutes
like
most
other
beers
here
in
the
states
although
i
havent
tried
as
many
brews
as
the
majority
of
people
on
here
i
must
say
that
of
all
that
i
have
tried
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
i
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
this
brew
i
only
wish
that
the
other
products
from
the
same
brewery
were
up
to
par
with
this
one
i
felt
compelled
to
revisit
this
beer
since
it
became
available
in
cans
in
the
days
before
good
beer
was
readily
available
in
bars
and
restaurants
in
my
area
newcastle
was
always
my
first
choice
when
out
for
dinnerdrinks
as
it
was
commonly
the
only
nonbmc
brew
available
i
loved
it
on
draft
but
always
hated
the
terrible
clear
bottle
skunk
flavor
when
i
tried
to
buy
it
for
home
i
dont
recall
ever
getting
one
that
didnt
taste
that
way
fastforward
to
2013
poured
from
a
can
it
tastes
just
like
the
draft
newcastle
i
grew
up
on
although
i
now
have
what
some
call
a
snobby
palate
newcastle
is
going
back
in
the
rotation
miller
lite
and
bud
light
has
more
taste
and
cost
less
i
will
taste
other
english
brown
ale
then
compare
it
to
them
in
future
might
be
better
or
worse
pours
as
it
looks
with
an
off
white
head
that
laces
well
aroma
is
light
but
of
yeast
caramel
malt
and
a
slight
sweetness
coupled
with
a
note
of
fruit
the
taste
is
balanced
with
very
little
hop
influence
but
almost
bland
no
complexity
at
all
light
bodied
and
reasonably
carbonated
finishes
cleanly
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
overall
non
offensive
and
innocuous
verging
on
bland
with
not
much
to
particularly
recommend
it
put
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
cooler
and
no
one
will
complain
when
they
get
to
it
pours
light
brown
with
a
little
caramel
colored
foam
that
quickly
breaks
aroma
is
surprising
fruity
not
unpleasant
minimal
malt
and
caramel
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
mild
brown
sugar
and
dry
sweet
malt
hints
of
vinous
fruit
vanilla
notes
tea
minimal
nuts
or
chocolate
people
taste
strong
nuts
in
this
maybe
if
your
taste
buds
have
some
form
of
olympic
level
training
gustatory
illusion
based
on
style
expectations
i
think
watery
tepid
body
and
drinks
more
like
a
lager
than
a
brown
ale
finishes
with
a
fairly
dry
bitter
earthy
note
beer
with
a
lofty
reputation
that
is
not
born
out
in
the
tasting
its
a
smooth
brown
ale
that
does
the
job
when
you
want
a
cold
one
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
brown
ale
beers
or
brown
beers
til
i
had
this
one
then
i
started
to
have
more
i
love
that
its
smooth
and
it
has
a
taste
of
its
own
but
that
should
be
expected
when
it
comes
to
newcastle
overall
it
was
an
average
beer
an
everyday
beer
o
i
dont
like
this
beer
and
i
cant
recommend
it
i
am
always
surprised
and
stunned
at
the
following
this
beer
has
i
have
a
friend
in
l
a
that
only
serves
this
beer
at
his
parties
and
gets
upset
if
you
want
to
bring
your
own
he
will
have
a
server
at
a
taco
bar
but
you
have
to
drink
this
beer
out
of
a
bottle
blah
i
dont
get
it
at
all
solid
ale
with
a
decent
finish
not
the
most
refined
of
ales
the
draught
keg
makes
for
a
decent
if
not
overly
foamy
glass
a
very
good
drinking
beer
honestly
better
than
anything
else
that
you
can
get
for
a
beertender
best
when
served
cold
newcastle
brings
an
old
world
flavor
to
the
new
world
of
beer
i
have
a
personal
love
of
this
beer
but
i
still
think
it
has
relevance
in
the
beer
geek
scene
o
may
not
be
and
wow
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
quite
pleasant
and
something
that
i
would
on
a
regular
basis
my
personal
rating
would
be
around
a
3
8
and
4
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
ruddy
brown
amber
with
a
thin
fine
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
nuts
a
hint
of
sourness
and
whiffs
of
skunkiness
flavor
follows
with
light
caramel
slightly
biscuit
malt
hints
of
toasted
malt
walnuts
slightly
sweet
a
lightly
hoppy
malty
finish
with
faint
skunkiness
light
bodied
a
lightly
but
satisfactorly
flavored
english
brown
that
is
well
suited
for
its
purpose
as
an
entry
level
english
brown
it
is
refreshing
that
calendonian
has
not
succumbed
to
the
fad
of
brown
bottles
that
would
prevent
the
delightful
addition
of
skunk
butt
to
the
beer
over
time
or
not
not
a
bad
light
mealtime
beer
a
good
choice
if
you
stuck
somewhere
with
limited
beer
selection
as
its
quite
well
distributed
and
more
interesting
than
most
mass
produced
beer
buy
the
ones
in
the
dark
cooler
o
frankly
i
love
it
its
not
overwhelmingly
good
but
its
all
i
need
to
get
a
decent
english
brown
ale
fix
the
nose
is
especially
correct
but
the
taste
is
solid
for
9
36
a
sixpack
its
a
decent
enough
buy
when
put
in
context
and
as
solid
a
session
beer
as
ive
found
at
4
7
abv
good
mouthful
not
much
on
the
nose
i
taste
roasted
nuts
and
some
oak
there
is
some
burnt
sugar
as
well
i
was
already
acclimated
to
english
ales
so
this
one
did
not
particularly
stand
out
but
nevertheless
a
good
solid
beer
perfectly
suited
to
the
mass
market
but
better
than
your
typical
mass
market
beer
theres
nothing
impressive
about
this
beer
its
drinkable
and
therefore
its
on
par
with
other
macrobrewery
beers
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
its
offered
to
me
either
o
this
one
is
passable
i
guess
not
something
that
i
would
find
myself
ordering
again
but
its
not
offensive
enough
to
earn
a
stay
away
stamp
just
look
past
this
one
if
there
are
better
options
overall
never
fails
to
unimpress
those
hallmark
northern
brown
qualities
seem
to
be
hidden
under
a
sheet
of
water
needs
to
be
amped
up
a
little
or
a
lot
more
overall
not
bad
but
at
8
99
for
six
this
one
is
an
easy
pass
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
newcastle
brown
will
have
to
revisit
wonder
is
it
is
a
bad
keg
i
remember
this
beer
having
more
to
it
taste
its
just
okay
my
dad
said
that
in
the
70s
he
used
to
drink
this
a
lot
and
it
tasted
a
lot
better
citing
that
they
probably
changed
the
recipe
and
that
the
beer
was
in
brown
bottles
its
light
like
it
ought
to
be
given
the
abv
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
very
good
its
not
bad
thanks
to
the
fact
that
theres
nothing
offputting
and
that
its
not
super
sweet
but
its
pretty
mediocre
o
the
can
is
really
cool
looking
and
if
youre
going
to
a
gathering
where
mcbs
are
the
norm
bbq
sports
beach
hike
crappy
house
party
this
might
make
for
an
interesting
but
safe
change
of
pace
honestly
it
seems
like
people
will
just
be
happy
to
hold
this
new
almostpint
can
and
look
differentslightly
more
tasteful
than
the
innumerable
mcb
canwielders
aside
from
its
exterior
looks
you
could
do
some
hand
waving
and
say
that
this
tastes
better
out
of
a
can
than
the
bottle
the
bottom
line
is
that
theres
a
lot
to
be
desired
no
coffee
no
cocoa
no
toasted
flavor
poppycock
the
verdict
not
bad
watery
unexciting
but
ultimately
drinkable
thats
about
it
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
impression
this
is
the
quad
to
end
all
quads
an
immediate
dark
fruit
punch
in
the
mouth
with
slowly
developing
dark
malt
and
yeast
character
that
somehow
manages
to
stay
medium
bodied
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
although
it
is
very
similar
in
taste
to
most
well
made
quads
its
nimble
body
and
drying
finish
take
the
westy
xii
to
another
level
this
is
a
malt
bomb
that
is
amazingly
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
almost
like
a
light
beer
no
real
toastiness
or
nuttiness
that
goes
along
with
the
beautiful
style
of
beer
that
is
an
english
brown
very
bland
taste
that
didnt
improve
at
all
as
the
beer
warmed
the
watery
taste
gave
way
to
a
faint
graininess
that
faded
away
into
a
hop
bitterness
that
just
didnt
compliment
the
thin
beer
at
all
this
is
a
pathetic
excuse
for
the
style
avoid
this
brew
go
with
a
samuel
smiths
or
a
boneshaker
instead
kind
of
a
hard
beer
to
review
its
pleasant
and
by
no
means
undrinkable
its
sort
of
eccentric
too
in
its
nose
and
flavor
profile
still
i
cant
imagine
scenarios
where
id
be
trying
this
again
probably
worth
trying
once
and
deciding
for
yourself
i
find
it
genuinely
odd
that
such
a
mild
eccentric
little
beer
became
the
favored
brand
of
working
class
toughs
but
history
is
filled
with
such
oddities
o
its
good
but
not
great
it
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
beers
you
will
find
in
most
grocery
stores
overall
35
the
off
flavors
and
bitterness
would
be
much
better
replaced
with
true
hop
flavor
but
until
then
its
not
a
bad
choice
at
an
outdoor
barbecue
or
when
the
alternative
is
euro
lager
green
or
keg
beer
o
i
think
this
beer
would
be
much
better
and
might
be
at
least
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
light
struck
but
as
it
is
its
swill
just
a
horrible
misfire
on
nearly
every
level
with
no
redeeming
qualities
terrible
the
foam
is
lower
retention
but
i
has
a
good
marron
color
so
thats
fine
the
smell
is
more
roasty
and
barely
sweet
the
taste
is
well
balanced
between
roast
and
caramel
malts
and
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
i
find
it
quite
splendid
and
it
works
for
me
on
a
hot
day
cheers
overall
ive
always
liked
this
beer
and
im
liking
it
now
while
reviewing
it
its
just
so
easy
to
put
these
down
better
than
light
lagers
becuase
this
is
a
really
flavorful
light
bodied
beer
if
i
need
a
beer
to
bring
to
an
outing
that
i
can
drink
all
night
with
no
problem
whatsoever
with
flavor
itll
be
this
overall
this
is
just
an
average
brown
ale
but
better
than
other
macros
it
is
just
slightly
above
average
for
a
beer
newcastle
is
a
name
synonymous
with
the
brown
ale
style
this
should
be
attributed
to
the
brands
history
and
no
other
reason
presently
its
a
brown
ale
with
a
lagers
outlook
on
life
the
brewerys
aim
is
no
longer
to
produce
the
best
most
flavourful
brown
ale
but
rather
to
market
a
darkish
beer
that
is
still
insipid
enough
to
have
massmarket
appeal
oh
how
the
mighty
have
fallen
i
remember
this
beer
20
or
so
years
ago
when
you
could
only
get
it
in
pint
bottles
it
tastes
nothing
like
it
once
did
there
is
a
rather
odd
aroma
that
smells
like
dirty
socks
flavor
wise
it
reminds
me
of
bad
home
brew
it
tastes
like
its
brewed
with
a
lot
of
cane
sugar
dry
cidery
like
finish
thats
just
awful
overall
this
is
just
an
average
brown
ale
it
is
not
impressive
in
any
way
overall
an
agreeable
english
brown
ale
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
but
this
one
is
good
for
what
it
is
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
the
aromas
however
the
taste
improved
my
overall
thoughts
of
this
beer
overallwow
i
used
to
love
this
beer
revisiting
now
is
kind
of
eye
opening
my
palate
has
came
a
long
way
this
beer
isnt
horrible
but
its
not
anything
other
than
beer
to
drink
to
get
drunk
the
flavor
is
better
than
most
lagers
but
compared
to
other
brown
ales
it
is
falling
very
far
behind
lots
of
other
fish
in
the
sea

poured

oz

poured

clear
mediumlight

with
almost
no
head
and
even
less
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
malty
with
what
i
thought
smelled
like
caramel
but
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
it
the
taste
is
about
the
same
not
much
distinctive
or
notable
about
it
oddly
enough
it
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
but
theres
not
much
to
it
either
i
bought
this
at
my
local
liquor
store
for
3
39
tax
18
6
oz
i
heard
about
this
beer
so
i
decided
to
try
it
to
be
honest
i
feel
a
little
disappointed
it
had
a
very
classic
average
taste
to
it
nothing
really
impressive
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
good
enough
to
be
my
first
option
food
match
a
nice
hot
vindaloo
curry
will
completely
overpower
the
flavour
of
this
brew
which
isnt
such
a
bad
thing
always
buy
the
12
pack
of
bottles
or
the
cans
because
the
packaging
shields
the
beer
from
the
harmful
rays
if
you
buy
the
6
packs
there
is
more
surface
area
exposed
to
the
light
which
will
skunk
the
beer
faster
i
really
do
like
the
brown
color
to
this
beer
a
burnt
caramel
is
what
i
would
call
it
the
smell
was
mostly
a
muted
mix
of
the
normal
barley
and
malts
but
at
least
it
wasnt
overpowering
the
beer
can
pour
a
tall
head
if
your
not
careful
and
has
you
would
think
it
had
little
staying
power
surprisingly
the
lacing
was
very
evident
and
stuck
all
the
way
down
the
glass
mouthfeel
was
like
most
others
a
high
level
of
carbonation
evident
the
moment
it
hits
your
tongue
what
really
stands
out
is
the
smooth
taste
of
the
dark
ale
it
was
very
very
drinkable
that
just
stands
out
to
me
overall
i
really
do
like
this
beer
strong
taste
little
after
affect
and
was
simply
happy
to
be
reunited
reliable
british
beer
specially
considering
they
produce
it
in
large
scale
to
drink
a
few
on
a
hot
or
cold
day
its
alright
i
think
its
pretty
mediocre
for
a
brown
ale
i
prefer
new
glarus
fat
squirrel
over
it
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
wartime
ration
recipe
they
have
here
still
you
can
make
a
flavorful
and
rich
complex
enough
brew
from
not
much
and
theyre
clearly
pandering
to
a
lowestcommon
denominator
audience
ive
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
a
few
times
over
the
past
year
showing
slightly
more
character
and
malt
dimension
and
i
could
only
wonder
if
this
bar
hadnt
cleaned
there
lines
in
awhile
you
never
know
i
like
this
i
bought
it
on
a
bet
my
buddy
swears
by
the
brown
thought
id
dislike
it
but
after
a
year
or
so
of
trying
to
decide
this
has
become
a
goto
when
iam
in
the
mood
for
something
with
a
little
meat
on
its
bones
not
the
best
option
as
far
on
the
darkside
much
more
of
a
dunkel
fan
but
there
is
something
to
be
said
about
how
easy
drinking
this
beer
is
its
endearing
mix
of
malts
and
grains
its
almost
perfect
amount
of
carb
for
the
style
the
classic
can
overall
id
say
if
you
like
the
darkside
give
this
one
a
sip
you
probably
wont
be
dissapointed
pairs
nicely
with
a
roast
as
iam
about
to
enjoy
thanks
to
my
beautiful
wife
overall
an
alight
more
sessionable
brown
ale
o
great
daytime
beer
a
little
short
of
substance
if
you
were
to
only
have
one
but
if
you
have
two
it
hits
the
spot
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
astounding
but
i
liked
it
didnt
have
to
worry
about
the
skunking
from
the
clear
bottles
cause
i
bought
it
in
a
can
it
was
better
than
average
but
didnt
really
provide
a
unique
experience
i
might
buy
it
again
and
could
see
it
being
extremely
sessionable
if
thats
your
game
plan
o
surprisingly
average
for
whatever
reason
i
was
expecting
worse
but
it
turned
out
to
be
drinkable
and
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
just
lacks
a
little
bit
o
before
the
craft
beer
wave
this
was
one
of
my
treasured
brews
theres
the
nostalgia
factor
going
on
for
me
otherwise
its
a
waste
of
time
overall
theres
just
no
flavor
in
this
in
fact
id
even
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
natty
light
has
more
flavor
than
this
if
you
want
a
good
brown
ale
dont
drink
this
look
elsewhere
love
the
color
and
how
it
pours
into
a
glass
since
i
drink
mainly
dark
beers
and
ale
i
want
a
good
hops
taste
and
this
ale
does
not
disappoint
i
keep
one
or
two
on
hand
when
i
want
something
stout
and
since
i
drink
less
than
a
beer
a
week
i
want
it
to
be
special
when
i
open
it
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
thanks
england
for
inventing
the
style
and
shipping
me
this
brew
via
white
plains
ny
nothing
too
complex
going
here
basic
stuff
skipper
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
amber
color
with
a
short
offwhite
head
plum
and
tart
dark
fruit
nose
if
you
didnt
tell
me
what
this
beer
was
and
simply
put
it
under
my
nose
id
tell
you
it
was
british
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
wet
with
a
little
carbonation
toward
the
finish
midway
between
tart
and
sweet
dark
fruit
flavor
a
little
roasted
malt
to
help
cut
the
fruitiness
not
a
bad
swiller
sweet
barley
malts
up
front
bready
candylike
caramel
slight
roasted
ripe
cherries
hop
bitterness
is
mild
towards
the
finish
body
is
medium
very
refreshing
a
little
dryness
in
the
palate
soft
carbonation
o
this
beer
is
not
really
anything
special
and
i
certainly
have
no
burning
desire
to
run
out
and
get
more
of
these
that
being
said
this
beer
is
actually
quite
easy
to
drink
and
is
sessionable
this
was
one
of
the
early
british
beers
that
i
experimented
with
in
the
early
1990s
when
i
was
first
getting
into
craft
beer
and
i
have
a
great
keychain
bottle
opener
that
i
have
been
using
since
then
kind
of
a
nostalgic
brew
for
me
o
decent
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
just
a
step
above
most
american
macrobrews
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
a
little
lacking
in
character
the
odd
thing
is
this
beer
tastes
a
little
like
a
german
lager
seriously
it
looks
and
tastes
like
shiner
bock
weird
o
imo
a
bit
off
style
but
still
a
very
good
beer
to
enjoy
during
a
session
newcastle
brown
ale
beer
is
a
cult
classic
in
our
college
town
when
i
ask
my
lady
to
pickup
some
brown
ale
this
seems
to
be
her
throwback
to
make
us
both
happy
on
flavor
and
price
this
beer
is
best
served
cold
into
a
pint
glass
for
a
mild
pleasant
maltiness
although
somewhat
thin
and
empty
still
easily
drinkable
when
fresh
o
easy
drinking
light
yet
has
good
flavor
has
what
all
ale
should
have
but
in
a
light
presentation
which
lends
itself
to
session
drinking
i
find
it
quite
pleasant
because
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
mulitiple
glasses
without
feeling
bloated
in
spite
of
the
sweetness
this
beer
has
a
place
in
my
rotation
of
ales
o
a
very
popularized
industralized
brown
ale
with
a
large
cult
classic
style
following
does
not
possess
the
typical
brown
ale
qualities
that
i
enjoy
malty
and
toasty
as
it
warms
it
seems
as
if
im
sipping
on
a
black
tea
overall
impression
it
tastes
almost
as
good
at
room
temperature
as
it
does
when
chilled
this
has
an
intense
ruby
cola
color
with
a
nice
cap
of
foam
theres
a
light
somewhat
malty
aroma
to
it
thats
not
overpowering
but
just
enough
to
make
its
presence
known
the
flavor
has
a
mild
roast
and
a
mild
sweetness
followed
by
a
clean
finish
overall
its
an
innocuous
and
harmless
as
can
be
overall
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
only
because
it
resembles
thick
water
would
be
good
with
a
really
flavorful
pizza
though
since
it
would
still
taste
like
pizza
as
you
drink
it
then
again
this
is
where
they
had
it
on
tap
the
pizza
place
there
are
better
beers
for
the
money
some
people
try
and
over
complicate
things
abv
ibus
lacing
hops
please
dont
try
this
with
this
beer
just
drink
it
accept
it
for
a
1920s
beer
and
enjoy
and
sit
back
and
think
how
much
life
is
better
with
beer
in
your
life
the
beer
pours
from
the
keg
a
candy
caramel
brown
much
like
maple
syrup
the
head
is
big
and
smooth
with
a
couple
of
craters
and
sticky
styrofoamlike
lacing
though
it
mellows
out
into
islands
of
foam
the
beer
smells
cloying
with
sweet
malts
that
have
a
tinge
of
sour
in
them
and
slightly
skunked
smell
the
beers
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
only
less
cloying
caramel
malts
and
biscuity
malt
are
present
in
the
taste
and
there
is
a
slight
roasted
flavor
also
present
bitters
are
slight
an
nearly
not
present
except
in
the
aftertaste
where
there
is
a
slight
medicinal
play
in
among
the
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
slightly
harsh
with
carbonation
in
the
initial
sip
but
mellows
into
a
thick
and
slightly
chewy
feel
that
is
quite
pleasant
though
has
a
slightly
watery
feel
and
it
does
leave
a
slight
sticky
feel
in
the
mouth
overall
this
beer
is
a
nice
english
brown
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
but
overall
its
worth
a
taste
o
this
is
a
nice
light
for
style
beer
very
drinkable
ive
had
it
in
bottle
too
and
picked
up
the
same
metalic
smell
and
taste
must
be
me
because
i
dont
see
others
mention
it
o
a
simple
beer
in
the
best
way
possible
as
a
darker
beer
thats
lower
in
alcohol
content
than
a
lot
of
its
relatives
its
great
for
having
if
you
want
more
than
just
a
couple
nothing
crazy
but
a
step
above
most
and
a
good
everyday
beer
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
slightly
watery
finish
effervescence
is
medium
i
used
to
drink
this
by
the
case
well
buy
it
that
way
at
least
now
im
wondering
why
i
loved
it
so
much
never
really
noticed
the
metal
note
then
this
is
much
better
on
tap
the
difference
is
so
pronounced
more
so
than
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
another
goto
beer
not
a
superstar
but
always
pleasant
what
a
boring
beer
how
did
newcastle
end
up
getting
this
beer
into
virtually
every
bar
in
america
its
not
that
good
its
a
beer
that
someone
with
no
knowledge
of
beer
would
drink
when
heshes
in
the
mood
for
a
premium
beer
its
a
little
watery
for
starters
and
then
doesnt
really
boast
any
of
the
nice
nutty
profiles
the
style
is
appreciated
for
oh
well
nothing
i
can
do
about
it
pours
a
medium
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
shows
little
retention
smells
of
light
brown
sugar
fruity
esters
a
hint
of
butter
and
a
bit
of
mineral
water
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
caramel
light
brown
sugar
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
diacytyl
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
bubbles
and
a
sweet
crisp
mouthfeel
i
used
to
drink
these
a
lot
when
i
was
first
getting
into
craft
beer
but
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
one
decent
brown
ale
but
really
could
use
a
bit
more
chocolate
or
caramel
to
back
it
up
newcastle
is
not
an
astringently
hoppy
double
ipa
nor
a
viscous
russian
imperial
stout
it
is
subtle
british
brew
its
strength
found
its
simplicity
o
great
beer
for
the
price
out
of
all
the
mass
marketed
beers
out
there
i
consider
this
to
be
my
go
to
o
i
can
see
why
people
like
it
but
it
is
not
for
me
too
much
hop
bite
and
not
enough
bready
flavors
poured
from
an
18
oz
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
finger
worth
of
head
leaves
decent
amounts
of
lacing
smells
of
faint
caramell
malts
and
some
slight
corn
grains
the
taste
is
of
tons
of
caramel
malts
with
some
ripe
apple
in
the
background
some
slight
grains
and
even
slighter
adjunct
tastes
better
than
how
i
describe
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
although
it
opens
up
no
new
flavors
overall
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
definitely
buy
this
stuff
again
as
kegs
for
a
party
o
perfect
party
beer
or
pretransition
for
macrolager
drinkers
not
offensive
and
a
great
substitute
for
that
swill
you
were
going
to
pick
up
at
the
gas
station
for
the
party
use
this
to
ween
hardnosed
people
into
the
world
of
craft
overall
this
is
the
epitome
of
bad
brown
ales
nearly
flavorless
with
almost
no
body
to
speak
of
im
baffled
by
the
popularity
of
this
beer
it
does
have
more
of
a
tea
than
malt
feeling
but
i
like
it
im
new
to
beerdrinking
so
i
dont
know
fancy
terminology
to
describe
it
the
bottle
looks
great
to
me
its
bright
and
fun
packaging
makes
you
want
to
drink
which
is
important
to
me
in
choosing
a
beer
even
though
i
drank
from
a
bottle
ive
seen
the
way
it
pours
and
the
head
doesnt
last
for
very
long
it
dissipates
about
1
minute
and
a
half
after
its
poured
so
youre
better
off
having
it
from
the
bottle
the
smell
was
like
a
dull
yuengling
which
i
love
how
yuengling
smells
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
the
taste
was
very
bland
and
bitter
almost
a
little
too
robust
like
drinking
extremely
strong
tea
without
sweetner
yes
im
a
southerner
and
the
mouth
feel
was
a
little
too
bubbly
to
me
i
like
a
dull
carbonated
feeling
if
youre
more
about
hops
and
robustness
then
this
is
your
beer
but
if
you
look
for
more
of
a
wellrounded
flavor
that
expands
when
its
in
your
mouth
this
is
not
for
you
the
appearance
was
rather
rusty
but
very
good
body
and
a
nice
bubble
top
the
first
whiff
was
a
bit
oddbut
it
improved
the
longer
it
sat
it
has
a
good
fruity
malty
odor
and
taste
and
robust
finish
that
didnt
leave
me
thirstyvery
satisfying
i
would
recommned
this
beer
for
anything
heavy
enough
for
a
good
jolt
an
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
great
beer
odi
enjoy
this
beer
from
time
to
time
an
oldiebutgoodie
easy
to
drink
great
feel
salud
regardless
its
still
an
easy
drinking
and
tasty
simple
brew
it
wouldnt
be
one
id
turn
down
and
could
easily
choose
over
many
others
its
all
there
for
style
and
an
easy
drinking
example
o
this
beer
is
not
good
im
not
sure
its
because
of
the
long
trip
from
england
in
clear
bottles
but
theres
a
ton
of
skunk
in
this
it
looks
very
nice
and
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
the
aroma
and
taste
leave
much
more
to
be
desired
i
hope
this
isnt
what
most
people
think
of
when
they
hear
brown
ale
a
friend
of
mine
had
me
try
this
its
one
of
his
favorite
beers
and
i
trusted
him
up
until
this
point
i
took
the
first
sip
out
of
a
bottle
and
i
hated
it
i
asked
him
if
they
had
been
sitting
in
his
car
for
the
last
few
months
because
it
tasted
like
the
worst
skunk
beer
you
could
possibly
drink
and
too
my
surprise
he
said
that
was
exactly
how
it
was
supposed
to
taste
i
cant
get
down
with
a
beer
thats
supposed
to
taste
skunked
o
better
than
the
bottle
version
but
thats
not
saying
much
stout
overall
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
went
well
with
a
meal
mushroom
meatballs
ive
had
this
many
times
over
the
years
but
there
has
always
been
something
off
when
i
drank
it
all
those
other
times
skunky
metallic
etc
this
time
i
suspect
it
was
fresh
enough
to
properly
convey
the
flavor
of
this
beer
overall
just
above
average
not
deep
in
flavor
not
complex
but
a
good
steady
beer
drinkability
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
but
its
not
too
bad
and
it
got
me
pleasantly
buzzed
even
accompanying
a
ribeye
and
potatoes
the
flavour
is
manageable
in
that
it
at
least
has
one
oi
had
low
expectations
for
this
beer
based
on
others
reviews
and
while
better
than
i
had
anticipated
was
still
left
hoping
for
more
to
me
browns
should
be
robust
and
packed
with
malted
flavor
this
was
just
not
present
here
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
like
bitterness
of
a
dark
beer
but
dont
mind
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
well
feels
like
a
well
deserved
treat
that
should
be
earned
rather
than
bought
definitively
choose
tap
over
bottle
feels
like
every
bottle
ive
had
tends
to
leave
the
taste
of
the
cap
in
my
mouth
nevertheless
a
great
beer
it
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
so
the
colour
is
no
surprise
the
body
is
clear
and
on
the
yellow
side
of
brown
there
is
a
good
amount
of
head
maybe
two
fingers
which
is
beige
to
brown
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
malt
i
smell
mostly
cereal
grains
and
bread
maybe
a
hint
of
peanut
butter
the
taste
is
light
and
not
complex
at
all
to
me
it
tastes
like
caramel
and
ash
it
definitely
has
a
buttery
taste
that
seems
to
coat
the
tongue
which
is
probably
responsible
for
making
it
taste
light
there
is
a
hops
sensation
in
the
aftertaste
i
find
it
has
a
medium
body
and
appropriate
carbonation
overall
im
somewhat
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
taste
a
brown
ale
could
accomplish
much
more
actually
it
reminds
me
of
a
lager
with
a
little
more
of
a
dull
taste
this
is
one
of
those
beer
mysteries
to
me
how
this
product
became
world
renowned
is
absurd
its
average
at
best
lacking
a
lot
of
flavor
and
being
unsatisfactory
in
many
ways
it
pours
the
same
as
it
looks
in
the
clear
bottle
thin
and
light
brown
with
a
small
off
white
head
smells
like
english
malts
and
caramel
malts
but
nothing
assertive
just
kind
of
smells
like
a
beer
flavor
is
similarly
bland
i
much
prefer
robust
brown
ales
and
this
just
isnt
it
some
sweeter
malt
flavor
up
front
and
a
metallic
taste
on
the
back
end
not
real
nice
mouthfeel
is
fine
fair
carbonation
and
a
drinkably
medium
body
overall
though
this
beer
is
a
constant
let
down
more
flavor
more
body
and
more
life
are
all
necessary
here
pass
this
one
up
if
you
can
adecent
ale
not
the
best
youll
find
at
an
off
license
in
englandbut
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
o
i
thought
this
stuff
was
alright
a
few
years
ago
before
i
discovered
proper
beer
o
i
bet
it
can
be
better
its
an
imported
beer
so
i
dont
know
how
old
it
is
but
it
is
a
bit
weird
i
would
have
to
try
a
fresh
one
overall
a
good
brown
ale
for
its
price
its
not
the
best
brown
ale
ever
but
its
still
really
good
o
i
understand
the
poor
reviews
from
clear
glass
bottles
from
a
can
this
is
pretty
good
a
nice
english
brown
that
should
be
rated
higher
than
it
is
imo
when
it
comes
to
this
beer
its
all
about
finding
a
good
six
pack
or
12
pack
if
you
get
a
new
six
or
12
pack
that
just
got
put
on
the
shelf
you
are
in
luck
i
loved
this
beer
the
smell
can
be
skunky
the
taste
is
nutty
and
kinda
of
caramel
like
honestly
i
dont
know
why
i
like
this
beer
so
much
its
an
easy
beer
to
get
drunk
off
of
and
its
also
a
good
beer
just
to
have
a
few
of
i
rated
it
pretty
eye
for
my
opinion
i
think
people
should
at
least
try
this
overall
not
bad
a
little
less
flavored
than
most
brown
ales
ive
tried
but
its
an
enjoyable
beer
notes
why
do
any
brewers
use
clear
glass
bottles
beer
sucks
in
clear
glass
unless
you
buy
an
unopened
case
this
could
have
been
a
good
beer
o
definitely
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
was
definitely
quaffable
probably
a
decent
option
at
most
bmc
bars
if
you
can
find
it
but
there
are
lots
of
better
browns
pours
a
nice
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
does
not
last
too
long
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
and
nuts
taste
is
prominantly
nutty
with
a
minimal
bitter
finish
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
overall
not
a
bad
brew
and
just
average
brown
ale
i
poured
from
bottle
to
glass
the
head
was
thin
finger
thick
and
light
tan
in
color
it
disappeared
rather
quick
but
left
some
lacing
the
color
was
of
a
tea
amber
mainly
the
aroma
had
a
metallic
note
with
faint
malt
and
no
describable
hop
notes
the
taste
was
mainly
of
the
metallic
note
described
in
the
aroma
that
faded
to
a
bready
malt
aftertaste
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
with
little
residual
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
the
low
marks
may
have
been
due
to
age
as
the
stuff
probably
doesnt
fly
off
the
shelves
here
quite
as
a
fast
as
other
specialty
brews
overall
im
given
the
impression
that
this
is
the
uk
version
of
a
budweiser
or
other
mass
produced
brew
o
just
as
tasty
as
i
remember
it
from
years
ago
when
we
first
discovered
it
in
england
very
sessionable
smooth
poured
from
bottle
to
newcastle
glass
the
beer
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
color
translucent
with
a
small
12
finger
cap
some
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
muted
but
consists
of
a
distinct
caramel
malty
sweetness
small
earthen
hops
and
a
nutty
character
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
volume
as
its
not
bad
just
mild
in
nature
similar
the
nose
the
beer
starts
and
ends
with
the
thick
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
a
light
but
noticeable
earthy
hop
and
mild
bitterness
the
nutty
character
provides
a
gentle
yet
fulfilling
and
balances
everything
out
well
finishes
a
bit
watery
and
thin
but
crisp
and
clean
lighter
bodied
overall
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
a
newcastle
this
was
more
enjoyable
than
i
remembered
the
malty
sweetness
hit
the
spot
this
is
too
sweet
sometimes
also
this
doesnt
strike
me
at
all
as
what
i
think
of
as
a
brown
ale
to
give
color
to
taste
golden
but
it
has
a
certain
crispness
something
weird
about
this
one
it
used
to
taste
skunked
every
time
i
had
it
until
i
had
it
on
tap
since
then
have
never
had
a
skunky
one
maybe
its
a
coincidence
when
i
dont
want
to
think
too
much
before
grabbing
something
i
know
this
will
be
fine
enough
of
a
distinctive
taste
worth
coming
back
too
if
you
like
it
a
little
sweeter
o
a
great
brew
the
flavours
texture
and
aromas
are
very
balanced
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
any
time
of
the
day
doa
oa
year
ago
i
thought
this
was
really
good
but
after
a
year
of
trying
many
other
beers
i
found
out
there
are
a
lot
of
others
out
there
that
are
much
better
but
this
should
make
a
excellent
crossover
beer
not
much
to
hate
but
not
much
to
love
either
somewhat
drinkable
but
overall
im
not
very
impressed
o
used
to
really
enjoy
this
back
in
the
day
but
after
not
drinking
it
in
some
time
it
doesnt
seem
as
good
as
i
recall
bottles
were
probably
skunked
which
does
not
help
but
would
try
again
sometime
in
the
future
raul
does
not
agree
i
have
never
gotten
into
this
one
the
clear
bottle
pours
a
medium
colored
brownish
red
with
a
lightly
cream
colored
head
this
always
gives
a
bit
of
a
tequila
smell
from
it
with
some
hazelnut
and
a
bit
of
tofee
malt
flavor
follows
suit
and
for
some
reason
i
get
a
tequila
flavor
from
this
i
do
not
like
tequila
a
watered
down
brown
ale
that
seems
to
almost
have
a
tequila
aftertaste
color
is
faint
not
a
win
in
my
book
this
beer
was
a
tasty
one
in
my
book
i
like
that
you
already
know
the
color
beer
it
is
by
the
clear
bottle
it
is
displayed
in
the
color
is
a
reddish
browbeat
with
a
light
head
the
taste
is
a
good
roast
with
a
bitter
ale
taste
at
the
end
the
overall
look
and
taste
of
this
beer
was
pretty
good
o
not
that
bad
for
a
macro
but
not
a
very
good
brown
ale
overall
either
doubtful
ill
try
this
again
o
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
didnt
know
it
was
as
abundant
as
it
is
i
was
quite
impressed
it
didnt
have
any
power
behind
it
but
it
certainly
was
very
flavorful
with
not
poor
aftertastes
still
one
of
my
favorites
i
really
like
this
beer
it
may
not
be
exceptional
but
every
time
i
drink
it
i
always
want
one
more
drinkability
nice
and
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
ale
but
decent
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
as
it
was
the
one
to
introduce
my
teen
self
to
ales
this
beer
tastes
like
nothing
to
me
i
really
want
to
like
it
because
its
a
beautiful
color
and
nicely
presented
and
widely
available
but
every
time
i
have
it
i
wind
up
sucking
it
down
really
fast
because
i
keep
straining
to
extract
some
flavor
from
it
i
wonder
if
the
clear
glass
bottle
means
that
whatever
flavor
it
has
is
zapped
out
by
the
time
it
gets
to
me
its
a
waste
and
a
shame
overall
a
decent
brew
nothing
to
get
bent
out
of
shape
about
but
not
a
bad
brew
either
a
good
ale
if
you
dont
have
anything
else
on
hand
i
dont
know
if
i
would
specifically
seek
it
out
to
buy
it
but
not
bad
slight
hint
of
hoppy
aromas
and
more
than
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
some
of
that
european
cat
pee
aroma
its
pretty
beery
in
a
nice
way
but
that
dirty
mushroomy
taste
is
not
to
my
liking
more
of
a
lager
than
an
english
brown
newcastle
is
hit
and
miss
for
me
sometimes
it
tastes
pretty
good
other
times
its
a
bit
much
but
once
in
awhile
is
ok
with
me
o
ok
not
great
and
for
me
its
a
roll
of
the
dice
as
to
whether
im
going
to
be
disappointed
ok
if
its
the
best
option
at
a
bar
with
burgers
on
a
hot
day
etc
but
i
probably
wont
buy
on
a
whim
anymore
if
youre
getting
someone
going
on
better
beer
thats
in
your
neighborhood
grocery
store
there
are
lots
of
better
options
i
read
somewhere
that
theyve
been
making
this
beer
since
1927
youd
think
that
in
all
that
time
theyd
figure
out
that
putting
beer
in
clear
glass
bottles
is
a
recipe
for
disaster
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
someday
unless
it
comes
in
clear
glass
kegs
which
wouldnt
shock
me
but
i
will
never
ever
drink
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
again
as
long
as
they
sell
it
in
clear
glass
it
smells
like
pepe
le
pughs
arse
its
a
shame
since
the
flavor
might
really
be
good
hmmm
perhaps
this
is
how
the
english
get
back
at
us
for
winning
our
independence
d
im
glad
i
had
this
in
tap
but
its
far
from
memorable
overall
an
average
beer
would
be
a
lot
better
if
the
bottles
werent
clear
newcastle
brown
ale
from
the
caledonian
brewery
company
limited
is
an
english
brown
ale
that
is
unremarkable
in
every
aspect
the
one
and
only
what
a
brown
beer
that
taste
like
an
insipid
american
domestic
lager
people
who
pay
a
premium
for
this
import
and
expect
something
special
are
in
for
a
big
letdown
if
it
wants
to
be
more
roasty
it
should
have
a
much
more
subdued
sweetness
and
where
in
all
this
are
the
earthy
tones
of
some
english
hops
to
make
it
english
it
tastes
like
a
malty
corona
it
is
probably
worth
the
price
if
you
can
get
it
cheap
but
nothing
id
be
dying
to
get
this
one
hasnt
aged
well
either
i
have
broadened
my
experience
of
brown
ales
and
discovered
other
better
examples
or
their
quality
and
thence
flavor
have
suffered
this
beer
should
not
be
considered
craft
but
i
guess
to
the
masses
it
is
i
had
this
at
a
hockey
game
this
was
the
best
of
the
worst
it
poured
a
dark
red
with
brown
highlights
head
was
1
finger
that
vanished
quickly
the
smell
is
of
light
roasted
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
a
ho
presence
taste
is
like
malt
flavored
water
i
do
not
pick
up
chocolate
caramel
or
any
other
flavor
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
mild
carbonation
and
it
leaves
a
metallic
tinge
in
the
mouth
overall
it
is
better
than
bmc
but
not
worth
drinking
a
delicious
beer
to
help
wash
away
the
semester
as
i
sit
here
having
just
turned
in
final
grades
o
this
beer
tastes
soo
much
better
on
tap
than
from
a
bottle
it
is
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
i
think
the
beer
gets
skunked
in
the
bottle
due
to
it
being
clear
what
are
they
thinking
overall
this
isnt
exciting
or
good
o
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
a
brown
ale
even
if
it
is
a
little
underwhelming
example
thereof
this
is
bottled
in
clear
glass
and
with
such
a
low
abv
there
is
always
a
risk
of
the
beer
having
gone
bad
but
for
an
occasional
beer
i
consider
it
worth
the
risk
overall
it
is
a
decent
liquor
store
beer
by
liquor
store
beer
i
mean
beer
that
is
sold
at
liquor
stores
ha
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
but
can
definatly
smell
a
hint
of
caramel
more
crisp
then
it
is
flavorful
very
easy
to
drink
beer
a
defenite
must
try
for
the
beginners
like
me
would
buy
again
o
i
used
to
really
love
this
one
but
something
has
changed
and
i
seem
to
be
drawn
away
from
this
just
decent
for
its
style
and
decent
to
me
overall
this
was
better
than
i
expected
i
chose
to
purchase
a
sixer
of
cans
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
tasted
fresh
clean
and
very
much
in
the
vein
of
a
marzen
with
malty
and
caramel
overtones
very
pleasant
o
for
such
a
massproduced
beer
this
really
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
ive
had
it
before
and
im
sure
ill
have
it
again
o
not
bad
not
great
can
get
it
pretty
cheap
at
my
local
pub
but
usually
dont
overall
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
one
of
the
beers
that
first
turned
me
onto
microcraft
beers
very
drinkable
o
an
okay
beer
that
seems
to
not
quite
have
what
i
want
not
enough
flavor
and
the
sweetness
in
it
seems
unbalanced
but
it
is
better
than
a
bud
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
away
from
bmc
and
expanded
my
beer
horizons
so
it
always
has
a
place
in
my
heart
it
might
not
be
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
all
around
final
thoughts
if
you
can
get
past
the
smell
this
has
a
nice
malty
bill
but
then
again
im
sure
quite
a
few
would
love
to
huff
this
smell
o
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
great
general
purpose
brew
food
goes
well
with
it
not
to
hoppy
for
hot
day
just
overall
nice
food
pairing
this
would
be
good
with
a
burger
or
even
meat
loaf
with
some
mashed
potatoes
o
seen
this
on
the
shelves
forever
and
finally
got
around
to
trying
it
it
is
not
worth
the
10
sixer
asking
price
but
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
remotely
special
oan
average
brown
ale
that
is
a
little
thin
in
weight
and
flavor
overall
in
addition
to
the
regular
bottles
ive
now
had
this
from
a
minikeg
and
from
a
fresh
bottle
from
the
uk
these
latter
two
versions
are
slightly
better
but
not
by
much
im
thinking
that
this
just
may
not
be
that
good
of
a
beer
theres
a
difference
between
balance
and
boring
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
very
thinwatery
taste
not
much
on
the
nose
either
its
okay
and
doesnt
taste
bad
just
a
bit
watery
had
it
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
doesnt
seem
to
travel
well
not
too
sure
this
comes
from
a
great
water
sourse
so
that
might
be
a
factor
its
pretty
much
meh
for
me
o
i
like
my
brown
ales
thicker
and
nuttier
but
i
will
not
frown
when
my
brother
hands
me
one
o
i
find
it
enjoyable
it
may
not
be
the
sexiest
pick
but
you
cant
argue
with
a
classic
this
is
a
nice
beer
cheers
mike
o
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
and
i
have
in
the
past
this
is
the
beer
that
made
me
realize
there
was
more
to
drinking
beer
than
bonging
and
slamming
milwaukees
best
beer
is
also
meant
to
be
appreciated
and
really
enjoyed
and
i
still
really
enjoy
this
one
short
to
medium
length
decently
consistent
aftertaste
o
not
bad
definitlely
would
have
on
tap
again
although
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
stronger
o
this
is
a
simple
brown
ale
not
much
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
good
but
plain
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
lighter
than
the
style
and
appearance
would
have
you
believe
a
mediocre
ale
overall
i
tend
to
find
newcastle
a
reliably
refreshing
tipple
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
for
me
it
will
always
be
an
old
standby
its
all
right
but
why
is
it
in
clearglass
bottle
this
beer
seriously
surprised
me
it
pours
a
pretty
nonexistent
head
look
like
a
deep
mahogany
in
bottle
and
glass
taste
is
subtle
but
gets
better
after
finish
it
is
a
good
brown
ale
not
mindblowing
but
rather
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
better
than
i
expected
o
i
know
its
fashionable
to
hate
on
popular
beers
but
newkie
broon
is
still
pretty
solid
ive
had
it
numerous
times
ontap
and
out
of
the
bottle
and
it
is
always
reliable
ive
yet
to
get
a
skunked
bottle
but
then
again
i
may
just
be
very
lucky
in
this
respect
i
like
this
one
with
bangers
and
mash
this
may
be
a
lightly
skunked
review
having
had
this
before
i
will
balance
my
critique
clear
ruddy
brown
with
a
respectable
head
some
lace
to
boot
as
well
smell
is
light
sweet
malt
and
faint
earth
taste
is
lightly
sweet
malt
and
earthy
hops
some
mild
butterscotch
as
well
firm
bitter
finish
is
clean
and
dry
feel
is
finely
carbonated
and
refreshing
certainly
drinkable
but
the
clear
bottles
affect
the
freshness
too
much
a
decent
brew
but
only
that
a
step
above
the
bmchineylicken
but
not
a
very
big
one
overallthis
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
after
drinking
other
brown
ales
this
is
kind
of
disgraceful
mediocre
at
best
flavor
and
a
pretty
poor
aroma
for
a
premium
priced
brown
ale
something
im
glad
i
grew
out
of
drinking
now
that
my
palate
has
matured
there
just
much
better
options
out
there
for
the
price
i
had
this
again
at
red
robin
and
to
me
the
flavor
and
moutfeel
were
better
than
i
previously
had
entered
in
the
review
i
adjusted
but
felt
the
smell
was
muted
so
took
a
14
point
away
o
its
a
decent
go
to
brew
not
huge
in
the
craft
world
but
its
one
of
my
overall
picks
at
places
that
dont
have
much
of
a
selection
pretty
solid
for
a
decent
flavor
and
satisfying
brew
but
there
are
definitely
better
brown
ales
out
there
but
this
one
is
a
good
base
this
is
a
type
that
is
meant
for
people
getting
into
beers
with
taste
its
far
from
anything
special
but
if
you
want
to
get
a
keg
of
it
then
im
sure
that
no
one
would
complain
of
it
at
a
party
i
would
not
buy
this
if
i
want
to
be
amazed
though
not
a
whole
lot
of
depth
but
an
easy
drinking
wholly
average
beer
d
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
downing
one
of
these
wont
make
you
ill
or
leave
you
with
a
pounding
headache
in
the
morning
my
girlfriend
and
i
finished
the
sixpack
i
got
for
old
times
sake
but
it
took
effort
when
english
browns
have
proliferated
so
much
particularly
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
you
can
afford
to
skip
this
one
overall
an
ok
brew
but
mediocre
as
a
brown
ale
flavors
could
be
fuller
and
darker
o
i
like
it
it
is
very
drinkable
because
of
its
not
that
strong
taste
this
beer
is
good
to
pair
with
any
food
overall
a
bit
underwhelming
smells
of
caramel
bread
skunk
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
watery
carbonated
caramel
skunk
sweet
and
skunky
i
used
to
really
like
this
beer
until
i
tried
it
in
a
can
it
was
so
much
better
it
didnt
have
that
skunk
flavor
generally
recomended
but
dont
think
this
is
some
keepatbay
heavyweight
buy
a
6pack
and
have
it
around
d
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ale
the
flavor
profile
feels
full
and
interesting
and
the
color
looked
great
overall
i
think
that
brown
ales
either
go
the
way
of
lots
of
alcohol
or
sweet
this
one
is
sweet
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
but
very
drinkable
it
takes
knocks
for
the
macrobrew
watery
feel
i
think
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
a
poor
excuse
for
an
ale
incredibly
bland
and
watery
with
an
insubstantial
body
not
to
be
upheld
as
an
example
of
the
style
perhaps
it
was
a
better
beer
in
times
gone
by
but
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
enjoys
the
reputation
it
seems
to
have
among
many
avoid
in
favour
of
something
better
enjoy
edit
ive
lurked
here
for
a
long
time
and
have
come
to
trust
certain
posters
reviews
when
looking
to
try
a
new
brew
so
a
big
thanks
to
yall
a
very
nice
beer
easy
drinking
easy
to
get
along
with
no
matter
your
taste
let
your
budweiserdrinking
buddies
try
this
one
though
a
traditional
beer
there
are
far
better
english
browns
out
there
o
an
easydrinking
dark
beer
for
those
who
are
tired
of
lager
and
typical
styles
of
beer
compliments
seafood
dishes
wonderfully
all
in
all
not
a
very
good
beer
the
first
one
is
bearable
the
ones
that
follow
become
harder
and
harder
to
swallow
d
a
very
drinkable
tasty
reliable
brew
that
is
like
comfort
beer
familiar
brown
ale
that
is
not
setting
the
world
afire
but
is
good
o
not
a
bad
choice
when
immersed
in
a
bmc
locale
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
most
other
brown
ales
overall
this
beer
does
not
compare
very
well
with
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
but
i
would
stop
short
of
saying
it
is
less
than
average
if
i
was
craving
a
brown
ale
at
a
restaurant
that
served
nothing
else
i
would
drink
newcastle
fine
dining
needs
to
increase
their
beer
knowledge
like
they
have
their
wine
knowledge
and
food
pairings
o
a
good
beer
something
i
enjoy
when
im
wanting
an
ale
thats
not
over
the
top
with
hops
o
overall
having
had
it
in
can
bottle
and
on
tap
the
tap
is
the
better
of
the
three
followed
by
the
can
then
the
bottle
the
bottled
version
always
has
that
skunky
smell
and
taste
whenever
you
get
it
so
if
you
can
get
it
from
the
can
hits
hard
with
a
heavy
sting
of
carbonation
then
slightly
sweet
molasses
and
slightly
bitter
citrus
and
some
astringent
alcohol
finishes
dry
very
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
but
it
is
unremarkable
and
short
on
flavor
final
grade

a

nice
dark
brown
color
with
dark
amber
red
highlights
small

less

inch
dissipates
quickly
does
not
have
a

what
light
smell
it
has
is
sweet
and
malty
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
but
not
much
complexity
to
the
flavor
some
caramely
sugar
is
evident
in
the
maltiness
only
light
hoppy
bitterness
very
drinkable
nothing
particularly
memorable
overall
b
overall
nice
to
try
bit
single
dimensional
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
better
than
expected
a
good
brown
ale
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
tastes
good
actually
a
bit
sweet
and
not
entirely
too
spendy
probably
a
bit
overpriced
but
so
are
its
competitors
this
is
one
of
my
defacto
fridge
beers
and
is
an
all
around
great
simple
refreshing
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
im
happy
i
can
find
this
on
tap
at
most
places
i
go
as
it
tastes
a
lot
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
for
me
this
is
fairly
bland
other
than
the
sweet
breadcaramel
half
pint
would
do
me
right
overall
this
is
a
very
boring
beer
but
extremely
drinkable

newcastle
brown
ale
has
character
and
a
good
body
but
the
adjunct
qualities
start
to
surface
after
a
bit
id
still
choose
this
over
an
actual
adjunct
produced
beer
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
amber
similarities
not
something
i
could
get
into
even
if
this
bottle
wasnt
skunked
i
couldnt
see
this
being
too
enjoyable
just
way
too
bland
and
average
the
only
way
ill
drink
this
again
is
if
its
from
a
can
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
one
not
great
but
good
definitely
a
brown
ale
true
to
style
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
to
say
the
least
i
might
buy
this
brand
again
if
i
am
ever
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
i
cant
tell
you
how
many
times
ive
had
this
classic
but
now
ive
decided
to
finally
sit
down
and
review
it
it
pours
a
clear
light
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
caramel
dusty
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
light
grass
its
all
pretty
meek
lemme
tell
ya
the
taste
refuses
to
change
things
up
very
much
save
in
the
intensity
department
and
its
not
like
it
went
crazy
with
that
particular
decision
this
isnt
to
say
it
tastes
bad
it
just
doesnt
really
taste
all
that
much
at
all
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
smooth
feel
overall
a
real
easydrinker
something
that
doesnt
pretend
to
be
more
than
it
is
ill
likely
have
many
more
in
the
future
caramel
and
sweet
barley
malts
that
are
the
main
character
of
the
beer
a
light
hop
bite
is
present
in
the
back
that
round
out
the
flavors
making
this
a
beer
that
anybody
could
like
the
fact
of
the
matter
with
this
one
is
the
amazing
drinkability
of
it
it
goes
down
super
smooth
and
thats
one
of
the
main
reasons
its
so
popular
its
a
decent
beer
macro
or
not
as
smooth
as
it
is
its
got
a
really
nice
zest
to
the
mouthfeel
that
furthers
along
the
rounding
out
of
the
beer
it
makes
the
malts
pop
overall
just
a
good
drink
and
one
that
the
world
can
appreciate
overall
good
beer
delicate
but
tasty
could
have
a
sixpack
and
would
want
to
overall
easy
to
drink
not
dynamic
a
total
mass
market
product
i
once
thought
this
was
an
excellent
beer
now
i
think
its
fine
for
washing
down
popcorn
o
its
perfect
balance
and
its
refreshing
feel
make
this
beer
a
standout
in
terms
of
drinkabilty
its
not
everyday
that
you
can
find
a
beer
that
feels
delicate
complex
and
that
you
could
drink
in
loads
without
getting
tired
only
lightly
carbonated
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
overall
not
terrible
a
decent
macrotype
brown
ale
if
im
going
for
a
cheaper
beer
i
can
handle
a
nukie
brown
much
better
than
most
american
macros
but
if
i
were
getting
beer
for
myself
i
would
only
pick
it
up
if
there
wasnt
anything
else
and
i
really
needed
to
get
something
for
whatever
reason
overall
simply
a
browncolored
lager
very
little
to
remember
except
for
slight
hops
making
it
a
modicum
more
tasty
than
a
regular
light
lager
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
a
pretty
drab
if
passable
brown
ale
lacking
body
flavourfulness
and
complexity
a
bit
gassy
but
otherwise
very
sessionable
and
best
for
social
drinking
had
newcastle
at
the
keystone
pub
for
the
first
time
on
322008
i
saw
it
on
the
bottle
list
there
after
having
most
of
what
was
on
the
list
already
i
chose
to
try
something
new
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
light
brown
color
very
clear
looking
with
a
fizzy
whie
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
skunky
but
not
enough
to
hinder
the
beer
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
nutty
caramel
flavor
going
on
that
fades
into
a
bitter
dry
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
this
is
pretty
light
and
has
a
low
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
good
as
a
casual
or
social
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
not
up
there
with
the
craft
beers
as
far
as
complexity
of
taste
being
that
it
was
really
singlefaceted
with
just
being
a
malty
beer
but
it
was
better
than
other
widedistribution
beers
nonetheless
i
would
call
this
a
very
mediocre
beer
i
was
hoping
for
more
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
certainly
not
my
favorite
but
ive
certainly
had
worse
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
brown
ale
i
think
the
convenience
of
the
draughtkeg
system
goes
well
with
a
session
beer
like
this
a
great
combination
for
a
party
overall
this
beer
is
of
the
upmost
drinkability
and
quality
taste
especially
being
a
macro
beer
but
like
all
other
imported
beers
this
is
just
another
wonderful
beverage
to
have
its
well
worth
the
price
this
is
a
beer
to
always
keep
in
the
fridge
o
i
didnt
like
this
brew
but
the
flavors
were
somewhat
pronounced
and
balanced
and
they
seemed
to
transition
well
there
wasnt
much
i
got
for
hops
in
it
bittering
or
aroma
its
an
okay
brew
that
some
will
love
but
its
not
the
brew
for
me
if
you
like
a
bread
like
brew
that
ends
with
a
smoky
kind
of
burnt
taste
to
it
this
would
be
an
awesome
ale
for
you
overall
i
enjoyed
it
nothing
extraordinary
but
its
alright
definitely
an
iconic
brown
ale
worth
trying
and
coming
back
to
when
youre
looking
for
something
basic
to
drink
mindlessly
its
a
decent
generic
type
of
beer
its
the
beer
that
got
me
into
trying
different
beers
other
than
the
giant
beer
companies
so
in
that
sense
it
holds
a
special
place
it
does
not
have
as
much
flavor
as
other
brown
ales
but
it
is
slightly
sweet
and
simple
a
good
starter
beer
for
a
beginning
beer
drinker
i
like
how
the
label
looks
and
it
makes
me
want
white
castle
burgers
which
by
the
well
it
does
go
well
with
o
looks
somewhat
promising
but
the
further
you
get
into
the
drink
the
more
your
let
down
way
to
watery
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
light
brown
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
foamy
sheets
of
lacing
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
toasted
malt
some
nuttiness
and
an
off
metallic
smell
taste
is
of
the
toasted
malt
some
slight
caramel
slight
nut
and
subtle
hops
the
metallic
smell
i
got
is
also
in
the
taste
somewhat
this
beer
has
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
bit
coating
in
the
mouth
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
widely
available
nothing
too
great
or
too
horrible
im
not
huge
on
brown
ales
and
this
ones
no
superstar
among
them
pours
a
cola
brown
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
somewhat
weak
aroma
toasted
malts
and
plasticy
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
with
touches
of
chocolate
perhaps
lightmedium
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
and
not
very
drinkable
very
drinkable
nothing
remarkable
about
this
beer
but
very
tasty
and
heads
above
most
macro
lagers
this
is
a
good
brew
that
again
must
be
enjoyed
from
the
tap
before
making
a
final
ruling
ontap
is
where
it
shines
not
in
a
bottle
newcastle
brown
is
to
an
english
brown
as
becks
is
to
a
german
pils
actually
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
fruity
version
of
shiner
bock
overall
easy
to
drink
not
too
complex
should
be
an
easy
transition
beer
for
bmc
drinkers
coming
to
the
craft
side
i
could
drink
several
of
these
its
not
bad
but
i
would
probably
move
on
to
more
interesting
flavors
after
one
or
two
i
dont
know
why
newcastle
makes
there
beers
in
clear
bottles
its
fing
stupid
as
shit
i
know
this
beer
is
going
to
be
skunky
but
its
not
my
fault
they
decided
to
make
a
beer
in
a
clear
bottle
so
i
will
grade
it
accordingly
this
beer
pours
a
small
one
finger
white
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
it
looks
like
i
will
get
good
lacing
out
of
it
but
im
not
sure
the
body
is
dark
brown
with
hues
of
red
overall
it
looks
pretty
nice
accept
for
the
head
disappearing
fast
smell
is
slightly
skunky
slightly
malts
with
hints
of
coffee
cocoa
molasses
etc
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
many
different
flavors
i
am
getting
on
the
smell
we
will
see
if
it
translates
to
the
taste
but
for
now
its
not
too
bad
i
cant
say
its
a
great
smell
because
of
the
skunk
but
its
not
very
much
skunk
just
a
little
bit
noticeable
but
not
unbearable
by
any
means
the
taste
however
is
not
very
good
at
all
for
starters
there
is
not
nearly
enough
carbonation
it
feels
like
strait
water
in
my
mouth
secondly
the
taste
is
just
all
over
the
place
the
three
most
detectable
flavors
i
get
are
water
skunk
and
maple
syrup
but
not
a
good
maple
syrup
taste
a
fake
watery
thin
male
syrup
taste
there
might
be
a
tiny
bit
of
malts
and
a
smidgen
of
hops
in
the
finish
but
not
nearly
enough
to
save
this
beer
overall
its
just
way
too
watery
frankly
it
tastes
like
mineral
water
that
has
lost
its
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
low
due
to
the
bad
mouthfeel
and
the
not
so
great
taste
overall
on
this
beer
bad
taste
horrendous
mouthfeel
and
all
around
just
not
that
great
o
this
is
a
beer
that
has
been
dumbed
down
for
the
macro
masses
not
a
bad
beer
but
certianly
not
what
one
would
recommend
in
a
brown
ale
overall
this
a
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
while
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
depth
or
flavor
it
is
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
satisfying
a
decent
go
to
beer
drinkability
well
it
wasnt
too
bad
but
there
was
nothing
about
this
beer
that
stood
out
either
because
of
the
low
alcohol
content
it
goes
down
easily
enough
and
isnt
especially
filling
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
for
a
session
beer
because
its
just
too
bland
recommendation
if
youre
looking
for
a
session
beer
keep
looking
find
something
more
interesting
if
youre
committed
to
an
english
brown
ale
try
a
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
instead
overall
id
love
to
get
this
in
a
can
and
have
it
on
tap
to
see
the
difference
without
the
slight
skunk
the
bottle
gives
hopefully
its
richer
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
o
very
drinkable
in
session
if
youre
in
the
mood
great
for
parties
or
dinners
where
beer
isnt
the
main
feature
essentially
a
great
tablebeer
but
nothing
earthshaking
a
good
notyellow
stock
ale
to
have
around
should
go
well
with
anything
from
fish
to
fowl
to
beef
and
pasta
and
almost
anything
else
not
the
best
out
there
but
something
i
keep
around
on
a
regular
basis
not
bad
not
great
overall
good
smooth
ale
no
off
flavors
d
cold
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
warmer
its
a
decent
sipping
beer
the
flavors
are
much
more
complex
at
5565
degrees
its
an
ok
beer
and
something
id
order
if
theres
nothing
better
available
but
not
something
ill
stock
in
my
fridge
besides
i
dont
trust
those
clear
bottles
if
i
were
in
the
upper
midwest
in
the
middle
of
february
snowed
in
and
days
away
from
a
thaw
a
fridge
full
of
these
might
be
just
the
ticket
unremarkable
but
drinkable
and
just
enough
going
on
to
keep
things
a
little
interesting
an
easy
drinking
and
accessible
ale
but
these
days
i
feel
it
lacks
depth
beyond
that
this
beer
was
very
good
and
very
light
which
suprised
me
because
of
its
dark
brown
color
i
had
it
from
one
of
those
5l
keg
cans
and
loved
every
liter
of
it
it
was
very
light
and
smooth
and
was
able
to
drink
it
all
night
long
definitly
will
keep
this
in
mind
if
i
see
it
on
tap
i
wonder
how
it
compares
in
the
bottle
d
this
isnt
terrible
but
i
am
disappointed
i
havent
had
this
in
years
but
i
remember
it
as
one
of
my
early
gateway
beers
i
distinctly
recall
it
as
seeming
a
fair
step
up
from
a
heiny
funny
that
as
the
skunkiness
really
hurts
this
beer
it
is
probably
better
in
a
can
or
even
a
boxed
in
12pack
still
it
is
decent
and
drinkable
enough
but
it
is
not
living
up
to
my
memories
in
a
pinch
this
swill
could
be
consumed
i
guess
an
underrated
brew
i
highly
recommend
it
needless
to
say
i
was
disapointed
in
this
beer
md
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
smooth
noncarbonated
feel
in
the
mouth
a
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
but
that
sweetness
on
the
aftertaste
hurts
the
drinkability
poured
this
newcastle
brown
ale
from
a
pint
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
brown
color
very
clear
it
has
a
thick
off
white
creamy
head
the
head
quickly
vanishes
head
retention
is
poor
lacing
is
average
at
best
the
aroma
is
not
very
appealing
i
dont
smell
any
nut
to
speak
of
it
actually
smells
more
like
a
czech
pils
then
it
does
a
nut
brown
the
body
is
very
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
this
beer
is
very
disappointing
because
the
last
time
a
had
thisabout
4
years
ago
i
loved
it
it
was
a
staple
in
my
fridge
i
just
remember
it
being
so
much
better
its
amazing
how
much
your
tastes
evolve
this
was
one
of
my
first
gateway
beers
ill
have
to
give
it
respect
due
to
the
fact
that
it
put
me
on
a
path
a
path
to
better
beer
unfortunately
for
new
castle
i
found
it
prost
dr
its
standard
abv
low
price
and
in
dire
need
of
attention
in
the
mouthfeel
department
skip
it
i
do
look
forward
to
trying
this
brewerys
other
beers
because
they
seem
to
have
some
idea
of
what
theyre
doing
its
really
disappointing
i
bet
theyre
just
catering
to
what
customers
want
and
thats
thin
shite
beer
that
can
get
them
loaded
poured
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
light
brown
head
that
dissapated
rapidly
the
aroma
was
that
of
sweet
malts
with
a
bready
overtone
it
tasted
slightly
bitter
and
watery
with
hardly
any
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
very
light
and
bland
overall
an
average
beer
have
had
much
better
brown
ales
this
is
a
great
drink
it
goes
down
very
well
super
creamy
and
just
a
great
mixture
of
flavors
that
refreshes
the
palate
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
its
got
a
decent
abv
allows
the
drinker
to
consume
a
few
great
brew
d
tastes
like
new
castle
it
is
what
it
is
very
standard
edition
of
the
style
d
easy
drinker
for
me
goes
down
smooth
good
session
beer
for
sure
d
there
is
nothing
offensive
here
its
plain
like
an
amish
beer
nothing
fancy
and
showy
just
a
plain
beer
d
could
drink
many
of
these
but
not
really
sure
i
would
want
to
just
an
average
brew
went
pretty
good
with
spicy
sausage
spaghetti
sauce
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
puckering
awfulness
after
swallowing
i
cant
believe
there
was
a
time
when
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
atrocious
flavor
unattractive
scent
and
an
overall
poor
experience
one
of
my
first
non
adjunct
beers
and
a
beer
i
have
fond
memories
of
unfortunately
as
my
palate
develops
my
fondness
for
newcastle
has
not
still
its
better
than
many
of
the
other
readily
available
beers
one
of
the
better
beers
readily
available
a
happy
inbetween
of
not
too
filling
not
too
light
a
skunk
bottle
may
ruin
a
1st
impression
of
this
beer
a
great
introductory
brown
beer
for
those
who
drink
bud
and
miller
out
of
habbit
just
a
hint
of
nutty
brown
flavor
and
creaminess
at
its
best
when
it
is
just
a
little
cooler
than
room
temperature
drinkability
well
if
i
wanted
a
beer
and
this
was
all
they
had
at
a
party
id
more
then
likely
drink
it
the
carbonation
effects
the
drinkability
because
it
fills
you
up
and
too
much
and
too
fast
i
more
then
likely
wont
buy
this
again
for
myself
but
i
am
happy
i
took
the
time
to
try
it
di
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
its
not
that
the
taste
was
offensive
or
a
bad
beer
it
was
just
like
someone
took
a
good
brown
ale
and
mixed
it
half
and
half
with
water
taste
is
a
very
mild
one
for
style
there
is
a
slight
nuttiness
with
a
little
bit
of
toffee
a
small
crispness
with
hops
at
the
back
a
little
toasty
malt
can
be
observed
in
the
finish
notice
everything
is
small
a
restrained
beer
drinkable
but
light
m
d
stays
with
you
a
while
sweet
side
of
things
but
the
metallic
taste
is
unlike
any
other
it
is
not
like
most
nut
browns
its
really
its
own
style
its
a
good
old
standby
easily
accessable
always
dependably
the
same
better
than
most
macros
this
beer
is
my
go
to
it
has
a
great
taste
and
is
easy
to
get
anywhere
for
the
reasonable
price
i
have
had
this
on
draught
as
well
and
its
even
better
if
you
are
an
ale
fan
this
is
one
to
try
or
retry
i
would
like
to
try
and
make
my
own
personal
brew
similar
to
this
one
medium
body
good
balance
of
nutty
flavor
maltiness
and
bitterness
the
higher
level
of
bitterness
on
this
brown
definitely
gives
it
more
character
and
makes
it
interesting
d
well
balanced
but
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
taste
maybe
newcastle
should
try
dark
bottles
see
what
happens
ill
never
buy
or
probably
even
accept
a
newcastle
again
im
drinking
it
but
it
is
really
a
terrible
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
glass
the
nose
brings
some
light
toffee
and
caramel
plus
a
faint
bit
of
nuttiness
the
nutty
character
comes
through
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
along
with
plenty
of
the
toffee
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
drinks
fairly
well
but
isnt
something
id
go
after
with
other
choices
available
drinkability
maybe
as
a
closing
beer
after
youre
drunk
this
would
be
considered
drinkable
md
a
slightly
heavy
beer
but
not
heavy
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
slides
down
the
throat
and
coats
the
pallet
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
because
it
has
a
low
alcohol
content
and
isnt
very
filling
however
i
wouldnt
consider
this
to
be
sessionable
because
the
flavor
isnt
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
this
is
a
good
session
beer
one
of
the
first
beers
to
expand
the
american
market
and
i
think
it
does
a
pretty
good
job
for
a
beer
that
almost
every
barrestaurant
has
usually
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
appearance
shows
a
clear
brown
copper
color
slightly
roasted
nutty
flavor
flavor
is
nutty
a
bit
bitter
and
toasted
very
simple
but
very
wellbalanced
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
bit
watery
thin
overall
kind
of
boring
but
very
seasonable
and
flawless
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
reddishbrown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
nutmeg
and
pecans
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
lowmild
carbonation
overall
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
this
brew
at
all
never
have
been
just
glad
i
didnt
have
to
drink
a
full
pint
of
this
this
might
be
a
good
gateway
brew
for
some
people
but
not
for
my
palate
at
all
drink
is
low
why
import
this
stuff
when
you
can
get
much
better
locally
brewed
beer
nice
looking
beer
darker
amber
that
glistens
when
held
up
to
the
light
nice
amount
of
carbonation
as
seen
by
the
bubbles
making
their
way
up
to
the
surface
head
is
pretty
full
recedes
down
to
a
good
covering
after
a
few
minutes
pretty
good
lacing
throughout
bit
of
ragweed
in
the
smell
faint
floral
hop
aroma
some
sweet
malts
not
much
else
going
on
here
nice
malty
sweetness
in
the
taste
a
bit
of
grains
and
just
a
touch
of
roasty
flavor
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
to
medium
with
a
crisp
and
refreshing
feel
to
it
carbonation
is
quite
high
adds
a
tingling
effect
to
each
sip
quite
different
than
what
ive
had
on
tap
more
crisp
and
light
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
good
choice
when
in
a
pinch
or
at
a
restaurant
that
has
a
poor
beer
selection
easily
one
of
my
favorite
does
not
leave
any
bad
aftertaste
suitable
for
times
you
dont
want
to
take
notes
or
for
social
gatherings
but
too
sweet
and
onedimensional
to
be
a
regular
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
and
no
head
to
speak
of
this
smells
lightly
roasted
but
then
tastes
like
sweet
nutty
malts
and
a
kind
of
buttery
or
metallic
quality
mouthfeel
is
watery
not
a
huge
fani
find
that
this
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
quickly
and
it
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
get
through
my
glass
wont
be
repeating
d
very
drinkable
with
a
grilled
burger
d
average
this
is
an
average
import
beer
that
i
imagine
would
go
well
with
multiple
different
types
of
food
but
it
doesnt
really
shine
on
its
own
d
drinks
super
easy
used
to
not
like
this
brew
at
one
point
but
its
got
a
balanced
maltbarleyhop
thing
going
for
it
i
got
gifted
15
bottles
of
this
stuff
from
a
neighbor
coming
back
around
he
had
enough
i
guess
not
my
pick
of
brew
but
better
that
some
millerbud
free
overall
what
happened
to
this
brew
has
it
changed
that
much
since
i
used
to
enjoy
it
1015
years
ago
or
have
my
tastes
evolved
this
was
a
big
disappointment
i
already
know
enough
to
never
buy
this
stuff
in
an
open
sixer
as
the
clear
bottle
leads
to
skunkiness
very
quickly
thus
i
bought
a
closed
12
pack
thinking
this
would
be
at
least
a
sessionable
beer
from
memory
bad
choice
it
was
hard
to
finish
one
this
will
be
my
last
memory
of
newckie
brown
overall
a
good
beer
to
drink
at
a
small
bar
that
doesnt
have
much
selection
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
at
a
store
though
especially
with
that
clear
glass
bottle
presented
in
a
standard
pint
glass
with
a
thin
whisper
of
head
no
retention
or
lacing
dark
amberbrown
color
with
sharp
clarity
smell
is
very
mild
toasted
malts
and
buttery
toffee
palate
is
balanced
and
pleasant
mostly
toasted
malts
with
a
kiss
of
earthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fluid
good
drinkability
and
wide
availability
make
this
worth
try
but
its
a
far
cry
from
being
great
it
tastes
feels
good
but
the
smell
could
be
better
in
my
opinion
though
definitely
give
this
a
try
i
think
youll
like
it
big
ben
draft
is
excellent
very
nutty
slightly
sweet
but
very
drinkable
not
something
to
have
regularly
however
in
some
situations
i
might
find
myself
having
this
again
overall
a
nice
approach
of
a
sweet
beer
tried
this
because
a
lot
of
my
friends
drink
a
lot
of
it
so
my
impression
of
the
beer
in
one
word
is
ehhh
aroma
is
grainy
taste
is
malty
sweetness
a
bit
caramelly
with
an
ever
so
slight
bitterness
in
the
end
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
but
i
do
think
is
a
great
intro
to
craft
beer
for
noobs
tho
they
dont
have
a
artlabel
rating
id
rank
it
as
pretty
cool
i
really
like
it
quite
charming
d
recommendable
a
soild
beer
will
order
more
often
wife
even
liked
it
a
mild
and
somewhat
insipid
brown
ale
i
can
see
why
some
people
like
it
but
i
find
it
dull
i
used
to
love
this
beer
but
that
was
before
craft
beer
ruined
my
palate
rather
watery
and
boring
d
not
bad
its
ok
on
tap
and
its
a
good
choice
for
a
drink
at
a
restaurant
if
there
isnt
anything
good
on
the
menu
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
but
it
lacks
any
notes
that
could
be
considered
memorable
perfectly
carbonated
with
that
great
ale
finish
a
great
beer
that
is
readily
available
at
most
stores
that
sell
beer
great
year
round
d
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
could
sip
all
night
reasonably
priced
for
an
english
brown
ale
very
good
at
warmer
temperatures
aswell
poured
from
the
clear
bottle
dark
medium
brown
color
with
one
finger
tan
head
quickly
dissipating
smell
was
toasty
and
roasty
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
was
nutty
and
malty
with
only
minimal
hops
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
easy
drinking
this
is
probably
much
better
on
tap
but
not
so
bad
from
the
bottle
either
kind
of
average
more
cult
than
substance
just
an
all
around
great
beer
love
it
winterspringsummerfall
it
is
fantastic
newcastle
is
truly
at
its
best
when
chilled
considerably
i
started
drinking
this
in
bottles
but
one
i
found
out
it
was
available
for
the
beertender
i
immediately
purchased
on
and
began
buying
the
mini
kegs
the
only
complaint
i
have
since
switching
to
the
mini
kegs
is
that
i
cannot
control
the
temperature
on
my
beertender
other
than
that
the
beer
itself
speaks
for
itself
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
would
expect
to
come
from
northeast
england
good
on
a
cold
night
especially
in
the
winter
time
you
get
here
on
the
east
coast
very
refreshing
best
on
tap
i
must
admit
i
absolutely
love
newcastle
brown
ale
and
theres
nothing
better
than
watching
the
footy
with
a
few
bottles
or
even
a
few
to
start
the
night
off
it
seems
to
have
a
distinct
taste
and
is
up
there
with
the
best
in
the
market
usually
supermarkets
such
as
sainsburys
and
asda
do
a
deal
4
bottles
for
a
fiver
which
is
a
good
d
its
a
decent
brown
ale
that
isnt
spectacular
but
isnt
bad
it
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
d
yes
its
a
drinkable
session
beer
newcastle
is
my
absolute
goto
beer
that
i
know
i
can
find
in
every
supermarket
and
beer
store
nearby
im
trying
not
to
be
too
liberal
with
my
rating
on
this
but
its
hard
to
give
it
a
low
rating
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
frothy
two
finger
slighlty
off
white
head
the
head
gives
way
to
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
faint
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
and
hops
the
taste
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
along
with
a
roasted
malt
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
woodinessnuttiness
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
slightly
creamy
the
drinkability
is
average
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
this
beer
but
there
is
nothing
to
really
make
you
want
more
it
is
an
average
beer
all
around
drink
a
really
good
session
beer
that
is
worth
trying
nothing
spectacular
just
a
good
solid
brew
drinkability
pretty
good
low
alcohol
nice
drinkability
simple
and
uninteresting
but
not
bad
enjoy
this
one
all
year
around
d
this
is
not
a
good
beer
i
dont
know
if
this
is
an
old
example
that
is
oxidized
or
if
this
is
a
us
version
that
is
inferior
to
the
original
if
this
is
how
it
always
tastes
i
dont
know
how
it
got
famous
brown
ales
are
good
b
grade
beers
they
dont
have
to
be
amazing
to
be
great
and
they
can
be
passable
even
when
they
leave
certain
things
to
be
desired
that
in
mind
for
being
from
a
larger
brewery
this
isnt
half
bad
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
reddishbrown
with
negligible
head
aroma
is
very
weak
mostly
earthy
hops
very
thin
for
a
brown
ale
and
very
dry
not
much
is
going
on
a
flavor
side
i
love
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
terrible
beer
i
could
not
finish
a
bottle
the
beer
is
easily
available
everywhere
but
this
is
the
last
time
i
try
it
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
easy
to
find
beers
it
is
available
pretty
much
everywhere
the
first
thing
i
notice
about
this
brew
is
the
amber
reddish
hue
the
beers
smell
is
slightly
weak
but
has
a
strong
finish
minimal
head
and
a
smoooth
taste
d
you
can
drink
a
lot
because
it
is
weak
why
do
people
rave
about
this
beer
there
are
better
british
beers
better
brown
ales
and
better
imports
just
cant
wrap
my
head
around
it
contains
barley
wheat
pours
reddish
brown
clear
beer
with
decent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
rather
sweet
caramel
nuts
simple
andnot
very
strong
mild
kvasslike
taste
sweet
malt
unmalted
ingredients
slightly
metallic
hint
alcohol
is
being
perceived
excessively
neutral
mouthfeel
and
drinking
process
is
not
an
act
of
delectation
httpabarwithnoname

com
d
i
could
pick
this
up
again
but
realistically
see
myself
buying
more
budweiser
than
this
stuff
mouthfeel
thin
but
im
no
english
ale
expert
so
it
has
benegit
of
the
doubt
drinkability
based
on
availability
cost
and
tastiness
this
is
perfectly
drinkable
you
can
find
it
everywhere
its
only
a
little
more
than
macrobrewed
swillwater
and
its
actually
got
a
nice
unique
character
medium
brownish
color
light
tan
head
light
roasted
scent
hints
of
coffee
caramel
and
dry
yeast
smells
good
all
and
all
and
definitely
makes
me
eager
to
take
my
first
sip
of
it
overly
sweet
nice
malty
profile
but
has
a
good
balanced
taste
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
balanced
decent
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
just
right
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
because
it
offers
up
a
lot
of
different
characteristics
so
it
can
be
enjoyed
at
various
times
of
the
day
seasons
or
occasions
depending
overall
this
comes
off
as
a
beer
that
should
be
thicker
but
still
the
blend
of
tastes
and
lightness
somehow
works
making
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
time
from
a
can
newcastle
brown
is
the
archetype
for
the
style
a
classic
pours
a
nice
clear
hazelnut
brown
colour
with
a
thin
but
lastin
beige
head
very
clean
on
the
nose
some
roastiness
maybe
some
metal
from
the
can
easy
drinking
brown
ale
not
very
tasty
but
its
clean
and
refreshing
unmemorable
offering
of
a
style
i
usually
enjoy
drinkability
well
out
of
the
mini
keg
this
guy
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
its
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
not
bad
at
all
im
glad
that
i
only
had
to
buy
one
bottle
of
this
because
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
and
ill
probably
never
buy
this
again
poured
from
a
clear
bottle
into
my
glass
one
finger
head
of
light
brown
billowy
bubbles
color
is
a
26
on
the
srm
chart
smell
of
coffee
toffee
malt
chocolate
caramel
and
roasted
malt
i
taste
hints
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
caramel
toffee
some
hop
and
malt
every
sip
reveals
something
new
interesting
some
boldness
in
my
mouth
but
not
great
pleasing
flavor
good
availability
decent
price
i
will
drink
more
of
this
in
some
time
and
place
d
very
drinkable
well
balanced
verdict
really
good
exceptional
even
for
a
macro
brew
always
worth
having
around
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
its
one
that
ive
wanted
to
try
for
a
while
and
i
finally
experienced
the
english
maltyness
that
everyone
talks
about
it
definitely
is
sweet
but
not
overbearingly
so
it
still
stays
balanced
while
being
less
focused
on
hops
and
personally
i
enjoyed
it
i
drank
it
straight
out
of
a
bottle
not
a
glass
and
would
do
so
again
anytime
itd
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
now
you
can
still
session
with
it
or
drink
many
of
them
at
a
bbq
but
they
arent
light
like
the
bmc
brews
nor
is
it
too
heavy
to
put
down
in
large
quantities
overall
good
more
fullbodied
beer
than
the
bmc
usual
suspects
with
a
sweetmalty
angle
on
a
decent
darker
euro
beer
pass
on
this
one
d
its
the
one
and
only
so
what
else
is
there
to
say
i
love
this
brew
it
has
relatively
widespread
coverage
where
i
live
and
i
find
it
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
one
of
the
best
mass
produced
brews
medium
light
body
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
not
bad
for
a
commonly
available
on
tap
brew
d
sessionable
and
relatively
quaffable
loaded
with
a
bunch
of
flavor
and
character
for
a
sub
5
brew
but
nothing
here
really
reaches
out
and
grabs
your
attention
respectable
and
a
valid
option
in
a
pinch
but
not
something
that
i
would
highly
recommend
or
revisit
on
a
regular
basis
i
realize
that
this
isnt
the
best
brown
ale
out
there
but
i
had
to
start
somewhere
fairly
standard
beer
across
the
board
very
drinkable
not
offensive
a
good
one
for
those
who
are
starting
with
darker
european
styles
like
myself
d
an
ok
brown
ale
that
is
very
easy
going
down
have
had
several
times
and
something
i
would
gladly
order
over
macros
at
a
bar
d
vinous
cant
get
over
it
im
not
too
experienced
in
english
brown
ales
but
if
this
is
a
broad
representation
of
the
style
than
i
certainly
want
to
try
more
overall
good
beer
that
is
very
flexible
to
have
with
food
in
a
session
or
just
something
that
is
a
little
different
could
be
something
to
ease
session
drinking
friends
into
broadening
the
horizons
back
then
broon
was
a
very
regional
beer
careful
marketing
has
made
it
the
huge
international
phenomenon
it
is
now
it
may
not
be
as
great
as
many
of
the
beers
youll
drink
but
its
not
a
bad
place
to
start
drinkability
is
very
goodextraordinarily
sessionable
but
still
quite
bland
and
uninspired
dgoes
down
easy
the
taste
stays
a
lot
of
it
can
be
consumed
but
still
not
my
choice
for
a
session
drinker
definitely
a
mainstream
brew
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
beats
bmc
beats
heineken
or
any
mexican
beer
like
corona
if
nothing
better
is
around
go
for
it
transparent
brown
in
color
with
offwhite
head
that
leaves
lacing
grains
cereal
sunflower
seeds
in
the
nose
grains
cereal
a
toasted
note
toward
the
finish
vague
hop
bitterness
but
no
real
hop
flavor
light
in
body
and
in
carbonation
a
very
sessionable
ale
that
doesnt
take
much
risk
in
flavor
sam
smiths
nut
brown
ale
its
a
lot
more
bland
its
an
ok
beer
i
do
like
more
flavor
in
my
beer
one
good
thing
is
if
your
looking
for
a
beer
to
pound
down
all
night
then
this
would
work
very
well
an
okay
beer
i
would
put
this
offering
much
higher
than
almost
all
of
the
american
massproduced
beers
but
not
a
name
to
mention
amoung
the
top
beers
to
try
pours
a
ruby
brown
colour
with
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
without
much
lacing
smells
of
mild
nuttiness
with
some
toasted
malt
flavour
is
also
muted
ok
carbonation
just
an
ok
brown
ale
i
used
to
like
this
a
more
before
i
was
really
into
beer
da
popular
overrated
english
import
better
than
anything
from
bmc
so
it
is
somewhat
cheery
to
hear
nonenthusiasts
refer
to
this
as
a
good
beer
but
this
cant
hold
a
candle
to
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
d
this
could
not
be
improved
in
my
opinion
it
is
probably
one
of
my
top
5
most
drinkable
beers
i
do
not
think
that
is
by
mistake
i
think
that
it
is
brewed
with
this
in
mind
5
0
d
refreshing
and
simple
there
isnt
much
to
this
beer
which
is
just
fine
but
it
didnt
do
anything
to
excite
me
either
38
out
of
50
sounds
about
right
this
beer
is
in
the
style
guidelines
after
all
this
is
easily
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
i
love
me
some
newcastle
brown
ale
i
could
seriously
drink
it
all
day
probably
the
easiest
to
drink
and
enjoy
that
ive
ever
had
its
just
simply
and
amazing
beer
to
drink
i
would
without
a
doubt
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
d
seriously
this
is
a
session
beer
good
example
of
how
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
complex
to
be
quite
enjoyable
to
quote
monty
burns
i
know
what
i
hate
and
i
dont
hate
this
definitely
preferable
to
the
bottle
form
newcastle
is
a
drinkable
but
very
predictable
brown
ale
overly
sweet
a
bit
flat
but
i
can
soldier
through
it
way
better
than
most
diageobmc
stuff
on
tap
around
here
but
the
high
import
pricetag
drives
me
away
if
you
can
find
it
cheap
in
a
can
its
not
bad
just
dont
pay
too
much
for
it
theres
far
better
brown
ales
available
pours
a
modest
head
which
dissipates
quickly
brown
very
mild
and
a
touch
sweet
i
once
read
a
reviewer
say
that
people
have
strong
opinions
on
this
beer
and
id
agree
im
strongly
disliking
it
boring
except
for
the
russian
roulette
mystery
of
will
it
be
skunked
or
not
overall
not
worth
the
premium
import
price
i
would
only
drink
this
at
a
bar
with
a
limited
beer
selection
d
look
its
a
brown
ale
made
for
the
masses
smooth
flavor
allows
this
to
be
slammed
though
all
in
all
its
not
too
bad
mainly
due
to
the
roasty
character
and
hoppyness
it
is
only
opinions
of
other
beers
that
led
to
my
experience
of
this
terrible
tasting
and
thick
beer
just
not
my
style
in
any
way
drinkability
overall
an
ok
taste
they
go
down
pretty
easy
my
wife
loves
this
beer
and
was
kind
enough
to
let
me
borrow
this
one
for
a
taste
test
hehe
the
oddly
1
pint
2
6
fl
oz
bottle
not
up
to
date
on
my
conversions
though
i
think
it
would
be
a
british
pint
smells
a
bit
skunked
though
ive
encountered
it
before
from
this
bottle
size
nutty
sweet
roasted
taste
thin
but
very
enjoyable
a
deffinately
keeper
i
give
thanks
to
my
wonderful
wife
rjt
d
very
drinkable
once
again
thanks
to
the
sweetness
and
light
carbonation
not
an
offensive
beer
by
any
means
but
does
not
have
the
same
feel
as
other
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
taste
is
meh
its
sweet
and
malty
with
no
hops
at
all
its
pretty
drinkable
bit
its
got
a
bit
of
a
band
aid
taste
thats
sweet
and
funky
ok
beer
but
not
great
this
beer
always
seems
to
be
hit
or
miss
for
me
sometimes
it
tastes
delicious
and
full
a
classic
brown
ale
while
other
times
it
just
seems
bland
and
blah
im
wondering
per
the
review
below
whether
the
mass
production
has
affected
things
admittedly
my
review
is
from
the
bottle
so
i
would
like
to
taste
it
on
tap
and
revisit
drelatively
good
drinkability
if
you
enjoy
the
style
not
alot
to
look
for
or
think
about
with
this
one
d
newcastle
is
a
beer
that
really
varies
for
me
some
nights
it
is
really
good
and
others
it
is
shit
tonight
was
really
good
and
very
drinkable
but
i
always
hesitate
to
order
one
such
a
finicky
beer
when
shipped
overseas
good
ale
tastes
best
out
of
a
pint
glass
excellent
laceing
not
overly
carbonated
makes
for
easy
drinkability
you
can
govern
how
much
head
by
how
fast
you
pour
it
the
head
stays
around
for
a
good
long
time
this
ale
would
be
good
with
a
meal
or
just
to
get
drunk
on
either
way
i
recomend
it
can
pours
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
nondescript
with
hints
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
reminds
me
of
apples
for
some
reason
medium
mouthfeel
used
to
like
this
beer
prior
to
getting
into
craft
but
since
experiencing
more
beers
this
one
really
doesnt
appeal
to
me
anymore
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
well
i
didnt
pour
it
from
the
bottle
so
the
apperance
is
what
i
seen
through
the
bottle
which
is
surley
brown
almost
like
a
flat
diet
coke
the
smell
was
nice
but
the
one
i
that
i
had
was
quite
skunky
not
sure
if
it
should
smell
that
way
or
not
it
has
a
nice
taste
through
the
skunk
you
taste
lots
of
malts
like
caramel
notes
or
something
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
it
is
very
light
on
the
palate
which
gives
it
a
nice
smooth
drinkability
not
a
risky
beer
i
think
this
one
would
appeal
to
almost
everyone
i
remember
it
being
slightly
sweet
compared
to
most
with
light
carbonation
and
a
crisp
taste
i
always
enjoy
having
1
or
2
of
these
but
its
not
the
type
of
drink
that
you
want
to
have
all
the
time
or
several
in
a
row
of
a
dark
brown
ale
with
a
very
creamy
white
head
that
smothers
the
glass
in
lace
smells
of
grain
and
hay
it
has
a
creamy
and
nutty
taste
with
some
sweets
malt
back
end
goes
down
like
a
glass
of
milk
very
smooth
and
coating
this
is
thirst
quenching
and
delicious
solid
overall
this
review
is
for
the
newcastle
mini
keg
this
is
the
way
to
drink
and
enjoy
a
newkie
had
a
bbq
today
and
three
of
us
put
away
a
minikeg
with
ease
enjoyed
every
drop
the
beer
was
fresh
creamy
and
very
tasty
if
you
have
only
had
this
brew
in
a
bottle
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
a
draft
or
mini
keg
great
stuff
a
descent
brown
ale
but
nothing
to
brag
about
keep
it
as
a
beer
for
parties
because
it
is
drinkable
and
fairly
affordable
t
nice
taste
some
bitterness
at
the
end
mix
with
the
roast
there
is
no
ending
at
all
would
be
better
with
a
heavier
body
d
good
for
a
few
not
a
bad
as
some
would
want
you
to
beleive
m
refreshing
and
pleasant
at
the
beginning
changing
fast
to
a
bitter
hops
ending
poured
chestnut
brown
with
less
than
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
poor
retention
and
average
lacing
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
and
milk
chocolate
were
all
evident
in
the
nose
the
taste
revealed
the
same
mixed
with
an
earthy
hop
backdrop
and
finishing
on
a
somewhat
earthy
note
very
thin
and
modestly
carbonated
a
little
too
thin
for
me
but
theres
no
denying
that
one
could
certainly
session
this
brew
medium
light
body
with
light
carbonation
is
easy
to
quaff
in
quantity
which
is
perhaps
the
only
reason
to
buy
this
brew
poured
into

lacing
sweet
fig
tree
smell
roasted
hazelnut
taste
with
caramel
overtones
a
lighter
bodied
brown
ale
than
i
usually
enjoy
if
you
can
really
call
this
a
brown
ale
at
all
all
in
all
it
is
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
is
reasonably
priced
most
of
the
time
definitely
a
yearround
session
brew
i
keep
finding
myself
coming
back
to
this
beer
every
few
months
if
im
somewhere
with
a
not
so
good
selection
its
an
ok
beer
to
fall
back
on
dm
nice
beer
not
too
carbonated
easy
to
drink
to
be
honest
i
really
like
there
marketing
campaign
its
what
really
drew
me
to
try
this
beer
bit
pricey
considering
its
low
abv
im
used
to
a
bit
stronger
what
a
great
beer
appearance
is
exceptional
doesnt
look
like
a
beer
per
se
smell
of
wonderul
hops
and
the
head
isnt
bad
on
this
beer
either
taste
of
hops
but
not
too
strong
it
doesnt
taste
like
you
are
drinking
beer
but
it
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
smooth
taste
mouthful
cant
have
too
much
of
it
your
mouth
it
will
ruin
the
taste
drinkabilty
is
good
but
more
than
2
the
taste
will
grow
a
little
old
drinkability
good
solid
ale
not
too
much
on
the
palate
easy
to
come
back
to
for
more
d
decent
cheap
beer
dont
know
why
the
bottles
are
clear
but
whatever
good
with
food
or
as
a
drinkin
beer
no
exceptional
quality
here
though
since
newcastle
has
to
be
shipped
to
the
heineken
plant
and
kegged
there
i
wonder
if
its
economical
to
make
beer
in
england
ship
it
to
the
netherlands
and
then
repackaged
for
cali
or
in
my
case
az
d
im
still
not
a
fan
the
metallic
soapy
notes
in
the
flavor
are
enough
to
keep
me
away
in
the
future
its
boring
in
general
though
i
think
this
is
1
of
the
most
underrated
beers
on
here
it
is
lighter
than
other
brown
ales
we
are
used
to
especially
american
browns
but
it
is
a
great
go
to
beer
when
pickings
are
slim
and
is
readily
available
not
so
sure
about
the
clear
bottle
though
i
have
had
some
skunky
ones
but
this
one
im
rating
was
on
tap
at
buffalo
wild
wings
in
ashtabula
ohio
23
oz
of
lightly
roasted
malt
nutty
and
maybe
a
slight
dry
hop
finish
not
great
body
but
just
a
good
solid
drinking
beer
even
though
this
is
not
a
gourmet
this
is
the
beer
that
opened
my
eyes
to
gourmet
beers
this
may
not
be
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
very
drinkable
it
pours
with
little
head
and
dark
copper
appearance
slightly
sour
smell
but
with
clean
taste
yet
little
watery
this
is
my
first
post
i
know
its
not
the
best
but
i
am
learning
a
lot
hopefully
i
will
be
hearing
a
lot
from
everyone
and
vice
versa
when
first
trying
beer
newcastle
was
my
greatawakening
it
is
still
a
personal
favorite
and
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
i
personally
love
the
smell
and
the
mouthfeel
its
not
a
great
food
pairing
beer
in
my
opinion
but
it
makes
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
in
front
of
the
television
i
find
newcastle
to
be
an
average
beer
in
most
respects
its
my
goto
beer
if
the
only
alternatives
are
macro
lagers
like
bud
coors
etc
the
appearance
is
pleasant
a
light
brown
colalike
beer
with
a
modest
head
and
carbonation
mild
slightly
sweet
aroma
and
flavor
a
bit
of
maltiness
definitely
could
be
a
session
beer
i
prefer
the
flavor
to
a
lager
yet
it
doesnt
have
a
higher
alcohol
content
like
a
stout
i
didnt
notice
any
skunkiness
i
was
warned
about
because
of
the
clear
bottle
and
prefer
beers
from
the
bottle
over
canned
versions
ive
also
had
this
on
tap
and
didnt
notice
much
difference
its
very
drinkable
but
lacking
in
many
departments
one
of
the
worst
english
ales
that
i
have
tasted
d
this
is
the
type
of
beer
you
drink
when
you
need
to
be
refreshed
and
cooled
off
a
nobrainer
or
something
you
dont
have
to
think
about
in
conclusion
its
mild
flavor
is
a
good
beginner
beer
for
you
friends
that
arent
used
to
craft
not
impossible
to
drink
but
not
that
pleasant
either
however
i
do
like
the
slight
coffee
taste
i
wouldnt
plan
on
drinking
a
lot
this
type
of
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
where
the
whole
is
better
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
pouring
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
head
quickly
dissipates
and
the
beer
has
the
appearance
of
cola
which
might
be
offputting
for
some
beers
but
didnt
bother
me
with
newcastle
there
wasnt
much
distinctive
to
note
in
the
aroma
dark
malt
and
caramel
flavors
dominate
which
together
with
a
light
body
and
more
carbonation
than
one
would
expect
from
a
brown
ale
combine
for
a
refreshing
beer
ive
found
newcastle
is
a
good
hot
weather
session
beer
when
i
am
avoiding
corona
red
stripe
and
the
like
d
a
goto
when
i
dont
want
something
overpowering
and
just
want
to
enjoy
a
few
beers
d
not
a
favorite
of
mine
by
any
means
i
guess
id
say
ok
at
best
and
would
look
for
something
else
to
drink
i
agree
with
one
of
the
other
reviewers
it
was
better
when
i
first
had
it
in
a
pub
in
england
m
d
very
good
sits
well
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
once
you
get
the
first
one
down
drinkability
given
its
ingredients
its
not
really
a
true
brown
ale
however
its
good
enough
to
knock
back
one
or
two
ddespite
this
beer
just
being
average
its
drinkability
to
me
is
through
the
roof
i
could
easily
drink
this
for
hours
it
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
really
liked
and
it
has
a
fond
place
in
my
heart
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
over
all
its
not
that
great
not
much
to
it
a
little
of
a
let
down
for
a
beer
that
all
my
friends
say
is
a
good
one
i
would
have
expected
more
from
i
would
buy
it
again
but
its
real
low
on
my
list
d
easy
drinker
not
hard
to
get
down
newcastle
offers
an
interesting
flavor
with
moderate
drinkability
making
it
a
nice
choice
now
and
then
and
luckily
it
is
widely
available
the
smell
is
a
little
offputting
from
the
bottle
on
tap
i
would
imagine
it
is
much
better
there
are
some
nice
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
the
taste
is
typical
brown
ale
bliss
sweet
a
little
bittercrisp
on
the
finish
for
such
a
common
beer
to
get
ahold
of
it
has
an
interesting
palette
it
is
on
the
light
side
for
an
ale
but
that
is
not
always
a
bad
thing
this
is
a
good
introductory
brown
ale
d
this
is
my
favorite
session
beer
i
can
drink
them
all
night
long
i
really
liked
this
beer
so
much
in
england
i
brought
a
12
pack
back
with
me
to
the
states
once
in
the
states
it
has
never
been
as
good
as
in
england
but
still
very
drinkable
i
have
also
noticed
a
difference
in
batches
some
batches
are
very
tastey
and
others
seem
watered
down
too
bad
because
when
you
get
a
good
batch
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
but
closer
to
a
medium
body
and
a
relatively
high
amount
of
carbonation
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
ill
buy
again
on
vacation
and
had
a
limited
selection
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
cheers
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
trough
the
evening
its
a
little
heavy
but
not
that
bad
where
you
can
only
drink
a
few
with
that
said
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
so
hats
off
to
my
fellow
brown
ale
friends
and
family
d
the
sweetness
would
keep
me
at
a
half
pint
on
the
reddish
side
of
brown
and
never
has
much
of
a
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
and
immediately
makes
me
think
of
malt
and
then
theres
faint
spice
somewhere
tastes
malty
as
expected
and
a
bit
nutty
with
a
good
balance
body
is
between
medium
and
substantial
if
not
for
the
small
metallic
undertone
this
would
be
very
pleasant
newcastle
seems
to
skunk
very
easily
especially
from
a
tap
at
bars
which
is
unfortunate
since
it
is
a
decent
choice
among
widely
available
beers
and
goes
well
with
food
pretty
drinkable
not
a
superstar
but
for
what
it
is
worth
a
try
and
not
disappointing
drinkability
is
not
bad
newcastle
is
quite
simply
a
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
brew
fills
a
niche
quite
nicely
i
see
people
ask
for
this
and
i
can
only
think
the
power
of
marketing
di
never
would
have
bought
this
on
my
own
but
a
friend
brought
this
over
to
a
picnic
so
i
gave
it
a
try
have
not
had
one
in
years
and
i
probably
dont
need
to
have
one
again
for
a
long
while
said
friend
poured
out
a
finely
crafted
ipa
to
quaff
this
when
it
arrived
and
i
was
a
bit
horrified
but
i
cant
fault
people
for
their
taste
this
one
just
isnt
mine
d
pretty
high
could
and
have
drank
several
of
these
in
one
session
when
nothing
better
is
available
that
said
i
wouldnt
buy
it
in
bottles
given
that
it
costs
about
the
same
as
much
better
micros
drinkability
an
average
english
brown
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
i
would
buy
several
others
in
the
style
first
not
overly
complex
and
a
little
too
grainy
i
will
pass
over
all
im
glad
i
only
paid
3
99
for
a
six
pack
of
this
sweet
malt
mild
caramel
toasty
in
the
back
end
and
ends
up
drying
but
not
bitter
it
lacks
the
complexity
i
prefer
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
too
highly
carbonated
and
overall
not
particularly
memorable
still
itll
do
in
a
pinch
drinkability
i
like
it
alot
for
a
session
goes
down
easy
and
the
sweetness
is
a
nice
addition
to
salty
snacks
with
low
abv
and
a
light
flavor
its
pretty
drinkable
but
i
would
love
to
try
a
better
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
was
better
than
most
bmc
but
im
not
likely
to
reorder
unless
there
was
nothing
else
but
bmc
to
order
im
into
craft
beer
and
i
really
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
try
good
but
not
great
would
order
it
again
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
d
a
decent
session
beer
however
i
like
a
little
more
flavor
in
my
beers
but
still
a
good
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
good
flavor
and
worth
the
money
to
upgrade
from
a
macro
d
way
easy
to
drink
d
not
a
bad
drop
relatively
easy
to
drink
a
better
example
of
the
brown
ale
style
but
hardly
the
pinnacle
the
color
is
really
nice
and
the
taste
is
good
enough
but
i
prefer
a
lot
of
other
beers
out
there
thats
probably
the
best
i
can
say
about
it
its
good
enough
i
would
compare
this
to
bass
ale
with
newcastle
having
a
slight
edge
overall
i
think
this
beer
would
appeal
to
the
majority
of
beer
drinkers
dvery
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
dthis
is
a
real
easy
drinker
straightforward
solid
and
reliable
it
may
not
be
anything
special
but
it
more
than
adequately
does
the
job
drinkability
is
great
when
cold
but
the
bitterness
peaks
when
the
beer
gets
warm
so
imbibe
cold
the
abv
is
nice
on
this
one
too
d
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
but
not
too
much
more
than
that
overall
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
full
taste
hey
what
can
i
say
this
was
a
good
excuse
to
use
my
newcastle
glass
an
industry
standard
and
its
easy
to
find
wherever
you
go
ive
found
myself
drinking
this
over
our
canadian
macros
when
i
have
no
other
alternative
in
many
of
our
lame
bars
around
calgary
the
taste
is
slightly
watery
with
a
sweet
roasted
barley
backbone
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
pleasant
and
easydrinking
brew
just
a
tad
stronger
than
an
english
mild
slightly
thin
bodied
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
and
always
worthy
of
a
drink
smooth
tasty
get
it
pours
a
true
translucent
brown
color
some
reddish
highlights
and
a
sturdy
lasting
brown
head
smells
of
nutty
brown
malts
and
a
fruity
yeast
strain
smooth
simple
and
malt
forward
with
very
little
bitterness
a
little
nutty
and
a
large
yeast
note
a
go
to
for
me
while
at
hockey
games
a
solid
brown
ale
time
after
time
overall
extremely
disappointed
by
this
due
to
the
multiple
rave
reviews
friends
gave
me
would
be
better
if
a
bit
stronger
the
malt
gets
me
first
its
the
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
what
i
imagine
is
some
kind
of
woody
nut
but
its
not
great
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
to
mention
carbonation
on
the
palate
is
low
its
perfectly
drinkable
its
just
boring
and
pointless
this
something
i
will
pick
up
when
on
sale
for
a
1
a
bottle
not
a
beer
i
crave
but
will
order
when
selections
are
limited
notes
like
i
said
with
the
drinkability
the
whole
beer
hits
me
differently
from
time
to
time
however
i
will
say
that
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
it
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
can
remember
drinking
a
few
of
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
but
overwhelming
nutty
and
malty
without
as
much
of
the
sweetness
that
would
give
this
some
balance
definitely
earthy
particularly
in
the
mouthfeel
and
the
brew
is
somewhat
drinkable
particularly
with
its
lower
abv
drinkability
for
all
of
the
cues
pointing
to
extraordinary
taste
such
as
the
aroma
and
rich
appearance
it
drinks
surprisingly
regular
its
not
bad
at
all
and
the
low
bitterness
character
appeals
to
me
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
taste
that
gives
any
lasting
impression
its
definitely
drinkable
though
if
slightly
boring
drinkability
something
you
might
want
after
working
in
the
yard
to
quench
your
thirst
one
of
my
favorite
beers
pours
nicely
but
with
a
reddish
brown
color
not
quite
brown
the
distinctive
odor
in
no
way
effects
the
taste
which
is
bold
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
enjoy
keeping
these
stocked
in
my
fridge
and
drinking
them
cold
d
a
very
nice
brown
ale
that
delivers
in
the
malt
and
nut
flavors
but
turbo
dog
is
still
my
nut
brown
of
choice
d
great
brown
ale
if
your
looking
for
a
great
session
ale
that
doesnt
overwhelm
your
palet
thin
head
barely
half
a
finger
of
creamy
white
foam
mostly
larger
bubbles
leading
to
a
quick
dissipation
minimal
lacing
strong
orange
tinge
lightens
the
brown
base
consistent
hue
largely
caused
by
overall
transparency
few
bubbles
to
be
seen
the
nose
is
semilight
with
sodabread
scone
caramel
and
orange
peel
most
noticeable
has
a
minerally
patina
ends
with
a
burst
of
green
hay
and
straw
if
it
can
said
to
have
a
burst
of
anything
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
flat
enough
to
keep
the
liquid
layered
on
the
tongue
like
sunscreen
before
you
shower
watery
as
in
mineral
water
cleansing
but
without
richness
of
flavor
the
caramel
and
toffee
actually
diminish
as
it
warms
hint
of
white
raisin
or
apricot
fruit
with
blanched
nuts
again
not
much
flavor
left
by
the
finish
just
metallic
astringency
and
pucker
nothing
horrible
but
it
is
amazing
how
you
can
outgrow
brews
like
this
d
not
a
bad
session
beer
has
some
decent
flavors
with
a
very
light
body
no
depth
or
complexity
though
real
easy
to
drink
in
its
simplicity
a
classic
light
brown
ale
that
is
very
enjoyable
on
tap
but
just
ok
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
a
great
fall
back
beer
at
any
bar
that
only
has
mass
produced
beers
and
this
beer
could
very
well
be
categorized
as
a
macrobrew
but
after
20
years
i
still
enjoy
a
newcastle
brown
ale
it
is
tough
to
review
a
beer
you
have
had
so
many
times
because
i
think
you
are
biases
for
or
against
it
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
pretty
average
if
you
ask
me
dark
color
makes
it
seem
like
it
would
have
more
flavor
but
is
actually
pretty
plain
and
nondescript
if
you
ask
me
there
isnt
much
of
anything
that
stands
out
about
it
except
for
the
label
and
brown
color
i
never
really
buy
or
order
it
anymore
because
ive
had
it
so
many
times
but
for
an
import
in
the
us
the
price
is
right
i
like
the
mildness
of
this
beer
nothing
is
especially
overpowering
the
malty
sweet
flavor
when
it
is
in
your
mouth
is
not
washed
away
by
an
overly
bitter
after
taste
it
is
not
a
heavy
feeling
beer
in
your
mouth
has
a
slight
nutty
smell
to
it
i
was
very
happy
when
my
favorite
bar
got
this
on
tap
as
it
seemed
like
the
bottled
version
was
somewhat
more
bitter
notes
seems
like
an
easy
to
drink
inoffensive
beer
that
is
made
for
mass
consumption
average
beer
that
may
be
a
good
stepping
stone
to
craft
beer
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
sweet
and
easy
drinking
mild
zing
up
front
leading
to
a
rye
bread
like
finish
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
fall
under
the
category
of
if
it
smells
bad
it
tastes
good
at
first
sniff
this
was
a
no
go
but
after
i
took
my
first
sip
it
was
wonderful
a
strong
taste
for
an
ale
with
an
attractive
appearance
recommended
if
you
like
the
britons
value
available
in
grocery
stores
and
even
some
gas
stations
but
at
a
pretty
steep
price
for
what
it
is
when
fresh
this
is
a
great
session
brew
i
could
and
have
easily
knock
back
several
of
these
mouthfeel
too
simplistic
to
enjoy
drinkability
too
expensive
to
be
drinkable
for
some
reason
the
thought
of
it
makes
me
feel
sicker
than
actually
drinking
the
beer
does
its
like
once
you
get
going
you
know
youre
gonna
make
it
but
beforehand
you
kind
of
have
this
gag
reflex
nerves
thing
acting
up
cheers
i
would
say
this
is
the
beer
that
kind
of
opened
the
door
for
me
once
again
in
a
bottle
i
dont
find
it
to
be
terrible
in
fact
i
find
it
awesome
i
enjoy
the
dark
brown
color
and
malty
scent
the
taste
has
little
to
no
hops
its
a
nutty
chocolate
caramel
flavor
has
a
smooth
taste
that
goes
down
clean
definitely
a
session
beer
overall
a
bit
of
a
letdown
but
certainly
easy
to
drink
sessionable
a
true
classic
allaround
d
very
drinkable
given
the
low
abv
i
am
sure
you
could
have
several
of
these
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
over
the
bottled
version
if
you
want
to
drink
this
beer
make
sure
you
get
the
draft
version
also
sometimes
the
brew
exhibited
a
poor
aftertaste
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
newcastle
brown
ale
i
was
expecting
something
with
more
flavor
but
this
came
up
rather
bland
at
best
its
average
i
will
say
however
that
id
be
willing
to
try
this
again
but
itd
have
to
be
from
a
can
or
on
tap
a
bottle
is
not
the
way
to
go
drinkability
it
fills
you
up
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
didnt
feel
like
i
needed
to
take
a
nap
after
2
of
these
and
a
big
sandwich
d
refreshing
easy
on
the
alcohol
the
bitter
aftertaste
would
grow
tiresome
and
keep
me
from
drinking
too
many
of
course
i
served
this
at
wine
cellar
temperature
5560
which
might
have
been
too
warm
i
will
drink
the
rest
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
ever
get
them
myself
i
need
to
get
something
off
my
chest
this
beer
is
so
frieken
horrendous
simply
because
i
belive
its
to
outlandish
and
sickening
sure
others
might
like
it
and
i
can
understand
why
its
not
bland
or
anything
like
that
by
far
the
worst
feature
of
this
beer
is
the
smell
and
taste
and
i
dare
any
of
you
to
drink
this
in
large
numbers
i
ussually
like
beers
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
somehow
they
have
managed
to
repulse
me
thanks
for
reading
and
publishing
my
review
of
the
few
brown
ales
i
have
tried
this
one
is
the
sweetest
i
have
had
nice
brown
color
small
head
that
all
but
disappears
quickly
smells
sweet
and
the
taste
that
goes
with
it
is
a
kind
of
burnt
toffee
flavor
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
so
proper
storage
is
a
must
d
the
light
texture
makes
it
easier
to
drink
than
other
darker
beers
but
it
feels
heavier
going
down
and
the
candy
flavor
gets
sickly
sweet
for
the
overall
effect
something
lighter
would
allow
for
drinking
more
beer
and
greater
drunkenness
something
heavier
would
allow
for
complexity
and
greater
enjoyment
nice
brown
color
with
little
head
smells
like
candy
to
me
really
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
pretty
sweet
we
can
also
taste
a
little
candy
goes
down
easily
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
afterall
i
believe
the
beer
i
had
was
light
struck
because
of
a
slight
spunkiness
the
bottle
being
clear
glass
does
not
help
matters
if
i
was
to
try
this
beer
again
i
would
get
it
in
a
can
or
from
a
tap
the
look
of
the
beer
was
expectedly
brown
and
clear
the
taste
was
more
defined
by
the
malt
than
the
hops
served
cold
this
beer
is
drinkable
d
very
well
balanced
these
go
down
smooth
and
quick
i
dont
prefer
them
but
newkies
provide
a
good
startpoint
for
anyone
wanting
to
explore
english
browns
poured
a
light
brown
thin
no
head
just
flat
as
can
be
not
impressed
nose
is
caramel
toffe
and
thats
about
it
taste
is
nutty
toffee
caramel
light
sweetness
and
crisp
hop
no
booze
at
all
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
good
as
well
this
beer
can
be
consumed
all
day
and
is
always
a
go
to
when
there
is
nothing
else
around
d
goes
down
smooth
could
drink
these
all
night
d
goes
down
smooth
sessionable
but
the
weak
flavor
could
be
a
turnoff
on
the
rightwrong
day
overall
though
i
would
still
take
this
over
a
macro
lager
any
day
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
especially
for
beers
that
i
would
tend
to
lump
with
newcastle
not
by
style
but
by
availability
relative
popularity
among
nonbeer
drinkers
like
stella
or
something
of
the
sort
smell
is
relatively
nonexistent
a
bit
of
brown
ale
maltiness
some
metallic
twinge
too
taste
isnt
terrible
some
raisin
notes
bready
notes
slightly
roasted
malt
and
maybe
a
few
offflavors
mf
is
thin
though
not
overcarbonated
like
most
macros
drinkability
is
high
in
that
it
goes
down
easily
though
not
the
most
interesting
beer
in
the
world
i
have
had
this
beer
both
out
of
a
bottle
and
on
tap
at
a
local
restaurant
being
impressed
every
time
i
do
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
heavier
beers
thats
drinkability
is
exceptional
but
this
beer
conquers
it
all
ill
take
one
of
these
over
almost
any
beer
i
have
ever
laid
eyes
on
very
very
exceptional
d
well
its
certainly
not
offensive
and
goes
down
easily
though
i
was
hoping
for
more
character
goose
islands
nut
brown
and
wychwoods
hobgoblin
are
much
better
to
style
this
is
drinkable
but
average
you
could
certainly
drink
plenty
but
i
doubt
you
cant
find
something
better
the
good
news
is
that
like
the
bottle
it
improves
quite
a
bit
on
tap
in
fact
i
would
suggest
that
this
only
be
drunk
from
the
tap
d
definitely
drinkable
d
sooo
smooth
especially
nice
with
my
powers
d
after
smell
the
aroma
the
taste
disappointed
me
a
little
homever
is
tasty
flavor
is
somewhat
bitter
throughout
and
when
it
comes
to
personal
opinion
i
would
prefer
more
of
a
malt
taste
in
a
beer
d
fine
for
a
free
beer
and
thats
why
i
choose
it
its
easy
to
find
all
over
vegas
and
tastes
way
better
than
heiny
speaking
of
that
is
this
really
an
ale
the
beer
looks
way
too
clear
to
be
an
ale
d
i
used
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
im
no
longer
sure
why
its
alright
in
the
flavor
department
but
nothing
spectacular
and
the
nose
is
quite
offputting
d
there
is
nothing
too
disagreeable
about
this
beer
it
is
just
soso
in
every
way
pretty
much
its
a
nice
smooth
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
more
of
it
the
only
time
i
have
this
stuff
is
when
someone
else
has
it
around
im
not
one
to
turn
down
free
beer
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brown
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
okay
i
dont
really
know
what
brits
think
about
it
but
i
suppose
its
like
any
other
beer
in
the
worldit
all
comes
down
to
personal
preference
personally
i
like
this
stuff
this
beer
is
such
a
cult
classic
and
i
have
no
idea
why
i
dislike
everything
about
this
beer
pretty
much
maybe
not
the
trivia
and
facts
they
put
on
the
bottle
but
as
for
the
beer
itself
well
it
blows
hard
the
first
english
brown
i
had
was
sam
smiths
and
i
have
never
gone
back
having
this
presented
as
a
brown
ale
is
laughable
the
only
beer
i
dislike
more
is
probably
boddingtons
the
body
was
not
dark
enough
there
was
head
minimal
the
nose
was
corny
with
a
touch
of
something
else
the
taste
was
lacking
the
most
fundamental
supports
for
the
style
the
onlything
i
could
taste
was
a
watered
down
biscuitmalt
flavour
this
is
just
a
beer
i
tend
to
avoid
when
i
see
it
at
gallery
openings
ill
take
highlife
at
least
that
one
is
being
honest
about
how
bad
it
is
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
ale
its
light
body
low
abv
and
its
not
over
bearing
flavor
make
it
very
easy
on
all
systems
damn
what
the
hell
happened
this
was
the
first
real
beer
i
ever
had
the
beer
that
started
my
love
of
brew
now
wtf
this
beer
sucks
side
note
newcastle
needs
to
stop
using
clear
bottles
i
had
to
go
through
alot
of
bad
bottles
that
have
been
light
struck
or
skunked
to
finally
find
a
good
one
very
little
head
develops
and
what
does
develop
does
not
last
but
a
few
seconds
color
is
dark
brown
kinda
what
you
would
expect
from
a
brown
ale
flavor
is
overly
watery
and
the
taste
is
mildly
nutty
with
subtle
hints
of
caramel
and
syrup
this
beer
rides
right
in
the
middle
of
mediocre
not
the
best
but
defiantly
one
of
my
favorites
conclusion
this
was
one
of
my
gateway
beers
and
i
loved
it
back
in
the
day
today
years
later
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
its
not
bad
but
somehow
the
dry
fruity
and
bitter
elements
just
dont
quite
work
together
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
some
people
love
this
brew
and
some
people
certainly
dont
i
do
happen
to
like
it
but
mostly
in
those
occasions
where
its
the
only
decent
thing
on
tap
among
the
bmc
and
more
popular
domestics
or
if
its
the
only
thing
decent
at
a
gas
station
that
i
wouldnt
mind
sipping
on
if
theyre
not
going
the
craft
or
micro
route
because
even
if
not
they
usually
have
newcastle
light
bodied
and
watery
its
easily
sippable
but
i
have
a
hard
time
getting
through
it
due
to
that
strange
taste
and
sugary
sweetness
its
not
horrible
but
its
not
really
that
goood
either
drinkability
is
above
average
but
not
as
good
as
it
would
be
for
a
beer
that
actually
has
a
good
flavor
drinkability
this
is
the
classic
english
brown
ale
for
a
reason
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
very
tasty
mouthfeeldrink
nice
carbonation
smooth
to
drink
may
be
better
drink
at
a
lower
serve
temperature
overall
i
was
suprised
by
how
much
i
liked
newcastle
it
had
been
awhile
since
the
last
time
i
consumed
one
and
was
really
impressed
by
the
taste
maybe
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
hopped
up
craft
beers
i
have
been
drinking
the
drinkability
on
it
is
pretty
average
becasue
of
its
heaviness
but
i
would
definitely
suggesting
trying
it
again
if
not
for
the
first
time
nice
brown
ale
light
carbonation
it
does
have
a
good
taste
and
i
have
found
myself
having
more
than
a
few
in
a
night
but
again
nothing
spectacular
so
when
i
go
to
buy
some
beer
i
usually
wont
be
coming
out
with
newcastle
because
i
can
expect
someone
else
to
always
have
some
and
i
can
grab
one
off
of
them
without
spending
the
cash
on
it
liquid
is
really
easy
on
the
tongue
and
the
subtle
scotch
flavor
at
the
end
feels
good
going
down
lacks
the
body
that
most
of
its
type
have
but
is
really
easy
to
enjoy
and
its
seriously
one
of
the
most
drinkable
brews
on
the
planet
drinkability
easy
but
the
smell
is
rather
offensive
drinkability
its
very
drinkable
for
sure
with
its
nonpalate
killing
flavour
creaminess
and
its
low
abv
but
would
i
really
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
this
hard
to
say
but
probably
not
certainly
not
after
tasting
anything
bolder
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
small
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
the
color
is
amber
and
clear
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
roasted
malt
with
spicy
hop
accents
the
taste
is
mainly
of
malt
with
a
little
bitterness
the
feel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
with
moderate
carbonation
its
very
drinkable
one
could
knock
a
few
of
these
back
for
an
enjoyable
evening
notes
i
was
enamored
with
this
beer
for
a
short
while
when
i
was
first
starting
to
become
interested
in
beer
i
know
now
that
its
not
the
end
all
and
be
all
for
english
brown
ales
however
as
a
cult
classic
of
sorts
it
could
be
a
lot
worse
o
not
my
beer
of
choice
but
gets
it
done
in
a
pinch
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
a
nice
even
brown
that
allows
light
to
glisten
through
and
glow
on
it
head
is
persistantly
thin
and
pale
taste
is
nutty
creamy
hoppy
sharp
swanky
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
good
as
well
despite
me
slamming
this
beer
here
its
actually
a
drinkable
session
brown
ale
its
better
than
an
adjunct
lager
but
its
not
as
good
as
a
well
made
craft
beer
be
careful
when
purchasing
this
beer
because
it
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
theres
nothing
stopping
the
light
from
affecting
your
newly
purchased
six
pack
cheers
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
really
goes
down
well
it
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
tried
and
it
a
really
session
beer
maybe
i
just
have
to
drink
it
more
often
theres
a
huge
difference
between
the
standard
german
beer
and
this
one
d
sigh
its
a
neverending
battle
with
eurobeers
in
clear
and
green
bottles
constant
fear
that
theyre
bad
and
my
paranoia
surfaces
once
again
with
this
beer
can
i
ever
get
one
im
confident
will
be
good
itd
drinkable
but
only
moderately
so
drinkability
decent
not
a
light
beer
but
not
too
boozy
i
could
definitely
go
for
another
glass
smell
of
light
malt
the
first
sip
was
the
same
as
the
smell
mostly
malt
i
did
notice
a
light
mouthfeel
and
the
distinctive
english
ale
bitterness
slightly
less
than
most
other
english
ales
my
evaluation
might
be
somewhat
clouded
by
my
long
affair
with
dog
when
i
was
a
lad
in
central
virginia
20
years
ago
it
was
one
of
the
few
british
imports
readily
available
throughout
the
region
it
pours
unimpressively
thin
lacing
it
tastes
like
just
about
any
other
macro
english
brown
ale
out
there
i
prefer
scotch
alesand
scotch

a
celt
dude
dont
jones
me
moderately
malty
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
solid
not
too
far
either
way
it
cannot
be
damned
nor
can
it
be
highly
praised
but
it
is
better
than
most
american
macros
has
a
cool
history
and
is
pretty
inexpensive
ill
go
finish
the
six
now
d
nice
and
smooth
the
aromas
leave
something
to
be
desired
and
the
taste
is
rather
plain
but
whats
there
is
good
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
a
respectable
brew
poured
from
a
clear
bottle
it
color
was
a
cllear
light
brown
lighter
and
clearer
than
most
browns
ive
had
the
smell
was
light
some
malt
caramel
and
breads
the
taste
was
the
same
not
alot
of
flavor
in
this
one
the
malt
was
light
tasted
very
little
hops
this
is
just
an
average
brew
just
not
alot
going
on
in
this
brown
not
recommended
so
many
other
browns
out
their
to
have
from
bells
dfh
big
sky
surly
it
has
a
nice
color
they
go
out
of
their
way
to
show
you
this
by
putting
it
in
clear
bottles
not
much
of
a
smell
compared
to
other
brown
ales
i
have
had
there
is
not
much
taste
or
flavor
people
who
arent
really
into
craft
beer
would
still
enjoy
a
few
ordered
at
a
restaurant
and
poured
into
a
fluted
pilsner
glass
very
dark
brown
body
with
a
reddish
rue
and
a
tan
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
aroma
of
clean
malt
and
a
slight
skunked
smell
mouthfeel
was
rather
thin
with
a
low
amount
of
sweetness
and
clean
finish
this
beer
is
easily
quaffable
but
lacks
in
the
flavor
department
a
pretty
drinkable
brown
ale
but
nothing
too
special
its
likable
because
its
a
solid
beer
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
i
just
dont
know
what
i
want
i
can
always
count
on
having
this
in
the
fridge
as
the
price
is
right
and
it
seems
to
fit
many
audiences
weak
to
strong
light
to
dark
cold
to
warm
it
works
for
almost
everyone
a
very
nice
middle
ground
poured
from
a
clear
12oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
some
malts
taste
is
refreshing
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
with
ease
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
i
think
youd
need
to
to
spice
it
up
by
drinking
other
things
could
see
it
becoming
plain
after
awhile
mouthfeel
full
bodied
heavier
than
most
with
a
syrupy
feel
smooth
with
little
courseness
low
carbonation
like
a
mild
ale
should
had
from
bottle
many
many
many
times
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
review
this
one
medium
to
light
brown
in
color
hedge
on
the
medium
side
smells
sweet
and
somewhat
caramely
taste
is
pronounced
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
nut
pretty
light
in
body
all
things
considered
an
excellent
goto
beer
this
beer
is
pretty
mild
and
it
feels
like
newcastle
just
wanted
to
make
a
marketable
and
drinkable
brown
ale
there
is
no
dominant
flavor
and
this
beer
is
subpar
nice
foam
aromas
seemed
tight
not
getting
anything
interesting
initial
flavors
somewhat
sweetmalty
but
had
no
finish
seemed
over
carbonated
better
than
mass
market
beers
but
not
in
the
craft
beer
league
it
did
get
better
the
warmer
it
got
forget
the
price
but
probably
wouldnt
get
again
drinkability
its
not
a
fantastic
or
memorable
beer
in
anyway
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
nice
substitute
to
heavier
beers
i
will
pick
this
up
again
and
give
her
a
gentle
pour
drinkability
goes
down
very
easy
however
not
much
flavor
and
that
strange
sweetness
so
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
another
one
really
i
consider
this
one
a
classic
even
though
it
isnt
the
most
complex
or
flavorful
brown
ale
it
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
deep
reddishamber
color
and
gives
a
creamy
white
head
there
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
but
the
taste
is
smooth
but
not
creamy
sweet
but
not
sugary
the
caramel
flavor
of
the
malts
is
nice
but
a
bit
onedimensional
overall
this
is
a
good
easydrinking
brown
that
isnt
full
of
flavor
but
satisfies
nonetheless
taste
very
crisp
and
clean
for
an
ale
could
use
a
little
more
sweetness
in
my
opinion
if
it
wasnt
for
the
little
bit
of
skunkiness
this
would
have
been
a
thuroughly
enjoyable
bottle
of
beer
cheers
only
ordered
it
because
it
was
the
best
choice
at
the
pub
i
was
at
overall
the
beer
is
smooth
but
fairly
simple
taste
wise
a
decent
drink
but
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
smell
and
taste
for
me
isnt
awesome
its
ok
i
guess
probably
wont
be
something
that
ill
stock
in
the
fridge
d
super
easy
session
brew
i
like
beer
this
beer
is
different
its
ok
wien
not
ice
cold
but
when
it
is
it
is
exeptional
smoth
easy
to
drink
and
ttasty
but
newcastle
brown
ale
has
a
bitter
after
taste
i
just
wanna
drink
another
and
smoke
a
cig
or
go
crest
my
teeth
i
guess
it
is
late
overall
good
not
bad
not
a
bad
beer
nor
a
great
beer
has
a
medium
brown
appearance
with
a
white
head
of
foam
has
a
smell
of
malts
and
sulfur
which
is
much
less
then
pleasant
taste
is
sort
of
sweet
but
lack
much
other
flavor
and
finishes
almost
like
mineral
water
the
beer
is
really
carbonated
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
turnoff
but
not
great
either
d
but
of
course
ill
drink
it
again
tis
a
great
beer
the
body
is
a
couple
steps
from
being
full
but
is
still
smooth
easy
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
superb
having
several
while
at
the
pub
with
your
mates
is
not
a
chore
overall
this
smooth
and
easy
classic
is
the
standard
for
the
style
review
from
tasting
notes
dated
12
aug
2009
drinkability
well
its
drinkable
for
sure
certainly
much
nicer
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
and
a
good
staple
beer
to
have
if
thats
the
best
thing
offered
at
any
particular
bar
or
restaurant
which
is
often
the
case
at
a
local
dive
nothing
too
exciting
though
but
decent
d
definitely
drinkable
but
i
am
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
if
i
saw
it
again
and
there
was
nothing
better
im
sure
id
have
another
go
at
it
especially
if
it
is
on
tap
brown
color
with
hints
of
red
and
a
small
head
with
poor
retention
not
a
lot
of
aroma
some
bitterness
at
first
followed
by
some
sweetness
as
the
beer
warmed
not
a
lot
of
flavorsome
malt
and
hops
but
neither
were
very
assertive
same
as
with
the
aroma
the
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
decent
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
reddish
brown
in
color
in
a
clear
bottle
so
you
get
what
you
see
fair
head
that
doesnt
last
but
leaves
a
collar
while
beer
lasts
not
very
aromatic
had
a
crisp
medicinal
taste
slightly
malty
as
an
aftertaste
good
carbonation
that
leaves
a
little
bite
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
very
drinkable
a
poor
mans
speckled
hen
in
taste
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
its
smooth
and
refreshing
it
would
work
well
with
or
without
food
on
a
warm
or
cool
day
something
i
could
definitely
drink
again
its
not
as
bad
as
my
review
sounds
as
its
a
drinkable
session
beer
its
certainly
better
than
the
most
popular
beers
in
america
bmc
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
most
micro
brown
ales
drinkabilty
this
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
to
me
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
but
would
defiantly
prefer
this
over
any
one
of
the
big
3
goes
down
somewhat
smooth
all
in
all
while
it
wasnt
great
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
average
in
every
way
no
head
but
decent
enough
taste
i
only
drank
this
because
a
friend
of
newcastle
gave
it
to
me
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
it
might
spice
up
the
flavor
a
bit
not
something
i
could
drink
for
long
though
a
couple
wont
hurt
d
a
smooth
well
balanced
beer
thats
refreshing
ill
buy
it
again
drinkabilty
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
imo
has
the
balance
between
flavour
and
mildness
perfectly
i
know
it
may
seem
sacrilegious
to
some
but
mixing
this
beer
in
a
glass
with
an
ipa
that
lacks
a
sufficient
malt
backbone
is
a
tasty
combo
to
me
and
if
i
should
ever
happen
to
purchase
a
pack
of
this
ale
again
i
imagine
that
i
will
mix
it
again
between
light
and
medium
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
not
the
best
english
brown
but
still
easy
to
put
away
i
quite
like
newcastle
brown
ale
it
is
a
good
beer
not
a
great
one
very
easy
to
drink
and
something
you
can
enjoy
without
thinking
about
it
too
deeply
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend
who
moved
thanks
meredith
and
i
dont
refuse
free
beer
i
think
the
more
ive
drank
the
more
its
grown
on
me
but
overall
i
dont
really
like
this
beer
somethign
in
the
flavor
just
doesnt
taste
very
good
to
me
i
guess
the
malty
roasty
flavors
i
personally
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
and
a
little
fresher
and
see
how
much
better
it
is
i
think
it
being
an
import
and
in
clear
glass
it
could
be
alot
better
than
how
i
got
it
but
for
my
bottle
review
i
say
its
just
ok
overall
this
is
my
first
newcastle
from
a
can
while
there
have
been
many
great
brown
ales
since
then
newcastle
will
hold
a
special
place
due
to
it
being
one
of
the
gateway
beers
that
piqued
my
interest
in
drinking
better
beer
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
that
i
have
to
have
it
but
its
one
of
those
beers
that
still
has
its
time
and
place

have

to
try
a

of
brown

find

i

i
feel

starts

this

an

really
hit
this
one
out

on
all
counts
looks
tastes
stylewise
very
tasty
brew
here
a
pretty
tasty

beer
not
too
sweet
yet
packed
with
excellent
caramel
and
nut
flavors
not
bad
a
brown
ale
that
slides
down
nicely
despite
being
a
tad
old
it
seems
alright
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
dominated
by
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
which
make
for
easy
drinking
somewhat
undercarbonated
but
otherwise
ok
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
served
on
tap
in
a
duvel

appearance
is

with
no

passage
a
cm
of
tan
head
and
thick

features
mellow
roast
and
caramel
malt
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
mild
with
a
watered
down
roasted
malt
profile
and
a
slightly
nutty
character
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
brown
roasted
almonds
dont
pair
as
well
as
one
would
expect
but
dark
chocolate
does
so
do
peanut
butter
and
bananas
well
the
beer
wasnt
all
that
fascinating
however
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
i
will
be
keeping
the
bottle
growing
up
listening
to
ska
makes
me
appreciate
every
beer
this
brewery
makes
whether
it
be
hit
or
miss
so
far
this
is
really
the
first
miss
wow
just
read
a
few
reviews
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
beer
it
looked
good
and
was
not
skunked
at
all
ill
have
to
get
another
one
and
rereview
overall
this
beer
has
its
ups
and
downs
but
its
alright
too
sticky
and
definitely
not
good
on
a
hot
summer
night
o
a
good
easy
to
drink
nut
brown
slightly
above
average
example
of
the
style
o
good
but
not
great
obviously
a
steal
for
the
price
dark
brown
in
color
the
head
is
tan
and
retention
is
very
little
lacing
is
scattered
unevenly
around
the
glass
lightly
toasted
malts
take
stage
with
a
faint
hop
bitterness
the
nose
ends
on
a
sweet
almond
like
nutty
note
light
roasted
grains
dominate
the
taste
but
are
balanced
out
nicely
by
bitter
hop
characters
and
a
sort
of
sourness
in
the
middle
once
again
the
taste
finishes
nutty
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
with
fine
carbonation
a
fairly
average
brown
ale
its
got
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
interested
if
i
could
find
this
in
singles
in
my
area
i
could
see
purchasing
a
couple
now
and
then
although
i
would
never
drop
the
cash
for
a
six
pack
worth
a
try
a
solid
english
ale
from
ska
brewing
but
a
far
cry
from
veterans
of
the
style
such
as
samuel
smiths
the
real
problem
is
that
the
beer
just
didnt
come
off
as
rich
creamy
and
complex
as
some
other
english
browns
plus
the
art
on
the
bottle
kinda
creeped
me
out
i
might
have
this
again
on
tap
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
but
i
dont
see
myself
picking
up
a
six
of
it
anytime
soon
nothing
special
here
pours
a
cocacola
colored
brown
with
a
small
off

head
which
fades
away
to

two
smells

and
medium
roasty
caramel
malts
dominate
flavor
is
rather
bland
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
much
of
that
roasted
character
comes
through
from
the
smell
no
hops
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
fuller
bodied
and
kind
of
filling
with
a
little
less
carbonation
than
maybe
it
could
have
leaves
a
funny
aftertaste
too
overall
definitely
not
one
of
skas
better
beers
ive
come
to
expect
more
from
them
still
a
sessionable
brown
ale
that
would
pass
muster
in
a
lot
of
other
states
but
it
doesnt
cut
it
here
in
colorado
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
with
a
minimum
amount
of
head
which
dissipated
rather
quickly
nice
warm
brown
color
but
a
lighter
brown
the
smell
of
roasted
nut
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
nose
medium
bodied
feel
in
the
mouth
nice
smooth
malty
flavor
with
a
bit
of
a
lingering
aftertaste
very
nice
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
been
looking
for
a
nice
solid
brown
to
be
a
mainstay
in
the
bar
this
is
a
keeper
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
by
12712
a
couple
of
weeks
past
date
this
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
sized
foamy
white
head
the
smells
are
of
brown
sugar
a
little
nuttiness
other
malts
the
feel
is
medium
taste
is
brown
sugar
nuttiness
some
roasted
malts
not
bad
pours
brown
with
very
little
head
sweet
swell
to
this
thing
but
nothing
distinct
in
the
aroma
taste
is
pretty
flat
and
i
get
very
little
distinguishable
flavors
from
it
maybe
a
blend
of
brown
sugar
and
malt
i
think
i
might
have
to
buy
another
single
of
this
in
the
future
to
ensure
i
simply
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
of
this
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
very
little
carbonation
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
so
far
i
will
have
to
give
it
a
second
chance
though
reading
a
lot
of
these
comments
suggest
something
wasnt
right
for
me
here
maybe
a
wrong
time
wrong
place
situation
maybe
an
old
bottle
that
sat
on
the
rack
for
too
long
who
know
4
on
christmas
is
the
buster
nut
brown
from
ska
the
colors
is
a
nice
brownish
clear
amber
with
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
lacing
the
scent
includes
malt
maple
sugar
and
some
nuttyness
the
taste
includes
a
good
push
of
sweet
molasis
type
malt
with
hints
of
peanut
butter
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
lighter
in
body
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
i
think
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
body
overall
this
was
a
solid
english
brown
ale
slightly
more
hops
than
in
some
of
the
others
ive
had
but
its
just
a
hint
and
melts
away
into
the
big
caramel
and
malt
finish
definitely
tasty
and
worth
a
try
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
brew
this
is
a
tasty
enough
beer
buster
nut
is
far
from
being
a
world
class
brown
ale
its
just
a
bit
light
all
the
way
around
that
said
theres
no
major
missteps
here
props
to
ska
for
making
a
nice
easy
drinking
quaff
nuts
galore
and
even
goes
so
far
as
to
remind
me
of
a
hazelnut
liqueur
not
quite
frangelico
in
its
richness
and
sweetness
though
toffee
and
coffee
are
secondary
flavors
but
still
there
nonetheless
hops
are
very
low
and
its
hard
to
distinguish
any
yeast
character
the
body
is
fine
and
leans
a
bit
toward
the
sweet
end
of
the
spectrum
its
quite
baffling
ive
had
at
least
twelve
of
these
over
the
past
couple
years
and
the
components
all
add
up
to
something
i
would
really
like
but
for
some
reason
it
just
doesnt
all
come
together
perfectly
for
me
this
was
my
fourth
bottle
of
a
sixpack
i
started
to
review
the
first
but
held
judgment
until
i
was
sure
sadly
all
four
bottles
had
the
same
results
i
wont
share
this
with
my
friends
and
im
too
tight
to
pour
the
last
two
down
the
drain
the
beer
looks
good
but
seems
to
have
been
rushed
out
the
door
m
nothing
stood
out
abt
the
mouthfeel
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
little
bit
of
nuttyness
mixed
in
straight
forward
but
enjoyable
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
there
is
a
little
bit
of
brown
sugar
to
go
along
with
the
hazelnut
toffee
and
caramel
notes
there
is
a
little
bit
of
grass
from
the
hops
but
it
is
hidden
well
behind
the
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
picked
up
in
a
pick
your
own
six
pack
so
only
one
to
sample
pours
d
dark
brown
with
fair
head
and
moderate
carbonation
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
it
does
have
a
distinct
nut
flavor
overall
a
pretty
good
nut
brown
not
the
best
offering
from
ska
but
a
good
not
great
beer
revised
with
bottle
consumed
in
june
2013
overall
while
it
is
true
this
brown
ale
is
pretty
straight
forward
it
does
at
least
go
for
a
more
original
interpretation
of
a
brown
ale
that
roasted
flavor
could
even
be
called
endearing
if
it
was
done
better
the
malt
profiles
are
just
too
small
you
could
do
worse
for
browns
im
sure
but
ultimately
you
could
also
do
much
much
better
mvery
good
doesnt
kill
your
palate
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
overall
impression
a
light
refreshing
mild
brown
that
didnt
have
much
characteristic
after
the
nose
liked
it
but
ska
has
much
better
brews
than
this
would
recommend
for
some
people
trying
to
get
into
new
craft
beers
and
need
a
lighter
brown
ale
buster
nut
pours
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
and
deep
copper
coming
through
the
head
is
fairly
light
in
color
and
sticky
it
slowly
gives
way
to
a
few
spots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
rich
full
of
caramel
toasted
walnuts
and
hazelnuts
and
hints
of
both
bread
and
chocolate
on
the
first
sip
you
know
youll
be
wanting
more
than
one
pint
of
this
brew
this
is
definitely
a
nutty
brown
ale
with
tastes
of
both
chocolate
and
coffee
with
hints
of
pumpernickel
bread
hints
of
hops
come
through
on
the
flavor
but
dont
linger
long
enough
to
be
distinguishable
this
beer
is
very
carbonated
and
that
masks
the
flavor
slightly
but
thankfully
the
flavors
continue
to
develop
and
grow
stronger
as
you
drink
it
a
nutty
aroma
lingers
with
you
after
each
sip
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
heavier
side
of
light
adequate
carbonation
i
found
this
very
drinkable
pleasant
with
the
low
abv
a
session
english
brown
not
many
around
from
us
brewers
worth
a
try
overall
really
very
well
done
wetting
to
the
palate
nice
carbonation
and
a
spicy
snap
with
a
powdery
finsh
light
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
an
inch
of
tan
foam
that
left
nice
lacing
and
good
retention
very
nice
looking
beer
the
aromas
were
sweet
grainy
malts
and
a
slight
nuttiness
the
flavor
is
sweet
at
first
then
the
roasted
malt
and
nut
flavors
come
forward
dry
clean
finish
crispness
keeps
the
sweetness
from
being
too
sugary
the
body
is
medium
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
brew
2
5
d
certainly
worse
that
average
they
need
to
throw
in
some
more
malt
and
mash
a
lot
higher
too
light
and
watery
to
appreciate
there
isnt
a
strong
smell
but
light
sweetness
and
malt
is
detectable
pours
brown
and
has
very
little
head
and
lacing
i
taste
brown
sugar
and
there
is
a
nice
crispness
it
is
pretty
sweet
there
is
some
bitterness
but
it
finishes
nicely
this
is
a
well
rounded
brown
ale
with
a
medium
body
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
fast
dimishing
head
and
thin
lacing
scents
of
some
robust
malts
and
nutty
hints
drinks
rather
lightly
for
being
a
dark
beer
rather
mild
roasted
malts
taste
with
an
awkward
nutty
finsh
the
way
you
expect
this
beer
to
taste
and
the
way
it
actually
tastes
are
two
different
things
not
completly
horrible
but
definetly
needs
some
work
on
its
taste
and
texture
d
really
easy
drinking
this
isnt
always
my
favorite
style
but
ska
does
a
decent
enough
job
with
it
i
like
the
nutty
flavor
but
it
does
become
a
tad
wearing
after
a
while
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
brown
with
a
thin
diminishing
khaki
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
mild
brown
malts
and
cocoa
the
taste
is
a
smooth
subtle
blend
of
dark
malts
cocoa
nuts
and
mild
caramel
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
and
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
surprisingly
enjoyable
brown
ale
one
i
would
love
to
have
ontap
again
drinkability
i
have
to
admit
this
brown
is
really
drinkable
as
its
quite
good
there
are
nice
flavors
that
really
live
up
to
the
name
on
the
label
moderate
abv
and
a
body
that
isnt
too
heavy
hell
i
think
id
be
able
to
get
through
2
or
3
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
i
had
to
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
carbonation
as
the
lack
of
carbonation
imparts
a
bit
of
a
watery
feel
pours
a
clear
brown
color
64
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
nut
slight
wheat
slight
grain
and
slight
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
english
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
yeast
slight
grain
slight
nut
slight
wheat
and
a
hint
of
hops
overall
good
appearance
and
complexity
but
average
aroma
and
body
poured
a
leather
couch
brown
w
2finger
head
that
quickly
receeds
and
left
no
lace
on
top
of
a
faint
aroma
of
burnt
sweet
malts
and
sour
hop
bitterness
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
light
and
quaint
as
there
isnt
much
going
into
this
light
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
w
slight
roasted
edge
and
a
hint
of
hops
lead
to
dryness
and
breadiness
an
alright
brown
ale
that
was
nice
to
have
on
a
summer
day
it
pours
a
bit
too
light
and
clear
for
my
standard
of
a
brown
toasted
nuts
and
grains
in
the
aroma
im
having
to
reach
to
smell
it
the
body
and
flavor
are
a
little
richer
than
i
expected
after
the
lackluster
aroma
as
it
warms
up
caramel
malts
and
an
undefined
nuttiness
bring
forth
a
charming
quality
and
a
gentle
hoppiness
can
be
found
in
a
dryish
finish
probably
more
of
an
intro
brown
in
my
book
d
solid
nut
brown
ale
not
the
most
common
style
in
the
craft
brewers
repertoire
so
it
was
nice
to
see
another
good
ale
from
ska
i
would
not
buy
this
again
i
dont
care
if
i
paid
less
than
2
for
this
bottle
it
is
not
worth
it
in
the
least
i
would
rather
pay
double
the
price
for
something
far
more
enjoyable
than
try
this
beer
hopefully
future
brown
ales
can
bring
my
spirits
back
up
to
what
they
used
to
be
before
i
was
dashed
by
the
angry
mod
suited
man
and
his
army
of
crazed
bottles
final
words
great
choice
for
a
lighter
bodied
full
flavored
brown
ale
drinkability
i
have
had
better
but
this
is
a
good
beer
none
the
less
drinkability
easy
drinker
plain
and
simple
and
the
head
retention
is
good
as
is
the
lacing
a
good
beer
overall
pours
from
the
bottle
a
nice
light
to
medium
brown
with
a
good
light
brown
head
aromas
of
nuts
sweet
malt
and
milk
chocolate
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
flavors
of
cocoa
powder
and
brown
sugar
a
solid
sweet
nut
brown
ale
nothing
more
nothing
less
d
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
low
abv
makes
it
a
good
session
beer
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
it
served
in
a
dillon
dam
shaker
pint

light

a
says
the
flavor
is
like
a
dark
brewed
iced
tea
i
disagree
moderate
caramel
nuttiness
a
little
more
bitter
than
expected
slight
nuttiness
in
the
finish
moderately
bittersweet
aftertaste
d
not
a
bad
brown
ale
but
not
a
great
brown
ale
either
too
watery
for
my
tastes
d
a
decent
offering
from
a
company
just
now
available
in
the
midwest
but
would
still
prefer
a
modus
hoperandi
any
day
d
this
is
an
excellent
if
not
exactly
outstanding
brown
ale
i
like
the
sweet
caramel
and
maple
syrup
notes
and
the
hops
and
woody
notes
are
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
overly
saccharine
thanks
ken
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
nut
brown
that
i
would
have
again
the
nut
is
not
too
overpowering
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
d
this
is
an
okay
brown
okay
it
really
didnt
have
the
nutty
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
expect
in
an
english
brown
ale
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
nose
has
bready
malts
nuts
and
molasses
taste
has
toffee
molasses
and
bready
malts
light
to
medium
body
has
average
carbonation
finish
is
a
bit
thin
not
a
bad
brown
ale
just
nothing
special
decent
session
beer
d
nice
light
beer
with
some
roasty
notes
very
drinkable
has
some
nice
stuff
going
on
but
is
not
too
cluttered
drinkability
brown
ale
is
a
tough
style
to
get
excited
about
but
some
brewers
manage
to
add
something
to
it
to
make
it
interesting
sky
unfortunately
does
not
drinkability
high
no
alcohol
detected
smooth
brown
ale
on
the
thin
side
good
flavor
good
nose
just
not
my
style
overall
impression
there
are
some
good
flavors
but
something
overall
doesnt
work
its
not
bad
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
d
i
wouldnt
reach
for
a
second
one
if
something
else
is
available
but
not
painful
to
get
through
glad
to
see
more
of
skas
beers
finding
their
way
to
my
neck
of
the
woods
i
like
this
beer
and
could
drink
these
often
and
regularly
if
only
i
could
buy
this
in
missouri
the
aroma
is
dusty
and
papery
with
hints
of
malt
toffee
and
hops
the
appearance
is
light
brown
with
a
huge
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
sourness
the
palate
is
thin
but
ok
overall
this
is
a
true
buster
i
wonder
what
they
were
going
for
this
is
not
what
a
brown
ale
should
be
d
drinkable
yes
but
many
other
with
more
heft
and
flavor
with
equal
drinkability
are
out
there
this
beer
didnt
do
me
much
good
keep
the
esters
and
faint
alcohol
out
of
the
flavor
and
dont
forget
to
pep
the
carbonation
level
then
we
have
a
much
more
enjoyable
beverage
here
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
one
that
i
probably
wont
revisit
again
this
is
not
bad
at
all
sadly
i
had
to
drink
five
bad
ones
to
get
it
this
would
be
a
nice
go
to
session
brew
in
the
consistency
were
upheld

i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
and
trying
even
more
from
ska
its
near
my
hometown
so
i
am
looking
forward
to
going
home
for
christmas
this
year
off
the
tap
at

in

poured
into
the

so
slightly
hazy
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
two
fingers
of
tan
head
good
lacing
and
good
retention
great
looking
overall
the
aromas
were
sweet
malt
dry
grains
and
a
nuttiness
the
flavors
were
sweet
at
first
then
the
bready
malt
and
nut
flavors
chestnut
kick
in
dry
finish
as
the
sweet
malt
fades
out
the
body
is
medium
to
light
and
perhaps
just
a
bit
watery
but
the
carbonation
is
good
and
it
lends
itself
to
being
quaffable
a
good
session
brew
snifter
rich

of
molasses
great
flavors
sweet
at
first
but
a
dropoff
in
the
end
mostly
molasses
and
chestnuts
medium
to
low
body
light
to
mild
carbonation
level
smooth
and
creamy
very
wellbalanced
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
this
is
some
decent
brown
it
goes
down
easy
just
short
of
creamy
and
is
just
so
mellow
that
it
seems
like
it
would
go
with
so
many
things
i
can
see
this
as
a
good
session
brew
if
your
into
browns
check
this
one
out
pretty
good
superb
drinkability
and
flavor
place
this
beer
among
my
favorites
from
ska
the
drink
is
crisp
and
refreshing
very
middleoftheroad
needs
to
be
a
bit
more
aggressive
i
only
wish
i
could
visit
the
taproom
to
see
how
things
went
down
there
d
not
a
bad
brown
ale
and
one
that
i
can
easily
drink
buster
nut
brown
ale
has
a
pretty
cool
label
reminds
me
of
some
punk
rock
albums
from
the
mid
90s
think
mighty
mighty
bosstones
or
reel
big
fish
looks
great
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
weak
head
smell
is
good
has
a
very
strong
chocolately
malty
aroma
taste
is
very
coffee
like
has
a
nice
sugary
malty
flavor
no
hop
presence
at
all
mouthfeel
is
kinda
watery
good
beer
all
around
comes
across
almost
like
chilled
coco
an
interesting
and
fun
beer
should
work
great
for
breakfast
great
lloking
beer
except
for
the
insane
overflw
of
head
after
a
very
light
pour
but
the
crazy
light
beige
head
does
hld
up
well
throughout
all
twelve
ounces
medium
brown
with
ok
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
moldy
very
malty
bready
arom
with
just
a
hint
of
mold
ust
a
hint
though
so
it
doesnt
make
wanna
dump
the
bre
especially
if
youve
had
a
couple
of
lambics
under
your
belt
the
taste
is
a
bit
old
tasting
bread
with
lots
of
toast
and
medium
roasted
malts
the
palate
is
smooth
yet
musty
it
is
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
poured
a
cola
brown
with
overwhelming
carbonation
that
required
multiple
pours
and
patience
to
finally
get
12
oz
into
a
pint
head
was
a
dark
tan
with
a
meringuelike
texture
after
a
few
pours
into
the
glass
aroma
was
biscuity
with
just
a
hint
of
dark
malt
no
hops
to
speak
of
flavor
was
a
typical
brown
without
the
sweetness
common
to
the
style
this
emphasized
the
hop
bitterness
and
the
dark
malt
and
was
responsible
for
the
lighter
mouthfeel
that
other
reviewers
noted
this
was
a
pleasant
change
for
someone
who
prefers
drier
beers
so
if
you
are
a
little
put
off
by
the
sweetness
in
most
browns
this
beer
may
be
the
way
for
you
to
better
enjoy
this
style
very
sessionable
some
more
chewiness
would
have
gone
a
long
way
to
improve
this
beer
for
me
not
terrible
but
in
the
end
i
was
defintley
expecting
a
little
more
overall
its
an
easy
to
drink
brown
and
isnt
by
any
stretch
a
bad
beer
still
in
a
crowded
pack
this
doesnt
do
much
to
differentiate
itself
i
have
had
this
brew
before
in
passing
at
a
local
bar
and
was
not
impressed
found
a
sixer
for
5
99
and
figured
what
the
hell
i
like
it
better
than
i
did
before
now
that
im
less
intoxicated
but
overall
i
will
not
buy
this
one
again
when
there
are
nice
hobgoblin
ales
to
be
had
drinkability
easy
to
drink
session
ale
this
will
not
blow
you
out
of
the
water
but
a
worthy
beer
to
try
drinkability
ill
tell
you
what
it
was
surprisingly
nice
at
least
ontap
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
again
the
carbonation
gets
in
the
way
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
certainly
drinkable
these
ska
folks
havent
really
wowed
me
with
anything
but
their
brews
are
certainly
drinkable
and
session
worthy
this
has
received
subpar
reviews
here
but
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
beer
yet
i
prefer
a
newcastle
this
beer
is
a
nice
deep
brown
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
smell
is
slightly
rancid
deffinatly
thw
low
point
of
this
beer
the
taste
really
aint
too
bad
caramel
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
the
beer
has
no
bad
aftertaste
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
mid
range
for
the
style
way
to
thin
one
and
done
with
this
bad
boy
overall
a
pretty
thin
and
boring
nut
brown
overall
an
inoffensive
but
average
nut
brown
nothing
unpleasant
here
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
either
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
beer
is
kind
of
unspectacular
but
not
unpleasant
if
this
beer
is
to
live
up
to
its
awesome
appearance
and
awesome
name
it
needs
to
be
much
more
robust
in
all
departments
especially
mouthfeel
the
smell
is
alright
fairly
nutty
with
a
bit
of
a
malty
sweetness
and
some
subtle
fruity
esters
the
taste
is
the
same
very
watery
i
suppose
it
would
make
a
decent
session
ale
but
i
know
of
many
more
that
i
would
love
to
drink
in
place
of
this
ska
brewing
companys
buster
nut
brown
ale
i
keep
wanting
to
call
it
nut
buster
a
name
that
would
be
more
appropriate
if
it
was
bigger
and
better
is
an
decent
version
although
i
cant
bring
myself
to
recommend
it
more
malt
is
the
obvious
fix
as
is
cast
your
brown
ale
lovin
eyes
elsewhere
an
excellent
example
of
its
style
and
a
great
introduction
to
the
ska
brewery
if
only
it
didnt
have
such
a
horrible
name
im
far
from
a
prude
or
anythingi
just
dont
like
to
be
reminded
of
semen
while
im
trying
to
savor
the
flavor
of
something
is
all
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
nutty
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
light
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
weak
with
some
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
but
just
not
the
best
nut
brown
the
aroma
suggests
lots
of
malt
flavor
but
the
actual
taste
is
a
let
down
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
d
im
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
because
they
are
usually
bland
and
shallow
this
one
has
good
grain
qualities
and
complexity
that
give
it
lots
of
depth
in
the
flavor
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
hops
or
other
grain
in
the
finish
but
it
was
very
nice
to
drink
deep
brown
in
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
the
head
leaves
a
clumpy
lace
on
the
glass
as
it
settles
the
nose
has
some
toffee
figs
hazelnuts
and
a
little
nectarine
the
flavor
has
milk
chocolate
more
hazelnuts
nectarine
not
much
bitterness
the
flavor
is
a
little
jumbled
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
drinkability
is
only
average
in
this
beer
overall
average
there
wasnt
anything
that
makes
want
recommend
or
tell
you
not
to
try
it
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
i
would
suggest
that
you
try
it
for
your
self
pours

finishes
on
the
sweet
side

with
a

above
the
dark

head
fades
very
slowly
with
areas
of
frothy

aroma
is
minimally
of
effervescent
malts
i
expect
some
sort
of
nuttiness
from
a
nut
brown
taste
is
lightly
nutty
but
other
than
than
little
character
to
note
mouthfeel
seems
quite
thin
with
drinkability
being
a
bit
better
but
overall
not
much
redeeming
here
lots
better
brews
in
the
cooler
found
this
very
drinkable
but
made
thirstier
for
something
heavier
this
is
a
cola
colored
brew
that
poured
a
small
head
and
is
leaving
some
lacing
nose
is
slight
hint
of
toasted

and
chocolate
taste
is
not
overly
complex
a
combination
of
tasted
malts
and
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
not
overly
lively
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
nut
brown
style
but
this
has
a
taste
that
is
pretty
good
the
beer
emigrates
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
somewhat
hazy
brown
with
a
portly
light
tan
head
that
is
semicreamy
in
texture
as
it
fades
away
the
lace
forms
a
concealing
blanket
upon
the
glass
nose
is
malt
with
light
caramel
tones
fresh
and
somewhat
tobacco
like
start
is
lightly
sweet
and
the
malt
profile
light
to
moderate
with
the
top
light
in
its
feel
finish
is
mildly
acidic
the
hops
benign
in
their
spiciness
somewhat
sour
aftertaste
is
also
dry
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
real
hit
with
me
tiny
bit
of
hops
noted
in
the
short
finish
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
this
is
a
pleasant
nut
brown
ale
i
like
the
chocolate
minerals
and
grain
husk
though
its
a
touch
thin
bodied
on
a
side
note
their
busy
labels
annoy
me
i
can
hardly
tell
what
the
freakin
beer
is
get
it

this
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby

color
with
a
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
roasted
notes
biscuits
caramel
and
even
perhaps
a
hint
of
cherry
fruitiness
the
body
of
this
beer
is
light
actually
a
bit
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
malty
sweetness
lightly
roasted
barley
notes
and
a
cherry
like
fruitiness
there
is
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
and
it
does
have
a
nice
mix
of
fresh
flavors
but
it
is
a
bit
thin
and
it
is
missing
a
little
something
pours
a
mediumish
brown
with
red
highlights
a
nice
tan
head
leaves
light
lacing
aroma
is
toasted
malt
and
a
good
nutty
smell
with
some

also
taste
is

lightly
sweet
to
start
then
nutty
notes
come
to
the
front
it
finishes
with
light
fruity
hop
flavor
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
really
great
going
on
either
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
with
drinkability
being
good
they
go
down
easy
enough
it
is
just
lacking

to
push
it

the
good

poured

dark

it

a
very
nice
roasted

aroma
with
chocolate
and
coffee
mixed
in
almost
like

the

sweetish

comes

not
really
carbonated
not
something
that
i
will
order
more
than

damnit
if

done
drink
one
on

around

just
a

on
this
one
and
the
roast
was
a

too
over

however
solid
and
a
great

smell
is
rich
like
fresh
toast
and
cereal
this
is
super
sessionable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
on
a
nice
fall
day
pours
bright
dark
amber
just
a
hint
of
light
gets
through
malty
nose
some
caramel
bready
and
nutty
maple
malt
taste
thin
light
carbonation
a
little
sweet
nice
balance
with
the
maple
and
the
nut
brown
flavors
good
autumn
beer
admittedly
i
waited
too
long
to
enjoy
this
year
overall
meh
seems
like
the
base
beer
wouldnt
be
too
bad
but
the
nitro
just
kills
it
o
ill
look
for
this
again
this
season
o
i
know
rating
long
trail
beers
lower
is
the
cool
thing
to
do
but
its
current
rating
is
criminal
this
is
a
quintessential
autumn
beer
and
is
disrespected
delicious
and
perfect
for
the
season
i
love
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
fall
releases
brown
ale
brewed
with
maple
syrup
just
right
for
a
chilly
adirondack
evening
deep
brown
to
red
on
the
pour
a
faint
caramel
glow
in
the
light
and
an
inch
of
khaki
colored
head
with
decent
retention
that
produces
ring
lacing
each
sip
nose
is
caramel
malt
based
with
a
hint
of
dry
cocoa
and
an
unmistakable
maple
sweetness
the
sugar
contrasts
with
the
almost
bitter
malt
really
well
in
the
flavor
as
the
rich
grains
drive
the
flavor
until
the
finish
where
a
warm
maple
vanilla
complex
gently
rounds
out
the
taste
its
not
overly
sweet
and
as
such
a
real
drinkable
a
sixer
of
this
is
no
problem
medium
bodied
for
a
brown
and
carbonated
just
enough
this
is
a
patient
beer
through
too
and
improves
as
it
warms
a
little
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
long
trail
and
its
beers
like
this
that
make
fall
my
favorite
season
to
be
a
beer
lover
chewy
tasty
pub
style
in
a
bottle
creamy
slight
vanilla
wash
full
taste
not
much
to
say
other
than
id
get
this
one
again
its
a
standard
brown
overall
an
alright
beer
overall
but
nothing
to
shout
home
about
overall
decent
brew
i
belive
that
the
nutty
characteristics
of
the
beer
reflect
the
maple
syrup
making
for
a
more
subtle
flavor
i
would
have
this
one
again
the
taste
has
the
slightest
bite
right
away
with
a
nutty
albeit
soapy
malt
character
at
first
that
perks
up
a
tad
with
the
slow
hop
finish
pretty
easy
drinking
the
flavor
is
good
with
nice
toasted
grain
and
honey
type
sweetness
with
a
light
herbal
element
with
nice
caramel
and
light
corn
pop
elements
with
slight
biscuit
in
the
finish
overall
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
get
it
again
it
has
nice
flavor
and
is
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
low
abv
and
i
like
the
honey
in
this
as
it
adds
to
the
dry
body
solid
not
must
have
o
its
just
as
i
remembered
it
and
makes
me
glad
i
got
some
this
year
this
is
very
drinkable
in
fact
ill
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
this
is
probably
one
of
most
drinkable
browns
on
the
market
o
part
of
the
sampler
pack
the
price
on
this
is
great
i
find
this
a
slight
downgrade
from
a
sam
adams
but
a
solid
beer
from
a
decent
brewery
o
a
nice
version
of
the
style
had
all
the
flavors
that
i
was
anticipating
the
coffee
bite
was
a
nice
surprise
but
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
thickness
in
the
taste
seems
a
little
watered
down
but
overall
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
this
is
light
to
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
soft
i
like
this
one
its
nothing
special
but
im
apt
to
buy
it
again
as
it
is
a
solid
brown
ale
from
a
solid
brewery
at
a
reasonable
price
theres
obviously
a
large
difference
between
the
reviews
of
this
beer
posted
by
regular
users
and
those
posted
by
the
bros
according
to
the
one
bro
review
the
reviewed
bottle
apparently
contained
a
blurb
about
using
17
different
malt
and
hop
varieties
however
a
quick
check
of
long
trails
website
reveals
only
five
malt
and
hop
varieties
tworow
wheat
amber
nugget
and
mt
hood
im
not
sure
if
the
recipe
changed
or
if
a
review
was
posted
incorrectly
nicely
done
should
be
a
crowd
pleaser
normally
i
prefer
more
substantial
beers
but
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
it
had
good
clarity
to
it
along
with
a
nice
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
gave
off
some
autumn
spice
along
with
some
roasted
nutty
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
wasnt
too
bad
either
it
had
a
semisweet
roasted
quality
to
it
along
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
on
the
lighter
side
even
for
a
darker
brew
the
carbonation
wasnt
too
overpowering
and
the
finish
had
a
light
tingle
to
it
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
pours
a
transparent
brown
with
white
head
that
fades
aroma
of
toffee
light
brown
sugar
and
slight
nutty
tastes
of
toffee
light
brown
sugar
subtle
cola
and
light
cinnamon
nutty
and
caramel
towards
the
finish
medium
carbonation
with
light
body
had
an
opportunity
to
have
this
beer
the
past
two
years
while
vacationing
in
vermont
we
went
to
long
trail
and
they
had
this
and
all
of
their
beers
on
tap
the
color
was
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
sweet
smell
the
taste
was
amazing
it
finishes
off
with
a
subtle
hint
of
maple
syrup
i
have
had
this
in
bottles
we
brought
home
a
case
and
it
is
very
good
from
the
bottle
too
if
you
get
up
there
go
to
the
brewing
company
and
taste
it
all
the
good
night
irene
was
even
better
the
always
solid
long
trail
makes
a
great
fall
seasonal
here
note

self
ranked
42

top
english
brown
ales
when
i
tried
it
oi
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
wasnt
going
in
expecting
much
and
found
the
beer
enjoyable
wont
say
id
get
it
again
but
was
worth
a
try
o
not
bad
not
great
theres
a
lot
of
brown
ales
out
there
id
drink
before
grabbin
another
ltbc
harvest
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
o
pretty
decent
beer
could
use
a
little
less
carbonation
and
heavier
flavor
pretty
good
fall
beer
though
overall
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
taste
is
very
well
balanced
and
isnt
very
filling
another
solid
beer
from
long
trail
highly
recommended
to
malt
lovers
o
this
beer
is
pretty
dull
i
like
to
give
extra
points
to
beer
with
abv
below
5
but
a
higher
abv
might
have
helped
here
overall
a
more
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
very
drinkable
but
not
much
out
of
the
ordinary
good
brew
the
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
probably
the
star
of
the
variety
pack
right
now
not
to
say
any
of
the
others
are
bad
moreys
bottom
line
id
happily
sip
on
this
again
but
the
money
wont
be
coming
out
of
my
wallet
as
there
are
many
superior
options
as
far
as
fall
seasonals
go
id
like
to
see
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
maple
syrup
in
the
one
o
damn
long
trail
i
expected
a
good
competitive
brown
ale
and
this
is
what
i
get
watery
and
tastes
strange
your
good
vs
bad
beer
record
is
now
23
i
want
to
like
you
since
youre
a
new
england
staple
but
youre
going
to
need
to
do
better
than
this
this
beer
pours
a
clear
coke
brown
with
bold
orange
in
the
light
no
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
nuts
with
dark
roasted
malt
the
flavor
has
notes
of
burnt
toast
nuts
and
a
hint
of
root
beer
leading
to
a
roasted
nut
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
long
trail
harvest
is
a
good
beer
perfect
for
a
fall
evening
recommended
i
am
a
big
fan
of
long
trail
double
bag
ale
and
ipa
while
this
beer
is
good
it
is
not
in
the
same
league
it
is
very
drinkable
i
buy
this
beer
every
season
and
im
never
let
down
this
is
one
well
balanced
brown
ale
recommended
deep
reddishbrown
color
nutty
slightly
smoky
nose
that
also
has
a
hint
of
the
maple
syrup
used
this
beer
really
smells
like
autumn
to
me
crisp
wellbalanced
taste
dominated
by
fresh
malt
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
has
some
complexity
to
it
no
fireworks
but
this
is
really
pleasant
stuff
for
a
fall
day
pours
a
slight
white
head
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
dark
deep
rich
colour
nutty
on
the
palate
almondy
mouthfeel
only
problem
is
a
bit
watery
body
a
bit
thin
but
you
can
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
one
sitting
very
smooth
nothing
offensive
crisp
and
brisk
a
good
fall
beer
would
be
even
better
with
some
hazelnuts
nothing
to
shy
away
from
but
nothing
overly
special
either
i
think
however
pretty
good
stab
at
the
style
into
a
pint
glass
on
81411
this
yields
a
crimson
brownish
color
under
a
well
kept
white
head
a
moderate
aroma
carries
notes
of
sweet
toasted
nut
malt
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
vanilla
cream
or
lactate
a
crisp
and
mild
toasted
malt
background
quenches
the
palate
with
notes
of
mild
coffee
roasted
nut
and
toffee
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
that
really
does
express
its
flavors
best
nearest
a
cellar
temperature
lighter
than
most
brown
ales
and
less
flavorful
but
would
be
pretty
refreshing
when
you
arent
craving
something
real
complex
i
typically
like
more
flavor
than
this
and
in
comparison
to
other
brown
ales
it
feels
a
little
underwhelming
overall
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
rather
sessionable
especially
with
its
low
alcohol
content
had
this
on
tap
at
pony
bar
in
new
york
city
pours
a
light
brown
colour
with
almost
no
head
or
lacing
smells
of
caramel
nutty
and
a
mild
hint
of
some
hops
sweet
flavour
with
some
mild
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
quite
thin
for
the
style
just
an
ok
brown
ale
taste
is
high
on
malts
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
pretty
light
easy
to
drink
and
mouthfeel
is
good
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
the
medium
body
with
the
light
carbonation
makes
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
i
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
all
the
flavors
work
very
well
together
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
surprised
me
i
did
not
expect
to
like
this
so
much
one
of
the
best
harvest
beers
ive
sampled
this
season
excellent
medium
bodied
beer
totally
sessionable
very
drinkable
m
as
said
its
a
bit
thin
not
too
bad
if
you
want
a
lighter
beer
notes
i
first
had
this
on
tap
but
this
one
is
from
a
bottle
i
decided
to
pick
some
up
and
the
verdict
is
dam
tasty
cheers
long
trail
harvest
ale
is
an
okay
brown
ale
after
drinking
a
mild
stout
having
this
beer
was
like
drinking
nothing
the
roast
and
toasted
flavors
seemed
pretty
muted
the
color
was
nice
and
there
was
alittle
head
stand
but
beer
didnt
have
the
richness
and
chocolately
flavor
that
i
was
expecting
in
the
new
tradition
of
bold
flavorful
browns
this
falls
short
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
lack
of
substance
in
the
mouth
and
the
abv
is
relatively
low
would
be
a
good
quenching
beer
after
some
leaf
raking
this
drinks
really
nice
i
might
not
buy
this
again
but
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
some
more
of
it
this
was
the
best
in
the
variety
12
the
blackberry
wheat
was
a
close
second
however
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
and
i
could
gladly
drink
if
offered
one
but
if
i
have
to
go
out
myself
and
spend
8
00
on
a
six
pack
then
im
taking
something
a
little
more
special
i
would
say
this
would
be
the
taste
if
you
took
a
good
brown
ale
and
cut
it
with
water
i
poured
this
awful
beverage
from
a
bottle
into
my
mouth
you
could
taste
the
nasty
rubbing
alcohol
that
vermont
has
to
offer
since
on
the
bottle
they
use
local
vermont
ingredients
the
only
thing
i
could
think
taste
worse
is
the
longtrail
unfiltered
iap
very
very
bad
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
very
little
head
it
smells
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
very
watery
at
first
but
then
finishes
with
a
malty
flavor
that
is
very
sweet
a
very
different
taste
for
a
brown
ale
flavor
is
weak
and
lower
carbonation
but
this
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
brown
ale
for
the
light
beer
drinker
overall
not
bad
i
was
expecting
and
hopeing
for
a
stronger
flavor
though
but
unquie
flavor
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
large
head
that
hangs
on
for
awhile
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
and
nutty
with
a
hint
of
roast
underneath
a
little
lighter
tasting
than
what
i
expected
slightly
fruity
and
buttery
with
some
nuttiness
in
the
finish
the
flavor
seems
to
be
dominated
by
the
yeast
definately
more
enlish
than
american
in
nature
the
body
is
also
on
the
light
side
but
it
is
enough
to
carry
the
flavor
and
has
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
brown
ale
that
has
a
reasonable
abv
for
a
session
not
bad
at
all
certainly
a
sessionable
ale
db
i
am
a
bit
torn
here
i
really
enjoy
the
roasty
nutty
malt
but
the
adjunct
seeming
fruit
and
corn
flavors
throw
it
off
somewhat
it
just
feels
light
and
a
tad
artificial
but
still
not
bad
d
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
on
a
cool
autumn
day
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
this
will
be
a
go
to
fall
brew
for
me
this
has
nice
toasty
flavors
but
its
watery
and
thin
you
lose
everthing
on
the
finish
this
harvest
beer
doesnt
feel
that
bountiful
a
bit
thin
for
a
fall
beer
but
nonetheless
drinkable
and
goes
down
easy
compared
to
other
brewerys
fall
specials
this
one
isnt
one
id
run
back
to
but
if
someone
offers
me
up
one
im
not
going
to
say
no
its
just
average
for
me
while
i
little
too
green
tasting
at
first
this
actually
balanced
out
nicely
as
it
warmed
and
the
earthy
hop
character
coupled
with
the
easy
feeling
body
made
for
a
decent
thirst
quenching
experience
nothing
mindblowing
here
but
this
was
a
decent
drinking
brown
ale
for
the
fall
season
very
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
enjoyable
for
the
season
and
the
reasonable
price
tag
but
there
are
no
strong
dominant
flavors
i
expect
more
in
my
beer
and
from
long
trail
to
be
honest
relatively
balanced
but
light
for
a
brown
ale
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
fall
brown
ale
i
still
like
the
sierra
nevada
tumbler
more
mainly
because
it
has
more
of
a
hop
bite
to
it
i
hope
long
trail
makes
a
pumpkin
ale
some
fall
drinkability
for
me
is
just
ok
have
had
much
better
autumn
beers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slick
and
a
bit
thin
on
the
finish
not
my
favorite
offering
from
long
trail
drinkable
probably
better
with
food
that
would
make
it
more
drinkable
this
beer
needs
more
roasted
malts
and
should
be
brown
or
a
deep
amber
if
is
going
to
be
a
brown
ale
could
also
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
help
keep
the
head
afloat

out
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
beige
or
offwhite
colored
head
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
turns
out
to
be
more
of
an
amber
red
color
it
has
good
clarity
to
it
well
filtered
the
head
goes
away
after
a
few
sips
and
leaves
a
ring
with
a
little
layer
of
foam
over
the
middle
small
random
patches
of
lacing
that
seem
to
try
to
work
its
way
down
to
the
liquid
the
smell
is
very
good
it
smells
very
well
hopped
pine
and
floral
notes
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
department
much
sweeter
than
anticipated
can
clearly
taste
some
roasted
caramelized
malts
there
are
also
a
slight
chocolate
taste
to
it
more
like
coco
very
interesting
only
a
slight
hop
aftertaste
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
the
smell
thats
for
sure
theres
also
a
smokey
taste
to
it
probably
some
roastedburned
malts
involved
with
the
flavor
its
a
very
complex
taste
but
quite
good
the
mouthfeel
is
good
despite
the
complex
flavor
id
still
call
it
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
closer
to
the
lighter
side
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
and
another
solid
brew
by
long
trail
still
havent
decided
whether
or
not
im
going
to
pick
up
another
six
pack
this
season
because
there
are
so
many
seasonals
i
like
this
time
of
year
if
not
than
i
have
something
to
look
forward
to
next
year
on
a
side
note
i
really
enjoyed
the
label
on
the
bottle
the
husband
and
wife
farmer
bears
really
make
me
think
of
the
fallharvest
season
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
long
trail
offering
as
i
do
most
of
their
seasoanal
offerings
this
beer
features
a
huge
dose
of
malty
goodness
to
get
you
through
those
cold
fall
months
very
balanced
all
around
with
the
huge
malt
backbone
being
the
star
of
the
show
at
4
7
abv
this
beer
drinks
bigger
then
the
abv
indicates
huge
drinkability
here
i
think
ill
have
another
served
in
a
nonic
poured
the
color
of
cola
with
some
cranberry
juice
highlights
at
the
base
when
backlit
no
head
on
this
one
nose
was
mild
some
dark
malts
and
wheat
but
thats
all
im
getting
taste
not
much
in
that
department
either
malt
some
caramel
notes
but
fairly
bland
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
with
a
light
background
effervescence
almost
flat
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
very
bland
i
actually
struggled
to
finish
this
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
better
off
the
keg
than
from
the
bottle
but
i
was
pretty
disappointed
this
beer
is
easy
enough
to
drink
and
will
probably
taste
better
after
the
first
bottle
cheers
drinkability
this
was
an
interesting
offering
and
the
flavor
profile
is
different
from
other
harvest
ales
easy
to
quaff
really
great
autumn
session
perfect
autumn
session
beer
i
can
already
imagine
the
leaves
and
that
autumn
smell
in
the
air
poured
a
clear
dark

very
thick
moderate
sized
bubble
off

supported
by
high
carbonation
moderate

low

moderate
carmel
brown

flavor
that
is
slightly
cloying
in
the
sweetness
moderate
body
with
low
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
some
low
level
spiciness
at
the
very
end
not
really
sure
why
this
is
under
american
amber
red
ale
it
calls
itself
a
brown
and
i
think
it
fits
very
well
in
to
the
american
brown
ale
category
call
it
what
you
want
i
call
it
superb
d
seems
pretty
drinkable
no
strong
flavors
relatively
balanced
clean
for
a
brown
ale
low
abv
big
and
smooth
malty
and
thick
but
not
too
much
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
smokey
camping
type
flavor
to
it
a
tinge
of
bitterness
to
it
a
very
solid
fall
beer
poured
a
reddish
amber
hue
with
light
white

leaves
quickly
with
minimal

left
behind
aroma
has
some
sweet
cereal

a
touch
of

with
a
pretty
much
absent

nose
taste
has
caramel
malts
with
heavy
cereal
rains
somewhat
of
an
herbal
hop
finish
very
light
on
flavor
finishes
semisweet
i
was
excpecting
a
lot
more
sweetness
than
was
actually
there
just
from
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
with
even
carbonation
nothing
too
interesting
here
drinkability
all
around
a
session
seasonal
that
i
could
pass
on
next
time
and
not
feel
bad
about
it
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
aroma
is
nutty
with
light
brown
sugar
and
cocao
powder
taste
is
similiar
very
clean
brown
sugar
in
front
but
has
a
nutty
herbal
hop
finish
which
makes
for
a
soapy
swallow
carbonation
is
a
bit
higher
than
id
like
long
trail
harvest
is
nice
and
malty
this
year
the
dark
grain
stands
out
this
year
more
than
it
has
in
the
past
2
years
i
am
not
sure
if
they
use
the
same
recipe
every
year
now
or
not
this
year
seems
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
the
story
of
the
the
beer
is
that
they
use
what
they
have
left
over
to
make
it
so
i
am
under
the
impression
that
they
use
or
try
a
different
grain
bill
each
year
because
it
is
a
tad
bit
different
every
year
overall
this
years
batch
has
a
chocolate
maltiness
that
stands
out
a
well
balanced
brown
ale
i
remember
this
beer
being
better
earlier
this
decade
however
it
has
fallen
flat
on
its
face
nice
brown
color
but
a
little
lacking
in
the
nose
taste
was
your
classic
brown
ale
flavor
but
it
leaves
the
palate
quickly
and
the
best
way
to
describe
is
watered
down
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
seasonal
try
elsewhere
sampled
at
the
2009
flower
city
brewers
fest
at
frontier
field
rochester
ny
poured
out
of
a
bottle
very
dark
brown
ale
light
brown
finger
thick
head
smell
insinuates
a
heavier
beer
until
you
drink
it
then
its
just
kinda
bleh
very
light
mouthfeel
nothing
outstanding
would
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
whos
stepping
into
falloktoberfest
beers
and
doesnt
want
an
in
your
face
flavor
right
away
kinda
boring
but
easy
to
drink
dark
but
clear
ruby
red
with
an
inch
of
quickly
dropping
foam
nose
is
malt
and
fruit
slight
bandaid
and
caramel
in
the

as
well
flavour
is
dark
fruit
and
caramel
with
a
decent
hop
bitterness
somewhat
raw
on
the
tongue
with
a
sharp
carbonation
and
dryness
but
a
bit
of
husky
grain
keeps
things
in
check
odd
tonguenumbing
anise
flavour
medium
body
is
unremarkable
earthy
taste
with
tart

not
real

not
offensive
good
balance
nice
tangyness
leading
into

light
bodied
and
smooth
to
the
finish
wish
i
could
have
tried
this
a
few
months
ago
like
i
planned
will
have
to
pick
more
up
next
year
thanks
for
reading
drinkability
not
a
bad
red
ale
but
not
one
that
jumps
out
i
could
session
this
beer
just
as
easily
as
i
could
pass
over
it
pours
a
glowing
orange
amber
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
leaving
next
to
no
sticking
subtle
nose
of
clean
quality
malts
semisweet
with
good
lively
carbonation
roasty
and
just
nutty
enough
with
an
earthy
slightly
leafy
hop
note
going
on
by
itself
very
quietly
i
remember
previous
years
showing
a
bigger
texture
and
having
more
body
with
lower
carbonation
still
damn
good
and
damn
drinkable
nonetheless
drinkability
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
pours
a
very
good
looking
dark
copper
semilarge
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
intermittent
lacing
very
good
looking
beer
smells
a
bit
sweet
like
candy
cinnamon
but
the
aroma
overall
is
weak
and
very
laid
back
the
second
the
beer
hits
my
lips
i
can
tell
that
the
palate
will
please
me
smooth
creamy
texture
with
a
very
nice
tingling
carbonation
this
brew
doesnt
do
anything
too
special
but
its
adequate
in
all
areas
and
very
enjoyable
as
a
fall
seasonal
notes
on
the
whole
a
pretty
decent
seasonal
brew
it
should
be
noted
that
a
biscuity
and
toffee
aroma
as
well
as
flavor
become
more
evident
as
the
sample
warmed
i
had
picked
up
a
12pack
a
bit
ago
and
have
just
gotten
round
to
reviewing
it
i
honestly
thought
it
was
a
brown
ale
the
first
few
times
i
had
it
since
it
mirrors
one
in
certain
aspects
anyway
a
nice
sessionable
brew
for
the
autumn
to
winter
season
that
tastes
decent
and
wont
break
the
bank
d
not
one
id
pursue
again
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
too
bad
i
picked
up
a
single
pours
auburn
or
redish
amber
with
a
decent
quickly
diminishing
head
vague
aroma
of
nut
and
malt
body
is
light
smooth
with
a
abrupt
bitter
end
like
drinking
water
with
a
mildly
good
smell
and
an
aftertaste
not
impressed
but
i
rarely
am
with
ambers
oh
well
clear
brown
to
slightly
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
and
just
a
halo
of
foam
no
lace
smell
is
biscuit
maltyness
with
some
nice
nuttyness
the
nuttyness
really
comes
to
the
front
in
the
taste
for
me
also
some
toastyness
and
some
maple
syrup
notes
in
the
taste
thin
mouth
overall
i
would
rate
this
as
just
an
average
beer
at
best
nothing
to
get
excited
about
pours
a
clear
brown
with
next
to
nil
head
no
lacing
to
mention
the
aroma
smells
of
light
toffee
caramel
and
a
touch
of
hop
spice
flavor
is
very
thin
notes
of
some
toffee
and
caramel
maybe
a
bit
of
cocoa
peaks
through
in
the
front
but
fades
off
very
quickly
to
not
much
of
a
flavor
at
all
thin
mouthfeel
watery
not
much
carbonation
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
body
is
light
mildly
carbonated
but
a
touch
chalky
and
dry
drinkable
yes
but
im
not
sure
what
it
would
go
well
with
pours
a
mahogany
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
of
little
bubbles
that
dissipate
down
to
a
thin
line
that
lasts
throughout
minimal
lacing
toasted
and
carmelized
malt
chocolate
in
the
aroma
lots
of
biscuity
toasted
flavor
caramel
chocolate
tea
like
hop
quality
comes
through
with
a
strong
malty
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
this
is
a
crisp
clean
drinking
beer
great
seasonal
offering
light
and
drinkable
but
flavor
leaves
something
to
be
desired
slightly
sweet
and
nutty
but
disappears
rather
quickly
had
this
on
tap
poured
an
almost
clear
reddish
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
very
little
lacing
aroma
was
that
of
roasted
malt
with
what
i
thought
was
a
hint
of
coffee
carbonation
was
good
throughout
taste
to
me
was
malty
hazelnut
i
hate
hazelnut
i
cannot
stand
the
taste
and
the
smell
of
it
since
i
hate
it
i
can
say
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
i
know
it
has
received
some
good
reviews
but
im
sorry
i
just
didnt
enjoy
it
i
would
probably
try
it
again
i
was
drinking
a
few
ofests
before
i
had
this
maybe
that
had
an
effect
on
my
taste
buds
mdim
not
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
one
bit
its
watery
thin
and
flavorstealing
just
too
slick
for
me
as
a
session
beer
it
would
be
decent
though
with
so
much
forgettable
in
the
second
half
of
the
tasting
spectrum
youd
do
better
with
a
decent
lager
or
mild
or
bitter
speaking
of
which
the
website
said
this
is
based
on
an
english
brown
style
but
it
looks
like
an
american
amber
whats
the
deal
i
dont
mind
crossover
styles
but
when
the
brewery
tells
you
its
one
thing
then
goes
on
and
on
about
all
the
malt
varieties
and
organic
local
ingredients
it
gets
kind
of
confusing
a
better
feel
for
backbone
and
not
promo
would
have
improved
this
brew

also

to

oxidized
side
to
boot
not

impressed
with
this
one
ended
up
as
a
drain
pour
d
it
was
a
fine
beer
but
one
without

suitable

session
beer
but
definitely
a
second
choice
if
another
is
available
dont
drink
and
review
d
a
seesaw
affair
with
the
nose
but
comes
back
strong
with
the
taste

complex
than
i
expected
and
look
foward
to
having
on

lightmedium

smooth

drinkability
as
the
beer
is

solid
session
brew
bad
batch
warmedupcooled
down
too
much
between
the
brewery
and
my
casa
and
what
about
all
the
folks
that
really
liked
it
it
wasnt
offensive
but
the
complete
lack
of
interesting
smellflavortaste
was
sure
a
bummer
a
mystery
to
me
md
i
felt
this
one
was
slightly
overcarbonated
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
in
the
future
it
just
seemed
almost
bland
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
long
trail
this
is
a
fairly
light
bodied
brown
ale
that
is
very
smooth
clean
and
well
balanced
toasted
sweet
malts
brown
sugar
maybe
even
maple
syrup
in
the
taste
with
a
nice
bready
background
the
hops
are
present
and
complement
the
more
malty
body
of
this
beer
but
they
ought
to
have
come
on
a
touch
more
strongly
there
is
modest
carbonation
which
is
just
right
this
is
a
very
smooth
eminently
drinkable
brown
ale
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
sweet
from
the
maple
syrup
andor
brown
sugars
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
mild
very
worthy
selection
lchaim
average
brown
ale
with
some
standout
malty
characteristics
dpretty
good
i
could
definitely
kick
pack
and
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
note
seems
to
actually
be
better
in
bottled
format
who
knew
more
well
rounded
and
better
feel
definately
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
just
enough
lively
fine
textured
carbonation
to
lighten
up
the
mouthfeel
velvety
and
very
clean
pleasant
and
lingering
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
with
a
low
abv
and
a
taste
thats
hard
to
get
tired
of
really
exceptional
and
a
fantastic
way
to
ring
in
the
fall
a
nice
seasonal
beer
right
here
from
a
good
brewery
the
best
part
about
it
is
the
appearance
as
its
a
nice
hearty
fall
color
lacking
a
little
bit
on
the
smell
but
the
taste
has
all
the
usual
fall
spices
in
these
seasonals
very
drinkable
and
balanced
with
a
nice
body
to
it
along
with
the
lack
of
smell
theres
also
a
lack
of
carbonation
i
thought
which
would
have
improved
the
score
good
overall
though
once
you
taste
it
though
youll
be
a
believer
it
is
a
slightly
sweet
brown
ale
with
a
subtle
caramel
flavor
behind
the
more
prevalent
taste
of
vermont
grown
hops
its
quite
simple
in
character
but
this
simplicity
and
balance
are
its
greatest
strengths
it
has
a
medium
body
and
terrific
mouthfeel
i
had
a
hard
time
not
drinking
the
entire
six
pack
all
at
once
this
is
really
a
phenomenal
beer
from
a
great
little
brewery
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
it
dont
pass
it
up
you
wont
regret
it
drinkability
modestly
drinkable
if
i
had
to
dnot
really
sure
about
the
harvest
ale
moniker
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
from
long
trail
a
brewery
i
have
never
been
overly
impressed
with
this
is
a
drinkable
session
brew
that
has
enough
going
on
to
hold
my
interest
wouldnt
mind
having
a
bit
more
in
the
aroma
to
make
it
more
enjoyable
d
just
like
pancakes
nothing
altogether
outstanding
but
utterly
satisfying
not
bad
d
pretty
safe
red
ale
thats
easy
to
drink
as
most
typically
are
nothing
stands
out
really
this
is
simply
your
typical
malty
seasonal
for
consumption
during
the
autumn
months
this
beer
is
a
great
representation
of
fall
and
harvest
lots
of
tastes
in
this
that
remind
one
of
the
season
notes
over
all
its
very
good
but
i
would
like
it
to
have
a
little
bit
deeper
more
assertive
flavor
this
beer
is
hard
to
review
they
claim
that
they
have
17
different
varieties
of
hops
and
malt
in
the
brew
poured
a
nice
dark
brownamber
color
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
adequate
amount
of
lace
but
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
a
lot
the
aroma
is
hard
to
detect
its
malty
and
maybe
a
little
woody
as
well
as
grainy
the
flavor
is
not
as
rich
as
the
look
more
malty
than
hoppy
but
both
are
there
the
finish
is
slightly
hoppy
and
dry
very
smooth
beer
but
this
is
hard
to
judge
maybe
its
something
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
pours
a
clean
copper
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
malt
sweet
lager
like
notes
and
a
very
small
hop
in
the
taste
small
hop
and
a
roasty
malt
quite
balanced
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
malty
and
small
hop
in
the
aftertaste
light
for
a
harvest
somewhat
lager
like
in
the
aroma
balanced
and
decent
session
poured
out
of
the
bottle
a
pleasant
clear
copper
brown
with
a
cream
colored
head
little
retention
but
some
intermittent
lacing
smells
of
wood
and
caramel
malts
flavors
are
a
little
spicy
mostly
malt
hops
seems
lacking
a
little
nutty
and
toffee
or
caramel
definitely
fallish
decent
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
finish
is
a
little
tangy
when
the
hops
finally
show
up
a
mediocre
beer
the
carbonation
is
tough
to
get
past
for
me
but
the
taste
and
smell
are
worth
the
bubbles
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
while
camping
or
tailgating
d
average
at
best
drinkability
finishes
dry
but
lacks
the
sweetness
per
style
drinks
more
like
a
standard
ale
then
an
amber
spicy
and
woody
quaff
with
more
of
those
roasted
nuts
tossed
into
the
barrel
this
one
slides
easily
and
would
make
for
a
nice
summer
session
brew
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
or
medium
brown
in
color
with
about
a
one
finger
beige
head
with
some
decent
lacing
slight
caramel
and
malt
nose
toasted
biscuit
with
a
slight
caramel
dry
taste
mouthfeel
mostly
malt
medium
body
and
carbonation
ok
drinkability
is
good
but
its
not
special
by
any
means
very
drinkable
due
to
nice
body
and
very
mild
flavors
pours
a
crystal
clear
brown
with
minimal
crème
head
nose
is
unusual
a
part
of
me
wants
to
say
it
smells
like
the
butter
that
amasses
in
those
bags
of
microwave
popcorn
i
take
a
more
observant
whiff
and
it
seems
like
those
danish
cookies
you
always
get
in
the
cans
at
christmas
time
apparently
i
am
all
about
the
snacks
today
flavor
is
tangy
and
a
bit
too
much
so
has
some
hearty
and
earthy
aspects
but
that
zing
just
overpowers
it
too
much
i
say
good
feel
but
a
bit
thin
overall
this
is
decent
at
best
i
have
to
say
well
made
yes
but
the
almost
citric
tang
that
yells
a
bit
too
loud
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
and
ends
up
killing
the
experience
good
but
not
my
favorite
long
trail
brew
i
had
a
few
but
the
beer
never
really
grew
on
me
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
id
recommend
ahead
of
this
one
but
its
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
visit
the
brewery
sample
at
the
mill
hill
saloon
in
trenton
nj
this
beer
is
a
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
fruit
and
caramel
malt
mediumbodied
with
sweet
malt
and
caramel
flavors
along
with
some
nuts
and
hops
the
finish
is
moderately
sweet
at
first
with
a
mild
hops
aftertaste
drinkable
although
mediocre
overall
drinkability
a
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
d
i
could
session
this
beer
if
i
chose
to
smooth
but
dry
and
with
a
sweetbitter
bite
major
yeast
full
of
flavor
like
an
oktoberfest
combined
with
an
esb
really
great
final
note
the
farmer
bears
on
the
bottle
label
were
cute
but
there
wasnt
a
label
cuteness
catagory
in
the
review
agressive
pour
lead
to
a
two
finger
head
that
is
a
off
whiteeggshell
color
very
clear
amber
bodylooks
like
every
other
amber
ale
small
amounts
of
lacing
caramel
maltssmall
amount
of
fruitiness
in
the
smell
i
taste
some
fruitberrys
chocolatecaramel
and
some
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
wateryonce
the
taste
leaves
your
mouth
its
gone
clean
taste
i
dont
think
i
will
have
any
of
these
long
trail
beers
again
they
werent
too
great
sorry
fellas
poured
a
a
healthy
hearty
color
a
dark
brown
that
looked
like
stained
wood
plus
a
rich
creamy
head
the
smell
was
rich
and
deep
full
of
roasted
malts
and
nutty
tones
the
smell
reminded
me
of
some
british
brown
ales
the
taste
was
well
balanced
sweet
roasted
malts
with
the
taste
of
nuts
but
also
a
rich
hoppy
aftertaste
the
carbonation
tingled
the
tongue
a
bit
and
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumtolight
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
slowly
sip
on
for
hours
d
tasty
but
too
sweet
for
me
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
its
a
decent
beer
to
stick
with
but
only
if
youre
ok
with
the
sweetness
and
you
want
something
with
just
a
mild
kick
personally
i
wouldnt
drink
too
much
of
it
but
i
can
see
why
other
might
easy
drinkability
roasted
malt
is
what
this
one
is
all
about
mixed
feelings
about
it
personally
the
pour
was
good
a
light
brown
with
a
thick
white
head
which
lasted
the
entire
drink
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
absent
even
when
first
opened
dont
get
me
wrong
it
had
a
smell
but
the
first
smell
was
of
a
beer
that
was
left
out
on
the
table
all
night
not
impressed
nonetheless
i
kept
on
as
anyone
with
an
open
mind
and
open
beer
would
do
the
taste
was
pretty
good
a
real
fall
flavour
of
nut
and
maybe
a
hint
of
apple
easy
beer
to
drink
smooth
with
a
pleasant
flavour
i
would
call
this
an
average
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
although
i
am
writing
to
you
about
it
hmm
though
not
a
really
great
fall
beer
long
trail
harvest
proved
to
be
a
decent
brew
if
only
for
being
an
interesting
take
on
the
amberred
style
though
much
like
the
label
states
they
didnt
really
seem
to
know
what
they
were
doing
so
how
should
we
be
expected
to
either
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
local
seasonals
its
very
well
balanced
between
a
caramel
malty
brown
brew
and
a
lighter
beer
i
think
it
even
says
something
like
that
on
the
bottle
very
drinkable
subtle
sweetness
but
overall
kind
of
a
refreshing
brown
beer
definitly
better
than
some
other
fall
offerings
but
nothing
id
kill
my
mother
for
very
drinkable
and
somewhat
thin
lifeless
mouthfeel
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
although
it
seems
as
if
other
reviews
have
found
this
to
be
better
than
i
maybe
things
have
changed
with
the
recipe
poured
a
brilliant
clear
light
bronze
color
with
some
deep
burnt
orange
hue
a
frothytight
12
finger
well
retained
head
atopsomewhat
muted
aromas
some
caramel
and
butter
with
an
underlying
light
roastiness
not
much
hop
presence
to
it
flavors
tend
to
be
on
the
malty
side
the
hops
provide
some
earthiness
mainly
starts
out
somewhat
sweet
and
buttery
like
caramel
corn
almost
with
a
defient
toatiness
underneath
the
earthiness
finishes
this
beer
out
in
a
drying
finish
not
a
bad
brew
seems
to
be
pretty
basic
in
the
amber
category
i
personally
would
have
liked
a
more
hop
presence
in
a
harvest
ale
but
this
is
a
quaffing
ale
thanks
to
sam
and
jeff
from
red
white
and
brew
in
florence
for
reccomending
this
beer
it
is
yet
another
enjoyable
that
they
have
steered
me
toward
another
good
beer
from
long
trail
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
onefinger
head
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
upfront
with
some
smokiness
sounds
too
familiar
taste
is
very
strong
at
first
with
almost
little
or
no
malt
flavor
at
first
after
allowing
the
beer
to
warm
up
for
a
few
minutes
the
taste
becomes
somewhat
more
complex
and
smoky
i
would
say
its
drinkable
and
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
feast
or
a
fall
barbeque
on
a
warm
day
which
by
the
way
are
rare
in
vt
during
the
autumn
brew
pours
to
a
nice
brown
highlighted
color
with
a
smallish
head
that
left
only
a
slight
amount
of
lace
has
the
look
of
fresh
brewed
ice
tea
the
aromas
seem
to
be
very
inviting
nice
heavy
toasted
malt
scent
mixed
with
a
slight
bread
dough
scent
mixed
with
cocoa
the
flavors
are
nice
malt
is
very
noticeable
which
seem
to
give
off
a
slight
fruit
like
flavor
which
seems
to
break
quickly
to
a
nutty
like
taste
the
feel
is
very
smooth
as
well
as
possessing
a
slight
dry
like
finish
over
all
i
feel
that
this
is
a
very
good
offering
a
highly
drinkable
brew
rosey
copper
color
with
very
little
head
but
some
ok
lacing
the
aroma
brings
fairly
distinct
malt
with
some
yeast
and
carmel
pretty
sweet
smelling
the
first
taste
hits
me
with
a
more
sour
combination
of
wheat
and
brown
sugar
a
bit
fizzy
and
a
little
watery
with
a
few
more
mouthfulls
it
tames
down
to
more
of
an
even
bread
citrus
blend
still
a
bit
sour
though
easy
drinking
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
not
my
favorite
taste
for
an
ale
a
sturdy
offering
pair
this
one
with
a
hamburger
a
definite
selection
if
you
want
more
then
one
an
above
average
beer
in
a
very
crowded
style
try
it
but
dont
expect
the
best
ever

full

as
i
mentioned
a
great

smooth
and
satisfying
beer
long
trail
perpetuates
their
great
reputation
for
me
with
this
offering
overall
a
blah
amber
not
worth
the
10
price
for
a
6er
doesnt
do
it
for
me
this
offering
from
long
trail
pours
a
deep
red
clear
with
a
thin
head
offwhite
the
nose
is
caramel
nutty
faint
hop
presence
that
continues
sweet
with

and

background
the
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
with

strong
hop

rind
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
then
moves
to
a
malty
sweet
caramel
maple
syrup
balancing
act
that
finishes
somewhat
tart

nature
this
is
a
quality
session
brew
one
that
you
can
drink
all
day
par
for
the
course
for
a
long
trail
offering
slightly
above
average
dry
and
a
little
too
buttery
for
my
liking
i
had
this
on
tap
in
upstate
vt
while
onsite
for
work
much
better
than
out
of
the
bottle
im
not
sure
if
they
have
a
problem
with
their
bottling
machine
or
if
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
but
after
enjoying
this
beer
very
much
i
bought
a
case
to
bring
home
and
it
turned
out
disappointing
at
best
average
amber
the
taste
from
the
tap
is
delicious
i
wouldnt
say
id
buy
it
again
but
if
it
were
on
tap
next
to
say
a
sam
adams
seasonal
this
would
certainly
be
my
first
choice
a
good
crossover
beer
a
classic
red
ale
simple
and
yummy
i
can
picture
this
beer
being
amazing
on
cask
a
great
session
beer
the
poor
was
smooth
and
formed
a
nice
white
head
the
foam
faded
to
a
thin
layer
fast
but
still
left
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
pint
the
color
was
rich
copper
and
quite
clear
the
smell
was
nice
and
malty
with
few
noticeable
hop
tones
true
for
the
style
and
the
apparent
style
this
beer
is
meant
to
mimic
the
taste
was
malty
and
somewhat
complex
with
a
good
selection
of
malt
varieties
including
biscuit
and
possibly
some
vienna
malt
the
hop
balance
was
right
on
not
enough
to
make
the
beer
bitter
but
enough
to
make
this
brew
not
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
somewhat
creamy
but
not
rich
or
heavy
very
drinkable
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
here
smells
very
malty
with
almost
a
smoked
or
peated
aroma
smells
quite
good
taste
is
mellow
with
a
smooth
feel
malts
hit
the
palate
and
please
the
tastebuds
the
malts
add
a
nice
characterstic
to
this
beer
and
really
make
this
beer
flowery
hops
are
present
and
add
to
this
tasty
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
try
to
get
it
again
the
aftertaste
is
very
malty
and
pleasing
delicious
this
is
a
balanced
and
tasty
brew
i
love
all
the
long
trail
products
that
i
have
tried
including
thier
flavored
wheat
scary
but
true
pours
a
dark
transparent
amber
with
a
short
lived
offwhite
head
that
was
rather
shortlived
a
profile
that
is
balanced
toward
the
malty
side
with
a
nice
floral
nose
and
biscuits
and
and
sweet
malt
up
front
some
bittering
afterwards
another
fine
product
that
is
mellow
enough
to
enjoy
as
an
every
day
or
a
session
beer
pours
a
reddish
copper
with
a
two
finger
white
head
there
isnt
a
lot
to
say
about
the
aroma
its
malty
with
an
underlying
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
similar
it
starts
off
malty
and
a
prodigious
volume
of
carbonation
brings
on
the
underlying
seetness
this
is
a
decent
beer
in
the
sense
that
it
is
very
clean
and
smooth
but
it
certainly
wont
challenge
your
palate
it
seems
like
it
would
make
a
nice
beer
for
autumn
tailgating
or
for
around
a
campfire
something
with
a
little
substance
but
still
easy
to
quaff
it
just
isnt
something
to
sit
and
savour
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
mild
brown
ale
ive
got
to
go
get
another
one
now
that
my
glass
is
empty
amberbrown
color
small
head
of
5mm
holds
pretty
well
smell
is
true
to
the
harvest
description
somewhat
malty
and
rustic
the
taste
is
caramellish
malt
with
some
slight
sourness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
average
i
guess
everyone
has
to
make
an
amber
ale
they
are
not
my
favorite
style
and
this
is
far
from
the
best
of
them
that
i
have
tried
still
worth
trying
poured
a
dense
cream
colored

i

there
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a

raspberries
in
the

body
is
solid
which
is
impressive
for
the
amount
of
malt
you
can
taste
in
this
beer
tastes
like
an
amber
and
a
dunkelweizzen
got
buisy
overall
a
great
ale
that
i
highly
recommend
would
be
a
perfect
everyday
ale
that
doesnt
overwhelm
you
at
all
but
is
full
of
flavor
and
character
buy
it
it
isnt
a
typical
american
amber
it
leans
more
towards
a
blend
of
amber
and
a
brown
and
does
it
very
very
well
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
tommorow
good
fall
beer
it
tastes
like
the
season
this
is
a
great
fall
amber
the
slick
caramel
malt
presence
compliments
the
style
very
well
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
complex
it
seems
to
get
very
tasty
recommended
tapped
at
pool
factory
in
manchester
ct
for
the
fall
make
sure
you
ask
them
to
not
give
you
the
iced
and
dripping
glasses
which
seem
to
be
their
only
consistent
feature
reasonable
amber
tone
with
an
offwhite
head
that
held
and
smeared
heavy
malting
on
the
nose
with
something
that
reminds
me
of
old
wet
cedar
the
malts
hit
solidly
on
the
tongue
fading
and
giving
way
to
hoppiness
at
the
back
of
your
tongue
there
was
a
certain
aftertaste
that
was
slightly
heavy
like
it
was
heated
or
something
that
didnt
bode
well
good
carbonation
and
somewhat
chewable
well
overwall
drinkable
but
i
suspect
itd
be
better
if
the
factory
itself
was
better
d
aside
from
the
overeffervescent
mouthfeel
the
gentle
and
balanced
tastes
in
this
beer
make
it
easy
to
drink
up
a
decent
but
decidedly
pedestrian
offer
from
long
trail
mouthfeeldrinkability
smooth
and
just
slightly
prickly
in
the
mouth
this
one
goes
down
too
easily
the
texture
is
so
nice
and
easy
certainly
not
watery
but
not
too
beefy
either
after
finishing
this
bottle
on
nearly
an
empty
stomach
there
is
absolutely
no
trace
of
the
alcohols
effects
guaranteeing
that
this
will
be
a
session
brew
this

another
win
for
long

cheers
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
light
coating
of
head
that
falls
to
barely
coat
the
brew
the
nose
is
moderately
buttery
with
a
caramel
base
behind
it
the
flavor
is
also
slightly
buttery
without
a
whole
lot
more
going
for
it
the
body
is
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
an
easy
drinking
brew
but
im
not
overly
keen
on
the
flavors
or
aroma
it
might
work
better
as
a
scottish
i
expect
at
least
some
hop
in
a
harvest
ale
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
caramel
malts
and
some
american
hops
with
some
butterscotch
the
flavor
has
a
lot
to
be
desired
its
slightly
drying
and
the
flavor
just
isnt
very
interesting
there
is
some
caramel
malt
and
some
hop
character
but
it
just
doesnt
meld
well
and
it
doesnt
have
what
i
want
to
taste
the
body
is
sligthly
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
medium
bodied
and
smooth

nice

to

it

a
flavor
that
reminds

of
a
cool
morning
in

the
aftertaste
is
excellent
with
a
buttery

that
is
beautifully
counterbalanced
with
a
sharp

balance
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
great
fall
session
beer
from
a
vt
brewery
i
look
forward
to
most
of
this

every

and
this
one
is
no
exception
poured

character
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
little
less
depth
of
malt
character
than
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
great
a
nice
seasonal
from
the
guys
at
long
trail
worth
getting
if
you
see
it
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
very
sweet
and
fruity
smelling
malt
aroma
that
refreshes
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
yet
slightly
dry
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
harvest
brew
it
has
good
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
drinker
freshly
imported
from
vermont
this
ale
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
with
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
nothing
spectacular
but
the
intial
sip
left
a
nice
smokey
taste
the
flavor
is
very
subtle
and
not
overpowering
in
anyway
this
ale
is
quite
smooth
and
very
drinkable
pours
out
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
shade
of
gold
in
there
light
carbonation
can
be
seen
with
turns
into
lacing
afterwards
smell
was
nice
toasted
malts
caramel
nutty
aromas
and
some
light
hops
are
in
the
background
to
balance
it
out
taste
was
good
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
nose
but
with
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
comes
up
in
the
end
some
nice
toffee
and
toasted
flavors
show
up
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
got
a
little
ding
because
it
was
a
little
bit
watery
in
the
aftertaste
but
other
than
that
a
top
3
fall
seasonal
for
me
just
goes
down
too
fast
using
all
of
the
malt
and
hops
from
their
other
beers
is
kind
of
a
gimmick
but
they
pull
it
off
i
must
say
i
was
shocked
by
this
beer
didnt
expect
much
poured
brownish
auburn
with
a
big
thick
lasting
head
i
loved
the
smell
had
hints
of
honey
the
mouthfeel
was
wonderfully
fluid
and
mouth
coating
the
blend
of
flavors
is
quite
impressive
honey
woodsy
roasty
very
drinkable
and
quenching
brew
highly
recommended
thanks
to
rabidawg
for
it
not
a
super
flavorfull
beer
taste
profile
is
subtle
but
nice
well
done
amber
there
are
better
ambers
around
but
this
is
solid
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
again
though

nice
offering
from
long
trail
dark
amber
in
color
with
decent
head
receding
slowly
coming
right
at
me
are
the
spices
and
the
hops
i
want
to
open
the
window
to
let
the
october
new
england
night
air
in
here
i
will
drink
this
again
as
it
is
available
all
around
here
the
beer
cascades
from
the
bottle
in
the
form
of
a
limpid
dark
copper
color
the
head
is
modest
in
size
bubbly
in
texture
and
a
light
tan
color
the
lace
is
a
covering
sheet
nice
malt
nose
caramel
and
fresh
sweet
start
with
a
rather
thin
top
finish
is
crisply
acidic
hops
are
resplendent
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
aftertaste
and
a
decent
drinking
beer
very
similar
to
the
bottled
version
with
a
touch
less
diacetyl
through
the
flavor
the
butterscotch
isnt
so
overwhelming
pleasant
toasty
caramel
maltiness
with
mild
herbal
hopping
in
the
finish
the
beer
still
retains
that
signature
long
trail
coarseness
and
grainy
finish
but
its
a
bit
better
on
tap
taste
is
bitter
hops
up
front
followed
by
big
rich
malt
and
followed
again
by
a
big
hoppy
bitterness
lots
going
on
here
nutty
and
thick
feeling
like
syrup
sticky
a
bit
unbalanced
with
the
hops
overpowering
the
malt
at
the
end
but
otherwise
is
nicely
conceived
very
nice
fall
brew
for
chilly
new
england
falls
pours
out
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
light
head
the
varity
of
malts
and
hops
in
this
brew
is
vast
and
it
shows
in
flavor
for
it
tastes
bold
and
beautiful
very
well
balanced
but
not
as
smooth
as
i
would
have
liked
certainly
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
worthy
substitute
if
the
store
is
sold
out
of
jinx
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
disappearing
head
the
smell
is
interesting
with
a
touch
of
maple
and
fresh
bread
interesting
a
chewy
caramel
flavor
runs
throughout
the
profile
with
flashing
hints
of
dark
malts
crystal
and
either
special
b
or
a
touch
of
chocolate
slight
hops
but
only
in
flavor
not
in
bitterness
or
aroma
nicely
balanced
the
finish
is
sweet
an
interesting
beer
that
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
commercial
version
of
a
kitchen
sink
beer
that
home
brewers
do
with
leftover
grains
and
much
better
there
is
a
flavor
i
cant
identify
still
that
adds
a
bit
of
mystery
to
the
brew
causing
me
to
have
another
dark
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
frothy
head
that
sinks
quickly
low
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
flowers
a
little
buttery
flavor
is
light
and
sweet
mild
malt
also
a
bit
flowery
with
some
notes
of
popcorn
low
hop
presence
smooth
mouthfeel
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
low
side
flavor
is
a
bit
too
mild
for
me
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
very
flat
across
the
malt
profile
thinish
mouthfeel
and
very
little
hop
character
that
was
enjoyable
im
really
suprised
how
much
i
didnt
like
this
beer
after
reading
previous
reviews
thought
it
would
be
my
kind
of
brown
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
with
low
retention
the
nose
was
awesome
a
mix
of
caramel
notes
and
piney
hops
the
flavor
was
very
bitter
balanced
by
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
and
finishing
with
an
astingent
sourness
it
was
very
smooth
drinking
and
plenty
refreshing
so
far
one
of
my
favorite
fall
seasonals
though
i
wonder
how
this
is
categorized
as
a
pa
pours
a
clear
auburn
amber
with
a
small
tan
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
good
lacing
aroma
is
all
over
the
place
with
the
maltiness
bready
caramel
and
lots
of
nuttiness
flavor
again
is
dominated
with
maltiness
nuttiness
up
front
some
caramel
and
bread
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
show
up
in
there
hops
flavor
and
aroma
are
at
a
minimum
here
but
the
flavor
is
still
pretty
large
and
diverse
body
is
mediumfull
and
it
goes
down
dangerously
easy
poured
a
beautiful
chocolate
creamy
head
smell
was
nice
and
malty
taste
had
a
hint
of
tartness
embedded
in
a
nice
malt
base
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
but
had
enough
kick
at
the
end
to
let
you
know
it
wasnt
that
light
a
nice
sit
down
beer
well
worth
sipping
through
and
leaves
you
with
a
nice
aftertaste
notes
i
truly
wish
this
werent
so
carbonated
but
its
still
the
beast
fall
seasonal
ive
had
certainly
my
favorite
of
long
trails
offerings
you
wont
be
disappointed
with
this
one
although
the
greenness
might
stand
for
some
mellowing
this
is
a
terrifically
tasty
brew
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
reddish
color
with
a
thin
clingy
head
the
head
falls
quickly
but
the
wisps
that
remain
leave
decent
lace
the
smell
is
fantastic
toasted
malts
and
a
background
of
floral
hops
medium
body
great
malt
character
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
its
one
of
those
beers
that
i
can
keep
sniffing
and
sipping
all
night
i
love
this
beer
it
was
at
the
latest
sampling
session
and
it
was
just
marvelous
smooth
creamy
malts
just
melt
into
you
as
you
throw
it
back
not
that
alcoholic
malty
taste
but
a
nice
clean
sweet
maltiness
that
just
makes
you
tingle
smooooooooooooooooooooth
creamy
amber
beer
that
goes
down
like
butta
lots
of
malt
flavor
and
comes
out
with
some
serious
sweetness
but
not
sugarysweet
definitely
a
winner
with
me
did
i
mention
the
maltiness
aroma
is
malty
almost
like
toasted
whole
wheat
bread
with
hints
of
hop
sweetness
a
nicely
complex
brew
flavors
of
cocoa
toast
nuts
some
fruitiness
and
a
decent
amount
of
hop
bitterness
combine
to
keep
your
entire
mouth
interested
a
beer
thats
perfectly
suited
to
its
release
you
can
practically
taste
smell
fallen
leaves
on
a
vermont
lane
stupidly
poetic
yes
but
thats
the
image
the
flavor
of
this
one
conjures
up
a
fall
favorite
and
one
of
long
trails
better
efforts
gotta
give
props
to
pbrian
for
sending
this
one
my
way
while
probably
inspired
by
an
octoberfest
that
is
just
a
starting
point
this
brew
forges
its
own
path
probably
my
favorite
long
trail
a
clear
russet
body
is
topped
by
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
drops
fairly
quickly
but
holds
an
exceptional
collar
and
light
surface
coating
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
as
well
the
aroma
is
gently
fruity
lightly
chocolatey
and
somewhat
nutty
the
body
is
light
with
a
very
fine
gentle
carbonation
that
leaves
it
quite
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
starts
with
some
fruitiness
summer
berries
very
light
cherry
mellows
into
a
toasty
nutty
maltiness
and
then
turns
lightly
cocoaish
character
it
finishes
with
a
softly
fluttering
bitterness
and
lingering
biscuity
nutty
character
light
and
far
from
rich
but
full
of
character
that
keeps
it
interesting
exceptionally
drinkable
pours
a
great
bright
amber
color
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
that
sinks
but
never
disappears
and
laces
the
glass
very
nicely
very
nice
toasty
malt
aroma
with
a
nice
citric
hoppiness
of
grapefruits
and
some
other
hoppy
fruitiness
nice
toasty
maltiness
that
carries
all
the
way
through
the
beer
and
holds
it
up
nicely
the
chewy
resinny
hops
come
through
about
half
way
through
and
have
a
nice
pineycitrus
character
that
is
almost
chewy
the
smoothness
of
the
malt
balances
nicely
with
a
crisp
quality
that
the
hops
provide
and
make
this
one
excellently
drinkable
brew
yet
another
big
winner
from
long
trail
excellent
beer
a
big
thanks
to
pbrian
for
the
brew
ahh
my
first
fall
beer
of
the
season
life
is
good
looks
beautiful
in
the
glass
clear
reddish
amber
with
thick
sticky
head
toasty
nutty
aromas
with
small
amounts
of
flowery
hops
malt
profile
is
deep
and
complex
toasted
and
biscuity
with
some
nuttiness
drier
overall
but
a
little
sweetness
coats
the
mouth
nice
beer
by
far
my
favorite
in
the
long
trail
family
let
this
one
sit
for
a
while
after
taking
it
out
of
the
fridge
or
else
youre
depriving
yourself
of
the
true
greatness
of
this
beer
flavorsaromas
galore
a
great
seasonal
and
a
great
ale
overall
notes
a
fall
seasonal
sure
to
please
the
hard
core
ale
drinkers
serve
at
cellar
temp
and
it
is
to
die
for
a
smorgasbord
for
the
senses
to
make
for
a
truly
great
brew
i
wasnt
particularly
fond
of
the
way
that
long
trail
used
american
hops
in
their
hibernator
scottishstyle
ale
because
they
just
dont
quite
fit
i
didnt
find
that
they
worked
within
the
overall
balance
of
the
beer
inappropriate
hops
however
are
not
the
case
here
theyve
used
northern
brewer
and
they
work
out
just
fine
regardless
of
where
they
were
actually
grown
im
assuming
pacific
northwest
northern
brewer
hops
are
in
fact
fairly
traditional
for
an
englishstyle
brown
ale
in
this
case
they
add
a
bit
of
leafiness
mintiness
and
subtle
grassiness
at
a
level
thats
just
strong
enough
to
stand
out
from
the
nutty
chocolatey
and
lightly
caramelish
maltiness
one
valid
question
might
then
be
have
they
used
too
much
hop
flavor
as
the
style
really
calls
for
the
malt
to
dominate
followed
by
the
yeast
character
as
the
second
feature
its

was
a

brown
beer
with
a
medium
head
that
lasted
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
it
had
a
roasted
malt
and
slightly
grainy
aroma
the
taste
was
sweet

very
light

tastewise
but
the
bitterness
makes
it
harder
to
throw
down

i
think
its
a
little
too
bitter
but
dissipated
quickly
as
well
leaving

little
bits

of
nuts
much
to

this
