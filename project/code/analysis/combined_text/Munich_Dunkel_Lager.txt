overall
very
much
a
sly
fox
beer
clean
good
true
to
style
and
slightly
complex
the
flavors
shine
in
this
one
could
easily
do
a
six
although
i
still
prefer
other
beers
from
this
brewery
o
this
one
definitely
grows
on
you
a
worth
example
of
the
style
overall
pretty
easy
but
a
little
unexpected
but
still
pretty
fun
to
drink
interesting
this
slyfox
brewery
is
with
their
german
styles
pours
a
mostly
clear
medium
brown
moderate
cap
of
slightly
off
white
froth
little
retention
on
lacing
scent
leads
with
plenty
of
sweetness
but
lacking
in
malt
character
light
caramel
faint
faint
vegital
note
taste
again
is
sweet
but
not
in
a
pleasant
malty
way
mostly
residual
sugarlike
light
caramel
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
some
creaminess
but
no
crispness
uninspiring
lacking
character
overall
a
very
solid
crisp
dunkel
lager
with
a
surprising
smoothness
the
more
i
have
the
more
i
think
this
is
rivaling
the
pikeland
pils
for
drinkability
a
good
solid
drinker
but
just
a
bit
understated
highly
sessionable
though
m
d
very
drinkable
with
perfect
co2tosweetness
balance
oh
yea
nicely
done
sly
fox
creamy
and
has
a
nice
sweet
roast
interplay
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
i
really
enjoyed
the
ofest
from
them
and
this
one
follows
in
the
same
vein
they
certainly
know
their
lagers
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
i
could
use
a
bit
less
roasty
astringency
on
the
finish

o
the
munich
comes
through
in
this
beer
and
makes
it
a
nice
session
beer
im
very
amazed
at
the
quality
of
this
lager
everytime
i
drink
one
of
these
gems
i
keep
wondering
why
i
spend
so
much
of
time
on
ipas
and
heavy
stouts
etc
if
this
beer
is
available
where
you
live
dont
overlook
it
poured
a
clear
copper
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
receded
to
a
patchy
layer
mainly
caramel
in
the
aroma
with
some
musk
going
on
slightly
toasted
malts
in
the
taste
caramel
nuts
slightly
earthy
with
a
little
hoppiness
coming
in
afterward
medium
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
o
a
solid
if
not
overly
remarkable
lager
that
showcases
positively
the
germanicbavarian
heritage
of
the
style
likable
enough
and
quite
easy
to
drink
nice
to
be
able
to
try
a
good
maltforward
lager
like
this
especially
from
a
can
no
armtwisting
required
for
me
to
have
another
if
only
i
had
another
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
as
a
single
but
it
still
hasnt
made
me
want
more
6
pack
or
case
if
i
really
want
a
tasty
dunkel
i
would
just
pick
up
a
spaten
pours
an
amber
brown
with
a
good
amount
of
head
looks
fairly
pretty
smells
very
malty
and
dunkly
sme
nice
lagery
yeastiness
on
the
nose
as
well
tastes
sweet
and
malt
heavy
a
hint
of
yeastiness
and
some
nice
light
roast
thick
solid
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
very
sessionable
pours
an
interesting
medium
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
white
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
caramel
and
sweet
malts
and
some
toasted
bread
tastes
of
sweet
malts
and
a
little
caramel
and
a
mild
flavor
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
mild
carbonation
drinkability
is
medium
and
nice
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
singlefinger
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
and
does
not
leave
behind
much
other
than
a
few
spots
of
lacing
the
nose
is
comprised
mostly
of
sweet
malt
along
with
a
bit
of
caramel
some
hops
in
the
background
something
quite
odd
about
it
this
continues
into
the
taste
which
is
a
bit
too
sweet
without
much
of
anything
other
than
mild
hops
to
carry
it
through
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
butter
starts
to
come
through
as
it
warms
probably
not
something
id
drink
again
but
who
doesnt
love
a
good
canned
beer
beer
is
thin
and
watery
with
a
sweetness
that
goes
with
the
aroma
its
not
good
i
do
not
enjoy
this
beer
the
taste
is
slightly
better
than
the
aroma
which
tempted
me
to
just
pour
it
out
but
my
curiosity
always
wins
out
sly
fox
is
not
winning
me
over
with
this
thin
overly
sweet
disaster
of
the
a
lager
also
there
is
a
strong
diacetyl
character
i
wont
have
this
again
d
perhaps
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side
for
the
style
but
it
suits
my
taste
well
id
definitely
get
this
again
this
is
actually
good
so
nice
id
do
it
twice
and
probably
will
just
to
doublecheck
some
points
and
i
feel
arguably
representative
of
the
style
just
approaching
having
some
characteristic
depth
alas
sly
fox
cant
brew
all
the
german
styles
perfectly
the
pils
and
weizen
were
spot
on
but
this
dunkel
falls
a
bit
flat
decent
beer
here
and
whats
wrong
with
that
id
like
to
know
besides
the
nose
this
was
pretty
decent
but
ive
had
this
on
draft
at
the
brewpubs
and
enjoyed
it
much
more
then
maybe
this
can
was
a
little
beyond
its
sell
by
date
drinkability
not
bad
a
good
beer
that
is
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
interested
but
not
overwhelming
the
abv
is
moderate
and
that
helps
as
well
i
do
wish
the
flavors
were
a
little
more
fulfilling
and
robust
though
d
a
great
bmc
gateway
brew
another
can
past
its
labeled
prime
but
tasting
very
fresh
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
surprising
for
a
dunkel
lager
how
nice
it
is
this
may
have
restored
my
faith
in
lagers
one
of
the
first
beer
ive
had
of
this
style
going
to
have
to
check
out
a
few
more
md
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
reasonable
quite
drinkable
for
a
dunkel
good
example
of
the
style
crackery
pilsner
malts
lead
the
way
while
hints
of
toasted
caramel
balance
nicely
with
a
spiciness
from
german
hops
a
slightly
offputting
metallic
sourness
on
the
finish
suggests
copper
sulfur
and
nickel
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
creamy
for
a
lager
and
the
minerals
dont
do
much
to
help
the
highly
carbonated
finish
all
in
all
a
decent
attempt
but
id
probably
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
since
this
is
the
first
sly
fox
brew
ive
been
able
to
try
i
wont
be
giving
up
on
them
as
something
tells
me
they
can
do
better
overall
a
solid
beer
but
not
a
head
turner
in
my
opinion
still
i
would
drink
it
anytime
as
i
did
enjoy
it
d
although
the
taste
wasnt
there
the
refreshing
and
drinkability
factor
was
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
pours
a
clear
med
copperbrown
color
w
a
thick
off
white
cap
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
decent
lacing
in
my
pilsn
glass
not
a
strong
smell
at
all
some
steely
grain
w
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
diacetyl
a
nice
balance
of
hop
bitterness
to
malts
flavor
is
mostly
cereal
grains
and
nuts
with
a
tart
faint
diacetyl
note
more

a
dry

pretty
good
sly
fox
dunkel
lager
is
a
very
clear
amber
beer
with
no
visible
carbonation
the
head
is
a
dense
white
foam
that
leaves
nice
lacing
and
has
great
retention
it
has
a
very
faint
aroma
like
pretzels
or
dough
it
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
sharp
finish
it
has
a
simple
flavor
with
good
bitterness
it
is
crisp
and
dry
and
makes
for
easy
drinking
pours
a
clear
chesnut
hue
with
a
very
light
tan
colored
head
that
falls
to
thin
layer
of
foam
really
not
much
lacing
to
be
seen
but
there
are
a
few
spots
here
and
there
smell
is
light
and
sweet
with
carmelized
almonds
and
and
bread
very
faint
noble
hops
with
honey
and
grass
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
begins
with
a
touch
of
lemon

solid
nutty
backbone
midway
the
sweetl
malts
emerge
with
notes
of
caramel
and
cocoa
powder
aftertaste
is
bready
with
some
roasted
malts
pretty
good
light
and
creamy
body
with
a
steady
carbonation
a
nice
mouthfeel
which
almost
feels
like
a
session
beer
some
of
this
and
pikeland
plis
would
be
perfect
for
18
holes
a
style
im
not
too
familiar
with
but
i
would
love
to
revisit
this
one
for
sure
the
taste
is
fruity
sweet
and
complex
this
is
the
first
i
have
had
from
thsi
style
so
im
not
quite
sure
what
im
tasting
besides
that
is
has
a
slight
macro
euro
lager
flavor
to
it
smooth
medium
feel
there
is
just
something
missing
not
sure
what
but
it
needed
the
missing
piece
worth
a
try
but
nowhere
near
the
glorious
goop
that
comes
out
of
the
pikeland
pils
can
this
is
fairly
light
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
and
makes
for
a
fairly
dirnkable
brew
still
its
an
average
dunkel
at
best
for
me
overall
this
was
a
bit
disappointing
for
me
it
just
really
came
off
very
flat
light
and
one
sided
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
from
them
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
batch
hard
to
tell
but
a
winner
this
was
not
drinkability
im
going
to
be
pouring
this
out
and
rinsing
my
mouth
out
i
wouldve
rated
it
worse
if
i
didnt
know
that
there
werent
some
things
here
that
were
good
and
trying
to
get
passed
whatever
happened
to
this
beer
there
is
obviously
something
wrong
with
this
particular
can
and
i
plan
to
rereview
it
mouthfeel
is
a
solid
medium
and
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
overall
this
dunkel
tastes
too
clean
and
sterile
for
me
to
recommend
this
to
someone
else
a
little
lifeless
and
what
is
there
isnt
particularly
favorable
maybe
its
the
can
that
has
put
me
off
but
ive
enjoyed
other
canned
sly
fox
brews
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
plus
foamy
offwhite
head
some
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
not
really
that
much
of
a
brew
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
recommeneded
when
poured
into
a
victory
pint
glass
the
sly
fox
is
a
almost
clear
chestnut
amber
color
that
had
a
12
inch
head
of
white
foam
it
didnt
take
the
head
of
foam
very
long
to
dissipate
into
a
few
islands
of
white
bubbles
white
bubbly
rings
along
the
edge
and
spots
of
white
lace
the
aroma
was
mostly
filled
with
sweet
juicy
fruits
and
a
slight
pinch
of
caramel
here
and
there
that
was
it
when
it
warmed
up
quite
a
bit
the
aroma
stayed
the
same
it
didnt
want
to
change
the
taste
started
off
minor
with
sweet
roasted
malts
and
a
small
dab
of
sweet
caramel
after
the
sweetness
had
left
the
tongue
in
comes
the
crispy
citrus
hops
with
a
smidge
of
grapefruit
behind
it
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
lightly
sweet
and
crispy
aftertaste
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
a
handfull
of
citrus
hops
the
most
interesting
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
a
can
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
much
a
decent
dunkel
lager
it
took
me
a
few
ounces
to
get
into
the
dunkel
lager
swing
of
things
once
i
did
however
the
quality
of
sly
fox
dunkel
lager
was
easy
to
appreciate
cheers
for
their
recent
award
on
this
offeringss
behalf
for
once
it
looks
like
a
beer
judging
competition
got
it
right
d
very
good
drinkability
very
clean
flavor
and
probably
one
of
the
best
by
styles
ive
tasted
a
prime
example
that
beer
in
a
can
can
be
everybit
as
good
as
from
a
bottle
d
pretty
tasty
lager
not
much
to
look
at
but
pretty
solid
flavor
throughout
it
got
two
fingers
worth
of
foamy
deeptan
head
that
quickly
fell
away
to
wisps
the
nose
had
a
chocolatecaramel
scent
to
it
not
lagerlike
at
all
the
color
was
deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
and
there
was
a
rolling
mix
of
maltysweetness
roastychocolate
and
slightly
bitter
hops
on
the
tongue
the
finish
seemed
to
linger
with
a
more
caramelized
sweetness
than
anything
else
another
really
good
beer
from
the
sly
fox
peeps
hey
suze
may
i
have
some
more
puhleeze
good
for
the
style
but
a
little
lacking
in
complexity
theres
distinct
and
tasty
munich
malts
with
dark
licorice
flavors
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
a
great
german
session
beer
i
appreciate
that
i
can
get
this
fresh
from
a
local
brewer
instead
of
having
to
try
a
green
bottle
thats
been
shipped
thousands
of
miles
im
watching
a
commercial
with
an
old
couple
sucking
face
in
the
backseat
of
a
car
but
not
even
that
can
rain
on
this
beers
comfy
parade
hows
that
for
an
endorsement
it
drinks
easily
and
finishes
with
a
clean
slide
its
happily
basic
and
hence
fundamentally
good
its
much
better
than
watching
people
with
dentures
french
kissing
thats
for
sure
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
dunkel
very
tasty
and
an
awesome
lager
drinkability
sourness
makes
this
hard
to
drink
especially
since
its
unexpected
crazy
checkthis
beer
seems
to
have
a
very
consistent
rating
in
the
high
3
range
for
most
people
a
lot
in
the
3
8
so
the
can
seems
to
be
giving
a
solid
similar
impression
to
most
even
a
couple
low
raters
said
better
than
a
macro
but
didnt
push
higher
on
the
score
seems
to
be
nothing
to
really
hate
but
maybe
not
anything
particulary
unique
to
really
fall
in
love
with
one
said
he
couldnt
see
it
as
a
session
beer
though
i
think
it
falls
right
in
that
range
i
had
this
with
a
salad
it
was
complimentary
nice
but
sweet
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
couldnt
imagine
this
being
a
session
beer
d
kind
of
tasty
goes
down
easily
decent
kick
to
it
not
too
filling
good
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
a
little
on
the
bland
side
which
would
make
me
look
for
something
else
if
at
all
possible
the
brew
poured
to
a
nice
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
large
light
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
and
left
a
bunch
of
lacing
through
out
the
aroma
is
sweet
some
chocolate
like
notes
and
a
slight
metallic
iron
smell
which
is
not
bad
the
brew
goes
down
pretty
well
good
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
but
has
a
nice
nutty
flavor
some
cocoa
and
caramel
with
a
slight
hop
break
at
the
tail
end
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
to
me
it
has
a
sweetness
at
least
that
is
what
i
am
perceiving
it
as
that
tends
to
make
this
a
brew
that
i
could
enjoy
only
one
or
two
at
a
single
sitting

thanks
jay
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
to
start
things
out
grain
taste
not
much
else
hard
to
separate
this
from
a
michelob
dark
much
better
than
a
macro
lager
though
cleaner
for
sure
bottom
line
this
has
a
really
unusual
taste
for
a
dunkel
and
that
keeps
me
interested
for
the
entire
session
i
recommend
it
as
it
would
make
for
an
excellent
summertime
staple
overall
not
too
bad
a
sixer
might
get
too
cloying
sweet
to
drink
2
or
3
would
be
the
max
drinkability
while
i
have
had
better
dunkels
penn
dark
coming
to
mind
as
a
comparison
from
the
western
part
of
the
state
this
is
not
bad
part
of
my
bombing
from
skinnyelvis
wish
i
could
get
these
cans
around
here
yummy
a
solid
everyday
all
purpose
cooler
weather
lager
nice
job
for
lager
loving
pa
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
i
really
dig
some
of
the
sly
fox
bombers
a
lot
ive
been
less
than
impressed
with
the
canned
products
thus
far
i
thought
it
was
the
simple
fact
of
canned
beer
at
first
but
ive
had
a
few
winners
packaged
in
cans
in
recent
months
unfortunately
this
one
was
by
far
my
least
favourite
of
the
seven
or
eight
craft
brews
ive
sampled
from
a
can
in
the
end
its
far
from
awful
and
fairly
average
in
most
aspects
but
i
cant
recommend
it
this
is
a
decent
dark
lager
a
bit
too
sweet
with
an
odd
aroma
enough
going
on
to
be
interesting
and
smooth
enough
to
be
drinkable
one
to
grab
when
going
to
a
place
where
cans
are
more
practical
than
bottles
drinkability
its
nice
to
get
a
solid
dark
lager
in
a
can
worth
trying
put
some
in
your
golf
bag
since
bottles
dont
work
there
ive
gotta
say
its
really
awesome
to
see
that
sly
fox
beers
are
now
being
distributed
up
here
in
western
new
york
their
beers
used
to
be
merely
a
treat
i
could
find
when
we
made
our
way
down
to
new
jersey
even
then
i
dont
remember
seeing
the
dunkel
lager
anywhere
down
there
so
poured
into
a
footed
pilsner
glass
i
have
before
me
a
caramelamber
colored
brew
with
an
expressive
and
fluffy
newsprinthued
head
spicy
almost
gamey
noble
hop
aromas
that
remind
me
of
tarragon
and
sage
along
with
some
very
muted
dark
bread
dough
scents
biscuity
malts
appear
in
the
taste
bringing
with
them
some
sweetish
caramel
notes
and
the
aforementioned
hop
spice
flavors
this
would
kill
with
some
good
grilled
kielbasa
i
bet
great
noble
hop
flavorsscents
buzz
the
nostrils
during
the
burps
light
in
body
smooth
and
crisp

lagerclean
as
well
a
damn
solid
beer
i
think
i
may
have
found
a
new
session
lager
in
a
word
kickass
poured
a
light
to
medium
brown
with
a
huge
blooming
head
that
went
over
my
glass
before
i
could
do
anything
about
itnice
aromas
quite
floral
with
wispy
cocoa
notes
and
a
touch
of
iron
and
roastedness
pretty
clean
flavors
touches
of
cocoa
and
biscuity
malt
with
an
underlying
nuttiness
subtle
but
nice
flavors
and
quite
food
friendly
and
i
really
liked
the
nosei
never
had
this
when
i
lived
near
the
brew
pub
iam
glad
to
have
it
on
hand
now
cheers
d
it
is
really
great
to
have
this
style
available
to
me
locally
i
keep
this
on
hand
regularly
even
the
bmc
folks
enjoy
this
one
when
visiting
overall
a
tasty
and
very
quaffable
dunkel
another
good
canned
offering
from
sly
fox
12
ounce
can
thanks
beerbeing
a
recomned
brew
if
you
can
find
it
give
it
out
to
everyone
you
can
definitely
great
to
visit
a
new
beer
establishment
in
the
burgh
and
see
the
newest
offerings
from
small
breweries
on
stock
along
with
400
other
micro
belgian
and
german
beers
this
was
the
case
at
bocktown
beer
and
grille
the
first
german
style
dunkel
ive
ever
imbibed
from
a
can
appears
a
dark
copper
amber
tone
with
a
large
cream
head
leaves
behind
fine
even
lacing
all
around
my
glass
with
each
sip
definitely
a
different
color
than
the
king
of
all
american
brewed
dunkel
lagers
penn
dark
but
i
will
accept
this
one
aromatics
somewhat
funky
character
some
grassy
noble
hops
it
really
smells
unique
for
the
style
also
has
mild
chocolate
and
toasty
caramel
malt
highlights
but
the
tart
mild
lactic
character
has
me
scratching
my
head
it
didnt
turn
me
off
just
really
caught
me
off
guard
for
a
dunkel
flavors
combine
well
and
that
slight
tart
funky
malt
acidity
actually
works
with
a
balancing
hearty
bready
sweet
malt
tone
doused
with
a
finishing
blast
of
noble
herbal
hop
character
with
a
delicate
grassy
character
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
evenly
carbonated
really
is
quaffable
and
smooth
textured
drinkability
much
like
their
other
canned
offerings
not
the
most
intriguing
and
well
made
versions
but
damn
drinkable
along
with
enough
original
tones
to
make
it
a
go
to
when
grabbing
canned
micros
with
the
limited
niche
market
these
should
sell
without
a
problem
very
drinkable
pretty
nice
dunkle
putting
this
in
the
can
didnt
hurt
at
all
enjoy
a
pleasing
toasted
malt
aroma
great
taste
with
this
one
awesome
beer
from
a
amazing
brewer
remove
the
phenolic
accent
and
this
could
be
a
dunkel
worth
talking
about
it
was
a
very
good
average
beer
dark
and
delicious
but
surprisingly
light
this
beer
is
an
experience
that
you
wont
forget
this
bavarian
dunkelstyle
lager
has
a
beautiful
nutty
and
toasty
malt
body
despite
its
darkness
it
drinks
lightly
this
beer
is
perfectly
carbonated
to
scrub
the
palate
without
being
burdonsome
has
good
head
retention
and
a
smooth
finish
delicious

overallthis
is
a
great

and
it
doesnt

half
bad
to
boot
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
give
to
someone
who
doesnt
drink

the
flavors
could
be
stronger
but
for
a
lager
they
are
better
than
most
3

overall
a
nice
dark
lager
i
prefer
a
bit
more
chewiness
in
the
feel
and
a
spicy
instead
of
a
citruslike
note
on
the
finish
but
this
is
a
nice
traditional
lager
if
you
must
have
lots
of
hops
look
elsewhere
got
as

the

it
is
a
good
representation

the
style
great
session
beer
taste
offers
a
surprisingly
nice
kick
right
from
the
outset
with
that
sweet
breadiness
omnipresent
in
the
aroma
that
works
every
part
of
the
tongue
from
start
to
finish
the
only
sort
of
hop
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
middle
with
a
very
earthy
slightly
grassy
taste
though
its
frankly
too
mild
to
be
of
any
considerable
note
body
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
very
smooth
given
my
inexperience
with
the
style
i
cant
say
much
other
than
that
its
very
tasty
though
everything
seems
simply
par
for
the
course
definitely
worth
trying
tasty
and
balanced
and
with
just
5
abv
you
can
enjoy
barabarossa
all
day
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
makes
a
good
accompaniment
to
food
but
seems
like
it
could
use
a
little
more
complexities
in
the
flavors
to
make
it
a
beer
to
drink
on
its
own
o
overall
decent
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
or
lager
styles
in
general
but
this
one
wasnt
bad
i
wont
drink
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
d
i
like
this
one
could
session
o
nice
evening
beer
good
for
the
upcoming
winter
months
nice
flavors
but
some
bitterness
would
add
some
needed
depth
to
the
beer
the
aroma
needs
to
lose
the
metallic
scent
as
well
overall
though
i
wouldnt
deny
one
offered
o
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
as
most
dunkel
brewers
outside
munich
seem
to
do
the
use
of
roasted
malts
takes
away
from
a
sweet
toasty
breadiness
that
should
be
more
prominent
if
this
had
been
labeled
a
schwarzbier
id
probably
rated
it
all
5s
stick
to
sam
adams
black
lager
for
the
same
money
at
least
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
or
sprecher
black
bavarian
which
has
all
the
viscocity
and
appearance
qualities
that
this
does
not
not
much
head
formed
even
with
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
nicelooking
beer
the
color
of
dark
cherry
wood
smells
strongly
of
sweet
caramel
with
some
fresh
crispness
also
noticeable
also
tastes
primarily
of
caramel
theres
an
undertone
of
crisp
apple
as
well
overall
clean
well
made
beer
that
said
it
is
not
that
interesting
and
alcohol
seems
too
high
this
could
be
a
style
issue
with
me
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
maybe
with
some
age
this
beer
would
improve
im
glad
i
finally
tried
this
one
after
seeing
it
so
often
its
a
good
beer
and
i
could
drink
it
any
time
of
the
year
one
of
my
favorites
out
of
the
moerlein
selection
drinkability
average
nothing
more
or
less
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
a
decent
dark
lager
flavorful
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
either
drinkability
this
beer
was
just
ok
in
my
opinion
i
could
probably
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
but
i
just
dont
think
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
after
1
or
2
i
would
probably
want
to
move
on
to
something
else
this
beer
was
watered
down
enough
that
you
could
enjoy
it
easily
all
night
high
marks
for
this
one
if
someone
desires
a
session
beer
you
really
couldnt
go
wrong
if
you
like
dark
lagers
here
poured
a
nice
deep
chestnut
with
moderate
short
lived
head
nicely
roasted
malt
flavor
at
a
level
appropriate
for
the
style
just
a
touch
acidic
and
seemed
like
it
could
have
used
just
a
bit
more
sweetness
in
the
malt
according
to
the
label
the
beer
is
slow
aged
as
opposed
to
quickly
aged
i
suppose
grabbed
one
o
these
guys
last
year
after
xmas
break
decided
to
give
it
another
go
as
i
couldnt
remember
it
it
pours
a
clear
darkish
garnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
dark
toffee
rye
bread
and
dark
greens
the
taste
is
very
similar
heavier
on
the
rye
bread
with
a
deep
orangerind
bitterness
bubbling
up
from
beneath
a
splash
of
what
seems
like
cedar
makes
its
way
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
wet
feel
overall
an
okay
brew
but
nothing
fully
clicks
with
me
nothing
truly
offensive
though
drinkability
went
very
well
with
a
meal
bbq
sloppy
joes
and
fries
and
i
could
easily
have
one
ore
two
of
these
by
themselves
the
taste
is
interesting
and
grows
on
me
with
every
sip
very
nice
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
for
any
malt
fans
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
dont
judge
this
beer
by
its
looks
just
take
a
sip
and
start
the
enjoyment
overall
pretty
tasty
stuff
certainly
had
an
authentic
german
dunkle
flavor
though
not
the
subtly
and
smoothness
this
stuff
is
really
easy
to
drink
with
low
and
almost
undetectable
alcohol
wish
i
had
gotten
a
6
pack
instead
of
a
single
bottle
the
body
is
of
moderate
depth
carbonation
level
is
decent
good
crisp
feel
as
far
as
flavor
goes
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
they
really
nailed
it
where
it
counts
great
bready
flavors
abound
some
faint
molasses
and
plenty
of
chocolate
malts
this
reminds
me
at
times
of
a
chocolate
drink
very
welldone
i
could
have
another
no
problem
recommend
lots
of
flavors
but
light
and
low
abv
this
is
quite
good
well
balanced
and
well
done
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
probably
my
favorite
offered
by
my
hometown
brewery
thus
far
cheers
to
moerlein
for
this
dunkel
christian
moerleins
barbarossa
double
dark
lager
is
one
of
the
finest
munich
dunkels
in
recent
memory
its
also
something
that
just
about
anyone
should
enjoy
if
these
guys
dont
think
of
it
as
their
flagship
beer
they
should
this
wasnt
bad
and
its
drinkable
but
i
think
it
may
have
been
old
ive
heard
its
good
ill
review
again
in
the
future
with
a
fresh
bottle
value
perhaps
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
easily
as
good
as
beers
priced
30
higher
i
paid
under
8
00
for
a
six
pack
from
the
grocery
store
can
you
beat
that
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
transparent
dark
brown
with
a
modest
light
brown
head
the
head
disappeared
quickly
leaving
a
patchy
skim
of
bobbles
the
aromas
has
tones
of
toasted
malts
and
some
woodsy
hops
there
are
a
few
different
flavors
present
there
is
some
slight
coffee
bitterness
as
well
as
some
molasseslike
sweetness
the
beer
has
a
light
body
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
it
tickles
your
tongue
but
doesnt
distract
from
the
flavors
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
its
worth
picking
up
if
you
need
a
craft
beer
to
enjoy
over
an
evening
but
that
wont
be
the
center
of
your
attention
barbarrosa
was
a
seethru
medium
brown
and
had
a
tan
colored
head
that
didnt
last
it
smelled
malty
sweet
and
tasted
similar
to
the
aroma
sweet
grainlike
maybe
a
little
cola
flavor
barbarrosa
was
light
to
medium
bodied
and
had
good
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
id
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
the
only
other
munich
dunkel
lager
that
ive
tried
clear
dark
amber
with
a
slight
creamy
light
tan
head
that
quickly
shrinks
leaving
scraps
of
lace
behind
toasted
malt
and
raisin
make
up
the
nose
on
this
one
bready
and
sweet
maltiness
with
just
enough
mild
hop
bitterness
to
balance
nicely
medium
light
bodied
and
effervescent
a
decent
easy
drinking
dark
lager
not
a
bad
offering
certainly
worth
a
try
from
this
cincinnati
brewery
would
malke
a
decent
session
beer
drinks
great
body
is
solid
and
it
goes
down
smooth
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
in
my
book
well
done
drinkability
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
that
would
make
not
want
to
drink
it
the
flavors
are
nice
but
not
overly
robust
the
abv
is
more
than
manageable
and
the
price
is
right
as
moerlein
products
are
pretty
reasonable
barbarossa
is
good
clean
beer
and
there
is
nothing
to
knock
here
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
could
sit
down
with
a
few
of
these
drinkability
a
bit
reminiscent
of
ayinger
altbairisch
a
clean
malty
dark
lager
that
for
me
at
least
has
plenty
of
drinkability
appeal
worth
a
try
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
but
i
would
probably
choose
something
else
if
it
came
down
to
the
wire
i
would
suggest
the
great
lakes
blackout
stout
d
tasty
and
a
solid
beer
for
session
drinking
recommended
12

served
in

the

with
a

that
went
away

lacing

the
aroma
is
bready

theres
some
toasted

and
light
hoppiness
noticable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
with
above
average

drinkability
is

its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
could
have
this
as
an
occasional
session
beer
overall
its
a
decent
enough
beer
its
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
havent
had
it
before
d
my
favorite
so
far
of
the
moerlein
brand
it
is
very
available
where
i
live
so
is
it
quick
easy
and
tastes
good
if
you
are
going
to
try
one
moerlein
beer
skip
the
over
the
rhine
and
get
barbarossa
plus
added
points
for
having
a
cool
name
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
good
flavor
to
warrant
drinking
much
d
another
nice
offereing
from
the
moerlein
crew
not
as
good
as
otr
ale
but
still
solid
overall
not
too
shabby
good
drinkablilty
makes
this
a
sessionable
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
session
bmc
converter
for
me
one
and
done
since
not
much
flavor
at
this
stage
in
my
beer
drinking
the
taste
is
the
very
much
the
same
except
for
the
addition
of
a
faint
hop
note
overall
it
seems
muted
and
bland
to
me
however
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
happily
do
so
all
day
if
this
was
the
only
thing
available
smells
roasted
but
sweet
like
a
milk
stout
pours
to
a
root
beer
color
with
a
mutisized
bubble
head
that
holds
up
for
a
little
while
then
disappears
taste
is
sweet
and
marzen
like
then
has
a
tangy
hop
flavor
that
flattens
the
sweetness
but
with
only
a
very
slight
bitterness
subtle
chocolate
malt
notes
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
delicious
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
a
bmc
drinker
who
is
branching
into
craft
brews
delicious
id
like
to
clone
this
one
with
a
home
brew
nikki
medium
to
medium
full
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
decent
example
of
a
munich
dunkel
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
rich
would
be
better
if
it
had
a
little
more
depth
of
flavor
as
i
dont
really
get
a
strong
bread
crust
flavor
which
is
characteristic
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
great
drinkable
beer
goes
down
well
and
with
the
5
abv
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
this
is
a
great
lager
this
would
be
a
fantastic
session
beer
this
is
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
hell
yeah
this
is
a
keeper
i
could
enjoy
these
all
day
long
taste
is
much
the
same
but
i
get
a
little
sweetness
and
some
tobaccosmoke
flavors
as
well
medium
to
full
on
the
mouthfeel
and
creamy
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
cm
lineup
this
is
a
good
beer
with
nice
complex
characters
ill
certainly
recommend
the
barbarossa
to
my
friends
and
wish
i
had
more
than
just
this
one
im
thinking
this
double
dark
lager
is
a
champion
from
the
tap
this
is
an
unusual
and
pleasant
beer
to
quaff
in
the
evening
it
sports
a
lovely
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
beige
head
that
is
persistent
and
leaves
a
very
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
toasted
malt
but
rather
light
on
the
palate
this
is
a
malty
but
surprisingly
light
beer
for
a
dark
lager
with
hints
of
coffee
among
the
darkroasted
malt
overtones
the
finish
is
unremarkable
but
pleasant
good
mouthfeel
with
smoothness
and
solid
carbonation
refreshing
again
for
an
evening
beer
on
days
that
are
not
too
hot
this
one
pairs
nicely
with
a
good
serving
of
cincinnatistyle
chili
overall
pretty
drinkable
especially
with
a
robust
meal
thanks
to
zapata
this
beer
poured
a
very
clear
brown
with
a
14
inch
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
somewhat
cereal
there
is
also
some
slight
banana
scent
the
taste
is
sweet
and
big
of
malt
flavor
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
which
adds
to
the
overall
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
there
is
a
carbonation
bite
this
is
an
easy
drinking
well
balanced
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
with
sweet
dark
fruits
and
caramel
on
top
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
more
of
the
same
in
a
good
way
in
the
taste
with
a
huge
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
and
only
a
hint
of
the
roasted
quality
in
the
finish
hops
make
an
appearance
in
the
aftertaste
with
the
faintest
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
and
sweet
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
dunkel
and
a
very
good
beer
overall
notes
second
winner
in
a
row
ive
had
from
this
brewery
very
clean
and
drinkable
stuff
drinkability
oh
ya
easy
with
the
watery
feel
of
carbonation
though
not
bad
it
cuts
threw
the
dark
thick
intensions
imo
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
style
that
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
but
the
ones
i
have
tried
generally
are
too
light
in
the
flavour
department
not
so
with
this
one
highly
recommended
drinkability
very
excellent
example
for
a
munich
dunkel
style
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
one
for
a
session
i
may
do
it
before
i
move
back
to
the
great
north
drinkability
very
much
so
i
went
through
several
cases
before
i
finally
sat
down
with
one
to
review
right
up
there
with
otr
for
my
favorite
cm
beer
has
a
great
color
for
a
halloween
tasting
this
fall
very
very
nice
i
would
drink
this
by
the
literful
in
bavaria
notes
from
08
nhc
i
doubt
that
i
will
get
this
one
again
it
seems
more
like
a
bridge
between
a
vienna
and
munich
style
lagers
i
would
much
rather
go
for
one
or
the
other
d
a
fine
dark
lager
very
very
drinkable
for
me
i
just
enjoy
the
smoothness
and
malty
flavor
w
balance
of
gently
spiced
hops
in
addition
to
the
subtle
roast
to
me
this
went
down
great
and
could
be
session
worthy
for
sure
d
easily
drinkable
i
could
session
this
one
sweet
malty
nose
caramel
mostly
refreshing
for
a
reasonably
full
beer
more
like
medium
bodied
it
has
a
malty
taste
without
really
being
heavy
or
cloying
its
caramel
and
bready
notes
are
reasonably
well
balanced
by
a
mild
hoppy
bitterness
that
comes
and
goes
not
overly
complex
but
a
very
nice
beer
for
warmer
weather
final
thought
find
it
on
tap
its
a
classic
dunkel
prost
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
with
what
i
think
is
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
ill
drink
again
but
i
would
like
to
explore
the
style
much
more
before
coming
back
to
it
dont
really
know
that
much
about
this
particular
style
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
weakest
of
the
new
releases
that
christian
moerlein
has
come
out
with
d
tasty
and
incredibly
sessionable
another
good
brew
from
cm
keep
the
onslaught
coming
guys
this
has
a
very
nice
look
to
it
lacing
exists
from
what
was
previously
a
fine
cream
colored
head
but
now
receded
to
a
rim
of
foam
and
aforementioned
gentle
lacing
nose
is
a
touch
muted
but
what
i
can
detect
is
a
touch
biscuity
and
maybe
a
tad
nutty
taste
comes
punching
through
with
an
immediate
bitterness
that
gives
way
to
that
nutty
thing
that
i
could
smell
hints
of
something
spicy
and
just
a
faint
berry
presence
on
the
otherwise
crisp
finish
we
have
just
a
hint
of
tart
mixed
into
the
final
eff
you
attitude
of
bitterness
very
complex
without
being
too
much
of
a
thinker
havent
had
it
do
yourself
a
solid
and
give
it
a
whirl
overall
it
is
ok
to
me
i
noticed
many
others
rated
it
a
lot
higher
beer
of
the
month
club
done
good
im
a
fan
o
smooth
sweet
may
and
incredibly
drinkable
a
solid
american
made
dunkel
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
cola
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
bready
taste
is
toasted
malts
bready
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
very
good
dunkel
only
lack
of
lacing
detracts
from
its
appearance
otherwise
the
beautiful
clear
dark
amber
is
very
enticing
the
toasty
aroma
is
welcoming
the
toasted
malt
flavor
is
darn
near
perfect
and
the
palate
is
delightful
this
is
possibly
the
best
beer
penn
brewing
produces
overall
not
the
greatest
of
the
dark
lagers
that
i
have
had
but
it
is
decent
i
prefer
the
higher
carbonation
of
a
st
pauli
girl
or
heineken
but
this
one
probably
has
some
nicer
flavors
side
by
side
with
some
other
penn
stuff
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
small
off
white
to
light
khaki
head
aroma
is
nice
with
some
sweet
dark
fruits
light
toffee
chocolate
notes
flavor
is
a
lightly
spicy
chocolate
clean
finish
and
medium
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
low
plus
carbonation
a
really
nice
brew
that
could
pass
as
a
winter
warmer
or
a
fall
cookout
beer
id
have
this
again
mf
mediumbodied
semidry
finish
thin
low
carbonation
4
overall
very
true
to
style
and
thats
good
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
though
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
worth
a
try
overall
a
nice
rather
crisp
dark
lager
with
a
good
level
of
roast
coffee
and
nice
transitions
of
sweet
to
slightly
drier
flavors
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
no
real
flaws
but
the
fruity
character
is
a
little
offputting
no
real
complexity
and
a
little
overly
sweet
overall
great
beer
balanced
well
low
alcohol
and
easy
to
drink
combine
that
with
a
very
affordible
price
and
year
round
avaiblity
this
is
a
local
winner
for
sure
one
of
the
better
dunkels
out
there
edit
reworded
the
part
about
how
i
buy
beer
by
the
case
i
previously
said
24
oz
cases
which
doesnt
make
sense
proofread
your
reviews
before
submitting
lol
a
satisfying
nuttiness
noble
malts
make
a
late
appearance
as
this
beer
warms
that
adds
solid
balance
and
complexity
a
lot
to
like
here
if
you
like
the
style
this
review
is
based
on
the
newer
2012
batch
it
pours
a
medium
brown
with
light
tan
head
that
persists
during
the
session
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
aromatic
notes
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
a
quick
burst
of
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
vanilla
with
a
rather
polite
short
lived
bitter
after
note
i
still
like
it
slightly
better
than
the
locally
available
dunkel
from
sly
fox
but
not
enough
to
drive
for
5
hours
clean
and
easydrinking
nice
malty
flavor
without
being
too
heavy
dark
chocolatey
brown
in
color
with
amber
hues
and
a
deep
chill
haze
to
start
poured
with
a
rich
offwhite
foam
that
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
a
mellow
pleasant
combination
of
roasted
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
thick
but
delicate
malty
feel
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
flavors
up
front
and
into
the
middle
moderate
bitter
hop
flavors
are
introduced
in
the
middle
and
intensify
toward
the
end
only
to
taper
out
at
the
finish
finishes
with
a
delicate
roasted
malt
aftertaste
a
fabulous
dunkel
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
poured
into
a
pilsner
color
was
a
nice
medium
dark
brown
that
was
partially
transparent
had
a
nice
2
finger
cream
head
that
faded
to
14
inch
after
a
few
minutes
aroma
was
interesting
had
hints
of
fruity
sweet
as
well
as
sweet
grainy
bread
kinda
like
orange
flavored
oatmeal
bread
flavor
carried
over
the
slightly
sweet
fruity
flavorbefore
shifting
to
a
malty
note
and
then
finishing
with
just
a
tad
of
bitterness
was
a
bit
thin
and
watery
carbonated
well
but
just
seemed
too
thin
overall
a
good
beer
nice
subtlety
throughout
the
beer
poured
a
rich
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
dark
malt
and
a
hint
of
cherries
the
taste
was
toasted
malt
with
a
coffee
middle
and
a
cherry
finishand
all
with
a
wonderful
smokey
undertone
the
feel
is
medium
and
dry
i
really
like
this
beer
sort
of
like
throwing
my
best
pitch
and
they
caught
it
in
the
wheelhouse
d
another
solid
lager
offering
from
penn
brewing
co
out
of
pittsburgh
pa
good
flavor
on
a
really
drinkable
brew
although
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
it
out
and
i
would
recommend
getting
actual
german
versions
of
this
they
often
are
just
as
low
priced
if
not
even
lower
o
really
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
on
a
beautiful
spring
day
here
in
nyc
definitely
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
and
one
i
would
certainly
get
again
very
true
to
the
style
o
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
especially
given
all
of
the
malty
flavors
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
o
a
bit
lighter
than
i
personally
enjoy
but
it
seems
thats
typical
of
the
style
i
cant
say
ive
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
munich
dunkels
i
will
have
to
search
out
more
to
do
a
comparison
penn
dark
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
maybe
a
subpar
bottle
old
bottle
i
dunno
but
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
is
as
the
beer
was
intended
ill
pass
overall
superb
for
a
dunkle
sweet
nose
with
some
nuttychocolaty
tones
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
for
balance
very
drinkable
and
not
heavy
dark
dark
brown
beer
with
a
thin
foamy
head
aromas
of
toasted
chocolate
and
coffee
malted
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
the
caramel
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
lager
warms
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
example
of
a
dark
lager
its
almost
a
dessert
o
there
are
some
off
flavors
that
i
find
distracting
behind
all
of
this
there
is
a
good
balance
between
dark
fruits
and
breadiness
overall
the
best
beer
i
had
of
the
night
it
was
light
good
flavor
and
went
well
with
my
meal
if
ever
there
again
i
could
see
myself
ordering
a
couple
o
overall
a
pretty
decent
dunkel
nothing
mind
belowing
but
a
nice
malty
nose
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
little
spice
in
the
taste
would
try
it
again
overall
good
for
the
style
but
isnt
something
id
search
out
taste
is
simple
chocolate
drizzled
roasted
nuts
straightforward
and
never
gets
overly
roastyastringent
or
sweet
perfectly
balanced
lager
and
really
is
nice
this
is
probably
the
best
domestic
dunkel
i
have
ever
had
right
up
there
with
franconia
man
i
would
kill
to
have
this
available
locally
i
could
drink
it
all
day
love
me
a
good
dunkel
d
was
this
made
in
germany
penn
brewing
nails
the
style
this
time
with
a
great
flavored
easy
drinking
dunkel
overall
a
nice
bready
beer
i
do
not
find
this
one
boundary
pushing
but
rather
in
the
very
solid
category
i
could
have
several
of
these
but
this
is
also
not
the
first
beer
i
would
reach
for
o
a
pleasant
brew
i
would
definitely
have
another
this
was
sort
of
an
odd
beer
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
but
it
seemed
like
a
lot
of
things
were
off
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
sometime
serving
type
bottle
something
rich
enough
to
be
substantive
but
clean
and
light
enough
to
be
quite
drinkable
i
havent
had
a
proper
dunkel
since
germany
and
this
one
brought
me
back
properly
sessionable
for
sure
prost
d
very
drinkable
lager
well
balanced
flavor
and
aroma
very
smooth
for
a
darker
style
ale
loved
this
hard
to
find
one
that
wont
cost
you
a
mortgage
even
harder
to
find
the
style
done
right
in
this
country
minor
flaws
are
just
that
ill
look
for
his
again
slightly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
sour
mostly
darker
malt
flavor
the
hop
is
not
very
present
perhaps
only
to
balance
good
body
with
a
below
average
level
of
carbonation
not
extremely
familiar
with
the
style
but
a
pretty
good
beer
doesnt
drink
as
smoothly
as
other
dark
german
beers
i
have
had
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
dark
brown
color
it
has
a
pretty
good
looking
tan
head
on
it
the
lacing
could
have
been
a
little
better
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
roasted
and
had
the
typical
lager
smell
in
there
too
the
taste
of
caramel
and
bitter
coffee
were
upfront
on
this
beer
the
aftertaste
was
of
some
lager
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
enough
to
consume
several
in
a
sitting
if
you
choose
to
overall
this
beer
is
surprisingly
pretty
good
i
was
impressed
by
how
much
it
tasted
like
a
real
german
dark
lager
notes
i
am
happy
i
picked
this
one
up
a
tasty
brew
all
the
way
around
cheers

dry
hint
of
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
nice
roasty
flavors
with
lager
notes
under
all
of
it
a
decent
brew
goes
down
so
easy
but
remains
flavorful
throughout
nothing
earthshattering
but
one
that
you
can
drink
and
enjoy
without
contemplating
o
had
drank
this
plenty
of
times
before
and
knew
this
one
was
one
of
my
penn
favorites
wasnt
until
i
actually
sat
down
for
a
more
indepth
review
did
i
realize
how
good
this
beer
actually
was
its
quite
an
underdog
or
a
surprise
hit
pours
a
transparent
reddish
brown
in
color
tan
head
falls
quickly
to
a
wisp
and
small
ring
smell
is
dark
bread
molasses
licorice
a
good
aromatic
nose
on
this
one
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
it
finishes
with
a
nice
light
hop
dryness
body
is
light
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
mild
but
enjoyable
if
i
could
get
one
locally
it
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
could
session
this
very
easily
and
it
definitely
hits
the
spot
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
something
light
yet
dark
good
stuff
thanks
to
radioscooter
for
the
sample
i
liked
this
beer
it
gets
smoother
as
it
warms
up
and
is
light
but
full
of
flavor
i
found
it
more
enjoyable
than
most
dark
lagers
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
fantastic
drinakability
even
for
a
characteristically
drinakable
style
flavorful
and
straight
forward
without
becoming
burdening
after
a
couple
penn
rarely
misses
point
on
the
traditional
german
styles
which
is
sometimes
more
than
i
can
say
for
their
newer
american
styles
and
this
one
is
no
exception
md
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
and
sldes
down
the
throad
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
at
only
5
pct
abv
i
would
drink
this
in
bottles
again
but
look
forward
to
trying
the
draft
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
for
sure
but
i
did
feel
that
it
needed
a
stronger
malt
presence
and
a
bit
more
mouthfeel
i
would
pull
back
on
the
roast
malts
and
use
more
munich
d
it
is
nice
but
not
amazing
enjoyable
and
i
wouldnt
turn
away
if
offered
it
this
beer
tastes
to
me
a
lot
like
a
tradional
bock
its
very
nutty
crisp
and
pretty
refreshing
it
had
a
really
smooth
aftertaste
and
is
really
enjoyable
in
any
situation
overall
beautifully
complex
in
the
manner
of
a
good
german
beer
giving
you
both
a
big
bready
sweetness
and
crispness
in
character
as
well
nice
to
have
big
taste
that
isnt
a
13
barrelaged
brew
of
some
kind
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
the
brewery
this
one
will
keep
me
coming
back
to
them
cheers
drinkability
i
have
had
better
penn
darks
from
the
brewery
in
a
bottle
and
on
draft
certainly
would
try
this
again
because
of
the
freshness
not
sure
why
this
batch
had
a
creamy
mouthfeel
flatness
and
low
carbonation
drinkability
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
flavors
and
scents
are
really
enjoyable
lower
alcohol
helps
in
this
sessionable
dark
beer
nice
drinkable
brew
smooth
and
clean
finish
a
nice
nonoffensive
beer
that
would
make
any
beer
lover
proud
that
said
the
penn
munich
dunkel
lager
was
pretty
good
good
malty
aromo
and
flavor
but
as
expected
light
on
the
head
and
stomach
aroma
is
not
that
strong
flavor
is
ok
drinkability
was
good
but
i
dont
know
how
many
more
of
these
ill
order
smooth
medium
bodied
slightly
warming
in
the
throat
a
really
nice
beer
overall
could
quaff
several
without
any
problem
dthis
is
extremely
easy
drinking
and
has
a
pretty
good
amount
of
taste
to
it
definitely
a
solid
session
beer
consumed
382010
f
finishes
still
pretty
sweet
with
more
of
that
syrupy
flavor
coming
through
but
continues
with
that
nice
roast
flavor
and
more
of
the
crisp
finish
of
a
lager
it
doesnt
leave
any
real
off
flavors
either
a
nice
beer
especially
for
a
lager
style
which
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
this
is
a
great
session
beer
if
i
ever
found
one
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
slightly
tanned
head
little
bit
of
lace
along
the
glassware
nice
roasted
grain
and
malt
aroma
that
is
a
little
breadlike
with
a
slight
hop
character
in
the
tail
end
of
the
nose
taste
is
lightly
roasted
grain
and
slightly
nutty
malt
character
light
bodied
moderately
carb
level
and
a
crisp
finish
this
is
really
one
drinkable
beer
4
labels
it
as
a
good
sessionable
candidate
but
i
could
picture
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
too
quickly
my
first
penn
and
it
is
a
good
one
overall
a
pretty
solid
dark
lager
tasty
and
robust
despite
a
low
abv
d
pretty
solid
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
its
not
a
great
beer
but
its
definately
not
a
bad
one
review
from
notes
taken
on
9109
penn
dark
may
not
be
the
best
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
very
solid
brew
based
on
the
taste
price
and
availability
i
find
myself
grabbing
this
beer
more
and
more
often
its
especially
good
for
party
situations
when
i
know
im
going
to
knock
a
few
back
i
would
buy
this
again
when
given
the
mood
moreys
bottom
line
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
lagers
although
im
trying
to
sample
more
of
them
but
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
the
beer
doesnt
reinvent
the
wheel
as
far
as
dunkels
but
it
is
worth
trying
d
good
for
a
darker
beer
too
roasted
to
drink
too
many
but
a
good
balance
a
pretty
decent
and
easy
to
drink
dunkel
but
ive
had
better
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
khaki
color
head
that
measures
one
finger
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
that
are
very
sweet
much
like
sweet
bread
the
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
smooth
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
little
carbonation
with
a
smooth
finish
the
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
just
a
smooth
flavorful
beer
that
goes
down
easy
the
body
is
medium
to
light
with
ample
carbonation
and
plenty
of
character
to
make
this
something
worth
trying
overall
a
great
dunkel
that
beat
the
pants
off
most
macro
versions
of
the
style
this
cold
brew
shows
a
dark
mohagany
color
slightly
hazed
with
a
thin
offwhitelight
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
very
solid
brown
sugar
malt
and
some
yeasty
bread
and
grapes
the
flavor
brings
on
tart
apple
and
lots
more
brown
sugar
malt
it
has
a
decided
bite
that
lodges
in
the
back
of
your
throat
and
tongue
that
suggests
a
slightly
smokey
dry
light
citruscracker
kind
of
hoppiness
theres
plenty
of
smooth
carbonation
and
it
has
a
relatively
light
body
spritzy
and
refreshing
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
has
some
personality
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
pinch
no
problem
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
any
more
of
this
one
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
dark
chocolaty
brown
that
is
slightly
translucent
capped
by
a
fairly
thick
pale
tan
head
malty
slightly
spicy
aroma
has
a
hint
of
molasses
rich
malty
aroma
has
strong
tones
of
cinnamon
and
cloves
and
a
touch
of
caramel
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
quite
satisfying
drinkability
a
solid
brew
but
for
me
nothing
special
im
starting
to
believe
i
either
just
dont
have
an
affinity
for
many
german
styles
or
a
lot
of
these
domestic
breweries
of
such
brews
are
overrated
theres
flavor
going
on
here
and
i
could
drink
these
pretty
easily
but
i
dont
find
anything
more
than
above
average
that
i
want
to
keep
returning
to
poured
into
a
traditional
american
pint
glass
this
pittsburg
beer
offered
a
nice
clean
head
with
rich
dark
brown
hues
often
found
in
german
style
dark
lagers
the
brewery
is
consistent
in
their
beer
making
quality
and
this
dunkel
is
another
winner
with
roasted
notes
along
side
a
teethlingering
crispness
with
a
subtle
sweetness
and
enjoyable
maltiness
on
the
finish
i
really
enjoy
it
from
october
through
march
very
nice
body
and
fresh
taste
not
sugary
or
over
carbonated
very
enjoyable
quite
the
enjoyable
dunkel
lager
smooth
creamy
roasty
everything
that
needs
to
be
there
is
there
good
job
by
the
pbc
despite
its
flaws
overall
its
a
good
beer
that
is
pretty
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
ill
just
take
a
regular
penn
pils
over
this
anyday
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
felt
like
i
stumbled
upon
gold
with
this
one
and
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
and
again
i
think
i
found
a
new
favorite
the
bottle
says
if
you
were
going
to
spend
eternity
drinking
one
beer
this
would
be
the
one
i
heartily
agree
d
easy
drinking
beer

note
this
is
one
of

and
i
hope
that

keeps
making
their

they
almost
make
lawnmowing

to
look

to

i
get
a
peatysmoky
hint
yet
clean

mouthfeel
is
also
smooth
but
surprised
me
with
moderate
carbonation
which
doesnt
affect
drinkability
at
all
could
be
a
great
session
beer
a
really
good
beer
for
the
price
and
these
days
its
all
about
value
pours
a
very
dark
amber
brown
hue
with
a
one

fluffy
light
tan
colored
head
that
dies
down

a

one
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
putting
down
on
a
regular
basis
thanks
again
greg
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
one
d
a
solid
dunkel
worth
revisiting
nothing
completely
extraordinary
but
nonetheless
a
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
i
tried
this
beer
because
i
had
a
warsteiner
dunkel
at
an
outdoor
german
christmas
market
and
before
that
a
penn
pilsner
at
a
pirates
game
at
pnc
park
i
had
tried
neither
the
munich
dark
style
nor
the
brewery
before
these
two
and
having
liked
both
i
was
stoked
to
see
i
could
combine
them
the
result
is
impressive
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
penns
offerings
d
easy
to
pound
these
back
a
nice
session
beer
this
would
be
good
from
a
keg
if
you
wanted
to
get
one
for
a
party
just
like
all
of
the
penn
beers
ive
tried
this
one
is
extremely
drinkable
balanced
flavors
a
light
body
sessionable
abv
and
overall
tastiness
all
contribute
thanks
to
seanpachefeddffa
however
you
spell
it
for
the
extra
drinkabiliy
honestly
i
was
a
little
disapointed
with
this
one
drinkabilitynotes
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
enough
different
flavors
to
keep
things
interesting
and
the
light
body
makes
it
really
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
munich
dunkel
ive
had
but
still
a
good
one
seek
and
enjoy

a

not

on
the
palate
not
sure
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
this
one
again
i
drank
the
penn
weizen
not
too
long
ago
and
i
really
enjoyed
that
so
im
pretty
eager
to
see
what
else
this
brewer
has
to
offer
i
could
see
how
a
lot
of
people
would
really
like
this
though
it
packs
a
flavorful
punch
without
being
too
heavy
maybe
it
just
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
this
is
a
nice
example
of

my
favorite
styles
penns
dark
is

in
body
softly
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
d
good
everyday
session
brew
and
one
well
deserving
of
the
penn
name
the
first
of
four
penn
reviews
from
a
solid
classic
brewery
all
keystoners
should
be
proud
to
bear
our
name
this
is
very
drinkable
as
no
aspect
of
this
beer
is
overpowing
one
could
drink
several
given
the
5
0
abv
like
helles
made
by
this
brewery
i
was
expecting
more
given
that
this
brewery
specializes
in
the
classic
german
styles
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
rewarding
as
it
should
be
drinks
easy
but
ive
had
better
dunkels
this
is
a
great
dark
lager
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
pours
a
blackish
brown
with
a
slight
head
nose
is
roasty
and
malty
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
not
as
roasted
or
nutty
as
the
color
and
nose
might
suggest
actually
this
had
a
very
light
body
but
coinciding
with
that
was
not
much
a
flavor
punch
actually
this
be
could
be
a
session
beer
but
i
am
going
to
stick
with
just
the
one
thanks
to
johntravolta21
for
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
ok
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
well
made
beer
and
would
be
great
for
a
session
beer
penn
dark
is
roughly
the
same
level
of
quality
as
penn
pilsner
and
penn
weizen
that
is
decent
and
drinkable
without
being
a
standout
it
may
not
be
a
fair
comparison
but
st
nicholaus
bock
bier
is
still
the
undisputed
king
of
the
pbc
hill
as
far
as
im
concerned
d
very
good
as
well
possibly
my
favorite
micro
lager
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
it
seemed
a
little
heavy
where
i
am
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
2
in
one
sitting
d
an
excellent
lager
with
a
very
comforting
warming
character
owing
to
its
malty
nutty
and
toasted
flavors
with
enough
noble
hops
to
make
it
very
refreshing
as
well
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
and
this
is
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
enjoy
this
year
round
despite
its
autumnwinter
appearance
i
thought
it
would
be
a
little
more
robust
though
for
me
it
was
almost
but
not
quite
there
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
decent
drinking
beer
have
had
it
many
times
d
tastes
a
lot
better
then
it
smells
doesnt
look
as
good
as
it
tastes
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
but
its
a
nice
mix
of
a
lager
and
the
taste
of
heavier
porter
or
a
stout
all
in
all
i
think
this
beer
is
good
but
i
believe
that
my
expectations
were
just
a
bit
high
i
would
definitely
suggest
trying
it
again
the
freshness
may
have
been
a
factor
in
my
situation
very
enjoyable
beer
tasty
and
right
on
the
spot
to
what
i
would
expect
from
a
dark
lager
drinkability
not
my
favorite
dunkel
i
have
ever
tried
a
little
lacking
in
flavor
for
me
d
this
was
quite
good
i
look
forward
to
finding
more
from
this
brewery
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
solid
frothy
head
already
leaving
some
lace
on
the
glass
mild
aroma
at
first
sweet
bread
crust
and
light
nuts
and
caramel
rich
dark
malt
flavor
medium
bodied
clean
and
firm
some
earthiness
pretty
good
though
nothing
too
exciting
pours
a
hazy
medium
brown
with
a
head
that
pours
a
couple
of
fingers
high
and
then
sticks
around
as
a
swirly
cap
richly
malty
but
dry
with
aromas
of
bitter
chocolate
baked
bread
and
a
little
minerality
taste
is
quite
pleasant
but
a
little
light
more
of
that
bitter
chocolate
but
it
is
slight
and
way
in
the
background
slightly
spicy
grain
restrained
earthy
hops
and
some
more
baked
bread
flavors
round
it
out
smooth
relatively
light
and
an
anjoyable
drinking
experience
definitely
a
nice
and
drinkable
beer
id
buy
more
and
recommend
really
glad
i
tried
it
ill
be
trying
this
one
again
in
the
future
went
great
with
the
porterhouse
steak
tasted
on
32608
bottle
smell
is
cocoa
and
sweet
malt
hints
with
a
nice
background
of
floral
hops
and
honey
pours
to
a
sparly
almost
to
be
mistaken
for
cocacola
color
and
consistency
carbonation
seems
a
litttle
high
on
the
pour
the
taste
is
bittersweet
cocoa
with
nice
easy
bitterness
the
carbonation
however
seems
too
high
just
as
on
the
pour
this
beer
is
not
heavy
but
has
great
multiflavor
aspects
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
drinkability
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
it
is
something
you
could
drink
if
you
are
in
to
lighter

dark
lager
pours
a
dark
amberish
brown
with
a
short
fizzy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
mild
to
medium
of
malts
with
a
distinct
lagerish
aroma
taste
is
ok
good
for
a
lager
but
there
is
just
not
a
whole
lot
there
perhaps
a
little
lightly
malted
flavor
for
the
most
part
it
just
taste
like
a
typical
light
flavored
lager
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
with
a
medium
to
high
carbonation
drinability
is
ok
it
certainly
is
liquid
but
im
rather
bored
with
its
lack
of
taste
and
watery
feel
on
a
side
note
the
ba
tasting
notes
say
that
this
beer
has
5
alcohol
by
volume
according
to
pennsylvania
brewerys
web
page
it
is
only
4
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
short
and
light
white
head
that
settles
fast
and
laces
the
glass
pretty
well
all
the
way
down
it
had
a
sweet
roasted
malty
smell
not
much
else
the
taste
is
good
a
nice
sweet
malty
base
over
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
of
it
it
is
balanced
well
the
mouthfeel
is
good
very
smooth
the
drinkability
is
good
too
as
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
worth
a
try
mfd
medium
bodied
dark
lager
goes
down
easy
and
coats
the
mouth
well
ill
have
another
a
very
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
although
it
is
probably
a
little
too
heavy
for
session
drinking
pours
a
very
dark
amber
slight
haze
with
dark
mahogany
highlights
just
a
small
head
is
poured
that
is
quickly
dissipated
aromas
are
quite
spicy
a
bit
of
smoke
hotdog
like
roasty
malts
and
toasted
pecans
on
the
palate
the
deeply
toasted
malts
continue
bringing
along
toasted
multigrain
bread
more
smoke
strange
some
vanilla
and
an
oaked
feel
body
is
medium
moderately
sweet
with
a
medium
long
finish
this
is
a
tasty
style
easy
drinking
but
quite
filling
for
the
gravity
i
suppose
the
hallertauroasted
malt
combination
could
be
giving
me
the
sense
of
smokiness
penn
brewing
continues
to
make
solid
examples
of
german
beer
styles
recommended
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
good
decently
crisp
and
refreshing
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
its
pretty
solid
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
a
rich
brown
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
sweet
and
malty
in
smell
with
a
slight
coppery
scent
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
comes
to
the
front
with
the
malt
close
behind
easy
drinking
and
the
color
can
fool
the
lay
observer
this
beer
is
surprisingly
light
in
taste
and
drinkability
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
regardless
of
style
it
is
quite
enjoyable
and
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
d
this
is
an
overall
good
beer
one
that
id
drink
all
night
if
it
was
offered
as
the
special
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
to
buy
for
home
use
overall
a
solid
lager
well
made
and
highly
drinkable
description
seems
like
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
a
munich
dunkel
lager
on
tap
this
one
is
fresh
and
reminds
me
of
one
that
i
had
in
a
brewpub
in
bremen
germany
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
d
pretty
good
imo
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
am
really
enjoying
this
right
now
and
will
definitely
enjoy
the
other
2
i
have
definitely
would
recommend
trying
it
if
the
opportunity
arose
all
in
all
a
pretty
fine
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
it
could
easily
become
a
session
favorite
of
mine
if
i
had
constant
access
to
it
but
penn
beers
arent
found
in
as
plentiful
numbers
in
dc
for
some
reason
than
they
are
in
other
areas
but
i
would
definitely
grab
another
one
of
these
easy
going
brew
all
around
but
well
crafted
pours
a
dark
caramel
brown
like
a
can
of
pop
with
a
slight
creamy
looking
head
heavy
dark
malts
in
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
yeast
smell
follows
flavor
with
a
huge
roasted
malt
taste
slight
coffee
hints
afterward
medium
mouthfeel
lends
to
the
not
too
filling
feel
very
drinkable
and
excellent
brew
di
could
drink
this
all
night
very
nice
beer
nothing
is
so
assertive
that
you
would
get
tired
of
it
very
much
worth
a
try
an
easy
drinking
brown
hued
lager
with
a
onefingered
beige
head
body
is
light
to
medium
and
easy
on
the
taste
buds
light
caramel
sweetness
in
the
nose
as
well
as
in
the
flavor
add
a
slight
nuttiness
to
that
with
a
very
mild
hop
character
a
good
beer
pours
a
clear
but
dark
brown
much
ruby
showing
through
when
held
to
light
nose
is
mild
with
slight
caramel
attributes
to
it
but
overall
not
much
really
going
on
here
that
blows
me
away
flavor
brings
a
nice
and
deep
yet
smooth
ride
thick
malts
that
stay
consistent
slight
roasted
aspect
minor
nutty
tone
going
on
here
feel
is
very
good
with
carbonation
and
the
liquid
has
a
smooth
and
thicker
bodied
thing
going
on
another
very
good
beer
by
pbc
the
surprise
in
this
beer
is
the
notable
presence
of
the
alcohol
despite
an
abv
that
is
well
within
session
range
not
to
fear
though
the
effect
is
muted
as
would
be
expected
of
its
strength
or
comparative
lack
thereof
its
a
flavorful
easy
drinker
that
goes
down
smooth
and
makes
a
second
a
virtual
certainty
no
knock
on
the
bigger
brewery
but
this
is
the
beer
that
yuengling
drinkers
might
want
to
consider
graduating
to
wellenough
balanced
and
inoffensive
its
an
easydrinking
dunkel
lager
decent
beer
roasted
malt
powers
this
lager
but
is
balanced
well
with
the
subtle
hops
and
alcohol
but
the
maltiness
lingers
even
to
the
finish
smooth
as
can
be
i
found
it
oddly
refreshing
to
drink
well
balanced
and
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
thin
beige
head
with
decent
retention
stringy
lacing
roasted
malt
and
nuts
in
the
nose
medium
body
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
roasted
malt
and
caramel
flavors
along
with
lightly
floral
hops
the
finish
is
mildly
nutty
and
sweet
and
does
not
last
long
decent
overall
nice
dinner
beer
id
keep
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
in
indiana
a
good
beer
to
drink
after
a
long
day
at
hidden
valley
where
a
few
friends
and
i
would
drink
the
skiin
bar
clean
out
of
stock
days
after
there
shipment
came
in
similar
to
the
sam
adams
black
lager
but
much
more
viscus
smooth
drinking
and
an
almost
porterlike
taste
not
quite
that
thick
delicious
on
tap
or
out
of
the
bottle
a
must
try
if
your
ever
in
my
home
town
d
i
mean
this
beer
is
ok
but
not
something
id
buy
again
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
munich
dunkel
style
out
there
when
ayingers
roaming
around
this
arrived
with
a
big
deeptan
head
above
a
dark
brown
colored
beer
like
cola
with
ruby
highlights
the
nose
had
a
slightly
sweetish
aspect
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
approaching
medium
not
outandout
watery
i
perceived
notes
of
licorice
and
chocolate
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
lingering
with
a
semisweet
chocolaty
aftertaste
ooh
definitely
the
hoppiest
dunkel
lager
ive
ever
had
the
malt
could
stand
up
a
little
more
but
theres
still
a
nice
subtle
caramel
and
cocoa
taste
with
a
burnt
toast
edge
the
hops
along
with
a
lot
of
the
flavor
fade
as
the
beer
warms
they
were
grassy
and
funky
before
now
theyve
become
lame
as
i
finish
the
beer
frankly
this
beer
is
still
a
bit
bland
nice
and
plenty
tasty
at
times
but
a
little
light
on
flavor
full
bodied
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
some
grainyness
very
smooth
and
refreshing
a
real
crowd
pleasernot
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
all
nightbut
wont
complain
a
bit
if
i
had
to
clear
chestnut
colour
with
a
nice
reddish
brown
hue
topped
by
beige
foam
head
retention
was
alright
and
lacing
was
on
the
sticky
side
quite
nice
looking
aromas
were
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
a
hint
of
roast
with
a
pleasant
nutty
character
low
bitterness
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
mild
grainyroasty
quality
bitterness
became
a
little
stronger
in
the
finish
lightish
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
little
residual
sugar
left
behind
by
the
yeast
not
bad
at
all
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
without
having
a
full
malty
character
to
back
it
up
pours
close
to
stout
dark
brown
with
a
very
minimal
off
white
head
smell
is
minimal
malt
some
faint
chocolate
and
fig
taste
is
stronger
than
the
smell
some
malt
dried
fruit
minimal
molasses
and
coffee
very
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
lively
and
nice
carbonation
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
yummy
dunkel
overall
impression
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
very
well
done
a
malty
clean
refreshing
dark
beer
recommended
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
offwhitetan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
ok
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
and
some
coffee
but
the
aroma
is
on
the
light
side
luckily
the
taste
is
stronger
it
tastes
like
roasted
malt
chocolate
dark
fruit
molasses
and
coffee
body
is
lightmedium
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
as
it
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
good
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
id
recommend
it
to
others
to
try
overall
bought
this
on
a
whim
and
was
very
happy
this
is
a
session
beer
without
a
doubt
good
thing
this
is
easily
obtainable
in
my
area
this
is
another
highly
drinkable
lager
from
penn
its
well
balanced
and
tasty
its
dark
but
not
scary
this
taste
like
a
lighter
porter
dark
brown
body
with
ruby
highlites
and
a
nice
small
off
white
head
smells
like
funky
dark
malts
taste
like
a
lighter
porter
also
tastes
are
dark
maltand
not
much
hop
but
its
not
overly
sweet
mouthful
is
easy
going
down
and
the
carbonation
is
easy
also
not
much
of
a
booze
bite
i
like
this
beer
and
i
think
you
will
like
it
also
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
can
see
buying
this
one
again
drinkability
very
sessionable
beer
they
go
down
great
with
a
bratwurst
smothered
in

and

thanks
for
the
bottle
jasonm
d
drinkable
lager
with
good
character
its
a
musttry
in
the
pittsburgh
area
from
the
label
if
you
were
going
to
spend
eternity
drinking
beer
this
would
be
the
one
sets
a
pretty
high
bar
imo
not
bad
but
misses
the
eternity
mark
fairly
true
to
style
but
could
use
a
heavier
body
my
personal
opinion
is
not
enough
hops
but
i
say
that
about
almost
every
beer
now
an
easy
drinking
dark
lager
one
of
my
favorite
styles
will
be
drinking
these
for
years
i
dont
know
when
this
happened
but
penn
products
can
now
be
found
in
maryland
i
stopped
in
at
corridor
in
laurel
and
was
shocked
to
see
it
lining
the
shelves
no
more
long
treks
to
pa
for
beer
well
not
for
penn
anyway
to
the
uninitiated
youre
in
for
a
treat
theyre
all
great
but

is
by
far
my
favorite
regular
year
long
offering
from
penn
nice
dark
color
small
frothy
head
a
bit
of

and
a

thin
not
too
thick

is
mildly
balanced

and
toasted
malt
with
a
hint
of

enough
to
provide
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
add
just
the
right
carbonation
and
you
have
the
formula
for
an
amazing
munich

extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing

glad
to
have
a

to

thought

was
a
little
on
the
lean
side
but
i
suppose
that
is
typical
of
the
style
very
nice
brew
i
like
this
one
too
some
quality
lacing
especially
when
not
too
cold
pours
a
good
head
and
an
almost
opaque
black

heavy

dominate
the
initial
taste
with
a
twinge

probably
the
best
scented

penn
makes
also
a
great
session
beer
and
priced
fairly
tough
to
find
a
german

as
good
as
this

i
got
this
one
on

this
beer
has
a
nice

like
it
was
missing
something

this
is
a

you
can

im
sad
i
only
had
one
of
these
since
they
are
clearly
designed
to
be
drank
in
session
which
gives
it
a
shockingly
drinkable
quality
almost
like
having
a
cup
of
coffee
only
its
beer
this
is
good
stuff
the
drinkability
is
good
i
will
be
looking
to
get
more
and
send
some

lager
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
not
something
i
would
usually
go
but
this
one
panned
out
to
be
a
decent
offering
my
initial
thoughts
on
the
penn
offerings
from
the
pennsylvania
brewing
company
have
changed
considerably
an
enjoyable
libation
and
a
damn
good
dark
lager
clear
dark
brown
with
a
touch
of
amber
head
is
mediumsized
frothy
and
light
tan
and
slowly
diminishes
to
a
creamy
looking
thick
film
some
sparse

is
of
mildmoderate
sweet
toasty
malt
toffee
molasses
caramel
very
light
fruit
taste
follows
suit
by
being
sweet
up
front
with
dominant
malts
all
the
way
through
to
the
finish
a
touch
sour
but
not
bad
and
a
light
floral
presence
at
the
end
as
well
it
has
a
medium
body
creamy
texture
and
soft
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
nothing
fabulous
but
one
of
the
better
munich
dunkels
ive
had
so
i
have
to
give
it
higher
marks
for
that
reason
amber
rather
than
dark
colour
its
plain
but
its
drinkable
some
toastiness
some
hop
rather
taste
is
led
by
malt
profile
including
chocolate
malt
molasses
appreciated
than
no
sourness
medium
mouthfeel
part
of
the
german
style
lineup
and
nothing
special
i
brought
a
bottle
home
also
ill
rereview
if
i
disagree
with
the
ontap
review
cheers
i
enjoyed
this
beer
fresh
from
a
glass
at
the
penn
brewery
it
had
a
nice
head
and
was
very
dark
yet
not
completely
opaque
as
witnessed
when
i
held
it
against
the
light
and
it
gave
off
a
warm
blackorange
glow
where
the
light
passed
around
the
edges
it
had
a
beautiful
roasted
aroma
that
smelled
of
chocolate
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
full
of
body
and
plenty
of
complex
flavors
yet
at
the
same
time
wasnt
too
overpowering
with
the
bitterness
of
the
heaviness
of
the
drink
because
of
this
i
felt
that
it
was
a
bit
more
drinkable
and
could
easilly
be
followed
with
a
second
round
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumthick
with
a
mediumlow
amount
of
carbonation
i
believe
this
is
an
excellent
dunkel
lager
for
those
who
enjoyed
some
body
to
their
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
especially
if
you
can
enjoy
it
right
at
the
brewery
tried
this
bottled
beverage
not
expecting
much
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
nice
colored
drink
with
a
medium
head
the
smell
is
outstanding
a
roasted
dark
chocolate
smell
that
is
very
appealing
the
taste
was
amazing
like
drinking
roasted
almonds
dipped
in
dark
chocolate
a
nice
feeling
on
the
tongue
and
lips
similar
to
bass
but
with
much
more
flavor
i
was
definately
be
drinking
this
treat
again
really
a
neglected
beer
in
a
neglected
style
they
got
it
right
here
this
beer
from
penn
has
a
nice
brownishred
color
and
left
a
nice
head
smelled
almost
like
a
darkroast
coffee
bean
with
little
hops
present
even
though
it
poured
a
little
think
it
was
surprisingly
smooth
and
creamy
going
down
i
enjoyed
the
coffeelike
aftertaste
the
only
thing
i
would
have
to
say
about
this
brew
and
others
from
penn
is
that
i
never
know
what
to
expect
when
i
take
the
first
sip
it
seems
like
their
overall
consistency
is
lacking
lately
sometimes
ill
have
24
perfect
bottles
in
a
case
others
12
might
be
headed
down
the
skunk
path
this
beer
in
its
prime
is
excellent
though
easily
drinkable
itd
be
a
beer
i
could
buy
a
case
of
and
share
with
the
poker
buddies
on
a
saturday
night
nice
offering
from
penn
brewing
the
price
was
fair
and
this
is
a
decent
offering
it
just
misses
by
my
standards
a
bit
thin
and
some
odd
twists
and
turns
in
the
middle
are
a
rough
mix
pours
a
deep
rubied
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
quickly
to
a
sparse
coating
over
top
nose
is
a
nice
chocolate
and
raisin
mixture
over
a
toasty
bready
base
smells
very
nice
flavor
is
a
bit
different
first
flavor
is
a
nice
sweet
smokeyness
laying
over
the
toasted
raisin
bread
very
clean
and
nice
and
flavorfull
feel
is
on
the
light
end
of
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
damn
nice
brew
i
really
enjoy
the
flavors
and
aroma
i
like
how
the
smokeyness
is
not
so
big
in
the
nose
but
really
hits
in
the
flavor
i
would
keep
this
in
my
fridge
brewed
10
minutes
away
and
for
24
a
case
along
with
their
other
beers
i
feel
very
content
with
purchasing
more
poured
a
deep
rich
earthy
mohogany
with
a
light
tan
head
which
left
a
delicate
lace
by
the
way
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malts
and
roasted
toffee
the
taste
was
a
good
dose
of
the
german
minerally
taste
that
i
just
cant
describe
it
was
clean
faintly
bready
with
caramel
notes
quite
crisp
and
tasty
the
body
was
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
in
a
good
way
good
carbonation
and
a
great
first
step
into
penns
brews
im
just
getting
into
the
german
styles
so
i
will
revisit
this
after
i
have
a
bit
more
experience
in
the
style

interesting
pretty

just
having
the

along

doesnt
do
much
for
me
bottled

before
what

are
we
talking
about
cmon
brewers
out
there
we
can
give
better
info
wo
that

alright
my
ranting
is
done
this

murky
with

it
leaves
nice
fine
and
well
scattered

im
not
really
a

this
clearly
is
a
quality
product
and
a
worthwhile
sessioner
i
have
to
admit
i
am
such
an
alehop
fiend
that
i
had
to
adjust
to
this
all
lager
brewey
taste
is
smooth
with
plenty
of
roasted
malt
flavors
definite
chocolate
tastes
and
a
bit
of

the
right
amount
of
hops
all
around
an
excellent
beer
from
penn
brewery
penn
delivers
a
very
wellmade
and
exceptionally
drinkable
lager
in
their
dark
its
clear
deep
chestnut
body
glows
with
ruby
highlights
at
its
center
and
its
creamy
light
tan
head
holds
rather
well
before
dropping
to
a
standard
collar
and
leaves
short
splashes
of
lace
about
the
glass
dark
caramelized
sugars
and
munich
malts
dominate
the
nose
toasty
and
bordering
on
becoming
subtly
roasty
with
a
thin
cusp
of
chocolate
in
the
background
occassional
floral
hops
sometimes
make
their
way
through
the
malt
lending
to
quite
an
enticing
aroma
its
somewhat
creamy
and
fairly
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
finebubbled
moderate
carbonation
that
lends
a
light
zest
to
the
tongue
before
it
warms
dark
munich
malts
appear
upfront
in
the
flavor
mildly
toasty
lightly
sweet
and
even
somewhat
raisiny
as
it
warms
more
toasted
character
becomes
apparent
and
it
finishes
with
a
flash
of
floral
and
grassy
hops
as
its
drying
bitterness
rises
its
very
wellbrewed
clean
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
an
impressive
dunkel
that
probably
deserves
more
attention
than
it
gets
from
the
bottle
pours
a
amber
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
left
little
lacing
the
initial
aroma
was
fruity
and
then
nutty
but
as
it
warms
i
pick
up
malt
and
honey
it
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
that
finishes
dry
and
bitter
but
not
overly
intense
the
body
is
good
but
it
seems
to
slip
off
the
sides
of
the
tongue
a
little
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
dunkel
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
fluffy
2
finger
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
with
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
caramel
rye
and
spices
a
very
nice
complex
taste
with
mellow
hops
balancing
out
very
strong
malt
flavor
finishes
with
roasted
almonds
and
spices
with
almost
a
tart
flavor
a
nice
heavy
carbonated
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
good
malt
feel
once
again
the
pennsylvania
breweing
company
has
created
a
great
beer
in
a
luckluster
area
cheers
i
am
never
one
to
underestimate
a
dunkel
but
i
must
say
i
was
surprised
at
first
it
poured
a
bit
flat
a
slight
tan
head
color
was
nice
for
a
dunkel
but
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
undercarbonated
i
was
wrong
great
color
and
smell
with
taste
to
match
it
has
thay
nice
german
fresh
aroma
malty
but
tempered
a
rich
and
fairly
sweet
lagar
i
found
this
so
enjoyable
that
i
wanted
more
this
brew
has
a
wonderful
balance
when
you
want
something
with
texture
and
flavor
but
not
heavy
this
beer
is
great
with
food
not
overwhelming
at
all
drinkability
a
fine
effort
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
interested
and
light
enough
to
consume
in
quantity
i
love
this
beer
color
is
a
wonderful
dark
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
almost
opaque
with
no
light
behind
the
glass
nice
creamy
head
smell
and
taste
are
wonderfully
rich
toasty
malty
rich
chocolate
just
enough
hops
flavor
to
give
it
a
crisp
clean
flavor
nicely
balances
the
rich
creaminess
and
slight
sweetness
of
the
beer
unbelieveably
tasty
and
smooth
this
is
not
a
sip
and
discuss
the
subtle
flavors
for
hours
beer
this
is
a
holy
s
is
this
good
give

another

pours
a

there

tastes
earthy
and
a
touch
sweet

pretty
well
balanced

show
up

keeps
it
all

4
abv
a
great
dark
lager
pours
out
as
a
real
handsome
pint
with
two
fingers
of
rocky
sticky
head
just
leveling
off
at
the
top
of
the
glass
head
subsides
with
some
nicelooking
clumps
and
pretty
good
cling
a
few
streamers
of
carbonation
shoot
through
this
brews
nice
glowing
chestnut
translucence
that
shows
maplecolored
highlights
aroma
is
clean
but
not
particularly
distinctive
buttered
wheat
bread
with
a
sweet
caramel
maltiness
that
is
slightly
hullish
very
light
nosefeel
flavor
comes
in
the
form
of
more
caramel
sweet
malt
up
front
a
full
barley
backbone
complemented
by
butterscotch
in
the
body
the
finish
posesses
the
buttery
hallertau
hops
that
seem
to
be
characteristic
of
this
brewery
nicely
carbonated
light
mouthfeel
can
get
a
bit
syrupy
imo
sticky
refreshing
finish
drinkability
is
about
as
high
as
it
gets
a
result
of
the
balance
of
flavor
to
body
to
alcohol
if
i
can
find
this
on
tap
ill
be
drinking
it
by
the
pitcher
ive
drank
a
lot
of
penn
darks
mostly
on
tap
over
the
years
but
havent
done
a
review
since
ive
joined
b
a
so
thanks
to
p
d
for
the
bottle
clear
dark
amber
appearance
head
is
light
brown
and
frothy
like
steamed
milk
on
a
latte
laces
are
mostly
rings
with
some
interconnecting
tendrils
malty
aroma
biscuity
with
some
sense
of
light
honey
texture
is
fun
if
lighter
some
mediumtoasted
graininess
plays
in
concert
with
a
solid
if
noncomplex
caramel
flavor
the
finish
is
best
dries
slightly
with
welldone
hop
balance
just
a
solid
dark
lager
brings
back
the
memories
poured
a
dark
amber
color
and
was
almost
brown
and
was
topped
off
with
a
thinning
white
head
slight
hint
of
roasted
grains
in
the
aroma
but
overall
not
much
there
theres
a
buttery
texture
in
the
flavor
buttery
and
bitter
with
a
dry
bite
not
bad
for
a
dark
lager
dark
brown
color
medium
head
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
slightly
sweet
a
medium
bodied
dunkel
malts
are
roasted
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
raisins
plums
and
cherries
being
the
dominant
flavors
hops
are
slightly
bitter
and
a
touch
citrusy
nicely
balanced
a
very
drinkable
tasty
beer
would
be
a
great
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
smooth
and
a
touch
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
mediumdark
brown
that
when
held
to
the
light
had
a
reddish
hue
to
it
and
was
very
clear
the
head
that
it
produced
was
a
light
tanbeige
head
that
was
fairly
dense
and
decent
staying
power
and
left
some
lace
behind
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
sweet
caramel
malt
hops
and
some
spices
cinnamon
the
flavors
were
of
dark
malts
sweet
caramel
hops
roasted
nuts
and
some
spices
some
aftertaste
of
caramel
and
nuts
were
left
behind
this
was
a
crisp
and
clean
beer
decent
body
and
flavors
that
seemed
to
match
and
combine
well
a
good
drinkable
beer
the
smoky
malt
dominates
the
palate
but
still
allow
for
some
crispness
expected
from
a
lager
hops
are
subtle
and
the
aftertaste
is
of
smoke
with
some
sweetness
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
some
ruby
huesnice
rocky
head
that
sticks
around
smell
was
faintly
malty
and
fruity
taste
was
of
of
chocolate
malts
and
a
little
caramelly
with
some
lingering
dryness
much
better
than
alot
of
the
german
styles
i
have
hadvery
appetizing
and
sustaining
taste
is
full
slightly
sweet
at
first
with
a
nice
dark
malt
and
caramel
flavor
again
the
dark
bread
flavor
comes
to
the
forefront
followed
by
some
gentle
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
spice
overall
an
extremely
well
balanced
and
dangerously
drinkable
lager
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
can
envision
big
tankards
of
this
being
enjoyed
enmass
at
some
festival
with
buxom
waitresses
and
sausages
and
a
big
stupid
grin
on
everyones
face
nicely
done
i
must
say
that
in
the
past
i
have
boughten
a
whole
case
of
this
stuff
and
believe
me
that
case
was
worth
it
each
one
of
those
beers
were
fully
enjoyed
by
all
so
now
its
time
to
return
to
this
old
favorite
and
break
it
down
appears
a
very
dark
nearly
opaque
with
hints
of
ruby
piercing
through
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
paired
with
a
tan
moccha
head
which
is
binding
to
the
rim
of
the
forming
even
annular
rings
of
lace
as
the
glass
empties
the
aroma
has
some
semifaint
fruit
tones
wrapped
in
a
mild
milk
chocolate
bringing
creamy
malt
to
the
forefront
also
some
of
the
darker
roasted
malts
are
also
doing
their
part
allowing
a
toasted
nut
scent
to
dance
in
the
air
the
taste
leaves
me
with
that
creamy
milk
chocolate
sweetness
around
my
lips
along
with
the
trickled
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
tones
comes
a
crisp
smooth
lagerlike
characteristic
making
this
one
amazingly
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
full
of
those
creamy
sensations
down
the
palate
of
this
fairly
heavy
bodied
beer
drinkability
i
would
love
to
find
this
on
tap
just
to
see
if
it
gets
any
frothier
than
it
already
is
and
i
would
like
to
experiment
with
mixing
this
with
some
lindemanns
framboise
big
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
the
2
penn
samples
he
shared
with
me
drinkability
an
excellent
lager
im
not
usually
one
for
this
style
of
beer
but
penns
dark
has
carved
a
niche
in
my
heart
with
just
a
slight
aftertaste
this
one
is
very
easy
to
keep
drinking
a
pleasant
surprise
from
the
folks
at
penn
this
beer
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
ample
just
off
white
head
that
stayed
atop
the
beer
for
a
long
while
that
is
where
the
good
story
ends
i
might
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
but
the
aroma
is
very
mild
and
barely
any
malt
the
taste
is
bland
and
in
no
way
could
i
call
this
complex
there
are
no
chocolate
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
american
lager
light
i
will
be
trying
the
other
two
bottles
i
have
of
this
beer
sometime
and
may
reevaluate
this
beer
but
this
bottle
really
sucks
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
heavy
thick
foamy
head
the
smooth
aroma
of
bread
and
chocolate
is
very
inviting
and
quite
malty
to
boot
initial
earthy
bread
malt
and
sharp
bitterness
that
quickly
trails
off
into
a
dry
finish
very
drinkable
but
not
extremely
flavorful
pours
with
a
thinnish
head
and
hardly
any
lace
dark
root
beer
color
malts
are
up
front
and
hops
are
hardly
noticable
but
there
is
a
very
slightly
hoppy
finish
this
lager
is
a
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
very
drinkable
and
nice
to
get
a
good
dunkel
brewed
in
the
us

appearance
pours
a
rich
chestnut
color
with

hues
the
head
is
creamy
and
tan
in

holds
decent
then
fades
to
a
nice
thin
layer
of
creamy
foam
on
the
nose
the
aroma
of
roasted
malts
dark
toasted
bread
and
hints

what
a
great
brew
btw
the
bottle
is
almost
gone
in
the
time
it
took
to
write
this
short
review
wow
what
a
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
red
it
had
a
relatively
small
head
but
it
stuck
around
for
a
while
the
smell
was
full
of
malt
with
some
hint
of
hops
very
slight
possible
nut
aroma
mixed
in
somewhere
too
the
lager
had
a
very
very
nice
rich
taste
lots
of
malt
with
good
addition
of
hops
and
almost
strange
roastedlike
qualities
good
mouthfeel
with
a
somewhat
stickly
medium
to
full
body
almost
as
filling
as
a
stout
only
with
a
lighter
body
penn
dark
is
a
very
enjoyable
lager
the
wonderful
taste
goes
well
with
a
nice
warm
feel
in
your
gullet
great
session
beer
too
highly
recommended
dangerously
drinkable
deep
dark
brown
with
a
darker
hue
nice
off
white
head
and
moderate
lace
slight
hoppy
bitter
foretaste
but
mostly
a
rich
roasted
matly
flavor
taste
is
almost
shot
from
the
hip
as
aroma
is
not
very
fragerant
notes
of
semisweet
notes
similiar
to
the
chicory
flavors
of
dogfish
heads
chicory
stout
come
out
as
brew

is
slightly
chewy
and
well
balanced
on
the
tonguemoderate
carbonation
attributes
to
that
at
first
this
brew
reminded
me
very
much
of
yuenglings
lager
but
as
i
tasted
it
it
differentiated
itself
quite
nicely
nice
malt
flavors
up
front
with
a
smooth
buttery
finish
without
the
bite
the
yuengling
has
a
great
drinking
brew

i
will
have
to
try
to
find
locally

rich

a
little

well
balanced
and

overall
this
beer
just
feels
a
bit
lacking
to
me
definitely
not
the
best
example
of
a
munich
dunkel
that
ive
had
and
one
that
could
benefit
from
slightly
more
assertive
flavors
still
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
that
drinks
more
like
an
american
amber
lager
than
a
munich
dunkel
full
body
for
style
and
a
nice
lager
smoothness
ooverall
a
very

this

i
enjoyed
it
pours
a

with
a

that
settles
to

of
the

down
smell

taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
solid

easy
to
drink
brew
with
some
decent

flavor
with

overall
surly
has
done
a
good
job
with
a
style
that
is
mostly
ignored
on
these
shores
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a

nice

blend
well

the
skill

the
ultimate

beer
expert
brewing
passed
over
to
me
with
a
finger
of
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
very
pretty
ruby
red
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
chocolaty
aspect
to
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
chocolaty
smoky
taste
on
the
tongue
this
from
a
lager
wow
color
me
impressed
finish
had
a
chocolate
flavor
with
a
slight
sourness
leaving
it
moderately
dry
what
a
find
overall
despite
the
mild
aroma
and
slightly
too
sweet
body
this
is
pretty
damn
good
for
a
dunkel
while
not
my
favorite
surly
by
a
long
shot
i
have
to
appreciate
what
they
have
accomplished
here
o
easy
drinking
beer
well
balanced
and
smooth
great
sessional
beer
nice
coffee
and
malt
notes
with
some
nice
hops
added
in
solid
beer
but
would
not
rank
among
my
top
favorites
from
surly
finally
got
to
try
the
schadenfreude
at
the
hanger
room
its
not
as
inyourface
as
most
surly
brews
but
still
is
wellmade
and
tasty
for
what
it
is
a
nice
compliment
to
surly
hell
a
very
solid
beer
dominated
by
the
malts
as
it
should
be
but
with
nice
rich
flavors
and
good
balance
o
i
would
try
this
again
any
chance
given
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
it
was
ever
bottled
i
feel
as
though
the
abv
may
be
a
bit
higher
though
shhh
its
our
secret
overall
a
very
flavorful
dunkel
i
like
the
coffee
roast
pretty
drinkable
as
well
good
beer
all
around
i
could
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
this
beer
arrives
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
bread
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
the
taste
is
fuller
than
the
aroma
with
a
lot
of
toffee
and
bready
malt
some
cocoa
powder
and
a
hint
of
wood
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
overall
not
bad
at
all
wouldnt
put
it
high
on
my
list
of
favorite
surly
beers
but
its
always
a
treat
to
try
one
of
their
beers
especially
a
lager
d
very
drinkable
brew
medium
bodied
easy
going
down
a
for
sure
brew
to
session
but
too
bad
that
it
is
only
found
on
tap
another
great
brew
from
surly
and
i
recommend
having
it
when
you
can
drinkability
an
easy
one
to
session
with
and
a
lot
of
flavor
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
another
winner
from
surly
o
went
in
on
this
one
not
having
a
clue
what
to
expect
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
pint
draft
at
stub
herbs
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
ever
so
slight
head
what
head
there
is
collars
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
a
light
tan
color
i
would
have
liked
more
head
but
it
seems
the
bartender
wanted
to
fill
it
to
the
brim
the
aroma
is
actually
quite
mild
with
notes
of
light
roast
coffee
medium
mouthfeel
i
would
guess
this
uses
maris
otter
barley
given
the
appearance
and
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
starts
off
with
a
very
slight
dark
fruit
flavor
a
touch
nuttiness
and
the
aforementioned
light
roast
notes
sweetness
sticks
around
the
whole
time
mild
bitterness
some
caramel
flavors
as
well
as
it
warms
up
a
touch
very
easy
drinking
like
notes
my
first
surly
looks
like
one
that
is
limited
on
tap
only
leave
it
to
the
superb
bavarian
lodge
in
lisle
il
to
offer
it
a
great
great
place
to
drink
beer
drinkability
i
could
have
several
of
theseand
would
have
if
i
did
not
get
in
right
before
the
keg
kicked
i
love
the
slight
oaking
this
beer
is
super
smooth
drinkabilityi
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
very
drinkable
and
goes
great
with
food
im
not
sure
its
exactly
spoton
in
terms
of
style
though
i
think
it
could
have
benefited
from
more
complexity
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
flavors
and
a
good
richness
it
is
drinkable
but
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
little
more
depth
or
support
to
the
dark
toasted
malt
bill
d
the
drinkability
couldnt
be
much
better
lots
of
flavor
with
a
nice
light
body
and
a
nearly
sessionable
abv
surly
seems
to
do
the
high
flavor
low
alcohol
thing
very
well
m
d
very
good
d
all
but
undrinkable
i
usually
like
surly
products
but
this
one
really
misses
the
mark
d
pretty
easy
to
get
down
and
could
do
it
again
dont
think
i
could
make
it
a
session
beer
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
drink
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
d
overall
another
good
beer
from
the
folks
at
surly
lighter
bodied
with
a
full
flavor
makes
this
one
both
sessionable
and
great
with
food
and
while
this
is
not
my
preferred
style
of
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
thoroughly
oddly
i
felt
this
one
had
more
smoke
character
than
surlys
smoke
o
i
hope
this
ends
up
as
a
canned
offering
because
its
delicious
and
drinkable
ive
maybe
only
had
one
other
dunkel
lager
so
im
not
quite
versed
in
the
style
but
whether
or
not
this
is
very
traditional
its
damn
good
very
drinkable
would
love
to
try
this
again
this
one
where
one
pint
begs
for
another
an
excellent
session
choice
i
actually
find
myself
not
yearning
for
a
hoppier
brew
or
one
stronger
in
alcohol
although
ill
probably
have
one
of
those
anyway
knowing
me
as
i
do
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
inoffensive
beer
not
all
that
flavorful
and
for
my
id
much
rather
have
mild
same
sort
of
profile
loosely
i
just
need
bigger
flavors
and
a
dunkel
lager
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
glad
i
got
to
try
though
i
has
this
on
tap
at
local
option
into
a
tulip
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
lots
of
amber
highlights
fairly
clear
not
much
head
or
retention
to
comment
on
the
aroma
is
light
bready
with
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
ok
nothing
special
a
light
smoke
finish
that
is
nice
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
feel
kinda
boring
so
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
d
very
drinkable
but
i
think
i
would
rather
have
the
surly
mild
very
nice
refreshing
and
overly
drinkable
large
amounts
of
moderately
sweet
creamy
earthy
malts
chocolate
and
yeasty
flavors
endless
drinking
possibilities
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
toasted
malt
and
tobacco
leaf
that
also
came
through
in
the
taste
aftertaste
had
some
residual
earthy
hops
that
were
only
mildly
bitter
after
a
good
quaff
the
dark
malts
were
on
showcase
there
was
a
hint
of
maple
sweetness
also
feel
was
light
it
was
easily
worth
having
a
couple
pints
of
overall
it
was
clean
and
fairly
subdued
though
enjoyable
d
i
drank
a
pint
during
an
inning
of
the
cubsbraves
game
other
than
the
somewhat
harsh
carbonation
this
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
nice
dunkel
lager
similar
to
denisons
but
with
a
less
potent
nose
aroma
is
toasted

dark

but

aftertaste
a
excellent
example
of
the
style
the
most
wellbalanced
beer
ive
ever
had
easy
to
drink
yet
sweet
nutty
and
hoppy
you
cant
beat
a
wellbalanced
beer
a
solid
very
drinkable
munich
dunkel
for
sure
this
one
was
another
very
nice
beer
from
the
brewery
im
not
entirely
sure
but
my
thinking
is
that
last
years
came
out
slightly
better
but
this
one
is
still
an
excellent
beer
and
one
well
worth
picking
up
the
taste
was
a
sweet
and
nutty
one
but
certainly
wasnt
overdone
and
managed
to
strike
a
great
balance
as
i
sipped
away
at
it
for
quite
some
time
good
stuff
overall
an
excellent
brew
highly
recommended

a

that
settles
down
to
about
23mm
after
a
good
bit
lots
of
stick
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
sugary
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
caramel
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
with
some
molasses
as
well
as
some
dark
fruit
in
the
mix
very
tasty
and
smooth
brew
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
which
isnt
too
much
for
this

really
like
this
one
straightforward
dunkel
but
also
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
was
first
produced
over
150
years
ago
i
wonder
how
this
licensed
version
brewed
in
brazil
compare
to
the
german

by
the

it

the

in

followed
by
a

builds

with

overall
a

delicious
lager
that
could
only
come
from

here
in

this
is
not
an
easy
beer
to
find
jagerhaus
in
anaheim
sells
it
in
the
bottle
or
on
tap
go
find
some
its
worth
the
effort
o
this
is
a
beer
with
some
good
qualities
that
doesnt
quite
make
it
not
the
worst
dunkel
ive
had
but
not
the
best
either
decent
dunkel
lager
coffee
and
caramel
flavor
easy
to
drink
not
too
much
carbonation
o
it
is
an
extremely
solid
lager
highly
recommended
i
think
this
is
a
much
better
than
average
dunkel
with
more
flavor
while
retaining
that
soft
mellow
sensation
this
would
be
the
one
to
fill
your
big
stein
with
from
the
500

bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
seattle
nice

really
drinkable
and
rich

a

with

the

is
inviting
with
toasted

this

highly
drinkable
with
a
smooth

and
a
decent

taste
that
is
perfect
for
the
style
very
well
made
and
delicious
o
the
bottle
claims
its
das
beste
dunkel
der
welt
certainly
an
overstatement
but
not
an
utterly
gross
exaggeration
this
is
a
very
good
dunkel
well
worth
the
drink
and
although
there
are
better
dunkels
in
germany
it
is
a
nice
and
balanced
beer
with
pretty
even
overtones
for
the
most
part
good
not
great
not
as
october
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
but
still
a
tasty
brew
quintessentially
german
in
every
way
the
pours
is
clear
for
the
genre
lacey
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
a
deep
ruby
color
and
a
nose
of
german
amber
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
smells
also
like
warm
fermentation
for
a
lager
a
little
acidic
and
funny
for
some
reason
but
not
unattractive
notes
of
lager
yeast
and
semisweet
amber
come
though
toffee
in
the
finish
with
not
quite
enough
hops
to
balance
yeasty
and
bold
flavored
i
wish
it
wasnt
quite
so
sugary
on
the
back
end
but
a
drinkably
dark
german
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
decently
carbonated
a
little
bland
in
the
mouth
but
a
good
beer
overall
especially
for
the
price
delicious
great
the
label
is
marked
with
world
beer
cup
gold
award
well
ive
no
idea
what
that
is
but
if
it
is
as
the
name
infers
im
not
hugely
surprised
overall
another
great
german
brew
although
they
are
starting
to
run
together
in
a
similar
groove
not
the
commercial
hofbrau
malts
but
a
shade
of
variance
a
great
standard
o
delicous
piece
of
history
that
should
be
tried
would
go
well
with
dark
rye
or
pumpernickel
breads
with
whipped
butter
or
with
light
cheeses
saw
it
overpriced
in
china
got
this
one
slightly
cheaper
in
the
us
great
german
beer
probably
the
best
munich
dark
lager
ive
ever
had
a
touch
of
metallic
character
is
offputting
but
otherwise
it
is
a
solid
brew
easydrinking
beer
that
would
probably
rise
and
fall
repeatedly
without
becoming
tiresome
deep
into
a
social
evening
filled
with
talk
and
laughter
overall
i
had
a
feeling
the
germans
can
make
a
kick
ass
dunkel
and
it
was
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
seek
out
if
you
can
the
beer
poured
an
amazing
translucent
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
hints
of
coffee
over
a
sweet
malt
base
the
taste
is
a
rich
sweet
malt
with
touches
of
coffee
and
chocolate
on
top
of
that
the
feel
is
medium
and
wet
this
was
a
great
example
of
a
dunkel
rich
a
full
bodied
taste
with
some
great
flavors
in
it
this
is
a
dunkel
i
will
come
back
to

medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
with
mediumhigh
levels
of
carbonation
that

the
beer
up
substantially
on

resulting
mouthfeel
is
at
first
fizzy
then
smooth
and
creamy
finishes
wet
with
little
residual
stickiness
around

or
lips
o
a
flawless
albeit
straightforward
bavarian
dunkel
make

pilgrimage
o

bit
too
sweet
but
nice

a
fair
enough
dark
lager
smooth
and
lightly
flavored
dark
beer
thats
easy
drinking
nice
balance
with
the
roasted
flavors
and
the

pretty
good
for
a
rauchbier
2nd

not
great

some

enjoyable
overall
superbly
easy
to
drink
dunkel
if
you
are
looking
for
a
nice
malty
dunkel
this
one
hits
the
spot
drinkability
this
is
very
good
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
and
it
also
offers
a
ton
of
complexity
really
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
sweet
great
dunkel
great
flavors
for
4
7
and
extremely
drinkable
o
a
good
lightish
easy
to
drink
dunkel
pours
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
tan
fine
tan
head
that
lasts
quite
a
while
leaving
some
good
lacing
aroma
is
predominantly
chocolate
malts
roast
malts
and
a
hint
of
coffee
flavour
is
very
good
with
the
aromas
coming
in
to
the
flavour
mix
along
with
some
toffee
sweetness
and
some
slight
graininess
of
the
roasted
malts
coming
through
what
impresses
me
most
is
that
the
body
is
rich
and
full
for
a
4
abv
beer
normally
there
would
be
a
hole
in
the
palate
range
but
this
is
spot
on
no
wateriness
or
thinness
at
all
finally
the
finish
is
quite
long
a
pleasant
mainly
coffee
with
a
touch
of
prune
in
there
o
a
very
nice
dunkel
that
was
very
easy
to
drink
overall
pretty
good
bears
some
resemblance
to
a
porter
but
not
quite
it
also
gets
better
as
it
warms
overall
an
interesting
if
not
particularly
complex
well
polished
and
rounded
lager
charming
to
say
the
least
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
healthly
looking
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
it
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
pleasent
it
had
a
real
nice
roasted
malt
smell
and
some
lager
yeast
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
probably
one
of
the
better
dark
lagers
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
then
i
expected
i
really
liked
how
it
almost
felt
creamy
overall
this
beer
had
a
great
feel
to
it
and
it
was
nicely
flavored
really
worth
trying
hell
i
want
to
try
it
again
sometime
do
low
abv
of
4
7
but
somehow
feels
like
it
drank
bigger
in
alcohol
and
flavor
for
those
that
think
low
abv
beers
dont
pack
a
punch
or
flavor
should
be
referred
to
this
beer
smooth
drinkability
with
a
light
dry
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
an
overall
flavor
character
suited
well
per
style
drinkability
i
love
the
dark
lagers
of
germany
and
czech
rep
this
is
a
great
examaple
o
probably
the
best
dunkel
i
have
tried
to
date
o
probably
the
best
imported
dunkel
ive
had
though
transport
and
probably
pasteurization
take
their
toll
on
german
imports
and
this
one
is
no
exception
when
you
compare
to
the
fresh
beers
in
bavaria
nonetheless
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
locally
if
you
are
a
dunkel
fan
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
munich
dunkel
lager
beer
is
medium
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
lead
off
is
sweet
and
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
and
bitter
interesting
its
like
a
doppelbock
but
thinner
and
weaker
overall
i
like
it
overall
not
sure
i
would
order
it
again
conclusion
this
is
the
first
higher
quality
example
of
this
style
that
i
have
tasted
and
i
find
it
enjoyable
i
can
imagine
this
pairing
well
with
some
lightly
spiced
schnitzel
or
stuffed
cabbage
overall
what
an
excellent
beer
an
outstanding
example
of
an
excellent
style
that
i
drink
far
too
infrequently
d
this
was
pretty
good
i
had
never
had
anything
from
weltenburger
and
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
pretty
nice
dont
be
fooled
by
its
ba
overall
score
this
is
an
awesome
beer
especially
when
you
get
a
relatively
fresh
bottle
as
i
have
i
didnt
expect
to
rate
this
so
highly
but
apparently
weltenburger
barock
dunkel
is
just
what
herr
doktor
ordered
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
picked
this
up
at
hitimes
in
costa
mesa
always
a
solid
selection
poured
a
deep
brown
somewhat
chunky
head
big
malts
on
the
nose
ton
of
sweet
caramel
as
well
taste
was
very
smooth
complex
as
it
warms
but
very
drinkable
with
a
strong
malt
finish
good
stuff
drinkability
straightforward
beer
that
isnt
all
that
interesting
but
drinks
smoothly
i
enjoyed
this
one
great
great
dunkel
overall
really
surprising
a
beer
even
worthy
of
barock
obama
although
i
hear
the
prez
prefers
bud
light
that
sellout
dark
brown
dense
beige
head
excellent
retention
and
lace
an
almost
perfect
looking
beer
the
nose
is
delicate
and
complex
with
chocolate
bread
light
fruit
wheat
and
no
real
hop
character
beautiful
chocolate
bread
character
some
caramel
is
also
present
the
palate
opens
light
with
wheat
a
little
toast
chocolate
a
light
nutiness
as
with
the
nose
the
caramel
character
is
light
but
present
dry
and
clean
finish
with
a
light
body
and
crisp
carbonation
this
is
excellent
fresh
keg
on
tap
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
this
one
has
a
great
color
somewhere
between
amber
and
brown
reminding
me
of
chestnut
shells
two
inches
of
beige
head
tops
the
body
slowly
settling
to
a
collar
the
aroma
is
malty
toasty
lightly
caramelized
and
fruity
its
bold
but
clean
its
similar
on
the
palate
the
malt
profile
reminds
me
of
toasted
whole
grain
bread
behind
it
there
are
notes
of
dark
fruit
coffee
and
caramelized
malt
lightbodied
with
a
dry
and
toasty
finish
i
could
drink
this
all
day
might
be
the
best
dunkel
ive
had
drinkability
quite
drinkable
this
has
the
good
quality
of
being
a
light
yet
flavorful
session
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
mahogany
color
and
the
beer
poured
a
big
thick
pillow
head
that
was
brown
the
beer
had
a
breadyyeasty
smell
the
taste
was
malty
caramel
a
little
sweet
but
not
too
much
the
beer
was
a
little
watery
but
still
a
good
beer
i
will
buy
again
500ml
from
capital
market
salem
nice
dark
brown
beer
with
a
gorgeous
frothytan
head
very
bready
malt
aromas
bread
and
oat
cereal
like
it
smooth
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
with
boiled
milk
flavours
slight
hints
of
bitterness
in
the
end
very
smooth
silky
smooth
palate
overall
i
really
liked
this
soft
malt
driven
beer
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
before
i
seriously
cast
judgment
but
either
way
i
am
going
to
finish
my
beer
whether
it
has
a
bit
of
oxidation
or
not
and
that
is
a
pretty
bold
statement
as
i
have
some
seriously
choice
beers
lined
up
after
this
one

very

weltenbuger
kloster
claim
to
be
the
oldest
monastery
brewery
in
the
world
having
been
established
in
1050
or
ten
to
eleven
as
its
sometimes
called
though
i
very
much
doubt
that
the
barock
dunkel
bears
any
major
resemblance
to
whatever
the
monks
were
churning
out
then
this
poured
a
very
alluring
ruby
colour
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
and
lots
and
lots
of
carbonation
which
i
wondered
if
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
glass
as
there
were
streams
of
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
pattern
on
the
glass
bottom
at
first
the
nose
worried
me
as
it
bore
a
resemblance
to
the
detergenty
smell
but
eventually
it
gave
way
to
a
predominantly
ginger
spiciness
tastewise
this
was
really
nothing
special
lightly
malty
but
with
a
thin
body
it
was
quite
disappointing
to
be
frank
perhaps
i
like
big
beers
too
much
these
days
almost
1000
years
of
brewing

created
near
perfection

the

of
weltenburger
barockdunkel
has
a
dark
brown
color
but
certainly
not
black
with
a
large
head
and
good
lace
throughout
this
beer
is
considered
by
most
to
be
rather
plain
in
taste
but
the
traces
of
chocolate
provide
a
solid
uncomplicated
taste
it
has
a
great
full
body
and
i
miss
being
able
to
pick
up
20
bottles
of
this
at
a
time
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
and
everyone
who
is
interested
in
dark
german
beer
visiting
the
brewery
itself
is
an
amazing
experience
d
very
rich

without
being
overbearing
i
will
drink
this

good
sessionable
beer
probably
a
good
alternative
for
a
brown
ale
if
one
is
looking
for
something
different
recommended
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
being
very
familiar
with
the
style
i
am
very
glad
i
picked
this
up
and
will
wait
until
it
cools
a
bit
outside
to
pick
up
some
more
m
d
effervescent
and
light
a
smooth

and
a
very
easy
drinker
with
the
mellow
abv
its
an
easy
session
candidate
and
would
perform
well
as
such
the
style
seems
to
fly
below
the
radar
a
bit
and
perhaps
undeservedly
so
its
a
fine
style
of
lager
and
well
worth
trying
out
reviewed
from
notes
while
in
germany
5208
this
beer
was
a
dark
brown
color
12
in
tan
head
that
was
more
like
a
thick
cap
there
was
a
light
roast
smell
but
more
noticeable
was
the
hops
the
taste
was
of
nice
dark
chocolate
hints
of
roasted
coffee
and
a
slight
sweetness
in
the
finish
this
is
an
after
dinner
beer
extremely
smooth
and
well
put
together
the
beers
body
is
ruby
brown
with
hues
of
orange
head
is
good
and
frothy
on
top
ill
bring
the
glass
to
my
nose
and
get
a
whiff
of
dark
malts
and
sweet
bread
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
so
i
can
save
myself
some
typing
okay
ill
add
this
similar
flavor
characteristics
to
its
doppelbock
and
thats
a
good
thing
body
is
medium
and
pepped
with
a
spring
of
carbonation
maybe
a
little
too
much
on
that
save
for
very
hot
weather
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
during
any
time
of
year
i
would
also
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
want
to
train
their
palates
to
withstand
doppelbocks
basically
it
is
a
near
perfect
beer
it
is
complex
without
sacrificing
drinkability
rich
and
full
without
being
too
thick
basically
this
is
why
i
drink
beer
so
good
flavors
were
mainly
caramel
and
almond
some
toasted
character
developed
in
the
aftertaste
a
metallic
note
came
and
went
not
present
throughout
fairly
light
bodied
good
malt
presence
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
not
bad
for
a
session
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
pours
an
extremely
dark
ruby
with
a
tan
head
that
rises
and
does
not
stick
around
long
but
leaves
a
thick
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
almost
like
old
wood
like
a
cleaned
out
old
attic
dusty
and
void
of
life
a
mild
bit
of
malt
character
there
but
not
a
whole
lot
flavor
is
smooth
and
even
nothing
real
crazy
going
on
here
thin
malt
influence
has
the
body
but
not
a
lot
of
character
to
follow
feel
is
standard
a
bit
thin
really
drinkable
sure
it
is
a
decent
brew
nice
to
try
but
no
home
run
to
run
back
to
overall
i
did
not
appreciate
this
one
too
watery
and
characterless
to
deserve
a
higher
grade
all
in
all
an
odd
beer
the
smell
is
definitely
offkey
and
the
taste
is
an
improvement
on
the
smell
but
not
by
much
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
it
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
taste
is
strong
malty
like
a
lot
of
munich
malt
has
been
used
a
little
molasses
and
roasted
notes
to
me
this
beers
body
was
a
little
too
low
but
i
read
on
the
label
that
this
beer
only
has
47
alcohol
and
this
beer
has
more
taste
than
the
average
beer
i
especially
like
the
combination
of
the
roast
and
malt
bitterness
is
low
and
drinkability
is
great
d
a
good
dunkel
not
as
good
as
the
ayinger
but
few
are
a
good
example
of
a
german
dunkel
easy
to
drink
id
buy
again
and
enjoy
d
not
quite
my
cup
of
brew
but
pretty
straightforward
a
nice
drinkable
dunkel
bordering
on
bock
alcohol
is
such
that
2
or
3
in
a
session
is
not
unreasonable
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
reviewed
this
once
before
but
after
a
massive
explosion
of
flavour
immediately
before
by
some
killer
beers
and
i
decided
to
revisit
this
beer
with
a
neutral
palate
this
time
i
really
noticed
the
deep
coca
cola
colour
and
the
creamy
and
persistent
head
its
a
beautiful
beer
to
look
at
and
the
malty
aroma
wafting
from
the
top
continued
to
the
end
the
flavour
is
a
complex
malange
of
dark
chocolate
coffeemocha
with
some
molasses
and
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
to
prevent
cloying
you
could
have
this
with
a
chocolate
mousse
or
creme
brulee
or
just
by
itself
for
a
nice
dessert
its
not
quite
a
full
bodied
beer
despite
appearances
and
can
seem
watery
after
a
fuller
beer
but
it
stands
up
as
a
well
balanced
and
very
complex
dessert
beer
i
think
you
could
only
have
one
or
two
before
becoming
palate
fatigued
so
its
not
exactly
a
bbq
quaffer
it
is
a
fabulous
drop
all
the
same
drinkability
decent
drinkability
but
slight
bitter
finish
slows
you
down
some
the
drinkability
is
good
a
very
easy
drinker
prosit

my
guess
is
this
would
kick
ass
fresh

aroma
is
a
pleasnt
mixture
of
roasted
nuts
and
dark
fruit
with
malty
sweet
undertones
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
nutty
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
fruit
body
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
which
accounts
for
a
weak
mouthfeel
and
short
finish
that
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
but
still
enjoyable

beer
is

surprisingly
clear
and
loaded

aroma
is

malt
fairly
sweet
and
reminiscent

a
doppelbock
moderately
sweet
malt
with
just
a
bit
of
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
just
a
bit
of
fizz
from
the
carbonation
sweetness
fades
in
the
finish
and
leaves
with
a
bready
cocoa
flavor
there
is
something
about
the
mix
between
the
aroma
and
the
taste
that
follows
that
makes
this
beer
above
average
at
less
than
5
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
it
has
all
the
characteristics
i
love
about
doppelbocks
but
a
much
lower

tastes
good
as
you
would
expect
after
admiring
the
nice

its
not
spectacular
but
it
really
does

some

i
poured
it

cheers
this
was
a
pleasant
change

pace
as
dunkels
are

go
back
to
it

beer
poured
an
almost
seethru
brown
hue
the
color
did
not
catch
my
attention
and
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
but
the
smell
was
of
a
flowery
malt
with
a
delicate
hint
of
ice
cream

a

i

this

for

if
you
can
get
at
that
price
get
some
but
i
cant
see
paying
much
more
for
this
beer
ill
continue
to
stick
with
their

light

too

to
be

its
interesting
what
one
discovers
when
reading
the

on

side

fine
as
to
suggest
embarrassment
on
the
part
of
the

are

the

water
malted

hops
and

extract
uh
yeast
is
necessary
in
the
brewing
of

the
last
time
i
checked
hop
extract
is
an
affront
to
my
sensibilities
as
a
hophead
but
ill
try
not
to
let
that
adversely
affect
my
impressions
of
barockdunkel
bottom

this
is
pretty
close
to

although
the
freshness
date
is
4205
which
probably
means
feb
4
2005
since
this
is
brewed
in
deutschland
i
cant
help
but
think
that
this
bottle
must
have
been
sitting
out
in
the
bright
lights
of
world
market
for
way
too
long
or
maybe
the

means
1905
the
objective
reviewer
in
me
says
that
a
beer
cant
possibly
be
meant
to
taste
like
this
and
wants
to
buy
another
bottle
just
in
case
this
one
was
horribly
spoiled

great
aroma

is
that
of

nicely
transitions
into

are
very
nicely
done
the
maltiness
of
this
brew
gives
it
a
great
smoothness
while
it
is
kept
fairly
chewy
by
the
yeasties
and
is
also

carbonated
this

it

at
first
blush
i
though
the
chocolate
was
out
of
place
in
a
lager
but
soon
learned
no
matter
what
you
want
to
call
it
this
is
a
fine
brew
on
draft
at
capones
pours
a
deep

with

mild
chocolate
aroma
taste
is
mellow
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
subtle
sweet
malt
and
roasted
malt
finish
i
really
felt
this
lucious
brew
drank
like
a
porter
so
i
checked
out
the
cricket
hill
website
and
there
it
is
listed
as
an
ale
nocturne
chocolate
ale
therefore
i
have
to
assume
the
beer
advocate
listing
is
in
error
and
this
is
an
american
style
porter
as
such
it
is
outstanding
on
draft
and
worth
seeking
out
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
chocolate
some
coffee
as
well
taste
is
chocolatey
some
coffee
drinks
more
like
a
stout
than
a
lager
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
what
i
expected
but
a
pretty
good
beer
this
is
a
good
lager
quite
robust
though
and
almost
like
a
rauchbier
or
smoked
beer
consistent
and
smooth
nose
brings
a
somewhat
chocolate
character
would
probably
be
heavier
than
most
would
expect
almost
reaching
into
porter
or
stout
territory
well
not
almost
it
does
regardless
its
a
nice
beer
overall
this
is
a
well
done
beer
i
would
have
and
did
think
it
was
a
porter
when
i
first
had
it
and
liked
it
then
now
i
see
its
a
lager
and
give
it
more
credit
my
first
cricket
hill
i
have
ever
enjoyed
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
dark
lager
that
can
be
a
session
beer
great
nj
brew
worth
trying
out
i
will
definitely
get
more
if
i
am
to
drink
dark
lager
this
would
be
near
the
top
of
my
list
i
could
see
drinking
this
and
surprising
my
friends
with
it
but
once
the
head
settle
you
have
a
delicious
dark
lager
in
front
of
you
feels
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
while
not
overwhelming
with
flavor
is
just
perfect
for
those
november
nights
where
your
along
sitting
on
the
interneteh
thanks
to
steve
for
this
one
fix
that
and
this
is
a
winner
overall
drinkable
and
fairly
flavorful
but
not
really
a
great
representative
of
the
style
d
based
on
the
over
the
top
carbonation
i
assumed
that
this
beer
would
taste
infected
but
it
shows
no
off
flavors
or
other
signs
of
infection
it
is
a
little
on
the
dry
side
which
may
be
related
to
the
carbonation
but
otherwise
fairly
good
i
was
expecting
a
shit
beer
honestly
i
sent
one
off
to
a
friend
in
wisconsin
and
he
was
not
a
fan
of
it
maybe
it
got
better
with
aging
its
been
sitting
at
room
temp
for
about
3
months
the
very
subtle
flavors
honestly
make
it
a
great
beer
for
any
season
not
really
sure
of
what
to
expect
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
its
caramelish
toasty
chocolateycocoaish
and
a
touch
roasty
there
are
some
nice
floral
and
leafy
hops
to
it
and
it
initially
balances
quite
well
unfortunately
the
roasty
edge
builds
on
the
palate
a
bit
thus
accentuating
the
bitterness
a
bit
as
well
it
finishes
dry
with
a
coffee
character
and
solid
bitterness
the
first
quarter
of
the
glass
was
great
it
lost
luster
halfway
and
then
it
became
softer
and
more
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
the
roastiness
is
a
little
bit
much
given
the
malt
component
but
that
makes
it
unique
probably
worth
trying
took
a
chance
on
this
beer
bc
of
the
relatively
high
ba
rating
but
this
one
is
a
big
downer
pours
a
dark
somewhat
hazy
cocacola
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
pale
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
malty
aroma
has
a
smoky
overtone
and
a
hint
of
caramel
flavor
has
a
malty
core
with
smoky
caramel
and
coffee
hints
texture
has
average
powdery
body
and
just
a
little
fizz
leaving
a
malty
and
slightly
smoky
finish
given
to
me
by
the
brewerys
owner
great
guy
it
pours
a
very
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
hues
of
ruby
on
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
decent
tan
head
that
leaves
a
thin
ring
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
bread
like
quality
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
roastiness
but
also
has
hints
of
mild
chocolate
which
makes
this
a
creamy
and
very
smooth
treat
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
honey
color
to
it
though
with
some
darker
touches
around
the
sides
that
served
it
quite
well
aroma
was
decent
very
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
and
honey
notes
as
well
as
lots
of
touches
of
nuts
as
well
warming
almost
brings
out
a
touch
of
fruit
now
but
the
flavor
really
falls
off
it
seems
as
though
it
comes
across
musky
and
stale
the
fact
that
it
is
flat
does
not
help
at
all
a
wash
of
bready
malts
touches
of
grain
and
a
hint
of
caramel
all
seem
to
miss
and
this
quasi
wheat
and
fruit
note
comes
in
with
a
wet
cardboard
flavor
not
working
out
at
all
o
the
beer
is
very
sessionable
because
its
not
very
filling
goes
down
easily
and
has
a
low
alcohol
content
it
packs
in
a
lot
of
aroma
and
flavor
for
a
beer
with
a
light
body
this
is
a
nocturne
a
which
you
know
frederik
fucking
chopin
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
garnetbrown
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
dusty
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
roasted
malts
light
toffee
mineral
water
and
a
touch
of
vague
fruitiness
the
taste
holds
notes
of
very
light
roasted
malts
mild
cocoa
powder
potting
soil
dark
greens
and
a
slightly
biting
herbal
bitterness
at
the
end
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
munich
dark
something
you
dont
see
too
many
of
in

theres
a

not

an
imperial
something
or
other
and
the
components
work
well
together
the
nose
is
a
little
weird
and
doesnt
quite
reflect
the
taste

no
big

this
is
a
good
beer

fit
for

i
could
and
i
would
have
another
22
ounce
bottle
of
this
if
i
had
another
one
its
quite
tasty
for
a
dark
lager
but
it
reminds
me
more
of
an
english
brown
ale
to
me
dark
brown
color
with
a
head
that
barely
formed
before
settling
to
a
thin
film
there
was
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
pleasing
aroma
of
some
dark
malt
that
gives
hints
of
chocolate
and
smoke
i
am
not
picking
up
any
hop
aroma
good
malt
flavors
as
well
notes
of
chocolate
and
mild
roastedness
a
touch
of
grass
is
the
only
hop
flavor
i
can
detect
definate
lager
flavor
nice
body
and
carbonation
gives
this
beer
a
good
texture
this
beer
lies
somewhere
between
a
dunkel
and
a
schwarzbier
but
whatever
it
is
it
tastes
good
and
is
an
enjoyable
beer
with
a
low
abv
deep
cola
brown
color
pours
a
rich
foamy
biege
head
between
two
and
three
fingers
high
leaves
a
nice
abstract
lace
residue
around
the
glass
rich
chocolately
malty
aroma
with
taste
to
match
with
some
coffee
im
pretty
sure
thats
anise
or
licorice
i
taste
too
i
think
you
could
enjoy
this
with
a
nice
red
meat
meal
or
just
buy
itself
like
a
dessert
i
am
not
a
dark
beer
guy
but
this
was
pretty
darn
good
overall
this
wasnt
quite
robust
enough
for
a
schwarzbier
however
it
was
certainly
different
in
flavor
profile
for
an
amber
lager
a
nice
cross
between
the
two
styles
and
well
worth
a
shot
a
dark
brown
color
kind
of
chesnut
thick
tan
head
roasted
smoky
malt
aroma
some
sweetness
probably
chocolate
mostly
malt
taste
molasses
still
showed
that
smoky
taste
and
yes
there
was
a
bit
of
chocolate
taste
mediumbodied
nicely
carbonated
i
enjoyed
it
if
you
like
this
and
have
a
greater
tolerance
for
alcohol
than
i
do
then
you
can
surely
session
this
for
an
evening
this
is
a
pretty
decent
lager
d
nice
drinkability
dry
sweet
with
a
light
appreciable
smoky
touch
gives
this
some
variation
and
depth
probably
one
of
their
better
beers
to
date
and
one
that
may
finally
give
them
some
respect
drinks
like
a
smoky
vienna
lager
but
not
as
sweet
with
a
nice
dryness
for
a
finishing
touch
definitely
worth
a
try
i
like
it
would
i
ever
call
it
great
probably
not
but
that
isnt
the
point
this
is
a
great
beer
to
hang
out
with
and
session
with
it
is
like
a
comfortable
blanket
and
in
that
regard
it
succeeds
as
such
poured
into
a
pilsner
styled
glass
pour
a
clear
deep
dark
chestnut
brown
almost
black
with
a
light
tan
creamy
head
that
hangs
around
a
long
time
and
has
great
lacing
a
malty
earthy
aroma
very
malty
taste
hints
of
chocolate
but
not
too
sweet
with
a
slight
burnt
malt
and
sour
aftertaste
very
smooth
to
drink
goes
down
easy
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
cricket
hill
not
that
i
have
had
many
but
it
has
left
me
wanting
to
explore
more
of
their
brews
quite
drinkable
and
a
really
top
notch
unique
representation
of
the
style
popped
it
out
of
a
22oz
into
a
standard
pint
somewhat
denser
ebony
coloring
but
the
nose
was
a
perfect
blend
of
being
both
fruit
and
roast
the
perfect
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
cold
wintery
night
a
perfect
complement
with
a
beef
stew
or
roasted
meats
overall
started
off
thin
but
flavors
popped
as
it
warmed

good

usually
puts
out
average
brews
hopefully
a
taste
of
things
to
come
pours
deep

is
strong

a
little
dark
fruit
cherry

there
is

then
oddly
enough
be
beer

evaporates

a
decent
beer
nothing
to
get
excited
over
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
dark
lager

can
be

to
me
great
beer
to
pair
with
mexican
or
spicy
chicken
wings
o
not
a
style
that
i
have
had
a
lot
of
but
i
expected
more
roasted
malt
flavors
very
drinkable
smooth
and
clean
definitely
could
put
a
few
down
if
someone
else
made
the
purchase
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
decent
example
of
a
dunkel
but
i
tend
to
like
my
dunkel
to
have
a
more
noticeable
roasted
malt
aspects
and
with
this
beer
it
was
the
dark
fruits
that
seemed
to
stick
out
the
most
and
thats
not
really
what
im
looking
for
in
a
good
dunkel
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
a
little
crisp
and
not
filling
at
all
but
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
one
would
be
enough
for
me
but
if
i
wasnt
worried
about
taste
im
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
nice
and
it
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
it
wasnt
as
true
to
style
as
i
would
like
and
it
didnt
seem
as
balanced
as
some
of
the
better
dunkels
i
wouldnt
buy
a
bottle
of
this
again
but
i
would
for
sure
try
it
on
tap
to
see
if
its
any
different
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
as
a
good
dunkel
all
in
all
i
was
little
let
down
with
this
one
i
was
expecting
a
pretty
good
dunkel
but
this
one
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
and
so
far
its
my
least
favorite
spaten
beer
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
just
wasnt
for
me
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
beer
that
has
a
moderate
initial
foaminess
that
gradually
fades
to
a
smooth
mouthfeel
closes
dry
with
mediumlow
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
o
very
good
münchen
dunkel
o
not
as
rich
or
full
bodied
as
i
had
expected
or
hoped
for
but
a
very
easy
drinking
mildly
malty
and
curiously
slightly
fruity
brew
o
not
the
most
complex
flavors
but
totally
true
to
the
style
a
great
beer
if
you
are
after
something
darker
in
color
and
flavor
but
with
the
smooth
refreshing
simplicity
of
a
lager
a
decent
dunkel
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
easy
to
drink
o
still
and
will
always
be
my
favorite
spaten
the
others
in
the
line
up
compete
and
though
not
much
separates
them
they
fail
to
beat
the
dunkel
year
round
its
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
but
perfect
for
the
beginning
of
spring
and
mid
fall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
drank
at
oktoberfest
2010
i
also
grab
a
glass
or
two
on
the
weekend
at
the
local
bavarian
resort
near
my
house
this
is
a
smooth
dark
rich
and
semisweet
brew
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
almost
goes
down
like
water
i
am
a
big
fan
of
spaten
in
general
this
being
my
favorite
variety
they
put
out
the
purity
of
the
ingredients
lend
to
the
purity
of
the
flavor
balance
and
smooth
quality
of
this
beer
the
flavor
of
the
malt
and
hops
is
so
delicately
balanced
being
a
dark
beer
it
makes
this
one
of
the
more
unique
german
beers
that
i
have
found
the
smell
is
very
sharp
fresh
and
potent
which
matches
the
full
and
robust
flavor
upon
first
sip
these
are
easy
to
drink
indeed
but
watch
out
because
they
pack
a
whallop
of
alcohol
that
can
sneak
up
on
you
what
a
wonderful
beer
its
a
great
tasting
beer
a
dark
red
beer
taste
great
but
the
smell
its
smells
like
a
green
bottle
not
skunkie
just
a
green
bottle
smooth
tasting
dark
red
smooth
going
down
very
nice
beer
to
drink
hope
to
find
it
again
enjoy
it
o
i
know
i
mentioned
it
earlier
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
veryy
unique
flavors
reminds
me
of
some
vanilla
casket
beers
only
lighter
on
the
vanilla
and
heavier
on
the
chocolate
overall
good
but
not
great
i
expect
a
bit
more
from
the
germans
overall
tastes
like
a
beer
that
should
have
more
alcohol
i
really
wish
it
did
if
it
had
as
much
alcohol
as
spatens
optimator
7
5
id
get
a
sixer
of
this
regularly
nonetheless
a
great
tasting
brew
with
plenty
to
offer
my
first
dunkel
and
based
on
its
low
ratings
im
guessing
i
need
to
go
try
some
more
of
this
style
overall
while
at
first
i
wasnt
wild
about
the
brew
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
more
the
mix
of
the
roasted
flavors
and
the
more
fermented
grape
flavors
create
a
rather
soothing
taste
not
bad
this
is
really
enjoyable
i
dont
get
to
drink
enough
dunkel
an
this
beer
reminds
me
exactly
what
i
am
missing
out
on
rjt
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
dark
brown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
offwhite
head
there
are
lots
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
in
this
beer
there
are
aromas
of
toffee
and
roasted
malt
i
dont
get
many
hop
notes
in
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
nose
theres
some
mild
sweetness
and
the
roasted
malt
is
there
the
hops
bring
some
grassy
flavors
its
very
straightforward
and
nonoffensive
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
crisp
finish
its
very
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
o
not
what
i
would
call
a
spectacular
mindblowing
brew
but
its
quite
delicious
if
youre
in
that
dark
malty
mood
not
entirely
complex
but
satisfying
nonetheless
id
drink
it
again
but
i
cant
honestly
say
this
style
is
anything
more
than
an
occasional
treat
highly
recommended
for
early
explorers
of
craft
brew
overall
this
is
an
average
dunkel
lager
with
a
far
below
average
aroma
sheesh
bring
on
the
nail
polish
m
medium
bodied
a
bit
sticky
sweet
at
the
end
overall
solid
beer
would
pair
well
with
marinated
steak
i
think
this
beer
woud
pair
well
with
sugaree
by
jerry
garcia
o
still
love
em
my
first
love
at
old
world
in
huntington
beach
still
brings
back
memories
of
that
underaged
chicken
dance
with
a
woman
twice
my
age
and
the
flat
tire
on
the
way
home
during
oktoberfest
with
steve
like
a
first
romance
which
doesnt
result
in
a
jail
stay
ill
always
remember
spaten
as
my
first
and
the
great
times
i
had
before
i
found
all
the
other
great
things
brough
to
my
front
door
due
to
greater
trade
abilities
in
the
world
but
still
a
great
brew
bring
back
the
clubweisse
also
listed
as
a
5
2
not
the
5
5
as
on
the
site
o
a
pretty
good
dunkel
nothing
special
but
definitely
sessionable
overall
i
give
this
brew
a
4
out
of
5
the
fragrance
is
really
enjoyable
and
appealing
as
it
is
malty
and
robust
the
taste
is
complex
rich
sweet
and
dry
though
i
said
it
was
a
touch
watery
that
characteristic
improves
its
drinkability

its

well
standard
european
lager
like

in
the
taste
a
small
roast
inside
of
a
standard
european
lager
a
smooth
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
lager
like
grain
in
the
aftertaste
basically
a
standard
european
lager
with
a
note
of
like
caramel
like
roast
o
not
the
best
dunkel
you
can
drink
i
think
anyone
can
brew
a
better
example
its
a
cery
drinkable
beergood
for
a
nice
session
dunkel
taste
is
similar
sweet
with
toffee
tones
and
some
fruit
coming
in
body
is
light
and
this
is
an
easydrinking
and
enjoyable
dunkel
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brilliant
rust
color
with
1
finger
head
and
no
lace
it
becomes
whiskey
colored
as
it
warms
its

the
flavor
leads
off
with
root

and
theres
a
slight
warmth

the
beer
warms
spaten
dunkel
is
a
good

recommended
overall
definitely
a
malt
dominated
beer
the
herbal
hops
prevent
it
from
being
overly
sweet
very
drinkable

toasty
malt
caramel

some
slight
metallic

a

on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of

a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
o
very
good
brew
theyve
done
well
with
the
flavoring
everything
flows
well
together
and
finishes
with
a
crispness
leaving
you
ready
for
another
def
a
great
brew
while
watching
the
game
with
some
friends
pour
is
a
german
dunkel
the
smell
is
skunked
but
lets
see
what
i
can
do
to
get
past
the
skunk
ass
smell
is
irrelevant
in
this
review
clamped
the
nose
closed
and
plowed
through
it
its
got
those
dunkel
flavors
that
i
love
but
its
dry
almost
like
super
sugary
caramel
its
a
very
sweet
in
spite
of
the
skunk
from
the
damn
green
bottle
very
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
of
these
right
now

nothing
really

overall
a
pretty
good
easy
drinking
dunkel
an
average
brew
overall
i
good
beer
for
this
style
a
little
light
on
flavor
but
still
tasty
light
and
easy
to
drink
will
be
glad
to
sample
more
overall
not
a
great
but
not
a
terrible
experience
for
my
first
time
with
a
dunkel
an
interesting
mix
of
malt
and
light
bodied
drinkability
that
makes
it
obvious
why
this
is
a
favorite
of
fruedenfest
every
july
near
my
hometown
in
oldenburg
indiana
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
spectacular
not
my
favorite
here
pours
dark
brown
and
flat
like
the
left
over
morning
coffee
down
the
drain
with
the
dinner
dishes
smells
malty
and
astringent
taste
is
really
funny
german
malts
yes
but
in
weird
proportion
the
dark
roast
thing
doesnt
seem
to
work
here
and
the
mouthfeel
is
rough
with
so
little
carbonation
and
a
full
body
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
know
a
lot
of
these
green
glass
imports
can
be
mishandled
but
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
brew
and
i
am
a
lover
of
dunkels
overall
3
pretty
average
even
for
a
generally
unremarkable
style
light
and
drinkable
but
not
much
stands
out
except
for
the
cereal
graininess
and
a
light
caramel
very
clean
if
watery
and
thin
o
this
is
a
tasty
beer
it
is
a
rich
and
clean
tasting
dunkel
and
very
sweet
and
palatable
i
drink
a
lot
more
ales
than
lagers
and
a
good
lager
every
now
and
then
really
hits
the
spot
funny
how
you
can
realize
you
never
reviewed
what
is
a
fairly
common
beer
straight
down
the
middle
on
the
german
dark
lager
style
here
roasted
malt
flavor
is
forefront
with
a
bit
of
astringency
thinning
toward
the
end
finish
is
firm
with
a
parting
hops
note
i
cant
imagine
we
ever
get
this
beer
anything
approaching
fresh
and
particularly
for
a
lager
style
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
this
in
its
prime
gotta
love
free
bottles
right
thanks
mike
im
always
down
for
samples
this
one
pours
a
clear
sunset
ruby
topped
by
a
a
finger
of
dusty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
flaky
biscuits
light
hot
cinnamon
light
caramel
and
maybe
a
blade
of
grass
or
two
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
light
biscuit
and
what
seems
like
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
its
all
pretty
straightforward
and
ends
up
pretty
tasty
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mostly
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
dark
lager
very
drinkable
if
a
bit
on
the
dull
side
o
good
dunkel
from
spaten
haus
i
liked
it
really
got
a
lot
of
raisin
but
that
might
just
be
me
enjoyed
it
notes
pretty
simple
stuff
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
in
complexity
the
taste
feels
a
little
hollow
in
the
middle
a
little
more
toasted
caramel
than
spatens
oktoberfest
but
seemingly
not
as
well
made
will
continue
to
look
for
a
better
dunkel
hard
to
pick
a
final
review
on
this
one
its
got
some
flashes
of
brilliance
but
in
the
end
may
be
just
a
touch
too
subdued
to
be
exceptional
i
certainly
dont
regret
drinking
it
as
it
was
solid
but
it
wasnt
truly
outstanding
o
this
beer
adds
up
to
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
if
you
break
it
down
and
pick
it
apart
there
are
flaws
if
you
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
its
pretty
good
overall
very
nicely
done
its
rich
but
not
overdone
and
its
maltiness
is
superbly
balanced
by
the
spicy
hops
and
moderate
bitterness
it
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
filmy
tan
head
that
faded
quickly
i
could
smell
some
earthy
tones
along
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
maybe
even
raisins
the
taste
is
similar
with
some
dark
fruit
and
toffee
with
some
earthy
hops
coming
through
in
the
finish
feels
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
it
leaves
the
mouth
wet
this
is
a
solid
beer
nothing
amazing
but
still
good
this
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
the
smell
is
kind
of
sweet
a
little
earthy
smells
and
perhaps
some
toffee
feel
is
light
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
but
also
sort
of
light
there
is
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
not
bad
this
was
drunk
whilst
eating
sauerbraten
und
spatezel
and
the
whole
meal
finished
with
anisette
i
dont
think
that
affects
my
judgement
of
the
brew
drinkabilityoverall
i
wound
up
overall
enjoying
this
six
pack
from
spaten
one
thats
not
most
complex
but
make
very
nice
session
beer
though
slightly
sweet
the
balance
is
just
right
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
another
respectable
showing
from
a
pretty
good
brewery
mouth
was
smooth
light
with
a
short
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
coming
in
a
green
bottle
this
literally
has
0
skunk
to
it
it
tastes
like
a
fall
beer
and
can
easily
compete
with
some
top
notch
beers
spaten
is
a
top
notch
brewery
and
pretty
much
one
of
my
favorite
imports
from
germany
o
a
very
decentenjoyable
beer
would
not
mind
having
this
one
again
a
pleasant
tasty
nonagressive
sessionable
german
lager
poured
a
clear
dark
tea
brown
with
a
nice
layer
of
offwhite
head
that
retained
well
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
roasted
malts
and
pumpernickel
in
the
aroma
traces
of
caramel
and
nuts
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
mainly
rich
roasted
malts
in
the
foreground
bready
nutty
caramel
and
brown
sugar
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
quaff
for
any
occasion
i
liked
this
more
than
i
expected
probably
because
its
a
german
lager
and
not
a
crappy
american
lager
its
just
more
refined
than
the
lagers
im
used
to
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
rather
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
having
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
because
its
not
very
filling
spaten
makes
some
really
good
stuff
theyre
dunkel
is
also
quite
tasty
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
tan
foamy
head
the
head
settles
and
leaves
us
with
a
nice
roasted
nutty
aroma
with
some
pilsner
aromas
hidden
in
the
back
the
beer
tastes
good
its
got
a
nice
dry
roasted
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
drinkable
its
good
dark
german
brew
for
a
dunkel
lager
its
very
good
pours
a
brilliant
reddishmahogany
and
smells
bready
and
faintly
malty
with
delicate
touches
of
cereal
and
apricot
the
nose
is
a
little
weak
considering
the
color
and
that
weakness
continues
on
the
palate
which
feels
a
little
watered
down
a
slight
oily
maltiness
and
a
balancing
but
equally
nonstriking
hoppiness
lead
to
a
crisp
and
very
short
finish
lighter
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
drinks
very
well
was
surprised
this
was
listed
at
even

good
standard
german
version
of
the
german
style
atmosphere
is
pretty
nice
appearance
is
very
average
nose
is
a
nice
combination
of
yeast
and
sweetness
tastes
like
it
smells
yeast
and
sweet
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
its
a
dark
rich
brown
color
somewhat
coffee
hoppy
with
some
caramel
malt
flavors
caramel
notes
and
slight
floral
nots
its
really
rich
and
its
maltiness
smooths
out
its
a
good
beer
if
you
ask
me
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
its
a
medium
feel
not
too
heavy
its
a
nice
session
beer
id
drink
this
with
a
meal
d
nice
drinkability
for
its
style
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
hmm
lager
moderately
low
alcohol
content
balanced
no
offflavors
of
course
its
highly
drinkable
d
a
great
smell
and
feel
with
a
fairly
subdued
flavor
make
this
beer
i
think
rather
dangerous
i
was
done
with
mine
before
i
really
was
aware
id
finished
it
its
a
good
lager
for
session
drinking
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
examples
of
this
style
drinkability
an
acceptable
product
but
there
are
better
dunkels
from
the
old
country
than
this
pours
dark
walnut
with
a
burnished
look
and
good
clarity
but
a
somewhat
short
head
smells
surprisingly
fruity
followed
by
a
light
graininess
a
touch
of
chalky
malt
and
a
tiny
bit
of
grain
sourness
the
taste
is
even
grainier
with
more
of
that
fruitiness
and
a
somewhat
seltzerlike
finish
somewhat
pleasant
but
needs
more
depth
especially
on
the
finish
as
is
it
could
have
been
made
by
shiner
dm
smooth
drinking
sweetness
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
it
does
sit
slightly
heavy
nice
carbonation
tingle
if
youre
looking
to
try
more
than
one
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
as
the
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
i
wish
this
had
more
of
an
aroma
and
a
punch
to
it
but
sometimes
a
beer
has
to
be
unassuming
and
i
need
to
just
stop
overanalyzing
and
just
enjoy
it
if
this
is
that
beer
than
so
be
it
its
not
a
bad
choice
and
as
i
said
before
i
wish
there
were
more
to
choose
from
on
my
local
shelf
so
i
could
get
a
better
feel
for
this
style
this
beer
was
drinkable
but
borderlines
on
not
much
happening
i
kept
thinking
it
was
going
to
start
slow
and
take
off
but
no
not
bad
and
not
great
just
ok
d
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
a
little
too
mild
for
my
taste
but
would
go
well
with
almost
any
type
of
food
d
the
thin
feel
of
this
mixed
with
its
slightly
off
nose
makes
it
a
tough
one
to
enjoy
it
is
an
easy
drinking
lager
but
far
from
interesting
overall
just
an
average
beer
that
i
doubt
i
will
buy
again
if
anything
i
may
pick
up
another
bottle
in
the
future
just
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
a
bad
bottle
due
to
improper
storage
the
lightstruck
hint
in
the
nose
has
me
a
bit
concerned
that
this
bottle
was
not
truly
representative
of
this
brew
final
notes
not
impressed
you
could
do
much
better
than
this
one
and
for
gods
sake
stop
with
the
green
bottles
a
deep
redbrown
appearance
with
little
head
smelled
malty
with
a
hint
of
carmel
you
can
taste
the
malt
and
carmel
although
its
not
a
stong
taste
and
it
is
not
overly
sweet
has
a
mild
toasty
finish
this
beer
was
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
and
also
a
little
too
light
and
watery
d
this
was
quite
a
letdown
for
my
first
time
trying
the
style
pours
out
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
clear
freshness
date
medium
brown
to
dark
brown
in
color
effervescent
carbonation
and
wispy
head
smells
of
herbal
hops
up
front
with
a
roasted
malt
back
very
noticeable
taste
is
of
a
herbal
medicine
hop
up
front
again
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
in
the
back
with
a
notes
of
grass
and
grains
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
bubbly
and
has
a
balance
between
drying
and
thirst
quenching
like
a
dunkel
should
this
beer
was
made
for
drinking
and
drinking
is
what
i
do
i
will
drink
a
lot
of
these
easy
drinking
good
taste
and
refreshing
this
style
has
been
hit
on
the
head
and
then
some
great
beer
that
is
appropriate
to
this
style
to
bad
it
had
a
hit
in
the
looks
department
overall
pretty
average
for
the
style
like
a
watery
bock
beer
flavors
are
pretty
subdued
and
one
taste
mostly
malt
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
smells
like
the
taste
some
light
sweet
malts
ok
amount
of
lacing
but
retains
its
head
poorly
this
beer
is
smooth
and
light
with
a
crisp
bite
in
the
finish
pretty
good
stuff
quite
drinkable
this
is
really
nothing
special
but
is
true
to
the
style
not
an
offensive
beer
at
all
so
long
as
one
does
not
pay
too
much
for
it
this
beer
will
not
disappoint
d
overall
its
a
solid
beer
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
flavor
though
drinkability
is
good
a
very
pleasant
brew
that
i
would
buy
again
note
there
was
an
initial
skunk
smell
and
taste
in
the
very
beginning
d
very
drinkable
good
flavor
without
being
too
overbearing
sessionable
abv
d
smooth
and
dry
beer
i
would
like
to
have
a
cople
of
these
decent
but
not
high
doubt
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
a
sixer
but
would
definitely
try
again
be
interested
to
try
it
on
draft
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
some
malty
sweetness
up
front
and
leaves
a
slightly
dry
finish
on
the
back
there
is
no
aftertaste
and
its
a
good
dunkel
lager
overall
its
a
little
like
a
bock
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
order
it
again
pours
a
cola
colored
shade
of
brown
with
decent
head
at
first
that
recedes
to
little
after
awhile
nose
is
light
with
some
caramel
and
malt
on
the
palate
the
malt
sweetness
comes
across
with
a
toasty
quality
finish
is
light
in
flavor
with
a
lingering
toasty
malt
flavor
drinkability
maybe
when
paired
with
the
right
meal
i
would
enjoy
this
more
but
by
itself
im
getting
tired
of
it
about
halfway
through
the
glass
it
didnt
go
well
with
baked
pasta
tomato
base
and
mozzarella
so
maybe
thats
whats
throwing
me
off
but
the
fact
that
there
is
no
date
on
the
bottle
could
mean
the
beer
is
old
with
the
dark
color
i
was
expecting
a
heaver
body
and
deeper
taste
but
was
disappointed
and
feel
that
this
is
just
a
pilsner
with
food
coloring
and
cinnamon
it
has
that
sourness
of
the
original
spaten
but
toned
down
with
a
bit
more
focus
on
malts
but
not
much
more
it
burns
a
bit
going
down
and
i
wasnt
too
motivated
to
finish
the
bottle
malty
nutty
flavor
more
dry
than
sweet
though
there
is
a
hint
lingering
notes
of
cereal
grain
simple
but
with
a
bit
of
toastiness
that
gives
it
the
signature
dunkel
character
well
carbonated
and
somewhat
effervescent
suitable
for
drinking
by
the
liter
prost
pours
chocolate
colour
body
with
some
mocha
head
from
half
time
maltish
aroma
a
modest
roastiness
average
mouthfeel
very
good
drinkability
though
somewhat
sweet
a
tad
yeasty
finishes
a
little
drying
another
decent
inbev
beer
i
would
have
this
again
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
d
good
drinkability
this
dunkel
is
a
fair
beer
the
aroma
offers
up
much
more
than
the
flavor
does
in
terms
of
potency
but
its
still
a
nice
brew
for
the
style
very
good
dunkel
overall
exactly
what
it
should
be
a
bit
more
complex
and
toasty
than
a
helles
with
the
same
drinkability
i
really
want
to
try
this
on
tap
with
some
german
food
cheers
d
ok
dunkel
but
not
one
pf
the
best
or
one
i
would
recommend
d
highly
quaffable
id
love
to
sit
back
and
drink
a
sixer
of
this
brew
i
loved
its
mild
nutty
flavor
profile
that
demands
you
to
take
sip
after
sip
mouthfeel
is
very
good
as
well
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
co2
i
really
recommend
this
beer
id
definitely
like
to
pick
this
one
up
sometime
cheers
d
highly
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
i
prefer
a
different
hop
flavor
and
i
almost
want
to
say
its
slightly
skunked
but
cant
be
sure
decent
beer
value
6
99
for
a
sixer
cannot
complain
do
i
could
have
this
one
again
in
a
heart
beat
d
yes
more
please
in
fact
its
been
a
while
so
i
will
need
another
pour
glad
its
now
available
in
the
variety
case
drinkability
is
fine
i
could
easily
drink
5
or
6
of
these
no
problem
very
decent
and
interesting
beer
cheers
d
a
decent
lager
some
nice
caramel
malts
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
try
again
but
probably
not
seek
out
middle
of
the
road
dunkel
that
loses
a
bit
of
steam
in
my
book
for
being
overly
sweet
for
style
especially
in
the
finish
a
little
bit
more
carbonation
might
make
this
beer
a
bit
crisper
more
drinkable
who
knows
hofbrau
dunkel
also
comes
in
the
green
bottle
but
ive
always
gotten
it
fresh
now
that
is
how
you
do
dunkel
this
one
is
sorta
like
meh
but
good
d
not
a
bad
quaff
can
sit
around
with
friends
and
have
several
of
these
not
a
chimay
but
not
bad
either
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
light
this
is
good
dunkel
nothing
special
edit
revisited
this
today
on
this
second
record
breaking
day
of
east
coast
heat
530pm
and
its
still
100
degrees
so
this
being
a
very
cold
brew
hits
the
spot
and
some
of
the
above
criticisms
work
to
be
highlights
now
glad
it
isnt
thick
and
overbearing
and
subtle
very
refreshing
actually
the
flavor
profile
is
much
more
pronounced
than
the
day
i
tried
it
first
in
april
my
tongue
seems
to
change
with
the
seasons
so
i
bumped
up
a
few
points
to
balance
these
two
samplings
drinkability
this
beer
offers
some
the
flavors
of
heavier
beers
in
a
lighter
bodied
package
that
is
not
gimmicky
lite
or
watery
d
drinkable
i
still
like
other
brews
by
spaten
and
will
likely
not
buy
again
simply
because
i
can
find
other
brews
that
i
like
better
split
a
pitcher
at
j
ryans
in
syracuse
the
pitcher
made
this
beer
look
like
a
porter
but
in
a
smaller
glass
is
became
clear
brown
i
have
to
say
this
brew
reminds
me
a
lot
of
spatens
optimator
i
guess
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
they
shared
the
same
yeast
and
similar
grains
anyways
that
meant
this
dunkel
had
a
big
dark
breadcrust
flavor
with
mild
licorice
around
the
edges
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
flavor
upfront
but
spaten
is
a
more
corporatetasting
read
simple
brand
not
a
bad
dunkel
for
a
session
d
its
drinkable
not
my
favorite
spaten
product
but
certainly
not
horrible
d
this
is
an
okay
munich

the
aroma
was
disappointing
but
the
flavor
was
good

a

color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
poor
retention
and
poor

smells
of
sweet

yeast
pale
malt
and
sulfur
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
dunkel
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
yeast
sulfur
and
a
hint
of
pale
hops
overall
the
sulfur
is
dominate
but
other
flavors
account
for
a
decent
munich
overall
this
beer
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
medium
bodied
fairly
smooth
and
very
drinkable
d
super
easy
to
drink
for
sure
a
decent
beer
overall
fairly
easy
to
drink
id
probably
have
it
again
soft
malts
on
the
palate
with
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
and
a
nice
chocolaty
fade
into
a
long
finish
mellow
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
though
not
watery
definately
a
solid
beer
i
expect
spaten
products
to
be
pretty
good

mouthfeel
is
the
only
thing
that
slips
a
little
in
my
book
it
tends
to
be
a
little
tart
and
not
really
a
full
bodied
beer
as
the
style
should
be
the
carbonation
is
also
a
tad
aggressive
which
sizzles
a
little
much
and
distracts
from
the
fine
malt
profile
it
is
however
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
one
ive
been
happy
to
wrap
my

around

this
is
the
best

block
beer
ive
had
the
only
one
that
the
body
wasnt
light
to
the
point
of
distraction
its
not
a
great
beer
but
its
plenty
tolerable
atwater
more
such
essays
please
poured
a
bottle
of
this
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
nice
deep
brown
that
was
clear
the
head
was
a
light
tan
color
the
aromas
were
roasted
malts
some
nuts
and
sugars
there
wasnt
much
of
a
hops
aroma
the
taste
was
slightly
bitter
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
dark
beer
this
brew
was
just
a
decent
one
for
me
i
can
live
without
having
this
one
again
but
it
might
be
worth
a
try
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
also
a
good

of
the

pretty

off

edit2
shortly
after
reviewing
this
beer
i
contacted
the
brewery
to
tell
them
about
my
infected
six
pack
they
responded
the
next
day
they
apologized
and
told
me
it
was
and
old
batch
and
that
they
would
be
happy
to
contact
my
distributor
and
get
me
a
replacement
three
weeks
later
i
got
an
email
from
my
local
distributor
telling
me
that
they
had
dropped
my
beer
of
at
local
store
i
went
to
pick
it
up
and
found
they
had
given
me
two
six
packs
instead
of
the
one
replacement
i
think
it
was
very
nice
of
atwater
to
do
this
it
shows
that
they
really
do
care
about
their
customers
this
batch
was
spot
on
and
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
i
have
updated
the
rating
to
reflect
this
thanks
atwater
from
making
a
great
dunkel
and
for
taking
care
of
your
customers
the
draft
version
was
about
the
same
as
the
bottle
but
may
have
been
more
enjoyable
on
draft
as
it
had
a
nice
dark
color
and
flavor
profile
while
being
a
light
drinker
in
alcohol
making
it
sessionable
bottle
sample

of
my
friend
nick
a

cola

with
a
frothed
beige

medium

nasty
cabbage
aftertaste
unfortunately
a
drainpour
drinks
very
smooth
sessionable
with
the
best
munich
dunkels
overall
this
beer
had
a
decent
nose
but
lack
in
the
taste
department
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
astringent
this
one
has
a
significant
yuckyum
factor
the
aroma
is
alright
its
light
but
mildly
chocolaty
with
cream
soda
brown
sugar
tea
and
dark
malts
the
appearance
is
brown
with
a
medium
sized
head
the
flavor
is
where
this
one
starts
to
have
problems
you
first
get
a
bad
fruitiness
that
is
like
over
ripe
watermelon
and
basil
then
a
nice
chocolaty
dark
malt
flavor
follows
finally
there
is
an
astringent
bitter
aftertaste
the
palate
is
thin
this
one
has
major
problems
with
off
flavors
but
there
is
potential
bottle
a
dark
brown
pour
with
way
too
much
headfoam
all
over
aroma
of
dark
bread
and
burnt
plastic
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
malt
like
burnt
carameltea
and
something
else
sorry
this
was
not
for
me
i
will
try
this
again
if
i
get
the
chance
to
see
if
maybe
the
sample
was
just
bad
if
you
took
out
the
taste
the
body
was
a
good
coonsistency
and
carbonation
i
will
try
this
again
at
the
mi
beer
fest
this
weekend
and
see
if
it
was
a
bad
batch
drinkability
is
average
due
mostly
to
the
carbonation
i
had
great
hopes
for
this
brew
and
was
completely
let
down
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
as
with
the
pils
from
atwater
this
is
another
case
study
in
quality
control
it
is
overcarbonated
to
the
nth
degree
and
that
smelly
little
kid
is
still
waddling
around
with
his
waterwings
on
or
a
fat
lazy
guy
at
the
public
pool
sitting
on
a
raft
with
his
head
and
the
zenith
of
his
belly
just
above
waterthe
raft
sunken
under
water
by
his
weight
but
still
having
enough
buoyancy
to
keep
his
head
and
hairy
navel
above
the
water
for
all
the
world
to
seethe
point
is
this
plasticy
aromaband
aids
and
as
with
the
pils
it
also
finishes
quite
dry
im
on
the
sidelines
as
to
whether
id
buy
this
again
i
might
at
a
much
later
date
just
to
see
if
i
was
just
having
bad
luck
with
the
batches
and
carbonation
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
decent
dunkel
higher
but
somewhat
dull
carbonation
as
i
said
it
seemed
highly
carbonated
when
poured
but
there
isnt
much
as
far
as
bubbly
brightness
somewhat
matted
and
slick
just
a
hint
of
dry
warmth
is
noticeable
in
the
finish
i
enjoyed
this
one
with
pork
and
sauerkraut
on
new
years
day
and
it
paired
reasonably
well
but
not
a
great
drinker
on
its
own
in
my
opinion
somewhat
lacking
overall
beautiful
appearance
nice
and
dark
like
weak
coffee
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
heavy
sweet
carmel
and
coffee
aroma
maybe
a
touch
of
smoke
as
well
tastes
great
sweet
coffee
and
carmel
and
toffee
kind
of
taste
with
roasted
malt
and
a
general
pleasant
sweetness
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
the
hometown
detroit
atwater
brewery
did
a
hell
of
a
job
brewing
it
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
nice
and
chewy
and
easy
to
drink
i
have
more
that
i
could
say
about
this
beer
but
the
babys
crying
i
highly
recommend
it
and
the
abv
is
5
2
by
the
way
the
smell
and
appearance
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
the
taste
will
make
you
smile
the
second
it
hits
your
lips
the
drinkability
was
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
prosit
mk
drinkability
out
of
six
different
atwater
brews
this
one
was
by
far
the
best
of
the
bunch
but
still
just
wasnt
worth
it
medium
grainy
with
a
mouthfull
of
eurohops
on
the
finish
with
lingering
dryness
overall
full
to
the
style
taste
is
very
much
like
the
aroma
but
multiplied
big
dark
bread
grainy
malts
with
a
caramel
toffee
sweetness
again
milk
chocolate
is
there
and
dominates
the
mid
palate
with
a
sliced
vanilla
bean
hint
a
bit
roasty
on
the
finish
but
not
too
much
so
very
simple
yet
flavorful
beer
nice
carbonation
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel

to
session
light
mouthfeelsome
grainynesswith
a
slight
bit
of
cloying
not
a
bad

beerslightly
on
the
bland
side
not
a

i
would
want
to
drink
a

of
appearance
a

brown

tone
with
a
large
tan
beige

forms
large
bands
of

as
it

and
between

mild

with
a

and
a

dark

in

mouthfeel
is
light
to

with
a
healthy
amount

carbonation
that
almost
gets
in
the
way
of
drinkabiilty
terrible
compared
to
the
velvet
quality
of
penn
dark
drinkability
is
okay
not
a
dunkel
i
would
reach
for
again
in
the
future
i
have
a
general
issue
with
atwater
beers
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
reason
why
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
drinking
more
detroit
beers
this
is
the
first
time
ive
seen
this
brewerys
beers
for
sale
here
in
oklahoma
city
pours
with
a
thick
2finger
head
it
is
very
dark
but
you
can
see
through
it
there
is
a
slight
bready
smell
as
it
is
poured
the
taste
is
all
malt
but
not
sweet
very
little
hop
presence
it
seems
to
dry
out
the
tongue
doesnt
leave
lots
behind
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
but
not
thick
feeling
i
am
just
beginning
to
explore
the
traditional
germantype
lagers
so
i
dont
know
if
this
is
representative
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
but
i
am
not
sure
i
will
purchase
again
overall
a
good
solid
beer
not
too
extreme
but
it
doesnt
fade
into
the
background
easily
overall
an
interesting
soursweet
flavor
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
all
in
all
a
mostly
unremarkable
brew
worth
a
try
pretty
brownishreddish
body
with
a
white
head
that
falls
pretty
fast
to
a
ring
the
bottem
of
my
flute
is
a
lighter
color
then
the
top
of
the
flute
smell
is
some
fruit
and
carmel
the
taste
isnt
bad
at
allit
has
some
carmel
notes
and
fruity
notes
as
well
i
see
what
people
say
about
the
carbonationit
is
a
bit
overly
carbonatedlike
soda
very
clean
after
tastethere
is
no
lacing
on
my
glass
at
all
i
dont
really
know
if
i
taste
the
hops
in
here
the
mouthful
is
sweet
and
pleasent
and
on
the
light
side
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
seems
to
water
down
in
my
opinion
but
it
still
has
that
steller
smell
i
liked
itim
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
good
job
to
atwater
brewery
found
myself
impressed
with
this
brew
after
being
a
bit
disapointed
with
a
few
other
atwater
block
brews
i
really
felt
that
this
one
fit
the
style
well
the
color
was
a
colalike
brown
mohogany
with
timid
staying
power
with
carbonation
and
head
retention
the
aromas
are
a
lightly
toasted
maltiness
with
moderate
sweetness
hop
balance
and
breadiness
a
pretty
basic
flavor
profile
but
with
ideal
balance
the
texture
was
quite
smooth
and
modestly
rich
although
watered
late
the
brew
found
to
be
characterful
flavorful
and
hightly
drinkable
with
very
faint
flaws
but
because
of
its
timid
nature
difficult
to
applaude
as
well
pours
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
deep
mahogany
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
sour
nose
starts
like
a
lambic
tart
fruity
nothing
like
a
dunkel
hints
of
malt
in
the
background
1
69
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
ia
i
would
order
another
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
this
is
my
first
review
though
ive
been
drinking
quality
beer
for
years
overall
it
started
off
a
little
weak
and
kind
of
grew
on
me
the
color
seemed
pretty
typical
for
a
german
dark
and
the
smell
was
ok
taste
improved
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
beer
which
i
poured
into
a
glass
beer
stein
mouthfeel
which
is
definitely
something
i
dont
analyze
much
yet
seemed
a
little
more
champagnelike
than
a
beer
should
be
its
drinkable
though
and
the
flavor
picks
up
the
more
you
drink
leaving
you
considering
having
more
slightly
on
the
flat
side
but
the
texture
otherwise
is
very
pleasant
and
frankly
im
enjoying
this
enough
that
id
gladly
have
a
few
good
poured
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
hin
of
a
creamy
head
which
turned
into
a
light
lace
around
the
rim
smells
of
malt
caramel
and
astringent
fruit
tastes
like
a
fruity
wine
slight
bitterness
but
an
overwhelming
sour
fruit
grapes
slight
sourness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
this
resembles
a
red
wine
too
much
without
the
dryness
would
be
a
very
nice
beer
but
the
contamination
takes
away
from
the
experience
atwater
dunkel
pours
a
dark
brown
body
beneath
a
cremy
head
of
tan
that
drops
steadily
to
an
average
collar
lacing
is
limited
to
a
few
spots
and
splashes
here
and
there
the
nose
expresses
a
gentle
carameledged
maltiness
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
perhaps
slightly
elevated
carbonation
given
the
style
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
as
the
nose
indicates
with
mild
darkcaramel
and
subtle
roastiness
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
it
finishes
dry
and
acidic
from
the
dark
malts
a
fairly
average
dunkel
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
i
have
had
atwater
before
and
there
lagers
are
great
i
have
had
this
before
i
reviewed
this
beer
and
i
will
try
it
again
and
rereview
it
but
i
hate
getting
a
sour
beer
it
not
to
sour
but
i
am
dumping
this
brew
plays
taps
im
also
going
to
write
the
brewery
and
complain
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
fine
fluffy
tanwhite
head
nose
is
of
sweet
toasted
malts
quite
pleasant
as
it
warms
taste
initially
was
very
malty
with
a
dry
hop
finish
the
sweet
malts
and
the
lager
style
are
becoming
more
prevelant
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
become
smoother
and
creamier
as
i
progress
through
this
brew
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
poured
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
very
creamy
tannish
head
left
profuse
lacing
as
the
head
fell
same
is
dominated
by
rich
dark
molasses
with
a
slight
roasted
note
also
found
taste
is
very
sweet
mainly
of
dark
fruit
moderated
a
a
distinct
hop
bitterness
finsh
is
more
dry
than
sweet
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
great
one
is
enough
di
liked
it
the
other
two
i
received
will
be
enjoyed
to
the
fullest
d
eh
not
that
impressive
not
bad
but
not
great
i
recieved
this
in
my
beer
of
the
month
club
shipment
for
the
month
of
may
and
finally
had
the
chance
to
taste
it
it
is
a
good
tasting
beer
that
is
sort
of
malty
it
is
not
hoppy
at
all
i
enjoyed
the
tan
head
on
the
beer
it
was
a
little
on
the
thick
side
but
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
if
needed
verdict
i
am
not
impressed
atwater
dunkel
is
onedimensional
and
a
weak
dimension
at
that
overall
impression
very
enjoyable
dark
and
brooding
but
balanced
enough
not
to
fatigue
the
palate
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
slightly
roasted
malt
aroma
its
dry
and
a
bit
fruity
from
the
yeast
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
sour
crystal
malt
flavor
its
sweet
but
the
dryness
ruins
the
overall
taste
it
also
has
a
sharp
roasted
character
the
mouthfeel
is
average
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
forgettable
black
lager
looks
pretty
nice
apearing
very
deep
brown
almost
black
yet
yielding
easily
to
light
fairly
nice
offwhite
head
as
well
the
smell
is
mainly
lager
yeast
with
a
bit
of
black
malt
in
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
hops
are
virtualy
undetectable
there
is
a
bit
of
depth
to
the
malt
profile
and
there
are
some
yeasty
flavors
as
well
i
am
detecting
a
hint
of
a
soursulphur
aftertaste
its
gotta
be
either
the
yeast
or
the
water
ive
gotta
say
that
is
a
pretty
sizable
flaw
the
feel
is
bubbly
but
also
slightly
sticky
i
really
wish
i
liked
this
beer
more
there
was
much
i
liked
about
this
beer
but
it
had
a
slight
tartness
that
detracted
from
my
overall
enjoyment
quite
dark
with
gorgeous
dark
ruby
highlights
thin
very
light
tan
head
that
thins
quickly
to
a
collar
but
produces
some
lacing
hops
jump
out
in
the
aroma
a
bit
floral
and
spicy
roast
malts
and
brown
sugar
lie
underneath
some
cocoa
and
roast
in
the
flavour
to
start
things
followed
by
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
burnt
character
really
comes
through
it
finishes
with
lingering
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
thats
a
little
harsh
and
not
helped
by
astringency
from
the
grain
light
body
and
dry
but
still
has
a
bit
of
syrupy
texture
fairly
unbalanced
with
some
harshness
that
i
didnt
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
crisp
and
sweetly
refreshing
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
thouroghly
enjoyed
this
slàinte
not
bad
poured
out
to
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
nice
head
and
some
lace
around
the
glass
medium
low
carbonation
odors
of
grain
and
light
smoke
were
noted
somewhat
of
a
roasted
character
flavor
was
pretty
good
but
slightly
bland
notes
of
malt
and
cooked
corn
were
present
along
with
a
burnt
sugar
quality
mildly
creamy
mouthfeel
went
down
easy
id
drink
this
again
medium
to
light
mouth
that
is
interupted
by
the
sharp
carbonation
not
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
from
ordering
something
else
for
the
next
round
this
beer
departs
the
bottle
a
nice
ambered
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
very
roasty
almost
like
very
deeply
roasted
nuts
and
lots
of
lagery
goodness
to
boot
the
flavor
is
very
roasty
much
better
than
some
of
the
other
dark
lagers
ive
had
recently
i
like
it
almost
a
burnt
character
on
the
malt
the
feel
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
just
a
bit
lighter
than
a
medium
feel
overall
its
nice
and
smooth
the
flavor
is
good
and
everything
comes
together
well
i
like
it
deep
bister
with
a
trace
haze
tall
dense
pitted
light
beige
head
leaves
lace
hints
of
bitter
cocoa
and
smoky
black
malt
in
aroma
toasted
malt
and
dilute
nut
hints
surface
as
the
beer
warms
prosaic
aromawise
in
flavor
prevalent
in
malt
character
is
acidic
roasted

a
good
yet
uninspiring
offering
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
a
decent
fluffy
top
aromas
are
a
bit
overworked
with
deep
roasted
aromas
that
border
scorched
mostly
caramel
malt
some
nutiness
in
aroma
and
flavor
yet
roasted
to
the
point
of
becoming
somewhat
burnt
tasting
the
beer
seems
to
be
just
a
tad
over
the
top
yet
not
in
a
balanced
sort
of
way
id
like
a
tad
less
blackness
and
a
bit
more
restraint
and
a
little
more
in
the
refreshing
category
but
thats
just
me
a
solid
but
somewhat
uninspired
offering
from
the
folks
by
the
river
deep
dark
brew
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
looks
quite
good
little
to
no
aroma
except
for
hints
of
big
burly
roasted
malts
a
little
chocolate
in
the
background
flavor
is
completely
dominated
by
the
roasties
pretty
onedimension
though
not
at
all
unpleasant
just
pretty
average
pint
went
down
pretty
easy
this
is
a
darker
lager
and
a
style
i
admire
with
a
body
that
is
a
tad
beyond
dark
ambercopper
and
more
toward
bronze
it
is
full
bodied
almost
to
a
fault
and
creates
a
feel
a
bit
toward
syrupy
the
drinkability
is
affected
by
this
dragging
down
a
fairly
sweet
taste
that
seemed
reasonably
well
controlled
and
balanced
a
decent
look
and
aroma
make
this
a
desirable
beer
but
not
a
top
beer
oa
good
beer
just
wanted
to
update
my
rating
taste
all
very
similar
seemingly
flat
out
of
the
sheet
beer
glass
tinge
of
bitter
aftertaste
poured
a
really
dark
brown
body
with
reddish
highlights
along
with
a
frothy
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malt
tastes
almost
exclusively
of
roasted
malt
and
not
much
else
pretty
boring
honestly
and
feels
kinda
watery
overall
it
was
fairly
disappointing
kind
of
surprising
considering
i
have
loved
every
other
beer
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
and
i
typically
love
dark
beers
like
black
lagers
stouts
and
porters
it
was
ok
just
ok
had
a
little
chocolate
taste
to
it
but
a
strange
overall
flavor
overall
just
meh
not
a
bad
beer
seems
like
its
not
as
aggressive
as
it
looks
id
have
another
i
felt
this
beer
was
oddly
harsh
o
its
alright
franconia
started
in
a
town
about
15
miles
from
where
i
grew
up
and
now
they
brew
fulltime
about
20
miles
from
my
current
home
considering
that
its
available
at
just
about
any
establishment
with
a
decent
selection
near
me
its
well
above
the
average
fare
but
not
quite
good
enough
that
id
seek
it
out
in
particular
overall
im
not
sure
how
to
rate
this
is
this
a
german
coffee
stout
or
what
call
it
that
and
i
say
i
love
it
its
not
as
thick
and
creamy
as
say
a
mikkeler
black
or
their
others
coffee
stouts
so
itd
be
missing
that
for
a
great
coffee
stout
so
its
not
a
stout
but
a
coffeedunkel
lager
that
would
be
a
great
beer
that
id
pay
for
and
in
fact
rate
it
a
4
3
of
5
but
an
authenitic
dunkel
a
2
of
5
again
i
like
this
beer
its
just
shitty
marketing
to
gullible
texans
i
dont
like
strange
eh
im
really
torn
here
i
need
yalls
opinion
here
this
isnt
a
beer
i
buy
in
bottle
form
for
home
drinking
but
its
definitely
one
that
if
its
available
makes
a
great
companion
to
a
variety
of
lunch
and
dinner
meals
not
just
trad
german
it
goes
great
with
highly
spicy
thai
or
indian
this
dunkel
brew
is
an
acceptable
example
of
the
style
but
notice
how
many
times
i
used
the
word
light
in
my
descriptions
that
is
probably
the
main
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
the
thin
body
and
light
character
make
it
seem
like
a
beer
with
potential
that
hasnt
been
met
i
did
notice
that
the
character
is
better
if
you
pour
two
thirds
of
the
bottle
into
a
glass
swirl
the
remainder
and
then
quickly
dump
it
into
the
same
glass
but
the
lightness
still
remains
and
that
may
be
enough
to
ruin
the
tasting
for
some
it
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
may
not
have
enough
body
and
flavor
to
satisfy
the
harshest
critics
among
us
solid
beer
easy
drinking
id
get
it
again
overall
id
have
another
for
a
fairly
new
brewery
not
a
bad
beer
presentation
packaged
in
a
plain
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown

in
a
new

summary
was
looking
forward
to
this
brew
since
the
brewery
is
in
tx
and
im
always
looking
for
good
local
stuff
unfortunately
this
ones
not
real
memorable
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
just
average
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
someone
offered
warsteiner
and
spaten
make
better
dunkels
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark

tight
foamy

and
lots
of
lacing
nose
is
oaky
chocolaty
and
roasty
oaky
malt
with
some
licorice
and
grass
components
bitter
and
earthy
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
had
the
franconia
dunkel
on
tap
at
the
local
whole
foods
this
is
the
first
franconia
beer
that
i
have
tasted
and
i
must
admit
that
i
was
impressed
it
was
very
smooth
with
lots
of
malty
sweetness
and
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
that
was
pleasant
and
not
overpowering
one
of
the
better
dunkels
that
i
have
had
o
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
not
as
heavy
as
some
beers
in
this
style
nice
flavors
and
a
wonderful
appearance
would
pair
very
nicely
with
texas
bbq

a
very
dark

followed
by
a

decent

overall
an
excellent
dunkel
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
its
my
2nd
favorite
beer
at
this
brewery
the

a

of

darker

with
a

also
coming
through
the

stumbled
upon
this
rare
find
in
the
highland
park
area
of
dallas
ordered
a
pint
immediately
and
was
very
pleased
with
all
aspects
of
this
local
brew
half
inch
foamy
head
and
dark
brown
almost
a
stout
in
color
smell
was
of
fresh
roasted
coffee
and
molasses
which
was
perfect
on
a
cold
day
taste
was
great
but
reminded
me
of
a
coffee
porter
which
was
fine
with
me
but
forces
my
score
down
as
it
is
not
accurate
to
the
style
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
excellent
which
is
why
i
ordered
a
second
pint
with
excitement
highly
recommend
my
first
sample
from
this
brewery
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
perfect
for
the
style
tried
this
and
a
lager
after
the
franconia
brewery
tour
drink
the
nearly
toolight
mouthfeel
is
redeemed
by
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
flavorful
and
complex
enough
to
appreciate
slowly
but
light
and
refreshing
enough
to
quench
your
thirst
a
uniquely
special
beer
chocolate
notes
carry
through
to
the
flavor
along
with
a
definite
grain
sweetness
more
so
than
perhaps
any
dunkel
i
have
had
decent
amount
of
roast
and
the
hops
are
very
tame
to
say
the
least
nice
and
fresh
tasting
brew
a
bit
more
robust
than
many
of
the
style
plenty
of
flavor
body
is
certainly
not
thin
this
is
solid
theres
some
good

brews
coming

guy

hes
doing

beer
this
beer
is
full

and
ready
to
rumble
dunkel
is
borderline
chewy
and
extremely
satisfying
at
the
pub
they
told
me
it
was
seasonal
which
made
me
a
little
misty
eyed
i
could
drink
it
year
round
this
brewery
gets
not
enough

dry
for
the
beer
dweebs
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
just
an
average
beer
no
real
character
nothing
more
to
say
d
there
were
some
little
things
going
on
with
this
beer
that
didnt
get
me
excited
the
flavor
is
a
little
bland
and
the
body
was
pretty

pretty

fairly
clean
soft

palate
easy
on
the
tongue
and
interesting
enough
to
ponder
it
is
fairly
true
to
the
bjcp
munich
dunkel
style
guidelines
but
more
importantly
i
like
it
and
would
definitely
try
another
franconia
brew
solidly
good
overall
a
easying
drinking
but
moderately
flavored
lager
o
this
beer
is
really
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
and
one
i
would
enjoy
having
again
a
really
nice
dunkel
overall
the
pilsner
qualities
of
the
beer
are
clear
while
the
additions
of
dark
grain
add
numerous
complexities
for
extra
robust
taste
and
texture
a
very
good
german
dunkel
a
good
well
made
beer
with
nothing
really
bad
about
it
aroma
is
deep
and
dark

the
start

are
all
over

vanilla
hints
of

roasted
nuts
some

sugar
dark
frits
figs
maybe
really
just
complex
as
i
even
pull
a
touch
of
vanilla
through
after
a
few
minutes
really
nice
and
quite
full
feel
for
the
style
due
in
most
part
to
near
perfect
carbonation
this
allows
the
flavor
to
roll
across
the
palate
and
really
just
cling
to
every
ounce
of
taste
buds
you
have
caramel
bready
notes
hints
of
light
spice
are
all
leading
the
charge
here
dvery
drinakble
just
like
a
nice

d
im
not
so
sure
that
this
one
shines
as
a

very
solid
drinkable
lager
perfect
option
if
you
are
sick
of
the
other
lager
but
i
have
to
hope
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
this
just
seems
completely
mediocre
juliandec

this
was
decent
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
cans
of
this
on
hand
in
those
situations
where
bottled
beer
is
not
an
option
kendoapr
13
but
not
too
inyourface
id
pick
it
up
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
also
a
bonus
that
it
comes
in
a
can
i
hope
other
breweries
besides
sly
fox
easy
drinking
actually
really
good
interesting
choice
to
make
a
pumpkin
lager
rather
then
a
ale
good
job
duclaw
not
my
wifes
favorite
but
a
nice
choice
overall
with
a
decent
pumpkin
spice
flavor
had
two
pints
at
dinner
with
braised
short
ribs
in
philadelphia
not
a
spicy
as
i
anticipated
didnt
get
too
much
from
the
nose
very
tasty
and
drinkable
i
think
its
a
nice
fall
selection
beer
on
tap
i
recommend
it
its
not
very
hoppy
and
can
be
a
session
beer
in
a
safe
environment
of
course
the
taste
is
very
good
with
nice
spice
flavor
up
front
with
light
spice
flavor
up
front
with
fruity
element
and
caramel
in
the
malt
with
dry
cinnamonlike
woody
element
in
the
spicy
dry
finish
this
is
a
pretty
good
dark
lager
with
some
spice
flavor
very
crisp
character
with
good
blend
of
malt
and
spice
flavor
o
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
lager
i
notice
that
im
guing
rather
than
sipping
i
need
to
buy
a
few
more
of
these
nutmeg
and
good
o
not
my
kind
of
pumpkin
beer
just
like
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
a
lager
overall
this
is
a
rather
nice
pumpkin
brew
with
a
good
roasted
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
spice
overall
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
one
had
a
good
bit
of
inherent
carbonation
so
i
could
not
pour
it
as
quickly
as
i
would
like
but
i
still
got
a
pseudocascade
resulting
in
three
fingers
of
foamy
tawny
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
srm
13
17
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
the
characteristic
pumpkin
spice
smell
of
at
least
cinnamon
and
allspice
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
spiciness
was
immediately
evident
on
the
tongue
especially
cinnamon
strangely
enough
the
taste
put
me
more
in
mind
of
apple
pie
i
dont
mean
this
as
good
or
bad
just
different
actually
given
the
plethora
of
pumpkin
beers
that
i
ran
through
last
year
this
would
make
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
especially
since
it
has
a
lager
as
its
base
the
spices
made
the
finish
fairly
dry
but
pleasantly
so
not
gasping
i
would
put
this
one
forth
as
an
alternative
to
all
of
the
pumpkin
ales
if
nothing
else
o
overall
i
think
this
a
great
fall
time
beer
i
usually
am
not
a
big
pumpkin
fan
with
beer
but
this
one
is
the
perfect
pumpkin
beer
for
me
it
is
not
overwhelming
and
still
has
that
nice
beer
taste
as
opposed
to
a
strong
pumpkin
pie
taste
o
its
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
for
me
nothing
that
blows
my
socks
off
but
it
has
a
good
flavor
and
is
easy
to
drink
kind
of
a
winding
down
the
season
beer
after
tasting
at
least
half
a
dozen
pumpkin
and
fall
beers
it
fits
just
right
for
a
tired
palate
overall
damn
this
is
a
good
beer
no
this
is
a
great
beer
i
love
how
complex
the
flavor
profile
it
is
how
nicely
balanced
between
malt
and
spice
and
hops
it
is
im
always
going
to
have
some
of
this
on
hand
this
beer
has
a
dark
rich
mahogany
color
body
with
very
little
head
the
smell
has
a
light
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
some
some
malt
the
taste
is
not
over
powering
of
any
spice
just
very
well
balanced
between
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
it
also
has
a
nice
malt
back
bone
to
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
overall
it
is
good
but
not
great
i
didnt
get
any
pumpkin
from
it
o
flat
out
disgusting
i
cant
see
this
being
good
in
winter
or
any
other
time
i
wouldnt
let
an
unwelcomed
guest
drink
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
anything
wrong
with
the
beer
besides
the
fact
that
it
isnt
all
that
interesting
kind
of
has
this
clogged
flavor
profile
thing
going
on
decent
but
too
thick
i
guess
this
isnt
filtered
pretty
good
but
thicker
than
youd
usually
get
for
the
style
o
pretty
good
fallwinter
beer
almost
like
a
pumpkin
spice
lager
without
the
pumpkin
if
that
makes
sense
overall
nothing
to
seek
out
again
but
it
was
a
good
offering
from
these
guys
was
in
a
maryland
beer
shop
decide
to
try
another
one
of
her
native
brews
been
a
good
while
since
i
had
a
dunkel
nice
deep
amber
color
wonderful
spicy
aroma
of
cloves
and
i
want
to
say
allspice
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
not
to
complex
in
the
flavor
department
but
it
suits
this
beer
well
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
chilly
fall
evening
i
have
to
admit
i
saw
the
label
at
the
store
and
bought
some
but
tried
it
on
tap
first
at
duclaw
in
arundel
mills
now
im
glad
i
bought
it
deep
mahogany
to
black
in
color
with
subtle
carbonation
and
virtually
no
head
though
the
foam
at
the
edges
laced
the
glass
nicely
all
the
way
down
subtle
roasted
malt
dunkel
in
the
nose
and
a
very
emphasize
very
smooth
moderate
mouthfeel
at
initial
taste
flavor
was
fairly
straightforward
dunkel
not
really
sweet
but
rich
in
flavor
with
a
nice
bitterness
at
the
end
that
was
enhanced
in
a
flavorful
way
by
im
assuming
the
cinnamon
definitely
not
in
your
face
spiced
at
all
very
balanced
and
flavorful
the
spices
instead
enhance
the
flavors
of
the
beer
equally
drinkable
went
down
very
quickly
loved
every
second
of
it

d
really
enjoyed
this
ive
never
had
a
beer
so
saturated
with
spices
that
also
tasted
quite
good
pick
this
up
if
you
like
spicy
pumpkin
beers
d
an
interesting
creation
quite
sessionable
with
good
flavor
and
lots
of
character
i
always
enjoy
what
duclaw
has
to
offer
in
terms
of
creativity
a
nice
little
beer
that
those
into
creative
brewing
should
check
out
o
come
on
people
lets
give
duclaw
credit
for
this
one
i
know
this
is
not
a
popular
style
with
the
ba
crowd
due
to
its
low
abv
but
i
personally
think
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
deserves
to
be
ranked
up
there
with
the
big
dogs
this
is
now
my
favorite
duclaw
beer
o
this
was
an
awesome
brew
my
first
time
with
a
double
spiced
munich
dunkel
and
it
did
not
disappoint
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
alright
the
spices
made
it
interesting
but
nothing
too
special
i
dont
think
ill
search
it
out
again
o
i
figured
this
would
be
an
easy
drinking
lager
with
just
a
few
spices
added
but
i
was
wrong
this
came
across
pretty
much
as
a
pumpkin
ale
to
me
minus
the
actual
pumpkin
those
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
lager
characteristics
really
blended
together
nicely
d
not
bad
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
drinkability
this
one
grew
a
bit
tiring
as
the
pint
glass
emptied
interesting
effort
but
a
straight
up
dark
lager
would
have
worked
much
better
without
the
spice
d
one
and
done
for
me
i
still
dont
see
the
need
for
spices
much
like
last
springs
limited
seasonal
el
guapo
duclaw
has
snuck
this
one
in
between
monthly
releases
and
has
provided
yet
another
enjoyable
surprise
of
a
beer
that
is
both
tasty
and
quaffable
easy
drinkablily
and
a
satistying
falllike
spice
kick
definitley
make
this
halloween
release
more
treat
than
trick
hopefully
they
will
see
fit
to
release
this
again
sometime
down
the
line
clear

a

i
would
love
to
see
all
the
omb
beers
east
of
greensboro
clean
biscuity
malts
typical
of
omb
just
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
ive
had
a
few
of
olde
mecks
offerings
and
ill
be
damned
if
theyre
not
one
of
the
best
most
authentic
brewers
of
german
style
lagers
in
the
states
their
dunker
is
malty
and
clean
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
create
a
balance
thats
infinitely
quaffable
thanks
again
wil
a
new
favorite
the
first
one
weve
struggled
to
get
250
characters
on
overall
not
many
craft
brewers
try
the
german
styles
and
the
dunkel
in
particular
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
a
really
good
dunkel
great
flavor
and
highly
sessionable
o
a
drinkable
and
refreshingly
clean
beer
i
wish
the
flavor
had
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
but
its
still
tasty
smells
nice
and
is
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
isnt
a
flashy
beer
but
is
a
wellmade
and
tasty
dark
lager
old
mecklenburg
does
a
great
job
on
german
styles
and
this
is
no
exception

a

in
the
mouth
with
dryer
lightly
toasted
bread
flavors
along
with
some
light
nuttiness
and
mild

sweetness
its
a
more
subtle

and
its
good
for
easy

and
pairing
with

like
iam
doing

smell
is
of

slightly

taste
is
very
similar
ssweet

and
a
slight

note
really
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
this
is
a
very
nice
dunkel
not
quite
exceptional
caliber
but
still
very
good

nice
representation
of
the
syle
easy

option
of
purchasing
a

any
liquor
for
3
o
i
have
yet
to
find
a
good
dunkel
brewed
in
the
us
let
alone
one
that
holds
up
well
in
the
bottle
with
export
it
seems
that
us
brewers
just
love
that
roasty
character
but
a
good
dunkel
can
be
so
delicious
when
you
let
munich
and
pils
malt
do
their
thing
that
said
this
beer
is
certainly
wellmade
and
delicious
just
expect
more
of
a
schwarzbier
in
character
just
simple
straightforward
drinking
give
me
meat
and
bread
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
brewery
single
finger
frothy
head
slightly
off
white
with
good
retention
clear
and
amber
aroma
is
strong
and
mostly
consists
if
sweet
caramel
malts
more
caramel
malt
in
the
taste
with
a
spicy
and
slightly
bitter
hip
finish
medium
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
i
think
this
is
the
first
of
these
i
have
reviewed
so
new
to
the
genre
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
the
flavor
leans
towards
both
the
hops
and
the
sweetness
this
brewery
seems
to
like
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
it
is
pretty
tried
and
true
though
a
solid
dunkel
o
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
through
the
roof
its
very
clean
smooth
tasty
and
enjoyable
what
else
could
you
ask
for
hopefully
ill
be
able
pick
up
more
of
this
before
theyre
on
to
the
next
seasonal
great
brew
omb
daydreaming
of
beer
halls
in
munich
and
this
beer
appears
in
front
of
us
chestnut
darkness
lures
us
in
tight
head
on
top
is
not
big
enough
to
give
us
beer
mustaches
we
move
on
massive
onslaught
of
a
pleasing
breadiness
in
the
nose
with
hints
of
herbal
hop
firm
malty
palate
semidry
dark
bread
faint
sweet
edge
up
front
quite
toasty
middle
to
end
hops
for
balance
and
a
great
balance
there
is
with
undertones
of
wild
herbs
and
mint
this
lager
brings
us
further
into
that
daydream
of
us
drinking
liters
of
dunkel
which
makes
us
crave
fresh
bavarian
brezel
amazing
lighter
bodied
drinkability
is
a
no
brainer
only
problem
for
me
was
the
chocolate
became
a
little
odd
with
not
much
backing
it
up
one
of
the
best
dark
beers
available
right
now
the
bitterness
in
this
reminded
me
a
winter
warmer
it
poured
a
little
darker
than
omb
copper
it
smells
warm
and
sweet
the
taste
is
similar
but
more
bitter
i
like
omb
beer
because
it
is
always
filtered
to
be
crystal
clear
and
drinkable
i
enjoyed
alternating
between
this
and
copper
first
beer
i
have
had
from
omb
which
is
weird
considering
i
live
about
15
minutes
from
the
brewery
i
am
impressed
so
far
and
will
start
trying
to
find
a
little
bit
more
from
this
local
brewer
ontap
at
flying
saucer
charlotte
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
dark
copper
with
a
decent
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
mild
dark
malts
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
smooth
dark
malts
with
a
nice
caramel
finish
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
lager
for
a
winter
afternoon
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
thick
whitish
head
and
a
good
amount
of
residual
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
a
little
pecan
and
maybe
toffee
tastes
of
roasted
malts
pecan
walnut
caramel
and
again
maybe
toffee
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
fairly
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
workinprogress
dunkel
i
feel
like
could
use
a
little
more
character
as
it
seems
to
have
not
yet
hit
its
stride
a
la
the
alt
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
wow
just
another
well
crafted
german
style
here
and
these
guys
are
definitely
impressing
me
more
and
more
with
each
offering
that
i
have
from
here
this
is
a
great
seasonal
that
i
would
be
drinking
a
ton
of
if
it
was
local
to
me
d
extremely
drinkable
brew
hope
to
see
this
around
in
charlotte
for
some
time

good

old

full
of

very
smooth
and
clean
with
nice
sweet
caramel
and
smoked
malt
taste
strange
up
front
taste
and
very
bland
aftertaste
o
this
beer
is
unique
in
its
inoffensiveness
i
know
that
sounds
like
faint
praise
or
a
lefthanded
compliment
but
sometimes
its
just
what
youre
looking
for
it
lacks
any
sort
of
sensational
characteristic
that
might
normally
appeal
to
someone
trying
to
break
into
craft
beer
personally
i
quite
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
about
the
only
real
letdown
to
describe
the
taste
just
think
about
every
budweiser
michelob
and
coors
you
have
ever
had
and
make
it
less
interesting
all
of
those
beers
are
drinkable
in
my
book
but
track
1
has
come
in
at
6
dollars
a
pint
at
a
bar
down
the
street
it
is
almost
4
bucks
for
a
22
at
the
grocery
store
it
is
beyond
mediocre
at
best
and
i
prefer
budweiser
to
it
1553
overall
a
fine
lager
the
worse
part
was
that
i
found
it
in
the
grocery
store
along
with
some
other
local
favorites
of
mine
i
hate
to
think
that
a
potential
craft
beer
convert
would
try
this
beer
and
think
this
is
what
craft
beer
is
all
about
it
would
definitely
be
a
turnoff
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tall
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
little
white
head
but
dissipates
very
quickly
smells
of
darkly
roasted
caramelized
malt
not
much
else
has
a
very
bland
taste
a
little
dark
malt
but
watery
light
bodied
beer
has
a
nice
finish
but
is
a
little
fizzy
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
bad
news
here
folks
overall
solid
brew
not
something
id
buy
again
really
but
its
a
solid
brew
o
nice
simple
beer
very
cleanly
executed
and
balanced
o
this
is
a
tasty
and
solid
brew
from
roanoke
railhouse
i
have
had
this
numerous
times
now
from
both
the
bottle
and
ontap
and
have
decided
that
getting
it
ontap
is
slightly
better
with
a
more
flavorful
taste
this
flagship
beer
is
definitely
sessionable
and
makes
a
great
pairing
with
pub
fare
for
sure
im
sure
ill
have
this
brew
again
especially
now
that
its
being
distributed
in
richmond
the
taste
has
that
banana
quality
that
i
really
like
it
accents
the
light
body
and
caramely
smoothness
light
body
and
easy
drinking
munich
dunkel
o
not
a
great
example
of
the
style

too
many
bad

be
liked

good

clear

with
thin
offwhite

that
is
not

the
scent
very
weak

and
a
bitter

the
taste
is
primarily
a
bitter
taste
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
decent
carbonation
overall
it
is
not
a
decent
beer
and
i
would
not
session
this
would
rather
do
a
coors
lite
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
a
lager
light
but
not
watery
this
is
a
nice
light
brew
with
a
strong
flavor
if
you
would
like
to
try
a
smoky
beer
this
is
a
very
approachable
one
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
this
was
but
it
does
make
a
bit
more
sense
after
i
saw
it
was
a
dunkel
lager
a
12
ounce
would
have
been
enough
of
this
one

a
nice

taste
is
a
smooth

offering
with
hints
of
yeast
very
crisp
on
the

very
carbonated
overall
not
bad
especially
at
4
for
the
22oz
at
whole
foods
o
quite
drinkable
alright
flavor
would
be
better
if
the
mouthfeel
had
some
oomph
its
cheap
and
its
local
the
hight
points
sadly
theres
nothing
about
the
drinking
experience
that
makes
me
want
to
buy
this
beer
again

a

missing
the
overall
finesse
and
cohesiveness
of
a
well
made
germanstyle

not
terrible
though
overall
this
is
an
easydrinking
session
beer
that
also
has
a
very
pronounced

hardly
overwhelming
profile
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better

brews
i
have
had
interesting
first
offering
from
these
virginia
brewers
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
looking
for
something
quaffable
overall
its
a
good
beer
if
you
see
it
try
it
you
will

this

never

not

somewhat
dry
at

flavor
sticks
around
just
long
enough
hops
are
there
but
not
over
the
top
its
pretty
regional
but
id
recommend
picking
one
up
its
definately
worth
a
try
looking

to
their

i
look

the
style
and
with
nequality
clarity
nose
revealed
one
big
malt
bomb
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
the
taste
reminded
me
of
brown
bread
i
have
written
before
about
bm
brown
bread
but
this
seems
like
what
it
would
taste
like
in
liquid
form
obviously
this
was
a
very
bready
beer
finish
was
semisweet
with
a
lot
of
the
fermentable
sugars
having
been
converted
into
alcohol
impressive
not
so
much
cool
as
a
novelty
from
israel
heck
yes
o
this
was
okay
it
tasted
a
bit
cheap
but
it
was
easy
to
drink
nothing
stood
out
negative
or
positive
rjt
pours
a
four
finger
light
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
traces
of
lace
almost
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
lightmedium

malty

flavor
is
light
caramel
malt
hops
stay

good
lawnmower
beer
330ml
bottle
from
gift
specialists
oceanside
california
nothing
amazing
but
nice
and
drinkable
its
drinkable
but
not
that
memorable
overall
okay
it
was
a
novelty
to
try
from
israel
but
wouldnt
seek
out
again
if
you
are
in
israel
try
one
and
then
feel
sad
that
this
is
their
best
option
i
end
by
saying
something
nice
it
is
an
easytodrink
and
refreshing
highly
carbonated
beer
which
is
better
than
the
massproduced
american
lagers
piss
overall
meh
cheap
lager
tastes
bitterness
from
hard
minerals
in
the
water
i
think
or
something
like
that
and
some
over
stressed
yeast
although
there
were
decent
malts
o
the
aroma
and
look
on
this
one
arent
too
bad
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
totally
disappointing
i
cant
say
for
sure
if
anything
went
wrong
in
the
transportation
process
but
the
stale
character
of
the
hops
could
point
to
oxidation
i
dont
hate
it
but
barely
a
step
up
from
american
adjuncts
if
i
find
myself
in
israel
which
odds
are
i
will
in
the
near
future
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
in
short
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
from
a
strange
and
distant
land
without
any
distictive
attributes
or
factors
overall
i
was
expecting
worse
goldstar
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
are
spending
some
time
in
israel
but
you
should
track
down
some
taybeh
anyway
not
a
great
beer
but
certainly
better
than
many
its
clean
and
drinkable
at
least
and
with
a
small
amount
of
flavour
its
still
very
average
in
the
large
scheme
of
things
however
d
an
ok
beer
but
nothingh
special
at
all
it
was
actually
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
in
the
end
a
bit
forgettable
wouldnt
seek
out
but
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
having
again
this
is
israeli
pride
and
you
can
ask
anyone
here
and
theyll
say
the
same
smells
and
tastes
like
half
alehalf
lager
there
is
a
faint
dry
red
wine
characteristic
to
this
beer
that
would
be
excellent
if
it
were
more
pronounced
i
admit
i
drank
this
begrudgingly
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
would
order
again
all
in
all
id
pass
but
if
youre
in
israel
might
as
well
try
it
since
there
arent
many
breweries
picked
up
a
bottle
from
abes
cold
beer
it
wasnt
dated
but
it
also
wasnt
dusty
so
i
ave
it
a
shot
it
appears
a
clear
amber
more
like
an
oktoberfest
than
a
dunkel
it
also
tastes
more
like
an
export
lager
with
sweet
bready
malt
at
first
once
it
warms
a
touch
though
theres
a
dry
caramel
note
for
the
finish
with
a
little
yeasty
bite
this
beer
reminds
me
sort
of
of
yuengling
as
an
easy
to
drink
probablyadjunct
lager
its
largely
inoffensive
and
has
some
pleasant
character
if
youre
curious
and
want
to
try
an
israeli
beer
grab
this
one
i
could
easily
drink
5
or
6
of
these
in
a
sitting
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
crisp
plenty
of
malts
and
slightly
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
cant
find
much
that
stands
out
about
this
one
goldstar
is
a
crystal
clear
golden
beer
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
theres
not
much
aroma
maybe
funk
and
lemon
it
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
theres
not
much
flavor
its
a
little
funky
almost
salty
a
touch
sweet
with
a
hint
of
lemon
its
ok
for
a
lager
it
had
a
decent
toasted
nut
taste
to
it
it
was
slightly
carbonated
and
goes
down
very
easy
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
d
not
outstanding
but
it
lives
up
to
its
expectations
as
a
beer
which
was
meant
to
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
at
mangals
israeli
bbq
s
i
cold
have
a
few
of
these
along
with
some
kebabs
and
skewers
of
meat
light
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
i
really
didnt
get
much
on
aroma
taste
is
kind
of
bready
and
bitter
this
is
something
that
is
the
perfect
definition
of
bland
well
i
tried
it
once
and
that
is
enough
you
are
not
missing
anything
if
you
never
drink
one
good
drinkability
i
suppose
drinkability
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
skip
this
one
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
tel
aviv
a
darker
lightbrown
lager
with
a
somewhat
average
appearance
poured
with
minimal
or
no
head
there
really
wasnt
much
to
judge
by
way
of
smell
the
beer
had
a
grainy
aroma
which
didnt
stand
out
but
instead
blends
in
with
most
other
lagers
the
taste
was
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
wasnt
expecting
much
but
it
didnt
dissapoint
somewhat
sweet
bready
flavors
lend
an
average
mouthfeel
seemed
lighter
on
tap
than
in
bottle
form
but
either
way
the
drinkability
is
very
good
goes
down
light
and
smooth
with
a
modest
alcohol
percentage
havent
seen
this
one
in
america
but
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
in
europe

to

a

the
color

smell
was
pretty
bland
kind
of
bready
kind
of
hoppy
just
like
your
average
macro
beer
taste
was
similarly
uninspiring
some
yeast
some
light

crispness
not
much
else
not
bad
but
the
same
normal
blah
beer
that
you
can
find
anywhere
seemed
to
be
a
session
beer
i
was
however
surprised
by
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
more
creamy
than
i
expected
which
i
liked
basically
average
in
almost
every
respect
drinkability
this
is
a
quaffable
brew
i
dont
generally
love
this
style
but
this
one
works
for
me
its
been
since
1998
on
a
stay
in
a
kibbutz
that
i
imbibed
my
fair
share
of
gold
star
we
would
buy
cases
of
bottles
and
go
through
them
on
the
weekends
nothing
special
about
this
beer
but
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
with
a
dark
gold
color
and
taste
that
placed
it
above
most
us
macrobrews
in
israel
goldstar
is
available
everywhere
in
cans
and
bottles
but
its
better
to
consume
it
on
draught
this
brand
is
slowly
disappearing
from
fancy
pubs
but
still
is
served
in
most
of
israeli
cafes
the
colour
is
copperred
or
dark
amber
whatever
you
like
the
taste
is
simple
but
good
balance
is
a
fair
compensation
for
lack
of
sofistication
hearty
beer
not
strong
but
certainly
not
bland
designed
for
consuming
in
large
volumes
this
is
my
first
aluminum
bottle
and
i
must
say
that
there
is
a
benefit
of
being
able
to
print
the
design
over
the
whole
bottle
rather
than
just
the
label
looks
cool
thanks
to
my
uncle
for
bringing
this
all
the
way
from
israel
the
only
words
in
english
on
the
bottle
were
genuine
draft
apparently
this
is
more
important
than
the
name
of
the
brewery
or
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
brown
color
with
very
little
head
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
but
not
much
else
taste
is
boring
nothing
exciting
at
all
slightly
hoppy
slightly
malty
but
thats
it
this
was
my
first
israeli
beer
and
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
here
but
i
found
less
the
taste
is
heavily
toasted
bread
fermenting
plums
hints
of
earth
chocolate
and
burnt
sugar
it
starts
off
a
little
sweet
up
front
with
faint
sourness
and
burnt
bitterness
however
the
finish
is
more
interesting
lightly
spiceypeppery
with
a
quality
of
root
beer
mixed
with
burnt
toast
its
mostyl
rather
bland
but
it
does
have
a
little
complexity
and
is
light
and
rather
drinkable
it
seems
a
pretty
middleof
the
road
dunkel
for
me
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
poured
a
chocolate
brown
with
a
small
and
quick
fading
light
tan
head
and
minimal
lacing
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
fairly
smooth
nose
roasted
malts
and
some
roasted
nuts
flavor
is
of
burnt
malts
and
some
chocolate
sweet
finish
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
easy
going
dunkel
with
good
concentration
and
solid
flavors
just
a
bit
thin
on
the
texture
and
body
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
little
head
that
dropped
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
which
left
a
little
lacing
it
had
a
hazy
appearance
which
surprised
me
a
little
i
was
expecting
a
dark
beer
but
with
clarity
which
this
didnt
have
it
has
a
sweet
malty
smell
with
no
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
some
toffee
notes
carrying
it
through
finishing
clean
this
one
is
all
malt
but
it
is
good
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
a
pleasure
going
down
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
little
too
sweet
and
maybe
too
onedimensional
to
really
stand
out
but
interesting
enough
to
be
enjoyable
my
second
dark
lager
of
the
evening
a
murky
brown
lager
that
pour
with
ample
carbonation
but
somehow
the
head
falls
flat
disappointing
the
nose
is
interesting
sort
of
a
caramel
and
chocolate
affair
tastes
almost
like
a
weizenbock
to
me
with
a
soft
mouthfeel
and
sweet
caramel
malt
and
toffee
flavors
the
bitterness
is
restrained
but
a
tart
mineralladen
finish
is
sort
of
interesting
this
lager
comes
across
fairly
hearty
for
its
four
percent
alcohol
and
its
fruity
character
buried
underneath
the
caramel
malt
almost
has
thinking
of
british
mild
overall
this
is
a
lager
that
drinks
more
like
an
ale
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
fruitier
and
more
tart
i
would
like
to
experience
this
beer
on
tap
12
oz
brown
longneck
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
a
lightlyhazed
mahogany
with
medium
carbonation
topped
with
an
inch
of
khaki
head
that
leaves
light
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
caramel
lightly
roasted
and
dark
malts
backed
by
an
almost
cloying
sweetness
to
which
the
flavor
adds
lightly
citric
hops
that
contribute
a
mild
bitterness
on
top
of
a
light
tingly
body
that
imparts
a
medium
finish
overall
not
too
bad
but
its
lacking
a
certain
something
glad
to
try
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
revisit
pours
a
rather
quiet
deep
mahogany
with
scant
tan
head
and
similarly
whimpy
lace
the
aroma
captures
a
fairly
typical
molassesbrown
sugar
malt
quality
fairly
strong
with
a
touch
of
grassy
highlight
the
first
taste
brings
a
mildly
carbonated
brown
sugar
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
almost
a
bit
flat
as
suggested
by
the
lack
of
foam
and
lace
there
is
some
grapefruit
hidden
in
here
as
well
as
you
go
along
i
think
it
grows
on
you
and
shows
some
complexity
id
like
to
see
more
wholesome
carbonation
but
the
flavor
appeals
to
me
quite
sweet
this
is
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
it
would
stand
up
to
drinking
more
than
a
couple
needs
a
little
more
body
or
something
but
not
bad
not
a
bad
dunkel
but
no
real
excitement
however
a
good
session
beer
given
the
abv
and
middle
of
the
road
character
d
a
pretty
smooth
beer
overall
it
is
a
pleasant
lager
but
it
isnt
worth
hunting
down
pours
a
deep
brown
with
almost
zero
tan
headskie
sweet
chewy
nose
well
balanced
goes
down
very
smooth
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
if
it
were
just
a
touch
less
sweet
i
could
drink
it
all
night
a
very
decent
dark
lager
quite
surprised
to
run
into
this
one
but
im
glad
i
picked
it
up

a

the
taste
is
pretty
much

maybe
just
a
touch
nutty
toward
the
end
i
would
expect
a
more

beer
this
color
the
mouthfeel
seems
a

not
bad
but
not
really
good
either

just
like
this

again
sometime
this
was
one
of
those
beers
i
bought
on
a
whim
never
heard
of
it
but
i
am
slowly
learning
about
munich
dunkels
i
am
now
hooked
on
this
beer
i
will
definately
be
looking
for
it
in
the
future
drikability
a
very
drinkable
dunkel
lager
from
the
czech
republic
in
the
munich
style
not
an
overwhelming
heavy
brew
but
a
good
cooler
day
sipper
it
has
a
creamy
finish
and
i
think
i
will
have
another
great
beer
fo
a
couple
but
not
too
many
lighter
alcohol
feel
and
taste
could
probably
get
you
later
on
if
you
push
it
a
great
beer

try

it
out

it
could
be
a
killer

for

you
want
something

a
nice
example
of
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
nice

with
good

and
at

i
could
drink
these
all

is
slightly
past
its
prime
but
still
good
i
have
had
fresher
examples
in
the
past
that
were
even
better
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
introduction
to
czech
dark
lagers
look
for
one
of
these
overall
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
doesnt
leave
a
lasting
impression
easy
to
consume
easy
to
forget
22
ounce
bottle
klaister
dark
beer
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
malty
cookie
dough
aroma
and
faint
hops
the
flavor
is
sort
of
dopplebock
like
rich
chewy
malts
lighty
hopped
some
chocolate
notes
just
a
little
bit
fruity
theres
a
weird
flavor
thats
like
bubblegum
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
sweet
but
not
cloying
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
average
i
enjoyed
my
bottle
but
i
doubt
id
want
another
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
prefer
their
pilsner
well
done
easy
drinker
will
make
a
great
session
type
beer
klaster
dark
beer
is
a
passable
czech
version
of
a
munich
dunkel
lager
but
thats
as
far
as
im
willing
to
go
ive
had
good
versions
of
the
style
so
i
know
they
exist
unfortunately
this
one
cant
be
counted
among
them
pours
a
dark
brown
nearing
on
black
with
a
short
tan
head
smells
of
bitter
coffee
and
malts
with
some
dark
fruit
taste
has
the
bitter
coffee
then
strange
dark
fruits
reminding
me
of
black
boss
porter
and
ending
with
an
apple
cider
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
smooth
overall
an
alright
drinker
lots
of
flavors
but
they
dont
always
jive
worth
a
try
though
smell
was
mild
malt
and
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
was
pretty
much
what
the
nose
gave
hints
of
mild
finish
after
a
thin
but
not
watery
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
experience
if
not
special
quite
a
nice
sweeterstyled
dunkel
lager
i
poured
out
half
my
sample
go
for
the
winter
lager
pours
out
with
a
little
head
which
turns
into
absolutely
nothing
beer
looks
flat
as
hell
with
no
lacing
at
all
color
is
a
dark
brownish
red
has
a
somewhat
pleasant
bready
vanilla
like
smell
to
it
smells
better
than
it
looks
to
be
sure
tastes
quite
sweet
initially
then
turning
somewhat
salty
with
a
doughy
maltiness
cannot
pick
out
much
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
of
little
carbonation
bubbles
on
the
tongue
i
suppose
with
such
low
abv
this
could
be
a
session
beer
but
with
so
many
better
choices
out
there
why
would
you
a
good
and
highly
drinkable
beer
though
a
little
strange
for
a
dunkel
lager
from
the
bottle
poured
reddish

with
a

didnt

this
one

a
good
session

pours
a
slightly
red

brown
no

whatsoever
slight
carbonation
the
aroma
is
very
very
mild
malts
and
hops
nothing
else
of
note
really
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
malt
toffee
and
molasses
it
reminds
me
of
the
breads
my
mom
makes
during
the
holidays
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
but
finishes
watered
down
still
this
makes
a
great
beer
to
sit
down
with
a
sixpack
and
watch
games
all
afternoon
really
goes
down

no
rough
edges

wow
really
let
down
by
this

i
really
like
the

this
falls
way
way
short
of
those
twoill
stick
with
them
this
is
dessert
in

a
most
excellent
brew
a
tasty
brew
only
drawback
is
that
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet

it

drinkability

this
is
a
good
very
dark
example
of
the
style
poured
a
chocolate
colour
with
little
head
if
any
strong
hints
of
molasses
and
caramel
in
both
the
taste
and
aroma
not
a
bad
beer
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
was
very
comfortable
the
biggest
downfall
was
the
super
sweetness
other
than
that
not
too
shabby
klaster
dark
is
enjoyable
but
not
compelling
poured
from

longneck
green
12
oz
bottle
its
a
nicelooking
brown
with
just
a
hint
of
red
the
smell
is
chocolate
and
just
a
bit
of
caramel
with
some
spice
on
the
back
end
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
lots
of
flavors
floating
around
despite
the
low
abv
anyone
looking
for
a
new
session
beer
a
bit
of
a
lightweight
but
pleasant
enough
this
is
a
deep
brown
color
almost
black
the
low
carbonation
produces
a
thin
tan
head
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
beer
appears
quite
clear
with
deep
red
notes
there
are
slight
roasted
malt
aromas
in
the
nose
this
is
quite
a
sweet
beer
and
is
fairly
light
bodied
as
well
the
sweetness
reminds
me
of
a
lactose
stout
this
is
not
very
roasted
tasting
the
predominant
taste
impression
is
one
of
sweetness
pours
a
nice
red
black
color
but
lacks
head
smell
is
pleasing
hoppy
and
fresh
if
it
is
possible
for
a
beer
to
smell
fresh
taste
is
rather
good
very
sweet
even
for
a
czech
dark
lager
but
still
refreshing
and
not
syruplike
could
use
a
little
more
hops
goes
down
easy
better
than
average
but
not
great
a
solid
czech
dunkel
the
dry
finish
is
my
favorite
feature
because
its
so
different
from
other
dark
lagers
which
normally
finish
very
sweet
new
beer
to
try
i
was
leery
due
to
the
green
bottle
but
it
turned
out
ok
poured
very
dark
with
little
head
coffee
and
malt
nose
lots
of

you
to

but
its
a

quaffer
maybe
my
opinion
isnt
important
but
not
much
of
a
fan
of
dunkels
this
one
didnt
stand
out
overall
a
tasty
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
and
enjoy
the
german
varieties
very
much
this
doesnt
exactly
stand
up
to
its
german
counterparts
but
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
dunkel
and
this
was
on
tap
i
would
not
pass
it
up
drinkability
begs
for
a
liter
mug
would
buy
it
again
for
sure
left
wanting
on
the
taste
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
but
i
had
to
knock
it
down
for
the
slight
flatness
of
this
pour
again
that
may
be
because
of
the
local
tap
i
will
amend
this
review
if
i
that
turns
out
to
be
the
case
not
impressed
at
all
rather
average
flat
tasting
with
no
body
cheers
o
not
an
amazing
beer
but
a
good
one
to
pair
with
food
thanks
to
its
easygoing
nature
ill
probably
return
to
this
one
again
just
not
on
a
frequent
basis
o
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
the
cocoa
aspect
of
this
beer
the
skunked
metallic
flavor
was
not
my
favorite
peace
poured
ontap
at
the
brewery
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
chestnut
coloring
with
a
filmy
clingy
white
head
nose
of
roast
notes
coffee
and
dark
caramel
and
some
fig
and
date
notes
flavors
are
roast
and
nutty
forward
with
some
old
world
fruit
sweet
highlights
and
a
bitter
undertone
smooth
and
crisp
bodied
with
a
tangy
caramel
sweetness
and
roasted
notes
crisp
clean
finish
with
a
sweet
linger
very
solid
brew
its
not
bad
but
the
super
spritzy
mouthfeel
just
slices
through
the
palate
and
destroys
much
of
the
flavor
that
seemed
to
be
hinted
on
the
nose
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
date
outstanding
lager
i
dont
know
a
whole
lot
about
mother
earth
brewing
but
i
know
that
this
beer
alone
has
made
me
interested
in
their
other
stuff
dark
cloud
pours
into
a
ruby
color
with
significant
lacing
its
smell
is
a
complex
blend
of
coffee
toffee
and
malts
amongst
others
the
taste
is
bready
chocolatey
and
a
little
malty
with
a
late
rush
of
toffee
sweetness
honestly
its
difficult
to
even
detect
any
hoppy
bitterness
it
feels
very
wellbalanced
and
mediumbodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
lager
but
far
more
complex
than
that
designation
might
suggest
an
awesome
achievement
for
a
carolina
brewery
drinkability
this
is
solid
stuff
it
likely
sets
the
bar
for
the
boldest
versions
of
the
style
at
least
as
far
as
i
have
experienced
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
but
offers
some
complex
flavors
from
the
munich
malts
and
noble
hops
really
like
this
one
and
will
keep
it
in
mind
next
time
i
am
in
the
mood
for
something
other
than
the
usual
very
interested
in
trying
out
more
beers
from
mother
earth
d
a
little
dull
for
me
but
a
nice
session
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
excellent
example
of
a
munich
dunkel
lager
being
produced
by
a
small
brewery
in
eastern
nc
not
one
of
the
more
common
styles
for
american
craft
breweries
this
was
a
delicious
beer
and
one
i
was
very
happy
to
drink
it
is
sessionable
and
i
would
be
happy
to
have
another
of
these
o
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
to
flip
out
about
maybe
this
beer
just
isnt
my
style
because
this
is
the
second
ive
had
of
this
type
that
wasnt
memorable
enjoyable
nonetheless
overall
easy
drinking
and
highly
approachable
its
a
solid
dunkel
overall
this
is
pretty
good
i
would
certainly
drink
it
from
time
to
time
if
i
could
first
time
drinking
a
dunkel
lager
this
is
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
ooverall
this
was
an
enjoyable
session
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
quanity
the
beer
was
fresh
and
free
of
defects
these
folks
seem
to
take
real
pride
in
their
beer
all
the
way
from
the
label
art
through
to
the
clean
flavors
and
tight
adherence

even
the
whole
thing
out

very
strong
example
of
a
dunkel
in
my
book
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
beers
from
these
folks
an
excellent
accompanyment
for
food

slightly
higher
than

some

taste
matches
with

bitterness

is

this
beer
does
get
better
as
it
warms
up
which
frequently
is
the
case
with
most
beers
i
like
though
not
always
with
layers
body
is
mediumlight
and
this
goes
down
very
easy
overall
nothing
earthshattering
but
very
well
executed
like
a
great
12bar
blues
not
bad
at
all
a
bit
boring
and
a
bit
dry
for
me
pleasant
and
smooth

perfectly

to
have

something
from

solid

of

style
a
woody
bitterness
flashes
across
the
tongue
then
disappears
just
as
fast
not
as
slick
and
sweet
as
the
german
incarnations
but
still
very
good
in
its
own
right
strong
malty
aroma
is
slightly
musky
and
has
earthy
molasses
and
nutty
notes
it
pours
a
somewhat
translucent
sepia
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
persistent
wheatbrown
head
that
leaves
considerable
lacing
rich
flavor

a
malty
core
and
caramel
earthy
nutty

notes
firmbodied
texture
is
smooth
yet
rather
tingly
leaving
an
earthy
woody
finish
eminently
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
pretty
solid
well
rounded
beer
for
the
style
this
is
all
around
right
quite
a
tasty
beer
the
toasted
malts
in
the
smell
are
a
little
funny
but
everything
else
about
it
is
solid
i
like
it
for
me
this
is
a
solid
b
munich
dunkel
keep
on
representing
tar
heel
brewers
o
a
very
good
beer
that
is
worth
grabbing
wish
it
were
available
up
here
well
done
recreating
a
munich
dunkel
lager
o
one
of
the
best
of
style
in
my
experience
cheers
this
beer
is
hard
to
characterize
for
me
i
have
been
on
a
dark
beer
kick
lately
and
i
thought
maybe
this
might
be
fun
to
try
since
its
a
local
company
overall
this
beer
looked
and
tasted
just
fine
i
probably
wouldnt
go
far
beyond
that
i
think
it
rates
in
the
b
area
for
me
i
think
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
the
style
than
you
ought
to
really
dig
where
this
dunkel
is
coming
from
dedrinkeraug

smells
good
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
dunkels
i
have
ever
had
i
wish
more
breweries
stateside
would
brew
this
underrated
style
has
a
nice
sweetroast
interplay
and
the
body
is
plenty
full
very
smooth
beer
that
goes
down
so
easy
drinkability

especially
now
that
the
months
are
getting
colder
not
bad
and
a
bit
of
semisweet
chocolate
the
texture
is
very
creamy
with
only
a
very
fine
carbonation
giving
it
any
energy
overall
and
roast
helped
create
a
deep
tang
to
the
taste
that
got
to
be
a
little
much
at
times

a
really
solid
effort
from
a
new
brewery
im
glad
a
nc
brewery
has
finally
produced
a
nice
lager
having
local
access
to
this
along
with
some
toffee
and
coffee
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the

dark

o
i
certainly
liked
this
beer
it
had
good
flavor
and
was
very
drinkable
if
underwhelming
however
the
scent
of
the
beer
was
great
complex
and
inviting
it
was
a
very
pleasant
aroma
i
do
not
want
to
sound
like
someone
who
dismisses
macro
brews
but
i
feel
like
that
is
what
is
holding
this
beer
back
perhaps
thats
just
my
bias
still
it
is
worth
a
try
and
is
a
good
option
if
the
selection
is
otherwise
limited
flavorful
rich
but
not
heavy
intense
dry
malt
i
thought
it
was
worth
drinking
overall
this
beer
suffers
from
green
bottle
syndrome
but
is
otherwise
sessionable
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
creamy
brown
pour
from
the
bottle
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
a
sweet
roasty
malt
rather
rich
with
some
spice
flavor
follows
closely
with
deep
sweet
malt
flavors
roast
watery
chocolate
the
finish
here
is
a
bit
rough
just
like
other
st
paulis
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
for
the
abv
with
adequate
carbonation
i
find
this
very
similar
to
leinies
dark
though
not
nearly
as
pleasant
cant
recommend
this
one
but
not
nearly
as
awful
as
the
regular
st
pauli
o
havent
had
it
in
a
while
better
than
i
remember
a
smooth
drinker
with
german
attitude
clear
dark
brown
pour
fast
dissipating
fine
white
head
lightly
roasted
malty
aroma
and
sweetness
flavor
with
a
tad
bit
of
biscuit
and
bitter
spices
from
the
hops
in
short
its
just
a
below
average
dunkel
and
probably
not
the
best
example
of
the
class
but
its
still
easily
drinkable
and
if
i
was
to
describe
this
beer
it
would
be
like
a
watery
pilsner
with
lightly
roasted
malts
pours
a
clear
dark
reddishorange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
bread
taste
is
much
the
same
with
burnt
and
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
slightly
below
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
drink
again
i
was
expectedhoping
for
a
more
shall
we
say
ethnic
version
of
the
girl
on
the
label
oh
well
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
garnetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
barley
very
light
and
watereddown
cola
and
verylightlytoasted
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
thorough
sense
of
sourdoughish
bread
pervading
the
proceedings
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
pretty
limp
beer
with
hardly
any
character
to
its
name
thankfully
though
this
means
it
has
little
in
the
way
of
true
offensiveness
as
well
but
thats
a
pittance
of
a
consolation
o
although
this
beer
came
in
a
green
bottle
it
doesnt
taste
skunked
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
better
than
the
pale
lager
but
a
ways
away
from
a
good
dunkel
that
said
it
would
be
an
acceptable
choice
in
a
pinch
o
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
sessionable
and
would
definitely
be
worth
having
again
saw
this
in
the
store
and
it
called
to
me
and
wow
glad
i
did
great
color
almost
black
very
tasty
this
beer
works
for
maybe
on
a
winter
day
or
a
summer
day
this
beer
taste
great
and
looks
great
it
offers
something
for
people
who
dont
like
heavy
beers
just
right
in
the
middle
its
german
and
it
dark
and
i
like
for
a
slow
night
in
november
not
a
bad
beer
enjoy
o
overall
an
ok
beer
but
can
do
without
it
maybe
just
not
my
style
or
fitting
in
my
taste
zone
o
id
say
this
was
an
averagetasting
dunkel
definitely
some
issues
with
this
brew
there
are
many
better
in
this
style
not
great
not
bad
o
this
is
far
from
terrible
or
undrinkable
but
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
good
dunkel
this
should
not
be
your
plan
a
in
fact
it
likely
should
not
be
your
plan
b
c
or
d
you
get
the
picture
easy
to
drink
nice
variety
of
flavor
the
carbonation
was
good
but
i
would
have
liked
more
this
is
a
totally
decent
beer
o
basic
eurolager
its
nothing
great
but
it
was
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
drinkability
paired
this
with
breakfast
eggs
homefries
and
bacon
worked
well
could
be
a
little
less
tanic
decent
over
all
i
like
this
and
feel
as
if
this
could
be
a
good
fallback
session
beer
if
in
need
of
something
to
drink
a
decent
amount
of
but
dont
want
a
macro
brew
with
a
bit
more
presence
on
the
palette
less
water
plus
a
better
head
retention
i
think
this
could
easily
be
a
much
better
beer
o
goes
down
easy
not
great
but
not
bad
for
a
north
german
beer
i
used
an
aggro
pour
to
divine
as
much
head
as
possible
and
lo
and
behold
just
under
two
fingers
of
deeptan
head
with
excellent
retention
appeared
color
was
special
and
dark
it
looked
like
a
museumquality
ruby
with
nequality
clarity
my
uncle
is
a
geologist
who
volunteers
in
a
museum
and
i
have
held
a
ruby
of
this
color
cest
magnifique
nose
smelled
of
coffee
chocolate
and
grassy
hops
i
love
a
mashupmelange
and
this
seemed
poised
to
satisfy
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
but
the
flavor
began
with
a
saaz
hops
bite
then
kicked
in
with
a
light
roastiness
and
i
was
sent
man
this
was
about
the
best
beer
yet
today
which
my
not
be
saying
much
but
it
was
more
than
i
had
hoped
for
going
into
it
finish
was
semidry
and
the
roastyhoppy
flavor
lingered
well
after
the
swallow
again
being
realistic
it
may
not
have
been
any
great
shakes
but
if
you
see
it
next
to
its
white
bread
sameold
sameold
sister
try
some
strange
for
yourself
dont
knock
it
til
youve
tried
it
dig
this
beer
is
okay
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
and
cant
imagine
i
would
choose
it
over
anything
else
that
was
available
st
pauli
girl
special
dark
is
an
easy
drinking
light
flavored
dunkel
making
it
a
good
session
brew
if
you
are
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
from
a
light
in
color
golden
lager
beer
to
drink
during
the
hot
months
this
could
be
the
one
for
you
overall
this
beer
does
not
have
any
characters
that
make
you
want
to
drink
more
than
one
not
recommended
by
this
guy
overall
it
basically
tastes
like
your
basic
eurolager
with
a
touch
of
smoke
and
raisins
its
nothing
spectacular
but
it
was
quite
drinkable
not
something
id
buy
again
however
smells
slightly
of
honey
and
malty
sugar
in
the
mouth
nuts
and
dark
sugars
proliferate
caramels
toffees
and
deep
syrups
lightly
hopped
and
sparkling
on
the
tongue
this
brew
is
quite
flavorful
and
has
a
mouthfeel
of
carbonated
water
quite
decent
fare
a
good
introduction
to
brown
ales
and
such
mediumheavy
fares
for
those
not
acquainted
with
anything
bearing
any
severity
o
eh
nothing
special
about
this
beer
poor
example
of
a
dark
lager
in
my
opinion
poured
from
a
green
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mostly
of
malts
taste
has
malts
a
bit
of
nuttiness
some
grains
just
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
ofor
what
it
is
i
love
it
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
german
lager
this
will
hit
the
spot
d
not
bad
overall
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
id
very
much
like
to
taste
it
fresh
or
from
a
keg
i
get
the
impression
that
it
would
fare
much
better
than
the
imported
bottles
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
shade
of
brown
the
head
was
a
little
fizzy
but
still
had
some
left
over
clumps
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
little
bit
of
the
skunky
lager
aroma
going
on
but
was
almost
hidden
by
the
sweeter
malts
in
the
brew
the
taste
of
this
brew
had
good
flavor
all
around
the
sweet
caramel
malts
work
well
with
the
lager
elements
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
on
the
lighter
side
but
had
enough
body
to
remain
flavorful
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
from
time
to
time
i
would
pick
it
over
a
becks
dark
and
a
few
others
out
there
any
day
overall
this
was
a
nice
little
dark
lager
better
then
i
expected
it
was
very
light
in
feel
and
flavor
and
served
cold
went
down
very
easily
o
regardless
of
the
best
by
date
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
beer
here
didnt
finish
this
one
will
post
an
update
in
the
future
overall
meh
if
you
want
a
dark
euro
lager
you
can
probably
do
better
but
this
isnt
bad
in
and
of
itself
hohum
taste
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
do
pick
up
some
toasty
malts
dry
and
bitter
but
mostly
the
skunky
aroma
dominates
a
beer
that
i
wont
ever
order
in
a
bar
or
resturant
d
smooth
enough
but
mineral
taste
and
skunk
make
it
hard
to
drink
thin
but
not
as
watery
as
most
points
for
that
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
thin
cap
of
khaki
head
diminishing
quickly
scent
is
pale
mostly
carmel
malt
and
some
earthy
hops
taste
starts
of
with
a
mild
sweetness
and
some
earthyness
follow
once
again
another
beer
without
many
flaws
except
that
it
is
weak
light
and
watery
all
i
can
say
is
that
a
cheap
amber
lager
beats
a
cheap
pale
lager
any
day
rjt
drinkability
well
i
do
like
this
better
than
the
st
pauli
girl
lager
this
wold
be
ok
on
those
fall
afternoons
probably
wont
make
a
special
trip
for
this
beer
but
i
can
drink
it
mostly
average
to
slightly
below
average
in
my
opinion
better
than
the
regular
st
pauli
more
drinkable
but
not
better
than
average
for
something
browndark
i
poured
this
out
into
my
mass
krug
from
a
12
oz
bottle
and
hoping
to
fill
it
with
more
clear
born
on
date
of
apr
2011
this
beer
is
a
clear
medium
brown
with
a
white
head
that
lingers
smells
like
toasted
caramunich
malt
grain
and
slightly
floral
more
than
i
expected
taste
is
not
to
complex
toasted
malts
crusty
bread
and
a
medicinal
hops
with
a
grassy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
not
to
much
carbonation
is
present
it
goes
down
fast
and
is
thirst
quenching
which
is
what
a
dunkel
is
supposed
to
do
correct
to
style
i
am
going
to
go
fill
the
entire
krug
at
this
time
very
drinkable
and
very
sociable
solid
cheap
beer
d
very
good
dark
lager
i
will
definately
have
it
again
this
is
a
pretty
average
brew
all
around
i
could
see
it
being
nice
as
a
lighter
beer
with
some
heavier
taste
profiles
i
bought
this
on
special
for
3
bucks
for
a
sixpack
and
will
probably
pick
up
another
if
theres
any
left
at
my
next
visit
for
the
full
78
dollars
ive
seen
it
elsewhere
it
may
not
be
worth
it
d
very
very
drinkable
although
the
c02
was
a
bit
too
high
for
my
liking
still
a
decent
dunkel
with
a
great
price
and
drinkable
enough
to
quaff
a
six
pack
or
more
to
me
anyway
definitely
worth
a
try
id
buy
again
if
low
on
cash
cheers
d
moderately
drinkable
its
alright
wont
be
buying
again
drinks
slightly
less
well
than
average
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
buy
it
very
often
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
collar
and
skim
of
fine
beige
bubbles
coating
the
surface
of
the
beer
shortlived
spotty
lace
light
aroma
bready
malt
sulfury
hops
slight
skunk
the
bitterness
had
some
presence
but
the
malt
flavour
was
thin
and
there
was
a
metallic
quality
that
really
took
hold
at
the
back
of
the
palate
more
sulfury
hop
notes
that
were
distracting
rather
than
enjoyable
lingering
metallic
and
slightly
sweetish
flavour
light
to
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
fairly
dry
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
this
one
d
this
is
merely
an
average
beer
to
me
nothing
very
exciting
about
this
one
just
kind
of
an
averageatbest
dark
lager
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
i
suppose
the
head
could
be
described
as
off
white
or
light
tan
the
beer
has
a
slight
malty
smell
with
only
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
hops
tasted
kinda
the
way
is
smells
malty
and
a
little
hoppy
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
thin
mouthfeel
and
pretty
average
drinkability
overall
i
have
been
to
munich
and
have
tried
the
dunkel
lagers
brewed
there
are
they
are
all
far
superior
to
this
beer
dthis
is
a
typical
massmarket
german
dark
lager
theres
nothing
remarkable
about
it
its
a
decent
brew
but
thats
all
it
fits
into
the
session
beer
niche
quite
nicely
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
i
probably
wont
turn
it
down
if
offered
thin
acidic
and
too
fruity
for
a
lager
all
rush
to
my
mind
upon
just
the
first
sip
cardboardy
stale
malts
and
a
mild
sugary
sweetness
but
really
lacks
in
any
type
of
malt
depth
and
hops
are
tardy
with
only
a
bit
of
minty
cleanup
duty
on
the
finish
i
am
glad
i
got
this
as
a
single
as
a
sixpack
might
take
a
while
to
finish
not
horrible
but
i
cant
help
but
think
this
might
fare
better
in
the
euro
dark
lager
category
as
is
this
would
rate
near
the
bottom
in
terms
of
dunkels
i
have
had
the
body
was
good
for
the
style
crisp
yet
nicely
full
drinkability
was
good
easy
and
clean
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
not
a
bad
one
perhaps
a
decent
choice
when
options
are
limited
medium
body
heavily
carbonated
and
quite
filling
i
dont
find
this
beer
unenjoyable
but
definitely
would
stop
at
one
while
this
offering
is
in
no
way
offensive
its
something
youd
only
get
it
if
it
was
on
sale
theres
a
sort
of
burned
muddiness
in
the
base
flavor
and
the
hops
are
either
too
strong
or
not
strong
enough
which
makes
me
think
they
lack
soul
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
the
cheap
sovietera
polish
imports
i
drank
when
i
was
young
and
broke
mouthfeel
seemed
to
be
the
highlight
for
me
decent
amount
of
heft
and
it
just
felt
authentically
german
to
me
having
been
there
before
i
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
overall
this
beer
is
hindered
primarily
by
the
nose
and
how
the
package
fits
together
as
a
whole
d
this
brew
is
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
i
unconsciously
finished
it
in
under
three
minutes
it
really
tastes
a
lot
like
regular
st
pauli
but
with
a
hint
of
the
aforementioned
malt
characteristics
id
buy
this
for
friends
if
not
to
just
change
things
up
a
little
this
was
pretty
good
it
pours
to
a
dark
body
with
a
decent
head
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
dark
beer
though
it
has
a
bit
of
coffee
note
in
there
but
it
tastes
almost
like
regular
pauli
girl
to
me
pauli
girl
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
drank
so
just
a
bit
of
bias
haha
it
had
skunked
just
a
little
bit
but
no
worries
smooth
barley
and
malty
flavor
just
a
little
bitter
beer
slogan
you
never
forget
your
first
girl
honestly
if
i
didnt
know
anything
about
beer
styles
and
what
a
munich
dunkel
was
supposed
to
be
i
might
rate
this
beer
higher
im
just
sayin
this
is
actually
not
a
bad
beer
way
better
than
the
pilsner
a
bit
foamy
on
the
pour
nice
dark
lager
nothing
overly
offensive
some
nice
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
goes
down
rather
easily
taste
is
good
a
bit
of
brandy
like
quality
and
some
smoothness
not
a
bad
session
beer
its
hard
to
believe
ive
never
written
my
thoughts
down
about
this
accessible
this
one
appears
a
dar
cola
brown
with
ruby
highlights
forms
a
light
beige
head
that
sticks
around
for
some
time
minimal
scattered
lacing
lines
my
12
liter
mug
aroma
has
a
slight
toasted
malt
character
with
minimal
herbal
hops
accenting
the
malts
a
bit
of
a
sourdough
or
biscuit
yeast
edge
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
is
decent
a
touch
of
chocolate
mild
tartness
from
that
yeast
driven
malt
profile
herbal
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
nice
mass
produced
dunkel
it
is
what
it
is
mouthfeel
is
thin
lighter
bodied
flows
well
everybody
has
crossed
paths
with
this
beer
on
their
way
to
craftbeerdom
drinkability
is
decent
a
twelve
pack
was
on
sale
for
10
bucks
thats
a
great
deal
so
why
not
here
i
am
drinking
some
st
pauli
special
dark
drinkability
its
not
awful
but
i
dont
think
i
would
get
this
again
maybe
if
the
mood
struck
me
just
right
but
i
doubt
it
drinkability
there
arent
many
dunkels
in
town
nor
have
i
tried
that
many
but
in
my
book
this
is
tasty
enough
to
give
this
puppy
good
drinkablity
im
pleased
d
excellent
drinkability
the
mild
but
interesting
flavor
anyone
can
enjoy
and
at
4
8
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
bunch
of
this
back
to
back
also
not
bad
for
price
appearance
is
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
thin
head
smell
has
a
very
light
roasted
maltiness
with
nothing
else
really
sticking
out
taste
definately
has
the
roastiness
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
almost
a
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
good
dark
for
those
warmer
days
ruby
amber
with
a
pock
marked
sand
colored
head
that
leaves
some
splotches
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
like
any
euro
pale
lager
with
a
slightly
skunky
quality
that
fades
after
a
few
minutes
and
just
a
whiff
of
toasty
malt
not
bad
tasting
at
all
just
a
little
too
light
for
the
style
thin
mouthfeel
with
bright
carbonation
finishes
dry
an
okay
session
beer
amberbrown
in
color
smell
reminded
of
heineken
for
some
reason
the
taste
was
decent
it
had
a
very
thin
feel
and
didnt
have
any
real
standout
attractions
it
has
a
light
malty
hop
flavor
but
it
doesnt
exactly
come
out
and
grab
your
attention
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
drinkability
is
good
not
bad
overall
this
was
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
its
got
decent
color
smells
like
a
beer
has
slight
bitter
from
the
hops
but
its
very
smooth
you
could
drink
several
of
these
and
enjoy
it
i
have
before
and
probably
will
again
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
very
drinkable
beer
despite
its
flaws
its
drinkable
there
are
some
roasted
and
chocolate
flavors
here
and
the
malts
and
slight
caramel
translate
decently
to
the
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
a
little
much
but
fit
the
style
pretty
well
this
is
not
something
to
get
real
excited
about
but
okay
for
what
it
is
smells
like
a
bmc
beer
to
be
honest
nothing
in
particular
stood
out
besides
that
put
your
nose
to
it
and
then
a
bud
and
at
least
they
smelled
similar
i
am
sick
though
so
this
could
be
a
false
positive
reading
it
tasted
as
it
smelled
but
the
malt
came
through
in
the
aftertaste
which
i
wasnt
expecting
and
i
was
happy
to
see
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
very
easy
to
put
down
a
bunch
of
these
but
the
taste
doesnt
justify
it
initially
the
beer
has
a
slightly
skunky
nose
after
sitting
out
of
the
bottle
for
about
twenty
minutes
that
aroma
is
gone
and
this
becomes
a
much
better
beer
however
it
isnt
something
i
will
make
a
staple
but
i
might
have
one
once
a
year
when
i
first
took
a
drink
i
was
surprised
by
how
light
the
brew
tasted
for
a
dark
lager
there
is
not
much
thickness
in
the
taste
i
was
looking
for
something
with
a
little
more
chew
to
it
but
this
is
different
not
necessarily
bad
just
different
you
can
definitely
taste
the
malt
it
is
more
on
the
toasted
variety
and
once
again
not
as
heavy
as
many
dark
lagers
there
is
also
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
brew
maybe
from
molasses
the
aftertaste
is
dry
with
the
malt
flavors
sticking
around
after
the
last
drop
but
i
liked
her
as
a
white
girl
oh
well
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
looked
like
cocacola
with
lots
of
rising
carbonation
and
a
thin
tan
head
the
retention
was
pretty
good
but
the
lacing
left
much
to
be
desired
the
aroma
was
of
slightly
musty
malt
macro
lager
mash
and
dry
grains
the
flavors
also
were
unimpressive
it
started
with
some
toasted
malt
but
then
went
straight
to
assorted
dry
grains
similar
to
an
adjunct
lager
the
finish
was
bitter
but
a
little
askew
like
used
coffee
grains
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
rough
and
slick
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
and
the
body
medium
i
still
thought
it
better
than
the
regular
st
pauli
girl
but
not
worth
picking
up
again
d
if
there
was
nothing
else
around
that
i
like
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
not
really
a
whole
lot
going
on
tastes
like
honey
and
water
with
a
hint
of
skunk
st
pauli
girl
special
dark
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
off
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
bland
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
a
touch
grainy
with
only
a
hint
of
malt
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
either
pretty
bland
id
pass
overall
the
mouthfeel
has
carbonation
and
is
thin
to
medium
the
after
taste
is
slightly
hoppy
but
smooth
not
too
bad
but
had
better
a
bit
better
than
its
pale
counterpart
pours
a
caramel
color
with
a
big
offwhite
head
pleasantly
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
brown
bread
and
floral
hops
taste
is
similar
to
the
original
but
with
caramel
malt
flavors
added
bit
of
a
tangy
bite
when
the
beer
gets
to
the
end
not
sure
what
that
is
about
not
bad
this
beer
was
part
of
a
12
pack
freebie
that
i
received
on
thanksgiving
so
no
real
complaints
in
that
regard
i
do
love
dunkels
but
this
st
pauli
dark
did
not
live
up
such
although
is
a
decent
beer
in
a
general
way
the
pour
was
nice
but
a
little
flat
leaving
a
thin
head
with
a
soapyflower
malt
taste
with
hints
of
coffee
bitter
nuts
the
flavor
seemed
a
lowend
dunkel
or
scotch
ale
and
left
a
slightly
stale
hard
water
aftertaste
in
spite
of
these
critiques
it
was
a
decent
alternative
if
faced
with
a
macrobrew
the
taste
is
okay
and
you
better
let
this
one
sit
and
settle
for
a
bit
because
right
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
is
not
good
once
it
settles
in
it
actually
is
a
decent
euro
lager
that
still
has
that
overly
processed
macro
flavor
to
it
with
perhaps
some
adjunct
sweetner
there
is
a
bit
of
a
dark
malty
bite
to
the
beer
and
some
metallic
flavors
underneath
if
you
can
detect
it
there
is
a
pleasant
roasted
and
nutty
flavor
to
the
beer
hidden
even
deeper
underneath
but
there
is
too
much
overprocessing
of
the
beer
that
it
gets
masked
over
the
beer
overall
is
a
notch
above
mediocre
but
nothing
i
would
reach
for
in
the
future
blelow
average
but
ok
but
not
something
i
will
ever
revist
mfd
on
the
thin
side
but
not
a
bad
option
for
the
easily
sessioned
a
little
better
than
expected
in
the
world
of
massproduced
beer
its
better
than
becks
dark
pours
a
nice
clear
mahogany
with
a
decent
sized
but
not
very
persistent
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
molasses
crisp
like
a
typical
lager
aroma
flavor
is
fairly
smooth
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
subtle
undertone
of
molasses
or
caramel
texture
is
rather
smooth
and
it
does
dance
a
little
on
the
tongue
the
aroma
was
a
bit
subdued
but
had
a
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
but
not
much
more
in
drinking
it
you
got
a
slight
bitterness
to
start
then
a
soft
malt
backbone
and
with
was
fairly
dry
it
had
a
medium
body
with
a
finish
of
bitterness
overall
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
brew
finally
tried
this
i
expected
a
bit
better
dark
but
thin
colored
smell
was
like
molasses
taste
was
sweet
and
herby
though
noticably
weak
had
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
which
is
strange
with
such
a
weak
beer
a
bit
more
drinkable
then
something
that
tastes
like
this
should
be
d
again
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
have
always
prided
my
self
on
being
a
beer
geek
not
a
beer
snob
so
if
i
walk
into
a
pub
or
a
party
and
this
is
what
they
have
i
dont
mind
having
one
but
i
dont
usually
seek
it
out
to
be
perfectly
honest
this
is
an
average
dunkel
fairly
solid
in
all
categories
but
average
for
the
style
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
in
the
past
and
i
continue
to
enjoy
drinking
some
of
these
from
time
to
time
pours
very
dark
for
a
dunkel
and
produces
a
thick
foamy
head
that
ultimately
turns
to
a
thin
film
minimal
lacing
slowly
creeps
down
the
glass
and
i
am
not
able
to
determine
the
carbonation
since
i
can
not
see
through
my
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
and
bitter
i
gave
it
a
below
average
rating
only
because
the
aroma
is
very
hard
to
detect
im
forced
to
shove
my
nose
down
into
my
glass
in
order
to
pick
up
any
scent
the
flavor
is
definitely
based
on
the
original
lager
but
it
appears
to
be
altered
with
some
sweet
malts
the
combination
is
very
good
and
i
sure
do
enjoy
the
overall
taste
of
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
not
too
thin
and
the
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
all
in
all
a
well
rounded
beer
for
this
style
poured
a
dark
brown
that
light
passed
through
slightly
when
held
up
to
light
and
had
a
decent
head
that
left
minor
lacings
a
light
smell
of
hops
and
very
faint
maltiness
comprises
the
aroma
a
very
smooth
lightbodied
beer
that
has
some
mild
sweetness
as
it
tastes
a
little
like
roasted
malts
mixed
with
caramel
or
honey
or
something
thick
didnt
really
get
much
of
a
hop
presence
although
there
is
a
dryness
on
the
end
that
i
chalked
up
more
to
the
malts
than
any
hop
bite
still
an
earthy
floral
hop
presence
is
there
not
a
bad
beer
better
than
the
regular
st
pauli
not
undrinkable
but
the
metallic
notes
and
the
vagueness
of
the
dark
character
didnt
thrill
me
still
it
has
a
certain
drinkability
to
it
though
there
are
other
european
dark
lagers
i
would
easily
take
over
this
one
i
could
easily
drink
8
or
9
of
these
i
would
suggest
this
as
a
good
beginner
dunkel
to
anyone
who
curious
in
the
style
but
not
for
the
real
drinker
i
would
suggest
paying
a
dollar
more
for
warsteriners
or
becks
d
pretty
average
beer
but
still
has
some
complexity
still
better
than
most
macros
md
very
light
feel
in
the
mouth
for
a
dark
beer
and
it
didnt
support
an
bitter
or
sweet
tingles
on
the
tongue
so
it
was
very
bland
feel
the
drinkability
was
rather
harsh
because
of
the
pour
taste
and
smells
overall
a
decent
brew
definately
drinkable
in
mass
quantity
better
than
regular
st
pauli
girl
something
i
may
try
time
to
time
when
resteraunts
have
a
small
import
section
the
only
beer
that
should
come
in
a
green
bottle
is
stella
artois
i
just
dont
like
em
personal
preference
thing
i
suppose
this
beer
falls
way
short
it
has
a
nice
dark
color
and
a
decent
aroma
but
the
taste
leaves
more
to
be
desired
it
tastes
like
skunky
heineken
with
a
bit
more
roasted
maltiness
not
a
very
good
beer
drinkablity
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
that
stands
out
from
the
crowd
certainly
not
an
outstanding
dunkel
by
any
means
but
definately
adequate
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
dunkels
for
those
who
otherwise
claim
to
dislike
dark
beers
ive
turned
a
few
average
beer
drinkers
on
to
the
the
pleasures
of
darks
by
starting
them
with
this
and
working
them
onto
better
brews
while
price
should
never
be
considered
i
feel
it
would
be
unfair
not
to
make
a
note
of
it
if
you
need
a
decent
dunkel
and
dont
have
much
money
to
play
with
this
is
the
way
to
go
another
positive
is
that
you
can
pretty
much
drink
these
all
night
and
temperature
does
not
seem
to
have
a
major
impact
on
quality
ive
had
these
warm
and
ice
cold
and
it
tastes
good
in
both
cases
though
i
prefer
it
cold
this
beers
pours
a
very
dark
muddy
brown
with
a
slight
tan
head
and
very
little
lacing
left
along
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
molasses
the
taste
is
a
bit
murkythe
malt
and
grain
comes
through
but
theres
not
much
to
it
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
not
overwhelming
which
would
make
this
a
good
dark
session
beer
to
have
i
only
bought
the
st
pauli
girl
brews
today
to
review
in
the
past
ive
purchased
them
on
brew
days
if
i
was
attempting
that
particular
style
after
tonight
i
can
honestly
say
i
will
never
buy
this
companys
brews
ever
again
other
that
the
slight
plastic
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
i
have
had
dunkels
before
and
this
one
did
not
make
a
good
impression
it
was
pretty
bland
but
i
will
do
my
own
beer
shopping
from
now
on
and
stick
to
my
stouts
and
ales
st
pauli
girl
special
dark
pours
a
thin
dark
blackish
brown
there
is
no
major
head
but
a
little
foam
puddle
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
nicely
distict
of
a
german
lager
initially
the
taste
is
tart
with
a
high
caronation
feel
this
brew
burned
while
presented
too
cold
however
it
mellowed
shortley
after
getting
closer
to
room
temp
overall
it
got
a
bit
better
but
it
didnt
get
great
d
i
was
rather
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
dont
know
why
but
i
expected
more
from
it
when
its
really
just
an
average
beer
if
that
drinkability
got
a
sixer
of
these
a
few
months
ago
i
am
just
getting
around
to
finishing
them
now
it
is
a
drinkable
but
not
very
complex
brew
for
those
who
are
more
into
bmc
this
might
be
a
good
segwaydark
beer
drinkablility
try
this
on
your
friends
who
claim
to
not
like
dark
beers
one
could
pound
these
all
day
refreshing
as
they
are
with
sophisticated
however
slight
malty
nuances
made
for
the
dark
beer
lover
on
a
very
hot
beach
poured
nicely
and
looked
as
if
it
were
going
to
be
a
pretty
good
beer
but
man
was
i
wrong
the
looks
are
very
deceiving
regarding
this
beer
it
looks
tasty
smells
like
nothing
in
particular
and
tastes
like
seltzer
water
mixed
with
a
dark
beer
i
am
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
brew
i
would
buy
but
not
offensive
by
any
stretch
prosit
mk
drinkability
is
decent
the
structure
does
not
hold
together
very
well
with
a
sporadic
flavor
profile
not
very
impressive
it
pours
out
a
dark
color
with
little
head
and
smells
of
a
toasty
caramel
it
tastes
smooth
with
little
carbonation
there
is
a
taste
of
coffee
and
caramel
it
goes
down
nicely
but
overall
just
isnt
a
great
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
rush
out
to
buy
it
overall
worth
a
try
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
pretty
girl
on
the
bottle
and
thats
about
it
poured
into
a
mug
deep
almost
black
with
tan
head
smells
of
coffee
grinds
and
slightly
herbal
tastes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
some
citrus
notes
an
average
brew
but
very
acceptable
nothing
wrong
with
a
cold
one
of
these
if
there
isnt
a
lot
to
choose
from
had
this
one
at
a
pool
hall
creamy
and
rich
the
body
is
the
least
troublesome
aspect
of
the
beer
quite
good
in
this
area
however
the
sweetness
morphs
into
a
stale
grain
flavor
which
greatly
hurts
the
drinkability
this
one
is
merely
okeydokey
pours
brown
with
some
ruby
notes
and
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
maybe
some
small
notes
of
caramel
taste
is
slightly
metallic
with
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
coming
throught
mouthfeel
is
okay
nothing
special
drinkability
is
alright
but
i
would
much
rather
have
a
sam
adams
black
lager
this
beer
smells
very
sweet
and
light
the
color
is
a
very
dark
color
with
a
very
white
head
for
such
a
dark
beer
the
taste
is
very
light
with
a
very
dark
finish
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
very
little
hops
it
is
very
sweet
with
not
alot
of
bitterness
that
reminds
me
of
the
orignal
st
paulis
girl
but
with
a
heavier
malty
flavor
good
feel
in
the
mouth
and
very
drinkable
beacuse
of
how
light
it
tastes
this
is
a
dark
colored
pilsner
in
my
opiniondark
w
a
slight
white
head
hoppy
w
very
faint
malt
aroma
crisp
light
taste
the
hops
come
through
slightly
malty
just
a
faint
bit
watery
tho
with
its
light
body
dryness
i
believe
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
not
bad
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
unfortunately
ive
not
had
great
success
finding
dunkles
around
this
one
is
passable
but
not
among
the
better
examples
still
theres
nothing
terribly
wrong
with
it
and
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
the
malt
does
come
out
a
bit
as
it
warms
so
dont
drink
it
too
cold
no
need
to
session
this
unless
you
have
a
keg
of
it
and
need
to
get
rid
of
it
before
you
take
it
back
drinkability
not
as
complex
as
i
am
accustomed
too
but
would
be
an
easy
fit
for
the
common
man
looking
to
extend
his
palette
with
a
dark
euro
lager
smells
of
dark
chocolate
and
hops
pours
to
a
translucent
very
dark
brown
but
slightly
bronze
nice
micro
bubble
head
slightly
offwhite
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
semisweet
hopped
finish
carbonation
seems
high
but
doesnt
overshadow
the
bitter
finish
not
a
whole
lot
different
than
most
qualities
of
regular
st
pauli
girl
just
a
more
roasted
backgound
this
is
a
good
no
nonsense
beer
that
can
be
dranken
all
day
long
went
real
good
with
my
pot
roast
the
other
night
oh
by
the
way
check

activity
that
borders

its

but
quickly
relaxes
without
losing
its
fervor
great
choice
for
traditional
german
meals
that
incorporate
a
richer
palette
of
ingredients
and
flavors
a
quick
and
easy
choice
regarding
its
availability
and

drinkable
but
not
great
there
are
much
better
darks
out
there
to
be
had
pours
a
translucent
brown
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
red
with
a
very
palethough
not
whitehead
this
started
off
at
about
a
half
inch
and
dissipated
ti
a
thin
thin
film
quickly
maybe
12
minutes
smell
was
a
combination
of
caramel
and
mild
chocolate
with
some
hops
there
but
to
faint
to
characterize
their
smell
taste
reveals
a
bitterness
that
slides
from
hops
to
something
else
some
previous
reviewers
described
their
beers
as
skunked
but
i
might
not
go
this
far
with
this
one
to
me
this
particular
bottle
was
more
about
getting
uses
to
a
lager
after
so
may
ales
i
say
this
bc
at
root
it
had
the
sharpnessbite
that
i
associates
with
the
big
european
lagers
underneath
thisin
an
interesting
reversal
from
the
smellcomes
the
caramelchocolate
mix
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
not
close
to
a
trainwreck
of
a
beer
either
the
mouth
feel
was
actually
a
highpoint
for
me
good
thick
body
that
was
refreshing
even
despite
the
flaws
in
taste
drinkability
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
but
i
might
prefer
a
schwarzbier
like
sam
adams
black
lager
over
this
beer
good
for
partiesand
for
macroloving
friends
but
im
not
sure
this
beer
would
make
me
a
convert
to
dunkel
d
a
good
session
brew
that
leans
toward
the
dark
side
with
light
roasted
flavors
and
a
thin
drinkable
sessionable
quality
this
is
very
much
like
a
schwarsbier
and
a
good
stout
or
porter
alternative
for
those
who
like
their
coffee
weak
i
prefer
my
coffee
at
full
on
black
starbucks
strength
on
a
side
note
the
labels
came
off
clean
and
easy
with
a
little
hot
water
this
beer
is
kind
of
skunked
i
dont
give
a
shit
i
will
review
it
anyway
because
its
in
a
green
bottle
and
thats
what
happens
the
head
is
decent
on
this
beer
other
than
that
everything
else
is
subpar
doesnt
even
really
taste
like
a
dark
beer
mouthfeel
isnt
that
clingy
and
this
beer
is
hard
to
drink
due
to
a
cheap
taste
and
slight
skunkiness
dont
waste
your
money
there
are
better
beers
out
there
im
a
fan
of
munich
dunkels
this
is
the
worst
example
of
the
style
that
ive
had
are
you
sure
this
is
not
a
bmc
product
d
im
not
feeling
this
one
and
i
will
probably
never
buy
it
again
its
not
bad
but
not
what
i
expected
perhaps
i
am
suffering
from
label
bias
simply
ok
there
were
no
attributes
to
gravitate
toward
while
showing
blandness
and
a
substandard
body
the
beer
came
across
a
bit
like
charcoal
with
the
toasted
grains
little
breadiness
little
yeastiness
and
not
much
else
the
aroma
was
light
a
mimics
the
charred
flavors
finishes
a
bit
watery
and
dull
cannot
compete
with
great
german
dunkels
dfair
as
i
mentioned
before
better
than
the
original
but
still
nothing
very
exciting
or
particularly
good
just
decent
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
or
something
theres
no
carbonation
in
this
beer
at
all
and
that
makes
it
not
very
drinkable
i
think
this
could
be
a
really
good
brew
if
there
was
some
decent
carbonation
and
head
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
semisweet
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
toastey
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
dry
toastey
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
malty
with
some
metallic
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
lager
its
got
decent
malt
flavor
but
the
lager
yeast
makes
the
mouthfeel
too
metallic
tasting
and
dry
not
a
good
beer
tastes
bad
and
has
no
other
redeeming
qualities
its
like
they
poured
some
malts
into
one
of
their
already
skunked
lagers
the
flavor
is
very
light
and
dissapointing
i
expected
more
from
it
there
is
a
little
bit
of
dark
malt
flavor
and
a
hit
of
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
with
not
much
aftertaste
pours
amber
no
head
no
lacing
the
most
watery
dark
beer
i
have
ever
had
completely
unimpressed
very
metallic
with
a
hint
of
stale
cocoa
really
this
is
terrible
metallic
water
with
brown
food
coloring
i
dont
mind
their
lager
its
average
this
is
not
on
the
same
level
as
mich
ultra
amber
and
thats
not
a
good
thing
this
is
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
living
in
a
small
southern
town
with
no
micros
this
is
one
of
my
standbys
thin
head
on
pour
color
was
dark
dark
copper
looked
beautiful
when
the
light
shined
through
the
glass
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
really
good
and
this
is
a
beer
that
you
probally
shouldnt
start
drinking
unless
you
plan
to
stay
home
because
one
inst
enough
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
so
i
was
surprised
that
i
actually
found
it
to
be
pretty
decent
overall
however
it
wasnt
much
better
than
decent
an
average
beer
drinkability
not
bad
notes
not
bad
light
on
the
flavor
but
quaffable
par
for
the
dark
eurolager
course
not
bad
but
not
a
stand
out
in
any
regard
either
dark
brown
pour
with
a
small
head
that
left
minimal
lacing
first
odors
are
sligntly
skunky
followed
by
a
nose
of
dark
malts
slightly
burnt
flavor
with
a
slight
metallic
tinge
somewhat
watery
on
the
tongue
finish
is
ok
overall
a
very
average
beer
at
best
i
think
i
got
a
petty
fresh
sample
ive
had
other
st
pauli
girl
products
in
the
past
and
battled
the
skunk
twang
not
the
case
here
i
finished
this
beer
off
rather
quickly
pours
dark
brown
with
tan
head
which
fades
fast
weak
taste
of
caramel
burnt
toast
not
much
there
smell
about
the
same
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
good
but
no
body
to
it
for
a
dark
beer
feels
watered
down
drinkability
not
for
me
i
dont
think
i
would
give
another
try
for
me
i
enjoyed
this
brew
although
it
is
a
little
pricey
a
good
way
to
treat
yourself
if
you
have
a
few
extra
bucks
in
your
pocket
notesoverall
i
was
pretty
unimpressed
maybe
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
st
pauli
girl
special
dark
was
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
had
decent
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
it
smelled
lightly
of
crystal
malt
the
taste
was
light
as
well
with
sweet
malts
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
with
a
fairly
high
level
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
theres
nothing
special
going
on
here
overall
i
preferred
this
to
the
original
st
pauli
girl
easy
going
but
nothing
special
just
a
simple
dark
lager
really
overall
this
beer
is
for
the
beer
drinker
not
really
into
beer
but
looking
for
that
german
beer
with
all
honesty
this
beer
is
a
bit
nasty
and
i
would
be
just
fine
not
having
it
again
ever
bottle
taken
from
my
dads
fridge
best
before
11
2006
printed
on
the
reverse
label
eric
d
it
was
interesting
and
flavorful
enough
to
enjoy
by
itself
couldnt
imaging
having
it
with
food
would
more
than
likely
overpower
what
you
were
eating
as
noted
in
taste
the
bite
at
the
end
was
a
character
that
has
turned
me
off
this
selection
enjoyed
it
to
an
extent
while
i
had
it
drinkability
is
soso
the
body
is
light
so
it
goes
down
easy
but
the
lack
of
flavor
doesnt
drive
one
towards
another
sip
an
okay
choice
for
a
venue
dominated
by
the
bmc
clan
cheers
d
it
is
quite
drinkable
the
taste
was
a
little
sour
like
it
had
a
tinge
of
pineapple
but
not
good
pineapple
toasted
pineapple
maybe
a
touch
of
sweet
on
the
initial
drink
but
it
leaves
that
sour
aftertaste
not
that
i
couldnt
drink
it
in
fact
id
still
take
this
over
a
bud
but
i
wouldnt
ask
for
it
directly
thats
for
sure
notes
pretty
lame
by
on
every
level
only
thing
slightly
interesting
is
the
mirage
towards
the
end
that
its
going
to
finish
crisp
and
clean
only
to
pull
the
rug
out
from
under
your
palate
it
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
easy
to
drink
it
is
an
ok
brew
but
nothing
i
would
chase
down
id
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
is
looking
to
branch
out
from
yellow
and
domestic
varieties
of
beer
its
inoffensive
to
the
palate
and
is
a
good
place
to
get
a
foothold
to
ready
your
palate
for
more
interesting
and
flavorful
beers
grab
a
warsteiner
or
ayinger
or
a
leinies
red
thats
where
the
good
flavour
is
drinkability
yuck
nicht
mehr
nicht

drinkability
a
good
dark
euro
lager
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
good
example
of
it
in
my
opinion
opinion
well
i
have
drank
shiner
bock
ziegen
bock
and
now
st
pauli
girl
dark
in
the
same
night
i
guess
i
am
making
the
rounds
in
cheap
dark
beers
tonight
this
one
is
definitely
my
favorite
so
far
out
of
the
three
i
will
have
to
go
back
and
try
becks
dark
again
after
this
i
would
drink
this
beer
if
it
were
the
best
they
had
but
if
i
go
out
to
a
real
liquor
store
i
am
sticking
with
the
better
known
german
beers
like
paulaner
and
spaten
this
is
an
unremarkable
dark
lager
that
will
not
offend
but
it
wont
do
much
else
buy
this
for
your
dark
beer
fearing
friends
if
you
can
get
it
cheap
the
main
thing
i
got
out
of
this
special
dark
was
that
it
actually
tasted
like
hersheys
special
dark
chocolate
at
least
the
the
end
of
it
whatever
flavors
are
added
to
make
dark
chocolate
versus
regular
had
to
be
added
to
this
one
of
the
better
munich
dunkels
ive
tried
but
nothing
too
exceptional
this
beer
is
in
a
word
underwhelming
it
is
from
a
great
beer
maker
st
pauli
and
i
thought
it
would
be
great
what
a
letdown
dont
even
bother
picking
this
up
its
so
sad
i
really
love
what
this
brewer
has
done
and
continues
to
do
with
its
other
lines
but
this
tastes
like
a
champagne
in
that
it
is
overly
carbonated
and
has
a
so
so
aftertaste
no
head
on
the
beer
out
of
the
bottle
i
really
dont
understand
what
they
are
trying
to
do
w
this
brew
disappointing
overall
an
aboveaverage
lager
definitely
recommended
i
could
drink
these
pretty
much
any
time
but
it
isnt
a
great
beer
by
any
means
i
would
prefer
maybe
a
little
more
hop
flavor
and
more
of
a
mix
of
different
malts
tastes
like
they
stuck
to
pretty
much
one
flavor
not
a
whole
lot
to
this
beer
i
guess
this
would
be
good
for
an
amateur
im
disappointed
to
hear
something
like
this
is
coming
from
germany
not
spectacular
but
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
and
i
didnt
get
very
much

a

could
drink

personally

still

its

type

will

to

like

i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
clear
dark
brown
leaning
toward
the

stubbornly
refuses
to
generate
a
head
and
it
wont
lace

almost
like
it
was
waxed
somewhat
biscuity
aroma
mildly
malty
flavors
some
sense
of
distant
molasses
and
dark
karo
finishes
over
carbonated
and
faintly
metallic
i
didnt
detect
any
skunk
but
this
beer
is
no
where
close
to
the
quality
its
price
suggests
better
than
the
original
st
pauli
girl
but
that
isnt
really
a
big
acomplishment
in
my
opinion
got
this
at
a
wedding
recep
it
was
either
this
or
corona
light
so
i
figured
what
the
heck
dark
honey
color
with
a
medium
thick
beige
head
with
little
lacing
slight
malt
nose
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
light
malt
and
nut
flavoring
but
again
they
arent
really
pushing
the
envelope
here
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
i
never
need
to
drink
another
not
recommended
the
taste
was
okay
but
the
beers
flavor
is
not
strong
enough
to
withstand
the
effect
of
the
mild
skunking
it
was
half
dark
beer
taste
half
le
pew
sampling
two
more
of
the
six
revealed
skunking
on
those
as
well
i
still
have
2
beers
left
so
im
one
for
four
on
the
six
pack
so
far
there
should
be
a
law
about
putting
beer
in
green
glass
these
packages
sit
under
the
fluorescent
lights
of
krogers
beer
shelves
for
who
knows
how
long
i
probably
got
lucky
that
one
beer
tasted
good
so
i
can
only
give
this
one
2
5s
my
only
advice
is
avoid
the
dgbs
at
all
costs
unless
you
know
the
beer
arrived
that
day
then
buy
it
and
keep
it
in
the
dark
fridge
until
serving
time
looks
like
a
cola
both
in
terms
of
carbonation
a
spartan
head
and
color
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
and
quite
smooth
but
decidedly
unremarkable
taste
is
likewise
unremarkable
this
beers
biggest
virtue
is
its
crisp
smooth
mouthfeel
and
resulting
drinkability
pours
with
a
very
nice
head
that
lasts
quite
a
while
for
a
lager
once
the
head
fades
theres
not
much
left
to
remind
you
of
the
impressive
display
from
the
initial
pour
just
a
very
thin
ring
the
beer
is
a
nice
deep
color
reminiscent
of
a
cola
it
has
some
transparency
and
some
deep
amber
higlights
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
sweetness
very
nice
but
no
hops
are
evident
the
tase
is
smooth
with
a
good
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
there
is
also
a
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
bit
more
sweetness
is
evident
as
the
beer
warms
the
beer
sports
a
fairly
good
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
with
a
slight
creaminess
while
the
flavor
is
not
exceptional
i
think
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
with
no
complaints
the
color
is
not
too
bad
a
deep
mahogany
not
so
dark
that
you
cant
see
through
the
glass
very
little
hop
attitude
which
actually
makes
it
quite
thin
in
texture
no
real
head
to
speak
of
only
a
faint
line
around
the
top
the
flavor
however
makes
up
for
some
of
the
texture
with
a
fairly
rich
taste
the
down
side
of
that
is
a
slightly
acidic
aftertaste
maybe
its
just
me
but
the
aroma
is
what
kills
me
about
this
beer
a
faint
impression
of
ivory
soapand
no
its
not
just
my
glass
its
the
same
in
the
bottle
however
with
all
of
that
said
still
a
good
beer
with
personality
i
enjoy
this
beer
roasted
malt
taste
that
isnt
overwhelming
a
light
chocolate
and
molasses
presence
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
nice
dark
to
introduce
those
who
are
afraid
of
the
dark
this
is
a
poor
example
of
a
dark
euro
lager
needless
to
say
i
have
no
need
to
go
back
to
this
beer
and
dont
recommend
it
at
all
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
all
the
way
through
it
pours
a
dark
brownruby
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
you
wont
see
for
very
long
smelled
kind
of
funky
at
first
but
after
breathing
for
a
while
the
smell
improved
a
little
bit
damn
the
green
bottles
the
taste
could
use
a
bit
more
malty
tones
mouthfeel
is
very
watereddown
but
its
easy
to
drink
its
a
good
thing
this
beer
was
on
sale
at
the
store
i
know
i
wouldnt
buy
it
at
full
price
the
chick
on
the
bottle
has
some
nice
jugs
though
like
three
in
each
hand
of
the
liter
variety
edit
after
revisiting
this
beer
i
think
the
smell
was
more
malty
than
i
reported
and
i
think
these
were
a
little
fresher
so
i
upped
the
smell
from
3
0
to
3
5
and
the
drinkability
from
3
0
to
3
5
not
as
good
as
the
warsteiner
dunkel
but
good
this
is
a
gooddrinkable

thats
easy
on
the
taste
i
also
thought
its
alittle
thin
on
body
the
tan

are
gone
quickly
45
sec
after
pournever
to
be
seen
again
its
a
good
beer
to
have
around
if
you
want
the
kids
to
think
your
drinking
a
flat
cola
the
decent
and
well
retained
head
leaves
very
intracate
a
lace
dark
ruby
in
hue

very
clear

uh
oh

by

if
it
werent
for

and
my
bad
luck
this
wouldve
smelled
quite
nice
clean
all
around
in
flavor
but
nothing
stands
out
and
make
this
beer
particularly
memorable
the
body
is
a
bit
thin

caramel
and
slightly
toasty

are
there

i
could

have
several
pints
of
this

as
far
as
the
location
of
the
brewery
its
as
close
to
god
as
you
can
get
we
had
a
prefect
day
on
our
visit
and
could

this
would

stop
if
you
are
anywhere
near
stowe
vermont
plus
ben
jerrys
is
close
by
very
very
good
example
of
this
style
they
know
their
way
around
german
styles
this
beer
was
extremely
drinkable
there
was
no
alcohol
present
in
the
aroma
or
taste
off
tap
at
the
brewery
this
beer
was
a
rootbeer
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
the
retention
was
average
and
the
lacing
good
the
aroma
was
light
but
onpoint
i
smelled
a
mix
of
chocolate
malt
caramel
malt
some
residual
sugars
nuts
and
dark
malt
the
flavors
were
just
the
same
only
better
defined
very
nutty
and
robust
with
lots
of
caramel
some
coffee
and
a
touch
of
wood
roasted
malt
lingered
on
the
finish
rich
but
not
heavy
the
alcohol
was
wellhidden
and
generally
quite
yum
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
a
little
prickly
overall
though
very
solid
brew
here
with
a
hint
of
classic
german
character
but
has
a
bit
of
an
odd
sour
quality
that
i
cant
seem
to
ignore
its
definitely
not
compromised
or
infected
but
a
decent
beer
with
a
character
that
sort
of
distracts
me
a
solid
if
not
great
example
of
the
style
imho
disregard
the
a
s
t
m
scores
i
didnt
want
to
affect
the
overall
score
great
dunkel
in
my
opinion
not
too
pricey
for
the
delicious
taste
of
this
brew
i
am
no
pro
with
beer
tasting
but
with
dunkels
i
get
this
almost
banana
like
taste
and
this
one
delivers
in
that
respect
sugary
and
smooth
highly
recommended
by
this
nobody
body
suits
the
alcohol
content
and
overall
a
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
beer
o
if
i
had
to
drink
one
style
of
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
think
it
would
be
munich
dunkels
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
get
it
drink
it
share
it
prost
o
the
germans
have
session
beers
down
pat
packing
much
flavor
and
great
body
into
an
easily
drinkable
beer
the
dunkel
has
the
richness
of
a
much
bolder
style
as
well
the
taste
begins
with
a
full
toffeecaramel
malt
note
followed
by
a
a
slightly
biting
bitter
finale
but
overall
it
is
a
balanced
drinkable
beer
theres
a
bit
of
prefermented
malt
flavor
as
wellsweet
malted
sugar
some
darker
bread
tastes
no
notable
hop
below
average
body
with
a
reasonable
level
of
carbonation
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
fairly
high
levels
of
carbonation
this
leads
to
a
mouthfeel
that
is
marginally
prickly
quickly
becoming
moderately
light
foamy
and
smooth
across
the
palate
closes
in
a
surprisingly
dry
fashion
with
very
modest
stickiness
across

balance
taste
of
caramel
toffee
toast
biscuit
nuttiness
molasses
raisin
light
chocolate
and
light
herbal
spiciness
lingering
notes
of
caramel
toffee
nuttiness
toast
light
chocolate
and
biscuit
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
robust
flavors
with
great
balance
and
very
clean
no
cloying
sweetness
at
all
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
and
very
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
pretty
much
no
warming
noticed
at
all
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
dunkel
lager
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
flavor
and
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
well
done
very
drinkable
lager
beer
just
what
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
o
goes
down
easy
somewhat
tasty
not
too
filling
not
much
of
a
kick
ok
representation
of
style
save
for
the
metallic
presence
this
would
be
a
pretty
quaffable
beer
overall
a
decent
enough
dunkel
though
i
have
had
better
still
it
is
hard
to
know
how
fresh
this
might
be
decent
dunkel
a
bit
on
the
heavier
side
o
blew
me
away
one
of
the
best
funnels
ive
had
in
some
time
im
a
sucker
for
roasted
tastes
and
biting
carbonation
and
this
shot
right
for
it
a
good
session
beer
that
one
could
have
three
plus
of
when
i
poured
the
kloster
dunkel
from
the
bottle
into
my
aventinus
weizenbock
glass
it
poured
a
clear
light
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
there
was
a
slight
head
that
quickly
dissipated
with
a
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
i
took
a
good
sniff
and
smelled
roasted
malts
and
some
burnt
chocolate
when
i
took
that
first
mouthful
the
taste
was
pretty
much
like
it
smelled
roasted
malts
a
little
bready
with
a
burnt
chocolate
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
feel
a
little
thinner
than
some
of
the
dunkels
but
not
light
on
taste
not
an
abundance
of
carbonation
also
there
isnt
a
hint
of
alcohol
this
dunkel
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
dunkel
i
could
have
drank
a
bunch
of
these
for
sure
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
a
sweeter
taste
i
highly
recommend
this
if
you
havent
had
it
by
now
taste
is
a
very
good
solid
dunkel
caramelized
toasted
barley
gingerbread
woody
spice
it
is
lively
and
engaging
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
excellent
with
good
wellrounded
character
overall
this
was
an
ok
dunkel
that
i
didnt
mind
but
didnt
go
crazy
over
as
far
as
dunkels
go
this
one
was
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
spectrum
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
thicker
and
flavorful
but
the
lightness
makes
it
a
refreshing
easy
drinker
and
good
selection
for
a
hot
afternoon
for
4
a
bottle
i
dont
think
i
will
be
revisiting
it
but
if
i
just
have
to
have
a
light
dunkel
i
might
be
inclined
to
buy
this
but
it
would
help
if
it
was
a
dollar
cheaper
if
you
want
a
lighter
dunkel
give
it
a
try
but
it
isnt
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
find
it
not
the
ultimate
dunkel
i
was
searching
for
the
search
continues
pours
very
dark
brown
colalike
color
with
a
little
white
foam
that
vanishes
no
trace
left
behind
maple
syrup
like
smell
mixed
with
maltiness
sweet
taste
is
a
faint
malt
nonexistent
carbonation
feels
very
flat
watery
mouthfeel
like
i
was
drinking
the
wort
not
the
beer
meh
easy
drinker
here
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
very
worth
trying
a
bit
light
in
intensity
but
this
is
still
one
more
example
of
what
is
turning
into
one
of
my
favorite
styles
to
drink
year
round
pours
chestnut
brown
wihout
much
of
a
head
at
all
a
good
swirl
doesnt
do
much
to
rouse
anythig
up
nose
is
muted
with
hints
of
light
caramel
and
not
much
else
taste
is
much
better
good
dose
of
caramel
raisins
toffee
dark
fruits
and
light
yeast
feel
is
light
to
medium
and
is
quite
smooth
drinks
quite
well
amyliz4
stole
a
good
portion
of
my
glass
hopefully
this
is
on
tap
around
here
again
the
palate
is
just
wonderful
rather
rich
with
a
blend
of
toasted
bread
caramel
and
a
little
burnt
sugar
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
this
is
rather
grainy
but
in
a
way
that
makes
me
think
of
brown
rice
if
that
makes
any
sense
with
delicate
flavor
but
very
clean
and
not
particularly
husky
like
wheat
can
be
despite
the
sweet
flavors
this
is
really
light
on
the
palate
and
dries
up
on
the
finish
with
crisp
carbonation
a
little
burnt
sugar
and
some
toast
hops
arent
really
noticeable
but
that
might
be
because
of
age
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
and
is
pretty
much
perfect
for
this
beer
very
drinkable
this
is
one
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
and
i
plan
to
revisit
it
soon
to
see
if
different
glassware
improves
the
appearance
and
aroma
md
this
is
a
rather
fullbodied
dunkel
flavors
are
rich
and
remain
on
the
palate
for
some
time
very
smooth
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
good
thing
its
priced
where
it
is
because
this
in
quantity
could
get
quite
expensive
a
very
sessionable
brew
indeed
drinkability
a
very
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
like
today
theres
a
good
flavor
and
its
definitely
a
sessionable
brew
d
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
consume
yeah
like
a
light
dunkel
not
really
exciting
and
i
like
this
style
but
in
the
overall
picture
it
is
decent
good
solid
dunkel
poured
with
a
small
to
medium
tan
head
that
quickly
subsides
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
copper
red
aroma
is
roasty
and
very
malty
flavor
is
like
aroma
and
very
sweet
up
front
then
a
heavier
slightly
roasty
bitter
finish
good
full
rounded
body
and
carbonation
session
beer
d
decent
representative
of
the
style
if
you
like
this
it
is
very
drinkable
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
while
pouring
it
it
looked
like
cola
when
finished
pouring
it
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
it
had
a
creamy
amber
brown
color
to
it
theres
a
pretty
bubbly
head
with
lots
of
different
sized
bubbles
that
goes
away
pretty
quickly
not
much
lacing
a
few
little
blotches
randomly
stick
to
the
glass
not
much
of
an
aroma
to
the
smell
it
smells
very
sweet
caramelized
malts
seems
too
weak
of
an
argument
id
go
with
caramel
soaked
or
topped
the
taste
is
pretty
good
again
its
pretty
sweet
caramelized
malts
take
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
with
some
toffee
notes
theres
also
a
hint
of
nuts
to
it
candied
though
with
the
slightest
taste
of
alcohol
slight
hop
on
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
very
clean
with
decent
drinkability
d
meh
the
flavor
is
quite
spicy
as
well
with
a
nice
cove
presence
as
well
as
some
ripe
banana
notes
smokey
caramel
malt
and
a
subtle
bitterness
in
the
finish
slightly
watered
down
but
still
pretty
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
me
the
thick
body
impedes
the
easy
quaffing
normally
associated
with
a
low
abv
beer
like
this
but
it
didnt
bother
me
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
medium
brownamber
with
a
small
whitish
head
sweet
malt
aroma
hint
of
chocolate
crisp
roasted
flavors
nutty
and
slightly
sweet
midpalate
lacks
much
depth
of
toasted
malt
and
finishes
a
bit
thin
with
some
mineral
qualities
not
a
bad
quaffer
or
food
beer
but
seems
a
little
deflated
i
suspect
the
bottle
isnt
the
freshest
d
the
drinkability
isnt
so
bad
the
astringency
doesnt
overpower
theres
no
bestby
date
on
the
bottle
so
im
questionable
about
the
freshness
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
yeast
and
slight
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
dunkel
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
yeast
slight
hop
and
some
roasted
malt
overall
a
decent
beer
better
than
most
update
november
2010
i
had
a
bad
batch
when
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
the
beer
is
plenty
carbonated
not
flat
at
all
the
beer
is
a
touch
watery
but
has
sufficient
lagery
caramel
flavors
to
make
it
a
decent
choice
im
upgrading
the
points
on
this
beer
nice
drinkable
beer
especially
if
you
like
a
little
bock
in
it
not
all
that
remarkable
this
one
gets
lost
amongst
all
the
others
like
it
from
germany
d
great
nose
solid
taste
in
the
end
a
nice
effort
it
needs
more
sweetness
to
be
really
good
it
definitely
has
potential
d
definitely
seems
to
bloat
the
stomach
so
its
hard
to
down
a
lot
or
drink
a
lot
fast
this
tastes
wonderful
for
about
5
seconds
per
sip
its
greatness
is
fleeting
i
tried
to
hold
each
sip
in
my
mouth
as
long
as
possible
it
worked
well
enough
that
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
it
certainly
has
its
charm
but
not
sure
id
return
ettalers
doppelbock
curator
is
way
better
one
of
the
worlds
best
in
my
opinion
d
for
a
supersession
a
lack
of
power
and
lingering
finish
can
actually
be
a
good
thing
sadly
i
only
have
one
of
these
and
when
i
only
drink
one
beer
id
prefer
that
it
be
a
little
more
interesting
actually
due
to
its
very
mellow
and
light
flavor
profile
almost
like
newcastle
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
to
give
to
a
bmc
fellow
who
thinks
that
all
dark
beers
are
a
meal
in
a
bottle
very
easy
to
drink
this
one
does
nothing
wrong
but
its
just
easy
going
and
pretty
tasty
this
would
be
a
great
choice
for
people
who
like
the
belgium
style
or
dopplebocks
paid
about
3
bucks
for
a
bottle
at
magnolia
here
in
lynchburg
va
it
is
almost
worth
it
almost
i
do
like
the
big
bottle
so
maybe
i
got
a
little
more
beer
but
i
still
dont
think
i
quite
got
my
moneys
worth
unless
i
got
a
bad
bottle
dthis
is
where
the
beer
really
shines
a
true
session
beer
was
kinda
disappointed
with
this
beer
doubtful
ill
be
back
for
this
one
but
im
not
giving
up
on
the
style
aftertaste
very
long
wih
again
burnt
coal
coffee
this
brew
is
a
little
bit
more
than
light
in
body
but
quite
thirst
quenching
this
wasnt
too
bad
and
is
an
added
incentive
to
visit
the
ettaler
monastery
i
was
told
by
another
group
of
beer
geeks
to
look
out
for
sediment
in
ettaler
beers
if
you
see
floaties
youve
gotten
yourself
a
bad
bottle
nutty
brown
amber
color
and
very
clear
with
an
offwhite
head
almost
nothing
on
the
nose
a
faint
whiff
of
caramel
and
metal
uh
oh
is
it
stale
is
it
oxidized
is
it
old
it
doesnt
taste
old
or
stale
but
it
is
slightly
oxidized
there
is
a
faint
nutty
caramel
character
that
is
nothing
that
shiner
bock
couldnt
achieve
with
a
little
effort
but
the
stand
out
is
the
smooth
clean
roundness
that
is
mostly
reserved
for
german
and
czech
lagers
pretty
drinkable
due
to
the
lack
od
serious
flavor
but
the
body
is
there
medium
to
full
body
finishes
with
that
same
distant
nutty
caramel
flavor
pours
dark
brown
big
head
medium
duration
nose
is
malty
sweet
taste
is
toasted
malt
sweet
big
bready
character
medium
body
highly
carbonated
almost
effervescent
finish
is
sweet
malty
no
detectable
bitterness
could
drink
this
one
all
night
d
this
one
is
very
drinkable
there
is
no
nothing
overwhelming
that
forces
you
to
sip
it
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
than
what
was
delivered
in
the
flavor
too
one
dimensional
it
does
have
a
great
creamy
mouthfeel
even
with
a
lively
carbonation
feels
medium
body
and
goes
down
easily
and
the
abv
wont
sneak
up
on
you
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
revisit
d
drinkability
is
therefore
limited
to
and
hindered
by
its
sweetness
dark
brownamber
color
with
1
finger
tan
head
and
moderate
head
and
lacing
nice
smell
with
complex
notes
to
it
of
fig
and
plum
and
roasted
chocolate
roasted
coffee
with
a
chocolate
finish
well
balance
of
smooth
malt
with
a
hop
tickle
smooth
mediumfull
body
that
retains
throughout
very
drinkable
for
a
dark
great
smooth
creamy
texture
totally
drinkable
the
mouth
is
silky
smooth
with
a
nice
low
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
this
one
and
for
me
this
can
be
a
long
session
beer
enjoyable
and
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
drinkability
is
good
easy
drinking
not
complex
at
all
no
master
piece
and
probably
wouldnt
repurchase
but
not
a
bad
little
beer
drink
easy
not
as
good
as
at
the
source
but
worth
seeking
out
imo
this
is
the
best
offering
from
this
scenic
kloster
brewery
sitting
outside
of
a
german
pub
in
the
middle
of
ettal
nice
warm
day
the
girls
were
shopping
so
my
dad
and
i
sat
down
to
have
a
beer
i
had
never
heard
of
ettaler
until
i
got
to
the
town
this
beer
had
a
huge
white
head
on
it
german
pour
brown
color
was
typical
aroma
was
lacking
this
one
needs
to
hit
the
mouth
very
malty
carmel
backbone
easy
to
drink
and
nice
on
a
warm
afternoon
not
to
mention
the
feeling
you
get
drinking
a
local
german
brew
in
southern
bavaria
very
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
hint
of
metallic
in
the
finish
fairly
balanced
between
sweet
and
dry
easy
to
drink
id
probably
pick
a
brown
ale
over
this
most
days
but
it
is
a
decent
change
up
taste
is
sweet
and
roasted
molasses
with
a
light
maltbitter
there
is
no
real
hop
bitterness
or
hop
aroma
present
the
malt
is
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
than
in
the
smell
there
is
very
little
carbonation
in
the
beer
which
interfere
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
it
doesnt
seem
right
no
this
was
a
fine
beer
and
i
could
tell
theres
a
slightly
richer
complexity
to
it
that
i
just
was
not
in
the
best
state
to
appreciate
dhell
of
a
session
beer
great
nose
nicely
flavored
body
is
about
right
for
the
style
this
is
a
dandy
notes
this
is
the
best
munich
dunkel
ive
had
to
date
i
simply
couldnt
find
one
thing
to
harp
on
try
as
i
might
brown
body
with
rubyred
highlights
and
about
a
half
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
malt
caramel
and
brown
sugar
mostly
tastes
sweet
and
malty
roasty
like
brown
sugar
and
molasses
medium
in
body
rather
drinkable
a
really
tasty
decent
little
beer
md
full
of
body
yet
extremely
clean
on
the
mouthfeel
while
the
carbonation
remains
soft
and
soothing
without
being
intrusive
for
this
style
i
think
ive
finally
found
something
that
impresses
me
big
time
wellbalanced
and
wellstructured
bw
a
quiet
but
significant
input
of
hops
and
moderate
entry
of
dark
malts
while
the
body
and
flavour
both
are
retained
from
the
beginning
to
the
last
drop
a
really
cool
and
enjoyable
dunkel
this
is
all
thanks
to
my
lovely
german
flatmates
kindest
offer
beer
poured
into
tumbler
at
50
degrees
this
beer
was
a
good
beer
it
had
fair
head
though
went
awayy
quick
it
was
a
pretty
dark
brown
and
tasted
slightly
of
roasted
something
but
it
just
did
not
stand
out
greatly
while
i
liked
it
okay
i
will
still
have
to
say
that
i
will
not
purchase
gain
dark
clear
caramel
color
with
an
ok
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
coating
but
with
big
lacing
has
some
toasted
malt
notes
and
a
little
cherry
int
he
nose
but
not
much
else
taste
starts
with
a
light
mollasses
takes
a
left
turn
towards
a
metallic
hop
monster
but
stops
short
of
overbearing
then
finishes
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
slight
maltmetallic
aftertaste
lovely
mouthfeel
i
spotted
this
in
my
local
store
brawleys
and
gave
it
a
whirl
it
poured
with
a
little
head
showing
that
it
wasnt
overly
carbonated
the
aroma
immediately
gave
me
hints
of
chocolate
some
toasting
and
a
little
floral
tones
it
had
a
great
malty
taste
right
away
on
the
palate
a
little
nutty
and
with
a
nice
chocolate
finish
in
the
aftertaste
you
get
some
of
the
hops
but
a
good
continuing
malty
flavor
so
smooth
when
in
germany
i
had
the
pleasure
of
going
to
kloister
andechs
that
was
probably
my
favorite
dunkel
of
all
but
this
ettaler
stacks
up
nicely
if
you
find
it
definitely
pick
one
or
ten
of
them
up
thanks
go
to

for

the

for
me

into

a
pint
for
the
style
this
is
probably
the
most
enjoyable
ive
had
easy
to
drink
and
definitive
for
the
style
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
typical
for
the
style
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
awful
as
i
poured
i
thought
something
must
have
gone
bad
in
my
kitchen
but
a
stale
malt
flavor
was
rising
from
the
glass
the
flavor
reminded
me
most
of
rancid
raisins
the
date
on
the
bottle
was

not
sure
if
that
is
a
drink
by
or
a
made
on
date
i
will
try
rereviewing
this
in
the
future
as
i
may
have
had
a
bad
bottle
but
i
doubt
it
one
of
only
two
or
three
beers
i
have
ever
dumped
taste
very
malty
with
caramel
chocolate
and
bread
dough
the
raisins
and
nutty
flavors
came
through
but
were
not
very
strong
there
was
almost
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
and
the
finish
was
on
the
sweet
side
while
this
wasnt
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
drink
mouthfeel
was

i
had
never
expected
to
see
it
again
after
my
visit
to

i

i

very

tasting
like
the

honeycake
though
the
mouthfeel
isnt
thick

at

no
thicker
than
it
should
be
some
caramel

in
there
as
well
the
range
is
narrow
but
the
beer
is
very
tasty
an
aggressive
pour
in
my

resulted
in
a

faded
into
a

that
left
nice

pine

on
the

dry

with

really
pretty

pretty

this

this
is
an
excellent
beer
for
the

although
admittedly
i
need
to
seek
out
and
try
more
for
comparison
i
hope
they
are
all
this

never

it
before

im

im
looking

i
have

i
have

almost
fantasylike

of
having

in

this
makes
them
very
believable
a
very
solid
beer
munich
malts
make
the
bread
tones
evident
and
the
extra
darker
toasty
nuttyness
gives
it
an
almost

character
quite
a
nice
treat
spendy
though
ettaler
kolster
dunkel
is
good
beer
if
given
a
chance
its
the
antithesis
of
big
beer
but
calling
it
little
beer
is
an
undeserved
slight
there
cant
be
too
many
versions
out
there
that
are
superior
to
this
one
poured
out
to
more
of
a

than
a

a

moments
minor
lacing
around
the
glass
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
well
not
much
traces
of
sweet
malt
and
light
hops
were
noted
woulda
been
a
helluva
lot
better
if
i
didnt
have
to
struggle
to
get
some
type
of
smell
flavor
was
a
nice
pickup
point
area
for
this
brew
notes
of
unsweet
caramel
medium
malt
and
some
smokelike
spice
was
also
noted
toward
the
finish
albeit
weak
nice
mouthfeel
very
crisp
and
refreshing
this
could
be
a
nice
place
to
start
for
those
looking
for
a
gateway
into
german
dark
beers
recommended
drinkability

this
was
an
enjoyable
and
credible
example
of
the
mdl
style
i
actually
had
this
on
tap
a
few
nights
ago
and
now
i
am
enjoying
the
bottle
version
ill
have
to
add
the
tap
version
at
some
point
nice
chocolate
color
the
12
inch
head
left
pretty
quick
i
am
picking
up
some
rich
malt
actually
almost
a
low
vinous
and
pleasant
note
in
there
as
well
drinking
this
is
like
eating
a
hearty
dark
bread
although
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
rather
light
the
carbonation
is
also
rather
modest
nice
hint
of
milk
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
highly
highly
recommended
on
draft
im
left
with
a
clean
mouth
yummy
but
not
my
favorite
style
a
noble
effort
though
and
should
be
recognized
as
such
it
finishes
dry
with
a
flash
of
toffee
thats
followed
by
a
note
of
mild
bitter
dark
chocolate
raspy
grassy
hops
and
a
longlingering
dull
bitterness
mouthfeel
features
a
creamy
medium
body
with
a
mellow
carbonation
that
makes
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
the
bottle
is
almost
empty
and
i
could
easily
drink
another
not
an
incredible
brew
but
tasty
refreshing
and
drinkable
worth
a
try
delicious
just
like
i
love
my
coffee
black
and
strong
overall
an
interesting
dark
beer
that
drinks
like
a
lager
unconventionally
enjoyable
zero
hop
notes
alcohol
unnoticeable
all
in
all
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
seasonal
over
all
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
karbach
lineup
very
drinkable
cold
weather
lager
this
is
a
seasonal
brew
that
we
all
here
in
houston
cannot
wait
for
wonderful
flavor
and
strangely
i
find
its
flavor
is
more
pronounced
from
the
can
there
is
nothing
like
the
sound
of
the
crack
to
inspire
an
inverted
glug
and
thus
we
were
off
and
running
i
always
get
a
kick
out
of
the
ensuing
pseudocascade
especially
in
the
darker
beers
and
this
was
no
exception
after
settling
i
had
just
over
two
fingers
of
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deeprubygarnet
srm
27

with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
of
milk
chocolate
and
bread
or
biscuits
which
was
nice
without
being
cloying
or
overdone
i
began
to
see
some
nice
lacing
form
as
the
head
fell
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
unexpectedly
more
bitter
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
think
i
really
liked
this
as
a
result
think
about
it
a
canned
lager
from
a
microbrewery
which
is
unusual
in
and
of
itself
but
then
one
that
did
not
evince
the
usual
sweetness
of
the
style
sure
it
had
a
chocolatecocoa
sweetish
flavor
from
the
malt
but
it
was
downplayed
by
the
grassiness
of
the
hops
making
it
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
finish
was
semisweet
and
really
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
of
late
i
had
this
beer
at
the
flying
saucer
in
houston
this
was
my
first
karbach
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
very
good
with
a
rich
dark
smooth
ride
i
have
looked
for
this
beer
at
other
places
but
it
must
be
seasonal
i
will
try
and
get
in
a
keg
for
my
kegerator
when
it
comes
back
out
later
this
year
body
is
creamy
and
smooth
medium
but
superdrinkable
definitely
a
tasty
one
from
karbach
smooth
and
tasty
pretty
pleased
with
buying
this
stuff
just
wish
i
had
bought
more
another
good
beer
from
karbach
and
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
a
very
enjoyable
lager
like
most
karach
this
does
not
have
a
real
defined
style
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
dunkle
lager
and
swartz
i
am
sure
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
on
occasion
with
no
problem
my
daughter
bought
these
for
him
and
told
me
she
loves
the
names
that
karbach
chooses
for
its
brews
poured

glass
very
dark
blackdark
red

very
clear
color
of
the
can
is
very
close
to
the
color
of
the
beer
smells
less
than
it
tastes
chocolate
and
very
roasted
malt
notes
very
nice
soft
mouthfeel
tastes
more
sophisticated
than
it
smells
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
very
well
blended
flavors
that
are
nicely
balanced
with
some
faint
hops
in
the
background
the
hops
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
i
must
admit
i
tend
to
discriminate
against
cans
because
in
the
past
i
could
taste
metal
and
hate
that
i
do
not
taste
any
metal
in
this
beer
even
thought
its
canned
afterglass
reveals
the
hops
a
very
nice
colderweather
seasonal
more
proof
that
a
lager
can
pack
plenty
of
taste
and
a
perfect
coolerweather
brew
hmmmm
mild
chocolate
and
bigger
roast
the
malts
just
dont
really
smooth
out
the
way
a
good
dunkel
does
pretty
much
a
letdown
for
karbach
after
many
a
good
canned
seasonal
and
this
coming
from
a
huge
dunkel
fan
mouthfeel
is
actually
a
high
point
despite
the
roast
carbonation
is
finebubbled
its
not
horrible
but
with
some
of
the
recent
successes
from
karbach
and
my
love
for
the
dunkel
style
i
was
hoping
for
something

an

and
pas
ive
had
in
the
last
few
weeks
love
varying
the
style
this
one
aint
a
bad
example
either
this
is
one
of
the
better
dunkel
beers
ive
had
though
so
dont
be
put
off
by
my
complaint
about
the
body
depth
pours
a
pretty
copperamber
in
color
with
a
1finger
off
white
head
some
sticky
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
dark
bready
malt
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
just
a
slight
hoppy
finish
very
light
though
and
not
bad
at
all
actually
overall
a
good
dark
brew
o
its
got
lots
of
sweet
malt
notes
especially
in
the
nose
but
overall
its
underwhelming
better
dunkels
surely
exist
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
i
am
no
expert
but
i
do
appreciate
premium
lagers
this
dunkel
is
up
there
in
the
outstanding
category
to
me
it
does
lack
a
bit
in
the
area
of
bitterness
and
could
use
more
of
the
burnt
flavor
a
good
beer
and
i
do
like
drinking
and
serving
it
this
was
my
after
tour
sample
at
the
brewery
in
flensburg
home
of
the
plop
it
is
a
wonderful
dark
beer
with
a
wonderful
nutty
aroma
and
nice
dark
malt
taste
it
has
a
nice
creamy
head
and
goes
well
with
the
bread
meat
fish
and
cheese
they
served
with
it
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
as
it
did
not
seem
to
have
the
bitterness
of
most
dark
beers
that
pour
almost
black
a
nice
balance
of
malt
to
hops
all
in
all
a
really
nice
beer
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
hue
giant
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
a
really
solid
combination
of
sweet
components
on
a
roasted
malt
bed
flavor
is
light
roasted
malt
with
a
little
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
no
complaints
here
with
this
brew
one
high
tech
package
with
the
bottle
but
form
a
beer
drinkers
perspective
it
certainly
lives
up
to
a
premium
beers
reputation
mild
yet
tasty
which
is
why
people
drink
beverages
for
the
taste
and
this
brew
did
itself
justice
in
that
category
o
i
had
quite
high
hopes
for
this
but
it
was
really
quite
disappointing
very
easy
to
drink
and
if
it
were
on
tap
i
could
quite
happily
session
it
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
didnt
like
much
the
taste
of
raw
malt
on
it
but
has
its
own
character
this
one
was
a
nice
deep
copper
color
topped
off
with
a
thick
tan
head
very
fluffy
and
stuck
around
for
a
bit
theres
some
great
lacing
too
the
body
itself
is
clear
with
medium
carbonation
mild
hop
flavors
are
the
first
thing
you
taste
strong
grass
flavors
come
into
play
and
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
a
copy
of
the
flavors
wheat
grass
hops
and
a
mild
sweet
smell
all
mixed
into
one
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
overall
and
its
light
bodied
plus
its
goes
down
pretty
smooth
mouth
feel
aroma
and
appearance
were
fine
it
was
just
lacking
in
taste
quite
frankly
o
a
nice
dark
lager
with
the
sweetness
held
back
i
have
to
say
i
was
always
wondered
about
the
little
beers
i
would
see
all
over
but
never
got
around
to
trying
the
until
recently
when
a
german
friend
bought
me
a
sample
pack
dont
let
the
look
of
these
little
beers
fool
you
and
the
fact
i
usually
see
it
in
gas
and
train
stations
it
is
actually
really
decent
beer
the
dunkel
was
very
weak
in
most
characteristic
to
this
style
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
were
very
mild
in
the
roasted
qualities
that
i
think
a
dunkel
should
have
there
was
some
roastiness
but
just
very
faint
the
feel
was
a
little
thin
but
not
bad
and
it
was
definitely
easy
to
drink
there
was
a
great
malt
flavor
however
even
though
not
roasted
and
a
mild
hop
flavor
i
bought
it
because
of
the
cool
bottle
but
i
definitely
wasnt
impressed
with
the
beer
it
tastes
like
a
watered
down
heineken
dark
skunky
flavor
little
mouthfeel
no
malt
no
hops
just
blah
maybe
this
one
sat
on
the
shelf
too
long
but
i
wont
buy
this
again
pretty
lean
and
light
for
the
style
nothing
in
the
way
of
fruit
to
ease
up
the
toasted
grain
but
still
pleasant
like
most
flensburger
beers
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
what
it
lacks
in
depth
and
adherence
to
style
a
very
nice
munchen
lager
sessionable
very
interesting
when
paired
with
yellow
cheese
i
would
buy
it
again
for
sure
as
far
as
the
dunkel
world
goes
this
beer
certainly
is
on
the
lager
end
so
no
confusion
there
it
has
that
character
that
is
almost
always
in
lagers
due
to
there
yeast
and
then
it
has
some
of
the
darker
malt
and
sweeter
side
that
the
dunkel
truck
delivers
overall
a
decent
dunkel
for
sure
though
it
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
a
quite
decent
malt
bomb
o
easy
drinker
but
could
us
a
bit
more
character
still
a
nice
dunkel
swing
top
bottles
are
fantastic
the
beer
is
brown
with
at
thin
head
the
smell
is
clove
alcohol
and
gingerbread
the
taste
is
more
savory
than
some
dunkels
with
some
prune
chocolate
seem
like
it
has
more
alcohol
than
4
8
perhaps
a
bit
overpriced
good
but
spaten
is
better
and
less
expensive
buy
the
hefe
if
you
need
the
bottles
hits
the
spot
a
serious
good
beer
satisfying
good
beer
feels
a
little
flat
some
more
body
and
carbonation
could
have
made
this
one
a
good
sessioner
but
it
goes
down
too
fast
the
taste
is
an
interesting
combination
of
the
warm
maltiness
typical
for
the
dunkelstyle
and
the
fresh
hoppiness
of
northern
german
lagers
which
surprisingly
results
in
a
kind
of
british
elegance
in
the
end
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
pours
a
medium
amber
with
off
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
nose
is
a
little
toasty
but
not
much
else
palate
was
surprisingly
light
with
a
rather
thin
body
some
toasty
malt
flavors
that
have
just
a
suggestion
of
roastiness
and
a
modicum
of
hop
influence
thrown
in
there
finishes
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
appetizing
with
interesting
flavors
to
crave
on
the
next
sip
boring
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
but
also
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
again
the
taste
is
for
sure
a
winner
it
is
nowhere
near
the
top
of
the
sweetness
threshold
for
this
style
it
has
a
surprising
hop
bite
the
malts
are
nice
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
an
ever
so
slight
roastiness
it
is
smooth
and
refreshing
my
favorite
beer
style
of
summer
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
toasted
crackers
the
malt
is
delicious
and
slightly
sweet
very
faint
hallertauerlike
hop
character
the
beer
is
fairly
lightbodied
with
a
gainly
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
better
than
average
sister
brought
this
back
from
a
recent
trip
to
germany
poured
copperchestnut
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
and
great
lacing
very
carbonated
crisp
noble
hops
aroma
and
some
biscuit
not
much
else
initially
very
caramelmalty
in
the
flavor
then
a
pronounced
bitterness
midpalate
dissolving
to
a
big
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
carbonated
and
very
thin
sessionable
but
much
more
bitter
than
i
expected
this
to
be
a
very
thin
feeling
dunkel
with
a
toastiness
and
bake
apple
malt
quality
the
malt
doesnt
give
it
much
body
though
its
a
lean
feel
of
a
beer
with
a
bitter
end
of
smokiness
palate
is
not
bad
and
has
all
the
quintessential
parts
for
its
style
but
lack
in
feel
nice
molasses
nose
it
has
room
for
improvement
although
the
span
of
the
flavor
is
quite
wide
for
something
this
light
in
body
i
really
respect
that
it
made
it
quite
drinkable
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
worth
a
shot
but
nothing
too
exciting
here
this
shows
a
light
copper
color
with
a
fair
white
cover
that
disappears
to
a
ring
quickly
with
marginal
lacing
the
aroma
says
malty
licorice
and
root
beer
with
some
earthy
pear
sweetness
quite
interesting
the
flavor
offers
more
earthiness
malt
and
chocolate
licorice
with
some
leafy
hop
bitterness
theres
a
tart
molasses
idea
fine
subtle
carbonation
that
makes
a
reasonably
drinkable
brew
full
of
malt
flavors
an
interesting
lightmedium
bodied
brew
with
a
crisp
feel
i
like
it
fine
and
would
revisit
any
time
this
beer
is
like
a
darker
version
of
a
pilsner
maybe
crossed
with
a
bock
lets
just
say
its
pretty
drinkable
not
my
first
choice
at
a
store
but
this
is
probably
the
best
you
can
get
for
the
price
i
think
it
was
around
1
30
for
a
single
d
oh
yeah
go
for
it
poured
into
pint
glass
it
showed
dark
copper
with
a
head
that
lingered
for
only
a
moment
smells
malty
and
slightly
spicy
taste
is
a
little
watery
and
has
a
slightly
coppery
aftertaste
i
was
disappointed
and
it
reminds
me
of
every
other
dark
german
beer
you
can
find
in
a
wellstocked
supermarket
i
could
still
drink
this
all
day
long
watching
football
and
eating
standard
bar
food
not
great
but
better
than
budweiser
d
excellent
flensburger
in
my
opiinion
deserves
the
same
rating
as
its
sister
flensburger
pilsener
beer
is
really
sweet
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
i
am
picking
up
some
alcohol
as
well
body
is
medium
but
the
beer
overall
is
a
little
hard
to
drink
not
feeling
this
one
overall
i
liked
it
although
i
had
expected
a
little
bit
more
complexity
nice
beer
got
this
bottle
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
at
surdyks
in
minneapolis
opened
with
a
rousing
pop
and
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
tan
head
and
some
lace
head
mostly
settled
down
soon
color
is
clear
dark
amber
brown
with
some
dark
red
orange
highlights
aroma
was
dark
malt
cocoa
earth
and
a
little
roastiness
flavor
is
about
the
same
and
well
balanced
not
much
sweetness
nor
too
much
of
anything
really
body
is
nice
and
so
is
carbonation
real
easy
drinking
beer
nice
clean
finish
definitely
a
session
the
body
is
pretty
thin
even
for
the
style
carbonation
is
good
however
classic
germanstyle
high
drinkability
mouthfeel
was
lighter
than
expected
but
still
would
consider
a
mediumbodied
brew
pretty
sure
this
is
an
old
bottle
but
it
is
still
a
terrific
german
dunkel
you
wont
find
any
of
the
american
craft
breweries
turning
out
anything
like
this
i
could
drink
this
all
day
at
a
sunny
sidewalk
cafe
in
munich
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
dunkel
clear
dark
reddishbrown
minimal
offwhite
head
dark
bready
caramelly
malt
wsome
dark
dried
fruit
in
the
nose
characterful
malts
dominate
the
taste
as
well
with
a
noticeable
sweetness
finishing
dry
and
slightly
tart
light
to
medium
in
body
and
crisp
quite
sessionable
would
be
great
fresh
ontap
this
would
be
great
to
serve
at
a
party
the
flip
top
makes
for
a
great
conversation
piece
but
at
3
a
bottle
us
its
a
little
impractical
d
a
nice
mild
yet
interesting
beer
i
could
imagine
enjoying
a
liter
or
two
in
a
german
square
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
clear
amber
brown
with
no
head
basically
nose
is
way
too
sickly
sweet
malts
not
entirely
pleasant
flavor
brings
a
bit
of
the
same
but
with
a
bit
of
an
earthy
tone
and
a
slight
leafy
thing
too
much
malt
sweetness
though
feel
is
slick
and
sticky
carbonation
nips
a
bit
at
the
tongue
eh
this
is
okay
like
i
said
too
malty
sweet
pass
this
pours
an
absolutely
beautiful
deep
copper
and
burnt
orange
color
with
a
gorgeous
airy
white
head
massive
lacing
and
heaving
carbonation
make
for
a
near
perfect
appearance
the
is
soft
and
floral
with
big
cracker
and
toast
notes
subtle
hoppiness
adds
depth
to
this
malty
lager
the
taste
is
equally
impressive
with
rich
caramel
and
vienna
malt
characteristics
a
nice
hop
finish
cleans
up
the
flavors
and
dries
out
nicely
very
slight
toffee
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
the
sharp
carbonation
thins
out
the
body
and
makes
this
insanely
drinkable
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
gritty
and
metalic
but
in
the
best
way
a
biscuit
with
caramel
and
hops
in
liquid
form
i
feel
privileged
to
sample
this
fresh
and
find
it
to
be
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
session
brews
i
have
tried
this
is
truly
a
style
that
is
not
cherished
nearly
enough
in
the
us
i
would
probably
get
again
why
does
it
come
in
a
tiny
bottle
when
it
should
be
served
on
draft
by
the
liter
salud
pours
amber
with
a
nice
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
smells
toasty
and
grainy
like
a
gresh
baked
loaf
of
whole
grain
bread
a
touch
of
honeyed
malt
sweetness
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
similar
but
a
bit
lighter
and
grainier
rather
than
breadier
fairly
light
in
body
and
dry
up
front
with
a
sweeter
finish
decent
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
to
really
session
despite
the
low
abv
fizzy
and
effervescent
this
dunkel
lacks
a
bit
in
the
way
of
depth
and
body
semisweet
maltyness
combines
with
some
earthy
bittering
hops
to
form
a
simple
easy
drinking
brew
smooth
light
bodied
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
far
from
bad
but
falls
short
of
a
really
good
dunkel
a
nice
value
at
under
2
a
bottle
i
will
probably
give
this
one
a
go
again
i
dont
prefer
lighter
lagers
like
this
because
of
the
lack
of
flavor
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
it
was
free
decent
drinking
although
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
esp
due
to
the
premium
price
here
in
china
this
beer
is
ok
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
light
smooth
easy
drinking
thirst
quenching
very
nice
this
beer
is
great
looking
and
delicious
one
of
the
better
beers
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
ill
definitely
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
one
more
often
an
absolutely
fantastic
dunkel
recommended
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
this
style
or
is
looking
for
something
a
notch
up
from
the
warsteiner
thats
typically
the
most
prominent
dunkel
imported
in
the
united
states
quite
light
in
body
clear
copper
color
with
a
nice
lasting
beige
head
some
medium
roasty
sweet
malt
and
nutty
smells
kind
of
light
bodied
but
nice
nuttiness
to
the
flavor
nice
mild
nutty
aftertaste
and
a
pretty
nice
little
beer
all
around
very
sessionable
and
i
would
actually
get
this
again
d
super
drinkable
my
new
session
beer
the
warsteiner
lacked
some
flavor
and
becks
dark
in
my
opinion
chose
the
wrong
combination
of
hops
bass
is
good
but
is
so
malt
oriented
it
will
get
boring
after
a
while
this
is
wonderful
a
little
out
of
the
way
from
the
mainstream
but
worth
every
penny
overall
i
was
expecting
a
darker
colour
from
a
munich
dunkel
overall
a
very
appealing
and
balanced
beer

very
solid
for

though
the
color
was

expected
has
a
more
reddish
color
to
me
than
browni
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
little
darker
smells
of
nice
light
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
the

in
the
picture
is
not
even
close
to
what
i
got
in
the
pournone
the
lessthis
is
a
fantastic
dunkel
when
you
smell
and
taste
this
beer
you
know
its
german
something
about
the
smell
gives
them
away
i
think
its
the
particular
yeast
strain
not
too
heavy
on
the
palettethe
right
carbonation
lets
the
sweet
malts
shine
through
this
beer
is
sooo
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
going
down
no
rotten
aftertaste
of
any
kind
anyone
who
loves
dark
lagers
do
not
deprive
yourself
of
this
masterpiece
a
highly
drinkable
beer
with
lots
of
character
i
liked
it
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
forming
a
creamy

1
inch
head
leaving
medium
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
strong
sweet
malt
giving
it
a
caramelnutty
smell
the
taste
is
just
as
good
sweet
malts
creating
a
delicious
light
nutty
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
smooth
finish
low
abv
and
exceptional
full
flavor
make
for
a
very
drinkable
brew
overall
i
was
very
impressed
this
is
the
best
dunkel
lager
i
have
had
to
date
highly
recommended
flensburger
dunkel
poured
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
beige
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
swing
top
bottle
the
aroma
is
okay
nothing
special
though
primarily
malt
the
flavor
is
kind
of
average
a
bit
estery
and
some
toasted
or
maybe
slightly
roasted
malt
worth
a
try
i
love
these
bottles
i
will
be
refilling
it
soon
with
my
own
concoction
beer
looks
very
pretty
after
you
pour
it

dark
clear
amber
color
with
a
very
good
off

and
good
lacing
smell
is
slightly
malty
i
taste
a
lot
of
toasted
malts
very
full
with
a
slight
nuttyness
this
beer
finishes
with
a
slight
sweetness
that
is
pleasant
this
style
of
lager
is
probably
my
favorite
overall
a
solid
beer
to
enjoy
pours
transparent
redbrown
with
an
inch
of

the

full
of

hops
are
predominant

with

head
though
which
is
surprising
amber
color
rather
still
looking
the
smell
is

primarily
but
very
muted
overall
the

with

hops
are

the

a

is
good
as
the

is
refreshing
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
spectacular
id
drink
it
again
i
reckon
if
i
were
the
reckoning
type
which
i
am
drinkability
this
would
make
a
fabulous
session
brew
a
very
good
beer
that
i
must
try
again
d
drinkability
is
high
i
need
to
come
back
to
this
12oz
swing
top
bottle
this
one
pours
a
rich
clear
amber
color
there
is
a
small
offwhite
head
that
goes
with
it
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
malty
without
being
overly
sweet
some
breadiness
there
also
as
well
as
some
faint
chocolate
somewhat
dry
biscuity
malt
taste
some
mild
spicy
hoppiness
also
this
is
quite
good
nearly
average
in

worthy
enough
for
a

do

the
cool

stubby
swing
top
verdict
let
down
at
first
i
thought
i
bought
a
dunkel
weizen
until
i
tried
it
but
it
grew
on
me
after
a
bit
though
its
nothing
special
i
wouldnt
turn
one
away
but
wouldnt
seek
another
out
either
a
simple
dark
lager
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
true
to
its
style
drinkabilitynotes
overall
a
pleasant
drinkable
example
poured
from
a
12oz
fliptop
bottle
with
a
date
on
the
back
label
good
head
and
almost
no
carb
had
a
brownish
cooper
color
and
a
sweet
malty
smell
with
overtones
of
bread
the
taste
was
really
good
this
is
the
first
of
the
style
that
ive
had
and
i
was
impressed
will
have
to
try
move
dunkle
lagers
and
see
if
it
holds
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
was
that
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
watery
not
enough
to
ruin
it
but
enough
to
remind
you
on
every
drink
overall
good
beer
and
recommend

small

when
held
to
the

sticky

like

hard
to
tell
its
a
weisse
at
all
quite
flat
as
far
as
carbonation
goes
flavour
hugely
dependent
on
malt
which
carries
itself
a
little
weak
little
resonance
no
mouthfeel
void
of
any
character
no
aftertaste
but
no
before
taste
either
some
smokey
wood
character
kept
me
guessing
as
to
what
it
is
exactly
somethig
good
is
in
there
but
darn
hard
to
find
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
it
was
medium
in
feel
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
the
sweetness
is
a
good
bit
more
aggressive
than
most
dunkels
but
it
is
still
a
nice
and
easily
drinkable
beer
i
would
suspect
that
this
is
more
of
what
a
historical
dunkel
would
be
like
since
the
attenuation
of
yeast
has
gone
up
over
the
ages
perhaps
this
is
more
like
an
original
einbecker
still
this
is
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
shot
drinkability
is
very
high
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
one
terribly
underrepresented
on
the
market
the
beer
was
dark
in
color
and
had
a
really
good
taste
to
it
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
dunkels
but
this
one
was
really
good
i
drank
this
beer
very
cold
and
i
recommend
drinking
it
cold
md
high
carbonation
medheavy

very
filling
flensburger
dunkel
is
a
decent
munich
dunkel
lager
although
i
wont
be
cracking
its
swingtop
again
if
i
buy
any
of
the
flensburger
beers
in
the
future
itll
be
the
weizen
give
this
one
a
whirl
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
otherwise
you
wont
regret
missing
it
a
very
good
dunkel
from
the
far
north
of
germany
its
too
bad
this
style
is
so
underrepresented
among
german
imports
this
looks
like
a
perfect
octoberfest
too
bad
its
a
dunkel
the
malt
flavors
emerge
as
it
warms
the
last
taste
was
better
than
the
first
reminds
me
very
much
of
an
alt
bier
from
its
location
on
the
map
it
looks
like
flensburg
shares
the
hanseatic
heritage
of
dusseldorf
and
that
heritage
shows
in
this
beer
highly
recommend
particuarly
if
you
are
an
alt
afficianado
im
getting
used
to
these
flensburger
brews
pretty
good
stuff

i
only
bought
one
to
try
and
will
return
for
a
few
more

and
enjoyable

overcoming
my
initial
misgivings
based
on

very
well
made
with
no

the
flavor
is
subdued
and
the

thinnish
pours
out
a
crystaline
nut
brown
with
amber
edges
and
an
eggshell
head
the
head
is
very
thick
but
not
lasting
it
quickly
fades
to
a
film
over
the
brew
smell
is
strong
with
bits
of
cappuchino
caramel
oat
and
wheat
blend
it
together
in
one

and
youve
got
a
concoction
that
you
can
detect
from
a
good
ten
inches
away
from
a
freshly
poured
glass
starts
extra
smooth
and
refreshingly
crisp
with
a

with
lots

there
is
a
sugary
undertone
to
the
fullbodied

sour

bitter
dry
and
strong
the
aftertaste
is
just
as
edgy
and

as
the
rest
of
the

this
is
a
light
to
medium

the
beer
is

12
oz
swing
top

a
clear
dark

with

creamy

glass
bready
fruity
aromas
nutty
caramel
chocolate
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
a
great
lager
the
aroma
is
toasted
grain
and
breadlike
malts
the
taste
is
toasted
bread
citric
style
hop
and
as
i
find
with
alot
of
german
beers
a
metallic
background
though
thisone
has
a
hint
of
salty
water
it
doesnt
hurt
drinkability
for
its
a
nice
little
dunkel
with
a
cool
little
bottle
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
munich
dunkel
lager
and
i
am
not
formiliar
with
the
style
it
reminded
me
of
a
darker
alt
beer
so
very
drinkable
and
with
a
nice
maltiness
pours
clear
copper
under
a
1
5
finger
offwhite
head
with
some
contour
and
decent
retention
a
few
spots
of
lace
linger
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
mild
caramel
with
a
distinct
flowery
hops
note
the
mouth
is
thin
and
well
carbonated
the
taste
is
very
subdued
some
mild
smooth
sweet
caramel
malt
throughout
without
much
in
the
way
of
hops
backing
a
pleasant
enough
brew
but
nothing
exciting
notes
a
very
welldone
dunkel
balanced
and
traditional
its
also
easy
on
the
palate
and
very
refeshing
notes
an
easy
drinking
amber
lager
clean
with
full
grain
flavours
is
just
what
i
was
looking
for
in
this
beer
typical
in
a
way
but
good
none
the
less
othis
was
a
great
beer
i
love
the
taste
all
around
o
this
beer
is
great
and
i
wish
more
american
brewers
would
try
their
hand
at
munich
dunkel
lagers
because
theres
a
lot
of
room
to
play
with
these
flavors
and
experiment
until
then
seek
out
lobo
negro
when
you
are
in
texas
very
good
dunkel
they
have
great
water
quality
and
that
really
enhances
the
taste
of
this
beer
i
enjoy
it
for
lighter
beer
a
good
solid
beer
not
as
malty
and
roast
character
is
not
as
subtle
as
a
munich
dunkel
but
roast
is
not
as
overdone
as
many
american
breweries
attempting
the
style
but
still
one
of
the
better
attempts
ive
tasted
from
an
american
brewery
darker
than
what
the
style
calls
for
i
believe
id
definitely
drink
it
again
but
would
seek
out
a
true
german
dunkel
when
wanting
to
satisfy
my
dunkel
craving
coffee
taste
very
soothing
enjoy
it
very
much
great
head
on
pour
not
advertised
as
a
dunkel
looks
like
a
stout
and
taste
like
a
black
ipa
would
still
recommend
it
definitely
worth
drinking
ill
pick
up
again
when
im
in
san
antonio
but
not
worth
seeking
out
here
in
the
north
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
good
one
ive
had
pedernales
at
a
local
tasting
and
remembered
this
one
now
that
ive
had
a
full
bottle
i
can
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
dunkel
this
is
a
beefy
brew
that
commands
attention
in
a
good
way
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
it
trying
some
foodpairings
and
maybe
braising
a
darkbreasted
game
bird
in
lobo
negro
opretty
nice
dark
lager
beer
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
one
last
note
this
beer
tastes
very
fresh
overall
a
good
beer
just
wish
the
smell
and
inital
flavor
were
improved
i
will
have
it
again
though
a
surprisingly
good
beer
that
seems
to
be
more
in
the
german
vein
than
than
the
usual
haphazard
styling
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
texas
wine
in
fredericksburg

after

overall
this
is
an
damn
nice
dunkel
lager
great
balance
and
robustness
of
malt
flavors
with
moderate
fruitiness
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
better
examples
in
the
style
i
have
had
i
have
never
been
a
huge
negro
fan
but
i
really
like
this
one
it
has
the
right
combo
of
coffee
and
caramel
for
me
sounds
crazy
but
if
you
have
not
tried
it
make
a
float
with
it
a
scoop
of
blue
bell
original
vanilla
and
pour
some
lobo
negro
over
it
yum
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pinttulip
glass
this
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
smaller
tan
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
of
caramel
toffee
and
nuts
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
okay
a
little
bitter
roasted
malts
some
toffee
not
bad
nice
flavor
profile
too
sweetness
is
tangible
but
not
overboard
and
the
chocolate
flavors
are
really
nice
there
is
still
a
bit
of
nutty
caramel
character
too
the
mouthfeel
is
a
treat
rich
and
creamy
for
a
lager
and
the
carbonation
is
really
finebubbled
fits
the
style
profile
fairly
well
but
also
has
a
bit
of
a
milk
stout
aspect
to
it
as
well
after
a
bad
introduction
to
pedernales
the
ipa
the
texas
lager
and
negro
lobo
have
impressed
me
enough
to
pick
up
a
sixer
next
time
i
see
it
around
id
buy
again
for
sure
found
this
beer
while
on
our
anniversary
trip
to
fredericksburg
tx
immediately
feel
in
love
with
this
dark
rich
double
bock
beer
tried
to
find
it
in
san
antonio
but
no
luck
smells
great
smooth
taste
with
a
wonderful
hint
of
chocolate
caramel
flavors
must
try
if
you
can
find
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
some
lightly
toasted
malt
and
cocoa
notes
a
very
nice
smelling
beer
the
flavor
is
made
up
of
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
i
also
get
some
toffee
grass
and
earth
notes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
drink
this
beer
often
on
draft
but
i
believe
this
is
the
first
bottle
ive
ever
had
its
a
really
enjoyable
drinkable
and
affordable
import
the
flavor
profile
shows
a
ton
of
depth
while
staying
easy
drinking
and
fairly
light
many
12
liters
of
this
has
could
and
will
be
had
by
me
in
the
future
overall
a
nice
tasting
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
brown
with
a
yellowishtan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
lots
of
things
going
on
in
the
aroma
especially
as
it
warms
a
bit
bready
munich
malt
chocolate
molasses
nutty
and
a
strong
sweet
smell
taste
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
this
is
not
a
munich
dunkel
style
theres
some
rye
malt
character
there
with
a
weaker
hop
profile
much
like
a
euro
dark
lager
whether
it
fits
the
munich
dunkel
taste
profile
exactly
or
not
this
is
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
grainy
bready
flavors
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
ripe
fruity
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
lighttomedium
carbonation
level
making
it
silky
smooth
no
alcohol
warmth
detected
paired
very
nicely
with
the
warm
buttered
pumpernickel
i
had
with
it
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
for
a
great
price
i
paid
2
39
for
a
single
16
9
oz
bottle
i
will
definitely
grab
this
one
again
o
just
an
average
dunkel
beer
but
for
a
price
of
just
over
2
i
would
say
it
met
my
expectations
though
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
get
it
again
as
there
are
a
lot
of
other
dunkel
beers
i
would
rather
have
and
pay
more
for
o
decent
overall
brew
with
subtle
flavors
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
there
is
a
mild
scent
of
hops
and
malts
but
nothing
too
strong
the
taste
is
ever
so
slightly
heavy
in
taste
but
not
by
much
there
is
a
decent
combination
of
hops
malts
and
yeast
to
make
a
dark
beer
that
drinks
fairly
easy
although
it
drinks
well
it
really
could
use
some
work
in
flavor
department
as
the
taste
is
kind
of
bland
for
a
small
city
this
was
a
rather
interesting
find
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
closer
to
the
source
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
bodied
with
mediumhigh
levels
of
carbonation
that
foams
the
beer
up
substantially
on
contact
with
the
palate
resulting
mouthfeel
is
at
first
fizzy
then
smooth
and
creamy
finishes
wet
with
little
residual
stickiness
around
palate
or
lips
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
wish
that
tangy
finish
was
more
subtle
its
a
bit
less
rich
than
the
style
picture
a
schwarzbier
malt
richness
with
munich
dunkel
flavor
profile
and
youre
pretty
close
might
have
been
thinned
a
bit
by
age
try
saying
this
beers
name
several
times
fast
fun
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
dark
fruit
very
light
roasted
malts
light
toffee
and
raisins
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
extra
roast
a
touch
of
toasted
bread
and
a
sprig
of
light
clove
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
wet
feel
overall
a
very
nice
munich
dunkel
easydrinking
and
tasty
good
times
very
enjoyable
looks
amazing
and
smelled
and
tasted
great
tough
to
beat
o
tasted
a
lot
like
a
quad
it
was
good
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
has
a
really
good
flavor
definitely
would
drink
this
one
again
d
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
beer
while
still
maintaining
some
deeprich
belgian
flavors
overall
i
love
this
beer
probably
the
best
dunkel
lager
ive
experienced
just
a
killer
beer
reasonable
price
too
i
gotta
get
more
of
this
pretty
good
dark
euro
lager
what
im
judging
against
but
nothing
memorable
o
this
is
an
okay
munich
dunkel
lager
easy
drinking
and
pretty
tasty
a
well
puttogether
dunkel
i
would
like
to
try
more
beers
from
this
brewery
this
the
pils
are
both
solid
brews
poured
a
capped
500ml
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
massive
3
inch
creamy
cap
that
leaves
some
pretty
substantial
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
good
start
the
aroma
starts
off
with
a
little
overly
toasted
bread
with
just
a
little
bit
of
coffee
and
dry
mocha
powder
nice
roasted
aroma
but
fairly
one
dimensional
the
flavor
continues
that
line
nice
roasted
flavor
starts
off
toasted
bread
with
just
a
little
chocolate
powder
mixed
with
with
this
odd
underlying
sweetness
not
sugary
per
say
but
almost
like
a
generic
grape
juice
sweetness
just
a
touch
of
ripe
tree
fruits
no
perceivable
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
just
a
bit
of
dryness
at
the
finish
while
im
a
huge
fan
of
crisp
clean
lagers
i
feel
that
this
one
is
just
a
bit
one
dimensional
a
delicate
and
highly
drinkable
beer
with
a
slight
vegital
taste
the
beer
hides
its
flaws
well
and
is
cause
for
subtle
enjoyment
the
first
thing
that
is
impressive
about
this
beer
is
an
outstanding
dark
rubygarnet
color
the
head
is
rich
and
generous
with
excellent
retention
and
even
thin
lacing
the
smell
is
sublime
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
wafting
above
clean
light
hops
and
slight
hints
of
fruit
the
flavor
profile
is
fantastic
lighter
than
expected
but
quite
rich
mainly
i
get
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
but
it
washes
down
with
a
very
refreshing
lightness
it
is
actually
very
hard
to
describe
the
flavors
hiding
in
this
complex
beer
there
are
some
fruit
undertones
and
a
hint
of
very
mellow
hops
but
it
is
all
very
subtle
the
enjoyment
is
there
is
every
sip
though
there
are
no
downsides
and
i
can
find
nothing
that
detracts
from
the
great
flavor
the
body
is
medium
and
the
mouth
feel
is
superb
of
course
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
this
on
tap
and
i
understand
from
talking
to
others
that
this
is
definitely
a
better
on
tap
beer
or
maybe
all
beers
are
after
all
please
track
this
down
and
try
it
if
at
all
possible
drinkability
a
touch
too
much
for
regular
consumption
for
this
buckaroo
but
not
a
waste
edit
my
rating
on
morchl
appears
to
be
pretty
low
the
thing
is
i
like
this
style
quite
a
bit
and
was
trying
to
be
fair
here
and
trying
hard
not
to
overrate
rate
it
too
highly
cest
la
vie
this
is
definitely
an
above
average
beer
and
id
say
its
wellworth
your
time
to
seek
out
a
fresh
bottle
deasy
so
smooth
that
i
was
willing
to
bet
i
could
chug
this
beer
without
a
problem
youd
have
to
know
me
to
be
surprised
by
that
i
suppose
the
alcohol
content
and
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
make
it
a
solid
choice
id
do
it
again
in
a
heart
beat
taste
little
caramel
with
some
unsweetened
cocoa
powder
not
too
bad
hops
in
the
finish
are
very
mild
kinda
herbal
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
not
as
drinkable
as
some
but
full
of
flavor
and
worth
a
taste
d
definitely
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
a
fine
upstanding
beer
surprised
at
how
good
it
is
given
its
modest
2
49
price
tag
will
not
only
seek
this
out
again
but
will
buy
a
lot
d
easytodrink
maltforward
lager
modest
spice
and
roast
fairly
forgettable
flavors
yet
quite
drinkable
low
abv
helps
but
generally
good
scores
across
the
board
dont
hurt
at
all
a
stein
and
a
plate
of
sauerbraten
or
schnitzel
sounds
pretty
good
after
this
very
much
worth
a
try
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
note
after
reviewing
my
reviews
ha
i
noticed
that
this
is
the
only
beer
of
its
style
that
ive
ever
given
score
much
over
a
3
0
seriously
this
is
in
a
whole
nother
league
than
the
rest
i
know
its
only
5
abv
but
this
is
like
an
imperial
munich
lager
or
something
dvery
drinkable
the
relatively
light
body
lends
this
beer
its
ease
of
drinking
plus
its
quite
tasty
indeed
this
beer
produced
a
nice
head
when
poured
however
the
foam
quickly
dissipated
and
left
me
with
nothing
in
contrast
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
the
bubbles
dance
across
my
tongue
the
aroma
is
malty
and
musty
thus
not
very
appealing
despite
the
funky
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
malty
from
start
to
finish
i
also
detect
a
note
of
black
pepper
and
other
spices
fine
drinkability
in
fact
ive
been
able
to
get
my
cheap
beer
drinking
friends
to
enjoy
this
brew
not
a
big
flavorful
beerdunkels
are
simple
affairs
mostly
this
is
a
fairly
nice
one
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
opaque
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
carbonation
is
medium
but
very
pleasing
aromas
are
biscuity
with
hints
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
almost
identical
yet
intense
it
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
mild
hop
bite
for
a
dark
lager
its
lighter
bodied
than
others
i
have
had
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
makes
a
great
a
great
session
beer
mmmm
very
nice
beer
got
this
bottle
at
sams
in
chi
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
poured
with
a
huge
textured
foamy
and
frothy
tan
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
nice
dark
walnut
aroma
is
malty
with
toffee
and
mild
flavor
is
similar
with
some
lurking
sweetness
great
body
with
fine
carbonation
and
soft
mouth
goes
very
well
with
flavor
nice
easy
finish
session
beer
a
nice
dark
lager
with
a
very
consistent
malt
i
have
found
the
fresher
the
better
off
chocolate
milk
head
of
about
3
fingers
coca
cola
color
with
not
much
murk
really
a
heavy
odor
bread
when
agitated
mild
otherwise
apple
malt
which
carries
over
to
something
a
bit
sour
on
the
palate
there
is
some
dough
some
chocolate
and
an
ever
more
present
smoke
as
the
beer
get
warmer
this
bring
out
the
acidic
quality
of
the
beer
not
as
good
at
higher
temperatures
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
opaue
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
more
forthcoming
than
the
aroma
toffee
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
muchen
dunkel
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
the
remarkably
dry
finish
of
this
beer
really
seals
the
deal
for
me
i
think
that
this
is
a
stunning
rendition
of
the
dunkel
style
a
rather
nice
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
its
not
as
strong
or
heavy
as
a
dopplebock
nor
as
light
as
a
bock
but
i
like
the
dark
fruits
and
molasses
recommended
reasonably
priced
drinkability
hirter
i
hardly
know
er
pours
a
brownishblack
with
a
small
almost
non
existent
head
smells
sweet
and
caramely
with
a
strong
alcohol
note
first
sip
is
pure
caramel
sweet
sweet
and
more
sweet
finishes
nice
and
bitter
carbonated
well
if
you
like
caramelized
sweet
beers
you
will
not
be
disappointed
not
bad
when
i
bought
this
bottle
in
kcmo
i
never
seen
it
before
or
heard
of
it
i
thought
it
was
a
baltic
porter
because
the
label
says
malt
liquor
and
dark
beer
i
just
made
the
assumption
oh
well
i
liked
this
beer
well
enough
and
it
was
cheap
but
really
it
is
not
something
ill
buy
again
on
second
thought
this
beer
is
growing
on
me
it
is
pretty
darn
tasty
this
is
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
but
unfortunately
it
isnt
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
it
came
so
close
which
is
actually
more
of
a
letdown
than
a
beer
that
is
just
ok
the
taste
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
for
this
type
of
beer
very
subtle
balances
of
malt
caramel
and
oaki
think
it
is
also
a
tad
bit
sweet
but
not
over
the
top
all
the
tastes
are
just
right
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
as
well
good
carbonation
and
nice
finish
a
very
satisfying
brew
we
all
like
this
beer
make
no
mistake
though
this
beer
has
made
it
in
as
one
of
my
current
favorites
others
may
prefer
a
more
subtle
drink
but
this
beer
clubbed
me
over
the
head
and
dragged
me
back
to
her
cave
even
though
morchl
is
less
than
good
beer
its
better
than
the
only
other
brauerei
hirt
offering
that
ive
had
so
far
privat
pils
if
it
wasnt
for
the
label
dating
i
would
have
pointed
to
age
as
the
culprit
for
the
crime
of
mediocrity
since
the
brewery
was
kind
enough
to
be
consumer
friendly
they
have
no
excuses
that
will
hold
up
for
as
rich
and
fulltasting
as
the
beer
is
there
is
a
slight
thinness
to
the
brew
a
tad
slick
on
the
finish
not
my
favorite
style
by
a
longshot
but
easy
enough
to
drink
if
its
your
bag
a
good
not
great
take
on
a
german
standard
those
wacky
austrians
served
an
tap
at
the
map
room
overall
a
nice
dark
lager
from
austria
pours
a
clear
pinkish
brown
under
a
34
finger
beige
head
that
lasts
forever
but
still
fails
to
generate
any
lace
the
nose
is
mild
but
very
enticing
with
clear
if
not
strong
sweet
caramel
tones
the
mouth
is
well
carbonated
and
quite
sticky
coating
all
sides
with
a
viscous
coating
that
prolongs
the
taste
sensation
and
the
taste
is
quite
good
slightly
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
at
first
yield
to
a
slightly
burnt
espresso
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
very
well
this
is
definitely
not
your
average
viennese
dunkel
it
has
spirit
and
character
easily
my
favorite
bottled
austrian
beer
after
2
5
months
of
fairly
intensive
research
very
smooth
dark
beer
with
hints
of
an
amber
ale
overall
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
its
an
excellent
version
of
a
bavarian
dunkel
overall
a
serviceable
brew
and
one
that
i
could
session
a
few
of
but
one
on
the
lower
end
of
the
taste
scale
light
for
the
style
beer
i
had
it
on
tap
and
was
vary
surprised
by
taste
and
smell
highly
recommended
6
99
a
six
pack
its
a
great
value
if
i
was
rating
on
price
alone
it
would
be
a
5
compared
to
other
beers
in
that
price
range
pours
a
pretty
darker
amber
in
color
with
a
good
almost
2fingers
beige
head
that
settles
down
to
about
2mm
on
top
nice
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
some
in
rings
even
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
perfect
carbonation
and
isnt
overdone
the
aroma
is
of
malts
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
caramel
even
more
going
on
with
the
taste
than
the
aroma
suggests
with
a
hint
of
nut
and
cocoa
even
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
truly
a
really
good
brew
o
munich
dunkel
might
not
be
the
most
popular
style
in
the
craft
beer
world
but
this
germanstyle
brewer
has
nailed
the
classic
dark
german
lager
with
slingshot
nutty
breadlike
maltiness
never
becomes
too
sweet
or
aggressive
just
finishing
cleanly
for
a
really
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
solid
beer
if
the
palate
transferred
the
sweet
complexities
of
the
nose
this
beer
would
be
in
my
fridge
indefinitely
overall
not
too
bad
for
a
dunkel
o
no
glaring
flaws
but
no
discernible
character
either
honestly
it
reminds
me
of
an
extract
homebrew
if
my
buddy
had
home
brewed
this
i
would
drink
it
i
would
however
not
pay
for
it
overall
very
well
made
beer
worth
a
look
if
you
like
german
beers
could
compete
with
some
true
germanmade
beers
notes
quite
a
nice
example
for
the
style
wonderful
body
and
a
nice
flavor
not
outstanding
though
great
malt
body
and
although
it
is
sweet
it
isnt
cloying
or
sticky
or
too
sweet
nice
hints
of
hops
esters
are
also
nice
and
not
overpowering
thankfully
easily
the
best
offering
from
old
man
river
a
nice
tasty
sessionable
malty
lager
something
of
a
rarity
these
days
m
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
goes
great
with
an
avocado
blackbean
burger
yes
i
know
kind
of
an
untraditional
pairing
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
clean
and
refreshing
as
the
lighter
wheat
beer
counterparts
but
its
not
overpoweringly
sticky
like
some
stouts
or
porters
may
be
good
carbonation
flavor
is
similarly
sweet
nutty
almond
or
walnut
with
a
mild
dry
bitter
aftertaste
mild
and
easygoing
light
bodied
a
pint
or
three
would
be
easy
to
session
this
was
good
stuff
its
not
everyday
you
get
to
try
a
dunkel
from
iowa
a
yummy
session
lager
for
those
who
like
the
style
or
lagers
in
general
this
place
is
a
nice
stop
craft
drinkers
demanding
all
big
beers
all
the
time
should
probably
head
elsewhere
whoa
this
is
a
study
in
average
at
best
poured
with
a
fine
foamy
off
white
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
medium
to
dark
amber
aroma
is
very
mild
with
malt
and
a
bare
hint
of
roastiness
flavor
is
super
mild
too
body
is
ok
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
ok
and
forgetable
jubliate
dark
lager
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
brown
with
a
tan
head
nutty
malt
and
a
slight
hint
of
dark
dried
fruit
provide
the
nose
on
the
palate
clean
nutty
malt
tastes
combine
with
kettle
sugars
and
light
roast
flavors
from
the
dark
malts
there
are
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
interesting

for

didnt

simply

like
the

tasted
as
much

to
me
as
beer
not
sure
if
this
is
normal
for
an
organic
beer
either
way
will
not
purchase
again
pours
murky
brown
amber
very
little
of
a
white
head
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
doppelbock
mixed
with
an
oktoberfest
the
beer
has
massive
caramel
qualities
and
flavors
that
dominate
the
tongue
the
beer
has
a
nice
dark
fruit
presence
as
well
there
is
a
dark
grain
presence
in
this
beer
that
is
again
all
toffee
and
caramel
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
velvety
smooth
and
quite
creamy
there
is
a
slight
tart
fruit
flavor
in
this
beer
as
well
overall
its
a
nice
old
fashioned
german
brew
c
overall
a
pleasant
easy
to
drink
beer
that
i
could
see
drinking
almost
anytime
poured
into
a
tall
wine
glass
color
was
a
medium
dark
amber
with
a
thin
dirty
white
head
head
lasted
only
a
few
minutes
before
leaving
some
lacings
that
clung
to
the
sides
reasonable
amount
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
in
no
particular
pattern
aroma
was
very
slightly
sweet
that
shifted
to
a
subtle
malty
grain
flavor
reminded
me
a
slightly
spicypeppery
wheat
bread
felt
a
tad
thin
and
bubbly
in
the
mouth
overall
not
a
bad
beer
well
priced
for
an
imported
organic
o
a
good
beer
definitely
worth
trying
but
lacks
some
of
the
toasty
breadlike
quality
i
was
hoping
for
i
dont
think
ill
get
this
beer
again
even
if
it
is
organic
but
i
would
like
to
try
some
other
beers
from
this
brewery

boulevard
pours
a
very
watered
down
looking
light
to
medium
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
comprised
of
huge
bubbles
but
they
burst
and
retreat
immediately
the
glass
may
have
been
a
little
soapy
still
so
somebody
comfirm
this
appearance
smells
like
chocolate
malts
and
a
bit
of
doughnuty
sweet
malt
flavor
is
the
best
asset
as
it
should
be
with
plenty
of
roasty
and
milk
chocolately
malt
heft
no
hops
in
here
to
speak
of
and
a
quickly
fading
aftertaste
feel
is
on
the
weak
side
light
to
medium
body
and
fair
carbonation
more
body
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
overall
i
liked
this
unique
flavor
profile
for
a
german
beer
and
its
organic
so
plus
for
that
but
a
bit
more
depth
of
feel
could
bring
it
up
in
my
book
and
if
they
were
trying
to
replicate
an
oldschool
beer
then
this
flavor
makes
a
lot
more
sense
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
isnt
bad
but
the
tangy
character
of
the
alcohol
i
could
live
without
it
seems
a
bit
off
for
the
style
take
that
away
and
you
have
a
fairly
decent
dunkel
here
i
like
the
mouthfeel
and
aroma
as
ive
continued
to
drink
i
think
the
sourness
and
raisin
tones
would
become
an
issue
in
how
drinkable
good
but
not
my
favorite
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
but
also
not
very
intriguing
or
interesting
o
a
great
dunkel
this
one
is
sweet
and
hearty
o
the
term
organic
is
a
legally
defined
term
that
means
nothing
like
what
it
implies
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
ive
had
dunkels
at
bier
halls
in
munich
and
ive
had
many
a
lager
this
is
something
different
yet
very
familiar
well
worth
a
try
or
2
overall
its
generally
fairly
basic
but
with
an
emphasis
on
malt
flavor
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
yet
its
never
cloying
its
maltiness
is
kind
of
like
that
of
a
bock
but
less
full
and
not
as
dark
think
of
it
as
a
standard
munich
dunkel
but
amped
up
a
bit
its
really
quite
nice
its
remarkably
drinkable
and
it
seems
to
go
quite
well
with
food
after
tasting
the
initial
bottle
i
had
another
one
with
a
fresh
light
pasta
sauce
made
ingredients
from
my
garden
tomato
onion
garlic
some
green
pepper
and
basilthymeoregano
and
olive
oil
saltpepper
and
pecorino
romano
cheese
and
it
was
a
splendid
match
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
brilliant
with
pizza
well
worth
trying
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
taste
is
of
malts
caramel
slightly
sweet
a
faint
hint
of
hops
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
good
example
of
the
style
more
maltyness
would
seal
the
deal
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
dark
lager
but
after
a
while
it
starts
to
taste
a
bit
watery
overall
a
simple
pleasing
dark
lager
which
takes
the
taste
buds
to
rural
germany
in
that
it
tastes
very
authentic
and
true
to
brewing
traditions
of
the
region
give
it
a
shot
you
might
like
it
or
hate
it
overall
very
drinkable
a
satisfying
brew
for
sure
opinion
like
the
altbier
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
it
still
has
the
elements
of
a
german
beer
so
it
isnt
completely
off
the
mark
at
least
it
is
in
the
right
country
but
the
beer
is
pretty
far
off
for
the
style
this
one
isnt
as
far
off
as
the
alt
but
it
like
its
brother
has
too
much
of
some
qualities
and
not
enough
of
others
to
make
it
stand
up
to
the
classics
in
the
styles
again
this
beer
is
better
overall
than
the
alt
imo
and
comes
closer
to
the
style
but
it
just
isnt
the
best
representation
i
have
found
othis
beer
was
not
anything
overly
impressive
just
a
nice
well
balanced
beer
appears
dark
amber
caramel
tinted
body
with
a
light
khaki
head
forming
thick
and
billowing
with
fine
bubbles
fine
lacing
coats
the
sides
of
the
glass
nice
touch
of
dark
fruit
roasted
malts
nothing
too
overbearing
still
very
german
in
nature
applesraisins
with
hints
of
malted
barley
and
grassy
hops
flavor
has
juicy
caramel
maltshints
of
raisin
and
apple
juiciness
overall
nice
flavor
going
on
i
cant
really
get
enough
of
the
pinkus
offerings
their
simple
but
yet
really
flavorful
burp
noble
hops
as
you
sip
enjoy
the
light
crisp
body
with
natural
carbonation
levels
drinkability
is
awesome
one
of
the
best
dark
lagers
ive
come
across
recently
d
i
would
drink
this
beer
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
deep
amber
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
caramel
and
light
roasted
malts
in
the
taste
starts
caramel
like
and
ends
with
a
fruitiness
of
white
grapes
but
make
no
mistake
it
is
a
lager
all
the
way
through
a
somewhat
of
a
lager
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
fruitiness
and
lager
notes
in
the
aftertaste
a
clean
lager
and
nice
fruit
notes
d
well
i
dont
think
i
ever
had
a
dunkel
lager
but
having
them
together
seems
to
cancel
each
other
out
no
bitterness
from
the
lager
yet
no
underline
banana
from
the
dunkel
so
it
was
balanced
but
the
flavors
were
just
bland
still
a
great
german
beer
drinks
pretty
well
despite
the
strange
flavor
an
okay
vienna
lager
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
it
has
a
low
alcohol
content
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
this
beer
has
a
darkish
amber
colour
and
nice
1
cm
head
the
smell
is
of
citrus
hops
and
some
breadiness
the
wheatiness
is
immediately
apparent
along
with
some
malt
the
aftertaste
is
sour
and
yeasty
this
beer
feels
great
in
the
mouth
but
i
dont
love
the
flavour
a
maltheavy
concoction
but
still
pleasingly
dry
and
complex
enough
in
its
followthrough
on
the
palate
its
a
bit
more
rough
theres
a
note
of
grainy
husky
astringency
up
front
leading
into
flavors
of
mineral
tart
red
grapes
toast
and
herbal
hops
the
body
is
a
touch
thin
and
theres
a
slight
metallic
astringency
that
puts
me
off
a
bit
its
not
an
offensive
beer
by
any
means
its
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
its
not
uppertier
for
the
style
this
is
quite
the
nice
brew
i
am
really
digging
the
rich
malt
character
in
the
nose
and
even
the
flavor
has
something
similar
this
has
definitely
been
a
nice
surprise
d
an
okay
drinker
sometimes
complexity
is
not
needed
to
make
or
break
a
beer
there
are
subtle
complexities
here
but
its
cleanliness
and
drinkability
along
with
the
oldworld
lager
flavor
makes
this
beer
what
it
is
lovely
stuff
it
isput
it
on
your
must
try
list
this
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
thin
eggshell
head
that
provides
sticky
lacing
there
is
a
slight
haze
as
well
carbonation
is
fine
and
produces
tiny
bubbles
aromas
are
almost
nonexistant
faint
hints
of
biscuit
and
caramel
are
all
i
get
taste
is
more
caramel
and
toast
and
some
cereal
grains
along
with
some
fruity
traits
hops
give
the
beer
a
dry
clean
finish
medium
bodied
yet
this
brew
is
not
filling
a
good
brew
and
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
i
might
add
pours
a
cola
colored
brown
with
light
brown
head
slight
haze
is
noted
nose
has
some
light
bready
aromas
with
perhaps
some
very
gentle
holiday
spices
palate
offers
a
core
flavor
of
toasted
malts
faint
cocoa
and
is
rather
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
dark
russet
brown
with
a
thin
eggshell
head
that
quickly
shrinks
to
a
skim
and
leaves
spotty
lace
on
the
glass
cocoa
caramel
and
toasty
grain
comprise
the
mild
aroma
toasty
malt
and
cocoa
with
a
mild
floral
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
pleasant
enough
but
its
a
little
underwhelming
light
bodied
and
slightly
creamy
with
palate
scrubbing
carbonation
a
little
more
body
and
depth
of
flavor
would
really
help
me
like
this
beer
more
jubilate
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
i
had
not
even
heard
of
this
certified
organic
beer
until
i
was
turned
onto
it
at
bridgewaters
pub
it
poured
with
a
finger
of
fluffy
lighttan
head
with
mild
retention
color
was
a
brownishamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
cereallike
grainy
biscuity
quality
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
chocolatehoneytoasty
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
had
the
distinct
lager
sweetness
a
very
clean
tasting
beer
nicesized
bottle
the
amount
was
just
right
to
enjoy
before
dinner
id
have
it
again
a
little
thin
and
light
on
carb
drinkability
was
surprisingly
high
i
guess
i
kept
drinking
fast
looking
for
more
id
try
it
again
but
wouldnt
look
for
it
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
slightly
tart
im
going
to
taste
again
i
think
the
carbonation
is
giving
me
a
slight
sour
note
to
the
whole
thing
but
not
like
a
sour
there
is
some
bitterness
from
the
grains
at
the
back
overall
its
ok
not
my
favorite
pinkus
but
a
good
beer
only
my
second
pinkus
beer
the
jubilate
pours
a
very
dark
amber
but
is
still
somewhat
transparent
there
is
nice
head
that
laces
the
glass
it
smells
very
rich
somewhat
familiar
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
at
first
a
little
more
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
the
taste
lingers
with
you
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
isnt
bad
i
was
more
than
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
especially
after
seeing
the
overall
rating
i
personally
think
this
one
is
vastly
underrated
500ml

different

from
the
one
in
the
site

is
also
malt

slightly
bitter
with

ok
on

nothing
special
really
nice
enough
beer
but
doesnt
really
appeal
much

not
sure
whether
the
souring
flavor
is
intentional
or
due
to
agemishandling
but
other
reviewers
have
picked
up
on
this
such
a
shame
as
the
beer
has
nice
qualities
otherwise
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beer
but
its
a
solid
dark
and
mild
lager
that
is
worth
drinking
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
drinkability
more
than
a
bit
bland
and
watery
making
for
a
fairly
uninteresting
unrewarding
beverage

on

i
certainly
will
in

most
enjoyable
of
the
3
pinkus
beers
ive
tried
looks
like
it
got
mixed
reviews
i
think
its
delightful
d
decent
enough
but
not
something
id
buy
again
organic
pinkus
jubilate
is
not
worth
the
3
89
that
i
paid
for
it
im
not
even
sure
that
its
worth
half
that
if
you
want
to
try
something
from
this
brewery
go
with
munster
alt
or
ur
pils
bottom
line
sorry
no
jubilation
here
not
bad
but
wouldnt
search
it
out
bet
its
richer
on
tap
d
an
enjoyable
brew
but
nothing
earthshattering
i
do
enjoy
the
fact
that
all
pinkus
brews
are
organic
d
i
always
like
finding
a
new
dunkel
to
try
and
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
very
solid
effort
from
pinkus
taste
is
roasty
malt
a
bit
of
unsweetened
chocolate
with
a
slightly
sour
twang
to
it
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
decent
but
it
very
watery
and
light
it
is
highly
carbonated
but
does
not
seem
to
affect
the
beer
for
better
or
worse
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
and
could
easily
drink
more
than
just
a
couple
if
not
for
the
relatively
high
price
tag
of
3
50
but
it
is
lacking
in
body
and
depth
of
flavor
pours
clear
brown
with
nice
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
good
chocolate
carmel
note
in
the
front
with
a
very
slight
metallic
twinge
that
fades
quicklyslight
sour
taste
in
the
middle
that
is
not
offensive
yet
present
the
malty
sweetness
balances
out
nicely
in
the
mouth
finishing
slightly
dry
and
clean
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
again
that
is
not
cloying
and
fairly
well
balanced
the
fact
that
it
is
organic
adds
to
the
appeal
for
me
the
taste
is
really
affected
by
the
acidity
though
its
not
sour
but
it
seems
like
there
was
a
fault
in
the
brewing
here
but
maybe
it
was
an
old
or
improperly
stored
bottle
it
made
it
unenjoyable
apart
from
the
decent
hefe
ive
been
pretty
disappointed
by
the
pinkus
lineup
grab
it
if
you
like
the
style
or
german
lagers
as
a
whole
highly
drinkable
i
could
have
a
bunch
of
these
what
a
nice
surprise
expected
a
good
beer
but
this
was
fantastic
beer
had
a
very
earthy
aroma
with
toasted
wheat
and
hops
little
bit
of
a
carameltoffee
smell
tasted
similar
with
another
flavor
that
seemed
almost
salty
not
sure
the
flavor
i
felt
like
a
medium
body
that
flowed
smooth
but
not
too
enjoyable
after
taste
i
did
not
enjoy
the
flavor
too
much
but
it
got
better
as
the
beer
developed
and
we
progressed
down
the
glass
drinkability
i
find
it
very
tasty
and
very
comforting
so
i
give
it
great
marks
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
im
glad
it
showed
up
locally
and
for
a
very
reasonable
price
notes
a
solid
dunkel
lager
but
nothing
that
inspires
passion
about
the
style
d
decent
drinkability
for
one
wouldnt
consider
this
session
material
was
a
tad
sweet
and
fruity
but
the
smooth
clean
german
malting
makes
this
worthy
of
at
least
a
try
pours
a
chestnut
color
with
a
thin
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
ring
smells
lightly
roasty
and
with
some
bubblegum
notes
somewhat
grainy
as
well
somewhat
similar
in
the
mouth
but
there
is
also
a
grainy
sourness
and
a
slight
caraway
spiciness
a
little
then
but
interesting
i
applaud
the
organic
comittment
of
the
brewery
and
the
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
character
i
havent
had
many
of
this
style
but
i
felt
it
didnt
quite
match
up
to
the
ayinger
comrade

good
stuff
this
beer
poured
a
dark
redtinged
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
head
the
smell
is
sweet
toasted
malt
with
some
caramel
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
caramel
sweetness
that
gives
way
to
some
nuttiness
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
while
it
isnt
anything
thats
going
to
blow
your
mind
is
still
worth
grabbing
if
you
see
a
bottle
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
could
be
a
bit
thicker
but
otherwise
worth
a
try
the
aroma
is
sweet

somewhat
sour
with
grain
hay
grass
and
herbs
the
appearance
is
deep
amber
with
an
average
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
cereal
finish
the
palate
is
thin
but
ok
overall
its
a
quality
beer
but
i
am
just
not
into
it
it
reminds
me
of
an
oktoberfest
beer

looks

with
fine

one
finger
of
foam
that
fades
into
a
skim
after
a
couple
minutes
aroma
was
a
little
funky
after
the
first
pour
but
seems
to
open
up
a
little
after
that
bready
with
mild
caramel
wood
and
tobacco
notes
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
light
and
somewhat
dry
in
the
woodsy
finish
its
not
overly
sweet
like
some
mdls
more
like
an
imperial
maerzen
or
something
body
feels
more
moderate
thanks
to
the
carbonation
overall
easy
to
drink
sort
of
hearty
halfway
to
a
doppelbock
clean
and
fairly
tasty
there
is
just
enough
complexity
here
that
i
could
drink
a
few
before
getting
bored
of
it
it
is
light
and
smooth
enough
to
be
sessionable
but
the
alcohol
starts
to
peek
through
a
bit
too
much

for

barn

ky
ultimately
for
me
it
cant
be
a
repeat
purchase
as
it
was
a
little
watery
and
the
bitterness
combined
with
the
lager
yeast
flavor
profile
just
didnt
have
enough
malt
to
carry
it
to
a
happy
place
there
are
nice
caramel
malt
notes
in
the
taste
as
well
grain
and
hints
of
chocolate
follow
with
an
ever
so
slight
bitterness
nice
sweetish
finish
all
around
a
very
good
dark
lager
o
a
case
of
a
beer
being
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
would
drink
these
over
the
course
of
the
night
tasty
and
simple
overall
a
very
fine
dark
beer
to
be
searched
for
again
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
but
more
of
a
dark
american
lager
than
a
munich
dunkel
it
lacks
some
richness
and
malt
complexity
of
the
munich
style
while
seems
to
fit
perfectly
within
the
dark
american
overall
a
tasty
dunkel
would
have
again
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
creamy
slick
and
bordering
on
watery
with
light
carbonation
a
light
body
and
an
overall
lightness
thats
just
a
tad
bit
too
bitter
to
consider
crisp
this
is
a
gem
for
any
malty
beer
fans
out
there
and
even
though
it
went
down
easy
it
would
not
be
a
session
beer
for
me
a
good
beer
overall
and
true
to
its
style
just
not
the
type
of
beer
i
would
have
all
night
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
its
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
quite
sessionable
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
a
decent
dark
euro
lager
well
balanced
and
an
easy
way
to
sip
away
the
remainder
of
christmas
day
2010
i
found
this
dunkel
drier
and
more
refreshing
than
many
others
highly
drinkable
d
i
could
stay
on
this
one
all
night
flavours
are
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
and
the
dry
finish
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
pretty
damn
good
d
a
little
bit
of
everything
that
you
could
expect
from
a
munich
dunkel
lager
definitely
a
winner
in
my
book
ill
continue
to
look
for
it
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
example
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
d
a
sessionable
brew
by
all
means
its
good
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
that
appears
to
be
almost
6
months
old
it
holds
up
pretty
well
its
gut
overall
it
is
a
fail
for
the
style
in
the
taste
department
it
pours
out
a
dark
brown
with
a
surprising
amount
of
head
for
a
dark
beer
as
the
beer
settles
there
is
little
to
no
lacing
the
smell
is
a
hint
of
barley
with
a
roasted
malt
not
a
strong
smell
the
taste
is
moslty
roasted
malt
with
not
much
added
complexity
perhaps
a
bit
of
barley
this
beer
seems
like
it
has
a
lot
of
potential
at
first
sip
but
the
lack
of
complexity
and
flavor
are
a
bit
disappointing
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
for
a
dark
beer
surprisingly
not
substantial
and
thin
feeling
in
my
mouth
while
this
beer
is
not
that
thick
and
isnt
exactly
an
assualt
on
the
palate
i
still
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
many
as
it
is
super
filling
and
sits
heavily
with
you
fairly
average
all
the
way
around
poured
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
like
furniture
stain
dark
sweet
malts
dominate
the
smell
with
little
else
in
there
flavour
is
sweet
malts
with
some
earthy
european
style
hop
bittnerss
toward
the
end
very
easy
drinking
beer
a
nice
example
of
a
style
i
enjoy
gosser
has
plenty
of
drinkability
it
has
a
creamy
mouth
feel
that
still
manages
to
be
light
there
is
a
finish
however
it
is
not
long
rather
it
lingers
more
than
one
of
this
beer
can
be
consumed
in
one
sitting
with
pleasure
it
would
be
an
excellent
fall
beer
but
can
be
enjoyed
at
any
time
this
is
a
decent
smooth
malty
beer
definitely
drinkable
drinkability
well
its
no
ayinger
altbairisch
dunkel
that
much
is
certain
ive
never
been
sure
or
interested
enough
to
find
out
how
to
pronounce
gösser
but
it
always
makes
me
think
of
gozer
the
gozerian
from
the
movie
ghosterbusters
the
beer
is
somewhat
metallic
which
always
gets
an
instant
red
card
from
me
so
i
cannot
recommend
it
in
good
faith
however
i
will
instead
cheerfully
recommend
ghostbusters
overall
impression
a
nice
sessionable
dark
lager
a
recommended
for
those
seeking
this
style
or
if
you
get
one
in
a
mixed
pack
of
imports
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
lighter
amber
along
the
bottom
and
edges
of
the
glass
one
and
one
half
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
yeast
pale
malt
and
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
dunkel
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
pale
malt
hops
yeast
and
a
general
sweetness
in
the
finish
fruit
overall
a
really
good
beer
by
far
the
best
munich
dunkel
ive
ever
had
really
smooth
good
body
great
blend
and
easy
drinkability
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
note
drank
ontap
at
the
yardhouse
in
san
diego
ca
d
gosser
dark
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
from
a
beers
of
the
world
pack
pours
dark
brown
with
a
modest
head
and
good
amount
of
lacings
aroma
is
caramel
malts
taste
is
sweet
dark
malts
and
just
enough
hops
for
the
style
a
slight
taste
of
chocolate
to
go
with
the
caramel
light
bodied
and
quite
sessionable
would
be
a
very
good
dessert
beer
without
being
very
filling
pours
a
rich
brown
color
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
creamy
tan
head
sweet
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
notes
of
mocha
and
maybe
some
hazelnut
palate
is
mainly
smooth
sweet
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
added
by
the
hops
body
is
nice
and
velvety
smooth
surprisingly
tasty
i
should
check
out
more
examples
of
this
style
when
i
bought
this
beer
i
really
didnt
think
that
i
was
going
to
like
it
little
did
i
know
that
it
is
a
solid
brew
the
beer
opens
up
with
a
dark
but
clear
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
an
unexpectly
dense
foam
stand
that
showed
great
staying
power
during
the
session
aromas
of
faint
toasted
barley
underlying
sweetness
and
an
earthy
peatet
hints
soon
followed
flavors
of
light
confectionate
sugar
emerged
first
but
eventually
balanced
by
a
pronounced
yet
soft
toasted
roasted
flavor
that
gains
intensity
into
the
finish
peat
moss
and
earthy
hops
continued
to
add
complexity
and
richness
as
well
the
beer
remained
softly
textured
and
very
smooth
throughout
with
no
astingency
or
grainy
flavors
finihses
with
a
fleeting
sweetness
leaving
only
a
hint
of
toast
and
hop
bitterness
left
on
the
toung
though
not
outstanding
the
brew
is
solid
pours
a
dark
but
clear
amber
brown
color
with
light
tan
creamy
head
that
takes
a
while
to
fade
smells
of
roasted
malt
a
little
chocolatey
you
can
taste
the
roast
malt
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
in
there
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
flavor
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
a
little
creamy
with
a
little
fizz
at
the
end
it
actually
finishes
fairly
dry
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
ill
be
getting
this
again
this
is
one
awesome
beer
pours
the
color
of
color
and
just
as
clear
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
lacing
on
my
glass
aromas
are
of
roasted
malts
typical
of
a
munich
dunkel
lager
but
not
as
rich
as
some
bavarian
examples
on
the
tongue
this
first
thing
to
come
out
is
some
light
sweetness
tinged
with
sourness
followed
by
drier
roasted
malt
notes
with
that
light
sourness
coming
back
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
brisk
carbonation
that
hits
especially
had
on
the
midpalate
overall
this
is
a
good
dunkel
lager
not
the
best
not
terribly
complex
but
decent
and
drinkable
delightful
brew
one
of
the
best
from
oesterreich
quaffable
a
bit
sweetish
but
still
balanced
satiating
without
ever
becoming
cloying
wel
done
beautiful
color
like
dark
stained
mahogany
with
ruby
not
much
head
to
speak
of
but
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
smoke
malt
a
bit
of
pumpkin
or
sweet
potato
not
very
heavy
taste
kind
of
dull
which
i
find
often
typical
of
the
style
lazy
malt
no
hops
except
for
a
slight
bittering
some
sweatsock
flavor
not
much
character
really
disappointing
mouthfeel
too
sharp
small
bubble
that
quickly
foams
in
your
mouth
robbing
you
of
the
beers
flavor
drinkability
is
ok
if
you
enjoy
the
taste
which
is
tolerable
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
dark
amber
that
looked
a
bit
like
maple
syrup
the
head
poured
about
a
half
cm
of
light
tan
smelled
of
smoky
molasses
and
caramel
with
a
sweet
peach
and
apple
fruitiness
beneath
tasted
of
very
dark
fruits
with
a
plumb
crispness
followed
by
a
raisin
and
prune
sweetness
finished
dry
with
a
sweet
and
sour
crispness
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
light
and
tingly
carbonation
drinkabilityoverall
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
dark
beer
very
nice
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
pleasant
lager
very
drinkable
certainly
worth
a
try
this
is
a
simple
clean
nononsense
hearty
dark
lager
i
found
it
to
be
a
just
tad
roastytoasty
with
a
maltyrich
mouthfilling
fullness
that
was
quite
enjoyable
it
comes
off
like
a
good
bock
with
that
kind
of
grain
profile
but
just
a
little
drier
and
toastier
i
have
not
seen
it
in
very
many
places
either
stores
or
restaurants
shich
is
a
bit
of
a
shame
also
it
can
be
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
its
worth
a
try
anyway
id
like
to
try
it
in
austria
overall
i
easily
preferred
the
gösser
dark
from
the
standard
offering
which
i
tried
earlier
a
drinkable
dark
brew
that
is
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
cost
1
69
and
goes
down
nicely
i
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
away
again
nice
enough
amber
significant
carbonation
at
ludwigs
in
philly
dry
with
a
touch
of

sourness
burnt
roast
malts
some
chocolate
but
also
syrupy
sweetness
medium
mouthfeel
from
nuts
cigar
tabacco
not
smooth
mix
didnt
work
maybe
at
some
elses
pub
or
maybe
fresh
at
the
brewery
its
not
a
brute
on
the
flavors
but
whats
there
is
a
subtle
chocolate
breadyness
mildly
peaking
interest
to
keep
going
towards
fillin
another
glass
perhaps
im
being
a
bit
more
gracious
with
my
numbers
here
but
i
do
like
what
im
getting
out
of
this
so
up
they
go
fine
fine
stuff
seems
like
being
an
obscure

i
could
drink
a
few
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
malty
dunkel
altogether
not
really
complex
but
would
make
for
a
good
beer
with
a
steak
and
potato
i
could
imagine
myself
drinking
this
while
playing
pool
for
some
reason
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
decent
size
rather
creamy
had
that
leaves
a
light
amount
of
lacearomas
of
roasted
malt
and
a
little
brown
sugerlike
sweetness
a
well
rounded
flavor
of
light
sweetness
and
some
bread
dough
with
a
light
touch
of
pepper
in
the
finish
a
pretty
easy
drinker
not
as
sweet
as
some
others
of
the
style
i
had
this
beer
awhile
back
and
thought
for
sure
i
had
reviewed
it
but
did
notthis
brew
is
alot
better
than
their
pale
lager
light
bodied
and
sparkling
in
the
mouth
similar
to
a
pils
though
at
times
this
seems
a
bit
washedout
and
dilute
flavorwise
this
isnt
particularly
memorable
but
it
is
quaffable
en
masse
i
had
this
on
tap
in
two
different
bars
in
the
western
ural
city
of
perm
in
the
heart
of
russia
it
came
out
a
deep
clear
ruby
red
under
a
two
finger
beig
head
wiht
nice
retention
and
excellent
lace
the
nose
was
pleasantly
strong
full
of
malt
and
caramel
the
mouth
was
prickly
and
mediumbodied
with
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
mild
and
mainly
caramel
wiht
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
this
was
a
good

highly
drinkable
refreshing
and
complex
not
too
sweet
yet
dark
malt
rich
with
strong

qualities
that
arent
understated
or
overbearing
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
that
is
slightly
transparent
with
a
medium
white
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
there
really
isnt
any
aroma
that
i
can
find
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
has
a
slightly
carmellike
taste
very
good
and
pretty
smooth
slightly
dry
aftertaste
good
beer
for
drinking
several
of
but
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
special
character
its
a
dark
lager
a
nice
light

that
lasts
the
whole
way
theres
some
good
amount
of
lacing
here
too
as
for
the
taste
its
got
a
nice
semichocolate
taste
also
some
roasted
malts
in
there
pretty
decent
tasting
if
you
see
it
might
as
well
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
deep
brown
color
topped
by
a
nice
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
even
after
a
couple
of
sips
also
leaves
lace
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
caramel
the
taste
consists
of
caramell
not
that
strong
though
and
chocolate

quite
impressive

with

in

a

to
the
smell
light
body
flavor
is
frontloaded
and
in
the
hazelnut
range
in
taste
finishes
light
with
a
honey
impression
certainly
not
a
lot
of
hops
going
on
flavor
is
nice
but
this
beer
is
a
little
sweet
and
fleeting
in
impression
for
me
its
ok
and
drinkable
but
whenever
ive
had
it
it
tends
to
be
a
bit
syruppy
or
something
and
seems
to
have
a
marmalade
sort
of
flavour
nice
otherwise
i
was
looking
for
a
brown
ale
and
this
was
as
close
as
my
local
store
had
mahogany
color
roasty
smell
while
drinking
it
someone
next
to
me
asked
if
anyone
else
smelled
skunk
but
it
wasnt
skunky
good
carbonation
id
buy
again
if
i
couldnt
find
other
darker
beers
better
than
the
original
but
its
still
not
good
overall

this
might
be
my
baseline
for
a
3
very
average
when
you
get
a
good
bottle
overall
its
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
particularly
special
it
weakens
as
the
drink
progresses
the
first
sips
are
the
best
it
thins
after
that
its
easily
accessible
fairly
smooth
but
better
examples
of
the
style
are
out
there
a
tad
above
average
brew
but
nothing
great
pours
brown
with
tan
head
as
others
have
said
the
head
falls
quickly
aroma
has
some
malt
faint
floral
hops
and
some
faint
roasted
smell
flavor
is
malty
with
little
hop
bitterness
some
roasted
flavor
there
too
mouthfeel
is
thin
this
isnt
bad
its
drinkable
but
it
has
too
little
flavor
and
its
too
watery
that
said
its
better
than
any
bmc
type
beer
though
this
is
a
dark
lagerit
feels
a
little
light
not
too
watery
but
lighter
than
i
expected
finish
hoppy
aftertaste
a

decent
massproduction
beer
easily
drinkable
bottom
line
plain
and
simple
not
reccomended
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
sort
of
a
below
average
beer
that
the
only
thing
that
i
could
really
note
as
a
special
feature
was
the
smell
cheers
this
is
weaker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
perhaps
it
could
work
as
a
converter
of
macro
drinkers
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
fast
fairly
mild
malt
smell
taste
was
not
bad
strong
malt
flavor
and
fairly
smooth
i
detected
some
mild
chocolate
or
molasses
type
sweetness
as
i
drank
it
but
the
overall
initial
taste
is
malt
with
some
bitterness
mouthfeel
a
bit
weak
but
disguised
by
the
flavor
this
is
a
beer
to
order
when
dining
out
and
the
selections
are
limited
not
bad
but
there
are
so
many
better
beers
sold
at
premium
prices
i
dont
see
this
as
a
sessions
beer
dry
metalic
finish
detracts
from
the
overall
experience
found
it
hard
to
finish
just
one
i
would
probably
be
upset
if
becks
started
to
try
marketing
this
as
becks
dunkel
it
just
wouldnt
be
right

its
beer
not
good
not
bad
just
beer
predictibly
dark
brown
with
typical
tan
head
retention
and
a
little
lacing
smells
a
normal
toasty
lightly
roasty
and
bready
light
sweetness
with
the
malts
relying
on
roasted
grain
to
offer
flavor
and
bittering
medium
body
with
medium
cleanliness
ordinary
and
unfortunately
borring
a
moderate
grainy
flavor
keeps
it
from
ranking
higher
for
me
becks
dark
pours
a
dark
brown
with
lighter
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
can
smell
a
little
bit
of
hops
but
its
a
fairly
mild
but
somewhat
skunky
aroma
i
can
taste
some
malt
along
with
the
hops
drinkable
but
not
particularly
interesting
pours
dark
and
bring
out
a
nice
offwhite
head
smells
slightly
of
chocolate
malt
but
mostly
it
is
very
muted
lager
smell
the
taste
is
nice
clean
unskunked
lager
with
a
slight
complementary
roasty
and
nutty
flavor
nice
medlight
body
along
with
a
low
abv
gives
this
a
six
pack
award
for
cheap
tasty
and
slammable
this
pours
out
a
deep
reddish
brown
average
head
its
looks
pretty
good
it
dosnt
attack
your
nose
with
anything
but
light
hints
of
whats
to
come
smells
sweet
a
little
funky
taste
wise
its
pretty
much
the
same
tastes
like
a
euro
lager
with
a
little
extra
malt
a
little
dark
fruit
here
and
there
and
a
touch
of
skunk
not
really
my
bag
mouthfeel
seemed
off
highly
carbonated
and
a
bit
much
not
smooth
by
any
means
overall
i
wasnt
feeling
it
decent
beer
i
guess
but
not
one
id
drink
often
opinion
i
have
drank
this
beer
quite
a
few
times
when
this
was
the
best
the
bar
i
was
at
had
on
tap
but
i
dont
remember
ever
having
one
that
was
this
rough
i
am
sure
that
i
will
try
this
beer
again
but
it
is
a
mediocre
beer
at
bestespecially
by
german
standards
this
is
very
unoffensive
very
average
very
consumable
i
dont
care
for
this
beer
wont
buy
again
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
i
could
drink
several
in
a
row
of
but
it
seems
underflavored
and
overcarbonated
for
its
darkness
and
that
is
taking
into
consideration
the
small
head
it
is
missing
the
redeeming
quality
of
becks
light
the
refreshing
taste
to
me
this
is
another
beer
that
fools
americans
with
the
concept
of
a
dark
beer
from
europe
even
though
it
doesnt
fully
fit
the
bill
smooth
finish
altogether
nothing
special
but
a
decent
drink
this
beer
pours
a
dark
color
but
is
still
clear
i
used
a
pilsner
glass
this
beer
did
not
have
much
head
and
hardly
laced
the
glass
the
smell
wasnt
that
great
not
very
hoppy
it
is
somewhat
of
a
bitter
tasting
beer
it
is
sort
of
bland
but
not
too
dry
medium
carbonation
might
be
better
with
just
a
tad
more
bubbles
very
thin
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
about
this
one
its
definately
not
on
the
top
of
the
list
for
me
but
try
it
i
guess
pours
a
dark
mahogany
but
very
clear
the
head
is
thin
in
consistency
and
hieght
and
does
not
retain
very
well
or
leave
any
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
clean
just
some
faint
toasted
dark
amber
malt
and
noble
hop
aromas
roasted
and
smoky
flavor
with
a
generous
dose
of
skunk
in
the
aftertaste
the
offflavor
turns
medicinal
and
astringent
which
will
eventually
ruin
the
finish
and
drinkability
mild
carbonation
and
a
light
body
perhaps
this
was
lightstruck
but
if
this
is
how
its
supposed
to
taste
there
is
a
gross
imbalance
of
taste
that
ruins
what
would
be
a
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
definitely
a
decent
and
nottooexpensive
dark
lager
worth
a
try
i
drank
this
because
it
was
the
best
one
or
two
choices
in
the
place
and
is
the
only
reason
i
would
drink
it
again
its
not
a

ha
i
just
had
a
gonzo
from
flying
dog
lets
see
how
a
becks
dark
holds
up
pours
a
two
finger
brown
head
thats
quickly
settling
a
crystal
clear
dark
brown
mohogeny
liquid
the
head
has
already
nearly
settled
and
is
popping
like
that
ine
cereal
smells
potently
of
tin
hops
saaz
my
nose
says
sweet
malt
way
beneath
with
searching
hey
maybe
even
a
hint
of
roast
tastes
hop
bitter
tin
hop
taste
of
saaz
some
roast
but
way
beneath
the
hops
almost
beneath
the
flavor
of
the
carbonation
upon
the
swallow
i
get
some
green
apple
which
i
think
may
come
from
the
use
of
black
patent
malt
sweet
is
the
aftertaste
but
this
is
not
a
strong
flavor
mdlight
body
which
is
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
too
carbonated
but
this
is
drinkable
and
actually
tastes
much
better
than
i
expected
this
is
also
okay
in
a
bottle
for
when
your
slumming
it
in
the
village
plus
the
nyu
coeds
will
probably
think
youre
sophisticated
for
drinking
becks
i
could
drink
this
in
a
major
pinch
it
is
better
than
most
american
bmc
only
slightly
better
though
it
has
flavor
and
not
much
of
it
is
off

it
is
what
it
is
drinkable
well
the
bottle
is
finishable
my
bottle
was
purchased
in
omaha
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
would
certainly
have
another
if
in
a
bar
that
didnt
have
a
great
selection
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
good
session
brew
overall
impression
yawn
yeah
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
guess
it
could
serve
as
a
gateway
for
macro
drinkers
i
dont
think
ill
be
back
anytime
soon
drinkability
this
beer
wasnt
terrible
there
were
some
nice
flavors
and
aromas
in
there
but
it
just
didnt
taste
complete
something
is
just
missing
not
really
worth
the
price
nose
was
slightly
malty
not
much
going
on
that
i
could
notice
not
alot
of
carbonation
and
had
a
mostly
thin
mouthfeel
taste
was
mildly
malty
with
a
slight
macro
skunk
a
hintohops
in
the
finish
6
months
ago
id
have
had
higher
praise
for
this
but
now
even
though
its
ok
id
never
feel
the
urge
to
buy
it
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
modest
puffy
head
smell
is
of
a
toasty
maltiness
with
hints
of
burnt
sugar
toasty
malt
flavor
shows
through
with
a
slight
bdry
bitterness
at
the
finish
not
a
beer
to
get
excited
about
but
better
than
the
american
macro
lagers
fills
the
glass
with
a
very
dark
color
not
quite
pitch
black
but
maybe
the
darkest
shade
of
brown
ive
ever
seen
not
much
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
of
pure
sweet
carmel
malts
not
too
strong
but
i
only
notice
that
one
characteristic
in
the
scent
surprisingly
it
tastes
very
similar
to
regular
becks
it
has
the
same
mild
skunkiness
that
i
seem
to
find
in
almost
every
german
beer
the
aftertaste
in
this
one
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
maltier
but
other
than
that
theres
not
a
lot
of
differences
in
the
taste
department
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
over
mediumbodied
very
good
feel
and
nice
drinkability
as
well
although
i
seemed
to
complain
about
this
beer
once
or
twice
it
sure
went
down
fast
slàinte
drinkability
the
slightly
unbalanced
character
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
think
with
just
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
kick
in
the
finish
this
might
be
improved
from
the
bottle
i
bought
this
bottle
because
it
has
ben
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
a
becks
poured
brown
with
off
white
head
aroma
malts
barley
malts
flavor
malts
caramel
corn
i
use
to
like
this
beer
in
my
younger
days
when
i
thought
that
drinking
a
becks
was
cool
drinkability
there
are
better
beers
out
there
there
are
worse
theres
just
nothing
special
about
this
beer
and
ill
almost
never
pick
buy
this
by
choice
give
me
warsteiner
or
spaten
any
day
overall
i
cant
really
recommend
this
beer
its
drinkable
but
doesnt
taste
great
poured
a
very
ruddy
chocolate
color
nose
was
unremarkable
head
was
only
14
of
cream
that
disappaited
quickly
tongue
was
a
balanced
bitterhoppy
difused
with
a
solid
mochalike
current
to
it
that
provided
a
very
mild
sweet
like
a
dark
chocolate
type
sweet
went
down
a
little
sharp
its
an
odd
beer
but
i
did
enjoy
it
had
these
free
at
a
work
happy
hour
so
was
only
able
to
sample
direct
from
the
bottle
was
able
to
detect
a
roasted
malt
by
sticking
my
nose
in
the
bottle
which
drew
some
puzzled
looks
from
coworkers
didnt
detect
the
ol
euro
sulfur
skunk
thank
god
actually
this
brew
was
good
tangy
maltly
and
nicely
carbonated
nothing
fantastic
but
still
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable

maybe
the
free
price
helped
but
ill
get
these
again
not
bad
but
there
is
nothing
noteworthy
about
this
beer
either
i
would
order
or
buy
this
over
a
regular
becks
a
diamond
in
the
rough
the
damp
stainless
steel
nose
and
the
lack
of
adequate
sweet
barley
malt
to
balance
out
the
bitter
hops
keeps
me
from
praising
this
offering
from
becks
drinkability
this
wouldnt
be
that
bad
of
a
session
beer
i
guess
decent
brew
taste
is
flat
and
without
depth
the
drinkability
is
good
except
it
sits
in
the
stomach
and
leaves
a
thin
residue
on
the
mouth
that
doesnt
entice
another
drink
i
dont
want
to
sip
again
also
because
it
tastes
like
seltzer
after
half
a
bottle
blech
best
aspect
of
the
beer
has
to
be
erm
mouthfeel
which
zesty
otherwise
poor
disappointed
from
the
beginning
by
paying
3
50
for
a
bottle
after
my
first
two
choices
on
the
menu
were
unavailable
better
than
an
original
becks
but
thats
not
saying
too
much
took
an
entire
dinner
to
drink
one
down
medium
hoppiness
okay
carbonation
and
lacing
not
a
huge
fan
of
munich
dunkel
lager
style
the
case
states
that
this
is
the
number
one
imported
beer
from
germany
i
didnt
expect
this
to
be
up
to
usual
german
standards
and
i
was
right
appearance
is
almost
black
head
is
light
brown
and
somewhat
creamy
smell
is
malty
with
a
bready
aroma
not
very
complex
and
somewhat
generic
taste
is
also
malty
goodenough
but
not
complex
or
special
i
could
drink
plenty
of
this
but
this
is
below
average
by
german
standards
still
this
is
way
better
than
most
imported
macros
and
those
of
the
us
pours
the
color
of
dark
cola
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
of
grassy
malt
which
has
a
slight
roasted
smell
to
them
taste
is
also
very
predictable
of
the
style
grassy
alt
slightly
nutty
roasted
malt
nothing
spectaculat
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
though
and
for
the
price
there
are
many
other
beers
and
styles
i
would
get
why
do
they
even
make
dark
euro
lagers
this
crap
is
nasty
and
so
is
hieneken
dark
it
has
got
me
thinking
what
would
budweiser
dark
taste
like
appearance
is
crap
but
its
better
looking
than
regular
becks
everything
else
about
it
is
crap
is
well
if
you
are
just
getting
started
on
your
journey
for
beer
enlightenment
i
can
see
how
you
might
like
this
if
youve
already
tried
plenty
of
great
beers

your
money

dark

black
with
a

nothing

historic
notes
many
years
agolate

a
former
miller
brewing
exec
walter
driskill
became
the
importer
for
becks
his
company
was
dribeck
driskillbecks
in
the
wasteland
of
the
70s
this
was
a
quality
choice
it
has
changed
hands
since
im
not
sure
what
i
ever
saw
in
becks
dark
its
better
than
many
of
the
other
offerings
in
bars
and
restaurants
and
it
just
might
be
my
pick
given
the
poor
overall
selection
thats
out
there
it
is
not
however
a
beer
that
ill
buy
for
the
pleasure
of
its
consumption
becks
dark
is
a
beer
that
has
intrigued
me
for
quite
some
time
ive
been
looking
and
looking
at
it
in
several
beer
stores
thinking
that
i
should
give
it
a
try
well
today
i
finally
did
unfortunately
i
was
not
particularly
impressed
becks
dark
pours
deep
brown
and
settles
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
lighttan
head
it
starts
with
a
silky
texture
and
heavy
wheat
flavor
then
it
builds
to
a
fullbodied
combination
of
oats
cream
and
spice
becks
dark
slips
off
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
very
strong
and
rather
unpleasant
aftertaste
that
coats
your
tongue
for
at
least
a
halfhour
after
the
beer
is
gone
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorites
12
ounce

dating

mollasas
in
color
off
white

some

malty
nose
with
some
chocolate
soft
chocolate
notes
on
a
malty
backbone
some
hops
come
in
late
to
balance
the
sweetness
medium
body
fairly
dull
brew
better
then
the
skunky
lighter
version
better
then
most
macros
in
a
pinch
final
opinion
ill
probably
try
it
again
to
make
sure
worth
the
price
pours
out
dark
with
some
hints
of
deep
red
a
nice
thick
almond
colored
head
appeared
but
quickly
reduced
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
was
difficult
for
me
to
place
but
seemed
to
be
a
little
fruity
or
citrus
nothing
really
stood
out
there
the
taste
is
pleasing
but
not
as
full
as
i
would
expect
from
such
a
dark
beer
it
has
malty
characteristics
and
a
nice
hop
flavor
but
not
as
expressive
as
i
would
like
it
finishes
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
but
not
as
strongly
as
i
would
expect
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
not
wonderful
i
drink
this
beer
occasionally
to
shake
things
up
nothing
to
drive
miles
and
miles
to
find
but
a
worthy
offering
if
you
like
darker
beers
i
suppose
this
is
a
beer
that
was
almost
great
but
came
up
just
a
little
short
in
most
areas
all
and
all
i
thought
this
beer
was
too
thin
but
it
was
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
at
the
lake
or
by
the
pool
a
great
summer
time
refreshing
beer
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
i
was
very
disappointed
to
say
the
least
i
have
come
to
expect
less
from
macros
but
my
hopes
were
high
when
this
one
was
tapped
for
me
true
there
are
some
notes
of
roasted
malt
and
maybe
even
some
coffeetype
sweetness
in
the
nose
which
transfer
to
the
flavor
in
some
capacity
but
i
had
trouble
getting
this
bier
down
for
some
reason
the
deep
color
was
one
redeeming
factor
but
in
the
dorld
of
dunkels
there
are
many
that
are
far
superior
becks
dark
is
highly
available
and
fairly
priced

a
bomber
i
picked
one
up
and
got
what
i
expected
the
apperance
is
dark
with
light
streaks
and
a
tan
head
that
fades
like
a
soda
pop
smell
is
roasted
malts
with
grain
fruit
tones
the
taste
was
to
fruity
for
me
tasted
like
a
watered
down
juice
not
a
beer
felt
decent
in
the
mouth
light
but
with
bounce
drinkable
if
you
dont
have
much
money
and
you
need
an
average
beer
still
much
better
out
there
nice
looking
medium
brown
almost
red
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
aroma
is
a
bit
toasty
a
bit
skunky
not
a
very
impressive
beer
but
not
at
all
offensive
a
bit
of
grainy
toasty
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
too
bad
when
i
poured
this
dark
lager
the
darkbut
slightly
translucent
appearance
and
modest
head
was
a
pleasant
surprise
could
i
have
stumbled
onto
a
quality
beer
with
widespread
availability
the
aroma
was
a
basic
mix
of
grains
and
yeasty
lager
scents
i
was
neither
turned
off
nor
impressed
the
beers
initial
burst
of
malt
flavors
tapered
quickly
into
a
yeast
phase
and
then
a
thin
and
lingering
sweetness
i
was
initially
intrigued
but
rather
put
off
by
the
completion
of
my
first
taste
the
beer
was
far
too
thin
and
watery
for
my
tastes
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
chore
to
finish
the
pint
a
tasty
brew
better
than
regular
becks
but
there
are
better
german
brews
drinkability

i
can
find
a
lot
better
examples
of
the
style
but
if
youre
in
a
grocery
store
with
a
macro
selection
and
want
something
dark
give
this
one
a
try
thin
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
buy
appearance
dark
caramel
brown
with
a
decently
frothy
tan
head
impressed
by
the
length
of
the
retention
lacing
still
lies
rather
thin
specks
aroma
european
hopping
dosage
with
cooked
veggies
and
darker
roasts
bringing
slight
caramel
notes
not
bad
taste
much
better
than
i
recall
becks
ever
tasting
with
slight
sweet
mild
chocolate
notes
and
a
hoppy
cooked
veggie
finish
not
bad
refreshing
and
flavorful
not
bad
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
but
its
not
horrible
light
to
medium
bodied
nowhere
near
as
watery
as
a
typical
american
macro
drinkability
i
could
definitely
buy
a
sixer
of
this
to
watch
a
football
game
with
has
some
flavor
and
character
therefore
not
bad
in
my
book
its
difficult
to
come
up
with
a
great
deal
to
criticize
here
at
the
same
time
theres
not
much
to
praise
either
this
is
a
massproduced
beer
that
i
would
never
be
angry
to
see
on
my
table
and
that
cannot
be
a
bad
thing
i
wish
it
were
stronger
more
complex
and
had
more
body
but
that
would
mean
that
i
would
wish
it
were
something
other
than
a
massproduced
beer
been
a
couple
years
since
i
had
one
of
these
pours
a
very
dark
brown
very
small
head
is
quickly
gone
very
little
lacing
not
much
to
the
nose
medium
body
that
seems
a
little
watery
faint
taste
of
chocolate
and
malt
with
a
slight
hop
finish
drinkability
is
helped
by
the
watered
down
sensation
maybe
thats
to
be
expected
for
this
style
but
i
liked
these
much
better
a
few
years
ago
not
a
bad
dark
lager
by
any
means
just
not
what
im
looking
for
this
beer
looks
good
in
the
glass
nice
fine
beige
bubbles
and
a
little
lace
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
from
the
bottle
but
that
goes
away
fast
leaving
a
pilsnerlike
sweet
malt
and
noble
hop
aroma
flavor
is
pleasingly
malty
and
balanced
with
sweetroasty
notes
throughout
finishes
with
roasted
malt
and
slight
bitterness
i
cant
complain
too
much
about
becks
dark
but
i
cant
rave
too
much
about
it
either
still
better
than
a
lot
of
more
standard
pale
lagers
and
definately
better
than
the
normal
becks
drink
it
if
your
options
are
thin
i
used
to
really
like
this
beer
but
back
then
there
werent
that
many
choices
still
the
beer
goes
good
with
simple
foods
like
a
mushroom
swiss
burger
on
toasted
black
bread
i
sampled
quite
a
few
of
these
during
a
wedding
this
past
weekend
pours
a
dark
charcoalbrown
color
with
a
thin
whiteish
head
aroma
is
fainlty
of
roasted
grains
and
hops
thin
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
and
a
lessthansubstantial
malt
flavor
chocolate
and
nut
are
present
but
slight
in
the
flavor
the
bottom
line
is
that
its
an
average
everyday
beer
no
real
flaws
but
nothing
special
here

the
beer
pours
a
dark
burgandy
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
typical
of
a
german
lager
there
are
a
few
small
notes
of
crystal
malts
there
is
little
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
it
seems
a
bit
light
and
watery
but
goes
down
easy
a
good
party
beer
this
was
my
favorite
beer
for
a
long
time
i
have
since
moved
on
to
a
new
style
ipa
but
i
still
have
fond
memories
of
looking
forward
to
the
motor
oil
still
a
very
good
stop
gap
beer
when
no
other
truly
exotic
brews
are
available
this
may
be
the
michelob
of
german
beers
but
it
serves
the
purpose
in
a
pinch
this
certainly
looks
like
a
dark
beer
with
a
nice
head
and
some
good
carbonation
to
match
but
thats
where
the
comparisons
end
scent
is
alright
kind
of
malty
but
not
real
strong
the
taste
is
surprising
in
the
fact
that
it
tastes
so
light
and
weak
watery
to
say
the
least
flavors
are
hiding
and
cant
come
out
i
notice
an
astringent
grainy
flavor
the
rest
are
too
scarce
to
notice
finishes
forgetably
i
dont
know
who
would
drink
this
its
not
for
the
calorie
conscience
nor
is
it
for
the
true
beer
lover
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
actually
its
more
like
a
watered
down
dark
beer
more
than
a
dark
amber
there
is
little
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistant
the
little
bit
of
aroma
is
slightly
malty
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
smooth
but
a
little
watered
down
i
found
this
beer
quite
enjoyable
even
though
its
not
too
interesting
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
dry
but
good
recommended
a
dunkel
or
dark
lager
from
becks
much
maltier
than
the
original
becks
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
nice
smooth
finish
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
lasting
head
and
subtle
mouthfeel
drinkablility
is
good
since
it
is
just
right
in
abv
worth
the
taste
and
easy
to
find
overall
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
more
forgettable
becks
pale
lager
offering
being
above
average
in
appearance
and
better
in
smell
and
taste
though
this
brew
is
still
a
bit
light
in
body
it
does
give
a
nice
malty
bready
sense
that
comes
through
in
both
departments
the
look
is
good
with
a
nicely
billowing
head
and
small
level
of
lacing
the
dark
malt
adds
a
bit
of
sensual
improvement
just
not
possible
in
the
pale
gold
version
this
beer
does
conjure
up
some
memories
of
michelob
amber
bock
but
it
is
of
higher
quality
as
far
as
macros
go
this
wont
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
but
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
this
up
every
once
in
awhile
its
very
much
like
a
coors
with
some
dark
malt
thrown
in
for
color
which
also
adds
only
a
hint
of
flavor
overall
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
bland
and
uninteresting
but
not
offensive
in
the
least
dms
came
through
a
little
on
the
finish
surprisingly
not
skunked
despite
the
green
bottle
all
in
all
a
pretty
drinkabkle
beer
which
could
be
a
lot
better
if
they
spiced
up
the
taste
a
bit
come
on
becks
take
a
chance
it
really
is
a
shame
about
this
beer
this
is
a
perfect
examble
of
a
german
dunkel
a
beer
that
really
doesnt
exist
in
the
us
its
hard
to
come
by
true
dark
lagers
that
arent
octoberfests
or
bocks
sadly
the
skunk
overshadowed
this
really
nice
complex
balanced
beer
m
the
taste
also
follows
the
traditional
becks
it
is
bitter
with
a
lot
of
malt
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
dark
matls
in
this
one
the
nice
roasty
flavor
is
almost
completely
absent
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
and
nothing
more
got
almost
no
head
out
of
this
one
despite
its
freshness
but
its
appearance
is
otherwise
nice
and
even
interesting
pours
a
dark
but
clear
brown
with
amber
highlights
when
held
to
light
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
with
yeasty
notes
tastes
sweeter
than
expected
with
a
persistent
crispness
as
well
as
malt
and
grains
crispness
creates
a
good
mouthfeel
in
this
drinkable
but
soso
dark
decent
beer
from
a
style
i
do
not
know
much
of
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
some
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
it
smells
good
with
nice
smelling
hops
the
taste
has
some
roasty
caramel
taste
that
plays
against
a
bitter
bite
nonetheless
it
goes
down
fairly
smooth
and
has
a
good
drinkability
overall
a
good
brew
that
will
probably
get
again
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
presentation
packaged
in
a
green

good
12
inch

aroma
has
a
little
bit
of
spice
to
the
malty
sweetness
not
bad

nutty
and
toasty
flavor
munichlike
lighterbodied
and
a
little
pastelike
early

impression
carries
to
the
end
finish
is
similar
to
the
start
with
a
little
drying
hop
and
a
grainy
quality
no
skunk
ok
beer
pretty
average
and
theres
so
much
more
to
explore
in
the
world
of
beerdom
than
this
one
shiny
brown
color
thin
bubbly
beige
head
not
much
to
note
smell
wise
taste
was
crisp
sweet
and
somewhat
malty
very
light
on
the
beer
flavors
much
thinner
than
i
was
hoping
for
but
about
what
i
expected
moderate
carbonation
crisp
and
tasted
fresh
no
skunkiness
factor
to
note
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
alot
of
flavor
overall
a
decent
dunkel
it
will
do
when
in
a
pinch
rather
unremarkable
brew
characteristic
is
reminiscent
of
a
standard
lager
with
some
brown
food
coloring
thrown
in
light
and
crisp
yet
lacking
in
body
that
should
be
found
in
a
dunkel
wish
i
had
something
better
available
at
my
own
wedding
a
sweet
dark
beer
a
strong
molasses
taste
make
this
a
tasty
dark
beer
foam
dissipates
quickly
but
served
cold
it
doesnt
matter
very
drinkable
as
there
is
no
bitterness
often
associated
with
darks
kind
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
but
doesnt
really
detract
from
the
experience
this
is
a
decent
beer
some
roasted
malt
taste
blends
in
nice
drinkable
but
not
complex
this
is
a
beer
macro
drinkers
will
drink
and
isnt
a
bad
idea
to
introduce
them
to
in
order
to
show
them
that
all
beer
isnt
yellow
not
terribly
bad
kinda
okay
appearance
is
nice
with
a
dark
brownamber
with
a
tan
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
smell
was
not
out
of
this
world
as
it
had
a
slight
skunk
to
it
but
hints
of
malt
were
apparent
as
well
the
taste
was
better
than
the
smell
as
it
did
not
taste
of
skunk
the
creamy
mouthfell
and
malty
taste
were
the
upside
but
the
tale
end
is
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
quite
go
with
the
initial
taste
prosit
on
my
previous
encounters
i
had
thought
as
others
had
that
this
tasted
like
regular
becks
only
dark
but
this
tasting
was
a
little
more
than
that
the
color
was
dark
ruby
with
a
shortlasting
thin
head
the
smell
was
of
sweet
malt
the
flavor
was
much
more
flavorful
than
the
aroma
let
on
the
roasted
malt
was
pleasing
but
not
complex
enough
to
consider
great
there
was
good
carbonation
but
it
was
a
little
thin
i
would
rate
this
beer
as
highly
drinkable
however
it
had
decent
flavor
and
was
light
to
drink
refreshing
mouthfeel
did
leave
something
to
be
desired
it
was
slightly
too
flat
and
watery
instead
of
comparing
this
with
more
robust
and
exotic
beers
ill
leave
it
at
this
becks
thats
dark
that
really
does
sum
it
up
dark
brown
deep
garnet
hue
and
crystal
clear
as
expected
for
a
lager
the
head
isnt
well
retained
and
settles
into
a
thin
but
tight
layer
very
husky
grainy
notes
dominate
the
aroma
and
chocolate
notes
are
perceptible
but
very
subduedmunich
malt
toastiness
is
absent
the
body
is
very
thin
for
a
dunkel
and
the
mouthfeel
borderlines
on
being
watery
malt
complexity
is
lacking
in
this
brew
light
roasted
grain
flavors
manage
to
emerge
but
nothing
else
supports
them
flavorwise
becks
dark
finishes
dry
lightly
bittersweet
and
quite
bland
becks
dark
is
to
regular
becks
as
michelob
dark
is
to
regular
michelob
medium
brown
with
reddish
hue
very
little
head
or
lace
fresh
smelling
tastes
generic
with
slight
hop
sharpness
with
a
sweet
malt
finish
feels
very
normal
and
generic
a
typical
german
macro
okay
this
is
probably
one
of
the
first
dark
beers
i
remember
having
while
having
a
darker
color
the
overall
taste
just
does
little
to
give
it
much
standing
as
a
dark
beer
becks
dark
nice
appearance
and
smells
much
better
than
the
typical
eurolager
however
the
taste
just
simply
is
not
there
it
has
a
very
weak
brown
beer
there
are
probably
thousands
of
better
dark
beers
out
there
rather
plain
hints
of
chocoa
and
a
bit
of
almond
something
about
the
smell
turned
me
off
kinda
like
stale
chocolate
you
know
when
it
loses
color
and
such
i
have
fonder
memories
of
this
beer
yep
its
a
dunkel
nope
not
a
great
one
becks
dark
is
just
another
small
beer
with
a
huge
distribution
area
notes
sadly
this
brew
turns
into
something
that
may
have
been
good
to
something
that
is
a
tad
hard
to
drink
there
are
better
dark
lagers
in
the
world
that
will
beat
this
one
time
and
time
again
nice
and
smooth
with
some
sweet
malty
flavors
on
the
tongue
just
hopped
enough
to
add
some
crispness
in
the
end
nothing
spectacular
but
solid
enough
not
to
complain
my
introduction
into
dark
beers
yet
not
heavyroasty
light
bodied
with
moderate
hopping
make
this
one
great
for
those
not
sure
about
jumping
into
the
dark
a
nice
way
to
break
into
the
world
of
dark
beers
i
was
not
that
impressed
for
a
dark
beer
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
medium
body
the
flavor
has
a
mild
malt
sweetness
and
subtle
hops
overall
not
that
bad
but
nothing
great
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
mild
malt
sweetness
and
subtle
hops
not
a
bad
beer
when
theres
limited
selection
nothing
special
though
not
worth
seeking
out
dark
with
a
flat
head
no
aromas
besides
vague
maltiness
not
all
that
impressed
i
had
it
on
tap
and
although
it
started
off
flavorful
it
quickly
faded
and
became
almost
tastless
dark
malt
it
present
and
this
beer
is
smooth
not
compelling
at
all
not
nearly
as
dark
in
flavor
as
in
color
mildly
caramel
without
much
depth
massproduced
character
but
drinkable
particularly
if
fresh
o
easy
drinker
good
for
a
few
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
try
after
having
the
dinkel
acker
pilsner
this
beer
is
similar
to
most
of
the
dunkel
beers
out
there
its
got
the
muddy
brown
color
with
little
bit
of
yellow
around
the
edges
it
had
the
aroma
of
clove
and
banana
this
beer
also
has
a
similar
flavor
to
the
pilsner
a
bit
it
is
extremely
drinkable
a
winner
d
very
drinkable
not
complex
but
not
boring
its
a
nice
lager
it
isnt
very
powerful
but
it
has
decent
flavor
poured
a
thick
oily
dark
with
little
head
smelled
and
tasted
of
chocolate
with
a
little
hint
of
coffee
it
had
a
solid
body
but
didnt
seem
too
heavy
and
was
very
drinkable
it
was
the
same
price
as
the
miller
lites
so
it
seemed
a
pretty
good
value
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
slightly
fruity
has
a
good
but
not
strong
flavor
with
mild
bitterness
feels
a
little
creamy
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
o
k
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
overall
carbonation
was
somewhat
flat
however
from
the
past
i
know
that
many
munich
dunkel
beers
are
like
that
i
personally
like
this
beer
and
cannot
wait
to
get
another
one
a
very
drinkable
beer
they
taste
and
mouthfeel
really
make
up
for
the
middle
of
the
road
appearance
clear
dark
amber
with
a
thin
collar
of
foam
that
leaves
minimal
lace
light
toasted
graininess
in
the
nose
with
faint
coffee
grounds
tastes
of
caramel
malt
chalky
cocoa
and
finishes
with
a
coffee
like
bitterness
light
bodied
and
pleasant
but
not
spectacular
a
mix
of
light
ruby
and
dark
amber
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
that
slowly
descends
into
darkness
as
you
go
from
bottom
to
top
nice
one
finger
head
after
the
pour
but
recedes
to
a
nice
film
great
bubblin
too
the
aroma
is
munich
malty
bread
and
no
real
discernable
hops
watery
heavily
toasted
and
lightly
roased
malts
ths
gives
a
little
hint
of
bread
then
some
very
faint
lemongrass
mint
evens
out
the
finish
very
smooth
watery
a
well
as
a
little
herbal
note
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
just
needs
some
more
flavor
to
make
it
a
better
german
session
beer
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
dry
side
and
has
toasty
bread
crust
leaves
hints
of
root
beer
and
cola
its
clean
snd
very
pleasant
even
somewhat
zesty
and
very
easy
to
drink
yet
but
a
bit
bland
had
it
on
tap
in
a
half
liter
glass
at
schultzys
near
the
university
of
washington
i
kinda
wish
i
had
ordered
a
whole
liter
overall
a
very
pleasant
brew
if
a
bit
too
sweet
on
the
tongue
not
recommended
for
those
not
fond
of
this
quality
in
a
beer
but
for
fans
of
dunkel
lagers
this
is
certainly
a
nice
variation
of
the
style
the
color
when
poured
in
a
glass
was
a
medium
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
no
foam
or
lace
at
all
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
a
sweet
candy
aroma
was
evident
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
coffee
not
the
intense
flavor
i
was
looking
for
but
it
still
was
a
pleasant
taste
overall
nice
quincher
on
a
hot
day
or
just
standing
around
bsing
with
the
guys
and
girls
d
wonderful
drinkability
a
dark
beer
without
the
perceived
stereotypes
as
it
should
be
id
been
dying
for
a
nice
munich
style
dunkel
and
im
happy
i
opted
for
the
da
again
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
rubycrimson
color
with
a
thin
almost
stagnant
head
the
smell
is
malt
dominate
slight
toasted
and
caramel
notes
coming
through
the
taste
is
very
similar
very
malt
forward
slightly
skunked
probably
due
to
the
green
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
and
under
carbonated
overall
a
drinkable
beer
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
wasnt
going
to
score
high
i
wouldnt
search
this
beer
out
and
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
if
offered
for
free
i
havent
had
one
of
these
for
a
while
pours
a
meddark
copper
brown
w
a
thin
offwhite
head
which
dissipates
almost
immediatly
leaving
a
decent
lacing
in
my
nonic
a
nutty
metallic
smell
a
bit
of
fig
or
some
darker
fruit
as
well
a
crisp
malty
flavor
from
the
onset
mostly
an
all
grain
bread
w
some
more
dark
fruit
undertones
a
decent
slightly
sweet
finish
w
a
bit
of
metal
in
it
as
well
a
light
dry
brew
w
a
good
amount
of
co2
letting
the
flavor
linger
a
while
a
very
drinkable
one
ive
always
thought
this
an
excellent
dunkel
d
not
a
bad
beer
too
sweet
and
colalike
imo
but
could
be
a
good
choice
for
a
summer
session
when
a
dark
beer
is
called
for
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
dunkel
lager
and
unlike
any
other
i
have
tried
i
may
revisit
it
in
the
future
d
less
complexity
than
other
dunkels
helps
it
go
down
quite
easily
and
without
much
thought
because
of
it
well
rounded
simplicity
not
terrible
i
definitely
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
at
a
party
d
i
had
close
to
48
oz
of
this
brew
tonight
before
during
and
after
dinner
and
it
really
never
hit
me
so
im
not
sure
exactly
what
the
abv
is
but
i
dont
think
its
above
5
5
or
5
9
tops
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
in
my
opinion
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
would
consider
this
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
an
opportunity
to
taste
dit
would
definitely
be
worth
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
never
heard
of
it
but
it
is
pretty
good
i
ordered
a
mug
of
this
beer
at
schnitzelhaus
a
local
german
restaurant
here
in
tampa
the
beer
was
very
dark
in
the
glass
and
actually
looked
similar
to
root
beer
with
a
small
frothy
head
it
had
a
nice
spicy
caramel
smell
with
hints
of
apple
it
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
hoppy
finish
however
the
hoppy
taste
was
not
overbearing
so
overall
it
was
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
felt
it
was
a
good
representation
of
beers
i
drank
while
in
germany
12
oz
glass
bottle
color
of
translucent
brown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
thick
light
tan
head
nose
of
sweet
malts
hint
of
bananas
black
pepper
and
some
metallic
taste
of
sweet
malts
hint
of
bananas
and
mocha
body
is
thin
but
slightly
oily
and
with
medium
to
high
carbonation

aftertaste
of
sweet
malts
hint
of
mocha
d
the
smoothness
of
this
one
makes
it
relatively
high
from
a
drinkability
perspective
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
very
well
carbonated
and
goes
down
smooth
drinkability
is
okay
if
i
liked
the
taste
more
id
be
more
inclined
to
drink
a
few
more
overall
its
alright
worth
a
try
i
would
caution
all
those
who
say
thatfor
a
beer
to
be
outstanding
it
cant
be
subtle
this
beer
is
subtle
and
extremely
smooth
sessionable
and
unassuming
for
that
it
ranks
high
to
me
and
i
drink
alot
of
dark
german
lagers
meh
this
was
an
okay
offering
tastes
and
feels
like
it
was
dumbed
down
beer
poured
a
clear
but
dark
brownish
maroon
head
was
fairly
thin
aroma
and
taste
were
of
dark
bready
malt
and
some
muted
dark
fruit
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
not
very
lively
not
too
bad
by
any
means
smelled
a
bit
skunky
poured
dark
amber
little
head
that
it
didnt
retain
thin
mouthfeel
didnt
like
this
one
very
much
i
will
try
this
one
again
based
on
how
others
on
this
site
have
rated
it
as
mine
must
have
been
spoiled
taste
was
metallic
and
bad
watered
down
caramel
color
small
light
tan
head
with
medium
sized
bubbles
smooth
malty
aroma
it
tastes
similar
to
a
bock
but
more
of
a
hop
presence
and
less
of
a
thick
and
sticky
mouthfeel
if
youre
a
maltmouth
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
for
the
price
saw
this
one
on
the
shelf
at
the
local
store
when
i
was
mixing
a
six
pack
and
decided
to
go
for
it
had
never
heard
of
it
before
but
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
dark
german
lagers
so
how
could
i
possibly
go
wrong
right
it
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
slowly
faded
to
reveal
a
decent
layer
of
lace
left
on
the
top
as
well
as
a
good
amount
left
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
visible
carbonation
was
evident
through
the
chains
of
bubbles
streaming
up
through
the
very
clear
beer
smell
was
very
unique
it
had
a
nice
burnt
sort
of
smell
with
a
definate
hint
of
caramel
and
coffe
which
really
suprised
me
it
was
so
pronounced
almost
like
a
porter
type
of
hint
in
there
the
taste
was
very
similar
lots
of
coffee
and
caramel
flavors
mixed
in
with
a
nice
earthy
grain
and
a
slightly
bitter
hopped
back
a
touch
of
chocolate
seemed
to
be
in
there
for
good
measure
very
smooth
feel
almost
silky
and
a
bit
heavier
then
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
to
be
honest
very
easy
to
drink
despite
such
rich
flavors
went
down
very
smoothly
and
i
could
easily
see
this
as
being
an
everyday
beer
overall
for
a
beer
i
had
never
heard
of
beforei
was
very
suprised
and
impressed
i
will
definatly
pick
this
one
up
again
it
was
very
unique
and
seemed
to
defy
the
style
completely
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
beige
two
finger
head
that
fades
to
just
cover
the
beer
very
faint
aromas
of
coffee
and
caramel
very
subtle
tastes
of
coffee
caramel
a
hint
of
chocolate
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
salty
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
good
taste
good
and
is
nice
and
smooth
good
session
beer
and
the
price
is
right
the
beer
was
a
dark
brown
with
a
red
tinge
and
a
very
consistent
and
fairly
abundant
white
head
aroma
was
rather
minimal
with
some
maltiness
flavor
was
very
good
not
overly
sweet
malt
but
a
very
pleasant
light
roasted
notes
mouthfeel
was
good
but
i
didnt
find
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
which
may
have
been
in
anticipation
of
the
large
meal
that
was
coming
behind
that
beer
a
classic
dark
german
lagerits
all
about
the
malts
the
beer
is
subltle
yet
rounded
toasty
but
sweet
moderate
all
the
way
around
and
equally
as
drinkable
along
with
these
favorable
attributes
no
fruitiness
low
hopping
and
ultimately
malty
still
showed
a
clean
lager
crispness
and
light
toasty
aftertaste
simply
and
pure
one
of
germanys
gems
drinkability
i
am
very
pleasantly
surprised
as
a
beer
you
can
usually
pick
up
in
the
grocery
store
i
expected
much
less
form
this
but
it
is
a
great
beer
not
sure
of
abv
but
this
may
become
a
beer
to
stock
up
on
in
my
house
the
drinkability
is
good
fresher
would
be
better
but
it
came
a
long
way
mk
drinkability
overall
rather
enjoyable
even
though
this
is
not
really
my
thing
d
it
is
pretty
good
i
like
it
much
better
than
their
cd
pils
now
subtle
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
pop
up
in
the
senses
this
one
is
an
above
average
dunkel
crisp
with
a
dry
bite
ill
have
another
but
i
wont
actively
seek
these
out
just
happened
on
a
couple
at
lukas
supercenter
bit
of
a
dry
bite
along
with
the
roasted
malt
flavor
it
drinks
a
little
like
an
irish
dry
stout
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
a
little
skunk
at
first
damn
those
green
bottles
and
then
a
little
caramel
grain
theres
a
little
more
skunk
in
the
flavor
how
unfortunate
i
wouldnt
buy
this
in
the
us
were
i
in
germany
however
id
have
my
stein
topped
off
an
ok
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
that
i
need
ever
drink
again
nothing
bad
about
it
at
all
it
is
just
i
have
drank
many
beers
that
taste
similar
and
have
no
need
to
seek
them
out
this
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
thick
persistent
head
the
smell
is
malty
and
slightly
sour
the
taste
is
malty
and
a
bit
sweet

quite
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
bright
from
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
see
enjoying
sitting
for
an
occasional
session
of
drinking
12
oz
green
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
label
it
pours
a
clear
rustbrown
color
with
light
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
leaves
light
lacing
it
smells
of
caramel
molasses
and
a
hint
of
smoke
pretty
inviting
but
not
very
aromatic
the
flavor
follows
suit
but
with
a
schlenkerlaesque
beechwood
smoke
character
light
tobacco
and
greenspicy
hops
that
leave
a
mild
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
body
and
carbonation
yet
leaves
a
short
finish
but
its
a
pleasant
quite
enjoyable
lager
that
would
make
a
great
session
beer
definitely
worth
a
try

a

a
quarter
inch
aroma
is
fairly
malty
and
slighty
sweet
some
herbal
hop
in
there
as
well
as
slight
caramel
and
bread

is
definatly
on
the

crisp
a
pretty

for
me
i
do
think
its
a
good
dunkel
though
and
definatly
worth
a
try
goes
down
quite
easily
pours
an
opaque
deep
copper
rust
color
head
is
exceptional
if
it
wasnt
for
the
weak
nose
of
the
beer
i
would
be
forced
to
delve
into
drinking
it
before
the
enormous
thick
icecream
like
head
settled
however
once
the
head
did
settle
it
was
nearly
gone
several
small
icebergs
of
thick
foam
and
a
little
belgian
lacing
is
at
that
remained
tasted
fairly
thin
with
projections
of
roasted
plums
and
malt
not
bad
and
quite
drinkable
good

for
the

superb

very
pleasant

to

very
very
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
translucent

a
fizzy

dissipates
with
a

all
dark

is

drifts
off
of
a
deep

taste
notes
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
clean
toasted

nice
beer
to
have
in
the
evening
after
a
warm
summer
day
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
am
not
going
to
have
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
i
just
want
more
flavor
this
brew
pours
a
clear
brownishruby
color
the
head
is
onefinger
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
more
like
a
doppelbock
than
a
dunkel
lager
caramel
malt
chocolate
more
caramel
the
taste
is
quite
a
bit
more
mellow
than
the
aroma
caramel
and
malt
with
a
sweet
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
very
lively
carbonation
perhaps
too
lively
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
it
might
not
be
the
best
dunkel
lager
around
but
is
certainly
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
just
too
damn
sweet
after
a
pint
im
done
but
really
everyone
should
give
this
a
try
with
sausages
its
amazing
poured
a
brown
color
with
a
small
white
dense
head
that
laced
on
the
way
down
smell
was
a
little
weak
but
there
was
a
detectable
caramelized
molasses
aroma
reminded
me
of
the
aroma
of
my
homemade
bbq
sauce
that
i
make
with
molasses
taste
was
of
burnt
sugar
taste
and
a
little
bit
astringent
and
medicinal
not
something
i
really
cared
for
had
a
heavy
mouthfeel
and
left
the
mouth
a
little
dry
with
a
small
amount
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
drinkable
im
going
to
take
some
of
this
on
my
next
road
trip
alls
i
have
to
say
this
was
a
refresing
not
too
heavy
beverage
its
on
my
get
again
list
good
stuff
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
it
came
down
to
it
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
tan
and
fizzy
two
finger
head
that
will
soon
diminish
to
very
poor
lacing
aroma
is
full
of
noble
hops
with
toasted
vienna
malt
and
ryemaybe
the
dinkelspelt
that
the
name
suggests
the
toasted
vienna
become
apparent
in
the
sweet
slightly
dextrinous
flavor
this
is
followed
by
crisp
and
earthy
german
hops
like
hallertau
and
tettanger
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
smooth
and
the
body
is
nearly
full
with
a
great
texture
finishes
mostly
clean
this
beer
has
rich
flavor
and
a
high
drinkability
with
great
mouthfeel
too
bad
its
a
rare
commodity
in
my
neighborhood
the
last
beer
of
a
german
beer
hall
tour
mixed
pack
i
received
for
christmas
the
code
l
06651
is
printed
on
the
front
label
uf
fine
but
not
round
or
full
malt
core
with
good
toasty
backbone
not
much
more
evident
though
a
good
drinker
little
in
the
finish
besides
herbal
hops
and
fading
formerly
crisp
notion
of
toast
and
cocoa
mouthfeel
falls
toward
thinner
but
the
carbonation
is
right
on
notes
good
all
around
brew
very
drinkable
man
i
really
enjoyed
this
single
i
shall
definitely
have
to
pick
up
a
sixer
sometime
fairly
drinkable
although
i
really
had
trouble
finishing
the
whole
twenty
ounces
or
so
in
my
tall
glass
a
beer
that
ill
drink
occasionally
but
will
probably
never
buy
a
sixer
of
overall
impression
very
interesting
beer
the
over
toasted
aspects
were
a
bit
much
for
me
but
i
did
enjoy
the
overall
flavor
worth
a
try
ehhh
great
for
beer
brats
but
merely
okay
on
its
own
drinkability
good
but
not
great
nice
malty
base
but
something
about
the
fruity
caramel
flavor
tastes
fake
or
sweetened
poured
3
12
oz
bottles
into
my
liter
mug
for
the
authentic
feel
pours
a
nice
head
the
dissipates
slowly
leaving
a
nice
lace
i
love
the
deep
auburn
color
of
dark
munich
and
crystal
the
smell
is
clean
and
malty
the
taste
is
also
very
clean
as
expected
and
sweet
it
also
has
a
bready
crystal
malt
flavor
not
as
dry
as
i
expected
little
aftertaste
caused
by
the
residual
sweetness
this
is
a
delicious
munich
dunkel
i
could
drink
liters
of
it
drinkability
this
is
a
very
great
example
of
a
style
i
have
much
experience
with
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
glow
when
viewed
against
a
light
source
head
is
light
brown
and
of
an
ample
size
the
aroma
is
of
dark
toasted
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
grain
smell
the
taste
is
bready
and
full
hops
provide
a
nice
balance
and
just
enough
bitterness
finish
is
the
sweetest
part
of
the
sip
but
doesnt
leave
much
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
great
this
is
easily
sessionable
fortunately
dinkel
acker
dark
is
better
than
the
average
german
dunkle
on
american
shelves
and
seems
to
be
about
a
buck
cheaper
recommended
this
beer
is
obviously
well
crafted
but
strategically
it
seems
toned
down
a
notch
a
shame
i
do
like
it
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
recommend
it
to
those
just
getting
into
more
serious
beers
i
think
these
guys
could
do
better
though
coffee
colored
to
ruby
crystal
clear
muscular
buff
head
with
fortitude
toasted
malt
nose
but
not
sickly
sweet
nice
hop
counterpoint
tasted
like
it
looked
very
malty
toasty
and
bready
not
heavy
in
the
slightest
moderate
body
a
good
mouthfull
a
perfect
balance
between
light
and
heavy
fare
a
dark
beer
that
i
felt
i
could
drink
many
of
thumbs
up
drinkability
a
great
fall
session
beer
i
would
enjoy
having
it
again
a
clear
mahogany
robe
beneath
a
short
cap
of
ivory
welcomes
you
to
this
splendid
dark
lager
the
head
retention
is
good
and
it
leaves
sheets
of
dripping
spotty
lace
about
the
glass
notes
of
toasty
and
slightly
cocoaish
malt
reel
you
in
and
the
captivating
semirich
flavor
of
its
munich
and
highkilned
malts
delivers
satisfaction
and
refreshment
its
not
particularly
complex
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
this
beers
all
about
drinkability
its
perfectly
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
accented
by
some
mild
floral
and
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
it
fades
smoothly
from
the
palate
leaving
behind
just
a
bit
of
dark
malt
and
bitterness
leaving
you
ready
for
another
sip
this
is
a
beer
you
could
quite
easily
finish
without
even
realizing
youve
emptied
your
glass
clean
concise
and
clearly
wellmade
this
dunkel
is
not
to
be
missed
pours

one

barely
off
white
head
smell
is
malty
with
caramel
and
toast
and
chocolate
flavour
is
richer
than
i
expected
with
nice
notes
of
toffee
which
are
of
a
very
light
porter
quality
rich
bread
and
burnt
sugar
with
enough
dryness
to
balance
this
brew
out
as
a
german
macro
dunkle
this
blows
warsteiner
out
of
the
water
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
nice
drinkability
is
high
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
no
more
than
the
average
brown
ale
or
some
porters
overall
this
beer
was
surprisingly
good
a
light
tasting
dunkel
that
poured
dark
with
very
brief
lasting
head
but
some
lace
hanging
around
for
a
few
swallows
i
was
most
interested
by
its
unique
aroma
could
not
pick
out
a
dominate
odor
but
it
was
totally
pleasing
that
mirrored
its
sweet
molasses
bready
and
dark
roasted
malty
taste
with
maybe
a
hint
of
maple
hops
not
very
noticable
finishes
clean
with
a
little
sweet
toasted
grain
aftertaste
but
not
cloying
taste
flattens
mid
mouth
smooth
but
left
me
wanting
more
mouthfeel
as
most
styles
do
had
this
off
tap
last
wednesday
the
beer
poured
a
rubied
brown
color
with
3
fingers
of
head
that
fall
quickly
the
nose
was
sweet
caramel
wtih
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
as
well
the
roasted
tones
come
through
much
more
prevalent
as
it
warms
the
flavor
was
nice
a
slight
chocolate
and
caramel
backed
up
a
nice
roasted
flavor
the
feel
was
moderate
to
thick
and
very
easy
drinking
overall
this
was
good
beer
in
a
style
that
usually
doesnt
do
much
for
me
ontap
poured
into
a
dinkel
acker
wally
becher
style
glass
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
light
at
first
but
gets
stronger
as
it
warms
sweet
chocolately
maltiness
dominates
the
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
more
chocolate
and
some
caramel
as
well
there
is
a
decent
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
strong
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
a
nice
solid
dark
lager
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
chestnut
body
with
a
small
tan
head
that
lasts
a
few
minutes
drops
to
a
film
and
leaves
a
wee
bit
of
patchy
lace
aroma
is
subdued
with
floral
hops
and
some
notes
of
munich
malts
which
suggest
some
roasty
chocolate
flavored
coffee
mouthfeel
is
fully
carbonated
but
surprisingly
light
bodied
taste
is
decent
good
roasted
maltiness
with
some
burnt

notes
and
a
hint
of
toffee
along
with
mild
floral
hops
bittering
finish

crisply
hoppy
with
a
burnt

aftertaste
a
very
enjoyable
dunkel
lager
with
no
flaws
and
excellent
drinkability
drinkability
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
i
like
it
for
its
maltiness
and
carbonation
but
again
id
like
a
bit
more
taste
id
recommend
this
beer
to
people
like
myself
who
are
still
relatively
new
to
the
world
of
beer
and
want
a
good
and
easy
experience
pours
a
dark
burntamber
color
with
a
nice
sticky
offwhite
head
its
got
quiet
but
notably
maltslanted
nose
bit
of
a
roasted
nutty
aroma
with
a
little
caramel
pretty
nice
fairly
sweet
with
above
average
carbonation
theres
also
a
chalkiness
to
the
feel
of
this
brew
light
to
medium
body
hops
in
the
finish
which
is
still
on
the
sweetside
of
things
overall
its
pretty
a
pretty
drinkable
tasty
brew
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
think
its
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
had
solitarily
its
fine
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
billowy
beige
head
aromas
of
munich
malts
and
accents
of
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
mild
leafy
hop
presence
tastes
rather
hoppier
than
the
average
dunkel
some
roasted
malt
sweetness
in
the
foreground
and
a
crisper
hoppier
finish
in
the
back
pretty
average
dunkel
overall
the
hops
are
nice
but
too
forceful
and
unorthodox
for
a
dunkel
lager
dont
get
me
wrong
malty
roasted
sweetness
is
the
predominant
character
in
this
beer
maybe
its
the
kind
of
hops
used
that
makes
me
think
this
dunkel
is
an
anomaly
amongst
other
german
dunkels
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
the
aroma
is
fairly
malty
and
so
is
the
flavor
this
beer
is
on
the
sweet
side
the
body
is
medium
finish
is
sweet
a
good
beer
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
i
havent
had
this
in
years
so
it
will
be
interesting
if
it
is
the
way
i
remember
it
here
goes
poured
a
carmel
color
lots
of
bubbles
surging
to
the
topinitial
head
was
nice
then
quickly
dissipated
into
nothing
smell
was
malt
and
faint
hops
taste
is
mostly
malt
hint
of
hops
a
bit
sweet
chocolate
notes
mouthfeelwas
light
a
bit
of
creaminess
on
the
tongue
drinkability
id
say
good
there
are
others
in
this
genre
that
might
be
better
but
it
definitely
beat
becks
and
st
paulie
in
my
book
not
bad
at
all
but
not
great
either
and
i
remembered
thinking
it
was
really
potent
at
one
timebah
hah
ive
come
a
long
way
baby
the
drinkability
is
a
bit
above
average
md
medium
in
mouthfeal
very
drinkable
especially
with
a
meal
little
linger
but
hop
advantage
nice
dark
amberbrown
with
a
great
deal
of
tan
foam
aroma
is
nearly
nonexistant
faintly
malty
with
a
wisp
of
hop
taste
is
bland
but
innofensive
just
enough
malt
to
register
and
enough
hop
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
there
are
better
more
drinkable
beers
out
there
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
food
or
get
a
budmillercoors
drinker
over
to
the
dark
side
as
for
me
i
could
down
quite
a
few
of
them
once
in
a
while
this
beer
poured
a
medium
brown
color
with
reddish
highlights
medium
sized
murky
tan
head
moderate
lacing
along
the
glass
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
a
doughy
undertone
taste
is
predominately
toasted
bread
with
caramel
undertones
a
little
too
sweet
the
hops
are
there
but
too
weak
the
beer
is
also
a
little
on
the
light
side
in
body
but
that
just
may
be
the
style
easy
to
drink
a
few
but
not
much
more
than
that
bc
of
the
sweetness
i
dont
know
a
whole
lot
about
munich
dunkel
lagers
but
i
do
know
what
i
like
to
be
fair
to
the
style
maybe
this
just
isnt
a
very
good
version
dinkel
acker
dark
is
okay
but
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
of
it
a
good
dunkel
even
though
i
wouldnt
have
this
everyday
the
overly
sweet
nature
of
this
beer
might
turn
some
people
off
but
for
a
good
quaffable
dunkel
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
look
from
the
bottle
this
poured
out
a
very
clear
and
clean
dark
copper
brown
color
the
aroma
is
chocolaty
and
toffee
sweet
with
a
layer
of
roasted
chestnuts
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
lightly
malted
nutty
full
of
rich
caramellike
character

and
very
drinkable

stealthy

lots
of
sweet
malty
and
bready
notes
in
the
nose
with
little
to
no
hop
to
speak
of
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
watered
down
dopplebock
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
sweet
maltiness

very
light
notes
of
chocolate
are
tasted
finishes

yet
flavorful
a
nice
nice
dark
lager
here
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
weak
but
dominated
by
pale
lager
malts
and
lager
yeast
there
is
a
small
malty
aroma
that
is
attributed
to
the
use
of
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
dry
and
malty
with
a
refreshing
finish
its
not
bad
but
not
the
best
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
it
drinks
well
and
is
a
fine

like
a
solid
dunkel
with

herbal
european
hop

taste
sweet
bready
mix
of
dark
chocolate
and

flavors
this
is

a

beer
from

aromatic
the
look

of
a
clear
or
perhaps
slightly
hazed
dark
amber
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
and
light
lacing
the
nose
is
big

the
flavor
carries
this
through
adding
in
a
bit
of
butter
the
feel
is
medium
and
quite
smooth
lingering
a
bit
in
the
back
with
adding
a
crispness
the
overall
drinkability
is
good
as
this
beer
is

the

the

nicely
this
is
not

at

its
tangy
and
dark
tasting
but
refreshing
this
is
a
good
dunkel
it
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mostly
malty
i
couldnt
detect
much
more
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
really
enjoyed
it
the
flavor
was
malty
with
a
breadlike
taste
this
beer
really
didnt
have
much
of
an
aftertaste
either
good
beer
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
color
topped
by
a
cream
colored
head
of
moderate
size
the
head
shows
good
retention
as
well
with
a
thin
layer
of
foam
sustained
for
half
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
good
dose
of
grassy
herbal
hops
to
compliment
the
caramel
and
grain
notes
not
spectacular
but
intriguing
none
the
less
the
taste
has
a
very
pronounced
roasted
caramel
malt
taste
approaching
a
good
vienna
lager
in
its
sweetness
and
flavor
profile
but
a
touch
more
restrained
a
lingering
roastiness
is
present
in
the
aftertaste
which
appears
as
soon
as
the
light
bitteress
on
the
finish
fades
the
mouthfeel
leans
towards
the
smooth
side
but
the
strength
of
the
carbonation
prevents
it
from
truly
enveloping
the
tongue
a
touch
of
harsh
grainiess
appears
mid
bottle
and
brings
a
grainy
taste
with
it
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
also
not
a
bad
experience
either
just
a
shade
better
than

definitely
worth

i
recently
served
this
beer
at
a
crossstyle
tasting
and
it
was
the
hit
of
the
nighteveryone
wanted
more
of
this
beer
it
was
on
its
game
that
night
tonight
its
barely
distinguishable
from
becks
dark
ill
grant
this
beer
a
score
in
the
middle
of
those
two
experiences
with
a
hop
of
rereviewing
it
later

dark

a

linger
to
the
end
of
the
taste
whereupon
a
little
hop
bitterness
appears
finish
is
clean
the
taste
is
much
more
restrained
than
the
appearance
would
suggest
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
although
the
excellent
head
adds
some
creaminess
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
but
it
does
not
live
up
to
its
stellar
appearance
reddish
brown
color
with
light
head
that
was
gone
real
quick
there
was
caramel
notes
in
the
aromaalong
with
perhaps
molasses
or
brown
sugar
pretty
thin
wich
made
pretty
easy
to
drinkhad
a
hint
of
berry
towards
the
end
wich
came
out
more
after
each
one
i
drank
pretty
good
german
dark
its
looks
thick
but
goes
down
quite
the
opposite
an
awesome
mouthfeel
thats
very
crisp
and
smooth
a
medium
body
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
the
aroma
presented
more
than
the
taste
the
taste
seemed
weak
with
not
a
single
distinct
flavor
a
touch
of
prunes
and
molasses
on
the
taste
leaves
a
very
dry
finish
in
the
mouth
that
lasts
for
awhile
great
carbonation
thats
almost
fizzy
like
seltzer
water
could
be
where
the
dry
mouthfeel
comes
from
no
real
alcohol
taste
detectedbut
im
sure
its
there
an
overall
good
beer
malty
sweettart
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
herbs
roasty
malt
and
a
touch
of
smoke
the
alcohol
is
a
little
raw
and
drifts
about
in
the
flavor
the
finish
touches
on
toffee
not
at
all
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
pedestrian
dark
brown
and
clear
reserved
head
thats
a
skim
after
30
seconds
or
so
pleasant
caramel
and
toffee
aromas
almost
like
a
cross
between
a
heath
bar
and
a
twix
malt
starts
big
and
deep
not
quite
as
constricted
as
some
dunkels
plenty
of
caramelized
sugar
some
sweet
chocolate
and
just
a
touch
of
molasses
taste
flattens
mid
mouth
similar
to
other
dunkels
to
my
taste
hops
are
apparent
enough
to
lend
an
ending
statement
and
prevent
cloying
but
have
no
particular
individual
characters
milk
chocolate
tones
in
the
aftertaste
pretty
drinkable
to
me
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
overall

the
bottles
drinkability
notes
nothing
earth
shattering
and
the
sweetness
would
get
to
me
after
a
couple
but
definitely
a
solid
lunch
time
brew
to
pair
up
against
a
smoked
ham
sandwich
the
beer
pours
an
eye
pleasing
clear
deep
ruby
red
with
a
pertinent
in
size
head
the
lace
in
fine
clinging
sheets
the
malt
hints
of
caramel
and
sweet
pleasant
to
sniff
dominate
nose
start
is
malt
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
top
lanky
the
finish
is
moderately
carbonated
and
the
hops
adequate
for
this
style
droughty
aftertaste
decent
enough
beer
but
not
one
that
rings
my
chimes
but
still
worth
a
sample
nonetheless
an
o
k
german
dark
beer
the
smell
is
somewhat
weak
with
a
little
chocolate
it
pours
with
very
little
head
at
first
you
get
a
cocoa
taste
which
goes
down
smooth
high
carbonation
with
a
burnt
chocolate
twang
the
finish
is
sweet
but
with
very
little
bite
i
prefer
this
to
becks
dark
but
just
barely
overall
not
bad
for
the
class
i
love
dinkel
acker
pilsner
and
buy
this
occasionally
with
reservations
still
worth
a
try

finally
succumb
to
an

mild
tart
superego
that
lightly

between

not

of

easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
i
cant
believe
this
is
only
the

review
the
germans
could
do
a
better
job
with
the
label
nondescript
block
letters
be
assured
the
beer
is
very
good
thats
what
really
matters
pretty
good
beer
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
color
the
head
is
initially
average
sized
frothy
offwhite
mostly
diminishing

is
almost
medium
with
the
mouth
feel
having
a
water
texture
and
there
is
nice
carbonation

the
aroma
has
moderate

really
just
complex
as
i
even
pull
a
touch
of
vanilla
through
after
a
few
minutes
really
nice
and
quite
full
feel
for
the
style
due
in
most
part
to
near
perfect
carbonation
this
allows
the
flavor
to
roll
across
the
palate
and
really
just
cling
to
every
ounce
of
taste
buds
you
have
caramel
bready
notes
hints
of

are
all
leading
the
charge

to
become

a

im
glad
to
see
this
one
back
as
you
dont
get
to
see
it
around
quite
as
much
as
you
used
to
this
just
has
a
firm
and
well
balanced
mix
of
hops
sweetness
and
roast
that
stayed
well
flavored
crisp
and
easy
drinking
the
whole
way
through
the
glass
at
5
you
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
and
it
pretty
much
pairs
up
nicely
with
anything
pours
a
medium
brown
with
some
red
highlightls
minimal
head
and
lacing
scent
is
mild
some
hints
of
roasted
nuts
and
pumpernickle

brings
a

mild
taste
of
fresh
bread
lightly
roasted
nuts
and
hints
of
spice
and
herbs
lighter
side
of
medium
body
very
light
and
watery
finnish
a
nice
highly
drinkable
and
flavorful
beer
an
interesting
lager
style
poured
a
rich
dark
color
not
at
all
like
a
yuengling
lager
has
a
wonderful
roasted
aroma
to
it
taste
was
liek
drinking
a
nice
black
coffee
with
hints
of
chicory
and
tannins
that
lingered
on
the
tongue
went
down
smooth
probably
would
be
a
good
session
beer
served
up
fairly
transparent
reddish
brown
with
a
slightly
tan
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
toffee
notes
in
and
as
well
as
being
slightly
toasty
with
just
a
tinge
of
herbal
hop
character
the
taste
presented
itself
as
clean
malty
and
smooth
with
most
of
the
character
coming
from
the
malts
toffee
caramel
light
toastyness
and
smooth
sweetness
very
little
hop
flavor
but
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
to
help
balance
out
the
malts
it
had
a
medium
body
that
was
slightly
chewy
and
it
left
a
bit
more
stickiness
in
my
mouth
than
i
would
have
liked
pretty
drinkable
but
i
think
the
stickiness
would
wear
on
me
eventually
well
executed
as
are
most
victory
beers
but
just
a
bit
lacking
bread
and
sweet
malt
come
through
in
the
nose
it
seems
very
robust
but
the
taste
calms
down
grainy
taste
malt
but
not
the
kind
that
tastes
bad
this
is
fresher
than
most
lagers
ive
had
no
old
sock
taste
to
it
semisweet
a
fairly
good
finish
id
have
it
again
but
would
prefer
a
pa
or
something
with
some
bite
bready
toasty
simply
liquid
bread
richly
colored
brownish
amber
with
simple
head
nose
is
again
bready
with
a
hint
or
vanilla
icing
taste
is
almost
sweet
with
toasty
and
nearly
deeper
roasted
notes
really
nice
but
little
mid
palate
and
a
meager
finish
good
mouthfeel
and
as
for
drinkability
the
growler
is
just
about
empty
a
nice
beer
that
has
no
interntions
of
being
anymore
than
its
name
quite
good

the

is
a

bad
that
victory
has
so
many
good
choices
on

d
this

push
the

the
mouthfeel
really
bores
me
in
this
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
if
i
was
dying
of
thirst
and
didnt
know
that
alcohol
would
dehydrate
me
but
id
rather
not
have
more
than
a

this

a

beer
taste
is

very
sweet
characteristics
up

the

very
drinkable
beer
victory
has
much
better
offerings
than
this
one
maybe
theres
a
reason
it
was
so
much
cheaper
than
the
others

sourness
a
wee

again
the
beer
pours
a
ruby

color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
dry

scent
there
seems
to
be
some
roasted
and
crystal
malts
here
but
the
lager
yeast
dominates
the
smell
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
grainy
pale
and
crystal

flavor
it
is
sweet
and
a
bit
toasted
with
a
nice

balance
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
dark
lager
but
nothing
special
i
expected
something
better
from
victory
dn
decent
beer
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
lacks
oomph
while
i
usually
enjoy
beers
for
their
complexity
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
in
its
simplicity
it
is
what
it
is
and
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
else
i
could
see
a
iced
cooler
of
these
for
bas
to
just
relax
not
think
too
much
about
beer
and
just
enjoy
victory
dark
lager
will
you
marry
me
damn
good
session
beer
i
have
never
been
a
lager
fan
at
all
despise
those
parties
you
get
stuck
at
where
there
is
a
choice
of
cans
or
lager
only
that
is
why
i
started
toting
my
own
but
i
really
have
been
enjoying
the
dark
lagers
and
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
been
kicking
these
back
as
drinkers
and
with
meals
too
bad
it
is
limited
edition
this
is
a
beer
worth
looking
for
and
i
dont
really
understand
why
it
doesnt
prompt
a
little
more
talk
except
for
the
fact
that
it
is
a
lager
and
not
a
strong
or
hoppy
one
well
made
delicious
and
not
heavy
it
is
an
exceptional
seasonal
dark
red
pour
with
slightly
brown
head
that
dissipates
with
little
lacing
smell
is
nutty
and
toasty
with
dark
malt
scents
maybe
a
small
scent
of
corn
is
in
there
as
well
taste
is
similarly
malty
as
the
name
would
imply
and
lots
of
roasty
malts
mouthfeel
is
maybe
a
little
thin
but
theres
a
nice
malty
finish
thats
certainly
pleasant
not
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
and
not
the
best
victory
ive
ever
had
but
its
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
nonetheless
certainly
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
a
nice
medium
brown
with
an
ok
head
its
not
really
much
to
look
at
but
it
does
have
some
redeeming
qualities
in
the
flavor
such
as
a
slight
nuttiness
and
a
light
sweetness
has
a
bit
of
hop
kick
as
well
that
keeps
it
interesting
to
drink
too
syrupy
sweet
and
then
too
dry
i
sadly
did
not
finish
the
growler
but
ill
use
the
rest
for
cooking
a
demiglace
never
thought
id
feel
this
way
about
a
victory
beer
if
you
cant
say
anything
nice
dont
say
much
at
all
so
ill
end
it
now
while
im
not
a
big
fan
of
most
lagers
i
always
have
high
hopes
for
victory
products
i
have
to
admit
this
fell
short
it
was
only
average
granted
many
breweries
products
ive
sampled
rarely
reach
this
level
but
usually
victory
can
do
so
much
better
its
a
drinkable
beer
thats
for
sure
but
it
just
lacks
any
bit
of
complexity
this
poured
a
beautiful
dark
mahogany
color
with
little
head
and
barely
any
lacing
the
smell
was
of
toasted
malt
and
honey
the
taste
was
toastedroasted
sweet
malt
smokiness
and
chocolate
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
hops
everything
about
this
brew
was
subdued
and
the
hops
barely
showed
up
but
im
guessing
this
is
very
close
to
the
true
style
of
a
dunkel
dark
lager
this
is
a
little
mellow
for
a
victory
brew
but
like
i
said
its
probably
true
to
the
style
this
is
my
first
true
dunkel
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
a
medium
low
abv
and
not
too
filling
dont
let
the
color
fool
you
very
fitting
for
the
transition
from
late
winter
into
the
early
spring
season
i
think
ill
have
another
well
the
2004
dark
dunkel
lager
is
on
draft
at
the
victory
brewpub
i
love
these
guys
ron
bill
because
they
are
always
teaking
and
seeking
their
idea
of
the
perfect
expectation
of
the
beer
they
have
andor
are
brewing
this
years
very
version
has
a
rich
dark
mahogany
hue
with
a
small
offwhite
head
there
is
slight
almost
indistinquishable
aroma
but
the
roasted
malt
taste
is
noticable
not
smokey
or
peat
flavor
the
medium
carbination
provides
a
smooth
mouthful
the
hops
are
in
the
background
but
there
is
a
delicate
delicious
but
not
overwhelming
malt
finish
a
classic
session
brew
hope
you
all
have
an
opportunity
to
try
it
pours
a
clear
dark
caramel
color
topped
by
a
medium
tan
head
strong
caramel
aromas
backed
by
a
touch
of
nobletype
hops
on
the
aroma
the
taste
is
very
high
on
biscuity
roasted
malt
with
a
nice
caramel
note
as
well
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
leads
to
a
long
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
of
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
great
with
fine
carbonation
supporting
the
smooth
malt
body
drinkability
is
also
very
good
as
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
that
you
would
not
likely
grow
tired
of
very
quickly
a
very
nice
beer
from
victory
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
dark
ruby
brown
with
an
beige
head
that
manages
to
stick
around
some
clean
roasted
european
malts
on
the
nose
dark
roasted
carmely
malted
taste
balanced
well
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
a
good
well
crafted
dark
lager
that
achieves
exactly
what
it
strives
to
be
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
though
a
solid
offering
deep
brown
with
orange
hues
and
an
offwhite
head
aromas
of
nuts
malts
and
cinnamon
flavor
is
much
the
same
but
strikes
a
much
better
balance
in
flavor
than
it
does
in
smell
theres
a
little
bit
of
sourness
in
there
but
its
hardly
noticeable
body
is
slightly
heavy
and
carbonation
is
light
and
it
carries
a
good
feeling
on
the
tongue
its
a
little
nutty
an
odd
tasting
but
i
dont
see
this
offerings
as
flavorful
or
as
exciting
as
other
beers
by
victory
deep
amber
color
slight
nutmalt
nose
rich
sweet
malt
notes
in
the
taste
but
there
it
ends
rich
white
head
it
is
quite
rich
and
sweet
for
a
lager
beer
but
it
seems
something
is
missing
in
there
to
round
out
this
sweetness
it
is
good
but
for
victory
good
is
an
underachievement
i
guess
the
world
is
tough
when
you
make
such
darn
good
products
the
dark
lager
is
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
puts
it
over
the
top
pretty
well
balanced
brew
nothing
spectacular
and
there
isnt
one
great
characteristic
that
stands
out
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
has
a
ruby
colored
body
with
a
very
short
head
very
malty
aroma
a
mild
bitterness
balanced
with
the
strong
malty
flavors
keeps
it
well
balanced
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
find
their
way
in
as
well
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
a
nice
easy
drinker
the
body
is

with
decent
carbonation
on
the

the
flavor
has
good
balance
between
the
toasty
malts
and
some

prosit
i
love
victorys
all
malt
lager
so
i
ran
into
the
dunkel
had
to
pick
it
up
with
a
lot
of
victorys
brews
being
a
little
over
the
top
its
really
a
treat
to
be
dealt
a
beer
that
has
the
main
goal
of
being
really
drinkable
appears
a
deep
brown
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
forms
to
the
edge
of
the
glass
to
leave
a
trickled
lace
around
as
the
i
empty
it
the
hops
make
up
the
backbone
of
the
aroma
with
the
darker
roasts
and
maybe
some
caramel
malted
barley
complementing
the
mellow
floral
hoppiness
bringing
the
is
beer
to
equilibrium
in
the
aromatics
flavor
is
crisp
mellowed
sweetness
with
a
great
balance
of
hop
bitterness
and
rough
darker
roasts
bring
about
a
creamy
mouthfeel
to
form
a
medium
to
light
bodied
amazingly
drinkable
beer
well
made
and
fine
tuned
to
bring
about
the
balance
of
everything
going
on
in
this
great
present
from
victory
when
i
think
of
victory
i
usually
dont
think
of
session
beers
the
dark
lager
fits
this
category
very
nice
dark
amber
appearance
with
a
wisp
of
a
head
not
much
in
the
nose
smooth
exceptionally
clean
malt
and
grain
a
touch
of
caramel
and
some
background
roastiness
hops
are
subtle
just
there
to
balance
the
sweetness
not
to
be
in
the
fore
as
with
their
other
beers
victory
achieves
what
it
set
out
to
do
produce
a
brew
true
to
style
which
this
clean
lager
is
but
as
an
ale
guy
give
me
some
fusels
phenols
and
esters
the
all
malt
dark
lager
is
victorys
late
winterearly
spring
seasonal
released
in
january
it
pours
a
clear
deep
mahogany
with
a
reddish
cast
and
ruby
highlights
the
short
but
creamy
tan
head
drops
readily
but
keeps
a
creamy
collar
and
leaves
some
spotty
lace
the
nose
expresses
fresh
toasty
malts
with
some
mild
spicy
hops
deep
in
the
background
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
gently
caresses
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
delicately
balanced
between
a
supple
gently
toasty
malt
and
an
underlying
bitterness
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
a
touch
of
residual
toasted
maltiness
very
nicely
done
this
one
is
all
about
balance
and
drinkability
it
has
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
but
also
just
enough
so
that
it
remains
highly
drinkable
well
worth
trying
it
goes
great
with
crazy
richards
all
natural
peanut
butter
a
late
night
pairing
that
may
have
added
a
few
pounds
to
me
this
is
a
beer
that
is
better
fresh
so
i
dont
recommend
stocking
up
on
it
fresh
its
one
of
my
favorites
the
several
month
old
ones
arent
jazzing
me
as
much
average
allaround
very
good
in
a
frosted
pilsner
glass
disappointing
flavor
im
looking
for
a
nice
round
feel
and
rich
clean
malty
flavors
and
im
not
getting
it
the
feel
isnt
too
bad
but
the
flavor
is
far
too
bitter
and
lemony
skunky
everything
starts
out
well
there
is
a
brief
toffee
note
up
front
but
lemony
notes
take
over
and
really
destroy
the
flavor
not
sure
how
this
beer
has
such
a
nice
nose
but
such
a
subpar
taste
perhaps
my
palate
isnt
clear
or
something
i
might
have
to
try
this
one
again
sometime
just
to
make
sure
im
being
fair
smooth
malty
goodness
thats
a
great
anytime
beer
im
a
big
fan
always
up
for
a
good
dunkel
and
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
higher
apv
goes
down
easy
i
could
drink
about
a
million
of
these
decent
session
lager
a
bit
thin
but
still
enjoyable
warstiners
pilsner
has
a
very
similar
flavor
but
of
course
lighter
and
more
pilsnery
i
far
prefer
the
dunkel
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
dunkels
i
guess
even
the
germans
can
make
shitty
beer
great
taste
and
smooth
dark
beer
underated
good
beer
not
easy
to
get
here
dark
dull
color
vague
hints
of
chocolate
here
and
there
the
beer
was
begging
me
to
eat
something
with
it
but
i
didnt
have
anything
so
it
took
away
from
my
enjoyment
of
it
were
this
paired
with
bratwurst
a
burger
or
something
similar
i
think
it
would
be
a
4
good
taste
lower
abc
than
desired
overall
i
am
definitely
a
convert
to
the
dunkel
warsteiner
knows
how
to
make
a
good
solid
brew
i
have
a
case
of
this
stuff
at
home
along
with
the
warsteiner
oktoberfest
i
just
bought
i
am
definitely
satisfied
with
this
and
will
give
it
a
prominent
spot
in
my
fridge
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
a
above
average
example
of
the
style
its
just
a
good
tasting
dunkel
and
its
just
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
german
dunkel
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
just
slightly
creamy
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
and
it
seems
like
a
fitting
beer
for
the
fall
season
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
its
got
everything
that
i
look
for
in
a
good
example
of
the
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
but
almost
every
aspect
could
have
been
just
slightly
better
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
dunkel
and
i
think
its
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
likes
the
style
all
in
all
i
still
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
seemed
to
be
pretty
much
just
how
i
remember
it
i
havent
tried
any
other
beers
from
this
brewery
but
im
on
the
look
out
for
them
since
this
one
made
for
a
good
first
impression
i
still
think
that
this
is
my
favorite
german
made
dunkel
good
job
guys
this
was
one
nice
dunkel
keep
up
the
solid
work
pint
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
brew
arrived
a
flat
chestnut
brown
hue
with
a
light
smattering
of
tan
head
little
head
retention
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
sweetness
in
approximately
equal
measure
milk
chocolate
raisins
and
weak
coffee
with
a
faint
whiff
of
citrus
on
the
palate
fails
to
overwhelm
but
does
deliver
more
low
key
dark
malt
flavors
with
wellrounded
corners
nothing
harsh
or
pointed
some
brown
spice
and
dry
pepper
accompany
the
raisin
and
dry
cacao
from
the
nose
some
diacetyl
and
perhaps
dms
in
there
to
provide
a
light
lager
vibe
rather
thin
bodied
yet
moderately
carbonated
retains
a
smooth
drinkability
i
suppose
this
would
be
a
great
starter
dark
lager
for
a
newbie
but
most
will
quickly
graduate
to
more
robust
flavors
pours
clear
dark
chocolate
coloring
smooth
full
flavor
with
a
slight
maltiness
i
dont
know
if
it
was
just
mine
but
it
tastes
like
metal
deep
brownish
color
see
through
aroma
is
mild
with
some
spicy
sweetness
taste
has
a
bite
but
not
a
bad
one
spice
and
some
malt
sweetness
comes
through
it
has
a
clean
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
after
bitterness
overall
this
beer
seems
to
be
pretty
well
balanced
and
good
meh
great
dark
beer
disappointingly
light
in
flavor
malt
is
so
faint
its
almost
like
drinking
water
o
a
decent
dunkel
very
simple
and
straightforward
in
terms
of
going
straight
from
the
aroma
into
the
flavor
profile
nothing
amazing
or
complex
here
just
straight
and
simple
3

good
beer
dark
beer
especially
with
a
salty
type
of
snack
taste
and
mouthfeel
save
this
one
but
i
prefer
their
original
better
decent
representation
of
a
dunkel
but
there
are
better
dunkels
out
there
pours
a
dark
medium
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
a
decent
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
some
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
raisins
taste
is
light
bodied
with
the
above
flavors
coming
together
which
leaves
a
slightly
dry
finish
goes
down
easy
and
with
perfect
carbonation
a
really
good
german
brew
that
is
for
a
cheap
price
actually
much
better
than
the
regular
warsteiner
excellent
beer
generally
available
at
only
24
per
case
a
heck
of
a
nice
deal
versus
many
other
beers
that
cost
3240
per
case
even
better
on
tap
at
a
nice
german
place
nearby
newportville
inn
their
food
is
just
great
especially
the
homemade
mustard
turtle
soup
and
meatballs
with
spatzle
overall
not
great
but
a
very
decent
dunkel
overall
pretty
good
beer
not
a
ton
to
it
but
its
a
session
beer
need
to
grab
another
one
to
find
out
if
it
was
light
struck
or
if
im
losing
my
mind
it
has
a
feel
like
that
of
a
saison
and
the
color
of
a
pale
ale
at
first
it
reminded
me
of
wheat
beers
and
hefeweizen
beers
but
the
slightly
astringent
and
dry
aftertaste
were
similar
to
the
springstreet
saison
from
avondale
brewery
this
would
be
great
with
a
light
tasting
baked
appetizer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
a
unique
offering
that
seemed
like
their
normal
pils
but
with
some
toffee
added
no
big
thrills
an
average
dunkel
but
still
pleasant
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
fair
head
and
bits
of
lacing
aroma
of
malt
some
grain
caramel
bit
of
fruit
and
hint
of
chocolate
taste
of
malt
some
fruit
sweetness
with
caramel
nutty
and
touch
of
chocolate
mild
bitterness
and
a
clean
finish
moderate
body
smooth
and
nicely
balanced
easy
drinker
for
sure
one
thing
it
is
balanced
not
too
dark
a
pinch
of
spice
a
malty
sweet
note
here
and
there
and
super
easy
to
drink
had
this
in
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
reddishbrown
you
get
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
in
the
smell
also
kind
of
get
a
caramel
smell
the
taste
follows
up
with
the
smell
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
very
smooth
and
light
body
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
overall
not
a
bad
beer
was
looking
for
maybe
a
more
thicker
malt
taste
not
bad
though
o
not
sure
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
however
i
did
wish
it
had
more
of
a
presence
in
the
mouth
but
for
a
dark
beer
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
with
a
much
lighter
taste
than
expected
its
an
outstanding
beer
o
overall
this
was
meh
it
was
not
horrendous
but
not
that
good
either
so
bubbly
and
carbonated
you
cant
taste
anything
feels
like
drinking
tonic
water
oh
well
to
each
his
own
note
for
some
reason
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
a
lot
more
straight
out
of
the
bottle
as
opposed
to
poured
in
a
glass
final
thoughts
all
around
a
good
performance
i
really
wish
dunkel
beer
was
more
common
then
it
is
but
i
guess
so
many
people
have
over
roasted
the
malt
on
dunkel
beer
that
the
mundane
straw
lager
holds
swap
thumbs
up
on
this
one
people
on
this
website
seem
not
to
like
dark
lagers
at
all
much
less
this
particular
brew
id
heartily
disagree
if
you
want
a
beer
with
more
complexity
than
a
lager
typically
offers
but
dont
want
to
lose
the
crisp
refreshing
feel
try
this
beer
im
not
one
for
lagers
and
love
the
characteristics
of
a
stout
this
beer
however
really
impressed
me
its
like
michael
bays
best
movies
his
bad
stuff
is
really
bad
so
when
he
does
succeed
you
want
to
tell
everyone
hey
he
is
talented
just
look
at
this
one
of
my
top
5
commercial
favorites
i
highly
recommend
this
to
you
its
interesting
to
note
that
this
beer
is
actually
not
sold
in
germany
this
is
an
american
dark
lager
not
that
it
matters
to
me
i
have
also
had
this
from
the
tap
at
my
local
bier
house
and
it
tastes
just
as
good
there
although
not
as
cold
because
of
their
system
i
dont
quite
understand
the
lower
scoresreviews
for
this
beer
too
many
bitter
hop
nazis
on
here
well
the
aroma
was
awesome
and
thats
pretty
much
all
i
have
to
say
about
that
quite
a
let
down
on
the
palate
with
some
strange
offflavors
that
hindered
an
already
unimpressive
flavor
profile
minerals
chalk
heavy
butter
without
those
this
beer
would
have
been
okay
as
is
its
floating
right
around
medicore
not
so
bad
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
but
id
definitely
never
order
one
again
on
my
own
unless
it
was
a
candle
pours
like
your
typical
dunkel
middle
brown
with
a
off
white
head
i
think
this
beer
is
a
little
underrated
lots
of
people
have
tried
this
in
the
past
and
simply
never
go
back
this
was
a
staple
in
my
rotation
when
i
first
got
into
beer
and
now
comin
back
to
it
i
must
say
it
holds
up
better
then
most
bold
flavors
for
a
dunkel
yet
still
very
easy
to
drink
you
can
get
this
beer
everywhere
even
most
gas
stations
carry
it
add
to
that
the
low
price
for
a
12pack
i
can
get
it
around
me
for
10
bucksper
12
solid
o
better
than
expected
and
the

is

overall
a
good
dunkel
overall
good
to
have
a
german
beer
at
a
german
place
but
not
the
best
one
that
i
have
ever
had
could
use
less
sweetness
and
more
balance
overall
decent
enough
but
nothing
special
a
little
more
body
and
flavor
would
do
this
beer
some
justice
serving
type
on
bottle
and
ive
had
it
on
tap
before
one
of
my
favorite
americangerman
beers
i
had
no
problem
polishing
off
a
liter
of
this
a
well
made
dunkel
lager
nice
light
but
the
dark
malt
gives
it
some
extra
flavor
heft
overall
it
is
drinkable
sessionable
and
enjoyable
not
the
greatest
for
the
style
but
the
greatest
for
the
style
ive
had
today
overall
just
a
nice
easy
drinker
this
dunkel
a
good
session
beer
with
a
low
abv
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to

of

and
a
hint
of
chocolate
against
a
bready
and

easy
to

but
really
nothing

overall
a
pretty
good
brew
with
some
nice

roasted
flavors
while
tasty
it
maintains
a
fairly
high
level
of
drinkability
not
too
shabby
d
fine
as
a
dunkel
good
whenever
dark
beer
not
special
o
not
bad
but
not
something
ill
look
for
again
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
too
much
burnt
presence
and
really
no
sweetness
that
stands
out
i
had
to
search
too
hard
for
the

are

it
was
very
welcome
and
very
tasty
miss
these
german
beers
theyve
always
been
my
favorite
miss
old
world
too
always
has
been
a
kind
of
second
home
for
me
but
the
wife
and
kids
were
in
tow
so
i
couldnt
satisfy
all
my
desires
great
place
to
have
a
beer
great
atmosphere
very
nice
beer
even
if
it
is
one
of
germanys
commercial
brews
budweiser
vs
warsteiner
take
the
german
commercial
brew
any
and
every

o
interesting
and
satisfying
dark
beer
from
germany
with
balance
of

and

it

sweet
at
times
this
brew
is
medium
in
body
and
moderate
in
carbonation
overall
i
liked
the
appearance
but
everything
dropped
from
there
down
to
the
very
disappointing
mouthfeel
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
something
that
i
would
buy
again
o
makes
me
want
to
search
out
a
better
example
of
the
style
but
i
would
drink
it
again
under
the
right
circumstances
it
seems
a
bit
too
efficient
as
in
mass
produced
keep
in
mind
this
is
a
moderately
priced
beer
especially
for
an
import
it
would
be
a
nice
choice
for
a
darker
beer
on
a
warm
day
o
not
bad
seemed
the
best
choice
of
the
beers
available
but
nothing
outstanding
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
being
mass
produced
malt
complexion
is
welcomed
would
prefer
this
beer
even
more
if
it
has
slightly
more
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
flavorful
beer
its
refreshing
and
quaffable
i
think
a
little
more
body
and
a
little
carbonation
would
help
this
out
but
otherwise
its
an
overall
decent
beer
presentation
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
in
to
a

glass
notes
went
into
my
favorite
bottle
shop
for
warsteiner
premium
verum
german
pilsner
found
it
and
checked
a
bottle
for
a
freshness
date
turned
out
the
brew
should
have
been
drank
by
sept
2011
apparently
nobody
drinks
the
stuff
around
here
then
i
saw
another
row
of
the
brew
right
next
to
the
bottle
i
picked
up
and
checked
the
dates
warsteiner
premium
verum
good
til
august
2012
or
so
i
thought
got
home
poured
a
bottle
into
my
chalice
glass
and
was
very
surprised
by
the
dark
color
the
moral
of
the
story
is
double
check
labels
and
dont
pull
a
mom
late
90searly
2000s
reference
to
loving
mothers
and
their
attempts
to
buy
regular
potato
chips
and
other
junk
food
but
due
to
the
constantly
rushed
nature
of
the
housewife
lifestyle
bring
home
reduced
fat
or
low
sodium
bastardizations
of
name
brands
tastes
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
and
an
almost
burnt
finish
i
also
get
a
little
flash
of
fruit
in
the
malts
overall
not
bad
but
lacking
complexity
o
not
bad
though
a
bit
lighter
than
id
hoped
o
just
an
ok
beer
nothing
wows
me
way
better
dunkels
out
there
for
the
price
worth
a
try
none
the
less
a
good
but
very
simple
beer
overall
it
is
a
solid
german
o
so
so
it
feels
like
a
mass
produced
dark
beer
like
the
bud
light
of
dark
beers
poured
a
dark
brown
colour
with
a
good
head
smells
of
dark
fruits
honey
and
caramel
taste
is
of
caramel
with
a
honey
finish
the
finish
is
clean
and
warm
with
medium
carbonation
okay
mouthfeel
but
is
almoat
soda
like
i
will
have
at
least
one
of
these
in
my
fridge
for
a
nice
winter
night
a
schwarzbier
through
and
through
pours
a
foamy
dark
brown
thin
color
with
a
nice
white
head
an
inch
or
two
high
smells
malty
and
a
bit
roasty
with
some
notes
of
caramel
and
black
licorice
but
only
gently
mouthfeel
is
average
too
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
some
nice
complexity
in
the
finish
i
wasnt
wowed
here
a
sessionable
darker
munchen
style
brew
malty
and
boring
in
many
ways
eh
o
decent
dark
lager
with
clear
european
roots
with
the
yeast
and
malt
choices
dark
complex
and
fun
yet
not
filling
average
dunkel
overall
not
a
bad
session
beer
and
tasty
enough
but
dont
expect
an
ayinger
altbairisch
dunkel
quality
appropriately
priced
for
its
quality
and
good
to
grab
in
a
pinch
when
more
expensive
selections
are
out
of
the
question
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
metallic
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
slight
nutty
flavors
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
got
in
a
sampler
pack
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
on
my
own
overall
sweet
and
creamy
thats
how
id
describe
this
beer
this
is
a
relatively
bland
dark
lager
one
that
could
be
used
as
a
session
beer
while
its
not
bad
it
makes
no
demands
on
the
palate
and
does
nothing
earth
shattering
if
its
there
and
its
cheap
go
for
it
but
theres
no
need
to
seek
this
out
its
medium
bodied
with
fair
carbonation
and
a
slight
chalky
feel
but
fairly
refreshing
a
solid
offering
for
the
style
though
not
my
favorite
choice
in
styles
poured
from
a
330
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
by
jan
12
this
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
the
smells
are
mostly
of
malts
toffee
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
higher
malt
content
nice
toffee
flavor
low
hops
nice
plenty
o
new
stuff
for
me
at
this
bliss
tasting
this
one
pours
a
clear
cola
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
lighttan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
caramel
and
very
light
toasted
white
bread
thats
about
it
frankly
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
equal
intensity
or
lack
thereof
really
with
the
added
benefit
of
some
light
hard
water
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
standard
dark
euro
lager
regardless
of
city
of
originstyle
nothing
offensive
nothing
to
really
smile
about
definition
of
a
slightly
positive
meh
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
im
not
sure
i
would
ever
seek
it
out
again
but
if
sweeter
porters
or
stouts
are
the
drink
of
choice
you
could
do
worse
than
this
overall
3
5
above
average
beer
this
dunkel
is
light
in
alcohol
4
9
abv
and
is
also
light
and
dry
in
taste
would
make
a
good
session
beer
or
an
excellent
partner
to
food
there
is
nothing
remarkably
good
or
remarkably
bad
about
this
beer
and
in
todays
beer
world
thats
not
really
a
bad
thing
o
the
fact
that
it
reminds
me
of
cereal
from
my
childhood
makes
it
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
tasty
beer
for
any
day
overall
one
of
my
favorite
dunkels
robust
and
very
sessionable
prosit
russet
brown
with
poor
head
retention
has
it
looking
like
cola
after
mere
seconds
in
the
glass
things
improve
from
there
however
with
a
firm
doughiness
with
an
edge
of
burnt
toast
some
grape
skin
and
hop
leaf
add
depth
with
some
caramel
sweetness
on
the
finish
solid
dunkel
and
since
its
a
3
special
at
the
pub
this
month
i
may
have
one
more
poured
an
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
looked
like
coke
very
deep
caramel
color
with
a
head
that
didnt
stick
around
long
smelled
a
bit
metallic
for
the
first
half
of
the
glass
but
overall
i
dont
think
it
made
a
huge
impact
on
the
taste
of
the
beer
the
taste
wasnt
all
that
impressive
wasnt
bad
though
aftertaste
was
a
light
caramel
flavor
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
mouth
feel
and
taste
were
alright
to
begin
with
but
by
the
end
it
was
almost
like
i
was
drinking
malt
liquor
not
to
say
that
i
would
bash
malt
liquor
i
mean
i
grew
up
on
it
in
high
school
but
if
i
buy
a
german
dunkel
and
thats
what
im
expecting
i
dont
want
to
suddenly
be
drinking
colt
45
overall
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
complain
about
with
this
guy
but
i
might
not
buy
it
again
rjt
served
in
a
robust
glass
mug
this
beer
poured
a
clear
cola
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
receded
to
almost
nothing
after
a
minute
or
so
nutty
aroma
malty
and
not
too
heavy
at
that
and
an
underlying
fruitiness
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
with
toasted
malts
nuts
a
definite
note
of
indistinct
fruit
in
the
background
all
lightly
hopped
a
little
on
the
watery
side
mediumbodied
and
fairly
drinkable
its
a
decent
dark
lager
not
one
of
my
favourites
but
its
never
been
a
favourite
style
of
mine
either
this
is
an
interesting
beer
deceptively
light
on
first
blush
it
took
me
a
while
to
realize
this
is
a
dark
lager
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
due
to
the
trademark
tangy
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
breath
of
fresh
air
from
the
normal
hoppy
craft
brew
im
used
to
overall
not
bad
just
nothing
really
to
it
not
objectable
by
any
means
very
forgettable
beer
not
the
most
drinkable
in
my
opinion
however
it
seems
to
cater
to
the
more
advanced
beer
drinker
someone
looking
for
a
complex
german
dark
lager
unfortunately
those
styles
seem
to
be
a
dying
breed
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
o
for
a
cheap
beer
its
pretty
good
sure
there
are
better
dunkels
out
there
but
for
the
price
it
cant
be
beat
worth
checking
out
sometime
had
on
tap
at
the
platt
in
franlin
square
at
the
umternational
talkbass
annual
get
together
showed
up
in
a
mug
nice
purple
brown
with
a
thin
foamy
head
that
was
gonelun
munutes
nutty
roasted
malt
not
the
best
a
big
lagery
taste
follows
the
nose
but
more
grape
pretty
good
a
bit
thin
this
is
a
great
session
beer
plenty
of
flavor
and
smoothness
keep
this
one
a
great
choice
very
thin
mouthfeel
far
less
than
i
expected
from
a
classic
d
not
bad
just
somewhat
boring
o
fantastic
offering
for
a
dunkel
i
could
drink
these
all
day
sure
its
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
a
nice
balance
for
a
session
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
not
very
exciting
the
flavour
is
well
balanced
and
its
easy
to
drink
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
though
baltic
porter
and
hefeweizen
have
proven
old
country
breweries
can
pump
out
unique
quality
product
step
it
up
dunkel
lager
overall
drinkability
not
too
shabby
smell
on
swirling
was
not
good
but
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
and
okay
dark
german
lager
i
remember
having
this
many
years
ago
with
a
meal
and
it
went
well
with
that
but
by
itself
its
okay
as
well
but
i
think
its
better
with
food
than
by
itself
as
i
did
tonight
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
cola
colored
liquid
with
a
fizzy
tan
looking
head
the
lacing
is
very
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
traditional
pilsner
aromas
in
it
along
with
a
light
roasted
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
with
a
dry
bitterness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
is
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
its
a
decent
dark
brew
from
germany
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
it
doesnt
really
hit
the
style
at
all
no
rich
malt
flavors
not
really
any
roasted
malt
flavors
just
a
watered
down
beer
that
could
be
a
pale
lager
with
food
coloring
added
o
a
little
dull
for
some
reason
i
feel
like
saying
its
because
its
watery
but
it
isnt
really
okay
to
drink
while
partying
camping
hiking
or
something
but
meh
funny
story
behind
this
one
its
actually
the
very
first
beer
i
ever
tasted
when
i
was
9
or
10
my
family
and
i
were
out
at
a
restaurant
and
i
mistook
my
moms
warsteiner
for
my
cocacola
i
immediately
spit
it
back
into
the
glass
ruining
her
beer
it
became
a
joke
with
us
for
years
and
i
will
always
remember
that
overall
a
very
solid
brew
and
what
you
expect
from
a
large
brewer
for
a
dunkel
flavors
are
clean
and
presentation
and
mouthfeel
are
great
11
2oz
bottle
from
ajs
arcadia
pours
clear
dark
brown
with
red
hue
and
tan
head
average
carbonation
aroma
has
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malts
biscuit
and
bubblegum
taste
follows
suit
with
sweet
caramel
and
biscuity
notes
very
crisp
beer
light
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
smooth
finish
easy
to
drink
not
a
fan
wouldnt
recommend
overall
very
average
beer
overall
easy
to
drink
and
for
what
flavor
is
there
its
tasty
but
its
just
weak
in
all
departments
and
for
that
i
say
nay
i
wouldnt
go
after
this
again
this
is
a
weak
beer
lacks
alot
of
elements
that
makes
this
style
one
of
my
favorites
or
it
lacks
the
depth
and
strength
of
flavor
you
want
expect
and
deserve
dont
try
this
as
your
introduction
to
the
style
an
ok
brew
but
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
true
munich
dunkel
lager
look
elsewhere
o
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
one
too
much
emphasis
on
the
roast
and
it
was
a
bit
too
much
for
such
a
light
beer
overall
a
decent
seasonal
beer
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
inoffensive
and
smooth
good
to
crack
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
i
recommend
a
try
this
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
with
a
nice
head
the
beer
poured
completely
opaque
with
little
to
no
transparency
the
smell
was
that
of
caramel
and
spices
the
flavor
was
a
bit
sweeter
than
expected
and
the
feel
was
a
bit
too
heavy
for
the
taste
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
one
slowly
and
after
meals
this
beer
pours
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
that
gives
off
a
strong
aroma
of
hops
and
light
fruit
this
is
a
very
dark
looking
beer
with
little
to
no
transparency
this
is
definitely
a
full
bodied
beer
packed
with
flavor
it
has
flavors
of
caramel
hops
nuts
and
spice
this
beer
best
reminds
me
of
guinness
but
lacking
such
and
intense
flavor
of
coffee
it
is
a
great
dessert
beer
cheers
o
i
am
clueless
as
to
why
this
beer
only
gets
a
b
overall
as
of
apr
2011
this
is
a
good
solid
dark
german
beer
overall
this
beer
is
ok
for
thirst
quenching
d
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
it
has
good
flavor
but
its
not
astounding
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
but
i
also
wouldnt
seek
it
out
on
the
good
side
of
average
overall
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
lighter
less
aggressive
spaten
optimator
it
appears
to
be
just
about
the
only
dunkel
available
in
memphis
but
its
a
pretty
good
one
compared
to
other
beers
available
in
supermarkets
and
convenience
stores
for
the
1
50bottle
mark
its
difficult
to
beat
its
unassuming
to
a
faultit
tastes
good
but
seems
too
restrained
still
this
is
recommended
especially
if
youre
on
a
budget
and
dont
want
to
spend
too
much
money
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
anything
as
good
at
this
price
point
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
bodied
really
refreshing
you
could
drink
these
until
you
die
because
the
flavor
wont
slow
you
down
it
is
a
weak
beer
and
maybe
something
to
give
to
beginners
to
cut
their
palates
on
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
shades
of
vermilion
when
light
is
passed
through
there
is
no
head
to
the
beer
i
tried
to
agitate
some
up
el
zilcho
the
aromatics
are
solid
nothing
special
but
there
is
a
nice
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
corn
sugar
in
the
back
the
taste
was
hard
to
peg
its
got
the
body
of
a
heavy
aal
with
some
flavorings
of
a
handful
of
dark
roast
specialty
malts
its
a
juxtaposition
of
flavors
in
my
opinion
one
helps
and
one
hurts
so
where
is
the
flavor
left
somewhere
in
the
not
that
great
realm
the
mouthfeel
is
oddly
sticky
and
cloying
but
with
the
body
is
light
on
the
palate
im
not
really
a
fan
of
how
dry
this
beer
finishes
as
well
the
drinkability
is
decent
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
overall
to
enjoy
there
was
absolutely
nothing
special
or
offputting
about
this
beer
it
was
just
beer
its
hard
to
describe
much
else
on
this
beer
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
pleasant
but
understated
with
a
faint
grainy
sweetness
the
taste
is
much
more
pronounced
with
a
dominant
malt
base
that
features
flavors
of
cereal
grains
cherry
sweetness
and
maybe
even
a
bit
of
weak
coffee
and
raisins
although
certainly
crisp
and
clean
the
prickly
fine
carbonation
is
almost
distracting
overall
this
is
a
solid
crisp
drinkable
beer
it
isnt
remarkable
in
any
sense
but
it
is
very
nice
d
i
dont
think
id
be
able
to
have
bottle
upon
bottle
of
this
beer
but
could
really
enjoy
2
or
3
in
a
sitting
it
iis
flavorful
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
nice
example
of
a
dark
lager
from
notes
this
is
a
very
tasty
dunkel
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
hint
of
bitter
coffee
pour
was
beautiful
deep
dark
brown
with
a
puffy
1
finger
off
whitetan
head
taste
was
nice
and
light
but
with
a
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
a
hint
of
toffee
in
the
aftertaste
that
leaves
a
bitterness
after
the
swallow
easy
to
drink
which
is
what
a
german
beer
should
be
all
about
overall
putting
this
beer
on
my
return
to
list
bought
only
a
single
sampler
but
will
probably
buy
several
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
german
style
dunkel
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
its
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
quite
sessionable
the
mouthfeel
is
vey
solid
with
its
firm
crackle
of
carbonation
and
light
body
this
is
a
simple
beer
and
executed
very
well
the
low
abv
makes
it
extreamly
drinkable
and
the
flavor
will
keep
me
coming
back
to
it
very
satisfying
put
this
on
your
list
to
try
good
beer
to
drink
and
relax
with
a
fairly
easy
going
dunkel
that
most
anyone
can
enjoy
would
work
well
anytime
between
fall
and
spring
dhighly
drinkable
plenty
of
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
complexity
nice
low
abv
would
make
a
great
sessin
beer
nothing
great
but
nothing
offensive
much
better
then
our
big
name
brews
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
notes
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
i
would
try
this
again
if
i
saw
it
on
draft
d
simple
and
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
love
dark
beers
especially
dark
german
beers
and
one
dark
dutch
beer
some
of
my
other
favorites
are
becks
dark
st
pauli
girl
dark
and
heineken
dark
however
having
discovered
the
premium
dunkel
warsteiners
dark
ive
been
in
heaven
it
has
that
slightly
bitter
after
taste
like
guiness
but
not
as
strong
or
as
overpowering
yet
still
yielding
that
deep
and
rich
flavor
that
only
a
dark
beer
can
offer
so
unlike
guiness
one
can
put
away
several
of
these
whereas
one
can
only
consume
a
couple
of
guiness
stouts
if
you
havent
tried
it
i
highly
recommend
it
warsteiner
premium
dunkel
has
dark
brown
colour
and
a
good
1
cm
head
when
poured
it
maintains
good
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweet
chocolate
the
taste
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
sourness
to
begin
with
but
gets
more
interesting
and
the
end
with
roastiness
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
this
beer
is
quite
foamy
and
thick
in
the
mouth
overall
a
very
nice
brew
overall
its
light
bland
and
pretty
boring
plain
dark
beers
are
always
disappointing
i
think
i
didnt
even
want
to
finish
it
more
depth
of
flavor
than
the
regular
warsteiner
but
nothing
outstanding
good
session
beer
especially
with
some
sauerkraut
and
knockwurst
had
this
on
tap
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
pours
a
rubybrown
colour
with
thin
offwhite
head
not
too
much
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
molasses
but
other
than
that
pretty
much
just
grainy
flavour
has
no
bitterness
that
i
can
detect
just
some
mild
sweetness
smooth
carbonation
level
just
an
ok
beer
i
wouldnt
pass
on
this
if
offered
but
i
will
not
seek
out
again
330
ml
bottle
pours
brown
with
an
average
offwhite
head
aroma
of
grassy
piney
hops
and
some
toasted
malt
medium
crisp
body
taste
is
light
grassy
hops
buckwheat
hints
of
honey
toasted
malt
and
alcohol
medium
slightly
hoppy
finish
im
not
impressed
by
this
brew
great
taste
drinkabilitly
this
brew
is
not
bad
i
didnt
find
anything
real
complicated
about
it
nice
session
brew
would
pair
well
with
a
cool
evening
if
this
beer
were
available
at
a
social
event
i
would
drink
it
without
fuss
not
a
bad
dunkel
lager
but
i
had
better
german
dunkels
when
i
was
over
there
overall
a
good
brew
but
would
be
better
if
the
flavours
were
heightened
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
as
part
of
the
las
vegas
hiltons
octoberfest
special
not
as
unimpressed
as
i
was
in
germany
but
perhaps
thats
because
i
was
surrounded
by
german
beers
there
typical
of
a
dunkel
in
color
and
carbonation
dark
caramel
with
a
good
lighter
head
good
aroma
with
a
bready
smell
overall
not
bad
but
i
was
sticking
with
the
draft
pilsner
instead
this
was
not
what
i
expected
it
was
much
lighter
in
color
and
not
nearly
as
deep
as
i
had
hoped
the
overall
quality
was
good
but
i
thought
it
would
have
been
much
deeper
and
more
robust
i
am
still
on
my
quest
to
find
the
best
german
beers
and
this
was
average
but
not
as
flavorful
and
unique
as
i
thought
it
should
have
been
good
looking
very
dark
beer
which
gave
me
a
one
finger
head
that
didnt
last
more
than
20
seconds
lice
is
sort
of
brokeup
but
has
a
good
cling
the
color
of
the
beer
rates
a
30
on
the
srm
chart
smells
like
honey
and
licorice
tastes
that
i
recognize
in
this
brew
are
licorice
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
as
milk
a
little
coated
easy
on
the
palate
not
a
great
dark
lager
lacks
any
great
taste
but
overall
it
is
a
flavor
that
sort
of
grows
on
me
better
as
it
warms
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
d
a
nice
flavorful
lager
thats
not
too
expensive
i
thought
it
was
a
step
above
an
average
dunkel
lager
but
im
not
too
crazy
about
it
very
balanced
i
think
i
would
have
like
a
bit
more
body
to
it
but
thats
just
me
definitely
worth
a
try
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
but
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
again
d
refreshing
and
drinkable
with
so
many
dunkels
being
so
similar
its
hard
to
prefer
one
over
the
other
this
one
stands
out
to
me
but
not
in
a
positive
way
good
beer
but
there
are
several
better
choices
not
my
favourite
but
definitely
drinkable
i
would
definitely
have
in
favour
of
a
lot
of
other
beers
d
not
my
favorite
but
adequate
if
presented
with
the
choice
between
it
and
some
lesser
beers
drinkability
is
average
dpretty
easy
drinking
but
a
little
bland
for
my
tastes
and
unremarkable
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
then
again
there
are
not
alot
of
german
import
beers
i
didnt
like
as
stated
above
if
your
outside
grillin
or
eatting
seafood
pair
w
this
beer
for
a
tasty
time
drink
straight
from
bottle
enjoy
conclusion
not
worth
its
premium
import
price
at
the
grocery
store
the
flavors
tasted
fake
and
too
manufactured
skip
it
drinkability
a
nice
session
lager
but
i
wanted
more
flavor
excellent
beer
has
everything
a
great
beer
should
was
a
perfect
match
for
bratwurst
sauerkraut
potatoes
for
dinner
highly
recommended
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
somewhat
basic
in
the
flavour
department
a
decent
enough
brew
but
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
poured
a
dark
clear
mahogany
with
red
hints
one
fingered
light
tan
head
with
little
to
no
lacing
light
sweet
carmel
malt
aromas
reminded
me
of
cotton
candy
on
the
pallette
i
found
it
to
have
a
sweet
metallic
bite
almost
like
the
labeling
had
managed
to
get
into
the
bottle
with
an
expresso
coffee
under
tones
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
wasnt
overly
empressed
or
dissapointed
might
have
to
try
on
tap
i
felt
it
was
overly
sweet
not
really
impressed
at
all
md
somewhat
thin
body
for
the
style
carbonation
is
medium
the
cardboardboxstraightfromtheattic
quality
of
the
aftertaste
really
convinces
me
that
i
shouldnt
have
another
500ml
can
from
the
lcbo
chestnut
brown
in
colour
with
copper
hues
and
a
thin
offwhite
cap
that
eventually
dissipates
to
nothing
smell
and
taste
are
light
metallic
grassiness
grainy
malts
very
hollow
and
tinny
adjuncts
maybe
small
trace
of
walnut
and
a
mildly
sour
malted
finish
inoffensive
but
painfully
generic
mouthfeel
is
the
saving
grace
of
this
beer
medium
crisp
a
little
creamy
moderate
carbonation
some
spice
on
the
palate
lasting
dryness
aftertaste
borders
on
citric
which
is
weird
for
the
style
i
cant
say
im
impressed
in
fact
this
is
just
as
bad
as
rickards
dark
forgettable
not
impressed
d
this
beer
is
crisp
and
light
but
not
terribly
exciting
the
low
abv
makes
for
easy
sessions
d
a
nice
refreshing
brew
drinkability
im
not
buying
this
again
beer
looked
dark
brown
with
a
head
that
id
say
fell
out
of
ring
status
very
quickly
nothing
too
enticing
on
the
aroma
front
either
mineral
and
metallic
scents
outweighed
the
malt
taste
was
mostly
earthy
and
coffeelike
with
a
tinge
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
a
bit
thin
overall
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
weak
cup
of
coffee
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
a
great
beer
i
remember
enjoying
some
warsteiner
on
tap
a
few
years
ago
but
it
must
not
have
been
the
dunkel
d
the
settling
of
the
flavormouthfeel
after
the
carbonation
dissipates
is
cumbersome
but
the
finish
is
great
dsome
decent
flavors
but
a
few
things
that
take
away
from
what
could
be
a
very
good
beer
it
isnt
bad
and
can
be
enjoyed
d
very
drinkable
not
heavy
or
foamy
brewed
w
hop
extract
instead
of
the
green
stuff
but
in
this
case
it
seems
ok
d
really
a
nice
uncomplicated
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
a
solid
example
of
the
style
but
the
weak
mouthfeel
holds
it
back
this
used
to
be
my
favorite
beer
but
im
afraid
that
ive
moved
beyond
it
not
bad
at
less
than
2
bucks
a
pop
its
certainly
a
good
choice
for
a
session
not
my
favorite
dunkel
lager
but
something
to
keep
on
hand
i
have
to
say
that
after
reading
numerous
books
on
beer
styles
and
hearing
about
the
history
of
this
brewery
i
was
letdown
by
my
own
anticipation
d
goes
down
alright
but
not
as
well
as
the
real
thing
not
bad
for
a
bottled
dunkel
though
quite
an
enjoyable
lager
i
could
drink
this
almost
anytime
d
this
is
a
real
easy
drinking
pint
its
not
as
complex
as
id
like
it
to
be
rather
onedimensional
i
do
enjoy
it
though
and
i
would
probably
order
another
medium
mouthfeel
and
overall
drinkable
this
is
one
that
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
d
obviously
drinkable
but
id
prefer
to
look
elsewhere
for
my
standardstock
modestpriced
dark
beer
to
have
on
hand
its
got
a
smooth
medium
body
with
long
finish
enjoyability
score
indifferent
d
i
could
see
me
drinking
this
more
often
will
buy
another
case
when
it
comes
to
the
right
time
of
year
this
really
isnt
all
that
bad
a
beer
and
i
could
see
myself
being
able
to
session
it
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
other
than
the
fact
that
its
remarkably
simple
that
fact
means
i
probably
wont
return
to
it
ever
again
especially
when
we
do
simple
so
well
in
ontario
but
i
did
enjoy
this
pint

not

that

theres
definitely
beers
both
german

american
that
id
rather
have

still
nice

crisp
in
the
mouth
moderately
sessionable
due
to
its
fillingness
and
sweetness
an
enjoyable
brew
id
buy
it
again
but
if
it
was
gone
i
could
careless
serving
type
can
drinkability
its
drinkable
there
are
better
dunkels
out
there
but
this
is
still
good
beer
is
smooth
no
clear
flavor
to
me
though
its
bland
and
goes
down
quick
finishes
cleanly
some
finer
lagers
this
is
the
goals
so
i
guess
its
ok
i
just
want
to
know
that
im
drinking
something
beer
is
thin
which
is
fine
drinkability
is
high
its
like
water
its
ok
d
high
dunkel
lagers
usually
equal
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
solid
performer
in
its
style
yet
it
is
not
among
the
best
if
one
is
looking
for
a
session
beer
that
can
easily
be
forgotten
well
this
is
it
nice
and
easy
drinking
i
like
it
notes
the
standard
dark
german
import
taste
nothing
spectacular
and
nothing
compared
to
what
is
available
domestically
in
germany
for
this
style
just
an
average
import
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
shades
of
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
nice
prolific
white
head
not
much
going
on
with
the
nose
malt
was
about
all
i
caught
taste
was
similar
malty
with
hints
of
some
other
stuff
going
on
very
little
carbonation
early
on
the
mouthfeel
seemed
almost
creamy
to
me
but
towards
the
end
it
felt
very
watery
all
in
all
a
very
unremarkable
taste
with
an
average
mouthfeel
theres
nothing
complicated
going
on
here
so
while
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
it
also
makes
it
a
bit
boring
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
decent
but
nothing
special
could
use
more
body
or
more
something
to
counter
the
average
malt
profile
epic
dunkel
fail
taste
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
dry
toasty
and
grassy
bitterness
in
the
finish
malts
are
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
indicates
but
a
few
roasty
chocolate
notes
linger
on
into
the
taste
this
is
not
the
boldest
dunkel
out
there
but
it
is
well
crafted
and
super
easy
to
drink
i
am
a
fan
of
dunkels
but
after
having
a
couple
other
warsteiner
beers
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
more
or
less
balanced
tasty
dark
german
lager
the
roasted
character
making
up
for
the
lack
of
overt
hop
bitterness
simple
and
drinkable
with
the
more
robust
sorts
of
charred
or
baked
comestibles
it
would
seem
d
very
drinkable
could
be
a
good
session
beer
execution
doesnt
live
up
to
the
presentation
not
a
very
distinct
example
of
the
style
and
there
are
many
other
german
brewers
doing
it
better
the
lack
of
flavor
would
make
me
not
to
drink
this
beer
again
dlow
abv
nice
overall
character
not
watery
in
the
least
i
see
this
as
an
excellent
session
beer
good
stuff
light
to
medium
body
high
drinkability
ideal
for
a
warm
day
a
sessionable
dark
lager
for
sure
dark
copper
with
a
crater
marked
light
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quicky
and
leaves
very
little
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
pretty
weak
for
the
style
toasted
grain
and
the
slightest
suggestion
of
toffee
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
but
still
seems
really
light
and
dry
for
the
style
but
not
unpleasant
the
body
is
also
on
the
lighter
side
drinkability
is
good
but
the
flavors
are
more
dortmunder
than
dunkel
imo
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
brownish
color
head
there
is
a
little
lacing
left
after
the
head
and
drink
are
drained
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
a
slight
floral
the
taste
is
rather
weak
the
is
a
little
malt
and
a
little
sweetness
with
a
little
harsh
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
there
is
a
little
harsh
tone
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
it
isnt
as
good
as
other
dunkels
the
hofbrauhaus
dunkel
is
a
better
choice
medium
to
mild
carbonation
i
was
hoping
for
a
better
drink
d
overall
a
tasty
brew
thats
pretty
light
in
body
but
is
predominantly
on
the
sweet
side
and
a
bit
filling
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
but
probably
could
not
stomach
much
more
than
that
not
a
bad
beer
for
its
relatively
broad
distribution
as
i
seem
to
see
warsteiner
beers
fairly
often
nowadays
pretty
good
dunno
if
i
want
to
buy
another
overall
a
surprisingly
good
selection
from
warsteiner
i
had
a
burger
with
this
one
at
a
restaraunt
good
deep
red
color
not
too
harsh
of
a
taste
but
it
did
have
a
heavy
caramel
taste
with
it
overall
a
good
beer
still
very
happy
with
this
line
of
beers
with
all
the
tall
cans
of
pale
lager
in
the
bc
liqour
stores
it
is
nice
to
see
a
dunkel
available
in
cans
this
is
a
pretty
nice
take
on
the
style
with
a
full
mouthfeel
making
this
an
enjoyable
drink
the
beer
is
roasty
and
kinda
sweet
with
caramel
overtones
but
does
not
have
the
thinness
that
plagues
some
takes
on
the
style
decent
enough
and
food
friendly
including
bbq
make
this
a
summer
evening
addition
to
the
beer
quiver
deep
red
color
almost
would
look
like
a
cola
if
it
wasnt
for
the
foam
surprisingly
theres
very
little
roasted
characteristics
but
instead
its
very
heavy
on
the
caramel
the
hops
balance
the
flavor
leaving
a
very
mild
bitterness
that
stays
on
the
tongue
well
after
the
beer
is
swallowed
d
while
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
not
anything
to
get
excited
about
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
could
easily
be
sessioned
drinkability
while
not
a
great
beer
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
one
and
i
could
easily
have
another
while
not
challenging
in
any
way
this
beer
goes
down
easily
the
last
half
of
the
beer
also
went
quite
well
with
the
bratwurst
sandwich
and
german
potato
salad
that
i
had
for
lunch
i
wouldnt
be
sad
if
told
i
could
never
have
this
again
its
looks
and
mouthfeel
are
better
than
average
but
those
alone
do
not
make
a
good
beer
the
bottles
are
only
11
2
oz
and
the
alcohol
is
only
4
8
and
its
smooth
like
a
porter
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
enjoy
every
one
the
taste
is
very
sweet
adjunct
type
of
sweetner
maybe
some
cooked
veggies
added
along
the
way
with
a
slightly
roasted
malt
flavor
maybe
some
caramel
in
there
too
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
not
much
taste
or
aftertaste
either
there
is
a
slightly
off
sourishness
to
the
beer
that
doesnt
add
to
the
enjoyment
of
it
this
beer
is
not
all
that
interesting
and
im
going
to
reach
for
something
better
starting
now
d
could
be
high
due
to
how
light
it
is
but
the
after
taste
kills
it
warsteiner
dunkel
really
fights
to
be
an
average
beer
it
makes
it
by
a
nose
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
needs
a
good
bit
of
work
to
be
a
good
beer
the
nose
is
weak
and
it
lacks
flavor
given
those
two
faults
its
very
lucky
to
be
an
average
beer
not
something
id
seek
out
by
any
means
update
when
i
let
it
sit
for
a
few
minutes
and
warm
more
of
the
malt
flavor
came
in
and
the
raisin
citrus
flavor
was
a
little
more
balanced
with
it
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
thick
head
and
good
lacing
down
glass
the
smell
was
a
little
weird
some
hops
and
a
slight
skunky
smell
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
flowery
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
and
again
a
little
bit
skunky
in
flavor
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
less
than
normal
carbonation
there
was
a
somewhat
metallic
taste
to
this
it
reminded
of
the
other
warsteiner
beers
in
flavor
with
the
added
goodness
of
roasted
malts
well
a
pretty
balanced
example
of
this
style
usually
dark
lagers
can
be
devoid
of
flavor
not
so
here
enough
flavor
to
satisfy
not
heavy
enough
to
prevent
you
from
having
another
d
pretty
drinkable
would
drink
again
i
think
i
will
buy
better
beer
though
kind
of
a
let
down
for
my
first
german
beer
pours
a
very
dark
redbrown
colored
body
somewhat
transparent
looking
with
a
big
frothy
offwhite
head
has
a
funky
spicy
aroma
maltiness
dark
fruit
dark
fruity
musty
taste
maybe
like
overripe
bananas
grapey
malty
fizzy
good
wish
the
abv
was
higher
but
with
that
4
9
this
light
tasty
dunkel
could
be
a
session
beer
i
find
this
beer
to
be
much
smoother
than
warsteiner
premium
verum
the
lighter
colored
version
presentation
is
nice
a
firm
froth
about
half
an
inch
on
top
after
it
is
poured
smell
is
of
ripe
hopes
and
the
aroma
stays
with
the
taste
aftertaste
is
a
mild
bitter
hopsy
kind
of
taste
very
good
all
around
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
my
fathers
brand
and
i
can
see
why
he
enjoys
it
d
3
5
the
smell
of
ths
one
is
the
standout
for
sure
its
my
most
preferred
warsteiner
so
far
not
bad
at
all
just
not
top
pn
my
list
worth
a
try
for
sure
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
silky
it
does
however
have
a
bit
of
an
average
taste
nothing
stands
out
too
much
still
ill
have
another
d
an
alright
brew
that
just
lacks
that
special
quality
pours
a
beautiful
rubybrown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
expectantly
malty
head
dissipates
and
leaves
little
lace
taste
is
of
malt
pear
and
what
i
interpreted
as
a
bit
of
a
vanilla
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
beer
but
nothing
special
overall
not
that
wonderful
and
therefore
not
especially
drinkable
wont
go
searching
for
this
one
this
beer
is
probably
agreeable
to
some
but
that
group
certainly
wouldnt
include
those
who
have
tried
a
real
munich
dunkel
even
for
something
aimed
at
swill
lager
drinkers
it
surprises
me
that
a
nation
so
rich
in
brewing
tradition
one
of
the
few
places
on
earth
with
a
longstanding
and
still
prominent
beer
culture
and
a
people
rightfully
proud
of
their
national
drink
could
release
something
this
low
in
quality
drinkability
the
first
two
went
down
pretty
easy
only
22
to
go
no
prob
i
find
myself
wanting
to
pick
this
up
quite
often
notes
a
decent
brew
with
a
very
easy
to
drink
feel
if
you
want
a
low
abv
with
a
good
quality
taste
then
here
it
is
nice
atmosphere
a
pretty
simple
but
solid
flavor
and
hearty
feel
make
for
very
nice
drinkability
good
quaff
this
is
very
drinkable
given
the
overall
flavors
and
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
yet
light
flavored
session
beer
decent
worth
a
try
i
could
drink
this
again
with
a
good
german
bratwurst
and
sauerkraut
i
look
forward
to
trying
others
from
this
brewery
pretty
good
but
not
overly
impressive
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
see
if
its
any
better
d
a
good
simple
beer
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
but
is
a
refreshing
choice
on
draft
at
the
waldhaus
pub
at
the
banff
springs
hotel
served
in
a
logoed
flute
glass
with
coaster
poured
reddishbrown
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
good
foam
retention
irregular
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
light
malt
nutty
malty
flavor
with
toasted
nuttiness
it
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
easy
drinking
flavorful
a
great
sessional
not
overly
heavy
or
complex
nor
is
it
meant
to
be
nice
ruby
glint
in
direct
light
thin
head
with
decent
retention
otherwise
typical
dark
brown
body
with
some
visible
carbonation
streams
distinct
aroma
of
roasted
barley
probably
its
most
redeeming
quality
dull
papery
malt
flavor
like
many
other
euro
lagers
but
with
some
mild
hop
presence
not
especially
roasty
in
the
taste
dry
and
quick
in
the
finish
fairly
light
and
dry
feel
yet
still
substantial
enough
to
sip
instead
of
chug
decent
enough
to
have
a
couple
but
doesnt
really
hold
interest
very
long
d
very
drinkable
and
light
per
style
but
overall
the
malt
complexity
and
flavor
makes
this
beer
stand
out
drinkability
worth
a
try
not
the
best
but
good
for
a
couple
beers
mouthfeeldrinkability
nothing
special
and
definately
not
something
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
a
small
head
that
lingers
as
a
cap
for
a
while
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
with
tons
of
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
smoke
on
top
of
a
light
breadiness
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
full
as
the
aroma
with
a
sweet
maltiness
that
flows
into
a
grainy
aftertaste
with
no
hops
to
be
found
the
smokiness
is
not
as
prominent
as
the
aroma
either
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
session
lager
though
with
very
little
complexity
basic
but
drinkable
a
light
brown
head
about
12
in
thick
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
tints
of
red
the
is
an
initial
moderate
sweetness
with
coffee
malt
and
a
hint
of
molasses
and
earth
the
finish
is
some
what
long
with
coffee
and
molasses
and
a
hint
of
earth
there
is
however
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
on
the
end
which
makes
it
a
little
bit
astringent
it
is
good
beer
overall
and
easy
to
drink
the
body
of
the
beer
seems
to
be
light
and
moderate
the
texture
is
syrupy
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderately
light
moderately
high
carbonation
very
slight
carbonic
acid
zing
nothing
special
here
is
rather
drinkeable
but
not
especially
so
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
produced
a
fizzy
head
of
tan
foam
atop
a
colabrown
liquid
looked
like
rootbeer
the
heads
was
short
lived
and
the
lacing
the
aroma
was
lightly
malty
slightly
toasted
and
grainy
with
a
hint
of
sourness
the
flavors
were
started
on
a
sweet
malty
note
but
then
was
punctuated
by
the
sour
lemonyhops
character
and
some
bitterness
hints
of
metal
that
linger
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
frothy
and
watery
well
known
for
the
style
but
not
worth
the
hype
notes
really
glad
that
i
had
this
from
a
bottle
at
the
german
christmas
festival
it
would
be
better
to
have
it
from
a
glass
however
to
fully
appreciate
it
it
has
a
dark
body
with
not
much
for
head
and
thin
lace
the
lace
it
does
have
is
pretty
tight
the
body
is
brown
amber
it
has
a
roasted
malt
aroma
but
is
not
very
strong
the
taste
is
grainy
and
roasty
but
there
is
not
much
else
to
it
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
it
is
just
basic
it
does
not
have
a
hearty
body
that
one
might
think
i
would
give
this
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
and
it
has
a
good
price
as
i
found
it
for
6
65
a
sixer
although
the
abv
means
that
this
could
be
sessionable
the
simple
sweet
flavor
precludes
that
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
that
ill
ever
seek
out
again
a
very
enjoyable
beer
if
not
the
most
complex
still
i
really
enjoy
the
clean
and
crisp
feel
of
a
lager
while
still
having
more
depth
and
flavor
than
a
typical
light
lager
overall
not
a
good
beer
it
was
weak
in
aroma
and
taste
and
just
didnt
do
anything
more
than
a
bmc
in
my
opinion
avoid
my
first
crack
at
a
new
style
and
i
must
say
its
pretty
good
pours
a
beautiful
deep
red
color
with
some
nice
malty
aroma
and
taste
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
with
supreme
drinkability
seems
like
the
euro
version
of
a
brown
ale
to
me
but
i
liked
this
beer
would
try
again
pours
a
cola
brown
with
amber
highlights
and
little
head
and
bubbling
the
aroma
has
nutty
light
toasted
malts
faint
stuffy
hops
and
some
very
well
masked
herbal
notes
start
to
finish
is
clean
tasted
malts
hintsof
light
powdered
cocoa
and
toffee
nuts
the
palate
linger
just
enough
powder
andtoast
to
make
a
great
dunkel
lagr
this
beer
has
lots
of
flavor
and
an
awesome
sessionability
o
pretty
solid
the
fairly
low
abv
and
smoothness
of
the
beer
present
it
as
a
reasonable
beer
to
have
a
few
of
overall
a
decent
but
perhaps
not
outstanding
dunkel
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
would
have
liked
more
depth
overall
but
is
a
light
abv
beer
overall
would
have
like
more
munich
malt
in
my
munich
lager
some
off
aged
notes
but
not
over
the
top
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dunkles
so
i
tried
to
rate
this
one
for
what
it
is
and
its
not
bad
definitely
not
my
first
choice
but
it
still
had
all
the
flavor
and
the
drinlablility
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
which
doesnt
really
entice
me
to
consume
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
smallthinbubbly
head
that
has
no
hang
time
to
speak
ofnor
does
it
produce
any
decent
lace
to
appreciate
the
nose
is
pretty
weak
and
disappointing
with
some
caramely
notes
and
brown
sugar
as
far
as
flavor
goes
i
can
enjoy
this
under
malted
dunkelbecause
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
more
than
what
it
can
provide
lightly
toasted
malt
and
some
subtle
caramel
sweetness
is
a
bit
lacklusterthe
tail
is
a
bit
hollow
as
well
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
slightly
skunked
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
thinone
notch
above
water
at
best
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
thats
where
its
going
to
get
its
highest
mark
an
average
dunkel
lager
at
best
drinkability
never
immensely
flavorful
or
exciting
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
ill
give
it
that
much
d
a
credible
drinker
may
not
wow
you
but
again
does
the
job
d
really
easy
to
drink
the
lighting
at
the
time
made
it
difficult
to
judge
the
exact
color
but
it
looked
cola
brown
with
some
amber
weaved
in
spongy
white
head
on
top
with
decent
retention
aroma
is
astrigent
with
some
toasted
grain
not
a
lot
intersting
here
the
taste
was
dissapointing
at
first
it
was
astringenthusky
upfront
but
much
of
that
faded
away
as
that
clears
it
sweetenes
to
raisinsgrapes
with
bits
of
dark
bread
hints
of
wood
throughout
the
beer
feels
chewy
and
medium
in
body
not
bad
tastes
great
light
and
complex
and
perfectly
balanced
starts
with
sweet
bready
grain
runs
quickly
into
a
spicy
and
bitter
noble
hop
and
then
ends
with
a
wonderful
melange
of
the
two
poured
to
a
good
off
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
minimal
lacing
dark
brown
in
color
smelled
of
malt
caramel
and
a
slightly
sweet
smell
tasted
of
smoke
malt
yeast
slightly
sweet
and
a
little
hoppy
had
a
good
flavor
overall
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
i
thought
was
about
right
i
would
like
to
try
this
as
a
session
beer
wasnt
to
heavy
just
all
and
all
a
good
tasting
beer
was
another
one
of
those
11
2
oz
this
pours
a
rich
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
fine
beige
head
aroma
is
malty
and
just
slightly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
cloves
and
smoke
flavor
is
smooth
mainly
malty
with
a
smoky
undertone
and
hints
of
spice
texture
is
smooth
and
pleasant
and
it
goes
down
very
nicely
d
well
this
actually
was
a
good
experiment
it
aged
nicely
and
was
very
tasty
after
almost
two
years
some
bourbon
notes
were
somewhat
suprising
fairly
deep
brown
in
colorsmall
and
tight
head
mellow
aromasomewhat
chestnut
like
and
a
mild
sulfur
smell
decent
flavor
nutty
and
somewhat
malty
very
slight
hop
bite
to
it
smooth
and
easy
going
down
lacks
the
softness
of
a
dunkel
that
i
have
had
in
other
examples
overall
a
pleasant
experience
good
beer
all
around
much
preferable
to
a
becks
or
pauli
girl
dark
for
sure
poured
a
thick
tannish
head
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
red
highlights
nose
is
clean
lightly
roasted
malt
with
not
a
bit
of
hop
in
sight
tastes
sweet
with
substantial
body
for
a
german
lager
nicely
roasted
dark
malt
with
just
a
smattering
of
hops
makes
this
finish
clean
very
wheaty
in
the
taste
and
aftertatse
its
a
fresh
wellmade
slightly
above
average
german
lager
a
refreshing
and
crisp
dunkel
more
about
textures
than
flavour
yet
still
enjoyable
da
very
drinkable
beer
if
youre
not
looking
to
be
wowed
quite
frankly
i
was
a
little
disappointed
and
cant
foresee
buying
again
not
bad
at
all
the
color
when
poured
was
a
medium
dark
brown
with
tan
foam
that
disapated
after
a
short
while
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
filled
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
had
a
bittersour
flavor
to
the
hops
that
was
very
evident
not
on
of
the
better
dunkels
but
a
thirst
quincher
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
for
being
as
dark
as
this
beer
is
it
is
not
at
all
heavy
or
commanding
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
and
weight
nothing
stands
out
in
the
way
of
flavors
but
all
those
combine
to
a
nice
beer
something
that
you
could
have
all
year
round
and
be
satisfied
i
havent
had
many
other
examples
of
munich
dunkel
but
this
beer
was
very
satisfying
and
i
would
definately
have
it
again
hopefully
nest
time
on
tap
d
great
example
of
a
munich
dunkel
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
really
good
d
not
a
bad
session
brew
if
one
was
in
the
mood
for
these
flavors
without
all
the
heaviness
a
relatively
tasty
beer
overall
but
lacking
severely
in
complexity
the
taste
just
doesnt
cut
it
moderate
bitterness
but
without
the
coffee
or
other
flavors
of
a
stout
and
without
the
smoothness
and
sweet
maltiness
you
expect
in
a
dunkel
its
just
an
unsatisfying
watery
dark
beer
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
brown
color
dunkel
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
light
sweet
caramel
malt
is
pretty
neutral
taste
is
very
bland
with
light
caramel
malt
with
not
much
character
very
bland
and
boring
version
of
the
style
and
not
something
i
am
about
to
buy
again
anytime
soon
d
although
relatively
cheap
compared
to
most
dunkels
its
hard
for
me
to
think
of
drinking
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
succession
a
nice
beer
to
start
a
session
with
md
the
beer
was
creamy
and
very
drinkable
it
may
have
been
slightly
over
carbonated
but
not
so
much
that
it
was
a
determent
to
the
beer
the
beer
also
had
an
aftertaste
to
it
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
it
was
overall
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
and
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
i
thought
that
i
would
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
d
excellent
session
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
any
time
of
the
year
tastes
of
fruits
sweet
malts
and
a
mild
hop
presence
this
is
a
good
drinkable
dark
lager
and
it
comes
in
cans
d
decent
drinkability
fresh
and
clean
with
good
balance
the
metallic
taste
was
the
major
thing
keeping
this
from
being
higher
poured
a
solid
dark
chocolately
color
with
little
head
smelled
rich
of
malt
maybe
a
little
hops
but
nothing
entirely
destict
it
tasted
pretty
good
but
again
nothing
too
distict
in
the
flavor
it
felt
medium
to
almost
thin
my
my
mouth
but
was
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
to
go
with
the
tacos
i
was
having
for
dinner
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
12
2008
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
dark
translucent
reddishbrown
with
a
1
head
which
disappeared
quickly
the
first
aromatic
flavour
that
hit
me
was
molasses
there
was
also
some
sweet
malt
and
cherry
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
ample
carbonation
the
flavour
was
maltygrainy
with
some
unplaceable
sourness
an
alright
beer
overall
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
i
liked
it
a
lot
more
than
most
reviewers
i
guess
very
tasty
and
easy
going
a
little
lighter
version
of
the
dunkel
style
overall
a
fine
addition
to
my
beer
repertoire
if
this
is
only
an
average
dunkel
according
to
your
reviews
ill
gladly
seek
out
a
good
one
far
superior
on
tap
one
of
my
fav
dunkels
pours
a
clear
deep
copperbrown
w
a
thin
light
tan
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
moderate
lacing
in
my
pils
glass
a
subtle
smell
cereal
grain
toasted
nuts
and
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
noble
hops
a
crisp
malty
flavor
nutty
w
a
caramellike
undertone
faint
figdatelike
notes
as
well
an
excellent
finish
very
dry
and
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
co2
this
beer
feels
like
it
evaporates
off
your
tongue
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
def
gonna
stock
this
up
for
summer
a
mediocre
dunkel
not
a
huge
warsteiner
fan
but
saw
this
on
tap
and
decided
to
give
it
a
go
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
died
quickly
a
light
malty
smell
that
is
somewhat
earthy
and
hopdriven
a
good
malt
taste
cocoa
but
mostly
hop
driven
with
a
touch
of
caramel
to
give
the
lighttomedium
body
smoothness
and
also
hints
of
citric
fruit
not
my
first
choice
for
a
dunkel
but
this
wasnt
too
bad
liked
it
more
than
regular
warsteiner
not
terrible
but
ill
look
for
another
before
trying
this
guy
again
i
always
like
the
dunkel
variety
of
beers
and
i
have
been
going
on
a
tasting
spree
with
german
darks
had
this
cold
in
a
pub
glass
poured
a
clear
coke
color
with
a
decent
head
smelled
mineral
like
with
a
little
grassy
note
and
some
faint
chocolate
malt
taste
was
sweet
and
slightly
metallic
but
smooth
and
drinkable
with
some
upfront
chocolate
malt
and
hops
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
mild
carbonation
clean
finish
not
too
shabby
draught
fox
hound
this
one
pours
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
on
it
it
doesnt
linger
long
there
was
no
real
lacing
to
it
the
color
is
a
rubytinged
brown
the
aroma
was
ok
although
not
too
strong
notes
of
molasses
caramel
maybe
a
hint
of
roastiness
slightly
less
than
a
medium
body
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
with
notes
of
the
caramel
and
molasses
a
hint
of
hops
for
balance
not
very
exciting
but
very
drinkable
da
very
easy
beer
to
drink
as
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
even
for
a
darker
beer
drinkablity
decent
and
drinkable
brew
d
easy
to
drink
but
pretty
weak
for
the
style
some
decent
brown
malt
flavors
but
kind
of
bland
and
watery
overall
loved
it
loved
it
loved
it
what
else
can
i
say
the
perfect
everyday
afterwork
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
lingering
head
smells
very
malty
light
carbonation
it
leaves
a
slightly
burnt
molasses
aftertaste
drinkability
is
good
id
do
it
again
great
with
snacks
dave
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
wisped
away
to
a
slight
ring
with
some
slight
lacing
smelled
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
but
i
think
i
am
just
used
to
stronger
beers
it
was
smooth
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
sweet
chocolate
and
some
coffee
notes
the
aftertaste
is
quite
pleasant
and
there
is
hardly
any
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
the
carbonation
makes
this
one
well
rounded
and
very
drinkable
as
a
footnote
id
like
to
add
that
if
you
are
put
off
by
this
by
the
brand
name
alone
try
it
out
this
is
so
much
better
than
warsteiners
lager
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
from
a
11
2oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
forming
a
12
inch
thin
white
head
which
leaves
light
spots
of
lace
along
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
malty
along
with
a
slight
grassy
aroma
and
a
hint
of
skunkiness
nothing
too
complex
the
taste
is
also
very
malty
a
bit
of
caramel
and
finishes
with
a
little
bitterness
smooth
light
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
light
alcohol
and
decent
flavor
overall
not
too
bad
a
good
afternoon
beer
smells
nice
and
malty
but
weak
and
a
bit
metallic
taste
is
headed
in
the
right
direction
but
never
really
gets
there
tastes
of
roasted
malts
and
even
a
very
slight
chocolate
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
unfortunately
the
flavor
doesnt
develop
as
much
as
it
could
and
leaves
me
wanting
some
complexity
to
this
drinkable
though
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
dunkel
lager
for
as
dark
and
heavy
as
this
beer
is
its
surprisingly
drinkable
although
more
than
a
couple
would
fill
you
up
pretty
good
d
very
drinkable
i
wish
they
made
this
in
cans
ruby
hued
with
a
very
thin
head
almost
no
retention
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
plums
given
the
very
sweet
smell
i
was
surprised
by
the
lack
of
flavor
overly
sweet
maltyness
up
front
with
a
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
the
sweetness
was
poorly
balanced
with
very
little
hop
character
i
drank
it
sort
of
fast
because
there
wasnt
much
to
it
overall
quite
a
disappointment
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
copper
hues
along
with
an
offwhite
head
that
provides
sporadic
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
the
taste
is
definitely
on
the
malty
side
with
caramel
malt
and
some
faint
hops
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
i
could
definitely
see
myself
throwing
back
a
couple
more
if
somebody
gave
them
to
me
it
is
not
something
that
i
would
purchase
again
but
it
is
worth
a
try
overall
not
for
everybody
my
gf
didnt
like
it
but
ill
surely
buy
more
d
this
is
a
decent
dunkel
it
suffers
from
a
bit
of
metallic
flavours
but
is
still
quite
pleasant
to
drink
and
goes
down
easy
it
makes
a
good
dark
session
lager
and
i
would
buy
it
again
dark
maroon
pour
with
almost
no
head
smell
was
skunky
medicinal
band
aid
and
was
more
than
likely
really
bad
taste
was
plastic
like
malt
and
medicinal
complete
drain
pour
on
this
one
and
one
of
the
worst
ive
had
surprised
this
one
could
have
been
spoiled
as
the
place
i
bought
it
from
turns
over
there
product
pretty
well
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
on
the
whole
but
not
something
i
could
get
attached
to
for
any
period
of
time
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
nothing
too
objectionable
its
a
good
beer
it
has
a
smooth
lightmedium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
about
average
drinkability
taste
is
thin
with
some
maltiness
and
little
to
no
hops
not
a
lot
of
bubbles
here
but
a
strong
co2
flavor
not
unlike
the
its
light
colored
cousin
with
some
darker
malts
added
not
a
great
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
interesting
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
wont
pay
for
many
of
them
either
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
darl
cola
color
with
a
white
head
that
dicipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
of
roasted
malts
and
wheat
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
suit
with
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
the
overall
drinkablity
of
this
beer
is
good
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
those
nights
you
want
to
drink
somthing
dark
but
sessionable
enough
that
you
dont
want
to
get
messed
up
pours
a
clear
deep
brown
color
with
a
below
average
head
that
left
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
grainy
with
a
steely
and
very
light
roasted
malt
aroma
some
light
nobel
hops
make
their
way
into
the
mix
the
taste
is
of
light
and
cracker
like
malt
slightly
roasted
some
nobel
hop
and
metallic
flavors
the
feel
is
watery
and
well
carbonated
finishes
quiet
neutral
a
rather
ho
hum
brew
not
a
bad
brew
to
use
in
between
big
brews
or
just
as
a
session
type
plug
just
ok
md
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
high
drinkability
is
good
it
doesnt
bring
a
lot
to
the
table
but
what
is
there
is
easily
downed
overall
a
simple
but
solid
brew
i
thought
this
is
one
of
the
better
looking
beers
i
have
poured
for
a
proud
german
beer
i
have
to
give
this
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
say
that
the
shipping
got
the
better
of
this
one
i
would
not
get
this
again
unless
it
comes
from
closer
to
the
source
the
flavors
are
not
complex
in
this
beer
light
malt
flavors
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
and
that
is
about
it
some
hint
of
diacetyl
until
it
warms
up
above
fridge
temps
it
has
a
rather
light
body
and
moderate
carbonation
it
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
wont
fill
you
up
get
you
smashed
or
kill
your
taste
buds
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
a
style
within
which
i
so
far
havent
found
too
much
deviation
yet
it
somehow
still
surprises
me
how
drinkable
this
style
beer
tends
to
be
this
beer
is
no
exception
i
prefer
this
stuff
on
tap
as
it
seems
to
be
even
smoother
but
not
bad
in
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
red
with
a
decent
head
big
but
a
little
loose
nutty
aroma
chestnuts
and
roastiness
with
a
background
metallic
note
taste
is
on
the
sweetish
side
with
good
roastiness
hops
arent
really
noticeable
in
terms
of
flavour
body
is
lightish
with
a
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
nthing
off
about
this
but
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
either
sessionable
maybe
got
this
beer
when
my
buddy
was
moving
out
of
his
house
thanks
kev
it
pours
a
dark
amber
into
my
glass
minimal
head
retention
that
leads
into
a
white
ring
smell
is
very
faint
only
get
some
caramel
from
the
roasted
malts
and
a
faint
hint
of
hops
that
come
through
taste
starts
out
sweet
with
the
malts
than
has
a
slight
hoppy
dry
finish
its
lightly
carbonated
so
it
goes
down
very
smooth
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
for
any
day
of
the
week
overall
an
average
dunkel
lager
ive
seen
this
at
my
local
grocery
store
for
a
while
and
never
tried
it
until
now
something
about
the
packaging
just
screamed
german
macro
to
me
and
thats
pretty
much
what
it
is
as
such
its
definately
better
than
amber
bock
easily
available
and
seems
to
slide
down
scarily
is
that
a
word
easy
overall
great
drinkability
would
be
awesome
summer
drink
for
lager
stand
in
when
you
want
something
more
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
1
finger
head
that
forms
extremely
quickly
and
falls
almost
just
as
fast
the
nose
almost
is
like
mild
cedar
the
taste
is
too
quick
though
and
doesnt
linger
at
all
leaving
barely
anything
for
you
to
remember
it
by
everything
leading
up
to
that
was
promising
but
the
flavor
to
me
is
a
let
down
d
complex
and
tasty
tasty
lager
good
for
style
d
very
nice
winter
session
beer
i
would
not
turn
this
beer
there
but
would
first
look
at
my
other
options
on
tap
before
ordering
this
its
a
pleasant
beer
overall
the
roasted
nose
is
unique
and
its
a
decent
dunkel
worth
a
try
for
sure
pretty
decent
beverage
from
warsteiner
a
thin
offwhite
head
rests
atop
a
walnut
brown
body
yet
the
aroma
fails
to
arouse
interest
a
moderately
malty
scent
wafts
up
but
little
else
the
taste
is
smooth
with
the
malt
blending
well
into
a
smooth
mixture
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
molasses
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
bitter
side
but
acceptably
so
worth
grabbing
a
sixer
d
one
mug
was
ore
than
enough
for
me
if
it
had
just
a
little
less
sweetness
i
may
have
gone
back
for
a
second
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
personally
but
its
better
than
their
verum
give
it
a
shot
and
you
probably
wont
be
disappointed
d
easily
able
to
drink
several
of
these
and
with
the
lower
abv
makes
a
great
sessionable
brew
d
after
having
a
pint
of
paulaner
salvator
on
tap
earlier
today
while
enjoying
a
hot
sandwich
at
mr
dunderbaks
this
dunkel
is
super
refreshing
light
on
alcohol
very
crisp
and
just
sweet
enough
to
help
bypass
the
holiday
import
chocolate
display
im
a
big
fan
of
hofbräu
dunkel
but
it
has
some
competition
now
i
wish
i
could
find
warsteiner
dunkel
on
tap
here
in
tampa
very
drinkable
looks
nice
pours
like
cocacola
with
head
glows
a
little
redder
but
still
quite
nice
smell
is
malty
very
malty
as
is
the
flavor
also
very
malty
slight
roasted
aroma
in
there
too
a
bit
sweet
but
not
too
much
only
complaint
about
this
one
is
the
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
left
after
it
warms
but
other
than
that
it
is
a
pretty
solid
and
easy
drinking
dunkel
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
the
appearance
to
this
beer
looks
exactly
like
that
of
a
cola
if
i
didnt
pour
it
myself
i
would
swear
it
was
a
pepsi
or
coke
from
looks
alone
i
like
the
smell
with
some
brown
sugar
nuttiness
and
raisin
sweet
lightly
toasted
malts
on
the
taste
with
a
cherry
like
finish
bitterness
is
almost
nonexistant
thin
mouthfeel
but
i
expected
that
nothing
mind
blowing
here
but
with
such
a
low
abv
you
can
surely
drink
this
by
the
liter
i
know
i
do
comes
out
a
nice
brown
color
that
allows
the
light
to
shine
through
it
it
has
an
excellent
sweetmalty
and
barley
scent
nice
taste
a
nice
bit
of
complexity
but
overall
just
a
good
malty
flavor
although
it
may
be
a
bit
too
sweet
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
is
easy
to
drink
d
highly
drinkable
i
ordered
a
few
of
these
before
moving
on
eh
i
dont
love
this
beer
not
awful
but
i
probably
wont
be
back
dark
brown
almost
black
in
appearance
with
a
big
white
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
tastes
of
roasted
malt
as
well
with
a
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
to
match
mouth
feel
is
good
pretty
drinkable
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
not
the
biggest
dunkel
i
have
had
but
not
a
bad
session
beer
at
all
almost
seems
as
if
the
flavors
were
tweaked
back
this
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
this
is
a
decent
beer
if
could
have
a
more
robust
malt
profile
though
on
tap
it
is
31
better
in
every
respect
on
tap
you
would
know
it
is
the
same
beer
so
much
better
prosit
overall
a
decent
and
relatively
tasty
dunkel
made
a
nice
filler
once
the
paulaner
oktoberfest
ran
out
the
mouth
was
left
smooth
with
a
hint
of
dryness
good
with
brats
and
real
german
music
makes
a
nice
touch
overall
it
is
what
it
is
a
malty
german
brew
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
you
will
like
it
if
you
are
like
me
bring
on
the
ales
pretty
good
beer
although
i
havent
had
many
dunkels
to
compare
it
to
not
a
great
dunkel
but
very
decent
pretty
disappointing
for
me
after
hearing
so
many
good
things
about
it
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
so
it
does
not
fill
you
up
or
bloat
you
with
carbonation
this
would
be
a
great
one
for
people
who
dont
like
dark
beer
drinkability
is
good
the
brew
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
all
the
while
presenting
good
concentration
and
flavor
profile
a
great
dunkel
cheers
poured
a
dark
brownish
reddish
color
with
a
creamy
1
finger
head
that
does
not
last
and
very
little
lacing
sniffs
a
sweet
malty
caramel
and
tastes
the
same
with
a
medium
body
that
goes
down
quite
easily
and
enjoyable
very
good
beer
actually
and
a
couple
of
these
before
moving
on
to
something
else
suits
me
fine
worth
trying
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
were
is
the
rich
robust
roasted
malt
flavor
there
is
almost
nothing
here
that
resembles
a
german
dunkel
a
disappointment
very
happy
to
finally
be
able
to
review
this
one
i
love
me
some
german
beer
and
a
dark
german
lager
is
probably
close
to
my
favorite
of
the
style
now
we
had
a
heck
of
a
night
with
all
these
brews
going
around
so
my
reviews
are
shorter
then
normal
but
you
can
still
get
the
point
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
big
three
inch
plus
foamy
tan
head
coming
across
the
top
lots
of
carbonation
and
side
glass
lace
throughout
very
malty
semll
not
alot
of
profile
in
the
aroma
taste
was
very
dark
lots
of
sweet
malty
grains
and
a
touch
of
cereal
good
dry
finidh
very
smooth
with
good
carbonation
could
have
easily
had
several
f
these
tonight
with
ease
but
there
were
like
8
different
beers
being
served
and
i
had
not
had
a
bunch
so
i
was
gonna
have
to
try
some
more
overall
this
was
just
like
i
thought
it
would
be
and
i
was
very
happy
with
it
a
damn
fine
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
a
nice
fruity
nose
dark
yet
clear
appearance
and
very
nice
crisp
mouth
feel
the
head
is
very
minimal
but
definitely
right
on
for
its
beer
style
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
note
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
so
my
review
may
reflect
that
but
this
is
my
favorite
beer
period
it
pours
out
dark
like
coffee
into
my
pint
glass
and
a
thin
light
tan
head
forms
the
head
disappears
somewhat
quickly
it
smells
perfect
exactly
like
a
beer
should
smell
roasted
malt
and
minimal
hops
i
love
beers
that
dont
try
to
create
all
kinds
of
different
flavors
im
a
fan
of
the
german
purity
law
of
1516
there
seems
to
be
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
just
a
tiny
bit
flat
if
i
were
to
participate
in
beerfest
this
would
be
the
beer
i
would
want
to
consume
great
beer
reinheitsgebot
is
best
i
thought
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
reddishblack
in
color
with
nice
head
that
managed
to
hang
around
a
while
slight
spicy
maltiness
with
clean
finish
sweet
malt
and
caramel
aroma
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasant
traditional
dark
brown
german
lager
very
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
well
it
looks
good
its
smell
is
pretty
bad
the
alcohol
is
pungent
but
there
is
little
else
desirable
i
have
no
desire
to
smell
it
any
further
there
is
a
little
bit
of
taste
to
speak
of
i
would
have
to
rank
it
no
far
above
a
yingling
unfortunately
i
wouldnt
buy
another
sixer
of
this
im
very
disappointed
this
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
strong
of
malt
and
has
some
chocolate
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
very
full
but
short
of
heavy

it
seems
well
suited
i
was
surprised
at
how
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
this
would
definitely
be
something
to
consider
for
sessions
d
this
is
another
very
good
beer
from
warsteiner
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
porter
thin
slightly
watery
it
tastes
like
a
pilsener
but
with
a
darker
finish
not
recommended
warsteiner
premium
dunkel
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
burnt
coffee
the
taste
is
disappointing
a
kind
of
harsh
bitterness
is
all
i
can
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
i
expected
more
bought
a
12
pack
of
bottles
for
16
with
a
best
on
date
of
41408
pours
a
very
dark
rusty
brown
that
you
can
see
through
if
held
up
to
the
light
average
head
and
nice
lacing
smells
of
a
slightly
overcooked
grain
that
description
really
doesnt
do
it
justice
but
thats
what
i
smelled
you
pick
up
the
aroma
nicely
on
every
sip
this
is
a
very
nice
medium
bodied
smooth
beer
the
smoothness
caught
me
by
surprise
its
a
little
dry
and
has
a
pleasant
aftertaste
this
drinks
very
easily
i
caught
myself
drinking
the
2nd
bottle
too
fast
i
think
thats
a
good
sign
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
very
much
worth
it
highly
recommended
hic
poured
from
the
bottle
came
out
a
nice
dark
brown
with
some
amber
tones
mild
and
a
little
light
head
did
not
retain
too
well
mediocre
lacing
smell
was
nice
but
a
little
faint
some
nice
malt
aromas
taste
was
real
nice
very
smooth
some
good
malty
and
chocolaty
taste
had
it
with
some
dark
chocolate
went
great
together
mouthfeel
a
little
lighter
than
expected
but
clean
and
smooth
went
down
great
all
in
all
very
nice
overall
competent
but
not
impressive
aroma
and
flavours
are
gentle
not
particularly
pronounced
some
malt
and
chocolatiness
thinbodied
a
little
too
subdued
to
be
a
memorable
quaff
but
nothing
offputting
about
this
one
a
decent
sessionable
dunkel
lager
pretty
inoffensive
nothing
particularly
special
though
imo
i
have
to
admit
this
is
one
i
liked
more
in
the
past
warsteiner
is
tasty
so
i
took
a
whirl
not
much
bottle
smell
roasted
malt
detable
but
kind
of
corny
poured
into
a
chalice
and
got
a
fizzy
head
with
big
bubbles
that
was
there
and
gone
very
dark
not
much
light
passing
through
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
too
much
taste
is
hints
of
dark
caramel
with
only
a
very
slight
bitter
hopping
nothing
really
stands
out
alot
blander
than
i
expected
very
drinkable
brew
but
i
was
expecting
more
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
nice
sipper
and
definitely
better
a
little
warmer
my
german
frau
told
me
this
wasnt
as
good
as
the
regular
warsteiner
the
verum
and
now
i
have
to
agree
it
lacks
character
ridiculously
easy
drinking
but
i
can
think
of
a
few
sessionworthy
beers
with
a
lot
more
flavor
an
easy
session
dunkel
for
sure
was
able
to
give
this
brew
a
try
on
tap
and
i
guess
i
was
a
little
disappointed
while
i
felt
that
it
was
a
fair
to
good
brew
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
the
color
was
chestnut
brown
with
a
nice
frothy
head
off
white
in
color
which
had
fair
retention
and
did
leave
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
while
the
presentation
was
nice
the
aroma
just
seemed
to
be
missing
something
i
was
able
to
pick
up
the
scent
of
malts
which
seemed
to
be
somewhat
sweet
with
a
slightly
caramel
aroma
maybe
slightly
roasted
the
taste
was
fair
again
with
the
taste
it
seemed
to
be
missing
something
just
did
not
have
flavors
that
carried
its
way
through
the
flavors
that
i
pick
up
are
a
sweet
malt
flavor
that
just
seems
slightly
blah
to
me
also
finishes
noticeably
dry
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
based
on
the
presentation
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
in
both
of
the
areas
of
taste
and
aroma
i
wonder
if
this
beer
would
be
better
from
the
bottle
or
a
fresh
keg
not
sure
how
long
this
one
had
been
on
anyway
it
is
a
serviceable
beer
just
did
not
meet
expectations
drinkability
quaffable
but
not
memorable
certainly
an
improvement
over
the
regular
warsteiner
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
cola
like
not
much
head
either
smells
malty
and
sweet
alcohol
stings
the
tounge
at
first
chocolately
malt
is
delightful
little
to
no
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
warm
and
full
a
little
too
watery
overall
but
still
a
good
beer
drinkable
yes
however
this
is
not
my
favorite
dunkle
i
think
this
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
in
the
flavor
profile
but
it
is
a
good
refreshing
beer
with
a
light
body
and
more
flavor
than
your
average
pils
drinkability
for
as
dark
and
heavy
as
this
beer
is
its
suprisingly
drinkable
although
more
than
a
couple
would
fill
you
up
pretty
good
d
pleasant

abv
beer
it
was
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
simple
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
and
taste
of
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
honey
having
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
overall
not
to
bad
seems
to
lack
the
body
leaving
it
a
bit
thin
and
and
having
a
dry
finish
d
alright
i
dont
think
i
will
bother
with
it
again
sessionable
but
i
actually
prefer
guinness
which
i
would
say
has
a
similar
enough
flavor
to
act
as
substitute
drinkability
not
in
my
regular
stock
but
if
you
keep
pouring
this
one
im
going
to
keep
drinking
them
some
caramel
flavors
stand
out
in
this
one
but
not
much
else
i
would
say
this
is
a
little
above
average
worth
a
try
never
had
a
german
beer
before
was
very
suprised
as
how
well
it
went
down
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
just
not
sure
ill
choose
it
over
others
when
the
selection
is
considerable
this
is
not
very
good
and
i
think
it
is
overrated
id
rather
keep
smelling
it
than
taste
it
some
more
the
hops
are
important
enough
but
the
malts
behind
are
somewhat
impotent
there
is
a
ghosting
of
roasted
malts
but
otherwise
i
cant
really
tell
its
a
dunkel
cheers
pours
a
very
dark
brown
amber
color
with
a
short
offwhite
head
that
gives
way
to
a
thin
lace
nose
is
dark
bready
malts
along
with
a
bit
of
hazelnut
taste
begins
with
a
roasted
maltiness
followed
by
a
bit
of
coffee
and
some
mildly
bitter
hops
finishes
a
bit
dry
an
easy
drinking
dunkel
that
seems
to
need
a
bit
more
character
the
brew
finishes
dry
and
has
a
medium
body
this
is
a
brew
that
id
probably
not
buy
again
theres
got
to
be
better
out
there
this
is
just
soso
middle
of
the
line
nothing
to
write
home
about
mouthfeel
is
not
thin
but
is
not
overpoweringly
sticky
i
found
this
beer
fairly
drinkable
and
on
those
times
when
i
want
something
very
malty
i
should
add
in
the
interest
of
full
disclosure
that
im
usually
looking
for
something
hoppy
i
would
not
rule
this
out
drinkability
is
okay
but
not
my
brew
of
choice
poured
a
ruby
brown
with
quickly
reducing
head
down
to
a
ring
i
taste
mostly
malts
with
a
bit
of
toasted
malts
or
coffee
at
the
end
this
beer
finishes
very
quickly
almost
no
aftertaste
at
all
since
there
is
nothing
to
offend
at
all
it
is
quite
drinkable
even
pleasant
but
there
are
better
beers
around
overall
this
beer
was
fairly
bland
but
ive
had
worse
taste
was
familiar
for
a
dunkel
lager
but
seemed
watered
down
lacked
complexity
and
compelling
flavor
if
youre
into
buying
inoffensive
imports
and
arent
afraid
of
beer
with
color
this
ones
for
you
if
you
like
fullflavored
brews
pass
drinkabilityoverall
this
dunkel
isnt
going
to
blow
you
away
with
complexity
but
if
nothing
else
is
available
at
the
time
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
im
sure
ill
cross
paths
with
this
lager
again
prost
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
no
outstanding
qualities
although
the
taste
doesnt
compel
me
to
open
another
bottle
the
heaviness
is
negligible
so
if
its
your
thing
i
could
see
drinking
more
than
a
few
d
not
earthmoving
but
definitely
a
nice
beer
i
was
pleased
to
see
it
on
tap
and
will
get
it
again
on
tap
in
a
kings
pint
small
head
fell
quickly
to
nothing
not
even
surface
bubbles
too
dark
to
determine
clarity
a
solid
middleoftheroad
dark
lager
comparable
to
mexican
dark
lagers
but
slightly
maltier
with
less
head
little
body
to
back
up
the
color
even
for
a
dark
lager
i
was
really
disappointed
by
this
beer
so
much
so
that
i
think
it
may
have
just
been
a
bad
sample
i
used
to
drink
this
occassionally
before
i
started
rating
and
trying
various
beers
and
i
liked
it
but
ill
go
with
what
i
had
tonite
poured
to
a
medium
brown
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
almost
immediately
and
left
little
lacing
aroma
was
almost
skunky
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
flavor
was
nothing
special
and
the
finish
was
very
dry
i
will
most
likely
try
this
one
again
just
to
give
it
a
fair
shot
at
redemption
ahh
one
of
my
favorite
widely
distributed
beers
this
has
a
dark
coffee
like
color
mildy
transparent
not
sure
how
to
explain
it
but
when
i
taste
it
it
gives
me
a
warm
fuzzy
feeling
from
opening
to
tipping
the
bottle
up
it
is
great
tasting
all
the
way
through
very
nice
beer
highly
recommened
i
have
introduced
this
beer
to
many
of
friends
and
have
yet
had
anybody
tell
me
that
it
isnt
good
even
the
just
give
me
a
beer
friends
they
all
seem
to
like
it
a
good
solid
commercial
german
dunkel
no
surprises
but
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
get
my
buzz
onn
slainte
incredibly
thick
and
heavy
aftertaste
that
sits
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
this
is
one
you
may
have
to
choke
down
considering
how
dark
it
is
it
is
relatively
smooth
but
not
one
where
you
can
knock
back
34
of
them
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
warsteiner
malty
rich
with
some
good
hop
spice
warsteiner
premium
dunkel
was
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
and
clear
the
tan
head
soon
dissipated
to
a
thin
layer
but
remained
for
a
while
leaving
a
little
spotted
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
light
and
mostly
malt
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
a
little
roasted
character
the
body
was
just
under
medium
with
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
dark
lager
and
would
make
an
good
session
beer
if
this
were
say
hamms
dark
id
be
really
impressed
but
its
not
so
im
a
bit
pissed
over
all
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
for
what
i
paid
for
it
added
to
the
limp
flavor
it
really
didnt
deliver
very
drinkable
but
i
only
had
one
with
my
meal
brown
but
translucent
body
with
almost
no
carbonation
or
head
interesting
smell
roasty
and
caramel
dominate
tastes
very
roasty
with
caramel
and
coffee
notes
very
very
good
well
balanced
despite
the
presence
of
afformentioned
flavors
and
scents
pretty
good
for
a
lager
drinkability
overall
a
nice
presentation
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
i
grabbed
a
12er
of
this
that
happened
to
be
on
sale
at
the
local
krogers
since
i
love
a
good
dunkel
i
couldnt
resist
the
smell
and
appearance
were
both
average
for
dunkels
i
would
say
there
was
nothing
to
exceptional
worth
noting
anyways
the
taste
was
pretty
good
you
get
a
nice
feel
of
roasted
malts
and
some
sweetness
blended
in
there
for
what
i
would
call
a
good
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
smooth
all
around
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
but
then
drinkability
is
high
on
most
any
good
beer
edit
i
had
another
one
later
and
it
proved
to
be
more
enjoyable
the
second
time
around
im
bumping
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
up
just
a
little
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
excellent
clarity
one
finger
of
dense
soapy
head
is
pale
tan
and
shows
decent
retention
with
a
few
specs
of
lacing
pale
and
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
softdark
fruit
aroma
pale
malt
sweetness
upfront
with
toasty
munich
malt
and
a
weak
nutty
flavor
in
the
backgreund
plenty
of
saaz
flavor
mabye
some
hallertau
as
well
dry
aftertaste
again
all
noble
malty
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
are
balanced
and
very
agreeable
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
crisp
but
it
finishes
mostly
clean
with
a
mild
hop
bite
and
some
roasted
notes
the
nonresidual
mouthfeel
is
highly
drinkable
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
dissapointing
bottle
pours
to
a
colalike
appearance
with
minimal
head
that
disappears
quickly
a
very
nice
enticing
aroma
of
sweet
raisins
and
plums
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
pleasant
with
a
nice
balance
of
mild
sweetness
and
bitterness
though
dark
beer
enthusiasts
will
find
it
watery
evidence
of
malt
and
caramel
nice
but
not
outstanding
i
would
have
this
again
though
not
my
first
choice
not
what
i
would
call
drinkable
im
glad
that
there
wasnt
more
in
the
fridge
to
finish
off
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
a
generally
wellmade
example
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
carbonated
with
a
slight
aftertaste
that
is
very
short
in
duration
very
drinkable
ale
due
to
its
light
crisp
nature
and
its
low
alcohol
content
a
great
beer
for
the
summertime
this
is
one
i
bring
to
gettogether
where
most
of
the
people
there
drink
macroswill
this
is
also
one
ill
purchase
if
the
establishment
in
which
i
find
myself
has
nothing
better
this
is
a
favorite
for
backyard
parties
warsteiner
is
probably
one
of
the
best
german
macro
imports
and
the
dunkel
is
even
better
you
dont
have
to
be
a
dark
beer
lover
to
enjoy
it
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
amber
with
a
foamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
mild
hops
and
unlike
the
original
warsteiner
the
hops
are
equally
mild
in
the
taste
nice
mouthful
light
carbonation
and
just
enough
roasted
malt
flavor
to
satisfy
just
enough
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
to
keep
you
wanting
more
excellent
for
an
easy
to
get
german
dark
drinkability
a
nice
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
a
good
widely
available
dunkel
but
not
quite
a
top
notch
dunkel
imo
this
is
a
personal
favorite
and
longtime
tailgating
companion
wonderful
with
brats
highly
recommended
as
a
beer
to
start
the
unwashed
masses
on
the
path
from
megaswills
to
quality
beer
cheers
i
got
this
after
trying
the
verum
and
really
liking
it
dark
lagers
are
kind
of
special
in
a
way
theyre
not
especially
common
here
it
poured
dark
but
not
as
dark
as
a
stout
typically
roasted
flavor
with
a
semisweet
flavor
of
carmelized
sugars
kind
of
a
simple
flavor
without
too
much
depth
typical
of
a
lager
it
could
have
much
more
flavor
the
verum
does
but
i
think
the
roasted
flavor
actually
contributes
to
this
kind
of
a
dull
thin
mouthfeel
not
especially
drinkable
for
a
lager
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
much
more
impressed
with
the
vahrshteiner
verum
so
ill
probably
get
that
instead
next
time
in
comparison
with
another
beer
of
the
same
style
however
it
is
lightyears
ahead
of
modelo
negro
even
after
drinking
modelo
with
wisky
it
didnt
taste
as
good
as
the
warsteiner
if
by
chance
youre
a
modelo
fan
try
this
instead
you
might
like
it
better
drank
okay
on
a
warm
spring
day
in
a
nice
biergarten
here
in
the
citys
oldest
german
restaraunt
edelweiss
i
dont
think
that
unduly
influnce
my
score
but
it
didnt
hurt
overall
much
better
than
you
average
garden
variety
import
beerworth
a
try
pretty
good
beer
really
great
dunkels
are
hard
to
come
by
in
my
experience
but
this
one
isnt
bad
at
all
overall
impression
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
but
highly
drinkable
nice
session
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
taste
is
better
than
the
nose
thankfully
with
a
creamy
succulent
mouthfeel
caramel
and
roasted
malt
are
the
main
flavor
components
not
overly
comples
hence
a
uncanny
smoothness
making
the
beer
fairly
drinkable
a
very
drinkable
dark
lager
and
a
good
looking
one
too
sweeter
than
the
regular
warsteiner
but
by
no
means
is
this
a
bock
beer
if
you
like
lots
of
toasted
grain
taste
and
mild
hop
levels
then
this
beer
is
for
you
the
phrase
liquid
bread
applies
to
this
beer
what
a
beer
goes
down
easy
with
its
nice
robust
flavor
from
the
roasted
malts
it
really
goes
down
smooth
light
but
rich
in
flavor
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
bratwurst
or
some
knackwurst
grab
one
of
these
on
draft
and
dont
be
afraid
of
the
dark
opinion
i
have
had
this
beer
on
multiple
occasions
and
i
must
say
that
as
the
first
beer
of
the
evening
it
tastes
a
lot
better
than
i
have
had
it
before
it
has
a
rich
malty
profile
that
really
is
akin
to
a
munich
dunkel
i
think
that
the
dark
caramel
malts
were
a
bit
much
and
the
beer
would
do
a
bit
better
by
supplementing
some
caramunich
for
the
crystal
still
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
one
that
i
will
surely
be
drinking
again
poured
a
mildly
hazy
deep
mahoganybrown
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
smell
is
malty
and
slighly
buttery
hints
of
raisin
bread
some
faint
hops
taste
is
crisp
but
rich
maltiness
again
some
raisin
qualities
some
diacetyl
caramel
slight
dark
fruitbread
flavors
some
balancing
hops
but
not
very
bitter
at
all
quite
delicious
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
bready
aftertaste
coating
the
tongue
for
a
second
i
found
this
dunkel
lager
to
be
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
kind
of
a
decent
quality
darkened
and
sweetened
macro
lager
overall
good
all
around
beeri
love
warseiner
so
i
could
be
biased
here
flavor
is
basically
malty
goodness
with
solid
doses
of
caramel
and
some
chocolate
highlights
id
call
this
one
hearty
but
really
misses
some
depth
came
off
more
as
a
medium
bodied
well
done
homebrew
overall
quite
average
very
meh
this
is
not
a
perfect
beer
but
it
is
a
perfectly
drinkable
beer
complex
yet
simple
it
explores
the
world
of
your
tongue
without
challenging
or
offending
it
this
is
why
we
drink

the
sour
experience
would
actually
be
lower
but
i
took
the
middle
ground
well
within
the
best
by
date
verdict
a
nice
option
as
an
easydrinking
pub
beer
overall
impression
is
that
i
feel
itll
take
me
very
little
effort
to
finish
the
six
pack
tonight
its
the
sort
of
beer
that
is
unobtrusive
enough
to
not
have
to
take
center
stage
yet
i
find
myself
looking
at
it
every
so
often
and
admiring
its
complex
yet
humble
character
there
was
a
faint
sort
of
spice
that
presented
itself
after
the
beer
warmed
up
a
little
but
that
was
about
it
when
it
was
all
said
and
done
the
glass
was
the
best
part
of
the
experience
last
swigs
seems
to
be
a
spot
on
version
of
the
dunkel
style
with
a
bit
of
root
beer
meets
grain
mediumdark
color
smooth
and
very
drinkable
fairly
light
bodied
i
feel
for
a
dark
beer
dark
roasted
taste
slight
bitterness
that
quickly
dissipates
also
the
head
is
good
light
cream
to
it
but
also
dissapears
fairly
quick
lacing
lasted
for
a
while
a
beer
i
will
definetly
drink
again
when
the
time
is
right
dark
brown
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
at
all
i
tried
this
one
from
draft
not
too
dark
but
just
dark
enough
to
offer
the
basic
flavors
that
should
come
with
a
dark
beer
roasty
malt
caramel
slight
cocoa
raisen
on
the
bitter
side
for
me
too
much
hopps
maybe
also
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
for
me
forcing
me
to
do
a
fair
bit
of
burping
finish
is
fairly
smoth
nice
and
clean
however
leaving
that
dark
roasted
flavor
lingering
which
is
nice
enjoyed
at
castle
on
king
in
kitchener
on
clear
dark
chestnut
beer
topped
by
a
tan
head
with
some
lacing
spicy
malty
nose
with
a
bit
more
roast
and
noble
hops
in
the
flavour
slightly
yeasty
dry
finish
with
lingering
malt
character
overall
a
decent
drink
pours
a
appreciative
dark
brown
with
a
halffinger
creamy
head
that
doesnt
linger
long
smells
sweetly
of
a
coffeecaramel
aroma
with
smoky
overtones
of
malt
lighter
than
that
of
a
traditional
german
dunkel
but
not
watery
by
any
means
still
a
filling
brew
great
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
present
but
not
overpowering
considering
the
weight
of
the
beer
this
was
one
of
my
first
german
beers
would
definitely
recommend
for
anyone
just
getting
into
german

try
it
this
is
a
very
solid
everyday
session
beer
i
think
i
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
with
food
not
as
good
as
capitals
munich
dark
but
still
a
good
beer
i
was
quite
suprised
by
this
brew
very
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
poured
out
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
14
inch
head
of
cream
colored
foam
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
roasted
malts
grain
and
earth
taste
was
rather
complex
flavors
of
nuts
roased
malt
herbs
and
grain
were
well
blended
and
kept
the
palate
entertained
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
making
this
brew
good
for
nearly
any
time
of
day
or
year
good

i
will
be
looking
for
this
in
bottles
next
trip

the

a
finely

i
would
say
to
anyone
who
enjoys
dark
malty
brews
to
give
this
one
a
sample
the
4
9
make
this
a
good
brew
for
the
duration
ill
be
picking
up
more
for
the
fall
season
or
ill
be
back
at
the
foxhound
for
more
a
fairly
straightforward
brew
doesnt
really
wow
me
but
you
can
easily
toss
back
quite
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
pours
a
dark
coffee
brown
with
a
tiny
head
that
dissipates
quickly
sweet
and
mildly
herbal
aroma
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
dark
carmel
malts
of
course
with
hints
of
raisin
and
a
tealike
flavor
as
well
not
really
as
impressive
as
it
sounds
still
despite
not
breaking
any
new
ground
this
is
a
simple
and
tasty
dunkel
worth
a
try
notes
refreshing
brew
not
much
else
to
say
this
is
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
to
be
sneezed
at
either
very
drinkable
and
frankly
i
dont
see
many
dunkel
lagers
around
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
presented
itself
in
a
chestnut
brown
hue
with
a
medium
to
light
head
smelled
crisp
and
clean
with
no
unpleasantness
taste
was
pleasant
with
a
big
malty
flavor
along
with
hints
of
cocoa
and
coffee
mouthfeel
felt
only
slightly
carbonated
with
an
absence
of
aftertaste
certainly
an
adequate
addition
to
the
refrigerator
on
a
year
round
basis
a
good
yet
simple
dunkel
to
round
out
ones
selection
light
bodied
actually
a
little
thin
but
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
decent
but
nothing
special
this
is
a
solid
german
dunkel
heavy
on
the
malts
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
a
mediocre
dark
brew
it
pours
a
nice
brownish
stain
look
with
little
to
no
head
but
that
head
that
does
exist
is
very
sticky
the
aromas
i
couldent
put
my
finger
on
and
the
taste
was
a
little
lite
for
a
darker
brew
it
had
a
crisp
dry
finish
with
little
to
no
bite
and
maybe
a
little
to
much
carbonation
edit
in
recent
years
ive
seen
this
showing
up
superfresh
in
paper
sealed
cases
with
dates
on
them
when
you
find
one
with
a
drink
by
date
thats
58
months
into
the
future
grab
it
its
always
going
to
be
on
the
hoppier
side
compared
to
a
bavarian
dunkel
but
its
still
good
a
smooth
and
tempting
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
pretty
good
beer
i
cant
wait
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
sixer
i
bought
dunkels
along
with
some
scottish
ales
are
the
only
dark
beers
i
drink
in
summer
this
one
has
earned
a
place
in
my
refridgerator
to
compliment
my
steak
and
potatoes
all
in
all
a
solid
offering
from
one
of
germanys
big
importers
warsteiner
dunkle
is
dark
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
an
averagesized
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
of
generic
german
toasted
malts
not
a
bad
aroma
but
nothing
outstanding
the
taste
is
all
toasted
and
bready
german
malts
a
little
grain
flavor
comes
into
play
towards
the
finish
the
malt
flavor
here
is
very
good
but
doesnt
have
that
extra
something
to
set
this
beer
apart
from
some
of
the
better
beers
of
this
style
still
this
is
easy
to
find
reliable
and
nicely
priced
this
will
be
in
my
fridge
again
poured
a
beautiful
deep
copper
color
with
slightly
offwhite
quickly
disappearing
head
smell
is
of
caramel
coffee
roasted
grains
taste
is
a
bit
disappointing
becasue
the
promises
of
the
smell
do
not
follow
through
finish
is
a
slight
bitterness
with
caramel
notes
beer
is
good
but
just
does
not
seem
to
excel
in
any
aspect
drinkability
very
clean
and
drinkable
wellmade
appearance
is
a
medium
dark
brown
that
pours
a
creamy
head
with
some
lace
retention
the
aroma
contains
hints
of
vegetable
prune
and
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
average
in
carbonation
dry
and
mild
on
both
hops
and
malt
some
hint
that
the
dunkel
comes
from
caramel
additives
rather
than
cask
aging
the
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
artificial
tasting
not
up
to
warsteiners
standards
with
their
other
beers
this
poured
with
a
surprisingly
nice
head
that
managed
to
do
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
for
a
lager
the
smell
was
malty
bready
caramel
and
burnt
toast
the
flavor
was
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
diacetyl
in
there
making
it
slightly
sticky
i
enjoyed
its
low
carbonation
although
some
may
not
i
think
this
is
a
great
dunkel
and
why
shouldnt
it
be
its
warsteiner
after
all
impression
nicely
balanced
clean
and
crisp
creamy
dark
lager
overall
easy
to
drink
and
rather
refreshing
not
too
shabby
but
ive
had
much
better
bottle
pours
nut
brown
to
mahagoney
with
some
brown
head
as
it
pours
then
completely
dissipates
aroma
is
caramel
and
brown
sugar
malt
with
a
light
chocolate
nose
initial
flavor
is
fizzy
caramel
malt
slightly
toasted
finishes
a
little
hoppy
and
spicy
with
faint
chocolate
notes
medium
bodied
and
fizzy
palate
warming
dark
but
with
strands
of
gold
and
amber
the
head
was
thin
and
rapidly
diminished
overpowering
scent
of
sweet
wheat
and
lightlyspiced
fruits
the
smell
is
very
agreeable
but
not
terribly
complex
tastes
more
of
chocolate
and
pine
sap
than
indicated
by
the
smell
its
very
nice
actually
simple
and
clean

carbonated
i
like
warsteiner
premium
verum
a
lot
i
drink
it
about
45
to
55
of
the
time
this
premium
dunkel
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
it
is
a
shame
that
i
could
not
give
it
higher
marks
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
thick
towering
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
roasted
malt
scent
with
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
it
also
has
a
dry
yeast
scent
as
well
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
dry
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
malts
and
lager
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
dunkel
i
prefer
them
to
be
less
dry
and
sweeter
but
it
goes
down
easy
nonetheless
extremely
dark
brown
sheets
of
ruby
red
highlights
an
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
dried
grains
the
nose
has
some
definite
earthy
characteristics
going
on
a
fine
crisp
mediummouthfeel
sweet
malts
molasses
and
oats
becomes
dry
and
subtle
weak
come
as
you
are
tastings
of
coffee
beans
and
hints
of
earthy
hops
not
too
shabby
drinkability
glad
it
it
was
just
a
tasting
i
couldnt
drink
anymore
of
this
just
more
megabrew
swill
to
me
im
off
the
warsteiner
line
for
good
mouthfeel
it
has
a
good
body
neither
thick
or
thin
lightmedium
carbonation
is
is
on
bland
side
but
very
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
watery
brown
colour
with
odd
old
smell
tastes
like
sucking
on
a
piece
of
cloth
if
you
really
need
to
drink
very
grainy
too
much
carbonation
like
a
club
soda
with
some
cheap
gin
or
scotch
drop
poured
in
some
malts
perhaps
a
hint
of
roast
acidic
overall
a
rather
boring
beer
not
much
really
stood
out
in
this
beer
it
poured
dark
in
color
but
with
a
thin
appearance
the
head
was
thick
and
frothy
the
aroma
was
slightly
malty
the
flavor
was
malty
again
with
a
slightly
creamy
finish
i
could
not
notice
any
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
overall
kind
of
flat
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
toned
down
mild
perhaps
good
as
a
session
beer
hard
to
believe
that
ive
never
had
this
im
generally
not
a
huge
dunkel
fan
and
i
suppose
my
general
lack
of
interest
in
this
beer
echoes
that
sentiment
it
starts
out
decently
enough
a
ruby
tinged
brown
with
an
off
white
1
finger
head
which
quickly
retreated
to
being
merely
lacing
smell
was
not
as
assertive
as
i
was
expecting
roasty
notes
noticably
when
you
inhale
super
deep
some
sweetness
was
also
detected
taste
is
a
little
thin
starts
and
ends
sweet
note
a
whole
lot
of
roast
going
on
very
gulpable
though
id
take
this
over
premium
verum
in
a
pinch
this
is
the
only
beer
to
drink
when
youre
at
a
reds
game
overall
i
expect
a
dunkel
to
be
a
bit
fuller
and
less
astringent
not
bad
but
not
as
great
as
a
great
name
from
germany
should
be
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
for
a
couple
of
reasons
its
extremely
cheap
in
bottle
shops
in
italy
as
is
most
beer
and
its
extremly
drinkable
poured
a
decent
haed
that
dissapeared
really
fast
it
had
the
smell
and
taste
of
roasted
malt
and
was
a
little
sweet
which
is
always
good
id
definatly
drink
this
again
because
although
its
nowhere
near
my
favourite
dunkel
it
was
very
drinkable
average
brew
taste
was
ok
as
well
caramel
and
malts
are
the
backbone
to
this
brew
its
a
touch
of
the
sweet
side
but
the
cocoa
balances
the
sweetness
out
wasnt
too
bad
i
gotta
admit
perhaps
it
was
a
little
too
soft
on
the
palate
ontap
this
was
pretty
decent
but
i
dont
know
how
much
better
it
is
in
the
bottle
but
this
was
good
4s
across
the
board
for
this
one
mighty
tasty
indeed
poured
a
rusty
brown
with
a
nice
finger
or
so
head
that
stuck
around
for
about
2
minutes
decent
lacing
smelled
of
hops
and
surprisingly
with
just
a
little
hops
for
character
the
mouth
feel
is
on
the

side

they

hooked
me
up
this
is
loosely
a
german
dark

and
i
think
its
pretty
authentic
the

is
more
like
a
brown

with
some
chocolate
character
more
like
dry
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
caramel
while
staying
dry
and
light
on
the
palate
the
lager
yeast
is
evident
here
it
does
a
nice
job
drying
up
the
finish
and
giving
it
a
seasonally
perfect
crispness
im
not
sure
why
i
expected
this
to
be
darker
and
heavier
like
a
porter
but
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
its
lightness
overall
the
grain
captures
all
the
darker
flavors
but
drinks
like
a
blonde
lager
just
easy
down
with
upbeat
carbonation

a
quick
finish
probably
one
of
the
better
american
takes
on

i
have
come

true
to

just

since
the
412
review
a
beer
that
is
definitely
different
fresh
after
1
5
years
it
has
taken
on
a
pretty
strong
raisin
type
flavor
finish
is
long
and
moderately
bitter
still
drinkable
but
now
tastes
like
a
hybrid
dunkeldubbel
its
not
badjust
kind
of
odd
growing
on
me
as
i
finish
it
appears
a
transparent
yet
darker
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
single
finger
of
fizzy
cream
colored
head
that
dissipates
down
to
a
collar
in
about
two
minutes
no
lacing
smells
of
medium
levels
of
dark
roasted
malt
character
with
a
prune
fig
garnish
on
top
tastes
mostly
malty
but
maintains
strict
levels
of
dryness
throughout
with
a
strong
level
of
carbonation
on
a
lighter
body
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
worse
than
this
one
for
the
style
and
they
kind
of
nailed
it
its
dark
ruby
and
smells
like
cereal
malt
german
yeast
and
fruit
the
worst
part
is
the
middle
which
is
a
little
too
sour
for
the
style
the
best
part
is
the
end
where
the
yeast
rubs
up
against
the
bitter
malt
and
a
lit
wee
bit
of
spicy
hop
and
dark
and
ashen
and
refreshing
d
good
beer
to
go
back
to
back
with
refreshingly
light
in
taste
but
with
a
quality
that
is
savory
very
nice
well
put
together
and
certainly
a
bold
flavor
overall
this
is
an
ok
dark
lager
but
not
worth
a
repeat
buy
overall
a
decent
munich
dunkel
good
bit
of
roasted
malt
flavor
very
average
light
with
not
much
going
on
even
for
a
session
lager
a
bit
on
the
boring
side
d
not
my
favorite
capital
nor
the
best
dunkel
there
are
much
better
out
there
that
being
said
i
could
easily
down
a
6
pack
of
this
average
second
the
style
listed
herein
on
beer
advocate
is
a
dunkel
some
other
lesser
regarded
but
more
commercial
site
i
didnt
say
ratebeer
here
said
dunkel
too
cd
is
a
bit
too
tight
and
malty
to
carry
the
description
of
dunkel
but
cd
retains
some
of
the
crisper
flavors
of
dunkel
to
warrant
it
more
of
its
cousin
theres
enough
of
a
hint
of
dunkel
in
cd
to
know
its
in
the
family
but
it
has
different
parents
dork
or
dunkel
lets
just
say
cd
is
rather
like
a
blend
of
munich
lager
with
some
dunkel
added
drink
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
down
a
6
pack
d
drinkability
is
definitely
good
this
is
a
dark
beer
to
scare
your
friends
with
then
watch
their
surprise
at
it
smoothness
and
lightness
i
just
wish
this
was
more
like
a
true
munich
dunkel
sort
of
like
a
doppelbock
in
character
without
the
high
abv
kick
d
very
nice
well
put
together
and
certainly
a
bold
flavor
overall
another
solid
lager
from
capital
they
sure
do
love
the
lagers
d
truthfully
not
one
of
my
most
favorite
styles
but
this
is
rather
good
for
what
it
is
fits
the
style
well
and
works
well
as
something
for
the
early
fall
season

an

flavorful
lager
not
world
class
but
id
have
another
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
clear
dark
amber
when
held
to
the
light
has
a
great
red
hue
there
was
a
1
finger
off
white
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
cap
the
aroma
is
a
spicy
with
some
dark
malt
notes
and
a
slight
molasses
hint
the
taste
is
malty
upfront
with
some
dried
fruit
in
the
back
plums
raisins
and
burnt
caramel
the
brew
is
a
little
thin
and
the
light
carbonation
could
be
a
little
stronger
this
is
an
ok
brew
but
not
really
a
bold
dark
lager
as
i
like
tasty
brew
heres
to
subtlety
pleasent
on
the
tongue
and
very
easy
going
down
i
was
thinking
i
could
drink
alot
of
these
drinks
pretty
easy
a
good
shot
at
the
style
by
far
the
best
of
the
3
capital
brews
sent
here
to
oklahoma
recently
do
not
impressed
overall
dont
know
that
id
want
anymore
than
one
of
these
even
though
id
call
it
a
session
brew
this
is
a
dark
redblack
beer
with
a
mild
coffee
ground
and
grape
aroma
its
light
bodied
and
fizzy
with
coffee
cherry
and
cola
with
a
nice
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
it
goes
down
very
easy
which
might
be
the
best
thing
for
a
dark
lager
it
doesnt
have
anything
to
bring
me
back
though
d
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
and
the
low
abv
definitely
lends
to
its
sessionability
i
probably
wont
make
it
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
but
it
was
certainly
worth
a
try
the
nose
could
be
a
little
stronger
and
the
carbonation
is
a
little
higher
than
i
expected
i
think
that
may
be
why
my
impression
only
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
rested
overall
great
beer
that
will
serve
well

noble

i
swear
to

quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
yes
another
excellent
lager
from
capital
which
is
certainly
under
rated
in
my
opinion
on
this
site
complex
yet
approachable
ill
definately
be
drinking
this
one
again
a
pretty
average
brew
pours
a
clear
red
with
some
brown
and
a
foamy
tan
head
nose
is
mostly
roasted
malts
but
with
some
hints
of
sweetness
taste
is
bitter
hops
some
malts
and
a
slight
smokiness
mouthfeel
is
ok
if
thin
drinkability
is
average
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
if
you
dig
the
taste
this
could
easily
be
an
allnighter
very
good
drinkability
combining
all
the
ingredients
necessary
do
not
disappoint
and
serve
this
beer
too
cold
as
i
did
with
my
first
one
it
really
opens
up
when
served
at
50
degrees
or
warmer
im
not
completely
sold
on
the
combination
of
flavors
sadly
i
drank
it
too
fast
to
find
my
complaint
i
guess
it
wasnt
so
bad
afterall
ill
need
another
and
another
to
find
out
my
problem
and
im
sure
by
then
id
have
to
admit
i
dont
know
mouthfeel
is
frankly
ordinary
drinkablility
is
very
high
its
interesting
and
quite
sessionable
if
this
was
available
in
these
parts
it
would
be
a
regular
for
me
for
sure
drinkability

this
went
down
well
enough
it
was
quite
uneventful
which
is
a
plus
for
the
style
i
liked
this
one
it
was
very
malty
and
had
a
strong
roasted
flavor
to
it
its
a
nice
chocolate
brown
with
a
light
head
thats
off
white
the
smell
was
unremarkable
giving
more
of
the
lager
aroma
than
any
hops
or
malts
mouthfeel
is
full
but
you
know
that
its
not
a
stout
or
something
that
demands
to
be
chewed
id
drink
a
few
more
of
these
if
i
had
them
and
sadly
i
dont
taken
from
the
fridge
of
dirtylou
drinkability
while
this
beer
isnt
light
on
flavor
it
doesnt
develop
much
by
way
of
complexity
but
as
far
as
the
style
goes
this
is
a
good
rendition
the
finish
is
perfect
and
the
flavors
are
balanced
i
could
certainly
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
appreciate
the
understated
character
against
more
heavily
engineered
attempts
at
dark
lagers
fully
transparent
copper
with
a
thin
creamy
beige
head
and
cherry
red
hues
smells
of
caramel
roasted
malts
bakers
chocolate
and
german
hops
toasty
medium
smooth
body
slightly
powdery
very
authentic
taste
matches
aroma
with
the
clear
addition
of
plum
sessionable
i
have
tasted
this
with
other
wisconsin
dark
lagers
and
never
had
it
the
top
and
never
at
the
bottom
for
that
matter
but
it
sure
tastes
great
on
its
own
today
very
enjoyable
looks
like
cola
and
has
a
poor
white
head
smells
are
faint
but
i
get
a
tiny
bit
of
apples
and
caramel
or
chocolate
malts
flavors
are
mainly
malts
caramel
and
very
very
slight
chocolate
hops
are
very
faint
but
there
are
also
some
sour
or
cidery
flavors
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
thin
and
there
is
a
bit
of
astringency
i
can
pretty
fairly
say
this
is
the
worst
capital
beer
ive
had
as
nearly
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
lacking
in
some
way
i
tend
to
be
hard
on
capital
because
1
i
used
to
drink
it
damned
near
everyday
and
2
it
is
one
of
my
favourite
breweries
when
i
joined
ba
i
was
simply
spoiled
on
their
beer
not
intensely
complex
as
is
the
case
with
many
lagers
but
what
it
lacks
in
depth
it
makes
up
for
in
refinement
and
definition
very
easy
drinking
flavorful
and
delicious
quite
refined
and
authentic
just
as
good
as
the
imported
stuff
from
bavarias
capitol
this
ones
a
gem
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
but
not
watery
in
any
way
a
drinkable
beer
suitable
more
for
october
or
march
in
minnesota
opinion
first
of
all
i
must
mention
that
i
am
really
picky
about
this
style
and
i
really
like
them
to
be
lowoctane
bocks
this
beer
is
still
pretty
low
octane
but
it
seems
like
it
was
brewed
primarily
with
the
wrong
base
malt
like
us
2row
this
leaves
the
beer
dry
and
grainy
there
is
some
caramunich
and
crystal
malts
thrown
in
to
make
the
beer
taste
heavier
but
this
doesnt
make
up
for
the
fact
that
there
should
have
been
a
larger
percentage
of
munich
malt
used
in
the
grist
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
an
americanized
german
lager
not
as
bad
as
shiner
bock
or
the
likes
but
still
lacking
roundness
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
reddish
edges
the
head
is
twofingers
in
height
creamy
light
tan
in
color
and
recededs
quickly
into
a
solid
cap
which
covers
the
liquid
nicely
the
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
more
caramel
it
is
rather
simple
but
very
strong
and
pleasing
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
aroma
although
the
caramel
taste
is
a
little
less
intense
than
the
overall
malty
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonationl
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
it
is
very
sessionable
and
definaitely
something
i
will
buy
again
drinkabilty
would
be
higher
if
not
for
the
mouthfeel
uf
pours
a
dark
mahogany
remeniscent
of
a
dark
brown
ale
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
bready
and
malty
got
nostalgic
for
my
newcastle
days
taste
is
yeasty
with
toasted
bicuit
roasted
coffee
lactose
and
a
bit
of
belgianstyle
dark
fruits
this
seems
like
a
melting
pot
of
dark
beers
to
me
a
melange
of
english
brown
ale
oatmealsweet
stout
and
a
mild
belgian
a
bit
scatterbrained
perhaps
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
velvety
smooth
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
until
the
lacotse
sweetness
got
to
me
a
lot
more
character
than
i
would
have
thought
here
glad
i
gave
it
a

12
ounce

some

overall
my
first
dunkel
and
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
im
not
all
that
familiar
with
dunkel

a
style

i
think
this
beer
is
great
plenty
of
flavour
really
drinkable
and
moreish
caramel

honey
full
and
very
nicely

not

there
may
be

there
like

but
this
one
is

good

overall
ok
i
was
expecting
more
but
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
o
a
very

beer
that
as
my
first
dunkel
lager
leaves
a
strong
impression
i
would
come
back
to
this
over
and
over
again
as
drinking
this
is
a
pleasant
experience

even

malts
and
hops

very
good

dr
if
the
open
wasnt
so
dry
i
could
down
pint
after
pint
but
this
beer
doesnt
go
for
repeated
session
style
drinking
its
meant
to
be
enjoyed
give
it
a
go
lads
d
as
far
as
i
know
this
was
only
my
third
dunkel
beer
and
i
liked
it
a
lot
very
drinkable
and
pretty
refreshing
though
i
wouldnt
want
one
on
a
90
degree
day
would
pair
exceptionally
well
with
a
steak
or
with
smoked
meats

dunkel
is
just
too
much
to
type
is
typical
of
dark
wheat
beer
but
certainly
better
than
most
in
all
respects
its
taste
hints
of
caramel
molasses
and
honey
but
neither
flavor
is
overpowering
nor
do
they
detract
from
klds
surprisingly
easy
drinkability
i
first
tried
it
in
the
tourist
town
of
rudisheim
on
the
rhine
river
i
was
immediately
impressed
with
the
beers
taste
far
and
away
the
best
dunkelweiss
i
have
ever
had
but
was
later
even
more
impressed
at
how
unfilling
and
light
kld
was
for
a
typically
heavy
style
of
beer
im
sure
the
calorie
count
doesnt
reflect
this
however
even
if
they
do
go
down
like
a
domestic
light
an
extremely
well
place
leanness
to
this
dunkel
which
makes
it
in
this
case
susceptible
to
aging
conflicts
this
beer
was
a
bit
metalic
but
not
overpoweringly
so
malt
is
toasty
perfect
with
a
subtle
sour
apple
a
one
dimensional
toasty
not
sweet
and
somewhat
appetite
inducing
dvery
nice
beer
nice
with
food
not
outstanding
but
very
good
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
overall
not
the
best
dunkel
i
had
while
touring
germany
it
was
nice
to
broaden
my
experience
with
the
style
but
i
would
be
unlikely
to
purchase
this
again
have
some
bread
with
cheese
or
sausage
with
this
this
will
go
down
in
history
not
as
the
best
beer
ive
had
or
even
the
best
dunkel
but
the
beer
my
friendcustomer
david
brought
back
for
me
from
deutschland
after
having
a
stroke
who
does
that
what
a
man
for
a
dunkel
beer
the
beer
is
not
that
darknice
to
drink
beer
is
a
nice
mahogany
brown
with
a
good
head
and
light
carbonation
the
smell
is
like
roasted
caramel
sort
of
sweet
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
bitterness
it
has
a
balanced
flavor
with
a
medium
body
that
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
which
seems
to
go
best
with
food
d
certainly
goes
down
quickly
and
without
any
fuss
not
the
best
dunkel
out
there
but
this
would
certainly
make
a
good
session
beer
d
good
bavarian
style
dunkel
nice
balance
clean
fits
nicely
with
the
style
rich
and
nicely
aromatic
but
lacks
in
the
full
flavor
have
had
better
more
complex
examples
d
good
example
of
a
dunkel
nice
enough
but
not
outstanding
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
dunkel
and
supremely
quaffable
recommended
i
find
myself
liking
this
more
as
subsequent
sips
follow
the
light
body
and
slighty
sweet
nutty
character
would
play
really
well
against
a
spelt
encrusted
seared
venison
loin
with
a
barley
risotto
and
porcini
mushrooms
to
complement
the
nutty
character
of
the
brew
well
crafted
and
i
look
foward
to
trying
it
again
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
decent
beer
this
is
a
safe
tastey
dunkel
nice
deep
brown
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
faded
quickly
with
decent
lacing
malty
and
slightly
sweet
nothing
in
the
upfront
taste
to
offend
mouthfeel
was
pretty
much
the
same
with
hints
of
chocolate
a
bit
thin
finish
was
bitersweet
chocolate
nothing
overpowering
nothing
to
make
it
very
memorable
either
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
for
the
type
and
nothing
i
would
turn
down
or
try
again
if
given
the
chance
a
sickly
sweetness
did
arrive
in
the
aftertaste
and
i
also
thought
it
a
bit
thinwatery
there
was
some
metalic
hint
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
also
hence
the
average
scores
for
a
beer
i
had
high
hopes
for
last
of
the
beers
i
brought
back
from
germany
this
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
deep
brown
color
with
an
odd
similarity
to
a
cola
the
carbonation
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
there
was
a
thin
tan
cap
with
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
doughy
and
there
is
a
hint
of
nuts
the
taste
is
extremely
thin
and
carbonated
there
is
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
slight
bitter
after
taste
i
have
to
say
for
being
the
last
beer
i
have
from
germany
i
am
a
little
disappointed
this
is
very
light
in
all
of
its
characteristics
with
a
light
to
medium
body
its
a
decent
session
beer
solid
aroma
of
cocoa
dough
and
raisins
dense

leaves
a
few
strands
of

as
it
slowly
fades
dark

colored

with
an

hue
around
the
edges
flavors
of
cocoa
and
dark
roasted

fairly
clean
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
dark

astringency
a
really
good
dunkel
and
an
allaround
solid
beer
d
a
bit
of
a
subparaverage
dunkel
for
me
not
enough
chocolately
notes
and
a
bit
thin
on
the
ground
erdinger
dunkel
beats
this
easy
a
beer
that
is
in
between
a
munich
and
a
doppelbock
more
towards
the
latter
good
beer
good
brew
nice
for
a
hothummid
night
wish
i
drank
it
colder
straightforward
beer
that
i
wish
had
a
bit
more
body
but
that
said
what
it
lacks
in
depth
and
robustness
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
all
in
all
i
like
it
very
much
its
my
standard
afterworkbeer
after
all
edit
on
a
later
trip
i
found
this
to
be
much
better
perhaps
the
tourist
trap
i
bought
this
one
at
just
had
an
old
keg
lovely
malty
dark
lager
from
the
brewery
of
the
ancient
bavarian
kings
classy
dark
brown
colour
the
head
is
not
too
foamy
nor
firm
the
malty
smell
is
matched
by
the
palate
which
ends
in
a
dark
coffee
like
aftertaste
the
brew
is
remarkably
dry
for
a
dark
lager
and
has
a
light
to
medium
body
which
makes
is
very
accesible
final
thought
this
is
a
solid
dunkel
with
a
little
more
depth
than
a
warsteiners
version
the
appearance
is
a
dark
black
just
like
a
cocacola
the
smell
is
a
great
dark
beer
smell
but
not
very
noticeable
unless
you
are
really
searching
for
it
this
beer
is
a
very
addictive
one
you
drink
it
get
the
bitterness
the
wetness
then
it
dries
out
and
you
just
want
more
and
keep
drinking
it
i
always
have
to
put
just
one
or
two
in
the
fridge
at
a
time
or
else
it
all
disappears
the
only
downfall
is
it
is
only
available
in
my
region
ounce
a
year
on
tap
and
is
like
searching
for
a
needle
in
the
haystack
to
find
it
bottled
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
smooth
with
the
bitterness
leaving
you
addicted
to
it
for
the
german
dunkel
beers
i
have
found
few
as
strong
of
flavor
as
this
taste
is
all
present
very
malty
with
a
roasted
caramel
aftertaste
very
drinkable
with
an
ok
mouthfeel
in
the
end
it
is
a
bit
heavy

over
the

nice
thick

the

liquid
the
head
slowly
drifted
away

the
taste
was
wonderful
matching
what
i
have
expected
in
a
well
made
dunkel
no
adverse
bitterness
and
a
smooth
malt
aftertaste
that
lingered
softly
on
the
tongue
the

flavors
of

are

heavy

feel
finishes
semisweet
a
very
tasty
yet
easy
drinking
lager
beer
very
good
beers
its
heavy
dark
beer
but
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
o
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
satisfies
ones
desire
for
a
sturdy
malt
presence
quite
sweet
toasty
caramel
lots
of
bread
silky
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
at
first
the
raisin
and
dark
bread
flavor
is
a
little
much
for
me
but
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
nice
drinkable
german
beer
o
solid
dunkel
lager
rich
without
being
heavy
complex
without
being
overwhelming
very
sessionable
nice
dark
amber
good
beer
o
i
tend
to
gravitate
toward
the
darker
brown
beers
of
germany
the
bocks
and
dunkels
and
this
is
no
exception
a
very
straightforward
and
traditional
interpretation
with
a
ton
of
great
malt
flavor
and
the
right
amount
of
residual
sweetness
and
bitterness
very
very
good
sometimes
you
just
find
yourself
in
the
mood
for
a
dunkel
and
this
is
always
a
safe
bet
to
reach
for
all
the
beers
these
guys
do
are
real
traditional
and
well
done
and
this
is
one
of
their
best
its
really
really
clear
in
its
deep
amber
color
the
head
is
tall
and
white
but
it
doesnt
last
all
that
long
in
my
glass
this
time
it
smells
like
german
lager
yeast
first
a
sweetish
middle
coppery
malt
base
and
then
an
almost
hefeweizen
yeast
where
subtle
dried
banana
notes
and
white
pepper
spice
ease
in
the
flavor
complexion
is
just
like
the
nose
maybe
a
little
light
on
the
yeast
profile
in
this
one
compared
to
other
examples
of
the
style
but
its
subtlety
there
allows
the
fresh
caramely
grain
to
be
a
little
more
forward
i
dont
think
their
are
multiple
yeasts
in
this
but
it
sure
tastes
and
feels
like
there
are
overall
this
is
awesome
a
super
drinkable
dunkel
too
right
at
5
abv
most
perfect
in
the
fall
but
these
are
fun
to
crack
all
year
too
also
a
wonderful
food
beer
diverse
in
its
pairing
capability
a
fine
beer
to
keep
around
for
the
holidays
too
because
of
its
quality
uniqueness
and
probable
mass
appeal
o
good
but
somewhat
one
note
poured
a
deep
clear
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
mostly
burns
off
but
leaves
some
nice
sticky
tight
lacing
the
is
mild
reminding
me
of
deep
malt
tones
turned
way
down
the
taste
though
brings
it
back
up
with
some
night
fruit
bread
and
earthy
hops
the
body
isnt
heavy
but
it
has
a
nice
thickness
to
it
overall
this
is
amazingly
tasty
awesome
pours
a
rusty
brown
with
a
medium
off
white
head

and
taste
is
sweet
mildly
roasted

and
grains
some

some

dark

plums
ends
with
mild
roasted

and
light

goes
down
smooth
and
easy
a
very
good
and
tasty
brew
overall
this
is
the
best
dunkel
ive
tasted
i
feel
like
most
tend
toward
coffeenuttychocolatey
or
sweetraisinfig
this
one
is
kind
of
in
between
more
bready
than
nutty
with
very
little
raisin
taste
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
raisin
taste
so
this
is
welcome
spectrum
for
a
dunkel
drinking
this
is
like
eating
a
big
piece
of
fresh
baked
dark
crusty
bread
without
the
need
to
chew
overall
a
massive
malt
bomb
and
a
very
tasty
one
at
that
feels
a
bit
heavy
though
at
5
abv
with
ample
residual
sugar
producing
a
fairly
heavy
body
feel
really
tasty
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
good
beer
im
a
little
under
the
weather
so
it
is
impacting
my
taste
will
try
again
in
the
future

overall
for
a

this
is
on
the
slightly
sweeter
side
but
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
a
rather
good

overall
a
great
dunkel
ayinger
never
disappoints
othis
is
a
pleasant
beer
nothing
to
chase
trucks
over
but
certainly
worth
a
drink
i
can
see
drinking
a
lot
of
this
in
the
fall
when
the
weather
starts
to
cool
down
it
would
pair
well
with
football
watching
o
if
i
tried
to
brew
a
porterlager
hybrid
this
is
what
id
aim
for
unfortunately
id
never
want
to
do
this
this
is
another
that
id
not
complain
if
it
was
all
there
was
but
it
lacks
muchness
needs
all
of
its
flavours
to
be
bolder
i
enjoyed
the
paulaner
salvator
doppel
bock
style
much
more
overall
good
beer
overall
not
very
complex
flavors
but
the
ones
i
detect
compliment
each
other
well
mediumlight
carbonation
stocky
body
for
a
dunkel
lager
not
bad
but
considering
all
the
other
beers
ayinger
makes
it
was
a
bit
hard
to
get
too
excited
about
this
one
very
nice
dunkel
with
dark
fruit
and
spice
notes
olive
very
smooth
with
a
bit
of

of

cherry
etc
really
well
balanced
smooth
dunkel
brown
carmel
color
with
a
foggy
appearance
sweet
almost
salty
scent
resembles
potato
chips
flavor
is
sweet
but
not
overbearing
and
somewhat
salty
continuing
with
the
potato
chip
resemblance
not
a
lot
of
bitter
or
hoppy
flavor
makes
it
an
easy
drink
revisiting
one
of
my
first
german
beers
from
my
college
days
ah
nostalgia
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunrise
topazsienna
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
foam
the
noe
comprises
mild
nuts
wheat
bread
light
fruits
in
the
vaguest
possible
sense
and
ahint
of
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
nuts
and
bread
combining
into
a
toffeebrittle
situation
and
the
fruit
coming
out
a
bit
stronger
i
think
i
get
some
dark
greens
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slickish
feel
overall
a
really
solid
dunkel
basically
exactly
what
youd
expect
from
ayinger
the
dryness
is
present
in
the
mouthfeel
and
the
body
is
medium
but
leans
lighter
than
i
expect
it
has
more
than
a
modicum
of
both
crispness
and
smoothness
a
very
easy
drinking
pleasant
dunkel
which
loses
points
for
the
frapidly
diminishing
head
and
crappy
lacing
finishes
with
a
bitterish
darkness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
beautiful
brew
with
that
tall
foam
and
redbrown
glowing
color
from
the
500
ml
bottle
purchased
at
ibis
market
in
mission
hills
i
love
rich
malty
lagers
and
i
dont
know
why
i
dont
drink
them
more
often
than
i
do
this
one
has
all
those
wonderful
melanoidins
as
well
as
extreme
drinkability
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
malt
complexity
but
i
cant
penalize
it
for
that
because
its
not
a
bock
or
doppelbock
its
just
a
classic
example
of
the
dark
lager
style
the
flavors
could
be
appropriate
for
a
doppelbock
id
almost
want
more
body
but
that
may
ruin
it
who
knows
im
starting
to
see
brands
from
this
brewery
more
often
in
my
town
keep
sending
them
please
overall
a
great
beer
id
love
to
try
this
out
on
tap
overall
pretty
solid
enjoyable
tasty
and
very
drinkable
a
really
enjoyable
malt
focused
beer
as
expected
from
the
style
d
this
is
session
beer
meant
for
an
evening
at
the
beer
hall
would
be
great
with
sausages
and
cheeses
which
is
what
i
enjoyed
it
with
recommended
a
goto
beer
during
the
colder
months
this
is
superior
to
most
fall
and
winter
seasonal
fare
an
excellent
maltforward
lager
than
never
fatigues
the
palate
i
love
ayinger
for
several
reasons
the
least
of
which
is
not
the
bottle
and
label
something
overtly
germanish
about
it
with
its
17
oz
dark
glass
bottle
and
poorly
illustrated
picture
of
what
i
can
only
assume
is
brewery
aying
if
youre
looking
for
the
gold
standard
of
dunkels
look
no
further
overall
delightfully
tasty
with
lots
of
chocolate
nuts
and
toffee
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
about
a
1finger
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
from
this
dark
lager
brew
as
is
typical
from
germany
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
roasted
malts
and
caramel
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
but
wasnt
unpleasant
at
all
actually
goes
down
pretty
easy
i
have
had
a
few
other
brews
from
ayinger
in
the
past
and
like
the
others
it
didnt
disappoint
o
this
has
become
my
new
favorite
beer
even
though
im
relatively
new
at
this
i
expected
nothing
less
from
this
brew
45
o
i
enjoy
aying
brews
i
cant
say
this
is
better
than
their
gems
but
its
respectable
it
was
a
good
choice
for
dinner
and
something
id
definitely
drink
again
it
has
the
same
texture
and
thickness
that
make
ayinger
a
renowned
german
brewery
and
its
good
sampling
something
from
germany
thats
not
a
hefe
for
a
change
good
brew
the
beer
appears
a
chestnut
brown
color
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
ruby
thin
tan
head
that
rapidly
fades
to
a
wispy
layer
giving
a
nearly
still
appearance
the
aroma
brings
some
lager
yeast
brown
bread
mild
sweetness
the
taste
follow
suit
with
a
prominent
brown
bread
character
a
touch
of
sweet
and
ripened
dark
fruit
light
in
body
with
low
carbonation
a
decent
beer
to
pair
with
some
german
cuisine
this
was
okay
overall
as
usual
ayinger
has
produced
a
top
notch
version
of
a
munich
dunkel
this
beer
is
one
of
the
reasons
dunkels
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
o
this
beer
surprised
me
its
simple
but
very
tasty
lots
of
malt
flavors
with
good
balance
goes
down
super
easy
great
drinkability
great
example
of
the
style
this
is
one
amazing
beer
it
has
an
incredible
lightness
it
has
every
flavor
that
you
love
about
dark
beer
from
dark
fruit
to
coffee
and
yet
its
light
its
not
chewy
its
not
thick
its
not
too
sweet
the
dry
finish
is
something
to
behold
as
all
that
perfect
toasted
grain
settles
in
to
last
and
linger
in
the
aftertaste
full
spirited
and
vibrant
looks
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
wanted
more
out
of
the
glass
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
taste
is
roasty
and
dry
light
bodied
and
straightforward
very
clean
with
a
slight
toasted
marshmallow
impression
though
not
especially
sweet
at
all
carbonation
seems
light
as
well
though
it
helps
the
drinkability
word
is
that
draft
may
hit
the
states
in
january
made
a
great
pairing
with
spicy
goulash
at
laschets
pours
an
amberbrown
with
limited
light
tan
head
aroma
is
deeply
malty
with
a
potent
ripe
raisinprune
scent
that
is
boozy
and
cloying
but
pleasant
very
interesting
aroma
for
a
thinbodied
lager
palate
is
chalky
chocolate
more
pruneraisin
fruit
brown
bread
pumpernickel
a
hint
of
cola
spice
a
sour
top
note
that
almost
evokes
fresh
citrus
but
probably
more
like
rancid
marmalade
nice
deep
dark
flavors
some
brown
sugar
and
coffee
show
up
and
cling
to
the
palate
along
with
a
bit
of
cardboard
the
faintest
whiff
of
apricot
minimal
hop
bitterness
i
like
this
style
and
this
is
a
good
exemplar
ayinger
is
workmanlike
never
bad
and
always
cleaving
close
to
style
guidelines
carbonation
is
right
where
it
needs
to
be
a
nuttiness
like
bitter
walnuts
accumulates
and
builds
a
bit
some
metallic
notes
that
maybe
detract
a
bit
but
one
can
always
return
to
the
fermented
prune
aroma
and
be
intrigued
overall
a
good
solid
beer
that
is
a
proper
introduction
to
the
style
definitely
worth
at
try
mouth
overall
refreshing
enough
semiclean
on
the
palate
mediumbodied
showing
a
balanced
flavour
profile
but
altogether
not
something
id
drink
for
more
than
a
pint
this
is
yet
another
beer
style
that
doesnt
do
well
in
the
bottled
and
pasteurized
form
its
just
not
delicious
and
not
lively
not
referring
to
the
carbonation
enough
this
beer
tasted
flat
and
boring
ive
had
better
dunkels
a
balanced
and
easy
drinking
dunkel
o
this
a
great
dark
german
lager
extremely
flavorful
and
well
balanced
really
easy
to
drink
too
well
crafted
goes
down
easy
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
to
the
point
a
good
alt
dunkel
tasty
easy
to
drink
overall

great
beer
while
i
drank
it
i
kept
imagining
drinking
it
while
eating
some
sauerbraten
and
black
bread
or
a
smoked
shank
of
pork
with
sauerkraut
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
on
its
own
and
believe
it
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
but
cannot
wait
to
try
it
with
food
maybe
the
next
time
i
am
in
black
mountain
i
will
regardless
if
you
see
this
beer
pick
it
up
i
am
not
an
expert
in
munich
dunkels
but
this
satisfies
a
lot
of
the
styles
characteristics
just
thinking
about
it
as
a
beer
it
is
balanced
and
drinks
refreshingly
not
a
surprise
when
it
comes
to
this
brewery
overall
quite
nice
true
to
a
nice
dark
dunkel
great
malt
characters
soft
complex
decoction
mash
profile
nice
sweetener
flavors
without
the
sweetness
faint
dark
fruits
come
through
and
even
the
slightest
hop
profile
very
drinkable
and
i
could
pound
this
back
in
minutes
if
im
not
careful
this
is
what
i
imagine
drinking
on
a
slightly
chilly
spring
morning
in
germany
this
brew
is
beautiful
deep
dark
and
then
deep
cherry
red
under
the
light
the
taste
is
wellrounded
nothing
stands
out
in
dominance
but
each
part
compliments
the
other
i
was
surprised
by
the
fruity
and
floral
aspects
overall
this
is
beautiful
lager
that
would
make
me
want
to
drink
a
lager
i
would
get
this
again
i
also
love
the
new
design
on
the
bottle
its
a
cleaned
up
and
simplified
revision
of
the
previous
one
my
overall
impression
is
that
i
need
to
drink
more
ayinger
one
of
these
once
in
a
while
would
be
fine
a
sort
of
refamiliarizing
with
the
style
i
imagine
itd
best
enjoyed
in
a
beer
hall
with
pretzels
the
aftertaste
is
mild
and
not
unpleasant
overall
the
beer
does
not
work
it
did
not
survive
the
trip
and
marketing
very
well
they
should
not
bother
with
the
export
unless
it
can
be
done
better
maybe
a
can
i
will
not
buy
it
again
my
initial
pour
created
two
dense
fingers
of
lightbrown
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
a
deepbrown
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
was
rich
with
a
carameltoffeelike
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
flavor
was
definitely
malty
caramel
toffee
molasses
and
even
a
touch
of
smoke
were
all
in
evidence
on
the
tongue
finish
was
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
i
liked
it
but
one
500
ml
bottle
would
be
plenty
for
me
at
one
sitting
i
might
return
to
it
but
not
if
other
things
were
also
available
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
would
be
very
fitting
as
a
session
beer
good
flavor
definitely
enough
to
satisfy
the
taste
buds
and
a
light
enough
body
to
do
it
multiple
times
very
enjoyable
overall
a
great
tasting
and
balanced
beer
o
this
is
the
standard
bearer
for
the
style
and
with
good
reason
its
is
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
distinctly
old
world
bavarian
feel
o
easy
to
drink
though
rather
filling
from
the
heavy
dose
of
malts
in
the
beer
enjoyable
and
it
is
the
classic
example
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
o
overall
a
very
enjoyable
dark
beer
thats
not
heavy
but
is
very
flavorful
another
fine
brew
from
ayinger
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
top
smells
of
dark
dried
fruits
and
darker
and
burnt
sugars
mostly
theres
a
light
bready
malt
aroma
but
that
is
quickly
drowned
out
by
the
other
smells
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
dark
sugars
caramel
crystallized
sugar
prunes
and
raisins
all
meld
together
wonderfully
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
burnt
sugary
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
nice
clean
flavorful
german
lager
maybe
this
beer
just
caught
me
off
guard
but
i
found
it
to
be
just
plain
odd
average
to
above
average
in
appearance
and
smell
but
the
taste
just
left
me
flat
a
tad
overcarbonated
a
little
citrus
zing
at
the
finish
and
even
though
it
has
dunkel
lager
attributes
somehow
this
ayinger
misses
my
mark
i
do
love
a
good
dark
lager
and
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
more
but
ill
leave
this
one
alone
there
are
better
options
o
i
was
not
so
sure
about
this
one
when
i
smelled
it
but
the
taste
was
good
and
it
went
down
very
easily
worth
another
tasting
o
a
decent
dark
lager
ive
had
better
ayinger
products
but
this
is
a
mild
very
drinkable
lager
o
its
a
quality
beer
its
delicious
refreshing
could
be
my
regular
drinking
beer
if
it
was
more
readily
available
price
point
3
1916
9oz
bottle
o
overall
this
is
nice
except
for
the
finish
ill
pick
up
another
to
try
if
the
finish
is
more
pleasant
it
will
become
a
regular
session
beer
if
not
ill
pass
overall
a
fairly
good
dark
lager
more
sweet
than
bitter
interesting
though
lacks
the
it
factor
that
puts
it
into
elite
status
for
that
reason
i
doubt
id
buy
this
again
not
when
it
shares
the
same
shelf
space
with
the
other
ayinger
beers
that
are
amazing
overall
everything
from
ayinger
is
very
good
straightforward
and
simple
almost
commercial
are
they
big
in
germany
and
like
paulaner
always
a
good
bet
when
in
doubt
what
to
drink
i
approve
this
message
and
beer
o
a
finely
crafted
beer
with
great
balance
ayinger
dunked
would
make
for
an
ideal
session
beer
due
to
its
rich
and
interesting
yet
not
too
heavy
or
overly
complex
flavor
profile
smoothness
and
low
abv
despite
doing
everything
well
and
being
very
drinkable
i
dont
see
myself
returning
to
this
often
as
it
isnt
remarkable
enough
to
warrant
trips
up
to
abq
to
pay
3
00
for
a
500
ml
bottle
for
now
slightly
inferior
negro
modelo
will
remain
my
munich
dunkel
of
choice
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
toffee
brown
with
a
tall
creamy
tan
head
some
tiny
bubbles
are
visible
in
this
beer
the
head
dissipates
slowly
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
bready
malts
and
caramel
malts
i
can
pick
up
faint
chocolate
notes
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
bready
and
sweet
there
is
a
nice
mild
caramel
sweetness
and
faint
chocolate
notes
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
creamy
and
crisp
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
another
good
beer
from
the
folks
at
ayinger
nothing
has
yet
to
the
top
the
notorious
celebrator
but
if
i
am
looking
for
a
dark
lager
i
know
where
to
find
it
500

into
pilsener

dating
pours
fairly
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
12

fairly
dense
cream
colored
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
with
plenty
of
carbonation
streaming
up
retaining
the
head
aromas
of
big
brown
bread
caramel
toast
molasses
chocolate
toffee
biscuit
nuttiness
and
light
herbal
hops
damn
nice
aromas
with
good
strength

on

for
a
short

fantastic
amount
of
pretty
robust
flavors
with
great

complexity
medium
carbonation
and

with
a
fairly
creamy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
very
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
dunkel
lager
i
have
never
had
this
style
before
but
this
is
nicely
robust
and
complex
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
very
clean
for
a
lager
as
well
such
a
delicious
brew
if
only
it
was
more
widely
available
drinkability
is
unparalleled
overall
experience
in
exceptional
great
depth
of
flavors
in
perfect
harmony
this
is
exactly
what
a
dunkel
should
be
d
excellent
dunkel
solid
balanced
flavour
profile
that
sends
me
back
to
munich
could
drink
this
all
day
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
had
good
flavors
and
was
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
have
more
than
just
one
o
a
nice
offering
from
ayinger
as
it
warms
it
gets
softer
but
the
flavors
come
out
cold
its
crisper
and
more
taught
but
with
some
of
the
dried
fruits
blending
into
more
of
a
single
fruit
leather
note
mediumheavy
body
with
an
effervescence
that
is
tangy
almost
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
much
more
subdued
elsewhere
aftertaste
is
peatearth
and
light
hops
slightly
drying
with
just
a
light
coating
of
the
upper
palate
very
good
brew
light
feel
very
good
carbonation
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
the
dortmunder
export
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
overall
that
dismal
dunkel
from
the
2012
longshot
sixpack
was
the
impetus
for
this
purchase
and
the
difference
is
night
and
day
overall
excellent
almost
like
a
light
version
of
celebrator
very
drinkable
shows
that
a
high
malt
presence
can
be
just
as
good
as
any
ipa
o
a
fine
malty
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
beer
o
luxurious
lightly
chocolate
n
toffee
flavored
beer
with
a
toasted
aroma
and
finish
a
amazing
beer
on
an
epic
scale
quite
an
excellent
dark
lager
picked
this
guy
up

toasted
malt
flavors
are
the
showcase
light
coffee
flavor
with
a
very
subtle
hint
of
hops
at
the
finish
finishes
clean
and
semidry
a
very
enjoyable
german
lager
nice
light
body
easily
could
polish
off
a
few
of
these
guys
at
a
nice
german
biergarten
flavors
are
not
complex
but
very
nicely
done
m
o
thin
almost
watery
beer
which
is
quite
to
style
great
carbonation
lends
an
all
in
feeling
to
this
one
but
at
the
same
time
is
reserved
enough
for
this
to
be
drunk
very
quickly
the
finish
is
toasty
and
the
malt
sweetness
lolls
about
lazily
on
the
palate
bottom
line
ayinger
altbairisch
dunkel
is
absolutely
one
of
the
best
dunkels
ive
had
to
date
this
brewery
knows
what
they
are
doing
a
very
nice
change
when
i
want
to
cleanse
the
palate
with
something
totally
drinkable
after
a
hop
bomb
or
two
i
have
to
say
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
it
is
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
not
quite
enough
roast
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
slight
lighter
brown
head
nutty
and
malty
aroma
caramel
and
bread
flavor
follows
the
nose
nice
nutty
notes
followed
by
caramel
and
bready
sweetness
toffee
in
there
as
well
a
lesser
but
pronounced
hint
of
dark
fruit
sweetness
finishes
off
this
malty
beast
medium
bodied
not
a
thick
sweet
blend
but
more
of
a
smoother
maltiness
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
toasted
bread
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
but
im
not
sure
if
i
will
try
this
again
ayinger
has
better
offerings
in
my
opinion
candy
is
not
good
im
not
just
talking
about
beer
im
talking
everything
sugary
tasting
things
arent
enjoyable
for
me
i
get
these
things
far
less
in
beer
though
at
least
candy
has
a
market
5
year
old
kids
this
is
beer
why
does
it
taste
like
they
are
making
it
for
people
who
eat
shit
like
cake
btw
for
the
idiots
who
think
im
joking
in
my
reviews
that
was
funny
because
it
is
true
this
beer
sucks
candy
is
sweet
and
uncomplex
stuff
this
beer
is
much
the
same
no
depth
or
anything
to
grab
on
to
o
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
o
now
this
is
a
dunkel
this
is
a
really
great
all
around
beer
much
more
refreshing
than
i
thought
it
would
be
perfect
during
fall
and
winter
overall
i
am
loving
this
fruity
and
nut
and
milky
and
coffee
and
malty
combination
is
that
a
run
out
sentence
or
what
tasty
brew
o
overall
this
has
got
to
be
the
cleanest
tasting
dunkel
iv
ever
had
i
liked
its
smooth
flavors
of
moderate
sweetness
tartness
low
bitterness
and
clean
dry
finish
pretty
darn
good
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
cheers
overall
a
really
good
beer
for
the
season
but
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
having
just
had
the
oktoberfest
marzen
i
had
higher
expectations
this
one
doesnt
measure
up
to
that
beer
in
my
estimation
still
really
good
for
a
dunkel
ayinger
altbairisch
dunkel
is
a
well
made
beer
all
around
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
thick
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
molasses
toast
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
has
molasses
roasted
malt
and
root
beer
notes
with
a
hint
of
anise
its
got
a
lightmedium
mouthfeel
with
mild
cokelike
carbonation
ayinger
altbairisch
dunkel
is
a
good
beer
typical
of
the
style
and
very
drinkable
recommended
the
finish
saves
the
beer
somewhat
with
its
big
caramel
and
hazelnut
flavors
but
the
hop
profile
is
a
little
watery
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
with
a
light
bodied
feel
overall
ive
always
enjoyed
the
ayinger
dunkel
especially
at
3
a
bottle
that
being
said
the
long
journey
has
not
done
this
beer
any
favors
and
it
leaves
me
longing
for
the
fresh
dunkels
on
tap
found
all
over
germany
and
austria
overall
very
complex
munich
malt
flavors
with
nice
hint
of
sweet
toffee
yeasty
bread
crustlike
characters
very
enjoyable
long
on
flavor
lasting
on
my
palate
for
more
than
30
minutes
after
the
final
taste
which
was
nearly
room
temperature
this
lifted
the
curtain
and
confirmed
my
overall
impression
worth
seeking
out
again
a
very
fine
brew
oh
hello
who
are
you
i
must
find
out
i
take
it
to
the
out
of
doors
and
pop
the
top
glass
at
hand
what
a
beautiful
pour
burnt
umber
with
ruby
highlights
a
wispy
creamy
head
delightful
the
beer
quenches
my
thirst
beautifully
with
its
toasty
munich
malts
and
floral
hop
balance
starts
like
its
going
to
be
sweet
but
actually
finishes
only
ever
so
slightly
sweet
i
finish
the
bottle
easily
and
with
great
relish
a
quality
brew
this
beer
pours
to
a
beautiful
bright
deep
chestnut
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
excellent
with
lots
of
good
aromas
of
sweet
malt
light
toast
and
nuts
the
palate
is
round
and
clean
with
lots
of
good
sweet
malt
toast
and
nutty
malt
flavor
this
beer
finishes
with
more
good
malt
character
then
ends
with
enough
herbal
hop
bittereness
to
round
this
one
out
to
perfection
a
great
match
to
hearty
german
fare
and
bbq
dishes
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
2
inch
light
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
random
strings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
malt
and
caramel
notes
perhaps
a
bit
of
an
earthy
aroma
taste
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
caramel
and
some
earthywoody
tastes
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
from
ayinger
and
my
first
of
the
style
i
would
get
this
one
again
poured
into
an
ayinger
weizen
glass
at
schaeffers
tavern
staten
island
fits
perfectly
in
the
glass
pouring
a
clear
toffee
brown
body
with
a
booming
light
coffee
colored
wellretained
head
smells
wonderfully
malty
with
caramel
toffee
notes
a
sweet
and
refreshing
lager
theres
a
small
hop
bite
right
in
the
front
as
the
beer
arrives
on
the
tongue
properly
carbonated
the
moderate
bodied
beer
has
a
crispness
that
goes
well
in
a
breezy
bar
on
an
80
degree
summer
day
0
5l
bottle
served
in
pilsner
glass
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
fizzy
and
quickly
diminishing
light
brown
head
aroma
is
caramel
bread
a
hint
of
toffee
nutty
and
a
hint
of
roast
flavor
is
caramel
nutty
bread
roasted
malt
some
dark
fruits
a
hint
of
spiciness
a
little
bit
of
smoke
and
some
light
noble
and
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
dry
and
slightly
bitter
finish
o
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
definitely
enjoy
one
of
these
again
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
4
5
as
always
ayinger
makes
a
great
brew
tasty
roasted
and
nutty
this
is
an
enjoyable
dunkel
that
you
should
try
if
you
have
the
chance
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
cherry
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
off
white
head
it
smells
of
slightly
sweet
caramel
malts
toffee
and
cream
it
is
very
soft
on
the
nose
it
also
has
a
light
nuttiness
the
flavor
is
of
light
candied
almonds
perhaps
pecans
and
has
a
nice
caramel
toffee
finish
its
pretty
flavorful
for
being
so
light
in
body
it
is
a
very
smooth
drink
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
was
much
better
than
i
anticipated
its
worth
a
try
pours
a
bright
reddishcopper
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
out
of
the
light
its
a
chestnut
brown
thin
tan
head
but
no
real
lacing
cap
sticks
around
throughout
the
nose
brings
some
lightlysweet
malt
along
with
some
caramel
and
a
hint
of
nuts
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
focusing
mostly
on
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
caramel
and
toffee
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
decent
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
o
not
sure
where
that
fruit
character
was
coming
from
perhaps
an
old
bottle
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
o
a
very
pleasant
dunkel
so
smooth
soft
and
sweet
its
grainy
and
sweet
and
everything
you
want
in
a
dunkel
this
brew
packs
alot
of
flavor
in
a
light
body
split
this
bottle
with
a
friend
nice
beer
it
tastes
like
and
really
is
a
classic
dunkel
lager
it
looks
dark
brown
in
my
glass
with
a
short
tan
head
its
dry
and
drinkable
with
a
mildly
bitter
finish
hint
of
spicy
hops
and
crisp
cocoa
and
toasty
bready
malts
clean
delicious
and
sessionable
heck
of
a
lager
this
beer
pours
a
rubybrown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
light
tan
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
caramel
toffee
and
a
nice
mineral
quality
very
pleasing
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
lighter
it
is
still
nice
but
a
bit
too
light
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighterside
of
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
watery
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
there
are
much
better
dunkels
out
there
that
are
far
richer
in
depth
of
character
than
this
one
i
would
most
likely
pass
on
drinking
this
beer
again
overall
this
beer
is
an
absolute
winner
if
you
can
find
it
pick
it
up
youll
impress
your
friends
on
how
smart
you
are
when
it
comes
to
beer
like
i
said
before
germany
is
1
when
it
comes
to
beer
in
the
world
awesome
i
am
a
fan
for
life
d
went
down
pretty
quickly
and
easily
could
drink
another
but
its
not
calling
my
name
the
sweetness
seemed
to
be
a
little
reminiscent
of
a
cola
to
me
but
otherwise
good
d
nice
malty
roasted
flavor
that
feels
great
in
the
mouth
all
around
really
solid
and
refreshing
has
a
nice
medium
dark
amber
color
with
a
reddish
hue
light
tan
foam
that
disapated
in
a
short
time
the
smell
had
a
roasted
coffee
and
caramel
aroma
with
a
hint
of
fruit
but
the
taste
was
not
really
what
the
aroma
was
there
was
the
roasted
malts
with
a
touch
of
yeast
and
a
hint
of
caramel
this
dunkel
is
not
what
i
expected
in
a
ayinger
beer
just
not
enough
flavor
sort
of
being
boring
no
better
than
average
flavors
were
good
but
seems
a
tad
watery
the
dark
malts
were
comforting
in
a
way
good
nose
rich
aftertastes
of
toffee
and
caramel
d
very
good
probably
the
best
example
of
the
style
available
to
us
in
bottles
this
sample
is
not
the
freshest
but
it
hasnt
gone
as
south
as
some
ive
tried
i
just
dont
think
it
sells
here
in
the
us
too
bad
because
the
style
is
rich
and
satisfying
d
overall
a
tasty
dunkel
and
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
and
have
access
to
it
the
dark
roasted
flavours
provide
for
unique
experience
drinkability
crisp
and
refreshing
very
comforting
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
drank
6
of
these
one
after
another
had
a
bite
to
eat
and
drank
3
more
amazingly
drinkable
and
delicious
taste
is
toffee
nutty
bready
complex
for
a
lager
following
the
purity
law
medium
body
good
carbonation
level
very
drinkable
for
a
dark
flavorful
lager
overall
it
has
a
very
nice
balance
and
is
easy
drinking
a
great
allyearround
kind
of
beer
that
would
be
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
could
even
be
enjoyed
at
cellar
temp
on
a
cold
day
in
january
ayinger
really
makes
consistantly
great
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
all
in
all
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
ever
had
all
the
flavors
work
very
well
and
they
are
neither
over
or
under
stated
aroma
is
malty
with
smooth
bready
notes
as
well
as
some
caramel
the
flavor
seems
less
potent
than
the
nose
suggests
with
a
moderately
bready
malt
flavor
behind
a
light
bodied
smooth
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
despite
its
malty
bread
like
profile
d
great
this
is
a
great
style
as
the
dark
color
and
subsequent
sweetness
might
appeal
to
those
who
are
same
of
the
same
lagers
d
pretty
easily
drinkable
but
not
the
best
among
dunkels
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
correct
to
style
more
drying
than
most
dunkel
lagers
but
still
drinkable
by
the
liter
made
for
pub
drinking
this
is
a
great
example
of
this
style
yet
not
the
best
i
have
had
d
i
like
this
beer
for
the
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
happens
to
be
great
with
popcorn
500
ml
bottle
pours
clear
dark
amber
hue
with
a
lasting
foamy
offwhite
head
toasted
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
medium
creamy
smooth
body
flavors
are
of
grain
toasted
malt
spicy
hops
with
hints
of
toffee
long
dry
spicy
finish
a
proper
accompaniment
for
some
brats
and
sauerkraut
a
simple
dark
lager
that
is
extremely
well
executed
and
very
tasty
drink
it
like
a
munich
helles
with
a
predominate
fruit
sweetness
good
beer
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
flavor
for
as
dark
as
it
is
its
still
crystal
clear
traditional
brown
color
like
the
bottle
it
comes
in
with
a
tint
of
red
the
head
was
a
light
tan
or
off
white
color
that
disappeared
quickly
the
nose
is
a
burnt
tobacco
earthy
and
leathery
with
some
malty
nuttiness
it
was
sweeter
then
i
anticipated
a
surprise
hint
of
bitterness
also
i
get
some
brown
sugar
and
molasses
mixed
in
at
the
end
it
leaves
a
sweetness
on
the
lips
and
tongue
but
there
is
not
a
lot
of
lingering
this
one
surprised
me
good
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
have
yet
to
find
a
german
lager
of
any
kind
that
wasnt
east
to
drink
overall
a
great
example
of
this
style
a
superb
choice
if
you
want
a
beer
that
combines
dark
beer
flavors
with
lagerlike
drinkability
not
a
bad
dunkel
everything
is
well
balanced
and
could
also
be
a
great
session
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
pours
a
deep
mahogany
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
really
clear
body
with
perfect
clarity
aroma
is
caramelized
malts
roasted
peanuts
and
sow
cashew
aromas
flavor
is
spot
on
with
the
aroma
has
a
malty
sweetness
but
a
nice
fresh
bitterness
that
works
well
with
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
like
a
helles
but
has
a
nice
viscosity
to
it
that
makes
it
fuller
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
really
worth
seeking
out
d
crap
ill
have
to
try
a
real
bottle
of
this
when
i
get
back
to
germany
then
ill
rereview
d
very
drinkable
could
easily
put
several
of
these
down
and
not
notice
price
is
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
a
5
for
me
in
drinkablilty
not
a
lot
of
mdls
to
choose
from
in
alberta
but
this
one
will
be
tuff
to
beat
why
anyone
would
drink
modelo
unless
on
vacation
in
mexico
is
beyond
me
no
contesto
d
an
easy
drinker
d
this
is
the
first
brew
ive
tried
from
ayinger
and
im
impressed
full
flavored
good
mouthfeel
nice
aromas
this
beer
has
it
all
and
is
the
best
dark
lager
ive
had
by
far
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
this
throughout
an
evening
on
its
own
and
i
think
it
would
even
be
better
with
a
meal
it
would
probably
get
a
little
filling
after
a
couple
pints
though
d
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
dark
roasted
flavours
a
rich
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
would
purchase
again
as
said
earlier
this
is
my
new
favorite
dunkel
if
im
craving
a
dark
beer
ill
definitely
be
grabbing
this
when
available
im
wishing
i
had
another
bottle
to
try
almost
fullbodied
but
definitely
smooth
and
tasty
o
another
impressive
offering
from
ayinger
great
brewery
d
not
over
bearing
and
low
abv
very
drinkable
while
it
might
be
smooth
and
slightly
rich
this
is
far
from
complex
it
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
just
doesnt
make
it
from
good
to
great
i
would
recommend
it
more
as
an
digestif
rather
than
with
a
meal
or
by
itself
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
chestnut
with
a
moderate
head
that
eases
to
a
swirl
smells
like
liquid
brown
bread
quite
dry
and
firm
with
rounded
grain
and
some
slight
sweetness
on
the
end
nice
bready
flavors
with
notes
of
molasses
and
grain
and
a
drying
finish
beautifully
balanced
and
not
at
all
sweet
smooth
and
full
in
the
mouth
without
being
grainy
a
classic
dunkel
dark
mahogany
in
the
glass
capped
by
a
halfinch
of
head
clarity
and
color
are
great
it
smells
of
sweet
caramelized
malt
and
toasted
raisin
bread
very
nice
palate
opening
lightly
toasty
and
nutty
with
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
body
is
light
and
it
becomes
pleasantly
crisp
and
moderately
bitter
in
the
finish
drying
up
substantially
a
very
good
dunkel
and
i
bet
it
would
be
even
better
on
tap
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
nice
dark
but
mild
german
lager
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
drinkability
very
nice
beer
although
i
cant
attest
to
how
good
it
is
compared
to
other
munich
dark
lagers
as
i
havent
had
any
but
for
my
vote
it
has
a
nice
taste
and
isnt
too
filling
easy
to
come
back
to
this
is
a
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
that
appears
to
be
a
fine
example
of
the
style
md
i
had
not
heard
of
this
beer
prior
to
my
first
visit
to
total
wine
but
have
had
a
few
other
ayinger
offerings
and
have
always
been
pleased
this
one
is
no
different
very
easy
drinking
as
i
said
before
the
germans
know
how
to
do
it
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
is
good
if
you
are
looking
for
something
thats
moderately
filling
because
with
all
of
the
malts
it
feels
like
youre
having
a
slice
of
bread
drinkability
tracking
with
most
of
these
other
characteristics
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
its
flavors
arent
my
favorite
and
its
mouthfeel
doesnt
keep
my
interest
i
wouldnt
shun
one
of
these
if
offered
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
either
pours
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
trace
of
lace
nice
clear
deep
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
malty
nose
flavor
is
caramel
with
a
nice
hop
backbone
clean
finish
3
70
for
a
5000ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
it
isnt
the
best
dunkel
but
it
is
worth
a
try
o
a
standard
bearer
for
dunkels
from
nose
to
finish
hits
all
the
right
notes
a
beautiful
full
flavor
in
a
beer
that
weighs
in
at
just
5
prost
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
row
and
would
only
drink
this
again
seldomly
impressions
tasty
and
goes
down
well
very
flavorful
without
being
so
complex
that
you
have
to
really
think
about
each
taste
just
drink
one
over
a
nice
conversation
and
watch
your
glass
empty
without
effort
perfect
abv
for
sessioning
id
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
pours
a
deep
amber
with
good
clarity
good
finger
of
khaki
head
with
high
retention
and
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
is
quite
worty
or
malt
syrupy
fairly
intense
and
appealing
perhaps
a
some
treacle
in
there
a
bit
husky
taste
has
lots
of
worty
malt
some
toast
not
quite
roasty
but
robustly
malty
with
a
great
malt
finish
that
doesnt
taste
overly
sweet
or
cookielike
like
ive
had
in
a
hundred
beers
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
seems
to
match
its
lagerness
luckily
carbonation
avoids
being
overdone
so
pretty
nice
i
really
like
the
use
of
munich
malts
here
it
gives
it
a
rich
worty
flavor
without
being
sweet
real
nice
beer
from
an
underutilized
style
highly
drinkable
lager
with
a
rich
malt
flavor
d
a
great
example
of
what
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
style
ayinger
has
delivered
a
beer
that
is
both
highly
sessionable
and
incredibly
flavorful
delicious
and
delicate
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
it
is
in
your
area
a
pretty
straightforward
well
crafted
easy
quaffing
munich
dunkel
germans
know
how
to
make
a
tasty
beer
that
is
clean
inoffensive
and
easy
to
throw
down
the
hatch
the
nose
was
a
little
ehh
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
nothing
off
or
odd
about
this
one
i
have
a
slight
cold
and
i
am
still
getting
everything
in
scent
and
flavor
another
terrific
beer
from
ayinger
rich
complex
drinkable
and
delicious
drinkability
i
couldnt
help
but
reach
for
the
glass
with
this
one
as
there
is
so
much
going
on
the
unusual
but
accomplished
flavour
may
not
be
for
everyone
or
for
every
occasion
but
this
is
quite
an
extraordinary
example
of
the
style
i
dunno
this
is
really
good
dont
get
my
wrong
but
its
not
great
maybe
i
just
expected
more
from
the
top
rated
example
of
its
style
on
ba
but
what
does
it
say
about
a
style
when
nine
out
of
the
ten
top
examples
here
dont
rate
any
higher
than
a
b
maybe
im
just
one
of
a
lot
of
bas
who
dont
understand
the
style
enough
to
rate
it
any
higher
i
liked
this
beer
and
cant
think
of
any
reasons
not
to
drink
it
again
so
that
says
something
ayinger
makes
truely
great
beer
nothing
extreme
or
flashy
just
great
d
a
well
made
munich
dunkel
is
always
a
drinkable
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
it
came
in
a
16
oz
true
pint
bottle
but
i
could
see
this
being
served
by
the
liter
very
good
beer
from
a
very
good
brewery
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
nice
off
white
head
on
a
dark
ruby
body
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
maybe
raisins
and
other
dark
pit
fruits
taste
follows
suit
in
a
very
delicious
way
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
not
too
complicated
but
just
plainly
delicious
and
very
expected
considering
the
source
ayinger
d
this
beer
immediately
takes
me
back
to
bavaria
wonderfully
drinkable
overall
i
was
expecting
a
little
less
sweetness
in
this
beer
worth
a
shot
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
but
not
one
to
seek
out
lots
of
carbonation
on
the
palate
overall
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
weak
some
sweetness
a
nice
pleasant
aftertaste
medium
body
high
drinkability
and
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
dunkel
lager
this
one
will
fill
the
need
easy
to
consume
and
a
definite
session
beer
seeing
words
like
muted
lacking
underpowered
and
underplayed
in
a
review
is
never
good
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
theres
absolutely
nothing
here
that
makes
me
want
to
buy
another
and
how
this
is
ranked
ahead
of
far
superior
dunkels
i
do
not
know
d
somewhat
light
in
aroma
and
flavor
but
goes
down
very
easily
the
sweetness
builds
making
more
than
1
bottle
a
bit
much
this
beer
is
one
that
i
would
consider
taking
on
a
deserted
island
with
me
if
i
was
told
i
could
only
drink
one
kind
of
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
whether
or
not
id
choose
it
i
dont
know
but
id
sure
as
hell
consider
it
its
just
solid
nicely
balanced
bold
enough
quenching
enough
malty
historic
tasting
but
also
a
little
citrusy
and
earthy
bravo
to
ayinger
they
do
no
wrong
in
my
eyes
its
a
sticky
brew
not
quite
chewy
theres
weight
behind
this
one
reminds
me
of
a
schwartzbier
these
wheats
are
easy
to
put
away
dunkel
or
wit
damn
fine
beer
cheers
very
happy
to
have
500
ml
of
it
and
i
would
gladly
have
another
outstanding
lager
roasty
clean
and
delicious
dunkel
ayingers
altbairisch
dunkel
pours
a
bright
clear
reddish
brown
the
head
is
creamy
and
pretty
thick
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
toasty
bready
malt
it
smells
like
molasses
on
toast
the
flavor
adds
in
a
spicy
note
but
the
malt
is
really
the
star
hopping
is
light
but
appropriate
for
the
style
just
enough
to
cut
the
malt
sweetness
the
malt
flavor
is
big
and
thick
for
a
lager
ayinger
really
packs
a
lot
of
good
flavor
into
the
5
abv
and
it
comes
out
surprisingly
clean
and
light
this
is
a
very
pleasant
highly
quaffable
beer
another
winner
from
ayinger
good
mouthfeel
with
healthy
carbonation
the
strong
malt
flavour
yet
medium
body
makes
it
easy
to
have
another
the
taste
is
light
whole
wheat
bread
dark
raisins
and
chocolate
up

followed
by
some
mineral
dry
leaves
faint
licorice
its
lightly
sweet
up

transforming
to
a
drier

with
spiciness
and
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
pleasant
light
mineral
toast
and
dry

drinkability
smooth
and
delicious
and
easy
drinking
from
the
500

bottle
with
no

it
pours
a
good
looking
amberbrown
with
excellent
clarity
small
head
and
slow
moving
carbonation
it
looks
heavy
barley
malts
lead
the
appealing
aroma
along
with
something
sweet
like
molasses
the
mouthfeel
is
a
durable
and
smooth
medium
texture
the
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
strong
elements
of
coffee
and
malts
and
a
light
backdrop
of
hops
i
enjoyed
this
one
immensely
dark
brown
and
orange
in
color
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
roasted
flavor
it
smells
and
tastes
a
little
sharp
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
the
drinkability
is
impacted
by
a
so
so
flavor
at
first
i
did
not
like
this
but
it
kind
of
grew
on
me
not
my
style
and
i
will
not
likely
seek
it
out
again
great
bready
chocolate
aftertaste
just
a
classic
and
damn
fine
beer
at
a
good
price
this
one
is
nice
and
fruity
quite
a
good
flavor
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
malty
a
tad
sweet
taste
is
malty
and
refreshing
some
hints
of
fruit
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
a
bit
heavy
on
the
stomach
for
all
night
drinking
overall
this
is
a
quality
brew
d
delicious
seems
like
a
great
beer
to
start
a
day
or
to
drink
on
a
cool
evening
d
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
weird
for
me
not
what
im
used
to
in
a
dunkel
lager
theres
that
weird
corn
and
molasses
flavor
and
the
fruits
are
on
the
light
side
instead
of
the
usual
dark
fruits
overall
a
very
rich
yet
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
good
stuff
this
is
a
solid
beer
very
drinkable
and
balanced
there
is
a
depth
of
flavor
ranging
from
sweet
overtones
in
the
smell
to
a
lingering
coffee
flavor
on
the
palate
in
the
finish
that
gives
this
beer
a
decent
amount
of
character
overall
cant
say
i
loved
this
one
and
it
came
as
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
however
id
like
to
revisit
it
in
the
future
to
see
if
some
of
the
flavors
that
came
through
were
actually
the
result
of
poor
storage
or
heat
exposure
overall
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
but
will
move
on
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
has
crisp
nutty
malts
and
mellow
hops
taste
has
a
decent
malt
profile
and
some
grassy
hops
light
body
has
a
refreshing
carbonation
seems
like
this
could
have
used
a
bit
more
depth
not
quite
on
the
same
level
as
ayingers
other
beers
another
drinkable
german
brew
i
could
have
buckets
of
this
stuff
d
this
beer
really
brings
me
back
to
munich
i
like
this
style
and
i
like
this
particular
offering
i
could
sip
and
savor
this
one
or
i
could
make
quick
work
out
of
a
couplesix
pints
i
should
have
tried
more
of
the
muenchen
dunkel
lagers
when
i
was
in
muenchen
in
2008
because
this
was
excellent
a
nice
lager
good
breadiness
without
being
heavy
at
all
nice
clean
finish
ups
the
drinkability
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
flavor
but
it
works
overall
for
the
style
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
the
definitive
offering
of
the
munich
dunkel
style
notes
this
is
a
very
nice
dark
lager
pour
is
not
black
but
a
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
of
off
white
nose
is
toasted
almond
toffee
and
apple
malty
and
yeast
rather
creamy
with
a
wonderful
toffee
and
apple
pie
texture
very
light
though
goes
down
very
light
a
very
mild
german
bitter
finish
toasty
yeasty
finish
softly
sweet
but
not
a
backbone
of
sweet
just
a
little
bit
of
raisin
really
a
very
mild
sour
leather
that
blends
well
with
the
apple
pie
quality
d
its
a
very
good
brew
especially
following
the
style
it
might
be
a
little
too
sweetmalty
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
17oz
bottles
taste
is
somewhat
watery
malt
slightly
bitter
some
cocoa
roasted
nuts
touch
of
prunes
ends
a
little
dry
and
a
little
sour
d
everything
is
good
with
respect
to
this
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
is
really
special
which
makes
the
whole
experience
rather
nice
relatively
low
in
alcohol
and
it
falls
down
the
throat
very
smoothly
whats
not
to
like
apperance
is
of
a
carmelsienna
hue
not
much
head
or
lace
rows
of
tiny
bubbles
moving
very
fast
to
freedom
has
a
very
pleasent
carmelbarley
aroma
has
a
very
pleasant
barley
coco
coffe
taste
somewhat
mellow
for
a
dark
beer
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
crispyness
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
and
possibly
again
ect
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
bier
that
i
recommend
to
everyone
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
a
bottle
or
tap
of
this
bier
prosit
drink
imbibes
rather
easily
for
a
dunkel
beer
a
nice
dark
german
lager
indeed
a
great
beer
with
more
depth
and
personally
than
your
typical
lager
pours
dark
amber
to
light
brown
with
thin
head
that
doesnt
last
nose
is
surprisingly
tepid
with
some
light
toasty
brown
bread
aromas
palate
is
toasty
a
little
malty
with
some
very
light
caramel
very
thin
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
watery
like
u
s
macros
ah
i
love
tasty
and
well
crafted
lagers
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
dunkel
but
i
found
myself
wanting
more
from
it
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
little
more
rich
and
have
the
malt
be
more
pronounced
i
would
not
hesitate
to
have
this
one
again
but
my
quest
to
find
the
ultimate
munich
dunkel
lager
must
continue
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
its
very
creamy
and
smooth
going
down
quite
drinkable
as
i
usually
find
myself
saying
with
the
ayinger
beers
i
wish
it
was
available
cheaper
and
in
six
packs
all
in
all
this
amounts
to
a
slightly
above
average
dunkel
d
good
session
brew
here
from
ayinger
this
brewery
has
never
failed
to
impress
me
reccommended
drinkability
again
a
style
i
have
not
really
explored
much
of
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
ayinger
altbairisch
dunkel
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
half
liter
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
nutty
the
flavor
is
also
kind
of
nutty
pleasant
enough
but
there
isnt
much
to
it
this
would
be
really
quaffable
if
it
were
cheaper
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
of
this
in
one
sitting
nothing
too
complex
just
a
well
made
quaffable
beer
d
an
enjoyable
tasty
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
slowly
to
enjoy
the
taste
really
wonderful
beer
overall
quite
drinkable
and
overall
a
great
example
of
the
dunkel
style
and
a
nice
quaffer
nice
depth
and
perfect
for
sociable
situations
one
of
my
favorite
beers
considering
that
it
is
affordable
and
you
really
do
get
your
moneys
worth
an
adequate
generally
serviceable
dark
lager
nothing
more
as
at
least
with
the
germans
you
know
theres
a
minimum
threshold
to
quality
and
this
might
be
it
im
not
quite
inspired
to
have
another
go
at
this
one
any
time
soon
very
enjoyable
beer
wish
i
had
more
than
one
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
that
really
doesnt
leave
much
lace
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
nice
complex
malt
flavor
that
transitions
to
a
well
balanced
maltybitter
aftertaste
that
has
a
great
roasted
malt
flavor
medium
bodied
with
a
very
dry
finish
this
is
a
really
good
drinker
that
is
plenty
complex
yet
easy
to
drink
and
goes
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
roast
beef
sandwich
pizza
cheese
and
crackers
conclusion
great
dunkel
lager
rich
fairly
fullbodied
for
its
gravity
and
brimming
with
flavor
chalk
another
win
up
for
ayinger
ayinger
is
already
one
of
my
favorite
european
breweries
and
ayinger
altbairisch
dunkel
is
the
latest
beer
to
back
my
claim
go
get
this
one
d
its
an
okay
german
lager
not
great
but
certainly
not
bad
i
wish
i
had
more
good
to
report
but
then
again
i
have
no
real
bad
to
report
either
mfd
good
nothing
to
complain
about
would
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
on
the
other
hand
i
have
nothing
to
brag
about
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
and
fluffy
threefinger
tan
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
the
smell
is
mostly
slightly
toasted
malt
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
the
tast
starts
off
with
some
big
malt
that
gives
way
to
some
toffee
and
caramel
candy
with
a
bit
of
dried
fruitiness
that
is
cut
slightly
by
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
and
creamy
with
some
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
bottles
at
a
time
the
taste
is
slightly
thin
and
light
bodied
there
is
a
lot
of
caramel
again
the
roasted
sweet
malts
are
paramount
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
hop
presence
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
smooth
fairly
creamy
but
overall
quite
light
bodied
there
is
a
slight
molasses
note
or
two
in
the
taste
and
it
does
finish
with
a
bit
of
a
tart
bite
or
at
least
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
note
or
two
there
is
a
roasted
and
sweet
almost
candied
sweetness
that
lingers
well
into
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
beer
is
decent
for
the
style
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
that
tasted
less
like
a
watered
down
bock
beer
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
brownburgundy
color
dunkel
with
a
nice
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
some
caramel
and
light
molasses
is
enjoyable
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
medium
sweet
malt
with
some
nice
notes
of
caramel
malt
and
some
very
subtle
molasses
and
a
light
dry
roasted
finish
average
body
with
good
carbonation
very
well
done
but
i
am
not
sure
this
is
a
style
that
i
really
dig
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pilsener
glass
rusty
red
color
almost
bordering
on
scarlet
huge
white
head
lots
of
lacing
carbonation
lasted
a
long
time
with
almost
champagnelike
bubbles
working
their
way
up
the
slender
glass
slight
scent
of
clove
perhaps
but
not
much
else
taste
reminded
me
a
bit
of
winter
spices
like
cinnamon
and
coriander
there
was
a
good
backbone
of
malt
to
this
beer
that
gave
it
a
nice
body
its
smoothness
and
low
abv
made
it
very
easy
to
drink
i
was
expecting
a
darker
heavier
beer
but
instead
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
a
reddish
light
refreshing
beer
glad
i
randomly
just
picked
up
a
bottle
a
nice
change
of
pace
highly
attractive
redamber
color
clear
with
a
dispersed
flow
of
miniscule
bubbles
the
head
one
finger
deep
but
stays
at
that
depth
for
some
time
everything
about
the
nose
is
subdued
halfmeasures
coffee
and
heavy
cream
lightly
toasted
malts
raisin
fruit
fruitcake
carob
given
the
lack
of
hoppy
scents
doesnt
require
that
kind
of
counterweight
to
stay
in
balance
lightbodied
here
the
carbonation
does
tend
to
diffuse
the
flavors
prematurely
same
mixture
of
dark
fruits
coffee
cream
butterscotch
at
times
there
is
a
sourness
which
adds
spark
needs
a
bookmark
loses
its
place
by
the
midpalate
smooth
with
nary
a
rough
edge
in
sight
err
taste
but
theres
this
nagging
sense
that
something
is
missing
you
just
keep
waiting
for
an
extra
gear
d
this
reminds
me
of
an
english
bitter
its
ok
i
expected
much
more
from
this
because
the
celebrator
and
centennial
lager
from
the
same
brewery
were
incredible
it
came
down
between
this
and
weihenstephaner
dunkelweizen
at
kappys
in
saugus
today
but
since
i
rarely
have
this
style
i
decided
it
would
be
a
nice
change
color
is
dark
copper
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
dark
bread
and
banana
come
to
mind
first
when
smelling
followed
by
some
clove
and
bit
of
powdered
chocolate
taste
is
big
on
the
dark
bread
factor
which
gives
it
a
sweet
start
but
then
it
becomes
a
bit
sharper
tasting
with
dry
grains
and
a
hop
bite
those
last
impressions
taste
wise
really
distinguish
it
from
the
dark
german
weiss
beers
i
am
used
to
mouthfeel
is
light
and
beautifully
carbonated
this
quenches
my
thirst
as
well
as
any
light
ale
or
lager
drinking
this
one
is
about
as
easy
as
it
gets
this
was
a
great
beer
to
kick
off
a
christmas
eve
which
i
am
sure
is
going
to
be
filled
with
other
great
offerings
from
a
0
5
l
bottle
purchased
locally
aroma
is
full
of
malt
and
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
color
is
a
deep
rust
amber
with
a
beige
head
smooth
malt
with
some
melanoidin
character
i
taste
a
little
bit
of
cardboard
from
probably
being
on
the
shelf
too
long
a
little
sweetness
but
balanced
nicely
with
a
dry
finish
this
one
is
good
but
i
wish
i
could
have
a
better
bottle
because
i
know
this
beer
could
be
fantastic

brown

with

that
left
lace
as
it
died
mild

smell
of

and
some
roasted
and
coffee
malts
a
dry
crisp
sensation
when
the
beer
first
hit
my
tongue
followed
by
a
sweet
malt
taste
of
caramel
and
hints
of
coffee
in
a
mediumboided
beer
that
is
a

syrupy
but
goes
down

smooth
with
some
creaminess
tastes
great
with
a
little

or
roasted

dryness
on
the

there
werent
any

that
i
tasted
a

to
kick
around
with
d
highly
drinkable
something
ayinger
does
makes
every

ive
had
by
them
really
good

with
an

good
beer
to
enjoy
over
again
excellent
beer
i
wish
this
came
in
6
packs
for
a
moderate
price
taste
to
me
is
excellent
initially
kind
of
interesting
and
salty
soysaucelike
but
that
dies
down
a
bit
nice
roasted

sweet

flavor
good
tartness
and
mild
hop
flavor
like
a
good
dunkel
or
schwarz
great
mouthfeel
medium

smooth
and
buttery
moderate
carbonation
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
not
too
heavy
or
strong
at
all
as
with
most
ayinger
brews
this
one
is
definitely
solid
full
flavor
excellent
aroma
and
a
highly
drinkable
brew
this
one
is
void
of
anything
even
close
to
offensive
and
is
just
a
flat
out
exceptional
example
of
a
munich
lager
d
it
was
a
refreshing
well
balanced
and
tasty
brew
with
a
light

it

very
nice
rich
and
complex
yet
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
want
another
i
like
this
on
an
unseasonably
warm
fall
day
drinks
easily
and
not
as
filling
as
some
darker
german
offerings
once
again
ayinger
doesnt
disappoint
d
this
is
an
excellent
munich
dunkel
so
much
complexity
of
flavours
and
so
well
balanced
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
ayinger
once
again
has
proven
that
they
are
one
of
germanys
top
brewers
d
highly
sessionable
one
of
the
best
tasting
lower
abv
beers
ive
tried
d
a
great
beer
for
sure
as
are
all
ayinger
products
ive
come
in
contact
with
very
low
bitterness
smooth
body
without
the
heaviness
and
an
immensely
flavorful
brew
put
this
on
the
edge
of
perfection
a
nice
brew
that
i
will
not
shy
away
from
in
the
future
overall
this
dark
lager
is
delicious
refreshing
and
probably
chuggable
ill
be
buying
more
of
these
in
the
future
for
sure
disappointing
i
have
no
idea
how
fresh
this
sample
is
no
bottling
code
or
best
before
date
this
is
a
rather
forgettable
beer
it
just
doesnt
have
alot
of
character
i
have
brewed
and
tasted
others
homebrewed
dark
lagers
that
are
much
better
than
this
ill
stick
with
their
doppelbock
poured
to
a
two
fingered
head
that
had
a
lot
of
small
bubbles
halfway
into
the
glass
the
head
disappeared
but
left
some
foam
around
the
edges
lager
was
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
caramelish
head
had
some
lacing
but
not
a
lot
smelled
sweet
with
hints
of
malt
tasted
of
sweet
malt
and
had
a
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
aftertaste
hung
around
awhile
overall
not
a
lot
of
taste
going
on
here
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
about
right
for
my
taste
i
think
i
had
my
hopes
up
to
try
this
beer
i
would
drink
these
again
but
its
just
not
a
priority
i
will
try
other
ayinger
brews
to
get
a
better
feel
about
the
quality
of
their
beer
overall
nah
d
good
per
style
light
and
easy
enough
to
drink
and
good
for
putting
down
a
few
drinkability
on
this
one
is
high
there
really
just
isnt
anything
about
this
beer
that
would
make
it
difficult
to
drink
one
after
another
very
good
i
would
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
that
i
knew
was
very
fresh
heres
to
hoping
the
sweetness
fads
when
the
well
balanced
hops
kick
in
for
a
most
lip
smacking
finish
at
2
75
for
a
generous
pint
this
is
a
drinker
for
any
season
5
almost
gets
this
into
session
status
drinkability
medium
bodied
crisp
and
clean
refeshing
and
tasty
dark
lager
d
very
nice
d
for
this
complex
lager
the
fruitiness
makes
me
think
ale
but
the
sheer
crispness
gives
away
the
truth
overall
a
very
nice
lager
flavorful
aromatic
and
refreshing
is
well
appreciated
during
this
early
june
heat
wave
the
alt
phrase
on
the
bottle
illudes
to
this
being
and
altbier
though
the
beer
does
hit
on
the
light
caramel
toast
flavors
this
beer
takes
the
proportions
of
these
to
the
dunkel
level
quite
toasty
malty
bready
but
also
with
lowlying
levels
of
sweetness
dryness
and
light
fruitiness
moderately
full
in
texture
with
much
creaminess
but
not
heavy
toasty
dry
and
cleanly
finished
a
highly
drinkable
beer
for
the
big
flavors
if
your
in
or
around
cumberlandmd
stop
by
south
cumberland
liquors
and
try
this
great
brew
overall
this
is
a
clean
flavored
lager
with
a
decent
malty
sweetness
to
it
i
didnt
find
it
too
exciting
so
i
wouldnt
have
many
but
you
certainly
could
if
this
was
your
kind
of
brew
i
give
them
credit
for
making
a
nice
sessionable
beer
d
good
after
dinner
beer
but
id
say
two
bottle
limit
for
me
overall
this
was
a
pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
brew
from
the
good
folks
in
aying
in
the
end
its
just
short
of
sessionable
almost
people
this
beer
is
drinkable
pretty
good
but
not
great
d
i
could
put
down
a
bunch
of
these
since
the
beer
is
pretty
mild
and
smooth
m
d
a
round
body
a
rich
coating
and
very
smooth
it
ends
up
being
very
nice
to
drink
quite
tasty
leaving
a
lingering
toasted
malt
flavour
in
the
mouth
a
nice
dark
lager
that
never
disappoints
recommended
ok
as
for
the
beer
itself
it
is
a
very
nice
looking
clear
brown
which
shows
itself
to
be
a
very
deep
garnet
red
when
held
to
the
light
a
nice
light
tan
heads
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
nice
with
lots
of
sweet
roasted
malt
caramel
nut
and
a
bit
of
coffe
in
there
also
some
fruit
the
taste
is
very
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
coffee
and
roast
the
hops
seem
like
they
might
make
a
very
brief
bitter
appearance
but
not
much
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
under
medium
with
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
sweet
malty
brew
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
but
just
not
my
taste
smooth
on
the
palate
with
good
carbonation
you
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
d
a
good
beer
but
tastes
much
like
a
marzen
not
pleased
with
the
taste
of
marzen
the
aroma
was
lemony
and
malty
with
a
faint
caramel
the
flavor
was
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
nice
bitterness
that
stayed
with
you
in
the
mouth
it
was
semichewy
overall
a
very
good
drink
a
little
watery
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
this
may
be
the
highest
ranking
i
have
given
any
lager
light
or
dark
i
drank
this
rather
cool
from
a
500
ml
bottle
ayinger
is
possibly
overall
my
favorite
german
brewery
the
body
was
like
most
german
beers
that
is
to
say
it
was
lightmedium
very
drinkable
d
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
very
crisp
and
clean
sort
of
refeshing
and
a
nice
and
tasty
dark
larger
overall
this
is
a
german
beer
version
of
comfort
food
its
just
what
i
imagine
drinking
in
a
homey
boisterous
brauhaus
complete
with
a
voluptuous
umm
well
never
mind
that
anyway
its
an
effortlessly
sessionable
basic
good
beer
its
dangerous
in
the
smooth
way
it
goes
down
this
one
will
always
be
good
for
a
contented
smile
whether
in
a
bavarian
biergarten
or
in
my
family
room
im
easy
that
way
goes
down
easy
but
the
sweetness
might
get
to
be
too
much
after
a
few
i
would
enjoy
those
few
though
good
beer
verdict
an
decent
version
of
a
dunkel
dark
smooth
and
dry
very
drinkable
as
well
sessionable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
another
strong
offering
from
ayinger
the
brewerys
brau
weisse
offering
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
brews
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
especially
after
loving
their
oktoberfestmarzen
pours
an
impressive
darkpurple
hue
with
a
frothy
head
that
left
some
lacing
flavorful
distinct
aroma
with
toffee
prunes
and
figs
taste
strongly
complements
the
smell
with
darkfruit
malts
caramel
and
some
brown
sugar
light
refreshing
flavor
that
is
very
distinct
and
different
from
many
other
styles
ive
sampled
good
stuff
easily
drinkable
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
full
of
intriguing
subtle
flavors
as
im
drinking
this
im
certainly
starting
to
notice
a
grapejuice
like
flavor
very
different
type
of
taste
that
i
havent
otherwise
come
across
copped
a
single
500
ml
bottle
from
garys
in
madison
for
2
75
worth
it
all
of
ayingers
brews
are
topclass
and
this
one
certaily
fits
the
bill
with
allaround
quality
taste
and
character
definitely
recommended
a
very
well
made
dunkel
is
my
desert
island
beer
i
simply
enjoy
everything
about
them
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
over
the

drinkability
no
one
thing
stands
out
as
being
superb
but
this
beer
is
put
together
very
well
the
whole
is
definitely
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
i
found
this
easily
drinkable
due
to
the
good
taste
and
easy
mouthfeel
not
too
heavy
so
itd
be
a
very
nice
beer
for
a
long
night
very
balanced
no
extremes
in
any
category
the
longer
it
sits
on
the
tongue
the
more
flavors
you
can
pick
out
could
possibly
stand
a
touch
more
carbonation
to
make
it
spicier
as
it
stands
it
is
light
bodied
but
lacks
the
carbonation
support
to
keep
it
from
being
a
little
watery
other
than
that
it
is
an
ideal
smooth
rich
dunkel
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
on
draught
at
the
winking
lizard
glass
special
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
burgundy
color
with
a
medium
thick
light
beige
head
that
diminishes
steadily
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
roasted
malt
nuts
and
dark
chocolate
aroma
mediumbodied
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
toffee
and
dark
fruits
with
touches
of
chocolate
and
hops
the
finish
is
bready
malt
with
a
nice
lingering
roastiness
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
as
are
the
other
ayinger
beers
i
have
tried
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
its
very
drinkable
wish
there
were
more
dunkels
like
this
one
good
drinkability
clean
and
simple
in
the
good
way
the
more
beer
that
i
drink
the
more
i
appreciate
beers
like
this
clean
simple
well
crafted
traditional
styles
d
this
is
great
a
nice
change
from
a
brown
ale
the
malts
are
obviously
very
different
from
england
the
wife
likes
it
a
lot
and
so
do
i
highly
recommended
tasty
beer
that
im
sure
ill
have
again
and
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
no
other
part
of
the
experience
lives
up
to
the
spectacular
appearance
but
several
aspects
are
close
the
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
pilsner
glass
showed
a
clear
redorange
color
with
little
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
had
evidence
of
sweet
cyrstal
barley
with
a
slight
roasted
quality
there
was
subtle
evidence
of
bavarian
yeast
ester
with
a
slight
banana
undertone
there
was
no
hop
aroma
present
the
flavor
initially
has
a
toasted
grain
quality
with
a
dry
breadiness
hop
bitterness
is
ever
so
slight
along
with
a
slight
banana
flavor
the
beer
ends
up
finishing
on
the
sweet
side
due
to
clean
lagering
and
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
all
things
considered
i
found
this
to
be
a
really
good
beer
what
i
enjoyed
the
most
about
it
was
its
finish
it
left
you
with
a
slight
sweet
linger
that
just
invites
the
consumer
to
drink
more
i
will
purcahse
this
bottle
again
this
is
a
really
nice
dark
lager
its
made
in
the
old
style
not
that
you
wouldnt
want
to
savor
it
this
is
the
best
altbairish
dunkel
ive
had
to
date
and
ill
update
this
post
when
that
changes

its

could
have

some
nice

had
considering
the

a

was
good
the
beer
was
gone
fairly
quickly
and
id
have
another
overall

not
special

notable

if
youre
in

mood
you
could
do

good

and
i
really
would
love
to
drink
some
more
at
any
time
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
but
i
think
it
wasnt
as
fresh
as
id
liked
it
to
be
hence
the
skunk
smell
great
flavor
and
drinkability
though
it
wasnt
what
i
thought
at

regardless
i
like
this

from
the

marked

it
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
brown
with
a
huge
foamy
beige
head
that
slowly
diminishes
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
outrageously
sweet
and
malty
and
has
this
german
nutty
characteristic
the
body
is
right
around
medium
i
was
hoping
for
something
bolder
the
taste
is
vibrant
with
malty
sweetness
and
a
mellow
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
newcastle
brown
ale
with
a
slightly
more
bitter
note
it
is
a
likable
beer
and
one
that
i
could
drink
often
lightbodied
but
not
watery
mediumlow
carbonation
just
a
touch
of
creaminess
extremely
drinkable
theres
something
distinctly
different
about
the
malt
in
this
beer
thats
giving
me
fits
as
i
try
to
describe
it
nevertheless
i
would
recommend
this
one
readily
as
a
sessionable
nonbloating
lighter
beer
that
has
the
added
attraction
to
some
of
being
organically
produced
overall
it
is
excellent
very
well
done
very
sessionable
would
be

have

this

said

wasnt

itself

first
bad
beer
ive
had
from

probably
one

your

pilsner
with
tasty
darker
maltiness
displaying

exceptional

light
enough
in
abv

body
to
session
while
offering

clean
and
well
balanced
i
cant
imagine
how
you
coud
improve
on
a
dunkel
d
its
a
pretty
solid
but
ultimately
unremarkable
munich
dunkel
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
id
have
it
again
if
i
were
at
a
german
beer
garden
or
restaurant
d
its
okay
low
drinkability
for
the
abv
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
honestly
for
a
beer
style
that
has
less
wiggle
room
than
others
this
one
is
not
only
a
benchmark
beer
for
the
style
but
a
stellar
example
as
well
so
clean
and
flavorful
each
sip
makes
you
want
another

theres
nothing
to

drinkability
far
too
malty
without
any
hop
balance
underattenuated
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
i
think
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
i
probably
wont
pick
it
up
again
drinkability
pqr
ratio
is
very
decent
but
i
cant
help
but
think
this
should
be
a
lighter
drink
the
chocolate
and
sweetness
makes
it
cloying
and
the
low
carbonation
doesnt
help
aswell
could
use
more
roastiness
and
other
types
of
dark
flavors
to
balance
the
chocolate
taste
give
it
more
depth
and
make
it
less
heavy
drinkability
skip
it
for
me
this
one
just
comes
across
as
entirely
too
thin
in
all
of
its
attributes
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a

ill
do
myself
a
favor
and
have
an

truly

i
wonder
what
a
keg
of
this
costs
and
if
my
customer

at
work
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
it
by
the
pint
pours
a
dark
brown
that
is
nearly
clear

is
thick
and
sweet
cloying
malts
flavor
is
malty
sweet
as
well
cloying
yes
smooth
fairly
some
fruit
tones
but
mostly
what
i
notice
is
an
odd
burn
on
the
flavor
profile
seems
almost
alcoholic
but
isnt
really
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
lower
on
carbonation
this
is
okay
i
suppose
too
cloying
though
and
i
wouldnt
go
for
it
again
as
for
being
dedicated

you

one
of

really
nice

overall
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a

after

this
is
a

wellrounded
dark
lager
that
is

at

for
a

of

500ml
o
unusual
lager
but
in
the
positive
way
very
good
bottle
fairly
fullbodied
with
small
hints
of
roasted
malt
a
little
thin
but
pretty
good
way
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
a
very
good
light
dark
beer
great
from
the
can
the
beer
mirrored
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
czech
beers
of

highly
drinkable
enjoyable
with
little

no

and
very
easy

its
a

easy
to

quite
unimpressed
close
to
the
worst
czech
beer
i
got
from
prague
not
sur
eif
this
was
a
bad
batch
or
just
a
poor
overall
beer
but
the
reviews
seem
to
be
better
than
this
not
sure
remarks
did
not
score
a

m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
decent
beer
but
comes
up
a

short
for
a
czech

o
the
nice
crisp
clean
bock
turns
a
bit
mineral

and
a
bit
sulfury
as
it
opens
up
the
fizz
grows
and
scrubs
a
lot
of
the
malt
flavors
away
pours
a

leaves

not

at

for

youll
notice

this

the
only
thing
that
is

with
this
beer
is
that
i
cant
find
it
back
to
canada
québec
all
in
all
a
nice
example
of
a
dark
czech
beer
with
some
complexity
and
none
of
the
heaviness
of
an
english
porter
or
stout
d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
because
it
almost
goes
down
like
water
d
the
lactic
taste
seems
to
be
very
common
among
the
beers
ive
had
here
in
russia
either
this
is
a
taste
design
choice
or
more
likely
every
tap
in
the
city
hasnt
been
cleaned
for
ages
the
locals
must
like
it
though
because
every
place
has
a
similar
flavor
d
for
a
dark
beer
quite
decent
this
was
a
bottle
a
friend
just
brought
back
to
the
us
he
told
me
it
was
a
dopplebock
when
i
saw
the
goat
i
thought
i
was
in
business
one
sip
and
i
know
it
was
of
lower
gravity
nice
and
mellow
but
not
really
that
interesting
d
workable
dark
lager
would
get
bored
with
this
after
one
or
2
of
these
mostly
sweet
and
refreshing
i
would
not
let
this
get
too
warm
decent
warm
up
beer
for
the
night
but
not
real
memorable
low
abv
and
easy
to
drink
just
not
that
complex
definitely
a
lager
but
with
lots
of
malt
character
could
cloy
over
time
but
definitely
a
tasty
sipper
for
one
or
two
lacks
body
and
substance
in
its
bottle
form
drank
from
a
tap
in
prague
i
thought
it
sweet
but
it
had
more
depth
of
body
and
character
disappointed
with
the
wishywashy
bottled
version
and
it
is
my
last
beer
from
prague
that
i
obtained
to
review
wish
id
kept
something
else
back
now
this
is
drinkable
mainly
due
to
its
lack
of
real
flavour
rather
than
being
particularly
special
an
easy
quaffer
feel
is
quite
sticky
with
a
slight
sharpness
at
the
back
i
wouldnt
call
it
thin
because
for
a
3
5
beer
it
isnt
but
its
definitely
a
bit
flat
i
really
could
have
loved
this
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
push
the
right
buttons
some
more
spicy
czech
hops
would
have
gone
down
a
treat
or
a
mans
treat
anyway
because
currently
it
tastes
more
like
a
young
boys
treat
dark
rich
brown
color
slight
head
light
brown
in
color
quite
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
maybe
even
a
little
coffee
or
something
sweet
malty
flavor
unfortunately
tonight
is
my
last
night
in
prague
so
i
probably
wont
get
to
try
one
of
these
again
for
a
while
perhaps
ill
have
one
tomorrow
morning
before
my
flight
that
sounds
like
a
great
idea
had
this
at
a
very
good
beer
pub
in
the
czech
republic
good
dark
beer
that
was
more
like
a
schwarzbeer
than
a
dark
lager
light
in
mouthfeel
but
with
a
great
dark
malt
aftertaste
could
have
had
three
or
four
more
if
it
wasnt
early
afternoon
would
recommend
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
tan
head
it
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
and
clear
i
can
smell
the
sweet
chocolate
immediately
it
tastes
sweet
and
of
chocolate
as
well
i
am
very
impressed
i
was
not
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
but
it
is
quite
tasty
it
is
easy
drinking
this
is
way
better
than
pilsner
urquell
too
bad
she
didnt
bring
some
more
back
d
good
not
heavy
enjoyable
and
flavourful
you
can
either
sip
it
or
guzzle
it
either
way
its
good
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
there
is
some
complexity
in
the
feel
that
is
of
kicking
carbonation
but
finishes
into
a
mellow
smooth
and
almost
creamy
beer
at
3
8
abv
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
sessionable
beer
i
wish
i
had
known
about
this
beer
when
i
was
in
prague
in
2002
as
nice
as
it
is
in
the
bottle
i
would
like
to
have
had
it
on
tap
some
smart
importer
ought
to
try
and
get
this
beer
into
the
states
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
really
love
this
beer
it
has
a
very
rich
taste
anyway
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
d
decent
enough
but
id
have
a
different
beer
rathe
than
another
of
this
im
drinking
it
with
whittakers
dark
ghanaian
chocolate
and
if
i
die
right
now
it
would
be
in
a
state
of
grace
d
unreal
i
could
have
kept
drinking
this
except
i
only
had
a
pint
under
4au
too
great
bargain
beautifully
balanced
munich
dunkel
lager
although
reminded
me
more
of
an
ale
now
i
buy
it
in
the
bottle
its
one
of
my
favorites
on
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
in
this
stylemunich
dunkel
beer
although
its
not
too
sophisticated
the
taste
and
aroma
are
rich
my
favorite
beer
when
i
lived
in
prague
it
wasnt
as
common
to
find
as
others
but
i
found
myself
going
to
the
same
bars
because
i
knew
they
served
kozel
dark
dark
brown
in
color
and
poyrs
a
great
head
vert
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
no
negative
aftertaste
and
i
wish
it
was
here
in
the
us
exceptionally
drinkable
especially
in
prague
where
it
is
dirt
cheap

between
stockholm
and
helsinki
from

goes

one
of
my
top
3
beers
while
in
eastern
europe

d
i
could
use
a
little
more
bitterness
but
those
who
love
a
malty
lighter
lager
should
be
into
it
i
have
only
seen
it
in
the
czech
republic
not
complex
or
overly
interesting
but
a
good
change
of
pace
when
in
the
land
of
pilsener
i
had
a
half
litre
of
this
on
tap
in
the
czech
inn
dublin

on
5th

brew
with

maybe
some

but
very
dark
so
hard
to
see
malty
aroma
tasted
well
a
nottoo
complex
mix
of
maltiness
and
sweetness
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
nice
beer
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
and
have
not
had
alot
of
this
style
before
so
i
would
like
to
try
more
now
i
would
definitely
try
some
if
i
saw
it
here
in
ireland
or
if
i
go
back
to
praha
d
a
nice
break
from
bohemian
lager
some
nice
flavours
would
have
again
overall
its
not
bad
at
all
much
better
than
i
had
expected
d
easy
drinking
but
more
like
a
malt
shake
than
a
beer
the
wheat
and
the
cerne
dark
ar
pivovarsky
dum
great
little
brewery
that
doesnt
distribute
so
you
have
to
go
there
to
try
it
u
fleku
was
an
interesting
experience
too
their
dark
beer
is
good
not
exciting
but
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
taste
is
good
drank
it
warmer
than
i
prefer
coffee
some
chocolate
yeast
and
roasted
yet
was
lighter
than
it
looked
still
easy
drinking
though
never
tried
the
bottled
version
but
ontap
its
great
very
drinkable
a

despite

including

tad
chocolate

as
well
bit

not

easy
drink
a
particular
dunkel
style
ok
but
not
that
i
seek
out
pure
heaven
compared
to
the
bottled
version
you
can
find
in
sweden
pours
a
clear
cola
brown
under
a
two
finger
beige
head
with
decent
body
and
retention
leaving
a
few
lace
strands
the
nose
is
very
mild
just
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
not
the
expected
caramel
slightly
viscous
mouth
with
medium
carbonation
the
taste
is
mild
all
around
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
as
the
primary
flavor
essentially
no
hops
to
break
it
up
so
the
caramel
lasts
well
into
the
aftertaste
its
drinkable
enough
but
also
pretty
ho
hum
its
low
carbonation
and
its
integrated
flavours
make
this
a
great
beer
and
begs
to
be
drunk
in
quantity
d
overall
its
a
very
easydrinking
dark
beer
although
i
forgot
its
special
characters
if
any
almost
as
soon
as
a
pint
was
dried
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
one
average
in
about
all
respects
although
i
did
like
its
appearance
nice
deep
red
color
to
it
otherwise
very
simple
beer
lots
of
sweet
carmel
this
stuff
is
really
sweet
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
hits
at
the
end
but
its
barely
noticeable
in
all
its
an
enjoyable
brew
but
theres
lots
of
much
much
better
ones
to
be
had
notes
ive
always
liked
this
beer
and
its
best
quality
is
the
way
it
keeps
after
travelling
this
tastes
the
same
out
of
the
bottle
in
australia
as
in
a
bratislava
bierkeller
my
favourite
beer
of
the
style
and
most
similar
styles
this
is
another
winner
from
the
czech
republic
value
for
money
gives
this
5
stars
3
for
500
ml
when
the
local
aussie
swill
is
2
15
for
375
ml
would
be
nice
to
see
a
more
robust
version
of
this
served
a
deep
dark
almost
black
with
a
hint
of
red
color
and
a
big
tan
headskie
which
was
gone
before
i
got
a
chance
to
blink
or
take
a
sip
thin
and
lacking
helpful
mouthfeel
this
one
has
that
flavor
which
i
like
to
avoid
in
beers
so
i
will
avoid
this
beer
in
the
future
very
average
and
not
worth
seeking
out
produced
from
special
dark
malts
which
is
why
the
foam
is
even
dark
it
is
very
sweet
and
light
in
body
low
alcohol
and
light
cabronation
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
the
lighttomedium
malt
body
with
caramel
malt
flavors
only
add
to
the
delicousness
of
this
brew
its
only
weaknesses
are
that
the
aroma
isnt
remarkable
how
could
it
be
when
the
taste
is
so
mild
and
the
head
retention
is
somewhat
poor
tastee
i
personally
feel
that
this
particular
beer
is
overrated
the
colour
is
nice
aroma
is
somewhat
grainy
almost
full
bodied
with
a
disappointing
taste
tad
heavy
on
the
hops
with
some
lingering
after
taste
the
packaging
was
impressive
tho
ok
i
only
ever
sampled
this
once
and
yes
i
will
resample
again
given
the
hight
ratings
given
so
far
mine
was
sweet
with
a
raisiny
chocolate
flavour
short
finish
and
quite
a
syruppy
texture
im
starting
to
think
my
bottle
may
not
have
been
as
fresh
as
it
could
have
been
very
deep
and
rich
amber
appearance
light
tan
head
with
some
stickinessbelgian

wonderful

smell
unbelievable
dark
rich
taste
this
beer
tastes
very
much
like
cocoa
i
can
not
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
as
one
bottle
would
take
the
place
of
a
whole
german
chocolate
cake
and
a
cup
of
sweetened
espresso
one
of
my
favorite
czech
beers
richly
dark
and
chocolate
in
flavor
im
not
sure
if
you
can
get
this
in
the
states
but
if
you
can
i
highly
recommend
it
a
great
everyday
beer

o
this
beer
is
like
a
chocolate
bar
at
the
check
out
line
very
affordable
and
very
tasty
with
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
definitely
will
drink
again
very
well
rounded
for
its
style
bland
reminds
me
of
yuengling
im
biased
as
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
wonderful
dunkel
ogood
beer
this
is
by
far
best
dunkel
on
draft
lucky
for
me
the
brewery
is
10
min
from
house
the
bottle
is
good
but
if
you
can
get
on
draft
i
highly
recommend
amazingly
awesome
this
is
a
hell
of
a
dunkel
im
not
familiar
with
this
type
of
beer
and
to
me
it
tasted
a
lot
like
wine
for
some
reason
nice
head
with
decent
lacing
beautiful
color
dark
bronze
not
to
sweet
but
smell
and
taste
molasses
nice
consistent
taste
throughout
really
nice
beer
best
dunkel
i
have
had
honestly
questioning
myself
on
why
i
dont
give
it
a
5
this
beer
is
the
only
reason
i
go
to
their
restaurant
dont
recommend
this
beer
on
the
golf
course
or
after
playing
softball
but
thats
about
it
overall
i
like
the
style
a
lot
and
wish
i
could
try
this
on
draft
the
two
dunkels
i
have
had
in
bottles
havent
been
as
great
as
the
one
i
had
on
draft
but
cant
find
dunkels
on
tap
in
my
area
cheers
not
much

medium

a
bit
of

taste
is
slightly
sweet
smooth
thin
to
medium
body
o
a
little
one
note
this
is
my
favorite
beer
i
cannot
give
this
one
as
thorough
a
review
because
i
was
drinking
it
at
a
tavern
with
colleagues
after
work
as
a
result
it
would
have
been
antisocial
and
beer
geeky
of
me
to
leave
the
conversation
to
carefully
analyze
the
elements
of
the
beer
that
said
i
find
this
to
be
a
high
quality
beer
i
had
it
in
a
stein
i
loved
the
brown
color
and
enjoyed
the
malty
sweet
aroma
highly
drinkable
refreshing
and
a
good
beer
to
unwind
with
work
friends
on
a
friday
afternoon
if
you
love
a
malty
beer
youll
like
this
one
it
felt
a
bit
filling
too
clear
mediumdark
amber
color
nice
balance
of
hops
with
a
slightly
malty
finish
yeah
the
germans
know
what
theyre
doing
this
one
is
really
good
overall
3

its
a
tasty
brew
similar
to
a
pale
wheat
ale
its
got
the
hops
and
cilantro
thing
going
on
which
pushes
it
into
american
pale
ale
territory
but
it
also
has
an
uncanny
maltiness
that
apas
typically
do
not
have
its
not
my
type
of
beer
but
its
drinkable
and
im
glad
i
at
least
got
to
try
it
wont
be
buying
it
again
but
i
can
respect
it
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
severely
under
appreciated
i
luv
it

no

long

taste
harkens
the
days
when
all
the
euro
brews
were

versions
difference
is
this
shows
what
they
were
trying
for
good
beer
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
well
worth
a
try
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
draft
at
my
nearest
hofbrauhaus
in
cincinatti
nice
flavor
rich
taste
the
king
of
beer
very
smooth
and
delicious
aftertaste
that
sticks
with
you
really
good
beer
pours
a
fiery
copper
orange
this
beer
is
aglow
with
light
and
with
radiance
a
fat
tan
head
of
foam
fell
well
and
left
a
ring
and
some
spots
of
lace
to
look
at
inside
the
glass
it
is
as
serene
as
a
perfect
pane
of
colored
glass
the
nose
is
breaddy
dark
crusty
bread
that
is
lightly
toasted
there
is
a
baked
grain
sweetness
on
this
plus
a
sweetness
from
caramel
no
fruity
esters
no
hops
wonderfully
clean
taste
is
tantalizing
and
smooth
all
that
malt
but
no
heaviness
the
body
is
thin
and
the
lighter
side
of
medium
the
malt
is
crisp
a
brief
hint
of
chocolate
comes
out
as
it
warms
but
remains
largely
and
delightfully
unfullfilled
it
envelops
the
palate
just
as
its
light
sweetness
comes
up
to
rescue
you
the
finish
on
this
one
is
malty
breaddy
and
dry
with
a
light
touch
of
bitterness
from
subtle
hops
perfect
overall
very
disappointed
by
this
loved
the
other
hofbrau
offerings
ive
had
this
just
has
none
of
the
characteristics
i
look
for
in
a
dunkel
ill
stick
with
the
original
and
hefe
overall
a
pretty
simple
beer
there
are
other
dunkels
i
would
probably
reach
for
first
but
this
one
is
nice
for
the
price
definitely
a
style
that
i
need
a
bit
more
familiarity
with
a
solid
dunkel
overall
this
is
a
new
style
for
us
and
weve
been
very
excited
for
this
foray
for
whatever
reason
of
all
the
styles
were
currently
missing
on
ba
this
was
towards
the
top
of
our
list
as
lovers
of
münich
style
lagers
this
one
certainly
does
the
region
and
the
country
justice
the
beer
remains
light
enough
in
feel
much
in
the
same
way
the
helles
lagers
do
to
keep
the
beer
from
becoming
overpowering
or
overbearing
the
flavoring
is
robust
but
packaged
in
such
a
simply
and
decidedly
light
fashion
it
works
very
well
o
great
traditional
german
brew
wonderful
from
the
tap
at
the
hofbräus
house
but
great
from
the
bottle
as
well
refreshing
wether
on
the
beach
or
inside
on
a
winters
night
o
good
to
have
a
nice
fresh
version
of
the
german
standard
although
served
too
cold
overall
this
a
great
easy
drinking
dunkel
maybe
a
touch
more
flavor
could
boost
its

out
another
one
i
have
too

exporing
to
do
in
this
style
to
revisit
this
one
12oz
pint
glass
this
is
a
classic
german
dunkel
taste
is
wonderful
when
had
fresh
at
the
hofbrauhaus
th
beer
is
an
attractive
dark
amber
that
drinks
much
lighter
than
you
would
think
based
on
appearance
very
good
every
day
4
season
beer
good
in
a
bottle
but
really
good
in
a
stein
from
a
keg
o
i
think
it
is
good
example
of
the
style
its
not
overly
complex
or
unique
in
its
flavors
but
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
its
a
nice
dark
lager
that
suits
any
time
of
year
overall
i
like
this
brew
for
me
its
close
to
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
more
than
one
but
the
sweetness
would
leave
me
looking
for
a
lawnmower
beer
or
esb
this
is
indeed
another
beer
that
reinforces
my
love
of
the
dunkel
style
another
well
done
beer
from
hofbrau
overall
this
is
a
great
german
dunkel
and
really
can
you
expect
any
less
from
a
munich
beer
nice
and
malty
and
extremely
drinkable
i
love
it
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
huge
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
toffee
light
caramel
and
caramelized
sugars
with
hints
of
dark
dried
fruits
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malt
with
lots
of
burnt
darker
sugars
light
bits
of
prunes
and
raisins
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
dark
lager
very
well
done
overall
really
flavorful
and
a
nice
brew
to
have
on
an
october
evening
the
taste
is
generally
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
full
malty
character
a
hint
of
smoke
and
a
low
to
moderate
bitterness
i
enjoyed
it
very
nice
dunkel
great
dark
malt
flavor
without
any
roasted
malt
bitterness
very
drinkable
great
find
in
this
part
of
the
world
tastemouthfeel
definitely
has
that
musty
german
flavor
to
it
heavily
malted
with
hints
of
coffee
molasses
and
raisins
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
could
use
some
more
carbonation
definitely
too
light
i
know
its
a
lager
but
this
is
too
clean
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
smooth
brew
with
good
flavor
after
2
or
3
you
will
be
feeling
pretty
good
a
bit
pricey
for
what
it
is
though
its
a
great
beer
that
packs
a
punch
and
leave
a
good
aftertaste
not
dry
at
all
down
to
the
last
drop
a
truly
notable
brew
overall
a
good
dark
lager
a
great
introductory
beer
for
someone
wanting
to
ease
into
german
beers
ease
into
dark
beers
in
general
or
just
ease
into
beers
outside
the
norm
a
fine
offering
overall
this
is
a
pretty
standard
dunkel
lager
nothing
special
yet
i
would
say
its
on
the
better
end
of
the
commonly
available
dunkels
i
would
love
to
try
one
on
draft
at
a
hofbrauhaus
o
excellent
example
of
a
dunkel
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
toastier
roastier
dunkels
i
have
had
and
it
is
quite
pleasant
particularly
on
this
cool
late
summer
evening
in
colorado
i
know
oktoberfest
is
coming
but
this
would
make
a
killer
fall
porch
beer
this
way
to
easy
drinking
beer
is
quite
good
and
refreshing
a
really
good
dark
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
dark
rich
color
its
a
pretty
heavy
beer
so
it
is
something
i
tend
to
drink
on
occasion
just
for
its
great
flavor
its
presentation
is
fairly
nice
when
poured
into
a
serving
glass
this
is
honestly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
believe
it
exemplifies
what
a
dark
beer
should
look
and
taste
like
maple
brown
with
an
orangish
hue
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
thick
offwhite
foam
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
that
left
sheets
of
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
earthy
sweet
and
lightly
toasted
malt
and
dark
brown
aromas
with
toffee
toward
the
end
medium
bodied
with
smooth
but
aggressive
carbonation
through
the
middle
leaving
the
body
a
bit
thin
toward
the
end
dark
bread
and
toasted
malt
flavors
up
front
light
floral
hop
bitterness
through
the
middle
followed
by
toffee
notes
and
bready
toasted
flavors
toward
the
end
finishes
clean
and
crisp
with
floral
hop
and
bready
malt
notes
a
great
malty
german
beer
thats
very
easy
to
drink
highly
drinkable
brew
right
here
drinking
this
one
during
our
summer
camping
trip
at
frankenmuth
was
perfect
it
went
nicely
with
the
hot
dogs
and
hamburgers
that
day
and
this
is
something
i
would
gladly
have
again
i
can
enough
of
this
beer
my
all
time
favorite
hands
down
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
my
brother
went
on
holiday
to
germany
and
mention
about
this
great
beer
he
had
turns
out
las
vegas
has
a
hofbrauhaus
i
had
a
stein
and
i
fell
in
love
with
it
ever
since
o
4
overall
complex
enough
so
as
to
not
be
boring
but
easy
enough
to
drink
so
as
to
not
discourage
drinkers
not
accustomed
to
this
type
of
beer
it
manages
to
be
very
sweet
but
balanced
not
overwhelming
a
very
well
made
brew
overall
a
solid
but
unspectacular
dunkel
certainly
drinkable
even
somewhat
enjoyable
but
its
nothing
i
couldnt
live
without
poured
a
330ml
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
glass
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
bit
of
cream
colored
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
lacing
aroma
was
very
nondescript
with
some
malt
sweetness
that
may
have
been
chocolate
or
i
could
have
made
it
up
the
taste
is
about
the
same
a
little
more
depth
but
not
much
beyond
generic
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
a
little
hint
of
carbonation
and
very
smooth
all
in
all
not
bad
but
not
overly
impressive
good
malt
caramelization
but
the
mouthfeel
left
something
to
be
desired
o
enjoyable
malty
beer
with
enough
character
to
not
be
one
note
great
with
bratwurst
and
liverwurst
like
most
dark
lagers
it
lacked
a
little
body
but
overall
it
was
a
fine
example
of
this
style
overall
this
beer
is
pleasantunassuming
yes
i
am
damning
this
lager
with
faint
praise
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
i
feel
like
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
company
or
maybe
with
a
meal
its
straightforward
and
gives
the
sense
of
a
brewer
who
has
worked
hard
to
perfect
a
simple
recipe
i
would
recommend
330
ml
bottle
into
pilsener
glass
bottled
on
5142012
pours
fairly
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
1
finger
dense
light
khaki
head
with
nice
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
a
good
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
caramel
apple
pear
raisin
toast
dark
bread
molasses
herbal
floral
and
earthy

on
the

for

balance
and
robustness
of
dark
malty
flavors
with
nice
light
floral
hop
balance
and
zero
cloying
flavors
present
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
creamy
lightly
sick
and
fairly
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
dunkel
lager
nicely
robust
and
balanced
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
the
beer
is
okay
it
i
very
drinkable
and
it
is
free
of
an
technical
flaws
it
is
also
not
the
best
example
of
a
dunkel
that
i
have
had
o
well
aboveaverage
beer
not
exceptional
taste
combined
with
carbonation
makes
it
a
refreshing
beer
that
both
appeals
to
and
satisfies
the
taste
buds
overall
hofbrau
dunkle
lager
is
easy
drinking
and
a
good
representation
of
the
dunkle
lager
style
overall
drinkability
other
than
being
a
bit
too
carbonated
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
a
full
liter
of
this
over
a
good
meal
a
very
simple
and
tasty
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
and
impressive
in
its
simple
flavor
and
aroma
profile
i
think
i
like
this
far
better
than
the
original
hofbrau
i
paired
this
with
the
pork
shank
plate
which
was
also
quite
tasty
without
doubt
this
is
overall
pretty
good
dark
german
lager
also
without
any
offensiveness
in
drinkability
overall
easy
drinking
and
good
a
nice
brew
o
a
good
example
of
a
traditional
bavarian
dunkel
light
but
flavorful
malts
that
arent
at
all
sweet
makes
this
a
beer
worth
having
several
steins
of
across
an
evening
especially
if
matched
with
pork
and
sauerkraut
tasty
and
enjoyable
while
theres
nothing
about
it
that
makes
it
distinctive
its
a
solid
comfortable
beer
this
was
solid
but
didnt
really
stand
out
for
me
taste
is
nice
darkly
toasty
barley
slightly
caramelly
peppery
spice
wood
almost
a
bitter
orange
quality
like
amer
the
aperitif
very
woody
balanced
it
is
simple
and
straightforward
but
has
a
good
solid
wellrounded
character
and
is
nicely
drinkable
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
dunkel
super
roasty
and
some
nice
caramel
in
the
taste
and
easy
to
drink
would
have
it
again
oh
and
one
more
whyhow
can
there
be
no
picture
of
this
beer
on
the
site
so
i
am
uploading
my
picture
what
a
beautiful
picture
it
is
isnt
it
okay
never
mind
it
wont
upload
my
jpeg
maybe
thats
why
theres
no
pictures
o
this
is
a
roasty
and
moderately
bitter
beer
with
clean
lager
fermentation
the
subtleties
keep
this
from
be
a
two
dimensional
beer
this
dunkel
is
very
tasty
and
has
a
nice
amount
of
munich
malt
type
toasted
grain
with
slight
bready
accent
and
nutty
flavors
which
come
off
slightly
in
the
biscuit
range
with
mild
fruit
which
is
more
like
dried
fruit
or
slightly
sweet
raisin
with
a
nice
spicy
hop
finish
overall
i
was
very
happy
i
got
this
and
would
drink
it
again
i
consider
it
a
pretty
decent
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
it
is
a
nice
drinkable
dark
lager
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
quickly
receding
almost
non
existent
head
leaving
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
mild
hops
dark
figs
slight
sweet
candy
and
some
agave
oh
boy
will
this
be
another
tequila
flavored
beer
i
sure
hope
not
the
taste
holy
fruitiness
tastes
like
an
alcoholic
version
of
minute
mades
fruit
punch
dark
cherry
dark
cherry
and
more
dark
cherry
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
more
flavorful
version
of
spaten
optimator
the
mouthfeel
adds
more
dark
cherry
some
medium
grape
and
quite
an
amount
of
bitterness
not
bad
overall
this
was
a
good
easy
to
drink
beer
that
i
got
for
free
cant
beat
that
i
liked
it
some
much
a
had
to
go
out
a
get
a
12
keg
of
it
at
home
in
the
kegerator
its
just
as
good
as
ever
really
a
treat
had
this
on
tap
at
kaizerhof
in
yurakucho
tokyo
poured
into
a
glass
stein
as
a
german
dunkel
on
tap
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
from
this
it
was
a
decent
brown
lager
but
lacking
a
bit
in
appearance
and
smell
perhaps
from
a
bad
pour
although
i
cant
think
so
because
the
guys
at
kaiserhof
were
pretty
pro
but
i
found
it
just
sitting
in
a
foamless
bodiless
state
without
much
aroma
of
anything
but
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
decent
enough
and
i
would
drink
it
for
fun
but
not
much
to
write
about
here
good
but
not
amazing
o
wow
could
i
put
down
a
few
of
these
they
sure
know
how
to
do
lagers
in
munich
the
brew
pours
from
the
green
bottle
a
deep
copper
caramel
color
with
a
few
centimeters
of
dishwater
foam
indepth
malty
aroma
mixes
with
freshly
toasted
almost
nutty
character
that
strong
malt
dominates
the
flavortoasted
malt
to
biscuit
the
hops
raises
its
head
toward
the
end
to
provide
a
nice
balance
this
is
a
smooth
and
tasty
brew
had
this
one
at
the
hofbrau
house
in
las
vegas
pours
a
thin
dark
brown
color
with
a
4
inch
foamy
white
head
into
a
solid
liter
glass
the
appearance
in
this
presentation
makes
the
beer
for
me
the
beer
itself
however
is
lackluster
smells
like
german
malts
sure
maybe
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
yeast
as
well
but
nothing
particular
arousing
here
flavor
is
a
standard
dunkel
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
darker
beer
plenty
of
roast
on
the
malt
profile
and
a
breadydoughy
finish
makes
this
one
feel
like
breakfast
for
me
feel
is
fine
mellow
bubbles
and
a
medium
body
i
could
hammer
these
and
i
think
thats
the
point
the
atmosphere
of
the
pub
and
the
good
traditional
bavarian
grub
made
this
beer
seem
better
than
it
really
is
but
still
its
one
ive
come
to
appreciate
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
malt
and
some
slight
caramel
aromas
taste
is
slightly
sour
with
some
dark
malt
bread
and
caramel
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
this
one
smells
better
than
it
tastes
o
a
lot
more
complex
than
most
munich
dunkels
quite
nice
and
i
liked
the
contrast
of
dark
malts
and
hops
on
tap
at
rosies
wine
bar
pours
ruby
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
of
grain
toffee
and
honey
medium
slightly
crisp
body
toffee
toasted
malt
noble
hops
and
some
cloves
combine
on
the
palate
for
a
clean
fresh
taste
long
hoppy
finish
is
supported
by
sweet
malt
this
is
a
worldclass
dunkel
o
a
very
good
munich
dunkel
nothings
really
in
your
face
but
everything
is
balanced
impeccably
this
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
off
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
nice
fruity
and
floral
notes
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
clean
refreshing
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
lighter
than
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
good
dunkel
that
i
would
drink
again
o
not
a
bad
dunkel
and
worth
a
try
overall
its
not
what
you
would
call
complex
in
flavor
but
it
tastes
great
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
what
more
could
you
ask
for
o
good
drinkability
good
beer
hofbräu
usual
quality
many
thanks
todd
o
it
does
not
get
any
better
than
enjoying
a
liter
of
a
great
dunkel
with
the
hb
wurst
platter
and
sauerkraut
this
was
a
definite
must
while
visiting
munich
very
glad
i
did
it
and
would
enjoy
another
overall
a
solid
highly
drinkable
brew
that
was
a
good
match
for
my
turkey
sandwich
o
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
exciting
though
goes
down
easy
nice
representation
of
the
style
overall
a
great
beer
not
very
complex
but
enjoyable
simple
o
this
was
a
nice
find
in
the
import
section
glad
it
wasnt
skunked
well
worth
a
pick
up
at

a
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
34
inch
head
and
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
a
bit
skunked
with
some
caramel
and
sweet
roasted

the
flavor
is
of
caramel

barrel
candy

a

hofbrau
dunkel
is
an
average
beer
recommended
d
great
beer
tried
one
and
then
had
to
have
a
mass
just
to
make
sure
i
liked
it
enjoyed
with
a
pork
knuckle
it
tastes
as
good
as
it
looks
a
malty
hoppy
pleasure
it
makes
me
really
want
to
go
back
to
ggermany
and
visit
my
grandfathers
grave
on
a
side
note
this
one
of
my
favorites
all
around
and
also
my
go
to
choice
whenever
cooking
a
recipe
that
calls
for
an
unspecified
style
of
beer
overall
impression
while
not
being
an
oktoberfest
kerwe
festival
since
fall
2009
this
brew
brought
back
memories
and
also
is
my
favorite
from
hofbrau
most
their
biers
are
pretty
average
and
spot
on
with
characteristics
but
this
ones
flavor
was
over
the
top
and
enjoyed
every
last
drop
out
of
this
litre
what
will
be
500
for
me
who
knows
overall
just
like
i
had
in
pittsburgh
this
dunkel
is
delicious
now
all
i
have
to
do
is
go
to
munich
so
i
can
order
a
few
liters
or
drink
out
of
the
boot
color
is
a
deep
amberbrown
with
a
thick
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
caught
me
by
surprise
its
toasty
smelling
and
grainy
too
which
is
very
nice
but
something
odd
is
in
there
as
well
almost
a
bit
of
a
dry
dog
food
smell
the
taste
is
excellent
similar
to
rye
bread
toasted
with
a
dash
of
brown
sugar
nicely
balanced
seems
to
almost
finish
on
the
dry
side
with
a
slight
hop
bite
on
the
end
aside
from
the
slightly
odd
smell
its
a
wonderful
lager
i
can
only
imagine
how
great
it
would
be
on
tap
at
the
hofbrauhaus
in
munich
mouthfeel
good
creamyness
nice
carbonation
could
use
a
bit
more
if
anything
a
bit
sticky
and
cloying
body
is
medium
to
big
overall
the
dark
beer
from
this
respectable
german
brewery
is
just
that
a
very
respectable
drink
while
i
was
not
jumping
for
joy
over
it
i
would
certainly
give
it
a
look
again
not
to
mention
it
is
an
easy
drinker
and
quite
suited
for
the
current
fall
clime
o
a
great
sipper
thats
tasty
and
enjoyable
without
a
crazy
amount
going
on
had
a
mug
at
radegast
in
williamsburg
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
didnt
really
like
the
mild
black
licorice
character
but
it
was
otherwise
a
clean
drinkable
lager
i
was
hoping
for
toasty
malts
and
got
more
mellow
caramel
this
is
one
of
the
simpler
dunkels
ive
had
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
two
plus
fingers
of
frothy
beige
head
over
light
caramel
brownclean
copper
hues
active
bubbles
and
a
head
that
sticks
around
nicely
spicy
and
earthy
on
top
of
caramel
aromas
a
balance
i
appreciate
flavors
are
sugary
sweet
with
light
notes
of
chocolate
balanced
out
nicely
by
bitterness
and
fresh
hay
aromas
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
does
well
to
coat
the
palate
flavorfully
a
really
nicely
balanced
and
clean
beer
o
this
brew
has
a
very
nice
salty
character
a
beer
that
truly
is
exemplary
of
a
style
full
bodied
crisp
and
jagged
with
rough
wheat
flavoring
components
i
appreciate
the
rawness
of
this
lager
and
especially
acknowledge
that
theres
pretty
big
flavor
in
here
despite
lower
alcohol
a
very
reasonable
session
brew
and
if
i
wasnt
so
sold
on
american
ales
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
without
argument
pours
a
dark
nutty
brown
color
with
a
nice
head
that
dissipates
slowly
smells
very
malty
with
some
hints
of
spice
the
malts
definetly
come
throgh
in
the
taste
but
nothing
else
really
stands
out
coats
the
mouth
nicely
overall
a
great
drinkable
dunkle
o
good
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
see
putting
a
couple
of
these
down
with
a
hearty
german
meal
recommended
after
getting
hooked
on
the
hofbräu
original
i
had
to
try
the
dunkel
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
darks
but
this
one
will
surely
keep
a
permanent
place
in
my
fridge
simply
delicious
i
wish
i
had
tried
it
on
tap
while
at
the
old
german
beer
hall
in
milwaukee
wi
but
only
had
the
original
there
i
tried
the
dunkel
from
bottle
fresh
lightly
carbonation
nice
aroma
and
highly
recommended
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
and
i
will
be
buying
more
in
the
near
future
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
brown

with
a
decent
foamy
head
nose
is
a
woody
malt
combined
with
the
smell
of
tea

com
yup
still
here
its
a
nice
place
somewhere
you
can
enjoy
your
beers
and
sports
without
all
the
noise
and
whatnot
elsewhere
anyway
this
brew
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
dark
wheat
light
maple
syrup
very
light
roasted
malts
and
some
light
walnut
the
taste
holds
notes
of
very
light
roasted
malts
very
light
caramel
minerals
and
very
light
cashews
somehow
all
of
these
relatively
mild
flavors
combine
to
something
mostly
tasty
im
not
gonna
argue
here
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
watery
feel
overall
an
enjoyable
dark
lager
something
i
could
see
downing
a
boot
of
here
very
soon
a
nice
rich
brown
color
with
creamy
white
lacing
great
retention
and
creamy
walls
of

the
smell
is
of
caramel
with
a
touch
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
peppery
notes
a
good
noble
hop
balance
on
the
back
end
the
taste
is
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
good
touch
of
dark
roasted
flavors
some
nutty
tones
with
a
peppery
herbal
finish
of

a

not

you
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these

oan
extremely
solid

unspectacular
beer
its
a
treat
i
come
back
to
every
now
and
again
for
the
decent
taste
and
great
memories

my
time

i
enjoyed
the
hefe
a
touch
more
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
over
other
dunkels
though
drinkability
is
ok
the
price
kills
this
for
me
11
a
six
pack
is
just
too
much
d
sure
its
drinkable
and
one
i
will
look
for
on
tap
again
this
beer
appears
a
dark
walnut
hue
with
crimson
highlights
the
head
stands
in
at
a
half
inch
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
include
toffee
and
slightly
sweetened
malt
the
flavor
brings
additional
flavors
of
chocolate
and
lightly
toasted
bread
along
with
an
authentic
german
lager
taste
the
feel
is
relatively
thin
in
body
with
adequate
carbonation
the
beer
now
comes
in
a
green
bottle
which
i
find
perplexing
as
it
was
formerly
in
brown
bottles
fortunately
in
this
instance
i
did
not
detect
any
of
the
skunky
off
flavors
commonly
associated
with
imported
beers

that
only
gradually
diminished
while
drinking

aromas
with
a

of

taste
was
crisp
and
smooth
and
paired
perfectly
with
the
german

this
is
one
smooth
and
easy
drinker
a
guy
could
get
in

in

we
have
fond
memories
of
liters
of
this
beer
with
the

in

background
and
a
big
heaping
original

the

sent
to

us
is
a

consolation

are

again

very

plenty

and
very
soft
on

some
acidity
in

good

very

with
possible
a

some

on

this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
underrated
style

not

it
is
well
balanced
and
very
quaffable
good
creamy
mouthfeelnot
my
any
means
thick
but
neither
watery
hop
flavor
is
a
little
more
prominent
than
i
would
expect
lends
a
zesty
spicy
character
plenty
of
munich
flavor
drinkabilitly
i
thought
this
was
a
very
solid
beer
the
more
i
drink
german
brews
the
better
i
am
understanding
what
they
are
about
of
the
german
styles
i
have
tried
and
reviewed
thus
far
this
is
one
of
the
best
its
easily
drinkable
and
goes
down
all
too
easy
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
hesitation
a
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
flavor
an
easy
choice
to
quaff
a
few
not
the
best
but
enjoyable
smooth
and
silky
flavor
with
light
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
far
better
dunkels
out
there
this
one
reminds
me
of
a
strong
tea
thats
been
steeped
to
long
i
find
it
to
be
too
much
on
the
bitter
and
acrid
side
of
things
pours
a
clean
copper
to
orangeish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
like
a
mixture
of
a
lager
and
caramel
in
the
taste
caramel
earthy
and
a
small
fruitiness
a
smooth
and
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
fruit
and
caramel
stickiness
in
the
aftertaste
ok
nice
flavor
but
still
quite
lager
ish
d
finishes
smooth
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
couldnt
handle
a
few
in
a
sitting
but
on
its
own
very
enjoyable

with

ive
visited
hofbrauhaus
munich
four
times
and
it
never
gets
old
actually
it
reinvigorates
me
and
validates
my
passion
for
beer
with
the
people
who
mean
the
most
to
me
d
very
drinkable
beer
could
be
nice
for
a
session
as
a
compliment
for
whatever
food
or
a
great
after
work
brew
a
delight
this
beer
pours
a
rich
reddish
brown
with
just
a
little
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
mostly
of
caramel
and
malt
the
taste
matches
the
smell
exactly
with
a
little
bit
of
toasty
flavor
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
about
what
you
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
style
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
as
these
are
fairly
sweet
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
per
session
as
with
the
hofbrau
original
i
reviewed
earlier
ive
had
this
one
ontap
many
times
and
its
actually
a
personal
favourite
i
make
a
point
of
not
leaving
my
local
bavarian
cafe
leaving
without
having
at
least
one
of
these
but
in
the
bottle
its
a
slightly
different
proposition
the
coffee
aromas
and
overtones
so
notable
here
barely
rate
a
mention
in
the
tap
variety
and
this
version
also
seems
well
down
on
creaminess
which
is
something
the
other
version
had
in
spades
good
either
way
but
if
you
can
get
it
on
tap
then
thats
the
best
way
to
drink
this
one
nice
drinkability
abv
isnt
too
high
and
the
flavor
isnt
too
strong
im
drinking
these
in
the
summer
so
this
is
a
good
all
year
round
malty
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick

smell
is
sweet
nutty
with
a
little
bit

caramel
taste
is
a
wonderful
its
sweet
and
malty
finished
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
has
a
feel
that
is
soft
and
smooth
but
crisp
i
truly
enjoy
this
beer
and
need
to
find
it
in
the
states
somewhere
crystal

bready

was

was

a

light
bodied
a

dry

texture
not
bad
at
all
i
enjoyed
it
certainly
balanced
towards

but
with

presence
and

profile
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
bready
and
biscuity

with
some
toffee
and
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
semisweet
toffee
with
some
earthy

notes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium

not
a
bad
beer
just
not
to
exciting
notes
this
is
another
allaround
solid
beer
with
good
balance
and
drinkability
d
not
bad
whatsoever
a
little
different
with
the
smokier
aromas
and
darker
coffee
tastes
definitely
better
than
i
expected
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
was
through
my
glass
quickly
and
wanting
more
a
perfect
beer
on
a
warm
night
drinkable
enough
a
fairly
good
shot
at
the
style
i
remember
this
being
better
on
draft
back
in
deutschland
o
i
know
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
beer
that
defines
the
style
but
i
expected
more
fullness
and
body
its
a
good
beer
and
would
be
a
nice
foray
into
darker
beer
for
those
used
to
drinking
macro
light
beer
a
dark
amber
color
pour
with
a

lasting

leaving
lots
of
spotty

this
was
all
in

a

beer
this
was
my
first
dunlel
and
iam
very
impressed
dark
copper
in
color
malty
nose
with
hints
of
carmal
and
chocolate
the
mouth
feel
was
firm
and
satisfing
with

and
chocolate
on
the
tounge
a
thin
cream
colored
head
that
faded
to
the
edges
about
half
way
thruogh
in
my
top
10
beers
drinkability
this
style
is
growing
on
me
it
offers
some
of
the
roasted
flavors
of
darker
ales
in
a
lighter
lager
body
this
particular
example
is
benchmark
type
material
for
the
style
and
very
drinkable
this
is
almost
certainly
my
favorite
style
i
know
it
his
hard
to
brew
well
but
why
dont
americans
enjoy
something
nice
and
malty
drinkability
not
bad
definitely
worth
having
again
if
the
mood
strikes
me
just
right
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
makes
this
drinkable
but
it
is
still
kind
of
a
soft
beer
my
one
bitch
is
that
it
needs
just
a
little
edge
to
it
still
a
very
decent
brew
that
i
will
enjoy
again
drinkability
this
used
to
come
in
a
brown
bottle
so
who
knows
what
brilliant
marketing
strategy
convinced
them
to
shift
to
green
but
the
skunkiness
ruined
what
otherwise
would
be
a
nice
beer
i
have
to
say
im
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
one
great
example
and
priced
right
very
light
mouthfeel
made
edgy
by
the
dryness
and
carbonation
even
though
its
mildly
carbonated
for
me
its
too
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
to
help
with
the
balance
and
a
little
too
harsh
to
be
very
drinkable
overall
a
slightly
offbalanced
beer
from
the
bottle
unable
to
control
the
complexity
with
the
mouthfeel
id
be
willing
to
try
it
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
fairly
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thinner
mouthfeel
than
i
was
expecting
quite
drinkable
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
richness
than
i
tasted
very
straight
foward
some
milk
chocolate
sweetness
with
charred
sugar
flavors
mild
bitter
hop
finish
good
crisp
carbonation
nice
flavors
and
mouthfeel
but
a
little
lean
highly
drinkable
d
all
around
great
beer
glad
to
have
a
keg
of
this
stuff
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
strong
and
excellent
to
sit
down
and
have
a
few
of
seems
it
would
go
great
with
all
manner
of
meats
and
poultry
and
especially
sausage
probably
breakfast
too
entirely
drinkable
for
something
malty
and
on
the
dark
end
not
overbearing
in
any
way
just
a
relaxed
flavorful
brew
d
not
bad
but
very
underwhelming
nothing
about
this
beer
stands
out
besides
the
tall
head
and
clear
body
ok
drinking
but
plain
overall
this
a
very
good
dunkel
beer
heavy
and
full
of
amazing
taste
awesome
out
of
a
bottle
and
on
tap
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
tall
hansom
german
glass
that
resembled
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
was
phenomenal
i
really
enjoyed
thus
beer
this
beer
is
amazing
to
have
at
the
bar
and
is
another
great
beer
to
add
to
any
collection
value
great
value
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
solid
dunkel
someone
left
this
in
my
fridge
from
last
weekend
so
i
might
as
well
review
it
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
creamy
head
that
faded
slowly
with
no
real
lacing
the
aroma
from
this
beer
is
fantastic
it
smells
malty
sweet
with
some
graininess
and
breadyness
taking
a
sip
the
front
end
is
surprisingly
underwhelming
and
very
thin
the
flavor
builds
into
a
slightly
sweet
malty
middle
and
goes
out
a
mild
bitterness
and
then
finishes
fairly
clean
and
fast
with
just
a
hint
of
breadyness
this
is
a
decent
beer
than
smells
better
than
it
tastes
on
tap
at
nicks
german
bar
restaurant
in
worcester
served
in
a
normal
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
not
as
much
head
as
i
would
have
expected
any
prominent
smell
was
not
noticeable
taste
was
fresh
and
clean
nice
and
malty
with
a
roasted
barley
backbone
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
lager
low
abv
so
this
beer
goes
down
quite
well
this
was
a
nice
find
on

and
i
wish
they
served
it
in
mugs

i
did
not
think
that
i
would
like
this
beer
but
my
stash
was
gone
within
a
week
i
kept
coming
back
to
it
and
found
it
very
drinkable
i
will
have
it
again
when
my
desire
for
lagers
returns

the

version
of

is
so

that
it
diminishes
the
desire
to
knock
a

of

cheers
this
is
a
beer
for
avoiding
d
this
is
fantastic
the

profile
here
is

tastes
outstanding
you
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
i
highly
recommend

moderate

the
taste
is
similiar

just
a
little

mixed
in
overall
tho
this
is
a
smooth
beer
with
a
coffeechocolate
aftertaste
very
easy
to

highly
recommend
d
good
always
liked
this
dunk
but
i
think
others
have
caught
up
or
surpassed
it
did
a
sidebyside
with
the
michelob
dunkel
and
the
mich
in
my
opinion
just
blew
it
away
the
mich
was
way
more
comlex
and
refreshing
surprised
the
crap
out
of
me
overall
a
pretty
damn
solid
example
of
the
style
and
an
enjoyable
drinker
overall
its
not
something
i
would
stock
in
the
fridge
but
once
in
a
while
itd
be
nice
to
have
a
6pack
here
and
there
this
dunkel
has
a
nice
medium
body
with
vibrant
carbonation
it
really
hits
the
mark
for
a
good
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
is
still
substantial
and
not
watery
simply
an
average
beer
chestnut
brown
in
colorminimal
lacehead
rather
lean
in
the
mouth
with
a
simple
malt
componentno
real
complexity
here
perhaps
i
got
a
tired
bottle
ill
retry
this
one
it
did
however
work
with
a
hot
pretzel
and
cheese
sauce
for
breakfast
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
makes
this
beer
pretty
nice
to
drinking
seemed
a
little
filling
later
on
but
still
pretty
good
overall
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
ive
had
this
many
times
both
out
of
the
bottle
and
on
tap
and
neither
disappoints
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
it
tasts
hoppy
heavy
and
has
a
great
texture
in
my
mouth
this
is
a
very
good
beer
conclusion
nice
dunkel
lager
simple
but
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
drinkability
simple
easy
and
pleasant
definitely
not
some
huge
favorite
of
mine
but
with
pretzels
and
pork
knuckle
it
was
fantastic
at
the
brewery
by
itself
its
a
little
onedimensional
but
still
a
nice
and
interesting
brew
this
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
colour
with
ruby
highlights
which
leaves
a
two
finger
creamy
head
that
disspates
quite
quickly
and
leaves
subtle
lacing
down
the
glass
it
smells
of
dried
fruitsplums
and
spicy
hops
and
tastes
quite
sweet
with
some
caramel
backnotes
quite
nice
indeed
had
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
pittsburgh
the
color
is
a
reddish
brown
color
decent
head
to
the
beer
not
much
of
a
smell
to
it
the
smell
was
a
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
much
good
have
been
better
but
the
overall
taste
was
very
good
the
taste
was
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
but
was
of
malt
and
not
complex
overall
it
was
an
above
average
dunkel
overall
a
decent
dunkel
a
bit
more
malt
would
help
d
highly
drinkable
brew
at
5
5
abv
this
dunkel
is
very
sessionalbe
this
beer
gets
it
all
right
the
mouthfeel
and
is
nice
and
light
crisp
and
refreshing
leads
to
good
drinkability
d
excellent
i
really
enjoyed
this
wish
i
had
more
d
good
overall
a
good
beer
may
be
overhopped
for
the
style
taste
is
sour
with
a
bit
of
that
spice
promised
on
the
nose
a
good
complex
palate
with
highs
and
lows
but
at
the
same
time
taste
is
not
all
that
pleasant
tastes
like
a
standard
amber
ale
and
not
roasted
enough
to
be
dark
and
brooding
just
a
fair
amount
of
tartness
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
quite
smooth
its
drinkable
enough
but
doesnt
really
spank
me
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
the
hb
house
this
is
a
very
solid
dunkel
i
have
to
give
this
one
a
lower
drinkability
due
to
the
funny
taste
it
had
at
the
end
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
deep
copper
color
generates
about
two
fingers
of
offwhite
creamy
head
while
leaving
a
generous
amount
of
lacing
and
has
good
head
retention
smell
is
very
sweet
a
bit
of
alcohol
detected
some
malts
taste
is
similar
a
little
sweet
finishes
off
slightly
bitter
some
malts
come
through
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
smooth
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
might
drink
this
again
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
just
kind
of
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
be
it
nice
head

to

middle
of
the
road
might
get
it
again
for
a
oktoberfest
style
drinking
sessionnot
for
just
a
1
beer
sitting
d
this
is
one
of
the
prettiest
dunkel
lagers
that
ive
ever
seen
the
nice
thing
is
that
it
tastes
great
too
mouthfeeldrinkability
solid
moderate
carbonation
fuels
the
flavors
and
brings
out
the
malty
natural
elements
i
mentioned
before
great
alone
and
with
the
cheese
ive
selected
but
it
could
certainly
complement
a
burger
or
sausage
just
fine
too
a
worthy
widelyavailable
dunkel
lager
from
munich
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkel
by
this
classic
munich
brewery
i
used
this
to
wash
down
some
cheese
sausage
and
smoked
pork
chops
i
poured
the
second
bottle
right
square
in
the
middle
the
head
rose
up
thick
and
foamy
with
quite
large
bubble
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
carbonation
remained
the
same
as
previously
mentioned
more
sips
and
more
of
the
malt
made
friends
played
nice
with
my
mouth
parts
this
beer
is
even
more
enjoyable
the
second
time
around
its
full
flavorful
and
tasty
without
any
price
to
pay
in
a
surprise
ending
or
mystery
ingredients
the
beer
tasted
almost
like
a
light
porter
or
an
overweight
ale
but
definitely
not
like
guinness
the
unique
maltiness
of
the
beer
really
sets
it
off
as
being
something
special
its
a
good
beer
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
and
not
complain
i
am
probably
biased
toward
german
lager
beers
in
general
but
this
is
a
very
good
brew
that
i
appreciated
more
and
more
as
i
went
along
try
it
out
for
sure
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
decent
beer
though
i
dont
get
the
distinct
bread
crust
notes
that
are
alluded
to
in
the
style
guidelines
easy
to
drink
and
certainly
sessionable
overall
a
good
example
of
an
uncommon
style
id
really
like
to
try
this
on
draft
but
ill
consider
buying
it
bottled
again
this
beer
could
be
so
much
better
it
was
given
to
me
for
free
so
i
cant
really
complain
but
i
certainly
wont
be
drinking
this
on
purpose
again
d
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
flavor
but
would
enjoy
as
an
excellent
session
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
hofbrau
haus
in
las
vegas
the
beer
was
dark
brown
and
translucent
with
a
ginourmous
head
that
filled
half
the
1l
glass
the
smell
was
toasty
and
a
little
bisuity
only
malt
really
came
through
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
sweet
maltiness
a
little
roasted
too
the
body
was
substantial
enough
for
the
style
which
means
a
little
thicker
than
water
very
drinkable
a
topnotch
dunkel
lager
notes
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
would
buy
it
again
i
dont
go
crazy
over
dunkel
lagersbut
i
respect
this
brew
i
really
like
this
beer
and
its
a
classic
for
me
easy
to
drink
but
just
a
little
heavy
from
the
big
malt
profile
i
could
down
a
couple
easily
but
not
sure
id
want
to
session
this
lord
knows
i
did
in
munich
though
nice
malty
aroma
of
caramel
with
hints
of
chocolate
moves
into
the
quaff
effortlessly
backed
with
a
sturdy
backbone
of
roasted
malts
with
a
great
balance
of
hops
in
fact
this
one
finishes
with
a
spicy
hop
kick
for
a
dunkel
very
solid
on
all
accounts
a
great
drinking
brew
poured
from
green
bottle
to
a
hb
pilsner
glass
that
came
with
the
6
pack
sieberts
yonkers
ny
was
a
chestnut
brown
with
red
hues
and
a
minimal
cream
foam
head
smelled
like
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
sweet
caramel
tastes
fantastic
roasted
malt
sweetness
prevails
here
with
minimal
bitterness
and
crisp
sweet
finish
carbonation
gives
this
a
nice
balance
and
an
almost
creamy
feel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
seems
to
me
that
it
is
much
better
ice
cold
ok
i
had
this
one
during
a
nice
session
with
a
few
pals
this
was
the
weirdest
of
the
bunch
for
some
reason
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
brew
what
i
ended
up
with
reminded
me
of
a
generic
cola
soda
that
had
gone
flat
the
smell
mouthfeel
and
appearance
were
very
similar
to
but
not
as
sweet
as
cola
it
was
so
strange
it
was
easily
drinkable
but
not
really
appetitizing
the
taste
was
blah
it
went
down
smooth
but
i
was
unable
to
finish
a
whole
bottle
because
it
was
so
bland
for
a
beer
makes
me
sad
to
be
honest
it
wasnt
bad
persay
just
really
not
worth
the
effort
this
is
a
mediumbodied
beer
taste
starts
with
lightly
toasted
malts
closing
with
a
subtle
hop
finish
and
a
final
hint
of
citrus
from
the
wheat
d
easily
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
4
0
12oz
green
bottle
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
toffee
and
caramel
and
molasses
the
taste
like
the
aroma
features
a
good
amount
of
malt
that
is
slightly
toasted
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
dunkel
that
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
overall
hofbrau
dunkel
is
a
good
beer
that
is
representative
of
the
style
recommended
d
i
really
dont
like
this
beer
much
but
for
some
reason
that
would
not
stop
be
from
drinking
a
bunch
of
this
sessionable
if
not
delectable
its
clean
and
unoffensive
and
i
think
thats
the
point
with
this
style
recommended
will
definately
buy
some
more
of
this
already
have
bought
3
sixers
this
year
d
can
really
only
give
this
one
average
drinkability
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
necessarily
but
its
just
not
that
special
drinkability
nice
balance
yet
full
flavor
in
a
beer
that
fairly
light
and
clean
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinking
it
in
the
hofbrau
house
in
milwaukee
in
a
liter
mug
made
it
even
better
d
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
better
hofbrau
offerings
ive
had
what
the
hell
i
thought
green
glass
was
basically
against
the
law
in
germany
except
for
becks
and
spaten
because
the
beers
are
only
a
step
up
from
garbage
im
sure
this
beer
had
promise
at
one
point
but
the
glass
ruined
the
entire
experience
and
honestly
its
flavor
as
well
i
have
no
idea
how
long
this
has
been
sitting
in
a
warehouse
under
lights
heat
cold
etc
it
poured
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
roasted
malty
nose
with
some
nutty
tones
it
tastes
like
it
could
have
been
good
at
one
point
toasted
barley
mellow
aged
hop
undertones
and
an
easy
drinking
body
this
thing
was
just
off
put
this
in
brown
bottles
beer
inside
green
bottles
doesnt
have
to
be
old
to
taste
bad
by
far
my
favorite
beer
of
all
the
flavors
in
this
beer
explode
along
with
the
wonderful
aroma
of
caramel
i
usually
have
two
liters
of
this
great
beer
on
tap
at
the
heidelberg
in
nyc
the
food
and
beer
are
fantastic
i
have
never
been
disappointed
i
have
serious
trouble
trying
to
keep
my
glass
on
the
bar
mouthfeel
is
crisp
from
carbonation
bitter
easy
to
drink
extremely
sessionable
pours
a
deep
copperbrown
with
a
fizzy
white
cap
that
quickly
subsides
leaving
a
nominal
lacing
in
my
pilsn
glass
a
subtle
smell
steely
grain
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
just
a
hint
of
nuts
and
dark
fruits
a
smooth
flavor
w
a
decent
bite
more
cereal
grains
than
anything
a
bit
of
caramelnuts
present
finishes
dry
and
crisp
a
dry
light
bodied
beer
a
bit
thicker
and
wetter
than
most
dunkels
decent
co2
level
a
quaffable
brew
and
a
decent
dunkel
im
certain
to
have
this
again
poured
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
seemed
to
be
a
pretty
standard
german
dunkel
with
the
taste
and
smell
having
substantial
malt
with
overtones
of
mild
hops
seemed
pretty
mediumbodied
for
being
such
a
dark
beer
and
went
down
smooth
went
great
with
my
tacos
for
dinner
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
obviously
a
german
beer
this
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
it
smelled
malty
with
wild
hops
it
had
a
sweet
malt
and
cream
flavor
with
some
hops
in
the
aftertaste
although
it
wasnt
very
bitter
the
texture
was
fairly
thin
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
like
the
dunkel
its
a
funny
rootbeer
color
that
i
cant
say
is
brown
amber
or
reddish
but
a
strange
triangulation
of
those
colors
mostly
white
head
aroma
of
mild
toffee
and
breadlike
caramel
notes
the
flavor
is
quite
similar
but
has
a
sweet
malt
note
that
is
cut
short
by
just
the
minimum
amount
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
the
finish
barely
manages
to
become
dry
and
the
body
is
medium
i
took
a
bite
of
a
mildly
spiced
delicate
pork
sausage
with
mustard
some
onions
peppers
and
cabbage
and
pumpernickel
bread
then
took
another
swallow
of
the
beer
and
it
suddenly
came
alive
some
beers
can
seem
soso
until
you
find
the
right
food
to
activate
it
pours
a
clear
ruby
tinged
caramel
color
with
plentiful
offwhite
head
decent
tracing
to
boot
aroma
is
a
rush
of
malty
sweetness
reminiscent
of
toasted
bread
ginger
ale
a
bit
of
light
caramel
and
a
slight
nuttiness
on
the
palate
the
malts
continue
to
come
through
with
their
slight
toastiness
quite
sweet
indeed
only
a
moderate
caramel
like
amount
of
toasted
flavor
pervades
with
a
strong
nuttiness
in
the
background
barely
to
no
hop
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
finish
this
is
a
style
i
dont
plan
on
visiting
again
as
i
see
the
malt
level
close
to
cloying
and
onedimensional
d
very
good
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
a
pretty
tasty
one
at
that
ill
have
to
look
for
some
bottles
later
but
for
now
im
just
going
to
enjoy
a
few
pints
of
this
on
draught
if
you
see
this
one
dont
hesitate
not
very
complex
but
extremely
drinkable
a
nice
alternative
to
a
typical
light
lager
i
think
this
would
be
great
for
washing
down
some
kraut
and
knockworst
a
great
import
and
something
german
beer
fans
should
love
probably
the
closest
any
import
has
come
to
capturing
the
flavors
of
munich
drinkability
pretty
good
not
great
d
very
drinkable
no
alcohol
shows
through
very
satisfying
the
carbonation
doesnt
fill
you
up
even
with
a
big
sandwich

this

one
tha
i
like
to
drink
pretty
much
as
often
as
i
find
it
i
am
actually
surprised
that
i
havent
reviewed
it
until
now
because
i
drink
it
frequently
since
it
became
available
in
texas
i
would
recommend
that
you
give
this
beer
a
shot
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
quality
german
session
beer
tastes
like
plenty
of
everything
to
make

good

bring
on
the
floral
hops
and
a
punch
of
bitterness
that
is
welcome
dries
up
a

in

still
a
bit

is
not

light

does
not
lean
towards
the
middle
either
feels
in
between
the
two
carbonation
is
nice
as
it
pricks
the
tongue
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
the
sweet
presence
gets
a
bit
much
for
me
a
great
beer
from
hofbrauhaus
nicely
balanced
and
well
made
its
hard
to
find
a
flaw
in
this
one
and
it
packs
a
good
deal
of
flavor
into
a
beer
that
is
fairly
light
i
think
this
is
the
best
of
the
hofbrau
beers
that
are
available
here
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
know
ill
be
buying
another
six
pack
with
the
first
sip
i
could
taste
the
roasted
malts
but
that
was
it
after
the
first
sip
it
was
really
nothing
special
in
fact
it
sort
of
boring
not
impressed
with
this
dunkel
ale
im
really
disappointed
i
expected
much
more
this
one
is
an
old
standby
it
doesnt
pour
a
particularly
good
head
the
smell
is
a
little
on
the
skunky
side
but
that
has
been
characteristic
of
all
the
hofbrau
brews
as
one
reviewer
mentioned
the
beer
does
smell
a
little
like
wort
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
caramel
side
malty
a
little
nut
or
almond
flavor
a
little
watery
a
little
tinny
as
well
the
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
the
caramel
taste
is
a
bit
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
beer
a
little
dry
in
parts
not
the
best
dunkel
by
a
long
shot
in
part
because
it
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
and
the
metal
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
much
i
would
come
back
to
this
again
as
more
of
a
6
pack
type
of
beer
to
have
around
in
the
frig
as
opposed
to
something
special
or
of
noteworthy
merit
lchaim
a
amgnificent
example
of
the
style
so
pass
the
bread
pudding
got
this
ontap
at
one
of
clevelands
best
german
restaurants
der
braumeister
it
came
to
me
in
what
i
believe
was
a
big
and
thick
16
oz
or
bigger
official
hofbräu
mug
the
perfect
glass
for
this
beer
they
also
served
it
at
the
right
temperature
too
it
wasnt
too
cold
where
i
had
to
let
it
warm
up
or
it
wasnt
too
warm
in
where
the
beer
burned
my
upper
lip
just
the
right
temp
the
beer
was
a
dark
mahogany
with
cherry
red
highlights
all
through
out
the
beer
the
head
of
foam
on
my
glass
was
about
a
1
finger
and
it
was
a
dirty
white
color
not
a
pure
white
color
and
it
wasnt
tan
colored
either
the
smell
was
that
of
dark
roasted
malts
hint
of
chocolate
sweet
caramel
and
a
trace
of
bitter
hops
at
the
end
dark
roasted
malts
came
sweeping
in
the
beginning
and
then
gave
way
to
sweet
caramel
and
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
at
the
end
basically
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
except
for
the
fact
that
i
really
couldnt
taste
any
chocolate
it
was
medium
bodied
and
with
a
smooth
aftertaste
of
roasted
malts
with
no
alcohol
in
sight
i
could
see
why
people
at
oktoberfest
might
drink
liters
of
this
kind
of
beer
thats
because
there
is
plenty
of
good
flavor
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
dont
know
about
you
but
i
know
i
could
easily
drink
another
16
oz
mug
of
this
beer
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
it
is
another
great
german
session
beer
12
oz
bottle
color
of
clear
dark
brown
with
a
medium
head

nose
of
salt
malts
soy
sauce
barnyard
and
cocoa

taste
of
malts
baking
chocolate
and
mild
hopps
body
medium
medium
carbonation
and
acidic

aftertaste
of
sour
and
acidic
long
lasting
poured
a
deep
brown
color
which
reminds
me
of
a
coke
after
the
ice
cubes
have
melted
had
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
to
almost
nothing
but
left
some
lacing
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
slightly
chocolate
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
munich
lager
the
roasted
malt
doesnt
really
come
through
it
has
a
fizzy
light
mouthfeel
it
leaves
just
a
little
bitter
twang
at
the
end
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
not
something
i
am
overally
impressed
with
its
a
good
beer
to
get
people
to
drink
a
dark
beer
12
oz
green
bottle
with
some
code
it
pours
into
the
pilsner
glass
a
crystalclear
dark
amber
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
and
an
inch
of
tan
head
the
aroma
consists
of
roasted
malts
and
spicygrassy
hops
on
the
palate
its
roasted
lightly
toasted
and
almost
smoky
malts
spicygrassy
green
lightly
skunky
hops
and
a
medium
bitterness
it
is
a
little
bit
raw
in
the
aftertaste
and
there
is
some
heat
from
the
prickly
alcohol
presence
the
body
is
medium
and
lightly
tingly
and
leaves
a
medium
finish
overall
a
pretty
decent
dunkel
that
is
easy
enough
to
drink
but
perhaps
a
bit
unrefined
due
to
the
prickly
alcohol
pours
a
classic
munich
dunkel
color
deep
brown
with
a
very
dark
center
and
ruby
edges
no
head
to
speak
of
aroma
is
all
roasty
toasty
malts
with
some
nice
caramel
backing
but
little
else
on
the
palate
things
are
just
a
bit
onedimensional
and
flat
the
roasted
elements
of
the
malt
come
out
and
stay
out
but
they
are
not
joined
by
any
spice
smoke
or
fruit
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
overall
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
but
its
not
terribly
interesting
or
refined
a
message
for
the
other
hofbrau
drinkers
try
this
beer
and
youll
go
back
to
vegas
or
kentucky
and
let
the
other
guys
know
that
their
beer
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
german
version
i
had
this
brew
opured
from
tap
at
tanks
taproom
in
tampa
fl
the
third
tap
from
the
left
i
poured
about
one
and
a
half
finger
of
head
with
fair
retention
the
lacing
was
thin
but
apparent
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
yet
transparent
its
aroma
and
taste
were
both
malty
yet
the
smell
was
more
mild
than
the
taste
it
went
down
smooth
dont
drink
and
review
presentation
packaged
in
a
green
glass
eurostyle
glass
long
neck
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
overall
impression
great
nose
but
the
body
doesnt
back
it
up
a
solid
beer
well
crafted
but
needs
a
little
more
oomph
more
malt
i
suspect
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
a
decent
fall
sipper
or
session
but
i
doubt
ill
be
back
this
way
for
a
while
transparent
mohagany
amberish
color
with
a
nice
medium
creamy
tan
head
not
too
much
lacing
a
toasty
grainy
aroma
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
caramel
lying
underneath
flavor
begins
with
a
cereal
grain
toasty
flavor
which
controls
the
beer
some
nutty
and
caramel
characteristics
come
out
but
theyre
a
touch
weaker
a
bit
of
bitter
chocolate
lightly
earthy
and
dry
in
finish
a
bit
of
some
residual
sugar
stays
smoth
with
a
nice
combination
of
roast
flavor
malty
flavors
and
sweet
to
bitter
balance
maybe
a
touch
more
body
and
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
but
really
this
is
quite
enjoyable
very
quaffable
on
tap
it
poured
a
deep
molasses
color
with
almost
no
head
disappointment
but
the
color
was
nice
i
picked
up
aromas
of
sweet
malt
flavors
of
malt
and
touches
of
nuts
and
coffee
the
body
was
to
thin
and
wet
for
my
liking
drinkable
but
i
would
probably
only
have
one
and
move
on
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
this
was
a
real
treat
it
was
just
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
true
to
the
style
enjoyable
quite
drinkable
and
for
sure
sessionable
a
linger
of
roast
heavy
toast
and
bitter
nut
oils
linger
past
the
finish
and
the
earthy
hop
flavor
allows
for
a
smooth
transition
into
the
next
drink
all
making
this
a
clean
and
melanoidin
rich
dunkel
that
shares
a
lot
in
common
with
traditional
german
bockbiers
again
solid
i
know
some
beer
novices
who
turn
their
nose
up
at
any
dark
beer
but
i
dont
see
how
anyone
could
not
enjoy
this
one
for
its
simplicity
and
comforting
goodness
had
this
at
the
hofbrauhause
in
munich
presentation
in
a
liter
stein
is
enough
to
warrant
an
exceptional
appearance
score
alone
add
to
that
a
great
brown
color
and
frothy
head
and
you
have
a
winner
the
smell
was
subtle
i
could
find
the
roasted
malt
only
because
i
was
looking
for
it
but
a
general
smell
of
freshness
is
most
prevalent
taste
is
classic
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
this
beer
the
flavor
is
not
over
the
top
at
any
point
exceptional
balance
between
the
roasted
malt
flavor
and
small
amount
of
hops
this
beer
is
not
trying
to
grab
your
attention
its
a
classic
case
of
less
is
more
this
is
one
beer
everyone
should
have
on
tap
to
understand
the
style
and
intention
of
the
beer
in
the
us
there
is
a
mentality
that
every
beer
has
to
try
to
out
do
the
competition
and
grab
our
attention
thats
not
the
case
here
you
will
actually
be
wowed
at
the
fact
of
how
a
simple
beer
can
be
so
great
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
watery
refreshing
and
light
and
drinkability
is
insane
to
be
served
in
a
liter
stein
this
thing
has
to
be
drinkable
and
that
it
is
the
mouth
may
be
a
trifle
thin
but
it
isnt
really
that
much
of
a
flaw
as
this
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
it
is
also
one
of
those
beers
that
goes
great
with
food
on
draught
at
hofbräuhaus

mediumbodied
and
sweet
with
roasted

flavoring
the
finish
is
nutty
and
lingeringly
sweet
a
decent
beer
to
accompany
a
bratwurst
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
i
can
say
im
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
paid

for
a
half

the
hofbrauhaus

place
was
fun

okay
the

wasnt

badsee
my
beerfly
review
for
info
poured
a
bit
too
cold
with
thin
lacing
and
little
carbonation
nothing
overwhelming
in
regards
to
scent
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
had
no
qualms
about
leaving
before
i
enjoyed
another
drinkability

this
one
was
clean
and
crisp
with
a
nice
lagered
feel
and
did
the
style
justice
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
clean
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
this
brew
was
extremely
drinkable
as
the
malt
levels
were
stronger
than
expected
but
you
didnt
get
any
sense
this
was
filling
you
up
this
dunkel
lager
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
light
coffee
color
with
creamy
light
tan
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
bready
and
malty
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
bread
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
malty
feel
this
was
a
good
lager

very
easy
to
drink

even
my
grandmother
and
mom
liked
this
offering
perhaps
the
best
dark
lager
ive
tried
outstanding
had
this
beer
at
the
famed
hofbrauhaus
in
munich
dark
roasty
chocolate
with
a
lasting
head
in
a
liter
mug
smooth
and
malty
with
a
deep
brown
hue
and
excellent
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
off
white
bubbles
that
left
a
good
lacing
it
had
a
nice
malty
aroma
and
a
dark
brown
transparent
body
with
a
smooth
initial
flavor
and
a
slight
bite
while
finishing
with
a
nice
roasted
malty
flavor
when
this
brew
was
poured
into
my
glass
it
poured
a
medium
sized
head
with
fine
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
it
had
a
sweet
taste
to
it
in
my
opinion
the
hue
of
this
brew
was
almost
a
dark
brown
color
i
was
unfortunately
not
very
impressed
with
this
particular
brew
as
it
seemed
to
lack
some
character
this
beer
comes
with
a
nice
ivory
head
that
creates
a
nice
contrast
to
the
dark
reddish
brown
of
the
body
the
nose
is
mostly
of
a
robust
malt
scent
with
slightly
caramel
accents
it
gives
off
much
sweetness
when
first
sampled
but
moderates
against
a
mildly
bitter
sense
in
the
finish
it
is
fullbodied
and
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
and
was
rather
yummy
with
a
piece
of
the
black
forest
cake
so
high
it
is
balanced
partially
with
a
fork
against
the
plate
im
not
much
of
a
lager
man
really
aside
from
various
bock
beers
but
id
definitely
drink
this
again
pretty
good
dunkle
that
if
get
again
the
body
is
medium
crisp
from
beginning
to
end
and
smooth
as
well
with
a
rolling
carbonation
a
sort
of
spiciness
or
peppery
bite
translates
to
the
feel
at
the
end
of
every
sip
pours
into
a
becker
a
deep
walnut
brown
with
a
thinner
light
beige
head
atop
that
leaves
a
few
spots
of
lace
as
it
settles
syrupy
in
the
nose
with
light
nut
shellthe
sweetness
is
the
main
thing
here
to
be
expected
its
quite
malty
and
maybe
a
little
sweet
for
the
style
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
flavors
really
standing
outjust
a
light
drying
breadiness
in
the
finish
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
i
love
going
to
the
breweryrestaurant
on
the
cass
river
close
to
where
i
grew
up
o
overall
it
was
alright
a
bit
lacking
in
my
opinion
taste
its
pleasant
but
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
so
much
like
a
lager
being
a
lager
its
extremely
drinkable
but
it
has
a
somewhat
watery
consistency
and
its
lacking
big
bold
flavor
its
a
tasty
beer
and
a
dunkel
that
could
actually
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
youre
craving
a
dark
beer
that
isnt
too
heavy
in
that
instance
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
for
its
style
its
actually
very
quite
good
as
a
whole
though
its
nothing
too
special
it
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
dark
lager
beer
that
ive
ever
had
though
so
that
counts
for
something
o
smelled
like
a
solid
dunkel
with
its
malt
emphasis
without
exceeding
extreme
dark
grains
but
had
a
little
twang
underneath
it
all
the
taste
had
an
even
bigger
applelike
quality
and
also
a
more
boring
malt
take
good
feel
and
good
appearance
o
a
good
beer
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
malt
character
to
shine
through
more
bitterness
and
less
body
than
i
would
have
liked
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
one
as
the
first
of
the
variety
pack

to

a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
had
this
on
tap
at
the
frankenmuth
brewery
wasnt
able
to
watch
them
pour
it
but
it
arrived
with
a
small
one
finger
head
dark
brownmahogany
and
somewhat
cloudy
in
appearance
had
a
malty
cooked
grain
aroma
somewhat
sweet
tasting
with
a
rich
maltiness
and
light
on
hops
smooth
and
full
bodied
but
not
heavy
refreshing
dunkel
overall
very
drinkable
beer
as
they
say
liquid
bread
it
very
much
fits
the
bill
o
very
nice
dunkel
i
love
the
complexity
of
this
offering
everything
balances
out
nicely
will
get
again
appearance
is
a
transparent
brown
with
an
orange
hue
there
is
a
thin
layer
of
head
but
that
s
all
the
nose
is
distinctly
bready
malt
and
rye
bread
are
the
flavor
focus
and
this
offering
finishes
nicely
bitter
allinall
a
nice
dunkel
but
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
o
nice
combination
of
flavors
that
work
well
especially
with
the
lack
of
sweetness
with
the
fruit
they
balance
well
with
the
toasted
malt
flavors
and
spicyness
at
the
end
would
def
try
this
again
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
a
reddish
hue
singlefinger
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
a
bit
of
visible
carbonation
the
nose
has
some
faint
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
toffee
presence
the
flavor
is
similar
with
some
added
sweetness
and
a
short
burst
of
earthy
hops
toward
the
finish
body
is
medium
and
a
bit
syrupy
at
least
for
the
style
pretty
good
but
a
bit
too
sweet
o
a
nice
pleasant
light
dunkel
m
body
is
somewhat
thin
for
the
style
but
i
am
not
finding
the
carbonation
levels
to
be
as
overthetop
as
everybody
else
seems
to
be
experiencing
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
brown
color
not
overly
deep
in
color
still
able
to
see
through
it
the
head
was
a
light
brown
color
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
lightly
roasted
with
some
nice
wheat
and
clove
notes
the
taste
of
the
beer
brings
the
roasted
malts
up
and
finishes
with
a
lightly
spiced
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
still
pretty
light
for
the
style
overall
its
not
too
bad
if
i
can
find
more
dunkels
like
this
i
will
definitely
move
this
style
into
my
top
5
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
in
a
style
with
which
i
have
no
familiarity
it
seems
very
refined
and
would
be
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
lighter
bodied
quite
over
carbonated
as
well
chalking
this
one
up
to
a
bad
bottle
the

that
peel
away
sip
after
sip
heavy
toasted
taste
eventually
calms

with
an

mild

just

to
keep

very
good

for

on

with
its
authentic
german
counterparts
pours
out
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
2
finger
foamy
tan
head
that
leaves
good
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
hard
to
pick
up
but
did
get
a
little
bread
and
some
sweet
malts
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
hops
followed
by
some
chocolate
malts
raisins
and
coffee
with
a
roasted
and
smoked
flavor
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
overall
a
very
good
tasting
beer
first
time
i
have
tried
this
style
and
hope
others
i
try
will
be
as
good
as
this
one
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
seems
to
be
missing
a
few
key
style
elements
mainly
the
depth
of
flavor
body
and
smoothness
i
hope
the
other
frankenmuth
beers
have
more
to
offer
than
this
taste
is
equally
tart
as
the
aroma
ripe
green
apple
yeast
mixed
with
toasted
and
very
litle
roasted
malt
apple
start
faint
biscuit
middle
with
just
a
touch
of
roasted
bread
crust
the
tartness
is
the
dominating
flavor
and
feel
throughout
the
whole
beer
not
bad
but
not
a
dunkel
i
will
buy
again
cheers
o
this
begs
to
be
paired
with
a
plate
full
of
suasage
on
this
summerlike
day
definitely
an
easy
drinker
i
would
buy
it
again
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
light
and
you
could
easily
drink
quite
a
few
if
you
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
for
me
this
is
actually
a
very
nice
session
beer
and
my
bias
would
rate
this
a
little
higher
personally
than
i
would
for
a
review
because
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
that
said
while
very
good
its
not
a
perfect
effort
and
probably
not
as
good
as
the
original
atwater
dunkel
back
when
they
were
importing
grains
in
199798
under
their
original
brewmaster
d
not
particularly
interesting
but
drinks
fine
enough
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
dunkle
and
i
hope
the
pub
keeps
it
on
tap
so
i
can
keep
enjoying
it
also
cool
of
the
bartender
for
letting
us
sample
it
before
we
ordered
a
pitcher
even
though
i
live
close
to
the
frankenmuth
brewery
i
have
very
little
experience
with
their
beer
but
this
dunkel
may
have
sparked
some
interest
for
this
brewery
drinkability
as
the
pint
wore
on
it
seemed
to
get
worse
and
worse
having
one
is
okay
but
i
dont
think
i
would
get
it
again
inviting
hue
of
deep
ambergarnet
topped
by
a
pale
khaki
head
nice
patchy
lacing
was
noticed
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
head
diminished
malty
nose
with
some
roasted
coffee
notes
interesting
adding
to
the
complexity
of
the
nose
was
a
hint
of
toffee
and
caramel
which
became
more
prenounced
as
the
beer
warmed
smooth
clean
flavor
imparts
a
little
nuttiness
off
the
bat
flavor
moves
into
a
surprising
roasted
flavor
indicative
of
chocolate
malt
welcome
yet
unexpected
here
enters
the
coffee
and
toffee
noted
in
the
nose
with
slight
bitter
chocolate
very
enjoyable
turn
for
this
easy
drinking
lager
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
the
style
crisp
and
refreshing
despite
the
roasty
flavors
floating
around
the
interaction
of
the
bottom
fermenting
yeast
and
roasted
malts
make
this
a
good
brew
with
more
complexity
than
you
would
expect
part
of
a
sampler
at
the
brewery
this
is
another
beer
i
remember
from
before
the
big
storm
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
very
little
aroma
at
all
mild
malt
and
faint
yeast
the
flavor
is
a
little
lackluster
slightly
malty
not
really
roasted
and
then
a
yeasty
aftertaste
the
body
is
okay
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
but
it
still
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
appearance
dark
brown
with
a
thick
film
of
very
clingy
and
sticky
off
white
foam
smell
light
sour
kettle
sugars
citric
hops
taste
starts
malty
with
dark
sugars
and
finishes
with
a
bitter
hop
accent
and
a
touch
of
taertness
mouthfeel
a
little
above
medium
carbonation
and
body
overall
it
was
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
pursue
again
its
been
a
little
while
since
the
gift
set
but
i
couldnt
resist
putting
another
christoffel
beer
in
its
proper
vessel
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
russet
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
wan
foam
the
nose
comprises
dry
caramel
barley
and
a
strong
twinge
of
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
barley
and
flowers
dominating
the
proceedings
in
a
jackcheddar
string
cheese
twist
sort
of
way
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
decent
enough
dunkel
but
just
not
really
my
cup
o
tea
330ml
flip
top
bottle
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
a
small
quickly
fading
tan
head
aroma
and
taste
of
dark
caramel
malt
barley
belgium
yeast
bready
has
some
raisin
and
dark
dried
fruit
esters
and
flavor
some
tartness
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
lithe
some
sweet
malt
and
yeast
on
the
tongue
finish
is
sweet
caramel
malt
yeasty
and
bready
with
some
dried
dark
fruit
and
mild
bitterness
overall
a
good
drinking
brew
o
hard
to
say
on
this
one
maybe
it
has
gone
bad
but
the
sour
has
potential
in
this
had
i
known
it
was
coming
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
because
it
is
very
drinkable
and
tastes
like
a
light
version
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
that
has
been
aged
and
has
lots
of
yeast
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
overall
if
you
see
a
christoffel
blond
grab
it
if
you
see
this
best
leave
it
alone
overall
an
unimpressive
beer
too
focused
on
malts
to
be
pleasant
to
drink
od
nice
strongish
dark
lager
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
while
being
complex
sweet
and
interesting
overall
an
interesting
experimental
beer
but
does
not
seem
like
a
great
embodiment
of
a
classical
style
impressed
from
start
to
finish
apart
from
the
head
fade
d
not
one
i
could
have
multiple
bottles
of
but
its
not
a
half
bad
bock
d
i
enjoy
this
brew
and
think
it
might
go
well
with
a
rich
meatcentric
meal
on
its
own
one
maybe
two
would
suffice
its
sweet
slightly
tart
and
robust
all
at
the
same
time
i
definitely
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
and
i
think
youll
be
pleasantly
surprised
a
nice
ale
easy
uncomplicated
but
not
a
bad
drink
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
below
average
carbonation
this
probably
accentuated
the
sweetness
this
was
indeed
a
malt
heavy
beer
i
can
have
this
beer
anytime
but
probably
wont
go
beyond
one
as
this
tends
to
satiate
your
appetite
for
beer
more
rapidly
than
any
other
beer
ive
known
so
far
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dense
for
me
smooth
but
dense
and
not
as
refreshing
as
i
like
a
vienna
lager
to
be
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
29
2009
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
dark
transparent
brown
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
heavy
on
the
sweet
malt
and
grain
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
surprisingly
good
sweet
grainy
malt
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
very
enjoyable
allinall
a
very
good
selection
i
would
seek
this
out
again
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
beer
gets
boring
after
a
while
had
this
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
a
hazy
chestnut
with
little
or
lacing
the
head
does
stick
around
for
a
bit
quite
sweet
in
the
nose
candied
malt
and
honey
the
taste
is
surprisingly
quite
a
deal
less
sweet
in
fact
id
say
it
was
more
grainy
and
with
a
firm
but
subdues
malt
background
truer
to
the
style
than
i
thought
would
be
possible
given
the
smell
not
a
terribly
exciting
beer
but
pleasant
enough
is
a
bit
more
robust
and
on
the
maltier
end
of
the
spectrum
for
the
style
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
beer
needs
something
more
flavorwise
2
5
m
2
5
d
overly
thin
body
overly
simple
and
a
bit
conflicting
mouthfeel
overall
another
noseoutweighingpalate
samplecouldnt
bother
to
taste
it
again
overall
not
bad
stuff
and
definitely
a
different
take
on
the
style
i
would
even
say
this
would
be
classified
closer
to
an
oud
bruin
style
try
it
if
its
around
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
good
i
could
drink
this
and
be
happy
but
not
a
favorite
oelergud
i
can
see
this
pairing
nicely
with
a
stilton
mouthfeel
is
light
mild
carbonation
drinkability
is
low
just
because
it
is
not
very
interesting
ive
had
much
better
vienna
lagers
which
isnt
my
favorite
style
to
begin
with
well
at
least
the
glass
that
came
in
the
gift
set
is
nice
2l
bottle
shared
with
family
really
fresh
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
brown
color
beer
with
a
nice
nig
foamy
head
with
excellent
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
some
sweet
ester
is
very
interesting
taste
is
very
smooth
with
some
creamy
notes
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
body
is
full
with
a
huge
malt
backbone
and
some
great
carbonation
i
have
to
admit
to
being
really
surprised
about
that
one
this
is
still
my
favorite
vienna
the
one
by
which
i
measure
all
others
its
authentic
and
as
true
to
style
as
you
can
get
anton
dreher
would
be
pleased
with
this
brew
when
poured
from
the
swingtop
bottle
into
my
sniffer
glass
it
had
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
tan
tightly
beaded
head
the
initial
aroma
is
fruit
possibly
raisins
followed
by
the
scent
of
sweet
wet
grains
and
toffee
the
flavor
has
a
pronounced
sweetness
with
the
roasted
grains
just
pushing
through
very
minimal
hop
presence
all
and
all
this
beer
is
a
good
medium
bodied
beverage
for
anyone
who
prefers
the
malty
side
of
beer
d
very
little
drinkability
the
flavours
are
too
odd
and
too
complex
the
alcohol
taste
also
makes
it
hard
to
put
away
its
a
worthy
beer
thats
otherwise
hard
to
come
by
hi
ho
oh
well
a
decent
vienna
style
lager
but
a
bit
too
candi
sweet
and
a
little
light
on
the
malt
i
see
this
is
a
vienna
lager
and
i
honestly
have
no
idea
if
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
this
beer
is
full
of
flavor
and
very
enjoyable
bottom
line
a
pretty
malty
sample
of
the
style
and
if
you
like
malty
lagers
this
one
will
surely
please
you
drinkabilty
is
good
as
well
this
beer
was
different
but
enough
that
i
actually
liked
it
pours
to
a
cloudy
brownish
gold
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
soon
but
leaves
good
lacing
initial
aroma
is
malty
sweetness
nuts
and
caramel
but
as
the
glass
warms
the
aroma
is
much
more
fruity
mostly
apples
and
grapes
flavor
is
a
sour
fruit
again
apples
and
grapes
and
the
finish
is
sour
and
dry
but
good
its
a
shame
this
is
not
made
any
longer
a
crisp
hoppy
bite
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
with
a
good
deal
of
effervescence
all
over
without
being
frothy
a
decent
beer
but
nuthin
great
aoma
holds
sweet
malts
that
invoke
raisin
and
fruit
cake
opaque
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
quickly
dimishing
light
tan
head
fore
is
malty
sweet
with
dark
fruit
notes
mild
caramel
and
a
light
not
quite
tartness
that
puncuates
the
malt
nicely
smooth
and
subtle
heres
a
browncrimson
brew
with
a
nononsense
malt
aroma
and
a
shallow
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
bready
with
a
bit
caramel
and
toasted
grain
theres
a
little
alcohol
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
hint
of
yeast
but
almost
no
hop
presence
the
taste
is
similar
sweet
toasty
and
malty
the
finish
is
pretty
sweet
and
the
whole
experience
is
certainly
maltcentered
i
think
that
the
brew
is
a
little
more
fruity
than
necessary
and
isnt
quite
balanced
still
this
is
a
very
tasty
very
drinkable
beer
very
appealing
for
a
malt
lover

a
dark

beer
with
some
haze
nose
is
very
caramellic
and
pale
some
maltyness
there
but
overal
not
much
to
detect
taste
is
also
very
caramellic
and
malty
but
further
missing
bit
of
taste
and
freshness
good
carbonisation
but
overal
empty
mouthfeel
drinkable
but
hard
to
find
taste
in
this
brew
so
hard
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
poured
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
moderate
lacing
aroma
was
strong
on
malts
with
toasted
bread
notes
dominating
a
bit
of
a
nutty
and
sour
element
in
there
as
well
flavors
matched
the
aromas
lots
of
residual
sugars
in
here
and
the
body
seems
a
bit
thin
maybe
this
wasnt
lagered
long
enough
hops
are
weak
in
the
background
there
are
some
nice
toasted
almond
flavors
deep
down
the
slight
sourness
i
got
from
the
pils
is
more
prevalent
here
finish
is
nice
and
clean
and
dries
out
any
off
flavors
a
decent
offering
but
nowhere
near
the
level
of
this
brewerys
pils
offering
this
beer
feels
medium
to
heavy
in
body
with
a
sharp
carbonation
sting
very
crisp
but
not
so
much
clean
finishes
with
a
light
tartness
and
a
good
hops
bitterness
that
linger
for
quite
some
time
after
the
finish
i
can
even
taste
a
hint
of
alcohol
which
is
surprising
for
6
lager
a
decent
beer
when
fresh
but
otherwise
it
can
turn
into
a
tart
cardboard
bomb
such
as
my
previous
review
that
i
edited
over
with
this
fresher
sample
to
give
it
some
justice
orange
amberreddishcopperish
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
very
malty
sweet
with
biscuity
aromas
and
no
noticable
hop
aroma
very
smooth
that
is
the
most
noticable
and
best
part
of
this
brew
taste
is
kind
of
bland
but
good
for
a
hot
one
like
today
very
easy
to
drink
and
again
super
smooth
i
catch
hints
of
bread
and
fresh
cut
grass
and
i
think
i
can
taste
bits
of
banana
but
that
doesnt
make
so
much
sense
nice
bottle
the
beer
itself
pours
a
very
nice
dark
goldish
brown
with
a
decent
head
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
dash
of
fresh
hops
the
taste
is
well
balanced
with
malt
to
the
front
with
a
sweetish
finish
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
with
the
dutch
touch
reddish
brown
ok
all
the
way
one
of
the
best
viennas
i
have
tried
not
too
malty
spiciness
and
fruit
in
the
yeast
peach
cinammon
berries
medium
mouthfeel
touch
of
roast
pinch
of
candy
sugar
and
good
finish
and
aftertaste
a
better
than
average
brew
drinkability
i
was
actually
really
impressed
with
this
beer
compex
but
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
i
picked
up
the
last
gift
pack
that
included
the
robertus
christoffel
blond
and
a
custom
glass
for
5
and
i
felt
like
that
was
a
pretty
fair
deal
if
i
saw
it
again
id
definitely
give
it
another
try
still
nice
and
well
worth
a
run
a
slightly
hazey
dark
amber
beer
with
orange
highlights
has
a
big
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
strong
graineyness
made
me
think
of
a
just
opened
bag
of
grain
a
sweet
grainy
flavor
like
grapenuts
cereal
predominates
the
flavor
with
only
a
ghost
of
bitternesson
the
finish
pours
a
hazy
amberreddish
with
a
thick
fluffy
light

mild
sweet

aromas
prevail
some

richness
noticable
interesting
palate
flavors
of
maner
malts
hop
bitterness
and
a
strange
vegetal
finish
mouthfeel
is
flavorful
but
somewhat
bitter
and
astringent
a
strange
beer
for
me
i
enjoyed
trying
it
but
wont
try
again

this
was
a
belgian

bottom
fermented
it
is
and
its
easier
to
sense
this
is
a
lager
through
the
flavour
and
aftertaste
which
still
are
very
good
malty

which
quickly
tapers
to
a
fine
lace
that
sticks
around
the
aroma
is
good
with
candy
sugars
fruit
mollases
the
taste
however
fell
a
little
short
of
my
expectations
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
moretti
larossa
but
not
with
nearly
as
much
malt
im
a
malt
fanatic
so
what
might
not
be
enough
for
me
may
satisfy
someone
else
there
is
also
a
surprising
but
subtle
hop
bite
at
the
end
with
a
nice
warming
alcohol
feeling
a
solid
but
unremarkable
beer
pretty
nice
as
it
is
though
yeah
ill
take
another
pours
a
hazy

with
a
thin
headi
get
a
slight

note
in
the
aroma
along
with
a

is
definently
malt
tilted
some
toffee
and
bready
malt
with
that
light
orangy
notepretty
appetizing
flavors
going
on
a
nice
beer
malty
and
fruity
could
handle
drinking
a
few
of
these
this
brew
is
a
hazy
brownred
color
basically
no
head
it
was
white
for
a
second
dark
malts
scent
somewhat
sweet
first
impression
with
the
taste
is
a
nice
zap
of
hop
nothing
overpowering
but
well
blended
with
a
nice
caramel
malty
base
someday
ill
be
able
to
id
the
strain
of
hops
but
i
have
had
these
before
a
more
bitter
varitey
its
good

goes

10
for
a
2pack
of
330s
with
a
glass
this
is
a
refreshing
and
interesting
brew
with
a
pleasantly
surprising
hop
emphasis
i
definitely
wish
my
bottle
started
with
a
bit
more
than
33cl
a
semicloudy
pour
that
is
an
amber
colour
with
a
tinge
of
pink
to
it
an
interesting
nose
that
is
both
tart
and
lighty
fruity
with
a
lemon
twist
and
grassy
notes
the
taste
seems
very
fresh
fruity
in
a
watermelon
sort
of
way
and
citrusy
moderately
hopped
and
the
bitterness
counterbalances
the
fruitiness
quite
nicely
a
smooth
and
lively
mouthfeel
with
nice
staying

an

this
my
favorite
beer
from
this
soild
pittsburgh
crafter
really
tasty
slightly
sweet
and
very
smooth
o
solid
tasty
probably
a
good
session
beer
not
overly
complex
but
tasty
this
review
is
for
the
draft
version
bought
bottles
to
go
and
vinegar
was
present
when
i
opened
them
at
home
it
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
copper
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
was
about
5
the
head
cleared
quickly
and
the
lacing
was
alright
mostly
spotty
the
smell
was
a
little
odd
to
me
but
enjoyable
this
will
sound
weird
but
i
got
a
baking
soda
and
vinegar
smell
along
with
nutty
wheat
i
also
got
a
bit
of
a
vinegar
and
baking
soda
taste
from
this
beer
which
wasnt
necessarily
bad
because
it
was
very
subtle
but
it
was
odd
i
also
got
some
nutty
flavors
and
a
wheat
back
end
it
had
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
nothing
overly
special
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
a
slightly
odd
way
but
i
dont
know
if
ill
buy
it
again
nose
did
not
show
the
light
sweetness
that
is
really
nice
on
the
flavor
toasted
nuts
and
cleans
up
nicely
on
the
finish
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
dunkel
and
this
beer
scratches
that
itch
quite
well
i
like
it
it
does
show
some
lager
brewing
flaws
some
diacetyl
in
particular
but
it
doesnt
work
against
the
beer
too
much
its
not
too
toasty
that
can
sometimes
just
get
a
little
acrid
when
combined
with
the
hops
i
wish
this
style
was
brewed
more
by
american
craft
breweries
it
really
hits
that
malty
sessionable
note
for
me
at
least
a
real
solid
beer
that
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
a
session
offering
for
sure
enjoyable
beer
pretty
well
balanced
but
could
be
more
complex
makes
for
a
nice
session
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
i
picked
up
a
variety
pack
of
church
brew
works
beer
on
a
recent
trip
to
pennsylvania
pious
monk
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
lot
its
a
nice
munich
dunkel
that
features
all
the
standard
bells
and
whistles
definitely
worth
checking
out
o
good
mix
of
sweet
rich
and
bready
the
flavor
is
very
full
for
a
beer
this
light
in
body
this
would
make
a
good
low
abv
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
nearly
perfect
not
a
style
i
typically
drink
or
else
i
would
consider
getting
it
again
eric
teacolored
lager
with
no
real

to
speak
of
aroma
which
is
pretty
mild
is
primarily
fruits
and
bread
flavors
of
fruit
caramel
and
faint
brown
sugar
this
lager
is
lighter
in
body
and
less
flavorful
than
i
expected
its
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
but
left
me
a
little
underwhelmed
it
is
an
easygoing
dunkelbier
and
i
would
sometimes
stop
and
look
at
it
and
wonder
if
i
was
drinking
a
yuengling
or
this
dunkelbier
overall
a
good
deal
from
church
brew
works
poured
a
medium
brown
color
hazy
but
still
seethrough
with
a
thin
wispy
layer

for

slight

from
a
subtle
cocoa
flavor
crisp
dry
finish
lightmedium
mouthfeel
nothing
that
hasnt
been
experienced
before
but
overall
quite
sessionable
overall
expected
more
depth
flavor
for
a
munich
dunkel
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
taste
was
bold
given
the
abv
im
not
sure
id
have
another
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
smooth
and
easydrinking
the
body
is
slick
and
slightly
sticky
which
really
helps
the
presentation
of
the
flavors
the
carbonation
is
only
slightly
fizzy
and
really
helps
this
beers
drinkability
crisp
and
drinkable
this
is
a
sessionable
brew
to
be
had
straight
from
the
bottle
o
couldnt
put
it
down
not
mind
boggling
my
any
means
but
a
darn
good
beer
overall
this
beer
was
ok
nothing
to
make
a
trip
to
the
store
for
though
malts
and
hops
devote
a
deep
brown
hue
similar
to
a
lager
the
thickness
of
the
beer
in
mouth
in
quite
apparent
as
well
taste
reminds
of
me
of
yuengling
a
bit
but
a
bit
more
malty
the
church
brew
works
has
other
outstanding
beers
that
overshadow
this
guy
i
feel
this
is
a
solid
brew
nice
dark
drown
to
redish
color
no
head
at
all
very
little
carbonation
bubbles
very
smooth
perhaps
a
roasty
maltly
taste
a
bit
bready
in
fact
the
lower
alcohol
content
makes
it
more
of
a
session
style
brew
this
is
what
i
would
want
with
my
steakhands
down
i
live
a
bit
north
of
the
brewery
and
hear
many
good
things
about
it
not
only
on
the
beer
side
but
the
food
is
well
talked
about
as
well
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
lager
mostly
smells
and
tastes
of
bready
malts
a
really
good
munich
dunkel
while
they
had
better
things
on
there
beer
menu
i
wouldnt
mine
trying
this
one
again

seconds

adding

a

to
it
but
it
is
pretty
subdued
medium
carbonation
level
d
could
be
complimented
with
food
but
its
missing
something
on
its
own
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
there
are
some
characteristics
of
this
brew
that
are
outside
of
what
i
am
use
to
for
a
dunkel
but
it
isnt
bad
the
abv
is
completely
hidden
and
it
is
a
decent
session
brew
d
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
dunkel
a
nice
local
offering
not
my
favorite
local
but
certainly
a
worth
a
try
i
would
enjoy
it
again
d
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
yet
there
is
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
overall
this
could
be
a
good
beer
to
have
at
the
end
of
the
evening
while
winding
down
md
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
beer
goes
down
easily
even
on
a
hot
day
certainly
a
good
take
on
a
dunkel
but
i
wouldnt
make
this
the
first
beer
you
grab
at
the
brewery
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
lager
mostly
smells
and
tastes
of
bready
malts
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
yeah
this
is
drinkable
and
worth
trying
but
nothing
real
enticing
here
slightly
above
average
at
best
remembering
to
keep
style
and
abv
firmly
in
mind
pious

dunkel
is
a

little

brew
theres
nothing
i
dislike
about
it
highly
drinkable
and
from
me
highly
recommended
d
if
i
went
their
again
i
would
order
it
again
but
since
it
was
sub
par
i
would
seek
dunkel
at
other
places
d
if
you
are
drinking
this
like
i
was
expecting
a
quality
germanstyle
dunkel
you
will
probably
be
disappointed
dunkel
is
prevalent
in
the
pittsburgh
area
and
this
is
not
one
of
the
best
i
had
up
there
out
of
three
different
breweries
it
just
does
not
have
enough
body
and
is
too
light
d
pretty
high
i
cant
say
that
this
is
the
best
beer
but
its
not
bad
d
having
one
isnt
so
bad
but
i
think
id
get
sick
of
the
flavor
real
fast
if
i
tried
to
drink
more
drinkability
i
kind
of
went
inbetween
with
this
one
its
not
bad
but
the
flavors
just
dont
seem
to
be
there
for
me
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
but
i
likely
wouldnt
seek
it
out
i
would
be
very
curious
to
try
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
if
i
come
across
them
not
a
bad
beer
although
not
the
best
dunkel
ive
had
still
i
would
choose
to
enjoy
this
beer
again
worth
checking
out
d
this
is
basically
a
follow
up
of
the
taste
and
aroma
since
dunkel
lagers
are
pretty
drinkable
by
default
considering
the
smell
and
taste
arent
that
great
this
is
basically
the
same
its
entirely
possible
my
bottle
is
old
and
has
seen
better
days
so
i
probably
owe
it
to
myself
and
to
cbw
to
make
it
over
and
try
it
from
the
source
in
general
i
put
the
church

works

at
good
with
a
strong
but
not
outstanding

presence
true
to

a
decent

of
the

certainly
worth
a
try
some

and
a
hint
of
roast
along
with
a
hint
of

and
smooth
with

this
poured
with
a
huge
bubbling
deeptan
head
that
simply
reduced
itself
to
wispiness
in
no
time
the
color
was
a
deep
colabrown
with
cherryred
highlights
the
nose
was
lightly
malty
but
that
was
about
all
i
got
a
chocolaty
flavor
on
the
tongue
and
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
about
right
for
a
lager
the
finish
had
that
same
chocolate
aspect
that
i
noted
on
the
tongue
compared
to
the
earlier
celestial

this
is
eminently
drinkable
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
would
certainly
consider
it
for
a
session

and
drinkability
overall
i
am
hoping
i
got
a
bad
batch
of
this
brew
because
it
was
dissapointing
at
best
i
wasnt
the
only
one
to
share
this
sentiment
that
night
ill
give
it
one
more
shot
and
if
nothing
changes
i
will
probably
never
try
this
or
any
of
their
brews
again
thoroughly
dissapointing
to
say
the
least
i
am
unimpressed
with
their
range
of
brews
doesnt
hold
a
match
to
penn
dark
one
half
finger
foamy
head
atop
clear
reddish
brown
color
aroma
of
roasted

taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
with
very
light
burnt
quality
lurking
in
the
background
finish
has
very
full
bready
malt
character
mouth
is
fairly
balanced
but
borders
on
wateriness
this
beer
definitely
deserved
the
accolades
it
got
at
the
gabf
id
have
another
next
time
im
in
pittsburgh
this
beer
works
for
me
doesnt
seem
quite
right
on
the
coldest
night
of
the
new
year
would
be
nice
on
a
sunny
day
in
may
nonetheless
enjoyable
for
style
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
a
beer
from
this
brewery
d
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
bottled
ive
always
found
this
to
consistently
be
their
best
offering
and
it
didnt
lose
much
in
bottling
amazing
that
this
breweryrestaurant
has
survived
while
the
strip
and
valhalla
went
under
though
i
found
them
overall
superior
but
theyve
done
a
good
job
with
marketing
and
having
a
gimmick
doesnt
hurt
either
the
beer
alter
is
so
sacrilegious
its
great
but
anyway
back
to
the
beer
this
is
a
nice
offering
worth
a
try
drinkability
kind
of
boring
to
be
highly
drinkable
bitterness
is
a
bit
much
here
and
lack
of
complexity
gives
way
to
an
overwhelming
dryness
nothing
special
dn
good
beer
could
be
better
in
the
nose
draught
at
the
brewery
this
one
was
a
copper
color
with
some
offwhite
head
to
it
it
was
fairly
clear
the
aroma
was
a
bit
thin
nothing
bad
to
it
just
not
much
there
there
were
hints
of
sweetness
and
spices
the
body
was
a
bit
of
a
medium
with
an
ok
but
nondescript
flavor
this
just
rates
an
ok
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
light
beige
head
subtle
munich
malt
chocolatey
aromas
and
some
distinctively
smelling
german
hops
it
smells
crisp
at
first
sip
it
seems
a
little
thin
but
i
suppose
the
good
roasty
quality
of
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
it
has
a
mineral
or
hard
water
type
of
feel
to
it
its
maltiness
is
sweet
and
roastytoasty
and
theres
an
inkling
of
fruitiness
its
a
slighest
bit
tart
in
the
finish
maybe
some
drying
effects
from
both
the
malt
and
hops
not
a
bad
dunkel
a
decent
sessioner
served
as
part
of
their
beer
sampler
this
one
was
a
deep
and
dark
orange
color
that
was
one
step
away
from
brown
very
clear
and
topped
off
with
a
thin
tanorange
creamsiclelike
head
of
foam
the
aroma
is
nutty
rich
with
semisweet
caramel
and
has
plenty
of
toffeelike
malt
character
after
a
few
more
whiffs
i
could
swear
i
was
getting
some
buttery
popcorn
notes
very
interesting
and
somewhat
complex
the
taste
is
nice
and
malty
richly
flavorful
with
dark
and
sweet
candy
the
body
is
just
a
few
clicks
above
medium
and
has
a
very
nice
sticky
malt
finish
overall
a
very
nice
dunkel
not
too
heavy
but
still
leaves
a
sweet
tangy
coating
on
the
tongue
by
far
the
most
malty
of
the
nights
beers
had
this
beer
on
a
recent
trip
to
the
pittsburgh
at
the
brewpub
its
served
as
a
murky
darkbrown
with
shades
of
amber
nice
offwhite
head
thats
quite
stable
the
aroma
is
composed
of
earthy
roastedmalt
smells
theres
a
yeasty
character
to
the
smell
as
well
its
moderately
carbonated
slightly
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
brief
bitterness
its
quite
tasty
and
very
drinkable
the
color
of
this
little
lager
is
a
medium
reddish
brown
with
good
clarity
this
is
lightly
malty
in
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
mildly
chocolatey
finish
i
keep
looking
for
something
a
little
more
with
this
one
that
never
arrives
thanks
for
sharing
tim
a
bit
of
a
roasty
mouthfeel
but
still
crisp
considering
it
was
a
bit
sweet
definitely
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
a
few
of
full
of
flavor
and
a
nice
roasty
scent
appearance
see
through
amber
brown
tone
off
white
head
dwindles
to
leave
behind
evenly
strung
lacing
aroma
consists
of
mild
chocolate
notes
and
roasty
malt
profile
thats
decently
robust
with
a
fruity
character
swimming
through
as
well
balanced
with
a
touch
of
german
hops
taste
out
of
the
regulars
this
is
the
one
i
would
go
with
every
time
even
balance
nice
dark
roasted
malt
character
with
a
dose
of
hops
crisp
flavor
nice
session
brew
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
range
for
the
body
even
carbonation
nice
easy
drinking
dunkel
drinkability
like
i
said
best
option
from
their
year
round
lineup
a
great
dunkel
from
the
cbw
possibly
the
best
of
their
regular
offerings
a
nice
roasted
character
makes
this
a
lager
absolutely
worth
having
again
and
fortunately
this
one
is
bottled
fantastic
and
one
id
have
again
22
oz
bottle
from
bill
scott
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
it
has
a
clean
finsh
that
one
would
expect
from
a
lager
the
drinkability
is
excellent
and
as
i
said
it
pairs
with
food
well
one
of
the
regulars
on
the
cbw
beer
list
and
it
should
be
like
its
namesake
this
is
a
refined
quiet
brew
with
a
wellrounded
if
short
finish
very
light
on
the
palate
though
with
a
darker
tone
than
one
would
expect
given
its
overall
subdued
character
very
drinkable
a
beer
to
relax
with
overall
decent
would
buy
again
but
it
didnt
impress
that
much
a
good
example
of
this
classic
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
very
drinkable
slight
sweetness
which
suits
it
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
solid
munich
lager
lacking
a
little
hit
of
dryness
to
clean
it
up
but
the
sweetness
doesnt
really
hurt
the
holzar
bier
which
they
described
as
an
export
was
lacking
it
wasnt
horrible
and
ive
had
really
good
exports
but
there
were
very
few
sweet
pils
malt
flavors
and
some
bitterness
up
front
but
overall
bland
it
was
from
the
allgäu
in
bayern
so
i
expected
more
i
guess
the
mouthfeel
was
wonderfully
thick
which
helped
me
give
it
a
3
note
no
telling
what
the
age
is
on
this
beer
o
this
beer
is
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
and
goes
down
rather
easily

easy

have
to
go

in

during

pours
a
clear
golden
brown
generous
head
that
dissipates
quickly
malty
aroma
this
bottle
had
a
mash
smell
to
it
somewhat
metallic
it
traveled
far
so
may
have
suffered
a
bit
as
a
result
taste
is
similar
to
many
dunker
lagers
surprisingly
light
and
refreshing
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
and
metallic
with
this
bottle
bready
and
malty
in
the
background
a
good
example
of
the
surprisingly
light
dunked
beers
that
i
have
tasted
from
germany
very
clean
medium
bodied
with
faint
carbonation
rounded
sweetness
and
creamy
mouthfeel
same
flavors
in
the
mouth
that
are
on
the
nose
but
everything
is
subtle
and
proportionate
finishes
clean
and
crisp
delivers
clean
malt
taste
without
being
over
bearing
and
without
lingering
sweetness
while
remaining
refreshing
simple
but
good
very
refreshing
actually
poured
from
the
flip

into
a
12

with

never
completely
subsideda
great
pour
with
deep
rich
color
alot
of

mixed
with

feel

it
is
pretty

caramel
with

maltsslightly
toasted
flavors
in
the
finisha
tinge
iron
comes
into
play
as
well
not
bad
but
not
much
complexity
to
the
beeri
think
it
would
be
nice
to
drink
next
to
a
fire
on
a
cold
bavarian
night
though
overall
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
m
the
sensation
is
nice
refreshing
not
bitter
as
should
also
not
sweet
with
a
medium
ending
not
to
pronounced
but
nice
to
the
pallet
this
poured
a
two
finger
off
white
head
upon
a
deep
copper
body
ebbing
to
a
nice
collar
of
fine
foam
little
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
scent
is
a
clean
soapy
hops
with
white
grapes
and
raisin
with
some
malt
backing
the
taste
follows
the
nose
although
it
did
not
quite
live
up
to
the
scent
slightly
sweet
with
some
grain
and
noble
hops
light
bodied
with
a
well
balanced
bitterness
this
is
a
clean
crisp
drinkable
brew
with
a
dry
lingering
finish
nothing
spectacular
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
d
a
welldone
dunkel
exactingly
tostyle
thats
flavourful
and
exceedingly
drinkable
it
isnt
complex
or
inventive
but
does
something
simple
and
orthodox
so
well
that
its
more
than
worthwhile
overall
this
is
a
great
lager
need
i
say
more
i
am
not
at
all
experienced
with
german
lagers
but
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
review
this
style
i
got
a
three
pack
of
bottles
as
a
gift
from
my
friend
who
went
to
europe
poured
into
a
hefty
glass
mug
no
head
until
i
got
nuts
with
the
pour
it
vanished
quickly
but
left
a
fancy
ring
around
the
mug
the
color
is
very
appetizing
like
a
very
dark
tea
smell
is
malt
dominated
with
a
heavy
bread
smell
very
sweet
taste
is
bready
malt
sweet
burnt
sugar
and
a
pleasant
very
mild
bitterness
thats
only
mildly
noticeable
on
the
exhale
well
carbonated
and
thin
in
the
mouth
but
yet
feels
like
a
heavier
beer
very
meal
like
overall
a
good
experience
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
some
more
lagers
of
this
sort
as
an
american
i
have
been
turned
off
to
lagers
but
when
you
go
back
to
their
roots
you
realize
a
reintroduction
is
needed
d
very
nice
drinkable
beer
nothing
complex
but
a
good
session
beer
drink
out
of
all
of
the
der
hirsch
brau
beers
ive
tried
so
far
i
think
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
most
pretty
flavourful
and
definitely
sesionable
pretty
much
all
german
lagers
are
engineered
for
easy
drinking
munich
dunkels
are
no
exception
in
that
regard
this
gets
its
job
done
as
far
as
being
characterized
by
depth
and
complexity
as
the
guidelines
call
for
this
leaves
something
to
be
desired
in
other
words
holzarbier
is
good
for
drinking
not
savoring
buyers
bare
that
in
mind
poured
a
clear
burgundybrown
with
a
lofty
and
dense
offwhite
head
sticky
lace
moderate
retention
nose
of
light
honey
sweetness
nuts
woodiness
and
some
fruit
esters
taste
is
similar
earthy
and
spicy
hops
here
something
that
i
guess
i
perceive
as
a
general
woodiness
toffee
malt
as
well
good
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
low
carbonation
nice
drink
pours
a
dark
amber
colour
with
a
head
thats
actually
a
bit
too
thick
at
first
and
then
rather
sneakily
diminishes
down
to
nothing
the
lace
however
is
quite
mesmerizing
it
slowly
creeps
down
the
glass
changing
shape
a
bit
silly
but
its
quite
fascinating
to
watch
bit
of
an
earthy
smell
plenty
of
grains
and
a
touch
of
honey
and
molasses
bit
biscuity
as
well
taste
is
essentially
similar
to
smell
with
some
caramel
and
grassiness
in
the
end
for
some
reason
this
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
honey
oatmeal
i
wonder
did
they
add
oats
to
this
beer
it
does
have
a
similar
smoothness
i
come
to
expect
from
oatmeal
stouts
very
creamy
smooth
and
light
bodied
i
like
dunkel
lagers
and
believe
they
make
a
great
session
beer
they
may
not
have
strong
bold
flavours
but
they
have
good
flavours
i
would
drink
this
again
i
would
even
seek
this
out
again
another
beer
from
this
brewery
that
did
not
disappoint
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
feels
a
little
thin
similar
to
their
other
beers
in
that
theyre
solid
and
drinkable
but
just
not
exciting
at
all
d
really
high
nice
beer
not
overly
complex
in
any
way
but
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
overall
a
very
gentle
profile
crisp
in
character
decent
but
a
little
too
much
on
the
light
side
for
me

d
well
definitely
purchase
more
if
available
lighterbodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
quite
pleasant
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
found
this
one
rather
enjoyable
a
rather
ruddy
shade
of
brown
in
colour
its
small
offwhite
head
is
poorly
retained
and
doesnt
lace
mild
toasty
aroma
with
subtle
floral
notes
smells
pretty
nice
but
its
very
restrained
the
flavour
is
sweet
and
malty
nice
caramelized
flavour
with
a
little
bit
of
bread
crust
and
some
spicy
hop
character
behind
it
all
it
may
not
be
a
very
bold
beer
but
the
flavour
is
there
light
bodied
and
finely
carbonated
yet
rich
and
smooth
on
the
palate
at
the
same
time
it
tastes
fairly
pleasant
but
its
really
the
mouthfeel
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
me
decent
got
this
as
part
of
a
3
bottle
pack
from
the
control
board
in
ontario
pours
an
amberbrown
colour
with
thick
white
head
but
without
much
lacing
smells
of
sweet
caramel
with
a
very
mild
grassy
hop
presence
flavour
is
quite
sweet
almost
no
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
smooth
carbonation
level
a
nice
enough
lager
but
would
prefer
a
bit
more
bitterness
to
it
light
cola
brown
color
light
metallic
nose
sweet
malty
wort
taste
but
not
thick
quick
fizzy
head
that
disappears
quickly
pretty
basic
pretty
delicious
could
be
consumed
in
bulk
like
a
german
session
beer
rb
calls
this
a
keller
which
would
makes
sense
as
theres
some
mustiness
going
on
here
regardless
still
not
much
to
it
not
impressed
by
this
brewer
overall
i
expected
it
to
lean
sweet
per
the
style
but
theres
a
honeyish
sweetness
in
this
one
that
limits
drinkability
for
me
though
i
did
enjoy
the
bottle
wellenough
a
solid
sweet
dunkel
lager
though
nothing
great
it
does
have
some
balance
might
be
better
fresher
no
freshness
date
d
not
particularly
exciting
but
a
very
tasty
drinker
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
strong
suits
and
this
is
a
beer
that
adds
up
to
more
than
its
individual
parts
recommended
to
anyone
who
enjoys
dark
lagers
not
the
best
dunkel
nor
the
worst
just
a
good
example
thats
right
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
still
with
so
few
making
it
to
the
us
this
is
definitely
a
good
bet
for
anyone
who
likes
the
style
and
doesnt
have
the
ability
to
fly
to
bavaria
every
time
they
want
one
got
this
at
the
local
brat
maker
ive
had
it
on
other
occasions
but
threw
the
bottle
away
without
even
seeing
who
made
the
stuff
had
a
darkish
amber
color
with
a
finger
at
most
of
head
after
a
pretty
weak
pour
i
did
get
the
hint
of
grape
but
it
was
merely
a
hint
mostly
just
a
bready
honey
sweetness
it
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
but
when
the
wife
tries
to
bring
home
a
new
beer
for
me
to
try
i
cant
complain
too
much
overall
nicely
done
especially
i
liked
that
that
the
flavour
was
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggested
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
lot
of
earthy
hops
of
front
and
a
lot
of
smooth
caramel
toffee
hazelnut
and
chocolate
notes
surprisingly
hoppy
for
a
german
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
bready
yeast
very
drinkable
without
being
watered
down
subtle
clove
spiciness
and
a
refreshing
champagne
effervescence
slightly
dry
finish
d
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
i
assume
that
my
bottle
wasnt
really
the
best
one
so
with
a
little
imagination
and
carbonation
this
would
be
a
worthy
brew
to
enjoy
serving
type
bottle
0
5
liter
fliptop
d
though
i
prefer
the
smokier
schwarzbeirs
very
similar
styles
except
munich
dunkels
are
crisper
and
cleaner
this
is
a
great
brew
to
have
when
you
need
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
also
want
something
a
little
darker
and
malty
than
a
spicy
german
pils
or
hoppy
pale
ale
this
is
far
from
the
best
example
of
the
style
which
can
be
sorta
boring
anyway
but
it
aint
al
bad
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
only
a
mildly
fizzy
head
of
colalike
foam
very
nice
color
with
blends
of
dark
brown
and
deep
reds
i
didnt
expect
this
as
i
hadnt
yet
determined
the
style
of
this
beer
i
assumed
this
may
be
traditional
bavarian
lager
simply
because
the
label
was
so
lightly
colored
aromas
of
dark
malts
and
sweet
brown
sugar
light
air
of
dark
ripe
fruit
and
bread
dominate
the
nose
the
flavor
is
certainly
not
too
big
its
mainly
of
dark
sweet
flavors
reminiscent
of
rich
bread
turbinado
sugar
and
mild
fruits
overall
id
describe
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
as
lean
but
thats
true
of
most
lagers
very
drinkable
but
with
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
pleasingly
whipped
up
froth
of
a
head
thin
yet
aggressively
popping
bubbles
all
over
a
moderately
deep
brown
sits
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
further
out
yellow
wins
out
over
any
orange
hues
presents
a
sweet
and
soft
profile
in
the
nose
without
any
truly
overt
malt
notes
you
get
pumpernickel
bread
rye
dried
molasses
green
apple
to
pear
to
red
cherry
fruit
brazil
and
hazelnuts
overall
its
stripped
down
to
an
indistinguishable
if
still
correct
core
in
the
mouth
its
mediumbodied
with
a
good
degree
of
fluidity
that
knows
when
to
slow
down
given
its
lack
of
flash
the
carbonation
is
crisp
and
feels
more
like
a
higher
quantity
of
smaller
pinpricks
than
foam
caramel
brown
sugar
molasses
flavors
appear
sans
true
sweetness
the
same
pumpernickel
to
rye
bread
profile
exists
here
more
bready
and
doughy
than
grainy
the
mineral
water
element
evokes
a
splash
of
lemon
peel
it
seems
intent
on
pleasing
in
the
most
selfeffacing
manner
possible
a
beer
to
be
consumed
heartily
by
local
men
with
big
hands
and
messy
plates
of
food
as
if
you
can
smell
the
beer
stains
permeating
the
walls
and
floors
of
the
biergärten
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
by
any
means
but
its
a
well
made
beer
not
a
bad
mda
although
this
one
is
a
touch
on
the
sweeter
side
recommended
light
to
average
body
the
taste
was
pretty
malty
with
a
medium
body
and
light
bitterness
it
had
a
semi
dry
finish
with
moderate
carbonation
in
the
brew
overall
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
3
or
4
on
a
hot
day
would
be
wonderful
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
i
could
get
ahold
of
it
more
frequently
there
is
a
slightly
off
metallic
taste
to
it
though
and
that
is
a
bit
offsetting
but
all
in
all
a
really
tasty
beer
while
pouring
this
into
a
plain
pint
glass
t
had
a
light
amount
of
white
head
the
smell
is
pretty
plain
with
no
real
mouth
watering
aromas
the
beer
itself
is
very
light
but
has
a
nice
bitterness
after
every
sip
all
around
a
sold
beer
with
a
nice
dark
amber
color
creamy
mouthfeel
and
damn
near
full
bodied
a
really
like
the
maltiness
of
this
one
its
not
a
caramel
malt
or
roasted
malt
but
just
a
nice
solid
i
would
assume
munich
malt
flavor
very
nice
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
nose
is
mild
slight
grainy
edge
a
touch
of
malts
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
flavor
has
a
good
body
to
it
with
a
thick
malt
influence
that
provides
a
hearty
experience
feel
is
pretty
good
with
a
slightly
lower
than
average
amount
of
carbonation
drinakble
sure
i
cant
classify
this
as
a
great
beer
though
even
if
you
pass
on
trying
it
you
might
not
really
be
missing
out
on
much
a
very
malty
beer
this
is
with
some
roasted
notes
but
at
the
same
time
it
misses
the
body
and
refinement
i
want
from
a
fine
dark
lager
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
like
this
is
the
way
a
munich
dunkels
is
supposed
to
be
i
suppose
this
is
the
meat
of
this
brewerys
market
which
is
sorry
however
this
brew
is
average
and
makes
for
a
decent
session
beer
clear
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
a
thin
foam
ring
and
barely
existent
top
lace
light
malt
aroma
with
a
fruity
floral
hop
layer
faint
aromas
overall
really
smooth
thickish
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
deep
roasted
malts
and
burnt
caramel
slight
prune
and
raison
tart
fruitiness
from
the
hop
bill
with
a
bitter
spiciness
developing
midway
balanced
well
overall
prune
and
charred
sugar
sweetness
for
a
finish
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
not
something
id
seek
out
again
perhaps
a
beer
best
served
on
the
warm
side
on
a
cool
fall
or
winter
evening
ive
had
much
better
beers
of
this
type
but
this
will
do
in
a
pinch
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
that
reminds
me
of
coke
with
a
nice
head
that
goes
away
fairly
slow
but
leave
no
lacing
at
all
and
doesnt
stick
around
until
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
of
malts
and
caramel
taste
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
dances
on
the
tongue
it
lingers
in
your
mouth
for
a
little
while
before
leaving
you
wanting
more
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
have
another
one
d
pretty
easy
to
quaff
light
creamy
and
not
too
sweet
i
would
drink
this
with
peas
and
asparagus
next
time
to
see
which
it
tastes
more
like
it
might
bring
out
some
of
the
beers
muted
qualities
as
well
pours
a
cola
like
brown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
nothing
special
going
on
here
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
has
a
raisin
bread
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
pretty
flavorful
nice
lightly
roasted
malt
backbone
raisin
breadiness
a
good
balance
between
the
bitter
and
sweet
the
feel
is
light
and
not
as
crisp
as
a
lager
should
be
quite
a
drinkable
brew
goes
down
easy
with
no
offensive
flavors
and
good
balance
taste
is
malty
again
with
the
sulfuric
and
husky
taste
the
dark
caramel
malts
give
the
beer
a
woody
marmelade
and
light
husky
taste
also
something
that
reminds
me
of
wort
and
biscuit
even
some
chocolate
i
guess
these
are
the
burned
malts
which
give
a
maltbitter
mouthfeel
is
good
dry
and
not
sticky
drinkability
is
almost
perfect
roasty
and
dry
which
make
the
beer
go
down
very
easily
the
drinkability
is
very
good
great
drinking
style
and
a
very
fine
version
of
it
prosit
mk
d
due
to
this
the
drinkability
would
definitely
make
it
easy
to
kick
a
few
of
these
back
and
could
serve
as
an
old
standby
kind
of
beer
but
nothing
too
spectacular
still
a
fresh
and
refreshing
german
beer
like
this
brewed
to
the
reinheitsgebot
can
be
hard
to
turn
a
nose
up
at
this
was
actually
a
bit
of
a
suprise
with
how
good
it
was
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
huge
billowing
white
head
that
settled
down
to
reveal
some
subtle
lacing
that
was
quite
nice
smell
was
of
caramel
grains
and
breads
yeast
primarily
taste
was
typical
brown
lager
some
subtle
spiceness
great
all
around
flavor
lots
of
earthy
tones
with
a
ever
so
slight
sweetness
mostly
malts
on
this
one
this
was
a
decent
beer
extremely
sessionable
and
a
samn
fine
call
a
corked
bottle
to
makes
it
a
nice
treat

it

more
subtle
than
many

ive
tried

to
be
drinkable
had
to
pour
it

ive
had
this
before
it
was

will
try
again
if
im
sure
its
fresher
the
dopplehirsch
i
bought
from
the
same
store
was
nice
caveat
emptor
this
beer
starts
with
a
dark
red
transparent
pour
into
my
glass
it
contains
golden
highlights
it
has
a
very
small
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
very
little
lacing
there
is
sweet
very
unhoppy
nose
to
this
beer
i
can
gather
some
molasses
caramel
and
something
that
smells
like
brown
sugar
there
is
nothing
floral
about
it
at
all
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
lackluster
it
had
a
medium
body
with
the
taste
of
molasses
really
sitting
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
very
little
carbonation
as
was
expected
it
goes
down
very
smooth
because
of
this
a
slight
bitterness
sneaks
out
during
the
swallow
along
with
a
metallic
lager
taste
which
doesnt
effect
the
flavor
but
is
noticable
all
in
all
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
not
great
it
is
my
first
dunkel
lager
and
i
went
into
tasting
this
purely
on
my
taste
and
not
comparing
it
to
the
style
if
you
like
octoberfest
beers
that
are

you
will

lovers

if
you
have
any
interest
in
this
style
whatsover
i
recommend
at
least
one
bottle
since
youll
be
amazed
at
how
far
the
brewers
can
back
off
and
stay
true
to
the
style
as
for
me
i
was
unimpressed
by
this
brewerys
offerings
before
popping
open
the
stopper
on
this
one
and
im
equally
unimpressed
now

about

balanced
with

i
wont
need
wood
cutting
as
an
excuse
to
drink
this
beer
very
nice
funny
that
i
picked
this
up
tonight
considering
i
was
on
my
way
home
thinking
i
need
to
find
a
dunkel
it
was
destiny

and
overal
fresh

and

on

overal
good
brew
with

not

high
carbonisation
and
plesant
mouthfeel
yes
to
me
one
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
but
quiet
cold
day
after
a
morning
working
in
the
garden
goes
wonderfully
with
bread
and
cheese
drinkability

i
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
id
like
a
dunkel
to
be
more
malty
and
pronounced
in
its
flavor
i
didnt
find
any
of
the
understatement
here
to
seem
intentional
initial
taste
is
of
moderately
dark
sweet
malt
very
smooth
i
rather
enjoy
the
slight
sweetness
of
this
beer
it
is
sweet
but
only
just
to
the
point
of
being
almost
sticky
after
that
some
light
hops
come
into
play
but
only
slightly
finishes
with
a
little
sweetness
in
the
nasal
passages
and
some
light
bitterness
on
the
tongue
overall
another
good
though
not
really
great
german
beer
further
proof
that
the
number
of
good
beers
in
this
world
outnumbers
all
the
mediocre
swill
pours
a
crystal
clear
rubybrown
with
a
finger
head
and
very
good
lace
aroma
of
a
nice
caramel
malt
with
just
hints
of
hops
flavors
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
chocolate
medium
carbonation
fairly
well
balanced
hop
presence
is
not
strong
at
all
but
the
malt
presence
is
not
overwhelming
either
finishes
crisp
and
dry
and
is
very
drinkable
a
nice
dunkle
in
a
nice
bottle
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
strong
hints
of
caramel
and
malt
appearance
was
very
nice
to
the
eye
a
perfect
amber
color
a
nice
head
forms
and
has
good
retention
well
done
from
the
brewers
many
years
of
practice
has
paid
off
in
a
wonderful
beer
a
darkmahogany
beer
with
a
very
small
off
white
fast
fading
head
crystall
clear
in
the
glass
mild
tones
of
roasted
malt
and
a
slight
caramel
flavor
is
present
hops
are
noticed
on
the
finish
with
a
dry
slightly
bitter
feel
also
a
bit
watery
on
the
mouthfeel
things
did
improve
as
the
beer
warmed
up
more
of
the
hops
and
caramel
tones
came
out
other
than
being
a
bit
watery
at
first
a
decent
and
enjoyable
brew
pouring
a
chestnut
color
with
2
inches
of
foamy
white
head
dissipating
without
much
cling
to
the
glass
however
it
leaves
a
distinct
edge
layer
maybe
a
slight
haze
as
i
look
through
the
glass
aroma
is
of
brown
malts
with
slight
caramel
tones
and
a
slight
grape
accent
not
much
else
going
on
here
taste
is
dry
oak
flavors
and
brown
malts
with
a
yeasty
finish
slightly
sweet
caramels
scattered
throughout
but
nothing
exciting
feel
is
medium
body
with
not
much
carbonation
at
room
temp
besides
a
little
tingle
on
the
tongue
on
the
initial
sip
maybe
a
drying
alcohol
on
the
finish
as
well
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
the
bottle
really
makes
this
one
in
my
opinion
beer

acton
ma
this
is
my
favorite
from
this
bavarian
brewery
one
of
the
better
munich
dunkel
lagers
that
ive
sampled
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
every
day
after
work
or
several
during
a
session
a
solid
little
beer
that
id
never
heard
of
before
i
picked
it
up
quite
enjoyable
and
if
this
were
around
when
i
was
drinking
id
probably
have
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
yet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
malts
and
dry
lager
yeast
very
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
light
malty
flavor
which
is
dominated
with
crystal
malts
it
goes
down
easy
and
refreshes
it
leaves
a
sweet
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
tasting
dunkel
but
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
suck
add
some
carbonation
please
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
drink
drinkability
notes
other
than
lacking
a
good
head
retention
this
certainly
an
above
average
dunkel
lager
paired
well
with
a
couple
of
beer
steamed
bratwursts
and
cabbage
top
popped
with
a
audible
and
visible
pop
of
co2
and
a
bit
of
beer
entered
the
atmosphere
but
no
overflow
of
liquid
so
were
good
to
go
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
12
inch
but
shortlived
head
formed
and
quickly
the
caramel
covered
liquid
was
left
with
nothing
but
a
slight
layer
of
bubbles
for
a
cap
excellent
malt
nose
and
the
malt
flavors
dominate
the
taste
as
well
im
leaning
towards
caramel
as
the
strongest
flavor
but
another
of
the
midrange
malts
could
be
in
charge
i
keep
wanting
to
think
this
could
be
darker
or
heartier
in
the
mouthfeel
but
then
i
look
at
the
dark
lager
category
and
guess
that
were
doing
admirably
medium
feel
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
i
must
have
gotten
a
good
bottle
or
something
but
this
was
an
awesome
brew
it
was
dark
amber
color
that
faded
to
a
reddishorange
color
the
head
was
white
as
snow
and
faded
rather
quickly
but
the
laceing
stayed
around
for
a
while
the
aroma
was
a
fruity
boquet
or
grapes
and
some
citrus
the
taste
was
quite
similar
but
more
on
the
malty
side
but
thats
something
i
like
not
only
was
it
nice
and
refreshing
but
it
was
something
that
i
felt
i
could
drink
at
anytime
this
was
an
exciting
brew
and
i
reccommend
it
to
anyone
it
comes
in
a
nifty
16
9oz
porcelaintype
poptop
lidded
brown
bottle
this
one
pours
an
interesting
dark
motor
oil
amber
with
a
big
bubbly
fast
fading
white
head
the
malt
aroma
gives
way
to
a
wet
grassy
scent
the
biscuity
malt
is
somewhat
sweet
and
fairly
herbal
a
slightly
metallic
tang
gives
an
edgy
quality
to
the
fruity
apple
taste
a
light
flavor
of
pineapple
lingers
in
the
distance
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
poured
a
clear
rich
copper
hue
under
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
required
a
pretty
violent
pour
to
start
then
settled
quickly
to
film
and
collar
no
lace
the
nose
is
very
mild
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
as
the
brew
warmed
the
caramel
notes
came
out
a
bit
stronger
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
mediumbodied
the
taste
is
a
bit
harsh
not
quite
sour
and
definitely
not
sweet
its
not
malty
smooth
either
but
theres
some
malt
here
a
touch
of
caramel
comes
out
in
the
finish
and
theres
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
the
main
taste
is
well
a
bit
more
substantial
than
water
but
somehow
tough
to
define
the
warmer
it
got
the
better
it
got
however
with
more
caramel
to
enjoy
still
not
a
great
beer
drinkability

im
using
this
for

beerbasted
bratwurst
its
not
good
enough
to
stand
alone
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
mahogany
body
thats
capped
by
a
thin
layer
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
the
head
drops
but
it
maintains
a
creamy
collar
and
leaves
some
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
fresh
and
clean
with
a
delicately
toasted
and
lightly
caramelish
malt
and
a
lightly
minerallike
characteristic
that
fades
as
it
warms
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
the
flavor
delivers
a
combination
of
almost
juicy
toasted
malt
and
spicy
hops
its
not
really
complicated
but
it
is
most
compelling
it
finishes
with
a
short
lingering
note
of
sweetish
malt
and
spice
wellbalanced
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
with
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
throughout
several
servings
certainly
worth
trying
pat
sometimes
i
am
caught
off
guard
i
did
not
expect
this
beer
to
be
outstanding
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
standard
german
dunkel
to
my
surprise
it
was
more
nice
dark
amber
color
with
creamy
off
white
head
as
well
as
roasted
malt
aromas
appeared
when
i
poured
this
into
a
22
ounce
glass
a
very
clean
looking
beer
taste
was
wonderful
smooth
and
with
a
slight
lagerlike
bitterness
but
balanced
out
with
slightly
sweet
hint
of
caramel
this
is
really
a
very
silky
beer
and
one
that
can
be
imbibed
at
any
time
this
is
their
special
amber
lager
indeed
it
is
unique
among
dunkels
and
amber
lagers
and
doesnt
quite
fit
in
but
is
an
individual
at
least
in
my
limited
experience
hardly
any
odor
dirty
copperamber
color
unlike
ive
seen
good
juicy
head
basically
a
tasty
clean
lager
with
sweet
roasty
hints
malty
hearty
with
pleasant
cleansing
taste
mellow
hops
balance
the
malts
to
make
a
toffeeish
buttery
brew
with
a
chewy
mouthfeel
and
a
very
good
finish
theres
actually
not
much
to
this
beer
its
a
bit
emptytasting
especially
for
the
price
however
its
nice
enough
and
very
drinkable
the
der
hirschbrau
line
of
beers
is
brewed
by
privatbrauerei
hoss
im
not
too
sure
where
to
put
this
beer
style
wise
it
makes
no
style
claims
on
the
label
and
it
is
someplace
inbetween
and
dunkel
and
amber
lager
it
really
needs
to
be
surved
at
cellar
temp
when
cold
it
had
a
metalic
taste
it
had
a
medium
but
persistant
head
clean
lager
feel
and
a
light
carmel
malt
sweetness
wish
i
could
purchase
some
here
to
give
it
a
proper
review
at
home
deliciously
malty
though
it
doesnt
seem
to
venture
much
beyond
that
quality
still
really
loving
this
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
seems
somewhat
sweeter
than
the
typical
munich
dunkel
but
not
cloying
the
rapid
termination
of
the
head
and
lack
of
lacing
detract
from
the
appearance
of
this
beer
the
aroma
flavor
and
palate
are
all
above
average
with
the
flavor
directing
me
to
buy
more
unfortunately
its
not
available

followed
by

maybe
figs
not
bad
not
my

it
is
representative
of
the
style
yet
malty
o
not
bad
at
all
i
could
see
getting
this
again
if
thats
the
best
thing
around
poured
a
deep
rich

a
thin
ring
of

that
dissipated
quickly
it
looks
fairly
good
like
a
dark
lager
should

of

some

nice
rich

very
simple

but
a
very
pleasant
one
that
is
quite
appealing
flavor
begins
with
malty
sweet
flavors
some
caramel
and
molasses
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
this
moves
into
more
smokey
malty
flavors

further

character
and
a

of
toasted

finish
is
smokey
toasted
and
modestly
floral
with
noble

flavor
notes
aftertaste
is
smokey
roasted
malt
and
noble
hops
a
very
nice
flavor
profile
that
actually
has
quite
a
bit
going
on
but
with
none
of
the
flavors
hurting
the
others
very
well
executed
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
semidrying
feel
quite
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
good
dark
lager
with
a
nice
aroma
and
flavor
profile
and
a
good
mouthfeel
that
lends
it
self
well
to
the
flavor
profile
worth
trying
pours
a
nice
dark
black
with
a
decent
head
smells
decent
taste
is
typical
dark
but
very
easy
to
drink
goes
down
nice
and
clean
not
a
lot
of
body
or
substance
but
a
decent
black
beer
that
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
especially
eating
japanese
yakitori
overall
an
okay
beer
given
a
choice
among
several
dark
beers
in
a
bar
or
restaurant
this
would
not
be
what
id
order
id
rather
get
say
a
guiness
however
if
it
were
the
only
dark
beer
offered
which
was
the
case
in
this
restaurant
id
get
it
again
one
thing
became
clear
though
this
doesnt
pair
well
with
sushi
im
not
sure
any
beer
would

this
is
great

i
have
a
hard
time
paying
15
for
a
6
of
this
taste
clean
light
but
tasty
dark
toast
hint
of
prunes
wine
light
zesty
bitterness
its
not
complex
flavour
is
light
but
its
firm
with
some
depth
a
very
good
drinkable
dark
lager
clean
with
nice
light
bitterness
to
back
it
up
o
an
interesting
find
not
a
bad
beer
rather
approachable
but
nothing
too
complex
or
exciting
either
i
poured
this
really
black
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
40
degrees
the
beer
was
uhhh
black
i
said
that
the
beer
poured
a
really
nice
big
head
and
i
like
that
the
beer
had
a
slight
beer
smell
oh
i
guess
it
should
really
could
not
come
up
with
anything
else
i
liked
the
beer
and
its
a
good
product
that
i
believe
i
will
will
have
to
buy
again
that
being
said
the
beer
had
a
rich
mouthfeel
and
a
silky
texture
which
i
did
enjoy
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
with
a
giant
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
roasty
with
some
pungency
and
an
unsettling
soapy
component
roasted
nuts
chocolate
licorice
molasses
wellbalanced
as
each
of
the
components
are
lacking
a
bit
a
little
shallow
when
its
all
said
and
done
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
though
largely
void
of
malt
underpinnings
and
roundness
its
understated
savory
taste
lends
itself
to
seared
fish
and
robust
sushi
dishes
quenching
but
i
feel
like
a
headache
is
not
far
away
pours
a
hazy
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
biscuit
and
slight
charlike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
roasted
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
it
smells
slightly
better
in
my
opinion
aftertaste
this
is
the
best
part
it
has
a
nice
drying
finish
to
it
but
the
flavor
dwindles
in
a
hurry
right
after
i
swallow
it
tastes
good
and
i
want
that
flavor
to
continue
but
it
doesnt
i
am
still
not
getting
any
rice
from
this
grab
a
flying
fish
wild
rice
double
ipa
that
is
what
rice
is
supposed
to
taste
like
in
a
beer
if
i
were
to
buy
an
asahi
beer
again
it
would
be
the
super
dry
we
are
having
sushi
later
i
hope
they
have
asahi
super
dry
holla
my
children
ook
but
a
little
on
the
thin
side
and
lacks
robustness
in
flavor
o
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
considered
sessionable
the
taste
was
too
close
towards
a
pepsi
cola
with
alcohol
for
me
wasnt
impressed
at
all
it
had
almost
the
same
texture
and
body
feel
as
well
a
decent
dark
lager
particularly
coming
from
such
a
large
brewery
it
looks
great
and
the
aroma
is
relatively
complex
the
flavour
is
ok
but
lacklustre
some
vitality
is
missing
nice
smooth
body
pleasant
and
easydrinking
i
could
imagine
having
this
again
worth
trying

as
i

this
was
going
to
be
i
guess
if
i
found
myself
in
the
land
of
the
rising
sun
i
would
be
supping
this
quite
good
indeed
worth
trying
this
beer
has
been
terribly
miscateogrised
on
ba
a
bottom
fermented
black
lager
is
as
much
an
english
stout
as
sake
total
bs
o
i
enjoyed
the
brew
and
it
accompanied
my
lunch
nicely
one
of
the
better
japanese
beers
i
have
had
to
date
overall
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
with
this
one
but
the
flavor
was
of
a
typical
japanese
beer
which
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
smells
a
bit
like
a
stout
and
nothing
like
i
expected
the
flavor
is
also
stoutlike
i
get
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
mixed
with
some
light
coffee
and
milky
lactose
notes
overall
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
milk
stout
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
lacks
something
in
the
flavor
profile
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
really
bitter
flavors
but
even
this
was
a
little
tame
for
me
a
nice
drinkable
stout
but
nothing
fantastic
the
maltiness
was
awesome
and
it
didnt
have
the
pinesol
hoppy
tinge
at
the
end
like
some
stouts
do
im
looking
at
you
storm
king
overall
an
alright
beer
good
but
not
the
best
japanese
mass
market
dark
beer
if
you
have
a
choice
the
stout
is
better
o
a
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
aroma
is
the
strong
point
imo
the
flavour
is
light
but
the
roasty
character
is
present
the
whole
way
through
it
is
slightly
sweet
which
is
nice
as
well
it
doesnt
have
too
much
hop
bite
which
makes
it
warmer
than
other
lagers
i
would
say
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
use
when
introducing
people
to
dark
beers
it
is
highly
drinkable
while
having
all
the
nice
qualities
of
a
dark
lager
not
that
id
buy
this
again
but
still
its
a
good
drink
it
pours
a
tempting
cola
brown
nearly
opaque
with
a
thin
tan
head
but
the
latter
may
be
an
artifact
of
the
waitress
pour
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
with
hints
of
molasses
and
caramel
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
like
a
typical
lager
but
with
a
stoutlike
undertone
of
molasses
and
a
hint
of
smoke
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
tingly
rather
typical
a
good
one
to
have
at
a
japanese
restaurant
very
drinkable
stuff
here
nothing
but
a
simple
good
drinking
sessionable
dark
brew
here
sometimes
thats
all
you
need
good
stuff
picked
up
a
bottle
at
euromarket
in
queens
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
here
but
its
basically
a
classic
inoffensive
dark
lager
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
there
was
a
smooth
body
with
just
a
little
more
weight
than
a
standard
lager
its
sweet
up
front
with
a
dry
finish
not
a
bad
beer
serving
type
bottle
a
decent
beer
from
asahi
and
a
real
surprise
i
liked
it
a
lot
particularly
for
being
light
and
refreshing
while
still
having
some
solid
bold
flavors
very
good
for
a
dark
lager
d
this
is
a
good
easy
drinker
this
beer
is
best
from
the
tap
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
working
in
japan
d
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
but
unimpressive
in
the
nose
flavor
and
feel
quite
a
stark
contrast
from
the
accolades
about
this
beer
3
5
not
a
spectacular
effort
by
any
measurement
though
a
decent
companion
drink
to
a
meal
that
doesnt
draw
away
too
significantly
not
bad
but
nothing
to
remember
possibly
a
bit
too
sweet
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
also
heavy
of
roasted
malts
some
mild
notes
of
coffee
some
notes
of
chocolate
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
drinkability
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
but
will
have
one
if
there
are
some
overall
this
beer
is
very
bland
to
me
and
is
not
as
impressive
as
many
beers
in
its
class
the
balance
is
lacking
and
its
a
straight
forward
noncomplex
brew
its
an
easytodrink
dark
lager
thats
a
good
entry
point
for
folks
who
typically
drink
pilsners
and
very
light
lagers
i
probably
wont
drink
this
beer
again

it

with
the

skewer
appetizers
overall
its
a
very
nice
beer
if
you
are
a
stout
guy
you
will
be
impressed
with
this
kind
of
beer
another
euro
dark

is
the
sapporo
black
its
like
a
stout
in
terms
of
taste
and
smell
but
its
heaps
less
heavy
d
this
was
ok
i
expected
a
little
more
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
nice
enough
a
nicely
rounded
and
fully
flavoured
dark
lager
and
true
enough
to
the
european
style
light
is
a
but
a
mere
dot
in
the
distance
for
all
those
who
might
mistake
this
lager
for
something
well
a
lot
more
ordinary
carbonation
is
much
too
high
and
the
body
is
very
watery
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
caramel
and
a
slight
sourness
the
flavor
is
nuts
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
fairly
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
pretty
good
for
a
japanese
beer
not
a
bad
beer
and
for
a
big
brewer
from
japan
i
was
fairly
happy
with
what
i
got
for
my
money
drinkability
a
munichtype
beer
according
to
the
bottle
cap
japanese
brewing
knowhow
teamed
up
with
a
germanstyle
recipe
its
good
to
see
those
two
countries
coming
together
for
something
other
than
world
domination
though
still
a
lager
brewed
with
both
rice
and
corn
it
at
least
offers
something
a
bit
different
from
asahi
d
im
not
generally
expecting
a
lot
when
i
order
one
of
the
japanese
beers
but
this
one
was
quite
good
i
would
definitely
do
so
again
if
i
see
it
on
a
menu
at
a
japanese
restaurant
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
poured
one
into
my
pint
and
tried
to
determine
how
black
it
was
its
filtered
but
still
very
hard
to
see
through
that
superdark
brown
color
the
head
which
was
thick
and
foamy
but
didnt
last
that
long
and
wasnt
lacy
didnt
give
away
too
much
from
its
smell
i
could
make
out
only
a
little
bit
of
the
smell
of
roasted
malt
and
not
much
else
it
took
a
sip
expecting
a
strong
flavor
but
was
surprised
to
find
a
roastymalty
sweetness
with
little
bitter
hoppiness
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
the
flavor
doesnt
linger
too
long
i
took
another
sip
and
another
and
another
after
3
beers
i
still
feel
like
i
could
drink
another
12
did
not
expect
such
drinkability
from
such
a
dark
colored
beer
all
in
all
the
flavor
is
not
something
that
would
make
me
drool
but
the
beer
was
a
great
was
to
relax
this
evening
and
i
would
buy
it
again
this
is
a
beer
which
while
not
bad
didnt
have
any
traits
which
left
me
wanting
more
i
doubt
ill
have
this
one
again
nice
brew
find
kirin
stout
or
yoho
brewerys
tokyo
black
those
are
great
black
beers
d
easy
to
drink
its
a
lot
better
than
most
of
the
japanese
beers
ive
had
well
worth
a
try
enjoyable
though
far
from
complex
definitely
in
line
to
make
a
good
session
beer
the
taste
is
a
letdown
but
still
highly
quaffable
with
a
faint
kick
of
toasted
coffee
and
toffee
malts
amidst
a
dominant
note
of
brown
rice
and
unsweetened
cereal
mash
highly
carbonated
mediumthin
body
that
cut
through
the
wasabi
spice
and
heaviness
of
the
sushi
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
all
things
considered
not
something
id
ever
want
as
a
standalone
brew
but
pairs
well
with
a
meal
pours
pretty
dark
brown
with
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
quite
malty
and
sweet
with
whats
coming
off
as
molasses
a
bit
too
malty
sweet
really
mellows
out
enough
as
time
goes
on
to
make
it
drinkable
enough
decent
yes
especially
coming
from
a
major
brewer
has
a
dark
black
body
thats
not
completely
opaque
and
a
nice
beige
top
it
has
a
distinct
aroma
of
a
nice
dark
toasted
malt
tastes
has
hints
of
coffee
and
cocoa
nothing
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
not
too
thin
either
definitely
one
of
the
better
asian
brews
pours
a
very
dark
red
color
body
with
an
average
creamy
head
lastingish
very
pilsnery
malty
aroma
malty
nutty
taste
some
roasted
flavor
too
light
tasting
tasty
sweet
almost
fruity
not
bad
shinerblack
like
overall
one
of
the
better
dark
asian
beers
ive
had
i
know
asia
does
not
produce
many
but
overall
a
big
surprise
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
its
actually
quite
nice
i
wouldnt
drink
it
religiously
like
guinness
but
it
would
be
nice
to
drink
it
once
in
a
while
d
very
easy
to
drink
best
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
i
honestly
was
impressed
with
this
not
being
a
standard
adjunct
lager
it
is
malty
and
flavorful
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
nice
fruity
mediumbody
and
ends
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
notes
a
pretty
good
beer
i
liked
the
taste
and
it
was
a
lot
like
the
german
dark
lagers
good
effort
from
asahi
especially
compared
to
the
massmarket
stuff
this
could
compete
with
the
very
best
from
munich
if
not
for
the
slightly
sourbitter
taste
which
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
ends
up
tasting
like
an
unintended
fusion
between
a
munich
dark
and
a
stout
of
course
this
could
be
due
to
the
rather
long
trip
from
japan
a
pleasant
beer
overall
much
preferable
to
other
supermarket
brands
had
a
very
rich
dark
color
that
lives
up
to
its
name
cannot
see
through
the
glass
and
some
decent
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
coffe
this
beer
tasted
very
chochlatey
and
coffeish
the
mouth
feel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
you
wouldnt
think
the
japenese
know
how
to
make
a
decent
dark
beer
but
i
was
suprised
overall
not
too
impressed
its
black
with
a
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
about
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fairly
closed
and
it
expresses
a
suggestion
or
really
dark
almost
burnt
caramel
but
nothing
more
its
certainly
not
roasty
or
chocolatey
and
that
mostly
follows
into
the
flavor
its
dark
but
its
not
really
roasty
and
it
has
lots
of
nutty
and
caramelish
flavors
as
well
but
only
minor
suggestions
of
chocolate
and
some
hops
appear
in
this
case
spicy
and
lightly
woody
and
leafy
it
offers
that
sweet
malty
note
at
first
but
then
it
vanishes
in
the
finish
leaving
it
clean
and
dry
again
no
roastiness
or
chocolatelike
flavors
remain
and
its
quite
drinkable
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
there
but
its
superbly
balanced
and
it
never
builds
on
the
palate
its
like
each
sip
is
its
own
little
reward
and
you
could
keep
going
back
to
the
well
all
night
for
little
dollops
of
refreshment
went
very
well
with
the
japanese
bbq
i
was
having
and
will
have
the
next
time
i
eat
at
a
japanese
place
but
its
not
my
personal
favorite
style
and
i
doubt
that
ill
buy
a
six
pack
for
its
genre
it
is
better
than
most
drinkablity
tasty
brew
easily
sessionable
but
complex
enough
to
satisfy
impressively
good
considering
the
other
more
common
asahi
beer
availible
i
like
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
people
interested
in
trying
a
bolder
beer
this
beer
is
crazy
good
for
a
commercial
import
lager
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
asap
light
bodied
and
tasty
roasty
malts
are
foremost
a
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
and
nuttyness
almost
like
a
schwarzbier
a
surprisingly
flavorful
and
balanced
offering
from
one
of
japans
largest
breweries
me
likey
might
have
to
grab
a
sixer
of
this
soon
well
after
seeing
this
beer
for
years
in
michael
jackson
books
it
finally
shows
up
in
vancouver
this
is
a
real
smooth
dark
lager
that
has
a
very
nice
malty
finish
finesse
is
the
name
of
the
game
in
this
beer
there
is
a
nutty
roasty
note
in
the
midbody
which
i
really
enjoy
so
much
more
flavourful
than
their
dry
big
dog
bark
dining
out
in
a
japanese
restaurant
for
my
daughters
birthday
this
seemd
like
the
best
bet
for
a
beverage
it
was
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
head
aroma
was
lacking
a
little
sweet
thats
all
improvement
in
the
taste
somewhat
of
a
milk
chocolatedcaramel
taste
not
unpleasant
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
in
the
mouth
but
good
enough
for
me
that
i
had
two
of
them
d
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
would
be
a
good
choice
if
out
at
a
japanese
restaurant
and
its
available
especially
in
america
id
avoid
the
kirin
and
asashi
that
are
brewed
domestically
and
the
sapporo
thats
imported
from
canada
yebisu
is
now
being
imported
and
is
a
nice
option
when
available
and
id
put
this
on
the
list
of
beers
to
order
if
available
as
well
d
this
is
a
great
beer
for
asia
but
still
a
good
beer
anywhere
else
ill
definitely
have
it
at
a
japanese
bar
anyday
poured
black
with
about
an
inch
of
short
lived
light
beige
head
had
a
malty
smell
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
odor
which
dissipated
as
the
beer
warmed
slightly
taste
was
of
a
dark
sweet
roasty
char
flavor
but
not
harshly
so
had
good
a
carbonation
level
with
a
small
nice
lingering
dark
aftertaste
overall
the
body
was
somewhat
thin
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
see
this
being
a
very
drinkable
and
delicate
dark
beer
to
go
with
japanese
food
i
liked
this
much
more
than
the
only
other
schwarzbier
ive
had
too
d
the
roasted
malt
lingers
but
doesnt
overwhelm
my
palate
three
or
four
of
these
in
a
row
is
possible
if
it
wasnt
15
a
6
pack
lacing
is
grade
a
smooth
down
the
throat
but
a
bit
to
cultured
not
the
most
flawless
blackers
but
a
good
beginner
hes
mental
for
those
snausages
drinkable
but
quite
neutral
bought
as
a
single
at
specs
in
clear
lake
overall
impression
easy
drinking
beer
no
seriously
off
flavors
fairly
clean
a
solid
offering
but
not
terribly
exciting
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
had
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
collar
it
was
dark
with
deep
mahogany
highlights
the
aroma
was
very
weak
with
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
nutty
and
alot
better
than
i
expected
after
the
disappointing
aroma
goes
down
smooth
and
had
a
bit
of
smoky
taste
to
it
similar
to
a
schwarzbier
but
weaker
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
see
trying
in
a
japanese
restaurant
if
nothing
better
around
3
5
rb
t
o
d
overally
i
would
say
this
a
fairly
good
drinkable
brew
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
when
i
am
having
sushi
i
think
its
defenitely
one
of
the
better
choices
out
there
it
certainly
beats
the
hell
out
of
the
lighter
japanese
brews
i
have
tried
a
drinkable
dark
lager
not
quite
as
good
as
those
made
in
europe
but
pretty
interesting
pours
jetblack
and
as
far
as
i
could
tell
compeltely
opaque
lots
of
nutty
malt
smells
particularly
on
pouring
and
adds
a
kind
of
burned
but
still
fairly
sweet
caramel
flavour
to
the
mix
lightbodied
but
good
carbonation
this
makes
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
lightly
flavoured
cheeses
or
sushi
pours
jet
black
with
a
miniscule
head
that
quickly
disappears
smell
is
nutty
with
a
mild
roasted
character
the
taste
is
crisp
malty
and
satisfying
light
in
body
as
it
should
be
but
not
thin
by
any
means
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
i
use
these
when
i
am
eating
light
and
i
want
a
simple
session
brew
to
accompany
the
food
i
recommend
it
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
good
dark
beer
that
isnt
too
harsh
definitely
worth
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
i
had
to
have
it
ordered
special
usually
it
is
found
in
restaraunts
drinkability
this
is
a
really
nice
alternative
to
the
usual
japanese
crap
and
its
easier
to
find
and
not
as
expensive
as
jibiru
definitely
recommended
especially
as
a
pair
with
gruyere
d
very
smooth
easy
drinker
md
mediumplus
bodied
for
a
schwarzbierstyle
lager
the
rich
and
grainy
content
makes
it
a
quite
chewy
and
enjoyable
beer
and
fortunately
the
added
corn
and
rice
are
not
played
to
the
detriment
to
the
beers
texture
thus
id
say
this
japanese
brewerys
selfappointed
task
of
producing
a
munichstyle
dark
lager
as
specified
on
the
beer
cap
is
no
disappointment
at
all
from
what
i
recall
its
unfortunately
not
nearly
as
creamy
as
it
is
from
the
tap
and
overall
its
a
rather
watery
crisp
and
clean
lager
nice
bitterness
and
roasted
character
give
this
one
more
dimension
decent
this
beer
has
a
very
lager
like
quality
its
clean
and
completely
lacking
in
esters
id
classify
it
as
a
very
good
schwarzbier
i
was
very
surprised
to
find
this
in
toronto
overall
an
excellent
beer
quite
porter
like
recommended
cheers2beers
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
very
mild
and
pleasant
if
i
had
to
pick
a
japanese
beer
right
now
it
would
be
this
one
an
easily
drinkable
dark
its
redblack
appearance
is
betrayed
by
the
lightbodied
thin
nature
of
the
beer
hence
the
easy
drinkability
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
comprehensive
flavour
with
a
thicker
mouthfeel
flavour
is
sweeter
than
expected
and
pleasing
with
cider
coffee
and
slight
pineapple
and
cherry
pit
flavors
there
is
a
weak
roasted
aftertaste
that
doesnt
linger
long
best
served
only
slightly
chilled
as
the
coldness
creates
a
false
crispness
and
masks
the
underlying
flavor
overall
a
solid
beer
good
as
an
introductory
dark
lager
poured
into
a
snifter
this
beer
had
a
smallish
but
good
head
lots
of
very
small
bubbles
like
a
belgian
it
lasted
well
laced
the
glass
and
remained
beer
was
very
black
until
held
up
to
light
when
it
showed
red
aroma
was
overwhelmingly
roasty
some
caramel
coffee
sweet
roasted
malt
light
bodied
first
taste
shows
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
perhaps
a
note
of
vanilla
overwhelming
roasted
malt
flavor
light
body
very
rich
flavors
fairly
complex
the
finish
lingers
and
is
quite
pleasing
this
japanese
black
beer
is
strangely
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
beer
im
quite
happy
with
it
theres
a
big
tan
plateau
of
a
head
dense
with
a
cookie
dough
collapse
thin
swoops
of
lacing
the
beer
is
clear
dark
redbrown
almost
black
faint
toffee
aroma
gives
away
the
dry
tangy
toffee
front
middle
is
milky
with
just
a
little
chocolate
finishes
with
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
its
quite
nice
a
light
toffee
coffee
bitter
chocolate
beer
gets
quite
nice
and
milky
in
the
middle
with
temperature
i
like
it
this
beer
has
a
solid
taste
with
a
bunch
of
flavors
coming
out
like
coffee
caramel
vanilla
nuts
and
molassas
however
it
is
not
too
sweet
or
overdone
like
other
japanese
black
beers
check
this
one
out
if
you
get
the
chanceits
one
of
japans
best
macrobrews
i
like
this
reddish
beer
its
got
a
nice
clean
coffeevanilla
taste
with
an
extremely
pleasant
finish
sure
its
on
the
lighter
side
but
its
still
loaded
with
flavor
pleasant
aroma
of
vanilla
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
cappucino
definitely
worth
trying
not
an
everyday
beer
bc
of
its
slightly
inflated
price
but
good
nonetheless
pours
black
ruby

and
fresh

coffee
medium

mouthfeel
lots
of
sweet
roasted
malts
in
the
flavor
along
with
notes
of
dark
fruits
bitter
coffee
and
burnt
toast
a
decent
brew
and
certainly
more
enjoyable
than
their
super
dry
beer
bottle
stated
this
was
a
munichstyle
beer
unfortunately
it
does
not
pass
the
bavarian
beer
purity
law
on
the
bottle
the
ingredients
in
japanese
are
listed
as
malts
hops
rice
corn
and

not
really
black

a

crisp

just
a

bitterness
not
too
complex
in
character
but
very
pleasing
colour
me
impressed
these
guys
know
how
to
make
a
good
brew
should
have
rated
it
higher
on
drinkability
but
am
unsure
try
it
hmmmm
seems
to
be
a
little
bitter
after
taste
sneaking
thru
nice
head
karakuchi
it
smells
wonderful
candy
and
sweet
strangely
so
almost
black
with
a
offwhite
fluffy
head
that
almost
held
its
suprisingly
thick
for
the
lighter
taste
slightly
sweet
not
bad
at
all
pleasant
without
being
great
flatters
to
decieve
a
bit
o
its
the
first
one
of
this
style
ive
tried
and
it
calls
for
more
trials
decent
beer
a
little
bit
reminiscent
of
scotch
ales
drinkability
not
bad
but
i
like
the
saaz
blonde
better
although
they
both
sport
cool
looking
bottles
jacobsen
odl
just
goes
to
show
that
old
school
lagers
have
actual
flavor
it
makes
you
wonder
why
more
breweries
around
the
world
are
not
brewing
malt
bombs
like
this
apart
from
the
murky
appearance
this
is
a
great
beer
go
towards
meaty
seafood
like
grilled
lobster
tail
or
panseared
scallops
with
a
side
of
mushroom
risotto
d
its
a
pretty
good
drinker
its
more
no
frills
than
lacking
its
very
easy
on
the
pocket
book
at
2
99
for
a
750
ml
id
definitely
drink
it
again
similar
to
the
saaz
blonde
in
that
respect
more
than
expected
at
the
price
drank
this
one
during
the
2
hour
lost
finale
a
nice
dark
that
is
not
too
dark
but
is
caramelly
with
darkish
fruitiness
and
does
have
a
nice
balancing
hop
touch
glad
to
have
bought
it
once
but
to
be
honest
doubt
i
would
get
it
again
for
the
price
this
one
surprised
me
big
time
the
saaz
blonde
is
a
bit
more
expensive
but
i
am
willing
to
try
it
overall
not
too
bad
i
liked
it
nothing
extraordinary
but
well
made
dark
lager
maybe
it
had
too
much
of
syrupy
feel
to
it
d
nice
fruit
flavors
but
has
too
much
of
a
syrupy
taste
and
feel
very
good
and
smooth
beer
its
a
malty
smoky
beer
with
a
toffee
or
caramel
finish
and
a
hint
of
nut
in
the
mix
with
an
overall
sweetness
to
it
cant
pinpoint
what
fruit
adds
to
the
sweetness
but
the
overall
combination
of
ingredients
in
this
beer
make
it
quite
enjoyable
d
thirst
quenching
especially
because
of
mouthfeel
goes
down
easily
a
little
too
ordinary
with
a
few
things
a
little
off
not
bad
but
overpriced
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
and
at
a
lower
price
than
the
7
99
i
saw
in
one
store
but
i
am
unlikely
to
buy
it
again
at
first
sight
in
the
glass
it
almost
looks
like
a
belgian
but
in
fact
it
is
a
great
tasting
sweet
lager
reminds
me
of
a
chimay
but
is
only
5
8
by
vol
color
was
somewhat
red
and
taste
of
an
almost
belgian
beer
smelled
a
bit

chimay

only

very
good
to
share
with
friends
a
very
good
beer
for
carlsberg
lets
get
these
in
mississippi
this
beer
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
colour
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
retention
is
decent
and
the
beer
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
good
amount
of
grassy
hops
in
the
background
some
breadiness
to
it
perhaps
a
slight
touch
of
fruit
behind
it
all
as
well
taste
is
nutty
with
caramel
notes
throughout
some
definite
fruit
plum
cherry
flavours
as
well
with
a
finish
that
is
on
the
sweeter
side
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
not
heavy
without
a
ton
of
carbonation
but
enough
to
give
a
light
spice
kick
on
the
linger
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
offers
a
pretty
wide
range
of
flavours
on
the
other
hand
it
is
too
sweet
for
my
liking
making
finishing
off
a
whole
750ml
bottle
of
it
quite
a
challenge
on
that
note
i
dont
think
id
rush
back
to
it
it
tastes
a
little
like
the
dark
lagers
of
primator
with
a
sweetish
taste
to
the
finish
i
do
find
this
quite
drinkable
keep
it
on
the
cold
side
there
is
quite
a
caramel
not
to
the
nose
and
the
intial
taste
i
liked
the
full
mouthfeel
and
the
nice
malt
backbone
nice
to
see
some
winter
offerings
from
the
big
euro
brewers
maybe
some
grolsch
bock
or
carlsberg
porter
would
be
good
d
overly
malted
taste
and
you
can
really
taste
the
glucose
syrup
sadly
i
cant
pick
up
much
else
very
smooth
likely
due
to
the
syrup
i
might
have
not
minded
a
12oz
bottle
but
when
i
have
a
28oz
bottle
it
gets
too
warm
too
sweet
and
might
best
be
used
for
fly
bait
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
munich
styled
dunkel
lager
pours
a
dark
warmed
mud
color
and
presents
a
frothy
head
that
reduces
to
a
lingering
lacing
the
beer
has
earthy
flavoring
within
it
of
figs
some
caramel
and
a
charcol
flavor
overall
a
better
one
of
the
beers
the
jacobsen
presents
so
far
tried
jacobsen
dark
lager
pours
an
orangecopper
color
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
malty
with
fruity
accents
cherry
especially
comes
to
mind
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thicker
than
i
would
have
expected
but
im
not
disappointed
by
that
the
flavor
is
also
kind
of
fruity
cherry
still
stands
out
perhaps
grape
also
as
the
beer
warms
the
finish
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
flavor
better
than
i
expected
definitely
worth
a
try
a
good
brew
id
recommend
it
to
a
malt
lover
who
just
wanted
a
nice
beer
without
all
the
alcohol
normally
found
in
the
maltier
styles
it
is
heavy
for
a
dunkel
but
it
is
nice
and
tasty
this
is
a
munich
germany
style
dunkel
lager
it
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
almost
amber
with
a
frothy
head
it
has
a
nice
lace
but
that
disperses
quickly
fig
caramel
and
hints
of
iron
chewy
creamy
and
malty
lightly
carbonated
which
makes
it
smooth
but
its
too
sweet
especially
on
the
nose
d
may
be
too
sweet
with
no
other
flavoring
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
caramel
malts
slightly
sourish
and
metallic
yeastiness
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
just
a
bit
creamy
the
aftertaste
is
mild
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
theres
nothing
very
special
about
this
beer
but
since
it
is
a
lager
youd
expect
more
sublty
than
most
ales
it
fits
some
of
the
style
profile
but
not
all
poured
a
reddishbrown
color
with
little
head
that
dissipated
rather
rapidly
aroma
is
not
real
strong
but
has
a
somewhat
sweet
malty
smell
taste
is
also
malty
and
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
little
if
any
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
okay
felt
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
beer
is
okay
but
not
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
drinkability
still
a
drinkable
beer
but
mediocre
for
the
style
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
from
it
to
begin
with
woodsy
fruity
nose
with
candy
floss
and
subtle
hops
pours
a
deep
hazy
tan
with
a
frothy
beige
cap
nice
lace
very
sweet
burnt
malts
upfront
caramel
and
plum
with
a
bit
of
leafy
hops
leading
to
a
sweet
mildly
bitter
finish
very
creamy
and
coats
the
mouth
nicely
perhaps
a
touch
too
sweet
though
d
a
bit
too
sweet
makes
it
tough
to
give
good
score
on
this
this
is
a
drinkable
but
just
barely
the
combination
of
sweetness
and
thin
body
is
not
my
style
based
on
carlsbergs
oldest
recipe
dating
back
to
1854
and
it
is
surprisingly
good
tastes
of
sweet
malts
fruits
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
that
came
through
on
the
nose
not
bad
i
can
certainly
see
myself
enjoying
a
couple
in
on
sitting
pours
a
crystal
clear
burnt
orangeamber
thick

smell
is

caramel
very
bready
and
biscuity
grassy

some

neat
taste
is
similar
but
iron
is
present
very
light
roasty
chocolate
caramel
burnt
raisins
all
malt
fruits
some
floral
solid

with

carbonation
smooth
nothing
crazy
but
pretty
solid
drinking
from
a
brewery
like
carlsberg
impressive
nordic
looking
bottle
and
my
vote
for
coolest
bottle
cap
with
bearded
man
in
profile
the
small
print
identifies
him
as
the
founder
of
carlsberg
pours
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
quickly
dissipated
head
looks
like
newcastle
with
a
slight
unfiltered
haze
malt
notes
up
front
and
center
pretty
good
overall
a
bit
expensive
would
probably
keep
me
from
buying
another
bombersix
packs
would
be
a
definite
repurchase
underated
too
sweet
to
be
real
drinkable
i
really
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
glass
of
over
sweetened
sweet
tea
in
georgia
i
like
some
sweetness
but
this
is
too
much
in
the
wrong
style
of
beer
i
like
this
one
very
much
and
wish
it
was
available
here
year

a

too
close
to
the
edge
in
its
similarity
to
a
malt
liquor
type
beer
no
subtlety
and
nothing
particularly
interesting
about
it
an
uninspired
effort
rich
dark
amber
with
a
pencil
thick
head
that
lasts
about
a
minute
shrinking
to
white
line
rimming
the
interior
of
the
glass
smells
very
malty
caramel
the
hops
aroma
is
not
very
pronounced
taste
sweet
caramel
and
very
light
on
the
hops
light
carbonation
finishing
dry
in
the
mouth
giving
the
hops
a
chance
to
be
noticed
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
the
sweetness
actually
reminds
me
of
a
cheap
dark
lager
i
used
to
find
in
my
area
long
ago
by
brasserie
fischer
although
this
carlsberg
tastes
like
a
much
more
quality
product
purchased
from
wine
society
in

jacobsen
dark
lager
is
the
best
of
the
three
carlsberg
beers
that
ive
had
so
far
i
dont
think
its
good
enough
to
warrant
being
bottled
in
750
ml
bottles
especially
at
6
99
per
but
id
consider
picking
up
a
sixer
on
occasion
if
i
could
get
it
for
that
price
the
beer
emerges
from
the
750ml
bottle
a
murky
brown
the
head
middling
in
size
and
off
white
in
color
after
decomposing
the
lace
forms
a
solid
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
crisp
clean
and
fresh
front
sweet
malt
at
the
back
pleasant
enough
start
is
sweet
with
a
decent
grain
presence
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
as
a
nice
acidity
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
combined
with
a
lingering
sweetness
a
drinkable
beer
not
great
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
d
is
it
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
no
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
but
that
is
of
course
after
having
tasted
many
lagers
before
this
and
having
found
several
favorites
in
a
pool
of
dozens
id
recommend
it
definately
imported
dark
lagers
dont
hold
up
well
and
tend
not
to
be
fresh
by
the
time
they
get
to
our
shores
my
opinion
but
this
one
held
up
well
and
is
a
good
choice
when
looking
for
a
dark
lager
serving
type
750ml
bottle
poured
into
augustinerbrau
glass
low
sweetness
make
this
a
nice
easytodrink
yet
flavorful
beer
for
the
summer
if
you
have
a
hops
phobia
not
bad
at
all
i
appreciate
carlsberg
giving
other
styles
a
try
i
guess
theyre
using
spaten
yeast
in
their
brews
so
it
makes
sense
to
give
this
style
a
shot
drank
alright
especially
for
the
abv
a
little
fresher
or
better
this
would
be
a
pretty
interesting
take
on
the
style
this
is
definitely
a
refreshing
brew
but
may
just
not
have
enough
kick
for
some
i
dont
think
im
one
of
those
people
though
i
will
come
back
to
this
one
after
ive
explored
the
style
further
not
as
dark
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
still
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
a
very
small
tan
head
on
top
caramel
and
bready
aroma
very
pleasant
caramel
sweetness
and
toasted
malt
flavor
nice
lingering
bite
in
with
the
sweetness
somewhat
nutty
flavor
good
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
very
very
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
a
late
summers
day
this
is
a
bomber
sized
bottle
but
would
be
great
in
six
packs
for
sure
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
sweet
malt
caramel
bananas
and
yeast
it
tastes
like
carameltoasted
malt
raisins
breadyeast
and
chocolate
theres
a
nice
lingering
sweet
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
as
the
beer
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
at
my
local
giant
eagle
this
morning
but
at
6
99
a
bottle
its
not
something
ill
be
buying
too
often
26
oz
bottle
enjoyable
to
drink
but
carbonation
disappears
quickly
and
goes
a
little
flat
taste
gets
better
as
it
warms
nice
malty
sweetness
but
less
pleasant
aftertaste
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
given
its
price
drinkability
goes
down
well
i
liked
it
just
felt
surprised
by
its
name
with
this
brew
dont
judge
a
beer
by
its
bottle
the
beer
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
but
just
about
dries
out
by
the
finish
there
is
a
light
tartness
here
that
is
malt
derived
chewy
caramelized
malt
notes
are
quite
noticeable
and
the
complex
malt
character
associated
with
such
notes
are
what
defines
this
beer
at
times
the
malt
takes
on
some
fruity
notes
of
raisins
and
figs
though
these
are
really
malt
derived
characteristics
fairly
light
on
the
palate
but
at
times
this
almost
seems
heavy
and
i
am
not
sure
why
almost
cloying
in
character
despite
not
being
that
sweet
this
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
certainly
nothing
to
get
excited
about
pours
a
onefingered
white
head
that
quickly
vanishes
leaving
no
lace
clear
amber
color
very
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
hoppy
nose
flavor
is
maltyhoppy
but
late
caramel
finish
7
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
capital
convenience
concord
nh
new
to
the
local
shelves
since
i
have
been
fond
of
most
carlsberg
brews
i
figured
that
i
couldnt
go
wrong
here
turns
out
a
fine
brew
with
a
solid
roasty
toasty
flavor
and
bready
yeasty
background
notes
a
fairly
creamy
texture
with
a
mild
grain
astringency
smooth
and
drinkable
despite
lacking
aromas
or
a
particulary
strong
appearance
nice
thats
all
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
toasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
slightly
fruity
yeast
aroma
there
is
some
malty
sweetness
but
nothing
too
intense
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
light
malty
flavor
that
rich
with
english
style
yeast
esters
it
has
some
crystal
malts
in
it
but
not
enough
to
create
a
real
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
brew
but
it
fell
way
short
its
one
and
done
for
me
750
ml
bottle
color
of
dark
brownish
red
with
a
off
white
color
head
nose
of
malt
milk
chocolate
coco
dried
bananas
and
light
hint
of
hops

taste
of
milk
chocolate
and
malt

body
is
creamy
light
to
medium
feel
and
low
carbonation

aftertaste
of
coco
milk
chocolate
and
creamy
on
a
side
note
this
is
a
very
cool
bottle
a
bit
expensive
also
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
with
the
price
i
probably
wont
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
cream
off
white
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
too
long
smelled
like
sweet
and
roasted
malts
stronger
aroma
than
other
major
european
dark
lagers
or
were
the
others
just
old
sweetish
bready
malt
balanced
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
cloying
a
good
solid
example
of
the
style
but
at
5
99
for
a
25
4oz
bottle
the
brewer
importers
and
distributors
need
to
rethink
their
sales
strategy
not
enough
people
are
going
to
bite
mine
was
free
i
would
never
have
tried
it
otherwise
pours
a
very
pretty
redtinged
brown
with
a
tight
soft
head
that
raises
up
frothily
somewhat
weak
aroma
that
never
quite
gets
going
although
it
does
have
some
nicely
soft
caramel
and
doughy
aromas
on
the
palate
theres
a
nice
mixing
of
sweet
and
dry
elements
with
sweetness
coming
through
first
and
before
the
midpalate
dries
out
just
a
touch
of
raisiny
fruits
are
present
a
flash
of
acidity
cleans
the
palate
just
before
the
finish
which
is
quick
and
not
terribly
flavorful
the
character
of
this
beer
disappears
from
the
palate
in
an
instant
mouthfeel
is
mixed
with
good
lager
smoothness
but
too
little
in
the
way
of
carbonation
it
makes
the
beer
feel
a
bit
too
heavy
than
it
should
overall
this
is
a
decent
dunkel
but
nothing
to
shout
about
second
of
the
jacobson
line
made
by
carlsberg
that
i
have
tried
this
poured
into
a
pilsner
style
glass
a
light
brown
near
copper
color
with
a
nice
large
blooming
almond
colored
head
a
nice
bit
of
carbonation
even
almost
spritzey
looking
milder
aromas
but
pleasant
a
touch
of
cocoa
and
lighlty
roasted
nut
with
a
hint
of
herbwell
rounded
subtle
flavors
hard
toffee
really
showed
out
most
to
me
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
but
the
sweetness
level
was
quite
lowa
nice
creamy
feel
was
lush
feeling
and
really
made
the
beer
enjoyable
i
had
it
with
prime
rib
and
it
held
up
well
the
touch
of
roastiness
and
sweentess
cut
thru
the
fat
wella
very
fine
dark
lager
subtle
but
not
bland
by
any
meansrecommended
notes
not
one
to
blow
you
away
nor
is
it
designed
to
be
big
this
is
an
easy
drinker
with
an
interesting
and
nicely
balanced
flavor
well
color
me
intrigued
this
jacobsen
line
from
carlsberg
has
my
full
attention
jacobsen
the
inhouse
micro
brewery
of
carlsberg
seems
to
take
classic
styles
and
give
it
a
little
extra
development
this
one
wasnt
as
adventurous
as
the
others
but
still
a
dark
lager
with
notes
of
matured
winte
is
still
interesting
not
bad
not
my
kind
of
style
beer
but
a
pretty
good
lager
it
gee
on
me
and
went
for
a
2nd
one
3
365
now
if
only
i
had
some
tacos
to
drink
this
with
i
thought
this
was
an
8
pack
beer
pours
brown
from
the
bottle
with
a
hint
of
red
a
little
bit
of
a
mocha
head
that
leaves
after
a
bit
the
aroma
is
fairly
straightforward
bready
malts
some
toffee
and
molasses
it
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
brown
bread
molasses
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
medium
mouth
this
tastes
exactly
like
a
dunkel
should
taste
its
wellmade
and
very
enjoyable
nice
roasty
semisweet
smell
with
a
kiss
of
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
dark
delicious
taste
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
pleasant
effervesence
o
a
nice
local
dark
dunkel
that
is
well
made
and
pleasant
to
drink
the
taste
brings
out
a
more
sweeter
dark
malt
character
than
the
noses
suggests
very
thin
bitterness
maybe
the
age
of
this
bottle
tainted
my
review
love
this
beer
the
chocolate
rolls
down
your
tongue
down
your
thoart
taste
wonderful
very
enjoy
beer
a
very
good
dark
larger
smooth
sexy
wow
sit
on
the
porch
and
enjoy
yum
a
no
nonsense
beer
that
you
will
enjoy
looks
good
in
a
glass
on
sip
two
sip
last
sip
still
taste
the
chocolate
its
good
what
more
can
i
say
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
color
with
good
clarity
slight
off
white
head
forms
and
has
good
retention
nutty
aroma
with
hints
of
bread
and
cocoa
just
a
whiff
of
herbal
hops
the
taste
has
more
nutty
and
cocoa
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
sweet
and
doughy
a
bit
of
caramel
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
average
american
dunkel
lager
overall
it
doesnt
try
to
hard
doesnt
want
to
impress
in
that
sense
it
does
impress
it
doesnt
try
to
hard
for
something
its
not
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
simple
mans
beer
but
its
a
dark
beer
for
people
that
usually
dont
enjoy
dark
beers
the
beer
has
a
cola
body
with
hints
of
ruby
a
quarter
inch
of
beige
head
quickly
fades
the
aroma
offers
bittersweet
chocolates
light
coffee
brown
bread
malt
ok
flavor
mild
sweetness
with
moderate
carbonation
middle
of
the
road
a
tad
spicy
with
lurking
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
give
the
feel
any
bite
body
is
squared
up
ahhh
very
good
in
the
mouth
this
feels
like
a
really
light
beer
but
it
is
packed
full
of
flavor
sweet
upfront
but
it
doesnt
linger
almost
a
root
beer
like
flavor
but
without
the
carbonation
which
is
contrary
to
all
the
bubbles
i
see
chocolate
honey
malt
all
this
yet
it
sits
lightly
and
not
weighty
like
a
doppelbock
might
it
would
be
easy
to
tip
back
a
few
of
these
easy
drinking
solid
dark
lager
oi
was
rather
impressed
as
i
envisioned
a
more
bitter
beer
i
love
lakefronts
red
and
this
is
another
winner
will
definitely
buy
again
this
would
pair
well
with
hamburgers
i
think
or
even
do
by
itself
bottoms
up
o
it
is
a
tasty
lager
i
enjoy
the
cocoa
and
caramel
flavors
it
is
probably
the
best
domestic
dark
lager
that
i
have
tried
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
could
likely
drink
several
of
in
one
sitting
o
flavors
from
a
darker
beer
in
a
relatively
light
and
drinkable
beer
not
as
complex
or
flavorful
as
a
porter
but
would
enjoy
this
as
a
session
beer
o
another
smooth
and
outrageously
drinkable
lager
from
lakefront
eastside
dark
is
as
the
name
suggests
dark
but
its
bready
chocolatey
malt
profile
has
an
almost
creamy
feel
that
finishes
with
a
nice
lager
cleanliness
flavorful
but
not
heavy
pours
pale
hazy
cloudy
yellow
with
high
white
fizzy
foam
orange
peel
nose
a
little
soapy
coriander
fizzy
taste
sneaky
orange
citrus
quick
finish
chalky
effervescent
soda
like
carbonation
and
a
bubbly
finish
odd
nicely
done
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
very
dark
red
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
with
fruit
notes
especially
berries
tastes
of
chocolate
and
very
slight
fruit
nice
combination
beer
is
slightly
heavily
carbonated
medium
bodied
finishes
nice
overall
a
very
good
beer
pours
brown
in
color
with
copper
edges
much
of
the
finger
of
beige
head
dissipated
quickly
leaving
only
a
film
of
foam
floating
on
top
of
the
liquid
the
nose
is
reminiscent
of
dark
rye
bread
malt
is
prominent
in
the
flavor
profile
and
the
finish
is
dry
with
an
ever
so
slightly
hop
bitterness
coming
through
this
offering
is
hearty
and
tasty
for
sure
the
rest
not
bad
it
has
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
but
is
strangely
watery
in
the
middle
beats
a
bud
light
pretty
good
beer
to
stumble
across
but
i
would
only
want
a
couple
before
moving
on
overall
this
is
excellent
lakefront
lagers
are
wonderful
and
this
is
no
different
overall
this
is
a
great
munich
dunkel
presenting
a
complex
malt
flavor
ruby
brown
like
a
good
fancy
pen
ink
fine
head
and
lacing
decent
smell
mainly
straightforward
malt
the
malt
flavor
is
delicious
though
even
if
it
is
just
straightforward
stuff
the
slight
sweetness
and
the
carbonation
are
big
pluses
for
me
feels
extra
pleasant
in
the
mouth
and
after
no
sting
if
thats
what
you
like
youll
get
it
here
any
beer
that
is
perfectly
pleasant
to
drink
gets
high
points
from
me
this
may
not
be
a
brew
with
too
much
fancy
complexity
but
it
is
perfectly
pleasant
id
buy
a
twelve
pack
or
a
case
in
a
heartbeat
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
hit
all
the
characteristics
that
youd
expect
from
a
dark
lager
i
wouldnt
buy
again
but
id
recommend
to
a
friend
who
likes
the
style
hops
mt
hood
a
tasty
dark
germanstyle
lager
and
where
better
stateside
than
wisconsin
to
deliver
that
to
us
i
wont
bore
everyone
with
the
obvious
canadian
alternatives
so
lets
just
say
that
i
wouldnt
mind
a
few
more
rounds
of
this
if
i
were
planted
at
some
spartan
pub
table
eating
salty
fatty
snacks
back
to
you
america
and
thinking
of
breaking
into
songs
in
support
of
country
or
college
football
team
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
bread
and
caramel
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
it
has
a
better
smell
than
taste
o
its
a
nice
beer
though
i
think
it
could
have
gone
darker
and
more
bitter
i
would
love
to
try
this
with
a
bit
of
a
rye
kick
i
enjoyed
this
nothing
overly
complicated
but
clean
and
fairly
bold
for
the
style
tasty
stuff
cheers
nutty
and
cocoa
malt
a
pinch
of
raisin
some
lactic
sourness
that
is
a
bit
overwhelming
then
chicory
bitterness
and
more
sweet
cocoa
on
the
finish
not
all
of
the
flavor
notes
are
where
i
would
want
them
to
be
but
overall
its
a
satisfying
beer
that
drinks
well
nicely
complex
and
bold
for
the
style
o
great
color
to
this
beer
i
thought
that
malt
character
was
wonderfully
complex
with
a
cleanrefreshing
finish
that
forms
an
overall
satisfying
brew
o
overall
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
well
worth
trying
by
anyone
who
likes
dark
beers
but
i
still
cant
call
it
a
good
dunkel
with
the
roasted
malts
being
so
prominent
overall
this
is
a
really
good
drinking
dark
german
brew
but
i
cant
help
but
wonder
what
i
am
smelling
what
hops
are
used
for
this
i
would
buy
it
again
however
d
excellent
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
pours
a
deep
brown
with
quickly
dissapating
head
roasty
malt
nose
with
some
earth
tones
and
chocolate
taste
has
some
toffee
dark
fruit
and
a
fair
amount
of
spicy
hops
nice
snappy
dry
finish
well
carbonated
this
one
actually
exceeded
expectations
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
somewhat
offered
it
not
a
bad
little
beer
but
i
probably
will
not
seek
it
out
again
yet
another
underwhelming
beer
out
of
my
mixed
8
pack
i
cant
see
myself
buying
it
again
not
that
their
bad
beers
but
ive
yet
to
be
truly
impressed
for
the
cost
liking
this
one
as
it
combines
a
strong
burnt
malt
smoky
flavour
with
a
very
drinkable
finish
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
and
the
beer
has
a
complexity
to
the
taste
that
often
dark
lagers
lack
would
like
to
try
this
again
but
sadly
it
only
comes
in
the
8
pack
in
bc
light
body
410
somewhat
complex
and
easy
to
drink
easily
a
session
beer
had
4
of
these
the
other
night
was
feelin
damn
good
if
i
recall
correctly
was
7
99
for
a
6pack
at
total
wine
more
good
deal
looking
forward
to
more
lakefront
stuff
it
is
a
nice
balance
of
hoppy
and
malty
with
the
emphasis
on
malty
overall
it
is
a
nice
experience
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
for
repeat
tasting
overall
an
average
beer
lacks
a
little
crispness
not
sure
if
i
would
run
to
the
store
to
buy
solid
nothing
special
this
is
one
of
the
last
of
the
lakefront
regular
lineup
for
me
to
try
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
theres
some
really
outstanding
toasted
malt
flavor
in
this
onegreat
smokiness
and
touches
of
coffee
and
chocolate
throughout
i
think
i
was
hoping
for
a
heavier
mouthfeel
but
it
works
just
fine
the
way
it
is
due
to
the
richness
of
the
flavors
i
would
probably
drink
this
one
more
like
a
dessert
beer
but
it
could
certainly
be
more
versatile
than
that
ill
definitely
be
revisiting
this
one
o
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
o
a
nice
dark
lager
the
carbonation
dominates
too
much
of
what
is
happening
in
the
mouth
taste
and
feel
and
is
a
distraction
other
than
that
true
to
form
eric
o
itll
bet
this
beer
is
better
if
paired
with
food
i
like
it
although
i
prefer
beers
that
are
a
little
less
bitter
and
a
little
less
pungent
and
roasted
in
the
background
especially
beer
of
a
style
thats
germanbavarian
in
nature
overall
a
tasty
beverage
but
lightly
off
scents
and
a
bit
too
much
malt
sweetness
on
the
tongue
make
me
relate
it
to
a
brown
ale
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
a
very
solid
dunkel
that
is
very
drinkable
first
had
this
brew
during
summerfest
a
couple
years
ago
and
it
seemed
pretty
tasty
then
had
to
revisit
to
make
sure
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
garnet
topped
by
a
short
finger
of
dusty
ecru
foam
the
nose
simply
comprises
dark
wheat
and
very
light
roasted
malts
a
dusting
of
coffee
lurks
in
the
distance
but
doesnt
seem
to
pose
much
of
a
threat
to
the
other
elements
the
taste
rounds
the
nasal
elements
out
a
bit
bringing
in
some
mild
cocoa
and
light
grass
to
the
dark
wheatlight
roast
party
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
lil
brew
nothing
spectacular
but
enjoyably
drinkable
nonetheless
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
a
good
one
pours
a
dark
amber
pour
with
medium
white
head
aroma
is
very
very
faint
i
got
picked
up
by
the
nice
light
smokey
taste
of
coffee
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
mild
spice
and
nuttiness
feels
somewhat
unbalanced
but
overall
a
good
dunkel
lager
true
to
style
nice
mellow
feel
with
a
smooth
bit
of
oiliness
but
blended
in
with
a
solid
carbonated
crispness
this
is
a
good
bier
either
this
beer
is
slightly
infected
or
maybe
its
actually
a
year
or
hell
2
old
and
has
gone
bad
d
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
especially
since
its
not
filling
it
is
quite
sessionable
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
worthy
example
of
a
germanstyle
dark
lager
flavorful
and
refreshing
without
being
too
filling
eastside
dark
is
a
treat
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
as
the
scent
of
malts
tickle
your
nose
has
a
short
lived
head
on
it
though
it
has
a
semiheavy
nutty
taste
to
it
mixed
with
what
tastes
to
be
a
few
spices
only
complaint
here
is
that
it
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
to
it
overall
a
stellar
way
to
end
the
variety
pack
i
can
see
enjoying
this
one
again
soon
during
a
football
game
the
balance
and
light
body
are
what
sell
me
on
this
variation
of
the
style
it
is
not
as
robust
as
it
could
be
but
i
think
that
is
one
of
this
beers
strengths
the
mouth
had
a
creamy
feel
to
it
and
a
licorice
after
taste
man
not
a
fan
of
licorice
maybe
im
picking
up
on
a
flavor
that
is
not
there
but
thats
how
my
tongue
interprets
it
a
nice
milwaukee
dark
lager
in
the
fashion
of
the
dunkel
lighter
then
expected
considering
its
color
i
would
buy
again
cheers
small
degrees
of
milky
cream
downward
not
a
heavy
beer
thin
in
a
good
way
light
smoke
peat
feel
as
well
light
carbonation
to
allow
you
to
pick
up
on
some
of
these
nuances
a
cool
beer
for
a
cool
milwaukee
evening
or
day
pretty
good
drinks
very
easy
d
not
a
bad
beer
from
lakefront
this
one
can
be
enjoyed
at
any
time
of
the
year
quite
nice
drinking
a
fresh
lager
beer
that
was
bottled
less
than
two
weeks
ago
sometime
during
the
first
week
of
august
this
is
easily
drinkable
and
worth
having
i
suppose
it
would
make
a
perfectly
reasonable
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
fairly
complex
lager
with
some
nice
roasted
and
dark
flavors
that
manages
to
still
be
light
enough
to
be
easy
drinking
it
is
malt
focused
yet
not
too
sweet
at
all
black
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
faint
chocolate
taste
caramelchocolate
and
a
little
coffee
overall
a
decent
beer
that
goes
down
relatively
smmooth
this
is
something
you
can
drink
in
any
season
im
pretty
sure
that
i
would
buy
again
and
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
d
really
good
beer
but
nothing
to
really
seek
out
than
most
dunkel
style
lagers
i
have
tried
very
drinkable
though
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
too
much
carbonation
huge
foamy
offwhite
head
with
tons
of
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
bready
with
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
bready
with
lots
of
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
i
was
expecting
alot
more
from
this
brew
disappointted
still
the
beer
fares
quite
well
just
gotta
like
the
toast
character
here
its
probably
what
michelobs
amber
bock
wants
to
be
when
it
grows
up
an
enjoyable
wellbalanced
dark
lager
a
touch
of
roast
hops
and
a
mild
sour
touch
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet
while
keeping
it
maltforward
easytodrink
nice
the
body
is
thinner
than
i
would
like
as
well
some
mild
carbonation
on
the
tongue
but
its
just
lacking
in
depth
sweet
brown
sugar
right
away
in
flavor
some
toasted
breads
in
the
middle
and
a
slightly
sour
syrupy
back
end
this
was
alright
but
ive
had
much
better
of
the
style
and
much
better
from
the
brewery
probably
my
least
favorite
of
theirs
so
far
d
a
solid
beer
that
might
be
a
bit
richer
than
what
the
style
typically
is
but
it
is
welcomed
a
great
alternative
for
the
brown
ale
enthusiast
looking
for
something
new
or
different
one
of
lakefronts
best
in
my
opinion
overall
i
like
east
side
dark
and
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
friends
however
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
too
light
it
needs
to
be
boosted
given
a
shot
of
flavor
and
character
at
the
end
of
the
day
people
will
remember
that
they
drank
a
good
beer
but
will
not
remember
the
name
lakefront
is
an
amazing
brewery
but
i
think
they
held
back
on
this
one
a
bit
d
overall
well
balanced
with
good
carbonation
very
light
and
drinkable
for
a
darker
beer
i
will
have
to
find
and
try
more
beers
like
this
one
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
a
style
that
one
does
not
see
at
not
least
a
lot
around
here
a
good
beer
that
i
would
pick
up
again
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
this
beer
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
a
2
inch
beige
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
chocolate
syrup
cola
and
just
a
bit
of
toast
no
hop
presence
honestly
the
flavor
is
almost
exactly
the
same
light
chocolate
uncarbonated
coca
cola
toast
with
just
a
light
medicinal
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
light
carbonation
wow
i
think
this
is
the
shortest
review
ive
wrote
in
a
while
but
there
really
wasnt
much
to
say
about
it
really
mediocre
it
has
been
difficult
for
me
to
find
a
bad
year
round
beer
from
lakefront
and
this
is
no
exception
no
creeping
imperialism
here
just
a
nicely
done
dunkel
worth
a
try
by
all
overall
this
certainly
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
one
ill
look
for
again
flavor
is
similar
grainy
and
simple
slightly
astringent
with
a
mild
nuttiness
something
mildy
medicinal
about
it
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
no
trace
of
hops
whatsoever
not
as
crisp
as
a
true
german
munich
dunkel
body
is
light
and
fairly
easy
drinking
overall
its
passable
but
riverwest
stein
is
much
better
d
starts
good
but
the
finish
lacks
anything
memorable
good
dunkel
though
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
and
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
d
this
is
pretty
good
brew
it
was
tasty
and
easy
drinking
the
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
sourness
in
my
opinion
in
fact
i
could
see
this
being
a
very
good
beer
without
that
lactic
twang
because
i
do
like
the
malt
bill
however
with
it
i
was
looking
forward
to
finishing
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
slightly
tanned
head
nose
is
roasted
grain
with
some
citrus
hop
zing
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
twang
is
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
a
nice
mixture
of
caramel
and
sweet
malt
in
the
front
with
some
metallic
notes
jumbled
around
with
the
faint
hop
bitterness
it
all
gets
wrapped
up
in
a
crisp
finish
little
bit
of
buttery
notes
in
the
lingering
aftertaste
it
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carb
despite
the
minor
metallic
twang
i
am
finding
this
beverage
rather
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
decent
beer
from
lakefront
im
not
sure
anything
will
ever
supplant
riverwest
stein
as
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
suitable
stand
in
overall
most
lakefront
beers
have
been
kinda
boring
all
solid
beers
dont
get
me
wrong
but
mainly
classic
styles
with
classic
interpretation
the
same
holds
true
with
this
one
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smeel
is
mild
some
notes
of
malts
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
malty
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
stronger
than
expected
carbonation
given
the
lack
of
head
drinkability
is
limited
just
because
it
simply
isnt
very
good
this
beer
didnt
seem
anything
like
the
style
to
me
like
whatsoever
besides
color
i
enjoyed
it
though
so
i
gave
it
a
good
review
d
very
sessionable
best
one
of
this
style
ive
had
a
long
time
through
all
that
weird
yeast
flavor
there
is
a
touch
of
roasted
barley
the
finish
is
astringent
the
body
is
watery
hopefully
a
bad
bottle
but
i
wont
assume
it
since
i
bought
the
last
sampler
pack
and
they
dont
carry
this
separately
it
will
be
some
time
before
i
can
retest
deep
cola
brown
appearance
much
darker
than
the
current
penn
dark
being
brewed
at
the
lion
head
is
light
beige
lacing
is
even
but
scant
aroma
has
a
tartness
working
its
magic
amongst
the
darker
malts
cocoa
powder
and
coffee
roasts
in
the
forefront
with
mineral
water
yeast
nuttiness
that
appears
in
most
of
the
beers
ive
had
from
them
herbal
tea
leaf
notes
in
the
finish
with
an
air
of
smokiness
complex
light
beer
i
like
it
flavor
has
a
fruit
sweetness
under
the
light
coffee
and
roasted
milk
chocolate
layers
along
with
more
of
a
slightly
lactic
mineral
quality
that
just
works
in
a
dunkel
hell
this
is
better
than
hofbrauhaus
pittsurghs
dunkel
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
really
a
dry
roasty
finish
going
with
tartness
lingering
on
the
sides
of
my
palate
drinkability
overall
is
pretty
effin
good
one
of
those
effortless
beers
that
i
would
probably
imbibe
on
while
visiting
the
brewery
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
dunkel
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
d
not
a
bad
showing
from
lakefront
i
am
not
sure
what
i
have
had
in
the
past
from
this
midwest
brewery
but
this
brew
ranks
in
the
upper
tier
i
would
have
this
again
big
tan
head
on
a
dark
brown
body
the
taste
is
kind
of
like
a
dry
stout
roasty
with
some
nice
molasses
sweetness
seems
a
little
watery
to
me
though
a
bigger
malt
presence
and
more
carbonation
would
have
been
nice
roastiness
and
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
aroma
is
strong
malty
and
yeasty
with
just
a
touch
of
cinnamon
it
pours
a
somewhat
transparent
amberbrown
with
a
thick
and
fairly
persistent
tan
head
quite
appetizing
flavor
is
malty
and
hast
a
subtle
undertone
of
molasses
texture
is
smooth
a
little
fizzy
and
just
a
tad
thin
this
beers
only
weak
point
overall
a
worthy
brew
the
feel
is
bubbly
with
some
retention
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
milky
its
a
solid
dark
beverage
malty
and
rich
the
roasted
malt
and
cola
flavors
dominate
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
lighter
tan
colors
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
yeast
cleanliness
and
slight
grass
aroma
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
dunkel
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
up
front
then
some
roasted
malt
yeast
cleanliness
hints
of
pale
hops
and
some
grass
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
very
effervescent
medium
body
extremely
drinkable
d
a
really
nice
munich
dunkel
lager
nothing
overly
complex
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
coppery
edge
and
a
small
head
with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
fairly
thin
though
it
has
good
smoky
chocolatey
notes
of
dark
malt
the
flavor
is
rich
and
roasty
but
sadly
thin
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
some
carbonation
that
brings
up
the
roasted
malt
flavor
overall
a
good
beer
and
would
have
again
any
time
of
all
the
darks
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
reminds
me
of
berghoff
dark
but
with
a
better
aroma
and
mouthfeel
to
it
it
was
a
simple
dark
nothing
that
really
hit
you
but
still
nice
and
smooth
all
in
all
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
most
likely
buy
it
again
d
nice
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
if
it
were
in
my
area
i
poured
this
new
beer
for
me
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
dark
as
it
should
be
it
poured
a
tan
bubbly
head
with
tiny
bubbles
lacing
was
only
fair
the
taste
starts
sweet
chocolaty
and
malty
and
finishes
a
little
bitter
but
not
too
bitter
i
liked
it
and
will
buy
again
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
alot
to
offer
i
drank
it
after
dinner
and
it
went
down
quite
smooth
would
drink
again
d
very
good
tasty
and
satisfying
and
easy
to
drink
and
no
alcohol
flavor
excellent
example
of
this
style
best
beer
in
the
sampler
hands
down
thanks
to
my
friends
at
fsri
for
the
2nd
installment
of
my
beer
of
the
month
club
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
bottled
during
the
3rd
week
of
january
notched
on
the
bottle
poured
cola
brown
with
maroon
highlights
when
backlit
one
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
slowly
recedes
leaving
generous
strands
of
lacing
in
its
wake
mild
nose
earthy
lactic
acid
perhaps
some
cocoa
taste
is
difficult
to
describe
earthy
and
vegetal
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
goes
down
easy
but
kind
of
weird
tasting
a
medium
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
did
leave
a
ring
with
each
sip
aroma
was
weak
faint
coffee
was
the
best
i
could
smell
taste
was
better
roasted
malt
and
fresh
coffee
with
a
slight
nutty
slightly
bitter
finish
light
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
held
up
well
overall
very
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
taste
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
desent
taste
could
easly
see
myself
drinking
alot
of
theses
in
one
sitting
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
agian
if
only
i
could
find
it
around
where
i
live
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
competent
dark
lager
smells
tastes
looks
feels
very
rich
but
not
thick
it
does
seem
a
little
hmm
metallic
but
not
distractingly
so
i
might
have
to
drink
6
or
7
of
these
in
a
row
to
really
assess
the
drinkability
but
im
pretty
pleased
with
it
seems
like
a
good
flagship
beer
which
i
think
they
consider
it
if
so
its
a
great
standard
to
hold
to
i
recieved
this
as
part
of
a
beer
of
the
month
club
i
poured
it
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
is
dark
with
red
hues
when
held
up
to
a
light
there
is
moderate
head
formation
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
flavor
was
sweet
almost
nutty
without
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
finish
was
dry
and
crisp
a
light
bodied
brew
with
moderate
carbonation
it
is
highly
quaffable
imo
it
tasted
similiar
to
a
nut
brown
ale
drinkability
take
it
or
leave
it
i
was
hoping
for
more
toasted
bread
qualities
but
it
kept
giving
me
nuts
its
shruginducingly
acceptable
but
when
shopping
for
a
dunkel
i
prefer
ayingers
altbairisch
dunkel
thats
just
me
though
not
bad
a
bit
sweet
for
a
session
but
ill
give
it
shot
tomorrow
beforeduring
the
game
pours
a
cloudy
amber
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
not
much
retention
but
decent
laceing
aroma
is
of
fruit
and
sweet
malts
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
nice
tart
finish
some
honey
notes
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
brew
d
decent
pretty
average
beer
i
would
say
that
this
was
a
good
chocolate
nutty
lager
im
a
fan
of
this
brewery
and
this
beer
was
certainly
solid
pretty
presentation
nice
fluffy
head
beautiful
brown
color
and
texture
aroma
of
dark
fruits
cherries
but
in
a
bit
offputting
way
follows
through
with
the
flavor
more
sucrets
than
fruit
perhaps
i
dont
dislike
it
its
actually
decent
enough
but
just
a
bit
odd
for
me
the
taste
is
similar
mostly
fresh
moist
wholewheat
bread
hints
of
earth
and
pine
very
light
hints
of
caramel
herbs
and
chocolate
its
zesty
but
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
yet
complex
and
full
of
flavour
drinkability
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
for
me
and
spot
on
as
far
as
the
ba
and
bjcp
style
guidelines
go
alcohol
is
low
and
undetectable
making
this
one
very
sessionabledrinkable
though
its
not
the
most
interesting
beer
in
the
world
its
solid
and
worth
a
recommendation
i
just
cant
get
past
the
wierd
sourness
it
ruins
what
could
have
been
a
decent
beer
for
me
not
bad
strong
cocoa
and
earthy
notes
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
drinkability
superb
session
beer
here
one
of
my
favorites
from
lakefront
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
scent
with
not
much
else
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
its
dry
and
roasted
with
little
complexity
it
tastes
like
a
lagered
nut
brown
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
although
this
is
a
pretty
different
dunkel
than
im
used
to
drinking
dgood
session
brew
probably
my
favorite
thus
far
from
this
brewery
md
im
sitting
here
thinking
about
changing
the
ratings
a
bit
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
can
be
a
session
beer
no
doubt
but
i
am
swinging
back
and
forth
about
whether
i
just
plain
like
the
beer
or
really
love
this
stuff
this
is
what
i
think
michelob
or
a
top
line
version
of
miller
should
be
at
any
rate
i
am
digging
it
taste
is
mostly
roasted
malt
more
syrupy
than
i
expected
good
amount
of
carbonation
slight
dry
chocolate
taste
with
a
little
chocolate
bitterness
notes
you
could
have
this
one
during
the
summer
and
although
not
too
complex
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
i
will
try
this
again
as
i
like
dark
beers
nice
flavorgood
balance
not
world
classbut
worthy
of
a
purchase
12oz
brown
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
as
part
of
this
brewerys
sampler
8pack
pours
dark
brown
with
rubyred
highlights
and
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
head
smells
like
chocolate
caramel
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
tastes
chocolatey
and
nutty
with
smoke
and
fruit
notes
on
the
finish
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
helps
make
this
dunkel
even
more
drinkable
very
tasty
a
really
solid
dunkel
dont
drink
and
review
pours
a
cola
like
dark
brown
color
with
an
average
head
that
settled
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
stale
coffee
i
dont
pick
up
much
of
the
doughybready
characteristics
of
the
munich
style
the
brew
has
a
nice
mocha
like
taste
with
a
touch
of
the
munich
malt
characteristics
that
i
mentioned
was
lacking
in
the
aroma
the
feel
is
light
and
watery
and
perhaps
too
soft
on
the
carbonation
especially
for
a
lager
nice
drinkability
and
a
decent
brew
overall
nothing
spectacular
going
on
here
d
while
i
did
enjoy
it
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
still
a
solid
drinkable
beer
worthy
of
a
session
best
consumed
ontap
while
smack
dab
in
the
extraordinary
cultural
mecca
known
as
milwaukees
east
side
definitely
a
tasty
lager
that
i
would
look
for
again
d
easily
drinkable
there
are
enough
dark
flavors
here
to
keep
you
interested
and
the
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
is
well
maintained
the
only
flaw
i
can
find
is
a
slight
overcarbonation
that
gives
the
beer
some
undesirable
soda
like
qualities
in
the
finish
d
extremely
drinkable
dark
lager
with
good
amount
of
flavor
better
than
i
had
anticipated
quite
sweet
and
pretty
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
also
very
flavorful
poured
a
deep
dark
amberbrown
head
appears
then
fades
quickly
aroma
is
somewhat
lacking
some
graininess
some
chocolate
faint
hop
decent
sweet
malty
taste
dark
malt
bite
is
minimal
toffee
or
carmel
peep
out
this
beer
company
would
not
survive
in
wa
state
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
a
bit
earthy
the
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
coffee
notes
it
has
a
big
well
balanced
flavor
it
is
full
bodied
i
bought
this
in
a
mixed
box
not
thinking
much
about
it
but
im
impressed
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
overall
a
decent
lager
not
as
smooth
as
the
typical
dunkel
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
tan
head
nose
is
so
minimally
earthy
and
leafy
that
it
is
almost
nonexistent
flavor
is
earthy
and
leafy
with
a
bitter
tang
to
it
feel
has
a
decent
bubble
and
the
liquid
is
nice
too
but
overall
this
is
a
lackluster
performance
nothing
to
run
to
the
store
to
grab
hold
of
not
exactly
tops
but
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
nevertheless
d
ok
not
an
overly
great
beer
but
solid
if
it
came
down
to
this
or
bmcs
theres
no
thought
needed
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
lacing
on
top
there
is
suprisingly
little
aroma
the
taste
is
the
best
of
this
beer
it
is
very
think
for
dark
beer
without
much
consistancy
but
it
is
drinkable
overall
worth
a
shot
this
beer
is
one
of
lakefronts
best
it
fits
with
there
style
pours
a
brownish
red
color
topped
by
a
good
finger
of
creamy
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
aroma
of
sweet
munich
and
dark
malts
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
palate
is
mildly
sweet
up
front
before
the
balance
of
fairly
assertive
fruity
hops
sets
in
the
body
is
pleasantly
creamy
yet
can
be
a
bit
foamy
if
youre
not
careful
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
to
handle
at
times
a
decent
offering
d
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
my
favorite
lakefront
brew
im
always
happy
to
indulge
in
an
eastsider
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
lighter
brew
that
contains
a
great
balance
of
flavors
yet
doesnt
feel
heavy
in
the
mouth
or
stomach
cheers
a
pleasnt
beer
nothing
great
yet
still
enjoyable
this
is
like
a
great
brown
ale
although
its
a
lager
a
nice
round
flavor
finish
is
clean
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
just
shy
of
full
body
as
with
other
oddly
driedmalt
brews
gets
a
little
old
i
can
easily
finish
a
bottle
no
need
for
another
this
beer
is
solidly
drinkable
and
one
i
would
enjoy
sessioning
definitely
recommended
cheers
o
this
is
a
damn
solid
brew
while
certainly
not
anything
groundbreaking
its
flavors
are
complex
and
balanced
all
the
while
this
remains
an
excessively
approachable
beer
both
to
session
and
to
mix
with
a
wide
variety
of
pretty
common
foods
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
brewery
era
tasty
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
brown
color
with
mohogany
highlights
and
a
thin
creamy
offwhite
head
the
smell
seems
slightly
complex
chocolate
roasted
malts
toasted
biscuits
and
a
slight
fruity
aroma
beer
is
well
balanced
with
hops
almost
to
the
point
of
being
slightly
more
than
i
would
expect
for
the
style
the
hops
are
grassy
and
earthy
the
malt
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
there
is
also
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
the
beer
is
pretty
light
in
body
with
creamy
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
a
pretty
tasty
lager
it
is
very
good
and
drinkable
this
is
a
full
bodied
lager
with
a
pleasant
mouth
coat
and
a
low
to
moderated
degree

maltiness
white

kind
of
a
lighter
woody
amberish
color
with
a
sparse
lightly
tan
head
that
fades
doesnt
look
too
appetizing
smells
really
nutty
really
sweet
with
caramel
notes
as
well
first
sip
delivers
a
rich
smooth
flavor
one
expects
but
often
doesnt
find
in
a
dunkel
a
touch
of
roasted
hazelnut
flavor
is
there
some
semisweet
chocolate
flavors
come
around
underneath
the
nuttyness
a
touch
herbal
and
acidic
fruitiness
in
the
back
actually
has
more
carbonation
and
liveliness
on
the
palate
than
appearance
would
suggest
better
than
most
dunkels
flavorful
and
drinkable
eastside
dark
is
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
lakefront
lineup
it
adheres
to
the
dunkel
lager
guidelinesas
i
understand
themand
manages
to
pack
a
considerable
amount
of
flavor
and
a
respectable
amount
of
depth
into
a
relatively
light
style
id
consider
buying
this
one
in
sixers
on
those
rare
occasions
when
i
crave
a
wellrounded
easy
drinking
dark
beer
drinkability
not
sure
of
the
abv
on
this
one
but
with
low
bitterness
and
average
carbonation
i
could
stand
to
have
a
few
of
these
nothing
over
the
top
as
far
as
complexity
but
maybe
a
good
session
beer
i
first
had
the
eastside
dark
at
one
of
my
favorite
pizza
places
in
the
city
last
summer
now
whenever
i
am
in
the
city
i
will
make
it
a
point
to
pick
some
up
as
i
poured
the
beer
into
my
pint
glass
i
could
already
smell
very
strong
notes
of
coffee
and
heavy
barley
malts
the
beer
poured
out
into
a
nice
deep
chestnut
mahogany
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
after
a
minute
or
so
leaving
a
wispy
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
the
beer
smelled
of
toasted
barley
coffee
rich
chocolate
malts
comparable
to
the
scent
of
a
freshly
baked
loaf
of
wholegrain
bread
the
first
drink
had
a
nice
balance
of
strong
bittering
hops
roasted
malts
and
coffee
after
a
few
drinks
i
noticed
that
the
beer
became
a
little
acidic
but
the
acidity
subsided
further
down
the
glass
all
in
all
the
brew
was
a
very
smooth
elixir
of
toasted
grain
roasted
malts
mixed
nuts
and
freshly
baked
dark
bread
the
tastes
reflect
the
nose
perfectly
the
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
stays
that
way
through
the
whole
glass
the
most
notable
feature
of
this
brew
was
the
surprisingly
smooth
aftertaste
usually
dark
lagers
have
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
this
one
was
surprisingly
sweet
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
is
rather
filling
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
overall
a
good
example
of
a
munich
dark
without
going
over
the
top
pours
dark
amber
in
color
almost
opaque
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
after
a
a
couple
of
minutes
leaving
a
ring
of
lace
and
a
few
archipelagoes
theres
a
tangy
sour
quality
to
the
nose
which
might
lead
one
to
think
of
an
infected
yeast
strain
but
ive
tasted
this
beer
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
this
quality
has
remained
consistent
sweet
and
tangy
on
the
first
sip
the
tanginess
coming
from
a
collusion
of
malt
and
hops
smooth
on
the
palate
and
the
sweet
tangy
interplay
makes
this
beer
seem
a
bit
light
but
ultimately
quite
refreshing
the
taste
may
seem
a
bit
light
thin
from
the
way
it
pours
and
looks
but
its
onstyle
mild
hop
bitterness
throughout
is
tempered
by
a
floral
quality
present
about
midway
through
the
palate
nice
roasted
dark
malt
notes
in
here
this
was
the
one
i
went
back
for
on
several
occasions
when
i
toured
the
brewery
even
with
their
big
easy
on
tap
you
know
the
fake
mona
lisa
with
the
mustache
painted
on
this
beer
is
that
but
with
a
stinky
little
budweiser
foamscud
caterpillar
stache
it
tries
to
have
body
and
be
a
dark
being
but
if
you
rinse
the
mud
off
it
has
a
corporate
label
taste
across
its
chest
and
through
the
neck
and
away
it
goes
to
blasé
land
poor
little
penny
ante
brew
not
outstanding
but
better
than
average
poured
a
light
chestnut
head
quickly
diminished
to
a
longlasting
ring
of
lace
around
the
glass
sweet
clean
malt
flavor
wiht
less
roastedness
than
i
would
have
expected
bitterness
that
hinted
at
coffee
sharp
clean
finish
very
refreshing
one
of
the
best
stateside
interpretations
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
bravo
pours
out
to
a
light
brown
amber
color
with
a
short
lived
head
of
foam
that
drifts
away
quite
fast
lower
carbonation
and
lace
is
absent
aromas
of
roasted
medium
bodied
malts
wood
notes
saturated
grains
some
notes
of
sweet
dark
fruits
nice
taste
is
full
bodied
and
has
a
good
amount
of
complexity
and
depth
toasty
malt
wet
grain
and
cereal
earthy
woody
notes
a
touch
of
buttery
toast
sweet
fired
sugar
cane
finishs
off
this
delectable
beer
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
but
still
quaffable
a
good
level
of
drinkability
worth
trying
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brownishblack
color
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
shouts
of
caramel
but
there
is
also
roasted
malt
and
butter
the
tase
is
very
relaxing
caramel
tries
to
dominate
but
is
cut
through
by
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
i
will
certainly
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
decent
head
from
a
twelve
ounce
brown
bottle
smells
a
bit
malty
the
first
sip
was
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
unfortunately
things
went
down
hill
from
here
the
second
and
subsequent
sips
had
an
unpleasant
sour
taste
that
predominated
i
shared
this
beer
with
a
friend
who
had
to
pour
his
out
he
supplied
the
beer
and
told
me
before
we
drank
it
that
he
didnt
like
it
but
didnt
say
why
but
he
wanted
my
opinion
i
was
able
to
finish
the
half
bottle
i
had
but
it
was
not
good
apparently
the
problem
was
not
just
with
this
bottle
per
my
friend
im
not
sure
if
this
was
a
bad
batch
or
if
it
wasnt
handled
well
after
brewing
or
if
this
is
just
how
it
is
supposed
to
taste
based
on
what
i
had
i
cant
recommend
this
this
is
pretty
quaffable
would
good
alone
or
with
ribsbbq
or
dessert
dthis
is
a
nice
dark
lager
it
has
good
complexity
yet
subtle
and
the
grain
really
comes
through
the
smooth
lagering
really
makes
this
drinkable
it
would
be
nice
to
see
a
bit
more
hops
but
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
the
flavor
is
enjoyable
and
the
beer
goes
down
really
easy
i
wish
the
roasted
notes
were
a
bit
more
prominent
but
a
decent
brew
to
sit
down
with
and
enjoy
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
with
a
decent
off
white
head
and
carbonation
although
the
head
receded
very
quickly
the
nose
is
all
sweet
toffee
with
just
a
touch
of
fruit
on
the
finish
possibly
dates
the
flavor
is
sweet
toffee
caramel
and
figs
no
hop
character
at
all
reasonably
smooth
mouth
feel
ok
drinkability
if
a
dark
lager
is
your
style
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
my
cup
of
tea
though
drinkability
not
too
good
i
would
skip
this
one
d
a
decent
dark
lager
thought
i
am
admittedly
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
a
little
thin
and
not
particularly
visually
pleasing
a
drinkable
lager
but
not
high
on
my
list
to
revisit
had
this
on
tap
at
the
red
rock
cafe
on
oakland
looked
very
nice
dark
with
a
substantial
brownishwhite
head
nice
lacing
smelled
okay
initially
a
mixture
of
bananay
esters
buttery
diacetyl
and
some
olivesprunes
as
it
warmed
though
the
smell
quickly
went
downhill
taking
on
the
nose
of
a
giant
olive
the
taste
thankfully
was
not
nearly
as
bad
a
little
olivey
but
pretty
light
and
smooth
with
just
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
was
okay
but
the
beer
was
just
served
too
warm
i
think
drink
it
cold
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
no
head
upon
the
pour
smell
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
some
sourness
as
well
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
a
hint
of
chocolate
with
a
pleasant
sour
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
full
but
the
carbonation
is
lacking
overall
drinkability
is
ok
better
than
what
most
of
milwaukee
has
to
offer
per
lakefront
website
barley
malts
chocolate
black
patent
and
munich
malt
original
gravity
of
1060
mt
hood
hops
in
all
fairness
this
is
better
than
the
average
dark
lager
i
think
i
could
learn
to
appreciate
the
style
more
at
which
time
this
review
could
be
adjusted
upwardly
poured
brown
in
color
with
no
head
and
very
little
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
malts
and
the
hops
are
just
slightly
noticeable
the
came
across
as
a
little
grapefruity
the
flavor
came
across
as
very
watered
down
but
there
was
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
some
grean
christmasy
seasonal
tones
the
mouthfeel
was
flat
and
very
dissapointing
not
something
i
would
choose
again
because
it
is
overall
quite
lifeless
on
the
tongue
i
stumbled
upon
quite
an
odd
find
here
but
lucky
me
ill
have
to
revisit
this
in
the
future
as
ive
been
happy
with
the
rest
of
the
sampler
if
i
were
rating
this
as
a
dark
lager
it
would
score
horribly
but
hey
its
a
good
beer
so
ill
score
it
as
its
own
entity
im
sure
that
this
probably
a
very
good
dark
lager
as
the
aroma
was
great
for
a
style
i
generally
abhor
very
drinkable
could
be
better
on
tap
not
a
bad
brew
i
find
this
a
nice
beer
one
that
i
would
buy
again
but
not
one
that
i
would
have
to
have
too
often
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
bread
crust
toast
upfront
and
a
little
less
caramel
the
fruity
alcohol
esters
are
a
bit
misplaced
in
this
style
as
well
a
nice
and
tasty
munichstyle
dunkel
though
surpassed
by
other
examples
in
my
opinion
part
of
a
monthly
beer
of
the
month
club
selecetion
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
still
giving
it
a
chance
pours
a
very
nice
glass
with
a
foamy
head
with
lacing
that
sticks
to
the
glass
looks
almost
like
root
beer
warmer
serving
temperature
really
extracts
the
floral
aromas
creamy
frothiness
does
not
really
excite
the
mouth
can
drink
one
a
night
at
most
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
nice
ruby
hues
coming
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
toasted
sesame
seeds
to
me
the
flavor
is
not
bad
at
all
the
lager
flavors
i
dislike
are
not
very
prevalent
in
this
there
is
a
somewhat
burtn
caramel
sweetness
in
there
along
with
a
nice
roasted
character
not
a
bad
beer
the
feel
is
fairly
thin
i
would
like
a
touch
more
thickness
drinkability
is
not
bad
either
the
beer
is
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
like
it
for
a
lager
clear
dark
brown
with
obvious
ruby
influences
shiny
yet
dull
as
there
wasnt
much
animation
the
head
was
very
skimpy
it
only
reached
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
in
height
give
or
take
before
quickly
disappearing
aside
from
a
thin
collar
there
wasnt
any
subsequent
lacing
either
on
a
whole
the
appearance
is
boring
the
color
is
nice
enough
but
everything
else
yawn
the
nose
is
pleasantly
roasty
with
coffee
beans
chocolate
and
charcoal
with
just
a
trace
of
earthy
sweetness
the
nose
is
very
inviting
the
roast
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
dunkel
but
more
of
a
brown
ale
i
like
that
the
potency
is
modest
but
the
bouquet
is
very
clean
straightforward
and
articulate
i
like
that
too
the
palate
is
just
a
nice
as
the
nose
it
is
also
deadon
as
it
tastes
just
like
it
smells
the
only
difference
is
the
sweetness
is
a
tickle
louder
than
i
was
expecting
the
roast
is
the
show
though
coffee
with
a
kiss
of
milk
chocolate
and
charred
wood
there
is
a
tickle
of
earthiness
hops
dont
do
much
this
is
a
sweet
beer
that
is
balanced
by
the
roast
i
like
it
too
bad
it
is
not
a
little
more
complex
or
louder
still
im
digging
it
i
could
drink
this
everyday
the
roast
reminds
me
a
lot
of
empyrean
third
stone
brown
and
imo
that
is
a
good
thing
i
have
no
complaints
with
the
palate
it
is
very
likable
easy
to
drink
and
i
bet
this
would
go
nicely
with
many
grilled
meats
veggies
stews
chili
and
cheese
my
only
beef
with
this
beer
is
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
too
low
like
every
lakefront
beer
ive
quaffed
it
is
also
a
little
thin
a
little
slick
and
a
little
sticky
all
those
littles
add
up
to
a
problem
this
aspect
of
the
beer
could
me
much
improved
extremely
drinkable
the
abv
seems
low
too
session
beer
material
id
kick
back
and
quaff
a
few
more
any
day
of
the
week
it
was
purchased
as
part
of
a
samplerpack
in
milwaukee
wi
not
as
good
as
kostritzer
but
for
an
american
dark
very
presentable
and
enjoyable
cola
amber
brown

with
a

roasted
caramelly

and
toasted

taste
starts
off
with
lightly
sweet
malts
singed
caramel
and
molasses
followed
by
roastedtoasted

finish
is
lightly
bitter
with
lingering

medium

fairly
drinkable
a

nod
to

for
this
one
may
the
force
be
with
you

clear

dripping
ring
lace
touch
of
burnt
rasin
bread
crust
to
the
aroma
muted
but
good
very
roasty
flavor
cozy
like
morning
toast
with
some
elements
of
faint
semisweet
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
light
but
works
well
with
a
good
texture
and
the
flavors
finishes
with
a
good
and
subtle
transition
to
bare
haylike
hopping
nothing
jarring
to
the
overall
impression
this
was
a
winner
for
me
very
nice
drinking
and
good
for
the
style
and
expectations
drinkability
factor
very
high
im
not
sure
if
this
is
the
darker
version
of
the
klisch
pilsener
but
whoever
had
the
idea
for
a
good
dark
lager
got
it
right
here
very
much
in
the
munich
style
of
dark
lagers
i
really
enjoyed
this
dunkel
as
it
was
very
drinkable
and
it
had
a
good
flavor
to
it
it
poured
a
very
small
sized
lght
brown
head
that
contained
finemedium
sized
bubbles
that
mostly
diminished
the
body
was
carbonated
and
opaque
with
a
dark
brown
hue
the
nose
was
malty
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
sweet
flavor
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
which
is
much
to
my
liking
and
it
is
medium
bodied
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
with
this
beer
this
one
is
an
orangebrown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
slightly
roasted
malt
maybe
a
little
chocolate
chip
cookielike
light
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
dominate
the
light
and
refreshing
flavor
profile
the
light
body
makes
it
a
perfect
summer
quaffer
a
thorough
taste
treat
that
id
happily
consume
again
thanks
jeffboo
the

worthwhile
a
pretty
good
dark
roasted

aroma
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
bubbly
head
that
fades
to
a
small
lace
a
very
sweet
taste
with
minimal
hopping
present
definitely
a
bit
syruppy
in
the
mouth
a
nice
sweet
milk
chocolate
flavor
great
taste
just
a
bit
syruppy
ill
drink
this
one
any
day
over
say
a
becks
dark
this
beer
pours
dark
rubby
and
throws
a
medium
creamy
brown
head
that
is
gone
in
a
minute
nice
aroma
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
bean
nice
taste
theres
a
musty
burnt
malt
taste
maybe
a
little
molasses
some
chocolate
too
a
little
brown
sugar
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
nice
no
harsh
bitterness
detected
at
all
very
easy
drinking
medium
body
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
without
blinking
an
eye
cheap
but
ok
on
a
sunny
day
a
respectable
decent
tasting
brew
i
generally
find
it
offered
at
most
mexican
restaurants
and
becomes
my
goto
brew
for
such
occasions
it
offers
enough
roasted
grain
character
and
warmth
with
a
complementary
hop
bitterness
to
make
it
stand
out
over
most
commonly
offered
mexican
brewery
offerings
pours
a
darkbrown
clear
color
with
a
very
small
foamy
head
from
a
tap
head
retention
and
lacing
are
minimal
at
best
dark
malty
aroma
hints
of
nuts
and
caramel
maybe
slightly
sweet
taste
with
heavier
malts
nutty
and
slight
caramel
not
much
of
a
hoppy
bitterness
it
is
a
good
beer
to
try
if
you
are
looking
to
go
from
crap
to
craft
but
not
a
beer
craft
lovers
would
consistently
buy
maybe
as
a
cheaper
beer
to
bring
to
parties
instead
of
the
mass
produced
adjuvant
lagers
ok
not
a
winner
but
i
try
to
represent
in
every
style
as
far
as
mexican
macros
is
there
a
mexican
anything
else
sincerely
let
me
know
its
better
than
pacifico
corona
etc
be
at
the
beach
or
youll
be
disappointed
the
closer
to
light
the
redder
the
further
from
light
the
browner
transparent
for
the
color
light
graybrown
head
which
quickly
turns
to
a
film
lasts
awhile
longer
before
completely
disappearing
smell
is
nutty
and
sweet
also
it
is
just
barely
estery
judging
from
this
it
is
perhaps
a
little
old
but
still
tastes
the
same
as
always
to
me
good
very
much
of
caramel
and
malt
faintly
woody
chocolatey
alcoholic
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
black
cherry
im
serious
took
me
a
while
to
figure
out
what
it
was
mildly
bitter
throughout
well
balanced
highly
carbonated
medium
to
full
bodied
lightly
coats
the
teeth
finish
is
at
first
wet
and
then
warming
as
refreshing
as
a
pilsner
as
comforting
as
an
ale
from
the
bottle
in
a
glass
pours
a
reddishbrown
with
a
nice
head
that
lasts
smells
of
roasted
nuts
and
chocolate
tastes
sweet
and
then
bitter
in
a
good
balance
like
the
aroma
full
bodied
feel
and
slightly
bitter
going
down
overall
my
goto
beer
in
a
mexican
restaurant
its
a
great
dark
beer
nice
and
full
bodied
my
go
to
dark
beer
in
the
summer
tasted
like
a
beer
sprite
it
was
very
sweet
but
have
to
say
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
at
a
friends
home
it
was
free
and
will
drink
again
if
it
is
free
but
probably
will
never
buy
not
the
best
beer
i
have
tasted
but
it
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
smooth
and
tasty
its
far
better
than
corona
and
most
american
brews
o
after
drinking
corona
dos
equis
superior
rubia
etc
it
was
awesome
to
find
a
mexican
beer
that
didnt
taste
like
corn
andor
urine
definitely
getting
this
one
again
although
it
is
a
tad
on
the
heavier
side
and
is
quite
filling
bomb
with
some
fajitas
for
sure
sweet
flavor
with
a
dry
finish
this
bitterness
is
hidden
unless
you
go
looking
for
it
this
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
refreshing
exactly
what
a
dunkel
should
be
the
aroma
is
faint
and
of
roasted
malts
it
could
benefit
from
more
flavor
in
general
a
more
flavorful
version
of
this
would
be
a
world
class
beer
the
low
level
of
carbonation
makes
it
extremely
easy
to
drink
not
the
worst
of
its
kind
but
its
mediocre
at
best
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
overall
an
excellent
beer
for
drinking
with
food
bottle
of
negra
modelo
drank
this
is
a
good
mexican
beer
i
prefer
bohemia
but
negra
modelo
is
quite
good
when
you
cant
find
bohemia
i
need
to
add
salt
for
my
preference
many
will
nog
o
i
may
have
enjoyed
it
more
in
a
12oz
serving
getting
through
16oz
of
all
those
malted
malty
malts
was
challenging
it
gave
me
a
hop
craving
not
really
what
i
was
hoping
to
pair
with
my
burrito
i
need
a
darker
and
less
watered
down
beer
disclaimer
im
drinking
this
in
mexico
so
maybe
that
makes
a
difference
roasty
character
with
a
good
body
goes
well
with
most
foods
a
great
alternative
to
all
the
clear
beers
for
the
price
not
sure
how
you
can
ask
more
from
a
beer
out
of
mexico
but
beer
snobs
will
be
beer
snobs
and
people
on

still

i
got
this
at
my
local
tex
mex
joint
craving
a
change
from
the
dos
equis
i
usually
drink
while
im
there
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
especially
given
the
reviews
here
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
has
a
nice
sultry
bronze
color
with
a
small
fleeting
head
the
aroma
is
muted
but
i
definitely
detect
a
rich
maltiness
the
taste
was
actually
more
complex
than
i
figured
it
to
be
and
theres
a
definite
bite
of
alcohol
that
hits
you
with
the
carbonation
on
the
tongue
when
compared
to
other
mexican
beers
this
is
definitely
at
the
front
of
the
line
overall
not
bad
id
certainly
get
it
again
are
there
any
good
mexican
beers
great
taste
smoothnes
good
aroma
and
aftertaste
a
stout
right
unpretentious
but
totally
dispensable
nice
taste
always
good
beer
this
beer
is
bullshit
its
better
than
dos
equis
but
jesus
christ
family
of
mine
drink
this
and
consider
it
good
so
i
thought
it
was
worth
a
try
i
was
wrong
this
and
dos
equis
are
enough
to
make
me
avoid
mexican
beer
like
the
plague
i
love
mexican
tequilas
mezcals
pretty
much
anything
mexican
but
what
the
fuck
is
up
with
their
beers
its
got
a
weird
taste
bitter
but
with
no
pungency
it
tastes
kind
of
like
dirty
pool
water
with
alcohol
and
carbonation
in
it
i
want
to
like
it
for
conveniences
sake
but
my
god
i
have
rarely
been
this
disappointed
by
a
beer
fuck
this
dont
purchase
this
beer
is
not
very
good
as
the
name
suggests
its
a
dark
beer
its
not
heavy
and
it
doesnt
have
an
overpowering
taste
perfect
for
cooling
down
after
climbing
teotihuacan
or
taking
in
the
sights
on
a
hot
august
mexico
city
afternoon
carbonation
is
just
enough
and
the
finish
is
semi
dry
and
refreshing
overall
i
am
enjoying
this
brew
and
would
have
it
again

malty
and
refreshing
definitely
worth
a
try
edit
having
one
in
the
privacy
of
my
own
home
right
now
i
notice
now
that
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
an
almost
coffeelike
roastiness
to
it
which
occasionally
shows
up
in
the
taste
just
a
bit
blending
in
with
the
dark
bread
sort
of
flavor
mostly
im
finding
that
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
when
drinking
some
when
it
still
has
a
bit
of
the
foam
on
top
but
it
becomes
a
bit
less
smooth
afterward
also
finding
that
the
color
of
this
beer
and
how
clear
it
is
makes
it
look
really
nice
when
youve
got
decent
lighting
fiddled
with
reviews
just
a
bit
to
reflect
my
thoughts
guessing
the
score
probably
went
up
just
a
tad
overall
light
and
easy
drinking
im
sure
this
will
pair
well
with
carbheavy
spicy
mexican
food

overall
this
is
a
fine
mexicanlatin
beer
i
have
not
tried
the
modelo
amber
ale
yet
but
id
say
the
darker
side
of
modelo
is
the
way
to
go
the
flavors
are
easy
to
pull
out
and
are
not
too
over
the
top
fine
beer
its
simple
but
that
more
my
problem
with
the
beer
rather
than
that
making
the
beer
bad
this
is
better
than
most
mexican
imported
beers
but
not
by
a
whole
lot
only
if
theres
no
margarita
around
o
its
not
bad
i
usually
go
for
bohemia
or
this
if
thats
all
thats
available
at
mexican
joint
its
my
favorite
of
the
mexican
mainstream
beers
sweet
honey
aroma
along
with
a
nutty
toastiness
pours
very
deep
amber
with
a
white
head
its
very
easy
drinking
with
high
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
sticky
mouthfeel
to
the
taste
there
is
caramel
some
toffee
toast
and
sweet
malts
does
some
different
things
to
differentiate
itself
as
a
lager
and
i
liked
that
decent
stuff
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
if
you
want
to
start
drinking
some
mexican
beers
this
one
would
be
one
of
the
first
ones
i
would
try
there
is
obviously
better
mexican
beers
out
there
but
they
are
harder
to
get
your
hands
on
overall
3

i
would
certainly
have
this
again
im
not
going
to
rush
out
and
buy
a
pallet
of
it
but
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
id
gladly
drink
it
it
has
a
great
yeasty
body
with
nice
fruity
notes
and
heavy
bread
crust
at
the
end
i
like
the
bread
and
the
yeast
a
yeastwheat
flavor
remains
on
the
palate
long
after
the
swallow
a
decent
beer
worthy
of
a
taste
o
a
good
better
probably
the
best
of
the
massproduced
amber
lagers

i
like
this
one
from
the
bottle
so
this
was
a
real
treat
creamier
than
memories
keeping
in

i
like
light
beers
this
isnt
something
i
would
drink
much
not
bad
though
cheers
dark
caramel
brown

faint

and
not
much
else
i
get
nice

of

vienna
malt
the
mouth
is
thin
and
light
o
eh
mexico
whadaya
want
this
is
better
than
many
others
by
far
this
amounts
to
a
guilty
pleasure
for
me
my
first
choice
with
mexican
food
it
has
a
decent
appearance
a
pleasant
taste
and
a
pleasing
palate
overall
a
decent
cheap
beer
which
pairs
well
with
mexican
food
overall
this
was
my
first
mexican
beer
and
so
far
so
good
ive
heard
that
some
of
grupo
modelos
other
offerings
have
a
less
than
savoury
reputation
so
i
guess
i
picked
a
good
place
to
start
a
very
solid
drink
overall
revisiting
this
after
discovering
someone
left
three
of
these
in
my
fridge
this
is
actually
much
better
than
i
remember
but
still
only
an
average
beer
having
been
away
from
beer
for
a
long
while
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
drinking
i
used
to
be
a
light
beer
drinker
before
so
i
wanted
to
try
something
new
and
by
chance
and
curiosity
i
ordered
a
negra
modelo
wow
what
a
joy
it
was
drinking
that
first
bottle
when
ever
i
cant
find
it
i
try
other
darks
only
to
be
left
disappointed
thanks
to
the
brewers
of
this
fine
beer
i
now
have
found
my
afternoon
companion
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
mexican
beer
ive
had
to
date
and
is
easily
one
i
would
get
again
to
serve
with
tacos
enchiladas
or
other
authentic
mexican
food
not
half
bad
for
an
easy
drinking
mexican
lager
and
something
i
would
definitely
buy
at
a
mexican
restaurant
again
much
better
than
corona
ontap
at
joses
blue
sombrero
in
waukesha
wi
this
pours
a
brownish
amber
color
with
a
light
beige
head
since
it
was
served
with
a
lime
wedge
thats
all
i
can
smell
texture
is
light
and
thin
a
very
mild
taste
of
grain
like
most
mexican
beers
thin
and
watery
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
always
choose
when
i
visit
the
local
mexican
restaurant
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
at
home
either
especially
as
i
sit
in
the
yard
late
in
the
day
during
the
summertime
oepitome
of
a
brew
you
love
at
the
beginning
of
your
beer
drinking
journey
then
realize
later
down
the
road
is
not
as
good
as
you
thought
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
modelo
especial
is
more
pleasing
in
taste
and
more
refreshing
the
dark
lager
flavors
of
carameldark
bread
are
present
for
a
few
minutes
then
just
dilute
and
turn
metallic
sour
and
bitter
best
paired
with
mexican
food
if
you
had
to
drink
negra
modelo
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
malta
negra
modelo
has
a
light
feel
in
your
mouth
while
i
bought
a
six
pack
i
drank
each
beer
out
of
a
snifter
glass
its
a
decent
light
lager
thats
dark
in
color
it
as
a
malty
smell
and
taste
to
it
this
is
my
goto
beer
at
any
mexican
restaurant
i
love
how
this
beer
is
both
dark
and
malty
and
yet
also
quite
light
the
carbonation
balances
out
the
dark
malts
perfectly
it
is
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
but
with
a
pleasant
toastiness
also
interesting
how
this
beer
is
almost
singlehandedly
keeping
alive
the
vienna
lager
style
all
in
all
a
great
beer
i
went
into
this
not
knowing
what
to
expect
as
most
mexican
beers
are
fairly
forgettable
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
it
is
a
well
done
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
pleasant
flavor
profile
diacetyl
bomb
but
flavorful
malt
character
its
on
the
sweet
side
and
the
nutty
notes
make
it
appealing
im
1300
reviews
in
and
this
is
my
first
mexican
beer
beers
like
this
substantiate
why
pored
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
semi
transparent
reddish
amber
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
smells
of
some
decent
grain
a
little
fruitiness
tastes
of
some
fruitiness
with
caramelized
grain
very
nice
beer
is
light
bodied
a
tad
heavily
carbonated
but
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
o
cleaner
and
tastier
than
your
average
macro
lager
surprisingly
not
bad
and
a
lot
better
as
it
warms
we
wouldnt
buy
it
but
wed
certainly
drink
it
over
a
lot
of
other
things
weve
tasted
o
a
mildly
bitter
adjunct
beer
that
has
some
ok
flavors
but
is
overall
not
very
memorable
not
bold
enough
for
my
taste
but
definitely
good
with
some
tacos
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
very
very
drinkable
first
off
there
is
absolutely
no
good
reason
to
put
a
lime
wedge
into
a
darker
lager
beer
for
the
purpose
of
this
review
enjoyed
a
bottle
at
a
mexican
restaurant
after
said
lime
was
extracted
from
the
bottle
neck
this
is
my
favorite
widely
available
beer
down
in
mexico
and
i
will
drink
it
here
too
should
the
occasion
arise
bavaria
is
another
really
good
dark
mexican
lager
albeit
harder
to
find
at
restaurants
and
bars
this
brew
is
light
brown
looking
like
iced
tea
or
watery
cola
with
a
decent
amount
of
offwhite
to
light
tan
head
that
will
keep
its
shape
for
a
bit
provided
you
dont
kill
it
off
with
lime
juice
this
beer
is
also
served
icecold
pretty
much
anywhere
you
order
it
the
initially
weak
aroma
and
flavors
will
develop
if
the
beer
is
allowed
to
warm
up
a
bit
nose
and
palate
jive
quite
nicely
amber
and
dark
malts
providing
a
mellow
brown
sugar
backdrop
with
hints
of
raisin
and
roasted
barley
along
with
vanillaesque
floral
notes
and
some
hops
that
recall
sweet
hay
the
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
quite
thin
as
one
might
expect
but
well
worth
the
attention
that
you
probably
wouldnt
pay
to
a
corona
or
sol
malt
forward
but
not
aggressive
and
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
less
bold
than
other
munich
dunkels
ive
had
and
i
think
this
is
better
classfied
as
a
grafstyle
vienna
lager
the
aforementioned
bavaria
is
a
munich
dunkel
but
hey
its
a
good
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
12
oz
plastic
cup
at
the
airport
it
has
a
lovely
clear
mediumbrown
color
with
no
lacing
or
head
at
all
aroma
is
hops
caramel
and
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
is
hops
malt
caramel
mild
but
balanced
and
tipping
a
bit
more
to
the
hops
side
which
i
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
foamy
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
lager
but
i
really
prefer
alesporters
stouts
and
ipas
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
lighter
taste
that
brings
a
variety
of
light
tastes
but
really
you
should
throw
a
slice
of
lime
in
the
mix
and
it
becomes
to
me
the
best
mass
market
mexican
beer
out
there
o
for
mexican
beer
this
one
is
well
made
and
balanced
sweet
and
refreshing
without
too
much
bitterness
a
slightly
heavier
mouthfeel
would
please
me
more
but
this
beer
is
good
as
is
its
not
the
best
beer
it
has
a
sour
taste
and
i
always
notice
people
spit
after
they
drink
it
at
the
clubs
i
would
prefere
a
pabts
blue
ribbion
or
a
micky
instead
of
this
it
taste
ok
when
lime
is
added
but
other
then
that
it
has
a
bull
flavor
if
anything
i
would
consider
this
as
a
last
minute
beer
negra
modelo
is
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
mexican
beer
similar
to
kilt
lifter
in
look
and
feel
its
one
of
the
few
mexican
beers
ive
tried
that
i
dont
have
to
have
a
taco
in
my
hand
to
enjoy
i
thoroughly
enjoy
it
and
recommend
it
to
all
my
friends
when
we
go
out
for
mexican
food
pretty
good
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
buy
if
you
are
in
a
grocery
store
with
not
exactly
the
most
divine
of
selections
passable
not
outstanding
o
this
beer
is
one
of
my
first
loves
due
to
the
decoction
mashing
and
the
corresponding
rich
malty
backbone
its
a
shame
that
too
often
it
comes
stale
d
not
bad
but
not
great
very
easy
drinking
there
are
no
bad
or
off
flavors
present
but
nothing
about
the
beer
stands
out
i
dont
want
to
oversell
this
its
no
classic
but
i
do
think
its
better
than
the
general
run
of
mexican
beers
at
least
the
ones
you
can
easily
get
in
the
states
and
i
do
recommend
it
o
my
beer
of
choice
when
dining
at
a
mexican
restaurant
only
because
of
lack
of
selection
not
a
bad
beer
i
simply
want
something
more
bold
from
a
beer
this
dark
o
not
bad
but
not
great
would
definitely
be
a
fine
selection
at
any
mexican
restaurant
overall
an
average
drinkers
beer
can
be
enjoyed
at
anytime
and
takes
no
effort
to
appreciate
the
taste
has
a
chocolate
malt
flavor
with
a
backbone
of
grainy
malts
light
roasted
nut
and
toasted
bread
flavor
are
also
apparent
theres
a
lot
of
carbonation
feel
on
the
tongue
which
makes
it
crisp
but
watery
a
truer
taste
one
without
so
much
carbonation
would
be
stellar
but
may
not
serve
the
purpose
of
a
refreshing
dark
lager
a
decent
affordable
beer
not
for
special
occasions
something
a
little
different
to
session
with
or
a
good
beer
to
go
with
fast
food
serving
type
bottle
to
goblet
overall
my
go
to
beer
when
out
at
a
mexican
restaurant
though
due
to
lack
of
choice
more
than
anything
outside
that
its
a
beer
i
tend
to
steer
clear
from
as
there
are
significantly
better
dark
lager
choices
to
be
had
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
not
as
dark
as
others
but
hard
to
find
a
better
beer
at
most
texmex
restaurants
smooth
minimal
head
above
average
flavor
and
above
all
save
the
lime
for
your
food
a
great
accent
to
the
bob
armstrong
dip
and
the
chicken
chile
relleno
at
matts
rancho
martinez
in
big
d
this
isnt
a
fantastic
beer
but
its
probably
the
best
mexican
beer
ive
had
its
almost
bereft
of
aroma
and
has
a
very
mild
taste
without
much
character
to
speak
of
its
fairly
smooth
but
overall
there
just
aint
much
to
remark
on
its
ok
for
drinking
with
your
buddies
at
the
bar
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
as
my
first
as
an
aside
if
you
mix
in
a
shot
of
vodka
it
tastes
like
a
baltika
9
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
a
a
slight
hop
bite
introducing
itself
at
the
end
of
each
sip
mild
bitterness
an
enjoyable
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
mexican
brewed
beers
i
have
had
overall
negra
modelo
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
istypically
the
best
beer
on
draft
at
the
mexican
restaurants
near
my
house
o
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
at
mexican
restaurants
and
really
its
perfect
with
that
food
the
chocolatey
sweetness
perfectly
complements
the
spices
standing
alone
i
feel
it
lacks
complexity
and
body
but
it
is
definitely
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
comes
to
the
table
a
fairly
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
had
all
but
dissipated
before
the
glass
got
to
my
table
smells
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
with
a
faint
grainy
almost
bready
malt
in
the
background
very
light
floral
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
mostly
caramel
but
it
tastes
fake
moderate
sweet
maltiness
is
offset
with
a
burnt
butterscotch
and
faint
spicy
hop
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
mouthfeel
vienna
lager
is
quite
a
stretch
here
dark
adjunct
lager
fits
better
in
my
mind
nothing
horrible
here
but
the
artificial
taste
and
lack
of
complexity
kills
this
one
for
me
3
5s
across
the
board
decent
beer
flavorful
with
good
drinkability
nevertheless
all
depends
on
purpose
and
to
what
you
compare
this
to
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
if
i
could
give
this
disgusting
beer
a
negative
rating
i
would
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
russet
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
thin
film
and
ring
around
the
glass
leaving
light
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
spicy
graininess
flavor
starts
well
with
sweet
mild
toasted
malt
slight
breadiness
hint
of
caramel
but
ends
rather
abruptly
with
slight
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
light
bodied
a
step
above
other
macros
but
nothing
exciting
would
do
in
a
pinch
if
only
macro
beer
was
available
id
certainly
order
this
one
with
a
fajita
platter
anytime
the
brew
pours
out
a
very
nice
darkcaramel
color
not
black
like
the
name
of
the
beer
would
lead
you
to
believe
the
head
was
thin
but
strangely
the
lacing
was
noticeable
all
the
way
down
the
bottle
ive
never
seen
anything
like
it
the
smell
was
the
normal
hops
and
barley
but
the
odor
was
just
slight
just
the
right
amount
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
was
surprising
the
dark
liquid
was
thick
and
felt
velvety
the
taste
is
what
i
walked
away
with
impressed
full
and
rich
certainly
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
glad
i
did
overall
a
solid
beer
in
too
small
a
bottle
i
will
be
glad
to
partake
of
again
i
highly
recommend
this
macro
take
that
for
what
it
means
overall
not
really
a
brew
i
would
recommend
it
isnt
off
in
any
way
but
isnt
on
in
any
way
either
not
much
to
get
excited
about
but
fairly
true
to
style
pours
dark
ruby
brown
with
some
weak
etched
light
cream
foam
smells
like
cheap
beer
wheat
and
grain
some
soily
yeast
and
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
that
wherein
the
yeast
was
overtaxed
and
has
a
real
bad
ester
profile
with
sweet
vanilla
and
butter
flavors
some
nutty
character
light
bodied
with
hi
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
not
something
i
plan
to
revisit
asked
for
an
ale
in
a
mexican
restaurant
and
received
a
bottle
of
negra
modelo
had
tried
dos
equis
and
corona
ugh
so
was
expecting
another
alsoran
quite
a
surprise
currently
i
keep
some
on
hand
since
i
drink
in
such
moderation
that
a
6
pack
lasts
a
month
sometimes
but
when
i
want
an
ale
i
always
have
one
on
hand
the
taste
of
this
one
sort
of
surprised
me
this
is
my
first
beer
from
mexico
and
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
very
good
i
thought
it
would
taste
like
a
macro
or
something
instead
i
got
a
respectable
mexican
beer
theres
really
nothing
about
negra
modelo
that
stands
out
but
its
inoffensive
this
is
worlds
better
than
corona
apparently
and
unsurprisingly
as
said
havent
had
and
a
very
fair
beer
surprised
that
this
beer
from
south
of
the
border
was
this
good
i
really
like
this
beer
considering
its
price
and
that
it
is
available
almost
anywhere
it
has
a
nice
brown
coloring
really
malty
smooth
flavor
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
a
little
thicker
consistency
than
average
my
go
to
beer
if
no
other
darks
on
sale
o
the
hops
take
over
from
the
sweet
flavor
noted
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
pours
dark
copper
color
with
a
tight
inch
and
half
of
head
looks
nice
smells
malty
but
there
is
a
hint
of
corn
which
does
not
help
it
would
be
great
without
that
bit
of
corn
watery
taste
at
first
then
malty
every
so
slightly
roasted
malt
finishes
with
a
mild
hop
presence
nothing
too
impressive
light
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
low
carbonation
easy
to
drink
overall
for
a
dunkel
lager
it
lacks
the
malt
body
however
for
an
easy
drinking
lager
it
is
nice
awesome
it
reminds
me
of
somewhat
of
newcastle
brown
ale
this
stuff
is
an
instant
favorite
a
lot
of
dark
beers
have
a
bad
after
taste
to
me
but
this
one
does
not
at
all
if
you
like
dark
beers
this
one
is
a
must
have
i
also
liked
the
shape
of
the
bottle
shorter
and
wider
than
normal
had
to
come
back
and
update
this
one
then
decided
to
review
i
pored
this
from
a
bottle
into
a
tall
new
glarus
glass
looks
beautiful
in
the
light
decent
head
and
smells
delicious
tastes
even
better
a
now
must
have
for
my
fridge
for
me
this
is
an
instant
favorite
i
can
drink
it
warm
cold
bottled
or
in
a
glass
its
simple
easy
to
drink
and
really
tasty
this
ones
for
anyone
if
you
get
a
chance
try
it
negra
modelo
is
a
very
simple
beer
that
isnt
great
but
isnt
bad
either
many
of
the
mexican
chain
restaurants
around
my
house
serve
this
beer
and
it
compliments
a
burrito
much
better
than
a
corona
or
dos
equis
poured
this
dunkel
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
brown
color
produced
a
tannish
thick
head
excellent
retention
and
left
ample
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
features
toasted
grain
and
a
slight
citrus
hop
note
light
in
body
this
lager
features
toasted
grain
carmel
candy
sweetness
and
some
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
this
is
probably
my
favorite
mexican
brewed
beer
thus
far
not
outstanding
but
its
worth
a
try
post
now
this
is
just
personal
taste
but
after
awhile
the
light
feel
of
the
beer
wears
on
me
and
i
end
up
really
wishing
this
was
a
deep
rich
beer
however
if
you
drink
this
while
eating
a
burger
or
something
its
refreshing
as
hell
it
begs
to
be
paired
up
with
some
food
o
this
beer
is
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
could
definitely
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
and
it
pairs
very
nicely
with
the
flavors
of
mexican
cuban
and
south
american
food
much
better
than
i
expected
and
better
than
regular
modelo
this
beer
pours
dark
duh
given
the
name
its
a
blackish
red
with
a
tiny
head
and
minimal
latticework
the
smell
is
virtually
nonexistent
with
the
alcohol
ringing
through
the
taste
happily
is
better
than
the
smell
it
has
the
taste
of
a
richer
more
flavorful
lager
and
it
is
also
more
rich
and
textured
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
overall
a
decent
take
on
the
style
but
could
of
had
a
stronger
roast
flavor
i
would
always
take
this
over
the
other
mexican
macros
if
at
such
a
restaurant
overall
not
a
brilliant
version
of
a
german
dark
ale
it
is
reasonably
priced
though
so
i
suppose
it
just
depends
if
you
prefer
cheapness
or
good
quality
the
appearance
was
a
little
flatnot
much
bubbly
and
the
hickory
odor
made
it
come
across
old

that

i

its

on

bought
this
beer
on
sale
at
the
local
store
it
was
always
a
beer
that
i
passed
up
for
some
reason
the
bottles
have
a
very
unique
design
the
beer
pours
nicely
with
not
too
much
head
im
not
getting
too
much
on
the
smell
the
first
thing
i
taste
is
a
slight
toffee
taste
which
goes
down
real
smooth
i
was
pleased
with
this
beer
it
was
a
average
beer
and
may
be
one
of
your
better
choices
at
the
mexican
restaurant
i
could
only
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time

beer
was
quite
good
compared
to
the
other
mexican
beers
available
at
my
grocery
store
it
was
poured
into
a
regular
16oz
glass
cup
there
was
barely
any
head
foam
and
not
a
lot
of
bubbles
there
wasnt
much
of
an

not

there
is

going

if
available
to
go
with

one
is
a
standby
in
mexican
restaurants
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
poured
a
partially
hazy
brown
with
deep
ruby
highlights
when
backlit
the
one
inch
loose
offwhite
head
sizzled
and
receded
into
a
soapy
cap
nose
is
very
subdued
malt
perhaps
some
dark
fruit
undertones
light
banana
esters
and
a
hint
of
noble
hops
taste
follows
nose
nice
balance
between
malt
and
bitter
keeps
the
flavor
profile
on
an
even
keel
a
little
watery
and
finishes
with
a
little
bit
of
cereal
grain
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
an
even
background
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
all
and
all
not
a
bad
brew
and
a
nice
complement
to
a
mexican
dish
d
would
alsao
be
great
with
grilled
all
in
all
a
very
solid
contender
and
one
worth
trying
taste
shocker
goes
excellent
with
good
mexican
food
skip
the
lime
spice
is
good
as
the
small
amount
of
hops
will
come
out
very
carbonated
throughout
of
the
mexican
beers
ive
tried
negra
modelo
is
my
favorite
light
in
taste
and
body
great
hot
weather
beer
and
a
great
accompaniment
to
mexican
style
food
even
better
on
tap
when
you
can
find
it
taste
very
sweet
but
not
really
the
fruit
as
i
was
expecting
it
has
more
of
a
nutty
caramel
type
sweetness
with
very
little
bitterness
overall
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
but
what
it
does
it
does
right
final
thoughts
by
far
the
best
of
the
mexican
brews
a
great
choice
at
a
mexican
joint
usually
have
a
few
in
the
house
overall
i
had
to
drink
this
on
the
cold
side
which
helped
but
it
was
refreshing
if
nothing
else
though
i
prefer
the
especial
to
this
overall
a
moderate
beer
but
not
one
with
anything
special
about
it
this
style
is
german
which
means
that
many
masters
of
brewing
have
perfected
it
to
a
beautiful
level
that
this
mexican
macro
beer
does
not
come
close
to
a
better
choice
than
almost
all
budmillercoors
however
its
not
going
to
win
any
awards
but
this
is
head
and
shoulders
above
the
other
mexican
macro
lagers
a
bit
too
expensive
to
have
around
on
a
regular
basis
but
will
do
the
trick
in
a
mexican
restaurant
beer
has
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
the
smell
was
that
of
malt
caramel
it
has
a
light
taste
and
is
a
bit
sweet
the
finish
was
smooth
easy
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
beer
goes
best
with
food
especial
mexican
dishes
i
would
not
recommend
this
as
a
session
beer
poured
at
fridge
temperature
a
transparent
brown
into
a
standard
pilsner
glass
a
1
cream
coloured
head
that
sticks
around
foamy
lacing
lightly
malt
flavoured
very
drinkable
could
have
a
few
of
these
superior
to
standard
mexican
lagers
by
quite
a
wide
margin
mexican
beer
should
only
be
compared
to
mexican
beer
when
a
countrys
water
has
the
reputation
that
mexicos
has
one
shouldnt
expect
the
beer
thats
produced
there
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
other
beers
from
around
the
world
that
being
said
this
is
my
mexican
food
beer
have
one
while
waiting
for
the
food
to
be
ready
and
have
one
with
the
meal
it
is
best
this
way
not
a
sitting
around
drinking
beer
the
tongue
needs
a
break
way
to
often
have
a
few
in
the
frig
for
dinner
or
get
it
at
the
restraunt
d
good
drinkability
quite
refreshing
beer
d
not
much
flavor
but
it
goes
down
easy
especially
with
food
however
there
are
many
other
alternatives
i
would
reach
for
first
poured
an
amber
brown
white
head
that
faded
quickly
smell
is
big
malty
sweetness
with
some
stale
notes
that
i
cant
figure
out
but
arent
terribly
appealing
taste
is
watery
up
front
then
malty
sweetness
high
carbonation
helps
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
and
the
sweetness
definitely
helps
balance
out
the
spicy
mexican
food
i
had
this
with
decent
beer
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
but
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
brownish
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
medium
body
slightly
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
feel
that
it
is
usually
a
little
overpriced
in
the
store
usually
one
of
the
highest
but
if
i
found
a
little
more
affordable
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
one
and
a
half
fingers
white
head
slow
dissipation
with
above
average

dark
brown

forward
in

nose
munich
bready
caramel
sweet
malts
not
much
roastiness
may
have
flowery
hops
but
very
well
hidden
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
but
fairly
balanced
not
much
hop
presence
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
not
much
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
pretty
watery
pretty
drinkable
i
wouldnt
normally
drink
this
style
but
given
the
choices
all
mexican
beers
this
was
actually
pretty
good
not
to
do
sean
paxton
quality
beer
and
food
pairings
but
this
cut
through
the
spice
of
the
dish
nicely
worth
a
try
ill
keep
running
those
races
and
if
negra
is
the
best
beer
available
afterwards
ill
certainly
be
plenty
happy
the
thing
i
like
best
about
this
beer
is
that
it
sticks
to
its
typology
very
well
there
is
great
play
between
the
different
malt
and
hop
flavors
but
its
not
going
to
knock
you
out
with
any
of
them
its
not
heavy
or
heady
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
keep
on
hand
d
could
drink
a
few
but
not
more
than
that
with
mexican
food
this
is
a
winner
all
the
way
grabbed
a
six
of
this
the
other
day
as
i
had
some
over
christmas
at
my
cousins
and
decided
to
check
into
it
a
little
further
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
dark
carmel
color
about
like
strong
iced
tea
with
a
12
finger
watery
head
that
was
gone
in
a
squinit
lacing
was
short
lived
and
light
smelled
strongly
of
alchohol
and
malt
much
like
md
2020
back
in
the
day
taste
was
winey
and
somewhat
watery
and
was
gone
quickly
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
decent
and
on
the
thin
side
with
a
moderate
bite
and
not
unpleasant
mouth
to
nose
aroma
drinkability
was
ok
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
sell
the
farm
over
drink
some
for
yourself
and
you
be
the
judge
but
not
worth
9
00
a
six
in
my
humble
opinion
feel
is
smooth
and
watery
overall
negra
modelo
is
an
average
beer
there
are
many
more
suitable
options
for
the
style
but
at
the
same
time
im
not
dumping
this
down
the
drain
its
drinkable
but
id
prefer
something
with
more
taste
f
t
this
is
a
great
no
frills
beer
best
beer
from
mexico
would
be
ideal
for
cookouts
tailgating
chili
night
or
with
any
spicy
foods
drank
from
a
stubby
bottle
with
gold
foil
around
the
neck
and
no
freshness
date
some
sweet
malts
and
faint
cocoa
flavor
a
slight
mocha
flavor
in
the
profile
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
very
drinkable
and
tasty
with
some
spicey
wings
or
nachos
with
hot
peppers
d
very
drinkable
possibly
my
favorite
of
the
trip
lol
not
all
that
bad
just
not
really
good
either
on
the
whole
not
that
bad
and
when
cold
a
good
compliment
to
cheap
and
simple
mexican
chow
next
time
ill
just
drink
this
from
the
bottle
a
decent
vienna
lager
which
is
easy
to
drink
and
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
the
sweetness
is
possibly
a
little
bit
high
and
the
carbonation
definitely
is
but
overall
a
decent
beer
color
looks
pretty
similar
to
an
irish
red
zero
head
even
after
a
pretty
aggressive
pour
theres
not
much
to
smell
some
cane
sugar
sweetness
and
very
faint
coffee
has
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
that
really
lingers
nice
roasted
malt
notes
years
ago
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
my
how
the
palate
has
changed
thats
not
to
say
this
is
bad
im
just
a
little
blasé
about
it
now
certainly
nothing
offensive
about
this
brew
and
its
still
my
favorite
mexican
despite
looking
like
a
flat
coke
it
has
a
really
nice
feel
a
nice
thirst
quenching
way
to
start
out
my
new
years
eve
drinkability
quite
drinkable
i
havent
had
negra
modelo
in
awhile
and
have
forgotten
quite
how
much
i
like
it
drinkability
a
soso
beer
certainly
better
than
most
mexican
beers
ive
had
but
not
such
a
good
representation
of
the
munich
dunkel
lager
sytle
in
my
opinion
you
could
do
better
but
you
could
also
do
much
much
worse
not
bad
for
a
bar
beer
when
theres
not
much
else
available
but
i
woulnt
run
out
to
buy
a
6
probably
one
of
the
better
cerveza
overall
there
really
isnt
anything
special
about
this
beer
but
it
is
pretty
good
its
not
skunky
or
flat
or
thin
its
a
good
bodied
decent
dark
lager
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
it
at
a
party
but
i
probably
wouldnt
keep
it
on
had
at
the
house
negra
is
a
very
weak
bland
beer
not
worth
ever
trying
again
way
better
than
the
modelo
especial
salud
cheers
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
everything
comes
together
i
think
it
would
be
good
with
red
meat
d
outstanding
appearance
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
together
with
corona
extra
the
best
mexican
beers
and
adding
guinness
extra
stout
st
peters
cream
stout
and
moosehead
lager
my
five
favorite
beers
of
all
time
nicely
drinkable
when
in
mexico
seek
this
beer
out
my
favorite
mexican
beer
pours
a
dark
colour
with
touches
of
ruddiness
with
little
head
and
lacing
it
has
a
somewhat
of
a
toasted
smell
to
it
and
hints
of
toffee
and
cocoa
as
well
as
a
delightful
smokiness
embody
this
beer
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
the
aroma
is
ok
there
are
light
malts
throughout
reminded
me
of
a
bad
version
of
a
boston
lager
at
the
same
time
its
refreshing
to
drink
something
different
then
the
standard
light
mexican
beer
d
goes
down
smooth
but
somehow
is
filling
even
though
it
does
not
feel
that
heavy
dvery
dinkable
both
for
ease
of
drinking
and
for
the
relative
tastiness
of
this
brew
compared
to
other
mexican
brews
which
i
encountered
during
this
vacation
this
is
my
goto
beer
with
a
mexican
meal
refreshing
and
light
but
with
enough
character
and
body
to
be
enjoyable
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hop
bite
up
front
nothing
spectacular
but
the
best
of
the
typical
mexican
beers
this
is
a
fine
beer
with
tacos
its
a
semitransparent
blackishbrown
almost
the
color
of
cocacola
in
fact
a
guy
with
me
at
the
restaurant
though
i
had
a
mixed
drink
not
a
beer
malt
is
very
dominant
in
the
flavor
profile
with
slight
sweetness
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
are
really
undetectable
it
has
a
thin
body
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
interesting
probably
best
ice
cold
and
in
large
quantity
had
this
the
same
night
i
had
the
corona
at
peppitos
on
chicago
ave
this
one
was
good
it
poured
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
good
head
it
had
some
coffee
and
toffee
smells
with
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
the
same
it
was
sweet
with
roasted
toffee
and
a
light
coffee
taste
with
some
sweet
malts
it
has
a
medium
mouth
feel
nothing
overwhelming
overall
not
a
bad
lager
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
fizzy
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
maybe
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
is
the
same
nice
malty
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
cocoa
a
slight
bit
of
hops
rounds
things
out
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
tastes
but
is
a
good
sessionable
beer
drinkability
a
decent
mexican
beer
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
head
and
not
much
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
smell
involves
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
breadiness
but
nothing
is
overpowering
the
proper
flavors
come
out
a
bit
more
in
the
nose
but
nothing
too
special
mediumbodied
and
smooth
offering
pretty
good
drinkability
and
probably
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beginners
dark
beer
this
beer
is
just
okay
good
but
not
great
this
tasted
pretty
much
like
a
nondescript
everybeer
nothing
too
strong
nothing
too
watery
nothing
too
thick
nothing
too
pungent
goes
down
smooth
but
nothing
special
smells
like
malts
and
hops
and
bread
but
nothing
special
tastes
like
a
well
balanced
clean
cut
brew
but
nothing
special
just
an
across
the
board
average
beer
i
tried
this
beer
at
a
mexican
restaurant
and
i
wish
i
had
a
marguerita
perhaps
the
keg
was
old
or
the
tap
lines
are
dirty
as
other
ba
appear
to
like
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
during
the
summer
when
it
is
on
sale
it
makes
a
nice
michelada
of
course
a
better
beer
would
be
wasted
with
less
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
might
make
this
more
pleasant
it
would
be
smoother
as
it
is
your
tongue
is
bitten
overall
probably
the
best
mexican
beer
ive
had
to
date
clean
and
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
a
smooth
feeling
and
a
taste
thats
not
too
overpowering
id
definitely
have
this
again
oh
im
so
disappointed
with
this
i
thought
maybe
just
maybe
mexicans
could
brew
a
dark
beer
with
more
character
than
their
pale
shit
but
no
im
not
enjoying
this
not
undrinkable
but
not
pleasant
overall
its
not
offensive
but
its
very
very
bland
indeed
and
i
really
dislike
the
feel
its
undoubtably
drinkable
but
its
certainly
not
something
of
which
id
choose
to
partake
regularly
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
mild
a
bit
malty
taste
is
of
malts
with
some
bitterness
nothing
special
here
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
mediocore
offering
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
certainly
the
best
mexico
has
to
offer
in
my
opinion
pairs
wonderfully
with
mexican
food
and
its
easy
drinking
but
mediocre
at
best
by
itself
extremely
drinkable
and
well
balanced
a
sure
fire
choice
for
me
at
any
mexican
restaurant
that
has
it
and
a
could
make
for
a
great
session
beer
with
some
homemade
tortilla
chips
di
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
smooth
and
balanced
and
one
of
the
lightest
dark
beers
i
have
sampled
finish
dry
finish
with
bitter
aftertaste
conclusion
this
is
one
of
those
big
imports
that
you
can
find
at
a
lot
of
restaurantsbars
out
especially
mexican
or
texmex
places
its
definitely
better
than
your
average
american
macrolager
and
most
of
the
big
imports
heineken
becks
corona
etc
and
goes
wonderfully
with
mexican
or
spicy
food
other
than
that
its
nothing
real
special
d
a
decent
beer
and
better
than
a
lot
of
other
choices
good
for
a
summer
day
or
a
bbq
i
had
this
at
a
good
mexican
place
usually
i
enjoy
beers
like
this
with
texmex
though
this
pretty
much
had
no
body
for
a
dark
beer
hardly
any
flavor
or
aromatic
character
either
i
will
avoid
this
from
now
on
and
drink
bohemia
instead
lager
taste
and
feel
with
a
hint
of
a
sweet
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
not
complexed
but
different
enough
for
me
to
have
enjoyed
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
ive
had
so
far
a
nice
beer
to
choose
when
you
go
to
a
mexican
restaurant
amber
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
head
a
lot
of
malt
flavors
almost
to
the
point
of
being
bread
like
its
nicely
carbonated
so
i
find
it
easy
to
drink
several
i
usually
order
this
when
we
go
to
our
favorite
mexican
place
in
our
neighborhood
d
its
easily
drinkable
but
not
fantastic
by
at
all
very
mediocre
in
my
opinion
but
it
goes
down
well
and
doesnt
offend
not
exactly
what
one
would
seek
in
a
germanstyle
beer
but
for
hot
weather
and
spicy
mexican
food
this
provides
an
easydrinking
choice
with
enough
character
to
balance
the
refreshment
angle
allaround
very
good
beer
that
is
very
light
despite
its
billing
as
a
dark
beer
literally
update
later
that
night
a
got
a
killer
headache
and
the
only
time
beer
does
to
me
is
when
i
drink
the
cheap
stuff
so
drinkability
goes
from
4
to
1
never
again
probably
my
favorite
mexican
beer
at
least
that
ive
had
so
far
they
like
to
jam
a
lime
in
it
which
works
okay
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
either
way
goes
good
with
mexican
cuisine
clear
dark
cherry
colored
with
a
quickly
fading
tan
colored
head
that
leaves
filmy
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
light
brown
sugar
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
caramel
malt
and
slight
vanilla
with
just
enogh
fruity
hop
bittering
to
balance
light
bodied
with
effervescent
seltzery
carbonation
this
is
probably
the
best
mexico
has
to
offer
good
for
washing
down
chiles
rellenos
i
suppose
this
would
go
well
with
some
spicy
mexican
food
but
i
would
never
drink
this
in
its
own
right
d
i
could
drink
as
many
of
these
as
i
bought
but
luckily
i
only
bought
one
d
i
had
two
could
have
had
more
pretty
easy
drinking
salud
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
it
is
the
only
good
mexican
beer
i
have
had
the
taste
makes
a
unique
but
strong
statement
without
being
overly
powerful
more
refined
than
their
leon
d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
with
mexican
food
as
it
pairs
well
with
spicey
dishes
its
easy
drinking
also
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
texture
is
easy
and
appealing
rolling
gently
behind
the
beers
rather
unpleasant
palate
i
wouldnt
come
back
to
this
beer
again
in
the
future
ill
leave
the
munich
style
lagers
to
their
mother
country
who
do
them
so
well
im
pretty
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
overall
flavor
previously
the
sum
of
my
mexican
beer
was
corona
and
corona
light
this
is
far
better
i
would
drink
this
beer
any
day
if
there
wasnt
anything
awesome
around
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
perfect
if
you
wanted
to
have
a
nice
big
mexican
dinner
i
can
also
see
it
being
a
decent
sipping
beer
as
well
but
the
fact
its
a
bit
heavy
on
the
gut
takes
away
from
the
experience
still
i
would
recommend
this
and
is
certainly
worth
at
least
one
try
d
even
though
there
is
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
i
still
enjoy
drinking
it
good
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
with
a
bag
of
tortilla
chips
and
some
salsa
drinkability
refreshing
and
fairly
wellbalanced
not
bad
for
an
inexpensive
widely
available
brew
great
with
chips
and
salsa
drinkability
its
not
bad
anyone
for
dessert
after
a
couple
modelo
especials
drinkability
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
pleasant
tasting
dark
beer
that
went
down
very
smoothly
best
mexican
beer
i
have
tasted
and
would
go
well
with
a
nice
steak
or
mexican
dishes
nothing
special
until
you
try
the
beers
that
are
generally
on
the
menu
with
it
decent
and
drinkable
d
easy
to
drink
pairs
well
with
mexican
food
with
which
i
was
drinking
it
with
couldnt
see
drinking
this
by
itself
but
its
far
better
than
corona
drinkability
it
was
ok
better
choices
unsure
about
freshness
though
which
i
doubt
because
i
thought
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
better
i
will
try
again
drink
not
at
all
difficult
to
consume
my
personal
preference
is
for
the
palate
to
be
clean
once
the
potable
has
exited
into
the
esophagus
yeah
i
know
that
you
are
tired
of
me
saying
that
but
i
like
what
i
like
d
easy
to
drink
lager
and
out
of
the
mexican
brews
i
prefer
this
one
over
most
it
isnt
complicated
and
definitely
a
summer
beer
as
a
side
note
i
cook
a
lot
with
this
beer
too
good
for
adding
flavor
and
tenderizing
meat
when
you
dont
want
a
heavy
porter
flavor
lingering
on
your
food
d
a
good
session
beer
my
favorite
of
the
mexican
beers
easily
has
a
real
taste
and
substance
to
it
but
doesnt
sacrifice
drinkability
taste
is
a
bit
better
the
dry
malt
brings
in
a
bit
of
a
nutty
taste
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
joins
the
sugary
finish
mouthfeel
is
weak
but
expected
drinkability
is
pretty
good
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
sweet
malt
and
some
yeast
cleanliness
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
dunkel
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
up
front
then
strong
yeast
cleanliness
and
some
very
slight
roasted
malt
in
the
finish
overall
a
rather
decent
munich
style
dunkel
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
as
session
beers
dr
yes
indeedy
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
tastes
great
on
the
way
i
first
encountered
negra
modelo
in
berrego
springs
ca
and
fell
in
love
with
it
d
fantastic
could
drink
a
sixpac
on
a
hot
day
very
underrated
underappreciated
beer
d
sessionable
and
decent
enough
for
a
few
on
a
hot
day
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
mexico
at
least
i
have
something
to
seek
out
i
had
this
at
a
mexican
restaurant
recently
and
it
complemented
the
food
perfectly
so
i
decided
it
was
time
to
revisit
copp
color
comes
from
a
rigorous
pour
about
a
finger
of
white
head
results
by
the
looks
of
it
this
brew
will
be
very
carbonated
nose
gives
off
some
sweet
grain
smells
bit
of
milk
chocolate
as
well
definitely
tastes
very
grainy
sweet
like
graham
crackers
chocolate
comes
through
a
bit
and
there
is
a
sort
of
metallic
twang
too
not
as
carbonated
as
i
was
expecting
and
fairly
light
in
body
very
good
drinkability
it
compliments
food
extremely
well
next
time
skip
the
corona
and
go
for
this
instead
not
a
bad
beer
it
may
not
even
be
fresh
but
at
least
its
still
drinkable
the
way
it
is
gotta
be
good
for
something
after
all
not
bad
but
kind
of
overpriced
taste
like
what
should
be
another
cheap
mexican
beer
finishing
taste
is
similar
to
corona
nothing
great
but
not
bad
either
probably
worth
a
try
some
may
really
like
it
to
me
its
just
pretty
average
though
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
amber
with
little
head
and
no
lace
smell
and
taste
of
sweet
roasted
malts
light
caramel
with
a
crisp
mild
bitterness
that
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
i
had
a
bottle
while
waiting
for
my
mexican
takeout
and
ended
up
buying
a
sixer
for
the
evening
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
cocacola
colored
the
beeer
poured
a
nice
head
but
it
did
not
last
long
at
all
it
left
decent
lacing
but
really
who
cares
about
that
the
beer
smelled
sour
to
me
taste
was
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
flat
tasting
no
good
to
me
i
will
not
buy
agaiun
as
i
have
tried
this
beer
repeadedly
and
always
get
the
same
bad
beer
for
now
though
i
definitely
recommend
you
try
this
beer
because
chances
are
that
you
wont
taste
what
i
taste
full
of
flavor
and
pretty
smooth
go
for
it
cheers
ok
youll
have
to
excuse
me
but
i
cant
understand
why
people
like
that
much
this
beer
to
me
is
just
a
dark
version
of
coronas
with
some
more
body
and
aroma
and
some
more
tasty
but
nothing
that
i
havent
tasted
in
many
beers
before
clear
brown
colour
a
little
head
that
doesnt
hold
and
leaves
no
leace
it
smells
a
bit
of
cocoa
powder
faint
caramel
and
toasted
notes
and
some
metallic
notes
watery
metallic
taste
with
hints
of
cocoa
and
caramel
and
theres
a
little
more
that
you
can
tell
if
anything
ive
tried
several
times
to
try
to
convince
myself
but
not
this
is
a
surprisingly
respectable
session
beer
and
worth
giving
a
shot
d
excellent
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
brew
me
gusta
negra
modelo
sorry
thats
about
all
i
remember
from
high
school
d
quite
a
drinkable
mexican
beer
this
is
definitely
going
to
be
my
mexican
restaurant
goto
i
find
this
very
drinkable
at
a
happy
hour
with
chips
and
salsa
i
could
easily
have
a
bunch
of
these
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
the
fact
that
is
is
readily
available
causes
it
to
magically
appear
in
the
refridgerator
frequently
this
is
a
good
beer
for
cookouts
and
kayaking
better
than
corona
or
sol
this
was
my
go
to
beer
in
mexico
d
this
is
one
of
the
few
mexican
brews
that
i
really
like
and
this
paired
well
with
my
shrimp
fajitas
easily
sessionable
note
i
had
this
on
tap
several
times
when
i
was
in
mexico
and
it
went
with
the
food
very
nicely
d
i
suppose
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
when
youre
consuming
mexican
style
food
or
really
any
food
that
compliments
the
americanstyle
dark
lager
i
think
it
fit
the
mentioned
style
better
than
a
munich
dunkel
munich
dunkel
would
imply
a
richer
malt
character
which
this
certainly
lacks
nonetheless
its
a
decent
beer
but
is
hardly
worth
seeking
out
as
if
you
had
to
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
mid
size
offwhite
head
average
retention
actually
some
nice
looking
lace
mild
toasted
malt
sweetness
with
light
grassy
hop
aromas
slightly
fruity
taste
some
grain
and
lightly
toasted
malt
sweetness
finishes
with
herbal
hops
a
bit
of
a
metallic
finish
light
to
medium
body
average
carbonation
easily
drinkable
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
would
go
well
with
spicy
foods
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
finger
tall
soapy
head
leaves
stucco
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
subdued
you
gotta
get
your
nose
right
down
there
before
you
can
detect
some
lightly
toasted
malts
and
earthy
tones
a
bit
of
honey
the
medium
bottle
was
very
smooth
almost
slick
and
tasted
of
toasty
and
sweet
malts
that
were
sufficiently
sweet
to
stand
up
to
my
enchilladas
one
of
the
few
popular
mexican
beers
ive
had
that
actually
goes
well
with
spicy
mexican
food
d
goes
down
smooth
and
refreshing
for
a
dark
beer
not
heavy
i
liked
the
lacing
in
the
glass
good
beer
for
grilling
d
easily
quaffable
and
one
of
the
best
mexican
imports
ive
had
to
date
admittedly
a
small
list
nothing
outstanding
but
a
solid
interesting
take
on
a
german
style
nutty
flavors
really
shine
in
this
beer
there
is
still
some
toastiness
here
but
it
is
a
bit
more
muted
than
the
smell
would
indicate
feels
like
a
lager
with
its
thin
body
and
smooth
crisp
character
highly
drinkable
and
surprisingly
refreshing
i
can
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
of
this
beer
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
goes
away
quite
fast
almost
no

aroma
is
slightly
grainy
with
a
faint
note
of
alcohol
flavor
is

a
clear
dark

very
little

very
smooth
light
to
medium
bodied

easy

minimal
lacing
throughout
almost
light
tasting
very
sessionable
despite
abv
probably
would
not
purchase
again
but
would
gladly
partake
of
if
offered
just
not
my
type
you
know
not
really
half
bad
its
amazing
that
this
is
put
out
by
the
same
company
as
corona
not
to
say
corona
is
undrinkable
just
sort
of
blah
this
one
isnt
blah
at
all
it
pours
dark
amber
has
a
somewhat
hoppy
smell
and
you
can
taste
the
hops
in
the
aftertaste
a
little
bit
maybe
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
i
could
drink
these
and
my
partner
really
likes
them
a
lot
notes
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
flagship
mexican
beers
never
disappoints
and
please
hold
the
lime
pretty
drinkable
and
a
mildly
decent
representation
of
a
dunkel
though
falling
short
a
bit
though
perhaps
not
falling
short
of
the
aims
of
the
brewers
the
royal
treatment
on
the
bottle
is
indicative
of
the
superiority
of
this
brew
over
the
vast
majority
of
its
homelands
bretheren
though
compared
to
its
overseas
counterparts
its
far
from
royal
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
initial
head
but
almost
no
lacing
good
malty
scent
almost
deep
but
no
real
distinguishing
characteristics
nice
taste
malty
with
a
slight
roastiness
to
it
and
an
almosthop
almostbitterness
to
the
aftertaste
goes
down
well
its
my
prefered
beer
at
mexican
restaurants
that
dont
serve
microbrews
d
if
i
am
enjoying
some
good
mexican
food
this
is
going
to
be
the
beer
i
will
drink
nice
atmosphere
good
flavor
and
a
decent
feel
not
complex
but
tasty
does
feature
really
good
drinkability
good
quaff
it
is
a
bit
heavy
and
i
found
it
quite
filling
so
its
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
have
several
of
at
one
time
but
was
excellent
nonetheless
this
beer
is
much
better
than
the
other
crap
imported
from
mexico
it
is
a
whiskey
brown
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
scent
of
molasses
and
i
smelled
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
very
safe
it
is
not
completely
watered
down
but
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
leave
an
impression
on
you
it
is
comfortable
in
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
if
debating
between
mexican
imports
a
cut
above
the
other
widely
available
beers
from
mexico
clear
crisp
clean
and
mild
are
descriptors
that
come
to
mind
when
i
first
began
to
explore
beer
the
mexican
imports
were
where
i
started
they
were
relatively
inexpensive
and
easily
available
negra
modelo
is
the
only
one
i
still
drink
on
occasion
a
nice
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
most
mexican
beers
it
has
nutty
caramel
taste
to
it
im
not
really
picking
much
up
on
it
smell
this
beer
reminds
a
lot
of
newcastle
it
looks
like
it
will
be
a
lot
more
aggressive
than
it
actually
is
it
a
decent
beer
nothing
to
get
to
excited
over
but
worth
giving
a
try
once
in
a
while
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
decent
molasses
color
with
little
to
no
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
mild
malt
some
roasted
coffee
sweet
caramel
and
some
alcohol
as
well
the
taste
is
decent
not
overwhelming
in
any
category
some
stronger
malt
taste
with
a
mild
hop
balance
there
is
a
higher
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
especially
with
the
limited
head
this
is
a
decent
brew
especially
compared
to
some
of
the
other
mexican
imports
you
can
get
d
good
drinkability
can
easily
drink
this
and
feel
like
another
would
be
in
order
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
recommended
pours
a
dark
redbrown
colored
body
with
a
good
sized
head
thats
slightly
offwhite
and
lasting
has
a
malty
aroma
a
very
malty
taste
and
has
a
slightly
fizzy
palate
but
is
slightly
watery
has
a
malty
aftertaste
one
of
the
few
dark
lagers
i
enjoy
pours
clear
brown
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
caramel
and
nut
aroma
very
sweet
taste
is
bready
and
grainy
somewhat
toasty
but
not
like
you
would
find
in
a
stout
or
porter
barelythere
hops
happens
to
be
one
of
the
few
mexican
beers
i
consume
indoors
and
with
my
shirt
on
it
poured
a
transparent
mediumbrown
with
a
very
thin
head
that
lasted
only
a
few
seconds
very
little
aroma
the
body
thin
very
thin
and
a
taste
to
match
its
the
same
style
as
sam
adams
and
i
could
tell
ther
is
a
small
resemblance
but
not
enough
of
one
to
impress
me
i
thought
the
taste
was
decently
hoppy
but
a
bit
wattereddown
im
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
drinkability
is
high
great
session
beer
that
is
widely
available
and
pairs
well
with
the
food
it
is
commonly
served
with
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
vienna
lager
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
smell
is
of
toasted
grain
taste
is
malty
sweet
hint
of
chocolate
with
a
slightly
odd
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
lively
carbonation
quite
drinkable
though
i
could
have
several
of
these
though
imo
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
a
very
drinkable
brew
with
decent
south
of
the
border
fare
not
the
mouth
coating
or
filling
beverage
but
slight
sweetness
cuts
thru
the
heat
very
well
my
choice
for
mexican
beer
the
taste
has
light
notes
of
caramel
malt
and
a
light
hop
bitterness
especially
in
the
finish
very
noncomplex
beer
but
its
a
very
smooth
drinker
and
it
is
very
easy
to
put
a
couple
away
in
short
order
it
is
quite
good
for
what
it
is
so
i
cant
knock
it
much
drinkability
drank
this
without
food
i
hear
it
goes
well
with
mexican
nonetheless
a
decent
lager
that
can
be
a
nice
changeup
from
some
of
the
macro
offerings
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
ton
of
things
to
love
a
great
taste
that
hints
of
burnt
caramel
and
coffee
a
good
head
and
is
easy
to
find
i
have
enjoyed
this
for
years
it
is
not
equal
to
many
others
but
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
i
had
a
sixer
of
this
in
sedona
arizona
and
it
was
just
perfect
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
large
thick
white
head
it
still
tastes
like
a
mexican
lager
but
with
body
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
nice
malt
finish
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
super
drinkable
almost
reminds
me
of
a
weak
bodied
amber
ale
this
is
a
great
mexican
beer
dont
like
things
like
corona
or
landshark
fool
you
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
faint
aroma
which
is
basically
the
only
knock
on
it
other
than
that
the
rest
is
gravy
has
such
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
maltyhoppy
taste
that
finishes
so
smooth
it
doesnt
have
as
much
flavor
as
other
darker
beers
out
there
but
it
makes
up
for
it
drinkability
for
a
dark
beer
its
surprisingly
mellow
in
terms
of
flavor
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
appreciated
that
a
lot
now
that
ive
had
it
again
recently
i
like
that
i
dont
have
to
commit
to
it
in
order
to
have
a
good
experience
great
with
street
tacos
a
dark
burgandy
with
light
carbonation
that
almost
immediatly
seems
to
fade
little
head
retention
smells
of
yeast
with
a
slight
under
current
of
spices
taste
is
viscous
cool
and
creamy
across
the
tongue
it
has
a
light
oaken
notes
with
a
light
nuttiness
and
sweet
undercurrent
not
a
very
strong
tasting
beer
theres
a
delayed
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
fades
quickly
drinkability
is
high
because
its
inoffensive
play
in
the
mouth
and
because
it
doesnt
bludgeon
you
with
with
flavour
or
alcohol
drinkability
its
okay
for
the
style
but
id
probably
reach
for
the
dos
equis
amber
or
the
sam
adams
boston
lager
first
light
enough
to
drink
a
couple
of
but
the
taste
isnt
good
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
d
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
but
it
paired
very
well
with
my
steak
burrito
d
every
now
and
then
in
a
mexican
restaurant
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
immediately
decent
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
bread
tasted
bland
a
bit
bitter
with
a
watery
feel
on
the
palate
somewhat
watery
and
flat
goes
well
with
fajitas
chips
and
salsa
thats
about
it
this
is
a
fine
macro
lager
believe
it
or
not
it
looks
like
a
macro
heavily
carbonated
with
a
soapy
head
that
disappears
right
away
smell
is
nothing
special
dry
corny
esthers
come
through
pretty
decent
coloring
however
deep
dark
redblack
coloring
tastes
really
good
especially
with
a
burrito
pretty
malty
weak
body
and
no
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
not
bad
but
not
good
either
overall
even
though
this
is
a
cheapy
beer
its
not
too
bad
for
a
mexican
ale
probably
wont
order
it
again
but
if
your
stuck
between
a
corona
tecate
or
this
i
would
definitely
choose
this
one
certainly
a
little
different
than
the
other
mexican
beers
ive
had
poured
a
deep
amber
color
a
small
white
head
and
hardly
any
lacing
at
all
richer
flavors
than
many
other
mexican
beers
malty
caramel
flavors
some
grain
the
finish
is
rather
bland
i
wouldnt
put
a
lime
in
this
one
was
served
with
one
not
a
bad
beer
went
pretty
well
with
the
mexican
dish
i
had
overall
marginal
average
run
of
the
mill
soso
ok
alright
fair
to
middling
probably
my
favorite
dark
beer
next
to
newcastle
of
course
first
time
i
had
it
i
was
in
detroit
and
my
boss
bought
it
and
i
thought
it
looked
cheap
because
of
the
stupid
tin
foil
on
the
top
of
the
bottle
and
i
had
never
heard
of
it
so
he
let
me
try
one
of
his
and
it
tasted
just
like
it
smelled
delicious
about
a
week
later
i
had
to
pick
some
of
it
up
it
was
that
good
ive
had
this
a
lot
before
but
usually
when
i
get
mexican
beer
ill
go
for
the
lighter
ones
after
revisiting
it
however
i
might
start
getting
this
instead
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
quickly
receeding
onefinger
head
smell
is
faint
but
decent
at
least
it
isnt
metallic
or
grainy
like
other
cheap
imports
south
of
the
border
light
to
mediumbodied
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
while
delivering
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
bite
some
semisweet
malts
in
there
but
they
quickly
fade
for
a
somewhat
dry
backbite
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
nothing
else
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
not
bad
for
a
lager
i
was
surprised
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
like
this
and
i
did
the
aroma
is
deceiving
taste
is
of
yeast
bitter
hops
and
alcohol
fumes
odd
since
this
is
not
a
high
alcohol
content
beer
i
do
not
find
the
fruity
sweetness
presented
in
the
aroma
anywhere
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
which
surprises
me
finishes
with
a
distinct
alcoholic
flavor
and
the
tiniest
bit
of
hop
bitterness
i
am
not
inclined
to
try
this
again
d
reasonably
high
drinkability
not
overwhelming
or
heavy
and
very
enjoyable
would
go
good
with
grilled
foods
poured
to
a
small
head
that
faded
pretty
fast
not
much
lacing
to
brag
about
light
brown
in
color
smelled
very
light
with
hints
of
malt
and
caramel
not
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
taste
going
on
here
slightly
sweet
with
malt
felt
very
thin
in
the
mouth
carbonation
i
thought
was
okay
i
like
to
try
new
beer
as
everyone
does
but
so
far
im
not
a
big
fan
of
mexican
beers
maybe
its
the
water
i
dont
think
i
would
make
this
a
session
beer
this
beer
along
with
bohemia
are
the
only
really
good
common
mexican
imports
you
cant
go
wrong
with
either
with
or
without
mexican
food
my
friend
and
i
discovered
this
beer
during
a
spring
vacation
in
a
little
town
about
120
miles
down
the
coast
of
baja
california
mexico
this
was
the
only
beer
we
could
find
down
there
that
wasnt
like
tecate
of
corona
very
smooth
and
tasty
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
and
the
beer
poured
great
into
a
glass
from
both
bottles
and
from
the
tap
of
course
once
we
got
back
to
the
states
i
realized
that
most
of
the
grocery
stores
around
here
carry
this
beer
perhaps
i
never
noticed
it
before
anyway
this
is
truly
my
favorite
mexican
beer
one
that
i
have
fond
memories
from
d
could
happily
quaff
several
of
these
session
beers
and
without
the
citrus
now
pours
a
dark
amber
with
some
nice
red
highlights
and
a
soft
bone
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lace
as
it
vanishes
the
nose
smells
like
an
old
wood
trunksome
caramel
notes
are
in
there
as
well
this
has
more
flavor
than
others
ive
had
from
across
the
bordernot
a
lot
of
flavorjust
more
than
i
am
used
to
some
lightly
toasted
breadsand
nice
subtle
nuttinessmaybe
some
almond
and
vinnilanice
the
moutfeel
is
very
light
and
smoothe
even
velvety
my
first
time
having
the
negra
was
enjoyablenow
i
need
fajitas
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
great
example
of
vienna
lager
its
malty
clean
and
crisp
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
of
the
choices
available
there
it
worked
out
pretty
good
but
i
wont
be
adding
it
to
the
fridge
anytime
soon
this
is
a
good
summer
session
beers
refreshing
and
crisp
it
has
more
flavor
than
corona
or
dos
equis
good
with
or
without
a
lime
tastes
and
pours
a
bit
like
cola
soda
dark
malts
with
light
hop
presence
not
all
beers
need
to
be
complex
or
extreme
sometimes
its
nice
to
just
have
something
to
just
kick
back
with
that
is
still
much
better
than
most
macro
swill
like
bud
or
coors
this
is
probably
my
favorite
mexican
beer
d
easy
to
drink
it
wont
blow
you
away
with
its
new
and
fantastic
taste
but
i
can
see
taking
3
or
4
away
in
a
night
and
being
happy
with
that
recommended
served
on
tap
at
the
riu
palace
in
playacar
at
many
of
the
bars
in
the
resort
it
was
served
too
cold
but
thats
okay
considering
the
hot
weather
looked
great
be
it
in
a
normal
glass
or
a
gasp
hard
plastic
10oz
glass
at
the
swimup
bar
hard
to
tell
the
smell
really
i
think
they
dont
quite
know
what
beerclean
means
taste
was
okay
if
it
wasnt
freezing
and
it
was
very
drinkable
many
after
the
other
glad
the
resort
was
all
inclusive
or
i
might
have
spent
a
fortune
overall
an
average
beer
would
not
drink
it
much
outside
of
a
mexican
restaurant
very
drinkable
dark
beer
for
the
warm
weather
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
taste
which
makes
it
go
down
nicely
in
the
warm
weather
but
there
is
also
enough
flavor
to
it
that
it
does
not
get
boring
definitely
something
to
choose
if
you
are
looking
for
a
very
drinkable
dark
beer
a
place
to
start
for
folks
who
are
more
used
to
light
beer
and
excellent
pairing
with
meals
a
decent
brew
d
probably
the
best
beer
you
will
find
in
your
average
mexican
restaurant
id
choose
it
over
sam
adams
if
the
flavour
is
as
good
as
i
had
it
tonight
drinkability
one
of
my
favorites
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
not
bad
overall
there
is
definitely
worse
stuff
out
there
pretty
good
for
a
macro
offering
thought
i
would
try
something
different
than
a
corona
at
the
mex
restaurant
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
came
with
a
frosty
glass
which
i
allowed
to
get
closer
to
room
temp
before
i
poured
minimal
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
slight
lacing
sweet
smelling
mid
to
high
carbonated
i
felt
bloated
after
drinking
which
left
me
very
burpy
finished
a
little
bitter
but
had
light
to
medium
body
to
it
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
dont
mind
the
bloated
feeling
not
that
impressed
d
very
drinkable
lager
w
nice
dark
malt
and
mild
sweetness
overall
the
woody
hops
and
toffee
like
malt
w
milky
tinges
is
very
easy
to
quaff
a
very
good
mexican
beer
compared
to
most
i
drink
this
with
quesadillas
often
viva
la
mexico
my
favorite
mexican
beer
appearance
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
it
taste
of
sweet
malts
with
a
little
nuttyness
very
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
day
or
with
a
dinner
plate
i
prefer
no
lime
i
dont
understand
the
lime
thing
maybe
because
i
accually
like
beer
but
i
dunno
an
okay
beer
i
usually
opt
for
this
when
in
a
beer
mood
at
a
mexican
restaurant
its
nothing
great
but
its
the
best
mexican
beer
ive
ever
had
which
isnt
saying
a
great
deal
pleasantly
undemanding
i
guess
i
could
call
it
d
i
could
probably
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
though
im
seeing
it
as
more
of
a
meal
beer
its
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
and
the
mineral
taste
is
a
bit
rough
d
drinkability
is
exceptional
with
a
light
body
like
most
cerveceria
modelo
brands
good
drinkability
its
malty
yet
refreshing
and
quite
good
for
what
it
is
great
with
mexican
food
great
with
mexican
food
or
on
its
own
just
keep
the
limes
out
of
it
and
youll
be
good
great
for
chillin
on
a
midspring
night
with
a
fire
going
a
very
drinkable
dark
beer
and
much
better
than
most
hispanic
beers
i
take
this
every
time
over
any
other
mexicansouth
american
beer
unless
i
really
am
in
the
mood
for
a
corona
with
lime
i
know
its
lame
tasted
like
a
dark
budweiser
drinkable
but
at
least
worth
trying
when
eating
at
a
popular
mexican
restaurant
it
is
easily
drinkable
though
especially
paired
with
a
couple
margaritas
and
queso
because
it
matches
a
spicy
flavor
well
probably
one
of
the
better
south
of
the
border
beers
despite
the
lack
of
visible
carbonation
it
actually
felt
pretty
good
in
the
mouth
which
did
compensate
a
little
for
the
flat
taste
that
d
if
you
want
a
mexican
beer
this
one
beats
having
a
corona
order
this
one
and
the
resturant
staff
will
look
at
you
as
one
of
them
not
a
tourist
d
easy
to
drink
and
goes
well
with
mexican
food
its
usually
my
first
choice
at
a
mexican
restaurant
since
it
actually
has
some
flavor
d
this
is
my
default
beer
at
a
mexican
joint
i
can
drink
these
all
day
nothing
special
but
tastes
better
than
an
american
macro
or
corona
better
than
corona
in
my
opinion
equal
to
a
dos
equis
this
goes
down
smooth
and
its
easy
to
drink
definately
a
good
beer
to
have
when
youre
ready
to
pound
a
few
down
so
in
conclusion
this
beer
actually
tastes
pretty
good
against
all
odds
not
sure
about
the
carbonation
but
i
got
over
it
after
a
few
sips
d
a
decent
option
especially
when
at
a
mexican
restaurant
and
the
only
options
are
this
and
corona
i
also
disliked
the
foil
on
the
bottle
spent
to
much
time
trying
to
peel
the
foil
off
the
bottle
the
overall
taste
was
slightly
above
average
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
but
it
lagged
a
little
in
overall
to
light
a
mouthfeel
to
be
an
enjoyable
dark
beer
to
much
dark
malt
flavor
to
be
very
drinkable
i
am
sure
many
people
enjoy
this
beer
but
it
is
not
on
my
list
of
beers
to
try
again
sorry
but
this
was
a
drain
pour
its
about
the
lightest
tasting
darker
colored
beer
ive
ever
sampled
its
by
no
means
a
dark
beer
and
definitely
not
worth
the
near
2
i
paid
for
the
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
was
not
impressed
with
the
appearance
head
was
nonexistent
color
dark
amber
carbonation
was
slow
growing
smell
was
of
brown
sugar
mix
of
dark
malts
and
slight
hopped
background
taste
was
descent
nothing
impressive
flavor
similar
to
the
smell
more
pronounced
though
overall
decent
beer
i
would
say
very
drinkable
pretty
good
microbrew
rather
have
this
with
a
mexican
meal
then
a
corona
drinkability
amazing
with
tacos
spicy
foods
and
grilled
food
i
was
never
into
mexican
beer
but
negra
modelo
and
bohemia
have
impressed
me
a
lot
and
i
have
been
a
regular
customer
as
of
late
had
5
of
these
at
a
friends
house
along
with
a
bunch
of
appys
turns
out
this
a
real
food
friendly
vienna
with
enough
complexity
to
make
among
mexicos
best
beersthose
commercially
available
everwhere
in
na
the
caramel
notes
opened
up
when
the
beer
warmed
up
but
alas
this
beer
is
better
cold
as
some
of
the
flaws
in
the
finish
show
up
when
it
warms
all
in
all
a
decent
drinking
beer
this
is
not
intended
to
insult
the
many
mexicans
who
make
the
right
choice
it
is
just
a
very
generalized
view
that
some
upper
class
mexicans
have
i
really
could
not
prove
them
100
percent
right
or
wrong
md
decent
carbonation
and
very
crisp
not
a
bad
offering
at
all
from
the
mexican
beers
this
poured
a
dark
translucent
auburn
with
almost
no
head
it
didnt
have
much
of
a
fragrance
other
than
slightly
malty
it
tasted
like
malt
and
tap
water
a
dark
lager
with
typical
mexican
flavors
it
was
watery
and
a
little
carbonated
with
a
very
mild
aftertaste
overall
this
wasnt
offensive
to
drink
at
all
better
than
corona
and
dos
equis
but
it
didnt
do
much
for
me
either
since
most
of
the
mexican
restaurants
around
here
l
a
have
this
dos
equis
amber
or
bohemia
at
least
i
can
drink
something
thats
not
offensive
read
bmc
with
my
food
this
beer
held
true
to
my
standing
opinion
of
mexican
beers
i
cant
put
it
in
technical
terms
i
can
only
describe
it
as
mexican
flavor
i
dont
know
if
its
the
water
poor
quality
ingredients
or
the
heavyhanded
use
of
rice
or
other
adjuncts
this
beer
is
almost
good
but
not
quite
more
flavorful
and
satisfying
than
corona
but
still
not
something
id
return
to
ill
stick
with
beers
brewed
north
of
the
border
i
had
this
beer
at
a
local
mexican
restaurant
the
color
is
light
brown
with
some
reddish
tints
appearance
is
somewhat
dark
definitely
darker
than
any
other
mexican
beers
ive
had
the
head
was
impressive
about
a
finger
think
but
has
no
staying
power
smells
grainy
and
a
little
hoppy
with
notes
of
raisins
as
well
taste
is
grainy
as
well
some
roasted
malt
and
faint
hints
of
toffee
has
a
smooth
body
and
goes
down
with
a
pleasing
bitter
hop
finish
it
certainly
goes
without
saying
but
goes
well
with
mexican
dishes
i
was
a
lot
happier
with
it
when
my
food
finally
came
to
accompany
it
ordered
a
bottle
along
with
dinner
at
a
mexican
restaurant
on
comm
ave
last
saturday
night
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
doesnt
look
like
most
mexican
beers
as
its
a
dark
tan
color
vienna
lager
is
an
interesting
take
for
a
latin
brewery
no
head
at
all
and
lots
of
carbonation
a
bit
malty
on
the
tongue
it
tastes
just
like
most
easy
drinking
lagers
while
this
beer
is
nothing
special
at
least
instead
of
filling
up
on
fizzy
yellow
beers
and
enchilladas
you
can
fill
up
with
fizzy
brown
beers
something
different
to
drink
at
a
mexican
joint
so
its
not
all
that
bad
verdict
no
frills
here
this
is
just
a
nice
middleoftheroad
lager
for
people
who
like
their
beers
to
be
a
little
on
the
dry
side
d
quite
drinkable
with
the
right
food
not
my
first
choice
for
a
session
beer
a
pretty
good
bet
overall
drinkablity
easy
drinking
brew
good
flavor
balance
and
good
consistency
to
pair
with
dense
mexican
food
drinkability
paired
remarkably
well
with
combo
14
a
decent
mexican
lager
as
far
as
mexican
lagers
are
concerned
a
standard
at
most
grocery
stores
this
dark
austrian
lager
pours
with
a
tannish
head
the
body
is
amber
colored
with
an
aroma
of
malt
slight
spiciness
to
the
pallette
finishing
with
malt
dominance
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
and
very
little
mouthfeel
ok
in
a
pinch
d
i
remember
drinking
this
when
i
was
19
years
old
and
it
was
sold
as
an
ultra
premium
beer
at
a
nightclub
in
the
city
i
got
it
for
old
times
sake
and
was
actually
very
suprised
certainly
better
than
the
other
shit
these
guys
make
poured
a
transluscent
medium
brown
color
with
a
short
lasting
light
tan
head
smell
was
kind
of
skunky
malty
and
i
felt
like
i
was
even
smelling
alcohol
i
guess
at
6
i
may
have
been
now
that
i
think
about
it
taste
was
sort
of
alcoholish
bland
medium
caramel
maltiness
and
very
mexican
beer
tasting
not
that
good
but
drinkable
still
i
am
usually
overcritical
when
it
comes
to
imports
but
i
really
liked
this
one
perhaps
the
trip
from
mexico
doesnt
wreck
the
beer
like
the
trip
from
europe
does
its
a
nice
easy
to
drink
german
style
dark
lager
that
isnt
too
heavy
and
finishes
very
clean
no
off
flavors
to
speak
of
the
malt
character
is
dominant
but
not
obtuse
its
a
good
buy
overall
very
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
good
this
beer
was
d
an
ok
beer
certainly
what
i
would
order
in
mexico
poured
a
12
ounce
brown
bottle
into
a
16
ounce
pilsner
glass
this
one
is
dark
amber
in
color
with
not
very
much
head
the
smell
of
sweet
caramel
malts
dominates
the
aroma
tastes
very
nice
sweet
a
bit
of
spice
maybe
cloves
perfect
enchilada
beer
has
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
is
incredibly
drinkable
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
rich
and
big
per
style
drinking
like
a
octoberfest
bock
in
all
one
i
will
avoid
in
the
future
beer
should
be
a
better
accompaniment
to
any
meal
especially
a
good
spicy
mexican
dish
than
mere
postmeal
cascade
negra
modelo
is
a
letdown
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
taste
has
a
little
more
malt
than
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
however
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
vienna
lager
i
would
go
with
a
samuel
adams
because
it
had
a
lot
more
flavor
and
costs
a
lot
less
consistency
this
brew
is
an
exceptionally
consistent
its
basically
newcastle
south
of
the
border
its
a
good
brown
ale
with
hues
of
ruby
brown
tan
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
simple
but
is
slightly
complimented
by
honey
and
caramel
pretty
drinkable
for
a
dark
beer
this
is
my
favorite
mexican
restaurant
beer
next
time
youre
asked
que
quieres
tomar
make
it
a
negra
modelo
almost
no
body
in
the
aftertaste
the
red
fruits
the
maltiness
and
caramel
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
group
i
would
give
this
above
average
marks
for
taste
color
flavor
and
aroma
d
very
smooth
and
clean
tasting
beer
that
despite
its
stronger
alcohol
content
than
american
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
d
perfect
compliment
to
mexican
cuisine
but
a
very
average
beer
a
light
tasting
beer
with
a
darker
color
and
light
hop
presence
simple
but
pleasant
if
you
are
looking
for
a
mild
darker
beer
with
a
moderate
balance
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
this
should
hit
the
spot
have
knocked
back
quite
a
few
of
these
and
will
continue
to
do
so
when
out
i
was
enjoying
some
pretty
decent
mexican
food
along
with
this
brew
and
the
beer
was
a
good
fit
id
definitely
drink
this
again
maybe
next
time
ill
get
to
pour
it
into
a
glass
d
a
one
i
had
this
one
with
some
chile
chelas
it
was
yum
yum
it
wasnt
very
creamy
and
not
at
all
heavy
and
very
little
bitterness
made
it
easy
to
drink
note
an
average
vienna
lager
produce
by
mexican
but
you
can
still
enjoy
it
with
a
spicy
meal
like
thai
indian
or
mexican
as
well
this
is
a
good
beer
and
goes
well
with
beef
fajitas
and
tortilla
chips
d
i
can
easily
knock
back
a
cold
six
pack
of
these
too
bad
it
goes
for
14
99
for
a
six
pack
out
here
drinkability
not
a
bad
but
i
like
this
with
mexican
food
but
i
can
chill
and
drink
a
few
of
this
any
time
this
is
my
old
standby
in
mexican
restaraunts
i
thouroughly
enjoy
this
one
along
with
bohemia
the
taste
is
smooth
going
down
and
possibly
my
favorite
dark
beer
this
is
best
served
with
spicy
mexican
food
or
just
on
a
day
outside
in
the
heat
not
too
bad
by
any
means
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
thin
off
white
head
forms
settles
to
a
thin
layer
and
ring
few
lace
spots
kind
of
decent
looking
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
honey
bread
bit
of
floral
light
grains
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
very
light
some
corn
and
caramel
light
grains
sugar
very
bready
almost
biscuity
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
definitely
better
than
other
macro
lagers
overall
a
drinkable
brew
but
nothing
too
exciting
i
havent
had
this
for
a
long
time
and
was
expecting
more
smooth
full
body
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
by
far
the
best
of
the
mexican
beers
and
a
damn
fine
example
of
a
vienna
lager
an
easy
choice
when
amongst
limited
selection
i
recall
first
having
this
beer
at
xiaolongs
place
when
i
was
back
in
cali
one
of
them
in
the
house
brought
back
a
bottle
from
the
company
which
orders
that
beer
as
a
staple
back
then
i
was
not
yet
into
beers
and
the
only
craft
beer
i
have
ever
had
then
was
widmers
hefe
when
i
tasted
the
negra
modelo
i
was
actually
quite
impressed
i
was
sure
that
was
a
mark
above
most
macros
and
it
sure
was
i
also
recall
that
back
then
i
felt
that
the
bottle
looks
pretty
different
and
was
attractive
with
the
gold
foil
and
gold
yellow
label
since
my
venture
into
beers
i
have
been
trying
to
get
this
beer
again
but
to
no
avail
till
i
went
on
a
trip
to
hong
kong
i
saw
and
instanteneously
bought
a
bottle
of
the
negra
modelo
from
the
shopping
center
in
times
square
over
at
causeway
bay
hong
kong
i
placed
it
in
my
check
in
luggage
and
successfully
brought
it
back
to
singapore
together
with
a
sierra
nevada
stout
back
to
the
negra
modelo
i
served
it
in
my
sam
adams
globe
pint
glass
and
it
pours
out
red
brown
with
a
1
inch
thick
head
that
quicky
recedes
to
a
thin
and
clinging
layer
of
creamy
head
the
smell
was
mainly
malts
and
some
hops
aroma
the
malts
exuded
a
slightly
burnt
smell
the
taste
was
mainly
malts
as
well
and
slightly
hoppy
at
the
back
a
very
slight
burnt
maltiness
gives
it
a
dark
lager
kind
of
taste
though
not
exactly
but
not
as
exciting
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
some
hops
following
the
strong
malts
and
a
dry
finish
follows
the
after
taste
was
again
a
flood
of
rich
dark
malts
with
a
light
citrus
backing
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
a
creaminess
to
it
that
sets
it
apart
from
the
macros
smoothness
was
definitely
there
on
this
one
the
carbonation
starts
off
overly
strong
but
as
it
warms
carbonation
drops
considerably
this
beer
is
better
when
it
was
colder
do
not
let
it
sit
around
too
long
like
i
did
nice
smooth
texture
the
carbonation
is
pretty
fine
certainly
drinkable
a
nice
versatile
food
beer
matched
well
with
some
broiled
mackerel
smell
was
mostly
malt
caramel
and
toasted
taste
was
was
crisp
the
malt
is
upfront
with
a
hoppiness
behind
it
finishes
dry
mouthfeel
is
light
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
good
not
overly
strong
in
any
one
area
balanced
and
highly
enjoyable
actually
went
great
with
my
slightly
burned
veggie
burger
and
curly
fries
d
sessionable
the
beer
i
drank
the
most
while
in
mexico
availability
and
price
wise
total
bargain
i
remember
trying
and
liking
this
beer
about
10
years
ago
i
thought
id
try
it
again
and
review
it
this
time
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
ok
it
smells
like
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
aroma
but
has
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
too
its
a
good
beer
thats
not
offensive
has
a
decent
taste
to
it
and
is
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
this
beer
is
the
best
mexican
beer
that
i
have
had
i
guess
that
may
not
be
saying
much
but
its
better
than
your
typical
north
american
lager
this
is
the
best
mexican
beer
out
there
drinkabilty
was
very
good
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
taste
goes
very
well
drinking
out
of
a
pint
glass
or
straight
from
the
bottle
during
a
bbq
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
go
get
yourself
one
a
try
it
out
as
far
a
mexican
beer
goes
this
is
where
you
want
to
spend
that
12
00
having
said
that
id
rather
spend
10
00
and
get
4
lubo
barons
drinkability
nothing
to
look
for
nothing
to
actively
seek
out
inoffensive
and
drinkable
dan
easy
drinking
brew
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
a
good
choice
at
mexican
places
not
good
on
the
eyes
or
nose
it
does
play
well
with
a
good
mole
sauce
this
is
actually
the
mexican
beer
that
i
most
often
order
along
with
the
dos
equis
amber
when
dining
mexicali
ive
always
found
it
to
have
a
little
more
personality
than
most
corona
type
offerings
this
one
poured
a
brown
amber
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
fizzed
up
quickly
and
died
away
equally
fast
just
a
bit
of
lace
evident
the
aroma
is
not
too
strong
but
i
can
pick
up
malt
and
chocolate
along
with
some
grassy
bread
characteristics
most
of
these
same
qualities
remain
in
the
flavor
with
more
of
a
leaning
toward
the
grassy
side
this
one
was
not
very
well
carbonated
and
overall
a
bit
watery
the
finish
holds
the
bread
taste
along
with
some
slight
nutmeg
spice
generally
not
too
exciting
but
as
i
said
better
than
a
lot
of
choices
when
eating
at
pedros
cantina
goes
down
easy
something
thats
just
wrong
about
it
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
as
long
as
i
was
eating
along
with
it
smells
of
carmel
and
malt
nice
and
dark
malt
and
carmel
dominate
the
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
overall
quite
drinkable
nothing
too
complex
but
a
very
pleasant
flavor
and
widely
distributed
too
this
beer
has
often
saved
me
from
drinking
a
macro
d
being
a
sessionlike
beer
i
guess
it
could
be
easy
for
drinkability
but
it
doesnt
really
make
me
want
to
really
explore
it
more
one
is
plenty
this
is
a
decent
mexican
lager
way
better
than
corona
but
not
really
my
thing
smoky
toasty
aroma
with
a
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeelkinda
thin
but
enjoyablenice
creaminess
a
tinge
of
caramel
to
itnot
very
strong
but
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
i
like
this
one
very
much
and
will
have
it
again
and
again
a
good
beer
to
sit
down
and
relax
with
a
nice
beer
that
pours
a
dark
amber
color
but
little
to
no
head
the
caramel
scent
out
of
the
pour
excites
your
senses
into
anticipation
the
first
taste
comes
off
a
little
bit
malty
but
the
more
you
drink
the
more
caramel
flavors
hit
your
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
just
enough
carbonation
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
quality
beer
to
come
out
of
mexico
i
would
drink
this
agian
i
would
also
recomend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
it
d
all
in
all
the
best
beer
to
come
out
of
mexico
a
must
have
when
eating
mexican
foods
this
was
better
than
i
remembered
it
being
from
previous
tastings
not
that
it
is
exceptional
by
any
means
but
it
is
smoother
and
much
less
heinous
than
other
mexican
beers
tastes
of
caramel
and
light
coffee
aroma
and
mouthfeel
are
good
drinkability
of
this
is
high
d
this
is
my
choice
when
im
in
any
mexican
eatery
hands
down
its
a
step
above
your
typical
corona
and
besides
i
like
the
dark
beers
most
of
all
poured
this
one
and
the
head
dissolved
very
qquickly
the
color
was
dark
just
like
the
label
says
the
dark
was
a
dark
brown
and
had
a
nice
caramel
sweet
scent
to
it
the
taste
also
has
a
hint
of
this
and
is
actually
a
good
beer
this
one
is
not
like
the
other
mexico
beers
so
drink
in
moderation
i
was
actually
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
this
brew
not
to
say
it
was
great
but
it
was
definitely
drinkable
i
am
trying
to
get
into
some
darker
beers
and
this
seems
like
a
good
one
to
start
with
it
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
its
not
as
thick
a
black
as
i
guessed
it
would
be
the
smell
is
not
very
strong
but
theres
hints
of
nut
and
even
the
tiniest
hint
of
fruit
which
my
palate
could
not
quite
place
the
taste
went
right
along
with
the
smell
bit
nutty
with
a
wee
bit
of
fruit
a
tiny
bit
waterywhich
is
probably
what
made
it
so
drinkable
for
me
i
dont
like
watered
down
brews
dont
get
me
wrong
but
as
i
am
just
trying
to
get
into
some
dark
beersthis
made
for
an
easy
1st
step
there
was
a
smooth
finish
with
only
very
slight
bitternessthat
fades
quickly
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
i
picked
up
this
brew
because
a
group
of
my
friends
had
planned
a
mexican
theme
for
a
round
robin
dinner
party
a
round
robin
is
where
a
group
of
couples
cook
1
dinner
we
started
out
with
appetizers
at
one
couples
house
then
moved
on
to
soup
at
another
salad
at
another
the
entrée
at
another
and
so
on
i
thought
it
would
good
to
give
this
brew
a
try
and
i
will
certainly
indulge
again
d
goes
down
easy
but
its
not
good
enough
to
make
me
want
another
anytime
soon
drinkability
is
very
good
much
better
than
any
of
the
other
mexican
beers
i
have
tried
i
would
definitley
take
this
over
a
corona
any
day
d
one
of
the
better
mexcan
beers
i
think
vienna
lagers
are
the
best
kind
of
mexican
brews
anyway
overall
great
beer
the
only
mexican
beer
i
can
enjoy
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
good
representation
of
style
its
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
from
south
of
the
border
but
that
really
isnt
much
of
a
compliment
its
a
beer
worth
drinking
if
your
choices
are
limited
dpretty
decent
for
what
it
is
a
good
drinker
in
the
sun
despite
its
darker
color
works
as
a
quencher
but
also
has
more
flavor
than
most
mexican
beers
as
a
vienna
it
is
not
in
the
league
with
some
of
the
german
versions
but
ive
always
considered
the
mexican
viennas
a
different
beer
anyhow
ill
drink
this
again
this
seemed
to
be
the
beer
of
choice
for
the
locals
at
teh
resort
i
was
staying
at
it
poured
a
dark
amber
color
but
with
real
no
head
or
lacing
to
account
for
the
smell
was
fairly
malty
the
taste
was
fairly
malty
with
a
little
hint
of
hops
but
nothing
really
noticeable
the
taste
kidn
of
reminded
me
of
corona
a
little
bit
but
maltier
and
more
fullbodied
the
mouthfeel
was
okay
fullbodied
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
smooth
and
refreshing
it
was
nice
drinking
these
by
the
pool
pours
a
decent
amber
without
to
much
head
smells
malty
more
than
anything
in
the
mouth
its
def
the
malt
factor
not
over
powering
with
hints
of
raisins
and
an
acidic
bite
not
super
hyped
on
this
beer
but
its
decent
drinking
a
dark
somewhat
malty
lager
with
its
own
little
character
d
pretty
nice
goes
good
with
mexican
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
smooth
out
and
complement
a
spicy
dish
drinkability
i
could
definetely
drink
anywhere
between
one
and
ten
of
these
and
have
a
good
time
thats
the
logic
i
use
to
decide
how
drinkable
a
beer
is
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
decent
head
faint
lacing
smells
of
caramel
and
malt
sweet
malty
taste
in
an
average
to
slighty
above
average
lager
light
mouthfeel
in
a
decently
drinkable
beer
goes
great
with
nearly
anything
on
the
menu
in
a
mexican
restaurant
as
viennastyle
lagers
go
its
average
at
best
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
mexico
drinkable
and
it
has
flavor
pairs
well
with
any
mexican
dish
but
i
like
with
extremely
spicy
foods
it
seems
to
calm
the
fire
while
still
being
able
to
appreciate
the
brew
got
this
one
at
a
mexican
restaurant
in
the
hopes
it
might
be
a
little
better
than
the
rest
of
the
crap
they
had
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
little
light
tan
head
on
top
even
a
little
bit
of
lacing
as
the
beer
pours
nose
is
fairly
mild
with
some
hints
of
malt
and
some
grain
like
the
flavor
malty
throughout
with
caramel
and
some
roasted
hints
just
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
feel
is
average
standard
body
for
a
lager
overall
i
liked
this
one
much
better
than
dos
equis
presidente
or
corona
although
im
not
sure
if
that
counts
as
a
mexican
beer
will
definitely
get
this
one
again
the
next
time
im
at
a
mexican
restaurant
d
this
is
a
fine
beer
for
a
cinco
de
mayo
party
or
at
mexican
restaurants
where
little
else
is
available
not
bad
at
all
pours
out
a
red
tinted
dark
iced
tea
color
with
some
active
carbonation
in
the
body
and
a
12
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
some
ringed
lacing
i
smell
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
some
graininess
but
this
is
pretty
faint
in
the
nose
overall
the
taste
is
mostly
a
vague
cane
syrup
like
sweetness
with
hints
of
dark
malts
and
grain
finishes
with
a
bit
of
tealike
hops
finish
has
a
mild
tanninlike
astringency
that
i
like
carbonation
isnt
to
prickly
on
the
tongue
and
this
has
a
bit
more
body
than
modelo
especial
can
get
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
considering
its
from
a
mexican
macro
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
you
can
find
in
the
states
still
it
i
a
very
drinkable
beer
sessionable
not
filling
tastes
ok
id
buy
it
again
to
pair
with
mexican
food
but
thats
about
it
spritzy
corona
with
caramel
coloring
added
as
vienna
lagers
go
this
is
a
real
disappointment
though
i
do
admit
it
was
highly
drinkable
it
looked
like
i
poured
a
can
of
coke
in
the
glass
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
mild
smell
of
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
taste
was
mostly
bubbles
very
watery
with
a
mild
roasted
malt
flavor
sadly
this
was
disappointing
but
not
unexpected
given
the
sister
brews
from
modelo
would
i
grab
for
one
at
a
mexican
restaurantespecially
outside
on
the
deck
in
the
sunshine
yes
but
id
never
buy
this
to
drink
at
home
so
many
better
vienna
lagerstyle
beers
to
try
one
from
boston
beer
co
being
a
good
start
it
was
cinco
de
mayo
and
i
was
in
rome
so
i
did
as
all
the
other
romans
in
the
mexican
restaurant
and
enjoyed
a
real
mexican
beer
viva
la
cerveza
gets
avg
points
for
appearance
just
because
it
is
dark
and
i
dont
even
tend
to
favor
beers
this
dark
fizzy
head
very
faint
aromas
for
a
dark
beer
can
detect
some
roasty
and
metallic
notes
starts
and
finishes
dry
and
crisp
no
thick
malt
sweetness
very
light
in
body
like
a
guinness
not
much
going
on
to
speak
of
no
noticeable
hops
this
probably
looks
scary
to
most
people
but
there
are
not
many
actual
beer
flavors
to
worry
about
pours
a
perfectly
clear
smoky
hazelnut
color
no
head
to
speak
of
smell
is
so
faint
maybe
because
its
so
cold
straight
from
the
cooler
at
krogers
there
is
a
hint
of
very
light
beer
in
there
taste
is
very
crisp
quaffable
excellent
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
bet
slight
hops
but
mainly
a
sweetness
sticking
around
overall
fairly
light
though
good
mouthfeel
not
sticky
and
good
carbonation
a
pleasant
surprise
i
remember
having
this
a
few
years
ago
and
dont
recall
any
strong
feelings
either
way
at
a
restaurant
with
a
short
beer
list
this
seemed
like
the
best
bet
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
average
aroma
some
sweet
grain
caramel
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
i
thought
it
went
well
with
spicy
food
definitely
a
good
choice
among
the
other
bmc
options
at
this
restaurant
very
smooth
beer
for
the
dark
beer
lover
light
feeling
beer
with
the
good
overall
taste
very
drinkable
beer
especially
with
a
good
side
mexican
dish
i
will
sure
have
this
brew
again
great
little
beer
to
try
not
worth
a
whole
6
pack
but
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
it
out
to
eat
or
as
a
single
its
worth
it
its
a
copperreddish
brown
beer
with
a
fairly
sweet
aroma
balanced
by
a
light
hop
flavor
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
average
not
heavy
but
not
light
perfectly
suitable
for
the
warm
mexican
climate
as
it
holds
some
taste
and
goes
down
without
trouble
kind
of
a
mexican
sam
adams
if
you
want
a
fair
approximation
and
thats
not
bad
went
well
with
my
steak
taquitos
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
and
given
the
choices
on
the
menu
this
was
probably
the
best
choice
and
fit
the
theme
of
the
restaurant
too
but
not
something
id
choose
to
buy
in
another
context
not
bad
at
all
id
visit
this
one
again
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
going
on
if
had
to
choose
between
this
or
a
corona
id
choose
negra
modelo
everytime
this
would
be
good
for
a
light
summer
day
or
when
there
arent
any
session
beers
available
as
the
5
40
abv
can
hardly
be
discerned
here
i
dont
look
back
on
this
now
with
the
same
affection
that
i
felt
years
ago
but
for
mexican
beer
its
about
as
good
as
it
gets
maybe
i
need
those
chips
back
for
what
is
ultimately
a
macro
this
is
not
a
bad
effort
must
have
a
lime
and
generous
salt
pour
but
the
taste
is
still
good
can
easily
have
as
part
of
a
session
maybe
4
or
5
at
least
i
dont
know
what
is
going
on
with
this
beer
its
unimpressive
in
ever
category
with
very
little
flavor
not
recommended
i
would
rather
drink
an
american
macro
lager
which
any
example
of
an
aml
actually
seems
to
have
more
flavor
than
this
not
bad
decently
tasty
quite
refreshing
i
dont
think
id
seek
out
another
but
if
offered
i
would
gleefully
accept
overall
impression
one
of
my
favorites
when
im
out
for
mexican
food
or
in
mexico
i
dont
care
what
the
hardcore
beer
snobs
say
about
this
one
ill
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
and
if
there
happens
to
be
a
lime
in
there
down
it
goes
best
if
served
very
cold
12oz
brown
bottle
brown
translucent
body
with
just
a
film
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
fruit
alcohol
roasted
and
caramel
malt
tastes
sweeter
than
expected
with
apple
or
pear
roasted
and
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
chocolate
even
no
real
bitterness
to
speak
of
though
theres
some
hop
there
but
just
enough
to
offset
the
maltiness
and
sweetness
of
the
brew
taste
is
surprisingly
pleasing
and
complex
with
many
different
components
ballancing
the
others
lighterbodied
making
for
a
rather
drinkable
beer
surprisingly
good
helps
redeem
my
opinion
of
mexican
beers
d
i
tend
to
lump
this
in
with
dos
equis
in
that
the
only
time
i
drink
either
is
when
im
at
a
mexican
restaurant
and
i
choose
one
or
the
other
negra
modelo
is
darker
than
xx
not
as
sweet
a
bit
more
herbal
and
cleaner
in
the
finish
xx
while
not
hoppy
is
hoppier
than
this
choose
accordingly
i
guess
i
enjoy
both
when
im
out
at
a
mexican
place
but
never
keep
them
around
at
home
drinkability
dull
and
boring
is
all
that
can
describe
this
beer
not
worth
trying
negra
modelo
pours
a
chestnut
brown
color
with
very
little
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
truly
classic
packaging
imho
theres
a
lightly
fruity
aroma
the
flavor
is
on
the
sweet
side
malt
dominates
not
your
typical
mexican
beer
not
a
bad
substitute
for
a
macro
this
cerveza
pours
a
dark
brown
with
decent
white
head
little
head
retention
but
it
thins
out
nicely
not
too
mention
of
a
smell
but
a
bit
light
tending
toward
bitter
its
flavor
is
as
lighter
than
expected
with
a
subtle
malty
sweetness
and
crisp
taste
this
drinks
well
as
is
an
excellent
companion
to
a
spice
mexican
meal
in
fact
my
number
one
choice
for
this
cuisine
very
drinkable
if
the
salsa
is
flowing
and
the
chips
are
fresh
clean
very
slightly
fruity
aroma
general
lack
of
aroma
appropriate
for
the
style
brilliant
clarity
in
a
pale
tea
colored
brown
beer
with
a
small
but
tight
offwhite
head
maltiness
up
front
subdued
and
immediately
balanced
by
the
hop
bitterness
my
sample
may
have
been
a
bit
oxidized
as
had
some
cardboard
notes
very
high
carbonation
in
a
fairly
light
bodied
beer
a
middle
of
the
road
easy
drinking
beer
nicely
balanced
with
a
fairly
clean
finish
but
would
like
more
malt
character
and
complexity
one
of
the
first
nonbmc
beers
i
can
remember
trying
in
my
youth
and
still
a
standby
at
mexican
restaurants
when
actually
served
in
a
glass
instead
of
the
usual
bottle
you
can
appreciate
the
dark
brown
color
with
very
little
head
not
much
aroma
a
little
sweet
if
anything
flavor
is
a
lttle
malty
but
no
dominant
ingredient
fairly
bubbly
quite
a
drinkable
beer
not
one
id
set
out
to
specifically
buy
but
a
good
choice
over
corona
thin
but
carbonated
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
and
with
much
more
flavorful
than
your
typical
macro
especially
your
typical
mexican
macro
one
of
the
few
that
dont
need
a
lime
to
add
a
bit
of
flavor
definitely
drinkable
either
with
a
spicy
mexican
dinner
in
the
backyard
or
on
its
own
tasted
like
a
dark
budwiser
drinkable
but
not
worth
trying
what
is
worth
trying
is
the
populr
mexican
cocktail
that
it
can
make
its
called
a
la
michelada
and
contains
worcestershire
sauce

the
aroma
was
the

thing
i
noticed
it
was
a
defined

on

the
color
was
a

the
brew
was

its

the

im
impressed
this
is
a
decent
pseudo
vienna
from
mexico
from
the
brewer
of
corona
of
all
things
go
figger
as
pleasant
a
surprise
as
this
was
ingredients
to
juice
it
up
semidisappointing
given
my
high
expectation
overall
its
pretty
bland
although
with
some
decent
merits
as
well
for
what
i
paid
for
it
i
dont
feel
ripped
off
for
once
but
it
was
also
a
one
time
deal
for
me
theres
nothing
going
on
here
to
bring
me
back
for
more
and
those
empty
bottles
will
be
filled
with
something
more
tasty
some
time
soon
metallic
character
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
bready
malt
sweetness
in
the
start
and
the
finish
with
a
slight
balancing
hoppiness
relatively
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
body
above
average
but
forgettable
adios
amoebas
very
healthy
beer
recommended
one
of
my
few
mexican
favorite
brews
cheers
overall
it
didnt
wow
me
but
next
time
im
in
a
mexican
restaurant
which
is
not
often
i
might
have
this
if
i
want
a
beer
instead
of
a
margarita
its
certainly
better
than
the
other
mexican
beers
ive
had
esp
corona
and
sol
a
nice
beer
although
is
isnt
really
much
of
anything
special
about
it
besides
that
its
one
of
the
only
mexican
beers
around
here
thats
decent
tastes
darker
than
most
vienna
lagers
almost
bocklike
with
smooth
chocolate
malt
flavor
no
detectable
hops
just
a
smooth
drinking
mexican
beer
that
goes
nicely
with
a
big
burrito
feels
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
lower
carbonation
levels
seem
appropriate
for
the
style
this
is
a
beer
that
ill
probably
buy
again
however
i
dont
know
how
soon
i
would
like
to
try
others
of
this
same
style
first
ill
probably
almost
definitely
buy
it
again
on
next
cinco
de
mayo
the
beer
is
good
and
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
replay
value
except
for
cinco
de
mayo
mouthfeel
is
slightly
bubbly
with
a
medium
body
that
slips
along
the
plate
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
head
leaves
a
little
film
but
no
lace
the
smell
expresses
a
strong
malty
backbone
along
with
a
significant
amount
of
corn
adjuncts
the
taste
also
hits
you
up
front
with
its
maltiness
but
also
finishes
strong
with
the
adjuncts
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
what
you
would
expect
from
the
style
overall
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
out
there
certainly
one
to
look
for
first
at
a
restaurant
bham
uk
tried
while
in
tampa
fl
may
2006
served
with
a
meal
at
abuelas
mexican
resturaunt
in
kc
had
to
request
a
nonfrosted
glass
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
discarded
the
lime
wedged
onto
the
rim
dark
clear
amber
color
hardly
any
head
no
lace
slight
musty
malt
smell
taste
is
salty
with
a
touch
of
citrus
light
watery
mouthfeel
overall
my
impression
is
eh
i
think
i
prefer
dos
equis
dark
when
eating
mexican
food
lately
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
different
beers
for
the
last
few
years
ive
been
eyeing
this
beer
down
the
other
night
i
said
wtf
ill
try
it
i
grabbed
just
one
out
of
a
six
pack
dam
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
12
pack
what
a
great
beer
pours
great
with
a
decent
head
though
not
as
nice
a
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
ale
however
if
you
are
looking
to
try
a
new
beer
definitely
add
this
one
to
your
list
youll
love
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
scant
khaki
head
fading
to
a
soapy
coating
nose
is
light
with
hints
of
caramel
malt
and
musty
barley
taste
starts
with
a
peppery
bite
falling
into
a
roasted
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
metallic
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
simple
light
and
damned
refreshing
with
a
spicy
mexican
meal
better
than
i
remembered
interesting
that
it
says
dark
ale
on
the
label
yet
its
classified
as
a
vienna
lager
mistake
in
the
database
or
the
label
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
they
really
suprised
me
as
when
i
picked
them
up
i
wasnt
expecting
much
overall
the
best
beer
mexico
has
to
offer
negra
modelo
gets
an
r
for
ridiculous
presentation
the
slots
in
the
sixpack
holder
are
slightly
too
big
for
the
bottles
which
are
strange
stubby
bottles
that
have
gold
foil
covering
the
neck
and
cap
the
pour
is
brownamber
with
a
frothy
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
the
nose
has
caramel
malts
slightly
herbal
hops
and
a
hint
of
strawberry
andor
cherry
the
taste
is
along
those
lines
but
the
flavors
are
more
difficult
to
pull
out
by
themselves
and
there
is
a
mild
coronalike
saltiness
this
is
definitely
the
best
mexican
beer
that
ive
ever
tasted
and
its
the
next
best
thing
to
a
good
margarita
at
a
mexican
restaurant
salud
d
perfect
this
beer
goes
down
easy
which
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
as
i
was
eating
fryed
jalapenos
and
spicy
enchladas
perfect
with
a
mexican
meal
this
one
might
never
really
receive
the
credit
its
due
nor
might
the
munich
dunkel
style
but
ill
continue
to
reach
for
this
one
time
and
time
again
in
the
right
situations
this
is
also
one
of
my
regular
beers
when
the
lady
and
i
visit
siesta
key
in
florida
negra
modelo
is
great
nice
way
to
celebrate
cinco
de
mayo
great
beer
from
mexico
this
brewery
also
makes
a
great
bohemian
pilsner
overall
a
pretty
darned
good
dark
lager
recommended
a
great
dark
beer
i
recommend
with
any
mexican
cuisine
please
please
please
do
not
put
a
lime
in
this
beer
it
is
fine
without
it
this
beer
says
dark
ale
but
it
doesnt
have
tha
ale
lingering
aftertaste
to
it
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
when
dining
out
at
a
mexican
restaurant
when
poured
the
color
was
of
a
medium
light
brown
clear
with
very
little
foam
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hops
was
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
and
mild
hops
and
the
finish
was
very
dry
being
a
dry
finish
it
would
be
a
great
thrist
quincher
on
hot
summer
days
easy
to
drink
and
cooling
on
a
hot
day
not
a
subtle
beer
but
has
some
pleasantly
clean
flavors
and
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
usual
watery
mexican
pilsner
imitations
of
the
typical
mexican
beer
choices
at
most
mexican
restaurants
this
dos
equis
and
corona
id
choose
this
over
the
others
beyond
that
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
overall
id
say
this
one
of
a
few
mexican
beers
i
would
choose
to
drink
nothing
special
about
it
at
all
though
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
only
beer
i
will
drink
in
mexico
it
tastes
sweet
and
leaves
your
mouth
with
no
unpleasent
aftertaste
it
has
a
mellow
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
always
my
first
pick
over
the
other
dark
beers
that
you
would
find
at
your
local
supermarket
speaking
of
style
beeradvocate
lists
it
as
a
vienna
lager
and
many
people
have
referred
to
it
as
a
lager
but
on
the
bottle
it
refers
to
itself
as
a
dark
ale
it
will
be
on
the
front
of
the
label
below
and
to
the
right
of
the
name
odd
d
not
bad
starts
off
a
bit
weak
but
it
picks
up
halfway
through
glass
very
drinkable
much
better
flavor
than
some
of
the
other
popular
mexican
beers
opinion
well
i
have
been
on
a
mission
tonight
to
try
all
of
the
commercial
vienna
lagers
available
to
me
and
this
one
has
been
the
best
so
far
it
has
a
noticeable
toasty
malt
presence
that
was
lacking
in
other
examples
a
vienna
beer
isnt
huge
but
i
would
have
liked
to
have
had
a
bit
more
of
the
malt
presence
that
there
was
here
without
the
dark
caramel
flavors
if
i
were
to
make
a
suggestion
to
the
brewer
it
would
be
to
use
lighter
colored
crystal
malts
no
roast
and
maybe
substitute
a
bit
of
munich
for
some
of
the
vienna
malt
still
this
is
a
pretty
approachable
beer
if
youre
in
mexico
though
it
isnt
bad
choice
bohemia
is
better
but
this
is
a
good
second
choice
one
of
the
best
beers
from
mexico
and
im
glad
that
its
available
in
maine
and
fairly
easy
to
find
pours
a
clear
brown
caramel
color
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
but
not
overwhelming
taste
is
a
sweet
malt
flavor
not
overpowering
but
there
very
little
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
not
too
watery
overall
its
very
drinkable
i
like
this
this
is
the
first
time
in
a
while
ive
had
negra
modelo
will
have
to
buy
this
more
often
its
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
as
a
session
beer
or
refresher
or
a
nice
night
cap
too
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
mexican
cuisine
and
this
beer
is
my
favorite
to
compliment
it
just
dont
let
them
put
a
lime
in
it
it
completely
kills
the
decent
tastes
that
are
in
there
drinkability
not
offensive
but
nothing
special
i
seem
to
recall
a
time
when
nm
was
in
fact
darker
more
fullbodied
and
fullflavored
this
could
just
be
my
revisionist
memory
or
it
could
be
because
relative
to
all
that
bmc
it
actually
does
have
those
traits
i
will
let
the
public
decide
12
oz
foiled
cap
bottle
pored
into
a
mug
it
pours
a
pretty
nice
dark
red
with
some
orange
hightlights
good
white
head
with
good
retention
the
smell
is
light
roasted
malts
and
a
slight
spicey
tang
to
it
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
little
hint
of
hop
bitterness
a
little
too
watery
though
tastes
a
lot
better
room
temp
then
cold
id
say
this
is
now
my
favorite
mexican
beer
its
nothing
special
but
still
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
a
steak
quisadilla
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
like
i
said
great
with
mexican
its
delicious
flavor
and
widespread
availablilty
makes
it
a
mainstay
at
hip
los
angeles
parties
i
e
the
ones
i
go
to
i
think
this
would
make
a
great
beer
for
fussy
people
to
like
course
i
hate
starting
someone
on
something
like
this
especially
if
theyre
going
to
be
philistines
about
it
or
thats
the
only
beer
theyll
like
which
would
be
odd
d
well
if
youre
at
a
mexican
place
and
the
only
choices
available
are
your
standard
mexican
brews
corona
pacifica
carta
blanca
etc
and
you
see
negra
modelo
on
the
list
get
it
its
a
decent
representation
of
the
vienna
style
one
of
the
few
commercial
examples
i
know
of
really
this
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
brown
color
into
my
way
overchilled
mug
i
had
to
wait
several
minutes
for
the
beer
to
warm
up
before
my
first
taste
the
smell
is
malty
and
a
little
nutty
also
taste
is
quite
good
for
a
mega
brewery
with
notes
of
chocolate
caramel
and
malty
sweetness
there
is
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
but
not
much
at
many
mexican
restaurants
this
is
the
only
decent
beer
on
the
menu
worth
a
try
m
d
mouthfeel
is
ok
for
this
dark
lager
not
very
heavy
malts
but
they
are
the
only
flavor
you
get
great
session
beer
especially
if
you
are
at
a
mexican
restuarant
or
in
mexico
on
the
beach
goes
perfect
with
a
burrito
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
thin
creamy
head
that
fades
away
to
a
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
a
little
malty
and
a
little
yeasty
but
very
faint
slightly
estery
the
taste
is
very
sweetmalty
some
roast
coffee
flavor
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
or
bitterness
just
enough
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
finish
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
with
a
little
carbonation
scraping
of
the
tongue
all
in
all
its
very
drinkable
good
finish
good
flavor
but
not
too
strong
easily
a
session
beer
by
far
the
best
beer
i
had
on
my
trip
to
mexico
which
sadly
isnt
saying
much
i
cant
believe
the
same
people
that
make
corona
make
something
this
good
i
highly
recommend
it
this
is
only
example
of
a
vienna
lager
ive
had
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
the
usual
lager
head
the
malt
flavors
are
pretty
simple
and
taste
like
caramel
a
little
and
it
has
a
typical
german
lager
understatedbalanced
hop
flavor
has
a
slight
taste
of
yeast
which
i
tend
to
appreciate
so
as
to
know
that
im
drinkin
a
beer
decent
beer
i
dont
know
how
much
it
is
but
assuming
that
it
has
to
compete
with
other
more
popular
mexican
beers
its
dark
and
it
is
a
macro
the
price
is
probably
reasonable
ill
definitely
pick
some
up
the
next
time
i
have
nachos
its
a
good
dark
lager
and
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
smelling
a
bit
sweet
this
is
a
really
smooth
beer
to
drink
also
smooth
creamy
sweet
carmel
taste
when
it
first
goes
in
and
the
warm
rising
of
vapors
from
the
back
of
my
tongue
a
moment
after
and
lasting
a
bit
just
a
little
bitterness
but
this
is
mostly
a
smooth
sweet
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
ive
always
thought
this
beer
was
a
little
underappreciated
and
maybe
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
perhaps
i
just
love
the
flavor
of
vienna
malt
maybe
negra
modelo
isnt
the
best
in
its
style
but
its
crisp
and
has
a
nice
vienna
malt
character
and
flavor
another
thought
has
to
do
with
freshness
im
reviewing
it
now
from
southern
arizona
and
wonder
if
the
freshness
diminishes
as
it
travels
further
from
its
home
it
seems
a
bit
better
here
than
up
north
drinkability
lime
not
necessary
nor
wanted
probably
the
best
beer
from
mexico
that
i
have
had
worth
a
try
particularly
when
eating
mexican
food
when
poured
from
the
bottle
the
deep
garnet
beer
raises
a
short
tan
head
of
loose
bubbles
that
disappears
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
there
was
no
lacing
and
only
a
few
excited
carbonation
lines
the
smell
is
sweet
and
vaguely
roasted
but
mainly
clean
the
sweetness
comes
through
up
front
and
is
followed
by
some
nice
hops
crispness
leaving
the
palate
ready
for
the
next
drink
the
carbonation
is
vibrant
and
the
body
is
relatively
light
pairs
well
with
the
food
at
my
local
mexican
restaurant
and
is
quite
drinkable
i
like
wellcrafted
balanced
beers
and
negra
modelo
is
one
of
my
favorites
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
moderatestrength
dark
lager
i
think
this
beer
suffers
imagewise
from
its
association
with
other
mexican
beers
which
are
mostly
lets
face
it
swill
if
it
was
called
modelobräu
and
imported
from
germany
its
score
would
jump
much
higher
i
drank
this
out
of
an
oversized
wine
glass
it
poured
a
translucent
dark
amber
color
the
head
was
small
and
had
little
lacing
it
had
a
coffee
smell
with
hints
of
toffee
not
too
malty
to
my
taste
somewhat
sweet
maybe
brown
sugar
nice
carbonation
with
a
sort
of
thin
mouthfeel
it
is
overall
an
ok
mexican
beer
better
than
most
i
have
had
one
great
thing
is
that
the
bottles
are
good
for
home
brewers
they
are
an
interesting
shape
and
reseal
well
no
real
hop
flavor
but
a
decent
amount
of
malt
overall
this
is
an
eh
beer
i
like
it
all
right
but
dont
buy
it
for
home
consumption
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
nice
bottle
presentation
too

gold
wrapper
and
a
quality
look
pours
an
odd
shade
in
color
highly
transparent
yet
very
dark
brown
it
has
an
off
white
fizzylooking
head
the
smell
is
carmelly
and
malty
initial
taste
is
great
very
malty
and
quite
refreshing
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
of
a
letdown
as
it
moves
towards
a
bready
yeast
taste
the
high
levels
of
carbonation
hide
the
thin
mouthfeel
id
give
this
beer
an
average
drinkability
much
better
than
the
typical
mexican
pale
lagers
the
only
mexican
beer
besides
dos
equies
that
id
get
at
a
mexican
restaraunt
poured
into
a
plastic
water
cup
at
qdoba
how
authentic
negro
modelo
smelled
and
tasted
like
a
typical
lager
all
sweet
maltiness
except
for
a
hint
of
a
medicinalbandaid
quality
in
the
taste
the
flaw
wasnt
enough
to
drag
it
down
too
much
but
it
wasnt
going
anywhere
other
than
average
anyway
on
the
plus
side
the
queso
chicken
burrito
i
had
was
excellent
what
this
beer
lacks
in
complexity
it
graciously
allows
the
food
to
accomplish
and
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
a
lot
of
beers
drinkability
high
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
negra
since
i
used
to
drink
it
at
my
favorite
burrito
place
in
chapel
hill
and
it
was
an
aftermorning
exam
goto
beer
still
its
fairly
plain
and
generic
this
is
a
pretty
good
vienna
lager
and
possibly
my
favorite
mexican
beer
it
is
supposedly
not
an
allmalt
brew
and
while
that
hurts
the
character
somewhat
it
also
makes
it
highly
quaffable
this
comes
in
handy
when
it
is
paired
with
copious
amounts
of
spicy
mexican
food
as
it
was
meant
to
be
i
try
this
beer
in
the
party
of
my
birthday
is
very
good
when
is
frozen
in
ice
bar
only
not
have
the
same
properties
of
the
presentation
on
bottle
but
its
fight
to
gain
my
admiration
like
a
beer
on
tap
its
brewery
put
much
attention
in
its
delivery
carefully
installed
its
system
of
tap
notes
easily
sessionable
nice
flavor
this
could
be
a
nice
transition
beer
for
the
girls
or
pussies
crisp
and
refreshing
dark
colour
but
a
little
clear
although
it
has
a
good
name
in
mexico
the
truth
it
is
sometimes
mistaken
between
a
vienna
and
a
dark
lager
i
think
it
is
both
but
it
is
considered
a
strong
beer
here
that
means
that
the
efforts
wont
be
further
not
because
of
the
brewery
but
because
of
the
consumers
not
as
complex
as
sam
adams
lager
but
more
approachable
and
more
drinkable
in
my
book
it
is
a
simple
smooth
beer
easy
to
drink
and
great
at
a
ballgame
with
the
chips
and
salsa
more
character
than
your
normal
watered
down
cerveza
notes
very
good
by
itself
or
with
any
mexican
food
highly
drinkable
i
found
this
beer
very
drinkable
especially
with
food
but
not
bad
alone
either
it
goes
down
easy
quenches
spicy
spots
in
the
mouth
and
stays
good
to
the
last
sip
to
rip
off
maxwell
house
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
ruby
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
topped
by
a
frothy
though
quickly
disappearing
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
light
herbal
character
fruitiness
strawberries
that
seem
to
be
mostly
hop
derived
as
expected
the
aroma
is
fairly
muted
subtle
the
beer
is
lightly
sweet
with
apparent
notes
of
sweet
cherry
candy
and
light
caramel
the
beer
has
a
light
herbal
character
and
a
certain
light
astringent
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
fairly
simple
and
subtle
but
that
is
pretty
characteristic
of
this
style
of
beer
this
beer
really
has
a
soft
spot
for
me
and
i
quite
enjoy
being
able
to
order
this
beer
at
mexican
restaurants
where
it
is
usually
the
only
beer
with
flavor
this
is
drinkable
but
boring
beer
i
wouldnt
look
for
this
but
if
it
were
handed
to
me
i
could
enjoy
it
anyway
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
with
very
good
clarity
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
are
dense
and
retain
well
small
patches
of
weak
lacing
will
remain
toasted
vienna
and
amber
malt
nose
hint
of
noble
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
with
dextrine
and
crisp
with
pilsener
and
a
vienna
malt
flavor
rounds
it
all
out
medium
body
with
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
and
ample
dextrins
giving
it
a
smooth
mouthfeel
mild
hallertau
or
perle
hop
aftertaste
cleanses
the
palate
although
it
its
a
bit
too
obvious
however
a
residual
sweet
finish
makes
for
an
otherwise
decent
balance
with
above
average
drinkability
fora
mexican
beer
i
have
yet
to
find
one
better
a
nice
dark
lager
with
and
plush
white
head
and
some
lacing
make
sure
you
are
not
served
with
a
lime
as
this
will
interupt
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
smells
clean
like
a
good
lager
but
i
pick
up
a
little
maltyness
and
grain
the
taste
is
a
clean
lager
with
a
bit
of
chocolaty
caramel
notes
tossed
in
with
a
background
bitterness
it
is
smooth
drinking
and
your
best
bet
at
a
mexican
joint
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
grainy
mouthfeel
not
as
bad
as
i
anticipated
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
but
it
particularly
stood
out
recently
looks
brown
with
mohogony
and
golded
high
lights
pours
a
rich
loose
head
that
is
just
off
white
smells
toasty
malty
and
a
little
like
butter
popcorn
tastes
malty
clean
hopped
only
for
balance
in
flavor
and
bittering
a
little
bready
buttery
toffee
like
creamy
body
that
remains
quite
soft
finishes
sweet
and
clean
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissapates
almost
instantly
smell
is
lightly
sweet
malt
slightly
fruity
esters
and
a
diacetyl
background
taste
is
a
clean
graniness
with
a
hint
of
buttery
diacetyl
pretty
standard
mexican
dark
lager
better
than
corona
or
corona
clones
for
sure
i
would
pick
this
if
they
didnt
has
dos
equis
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
also
and
it
wasnt
bad
either
looked
pretty
and
the
olfactory
elements
came
together
to
make
it
a
very
crisp
refreshing
beer
with
just
the
meresty
touch
of
adjunct
it
had
enough
quality
going
on
to
make
it
worthwhile
and
man
they
go
down
smooth
and
they
go
down
plentiful
and
best
of
all
now
i
know
what
i
have
waiting
for
me
when
i
go
to
playa
del
carmen
later
this
month
it
may
not
be
great
but
it
certainly
does
its
job
which
means
it
brings
something
decent
to
the
taste
table
and
it
quenches
nicely
a
great
dark
mexican
beer
it
is
a
dark
chocolately
brown
color
very
smooth
texture
with
a
full
body
flavor
and
has
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
taste
to
it
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
robust
beers
to
ever
come
out
of
mexico
i
guess
its
not
known
as
the
cream
of
beer
for
nothing
although
there
is
not
a
lot
going
on
here
for
some
reason
this
is
my
favorite
out
of
all
the
mexican
beers
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
enjoy
every
one
it
washes
down
the
chips
and
salsa
the
fajitas
the
enchiladas
and
anything
else
you
want
to
put
in
front
of
us
a
definite
session
beer
for
these
two
texans
poured
a
deep
chocolatey
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
nice
rich
malty
aroma
bready
and
nutty
the
flavor
is
clean
and
malty
a
nice
toasted
bread
with
some
bitterness
and
hints
of
hops
a
clean
finish
with
light
body
this
beer
is
very
well
made
and
highly
drinkable
a
nice
summer
alternative
to
all
those
yellow
beers
not
the
best
in
the
world
but
a
pretty
good
offering
from
mexico
easy
drinking
but
still
relatively
flavorful
dont
put
a
lime
in
it
i
will
defenitly
skip
this
one
the
next
time
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
easy
to
have
3
to
5
with
dinner
and
after
it
instead
of
a
tequila
best
if
icy
cold
overall
this
went
down
pretty
smooth
and
drinking
a
few
with
dinner
was
very
easy
pours
a
wonderfully
clear
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
squat
head
aroma
is
mostly
dms
cooked
corn
aroma
some
stale
grain
going
on
flavor
is
slighty
malty
sweet
but
the
cooked
corn
rears
its
ugly
head
during
the
taste
as
well
there
isnt
a
ton
of
flavor
going
on
either
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
under
carbonated
if
im
desperate
id
go
for
this
it
might
match
well
with
greasy
mediocre
mexican
food
but
not
a
standalone
beer
for
me
overall
impression
a
pretty
mild
taste
i
have
fond
memories
of
this
beer
but
sitting
to
review
it
im
just
not
being
blown
away
the
taste
is
very
neutral
and
somewhat
bland
but
clean
drinkability
would
be
enhanced
with
a
good
plate
of
enchiladas
but
overall
not
bad
not
great
dark
amberbrown
with
a
creamy
tightbubbled
light
sandy
head
smells
of
clean
toasted
grain
with
light
malty
sweetness
and
a
whiff
of
hops
tastes
of
light
toasted
malts
some
nuttiness
sodaish
sweetness
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
mostly
sweetish
and
caramelly
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
what
i
usually
order
at
a
mexican
restaurant
that
doesnt
have
a
great
beer
menu
my
usual
choice
for
mexican
restaurants
while
not
exemplary
in
any
way
it
sure
as
hell
doesnt
suck
either
its
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
and
compared
to
the
alternative
mexican
brews
offered
at
my
local
taqueria
im
certain
to
ask
for
a
negra
modelo
again
the
sweetness
and
medium
body
works
very
well
as
a
compliment
to
spicy
food
much
better
than
some
of
the
other
bitter
or
watered
down
lagers
from
that
region
not
too
bad
and
definately
something
that
goes
well
with
chicken
and
steak
fajitas
pours
a
translucent
coppery
brown
with
a
bigbubbled
head
that
does
not
last
long
there
is
a
faint
malty
smell
but
nothing
overpowering
like
most
american
lagers
taste
is
sugary
without
being
cloying
a
little
hop
presence
tries
in
vain
to
balance
things
out
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
more
than
likely
due
to
the
big
bubbles
this
beer
is
meant
for
mass
consumption
with
enchiladas
and
carne
asada
load
up
a
tortilla
with
your
favorite
mexican
or
texmex
foods
and
try
one
of
these
sans
lime
they
are
a
nice
match
as
intended
drinkability
probably
one
of
the
best
things
this
beer
has
going
for
it
something
about
it
urges
you
to
have
another
if
it
wasnt
for
the
higher
price
id
drink
this
occasionally
imo
this
is
the
best
massproduced
brew
to
come
out
of
mexico
it
pours
a
nice
medium
amber
with
a
brilliant
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
it
has
a
nice
light
caramel
malty
aroma
with
some
grain
and
tealike
hops
a
bit
of
adjunct
sweetness
comes
through
but
theres
enough
malt
to
compete
with
it
slightly
bitter
taste
with
caramel
and
adjunct
sweetness
that
is
more
prevalent
in
the
taste
the
finish
is
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
maltiness
a
great
session
dark
brew
that
pairs
well
with
spicy
fare
12
oz
bottle
very
odd
shape
with
gold
foil
top
and
a
code
printed
on
the
glass
pours
into
the
pint
glass
a
chestnut
color
with
a
1
finger
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
nice
looking
thin
blanket
of
foam
but
little
lace
smell
is
metallic
with
sweet
malt
adjuncts
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
tastes
are
subtle
hops
malts
and
a
bit
of
caramel
much
more
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
mexican
beer
pretty
refreshing
i
could
see
it
pairing
well
with
mexican
food
or
being
a
decent
session
beer
there
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
the
head
settles
to
a
offwhite
lace
the
taste
and
smell
is
very
sweet
and
malty
nothing
is
over
powering
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
spicy
food
all
around
this
is
an
average
dark
lager
drank
from
bottle
with
authentic
mexican
meal
a
light
beer
with
dark
color
describes
this
munich
dunkel
lager
pretty
well
nose
negligable
maybe
better
in
glass
i
tasted
roasted
malt
and
some
hops
in
finish
good
carbonation
i
will
order
another
with
my
next
chimichanga
platter
drinkability
very
nice
aftertaste
makes
you
long
for
more
drinkability
is
very
high
i
have
had
this
many
times
before
and
will
continue
to
quaff
it
better
on
tap
duh
but
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
honestly
one
of
the
few
mainstream
lagers
i
buy
without
hesitation
also
a
good
brew
to
get
those
i
wont
drink
dark
beer
people
to
try
comments
not
bad
but
not
great
i
think
it
is
worth
a
try
but
when
it
comes
to
buying
a
six
pack
i
will
pick
something
else
when
you
are
at
a
party
and
everything
else
is
swill
this
beer
is
worth
drinking
i
wanted
to
dislike
this
beer
but
it
was
better
than
expected
overall
better
than
average
much
better
than
corona
i
could
imagine
putting
away
one
or
two
of
these
with
a
chimichanga
platter
or
burrito
and
they
would
go
quite
well
together
this
is
my
mexican
beer
of
preference
when
at
a
mexican
restaurant
and
faced
with
the
typical
mexican
beer
selection
this
beer
will
work
with
just
about
any
mexican
dish
carbonation
is
good
maybe
a
bit
too
bubbly
for
some
good
solo
when
thirsty
for
a
better
than
average
mexican
beer
but
also
goes
well
with
spicy
mexican
fare
consumed
in
october
2004
in
cancun
mexico
from
a
bottle
ahhhh
a
very
nice
beer
pours
an
amber
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
and
not
much
lacing
smells
of
deep
dark
malt
maybe
some
nutty
scents
and
a
few
hops
too
tastes
a
bit
nutty
also
definite
hops
slightly
spicy
hops
and
a
bit
sweet
at
the
same
time
this
would
be
the
number
one
beer
to
get
if
having
a
nice
dinner
south
of
the
border
maybe
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
me
but
an
overal
pretty
good
beer
ask
for
this
one
first
and
grab
it
if
its
there
first
of
all
i
poured
this
horribly
and
the
head
lasted
much
longer
than
typical
nice
lacing
and
color
glad
to
know
there
is
a
very
drinakble
beer
to
order
at
most
mexican
restaurants
mouthfeel
was
nice
but
the
placed
served
it
with
a
frosted
mug
no
smell
to
really
to
speak
about
however
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
beers
in
a
given
evening
this
is
one
of
my
regular
beers
one
that
i
buy
more
often
than
almost
any
other
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
but
its
the
best
one
i
can
find
on
a
regular
basis
that
costs
in
the
7sixpack
range
i
generally
favor
dark
beers
not
too
bitter
and
negra
modelo
fills
the
bill
reliably
i
would
describe
the
taste
as
clean
and
slightly
rich
and
it
goes
down
easily
if
you
like
dark
beers
you
wont
go
wrong
with
this
one
nice
dark
beer
that
poured
a
decent
lasting
head
smell
had
a
hint
of
nut
and
roasted
malt
taste
had
a
hint
of
toasted
caramel
malts
and
a
smooth
hop
free
finish
mouthfeel
was
fairly
full
and
lively
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
has
been
my
mexican
beer
of
choice
for
a
number
of
years
now
i
wanted
something
different
and
there
werent
an
abundunce
of
choices
so
i
thought
id
give
this
a
try
a
no
frills
beer
light
lemony
malty
flavor
and
a
bit
dry
i
ordered
it
before
the
meal
not
sure
how
it
would
have
gone
with
dinner
but
im
not
about
to
order
another
one
to
find
out
wasnt
terrible
but
one
was
enough
for
me
the
beer
is
sort
of
sweet
caramels
and
lightly
roasted
malts
has
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
finishes
very
clean
not
a
hop
to
speak
of
sometimes
tastes
slightly
spicy
which
makes
me
think
of
a
weaker
saison
worth
a
few
and
it
stands
head
and
shoulders
above
anything
else
youll
get
in
the
texmex
joints
in
all
not
a
complex
brew
and
less
hoppy
than
historically
but
from
the
mainstream
mexican
breweries
this
would
be
one
of
the
best
and
my
sentimental
favorite
and
what
can
i
say
but
it
goes
well
with
some
spicy
chile
verde
drinkability
very
good
good
session
brew
especially
in
the
warm
weather
which
i
assume
is
what
they
had
in
mind
given
that
its
mexican
beer
not
bad
at
all
abv
is
5
3
poured
out
brownish
in
color
not
too
dark
really
off
white
head
that
left
minimal
amounts
of
lacing
fizzy
carbonation
taste
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
a
very
flavorful
brew
sweet
in
the
beginning
but
finished
dry
and
a
little
bitter
end
hada
slight
alcohol
taste
as
well
went
down
alot
smoother
that
any
other
offering
i
have
had
from
modelo
what
kept
my
interest
in
this
beer
was
its
drinkability
very
smooth
and
easy
to
put
down
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
fantastic
beer
worth
a
try
i
believe
this
is
very
mild
beer
almost
watery
but
with
a
nice
dark
touch
pours
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
that
leaves
very
little
lace
clear
amber
color
light
medium
bodied
but
slightly
watery
finish
and
light
carbonation
multisweet
nose
starts
sweet
finishes
mellow
the
abv
is
5
3
7
99
for
a
6pack
of
12oz
bottles
available
everywhere
in
nh
yet
another
mediocre
beer
that
gets
praise
from
macro
drinkers
for
the
simple
fact
its
from
mexico
not
really
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
its
not
a
good
beer
but
its
not
at
al
offensive
a
bit
watery
and
flavorless
there
is
a
touch
of
carmel
flavor
hops
are
non
existant
may
be
a
good
choice
for
my
next
trip
to
mexicantown
for
dinner
pours
a
deep
translucent
reddishbrown
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
but
theres
a
bit
of
caramel
maltiness
in
there
not
much
else
going
on
in
the
smell
taste
is
characterized
by
a
roasted
semisweet
malt
flavor
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
as
well
its
not
heavy
hopped
is
light
in
body
and
had
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
id
say
that
this
is
a
middleoftheroad
dark
lager
beer
its
nothing
special
but
its
agreeable
and
nicely
drinkable
my
memory
of
negra
modelo
since
it
hasnt
entered
my
mouth
in
many
years
is
that
it
went
pretty
well
with
mexican
food
i
doubt
that
id
feel
the
same
now
that
im
more
wellversed
in
the
ways
of
beer
ordinary
at
best
parting
thoughts
in
texas
this
beer
is
easily
availiable
but
seems
a
tad
bit
too
expensive
considering
how
close
we
are
to
mexico
still
negra
modelo
is
well
worth
the
price
and
should
be
tried
by
those
who
want
a
good
mexican
beer
dark
but
translucent
brown
color
with
nearly
no
head
smells
like
roasted
barley
and
a
hint
of
toffee
very
light
in
body
lots
of
carbonation
but
strangely
no
real
flavor
almost
an
insipid
lager
there
is
a
gesture
of
smoothness
underlying
the
strong
overlay
of
bitterness
not
an
offensive
beer
but
not
a
satisfying
one
either
my
favorite
mexican
beer
actually
has
some
decent
flavors
and
goes
well
with
mexican
food
brown
ale
like
in
appearance
head
shrank
away
but
left
a
few
wisps
of
lace
sweetish
tinged
malty
aroma
nice
malty
sweet
taste
that
hides
the
additives
well
does
not
taste
as
corn
riddled
as
do
the
lighter
mexican
beers
is
a
decent
drinkable
beer
when
considering
its
relatives
a
hands
down
choice
when
in
a
mexican
restaurant
and
there
are
no
micros
to
choose
from
this
is
my
favorite
mexican
and
perhaps
my
favorite
beer
from
the
southern
americas
hard
to
call
this
a
dunkel
lager
but
it
does
have
some
complexity
of
tastes
that
place
it
far
above
corona
carib
and
red
stripe
dark
copper
in
color
with
a
tight
offwhite
head
that
quickly
turns
into
a
thin
sheet
and
leaves
little
lace
clean
aroma
with
hints
of
sweetness
and
light
toasted
grain
flavor
can
best
be
described
as
a
light
vienna
lager
some
sweetness
toasted
malt
and
caramel
are
present
but
muted
light
in
body
crisp
and
dry
this
beer
seems
like
it
is
trying
it
wants
to
be
flavorful
but
just
cant
get
there
ill
take
this
over
a
corona
anyday
disappointing
thin
macro
taste
and
mouthfeel
not
much
flavor
and
a
strange
overly
carbonated
body
i
enjoyed
this
more
when
i
was
watching
the
mosleydelahoya
fight
in
a
bar
full
of
mexicanamericans
at
home
below
average
still
better
than
corona
oelergud
this
was
a
tasty
beer
it
poured
a
dark
red
color
with
a
small
head
that
did
not
last
long
the
smell
was
very
malty
and
sweet
quite
inviting
the
flavor
was
quite
good
with
a
nice
strong
malt
backbone
and
a
pinch
of
hop
bitterness
reminded
me
of
a
watered
down
double
bock
in
some
respects
anyways
it
went
well
with
my
fish
tacos
and
i
would
drink
this
one
again
if
it
were
available
poured
a
ruddy
brown
no
haze
at
all
offwhite
head
formed
and
very
slowly
receded
to
lace
smell
is
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
hint
of
noble
hops
malty
sweetness
is
very
prevalent
the
taste
hits
with
chocolate
malts
at
the
beginning
then
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
fades
with
a
decent
noble
hop
finish
something
isnt
quite
right
with
the
hops
but
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
it
it
isnt
unpleasant
its
disconcerting
its
not
right
but
it
isnt
dead
wrong
either
just
odd
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
will
certainly
wash
down
the
dryest
of
chimichangas
had
this
brew
at
a
well
known
mexican
restaurant
in
queens
dark
brown
body
with
a
thin
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
smell
was
mildly
hoppy
with
a
light
herbal
aroma
i
was
surprised
by
the
taste
i
was
expecting
a
lot
less
from
a
mexican
import
it
was
very
malty
and
roasty
light
and
easy
drinking
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
have
definately
had
another
if
i
stayed
at
the
restaurant
a
little
longer
this
beer
poured
a
clear
light
coffee
brown
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
to
a
thin
coat
the
smell
was
malty
with
some
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
was
a
nottoosweet
caramel
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
yeast
and
breadiness
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
creamy
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
kick
overall
it
was
nicely
malty
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
sampled
from
mexico
compared
to
other
mexilagers
ive
had
this
one
is
probably
the
most
solid
still
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
if
i
was
choking
on
my
chimichanga
it
would
be
passable
to
wash
it
down
with
this
not
too
bad
its
working
well
with
my
spicy
food
slightly
heavy
i
actually
dont
usually
enjoy
this
beer
with
mexican
food
as
it
seems
to
injure
the
taste
as
well
as
fill
the
stomach
a
little
too
much
not
overly
exciting
enough
to
drink
on
its
own
and
not
refreshing
enough
for
a
summers
day
best
as
a
companion
to
more
interesting
food
if
this
were
the
only
beer
on
a
mexican
restaurant
menu
along
with
other
modelo
offerings
and
dos
equis
id
choose
it
would
go
great
with
chicken
enchiladas
in
green
sauce
mmm
enchiladas
cute
squat
bottle
with
a
waist
where
the
neck
ends
the
cutest
one
ive
seen
so
far
impressive
rich
looking
packaging
in
a
unique
squat
bottle
with
gold
foil
over
the
neck
and
cap
poured
a
reddish
clear
amber
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
receded
very
quickly
to
a
scant
ring
smell
is
quite
malty
as
is
the
taste
carmel
malt
taste
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
clean
dry
finish
goes
very
nicely
with
mexican
food
and
is
a
nice
change
from
the
corona
or
dos
equis
i
might
usually
have
with
such
fare
not
a
great
beer
but
nice
and
enjoyable
the
negra
modelo
poured
a
reddish
copper
with
an
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
a
thin
layer
and
had
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
slightly
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
and
a
little
citrus
it
had
a
pretty
mild
flavor
with
a
medium
body
the
taste
is
nutty
caramel
malts
up
front
with
a
slight
bitter
acidic
finish
overall
its
much
better
than
the
other
mexican
beers
ive
had
but
still
a
little
off
compared
to
a
quality
microbrew
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
fat
tire
it
was
raining
this
morning
so
my
buddy
came
over
with
a
sixer
of
negra
modelo
it
poured
a
dark
amber
copper
colour
with
a
minimal
head
the
scent
was
malty
with
slight
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
also
very
malty
lacking
of
hops
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
from
the
makers
of
corona
i
was
atually
impressed
with
it
to
an
extent
usually
my
dad
and
i
dont
like
the
same
sort
of
beers
but
he
introduced
me
to
this
one
and
i
liked
it
it
poured
a
dark
clear
amber
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
disipated
what
i
liked
about
this
beer
is
that
it
had
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
it
had
a
great
malt
character
sweet
nutty
and
caramelly
it
didnt
have
a
lot
of
hoppiness
to
it
just
a
subtle
hoppy
aroma
to
it
it
seemed
to
have
as
much
character
as
a
oktoberfest
style
beer
i
first
tried
this
beer
in
cancun
and
i
was
really
impressed
because
i
was
used
to
taste
modelo
beers
that
were
freezing
and
had
limes
i
e
corona
but
this
beer
for
my
tastes
was
actually
pretty
good
its
apperance
is
very
appealing
a
darkish
brown
with
a
frosty
head
that
seesm
to
disipate
fast
good
caramel
taste
and
some
prononuced
hints
of
malt
they
carry
these
at
the
local
mexican
restaurant
and
everytime
we
eat
there
i
have
to
have
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
tan
head
head
doesnt
last
to
long
but
leaves
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
malts
and
a
hop
blast
a
hint
of
roasted
caramel
the
taste
is
sorta
citrus
flavor
with
malt
characteristics
feels
full
but
a
little
dull
in
the
mouth
a
drinkable
beer
great
when
eating
mexican
very
drinkable
try
it
next
time
you
eat
enchiladas
no
nose
to
speak
of
minimal
malt
very
minimal
hops
very
subtle
in
the
flavor
dept
a
bit
chalky
in
the
finish
not
very
pleasing
i
would
not
waste
too
much
time
on
this
stuff
unless
there
was
only
macros
around
might
do
decently
with
food
but
thats
probably
a
stretch
this
beer
is
decent
and
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
the
only
better
beer
around
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
pair
with
spicy
food
not
terribly
complex
but
still
pretty
decent
refreshing
and
inoffensive
a
better
choice
than
the
typical
bud
parade
of
offerings
gracias
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
a
nice
hop
bite
on
the
back
end
of
the
palate
crisp
and
refreshing
especially
in
hotter
weather
slightly
watery
in
mouthfeel
and
it
seems
to
get
a
little
bitter
after
it
warms
a
bit
this
is
a
beer
that
is
probably
at
its
best
when
quaffed
cold
paired
with
salty
or
hot
foods
good
drinkability
maybe
a
good
session
beer
if
you
want
to
try
a
south
of
the
border
taste
take
my
advice
though
go
find
a
nice
out
of
the
way
taquieria
and
order
you
up
a
big
plate
of
texmex
lay
down
a
couple
of
these
while
youre
munching
on
your
chips
and
salsa
and
you
will
feel
like
youre
right
in
the
heart
of
mexico
city
a
much
better
mexican
beer
than
corona
and
goes
so
well
with
mexican
compliments
the
salsa
and
chips
im
having
right
now
not
many
better
to
compliment
mexican
and
id
probably
have
this
one
again
very
plain
beer
in
my
opinion
was
a
dark
color
almost
black
no
head
what
so
ever
smell
was
the
slightest
amout
of
malt
not
much
of
a
hop
smell
taste
was
malty
almost
roasted
with
very
little
hop
taste
very
thin
almost
watery
beer
kinda
bland
i
thought
it
is
easy
to
drink
roasty
smooth
dark
ale
that
goes
great
with
mexican
food
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
uncomplicated
but
nicely
done
a
good
bet
for
a
session
or
for
breaking
up
2
more
complicated
brews
nothing
special
but
nothing
bad
and
it
gets
the
job
done
great
alternative
if
the
only
others
are
coronatecate
appearance
is
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
aroma
was
of
weak
malts
and
barely
a
hops
presence
tastes
of
sweet
malts
and
a
tinge
of
dryness
at
the
end
thin
beer
with
a
slightly
butteriness
high
drinkability
leads
to
a
very
good
dinner
beer
and
can
also
pass
as
a
session
beer
i
really
like
that
the
beer
while
not
bursting
with
flavor
has
a
nice
taste
that
doesnt
give
you
too
much
to
deal
with
while
youre
eating
a
meal
a
nice
palate
cleanser
like
hens
teeth
in
australia
now
but
if
i
know
im
off
to
the
cantina
im
always
hoping
negra
modelo
is
on
the
beer
list
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
little
hoppy
with
some
small
hints
of
malt
but
nothing
very
strong
the
body
is
pretty
thin
this
one
was
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
a
mexican
beer
and
i
liked
it
better
than
a
lot
of
the
other
mexi
beers
ive
had
nothing
too
wonderful
to
point
out
in
the
taste
but
it
is
enjoyable
beer
had
a
nice
dark
amber
hue
to
it
nothing
like
an
oatmeal
stout
almost
like
a
bock
head
didnt
stay
around
too
long
nice
smell
a
little
corn
a
little
hops
nothing
over
powering
good
taste
bolder
than
the
typical
mexican
lager
nothing
amazing
about
the
mouthfeel
average
a
good
beer
ok
to
try
one
or
maybe
two
with
dinner
but
thats
about
it
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
before
this
beer
isnt
half
bad
but
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
it
could
you
a
few
hops
to
balance
out
the
flavor
not
bad
for
a
mexican
beer
trumps
most
of
their
lighter
offerings
however
i
just
did
not
find
it
that
interesting
toffee
and
malt
flavors
are
readily
present
but
thats
about
as
far
as
the
complexity
goes
beer
is
smooth
the
drink
if
i
were
in
mexico
this
would
probably
be
my
session
beer
as
i
prefer
it
over
all
the
other
lager
type
beers
ive
had
from
there
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
not
so
much
a
dark
beer
as
a
strong
mr
pibb
but
im
glad
to
have
finally
found
a
dark
beer
that
i
could
drink
on
a
bright
sunny
day
refreshing
if
lacking
in
style
poured
nicely
into
my
pint
a
starting
cap
of
foam
was
thick
but
dissolved
quickly
into
a
light
rim
around
the
glass
the
beer
is
dark
amber
and
looks
similar
to
an
iced
tea
aroma
is
somewhat
sour
malty
with
a
roundness
that
can
only
be
explained
by
hops
though
they
arent
that
apparent
taste
is
somewhat
plain
slight
amber
flavor
sweet
draw
and
flat
lagery
finish
drinks
like
an
avarage
lager
despite
the
difference
in
color
medium
dark
brown
color
small
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
sweet
a
medium
bodied
dark
ale
malts
are
slightly
sweet
hops
are
light
and
mild
mild
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
malty
dark
amberish
pour
quickly
disappearing
head
soft
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
fruit
and
hopsnice
soft
smooth
flavor
very
lightly
carbonated
flavor
just
a
little
timid
but
probaly
the
best
thing
available
in
a
mexican
resturant
would
complement
a
spicey
salsa
nicely
this
beer
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
is
better
than
corona
but
thats
not
saying
much
not
really
that
dark
for
a
dark
lager
roasted
taste
with
a
light
caramel
roastiness
to
boot
very
lightly
carbonated
but
goes
down
smooth
enough
all
in
all
not
a
great
beer
but
decent
enough
drinkability

it
was
a
little
clumsy
going
down
for
me
but
this
is
hands
above
other
mexican
ales
that
ive
had
and
quite
a
respectable
offering
by
modelo
a
beer
from
mexico
that
can
be
considered
a
good
beer
it
is
a
bit
of
a
brown
color
fair
amount
of
head
the
aroma
is
malty
there
is
almost
a
complete
absence
of
hops
a
decent
body
and
malty
flavor
although
both
could
be
a
bit
more
no
bitterness
at
all
darkness
is
deceiving
ng
found
one
of
these
in
the
fridge
left
over
from
a
party
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
color
hardly
any
head
to
speak
of
despite
a
vigorous
pour
there
is
an
odd
odor
here
rotten
fruit
do
i
have
a
skunky
bottle
tastes
malty
and
of
metal
metal
flavor
seems
to
have
control
head
is
already
gone
after
two
sips
bottle
says
its
a
dark
beer
it
looks
like
a
dark
beer
but
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
a
good
dark
lager
beer
very
malty
in
the
mouth
finishes
with
a
definite
sweet
note
really
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
without
food
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
or
some
hop
bitterness
to
balance
all
of
that
malt
and
give
some
more
interest
still
a
nice
food
match
with
rich
mexican
stews
etc
and
my
tipple
of
choice
at
most
mexican
restaurants
finally
a
mexican
brew
thats
not
afraid
of
a
little
grain
this
dark
ruby
brew
gives
off
a
rich
malt
aroma
eventhough
the
head
quickly
disapears
as
with
most
lagers
the
taste
is
of
light
hops
and
spice
this
beer
has
a
solid
feel
in
my
mouth
with
a
malt
finish
will
look
forward
to
this
the
next
time
im
eating
mexican
the
smell
is
really
a
treat
though
conjuring
illusions
of
mirthful
drinking
sessions
around
a
campfire
in
the
high
sierra
pozole
and
beans
bubble
in
the
middle
of
the
light
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
with
an
appetite
as
its
relatively
dilute
character
will
serve
well
as
a
wash
for
sticky
tastebuds
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
lacey
head
the
smell
is
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
there
is
something
about
these
mexican
beers
that
smells
funny
they
all
have
it
the
taste
is
much
the
same
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
crystal
malts
but
there
is
that
zing
that
stays
with
you
after
you
drink
it
its
not
a
bad
quality
its
just
distinctive
the
mouthfeel
is
average
there
is
a
medium
body
all
qualities
aside
this
is
an
enjoyable
import
from
south
of
the
border
a
good
drinking
beer
copper
colored
medium
head
not
all
that
much
there
slight
hop
and
malt
character
a
bit
of
a
metallic
feel
to
it
slightly
smoky
at
the
end
still
a
good
session
beer
and
infinitely
better
than
that
corona
swill
good
with
spicy
mexican
food
this
beer
poured
a
small
tan
head
with
smallmedium
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
the
body
was
clear
and
the
hue
was
brown
the
nose
of
this
beer
was
fruity
and
there
was
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
i
found
this
beer
to
have
a
bitter
aftertaste
beer
is
easy
to
pair
with
food
and
may
be
my
favorite
southoftheborder
choice
easy
to
drink
with
a
fair
mouthfeel
cheers
this
is
negra
modello
pours
a
rather
reddish
and
very
dark
brown
tone
with
a
thick
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
behind
as
it
fades
but
is
consistent
much
carbonation
is
present
the
smell
is
very
acute
and
citrusy
with
malt
present
the
taste
with
an
appealing
bitterness
and
some
sweet
presence
is
good
and
has
a
comfortable
moutfeel
and
a
consistent
body
a
good
mexican
beer
this
is
my
favorite
mexican
beer
the
beer
comes
in
a
stubby
12
ounce
brown
bottle
and
pours
about
the
same
color
as
the
bottle
it
has
a
very
fine
white
head
that
complement
the
dark
liquid
the
aroma
is
very
light
not
much
in
either
malt
or
hops
the
taste
leans
toward
maltiness
by
comparison
to
other
mexican
beers
this
ones
taste
is
almost
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
the
carbonation
does
bite
a
little
on
the
tongue
i
recommend
this
beer
with
whatever
your
favorite
mexican
restaurant
is
serving
remember
the
mexicans
are
keeping
the
vienna
lager
style
alive
and
well
not
a
bad
mexican
beer
head
and
shoulders
above
corona
or
corona
light
decent
beer
that
does
not
require
the
addition
of
a
lemon
or
lime
in
addition
this
beer
is
not
bad
as
it
warms
a
bit
carbonation
is
good
but
not
overdone
to
be
honest
could
not
really
detect
an
attributable
scent
with
this
beer
would
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
beer
no
but
i
would
order
the
next
time
i
am
having
mexican
food
pours
an
amber
brown
hue
with
a
moccha
tan
toned
head
and
this
beer
has
a
nice
full
two
fingered
head
forming
as
the
lace
forms
it
is
evenly
trickled
around
the
rim
very
nice
appearance
the
aroma
is
slightly
floral
maybe
some
hop
aroma
there
with
very
sweet
malty
sharp
tones
and
some
grainy
cereal
notes
are
also
present
the
taste
is
slightly
caramel
with
a
tingling
malty
sweetness
thats
balanced
by
some
mild
bittering
hops
some
fruit
tones
were
also
present
but
nothing
that
completely
stood
out
to
me
medium
body
with
a
nice
smooth
creamy
texture
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
tickles
the
back
of
the
throat
very
well
conrstucted
mexican
delight
that
i
am
sure
pairs
very
well
with
some
spicy
mexican
food
much
better
than
your
average
mexican
fizzy
yellow
beer
this
beer
is
not
complex
in
anyway
and
was
surprisingly
lighter
in
flavor
than
what
i
was
expecting
however
this
makes
it
the
perfect
beverage
to
order
at
any
mexican
restaurant
as
long
as
its
not
tainted
with
lime
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
am
so
glad
its
around
because
i
have
something
to
drink
at
mexican
restaurants
for
gods
sake
what
would
i
drink
if
it
wasnt
available
corona
carta
blanca
tecate
aghhh
good
with
mexican
food
but
not
on
its
own
its
dark
brown
with
just
a
hint
of
red
unlike
most
mexican
beers
hops
are
actually
detectable
in
the
smell
also
a
slight
sweetness
is
present
in
the
smell
the
flavor
supplies
a
nice
twang
that
also
sets
it
apart
from
its
mexican
compatriots
the
tangy
sweetness
becomes
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
a
bit
if
you
find
yourself
in
mexico
it
makes
a
nice
change
from
the
others
its
also
worth
picking
up
at
home
especially
if
youre
entertaining
friends
who
are
predisposed
to
mexican
brews
thanks
to
janice
who
spent
all
summer
traveling
in
mexico
and
brought
back
quite
a
load
of
beers
to
drink
nearly
a
suitcase
full
what
a
great
gal
i
asked
if
she
could
get
me
a
few
well
she
just
happened
to
like
most
of
them
and
really
wanting
to
bring
some
back
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
the
same
type
of
head
youd
see
on
a
coke
that
is
it
fizzes
up
and
disappears
very
little
aroma
even
at
warmer
temps
my
dear
olefactory
senses
detect
a
bit
of
a
used
tea
bag
smell
to
it
pretty
standard
malty
sweetness
with
just
a
bit
of
a
palate
cleansing
bitterness
at
the
end
a
fairly
crisp
easy
finish
definitely
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
something
to
look
for
and
cling
to
when
your
bastard
friends
drag
you
out
to
bars
where
molson
is
the
premium
beer
and
absolut
is
the
good
stuff
still
i
would
much
prefer
this
beer
to
most
of
the
macrobrews
that
are
available
in
the
us
it
did
not
venture
far
into
positive
territory
but
it
also
avoided
negative
territory
completely
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
most
of
our
massproduced
beers
i
would
not
buy
it
but
if
i
ended
up
in
a
restaurant
or
party
where
this
and
only
this
was
available
i
would
not
despair
id
be
ok
i
had
this
with
mexican
in
dana
point
california
and
found
it
to
go
well
with
the
food
our
local
friends
said
they
stock
it
exclusively
in
their
fridge
the
appearance
was
very
nice
a
virtually
clear
very
dark
amber
or
light
reddish
brown
filled
the
glass
there
was
an
offwhite
head
and
just
a
bit
of
lacing
the
beer
was
mostly
malty
in
taste
and
smell
with
some
grain
sense
coming
through
against
the
spicey
food
a
bit
thin
and
watery
but
pleasant
enough
for
the
evening
a
mexican
dark
beer
almost
transparent
with
an
extremely
deep
red
color
no
head
and
fairly
carbonated
but
thin
bubbles
appears
a
little
thick
but
drinks
very
thin
has
a
faint
sugar
and
nut
nose
the
bitterness
is
slightly
softened
has
an
earthy
flavor
that
is
slightly
nutty
and
a
roasted
malt
without
the
typical
sugar
or
coffee
tones
some
slight
hop
taste
easy
to
drink
with
not
muc
of
a
mouthfeel
its
probably
low
in
alcohol
and
goes
very
well
with
spicy
food
but
thats
about
all
with
it
try
this
instead
of
corona
when
youre
across
the
border
presented
in
12oz
stubbie
bottle
with
gold
foil
over
top
i
sampled
this
brew
with
some
enchiladas
and
refried
beans
poured
a
dark
amberorange
color
with
a
medium
rocky
head
which
faded
down
quickly
leaving
virtually
no
lace
nose
is
malty
with
subtle
pepper
undertones
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
touch
of
mild
hops
that
fade
away
quickly
even
thought
this
is
an
slightly
above
average
mexican
beer
its
by
far
much
better
than
corona
very
drinkable
with
nice
fresh
made
mexican
foods
which
is
were
i
drink
this
usually
well
its
a
bit
better
than
tecate
and
a
whole
lot
better
than
the
c
wordreidrovermar
07
over
brownishamber
liquid
lightly
molassessweet
and
malty
nose
taste
is
a
brief
wash
of
malt
followed
by
some
pinprickly
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
dryness
and
minute
hoppiness
nothing
to
see
here
this
little
special
to
me
bocklike
brew
is
my
choice
chilidogjan
24
foamy
white
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
however
perhaps
the
a
couple
of
drops
of
the
lime
wedge
had
dropped
in
a
la
buffalos
own
mighty
taco
a
legend
in
the
region
if
you
ever
accidentally
find
yourself
in
buffalo
and
im
happy
about
it
this
is
a
great
session
beer
as
it
goes
down
like
an
amber
ale
but
without
ale
charecteristics
smooth
so
smooth
while
my
taste
has
changed
more
often
than
venom
will
change
diapers
the
next
few
years
it
still
is
a
semiregular
in
my
dbf
deep
garnet
in
color
the
head
is
light
chocolate
but
dissipates
a
bit
quickly
the
lace
is
adequate
nose
is
malt
light
hints
of
caramel
the
front
is
sweet
the
top
is
light
the
finish
is
moderately
carbonated
dry
lightly
hopped
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
it
does
go
good
with
the
spicy
food
in
the
country
of
origin
and
i
dont
mean
that
olde
gringo
stuff
ranks
907
on
my
current
1000
beer
master
list
ten
times
the
beer
that
corona
ever
will
be
i
have
a
new
respect
for
mexican
beer
after
this
one
a
fine
dark
that
went
down
great
and
was
just
what
i
wanted
not
too
heavy
at
all
as
it
had
a
fine
little
hint
of
roastiness
in
the
backround
one
of
my
favorite
mexican
beers
pours
an
attractive
copper
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
sort
of
a
fresh
bread
smell
the
taste
is
dry
breadlike
with
a
cedary
peppery
flavor
not
too
strong
but
fairly
enjoyable
a
moderate
mouthfeel
available
at
most
mexican
restaurants
and
usually
the
best
one
there
clear
brown
in
appearance
with
very
little
head
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
the
balance
of
malts
and
hops
is
good
for
a
dark
beer
i
was
disappointed
that
there
wasnt
more
flavors
this
is
a
decent
mexican
beer
it
doesnt
blow
you
with
complex
and
fascinating
flavors
but
it
doesnt
need
a
lime
to
be
tolerable
like
some
other
mexican
brews
it
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
hoppiness
goes
well
the
mexican
food
it
is
probably
almost
always
accompaning
an
enjoyable
brew
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
to
take
home
maybe
if
my
wife
is
making
her
enchiladas
but
its
one
of
the
two
or
three
ill
have
at
mexican
restaurants
i
also
love
the
the
marking
on
the
label
calling
it
an
ok
dark
ale
except
the
ale
part
that
is
a
perfect
description
deep
copper

to

layer
thick

the

with
only
a
modest

from
the

with
mild
roasted

bitter

not

come
into

a

brew
if
you
are
at
a
mexican
restaurant
please
get
this
instead
of
corona
coppery
colored
and
not
very
hearty
for
a
darker
beer
but
i
cant
complain
too
much
as
it
went
great
with
my
enchiladas
everything
is
adequate
here
not
bad
but
nothing
special
give
it
a
shot
cheers
dark
amber
body
with
a
big
bubbly
head
decent
head
retention
not
much
aroma
slightly
malty
with
a
bit
of
hop
spiciness
caramel
malt
flavor
is
very
mild
but
increases
as
the
beer
warms
good
offset
to
mexican
food
heavily
laced
with
cholula
but
thats
about
it
too
heavily
carbonated
but
tolerable
negra
modelo
is
a
moderately
aboveaverage
lager
disguised
as
a
good
beer
sure
its
got
a
little
malt
sweetness
and
a
discernible
hop
finish
even
an
aroma
one
might
describe
as
toasty
if
they
had
never
smelled
roasted
sweet
corn
nevertheless
a
beer
of
this
mahogany
shade
is
expected
to
deliver
more
to
the
buds
clearing
the
way
for
your
next
bite
of
chile
rellenos
is
its
crowning
achievement
good
with
a
mexican
meal
and
better
than
many
mexican
imports
but
nothing
special
about
this
beer
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
and
has
a
1
12
finger
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
a
that
of
a
sweet
malty
beer
has
a
distinct
but
not
harsh
bite
that
fades
quickly
with
each
swallow
the
hops
are
noticeable
but
quickly
disappear
i
searched
the
flavor
with
each
swallow
but
its
gone
so
quickly
the
only
thing
i
get
out
of
it
is
a
mild
musty
sweetness
that
lingers
i
cant
tell
much
else
about
it
it
goes
down
nicely
although
it
doesnt
leave
you
desiring
more
you
just
dont
care
not
bad
but
definetely
not
great
perhaps
a
decent
mexican
import
but
lacks
alot
in
comparison
to
most
imports
interesting
while
i
only
had
one
of
these
imports
it
smmes
like
a
pretty
solid
brew
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
slightly
light
head
the
tast
is
a
bit
harsh
at
the
first
sip
but
gets
better
as
you
go
perhaps
not
the
best
brew
from
south
of
the
border
but
definately
worth
a
try
though
not
a
fan
of
mexican
beers
this
one
isnt
so
bad
sort
of
funny
to
see
a
mexican
dark
lager
but
from
what
i
understand
its
actually
a
german
recipe
that
they
didnt
screw
up
in
mexico
most
mexican
restaurants
in
my
area
have
this
brew
so
it
beats
the
alternatives
of
corona
or
our
mass
produced
crap
cheers
reddish
brown
with
moderate
head
and
moderate
carbonation
roasted
malt
character
reminiscent
of
caramel
or
nuts
warms
as
it
finishes
and
has
a
mouth
coating
mouthfeel
mexican
beer
has
never
really
been
my
bag
modelos
ability
to
maket
something
as
tasteless
as
corona
continues
to
surprise
me
to
say
the
least
that
said
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
the
negra
i
must
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
short
fat
bottle
is
pretty
cool
but
the
rich
smooth
taste
is
what
i
liked
this
beer
hits
the
tounge
with
a
bit
of
creamy
taste
then
a
mild
hoppy
bite
rings
through
it
finishes
a
bit
dry
and
very
clean
makes
me
want
another
negra
modelo
this
is
the
only
beer
ill
order
in
a
mexican
restaurant
it
is
a
brown
lager
that
is
very
drinkable
and
goes
very
well
with
hot
foods
nice
sweetness
with
a
hop
bite
very
good
i
tend
to
order
this
one
when
i
go
to
a
mexian
restaurant
i
frequent
called
talitas
i
have
had
always
been
careful
about
these
type
of
beers
but
i
found
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
a
great
mexicanmade
vienna
lager
this
particular
beer
has
a
medium
brown
color
a
good
deal
darker
than
most
vienna
lagers
it
has
a
good
malt
aroma
with
a
dry
malt
flavor
and
aftertaste
a
good
effort
by
grupo
modelo
pours
clear
copper
brown
with
a
very
thin
head
that
vanishes
is
a
flash
of
an
eye
smelled
a
little
acidic
with
no
real
appealing
aromas
the
tast
was
nothing
really
to
note
very
thin
on
flavors
maybe
some
sweetness
from
malt
or
baley
no
hops
that
i
noticed
very
thin
watery
going
down
it
was
drinkable
after
a
12
hour
workday
and
free
it
looked
better
than
it
tasted
the
bottle
is
nice
enough
unique
shape
and
gold
lettering
but
thats
about
it
i
know
not
to
buy
it
clear
dark
copper
hue
the
thick
head
quickly
settles
into
a
persistent
head
that
leaves
a
sparse
lace
theres
more
character
in
aroma
than
typical
for
the
insipid
style
notes
of
toffee
biscuit
malt
and
rich
munich
malt
are
discernable
but
not
assertive
rather
than
the
addition
of
caramel
coloring
only
real
malt
flavors
are
contributed
by
crystal
and
munich
malt
hop
bitterness
is
low
and
residual
sweetness
thus
asserts
itself
finishes
sweet
and
clean
if
considered
an
american
dark
lager
negra
modelo
has
more
flavor
and
malt
character
than
average
for
style
though
as
a
beer
in
itself
it
isnt
outstanding
like
other
european
derived
mexican
lagers
it
does
need
to
be
paired
with
food
the
only
real
complaint
you
can
have
about
this
beer
is
that
the
flavor
is
definitely
thin
what
flavor
there
is
is
pleasant
little
to
no
hops
in
aroma
or
taste
makes
this
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
theres
also
a
little
more
to
the
palate
than
youd
expect
from
the
light
taste
if
you
ever
get
a
beer
craving
in
a
mexican
restaurant
this
and
dos
equis
are
your
only
two
real
choices
a
very
clear
dark
brown
big
initial
head
that
calms
quickly
like
an
american
macro
muted
aroma
at
best
mostly
of
malt
onetwo
flavor
profile
malt
then
hop
flavor
neither
is
extraordinary
almost
deliberately
practiced
to
be
nonoffensive
fairly
good
mouthfeel
helped
by
a
lack
of
overcarbonation
the
malt
sweetness
seems
to
dominate
but
is
lacking
as
far
as
interesting
tastes
an
ok
beer
in
my
opinion
but
one
lacking
in
the
complexity
and
memorability
categories
this
is
one
of
the
more
flavorful
mexican
beers
it
is
like
dos
equis
amber
but
with
a
smoother
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
goes
well
with
beef
enchiladas
it
has
nothing
on
wellmade
english
and
german
beers
but
it
is
not
bad
beer
at
all
i
recommend
it
within
the
context
of
the
mexican
restaurant
only
otherwise
there
are
better
beers
to
have
feliz
cinco
de
mayo
i
decided
to
try
the
ubiquitous
dark
beer
in
celebration
of
the
ubiquitous
mexican
holiday
pours
a
medium
brown
translucent
amber
with
practically
no
head
aromas
are
not
offensive
nor
are
they
memorable
slightly
malty
slightly
herbal
whatever
the
taste
is
very
light
also
not
necessarily
offensive
barely
bitter
slightly
dry
absolutely
no
lingering
finish
if
you
drink
this
with
mexican
food
make
sure
it
isnt
spicy
otherwise
this
beer
tastes
like
water
average
on
all
counts
if
you
feel
the
need
to
drink
a
mexican
beer
though
at
least
this
isnt
offensive
light
overall
aroma
thats
mostly
malt
with
a
bit
of
roastedness
to
it
full
head
reddish
brown
almost
copper
very
clear
fairly
heavy
carbonation
is
what
i
noted
first
light
overall
malt
taste
with
some
roastedness
and
caramel
qualities
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
there
is
a
creaminess
to
the
feel
that
i
like
seems
refreshing
probably
good
with
spicey
food
i
like
this
beer
it
has
a
very
bubbly
head
which
quickly
leveled
to
a
thin
lace
the
dark
color
is
very
appealing
it
doesnt
smell
all
that
great
and
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
dark
beer
it
lacks
the
thick
flavor
most
darker
beers
have
nevertheless
its
a
tasty
easy
to
drink
beer
just
mexican
beer
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
and
caramel
or
something
pretty
boring
beer
but
it
goes
down
easy
first
off
get
that
god
damn
lime
shit
away
from
my
beer
just
leave
the
beer
alone
it
is
just
fine
the
way
it
is
put
me
in
any
east
boston
mexicanlatin
infused
eatery
or
even
a
decent
chain
like
chevys
fresh
tex
mex
and
i
will
in
rare
form
with
this
beer
at
my
side
impressionmust
have
gotten
a
very
fresh
six
pack
oh
the
aroma
still
wish
the
flavor
would
have
held
up
it
end
i
used
to
think
this
was
my
favorite
mexican
beer
i
dont
anymore
itsjust
averge
dos
equis
is
clean
and
crisp
and
stays
flavorful
throughout
the
meal
this
beer
tastes
good
at
first
and
then
becomes
flat
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
want
something
different
but
not
great
its
a
good
dark
lager
and
best
mexican
choice
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
if
you
want
a
really
good
dark
lager
look
for
saranec
black
forest
not
a
bad
dark
lager
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
imho
washes
down
spicey
mex
fare
and
offsets
it
nicely
with
its
slighty
sweet
malty
flavor
this
is
actually
quite
good
for
mexican
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
very
smaooth
and
satisfying
most
previous
beers
i
tried
from
south
of
the
border
were
crap
a
very
pleasant
darkamber
good
alone
or
to
take
the
sizzle
out
of
a
spicy
mexican
meal
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
hard
to
believe
this
is
the
same
brewery
that
makes
corona
notes
an
average
example
of
the
dark
american
lager
style
no
more
no
less
an
excellent
complement
to
any
mexican
meal
one
of
the
good
ones
from
mexico
not
the
best
but
not
bad
at
all
watery
and
flat
more
of
an
ordinary
american
adjunct
lager
than
anything
else
mild
aroma
of
malt
with
slight
cornvegetables
balanced
flavor
with
a
bit
of
caramel
no
hop
aroma
or
flavor
only
enough
neutral
bitter
to
balance
the
sweet
background
moderately
low
body
finishes
clean
good
beer
with
chilled
spiced
shrimp
or
chips
and
salsa
id
buy
it
again
o
good
flavors
clean
and
refreshing
very
easy
to
finish
considerably
more
flavor
than
much
of
the
standard
light
lagers
in
mexico
so
its
an
option
for
anyone
looking
to
go
beyond
corona
dos
equis
tecate
and
the
like
pretty
well
done
for
the
dunkel
lager
style
overall
id
say
that
this
is
a
beer
i
wish
theyd
import
to
the
us
its
certainly
better
than
negra
modelo
much
more
superior
to
corona
and
a
whole
host
of
mexican
beerswhich
are
usually
not
too
impressive
to
begin
with
overall
granted
that
any
mexican
beer
is
in
its
element
when
sipped
in
high
heat
with
the
surf
pounding
in
the
background
this
beer
is
still
objectively
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
i
forsee
myself
having
a
lot
more
of
this
this
beer
was
ok
it
was
very
drinkable
but
not
great
something
called
negra
i
was
expecting
a
fuller
taste
other
than
my
expectations
it
was
very
smooth
and
would
be
good
for
a
casual
drinker
it
was
very
similar
to
corona
but
a
little
more
malty
pours
a
clear
almost
amber
color
with
a
smallish
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lace
wow
there
is
something
in
the
aroma
here
other
than
corn
and
hops
darker
malts
may
actually
be
present
here
sweet
malty
aroma
gives
some
hints
of
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
bread
taste
is
malty
and
a
little
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
cocoa
very
little
if
any
hops
are
found
in
this
brew
light
body
heavy
level
of
carbonation
syrupywatery
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
this
one
is
like
your
usual
mexican
beer
with
some
drops
of
a
colour
agent
just
to
change
its
colournothing
else
really
disappointed
with
this
one
i
was
expecting
much
more
taste
o
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
as
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
flavourful
given
the
strong
recommendation
by
our
server
nonetheless
a
drinkable
ale
and
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
probably
the
best
surprise
among
the
mexican
beers
ive
tried
i
like
it
and
given
the
choices
available
here
only
beers
from
mexicos
big
2
id
pick
it
over
everything
else
murky
brown
color
with
little
lacing
aroma
is
faint
with
only
a
hint
of
phenols
and
toasted
malts
slightly
skunky
as
well
the
most
prominent
flavor
is
the
carbonation
as
evything
else
is
so
weak
moderate
amounts
of
ripened
banana
and
toasted
barley
metallic
with
a
touch
of
dms
body
is
thinned
fortunately
the
carbonation
keeps
any
vegetal
offnotes
from
lingering
maybe
the
bottle
i
had
was
frayed
than
the
can
but
there
was
a
skunkiness
all
the
way
through
this
one
that
was
not
too
good
t
some
sweet
notes
crispy
on
tongue
a
very
tiny
toast
flavour
there
is
no
end
at
all
is
a
very
simple
beer
on
the
style
overall
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
available
if
youre
in
mexico
visit
for
the
cheap
tequila
not
the
brew
overall
a
decent
adjunct
lager
certainly
not
the
worst
in
mexico
but
does
not
compare
favourably
to
other
beers
of
the
munich
dunkel
lager
or
kellerbier
style
león
must
be
somewhat
unusual
for
mexican
beer
drinkers
accustomed
to
yellow
lagers
and
a
real
treat
for
those
who
know
theres
more
to
beer
than
just
that
that
said
the
germans
would
likely
deem
it
insipid
and
irreverent
and
rightfully
so
considering
the
relative
high
quality
integrity
and
overall
standard
of
their
inveterate
breweries
d
this
beer
is
an
interesting
one
for
me
the
color
and
the
aroma
dont
match
up
too
well
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
roasty
aroma
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
at
4
5
abv
luckily
this
beer
was
a
gift
from
a
buddy
of
mine
who
visited
cancun
overall
a
decent
beer
that
will
push
me
to
try
more
dunkel
lagers
my
second
beer
i
drank
from
the
bottle
rather
than
a
glass
and
the
experience
was
more
pleasant
md
thin
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
a
better
option
than
most
of
the
more
popular
mexican
beers
widely
available
drinkability
this
one
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
is
good
enough
to
session
d
very
much
so
if
you
are
in
mexico
get
some
leon
pours
a
clear
almost
amber
color
with
a
smallish
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lace
wow
there
is
something
in
the
aroma
here
other
than
corn
and
dms
darker
malts
may
actually
be
present
here
sweet
malty
aroma
gives
some
hints
of
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
bread
taste
is
malty
and
a
little
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
cocoa
very
little
if
any
hops
are
found
in
this
brew
light
body
heavy
level
of
carbonation
syrupywatery
mouthfeel
i
think
i
enjoyed
this
most
out
of
all
the
light
lagers
i
had
on
my
trip
or
maybe
it
was
the
searing
heat
and
the
thirst
i
worked
up
climbing
around
the
ruins
for
half
the
day
this
is
definitely
not
a
munich
dunkel
but
i
enjoyed
several
of
these
before
sailing
away
it
was
nice
too
see
something
a
little
different
to
drink
in
cozumel
amber
color
clear
with
a
minimal
offwhite
diminishing
head
some
light
caramel
in
the
nose
and
taste
doesnt
look
like
an
adjunct
beer
but
you
can
tell
by
drinking
it
not
much
hop
character
to
speak
of
light
bodied
frothy
mouthfeel
look
dark
brown
color
bare
head
of
foam
with
white
burrs
smell
grain
roasted
malt
and
toffee
taste
roasted
malt
toffee
balanced
with
resiny
hops
mouthfeel
refreshing
medium
bitterness
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
drinkability
acceptable
in
all
respects
the
junior
version
of
negra
modelo
but
the
presentation
is
very
bad
drinkability
is
good
for
an
amber
lager
this
is
well
done
to
an
extent
but
nothing
to
seek
out
amber
lagers
are
usually
hit
or
miss
but
this
falls
between
the
two
worth
a
shot
overall
really
good
compared
to
its
cousins
but
still
pretty
boring
overall
very
drinkable
sessionable
refreshing
not
a
great
beer
but
decent
for
the
right
settingoccasion
drinkability
smooth
very
easy
overall
bland
and
unexciting
it
doesnt
taste
skunked
maybe
a
bit
stale
but
not
sure
as
the
smell
was
fairly
good
compared
to
the
rest
maybe
best
enjoyed
under
a
tropical
sun
taste
little
bit
of
skunk
bitter
finish
easily
drinkable
good
alternative
to
corona
if
youre
ever
in
mexico
overly
rich
and
underly
complex
compared
to
a
negra
modelo
for
example
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
smooth
gently
spiced
with
hops
and
easy
drinking
easy
to
drink
super
light
mouthfeel
for
beer
found
in
mexico
its
not
bad
but
bottom
line
i
had
to
search
out
reached
for
this
quite
a
few
more
times
than
the
easily
available
coronas
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
munich
style
beer
maybe
so
but
i
doubt
it
still
it
was
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
i
had
on
a
recent
trip
to
mexico
it
was
amber
in
color
with
a
small
head
it
had
a
malty
sweet
aroma
a
caramel
taste
with
some
warmth
to
it
i
thought
it
had
a
little
substance
and
would
drink
it
again
not
a
bad
mexican
beer
but
i
really
have
trouble
distinguishing
this
from
modelos
victoria
a
supposed
vienna
lager
whatever
its
not
bad
and
you
can
drink
it
on
the
beach
overall
a
soso
lager
the
flavor
had
its
ups
and
downs
with
a
licorice
and
light
dry
cocoa
flavor
worth
seeking
out
if
in
mexico
otherwise
dont
bother
like
montejo
try
it
with
some
cochinita
and
frijoles
con
puerco
the
leon
pours
to
a
brownrust
color
with
some
red
highlights
has
a
small
to
medium
head
that
breaks
down
quite
rapidly
leaving
some
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
but
not
much
thin
wisps
has
a
nice
aroma
to
it
probably
the
nicest
smelling
mexican
brew
i
have
had
to
date
has
a
nice
malt
scent
with
no
real
hop
aroma
malt
dominates
the
taste
with
a
very
rich
malt
flavor
that
might
be
accentuated
by
the
warm
weather
can
notice
a
little
hop
taste
along
with
the
carbonation
which
gives
it
a
slight
bite
at
most
also
notice
a
slight
metallic
taste
but
it
is
hard
to
pick
up
overall
this
is
my
favorite
mexican
brew
that
i
have
had
has
some
character
which
made
it
feel
like
you
where
not
drinking
carbonated
water
and
was
still
light
enough
to
drink
while
in
the
warm
weather
i
have
not
seen
this
back
home
but
will
have
to
see
if
i
can
track
it
down
while
at
out
local
mexican
restaurants
salud
this
is
an
ok
dark
lager
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
negra
modelo
is
a
far
more
balanced
mexican
dark
lager
a
full
bodied
beer
munich
dunkel
lager
style
its
beer
style
in
this
site
is
wrong
is
not
a
marzen
oktoberfest
special
beer
for
a
southeastern
mexican
food
like
a
cochinita
pibil
motulenian
eggs
papadzules
etc
its
appearance
in
light
dark
made
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
grupo
modelo
drinkability
is
over
the
average
try
with
german
cuisine
95
recommended
probably
one
of
my
best
beers
here
the
lager
is
in
but
with
a
different
taste
montejo
and
leon
are
brewed
in
another
state
of
mexico
that
makes
them
different
and
without
any
doubt
the
original
owners
were
a
little
more
interested
in
fine
beers
much
better
than
the
standard
mexican
fare
but
still
a
disappointing
beer
and
a
disgrace
to
the
octoberfest
style
i
can
have
some
more
especially
with
some
spicy
and
hot
yucatán
food
pours
an
ivory
head
settling
over
clear
medium
amber
liquid
sweet
malty
nose
with
a
hint
of
caramel
malty
sweetness
carries
thru
on
the
palate
sort
of
in
the
vienna
or
marzen
style
sweet
with
a
light
toasted
background
finishes
subtly
bittersweet
as
it
warms
up
not
the
worst
mex
beer
ive
drank
consumed
in
october
2004
in
cancun
mexico
from
a
bottle
pours
a
light
ambercopper
color
kinda
like
a
weak
iced
tea
color
smells
of
bad
cough
syrup
and
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
way
maybe
a
bitter
hop
or
two
watery
like
the
rest
decent
carbonation
maybe
a
tinge
of
sweetness
but
really
dry
at
the
end
a
bad
name
and
a
bad
beer
imo
all
in
all
not
a
bad
drink
it
just
could
be
more
assertive
this
was
the
dark
beer
at
the
all
inclusive
at
playa
del
carmin
i
drank
plenty
of
them
some
were
very
good
and
rivaled
negra
modela
others
were
very
bad
the
good
ones
were
dark
amber
with
a
fairly
good
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
very
mild
but
i
could
detect
some
malt
the
taste
was
of
malt
and
the
moutfeel
was
moderate
these
were
nice
drinking
at
the
cabana
on
the
beach
watching
topless
sunbathers
the
bad
ones
had
a
off
sour
smell
and
a
taste
to
match
after
a
couple
of
these
i
would
give
up
beer
for
a
few
hours
and
was
forced
to
drink
taquilla
and
watch
the
topless
sunbathers
this
mexican
munich
style
lager
really
is
reminiscent
of
the
vienna
style
the
rich
amber
color
is
a
pleasant
sight
the
malty
body
is
smooth
and
rounded
could
use
more
hops
and
the
aroma
is
on
the
mild
side
imho
this
leon
the
best
mexican
beer
available
including
negra
modela
a
well
crafted
satisfying
brew

everyone

the

a

of

character
on
the
finish
overall
i
was
slightly
disappointed
with
this
the
mineral
taste
was
really
offputting
and
it
was
sweeter
than
i
had
expected
probably
wont
revisit
final
thoughts
a
good

that
i
would
recommend
and
certainly
went
exceptionally
well
with

at

up

would

just

its
a

drinkable
beer

it
just
misses
the
mark
for

try
this
one
if
you
can
because
it
showcases
german
craftsmanship
of

not
a
true
alt
yet
a

beer
once

have
to
remind
myself
that
this
brew
was
made
with
a
strict
adherence

nothing
outof

by

will
be

this

one
of

best
beers
which
is
saying
much
this
beer
is
for
the
true
daily
beer
lovers
i
wouldnt
say
its
as
smooth
as
many
a
belgium
beers
but
the
dunkel
version
is
something
to
look
forward
to
a
great
tasting
full
body
beer
and
can
be
drank
in
large
amounts
as
i
can
attest
to
i
was
a
recipient
of
generosity
by
the
augustiner
brew
master
for
we
bought
direct
a
50l
keg
and
brought
it
back
to
the
states
to
say
the
american
beer
drinkers
were
in
ahhh
of
this
brew
is
an
understatement

maybe
really
just
complex
as
i
even
pull
a
touch
of
vanilla
through
after
a
few
minutes
really
nice
and
quite
full
feel
for
the
style
due
in
most
part
to
near
perfect
carbonation
this
allows
the
flavor
to
roll
across
the
palate
and
really
just
cling
to
every
ounce
of
taste
buds
you
have
caramel
bready
notes
hints
of
light

are
all
leading
the
charge

the

though
i
could
justify
it
being
nutty
as
well
the
flavor
is
bready
too

not
rich
enough
to
be
nuttyclean
spritzy
once
when
i
was
a
beer
rookie
i
described
a

it
be

nothing
that
is
worth
high
praises
but
sure
a
fine
beer
not
a
huge
amount
of
experience
so
tough
to
say
if
this
is
insubstantial
or
just
to
style
drinks
quick
either
way
but
ive
had
better
and
worse
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
dunkel
however
the
heavy
malty
body
prevents
this
one
from
being
a
true

lord
knows
german
food
is
best
seasoned
with
beer
the
toasty
malt
aroma
gets
you
right
off
the
bat
there
is
a
slightly
metallic
tone
in
both
the
flavor
and
the
smell
it
has
a
dark
brown
body
with
some
little
tan
bubbles
forming
the
tan

and
lace
it
has
roasted

taste
but
that
is
average
for
this
style
it
is
a
good
beer
do
not
get
me
wrong
but
it
is
average
or
less
for
this
area
there
is
barely
any

is

a
great

for
sure
full

and
enjoyable
the
bolder
flavors
might
make
it
tough
to
drink
too
many
of
these
but
the
one
i
had
was
a
real
treat
i
also
sampled
this
one
on

in

and
it
was
a
gem
there
as
well
recommended
get
it
youll
be
glad
you
did
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
taste
is
nice
with
some
good
chocolates
and
subtle
coffee
flavors
coming
from
the
malts
the
slightest
touch
of
dark
fruit
low
bitterness
but
there
is
a
tartness
from
the
hops
i
would
assume
this
beer
is
a
little
too
fizzy
for
me
too
much
like
a
soda
but
overall
the
mouthfeel
was
desirable
and
very
drinkable
tasty
and
worthwhile
d
very
drinkable

had

liters
and
could
have
stayed
for
more
if
there
werent
more
beer
halls
in
munich
to
explore
better
on
tap
this
is
an
allround
classic
and
my
favourite
from
the
brewery
drinkability
definitely
a
session
beer
maybe
it
was
the
atmosphere
maybe
it
was
the
people
but
i
had
8
of
these
throughout
the
night
and
never
thought
twice
about
it
oh
well
just
need
to
go
back
to
munich
for
another
sample
d
d
a
decent
dunkel
yum
a
fine
example
of
that

thought
a
great
session
beer
and
another
classic
from
the
master

now
in

it
starts
to

some
cream
kbub6fmar

soft
mouthfeel
it
whispers
quality
with
every
taste
due
to
its
rich
character
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
dark
ale
overall
the
clear
winner
of
my
day
at
harpoon
this
is
an
exceptional
munich
dunkel
which
i
would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
passing
through
or
looking
for
a
beer
with
nice
flavor
without
being
overly
heavy
or
boozy
my
fifth
offering
from
harpoon
one
of
the
first
dunkels
ive
tried
as
well
rich
brown
color
with
a
lighter
tan
head
than
id
expect
chocolatey
mocha
flavor
deep
body
rich
like
a
porter
soft
mouthfeel
though
a
bit
grainy
burnt
aroma
pretty
nice
a
great
munich
dunkel
dont
have
much
experience
with
these
but
i
liked
it
o
a
very
solid
dark
lager
full
of
great
flavors
without
being
too
heavy
although
i
wouldnt
mind
it
being
slightly
less
sweet
a
great
fallwinter
beer
highly
recommended
for
dark
lager
or
dark
beer
in
general
fans
overall
mmmm
dunkel
beer
this
is
a
style
that
i
love
every
once
in
a
while
i
have
been
enjoying
this
one
for
many
years
and
more
to
come
roasty
toasty
caramelly
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
earthy
hops
underlie
the
flavor
but
cave
to
the
malt
overall
a
really
fine
example
of
the
style
one
that
is
rarely
brewed
by
domestic
breweries
overall
a
solid
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
first
time
i
had
it
so
i
had
to
review
the
second
one
to
spread
the
word
im
picturing
it
as
a
perfect
pair
for
a
savory
chicken
or
turkey
dish
o
i
had
this
one
last
year
and
hated
it
having
it
now
its
less
awful
and
more
hohum
still
it
does
a
solid
job
of
hitting
the
qualities
a
dark
lager
should
d
not
bad
its
average
would
get
again
if
theres
nothing
better
at
time
of
purchase
o
a
nice
easy
drinker
its
quite
quaffable
at
5
2
according
to
the
bottle
hits
the
spot
for
those
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
lager
a
good
fall
beer
this
is
a
munich
style
dark
ale
meaning
a
bigger
sweeter
malt
profile
and
a
yeast
strain
with
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
the
nose
is
quite
roasty
with
some
cocoa
and
caramel
notes
a
little
dusty
on
the
malt
end
but
not
in
a
stale
way
i
taste
some
lighter
german
pilsner
malts
which
makes
sense
some
chocolate
flavors
and
a
little
residual
sugar
despite
a
dry
finish
overall
a
rich
yet
drinkable
brew
a
good
addition
to
the
winter
mix
12er
and
a
beer
im
happy
to
have
quite
a
few
of
full
body
a
little
filling
but
good
carbonation
lightens
things
up
overall
a
satisfying
beer
from
harpoon
overall
i
think
this
is
a
grower
first
time
i
tried
it
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
but
i
came
back
and
harpoon
dark
and
i
are
becoming
pretty
good
friends
very
drinkable
for
a
dark
beer
which
is
always
nice
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
a
great
thirst
quencher
with
plenty
of
flavor
this
is
nicely
done
by
harpoon
and
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
them
that
i
have
tried
so
far
o
this
one
is
malty
and
delicious
the
smoky
notes
makes
for
some
bold
flavors
this
would
pair
well
with
food
but
dies
just
fine
in
its
own
one
of
my
favorites
from
harpoon
12
ounce

pours
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
1
finger
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
good
spotty
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
aromas
of
big
caramel

biscuit
chocolate
vanilla

fantastic
aromas
with
great

and

taste

herbal

and
light
dark

lingering
notes
of

and
light

nice
balance
and
complexity
of
flavors
with
no
cloying
sweetness
at
all
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
munich
dunkel
nice
flavor
balance
and
robustness
and
very
smooth
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
and
this
might
be
my
choice
for
an
easily
available
dunkel
in
the
future
taste
rounds
out
a
simpler
cocoa
and
light
roast
maltiness
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
this
is
a
pretty
good
stab
at
a
dunkel
harpoon
did
a
good
job
of
keeping
it
simple
and
fresh
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
the
sweetness
is
lower
than
typical
for
the
style
but
those
are
pretty
minor
complaints
at
2
99
a
bomber
this
is
a
god
deal
i
have
not
seen
this
in
sixers
but
if
i
saw
it
at
around
8
bucks
id
return
to
this
one
fairly
often
especially
with
the
much
appreciated
best
by
date
props
to
you
harpoon
well
done
my
moderate
pour
still
managed
to
produce
a
massive
twoplus
fingers
of
rocky
lighttan
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
mahoganybrown
with
nequality
clarity
and
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
in
evidence
nose
was
chocolaty
more
like
milk
chocolate
than
dark
chocolate
though
mouthfeel
was
slightly
full
thanks
to
all
of
the
carbonation
and
the
taste
was
of
a
mild
chocolate
definitely
not
roasty
finish
was
likewise
pleasant
and
chocolaty
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
but
as
a
selfavowed
hophead
i
would
not
want
more
than
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
o
a
nice
beer
but
could
use
bolder
flavor
good
if
you
were
looking
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
of
dark
brews
would
probably
have
again
if
given
the
chance
o
overall
not
the
quality
of
a
stout
but
more
like
a
porter
a
decent
beer
that
is
light
bodied
besides
the
tint
not
very
heavy
on
the
mouth
at
all
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
a
good
beer
to
try
for
harpoon
fans
or
if
your
experimenting
overall
not
bad
a
bit
overpowering
with
malts
and
hops
that
it
kinda
loses
the
whole
lager
part
but
that
does
lighten
the
body
dry
the
finish
and
make
it
much
more
drinkable
than
i
think
it
would
if
it
were
a
dark
ale
the
dark
malts
do
add
nice
characters
and
hops
are
decent
and
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
so
overall
pretty
good
for
harpoon
especially
originally
reviewed
01162011
overall
another
intereting
beer
in
a
style
i
have
only
had
once
stilli
greatly
enjoyed
this
one
from
harpoon
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
ill
be
coming
back
to
harpoon
dark
the
next
time
i
get
a
chance
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
dunkels
ive
had
liked
it
more
tha
old
mecklenburgs
and
theirs
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
certainly
different
due
to
the
mixing
of
the
lager
and
ale
characteristics
i
would
say
i
enjoyed
it
but
would
not
necessarily
want
to
buy
it
again
o
a
very
decent
session
beer
although
a
bit
underwhelming
compared
to
the
actual
german
beers
it
is
modeled
after
not
a
bad
homage
for
the
price
point
an
okay
beer
at
best
pours
a
dark
brown
light
khaki
colored
head
with
some
staying
power
nutty
lightly
toasted
aroma
pretty
malt
forward
in
the
taste
munich
malts
are
there
lending
nutty
chocolatey
sugary
notes
caramel
brown
sugar
and
cocoa
powder
all
figure
into
the
taste
there
is
a
very
small
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
overall
not
a
bad
session
beer
from
harpoon
pretty
tasty
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
brown
color
the
head
is
fluffy
looking
and
light
tan
in
color
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
lightly
roasted
and
a
little
nutty
the
flavor
had
a
dry
earthy
flavor
with
a
light
amount
of
the
nuts
and
roast
coming
in
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
carbonated
pretty
well
overall
its
nothing
too
special
to
me
its
a
decent
brew
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
unless
i
had
too
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
amberbrown
color
that
is
almost
black
in
the
depths
with
a
thin
small
bubbled
layer
of
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
nothing
aromas
of
roasted
coffee
and
molasses
with
a
toasty
quality
as
well
the
beers
flavors
are
darkly
roasted
as
well
with
a
strong
coffee
bitterness
counteracted
by
a
darkly
sweet
molasses
and
toffee
profile
there
is
a
toasty
and
smokey
quality
that
enhances
the
sweetness
and
makes
this
beer
a
great
campfire
brew
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
cloying
with
a
hint
of
the
coffee
bitterness
and
smoke
to
clean
it
all
up
a
slick
linger
finish
that
recedes
slowly
from
the
palate
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
tasty
beer
overall
osurprised
by
this
beer
the
roasted
malt
is
present
and
just
a
good
mesh
of
flavors
one
of
the
better
harpoons
o
very
drinkable
and
tasty
good
all
around
beer
beer
is
thin
in
body
very
malty
on
the
get
go
it
is
mildly
bitter
roasty
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
overall
beer
is
nice
but
very
simple
probably
too
thin
tastes
like
a
sweet
bock
i
might
have
it
again
in
the
future
poured
a
2

mocha
colored
head
which
lasted
quite
a
long
time
clear
burn
umber
brown
color
smell
isnt
strong
but
includes
malt
and
rye
taste
is
milder
than
smell
and
a
fast
swig
was
forgettable
almost
like
a
bmc
but
a
slower
more
attentative
sip
yielded
malt
and
rye
and
a
maybe
even
a
little
cocoa
a
step
up
from
average
american
beers
but
id
still
rather
have
a
munich
than
a
munich
type
a
fine
example
of
the
style
from
an
american
brewery
prosit
drinkability
easily
drinkable
a
munichstyle
session
beer
this
beer
did
indeed
bring
back
memories
of
drinking
this
style
beer
in
a
munich
biergarten
overall
i
really
should
have
picked
up
a
few
bottles
since
i
am
sure
next
week
they
may
not
be
there
especially
after
the
tasting
but
i
will
keep
my
eye
out
if
i
see
it
in
another
mix
and
match
selection
very
drinkable
dunkel
lager
pours
a
brownish
amber
color
with
great
tan
head
in
my
pilsner
glass
aromas
are
plentiful
with
notes
of
slight
acidic
coffee
chocolate
toffee
caramel
and
roastlike
goodness
pure
malt
flavors
no
real
hop
presence
tastes
like
dark
malts
breadlike
flavors
like
cocoa
coffee
caramel
and
chocolate
slightly
acidic
in
taste
nice
carbonation
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
slight
sweetness
thats
pretty
well
evened
out
by
the
hops
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
one
of
my
favs
from
harpoon
great
to
have
in
chillier
weather
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
decnt
sized
light
tan
head
the
aromas
i
get
are
sweet
and
roasty
from
the
darker
malts
used
to
produce
this
beer
the
taste
is
fairly
similar
to
the
smell
slightly
sweet
and
roasty
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
in
trying
to
be
objective
i
dont
know
what
to
really
say
about
the
beer
it
didnt
stand
out
much
unbelievably
drinkable
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
styles
though
this
is
certainly
coming
at
it
sideways
using
an
all
yeast
still
while
i
may
like
mine
just
a
tiny
hair
cleaner
and
less
fruity
this
was
a
beautifully
hearty
and
satisfying
beer
very
pleased
its
a
very
easy
drinker
but
a
little
bland
i
wouldnt
really
go
for
another
nor
would
i
see
myself
buying
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
if
offered
very
drinkable
wish
i
saw
more
of
this
one
in
the
philadelphia
area
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
it
is
quite
sessionable
thin
but
dark
body
refreshing
and
goes
down
smooth
had
three
throughout
a
meal
notes
a
damn
solid
beer
probably
the
best
beer
harpoon
makes
outside
of
the
leviathon
series
the
vague
fruitiness
and
mild
roasted
malt
edge
are
a
bit
uncharacteristic
for
the
style
but
in
this
case
i
think
the
beer
benefits
from
it
a
very
tasty
approachable
and
easy
to
drink
beer
this
has
been
a
new
favorite
of
mine
lately
and
its
availability
on
tap
at
the
local
bars
means
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
it
its
acceptable
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
by
any
means
d
not
a
beer
to
enjoy
on
its
own
this
seems
more
like
a
beer
to
have
with
dinner
medium
bodied
medium
carbed
mouthfeel
goes
down
fairly
easily
flavorful
enough
that
it
keeps
you
interested
but
not
so
much
that
the
palate
becomes
fatigued
d
for
a
darker
beer
its
pretty
good
the
two
from
the
mix
pack
will
suffice
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
on
draft
im
diggin
the
local
fresh
market
for
their
mixed
sixer
collection
this
bottle
included
it
pours
a
clear
dark
garnetruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
coffee
lightish
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
and
a
touch
of
minor
char
the
taste
paints
a
mountain
of
roasted
malts
its
as
though
im
chewing
on
some
roasted
barley
im
tellin
ya
with
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
back
and
a
strong
metallic
aftertaste
yeesh
what
happened
here
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
eversoslightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
all
around
except
for
the
taste
so
close
yet
so
very
very
far
away
drinkability
personally
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
so
1
or
2
would
suffice
for
me
however
if
someone
is
a
fan
of
this
style
well
then
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
you
could
enjoy
a
few
of
a
solid
dark
brown
to
black
beer
with
a
very
solid
head
nice
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
has
a
touch
of
chocolate
with
some
roasted
flavors
blended
in
a
mild
nose
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
very
clean
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
the
carbonation
is
on
the
plus
side
of
medium
very
pleasant
for
this
beer
a
session
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
mixpack
d
enjoyable
beer
and
i
would
drink
a
few
in
a
sitting
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
dark
lager
this
beer
has
a
nice
lightness
to
it
that
is
nice
to
have
in
a
dark
larger
it
goes
down
with
a
nice
silky
yet
smooth
feel
and
is
easy
drinking
d
a
well
crafted
brew
true
to
the
style
pours
pitch
black
allowing
no
light
through
but
permitting
a
thin
white
head
aroma
of
vanilla
caramelmolasses
and
some
smooth
malts
taste
is
exceptionally
smooth
sweetened
with
candy
sugar
that
complements
the
malt
very
well
with
some
lighter
caramel
and
barley
malts
that
fit
it
well
but
dont
overpower
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
dark
i
have
had
i
could
drink
it
all
night
though
i
restrained
myself
raised
my
already
high
opinion
of
harpoon
beers
drinkability
got
it
in
a
sampler
wish
i
had
more
than
two
could
almost
be
a
stout
absolutely
amazing
flavor
at
a
reasonable
price
d
i
love
beers
of
this
type
e
g
sam
adams
black
lager
so
i
could
drink
this
brew
in
quantity
but
i
could
see
how
someone
not
as
much
of
a
fan
might
find
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
much
for
prolonged
consumption
d
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
washed
down
my
pulled
pork
sandwich
excellently
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
moderatelydark
brown
color
with
a
light
head
and
a
touch
of
lace
some
carbonation
around
the
edges
throughout
nose
brings
some
chocolate
caramel
light
roast
fruit
and
a
big
dose
of
the
harpoon
yeast
whichfor
whatever
reasonim
really
into
taste
is
malty
with
some
light
fruit
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
nuttiness
really
nice
feel
brought
on
by
the
house
yeast
drinks
really
quite
nice
and
is
one
of
the
better
versions
of
this
style
that
ive
had
if
you
want
something
for
a
cold
day
or
night
but
you
dont
want
to
get
hammered
this
is
a
very
good
one
d
another
drinkable
beer
from
harpoon
the
abv
is
good
for
the
beer
and
style
a
sixer
of
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
winter
day
good
job
on
another
great
beer
guys
the
fact
that
harpoon
uses
their
house
ale
strain
means
this
technically
isnt
a
true
dunkel
we
can
let
that
fact
slide
as
this
drinks
like
a
proper
dunkel
this
a
great
easy
drinking
dark
brew
strength
aside
this
makes
for
great
dark
session
brew
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
this
brew
offers
proof
that
earth
shattering
can
be
overrated
sometimes
mfd
a
lightly
bodied
brew
with
ample
amounts
of
carbonation
my
favorite
beer
from
harpoon
and
could
drink
this
all
night
d
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
dunkel
very
easy
to
drink
a
low
abv
makes
having
mutliple
in
a
sitting
very
feasible
d
not
bad
but
doesnt
bring
anything
extra
to
the
table
this
beer
is
good
and
well
made
i
would
say
however
it
is
lacking
complexity
and
substance
that
other
beer
of
this
type
better
represent
d
good
drinker
good
brew
for
the
style
well
worth
a
try
easily
drinkable
on
the
first
one
could
probably
put
two
or
three
away
in
a
sitting
overall
it
went
down
quick
because
i
wanted
to
gulp
the
flavor
down
missing
alot
here
why
buy
this
with
ayinger
right
in
the
next
shelf
ill
pass
next
time
d
rich
and
flavorful
yet
goes
down
very
easy
i
could
drink
mug
after
mug
of
this
in
fact
i
think
i
will
rosewood
colored
body
with
dark
ruby
highlights
when
backlit
and
thick
finger
of
tan
foam
that
leaves
fine
lace
on
the
glass
rich
dark
fruit
and
light
molasses
notes
in
the
aroma
rich
and
roasty
with
cocoa
and
raisin
flavors
with
a
touch
of
minty
hops
to
balance
flavors
perfectly
the
body
is
on
the
leaner
side
of
medium
with
bright
carbonation
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
a
really
tasty
example
of
the
style
even
though
technically
its
an
ale
thats
easy
to
drink
pours
a
light
brown
with
offwhite
head
looks
almost
like
a
cola
only
if
the
cola
had
a
tighter
head
no
lacing
or
head
retention
though
smell
is
of
faint
chocolate
some
roasted
malt
and
almost
like
a
root
beer
taste
has
lots
of
chocolate
and
some
bitterness
this
seems
to
be
a
bit
undercarbonated
but
it
isnt
bad
to
drink
d
good
drinkability
could
be
an
interesting
dessertsession
beer
there
is
a
thin
carbonation
feel
to
the
beer
however
that
i
wish
was
a
bit
smoother
if
this
was
bottle
conditioned
it
would
be
amazing
very
drinkable
dark
beer
that
being
said
i
love
it
db
a
good
cheap
beer
this
one
is
one
of
the
more
sessionable
dark
beers
i
have
had
i
love
the
brown
ale
aspects
and
slight
stout
aspects
of
this
beer
no
real
defects
of
offflavors
a
solid
dark
ale
thanks
again
harpoon
continue
doing
great
things
overall
surprised
by
this
one
harpoon
really
did
a
great
job
and
they
should
be
commended
would
go
for
this
one
again
any
day
drinksatisfying
and
goes
down
ultra
smooth
also
the
interesting
after
taste
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
d
all
in
all
this
one
is
dangerously
drinkable
at
5
6
i
could
drink
this
at
a
fall
bonfire
for
hours
mfd
medium
body
chalky
chocolate
lingering
finish
this
beer
was
very
smooth
and
the
taste
had
a
hint
of
chocolate
although
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
darker
beers
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
it
had
a
moderately
hoppy
finish
which
i
liked
and
overall
had
a
very
rich
taste
although
i
enjoyed
this
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
the
type
of
beer
where
i
would
expect
a
large
difference
in
taste
between
bottle
vs
on
tap
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
on
tap
in
the
future
taste
leaves
many
of
the
expectations
from
the
aroma
left
unfulfilled
simply
a
weak
burnt
version
of
the
munich
dunkel
style
very
beautiful
beer
a
thick
tanish
head
dark
mahogany
color
with
slight
transparency
when
held
to
the
light
it
has
a
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
aroma
it
starts
light
and
sweet
and
finishes
with
the
roasted
chocolate
taste
this
taste
lingers
but
not
overwhelming
this
is
very
drinkable
a
light
bodied
beer
a
easy
drinking
stout
for
those
not
familiar
with
the
munich
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
dunkel
lagers
ive
had
perhaps
due
to
the
ale
yeast
despite
the
yeast
situation
this
still
feels
like
a
lager
smooth
and
complex
without
being
too
rich
this
is
a
beer
to
rival
bigger
brews
while
still
being
easy
to
stomach
a
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
big
props
to
harpoon
munich
type
dark
beer
is
a
wonderful
effort
that
just
about
anyone
should
enjoy
from
bmc
drinkers
if
theyd
give
it
a
chance
to
the
biggest
beer
geeks
on
the
planet
if
theyd
give
it
a
chance
i
hope
harpoon
sells
a
lot
of
this
stuff
i
really
like
this
one
as
it
is
complex
and
quaffable
you
can
sip
and
savor
or
just
enjoy
gulp
after
gulp
with
any
snack
or
meal
nice
brew
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
tanned
head
and
sticky
lace
all
around
the
glass
nose
is
a
mixture
of
dark
malt
and
citrus
hops
taste
is
slightly
bitter
up
front
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
grain
clean
and
crisp
finish
medium
to
light
feel
with
moderate
carb
pretty
decent
all
around
d
medium
drinkability
t
very
smooth
but
has
a
bite
of
spice
to
it
too
peppery
cinnamon
kind
of
like
a
christmas
ale
in
a
way
nice
balance
of
flavor
didnt
think
this
was
special
at
all
d
very
drinkable
in
session
or
with
meals
that
go
well
with
dark
wellbalanced
beers
doesnt
rank
with
best
from
bavaria
in
my
opinion
but
still
a
nice
easydrinking
interpretation
of
the
style
md
light
to
medium
carbonation
in
a
heavy
bocklike
lager
texture
not
a
ton
of
character
and
the
burned
flavor
makes
this
one
i
nearly
had
to
choke
down
refreshing
and
pretty
wellbalanced
another
fine
offering
from
the
folks
at
harpoonn
hmm
im
not
entirely
on
board
with
this
one
nice
dark
brown
color
with
tawny
highlights
smell
is
relatively
nonexistenta
bit
of
sweetness
but
thats
about
it
maybe
something
roasted
taste
is
decent
a
bit
of
chocolate
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
lingering
roastiness
medium
body
coating
drinkable
i
guess
something
seems
out
of
order
in
this
one
id
definitely
buy
it
again
overall
good
solid
dunkel
that
might
be
a
tad
watery
tasty
and
drinkable
a
quality
brew
d
rated
high
becasue
could
have
a
lot
if
given
some
a
wonderful
munich
dunkel
it
pours
a
very
nice
deep
ruby
brown
with
some
very
nice
initial
head
and
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
nice
deep
dark
scent
malty
and
lager
sweet
nice
thick
dark
taste
a
wonderful
bit
of
dark
malt
goes
down
very
clean
and
easy
also
i
believe
harpoons
intention
was
to
create
a
munich
dunkel
style
brew
but
fermented
with
ale
yeast
overall
a
solid
beer
fairly
drinkable
overall
and
something
i
would
enjoy
again
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
tasty
beer
probably
one
of
my
favorite
harpoon
brews
outside
of
the
leviathan
series
it
would
be
nice
to
see
them
increase
the
availability
of
this
beer
since
i
have
only
seen
it
at
the
brewery
i
would
gladly
pick
this
up
when
im
looking
for
a
darker
beer
that
isnt
super
thick
and
has
easy
drinkability
for
a
long
time
i
had
become
aggravated
by
harpoon
for
being
a
brewery
with
resources
suggesting
they
had
significant
capability
to
experiment
and
yet
most
of
their
offerings
tasted
both
similar
and
unremarkable
to
me
strangely
revisiting
this
beer
after
really
liking
some
of
their
bigger
recent
offerings
makes
me
think
i
had
unfairly
written
it
off
its
not
outrageously
complex
but
the
flavor
profile
is
enjoyable
and
clearly
a
solid
example
of
the
style
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
some
light
brown
hues
to
it
a
14
finger
of
tan
head
that
has
ok
retention
to
it
some
spots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
thick
dark
roasted
malts
with
great
chocolate
notes
mixed
in
taste
is
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
up
front
lending
in
to
some
nicely
roasted
and
toasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
smoked
flavoring
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
chocolate
kick
to
it
with
a
nice
hop
presence
for
some
bitterness
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
creamy
mouth
feel
with
a
bitter
bone
dry
finish
to
it
for
me
this
was
a
well
put
together
drinkable
beer
to
kick
back
with
all
night
long
light
watery
syrup
feel
with
tannic
texture
into
the
finish
mild
carbonation
appearance
this
second
time
was
more
impressive
looks
like
i
just
poured
a
coke
lots
of
tan
foam
that
laces
very
nicely
in
my
only
clean
stella
artois
glass
some
toastiness
in
the
nose
that
pushes
this
up
to
good
not
blasting
it
but
i
bet
as
it
warms
it
releases
and
reveals
more
taste
i
gave
it
a
3
5
last
year
in
may
catching
more
flavor
and
more
bitterness
mouthfeel
too
seems
quite
different
not
so
thin
but
a
little
more
crisp
quite
enjoyable
this
time
and
very
drinkable
much
better
than
becks
dark
d
if
theres
one
thing
harpoon
knows
how
to
do
its
make
a
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
despite
being
a
dark
beer
this
ones
no
exception
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
but
is
clear
enough
and
still
enough
that
you
can
almost
see
through
it
not
much
of
a
head
and
not
much
on
the
nose
either
the
taste
is
nice
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
character
i
believe
i
can
detect
a
little
bit
of
a
caramel
malt
type
of
flavor
in
the
undertones
elegantly
simple
and
extremely
drinkable
nice
job
smooth
nutty
dark
caramel
malt
with
light
hop
citrus
in
back
crisp
carbonation
roasty
flavors
but
also
very
clean
and
balanced
ridiculously
drinkable
for
a
dark
beer
has
that
harpoon
dark
beer
butterycola
taste
if
you
take
to
long
to
drink
it
overall
munich
dark
is
consistently
my
favorite
harpoon
d
good
5
6
and
flavorful
you
cant
really
ask
for
more
i
had
this
out
of
the
harpoon
sixstyle
variety
pack
definitely
recommended
i
tried
the
brown
session
ale
and
really
enjoyed
it
but
when
i
had
this
i
found
a
similarity
they
are
both
brown
ales
but
this
is
like
the
father
of
the
two
the
smell
is
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
with
a
hint
of
caramel
it
has
a
tan
twofinger
head
with
a
decent
lace
that
slowly
fades
towards
the
end
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
exceptional
very
very
smooth
it
is
very
balanced
between
the
malts
and
hops
and
the
aftertaste
has
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
not
overbearing
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
harpoon
brew
that
i
have
tried
recommended
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
solid
brown
ale
as
well
as
anyone
who
want
to
switch
it
up
d
very
good
overall
id
drink
a
few
of
these
good
beer
basically
the
big
brother
of
harpoons
brown
session
like
this
is
the
full
flavor
and
brown
session
is
the
light
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
want
on
a
cool
day
the
fullness
and
body
warms
you
up
some
pretty
good
beer
the
darkness
would
scare
the
bmc
drinkers
but
the
mildnes
would
surprise
them
nice
body
yet
not
filling
another
good
session
beer
from
harpoon
the
drink
is
briskly
carbonated
with
a
bit
of
bubblesting
and
is
light
in
body
highly
drinkable
d
not
overpowering
would
be
a
great
session
beer
nikki
the
smell
was
malty
as
was
the
taste
i
really
was
expecting
something
different
the
ufo
from
this
pack
was
good
i
am
hoping
the
remaining
ones
are
better
than
the
munich
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
and
lot
number
of
041509308
this
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brown
with
a
small
beige
head
that
does
not
last
for
a
long
period
of
time
the
aroma
is
a
little
hoppy
and
a
bit
malty
decent
mouth
feel
the
taste
has
an
eleemnt
of
hops
i
was
kind
of
hoping
for
a
nutty
flavor
and
aroma
but
i
really
didnt
notice
any
still
it
is
a
pretty
good
brew
high
drinkability
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
one
sitting

this
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
dunkels
boy
am
i
impressed
with
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
beer
rich
aroma
of
lightly
roasted
malts
mild
chocolate
and
maybe
even
a
little
cedar
pretty
nice
pour
medium
darkness
for
the
style
nice
creamy
tan
head
and
some
solid
lacing
nice
body
and
really
smooth
easy
to
drink
flavor
is
lively
the
malt
is
headstrong
but
coupled
nicely
with
some
balancing
hop
flavors
lightly
smoked
with
a
moderate
bitterness
a
wonderful
tasty
treat
probably
one
of
the
best
harpoon
beers
that
i
have
had
and
will
look
for
in
the
future
had
in
the
harpoon
winter
sample
pack
appearance
was
a
good
solid
dark
appearance
with
a
clear
amber
hint
seen
in
the
light
decent
lacing
malty
dark
chocolate
flavors
wrapped
around
a
generally
roasted
texture
nice
and
sweet
flavor
with
an
almost
milky
texture
malts
and
chocolate
dominate
great
mouthfeel
really
helps
make
a
dry
crisp
drink
overall
great
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
pretty
light
beer
despite
it
being
called
a
dark
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
pretty
decent
mix
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
pale
ale
once
upon
a
time
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
it
still
holds
a
place
in
my
heart
for
a
simple
drinkable
mock
lager
its
got
everything
youre
looking
for
and
nothing
you
arent
its
a
shame
that
its
not
in
6
packs
anymore
d
ive
had
many
of
these
beers
which
is
a
testament
to
their
drinkability
but
in
the
end
its
just
a
decent
ale
thats
a
little
thin
i
would
suggest
it
on
tap
if
you
have
the
option
drinkability
pretty
good
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
its
worth
trying
and
isnt
bad
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
d
nice
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
dark
beer
smells
dark
tasted
somewhat
dark
mouthfeel
not
so
much
but
it
is
the
difference
that
i
liked
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
at
market
basket
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
with
a
good
half
inch
of
light
tan
head
smells
sweet
with
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
character
with
banana
and
nut
playing
roles
nut
chocolate
coffee

of

hints
at
peatiness
chocolate
dominates
the
finish
and
aftertaste
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
fullflavored
with
no
real
perceivable
flaws
a
solid
brown
ale
and
another
slam
dunk
for
harpoon
quite
enjoyable
indeedi
dont
gravitate
towards
harpoon
offerings
but
this
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
this
is
one
of
harpoons
better
beers
in
my
opinion
why
they
call
it
a
munich
dark
i
have
no
idea
also
it
seems
a
bit
closer
to
an
english
brown
maybe
ive
just
had
too
many
hoppy
american
browns
lately
than
an
american
but
either
way
it
is
a
very
solid
and
tasty
beer
and
id
certainly
enjoy
it
again
mfd
a
very
good
beer
goes
down
smooth
with
enough
flavor
to
satisfy
very
drinkable
but
in
a
lite
beer
kind
of
way
another
good
but
not
great
beer
from
harpoon
im
sort
of
confused
by
the
name
of
this
beer
as
its
an
american
brown
ale
so
how
is
it
munich
germany
type
oh
well
it
tastes
a
little
confusing
as
im
not
sure
what
type
of
beer
it
is
supposed
to
be
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
it
tastes
delicious
and
is
very
drinkable
a
big
surprise
in
the
mix
pack
for
sure
growler
from
windsor

looking
for
something
to
warm
me
up
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
mild
malts
and
coffee
in
the
aroma
some
coffee
nuts
and
caramel
flavors
but
wasnt
really
all
that
flavorful
relatively
smooth
but
a
bit
thin
and
watery
i
probably
wont
revisit
poured
a
chestnut

a
thick

good
retention
a
fine
looking

toasted

baking

are
equally
nice
deep

malty

roasted
malt

more
chocolate
as
it
warms
up
lightly
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
lots
of
dark
flavors
for
a
medium
body
beer
and
a
good
but
not
great
example
of
a
dunkel
style
easy
to
drink
and
a
better
session
beer
than
the
more
standard
brown
ale
they
offer
drinkability
was
high
this
was
just
a
tasty
well
made
brown
ale
that
i
could
really
session
served
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
poured
an
opaque
cola
brown
with
deep
red
coloration
at
the
base
of
the
glass
one
inch
offwhite
foamy
head
dissipated
into
a
solid
skim
within
30
seconds
some
watery
lacing
but
poor

nose
was
somewhat
perplexing
i
detected
malt
and
dark
fruit
taste
consistent
with
nose
as
well
as
a
mild
hops
bitterness
at
the
finish
and
presence
of
dark
chocolate
somewhere
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
fell
between
light
and
medium
with
quite
a
bit
of
effervescence
and
a
mild

at
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
throat
solid
session
brown
with
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
and
complexity
has
aroma
of
toasted
malt
with
slight
fruity
backround
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
clean
with
good
carbonation
went
down
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
an
outstanding
offering
from
harpoon
d
decently
drinkable
but
the
flavor
isnt
good
enough
to
merit
a
higher
score
d
highly
recommended
brew
nice
balance
and
wonderful
aftertaste
sessionable
and
ridiculously
tasty
other
a
solid
seasonal
brew
worthy
of
sampling
i
really
like
to
see
beers
like
this
coming
out
of
breweries
like
harpoon
makes
me
smile
had
one
on
tap
this
past
weekend
at
the
milky
way
lounge
in
jp
hadnt
seen
this
beer
on
tap
in
a
while
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
go
pours
with
a
stout
color
and
head
to
it
smelled
a
lot
like
a
porter
though
taste
was
a
lot
lighter
than
a
porter
more
like
a
dark
ale
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
different
characteristics
in
case
i
am
confusing
you
had
a
nice
roasted
barley
flavor
to
it
but
was
a
lot
smoother
that
i
remembered
while
harpoons
brown
ale
is
smooth
and
considered
their
session
beer
this
version
of
a
dark
ale
is
much
better
to
sip
and
enjoy
i
forgot
until
this
past
weekend
how
much
i
like
this
beer
d
very
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
for
rotation
in
my
everyday
stash
this
brew
poured
to
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
creamy
head
that
had
a
medium
tan
color
the
retention
was
good
and
left
some
nice
lace
rings
down
the
side
of
the
glass
to
me
the
aroma
was
excellent
with
a
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
scent
that
was
incredibly
inviting
i
notice
a
slight
hop
aroma
that
would
seem
to
have
a
floral
accent
the
flavor
is
very
good
as
well
the
chocolate
that
was
identified
in
the
nose
comes
out
nicely
in
the
flavor
as
well
and
seems
to
give
a
slight
sweet
flavor
also
what
i
had
identified
as
roasted
malts
seem
to
be
a
little
more
harsh
in
the
flavor
slight
astringency
comes
out
but
is
welcome
the
feel
of
this
brew
is
creamy
at
the
start
but
finishes
somewhat
dry
slight
hop
finish
to
this
brew
which
seems
to
be
in
proportion
of
what
i
expected
from
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
todate
my
favorite
from
harpoon
very
drinkable
and
very
well
done
i
would
rate
this
at
a
4
at
best
this
dark
bavarian
inspired
beer
pours
a
very
dark
copper
color
with
a
dark
ruby
red
hue
a
big
frothy
tan
head
sits
on
top
which
hangs
out
for
awhile
and
left
behind
delicate
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
with
a
light
hopy
and
nutty
character
its
flavor
is
full
of
dark
sweet
malts
there
are
burnt
caramel
dark
toast
and
chocolate
notes
over
a
moderately
bitter
hops
the
malt
sweetness
lingers
into
the
finish
it
has
nice
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
a
silky
smooth
texture
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
defiantly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
dark
munich
style
beers
d
a
nice
beer
well
crafted
pours
fairly
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
and
spotty
lacing
pretty
nice
looking
beer
dry
and
coppery
aromas
and
slightly
spicy
malt
in
the
nose
taste
is
als
redolent
with
firm
malt
tangy
and
coppery
with
a
dry
rumraisin
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
chewy
not
all
that
smooth
and
a
bit
grainy
fairly
decent
sesion
beer
but
lacks
some
interest
light
to
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
and
a
little
chewy
this
is
a
fairly
round
and
balanced
beer
and
while
not
outstanding
it
is
a
bit
of
a
departure
for
the
style
and
a
very
nice
surprise
d
very
drinkable
and
a
good
representation
of
style
not
the
one
listed
i
really
dont
get
how
this
is
an
american
brown
ale
a
very
drinkable
beer
alcohol
is
undetectable
and
overall
its
just
a
damn
smooth
drinking
beer
with
not
a
lot
in
the
way
of
character
the
beer
just
isnt
big
in
any
way
the
malts
are
there
the
bittering
chocolate
is
there
but
nothing
ever
comes
out
in
full
force
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
but
this
is
just
too
reserved
of
a
brown
ale
for
my
tastes
munich
style
or
not
d
the
grains
hops
and
roasted
malts
are
balanced
very
well
to
give
a
great
experience
drinking
this
beer
by
far
my
favorite
beer
harpoon
makes
this
is
a
beer
that
i
take
my
time
drinking
and
seems
to
become
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
doverall
the
beer
was
good
but
the
smokiness
seems
to
make
me
only
want
a
single
serving
i
really
did
like
the
burnt
caramel
flavoring
not
one
of
harpoons
finer
moments
i
tried
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
among
the
8
or
so
other
beers
this
was
by
far
my
favorite
a
nice
coffee
smell
with
a
nice
balance
of
hopsmalt
this
was
certainly
a
lighter
bodied
beer
than
i
expected
but
still
a
solid
medium
bodied
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
even
purchased
a
growler
to
go
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
nice
brown
ale
taste
aggressive
pour
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
yielded
very
small
light
brown
head
it
quickly
disappeared
leaving
just
a
ring
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
and
no
lacing
couldnt
pick
out
any
one
scent
but
had
an
earthy
topsoil
odor
and
at
some
point
in
time
i
noticed
a
sort
of
sweet
honey
scent
that
didnt
last
long
looked
jetblack
but
with
a
closer
look
i
could
see
dark
brown
around
the
edges
tasted
light
and
smooth
at
first
not
much
carbonation
followed
by
burnt
malts
and
left
a
dry
dark
coffee
flavor
in
my
mouth
thanks
to
beer
of
the
month
club
for
another
good
brew
that
i
probably
would
not
have
tried
on
my
own
tasted
on
22508
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
very
dark
beer
with
a
really
big
fat
tan
head
that
was
really
nice
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
slightly
roasted
the
taste
however
was
harsh
i
thought
on
the
finish
sort
of
chemically
tasting
aftertaste
i
will
not
buy
again
d
quite
drinkabe
and
tasty
a
decent
ale
that
i
would
have
again
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
id
like
to
try
it
with
some
hearty
food
like
chilli
and
see
how
well
it
plays
as
a
companion
i
think
it
would
work
well
d
this
beer
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
nice
example
of
the
style
living
most
of
my
life
in
various
parts
of
the
midwest
this
is
my
first
try
of
a
harpoon
made
beer
and
its
made
a
decent
impression
on
me
ill
sure
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
of
from
this
brewery
the
beer
poured
out
clear
deep
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
and
possessed
a
two
finger
thick
head
made
of
rough
foam
the
smell
was
mild
and
a
little
toasty
the
taste
was
a
lot
less
sweet
than
i
recall
becks
dark
ever
being
the
roasty
charred
malt
character
was
apparent
in
a
dry
chocolaty
and
astringent
flavor
the
body
was
light
and
creamy
but
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
harsh
very
little
hops
present
as
well
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
glad
i
have
moved
on
drinkability
very
smooth
and
drinkable
this
is
my
first
offering
from
harpoon
and
im
impressed
doesnt
really
fit
the
munich
style
but
its
a
good
dark
malty
beer
di
didnt
realize
until
the
review
that
this
was
actually
a
brown
ale
i
half
expected
some
german
type
of
dunkel
knowing
that
its
a
brown
ale
helps
its
very
good
for
a
brown
ale
complex
and
certainly
not
one
dimensional
like
other
browns
dark
malts
but
not
rich
some
fruity
esters
and
earthy
grape
all
in
both
the
scent
and
taste
slight
crisp
hoppiness
on
the
finish
but
never
overpowering
the
malts
very
smooth
and
clean
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
harpoon
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
all
sorts
of
foods
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
call
it
a
munich
type
dark
beer
but
its
not
a
lager
its
actually
an
ale
which
ba
picks
up
on
and
points
out
and
while
thats
a
bit
misleading
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
makes
a
dandy
little
brown
ale
as
far
as
im
concerned
real
nutty
and
smoky
and
the
roasted
coffee
sensation
really
does
well
not
for
everyone
but
not
bad
harpoon
munich
dark
pours
dark
brown
black
with
a
foamy
head
that
lingers
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
chocolatey
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
the
dark
malts
upfront
followed
by
some
hop
bitterness
and
an
odd
green
earthy
flavor
maybe
its
hop
flavor
but
it
tastes
a
bit
different
to
me
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
from
harpoon
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
mix
pack
dthis
beer
has
some
dark
malt
qualities
but
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
lagered
flavor
this
beer
is
great
for
a
session
beer
with
some
character
decent
but
not
worth
seeking
out
unless
its
your
thing
a
good
representation
of
the
style
from
one
of
new
englands
more
renowned
and
reliable
brewers
glad
they
threw
it
in
the
sampler
otherwise
i
probably
wouldnt
have
sought
it
out
pours
a
crystal
clear
brown
with
a
very
strong
red
highlight
muted
nose
with
little
to
it
taste
is
thick
with
what
i
can
only
describe
as
an
oil
edge
to
it
on
the
start
changes
into
a
very
long
lasting
flavor
adventure
over
time
i
get
hints
of
roasted
coffee
worth
trying
as
much
for
the
complexity
of
flavors
as
anything
else
definitely
worth
going
back
to
again
though
id
say
best
in
the
company
of
fellow
beer
snob
friends
so
as
to
go
over
its
finer
points
of
style
very
good
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
picked
up
their
sampler
tonite
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
w
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
which
dissapates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
a
rather
vinous
and
alcoholic
nose
w
a
slight
hop
undertone
in
there
a
strong
smoky
malt
flavor
almost
too
much
smoke
but
right
under
the
wire
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
and
diacetyl
as
well
a
good
overall
flavor
throughout
a
rather
light
mouthfeel
for
a
5
6
abv
though
true
to
the
style
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
too
not
an
undrinkable
beer
though
the
smokieness
does
become
a
bit
much
after
a
few
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
harpoon
beers
it
pours
a
nice
dark
dark
brown
from
the
bottle
with
a
large
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
has
a
really
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
that
has
a
smokey
hint
about
it
the
taste
is
excellent
very
dark
very
roasty
a
little
bit
smokey
but
overall
a
very
nice
blend
of
malts
and
some
light
hops
to
make
this
a
very
flavorful
beer
what
i
like
best
is
that
for
how
dark
it
is
it
is
a
very
light
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
it
feels
good
going
down
and
i
absolutely
loved
it
i
wish
that
the
harpoon
booth
had
cracked
this
one
open
during
session
1
of
the
belgian
beer
fest
but
alas
they
didnt
theres
always
next
year
very
quaffable
the
lighter
than
expected
mouthfeel
probably
helps
in
this
regard
just
seems
like
a
very
wellbalanced
brew
all
the
way
around
from
johnnnniee
in
the
2007
secret
halloween

thanks
guy
drinkability
very
nice
although
there
are
better
brown
ales
out
there
worth
trying
but
not
worth
pursuing
a
decent
brown
ale
the
beer
poured
a
fine
dark
amber
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
aroma
was
a
full
bodied
sweet
malt
the
taste
starts
with
a
rich
sweet
malt
and
then
gets
a
big
hit
of
hops
the
feel
is
medium
and
wet
a
decent
session
beer
but
not
one
i
will
spend
a
lot
of
time
searching
out
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
tan
head
of
about
one
inch
the
color
of
this
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
when
held
up
to
the
light
close
to
being
opaque
smells
of
toasty
malt
with
some
smokiness
tastes
of
roated
malts
and
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
flavor
a
little
smokey
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
easy
to
drink
and
would
definately
purchase
again
this
is
my
favorite
harpoon
brew
i
have
tried
pour
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
dense
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
nice
cap
the
smell
is
of
carob
a
bit
smokey
a
touch
of
bitter
chocolate
the
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
some
light
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
not
sure
i
can
detect
much
hop
flavor
in
general
not
very
robust
the
feel
is
fairly
light
and
crisp
good
carbonation
a
good
malty
brew
that
is
fairly
crisp
good
for
some
autumn
drinking
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
to
keep
stocked
in
the
fridge
i
first
tried
it
at
a
tasting
at
the
harpoon
brewery
it
is
definitely
my
favorite
of
all
the
harpoon
beers
that
i
have
tried
d
very
drinkable
very
darktoasty
beer
burnt
caramel
flavor
that
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
its
an
interesting
beer
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
a
rich
dark
brown
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
less
than
an
inch
of
head
which
quickly
fades
to
a
light
lacing
of
tan
bubbles
an
aroma
of
rich
malts
with
a
slight
hop
afterthought
a
flavor
of
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
a
slight
hop
bitterness
finishes
off
the
taste
just
as
it
did
the
aroma
goes
down
smooth
though
it
does
feel
as
though
it
has
a
higher
than
average
abv
a
balanced
but
rich
fullbodied
beer
that
desires
to
be
savored
d
this
beer
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
was
not
offensive
either
i
enjoyed
the
several
i
had
but
would
not
rush
out
to
get
more
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
aromas
of
caramel
malt
in
the
taste
chocolate
and
a
bit
malty
a
tad
sweet
too
aftertastes
of
a
chocolate
malt
and
a
sweetness
that
lingers
a
big
chocolate
presence
and
sweet
but
nice
for
a
brown
ale
deep
brown
in
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
good
with
dark
roasted
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
very
slight
hop
smell
at
the
beginning
and
end
the
taste
is
rich
malty
roasted
and
smooth
im
not
sure
why
this
is
considered
an
american
brown
ale
it
tastes
exactly
like
a
schwarzbier
and
is
marked
as
a
munich
dunkel
regardless
it
is
a
great
session
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
balance
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
is
surprisingly
good
mostly
roasted
malt
but
also
some
nuttiness
and
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
good
easily
a
session
beer
overall
a
very
nice
brown
ale
i
expected
something
pretty
good
from
harpoon
but
this
surpassed
my
expectations
this
was
the
highlight
of
the
mixed
case
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
like
most
of
harpoons
selections
somewhat
underpowered
eric
d
very
good
for
an
aba
overall
this
beer
is
light
and
creamy
and
carries
5
6
abv
so
its
easily
consumed
in
sessions
good
stuff
on
tap
at
the
south
fourth
in
beer
meccaville
aka
brooklyn
ny
pours
dark
dark
amber
with
just
a
minimal
head
and
minor
lacing

sweet
nose
worthy
tasty
lager
thing
going
on
here
nice
roastedtoasted
malts
dark
caramel
notes
smooth
and
easily
sessionable
well
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
tap
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
like
the
burnt
toast
flavor
still
delicious
ive
had
this
before
ba
and
havent
had
it
again
till
yesterday
it
was
on
the
bar
menu
in
the
bottle
and
i
given
the
other
weak
choices
i
considered
myself
lucky
and
ordered
this
while
my
colleagues
talked
about
not
liking
dark
beer
i
enjoyed
a
rich
dark
brown
ale
with
a
wonderfully
sublime
cocoa
toasted
malty
smooth
brew
not
only
was
this
more
flavorful
than
i
remembered
the
bar
was
only
a
stop
before
dinner
and
being
only
5
6
i
found
it
a
wonderful
session
beer
which
did
not
weigh
me
down
for
the
evenings
festivities
definitely
a
great
session
ale
and
one
i
would
suggest
even
tasty
on
a
summer
burger
barbeque
party
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
even
if
its
not
the
best
in
the
style
i
could
drink
a
few
but
there
are
definitely
others
that
i
would
pick
first
taste
is
really
good
very
malty
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
throughout
roasted
malts
is
the
main
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
bodied
ale
that
has
alot
of
flavor
nice
level
of
carbonation
it
is
well
balanced
drinkabilitythis
is
a
nice
medium
bodied
ale
could
be
a
session
ale
depending
on
the
weather
overall
this
is
a
nice
medium
bodied
beer
with
some
really
good
flavor
to
it
not
too
thick
or
thin
just
right
for
its
classification
d
a
good
tasting
brew
that
is
a
nice
sessionable
switch
from
an
apa
or
an
ipa
very
drinkable
pours
a
dark
brown
color
here
aroma
is
very
malty
and
sweet
taste
is
somewhat
strong
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
some
sweetness
and
alcohol
flavor
to
top
it
all
off
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
dry
and
reminiscent
of
coffee
at
the
back
of
the
throat
not
too
bad
and
actually
tastes
better
than
the
brown
session
ale
ive
had
because
of
the
lighter
body
and
good
taste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
dunkel
d
this
is
a
really
good
beer
from
what
i
would
generally
consider
to
be
a
mainstream
brewery
that
lacks
in
quality
this
is
great
though
if
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
awful
i
would
have
given
it
more
here
the
combination
of
flavors
isnt
a
common
one
but
it
is
a
delicious
one
i
will
have
no
problem
choosing
this
in
the
future
i
suppose
that
it
does
pass
the
ultimate
test
though
i
can
conceive
of
a
time
when
i
would
be
craving
this
beer
and
no
other
would
satisfy
that
craving
as
maximally
that
is
a
rare
attribute
indeed
overall
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
one
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
the
nonhigh
gravity
stuff
from
these
guys
that
i
have
liked
but
this
one
is
really
good
overall
a
truely
impressive
brew
at
the
time
when
i
was
drinking
i
actually
had
no
idea
of
the
age
of
this
beer
but
i
can
certainly
say
that
it
was
stored
properly
and
i
believe
greatly
benefited
from
age
even
if
you
dont
like
brown
ales
give
this
one
a
shot
this
is
a
very
drinkable
enjoyable
brew
there
are
chocolate
and
nut
flavors
up
front
followed
by
a
hop
bite
in
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
certainly
a
sessionable
brown
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
harpoon
a
real
drinkable
brown
ale
the
full
flavor
and
creamy
mouth
make
this
one
that
drinks
easily
and
keeps
you
reaching
for
that
glass
the
beer
poured

dark
with
a
tan
head

14
inch
the
beer
smeeled
of

coffee
it
tasted
of
coffee
as
well
malty
but
not
too
sweet
it
was
not
overly
carbonated
and
had
a
nice
dry
aftertaste

balancing
the

i
would
like
this
beer
much
more
as
a
flawed
munich

rather
than
a
strange

will
change
the
yeast
clear
dark
brown
with
faint
reddish
highlights

a

with
notes

grainy

cocoa
and
a
hint
of

medium

quite
malty

wasnt
overdone

medium

low
carbonation

body
definitely
on
the
dry
side
very
nice
d
a
good
brew
when
you
want
some
dark
malts
but
want
a
session
beer
the
lighter
feel
makes
it
a
quaffer
and
the
abv
isnt
high
enough
for
a
lot
of
concern

poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
a
spicy
and
bitter
smell
that
was
quite
interesting
it
had
a
roasted
and
bitter
taste
with
a
slightly
malty
aftertaste
also
there
was
a
very
slight
notion
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
but
they
were
most
likely
used
as
a
balancer
than
to
be
present
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
it
had
a
decent
mouthfeel
although
i
expected
it
to
be
thicker
it
was
pretty
drinkable
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
stout
with
a
hint
hops
definitely
a
regular
in
my
fridge
d
high
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
this
more
often
id
love
to
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
its
simple
and
tasty

has
a
solid
brew
here
chocolate
dark
brown
malty
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
aroma

easy

well
malted

an
ok

a
very
good
american
brown
the
later
because
of
root
beer
like
secondary
tastes
well
carbonated
this
is
a
pretty
cool
beer
as
i
get
both
american
and
german
brown
influences
out
of
it
taste
of
sweet
chocolate
almost
fruity
with
a
bit
of
hops
very
smooth
and
crisp
great
for
dinner
and
possibly
dessert
looks
good
smells
good
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
bed
for
eating
crackers
smooth
and
fullbodied
with
a
rich
creamy
and
somewhat
oily
mouthfeel
good
beer
with
a
good
malty
taste
a
good
tasting
beer
not
awful
yet
not
awsome
it
went
down
very
smooth
it
wasnt
very
strong
for
a
beer
that
dark
looking
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
wasnt
even
that
dark
tasting
for
a
beer
that
looks
that
dark
i
got
this
beer
as
a
smapler
but
unless
there
was
nothing
new
to
try
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
an
entire
case
dont
drink
and
review
da
a
tasty
well
balanced
brew
featuring
a
very
drinkable
complex
malt
taste
the
smell
consists
of
roasted
caramel
malts
and
chocolately
yeast
the
flavor
profile
follws
those
lines
along
with
some
mocha
and
candy
the
mouth
is
creamy
and
smooth
its
light
and
multiple
bottles
could
certainly
be
downed
in
a
sitting
one
of
harpoons
best
drank
too
easy
a
pretty
damn
good
example
of
some
of
the
dunkles
i
had
in
dland
rich
and
balanced
but
lacking
in
overall
complexity
the
caramel
malt
coats
the
tongue
finishes
a
good
30
seconds
same
dried
fruits
as
the
nose
dominated
by
the
fig
with
hints
of
milk
chocolate
rs
hits
the
taste
buds
upon
entry
but
end
with
bitter
hoppiness
good
easy
drinker
drinkability
a
respectable
brown
ale
that
despite
its
appearance
drinks
rather
light
i
could
easily
enjoy
several
of
these
on
a
crisp
fall
afternoon
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
brown
with
some
tints
of
red
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
theres
a
decent
bit
of
lacing
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
and
caramel
it
tastes
like
malt
honey
caramel
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
its
more
sweet
than
bitter
but
it
has
a
good
mix
of
both
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
its
pretty
easy
drinking
and
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
could
make
this
a
session
beer
now
and
again
lightly
sweet
with
some
roasted
flavor
and
a
touch
of
pine
in
the
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
and
thirst
quenching
ability
make
this
a
decent
session
brew
drinkability
this
is
very
easy
to
quaff
and
can
easily
be
described
as
a
session
beer
worth
trying
especially
if
you
see
it
available
on
tap
drinkability
i
never
knew
that
this
beer
existed
until
today
and
that
is
a
shame
the
malts
are
dark
and
delicious
smooth
and
drinkable
with
a
good
notwatereddown
taste
not
too
many
subtle
undertones
though
strong
upfront
taste
not
much
by
way
of
an
aftertaste
not
bitter
nor
too
hoppy
comparable
to
a
good
sam
adams
very
nice
way
to
relax
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
thanks
to
harpoon
for
using
bottled
on
dates
i
check
them
from
the
bottle
poureddark
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
but
left
some
lacing
aroma
a
big
hit
of
caramel
than
chocolate
honey
just
a
nice
sweetness
comes
out
of
my
glass
flavor
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
and
weak
but
did
get
some
hopsand
malts
cherries
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
harpoons
beer
is
definitely
both
maltier
and
hoppier
than
the
german
dunkel
style
i
imagine
its
trying
to
represent
ba
calls
it
american
brown
ale
not
sure
if
thats
more
or
less
accurate
in
my
experience
germany
has
better
examples
of
the
former
and
id
take
brooklyns
brown
or
the
nut
brown
offerings
from
rogue
and
dogfish
head
over
this
given
the
chance
this
is
neither
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
months
nor
a
complex
and
profound
ale
but
it
is
certainly
enjoyable
if
not
particularly
special
anyway
drink
enjoy
revisit
but
i
cant
imagine
ever
falling
in
love
with
this
i
bought
a
variety
case
containing
the
ipa
ale
ufo
and
the
dark
of
the
four
this
has
the
best
character
to
it
and
the
one
ill
be
most
happy
to
stumble
upon
in
a
bar
somewhere
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
forms
and
disappears
quickly
the
scent
of
malt
totally
dominates
the
aroma
but
there
is
slight
hint
of
hops
coming
through
the
taste
starts
with
the
malt
then
a
nice
smack
off
bitterness
of
hops
come
in
right
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
heavier
than
one
would
expect
but
is
still
very
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
nice
sweet
malt
and
the
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
me
want
to
grab
another
one
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
would
personally
classify
it
as
a
brown
ale
however
one
of
harpoons
better
year
round
regular
release
beers
good
toasty
and
easily
quaffable
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
nose
with
some
citrus
hop
background
the
taste
starts
pale
on
the
tongue
syrupy
thick
with
a
great
caramel
sweetness
it
then
moves
to
a
sweet
bitter
hop
finish
surrounded
by
a
strong
malty
backbone
with
the
nice
roasted
malt
complimenting
the
entire
brew
note
have
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
am
not
a
fan
but
this
cask
version
is
fantastic
and
would
try
to
find
again
this
is
such
an
easy
drinking
beer
whenever
i
am
at
one
of
harpoons
festivals
i
am
usually
sessioning
it
my
favorite
of
their
regular
lineup
im
not
sure
if
this
is
really
an
american
brown
ale
as
it
is
true
to
form
of
a
german
style
brew
it
is
a
little
light
in
the
body
for
this
style
looks
decent
a
foamy
head
no
lacing
some
chocolate
and
maybe
cocoa
going
on
here
however
light
drinkability
is
very
good
as
it
finishes
smoothly
with
a
slight
slight
bitterness
a
decent
session
brew
especially
for
the
fall
or
winter
harpoon
continues
to
make
nice
mass
produced
beers
this
one
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
harpoon
a
dark
slightly
hoppy
smooth
dark
ale
that
is
not
too
heavy
it
has
enough
flavors
that
one
can
uncover
some
mysteries
over
a
few
glasses
although
the
head
is
a
little
thin
for
its
style
it
is
by
no
means
absent
i
will
come
back
to
you
my
friend
this
beer
is
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
semisweet
with
a
nut
brown
hint
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
and
somewhat
medicinal
the
mouthfeel
is
a
lingering
bitterness
that
is
just
not
quite
up
to
par
the
drinkability
is
fair
i
could
have
another
but
i
dont
think
i
would
session
these
this
is
a
beer
that
has
far
exceeded
my
expectations
a
very
nice
dark
session
beer
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
auburn
on
the
sides
nice
sized
creamy
tan
head
rises
above
the
glass
falls
fast
but
leaves
a
nice
pattern
of
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
but
quite
nutty
from
what
im
getting
a
bit
roasty
as
well
taste
is
smooth
with
malt
accents
toasty
flavors
dominate
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
providing
the
sweetness
creamy
body
is
enjoyable
yet
too
thin
carbonation
is
a
little
too
much
a
slight
fruity
flavor
from
the
hops
comes
but
is
drowned
out
by
the
weaker
mouthfeel
ends
dry
with
a
bitter
chocolate
flavor
this
was
really
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
cheers
this
is
a
solid
malty
beer
from
harpoon
its
nothing
all
that
remarkable
but
it
could
be
very
enjoyable
with
a
meal
enjoyable
and
sessionable
a
solid
beer
all
around
and
great
fresh
from
the
brewery
as
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
from
harpoons
regular
offerings
drinkability
i
enjoy
the
heck
out
of
these
one
of
my
favorites
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
poured
a
clear
rich
dark
reddish
brown
color
reminiscent
of
cocacola
into
a
pint
glass
left
a
full
finger
off
white
head
that
slowly
fell
to
light
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
rich
roasty
malt
and
caramel
along
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
taste
is
primarily
led
by
sweet
roasted
malt
slight
coffee
flavor
present
as
well
starts
off
with
a
creamy
smooth
sweetness
before
roughing
up
the
palette
with
a
roasty
coffee
bitterness
that
washes
the
tongue
well
mouthfeel
is
lighter
to
medium
bodied
lower
levels
of
carbonation
leaves
a
slight
slick
oily
feeling
along
with
the
slightly
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
would
consider
this
an
enjoyable
beer
with
a
nice
level
of
complexity
without
any
frills
overall
a
pretty
decent
drink
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
harpoon
offerings
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
is
roasty
with
a
tough
of
caramel
it
tastes
good
but
i
that
it
is
not
as
rich
as
it
could
be
it
is
just
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
i
taste
roasty
coffee
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
toffee
overall
it
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
if
unspectacular
brown
ale
thanks
bashiba
for
handing
this
one
over
oim
partial
to
these
brews
and
this
one
was
a
good
drink
will
definately
revisit
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
almost
opaque
brown
with
a
frothy
tan
head
there
is
not
too
much
lacing
but
a
thin
frothy
film
stays
the
whole
way
down
the
beer
the
smell
is
rather
strong
smell
of
roasted
malts
with
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
the
taste
is
also
strong
with
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
but
it
is
also
balanced
nicely
with
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
this
beer
is
nicely
thick
and
carbonated
makeing
for
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
overall
i
really
do
enjoy
this
beer
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
porter
with
the
strong
roasted
malt
flavors
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
not
a
bad
brew
but
rather
tame
in
terms
of
aroma
and
flavor
not
one
ill
remember
in
a
few
days
i
can
drink
this
easily
enough
but
its
just
nothing
special
well
as
ive
said
before
as
an
american
brown
ale
this
works
for
me
its
fruity
hoppy
nutty
a
little
with
a
good
dark
malt
character
just
dont
judge
the
book
by
its
cover
this
pours
a
darkdark
brown
with
a
large
two
finger
head
the
smell
is
weak
and
just
a
hint
of
yeast
and
nuts
the
taste
is
okbut
not
great
there
is
a
little
malt
and
nuttinessbut
not
much
the
mf
is
lightbut
full
flavoredwith
little
flavor
there
is
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
average
beer
from
a
very
average
brewery
that
is
not
always
a
good
thing
and
certainly
not
with
this
ale
drinkability
is
decent
perhaps
a
bit
drier
than
i
like
but
nice
flavor
not
bad
a
nice
chocolate
malt
flavor
with
a
reasonable
hop
balance
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
decent
if
a
little
thin
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
and
didnt
love
it
but
i
am
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
right
now
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
munich
style
dark
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
labeling
this
as
a
munich
dark
is
an
insult
to
the
great
city
of
munich
im
not
sure
how
this
is
one
of
harpoons
award
winning
beers
who
judged
the
ceo
harpoon
brews
some
solid
offerings
paricullary
the
ipa
and
weizen
which
i
quite
enjoy
totally
disapointed
with
this
beer
being
october
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
germanic
offering
this
was
one
of
the
days
i
wish
i
lived
in
a
state
that
sold
by
sixpacksshould
have
paid
more
and
selected
that
case
of
ayinger
instead
head
was
nonapparent
flavor
was
not
bold
as
a
dark
should
represent
particually
weak
on
malt
taste
and
moutheel
can
best
be
summed
up
as
weak
and
watery
as
you
may
have
detected
im
upset
that
i
bought
a
case
of
this
beer
ive
been
pleased
with
harpoon
in
the
past
but
am
very
dissapointed
with
this
beer
even
tested
a
second
to
give
the
brewery
another
chance
anyone
interested
in
22
free
munich
dark
bottles
theyll
be
at
my
curb
tomorrow
morning
i
do
not
typically
like
the
offerings
from
harpoon
theyve
always
come
across
as
a
sams
wannabe
that
overall
just
isnt
as
good
however
this
is
a
tasty
brew
which
i
like
this
beer
would
have
benefited
from
some
form
of
spicy
or
sharp
food
along
with
it
alone
it
tends
to
dissapear
but
i
did
drink
it
rather
quickly
i
was
looking
for
a
touch
more
hop
character
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
one
it
has
average
drinkability
but
nothing
redeeming
theres
many
other
better
examples
of
this
style
and
i
suggest
you
go
there
first
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
one
of
the
better
harpoon
brews
pours
a
nice
mahogany
or
even
darker
color
and
an
okay
head
taste
is
nice
and
quite
smoky
in
my
opinion
woody
carmely
flavors
are
also
quite
prominent
quite
drinkable
as
this
beer
is
not
too
heavy
in
mouthfeel
recommended
drinkability
is
fair
not
the
best
of
the
bunch
overallgreat
job
here
harpoon
im
much
more
impressed
by
this
then
with
the
i
p
a
one
of
the
better
darkstyles
ales
ive
had
in
awhile
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
recommend
it
for
a
good
session
brew
poured
a
medium
color
with
offwhite
foamy
head
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
with
hints
of
dark
fruitiness
taste
is
slightly
of
caramel
with
fruity
maltiness
finish
is
a
bit
sweet
but
not
overly
unpleasant
nice
drinker
i
need
to
dry
more
of
this
style
beer
drinkability
its
an
okay
beer
it
tastes
good
and
is
quite
smooth
it
just
lacks
in
complexity
and
interesting
character
rich
dark
brown
and
a
light
brown
head
the
head
has
good
lacing
and
stays
around
for
the
life
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malts
and
faint
sweet
fruitiness
the
taste
is
roasted
malt
up
front
but
is
balanced
by
a
little
bit
of
spicy
hop
has
a
nice
fruity
aftertaste
silky
meduimfull
body
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
love
this
beer
i
just
wish
they
sold
it
in
six
packs
around
my
area

subtle

on

tartness
feels
good
in
the
mouth
straightforward
flavors
that
are
balanced
somewhat
filling
consistent
not
overpowering
not
remarkable
but
solid
drinkability
this
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
on
crack
to
me
or
at
least
a
brown
ale
mixed
with
day
old
burnt
coffee
grounds
again
a
good
thing
or
different
at
least
im
not
much
of
a
brown
drinker
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
impression
could
be
mistaken
for
a
light
porter
a
well
balanced
bold
beer
cant
complain
pours
quite
dark
with
a
half
finger
very
creamy
tan
head
lightly
carbonated
lightly
smell
a
spicy
hop
a
little
roasty
and
a
little
chocolate
as
well
as
malt
mouthfeel
that
says
i
am
not
water
very
balanced
beer
nothing
overpowers
so
you
can
really
enjoy
all
the
elements
dark
subtle
red
spot
or
two
shining
through
nice
light

with
sticky
lacing
some
bubbly
clusters
on
the
surface
scent
is
unappealing
a
sour
mash
of
malta
and
wheat
that
evokes
hints
of
vomit
not
as
bad
as
it
sounds
just
something
odd
that
strikes
up
a
sense
memory
perhaps
unfortunate
is
the
right
word
nice
choc
malt
in
the
flavor
exuding
dominance
slight
coffeetinged
dopplebock
notes
as
well
mildness
pulls
through
in
the
finish
and
fades
into
a
lightlyhopped
drinkable
ale
some
vanilla
left
over
as
well
in
the
aftertaste
just
dont
smell
it
before
it
hits
your
tongue
this
is
a
dark
brown
brew
with
ruby
tones
not
much
of
a
head
with
the
pour
nose
is
of
bavarian
hops
and
not
much
else
taste
started
somewhat
nutty
but
i
am
tasting
a
carmelly
malt
as
i
delve
further
into
the
glass
there
is
not
much
evidence
of
those
hops
i
noted
earlier
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
overall
this
brew
is
fairly
good
and
would
not
refuse
one
if
offered
this
is
a
good
beer
and
will
have
another
if
the
situation
arises
nice
rich
toasted
malt

cocoa

overpowering

is

and
the
body
is
moderately
light
chocolate
malt
caramel
and
woody
flavors
up
front
are
barely
sweet
the
flavor
dries
out
due
to
a
dark
malt
bitterness
that
kicks
in
midway
the
dry
bitterness
increases
towards
the
end
as
its
joined
by
some
hop
bitterness
some
cocoa
in
the
finish
and
a
lingering
bitterness
id
prefer
just
a
bit
more
body
with
the
dry
dark
malt
flavors
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
but
maybe
thats
the
way
it
was
designed
nice
flavor

easy
drinking

into
the
glass
with
an
offwhite
one
finger
head
moderate
carbonation
and
some
nice
lacing
that
dissapates
quickly
the
beer
is
dark

and
appears
a
crystal
ruby
red
when
held
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
with
a
roasty
sweetness
and
a
slight
bready
aroma
the
taste
begins
with
a
roasted
malt
flavor
and
is
exactly
like
a
porter
save
for
the
lighter
mouthfeel
initially
then
it
segues
into
a
caramel
maltiness
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
and
dry

finish
brown
ales
have
never
been
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
really
well
put
togeather
beer
easily
drinkable
and
smooth
light
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
a
winner
in
my
book
fine
a
very
tasty
and
well
rounded
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
formed
a
34
light
tan
head
above
the
reddish
dark
amber
brew
head
stays
awhile
remaining
foamy
and
dense
and
lacing
is
average
to
good
aroma
is
roasty
grains
taste
starts
with
the
sweet
dark
malts
which
is
tempered
well
by
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
nice
on
this
smooth
offering
from
harpoon
check
it
out
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
red
nice
thick
head
that
doesnt
fade
away
has
a
excellent
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
nuts
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
very
smooth
comparable
to
new
castle
has
a
good
nutty
taste
drinkability
is
quite
high
and
i
might
even
like
it
more
than
new
castle
probably
a
bit
more
on
the
hoppy
side
for
this
style
but
great
malt
presence
very
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
the
dark
malts
come
through
as
a
slight
but
subtle
coffeechocolate
flavor
only
wish
more
microbrews
would
give
a
shot
at
this
style
just
too
many
ales
out
there
perhaps
the
swill
that
is
out
there
by
the
big
3
is
why
but
there
are
many
many
good
lagers
out
unfortunately
most
arent
available
unless
you
go
overseas
to
germany
or
pennsylvania
brewing
in
pittsburgh
i
tip
my
hat
off
to
harpoon
for
doing
what
most
micros
havent
done
brew
a
good
lager
pours
out
to
be
a
dark
dark
brown
thus
the
dark
eh
with
a
smallish
tan
head
smooth
and
malty
like
sweet
and
mellow
perhaps
lacking
a
bit
in
balance
still
though
a
decent
brew
but
better
on
tap
me
thinks
beer
is
worth
checking
out
when
available
perhaps
this
is
a
bad
batch
but
per
this
bottle
im
not
yearning
for
another
pleasing
to
drink
well
asserted
absolutely
nothing
over
the
top
but
tasty
nonetheless
well
balanced
by
every
measure
the
body
is
very
deep
brown
with
a
faint
transparency
and
a
small
tannish
head
the
smell
was
enticing
chocolatecocoa
that
you
could
smell
from
a
good
foot
or
two
away
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
a
nice
full
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
somewhere
in
the
background
there
is
a
pleasant
slight
toastedness
that
is
very
complimentary
the
finish
transfers
to
a
nuttier
flavor
but
still
overall
quenching
i
found
this
an
extremely
pleasurable
beer
a
nice
brown
ale
but
i
wish
they
could
fix
the
sweetness
in
this
one
but
do
try
this
pours
very

some

not
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewery
which
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
for
a
hot
day
without
the
weight
of
typical
darker
ales
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
can
be
easily
consumed
repeatedly
not
that
id
recommend
that
drinkability
is
a
little
off
because
of
the
better
kick
and
offflavor
hints
but
for
the
style
its
pretty
good
notes
up
to
this
point
id
always
associated
harpoon
with
ipa
no
more
ill
seek
it
out
no
head
to
sit
atop
the
very
dark
brown
ale
virtually
no
smell
that
i
could
tell
the
taste
was
nutty
but
a
slightly
sweet
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
the
malt
lasted
a
good
while
longer
roasted
nuts
and
a
well
balanced
sweetness
leads
me
to
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
harpoon
bottom
line
if
this
was
all
i
ever
had
to
drink
i
might
be
sad
that
i
couldnt
drink
all
those
other
wonderful
beers
but
would
be
satisfied
with
the
one
remainging
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
from
harpoon
this
beer
doesnt
leave
a
noteworthy
impression
on
me
its
good
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
local
brewery
this
was
a
good
drinking
beer
without
a
doubt
served
in
a
large
mug
at
the
union
oyster
house
this
headless
black
beer
offered
a
subtle
roast
aroma
the
flavors
of
chocolate
coffee
and
subtle
fruit
notes
were
enjoyable
but
a
bit
understated
the
brew
was
a
bit
too
watery
and
a
tad
insubstantial
it
was
drinkable
but
not
worthy
of
pursuit
medium
bodied
notes
not
as
good
as
some
other
harpoon
brews
i
think
they
let
us
down
with
this
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
crystal
maltmunich
malt
aroma
that
is
good
but
nothing
special
it
is
a
bit
fruity
and
malty
sweet
the
taste
is
good
it
is
smooth
and
full
of
sweet
malty
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium

with

carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
its
full
of
sweetness
and
has
a
smooth
semilight
feel
this
ale
poured
a
deep
red
chestnut
color
with
tan
foam
the
smell
was
modest
with
some
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
licorice
the
taste
was
lightly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
licorice
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
and
a
tangy
aftertaste
this
was
a
nice
ale
on

this
is
a
good

damn

not
a

but
this
one
stands
out
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
harpoon
yet
it
is
god
enough
to
be
their
flaggship
beer
i
wish
it
was
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
this
one
more
often
i
increased
the
ratings
for
taste
and
drinkability
by
0
5
each
i
was
veryy
impressed
with
this
brew
after
trying
it
again
a
few
years
after
my
initial
review
roasted
malt
flavor
and
aroma
and
very
drinkable
a
nice
dark
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
still
a
good
beer
though
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
the
bottle
probably
my
least
favorite
of
styles
this
brew
is
simple
straighforward
and
dull
this
style
has
always
seemed
like
a
crossover
between
domestic
swill
and
real
craft
beer
kinda
like
the
stuff
your
friends
drank
in
college
to
be
sophisticated
e
gheiny
dark
leiny
or
st
pauli
girl
dark
not
bad
but
something
im
thoroughly
not
interested
in
ever
drinking
again
drinkability

a
nice
attempt
at
an
extremely
difficult
style
i
havent
had
a
us
dark
ale
yet
thats
gotten
to
4
0
in
my
book
this
one
was
better
than
most
my
favorite
so
far
from
harpoon
ill
definitely
buy
some
more
of
this
deep
brown
with
amber
hues
a
good
deal
of
sticky
head
to
be
had
with
a
bit
of
wrist
action
otherwise
it
fades
fairly
quickly
aromatics
are
fruity
and
a
touch
cheesyin
the
blue
cheese
vein
some
melted
chocolate
aromas
come
to
mind
as
well
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
malt
driven
and
nicely
bitter
as
it
finishes
flavors
are
also
in
a
fruity
vein
and
blue
cheesy
as
well
gosh
darned
it
this
would
be
nice
with
a
hot
dog
only
a
sausage
in
the
bun
and
make
that
sausage
something
gamey
like
venison
or
duck
and
top
it
with
a
blue
cheese
sauce
make
sure
the
sausage
contains
some
type
of
fruit
never
review
when
hungry
this
one
showed
up
in
the
december
beer
of
the
month
club
shipment
havent
really
seen
it
in

here
in

so
it

light

bitterness
emerges
midpalate
that
builds
into
a
fairly
bitter
finish
unlike
other
dunkels
ive
had
perhaps
because
its
a
topfermented
ale
interesting
but
im
not
sure
i
like
it
definitely
an
interesting
beer
its
not
often
you
come
across
a
munich
style
dunkel
thats
an
ale
as
opposed
to
lager
but
none
the
less
tasty
it
actually
tastes
more

a
porter
than
munich

this
beer
is
a
little
sharp
on
the
front
buy
mellows
a
bit
later
on
there
is
a
blend
of
sweet
malt
caramel
coffee
and
some
hops
in
the
flavor
but
none
in
abundance
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
overall
this
beer
seems
kind
of
lackluster
this
is
a
just
a
slightly
above
average
dark
ale
from
the
fine
folks
over
at
harpoon
this
beer
was
a
nice
dark
brown
colour
with
a
tan
head
the
aromas
were
very
simplistic
and
one
dimensional
consisting
only
of
malts
the
taste
was
malty
and
well
balanced
but
boring
the
mouthfeel
was
right
and
the
drinkability
was
nice
just
not
a
lot
going
on
here
with
this
beer
poured
nice
and
dark
with
lively
carbonation
some
roasted
malt
and
slight
sweetness
but
not
much
depth
to
the
flavor
profile
rather
monotone
some
light
acidity
at
the
finish
to
dry
it
up
a
bit
not
at
all
an
unpleasant
beer
but
it
did
not
hold
my
interest
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
crispness
but
is
not
as
dry
as
desired
much
less
drinkable
at
the
end
than
it
began
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
tasty
brew
and
only
wish
the
malty
flavor
was
a
little
bit
stronger
this
beer
poured
a
dark
caramel
wood
colored
that
was
crystal
clear
and
decently
carbonated
it
produced
a
dark
beigetan
colored
head
that
was
thick
sticky
well
lasting
there
was
some
sticky
chunky
lace
left
behind
the
aromas
were
of
toasted
grains
dark
malts
roasted
malt
some
light
fruit
present
and
hints
of
alcohol
became
as
it
warmed
fresh
and
clean
the
flavors
that
came
through
were
of
roasted
malts
and
burnt
caramel
nuts
toasted
touches
of
coffee
earthy
tones
grains
toasted
hops
sweet
dark
fruits
and
at
the
end
hints
of
alcohol
the
aftertaste
is
of
toasted
grains
and
some
sweetness
medium
bodied
sweet
dry
and
complex
great
flavors
of
malts
come
out
in
this
beer
while
mixing
in
other
flavors
like
hops
and
sweet
fruit
a
really
good
beer
that
as
it
warmed
it
got
more
complex
and
better
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
would
buy
the
mix
pack
again
very
nice
dark
appearance
with
a
small
head
taste
was
a
bit
sweet
with
nice
malty
flavors
medium
mouthfell
with
a
bit
of
a
chewy
quality
goes
down
very
smooth
woith
a
nice
malty
aftertone
smell
was
malty
with
slight
alcohol
shadings
very
tasty
reminded
me
of
sam
adams
double
bock
but
without
the
strong
alcohol
taste
a
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
brew
at
the
brewery
typical
looking
dark
german
beer
with
a
wee
small
tan
head
of
foam
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
sweetness
something
was
different
about
this
beer
and
i
found
out
afterwards
that
they
ferment
this
as
an
ale
instead
of
the
traditional
lager
i
think
this
really
changes
the
character
a
bit
not
as
sweet
as
the
german
dunkels
in
my
opinion
medium
bodied
and
malty
pretty
decent
beer
that
i
enjoyed
arrives
looking
sort
of
an
ochre
brownish
color
with
a
thick
almond
colored
head
nice
and
clear
with
a
semi
roasty
malty
aroma
some
hopping
is
apparent
but
its
mostly
smelling
like
a
brown
ale
or
some
kind
of
dark
ale
flavor
is
malty
a
little
grainy
with
some
fruity
esteriness
a
touch
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
and
some
plum
and
apple
flavors
hops
lend
a
mild
bite
and
dryness
to
the
finish
very
downplayed
and
works
well
with
the
malting
sort
of
uncomplex
simple
definitely
good
but
not
really
the
most
interesting
beer
flavors
arent
the
cleanest
and
dont
stand
out
from
each
other
thats
fine
because
not
all
of
beers
pleasures
are
masterpieces
of
a
brewers
art
ya
know
overall
impression
the
first
bottle
of
this
i
really
enjoyed
by
the
third
time
i
tasted
at
least
a
week
later
my
overall
impression
has
changed
a
bit
this
is
a
nice
brown
beer
being
very
creamy
and
full
flavored
are
its
best
2
qualities
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
finish
of
this
beer
however
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
quality
brew
this
one
poured
a
nice
brown
color
with
some
slight
red
highlights
in
therenice
malty
aroma
of
chocolate
and
some
slight
fruity
tones
as
well
a
very
appetizing
brew
malty
sweet
with
some
lingering
fruitiness
i
think
the
best
offering
from
harpoonvery
nice
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
that
rises
up
a
half
inch
of
thick
foam
and
sinks
quickly
as
many
small
bubbles
rise
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
dark
malt
molasses
and
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
leads
to
a
roasty
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
yeast
undercurrent
theres
some
cocoa
and
caramel
ripe
plum
and
fig
and
a
metallic
tinge
in
the
finish
well
my
last
review
of
harpoon
was
pretty
scathing
so
when
a
free
sample
of
this
popped
up
i
was
initially
skeptical
and
then
pleasantly
surprised
this
along
with
their
oktoberfest
is
the
best
thing
they
offer
which
is
strange
in
that
it
means
their
strong
suit
is
brewing
fake
germanlagerstyle
ales
anyway
this
is
a
nice
roasty
dark
ale
with
definite
dunkel
qualities
caramel
nuts
a
vague
hint
of
chocolate
alongside
some
more
fruity
ale
characteristics
its
an
unusual
marriage
but
it
just
about
works
especially
with
the
additional
twist
of
spicy
hops
those
reviewers
below
who
said
to
let
it
warm
up
are
right
on
this
went
nicely
with
ribs
i
would
definitely
turn
to
this
again
if
i
was
craving
a
german
dunkel
and
this
was
all
that
was
available
otherwise
it
is
a
strange
but
quaffable
hybrid
of
a
dunkel
and
a
brown
ale
on
a
side
note
this
isnt
a
lager
after
all
despite
the
germanic
name
dont
let
that
dissuade
you
though
on
tap
this
is
a
great
dark
ale
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
somewhat
light
on
the
palate
for
such
a
dark
beer
not
creamy
but
not
at
all
astringent
either
i
found
that
the
body
was
excellent
and
not
overpowering
considering
the
bold
nature
of
the
taste
very
drinkable
and
smooth
easy
going
down
and
i
hardly
noticed
the
alcohol
very
drinkable
in
fact
id
say
its
one
of
harpoons
best
at
least
for
their
windsor
vt
brewery
vaguely
reminiscent
of
the
dunkels
ive
enjoyed
on
a
pleasant
summer
evening
in
a
munich
beer
garden
which
is
what
they
appear
to
be
trying
to
reproduce
drinkability
notes
the
darkest
of
the
harpoon
brand
and
my
favourite
as
well
a
concrete
brew
in
my
book
a
great
beer
to
have
around
to
drink
pair
and
even
cook
with
cheers

notes
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
as
enjoyable
as
it
is
complex
dark
delicious
as
the
label
states
tip
let
the
beer
warm
a
bit
before
drinking
for
the
best
flavour
o
drinkable
but
doesnt
quite
mesh
like
the
classic
german
examples
i
enjoyed
this
beer
from
a
bottle
was
good
copper
color
with
nice
malty
aromas
tasted
good
but
was
hoping
for
a
tad
more
alcohol
to
warm
me
on
the
cool
winter
evening
smell
is
caramel
malt
taste
is
grainy
and
sweet
medium
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
lager
but
could
use
more

a
dunkel
lager
relatively
dark
smooth
lager
decent
and
enjoyable
serving
type
bottle
the
taste
is
also
sweet
and
malty
with
a
quick
clean
finish
nothing
special
but
not
difficult
to
drink
just
ok
not
really
loving
it
very
basic
dunkel
watery
and
needed
more
flavor
this
had
a
very
clean
light
nose
nutty
sweet
malt
and
soft
caramel
the
color
is
excellent
aglow
with
a
lovely
copper
hue
good
head
of
tan
foam
that
fell
well
taste
is
clean
crisp
a
bit
bitter
in
the
finish
the
sweetness
is
good
and
theres
a
bite
from
carbonation
the
hops
jump
inmid
palate
with
some
herbal
and
finish
it
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
alongside
a
cool
dark
brown
sugar
crisp
end
overall
not
bad
i
would
have
again
people
really
seem
to
be
digging
this
beer
this
year
and
saranac
certainly
seems
to
be
pushing
it
with
twelves
sixes
and
a
mixed
pack
appearance
they
appear
to
have
found
one
they
like
kind
of
their
answer
to
sams
winter
lager
i
guess
but
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
all
that
much
to
me
its
generic
overly
malty
and
never
crisp
enough
in
the
finish
that
said
though
it
is
a
little
something
different
with
a
rich
but
dry
malt
base
copper
and
caramel
in
color
and
with
fine
carbonation
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
develop
like
a
lager
should
and
frankly
isnt
anything
worth
getting
excited
over
its
got
a
little
too
much
body
for
sessioning
but
i
could
see
it
as
a
crowd
pleaser
and
a
good
cooking
beer
ive
been
impressed
with
recent
saranac
releases
but
this
one
is
nothing
special
at
all
overall
its
an
ok
beer
but
not
up
to
the
usual
high
standards
for
some
of
the
other
saranac
lagers
light
flavor
light
taste
head
gone
in
seconds
lots
of
bubbles
very
simple
imo
carmel
flavor
is
there
but
not
too
strong
pours
a
highly
carbonated
dark
red
very
little
head
smells
slightly
fruity
a
little
carmely
malt
honestly
not
much
going
on
up
here
taste
is
disappointingly
similar
not
too
much
going
on
here
strong
hearty
malt
backbone
but
like
most
dunkels
thats
all
it
offers
its
a
very
drinkable
malty
beer
good
for
the
winter
and
overall
a
solid
brew
but
nothing
id
seek
out
go
for
roastier
and
darker
wow
this
beer
lacks
everything
that
a
good
beers
has
it
doesnt
good
its
doesnt
stand
out
in
a
crownd
it
doesnt
make
me
want
to
drink
it
it
makes
me
want
to
pour
down
arain
saranac
disappionts
me
too
much
not
going
here
every
again
overall
not
bad
for
a
new
beer
from
a
saranac
holiday
sampler
pours
dark
amber
with
good
head
and
excellent
lacing

bready

notes
midpalate
with
some
nice

and
barley
slight
dry
bitterness
on
the
back
palate
good
malt
and
nut
aftertaste
most
winter
lagers
rely
on
spice
and
some
citrus
this
takes
it
back
to
an
older
english
style
brown
lager
refreshing
and
still
fittingly
right
for
the
colder
months

out
of
5
good
great
great
lager
super
enjoyable
going
to
be
one
of
my
gotos
all
winter
o
nice
offering
by
saranac
a
solid
twonote
session
lager
thatd
make
you
glad
to
have
another
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
copper
like
amber
color
with
a
very
light
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
reminded
me
of
most
lagers
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
decent
i
found
it
very
easy
to
to
drink
but
it
didnt
have
more
really
going
for
it
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
pretty
good
again
its
was
drinkable
smooth
and
easy
going
overall
its
a
typical
brew
from
saranac
oa
decent
saranac
product
this
is
a
great
winter
seasonal
from
matt
i
think
the
original
name
of
this
beer
was
winter
lager
but
they
changed
it
to
lake
affect
lager
a
couple
years
ago
overall
a
slightly
weightier
saranac
for
the
winterbottles
scene
is
snowy
and
sentimental
but
the
beer
is
what
it
isserviceable
but
not
outstanding
fair
for
the
price
taste
starts
with
grain
husks
medium
tart
in
the
middle
and
a
balanced
close
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
smooth
and
drinkability
is
alright
as
well
wish
list
of
more
malt
depth
and
less
tartness
here
d
meh
its
ok
and
there
are
no
glaring
flaws
but
its
unmemorable
and
id
pass
on
it
pretty
good
lager
that
features
a
prominent
malt
and
a
nice
coloration
slight
toastiness
seperates
it
from
the
märzen
crowd
overall
nice
flavor
here
possibly
now
a
true
dunkel
but
a
big
flavored
lager
thats
well
worth
checking
out
and
a
nice
part
of
this
variety
pack
overall
pretty
average
but
not
offensive
a
good
party
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
light
brown
body
with
two
fingers
of
beige
head
head
persists
quite
a
while
and
laces
glass
well
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malts
tastes
the
same
as
nose
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
to
cut
the
sweetness
very
well
balanced
the
carbonation
dances
lightly
on
the
tounge
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
its
not
overly
impressive
as
part
of
a
mix
pack
it
was
a
good
try
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
otherwise
overall
interesting
beer
maybe
a
touch
to
much
chocolate
for
a
dunkel
and
not
quite
dark
enough
but
still
a
very
good
solidly
drinkable
beer
easy
drinking
lager
chocolte
infused
malts
carry
the
freight
rich
and
smmoth
malty
notes
abound
pleasant
enough
decent
cool
weather
quaffer
o
not
a
true
to
style
munich
dunkel
tastes
like
a
big
oktoberfest
or
even
a
bock
nevertheless
a
good
beer
truly
winter
in
its
scope
first
of
the
winter
seasonal
pack
and
my
first
beer
from
saranac
pours
a
very
inviting
ruby
redish
copper
nice
lacing
and
head
retention
smells
very
malty
with
some
caramel
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
mild
hop
bite
to
finish
overall
its
pretty
good
lager
o
up
against
the
other
choices
in
this
years
saranac
winter
pack
id
probably
take
this
last
that
doesnt
mean
this
is
a
bad
beer
though
it
is
actually
very
solid
and
can
do
for
a
lighter
break
from
the
heavier
stouts
and
pale
ales
found
in
that
particular
mix
o
average
example
of
the
style
and
i
wish
i
had
more
opportunity
to
drink
and
sample
some
of
the
better
german
beer
in
the
category
to
get
a
true
example
of
the
style
the
only
other
dunkel
lager
that
i
have
sampled
is
paulaner
dunkel
which
was
much
better
than
this
od
a
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
appreciate
the
subtleties
low
enough
abv
to
drink
several
of
a
delicate
hop
and
malt
taste
executed
well
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
shows
minimal
retention
and
lace
smells
of
caramel
and
butterscotch
mostly
smell
is
quite
sweet
with
little
to
no
hop
presence
taste
is
a
little
better
that
the
aroma
caramel
and
burnt
sugars
with
a
hint
of
earthy
spicy
hops
medium
body
and
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slick
sweet
mouthfeel
i
find
it
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
call
this
a
dunkel
but
i
guess
it
is
a
darker
lager
easy
enough
to
drink
but
again
nothing
too
special
this
is
a
very
nicely
simply
crafted
beer
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
reminds
me
of
a
samuel
adams
boston
lager
but
with
a
different
malt
backing
its
almost
just
as
good
to
if
not
as
good
this
is
my
first
sampling
from
the
saranac
winter
12
pack
and
its
definitely
off
to
a
good
start
with
this
one
overall
pretty
good
considering
this
is
a
mass
produced
beer
this
makes
a
good
choice
for
a
winter
seasonal
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
huge
billowing
white
head
that
settled
down
to
reveal
some
subtle
lacing
that
was
quite
nice
smell
was
of
caramel
grains
and
breads
yeast
primarily
taste
was
typical
brown
lager
some
subtle
spiceness
great
all
around
flavor
lots
of
earthy
tones
with
a
ever
so
slight
sweetness
mostly
malts
on
this
one
this
was
a
decent
beer
extremely
sessionable
and
a
samn
fine
call
decent
an
ok
addition
to
variety
pack
nothing
i
wouldnt
drink
again
but
nothing
special
o
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
thats
not
saying
its
bad
its
just
not
any
better
than
any
other
dunkel
out
there
if
you
love
dukels
then
give
it
a
try
if
not
your
not
missing
much
overall
a
tasty
and
seemingly
authentic
lager
o
this
was
a
really
tasty
dunkel
lager
nicely
done
this
is
a
medium
bodied
offering
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
which
imparts
an
overall
smooth
creamy
feel
for
less
than
6
abv
the
alcohol
was
quite
noticeable
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
it
lacked
balance
and
overall
just
made
me
feel
like
the
yeast
never
fully
got
around
to
doing
their
job
in
drying
this
out
yet
more
noticeable
alcohol
in
this
style
would
not
be
welcomed
worth
giving
a
try
just
to
say
you
did
but
one
was
enough
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
it
again
notes
overall
it
follows
the
same
basic
saranac
formula
of
an
easy
drinking
well
balanced
beer
with
a
decent
flavor
profile
based
on
its
style
d
one
of
saranacs
better
beers
i
could
drink
these
pretty
easily
the
metallic
not
is
really
the
key
negative
smooth
mouthfeel
is
the
high
point
pretty
good
beereasy
to
drink
would
drink
it
again
not
half
bad
but
when
it
comes
to
dunkel
lagers
i
am
always
looking
to
the
original
stuff
worth
a
try
the
flavor
is
nonoffensive
and
noncompelling
theres
a
bit
of
an
earthy
aftertaste
i
didnt
enjoy
that
much
all
i
could
think
of
was
that
this
beer
is
a
less
flavorful
and
watered
down
version
of
sam
adams
boston
lager
stick
with
the
sam
d
i
sadly
drank
my
last
one
today
and
overall
was
pretty
great
was
pretty
comparable
to
most
amber
lagers
but
as
a
dunkel
lager
i
really
loved
the
style
great
brew
drinkability
is
ok
goes
down
easy
and
pleasant
enough
taste
abv
a
bit
high
for
a
session
beer
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
di
am
actually
quite
pleased
with
this
an
easy
drinking
dark
lager
yet
that
has
some
complexity
and
remains
fairly
true
to
the
style
d
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
but
for
some
reason
my
mind
keeps
switching
to
brown
ale
on
this
i
think
perhaps
a
little
sweeter
then
need
be
either
way
its
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
good
amount
of
flavor
without
overdoing
anything
very
impressive
for
a
lager
which
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
except
samuel
adams
until
now
will
remember
this
next
time
a
craft
brewer
offers
a
lager
im
not
saying
its
one
of
the
best
but
its
a
damn
good
throwback
session
brew
d
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
a
couple
of
however
it
is
only
available
in
mixers
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
sweet
caramel
and
a
hint
of
standard
lager
smells
in
the
taste
caramel
and
small
fruit
hints
inside
of
a
standard
lager
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
caramel
like
aftertaste
ok
but
still
a
lager
with
a
hint
of
roast
d
would
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
i
am
a
fan
of
this
style
and
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
a
good
twist
on
the
lager
style
dunkel
hells
yeah
overall
could
use
some
more
balance
but
its
good
i
chose
this
as
the
first
beer
out
of
the
gate
for
the
new
years
eve
festivities
perhaps
this
one
should
have
been
second
or
third
the
sweetness
and
caramel
flavors
are
nice
but
everything
else
seems
rather
muted
a
decent
other
than
the
same
old
lager
shit
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
this
is
a
decent
brew
at
a
good
price
interesting
lager
not
that
complex
but
decent
enough
d
a
nonetoospecial
yet
mostly
maltforward
dark
german
lager
emulation
i
can
appreciate
the
german
specialty
malts
and
the
near
6
abv
even
adds
some
much
needed
warming
and
richness
to
the
cold
winter
season
d
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
one
i
bought
the
saranac
winter
sampler
and
thought
this
would
be
my
least
favorite
but
so
far
i
like
it
better
than
the
others
nice
suprise
i
am
really
digging
this
beer
pours
nicely
with
a
thin
white
head
and
strong
carbonation
smells
strongly
of
malted
barley
and
finishes
dry
with
subtle
hoppiness
there
is
nothing
particularly
wintry
about
this
one
although
it
is
a
solid
german
lager
that
is
very
drinkable
very
sessionable
for
me
this
a
good
be
for
a
chilly
winter
eve
pours
amber
gold
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
decent
retention
and
a
good
amount
of
laceing
aroma

maltsdark
fruit
and
nut
body
is
thinner
than
expected
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
of
brown
sugarcaramelfig
and
other
dark
fruits
nutty
finish
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
nice
cheers
this
is
one
of
saranacs
best
maltforward
beers
i
can
think
of
its
very
robust
for
its
abv
and
has
slight
qualities
of
a
bock
or
dopplebock
to
me
its
depth
of
flavor
makes
it
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
again
and
again
in
one
sitting
but
its
a
good
winter
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
complex
malt
flavor
this
is
the
most
drinkable
of
the
recent
saranac
beers
ive
tasted
i
thought
both
the
smell
and
taste
was
quite
exceptional
smooth
very
little
bitterness
yet
very
full
of
flavors
none
of
which
were
negative
it
didnt
produce
much
head
and
like
others
have
mentioned
the
carbonation
was
somewhat
fizzy
like
a
soft
drink
all
in
all
this
is
one
i
will
go
back
to
again
and
recommend
to
many
friends
and
family
whom
like
beer
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
best
gateway
beers
for
anyone
whom
has
only
had
macroadjunct
stuff
into
the
world
of
craft
beers
much
more
flavorful
than
yuengling

of
nonstop
slow
upward
bound
carbination
bubbles
the
aroma
is
not
overly
distinctive
but
i
get
a
good
maltiness
and
a
thin
unusual
hoppiness
thrown
in
the
taste
is
nice
and
bitter
with
a
light
but
crisp
hoppiness
on
the
tail
end
it
was
quite
drinkable
drinkability
i
got
more
than
i
expected
with
this
enough
flavor
for
the
style
and
the
sessionability
factor
to
the
qpr
is
pretty
high
seems
like
a
good
brew
for
winter
too
an
apt
choice
for
the
mix
12
this
year
d
a
very
solid
offering
from
saranac
fx
matt
doesnt
get
enough
credit
for
the
brews
they
make
an
easy
drinker
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
if
available
in
sixpack
form
i
would
pickup
on
occasion
d
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
not
to
most
complex
but
it
is
also
far
from
an
empty
lager
the
flavors
stay
balanced
overall
and
the
mouthfeel
matches
nicely
dbefore
i
drank
this
beer
i
was
wondering
what
a
lager
was
doing
in
the
winter
mix
after
having
the
beer
it
was
a
good
inclusion
great
for
a
cold
night
like
tonight
not
a
bad
beer
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
totally
to
style
doesnt
have
any
munich
malt
flavor
and
seems
to
be
a
tad
light
for
the
style
not
horrible
but
a
far
cry
from
the
style
was
good
by
itself
but
i
think
id
tire
of
this
if
i
started
to
session
it
a
decent
simple
beer
12oz
bottle
from
their
winter
mixed
12pk
pours
a
crystalclear
brown
body
with
a
thin
film
of
shortlived
head
smells
toasty
and
chocolatey
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
come
right
through
with
a
heavy
toast
presence
too
and
just
a
hint
of
nut
toward
the
finish
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
and
fairly
drinkable
excellent
beer
possibly
the
best
of
the
six
a
great
fuller
body
definitely
what
i
like
to
see
for
a
quality
germanstyle
winter
beer
bright
initially
and
fading
to
a
lush
smooth
mouthfeel
mostly
slick
but
ending
semidry
certainly
a
drinkable
brew
thats
full
and
complex
without
being
taxing
on
the
palate
pours
a
dark
copper
hue
with
a
thick
white
head
that
recedes
to
about
a
half
inch
and
hangs
around
nicely
aromas
of
sweet
caramel
grains
and
a
huge
malt
presence
are
noticeable
the
taste
consists
of
bold
malty
and
sweet
notes
with
a
touch
of
hoppiness
a
bit
of
ripened
fruit
makes
its
way
to
the
taste
buds
as
well
with
definite
characteristics
of
dates
and
prunes
overall
the
mediumheavy
body
and
moderate
carbonation
blend
together
nicely
with
this
malt
forward
brew
another
solid
beer
from
saranac
d
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
it
wasnt
that
bad
but
nothing
really
stood
out
about
it
to
me
not
saranacs
best
beer
wouldnt
seek
out
again
gotta
love
the
annual
12
beers
of
xmas
pack
it
seems
like
as
a
whole
they
have
put
some
well
hopped
beers
into
the
mix
only
two
new
offerings
this
year
this
lake
effect
lager
seems
to
be
a
nice
german
style
dunkel
lager
at
first
glance
appears
a
dark
caramel
amber
bodied
with
a
nice
off
white
tan
colored
head
forming
thick
fine
bubbled
head
evenly
strung
thick
chunky
lacing
very
nice
look
going
on
poured
into
my
12
liter
sam
adams
krug
style
glass
aromatics
offer
up
dark
roasted
malt
slightly
nutty
touch
of
caramel
no
overt
sweetness
subtle
bready
german
malts
with
hallertau
herbal
spicy
leafy
toned
hops
coming
in
as
well
flavors
work
well
together
combining
a
semi
dry
roasted
malt
quality
hints
of
caramel
and
nut
with
earthyherbalspicy
hop
accents
a
beautiful
mix
of
true
german
style
brewing
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
sturdily
carbonated
as
the
style
typically
prescribes
to
wonderful
semi
dry
finish
not
a
sweet
or
hoppy
beer
just
a
beautifully
balanced
dunkel
lager
drinkability
overall
is
pretty
nice
no
problem
drinking
a
couple
bottles
of
this
stuff
wish
i
had
another
mixed
12
pack
to
top
off
the
glass
im
drinking
decent
beer
but
the
sweetness
could
be
tempered
by
a
heartier
level
of
bitterness
in
the
end
caramel
is
just
way
to
prevalent
saranac
lake
effect
lager
is
a
very
clear
blown
beer
with
a
dense
light
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
film
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
aroma
like
malt
extract
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
slightly
watery
finish
its
slightly
sweet
and
very
lightly
bittered
its
a
light
simple
flavor
and
the
bitterness
comes
out
more
at
the
finish
its
not
a
very
noteworthy
beer
but
its
quite
drinkable
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
like
the
smell
plenty
of
malts
a
light
hopping
considerable
sweetness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
saranac
has
offered
a
great
full
bodied
some
what
darker
lager
definately
worth
a
try
pours
a
deep
brown
color
nice
head
to
it
nice
malty
aroma
to
his
one
taste
is
medium
bodied
some
great
breadiness
to
it
a
touch
of
caramel
some
nice
malty
taste
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
beer
with
some
decent
taste
to
it
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
sampler
pack
a
lot
of
people
hate
on
saranac
but
this
is
for
sure
an
above
average
beer
that
i
would
never
turn
down
solid
brew
12oz
bottle
one
of
the
beers
from
the
12
beers
of
winter
mix
pack
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
small
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
molasses
earthiness
and
malts
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
nice
blend
of
malts
with
sweetness
a
bit
of
caramel
too
this
is
one
of
the
2
new
styles
by
saranac
in
the
winter
mix
12
and
is
a
decent
offering
d
another
drinkable
beer
from
saranac
not
to
be
bias
i
just
feel
these
are
great
are
all
great
gateway
brews
to
craft
lake
effect
can
be
drank
very
smoothly
all
winter
long
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
much
more
on
my
second
time
around
drinks
nicely
and
had
a
pleasant
taste
d
a
very
pleasant
surprise
form
this
saranac
sampler
along
with
bohemian
pilsner
this
is
a
big
winner
of
the
bunch
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
with
slightly
above
average
drinkability
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
its
full
of
fruity
yeast
esters
which
compliments
the
caramel
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
its
not
overly
complex
but
its
full
of
malt
flavora
solid
seasonal
d
goes
down
easy
and
is
rather
refreshing
slightly
warming
and
a
nice
coldweather
beer
just
nothing
particularly
special
if
you
like
a
lager
with
a
bit
of
character
this
one
is
worth
trying
better
for
a
cold
evening
in
the
northeast
than
a
barely
cool
evening
here
in
socal
and
a
bit
short
on
malty
complexity
but
its
a
clean
wellbrewed
and
moderately
satisfying
lager
